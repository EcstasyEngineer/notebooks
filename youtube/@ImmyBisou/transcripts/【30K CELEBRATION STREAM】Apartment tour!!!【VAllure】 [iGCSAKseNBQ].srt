00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
music

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:14,140
music

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:25,360
music

4
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:54,760
Thank you for coming to stream, you catch an app after the abduction,

5
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:09,160
no but I did go for a walk, I did go for a walk after the abduction, I should have caught an app though,

6
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:19,720
I should have napped instead, I needed one but I felt like I should have, I felt like I needed

7
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:34,000
exercise so I walked to Wendy's and ate food there, that's my exercise going to the restaurant,

8
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:43,040
walking to the restaurant. Proud of you, thank you, an app would have been nice but I feel like,

9
00:05:43,040 --> 00:06:00,520
I don't know, I feel like I was more, we call it, when you do activities, when you do things,

10
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:14,360
what'd you get? I got a Caesar salad and a burger, and a diet coke, that's right, I like diet coke,

11
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,520
I like diet coke, I know people don't like diet, I like diet, I know people are like,

12
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,160
oh diet coke tastes like flat soda, like flat, like old, like it's been sitting out, I like that,

13
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,120
I like that about it, I like the taste of it having been sitting out and not being fizzy anymore,

14
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:43,280
I like that taste, that tastes good to me, so happy 30k and almost 50k, thank you,

15
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:51,440
also as you can see in the pinned message on the stream, I did make a new video,

16
00:06:52,160 --> 00:07:04,400
it's with Momosa who now goes by Ruruneru, but I felt like it was more appropriate to tag her as

17
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:13,520
Momosa just because she doesn't have a YouTube channel as Ruruneru, I couldn't find one, so I

18
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,040
was like, I gotta tag her on YouTube somehow, I tagged her as Momosa but in the description,

19
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,680
you can find her links as Ruruneru, go support her as Ruruneru because she's not really

20
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,640
active as Momosa anymore, I will still love you even during these hard times, what do you mean

21
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:38,080
hard times, what do you mean hard times, you can't match my freak as I like diet soda,

22
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:46,880
hmm, distinct taste but I like non-aspartame diets, I don't know, they're all good,

23
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,120
thank you for the five dollars, it was in the plans, I'm not sure if it's still happening,

24
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,440
um, I could help make one because I do have experience like managing a Minecraft server,

25
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,320
but I feel like Porstrani and Manesan are like stretched thin, so if there will be it wouldn't be

26
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:32,720
very soon I guess, I don't really play Minecraft on stream because I don't know,

27
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,400
I just feel like it's not an entertaining game to play, I don't play many games on stream just

28
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,840
because I don't know, maybe it's just me but like, well I'm not a gamer and and too I just like,

29
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,360
I don't really watch a lot of gaming streams, like the reason I watch a stream is for the person,

30
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,640
so like gaming streams that are like too heavy on gaming, it's like I'm not here to watch you

31
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,120
sit there and play a game, I'm here to like talk to you, I'm here to talk to you, you know,

32
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,600
it is a good app game I guess, I was a little worried too though because I've seen like comments

33
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,960
of people being like oh blank is playing Minecraft again cringe and I was like damn what's wrong

34
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:24,080
with Minecraft, you prefer Zatsu's, personally as a viewer yes, I do not care for the block game,

35
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,480
see, people don't really care too much about block game, even though it is popular,

36
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,560
no matter what you do I'm here for the cute sister, thank you,

37
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,320
that's why I actually, even though I've done a lot of collabs, I don't actually watch many

38
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,800
collabs as a viewer either because when I'm following a streamer like I'm following you for you,

39
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,200
not to watch you collab with someone else, that sounds mean, but I don't personally like watching

40
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,440
collabs, I tend to stay away from collabs, so even though I collab a lot with people, I collab

41
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,800
a lot with people just to show people like hey, we're not lonely as fuck, we got, we got friends,

42
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,160
you know, like that kata collab was so fun, kata so cute, does she call herself kata, no it's kata

43
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,640
right, I know she's cute, she's fun, I really enjoyed collabing with her, she's really friendly,

44
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,160
as a clipper I honestly prefer zatsu's, yeah, that too, that too,

45
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,000
I like some collabs, but in general I don't really like them either, yeah, I, I understand,

46
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,000
kata was a trip,

47
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,600
would you rather infinite bacon but no games, or infinite games but no games,

48
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:48,000
what, thank you for the $5, do you mean infinite games but no bacon,

49
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:55,520
I would rather infinite bacon, of course, of course,

50
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,080
was that a plan or schedule collab that I forgot about or was it gorilla, so

51
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:12,720
um, I think we decided on like Tuesday or Wednesday that we were gonna have the stream on Friday,

52
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,120
it was very last minute and she didn't put her, she didn't put her stream waiting room up until

53
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,400
this morning, I think, so I felt like, I just didn't, it kind of slipped my mind until like the

54
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,240
day before and I was like, oh shit, I planned to collab with kata, oops, so it was, it was pretty

55
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:40,320
last minute, yeah, infinite games but no games, I feel like Amy's been asked that before, I feel

56
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:49,920
like I've been asked that before too, yeah, sounds familiar, um, that was a joke from the youtuber

57
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,760
are you gay? why are you acting so gay?

58
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,760
I don't watch jay schlatt, I've heard of jay schlatt before, I don't even know if I'm pronouncing

59
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:09,600
the name right, jay schlatt, schlatt, thank you for the $1, I want to know did you ban my main

60
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,760
account blue brawler or was it a shadow ban, do you want me to look up right now if you're banned,

61
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:25,200
sure, I'll do it, just for you, just for you, but I have personally not banned a lot of people,

62
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,960
if I have to personally ban you myself, you've done some messed up stuff, if I have to go out of

63
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:39,840
my way to log into my youtube account and manually type your name into the banned chatter section,

64
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,680
then you fucked up, but otherwise, how do I even see that actually, I forgot, I don't do it often,

65
00:12:46,800 --> 00:13:01,280
um, oh here it is community, um, hidden users, oh, um, man, there's like hundreds of people here,

66
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:12,160
can I control f, oh yeah, yeah, you're banned, uh, I can't tell you why, you'll have to ask a

67
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,280
moderator, actually I don't think you can talk to moderators, please ban me, okay,

68
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,680
okay, I'd use your on this channel, thank you for the ten dollars,

69
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:37,920
I'm kidding, I'll unban you, I'll unban you, don't ask to be banned, I will ban you,

70
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,560
like don't ask for it, I will do it, I actually forgot, okay here it is,

71
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,400
you guys are weird,

72
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,120
okay, it means a people pleaser, kind of, yeah,

73
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,320
so the guy who was banned is here on an alt, he says, yeah, I mean, I don't know what the reason

74
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,800
was, so I feel like I don't have, because sometimes people get banned for smaller reasons,

75
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,680
for example, if you comment something kind of rude, I'll just ban you sometimes,

76
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,680
like on YouTube videos, if you say like something even remotely rude, I'll just ban you, so you

77
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,040
know, I don't care, watch your mouth, because it could happen again, it could happen any moment,

78
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,840
okay, watch your mouth, don't be mean to my, don't be mean to my little sister,

79
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,360
thank you for the membership, I've been a bad boy, oh, time me out, oh no,

80
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,040
okay, fine, I'll time you out, there you go,

81
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,800
is this what you guys want, easy trigger, sometimes of course, why would I let someone

82
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,200
comment like even remotely rude stuff, you know, is that a new type of masochism, apparently,

83
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,080
apparently, and sometimes people don't know it's rude either, because sometimes people are just

84
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:16,080
and don't realize that what they're saying is kind of rude, is this stream dumb, yes, chat needs

85
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:29,520
correction, I'm the emperor, all right, I guess, I guess, if we all have to be banned, I can't ban

86
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:39,040
you all, I'm not going to ban everyone, I don't have time to ban you and then unban you,

87
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,960
my autism has been a curse in that regard for forever, rude without realizing it, yeah,

88
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:55,120
but obviously, I don't know what everyone's situation is, so I can't be like, oh, maybe

89
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,200
they have autism and don't realize that they're being rude, no, I slam the hammer,

90
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:08,960
I don't care, she does as we ask, that's not what I mean,

91
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,840
that's not what I mean, thank you for becoming a member, it's only a shame if light teasing gets

92
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,120
mistaken as bullying, no, I can tell when someone is like lightly teasing, usually, obviously,

93
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,400
things get misinterpreted through text sometimes, because we're all texting, technically, chat is

94
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:51,120
texting, but yeah, thank you for the $1, oopsies, I keep closing stream elements like an idiot,

95
00:16:51,920 --> 00:17:01,120
keep it opening, congratulations on 30k, very much deserved, thank you, wait a minute,

96
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,000
did I write 20k in my powerpoint?

97
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:13,840
no, I said 30k, okay, I'll show you my powerpoint now,

98
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:22,080
you can put two year subscribers chat on or something like that and we'll all be banned,

99
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,560
no, I won't do that, I won't do that, I won't do that, don't worry,

100
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:36,160
if we break 50k during the 30k celebration, that would be cool, but I don't think we'll make it,

101
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,520
let me see, I think we need like 800 more, I need about 800 more, 850?

102
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,520
850, I don't, I don't think I'll get 850, unless I like post a short right now and it blows up,

103
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,840
like immediately, I believe I'll reach 50k during this stream, but that's okay, I also don't even

104
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,240
have a post, a short to post it right now, do not make 800 bots please, you're gonna get my channel

105
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:18,560
banned, for botting, do not, thank you, it is time to post the out of out of short, I don't have it,

106
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,120
I don't have it, I sent it to get edited but I didn't get it back yet, all right anyways let me

107
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,760
open the slideshow and go here

108
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:47,760
okay

109
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:59,760
let me make that a little smaller, here it is, it means apartment tour, thank you for 30k, yippee

110
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,520
thank you for 30k

111
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:14,480
I will make 800 real people love you, thank you, you can try, I think it would be better if I

112
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,920
reached that myself, but thank you, not in Minecraft this time actually, this time it's real, this time

113
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:26,240
it's real life, it unfortunately my real um place looks nothing like the Minecraft place,

114
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:33,840
unfortunately it looks nothing like that, already gets an A plus for design, oh I just got it off

115
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:44,320
of, you can literally see the watermark on the side, slidesmania.com, I just got it from slidesmania.com

116
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:52,800
all right let's get started I guess, um next slide, all right we're gonna start with a little

117
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,520
disclaimer or a side note, when I see apartment tours or room tours from a lot of youtubers

118
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,480
they tend to have really nice places because obviously you know you don't want to do an

119
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,040
apartment tour if your apartment is ugly and um I feel the same way, I'm like maybe I shouldn't

120
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,960
have said I'll do an apartment tour because there's not really anything interesting to see, um

121
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,680
yeah so in no way is this apartment aesthetic or pretty, um please don't have high expectations

122
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,720
okay, don't don't feel like oh she's gonna have like those Sanrio rooms on tiktok

123
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,760
or stuff like that, um I moved out as 17 and have I've had no financial support from my parents

124
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:41,600
ever since then, so this place kind of looks rough, um it's not a fancy place at all and uh

125
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,240
but it's mine so I like it so show your mouth I don't want to see, I don't want to see any comments

126
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,400
like this place looks ghetto, it is ghetto, it is ghetto, um yeah so and I was a bro college

127
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,560
student until recently okay I did my best with the decor with with what I had which is goodwill

128
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:08,160
and my mom and well not my mom but like my mom's old furniture and amazon.com and sometimes when

129
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:18,640
my mom comes over like um like what's it called furniture stores we usually know

130
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:28,080
now you're just broke shut damn you live like this yeah also I was raised by a hoarder mom

131
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,600
okay and my hoarder mom was raised by a hoarder grandma so I'm a little bit of a hoarder too

132
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,760
so if so if you think like wow this place is kind of cluttered it's because I'm a little

133
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,440
bit of a hoarder okay I'm a little I have more than enough Tupperware and most of it does not match

134
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,000
and most of it does not match yes generational hoarding it's it's it's it's definitely busy I'll

135
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,600
just say that it's it's definitely a busy apartment we don't do minimalism around here okay we we

136
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:07,360
we do not do minimalism I'm working on it it's um it's definitely I mean it's so bad but it's

137
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:15,520
I guess not as bad as it could be maybe rat room probably more interesting than Amy's room you

138
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,040
think I have a separate room for my rats I mean I'd love to one day have a rat room but no my rats

139
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:34,960
live with me in my room you live like a real person I mean I I guess an average I don't even know

167
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,320
this is just me or a stream kind of blurry I think it's because I put my bit rate too high

168
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,960
I need to lower my bit rate

169
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,720

179
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,760
space here for anything but this is where my ac is this is my piano over here this is my little

180
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:48,640
piano chair um what up this is the rat cage obviously less clutter than mine that's good

181
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,720
that's good how long is that Pikachu my aunt my aunt gave me that Pikachu when I visited her

182
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,320
she's very nice she always gives me well one of my aunts I have a lot of aunts um

183
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,920
but she always gives me like me and my mom like really nice gifts whenever we go and visit her

184
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:09,040
so she's really nice what is that poster Pikachu oh this one says ho and a easy

185
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,520
ho and a easy

186
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,360
needs more plushies I know I'm getting there I'm getting there um there's more um what's it called

187
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,360
there's more posters here but I didn't really take pictures of them

188
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,960
how many times have you been buried in plushie of avalanche none this keeps them all together up here

189
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,640
and then these are usually like used to sleep bro I need like five plushies to sleep

190
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,640
the the net has never fallen the net has never fallen um this is more plushies and like storage

191
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,440
this is a clock that I never used but I have it because it's cute this is more storage this is

192
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:52,800
storage here uh these are just cute little figures this is like my underwear plus art drawer um

193
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,200
this is the rat cage this is I kind of sometimes use this whiteboard to like write down stuff I

194
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:04,560
need to do this is some art that I was gifted by a friend as you can tell and this so I have

195
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:11,200
those tiktok led lights right and they actually used to go like past here throughout the whole

196
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:18,400
ceiling um I have them down here on my bed oh hold on I have them down here um why the ac

197
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:26,720
instead of a window unit because my windows are like they open they open like across um

198
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:33,600
so there are like zero window units that fit in windows that open like across like that instead of

199
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:43,920
up and down um window units window ac units um are made for windows that open like top to bottom

200
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:50,240
if that makes sense I really don't know how to explain it but my windows open side to side

201
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,120
does that make sense so I need to have this instead the pile of plushies ominously hanging

202
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:05,280
over the bed they could fall down at any moment I thank you for the five dollars yeah it makes

203
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:11,440
sense yeah yeah horizontal they've never fallen before I even had the the polar bear up here at

204
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:19,440
one point um and it has not fallen on me they open like a door um no a door opens like outwards

205
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,800
slash inwards this just opens side to side like a like a sliding glass door kind of like that yeah

206
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:34,240
so yeah um yeah it slides horizontally rather than vertically all of my windows do that so

207
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:43,280
there is no window I can put an ac unit on um I have my iPad on the bed I think these are

208
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:48,720
hair clips I'm not sure what those are um I think that's everything here on this side

209
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:57,520
very interesting very cool um yeah right there's the other side of my room this is my ethernet

210
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:10,320
cord that connects to my um pc I do use ethernet to stream um and I have to put it um up on the

211
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,840
ceiling because otherwise the rats will chew on it yeah they'll chew on it so I have to put it on

212
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,160
the ceiling obviously this is where I'm sitting right now literally I'm sitting right here right

213
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:26,640
now um but yeah these this this this this was what the whole room looked like with all the lights

214
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:33,120
but my rats actually chewed on the other side like the lights on the other side of the room so um

215
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,200
yeah um it doesn't work anymore I need to get I need to get more lights for the other side of the room

216
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,800
you can put an ac unit in the sliding window you just need to use a couple extra parts to make

217
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:54,560
sure it doesn't jank yeah I I've considered it but I just feel like it's too much work and it's no

218
00:31:54,560 --> 00:32:00,240
different than the one I'm using right now like I'll it I don't know how to explain it like it's

219
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,880
still gonna be loud and noisy and annoying and it's gonna be really really annoying to take

220
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:14,400
out of the window when it's winter so yeah they were on the ceiling no I'm saying I can't I can't

221
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,520
put this wire anywhere but the ceiling because the rats will chew on it um this is the sweater that

222
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:25,680
a lot of people liked because you can see my boobas through it um I have posters on the wall like

223
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:32,640
the the Hello Kitty and and Hatsune Miku the monitor on the right looks smaller than your keyboard

224
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,360
it is a smaller monitor but it's not smaller than my keyboard but it is a smaller monitor

225
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,520
you don't need to take a window ac unit out during the winter but you'll hear outside

226
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,280
how am I supposed to record if you can hear outside I record ASMR like the the 3DO is super

227
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:56,240
super sensitive the 3DO literally hears my rats sneeze like the 3DO hears footsteps from downstairs

228
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,840
like the 3DO hears everything I can't keep my window open they need to be closed so I would

229
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,040
need to take the ac unit out all the time it's a good sweater I'm glad you like that sweater

230
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:17,520
um I don't know what else this is about the calendar um yeah that was about it

231
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,320
is that sound perfect stuff on the walls it sure is I don't know if it helps but I use it anyways

232
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:32,800
because it's fancy rats sneeze ASMR they they don't sneeze that often yeah the 3DO can literally

233
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,000
hear your thoughts it means like someone would be walking on the street and screaming the address

234
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:48,320
for no reasons honestly honestly the 3DO hears everything so I I cannot do anything with the

235
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:56,160
with the window open I'm not selling that sweater I like that sweater I have two pairs of headphones

236
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:02,720
this one is a bluetooth headphone for just casual and then this one is the headphones I actually use

237
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:11,200
to like record ASMR it's like a really technical technical like fancy pair of headphones um and

238
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,000
it's really sound proofy and I don't know I I think they're good headphones they they make

239
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,760
everything sound really good so yeah you your room is such a stereotypical girly room thank you

240
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:27,600
I'm actually happy to to hear that and not and not see like comments like wow your room is kind

241
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:35,280
of cluttered and dirty looking also the rats chewed on my um door here so yeah also the

242
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:42,560
the floor is dirty because I'm a dirty person that's why the floor is dirty I don't know what else

243
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:52,320
there is um they don't want to say I have a bunch of bags a solid rat room out of 10

244
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,840
dang girl you live like this

245
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
you acted like it was bad it's super normal and girly the bedroom is probably the cutest

246
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,520
room in the place the rest is kind of meh yeah

247
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:16,720
is your pc on the carpeted floor uh I have this um oh maybe a little bit yeah maybe like half

248
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:25,520
but I have this like desk like map floor map I want to see the fridge I'll show you my fridge

249
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,880
I'll show you my fridge okay next so I wanted to take a picture of this specifically because this

250
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:41,040
is my this is my wire organization what's it called my wire management this is my wire

251
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,640
almost everything is covered in wire protectors because the rats will chew on everything the

252
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,640
only thing that's not covered in wire protectors is this pink wire because that's for my mouse and

253
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,200
the wire protector um weighs down my mouse a lot so it becomes really difficult to use but everything

254
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,920
else is basically covered in wire protectors cable management yeah this is my cable management

255
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,000
hardly the worst I've seen that's good I feel like it doesn't look that bad because all of the

256
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,120
wires are like different colors and it makes it look a little bit cleaner it hurts

257
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,040
can't you get a wireless mouse I can't my computer just doesn't really work with bluetooth

258
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,800
I have the option to use bluetooth it will connect but it will not work well it will it

259
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,640
will be very very laggy and disconnect all the time and cut out all the time I don't know what's

260
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,760
wrong with my pc so I have to use wires for everything I have to use wires for my keyboard

261
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:53,920
for my mouse for my headphones for everything um so yeah um my wireless mice have dongles

262
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,200
yeah but like it doesn't work it just doesn't work not even with anything I don't know why

263
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,600
I don't know what's wrong with my pc like like it connects like they they connect to each other um

264
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:12,960
and they they do kind of work sort of I don't know what's wrong like it'll work with like the the

265
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,560
bluetooth stuff I use will work with everything it will work with my laptop with my phone um

266
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,280
with my ipad like it'll work with everything except for my pc I don't know what the problem is

267
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:31,680
um so I just use wired stuff yeah probably because it has to go through the desk

268
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,000
maybe I don't really know I will not put a new pc on throne no no no no no no I

269
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,040
my pc's okay the way it is don't feel don't feel uh don't feel pressure to get me a new pc

270
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,840
um yes you will see the inside of my fridge

271
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,400
all right so that's my wire management next is the rat cage

272
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:13,680
um no don't spoil me don't spoil me don't spoil me wired stuff is fine wired stuff is fine it worked

273
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,920
fine I just sometimes have to replace the wires because the rats will chew on it

274
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:29,760
all right this is my rat cage um it doesn't need cleaning it is it is time to be cleaned um but

275
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,000
you have to remember that these are rats okay these are like trash animals they're the equivalent

276
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,240
of like raccoons um they will do everything they possibly can to make a mess out of their cage

277
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,560
like the next day after you clean it so it's dirty it's really dirty

278
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,280
if your motherboard has bluetooth built-in and you're using an adapter you have to disable

279
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,760
one or the other bro I don't know I don't know anything about PCs I I will I am okay with my

280
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:07,680
wires do not buy me a new pc living better than me I mean it's just a cage this is a very very

281
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:16,240
standard oh why are you acting so gay rollin legend 99 underscore tipped $5 pc fund no do not

282
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,720
do not send pc money but thank you for the five dollars um this is only the top part of the cage

283
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:27,440
but this is a very standard cage for a rats um I don't know this is one of them in here I think

284
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,240
they all usually like to sleep in one of these pods here but sometimes they'll sleep here

285
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,840
but anytime I put blankets anywhere they will just move the blankets like these two blankets

286
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:42,320
used to be on either side of this but they just move the blankets all the time so yeah

287
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,360
and then this is the bottom of their cage it's a lot more empty than the top

288
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,000
um because you can tell that they've been trying to chew on this wire but it has the

289
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,920
wire protector on it's a lot more empty than the top of the cage because um they have mites or they

290
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:05,520
recently um had mites so I had to strip the cage and remove anything that couldn't be cleaned

291
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:11,680
and replace it with new stuff so I haven't completely finished like replacing um the new

292
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:18,960
stuff in here so yeah um this is the lower part and then this is the top part of the rat cage

293
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:30,640
pc fund stuff giving me a pc fund my pc is fine as it is if anything give me like

295
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:44,240
where's the mess am I blind it's a messy cage it's nowhere near a clean rat cage um but that's

296
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,800
because they're rats so yeah they just they're rats they will live are you okay why are you acting so

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,760
okay no I'm not doing that

324
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:14,000
okay um yeah that's not much this is the fan for when the poop is really bad I'm standing in my

325
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,680
bathtub right now so I could really get the scope I don't this is the heater I I don't know why there's

326
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,760
a heater in my bathroom but this is the bathroom heater I really I don't know why there's a heater

327
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:33,040
in the bathroom um but there is and I didn't even I didn't know this was a heater until like

328
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,000
very very recently because I looked at it one day and I was like wait why is there a knob here

329
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,160
and there's a knob there because you can change the heat level in the bathroom you can heat up the

330
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:50,320
bathroom and so I was like what the fuck and apparently the whole time I've been living here

331
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:56,160
I've had the bathroom heated uh at like medium level and I was like what the fuck the bathroom's

332
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:03,920
just been constantly heated you don't want to poop in the cold trust me I guess but still yeah

333
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:11,040
that's why there's a heater I mean the my my apartment stays generally pretty hot even without

334
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:21,200
the heater but yeah uh cold toilet seats I guess

335
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:31,120
yeah it's just something about warm stinky bathroom all right uh it's about it I don't know

336
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:38,240
I got a listerine I got skincare I got a razor I got fake plants

337
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,280
um that's about it for the bathroom there you're gonna see this is gonna be a very short

338
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:53,440
apartment tour because there's not much to show you um oops okay now it's the the hallway

339
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,160
question mark go through all of your makeup cabinet I don't have a makeup cabinet hold on

340
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:06,560
my makeup is all here all the way up here that's all the makeup I have all right here's the hallway

341
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:16,080
um it's kind of a hallway it leads into my windowless moisture must be bad the moisture is

342
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,640
awful I get mold in there all the time I have to like clean the ceiling like every two weeks

343
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:28,160
because it just accumulates so much mold um anyways it does get very hot in Canada people

344
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:35,360
are always like oh my god Canada is so cold you guys got polar bears and uh it glues like no

345
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:44,080
no we get very hot sometimes yeah this is my um hallway I got a mirror here with some vines

346
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:50,240
and some more fake plants this bag is just for holding my camera this is like a photo album

347
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:57,440
this is like my um agenda is that what it's called how tall is the mirror it's short it's a short

348
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:04,320
mirror I I I can't like it looks like like you could hang it but I I don't have the facilities

349
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:09,520
to hang the mirror so it's just kind of sitting there um eighth of a hallway yeah it's not really

350
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:18,400
a hallway the mirror is shorter than me yes the mirror is shorter than me um I have an agenda

351
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:24,640
where I try to plan shit but I always fail um this is like kitchen stuff and also my toothbrush

352
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:33,440
because I don't like to keep my toothbrush in my bathroom so yeah looks looks like my

353
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:40,240
hallway but wider and less cluttered really this is a very not wide hallway this is a very

354
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:47,920
not wide hallway at all but if you think it's wide that's good that's good this is a hallway okay

355
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,640
this is a hallway and it leads into my kitchen over here and my living room over here and this is like

356
00:47:53,600 --> 00:48:03,840
my um what's it called shoe box shoe box no toothbrush in the bathroom no I piss and

357
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,840
shit in that bathroom I don't want to keep my toothbrush in there I piss and shit in there

358
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,320
so yeah I don't want poop particles to get on my toothbrush shirek I guess I have shoes in here

359
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:19,520
and then in here too I have shoes and there's a sweater and umbrella and keys and stuff

360
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:31,120
oh it might be a small apartment but it has in me in it so it's worth everything oh it's so

361
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:36,000
cute you don't use a toothbrush case no I'm lazy I'm gonna have to clean the toothbrush case

362
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:45,200
oops all right now we have the living room now we got the living room ready okay it's very

363
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:51,600
cluttered it it's it's very very cluttered I'll I'll admit and it's got a lot of shit in it um

364
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:58,320
so let's let's go over this I guess all of this uh stuff on the wall is uh from Goodwill

365
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:06,400
this is a random AI generated tapestry I didn't know it was AI generated until it arrived at

366
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:13,520
my front door from Amazon and I was like oh fuck that's AI generated oh wow yo this place is huge

367
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:18,960
it looks very big I'll admit it definitely looks big but I wish I could take a picture of me in

368
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:24,960
it because it's very small um it's a very small apartment so but it does look pretty big

369
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,720
I'm standing in the kitchen taking this by the way I am this this little area here is the start

370
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:36,080
of the kitchen and this is the wire for my wi-fi my I keep my wi-fi stuff in my room

371
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,240
from Goodwill and no Jesus pictures why would I have Jesus in my

372
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,720
why would I have Jesus in my living room I think you'll be shocked at how normal your apartment

373
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,280
looks when you do a rate the pinpals room I should do that I should do a rate the pinpals room

374
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:57,200
I'm gonna do that or like rate your apartment yeah they sell AI generated tapestries on Amazon I

375
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,400
don't know why doesn't look that cluttered to me that's good my mom thinks it's very very cluttered

376
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:08,480
which is saying a lot for her because her place is awfully cluttered like way way way way more

377
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:14,320
cluttered than me but yeah is it is weird to see full carpet everywhere well the landlord

378
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:24,480
the landlord wanted carpet so we got carpet um where do I start okay okay um over here is my

379
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:30,400
tarantula uh tank I will show you that as well this is just a random squishmallow I sleep here on

380
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:37,440
this couch it it um extends into a uh couch bed I got this couch very recently before this couch

381
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,720
I had the couch that my mom gave me when I moved out um she got it from her ex boyfriend and she

382
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:50,560
kept it in her basement for like 10 years until she gave it to me and um a funny story about that

383
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:56,400
actually because one day I saw a little mouse like running across my living room or something and I was

384
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:03,840
like fuck I have a mouse oh no actually the the the history of of the mouse was I was taking out my

385
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:09,680
trash the couch does look big it's a pretty it's a decently big couch but I was taking out my

386
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:16,880
trash one day and there was a mouse like on top of my trash and it like jumped out and it ran around

387
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:23,280
my kitchen and finally I like it it hid somewhere and I was like fuck now I have a mouse in my apartment

388
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,840
I mean it was always there but at least it was contained into my cupboards where my trash is

389
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:33,760
but now it's just in my apartment everywhere um and so I couldn't I couldn't hold on I need water

390
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:45,680
I couldn't find um where it was for for like a really long time I couldn't find where it was hiding

391
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:51,120
but just randomly I would see the mouse in my apartment in the bathroom I would see it run

392
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:56,480
like run around I would see it like run into my closet like I would just randomly see the mouse um

393
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:05,600
until finally um I was I was I had finally gotten this new couch right so I was taking out my old

394
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:12,880
couch and as I was taking don't rats eat mice not I mean I don't think they really ever interacted

395
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,960
I think the mouse is smart enough not to go near the rats um you ignored the problem until it got

396
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:27,920
worse huh no no no it never really got worse um I didn't want to kill it and I I was too broke

397
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:36,160
this is really sad I was too broke to afford the um the humane mice traps that you could buy online

398
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:43,520
so I just let it be I was too broke to afford the mice trap so I was like you know what I'm just

399
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:49,920
gonna live with this mouse until the day that I was taking out my old couch I noticed that there was

400
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:57,440
like stuffing falling out of the couch as I was taking it outside and I was like that's weird I

401
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:05,680
mean it's an old couch so whatever that's weird rose and then food starting started falling out of

402
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:14,560
the couch food egg shells like bread crumbs like bread bread bunches started falling out of the couch

403
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:23,840
and I was like oh my god the mouse lived in my couch and I'm guessing the mouse is still in my couch

404
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:32,160
probably in some like um trash yard because I I asked a trash service to pick up my old couch

405
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,520
but I think the mouse lived in my couch and probably died in my couch and I was sleeping

406
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:44,640
and sitting on that couch literally monster under the bed

407
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,960
so um yeah it's most likely dead now um because I had gone a really long time without seeing it

408
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:58,720
anymore so I'm guessing it died in my couch and that's why I never found its dead body because it

409
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,560
died in my couch and um very happy I took that couch out because otherwise I would still have a

410
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:12,320
dead mouse in my couch um anyways um now I have a new couch and I don't think there's any mice in it

411
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:19,120
because I've never seen a mouse in my apartment since um it was just a lot of I got I got a pumpkin

412
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:24,960
pillow um I'm hopefully the I'm hopefully I'm hoping to get another pumpkin pillow because I used to

413
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,200
have two one orange and one green one but the orange one fell apart because it was really

414
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:36,160
shittily made um so I'm hoping once the Halloween season hits I can go to like marshals or or

415
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:42,320
winners or home cents and like find it a cute new pumpkin cat uh pumpkin pillows because they're really

416
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:51,200
cute um I feel like a dead mouse would produce quite a lot of smell you'd know if it was in there I

417
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:57,120
feel like it wouldn't though also there's smells in my apartment okay there's there's there's lots

418
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:12,320
of smells I'm not a clean person let's just say that um yeah um I put there's storage under this

419
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:17,360
couch too which is helpful I put a lot of bullshit under there this is the heater I cover it because

420
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:23,680
it's ugly but this is the heater during the winter um Canadian apartments um or at least where I live

421
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:27,920
are not legally required to have air conditioning but they are legally acquired to

422
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:33,920
required to have heating so luckily I have heating if it wasn't legally required my landlord probably

423
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:39,600
wouldn't put it in but it is legally acquired so luckily I don't I don't um I don't freeze to death

424
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:49,280
every winter uh what else so this couch is actually um this couch was actually the couch I had bought

425
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:56,400
to replace my old couch right after I had um kicked it out of my apartment um and then when I got it

426
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:03,600
I was like oh that's why it was so cheap because it's tiny and uncomfortable and like rock solid

427
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:13,600
and like mega thin so um I I didn't want to get rid of it when I actually was able to like afford a

428
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:20,640
new couch that's like actually squishy and comfy and big um because I'm a hoarder so I was like well

429
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:27,840
I guess it's gonna just sit there for now um yeah it's a really tiny couch and it's really hard

430
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:34,080
and it's really thin and I hate it but yeah you get what you pay for um

431
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:47,040
there was once a mouse that was dead so long and my pantry it shuffled up before we found it we

432
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,800
would have found it faster if it smelled that bad yeah like I don't know sometimes sometimes

433
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:56,960
things don't smell that bad what's in the drawer tower I don't show you what's in it but um this

434
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:04,080
one has just like random shit I don't know like tech stuff this one has um like winter stuff

435
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,680
I don't be honest I don't even know what's in here I think this is like old binders from school

436
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,480
I don't know what's in here I think no I don't know what's in here I need to go look I don't remember

437
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:23,040
um and here's like witchcraft stuff this is my um witchcraft altar where I do witchcraft

438
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,600
um

439
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:33,120
this is like a bookshelf there's on the bottom three levels also I cannot move these bookshelves

440
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,960
if I ever leave this apartment these bookshelves are gonna have to stay here because if I move

441
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:42,800
these bookshelves they will fall apart because I built them so if I built them they will fall apart

442
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:52,400
if I touch them too much like this one especially if I touch this one it falls apart so yeah um

443
00:57:53,600 --> 00:58:01,200
but there's like stuff here like a little dragon egg um this lamp that I don't use but I keep

444
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:06,400
anyways because I'm a hoarder um there's like wrap blankets there's rat stuff here rat stuff here

445
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:11,840
rat stuff here and some wrap blankets up here some binders I don't know nothing really interesting

446
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:20,240
uh I have like I have a Nintendo Wii and recently like a switch like a actual switch that connects

447
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:26,560
to the computer uh there's a lot of storage I need I need a lot of storage like because I have so

448
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:31,440
much shit because I'm a hoarder like storage is here storage is here storage is here storage is

449
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:37,520
here storage is inside the table as well storage is inside of the um inside of the couch obviously

450
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:43,120
this is all storage this is all storage for more witchcraft stuff um there's a table you can't

451
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,760
really see it but there's a table right here that is also storage for a bunch of bullshit um in the

452
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:53,040
hallway this is all storage for a bunch of bullshit like I just have too much stuff and

453
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:59,040
luckily um this isn't hoarder tier I just have a lot of things if I if I opened these you would see

454
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:05,120
how full they all are but it because they're all in storage you don't see them if that makes sense

455
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:12,080
um so yeah is there storage in the tv unfortunately not oops I'm going backwards um but yeah

456
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:19,120
yeah I think that's all that is that's there um we'll go more in depth these are the paintings

457
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:25,120
very nice very nice um I painted this one black it was originally gold but I painted it black it's

458
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:31,120
fake obviously these are some kitty cats I printed this out myself and glued it together in fours

459
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,480
these are more kitty cats this is just some random books this is a um a mirror my mom gave me

460
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:43,200
because she gives me a lot of random shit and she gets offended if I throw them away so I have to

461
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:48,080
keep it for how much stuff you have you have it all stored away very nicely yes only recently

462
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,960
it used to just be sitting out like on the floor only recently I have since been able to get

463
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,800
storage for it honestly your apartment is fine it looks cozy thank you thank you I'm glad you like

464
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:08,080
it um this is like a dragon head that was gifted to me when I was like fucking 14 and I was never

465
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:16,400
able to hang it everywhere because it was broken um so I kept it in my room at home until I moved

466
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:24,000
out and my mom obviously gave it to me because she's like this is yours take it so um it may be

467
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,200
hoarder but it's very well organized hoarding mm-hmm mm-hmm they aren't straight no they're not

468
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:35,200
straight they're not straight at all you're very correct I can't make them straight they're all

469
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:41,840
tilted I'm aware I I'm not at they're not very well secured let's just say that um anyways this

470
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:48,800
is the least well secured one in fact this one's being held up by yarn this one's being hung up by

471
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:59,360
yarn and hot glue so um yeah this is not secure or straight and it's very heavy too but luckily if

472
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,840
it falls it'll just fall on the couch um hopefully no one's on that couch while it falls though

473
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:16,000
mm-hmm yeah and a lot of hope and trust yep um this is my altar um I have more witchcraft stuff

474
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,360
in here more witchcraft stuff in here these are crystals they're all crystals I think this is

475
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:28,080

01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:59,360
bunch of little tiny crystals I think these are flowers and and shells um I have a little book

499
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:08,160
in there that I keep track of spells I have um uh I have another journal where I press flowers in

500
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:14,880
I like to collect flowers during the the summer um my flower jar is somewhere in the back underneath

501
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:23,920
here but yeah uh this is just a calendar for stuff it's really cute and I have like some

no I don't I don't I don't touch grass

504
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:48,000
those metal work or wood on the wall um

505
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:55,760
they're all wood this is wood and this is wood yeah you keep a jar of dead flowers

506
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:02,080
I keep multiple jars of dead flowers well not dead but dried dried dried flowers

507
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:10,960
the only problem with um witchcraft streams is I can't do it here I can't bring my set up here

508
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,760
I'd have to bring all my shit to the bedroom and that's annoying maybe one day I'll get a long

509
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:25,920
enough cord to do a witchcraft stream like right here um why dry flowers

510
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:32,160
shut I don't I don't have I mean I guess I have fresh flowers outside but I prefer dry flowers

511
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:48,480
yeah anyways uh next this is my swider uh cage I guess it's uh it's just a five-gallon tank with

512
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:56,160
like um a mesh top I guess mesh maybe I don't know if mesh is the right word but um

513
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:02,960
um when did you get into witchcraft like two years ago yeah

514
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:11,120
this is for streams no I do this in my I do witchcraft in my spare time too um

515
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,040
there's just a bunch of tiny holes on on the on the top so that she can breathe

516
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:24,400
this is her little water dish there's a bunch of moss and dirt in here and this is her right here

517
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,880
um I believe she is I believe don't I might be wrong

518
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,000
you can't really see her very well but I believe she's a female um

519
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:47,280
oh fuck Arizona blonde I believe I believe she's a female Arizona blonde um when I bought her

520
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:54,560
the like there was the option her name is Rango her name is Rango um when I bought her uh

521
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:02,560
like you have they had the option of like do you want a male baby or a female baby spider

522
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:10,400
um or for even cheaper do you want a mystery gender because I think they're too young at some

523
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:16,880
point like they're too young to uh tell what gender they are and I was like fuck yeah give me

524
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:22,480
a mystery one so I got this one and I think she turned out to be a girl but I'm not entirely sure

525
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:32,560
but I think so um yeah she's very cute she's a little bit skinny um because I thought she was

526
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:36,800
like really really fat but so I didn't feed her as much and then she molted and I was like wait

527
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:42,800
fuck you're actually really skinny sorry males don't live very long males live like 10 years

528
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:49,040
and then females live like 40 so I'm hoping she'll really be with me for a long time she's kind of

529
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:59,200
aggressive um yes she wears little spider makeup and skirts she's a little bit aggressive she um

530
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:07,760
she's about five years old maybe maybe five speaking as a brujo if you do a witchcraft stream

531
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:12,960
you have to be prepared for people joining just to proselytize at you what's proselytize mean

532
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:18,080
I don't know what that word means hold on let me look that up

533
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:26,800
the action of attempting to convert someone from one religion belief or opinion to another oh

534
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:34,000
I mean that's fine it'll probably be a member stream so if you try to do that as a member

535
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:43,200
you're risking your membership yeah I'm not I'm not like the the the I don't know how to explain it

536
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:53,680
I'm not like too insane when it comes to witchcraft like I'm not like oh the spirits are talking to me

537
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:59,520
oh the devil satan satan is leaving me hints in my house that I'm I don't know that I'm

538
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:09,040
spiritually gifted no like I I'm I'm I'm pretty casual about it um there's not really much to

539
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:17,520
convert to like you're you're not gonna be like oh my god Amy's insane she needs Jesus

540
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:26,880
so yeah um yeah hail Santa

541
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:36,480
um yeah it's pretty much it I think she's five years old maybe a little younger maybe like four

542
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:46,640
years old um uh I miss having pet insects but my roommates are prises and won't let me buy any

543
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:53,520
well who cares what's going on Amy thank you for the $1.99 I'm just doing an apartment tour

544
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:59,760
I might have to go pee real quick but nature literally anything really relating to religion

545
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:05,200
sadly live and let it live yeah I don't know I'm not here to convert you and you're not here to

546
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:15,520
convert me so yeah uh yeah this is it she goes in her little hut here they like to burrow so

547
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:21,280
there's probably like a really big hole in here I'm guessing but I don't bother her um she doesn't

548
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:27,520
like to be touched so I don't touch her um I will never do like a tarantula stream where I show you

549
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:33,760
her anything she she will probably bite me or like run away from me and escape under my bed or

550
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:40,160
something so we're not going to touch her but she is very fluffy and she's very cute um so yeah

01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:39,640
It's very dark in here because these are the only two lights in the kitchen that work. Um, the light up here just doesn't work

574
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
So, yeah

01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:50,120
Oven it looks old, right? It looks old

577
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:55,040
What's with the floor? I don't what's with the floor? It's just a floor. I

578
01:15:55,720 --> 01:16:00,240
Didn't I didn't choose anything in this apartment. Yeah, the stove is very very old

579
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:04,760
It came with this apartment. Obviously, I'm not going to purchase a new stove for my landlord

580
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:08,260
So the oven doesn't actually work only these stove tops work

581
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:12,920
And these are just cute little b-bots and bibbits and bobbits

582
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:20,800
Because they're cute. I just got them because they're cute. Some of them I painted myself like they came ugly painted and I painted them myself

583
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,920
Thank you for becoming a member

584
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,160
The floor is made out of floor. Yeah

585
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,360
The oven doesn't work in your landlord has replaced it

586
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:35,200
I don't want to bother him because if he comes inside of my apartment and sees the rats

587
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,200
I don't think he will be happy

588
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:44,640
So I don't bother him and he doesn't bother me. We don't bother each other. He can you know, we don't we don't talk to each other

589
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,280
Yeah

590
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,720
He doesn't need to he doesn't need to come inside. Yes, I need to come inside

591
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:58,320
Yes, we have a very hands-off relationship. I I pay rent on time and he doesn't he doesn't bother me. So yeah

592
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,600
Yeah

593
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,920
So, yeah

594
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:10,520
I know there's some pans in here that are most definitely dirty

595
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,400
Also, this this stays open all the time because it just doesn't close

596
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:18,920
I don't know what happened to it. This is where I keep my garbage and my recycle and also outside, too

597
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,760
This is where I actually put the polar bear

598
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:27,400
I hit it because my mom comes over and I don't want her to be like, oh, this is a new stuffy. What is this?

599
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,400
You know

600
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:34,880
I'm just only your landlord into the your bedroom. He doesn't need to go there to replace. I know but I just I don't want to risk it

601
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,880
Okay, I don't want to risk it

602
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:46,120
Um, I don't know what else is there. This is full of dishes, but you can't actually see them because they're not high enough

603
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:53,360
So, yeah, is it is it like a terrarium only pets apartment?

604
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:58,800
Um, it's like a no pets apartment, but they can't legally enforce that so I'm not gonna be like by the way

605
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,120
I have pets

606
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,840
Because you don't need to know. I'm not even supposed to have an air conditioner

607
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,920
You think I want to say that anything? No. Anyways, um

611
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,720
No, isn't really that bad

612
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:42,840
Where's the milk? It's literally right in here in Canada. We have bagged milk and then there's more milk down here

613
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,920
Or the vegetables are supposed to be

614
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,640
It is messy, I know, okay

615
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:56,480
Is it that bad? Oh my god, I didn't know that the fridge was that bad

This is Caesar salad sauce, this is inshir, this is baby food

622
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:22,200
This is for the rats the inshir and the baby food is for the rats. I think this is a mustard

623
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,480
This is like the loop loop loop things

624
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:28,560
Um, I put them in the fridge because you're supposed to put them in the fridge. I don't know

625
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,560
Um

626
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:39,000

Teriyaki sauce

632
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:58,200
This is some kind of alcohol peach drink that I never finished my mom gave it to me and I never liked it

633
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:03,120
These this same like breakfast lunch and dinner from the previous tenant and I just never removed them

634
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,720
Um

635
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:08,760
You're supposed to use them put them in the fridge if you use them on the face if you yeah

636
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,680
But I have nowhere else to put it so I just leave it there

637
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:17,600
This is one two three bottles of Irish cream

638
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,040
Yeah, lots of condiments I know

639
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:31,960
Half empty cup of gamer subs with only water in it. Um milk water more sauces down here

640
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,840
I'm gonna be honest. I don't know what this can is back here. It's just a lot of

641
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:40,720
I think there's some clementines in here too

642
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:47,200
This is more what we expect. Oh my god, I didn't know my fridge was the worst part. Is it really that bad?

643
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,560
Don't look at the pepper that's been there for like four years

644
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:08,000
This is like cheese, what's it called parmesan? This is more cheese. This is the rice cooker pot and it's filled with rice

645
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,600
What's the clear blue thing in the door?

646
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,640
This this is the this is the face thing. He's the face rollers

647
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,720
No fruits or vegetables actually

648
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:25,040
These are eggs, there's some like cottage cheese back here. That's and I think that's I can't believe it's not better

649
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:30,200
No, those have been back there for like a year at that point probably there's some sesame bread

650
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,800
Up here. Yeah, this is from today. Okay, this is from today. That's not that bad

651
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:42,200
This is from today. Literally. It's not that bad. I literally like literally right before scream

652
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,560
I just put this cup in there because I went to Wendy's today

653
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:49,520
Um, there's some spinach back here with some cheese. I think a

654
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,840
What's it called Chinese?

655
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:57,120
Like those cookies fortune cookies gotta clean that out. I know I do

656
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,280
Right in the fridge is kind of weird. Well, it gets so hot during the summer

657
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:04,420
I feel like the bread is gonna get moldy if I don't put in the fridge

658
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:08,520
You know, is it not gonna get moldy like it gets

659
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:12,080
Like my kitchen goes up to like really really hot

660
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,960
So I put it in the fridge

661
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,840
Why do you have a fortune cookie in there cuz I ordered Chinese food and I didn't finish the fortune cookie

662
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:26,760
Damp is worse for bread than heat. Is it I don't know. I noticed it. It helps

663
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,400
Does help it last longer, okay, there we go

664
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:44,840
Well, doesn't heat cause moisture anyways, um, I got samosas I have vanilla

665
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:50,180
Yogurt, I only like vanilla yogurt. Okay. Um, I

666
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,720
have

667
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,720
I

668
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:59,080
Was I ordered uber eats and I ordered Chick-fil-A and I wanted the Chick-fil-A sauce

669
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,800
But this is the only option they had for Chick-fil-A sauce

670
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:05,000
So I just got a little bottle of Chick-fil-A sauce and honestly, it's really good

671
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,800
My fridge just mostly has sauces. Um, yeah, there's some monster back there. I

672
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:18,800
Think that's pretty much it up here. These are two trays of ice. This is the ice dildo. These are like really old pierogies

673
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,800
This is a

674
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,800
Pepper

675
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
This is ice from the previous

676
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:34,160
Where's your food I'm asking myself the same question

677
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,480
Thank you for the five dollars

678
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:49,440
I mean, I just want to let you know that strong is ready to wrestle with any veeler in every ring

679
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:53,640
Especially you just a fair warning. Oh, I think I could beat strannia. She seems really weak

680
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:05,440
These are breakfast sausages, I think these are more samosas something like that and these are pot stickers

681
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,240
And yeah, that's my fridge

682
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,160
Get the last tenet shit out of there. No

683
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:19,080
I'm lazy. It's just ice like it's literally just ice

684
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,440
There's not much else in here. I think that's about it

685
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,200
Yeah

686
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:32,160
This is hoarder in full view. It's literally just sauces

687
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:37,280
How is it where it's just very like messy, but it's just mostly sauces

688
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,200
There's some like salami up here. I

689
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,720
I

690
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,080
Don't know what to tell you

691
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:53,960
I'm the sauce boss. No, they're not expired. No, I literally just got this new sriracha today. No, so these are not expired. I

692
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,800
Use my sauces. I'm a saucy girl. I use all my sauces

693
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:04,760
Like I'm sorry. I like to dip my food in sauces. I like I like sauces. I

694
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:09,280
Don't know like I use this sauce. I use all of these sauces

695
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:14,400
I don't think there's a single sauce in here that I don't use I use all my sauces

696
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,920
Yeah

697
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:24,560
Sources on what well not specifically on stuff, but like teriyaki sauce you use it for cooking

698
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:28,880
Yeah, I use it for dipping. I use most of these sauces for dipping and also like

699
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,960
Like mixing them in with like noodles

700
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,840
You know

701
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:36,760
Is

702
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:43,240
There a reason why you haven't used the timid size is it a respect thing is it laziness just laziness

703
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:49,400
It's just laziness. It's it's all like stuck together. It's not like an individual race ice pieces

704
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,360
And that's it. Yeah, thanks for listening

705
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:58,440
That's it

706
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,720
I'll move back to the chatting street screen

707
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:07,080
Oh

708
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
You can still see it

709
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:19,720
Yeah, that's it folks, um

710
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:29,960
I mean we'll still chat a little bit, but did you like did you like it? Did you like my room?

711
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,120
I hope you liked it

712
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:40,440
Most of them are good. Wait, so does that mean that some of the sauces are expired eyes

713
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:43,960
Wait, what?

714
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:48,760
Most of them are good. Does that mean some of the sauces? Well, yeah, some stuff is expired, but that's normal like

715
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:55,960
I lived with a mom that does not see expired as expired like she does not see expiry dates

716
01:26:56,440 --> 01:27:01,400
So the fact that you know most of the stuff in my fridge is fine

717
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,040
um

718
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,920
That's that's that's progress. Okay

719
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:14,760
Like and even if the sauces are expired if they still taste good, they still taste good and I'll still use them. Okay. Okay. Thank you

720
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,560
Anyways chat

721
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:29,480
It's normal to keep running food in the in the bin with the food you intend to eat

722
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:35,240
Well, if it's just it's just a sauce sauces can last it's just a sauce

723
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,480
I didn't realize my fridge was the worst thing

724
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:48,680
Don't throw up my sauces. I use my I use my sauces you I'm glad I didn't show you my cupboards. Jesus christ. My cupboards are bad

725
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:57,240
As your big bro, we gotta clean this shit up. I think I read that already

726
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:05,480
Sauce is even when expired aren't really expired the dates on the packages are you aren't really regulated or even enforced by law

727
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,120
It's just a sauce as long as it tastes fine. Then

728
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:10,840
Then why can't I use it?

729
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:15,320
Yeah, leave the girl and her sauces alone

730
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:21,400
I saw nothing wrong with the fridge the freezer on the other hand the freezer was mostly empty

731
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,840
It's just it's just a messy fridge. That's all

732
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,800
And yeah

733
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:35,960
Like I don't I don't know a lot of the food I eat is not really like I don't like I keep it in my cupboards like

734
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:38,760
like tapaki and um

735
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,440
What other stuff do I keep in my cupboards? Um

736
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,200
Like seaweed

737
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,480
And uh noodles

738
01:28:55,800 --> 01:29:00,200
The biology experiment pepper is not fine. It's just it's just a frozen pepper

739
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,920
It's just a frozen pepper

740
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:09,560
Who cares? I'm not gonna eat it. I don't plan on eating the pepper. Okay. I don't plan on eating it

741
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:16,600
Just don't get don't get sick for out of date sauces. I won't if the sauce tastes bad. I won't eat it

742
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,440
Get some penicillin for your sauce

743
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:30,280
Why keep the pepper? I'm lazy. It's just like I don't even

744
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:35,720
I don't see the pepper when I open my freezer. I don't see the pepper. Is that so bad

745
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:39,240
The pepper is not really in my field of vision most of the time

746
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:52,520
Like when I like I don't see the pep it's it's not in my field of vision. I just don't see it

747
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:00,040
Yeah, you're interrogating me about my fridge like I'm so sort of criminal

748
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:03,400
Like I'm going to jail for having some old sauces

749
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:11,320
Are you asian or do you just happen to eat a lot of asian food? I just eat a lot of asian food

750
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:13,560
I like asian food

751
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,560
like um

752
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:18,040
I just eat a lot of asian food and their sauces

753
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,120
Yeah

754
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:28,520
Asian food is probably like my favorite type of food. I was raised by a white mom discovering asian food was like amazing

755
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:30,120
like

756
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:32,600
Discovering asian food for the first time was like wow

757
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:38,440
A whole new door has opened for me and also like I'm a weeb. So of course I like asian food

758
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:50,760
I'm sure most of your fridge isn't even in your field of view. I wear glasses. It's in my field of view

759
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:56,040
Did you ever discover spices as a white girl? Yes, I have spices too

760
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:59,160
in my um

761
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:01,080
Like in my um

762
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:06,280
In my cupboards. I just didn't show you my cupboards and good thing too because you would roast the shadow of me for my cupboards

763
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,840
Because my cupboards have a lot of spices too

764
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:10,840
Oh

765
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:23,240
You can't wait for the wrestling match. I

766
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:28,360
Are we gonna have an actual wrestling wrestling match like maybe after we get

767
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:30,520
3d models

768
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:37,080
I'd totally do a wrestling match with strani after we get 3d models, but I feel like that would look weird

769
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:44,040
I feel like that would look good. No, I'm not showing you the cupboards. You're gonna roast me for my cupboards

770
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:48,920
I literally you I literally like okay. This is where the hoarder part comes out

771
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,800
You know the bts meal

772
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,920
That came out like

773
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Freakin five years ago. I still have my bag in my cup from the bts meal

774
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,160
And also like

775
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,360
Like when I was at the asian grocery store, I found like

776
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:12,520
Like um sailor moon cans

777
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:16,120
soda cans to replace the four-year-old pepper

778
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,720
Thank you. Thank you

779
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:30,040
I found when I was at the asian grocery store one time I found um sailor moon themed soda cans and I I drank the soda and kept the cans in my

780
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:37,160
Cupboard yes, they're washed out. Yes. It doesn't have food in there, but I just kept it and I haven't really

781
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:41,880
Throwed it out. I don't I forget about it. I forget that it's there

782
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:47,720
Sailor moon is acceptable, but bts. I was a bts fan

783
01:32:47,720 --> 01:33:02,440
Seriously, they'll put the bread either in the freezer or out, but if I put it in the freezer then I can't eat it and I don't really have a lot of

784
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:05,160
Like countertop space

785
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:10,920
I don't have open drinks. I have one open drink. I usually don't have open drinks

786
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,520
Sauses are just sauces though

787
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:24,040
She's gonna be streaming a year from now and someone's gonna randomly pop into the stream and ask a it is the is the pepper still there?

788
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:34,360
I guess maybe it might still be there. I don't know. I'm just lazy. I didn't think I'd be roasted for a single bell pepper

789
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,080
and sauces

790
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:41,400
They're just collectibles I eat that

791
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:47,320
I'm just getting roasted now. I really thought people would roast me for how cluttered my place is

792
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:51,560
Or like how it just doesn't really look like it fits together

793
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:55,880
Um, but instead I'm just getting roasted for my sauces and peppers

794
01:33:57,560 --> 01:33:59,560
Thank you for becoming a member

795
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:12,280
A pepper emo no no you cannot remove the pepper it lives there now it's stuck to the freezer now

797
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:48,680
Your place was really cute and cozy. I'm glad you actually liked it. I mean it is old lady, but like

01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:58,280
And I like old lady stuff. It's like cozy. I will not take the pepper with me when I move no

799
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:08,040
Girlie pop outside an old lady inside. Yes

800
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,560
That's me. That's me

801
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:15,640
It's it's home is the trash can

802
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:19,880
Oh the pepper. No, it's home is my is my freezer

803
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:26,600
The pepper will the landlord can take care of the pepper when I leave

804
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:30,680
You should be real proud of it. Thank you. I don't know. I don't

805
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:35,880
Maybe I can show you a picture of how it used to look like. Oh, why do I have dms?

806
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:38,680
done and done, okay

807
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,800
Maybe I can log in I

808
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:45,720
Might be able to show you how it used to look like

809
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:48,120
Perhaps

810
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:49,720
It was bad

811
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:54,120
Hold on. Let me let me see if I can log into another account here

812
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:06,040
No, the pepper does not have a name

813
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,280
Oh

814
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:26,520
Sorry, I'm looking for like a picture. Uh, are you kidding me? I have to scroll. Okay, let me go on my phone

815
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Do you want to name the pepper in my freezer you really want to name it?

816
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:40,040
Oh my god, sure we can we can vote on a name if you want

817
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,600
Oh

818
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:48,760
I think it's in my photo gallery

819
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:59,960
Uh, I should have a picture of it. Hold on. It's probably not going to be great quality because

820
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:04,120
There it is. Hold on. Let me just uh, fuck

821
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:12,440
You can kind of see like oh, but that's too clean. I have to show you a picture from when it was shitty

822
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:18,760
Oh, I have pictures of my first rats in my phone too

823
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:27,720
I didn't take a lot of pictures of it back then because obviously I was like this place kind of looks ugly

824
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Hmm

825
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:44,280
You can see it in a lot of my old streams. I have I still have all of my old shorts that I used to make

826
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,240
saved to my phone whenever I like

827
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:51,480
Did um

828
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:58,120
Like the old streams from like years ago. It's kind of cringe to look back on it. I'm like ill

829
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:02,120
I was hella cringe. I still have like

830
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:07,480
My old prison project audition. That was bad. That was bad

831
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
And pictures of my old fish too

832
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:16,360
She was cute. I don't think I can find it

833
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:27,880
Oh, well

834
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:34,520
You I even have a dance cover that I made for I literally made an entire dance cover for an audition

835
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:36,520
Can you believe that?

836
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:38,680
That's cringe. Oh, let me look at it

837
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:43,160
Oh my god

838
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:48,600
Oh, I literally uh, I learned a whole dance because the um

839
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:56,760
The company was like, oh dancing is a skill we're looking for and I was like

840
01:38:57,560 --> 01:39:00,360
That let me let me learn the dance

841
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,520
And so I learned an entire dance. I learned um

842
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:10,360
Oh my god, I was so cute. I had like bright pink and purple hair. I actually looked really cute

843
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:14,280
I'm not showing it to you though. It's cringe. Um

844
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,000
It was um

845
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Fuck it was

846
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Was was the kpop group

847
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:23,960
And

848
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,400
All that running

849
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:28,680
Sorry

850
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:32,600
Someone sent me that video in marshmallow once and for some reason my my um

851
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:40,520
My browser will not forget about it every time I go to youtube. I learned uh katalena by orange caramel. That's the dance I learned

852
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,200
But it was bad like I'm not a dancer

853
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:50,920
So it was it was bad. Okay, let's just say that it was really bad

854
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,400
It's a catchy song

855
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:03,880
I'm just going through my phone now and trying to find pictures not much

856
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:06,120
Oh

857
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:19,080
Why did it look better before oh because I had the smaller couch

858
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:30,680
Dance for us when you get 3d. No. Oh, it's so bad

859
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,800
Absolutely not

860
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:36,600
I

861
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:39,160
Absolutely not

862
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:44,760
My dancing is not good. I thought I could pull it off just because it's I was like

863
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:51,720
Oh, I've I've danced before not professionally, but I've danced before so maybe I can dance for them, you know

864
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:55,800
If they're looking for dancing then

865
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:58,760
maybe maybe they'll be um

866
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:01,560
Impressed because I

867
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:04,680
You know, I doubt many people put a whole dance cover

868
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:07,720
in their audition

869
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:15,720
Anyways turns out uh, it is now years later. Obviously they rejected me is now years later and that company has um

870
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:20,600
Disbanded they went they went out of business. So

871
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,560
It's a good thing that they didn't grab me actually

872
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:26,600
It's a very good thing that they get they rejected me because they

873
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:29,320
Oh another business

874
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:37,800
And I really can't find like a single picture of my old apartment. I found really cute pictures of me though

875
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:43,400
And also my furry heart

876
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:51,240
Oh well

877
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:57,320
And also my rats I found a lot of cute pictures of my rats

878
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,800
Okay

879
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:01,800
Yeah, they went under it because they didn't have me

880
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:06,520
Disbanded like uh, they ran out they went out of business basically

881
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:14,280
Can we see the furry art no

882
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:19,880
There's something cathartic about seeing businesses that rejected you slash you stopped working for and they went under

883
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:23,080
Oh, it's so

884
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:31,640
Satisfying. Oh, I love to see it. It's happened multiple times now and I love to see it every single time it happens. I'm like

885
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:35,640
Take that

886
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:37,640
That's what you deserve

887
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:40,040
That's what you get

888
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:42,200
So, yeah

889
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,400
It's happened like three times now

890
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:48,440
Which is more than once

891
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:58,840
Don't a thumb go for a dance. I'm not good at it. Like I'm not good at dancing. I'm just I I uh

892
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:02,280
Like I just did it because I was like, ooh

893
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:04,840
They want people who dance and I've danced before

894
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:07,800
You know

895
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:10,360
It's so cathartic. It's so good

896
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:13,160
So satisfying

897
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:19,000
I get it's not revenge. It's not it's not particularly revenge, but it's more like

898
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:22,840
One I dodged a bullet and two like

899
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:33,720
I don't know how to describe it like yeah, that's what you get. I guess

900
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:42,040
Nothing brings me more joy to see them gone after all the lives they've destroyed

901
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:46,600
I mean, they didn't destroy my life my life by rejecting me

902
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:47,640
but

903
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,640
It just feels good because it's like

904
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,440
I know

905
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:55,400
It feels good. Okay, it feels good

906
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:59,720
Yeah, it's their fault

907
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:04,920
Hopefully vealer will stay up forever. Hopefully I don't know

908
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:08,920
I'm kidding. I

909
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:11,080
There's been no

910
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:13,720
No signs that it will go down anytime soon

911
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:18,680
I

912
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:26,040
Looked at my last company just now and found out they went under good good. Were they horrible corpos?

913
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:39,560
I will not slander any company on stream

914
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:45,800
I do not want to get sued by japanese companies that will sue you for saying anything bad about them

915
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:48,520
So

916
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:50,600
No comment

917
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:53,480
Yeah

918
01:44:56,280 --> 01:45:01,240
As long as you and the other girls keep being awesome vealer will be around I hope so I hope so

919
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:07,560
Can you be sued by a company that doesn't exist anymore? Maybe

920
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:13,800
I don't know and I don't want to find out. I don't want to find out

921
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,760
I'm right now

922
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:30,840
Here I'm gonna type um I'm gonna type a text thing

923
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:35,560
Um

924
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:44,680
Um apartment tour is finished. We just chatting now

925
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,520
There

926
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:54,920
So that way when people come into the stream they um they know like

927
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:58,280
I'm I'm I'm done doing the apartment tour. There you go

928
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:04,360
If you're not physically in japan then the japanese company companies threats of lawsuits for defamation are empty

929
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:08,920
I just don't want to tell like

930
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:12,680
Not secrets, but like stuff that isn't known to the public I guess

931
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:20,280
My first job was a money laundering business at least the last year or two it was damn

932
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:31,400
It also reflects badly on you for japanese companies that do exist. That's true. That's true not that I aim to

933
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:34,440
join one, but like

934
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,920
I mean japanese companies already don't like us for the obvious reason

935
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:41,880
Japanese companies hate us

936
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:45,240
Specifically veeler there. They don't like us. Um

937
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:50,200
So yeah, not even like it's not even the towns that hate us. It's just

938
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:53,320
the companies

939
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:56,040
Yes, I'm staying classy

940
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:10,920
Um

941
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:23,080
Not at all enough. Yeah, yeah, yeah, not say so enough

942
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:29,160
Um

943
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:33,800
Corporal say boo to the harlot company

944
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:40,200
They they just I don't I don't know why they um

945
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:50,520
They're not jealous. I think it's just like honestly, I don't know what it is

946
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:57,080
I guess they just don't want their talents to be seen as like

947
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:00,920
Lude or whores because a lot of

948
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:08,680
Japanese v tours in like the corporal sphere you're like supposed to be like really cutesy and pure I think

949
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:11,320
I think

950
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:16,520
Yeah, my oh she doesn't have a vagina

951
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:27,320
How dare you even imply that my oh she has a vagina and gets and gets um

952
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:30,280
I think of another way to say

953
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:36,120
It and gets a little bit corny sometimes. How dare you even imply that?

954
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:39,960
By streaming with of vtubers that are elude

955
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:49,800
And they don't poop either how dare they even make a poop joke. Don't they don't they know that girls don't poop or fart

956
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:54,120
Yeah

957
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:57,080
Yeah, it's it's influenced by the idol industry. So

958
01:48:58,040 --> 01:48:59,240
Yeah

959
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:02,280
That's why it's like that. That's why it's like that

960
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:05,400
um

961
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:11,560
So I understand why they don't want it to just with a 10 foot pole literally I can't even I shouldn't say that

962
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:23,640
How dare you imply my pure idol has thoughts and feelings and bodily functions literally

963
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:28,440
Now I'm just shitting on them. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if you feel that way, but also like

964
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:32,040
That's weird if you do

965
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:39,480
Payment process also pitch a fit if you do anything adult and it can make it hard to survive as a business without their support

966
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:40,840
That's true

967
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:42,040
but um

968
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:44,120
Just collabing with us doesn't do anything

969
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:48,840
For payment processors. I'm just I'm just like ranting that Japanese companies don't like us. That's all

970
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:52,280
That's all

971
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:56,760
I

972
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:05,560
That's how it goes. Yeah, I know

973
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:19,320
Idol culture is really cool, but also sucks at the same time. Yeah

974
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:23,720
I don't know they they do cool stuff like their performances are really cute

975
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:29,720
Like the girl groups are super cute. I like watching them perform in pretty dresses and stuff and act cutesy

976
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:32,440
but um

977
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:37,640
It can be a little bit crazy sometimes it can be a little bit crazy

978
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:42,200
um

979
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:47,320
Collabbing with you equals being aware of the concept of horny content which can make the payment processors angry

980
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:53,240
I think it's more it can make the fans angry than the payment processors

981
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:57,640
Payment processors are like, I don't know mastercard or visa

982
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:00,520
Visa isn't gonna be like, oh, what's that?

983
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:02,760
big company

984
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:04,200
ballo bive

985
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:07,800
Just collabed with vealer. Are you shitting me right now?

986
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:12,280
Cut any cut any any

987
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:17,080
Cut out any services we provide for them right at this moment. They played minecraft together

988
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:19,880
Are you kidding me? They played minecraft together?

989
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:27,240
Drop them drop them and and block their emails and and and block any um

990
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:31,960
Block any phone calls where we're not we're not touching these guys anywhere like

991
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:38,840
I don't I don't think that's it. I think it's it's more just the the the um

992
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:44,360
The like the executives have us of the companies have a stick up their butts

993
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:48,920
And they're worried about the fiend's reaction who also have a stick up their butts

994
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:56,360
No collabs with volvo live, I know

995
01:51:59,560 --> 01:52:02,920
Volvo live, obviously, I don't think we'll collab with volvo

996
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:05,240
volop live

997
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:10,120
I was just using that as an example of a japanese company because it's a really big japanese company

998
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:15,400
But obviously I don't I'm not I'm not expecting that ever but it's just an example

999
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:18,200
That's all

1000
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:22,120
Minecraft is a war crime with us. Of course. It's a war crime

1001
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:26,520
Being in the same stream as us is a war crime

1002
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:31,240
Liking and retweeting our tweets war crime

1003
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:40,360
The moment any of them even like our tweets it's over she's become a whore and she belongs to the streets

1004
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:42,840
And her pussy is loose

1005
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:47,720
Because she liked imv's twitter twitter message

1006
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:53,880
Sorry now now i'm just um exaggerating

1007
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:57,960
But you know what I mean

1008
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:06,920
There's an element of wanting to protect the talents. I think like they worry. Yeah the backlash. Yeah, I know it can

1009
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:09,720
It can impact the creators. Yeah

1010
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:22,840
Contraptions that spawn and kill monsters are pretty war crimey

1011
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:36,120
And you will make a formal apology to us. Yeah, and we will suspend you for two weeks for that

1012
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:39,720
I don't know how common suspensions are anymore

1013
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:45,320
I feel like because people know what the know about them they're not as common

1014
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:48,280
Unless it's like a really big company

1015
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:51,640
I don't know

1016
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:55,640
I guess I wouldn't know I guess I wouldn't know

1017
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:03,720
Can it be an apology with the ukulele? No, you have to be on your knees begging and sobbing and crying and bowing over and over again

1018
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:07,400
They do stealth ones. I know but like

1019
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:12,360
Because people know about stealth ones. I feel like it doesn't happen as often. I don't know

1020
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:19,400
Yeah, like I don't remember the last time I saw someone suspended or like oh guys. I'm going on a

1021
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:24,280
Really last minute vacation for a week. Sorry you guys

1022
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:27,080
you know

1023
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:29,400
um

1024
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:30,520
like

1025
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:32,520
I don't know

1026
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:40,440
Amy suspended until she removes the pepper from the fridge do it

1027
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:47,240
Go tech go sans tronnie and marshmallow right now and tell her to suspend me until I put that until I sent her a picture

1028
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:50,040
Of that pepper in the in the garbage can

1029
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:53,320
Go ahead

1030
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:00,040
Yeah, I have a health break kind of I mean

1031
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:02,680
Yeah

1032
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:08,520
I know health breaks can also just be like I'm tired of dealing with management. So I don't want to stream

1033
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:13,800
Or just I'm tired of dealing with this company. So I don't want to stream. It could either be that or a suspension

1034
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:15,400
um

1035
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:20,040
But I can promise you that any health breaks we have had of healer are not suspensions

1036
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:27,480
Oh, don't test this someone will do that. Go ahead. Just don't be mean to her about it. Be nice to her about it

1037
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:47,560
I don't know what they're called but basically a big tower

1038
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:52,040
Uh

1039
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,200

Cernix gonna open mirrors to get flooded with messages about a random pepper. She's gonna be so confused

1046
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:35,000
She already has members mirrors open. Doesn't she?

1047
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:38,200
I thought she did

1048
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:41,080
I can imagine what you'd call

1049
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:45,320
What you y'all could even do to catch a suspension and fueler without being banned on a platform

1050
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:51,400
Well, our suspensions are us being banned on the platform because we did we the platform hates us

1051
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:54,840
Well, not hates us. We probably did something lewd. Um

1052
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:59,480
Thank you for becoming a member

1053
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:01,640
Um

1054
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:03,320
But no, we don't

1055
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:06,440
Cernix has said over and over that we don't do suspensions

1056
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:09,320
Yeah

1057
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:16,120
We don't we don't do them. So don't worry. The only time I'll be suspended is by youtube because I uh stepped on their toes

1058
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:17,480
Um

1059
01:57:17,480 --> 01:57:24,520
And uploaded something kind of lewd speaking of kind of lewd. Um the newest video. I I wanted to have some sort of

1060
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:29,720
Ear milleming, um

1061
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:37,160
And and uh mimosa did send me audio of her literally like guzzling down on your ears

1062
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:43,800
And I was like, I can't I I can't use it. So

1063
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:47,000
Um, I still wanted to have something

1064
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:51,560
And what I did instead was

1065
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:59,080
Denputt taught me this trick I have these um fidget toys that are little worms

1066
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:05,000
They're like little gelatinous fidget toy worms that you can like stretch and stuff

1067
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:08,440
And I um covered them in lube

1068
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:12,280
And then I rubbed them on the ears

1069
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:21,960
Yeah, I rubbed like squishy lube dub worms on your ears and that's what it was

1070
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:26,680
I feel like it's it's close enough, right?

1071
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:29,800
I feel like it's close enough

1072
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:32,600
Should we not use mim's current name?

1073
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:34,120
I don't but

1074
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:39,720
Sorry, does she not like it when we use that name? I don't know Rune. I say mim's because um

1075
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:42,520
I tagged her as that in the video

1076
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:45,880
But she goes by Rune

1077
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:48,680
Reefling raid, hi reeflings. Hi

1078
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:53,400
Welcome. Um, we already finished our apartment tour. So we're just talking now

1079
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:57,080
But if you want to watch the apartment tour, you can just go back earlier in the stream

1080
01:58:58,440 --> 01:59:00,440
But hello, thank you for coming

1081
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:04,360
Hope it doesn't get banned to me too. I don't think it's that bad

1082
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:13,560
Um, what's the next patreon audio? That's a good question

1083
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:17,640
I don't know

1084
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Maybe I can check

1085
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:25,640
Congrats on 30k little sis love. Thank you, scrawny. Thank you

1086
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:29,080

1087
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:32,600
You

1088
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:46,600
Strawny, what's my next patreon audio? I don't know. They're being updated in like 12 hours. Okay, there you go

1089
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:50,360
Nobody knows yet

1090
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:56,680
Emerus has a bell pepper in her freezer. Oh, you're tattling on me. You're tattling on me

1091
01:59:57,640 --> 01:59:59,640
It's not that bad

1092
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:06,200
Isn't it like flat-chested? I don't know the order. I guess it's flat-chested friction

1093
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:19,560
They're just mad that I have a four-year-old bell pepper in my freezer. That's all

1094
02:00:20,120 --> 02:00:24,600
I'm not I don't play on eating it. I just have it in the freezer and they want me to throw it out and that's all

1095
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:33,800
It's not that bad. They're overreacting. You guys are being dramatic right now

1096
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:39,880
Seatting absolutely seething

1097
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:46,760
Furiously typing on your keyboard right now while your while your fingers are shaking. Let me get rid of the fucking bell pepper

1098
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:56,280
I don't use the last tenant's eyes. It's just there. It's just there. It's just sitting there at the back of my freezer

1099
02:00:56,280 --> 02:00:58,280
I don't use it

1100
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:08,920
Anyways

1101
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:15,320
Now that's stuck in my head what day is it today?

1102
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:24,920

Um

1108
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:54,920
I wouldn't put anything near that thing out of fear. It's just

Oh

1123
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:24,600

1125
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:24,600
Oh

1126
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:54,920

But I I put the I put the pepper in the fridge. I mean in the fridge

1130
02:07:12,360 --> 02:07:14,840
I moved the pepper from the freezer to the fridge. There you go

1131
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:21,240
No, I'm put the pepper in the garbage and I'll take a picture for you

1132
02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:25,480
Oh

1133
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:28,680
This is a chat that you dare to tip for a peek at your chest

1134
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:34,360
What did you think was gonna happen? Don't challenge pin pals. They are a rowdy bunch

1135
02:07:35,320 --> 02:07:37,320
But it's $100 for

1136
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:40,840
for a picture of a pepper in a garbage can like

1137
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:43,640
I don't know

1138
02:07:43,640 --> 02:07:45,640
It's so big. Sorry

1139
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:50,840
Um

1140
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:53,240
There it is

1141
02:07:53,240 --> 02:07:55,240
Here it is

1142
02:07:55,560 --> 02:08:00,520
The most hated fucking pepper in the world there has never been a more hated pepper

1143
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:05,880
Because no one gives a fuck about peppers than this one singular pepper simply because it is old

1144
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:08,360
Simply because it is a hag

1145
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:12,040
This is ageism at its finest and it's in the trash now

1146
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:18,040
You think I I went and just ai generated a pepper in a garbage can

1147
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:20,280
I

1148
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:25,160
Look how she massacred our boy you asked me to put the pepper in the garbage

1149
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:29,400
I won't put it back in the fridge. It belongs in the garbage now

1150
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:32,760
He was so he was so young

1151
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:37,000
Only lived to four years old. He had so much potential

1152
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:39,560
He could have gotten moldy

1153
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:41,560
He could have he could have been planted

1154
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:44,920
In the ground and grown seeds and grown more peppers

1155
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:48,120
But now he's just being sent off to the gulag

1156
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:51,640
To death to be beheaded and then thrown

1157
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:54,040
thrown away

1158
02:08:54,040 --> 02:08:57,320
In a in a was it called trash facility?

1159
02:08:58,760 --> 02:09:01,160
It's not photoshopped. Who do you mean?

1160
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:06,280
It's in the trash. I literally just went in the trash right now

1161
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:10,120
I don't know why you guys don't trust me

1162
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:16,520
I'm not putting it back now. I'm not that disgusting. I'm not my mom

1163
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:21,240
My mom would see this perfectly beautiful pepper in the trash and take it and put it back in the freezer. That's for sure

1164
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:26,200
But I'm not her. I will break the cycle

1165
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
anyways

1166
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:31,720
That's wrong

1167
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:47,160
I'm not I'm not going back to make a video for the pepper in the trash

1168
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:58,440
I'm so sad that you don't trust me that much. Okay. Anyways, moving on. Um, so that's next week scheduled

1169
02:09:58,520 --> 02:10:02,600
Monday wizard one-on-one Wednesday little nightmares Friday amnesia

1170
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:05,640
um Saturday ASMR train

1171
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:08,680
um

1172
02:10:09,320 --> 02:10:11,640
But I want to I want to because you guys all fuck

1173
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:16,120
Hold on. I need to I need to log back into EME on discord

1174
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:23,720
Thank you for the funds for a new pepper. I don't even like peppers that much. That's why I never really ate it

1175
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:27,160
Or is it just kind of meh? I'm okay with them, I guess

1176
02:10:33,560 --> 02:10:35,880
Now the question is do I have the password for

1177
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:39,960
My login

1178
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:42,840
No, I don't

1179
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:46,440
Okay, well, I'm pretty sure we're gonna continue. Um, uh

1180
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:54,200
On that Monday, uh, we're gonna continue. Wait, can I not show everyone else's schedules? Oh, I can oh, I can turn them off

1181
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:58,840
Oh, that's perfect for me. Okay there. So that way I can show you this and um

1182
02:11:01,080 --> 02:11:03,080
Yeah

1183
02:11:04,840 --> 02:11:07,400
Here there we go

1184
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:09,640
I

1185
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:14,040
Can show you

1186
02:11:14,040 --> 02:11:15,080
this

1187
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:21,080
And that way we can make our schedules together and ignore how it says Toronto. That's just the time zone

1188
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:26,040
I don't live in Toronto. Some people will see that and be like, we found Debbie's location

1189
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:28,040
Doxxed

1190
02:11:28,040 --> 02:11:29,880
Doxxed

1191
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:33,160
It's just the time zone chill out. Anyways, um

1192
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:43,720
Yeah, so this is the schedule for next week, but let's do the week after together. So this one, um

1193
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:48,440
It's gonna be at the usual time

1194
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:53,480
But this one we're doing um chain together again

1195
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:57,800
With the

1196
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:00,920
Oh, you can even see what I'm typing

1197
02:12:04,680 --> 02:12:06,680
There we go

1198
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:08,840
Location detected

1199
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:13,240
I can tell you don't live there because you pronounce the second T

1200
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:19,000
Do people don't pronounce it like Toronto. I say Toronto people say Toronto Toronto

1201
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:21,640
Toronto

1202
02:12:25,480 --> 02:12:27,960
Um, let me chain together again with um

1203
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:30,840
Chibi

1204
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:37,400
I think this might be changed, but I think it's it's pretty solid. Um

1205
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:43,080
We're playing it again because we had a fun. I love those girls

1206
02:12:45,240 --> 02:12:52,600
Uh, yep. Anyways, you guys wanted a member stream, right? Can you do a Toronto accent? No

1207
02:12:53,560 --> 02:13:00,600
I don't know how I'm not good at accents in general. They're then British. Oh, let me bring myself on top of this

1208

1221
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:12,360

1222
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:18,600
I wanted to play that because I saw stradis been playing it. I want to play it

And I'll do I'll do the the heartbeat thingy too during it ring fit adventure

1225
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:39,560
I've been wanting to do that

1226
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:45,480
Okay, what else do you want me to do?

1227
02:14:47,720 --> 02:14:52,040
I want to do stuff that you want what is ring fit wise with a strike on your channel

1228
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:56,120
Oh, are they gonna strike me for fucking panting?

1229
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Are they gonna strike me for panting?

1230
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:11,080
I won't be like up in the mic like like I'll be like farther away because I'll be like jumping around

1231
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:16,760
Hmm, okay, it might be an archive then

1232
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Sorry can't risk it

1233
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:25,800
I'll be far away from the mic. I won't be all up in the mic. I'll be standing up further, but

1234
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:30,360
You're still gonna hear me like pants because obviously it's a tiring game

1235
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:44,920
I

1236
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:52,040
Mom, uh, mom it also has a strike and also did it without problem. I know but I don't want to risk it

1237
02:15:53,480 --> 02:15:55,960
Also, does she have a strike? I thought she just had a warning

1238
02:15:58,360 --> 02:15:59,880
I don't know

1239
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:01,880
Maybe she does have a strike. I don't know

1240
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:04,920
I don't want to risk it

1241
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:07,640
I don't want to risk it

1242
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:11,160
She has a warning. I have a strike. She has a warning a strike is worse than a warning

1243
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:15,960
So, yeah, anyways

1244
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:20,040
Um, let's do one more stream. What do you want to do?

1245
02:16:20,920 --> 02:16:23,320
Maybe I could do some sort of hand cam. I have oh

1246
02:16:24,200 --> 02:16:26,040
um

1247
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:28,040
I have in my desk right now. I never built it

1248
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:32,120
I have a nano blocks a nano block. Um

1249
02:16:34,040 --> 02:16:37,160
Thingy of Kirby we can build that together

1250
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:40,680
Do you want that?

1251
02:16:41,640 --> 02:16:43,640
Due to youtube thinking rat breathing

1252
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:52,120
Offering lego it says the original microsoft microsoft microsized building blocks. I don't know. I think it's cute to build together

1253
02:16:53,640 --> 02:16:58,360
I only have one though. Maybe we can build lego's afterwards too if I build it too quickly because I think

1254
02:16:59,320 --> 02:17:01,320
I don't know. It looks kind of simple

1255
02:17:05,640 --> 02:17:07,640
What are nano blocks tism lego's

1256
02:17:08,440 --> 02:17:10,440
They're um, they're just like

1257
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:14,120
Figures figurines here. I can probably show you what I have

1258
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:17,240
I've just had in my desk for a while

1259
02:17:20,280 --> 02:17:22,280
Um Kirby

1260
02:17:28,120 --> 02:17:30,120
Oh, I have to take a screenshot

1261
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:32,120

02:17:35,480 --> 02:17:37,880
Want it oh there we go

1263
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:47,880
Sorry, I had to take a screenshot of the nano blocks

1264
02:17:53,240 --> 02:17:57,560
This is what I have this is what nano blocks are cute right

1265
02:18:00,600 --> 02:18:03,000
It looks really cute. I have some in my room already

1266
02:18:04,840 --> 02:18:07,320
What are your thoughts on playdoh very yummy snack

1267
02:18:11,400 --> 02:18:13,400
Yeah, it's Kirby

1268
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:21,160
So I can build this it's very tiny it's very small but it's cute

1269
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:25,560
Um

1270
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:36,840
And it'll be at the usual stream time

1271
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:46,520
There yay are these good for you

1272
02:18:51,720 --> 02:18:54,680
If you want to avoid getting bonks do naked you'll go you know

1273
02:18:55,240 --> 02:18:57,240
Oh

1274
02:18:57,640 --> 02:18:59,240
Absolutely not

1275
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:02,280
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

1276
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:08,920
Anonymous tipped five dollars. I just wanted to say that we didn't have an rp stream in quite a while

1277
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:14,200
You want a roleplay stream like an asmr roleplay stream?

1278
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:18,760
Hmm

1279
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:24,040
And I'm bad at controlling myself during those I tend to say stuff stuffy stuff and then get banned

1280
02:19:25,640 --> 02:19:27,640
Both my strike and my um

1281
02:19:29,240 --> 02:19:31,240
And my warning were first from streams

1282
02:19:32,040 --> 02:19:34,600
Are you doing a 35k or 40k celebration? No

1283
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:41,400
I um, I'm growing a little too fast. I don't have time to do every single celebration

1284
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:48,040
Um, but I appreciate like people joining and and subscribing and helping me grow, but it's like

1285
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:50,760
I think I should space out the um

1286
02:19:51,720 --> 02:19:58,280
Celebrations a little more, you know, I even asked Manes on like can you stop can you stop posting like um

1287
02:19:59,160 --> 02:20:02,600
congratulation messages for when I reach milestones because um

1288
02:20:03,640 --> 02:20:05,640
It's getting a little bit too often

1289
02:20:07,160 --> 02:20:12,360
And I don't want the vlore twitter to just be like congratulations to me on reaching 50k subscribers

1290
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:15,000
Congratulations to me on reaching 40k subscribers like

1291
02:20:16,120 --> 02:20:18,120
It's enough. Thank you

1292
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Yeah, I'm a grower

1293
02:20:29,880 --> 02:20:36,120
I thought we weren't doing those until I kind of want to like my I think my most two popular streams have been asmr streams

1294
02:20:37,080 --> 02:20:42,520
I don't really want to do five streams in a week. I I like spacing streams out like this. Um, it's like

1295
02:20:43,480 --> 02:20:50,040
The best for my mental health as weak as that sounds, but I'm I'm not strawny and I'm not sheebie

1296
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:57,800
Um, I can't stream every day. It kills me which just sucks because I like spending time with you, but I just I get so

1297
02:20:58,840 --> 02:21:03,080
Like drained it's sad, but I just get drained in general. That's why I don't leave my house

1298
02:21:05,560 --> 02:21:08,760
Literally like going to the grocery store kills me so um

1299
02:21:08,920 --> 02:21:10,920
Um

1300
02:21:11,160 --> 02:21:18,200
One every other day and then here I'll do um the monday after or wait

1301
02:21:21,160 --> 02:21:23,160
Oh, wait, hold on. I might have plans on

1302
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:32,360
I might have plans this day. Hold on. Hold on. I need to check something. I realize I might have plans for that day

1303
02:21:39,480 --> 02:21:41,480
I

1304
02:21:48,360 --> 02:21:51,800
No, we're good. Sorry never mind. That's the wrong weekend

1305
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:55,640
Here we can do um

1306
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:01,160
An asmr stream here and plus I post asmr videos

1307
02:22:01,240 --> 02:22:07,080
So that kind of makes up for the lack of asmr streams, but I don't know what kind of asmr stream would you want?

1308
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:11,560
I

1309
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:23,000
I'm really bad at role playing could it be a brosley stream if you don't want to risk it even if it's just safer work

1310
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:29,800
Brosy streams are even more draining than regular streams if you can

1311
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:35,320
Imagine what is this gaming rats hand cam asmr? What what do you want me to do?

1312
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:42,360
Rats don't listen to me. I can't just like put my rat in front of the camera and like pet its belly for like two hours

1313
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:48,760
Like they're not gonna stay in front of the camera. They that they they they fidget and they run and they move around

1314
02:22:49,480 --> 02:22:51,480
so

1315
02:22:55,880 --> 02:22:58,680
Something lewd we just had the brosley stream

1316
02:23:05,960 --> 02:23:08,760
Training on brosley has a double me

1317
02:23:12,680 --> 02:23:15,800
He can shows me great. You want to do like bj asmr?

1318
02:23:16,440 --> 02:23:22,840
There's there's there is one asmr. I really wanted to make it was like taking a bath with me asmr

1319
02:23:23,320 --> 02:23:25,320
Cuz strani did that too, right?

1320
02:23:27,320 --> 02:23:29,960
Oh, this is so gonna get big but bonked

1321
02:23:30,120 --> 02:23:44,520
No, I'll be say so my other my other bat bathing asmr was cute. It was just like a son of date, but

1322
02:23:53,720 --> 02:23:55,720
I'll so I'll stay I'll I'll be uh

1323
02:23:56,520 --> 02:23:58,520
Control yourself and we don't say anything

1324
02:24:07,160 --> 02:24:09,800
Right there we have a good amount of

1325
02:24:12,680 --> 02:24:14,680
A good amount of streams

1326
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:28,680
Thank you for the three dollars

1327
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:32,840
Please don't strain yourself your mental health health is important as well as your physical as much as I like

1328
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:37,720
To see more in my little sister um who I love very much. I want her to be in the best health

1329
02:24:38,120 --> 02:24:40,360
Proud of you and we'll keep supporting you. Thank you

1330
02:24:41,320 --> 02:24:46,120
I feel bad. I feel like I'm the I sometimes I feel like I'm the one who streams the least in velour

1331
02:24:46,760 --> 02:24:50,520
But I try to make up for it by like posting other content too

1332
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:53,400
um

1333
02:24:54,200 --> 02:24:56,200
But yeah, yeah

1334
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:03,400
We you might be able to but can we be say so knowing you're in a bath

1335
02:25:04,440 --> 02:25:05,800
Probably not

1336
02:25:05,800 --> 02:25:09,800
How about I just turn chat off for that stream because every time I do an asmr stream

1337
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:15,080
People who get like really really lewd and it's like I bounce off of people's energy

1338
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:17,400
So then I start to get lewd and then it's like fuck

1339
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:21,320
I can't I can't do that. I have bonk myself

1340
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:25,800
I

1341
02:25:27,400 --> 02:25:29,400
There's plenty of your content. Okay, good

1342
02:25:39,480 --> 02:25:44,840
Never feel bad about your stamina stamina we understand. Oh, thank you. I'm a quick shot

1343
02:25:45,240 --> 02:25:47,240
You

1344
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:58,600
Work the smartest for sure streaming is for connection and vods are for growing vods are not for growing at all

1345
02:25:59,640 --> 02:26:03,320
Vods can be for growing but they have to be really specific vods

1346
02:26:04,120 --> 02:26:08,600
and um, I don't always want to do asmr vods back to back to back

1347
02:26:09,480 --> 02:26:11,480
so um

1348
02:26:12,440 --> 02:26:18,680
Shorts and videos are for growth for sure. Those are what um lead to the most growth

1349
02:26:22,440 --> 02:26:24,940
Please take time for yourself. You're so nice

1350
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:38,760
Amy I want your like asmr not here but a video or an audio on which the main triggers you're liking

1351
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:41,240
I could probably do that on rosalie

1352
02:26:43,080 --> 02:26:45,080
I could probably

1353
02:27:00,600 --> 02:27:05,800
I wanted to play pickman pickman was another game I wanted to play because I saw strani play pickman

1354
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:07,800
We're playing pickman together

1355
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:11,720
I might have to get it for the Wii U

1356
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:18,200
All of my controllers even the new fucking I hate I hate switches so much for this even my new

1357
02:27:18,920 --> 02:27:21,640
Nintendo switch controllers have janky joy cons

1358
02:27:22,600 --> 02:27:27,480
And I have trouble playing pickman because of that. So I might have to get pickman for the Wii U and play that instead

1359
02:27:28,920 --> 02:27:33,640
But I really like yeah, I own a Wii U. I've had it since like 2014

1360
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:39,480
Maybe not 2014. Maybe like 2016. I've had it for a long time

1361
02:27:43,160 --> 02:27:49,080
But yeah strani raged that pickman. I'll just cry at pickman and also get scared. I'm kind of scared of pickman bosses

1362
02:27:52,920 --> 02:27:54,920
It's a little clunky be warned. I know

1363
02:27:56,280 --> 02:27:59,960
Can use a pro controller. I do use a pro controller and it still fucking sucks

1364
02:28:01,560 --> 02:28:03,560
Yeah

1365
02:28:03,720 --> 02:28:06,200
It me is one of the seven Wii U owners. I am

1366
02:28:07,960 --> 02:28:12,120
But I like Wii U's because I can play Wii U games and Wii games on it, you know

1367
02:28:14,600 --> 02:28:16,600
Get pickman 3 there's no time limit

1368
02:28:18,120 --> 02:28:20,120
We will see

1369
02:28:21,320 --> 02:28:24,680
Anyways on the 25th of september we're playing pickman

1370
02:28:28,360 --> 02:28:30,360
Yeah

1371
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:35,720
Because I always think like oh, I like that game we should play that game together and then I never do it

1372
02:28:37,480 --> 02:28:39,880
And instead I do some random like hand cam stream

1373
02:28:45,160 --> 02:28:48,920
But with the Wii you can play Wii games and gamecube games on it, which is way better

1374
02:28:49,960 --> 02:28:51,960
But I don't play gamecube games

1375
02:28:52,920 --> 02:28:54,920
I have no

1376
02:28:55,720 --> 02:28:57,720
I have no nostalgia for

1377
02:28:58,280 --> 02:29:00,280
Gamecube games

1378
02:29:01,240 --> 02:29:03,240
unfortunately

1379
02:29:04,200 --> 02:29:05,400
um

1380
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:07,880
I have a ds that can play uh

1381
02:29:09,880 --> 02:29:11,880
Gameboy games I think

1382
02:29:22,360 --> 02:29:27,000
You're missing out the gamecube has some real classics. Okay, but they're classics for you

1383
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:30,760
They're classics for you to me. They're not classics

1384
02:29:31,960 --> 02:29:33,800
You know

1385
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:37,800
They're not classics for me because I haven't played them and I don't know about them

1386
02:29:40,840 --> 02:29:44,520
Once they're Nintendo DS stream, oh you want a Nintendo DS stream

1387
02:29:45,880 --> 02:29:48,920
Should I play like some hella niche Nintendo DS games?

1388
02:29:51,640 --> 02:29:53,640
Is that what you want

1389
02:29:53,880 --> 02:29:55,880
We can play um

1390
02:29:58,680 --> 02:30:02,760
The problem is if I play a hella niche a hella niche Nintendo DS game, um

1391
02:30:06,040 --> 02:30:09,240
Then I don't know if I can even emulate them like

1392
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:14,520
Will people have it on an emulator? I don't even know how emulators work to be honest

1393
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
What's a classic for emmy

1394
02:30:19,960 --> 02:30:22,440
Nintendogs do you want to play nintendogs?

1395
02:30:24,440 --> 02:30:27,960
That's not niche. I have more niche ones, but I feel like

1396
02:30:29,480 --> 02:30:31,480
most ds games

1397
02:30:33,160 --> 02:30:35,160
I know I have like fucking

1398
02:30:35,400 --> 02:30:39,320
George of the jungle the ds game. Do you want to play that?

1399
02:30:43,720 --> 02:30:45,960
Like that's what I mean by hella niche

1400
02:30:49,160 --> 02:30:51,160
That's what I have like I have um

1401
02:30:52,760 --> 02:30:54,760
I don't even know

1402
02:30:54,920 --> 02:30:59,160
Like I have random games that don't even have English titles on them

1403
02:31:00,200 --> 02:31:02,200
I don't I

1404
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Let's just say that

1405
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:07,640
No, I'm not gonna tell you where I got them from

1406
02:31:10,760 --> 02:31:12,760
I think I have that game

1407
02:31:13,160 --> 02:31:19,160
I have like what's it called princess and the frog the ds game

1408
02:31:21,640 --> 02:31:23,640
That's what I have

1409
02:31:24,760 --> 02:31:28,520
Okay, we can try I'll try I'll do a stream on the 27th of september

1410
02:31:29,240 --> 02:31:31,240
Where we just play niche

1411
02:31:31,640 --> 02:31:33,640
ds games

1412
02:31:34,120 --> 02:31:35,880
from

1413
02:31:35,880 --> 02:31:37,880
my childhood

1414
02:31:38,440 --> 02:31:40,440
There that's what we'll do

1415
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:44,440
I might have to do a hand cam for that if I can't figure out how to use an emulator

1416
02:31:45,400 --> 02:31:48,040
But we'll play some niche ds games

1417
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:58,040
Amy's family outside of Canada coming in clutch with the pirated games. No, no, they're not pirated

1418
02:31:59,160 --> 02:32:01,160
Like they're they're official

1419
02:32:01,560 --> 02:32:04,120
But I don't know what they're officially for

1420
02:32:05,480 --> 02:32:07,480
If that makes sense

1421
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:13,720
See if they held up over time

1422
02:32:13,720 --> 02:32:18,360
They absolutely did not hold up over time because they were bad in the first place

1423
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:21,240
I have like zuzu pets the ds game

1424
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:26,680
You know

1425
02:32:26,920 --> 02:32:29,240
No, I've never pirated any ds games for real

1426
02:32:30,040 --> 02:32:35,000
My ds's are all 100 not hacked because I was a child and I didn't know how to hack them

1427
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:37,880
You know

1428
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:43,240
I don't know if I can still hack them. Can I I don't know but I'm not going to

1429
02:32:45,320 --> 02:32:47,320
Like I I yeah, I'm not going to

1430
02:32:52,600 --> 02:32:56,600
Because I like them and I don't want to break them. I don't want to break them

1431
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:04,680
If you emulate your pirating. Oh, yeah, I know that but it's I don't know. I feel like it's not bad to pirate Nintendo

1432
02:33:05,400 --> 02:33:07,400
So I don't care

1433
02:33:09,880 --> 02:33:12,440
I don't care I've pirated worse

1434
02:33:14,200 --> 02:33:17,800
Let's just say that I've pirated much worse than Nintendo

1435
02:33:19,480 --> 02:33:23,000
It is morally correct to pirate Nintendo. You should pirate Nintendo

1436
02:33:29,560 --> 02:33:31,560
Especially older Nintendo, yeah

1437
02:33:32,440 --> 02:33:34,600
Like where else am I going to find um

1438
02:33:37,080 --> 02:33:41,320
Hold on I'm trying to think of the the ds game I got

1439
02:33:43,160 --> 02:33:47,560
Or I can't even think of where else are you going to find Guardians of Goho the ds game

1440
02:33:49,400 --> 02:33:55,480
Nowhere you either pirate it or go on ebay and pay like I don't know a hundred dollars for a shitty version of it

1441
02:33:55,480 --> 02:33:57,480
That's fake. I don't know actually

1442
02:33:58,040 --> 02:34:00,040
Is it on ebay?

1443
02:34:01,560 --> 02:34:03,560
It

1444
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:10,840
Is on ebay and you gotta pay 20 dollars for it

1445
02:34:12,840 --> 02:34:16,440
It's actually a really good game and the graphics are actually really good. I'm not gonna lie

1446
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:21,560
First time the graphics are amazing. It's my favorite game. It's my favorite game

1447
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
I've played a lot

1448
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:27,080
um

1449
02:34:27,080 --> 02:34:29,080
Yeah

1450
02:34:30,040 --> 02:34:35,800
If buying isn't owning privacy isn't stealing oh piracy isn't stealing. I mean you you can

1451
02:34:37,400 --> 02:34:43,480
Own the game cartridges in that case you do own it, but yeah, I know what you mean

1452
02:34:46,280 --> 02:34:49,720
Where else am I gonna find hello kitty birthday party

1453
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:54,840
Birthday, I don't know birthday party adventures for the Nintendo DS

1454
02:34:56,120 --> 02:34:58,120
I'm not gonna pay 70 dollars for it

1455
02:34:59,640 --> 02:35:01,640
I have I think

1456
02:35:01,640 --> 02:35:04,760
I've paid a lot for niche hello kitty games. Let's just say that

1457
02:35:07,400 --> 02:35:09,400
Thank you for becoming a member

1458
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:20,840
It means promoting DS graphics. No, but actually it looks good for a d like like let me show you

1459
02:35:22,120 --> 02:35:24,120
This is a little bit like

1460
02:35:24,120 --> 02:35:26,520
No one cares about this other than me

1461
02:35:27,480 --> 02:35:29,480
Like I know no one cares about this

1462
02:35:30,280 --> 02:35:33,720
But for a DS game the graphics are good. Okay

1463
02:35:34,440 --> 02:35:36,920
Let me just show you. Oops. I wrote guardians of the galaxy

1464
02:35:37,960 --> 02:35:42,440
Like no one cares about this movie. It was my favorite fucking movie as a child every time I talked to it

1465
02:35:43,320 --> 02:35:46,120
Talked to it like talked about it to my friends. They were like

1466
02:35:46,760 --> 02:35:49,400
I don't know what you're talking about and I don't care, but to me

1467
02:35:51,080 --> 02:35:53,080
It was my shit, dude

1468
02:35:53,080 --> 02:35:59,480
It was my shit. I loved it. Look at this. Oh, that's for xbox 360. Oh

1469
02:36:00,920 --> 02:36:02,920
There's an I don't have an xbox

1470
02:36:04,200 --> 02:36:06,200
Come on

1471
02:36:06,600 --> 02:36:09,320
Oh, that's why it looks so good because it's for xbox 360

1472
02:36:12,040 --> 02:36:14,040
Um

1473
02:36:14,280 --> 02:36:16,120
This looks like the

1474
02:36:16,120 --> 02:36:18,120
Nintendo Wii video

1475
02:36:19,240 --> 02:36:21,240
I'm looking for the DS version

1476
02:36:23,160 --> 02:36:25,160
Listen, all I remember is that it looked good

1477
02:36:26,040 --> 02:36:28,040
This looks like the DS version

1478
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:29,800
Here

1479
02:36:29,800 --> 02:36:32,600
It's a shitty screenshot because you don't see much, but I'm telling you

1480
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:35,400
I'm telling you right now

1481
02:36:37,240 --> 02:36:38,280
Look

1482
02:36:38,280 --> 02:36:45,800
This is good for a DS game. Obviously. It's blurry before a DS game. Okay. This is good. This is good

1483
02:36:46,360 --> 02:36:51,480
Look at that. That's amazing. That's amazing for DS. They really did a lot

1484
02:36:54,040 --> 02:37:01,240
Anyways, um, I love the owl movie. I'm glad I have more owl autists in chat

1485
02:37:05,400 --> 02:37:09,560
Right, right. What are we looking at a screenshot from the DS game?

1486
02:37:11,640 --> 02:37:14,840
For DS, this is good and I don't know how they even managed to do this

1487
02:37:15,720 --> 02:37:17,720
But for DS, it looks good

1488
02:37:18,120 --> 02:37:20,120
Because a lot of DS games looks like shit

1489
02:37:21,080 --> 02:37:25,400
I know I know I know not many people care about it, but I care

1490
02:37:29,240 --> 02:37:35,480
I wanted more album war movies. I wanted more movies too. I started reading the book as an adult then I got bored

1491
02:37:37,400 --> 02:37:40,200
But I really liked the movie. It was so good

1492
02:37:40,760 --> 02:37:46,920
And even the movie even the graphics of the movie are like really really beautiful too. I think they're beautiful

1493
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:49,240
I don't know

1494
02:37:49,240 --> 02:37:51,240
Is my favorite movie

1495
02:37:52,600 --> 02:37:57,400
Um, I have not played marvel's rise of the imperfects. No

1496
02:37:59,160 --> 02:38:01,160
Book series was great. I'm sure it was

1497
02:38:04,840 --> 02:38:07,720
Do we read the books or watch the movie? There's only one movie. Um

1498
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:12,760
I would recommend probably reading the books and then watching the movie

1499
02:38:12,760 --> 02:38:18,120
But the book obviously it's a movie so it cuts out a lot of stuff from the book

1500
02:38:19,240 --> 02:38:22,200
Um, but they're both really good

1501
02:38:25,800 --> 02:38:30,600
We had owls of gujul and rango relatively close to each other. It feels like we got no movies like that anymore trill

1502
02:38:32,440 --> 02:38:33,880
Yeah

1503
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:36,440
Imagine if they made movies of the warriors books

1504
02:38:37,160 --> 02:38:39,560
That would have been really popular actually

1505
02:38:40,520 --> 02:38:42,520
I don't know why they didn't

1506
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:45,160
Warriors was really really popular

1507
02:38:45,160 --> 02:38:52,120
Why did they never make a uh a warriors book?

1508
02:38:55,240 --> 02:38:59,000
I would have I would have ate that shit up. You know what I was really excited for

1509
02:38:59,640 --> 02:39:01,640
Once again a book that no one knows about

1510
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:08,040
But my favorite book series as a child. I didn't read no harry poa. I didn't read no pussie jackson

1511
02:39:08,200 --> 02:39:12,200
You know what I read? I found a random dragon book in the um

1512
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:16,760
Library of my school when I was in like

1513
02:39:19,080 --> 02:39:23,080
Sixth grade and ever since then I've been obsessed with the book series

1514
02:39:23,320 --> 02:39:27,160
And I've wanted a movie or show made out of it and it was um

1515
02:39:29,800 --> 02:39:33,240
It was wings of fire that was my favorite series

1516
02:39:34,360 --> 02:39:36,360
No, it wasn't aragon. It was wings of fire

1517
02:39:37,720 --> 02:39:39,560
um

1518
02:39:39,640 --> 02:39:43,720
I I don't think there's been more but like I've been um

1519
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:46,600
What's it called

1520
02:39:46,600 --> 02:39:50,520
Like in in phases I would go in and out of phases of keeping up with the book series

1521
02:39:50,840 --> 02:39:57,720
I'm not sure if it had if it ended yet, but if it did end it's like recently ended and it's been going on for a really long time

1522
02:39:58,680 --> 02:40:00,680
um

1523
02:40:03,560 --> 02:40:08,520
It was good I couldn't remember the name of that I couldn't remember the name of that for nothing. Yeah

1524
02:40:09,800 --> 02:40:11,000
I

1525
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Loved it. It was my favorite book series

1526
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:16,680
And I I so wanted them to have a movie

1527
02:40:17,320 --> 02:40:21,400
I was I needed the movie so bad, but I don't I think it's done

1528
02:40:22,360 --> 02:40:24,600
I think it's done. Let me just see

1529
02:40:27,480 --> 02:40:30,440
Come on, there's 15 books

1530
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Is there gonna be a book 16?

1531
02:40:36,200 --> 02:40:38,200
Wait, what?

1532
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:44,040
Hey, there's a book 16. Wait, hold on. I'm confused. Why does it only show 15 books on the website?

1533
02:40:46,360 --> 02:40:51,400
How many is there gonna be new books? I've only read up to the b1

1534
02:40:52,840 --> 02:40:54,840
I've only read up to the b1. Um

1535
02:40:56,520 --> 02:40:58,520
The hive queen that's what I've read up to

1536
02:41:01,880 --> 02:41:04,200
And I started poison jungle, but I didn't finish it

1537
02:41:04,760 --> 02:41:06,760
I

1538
02:41:07,080 --> 02:41:11,560
Didn't Netflix announced an adaptation for that like last year. It was years ago and it got canceled

1539
02:41:12,280 --> 02:41:17,800
And I was so mad. I was I was freaking out. I was going crazy. I was crying tears of joy

1540
02:41:17,800 --> 02:41:22,760
I was like finally finally we get a crumb of something cool and then they canceled it

1541
02:41:24,680 --> 02:41:30,520
They canceled it which is fine because I'm guessing they would have censored it for the show

1542
02:41:31,480 --> 02:41:37,560
That book was a little bit strange in the sense where it was it seemed like it was marketed to children

1543
02:41:38,600 --> 02:41:44,040
Um, it seemed like it was marketed to children. But for some reason there was like really gory scenes

1544
02:41:45,240 --> 02:41:46,520
in that book

1545
02:41:46,520 --> 02:41:50,120
That were like kind of too gory for children

1546
02:41:51,160 --> 02:41:53,160
um

1547
02:41:53,400 --> 02:41:57,560
So it wasn't woke enough is my guess the series is very woke actually

1548
02:41:58,520 --> 02:42:02,600
The series is pretty woke. There's like gay dragons

1549
02:42:04,760 --> 02:42:06,760
There's gay dragons. It's very woke

1550
02:42:08,840 --> 02:42:10,840
Which is sweaty

1551
02:42:11,480 --> 02:42:13,480
But yeah

1552
02:42:13,880 --> 02:42:19,160
Um, the last one I read was the ice dragon queens if I'm ice dragon queens

1553
02:42:20,840 --> 02:42:22,840
Are you talking about winter training?

1554
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:33,400
My favorite was definitely unwind. I've never heard of unwind

1555
02:42:41,720 --> 02:42:43,720
Gay dragons you say

1556
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:50,760
Oh the kids that's not for the kids don't show the kids the gay dragons

1557
02:42:51,640 --> 02:42:56,040
They're gonna hate it. Wasn't there like throw slitting and dismemberment in those? Yeah

1558
02:42:57,560 --> 02:43:00,680
Yeah, that's why I like them. I thought it was cool

1559
02:43:01,640 --> 02:43:03,640
I had a huge crush on

1560
02:43:03,640 --> 02:43:05,640
Hold on. Let me just make sure I'm saying his name, right?

1561
02:43:06,680 --> 02:43:08,680
No

1562
02:43:13,160 --> 02:43:19,160
I forgot his name. I can't believe I forgot the name of my biggest crush that dark stalker dark stalker is like one of the

1563
02:43:21,640 --> 02:43:26,920
One of the antagonists in the books and I was I that was my childhood crush

1564
02:43:28,520 --> 02:43:31,000
I was I didn't care about like any of the

1565
02:43:32,360 --> 02:43:38,120
I didn't care about any celebrities or cartoon characters. I had a crush on a on a book dragon

1566
02:43:40,520 --> 02:43:42,520
I thought it was so hot

1567
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:46,680
Are these dragons bad? Oh, they're very bad

1568
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:49,960
These are very very bad dragons

1569
02:43:50,840 --> 02:43:54,360
They're even in the bad dragon catalog. You should go check it out

1570
02:43:54,920 --> 02:43:57,720
Sounds like a childhood crush name

1571
02:43:58,920 --> 02:44:02,760
Listen, they had really cringe names like all the dragons had like

1572
02:44:03,880 --> 02:44:06,920
Warrior cats level cringe names, you know

1573
02:44:07,880 --> 02:44:11,960
So, yeah, it's a cringe name, but he was my favorite

1574
02:44:14,600 --> 02:44:18,440
Why are all your favorites called edgy stuff like dark stalker twilight of this? I don't know

1575
02:44:20,520 --> 02:44:24,280
I don't know. I don't know my second favorite was just called sunny though

1576
02:44:25,320 --> 02:44:27,320
So it's not that crazy

1577
02:44:31,800 --> 02:44:34,360
You're so real for that. I mean, thank you. Thank you

1578
02:44:38,440 --> 02:44:40,440
Chuny maxing wait

1579
02:44:48,840 --> 02:44:50,840
Oh

1580
02:44:51,800 --> 02:44:54,840
The witch girl is edgy imagine it's not really edgy to like him

1581
02:45:01,800 --> 02:45:05,000
Edge chronicles no, I didn't read a lot of series growing up

1582
02:45:06,440 --> 02:45:09,640
I didn't watch some movie called chronicles something

1583
02:45:11,240 --> 02:45:13,480
No, I didn't read edge chronicles

1584
02:45:14,840 --> 02:45:16,840
But I did watch

1585
02:45:18,680 --> 02:45:20,680
What did I watch

1586
02:45:21,720 --> 02:45:23,720
I

1587
02:45:24,120 --> 02:45:28,600
Watched the movie spider wick chronicles. I thought that was good. I enjoyed that movie

1588
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:33,800
I was really really scared of like the goblins in that movie that was terrifying

1589
02:45:35,160 --> 02:45:39,080
I watched I watched spider wick. I actually never watched chronicles of narnia. No

1590
02:45:44,200 --> 02:45:45,880
Nope

1591
02:45:45,880 --> 02:45:48,040
Yeah, I was terrified of spider wick chronicles

1592
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,800
Ew looking back at pictures of that movie. It's so ugly

1593
02:45:52,840 --> 02:45:54,840
another one I watched was um

1594
02:45:58,280 --> 02:46:01,960
What was it called this one's really old I think some of you will remember this because you're old

1595
02:46:02,920 --> 02:46:04,920
Oh, let me try to remember it

1596
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:08,120
Every time every time I try to remember it was like about a boat

1597
02:46:09,640 --> 02:46:13,800
Not about a boat, but it one of the main plot lines was about a boat

1598
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:16,600
um

1599
02:46:16,600 --> 02:46:18,840
It was like a magical boat, maybe

1600
02:46:20,040 --> 02:46:24,200
Can you recommend old movies about a boat that had a boat in it?

1601
02:46:26,200 --> 02:46:30,680
And I watched it as a kid. No, it was like a huge boat like a pirate boat

1602
02:46:31,960 --> 02:46:33,560
um

1603
02:46:33,560 --> 02:46:36,200
No, not life of pie. I'm not that young

1604
02:46:37,080 --> 02:46:43,000
No, not tight. Come on guys. It was like a it was like a mystical magical boat and had fairy creatures

1605
02:46:43,560 --> 02:46:45,560
in it and I had like

1606
02:46:45,960 --> 02:46:47,160
um

1607
02:46:47,160 --> 02:46:49,160
No, not come on

1608
02:46:49,320 --> 02:46:52,200
It's a niche. It's a niche one. It's a niche one. Um

1609
02:46:53,800 --> 02:46:56,440
Peter Pan. Oh my god. Look. No, it's a really

1610
02:46:57,160 --> 02:46:59,000
Noah's Ark

1611
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:02,120
Junie to Atlantis. No, it wasn't animated. Is that one animated?

1612
02:47:05,880 --> 02:47:07,880
What is that?

1613
02:47:08,520 --> 02:47:11,480
No, no, no, it wasn't animated. It was live action. Um

1614
02:47:12,440 --> 02:47:16,280
Come on. It's not Gulliver's Travels. Um

1615
02:47:24,520 --> 02:47:30,920
One time I literally typed in the description and not Pirates of the Caribbean, not the Odyssey. No

1616
02:47:34,600 --> 02:47:36,600
If I had to explain it, it was like

1617
02:47:37,560 --> 02:47:41,640
From what I remember it was a story about a dad and two daughters

1618
02:47:43,160 --> 02:47:45,640
And I think one day like

1619
02:47:46,600 --> 02:47:50,600
One night their home got like raided by like ugly fucking

1620
02:47:51,400 --> 02:47:52,680
big-ass like

1621
02:47:52,680 --> 02:47:54,680
goblin guys

1622
02:47:54,680 --> 02:47:57,800
I don't know what to describe them. They're really ugly and um

1623
02:47:59,960 --> 02:48:03,160
I don't know what they did. Maybe they kidnapped one of the daughters or something

1624
02:48:03,800 --> 02:48:04,920
and brought

1625
02:48:04,920 --> 02:48:09,720
Brought her like, I don't know what they did or maybe they kidnapped their mom. I don't know

1626
02:48:10,440 --> 02:48:15,960
But they got on some boat and there was a Minotaur guy on the boat too. I think he was really ugly too

1627
02:48:16,120 --> 02:48:18,120
Was it NSFW? No

1628
02:48:18,120 --> 02:48:20,120
It was a children's movie. Um

1629
02:48:21,800 --> 02:48:23,800
And um

1630
02:48:24,760 --> 02:48:26,760
Gilligan's Island, no

1631
02:48:27,880 --> 02:48:29,880
Man now I need to know

1632
02:48:33,160 --> 02:48:40,600
No, it wasn't Gilligan's Island. It was like really mystical and magical. Um, and there was one scene where like they found a

1633
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:44,840
They found like a desert and there was like a

1634
02:48:45,960 --> 02:48:51,720
There was like an underground maze in the desert. It was not Percy Jackson. Oh my god voyage of the unicorn. I think that might be it

1635
02:48:55,320 --> 02:48:57,320
It was voyage of the unicorn

1636
02:48:57,560 --> 02:49:01,320
That's what it was. I watched that. Oh my god

1637
02:49:02,200 --> 02:49:05,800
That scared the shit out of me. Is it a show?

1638
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:10,280
Two hours and 15 minutes

1639
02:49:10,600 --> 02:49:12,360
This isn't a show

1640
02:49:12,360 --> 02:49:16,200
So I got it. Yeah, we found it was a monsters ink. Oh my god

1641
02:49:17,720 --> 02:49:21,000
Thank you. Thank you made for tv movie. It's

1642
02:49:22,680 --> 02:49:26,600
We should watch voyage of the unicorn together. It's crazy. It's whack

1643
02:49:27,240 --> 02:49:31,240
It's scary. It's weird, but I really like it. I really liked it as a kid

1644
02:49:31,960 --> 02:49:37,720
I thought the fairies were super super pretty and beautiful like the costuming for that movie is really really pretty

1645
02:49:39,560 --> 02:49:44,360
I googled children's movie with a boat and minotaur and voyage of the unicorn show came up. Yeah

1646
02:49:44,680 --> 02:49:48,440
Yeah, that's probably what I googled before too, but I I couldn't quite get it

1647
02:49:48,520 --> 02:49:51,800
But yeah, that's what I watched as no one here watched it

1648
02:49:52,760 --> 02:49:54,760
seriously

1649
02:49:54,760 --> 02:49:56,920
How many people how many people in chat have watched it?

1650
02:49:58,600 --> 02:50:00,600
Is it Canadian? I have no clue

1651
02:50:01,720 --> 02:50:06,200
Nope. Nope. Nope. Never. No. No

1652
02:50:09,480 --> 02:50:12,040
Holy crap, not a single person in chat has watched it

1653
02:50:14,360 --> 02:50:17,800
I might have seen that when I was a kid. Yeah, when when was it from?

1654
02:50:19,160 --> 02:50:21,160
It's only from 2001

1655
02:50:21,880 --> 02:50:23,880
Never heard of it. Holy crap. Okay

1656
02:50:24,440 --> 02:50:29,960
Okay, we'll watch voyage of the unicorn together. We'll watch voyage of the unicorn together

1657
02:50:30,920 --> 02:50:34,520
Let me put that on the schedule. I got it. I got to introduce you to it

1658
02:50:35,080 --> 02:50:38,600
It may be the old one. No, no, I didn't watch it in 2001

1659
02:50:39,560 --> 02:50:41,560
No

1660
02:50:43,160 --> 02:50:48,840
The one watch along I do is for of some niche movie that no one even knows about

1661
02:50:49,800 --> 02:50:51,000
I

1662
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:58,280
Was a really manly man couldn't watch no unicorn movie. It wasn't really a like it wasn't a girly movie in the slightest

1663
02:50:58,360 --> 02:51:01,240
It's just called voyage of the unicorn. It was um

1664
02:51:02,840 --> 02:51:04,680
It was a pretty like

1665
02:51:04,680 --> 02:51:08,680
I don't know if it was children friendly, but like it was it was not a girly movie in the slightest

1666
02:51:09,320 --> 02:51:11,320
um, it had a lot of cool

1667
02:51:12,680 --> 02:51:14,680
You know cool epic scenes

1668
02:51:15,800 --> 02:51:17,800
And like fighting scenes and stuff

1669
02:51:19,320 --> 02:51:21,320
Amy voyage

1670
02:51:23,080 --> 02:51:25,080
Oh, shit, I don't have a member stream

1671
02:51:26,600 --> 02:51:28,600
For that week

1672
02:51:29,800 --> 02:51:33,400
Okay, what do you want to be the member stream the asmr

1673
02:51:33,960 --> 02:51:38,280
The pikmin the niche ds games or voyage of the unicorn because I want to do one

1674
02:51:39,880 --> 02:51:41,880
I want to do one member stream a week

1675
02:51:42,920 --> 02:51:45,880
Which one do you want to be the members asmr?

1676
02:51:49,400 --> 02:51:55,160
Your little sister force you to watch your favorite childhood movies. It's not gonna feel like a childhood movie because it's an old movie

1677
02:51:57,080 --> 02:52:02,840
Asmr asmr asmr. Okay. I'm mostly seeing asmr. So asmr will be the member stream the bathing

1678
02:52:03,960 --> 02:52:05,960
um

1679
02:52:09,800 --> 02:52:12,520
I just feel like watch alongs aren't really members

1680
02:52:13,160 --> 02:52:18,360
Like unless you specifically want it, I feel like I usually wouldn't do a watch along for a member stream, you know

1681
02:52:19,080 --> 02:52:23,000
Voyage of the unicorn is free to watch on youtube. Hey, that's perfect. That's perfect

1682
02:52:25,080 --> 02:52:27,080
So members only will be the

1683
02:52:27,080 --> 02:52:33,000
Beating with your little sister asmr. I might um, it's very it's very highly likely that I make that into an actual video as well

1684
02:52:33,560 --> 02:52:38,200
But that will probably be like scripted and have like some triggers in it. Maybe so

1685
02:52:39,240 --> 02:52:42,440
But as a stream we'll make that one members only

1686
02:52:44,520 --> 02:52:46,520
And then on the 29th

1687
02:52:47,240 --> 02:52:52,280
Plating three weeks ahead we'll do a voyage of the unicorn watch along

1688
02:52:55,880 --> 02:52:57,880
Free with ads got installed at ad blocker

02:53:12,280 --> 02:53:15,800
Really really extreme for me to install an ad blocker

1693
02:53:17,240 --> 02:53:19,240
Okay

1694
02:53:20,040 --> 02:53:22,040
Voyage of the unicorn

1695
02:53:22,680 --> 02:53:24,680
Watch along

1696
02:53:39,720 --> 02:53:44,440
Anyways, um, do you want to have a fansly stream one of these two? I mean brosly

1697
02:53:45,320 --> 02:53:52,280
Bros, do you do what? What are those two one of these days? Maybe at the end of the month near near the end of the month more

1698
02:53:54,280 --> 02:53:55,960

I'm gonna plan it in september because I do want to I do want to go somewhere one of these days

1700
02:54:03,080 --> 02:54:05,080
If you're up for it

1701
02:54:15,240 --> 02:54:17,240
Um

1702
02:54:21,400 --> 02:54:24,280
Should I put it on the calendar or should we just choose a day?

1703
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:28,680
I'll just like tweet out a day and like you can remind me and maro's okay

1704
02:54:29,800 --> 02:54:34,360
Remind me and maro's because oh wow, uh tits on twitter. Holy crap. Oh shit

1705
02:54:35,560 --> 02:54:38,840
Oh, shit. I'm not logged into my home. I'm not like to my NSFW account

1706
02:54:39,800 --> 02:54:41,800
Oh

1707
02:54:41,960 --> 02:54:45,720
I just got a I just got a little bit of an update for the

1708
02:54:46,440 --> 02:54:50,440
For one side of the body pillow. Would you like to see it?

1709
02:54:51,240 --> 02:54:53,240
Would you like to see the updated image?

1710
02:54:57,800 --> 02:55:02,520
Well, I have to take a screenshot of it again. It's only one side. I'm gonna have two sides

1711
02:55:03,400 --> 02:55:06,920
I'll show you a little photo of

1712
02:55:08,920 --> 02:55:10,920
Of the body pillow

1713
02:55:11,480 --> 02:55:13,480
I don't know when it'll be done, but

1714
02:55:14,040 --> 02:55:20,280
The artist seems to be making progress, which I appreciate because I'm I'm bad as an artist and I don't make a lot of progress on comms

1715
02:55:20,520 --> 02:55:24,680
That's why I don't make a that's why I don't have a lot of comms because I don't make progress on them

1716
02:55:25,560 --> 02:55:27,560
Here's the thighs

1717
02:55:27,640 --> 02:55:29,640
Eyes

1718
02:55:31,160 --> 02:55:35,560
Will I have an NSFW side? Yes, this is the safer work side though

1719
02:55:48,200 --> 02:55:54,040
Um, what was I gonna do? Oh, yeah, I was gonna tweet out a date for brosley now

1720
02:55:54,040 --> 02:55:56,040
Now

1721
02:55:56,360 --> 02:55:58,360
Would you prefer

1722
02:56:00,360 --> 02:56:02,360
Would you prefer um

1723
02:56:06,360 --> 02:56:08,360
A weekday or a weekend

1724
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:15,400
I'm just like scheduling things with you now. I'm just working with you. You're helping me do my job right now

1725
02:56:18,280 --> 02:56:20,840
I mean it's helpful because sometimes I don't know what to do on stream

1726
02:56:20,840 --> 02:56:22,840
Um

1727
02:56:23,640 --> 02:56:29,320
A weekend weekend weekday weekend weekend weekend weekend weekend weekend, okay

1728
02:56:30,760 --> 02:56:34,600
Uh, will it be later at night again? It really depends on the day

1729
02:56:35,720 --> 02:56:41,800
Um, if it's a hot day, then it'll have to be moved to later at night if it's not a hot day, then no

1730
02:56:43,720 --> 02:56:46,360
Either is fine. Want to pull it? Okay, I'll pull it

1731
02:56:47,080 --> 02:56:49,080
We'll pull it

1732
02:56:49,400 --> 02:56:51,400
Thanks for helping me do my job

1733
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
I'll start a poll

1734
02:56:59,720 --> 02:57:02,440
What type of day

1735
02:57:03,800 --> 02:57:06,120
Wait, hold on. Maybe I can weekday

1736
02:57:07,640 --> 02:57:09,640
I'll write like Saturdays

1737
02:57:10,680 --> 02:57:12,680
Saturday like a Saturday

1738
02:57:13,480 --> 02:57:15,880
a Saturday a sunday

1739
02:57:20,040 --> 02:57:24,120
There's your poll shoes shoes wisely

1740
02:57:34,280 --> 02:57:39,800
Friday's cool too. Okay. Okay. Okay. I should have added Friday as an option then

1741
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,480
I can't okay. It seems like Saturday's winning

1742
02:57:46,440 --> 02:57:48,440
We'll do it on a Saturday then

1743
02:57:49,560 --> 02:57:55,000
You make it a members only poll as a non-member. I shouldn't have a say in that compared to your regulars

1744
02:57:55,480 --> 02:57:57,480
But it's gonna be a public stream

1745
02:57:58,040 --> 02:58:00,040
So it doesn't matter

1746
02:58:00,040 --> 02:58:02,040
You can be there

1747
02:58:04,200 --> 02:58:06,680
So yeah, we can be there

1748
02:58:07,560 --> 02:58:11,480
It won't be something crazy. Oh wait. We actually know it's not gonna be a public stream

1749
02:58:12,360 --> 02:58:14,360
Oh, it's gonna be members. Oh

1750
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:16,200
Sorry, sorry

1751
02:58:16,200 --> 02:58:20,040
You're right. I don't think I can make a poll members only unfortunately though. No

1752
02:58:20,920 --> 02:58:26,600
I cannot make a poll members only for my what I can tell you're right. Sorry. I forgot. It's not gonna be it's not gonna be free

1753
02:58:27,560 --> 02:58:29,560
regard, um

1754
02:58:30,120 --> 02:58:34,200
Okay, well Saturdays probably makes sense. So let's do it

1755
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:36,200
Let's do

1756
02:58:49,480 --> 02:58:51,640
Do one more won't fall. No, it's okay

1757
02:58:53,160 --> 02:58:55,560
It's okay. It's okay. Strani has

1758
02:58:56,280 --> 02:58:58,280
Was it in a members only stream?

1759
02:58:58,680 --> 02:59:00,760
Because I don't know how to do a members only poll

1760
02:59:04,760 --> 02:59:06,760
Uh

1761
02:59:09,560 --> 02:59:13,400
Let's do it on the 14th Saturday the 14th. How about that?

1762
02:59:16,200 --> 02:59:21,480
I'm just gonna tweet it out. Okay, and you remember you remember for me. Okay. Okay. Thank you

1763
02:59:24,360 --> 02:59:31,160
Today's the sixth holy shit today's the sixth today's already the sixth

1764
02:59:35,160 --> 02:59:38,760
How could I forget? Yeah next week

1765
02:59:51,800 --> 02:59:53,800
Okay, I'm gonna tweet though

1766
02:59:54,280 --> 02:59:56,280
So it's gonna be members only

1767
02:59:57,000 --> 03:00:00,920
Or subscribers I guess on brosley is that what it's called subscribers

1768
03:00:01,880 --> 03:00:04,840
Subscribers I can't even oh there it is

1769
03:00:10,440 --> 03:00:13,320
Yeah subscribers, that's what it's called

1770
03:00:15,320 --> 03:00:18,280
Yeah, I'll call it members only

1771
03:00:22,200 --> 03:00:24,200
On

1772
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:30,520
The 14th it's gonna be you know what let's make it let's make it late again because I stream I stream already on that day

1773
03:00:31,880 --> 03:00:35,960
Um, so we'll make it at the same time as last time. Is that okay? I already stream on that day

1774
03:00:36,760 --> 03:00:39,160
So you'll have two streams in one day, you know

1775
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
Subscriblers

1776
03:00:43,960 --> 03:00:47,160
The members tab has a locked poll function the members tab

1777
03:00:53,800 --> 03:00:56,600
On the members tab on youtube that's like the community tab, right?

1778
03:01:01,880 --> 03:01:03,880
Okay

1779
03:01:20,920 --> 03:01:22,920
Sorry, I'm tweeting it out

1780
03:01:26,920 --> 03:01:28,920

Yeah, you can catch the vlog too

1783
03:01:38,680 --> 03:01:44,520
You don't have enough grace versus members who just screwed the poll so just do Saturday. Yes 14th is Saturday. Yeah

1784
03:01:50,120 --> 03:01:55,160

1796
03:02:51,640 --> 03:02:53,080
Yay

1797
03:02:53,080 --> 03:02:58,520

I am picking you up and plopping you down in a zero stream. That's all I mean

1822
03:04:55,080 --> 03:04:57,080
I'm not actually dumping you

03:04:59,480 --> 03:05:01,480

She's associated with to any cancel that vtuber

1829
03:05:21,560 --> 03:05:25,960
I mean some people just don't want to associate themselves with me, which is fine. So that's why I don't really

1830
03:05:26,680 --> 03:05:28,920
Um raid too many new people

1831
03:05:30,040 --> 03:05:32,520
Because I don't want to step on any toes

1832
03:05:33,240 --> 03:05:36,600
I don't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable

1833
03:05:40,360 --> 03:05:42,920
Uh and then I should probably

1834
03:05:44,840 --> 03:05:46,840

That bell pepper has been through thick and thin with me and you made me throw it in the trash
