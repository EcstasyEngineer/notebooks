Could you survive living in France?
Probably not, let's be honest, no foreigner could.
They're unhinged over there.
But let's test your French knowledge anyways.
What is dobe?
It means to stink.
Come on, you should be familiar with that one.
How about le toad à la naix?
It means piece of cake.
But if you were to directly translate it,
it means to put your finger up your nose.
I don't know how they got piece of cake from that.
And finally, what is lâcher une caisse?
It means to fart.
And now you're a real Frenchie.
Good luck out there.
And don't be scared, they can smell your fear.
