Why was the jack-o'-lantern so afraid to cross the road?
Because it had no guts, and neither will you once I'm done with you.
I'm Amy Bezu from Feelers Generation 1, Indulge,
and I am so excited to play with you. Better sleep with one eye open tonight,
or I might just end up in your bed with you, pealing your lip skin to make my love potion for you.
Good night.
