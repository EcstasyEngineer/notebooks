Spooky, oooky, pumpkin, he, orange, round, oh boy
He rollin' wobble round the patch, working for a tasty snack
Spooky, oooky, pumpkin, I saw for a flight
He'll bite your toes and then you know he's an evil boy tonight
World-tanned, riddle, squashy one you'll never understand
You think you're super spooky, but really, you're just mad
Spooky, oooky, pumpkin, wumbo all you make
Terrorized the neighborhood on this Halloweeny night
World-tanned, riddle, squashy one you'll never understand
You think you're super spooky, but really you're just mad

He rollin' wobble round the patch, working for a tasty snack
