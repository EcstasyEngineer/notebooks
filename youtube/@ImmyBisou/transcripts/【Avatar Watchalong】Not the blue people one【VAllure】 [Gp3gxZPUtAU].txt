that's us on screen uh i don't think i could like i don't think i could water bend like her
thought i was kind of stupid
piss bending it's water bending
wow what an asshole you want to be mean to that uh you want to be mean like that to me right
never never good good good good right answer
he's feeling a going left uh oh this is where water bending helps right can she walk on water
like jesus only if you deserve it i would never deserve it
can i get a chip sure there you go
yeah he's an asshole she does so much for him can i look the seasoning off your
vinkies sure
what a girl boss you bring that iceberg down onto him
so close just the average twitter dude
that means she's powerful what you'll be
oh he's got character growth that's good i can appreciate some character growth
oh my god
someone call him the last air but
why is he bald
i'm sure being frozen in um and iceberg would will do that to you
well my poster just fell off the wall uh
oh my god
isn't he the bad guy
the bald one i heard people simp after him right
friend sukel
is sukel for now
he's kind of pissed pressed for nothing
sukel's the best it's me i simp for him why do people simp for him he's basically a kachon
the kachon's not sexy there's nothing to simp after for him
he needs that tea
he does he needs to chillax
this is this feels like a spongebob moment water
he's in printing on her what does that mean what
i'd simp for him he got that's the point simp for me and i'll simp for you back
he's a sexy kachon is that even possible
oh it's so ugly but it's kind of ugly in a ratty way so it's kind of cute at the same time
kind of like you
wait a minute
i don't want mental i gotta mute my mic for a second not because i'm farting
it was not farting i forgot to mute wait actually oops oh well if you were farting you just unmute right
i don't know i don't i feel like people already think i'm really weird and i haven't even done anything that crazy
nobody thinks you're weird
you're a bad liar
it's part of the appeal like it's part of the appeal for some people i guess
to me i'm not weird i'm just being myself but i think it's a little off-putting to others
oh he's kind of cute as long as you're not chain farting what's chain farting mean
that old man is kind of relatable
partying simultaneously that's what chain farting is i don't get it
why does zooka look so old
i really is a mood yeah
uh oh like a machine gun oh like my like my alert
he needs he looks old because he needs his honor back
thanks ages you prematurely
your alert is one big fart a chain is multiple farts all like a machine gun
the animation is kind of cutely bad at some points
i guess it's just like reminiscent of like older shows
oh shit he's going sickle mode that was cringe i'm sorry
it is from 2005 that's fair
oh
this is a very small village
i wonder how much inbreeding happens here
so
for next for the next watch along let's get a setup where you're sitting on big bro's lap
i i could i guess i could
you want that you don't think you'll get a little distracted
distraction is the point oh but don't you want to watch the show
um thank you for the one dollar your voice even any poking is involuntary
so
i've seen it a million times okay you can do whatever you want but just don't distract me
i want to watch it
again
so
but he did get it right he had fire
i'd rather spend time with those lists you are spending time with me
i would be a firebender
i i do firebend i can't press the toggle right now but i do
he's so real i must finish my roast duck piss bender
shut your trap
i gotta pee
i wish i could raise my hand too
so
bro he's so is his name aang
he's so random equals funny
so
but doesn't she already know
does that mean aang can fly
he matures a lot as the show goes on okay that's good
so
so
i'm sticking my tongue out to lick my fingers
so
the character development this show is top tier for real for real
okay i'll believe you i'll believe you
oh she wants to master it she's just a beginner okay okay okay okay okay
uh the pain the pain ones are so cute they look like otters
really enjoyed the asmr of it from earlier today really
i'm i'm surprised no it was a cute concept but i personally like doing more um
um seriously asmr's
but everyone was doing a meme one so i was like okay well i gotta do a meme one
i'm surprised didn't end with us passing out and you stealing our kidneys
that's because strawnee wrote it wrote it and not me if i wrote it i would have ended it like that
so
you love losing a hundred dollars in a dark alley you love you do you love losing your kidneys in a
dark alley too and you're pancreas and one of your lungs and your prostate
if it's for me
maybe not the prostate you already said yes though you can't take it back
so
fire nation attack
yes you're bold
is it both or just one both kidneys what's the kappa
what do you mean i'm a kappa is that what is the kappa
uh uh my phone's falling
uh oh
they got trapped in the boobies
oh it's an emote on twitch
but what is it what is it
i found the avatar
even though steal your soul from your butt oh i am a kappa i am i would do that
oh so we continue okay
um
okay ah stop playing don't play okay let me uh reset that
and we are now on episode two
um
you said the thing what you're munching on chips give us a countdown for starting the next
episode um okay i'm not skipping the intro by the way i'm watching the intro

oh my god netflix come on you're beating my ass right now
um
okay ready let's try that again one two three now okay there we go
water earth fire air
long ago the four nations lived together in harmony then everything changed when the fire
only the avatar master of all four elements could stop them
but when the world day had most he vanished a hundred years passed into the
um
is there a world that needs to be saved
i'm calling you now reciting the intro together every time it's going to be a thing
do you want me to do that i can do that big stuff there's a war okay okay
uh-oh
the way he says booby trap is so cute there was this booby trap
you're starting the intro after a few episodes is pretty much a canon event for the show
well it looks like i'm a quick learner because i started reciting it
earlier than a few episodes
i'll stop being an asshole soca
sock on my balls that was a stupid name
every time immy wiggles her wiggles with her shocked face an angle gets their wings
here let me give another angle their wings
he's gonna go get kidnapped by what's his name edgy klutch on
you're the only angle here because you're a cute little sis that's nice thank you
i want an asshole village
but she is a waterbender just practice by yourself
i went to take a break from eating chips
i finished my tea too
does any ever get a love interest because that's kind of i don't know i don't really like love
interests in kids shows maybe because i'm a salty little shit but you gotta drink i have water now
spoilers yes uh no spoilers unfortunately yes
of course he does of course he does
oh my god what's this guy's name again zuko zuko so
isn't he like 15 i heard he's supposed to be really young at the start i mean they're all really young
can't call us out for spoilers after you ask for the answer well you can just say yes or no you
don't have to be specific just be like yeah he does get a love interest you know
they're all around 15 he's so emo
why does he have face paint on is this supposed to be like war paint
it makes him look a little silly i mean he's already kind of silly and he's like 10 to 11
well he was stuck in that iceberg for a long time
oh man ride bitch

i love watching soca get owned
that's what you get for being a bitch to your sister
oh damn he got a hit on him
uh oh
oh
yeah
ain't safe a day
I hope if you get a new outfit you use the old one for any kind of magic streams, it seems fitting.
I'll still use the old one sometimes too.
Of course, I still think it's cute.
You're the avatar?
No way.
Are you gonna watch the whole show with us eventually or is it just watching as far as we can today and that's it?
I feel like I should watch the whole show, right?
I just don't know if people would want to watch the whole thing with me.
It might be a little boring because it's such a long show, right?
Would you let me watch some episodes alone or do you want to watch everything with me?
Continue if you want to, that would be a fun to watch, watching it together.
I'll watch anything you want to watch?
Movie day stream? I can't stream all day.
Not today at least.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I don't want to watch it if people don't want to watch it, you know?
I'll watch it all with you, really?
We can pick up where you left off.
I'd be down and I'd be down.
I'd stick around.
Okay, okay.
I'd like to see...
I'd like some reactions to cut up footage at some point, though.
Some reactions to cut up footage?
Like clips where I show what I'm reacting to, is that what you mean?
If you don't like the series, then no one is having fun.
I have no problem with this so far.
I just don't want people to be bored by me doing come often.
Frequent watch-alongs, you know?
Maybe members only?
I don't know.
I feel like that's a dick move to put it behind a paywall, though.
Haha.
I feel bad for putting anything behind a paywall.
Wouldn't ever be bored?
Okay, if you want to.
Could be every two weeks.
It would be a really, really slow progress to finish the show
if I just watch a little bit every two weeks, right?
You know...
It would take forever to finish it.
Fatherless, fatherless, sad, fatherless child.
A little orphaned boy.
I suppose you wouldn't know about fathers.
We can fix your Zoomer brain rot once we run out of time?
But how would this show fix my Zoomer brain rot?
Oh my god, I'm literally so hot I can feel myself dripping sweat on the sides of my body.
Oh shit, I'm looking to gooo!
Dripping.
The avatar just escaped!
Hot? Really? Take some clothes off?
I'm not wearing anything underneath, though.
I don't really like being naked.
I'm not overdressed. I'm just wearing pajamas.
Hot.
You just want me to get naked.
Yep yep.
It's flying!
Haha.
We got the piss, now we need the sweat.
Now we need the sweat?
Chat, do you think?
You didn't get no...
Yeah, you got a little bit of piss, but what am I supposed to do with sweat?
Sweatbending is canonically a thing in this show, so it's kind of fitting.
I guess sweat is water, so yeah.
Ah, look at him sleeping like a little baby.
You know, non-live videos will always see what you're reacting to in the corner.
Cut up to a boring sort of thing.
If you can't, that's fine.
If you can, that's fine.
Non-live videos.
Non-live.
The only thing I can think of, I mean, thank you for the five dollars, Dan,
but the only thing I can think of is clips where I cut up my reaction
and then, like, edit in the show, the part of the show that I'm reacting to.
Oh, TTS, it's still audible? Oh, I'm sorry.
Here.
I muted it.
It's not audible to me, I can't hear it myself.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, I turned it off, I turned it off now.
Oh, shh, get shot on, Zuko.
How do they know that he's the avatar?
Is it just because he's got arrows?
Good girl.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
How do they know that he's the avatar?
Is it just because he's got arrows?
Good girl.
Ah!
Thank you.
He's an air banger, he's bald.
You'll find out.
Okay, all those are different answers.
Oh, no.
They'll explain?
Well, he's the last air bender.
Well, with that, I don't get it.
Like, he's the last one, yeah.
But why does that make him the avatar?
Because he's an air bender.
Bald power!
Oh, the arrows are distinctly air bender.
Oh, okay.
You'll find out.
Can you just fly away?
What are you doing? Just fly away.
Oh my god, this is when he gets awakened, right?
He had a dream about this.
He learned how to water bend!
Yo!
Look at him go!
Can't fly without his staff, oh.
The dream was how he got in the iceberg?
Oh.
Oh!
Jump scare!

A dent? It's a saddle dent.
Game or basin?
He does have a dent in his back.
A dent in his back.
But doesn't he already know?
He did it pretty good.
Hop up, please, League.
A dent in his back.
I like that.
I also find it fun when people don't want me to ride them.

Can we quickly?
Yes, I don't know what there are.
I need to go get my scissors, hold on.
I got two packages from you guys, I'm guessing.
Okay, let's open the first one.
Yeah, I said package.
Definitely lobotomy toys?
I'm not lobotomizing anyone.
Is it the bear? No.
I thought it was.
I thought it was going to be that.
Because it seemed like it would be.
But it's not.
I'm not actually sure.
I'm not actually sure what it is.
What is this?
Is it a rabbit? No.
Open.
What is this?
I have so many packages.
I'll thank you for becoming a pinpal jeery fish.
Is it from Throne? I'm guessing.
I've had so many packages lately though.
Wait, what is this?
But I don't really remember any of them.
I think it's my shock collar.
Oh my god, it's the shock collar.
I kind of want to try it out.
I want to try it.
Let's give it a quick test.
I want to test it so bad.
Doesn't need a charge?
You're right, I don't know.
Let's open this box.
It's so cute.
It's really stylish.
It's like a...
Oh god, I'm so scared.
Is it heavy?
No, not at all.
It's really light.
Let me see the instructions.
One of the devices down
unable to press the reset button.
The instructions will color it.
It's just black.
You can look on Throne if you want to know what it looks like.
I'm very confused on how this works.
The instructions are really badly translated.
When the device is down
and unable to operate, please press
the reset button to restart the device
in order to reset it.
There's only one button here and it doesn't make sense.
Did I do it?
Maybe it's dead.
Oh, there's an app!
Is there an app?
There is an app.
Press the padlock beam.
Oh my god, to lock it.
Oh my god.
Have you tried turning it on and off again?
Device online charging status.
They have a bunch of pictures in the instructions
where it says
there's a picture of the Hulk throwing the color
and it's like, do not throw.
And then there's a guy wearing it while running
and I'm guessing don't wear it while you're exercising.
There's another guy.
These pictures are so funny.
I wish I could show you.
Imagine if Pimpel is at control of it.
That's the goal, baby.
That's the fucking goal.
Oh my god.
Guys.
It comes with a lock.
It comes with a lock and a key.
Just take a photo and show us.
I will. After stream, I'll take a photo.
It comes with a lock and a key.
That's so fucking crazy.
Put it on.
I don't think it works.
I have to charge it.
I'm guessing.
I'm going to plug it in right now.
The gears are turning.
The gears are turning.
The gears are turning.
Let me plug it in.
Okay.
The next thing.
I also don't know what it is.
I have a feeling I know what it is, but I'm not sure.
If we can't control it directly, how about you do it manually
as in we give you a don't know and you activate it yourself?
Yeah.
Yeah, that works too.
Here, let me see.
Little devil.
Little devil.
Let me go on my phone to see if I can find the app.
Let me go on my phone to see if I can find the app.
Little devil.
That's such a strange name.
Because it shows that there's an app.
Maybe I shouldn't try to figure this out now.
The Bluetooth
After you
turn on the crawling mode.
Oh, this is really badly translated.
Bluetooth and crawling mode.
I know Shibi also got this shock color,
so maybe why would you get a shock color
if you have no one to shock you?
Doesn't seem fun to shock yourself.
It doesn't seem fun to shock yourself.
Get out of my chat.
You don't know me.
Um.
Players.
So this is a new dongle
on an endurance stream, right?
Like
like shock me?
I wish I had like a QR code
for me to download the app
because I can't seem to find it anywhere.
Okay, whatever.
I'll open another.
I'll open the other thing now.
Website says to search for
Queen app.
Oh, for the app.
Okay, okay, okay.
Thank you for helping.
Thank you for helping.
Thank you.
Queen
Queen

is it safe to really shock yourself that often
it feels like um
like uh
like those shocks from like
what's it called
like those static shocks
it feels like static shocks
but it's all around
it's all around by neck
mostly in the front
i'm gonna drink some water

another one
you're nervous impulses that control them
normally are also electrical signals
you can try on twitch
i don't think we'll be streaming on twitch at all

be reported for is self harm

it's like the opposite of self harm
just one more
okay
i just unbuckled it somehow
come on
