WEBVTT

01:00.000 --> 01:08.700
Yeah.

03:00.000 --> 03:10.840
I have a confession to make today, to all of you.

03:10.840 --> 03:20.640
Would you still love me if I was disgusting, if I was nasty, if I was gross, dirty, stinky?

03:20.640 --> 03:21.640
Yeah?

03:21.640 --> 03:22.640
Yeah?

03:22.640 --> 03:23.640
You would?

03:23.640 --> 03:30.640
You wouldn't go back on that, right?

03:30.640 --> 03:39.640
You wouldn't change your mind after you hear what I have to say, would you?

03:39.640 --> 03:41.640
No?

03:41.640 --> 03:52.640
Well, then I guess I can say it.

03:53.640 --> 03:56.640
Pin pals?

03:56.640 --> 04:00.640
I shot myself this morning!

04:08.640 --> 04:11.640
I shot myself!

04:11.640 --> 04:17.640
I took a big ol' boopie in my pants!

04:17.640 --> 04:20.640
Okay, so you still love me, right?

04:20.640 --> 04:23.640
Take it back!

04:23.640 --> 04:24.640
Say it!

04:24.640 --> 04:26.640
Say it!

04:26.640 --> 04:29.640
Say it, say yes!

04:29.640 --> 04:34.640
It doesn't matter the context, I'll tell you the context, but I need you to say yes first.

04:34.640 --> 04:41.640
Okay, okay, good.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.640
Okay, I'll tell you the context!

04:43.640 --> 04:47.640
Oh fuck, no!

04:47.640 --> 04:49.640
That's it, that's the stream.

04:49.640 --> 04:55.640
That's it, I'm done, that's all I have to say for today!

04:55.640 --> 05:00.640
Okay, okay.

05:00.640 --> 05:04.640
I'll tell you the context.

05:04.640 --> 05:09.640
So, you know how I said I was sick yesterday?

05:09.640 --> 05:18.640
Well, today I was just sitting on my computer looking at TikToks to show you for the stream.

05:18.640 --> 05:21.640
And I felt like I needed to fart.

05:21.640 --> 05:29.640
So, you know, as one does when they feel like they need to fart, I farted.

05:29.640 --> 05:36.640
Um, little did I know that it was not truly a fart.

05:36.640 --> 05:43.640
It was going to be a shark.

05:43.640 --> 05:49.640
Ew, ew.

05:49.640 --> 05:55.640
I sharded my pants!

05:55.640 --> 06:01.640
Way more than a little came out, it was so gross, it was so like...

06:01.640 --> 06:03.640
Should I go into the texture?

06:03.640 --> 06:06.640
I don't have a shit kink, I don't have a shit kink.

06:06.640 --> 06:15.640
Don't, I don't have a shit kink, please don't start like thinking that I do, okay?

06:15.640 --> 06:19.640
I'm not into poo poo poo poo, okay?

06:19.640 --> 06:24.640
I'm eating sausage rolls.

06:24.640 --> 06:28.640
I just thought it was a funny story to tell you.

06:28.640 --> 06:33.640
And you would tell me if you shot yourself too, right?

06:33.640 --> 06:41.640
I want you to tell me, I want to hear all of your embarrassing stories.

06:41.640 --> 06:48.640
And I'm also drinking coke.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.640
Right.

06:50.640 --> 06:54.640
No, I don't want pictures of your shit!

06:54.640 --> 07:02.640
No, we're not that close yet, we're not that close yet for you to send me pictures of your poop.

07:03.640 --> 07:15.640
Right, before I start, thank you to the person who got me a drawing tablet because now I can do an art stream.

07:15.640 --> 07:18.640
And I really want to design a 2.0.

07:18.640 --> 07:23.640
Now, I think some people misunderstood me the first time when I said I wanted to make a 2.0.

07:23.640 --> 07:26.640
So let me clarify myself.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.640
What are sausage rolls?

07:29.640 --> 07:32.640
It's sausage with bread inside.

07:32.640 --> 07:35.640
Poop tributes instead of cum tributes?

07:35.640 --> 07:39.640
I mean, I shot on the toilet to the thought of you today.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.640
I love you.

07:41.640 --> 07:43.640
Right.

07:43.640 --> 07:48.640
So, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.640
So I, it's not like I don't like this design.

07:51.640 --> 07:58.640
I think it's really cute, I really like it, but also like, you know, I, as an artist, I'm very picky.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.640
And I want to be emo.

08:00.640 --> 08:06.640
Um, but that doesn't mean I'm going to like unlollify myself, lollify my, unlollify myself.

08:06.640 --> 08:07.640
I'll still look the same.

08:07.640 --> 08:14.640
I'm not going to give myself, myself like giant tits and ass and make myself like five foot seven or anything.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.640
I'm going to look the same mostly.

08:16.640 --> 08:22.640
I just, well, not the same, but like, uh, uh, uh, uh.

08:22.640 --> 08:26.640
Like the character itself will remain the same, you know?

08:26.640 --> 08:30.640
So yeah.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.640
I want to do that next week.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.640
I think that would be really fun.

08:33.640 --> 08:35.640
Yeah, like a hot topic.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.640
We're going to design it next week together.

08:37.640 --> 08:46.640
I really want to.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.640
Could have an opi toggle.

08:48.640 --> 08:49.640
I don't think I'm going to do that.

08:49.640 --> 08:55.640
I don't think people want me to do that.

08:55.640 --> 08:58.640
You know, I'm the special one in this, in this group.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.640
I'm the special one because I'm the only one without boobs.

09:01.640 --> 09:02.640
Okay.

09:02.640 --> 09:05.640
I think that's all I had to say.

09:05.640 --> 09:09.640
Oh, piercings would be really fun.

09:09.640 --> 09:17.640
Oh, now you got me thinking where the piercing could go.

09:17.640 --> 09:23.640
So, so, so, um, no, I'm not turning myself into a furry.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.640
Absolutely not.

09:25.640 --> 09:30.640
So I picked out.

09:30.640 --> 09:34.640
Let me make sure sound is okay.

09:34.640 --> 09:42.640
Should I go to the gaming screen?

09:42.640 --> 09:43.640
Yeah.

09:43.640 --> 09:46.640
If you want to give me scars, that's fine.

09:46.640 --> 09:52.640
Like, um, you can like make a, sorry, I am still sick.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.640
I showed myself this morning.

09:55.640 --> 09:59.640
If you want to do like a Pinterest board or something.

09:59.640 --> 10:04.640
Um, and you can send me the link to it through marshmallow.

10:04.640 --> 10:05.640
That's cool.

10:05.640 --> 10:06.640
Obviously.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.640
Yeah.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.640
I think you can send the link.

10:10.640 --> 10:13.640
Um, go ahead.

10:13.640 --> 10:16.640
Okay.

10:16.640 --> 10:19.640
So RGB boom tattoo.

10:19.640 --> 10:21.640
Maybe I can make it glow.

10:21.640 --> 10:29.640
But apparently, apparently I learned very, very, uh, recently that a womb tattoo that

10:29.640 --> 10:34.640
glows is a womb tattoo that's been, or no, a womb tattoo that glows is a womb that's

10:34.640 --> 10:40.640
been, um, fertilized.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.640
And I didn't know that.

10:42.640 --> 10:50.640
So I feel like, how long should I make by you?

10:50.640 --> 10:54.640
Should I make my womb tattoo glow?

10:54.640 --> 10:58.640
Is that what you want?

10:58.640 --> 10:59.640
Okay.

10:59.640 --> 11:04.640
Um, so how am I going to do this?

11:04.640 --> 11:06.640
I downloaded a bunch of Tik Toks.

11:06.640 --> 11:13.640
It's probably not enough to fill up the whole time, but basically what I want to do here,

11:13.640 --> 11:20.640
well, I'm eating my sausage rolls.

11:20.640 --> 11:31.640
Um, gender bench version of myself.

11:31.640 --> 11:39.640
Um, I don't see why not because it's still me, but also I don't want to, I don't really

11:39.640 --> 11:41.640
want to be gender bent.

11:41.640 --> 11:48.640
I feel like if I'm going to put all this effort into a model, I want to be like me.

11:48.640 --> 11:52.640
With two inch, shut the fuck up about my two inch cock.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.640
It's way bigger than that.

11:54.640 --> 12:00.640
Someone a long time ago, like, head cannon that my dick is two inches long, and now everyone's

12:00.640 --> 12:03.640
just going for it and saying I have a two inch long penis.

12:03.640 --> 12:07.640
It's, and they gave I see a seven inch long penis.

12:07.640 --> 12:08.640
Like what the hell?

12:08.640 --> 12:09.640
That's not fair.

12:09.640 --> 12:26.640
I should be the one with a seven inch long dick.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.640
Two inches is big.

12:29.640 --> 12:34.640
Oh, I'm going to hold my, I'm going to hold your hand when I, when I tell you this, but

12:34.640 --> 12:36.640
it's not.

12:36.640 --> 12:37.640
Okay.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.640
How am I going to do this?

12:39.640 --> 12:41.640
That's not right.

12:41.640 --> 12:42.640
Okay.

12:42.640 --> 12:43.640
Right.

12:43.640 --> 12:44.640
So.

12:44.640 --> 12:45.640
All right.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.640
If you see my full name and address.

12:47.640 --> 12:48.640
Okay.

12:48.640 --> 12:49.640
Okay.

12:49.640 --> 12:50.640
Okay.

12:50.640 --> 12:51.640
Okay.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.640
Okay.

12:52.640 --> 12:53.640
Okay.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.640
Okay.

12:54.640 --> 12:55.640
Okay.

12:55.640 --> 12:56.640
Okay.

12:56.640 --> 12:57.640
Okay.

12:57.640 --> 12:58.640
Okay.

12:58.640 --> 12:59.640
Okay.

12:59.640 --> 13:00.640
Okay.

13:00.640 --> 13:01.640
Okay.

13:01.640 --> 13:02.640
Okay.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.640
Okay.

13:03.640 --> 13:04.640
Okay.

13:04.640 --> 13:05.640
Okay.

13:05.640 --> 13:06.640
Okay.

13:06.640 --> 13:07.640
All right.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.640
If you see my full name and address, please close your eyes.

13:09.640 --> 13:13.640
Oh that's not it.

13:13.640 --> 13:14.640
Okay.

13:14.640 --> 13:17.640
Why does VeeTube studio work?

13:17.640 --> 13:21.640
Why does it say that it's capturing VeeTube studio?

13:21.640 --> 13:23.640
What?

13:23.640 --> 13:31.640
I'll put it over there.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.640
Okay.

13:33.640 --> 13:37.120
Okay, that doesn't work wrong thing

13:40.160 --> 13:42.160
Okay, let's not do that

13:51.640 --> 13:54.200
Oh, there we go there we go

13:54.360 --> 13:56.360
Oh

14:00.440 --> 14:03.360
She's an iPhone or what makes you know what makes you say that

14:04.360 --> 14:09.360
Wait, did you see that I have iPhone connected? Oh, yeah, of course. I have my oh wait now you can see everything

14:12.080 --> 14:14.200
Is there nothing anything sus in there

14:15.600 --> 14:20.280
No, of course I have an iPhone connected. I'm using a freaking model. All right

14:24.800 --> 14:31.180
I'm using a vtuber model. Of course. I have an iPhone. There we go. There it is. Okay, and now the sound we just need sound

14:33.240 --> 14:35.240
This one

14:40.480 --> 14:46.640
Okay, well if I you know accidentally make it too loud, I'm sorry. Yeah, let me turn off the background music

14:46.640 --> 14:53.320
Yeah, thank you for the suggestion. I found his trash. Well, it's good for tracking vtubers. Unfortunately

14:54.960 --> 14:56.960
I

14:57.280 --> 14:59.280
Right

15:00.760 --> 15:03.840
So how this is gonna work is I'm gonna show you a

15:05.200 --> 15:07.200
Tiktok and

15:07.200 --> 15:11.040
I want now these are all my favorite tiktoks from like the past few weeks

15:11.040 --> 15:17.800
I've curated curated my folder here of my favorites. So I want you

15:18.600 --> 15:21.180
I want you to rate them. Yeah

15:21.840 --> 15:23.840
You're the one doing the meme review

15:24.200 --> 15:25.880
Okay

15:25.880 --> 15:29.520
So, yeah, I want you to read every single one

15:38.000 --> 15:42.480
I curated it just for you, right? I think they're funny

15:43.800 --> 15:45.800
Okay, so

15:46.160 --> 15:51.280
Guys seriously, how do I get my roommate's boyfriend to stop serenading her in my presence?

15:54.280 --> 15:58.680
And then they fucking go in for a snuggle. That's okay

16:00.960 --> 16:02.960
That's really all

16:03.360 --> 16:09.600
This is why I'm happy that my mom never forced me to live on campus with a roommate because this is what I imagine it's like

16:11.800 --> 16:13.800
Absolutely no shame

16:15.080 --> 16:17.880
Absolutely no shame just in front of the roommate the poor girl

16:18.000 --> 16:23.960
If I was her I'd be really pissed because I hate seeing happy cobbles in front of me

16:24.880 --> 16:30.040
Okay, next one next one next one. I do work here. Yes, I do. Can I help you you work here? Yes

16:30.040 --> 16:36.560
How may I help you? I'm glad somebody does I'm looking for a kentia palm. Okay, kentia palm specifically

16:36.840 --> 16:41.280
You work at a plant nursery. I'm gonna make a bold assumption that you know what that is kentia palm

16:41.280 --> 16:45.400
Yeah, let me look at our system just so I can see if we have it in stock

16:46.200 --> 16:48.200
Sir sir

16:49.480 --> 16:54.000
Hello, sir, we're still looking. Okay. We're still looking for that kentia palm. We have one in the back

16:54.160 --> 16:59.400
They're putting it in my car right now. Oh, excellent. I'm glad you found me 20 minutes to find it. Oh

16:59.680 --> 17:04.120
20 minutes. Oh, no, I didn't know I was gonna go on a wild goose chase today

17:04.120 --> 17:08.720
But I guess he's making it sound like it's your fault to let you know. Well, sorry about that, sir

17:08.720 --> 17:11.520
Yeah, I just want to let you know. Yeah, really sorry, sir

17:12.240 --> 17:14.240
Sorry you had to go through that. Oh

17:14.240 --> 17:17.000
Hi, sir. Do you need help moving it to your car? There he is

17:18.800 --> 17:23.240
What are you talking about? I deliberately sold me the wrong tree the biggest fucking waste of time. Come on, dad

17:23.240 --> 17:24.600
Please calm down

17:24.600 --> 17:31.000
My son, dad, he'd like to talk to you. Hello, my son. You said a nurse speaker. Hi, sir

17:31.000 --> 17:34.920
I work here at the nursery. I was just trying to tell your dad that we do have a kentia palm

17:34.920 --> 17:40.000
Oh my god, the face. You're still interested in buying it. You hear that dad. They have it. There isn't a problem

17:40.400 --> 17:45.000
Hey, man, I'm really sorry about this. Oh, don't need to apologize. This happens all the time

17:45.480 --> 17:53.840
He looks constipated. Okay. So the only reason I show you this is because I've worked in customer service and this felt very

17:56.320 --> 17:58.320
Relatable to me

17:58.360 --> 18:00.120
Five out of ten

18:00.120 --> 18:04.400
Come on. That was the least of six. That was the least of six. Maybe sharding out

18:05.280 --> 18:10.400
Sharding out of ten. I'm gonna shard on you next time every time I fart. I'm gonna aim it towards you

18:10.400 --> 18:14.200
I'm gonna turn around and aim it towards you and that way if I sure it's gonna be on you

18:18.160 --> 18:23.600
If you've worked customer service, you know how relatable this is okay old people like

18:24.400 --> 18:26.400
They make everything your fault

18:26.880 --> 18:30.980
Basically, oh, this was priced wrong. It was your fault and you need to fix it for me right now

18:35.280 --> 18:36.080
I

18:36.080 --> 18:38.080
Don't think I have any I

18:39.040 --> 18:44.160
Do have like one guy who came in once I used to work at a grocery store. Oh

18:45.320 --> 18:47.980
My god, I used to work at a grocery store

18:50.080 --> 18:55.060
A long time ago as a cashier and this one guy came up to me and he was like

18:55.600 --> 19:00.320
How much are the chicken like the roasted chickens and I was like, I don't know

19:01.280 --> 19:10.000
Like I may be a long time ago when boomers worked that that's like the norm for cashiers to know the prices of everything

19:10.000 --> 19:14.520
But I said, I don't know but you can go look yourself. So he comes back with a chicken. I

19:15.360 --> 19:21.360
Scan it and he's like no no no no no no a couple weeks ago. The chicken was like 699

19:21.440 --> 19:26.080
Why is it 899 now or something like that and I'm in my head. I'm thinking well

19:26.080 --> 19:28.080
I didn't work here a couple weeks ago

19:28.560 --> 19:30.560
So I don't know so I just told him like

19:31.520 --> 19:35.360
I don't know. Do you want me to call a manager?

19:36.400 --> 19:41.440
And he straight up said no, don't call a manager. The chicken should be 699

19:43.040 --> 19:47.040
Anyways in the end, I think he ended up leaving out of anger because he didn't get his chicken

19:48.560 --> 19:50.560
But

19:50.720 --> 19:54.240
I don't I don't like boomers. It's called inflation literally

19:56.560 --> 20:01.600
I carefully peeled off the label on my Cosmo Stanley tumbler

20:02.880 --> 20:06.160
The packaging was so cute. I had to get it laminated

20:06.880 --> 20:10.800
Fucking water top and I rolled it up and tied it with a scrunchie

20:11.440 --> 20:14.000
And heated it with a blow dryer

20:14.640 --> 20:18.640
To tie it with the scrunchie. I added some glue dots to the back

20:19.840 --> 20:25.600
And now I can use my tumbler. I'll give you context on this one. I'm messing up the label. I'll give you context

20:27.040 --> 20:31.280
Okay, I didn't realize this one might require context. So

20:33.280 --> 20:37.120
Basically, do you know those Stanley cups that are really popular?

20:38.880 --> 20:42.960
This tick tock is using the sound of a girl

20:43.600 --> 20:49.360
Who laminated the wrap like the cardboard wrap around her new Stanley cups

20:49.360 --> 20:52.960
So that way she could keep it on the cup like forever

20:53.920 --> 20:59.360
It's like a weird obsession with Stanley cups people people collect like

21:00.000 --> 21:03.360
Like hundreds of them evolve all the colors. Did you know that?

21:05.360 --> 21:07.760
Free lead poisoning. Wait, does it have lead poisoning?

21:08.560 --> 21:11.840
Not what does it have lead poisoning? Does it have lead?

21:13.040 --> 21:17.120
And so this person just made fun of them by using an ocean spray bottle

21:17.520 --> 21:21.760
On my cosmos Stanley and just and just laminated

21:22.960 --> 21:29.120
I had to get it laminated the packaging was so cute. I asked to get it. I have dated and tied it with a scrunchie

21:29.680 --> 21:31.680
Bruh

21:31.680 --> 21:33.680
Not based, huh? Okay

21:35.680 --> 21:37.680
Oi oi oi

21:37.680 --> 21:40.720
Hey snuggle bear. What's taking you so damn long?

21:42.800 --> 21:44.800

21:45.760 --> 21:50.080

21:50.960 --> 21:52.320

21:52.320 --> 21:55.680
Yeah, well, I guess I just don't want to disturb you. Yeah, whatever

21:56.080 --> 21:59.840

Don't worry. I'm fine. I'll protect you with my life my darling kitten whiskers

22:09.120 --> 22:12.720
Let me know if that damn buck an uber driver gives you any trouble

22:13.360 --> 22:15.360
I can take care of him

22:16.240 --> 22:20.400
I know you can't alpha, but please stop thinking about exploding the drive. I'll be the judge of that

22:20.880 --> 22:23.280
You remember what happened the last uber driver, right?

22:24.240 --> 22:26.240
Yeah, it was a pretty grim sight

22:27.520 --> 22:30.640
One thing I'm gonna do it's finish the damn job

22:31.200 --> 22:36.480
Well, anyways princess. I'm gonna keep practicing my lethal explosion technique until you get here

22:37.360 --> 22:43.200
Hold on. I just realized that my I need to change something about the desktop audio hold on

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
desktop audio

22:47.120 --> 22:49.120
Okay there

22:51.360 --> 22:53.360
10 out of 10 5 out of 10

22:54.320 --> 22:56.320
It's supposed to be cringe on purpose

22:56.880 --> 23:00.560
Okay, my glorious emperor. I'll see you very soon. See you soon snuggle bear

23:06.880 --> 23:10.400
You want me to call you my little kitten whiskers

23:15.360 --> 23:19.040
It's it's one of those cringe like ladies use this if you ever feel unsafe

23:20.880 --> 23:24.000
If you ever feel unsafe in an uber 2 out of 10

23:24.640 --> 23:29.920
What I like this person this person makes really funny bakugo um cringe stuff

23:30.160 --> 23:34.000
It's supposed to be cringe on you on on purpose on purpose zero out of 10

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Oh

23:36.240 --> 23:38.720
You don't understand real cringe bruh

23:40.000 --> 23:43.600
The ones who are saying nine out of 10 and 10 out of 10 are valid. Thank you

23:46.320 --> 23:48.320
Do you have a cold?

23:48.880 --> 23:50.640
Okay, go

23:50.640 --> 23:55.680
You know my sister had a baby and I took it over because she passed away

23:56.320 --> 23:58.320
And then the baby left

23:58.560 --> 24:00.560
Lost his legs and its arms

24:01.040 --> 24:03.040
And now it's nothing but a stomp

24:04.720 --> 24:06.720
I

24:07.200 --> 24:09.200
Got a cough

24:12.880 --> 24:14.880
All right context of that one

24:16.160 --> 24:18.640
It's from the movie. Uh, was it called shark tail?

24:20.960 --> 24:24.720
And then the baby lost its legs and now it's nothing but a stomp

24:27.280 --> 24:31.200
More context of this one. How is she even human? Is she they said at the start

24:34.720 --> 24:38.640
She said do you have a cold and then I guess the mom lost her voice from a cold

24:38.720 --> 24:40.880
So she was able to recreate the shrimp voice

24:41.920 --> 24:47.920
You know my sister had a baby my sister had a baby. Okay. I'm glad you like that one. I'm glad you guys like that one

24:49.040 --> 24:50.800
You're hard to please

24:50.800 --> 24:52.800
Okay, this one's funny

24:56.240 --> 24:58.240
I hate myself

24:59.200 --> 25:01.840
I had a wish so much

25:04.720 --> 25:07.200
It would that I was never born

25:10.080 --> 25:13.920
I'm so stupid stupid stupid

25:24.160 --> 25:26.160

25:27.440 --> 25:30.320

25:31.120 --> 25:34.720
He's like drawing everything with the surprise face. Oh my god

25:36.240 --> 25:38.240
That's so cute

25:39.520 --> 25:41.520
Relatable out of 10

25:42.240 --> 25:43.920
For sure

25:43.920 --> 25:49.680
Were you guys depressed at 10 years old? I feel like that's kind of young. I feel like not even I was depressed at that age

25:51.920 --> 25:53.920
Literally me

25:54.880 --> 25:56.880
I

25:59.920 --> 26:04.320
Wait, does it say the date 10 years old at 2016 wait in 2016 how old is that?

26:05.200 --> 26:07.920
Wait, how old is 10 years? Oh, I need a calculator

26:09.120 --> 26:11.120
How how old is

26:11.600 --> 26:14.880
Oh, you fucking bitch exposing me using the calculator. Okay, wait, so it's

26:15.680 --> 26:17.680
So it's 20 24

26:18.400 --> 26:20.400
You minus 20 16

26:21.360 --> 26:23.360
So that was

26:24.960 --> 26:28.320
Wait, how do I do the math for this 18 now?

26:32.880 --> 26:34.560

26:34.560 --> 26:39.760
All right. Yeah, it was 10 years ago. Right. Right. Right. Okay. They're 18 now. Right. Right. Real. Okay. Okay. Okay

26:41.440 --> 26:46.800
Can you believe that I'm graduating from college in a few days because I can't

26:47.520 --> 26:49.520
Okay

27:04.640 --> 27:10.320
Okay, no, no wait not graduating from college not graduating from from retubing

27:10.480 --> 27:15.520
Okay, that's why I might not be funny if you don't know french

27:16.560 --> 27:24.400
I just thought the voice was funny. Yes, he's supposed to cry. Oh, no, what did you say? What the fuck dude step the fuck up

27:31.280 --> 27:33.760

Okay, you like that one good good good good good

27:40.400 --> 27:45.600

Like he literally jumps onto the car

28:18.480 --> 28:23.200
And then falls off the other side just to open the door for her

28:25.680 --> 28:31.280
Yeah, exactly work on your gymnastics

28:37.760 --> 28:39.760

28:52.000 --> 28:54.640
I didn't realize how easy it is to find

28:56.160 --> 28:58.160
My name

28:58.160 --> 29:00.000
um

29:00.000 --> 29:05.120
If you know enough information about me from just me saying that I want a gymnastics award

29:08.960 --> 29:10.960
Oh well

29:12.640 --> 29:15.120
Okay, next next meme cooking for him

Also a couple goals. Look how romantic

29:26.240 --> 29:31.040
He's so supportive

29:38.720 --> 29:43.360
He's so what a supportive boyfriend you would react like that too, right, right?

29:45.360 --> 29:47.760
Yeah, she she um

29:48.960 --> 29:51.120
She puts salt on a spoon

29:52.080 --> 29:54.640
And and just drenched it in a little bit of

29:56.800 --> 29:58.800
Of the soup and fed it to him

30:03.680 --> 30:07.280
Of course it's bad, but it doesn't matter if it's bad you're supposed to react nicely

30:08.880 --> 30:11.200
A hard out of 10 it should be a 10 out of 10

30:11.200 --> 30:15.360
I feel like you're I feel like you're trying to dodge the question by saying hard out of 10

30:16.000 --> 30:22.400
I'm fine with you sharding. I'm not gonna say nothing about your

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Bad cooking

God oh good grief that's horrific

30:45.840 --> 30:49.520
Okay, I just like that one because of the scream at the end

Someone in the comments of this one said um that they sound like Darwin

30:57.360 --> 31:02.560

Okay, this one's also a good cut scream

31:36.320 --> 31:38.320
Okay, it wasn't cut but

It was it sounds like she's gonna say I didn't know that that fucking frogs made this sound or something

32:24.320 --> 32:31.280
That frog is crisp. I think frogs don't really a lot of frogs don't really go ribbit ribbit. They go like they make other noises

32:34.000 --> 32:37.440
That was cute though. I like animal tiktoks. You'll see

32:38.640 --> 32:40.320
All right

32:40.320 --> 32:43.200
This one is also very relatable in this economy

32:44.160 --> 32:47.120
I don't even know if I could afford that much water in this economy

32:50.800 --> 32:52.880

Zero out of 10 too pricey. Okay. That's that's understandable. That's understandable understand if some of you um

33:41.280 --> 33:44.320
Puvos can't afford such fine dining

33:44.640 --> 33:46.640

Just thought this was funny

34:36.960 --> 34:38.960
I

34:41.840 --> 34:46.640
Feel like some people are trolling me by constantly saying one out of ten. I have better taste than just one out of ten

34:48.160 --> 34:50.160
Yeah, ten out of ten. Let him be clean

34:50.720 --> 34:52.720

40:15.280 --> 40:18.320
I'm glad you guys are liking my memes. I thought you weren't gonna like them

40:25.200 --> 40:27.200
Okay, maybe you won't like this one

40:31.040 --> 40:33.040
I

40:37.440 --> 40:40.720
Just I don't know how many of you are into my little pony

40:42.400 --> 40:44.400
Do you know this guy? He's like a huge memer

40:45.360 --> 40:47.360
So 10 a 10 10 out of 10

40:48.240 --> 40:49.920
Zero out of 10

40:49.920 --> 40:52.800
Okay, well the ones that are was that spike in one spike

40:53.840 --> 40:57.840
The ones who are reading a little have obviously not seen my little pony. They don't get it

41:01.120 --> 41:04.720
They went on a side quest in the middle of drying

41:10.800 --> 41:12.800
Chad spike

41:16.480 --> 41:19.440
You've seen that man. Yeah, he's like everywhere. He's the one that said um

41:19.840 --> 41:24.800

41:25.440 --> 41:27.440
cocky want boing boing

41:27.920 --> 41:29.920

41:31.200 --> 41:34.480
10 out of 10. Oh my god. I'm glad you guys liked my little pony memes

41:34.480 --> 41:39.120
I had more to show you but I was worried that not a lot of people have watched my little pony

41:39.120 --> 41:41.120
So maybe they wouldn't get them

41:41.120 --> 41:44.880
All you do is you put it in the center here like this and then

41:45.440 --> 41:49.360
Set a fire to it. Yeah, not always, but most of

41:56.800 --> 41:58.800
His quiet panicking

41:59.680 --> 42:01.680
And

42:08.080 --> 42:11.040
Sorry guys, and I didn't play it when it was this bad

42:13.280 --> 42:15.280
Oh my god

42:17.280 --> 42:19.120
And the entire house is gone

42:20.800 --> 42:22.800
Crap oh no way

42:22.800 --> 42:24.800
And

42:27.120 --> 42:29.120
Yeah

42:29.520 --> 42:31.680
What the hell just happened and

42:32.640 --> 42:36.160
Like two seconds and it's gone. You have got to be kidding me

42:37.360 --> 42:39.360
This is not even funny

42:39.520 --> 42:41.520
Seriously, oh my god

42:43.840 --> 42:45.840
It is funny it is funny. I'm sorry

42:48.480 --> 42:50.480
It's fine just be on it

42:51.440 --> 42:56.800
Read the last thing you can't do that in Minecraft. You don't have saves in Minecraft like that

42:58.720 --> 43:02.640
Fire spread was bad. This was pre alpha

43:04.960 --> 43:06.960
What

43:07.040 --> 43:11.360
Are you calling me a pro-minecrafter or yourself a pro-minecrafter? I am not a pro-minecrafter

43:13.760 --> 43:19.760
Yeah, I thought someone said like oh, I bet Amy didn't actually put together her Minecraft world or her mods

43:20.160 --> 43:23.200
Excuse me. You are not giving me enough credit

43:23.360 --> 43:29.520
I worked very hard putting together all those mods and putting together that entire world. Everything was me

43:30.640 --> 43:32.640
Everything was me

43:37.200 --> 43:39.200
I worked very hard on that

43:40.400 --> 43:46.080
I wanted to have an interesting debut and I I don't know how to do many things and I was inspired by dr

43:46.080 --> 43:53.440
Nova E and how she like went went inside her her own brain. I thought that was really cool and I wanted to do something like that

43:54.960 --> 43:56.960
But I didn't want to like

43:57.920 --> 44:02.400
I know I didn't want to commission anyone to do something like that for me. I thought it would be really complicated

44:02.400 --> 44:04.400
So I just did it myself

44:05.680 --> 44:10.960
You're welcome. You did a very good job. Thank you. Thank you for all the praises. Thank you

44:11.440 --> 44:13.440
Um

44:15.040 --> 44:18.400
No, no, no, I didn't I didn't take the ASMR stream down yesterday

44:18.400 --> 44:25.200
I got taken down by youtube for sexual content. If any of you missed the ASMR stream yesterday and you want to watch it still, um

44:27.440 --> 44:29.440
It's on my twitter

44:30.080 --> 44:36.400
I have a link to it on twitter. Just scroll through and you should find the tweet pretty fast good girl

44:36.400 --> 44:38.400
Oh

44:40.000 --> 44:43.680
Next week what's up kittens today. I'm gonna be filming a get ready with me

44:44.560 --> 44:46.560
Hey, this is so freaking kawaii sugoi

44:48.560 --> 44:53.920
Wait, what was that? Call me chihuahua, call neko

44:59.200 --> 45:01.200
Oh, oh my gosh

45:01.200 --> 45:03.200
I

45:03.680 --> 45:05.680
Like this Bakugo

45:16.240 --> 45:18.240
We're literally twins look at us

45:21.920 --> 45:23.920
I don't even know what he's saying

45:31.920 --> 45:33.920
No, of course, it's not real

45:48.400 --> 45:53.920
You guys are giving this low ratings, but you don't know that this is how I act when I'm alone, you don't you really don't

45:54.960 --> 45:56.960
This is how I act when I'm alone

45:57.360 --> 46:01.200
So if you're giving this a low rating then you're gonna fucking hate meeting me

46:03.280 --> 46:07.760
Zero please make it stop. Have I seen a husband out there? No

46:09.360 --> 46:13.440
I am not a husband. I still act like this. Thank you. Thank you

46:16.160 --> 46:18.160
It's it's funny

46:20.000 --> 46:23.600
Okay, I'll move on to to the next one because it's it's cringe apparently

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Okay

46:35.280 --> 46:37.280
I don't understand

46:40.800 --> 46:44.800
I I don't know if this is serious

46:44.880 --> 46:46.880
Oh

46:52.320 --> 46:56.400
I don't know if this is serious or not like I can't tell

46:58.160 --> 47:00.160
He's not even screaming

47:02.080 --> 47:04.080
He's just wheezing now

47:06.640 --> 47:08.640
Yeah

47:09.200 --> 47:11.200
Oh

47:23.200 --> 47:26.400
All right, that was terrible that was torture that was real cringe

47:33.760 --> 47:35.760
He needed to take some local lessons

47:39.360 --> 47:46.160
Okay, so I'm pet sitting this cat and uh Shiloh keep doesn't really like me if I try to go near her

47:46.240 --> 47:47.840
She will kind of like

47:47.840 --> 47:50.480
Yet edge herself away and like leave

47:51.600 --> 47:53.600
However, I did find out

47:53.920 --> 47:58.480
That she will approach me and let me pet her if I'm in a specific cosplay

47:59.520 --> 48:01.520
I cannot believe

48:08.640 --> 48:10.640
I

48:15.600 --> 48:21.280
Still can't believe me cosplaying as gojo works. Look at her. She's making her biscuits on my leg

48:22.880 --> 48:25.120
The purring too relatable

48:26.480 --> 48:29.600
Does pussy run away from you unless you dress up like gojo?

48:34.080 --> 48:37.280
Is that what you mean? That's that's that's what you mean

48:39.520 --> 48:41.760
The tampon gojo video. No

48:42.720 --> 48:44.720
What did they like

48:45.280 --> 48:47.600
Did they like turn a tampon into gojo?

48:48.960 --> 48:52.320
Yeah, it's that easy if girls run away from you all you have to do

48:52.720 --> 48:56.880
It's just dress up as gojo and then they'll just come running towards you

48:57.600 --> 49:00.960
I cannot they'll turn right back around and sit on your lap

49:01.840 --> 49:03.840
She's a gojo sim

49:08.720 --> 49:10.960
You know elon musk, I love this one hasn't cook

49:11.840 --> 49:13.840
Bezos, I love this one. He's not doing laundry

49:14.480 --> 49:15.440
Zuckerberg

49:15.440 --> 49:17.840
He's not mowing his own lawn all these guys

49:18.400 --> 49:21.520
They outsource this stuff that I I do the same now

49:21.600 --> 49:28.240
I have a guy that comes in to sleep with my wife because I don't have the time to be distracted from anything

49:28.320 --> 49:32.320
Which isn't growing revenue. Now, doesn't that make you a cuck?

49:32.960 --> 49:36.880
No, that's just good business anything which isn't making you profit

49:37.440 --> 49:39.440
It's distracting you from how you level up

49:41.120 --> 49:43.120
Listen to them. Yeah

49:44.720 --> 49:51.120
I bet elon musk hires someone to to have sex with his wife too for him. Does he even have a wife?

49:53.760 --> 49:58.480
Sigma out of 10. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. If you want to get on yeah, if you want to get on that alpha grind

50:00.000 --> 50:03.200
If you want to start, you know a drop shipping company

50:03.440 --> 50:10.960
If you want to if you want to get your stonks up all you have to do is just start outsourcing

50:11.680 --> 50:14.880
You know all the all the extra stuff in your life that don't matter

50:15.760 --> 50:17.760
like your wife

50:21.040 --> 50:27.040
Yeah, that's that's the best business advice you're welcome. You came here for memes, but you're really leaving with great life advice

50:28.960 --> 50:30.960
Okay

50:31.520 --> 50:36.400
This is just part this is just part noises

50:48.240 --> 50:51.520
My freaking chair keeps creaking and it sounds like I'm farting

50:54.720 --> 50:56.720
Zero to ten

50:57.040 --> 51:00.960
Look at it pulsating. Oh my god

51:03.920 --> 51:05.920
Like it's jiggling

51:06.960 --> 51:08.960
That's literally how I sound like

51:12.080 --> 51:14.080
Amy this morning

51:15.280 --> 51:17.280
No

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Oh my god

51:20.480 --> 51:24.320
Why does that kind of look yummy too? It looks like nice and crispy and like

51:25.200 --> 51:27.200
I don't know it looks edible

51:33.280 --> 51:37.680
Yeah, like s'mores it looks like s'mores kind of hot right

51:39.920 --> 51:44.640
Listen if the sound was it coming out of this random ass cup, maybe it would be a little hot

51:46.400 --> 51:49.360
Maybe it would be a little hot. Yeah, hear hear me out. Hear me out

51:50.160 --> 51:52.160
No

51:58.320 --> 52:01.600
I should you know how I tweeted out if um

52:03.680 --> 52:05.680
If I should uh

52:06.480 --> 52:09.200
Would you guys be weird out if I queefed into the mic?

52:11.200 --> 52:13.200
I'm gonna do that one day

52:13.200 --> 52:15.200
He had a thin face

52:15.200 --> 52:16.720
boldest eyes

52:16.720 --> 52:20.720
His hair was short and brown. I think it's all a blur. I think I got it

52:22.480 --> 52:24.480
Is this the man who attacked you?

52:24.640 --> 52:27.360
What is he blushing? Well, it's skin pigment

52:28.000 --> 52:30.560
Why are his eyes red? That's his charon gone

52:32.080 --> 52:34.560
Okay, the only reason I put this one is because

52:35.280 --> 52:39.200
In my old sketchbook. I literally used to draw stuff like this and I thought it was really funny

52:39.520 --> 52:49.280
Like literally this is this is probably like almost an exact exact replica of my middle school drawings

52:50.720 --> 52:52.720
Three out of ten

52:53.120 --> 52:58.400
It's his charon gone. I don't think they drew the charon gone correctly. That's not how it looks like, right?

53:01.440 --> 53:05.680
I've heard more people pee on twitter in the last few days than the rest of my life combined. I'm just here for the right

53:06.400 --> 53:09.360
I don't gotta do it. I just think it's funny

53:10.560 --> 53:14.000
Hey, it's funny. I think it's funny to pee too, but I felt like

53:15.280 --> 53:17.280
I feel like

53:18.640 --> 53:22.720
No, I want to hold it back and when I wanted to be a prize

53:24.720 --> 53:27.520
You're so skinny the zoomer stuff is actually killing me

53:28.320 --> 53:31.040
It's funny. Not even not even all of this is

53:31.200 --> 53:33.200
You're asking too many fucking questions

53:33.600 --> 53:35.600
What are you the police?

53:35.760 --> 53:38.240
What are you the fucking police get out of my asshole?

53:39.440 --> 53:43.600
Yeah, I have a screenshot of your parents home address. What am I supposed to not?

53:44.400 --> 53:50.400
I'm supposed to not know everything about you dude. I was supposed to not google your fucking grandma's name

53:51.040 --> 53:54.880
Oh found your grandfather's obituary. I did that in 20 minutes or less

53:55.440 --> 53:59.440
Let me finish eating. Hold on

54:07.600 --> 54:10.160
Okay, I'm officially done eating sausage rolls

54:14.400 --> 54:16.320
I did find this one to be relatable

54:17.760 --> 54:19.760
Right wave material

54:20.640 --> 54:22.640
That's wife behavior

54:23.600 --> 54:25.600
That's wife behavior right there

54:28.560 --> 54:34.240
Mm-hmm, if she really likes you, you know if she wanted to she would and I would and I do

54:39.520 --> 54:43.520
Is she eating a meal deal? What do you mean? What what cup?

54:43.520 --> 54:45.520
I

54:48.400 --> 54:51.040
Have a small talk more um stalking

54:56.560 --> 55:00.560
Wish I was that sausage roll you want me to bite on you and chew you and swallow you

55:05.360 --> 55:10.240
But the never a minute no not every girl does this not every girl not every girl only me

55:11.120 --> 55:13.120
All right, what do we got?

55:17.200 --> 55:21.600
This is just terrible what a terrible situation to be in calling

55:22.160 --> 55:27.360
Okay, so we're all you guys should understand this one. Come on. Don't fold my cards. You're terrible

55:28.160 --> 55:30.720
You should get this one. It's it's so bad

55:32.240 --> 55:36.000
It's all the different numbers the terrible cards

55:36.720 --> 55:38.320
Ah

55:38.320 --> 55:42.560
You guys are no fun. Why'd you take your clothes off? Oh, you're playing house rules

55:43.040 --> 55:48.160
Nope, not what that means and this is our house. Oh, so you guys take your clothes

55:48.560 --> 55:54.480
He's getting excited again. Oh, so nobody's taking their clothes off. All right. You're going back in the trunk. I'm sorry

55:55.280 --> 55:57.280
It's just you keep doing it

55:58.880 --> 56:03.120
I I didn't watch this whole thing so when he got excited again

56:04.080 --> 56:05.680
Terrible cards

56:05.680 --> 56:07.680
in house rules

56:07.760 --> 56:12.480
Oh, I thought we were playing house rules. Nope. Not what that means and this is our house

56:12.880 --> 56:17.520
Oh, so you guys take your clothes. Oh, so you're gonna take your clothes off

56:19.920 --> 56:21.280
Okay

56:21.280 --> 56:27.040
It looks like people understand that's good. That's good. That's good. If you don't understand when rats get happy their eyes pop out like that

56:28.480 --> 56:30.960
So, you know, he had good cards

56:31.920 --> 56:34.080
And also he wanted them to take their clothes off

56:35.600 --> 56:38.960
The exit does make it. He's so cute. Oh, look at little guy

56:41.760 --> 56:46.080

I told you to stay away from me that ad stopped me in my fucking tracks. What the react reactor lady

58:08.240 --> 58:12.400
It's just so this is chosen by fate rejected by the elf

58:15.200 --> 58:20.080
I love cringe stuff like this. I love cringe stuff

58:22.160 --> 58:27.600
You refuse the microchip microchip. Oh my god, you refuse the microchip. Oh, oh

58:28.000 --> 58:33.200

What do you mean not beating the twilight allegations? This doesn't have anything to do with twilight. Oh my god, his face is fucking

58:42.000 --> 58:44.240
What's crazy is I literally okay

58:46.320 --> 58:50.480
Obviously I find this cringe. This is hella cringe, but I literally read books like this

58:52.480 --> 58:56.320
With the cringe ass neat chosen by the alpha. This is the shit I read

58:58.320 --> 59:00.880
I could probably go in my uh in my um

59:02.080 --> 59:04.560
Bookshelf and probably find some cringe name like that

59:05.920 --> 59:07.920
I'm not even gonna lie

59:09.520 --> 59:12.080
This is terrible though. I hate that. I hate that video

59:25.280 --> 59:27.280
I'm sorry

59:28.960 --> 59:31.360

59:36.560 --> 59:40.080
I'm making fun of myself nothing wrong with a little self bird

59:40.800 --> 59:42.800

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.760
15 out of 10

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.080

Okay, I'll show the original to the ones who haven't seen it. So basically

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:34.000
There is a video of I guess an oni-chan

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.960
A competition at an anime event

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:45.680
And it's it's pretty cringe. I'm not gonna lie. Is this it?

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:50.320
Oh god. Oh, fuck

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:57.440
I I almost don't want to watch it. It's so cringe

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.160
Okay, she's cute she did it well she was confident

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.080
Oni-chan

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.840
Oh my god

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.680
Competition's over. She won

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.440
Where is this is he dressed up as steven universe

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.400
Ah

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.120
I just can't imagine

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.360
Oh, he didn't get his he didn't get enough hype

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.360
This hurts. I know

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.360
And I know I know it's I'm I'm literally birding myself here

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.160
By showing you that and laughing and saying it's cringe

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.200
It's okay. I'm I'm cringe. It means turn

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:49.120
I can't I can't not after that not after that give me some time to cool off, please

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.880
I really figured you'd end it with your best

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.840
Why are we so cringe it's because it's funny it's funny

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.800
It means in that video

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.160
No, I'm not should have you'll never see me in there. No

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.240
This is

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.680
And literally moving away from you it's terrifying

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:35.920
Oh my god the art

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.400
This is so lame

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:56.320
Unironically, I think they'd work really well together. I think they would really work well together 10 out of 10. Thank you

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.880
It's just like pen pals and emmy

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:04.640
I'm twilight though, right? You're not making me more to Kai in this ship, right?

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.120
They got like the perfect clips for it too

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:17.280
Someone did put if it's six out of 10 the bisexual lighting right there

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.960
They do have the same colors

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.360
We

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.960
Have this ship even start from the drawing

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:34.560
They show the drawing this drawing this fuck-ass drawing. Oh my god. So terribly me

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.440
It looks like something from deviant art. I feel like you would find this on deviant art

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.120
I

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:01.680

They're so good at the voices right

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.120
They're so

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.640
You are now enslaved that's gotta be racist

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:07.760
Ha ha ha get the damn arrow out of my head. There is no arrow in your head

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:12.560
Am I going schizophrenic? I keep seeing an arrow. We killed our first black person

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.040
We already killed your buddy though. How do you feel about that?

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:22.400
Black bitch shut the hell up dick who I'm going fish. Why the hell did you turn southern? You know, I'm the sexy one

There's more stuff like this

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.480
There's this dude. I think his name is uh pixel something on tiktok

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.880
And he literally live streams as both deku and bakugou

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:47.280
And he like switches between the voices and he's really good at both of them

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.320
And they're so funny. I might have included one of his streams here. I don't know

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:55.120
But that was 10 out of 10. I don't care what any of you guys say that was 10 out of 10. Brilliant. Yes

01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.520
And we cancelled no

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.880
I didn't say anything

This one's just cute

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:28.480
I've seen a guy voice deku while playing cotton. He's so cringe in a funny way. I love it when people do his voice

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.200
I love it. I think it's because his voice is so bad

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.520
It's so like

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:40.320
Like, oh, uh, you know how I said I was watching I watched two year eternity the dub for that literally sounds like

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:47.440

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.760

He sounds exactly like deku and I as soon as I heard the dub for two year eternity. I was like fuck this shit. I'm out

What do you think I should do now do you think no, that's not it was like the first episode. I was like god, that's awful

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.240
Okay

Oh

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:43.600

The dub of my hero academia is better than the sub really I haven't watched much of the show

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:29.120
Okay next meme no one has made this dramatic of a change yet. No one has made in my generation this

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:35.680
Extreme of a switch and I am the first in the generation. It is very scary, but

01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.400
Someone's gotta do it

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:42.800
I just put that one because it's also very relatable. I stopped sleeping in my mom's bed at like

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.560

Do you understand why I had to punish you earlier?

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.280

Because you bit me yeah, yeah, why'd you do that?

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:11.200
Yeah, yeah, are you hungry for your big day today?

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.760
I don't know what the original sound of this is from

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.480
I just

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:25.120
I just think it's really funny. It's um shining armor and uh

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:30.000
Oh, shit. I forgot her name princess

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:38.240

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:44.960
From the crystal kidding cadence cadence cadence. Yeah, princess cadence and shining

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:48.880
But what I have to punish you I just think the audio is funny

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:55.040
Because because you bit me because you bit me. Yeah. Yeah, why'd you do that?

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.800
Bro, look, she's even meowing. Look at that jawline

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.480
Yeah, yeah

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.040
Are you hungry from your big day today?

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:09.600
Oh

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:17.120
You can see the fire in the background

01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:34.160
Is she crying for her mom

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:37.920
It is not me cooking

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.600

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.720
on um

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:51.200
You know on the stove like platform itself. Is that something that people do?

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.840
No pan yeah, it looks like she's using no pan

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.400
So thank you

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.280
I feel like that's a recipe for disaster

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.560
Like it's literally on fire now

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.040
It should be illegal I guess people do it

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:26.480
It's not something that I do but some people are insane like that. Huh my grandmother does it, huh?

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:33.920
Yeah, so this basement apartment gets some fantastic natural lighting over there. Um, don't worry about that

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:36.960
This is the previous tenant the leaving literally sleeping in the bed

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:42.240
To show you the unit when your tenants still in the bed. It's a standard practice now

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.760
There's green tape running down the middle. Uh, so you're gonna be getting the right side of the bed and uh, yeah

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:54.000
That's gonna come right off. Um, this isn't a one bed. No one side of the bed. Yeah, so I'm actually moving back into the unit

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:59.120
I'll be sleeping on the left side. So don't worry. You're not gonna be next to anyone weird. It's just me

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:02.640
Oh, I'm john. By the way, great to meet you. Tom. Let me show you the rest of the space

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:10.000
Uh, so this is my mining equipment. It's mine. It's really big mining equipment. Oh my god washroom

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.400
You've got the standing shower

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:16.720
You're gonna get the right side of the shower to match the right side of the bed. So there's no confusion

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:21.680
The right side of the toilet right side of the sink and right side of the beer

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.640
Any other questions? Sounds fair. How much of this?

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:30.640
Do I have to get married plus utilities? That's a steal right now. What? Why would you?

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:36.240
Well, I guess you're not marrying me. What the hell? Why would you do that?

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:43.920
Is my chat like really behind? I feel like the chat's really behind

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:57.440
Fair deal. What the hell? Okay. I wanted to show this

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:00.240
2000 what did he say?

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.920
2,500 bucks. I wanted to show this because um

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:10.320
When I complained about my neighbors and I said I don't have AC people were like, oh wow, she must be really poor

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.400
She must live in a shithole

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.880
like

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.320
Surprisingly

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.600
It's like

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:20.320
Really like if you live in Canada like

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:24.800
It is the whole entirety of Canada is a shithole. This is this is like

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:31.600
This is if you've seen like the rental prices like this is literally shit people do for real

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:34.800
They will rent like half a room

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.680
And then there's a mattress on the floor there. Well, sorry

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:41.040
There's two mattresses on the floor and you have one half of the room

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:47.760
With you know one mattress and then your roommate lives in the same room with you with the other mattress on the floor

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:53.840
Like Canadian prices are legitimately like that like I got I got lucky

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.160
Like I don't I don't I don't live in a shithole

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.240
Like I live pretty

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:09.600
Compared to like what a lot of Canadian places look like today. I feel like I'm okay. I'm doing okay

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:15.680
So, yeah, you're lying. What what do you mean I'm lying? No

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:18.720
I mean, I don't know if it's legal, but I've seen like

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:22.000
A lot of people just rent out their basement

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:30.560
And they'll be like, oh, please enter through the garage door. Um, no guests. No music. No smoking. No pets

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.280
um

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.960
I don't know

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:42.080
400 square feet kitchen is shared bathroom is shared, you know with the with the rest of us. Um

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.360
You're only allowed to enter the kitchen from the times of

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.240
8 a.m. To 3 p.m

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.880
You're only allowed to shower

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.920
From, you know, 8 p.m. To 10 p.m.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:01.280
And then the price will be like three thousand dollars a month. Like that's how bad it is

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:06.000
Mercy's basement is probably kinder. Yeah

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:14.320
Anyways, next meme oh this one's cute

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.880
Oh

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.720
Yeah, at least mercy's rent free even if you're tied up and stuff, you know

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.440
The poor little dog. He looks so old

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:40.800
He was so happy to just sit on the bed with his freaking owner. He just falls really slowly

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:45.760
I hired these two women to cut my grass because I'm all about like supporting women

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:51.280
But they've been working on it for like a week and they're not even halfway finished

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.720
Can someone give me an answer on why it's taking so long?

01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:02.720
Oh, they're so cute halfway finished. Can someone give me an answer? They're naked. Oh, they're so ugly too

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:13.600
Move to southeast asia. Is that what it that sees look at the exact same accommodations for a tenth of the price

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.600
Oh, I know I know

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:17.440
I'm well aware

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:20.560
It's very much a Canadian thing. The rest of the world is not that bad

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.440
So, yeah, um, I love skinny pigs

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.560
They're so ugly

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:31.680
But they're also really cute at the same time

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:36.160
Shaved they're not shaved they're born like that

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:41.120
But yeah, fuck these ladies taking her money and not cutting her grass

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:46.800
How dare they look at them slacking off. I thought it was a dog. It looks like a tiny pig

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:49.600
Oh my god

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:52.400
Yeah, you know in my free time I like to watch this is anime

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:58.080
This is cool. I just love watching anime. You know, I'm actually 116 Japanese

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:05.360
Oh slice of life shows like the the writing's actually really good and like the drama and everything is

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:08.080
I don't really like to talk to people in the real world

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:11.280
Watching them talk to each other and anime is really entertaining

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:15.280
On the episode where they had to go to math class math class fire

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:19.680
Yeah, I'm gonna just watch like in my free time like I'll watch like one or two episodes a day

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:25.280
Or like, you know every couple days all I fucking do is watch anime. You need to take a shower

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.240
How can I watch in the shower? How am I supposed to read subtitles in the shower baka?

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:36.240
I don't need to eat. I don't need to bathe. I don't need to brush my teeth. I like how I lose this anime

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:40.320
Yeah, this one show I watched it's about all these kids are like fall in high school

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.800
They have these superpowers though and then in the show they

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:50.640
Like I'm younger as young as possible

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:56.800
Is he wearing two wigs probably it kind of looks like that, huh?

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:12.800
I like this guy he's so funny. I like him young as young as possible. Oh, this is just a big

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.640
This is just a video for

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.800
10 out of 10 it was very relatable

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:27.760
This is just literally no thoughts in that head

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.960
Me shlorp and now in that dick

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.880
It's so cute

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:42.080
The freaking bulgy eyes gets me every time

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:50.000
You guys don't know but when I was going through my tiktok likes to like download stuff for this stream

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:53.600
Literally every other

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:56.080
Video was just a rat

01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:02.080
Doing something rat content and I had to filter through all of those because I was like I can't just have a full stream of

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.080
just rat stuff

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:11.520
Do my eyes bulge when I sleep if I'm happy enough. Yes, the bulge just like that. Isn't that so sexy?

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:20.640
That's what you see when you wake up that's how I'm gonna wake you up

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:26.960
Oh my god, that's so ugly what happens to a child who isn't loved properly

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:29.040
I

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:36.560
Don't play Genshin, but I think the people who do will enjoy that one

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:45.360
You imagine that as fan art if anyone draws here, I would love to see that

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:51.120
You feel called out good. You should what are you doing wasting your life with Genshin?

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:54.320
Bro, I should stop stop stop stop

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.400
Okay

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:03.040
I don't know how many Canadians are watching

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:08.880
But this is this is how Canadian geese act

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:12.080
like

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:15.120
Play honkai instead. No, don't play any of them

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.320
They're all the same

01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:20.880
This is how Canadian geese act

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:27.520
You say what did you say that goose will be dinner? You say that but you've never met you've never met a goose. You really haven't

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.720
They are so

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.720
They're so mean

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.440
They genuinely act like this

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:46.080
I'd rather play with in me. Yeah, don't play Genshin or honkai play with me

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:53.120
Um, but yeah, I have I used to have a bunch at my school campus and like

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:59.360
They were ruthless. You do not get close to those guys. They will chase you. They will chase you

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.600
I've literally seen videos

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:04.480
from people that go to my school where they

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:10.400
They like film each other getting chased by geese on campus. It's actually really funny

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:14.640
Oh my god, mom you're gonna love this one

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.440
What the hell? I don't know who that is

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
No, read it. Oh

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:22.480
read it

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.800
Who is this guy? Has he been texting you?

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:28.960
He's even texting you. It's a minion. That's just from a movie. Oh, yeah

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:31.920
Just read what it says though. Facebook. No

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:37.920
Log in read what the image says under the minion read it X exercise

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:40.240
Yeah

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:45.200
No, keep going. I just don't understand. I don't know who he's texting me. I'm not getting any of these messages

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:50.160
Because I'm not showing you any text messages. What are you saying? You can tell he's trying not to laugh too

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:58.080
You know what never never mind extra fries. Do you get it? Because exercise is not an extra prize

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:01.040
I know but I just don't know who this is

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:08.080
This is what moms are like for sure every time i'm on my phone around her

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:12.480
She's like, who are you texting? Who are you talking to? Are you texting xyz?

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.160
All right, am I a minion? No, do I look like a minion to you?

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.160
Amy's showing us her memes you guys rating my memes a zero out of 10

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.000
You're too you're too boomer and old to understand apparently

01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.040
Are you in a chat room?

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.880
Are you talking on on my space right now Amy?

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:40.560
So you're telling me if a japanese person talked to you on the phone

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:44.720
They would not know that you were from the united states. No, they probably think I was japanese

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:49.760
I actually speak with a dialect like an accent from the southern part of japan where I grew up. What? That's cool

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:55.200
What does a southern japanese accent sound like corn knee itchy off watashi no namai with josh death

01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:02.320
This is what strutty would probably sound like speaking japanese. Go cheese osama. There's no way that's japanese. Like what the f

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:04.960
Knee horn go galley with terry meska

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.920
That's probably what she sounds like

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.240
I am way cuter than a minion. I'm not a minion

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.880
10 out of 10 eat the ducky mouse

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:22.240
Eat the ducky mouse

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.760
Gary Buster Holmes was that?

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.880
Will terry noscar

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:38.400
Yeah, like he literally sounds like a native southern japanese speaker for sure

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:43.120
Oh, hey yo gozai masu

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:47.600
If an alien abducted me, okay, I relate to this so hard

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:53.360
I love this because this lady like put into words exactly how I feel about alien abductions

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.760
If an alien abducted me

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:59.280
Took time out of his day his or her day

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.240
To beat me up into a spaceship

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.120
Just me not anybody else in neighborhood

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:12.240
I would make love to them back because that means I was chosen special

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:18.720
They didn't just beam up sally next door. No, they chose me because she was out in her yard working

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:23.920
They'd be me up out of my own bed as I'm relaxing playing candy crush. Yeah

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:31.920
So if they took the time to specifically pick me out of all these other humans that are around me

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.880
Yes, I'll make love

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:39.280
Unlike these people on tinder

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.320
Who the only thing they want to do

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:46.000
Is scam me and catfish me and extort money from me

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:54.160
You never know an alien my all these all these women only want your money. Just go fuck an alien. I fall in love with an alien

01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.480
And I'm not opposed to that

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:04.320
I'm not opposed to it either

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I don't want to get pegged by et

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.160
Well, if et loves me enough, I might just let him peg me

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:18.000
Man, we're trying to dissect you. Why are you crying?

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:25.520
Why are you guys saying bogos binted now you're being the zoomer

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:27.680
I

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:31.920
Don't I feel like yeah et got that long finger. I feel like

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.960
I feel like aliens could get really freaky

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:37.760
especially if

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
An alien chose me like

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:48.800
I don't know like he chose me specifically like he chose to to be me. He chose to bogos binted me

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.680
Like uh, I'll get freaky with you if you choose me

01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:02.240
My standard is a little okay. The exam begins now. Good morning. Yes. I'm fine. Um,

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:07.760
Do you have any pets? Yes, I have a dog called freddy. Do you like dogs?

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:12.960
This is the crying face. He looks like he's gonna cry. I do not have a cat

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:15.600
But I do

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.600
Have a horse

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.880
His name is molly

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.040
Sometimes

01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:30.400
She has 46 days. Where do you live?

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:35.360
Perhaps perhaps I live

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:38.400
in a flat

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.560
With my sister

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:44.720
And I also have a mum. What are your hobbies?

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:51.760
My freaking eye twitch food is burgers, but I do not like the color blue. Why don't you like the color blue?

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:55.120
It is bad

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.760
because it is

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:06.800
Although I eat water

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:09.840
I would like

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:14.560
Cheese, okay. Thank you. The test is over. Goodbye. Hello

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:20.080
Okay

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:22.400
So

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:26.320
I don't relate to this because I've never had like french speaking exams

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:30.000
but I relate to this because I took um

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:37.520
I took eight months of japanese class at school and this is exactly how my speaking exams went

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:43.120
They were all we had a bunch of interviews with the teacher and she would ask us questions like this and I swear to god

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:45.120
This is how I was answering

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:50.240
I have a horse named molly

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.480
This is me and my Spanish exams right

01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:59.520
They're they also always talk so quickly to you in the exams

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:05.760
Okay, I'm gonna go um, I'm gonna go pee real quick. I'll come right back

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:09.680
I also weigh my face because I'm really sweaty right now

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:13.840
But I will be back in a couple of

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.600
Minutes

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.560
Oh no

01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:22.960
Oh no momentum

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:26.000
How far are we in the videos? I don't know. I'll be right back

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:47.120
You

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:17.120
You

01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:47.120
You

01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:17.120
You

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.120
You

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:17.120
You

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:47.120
You

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.360
You

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:24.080
Why are you guys spamming waterfalls?

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:31.440
I didn't fall to the second. I'm gone for like more than two minutes. You guys are like she fell into the toilet. She's dead

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:37.920
I did not bring any eminid. No, I flushed all my eminid down the toilet

01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:45.520
Were you fried chicken or that shut up? I was muted. You didn't hear anything. You did not hear anything

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Always did she bring the mic with her?

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.200
She got a shard again

01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:59.360
I secretly sharded my pants and I just didn't tell you guys and I had to go clean up real quick

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.560
It happened again

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:06.640
Who cuts people's air in the middle of the night? I do they call me the midnight barber

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:11.760
Yeah, well that's an infringement of people's liberties. Is it yeah, so don't ever be doing that to me. I do do it to you

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.800
What who do you think cuts your hair?

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:19.040
Einstein my air just doesn't grow very fast. What do you think it stays that length naturally?

01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:23.680
I'm in there in the night styling away. How dare you do that to me in the night when I'm oblivious

01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:25.760
I'll see my best work when you're oblivious

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:28.480
I just thought that was really cute

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:35.840
Because my dog also hates getting her nails cut so I thought this was a good idea too the midnight barber

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.120
I

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:45.360
Just imagine the potential for a wave of blue doughnos. What do you mean a wave of blue doughnos?

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:49.360
Ten ten. Thank you. Not as cute as Amy

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:53.120
Thank you for that too

01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:56.560
It's still really cute though the midnight barber

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:01.600
Burp too quiet

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:05.520
I don't know some people hate burps and some people love them. So I try not to burp too much

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:09.280
My

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:12.160
She would raise you if you know

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:16.800
Should I sing along with him?

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.800
Well, I'm a battle

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:26.800
If she ever does mock me, I'm gonna tell the world she queefs. So she better not mock me

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:33.600
I've been trying to keep my new streak. We've got matters. You heard him say it

01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:39.200
She was the one who taught me the good. She said I'll teach you how to edge soon

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:44.640
We were in Ohio when I first moved. She said better. I'm proud of you

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:48.400
I'm a full sigma and she knows it

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.520
You can be signature if you

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.040
Edge

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.360
I'm so bad at singing

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.880
Edge Max

01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:03.840
Take me to

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:10.640
And keep me awake so you don't get mocked every night drops give it e-raise and I

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:17.520
Ask if she watches aiden ross if she don't then you can tell her goodbye

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.920
I was so bad at keeping up with the

01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:28.240
Sam Smith if he was good really really

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.840
You're hilarious

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:39.840
I almost want to try again to see if I can do it better, but I feel like it's too cringe

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:47.040
Why am I here just to suffer? Yeah, you're here for me to to torture you with my zoomer tiktoks

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:49.520
You didn't have enough for this. I know I know

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:56.080
He did it way better. He had so much worse than me. This guy's singing isn't bad. Isn't bad. It's beautiful

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:05.360
Hello my microphone just randomly disconnected there. Uh

01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:08.800
That's weird

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:11.040
It was beautiful

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:13.760
I'm good now. I'm good now

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:16.880
At least I think I'm good now

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:20.480
Testing testing. I did not shart. I didn't mute to shart

01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:24.080
God had to mute

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:26.960
He was done with my fucking singing

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.360
I'm gonna show what it's supposed to look like

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:47.680
It's so cute too

01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.480
It's a little phallic shaped

01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:58.400
It's a sock

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:04.400
It looks like the inside out sock. Wait, I don't know what you're talking about. What if he sees in the toilet?

01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:13.920
I feel like this is what I would make if I ever tried to crochet it's a yellow tear

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:21.920
They really I mean if for a first time it I feel like it's pretty good. It's the banana cards

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:27.360
It's got it's got more personality to it, you know

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:33.040
Okay, show me your little treasure trove. Why is it so cute?

01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:45.840
She made like zombie noises and made the freaking unicorn on top eat. This is this is a

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:51.760
This is a little girl with a box full of cicada shells. I think it's cicada shells

01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:54.320
Sierra out of 10

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:56.960
Are you talking about this or the

01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:01.440
The bee this is a 10 out of 10. Look how cute she's even got her bracelets in there

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:06.560
She's got both both of her bracelets and her cicada shells

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.440
Like what a cutie patootie

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:15.280
Oh my god, there's an ant on my desk

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:19.360
This is 10 out of 10. Yeah

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:23.440
Okay, show me your little treasure. She's got personality. She's gonna go far in life

01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.240
I

01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.080
Can't get over how she like makes the unicorn chew on the show

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.520
I love the mexican people, especially the big girls

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:39.440
Las gorditas. They are so tasty. Ike Rico. They call me el viejo ascaroso

01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:47.360
Which is Spanish for the handsome orange man. In fact, the next big beautiful, uh, when I see I'll be grabbing her by the taco

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.320
Las gorditas

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:55.920
Thank you dirty test confirmed. No, I just have an ant problem

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:04.080
I'm sure it'll go away soon. I use like ant traps, but I can't tell if it's working or not

01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:08.080
Las gorditas, maybe my rats will just eat all the ants

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:15.440
I love the mexican people, especially the big girls las gorditas

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:21.200
They're so tasty. Ike Rico. Ike Rico. It's an AI voice. I'm pretty sure but it's so funny

01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:26.720
There's a dirty tip to find the best stuff when you find a really cute item like this vintage top

01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:29.120
Make sure there's not poop on

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:31.680
Make sure nobody pooped on

01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:34.080
the item

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:37.200
That's it. Just make sure there's no poop

01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:41.760
What a great what a great thrifting tip

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:45.520
I would have never I would have never guessed to do that

01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:50.320
I could have probably accidentally bought something with poop on it

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:54.480
10 out of 10 tips. Any other dead stuff?

01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:03.040
Find the best stuff when you find a really cute item like this vintage top make sure there's not poop on it

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:06.800
Make sure nobody pooped on the item

01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:10.640
How did they even get poop so high up on the shirt?

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:13.920
Like when you poop you poop your pants, not your shirt

01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:16.640
poop stream

01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:25.440
I would I don't watch coco melon you need to try harder if you want to torture me

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:29.040
I would gladly watch coco melon with my little sister. I don't watch coco melon

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.560
I watched my little pony though. That's not torture

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:36.560
It defies gravity. Oh, maybe it was tucked in you're right

01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:39.440
Explosive

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:45.600
Oh, this one's funny

01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:02.960
I didn't see it coming. I didn't see it coming at all. You don't get it

01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:11.200
You all are getting the color of your man's tipped paint on your nail

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:20.560
I didn't get it at first. I was like, why why are her nails white and sparkly? I don't get it and then she shut her man

01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:26.400
10 out of 10, thank you

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:30.400
Yeah, you got that his even his tip is sparkly

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:36.240
I've never genuinely I've never watched Twilight genuinely

01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:44.480
If I were to choose a team, I'd probably choose team edward just because I like vampires more than werewolves, but yeah

01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:47.920
He's got that pale sparkly head

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:56.160
Watch along do you guys want to watch along of dwilight? Are you guys interested in watching dwilight?

01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:58.160
Wait

01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:11.440
Doesn't he know what she's saying

01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:17.520
No, you don't want to watch twilight. Okay. Okay. Okay. We won't watch twilight. We won't watch twilight

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:24.080
No, I won't make you do that

01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:28.560
I

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:32.880
Love the nose going up and down is so funny so aggressive

01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:38.240
I love aggressive little cute things. I'm an aggressive little cute thing

01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:47.760
What does anyone know what is a Russian doesn't even know what she's saying

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.560
I need you guys to see in here

01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:04.480
10 out of 10 9.9. Why are you so suspicious specific about it? You know the nose or the eye

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:16.160
Context to this okay context to this so this is this is some random lady on tiktok that I follow

01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:21.520
I followed her because I genuinely thought her singing was good

01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:27.040
And I think that probably gives you an idea of how like bad I am at singing

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:30.320
Because I genuinely think this woman is good at singing like I think

01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:33.360
Like I can tell the song cover doesn't sound good

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:34.880
um

01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:38.240
In other people's ears, but I to me it's like

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:41.840
It's good to me

01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:44.660
You're gonna cringe. Oh, this is gonna be bad

01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:53.520
Everybody is disapproval

01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:02.080
If the heavens ever did see he's the last to mouth pee

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:04.480
Like she's good

01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:07.360
Is she not

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:15.120
Do you like this song I like this song, but i'm just saying like she's she's good, right?

01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:17.200
Absolutely

01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:23.280
It's not bad

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:28.000
I was born sick, but I love it

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:46.800
Take me to church

01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:55.280
Oh

01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:09.520
She said a minute really peak

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:17.920
She reminds me of Shakira with the way she sings I think this is a full song cover

01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:20.480
In the

01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:23.600
She sings like Shakira with the shaking of her voice

01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:32.080
It makes me uncomfortable just like church 10 out of 10 perfect. Yeah, she's pleading like a

01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:35.760
It's not in rhythm

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.480
That's a problem. I think it sounds good like

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:44.000
Shakira mugged. Yeah, Shakira who I only know this lady

01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:47.520
She has talent keeping

01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:54.560
Oh, this is so cute. This is genuinely so cute

01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:04.240
Oh, man, this like makes me cry

01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:11.600
Because it's so cute. Some of you probably think it's really disgusting and gross and dirty, but the bull

01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:14.560
Oh

01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:21.360
Like it's so wholesome I can't handle it

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:32.160
It's probably in New York City, you would see this crazy shit in New York like the bull 10 out of 10. Yes. Thank you

01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.120
I'm your rat

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:41.440
I feel kind of offended when people call me a rat because rats are like ugly to a lot of people

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
But this is a cute rat

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:50.720
I want to kiss it. I want to kiss it. Look at this distinguished gentleman

01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:53.680
Look at the way he is sitting. Yes

01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.680
Rats have ginormous balls

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:04.400
That's why I didn't want to get male rats because I didn't want their balls like running across my face

01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:06.560
While I'm sleeping and stuff

01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:09.040
Look at this distinguished gentleman

01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:12.480
Look at the way he is sitting. Yes, very

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:24.080
No, he wasn't eating the rat from the other video

01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:31.680
No, I didn't want their balls dragging across my face

01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:34.480
Is that too much to ask?

01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:44.640
Okay, this is funny because when I okay, so if you don't know

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:48.960
Um on tiktok, there's these like, um

01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:52.640
What's it called?

01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:57.120
There's like these fortune teller women that will randomly appear on your for you page and they'll be like

01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:04.800
This video has no hashtags. It was meant to find you and then they'll do like some tarot card pulls to like, I don't know

01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:12.240
Tell you your future or tell you like you're going to meet the love of your life in

01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:17.200
Five days something like that, right? So this is I got this

01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:23.760
I got this specific tiktok like right before we were gonna debut. So I thought it was really funny

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:27.200
Your partner wants to drink your squirt this weekend

01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:30.320
Yep

01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:34.480
Yeah, you heard me on that one. Um, they have been thinking about this all week

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:41.360
And they're ready for that rain splash, right? Uh, a little bit of a cancer on this one and I am getting a capricorn

01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:45.040
Whatever

01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:49.120
Anyway, yeah, your partner has been basically so he knew backwards because we have this obama snow here, right?

01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:54.800
We're talking about this double edge. He was not wrong. I understand that this might be the means to be drinking that squirt

01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:59.520
Yeah, right, maybe that's gonna have like a three to four hours session where they do that, right?

01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:02.160
Where we're doing a little bit of a double edge. It's kind of goes both ways

01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:08.320
Which is stunning and then of course lastly, I did get the uh beautiful card here that does have a mega drain

01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:11.040
so, yeah, there's

01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:17.520
I will say uh hydrate maybe get some liquid ivy or something like that because I will say that this is going to be buckets in buckets of

01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:23.760
Squirt and I'm gonna resonate all over the place. There's gonna be resonation everywhere and I'm wishing nothing but the best for you guys

01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:25.760
This is this is

01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:28.800
It was meant to find me. I don't know what these are

01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:32.560
I don't know what these numbers are on the screen. They're not hentai codes. Are they?

01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:40.640
10 out of 10 bakey

01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:43.840
True in real

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.640
There's no such thing. Yeah, there's a stuff like this. There's no such thing as a coincidence

01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:53.920
This video was meant to find you your partner wants to drink your squirt this week

01:52:55.840 --> 01:53:03.200
It can't be hentai. Okay. I don't know what these numbers are. Maybe they're could they be the numbers to the these cards do do pokemon cards have

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
numbers

01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:08.480
Oh, they're fake lucky numbers. Is that what they are?

01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:18.160
What are hentai codes? Uh-oh, you're a little bit too innocent to be here. If you don't know that

01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:24.400
How many buckets he just said buckets of end buckets I think

01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:28.400
Can we can we drink my squirt?

01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:31.920
Gladly

01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:37.920
Oh, this is the fucking guy. Oh, I love this video so much. Okay, you're not fucking ready

01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:40.800
I want us to be together forever

01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:44.480
How are we gonna do that?

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:54.640
Oh god, john. God, john. Thank you. Thank you. I can feel you inside of me. Me too, thank you

01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:58.320
It feels amazing

01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:01.280
Amazing

01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:03.280
And you layer those two boys

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Gotcha

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:13.520
I've literally been roleplaying like this alone ever since I found this freaking dude. I'll just be alone talking to myself and I'll be like

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:16.320
catch

01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:22.640
Oh god, I'm so I'm so sorry

01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:30.080
Yes

01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:33.280
This is what this is what my sly face is where it's gonna be like

01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:40.080
I may have gotten it stuck in the hair. There it is again. Daku. I told you to not aim for my hair

01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:44.800
I'm sorry. Gotcha. I was just I was so caught up in the moment

01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:49.520
Oh, this stuff is never gonna wash out

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:53.760
You know, kachan, they actually say it's good for your hair and might make it grow longer

01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:57.120
Shut up. Daku. That's just a myth

01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:02.640
If people see this in my hair, they're gonna know something's up between us. Oh, yeah, you're right

01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:06.320
Come on. Help me clean it up. Okay

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:15.120
If I hear kachan whispering into ASMR mic, I'll invert you'll invert, huh?

01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:19.600
Wait

01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:23.680
I forgot to make my mic mono. Hopefully nothing

01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:26.640
Was fucking up, um

01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:32.480
The chat's there from made a mistake with the hair. I'm guessing he got slime in his hair probably

01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:37.440
Damn Deku you got it all in my hair

01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:48.480
I don't know if you relate to this but I've done this now. Okay

01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:52.720
I didn't stream my pussy, but I did

01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:57.360
At one point I used my phone camera to look at it

01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:03.680
And I didn't realize that for some reason it had gone to the instagram camera

01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:08.400
Like you know how I'm pretty sure instagram has like a built-in camera

01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:11.120
It went to that

01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:15.280
And I didn't realize that and then I when I did realize that I was like, holy shit

01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:17.520
or maybe

01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:21.680
No, I think what happened was I was I wanted to take a picture of my kuchi to like look at it

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:25.760
And and I didn't realize that I used the instagram camera

01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:30.160
So I took a picture of it and then when I looked back on my phone. I was like, wait, what's this overlay?

01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:34.560
What happened? I took a picture with the instagram camera. I never posted it disgusting where

01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:41.040
That's disgusting. What what is this instagram account called? Where can I find this?

01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:43.840
So I can make sure to to avoid it

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:48.320
No, I didn't post it. I did not post it

01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:51.120
This one's what he did

01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:00.720
Is this from the new planet of the apes is that what it's called?

01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:05.200
Proof or it didn't happen shut up

01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:10.400
Is this from that new movie because I see a lot of these

01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:15.360
Yeah, I love this meme format too. I see a lot of this format when there's no sweets in the back of the

01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:19.920
Just some I like I was British brick brick top naked bloke

01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:24.640
Looks like it don't donation

01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:29.040
For $100,000. I'll show my pussy

01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:35.360
I remember I remember when I lost my mind

01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:37.360
I

01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:51.360
Don't take that seriously. I won't actually do that. Don't do that. Don't don't take that seriously

01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:00.960
It looks like 11 from stranger things

01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:03.440
Ah

01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:07.040
It's such a sexy song too

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:14.080
And they were like, let me do this. This is perfect. This is so fitting for this sexy asshole

01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:21.520
Chat makes a yeah, if he makes a joke chat makes a promise you really want that that picture, huh?

01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:23.520
So

01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:33.440
We did the drawing challenge and then we decided to draw this dog. This is mine

01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:35.680
Cute cute

01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:51.920
Oh my god, you guys are really taking me seriously with the with the the kuchi picture

01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:59.680
I see that next to my bed. Yeah, that's literally your sleeper. That's like a sleeper

01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:02.080
Assistant

01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:08.640
I don't understand. Why did she give it like human nostrils and a human mouth?

01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:15.600
She should hang that picture on the wall. No, it's gonna stare at her while she sleeps

01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:18.960
It's gonna come out of the picture and like freaking

01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:22.160
Sleep paralysis demon her

01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:36.960
The next meme wait, that's all the memes. Oh, never mind. There is no next meme. That's all the memes

01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:46.480
You might go mute it again, I think it's because I I think it's because I

01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:51.920
No, I might go mute it again. I think it's because I keep accidentally kicking the wire

01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:58.320
And also my chat broke again

01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:01.680
I

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:06.560
Talks check

02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:17.280
You need more memes, I'm glad you guys like the brain rot memes. They were really brain rot. I know especially the deku stuff

02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:21.040
I just I just think the deku stuff is funny

02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:23.840
kachan

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.680
Thank you for liking my memes kachan. I really appreciate it

02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:32.400
So

02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:36.720
Maybe maybe we could do this again kachan shut up baka

02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:40.880
Damn idiot

02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:43.120
Okay, I'm actually starting to cringe at myself now

02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:46.080
Dekeli is the one next time

02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:51.200
I can't do ear licking. So I'll just torture you torture you with dekeli is the one

02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:57.600
I had the dekeli voice

02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:06.400
Don't worry. Don't worry kachan. I don't know how to I feel like if I try too hard, I can't do it

02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:10.720
I'm sorry kachan. I won't get it in your hair again. I'm sorry

02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:17.200
We need to wear galvanized square steels. That's true. I had it in the thumbnail here

02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:20.240
We can we can watch one galvanized square steel video

02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:23.120
Oh

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Let me find one

02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:43.520
I don't know if these are like the actual video or is this some kind of video essay

02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:46.160
Sometimes I need to paraphrase

02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:50.080
It's easy to make your work clear. Sorry. You're just listening to an ad with me

02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:56.480
The galvanized steel and eco-friendly would be near me. Oh, shut up. Don't explain the meme to me. I want to see the meme

02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:05.520
Okay, I found one

02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:08.080
No, that's not a right thing

02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:12.560
Uh this one

02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:15.920
Damn baka

02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:19.280
Okay, oh shit

02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:22.240
Do

02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:28.640
You like the way I flick my tongue or not or not

02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:35.040
You can ride you can ride my face until you drip and come the new one square meter room in new york

02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:37.280
Little john worked hard for 10 years

02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:41.280
Saved up two million dollars to buy a house, but it was barely bigger than a square meter

02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:44.640
Even his little cat couldn't fit inside his little cat for the cheapest hammock

02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:47.760
Ultimately, he couldn't handle the cramped space and had to renovate it

02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:52.480
He starts by removing the original windows and replaces them with a galvanized square steel frame

02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:55.760
Yeah, forced with horizontal and vertical wells for extra strength

02:02:55.840 --> 02:03:00.160
He spends his last bit of pocket money on expansion screws to securely attach it to the wall

02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:05.600
A top mounted pull down storage cabinet is installed nearly nearly as much as galvanized

02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:07.920
What's galvanized even mean?

02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:13.280
All covered with environmentally friendly solid wood boards for durability on top of the wooden boards

02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:16.080
He places a folder he's really living on the edge here

02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:21.040
Big enough for him and his girlfriend to sleep on together. It's also easy to put away when not needed

02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:23.120
He installs window guard. Oh, there we go

02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:27.920
Lifting the cover reveals additional storage space for things like suitcases

02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:32.960
Well, he's really smart with his with his galvanized square steel. No, not the toilet!

02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:39.440
Not the fucking toilet, ew. Okay, back to just chatting

02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:41.840
Oh

02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:50.000
It's coating on the steel a very thin layer of zinc. Why would I have a thin layer of zinc on me? I'm not galvanized

02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:57.680
Okay, well

02:03:58.160 --> 02:03:59.840
Thank you for

02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:02.880
Here is anyone else streaming? I should probably wait

02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:06.880
You can run my face until you're dripping cold

02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:11.200

02:04:57.360 --> 02:04:59.360
Caps

02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:06.720
Oh, okay, sorry about that. I mean it didn't mean to scare you. Just a little magic trick that I learned recently

02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:12.800
Uh, how do I look at the poor results? Okay

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:15.680
Um

02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:19.840
It looks like most of you want to go with uh sheebie, so we'll go with sheebie then

02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:23.120
Yeah, youtube studio

02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:29.200
God reading is so much shittier on youtube. I'll never stop shitting on youtube

02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:32.480
For their shitty streams be direct

02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:35.840
Sheebie, okay

02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:41.600
Okay, thank you for coming. I'll see you tomorrow. I think tomorrow's another ASMR stream

02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:50.080
Just practicing my necromancy just decapitated myself real quick to see if I would survive that

02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:56.000
A little test, you know, trying really hard to get you back. All right. You guys wanted an

02:05:56.800 --> 02:05:58.800
Oni-chan for me

02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:02.400
I haven't practiced that. I haven't even said it once in an audio

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.160
Oh oni-chan. Oh that's cringe

02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:12.240
I feel like because I can't speak Japanese it sounds it sounds cringe oni oni-chan

02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:15.440
I'll stick to big brother. I'm sorry

02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:21.360
I'll stick to big brother. I feel like too much of a too much of a cringe weave if I say oni-chan

02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:28.080
Maybe if I'm doing like a full-on roleplay I might do it. How about that if I do a full-on like

02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:31.200
roleplay stream

02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:36.640
Then it wouldn't be as bad because it's it's like fully roleplay and I can immerse myself

02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:41.680
You're welcome 10 out of 10 cringe. You're welcome oni-chan

02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:44.480
Okay

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:53.440
Um, I'll see you tomorrow with ASMR again. Uh, yeah, bye. Bye

02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:13.680
