05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Not about being stinky, though.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
But it's my favorite stench.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Sure, you're a general pervert to most women in town.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
You dress like you're homeless.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
You went to juvie twice before the age of 12.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
But they're all wrong about you.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
All of them.

05:49.000 --> 05:56.000
Every single cop, and priest, and guidance counselor, and medical professional, and fast food cashier.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
All the funny pranks we used to do

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
are big big heists

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
are

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
knights together.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Aw, I miss them.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
I know it's been a while since I last saw you.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
I'm sorry.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
You might not care,

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
but mom and dad stopped talking about you for a while now.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
They act like you never existed.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
They smile a lot more now,

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
as if they didn't see what I saw.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
So, I left them.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
I don't need them anyway.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
When I have you back,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
all we'll need is each other.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
And they don't even know I found your book,

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
so they don't know that I can bring you back.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
I don't want to mess it up like,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
last time,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
and the time before that.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
But don't make fun of me.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I was new at it,

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
so I'm gonna be a big pro

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
before I bring back my big bro.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Oh, right.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Last time we talked,

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
you said someone was keeping you from coming back.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
Well, that's what I figured between all your screaming.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
You were probably a pro at this magical stuff, huh, big bro?

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Which means they must be real nasty

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
to be able to keep you from coming back.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I'm still starting out,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
so I make lots of mistakes.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
But I'm not scared.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
I've been practicing all over town.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I'm leveling up so I can smash the final boss

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
as soon as I see them.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
And then I'll find them, got them,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
bring you back, and then we can...

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Everything will be perfect.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Yeah.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I don't care who it is.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
A ghost? An angel?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Or even the devil herself.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
You're gonna be back home again.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
And we can finally...

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I hope you can still hear me.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
No, I know you can.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I know you'd do the same for me.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
So never think that I'll quit.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
I'll tear through Hell and Earth myself if I have to.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
I'll practice and practice and practice.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
And when I'm the perfect woman for you,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I will take you home.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Wait for me.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I'll see you later, big bro.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Hey, you. You're finally awake.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
You were trying to cross the border, right?

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Blocked right into that Imperial ambush.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Seems us.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
I wonder what you're doing.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Hello? Oh my goodness!

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Hello, hello, hello, welcome!

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Did you enjoy Mercy's dream?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
And Azura's dream?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
And Icy's dream?

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
It's nice to see you're still in one piece after Mercy,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
because, you know,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
after you're done with me,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
there won't be anything left of you big brother.

yah..I was الفندانز

17:27.800 --> 17:30.680
look at you, you are so smart

17:30.780 --> 17:31.880
O.K

17:31.880 --> 17:39.880
Let's move on to this next room. Up here, I have my rat room.

17:39.880 --> 17:45.880
That's right, I got four rats. I can already see the memes in chat.

17:45.880 --> 17:51.880
Rats, I was rats once. They left me in a room full of crazy.

17:51.880 --> 17:55.880
And crazy makes me rats. Okay, yeah, yeah, I have four rats.

17:55.880 --> 17:59.880
Now, obviously, I don't want to break your immersion here a little bit.

17:59.880 --> 18:03.880
But they don't look like this in real life.

18:03.880 --> 18:07.880
Okay, I know it's hard to tell, but we are in Minecraft right now.

18:07.880 --> 18:15.880
So you will see them for real in real life IRL during my hand cam streams.

18:15.880 --> 18:21.880
Yeah, I'm going to try to have them out during hand cam streams so you can formally meet them.

18:21.880 --> 18:27.880
Okay, so right across this beam here, I have my bedroom.

18:28.880 --> 18:32.880
I mean, the red paint on the floor.

18:32.880 --> 18:40.880
So I also have these plushies next to my bed, you know, the plushies I hold while I cry myself to sleep, the five nights up for these plushies.

18:40.880 --> 18:45.880
And over here is my little desk with my pewter.

18:45.880 --> 18:50.880
Yeah, this is my computer. This is literally where I am streaming from right now.

18:50.880 --> 18:56.880
This is where I tweet from. Okay, and here I have my steam library open.

18:57.880 --> 19:07.880
So, okay, I know some of you might feel a little scared right now looking at these games, you know, you see, oh fuck, Valorant, League of Legends.

19:07.880 --> 19:11.880
She's a loser, she's a loser version, what the fuck.

19:11.880 --> 19:15.880
No, I'm not a gamer, okay, your sister is not a gamer.

19:15.880 --> 19:20.880
So don't don't look at these games and be like, oh man, that's so disappointing.

19:20.880 --> 19:25.880
I will be playing that many games, but these are the games that I want to try eventually.

19:27.880 --> 19:31.880
Will I even get to all of them? I don't even know.

19:31.880 --> 19:43.880
I don't even know if I'll get to all of these because, like I said before, most of my streams will mostly be made up of me dicking around, like doing challenges, doing like DIY stuff, like handcams.

19:43.880 --> 19:48.880
Just, you'll see during my schedule, you'll see, I mostly just dick around.

19:48.880 --> 19:53.880
Okay, so here on this blackboard, I have my goals. Yep, I've written down my goals.

19:53.880 --> 19:58.880
So my first goal and the most important goal is to not give up.

19:58.880 --> 20:04.880
I'm a very fragile soul, okay, if you leave one hate comment, I'm fucking leaving, I'm ending stream.

20:04.880 --> 20:17.880
Okay, but for real, I give up on things super easily, I have a lot of abandoned hobby equipment in my room because I always give up on stuff.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.880
So yeah, I don't want to give up.

20:20.880 --> 20:23.880
Next, I want to experiment with lots of different types of content.

20:23.880 --> 20:33.880
So a lot of ASMR tropes, I want to try clip calculations, I want to try making memes, I even want to try singing, oh fuck.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.880
Okay, we'll move on, I'll come back to that.

20:40.880 --> 20:44.880
I want to do a 3D debut, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm really excited for a 3D debut.

20:45.880 --> 20:57.880
I want to touch the other Violaire girls in 3D, I want to sniff their booties, I want to grope them, you know, basically everything you've ever wanted to do to them, I'll be able to do for you in VR.

20:59.880 --> 21:12.880
Fourth is I want to make you happy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, my ultimate goal is to entertain you, you know, to make you laugh and to suck and fuck you.

21:14.880 --> 21:22.880
Okay, we're done here in my room, let me go down here, and let me go to my kitchen.

21:23.880 --> 21:43.880
Okay, I'm not a cook, if you ever do get cooking streams from me, it will be very scuffed, I have lit up a cake on fire, I've lit up a fish on fire, I'm really not a cook, but maybe I can show you my favorite food, you know, the kind of stuff I like to eat, maybe you can cook for me.

21:44.880 --> 21:52.880
Oh, I, okay, oops, so it looks like I forgot to go grocery shopping before this.

21:54.880 --> 22:10.880
Listen, some people might consider it an alcohol addiction, I am simply prioritizing my hydration, yeah, every time you tell me to drink during stream, just know I will be drinking vodka.

22:10.880 --> 22:16.880
And, oh, don't even worry about that one.

22:17.880 --> 22:19.880
Okay, here's my living room.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.880
Yup, this is my living room, this is where I do all my jorgen.

22:24.880 --> 22:33.880
Over here's my TV with a notflix open, and no other streaming service I use notflix.

22:33.880 --> 22:42.880
So, on the top row is my favorite shows and my favorite movies, and then on the bottom row is my favorite anime.

22:43.880 --> 22:54.880
So, my favorite shows, I really, really like kids' cartoons, like old kids' cartoons, so I like My Little Pony, I like Adventure Time, I like Gunball, I like Gravity Falls.

22:55.880 --> 23:03.880
I rewatch all those shows back to back constantly, and then my favorite movies are Pearl and Gone Girl.

23:04.880 --> 23:17.880
So, if you've ever watched those movies and you might think badly of me, or maybe you're afraid of me because I like those movies, good, you should be.

23:17.880 --> 23:18.880
Okay, moving on.

23:18.880 --> 23:24.880
So, my favorite anime is Freerun, Dungeon Messi, Psyche is a huge comfort anime of mine.

23:25.880 --> 23:29.880
Watamote, the main character is literally me, she is me.

23:30.880 --> 23:37.880
I really like Hellsman Castle and Maiden Abyss, and there's... Breaking Bad at the bottom.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.880
That wasn't even supposed to be there.

23:41.880 --> 23:49.880
Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry, would you look at that, my coffee table is such a mess, oh fuck.

23:50.880 --> 23:58.880
Oh, I picked up some pages on my coffee table, it looks like the rats must have been messing with my stuff because apparently they ripped up my diary.

23:59.880 --> 24:00.880
How rude of them.

24:01.880 --> 24:07.880
Well, I guess I can open up to you a little bit and show you my thoughts, my feelings.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.880
Oh, I wrote my first impressions here, okay.

24:12.880 --> 24:18.880
So, for Messi, she's very social, she knows a lot of people, like holy crap, and she's also very sweet.

24:19.880 --> 24:24.880
And her laugh is insane, when I first heard her laugh, I was like, god damn, holy crap, I got scared.

24:25.880 --> 24:36.880
Next is, I see she's god's ebius soldier, a lot of our meetings have been at night, and she's also effortlessly cute, like Oliver, like I heard her yawn once and I was like, god damn, I have to try to be cute, okay?

24:37.880 --> 24:41.880
All of this cuteness you see in front of you is like practiced, but I see it doesn't even have to fucking try.

24:42.880 --> 24:56.880
Strani is super super caring, and she's also a non-stop gamer, and yeah, I don't know how she plays games for so long, like, it couldn't be me, I'm jealous, I want to sit down and play for that long, but I can't.

24:58.880 --> 25:06.880
Next is, she's super funny, she's very hyper, you might not notice that she's hyper during her debut, but once you get to know her more, yeah.

25:07.880 --> 25:17.880
She's also very good at voice impressions, we were watching a stream together, and she copied the streamer's voice, and I was so surprised because I couldn't tell if it was she be talking or the streamer.

25:18.880 --> 25:29.880
And finally we have Azura, Azura is super super chill, she's also good at a lot of games, all the like community games we played together, she like, won all of them.

25:30.880 --> 25:38.880
And her voice is just pure sex, every word she says, she just moans it, I don't know how she does it.

25:39.880 --> 25:48.880
Alright, so before we end, let me turn the camera back onto myself, and I can show you my model, yup.

25:50.880 --> 25:55.880
Okay, are you ready? I'll show you some of my toggles, okay, okay, okay.

25:55.880 --> 26:03.880
So first I have this, you know, little shy arm pose, you know, when I'm feeling shy, oo-woo.

26:04.880 --> 26:13.880
I have these love eyes, POV, I'm standing above you while you're sleeping, and watching you sleep.

26:14.880 --> 26:23.880
Okay, I have an exclamation point, I have this one, we'll look past that one, that's for different streams, not for YouTube streams.

26:23.880 --> 26:34.880
I can cry, sadge, I can be stupid, I mean I'm always stupid, but I can look stupid too.

26:35.880 --> 26:41.880
I can drool, I bet you want to lick that off of my mouth, don't you?

26:41.880 --> 26:54.880
I can blush, I can be angry, you don't want to get on my bad side, I'll punish you.

26:55.880 --> 27:09.880
I can be scared, and double scared, and also sweaty, I bet you want to lick my sweat too, I've been reading your comments, I know.

27:09.880 --> 27:14.880
I can sleep, look at you, watching me sleep.

27:15.880 --> 27:22.880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I can take off my jacket, there it is, and you know what else I can take off?

27:23.880 --> 27:26.880
You're never going to guess, are you ready for this?

27:27.880 --> 27:33.880
What could it be, could it be my shorts, could it be my shirt, could it be, could it be, oh it's my shoes.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.880
I can take my shoes off, and I can stomp on you.

27:38.880 --> 27:41.880
Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, okay.

27:42.880 --> 27:45.880
Oh, I think I missed one toggle.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.880
Is it this one?

27:50.880 --> 27:52.880
There we go, I can cast spells.

27:52.880 --> 27:57.880
Shadow, what is it, Shadow, Wizard Money Gang.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.880
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

28:00.880 --> 28:05.880
Enough glooping around, let's go to my schedule, here is my schedule for next week.

28:06.880 --> 28:15.880
Yeah, so tomorrow we have a debut, but don't forget about me just yet because I'll see you at the collab stream after this, okay?

28:16.880 --> 28:25.880
And then Monday we have an ASMR stream, Tuesday I will be showing you my favorite TikToks, it's basically like a meme review except you're the one that's reviewing the memes and I'm the one showing you the memes.

28:26.880 --> 28:40.880
And then Poppy Playtime, and then another ASMR stream, and then I, listen, I didn't make the schedule, I don't know who wrote my life story, I've never played the coffin of Andy and Lay Lay before, but apparently it pertains to me somehow.

28:41.880 --> 28:54.880
And then after that we're gonna be making Pop and Cookin', which is like a, it's like a DIY candy, and then after that I'm gonna try to guess characters without my glasses because fun fact I'm actually incredibly blind.

28:55.880 --> 28:57.880
Well because I'm like video game characters and stuff.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.880
Alright, now.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.880
I want you to come buckets right now.

29:03.880 --> 29:04.880
What, did you hear that?

29:04.880 --> 29:06.880
Fucking pull out your cock.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.880
What, what is that?

29:08.880 --> 29:10.880
I want you to come buckets right now.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.880
That voice sounds familiar, doesn't it?

29:12.880 --> 29:19.880
I think it sounds like a bunny, and I think she's trying to lead us down the rabbit hole into Wonderland.

29:20.880 --> 29:24.880
Maybe, maybe you should follow her, follow her voice, yeah.

29:24.880 --> 29:27.880
And I'll see you again in the collab stream, okay?

29:28.880 --> 29:29.880
Goodbye.

29:54.880 --> 29:55.880
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
