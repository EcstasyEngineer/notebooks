0	17140	Psst, yo. Yeah, you dumbass. You got $100 on ya? Um, cuz I need it. I can do something
17140	30820	in return, mister. I'm a good girl. I can, like, offer my services. What kind? Eh, good
30820	41500	question. Let me think. Well, we're in this dark and dingy alleyway, in a scrupulous part
41500	50380	of town, so the only logical thing that I can do in return for an exchange of money is...
50380	61380	ASMR, of course. Duh. Well, come on. If you've got the cash, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
61380	67180	I mean, who else is gonna offer you it? Are you telling me there's cute and funny girls
67180	74420	throwing themselves at you to tingle you? Exactly. So hurry up and hand it over already.
74420	87980	I love people who make it easy. Thanks. Um, alright. Let's see what I have on me that I can use to
87980	99980	make you tingle. Hmm. Oh, this'll do. It's my little plastic tube. You know that whole thing
99980	107060	where girls like cute small things? It's true. Like stationery, for example. The smaller the
107060	113100	cuter, and thus the better. That's why I have this little plastic paper clip holder.
117980	145620	Okay. Now ain't over. You're too tall for me to do this one.
207980	226620	Alright, so if each tingle is worth $5, then I only need to do this. 1, 2, 3, 4, 18 more times.
226620	235220	Oh, what? I don't even have enough things with me to do that. I'm gonna have to get really creative
235220	245020	with this. Oh, there's a glass bottle in the ground. What? Don't give me that look. It's
245020	254060	good to be resourceful. You know that, right? See? I can make do with this ear to ear. You
254060	279060	can't tell me that's not tingle ready with a straight face.
279060	299340	I could bite joke you? What? It's a tingle. I swear it is. Do you not want YouTube videos
299340	307900	or something? Goth roleplays are pretty popular at the moment. It's your $100. If you don't
307900	314900	want it, then fine. I'll think of something else. Ha, got ya.
337900	359900	Some cotton balls came out of my voodoo doll recently. I can repurpose it for now.
419900	426900	And if you enjoyed that sound, I can also do this too.
450900	458900	Then there's the super basic stuff like finger flittering. It's a bit boring, but I can mix
458900	461900	in some ear tapping too.
479900	507900	Oh, you have a request? And what would that be, mister? Of course I can run my fingers
507900	515900	through your hair. You made me nervous thinking it was something a little more explicit that
537900	565900	I do have tissues. I could try this. Have you been keeping count, by the way? I was starting
565900	572900	to lose track of how long I've been doing this for.
595900	615900	Maybe you like the sound of scratching? Yeah, like that. What do you think? It's good, right?
655900	678900	I suppose I can take my pins out to brush through your hair as well, but only because
678900	683900	you didn't make a fuss when handing over the money. You'd be surprised how many people
683900	686900	only want to pay me after the service.
743900	751900	Um, not to alarm you or anything, but you're starting to slouch over now. I think you're
751900	761900	passing out. You want more? Are you sure you can even handle more, though? I have a few
761900	768900	more things I could do then, but I'm going to need to get going soon.
791900	814900	This is the last one, sadly, but I'm really thankful for your business. You never know.
814900	818900	If you walk through here again, we could do this, and I'll actually be more prepared next
818900	825900	time, but I'll be quiet while you enjoy this last one.
848900	877900	I have to get going now, but thanks again for your patronage. Maybe I'll see you again
877900	887900	next time. Good night, mister.
