1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,340
the

2
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,340
You

3
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,340
You

4
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,460
You

5
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,660
Hope oh, I didn't realize my mic was on. Hi

6
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,440
Hello, hello, does someone explain to me why I

7
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,680
Have a diet I have a can of diet coke here

8
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,380
Why is it fizzing?

9
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:02,900
Like it like for some reason I put a metal straw in here earlier and it's fizzing like crazy and then I put I

10
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,540
put a paper straw in here and

11
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,100
It fizzes like crazy too

12
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,420
But when I take the straws out it stops fizzing

13
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,140
No, but every time I take the straw out it stops fizzing. It's the straw

14
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:22,400
See it's starting to fizz again after I put the straw back in

15
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,200
It's only the straw that's making it fizz I

16
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,720
Don't understand no I'm using a paper straw now

17
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:45,100
See I know you can't see but oops hold on I have to delete the text. I know you can't see but like

18
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:53,460
Paper straws are nasty. Well, it was fizzing crazy more with the metal straw. At least it's not fizzing as much with the paper straw

19
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,260
The straws have a lot of nucleation points

20
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,460
Nucleation points

21
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,340
Okay, well, it's not bad for me, right?

22
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,700
It's a sign that there's poison in the can no

23
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,820
We need our smartest pin pals on this. Yeah, it only fizzes when I have the straw in

24
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,340
I'm eating

25
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,340
Provolone cheese with them. I

26
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,660
Don't know some random salami. I don't think I like provolone cheese. I

27
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,060
Kind of taste like cheese farts

28
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,700
You know what I mean

29
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,460
And it's so thick like why is it so thick

30
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,540
It's the one I got was too thick it's too thick for my sandwiches on let me give some to the rats

31
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,540
So that way it's nice thick on my sandwich

32
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,420
One second, I'm just gonna give a bunch of cheese to the rats

33
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,700
I

34
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
I

35
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,740
So cute they're all fighting for the cheese I

36
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,660
Gave them all I gave them each like a piece of cheese, but they're all fighting each other for each other's cheeses

37
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,540
Maybe someone farted on that particular piece. No

38
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,500
Carbon dioxide forming bubbles on the micro holes in the surface of the straw

39
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,600
Hmm, okay

40
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,220
This sounds very scientific, I didn't know

41
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,940
Oh

42
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,340
There goes my tracking

43
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,460
The usual

44
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Um

45
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,860
The usual stream scuff of course

46
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,540
Reckoning me

47
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,020

48

Thank you, I like them a lot. I wear this outfit every time I play lizards 101

49
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,020
Wait, that's the wrong thing

50
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,100
There we go, there's my face again

51
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,380
You like seeing me in her natural habitat of scuff do the other girls have scuff

52
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,060
Be honest, am I the only scuff one be honest?

53
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,660
What where's my tracking go again, what the fuck I

54
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,660

00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,780
No, no manually breathing

176
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,220
He had if you like flame princess and the hunters yeah, he had flame princess for a while

177
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,420
He had like some sort of relationship

178
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:12,820
He kind of fucked up the flame princess one himself though, and then fucking sit up and bun took over

179
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,980
There we go now it's back

180
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,940
Remember watching the episodes where bubblegum had Marceline's old shirt still with her and my kids self immediately said dang

181
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,500
They gay as hell. Yeah, I like it

182
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,580
He's just like me for real

183
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,420
No

184
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,460
None of them stayed forever no, but that's okay

185
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,260
Nothing lasts forever depression sadness

186
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,020
I

187
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,380
Me open

188
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,380
Let me open them wizard 101 I

189
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:19,900
Love what what they did with ice kings character in that show he starts off so goofy and not serious

190
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
But then became like the most depressing character in the show

191
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:30,540
He does become the most depressing character, but I like him as a character. I have a crush on ice king

192
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,020
I'll be honest. I have a crush on ice king, but if I was Betty, I probably would have still left him

193
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,300
Sorry

194
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:45,740
It's true. I would have still left him even if I would even even even if I was Betty just because of their story

195
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,700
Fuck I forgot my password again

196
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,860
I

197
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,380
Okay, hold on

198
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,140
No

199
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,060
Okay, now I got it ice king or Simon that's the same person

200
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,340
That's the same person

201
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,780
If I got cooked by cinnamon bun, I'd give up on

202
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:26,700
Do you know the war behind cinnamon bun like cinnamon bun was stupid up until he went until the ice king into the ice kingdom

203
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,700
Because he was undercooked and then when he not ice king the fire kingdom or what's it called?

204
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
I think it was the flame flame kingdom

205
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,900
Because he was undercooked and that's why he was stupid

206
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:45,660
Having a lot of loves and all of them end with a heartbreak would tear a man apart

207
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,020
Finn went through so many more

208
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,940
Then went through so many more crazy things than just like

209
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,340
Breakups

210
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:14,100
That was definitely what tore him apart more I would say then a girl leaving him

211
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,980
Who is this cute witch? Where's Amy? I've replaced Amy today

212
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,700
I'm the mean Amy and I cast testicular torsion

213
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,060
Whoosh

214
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,900
You noted it down, what did I note down

215
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,380
Y'all remember the Hall of Egress stuff that would mess up me that wouldn't mess with me more than any breakup

216
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,380
It's Hall of Egress when he like

217
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,740
Got he was blind. He was like trapped in a maze for like days or something. I

218
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,460
Still get lich as it's on my tiktok

219
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,540
Yeah, he lost an arm his dad betrayed him his fucking sword

220
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:12,700
even his like grass sword became conscious and became him and then had a hoax the existential crisis a

221
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,020
Bunch of shit happened

222
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,820
Your password you noted it down your password. Oh, well, I

223
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,100
Forgot I noted it down, but I remembered it with my brain

224
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,340
Finn stuff with his dad and with friend was way more messed up than girl trouble. Yeah

225
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,460
Finn went through a lot of crazy shit

226
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,580
But it's a kid's show so you know

227
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,020
Let me change

228
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,180
Yeah, and Jake died too, unfortunately

229
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,180
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do that's the wrong thing

230
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,340
Hello, I

231
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,780
Don't want to catch

232
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,700
There we go

233
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,580
Jake died. Yeah, you didn't know that Jake died

234
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:40,580
Finn needs therapy now he's got his vault. He just puts everything in the vault just like me honestly, I do the same thing

235
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,140
Everything goes in the vault

236
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:56,100
It was truly an adventure time it was is my favorite show I still watch it a lot

237
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,100
No

238
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:08,420
That's one of the thing I like about the Steven Universe sequel it's literally just Steven has PTSD it now

239
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,220
Does he I never watch Steven Universe actually

240
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,420
If you like Fiona and cake show I

241
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:24,220
Feel like the Fiona and cake show had a whole lot of young adults loving the show because we all had jobs

242
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:28,860
We hid and we wish we could go on adventures. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It was um

243
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,620
Relatable especially Fiona's like shitty ugly apartment

244
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,180
That's really messy it was relatable

245
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,260
That's how my apartment looked when I had a job that I hated

246
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,780
It was rough

247
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,780
I

248
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Mean start the game

249
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,100
Now apparently I

250
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,620
Was notified that they had like free

251
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:12,940
Subscriptions through the weekend or some weekend I never logged in during that time

252
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,820
So

253
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,460
Pee-pee-pee I didn't get anything for free

254
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,580
Unfortunately

255
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:28,380
If your nose apartment still looked better than mine. Yeah, it was still aesthetically pleasing to it was messy, but it was still nice

256
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,580
Okay

257
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,140
Sorry, I know I'm burping a little more than usual or am I

258
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,220

260

You can still redeem some goodies on their side if you want some free pulls

262
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,220
Free pulls is this a gotcha game? What do you mean free pulls?

263
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,140
Why can't I?

264
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,940
Where am I going?

265
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,380
What wait what where's this leading me to?

266
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:15,540
What am I supposed to jump down? I can't

267
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,020
Is this someone's like oh

268
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,660
I have no friends in this game

269
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:33,660
How do I how do I get down get down there am I supposed to go from the other side

270
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:41,260
Wait, how do I get back up from here all the stairs the

271
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,660
Portal the

272
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,380
Portal

273
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,620
There's a portal

274
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,660
Which portal

275
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:02,060
They done gotcha fried wizard 101 they did I mean it was always like oh there we go

276
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,100
It was always really pay to play

277
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:14,060
You can get mounts and such from packs. Oh, that's where the gotcha stuff is okay

278
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,340
Okay

279
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,660
So this way wait, I feel like I just went backwards

280
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,740
Why does it say there's more space in between me and the it

281
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,060
Think I just went backward

282
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,060
backwards

283
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,560
Even in games the rich get richer

284
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,940
Unfortunately, oh fuck off damn it

285
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,660
Sometimes I walk straight into these bitches and they don't even see me and then sometimes I

286
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:53,180
Like stay as far away as possible from them and they still like fuck me up

287
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
Yeah, it did teleport me farther away

288
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,620
How rude

289
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:24,380
Wow so aggressive see how demure I am with my spells very cute see

290
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,060
Very respectful just a one-time hit I

291
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:36,940
Don't unnecessarily punch the shit out of you. That's my brother's job

292
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,140
The hitbox is good insane you gotta wait for the green light to walk

293
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,220
Wait, did she regain health what the fuck

294
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,060
I

295
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,340
Why do I have less health than her

296
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,900
Okay, sorry, thank you for the sub I forgot

297
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,820
Sometimes I just hear the noise and I'm like Pikmin sound

298
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:26,020
But then I realized wait, it's not just a Pikmin sound it's someone it's someone membership. It's a membership

299
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,020
Not a sub

300
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,300
Oh fuck I'm gonna die

301
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,620
You want to be punched okay square up

Okay

313
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,260
This is obviously not the portal what is even the point of this

314
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:04,980
How do how does one get down there your brat regardless I am

I

317
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,580
Feel like I feel like I'm going the wrong direction. I

318
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,020
Feel like there's a different direction. It's the portal near near the yellow arrow

319
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,740
Portal near that yeah, yeah, yeah, where's the yellow?

320
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,540
You wait past the portal

321
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,500
Okay, I'm gonna go back to where I was before

322
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
No

323
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,660
Walk across the bridge

324
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,260
You hold on I gotta deal with this thing first

325
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,860
The yellow arrow should work, but it I can't

326
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,700
Who the fuck is this motherfucker get out of my fight?

327
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,260
Who are you I invite you

328
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:25,620
Did it did the duel would you want to watch me play Yu-Gi-Oh? I don't actually know how to play Yu-Gi-Oh

329
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,380
Oops, sorry game post

330
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,540
There's two of them now

331
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,340
Whatever

332
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,740
Is Yu-Gi-Oh complicated

333
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,140
Is Yu-Gi-Oh hard we can always teach you do you know how to play it?

334
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:54,980
Modern Yu-Gi-Oh is pretty complex. Yeah, I heard maybe hi

335
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,340
Nice well fizzled. Oh shit, where do I get more mana from do you know?

336
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
Because I don't

337
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,980
Would you read the card effects no I would choose whichever card looks the coolest

338
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:25,700
Okay, let's let's kill this one and leave. Oh, then Yu-Gi-Oh is not for you

339
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:35,380
If you emulate an older Yu-Gi-Oh game, it could be fun. Mm-hmm. I don't think I care enough to emulate one though

340
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:40,700
I'm not great at emulating the only game. I've ever cared enough to emulate was diabolic lovers

341
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,180
That's my toxic trait

342
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,700
In pal what I want to play alone though

343
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,300
Do not join the game do not join. Thank you

344
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,980
Diabolic lovers interesting. That's my toxic trait. It's a terrible terrible terrible game

00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,740

00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:13,100
Let's go I didn't see any um

354
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,340
Any portal though. Oh

355
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:27,340
This is the portal. Oh, thank you. Okay. All right. I'm an idiot. I'm just an idiot. Okay. Thank you

356
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,100
Hi, strongy. Good job on the cover by the way. Thank you

357
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:38,300
Wait, where am I supposed to go from here? Oh up here. Thank you. It was hard

358
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:43,540
It was hard actually not that one wasn't too bad now

359
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,820
What I can see let's see what I can see

360
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:57,820
Just remember to follow the yellow arrow and you'll be good. Thank you if I'm right and I usually am

361
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:04,220
Whoever's enchanting these storm amulets also kidnapped Susie. They probably have Susie imprisoned close by I

362
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:14,080
Can use the link between the wand and Susie to find her and the link between the storm amulets and their maker to produce a vision

363
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,420
Here goes mouth. It's the guy whose mouth doesn't move. Yeah, he's the nerd

364
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:22,460
He's the nerds the nerds nerd nerds emoji

365
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:28,460
Nothing, whoever this is, they want to accept friend of course because she doesn't want to friends with us. That's all exactly

366
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,620
Exactly true. I'm sorry

367
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:40,220
I'm alone will at the middle across the river go talk to blad raven eye and get us a crystal

368
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,940
Get us a crystal

369
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,900
All right

370
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,420
Have you been training it sounded great. Oh no

371
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,060
Well, I sing alone in the shower and shit, but um

372
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,620
Like

373
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:04,300
I don't think my shower singing is is what I would call training. It sounds pretty bad

374
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,140
I don't even know I used to actually like put in effort with like, um

375
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,900
Like blowing through a straw like that breath breathing exercise

376
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,780
The undead stole all my crystals

377
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,380
And like doing um, like the up and down

378
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:31,580
Like vocal vocal warm-ups and stuff. I used to do that, but now I'm just like

379
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,380
I don't want to do it anymore. I'm tired and that's probably why I haven't really improved I say

380
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:45,260
My lightning rod won't work a scarlet screamer stole the primary coil

381
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:52,300
You could help get me up and running again gather up the folks and get my coil back from the scarlet screamers

382
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,460
And I'll get you a crystal

383
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:59,580
Um, I was talking about diabolical lovers diabolical lovers is a dating sim for the place

384
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,460
PlayStation I think

385
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,340
And it's just

386
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,420
It's just like I don't even know what to call it

387
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:17,100
It's um, wait, where am I supposed to oh I'm supposed to collect three cogs, right?

388
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,980
Collect cogs in Triton Avenue

389
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,340
It's like

390
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,220
Yeah, it's an ultimate game

391
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:31,900
Yeah, basically it's so bad. It's good like absolutely terrible for um

392
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,780
Women's rights 15 steps backwards

393
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:45,340
It's a really fucked up game and I um, I didn't have a playstation. Um, and

394
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,660
Most of the game is actually not even translated. It's a japanese game

395
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:56,060
So what I would do was there would be tumblr accounts. Yeah, it sets women back a hundred years probably more

396
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,620
but there would be tumblr accounts that

397
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,260
would um

398
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,300
Just translate the game to you line by line

399
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:12,460
And I would literally just read read the translations like I wouldn't even play the games because

400
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,020
I couldn't even find like a

401
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,140
like a

402
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,700
You know pirated emulator version for it. I only found it for like one of the games

403
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,020
I think it was for like the base main game, but there's like multiple games for it

404
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:30,460
And and I would just read the translations and that's that's how I would that's how I would like

405
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,060
I guess know the game

406
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:40,780
Because there isn't really um, I don't know did I collect that one already or oh, I already collected three. Okay

407
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,740
Um, such a problem's over. Yeah, there isn't really like

408
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:51,340
Recordings of the game. There's like nothing really because it's kind of a niche game. So

409
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,060
I would just goon to like shitty translations

410
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,580
And I'd be like fuck. Yeah, this is the best

411
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:07,500
But there's some really fucked up scenes in that let's just say that there's some really messed up scenes

412
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,460
honestly the whole anime and

413
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:14,300
They made two seasons of anime is is awful. It's brain rot

414
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:21,500
Absolutely awful defeat scarlet screamer. Oh, there she is scotted street screamer

415
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,300
I'm after you

416
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,180
Um

417
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:32,380
That's how you know, she's a real gooner. Yeah old tumbler was such a gold mine once. Oh wait, sorry

418
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,180
I'm gonna fight hold on. Okay. There we go

419
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,100
um

420
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,220
Once you

421
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:42,780
Weed through all the trash. There wasn't that much trash on old tumbler to me, but maybe because I was younger

422
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,380
I didn't realize

423
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:49,340
Like most adaptations of vn otamu's unfortunately. Yeah, there's not a lot of english versions

424
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,140
I would have paid I I still would pay good money

425
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,260
I

426
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:02,620
Fuck the thoughts I'm having right now. It's so down bad

427
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:08,620
Like um, you know how I don't really have like a central AC in my apartment

428
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:13,340
I was thinking like oh, maybe I should get like there's I actually found a real a really close apartment to me

429
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,460
like really close early like a

430
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,340
Five minute walk away from me that has central AC

431
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:24,300
But I was like fuck. I should really just pay my student loans first before I actually um

432
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,900
I'll have to defeat more than one

433
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,860
One out of three. Oh, okay. Um

434
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,060
Because you guys are actually

435
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,260
Really helping me pay my student loans. I don't even know how much I owe

436
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:42,060
We should log in together into my student loans account and see how much I owe. I actually don't know

437
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,540
But I was like fuck. I should really pay my student loans before I become irresponsible with money

438
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,020
shouldn't I

439
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,620
And just now I was like, you know what? I should just buy a playstation

440
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,580
Get my ass on ebay

441
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,860
And like find the japanese games

442
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:05,980
And find those little tumblr pages and use them to to play the games. Wait, I have like no mono left

443
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:14,060
New apartment funds. No, I can afford a new apartment. I'm just like I should probably pay my student loans first, you know

444
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,860
Um

445
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,140
That's probably like the smarter thing to do. Um, unfortunately

446
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:27,020
All my homies hate education loans me too America seems to hate dating seems in general even if they're good

447
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,420
The diabolic lovers doesn't sound like it's all that good

448
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:38,300
Diabolic lovers would get canceled in America. They wouldn't even let that be on the market. They'd be like this is um

449
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,980
This is immoral

450
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,740
What do I do?

451
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,740
I don't have mana

452
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:52,620
I tried making her spicy cheesy ricey posted on twitter for dinner. It was great. Thank you for the inspiration. Ah, I'm glad you like it

What do I do thank you for the 50, uh

456
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,180
The the 50 memberships holy crap

457
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:17,100
Um, honestly from what I heard the faster you pay for those loans the less they'll cost you the longer until they go

458
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,860
Up with time. Yeah

459
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,860

00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,740
There's bad stuff on steam too like sayano uta and no one bats an eye

465
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:54,220
I guess so you're right. You're right. Um

466
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
What do I

467
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,820
Um

468
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,740
The last time I heard of diabolic lovers was when the anime dropped and it seems like twilight but reverse harem

469
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,500
It's worse than twilight

470
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:14,940
It's like it's like 10 times worse than twilight. You can go to the school and get your free cards the school

Special

488
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,780

00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,820
um

508
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,820
There's so much shit around here. Hold on

509
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,740
I can go go to the girl's dorm

510
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:31,900
The boy I want to go to the girl's dorm. Where's the girl's dorm?

511
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:39,260
Is this the girl's dorm? No, it's the school of life. Why doesn't the balanced school have a whole fucking?

512
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,620
Oh

513
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,380
Oh

514
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,980
That's so cool. Should I just go to all of them?

515
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,860
Click your house button at the bottom

516
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,180
I

517
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,740
Have a whole house

518
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:14,860
Oh, yeah, I forgot you can have a house in here. I have a bank with money in it. Oh no, there's no money in it

519
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:24,780
Rip to your points. Oh shit wait, I didn't know I had a limited amount of points

520
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:30,620
If you're gonna play alone, I recommend getting some life spells to heal you

521
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,260
I

522
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,460
You can buy your points back, but

523
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:49,500
Or the spells that I got bad how do I get rid of this?

524
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,780
I

525
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,780
Panty raid this isn't the girl's dorm though, is it?

526
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,020
Oh, you bought life spells so you're fine. Oh

527
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:19,900
Oops, where am I? Where's my house on this map?

528
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,980
You

529
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:27,100
Unintentionally got a good school. It's just the healing school. Okay

530
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,700
I don't really seem to have many drawers in here for you to raid

531
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:41,580
The windows got like nothing in it. I live on those streets

532
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,420
Okay, um

533
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,380
So wait, where is my points?

534
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,780
Oh training points, oh

535
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,540
Oh

536
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,420
Can I get more like

537
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,700
This like mana or something

538
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:17,740
You are in the girl's dorm the tower on the right slot of the entrance slash exit of Ravenwood

539
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,740
Oh this tower

540
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,100
Oh

541
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:47,660
Oh, it's my house. Oh, there's no other girls though

542
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,980
The blue orbs floating around refill mana. Oh

543
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:55,980
Okay, I'm guessing I can't take that

544
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,940
What is this goofy? What do you mean goofy?

545
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:09,660
Okay, well, uh, let's go back to where we were before then can I teleport there?

546
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:13,100
I'm acting as if I know where I'm supposed to go

547
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:24,700
I'm so tempted to buy a playstation though. Oh my god, there's so much shit on screen

548
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:28,140
Just so I could play diabolic lovers again

549
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,860
There are some spicy scenes

550
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,620
There are some also just very immoral scenes

551
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,060
Most of the game was full of immoral scenes

552
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,540
But that's what I liked about it

553
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:47,900
That's what I liked about it. I spent like my entire summer of like

554
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,260
I want to say eighth grade summer

555
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,020
Is that from a while ago?

556
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,860
I think so

557
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,860
Because it's a super chat. Okay

558
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,060
Back to game sounds

559
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,140
You can leave a mark on the bottom right

560
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:13,340
Which will cost you mana, but you can teleport back to it from anytime bottom, right?

561
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,820
Oh mark location. Oh, okay. Thank you

562
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,860
Okay, okay, okay

563
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:29,580
Um, the immorality is what makes it spicy. Yes, exactly. You get it. Thank you. I'm glad you get it. I'm glad you get it

564
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,620
I mean, I guess I'm not what's in here

565
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,100
I don't know

566
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,100
I guess I'm not supposed to

567
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,100
I'm gonna close chat

568
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,860
Oh no, is that gonna say

569
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,980
I guess if anyone's gonna get it, it would be you

570
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:51,900
Thanks, we know a lot of these later. We're kind of spamming you with info. It's okay. It's okay. I don't mind

571
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:55,180
I

572
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,660
Dungeon you haven't unlocked yet. Oh

573
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:05,020
Okay, very cool. I like dungeons taboos are learning

574
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,940
Oops, sorry every time I click out of the game it makes it pause

575
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:19,500
Isn't spicy the point of those games? Honestly

576
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,460
Female like

577
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,420
Uh, I guess uh dating sims

578
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:33,100
Aimed for like a female audience are nowhere near

579
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,140
as like insane

580
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,620
messed up

581
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,620
fucked up as like

582
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:44,060
Dating sims aim towards a male wait

583
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,460
Wait

584
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,500
Am I going the right way?

585
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:56,140
Uh dating sims aim towards a male audience like especially like the popular ones

586
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:01,980
They're nowhere near as fucked up. Unfortunately. There's like a couple

587
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,420
That I can think of that are like

588
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:10,860
Oh, you play through the whole game and then like the ending is kind of messed up kind of

589
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,820
but

590
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,460
It's like you have to play through the whole game to even get there, you know

591
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:25,500
Our male dating sims fucked up. I think there's a lot more popular fucked up ones if you ask me

592
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:33,900
Omega verse stuff blows my mind. Oh my god. I literally got an omega verse tick tock ad

593
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:39,740
Wait, I was trying to advertise. I think it was trying to advertise someone's book or someone's app. It was so funny

594
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,740
It was like pov

595
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:45,500
You're no mega and you're in heat and your alphas

596
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,420
plural

597
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:51,020
Are away and so you have to satisfy yourself

598
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:56,700
So you fucking it was so random. Um, it was like so you sit on a knotted

599
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:58,140
um

600
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,140
build-o

601
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:06,700
I don't remember what happened. It was like you fell asleep on the knotted build-o and your alphas find you

602
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,180
And they're like we'll take it if you baby care

603
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,820
It was really cringey and so funny

604
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:21,660
Female oriented dating sims are wack but male dating sims are way more horny. Yeah

605
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:26,620
No, the female oriented ones are not that wack if you ask me. I mean, I'm sure they're cringe

606
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:30,220
But I feel like they're not that wack and they're definitely not as horny either. Yeah

607
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:38,060
Like if you want the fucked up ones you have to go for like indie ones

608
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:40,940
And even then they're not not that fucked up

609
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:45,020
What is her feet? My feet is surprisingly normal

610
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,820
My feet is normal actually

611
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,180
Like genuinely

612
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:56,620
How the fuck didn't I like that be allowed on a tiktok of all platformers

613
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:00,380
I go though, but it was funny as hell. Let them slip the giggle sticks

614
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:07,100
How do you fall asleep like that? I I I don't know

615
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,180
I

616
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,380
I I don't know ask she be she has a knotted build-o

617
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:21,260
I don't think we can match your freak on this one. I'm not I'm actually not really that into omega verse stuff

618
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:24,540
I think it's overused. It's cringe and overused

619
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,660
full of reckons

620
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:31,340
No, my tiktok for you pages not full of reckons

621
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:37,740
It is not that's just twitter and I don't know why I genuinely don't know why

622
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:47,580
Because my usual for you page is like my little pony like on twitter. It's like my little pony and um

623
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,860
Uh

624
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,860
Rats

625
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,860
Those two

626
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,100
But for some reason on imi

627
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:01,660
It was

628
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:07,260
Wait, there's nothing to it. Okay, bother this soggy place and be bother you if this coil

629
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:12,140
So precious to you take it. Thank you. I will take it

630
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,740
Thank you

631
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,900
Raccoons are the ponies of rats what

632
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:25,420
I don't have anything against raccoons. I'm just a little confused as to why my twitter like

633
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:33,020
Home page was just full of raccoon stuff on the on the one time that I scroll through it. Can I go in here? No

634
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,140
The one time I scroll through it

635
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:42,140
Stranny got another one. Oh, maybe I should get one too just to join in

636
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,500
Um

637
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:59,820
Be bother what does be bother even mean now put those cogs to good use and get the old wheel turn in

638
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,980
I'll fix the lightning rod

639
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:04,380
Okay

640
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:08,380
Which wheels these ones

641
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:17,900
Oh, there's fish in here. Oh my god, and they run away from you

642
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:25,660
Oh my god, they're so cute. All right. We're ready here. Just pull this lever and we'll charge that lumina crystal right up

643
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,900
Click the pet icon next to your mono

644
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:34,380
Yes, should I make my pet happier?

645
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:42,460
Well done wizard. Well done wizard

646
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:52,060
There's so many bronies that it must feel weird to be a female my little pony fan, huh? No

647
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:57,180
No, not at all. I I don't interact with the um

648
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:02,540
Thanks to you. I'm back in business. I don't interact with the pony fandom really

649
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:11,980
Other than like on twitter one brand new fully charged lumina crystal. She's a beauty. I hope she serves you well

650
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:15,980
Lumina crystal

651
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,980
Did he start laughing at me?

652
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:20,300
You laughing

653
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,500
Um, like I don't go to like pony conventions or anything

654
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:28,220
But you're right if I did there probably would be a lot of dudes there wouldn't there

655
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:43,020
Yeah, I just watch this I just watch the fandom from a chair

656
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,420
That's what I do. Yep

657
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:52,540
I don't I really don't interact with any of the fandoms I'm in

658
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:57,420
A lumina crystal this should be just what we need

659
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:04,140
The lumina crystal will boost the power of my ritual. It'll work this time. I'm sure of it

660
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:11,420
It's not work before. Oh, okay. It's working Susie. I can see her. But what was that horrifying thing with her?

661
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:16,140
That's the harvest lord. We studied him in class. He's a power

662
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,900
Underworld who harvest the souls of the innocent

663
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:24,620
Um, do those even still exist after gen four? I don't know

664
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,460
They kind of fucking look like she's in the fandom

665
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:36,700
I'll not kill them, but they slap the fandom across the face with the new system with the newest ponies. Honestly, they're so

666
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,620
They're so bad

667
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:43,740
I could go on a little rant about them

668
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:47,260
Because I watched I didn't watch the show

669
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:50,700
I'll go on a little rant about gen is a gen five

670
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,060
Is it gen five? I think it's gen five

671
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:57,100
um

672
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,100
I didn't watch like

673
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:03,180
gen three two or one. I um

674
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:07,740
Like I have my little pony toys, but I didn't watch the show

675
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:11,900
Mostly because I didn't know there was a show when I was a kid

676
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:16,300
I don't think I could even have the facilities to watch the show if even if I knew but

677
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:22,300
Um, I did watch like the the friendship is magic one

678
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:29,100
And I really enjoyed it. I really liked it. It was nice. I did watch a few of like

679
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:34,140
I think it was gen three. I watched the movies like the old movies

680
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:39,900
Um, one thing I didn't like about gen four is that they changed spikes spikes voice

681
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:44,780
When I first saw the new spike, I was like, who the fuck is this guy? This isn't a spike

682
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,180
This sounds nothing like spike

683
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:54,060
But then I got used to to spikes new voice and it doesn't bother me as much but they changed his voice

684
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:59,660
The old stuff is stereotypically girly it is but I would say the new stuff is too

685
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:06,060
If you wait if you've only watched in four wise material favorite because I watched the movies like the old movies

686
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:07,660
As well

687
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:11,340
That's why like I didn't watch the show, but I watched some of the movies

688
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:13,580
So

689
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,460
This is how we attract drama by talking about my little pony

690
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:25,980
Is that how gen five that bad I didn't watch okay, I'll I'll I'll tell you basically

691
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,500
Basically, um

692
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:35,820
Oh

693
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:44,940
Everything that they built up plot wise in gen four was like

694
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:50,300
Shad on by the new show and by the movie

695
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:55,420
Like the movie literally starts off by like telling the story

696
01:06:56,060 --> 01:07:01,420
Of like the main six and being like look at all the cool things they did and they brought friendship to

697
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,980
To equestria and

698
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:10,460
And then they were like anyways, that doesn't apply anymore

699
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:16,060
Everything that happened. Yeah, we're gonna forget about that and um

700
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:22,940
We're just gonna poke a bunch of plot holes into the story and tell a new story that

701
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:30,460
Has absolutely no link and um contradicts the old story like no link to the old story and contradicts the old story

702
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,420
basically like um

703
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:37,420
Like the start of the movie for gen five

704
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:41,100
Is basically saying like back in the day

705
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:45,100
All of the all the pony types were friends

706
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,820
But now they're not anymore

707
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:50,220
and it's like

708
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:52,140
what happened

709
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:53,900
and also

710
01:07:53,900 --> 01:08:00,940
In friendship is magic, you know, that was a thing where like the ponies weren't friends anymore like the the earthpony the um

711
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:03,580
the earthpony is the

712
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:08,460
What's it called pegasus is is and the um

713
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:17,020
The unicorns the pegasi and the unicorns

714
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:22,780
Um, that was a thing like they told the story of of how, you know, they weren't all friends at the start

715
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:26,300
And when that was happening they had wendigos

716
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:28,860
They had like the wendigos

717
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:30,940
going around and um

718
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,420
like

719
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,420
um

720
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:41,180
Massacring, I don't know causing trouble like it was all like a cold land and

721
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,300
Wait, what is this?

722
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,300
I don't know

723
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:50,620
Gen five gave magic to those who didn't have homes. What's with that?

724
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:57,660
Oh horns that too. So that too. That's another thing. So um, there was no wendigoons. Wendigoons. Wendigos

725
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,740
There was no wendigos

726
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:05,740
I knew my little prisoner would draw more to me like flies to honey

727
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:11,500
There were no wendigos in gen five. They were just like, yeah, none of the ponies are friends anymore

728
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:16,060
But forget about the wendigos. That's another thing that doesn't happen anymore. I guess um

729
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:20,940
And then not only that but um

730
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:25,260
Just instead of wendigos all the

731
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:30,780
All of the ponies lost magic and for some reason the pegasi just can't fly anymore

732
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,900
Because apparently you need magic to fly

733
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:37,340
That's something I didn't understand

734
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:40,140
Like oh well the ponies magic doesn't exist anymore

735
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:42,620
You know, they didn't know it's because the ponies weren't friends anymore

736
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:45,420
But they were just like magic existed long ago but not anymore

737
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:50,780
And also the pegasi can't fly and it's like but they have wings you don't need magic to fly

738
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:56,380
But then when they get their magic back they can fly but that doesn't make sense because you don't need magic to fly

739
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,900
Their wings aren't big enough for their bodies to fly so they have

740
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:07,740
So without magic, but it's stupid though. That was never like you don't need magic to fly. That's stupid to me

741
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:14,700
um and yeah, uh before in friendship is magic like

742
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:17,660
Only the pegasi had

743
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:20,620
Magical powers

744
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:24,700
Um, sorry not the pegasi the unicorns like only the unicorns had magical powers

745
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:28,540
The ponies with corn with horns had magical powers and that's it

746
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:31,420
Okay, if a pony had a horn, she had magical powers

747
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:35,260
But if she didn't have a horn, there was no magical powers at all, but for some reason

748
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:41,900
And also the ponies with horns and wings were like princesses, you know

749
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:44,460
Alicorns were princesses

750
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:49,980
But for some fuck ass reason they just made the main character like at the end of the movie

751
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,420
They gave her magic and they like made her an alicorn

752
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:56,540
And I was like, but why though? She's not a princess

753
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,980
Like why would you do that?

754
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:03,180
Then not needing magic was never part of the established lore. I think

755
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:05,420
Yeah

756
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:07,420
Wait

757
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:10,220
What

758
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:13,820
Their wings

759
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:20,700
Birds have magic confirmed. That's how birds fly. They're magical

760
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:28,300
I didn't know my little pony had so much story and lore to it. There's so much

761
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:37,020
I'm gen 4 everything in nature kind of needed ponies to interfere like leaves don't fall seasons don't change and weather doesn't happen really

762
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:42,060
Oh wait, no. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, you're right. Sorry. I forgot. Yeah

763
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:44,860
Yeah, they need the ponies to do it

764
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:48,620
Like bring the winter clouds over and stuff. I thought that was cool though

765
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:55,820
Yeah, sorry the pegasi kind of had weather based magic, but like not really that much

766
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,100
um

767
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:02,700
But another thing that fucked me up was fucking

768
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:08,300
In the new show first of all, I I I wanted to try watching the new show

769
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:14,060
Um Eliza Koshy voices one of the characters and I fucking hate Eliza Koshy. She's so fucking annoying

770
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:18,220
So that was one one of the reasons why I didn't want to watch it because I was like

771
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:23,340
I don't want to listen to Eliza Koshy all the time. She's zip and it's like shut the fuck up

772
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:31,020
The sound of her voice annoys me. She's just a youtuber if you see her stuff. She's like really annoying. I

773
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:36,700
She just annoys me. Okay her existence annoys me. So I was like getting annoyed by that

774
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:40,540
Um

775
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:53,580
Oh my god, the voice acting in this is so good. I know what he's talking about. Meet me outside wizard. I need your help

776
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:56,220
Okay

777
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:57,660
Um

778
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,260
Another reason is

779
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:01,260
Dude, so the graphics

780
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:03,820
Graphics, I guess the animation quality for

781
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,620
The movie was all right

782
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:11,900
It was it was not bad, but the animation quality for the show for gen five

783
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:15,900
Is so bad. It's genuinely

784
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:19,100
It's genuinely so ugly

785
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:24,220
Like and like channel storm energy. I don't even know how to explain like the harvest

786
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:28,700
I know it's goofy to enchant the ambulance girl. Your lipstick is awful

787
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:35,740
It's the old one was so popular. Why do they change generations? I don't know about my little pony. I don't know

788
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,100
They wanted to tell a new story. I guess what they fucked up

789
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:43,740
Do they have a poppers budget? Yeah powerpoint quality

790
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:49,180
It was bad. It was bad. It was really bad quality

791
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:56,220
And that's another reason why I couldn't watch it, but apparently they reintroduced spike

792
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:59,420
Which I thought was cool because there's no

793
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:04,140
Characters that actually show up from the old shows

794
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,100
Like literally none of them ever

795
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:09,340
From what I know

796
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:12,940
I think there's no characters, but they reintroduced spike for some reason

797
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:16,540
And at the end of friendship is magic

798
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:20,460
They show spike as an adult like spike was a child throughout the whole show

799
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:25,660
But they they show spike as an adult at the end and he's a Chad. Okay. He looks like a Chad

800
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:31,660
Not even the princess is not that I know of no, not even the princess is he was he wasn't mega Chad. Okay

801
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:38,220
He looked a little goofy and I thought it was funny because I'm not used to seeing spike like that because

802
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:44,140
spike was like a child throughout literally all like ever since spike was introduced

803
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:48,540
He was like a cute tiny little dragon. So it was super weird to see him chatified, but whatever

804
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:51,180
um

805
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,260
but

806
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,740
When they show him again in gen five, he's like

807
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:59,580
Suddenly an entirely different shape and body type

808
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:03,900
Like now he's like before at the end of gen four. He was like

809
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,620
standing on two legs

810
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:10,860
And then now he's like standing on four legs and he's like a long dragon

811
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:16,300
It was weird. He they DJ. Yeah, they de-chatified my boy spike

812
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:19,900
He's no longer Chad. What the fuck man?

813
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:30,620
They took his aura. Did he stop simping for rarity? Um, I don't think he ever stopped simping for rarity

814
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:33,500
But she's probably dead in the new show. So yeah

815
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:39,980
Look how they massacred my boy. That's genuinely how I feel about spike

816
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:43,020
and not only that

817
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:46,700
Um in gen four like every single what is this?

818
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:54,140
Oh, okay, can I do something with it?

819
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,020
Uh

820
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:12,780
I guess not the agent. Oh, okay recipe. I have no recipes

821
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:17,180
Um

822
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:22,380
In in gen four all of the dragons look different

823
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:27,820
Like they all have different body shapes and they're all different sizes

824
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:35,900
I think I have to use the teleporter

825
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:39,420
Like they all oh, there's another one over here

826
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:42,700
They all look very very different from each other

827
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:46,300
But then in gen five like all of the dragons just have the same body type

828
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,100
literally all of them and it's like

829
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,660
what

830
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:56,060
You you massacred the entire species at that point. Uh, did I fuck up?

831
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:02,380
Gen five spike looks like a background dragon inspired where sucks because the dragon design in gen four were so good. Yeah

832
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:06,700
It does look like a background character. It was the other one. Oh

833
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:14,940
Same body type sounds lazy as fuck. I know it's like they didn't want to um

834
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:17,180
Um

835
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:22,940
It's like they didn't want to make new 3d models for the new characters, you know

836
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,100
It's probably not like

837
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:30,460
Well

838
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:33,260
Oh, sorry, I didn't want to take a break. It's probably

839
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:39,180
That the nexus could explode at any moment the controls

840
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:43,500
They aren't working. I can't set it right. It's cheaper. It is cheaper

841
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:47,980
And you can tell that they're trying to make it cheaper because the show looks so cheap

842
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:52,300
It's so cheap

843
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:57,100
I'm really sad about that. I'm really sad about that

844
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:02,780
You can get to ravenwood and back quickly by pressing the mark button to set your location. Give it a try

845
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:07,900
Use the return to commons button to get back to the commons and then head to ravenwood

846
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:25,260
That sounds like a huge change between season four and five. Did they change directors or something? I don't know probably

847
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:32,060
Probably you know what I'm I want to I'm looking up this fuck-ass director

848
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:35,020
And you know what I'm setting a curses way later on today

849
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:41,420
My little funny

850
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:48,860
So the director for friendship is magic

851
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:58,780
Jason thyssen jason theason and jim miller. Okay, those were the two directors

852
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,980
But for gen five

853
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:06,940
It's

854
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:10,780
Fucking robert cullen and hosé louis ucha

855
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:13,180
both of you

856
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:14,940
both of you fucked up

857
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:21,180
And mark fadabin and cecile kramer and peter louis all of you bitches fucked up and you're gonna regret it

858
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:28,860
I'm gonna make you regret it. I'm gonna make you I'm gonna make you regret massacring my favorite shill

859
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:37,820
Some coolest block was broke was probably like this is only a kid's show kids would never notice if we if we reduced the quality a bit

860
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:40,700
I notice I saw it all

861
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:44,300
I noticed it all

862
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:51,340
Part of it might be because gen 14 didn't want to make more but hasbro wants to make more. That's very possible

863
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:54,060
That's very possible

864
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:58,700
And you know what I'm I'm betting I'm gonna bet all

865
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:02,780
Out of money that those new producers

866
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:07,260
And directors didn't even watch the original fucking show

867
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:11,420
Or they watched like season one

868
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:15,820
Or they watched like season one and they were like, okay

869
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:21,180
I think we get it and then they fucked off and made you know the rest of the show

870
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,500
Don't have that

871
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:33,260
Here take this master key ring it against the metal of the nexus three times and the feedback loop should end good luck and move quickly

872
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:38,300
If you marked your location click the recall button to return to your mark

873
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:43,340
Tell them sis. I'm a vtuber and you'll regret this

874
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:49,740
I looked up lysokoshi. I see what you mean. I was only able to stand her for five seconds. She's really annoying

875
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:53,980
I don't know much about mlp, but if this wants them to pay they will pay

876
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:59,580
I was enough they could have grown up watching it

877
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:07,900
The directors no nothing not not gen four. I don't think they grew up watching it

878
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:15,660
Um, let me set up the thing. Can I know whose birthday it is?

879
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:17,660
Whose birthday is it?

880
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:22,220
Okay, I marked the location

881
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:36,540
The new team was like my little what never heard of it

882
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:42,540
You want me to write a show about ponies? Okay, sure. Yeah, I bet

883
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:48,300
I can do that

884
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:52,700
Oh, it's the anniversary. Oh 16th birthday. Oh

885
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:57,660
That's so exciting. Happy birthday wizard 101

886
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,820
Can I get these?

887
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:04,060
Give them to me

888
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:10,140
Um, nothing turns me off more than youtubers with no history of voice acting is voice acting in a show

889
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:13,180
It almost never leads to a good performance. You know what?

890
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:21,180
For this one, I don't think her voice acting is oh, we already have full mana. I don't think her voice acting is particularly bad

891
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:26,460
But I just can't stand her

892
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:28,460
like

893
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:32,460
When I first heard her I was like something's wrong. Something's wrong

894
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:39,420
My brain could tell something was wrong and I didn't like it and then I realized it's because it's fucking Liza Koshy voicing her

895
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,180
And then I was like, okay

896
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:43,180
What the fuck is going on here?

897
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:49,420
Okay

898
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:58,220
Congratulations wizard 101 year old enough to get real in England. Oh my

899
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:09,660
YouTubers acting in games is horrible too. I just I I'm gonna be real. I I don't yeah, she gave me the ick. I just I don't want

900
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:13,980
I don't want youtubers in my stuff

901
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:16,780
unless it unless they've had like

902
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:21,740
I don't know how to explain it

903
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:28,140
I guess I just want them to have more experience before they go into big shows like my little pony

904
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:30,860
Like start off small, you know

905
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:35,580
And maybe she did but also it's Liza Koshy. So I don't really care because her she annoys me

906
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:39,580
She annoys me in general. So I don't really care

907
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:45,340
Big bro carrying around in me. Yep. Like there's um

908
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:52,300
There's a youtuber that voices in dungeon meshi and I think he does a good job. I forgot his name though

909
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:54,940
I'll be real if I forgot or his name

910
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:01,420
But I feel like a lot of youtubers kind of just get in because of their names

911
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:09,500
Because they got that big name attached to them prosy deep prosy deep. Yeah. I watched his uh vines too. He was funny

912
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:12,380
MLP is starting small

913
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:16,860
MLP is not starting small excuse if I have the opportunity

914
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:19,420
to voice act

915
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:24,460
And my little pony I would be over the moon. I would be like holy shit

916
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:31,420
This is it for me. This is my big break. MLP is not starting small at all. Where am I going?

917
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:33,660
I

918
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:45,180
Me should voice everyone in MLP, you know what I'm gonna do my own horn. I feel like

919
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:50,860
I feel like I did a really good job singing um

920
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:53,580
Gypsy bard in our karaoke stream

921
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:56,300
Where the fuck am I supposed to go?

922
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:59,420
Oh here. I feel like I did a really good

923
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:01,820
Oh here

924
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,980
I feel like I did a really good job singing that song

925
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:14,380
I feel like my voice fit in that song really well and I think I could I think I could voice acted my little pony

926
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:21,420
But I obviously have not enough experience experience and my microphone is like nowhere near like studio

927
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:23,900
quality

928
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:28,860
Your voice works well for ponies. Yeah, I think it does

929
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:34,220
I think it does. I think I could totally be like some random background pony

930
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:39,820
Yeah, my microphone is nowhere near as good and also they're not recording the show anymore

931
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:43,180
So it doesn't matter. I was way too young when they were actually recording the show

932
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:49,740
Official cover when you're tempting me, but I

933
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,060
like

934
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:54,220
As fun as song covers are to me

935
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:56,140
um

936
01:25:56,140 --> 01:26:01,900
They just don't they don't they don't do well, you know, so I'm not like tempted to make song covers

937
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:05,420
Uh, unfortunately

938
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:10,300
As fun as they are to do like

939
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:16,860
I think I'm better. I'm better off using the time to make like can you please direct me in the same fucking direction?

940
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:20,860
Why do you keep? I don't know. Maybe it's this way

941
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:27,420
Um, I forgot I was gonna say

942
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:31,820
Whoa, look at that guy

943
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:36,940
Oh, yeah, my time is better off spent like recording shorts

944
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:41,180
uh recording video like asmr videos, um

945
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:47,340
Recording honestly patreon audios. I still haven't done that for next month

946
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:49,580
So

947
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:52,780
It would be a love letter for us of my little pony song cover

948
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:57,020
Hearing you yelling and cussing mommy long legs from puffy playtime chapter two and honestly

949
01:26:57,020 --> 01:27:00,300
I can imagine that in some chaotic scene in my little pony

950
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:07,900
Screw the numbers we love your passion projects, but

951
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:12,620
I care about the numbers

952
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:15,660
I'm a number idiot

953
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:18,620
I care about the numbers

954
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:23,100
I care about the numbers. I'm sorry

955
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:28,620
I care

956
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:31,980
Kira buckland technically started out small and online as well

957
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:36,140
And now she's a pretty big voice actor. I don't know. Maybe you'll see me in something

958
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:41,020
Down the line. Maybe who knows who knows probably not

959
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:43,980
I don't know

960
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:46,860
You rescued susie

961
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:54,460
Should I voice act the harvest lord has been driven back into the shadows should I voice actor wizard 101? That'd be so fun

962
01:27:55,980 --> 01:28:00,220
I'm gonna send an email to wizard 101 with my demo reel. I don't even have a demo reel

963
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:08,460
I don't even have a demo reel, but um, that'd be so cool. So the harvest lord said he had a dark mass

964
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:10,540
Count you care about memories? I do

965
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:15,660
Even aside from projects we're here for you

966
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:19,980
I'm a pinpell because I find you children pleasant even in azatsu. Oh, thank you

967
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:24,540
Well, this is the numbers Andy. I am

968
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:33,180
Um, yeah, it's part of the job. I feel like if I didn't care enough about numbers like why am I even here?

969
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:37,740
Just at least a little bit you got to care, you know

970
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:41,740
At least a little bit. Otherwise, I should just you know

971
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:46,140
go back to like streaming once a week as an indy

972
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:49,260
and uh dicking around

973
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:56,380
Are they even creating new wizards 101 story for people to voice acting? I don't know

974
01:28:57,820 --> 01:29:02,460
I don't know but from the sound of it. They don't have the highest um

975
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:10,620
They don't have the highest standards for their voice acting which makes me feel like I could get in

976
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:18,220
It makes me feel like I I could I could get in I could totally let me just send a quick email. Let me just uh

977
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:23,180
I have no strings to pull. Let me just beg on my knees and cry and plead

978
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:26,700
Isn't wizard 101 still updating?

979
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:30,060
They should be no, I don't know

980
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:37,340
Don't a thumb goal should have should have a MLP song covering could you know what sure sure

981
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:41,820
For for don't a thong sure. I'm fine with that

982
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:44,940
Are these side quests?

983
01:29:45,820 --> 01:29:47,820
Just because that's a little different

984
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:52,460
Okay

985
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:55,340
Did you collect my fucking sticks before I could?

986
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:59,260
That's a little different because that's what you guys want. Um

987
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:01,420
Oh

988
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:04,140
What greetings young wizard?

989
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:08,300
So you're interested in learning about crafting

990
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:10,940
Wonderful

991
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:13,500
Let's get started with your first lesson

992
01:30:14,620 --> 01:30:19,420
The first rule is to have a clean well lit place to work

993
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:25,660
Maybe maybe maybe we need to make a new demo table. I could yeah, I'd probably have to

994
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:28,780
She sounds just like

995
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,060
Other supplies

996
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:34,060
We'll need some mistwood

997
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:40,460
You can find mistwood growing all over wizard city. I think I have mistwood, right?

998
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:49,420
Bring the mistwood back I have and we'll soon have you a nice new place to work

999
01:30:50,780 --> 01:30:52,780
I have mistwood though

1000
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:56,780
Do you have the mistwood for me yet?

1001
01:30:56,780 --> 01:31:02,460
We're not we'll need it to build your basic crafting table hurry now

1002
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:06,940
I thought I had it I was behind her

1003
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:14,300
That mistwood should do nicely

1004
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:17,340
Why she got purple lipstick? I don't know this game

1005
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:22,940
She gets to work with hammer plane and saw in a few moments you have a nice little work table

1006
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:28,220
Oh my I never heard her voice before they have a weird obsession with um

1007
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:35,740
Weird cut weird colored lipstick in this game now with a basic crafting table you have a place to work

1008
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:41,740
Thank you

1009
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:48,060
Now with your work table you can begin to learn the fine trade of crafting

1010
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:50,380
Her face reminds me of a titan from attack on titan

1011
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:54,700
Did her voice change first?

1012
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:56,700
It's just another narrator I guess

1013
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,700
Crafting table in your dorm room or castle

1014
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:04,620
Your first assignment is to make two daggers of absolution

1015
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:07,340
You should have no difficulty

1016
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:13,020
You'll need to buy a recipe from me and then gather the required ingredients

1017
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:18,940
When you've got all your ingredients use your basic crafting table to make the athames

1018
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:23,340
When you have made two daggers of absolution

1019
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:28,220
Bring them back to me and I'll award you a novice crafter badge

1020
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:30,860
A novice crafter badge

1021
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:37,020
Good luck. I can't wait to see them. It's the goth lipstick which fists the sorcery theme

1022
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:42,140
I guess I don't I don't particularly like the crazy lipsticks in this game though

1023
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:44,940
I kind of have to ps

1024
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:47,020
Have to go home

1025
01:32:56,060 --> 01:33:02,700
Did she just try to add a out of that was an old lady that was an old lady that is not out of out of

1026
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:04,780
Yeah

1027
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:08,780
Um, can I place the crafting table down?

1028
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:25,980
The point of the stream we've all been waiting for crafting

1029
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:41,500
A bit where is my crafting table?

1030
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:48,380
Are those different clothes? Oh, no, that's just me

1031
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:52,620
Oh the pissing break. Oh

1032
01:33:55,980 --> 01:34:00,140
This is not modern runescape does this game look modern to you

1033
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:03,260
I'm never planning to runescape though

1034
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:08,140
Wait, I can change my clothes. Where did I get these?

1035
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:12,220
Oh god, they're so ugly

1036
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:16,940
I didn't know I could change my clothes. Well, which one is better?

1037
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:23,580
Oh god, they're all ugly

1038
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:40,780
Thank you for the seven dollars. We you know, we love our pissing screen

1039
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:49,340
I didn't know you liked it that much

1040
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:53,980
You don't have you don't even have to leave your chair. I don't have a piss bottle

1041
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:59,820
Okay, wait, genuinely, where's my crafting table? Didn't she say to place it down?

1042
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:02,220
Oh

1043
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:07,340
Oh

1044
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:13,340
Wait, why is the crafting station like a guy? Oh never mind. I guess it's not a guy

1045
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:20,620
Wait, wait, are you telling me that this doesn't flip?

1046
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:28,780
It doesn't flip

1047
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:34,060
Can women have piss bottles? My pee goes like everywhere

1048
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:38,380
Like it doesn't go on a straight line. It like it goes everywhere. Like it

01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:42,460
It like trickles everywhere. They're tingles everywhere. It tingles

01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:46,860
Yeah, I need like a bucket

1051

01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:19,020

1170
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:37,820
Literally walking so okay, I'm gonna get rid of all the

01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:48,540
Compass stuff or no, I need the compass stuff actually

1172
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:52,460

01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:55,340
That's such a pretty mount. I want that mount

1174
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:03,340

When do you get mounts? I don't know

01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:27,020

Like

1250
01:58:40,060 --> 01:58:42,220
It's really it really depends on the neighborhood

1251
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:47,100
One care more kids every time bro. It really really depends on the neighborhood

1252

1255
01:59:03,620 --> 01:59:21,980
man that bitch um yeah it really depends on the neighborhood like some

1256
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:25,460
neighborhoods have a lot of kids and I feel like it's mostly like richer

1257
01:59:25,460 --> 01:59:30,020
neighborhoods where there's a lot of kids

1258
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:43,900
uh trick-or-treat you know I feel like it's richer neighborhoods usually where a

1259
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:52,020
lot of kids trick-or-treat but my neighborhood is like shitty like my

1260
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:56,820
neighborhood is right in front of a really busy road so there's like no one

1261
01:59:57,180 --> 02:00:09,380
no one trick-or-treating here but I would just fucking I would just love to

1262
02:00:09,380 --> 02:00:16,780
dress up in like a cute little Halloween outfit and like give candy to kids and

1263
02:00:16,780 --> 02:00:23,100
scare kids I would love to scare the kids it would be so fun but I don't think

1264
02:00:23,100 --> 02:00:29,980
I'll ever own a house so I'll probably never never give out candy to kids even

1265
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:33,540
my mom's neighborhood doesn't trick-or-treat you know rich people don't

1266
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:38,340
even give out candy most of the time they thought they did yeah you got to go

1267
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:43,980
to the suburbs like deeper into the suburbs which I never lived in the

1268
02:00:43,980 --> 02:00:51,940
suburbs really go sit in the park with a bag of candy

1269
02:00:51,940 --> 02:01:00,900
that's so fucking sauce it mean not only dishes out candy but also PTSD yeah I

1270
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:06,540
don't think I'll ever own a house maybe like a condo or what's it called like

1271
02:01:06,540 --> 02:01:11,060
those like small houses that are like connected like multiple of them are

1272
02:01:11,060 --> 02:01:19,580
connected together like maybe one of those but even then I'm not sure you

02:20:07,220 --> 02:20:11,860

1402
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:12,600
like

1403
02:20:14,420 --> 02:20:18,580

1411
02:21:04,340 --> 02:21:10,900
I have so many like villagers die because if you leave for a long time um

1412
02:21:12,740 --> 02:21:17,140
if you leave for a really long time then your villagers will get like a fucking plague

1413
02:21:18,020 --> 02:21:22,820
just die and you'll come back to like two villagers and they're both like elderly

1414
02:21:25,060 --> 02:21:30,020
they're both like elders and they're all alone and then you come back and like your entire

1415
02:21:30,020 --> 02:21:36,020
cemetery is like full your entire cemetery is full of all your um

02:21:53,060 --> 02:21:58,980
play webcams classic I hate games that try to make you feel bad for not playing

1419
02:21:58,980 --> 02:22:03,620
it's because they want you to like play consistently right that's why

1420
02:22:06,580 --> 02:22:08,980
how do I play webcams classic

1421
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:18,500

you'll see you'll see you'll see

1427
02:22:45,220 --> 02:22:50,420
games that make you dependent like a drug it's not a drug official villagers isn't a drug it's

1428
02:22:50,660 --> 02:22:59,220
it's just I don't know it was funny it was a funny game to me it was like the Sims I guess

I'm literally trying every combination from what I know because this is like

02:25:27,540 --> 02:25:34,660
I want to say I was like less than in first grade this was like before first grade

1448
02:25:34,660 --> 02:25:36,340
that I still have the same account

1449
02:25:39,540 --> 02:25:41,700

1450
02:25:44,180 --> 02:25:46,180

I'm glad I could I'm glad I could help

1452
02:25:54,740 --> 02:25:57,780

1453
02:26:08,180 --> 02:26:13,860
as if I remember the fucking email call her on stream no because she's gonna answer with my real

1454
02:26:13,860 --> 02:26:31,540
name she's gonna be like hi Amy real name what's wrong no I can't do that

1455
02:26:32,100 --> 02:26:35,220
huh

1456
02:26:43,620 --> 02:26:44,100
mute

1457
02:26:50,020 --> 02:26:51,700
she's not she's gonna call me Timmy

1458
02:26:55,460 --> 02:27:00,580
the problem is I don't know if she knows either I remembered for a long time but I guess

1459
02:27:00,580 --> 02:27:04,100
unless they did they they recently delete in active accounts

1460
02:27:06,740 --> 02:27:08,820
did they recently delete in active accounts

1461
02:27:12,340 --> 02:27:18,900
no they're not gone I I I I um I log in once in a while I see them

1462
02:27:22,980 --> 02:27:26,900
the thing is she doesn't even remember her own password so the if she remembers

1463
02:27:27,540 --> 02:27:33,780
any like the fact if she remembers my webkin's password it would be like some sort of miracle

1464
02:27:35,780 --> 02:27:37,780
let me google it

1465
02:27:57,460 --> 02:27:57,780
what

1466
02:28:00,980 --> 02:28:09,780
when was this done

1467
02:28:27,380 --> 02:28:32,820
free accounts will be deleted after six month of inactivity paid accounts will be deleted

1468
02:28:32,820 --> 02:28:35,780
after 24 months of inactivity

1469
02:28:40,980 --> 02:28:43,780
what

1470
02:28:48,740 --> 02:28:50,980
from April 2nd 2019

1471
02:28:51,380 --> 02:28:57,860
I swear I've logged in after that

1472
02:29:02,340 --> 02:29:09,860
I swear I've logged in after that though

1473
02:29:10,180 --> 02:29:12,740
oh

1474
02:29:16,740 --> 02:29:20,740
man

1475
02:29:25,300 --> 02:29:26,260
2019

1476
02:29:29,700 --> 02:29:38,740
am I learning right now on stream that all my fucking webkins are done are dead

1477
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:42,740
so

1478
02:30:01,300 --> 02:30:02,740
I have so many

1479
02:30:10,580 --> 02:30:22,740
they're all dead

1480
02:30:26,660 --> 02:30:29,940
I keep trying but it's useless isn't it

1481
02:30:30,580 --> 02:30:32,820

1482
02:30:35,460 --> 02:30:40,660
I'm genuinely super sad about this all my fucking webkins are dead

1483
02:30:41,860 --> 02:30:44,820
I swear I've logged in after 2019

1484
02:30:51,220 --> 02:30:54,740
webkins don't die if we have to delete an account from our archives because a player

1485
02:30:54,740 --> 02:30:58,100
has abandoned it we put those pits up like for adoption so they can find you

1486
02:30:58,100 --> 02:31:08,980
shut up they're dead oh they're dead they've been they've been sent to the gulag

1487
02:31:14,100 --> 02:31:16,980
come on

1488
02:31:29,060 --> 02:31:30,980
oh

1489
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:54,980
that account information is not correct

1490
02:31:58,980 --> 02:32:00,980
I want to

1491
02:32:07,220 --> 02:32:09,780
I don't want to raise new ones I want my old webkins

1492
02:32:11,300 --> 02:32:14,660
I want my old webkins it's possible they emailed somebody but

1493
02:32:15,220 --> 02:32:19,140
you think I know the email that I used that email is from like

1494
02:32:21,140 --> 02:32:25,220
I don't want to say how many years ago but fucking I don't have access to whatever email

1495
02:32:25,220 --> 02:32:32,260
was used that email is if it even still exists which it probably doesn't

1496
02:32:36,020 --> 02:32:38,900
man I'm literally so sad right now all my weapons are gone

1497
02:32:43,860 --> 02:32:45,300
yes I'm sure I want to quit

1498
02:32:55,460 --> 02:32:57,460
you

1499
02:33:09,060 --> 02:33:12,900
do you think you would have tried to change the password to something else last time you logged in

1500
02:33:13,460 --> 02:33:14,420
I don't think so

1501
02:33:16,900 --> 02:33:22,100
email honestly should be around well if it is round I don't have access to it and I have no

1502
02:33:22,100 --> 02:33:27,300
way of getting access to it because my mom my mom most likely doesn't know it

1503
02:33:29,620 --> 02:33:38,180
you know my mom's not the type of like my mom's the type of mom to be like hey like to call me

1504
02:33:38,180 --> 02:33:43,940
and be like hey emmy why did you change my channel on the tv how do I change it back

1505
02:33:44,660 --> 02:33:49,380
like she doesn't know email passwords she doesn't know webkins passwords you know

1506
02:33:50,100 --> 02:33:56,980

1510
02:34:20,020 --> 02:34:26,180
