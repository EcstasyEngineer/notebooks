maybe I should talk quieter we can do like a little key ASMR I'm not okay I'm sick as the buns looking at me right here's my story yesterday it's not really story it's just something I want to tell you yesterday I was posted a picture on Twitter dot com of two are you gay well why are you acting so gay can't always catch streams live but I'm happy to watch when I can and sometimes even see toes keep up the great work sis thank you thank you for the tip it's okay you don't have to watch them live you don't have to be here I have I'm really thankful that you are here in the first place though so yesterday I posted a picture on Twitter of some toys wink wink and I tried them out yesterday you heard me you heard me try it yesterday the one I use well my hands are shaking the one I used for the audio that I posted yesterday was the pink one and I'm sorry to disappoint you for actually both toys I'm sorry to disappoint you pink one I couldn't figure out how to get it to work well because like from the shape of it it's supposed to like how am I supposed to describe this on YouTube so from this okay from the shape of it looks like it's supposed to like like like like it's like this shaped right so it looks like it's supposed to go like that right like inside but like it was just kind of like like I couldn't get it deep enough so it was kind of just like hanging out like like this instead of going like I need to rip this off to really give you a good visualization here alright alright so imagine this box is me right this is this is this is me and that's my underside so the toy is like this shaped right so I thought it would go in like that but I couldn't get it in to go like that it was kind of just hanging out like this it wasn't even like it's supposed to be like it was frustrating it still felt good but it was frustrating that's all I have to say any um any advice is appreciated please are the rats albino um Luna has red eyes but I don't think she's considered albino we getting more feet did I show you more feet by accident oh shit I'm really late on chat can we do this with shadow puppets what do you mean shadow puppets no it wasn't double it wasn't a double toy was it wait was it did I use it wrong please don't tell me I use the toy wrong that would suck I don't think so oh yeah right the wand so the black one was a wand I think I just received a faulty product because even though I charged it it still doesn't turn on good I'm such a fucking failure I charged it a lot and it still doesn't turn on I don't know what to do like I've I even looked at the instructions which I never do me instructions I mean okay I'll be looking at the instructions for this but I usually never look at the instructions so I think I just received a faulty product I know it's so disappointing does it require it does require an app and I did get the app and I did use the app and the app is really fun hey the app is so fun but um it wouldn't it just wouldn't turn on and it wouldn't connect so yeah that's a shame thank you for the burp readings maybe if you give us a demonstration we can help you figure it out I'm not giving you a demonstration wow dirty minded I think this is supposed to be a cutting board for me to use so I'm gonna cut it out should I use this like I feel like I need a flatter surface for this hello Esteban do you want to say hi come say hi to the viewers come here come on I'm say hi oh she's too shy okay fine no stop looking stop looking oh there she is also I saw some comments cuz I be looking at you guys I know I'm every single one of you doesn't matter where you're from I'd be looking at what you're saying and I saw some comments saying oh what she Esteban do you want me to cut you because you're playing a really dangerous game right now um I saw some comments saying what she she farted in her microphone that's gross I'm not watching streams anymore I don't want to play with you anymore good leave I don't want you in my stream anyways if you can't appreciate my forts I don't want you you're here for the girlfriend experience you think girls don't fart get out of here you think girls don't poop you're in for a real surprise you're in for a really Esteban look how cute she is I love her I love her so much I'm surprised Esteban is the most explorative yeah girls poop and girls fart and you gotta kind of just learn to deal with it and if you want to be my boyfriend you got to learn all about my pooping and farting she's on my shoulder right now unfortunately I will not be able to show you that oh you want to hear her sniff the camera I mean not the camera sniff the microphone that's right if it's in me I'm down for anything that's right that's what I want to hear isn't Esteban a male name dude it's a rat it's a fucking rat what do you even mean a male name it's a rat do you think she knows she's a girl do you think she hears me call her name do you think she hears me say the word Esteban and she thinks oh fuck that bitch she called me she named me after a man no it's just a rat who cares I don't care she's not gonna get bullied by the other rats who is gonna bully her the babies because they're the only ones with female names rats are very smart they're not they're not that smart they're not that smart she's not sensitive oh my god no absolutely not the sensitive ones are the babies Esteban is one of the least sensitive ones and I think you're I think you might need me another one Dennis is very shy that's why I didn't pick her up and show her to you but she's near me right now fish who you call an Esteban I am Princess Buttercup no her name is not Princess Buttercup her name is Esteban deal with it how'd you get your rats um oh my god it all started when I wanted a hamster and I looked up on google hamster videos or not on google but on youtube hamster videos and um well I was looking at videos of hamsters I learned that hamsters don't really care about their owners that much are these instructions I will keep this for instructions okay so I learned that hamsters don't really care about their owners that much and in my head I was like if I'm gonna get a pet and if it's gonna look this cute it's gotta care about me I'm sorry it's gotta care about me because if I'm gonna care about some cute little creature I wanted to care about me in return you know I was a little lonely yeah I was a little lonely and I needed a pet to love me back I wanted a pet that loved me so yeah so um I think I don't know how I just found out that some people kept rats as pets too when I was um when I was looking like you know looking through pet videos of small animals I debated on getting mice maybe but then I found out that mice also don't really are you stealing your shit I found out that mice also don't really like you back either so finally I landed on rats hamsters die in some weird ways oh my god they don't it's not that they die in weird ways they're just really neglected animals it's kind of depressing how neglected poor hamsters are are they gay why are you acting so gay thank you unlucky genius for the three dollars why do you keep why do you guys keep giving three dollars and 33 cents I keep seeing 333 is there a reason can you like not are you guys like in on it somehow you didn't see my shadow well yeah angel numbers oh it's one of the default options oh okay I was just wondering why that specific number I was like why is everyone giving three dollars and 33 cents thank you though thank you I appreciate you all right um anyways so fuck me oh my god I'm losing my voice holy shit hello hello wait hello okay I should probably talk quieter sorry it's gonna be an asmr stream it's an asmr stream now so um anyways um um as the one just fucking turned over my cup of water okay so um I landed on rats and I was like okay let me get a rat wait I can't speak Japanese I don't know which one to use shit wait do I use the yellow one but these are fries oh yeah these are fries okay um what was I talking about right I landed on rats and at first I was like okay let me go to the pet store and buy a rat well buy two rats because they need to be in pairs um but then I saw the prices at the pet store and I was like holy shit yeah no it's like $20 per rat are you shitting me am I willing to spend like thousands of dollars in vet in vet um fees of course of course of course am I willing to spend $20 on a rat no I'm not spending $20 on a rat so I went on Kijiji which is the Canadian version of um Craigslist um and I just happened to um what are you making I'm making candy I happened to be really lucky and I found um some random teenager that was giving away her two rats how much do I put is there a line just pick one up from the subway no how much do I put oh I use this to measure okay are you gay why are you acting so gay a couple of years ago I threatened my family with the purchase of five guinea pigs if we didn't finally get a dog after years of breaking promises long story story we got a dog how is getting a guinea pig a threat that's not a threat what do you mean threat oh you know what I can do what do you mean threaten my family thank you for the $420 though I think it was $420 that's not a threat I want guinea pigs guinea pigs was one of my options if I wasn't gonna get rats I was gonna get guinea pigs let me use this straw one right fuck oh fuck it won't come out god damn it okay oh this is a bad idea should I just dip maybe I'll just dip but five of them five guinea pigs sounds fine are you kidding me I love five guinea pigs I already have four rats so yeah I found a random teenager um who was giving away their rats on could Gigi and that started my journey of rats and ever since then I've gotten more an estaban and deniser from a rat rescue they're not they're not from kijiji yeah and pixie and luna are from kijiji though I'm actually allergic to guinea pigs oh no that's a sad that's a sad sad depressing life yes they do need rat friends rats do get lonely is denison menace absolutely why did why do you think I called her den is yeah I tried to do that but um this straw is like stuck in there it has like um a stopper so I can't take it out yeah no it's not a stanley cup it's just a random cup the upkeep for five is never ending they also fight constantly wait guinea pigs fight oh fuck I'm not even paying attention to what I'm doing here I don't I don't think this is enough water this is nowhere near enough water damn it what if I just or I guess I can do it I thought guinea pigs liked each other that's why you get multiple because they want to be together stop making imie excuse her canadianness what do you mean so get the rats and pairs if you get them okay perfect for needing them catch on in deku and then that way you can make them kiss and roleplay as kachan and dick that would be so funny it's already gonna be botched what why this it's not botched I still feel like it's not enough um I still feel like it's not enough though and not enough water kachan you have some cheese on your lips is that lips kachan you have some cheese on your

there's like Reddit stories or here I'll tell you multiple stories because I just thought of another one did you guys see the freaking post about that guy on the internet that like he made a post on the internet right and he was like he posted a picture of his um he posted a picture of his leg I think and it was covered in bruises and he was like I don't know he's the the caption was like days blah blah blah blah day something um of trying to micro dose bullets until I'm bullet proof it days something I've tried to micro dose bullets until I'm bullet proof fucking hell open oh my god okay and his leg was covered in like scars and then eventually he like posted another update and he was like guys I went up I don't remember the guns that he was using or like the bullets that he was using he literally said it was working too he was like my um my bullets have no longer been like breaking skin okay get your nose out of there okay I need two of these he said my bullets have no longer been breaking skin so I'm gonna move up to the next like gun I don't know next gun or next bullets he might be onto something right and so um that's what he did and then he ended up in the he ended up in the hospital after that yeah next caliber I don't know bro was bullet maxing he ended up in the hospital after that and he was like guys I'm gonna stop micro dosing bullets and then he started okay um sorry I'm just rewatching the stream to see the clip of of S1 trying to um take my my packaging why am I so far behind on stream okay well whatever guys tell me if you see my face okay that's embarrassing but anyways um what was I talking about we didn't even see your hair I was hoping for a hair reveal I'm spilling water everywhere um why does my stream so delayed on my end what the hell okay there we go right micro dosing bullets um um um so he went up to the next caliber and then he was like guys he ended up in the hospital he was like guys I can't do this anymore I'm gonna stop but if anyone wants to pick up like pick up my my challenge like basically just saying like guys you should try this too um I just thought that was hilarious and then he started being like an asshole about the nurse and saying like yeah I'm gonna fuck the nurse in the hospital which yeah sure yeah of course the guy who would try to micro dose bullets would be creepy like that no face just be perfect how I like it S1 has been waiting on the phone so that may be the uh walking on the phone yeah that's true okay but was the nurse hot though I don't know why are you asking it doesn't even matter it doesn't matter if she was hot do you like her huh are you looking for a girlfriend in the nurse you know being a streamer probably pays just as much as being a nurse these days so maybe you should just stick with me okay why isn't my race racing the way I want it to race only in me only in me perfect perfect ill women are you gay why are you acting so gay right now I need more water I caught my socks on oh so it's not gay there you go it means the best sister in the world and she's the only girl I need in my life and I love her a lot good job good job you're doing good I've trained you well right what was I saying so the other story I had was of I think it's a Reddit story I'm not sure it was of this girl who was man I wish I could remember I really wish I had better memories so I could tell you tell you about it better but it was from this girl and I think she had this weird obsession with like people you know giving her attention for being sick so she would pretend to be sick online um and I think it got to the point where she was like every female I come across wait what I see every female I come across as a potential partner what is wrong with you why would you say that to me I'm the only potential partner shut up do you want this up your ass because you're acting like it right now or even better this one okay anyways so this girl would pretend to be sick online and I think she would um um Fixie's here come here don't be scared come on come closer come closer she's so scared it's okay come closer come to the light do you see her is it all oh I'm sorry you're scared she's oh hi baby every time I move she gets scared okay bye bye okay great did you recently adopt her is that why she's scared um female rats tend to be more skittish I notice that male rats just in general um she is also recently adopted yeah so she hasn't been outside of her cage much this is like probably the second time I've let her free roam around my entire room so yeah she's a little spooked um what was I talking about right right so I think what she would do is I feel like I need to get closer let's get let's get up close and personal here um what she would do is that she would um pick at her leg I guess which same same but she would pick at her leg and like at one point it got um yo don't like the don't don't like the scissors at one point it got infected and she kept picking at it because you know she was like posting photos online I guess and um it got to the point where she had like an entire hole in her leg like through her leg like you could see through her leg because if she got like it got so bad because it got infected I think by the way don't take these stories as like 100% like this is what happened like these are stories I've seen on the internet but I might be fucking them up because I don't remember them correctly okay so just know that um yeah she got a hole through stop touching me it might be a little spooky um she got a hole through her leg and I saw the picture and it was so scary yeah I'm on Chow's and that's what it's called I can't believe that Amy's friend did that what my friend no I don't know this person it was an internet story what do you mean Amy wait wait wait wait and I spilled more water okay no it's just an internet story rock maxing literally rock maxing you're scaring us no no I don't pick at my leg like that not to that degree absolutely not not even close not even close she it was just scary it was scary at a co-worker who's leg got infected and they kept scratching at it they were told to stop and they ended up losing their leg holy fucking shit dude that's literally something I would do oopsies that's literally something I would do I would do that shit I would do that bullshit that's literally me oh my god that's scary you're scared now you're scaring me Amy you don't happen to have any holes in your legs do you no I don't I don't don't lose your legs I promise I promise I will I will I will I think I'll stop biting my lip I still be biting my lips too if you cannot this would you let would uh if you cannot this I would let you pick me good I would I would pick you okay that's my triangle race shape my stepdad knew a guy who kept amputating parts of his toes he just chopped off every once in a while wait he just chopped off a bit every once in a while oh my god he's trying to make himself grow his limbs back isn't he that's what he was trying to do he was trying to get his limbs to grow back so if he chopped off a little at a time it would slowly grow back dude what a freaking Elon Musk who uh what other smart people uh Elon Musk isn't smart um what other smart people will Albert Einstein who I only know that guy is this what I'm supposed to use it is yeah regeneration maxing micro dosing dismemberment so funny micro dosing dismemberment okay I think this so I fill up all of these okay I'm gonna fill up I'm gonna fill them up what does this say it says nutty I was just saying what it is okay I'm just gonna pull a little bit then and he hates Elon he ruined twitter he freaking shadowbanned me from twitter of course I hate him it's okay though my twitter is okay

there's like people who I'm just gonna put the rest in here I think that's right there's like people who identify as now we're just talking about mental illness at this point what a great topic for me I'm kidding I'm not gonna talk about my own but um there's like people who I saw I saw it on like those tlc shows there's people who identify as like handicapped and then they will literally handicap themselves to to to be the handicap that they like identified with like the lady that like put bleach in her eyes so that she um so that she was blind because she wanted to be blind isn't that crazy I don't know I think I need to start dipping because this is no longer getting deep enough in nut bars they are nut bars how many how many do I put how much oh please don't stick please don't stick okay she stole my race for a little bit but I got it back um do I just put a little bit I don't get it did I do it did I do it and then do I put the rest in here oh shit I wasn't supposed to put oops I wasn't supposed to put any water in I identify as Imi's brother you are my brother you don't need to identify as that the fury that amputated his his hands so he could have paws what that guy in japan who had surgery done on him to become a dog while they're fighting I think you're thinking I think I'm thinking of but I think we're thinking of the same guy was I even supposed to add water to this I don't think I was supposed to add water to this I think I was literally just supposed to stamp it oh I'm a fucking dumbass now there's hair on my race average makima fan there's your nori that looks gross I was just supposed to stamp it wasn't I and then I was supposed to roll these in the black powder so that they would be the ears for the ew this looks so gross keep the hair in guys don't be disgusting ew ew oh it's so wet and then I have to add the face how am I gonna add the oh god oh this is gonna be cursed there's his face um oopsies it's so funny to see what the mods delete I will write by the way if there's any mods watching I will write um I will write a guidelines for you for the chat I will do that I will do that very soon so that way you know what to what to do I'm sorry I've been like I've been I've been um neglecting you um okay and now the last one is this one thanks for the hard words yes thank you is this does this have a hole in it I'm not gonna have a taste no and then this other person that also identified as a handicap like wanted to be in a wheelchair or something this is gross oh wait I have a I have a garbage can what am I doing they wanted to be in a wheelchair or something so they um they laid down on train tracks and had the train like cut their legs off okay now she's going in my trash and then the train did it because of course it would um how many do I put in here one yeah no I'm putting more than one do not resuscitate at that point I mean like why would the train do that why would the train do that is the train stupid is the train stupid why would it do that I mean can you be Japanese a little bit I took eight months of Japanese class but that doesn't mean I can read it well and also I haven't like practiced in a long time that's why I didn't name it as a as a language that I know because I don't really know it I can try reading what it says this says dekiyakari right dekiyakari oh you can't even see it I don't know what dekiyakari means though this says tsukuro tsukuro or bento there you go my very limited Japanese knowledge oh ready to eat oh that's what it means enjoy your food ready to eat whoa first step stop watching dumb shut up I will do as I please with my anime and no one's allowed to tell me what otherwise I mean studying Japanese here gana and katakana is easy kanji is hard as fuck I find kanji to be easier because oftentimes like there you can find pictures in the kanji that help you remember what it means um yeah but that's just me that's just me being a little special I'm pretty sure kanji is based off of pictures anyways so it's not even just me it's just facts there are a lot of kanji you're right you're right there are I think I think we're we're almost there um so now I just put it in this bag kanji is easier if you learn slash you know Chinese that's true that's true that's very true because I think they have the same meanings oh this is the noodle oh okay okay okay all right are you ready to plate the food because it's about to be plated get ready to eat go wash your hands I'm about to noodle you up that's right I think I gotta push it in more or here let me cut it let me cut the bottom you know it's so gross and slimy you you all right so where does the noodles go I want to I want to copy it I want to copy the the packaging wait what are these meatballs wait when did we make meatballs oh I was supposed to make meatballs before the noodles okay we'll make me we'll make the meatballs last all right so here is I'll put the noodles first so here's your noodles come on um um go out come on oh so it won't come out um so yummy yummy in my tummy it looks like a pile of shit it looks like a pile of shit gross yummy in my tummy don't you just want to lick that up okay and then we have our our our rice our rice panda oh then we have our rice panda cute let me bring this closer there and then we have all right our broccoli how do I get the broccoli it broke a little bit sorry about that there's your broccoli this looks so disgusting and then we have what do we have next all this thing um yeah how do I it's so slimy okay I'm supposed to roll this thing up but it won't I think I put too much water it's falling apart oh guys I just picked my nose can you clean my finger for me okay what is this supposed to be is this supposed to be like yum or something okay okay there's the I don't know I don't even know what that's supposed to be and then there's the other rice I think the hot dog is oh it's supposed to be rolled egg really I think the hot dog's gonna be the only one that actually looks good no it doesn't look good this is what a fetus looks like at six weeks you murder okay sorry let's not get political um okay great now that's all that's left is the meatballs um okay um this is water in for our Swedish meatballs along with I don't know why we're making meatballs for a Japanese bento but we're doing it so I'm trying to think of some crazy some other crazy shit internet shit I've seen there's a lot apparently one guy tried to recreate uh I forget which youtuber it was some vtuber's pee that's why I said that's why I posted my um my what does your oh she smell like post and I said okay use this to recreate my pee he like tracked like what kind of food she ate too which you know and then he would drink it while watching her like while watching her what's her name Sui Suisei Suisei Suisei yeah the Sui piss yeah that that's okay I think that's so funny like like I know some people genuinely are really creeped out by that I think it's the most funniest shit ever I think it's hilarious all right there's our meatballs I don't have a toothpick to put in the meatballs like they have here a toothpick but it's you know it's I don't even need a toothpick to be honest because it already looks just like the packaging basically like oops corporate wants you to find the difference between these two pictures they're the same picture it looks exactly like the packaging um yeah what a romantic little picnic date we have here it looks perfect thank you don't you just want to I don't want to eat it I'm scared I'm not going to eat it I'm not going to eat it I don't want to eat it I'm scared who needs real food when you have me to cook you this eat the sausage oh I kind of have to don't I I kind of joked about eating it can we take a
