1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
Could you survive living in France?

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,160
Probably not, let's be honest, no foreigner could.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,680
They're unhinged over there.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,080
But let's test your French knowledge anyways.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,120
What is dobe?

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,120
It means to stink.

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,040
Come on, you should be familiar with that one.

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,600
How about le toad à la naix?

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,920
It means piece of cake.

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,920
But if you were to directly translate it,

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,600
it means to put your finger up your nose.

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,000
I don't know how they got piece of cake from that.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,560
And finally, what is lâcher une caisse?

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,360
It means to fart.

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,760
And now you're a real Frenchie.

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,800
Good luck out there.

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,880
And don't be scared, they can smell your fear.
