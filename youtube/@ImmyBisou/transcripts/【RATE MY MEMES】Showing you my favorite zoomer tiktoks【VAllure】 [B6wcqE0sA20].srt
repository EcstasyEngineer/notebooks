1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,700
Yeah.

2
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,840
I have a confession to make today, to all of you.

3
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:20,640
Would you still love me if I was disgusting, if I was nasty, if I was gross, dirty, stinky?

4
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
Yeah?

5
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Yeah?

6
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
You would?

7
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,640
You wouldn't go back on that, right?

8
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:39,640
You wouldn't change your mind after you hear what I have to say, would you?

9
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,640
No?

10
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Well, then I guess I can say it.

11
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,640
Pin pals?

12
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,640
I shot myself this morning!

13
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,640
I shot myself!

14
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,640
I took a big ol' boopie in my pants!

15
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,640
Okay, so you still love me, right?

16
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,640
Take it back!

17
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
Say it!

18
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Say it!

19
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Say it, say yes!

20
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,640
It doesn't matter the context, I'll tell you the context, but I need you to say yes first.

21
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Okay, okay, good.

22
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,640
Okay, I'll tell you the context!

23
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,640
Oh fuck, no!

24
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,640
That's it, that's the stream.

25
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,640
That's it, I'm done, that's all I have to say for today!

26
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Okay, okay.

27
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,640
I'll tell you the context.

28
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,640
So, you know how I said I was sick yesterday?

29
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Well, today I was just sitting on my computer looking at TikToks to show you for the stream.

30
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,640
And I felt like I needed to fart.

31
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:29,640
So, you know, as one does when they feel like they need to fart, I farted.

32
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:36,640
Um, little did I know that it was not truly a fart.

33
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:43,640
It was going to be a shark.

34
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,640
Ew, ew.

35
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,640
I sharded my pants!

36
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,640
Way more than a little came out, it was so gross, it was so like...

37
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,640
Should I go into the texture?

38
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,640
I don't have a shit kink, I don't have a shit kink.

39
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:15,640
Don't, I don't have a shit kink, please don't start like thinking that I do, okay?

40
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,640
I'm not into poo poo poo poo, okay?

41
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,640
I'm eating sausage rolls.

42
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,640
I just thought it was a funny story to tell you.

43
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,640
And you would tell me if you shot yourself too, right?

44
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:41,640
I want you to tell me, I want to hear all of your embarrassing stories.

45
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:48,640
And I'm also drinking coke.

46
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Right.

47
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,640
No, I don't want pictures of your shit!

48
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:02,640
No, we're not that close yet, we're not that close yet for you to send me pictures of your poop.

49
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:15,640
Right, before I start, thank you to the person who got me a drawing tablet because now I can do an art stream.

50
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,640
And I really want to design a 2.0.

51
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Now, I think some people misunderstood me the first time when I said I wanted to make a 2.0.

52
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,640
So let me clarify myself.

53
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,640
What are sausage rolls?

54
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,640
It's sausage with bread inside.

55
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,640
Poop tributes instead of cum tributes?

56
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,640
I mean, I shot on the toilet to the thought of you today.

57
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,640
I love you.

58
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,640
Right.

59
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,640
So, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah.

60
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,640
So I, it's not like I don't like this design.

61
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:58,640
I think it's really cute, I really like it, but also like, you know, I, as an artist, I'm very picky.

62
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
And I want to be emo.

63
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Um, but that doesn't mean I'm going to like unlollify myself, lollify my, unlollify myself.

64
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
I'll still look the same.

65
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:14,640
I'm not going to give myself, myself like giant tits and ass and make myself like five foot seven or anything.

66
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,640
I'm going to look the same mostly.

67
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,640
I just, well, not the same, but like, uh, uh, uh, uh.

68
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,640
Like the character itself will remain the same, you know?

69
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,640
So yeah.

70
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
I want to do that next week.

71
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,640
I think that would be really fun.

72
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Yeah, like a hot topic.

73
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,640
We're going to design it next week together.

74
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:46,640
I really want to.

75
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
Could have an opi toggle.

76
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
I don't think I'm going to do that.

77
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,640
I don't think people want me to do that.

78
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,640
You know, I'm the special one in this, in this group.

79
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,640
I'm the special one because I'm the only one without boobs.

80
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
Okay.

81
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,640
I think that's all I had to say.

82
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,640
Oh, piercings would be really fun.

83
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Oh, now you got me thinking where the piercing could go.

84
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,640
So, so, so, um, no, I'm not turning myself into a furry.

85
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,640
Absolutely not.

86
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,640
So I picked out.

87
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,640
Let me make sure sound is okay.

88
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Should I go to the gaming screen?

89
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
Yeah.

90
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,640
If you want to give me scars, that's fine.

91
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Like, um, you can like make a, sorry, I am still sick.

92
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,640
I showed myself this morning.

93
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,640
If you want to do like a Pinterest board or something.

94
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Um, and you can send me the link to it through marshmallow.

95
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
That's cool.

96
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
Obviously.

97
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
Yeah.

98
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,640
I think you can send the link.

99
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Um, go ahead.

100
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,640
Okay.

101
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,640
So RGB boom tattoo.

102
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,640
Maybe I can make it glow.

103
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:29,640
But apparently, apparently I learned very, very, uh, recently that a womb tattoo that

104
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,640
glows is a womb tattoo that's been, or no, a womb tattoo that glows is a womb that's

105
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,640
been, um, fertilized.

106
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
And I didn't know that.

107
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:50,640
So I feel like, how long should I make by you?

108
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,640
Should I make my womb tattoo glow?

109
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,640
Is that what you want?

110
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
Okay.

111
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,640
Um, so how am I going to do this?

112
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
I downloaded a bunch of Tik Toks.

113
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:13,640
It's probably not enough to fill up the whole time, but basically what I want to do here,

114
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:20,640
well, I'm eating my sausage rolls.

115
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:31,640
Um, gender bench version of myself.

116
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:39,640
Um, I don't see why not because it's still me, but also I don't want to, I don't really

117
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,640
want to be gender bent.

118
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:48,640
I feel like if I'm going to put all this effort into a model, I want to be like me.

119
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,640
With two inch, shut the fuck up about my two inch cock.

120
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
It's way bigger than that.

121
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,640
Someone a long time ago, like, head cannon that my dick is two inches long, and now everyone's

122
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,640
just going for it and saying I have a two inch long penis.

123
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,640
It's, and they gave I see a seven inch long penis.

124
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
Like what the hell?

125
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
That's not fair.

126
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:26,640
I should be the one with a seven inch long dick.

127
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Two inches is big.

128
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Oh, I'm going to hold my, I'm going to hold your hand when I, when I tell you this, but

129
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,640
it's not.

130
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
Okay.

131
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,640
How am I going to do this?

132
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,640
That's not right.

133
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
Okay.

134
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,640
Right.

135
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
So.

136
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
All right.

137
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,640
If you see my full name and address.

138
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
Okay.

139
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
Okay.

140
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
Okay.

141
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
Okay.

142
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Okay.

143
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
Okay.

144
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Okay.

145
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Okay.

146
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Okay.

147
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
Okay.

148
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Okay.

149
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
Okay.

150
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Okay.

151
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Okay.

152
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
Okay.

153
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Okay.

154
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,640
Okay.

155
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,640
Okay.

156
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
Okay.

157
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
All right.

158
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,640
If you see my full name and address, please close your eyes.

159
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,640
Oh that's not it.

160
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Okay.

161
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,640
Why does VeeTube studio work?

162
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,640
Why does it say that it's capturing VeeTube studio?

163
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,640
What?

164
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:31,640
I'll put it over there.

165
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,640
Okay.

166
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,120
Okay, that doesn't work wrong thing

167
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
Okay, let's not do that

168
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,200
Oh, there we go there we go

169
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
Oh

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,360
She's an iPhone or what makes you know what makes you say that

171
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Wait, did you see that I have iPhone connected? Oh, yeah, of course. I have my oh wait now you can see everything

172
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,200
Is there nothing anything sus in there

173
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,280
No, of course I have an iPhone connected. I'm using a freaking model. All right

174
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,180
I'm using a vtuber model. Of course. I have an iPhone. There we go. There it is. Okay, and now the sound we just need sound

175
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,240
This one

176
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,640
Okay, well if I you know accidentally make it too loud, I'm sorry. Yeah, let me turn off the background music

177
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:53,320
Yeah, thank you for the suggestion. I found his trash. Well, it's good for tracking vtubers. Unfortunately

178
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
I

179
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
Right

180
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,840
So how this is gonna work is I'm gonna show you a

181
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Tiktok and

182
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,040
I want now these are all my favorite tiktoks from like the past few weeks

183
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,800
I've curated curated my folder here of my favorites. So I want you

184
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,180
I want you to rate them. Yeah

185
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,840
You're the one doing the meme review

186
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,880
Okay

187
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,520
So, yeah, I want you to read every single one

188
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,480
I curated it just for you, right? I think they're funny

189
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Okay, so

190
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,280
Guys seriously, how do I get my roommate's boyfriend to stop serenading her in my presence?

191
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,680
And then they fucking go in for a snuggle. That's okay

192
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,960
That's really all

193
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,600
This is why I'm happy that my mom never forced me to live on campus with a roommate because this is what I imagine it's like

194
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Absolutely no shame

195
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,880
Absolutely no shame just in front of the roommate the poor girl

196
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,960
If I was her I'd be really pissed because I hate seeing happy cobbles in front of me

197
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,040
Okay, next one next one next one. I do work here. Yes, I do. Can I help you you work here? Yes

198
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:36,560
How may I help you? I'm glad somebody does I'm looking for a kentia palm. Okay, kentia palm specifically

199
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,280
You work at a plant nursery. I'm gonna make a bold assumption that you know what that is kentia palm

200
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,400
Yeah, let me look at our system just so I can see if we have it in stock

201
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Sir sir

202
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,000
Hello, sir, we're still looking. Okay. We're still looking for that kentia palm. We have one in the back

203
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,400
They're putting it in my car right now. Oh, excellent. I'm glad you found me 20 minutes to find it. Oh

204
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,120
20 minutes. Oh, no, I didn't know I was gonna go on a wild goose chase today

205
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,720
But I guess he's making it sound like it's your fault to let you know. Well, sorry about that, sir

206
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,520
Yeah, I just want to let you know. Yeah, really sorry, sir

207
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Sorry you had to go through that. Oh

208
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,000
Hi, sir. Do you need help moving it to your car? There he is

209
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,240
What are you talking about? I deliberately sold me the wrong tree the biggest fucking waste of time. Come on, dad

210
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,600
Please calm down

211
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:31,000
My son, dad, he'd like to talk to you. Hello, my son. You said a nurse speaker. Hi, sir

212
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,920
I work here at the nursery. I was just trying to tell your dad that we do have a kentia palm

213
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:40,000
Oh my god, the face. You're still interested in buying it. You hear that dad. They have it. There isn't a problem

214
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,000
Hey, man, I'm really sorry about this. Oh, don't need to apologize. This happens all the time

215
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:53,840
He looks constipated. Okay. So the only reason I show you this is because I've worked in customer service and this felt very

216
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
Relatable to me

217
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,120
Five out of ten

218
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,400
Come on. That was the least of six. That was the least of six. Maybe sharding out

219
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,400
Sharding out of ten. I'm gonna shard on you next time every time I fart. I'm gonna aim it towards you

220
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,200
I'm gonna turn around and aim it towards you and that way if I sure it's gonna be on you

221
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,600
If you've worked customer service, you know how relatable this is okay old people like

222
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
They make everything your fault

223
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,980
Basically, oh, this was priced wrong. It was your fault and you need to fix it for me right now

224
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,080
I

225
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
Don't think I have any I

226
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:44,160
Do have like one guy who came in once I used to work at a grocery store. Oh

227
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,980
My god, I used to work at a grocery store

228
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,060
A long time ago as a cashier and this one guy came up to me and he was like

229
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,320
How much are the chicken like the roasted chickens and I was like, I don't know

230
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:10,000
Like I may be a long time ago when boomers worked that that's like the norm for cashiers to know the prices of everything

231
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,520
But I said, I don't know but you can go look yourself. So he comes back with a chicken. I

232
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,360
Scan it and he's like no no no no no no a couple weeks ago. The chicken was like 699

233
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,080
Why is it 899 now or something like that and I'm in my head. I'm thinking well

234
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
I didn't work here a couple weeks ago

235
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
So I don't know so I just told him like

236
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,360
I don't know. Do you want me to call a manager?

237
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,440
And he straight up said no, don't call a manager. The chicken should be 699

238
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Anyways in the end, I think he ended up leaving out of anger because he didn't get his chicken

239
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,560
But

240
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,240
I don't I don't like boomers. It's called inflation literally

241
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,600
I carefully peeled off the label on my Cosmo Stanley tumbler

242
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,160
The packaging was so cute. I had to get it laminated

243
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,800
Fucking water top and I rolled it up and tied it with a scrunchie

244
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,000
And heated it with a blow dryer

245
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,640
To tie it with the scrunchie. I added some glue dots to the back

246
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,600
And now I can use my tumbler. I'll give you context on this one. I'm messing up the label. I'll give you context

247
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,280
Okay, I didn't realize this one might require context. So

248
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,120
Basically, do you know those Stanley cups that are really popular?

249
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,960
This tick tock is using the sound of a girl

250
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,360
Who laminated the wrap like the cardboard wrap around her new Stanley cups

251
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,960
So that way she could keep it on the cup like forever

252
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,360
It's like a weird obsession with Stanley cups people people collect like

253
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,360
Like hundreds of them evolve all the colors. Did you know that?

254
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,760
Free lead poisoning. Wait, does it have lead poisoning?

255
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,840
Not what does it have lead poisoning? Does it have lead?

256
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,120
And so this person just made fun of them by using an ocean spray bottle

257
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,760
On my cosmos Stanley and just and just laminated

258
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,120
I had to get it laminated the packaging was so cute. I asked to get it. I have dated and tied it with a scrunchie

259
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,680
Bruh

260
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
Not based, huh? Okay

261
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
Oi oi oi

262
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,720
Hey snuggle bear. What's taking you so damn long?

263
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Sorry

264
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,080
You damn nerd you could have just called me how would have picked you up already milady

265
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,320
Oh

266
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,680
Yeah, well, I guess I just don't want to disturb you. Yeah, whatever

267
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,840
I'm hunting for new ops right now, but I can wait till tomorrow if you need me to

268
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,880
I can come and get you my sweet sugar plum. Just let me know

269
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,720
Don't worry. I'm fine. I'll protect you with my life my darling kitten whiskers

270
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,720
Let me know if that damn buck an uber driver gives you any trouble

271
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
I can take care of him

272
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,400
I know you can't alpha, but please stop thinking about exploding the drive. I'll be the judge of that

273
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,280
You remember what happened the last uber driver, right?

274
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,240
Yeah, it was a pretty grim sight

275
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,640
One thing I'm gonna do it's finish the damn job

276
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,480
Well, anyways princess. I'm gonna keep practicing my lethal explosion technique until you get here

277
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:43,200
Hold on. I just realized that my I need to change something about the desktop audio hold on

278
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
desktop audio

279
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
Okay there

280
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
10 out of 10 5 out of 10

281
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
It's supposed to be cringe on purpose

282
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,560
Okay, my glorious emperor. I'll see you very soon. See you soon snuggle bear

283
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,400
You want me to call you my little kitten whiskers

284
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,040
It's it's one of those cringe like ladies use this if you ever feel unsafe

285
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,000
If you ever feel unsafe in an uber 2 out of 10

286
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,920
What I like this person this person makes really funny bakugo um cringe stuff

287
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,000
It's supposed to be cringe on you on on purpose on purpose zero out of 10

288
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Oh

289
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,720
You don't understand real cringe bruh

290
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,600
The ones who are saying nine out of 10 and 10 out of 10 are valid. Thank you

291
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
Do you have a cold?

292
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,640
Okay, go

293
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,680
You know my sister had a baby and I took it over because she passed away

294
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
And then the baby left

295
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,560
Lost his legs and its arms

296
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
And now it's nothing but a stomp

297
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
I

298
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Got a cough

299
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,880
All right context of that one

300
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,640
It's from the movie. Uh, was it called shark tail?

301
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,720
And then the baby lost its legs and now it's nothing but a stomp

302
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,200
More context of this one. How is she even human? Is she they said at the start

303
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,640
She said do you have a cold and then I guess the mom lost her voice from a cold

304
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,880
So she was able to recreate the shrimp voice

305
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:47,920
You know my sister had a baby my sister had a baby. Okay. I'm glad you like that one. I'm glad you guys like that one

306
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,800
You're hard to please

307
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Okay, this one's funny

308
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,240
I hate myself

309
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,840
I had a wish so much

310
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,200
It would that I was never born

311
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,920
I'm so stupid stupid stupid

312
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,160
Me

313
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,320
Oh my god, that little me in the corner just happy

314
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,720
He's like drawing everything with the surprise face. Oh my god

315
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
That's so cute

316
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
Relatable out of 10

317
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,920
For sure

318
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,680
Were you guys depressed at 10 years old? I feel like that's kind of young. I feel like not even I was depressed at that age

319
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,920
Literally me

320
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
I

321
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,320
Wait, does it say the date 10 years old at 2016 wait in 2016 how old is that?

322
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,920
Wait, how old is 10 years? Oh, I need a calculator

323
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
How how old is

324
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,880
Oh, you fucking bitch exposing me using the calculator. Okay, wait, so it's

325
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,680
So it's 20 24

326
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
You minus 20 16

327
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,360
So that was

328
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,320
Wait, how do I do the math for this 18 now?

329
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,560
If they were

330
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,760
All right. Yeah, it was 10 years ago. Right. Right. Right. Okay. They're 18 now. Right. Right. Real. Okay. Okay. Okay

331
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,800
Can you believe that I'm graduating from college in a few days because I can't

332
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
Okay

333
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,320
Okay, no, no wait not graduating from college not graduating from from retubing

334
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,520
Okay, that's why I might not be funny if you don't know french

335
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:24,400
I just thought the voice was funny. Yes, he's supposed to cry. Oh, no, what did you say? What the fuck dude step the fuck up

336
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,760
I can really understand what he's saying anyways

337
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:39,360
Okay, you like that one good good good good good

338

339
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,880
Next meme

340
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
Like he literally jumps onto the car

345
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,200
And then falls off the other side just to open the door for her

346
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:31,280

Oh, I'm eating

348
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,960
That reminds me I probably shouldn't have said that I won that gymnastics award

349
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,640
I didn't realize how easy it is to find

350
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
My name

351
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,000

352
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,120
If you know enough information about me from just me saying that I want a gymnastics award

353
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,960
Oh well

354
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,120

He's so supportive

358
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,360
He's so what a supportive boyfriend you would react like that too, right, right?

359
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,760
Yeah, she she um

360
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,120
She puts salt on a spoon

361
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,640
And and just drenched it in a little bit of

362
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,800
Of the soup and fed it to him

363
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,280
Of course it's bad, but it doesn't matter if it's bad you're supposed to react nicely

364
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,200
A hard out of 10 it should be a 10 out of 10

365
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,360
I feel like you're I feel like you're trying to dodge the question by saying hard out of 10

00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,200
God oh good grief that's horrific

370
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,520
Okay, I just like that one because of the scream at the end

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
Okay, it wasn't cut but

380
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,680
I don't know what she's trying to do with it

381
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
I don't know what she's trying to do with the frog

382
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,920
Make this like

383
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,200

384
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,040
She's trying to move it. Is that what she said? Sorry, I know the audio is like really um

It was it sounds like she's gonna say I didn't know that that fucking frogs made this sound or something

389
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:31,280
That frog is crisp. I think frogs don't really a lot of frogs don't really go ribbit ribbit. They go like they make other noises

390
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,440
That was cute though. I like animal tiktoks. You'll see

391
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,320
All right

392
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,200
This one is also very relatable in this economy

393
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,120
I don't even know if I could afford that much water in this economy

394
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,880

Tell the 10 10 10. Thank you

403
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,320
Zero out of 10 too pricey. Okay. That's that's understandable. That's understandable understand if some of you um

404
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,320
Puvos can't afford such fine dining

405
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,800
Crap oh no way

505
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,800
And

506
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,120
Yeah

507
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,680
What the hell just happened and

508
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,160
Like two seconds and it's gone. You have got to be kidding me

509
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,360
This is not even funny

510
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,520
Seriously, oh my god

511
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,840
It is funny it is funny. I'm sorry

512
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,480
It's fine just be on it

513
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,800
Read the last thing you can't do that in Minecraft. You don't have saves in Minecraft like that

514
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,640
Fire spread was bad. This was pre alpha

515
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,960
What

516
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,360
Are you calling me a pro-minecrafter or yourself a pro-minecrafter? I am not a pro-minecrafter

517
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,760
Yeah, I thought someone said like oh, I bet Amy didn't actually put together her Minecraft world or her mods

518
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,200
Excuse me. You are not giving me enough credit

519
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:29,520
I worked very hard putting together all those mods and putting together that entire world. Everything was me

520
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,640
Everything was me

521
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,200
I worked very hard on that

522
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,080
I wanted to have an interesting debut and I I don't know how to do many things and I was inspired by dr

523
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:53,440
Nova E and how she like went went inside her her own brain. I thought that was really cool and I wanted to do something like that

524
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,960
But I didn't want to like

525
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,400
I know I didn't want to commission anyone to do something like that for me. I thought it would be really complicated

526
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
So I just did it myself

527
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,960
You're welcome. You did a very good job. Thank you. Thank you for all the praises. Thank you

528
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,440
Um

529
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,400
No, no, no, I didn't I didn't take the ASMR stream down yesterday

530
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:25,200
I got taken down by youtube for sexual content. If any of you missed the ASMR stream yesterday and you want to watch it still, um

531
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,440
It's on my twitter

532
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:36,400
I have a link to it on twitter. Just scroll through and you should find the tweet pretty fast good girl

533
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,400
Oh

534
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,680
Next week what's up kittens today. I'm gonna be filming a get ready with me

535
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,560
Hey, this is so freaking kawaii sugoi

536
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,920
Wait, what was that? Call me chihuahua, call neko

537
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,200
Oh, oh my gosh

538
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,200
I

539
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,680
Like this Bakugo

540
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,240
We're literally twins look at us

541
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,920
I don't even know what he's saying

542
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,920
No, of course, it's not real

543
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,920
You guys are giving this low ratings, but you don't know that this is how I act when I'm alone, you don't you really don't

544
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,960
This is how I act when I'm alone

545
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,200
So if you're giving this a low rating then you're gonna fucking hate meeting me

546
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,760
Zero please make it stop. Have I seen a husband out there? No

547
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:13,440
I am not a husband. I still act like this. Thank you. Thank you

548
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,160
It's it's funny

549
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,600
Okay, I'll move on to to the next one because it's it's cringe apparently

550
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Okay

551
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,280
I don't understand

552
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,800
I I don't know if this is serious

553
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,880
Oh

554
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,400
I don't know if this is serious or not like I can't tell

555
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,160
He's not even screaming

556
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,080
He's just wheezing now

557
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,640
Yeah

558
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,200
Oh

559
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,400
All right, that was terrible that was torture that was real cringe

560
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,760
He needed to take some local lessons

561
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:46,160
Okay, so I'm pet sitting this cat and uh Shiloh keep doesn't really like me if I try to go near her

562
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,840
She will kind of like

563
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,480
Yet edge herself away and like leave

564
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,600
However, I did find out

565
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,480
That she will approach me and let me pet her if I'm in a specific cosplay

566
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,520
I cannot believe

567
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,640
I

568
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:21,280
Still can't believe me cosplaying as gojo works. Look at her. She's making her biscuits on my leg

569
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,120
The purring too relatable

570
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,600
Does pussy run away from you unless you dress up like gojo?

571
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,280
Is that what you mean? That's that's that's what you mean

572
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,760
The tampon gojo video. No

573
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,720
What did they like

574
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,600
Did they like turn a tampon into gojo?

575
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,320
Yeah, it's that easy if girls run away from you all you have to do

576
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,880
It's just dress up as gojo and then they'll just come running towards you

577
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,960
I cannot they'll turn right back around and sit on your lap

578
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,840
She's a gojo sim

579
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,960
You know elon musk, I love this one hasn't cook

580
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,840
Bezos, I love this one. He's not doing laundry

581
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,440
Zuckerberg

582
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,840
He's not mowing his own lawn all these guys

583
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,520
They outsource this stuff that I I do the same now

584
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:28,240
I have a guy that comes in to sleep with my wife because I don't have the time to be distracted from anything

585
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:32,320
Which isn't growing revenue. Now, doesn't that make you a cuck?

586
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,880
No, that's just good business anything which isn't making you profit

587
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,440
It's distracting you from how you level up

588
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,120
Listen to them. Yeah

589
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:51,120
I bet elon musk hires someone to to have sex with his wife too for him. Does he even have a wife?

590
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,480
Sigma out of 10. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. If you want to get on yeah, if you want to get on that alpha grind

591
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,200
If you want to start, you know a drop shipping company

592
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:10,960
If you want to if you want to get your stonks up all you have to do is just start outsourcing

593
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,880
You know all the all the extra stuff in your life that don't matter

594
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,760
like your wife

595
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:27,040
Yeah, that's that's the best business advice you're welcome. You came here for memes, but you're really leaving with great life advice

596
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,960
Okay

597
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:36,400
This is just part this is just part noises

598
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,520
My freaking chair keeps creaking and it sounds like I'm farting

599
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,720
Zero to ten

600
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,960
Look at it pulsating. Oh my god

601
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,920
Like it's jiggling

602
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,960
That's literally how I sound like

603
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,080
Amy this morning

604
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,280
No

605
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Oh my god

606
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,320
Why does that kind of look yummy too? It looks like nice and crispy and like

607
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,200
I don't know it looks edible

608
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,680
Yeah, like s'mores it looks like s'mores kind of hot right

609
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,640
Listen if the sound was it coming out of this random ass cup, maybe it would be a little hot

610
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,360
Maybe it would be a little hot. Yeah, hear hear me out. Hear me out

611
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,160
No

612
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,600
I should you know how I tweeted out if um

613
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,680
If I should uh

614
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,200
Would you guys be weird out if I queefed into the mic?

615
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,200
I'm gonna do that one day

616
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,200
He had a thin face

617
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,720
boldest eyes

618
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,720
His hair was short and brown. I think it's all a blur. I think I got it

619
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,480
Is this the man who attacked you?

620
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,360
What is he blushing? Well, it's skin pigment

621
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,560
Why are his eyes red? That's his charon gone

622
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,560
Okay, the only reason I put this one is because

623
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,200
In my old sketchbook. I literally used to draw stuff like this and I thought it was really funny

624
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:49,280
Like literally this is this is probably like almost an exact exact replica of my middle school drawings

625
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,720
Three out of ten

626
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:58,400
It's his charon gone. I don't think they drew the charon gone correctly. That's not how it looks like, right?

627
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,680
I've heard more people pee on twitter in the last few days than the rest of my life combined. I'm just here for the right

628
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,360
I don't gotta do it. I just think it's funny

629
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,000
Hey, it's funny. I think it's funny to pee too, but I felt like

630
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,280
I feel like

631
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,720
No, I want to hold it back and when I wanted to be a prize

632
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,520
You're so skinny the zoomer stuff is actually killing me

633
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,040
It's funny. Not even not even all of this is

634
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,200
You're asking too many fucking questions

635
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,600
What are you the police?

636
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,240
What are you the fucking police get out of my asshole?

637
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,600
Yeah, I have a screenshot of your parents home address. What am I supposed to not?

638
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:50,400
I'm supposed to not know everything about you dude. I was supposed to not google your fucking grandma's name

639
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,880
Oh found your grandfather's obituary. I did that in 20 minutes or less

640
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,440
Let me finish eating. Hold on

641
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,160
Okay, I'm officially done eating sausage rolls

642
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,320
I did find this one to be relatable

643
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,760
Right wave material

644
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,640
That's wife behavior

645
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,600
That's wife behavior right there

646
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:34,240
Mm-hmm, if she really likes you, you know if she wanted to she would and I would and I do

647
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,520
Is she eating a meal deal? What do you mean? What what cup?

648
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,520
I

649
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,040
Have a small talk more um stalking

650
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:00,560
Wish I was that sausage roll you want me to bite on you and chew you and swallow you

651
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:10,240
But the never a minute no not every girl does this not every girl not every girl only me

652
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,120
All right, what do we got?

653
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:21,600
This is just terrible what a terrible situation to be in calling

654
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,360
Okay, so we're all you guys should understand this one. Come on. Don't fold my cards. You're terrible

655
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,720
You should get this one. It's it's so bad

656
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,000
It's all the different numbers the terrible cards

657
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,320
Ah

658
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:42,560
You guys are no fun. Why'd you take your clothes off? Oh, you're playing house rules

659
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:48,160
Nope, not what that means and this is our house. Oh, so you guys take your clothes

660
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:54,480
He's getting excited again. Oh, so nobody's taking their clothes off. All right. You're going back in the trunk. I'm sorry

661
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,280
It's just you keep doing it

662
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,120
I I didn't watch this whole thing so when he got excited again

663
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,680
Terrible cards

664
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,680
in house rules

665
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,480
Oh, I thought we were playing house rules. Nope. Not what that means and this is our house

666
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,520
Oh, so you guys take your clothes. Oh, so you're gonna take your clothes off

667
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,280
Okay

668
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:27,040
It looks like people understand that's good. That's good. That's good. If you don't understand when rats get happy their eyes pop out like that

692
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,240
What's crazy is I literally okay

693
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,480
Obviously I find this cringe. This is hella cringe, but I literally read books like this

00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,320
With the cringe ass neat chosen by the alpha. This is the shit I read

695
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,880
I could probably go in my uh in my um

00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,560
Bookshelf and probably find some cringe name like that

697
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,920
I'm not even gonna lie

698
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,080
This is terrible though. I hate that. I hate that video

699

Okay, I'll show the original to the ones who haven't seen it. So basically

01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,000
There is a video of I guess an oni-chan

712
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,960
A competition at an anime event

713
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:45,680
And it's it's pretty cringe. I'm not gonna lie. Is this it?

714
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,320
Oh god. Oh, fuck

715
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,440

716
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,160
Okay, she's cute she did it well she was confident

717
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,080
Oni-chan

718
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,840
Oh my god

719
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,680
Competition's over. She won

720
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,440

723
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,360
Oh, he didn't get his he didn't get enough hype

724

725
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,360
This hurts. I know

726
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,360
And I know I know it's I'm I'm literally birding myself here

727
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,160
By showing you that and laughing and saying it's cringe

728
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,200
It's okay. I'm I'm cringe. It means turn

729
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:49,120
I can't I can't not after that not after that give me some time to cool off, please

730
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,880
I really figured you'd end it with your best

731
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,840
Why are we so cringe it's because it's funny it's funny

732
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,800
It means in that video

733

No, I'm not should have you'll never see me in there. No

734
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,240
This is

735
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,680
And literally moving away from you it's terrifying

736
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,920
Oh my god the art

737
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,400
This is so lame

738
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:56,320
Unironically, I think they'd work really well together. I think they would really work well together 10 out of 10. Thank you

739
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,880
It's just like pen pals and emmy

740
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,640
I'm twilight though, right? You're not making me more to Kai in this ship, right?

741
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,120
They got like the perfect clips for it too

742
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:17,280
Someone did put if it's six out of 10 the bisexual lighting right there

743
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,960
They do have the same colors

744
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,360
We

745
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,960
Have this ship even start from the drawing

746
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:34,560
They show the drawing this drawing this fuck-ass drawing. Oh my god. So terribly me

748
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,120

Ha ha ha get the damn arrow out of my head. There is no arrow in your head

761
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:12,560
Am I going schizophrenic? I keep seeing an arrow. We killed our first black person

762
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,040
We already killed your buddy though. How do you feel about that?

763
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:22,400
Black bitch shut the hell up dick who I'm going fish. Why the hell did you turn southern? You know, I'm the sexy one

01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,480
There's more stuff like this

766
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,480
There's this dude. I think his name is uh pixel something on tiktok

767
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,880
And he literally live streams as both deku and bakugou

768
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:47,280
And he like switches between the voices and he's really good at both of them

769
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,320
And they're so funny. I might have included one of his streams here. I don't know

770
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:55,120
But that was 10 out of 10. I don't care what any of you guys say that was 10 out of 10. Brilliant. Yes

771
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,520
And we cancelled no

772
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,880

777
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:28,480
I've seen a guy voice deku while playing cotton. He's so cringe in a funny way. I love it when people do his voice

778
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,200
I love it. I think it's because his voice is so bad

779
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,520
It's so like

780
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:40,320
Like, oh, uh, you know how I said I was watching I watched two year eternity the dub for that literally sounds like

Someone's gotta do it

01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:38,240
Cook cook cook cook princess

834
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:44,960
From the crystal kidding cadence cadence cadence. Yeah, princess cadence and shining

835
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,880
But what I have to punish you I just think the audio is funny

836
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:55,040
Because because you bit me because you bit me. Yeah. Yeah, why'd you do that?

837
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,800
Bro, look, she's even meowing. Look at that jawline

838
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,480
Yeah, yeah

839
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,040
Are you hungry from your big day today?

840
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,600
Oh

841
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,120
You can see the fire in the background

842
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,160
Is she crying for her mom

843
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,920
It is not me cooking

844
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:43,600
I've never because it looks like she's just frying the tort the tortilla

845
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,720
on um

846
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:51,200
You know on the stove like platform itself. Is that something that people do?

847
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,840
No pan yeah, it looks like she's using no pan

848
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,400
So thank you

849
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,280
I feel like that's a recipe for disaster

850
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,560
Like it's literally on fire now

851
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,040
It should be illegal I guess people do it

852
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,480
It's not something that I do but some people are insane like that. Huh my grandmother does it, huh?

853
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:33,920
Yeah, so this basement apartment gets some fantastic natural lighting over there. Um, don't worry about that

854
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,960
This is the previous tenant the leaving literally sleeping in the bed

855
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,240
To show you the unit when your tenants still in the bed. It's a standard practice now

856
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:47,760
There's green tape running down the middle. Uh, so you're gonna be getting the right side of the bed and uh, yeah

857
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:54,000
That's gonna come right off. Um, this isn't a one bed. No one side of the bed. Yeah, so I'm actually moving back into the unit

858
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:59,120
I'll be sleeping on the left side. So don't worry. You're not gonna be next to anyone weird. It's just me

859
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,640
Oh, I'm john. By the way, great to meet you. Tom. Let me show you the rest of the space

860
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:10,000
Uh, so this is my mining equipment. It's mine. It's really big mining equipment. Oh my god washroom

861
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,400
You've got the standing shower

862
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:16,720
You're gonna get the right side of the shower to match the right side of the bed. So there's no confusion

863
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,680
The right side of the toilet right side of the sink and right side of the beer

864
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,640
Any other questions? Sounds fair. How much of this?

865
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:30,640
Do I have to get married plus utilities? That's a steal right now. What? Why would you?

866
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:36,240
Well, I guess you're not marrying me. What the hell? Why would you do that?

867
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,920
Is my chat like really behind? I feel like the chat's really behind

868
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:57,440
Fair deal. What the hell? Okay. I wanted to show this

869
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,240
2000 what did he say?

870
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,920
2,500 bucks. I wanted to show this because um

871
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:10,320
When I complained about my neighbors and I said I don't have AC people were like, oh wow, she must be really poor

872
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,400
She must live in a shithole

873
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,880
like

874
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,320
Surprisingly

875
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,600
It's like

876
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,320
Really like if you live in Canada like

877
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,800
It is the whole entirety of Canada is a shithole. This is this is like

878
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:31,600
This is if you've seen like the rental prices like this is literally shit people do for real

879
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,800
They will rent like half a room

880
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,680
And then there's a mattress on the floor there. Well, sorry

881
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:41,040
There's two mattresses on the floor and you have one half of the room

882
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:47,760
With you know one mattress and then your roommate lives in the same room with you with the other mattress on the floor

883
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:53,840
Like Canadian prices are legitimately like that like I got I got lucky

884
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,160
Like I don't I don't I don't live in a shithole

885
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,240
Like I live pretty

886
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:09,600
Compared to like what a lot of Canadian places look like today. I feel like I'm okay. I'm doing okay

887
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,680
So, yeah, you're lying. What what do you mean I'm lying? No

888
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,720
I mean, I don't know if it's legal, but I've seen like

889
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,000
A lot of people just rent out their basement

890
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:30,560
And they'll be like, oh, please enter through the garage door. Um, no guests. No music. No smoking. No pets

891
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,280
um

892
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,960
I don't know

893
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:42,080
400 square feet kitchen is shared bathroom is shared, you know with the with the rest of us. Um

894
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,360
You're only allowed to enter the kitchen from the times of

895
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,240
8 a.m. To 3 p.m

896
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,880
You're only allowed to shower

897
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,920
From, you know, 8 p.m. To 10 p.m.

898
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:01,280
And then the price will be like three thousand dollars a month. Like that's how bad it is

899
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,000
Mercy's basement is probably kinder. Yeah

900
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:14,320
Anyways, next meme oh this one's cute

901
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,880
Oh

902
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,720
Yeah, at least mercy's rent free even if you're tied up and stuff, you know

903
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,440
The poor little dog. He looks so old

904
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:40,800
He was so happy to just sit on the bed with his freaking owner. He just falls really slowly

905
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,760
I hired these two women to cut my grass because I'm all about like supporting women

906
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:51,280
But they've been working on it for like a week and they're not even halfway finished

907
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,720
Can someone give me an answer on why it's taking so long?

908
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:02,720
Oh, they're so cute halfway finished. Can someone give me an answer? They're naked. Oh, they're so ugly too

909
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:13,600
Move to southeast asia. Is that what it that sees look at the exact same accommodations for a tenth of the price

910
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,600
Oh, I know I know

911
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,440
I'm well aware

912
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,560
It's very much a Canadian thing. The rest of the world is not that bad

913
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,440
So, yeah, um, I love skinny pigs

914
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,560
They're so ugly

915
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,680
But they're also really cute at the same time

916
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,160
Shaved they're not shaved they're born like that

917
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:41,120
But yeah, fuck these ladies taking her money and not cutting her grass

918
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:46,800
How dare they look at them slacking off. I thought it was a dog. It looks like a tiny pig

919
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,600
Oh my god

920
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,400
Yeah, you know in my free time I like to watch this is anime

921
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:58,080
This is cool. I just love watching anime. You know, I'm actually 116 Japanese

922
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:05,360
Oh slice of life shows like the the writing's actually really good and like the drama and everything is

923
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,080
I don't really like to talk to people in the real world

924
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:11,280
Watching them talk to each other and anime is really entertaining

925
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,280
On the episode where they had to go to math class math class fire

926
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:19,680
Yeah, I'm gonna just watch like in my free time like I'll watch like one or two episodes a day

927
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:25,280
Or like, you know every couple days all I fucking do is watch anime. You need to take a shower

928
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,240
How can I watch in the shower? How am I supposed to read subtitles in the shower baka?

929
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:36,240
I don't need to eat. I don't need to bathe. I don't need to brush my teeth. I like how I lose this anime

930
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:40,320
Yeah, this one show I watched it's about all these kids are like fall in high school

931
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,800
They have these superpowers though and then in the show they

932
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,640
Like I'm younger as young as possible

933
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,800
Is he wearing two wigs probably it kind of looks like that, huh?

934
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:12,800
I like this guy he's so funny. I like him young as young as possible. Oh, this is just a big

935
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,640
This is just a video for

936
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,800
10 out of 10 it was very relatable

937
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,760
This is just literally no thoughts in that head

938
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,960
Me shlorp and now in that dick

939
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,880
It's so cute

940
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:42,080
The freaking bulgy eyes gets me every time

941
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:50,000
You guys don't know but when I was going through my tiktok likes to like download stuff for this stream

942
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,600
Literally every other

943
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,080
Video was just a rat

944
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:02,080
Doing something rat content and I had to filter through all of those because I was like I can't just have a full stream of

945
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,080
just rat stuff

946
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:11,520
Do my eyes bulge when I sleep if I'm happy enough. Yes, the bulge just like that. Isn't that so sexy?

947
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,640
That's what you see when you wake up that's how I'm gonna wake you up

948
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,960
Oh my god, that's so ugly what happens to a child who isn't loved properly

949
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,040
I

950
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,560
Don't play Genshin, but I think the people who do will enjoy that one

951
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:45,360
You imagine that as fan art if anyone draws here, I would love to see that

952
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:51,120
You feel called out good. You should what are you doing wasting your life with Genshin?

953
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:54,320
Bro, I should stop stop stop stop

954
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,400
Okay

955
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,040
I don't know how many Canadians are watching

956
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,880
But this is this is how Canadian geese act

957
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,080
like

958
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:15,120
Play honkai instead. No, don't play any of them

959
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,320
They're all the same

960
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,880
This is how Canadian geese act

961
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:27,520
You say what did you say that goose will be dinner? You say that but you've never met you've never met a goose. You really haven't

962
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,720
They are so

963
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,720
They're so mean

964
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,440
They genuinely act like this

965
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:46,080
I'd rather play with in me. Yeah, don't play Genshin or honkai play with me

966
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:53,120
Um, but yeah, I have I used to have a bunch at my school campus and like

967
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:59,360
They were ruthless. You do not get close to those guys. They will chase you. They will chase you

968
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,600
I've literally seen videos

969
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:04,480
from people that go to my school where they

970
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:10,400
They like film each other getting chased by geese on campus. It's actually really funny

971
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,640
Oh my god, mom you're gonna love this one

972
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,440
What the hell? I don't know who that is

973
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
No, read it. Oh

974
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,480

975
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,800
Who is this guy? Has he been texting you?

976
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,960
He's even texting you. It's a minion. That's just from a movie. Oh, yeah

977
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,920
Just read what it says though. Facebook. No

978
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:37,920
Log in read what the image says under the minion read it X exercise

979
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,240
Yeah

980
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:45,200
No, keep going. I just don't understand. I don't know who he's texting me. I'm not getting any of these messages

981
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:50,160
Because I'm not showing you any text messages. What are you saying? You can tell he's trying not to laugh too

982
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:58,080
You know what never never mind extra fries. Do you get it? Because exercise is not an extra prize

983
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,040
I know but I just don't know who this is

984
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:08,080
This is what moms are like for sure every time i'm on my phone around her

985
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:12,480
She's like, who are you texting? Who are you talking to? Are you texting xyz?

986
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,160
All right, am I a minion? No, do I look like a minion to you?

987
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,160
Amy's showing us her memes you guys rating my memes a zero out of 10

01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:44,720
They would not know that you were from the united states. No, they probably think I was japanese

993
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:49,760
I actually speak with a dialect like an accent from the southern part of japan where I grew up. What? That's cool

994
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:55,200
What does a southern japanese accent sound like corn knee itchy off watashi no namai with josh death

995
01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:02,320
This is what strutty would probably sound like speaking japanese. Go cheese osama. There's no way that's japanese. Like what the f

996
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,960
Knee horn go galley with terry meska

997
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,920
That's probably what she sounds like

998
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:14,240
I am way cuter than a minion. I'm not a minion

999
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,880
10 out of 10 eat the ducky mouse

1000
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,240
Eat the ducky mouse

1001
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,760
Gary Buster Holmes was that?

1002
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,880
Will terry noscar

1003
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:38,400
Yeah, like he literally sounds like a native southern japanese speaker for sure

1004
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:43,120
Oh, hey yo gozai masu

1005
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:47,600
If an alien abducted me, okay, I relate to this so hard

1006
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:53,360
I love this because this lady like put into words exactly how I feel about alien abductions

1007
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,760
If an alien abducted me

1008
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:59,280
Took time out of his day his or her day

1009
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,240
To beat me up into a spaceship

1010
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,120
Just me not anybody else in neighborhood

1011
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:12,240
I would make love to them back because that means I was chosen special

1012
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:18,720
They didn't just beam up sally next door. No, they chose me because she was out in her yard working

1013
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:23,920
They'd be me up out of my own bed as I'm relaxing playing candy crush. Yeah

1014
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:31,920
So if they took the time to specifically pick me out of all these other humans that are around me

1015
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,880
Yes, I'll make love

1016
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,280
Unlike these people on tinder

1017
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,320
Who the only thing they want to do

1018
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,000
Is scam me and catfish me and extort money from me

1019
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:54,160
You never know an alien my all these all these women only want your money. Just go fuck an alien. I fall in love with an alien

1020
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,480
And I'm not opposed to that

1021
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,320
I'm not opposed to it either

1022
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I don't want to get pegged by et

1023
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:12,160
Well, if et loves me enough, I might just let him peg me

1024
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,000
Man, we're trying to dissect you. Why are you crying?

1025
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:25,520
Why are you guys saying bogos binted now you're being the zoomer

1026
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,680
I

1027
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,920
Don't I feel like yeah et got that long finger. I feel like

1028
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,960
I feel like aliens could get really freaky

1029
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,760
especially if

1030
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
An alien chose me like

1031
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:48,800
I don't know like he chose me specifically like he chose to to be me. He chose to bogos binted me

1032
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,680
Like uh, I'll get freaky with you if you choose me

1033
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:02,240
My standard is a little okay. The exam begins now. Good morning. Yes. I'm fine. Um,

1034
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:07,760
Do you have any pets? Yes, I have a dog called freddy. Do you like dogs?

1035
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:12,960
This is the crying face. He looks like he's gonna cry. I do not have a cat

1036
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,600
But I do

1037
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,600
Have a horse

1038
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,880
His name is molly

1039
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,040
Sometimes

1040
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:30,400
She has 46 days. Where do you live?

1041
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,360
Perhaps perhaps I live

1042
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,400
in a flat

1043
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,560
With my sister

1044
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,720
And I also have a mum. What are your hobbies?

1045
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:51,760
My freaking eye twitch food is burgers, but I do not like the color blue. Why don't you like the color blue?

1046
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,120
It is bad

1047
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,760
because it is

1048
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:06,800
Although I eat water

1049
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,840
I would like

1050
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:14,560
Cheese, okay. Thank you. The test is over. Goodbye. Hello

1051
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,080
Okay

1052
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,400
So

1053
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:26,320
I don't relate to this because I've never had like french speaking exams

1054
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:30,000
but I relate to this because I took um

1055
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:37,520
I took eight months of japanese class at school and this is exactly how my speaking exams went

1056
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:43,120
They were all we had a bunch of interviews with the teacher and she would ask us questions like this and I swear to god

1057
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:45,120
This is how I was answering

1058
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:50,240
I have a horse named molly

1059
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,480
This is me and my Spanish exams right

1060
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:59,520
They're they also always talk so quickly to you in the exams

1061
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:05,760
Okay, I'm gonna go um, I'm gonna go pee real quick. I'll come right back

1062
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,680
I also weigh my face because I'm really sweaty right now

1063
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,840
But I will be back in a couple of

1064
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,600
Minutes

1065
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,560
Oh no

1066
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,960
Oh no momentum

1067
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,000
How far are we in the videos? I don't know. I'll be right back

1068
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,120
You

1069
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:17,120
You

1070
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,120
You

1071
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,120
You

1072
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,120
You

1073
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,120
You

1074
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:47,120
You

1075
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,360
You

1076
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,080
Why are you guys spamming waterfalls?

1077
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:31,440
I didn't fall to the second. I'm gone for like more than two minutes. You guys are like she fell into the toilet. She's dead

1078
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:37,920
I did not bring any eminid. No, I flushed all my eminid down the toilet

1079
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:45,520
Were you fried chicken or that shut up? I was muted. You didn't hear anything. You did not hear anything

1080
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Always did she bring the mic with her?

1081
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,200
She got a shard again

1082
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:59,360
I secretly sharded my pants and I just didn't tell you guys and I had to go clean up real quick

1083
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:02,560
It happened again

1084
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,640
Who cuts people's air in the middle of the night? I do they call me the midnight barber

1085
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:11,760
Yeah, well that's an infringement of people's liberties. Is it yeah, so don't ever be doing that to me. I do do it to you

1086
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,800
What who do you think cuts your hair?

1087
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:19,040
Einstein my air just doesn't grow very fast. What do you think it stays that length naturally?

1088
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:23,680
I'm in there in the night styling away. How dare you do that to me in the night when I'm oblivious

1089
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:25,760
I'll see my best work when you're oblivious

1090
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,480
I just thought that was really cute

1091
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:35,840
Because my dog also hates getting her nails cut so I thought this was a good idea too the midnight barber

1092
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,120
I

1093
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:45,360
Just imagine the potential for a wave of blue doughnos. What do you mean a wave of blue doughnos?

1094
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:49,360
Ten ten. Thank you. Not as cute as Amy

1095
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:53,120
Thank you for that too

1096
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:56,560
It's still really cute though the midnight barber

1097
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,600
Burp too quiet

1098
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:05,520
I don't know some people hate burps and some people love them. So I try not to burp too much

1099
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,280
My

1100
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:12,160
She would raise you if you know

1101
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,800
Should I sing along with him?

1102
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,800
Well, I'm a battle

1103
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:26,800
If she ever does mock me, I'm gonna tell the world she queefs. So she better not mock me

1104
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:33,600
I've been trying to keep my new streak. We've got matters. You heard him say it

1105
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:39,200
She was the one who taught me the good. She said I'll teach you how to edge soon

1106
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:44,640
We were in Ohio when I first moved. She said better. I'm proud of you

1107
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,400
I'm a full sigma and she knows it

1108
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,520
You can be signature if you

1109
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,040
Edge

1110
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,360
I'm so bad at singing

1111
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,880
Edge Max

1112
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,840
Take me to

1113
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:10,640
And keep me awake so you don't get mocked every night drops give it e-raise and I

1114
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:17,520
Ask if she watches aiden ross if she don't then you can tell her goodbye

1115
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,920
I was so bad at keeping up with the

1116
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:28,240
Sam Smith if he was good really really

1117
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,840
You're hilarious

1118
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:39,840
I almost want to try again to see if I can do it better, but I feel like it's too cringe

1119
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:47,040
Why am I here just to suffer? Yeah, you're here for me to to torture you with my zoomer tiktoks

1120
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,520
You didn't have enough for this. I know I know

1121
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:56,080
He did it way better. He had so much worse than me. This guy's singing isn't bad. Isn't bad. It's beautiful

1122
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,360
Hello my microphone just randomly disconnected there. Uh

1123
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,800
That's weird

1124
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,040
It was beautiful

1125
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,760
I'm good now. I'm good now

1126
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,880
At least I think I'm good now

1127
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,480
Testing testing. I did not shart. I didn't mute to shart

1128
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,080
God had to mute

1129
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,960
He was done with my fucking singing

1130
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:33,360
I'm gonna show what it's supposed to look like

1131
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,680
It's so cute too

1132
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,480
It's a little phallic shaped

1133
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,400
It's a sock

1134
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:04,400
It looks like the inside out sock. Wait, I don't know what you're talking about. What if he sees in the toilet?

1135
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:13,920
I feel like this is what I would make if I ever tried to crochet it's a yellow tear

1136
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:21,920
They really I mean if for a first time it I feel like it's pretty good. It's the banana cards

1137
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:27,360
It's got it's got more personality to it, you know

1138
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:33,040
Okay, show me your little treasure trove. Why is it so cute?

1139
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:45,840
She made like zombie noises and made the freaking unicorn on top eat. This is this is a

1140
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:51,760
This is a little girl with a box full of cicada shells. I think it's cicada shells

1141
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,320
Sierra out of 10

1142
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,960
Are you talking about this or the

1143
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:01,440
The bee this is a 10 out of 10. Look how cute she's even got her bracelets in there

1144
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:06,560
She's got both both of her bracelets and her cicada shells

1145
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,440
Like what a cutie patootie

1146
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,280
Oh my god, there's an ant on my desk

1147
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:19,360
This is 10 out of 10. Yeah

1148
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:23,440
Okay, show me your little treasure. She's got personality. She's gonna go far in life

1149
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:26,240
I

1150
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:30,080
Can't get over how she like makes the unicorn chew on the show

1151
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,520
I love the mexican people, especially the big girls

1152
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:39,440
Las gorditas. They are so tasty. Ike Rico. They call me el viejo ascaroso

1153
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:47,360
Which is Spanish for the handsome orange man. In fact, the next big beautiful, uh, when I see I'll be grabbing her by the taco

1154
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,320
Las gorditas

1155
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:55,920
Thank you dirty test confirmed. No, I just have an ant problem

1156
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:04,080
I'm sure it'll go away soon. I use like ant traps, but I can't tell if it's working or not

1157
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:08,080
Las gorditas, maybe my rats will just eat all the ants

1158
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:15,440
I love the mexican people, especially the big girls las gorditas

1159
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:21,200
They're so tasty. Ike Rico. Ike Rico. It's an AI voice. I'm pretty sure but it's so funny

1160
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:26,720
There's a dirty tip to find the best stuff when you find a really cute item like this vintage top

1161
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:29,120
Make sure there's not poop on

1162
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:31,680
Make sure nobody pooped on

1163
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:34,080
the item

1164
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:37,200
That's it. Just make sure there's no poop

1165
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:41,760
What a great what a great thrifting tip

1166
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:45,520
I would have never I would have never guessed to do that

1167
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:50,320
I could have probably accidentally bought something with poop on it

1168
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,480
10 out of 10 tips. Any other dead stuff?

1169
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:03,040
Find the best stuff when you find a really cute item like this vintage top make sure there's not poop on it

1170
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,800
Make sure nobody pooped on the item

1171
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:10,640
How did they even get poop so high up on the shirt?

1172
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:13,920
Like when you poop you poop your pants, not your shirt

1173
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:16,640
poop stream

1174
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,440
I would I don't watch coco melon you need to try harder if you want to torture me

1175
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:29,040
I would gladly watch coco melon with my little sister. I don't watch coco melon

1176
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,560
I watched my little pony though. That's not torture

1177
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,560
It defies gravity. Oh, maybe it was tucked in you're right

1178
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,440
Explosive

1179
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,600
Oh, this one's funny

1180
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:02,960
I didn't see it coming. I didn't see it coming at all. You don't get it

1181
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:11,200
You all are getting the color of your man's tipped paint on your nail

1182
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:20,560
I didn't get it at first. I was like, why why are her nails white and sparkly? I don't get it and then she shut her man

1183
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,400
10 out of 10, thank you

1184
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,400
Yeah, you got that his even his tip is sparkly

1185
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:36,240
I've never genuinely I've never watched Twilight genuinely

1186
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:44,480
If I were to choose a team, I'd probably choose team edward just because I like vampires more than werewolves, but yeah

1187
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:47,920
He's got that pale sparkly head

1188
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:56,160
Watch along do you guys want to watch along of dwilight? Are you guys interested in watching dwilight?

1189
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:58,160
Wait

1190
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:11,440
Doesn't he know what she's saying

1191
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:17,520
No, you don't want to watch twilight. Okay. Okay. Okay. We won't watch twilight. We won't watch twilight

1192
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:24,080
No, I won't make you do that

1193
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,560
I

1194
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:32,880
Love the nose going up and down is so funny so aggressive

1195
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:38,240
I love aggressive little cute things. I'm an aggressive little cute thing

1196
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:47,760
What does anyone know what is a Russian doesn't even know what she's saying

1197
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:54,560
I need you guys to see in here

1198
01:45:57,120 --> 01:46:04,480
10 out of 10 9.9. Why are you so suspicious specific about it? You know the nose or the eye

1199
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:16,160
Context to this okay context to this so this is this is some random lady on tiktok that I follow

1200
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:21,520
I followed her because I genuinely thought her singing was good

1201
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:27,040
And I think that probably gives you an idea of how like bad I am at singing

1202
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:30,320
Because I genuinely think this woman is good at singing like I think

1203
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:33,360
Like I can tell the song cover doesn't sound good

1204
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:34,880
um

1205
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:38,240
In other people's ears, but I to me it's like

1206
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:41,840
It's good to me

1207
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:44,660
You're gonna cringe. Oh, this is gonna be bad

1208
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,520
Everybody is disapproval

1209
01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:02,080
If the heavens ever did see he's the last to mouth pee

1210
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:04,480
Like she's good

1211
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:07,360
Is she not

1212
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:15,120
Do you like this song I like this song, but i'm just saying like she's she's good, right?

1213
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:17,200
Absolutely

1214
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:23,280
It's not bad

1215
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:28,000
I was born sick, but I love it

1216
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,800
Take me to church

1217
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:55,280
Oh

1218
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:09,520
She said a minute really peak

1219
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:17,920
She reminds me of Shakira with the way she sings I think this is a full song cover

1220
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:20,480
In the

1221
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:23,600
She sings like Shakira with the shaking of her voice

1222
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:32,080
It makes me uncomfortable just like church 10 out of 10 perfect. Yeah, she's pleading like a

1223
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:35,760
It's not in rhythm

1224
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,480
That's a problem. I think it sounds good like

1225
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:44,000
Shakira mugged. Yeah, Shakira who I only know this lady

1226
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:47,520
She has talent keeping

1227
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:54,560
Oh, this is so cute. This is genuinely so cute

1228
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:04,240
Oh, man, this like makes me cry

1229
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:11,600
Because it's so cute. Some of you probably think it's really disgusting and gross and dirty, but the bull

1230
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:14,560
Oh

1231
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:21,360
Like it's so wholesome I can't handle it

1232
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:32,160
It's probably in New York City, you would see this crazy shit in New York like the bull 10 out of 10. Yes. Thank you

1233
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:35,120
I'm your rat

1234
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:41,440
I feel kind of offended when people call me a rat because rats are like ugly to a lot of people

1235
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
But this is a cute rat

1236
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,720
I want to kiss it. I want to kiss it. Look at this distinguished gentleman

1237
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:53,680
Look at the way he is sitting. Yes

1238
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,680
Rats have ginormous balls

1239
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:04,400
That's why I didn't want to get male rats because I didn't want their balls like running across my face

1240
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,560
While I'm sleeping and stuff

1241
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:09,040
Look at this distinguished gentleman

1242
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:12,480
Look at the way he is sitting. Yes, very

1243
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:24,080
No, he wasn't eating the rat from the other video

1244
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:31,680
No, I didn't want their balls dragging across my face

1245
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:34,480
Is that too much to ask?

1246
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:44,640
Okay, this is funny because when I okay, so if you don't know

1247
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:48,960
Um on tiktok, there's these like, um

1248
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:52,640
What's it called?

1249
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:57,120
There's like these fortune teller women that will randomly appear on your for you page and they'll be like

1250
01:50:57,440 --> 01:51:04,800
This video has no hashtags. It was meant to find you and then they'll do like some tarot card pulls to like, I don't know

1251
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:12,240
Tell you your future or tell you like you're going to meet the love of your life in

1252
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:17,200
Five days something like that, right? So this is I got this

1253
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:23,760
I got this specific tiktok like right before we were gonna debut. So I thought it was really funny

1254
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:27,200
Your partner wants to drink your squirt this weekend

1255
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:30,320
Yep

1256
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:34,480
Yeah, you heard me on that one. Um, they have been thinking about this all week

1257
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:41,360
And they're ready for that rain splash, right? Uh, a little bit of a cancer on this one and I am getting a capricorn

1258
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,040
Whatever

1259
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:49,120
Anyway, yeah, your partner has been basically so he knew backwards because we have this obama snow here, right?

1260
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:54,800
We're talking about this double edge. He was not wrong. I understand that this might be the means to be drinking that squirt

1261
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:59,520
Yeah, right, maybe that's gonna have like a three to four hours session where they do that, right?

1262
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:02,160
Where we're doing a little bit of a double edge. It's kind of goes both ways

1263
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:08,320
Which is stunning and then of course lastly, I did get the uh beautiful card here that does have a mega drain

1264
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:11,040
so, yeah, there's

1265
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:17,520
I will say uh hydrate maybe get some liquid ivy or something like that because I will say that this is going to be buckets in buckets of

1266
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:23,760
Squirt and I'm gonna resonate all over the place. There's gonna be resonation everywhere and I'm wishing nothing but the best for you guys

1267
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:25,760
This is this is

1268
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:28,800
It was meant to find me. I don't know what these are

1269
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:32,560
I don't know what these numbers are on the screen. They're not hentai codes. Are they?

1270
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:40,640
10 out of 10 bakey

1271
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:43,840
True in real

1272
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,640
There's no such thing. Yeah, there's a stuff like this. There's no such thing as a coincidence

1273
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:53,920
This video was meant to find you your partner wants to drink your squirt this week

1274
01:52:55,840 --> 01:53:03,200
It can't be hentai. Okay. I don't know what these numbers are. Maybe they're could they be the numbers to the these cards do do pokemon cards have

1275
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
numbers

1276
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:08,480
Oh, they're fake lucky numbers. Is that what they are?

1277
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:18,160
What are hentai codes? Uh-oh, you're a little bit too innocent to be here. If you don't know that

1278
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:24,400
How many buckets he just said buckets of end buckets I think

1279
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:28,400
Can we can we drink my squirt?

1280
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,920
Gladly

1281
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:37,920
Oh, this is the fucking guy. Oh, I love this video so much. Okay, you're not fucking ready

1282
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,800
I want us to be together forever

1283
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:44,480
How are we gonna do that?

1284
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:54,640
Oh god, john. God, john. Thank you. Thank you. I can feel you inside of me. Me too, thank you

1285
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:58,320
It feels amazing

1286
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:01,280
Amazing

1287
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:03,280
And you layer those two boys

1288
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Gotcha

1289
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:13,520
I've literally been roleplaying like this alone ever since I found this freaking dude. I'll just be alone talking to myself and I'll be like

1290
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,320
catch

1291
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:22,640
Oh god, I'm so I'm so sorry

1292
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:30,080
Yes

1293
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:33,280
This is what this is what my sly face is where it's gonna be like

1294
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:40,080
I may have gotten it stuck in the hair. There it is again. Daku. I told you to not aim for my hair

1295
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:44,800
I'm sorry. Gotcha. I was just I was so caught up in the moment

1296
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:49,520
Oh, this stuff is never gonna wash out

1297
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:53,760
You know, kachan, they actually say it's good for your hair and might make it grow longer

1298
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:57,120
Shut up. Daku. That's just a myth

1299
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:02,640
If people see this in my hair, they're gonna know something's up between us. Oh, yeah, you're right

1300
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,320
Come on. Help me clean it up. Okay

1301
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:15,120
If I hear kachan whispering into ASMR mic, I'll invert you'll invert, huh?

1302
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:19,600
Wait

1303
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:23,680
I forgot to make my mic mono. Hopefully nothing

1304
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:26,640
Was fucking up, um

1305
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:32,480
The chat's there from made a mistake with the hair. I'm guessing he got slime in his hair probably

1306
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,440
Damn Deku you got it all in my hair

1307
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:48,480
I don't know if you relate to this but I've done this now. Okay

1308
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:52,720
I didn't stream my pussy, but I did

1309
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:57,360
At one point I used my phone camera to look at it

1310
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:03,680
And I didn't realize that for some reason it had gone to the instagram camera

1311
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:08,400
Like you know how I'm pretty sure instagram has like a built-in camera

1312
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:11,120
It went to that

1313
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:15,280
And I didn't realize that and then I when I did realize that I was like, holy shit

1314
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,520
or maybe

1315
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:21,680
No, I think what happened was I was I wanted to take a picture of my kuchi to like look at it

1316
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:25,760
And and I didn't realize that I used the instagram camera

1317
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:30,160
So I took a picture of it and then when I looked back on my phone. I was like, wait, what's this overlay?

1318
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:34,560
What happened? I took a picture with the instagram camera. I never posted it disgusting where

1319
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:41,040
That's disgusting. What what is this instagram account called? Where can I find this?

1320
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:43,840
So I can make sure to to avoid it

1321
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:48,320
No, I didn't post it. I did not post it

1322
01:56:49,120 --> 01:56:51,120
This one's what he did

1323
01:56:57,680 --> 01:57:00,720
Is this from the new planet of the apes is that what it's called?

1324
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:05,200
Proof or it didn't happen shut up

1325
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:10,400
Is this from that new movie because I see a lot of these

1326
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:15,360
Yeah, I love this meme format too. I see a lot of this format when there's no sweets in the back of the

1327
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:19,920
Just some I like I was British brick brick top naked bloke

1328
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:24,640
Looks like it don't donation

1329
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:29,040
For $100,000. I'll show my pussy

1330
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:35,360
I remember I remember when I lost my mind

1331
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,360
I

1332
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:51,360
Don't take that seriously. I won't actually do that. Don't do that. Don't don't take that seriously

1333
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:00,960
It looks like 11 from stranger things

1334
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:03,440
Ah

1335
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:07,040
It's such a sexy song too

1336
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:14,080
And they were like, let me do this. This is perfect. This is so fitting for this sexy asshole

1337
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:21,520
Chat makes a yeah, if he makes a joke chat makes a promise you really want that that picture, huh?

1338
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:23,520
So

1339
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:33,440
We did the drawing challenge and then we decided to draw this dog. This is mine

1340
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:35,680
Cute cute

1341
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:51,920
Oh my god, you guys are really taking me seriously with the with the the kuchi picture

1342
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:59,680
I see that next to my bed. Yeah, that's literally your sleeper. That's like a sleeper

1343
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:02,080
Assistant

1344
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:08,640
I don't understand. Why did she give it like human nostrils and a human mouth?

1345
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:15,600
She should hang that picture on the wall. No, it's gonna stare at her while she sleeps

1346
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:18,960
It's gonna come out of the picture and like freaking

1347
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:22,160
Sleep paralysis demon her

1348
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:36,960
The next meme wait, that's all the memes. Oh, never mind. There is no next meme. That's all the memes

1349
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:46,480
You might go mute it again, I think it's because I I think it's because I

1350
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:51,920
No, I might go mute it again. I think it's because I keep accidentally kicking the wire

1351
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:58,320
And also my chat broke again

1352
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:01,680
I

1353
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,560
Talks check

1354
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:17,280
You need more memes, I'm glad you guys like the brain rot memes. They were really brain rot. I know especially the deku stuff

1355
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:21,040
I just I just think the deku stuff is funny

1356
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:23,840
kachan

1357
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,680
Thank you for liking my memes kachan. I really appreciate it

1358
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:32,400
So

1359
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:36,720
Maybe maybe we could do this again kachan shut up baka

1360
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:40,880
Damn idiot

1361
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:43,120
Okay, I'm actually starting to cringe at myself now

1362
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:46,080
Dekeli is the one next time

1363
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:51,200
I can't do ear licking. So I'll just torture you torture you with dekeli is the one

1364
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:57,600
I had the dekeli voice

1365
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:06,400
Don't worry. Don't worry kachan. I don't know how to I feel like if I try too hard, I can't do it

1366
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:10,720
I'm sorry kachan. I won't get it in your hair again. I'm sorry

1367
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:17,200
We need to wear galvanized square steels. That's true. I had it in the thumbnail here

1368
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:20,240
We can we can watch one galvanized square steel video

1369
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:23,120
Oh

1370
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Let me find one

1371
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:43,520
I don't know if these are like the actual video or is this some kind of video essay

1372
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:46,160
Sometimes I need to paraphrase

1373
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:50,080
It's easy to make your work clear. Sorry. You're just listening to an ad with me

1374
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:56,480
The galvanized steel and eco-friendly would be near me. Oh, shut up. Don't explain the meme to me. I want to see the meme

1375
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:05,520
Okay, I found one

1376
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:08,080
No, that's not a right thing

1377
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:12,560
Uh this one

1378
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:15,920
Damn baka

1379
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:19,280
Okay, oh shit

1380
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:22,240
Do

1381
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:28,640
You like the way I flick my tongue or not or not

1382
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:35,040
You can ride you can ride my face until you drip and come the new one square meter room in new york

1383
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:37,280
Little john worked hard for 10 years

1384
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:41,280
Saved up two million dollars to buy a house, but it was barely bigger than a square meter

1385
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:44,640
Even his little cat couldn't fit inside his little cat for the cheapest hammock

1386
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:47,760
Ultimately, he couldn't handle the cramped space and had to renovate it

1387
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:52,480
He starts by removing the original windows and replaces them with a galvanized square steel frame

1388
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:55,760
Yeah, forced with horizontal and vertical wells for extra strength

1389
02:02:55,840 --> 02:03:00,160
He spends his last bit of pocket money on expansion screws to securely attach it to the wall

1390
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:05,600
A top mounted pull down storage cabinet is installed nearly nearly as much as galvanized

1391
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:07,920
What's galvanized even mean?

1392
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:13,280
All covered with environmentally friendly solid wood boards for durability on top of the wooden boards

1393
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:16,080
He places a folder he's really living on the edge here

1394
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:21,040
Big enough for him and his girlfriend to sleep on together. It's also easy to put away when not needed

1395
02:03:21,120 --> 02:03:23,120
He installs window guard. Oh, there we go

1396
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:27,920
Lifting the cover reveals additional storage space for things like suitcases

1397
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:32,960
Well, he's really smart with his with his galvanized square steel. No, not the toilet!

1398
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:39,440
Not the fucking toilet, ew. Okay, back to just chatting

1399
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:41,840
Oh

1400
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:50,000
It's coating on the steel a very thin layer of zinc. Why would I have a thin layer of zinc on me? I'm not galvanized

1401
02:03:55,680 --> 02:03:57,680
Okay, well

1402
02:03:58,160 --> 02:03:59,840
Thank you for

1403
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:02,880
Here is anyone else streaming? I should probably wait

1404
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:06,880
You can run my face until you're dripping cold

1405
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:11,200
Okay, there's sheebie and there's stroney

1406
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:16,960
Wait, I can do I can do a pull

1407
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:25,600
Can I do a pull? Do I know how to do a pull? Ew. I don't want to hear myself. Plus start a pull. I'm so smart

1408
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:28,080
Sheebie

1409
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:30,080
stroney

1410
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:34,080
Who to raid? Okay, there you go. Start pull. Ow

1411
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:36,880
Uh sheebies

1412
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:40,880
Where's my where's my body? Where's my body? Wait, what?

1413
02:04:42,160 --> 02:04:44,160
Wait, huh? Wait

1414
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:47,360
What what wait?

1415
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:53,360
Wait, um

1416
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:55,920
What happened?

1417
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:59,360
Caps

1418
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:06,720
Oh, okay, sorry about that. I mean it didn't mean to scare you. Just a little magic trick that I learned recently

1419
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:12,800
Uh, how do I look at the poor results? Okay

1420
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,680
Um

1421
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:19,840
It looks like most of you want to go with uh sheebie, so we'll go with sheebie then

1422
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:23,120
Yeah, youtube studio

1423
02:05:24,080 --> 02:05:29,200
God reading is so much shittier on youtube. I'll never stop shitting on youtube

1424
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:32,480
For their shitty streams be direct

1425
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:35,840
Sheebie, okay

1426
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:41,600
Okay, thank you for coming. I'll see you tomorrow. I think tomorrow's another ASMR stream

1427
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:50,080
Just practicing my necromancy just decapitated myself real quick to see if I would survive that

1428
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:56,000
A little test, you know, trying really hard to get you back. All right. You guys wanted an

1429
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:58,800
Oni-chan for me

1430
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:02,400
I haven't practiced that. I haven't even said it once in an audio

1431
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,160
Oh oni-chan. Oh that's cringe

1432
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:12,240
I feel like because I can't speak Japanese it sounds it sounds cringe oni oni-chan

1433
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:15,440
I'll stick to big brother. I'm sorry

1434
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:21,360
I'll stick to big brother. I feel like too much of a too much of a cringe weave if I say oni-chan

1435
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:28,080
Maybe if I'm doing like a full-on roleplay I might do it. How about that if I do a full-on like

1436
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:31,200
roleplay stream

1437
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:36,640
Then it wouldn't be as bad because it's it's like fully roleplay and I can immerse myself

1438
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:41,680
You're welcome 10 out of 10 cringe. You're welcome oni-chan

1439
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:44,480
Okay

1440
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:53,440
Um, I'll see you tomorrow with ASMR again. Uh, yeah, bye. Bye

1441
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:13,680
You
