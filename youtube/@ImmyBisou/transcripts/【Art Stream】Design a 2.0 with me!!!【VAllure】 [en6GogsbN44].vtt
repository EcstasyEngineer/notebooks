um not anywhere else yeah does it involve webbing no no um I think that's

06:01.720 --> 06:09.920
everything oh yeah one more note I know it's very very early in the game to make

06:09.920 --> 06:14.720
a 2.0 model okay and it doesn't mean that I don't like this model I think this

06:14.720 --> 06:22.280
model is really cute you know I think I'm really cute but as an artist I'm very

06:22.280 --> 06:32.680
very picky I'm super super picky so I want to customize myself more yeah

06:36.640 --> 06:42.840
sorry I'm drinking tea right now I think it's peach tea with mango peach and

06:42.840 --> 06:51.200
mango I think I hate mangoes but it's the only tea I have right now so yeah

06:51.240 --> 07:02.280
it's been 75 years since I heard your voice well we're back we are so back so

07:02.280 --> 07:05.920
and plus it's cheaper because I'm an artist so I can I can fucking make a

07:05.920 --> 07:09.400
2.0 whatever I want if I wanted to I could just make the whole thing myself

07:09.400 --> 07:15.920
but I'm lazy as fuck so I'm not going to do that right let me show you let me

07:15.920 --> 07:19.000
show you what I've got going on

07:24.080 --> 07:37.880
right I'm gonna make myself a little bit more there so here is a totally legally

07:37.880 --> 07:45.380
acquired drawing program that I totally legally acquired and here okay I

07:45.380 --> 07:50.280
traced the model art now I'm not gonna do that for the actual model I'm just

07:50.280 --> 07:55.880
doing it for the design itself when I draw the model itself it's not gonna be

07:55.880 --> 08:03.960
traced from this one I look like a fucking goblin I like why do I look

08:04.200 --> 08:13.120
like this yes it is paint tool sides paint tool side too um let me drink some

08:13.120 --> 08:25.640
actual water so um we are not gonna be bald I needed to be bald because I'm

08:25.640 --> 08:33.120
gonna change my hair so this is the naked model I'm going to keep the band-aids

08:33.120 --> 08:43.840
I'm gonna keep the wound tattoo and then I have all these elements I want to add I

08:43.840 --> 08:47.680
guess so I want to keep my band-aids I want to keep my freckles I want to keep

08:47.680 --> 08:51.520
them I think I wrote tattoo wrong I don't know I want to have some sort of

08:51.520 --> 08:57.880
choker maybe a collar wait hold on let me this thing this has been annoying me

08:57.880 --> 09:03.720
for a long time I didn't mean to do that this has been annoying me for a long

09:03.720 --> 09:12.120
time my blinking I open my blinking parameters have been too sensitive so I

09:12.120 --> 09:21.560
keep blinking at you let me make them less sensitive how do I do this maybe

09:21.840 --> 09:25.040
shit I don't know how

09:29.240 --> 09:32.880
maybe make them zero point

09:40.240 --> 09:44.280
is that more or less sensitive I don't know okay you know what I should probably

09:44.280 --> 09:48.640
not mess with that right now I should probably not mess with that right now

09:48.680 --> 09:55.000
okay anyways anyway let me continue talking um right and so here's stuff I

09:55.000 --> 10:00.800
want to incorporate so right now I'm wearing your sweater but I'm I think I

10:00.800 --> 10:07.720
want to have your shirt too I think I'll take that too and then also I want to

10:07.720 --> 10:13.080
have some sort of twin tails still I want to keep that sort of beam I want to

10:13.080 --> 10:22.160
have multiple ear piercings that's right not just one I'm not dating my cousin

10:22.160 --> 10:31.080
shut up I'm dating you I'm not gonna add a leash to the collar no I want to have a

10:31.080 --> 10:38.400
split tongue yep I want to split it in half because I think that's hot um maybe

10:38.400 --> 10:44.760
a belly button piercing I'm not really sure because I feel like I feel like it

10:44.760 --> 10:48.880
might be too much around the belly area if there's both a belly button piercing

10:48.880 --> 10:56.840
and a womb tattoo but I don't know maybe glasses maybe leg warmers and I'm still

10:56.840 --> 11:04.440
on the fence on if I want to keep my book like like this book here I'm still

11:04.440 --> 11:12.200
on the fence on if I want to keep that there I'm not sure yeah

11:15.120 --> 11:22.880
so that's that and then here is my ideas that I went on Pinterest and found so

11:22.880 --> 11:26.960
um this is this is your shirt the book is special it is special that's why I

11:26.960 --> 11:37.760
kind of feel like I should keep it you know yeah I'll still have I think I want

11:37.760 --> 11:42.960
to keep the pins on my head too I think those are cute and then I like these

11:42.960 --> 11:49.160
sort of socks here like the striped nests I like kind of the unevenness of

11:49.160 --> 11:54.520
it like different different lengths I don't have some fishnets to some sort

11:54.520 --> 12:01.720
of fishnets if you lose the book how will you resurrect us I know I know I know

12:01.720 --> 12:07.040
I'm sorry you're right maybe I'll keep it and then I really like this hairstyle I

12:07.040 --> 12:10.120
know it's AI art but listen you can't fucking go on Pinterest these days

12:10.120 --> 12:16.200
anymore and not find AI art so yeah I like these really short braids like

12:16.200 --> 12:21.000
really really short that kind of on the side are on the side of her head too I'm

12:21.000 --> 12:26.160
not sure if that makes sense and also like I'll have the same side bangs I

12:26.160 --> 12:32.400
won't have these middle bangs I want a heart tongue piercing I want a heart

12:32.400 --> 12:38.640
tongue piercing oh my god I think it's so cute I like this whole outfit I found

12:38.640 --> 12:44.480
it on I found this one on Twitter I like this piercing here I think I'm gonna

12:44.480 --> 12:53.960
flip the I think I'm gonna flip the cross upside down but I kind of like it

12:53.960 --> 13:00.200
and then I cuz I I wanted to still have the loom tattoo visible so I thought

13:00.200 --> 13:05.680
this was kind of like a good base outfit to start off with especially with

13:05.680 --> 13:11.920
the fishnets can't you have two tongue piercings I guess but I don't think that

13:11.920 --> 13:19.640
would look good I like these earrings I don't know if I'll have these ones

13:19.640 --> 13:23.240
hanging down I'm not sure I don't want it I don't want it to be too complicated

13:23.240 --> 13:30.160
but I keep ripping but we'll see don't be disappointed when Ronnie I know she's

13:30.160 --> 13:36.600
not God I know she's not God I'm I might keep the same shoes I'm thinking of

13:37.360 --> 13:45.480
keeping the same style but like dying them black I'm not sure I like I want I

13:45.480 --> 13:49.020
like the jeans skirt here but I don't like the color and I feel like it's a

13:49.020 --> 13:52.440
little bit too short and tight I might make it a little more flared out and

13:52.440 --> 14:02.680
longer and I like the two bows on the on the on the pockets I think that's

14:03.600 --> 14:09.520
so this is what I've compiled but obviously if you don't like something we

14:09.520 --> 14:19.960
can change it get some J's what's J's like are those shoes hmm I think something

14:19.960 --> 14:24.400
that some of you may not have noticed either is these are your shoes too

14:24.400 --> 14:29.320
at least I think they're your shoes let me make sure let me just make sure I'm

14:29.360 --> 14:33.520
I'm pretty sure those are your shoes too

14:37.520 --> 14:49.080
videos lore let me scroll through the lore here yeah look oh wait I can't show

14:49.080 --> 15:04.320
you I'll just I'll take a screenshot and then I'll add it to the drawing

15:04.320 --> 15:14.600
program look these are your shoes that I'm wearing I stole a lot of your clothes

15:14.880 --> 15:21.200
and now I'm gonna steal your shirt too yeah it's not big feet they're just big

15:21.200 --> 15:31.580
shoes okay they're not big feet yeah good morning good morning

15:32.720 --> 15:39.200
I'm a little skeptical about how of how all of these are gonna look together on

15:39.200 --> 15:42.560
your cute and funny body but you're very talented artists so I'm excited to see

15:42.680 --> 15:50.000
don't worry I'll make them fit I'll make them look good right so let's start

15:50.000 --> 16:01.280
with the hair now normally I wouldn't do art streams because well I just feel

16:01.280 --> 16:07.520
like people aren't really interested in watching me draw it's not really a I

16:07.520 --> 16:11.120
think I need to I'm gonna just look at myself for a reference on on what my

16:11.280 --> 16:17.600
looks like it's not really um something that even I watch a lot because I don't

16:17.600 --> 16:23.680
find it entertaining either also notice not to you know to you not notice

16:23.680 --> 16:31.160
self don't take anything I draw here as like um as like a good indication of my

16:31.160 --> 16:36.600
art skills okay don't take don't take this as like an indication of how good I

16:36.600 --> 16:43.360
am the art because I'm truly really um I'm not as bad I'm not as bad as I may

16:43.360 --> 16:52.240
look okay I'm during the stream thank you my craft cursor you don't see it in the

16:52.240 --> 16:58.440
art program do you I'm always interested oh thank you

16:59.720 --> 17:03.160
I ran out of tea

17:07.320 --> 17:14.160
I'm eating my mic too all right all right all right um what are you using to draw

17:14.160 --> 17:26.600
yes a lovely lovely viewer gifted me a freaking who we on is that how you

17:26.600 --> 17:31.720
pronounce it no wait sorry why come why come why come we come we come why come

17:31.720 --> 17:39.400
I don't know um there it's like a really popular um brand of drawing tablet and I

17:39.400 --> 17:46.960
never had one before I was really scared of getting a wake-up tablet because I've

17:46.960 --> 17:51.000
always had like such bad experience with every single tablet I've ever gone

17:51.000 --> 17:57.240
literally every single tablet I've ever purchased already had a similar literally

17:57.240 --> 18:03.080
every single tablet I've ever purchased has always come to me broken it's always

18:03.080 --> 18:06.840
been delivered to me broken so I was really worried oops I probably shouldn't

18:06.840 --> 18:13.560
that I was really worried that if I got my head is so flat where is the brain why

18:13.560 --> 18:19.840
do I have no brain here I was really worried that if I were to order a wake

18:19.840 --> 18:27.440
up tablet then um it would come to me delivered and then I would have spent all

18:27.440 --> 18:36.520
that money just to you know be annoyed so yeah did I say it would come to me

18:36.520 --> 18:41.800
delivered it would come to me broken it would be delivered to me broken and I

18:41.800 --> 18:46.680
don't want that to happen one brain cell in me I have more than one brain cell

18:46.880 --> 18:53.160
I'll prove it to you I'll prove it to you but for some reason the model artist

18:53.160 --> 19:03.240
which um that drew you know this model kind of gave me a really flat head like

19:03.240 --> 19:13.280
this this dome here that you see here is is bigger I I enlarged my brain just to

19:13.280 --> 19:19.880
make it look normal like this is bigger than what my actual head shape this is

19:19.880 --> 19:25.040
bigger than what my actual head shape was and it's kind of embarrassing through me

19:25.040 --> 19:28.080
what does that mean

19:28.480 --> 19:41.560
doctored head size no it doesn't have a screen I don't like um I actually don't

19:41.560 --> 19:48.040
like I don't think sorry I'm trying to decide if I should keep the the side

19:48.040 --> 19:52.920
bangs I feel like they look a little bit it's a little bit hard for me to draw

19:52.920 --> 19:59.960
them I always have problems trying my own side bangs so I might not keep them

19:59.960 --> 20:04.200
but I feel like they're too much of a staple I don't know it's gonna be rough

20:04.200 --> 20:14.480
it's gonna be rough I'm not sure my side bangs like gold on top of my hair and

20:14.480 --> 20:21.880
on my hair my eyes oh we're really going in with this what 50 Baku Deku

20:21.920 --> 20:27.160
tiktok's does to a motherfucker what do you mean what do you mean by that what

20:27.160 --> 20:35.120
do you mean by that huh nothing it does nothing to a motherfucker you saying it

20:35.120 --> 20:40.280
makes them emo or you're saying it makes them stupid and that's when my head is

20:40.280 --> 20:46.480
so small that's when my fucking head is so small yeah I also wanted to round out

20:46.480 --> 20:54.240
my eyebrows more I really really really really like round eyebrows so I'm

20:54.240 --> 21:02.040
gonna round out my eyebrows I've always really liked round eyebrows I think they

21:02.040 --> 21:10.840
really cute I already look so strange I feel like I'm literally just

21:10.840 --> 21:16.800
recreating my own model yet for some reason something's wrong side bangs are

21:16.800 --> 21:22.960
cute they are cute but I'm not good at I don't know for some reason a lot of us I

21:22.960 --> 21:29.720
feel like everyone in Bieler has such huge bangs we all have like humongous

21:29.720 --> 21:36.280
bangs have you guys noticed that or maybe except for Azura like I feel like

21:36.600 --> 21:44.200
Strani has huge bangs um let me pull up the actual model too so I don't have to

21:44.200 --> 21:49.080
keep maybe I can look look at my own reference just referencing my own art

21:49.080 --> 21:54.880
from my own hair Strani has huge bangs mercy has huge bangs I have humongous

21:54.880 --> 22:10.360
bangs um I see has huge bangs too it's not the size that counts it's the motion

22:10.360 --> 22:20.640
of the ocean all right and then I want to do I want to do this the little

22:20.640 --> 22:30.640
braids oh yeah I see it yeah we all have huge bangs does she be have bangs

22:30.640 --> 22:40.440
I'm trying to remember what she be say looks like it takes a long time to cross

22:40.440 --> 22:49.800
the ocean in a row boat what who does your hair because I can my monitor just

22:49.800 --> 22:57.120
died who does your hair because I can just get the same hair cut for $20

22:57.120 --> 23:05.900
rude big bangs big forehead yeah that too like it kind of gives me a really big

23:05.900 --> 23:14.560
which I guess you know is it really accurate though to have a big forehead

23:14.560 --> 23:21.680
because apparently my my actual head is like really really small underneath it

23:21.680 --> 23:28.960
right something like like to have the bumps I love floofy bangs like old

23:28.960 --> 23:41.200
anime yeah I guess that's true it does kind of I'm not really um I didn't watch

23:41.240 --> 23:46.800
a lot of old anime so I'm not really attached to like the old anime style you

23:46.800 --> 23:53.400
know I didn't watch a lot of old anime cuz I wasn't I only got into anime when

23:53.400 --> 24:03.160
I was in like seventh grade I think so most of the anime I watched was not

24:03.560 --> 24:09.720
battled I feel like I need to make this more angle

24:11.400 --> 24:22.720
I mean half bald no just give me some time to give myself here and right yes

24:22.720 --> 24:26.280
did I completely answer that I don't use a display tablet because I don't like

24:26.280 --> 24:34.080
having the display I like to look at oh she bees here hi she be hi thank you

24:34.080 --> 24:42.040
for coming and and and bringing bringing your hair I'm here how is your

24:42.040 --> 24:47.720
stream did you do I can't remember did you play the crab game a crabs adventure

24:47.720 --> 24:56.120
a crab something I think that's what it was oh god this is already looking bad

24:56.120 --> 25:03.920
someone said I look like Wendy from Wendy's like the like the um maybe I

25:03.920 --> 25:09.280
shouldn't make it them outwards like the fast food restaurant is that so wrong

25:09.280 --> 25:17.320
is that so bad to look like Wendy's I think Wendy's cute another crabs treasure

25:17.320 --> 25:27.640
yeah yeah yeah the mascot yeah the mascot from Wendy's you kind of do I'm I

25:27.640 --> 25:33.440
don't think I do I mean I'm about to make myself look more like it but I don't

25:33.440 --> 25:40.440
think I currently do are you gonna add freckles yes yes yes of course I'm

25:40.440 --> 25:48.240
keeping my freckles and like I said before do not take this stream as like

25:48.240 --> 25:54.000
an example of what the actual model will look like it's gonna look way cuter than

25:54.000 --> 25:59.820
anything you see here okay I promise or at least the art itself will look cuter

25:59.820 --> 26:05.000
maybe you won't like the design we'll see we'll see Wendy's approves round

26:05.000 --> 26:10.380
eyebrows yes I love round eyebrows and you know what I'm gonna make them big

26:10.380 --> 26:20.780
here yep big and round I love big round eyebrows

26:29.820 --> 26:34.460
you okay you're coughing a lot no I'm still sick

26:34.460 --> 26:46.340
hey Amy I'm finally getting a job congratulations oh my goodness I'm so

26:46.340 --> 26:56.060
proud of you being jobless kind of sucks I can understand the struggle how did

26:56.060 --> 27:04.540
they do this how did they make them look so cute because like when I had a job

27:04.540 --> 27:11.940
like cuz technically I I didn't need to have a job but my mom really wanted me

27:11.940 --> 27:21.020
to have one so you know I kind of had to be at her mercy and get a job and when I

27:21.020 --> 27:26.500
did have a job she would be like don't you just love having money and and having

27:26.500 --> 27:31.940
you know being able to buy what you want don't you just love it in my head I'm

27:31.940 --> 27:38.020
like no because like yeah sure I guess I can buy what I want and I'm talking about

27:38.020 --> 27:44.700
like a regular job like a like a I worked customer service and I was like

27:44.700 --> 27:49.340
no because sure I could buy what I want if I could fucking leave my house at

27:49.340 --> 27:55.860
any point other than to go to work because that's what I did I didn't leave

27:55.860 --> 28:02.260
my house other than to go to work or to go to school like what am I supposed to

28:02.260 --> 28:06.340
buy the things I want I can't leave my house otherwise I'm too fucking depressed

28:06.340 --> 28:12.020
I don't have the energy to it's sucked it's sucked but anyways I wish you

28:12.020 --> 28:16.540
luck at your job hopefully you're not like me and you can actually do stuff

28:16.540 --> 28:27.260
other than have a job like outside of your job right relatable right like I

28:27.260 --> 28:33.180

33:03.860 --> 33:15.320
a choker I just have a dent right up here that's my dent it's my headphone

33:15.320 --> 33:20.200

33:20.200 --> 33:36.480
headphone dent up there yeah that's the Tyler one dent my headphones just you

33:36.480 --> 33:40.440
know they made their they made their place they claimed their place on my

33:40.440 --> 33:48.640
head cuz I just wear them so often okay um I feel like I also should make the

33:48.640 --> 33:53.280
hair wider too sorry I'm really picky this might be a really um stressful

33:53.280 --> 33:56.240
stream to watch

33:59.200 --> 34:03.200
me like wider

34:03.200 --> 34:22.560
him so you do play league not a stinky league game or like you I think I made

34:22.560 --> 34:37.160
it too wide now that's cute right I feel like maybe I kind of something inside of

34:37.160 --> 34:42.280
me is telling me to flip these hair pieces so that they're facing outwards

34:42.280 --> 34:59.560
like that you're the opposite of stressful really really I feel like I'm

34:59.560 --> 35:05.600
very stressed especially when we play games together and I'm like what do I

35:05.600 --> 35:10.760
do especially if it's like a horror game if it's a horror game and I'm like what

35:10.760 --> 35:13.800
do I do tell me what to do please please please tell me what to do what do I do

35:13.800 --> 35:18.080
next please please please please and I'm like freaking out I can imagine that's

35:18.080 --> 35:22.880
like really really stressful to any viewer that's just trying to like watch

35:22.880 --> 35:35.480
it and enjoy the game but instead I'm like screaming at you like I love that

35:35.480 --> 35:47.520
about you okay good oh I do have some teal up I keep accidentally muting my

35:47.520 --> 35:54.520
mic the rule of cool slash cute is why Mercy has a giant pair of scissors in

35:54.520 --> 36:01.040
her skull also because of killer cool kill wait did you cool slash cute wait

36:01.040 --> 36:14.240
what did you say something else I didn't I don't get it that's normal for me

36:14.240 --> 36:20.320
being a person with three siblings oh good wait you have other siblings other

36:20.320 --> 36:27.960
than me let me try your tea it's not good it's yucky I only like sweet teas

36:27.960 --> 36:40.920
right wait I wanted a color I didn't really look up any colors to have I don't

36:40.920 --> 36:47.640
know kind the rule of cool is allowing something silly because it's it looks

36:47.640 --> 36:57.240
cool oh okay if it looks cool slash cute use it oh okay yeah that's a new level

36:57.240 --> 37:06.120
of cheating having other siblings you thought you were the only one yes yes I'm

37:06.120 --> 37:12.680
supposed to be the only one you have how dare you have other sisters other than

37:12.680 --> 37:23.760
me okay I actually don't know what kind of color let me look up um let me look up

37:23.760 --> 37:30.200
on Pinterest some collars and you can tell me if you like them or not okay

37:32.920 --> 37:37.400
color like choker color

37:37.400 --> 37:39.400
hmm

37:47.680 --> 37:57.080
what if it's an older sister it doesn't matter there's only me only me a food

37:57.080 --> 38:04.720
related color I'm not quite sure how I would do that

38:04.720 --> 38:06.720
hmm

38:16.240 --> 38:30.360
I like this one do you like this one how about that one hmm that's yay nay

38:30.520 --> 38:36.360
hmm yes it means the best little sister in the world and she's the only girl I

38:36.360 --> 38:44.080
needed in my life and I love her and what you like it you like it a bit simple

38:44.080 --> 38:48.320
well the other the rest of the design is gonna be I feel like I'm gonna have a

38:48.320 --> 38:57.200
lot it's gonna be a lot do you want to keep the Trinity not I don't know what

38:57.640 --> 38:59.640
what is the truth

39:09.640 --> 39:15.200
maybe I should keep the Trinity not not me not even knowing what's on my own

39:15.960 --> 39:27.600
okay okay okay you know what no we'll keep the knot you're right what's behind

39:27.600 --> 39:41.120
me she's right behind me isn't she she's staring at me from behind isn't she

39:45.200 --> 39:55.520
I think what I'll do is I'll just make it like an actual little like a tiny

39:55.520 --> 40:00.720
little pendant instead

40:00.720 --> 40:15.360
like that except like more even and good in the actual design like I said don't

40:15.360 --> 40:18.800
take this don't take this is what the model is actually gonna look like

40:18.800 --> 40:24.960
there's something like that she's right behind me yeah we'll keep the knot in

40:24.960 --> 40:44.280
don't worry we'll keep the knot maybe make it a little bigger the try not and

40:44.280 --> 40:47.600
the pentagram was a placeholder now it's too lazy to come up with an original

40:47.600 --> 40:53.160
design for an emblem at the time is the middle of summer don't judge me that's

40:53.160 --> 41:03.960
okay skin walker why do you have a Satanism taboo on your pelvis region

41:06.880 --> 41:15.480

41:15.480 --> 41:21.800
don't know I might change that I'm not sure if I like it I'm not sure if I like

41:21.840 --> 41:27.120

41:34.600 --> 41:45.000

41:50.240 --> 41:54.600
the shoulder now okay I talked to starting about this because it was

41:54.600 --> 41:59.760
something I really really really wanted to include but I'm not sure if we can do

41:59.760 --> 42:05.440
it what I wanted to do is I wanted to have it so off the shoulder that you

42:05.440 --> 42:12.400

42:12.400 --> 42:24.200

the shoulder that you could see like a little a little tiny bit from from the

42:29.120 --> 42:36.840
top of it like peeking through the top of the shirt but I know it might be

42:36.840 --> 42:46.960
risking it I know I know it's it's it might be too much I know it would be so

42:46.960 --> 42:54.040

50:36.980 --> 50:49.980
like that I think that's cute I think I don't know alright pockets pockets some

50:49.980 --> 50:59.620
some pockets understandable it is understandable I'm exposing my whole

50:59.620 --> 51:10.940
in musty to the world my entire in musty all right great I also wanted a belly

51:10.940 --> 51:18.340
button piercing where's my belly button I didn't draw in my belly button okay that

51:18.340 --> 51:26.180
doesn't look on that anatomically correct all women's pockets are useless

51:26.180 --> 51:33.300
okay is that how belly button piercings work I don't think that's correct

51:42.260 --> 51:46.940
that's a good change reflex for the skate for that for the frills I like to

51:46.940 --> 51:50.940
draw frills I like to draw a lot of frills frills are like one of my favorite

51:50.940 --> 51:59.260
things to draw other than hair I like to draw a lot of hair too so but I don't

51:59.260 --> 52:05.580
think it's a good change reflex at all I'm just trying to I'm just trying to get

52:05.580 --> 52:12.300
the drawing get the design down so that way I can like actually make it good

52:12.300 --> 52:22.820
when I'm alone you know I kind of want to bring the shirt down a little more

52:22.820 --> 52:26.340
just a little more

52:34.180 --> 52:37.820
as someone who has tried but absolutely cannot draw at all me this way to see

52:37.980 --> 52:45.580
shut your mouth don't put yourself down like that everyone can draw even you

52:45.580 --> 52:50.420
just some people have to you know practice more than others which sucks

52:50.420 --> 52:54.620
but that's just how it is for everything unfortunately some people just kind of

52:54.620 --> 53:03.340
pick up stuff faster than others but you know everyone can do it you shut your

today I found it really hard to draw your hair buns yeah that's something I

53:42.580 --> 53:51.740
noticed like it's a little bit confusing from some artists maybe so that's why I

53:51.740 --> 53:56.820
wanted to simplify it in this design it's just some cute rates

54:02.140 --> 54:15.340
get out of here with your dirty mind none of my Christian Minecraft server

54:19.020 --> 54:23.780
and I want to color this too okay yeah let me so let me just go look at women's

54:23.780 --> 54:29.820
belly button piercings real quick so I can see what it's supposed to look like

54:29.820 --> 54:38.460
my mom actually has a belly button piercing crazy in me lower so it's like

54:38.460 --> 54:49.100
the top part of the belly button in order to draw hands you have to go live in

54:49.100 --> 54:55.180
a cave and meditate for a cosmic revelation that's true that's how it

54:55.220 --> 55:00.740
feels like oh yeah and someone said they want me to have a septum piercing when I

55:00.740 --> 55:10.140
asked for design ideas alright sorry our mom has a belly button piercing isn't

55:10.140 --> 55:21.420
that crazy yeah someone said they want me to draw a septum piercing but I feel

55:21.460 --> 55:29.100
like this is not correct belly button piercing way and then maybe like a

55:29.100 --> 55:36.740

too big left sleeve needs to go down a bit oh you're right you're right you're

56:24.340 --> 56:28.300

okay wow these pictures are so disgusting um yeah okay okay I'll um I

59:58.180 --> 01:00:09.220
guess it goes pretty deep like that and then I'll put a little heart at the top

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:16.580
little heart piercing flight tongues you have to completely relearn to talk and

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:19.820
eat basically anything mouth related but if you have good muscle control you

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:24.300
can wiggle them independently that sounds like an awful trade-off oops I

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:31.100
wouldn't do this in real life but you know in um

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:40.060
there's my sweet tongue in anime whatever who cares it's anime

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:53.380

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:20.140
fucking hanging out of this there's yeah exactly there's no gust of winds on

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:28.700
the internet to worry about um this is my idea board okay so I'm really

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:33.420
conflicted on what kind of socks and what kind of shoes should I have one like

01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:38.180
warmers that's stupid looking what design on the pants you haven't thought

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:48.020
about that change it to a v-strake I'm not trying to get kicked off of you too

01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:04.140
unless you fart again that's actually such a cute little um that's a that's a

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:09.620
cute little visual for me just tooting and and my little skirt just flies up a

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:23.460
little bit okay I'm going to I'm gonna steal this shoe I'm gonna steal this

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:32.660
shoe I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with it I haven't decided that yet have a

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:38.260
sticker instead of pencil diabolical

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:42.420
is that right

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:45.420
really bad

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:54.260
this is why I don't do art streams because I need to focus I'm so bad at

01:08:54.260 --> 01:09:01.780
focusing on why aren't my feet fitting into the shoe

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:10.500
it still looks really big whatever it's okay it's okay is that our shoe too yes

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:21.460
stir-fish notes or socks but open on okay I'll look up what's there let me

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:24.140
look it up myself

01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:37.900
open on the heel is that what I mean is that what you mean but I'm not showing

01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:45.940
my feet though compression shoes I'm getting old your little sister has to

01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:57.020
start wearing compression socks um yeah I think I'll if they're leg warmers they

01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:05.580
would be like on top of the shoes so like like like like this

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:18.380
I'm like awfully drawn but like you know fold it on top of the shoes

01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:22.020
something like that

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:30.980
some big dot stompers might be nice true but I don't want to I don't know I don't

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:36.700
I'll kind of attached to your shoes I don't really want to get rid of them you

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:40.860
know I'm already getting rid of the sweater

01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:49.220
so I feel kind of like oh maybe I could have like a I don't want to bring this

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:56.660
all the way up maybe I could have like a like a band-aid kind of like what's

01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:06.500
going on here take my Tim's instead do we only own one pair well it's the

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:13.220
fucking ones you died in so yes they mean they mean something to me okay they

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:21.260
have meaning to them and then I'll just quickly trace these shoes

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:36.820
they look like sketchers like light up stompy sketchers it's our other pair

01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:43.140
shoes would be disproportional since you already have a short-sleeved

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:53.300
and grip t-shirt what's a Zetai real real key

01:11:54.540 --> 01:12:02.460
Zetai real what's that

01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:17.300
what does that mean what did you do to our dead party after we die oh my god

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:25.180
nothing I buried it I buried it don't worry don't worry I promise I buried it

01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:31.220
your sweater on the other hand I can't say the same thing I can't say I did

01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:39.660
nothing to that one bro I was so surprised once Johnny told me the back

01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:44.580
story behind the fucking sweater and shit I was like nah nah you just pulled

01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:47.940
that out of your ass right now there's no way that actually was planned cuz what

01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:59.580
the fuck I'm not telling you what it is cuz it's like what like what made you

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:03.580
think of that where where did this come from

01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:17.340
rigor mortis is great for long-lasting that's so fucking dark oh my god no no

01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:28.260
no if your erection lasts more than four hours please please seek medical

01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:34.700
assistance that's what that mean we think of

01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:46.620
terribly terribly traced shoes but yeah look why does it look oh it's cuz my feet

01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:50.820
are still inside of my shoes let me let me erase my feet

01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:04.340
there we go that looks kind of stupid doesn't it

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:11.540
Johnny's mind is scary yeah don't tell us what you did to everybody I won't tell

01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:20.940
you do the shoes light up that would be so cute oh my god like having um having

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:25.940
like a stomping animation and have the shoes light up that'd be really cute

01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:38.620
maybe I should do that I think it looks off I kind of agree

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:49.180
but I'm not sure oh maybe I just drew the shoe badly I forgot I left out like

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:55.140
the details maybe if I add more details it'll look better

01:14:55.140 --> 01:15:11.740
blink-do what's blink-do blink-do I'll think about lighting up the

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:27.940
sketchers because I think that's a really cute idea is that look better no I

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:38.700
think that still looks bad the leg warmers don't go far enough down hmm maybe

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:51.980
you're right I'll try to make them go far further down like like that

01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:03.780
does that look better thank you for helping me by the way I absolutely

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:11.180
appreciate any um any back seating when it comes to when I'm confused in art

01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:18.020
I think that looks a little better

01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:28.620
make them light up really that looks great oh sorry I didn't show the whole

01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:39.300
thing way better okay okay okay okay and then I'm just gonna um copy and paste it

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:41.820
to the other one

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:49.420
I love loose socks me too

01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:54.380
there we go

01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:11.660
oh it looks so cute new laurel dropped bro died from a tragic wheelie you you

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:15.340
were wearing airpods and you didn't hear me when I was yelling at you that you're

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:23.420
wheeling into traffic no and then I kind of like the band-aid uh I mean I know

01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:27.620
this isn't a band-aid it's probably a sock but like I kind of have a mercy

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:30.900

this is an awful heart what the fuck

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:25.700
there

01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:34.740
oh a skull a skull is a good idea too

01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:39.860
oh this heart is too

01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:50.660
it's a little bit too far out okay there

01:21:56.820 --> 01:22:00.260
and then have the dots because it's a

01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:04.580
because it's a belt

I'm close to

01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:05.940
there and then all of it needs to be even smaller

01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:10.340

if you if you angle it a bit I'm close make sense

01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:51.140

01:28:51.140 --> 01:29:02.340
um

01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:18.340
does that work are you sure

01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:27.300
like that like if I really rip it up

01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:40.740

01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:44.340
like it's too angled

01:29:51.460 --> 01:30:01.300
you like it you want I'm close don't piss me off I'm close is that what you want

01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:09.540
I know it's the same angle as the neckline but I don't know if it looks good

01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:11.620
that's what you want

01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:17.940
skew it to match the folding I can't free transform like that on

01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:24.660

01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:50.260
um

01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:57.220
I didn't actually expect to like any of these glasses this one's kind of cute

01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:12.260
let's do this let's also do this

01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:20.260

there super cute make them bigger okay let me finish actually drawing them and then I'll make them bigger

01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:42.580
and then they have a little dot in the middle

01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:47.860
oh I can't fucking see there we go

01:42:55.540 --> 01:43:00.820
the glasses with the strap that prevent them do you want me to be a hag I feel like that's

01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:10.900
very old person needle we have hags in the company it's not me I feel like that would make me look older

01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:14.420
you know what I mean

01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:23.700
an eyepatch to hide her demon eye to hide my sharring gun

01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:42.900
I love my little sister I love you too

01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:51.620
black dot left ones why why would I do that two eyepatches how am I supposed to see

01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:53.860
you're just drawing me at this point

01:43:58.740 --> 01:43:59.060
there

01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:09.140
I feel like these glasses are really big though maybe if I dried in my maybe once I dried in

01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:11.060
my own style it'll look better

01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:23.940
you don't need to see only listen to our voice that's kind of cute why is that kind of cute

01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:25.380
very cute

01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:39.940
big is cute makes you look smaller okay okay okay that um let me actually continue the art

01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:41.540
not the art but the

01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:48.740
the coloring and maybe make this a little darker too

01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:53.140
but then it's harder to see the blood

01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:00.420
looks like you're wearing your brother's glasses when they don't fit you really

01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:01.860
okay well if you like that

01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.180
and then my skin

01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:10.660
and

01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:14.420
just gonna

01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:22.020
and I uh I don't think the selection tool will work because my sketch is too messy

01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:24.980
well maybe uh not really

01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:30.020
are you shitting me

01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:42.020
the size selection thing is so annoying

01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:48.020
does this work oh I forgot to paint my nails too

01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:51.620
good enough for me

01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:08.660
everything Amy wears originally belonged to us yeah yeah this cute little mini skirt was yours

01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:15.940

are you secretly some little fem boy is that what you mean

01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:38.980
I hope the prescription is is the same I don't know what's your prescription

01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:44.980
I think I don't think everyone here's even wears glasses though

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.500
I don't know

01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:51.940
I want don't worry I won't I won't

01:46:58.180 --> 01:46:59.140
like you might

01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:06.900
I wouldn't mind I wouldn't mind but I'm still gonna tease you about it if you do do that

01:47:08.260 --> 01:47:09.460
because I think it's funny

01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:16.740
okay after I'm done with the skin I'll I'll redraw the

01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:20.580
the black nail polish

01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:32.660
negative 2.5 left negative 2.75 oh that's nothing

01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:38.820
onion stronger onion stronger prescription than that that's nothing

01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:50.420
our girlfriend our girlfriend where these what do you mean our girlfriend

01:47:51.940 --> 01:48:00.340

01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:15.940
the people's girlfriend

01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:23.220
isn't normal to know your own prescription because I have no clue what mine is

01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:27.700
no you don't have to know it it's not that big of a deal as long as your um

01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:33.540
um you know as long as your eye doctor knows that then it's okay

01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:37.380
can't spell in me without my yeah go on

01:48:44.180 --> 01:48:51.860
hive minding I'm gonna change my thong to black because this looks a little bit

01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:56.580
I don't know this reminds me of like I don't know this looks like a cowboy thong

01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:06.260
it's just it's giving cowboy thong and um I am not a cowboy so I'm good

01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:14.180
and here here it's giving like assless chaps you know

01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:19.540
tanned leather thong yeah that's what it reminds me of

01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:26.740
so I was just thinking like that sounds like it would hurt

01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:31.220
and also I'm gonna make my hair a little bit more

01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:39.940
a little bit more we're gonna do a bleach and tone here just a little just a little bleach and

01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:46.500
tone just a little just just tone it a little bit

01:49:48.980 --> 01:49:55.220
I still want it to be bright blonde but I don't want it to be like as bright because we're emo now

01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:04.820

she threatened us I threatened you what are you doing telling me to cowgirl it huh

01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:29.540
you're gonna get us both in trouble

01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:41.540
should I tell her is this not honest they want to get beat up please wrap them out

01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:53.940
she's not alive so they're getting rowdy in the cage yeah apparently

01:50:54.580 --> 01:50:58.100
they're getting a little thirsty for their little sister

01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:04.900
it's okay I promise I won't tell her don't worry I'm just teasing you

01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:16.100
castration I won't tell her but instead I'll make a deal with you give me your balls and

01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:24.260
you'll have my silence how about that give me your balls and I'll take I'll take I'll be silent

I'll shut my mouth I won't tell her a thing

01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:33.300
I need it for a spell

01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:38.020
CBT Tuesday

01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:44.420
also I kind of wanted to

01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:56.500
I kind of liked these sleeves I don't know maybe I'll have some red on the stripes on the socks

01:51:56.500 --> 01:52:02.260
I wanted to incorporate like the red more I don't want to only be black and white

01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:03.700
you know

01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:06.740
and maybe on the

01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:10.500
on the bandaid too

01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:15.060
have my sack ma'am thank you

01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:22.020
I'll steal them in your sleep you're gonna wake up and you're gonna you're gonna feel some emptiness down there

01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:27.380
but that's okay because you don't need them anyways

01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:37.460
I'll keep the same eye color maybe make it a little less bright

01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:48.100
I'm personally I personally feel like this this the brightness wouldn't really go well with this

01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:56.260
design because it's so like you know emo so we gotta mute the tones a little bit here

01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:12.260
I'm gonna put the X

01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:22.260
so

01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:34.260
there there's a terrible X I did what I could very thoughtful I know I am very thoughtful

01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:37.300
I'll do it when you can't feel it so that way you don't have to scream in pain

01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:44.020
Elden Ring playthrough would you want to watch watch me play Elden Ring

01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:47.300
oh my god I'm actually really liking this design now that I look at it it's really cute

01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:58.260
what is color theory at this point anyways I don't know

01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:04.500
like if you want something to pop you can surround it by muted colors but um

01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:12.500
we're emo we don't want anything to to pop out if you play I'll watch have you played a souls

01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:20.340
game before no people keep recommending them to me for some reason even though I've made it pretty

01:54:20.340 --> 01:54:25.540
clear like I'm not really a gamer so anything you recommend to me I'm gonna have a lot of

01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:29.780
trouble playing but if you're willing to watch me struggle that's okay

01:54:29.780 --> 01:54:35.460
as long as you're there to tell me what to do

01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:39.460
also what are your opinions on adding a different hair color like adding some streets

01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:45.460
would you want that I feel like it'll add to the emo-ness are you okay with that

01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:53.540
I'm not sure a lot I'm sure a lot of people watch you can't sit through souls like

01:54:54.500 --> 01:55:00.820
it is easily a tricky game I'm tired of every vtuber playing souls stop

01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:06.020
should I beat the one exception and not play souls then

01:55:07.780 --> 01:55:11.620
do they all really play souls games well there's probably a reason it's probably

01:55:11.620 --> 01:55:17.300
because they're popular a rat tail break ew what the fuck no I'm talking like the different hair

01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:25.460
color you know red streak pink could be nice maybe purple to match my eyes

01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:32.580
I'll I'll think about it after I add um

01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:36.900
after I add the rest of the colors

01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:40.260
can I

01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:52.100
purple would be nice add purple

01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:57.140
Esteban in your pocket I was debating on adding some rats in here

01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:00.100
I just feel like

01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:04.100
I don't know it's a lot of work

01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:09.300
it's a lot of extra work for me to draw and also a lot of extra work for the raker

01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:13.140
and I'm kind of lazy you know

01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:19.860
would you want a rat I probably wouldn't be able to include all of them

01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:26.100
and also it'd be really it'd be really extra depressing if they fucking die you know

01:56:26.980 --> 01:56:35.380
I like the orange black purple and red side by side purple streaks

01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:42.900
you want Esteban

01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:56.100
I don't need to worry about the cost but I also just need to worry about like how much

01:56:57.700 --> 01:57:05.460
like how much I can I can draw you know the cost isn't as big of a deal it's more how much I can

01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:09.140
I can make myself draw if that makes sense

01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:14.900
I uh because I want it to be something I can do like

01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:20.660
you know without too much stress in about it oops I forgot that I'm

01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:28.340
that I'm using the reflect tool

01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:34.820
do Dennis he's the most lore accurate

01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:43.140
Dennis is a girl don't misgender my rat I could do Dennis

01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:51.940
an unnamed rat no if I add a rat it needs to be named it needs to be one of my name

01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:58.580
or apex wait you want me to play apex if she played valorant I'd go crazy

01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:03.140
you'd go crazy with like rage watching me fail

01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:11.700
maybe save it for a possible future upgrade on the model

01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:13.940
that's a good idea

01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:23.220
all right what color oh yeah I wanted to I wanted to have red and black socks

01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:28.980
red and black scraped socks

01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:40.260
I feel like I feel like the shirt isn't dark enough maybe I'm just going crazy

01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:43.940
yeah it's okay for now

01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:50.100
I'm a little bit cuckoo cuckoo puffs cuckoo puffs

01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:58.980
FPS might be a bitch might be a bitch much I've never played um I think I played valorant

01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:05.460
I think I played valorant once I don't really play FPS but when I was a kid I used to be

01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:12.420
obsessed with this one FPS game it was an iPhone game and it was called battle bears are there any

01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:19.300
previous battle bear players in here I don't think it was a very popular game but it was like a

01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:27.940
little iPhone game and um it was a little shooter and I really loved but I really loved it I was

01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:29.860
really obsessed with winning that game

01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:37.460
was this synopsis it's literally just a shooter but instead of like like an FPS

01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:43.620
but you know all of the characters are just bears like teddy bears and stuff

01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:49.460
it seems like some of you know did you guys play battle bears

01:59:52.900 --> 01:59:54.340
I'll break do I want to make this

01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:05.620
nope hated the chainsaw motherfucker bro the chainsaw guy could like kill you in one hit

02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:13.300
I liked him I like to play him but I hated when other people would play him that was my grape

02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:25.220
I did when I was young battle bear stream I don't think it exists anymore

02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:27.780
and if it does exist no one plays it

02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:35.060
maybe I should do purple instead of red

02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:39.380
but I need something to tie in the red pins

02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:42.980
or should I make the pins black

02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:53.140
I never heard of it right red would be better bright red

02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:11.220
I don't know what are your thoughts on making the pins black

02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:14.180
I don't know

02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:19.860
what about gray

02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:26.980
maybe a lighter gray

02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:32.740
I kind of like gray

02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:39.380
could be a darker red I think you're right I think a darker red would look better

02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:47.940
I also feel like I need to make them bigger and move them

02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:04.180
if you want to go red the skirt needs to be different yeah maybe you're right

02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:10.900
maybe you're right because I feel like red and blue don't really look great together

02:02:13.380 --> 02:02:25.140
I think that looks okay gray looks good there's no pink anywhere

02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:27.460
well did I say that I would add pink anywhere

02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:33.140
silver

02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:38.420
silver what

02:02:39.300 --> 02:02:44.020
change skirt color you don't know is something wrong does something look off

02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:49.460
pink thong maybe that's a good idea actually

02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:54.500
I need to name like my layers more

02:02:56.500 --> 02:03:01.380
maybe maybe a bright pink thong it would look kind of corny though

02:03:03.380 --> 02:03:04.820
it would look a little tacky

02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:13.220
I don't know do you like that

02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:20.340
and maybe I can make the pins pink too

02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:37.220
like that I kind of like that I vote for black

02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:44.820
yeah it does stand out more pink and blue look good together not but not but not blue and

02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:52.260
but not red and pink ah fuck me pink and blue look good together but not red and blue I feel like

02:03:54.340 --> 02:03:59.220
here I can I'll make a poll for the thong color

02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:07.220
I'll make a poll for my my thong cover okay not color color thong color um start a poll

02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:18.260
these are the important questions okay what color thong pink black okay start poll

02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:27.860
okay which which color do you want let me know

02:04:28.020 --> 02:04:36.580
I see it's like pink is winning okay pink one oh or maybe not oh no it's going down now

02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:45.220
can we add red to the thong no because the thong because like this is this this is a gene

02:04:46.100 --> 02:04:50.340
this is a gene skirt and I feel like red and blue don't look good close together so I don't

02:04:50.340 --> 02:04:57.140
want to make the thong red both pink face with black rim um

02:04:59.780 --> 02:05:01.940
yeah I guess that's basically what's happening here

02:05:05.860 --> 02:05:09.220
okay pink is winning I'll end the poll

02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:16.180
the pink would make it pop more I agree I agree I agree

02:05:17.140 --> 02:05:21.220
yeah choose correctly heretics

02:05:23.380 --> 02:05:29.300
and it does match my eyes you're right okay um then I think I might make your

02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:37.380
I might make your shoes like white and black or should I make them pink too

02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:45.540
what happens if you shirt with the thong well I guess it's just gonna fall down out of my skirt

02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:48.900
no I'm not doing neon green

02:06:00.740 --> 02:06:05.300
I think I'll try doing pink and white for the shoes

02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:12.980
no

02:06:13.940 --> 02:06:24.420
what are shoes really be pink I guess not I guess not well I dyed them pink okay

02:06:26.100 --> 02:06:28.340
I recolored them for you

02:06:31.380 --> 02:06:34.420
fine I'll see what red how red looks with the shoes

02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:42.820
and if I don't like them I think I'll have to change them

02:06:47.380 --> 02:06:54.180
yeah I just used a sharpie to color them black I mean yeah or pink I just used a sharpie to

02:06:54.180 --> 02:07:00.740
color them that's all and then this is white

02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:04.660
is this yeah okay

02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:12.980
why wouldn't they be pink if you're also wearing our thong you're right you did say you wanted

02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:19.380
to have a magical girl sub theme yeah if you can think of like

02:07:20.980 --> 02:07:24.340
ways to make it more magical not magical but like um

02:07:25.220 --> 02:07:27.220
like

02:07:29.060 --> 02:07:36.900
like like I do magic basically add some magic elements but not magical girl

02:07:36.900 --> 02:07:42.340
because that makes it sound like an actual magical girl which I'm not aiming for

02:07:48.420 --> 02:07:54.100
you're so sweet what oh good night good night have a have a good more witchy yeah more witchy

02:07:54.500 --> 02:08:01.700
if you have any way to make it more witchy okay yeah the red doesn't the red is the red

02:08:01.700 --> 02:08:10.900
isn't looking right to me I think Amy being a magical girl villain character is worth its own

02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:20.820
concept yeah that's true yeah a cult a cult like that yeah the red doesn't match she right okay let me just

02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:26.340
I just uh I just bleached

02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:35.540
where's pink I just bleached your shoes it's okay you don't mind do you

02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:40.100
actually I'm not sure if I like pink either

02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:45.300
black and red with pink strings would look good you're right

02:08:47.460 --> 02:08:48.580
you're right it would

02:08:51.620 --> 02:08:55.300
not completely black but

02:08:57.940 --> 02:09:01.460
like that and then wait here

02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:06.260
and then make those strings pink

02:09:09.380 --> 02:09:13.140
yeah I'm never giving them back to you anyway so I can do whatever I want with them

02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:20.020
I could noot in them if I wanted to and then make you walk around in them

02:09:33.620 --> 02:09:37.220

02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:50.100
like like like even up here or like some

02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:59.540
some some strands of pink

02:13:02.100 --> 02:13:05.460
I feel like I'm making the strands look really bad that's my own fault

02:13:13.220 --> 02:13:16.420
I don't think I like the strands yeah it might be too much

02:13:16.980 --> 02:13:22.820
I don't think I like the side pieces pink either though I think I'll just leave it at that yeah

02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:31.940
a hair clip that's pink I wanted to incorporate these hair clips maybe instead of bozo make them

02:13:31.940 --> 02:13:37.780
these hair clips what do you think about that but that's too much pink in one area

02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:43.620
yeah I'll try not to overdo the pink

02:13:47.380 --> 02:13:55.460
I like the black ribbons I like them too that's a problem

02:13:57.540 --> 02:14:02.180
okay um let's color the band-aids

02:14:04.500 --> 02:14:07.060
real quick maybe I can do like um

02:14:10.660 --> 02:14:15.860
like a bright blue band-aid here six out of ten that one was that one was crispy

02:14:16.580 --> 02:14:17.460
that one was nice

02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:23.220
I don't think blue looks good

02:14:27.380 --> 02:14:31.460
does that look good do you like blue pink band-aid

02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:36.420
I think pink would be a little bit too close to my skin color

02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:40.900
do you like pink band-aid more

02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:48.020
you like the band-aid I have now should I just make it like I guess the band-aid I have now

02:14:48.020 --> 02:14:49.620
is pretty close to my skin color too

02:14:56.900 --> 02:15:00.980
regular band-aid the same one as you currently have

02:15:03.460 --> 02:15:05.140
try purple okay I'll try purple

02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:12.100
oh that's might be too might be too purple

02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:16.900
something like that do you like purple

02:15:17.140 --> 02:15:20.660
okay

02:15:30.740 --> 02:15:36.420
oh regular okay okay regular we'll keep the regular color then

02:15:41.220 --> 02:15:45.380
okay not completely okay their regular band-aid color

02:15:47.540 --> 02:16:00.820
purple looks like you stuck a big grape league chew to your face what's a grape league chew

02:16:00.820 --> 02:16:05.140
a grape big league chew what the fuck is that okay um

02:16:08.420 --> 02:16:11.460

02:16:18.180 --> 02:16:26.020
aw thank you I'm happy you like it I'm so happy you like it maybe the maybe the band-aid down here

02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:26.740
could be pink

02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:32.660
big league chew why are you acting so gay

02:16:33.300 --> 02:16:38.340

02:16:58.180 --> 02:17:04.660
candy bracelets oh that's kind of a fun idea we can do some sort of candy bracelets

02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:06.580
hold on let me see if a pink um

02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:18.580
let me see if a pink band-aid will look good here

02:17:23.940 --> 02:17:26.500
do you like pink I feel like this might be too much pink now

02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:28.500
no

02:17:32.580 --> 02:17:35.300
choose the limit it is the limit that's why I want two boyfriends

02:17:39.620 --> 02:17:43.780
I like the pink you like the pink okay looks fine okay okay

02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:51.780
um prick I forgot someone said something else and I forgot what what they said

02:17:51.860 --> 02:17:58.740
oh yeah candy bracelets okay let me look up some reference for what I um what that would look like

02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:13.140
okay so they're just like a bunch of different colored um beads right

02:18:13.620 --> 02:18:25.380
is that it don't piss me off I'm close it it might be a little too much

02:18:26.100 --> 02:18:29.540
oh something I also wanted to do was to have um

02:18:39.220 --> 02:18:40.820
I want to have some rips here

02:18:43.460 --> 02:18:49.700
I want to have some rips in the in the why can't I draw hello oh

02:18:59.780 --> 02:19:05.780
does that look bad I kind of like the rip to look you could do a candy bracelet made out of

02:19:05.780 --> 02:19:11.300
bone dice for the occult feel

02:19:13.700 --> 02:19:16.900
you look like an emo wannabe middle schooler and I'm into it

02:19:20.580 --> 02:19:22.740
I really like the gradient hair that's good

02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:31.700
yeah rips are a good touch I like rips I'll probably like I'll probably add more rips um

02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:35.060
um once I make the

02:19:40.980 --> 02:19:44.340
once I make the actual design but there have some rips

02:19:50.580 --> 02:19:54.740
but we've pivoted back into little sister territory that's good a wallet chain

02:19:55.380 --> 02:19:57.780
I could add the book

02:19:59.780 --> 02:20:05.460
on the other side do you think I should add the book I could change how the book looks I could

02:20:05.460 --> 02:20:13.860
make it an emo book I can make it look come on how do I super I don't know if I have those

02:20:13.860 --> 02:20:22.660
available yet I'm not sure yes at the book I was I was gonna make it look like my actual um

02:20:23.380 --> 02:20:31.380
um like my actual like witchcraft book that I use hold on let me find the amazon mustang

02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:40.660
I have to go back in my orders and find it um oh this is this is not the right amazon

02:20:43.620 --> 02:20:49.060
I can make it look like my actual book and it's emo yeah it's emo it's very fitting for this

02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:53.940
uh orders body can

02:20:56.740 --> 02:20:58.420
I had a long time ago hold on

02:21:05.140 --> 02:21:07.060
if I get it a long time ago hello

02:21:07.460 --> 02:21:14.820
is this only from this year

02:21:16.980 --> 02:21:27.060
page one of five show me all of the pages what

02:21:38.020 --> 02:21:43.540
ah damn it I don't want to oh I found it I found it I found it it's um

02:21:46.660 --> 02:21:52.820
here let me let me copy the image here it's this this is what it looks like and I think it's

02:21:52.820 --> 02:22:03.700
really fitting oh shit it's not yep I think it's really fitting don't you I'm ready to judge you

02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:08.020
this is not cute I think it's cute and I think it's fitting

02:22:13.140 --> 02:22:18.580
the book title don't piss me off I'm close no the book the book will stay as the lovers

02:22:19.780 --> 02:22:26.740
here I'll I'll do a terrible 3d I'll do a terrible 3d um rendition of it

02:22:27.460 --> 02:22:34.020
it looks dope I know it does and you were you were doubting me

02:22:36.260 --> 02:22:44.980
like that I think is that too big perfect right

02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:47.220
oh

02:22:54.260 --> 02:23:00.820
yes it does fit well I just have to figure out a good way to strap it to myself

02:23:04.020 --> 02:23:10.980
like okay this is gonna be a really bad like drawing of it but I'm trying

02:23:11.540 --> 02:23:13.540
I'm trying

02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:23.860
well I'm not trying hard enough but you know I will try when the time comes we're just trying to get

02:23:23.860 --> 02:23:34.180
the design now um okay so this is the backing so it shouldn't have any color just the book bind

02:23:34.900 --> 02:23:42.660
and then inside it should be like the colors here maybe a little darker

02:23:51.060 --> 02:23:59.540
maybe bigger a little overly detailed yeah I'll probably end up I'll probably end up simplifying it

02:23:59.620 --> 02:24:00.420
um

02:24:02.580 --> 02:24:04.500
just because it is um

02:24:08.980 --> 02:24:15.140
it is very detailed you're right and also I'll make a better version of it

02:24:16.580 --> 02:24:22.900
I'll add a better version of it I promise nail it to the left but this thing is on the left

02:24:25.460 --> 02:24:27.540
I'm just flipping it to my other side

02:24:30.260 --> 02:24:34.580
like that no it's from the top

02:24:38.980 --> 02:24:46.660
like that hammer it with hammer it in with the nail no I don't like pain that much

02:24:47.460 --> 02:24:51.620
maybe if you do it okay there

02:24:52.260 --> 02:24:58.820
a really shitty version

02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:08.900
do you want hammer or nails in the design still I don't think I want the hammer I don't think the

02:25:08.900 --> 02:25:17.700
hammer would fit it could perhaps be tucked under the skull belt it looks a little less busy

02:25:18.660 --> 02:25:20.100
under the skull belt

02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:24.980
I'm confused

02:25:27.540 --> 02:25:28.820
yeah it's some contrast

02:25:33.620 --> 02:25:34.820
maybe more pins

02:25:39.620 --> 02:25:43.620
are you saying you want nails in the design still is that what you mean

02:25:44.580 --> 02:25:49.460
a ghost of us floating around you

02:25:51.700 --> 02:25:55.220
are you asking me to draw like the pin pals um

02:25:57.060 --> 02:26:03.300
like the the the pin pals um oh sorry my mind is going blank

02:26:05.460 --> 02:26:09.860
like the fuck what's the word yes

02:26:14.180 --> 02:26:23.700
the skull belt on the thigh could be part of a book holster uh that's a really big book though

02:26:23.700 --> 02:26:31.460
to be put on my thigh right yeah mascot you want a math you want the mascot too but like a ghost

02:26:36.260 --> 02:26:41.380
is that what you mean you summoned us as a spoopy ghost that floats around

02:26:44.580 --> 02:26:51.460
I don't think I'm gonna include like actual lower accurate me chan here

02:26:54.980 --> 02:26:57.300
oh here I thought of an idea actually

02:27:02.100 --> 02:27:09.300
um

02:27:14.420 --> 02:27:19.940
um never mind never mind I was gonna say I could put the nails in my head instead of the pins but

02:27:19.940 --> 02:27:27.940
I uh Dr. Nova E from before me I already has that and I don't want to I don't want to copy that um

02:27:30.740 --> 02:27:38.340
on the book cover you and the mascot but I like this design I'm not gonna that's gonna make it look

02:27:38.340 --> 02:27:46.420
silly I think um if you need something smaller than a book there's always a turret deck yeah but

02:27:46.420 --> 02:27:55.060
the book has meaning you know to the lore so I feel like I should um keep it as a book but just

02:27:55.060 --> 02:28:00.580
like change change it a little bit why am I so bad at like

02:28:05.700 --> 02:28:06.660
am I doing this right

02:28:08.900 --> 02:28:14.340
whatever tummy mouth with a split tongue what's a tiny what's a tummy mouth

02:28:18.740 --> 02:28:23.860
I think adding more stuff might clamor it up clamor it up you mean like make it too busy

02:28:25.380 --> 02:28:31.380
are we the ghost on each hand or the mascot you're both

02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:36.900
I could I could add a little ghost mascot but I don't think I'm gonna do that now just because

02:28:36.900 --> 02:28:43.860
I'm getting really hot and sweaty so I think this will be here I'll make the tongue bigger

02:28:43.860 --> 02:28:50.180
I think this will be our design for now and I'm I might add a little more um

02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:52.340
um

02:28:53.860 --> 02:28:58.340
where's the tongue I might add like a few more smaller details myself but

02:28:59.060 --> 02:29:04.020
this is like the main point and you made it with me so that makes it special

02:29:06.660 --> 02:29:09.860
there and let me delete this list up here

02:29:10.180 --> 02:29:18.980
and maybe also color in the tongue what color is my tongue

02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:29.700
there

02:29:29.860 --> 02:29:38.500
there's my beautiful split tongue you're not ready for it

02:29:40.180 --> 02:29:44.900
should I add stitches to it or is that too much is that not sexy

02:29:46.660 --> 02:29:48.340
can you tell me if that's not sexy

02:29:51.940 --> 02:29:55.860
do you like that what are your thoughts on that

02:30:00.580 --> 02:30:05.220
I'm not making my tongue green yes the stitches no two stitches hot looks weird

02:30:06.260 --> 02:30:12.580
you don't know too much no stitches out I was asking for a split tongue me I am

02:30:14.260 --> 02:30:17.300
like plushie tongue not for me okay

02:30:20.420 --> 02:30:25.620
weird it's weird I think it's kind of hot I have no thoughts on that imagine if it falls apart

02:30:25.700 --> 02:30:30.340
no okay it seems like most people are saying no okay I won't add stitches I'll just keep it split

02:30:30.900 --> 02:30:31.140
there

02:30:34.340 --> 02:30:41.140
here's our final our final emi redesign I think it's hot good stitches are good okay

02:30:42.100 --> 02:30:52.340
I'll do another pull I'll do another pull for the stitches start a pull stitches on tongue or no

02:30:52.740 --> 02:31:01.540
no yes okay hold on stitches on tongue question mark yes no okay there

02:31:05.300 --> 02:31:13.620
cut my life into pieces this is my last resort I'll bring it back just to show you oops no

02:31:17.300 --> 02:31:19.380
this is what the stitches would look like kind of

02:31:23.060 --> 02:31:32.100
okay it seems like the majority want no stitches stitches are too much okay what happened to my

02:31:32.740 --> 02:31:35.860
oh there we go

02:31:46.340 --> 02:31:52.500
okay 62% want no stitches so I'll end it there and we won't have stitches on the tongue

02:31:54.740 --> 02:31:58.660
I'm converting to stitches you can't change in you can't change your mind now

02:31:59.620 --> 02:32:05.380
I'm imagining what kissing stitches would feel like probably not good but I'm not gonna lie I find

02:32:05.380 --> 02:32:12.900
it hot so I won't do it though if you don't want it I won't do it there maybe make the

02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:16.980
maybe make it a little more obvious that this is a

02:32:20.260 --> 02:32:21.940
make it a little more obvious that this is um

02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:23.000
um

02:32:27.380 --> 02:32:28.260
