you're a bad liar

193
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:31,240
it's part of the appeal like it's part of the appeal for some people i guess

194
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:47,160
to me i'm not weird i'm just being myself but i think it's a little off-putting to others

195
00:31:47,560 --> 00:32:03,080
oh he's kind of cute as long as you're not chain farting what's chain farting mean

196
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:17,880

197
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:34,680
partying simultaneously that's what chain farting is i don't get it

198
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:43,000

the animation is kind of cutely bad at some points

205
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,680
i guess it's just like reminiscent of like older shows

206
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:01,080
oh shit he's going sickle mode that was cringe i'm sorry

207
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:13,720

210
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,360
i wonder how much inbreeding happens here

211
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,360
so

214
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:29,400
you want that you don't think you'll get a little distracted

215
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:43,240
distraction is the point oh but don't you want to watch the show

216
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:57,240
um thank you for the one dollar your voice even any poking is involuntary

217

219
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:27,240

00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,920
but doesn't she already know

235
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,920
does that mean aang can fly

236
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,920
he matures a lot as the show goes on okay that's good

237
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:46,920
so

238
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:58,760
so

239
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:08,760
i'm sticking my tongue out to lick my fingers

240
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,600

241
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,960

248
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,040
but everyone was doing a meme one so i was like okay well i gotta do a meme one

249
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,960
i'm surprised didn't end with us passing out and you stealing our kidneys

250
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,000
that's because strawnee wrote it wrote it and not me if i wrote it i would have ended it like that

251
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,560
so

252
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,840
you love losing a hundred dollars in a dark alley you love you do you love losing your kidneys in a

253
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:51,560
dark alley too and you're pancreas and one of your lungs and your prostate

254
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:03,560
if it's for me

255
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:11,560
maybe not the prostate you already said yes though you can't take it back

256
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:23,400
so

257
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:37,400

330
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,600

00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:05,640

332
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,760
i love watching soca get owned

00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,160
that's what you get for being a bitch to your sister

334
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:26,120
oh damn he got a hit on him

335
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:30,920
uh oh

336
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,000
oh

337
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,160
yeah

338
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,840
ain't safe a day

339
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:05,920
I hope if you get a new outfit you use the old one for any kind of magic streams, it seems fitting.

340
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,920
I'll still use the old one sometimes too.

341
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,920
Of course, I still think it's cute.

342
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,920
You're the avatar?

343
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,920
No way.

344
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,920
Are you gonna watch the whole show with us eventually or is it just watching as far as we can today and that's it?

345
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,920
I feel like I should watch the whole show, right?

346
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,920
I just don't know if people would want to watch the whole thing with me.

347
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,920
It might be a little boring because it's such a long show, right?

348
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:52,920
Would you let me watch some episodes alone or do you want to watch everything with me?

349
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,920
Continue if you want to, that would be a fun to watch, watching it together.

350
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,920
I'll watch anything you want to watch?

351
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,920
Movie day stream? I can't stream all day.

352
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,920
Not today at least.

353
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,920
I'm not sure.

354
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,920
I'm not sure.

355
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,920
I don't want to watch it if people don't want to watch it, you know?

356
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,920
I'll watch it all with you, really?

357
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,920
We can pick up where you left off.

358
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,920
I'd be down and I'd be down.

359
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,920
I'd stick around.

360
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,920
Okay, okay.

361
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,920
I'd like to see...

362
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,920
I'd like some reactions to cut up footage at some point, though.

363
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,920
Some reactions to cut up footage?

364
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,920
Like clips where I show what I'm reacting to, is that what you mean?

365
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,920
If you don't like the series, then no one is having fun.

366
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,920
I have no problem with this so far.

367
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:22,920
I just don't want people to be bored by me doing come often.

368
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,920
Frequent watch-alongs, you know?

369
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,920
Maybe members only?

370
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,920
I don't know.

371
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,920
I feel like that's a dick move to put it behind a paywall, though.

372
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,920
Haha.

373
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,920
I feel bad for putting anything behind a paywall.

374
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,920
Wouldn't ever be bored?

375
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,920
Okay, if you want to.

376
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,920
Could be every two weeks.

377
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,920
It would be a really, really slow progress to finish the show

378
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,920
if I just watch a little bit every two weeks, right?

379
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,920
You know...

380
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,920
It would take forever to finish it.

381
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:29,920
Fatherless, fatherless, sad, fatherless child.

382
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,920
A little orphaned boy.

383
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,920
I suppose you wouldn't know about fathers.

384
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:43,920
We can fix your Zoomer brain rot once we run out of time?

385
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,920
But how would this show fix my Zoomer brain rot?

386
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:59,920
Oh my god, I'm literally so hot I can feel myself dripping sweat on the sides of my body.

387
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,920
Oh shit, I'm looking to gooo!

388
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,920
Dripping.

389
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,920
The avatar just escaped!

390
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,920
Hot? Really? Take some clothes off?

391
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,920
I'm not wearing anything underneath, though.

392
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,920
I don't really like being naked.

393
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,920
I'm not overdressed. I'm just wearing pajamas.

394
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,920
Hot.

395
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,920
You just want me to get naked.

396
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,920
Yep yep.

397
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,920
It's flying!

398
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,920
Haha.

399
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,920
We got the piss, now we need the sweat.

400
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,920
Now we need the sweat?

401
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,920
Chat, do you think?

402
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,920
You didn't get no...

403
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:29,920
Yeah, you got a little bit of piss, but what am I supposed to do with sweat?

404
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,920
Sweatbending is canonically a thing in this show, so it's kind of fitting.

405
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,920
I guess sweat is water, so yeah.

406
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,920
Ah, look at him sleeping like a little baby.

407
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,920
You know, non-live videos will always see what you're reacting to in the corner.

408
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,920
Cut up to a boring sort of thing.

409
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,920
If you can't, that's fine.

410
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,920
If you can, that's fine.

411
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,920
Non-live videos.

412
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,920
Non-live.

413
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,920
The only thing I can think of, I mean, thank you for the five dollars, Dan,

414
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,920
but the only thing I can think of is clips where I cut up my reaction

415
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:27,920
and then, like, edit in the show, the part of the show that I'm reacting to.

416
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,920
Oh, TTS, it's still audible? Oh, I'm sorry.

417
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:34,920
Here.

418
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,920
I muted it.

419
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,920
It's not audible to me, I can't hear it myself.

420
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,920
Sorry, sorry, sorry, I turned it off, I turned it off now.

421
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,920
Oh, shh, get shot on, Zuko.

422
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,920
How do they know that he's the avatar?

423
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,920
Is it just because he's got arrows?

424
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,920
Good girl.

425
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:00,920
Ah!

426
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:01,920
Ah!

427
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:02,920
Ah!

428
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,920
How do they know that he's the avatar?

429
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,920
Is it just because he's got arrows?

430
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,920
Good girl.

431
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:09,920
Ah!

432
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,920
Thank you.

433
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,920
He's an air banger, he's bald.

434
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,920
You'll find out.

435
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,920
Okay, all those are different answers.

436
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,920
Oh, no.

437
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,920
They'll explain?

438
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:35,920
Well, he's the last air bender.

439
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,920
Well, with that, I don't get it.

440
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,920
Like, he's the last one, yeah.

441
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,920
But why does that make him the avatar?

442
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,920
Because he's an air bender.

443
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,920
Bald power!

444
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,920
Oh, the arrows are distinctly air bender.

445
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,920
Oh, okay.

446
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,920
You'll find out.

447
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,920
Can you just fly away?

448
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,920
What are you doing? Just fly away.

449
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,920
Oh my god, this is when he gets awakened, right?

450
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,920
He had a dream about this.

451
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,920
He learned how to water bend!

452
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,920
Yo!

453
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,920
Look at him go!

454
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,920
Can't fly without his staff, oh.

455
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,920
The dream was how he got in the iceberg?

456
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,920
Oh.

457
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,920
Oh!

458
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,920
Jump scare!

459
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,920
They like break up serious moments in the air.

460
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:13,920
They're like,

461
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,920
they're like,

462
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,920

01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:17,920
they're like,

01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,920
they're like,

Why won't you sing because he didn't kill my grandma?

480
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,560
Because he didn't kill my grandma?

481
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,560
A dent? It's a saddle dent.

482
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,560
Game or basin?

483
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,560
He does have a dent in his back.

484
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,560
A dent in his back.

485
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,560
But doesn't he already know?

486
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,560
He did it pretty good.

487
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,560
Hop up, please, League.

488
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,560
A dent in his back.

489
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,560
I like that.

490
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,560
I also find it fun when people don't want me to ride them.

491
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,560
Okay, next episode.

492
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,560
Okay, episode three.

493
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,560
Okay, ready.

494
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,560
The amount of deleted messages after's, I said that.

Yes, I don't know what there are.

547
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,880
I need to go get my scissors, hold on.

548
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,880
I got two packages from you guys, I'm guessing.

549
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,880
Okay, let's open the first one.

550
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,880
Yeah, I said package.

551
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,880
Definitely lobotomy toys?

552
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,880
I'm not lobotomizing anyone.

553
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,880
Is it the bear? No.

554
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,880
I thought it was.

555
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,880
I thought it was going to be that.

556
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,880
Because it seemed like it would be.

557
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,880
But it's not.

558
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,880
I'm not actually sure.

559
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,880
I'm not actually sure what it is.

560
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,880
What is this?

561
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,880
Is it a rabbit? No.

562
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,880
Open.

563
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,880
What is this?

564
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,880
I have so many packages.

565
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,880
I'll thank you for becoming a pinpal jeery fish.

566
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,880
Is it from Throne? I'm guessing.

567
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,880
I've had so many packages lately though.

568
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,880
Wait, what is this?

569
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,880
But I don't really remember any of them.

570
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,880
I think it's my shock collar.

571
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,880
Oh my god, it's the shock collar.

572
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,880
I kind of want to try it out.

573
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,880
I want to try it.

574
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,880
Let's give it a quick test.

575
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,880
I want to test it so bad.

576
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,880
Doesn't need a charge?

577
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,880
You're right, I don't know.

578
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,880
Let's open this box.

579
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,880
It's so cute.

580
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,880
It's really stylish.

581
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,880
It's like a...

582
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,880
Oh god, I'm so scared.

583
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,880
Is it heavy?

584
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,880
No, not at all.

585
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,880
It's really light.

586
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,880
Let me see the instructions.

587
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,880
One of the devices down

588
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,880
unable to press the reset button.

589
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,880
The instructions will color it.

590
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,880
It's just black.

591
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,880
You can look on Throne if you want to know what it looks like.

592
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,880
I'm very confused on how this works.

593
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,880
The instructions are really badly translated.

594
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,880
When the device is down

595
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,880
and unable to operate, please press

596
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,880
the reset button to restart the device

597
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,880
in order to reset it.

598
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,880
There's only one button here and it doesn't make sense.

599
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,880
Did I do it?

600
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,880
Maybe it's dead.

601
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,880
Oh, there's an app!

602
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,880
Is there an app?

603
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,880
There is an app.

604
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,880
Press the padlock beam.

605
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,880
Oh my god, to lock it.

606
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,880
Oh my god.

607
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,880
Have you tried turning it on and off again?

608
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,880
Device online charging status.

609
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,880
They have a bunch of pictures in the instructions

610
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,880
where it says

611
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,880
there's a picture of the Hulk throwing the color

612
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,880
and it's like, do not throw.

613
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,880
And then there's a guy wearing it while running

614
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,880
and I'm guessing don't wear it while you're exercising.

615
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,880
There's another guy.

616
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,880
These pictures are so funny.

617
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,880
I wish I could show you.

618
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,880
Imagine if Pimpel is at control of it.

619
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,880
That's the goal, baby.

620
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,880
That's the fucking goal.

621
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,880
Oh my god.

622
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,880
Guys.

623
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,880
It comes with a lock.

624
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,880
It comes with a lock and a key.

625
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,880
Just take a photo and show us.

626
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,880
I will. After stream, I'll take a photo.

627
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,880
It comes with a lock and a key.

628
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,880
That's so fucking crazy.

629
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,880
Put it on.

630
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,880
I don't think it works.

631
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,880
I have to charge it.

632
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,880
I'm guessing.

633
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,880
I'm going to plug it in right now.

634
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,880
The gears are turning.

635
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,880
The gears are turning.

636
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,880
The gears are turning.

637
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,880
Let me plug it in.

638
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,880
Okay.

639
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,880
The next thing.

640
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,880
I also don't know what it is.

641
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,880
I have a feeling I know what it is, but I'm not sure.

642
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,880
If we can't control it directly, how about you do it manually

643
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,880
as in we give you a don't know and you activate it yourself?

644
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,880
Yeah.

645
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,880
Yeah, that works too.

646
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,880
Here, let me see.

647
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,880
Little devil.

648
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,880
Little devil.

649
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,880
Let me go on my phone to see if I can find the app.

650
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,880
Let me go on my phone to see if I can find the app.

651
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,880
Little devil.

652
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,880
That's such a strange name.

653
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,880
Because it shows that there's an app.

654
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,880
Maybe I shouldn't try to figure this out now.

655
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,880
The Bluetooth

656
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,880
After you

657
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,880
turn on the crawling mode.

658
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,880
Oh, this is really badly translated.

659
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,880
Bluetooth and crawling mode.

660
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,880
I know Shibi also got this shock color,

661
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,880
so maybe why would you get a shock color

662
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,880
if you have no one to shock you?

663
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,880
Doesn't seem fun to shock yourself.

664

when i connected it to my phone

819
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,880
it said that it's 88% charged already

820
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,880
so i'm hoping that

821
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,880
how tight does it need

822
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,880

832
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,880

01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,880
it's like multiple shocks

842
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,880
in a row the first one was really intense

843
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,880

01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,880
then it was like multiple small ones

845
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,880
after that

856
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,880
oh my god

857
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,880
it keeps scaring me every time i do it

858
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,880
i'll have to get used to it

859
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,880
okay okay let's try

860
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,880
oh i'm scared

861
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,880
i don't want to do it

862
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,880
i don't want to do it i'm scared

863
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,880
big brother got delayed by a work

864
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,880
i'm sorry for missing the stream

865
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,880
it's okay it's okay you came in at a good time

866
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,880
okay

867
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,880
you can do it

868
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,880
will you do a getting used to a membership stream

869
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,880
i could

870
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,880
is it safe to really shock yourself that often

871
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,880
it feels like um

872
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,880
like uh

873
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,880
like those shocks from like

874
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,880
what's it called

875
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,880
like those static shocks

876
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,880
it feels like static shocks

877
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,880
but it's all around

878
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,880
it's all around by neck

879
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,880
mostly in the front

880
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,880
i'm gonna drink some water

881
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,880
okay

882
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,880
so i tried soft i tried firm

883
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,880
so now there's tremor and then there's passion

884
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,880
those are the next two settings

885
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,880
that are left

886
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,880
i'll try not to scream

887
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,880

903
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,880
oh my god

904
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:16,880
they all kind of feel the same

905
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,880
they all kind of feel the same

906
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,880
i don't know i don't notice the difference

907
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,880
between these different modes

908
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,880
okay okay i'll try the last um

909
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,880
um

910
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,880
i guess you need to turn it up

911
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,880
it's already really intense

912
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,880
it's already really intense

913
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,880
i'll try the last one so the last one is tremor

914
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,880
trem scares me

915
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,880

916
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,880
i'm just

917
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,880
nah

918
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,880
we have some gaps between the morning

919
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,880
it's okay

920
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,880
maybe doing them enough times

921
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,880
they feel the same

922
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,880
i don't know

923
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,880
i feel like okay tremor

924
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,880
i'm scared tremor sounds really bad

925
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,880
okay don't be scared don't be scared don't be scared

926
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,880
wait that was nothing compared

927
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,880
to the last one

928
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,880
okay well i'm done

929
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,880
i'm done

930
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,880
oh my god

931
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,880
for some reason like

932
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,880
every time it shocks me

933
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,880
it makes me raise my shoulders

934
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,880
like

935
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,880
without me um

936
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,880
like wanting to it

937
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,880
like forces me to raise my shoulder

938
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,880
try again

939
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,880
can you find a way for chat to trigger this

940
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,880
am i allowed to do that on youtube though

941
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,880
like i feel like i

942
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,880
i feel like i shouldn't be allowed to do that on youtube

943
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,880
another one

944
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,880
you're nervous impulses that control them

945
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,880
normally are also electrical signals

946
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,880
you can try on twitch

947
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,880
i don't think we'll be streaming on twitch at all

948
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,880
another patch

949
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,880
i think the only thing you might

950
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,880
be reported for is self harm

951
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,880
it's not self harm

952
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,880
it's like the opposite of self harm

953
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,880
just one more

954
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,880
okay

955
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,880
i just unbuckled it somehow

956
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,880
come on

957
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,880
okay

958
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,880
this is the most fun

959
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,880
watch along i've seen

960
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,880
thank you for the eight dollars

961
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,880
strani was planning

962
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,880
on wearing hers for the elden rink stream

963
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,880
maybe ask her about what the rules are

964
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:30,880
okay but like if she says

965
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,880
like oh just don't really moan

966
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,880
don't try to make it sexually sound

967
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,880
i can't

968
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,880
dude

969
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,880
maybe behind members

970
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,880
maybe behind members i will

971
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,880
i feel like i have to make it a little

972
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,880
behind members streams

973
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,880
i hope i'm scared

974
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,880
i don't want to like die from this

975
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,880
it's like really intense

976
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,880
this is like really intense

977
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,880
okay

978
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,880
then just scream

979
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,880
i don't want to annoy my neighbors that much

980
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,880
you want one more passion

981
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,880
i'm scared

982
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,880
it like i sort of got it like throb sometimes

983
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,880

992
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:36,880
i want to leave that to charge

993
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,880

994
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,880

1003
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,880
it's scary to have it done myself

1004
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,880
i don't like being controlled

1005
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,880
i don't like being controlled

1006
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,880
in control of it

1007
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,880
we didn't get very far

1008
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,880
should i just restart the episode

1009
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,880
or should i wait until the

1010
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,880
stupid stopwatch

1011
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,880
not stopwatch but timer

1012
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,880
gets back to the time i was at

1013
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,880
we'll take control next time

1014
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,880

1016
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,880

i paused the timer for something

1020
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,880
but i actually paused the show itself at 327

1021
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,880

1022
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,880

01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:52,880
episode 3 season 1

1049
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:53,880
okay

1050
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:57,880
I think Amy will have some PTSD every time Zuko or Azura

1051
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:00,880
Azula lightning bends

1052
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:02,880
will I?

1053
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,880
it's okay

1054
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,880
it's not, I don't know

1055
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:11,880
I've never been shocked before so I guess I don't really know how to describe it

1056
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:13,880
other than like

1057
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,880
static

1058
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:17,880
okay ready?

1059
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:18,880
one

1060
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:20,880
two

1061
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,880
three

1062
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:25,880
okay

1063
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,880
did you like it?

1064
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:35,880
yes

1065
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,880
yes

1066
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:39,880
of course I liked it

1067
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:41,880
why else would I get a shock?

1068
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:49,880
only the avatar master hold four elements

1069
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:53,880
he vanished

1070
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,880
100 years passed

1071
01:40:55,880 --> 01:41:00,880
and my brother and I discovered the new avatar an airbender named Aang

1072
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:04,880
I hope we could use it on you too

1073
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:07,880
I'll try to set that up for you

1074
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,880
yes

1075
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,880
Aang can save the world

1076
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:28,880
why do I feel like Amy didn't take it off?

1077
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,880
I did

1078
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:33,880
I did

1079
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:45,880
she's fried

1080
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:47,880
I got cooked

1081
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:50,880
the electricians cooked me alive

1082
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:54,880
you're terrible here we come

1083
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:01,880
I got shocked by faulty wiring before so let me say wasn't a fan

1084
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:03,880
yeah

1085
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:05,880
I'm sure

1086
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:10,880
I'm sure too much is really painful of course

1087
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,880
you okay?

1088
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:17,880
yeah

1089
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:19,880
don't worry about me

1090
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:21,880
I did it to myself

1091
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:23,880
if I didn't want to do it I wouldn't have done it

1092
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:25,880
are you an aftercloth?

1093
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:27,880
kind of

1094
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:33,880
I want to do it more but that's not the point of this stream so I'm going to hold myself back

1095
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:35,880
okay

1096
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:37,880
okay

1097
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:42,880
I want to do it more but that's not the point of this stream so I'm going to hold myself back

1098
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:52,880
what brings you to my harbor?

1099
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,880
this

1100
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,880
sounds like you need some alone time after stream

1101
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,880
no I have other work to do

1102
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:13,880
I have so much stuff to do because I have to pre-record stuff because I'm going on vacation soon

1103
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,880
I can't

1104
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:27,880
it's aftercare good Amy

1105
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,880
thank you

1106
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:37,880
quickie doesn't take long

1107
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:42,880
well it's it does for me because there's a lot of cleanup

1108
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,880
you know

1109
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,880
for me

1110
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:05,880
I'm just doing the shower

1111
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:07,880
I guess I could

1112
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:11,880
I don't know I feel like it's not that comfortable in the shower

1113
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:13,880
and also I can't stand

1114
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:15,880
and I don't want to lay down in the shower

1115
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:31,880
damn he's in denial

1116
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,880
that his kind is all dead

1117
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:43,880
there's there's been an air bender genocide

1118
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:49,880
quick someone invent the shower bed

1119
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:54,880
I guess there's like chairs for showers but those are for old people

1120
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:56,880
ooh

1121
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:18,880
would you still be able to answer mirrors and Twitter stuff?

1122
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,880
yes yes yes I can

1123
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:26,880
I don't know how much because I'll be doing things on vacation

1124
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,880
other than being chronically online

1125
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,880
but yeah so I will still

1126
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,880
and there's still going to be content going up

1127
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:34,880
it'll just be pre-recorded content that's all

1128
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:36,880
like scheduled

1129
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:44,880

1139
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,880

1140
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,880

I have to go visit family

1151
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,880

01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:08,880
want to but I have to so yeah

1153
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:10,880

1154
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:17,880
have fun in your delusions

1155
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:19,880
I'll have fun in my dreams when I'm asleep

1156
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:21,880
thinking about you

1157
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:42,880

1158
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,880

01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,880
oh it's just a fire nation helmet

1161
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:56,880
will you record yourself thinking about Big Brother when you're gone?

1162
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,880
I'm going to visit family

1163
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,880
you pervert

1164
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:03,880
I'm not doing that with my cousins in the next room

1165
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:05,880
and my grandmother in the kitchen

1166
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:07,880
no

1167
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:09,880
and I'm sleeping with my mom

1168
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:12,880
because they don't have an extra room for me alone

1169
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,880
so no

1170
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,880

monkey atzo

1174
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,880
there's always the excitement of getting caught

1175
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:39,880
I don't like that excitement

1176
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:41,880
that's not for me

1177
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:43,880
I prefer not doing that kind of stuff

1178
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:57,880
no

1179
01:48:57,880 --> 01:48:59,880

1180
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:01,880

1188
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:41,880

1189
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:47,880

1190
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:49,880

1194
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:57,880

1195
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,880

I assume we don't

1197
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:25,880
I guess I can't considering you're

1198
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,880
so

1199
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:30,880
tempted for me to do it but don't worry like

1200
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:32,880
I'll still post twitter audios

1201
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:35,880
I'll just have to make them

1202
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,880
be recorded

1203
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:44,880
