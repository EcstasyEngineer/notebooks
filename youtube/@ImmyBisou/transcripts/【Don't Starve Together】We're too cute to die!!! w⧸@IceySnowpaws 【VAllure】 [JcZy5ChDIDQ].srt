00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:22,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:52,980
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:59,880
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,980
Hi!

6
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,980
Hi everyone!

7
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,980
Hello!

8
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,980
Hi!

9
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,980
Hi!

10
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,980
Hi!

11
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,980
Hi!

12
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,980
Hi!

13
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,980
Hi!

14
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,980
Hi!

15
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,980
Hi!

16
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,980
Hi!

17
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,980
Hi everyone!

18
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,980
Hello!

19
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,980
Hi!

20
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,980
Let me shrink us down a little bit.

21
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,980
We're playing Don't Starve!

22
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,980
Together!

23
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,980
And as you can see,

24
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,980
I'm a ghost and I already died

25
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,980
and we didn't even start playing the game.

26
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,980
Yeah.

27
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,980
We both don't know how to play this game.

28
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,980
Both of us don't know how.

29
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,980
Well, I see knows a little bit you said, right?

30
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,980
Yeah, no.

31
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,980
I didn't play this game

32
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,980
in literally like years

33
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,980
so I barely remember anything at all.

34
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,980
Okay.

35
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,980
Well, barely anything is...

36
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,980
You have to figure it out!

37
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,980
Barely anything is more than nothing.

38
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,980
So how do I go back?

39
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,980
Okay, close. I'm still alive. Hello!

40
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,980
Exam and I see...

41
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,980
Hello!

42
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,980
Wait, you're...

43
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,980
Treat?

44
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,980
With a treat?

45
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,980
How do I get a treat?

46
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,980
Chat, if you want to backseat us,

47
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,980
please do it!

48
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,980
Walk to skill...

49
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,980
Wow, well...

50
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,980
Did it say she will live in Valhalla?

51
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,980
Oh.

52
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,980
Well, that's great.

53
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,980
Do you want to restart the game?

54
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,980
Yes, let's restart.

55
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,980
Okay!

56
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,980
Oh, my God!

57
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,980
Best collab.

58
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,980
You started the collab already dead.

59
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,980
Unless anyone knows how to...

60
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,980
Unless anyone knows how to revive.

61
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,980
I think you revive going to the door.

62
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,980
Oh!

63
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,980
Can you walk into the door?

64
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,980
Oh, let me see.

65
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,980
Um...

66
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,980
Did it do anything?

67
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,980
Oh?

68
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,980
Okay.

69
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,980
Um, give me nothing.

70
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,980
It takes a lot to revive another player this early.

71
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,980
Okay, well, let's restart then.

72
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,980
Yeah, let's just...

73
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,980
Let's just restart.

74
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,980
I'm going to disconnect, okay?

75
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

76
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,980
How do I leave?

77
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,980
What do I do? Disconnect?

78
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,980
Yeah.

79
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,980
Okay.

80
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,980
All right.

81
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,980
I'm going to delete the world

82
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,980
that we just played in.

83
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,980
Um...

84
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,980
Okay.

85
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,980
I actually don't know how to do that,

86
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,980
so I'm just going to create another one.

87
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,980
Yeah, and then just invite me

88
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,980
the same way you did earlier.

89
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,980
Okay.

90
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,980
Um...

91
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,980
Okay, good.

92
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,980
I'm going to put the same password, okay?

93
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,980
Okay, okay, okay.

94
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,980
Um...

95
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,980
Friends only.

96
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,980
Okay. Generate world.

97
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,980
We're off to a great start.

98
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,980
Yes.

99
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,980
We jumped into the game a little early.

100
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,980
Yeah, just a little.

101
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,980
No one can even hear the music on my side.

102
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,980
Really?

103
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,980
Yeah.

104
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,980
Can you hear it on my side?

105
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,980
I don't know.

106
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,980
I can open your stream.

107
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,980
I was too lazy to

108
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,980
separate the audio.

109
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,980
I'm not good at separating audios.

110
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,980
I'm not...

111
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,980
I'm actually not separating it.

112
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,980
Oh.

113
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,980
I'm not separating mine.

114
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,980
It's the audio.

115
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,980
I'm really bad at like

116
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,980
making sure that you're loud enough

117
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,980
while also having the game loud enough.

118
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,980
Mmm.

119
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,980
So I have to separate it, but I don't know how to separate the game.

120
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,980
Oh, okay.

121
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,980
We can hear the opening of the music.

122
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,980
Yeah, you hear it.

123
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,980
Okay. They hear it on my side.

124
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,980
Okay.

125
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,980
Let me invite you.

126
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,980
Okay.

127
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,980
Close the buttons.

128
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,980
Shift tap.

129
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,980
Okay, there we go.

130
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

131
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,980
Yay!

132
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,980
Okay, let me

133
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,980
do this.

134
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,980
There we go.

135
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,980
It's like Terraria.

136
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,980
Like Minecraft.

137
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,980
Okay.

138
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,980
I've played Terraria in Minecraft.

139
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,980
Have you?

140
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,980
You basically...

141
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,980
Me? Yeah, I've played here and there.

142
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,980
Okay, so we should be good.

143
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,980
Basically,

144
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,980
from what I remember, you need to

145
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,980
like, you know,

146
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,980
craft stuff and like

147
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,980
find things to

148
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,980
survive, basically.

149
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,980
And during the night,

150
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,980
you need to make sure that you have fire, I think,

151
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,980
so that,

152
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,980
you know, you don't

153
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,980
die like me.

154
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,980
Okay, okay.

155
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,980
Let's go, let's go.

156
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,980
Okay, I'm going to pick some flowers.

157
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,980
I don't know if that's going to be useful, probably not.

158
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,980
Let me get some saplings.

159
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,980
Maybe we need those.

160
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,980
Fuck.

161
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,980
I think, yeah, saplings are good

162
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,980
to build a fire, right?

163
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,980
I think.

164
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,980
Me too.

165
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,980
Okay, I'm getting some seeds.

166
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,980
Should I not touch that beehive?

167
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,980
Or should I touch it?

168
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,980
I probably

169
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,980
wouldn't, just in case.

170
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,980
Okay.

171
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,980
Unless you're a big...

172
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,980
I found some berries.

173
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,980
That will keep us from being hungry.

174
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,980
The music is too loud for me again.

175
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,980
Off, zero.

176
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,980
Okay, there.

177
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,980
Yes.

178
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,980
Why is the game music still on?

179
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,980
I don't know.

180
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,980
Oh, ambient volume, that's why.

181
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,980
Okay.

182
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,980
What's this?

183
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,980
Oh, I found a carrot.

184
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,980
I found a carrot.

185
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,980
Pick it, pick it. Can I...

186
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,980
Oh, there's a bee. Careful, will it sting you?

187
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,980
I don't know.

188
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,980
Oh, did it just go away?

189
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,980
No, it's on the floor. It's got legs.

190
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,980
Oh.

191
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,980
Okay.

192
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,980
Find stones so you can make a...

193
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,980
I can't read.

194
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,980
Oh, tools, tools.

195
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,980
Oh, we need stone.

196
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,980
Okay, hello.

197
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,980
Any stones in chat?

198
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,980
Any stones in chat?

199
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,980
Any stoneers?

200
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,980
Oh, I'm going to pick up the carrot.

201
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,980
Well, there's a lot of food here

202
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,980
and we need food to survive.

203
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,980
And maybe you can find some...

204
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,980
Oh, I found some flint.

205
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,980
Is that what they mean?

206
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,980
Maybe.

207
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,980
Anything in here? No, no.

208
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,980
Oh, here's more flint.

209
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,980
Nice.

210
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,980
Where did I get meat from?

211
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,980
We probably need to make a tool

212
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,980
to hunt.

213
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,980
Do we need a crafting table in Minecraft?

214
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,980
Um...

215
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,980
Tools.

216
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,980
Oh, I think...

217
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,980
I think...

218
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,980
On the left side at the top...

219
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,980
Mm-hmm.

220
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,980
Uh...

221
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,980
If you see, like, we can

222
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,980
craft because we have twigs.

223
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,980
I crafted myself an axe.

224
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,980
On the left side, there's, like,

225
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,980
different tools and you can see

226
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,980
if you have enough to craft.

227
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,980
So now I have an axe.

228
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,980
Okay, I'll get an...

229
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,980
And I can attack.

230
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,980
I can attack.

231
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,980
Kill the bee!

232
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,980
Okay, never mind.

233
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,980
Mistakes were made.

234
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,980
Oh, fuck.

235
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,980
Can we kill them?

236
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,980
Can we kill...

237
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,980
I'm just going to run away.

238
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,980
Oh, shit.

239
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,980
Oh, shit, I just crafted

240
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,980
a...

241
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,980
Nice!

242
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,980
Cool!

243
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,980
We can chop trees now.

244
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,980
What do we need?

245
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,980
We need grass in order to make

246
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,980
a fire...

247
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,980
a torch, I think.

248
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,980
So let me get some grass.

249
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,980
Oh, I see the torch.

250
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,980
Yeah.

251
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,980
Like, if you click on the

252
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,980
very thing on the very top

253
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,980
of the left, like, slide thing,

254
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,980
if you click

255
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,980
light sources, you can

256
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,980
either make a campfire

257
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,980
or a torch.

258
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,980
I'm making a torch right now.

259
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,980
Okay.

260
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,980
I should have

261
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,980
enough to make a campfire soon.

262
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,980
Now we're surviving.

263
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,980
Now we're mining

264
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,980
and crafting.

265
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,980
Oh, it's getting dark!

266
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,980
Oh, it's getting dark.

267
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,980
You have coming towards you.

268
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,980
Okay, how do I...

269
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,980
How do I...

270
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,980
There's the campfire!

271
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,980
We're safe.

272
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,980
Okay, we're going to be okay.

273
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,980
We're going to be okay tonight.

274
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,980
I'm going to get more wood.

275
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,980
How did you

276
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,980
put down the campfire?

277
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,980
I just clicked on the button

278
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,980
and then placed it down on the floor.

279
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,980
Hmm.

280
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,980
Oh, okay.

281
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,980
Okay, I see.

282
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,980
I see.

283
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,980
I'm going to get...

284
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,980
You should be able to.

285
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,980
Can I kill the birds?

286
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,980
You can try.

287
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,980
Attack! Attack! Attack!

288
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,980
Damn it.

289
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,980
You can meet with it.

290
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,980
Hmm, let me see.

291
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,980
People are talking about

292
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,980
hounds.

293
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,980
Hounds?

294
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,980
What about them?

295
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,980
That they're coming.

296
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,980
We'll be fine.

297
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,980
I'm not worried.

298
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,980
I'm a bear.

299
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,980
You have me by your side.

300
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,980
I'll maul them and fight them off.

301
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,980
Okay.

302
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,980
Apparently, I need to

303
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,980
feed the fire.

304
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,980
At fuel.

305
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,980
Oh, the gloom and croaches.

306
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,980
Oh, that's so scary.

307
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,980
Why does your character say such

308
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,980
scary things?

309
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,980
Because of my mental illness.

310
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,980
Oh, my God.

311
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,980
What's this thing? It's a butterfly.

312
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,980
Is it?

313
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,980
Yeah.

314
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,980
Can I kill the bird?

315
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,980
I'm trying to kill the butterfly.

316
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,980
It won't let me attack the butterfly.

317
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,980
I wonder what we could

318
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,980
even do with a butterfly, to be honest.

319
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,980
Eat it.

320
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,980
I'm pretty confident in our

321
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,980
so I think we're doing really good right now.

322
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,980
I mean, so far.

323
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,980
Yeah.

324
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,980
Should we release the hands?

325
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,980
There's hands in this game?

326
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,980
A what?

327
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,980
Someone said, should we warn them

328
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,980
about the hands?

329
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,980
What do they mean the hands?

330
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,980
What hands?

331
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,980
Is there hands in this game?

332
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,980
This game got hands?

333
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,980
What do they mean by that?

334
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,980
I'm too stupid

335
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,980
to understand.

336
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,980
What hands?

337
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,980
Wait, my character only eats meat?

338
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,980
Oh, no!

339
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,980
Really?

340
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,980
Really?

341
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,980
How is I supposed to know

342
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,980
that when choosing the character?

343
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,980
Oh, no!

344
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,980
Oh, no!

345
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,980
How much is your hunger?

346
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,980
It's a 56.

347
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,980
56?

348
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,980
Minus 85!

349
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,980
Oh, no!

350
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,980
How do I add to the fire?

351
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,980
How do I add to the fire?

352
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,980
You have to have logs, I think.

353
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,980
Or maybe we can add to other stuff.

354
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,980
Can I add a pine cone?

355
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,980
Or you can add other stuff.

356
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,980
How do I...

357
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,980
I'm adding fuel.

358
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,980
I'm adding fuel.

359
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,980
Did I make the fire too early?

360
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,980
I don't think so.

361
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,980
I mean, you picked one of the hardest

362
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,980
characters in the game.

363
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,980
Oh, no!

364
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,980
I picked the character

365
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,980
that looks like me.

366
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,980
Why are the sides of my screen

367
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,980
going weird?

368
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,980
Is it because...

369
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,980
I think it's because I ate.

370
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,980
As soon as I ate, it did that.

371
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,980
Like, look.

372
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,980
Oh, wait. Never mind.

373
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,980
Maybe it's not because I ate.

374
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,980
You're overheating?

375
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,980
Me eating here

376
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,980
while you're fucking starving and dying.

377
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,980
It's because you're near the fire.

378
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,980
Okay.

379
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,980
It's getting lighter.

380
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,980
I'm going to try and find you some meat.

381
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,980
I have four meat in my inventory.

382
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,980
Can I cook it?

383
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,980
Where did you find meat?

384
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,980
It came with me

385
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,980
when I spawned, I think.

386
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
Oh!

387
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,980
Well, that meat is going to run out.

388
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,980
Should I eat?

389
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,980
When's a good time to kill the creatures?

390
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,980
Don't cook.

391
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,980
Don't cook. Oh, they spoiled?

392
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,980
Bro, this game is so hard.

393
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,980
We can do it.

394
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,980
We can do it. I believe

395
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,980
we are smart

396
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,980
young ladies.

397
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,980
We're smart.

398
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,980
Independent young women.

399
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,980
Yeah.

400
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,980
We can make this on our own.

401
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,980
You can kill Icy for me.

402
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,980
What are you doing?

403
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,980
Watch out, Icy.

404
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,980
Don't fall asleep near me.

405
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,980
Oh, no.

406
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,980
I'm not supposed to eat you.

407
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,980
What the fuck?

408
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,980
Now I feel even more pressure

409
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,980
trying to find meat for you.

410
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,980
Jesus Christ.

411
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,980
Find me food or else I'll eat you.

412
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,980
Yeah, what the fuck?

413
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,980
Can I replant the trees?

414
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,980
I feel like I've been

415
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,980
Oh, no.

416
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,980
Oh, fuck.

417
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,980
Can I eat the mushrooms?

418
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,980
I don't know.

419
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,980
Can you?

420
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,980
There's a chicken.

421
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,980
There's a chicken.

422
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,980
I'm screaming.

423
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,980
I'm fighting.

424
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,980
I'm dying.

425
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,980
I'm coming.

426
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,980
I'm coming.

427
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,980
I'm coming.

428
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,980
I'm coming.

429
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,980
I'm attacking them.

430
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,980
How do I attack them?

431
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,980
Oh, now they're attacking me.

432
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,980
I can't attack them?

433
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,980
You should be able to.

434
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,980
Fuck you.

435
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,980
Where's my health?

436
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,980
I'm okay.

437
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,980
Oh, fuck.

438
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,980
My health is so low.

439
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,980
My health is literally 19.

440
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,980
Okay.

441
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,980
I'm coming.

442
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,980
I'm coming to get the frog.

443
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,980
Where is it?

444
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,980
The frog fights back.

445
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,980
Is this food?

446
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,980
Oh, I found a spear.

447
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,980
Froglet.

448
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,980
I think we should kill that chicken.

449
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,980
The turkey.

450
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,980
The turkey, yeah.

451
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,980
No, it's too fast.

452
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,980
Come here.

453
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,980
What is it doing?

454
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,980
Come on.

455
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,980
Let's get it.

456
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,980
Yes.

457
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,980
Get the other jumpsick.

458
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,980
You take it.

459
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,980
You need me to survive.

460
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,980
I can survive on other stuff.

461
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,980
Like carrots and berries and stuff.

462
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,980
You can be the vegan.

463
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,980
Vegan bear.

464
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,980
What the fuck?

465
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,980
And a polar bear.

466
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,980
That was supposed to be the most vicious bear.

467
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,980
Help.

468
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,980
Someone said

469
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,980
anytime you're not full

470
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,980
is a good time to eat on your character.

471
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,980
Oh.

472
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,980
We have to replant the trees, apparently, too.

473
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,980
Really?

474
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,980
Yeah.

475
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,980
How do I

476
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,980
regain my health?

477
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,980
I need to craft bandages or something.

478
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,980
How do I replant trees, too?

479
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,980
Form two weapons

480
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,980
aren't clothing healing.

481
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,980
Oh, it's going to fall.

482
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,980
Fuck.

483
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,980
Ashes, rocks, spider gland.

484
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,980
Spider gland.

485
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,980
Oh, shit.

486
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,980
I don't have the stuff to make a campfire.

487
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,980
Rope. How do I make a rope?

488
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,980
Why is there a path here?

489
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,980
Oh, fuck.

490
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,980
I don't know.

491
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,980
Do you have leaves?

492
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,980
Do you have grass?

493
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,980
I think.

494
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,980
Let me see.

495
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,980
It's going around cooking it.

496
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,980
Petals.

497
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,980
Cut grass. Yeah, I have that.

498
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,980
Can you give it to me?

499
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,980
Yeah.

500
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,980
I dropped it.

501
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,980
I can make a campfire.

502
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,980
I'll wait a little longer, I think.

503
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,980
I think I should wait a little longer.

504
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,980
Don't wait until it's pitch black.

505
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,980
Okay.

506
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,980
Nothing.

507
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,980
I really need to get some healing.

508
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,980
I am on 19 health.

509
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,980
How do you?

510
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,980
I need grass and rope.

511
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,980
Oh, okay.

512
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,980
How do I make rope, though?

513
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,980
How do I give you some of the grass?

514
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,980
You drag it, I guess.

515
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,980
I make rope

516
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,980
with cut grass.

517
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,980
Okay, here. Take the cut grass back

518
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,980
so you can make rope.

519
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,980
Okay, let me see.

520
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,980
Okay, so...

521
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,980
One...

522
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,980
Don't use all of it, though, because we need it for a campfire.

523
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,980
No, is this...

524
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,980
I don't know how to...

525
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,980
Huh.

526
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,980
What do you mean? Well, how am I supposed to...

527
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,980
How am I supposed to heal then?

528
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,980
No.

529
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,980
Help us!

530
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,980
Snowberries, pin pals, please.

531
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,980
You need to craft a science machine.

532
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,980
You have to unlock TAC in the menu.

533
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,980
Don't stop to get this weird.

534
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,980
Oh, that is fucking shit.

535
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,980
What the fuck?

536
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,980
Lysors, prototypes, and stations?

537
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,980
Oh, science machine.

538
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,980
We need a gold nugget

539
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,980
and four rocks and four logs

540
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,980
to make a science machine.

541
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,980
Where in the fuck am I gonna find

542
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,980
a fucking golden nugget?

543
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,980
Come on.

544
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,980
Jesus Christ.

545
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,980
Well, how do I make healing items?

546
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,980
That's so stupid.

547
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,980
Where do we find gold nuggets from rocks?

548
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,980
Turn on your flower thingy for the ghost...

549
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,980
Ghosts? There's ghosts in this game?

550
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,980
Yeah.

551
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,980
Oh, I think...

552
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,980
There was a pickaxe, right?

553
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,980
So we have to... we can make a pickaxe

554
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,980
and mine the rocks, probably.

555
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,980
Okay, let's look for more flints and sticks.

556
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,980
Oh, maybe I should make one.

557
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,980
Oh, fuck.

558
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,980
How do I get out of this screen?

559
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,980
How do I get out of this screen?

560
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,980
What?

561
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,980
What?

562
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,980
Fuck.

563
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,980
Fuck.

564
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,980
Oh, God.

565
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,980
You scared me.

566
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,980
I'm sorry.

567
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,980
Help.

568
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,980
Oh, my God.

569
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,980
I was trying to, like, pick up my torch

570
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,980
because I got so scared and nervous

571
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,980
I forgot where it is

572
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,980
and where to click.

573
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,980
Oh, my God.

574
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,980
There's eyes in the darkness.

575
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,980
It's okay.

576
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,980
They will not hurt us.

577
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,980
Can I cook the mushroom?

578
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,980
I can.

579
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,980
What the fuck?

580
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,980
I don't think I can eat it. Here, have the cooked mushroom.

581
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,980
Here you go.

582
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,980
Oh.

583
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,980
Did it just suddenly get dark for you?

584
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,980
I mean, get light for you.

585
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,980
It's bright.

586
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,980
Yeah, it's bright for me.

587
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,980
How did that happen?

588
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
I don't...

589
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,980
Wait, I don't...

590
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,980
What the fuck?

591
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,980
I only have four health.

592
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,980
Oh, shit.

593
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,980
Did the mushroom take away

594
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,980
my health?

595
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,980
Oh, no.

596
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,980
Did the mushroom hurt you?

597
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,980
I don't know.

598
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,980
I'm not gonna eat it.

599
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,980
My health went to, like, four.

600
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,980
Oh, fuck.

601
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,980
I'm going to need seeds.

602
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,980
Oh, fuck.

603
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,980
There is...

604
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,980
Oh.

605
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,980
Oh.

606
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,980
Oh, God.

607
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,980
Um...

608
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,980
Okay, okay, let's focus on...

609
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,980
Okay, I need...

610
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,980
We need Flinton and Twigs to make a pickaxe

611
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,980
so that we can get...

612
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,980
So that we can make the science station.

613
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,980
Yeah.

614
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,980
Here's... Okay, Twigs.

615
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,980
Okay.

616
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,980
Do you get Twigs from the saplings?

617
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,980
Yeah, yeah, you do.

618
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,980
Okay.

619
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,980
I'm gonna get rid of the green cap mushroom.

620
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,980
I don't trust it.

621
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,980
Go away, mushroom.

622
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,980
I'm sorry.

623
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,980
It's okay.

624
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,980
You didn't know.

625
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,980
Well, here's more Twigs.

626
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,980
I'm so scared of dying, honestly.

627
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,980
My health is so fucking low.

628
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,980
It's okay, we'll get that station.

629
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,980
We'll get that station.

630
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,980
We'll get it, we'll get it.

631
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,980
I just... I need a Flint.

632
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,980
I can't find any anywhere.

633
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,980
Yeah.

634
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,980
I don't see, like, a lot of Flint.

635
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,980
Cooked green mushrooms are minimally poisonous,

636
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,980
but restore sanity.

637
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,980
Oh, oopsies.

638
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,980
Shit.

639
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,980
Where's all the stones?

640
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,980
Oh, there. What is this?

641
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,980
Charcoal. Oh, fuck, that's not what we want.

642
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,980
That's not what we want.

643
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,980
Can I go in the water?

644
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,980
No.

645
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,980
I don't know. I tried going in the water,

646
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,980
but I didn't...

647
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,980
There's a monster in the water!

648
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,980
With seven health left,

649
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,980
I don't think I should be going there.

650
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,980
Personally.

651
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,980
Press M to bring up a map if you get lost.

652
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,980
Oh!

653
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,980
That's helpful.

654
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,980
Does this say...

655
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,980
Oh, it shows where everything is.

656
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,980
Is that a gravestone?

657
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,980
Or is that rocks?

658
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,980
I don't know.

659
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,980
If they chose the base characters,

660
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,980
would it have been easier?

661
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,980
Well, I wanted to choose a character that looks like me.

662
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,980
Yeah, exactly.

663
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,980
I wanted to choose cute character.

664
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,980
Yeah.

665
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,980
Who cares if it makes the game harder?

666
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,980
At least I'm pretty.

667
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,980
Yes.

668
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,980
Exactly. That's how I feel about games.

669
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,980
As long as I can look pretty,

670
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,980
that's all that matters.

671
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,980
Oh, there's an animal track.

672
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,980
There's a gravestone here.

673
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,980
Where?

674
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,980
Press M.

675
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,980
I realized some guy.

676
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,980
Are there treasures?

677
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,980
Why do I not see on the map?

678
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,980
Oh, shit.

679
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,980
We're too far away from each other.

680
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,980
Maybe we should go back to each other.

681
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,980
Um...

682
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,980
Wait, is that Flint?

683
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,980
Oh, no.

684
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,980
No, no.

685
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,980
Oh, I see you.

686
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,980
Come on.

687
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,980
We're here.

688
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,980
Come on.

689
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,980
Come on.

690
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,980
I need me.

691
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,980
Come on.

692
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,980
What are these things?

693
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,980
I don't know, but it looks like

694
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,980
it could be meat.

695
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,980
I need to heal really badly.

696
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,980
Fuck.

697
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,980
I'm your bitch.

698
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,980
Why did you say you're my bitch?

699
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,980
Come on.

700
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,980
You need to make traps to bait them into.

701
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,980
It means hungry.

702
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,980
Oh, fuck.

703
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,980
I'll eat.

704
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,980
I'll eat.

705
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,980
Here, come.

706
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,980
I'll give you the food that I have

707
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,980
that isn't...

708
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,980
that isn't meat.

709
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,980
Can you eat seeds?

710
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,980
Yeah, but I don't think seeds

711
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,980
makes my health go up.

712
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,980
How do I drop stuff?

713
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,980
I still have 7 health.

714
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,980
Can you eat pine cones?

715
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,980
Oh, I can plant the pine cones.

716
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,980
Oh.

717
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,980
Oh, that's how we replant them.

718
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,980
Oh, okay.

719
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,980
That's good to know.

720
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,980
Okay.

721
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,980
Do you have stuff to make a...

722
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,980
Um...

723
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,980
Do you have stuff to make a campfire?

724
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,980
Let me see.

725
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

726
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,980
Should I put one right now?

727
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,980
No, wait until it gets a little darker.

728
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,980
Okay, let me know when to put it down.

729
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,980
Okay.

730
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,980
Can't cross river without a boat.

731
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,980
Man, this game is like...

732
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,980
This game is Minecraft on hard mode.

733
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,980
Is this...

734
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,980
Is this a rock?

735
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,980
Is it?

736
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,980
Abigail's flower.

737
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,980
Are you Abigail?

738
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,980
Am I?

739
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,980
Who's Abigail?

740
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,980
Literally who?

741
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,980
Literally who?

742
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,980
Oh, there's more flowers over here.

743
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,980
Okay, okay.

744
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,980
And there's a carrot up there.

745
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,980
Oh, thank god.

746
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,980
And there's carpet on the floor?

747
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,980
Is this carpet?

748
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,980
Marble tree?

749
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,980
Do you see this?

750
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,980
What is this?

751
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,980
What is this?

752
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,980
I don't know.

753
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,980
Give the flower to Hershey.

754
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,980
Can you use the flower to do something?

755
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,980
Here's Abigail's flower.

756
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,980
Oh, no.

757
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,980
What do I do with a flower?

758
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,980
Oh, there's another monster over here.

759
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,980
Oh, no, it's gone.

760
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,980
Oh!

761
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,980
Abigail!

762
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,980
It's a ghost!

763
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,980
What do you desire, Apparition?

764
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980
That's my twin sister.

765
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,980
Cool!

766
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,980
Will I protect you?

767
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,980
Okay, okay, get the fire, get the fire, get the fire!

768
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,980
Where's the campfire?

769
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,980
Where's the campfire?

770
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,980
Come on.

771
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,980
Give me campfire.

772
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,980
Oh, fuck!

773
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,980
I'll protect you.

774
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,980
I'll protect you.

775
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,980
Where's your items? Can I pick up your items?

776
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,980
Okay, let me try to pick up your items so that I can build a campfire.

777
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,980
Oh, my god.

778
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,980
Fuck my life.

779
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,980
I can't see anything.

780
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,980
Oh, god.

781
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,980
What happens if I go towards these eyes around me?

782
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,980
Let me see.

783
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,980
And the curtain falls.

784
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,980
Nothing happens when I walk towards the eyes.

785
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,980
Oh, I get hurt. Okay.

786
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,980
Okay, okay, okay.

787
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,980
Okay.

788
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,980
Let's see who's keeping Amy alive.

789
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,980
Yeah, probably. My sanity is at 20, though.

790
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,980
I think we should restart the game.

791
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,980
Let's just go back into your body.

792
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,980
No.

793
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,980
I was playing, I was hunting a fucking torch.

794
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,980
Apparently.

795
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,980
You can hunt items?

796
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,980
I don't know.

797
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,980
How do I hunt a...

798
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,980
survive?

799
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,980
Okay.

800
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,980
Should we restart the game?

801
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,980
Do you want to?

802
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,980
Should we?

803
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,980
Well, I don't think I'll be able to bring you back to life.

804
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,980
Okay, let's try it again.

805
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,980
And I'll try to be more careful

806
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,980
with my health this time.

807
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,980
And not fight

808
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,980
freaking frogs.

809
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,980
Okay, okay.

810
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,980
I'm getting attacked by my own sanity right now.

811
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,980
That's too real.

812
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,980
The demons are actually attacking me right now.

813
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,980
And I'm fighting them back with my axe.

814
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,980
I can see that.

815
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,980
Okay, I'm going to disconnect.

816
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,980
Okay, okay, okay.

817
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,980
Me too.

818
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,980
Damn it.

819
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,980
A touchstone.

820
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,980
It's okay. We'll do better.

821
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,980
We'll do better.

822
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,980
I'm going to be extra careful.

823
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,980
That was a test run.

824
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,980
Yeah, that was just a test run.

825
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,980
We can do so much better.

826
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,980
I believe.

827
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,980
Okay.

828
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,980
Okay, a host game.

829
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,980
Another world.

830
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,980
Should I try relaxed?

831
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,980
Or is that too easy?

832
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,980
I feel like that would be too easy, right?

833
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,980
Yeah, we need a

834
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,980
we need a

835
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,980
challenge.

836
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,980
Yeah, we need a challenge.

837
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
We need to prove to everyone how powerful we are.

838
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,980
We need to prove to everyone how powerful we are.

839
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,980
We need to prove to everyone how powerful we are.

840
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,980
Okay.

841
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,980
Generate world.

842
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,980
Okay.

843
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,980
I'll choose a different character this time.

844
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,980
I'll choose one that's easier.

845
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,980
Okay.

846
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,980
And I'm making a sandwich.

847
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,980
Mm-hmm.

848
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,980
What sandwich are you eating?

849
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,980
Um...

850
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,980
Hungarian salami

851
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,980
with Havarti cheese on bread.

852
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,980
Mm, that sounds good.

853
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,980
It is good.

854
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,980
Sounds better than the seeds I was eating.

855
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,980
I'm eating, like, high quality meat.

856
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,980
I'm eating the seeds.

857
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,980
I'm eating the seeds.

858
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,980
And I'm the fucking bear.

859
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,980
Like, what the fuck?

860
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,980
Oh my god.

861
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,980
Lumberjack has an axe that can't break and eats wood.

862
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,980
I always liked him.

863
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,980
He sounds like a character, but I don't want to play as an ugly lumberjack.

864
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,980
Okay, that's too real.

865
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,980
I want to play as a cute girl.

866
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,980
That's me in all video games.

867
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,980
Actually, you know, like, when I was a kid

868
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,980
and I just started, like,

869
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,980
getting to, like, know stuff about video games

870
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,980
and all of that stuff.

871
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,980
Mm-hmm.

872
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,980
I completely refused to play any video games as a kid.

873
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,980
I completely refused to play any video games as a kid.

874
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,980
The main character wasn't a girl.

875
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,980
I completely refused playing the video game.

876
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,980
I was like,

877
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,980
I'm not playing as a guy.

878
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,980
If I'm playing a video game,

879
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,980
it has to be with a girl character.

880
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,980
Otherwise, I completely refused to play it.

881
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,980
How can I be immersed

882
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,980
if it's not a girl character?

883
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,980
Real and true, I agree.

884
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,980
I kind of did the same thing,

885
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,980
like with Mario Kart and stuff.

886
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,980
Like, I would play the cute girl characters.

887
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,980
Aw, that's really cute.

888
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,980
I might as well just meet you.

889
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,980
Okay, I'm going to join.

890
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,980
Okay.

891
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,980
Someone said the spider is cool.

892
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,980
I can play as a spider?

893
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,980
Wait! I want to play as a spider.

894
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,980
Yeah, Weber.

895
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,980
Oh.

896
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,980
I didn't know that.

897
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,980
Well, that was the best story character

898
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,980
because she has a lighter.

899
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,980
Okay, well, the spider is cool.

900
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,980
Okay.

901
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,980
Does the spider have

902
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,980
good cool powers?

903
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,980
Males in my video game?

904
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,980
Hell no!

905
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,980
Spider won't eat veggies.

906
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,980
Spiders will help you.

907
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,980
Spiders will attack him.

908
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,980
That's it!

909
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,980
That's it!

910
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,980
Maybe I shouldn't...

911
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,980
You can eat monster meat.

912
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,980
Okay.

913
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,980
I actually think the character I picked now

914
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,980
should work better

915
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,980
because I can actually equip like a teddy bear.

916
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,980
You choose Willow?

917
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,980
Yeah, like, I can have like a teddy bear with me,

918
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,980
which is perfect because it's like

919
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,980
I have a plushie over Snow Berry

920
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,980
with me to protect me.

921
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,980
That would be cute.

922
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,980
Cute, look!

923
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,980
It's you, Snow Berry!

924
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,980
Okay, I'm going to choose Wilson

925
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,980
just because he's the other starter character.

926
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,980
Are you sure? I mean, you can still pick

927
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,980
whoever you want.

928
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,980
No, it's okay. I want to actually be able to survive.

929
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,980
Okay.

930
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,980
Oh, look at this thing!

931
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,980
You has meat?

932
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,980
No.

933
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,980
They can't treat me.

934
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,980
Oh, what's this?

935
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,980
Plugged sinkhole.

936
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,980
Oh, god, now the frogs go away.

937
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,980
What?

938
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,980
Let me pick berries.

939
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,980
How do I get out of the screen? What?

940
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,980
What screen?

941
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,980
I'm stuck in the...

942
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,980
the like, menu.

943
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,980
Really?

944
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,980
What the heck?

945
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,980
Oh, tab? Oh, there we go.

946
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,980
Okay, there we go.

947
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,980
I wonder if that rock...

948
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,980
Okay, I'm going to try real quickly, pick up everything I can

949
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,980
before it gets dark.

950
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,980
There's a pig house.

951
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,980
Oh, go away!

952
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,980
Oh, my god, I have PTSD from the frogs now.

953
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,980
I can never look the same at them.

954
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,980
What happened?

955
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,980
Where are you?

956
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,980
I jumped in a wormhole.

957
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,980
Did you die?

958
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,980
No, I'm alive. I came out the other end.

959
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,980
Okay, I'm going to jump in as well.

960
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,980
Where am I?

961
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,980
I don't know.

962
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,980
But I need to be around you here. I'm here.

963
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,980
Okay, thank you.

964
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,980
There's a negative sanity but teleportation.

965
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,980
Check the map.

966
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,980
That's cool.

967
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,980
Oh, it brought us like, kind of far away.

968
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,980
Maybe we could like, jump back in it

969
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,980
when we want to go back to the other area.

970
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,980
That would be pretty useful.

971
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,980
Yeah, that is useful. Okay.

972
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,980
Yeah.

973
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,980
Okay, that's cool.

974
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,980
And my sanity is good. I have high sanity.

975
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,980
Look at that.

976
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,980
Yeah, my sanity is pretty good as well.

977
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,980
Yeah, look at that big-ass head.

978
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,980
That's where I store all my sanity.

979
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,980
That's exactly why I need to take

980
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,980
my retard medication.

981
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,980
Because my brain gets so big

982
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,980
and swollen.

983
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,980
I need a medication to stop the swelling.

984
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,980
Otherwise, my head will explode.

985
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,980
Your brain just can't handle

986
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,980
all of your sanity.

987
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,980
Yeah, my brain is too powerful

988
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,980
for its own good.

989
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,980
Oh, Flint!

990
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,980
Flint!

991
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,980
Oh my god.

992
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,980
Will the bee get mad at me

993
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,980
if I pick the salmon bee?

994
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,980
That bee or not the bee?

995
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,980
Okay, let me get

996
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,980
an axe.

997
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,980
An axe.

998
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,980
A torch.

999
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,980
Ah!

1000
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,980
What happened?

1001
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,980
I'm getting chased by bees!

1002
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,980
Oh no!

1003
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,980
I did nothing, though.

1004
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,980
Let me equip a torch.

1005
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,980
Maybe that will help.

1006
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,980
I don't know, but maybe.

1007
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,980
Okay, I think they stopped.

1008
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,980
They stopped.

1009
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,980
Oh, I just noticed

1010
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,980
that there's a clock

1011
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,980
at the top of the screen.

1012
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,980
I didn't see that before.

1013
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,980
It shows what time it is.

1014
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,980
Okay.

1015
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,980
Why is there

1016
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,980
road

1017
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,980
paths on the floor?

1018
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,980
Why?

1019
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,980
Where?

1020
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,980
Like...

1021
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,980
Torchier.

1022
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,980
Oh, I think

1023
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,980
if I just get close to that bee thing,

1024
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,980
they automatically just come running to me.

1025
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,980
I'm going to equip the torch

1026
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,980
just in case.

1027
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,980
Okay, thank you.

1028
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,980
Do you have enough to make a campfire?

1029
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,980
Um, no.

1030
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,980
But I'll make an axe

1031
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,980
so that I can get wood for a campfire.

1032
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,980
Okay.

1033
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,980
Paths make you move faster.

1034
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,980
Oh, that's cool.

1035
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,980
Okay.

1036
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,980
I have a good feeling about this.

1037
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,980
Yeah, I think we're going to be okay.

1038
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,980
I can actually eat stuff

1039
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,980
other than meat this time.

1040
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,980
Yeah, and I'll be extra careful

1041
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,980
with my health and not fight

1042
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,980
army of frogs.

1043
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,980
Can I...

1044
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,980
I can't plant seeds.

1045
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,980
Okay.

1046
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,980
Wendy is immune to fire.

1047
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,980
What?

1048
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,980
I guess you can sit on the campfire if you want.

1049
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,980
Really?

1050
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,980
Birch.

1051
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,980
Oh, space

1052
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,980
to pick up the nearest thing.

1053
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,980
I've been clicking on everything.

1054
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,980
Oh, space?

1055
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,980
Yeah.

1056
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,980
Oh, I didn't know that.

1057
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,980
Wait, waiting for Icy to accidentally start a forest fire?

1058
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,980
Icy, start a forest fire.

1059
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,980
Should I?

1060
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,980
Okay.

1061
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,980
Get really close to the tree.

1062
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,980
Here you go.

1063
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,980
Oh, you get sanity by burning things.

1064
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,980
That's cool.

1065
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,980
It's not going to spread, is it?

1066
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,980
Oh, that's fire!

1067
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,980
Oh, no!

1068
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,980
That's fire!

1069
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,980
No!

1070
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,980
Oh, no!

1071
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,980
No!

1072
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,980
Oh, fuck!

1073
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,980
Aren't you... I thought you were immune to fire.

1074
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,980
Oh, wait.

1075
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,980
I wasn't on fire.

1076
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,980
Oh, no, the fire is spreading.

1077
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,980
Okay, so...

1078
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,980
Never mind, the fire is spreading.

1079
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,980
It's only a little bit.

1080
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,980
It will be fine.

1081
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,980
It gives us lots of light.

1082
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,980
Yeah.

1083
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,980
We won't even need a campfire,

1084
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,980
because we can just...

1085
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,980
Oh, there's charcoal.

1086
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,980
Yeah, light's everything on fire.

1087
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,980
Yeah.

1088
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,980
And it gave us charcoal, too.

1089
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,980
I'm so smart!

1090
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,980
Yes, you are!

1091
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,980
Let's go!

1092
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,980
Whoa!

1093
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,980
Here, I'll light more things on fire.

1094
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,980
Awesome!

1095
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,980
That was so fun.

1096
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,980
I love lighting things on fire.

1097
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,980
It's all leafy.

1098
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,980
Light it!

1099
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,980
Nice.

1100
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,980
And light this one, too.

1101
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,980
Nice.

1102
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,980
Nice!

1103
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,980
Yeah, charcoal is good for fuel.

1104
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,980
Nice!

1105
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,980
That's my hunger, I like.

1106
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,980
Good.

1107
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,980
Oh, I actually have a lighter.

1108
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,980
I didn't realize that.

1109
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,980
The torch has duration.

1110
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,980
Oh.

1111
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,980
How do I...

1112
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,980
Oh, I see the 40%.

1113
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,980
Okay.

1114
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,980
Oh, now I'm getting too hot.

1115
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,980
And the staff, I can...

1116
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1117
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,980
Oh, God.

1118
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,980
I can't fire. I can't fire.

1119
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,980
I'll make one, I'll make one.

1120
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,980
Hold on. Oh, I can't.

1121
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,980
I don't have enough. I did it.

1122
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,980
Okay.

1123
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,980
And then maybe feed it.

1124
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,980
It's okay.

1125
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,980
There we go.

1126
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,980
I didn't even have to make a campfire.

1127
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,980
Oh, my God.

1128
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,980
Yeah, we're fine.

1129
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,980
It's daylight again.

1130
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,980
We're good.

1131
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,980
Can I take it back?

1132
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,980
I don't think so.

1133
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,980
I doubt it.

1134
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,980
Okay.

1135
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,980
What do I do with the pedal?

1136
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,980
Oh, wait.

1137
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,980
We should build a science machine, right?

1138
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,980
What stuff do we need for it again?

1139
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,980
We need to get gold.

1140
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,980
Where the fuck am I going to find gold?

1141
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,980
Uh, dig in your nose.

1142
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,980
Okay.

1143
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,980
Twigs and flints to build a pickaxe.

1144
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,980
Twigs and flints.

1145
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,980
Okay, okay.

1146
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,980
I'll look for twigs and flints.

1147
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,980
Gold is from rocks.

1148
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,980
Got it.

1149
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,980
This is going to give me a twig, right?

1150
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,980
We need to explore and find a biome with rocks.

1151
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,980
They are rocks with gold vein.

1152
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,980
Okay, okay, okay.

1153
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,980
Pick your nose.

1154
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,980
I don't think I found gold yet in my nose.

1155
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,980
I'm sorry.

1156
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,980
I don't think I have any.

1157
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,980
Oh, what happened here?

1158
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,980
Examined skeleton.

1159
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,980
I found a dead body.

1160
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,980
Ooh.

1161
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,980
Let me see.

1162
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,980
Ooh.

1163
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,980
It's just sitting there. I took his loot.

1164
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,980
I looted his body.

1165
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,980
Is that big bro?

1166
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,980
Imagine.

1167
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,980
Imagine.

1168
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,980
Oh, there's flints on the other side of this.

1169
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,980
Oh, there's flints here as well.

1170
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,980
You got it? Okay, good.

1171
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,980
If you don't need it, I could just give it to you.

1172
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,980
Okay.

1173
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,980
Give me the flint and I'll make a pickaxe.

1174
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,980
And then I guess try to find

1175
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,980
a rock.

1176
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,980
I wonder if I can make a pickaxe

1177
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,980
and use it to

1178
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,980
get this thing.

1179
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,980
Yeah, I can!

1180
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,980
I can mine this rock!

1181
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:26,980
Yeah!

1182
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,980
Yeah!

1183
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,980
Let's go!

1184
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,980
Which rock, though? Hold on.

1185
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,980
Oh, no. I don't have enough.

1186
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,980
Enough what?

1187
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,980
Come here. Take all the stuff if you can.

1188
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,980
Oh, no. I don't have enough either.

1189
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,980
Fuck, let me eat.

1190
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,980
Let me pick this up.

1191
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,980
Okay, I picked it up.

1192
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,980
I picked it up.

1193
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,980
I don't think any of that was gold though, right?

1194
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,980
Okay, let's keep looking.

1195
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,980
I have

1196
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,980
knee tray, but that's not

1197
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,980
gold.

1198
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,980
Do you want to try to jump back

1199
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,980
through the

1200
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,980
through the mouth

1201
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,980
of the wormhole?

1202
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,980
Yeah, let's go.

1203
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,980
Let's see what we can find there.

1204
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,980
Because we didn't explore in that area.

1205
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,980
You know where it is.

1206
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,980
Yeah.

1207
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,980
Probably

1208
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,980
somewhere down.

1209
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,980
Yeah, somewhere down.

1210
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,980
I have a feeling it was

1211
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,980
somewhere in this direction.

1212
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,980
Because there was a giant rock

1213
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,980
right near

1214
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:40,980
Spallon.

1215
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,980
Yeah, I would love to mine.

1216
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,980
Like if you see any big rocks.

1217
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,980
Oh, the bees are down there.

1218
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,980
Oh, fuck.

1219
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,980
Whirl.

1220
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,980
Whirl.

1221
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,980
Well, I probably

1222
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,980
need a shovel.

1223
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,980
Where's the wormhole? Do you guys

1224
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,980
remember?

1225
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,980
Oh, fuck.

1226
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,980
I don't see it on the map. I'm exploring

1227
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,980
new parts of the map. Oh wait, rocks!

1228
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,980
Rocks with gold! Here!

1229
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,980
Yes! Yes! Get it!

1230
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,980
Let's go! Let's go!

1231
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,980
It looks like there's gold.

1232
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,980
We're gonna make it.

1233
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,980
The wormhole!

1234
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,980
There it is!

1235
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,980
Gold!

1236
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,980
I don't have anything.

1237
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,980
I don't have the space in my inventory.

1238
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,980
Let me eat stuff.

1239
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,980
Oh, fuck.

1240
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,980
Let me eat all of my fucking berries.

1241
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,980
Come on, bitch, eat.

1242
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,980
Eat.

1243
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,980
Give me fucking gold.

1244
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,980
Yes!

1245
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,980
Okay, okay.

1246
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,980
Okay, more flints.

1247
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,980
Hell yeah.

1248
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,980
More rocks.

1249
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,980
We can build a science machine.

1250
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,980
We can.

1251
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,980
Yeah, I'm gonna make one, okay?

1252
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,980
Okay.

1253
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,980
Should I just place it down here?

1254
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,980
Yeah, if you want to.

1255
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,980
I wonder if we can move it or not.

1256
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:12,980
I did it.

1257
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,980
Yeah!

1258
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,980
Let's go!

1259
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,980
Put the science machine where you want to stay.

1260
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,980
Well, I guess we're staying here.

1261
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,980
Yeah.

1262
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,980
I guess we're staying here.

1263
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,980
Fuck! I don't have enough space.

1264
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,980
We can make a backpack.

1265
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,980
I need two more cut grass

1266
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,980
to make a backpack.

1267
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,980
Let me see.

1268
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,980
I have five.

1269
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,980
I have five grass.

1270
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,980
Cut grass.

1271
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,980
Okay.

1272
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,980
I think I can only make one backpack.

1273
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,980
Here.

1274
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,980
Where is it?

1275
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,980
Did I not make it?

1276
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,980
Red cap.

1277
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,980
Where'd the backpack go?

1278
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,980
Oh, here it is.

1279
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,980
There it is. Take the backpack.

1280
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,980
You're sure? What about you?

1281
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,980
It's okay. It's easy to make a backpack.

1282
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,980
I just need...

1283
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,980
Oops.

1284
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,980
I just need...

1285
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,980
I can get the sticks.

1286
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,980
Okay.

1287
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,980
It's easy to make a backpack.

1288
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,980
Okay, I'm going to get some stuff.

1289
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,980
Get some more grass.

1290
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,980
I guess we need more.

1291
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,980
Me too.

1292
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,980
We're doing so much better!

1293
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,980
I know! We are!

1294
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,980
And I feel like this map

1295
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,980
that got generated

1296
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,980
is so much better too.

1297
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,980
Oh, I found more rocks I can mine.

1298
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,980
Awesome!

1299
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,980
More cold.

1300
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,980
Someone said I have a feeling

1301
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,980
something's going to blow up.

1302
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,980
No.

1303
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,980
Well, whoever said that,

1304
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,980
you feel wrong.

1305
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,980
Your feelings are wrong.

1306
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,980
Your feelings are wrong.

1307
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,980
Your feelings are wrong.

1308
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,980
Oh, shit. It's getting dark.

1309
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,980
Your feelings are invalid.

1310
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,980
Okay, whoa!

1311
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,980
Oh, shit!

1312
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,980
Where are you?

1313
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,980
Oh, dude. Oh, should I build a campfire?

1314
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,980
Yeah,

1315
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,980
I can build a campfire.

1316
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,980
No, I'm getting hurt.

1317
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,980
Okay, I'm building it right now.

1318
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,980
I'm over here.

1319
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,980
Okay, I'm on my way.

1320
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,980
I forgot that torch is existed,

1321
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,980
to be honest, but it's okay.

1322
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,980
You want to come after me?

1323
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,980
Yes.

1324
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,980
Let's just stay until night is done.

1325
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,980
And then

1326
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,980
I got hurt.

1327
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,980
My health is at 48.

1328
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,980
Oh, no.

1329
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,980
Because of the dark?

1330
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,980
Yeah.

1331
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,980
Oh, fuck.

1332
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,980
I forgot about torches existing.

1333
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,980
It's okay, it's okay.

1334
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,980
At least it's not like 5 or 6 health,

1335
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,980
like mine was.

1336
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,980
We can still work with that

1337
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,980
amount of health and probably

1338
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,980
put it back up.

1339
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,980
I believe.

1340
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,980
Someone said flowers heal.

1341
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,980
Really?

1342
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,980
They heal very little.

1343
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,980
They heal like 1 health.

1344
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,980
That's good to know though.

1345
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,980
I didn't know.

1346
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,980
Yeah, it's like 1, I think.

1347
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,980
But thank you for telling me.

1348
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,980
Yeah, okay.

1349
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,980
That's good to know.

1350
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,980
I'm going back up to mine all the stuff.

1351
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,980
Okay, I'm

1352
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,980
I'm a miner.

1353
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,980
Woo!

1354
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,980
That's mine.

1355
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,980
I need 2 more sticks.

1356
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,980
I need 2 more sticks.

1357
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,980
I can't.

1358
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,980
Bless you.

1359
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,980
Thank you.

1360
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,980
Okay, I'm going to go get more sticks

1361
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,980
so I can also make a backpack.

1362
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,980
Okay.

1363
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,980
And then we'll start making traps.

1364
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1365
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,980
I need to make another pickaxe

1366
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,980
because I'm out of mine.

1367
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,980
Okay.

1368
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,980
Thank you for all the bless yous

1369
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,980
in chat.

1370
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,980
Oops.

1371
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,980
Woo!

1372
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,980
Let's go!

1373
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,980
Let's go!

1374
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,980
I'm having so much fun now that we're

1375
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,980
getting more used to it

1376
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,980
and quite to do.

1377
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,980
There's so much stuff to mine here.

1378
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,980
Okay, this is the perfect area.

1379
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,980
We can get so much flint

1380
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,980
from this area. It's perfect for us.

1381
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,980
Yippee!

1382
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,980
I found a...

1383
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,980
I found a...

1384
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,980
I'm calling it a chicken. What is it called?

1385
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,980
A turkey?

1386
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,980
A turkey!

1387
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,980
We should kill a turkey

1388
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,980
so we can get meat from it.

1389
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,980
We'll get back to him.

1390
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,980
Where is...

1391
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,980
Oh, shoot.

1392
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,980
I'm lost.

1393
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,980
I think I'm lost.

1394
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,980
Oh, no.

1395
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,980
Are you?

1396
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,980
Don't walk too far.

1397
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,980
The science machine can be our home.

1398
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,980
Turkeys will eat all the berries?

1399
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,980
What the hell?

1400
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,980
Kill those turkeys.

1401
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,980
Those berries are ours.

1402
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,980
Why...

1403
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,980
Why is everything in this game against us?

1404
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,980
Even the butterflies are against us.

1405
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,980
Even the...

1406
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,980
I would not be surprised.

1407
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,980
Even the fucking butterflies hate us.

1408
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,980
It's so...

1409
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,980
I'm very happy about this place.

1410
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,980
There's so much to mine here.

1411
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,980
This will be very useful for us.

1412
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,980
Uh-huh.

1413
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:44,980
Flig!

1414
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,980
I have literally 16 flint.

1415
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,980
That's gotta be useful.

1416
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,980
Hopefully.

1417
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:52,980
Yeah, I hope.

1418
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,980
Oh, this bunny's got glowing eyes.

1419
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,980
Or do they all have glowing eyes?

1420
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,980
I have no idea.

1421
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,980
I'll go back.

1422
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,980
To make a backpack.

1423
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,980
Why do I have a gift?

1424
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,980
This requires more science.

1425
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,980
Oh, never mind.

1426
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,980
I'll start science and...

1427
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,980
Come on!

1428
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,980
Why is this fucking mining?

1429
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:20,980
Okay.

1430
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,980
Good.

1431
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,980
I thought you were a miner.

1432
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,980
I am!

1433
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,980
So you should be able to mine.

1434
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,980
I am!

1435
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,980
But sometimes I click it and it doesn't do anything.

1436
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,980
But it's fine.

1437
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,980
I think it's just the angle I'm doing it at.

1438
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,980
No.

1439
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,980
Yay!

1440
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,980
I have 11 gold.

1441
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,980
Nice!

1442
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,980
I have 35 rocks.

1443
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,980
17 flint.

1444
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,980
And 11

1445
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,980
golden nuggets.

1446
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,980
Let's go.

1447
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,980
I love my little miner, I see.

1448
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,980
Oh, I found ice!

1449
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,980
That's crazy.

1450
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,980
Lick it.

1451
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,980
I think we should go back to the science station.

1452
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,980
Whoa, there's like huge birds here.

1453
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,980
Really?

1454
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,980
Yeah.

1455
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,980
Can we kill them?

1456
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:20,980
I don't know, but they're big.

1457
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,980
And I'm lost.

1458
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,980
Oh, no, where are you?

1459
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,980
I'm trying to find the science station again.

1460
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,980
Oh.

1461
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,980
Oh, God.

1462
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,980
Fuck, I don't know where you are.

1463
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,980
The science station is basically...

1464
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,980
Oh, I found it.

1465
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,980
I found it.

1466
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,980
Come back to the science station.

1467
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,980
Okay.

1468
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,980
I'm on my way.

1469
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,980
And I'll build...

1470
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,980
I'll make a backpack.

1471
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:52,980
And...

1472
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,980
What else can we build at the science station?

1473
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,980
A whirley fan.

1474
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:00,980
To create some breeze.

1475
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,980
Oh, an umbrella.

1476
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,980
I almost got lost as well.

1477
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,980
Oh, there you are.

1478
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,980
Okay.

1479
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,980
Yeah, I almost got lost as well.

1480
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,980
You can build gold tools.

1481
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,980
Ooh.

1482
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,980
Wait, it's on the map of the fire pit?

1483
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,980
Or the science station?

1484
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,980
Oh, it is.

1485
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,980
Should I make a shower?

1486
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,980
A what? A shower?

1487
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,980
A shower.

1488
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,980
Oh, a shovel.

1489
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:30,980
Yeah, not a shower.

1490
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,980
We don't need a shower.

1491
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:34,980
We're fine.

1492
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,980
We don't need a shower.

1493
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,980
Okay, I'll make a shower just in case.

1494
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,980
Okay.

1495
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,980
We have something we could maybe dig.

1496
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,980
Is this rope? What can we do with rope?

1497
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,980
We found a beef.

1498
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,980
I wonder where the spiders are.

1499
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,980
Yeah, where's all the spiders you guys talked about?

1500
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,980
Yeah, where's all the spiders?

1501
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,980
Because if we find spiders, we can get like...

1502
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:04,980
spider glands and then make like

1503
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,980
healing stuff

1504
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,980
with it. Oh, really?

1505
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:10,980
Yeah.

1506
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,980
So that's like a big reason why I want to

1507
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,980
find that.

1508
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,980
I forgot about healing, to be honest here.

1509
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,980
Let me eat the petals I have.

1510
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,980
And the berries.

1511
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,980
I need to eat my carrot.

1512
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,980
Oh, speed.

1513
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,980
I'm just gonna eat freaking ice

1514
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,980
because I have nothing else to eat.

1515
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,980
Okay.

1516
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,980
Skinny core.

1517
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,980
Okay.

1518
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,980
You need legend?

1519
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,980
You want to lose weight?

1520
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,980
Just go here in the forest.

1521
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,980
Skinny legend another time.

1522
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,980
It's true.

1523
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,980
It is.

1524
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,980
Do you have twigs?

1525
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1526
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,980
Okay, yeah. Hold on.

1527
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,980
Hold on, let me bring my torch out.

1528
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,980
You need

1529
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,980
twigs,

1530
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:08,980
right? Yes.

1531
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:10,980
Okay, here.

1532
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,980
Thank you.

1533
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,980
So that way I can...

1534
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,980
Wait!

1535
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,980
We need to make traps, right?

1536
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,980
How do we make one?

1537
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,980
Oh, no, you're hungry.

1538
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,980
Oh, I am.

1539
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:26,980
I didn't notice.

1540
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:28,980
I'm gonna have some seeds.

1541
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,980
I can eat, I can eat.

1542
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,980
Hold on.

1543
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,980
My torch fucking died.

1544
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,980
What the fuck is that?

1545
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,980
What is that?

1546
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:40,980
I don't see anything.

1547
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,980
Not like this.

1548
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,980
No, no.

1549
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,980
I can't make a campfire.

1550
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,980
I can't make a campfire.

1551
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,980
No!

1552
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,980
No!

1553
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,980
No!

1554
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,980
We were doing so...

1555
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,980
No!

1556
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,980
We were doing so fucking good.

1557
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,980
What the fuck?

1558
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,980
Not like this.

1559
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,980
Did you not see that monster right next to us?

1560
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:16,980
I didn't.

1561
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:18,980
I was trying to...

1562
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,980
I was trying to...

1563
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:24,980
I was basically trying to

1564
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:26,980
make a torch,

1565
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,980
but I didn't have enough.

1566
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,980
Oh, I didn't have enough

1567
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,980
for any...

1568
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,980
I might have had enough for a torch.

1569
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,980
You gave me your sticks, right?

1570
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,980
That's probably why.

1571
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:44,980
We got three days.

1572
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,980
That's really good.

1573
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,980
Well, technically four.

1574
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,980
It's just day four.

1575
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:52,980
Well, I can hunt things.

1576
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,980
I've never been a ghost before.

1577
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,980
It's always been you that turned into a ghost.

1578
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,980
I can hunt the crow!

1579
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,980
Oh no, I can't.

1580
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,980
Do you see these monsters or is it just me?

1581
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,980
This one?

1582
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,980
Like the shadow one?

1583
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,980
Yeah, I can see those.

1584
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,980
Fuck!

1585
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,980
I could have saved you if I had enough

1586
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,980
for a fucking torch.

1587
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,980
Fuck my life.

1588
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:18,980
Wait!

1589
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,980
I'm so mad at myself right now.

1590
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:24,980
It's okay.

1591
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,980
You know why?

1592
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,980
I'm mad at myself because

1593
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:32,980
I have a fucking

1594
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:34,980
lighter that I could have fucking used.

1595
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,980
And I

1596
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,980
forgot that I have a lighter,

1597
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,980
so I could have just

1598
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,980
you know, equipped my lighter

1599
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,980
and everything would have been fine.

1600
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:46,980
But I forgot that I fucking had one.

1601
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:48,980
Fuck!

1602
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:50,980
No!

1603
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,980
We're doing so fucking good.

1604
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,980
Wait.

1605
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:56,980
I'm lowering icy sanity

1606
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,980
just by being near you.

1607
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,980
I better get a heart for Emmy.

1608
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,980
A heart?

1609
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:06,980
Okay.

1610
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:08,980
Well, I'll restart it again.

1611
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,980
Because I'm at 10 health as well.

1612
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,980
It's over.

1613
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,980
It's over.

1614
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,980
It's okay.

1615
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,980
Every time we die, we learn more

1616
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,980
and we become stronger.

1617
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,980
Real.

1618
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,980
Do you think we will be able

1619
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,980
to survive at least like

1620
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,980
10 days?

1621
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:32,980
No.

1622
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:34,980
Yeah.

1623
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:36,980
I was hoping you would be like really hopeful

1624
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,980
Hell yeah!

1625
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:40,980
It's like no more.

1626
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,980
No hope.

1627
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,980
Zero hope.

1628
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,980
No.

1629
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,980
Oh my god.

1630
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:56,980
I think we can make it to like

1631
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:58,980
six though.

1632
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:00,980
Okay, let's see.

1633
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,980
Let's take it step by step.

1634
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:04,980
Maybe once we make it to day six

1635
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,980
your confidence will boost up

1636
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:08,980
and then

1637
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:10,980
you can be like okay maybe now

1638
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,980
I believe we can make it to day ten.

1639
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,980
We'll see.

1640
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,980
You're like no.

1641
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:20,980
I don't think so.

1642
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,980
It's okay. I have enough hope

1643
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,980
for the both of us.

1644
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,980
If you don't believe in it, I will.

1645
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:32,980
Okay, thank you.

1646
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,980
Yes.

1647
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:36,980
I'm gonna become smarter

1648
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,980
and work on my reflexes

1649
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:40,980
to turn my lighter on

1650
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,980
as soon as we need it.

1651
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:44,980
So we don't die next time.

1652
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:46,980
Okay, okay, okay.

1653
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:48,980
Okay.

1654
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,980
I'm still waiting for the game to load.

1655
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,980
Okay.

1656
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:54,980
I think it might have... oh no, okay.

1657
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,980
I'll invite you.

1658
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,980
Okay.

1659
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:08,980
I'll be right back.

1660
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:10,980
I'm gonna get more water.

1661
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:12,980
Okay.

1662
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,980
I was gonna say five, but sure.

1663
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:26,980
This is a good call.

1664
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,980
Wow, Snowberry is not believing in me either.

1665
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:30,980
What the heck?

1666
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,980
Did you forget

1667
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:34,980
how powerful I am?

1668
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:36,980
I am manifesting right now

1669
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:38,980
that me and Emi

1670
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,980
survived for ten days in this game.

1671
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,980
I am a manifesting queen.

1672
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:44,980
This will happen.

1673
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,980
This will happen

1674
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:48,980
tonight.

1675
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,980
All of you non-believers.

1676
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,980
Yeah.

1677
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,980
I'm gonna prove you wrong.

1678
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,980
You're gonna see

1679
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:58,980
how powerful we are

1680
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,980
together.

1681
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,980
What do you mean?

1682
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:04,980
I'm believing right here.

1683
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,980
Okay, that's good.

1684
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:10,980
We're face-maxing.

1685
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,980
Oh my god.

1686
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:16,980
The frog not in my guard.

1687
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:18,980
Oh my god, I hate the frog.

1688
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:20,980
OOP.

1689
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,980
Like, damn.

1690
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:24,980
This is almost as powerful as the frog.

1691
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,980
It's gonna be easy.

1692
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:28,980
I really need to keep organizing

1693
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,980
my inventory in a way

1694
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,980
that I can see where my important

1695
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:34,980
items are.

1696
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,980
That's one of the stuff that keeps

1697
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,980
being a problem for me in the game.

1698
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,980
I literally had a lighter.

1699
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:42,980
I could've saved us right there

1700
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:44,980
in no moment.

1701
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:46,980
Sounds like

1702
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:48,980
punishment.

1703
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,980
The frogs make you drop

1704
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:54,980
your items. Wait, really?

1705
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,980
Like, if they attack you

1706
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,980
or if I just see them.

1707
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:02,980
She was literally a feral cop.

1708
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:04,980
How could she not make it in the wild?

1709
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:06,980
Come on guys, have some faith.

1710
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,980
Okay, exactly.

1711
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:10,980
Remember.

1712
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,980
I...

1713
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:14,980
I'm a feral cop. I can survive this.

1714
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:16,980
I went...

1715
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,980
I went through worse.

1716
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:24,980
I'm still confused.

1717
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:26,980
What does the teddy bear

1718
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:28,980
do exactly?

1719
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,980
I remember we got animated

1720
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:34,980
at a higher setting.

1721
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:36,980
That's almost good.

1722
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:38,980
I'm back.

1723
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:40,980
I'm trying to look at my skills

1724
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:42,980
and figure out if I can learn

1725
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:44,980
something useful.

1726
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,980
Oh, true.

1727
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:48,980
I didn't even look at that.

1728
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:52,980
Oh, I'm going to do that

1729
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,980
and increase my lighter's brightness.

1730
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,980
You can do that?

1731
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:58,980
Yeah.

1732
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,980
If you go to skills, you can see

1733
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:02,980
if there's a skill that you would like to learn.

1734
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:04,980
Uh-huh.

1735
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:06,980
Yeah, so that's the one I chose.

1736
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:08,980
Are you in the game yet?

1737
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,980
Yes, I'm in the game.

1738
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:12,980
Okay, I'm going to join you soon.

1739
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:16,980
Hello.

1740
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,980
Okay, I believe.

1741
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:20,980
I believe.

1742
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:26,980
Every character has a different perk tree.

1743
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:28,980
I know that.

1744
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,980
I didn't know there were skills.

1745
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,980
Sorry.

1746
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,980
It's okay.

1747
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,980
Let's see what happens if I touch a beehive.

1748
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:40,980
Oh, God.

1749
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:42,980
I don't think anything could happen.

1750
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:44,980
You think I'll die?

1751
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,980
It's buzzing with activity.

1752
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,980
That's all that happened.

1753
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,980
Nothing happened.

1754
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:54,980
See, bees are friends.

1755
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:56,980
Bee for when?

1756
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:58,980
Bumblebees are so cute.

1757
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:00,980
They're so fluffy.

1758
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:02,980
I'm scared of bumblebees.

1759
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:04,980
I'm scared of all bees.

1760
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:08,980
Look, that guy is getting attacked by spiders.

1761
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:10,980
Wait, they're spiders?

1762
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:12,980
Yeah, over there.

1763
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:14,980
On the other side of the...

1764
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,980
Oh, he's gone now.

1765
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:18,980
On the other side of the river,

1766
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:20,980
some pig man was being attacked by a bunch of spiders.

1767
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,980
If you press the other button, you punch them.

1768
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:28,980
I want to punch them.

1769
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,980
Punch the bees!

1770
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:32,980
Yeah.

1771
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:34,980
That's so cute.

1772
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:36,980
No, nothing happens.

1773
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:40,980
You can't punch the bees.

1774
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:42,980
I'm running away. I don't trust this.

1775
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,980
I have a good feeling about this.

1776
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:46,980
You don't trust me near the beehive?

1777
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:48,980
No.

1778
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,980
I don't.

1779
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:54,980
I'm trying to be as careful as I possibly can right now.

1780
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:56,980
We made so much progress.

1781
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:00,980
We did.

1782
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,980
It's okay.

1783
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:04,980
We'll be able to do it.

1784
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:06,980
What is all of this?

1785
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:08,980
Plants? Examine plants?

1786
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:12,980
It's a plant.

1787
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:14,980
And the frogs are attacking me now.

1788
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:16,980
This whole place is full of frogs.

1789
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:28,980
Oh, look!

1790
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:30,980
There's a

1791
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:32,980
a stage here?

1792
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:34,980
Something's odd here, but I can't put my finger on it.

1793
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,980
Ow!

1794
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:38,980
Where are you?

1795
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,980
I found a table with

1796
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:42,980
a plant vase

1797
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:44,980
with a flower.

1798
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:46,980
Hold on, let me see.

1799
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:48,980
I'm on my way.

1800
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:52,980
How do you get there?

1801
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:54,980
Go up.

1802
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:56,980
Okay.

1803
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:58,980
Oh, it's roses that have

1804
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:00,980
spines.

1805
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:02,980
Oh.

1806
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:04,980
Look at this.

1807
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,980
Cute.

1808
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:08,980
And then every time you pick a flower, you get hurt.

1809
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,980
Ow!

1810
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:12,980
Yeah.

1811
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:14,980
Every time you pick a flower, you get hurt.

1812
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:16,980
What is eye bone?

1813
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:18,980
That's all that happens.

1814
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:20,980
What the heck is an eye bone?

1815
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,980
Eye bone?

1816
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:24,980
What is that? Chester?

1817
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,980
Chester?

1818
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:28,980
Where did we?

1819
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,980
How did we get so lucky as to acquire a Chester?

1820
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,980
What the heck?

1821
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,980
That's so cute.

1822
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:36,980
We should totally build like our thing here

1823
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:38,980
once we find gold.

1824
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:40,980
Yeah. Wait, so can we use Chester?

1825
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:42,980
They found Chester.

1826
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:44,980
Hi, Chester.

1827
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:46,980
Is he going to follow one of us?

1828
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:48,980
Is he following you?

1829
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:50,980
Chester kind of looks like a...

1830
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:52,980
He's following you.

1831
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:54,980
No, he's just...

1832
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,980
No, he's following you.

1833
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,980
Oh.

1834
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,980
You got a Chester.

1835
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,980
He looks like a pin pal.

1836
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,980
He should be following you.

1837
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,980
He does a little bit, yeah.

1838
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:08,980
I like the pumpkin part of it.

1839
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,980
I see picked up a bone with an eye

1840
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,980
that controls Chester.

1841
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:16,980
Oh!

1842
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,980
Hold on.

1843
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:20,980
You take it because it looks like a pin pal.

1844
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:22,980
Okay. Thank you.

1845
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,980
And I have my teddy bear.

1846
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,980
My snow berry.

1847
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:28,980
Yay!

1848
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:30,980
That's so cute! I love that.

1849
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:34,980
We got our little mascots

1850
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:36,980
with us now.

1851
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:38,980
Yes.

1852
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:40,980
Cute.

1853
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:52,980
You have enough to make a campfire

1854
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:54,980
or no?

1855
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:56,980
I have a torch just in case.

1856
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:58,980
No.

1857
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:00,980
I don't,

1858
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:02,980
because I haven't found any...

1859
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:04,980
I haven't found any flint at all.

1860
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,980
Oh.

1861
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:08,980
I only have like one.

1862
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:10,980
Oh, one is enough to make a axe.

1863
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:12,980
Do you have twigs?

1864
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:14,980
Uh...

1865
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:16,980
I do have twigs.

1866
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:18,980
I have six twigs.

1867
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:20,980
You should be able to make an axe

1868
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:22,980
with one flint.

1869
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,980
Yeah, I don't have an axe.

1870
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:26,980
Okay.

1871
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,980
And then you can build a campfire

1872
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:30,980
with the wood,

1873
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:32,980
the logs.

1874
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:34,980
Okay, let me try this.

1875
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,980
Yes, please, please, absolute...

1876
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:38,980
Oh!

1877
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:40,980
You can make torches and just light trees on fire

1878
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:42,980
to have light during the night.

1879
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,980
Okay.

1880
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:46,980
Okay.

1881
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:48,980
I'm walking around.

1882
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:50,980
How did I not find a single flint?

1883
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,980
I don't know.

1884
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:54,980
That makes me kind of sad

1885
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:56,980
because we have that great area

1886
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:58,980
that has a bunch of it.

1887
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:00,980
Fuck!

1888
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:02,980
Yeah.

1889
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,980
So much.

1890
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:06,980
It was so much stuff.

1891
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:08,980
And now we have nothing.

1892
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:10,980
Now we're in the shitty fucking map again.

1893
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:14,980
What a fucked up day.

1894
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,980
It's okay.

1895
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:18,980
It's okay.

1896
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:20,980
We can make this.

1897
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:22,980
I'm sure we'll find a good area eventually.

1898
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,980
Oh, we can burn the trees for flints.

1899
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,980
Really?

1900
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:30,980
Apparently.

1901
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:32,980
Okay.

1902
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:34,980
Okay.

1903
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:36,980
Let's just burn this whole part down.

1904
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:38,980
Okay.

1905
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:40,980
Let's go.

1906
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:42,980
Yay!

1907
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:44,980
Yeah, arson.

1908
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:48,980
And now we don't even...

1909
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:50,980
We don't even need to have a campfire

1910
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:52,980
because we have all this.

1911
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,980
Yeah, exactly.

1912
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:56,980
This is our campfire.

1913
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,980
It is.

1914
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,980
Oh shit! Chester!

1915
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:02,980
Chester!

1916
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:04,980
Chester!

1917
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:06,980
No!

1918
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:12,980
Please don't tell me he's gonna die.

1919
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:14,980
Please, Chester, please!

1920
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:16,980
He dies!

1921
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:18,980
Okay, he's okay.

1922
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:20,980
Oh god.

1923
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:22,980
Oh god, okay, he's fine.

1924
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:24,980
He's okay.

1925
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:26,980
And that pin fells.

1926
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:28,980
I was just dying just now.

1927
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:30,980
And it was my fault too.

1928
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,980
Again.

1929
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:34,980
Again.

1930
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:36,980
Oh no.

1931
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:38,980
Oh, can you cut down the trees?

1932
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,980
Oh fuck!

1933
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:42,980
My torch is dying!

1934
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:44,980
My torch is on 9%.

1935
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:46,980
Okay.

1936
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:48,980
I really need to remember that I have a fucking lighter.

1937
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:50,980
I keep forgetting.

1938
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:52,980
That's fucking stupid.

1939
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:54,980
Okay, where's my damn axe?

1940
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:58,980
I was so scared for Chester.

1941
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,980
Oh, here's charcoal.

1942
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:04,980
Did you get any flint from the trees?

1943
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,980
Not really.

1944
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:08,980
All I'm getting is charcoal.

1945
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:10,980
What about you?

1946
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:12,980
I can't cut down the trees because I don't have an axe.

1947
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,980
Oh.

1948
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:16,980
What do you need again?

1949
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:18,980
Flint.

1950
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,980
You lied to me.

1951
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:22,980
I only have one.

1952
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,980
Pin fells, you lied to me and said that I can burn the trees down to get...

1953
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,980
Oh no.

1954
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:28,980
How could you?

1955
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,980
Oh.

1956
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:32,980
Only petrified trees...

1957
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:34,980
Look at my hat!

1958
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:36,980
Where'd you get that hat from?

1959
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:38,980
I...

1960
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,980
I...

1961
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:42,980
It was this...

1962
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:44,980
I saw it blunt to him.

1963
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:46,980
So I picked it up.

1964
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:48,980
Oh damn.

1965
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:50,980
Hopefully it's not haunted.

1966
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:52,980
Yeah, I hope so.

1967
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:54,980
I don't...

1968
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:58,980
It must not be good for your sanity till we're dead people's clothes, is it?

1969
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:00,980
Uh...

1970
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:02,980
My sanity is okay right now.

1971
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:04,980
Okay.

1972
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:06,980
Insight games?

1973
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:08,980
There's all the flint cut things.

1974
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,980
I know, right? There's none.

1975
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,980
Yeah, like what the fuck?

1976
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:16,980
How? Like...

1977
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:18,980
Huh?

1978
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:20,980
How are...

1979
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:22,980
There's really none.

1980
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:24,980
How are they...

1981
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:26,980
How are we supposed to get any further in the game?

1982
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:30,980
Any further in the game if there's no torches or no...

1983
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:32,980
Bad starting biome.

1984
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:34,980
I think...

1985
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:38,980
From what I'm looking at the map, we should probably go all the way up again.

1986
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,980
Okay.

1987
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:44,980
Because there's like water surrounding us and nowhere for us to like...

1988
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,980
process.

1989
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:48,980
I'm going up. Okay.

1990
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:50,980
Yeah, me too.

1991
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:54,980
Certain biomes are more likely to have a flint on the ground.

1992
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:56,980
Grassy areas or maybe rocky areas.

1993
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:58,980
There's grass everywhere.

1994
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:10,980
Okay, keep going up.

1995
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:16,980
Whoa! Oh no, I found a spider den.

1996
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,980
I should have been the spider.

1997
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:20,980
Fuck.

1998
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:22,980
Do you think if I get close to it, they'll attack me?

1999
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:24,980
I don't know.

2000
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:26,980
Probably safe to not get close to it.

2001
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:28,980
Fuck, I'm so tempted.

2002
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:30,980
I know, right? Like what's going to happen?

2003
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:32,980
I think they're just going to chase us.

2004
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:34,980
But maybe we could kill them.

2005
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:36,980
Because we would...

2006
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:38,980
I don't have a weapon.

2007
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:40,980
I don't have a weapon.

2008
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:42,980
I don't have a weapon.

2009
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:44,980
I don't have a weapon.

2010
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:46,980
I don't have a weapon.

2011
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,980
Okay, true. Let's wait until you have your own weapon.

2012
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:50,980
Okay, okay.

2013
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:54,980
Trying to find fucking flint in this shitty area.

2014
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,980
Oh, evil flower.

2015
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:04,980
I have an evil flower.

2016
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:08,980
Why can't I pick up the blue mushroom?

2017
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:10,980
Fuck. Oh, there's a question mark up there.

2018
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:12,980
What the hell? What is this?

2019
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,980
Swap clothes, mannequin.

2020
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:18,980
Did you find it?

2021
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:20,980
A mannequin?

2022
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:22,980
Yeah, look at this area.

2023
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:30,980
She's got cute clothes on.

2024
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:36,980
Oh my god, look! Look, I'm wearing her clothes.

2025
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:38,980
Oh, wait, that's kind of scary.

2026
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:40,980
What?

2027
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:42,980
Hell yeah.

2028
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:44,980
Must defend safe.

2029
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:50,980
What are they talking?

2030
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:52,980
I need to make...

2031
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:54,980
Should I set a campfire here?

2032
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:56,980
Yeah, yes, yes.

2033
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:58,980
Not yet though.

2034
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,980
But be ready to...

2035
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:02,980
I'm getting...

2036
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:04,980
Can we interact with this stuff?

2037
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:08,980
A village, there's a village.

2038
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:16,980
You can take my hat.

2039
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:18,980
Sure, I'll take the hat.

2040
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,980
Careful, careful, careful.

2041
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:24,980
They don't like us being near that thing for some reason.

2042
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:30,980
Examine stage, perform!

2043
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:32,980
It's a setup, it feels too staged.

2044
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:34,980
Oh fuck.

2045
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:40,980
Should we... Is there a village here?

2046
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:42,980
There's like more stuff.

2047
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:44,980
There's flowers?

2048
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:50,980
Oh, those are really quick.

2049
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:52,980
Oh, find a path maybe?

2050
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:58,980
Let's just keep running.

2051
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:04,980
Okay, let's maybe...

2052
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,980
I didn't know that would happen.

2053
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,980
Same.

2054
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:10,980
There's stuff on the floor, spider gland.

2055
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:12,980
Oh, they're still coming!

2056
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:14,980
Oh fuck.

2057
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,980
Maybe if I put a campfire, it'll make them go away?

2058
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:18,980
No.

2059
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:20,980
They just want to chew on the campfire.

2060
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:22,980
Fuck.

2061
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:24,980
Fuck.

2062
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:26,980
Wait, I think we're good now.

2063
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:28,980
Are we?

2064
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:30,980
No, no, no, no.

2065
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:32,980
Fuck, I don't have my weapons.

2066
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:36,980
Oh!

2067
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:38,980
No, no!

2068
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:40,980
No, I got a spider in my ass too, no.

2069
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:42,980
No, I got multiple spiders in my ass.

2070
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:48,980
And I don't have my weapons.

2071
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,980
Wait, why do I have an axe?

2072
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:52,980
Did you give me your axe?

2073
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:54,980
Oh wait, they're eating the spider.

2074
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:56,980
They're fighting against each other.

2075
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:58,980
They're fighting against each other.

2076
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,980
The spider and the flower thing?

2077
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:02,980
They're fighting.

2078
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,980
Thank god.

2079
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:06,980
Who's winning?

2080
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,980
I don't know.

2081
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:10,980
What's that on the floor?

2082
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:12,980
Crack-crack-dull mask.

2083
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:18,980
Oh look, now we're matching!

2084
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:20,980
Cute!

2085
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:26,980
Oh my god.

2086
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:28,980
Okay.

2087
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,980
They're eating Chester?

2088
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:32,980
Wait, but Chester's okay.

2089
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:34,980
Okay.

2090
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:40,980
I want to go back to that place though.

2091
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,980
Me too.

2092
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:44,980
Careful, there's spiders.

2093
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:46,980
Oh fuck.

2094
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:48,980
Oh fuck.

2095
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:54,980
What the fuck is that?

2096
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,980
What the fuck is that?

2097
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:04,980
Why are there so many jump scares in this game?

2098
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,980
Oh my god.

2099
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:10,980
Why are there so many?

2100
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,980
Come on, I just want it to be like again.

2101
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:14,980
Come on!

2102
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,980
Come back, son.

2103
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:18,980
You can use that to break down trees for logs?

2104
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:22,980
Oh, you're getting the logs.

2105
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:24,980
Oh!

2106
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:28,980
Okay.

2107
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:30,980
I'm going to use my lighter.

2108
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:32,980
Okay.

2109
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:38,980
That's helpful.

2110
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:42,980
Do we?

2111
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:44,980
Oh fuck.

2112
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:46,980
Oh no!

2113
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:48,980
Go away!

2114
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:50,980
We can use it to break more trees, I guess.

2115
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:54,980
Oh fuck!

2116
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:56,980
Come over here, break these trees down for us.

2117
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:58,980
Wait, can it break down this?

2118
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:00,980
Oh fuck!

2119
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:02,980
It got trampled!

2120
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:04,980
It's okay.

2121
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:06,980
I wanted to break down the spiders.

2122
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:10,980
Break down the spiders stuff.

2123
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:12,980
Okay, how?

2124
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:14,980
I don't think it's able to.

2125
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:16,980
Is it able to?

2126
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:18,980
Maybe.

2127
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:20,980
I'm not sure.

2128
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:22,980
Careful when you walk on the webs.

2129
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:24,980
The spiders come out.

2130
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:26,980
Oh wait.

2131
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:28,980
Is it silk?

2132
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:30,980
Got it.

2133
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:32,980
Are all the spiders dead?

2134
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:34,980
I can light the spider den on fire!

2135
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:36,980
Yes!

2136
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:38,980
Perfect!

2137
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:40,980
I really need your fire.

2138
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:42,980
I can light the pig house on fire too!

2139
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:48,980
Oh man.

2140
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:50,980
This was a rough night.

2141
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:52,980
It was, but it was a fun night.

2142
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:54,980
That thing is still walking around too.

2143
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:56,980
Oh god.

2144
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:58,980
I have like...

2145
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:06,980
There's monster meat.

2146
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:10,980
Oh, you can use spider glands to heal yourself.

2147
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:14,980
Yeah.

2148
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:16,980
There's a monster meat.

2149
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:18,980
Oh fuck.

2150
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:20,980
What is this on the four ashes?

2151
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:22,980
Ashes?

2152
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:24,980
There's an interesting thing over here.

2153
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:26,980
Okay.

2154
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:28,980
Oh god, not this guy again.

2155
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:30,980
It's okay.

2156
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:32,980
He's friendly.

2157
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:34,980
No, it says it's nasty.

2158
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:36,980
I think I need to cool it.

2159
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:40,980
Don't break the den.

2160
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:42,980
Don't burn it.

2161
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:44,980
Oh fuck.

2162
01:27:44,980 --> 01:27:46,980
It's okay, it's okay.

2163
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:48,980
I just wanted to pick up the stuff he has.

2164
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:50,980
He's really easy to avoid, it's okay.

2165
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:52,980
I'll put some stuff in Chester.

2166
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:54,980
Oh.

2167
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:56,980
I got a backpack.

2168
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:58,980
Okay, that's good too.

2169
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:00,980
Wait, how do you have a backpack?

2170
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:02,980
Ah, because I found one laying here.

2171
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:04,980
Oh, you found a laying.

2172
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:06,980
I guess you could use Chester as your backpack.

2173
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:08,980
Yeah, I can.

2174
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:10,980
So I'm guessing this is the village.

2175
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:12,980
Ah, so...

2176
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,980
How do you cook meat, by the way?

2177
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:16,980
You have to cook it on the campfire.

2178
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:20,980
You back off, that's my space.

2179
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:24,980
I don't like it when you enter their village, I guess.

2180
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:28,980
Willow is immune to fire damage and overheat slowly.

2181
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:30,980
Yes, yes.

2182
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:32,980
I wonder how much meat we would get

2183
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:34,980
if we both attacked one of the pigs.

2184
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:36,980
Do you want to?

2185
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:38,980
I want to try,

2186
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,980
but I'm also scared because there's a lot of them.

2187
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:44,980
Oh, I do have an axe.

2188
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:46,980
Do you think they'll all come running after us

2189
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:48,980
if we attack one?

2190
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:50,980
I mean, definitely.

2191
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:52,980
They're running after us even like

2192
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:54,980
we don't do anything to them.

2193
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:56,980
Oh, do you think if we give them meat,

2194
01:28:56,980 --> 01:28:58,980
they'll be friendly?

2195
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:00,980
I don't know.

2196
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:04,980
Why is this one not attacking?

2197
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:06,980
I don't think I'll stay away.

2198
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:08,980
I don't know.

2199
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:10,980
What if I give them meat?

2200
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:12,980
Time for food, meat hungry.

2201
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:14,980
Too close.

2202
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:18,980
You have meat, you're not pig.

2203
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:20,980
You're not pig.

2204
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:22,980
Well, damn.

2205
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:24,980
Let me try killing this frog.

2206
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:28,980
Come here, frog.

2207
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:32,980
I want to try giving them meat

2208
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:34,980
and seeing what happens.

2209
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:36,980
I gave to one of them meat.

2210
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:40,980
Oh, that's probably why they're not attacking anymore.

2211
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:44,980
Okay.

2212
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:46,980
Home time.

2213
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:48,980
Scary.

2214
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:50,980
What happened to the tree?

2215
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:56,980
Can we go inside one of their houses?

2216
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:58,980
I don't know.

2217
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:00,980
Me tree berries.

2218
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:02,980
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

2219
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:04,980
Okay, where is my...

2220
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:06,980
Oh, no, this guy is stuck.

2221
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:10,980
He can't go inside a house.

2222
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:14,980
There's a guy over here.

2223
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:16,980
Oh, no.

2224
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:18,980
I mean, now it seems okay.

2225
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:20,980
It's just like Minecraft villagers.

2226
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:24,980
Bro, just walk inside the house.

2227
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:26,980
Why are you...

2228
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:28,980
He's stupid. He doesn't know what he's doing.

2229
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:30,980
Okay.

2230
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:32,980
There's this thing.

2231
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:34,980
Oh, my God, they have a head on a stick.

2232
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:36,980
Wait, what?

2233
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:38,980
They have a head on a stick

2234
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:40,980
in the village.

2235
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:42,980
Wait, let me see.

2236
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:44,980
Look at it.

2237
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:46,980
Oh.

2238
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:48,980
That's what you get for being so stinky.

2239
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:50,980
What is a worm for?

2240
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:52,980
A worm.

2241
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:54,980
Examine headstone.

2242
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:56,980
It says calm on in.

2243
01:30:56,980 --> 01:30:58,980
Okay.

2244
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:00,980
In the fucking grave.

2245
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:02,980
In the grave? Probably.

2246
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:04,980
It's inviting us to die, probably.

2247
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:06,980
It says I was underground

2248
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:08,980
before it was a thing.

2249
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:10,980
What does that supposed to mean?

2250
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:16,980
Before it was a thing.

2251
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:18,980
I wanted to die before it was cool.

2252
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:22,980
Oh, my God.

2253
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:28,980
Let's...

2254
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:30,980
Let's keep exploring

2255
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:32,980
because I literally haven't found

2256
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:34,980
a single piece of flint yet.

2257
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:36,980
Right? How do I get...

2258
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:38,980
How do I make a fucking...

2259
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:40,980
Yeah, fucking flint.

2260
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:42,980
I'm baffled that there's still no fucking flint.

2261
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:44,980
Like, how does that happen?

2262
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:46,980
I really need food.

2263
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,980
Meat.

2264
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:52,980
Nah, I'm okay on food right now.

2265
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:54,980
How much is your hunger?

2266
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:56,980
It says 69%.

2267
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:00,980
Yeah, you should...

2268
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:04,980
You should find the light green area

2269
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:06,980
for flint or rock area.

2270
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:08,980
Okay.

2271
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,980
Let me look at the map.

2272
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:14,980
Damn it, I really should have been spider person.

2273
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:16,980
Maybe if we die again,

2274
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:18,980
you could try that.

2275
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:20,980
Yeah, next time.

2276
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:22,980
I think if we go right...

2277
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:24,980
I think if we go right,

2278
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:26,980
I see rocky area.

2279
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:30,980
So, let's keep going

2280
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:32,980
and then when it gets dark, we can set up a campfire.

2281
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:34,980
Okay.

2282
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:36,980
You have the tools to make one, right?

2283
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:38,980
Yeah, I do.

2284
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:40,980
Oh, wait, I want to get this musher.

2285
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:42,980
Okay.

2286
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:44,980
Just for fun.

2287
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:46,980
Spiders are your friend.

2288
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:48,980
Campfire time, campfire time.

2289
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,980
Okay, come on.

2290
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:52,980
Okay.

2291
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:54,980
Oh, thank God.

2292
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:56,980
If spiders are friends with you,

2293
01:32:56,980 --> 01:32:58,980
it doesn't mean they're...

2294
01:32:58,980 --> 01:33:00,980
Wait, if spiders are friends with you,

2295
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:02,980
it doesn't mean they're friends with your friend.

2296
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:04,980
Oh!

2297
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:06,980
What?

2298
01:33:06,980 --> 01:33:08,980
So, they would still attack Icy?

2299
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:12,980
Really?

2300
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:14,980
Oh, no.

2301
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:16,980
The poor guy.

2302
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:18,980
His name is Eggie.

2303
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:20,980
Is that all?

2304
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:22,980
Dude, I think Eggie is going to die.

2305
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:24,980
Why?

2306
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:26,980
He's all alone.

2307
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:28,980
Is he hungry?

2308
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:30,980
Eggie.

2309
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:32,980
Oh, I shouldn't go there.

2310
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:36,980
I don't know.

2311
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:38,980
He's all alone over there.

2312
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:44,980
Okay, there we go.

2313
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:46,980
That was fast.

2314
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:48,980
What?

2315
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:50,980
Ah, fuck any of the pickaxes.

2316
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:52,980
So fucking bad.

2317
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:54,980
Like, please, give me a fucking flint.

2318
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:56,980
I know.

2319
01:33:56,980 --> 01:33:58,980
Okay, I'm still going down this way.

2320
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:00,980
Following the path.

2321
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:02,980
Okay, I'll go with you.

2322
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:04,980
Okay.

2323
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:06,980
At least I thought this dark area was rock.

2324
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:10,980
But maybe it's not?

2325
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:14,980
Oh, maybe this isn't rock.

2326
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:16,980
Whoa, did you see that coming out of the ground?

2327
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:18,980
Wet tentacles?

2328
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:20,980
What the fuck?

2329
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:22,980
Oh, no.

2330
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:24,980
Okay, let's go.

2331
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:26,980
Wow.

2332
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:30,980
I don't trust you.

2333
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:32,980
Wow.

2334
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:36,980
I don't think we'll get any...

2335
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:40,980
I don't think we'll get flint here,

2336
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:42,980
but I thought that was cool.

2337
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:46,980
Okay.

2338
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:48,980
I am...

2339
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:50,980
Like, how is there no flint still,

2340
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:52,980
like, this entire time?

2341
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:54,980
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

2342
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:56,980
Okay.

2343
01:34:56,980 --> 01:34:58,980
They said it's the most hostile area of the game,

2344
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:00,980
so we should avoid it.

2345
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:02,980
Oh, look, another one.

2346
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:06,980
This time it's got the king mask.

2347
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:08,980
Ooh.

2348
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:10,980
And a king costume.

2349
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:12,980
And then I absolutely should not

2350
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:14,980
attack the flowers.

2351
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:24,980
Now I'm the king.

2352
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:32,980
Oh, wait a minute.

2353
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:34,980
Safe king.

2354
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,980
I protect king.

2355
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:38,980
Wait a minute.

2356
01:35:38,980 --> 01:36:02,420
What he hit me in one hit he killed me in one oh we can just reset the world

2357
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:09,740
that's helpful yeah we should just die together huh yeah next time we can just

2358
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:19,780
die together and that's easier reset now do it yeah that's the first we've got

2359
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:32,380
two so far I'm aiming for 10 I'm aiming for 10 I'm aiming for six and you could

2360
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:39,980
be at the spider now as well yeah I wanted to try that I want to see if

2361
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:48,060

2362
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:51,660
in the skill set like you click the character and then click skill set on

2363
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:54,380
the bottom right

2364

does anyone know how to use Bernie like my teddy bear or like what does he do

2365

2390
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:54,940
in the water there's lots of things in the water I wonder if there's a way to like walk into the

2391
01:42:54,940 --> 01:43:19,900
water like if there's anything we can craft or build we need a bolt you found it there's

2393
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:55,940
what I need a few logs okay okay but it says use a science machine to build a prototype

2394
01:43:55,940 --> 01:44:02,580
that's okay we can do that I can I have enough for a science mission I think just need more wood

2395
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:12,740
is it harder for me to cut down trees because I'm a spider or something I've been having so

2396
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:23,380
much trouble cutting down trees I got a science machine okay I'm gonna make our base here and I'm

interesting they don't do anything I guess they're just there

2491
02:03:14,380 --> 02:03:21,100
is this supposed to be some sort of lore I wonder if it's like lore some kind of puzzle even

2492
02:03:22,140 --> 02:03:28,700
but I'm too stupid for puzzles so I wouldn't fucking get it all I'm too stupid for puzzles and the lore

2493
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:32,140
oh there's no sticks though

02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:38,460
oh I hate the sound of the bees

2495
02:03:44,460 --> 02:03:48,700
lore for boss fight oh there's boss fights

2496
02:03:50,380 --> 02:03:55,020
we're dying from like the bare minimum and they put boss boss fights in this game

2497
02:03:55,660 --> 02:04:04,220
I thought I thought we were seeing the bosses already I thought we were meeting the bosses

2498
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:11,420
oh there's sticks get those ones that's the only I'm kind of concerned because they didn't find

2499
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:21,340
like any food yet oh never mind there's a carrot here okay I'm concerned because I can't find sticks

2505
02:05:08,300 --> 02:05:13,020
what the fuck and that's how bad we are is there a final boss

2506
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:18,380

02:11:11,180 --> 02:11:17,660
I don't have an axe oh no I do have an axe never mind I got an axe I'll save you please kill the

2561
02:11:17,660 --> 02:11:22,940

2562
02:11:27,820 --> 02:11:34,940
I hate how many bees are here oh my god I cannot enjoy anything in this area what the fuck

2563
02:11:35,820 --> 02:11:41,500
oh okay it shows on the map where the is there a way to like get the

2564
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:49,740
there there's no way that they expect us to walk every statue back to the that that statue um

2565
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:59,580
like formation right I wonder if like maybe you're supposed to like build something to like

2566
02:11:59,580 --> 02:12:05,580
carry it or something yeah that's why there's so many frogs in here what the there is a lot

2567
02:12:06,300 --> 02:12:14,140
like yeah because there's blank spaces so they probably expect you to bring those statues back

2568
02:12:14,940 --> 02:12:18,700
oh wait and then it's probably a boss battle it'll probably spawn a boss

2569
02:12:19,580 --> 02:12:30,780
yeah we are not ready for a boss a boss battle a boss battle a boss battle

2570
02:12:31,660 --> 02:12:39,580
oh look there's paper on the floor oh there's other stuff on the floor can I eat the rot

2571
02:12:40,620 --> 02:12:42,220
okay yeah I eat the rot ew

2572
02:12:45,980 --> 02:12:53,980
we can cook stuff in here oh we can cook stuff in here that's awesome that's so helpful cook

2574
02:13:02,060 --> 02:13:06,300

2578
02:13:36,540 --> 02:13:45,980
cook I thought so too um I thought so too um um

2579
02:13:54,620 --> 02:14:01,500
you're supposed to do it like that's the logical thing to do like light the pot right like cool

2580
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:10,140
I know I agree I thought the same thing wait why did I get a fist full of jam now okay

2581
02:14:12,540 --> 02:14:15,180
oopsies the crackpot got cooked

2582
02:14:16,300 --> 02:14:26,140
oh my god oh shit my my berries went spoiled I feel so bad about what the fuck I'm gonna just leave

2583
02:14:26,140 --> 02:14:32,460
I really thought I'm doing something you really thought you ate yeah I really thought I ate with

2584
02:14:33,660 --> 02:14:41,740
I was like yeah I know what I'm doing let me cook and then I just cook the entire pot itself

2585
02:14:41,740 --> 02:14:49,660
and burn it there's nothing fucking there's nothing like it left I should not be cooking

2586
02:14:49,660 --> 02:14:56,460
okay and then light anything on fire that's okay we'll find we'll find another one I'm sure

2587
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:05,900
we'll make one we'll make one we just need um oh there's a turkey where

2588
02:15:08,060 --> 02:15:11,500
I think he hit somewhere oh they can hide in the berry bushes

2589
02:15:12,460 --> 02:15:14,860
it won't let me examine the berry bush

2590
02:15:19,020 --> 02:15:24,540
this bush is working hard on the next batch wait I wonder if I set it on fire if he will come out

02:15:25,580 --> 02:15:30,860
do you think that would work try okay let me smell it

2592
02:15:34,140 --> 02:15:40,300
no I guess not uh I guess he just he went somewhere else teleported somewhere never mind

2593
02:15:41,500 --> 02:15:44,300
I guess

2594
02:15:46,140 --> 02:15:53,980
oh my inventory is oh oh fuck I don't feel safe that fire is gonna go out um

2595

2769
02:39:51,180 --> 02:39:59,420
it to mimosa during our stream and for some reason my computer saved it I sent it to her

2770
02:39:59,420 --> 02:40:07,740
it's not my clot but it's so it's I was telling her a story about clots and now it's like saved to

2771
02:40:07,740 --> 02:40:21,020
my um it's saved to my recommended oh my god you know what that reminds me of I was I was crawling

2772
02:40:21,100 --> 02:40:26,860
through twitter today and and I saw an ice cream that looked like a period

2773
02:40:35,180 --> 02:40:41,980
untwitted yeah yeah I'm scrolling through like that for you and I'm like okay why are you giving

2774
02:40:41,980 --> 02:40:48,780
me ice cream that looks like a period pad why is that for me you gotta show that to me I need to

2775
02:40:49,580 --> 02:40:56,300
but I don't know if I will is it by magnum I don't know is it because I looked it up and I found

2776
02:40:56,300 --> 02:41:01,900
one by magnum really it's like it's like white and then it has like a lot of like red in the middle

2777
02:41:06,460 --> 02:41:13,500
yeah yeah it's euphoria and chill is like the name ladies why not treat yourself to a sanitary

2778
02:41:13,500 --> 02:41:29,180
pad flavored ice cream I don't think they realized it yeah I think they should uh

2779
02:41:30,220 --> 02:41:38,460
reconsider the design of that ice cream and redo it some other way because that looks really bad

2780
02:41:38,460 --> 02:41:46,940
that does not look appetizing to me I mean it looks like a clean pad at least

2781
02:41:48,860 --> 02:41:55,420
so you can you can you can snack on a clean pad instead of a bloody one like

2782
02:41:58,620 --> 02:42:06,700
what is eating eat me that this is your idea of a snack well it's ice cream it's still ice cream

2783
02:42:06,940 --> 02:42:09,660
it just looks like a pad

2784
02:42:13,180 --> 02:42:19,820
I feel like you have worse food combinations than me no I don't are you kidding me I don't

2785
02:42:19,820 --> 02:42:25,820
do those food combinations anymore I used to do that when I was a child but you posted a weird

2786
02:42:25,820 --> 02:42:31,900
picture on Twitter like right near debut of like some really strange food combination

2787
02:42:32,780 --> 02:42:38,940
oh what that was that was like that was baked chicken and mashed potatoes

2788
02:42:40,060 --> 02:42:44,700
hold on and I and I made and I used ketchup because I wanted to draw a heart with it

2789
02:42:45,260 --> 02:42:52,380
you put ketchup in mashed potatoes only to make that heart I I tried to like make a heart to make

2790
02:42:52,380 --> 02:42:59,180
it super cute and be like here here's your food snowberry but everyone made fun of my cooking

2791
02:42:59,980 --> 02:43:07,500
because they put ketchup in mashed potatoes for the art for the heart

2792
02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:15,660
but you could have used gravy or did you not have gravy I mean how would I draw a heart with a

2793
02:43:15,660 --> 02:43:27,580
gravy that doesn't make sense to me okay but normally I don't put ketchup on my mashed potatoes

2794
02:43:27,660 --> 02:43:33,820
okay it was strictly it was strictly so I can draw a heart on the mashed potatoes but it didn't

2795
02:43:33,820 --> 02:43:41,420
it ended up looking like not even a heart so yeah don't let Icy cook

2796
02:43:45,580 --> 02:43:52,060
she'll put mad she'll put ketchup in your mashed potatoes to show my love to show her love

2797
02:43:52,940 --> 02:44:02,700
