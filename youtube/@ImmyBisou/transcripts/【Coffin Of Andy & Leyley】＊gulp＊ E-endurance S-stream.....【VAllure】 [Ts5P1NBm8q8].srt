how is your favorite ginger?

12
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,660
I still can't believe I'm ginger man

13
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,660
I don't look ginger

14
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,660
I just look blonde to me

15
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,660
I'll try making my 2.0 look more ginger

16
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,660
Whenever you wake up this morning

17
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,660
we don't make the rose here, yeah

18
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,660
You fall asleep when I fall asleep

19
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,660
My morning is your morning

20
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,660
I hit my mic

21
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,660
It's the freckles

22
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,660
Yeah, but gingers also have ginger hair

23
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,660
And I feel like mine is blonde

24
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,660
Not ginger, you know

25
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,660
Ginger denial

26
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,660
I guess, yeah, I'm in denial

27
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,660
I hope you can recover soon

28
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,660
Me too, but it's okay

29
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,660
Even if I don't recover in a couple weeks

30
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,660
I'm going on vacation soon

31
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,660
Like actually

32
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,660
So I can take that time

33
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,660
To recover too

34
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,660
Because um

35
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,660
No don't worry, I went last year

36
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,660
I'm going to be going every year

37
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,660
This is a planned vacation that I go on every year

38
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,660
So it's inevitable

39
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,660
I'm going to be going next year

40
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,660
And the year before that

41
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,660
Because this is a planned vacation that I go on every year

42
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,660
So yeah, I'm going on vacation soon

43
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,660
So I can use that time to recover

44
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,660
If um

45
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,660
If for some reason the cough lasts a really long time

46
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,660
Yeah

47
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,660
It won't be long, don't worry

48
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,660
It won't be a long vacation

49
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,660
Right?

50
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,660
Did you have a happy sleep? I did, it was so good

51
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,660
You don't fucking get it

52
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,660
When I was like

53
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,660
Setting my timer

54
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,660
To wake up at 11, I was like

55
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,660
I'm not going to make it

56
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,660
I'm not going to make it

57
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,660
I'm not going to make it

58
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,660
And I didn't make it

59
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,660
Here I am, wait

60
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,660
Right, I know my voice is really croaky right now

61
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,660
It's because I just woke up

62
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,660
Hope you have fun there

63
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,660
Okay, let me show you something

64
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,660
Let me show you

65
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,660
Oh

66
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,660
Okay

67
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,660
Right

68
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,660
Oh, that's not the right thing

69
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,660
Right, so

70
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,660
Here's our screen, right?

71
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,660
Let me explain the rules

72
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,660
Okay, let me explain the rules

73
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,660
So, here's our rules

74
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
Any tip amount

75
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,660
Is a sip of water?

76
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,660
Hold on

77
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,660
Let me make sure my tips actually work

78
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,660
Because I'm not sure they do

79
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,660
I'm not sure that they do

80
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,660
And also we're doing our monetization stream

81
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,660
Tomorrow

82
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,660
Because I got monetized

83
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,660
I'm here

84
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,660
Tip event custom

85
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,660
Right

86
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,660
Well

87
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,660
It's supposed to

88
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,660
It's supposed to have text to speech

89
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,660
Um

90
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,660
Sip sip sip get hydrate get hydrate

91
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,660
Why doesn't it have text to speech?

92
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,660
Oh, I already have to sip

93
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,660
Was that? Fuck, okay

94
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,660
Um

00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,660
Oh, it's because I muted it

96
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,660
Okay, there we go

97
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,660
Let me try that again just to make sure

98
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,660
Okay

99
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,660
Also, I did sip

100
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,660
Thank you for the dono

101
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,660
I did sip, I did

102
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,660
Okay, let's try that again

103
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,660
Are you gay?

104
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,660
Why are you acting so gay?

105
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,660
Okay, why am I not hearing it?

107
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,660
Are you gay?

108
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,660
Why are you acting so gay?

109
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,660
To drink water, not just me

110
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,660
Okay

There, I drink

112
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,660
Oh, for some reason my alerts

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,660
Aren't

114
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
Doing text to speech

115
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,660
Let me try something

116
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,660
Alerts

117
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,660
Control via OBS, no

00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,660

119
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,660

How about that?

123
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,660
Are you gay?

124
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,660
There we go

125
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,660
Why are you acting so gay?

126
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,660
Penis, penis, penis, penis

127
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,660
There we go

128
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,660
Right, I realize that our alerts

129
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,660
Are covering the rules

130
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,660
So I'll move them

131
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,660
$1 for one sip, it's any amount

132
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,660
For one sip

133
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,660
A sip is any amount

134
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,660
Okay

135
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,660
Where the fuck are my rules?

136
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,660
Okay, so continuing on

137
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,660
Energy levels goes as following

138
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,660
So I will have my energy down here

139
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,660
Are you gay?

140
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,660
Why are you acting so gay?

141
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,660
Hi Emmy, hydration check

142
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,660
Thank you for the $1

143
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,660
Okay, hydration check

144
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,660
Okay there

145
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,660
Right

146
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,660
Yeah, energy goes as following

147
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,660
So there's good as you can see down there

148
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,660
And then there's alright

149
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,660
And then there's

150
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,660
Are you sick? Yes I am sick

151
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
There's alright

152
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,660
And then there's eek

153
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,660
And then there's low

154
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,660
And then there's very low

155
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,660
And then there's no more

156
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,660
And it says please please please please please

157
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,660
Let me end, okay?

158
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,660
That's how the energy levels go

159
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,660
And then

160
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,660
Once energy is very low

161
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,660
Sorry, once energy is low

162
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,660
I will start making polls to ask

163
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,660
If I can end stream

164
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,660
I can only...

165
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,660
Are you gay?

166
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,660
This is going to get interesting

167
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,660
Also congrats on monetization

168
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,660
Thank you

169
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,660
For the $20

170
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,660
There

171
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,660
And thank you, thank you

172
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,660
Very happy that we got monetized

173
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,660
I'm sorry if I don't

174
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,660
Some of the other girls are so thankful

175
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,660
On Twitter they're giving such heartfelt messages

176
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,660
And I'm like damn

177
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,660
I probably seem like an asshole

178
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,660
Why are you so gay?

179
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,660
I can't talk right now

180
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,660
I'm making piss

181
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
Thank you for the $420

182
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
I hope you can hear me drink

183
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,660
But I am thankful

184
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,660
I'm just not like

185
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
I guess I'm just not as hyped cause it's like

186
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,660
I sound like such an asshole

187
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,660
Cause it's like

188
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,660
Of course we got monetized

189
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,660
That's the whole point of this

190
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,660
But I thank you for watching

191
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,660
And helping us get there

192
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,660
You know

193
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,660
So I'm happy that

194
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,660
You're the one watching

195
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,660
And helping us get monetized

196
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,660
But um

197
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,660
I've already been monetized before

198
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,660
So it's not like a huge accomplishment for me

199
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,660
If that doesn't make me sound like a bitch

200
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
I feel like it does

201
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,660
But yeah

202
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,660
You sound good okay

203
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,660
But you know

204
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,660
It's a big goal

205
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,660
And I'm happy that you helped us get there

206
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,660
Right

207
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,660
Thank you for the headpats too

208
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,660
Gay

209
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,660
Why are you acting so gay?

210
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,660
Yippee

211
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,660
Another sip

212
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
Man

213
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,660
Okay

214
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,660
Everyone takes it in differently

215
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,660
I just feel like compared to the other girls

216
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,660
I'm like underwhelming

217
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,660
Cause I'm like

218
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,660
Well I sure hope we got monetized

219
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,660
But yeah

220
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,660
Thank you

221
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,660
Okay um right

222
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,660
Let me show you the game

223
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,660
And also

224
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,660
Fuck

225
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,660
Um

226
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,660
There are branching paths in this part of the game

227
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,660
This is gonna need more than one save file

228
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,660
Well

229
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,660
We only want one path

230
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,660
I'm only going one path

231
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,660
I'm not playing multiple endings

232
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,660
Membership went Saturday

233
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,660
So tomorrow

234
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,660
Right um

235
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,660
Also I

236
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,660
I'm not gonna explicitly say it

237
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,660
But I'm gonna explicitly say it now

238
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,660
I started

239
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660
Oh shit is this a game built on chromium

240
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,660
No

241
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,660
I started

242
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,660
This stream having to piss

243
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,660
Okay I woke up

244
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,660
From sleeping

245
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,660
And I had to go

246
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,660
And you know what I didn't do? I didn't go

247
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,660
You're welcome

248
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,660
Saving a chest for you

249
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,660
9 out of 10

250
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,660
9 out of 10

251
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,660
Why are you acting so gay

252
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,660
I love you too

253
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,660
Thank you for the 420

254
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660
Okay

255
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,660
Keep your mic on when you go

256
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,660
That's the thing I'm not fucking going

257
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,660
Until you tell me to end the stream

258
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,660
I'm not going

259
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,660
That's the plan of the endurance stream

260
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,660
So yeah

261
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,660
Okay let me set up here

262
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,660
Get all comfy

263
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,660
There won't be ending simple as

264
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,660
What do you mean there won't be an ending

265
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,660
We are ending it's ending eventually

266
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,660
You're letting me end please let me end eventually

267
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,660
I hope you get a mat ready

268
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,660
Shut up

269
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,660
Please I need to end eventually

270
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,660
Gay

271
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,660
Why are you acting so gay

272
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,660
Testing testing

273
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,660
It works I'll set up for you

274
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,660
Thank you for the 10 dollars

275
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,660
Just make sure you don't hurt yourself

276
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,660
I won't

277
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,660
I would not lie to you

278
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,660
I can't

279
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,660
Not that I've tried before or anything

280
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,660
But I can't

281
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,660
We will never let you leave

282
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,660
I think you will

283
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,660
I think if I beg hard enough you will

284
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,660
You'll feel bad for me

285
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,660
We need a safe word

286
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,660
I was going to say a slur as our safe word

287
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,660
But then I realized that I probably shouldn't

288
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,660
Um

289
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,660
Let's use the word

290
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,660
Rats

291
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660
Rats is our safe word

292
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,660
Anyways let's continue

293
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,660
Our game

294
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,660
Okay we were in the park

295
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,660
What were we doing in the park

296
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,660
Rats

297
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,660
Rats

298
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,660
Where are the rats

299
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,660
Yes it's a very fitting safe word

300
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,660
Ice cream stand

301
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,660
Only

302
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660
Only operates during the height of summer season

303
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,660
Oh

304
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,660
This can't be the right place

305
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660
Look how nice everything is

306
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,660
No it's gotta be

307
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,660
She did sound happy when she talked about their new place too

308
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,660
What's the last name anyways

309
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,660
What do you mean what's the last name

310
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,660
The name plates on the doors

311
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,660
Gay? Why are you acting so gay

312
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,660
I already feel bad

313
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,660
Yet here I go donating

314
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,660
Thank you for the 15 dollars

315
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,660
I hope you can hear me sipping

316
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,660
Right

317
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,660
The name plates on the door

318
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,660
Did they go with dad's name or mom's

319
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,660
Dad's name right

320
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,660
Why would they change that at this point

321
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,660
I don't know to throw us off

322
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,660
You really make it sound like they don't want us to find them

323
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,660
Just a feeling I got

324
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,660
Or whatever

325
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,660
Let's find the house of Mr. and Mrs. Graves

326
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,660
Going to the parent's house right

327
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,660
Did you skip an episode

328
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,660
I played a little

329
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,660
At the end of a stream

330
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,660
Grayson

331
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,660
So if you missed one of the streams

332
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,660
I think it was during the

333
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,660
Blind stream

334
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,660
Where I played a little

335
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,660
Ugly Van McHidious

336
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,660
Are you gay

337
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
Why are you acting so gay

338
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,660
It's okay Emmy we understand never feel bad

339
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,660
We are happy and proud that you made it to this point

340
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,660
I'm really excited for this stream

341
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
Are you gay

342
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,660
Why are you acting so gay

343
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,660
It's peak

344
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,660
Crying face

345
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,660
Crying face

346
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,660
I guess if twice for that one

347
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,660
Andy and Layla are going to be the next

348
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,660
Mr. and Mr. Graves

349
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,660
Cause we're going to make them fuck

350
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,660
Don't just knock

351
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,660
Uh oh no one comes

352
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,660
Alright whatever

353
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,660
Let's just find a way in

354
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,660
I don't know how do we get in

355
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,660
Break in

356
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,660
Just break in

357
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,660
Are you gay

358
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,660
Why are you acting so gay

359
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,660
We can hear don't worry

360
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,660
Thank you for the tip

361
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,660
Okay that's good that you can hear

362
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,660
What are they doing

363
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,660
They're bringing into the house

364
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,660
Also I'm sorry I can't say your name

365
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,660
When you tip it's because

366
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,660
I'm so

367
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,660
I'm like leaning back in my

368
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,660
In my desk

369
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,660
In my chair

370
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,660
And I'm actually so blind

371
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,660
That even my glasses can't help me

372
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,660
I can barely even see chat

373
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,660
Open

374
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,660
Go down the pebble path it's the driveway

375
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,660
Oh

376
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,660
Oh

377
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,660
We've got a guardian

378
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,660
Everything doesn't matter

379
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,660
We'll fill our pockets and go

380
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,660
Yeah fuck these parents

381
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,660
Steal their plants

382
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,660
Shit on their crops

383
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,660
Taste the onions

384
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,660
Piss on them a stick

385
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,660
Parents

386
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,660
Destroy the crops

387
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,660
Are you gay

388
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,660
Why are you acting so gay

389
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,660
Just a tip you could have the rest later

390
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,660
Thank you for just the tip

391
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,660
Bougie parents right

392
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,660
I need a seeing eye rat

393
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,660
I do

394
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,660
The rats have worse vision than me

395
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,660
Go down the pebble path

396
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,660
Energy conservation position

397
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,660
Yeah it's my energy conservation position

398
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,660
It doesn't put any

399
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,660
You know pressure on my bladder

400
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,660
Going through the window

401
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,660
Oh

402
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,660
Oh why'd you troll me then

403
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,660
No I didn't say that

404
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,660
Don't worry

405
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,660
Salt the crops poison the water

406
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,660
Yeah

407
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,660
Grab the rocks

408
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,660
Grab the rocks

409
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,660
Grab them and break through the window

410
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,660
Come on dudes

411
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,660
Don't be stupid

412
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,660
Wind plank

413
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,660
Two out of ten

414
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,660
That was a puny one

415
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,660
That was a pussy fart

416
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,660
Place down the plank wall

417
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,660
Still too high

418
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,660
Lift me up

419
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,660
Well no good

420
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,660
It's open but held in place by a latch

421
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,660
That's on the other side of the window

422
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,660
I might start muting to cough cause I know it's annoying

423
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,660
No good it's open

424
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,660
Damnit my fingers can't reach

425
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,660
Reach to unhook it

426
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,660
You go bitch

427
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,660
I'll push you up after you open the latch

428
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,660
You're just looking for an excuse to touch my ass

429
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,660
Okay two things

430
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,660
First of all no

431
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,660
Secondly like I need an excuse

432
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,660
Touch my ass

433
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,660
Tiny hands? What do you mean tiny hands?

434
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,660
Say for it should be something you would never say

435
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,660
Like I hate my brother

436
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,660
But I don't want to say that

437
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,660
I'm hurrying up and finding something

438
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,660
Before I slap you

439
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
Slab me

440
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,660
On my ass or the face

441
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,660
That melody I'll let you find out

442
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,660
Why are you acting so gay?

443
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,660
I love my little sister

444
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,660
I love my little sister too

445
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,660
I love my big brother

446
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,660
Thank you for the 420

447
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,660
The cops really add to the little sis vibe

448
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,660
Do they?

449
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,660
I feel like they're annoying

450
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,660
So it's the face

451
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,660
I'll find something to unhook the latch with

452
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,660
The rock

453
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,660
The rock

454
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,660
The carrot

455
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,660
A stick

456
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,660
Hi Amy how are you?

457
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,660
I'm okay

458
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,660
For now

459
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,660
Gen 2 leak

460
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,660
You know we actually saw the concept art for Gen 2

461
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,660
There's some interesting choices

462
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,660
Well we don't talk about Gen 2 yet

463
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,660
Gen 2 isn't even close to happening

464
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,660
Andrew helps you climb through the window

465
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,660
The open window

466
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,660
Give me your hand

467
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,660
I'll pull you up

468
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,660
Thanks but I much rather you just open a door for me

469
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,660
Oh yeah that would be easier

470
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,660
Ew why is the house so ransacked?

471
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,660
What happened?

472
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,660
Oh renovations

473
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,660
You turn the handle when the water comes out

474
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,660
Is this the door? No this is the door

475
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,660
Welcome welcome

476
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,660
Thank you not so fast

477
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,660
Now what do we say?

478
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,660
Thank you very much

479
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,660
Wrong try in

480
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,660
Exceptionally well done

481
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,660
That was an earth shattering performance

482
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,660
Yes to think you'd open a door so swiftly with such grace

483
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,660
Studying marvelous breathtaking

484
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,660
Those are but a few words

485
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,660
I'd use to describe your ability to trespass

486
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,660
May I come in now?

487
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,660
You better get the good ending

488
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,660
I'm trying

489
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,660
Take your hand bro stop fumbling

490
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,660
Not as romantic though

491
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,660
Wait what do you mean not as romantic

492
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,660
You may great let's split up

493
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,660
I want to get out of here as soon as fast as possible

494
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,660
Hey there was something I was worrying about

495
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,660
Right now can't it wait

496
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,660
Our situation is kind of sensitive

497
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,660
Well it can I guess

498
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,660
Good then tell me later

499
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,660
What you worried about

500
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,660
He's such a well trained big brother

501
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,660
He is

502
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,660
A fireplace

503
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,660
They have a goddamn fireplace Andrew

504
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,660
Yeah this is some rich people stuff

505
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,660
Who has a fireplace inside their house

506
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,660
It's not that uncommon is it

507
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,660
Not in older houses anyways

508
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,660
But is this

509
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,660
House old?

510
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,660
Fuck if I know

511
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,660
She's worried about that dream

512
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,660
You can train us like this in me

513
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,660
I totally will

514
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,660
The dresser is locked

515
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,660
Why is it locked?

516
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,660
Find the key

517
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,660
You don't even know

518
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,660
I don't know

519
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,660
I don't

520
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,660
Toys

521
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,660
Toys in a row

522
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,660
We should take those

523
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,660
Damn it

524
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,660
Is that all

525
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,660
Very tasteful living room

526
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,660
Did I go in this room

527
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,660
Oh yes

528
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,660
Check the closet

529
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,660
I did

530
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,660
Are you gay

531
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,660
Why are you looking so gay

532
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,660
Energy level is looking a bit too high

533
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,660
Thank you for the 420

534
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,660
It's not normal to do this

535
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,660
Without sibling

536
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,660
Do what without a sibling

537
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,660
Check the phone

538
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,660
Sorry if you hear some background noise

539
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,660
My rats won't stop drinking water

540
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,660
They're playing along with me

541
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,660
It's like the phone you never call

542
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,660
It's the phone your mom never calls you with

543
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,660
Notice how there aren't

544
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,660
Any photos of us here

545
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,660
So what

546
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,660
I guess I'm a little offended

547
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,660
It's not like there were any pictures in general

548
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,660
In our last place either

549
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,660
True

550
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,660
I need lip balm

551
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,660
Do I have it in here

552
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,660
Shit

553
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,660
My lips are dry

554
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,660
We love the rat ASMR

555
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,660
Also you can hear it

556
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,660
We have this part

557
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,660
What is this part

558
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,660
What is this part

559
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,660
I can moisturize them for you

560
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,660
So why

561
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,660
But doesn't moisturize them well enough

562
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,660
I need actual lip balm

563
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,660
But you can kiss them now

564
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,660
Now there are some

565
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,660
Why not of us too

566
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,660
Guess we're just too ugly to be put on display

567
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,660
Right maybe that's it

568
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,660
You're supposed to say I'm pretty

569
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,660
And you're supposed to be robbing the house

570
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,660
Get to it

571
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,660
A bunch of things to interact with

572
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,660
I am interacting with everything I can

573
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,660
I'm interacting with everything

574
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,660
It's the part where the thing happens

575
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,660
Wow okay

576
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,660
Thanks for letting me know I'm so excited for the thing

577
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,660
When the thing happens and the thing

578
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,660
I love it when things happen

579
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,660
In games

580
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,660
Oh the fridge

581
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,660
Not much in the fridge right now

582
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,660
Imagine if the parents came home

583
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,660
You are pretty good

584
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,660
I am

585
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,660
Why does the game

586
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,660
Why does the game OST sound like coffin dance

587
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,660
I don't know

588
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,660
I really like the opening though

589
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,660
Like when you're in the opening screen

590
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,660
I really like that music

591
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,660
There's like nothing to interact with

592
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,660
Who told who lied to me

593
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,660
And said there's a bunch of stuff to interact with

594
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,660
There's nothing

595
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,660
Are you pretty

596
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,660
It's not a question

597
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,660
Flip those two words around

598
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,660
And take off the question mark

599
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,660
It's you are pretty

600
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,660
Get it right

601
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,660
Check downstairs

602
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,660
Oh there's a downstairs

603
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,660
I didn't even see that

604
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,660
Why do they have a bed downstairs

605
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,660
Are you gay

606
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,660
Why are you acting so gay

607
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,660
You are pretty

608
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,660
Thank you for the 420

609
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,660
I am pretty

610
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,660
Yes

611
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,660
I am pretty

612
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,660
More training required

613
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,660
Yeah

614
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,660
Apparently you need to be like clicker trained or something

615
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,660
Like every time you get the compliment right

616
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,660
The prettiest

617
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,660
I mean it's so pretty

618
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,660
Keep saying it

619
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,660
Keep going

620
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,660
How much you are pretty

621
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,660
Very much or extra much

622
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,660
Whichever one is more

623
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,660
They've somehow managed to hoard all this stuff

624
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,660
In a spare bed to boot

625
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,660
Money is clearly no longer an issue

626
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,660
And the extra bed implies there are no issues

627
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,660
In their social life either

628
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,660
What does that mean

629
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,660
Are they swingers

630
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,660
Do they be swinging

631
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,660
String of lights

632
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,660
Metal box

633
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,660
A toilet

634
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,660
This one actually works

635
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,660
Are you gay

636
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,660
Why are you acting so gay

637
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,660
I love Emmys lemonade

638
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,660
Thank you for the 420

639
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,660
Are you gay

640
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,660
Why are you acting so gay

641
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,660
How about moan training instead of clicker training

642
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,660
Moan training

643
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,660
What is moan training

644
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,660
Are you gay

645
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,660
Why are you acting so gay

646
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,660
Today is payday so here is some allowance

647
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,660
For my cute little sister

648
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,660
Thank you for the allowance

649
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,660
All got 3 sips

650
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,660
Okay

651
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,660
Are you gay

652
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,660
Why are you acting so gay

653
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,660
Right now it's your turn to get training

654
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,660
Thank you for the 420

655
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,660
A triple

656
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,660
I will say you are cute

657
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,660
I am cute

658
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,660
Thank you for the compliment

659
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,660
You're doing good

660
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,660
Okay the floor dream seems a little clogged

661
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,660
Fuck

662
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,660
Okay

663
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,660
The floor dream seems a little clogged

664
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,660
But it's not your problem

665
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,660
No, it's not my problem

666
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,660
An excellent quality mop

667
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,660
Okay

668
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,660
Dirty laundry right at the top sits some sexy lingerie

669
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,660
How uncomfortable

670
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,660
Why does it keep telling me

671
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,660
6 out of 10

672
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,660
I think both of those were like a 4 out of 10

673
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,660
Okay

674
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,660
Cleaning supplies such as vinegar

675
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,660
The more you guys tell me to hydrate it

676
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,660
It actually is helping my throat a little bit

677
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,660
I mostly just have to clear it now

678
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,660
A washing machine and a tumble dryer

679
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,660
Your parents have been living it up

680
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,660
Bro I don't even have a washing machine and a tumble dryer

681
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,660
Don't worry about me though

682
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,660
I just

683
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,660
I have like a small tiny washing machine

684
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,660
But I don't have a dryer

685
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,660
And sometimes I go to the laundromat too

686
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,660
Vinegar

687
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,660
Hello

688
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,660
Documents about purchasing a house

689
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,660
There's also a key

690
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,660
Ah dresser key

691
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,660
Okay there we go

692
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,660
The sniffles are always the best

693
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,660
I haven't been sniffling have I

694
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,660
Have you considered drinking water for free

695
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,660
No

696
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,660
No

697
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,660
Why are you here

698
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,660
New and exciting hobbies

699
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,660
Tell me more

700
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,660
I don't think I will

701
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,660
But now it makes sense why mom kept hassling us to move out

702
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,660
They wanted to have sex

703
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,660
What's in there

704
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,660
No jewelry but some paperwork

705
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,660
It reads steer mister and mrs graves

706
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,660
You have opted in for compensation for damages caused by our company's error

707
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,660
Our representative will be glad to meet with you

708
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,660
Please come

709
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,660
Please come discuss the matter further

710
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,660
Are you gay?

711
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,660
At your earliest convenience

712
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,660
Why are you acting so gay

713
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,660
Thank you for the 333

714
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,660
I don't live in a cardboard box

715
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,660
I had to throw

716
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,660
I want to get like an actual like

717
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,660
Like the big ones

718
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,660
Which means I have to like move into an apartment

719
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,660
That already has it

720
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,660
That was my goal

721
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,660
To move into an apartment that has

722
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,660
A laundry

723
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,660
A laundry

724
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,660
A washing machine and a dryer

725
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,660
In-unit

726
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,660
In-unit, yeah

727
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,660
That means any

728
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,660
Pancu hung up

729
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,660
I hang my underwear

730
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,660
Because it's summer I hang it out to dry

731
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,660
It's out for the whole world to see it

732
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,660
I don't wash my hand, no

733
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,660
What's today's color?

734
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,660
That's a great question, I don't even know

735
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,660
Oh, it's um

736
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,660
It's black with a

737
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,660
Pink, purple, green and yellow butterflies

738
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,660
Okay, flipping through the folder

739
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,660
Something else catches your eye

740
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,660
It is the death certificate of Ashley and Andrew Graves

741
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,660
Cute

742
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,660
I didn't know he died 3 months ago

743
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,660
What the hell is this

744
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,660
I guess that explains why mom kept

745
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,660
Telling me not to call

746
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,660
It must have been spooky getting phone calls from a ghost

747
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,660
That's

748
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,660
I'm gonna need art of that later

749
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,660
Someone has entered the house

750
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,660
Oh shit, isn't it too early?

751
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,660
They shouldn't be home yet

752
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,660
You consider shooting whichever parent just came in

753
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,660
But you can't offer the souls of the dead

754
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,660
So you hold off on that idea

755
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,660
Is someone there?

756
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,660
Hi mom, it's just us

757
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,660
Andrew, what is wrong with you?

758
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,660
Don't do that, welcome home

759
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,660
Andrew

760
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,660
What are you doing here?

761
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,660
Why does the mom look so young?

762
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,660
Surprise, we came for a visit

763
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
Oh, I see

764
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,660
How are you home so early?

765
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,660
Did you get fired?

766
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,660
It's my day off

767
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,660
I was just out shopping

768
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,660
This is so awkward

769
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,660
Her name is Renee

770
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,660
Oh no, she's hot

771
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,660
Get away from my mother

772
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,660
Oh wait, no

773
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,660
Get away from our mother

774
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,660
It's my day off

775
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,660
I was just out shopping

776
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,660
How did you two get inside?

777
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,660
We broken

778
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,660
You left the door unlocked

779
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,660
You should really be more careful about that

780
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,660
She's 35?

781
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,660
She doesn't look 35

782
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,660
Did I really?

783
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,660
Hey, let me help you with those groceries

784
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,660
This is so weird

785
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,660
Thanks, you should have let me know

786
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,660
You were coming

787
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,660
How about some coffee?

788
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,660
Where do you keep the grounds?

789
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,660
In the top cupboard

790
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,660
But what about the quarantine?

791
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,660
Any milk in yours?

792
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,660
Sure, let me just go wash my face

793
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,660
Hag alert!

794
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,660
You guys think 35 is hag?

795
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,660
Some people age really well, I guess so

796
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,660
How old are the kids?

797
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,660
I don't know, it's a villainess, they don't say

798
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,660
Yeah, he is acting weird

799
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,660
30 is hag

800
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,660
Hag is 40 plus

801
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,660
Yeah, I always felt like hag should be like 40

802
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,660
If I want an old vtuber

803
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,660
I want her to be like my mom's age

804
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,660
Cause I think that's like

805
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,660
That's old

806
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,660
Calling my mom old

807
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,660
And vtubing 30 plus

808
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,660
In Japan it's like 25

809
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,660
In Japan it's like 25

810
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,660
That's so depressing

811
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,660
Andy is like 22 and Ashley is like 20

812
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,660
I believe

813
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,660
I saw some people trying to guess my own age

814
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,660
Some people genuinely think I'm like

815
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,660
Actually pretty old

816
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,660
Do I sound old?

817
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,660
I thought it was obvious

818
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,660
That I'm like a tiktok zoomer

819
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,660
You three

820
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,660
I've been actually drinking water out of my own volition

821
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,660
This is not good

822
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,660
Sure, let me go wash my face

823
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,660
What the hell are you doing?

824
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,660
Just play along for now please

825
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,660
Guess I'll make some coffee

826
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,660
This isn't good

827
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,660
You're 23? I'm not 23

828
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,660
Meat wine

829
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,660
Looks like your fans had a night planned

830
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,660
You sound 18

831
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,660
I'm not 18

832
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,660
Make sure to stay hydrated

833
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,660
I'll thank you for the 420

834
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,660
We didn't know who Nigel Thornberry was

835
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,660
So he can't be that old

836
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,660
Yeah I had to look up who Nigel Thornberry was

837
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,660
Is he from the Rugrats or something?

838
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,660
I'm not sure

839
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,660
Um, you brew some coffee

840
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,660
So I saw the fire on the news

841
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,660
What happened?

842
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,660
Why do you care?

843
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,660
Are you gay?

844
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,660
Why are you acting so gay?

845
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,660
I was informed that a certain darling little sister needed this

846
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,660
Thank you for the 420

847
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,660
Rugrats?

848
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,660
The Wild Thornberries?

849
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,660
Wait, he's not from the Rugrats?

850
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,660
Same production company

851
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,660
Close enough

852
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,660
Yeah, close enough

853
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,660
I haven't heard of the Wild Thornberries

854
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,660
Going down and talking to Rene as Ashley

855
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,660
in the basement has interesting responses

856
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,660
No, not Rugrats

857
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,660
Oh, sorry

858
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,660
I didn't even watch the Rugrats

859
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,660
But that's just because I didn't have cable TV

860
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,660
Pickles is Rugrats

861
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,660
Well first we got evacuated

862
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,660
After that they gave us the go ahead to leave

863
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,660
Since we've been cleared of the parasites anyway

864
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,660
Interesting

865
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,660
Oh this bitch is so

866
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,660
Guilty

867
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,660
She's so guilty

868
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,660
On the news they said everyone died

869
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,660
That would certainly make the story sell more

870
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,660
Anyway, here we are

871
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,660
Neither burnt nor full of parasites

872
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,660
I'm just glad you're safe

873
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,660
No, she's not

874
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,660
Yeah, you sure look like it

875
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,660
So um

876
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,660
Quite the upgrade from our previous place, huh?

877
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,660
She's not guilty

878
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,660
I remember some people want an option to smash the mob

879
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,660
Jail

880
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,660
Jail, rope, noose

881
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,660
Use it, oh my god

882
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,660
Put your head through the loop

883
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,660
And kick the bucket

884
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,660
Where'd you get the money for this place?

885
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,660
Did you finally win the lottery?

886
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,660
Huh, I wish

887
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,660
This house needs some serious repairs

888
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,660
But the area is so worth it, don't you think?

889
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,660
The perfect non-answer

890
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,660
They even hold barbecue events here

891
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,660
With the neighbors

892
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,660
And it's not a happy scene

893
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,660
Sister is okay but mother's note

894
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,660
Yes

895
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,660
Exactly, that's it

896
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,660
You got it right

897
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,660
Barbecue events just like on TV

898
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,660
I thought that was all bullshit

899
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,660
But no, they actually do that stuff here

900
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,660
Why are you acting so gay?

901
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,660
Thank you for the 6-9

902
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,660
My favorite letter

903
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,660
D

904
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,660
Your D

905
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,660
Okay

906
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,660
Oh, yako-don? I don't know what that means

907
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,660
What's o yako-don?

908
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,660
I'm just gonna say it

909
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,660
I'm just gonna say it

910
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,660
I'm just gonna say it

911
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,660
I'm just gonna say it

912
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,660
I'm just gonna say it

913
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,660
Yea

914
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,660
Yeah, sister base mom grows, yea

915
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,660
Oh

916
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,660
But you stick out like a sore thumb

917
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,660
You'd be surprised

918
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,660
I'm actually quite well liked

919
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,660
Oh, it's probably all thanks to my cooking skills

920
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,660
It's a shame

921
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,660
Where I actually didn't hear any

922
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,660
Mother plus daughter

923
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,660
Oh, yako-don is mom and daughter at the same time

924
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,320
user at the same time, struggles

925
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,080
family reunion meal

926
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,560
తిమమ సిటతాట్న రౠగ్주세요

927
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,040
but it was d mashed

928
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,260
Hey, what the hell?

929
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,960
the rest of the conversation is dreadfully boring

930
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,440
you don't contribute anything to it because you can't keep up with andy's lives or and i've been calling him andy instead of andrew

931
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,880
and if you're being honest you don't want to talk to your mother in the first place

932
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,120
well it was good seeing you your father should be coming home soon so i really need

933
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:43,120
to start making some dinner oh no don't worry about it i'll make something

934
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:48,160
you know full well that was her way of telling you to get lost why is she telling us to get lost

935
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,600
music popping off is it too loud

936
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:07,920
oh wait oh shit i'm gonna i can't turn it down she wants free space from her

well even then surely the poor grave siblings perished in the fire trust me it only takes one

1047
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,960
person to start digging into it and suddenly we've only alerted them and suddenly we've not

1048

01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:38,560
One her face, because Andrew is all I'll get.

01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:43,680

Ok!

ᴢ екотор לים  conditional

1123
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:18,860
lebrate the trinket charge. We'd atleast have the means to stay safe.

1124
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:24,820
I get that but if we leave quietly, there would be no need for anyone to look for us.

1125
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:32,020
o. he has his hand on her short-loop

01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:48,620
Oh. There isn't enough space in this house.

1138
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:51,620
Despite being far larger than the last one.

1139
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:54,620
And you're both already in your 20s.

1140
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:56,620
I don't know how else to say it.

1141
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,620
No, no, it's...

1142
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:02,620
Yeah, we're not fucking planning on living here. Thanks for the invitation, though.

1143
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:05,620
It's not like you're unwelcome to visit.

1144
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:09,620
There's just no room to keep housing you indefinitely.

1145
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:11,620
Yeah, I get it.

1146
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,620
I don't got no drip.

1147
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:16,620
You don't hear no drip. You're not hearing a drip.

1148
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:18,620
I'm not drippy.

1149
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:22,620
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

1150
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:27,620
Shower, shower, shower, shower, drinkable water symbol.

1151
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:32,620
Shower, shower, shower, shower, drinkable water symbol.

1152

Shower, shower, shower, drinkable water symbol.

1153
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:38,620
Shower, shower, shower, drinkable water symbol.

1154
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:40,620
Sorry, I'll drink.

1155
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:45,620
I'm gonna need to get more water soon.

1156
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:49,620
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

1157
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:52,620
That's funny because I heard a drip.

1158
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:59,620
Thank you for the 420. You didn't hear it from me.

1159
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:04,620
But since you're already here, I guess one night won't be a problem.

1160
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:08,620
We need to start looking for somewhere else to stay first thing in the morning.

1161
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:11,620
And...

1162
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:14,620
Dude, she knows.

1163
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:17,620
And it should probably be two separate places.

1164
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:22,620
Dude, she knows.

1165
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:26,620
She knows. She's onto us.

1166
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:32,620
There's a tall order after all our earthly...

1167
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:37,620
Sorry, sometimes I just have to take a break.

1168
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,620
Sometimes I just have to take a break.

1169
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:44,620
It's like getting in waves.

1170
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,620
I get it in waves.

1171
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:54,620
There's a tall order after all our earthly possessions just burn to the ground.

1172
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:57,620
That's a tall order. Sorry, that's a tall order.

1173
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:00,620
It's amazing what money can buy once you have a job.

1174
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:03,620
Speaking of which, I have a morning shift tomorrow.

1175
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:05,620
There's a spare bed in the basement.

1176
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:07,620
Andrew, you can take the couch.

1177
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:09,620
Alright, good night. Good night.

1178
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,620
Well, aren't you going to bed?

1179
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:16,620
I'm not that tired yet, so you are under my roof right now.

1180
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:19,620
Gay? Why are you acting so gay?

1181
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:22,620
If you need a break, why not a water break?

1182
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:25,620
Thank you for the 420.

1183
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:29,620
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

1184
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:35,620
The water flows over the falls, the waves crash into the shore, the rain drips off the leaves.

1185
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:46,620
Thank you for the tip.

1186
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:50,620
You're under my roof right now and you'll go to your designated sleeping areas immediately.

1187
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:53,620
Sleep now or get out at once.

1188
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:58,620
Damn, what a bitch!

1189
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:05,620
Going to sleep is the worst.

1190
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:08,620
I'm going to sleep at once.

1191
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:11,620
I'm going to sleep at once.

1192
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:14,620
I'm going to sleep at once.

1193
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,620
Going to sleep is the worst.

1194
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:21,620
During the day, all the noise and Ashley's never ending bullshit keeps your mind occupied.

1195
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:26,620
At night, alone with your thoughts, there's nothing to distract you from yourself.

1196
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:32,620
Despite having every intention of going to pick a fight with Ashley, you drift off to sleep.

1197
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:35,620
Oh shit!

1198
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:38,620
We're in a dream!

1199
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:43,620
The freezer isn't full of human meat.

1200
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:46,620
Remember how Andrew needs Ashley to hold him to sleep?

1201
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:49,620
Oh, he has nightmares!

1202
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:53,620
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

1203
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:58,620
This is definitely going to awaken something in at least one person here.

1204
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:00,620
Thank you for the $1.

1205
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:03,620
Bro, it's awakened something in me.

1206
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:07,620
Okay, I run out of water.

1207
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:17,620
I'm going to go get more. I promise I won't.

1208
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:21,620
I won't go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.

1209
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:46,620
I'll be right back.

1210
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:49,620
I'll be right back.

1211
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:52,620
I'll be right back.

1212
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:55,620
I'll be right back.

1213
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:58,620
I'll be right back.

1214
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:01,620
I'll be right back.

1215
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:04,620
I'll be right back.

1216
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:07,620
I'll be right back.

1217
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:10,620
I'll be right back.

1218
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:13,620
I'll be right back.

1219
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:16,620
I'll be right back.

1220
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:19,620
I'll be right back.

1221
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:22,620
I'll be right back.

1222
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:25,620
I'll be right back.

1223
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:28,620
I'll be right back.

1224
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:31,620
I'll be right back.

1225
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:34,620
I'll be right back.

1226
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:37,620
I'll be right back.

1227
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:41,620
I'll be right back.

1228
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:47,620
I'll be right back.

1229
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:53,620
I'm back.

1230
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:57,620
She's not going to make it.

1231
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:01,620
I'm going to make it.

1232
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:04,620
I'll make it.

1233
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1234
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:09,620
P-S-B-S-B-S-B-S-P-S

1235
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:13,620
I did not, I did not, I did not go to the bathroom, I um...

1236
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:14,620
Are you gay?

1237
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:16,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1238
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:20,620
Sorry about the water sip, but do you have any tea for your cold?

1239
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:22,620
Uh...

1240
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:23,620
I don't...

1241
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:24,620
Are you gay?

1242
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:25,620
Oh my god!

1243
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:26,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1244
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:29,620
Thanks for holding it in until now, I'm so proud of you.

1245
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:32,620
One...

1246
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:35,620
Two...

1247
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:38,620
Three...

1248
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:41,620
Um...

1249
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:46,620
I wanna keep the energy at all right, I wanna keep it at the all right level for now.

1250
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:50,620
I might, I might go down soon though.

1251
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:57,620
It's worse when I'm moving, like when I'm walking it gets worse.

1252
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:01,620
Okay...

1253
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:03,620
Okay.

1254
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:06,620
Okay.

1255
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:08,620
All right.

1256
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:11,620
When I'm sitting down it's okay.

1257
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:12,620
Greetings neighbor.

1258
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:16,620
Have thou arrived to borrow sweet granules of sugar?

1259
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:24,620
Behold, as thou may witness not, but flesh doth I possess to present unto thee.

1260
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:28,620
All ghosts are apparently required to speak like this,

1261
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:32,620
yes, even the recently passed ones, you read too much poetry.

1262
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:34,620
Ah, he reads poetry, that's cute.

1263
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:39,620
How much for a laugh around the room?

1264
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:48,620
I don't wanna say too much, I don't want people to get mad at me for saying a large amount.

1265
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:53,620
Also my room is very small.

1266
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:55,620
I'll say ten dollars if you want me to...

1267
01:14:55,620 --> 01:15:01,620
Here, I'll say fifteen dollars if you want me to go a whole lap around my entire apartment there.

1268
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:04,620
I'll do a...

1269
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,620
Oh, or jumping jacks.

1270
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:08,620
You can choose which one you want.

1271
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:13,620
Yeah, the same amount cause...

1272
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:15,620
Maybe, maybe smaller, smaller.

1273
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:20,620
Okay, fifteen dollars for a lap around my apartment, ten dollars for jumping jacks.

1274
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,620
There you go.

1275
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:27,620
You read too much poetry.

1276
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,620
Be alert, young Mr. Graves.

1277
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:33,620
It is time for you to compartmentalize.

1278
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:35,620
Rookie mistake?

1279
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:36,620
Why?

1280
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:41,620
Yeah, five jumping jacks for ten dollars.

1281
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:43,620
There.

1282
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:47,620
Jumping jacks are worse, no?

1283
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:49,620
Are you gay?

1284
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1285
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:53,620
One lap around the room.

1286
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:58,620
Okay.

1287
01:15:58,620 --> 01:15:59,620
Are you gay?

1288
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:01,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1289
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:02,620
Easy.

1290
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:06,620
Okay, I'll do the jumping jacks first.

1291
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:08,620
One dollar will just get...

1292
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:09,620
Are you gay?

1293
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:11,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1294
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:13,620
I'm singing in the rain.

1295
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:16,620
Just singing in the rain what a glorious feeling I'm happy again.

1296
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:19,620
Are you gay?

1297
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:20,620
Stop!

1298
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:21,620
Stop!

1299
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:22,620
Stop!

1300
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:27,620
PFFT, PFFT, PFFT, PFFT, PFFT, PFFT, PFFT, PFFT.

1301
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:28,620
Okay.

1302
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:29,620
Are you gay?

1303
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:30,620
Stop!

1304
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1305
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:33,620
How about both?

1306
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:36,620
Thank you for the hundred dollars.

1307
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:41,620
Okay, I'll do...

1308
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:44,620
What am I supposed to do for a hundred?

1309
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:48,620
How about I do twenty jumping jacks there?

1310
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:50,620
Twenty jumping jacks and then I'll run around the apartment.

1311
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:53,620
And when I say apartment, I mean I have to leave the room, but yeah.

1312
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:54,620
Are you gay?

1313
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:56,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1314
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:59,620
This is gonna be a workout stream now.

1315
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:02,620
Okay.

1316
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:17,620
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.

1317
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:22,620
Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

1318
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:25,620
Did I say twenty?

1319
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:26,620
I think I said twenty.

1320
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:31,620
I'm gonna go for a run now.

1321
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:35,620
Excuse me while I go run around.

1322
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:49,620
I'm sorry.

1323
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:50,620
I'm sorry.

1324
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:51,620
I'm sorry.

1325
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:52,620
I'm sorry.

1326
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:53,620
I'm sorry.

1327
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:54,620
I'm sorry.

1328
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:55,620
I'm sorry.

1329
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:56,620
I'm sorry.

1330
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:57,620
I'm sorry.

1331
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:58,620

01:17:58,620 --> 01:17:59,620
I'm sorry.

1333
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:00,620
I'm sorry.

1334
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:01,620
I'm sorry.

1335
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:02,620
I'm sorry.

1336
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:03,620
I'm sorry.

1337
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:04,620
I'm sorry.

1338
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:05,620
I'm sorry.

1339
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:06,620
I'm sorry.

1340
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:07,620
I'm sorry.

1341
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:08,620
I'm sorry.

1342
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:09,620
I'm sorry.

1343
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:10,620
I'm sorry.

1344
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:11,620
I'm sorry.

1345
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:12,620
I'm sorry.

1346
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:13,620
I'm sorry.

1347
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:14,620
I'm sorry.

1348
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:15,620
I'm sorry.

1349
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:28,620
I don't know why but running is worse.

1350
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,620
Running is like way worse.

1351
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:35,620
I brought chocolate bars though.

1352
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:38,620
You need five more?

1353
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:41,620
Five more jumping jacks?

1354
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:47,620
Okay.

1355
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:48,620
Are you gay?

1356
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:50,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1357
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:53,620
Gotta make sure to stay hydrated while exercising.

1358
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:57,620
Okay.

1359
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:58,620
Are you gay?

1360
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:00,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1361
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:05,620
Pour me make sure you drink plenty of water after having that major workout.

1362
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,620
Are you gay?

1363
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:10,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1364
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:14,620
Well after exercising you definitely need to hydrate a bit.

1365
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:17,620
Okay.

1366
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:18,620
Are you gay?

1367
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:21,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1368
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:24,620
How about some more exercise for my sweet sister?

1369
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:27,620
I don't even remember what I was supposed to do.

1370
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:30,620
It's $15 a jumping jacks.

1371
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:33,620
Are you gay?

1372
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:35,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1373
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:38,620
Are you holding it like a good girl?

1374
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:41,620
Yes.

1375
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,620
Yes.

1376
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:43,620
I am.

1377
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:44,620
$15 was running?

1378
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:45,620
$15 for a walk?

1379
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:46,620
Okay.

1380
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:48,620
I'll just do more.

1381
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:50,620
I'll do it all again.

1382
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:51,620
I don't remember.

1383
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:55,620
I'm so bad at memorizing what I said.

1384
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,620
Okay.

1385
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:57,620
Are you gay?

1386
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:59,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1387
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:01,620
Imagine the relief.

1388
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:04,620
Okay.

1389
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:08,620
Five more jumping jacks and then I'll run around.

1390
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:09,620
One.

1391
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:10,620
Two.

1392
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:11,620
Three.

1393
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:12,620
Four.

1394
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:13,620
Five.

1395
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:16,620
I'll be right back.

1396
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:28,620
Are you gay?

1397
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1398
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:32,620
Sweat the piss out to me.

1399
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,620
I'll be right back.

1400
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:35,620
Are you gay?

1401
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:36,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1402
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:38,620
Sweat the piss out to me.

1403
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:07,620
Did I get another jumping jack donation?

1404
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:12,620
I guess I'll do it again.

1405
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:14,620
One.

1406
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:15,620
Two.

1407
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:16,620
Three.

1408
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:17,620
Four.

1409
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:19,620
Five.

1410
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:20,620
Okay.

1411
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:21,620
That's it.

1412
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:22,620
That's all.

1413
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,620
I'm not doing any more of the $10.

1414
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:29,620
I'm not doing any more of the $10 or the $15 ones.

1415
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:33,620
You could donate $10 or $15 but I'm not doing any more.

1416
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:39,620
My energy level is no longer all right.

1417
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:41,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1418
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:44,620
I'm sorry for asking about the lamp but not really.

1419
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:45,620
This is fun.

1420
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:49,620
Thank you for the 20.

1421
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,620
I'm now at EEC.

1422
01:21:55,620 --> 01:22:00,620
We're only an hour and 22 minutes and I'm now at EEC.

1423
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:02,620
We're at EEC levels.

1424
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:06,620
I ran around the apartment, not the room.

1425
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:10,620
I have more than just my room.

1426
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:19,620
I brought chocolate.

1427
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:24,620
Are we bullying you too much?

1428
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:26,620
It's okay.

1429
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:27,620
That's your job.

1430
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:32,620
That's your job as my brother to bully me.

1431
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:36,620
You don't live in a closet?

1432
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:37,620
No, I don't.

1433
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:42,620
What chocolate?

1434
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:43,620
Right.

1435
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:44,620
I'm eating Marco Polo.

1436
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:46,620
It's one of my favorite chocolate brands.

1437
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:48,620
Okay.

1438
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:50,620
Are you gay?

1439
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:52,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1440
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:53,620
Good girl.

1441
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:54,620
Thank you.

1442
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:05,620
Okay.

1443
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:09,620
It's time for you to compartmentalize.

1444
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:11,620
Oh shit, my mouse isn't on the...

1445
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:14,620
Why did it disappear?

1446
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:15,620
What the hell?

1447
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:18,620
EEC.

1448
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:19,620
There.

1449
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:20,620
Okay.

1450
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:23,620
Take you for the head pass.

1451
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:29,620
Okay.

1452
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:32,620
Are you gay?

1453
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:34,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1454
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:36,620
I wish we could be jumping together.

1455
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:41,620
What do you mean jumping together?

1456
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:42,620
What do you mean by that?

1457
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:53,620
Jumping together.

1458
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:55,620
Okay.

1459
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:02,620
What's going on?

1460
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:07,620
Got a limb.

1461
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:09,620
Oh, do I have to collect all the limbs?

1462
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:16,620
I think you know.

1463
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:18,620
Explain it to me.

1464
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:24,620
Isn't it so sexy when I dirty talk with a mouthful of chocolate?

1465
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:26,620
Alright, Ashley already cooked one.

1466
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:38,620
What?

1467
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:39,620
What is going?

1468
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:42,620
Are you gay?

1469
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:44,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1470
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:49,620
I hope we'll hold until the end of the game.

1471
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:50,620
Good luck.

1472
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:53,620
I want to.

1473
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:55,620
Thank you for the tip.

1474
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:59,620
I want to hold, but if you guys keep doing this, I don't know.

1475
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:13,620
Okay.

1476
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:16,620
Do we have to find candles?

1477
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:22,620
Is that Lele?

1478
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:25,620
I don't answer.

1479
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:26,620
I don't care.

1480
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:29,620
You're not supposed to exist anymore.

1481
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:30,620
It says who you.

1482
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:33,620
You're not the boss of me, Andy.

1483
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:34,620
Forget this.

1484
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:35,620
Huh?

1485
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:41,620
Do not hurt little Lele.

1486
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:42,620
I won't.

1487
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:47,620
Stop following me around, you little shit.

1488
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:52,620
Where do I go?

1489
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:57,620
Oh, it sure is dark that way.

1490
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:59,620
Good thing I have these candles.

1491
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:00,620
Great, hand them over.

1492
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:01,620
No.

1493
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:04,620
Kill her?

1494
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:15,620
Kill her?

1495
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:16,620
Kill her?

1496
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:18,620
No, I won't, I won't, I won't.

1497
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:22,620
No, I won't, I won't, I won't ask nicely.

1498
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,620
May I have one of the candles please?

1499
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:25,620
Nope.

1500
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:26,620
Are you gay?

1501
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:28,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1502
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:32,620
If you can't just go in your piss drawer, I know you have one.

1503
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:34,620
Piss drawer?

1504
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:37,620
Piss drawer?

1505
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:40,620
I feel like that's some kind of fucking reddit story.

1506
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:43,620
Like how, like the cum, what was it?

1507
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,620
It was the cum shoebox, right?

1508
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:53,620
Or some guy came in a shoebox like over and over again,

1509
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:56,620
like every time he came, he came in that specific shoebox.

1510
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:57,620
You know what I'm talking about?

1511
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:02,620
I don't have a piss drawer.

1512
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:13,620
We have different reddits?

1513
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:15,620
Unfortunately, yes.

1514
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:17,620
Okay, some of you guys know.

1515
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:25,620
I only have so many left.

1516
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:29,620
If my lemon muffin has no candles,

1517
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,620
I can't pretend it's a cake anymore.

1518
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:32,620
Just eat it.

1519
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:34,620
That way you can pretend you ate the cake

1520
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:36,620
and you don't need candles anymore.

1521
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:38,620
Whatcha eating?

1522
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:39,620
I'm eating chocolate.

1523
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:41,620
This is my last one, though.

1524
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:45,620
Yeah, the coconut story, too.

1525
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:46,620
Here's the coconut story

1526
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:48,620
where he fucked the coconut and he, like,

1527
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:52,620
he, like, fucked the same coconut

1528
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:55,620
and he kept it under his bed, I think.

1529
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:57,620
And then he, like, looked inside one day

1530
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,620
and it was filled with maggots.

1531
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:02,620
And he kept it under his bed, I think.

1532
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:04,620
And then he, like, looked inside one day

1533
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:06,620
and it was filled with maggots.

1534
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:15,620
Come, canut.

1535
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:24,620
Okay, anyway.

1536
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:25,620
It's too precious to eat.

1537
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:27,620
God, you're such a tool today.

1538
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:28,620
Okay, whatever.

1539
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:30,620
Come, warm and squishy on the inside.

1540
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:31,620
Don't be gross.

1541
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:45,620
Mmm.

1542
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:51,620
Where do I go?

1543
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:54,620
Where am I supposed to-

1544
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:55,620
Oh!

1545
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:57,620
Okay, well, that did nothing.

1546
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:06,620
You're welcome.

1547
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:10,620
You familiar with kazu marzu?

1548
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:12,620
No, I don't know what that is.

1549
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:15,620
Mmm.

1550
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:16,620
The face tracking is not good

1551
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:17,620
because it's showing me

1552
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:19,620
eating with my mouth open like a slob.

1553
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,620
Every time I'm eating with my mouth open,

1554
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:22,620
I'm like,

1555
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:24,620
I'm not actually eating with my mouth open

1556
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:25,620
like that.

1557
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:28,620
My mouth is closed.

1558
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:35,620
But for some reason,

1559
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,620
it tracks it as if my mouth is open.

1560
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:39,620
Maybe because my teeth are open

1561
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:41,620
and my mouth is not open.

1562
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:43,620
I'm not actually eating with my mouth open

1563
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:44,620
like that.

1564
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:46,620
My mouth is closed.

1565
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:50,620
But for some reason,

1566
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:51,620
my mouth is open.

1567
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,620
Maybe because my chin is moving?

1568
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:54,620
I don't know.

1569
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:00,620
No, I don't actually eat like that.

1570
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:03,620
I have chocolate all over my fingers.

1571
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:04,620
Okay.

1572
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:08,620
Ooh, new room!

1573
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:15,620
No, I want to go to that room.

1574
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:17,620
Huh?

1575
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:21,620
How do we get there?

1576
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:26,620
Is it tracking your sound?

1577
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:27,620
I don't know.

1578
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:29,620
It's tracking both the sound and my mouth.

1579
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:31,620
How do I get there?

1580
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:33,620
Oh.

1581
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:35,620
What the fuck?

1582
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:39,620
Ah, fuck, coughing sucks.

1583
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:40,620
I don't like it.

1584
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:42,620
I don't like how coughing feels right now.

1585
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:48,620
What?

1586
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:52,620
What am I supposed to do here?

1587
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:57,620
Try going right from that path.

1588
01:30:58,620 --> 01:30:59,620
Right?

1589
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:02,620
I can't.

1590
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:03,620
It won't let me.

1591
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:05,620
Are you gay?

1592
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:07,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1593
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:09,620
Some water should help with your cough.

1594
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:12,620
Thank you for the 420.

1595
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:16,620
The bottom one.

1596
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:19,620
I don't know.

1597
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:20,620
I don't know.

1598
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:22,620
I don't know.

1599
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:24,620
I don't know.

1600
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:25,620
I don't know.

1601
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:26,620
I don't know.

1602
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:28,620
I don't know.

1603
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:30,620
I don't know.

1604
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:32,620
I don't know.

1605
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:33,620
The bottom one.

1606
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:40,620
It won't let me go right.

1607
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:45,620
Oh, oh.

1608
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:50,620
Oh.

1609
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:52,620
Oh, it's still on.

1610
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:54,620
Why is it so frustrating like this?

1611
01:31:58,620 --> 01:31:59,620
Oh.

1612
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:01,620
Oh, there we go.

1613
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:04,620
White noise.

1614
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:06,620
Even in your dreams, the entertainment sucks.

1615
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:10,620
It's supposed to frustrate you.

1616
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:11,620
Okay.

1617
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:14,620
Huh?

1618
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:15,620
So what do you want to play today?

1619
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:16,620
Nothing.

1620
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:17,620
Go to bed.

1621
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:20,620
Fuck, I have to cough.

1622
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:22,620
Every time I cough, I feel it, bro.

1623
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:25,620
Boring.

1624
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,620
I don't care.

1625
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:28,620
Go to sleep and never wake up again.

1626
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:30,620
I don't want to sleep.

1627
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:31,620
I want to draw.

1628
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:33,620
Draw, then.

1629
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:34,620
Just don't leave the spot.

1630
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:36,620
I can't draw without my coloring pencils.

1631
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:40,620
Well, if I nick myself, I can get red.

1632
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:42,620
I'll get youth pencils.

1633
01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:44,620
Thanks, Andy, you're the best.

1634
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:47,620
Where am I supposed to find coloring pencils?

1635
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:48,620
Are you gay?

1636
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:50,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1637
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:51,620
Relaxed.

1638
01:32:51,620 --> 01:32:52,620
Loose.

1639
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:53,620
Relieved.

1640
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:54,620
No.

1641
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:56,620
I am tensed up.

1642
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:58,620
Stressed.

1643
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:00,620
And pent up.

1644
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:05,620
Light the candle?

1645
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:09,620
Okay.

1646
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:16,620
Oh, oh, I didn't even see that.

1647
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:18,620
I was like, what happened with the candle?

1648
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:19,620
Oh, it's this thing.

1649
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:20,620
Okay.

1650
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:23,620
Talk to Ashley once again.

1651
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:24,620
Oh.

1652
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:29,620
Better get the colored pencils for her chop chop.

1653
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:31,620
Okay.

1654
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:39,620
Oh, I can't believe you didn't say tight.

1655
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:42,620
I am tight there.

1656
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:43,620
Is that what you want?

1657
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:47,620
Can I go down this way?

1658
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:52,620
Oh, oh, thank you for making it easy.

1659
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:56,620
Someone stares inside the room with an unblinking gaze.

1660
01:33:57,620 --> 01:33:58,620
Colored pencils.

1661
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:00,620
Is that mom?

1662
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:01,620
Julia?

1663
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:04,620
You've been quiet all day. What's up?

1664
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:07,620
Oh, no, it's nothing.

1665
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:09,620
Or actually I've been thinking about something a lot.

1666
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:11,620
Is this his ex-girlfriend?

1667
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:15,620
Check the phone at least three times.

1668
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:21,620
There are things to interact with beside the girl.

1669
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:23,620
Oh, okay.

1670
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:25,620
Voice mail and imagine you sent them.

1671
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:28,620
Okay, okay, I'll check the phone. Thank you.

1672
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:34,620
I don't know if I should bring it up.

1673
01:34:35,620 --> 01:34:38,620
With that much build up, you kind of have to now.

1674
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:41,620
Well, okay, but please don't get mad.

1675
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:45,620
When have I ever even raised my voice with her?

1676
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:47,620
You know you can tell me anything.

1677
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:50,620
That face doesn't look like a face I could tell anything.

1678
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:54,620
I talked to my sister about what you said the other day.

1679
01:34:54,620 --> 01:35:00,620
And she agrees with me that maybe it's like maybe it'd be better for Ashley to learn some independence.

1680
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:04,620
Even if it's just for her own sake, you know.

1681
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:06,620
What?

1682
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:07,620
And maybe for our sake too?

1683
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:09,620
What?

1684
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:11,620
I think it'd be nice if you could stay over more often

1685
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:15,620
and not like always cut things short or cancel on me so much.

1686
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:17,620
Sorry.

1687
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:19,620
I'm not reprimanding you.

1688
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:22,620
I can't make her learn anything though.

1689
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:27,620
Julia kind of snack?

1690
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:30,620
No, I don't think so.

1691
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:32,620
She's gotta go.

1692
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:36,620
Even laughing.

1693
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:40,620
This is his ex.

1694
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:41,620
Okay, okay, okay.

1695
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:46,620
If your sister needs something, wouldn't you go?

1696
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:53,620
Well, yes, but she only asks if she actually needs something.

1697
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:56,620
I suppose.

1698
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:02,620
Sorry, maybe I shouldn't have said that or brought this up after all.

1699
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:03,620
No, no, it's fine.

1700
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:11,620
Finally home from work.

1701
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:12,620
Hello.

1702
01:36:13,620 --> 01:36:15,620
Um, yeah.

1703
01:36:17,620 --> 01:36:19,620
Ashley is way better.

1704
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:20,620
Yes.

1705
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:21,620
Yes.

1706
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:22,620
Yes.

1707
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:24,620
Yes.

1708
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:33,620
Okay, let's keep going.

1709
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:35,620
Um.

1710
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:42,620
Um, I guess I'm still shook up over what happened to your friend way back then.

1711
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:44,620
Ashley might not look like it,

1712
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:46,620
but I think it affected her a lot too.

1713
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:49,620
So that's probably why she is how she is.

1714
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:53,620
I really don't get that impression at all.

1715
01:36:53,620 --> 01:36:57,620
For someone so obnoxious, she's surprisingly difficult to read.

1716
01:36:57,620 --> 01:36:58,620
Isn't she?

1717
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:03,620
Yeah, Emmys better, Emmys better than this fucking.

1718
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:04,620
What's her name?

1719
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:05,620
I don't even remember.

1720
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:09,620
I don't remember what her name was.

1721
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:13,620
Julia.

1722
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:14,620
Julia.

1723
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:15,620
Yeah.

1724
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:17,620
I don't know Julia, only Emmys.

1725
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:22,620
Oh fuck.

1726
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:26,620
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

1727
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:29,620
No, nothing go on.

1728
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:31,620
Anyways, I worry.

1729
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:41,620
I worry about something like that happening to her or happening to you.

1730
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:46,620
Ew, cringe, get this off of my fucking screen.

1731
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,620
It'll be fine if you're with me.

1732
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:56,620
Ah, would you tie your hair up for me?

1733
01:37:57,620 --> 01:37:58,620
Interesting.

1734
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:04,620
Oh heck no, you'll pull on it again.

1735
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:09,620
Fuck man, I wanna get excited so badly right now.

1736
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:15,620
But don't you know it's how boys show their love?

1737
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:18,620
Well that's just awful.

1738
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:21,620
I suppose she still lingers.

1739
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:28,620
I'm like really rocking in my chair right now, oh my god.

1740
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:35,620
It hasn't been that long, I just kind of forgot about her with all the chaos going on.

1741
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:38,620
Mostly death threats.

1742
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:40,620
The phone, the phone, where's the phone?

1743
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:43,620
Photos and notes of your girlfriend's churches.

1744
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:44,620
The phone.

1745
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:46,620
Yeah, he's a hair puller.

1746
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:51,620
You have 127 new voicemails.

1747
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:53,620
Oh hell no, you are not listening to all that.

1748
01:38:53,620 --> 01:38:54,620
Yes we are!

1749
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:56,620
I don't know what your fucking problem is.

1750
01:38:56,620 --> 01:38:59,620
The audio has been distorted but you'd recognize that voice anywhere.

1751
01:39:00,620 --> 01:39:02,620
I told you to fuck off, I warned you.

1752
01:39:02,620 --> 01:39:03,620
Do you think you're all that?

1753
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:05,620
Do you think you're somehow special?

1754
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:07,620
Ah, should I voice this?

1755
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:11,620
I'm gonna end up pissing myself if I do.

1756
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:16,620
You're just another whole.

1757
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:18,620
You're not even the only one.

1758
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:22,620
He's got a slew of flusies just like you.

1759
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:26,620
Enjoy what you have because you're well on your way out by now.

1760
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:31,620
The only reason he's with you is because he feels sorry for you.

1761
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:34,620
You're just some ugly cunt with a dead best friend.

1762
01:39:35,620 --> 01:39:37,620
Hurry up and kill yourself!

1763
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:41,620
And when you get to hell, ask your friend what happened to her.

1764
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:44,620
I can't laugh, I can't laugh, I wanna laugh.

1765
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:46,620
I wanna laugh.

1766
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:53,620
Bet you'd be, you'd be so surprised.

1767
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:55,620
Fucking die you worthless piece of shit.

1768
01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:59,620
Oh, you worthless piece of shit, go slit your wrists some more.

1769
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:01,620
And this time do it proper.

1770
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:04,620
Do you think you're better than me?

1771
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:06,620
Just because you can fuck him and I can't?

1772
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:08,620
Damn.

1773
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:10,620
You think that's love?

1774
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:11,620
Are you fucking delusional?

1775
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:14,620
Come dumpsters like you are just...

1776
01:40:17,620 --> 01:40:18,620
Okay, hold on.

1777
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:21,620
Give me like, give me like...

1778
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:24,620
Give me like, fuck.

1779
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:28,620
Okay, give me like, give me like 10 seconds, hold on.

1780
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:30,620
Wait a minute.

1781
01:40:57,620 --> 01:40:58,620
Are you gay?

1782
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:00,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1783
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:02,620
Take your time.

1784
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:12,620
I really wanna tell you to off yourself right now.

1785
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:22,620
Are you gay?

1786
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:24,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1787
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:26,620
Give you what?

1788
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:30,620
Are you gay?

1789
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:32,620
Stop!

1790
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:34,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1791
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:36,620
Break the dam, release the river.

1792
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:44,620
You should go jump off a bridge in Minecraft.

1793
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:52,620
Not like you loves me.

1794
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:54,620
I'm the only one.

1795
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:56,620
I'm everything.

1796
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:58,620
I'm the secrets you'll never hear.

1797
01:41:58,620 --> 01:41:59,620
Are you gay?

1798
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:01,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1799
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:03,620
Drip drips platter.

1800
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:05,620
Stop!

1801
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:17,620
When he lies in bed at night and when he needs someone to hold on to, it's not you he seeks out.

1802
01:42:17,620 --> 01:42:19,620
It's me.

1803
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:25,620
It's your ex-livers dormitory room.

1804
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:27,620
Okay, I have to change it.

1805
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:28,620
I have to change it.

1806
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:30,620
We're no longer in eek territory.

1807
01:42:30,620 --> 01:42:31,620
We're no longer in eek territory.

1808
01:42:31,620 --> 01:42:32,620
We're getting low.

1809
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:34,620
I know I'm so sorry it's only been two hours.

1810
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:36,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1811
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:38,620
Have you ever been to the Aquarium Mimmy?

1812
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:42,620
It's fun seeing all the gallons and gallons of water sloshing around.

1813
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:50,620
No.

1814
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:52,620
No, I've never been to the Aquarium and I don't wanna go.

1815
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:57,620
No, we're not doing a poll yet.

1816
01:42:57,620 --> 01:42:58,620
Are you gay?

1817
01:42:58,620 --> 01:42:59,620
Oh my god.

1818
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:01,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1819
01:43:01,620 --> 01:43:04,620
Anon, I think she might just broken the dam during the mute.

1820
01:43:04,620 --> 01:43:08,620
I mean just look at that cute atomic blush across her cheeks.

1821
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:10,620
I didn't, I didn't do it.

1822
01:43:10,620 --> 01:43:11,620
I didn't do it.

1823
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:12,620
I didn't break the dam.

1824
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:13,620
I didn't break the dam.

1825
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:24,620
Tell us how you're feeling.

1826
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:30,620
I feel like I can't describe it in detail on YouTube.

1827
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:37,620
I feel very full.

1828
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:40,620
That's, that's how I feel.

1829
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:43,620
Yeah.

1830
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:46,620
On a scale of 1 to 10, dude, 9.

1831
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:49,620
Tweet it?

1832
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:53,620
What do you hope to find?

1833
01:43:54,620 --> 01:43:56,620
What do you hope to find in there?

1834
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:05,620
And the fact that it doesn't really bother you bothers you.

1835
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:09,620
I wanted to finish the game today.

1836
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,620
I wanted to finish it.

1837
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:18,620
Are you gay?

1838
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:20,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1839
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:23,620
Imagine how good it will feel to let go though.

1840
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:24,620
Stop.

1841
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:25,620
You're just trying.

1842
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:27,620
You're just trying.

1843
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:31,620
Dude, it's literally, it hasn't even been two hours.

1844
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:34,620
Right.

1845
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:35,620
Layla, her crayons.

1846
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:43,620
You're really going to have to hold my hand a lot for the next few parts of the game until we end because I'm really struggling.

1847
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:44,620
Thank you.

1848
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:45,620
What should I draw?

1849
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:48,620
I wouldn't want to hinder your artistic genius with my bad ideas.

1850
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:50,620
Good call.

1851
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:53,620
As a thank you, I'll give you a candle.

1852
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:56,620
Treat it carefully as if it were me.

1853
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:08,620
I'm lighting it on fire.

1854
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:09,620
Not cool.

1855
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:11,620
That slams for you.

1856
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:14,620
Boo, you suck.

1857
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:16,620
Can I wait, hold on.

1858
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:21,620
I'm putting on the crying emoji because that's what I fucking feel right now.

1859
01:45:23,620 --> 01:45:24,620
Are you gay?

1860
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:26,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1861
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:29,620
Jimmy, you're such a good girl putting out with us.

1862
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:31,620
I know, I am.

1863
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:33,620
You don't deserve me.

1864
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:38,620
Okay.

1865
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:40,620
Okay.

1866
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:41,620
How about this?

1867
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:42,620
How about this?

1868
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:44,620
Because I want to finish the game.

1869
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:49,620
Or at least get further than I actually am.

1870
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:52,620
I won't end the stream if I go to the bathroom.

1871
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:59,620
I'll just keep going and you can tell me to keep drinking and we'll do it all over again.

1872
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:00,620
Okay?

1873
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:05,620
We'll just keep doing it over and over again.

1874
01:46:05,620 --> 01:46:07,620
Because I kind of...

1875
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:09,620
I kind of want to...

1876
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:10,620
I don't want to...

1877
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:12,620
Is that okay?

1878
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:15,620
Double endurance as long as it takes me.

1879
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:18,620
To at least get close to ending the game.

1880
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:20,620
You know?

1881
01:46:23,620 --> 01:46:25,620
I want to start a bowl.

1882
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:40,620
Are you gay?

1883
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:42,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1884
01:46:42,620 --> 01:46:43,620
Hi, Ami.

1885
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:46,620
Are you planning to open up memberships soon?

1886
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:47,620
Yes, tomorrow.

1887
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:53,620
There's your bowl.

1888
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:55,620
Are you gay?

1889
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:57,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1890
01:46:57,620 --> 01:46:59,620
We don't deserve you at all.

1891
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:01,620
So thank you for being here, little sister.

1892
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:02,620
Or in chart.

1893
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:03,620
Or in chart.

1894
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:08,620
Why are 56% saying no?

1895
01:47:09,620 --> 01:47:11,620
Oh my god.

1896
01:47:11,620 --> 01:47:13,620
Five more minutes?

1897
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:14,620
I'm not recording.

1898
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:16,620
I'm not fucking recording.

1899
01:47:21,620 --> 01:47:22,620
Wait.

1900
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:26,620
I'm gonna pin that one.

1901
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:30,620
Ah dude, it's not...

1902
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:32,620
Just a little longer.

1903
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:36,620
Are you gay?

1904
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:39,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1905
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:41,620
We can drink and refill the lemonade.

1906
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:46,620
You have to incentivize?

1907
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:47,620
I'm...

1908
01:47:47,620 --> 01:47:49,620
No matter what I'm not recording.

1909
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:51,620
Okay, I'll end the poll.

1910
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:57,620
I'll keep going for a little longer.

1911
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:00,620
Are you gay?

1912
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:02,620
Are you gay?

1913
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:04,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1914
01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:05,620
Stop!

1915
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:07,620
The other Twitter account exists for a reason.

1916
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:10,620
If we get a surprise post then I'm sure we'll vote yes.

1917
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:12,620
Are you gay?

1918
01:48:12,620 --> 01:48:14,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1919
01:48:14,620 --> 01:48:17,620
I know my little sister can hold it a little longer.

1920
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:22,620
Are you gay?

1921
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:24,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1922
01:48:24,620 --> 01:48:28,620
Good girl, just a little longer and you can go.

1923
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:31,620
This is literally blackmail.

1924
01:48:35,620 --> 01:48:36,620
What do I do?

1925
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:39,620
What do I do right now?

1926
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:47,620
Are you gay?

1927
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:49,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1928
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:51,620
Those are some cute moans, Imi.

1929
01:48:51,620 --> 01:48:52,620
You holding up okay?

1930
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:57,620
Yes.

1931
01:48:58,620 --> 01:48:59,620
Yes, I am good.

1932
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:02,620
What do I do? Please tell me what to do.

1933
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:03,620
Are you gay?

1934
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:04,620
Oh my god.

1935
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:06,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1936
01:49:06,620 --> 01:49:08,620
Anticipate the release.

1937
01:49:08,620 --> 01:49:10,620
No, no, I'm not anticipating shit.

1938
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:12,620
Anticipate these nuts.

1939
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:19,620
Put the candle in the candle holder.

1940
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:23,620
Oh my god.

1941
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:29,620
Are you gay?

1942
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:31,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1943
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:32,620
You got this, Imi.

1944
01:49:32,620 --> 01:49:33,620
Databayo.

1945
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:39,620
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I have this.

1946
01:49:39,620 --> 01:49:40,620
I have this.

1947
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:42,620
Ashley would have wanted to kill this one anyways.

1948
01:49:42,620 --> 01:49:45,620
You couldn't leave any witnesses after all.

1949
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:47,620
Still you can't comprehend why there hasn't been...

1950
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:48,620
Are you gay?

1951
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:50,620
Why are you acting so gay?

1952
01:49:51,620 --> 01:49:53,620
Please tell us if there's any leaking.

1953
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:55,620
There's no leakage.

1954
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:00,620
There's no leakage.

1955
01:50:03,620 --> 01:50:06,620
Surely someone found her before the fire burned the apartment down.

1956
01:50:06,620 --> 01:50:08,620
Is there an investigation going on?

1957
01:50:10,620 --> 01:50:12,620
Can this be linked back to you?

1958
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:14,620
Other than that, it doesn't bother you.

1959
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:15,620
I don't know.

1960
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:16,620
I don't know.

1961
01:50:16,620 --> 01:50:17,620
I don't know.

1962
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:18,620
I don't know.

1963
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:19,620
I don't know.

1964
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:20,620
I don't know.

1965
01:50:21,620 --> 01:50:23,620
Other than that, it doesn't bother you.

1966
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:28,620
This one you had to get before he got you.

1967
01:50:28,620 --> 01:50:30,620
It worries...

1968
01:50:30,620 --> 01:50:33,620
It worries you someone wanted you dead this...

1969
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:34,620
Uh...

1970
01:50:42,620 --> 01:50:45,620
It worries you someone wanted you dead badly enough to hire this guy.

1971
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:49,620
You killed this one to protect Ashley, no regrets?

1972
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:57,620
Back when he and his buddies still fed you, this one was always...

1973
01:50:57,620 --> 01:50:59,620
This one was always leering at her.

1974
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:01,620
Never mind, there's one regret.

1975
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:03,620
You wish you could have killed him sooner.

1976
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:07,620
I don't wanna beg.

1977
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:09,620
I don't want to.

1978
01:51:09,620 --> 01:51:11,620
That's so cringe.

1979
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:13,620
You won't get me too.

1980
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:15,620
There you are, you menace.

1981
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:16,620
Tada!

1982
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:18,620
I'm missing the one you cooked.

1983
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:20,620
I figured you'd have it.

1984
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:26,620
It's in your stomach, right?

1985
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:27,620
And mine?

1986
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:30,620
Are you going to cut me up to get it?

1987
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:31,620
I'd rather not.

1988
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:33,620
What do you need it for anyways?

1989
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:36,620
There's plenty of limbs right behind you.

1990
01:51:36,620 --> 01:51:37,620
That's true.

1991
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:38,620
That's true.

1992
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:43,620
Okay.

1993
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:50,620
Yeah, well, before was different.

1994
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:53,620
Before was not as embarrassing.

1995
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:57,620
Be...

1996
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:58,620
Be...

1997
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:01,620
Be possessive of the absolute...

1998
01:52:01,620 --> 01:52:02,620
Lim.

1999
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:06,620
Yeah, it thought not long to me for a chance to have a little...

2000
01:52:06,620 --> 01:52:08,620
Consequence to the...

2001
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:10,620
Oh my god, I can't laugh.

2002
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:17,620
Place a limb in the freezer.

2003
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:25,620
What do I do?

2004
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:31,620
What do I do?

2005
01:52:36,620 --> 01:52:37,620
What do I do?

2006
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:51,620
Oh my god.

2007
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:53,620
Dude, it's starting to throb.

2008
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:54,620
Oh my god.

2009
01:52:58,620 --> 01:52:59,620
Is it here?

2010
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:02,620
Am I supposed to get this last one?

2011
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:04,620
Uh...

2012
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:09,620
Oh.

2013
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:19,620
That's...

2014
01:53:19,620 --> 01:53:21,620
I reckon that my mortal...

2015
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:23,620
Uh, frame was consumed...

2016
01:53:23,620 --> 01:53:25,620
By the flames for...

2017
01:53:25,620 --> 01:53:27,620
Forsooth, I do not...

2018
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:28,620
Need things...

2019
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:29,620
Need...

2020
01:53:29,620 --> 01:53:30,620
Need...

2021
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:31,620
Need...

2022
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:38,620
I gotta cough.

2023
01:53:38,620 --> 01:53:39,620
How fuck?

2024
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:41,620
I'm not coughing, I'm not coughing, I'm not coughing.

2025
01:53:41,620 --> 01:53:44,620
Me thinks the innards of a freezer doth...

2026
01:53:44,620 --> 01:53:45,620
Do...

2027
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:46,620
Do not...

2028
01:53:46,620 --> 01:53:47,620
Doth...

2029
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:50,620
Not combust per chance and may cook, but to...

2030
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:52,620
Bro, the words...

2031
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:56,620
The words are coming out of my mouth, but I'm not computing right now.

2032
01:53:57,620 --> 01:53:58,620
Um, me...

2033
01:53:58,620 --> 01:54:02,620
Me thinks the innards of a freezer doth not combust per...

2034
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:05,620
Per...

2035
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:08,620
Per chance it may cook, but to burn, I know it's not.

2036
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:12,620
Uh...

2037
01:54:12,620 --> 01:54:14,620
Uh, verily...

2038
01:54:16,620 --> 01:54:20,620
Verily, the most foolish deed thou hast ever committed

2039
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:24,620
was to leave mine own remains in thine own dwelling.

2040
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:28,620
Praise the heavens that some soul sought to protect themselves

2041
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:33,620
and kindled a flame which engulfed all.

2042
01:54:34,620 --> 01:54:37,620
What the fuck is he talking about?

2043
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:42,620
I don't wanna do it, I'm not doing it, I'm not begging.

2044
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:45,620
This reminds me of something.

2045
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:49,620
You can't make me...

2046
01:54:50,620 --> 01:54:51,620
What's going on?

2047
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:52,620
Are you gay?

2048
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:53,620
Oh fuck you.

2049
01:54:54,620 --> 01:54:57,620
Chat, I'm heading to the bathroom real quick, BRB.

2050
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:00,620
Stop!

2051
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:11,620
Okay, um...

2052
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:22,620
Thy first sh...

2053
01:55:23,620 --> 01:55:25,620
Thy first shell forever linger in thy memory.

2054
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:26,620
Oh how...

2055
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:32,620
Stop!

2056
01:55:32,620 --> 01:55:33,620
Shut up!

2057
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:34,620
Don't say that.

2058
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:36,620
Hi chat, I'm gonna go pee, go...

2059
01:55:38,620 --> 01:55:40,620
I hope you fall in the toilet.

2060
01:55:45,620 --> 01:55:46,620
What do I do?

2061
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:47,620
Oh my god.

2062
01:55:48,620 --> 01:55:49,620
What do I do?

2063
01:55:54,620 --> 01:55:55,620
What do I do?

2064
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:01,620
The freezer?

2065
01:56:02,620 --> 01:56:03,620
Okay.

2066
01:56:05,620 --> 01:56:06,620
I don't...

2067
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:08,620
It doesn't...

2068
01:56:15,620 --> 01:56:17,620
You bag, shut up!

2069
01:56:18,620 --> 01:56:19,620
I went in the...

2070
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:21,620
I went in the game.

2071
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:25,620
The chest.

2072
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:26,620
Okay.

2073
01:56:26,620 --> 01:56:27,620
Are you gay?

2074
01:56:27,620 --> 01:56:28,620
Oh fuck.

2075
01:56:28,620 --> 01:56:29,620
Why are you acting so gay?

2076
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:31,620
This is getting good.

2077
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:33,620
Dude.

2078
01:56:53,620 --> 01:56:55,620
I'm gonna do another fall.

2079
01:56:56,620 --> 01:56:57,620
Oh god.

2080
01:56:58,620 --> 01:57:01,620
I don't know how long it's been since the last one, but I have to.

2081
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:03,620
I won't end the stream, don't worry, but...

2082
01:57:20,620 --> 01:57:21,620
I don't wanna beg though.

2083
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:23,620
I don't wanna beg.

2084
01:57:25,620 --> 01:57:26,620
I'm not gonna do it.

2085
01:57:26,620 --> 01:57:27,620
That's all you'll get.

2086
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:28,620
You'll get that shitty plaz.

2087
01:57:29,620 --> 01:57:30,620
Plaz.

2088
01:57:31,620 --> 01:57:32,620
Oh shit, it's so close.

2089
01:57:40,620 --> 01:57:41,620
Oh my god.

2090
01:57:42,620 --> 01:57:43,620
Gay?

2091
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:44,620
Why are you acting so gay?

2092
01:57:45,620 --> 01:57:46,620
NSFW Twitter.

2093
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:48,620
Remember it.

2094
01:57:49,620 --> 01:57:51,620
Not recording it.

2095
01:57:52,620 --> 01:57:53,620
No.

2096
01:57:57,620 --> 01:57:58,620
Fuck.

2097
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:03,620
Okay.

2098
01:58:05,620 --> 01:58:06,620
Ah!

2099
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:07,620
Oh my god.

2100
01:58:09,620 --> 01:58:10,620
Ah!

2101
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:11,620
Okay.

2102
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:13,620
Did you have a fun night?

2103
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:15,620
I'm sure you...

2104
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:17,620
I sure hope you learned your lesson.

2105
01:58:17,620 --> 01:58:18,620
There's no answer.

2106
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:23,620
I guess she's still sleeping.

2107
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:24,620
Are you gay?

2108
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:26,620
Why are you acting so gay?

2109
01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:27,620
Good girl.

2110
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:29,620
You're doing so great.

2111
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:31,620
This ain't fun anymore.

2112
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:33,620
It's fun to me.

2113
01:58:35,620 --> 01:58:37,620
It's okay if it's not for you.

2114
01:58:37,620 --> 01:58:40,620
You can go catch another stream, but it's fun to me.

2115
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:41,620
Don't worry.

2116
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:42,620
Don't worry.

2117
01:58:42,620 --> 01:58:46,620
I know I look like I'm struggling, but I promise you I'm having fun.

2118
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:49,620
I'm having so much...

2119
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:53,620
I'm having so much fun right now.

2120
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:55,620
Yeah, stop being a little pussy.

2121
01:58:55,620 --> 01:58:56,620
It's okay.

2122
01:58:57,620 --> 01:58:59,620
Lily kicks the crate.

2123
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:00,620
Wake up, sleepyhead.

2124
01:59:00,620 --> 01:59:01,620
Are you gay?

2125
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:02,620
Oh my god.

2126
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:03,620
Why are you acting so gay?

2127
01:59:03,620 --> 01:59:04,620
Sleush.

2128
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:09,620
Come on, don't.

2129
01:59:09,620 --> 01:59:10,620
You open the crate.

2130
01:59:12,620 --> 01:59:14,620
Oh, she's dead in there.

2131
01:59:14,620 --> 01:59:15,620
Oh my god.

2132
01:59:16,620 --> 01:59:17,620
Okay.

2133
01:59:19,620 --> 01:59:20,620
Are you gay?

2134
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:21,620
Oh fuck.

2135
01:59:21,620 --> 01:59:22,620
Why are you acting so gay?

2136
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:27,620
See, she's enjoying thinking about toilets and faucets and dripping water.

2137
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:30,620
Are you gay?

2138
01:59:30,620 --> 01:59:31,620
Oh my god.

2139
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:33,620
Why are you acting so gay?

2140
01:59:33,620 --> 01:59:34,620
Shut up, Grinit.

2141
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:36,620
Just enjoy the bratty sister's dream.

2142
01:59:39,620 --> 01:59:40,620
Are you gay?

2143
01:59:40,620 --> 01:59:41,620
Stop!

2144
01:59:41,620 --> 01:59:42,620
Why are you acting so gay?

2145
01:59:42,620 --> 01:59:43,620
Please!

2146
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:44,620
Only one way out.

2147
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:46,620
Just a few simple words.

2148
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:50,620
Are you gay?

2149
01:59:50,620 --> 01:59:52,620
Why are you acting so gay?

2150
01:59:52,620 --> 01:59:55,620
Good to know I was starting to feel bad.

2151
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:00,620
Are you gay?

2152
02:00:00,620 --> 02:00:01,620
Why are you acting so gay?

2153
02:00:01,620 --> 02:00:02,620
Stop!

2154
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:03,620
Please!

2155
02:00:03,620 --> 02:00:06,620
Just a pair of words and all your problems will flush away me.

2156
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:10,620
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, let me go, please.

2157
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:12,620

It's beckoning you.

2184
02:01:01,620 --> 02:01:02,620
Okay, it's a yes, right?

2185
02:01:02,620 --> 02:01:03,620

02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:46,080
What's going on?

2346
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:48,080
Whatever.

2347
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:50,080
If you're so weak that you died just like that,

2348
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:52,080
then clearly nature doesn't want you to live.

2349
02:05:54,080 --> 02:05:57,080
I'm not a brat, I'm just telling you how it is.

2350
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:00,080
Oh this brat.

2351
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:03,080
Angry, angry, angry, crying face.

2352
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:04,080
Get hydrated.

2353
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:06,080
Are you gay?

2354
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:07,080
Oh my god, what?

2355
02:06:09,080 --> 02:06:10,080
Good girl.

2356
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:11,080
See?

2357
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:13,080
Begging always works out for big brother,

2358
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:14,080
but it can't be helped.

2359
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:16,080
You're just too cute.

2360
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:19,080
Now with that, let's get around to started properly.

2361
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:20,080
Are you gay?

2362
02:06:20,080 --> 02:06:21,080
Oh my god.

2363
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:23,080
Thank you so much.

2364
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:25,080
I hope you didn't leave a trail when you went,

2365
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:27,080
but now I know not to go easy

2366
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:29,080
on you little brat you need correcting.

2367
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:31,080
Gay?

2368
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:33,080
Why are you acting so gay?

2369
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:35,080
Start drinking, angry.

2370
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:37,080
I'm drinking, I'm drinking, I'm drinking.

2371
02:06:39,080 --> 02:06:41,080
Yeah, they're really going crazy.

2372
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:44,080
Okay.

2373
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:45,080
Are you gay?

2374
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:46,080
Oh my god.

2375
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:48,080
Why are you acting so gay?

2376
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:51,080
Noted, we won't be as merciful next time.

2377
02:06:53,080 --> 02:06:56,080
I'm sure you'll give in just as easily next time.

2378
02:06:56,080 --> 02:06:57,080
I'm sure you will.

2379
02:06:57,080 --> 02:07:00,080
You can't help yourself when it comes to me.

2380
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:03,080
Okay, if you're so weak that you died just like that,

2381
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:05,080
then clearly nature doesn't want you to live.

2382
02:07:05,080 --> 02:07:07,080
Why are you acting so gay?

2383
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:08,080
Shut up, just shut up.

2384
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:10,080
Let's get through that second bottle.

2385
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:16,080
Okay, forget this.

2386
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:18,080
Let's just sleep right here.

2387
02:07:20,080 --> 02:07:21,080
Lesson learned.

2388
02:07:21,080 --> 02:07:23,080
No pissing for the next four hours.

2389
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:24,080
Four.

2390
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:26,080
Four?

2391
02:07:26,080 --> 02:07:28,080
You're not gonna make it to four.

2392
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:32,080
Are you enjoying this?

2393
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:33,080
Yes?

2394
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:34,080
Are you not?

2395
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:36,080
Are you gay?

2396
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:38,080
Why are you acting so gay?

2397
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:39,080
Good job sis.

2398
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:43,080
Thank you.

2399
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:46,080
Okay, since you took the stick off,

2400
02:07:46,080 --> 02:07:49,080
it looks like she went there on her own anyways.

2401
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:51,080
No, it doesn't.

2402
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:53,080
Why would she have clawed at the crate

2403
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:55,080
until her fingernails...

2404
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:59,080
until her fingernails split if she was there willingly?

2405
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:02,080
Oh well.

2406
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:05,080
It's not like anyone knows she's here.

2407
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:06,080
Let's just leave her.

2408
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:09,080
No, it'll start rotting.

2409
02:08:09,080 --> 02:08:11,080
And someone will come looking in front of her.

2410
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:13,080
Why are you acting so gay?

2411
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:15,080
I love my little sister.

2412
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:17,080
I love my big brother.

2413
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:20,080
Are you gay?

2414
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:22,080
Why are you acting so gay?

2415
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:24,080
No more pissing this stream

2416
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:26,080
that you're gonna need to beg proper to go.

2417
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:29,080
I did though. I did.

2418
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:30,080
Are you gay?

2419
02:08:30,080 --> 02:08:32,080
Why are you acting so gay?

2420
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:33,080
Oh my god.

2421
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:34,080
We will remember.

2422
02:08:36,080 --> 02:08:37,080
Good.

2423
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:38,080
Remember.

2424
02:08:43,080 --> 02:08:45,080
Is there a punishment for you

2425
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:47,080
if you go without permission?

2426
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:49,080
I won't go without permission.

2427
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:52,080
Let's just hide it then.

2428
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:53,080
Huh?

2429
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:55,080
If no one knows then it's not a problem.

2430
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:57,080
They're gonna know, Lele.

2431
02:08:57,080 --> 02:08:59,080
We'll find the body and they'll know.

2432
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:01,080
And then they'll throw me in prison for the rest of my life.

2433
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:02,080
Me too.

2434
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:04,080
It's fine if it's the both of us.

2435
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:06,080
No, you fucking idiot.

2436
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:07,080
You don't get it, do you?

2437
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:09,080
Guys and girls don't go to the same prison.

2438
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:11,080
They're going to take you away from me.

2439
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:14,080
Oh, he doesn't want me to go.

2440
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:16,080
That's so sweet.

2441
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:18,080
How is I supposed to know that?

2442
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:19,080
You figure something out then.

2443
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:22,080
Oh, you figure something out then since you're so smart.

2444
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:25,080
Okay, okay, let's just...

2445
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:31,080
Um, like, move her somewhere.

2446
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:34,080
Yes, agree, let's dig up a grave for her.

2447
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:35,080
Alright, where?

2448
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:37,080
Anywhere in the forest should be fine.

2449
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:39,080
I mean, there's a park right outside.

2450
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:42,080
Yeah, there's probably fine.

2451
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:47,080
But first we need to wrap her up in something.

2452
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:51,080
Because no one can see us carry her there.

2453
02:09:51,080 --> 02:09:54,080
This tarp.

2454
02:09:54,080 --> 02:09:55,080
This tarp.

2455
02:09:55,080 --> 02:09:57,080
This will have to do.

2456
02:09:57,080 --> 02:10:02,080
You wrap Nina's corpse inside the tarp and carry her away.

2457
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:11,080
I couldn't find a shovel, but I figured these wooden planks work.

2458
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:13,080
I mean, they're kind of shovel-y.

2459
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:14,080
Just watch for splinters.

2460
02:10:14,080 --> 02:10:16,080
Splinters are the least of my worries right now.

2461
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:19,080
Let's pick a good easy-to-dig spot.

2462
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:22,080
Got a wooden plank.

2463
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:26,080
They are so cute.

2464
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:31,080
They're so cute, I say, as they're, you know,

2465
02:10:31,080 --> 02:10:36,080
burying a corpse that they just murdered.

2466
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:42,080
You'd help me bury a body?

2467
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:44,080
Aw, thank you.

2468
02:10:44,080 --> 02:10:46,080
Okay, maybe here.

2469
02:10:46,080 --> 02:10:49,080
There doesn't seem to be any roots in the way.

2470
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:51,080
I'm tired.

2471
02:10:51,080 --> 02:10:53,080
Yeah, this is way harder than I thought it would be.

2472
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:56,080
Isn't this steep enough already?

2473
02:10:56,080 --> 02:10:58,080
A grave should be six feet, right?

2474
02:10:58,080 --> 02:11:01,080
Forget it, she fits here just fine.

2475
02:11:01,080 --> 02:11:03,080
Okay, fine.

2476
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:04,080
Put her in!

2477
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:06,080
Roll her in.

2478
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:08,080
Push the body into its grave.

2479
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:11,080
Cover her up.

2480
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:15,080
Are you gay?

2481
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:17,080
Why are you acting so gay?

2482
02:11:17,080 --> 02:11:19,080
You're so cute.

2483
02:11:19,080 --> 02:11:22,080
Thank you, I am cute.

2484
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:28,080
I'm gonna have to get more water soon.

2485
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:30,080
Crap, this doesn't look...

2486
02:11:31,080 --> 02:11:33,080
Crap, this doesn't look natural at all.

2487
02:11:33,080 --> 02:11:35,080
Looks fine to me.

2488
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:38,080
No, there can't be this obvious of a spot.

2489
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:40,080
It needs to be hidden too.

2490
02:11:40,080 --> 02:11:44,080
Why not hide it with some leaves and such?

2491
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:48,080
This isn't gonna work, we're gonna get caught.

2492
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:52,080
More foliage?

2493
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:55,080
This one.

2494
02:11:55,080 --> 02:11:57,080
Is this enough?

2495
02:11:59,080 --> 02:12:01,080
More?

2496
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:04,080
Greedy?

2497
02:12:07,080 --> 02:12:09,080
Is that enough?

2498
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:13,080
Yeah, this looks so much better, huh?

2499
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:16,080
Also, this is getting blown away by the next breeze.

2500
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:19,080
I'm drinking along, this is pretty hard.

2501
02:12:19,080 --> 02:12:21,080
It is!

2502
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:23,080
This little brat needs correcting.

2503
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:27,080
Okay, I ran out of water, I'll go get more.

2504
02:12:31,080 --> 02:12:33,080
This is the first time we ever heard her name though.

2505
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:35,080
It was always blinked up before.

2506
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:37,080
Oh, yeah, you're right.

2507
02:12:37,080 --> 02:12:39,080
You're right.

2508
02:12:40,080 --> 02:12:42,080
Okay, BRB.

2509
02:12:44,080 --> 02:12:46,080
I should take this one.

2510
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:49,080
I'm gonna take this one.

2511
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:53,080
I should take my nasty wrappers with me too.

2512
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:21,080
I'm gonna take this one.

2513
02:13:21,080 --> 02:13:23,080
I'm gonna take this one.

2514
02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:25,080
I'm gonna take this one.

2515
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:27,080
I'm gonna take this one.

2516
02:13:27,080 --> 02:13:29,080
I'm gonna take this one.

2517
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:31,080
I'm gonna take this one.

2518
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:33,080
I'm gonna take this one.

2519
02:13:33,080 --> 02:13:35,080
I'm gonna take this one.

2520
02:13:35,080 --> 02:13:37,080
I'm gonna take this one.

2521
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:39,080
I'm gonna take this one.

2522
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:41,080
I'm gonna take this one.

2523
02:13:41,080 --> 02:13:43,080

for a really long time

2601
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:56,160

2602
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:58,160

2603
02:17:58,160 --> 02:18:00,160

2628
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:02,160
what was it anyways

2629
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:04,160
I don't remember anymore

2630
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:06,160

2631
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:08,160

2636
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:22,160
who's going to play with you if I'm in jail

2637
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:26,160
I'll send you letters

2638
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:28,160
I can't read your crappy handwriting

2639
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:30,160
the cage is quite comfy once you get used to it

2640
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:32,160
oh yeah the cage is comfy compared to what I'm going to do to you

2641
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:38,160
she'll never say anything again

2642
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:40,160
mmm that makes sense

2643
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:42,160

2644
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:46,160

2645
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:48,160

2646
02:19:48,160 --> 02:19:50,160

2648
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:54,160

2651
02:19:58,160 --> 02:20:00,160
why are you acting so gay

2652
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:02,160
put me in the cage and pull on my leash

2653
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:04,160
little sis I've been a bad dog

2654
02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:10,160
I will

2655
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:14,160
if that's what you want

2656
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:16,160
but you know

2657
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:18,160
don't get mad at me if I start doing a little more

2658
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:20,160
because you asked for it okay

2659
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:34,160
okay

2660
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:36,160
whatever it's you and me now

2661
02:20:36,160 --> 02:20:38,160
no one else will like you

2662
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:40,160
because you're bad

2663
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:42,160
she's going to beg you

2664
02:20:46,160 --> 02:20:48,160
oh yeah I will

2665
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:52,160
and it won't be two inches

2666
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:02,160
it won't be two inches

2667
02:21:02,160 --> 02:21:04,160
that's for sure

2668
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:06,160
I'm kidding don't worry

2669
02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:10,160
you're a bad person Andy

2670
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:14,160
but I won't tell anyone

2671
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:16,160
of course not

2672
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:18,160
you'll be in trouble too

2673
02:21:18,160 --> 02:21:20,160
so what no one likes me anyways

2674
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:24,160
um that's fine

2675
02:21:24,160 --> 02:21:26,160
because you'll be around now

2676
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:28,160
are you gay?

2677
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:30,160
why are you acting so gay

2678
02:21:30,160 --> 02:21:32,160
how much do I gotta pay to get put in the cage

2679
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:36,160
it's for free don't worry

2680
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:40,160
you just have to misbehave

2681
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:42,160
and I'll put you in the cage

2682
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:44,160
I can't tell if these are retracted

2683
02:21:44,160 --> 02:21:46,160
or removed messages

2684
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:48,160
I think some stuff is getting deleted

2685
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:50,160
because I'm being a little sussy right now

2686
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:52,160
the whole three inch more

2687
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:54,160

2688
02:21:56,160 --> 02:21:58,160
you stay away from my bum

2689
02:21:58,160 --> 02:22:00,160
I'll stay away from your bum

2690
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:02,160
if you behave

2691
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:04,160

2692
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:06,160

2694
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:10,160
none of this needs to happen

2695
02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:12,160
okay just

2696
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:14,160
I know you don't like me

2697
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:16,160
Andy I know

2698
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:18,160
but that doesn't matter anymore

2699
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:20,160
because from now on no one will like you either

2700
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:22,160
is the cage at least padded on the floor

2701
02:22:22,160 --> 02:22:24,160
no why would I do that

2702
02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:26,160
why would I pad it

2703
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:28,160
the point of the cage is to be a punishment

2704
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:30,160
why would I pad it why would I make it comfortable

2705
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:32,160
the point is that you're you know you're sad in there

2706
02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:34,160
and you want me to let you out

2707
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:38,160
it's supposed to be like you know conditioning you

2708
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:40,160
are you gay

2709
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:42,160
why are you acting so gay

2710
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:44,160
how much to finish the bottle

2711
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:46,160
I can't I can't I can't

2712
02:22:46,160 --> 02:22:48,160
I can't

2713
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:50,160
I have to do it slowly

2714
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:52,160
I'm not trying to get water poisoning here

2715
02:22:54,160 --> 02:22:56,160
yeah the point is

2716
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:58,160
you know when you're alone in that cage you're sad

2717
02:22:58,160 --> 02:23:00,160
and anytime I come

2718
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:02,160
and let you out you get happy

2719
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:04,160
so that way you associate me with happy feelings

2720
02:23:04,160 --> 02:23:06,160
happy feelings

2721
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:08,160
yeah

2722
02:23:12,160 --> 02:23:14,160
anyways uh so let's be

2723
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:16,160
let's always be friends okay

2724
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:18,160
be my friend or else

2725
02:23:18,160 --> 02:23:20,160
sigh

2726
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:22,160
damn bro she's blackmailing him

2727
02:23:22,160 --> 02:23:24,160
I thought it was just to make sure

2728
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:26,160
I don't go into the neighbors garden again

2729
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:28,160
that too but don't worry

2730
02:23:28,160 --> 02:23:30,160
the doors and the windows are locked for that

2731
02:23:30,160 --> 02:23:32,160
I'll be whatever you want me to be

2732
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:34,160
really

2733
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:36,160
then from now on let's always

2734
02:23:36,160 --> 02:23:38,160
be together

2735
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:40,160
you had a million things you wanted to say to this creature

2736
02:23:40,160 --> 02:23:42,160
none of which were pleasant

2737
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:44,160
but absolutely nothing came out of your mouth

2738
02:23:46,160 --> 02:23:48,160
several days

2739
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:50,160
aren't you gay

2740
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:52,160
why are you acting so gay

2741
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:54,160

2742
02:23:54,160 --> 02:23:56,160
impressive

2743
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:58,160
I'd expect no less from my cute sister

2744
02:23:58,160 --> 02:24:00,160
sigh

2745
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:02,160
shut up it's more than that

2746
02:24:06,160 --> 02:24:08,160

2747
02:24:08,160 --> 02:24:10,160

2748
02:24:10,160 --> 02:24:12,160
no

2749
02:24:12,160 --> 02:24:14,160
the only thing you're allowed to be addicted to is me

2750
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:16,160
no

2751
02:24:18,160 --> 02:24:20,160

2752
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:22,160

2753
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:24,160

2754
02:24:24,160 --> 02:24:26,160

2756
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:30,160

2757
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:32,160
in strawberry ice cream is gross

2758
02:24:32,160 --> 02:24:34,160
I wish there was no jam

2759
02:24:34,160 --> 02:24:36,160
oh my gosh she's just like me I hate jam

2760
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:40,160
emi is the only drug anyone needs

2761
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:42,160
exactly

2762
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:44,160
emi before you go through this

2763
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:46,160
apartment scene check the balcony for

2764
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:48,160
a revealing scene

2765
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:50,160
okay

2766
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:54,160
has anyone asked you about things

2767
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:56,160
yeah my teacher asked everyone in class

2768
02:24:56,160 --> 02:24:58,160
some officers came by too

2769
02:24:58,160 --> 02:25:00,160
and did you say anything

2770
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:02,160
nope I only asked julia if she was expecting to see anyone the other day

2771
02:25:02,160 --> 02:25:04,160
why

2772
02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:06,160
you know because a certain someone told her mom

2773
02:25:06,160 --> 02:25:08,160
she went to study with julia

2774
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:10,160
so I thought maybe she told julia she was

2775
02:25:10,160 --> 02:25:12,160
gonna come see you instead

2776
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:14,160
wait well did she

2777
02:25:14,160 --> 02:25:16,160
I don't know because I didn't want to just come out and ask

2778
02:25:16,160 --> 02:25:18,160
okay wait the plot is confusing me

2779
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:26,160
julia said she was visiting family that day

2780
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:28,160
so I doubt she had any idea

2781
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:30,160
your promises mean fucking nothing

2782
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:32,160

2783
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:34,160

02:26:56,160 --> 02:26:58,160
great toxin

2819
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:02,160
is that it is that what you wanted

2822
02:27:10,160 --> 02:27:12,160
your success story is such an inspiration to us all

2823
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:14,160
before starting your soda company

2824
02:27:14,160 --> 02:27:16,160
you used to be a surgeon isn't that right

2825
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:18,160
that's right mark I am actually a doctor

2826
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:20,160

02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:22,160
one can of toxa soda a day keeps me

2828
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:24,160
far far away

2829
02:27:24,160 --> 02:27:26,160
even

2830
02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:28,160
when even a doctor tells me to indulge how can I not

2831
02:27:28,160 --> 02:27:30,160

2832
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:32,160

02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:34,160
well first of all with such a great demand

2834
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:36,160
comes a great need for

2835
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:38,160
water

2836
02:27:38,160 --> 02:27:40,160
which is why I've partnered up

2837
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:42,160
with several water distribution companies

2838
02:27:42,160 --> 02:27:44,160
I hope this is the start of a long lasting friendship

2839
02:27:44,160 --> 02:27:46,160
where the people on TV

2840
02:27:46,160 --> 02:27:48,160
rank on and on you're relieved there's absolutely nothing

2841
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:50,160
about dead girls being found

2842
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:54,160

02:27:58,160 --> 02:28:00,160
what no one told me to

2845
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:02,160
is that what you wanted me to see

2846
02:28:02,160 --> 02:28:04,160

2886
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:36,160
ok

2887
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:38,160
why are you acting so gay

2888
02:29:38,160 --> 02:29:40,160
good girl keep drinking

2889
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:42,160
ok

2890
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:46,160
ok

2891
02:29:46,160 --> 02:29:48,160
why are you acting so gay

2892
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:50,160
all day I've faced a bear

2893
02:29:50,160 --> 02:29:52,160
in waste without the taste of water

2894
02:29:52,160 --> 02:29:54,160
cool water

2895
02:29:54,160 --> 02:29:56,160
what a beautiful beautiful poem

2896
02:29:56,160 --> 02:29:58,160
oh my god

2897
02:29:58,160 --> 02:30:00,160
off to work now

2898
02:30:00,160 --> 02:30:02,160
don't let her off so easy next time

2899
02:30:02,160 --> 02:30:04,160
brothers

2900
02:30:06,160 --> 02:30:08,160
they will, I'll make sure they do

2901
02:30:08,160 --> 02:30:10,160
have fun at work

2902
02:30:10,160 --> 02:30:12,160
and you and Lele are learning from experience

2903
02:30:16,160 --> 02:30:18,160
I am a good girl

2904
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:20,160
ok briefly you wonder if killing her would be worth it

2905
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:22,160
I'm gonna make a blood oath with you

2906
02:30:22,160 --> 02:30:24,160
sex

2907
02:30:24,160 --> 02:30:26,160
but in return you'll have to promise me something too

2908
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:28,160
ok

2909
02:30:28,160 --> 02:30:30,160
keep my secret and I'll keep you company

2910
02:30:30,160 --> 02:30:32,160
and what if I don't

2911
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:34,160
are you ok

2912
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:36,160
why are you acting so gay

2913
02:30:36,160 --> 02:30:38,160
just one more

2914
02:30:40,160 --> 02:30:42,160
ok

2915
02:30:46,160 --> 02:30:48,160
you're all bark you wouldn't do anything

2916
02:30:48,160 --> 02:30:50,160
if you'll ruin my life anyways

2917
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:52,160
what reason is there for me to keep up appearances

2918
02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:56,160
moreover I'm doing this for you

2919
02:30:56,160 --> 02:30:58,160
then what happens if you break the promise

2920
02:30:58,160 --> 02:31:00,160
if you won't

2921
02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:04,160
I'm not buying that

2922
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:06,160
Lele you're a miserable loathsome being

2923
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:08,160
that has warmed its way into every aspect of my life

2924
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:10,160
hell yeah I am

2925
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:12,160
and for that my heart will always

2926
02:31:12,160 --> 02:31:14,160
have a rotten moldy sore spot just for you

2927
02:31:16,160 --> 02:31:18,160
make up about what you wrote

2928
02:31:18,160 --> 02:31:20,160
why are you acting so gay

2929
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:22,160
one more

2930
02:31:22,160 --> 02:31:24,160
ok one more

2931
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:26,160
I am ok

2932
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:28,160
oh my god

2933
02:31:28,160 --> 02:31:30,160
why are you acting so gay

2934
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:32,160
do it

2935
02:31:34,160 --> 02:31:36,160
pack gently you asshole

2936
02:31:36,160 --> 02:31:38,160
how does one cut someone gently

2937
02:31:40,160 --> 02:31:42,160
a better man would know

2938
02:31:42,160 --> 02:31:44,160
whatever

2939
02:31:46,160 --> 02:31:48,160
oh my god

2940
02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:52,160
oh my god

2941
02:31:52,160 --> 02:31:54,160
why am I attracted to this

2942
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:58,160
gay

2943
02:31:58,160 --> 02:32:00,160
only as long as you keep your eyes on me

2944
02:32:00,160 --> 02:32:02,160
one more after that I mean

2945
02:32:02,160 --> 02:32:04,160
oh ok

2946
02:32:04,160 --> 02:32:06,160
one more

2947
02:32:10,160 --> 02:32:12,160
I wish you liked her lips after that she probably did

2948
02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:18,160
let no hussy steal your gays it's just us now

2949
02:32:18,160 --> 02:32:20,160
I said I'd be around

2950
02:32:20,160 --> 02:32:22,160
I never said there wouldn't be others

2951
02:32:22,160 --> 02:32:24,160
what do you mean by that

2952
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:26,160
no I want to do over

2953
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:28,160
too late a promise is a promise

2954
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:30,160
Andy that's not fair

2955
02:32:30,160 --> 02:32:32,160
don't be like that I'll make you a priority

2956
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:34,160
just not the only one

2957
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:36,160
shut up I am the only priority

2958
02:32:36,160 --> 02:32:38,160
it's not enough why can't we just

2959
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:40,160
kill our parents

2960
02:32:42,160 --> 02:32:44,160
hold on that's not what she said back then

2961
02:32:46,160 --> 02:32:48,160
do it for your cute little sister

2962
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:50,160
kill them to solve all your problems

2963
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:58,160
yes in a proper relationship only blood matters

2964
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:04,160
kill them to feel something

2965
02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:06,160
kill them for food

2966
02:33:12,160 --> 02:33:14,160
that's actually so funny

2967
02:33:14,160 --> 02:33:16,160
kill them to avoid the things

2968
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:18,160
kill them to avoid the things

2969
02:33:18,160 --> 02:33:20,160
I'll do to you if you don't

2970
02:33:20,160 --> 02:33:22,160
what is that supposed to mean

2971
02:33:24,160 --> 02:33:26,160
look who's awake

2972
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:30,160
she's just whispering in his ear to kill his parents

2973
02:33:30,160 --> 02:33:32,160
or night it's still night time

2974
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:34,160
what do you want you little creep

2975
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:36,160
to offer mom and dad to the demon

2976
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:38,160
right now

2977
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:40,160
right now while they're asleep

2978
02:33:40,160 --> 02:33:42,160
we'll set the ritual up and do it

2979
02:33:42,160 --> 02:33:44,160
I've given you plenty

2980
02:33:44,160 --> 02:33:46,160
enough time to figure this out

2981
02:33:46,160 --> 02:33:48,160
yet you haven't

2982
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:52,160
it's always hot when Amy

2983
02:33:52,160 --> 02:33:54,160
whispers things to me

2984
02:33:54,160 --> 02:33:56,160
so now we're doing it

2985
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:58,160
kill your parents kill your parents kill your parents kill you

2986
02:33:58,160 --> 02:34:00,160
okay don't actually um okay

2987
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:04,160
oh my my efforts were far more affected

2988
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:06,160
than I thought welcome back Andy

2989
02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:08,160
that's not it but you have a point

2990
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:10,160
that mom might cinch on us

2991
02:34:10,160 --> 02:34:12,160
I knew that even before we got out of our apartment

2992
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:14,160
I don't know why I let myself

2993
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:16,160
think anything else after talking to her

2994
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:20,160
just because at your core

2995
02:34:20,160 --> 02:34:22,160
oh it's because at your core

2996
02:34:22,160 --> 02:34:24,160
you're just a soft gooey marshmallow

2997
02:34:24,160 --> 02:34:26,160
if it weren't for me

2998
02:34:26,160 --> 02:34:28,160
all kinds of vile women would have

2999
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:30,160
gobbled you up already

3000
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:32,160
chomp

3001
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:34,160
awww

3002
02:34:34,160 --> 02:34:36,160
what are you doing a demonstration

3003
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:38,160
you're so fucking dumb

3004
02:34:38,160 --> 02:34:40,160
I should

3005
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:44,160
uh oh uh oh Andrew

3006
02:34:44,160 --> 02:34:46,160
are you still awake

3007
02:34:46,160 --> 02:34:48,160
yeah

3008
02:34:48,160 --> 02:34:50,160
we totally weren't cuddling or anything

3009
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:52,160
yeah why are you still up

3010
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:54,160
I thought you had work tomorrow

3011
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:56,160
I wanted to talk to you

3012
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:58,160
without Ashley

3013
02:34:58,160 --> 02:35:00,160
it's not really a good time right now

3014
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:02,160
I know it's late but this is important

3015
02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:04,160
I've been thinking things over

3016
02:35:04,160 --> 02:35:06,160
and I believe I owe you an explanation

3017
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:10,160
that's alright

3018
02:35:10,160 --> 02:35:12,160
I don't really need to know

3019
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:14,160
I'm really tired

3020
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:18,160
Andrew I understand if you're angry

3021
02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:20,160
but at least listen

3022
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:22,160
the whole situation with Ashley was

3023
02:35:22,160 --> 02:35:24,160
oh

3024
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:26,160
oh go on mom

3025
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:28,160
don't mind little me

3026
02:35:32,160 --> 02:35:34,160
for the love of god

3027
02:35:34,160 --> 02:35:36,160
this had better not be what it looks

3028
02:35:36,160 --> 02:35:38,160
like

3029
02:35:38,160 --> 02:35:40,160
the way he has a pillow on his crotch

3030
02:35:42,160 --> 02:35:44,160
the way he has a pillow on his crotch dude

3031
02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:46,160
oh my god

3032
02:35:46,160 --> 02:35:48,160
I love this

3033
02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:52,160
whatever

3034
02:35:52,160 --> 02:35:54,160
how does this look to you

3035
02:35:56,160 --> 02:35:58,160
where'd you get

3036
02:35:58,160 --> 02:36:00,160
what's it looking like now mom

3037
02:36:00,160 --> 02:36:02,160
Ashley come on

3038
02:36:02,160 --> 02:36:04,160
Ashley put that away

3039
02:36:04,160 --> 02:36:06,160
there's no need for this

3040
02:36:06,160 --> 02:36:08,160
oh my god

3041
02:36:08,160 --> 02:36:10,160
be quiet and start walking

3042
02:36:10,160 --> 02:36:12,160
we're going to the basement

3043
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:14,160
and don't get any funny ideas

3044
02:36:14,160 --> 02:36:16,160
because I will shoot

3045
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:20,160
and the hand over the bite mark

3046
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:22,160
on his cheek oh shit

3047
02:36:22,160 --> 02:36:24,160
oh my god

3048
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:26,160
Andrew go get her over something

3049
02:36:26,160 --> 02:36:28,160
I'm tying this bitch up

3050
02:36:28,160 --> 02:36:30,160
and don't kill dad

3051
02:36:30,160 --> 02:36:32,160
you did not need to be told that

3052
02:36:32,160 --> 02:36:34,160
sigh

3053
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:36,160
a rope bro where am I going to find

3054
02:36:36,160 --> 02:36:38,160
all in the closet

3055
02:36:40,160 --> 02:36:42,160
squeeze me dad up

3056
02:36:42,160 --> 02:36:44,160
there's some rope in the closet

3057
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:46,160
along with other equipment

3058
02:36:46,160 --> 02:36:48,160
I wonder if this is fine

3059
02:36:48,160 --> 02:36:50,160
as you untangle the rope from everything else

3060
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:52,160
oh shit

3061
02:36:52,160 --> 02:36:54,160
uh oh

3062
02:36:54,160 --> 02:36:56,160

3063
02:36:56,160 --> 02:36:58,160
ok well we gotta tie up dad too

3064
02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:06,160
oh the best line is coming up

3065
02:37:06,160 --> 02:37:08,160
dad is already busy killing himself

3066
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:10,160

3067
02:37:10,160 --> 02:37:12,160
I need to uh

3068
02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:14,160
no good explanation as to why you're rummaging

3069
02:37:14,160 --> 02:37:16,160
through their sex toys the truth

3070
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:18,160

it tells you the pin and you scribble it down on a note

3194
02:42:24,160 --> 02:42:26,160

3203
02:42:48,160 --> 02:42:50,160
to blow up in our faces

3204
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:52,160

3312
02:47:40,160 --> 02:47:42,160
when it comes to being a mother I'm a fucking saint

3313

3316
02:47:48,160 --> 02:47:50,160

is it too schizo yet

3444
02:53:26,160 --> 02:53:28,160
no not yet

3445
02:53:28,160 --> 02:53:30,160
not yet

3446
02:53:30,160 --> 02:53:32,160
you match your schizo levels pretty well though

3447
02:53:32,160 --> 02:53:34,160
you think so

3448
02:53:34,160 --> 02:53:36,160
that's good

3449
02:53:36,160 --> 02:53:38,160
I think I'm gonna change the energy level though

3450
02:53:38,160 --> 02:53:40,160
cause

3451
02:53:40,160 --> 02:53:42,160
actually I'm pressin button

3452
02:53:44,160 --> 02:53:46,160
cause I'm no longer getting an alright

3453
02:53:46,160 --> 02:53:48,160
and I think I'm gonna

3454
02:53:50,160 --> 02:53:52,160
trust Andrew at all costs

3455
02:53:52,160 --> 02:53:54,160
oh fuck

3456
02:53:54,160 --> 02:53:56,160
already

3457
02:53:56,160 --> 02:53:58,160
okay

3458
02:54:04,160 --> 02:54:06,160
I already figured out as much

3459
02:54:06,160 --> 02:54:08,160
so I sketched them out for you

3460
02:54:08,160 --> 02:54:10,160
why didn't you just draw the runes themselves

3461
02:54:10,160 --> 02:54:12,160
there's blood right there

3462
02:54:12,160 --> 02:54:14,160
because you might have had a good reason

3463
02:54:14,160 --> 02:54:16,160
for not drawing them yet

3464
02:54:16,160 --> 02:54:18,160
fair whatever give me the card

3465
02:54:18,160 --> 02:54:20,160
I'll go pick up the rest of the money

3466
02:54:20,160 --> 02:54:22,160
I'll do the 2007

3467
02:54:22,160 --> 02:54:24,160
what's the 2007

3468
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:26,160
why are you acting so gay

3469
02:54:26,160 --> 02:54:28,160
I'll stop taking my meds

3470
02:54:28,160 --> 02:54:30,160
if it's for me

3471
02:54:30,160 --> 02:54:32,160
no

3472
02:54:32,160 --> 02:54:34,160
just because I don't take my meds

3473
02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:36,160
doesn't mean you don't have to

3474
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:38,160
or doesn't mean you shouldn't

3475
02:54:38,160 --> 02:54:40,160
are you gay

3476
02:54:40,160 --> 02:54:42,160
why are you acting so gay

3477
02:54:42,160 --> 02:54:44,160
kidney cleansing stream

3478
02:54:44,160 --> 02:54:46,160
so

3479
02:54:48,160 --> 02:54:50,160
once we reach low

3480
02:54:50,160 --> 02:54:52,160
I'll do the 200

3481
02:54:52,160 --> 02:54:54,160
what do you mean the 200

3482
02:54:58,160 --> 02:55:00,160
I really don't like the idea

3483
02:55:00,160 --> 02:55:02,160
of you wandering around all by yourself at this hour

3484
02:55:02,160 --> 02:55:04,160
it's already morning though

3485
02:55:04,160 --> 02:55:06,160
well yeah but I mean still

3486
02:55:06,160 --> 02:55:08,160
just hand me the card

3487
02:55:08,160 --> 02:55:10,160
actually can I really leave Andrew alone with mom and dad

3488
02:55:10,160 --> 02:55:12,160
who knows what they'll say to him

3489
02:55:12,160 --> 02:55:14,160
I just wish he was she enough as it is

3490
02:55:14,160 --> 02:55:16,160
Ashley

3491
02:55:16,160 --> 02:55:18,160
you wonder if you can trust Andrew enough to leave him alone with your parents

3492
02:55:20,160 --> 02:55:22,160
should I save

3493
02:55:24,160 --> 02:55:26,160
okay we're trusting Andrew

3494
02:55:28,160 --> 02:55:30,160
just give me the card

3495
02:55:30,160 --> 02:55:32,160
I'll go get the money

3496
02:55:32,160 --> 02:55:34,160
okay please be careful

3497
02:55:34,160 --> 02:55:36,160
aren't I always

3498
02:55:36,160 --> 02:55:38,160
when are you ever see you later

3499
02:55:38,160 --> 02:55:40,160
it'll be fine he won't turn on me as long as I have the trinket

3500
02:55:42,160 --> 02:55:44,160
save to be safe

3501
02:55:44,160 --> 02:55:46,160
I did save

3502
02:55:48,160 --> 02:55:50,160
there's nothing you can do about the missing audio

3503
02:55:50,160 --> 02:55:52,160
but at least you can draw some missing runes

3504
02:55:54,160 --> 02:55:56,160
where did Ashley get all this blood

3505
02:55:56,160 --> 02:55:58,160
from mama

3506
02:55:58,160 --> 02:56:00,160
is she making you do this

3507
02:56:00,160 --> 02:56:02,160
no are you going to kill us

3508
02:56:02,160 --> 02:56:04,160
come on of course not

3509
02:56:04,160 --> 02:56:06,160
technically anyways

3510
02:56:06,160 --> 02:56:08,160
then what is all this witchcraft looking nonsense

3511
02:56:08,160 --> 02:56:10,160
just let her scare you a little

3512
02:56:10,160 --> 02:56:12,160
we'll leave you alone after that

3513
02:56:12,160 --> 02:56:14,160
how about that

3514
02:56:14,160 --> 02:56:16,160
or how about it

3515
02:56:16,160 --> 02:56:18,160
trust in Ashley now

3516
02:56:18,160 --> 02:56:20,160
don't listen to mom

3517
02:56:20,160 --> 02:56:22,160
okay

3518
02:56:22,160 --> 02:56:24,160
I won't

3519
02:56:24,160 --> 02:56:26,160
it's hard to say whether she believes you or not

3520
02:56:30,160 --> 02:56:32,160
it hits you then that you're just like him

3521
02:56:32,160 --> 02:56:34,160
just like him

3522
02:56:36,160 --> 02:56:38,160
god damn it

3523
02:56:38,160 --> 02:56:40,160
interesting

3524
02:56:42,160 --> 02:56:44,160
oh my god that's the rune on my bed

3525
02:56:44,160 --> 02:56:46,160
there's something I tried to talk to you about earlier

3526
02:56:46,160 --> 02:56:48,160
I don't really care honestly

3527
02:56:48,160 --> 02:56:50,160
about Ashley what is it

3528
02:56:50,160 --> 02:56:52,160
I wanted to apologize to you for always making you look after her

3529
02:56:52,160 --> 02:56:54,160
there was nothing

3530
02:56:54,160 --> 02:56:56,160
that was wrong of me

3531
02:56:56,160 --> 02:56:58,160
it's fine can you imagine what it was like for me back then

3532
02:56:58,160 --> 02:57:00,160
when I was your age

3533
02:57:00,160 --> 02:57:02,160
I was already

3534
02:57:02,160 --> 02:57:04,160
ah

3535
02:57:04,160 --> 02:57:06,160
what if you listen to mom

3536
02:57:06,160 --> 02:57:08,160
I won't listen to mom

3537
02:57:10,160 --> 02:57:12,160
are the parents also bro and sis

3538
02:57:12,160 --> 02:57:14,160
that would be fucking crazy

3539
02:57:14,160 --> 02:57:16,160
I'm going to go to bed now

3540
02:57:16,160 --> 02:57:18,160
thanks for entertaining me hope you have a great night

3541
02:57:18,160 --> 02:57:20,160
thank you

3542
02:57:20,160 --> 02:57:22,160
thank you for coming

3543
02:57:22,160 --> 02:57:24,160
thank you for participating in our dgen hours here

3544
02:57:24,160 --> 02:57:28,160
she's good but we know a liar when we look them in the eyes

3545
02:57:28,160 --> 02:57:30,160
22-7

3546
02:57:30,160 --> 02:57:32,160
is 15

3547
02:57:32,160 --> 02:57:34,160
she was 15 when Andrew was born

3548
02:57:34,160 --> 02:57:36,160
do the math

3549
02:57:36,160 --> 02:57:38,160
if someone had not said the math

3550
02:57:38,160 --> 02:57:40,160
I wouldn't have known it was 15

3551
02:57:42,160 --> 02:57:44,160
when I was your age I was already stuck with a 7

3552
02:57:44,160 --> 02:57:46,160
and a 5 year old to care for

3553
02:57:46,160 --> 02:57:48,160
I think you'd have fair better than me

3554
02:57:48,160 --> 02:57:50,160
I wouldn't know

3555
02:57:50,160 --> 02:57:52,160
this isn't an excuse mind you it's an explanation

3556
02:57:52,160 --> 02:57:54,160
are you gay

3557
02:57:54,160 --> 02:57:56,160
I never hated you

3558
02:57:56,160 --> 02:57:58,160
is exercise still on the table

3559
02:57:58,160 --> 02:58:00,160
no

3560
02:58:08,160 --> 02:58:10,160
I want to play the game

3561
02:58:10,160 --> 02:58:12,160
I want to finish the game

3562
02:58:16,160 --> 02:58:18,160
but I also want to exercise

3563
02:58:18,160 --> 02:58:20,160
if you want to tell me to

3564
02:58:26,160 --> 02:58:28,160
you

3565
02:58:36,160 --> 02:58:38,160
it's okay don't worry about it

3566
02:58:38,160 --> 02:58:40,160
are you gay

3567
02:58:40,160 --> 02:58:42,160
why are you acting so gay

3568
02:58:42,160 --> 02:58:44,160
what exercise

3569
02:58:44,160 --> 02:58:46,160
like jumping jacks are running around

3570
02:58:48,160 --> 02:58:50,160
do a pull

3571
02:58:50,160 --> 02:58:52,160
do a pull

3572
02:58:54,160 --> 02:58:56,160
okay

3573
02:58:56,160 --> 02:58:58,160
I'll do a pull

3574
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:04,160
how do I rate exercise

3575
02:59:16,160 --> 02:59:18,160
I wrote yes

3576
02:59:18,160 --> 02:59:20,160
yes

3577
02:59:20,160 --> 02:59:22,160
no

3578
02:59:22,160 --> 02:59:24,160
okay

3579
02:59:26,160 --> 02:59:28,160
there's your pull

3580
02:59:28,160 --> 02:59:30,160
I never hated you I was just a fuck up

3581
02:59:30,160 --> 02:59:32,160
are you gay why are you acting so gay

3582
02:59:32,160 --> 02:59:34,160
will the exercise decrease your energy level

3583
02:59:34,160 --> 02:59:36,160
yes it will

3584
02:59:40,160 --> 02:59:42,160
it will of course it will

3585
02:59:44,160 --> 02:59:46,160
don't say that honey we did fine

3586
02:59:46,160 --> 02:59:48,160
so fine

3587
02:59:48,160 --> 02:59:50,160
look at where we are right now

3588
02:59:50,160 --> 02:59:52,160
anyways you were such an easy child

3589
02:59:52,160 --> 02:59:54,160
I thought we'd just

3590
02:59:54,160 --> 02:59:56,160
I thought we'd be just fine having another

3591
02:59:56,160 --> 02:59:58,160
I wasn't counting on Ashley to be so

3592
03:00:00,160 --> 03:00:02,160
I'm sorry I made you raise her

3593
03:00:02,160 --> 03:00:04,160
I thought you were getting along

3594
03:00:04,160 --> 03:00:06,160
so I didn't want to see what was happening

3595
03:00:06,160 --> 03:00:08,160
for that I apologize

3596
03:00:08,160 --> 03:00:10,160
it's all my fault

3597
03:00:10,160 --> 03:00:12,160
are you gay

3598
03:00:12,160 --> 03:00:14,160
drink more water first

3599
03:00:14,160 --> 03:00:16,160
angry

3600
03:00:16,160 --> 03:00:18,160

3601
03:00:18,160 --> 03:00:20,160

3602
03:00:20,160 --> 03:00:22,160
66 saying exercise

3603
03:00:22,160 --> 03:00:24,160

can someone remind me

3609
03:00:36,160 --> 03:00:38,160
the most important memory Ashley ever had

3610
03:00:38,160 --> 03:00:40,160
was a birthday party with lemon flavored cupcakes

3611
03:00:40,160 --> 03:00:42,160
because Angie was the only one who cared

3612
03:00:42,160 --> 03:00:44,160

3613
03:00:44,160 --> 03:00:46,160

Why are you acting so gay?

3796
03:09:55,160 --> 03:09:58,160
I know you're tired, so don't choke on your water.

3797
03:09:58,160 --> 03:10:00,160
Make sure you swallow properly.

3798
03:10:02,160 --> 03:10:04,160
I'm swallowing, I'm swallowing.

3799
03:10:08,160 --> 03:10:11,160
I think it might be time to get the puppy pads.

3800
03:10:13,160 --> 03:10:16,160
But they're not comfortable to sit on.

3801
03:10:19,160 --> 03:10:22,160
I don't like sitting on them, they're not comfortable.

3802
03:10:29,160 --> 03:10:30,160
Okay.

3803
03:10:31,160 --> 03:10:34,160
Well, it is what it is. It doesn't have to be.

3804
03:10:38,160 --> 03:10:39,160
Oh, fuck.

3805
03:10:41,160 --> 03:10:43,160

Okay, I'll get a puppy pad.

03:11:06,160 --> 03:11:09,160
I mean what? No, I won't do anything. Hold on one second.

3811
03:11:28,160 --> 03:11:30,160
Okay, I got out the more comfortable ones.

3812
03:11:35,160 --> 03:11:38,160
I think we can still sort this out. Isn't that right?

3813
03:11:42,160 --> 03:11:45,160
Okay, I got out the more comfortable ones.

3814
03:11:51,160 --> 03:11:54,160
I think we can still sort this out. Isn't that right?

3815
03:11:54,160 --> 03:11:58,160
I think we can still sort this out, isn't that right?

3816
03:11:58,160 --> 03:12:03,160
If it's money you need, I can help you get a job. They're hiring at your company, aren't they love?

3817
03:12:07,160 --> 03:12:10,160
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

3818
03:12:10,160 --> 03:12:14,160
This is basically a ring for its dream, but for piss so you should be good.

3819
03:12:15,160 --> 03:12:20,160
Okay, if you say so.

3820
03:12:21,160 --> 03:12:26,160
That's right, if I put in a good word for you years, could as hired.

3821
03:12:26,160 --> 03:12:30,160
Before warned though, they get a lot of difficult customers there.

3822
03:12:30,160 --> 03:12:36,160
But I know you can handle it. It should be easy after handling Ashley all this time. What do you say?

3823
03:12:40,160 --> 03:12:43,160
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

3824
03:12:43,160 --> 03:12:47,160
Well, I mean, since you went through the effort, might as well help you use it.

3825
03:12:47,160 --> 03:12:50,160
Oh, fuck you.

3826
03:12:53,160 --> 03:12:55,160
Decline.

3827
03:12:55,160 --> 03:13:00,160
Well, about Ashley, I wish you didn't talk about her that way.

3828
03:13:00,160 --> 03:13:03,160
Ah, he's defending her.

3829
03:13:03,160 --> 03:13:06,160
Did you seriously get a pat now? What?

3830
03:13:06,160 --> 03:13:09,160
What do you mean I wouldn't do that?

3831
03:13:09,160 --> 03:13:11,160
No.

3832
03:13:12,160 --> 03:13:14,160
Ahem.

3833
03:13:17,160 --> 03:13:21,160
Let's not fight. There's a solution somewhere, I'm sure.

3834
03:13:21,160 --> 03:13:23,160
What were those...

3835
03:13:23,160 --> 03:13:26,160
Oh, fuck.

3836
03:13:28,160 --> 03:13:32,160
What were those death certificates about anyways?

3837
03:13:32,160 --> 03:13:36,160
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

3838
03:13:36,160 --> 03:13:39,160
Never beating the PLO relegations.

3839
03:13:40,160 --> 03:13:45,160
I am beating the PLO relegations. There's no piss happening here.

3840
03:13:45,160 --> 03:13:47,160
It's the opposite.

3841
03:13:47,160 --> 03:13:51,160
No, there's no aftermath pick happening either.

3842
03:13:54,160 --> 03:13:58,160
It's the life insurance game, nothing more. How's that work?

3843
03:13:58,160 --> 03:14:00,160
There's this doctor.

3844
03:14:00,160 --> 03:14:04,160
Well, a surgeon actually, after they told us you'll be stuck in that apartment.

3845
03:14:04,160 --> 03:14:06,160
Gay? Why are you acting so gay?

3846
03:14:06,160 --> 03:14:09,160
We can't go easy on you this time.

3847
03:14:10,160 --> 03:14:14,160
No, no, of course not. Of course you won't.

3848
03:14:14,160 --> 03:14:17,160
Don't worry, I know you won't.

3849
03:14:18,160 --> 03:14:20,160
Sure.

3850
03:14:20,160 --> 03:14:23,160
Cup pick? No!

3851
03:14:23,160 --> 03:14:27,160
No, absolutely not. You're begging so much though.

3852
03:14:27,160 --> 03:14:29,160
I'm sorry.

3853
03:14:30,160 --> 03:14:32,160
I'm sorry.

3854
03:14:33,160 --> 03:14:36,160
No, absolutely not. You're begging so much though.

3855
03:14:36,160 --> 03:14:40,160
Maybe if you keep begging a little more, I might.

3856
03:14:40,160 --> 03:14:45,160
Okay, well, I got it for you two after you got quarantined.

3857
03:14:45,160 --> 03:14:49,160
It's kind of curious that they let you do that.

3858
03:14:49,160 --> 03:14:51,160
Please.

3859
03:14:51,160 --> 03:14:55,160
You're gonna need to do more than just please.

3860
03:14:55,160 --> 03:14:58,160
If he's legally dead, the offer to get him a job was a lie either.

3861
03:14:58,160 --> 03:15:00,160
Anyways, ooh, you're right.

3862
03:15:00,160 --> 03:15:05,160
So then when we died, were you in on it?

3863
03:15:05,160 --> 03:15:09,160
Of course not. I really thought you died.

3864
03:15:09,160 --> 03:15:13,160
Pretty please, you'll be the one begging soon.

3865
03:15:14,160 --> 03:15:17,160
Please, please, please, please.

3866
03:15:17,160 --> 03:15:20,160
Yeah, yeah, keep begging, keep begging.

3867
03:15:20,160 --> 03:15:22,160
I will totally do it if you beg.

3868
03:15:22,160 --> 03:15:25,160
Gay? Why are you acting so gay?

3869
03:15:25,160 --> 03:15:29,160
There is no piss yet, Timmy. That's what you meant to say at least.

3870
03:15:29,160 --> 03:15:31,160
There won't be any.

3871
03:15:31,160 --> 03:15:35,160
Gets on you is pretty please with sugar on top, you're the best girl ever.

3872
03:15:35,160 --> 03:15:37,160
I know I am.

3873
03:15:41,160 --> 03:15:45,160
Keep going, keep going. I might do it.

3874
03:15:46,160 --> 03:15:49,160
They said your bodies had to be burned because of the parasites,

3875
03:15:49,160 --> 03:15:52,160
so that's why I never got to confirm it myself.

3876
03:15:52,160 --> 03:15:54,160
She's so full of shit.

3877
03:15:54,160 --> 03:15:56,160
Where are you going?

3878
03:15:56,160 --> 03:15:59,160
I have to finish setting things up for her.

3879
03:15:59,160 --> 03:16:03,160
Oh, come on, forget about this nonsense, we can sort the documents out.

3880
03:16:03,160 --> 03:16:06,160
Hell, you can even live here if that doesn't work out.

3881
03:16:06,160 --> 03:16:10,160
You can leave this whole mess behind just like that, behind you, just like that.

3882
03:16:11,160 --> 03:16:14,160
Don't fall for your chat, fall for what?

3883
03:16:16,160 --> 03:16:20,160
Pretty please, you know we're worth it. Are you?

3884
03:16:26,160 --> 03:16:28,160
Please little sis, you love your big brother, don't you?

3885
03:16:28,160 --> 03:16:31,160
I do, I do, that's why I love to hear you beg.

3886
03:16:37,160 --> 03:16:40,160
She's trying to get you to abandon Ashley just like she did.

3887
03:16:40,160 --> 03:16:42,160
I won't do it though.

3888
03:16:43,160 --> 03:16:46,160
That's okay, I'm not really interested.

3889
03:16:46,160 --> 03:16:49,160
What? But that doesn't make any sense, why would you not?

3890
03:16:50,160 --> 03:16:52,160
I get it.

3891
03:16:53,160 --> 03:16:56,160
You fuck her.

3892
03:17:04,160 --> 03:17:06,160
What? Huh?

3893
03:17:07,160 --> 03:17:11,160
Oh, that is disgusting, Andrew, she's your sister for God's sake.

3894
03:17:12,160 --> 03:17:14,160
I haven't done anything with the hell mom.

3895
03:17:14,160 --> 03:17:18,160
Then what does she give you that makes it worth all this?

3896
03:17:18,160 --> 03:17:20,160
Well, that's none of your business is it?

3897
03:17:20,160 --> 03:17:22,160
I knew something was off.

3898
03:17:22,160 --> 03:17:26,160
How did I fuck up so bad? I'm the worst mother ever.

3899
03:17:26,160 --> 03:17:28,160
Are you gay?

3900
03:17:28,160 --> 03:17:30,160
Why are you acting so gay?

3901
03:17:30,160 --> 03:17:31,160
She knows.

3902
03:17:31,160 --> 03:17:33,160
Chat, stop acting like little brothers.

3903
03:17:33,160 --> 03:17:35,160
Bulley our little sis more.

3904
03:17:35,160 --> 03:17:36,160
Stop begging.

3905
03:17:37,160 --> 03:17:38,160
Are you gay?

3906
03:17:38,160 --> 03:17:40,160
Why are you acting so gay?

3907
03:17:40,160 --> 03:17:42,160
Gaslighting the chimney.

3908
03:17:42,160 --> 03:17:44,160
I'm not gaslighting.

3909
03:17:44,160 --> 03:17:47,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

3910
03:17:48,160 --> 03:17:50,160
I said I'm gay.

3911
03:17:50,160 --> 03:17:52,160
Why are you acting so gay?

3912
03:17:52,160 --> 03:17:55,160
She's my sister. Kind of hot.

3913
03:17:56,160 --> 03:17:59,160
No, I mean, yes you are, but I have never...

3914
03:17:59,160 --> 03:18:01,160
I'm back.

3915
03:18:01,160 --> 03:18:03,160
Now of all times.

3916
03:18:07,160 --> 03:18:10,160
I got the money, did you miss me handsome?

3917
03:18:10,160 --> 03:18:12,160
Did you, did you?

3918
03:18:13,160 --> 03:18:14,160
Oh fuck.

3919
03:18:14,160 --> 03:18:17,160
We're not beating the incest allegations from mom.

3920
03:18:17,160 --> 03:18:19,160
I wanna die.

3921
03:18:20,160 --> 03:18:23,160
Whatever, some in the fucking demon already.

3922
03:18:23,160 --> 03:18:26,160
I was so eager. Let's see if it shows up though.

3923
03:18:26,160 --> 03:18:28,160
Since there's no music.

3924
03:18:28,160 --> 03:18:29,160
Wait, what are you talking about?

3925
03:18:29,160 --> 03:18:30,160
Quiet you, I'm still armed.

3926
03:18:30,160 --> 03:18:32,160
Aren't you like the candles?

3927
03:18:32,160 --> 03:18:34,160
Why are you acting so gay?

3928
03:18:34,160 --> 03:18:37,160
This bratty sis needs more hydration.

3929
03:18:43,160 --> 03:18:45,160
Mom really cannot imagine you just loving Ashley

3930
03:18:45,160 --> 03:18:47,160
and not wanting to have been her.

3931
03:18:47,160 --> 03:18:49,160
I know, what a bitch.

3932
03:18:52,160 --> 03:18:54,160
Right, light the candles.

3933
03:18:58,160 --> 03:19:00,160
Get to it.

3934
03:19:04,160 --> 03:19:06,160
Are you gay?

3935
03:19:06,160 --> 03:19:08,160
Why are you acting so gay?

3936
03:19:08,160 --> 03:19:10,160
Sip, sip, sip.

3937
03:19:11,160 --> 03:19:13,160
Fuck, coughing sucks.

3938
03:19:15,160 --> 03:19:16,160
Mom is just jealous.

3939
03:19:16,160 --> 03:19:18,160
Yeah, she wishes she had what we had.

3940
03:19:20,160 --> 03:19:22,160
Or what we have.

3941
03:19:26,160 --> 03:19:28,160
This upcoming scene is not gonna help the allegations.

3942
03:19:30,160 --> 03:19:32,160
I'm sorry I don't have the mood music,

3943
03:19:32,160 --> 03:19:34,160
but I have the other stuff you asked for.

3944
03:19:35,160 --> 03:19:37,160
Maybe if I sing something, please don't.

3945
03:19:37,160 --> 03:19:39,160
The demon shows up to spare everyone

3946
03:19:39,160 --> 03:19:41,160
from the second human embarrassment.

3947
03:19:41,160 --> 03:19:43,160
Ah, sorry soul.

3948
03:19:43,160 --> 03:19:44,160
What the fuck is that?

3949
03:19:44,160 --> 03:19:46,160
I offer those two.

3950
03:19:48,160 --> 03:19:49,160
They're screaming as short lived

3951
03:19:49,160 --> 03:19:51,160
as the demon steals their souls.

3952
03:19:51,160 --> 03:19:53,160
Oh, that was easy.

3953
03:19:53,160 --> 03:19:55,160
I wonder if I should feel something.

3954
03:19:55,160 --> 03:19:57,160
Well anyways, so the music wasn't needed

3955
03:19:57,160 --> 03:19:58,160
to summon you after all.

3956
03:19:58,160 --> 03:20:00,160
Why'd I have to play it last time?

3957
03:20:00,160 --> 03:20:02,160
The circle is hard to find.

3958
03:20:02,160 --> 03:20:04,160
Sound is easy to follow.

3959
03:20:05,160 --> 03:20:07,160
Sound is easy to follow.

3960
03:20:07,160 --> 03:20:09,160
Are you starting to feel the pressure?

3961
03:20:09,160 --> 03:20:11,160
A little bit, yeah.

3962
03:20:11,160 --> 03:20:12,160
It's not...

3963
03:20:13,160 --> 03:20:15,160
It's not very low yet, but...

3964
03:20:17,160 --> 03:20:19,160
I think it's getting there.

3965
03:20:19,160 --> 03:20:21,160
It's gonna take me a little longer

3966
03:20:21,160 --> 03:20:23,160
to get there because, you know...

3967
03:20:25,160 --> 03:20:28,160
I already went to the bathroom not too long ago.

3968
03:20:30,160 --> 03:20:33,160
However you may have my talisman now.

3969
03:20:34,160 --> 03:20:36,160
Oh, you have my talisman.

3970
03:20:36,160 --> 03:20:38,160
However you have my talisman now,

3971
03:20:38,160 --> 03:20:40,160
it makes you easy to find.

3972
03:20:40,160 --> 03:20:42,160
Speaking of which,

3973
03:20:42,160 --> 03:20:44,160
a deal's a deal, charge it up please.

3974
03:20:45,160 --> 03:20:46,160
Your trinket works again.

3975
03:20:46,160 --> 03:20:47,160
Thank you.

3976
03:20:49,160 --> 03:20:50,160
What, hello?

3977
03:20:50,160 --> 03:20:51,160
This is the brother.

3978
03:20:51,160 --> 03:20:53,160
That's right, my pride and joy.

3979
03:20:55,160 --> 03:20:57,160
Oh no, you can't have his soul, it's mine.

3980
03:20:58,160 --> 03:21:00,160
I will see you again, Tar Soul.

3981
03:21:00,160 --> 03:21:02,160
Sure, I'll make another offer once the trinket

3982
03:21:02,160 --> 03:21:04,160
needs to be charged again.

3983
03:21:04,160 --> 03:21:05,160
I will summon you.

3984
03:21:05,160 --> 03:21:06,160
Bring this one with you.

3985
03:21:07,160 --> 03:21:08,160
What, why me?

3986
03:21:08,160 --> 03:21:09,160
Okie dokie, bye bye.

3987
03:21:13,160 --> 03:21:14,160
Not gonna lie,

3988
03:21:14,160 --> 03:21:15,160
I kind of feel bad seeing my little sister

3989
03:21:15,160 --> 03:21:16,160
do all these exercises.

3990
03:21:16,160 --> 03:21:18,160
You should do them with me.

3991
03:21:19,160 --> 03:21:21,160
You should participate with me.

3992
03:21:21,160 --> 03:21:22,160
What's that?

3993
03:21:22,160 --> 03:21:23,160
The trinket is charged.

3994
03:21:24,160 --> 03:21:25,160
What did it mean?

3995
03:21:25,160 --> 03:21:27,160
What did it mean it'll summon you?

3996
03:21:27,160 --> 03:21:28,160
Who cares?

3997
03:21:30,160 --> 03:21:31,160
Who cares?

3998
03:21:31,160 --> 03:21:33,160
What do we do about the bodies?

3999
03:21:33,160 --> 03:21:34,160
Who cares, she says.

4000
03:21:34,160 --> 03:21:35,160
Are you kidding me?

4001
03:21:35,160 --> 03:21:36,160
The bodies, Andy Focus.

4002
03:21:36,160 --> 03:21:37,160
Right, the bodies.

4003
03:21:39,160 --> 03:21:41,160
What's in it for me if I participate?

4004
03:21:42,160 --> 03:21:43,160
My love and affection.

4005
03:21:44,160 --> 03:21:45,160
And pain.

4006
03:21:45,160 --> 03:21:46,160
And maybe a little bit of pleasure.

4007
03:21:47,160 --> 03:21:48,160
Well, on one hand,

4008
03:21:48,160 --> 03:21:50,160
we didn't kill them.

4009
03:21:50,160 --> 03:21:51,160
But on the other,

4010
03:21:51,160 --> 03:21:53,160
them having gone missing

4011
03:21:53,160 --> 03:21:55,160
would definitely be better for us.

4012
03:21:55,160 --> 03:21:57,160
Maybe they just fucked off somewhere.

4013
03:21:57,160 --> 03:21:58,160
Who knows?

4014
03:21:58,160 --> 03:22:00,160
We know how if there's a murder investigation.

4015
03:22:00,160 --> 03:22:02,160
Right, so let's make them disappear.

4016
03:22:02,160 --> 03:22:04,160
Right, we can start by chopping them up.

4017
03:22:05,160 --> 03:22:07,160
Can't we just dump them in the ocean or something?

4018
03:22:07,160 --> 03:22:09,160
No, Ashley, we're gonna make them vanish.

4019
03:22:09,160 --> 03:22:11,160
Not wash up a shore somewhere.

4020
03:22:13,160 --> 03:22:14,160
Cut them up!

4021
03:22:15,160 --> 03:22:16,160
How to go about this,

4022
03:22:16,160 --> 03:22:17,160
we can't leave a mess behind.

4023
03:22:17,160 --> 03:22:19,160
Well, there's a dream right there.

4024
03:22:19,160 --> 03:22:20,160
Are you gay?

4025
03:22:20,160 --> 03:22:22,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4026
03:22:22,160 --> 03:22:25,160
We still doing jumping jacks with sips.

4027
03:22:25,160 --> 03:22:28,160
Need to keep Lil sis strong and agile to keep up.

4028
03:22:29,160 --> 03:22:30,160
I said no more.

4029
03:22:31,160 --> 03:22:32,160
I can't, I can't.

4030
03:22:33,160 --> 03:22:34,160
I'm sorry.

4031
03:22:35,160 --> 03:22:37,160
I'm sorry if you're expecting more.

4032
03:22:37,160 --> 03:22:38,160
I can't.

4033
03:22:39,160 --> 03:22:40,160
Flat twist is coming up.

4034
03:22:40,160 --> 03:22:42,160
Not like it changes much, but flat twist.

4035
03:22:44,160 --> 03:22:45,160
Okay.

4036
03:22:47,160 --> 03:22:48,160
Sounds like a good deal.

4037
03:22:48,160 --> 03:22:49,160
Okay, then participate with me.

4038
03:22:54,160 --> 03:22:56,160
Here, I'll do a big sip instead, yeah.

4039
03:22:59,160 --> 03:23:00,160
There.

4040
03:23:01,160 --> 03:23:03,160
See, I'm not a dumb ass all the time.

4041
03:23:03,160 --> 03:23:06,160
No, just a dumb and an ass.

4042
03:23:07,160 --> 03:23:09,160
Wow, check this smart ass out right here.

4043
03:23:10,160 --> 03:23:12,160
Andrew's untying the parents with stops.

4044
03:23:13,160 --> 03:23:14,160
Wait, what?

4045
03:23:14,160 --> 03:23:15,160
What is it?

4046
03:23:15,160 --> 03:23:16,160
Is dad breathing?

4047
03:23:16,160 --> 03:23:19,160
Dad never had a soul to begin with.

4048
03:23:20,160 --> 03:23:21,160
Maybe some sit-ups?

4049
03:23:21,160 --> 03:23:23,160
I can't even do sit-ups.

4050
03:23:26,160 --> 03:23:27,160
No more jacks, we can push your limits,

4051
03:23:27,160 --> 03:23:29,160
but not too extreme for extra sense.

4052
03:23:29,160 --> 03:23:30,160
Why are you so gay?

4053
03:23:30,160 --> 03:23:31,160
We'll do damage.

4054
03:23:31,160 --> 03:23:32,160
Yeah, we don't want to damage me.

4055
03:23:32,160 --> 03:23:35,160
Remember before we get lower that safe word exists for a reason.

4056
03:23:36,160 --> 03:23:39,160
Begging and pleading is just a precursor to the real joys.

4057
03:23:39,160 --> 03:23:42,160
Filling her with kindness by not being soft this time.

4058
03:23:45,160 --> 03:23:46,160
Push-ups?

4059
03:23:46,160 --> 03:23:48,160
I can't even do one push-up, man.

4060
03:23:49,160 --> 03:23:52,160
Take a look, and sure enough, his chest is moving ever so slightly.

4061
03:23:52,160 --> 03:23:53,160
Mom, too.

4062
03:23:54,160 --> 03:23:55,160
Huh?

4063
03:23:56,160 --> 03:23:58,160
You try various things, but nothing gets a response from your parents.

4064
03:23:58,160 --> 03:24:01,160
See, their hearts still beat, their lungs draw in air.

4065
03:24:02,160 --> 03:24:03,160
What is this?

4066
03:24:03,160 --> 03:24:05,160
Maybe losing your soul just turns you into a vegetable.

4067
03:24:07,160 --> 03:24:08,160
That can't be.

4068
03:24:08,160 --> 03:24:10,160
The cultists died in the warden, too.

4069
03:24:11,160 --> 03:24:12,160
Did you actually check?

4070
03:24:13,160 --> 03:24:14,160
I sure didn't.

4071
03:24:14,160 --> 03:24:16,160
I just went to town and started chopping.

4072
03:24:18,160 --> 03:24:20,160
Was mom Purgante?

4073
03:24:23,160 --> 03:24:26,160
No, no, please tell me he wasn't still alive when we ate him.

4074
03:24:27,160 --> 03:24:29,160
What the fuck is so funny about this?

4075
03:24:30,160 --> 03:24:32,160
Come on now, I'm sure he died pretty quickly from blood loss.

4076
03:24:33,160 --> 03:24:35,160
If not, you ripping his head off must have done the trick.

4077
03:24:37,160 --> 03:24:39,160
It'll be the same with these two, get to cutting.

4078
03:24:40,160 --> 03:24:42,160
No, this changes everything, doesn't it?

4079
03:24:43,160 --> 03:24:45,160
You want to leave them like this? They're not getting their souls back.

4080
03:24:46,160 --> 03:24:48,160
But if you want to leave them to starve them, they'll for it.

4081
03:24:49,160 --> 03:24:51,160
Wouldn't it be a little poetic? I'm sure you'd like that.

4082
03:24:54,160 --> 03:24:56,160
Squats is the appropriate exercise?

4083
03:24:57,160 --> 03:24:58,160
I can't.

4084
03:25:00,160 --> 03:25:01,160
I don't want to.

4085
03:25:02,160 --> 03:25:03,160
I really don't.

4086
03:25:04,160 --> 03:25:05,160
You can't make me.

4087
03:25:05,160 --> 03:25:06,160
You won't make me.

4088
03:25:08,160 --> 03:25:09,160
Wouldn't it be a little poetic?

4089
03:25:09,160 --> 03:25:10,160
I'm sure you'd like that.

4090
03:25:11,160 --> 03:25:12,160
I don't know, I need to think.

4091
03:25:13,160 --> 03:25:15,160
Come on, where are you going?

4092
03:25:16,160 --> 03:25:17,160
No, Andrew, look here for a sec.

4093
03:25:18,160 --> 03:25:19,160
What?

4094
03:25:21,160 --> 03:25:22,160
Oh shit.

4095
03:25:24,160 --> 03:25:28,160
The plot twist is that people getting their souls taken doesn't kill them.

4096
03:25:29,160 --> 03:25:30,160
Awww.

4097
03:25:31,160 --> 03:25:33,160
The cultist was alive when you ate him.

4098
03:25:33,160 --> 03:25:35,160
Awww.

4099
03:25:39,160 --> 03:25:40,160
What are you doing?

4100
03:25:41,160 --> 03:25:42,160
Bear, all dead.

4101
03:25:43,160 --> 03:25:47,160
Now tell me again how I always make you do all the dirty work.

4102
03:25:48,160 --> 03:25:49,160
He'll bitch and moan.

4103
03:25:50,160 --> 03:25:52,160
Surely he'll bitch and moan as per usual.

4104
03:25:53,160 --> 03:25:54,160
But you did not miss that sigh of relief.

4105
03:25:55,160 --> 03:25:58,160
Anyway, you drag your parents' souls and lifeless bodies over to the shower.

4106
03:26:01,160 --> 03:26:02,160
Oh my god.

4107
03:26:06,160 --> 03:26:08,160
The UK special, she shanked them.

4108
03:26:09,160 --> 03:26:11,160
What do we do now? Do we cut them up?

4109
03:26:12,160 --> 03:26:13,160
I'll start cutting.

4110
03:26:13,160 --> 03:26:15,160
You guide the blood into the drain with the shower head.

4111
03:26:15,160 --> 03:26:16,160
Gotcha.

4112
03:26:17,160 --> 03:26:19,160
Whoa, whoa, wait, stop. Stop, it's flooding.

4113
03:26:21,160 --> 03:26:22,160
What the hell, gross.

4114
03:26:23,160 --> 03:26:24,160
Are you gay?

4115
03:26:25,160 --> 03:26:26,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4116
03:26:27,160 --> 03:26:28,160
Sip, sip, sip.

4117
03:26:35,160 --> 03:26:36,160
How much for squats?

4118
03:26:38,160 --> 03:26:43,160
If I say how much then a bunch of people will make me do squats.

4119
03:26:43,160 --> 03:26:44,160
Squats.

4120
03:26:48,160 --> 03:26:49,160
Are you gay?

4121
03:26:50,160 --> 03:26:51,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4122
03:26:52,160 --> 03:26:53,160
Keep hanging in there.

4123
03:26:58,160 --> 03:26:59,160
Kind of a point.

4124
03:27:00,160 --> 03:27:01,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4125
03:27:02,160 --> 03:27:03,160
No one said you could stop.

4126
03:27:04,160 --> 03:27:05,160
Oh my god.

4127
03:27:06,160 --> 03:27:07,160
100 bucks a squat.

4128
03:27:13,160 --> 03:27:15,160
Don't give a number, no more exercise.

4129
03:27:19,160 --> 03:27:20,160
Are you gay?

4130
03:27:21,160 --> 03:27:22,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4131
03:27:22,160 --> 03:27:23,160
Oh my god.

4132
03:27:23,160 --> 03:27:24,160
I don't know now.

4133
03:27:26,160 --> 03:27:30,160
Yes, that's the point of exercising because it lowers my energy.

4134
03:27:31,160 --> 03:27:34,160
Okay, I can't do 20 squats.

4135
03:27:35,160 --> 03:27:36,160
Don't put a number on it.

4136
03:27:37,160 --> 03:27:40,160
So just as many squats as I can, what do you mean don't put a number on it?

4137
03:27:44,160 --> 03:27:45,160
Are you gay?

4138
03:27:46,160 --> 03:27:47,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4139
03:27:48,160 --> 03:27:49,160
Good girl.

4140
03:27:54,160 --> 03:27:55,160
Okay.

4141
03:27:56,160 --> 03:28:00,160
$20 for three squats there.

4142
03:28:01,160 --> 03:28:02,160
Are you gay?

4143
03:28:02,160 --> 03:28:03,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4144
03:28:04,160 --> 03:28:06,160
I'm cheering for you and also not at the same time.

4145
03:28:07,160 --> 03:28:08,160
Ocean wave, ocean wave.

4146
03:28:10,160 --> 03:28:11,160
$20 for three squats.

4147
03:28:11,160 --> 03:28:15,160
And I'm only doing a maximum of nine squats.

4148
03:28:16,160 --> 03:28:17,160
Okay?

4149
03:28:18,160 --> 03:28:20,160
Only doing a maximum of nine squats.

4150
03:28:23,160 --> 03:28:25,160
I'll get you something to unclog the drain with.

4151
03:28:26,160 --> 03:28:27,160
What?

4152
03:28:27,160 --> 03:28:28,160
Oh, the mop.

4153
03:28:29,160 --> 03:28:30,160
Are you gay?

4154
03:28:31,160 --> 03:28:32,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4155
03:28:33,160 --> 03:28:34,160
Okay.

4156
03:28:35,160 --> 03:28:37,160
Man, I haven't done squats in forever.

4157
03:28:38,160 --> 03:28:39,160
Shit.

4158
03:28:39,160 --> 03:28:40,160
Are you gay?

4159
03:28:41,160 --> 03:28:42,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4160
03:28:43,160 --> 03:28:45,160
Okay, six squats.

4161
03:28:47,160 --> 03:28:48,160
Okay.

4162
03:28:50,160 --> 03:28:51,160
One.

4163
03:28:52,160 --> 03:28:53,160
Two.

4164
03:28:54,160 --> 03:28:55,160
Three.

4165
03:28:57,160 --> 03:28:58,160
Four.

4166
03:28:59,160 --> 03:29:00,160
Oh, shit.

4167
03:29:01,160 --> 03:29:02,160
Five.

4168
03:29:04,160 --> 03:29:05,160
Six.

4169
03:29:06,160 --> 03:29:07,160
Okay.

4170
03:29:07,160 --> 03:29:08,160
Six.

4171
03:29:08,160 --> 03:29:09,160
Okay.

4172
03:29:20,160 --> 03:29:21,160
Oh, my God.

4173
03:29:27,160 --> 03:29:28,160
Oh, my God.

4174
03:29:38,160 --> 03:29:39,160
Okay.

4175
03:29:40,160 --> 03:29:41,160
Ask to grass?

4176
03:29:42,160 --> 03:29:43,160
I...

4177
03:29:45,160 --> 03:29:46,160
I can't.

4178
03:29:47,160 --> 03:29:48,160
I can't.

4179
03:29:48,160 --> 03:29:49,160
I can't go ask to grass.

4180
03:29:49,160 --> 03:29:50,160
I can't.

4181
03:29:51,160 --> 03:29:52,160
I can't go ask to grass.

4182
03:29:52,160 --> 03:29:53,160
I can't.

4183
03:29:53,160 --> 03:29:54,160
I can't go ask to grass.

4184
03:29:55,160 --> 03:29:56,160
I can't.

4185
03:29:56,160 --> 03:29:57,160
That's too much.

4186
03:29:58,160 --> 03:29:59,160
Okay.

4187
03:29:59,160 --> 03:30:01,160
How do I clean up all this blood?

4188
03:30:03,160 --> 03:30:04,160
Toilet?

4189
03:30:05,160 --> 03:30:06,160
Are you gay?

4190
03:30:07,160 --> 03:30:08,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4191
03:30:09,160 --> 03:30:10,160
Good job.

4192
03:30:10,160 --> 03:30:11,160
Oh, thank you.

4193
03:30:14,160 --> 03:30:17,160
Pour down some baking soda and vinegar.

4194
03:30:17,160 --> 03:30:18,160
Ah, screw.

4195
03:30:19,160 --> 03:30:20,160
Ah!

4196
03:30:21,160 --> 03:30:22,160
Okay.

4197
03:30:26,160 --> 03:30:27,160
Where do I...

4198
03:30:28,160 --> 03:30:29,160
Where do I find a screwdriver?

4199
03:30:29,160 --> 03:30:30,160
Mm-hmm.

4200
03:30:31,160 --> 03:30:32,160
Mm-hmm.

4201
03:30:32,160 --> 03:30:33,160
Mm-hmm.

4202
03:30:33,160 --> 03:30:34,160
Mm-hmm.

4203
03:30:35,160 --> 03:30:36,160
Mm-hmm.

4204
03:30:37,160 --> 03:30:39,160
Where do I find a screwdriver?

4205
03:30:41,160 --> 03:30:45,160
Where can I find a screwdriver?

4206
03:30:47,160 --> 03:30:48,160
Oh, in the basement.

4207
03:30:48,160 --> 03:30:49,160
In the basement.

4208
03:30:50,160 --> 03:30:52,160
In the basement.

4209
03:30:56,160 --> 03:30:58,160
Toolbox. Toolbox.

4210
03:30:59,160 --> 03:31:00,160
Hi.

4211
03:31:03,160 --> 03:31:04,160
Um, baking soda.

4212
03:31:04,160 --> 03:31:07,160
Baking soda is in the, in the, in the kitchen?

4213
03:31:07,160 --> 03:31:08,160
In the kitchen.

4214
03:31:09,160 --> 03:31:10,160
Am I winning?

4215
03:31:10,160 --> 03:31:11,160
Aren't you gay?

4216
03:31:11,160 --> 03:31:12,160
Mm-hmm.

4217
03:31:12,160 --> 03:31:13,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4218
03:31:13,160 --> 03:31:15,160
Feeling a little swollen.

4219
03:31:15,160 --> 03:31:16,160
Lil sis.

4220
03:31:16,160 --> 03:31:17,160
Last satilda.

4221
03:31:18,160 --> 03:31:20,160
Okay, last sat.

4222
03:31:20,160 --> 03:31:21,160
Are you gay?

4223
03:31:21,160 --> 03:31:23,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4224
03:31:23,160 --> 03:31:26,160
Hey, you're starting to sound a little flustered there.

4225
03:31:27,160 --> 03:31:28,160
Because I am!

4226
03:31:33,160 --> 03:31:34,160
One.

4227
03:31:35,160 --> 03:31:36,160
Two.

4228
03:31:38,160 --> 03:31:39,160
Three.

4229
03:31:40,160 --> 03:31:41,160
Okay.

4230
03:31:42,160 --> 03:31:44,160
There, we got nine squats in total.

4231
03:31:44,160 --> 03:31:45,160
You got what you wanted.

4232
03:31:47,160 --> 03:31:48,160
Ah.

4233
03:31:51,160 --> 03:31:52,160
Ah.

4234
03:31:53,160 --> 03:31:54,160
Ah.

4235
03:31:57,160 --> 03:31:58,160
Ah.

4236
03:32:03,160 --> 03:32:04,160
Ah.

4237
03:32:04,160 --> 03:32:05,160
Okay.

4238
03:32:07,160 --> 03:32:09,160
We're getting into very low tone.

4239
03:32:09,160 --> 03:32:11,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4240
03:32:11,160 --> 03:32:13,160
Gotta tone them cheeks.

4241
03:32:17,160 --> 03:32:19,160
My cheeks are already toned.

4242
03:32:19,160 --> 03:32:21,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4243
03:32:22,160 --> 03:32:24,160
How you holding up my lovely little sister?

4244
03:32:24,160 --> 03:32:26,160
You're acting so gay.

4245
03:32:26,160 --> 03:32:28,160
You're acting so gay.

4246
03:32:28,160 --> 03:32:29,160
You're acting so gay.

4247
03:32:29,160 --> 03:32:32,160
How you holding up my lovely little sister?

4248
03:32:34,160 --> 03:32:36,160
I'm holding up fine.

4249
03:32:36,160 --> 03:32:37,160
Are you gay?

4250
03:32:37,160 --> 03:32:39,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4251
03:32:39,160 --> 03:32:41,160
Cue timmy noise fund.

4252
03:32:45,160 --> 03:32:47,160
Punch them legs, I am!

4253
03:32:47,160 --> 03:32:48,160
I'm trying.

4254
03:32:48,160 --> 03:32:50,160
Kitchen, kitchen, we're going to the kitchen.

4255
03:32:50,160 --> 03:32:52,160
Fuck, that's not the kitchen.

4256
03:32:54,160 --> 03:32:55,160
Um.

4257
03:32:56,160 --> 03:32:58,160
Okay, baking soda, we got everything we need.

4258
03:33:00,160 --> 03:33:01,160
Ah.

4259
03:33:06,160 --> 03:33:08,160
Hey, are you gay?

4260
03:33:08,160 --> 03:33:10,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4261
03:33:10,160 --> 03:33:12,160
It's okay if you let out just a little.

4262
03:33:12,160 --> 03:33:14,160
No, no it's not.

4263
03:33:16,160 --> 03:33:18,160
Are you gay?

4264
03:33:18,160 --> 03:33:20,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4265
03:33:20,160 --> 03:33:22,160
It would be so easy to just give up.

4266
03:33:23,160 --> 03:33:26,160
No, I can't, I literally can't, I literally can't.

4267
03:33:30,160 --> 03:33:32,160
You pour down a generous amount of baking soda

4268
03:33:32,160 --> 03:33:34,160
and then don't, don't sit with vinegar.

4269
03:33:34,160 --> 03:33:37,160
The soda starts bubbling up and the clog doesn't

4270
03:33:37,160 --> 03:33:39,160
lessen one bit.

4271
03:33:39,160 --> 03:33:40,160
Oh, I tried.

4272
03:33:40,160 --> 03:33:42,160
I'll give you some rubber gloves.

4273
03:33:42,160 --> 03:33:44,160
I'm the one who's gonna have to get in there.

4274
03:33:44,160 --> 03:33:47,160
Oh, of course, I am but a dainty little lady.

4275
03:33:50,160 --> 03:33:52,160
You can't expect me to do a man's job.

4276
03:33:53,160 --> 03:33:55,160
Fine, just give me the gloves.

4277
03:33:56,160 --> 03:33:58,160
Where do I find those?

4278
03:33:59,160 --> 03:34:01,160
Are you gay?

4279
03:34:01,160 --> 03:34:03,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4280
03:34:03,160 --> 03:34:06,160
B.E.R.B., I have to house the bathroom sis.

4281
03:34:12,160 --> 03:34:14,160
I hope you fuckin'

4282
03:34:14,160 --> 03:34:18,160
trip and fall and land with your head in the toilet.

4283
03:34:19,160 --> 03:34:21,160
On the stairs.

4284
03:34:22,160 --> 03:34:24,160
Right, on the...

4285
03:34:26,160 --> 03:34:28,160
On the stairs.

4286
03:34:28,160 --> 03:34:30,160
I have fun.

4287
03:34:33,160 --> 03:34:36,160
God knows what out of the drain.

4288
03:34:36,160 --> 03:34:39,160
A seemingly never ending amount of God knows what.

4289
03:34:39,160 --> 03:34:42,160
It's disgusting, I'm gonna gag, you're not helping.

4290
03:34:42,160 --> 03:34:44,160
Fuck, that's gross, Andy.

4291
03:34:45,160 --> 03:34:49,160
Both of you took all of me about when I am armed.

4292
03:34:50,160 --> 03:34:52,160
Ew!

4293
03:34:55,160 --> 03:34:57,160
Come here, you.

4294
03:34:58,160 --> 03:35:00,160
No, no, no, don't you dare.

4295
03:35:00,160 --> 03:35:03,160
No, fuckin' kill you in your sleep in Minecraft.

4296
03:35:03,160 --> 03:35:05,160
Any last words?

4297
03:35:05,160 --> 03:35:08,160
Forgive me, Andrew, Andrew, I'm sorry, I apologize.

4298
03:35:08,160 --> 03:35:10,160
Find your spirit for now.

4299
03:35:10,160 --> 03:35:13,160
The drain works, let's get this over with.

4300
03:35:14,160 --> 03:35:18,160
And disembowel them and decapitate them.

4301
03:35:18,160 --> 03:35:21,160
And you also make mental note to yourself about Andrew.

4302
03:35:21,160 --> 03:35:26,160
Instead of oscillating between freaking out an apathy like you expected him to.

4303
03:35:29,160 --> 03:35:33,160
You're having a food fight, ew, it's not food.

4304
03:35:35,160 --> 03:35:37,160
Who is it?

4305
03:35:37,160 --> 03:35:38,160
What?

4306
03:35:39,160 --> 03:35:41,160
Nothing, Andrew.

4307
03:35:42,160 --> 03:35:45,160
If you're tired, I can take care of the rest.

4308
03:35:45,160 --> 03:35:47,160
No, no, it's really nothing.

4309
03:35:47,160 --> 03:35:49,160
I must be seeing things.

4310
03:35:49,160 --> 03:35:51,160
Huh? What?

4311
03:35:51,160 --> 03:35:52,160
To think...

4312
03:35:52,160 --> 03:35:57,160
To think I'd ever bear witness to you being distraught over our parents' crime.

4313
03:35:57,160 --> 03:36:02,160
Alright, and again, I bet you're just moping over finally getting your hands dirty.

4314
03:36:04,160 --> 03:36:08,160
She's still falling in love with him? Who? Me?

4315
03:36:08,160 --> 03:36:09,160
No?

4316
03:36:09,160 --> 03:36:13,160
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

4317
03:36:13,160 --> 03:36:17,160
Sorry I was gone, Emmy. God held up cleaning up after an incident.

4318
03:36:17,160 --> 03:36:21,160
You're just too cute. So how is round two going so far?

4319
03:36:22,160 --> 03:36:24,160
Thank you.

4320
03:36:24,160 --> 03:36:26,160
Thank you.

4321
03:36:26,160 --> 03:36:31,160
It's, um, going well, I think.

4322
03:36:32,160 --> 03:36:37,160
She isn't predicting Andrew, she's predicting Andy, and Andy is gone now fully.

4323
03:36:37,160 --> 03:36:41,160
So now only Andrew's in it and she doesn't know how to predict Andrew.

4324
03:36:41,160 --> 03:36:42,160
Huh?

4325
03:36:43,160 --> 03:36:46,160
Hm? What? Are you doing alright?

4326
03:36:46,160 --> 03:36:50,160
As alright as I can be considering the circumstances?

4327
03:36:51,160 --> 03:36:53,160
That's good.

4328
03:36:53,160 --> 03:36:56,160
You're being weird.

4329
03:36:56,160 --> 03:36:58,160
Look.

4330
03:37:01,160 --> 03:37:03,160
Okay.

4331
03:37:03,160 --> 03:37:05,160
Look who's talking.

4332
03:37:05,160 --> 03:37:08,160
Alright, enough time wasted.

4333
03:37:08,160 --> 03:37:11,160
Andrew continues casually butchering your parents.

4334
03:37:11,160 --> 03:37:13,160
Incidentally, there's a knot in your stomach.

4335
03:37:13,160 --> 03:37:15,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4336
03:37:15,160 --> 03:37:17,160
I think it's going a little too well.

4337
03:37:17,160 --> 03:37:19,160
What do you mean?

4338
03:37:24,160 --> 03:37:27,160
There's no such thing as too well.

4339
03:37:28,160 --> 03:37:29,160
Are you gay?

4340
03:37:29,160 --> 03:37:31,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4341
03:37:31,160 --> 03:37:33,160
Don't try this at home.

4342
03:37:33,160 --> 03:37:36,160
And by this I mean dismembering your parents.

4343
03:37:36,160 --> 03:37:39,160
Right, yes, yes, exactly.

4344
03:37:39,160 --> 03:37:42,160
Oh fuck, I ran out of water.

4345
03:37:45,160 --> 03:37:49,160
I don't want to stand up and make some worse.

4346
03:37:50,160 --> 03:37:52,160
Okay.

4347
03:37:53,160 --> 03:37:56,160
I'll be right back anymore, water.

4348
03:37:57,160 --> 03:37:58,160
Are you gay?

4349
03:37:58,160 --> 03:38:00,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4350
03:38:00,160 --> 03:38:05,160
Hey, Emmy, you're being weird, yellow heart.

4351
03:38:05,160 --> 03:38:07,160
I'm not being weird, you're being weird.

4352
03:38:07,160 --> 03:38:08,160
Are you gay?

4353
03:38:08,160 --> 03:38:10,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4354
03:38:10,160 --> 03:38:13,160
You make it sound easy, maybe you want another sip.

4355
03:38:13,160 --> 03:38:16,160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4356
03:38:16,160 --> 03:38:17,160
I'll be right back.

4357
03:38:17,160 --> 03:38:18,160
Are you gay?

4358
03:38:18,160 --> 03:38:21,160
Stop chipping.

4359
03:38:21,160 --> 03:38:23,160
You're going to need more water.

4360
03:38:48,160 --> 03:38:49,160
Are you gay?

4361
03:38:49,160 --> 03:38:51,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4362
03:38:51,160 --> 03:38:54,160
You make it sound easy, maybe you want another sip.

4363
03:38:54,160 --> 03:38:55,160
Are you gay?

4364
03:38:55,160 --> 03:38:57,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4365
03:38:57,160 --> 03:39:00,160
You make it sound easy, maybe you want another sip.

4366
03:39:00,160 --> 03:39:01,160
Are you gay?

4367
03:39:01,160 --> 03:39:03,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4368
03:39:03,160 --> 03:39:06,160
You make it sound easy, maybe you want another sip.

4369
03:39:06,160 --> 03:39:07,160
Are you gay?

4370
03:39:07,160 --> 03:39:09,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4371
03:39:09,160 --> 03:39:12,160
You make it sound easy, maybe you want another sip.

4372
03:39:12,160 --> 03:39:13,160
Are you gay?

4373
03:39:13,160 --> 03:39:15,160
Why are you acting so gay?

4374
03:39:16,160 --> 03:39:17,160
miserable

4375
03:39:26,160 --> 03:39:27,160
I'm sorry.

4376
03:39:27,160 --> 03:39:29,160
How much do I have to drink?

4377
03:39:35,160 --> 03:39:38,160
How much do I have to drink?

4378
03:39:41,160 --> 03:39:42,160

Can we leave?

4403
03:42:45,160 --> 03:42:48,120
You can cook your parents if you interact with the pot in the kitchen.

4404
03:42:49,400 --> 03:42:54,120
Let's turn some of the meat into a soup, throw in some vegetables, maybe spices,

4405
03:42:55,080 --> 03:42:57,960
and then throw the rest away as scraps. What do you mean the rest?

4406
03:42:59,080 --> 03:43:04,440
What do you think? I'm eating some. Do what you want. What was the soup you made earlier?

4407
03:43:05,240 --> 03:43:07,240
What are the ingredients again?

4408
03:43:11,000 --> 03:43:14,360
The recipe is right there, read it. Shame on me for...

4409
03:43:16,280 --> 03:43:18,120
Shame on me for thinking you'd be helpful.

4410
03:43:18,920 --> 03:43:22,520
It was me, Anya's Potatoes and Carrots, shop everything up and throw them into a pot.

4411
03:43:22,520 --> 03:43:24,520
There we go, thank you.

4412
03:43:24,520 --> 03:43:28,520
I know you memorized it, you fucking nerd.

4413
03:43:28,520 --> 03:43:30,520
I'm not letting go of anything.

4414
03:43:32,520 --> 03:43:34,520
You're welcome.

4415
03:43:38,520 --> 03:43:40,520
Do I have to...

4416
03:43:40,520 --> 03:43:42,520
How's the game so far?

4417
03:43:46,520 --> 03:43:48,520
That size is how it is.

4418
03:43:48,520 --> 03:43:50,520
How many water bottles?

4419
03:43:50,520 --> 03:43:52,520
I don't...

4420
03:43:56,520 --> 03:43:58,520
Fuck!

4421
03:44:00,520 --> 03:44:02,520
Are you gay?

4422
03:44:02,520 --> 03:44:04,520
Why are you acting so gay?

4423
03:44:04,520 --> 03:44:06,520
Drip, drip, drip.

4424
03:44:06,520 --> 03:44:08,520
Nothing is dripping.

4425
03:44:08,520 --> 03:44:10,520
Nothing, there's no drip.

4426
03:44:10,520 --> 03:44:12,520
Are you gay?

4427
03:44:12,520 --> 03:44:14,520
Why are you acting so gay?

4428
03:44:14,520 --> 03:44:16,520
Cheers.

4429
03:44:18,520 --> 03:44:20,520
Cheers.

4430
03:44:22,520 --> 03:44:26,520
For some reason my monitor keeps flickering.

4431
03:44:26,520 --> 03:44:28,520
What am I here for?

4432
03:44:28,520 --> 03:44:32,520
All I want is to cook my parents, right?

4433
03:44:32,520 --> 03:44:34,520
Are you gay?

4434
03:44:34,520 --> 03:44:36,520
Why are you acting so gay?

4435
03:44:36,520 --> 03:44:38,520
Gotta go to the bathroom real quick.

4436
03:44:38,520 --> 03:44:42,520
Be a good girl and hold it while I'm gone.

4437
03:44:44,520 --> 03:44:46,520
It's not fair!

4438
03:44:46,520 --> 03:44:48,520
It's not fair.

4439
03:44:48,520 --> 03:44:50,520
Why are you acting so gay?

4440
03:44:50,520 --> 03:44:54,520
You should get real close to the mic and let us hear you drink.

4441
03:44:54,520 --> 03:44:56,520
I am, but I don't think you can hear it.

4442
03:44:56,520 --> 03:44:58,520
Are you gay?

4443
03:44:58,520 --> 03:45:00,520
Why are you acting so gay?

4444
03:45:00,520 --> 03:45:02,520
Soup is mostly water.

4445
03:45:04,520 --> 03:45:06,520
I know it is.

4446
03:45:10,520 --> 03:45:14,520
This is kind of medically unadvisable, I know it is.

4447
03:45:14,520 --> 03:45:16,520
It's so gay.

4448
03:45:16,520 --> 03:45:18,520
What would happen if I poked your belly right now?

4449
03:45:22,520 --> 03:45:24,520
I don't want to think about that.

4450
03:45:24,520 --> 03:45:26,520
And you can't make me poke it myself, I won't do it.

4451
03:45:26,520 --> 03:45:28,520
Are you gay?

4452
03:45:28,520 --> 03:45:30,520
Why are you acting so gay?

4453
03:45:30,520 --> 03:45:34,520
An old army tip to help make drinking lots of water more tolerable.

4454
03:45:34,520 --> 03:45:36,520
Add some salt.

4455
03:45:36,520 --> 03:45:38,520
The body needs minerals along with the water.

4456
03:45:38,520 --> 03:45:40,520
You're already torturing me.

4457
03:45:40,520 --> 03:45:44,520
You want me to drink disgusting salt water too?

4458
03:45:44,520 --> 03:45:46,520
No.

4459
03:45:46,520 --> 03:45:48,520
Let me fix my monitor real quick.

4460
03:45:48,520 --> 03:45:50,520
It keeps flickering.

4461
03:46:10,520 --> 03:46:12,520
Okay.

4462
03:46:12,520 --> 03:46:14,520
You can just eat some street-up salt.

4463
03:46:14,520 --> 03:46:16,520
I don't think I'll do that.

4464
03:46:16,520 --> 03:46:20,520
But I did bring a sausage earlier from the kitchen.

4465
03:46:20,520 --> 03:46:22,520
Does that work?

4466
03:46:24,520 --> 03:46:26,520
I'm going to eat this sausage.

4467
03:46:26,520 --> 03:46:28,520
There.

4468
03:46:28,520 --> 03:46:30,520
Girl breakfast!

4469
03:46:32,520 --> 03:46:34,520
Okay.

4470
03:46:34,520 --> 03:46:36,520
You don't have all the ingredients prepared.

4471
03:46:36,520 --> 03:46:38,520
Where the fuck do I get the meat from?

4472
03:46:38,520 --> 03:46:40,520
I don't know.

4473
03:46:40,520 --> 03:46:42,520
I don't know.

4474
03:46:42,520 --> 03:46:44,520
I don't know.

4475
03:46:44,520 --> 03:46:46,520
I don't know.

4476
03:46:46,520 --> 03:46:48,520
I don't know.

4477
03:46:48,520 --> 03:46:50,520
I don't know.

4478
03:46:50,520 --> 03:46:52,520
I don't know.

4479
03:46:52,520 --> 03:46:54,520
I don't know.

4480
03:46:54,520 --> 03:46:56,520
Where the fuck do I get the meat from?

4481
03:46:58,520 --> 03:47:00,520
It is very salty.

4482
03:47:00,520 --> 03:47:02,520
I don't know what kind of sausage it is.

4483
03:47:02,520 --> 03:47:04,520
But it's my favorite.

4484
03:47:04,520 --> 03:47:06,520
It's really spicy.

4485
03:47:06,520 --> 03:47:08,520
And my mom gets it from the farmers market for me.

4486
03:47:18,520 --> 03:47:20,520
But their...

4487
03:47:20,520 --> 03:47:22,520
Their remains are in the fire cooking.

4488
03:47:24,520 --> 03:47:26,520
How do I get their remains?

4489
03:47:28,520 --> 03:47:30,520
I'm not gay.

4490
03:47:30,520 --> 03:47:32,520
Why are you acting so gay?

4491
03:47:32,520 --> 03:47:34,520
Evening, Jinji.

4492
03:47:34,520 --> 03:47:36,520
How you been, baby girl?

4493
03:47:36,520 --> 03:47:38,520
Jinji.

4494
03:47:38,520 --> 03:47:40,520
I can't say I'm not ginger.

4495
03:47:40,520 --> 03:47:42,520
I am ginger.

4496
03:47:46,520 --> 03:47:48,520
Did that scene happen yet?

4497
03:47:48,520 --> 03:47:50,520
What scene?

4498
03:47:50,520 --> 03:47:52,520
I don't know. Throw them in the fireplace?

4499
03:47:52,520 --> 03:47:54,520
What about the skulls?

4500
03:47:56,520 --> 03:47:58,520
The skulls we can deal with later along with the other skulls.

4501
03:48:04,520 --> 03:48:06,520
Look at that. Much better than your soup.

4502
03:48:06,520 --> 03:48:08,520
Now, was there anything else we still need to deal with?

4503
03:48:10,520 --> 03:48:12,520
I don't know.

4504
03:48:12,520 --> 03:48:14,520
She's my little ginger ale.

4505
03:48:14,520 --> 03:48:16,520
Aw, it's cute.

4506
03:48:16,520 --> 03:48:18,520
Throw your faces into the fire.

4507
03:48:18,520 --> 03:48:20,520
Wow, we had their faces.

4508
03:48:22,520 --> 03:48:24,520
I'm sorry to break it to anyone who's disappointed,

4509
03:48:24,520 --> 03:48:26,520
but unfortunately the concept artist

4510
03:48:26,520 --> 03:48:28,520
and Strani have both informed me

4511
03:48:28,520 --> 03:48:30,520
that I am supposed to be ginger.

4512
03:48:32,520 --> 03:48:34,520
Don't worry.

4513
03:48:34,520 --> 03:48:36,520
I'll make myself more obviously ginger.

4514
03:48:36,520 --> 03:48:38,520
When I draw my model.

4515
03:48:42,520 --> 03:48:44,520
I'm sorry to break it to anyone who's disappointed,

4516
03:48:44,520 --> 03:48:46,520
but unfortunately the concept artist

4517
03:48:46,520 --> 03:48:48,520
and Strani have both informed me

4518
03:48:48,520 --> 03:48:50,520
that I am supposed to be ginger.

4519
03:48:50,520 --> 03:48:52,520
I'm sorry to break it to anyone who's disappointed,

4520
03:48:52,520 --> 03:48:54,520
but unfortunately the concept artist and Strani have both informed me that I am supposed to be ginger.

4521
03:48:54,520 --> 03:48:56,520
I know it's so over. I have no soul.

4522
03:48:56,520 --> 03:48:58,520
Several servings of crimson smoothie emerge.

4523
03:48:58,520 --> 03:49:00,520
Several servings of crimson smoothie emerge.

4524
03:49:00,520 --> 03:49:02,520
All of which you fork down the fish and sink.

4525
03:49:02,520 --> 03:49:04,520
All of which you fork down the fish and sink.

4526
03:49:04,520 --> 03:49:06,520
How's that? Good as gone?

4527
03:49:06,520 --> 03:49:08,520
How's that? Good as gone?

4528
03:49:08,520 --> 03:49:10,520
I'm genuinely surprised you didn't offer me any.

4529
03:49:10,520 --> 03:49:12,520
I'm genuinely surprised you didn't offer me any.

4530
03:49:12,520 --> 03:49:14,520
Well, did you want a disease or something?

4531
03:49:14,520 --> 03:49:16,520
Of course.

4532
03:49:16,520 --> 03:49:18,520
Of course I wouldn't offer you raw meat.

4533
03:49:18,520 --> 03:49:20,520
You really take me for an idiot, don't you?

4534
03:49:22,520 --> 03:49:24,520
Is the sausage good?

4535
03:49:24,520 --> 03:49:26,520
Yes.

4536
03:49:32,520 --> 03:49:34,520
I take you for what you are, idiot.

4537
03:49:34,520 --> 03:49:36,520
Watch your mouth.

4538
03:49:36,520 --> 03:49:38,520
This idiot just poured your parents down the train.

4539
03:49:38,520 --> 03:49:40,520
Huh. Alright.

4540
03:49:40,520 --> 03:49:42,520
That was pretty smart, I guess, for an idiot.

4541
03:49:44,520 --> 03:49:46,520
What do I do?

4542
03:49:46,520 --> 03:49:48,520
What do I do?

4543
03:49:48,520 --> 03:49:50,520
Is it a big sausage?

4544
03:50:00,520 --> 03:50:02,520
Sorry, I choked on it a little.

4545
03:50:02,520 --> 03:50:04,520
It is a big sausage and it's really spicy too.

4546
03:50:04,520 --> 03:50:06,520
So it hurts to eat.

4547
03:50:08,520 --> 03:50:10,520
The bones, the bones, the bones.

4548
03:50:10,520 --> 03:50:12,520
The bones.

4549
03:50:14,520 --> 03:50:16,520
The bones, what do I do with the bones?

4550
03:50:18,520 --> 03:50:20,520
Do you think the soup is ready?

4551
03:50:24,520 --> 03:50:26,520
What do I do with the bones?

4552
03:50:30,520 --> 03:50:32,520
What do I do with the bones?

4553
03:50:34,520 --> 03:50:36,520
How many inches?

4554
03:50:36,520 --> 03:50:38,520
It's like three inches.

4555
03:50:38,520 --> 03:50:40,520
Why are you acting so gay?

4556
03:50:40,520 --> 03:50:42,520
Why are you acting so gay?

4557
03:50:42,520 --> 03:50:44,520
Can't have you choking.

4558
03:50:44,520 --> 03:50:46,520
Better wash it down.

4559
03:50:50,520 --> 03:50:52,520
Dinner's ready.

4560
03:50:52,520 --> 03:50:54,520
I'm eating too.

4561
03:50:54,520 --> 03:50:56,520
Of course, this is the last hearty home cooked meal for a while after all.

4562
03:50:56,520 --> 03:50:58,520
I suppose that's right now.

4563
03:50:58,520 --> 03:51:00,520
Why are you acting so gay?

4564
03:51:04,520 --> 03:51:06,520
I don't know.

4565
03:51:06,520 --> 03:51:08,520
Can you eat closer to the mic?

4566
03:51:10,520 --> 03:51:12,520
The mic is right in front of my mouth.

4567
03:51:12,520 --> 03:51:14,520
It's always in front of my mouth.

4568
03:51:16,520 --> 03:51:18,520
It's probably just not sensitive enough to hear.

4569
03:51:22,520 --> 03:51:24,520
Yeah.

4570
03:51:24,520 --> 03:51:26,520
Maybe if I turned off the mic settings.

4571
03:51:30,520 --> 03:51:32,520
There.

4572
03:51:32,520 --> 03:51:34,520
Is that what you wanted?

4573
03:51:44,520 --> 03:51:46,520
Okay, I turned the mic settings back on.

4574
03:51:50,520 --> 03:51:52,520
How is it?

4575
03:51:52,520 --> 03:51:54,520
It's okay.

4576
03:51:58,520 --> 03:52:00,520
Just okay?

4577
03:52:02,520 --> 03:52:04,520
I mean, it's better than last night, but...

4578
03:52:04,520 --> 03:52:06,520
Why are you so picky?

4579
03:52:06,520 --> 03:52:08,520
It's really dry. You overcooked it or something.

4580
03:52:08,520 --> 03:52:10,520
Mom's just a dry person, alright?

4581
03:52:10,520 --> 03:52:12,520
Are you gay?

4582
03:52:12,520 --> 03:52:14,520
Why are you acting so gay?

4583
03:52:14,520 --> 03:52:16,520
Do you miss being able to look at our Twitter likes?

4584
03:52:16,520 --> 03:52:18,520
I do.

4585
03:52:18,520 --> 03:52:20,520
I do.

4586
03:52:20,520 --> 03:52:22,520
It kind of, you know, told me what kind of person you are.

4587
03:52:24,520 --> 03:52:26,520
And the stuff you like.

4588
03:52:26,520 --> 03:52:28,520
I don't chew with my mouth open.

4589
03:52:28,520 --> 03:52:30,520
It's just the model tracking thinks my mouth is open.

4590
03:52:36,520 --> 03:52:38,520
How the hell is it dry?

4591
03:52:38,520 --> 03:52:40,520
This is soup.

4592
03:52:40,520 --> 03:52:42,520
No, mom should be more salty.

4593
03:52:42,520 --> 03:52:44,520
This is just plain and dry.

4594
03:52:44,520 --> 03:52:46,520
I rate this a waste of ingredients out of 10.

4595
03:52:46,520 --> 03:52:48,520
We're not eating again.

4596
03:52:56,520 --> 03:52:58,520
If the water continues,

4597
03:52:58,520 --> 03:53:00,520
don't neglect sodium salty food will do.

4598
03:53:00,520 --> 03:53:02,520
Yeah, that's why I'm eating a sausage.

4599
03:53:06,520 --> 03:53:08,520
I will slay away in the kitchen for you.

4600
03:53:08,520 --> 03:53:10,520
This is the things I get.

4601
03:53:10,520 --> 03:53:12,520
I'm sorry you can't cook.

4602
03:53:12,520 --> 03:53:14,520
You're not forgiven.

4603
03:53:14,520 --> 03:53:16,520
Jackass!

4604
03:53:16,520 --> 03:53:18,520
Eat shit and die.

4605
03:53:22,520 --> 03:53:24,520
Come on, I'm joking. It's not that bad. It's fine.

4606
03:53:24,520 --> 03:53:26,520
More than fine.

4607
03:53:28,520 --> 03:53:30,520
Okay, I'm going to stop eating the sausage for a bit.

4608
03:53:40,520 --> 03:53:42,520
I'm trying to like...

4609
03:53:42,520 --> 03:53:44,520
I shouldn't describe anything I'm doing.

4610
03:53:54,520 --> 03:53:56,520
No, I'm not going to describe anything I'm doing.

4611
03:53:56,520 --> 03:53:58,520
I can't.

4612
03:53:58,520 --> 03:54:00,520
I just...

4613
03:54:00,520 --> 03:54:02,520
Okay.

4614
03:54:06,520 --> 03:54:08,520
Okay, okay, okay.

4615
03:54:08,520 --> 03:54:10,520
Yes, yes, it's fantastic.

4616
03:54:10,520 --> 03:54:12,520
In a way, my dumb ass can appreciate.

4617
03:54:12,520 --> 03:54:14,520
How about that?

4618
03:54:16,520 --> 03:54:18,520
Yes, indeed, this cooking is beyond

4619
03:54:18,520 --> 03:54:20,520
my mortal comprehension.

4620
03:54:20,520 --> 03:54:22,520
Correct?

4621
03:54:22,520 --> 03:54:24,520
Out of this world culinary experience,

4622
03:54:24,520 --> 03:54:26,520
which the likes of me cannot even taste properly.

4623
03:54:26,520 --> 03:54:28,520
Because my taste buds simply aren't evolved enough

4624
03:54:28,520 --> 03:54:30,520
to sense all the subtleties.

4625
03:54:30,520 --> 03:54:32,520
I'm not explaining anything to the class.

4626
03:54:32,520 --> 03:54:34,520
In a roundabout way.

4627
03:54:40,520 --> 03:54:42,520
I'm eating a sausage, that's what I'm doing.

4628
03:54:48,520 --> 03:54:50,520
I'm chewing on the sausage, that's what I'm up to.

4629
03:54:52,520 --> 03:54:54,520
So this calorie should only reflect the kings.

4630
03:54:54,520 --> 03:54:56,520
No, gods!

4631
03:54:56,520 --> 03:54:58,520
That's more like it.

4632
03:54:58,520 --> 03:55:00,520
So exquisite is your cooking.

4633
03:55:00,520 --> 03:55:02,520
But I'll write a shitty poem about it.

4634
03:55:02,520 --> 03:55:04,520
Oh god.

4635
03:55:14,520 --> 03:55:16,520
Lo and behold I implore you

4636
03:55:16,520 --> 03:55:18,520
Come feast your eyes on her.

4637
03:55:18,520 --> 03:55:20,520

It's spicy, you better drink some water then.

Oh my God.

4670
03:58:58,280 --> 03:59:00,280
How much of the bottle is left?

4671
03:59:01,280 --> 03:59:03,280
Like, more than half?

4672
03:59:06,280 --> 03:59:07,280
I don't want to end.

4673
03:59:07,280 --> 03:59:09,280
I mean, I don't want to go.

4674
03:59:09,280 --> 03:59:11,280
I don't want to go. I want to keep going.

4675
03:59:11,280 --> 03:59:13,280
Are you talking to yourself right now?

4676
03:59:13,280 --> 03:59:14,280
You're right.

4677
03:59:14,280 --> 03:59:15,280
What was I thinking?

4678
03:59:15,280 --> 03:59:18,280
You wouldn't even worry if I told you to.

4679
03:59:18,280 --> 03:59:19,280
What?

4680
03:59:19,280 --> 03:59:21,280
Your inability to...

4681
03:59:27,280 --> 03:59:29,280
Was that hot?

4682
03:59:30,280 --> 03:59:31,280
Oh God.

4683
03:59:31,280 --> 03:59:32,280
Are you gay?

4684
03:59:32,280 --> 03:59:33,280
Oh, please.

4685
03:59:33,280 --> 03:59:35,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4686
03:59:35,280 --> 03:59:36,280
More than half?

4687
03:59:36,280 --> 03:59:38,280
We need to fix that.

4688
03:59:38,280 --> 03:59:42,280
Your inability to grasp the weight of the situation is simultaneous.

4689
03:59:42,280 --> 03:59:44,280
Your best and worst quality.

4690
03:59:44,280 --> 03:59:46,280
I've really come to appreciate it.

4691
03:59:46,280 --> 03:59:50,280
Though it pisses me off all the same.

4692
03:59:50,280 --> 03:59:51,280
Thank you.

4693
03:59:52,280 --> 03:59:53,280
You're gay?

4694
03:59:53,280 --> 03:59:54,280
Oh my God.

4695
03:59:54,280 --> 03:59:56,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4696
03:59:56,280 --> 04:00:00,280
Try tapping a few inches below your belly button should holding it in.

4697
04:00:00,280 --> 04:00:01,280
Okay.

4698
04:00:02,280 --> 04:00:04,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4699
04:00:04,280 --> 04:00:08,280
Try tapping a few inches below your belly button should holding it in.

4700
04:00:08,280 --> 04:00:09,280
No.

4701
04:00:11,280 --> 04:00:12,280
No.

4702
04:00:12,280 --> 04:00:13,280
I'm not doing that.

4703
04:00:13,280 --> 04:00:14,280
I'm not stupid.

4704
04:00:18,280 --> 04:00:19,280
I'm not stupid.

4705
04:00:25,280 --> 04:00:28,280
I just chose to ignore your knots.

4706
04:00:29,280 --> 04:00:30,280
Are you gay?

4707
04:00:30,280 --> 04:00:32,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4708
04:00:32,280 --> 04:00:34,280
Give it a little press.

4709
04:00:42,280 --> 04:00:44,280
I don't want to.

4710
04:00:45,280 --> 04:00:46,280
You can't make me.

4711
04:00:46,280 --> 04:00:47,280
I'm not doing that.

4712
04:00:48,280 --> 04:00:49,280
No.

4713
04:00:51,280 --> 04:00:53,280
It should be fine just to chuck.

4714
04:00:53,280 --> 04:00:55,280
Press for 30?

4715
04:00:57,280 --> 04:00:59,280
Okay press for 30.

4716
04:00:59,280 --> 04:01:00,280
Just one!

4717
04:01:01,280 --> 04:01:03,280
It should be fine to just...

4718
04:01:03,280 --> 04:01:04,280
Are you gay?

4719
04:01:04,280 --> 04:01:06,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4720
04:01:06,280 --> 04:01:07,280
Don't be a bad girl.

4721
04:01:07,280 --> 04:01:08,280
Ah!

4722
04:01:10,280 --> 04:01:11,280
I don't care.

4723
04:01:12,280 --> 04:01:13,280
If it makes me...

4724
04:01:13,280 --> 04:01:14,280
Are you gay?

4725
04:01:14,280 --> 04:01:16,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4726
04:01:16,280 --> 04:01:18,280
Don't be a bad girl.

4727
04:01:18,280 --> 04:01:19,280
Ah!

4728
04:01:21,280 --> 04:01:22,280
I don't care.

4729
04:01:23,280 --> 04:01:25,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4730
04:01:25,280 --> 04:01:27,280
Just push a bit see what happens.

4731
04:01:27,280 --> 04:01:28,280
No.

4732
04:01:29,280 --> 04:01:30,280
No.

4733
04:01:30,280 --> 04:01:31,280
No.

4734
04:01:37,280 --> 04:01:38,280
No.

4735
04:01:38,280 --> 04:01:39,280
No.

4736
04:01:43,280 --> 04:01:44,280
No.

4737
04:01:44,280 --> 04:01:49,280
It should be fine to just chuck this into the trash bin outside, right?

4738
04:01:50,280 --> 04:01:51,280
Okay.

4739
04:01:54,280 --> 04:01:55,280
Are you gay?

4740
04:01:55,280 --> 04:01:57,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4741
04:01:57,280 --> 04:01:58,280
Press.

4742
04:02:01,280 --> 04:02:02,280
Okay.

4743
04:02:03,280 --> 04:02:04,280
Oh my god.

4744
04:02:10,280 --> 04:02:11,280
Okay okay okay I did it.

4745
04:02:11,280 --> 04:02:12,280
I did it.

4746
04:02:12,280 --> 04:02:13,280
I did it.

4747
04:02:14,280 --> 04:02:15,280
I hate you.

4748
04:02:15,280 --> 04:02:16,280
I hate you.

4749
04:02:18,280 --> 04:02:19,280
Okay.

4750
04:02:24,280 --> 04:02:25,280
Okay.

4751
04:02:26,280 --> 04:02:29,280
I wanna do a pose.

4752
04:02:35,280 --> 04:02:37,280
How do I do it?

4753
04:02:54,280 --> 04:02:55,280
Ow!

4754
04:02:56,280 --> 04:02:57,280
Fuck, that was a...

4755
04:02:57,280 --> 04:02:59,280
That was a rough cough.

4756
04:03:01,280 --> 04:03:02,280
Why does nothing...

4757
04:03:03,280 --> 04:03:05,280
Why is 80% saying no?

4758
04:03:05,280 --> 04:03:06,280
It wasn't this bad last time.

4759
04:03:06,280 --> 04:03:07,280
Are you gay?

4760
04:03:07,280 --> 04:03:09,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4761
04:03:09,280 --> 04:03:11,280
Don't give an early this time chat.

4762
04:03:18,280 --> 04:03:19,280
Ow!

4763
04:03:21,280 --> 04:03:22,280
Oh my god.

4764
04:03:24,280 --> 04:03:25,280
Are you gay?

4765
04:03:25,280 --> 04:03:27,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4766
04:03:27,280 --> 04:03:28,280
Too bad.

4767
04:03:28,280 --> 04:03:29,280
Not so soon.

4768
04:03:30,280 --> 04:03:31,280
Fuck.

4769
04:03:32,280 --> 04:03:33,280
Fuck you.

4770
04:03:34,280 --> 04:03:35,280
Are you gay?

4771
04:03:35,280 --> 04:03:37,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4772
04:03:37,280 --> 04:03:40,280
You don't seem like you really want to go.

4773
04:03:41,280 --> 04:03:43,280
But I do.

4774
04:03:44,280 --> 04:03:45,280
Are you gay?

4775
04:03:45,280 --> 04:03:46,280
Oh my god.

4776
04:03:46,280 --> 04:03:47,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4777
04:03:48,280 --> 04:03:50,280
Sounds like you need some more sips.

4778
04:03:50,280 --> 04:03:51,280
Hope you don't leak.

4779
04:03:54,280 --> 04:03:55,280
Are you gay?

4780
04:03:55,280 --> 04:03:57,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4781
04:03:57,280 --> 04:03:58,280
You're a big girl.

4782
04:03:58,280 --> 04:03:59,280
You can take it.

4783
04:04:01,280 --> 04:04:02,280
Are you gay?

4784
04:04:02,280 --> 04:04:03,280
Oh my god.

4785
04:04:03,280 --> 04:04:04,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4786
04:04:04,280 --> 04:04:05,280
Drink up, cutie.

4787
04:04:05,280 --> 04:04:06,280
Orange heart.

4788
04:04:07,280 --> 04:04:08,280
Are you gay?

4789
04:04:08,280 --> 04:04:09,280
Oh my god.

4790
04:04:09,280 --> 04:04:11,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4791
04:04:11,280 --> 04:04:12,280
Drink up, cutie.

4792
04:04:12,280 --> 04:04:13,280
Orange heart.

4793
04:04:22,280 --> 04:04:23,280
Okay.

4794
04:04:24,280 --> 04:04:25,280
Okay.

4795
04:04:28,280 --> 04:04:29,280
Can we go now?

4796
04:04:29,280 --> 04:04:30,280
Should we go?

4797
04:04:31,280 --> 04:04:32,280
Can we?

4798
04:04:32,280 --> 04:04:33,280
Are you gay?

4799
04:04:33,280 --> 04:04:35,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4800
04:04:35,280 --> 04:04:38,280
Almost seems like you shouldn't have talked all that shit earlier.

4801
04:04:40,280 --> 04:04:42,280
I stand by what I said.

4802
04:04:46,280 --> 04:04:47,280
Are you gay?

4803
04:04:47,280 --> 04:04:49,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4804
04:04:50,280 --> 04:04:55,280
I don't know it looks like you could hold out a lot longer and plus you have your puppy pad there with you love you and me.

4805
04:04:56,280 --> 04:04:57,280
Are you gay?

4806
04:04:57,280 --> 04:04:59,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4807
04:05:00,280 --> 04:05:04,280
Remember chat, there is still another energy level and a safe word we can reach.

4808
04:05:05,280 --> 04:05:06,280
Hold the line.

4809
04:05:08,280 --> 04:05:09,280
You won't.

4810
04:05:09,280 --> 04:05:10,280
We're not getting there.

4811
04:05:10,280 --> 04:05:12,280
We're not getting to the next level.

4812
04:05:15,280 --> 04:05:17,280
Can you help me in the game?

4813
04:05:17,280 --> 04:05:19,280
I don't know what else.

4814
04:05:19,280 --> 04:05:20,280
Are you gay?

4815
04:05:20,280 --> 04:05:22,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4816
04:05:22,280 --> 04:05:26,280
Remember chat, we have safe words and she mocked us for giving in.

4817
04:05:26,280 --> 04:05:28,280
I want to push her to her limits.

4818
04:05:28,280 --> 04:05:31,280
Hearing her cutely beg and complain makes my day.

4819
04:05:36,280 --> 04:05:38,280
Oh my god.

4820
04:05:40,280 --> 04:05:43,280
I need to figure out what to do with the bones.

4821
04:05:47,280 --> 04:05:51,280
For now, I'll just collect them all before Ashley distract.

4822
04:05:57,280 --> 04:05:58,280
Okay.

4823
04:06:01,280 --> 04:06:02,280
What do I do with them?

4824
04:06:03,280 --> 04:06:05,280
Are you gay?

4825
04:06:05,280 --> 04:06:07,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4826
04:06:08,280 --> 04:06:12,280
Don't worry, we'll let you go when the game is over shouldn't be more than 30 minutes.

4827
04:06:13,280 --> 04:06:16,280
The game isn't finished in 30 minutes, is it?

4828
04:06:16,280 --> 04:06:17,280
Ow!

4829
04:06:17,280 --> 04:06:18,280
Is it?

4830
04:06:29,280 --> 04:06:31,280
The game is done in 30 minutes?

4831
04:06:32,280 --> 04:06:33,280
Really?

4832
04:06:34,280 --> 04:06:36,280
Wait, so what do I do now?

4833
04:06:40,280 --> 04:06:43,280
Wait, there's only two chapters right now?

4834
04:06:43,280 --> 04:06:45,280
Wait, is the game not done?

4835
04:06:46,280 --> 04:06:48,280
Is the game not done?

4836
04:06:49,280 --> 04:06:51,280
I do lack critical information.

4837
04:06:52,280 --> 04:06:53,280
Are you gay?

4838
04:06:53,280 --> 04:06:55,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4839
04:06:56,280 --> 04:06:58,280
Sounds like we need to hurry this up.

4840
04:06:59,280 --> 04:07:01,280
It's still being...

4841
04:07:04,280 --> 04:07:06,280
Okay, are you gay?

4842
04:07:06,280 --> 04:07:08,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4843
04:07:08,280 --> 04:07:11,280
Get those drinks in before the game is over.

4844
04:07:11,280 --> 04:07:12,280
I'm trying!

4845
04:07:17,280 --> 04:07:20,280
Can you tell me what to do next?

4846
04:07:20,280 --> 04:07:21,280
Are you gay?

4847
04:07:21,280 --> 04:07:23,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4848
04:07:23,280 --> 04:07:25,280
You can do it.

4849
04:07:25,280 --> 04:07:28,280
Even though it probably seems like it would feel really good to let go.

4850
04:07:34,280 --> 04:07:37,280
So what about these skulls?

4851
04:07:37,280 --> 04:07:39,280
I'm thinking of throwing those into the...

4852
04:07:40,280 --> 04:07:41,280
Into the...

4853
04:07:46,280 --> 04:07:49,280
Into the ocean along with the rest of the bones.

4854
04:07:50,280 --> 04:07:52,280
So much for making them a bit...

4855
04:07:52,280 --> 04:07:54,280
Oh my god, I can't!

4856
04:07:55,280 --> 04:07:56,280
Oh fuck!

4857
04:07:57,280 --> 04:07:59,280
So much for making them disappear, huh?

4858
04:08:01,280 --> 04:08:02,280
Are you gay?

4859
04:08:02,280 --> 04:08:04,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4860
04:08:05,280 --> 04:08:08,280
Think about how good you would feel to leak out just a tiny bit.

4861
04:08:08,280 --> 04:08:09,280
I can't!

4862
04:08:09,280 --> 04:08:10,280
Even if I want to...

4863
04:08:10,280 --> 04:08:12,280
Well, maybe I can try, hold on.

4864
04:08:13,280 --> 04:08:14,280
No, I can't.

4865
04:08:14,280 --> 04:08:17,280
Even if I want to, I can't.

4866
04:08:17,280 --> 04:08:19,280
I literally...

4867
04:08:19,280 --> 04:08:21,280
I literally can't.

4868
04:08:22,280 --> 04:08:25,280
You're not allowed to, it doesn't matter.

4869
04:08:25,280 --> 04:08:26,280
I can't.

4870
04:08:31,280 --> 04:08:32,280
So much for...

4871
04:08:32,280 --> 04:08:33,280
Are you gay?

4872
04:08:33,280 --> 04:08:34,280
Oh my god.

4873
04:08:34,280 --> 04:08:36,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4874
04:08:36,280 --> 04:08:37,280
Try again.

4875
04:08:42,280 --> 04:08:43,280
No.

4876
04:08:44,280 --> 04:08:45,280
No, I can't.

4877
04:08:45,280 --> 04:08:46,280
No, I can't.

4878
04:08:50,280 --> 04:08:52,280
So much for making them disappear, huh?

4879
04:08:52,280 --> 04:08:54,280
What did we do all this other crap for?

4880
04:08:55,280 --> 04:08:56,280
I should...

4881
04:08:58,280 --> 04:08:59,280
Hold on.

4882
04:09:01,280 --> 04:09:03,280
I just want to check something real quick.

4883
04:09:03,280 --> 04:09:04,280
Hold on.

4884
04:09:06,280 --> 04:09:08,280
Oh shit, I have the wrong...

4885
04:09:09,280 --> 04:09:11,280
Dammit!

4886
04:09:13,280 --> 04:09:14,280
Are you gay?

4887
04:09:14,280 --> 04:09:16,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4888
04:09:17,280 --> 04:09:19,280
That's it, open your mouth and drink.

4889
04:09:21,280 --> 04:09:22,280
Don't say that!

4890
04:09:22,280 --> 04:09:23,280
Don't say that here!

4891
04:09:27,280 --> 04:09:29,280
Okay, okay, okay.

4892
04:09:29,280 --> 04:09:30,280
Are you gay?

4893
04:09:30,280 --> 04:09:32,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4894
04:09:32,280 --> 04:09:34,280
Make sure you breathe.

4895
04:09:34,280 --> 04:09:35,280
Think of a happy place.

4896
04:09:35,280 --> 04:09:38,280
Like a waterfall, gushing water everywhere.

4897
04:09:39,280 --> 04:09:40,280
Stop!

4898
04:09:40,280 --> 04:09:42,280
Please, please, are you gay?

4899
04:09:42,280 --> 04:09:44,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4900
04:09:45,280 --> 04:09:47,280
I know you can do it, Amy.

4901
04:09:47,280 --> 04:09:48,280
You're a good girl.

4902
04:09:57,280 --> 04:10:00,280
I'm hoping one can't identify someone based on their bones alone.

4903
04:10:00,280 --> 04:10:01,280
The bones float?

4904
04:10:01,280 --> 04:10:03,280
Aren't they kinda like sticks?

4905
04:10:03,280 --> 04:10:05,280
I'll find someone to weigh them...

4906
04:10:05,280 --> 04:10:06,280
Fuck.

4907
04:10:10,280 --> 04:10:11,280
Gay?

4908
04:10:11,280 --> 04:10:13,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4909
04:10:13,280 --> 04:10:14,280
Please.

4910
04:10:20,280 --> 04:10:21,280
Are you gay?

4911
04:10:21,280 --> 04:10:23,280
Why are you acting so gay?

4912
04:10:24,280 --> 04:10:26,280
Just close your eyes and lean back.

4913
04:10:26,280 --> 04:10:27,280
Relax, baby.

4914
04:10:27,280 --> 04:10:28,280
No!

4915
04:10:28,280 --> 04:10:29,280
No!

4916
04:10:29,280 --> 04:10:30,280
No!

4917
04:10:30,280 --> 04:10:32,280
I'm doing another...

4918
04:10:42,280 --> 04:10:43,280
Please.

4919
04:10:44,280 --> 04:10:45,280
Please!

4920
04:10:46,280 --> 04:10:48,280
Please, please, can I go please?

4921
04:10:49,280 --> 04:10:51,280
Why are you saying no?

4922
04:10:54,280 --> 04:10:55,280
Please.

4923
04:10:57,280 --> 04:10:58,280
Please.

4924
04:11:00,280 --> 04:11:01,280
Please.

4925
04:11:04,280 --> 04:11:05,280
Are you gay?

4926

4929

4934
04:11:26,280 --> 04:11:29,280
You're making me angry, I don't want to!

4935
04:11:29,280 --> 04:11:30,280
Are you gay?

4936
04:11:30,280 --> 04:11:31,280

Why are you acting so gay?

4938

5029
04:18:03,860 --> 04:18:04,860

04:18:34,860 --> 04:18:36,860
Why are you acting so gay?

5045
04:18:36,860 --> 04:18:38,860
Normies and children out.

5046
04:18:38,860 --> 04:18:41,860
Stop complaining and saying it's weird.

5047
04:18:41,860 --> 04:18:43,860
Dude, I don't even know where my phone is.

5048
04:18:43,860 --> 04:18:44,860
Are you gay?

5049
04:18:44,860 --> 04:18:46,860
Why are you acting so gay?

5050
04:18:46,860 --> 04:18:48,860
Now, beg for it.

5051
04:18:48,860 --> 04:18:50,860
Oh, fuck you.

5052
04:18:52,860 --> 04:18:53,860
I'm trying to turn on my phone

5053
04:18:53,860 --> 04:18:56,860
so I can literally record what you want.

5054
04:19:01,860 --> 04:19:02,860
Come on.

5055
04:19:02,860 --> 04:19:03,860
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

5056
04:19:03,860 --> 04:19:04,860
My phone is ready.

5057
04:19:04,860 --> 04:19:05,860
Please.

5058
04:19:05,860 --> 04:19:07,860
Why are you acting so gay?

5059
04:19:07,860 --> 04:19:09,860
I want you to have an accident.

5060
04:19:09,860 --> 04:19:10,860
No!

5061
04:19:12,860 --> 04:19:13,860
Please.

5062
04:19:13,860 --> 04:19:14,860
I'm giving you what you want.

5063
04:19:14,860 --> 04:19:15,860
Please, please.

5064
04:19:19,860 --> 04:19:21,860
Please.

5065
04:19:22,860 --> 04:19:24,860
I can't even drink anymore.

5066
04:19:24,860 --> 04:19:25,860
Where I can't.

5067
04:19:25,860 --> 04:19:27,860
Oh my god.

5068
04:19:27,860 --> 04:19:29,860
Why is the pulse so...

5069
04:19:33,860 --> 04:19:35,860
Why is the pulse so...

5070
04:19:36,860 --> 04:19:38,860
Please.

5071
04:19:40,860 --> 04:19:41,860
Chat.

5072
04:19:41,860 --> 04:19:43,860
Chat, please.

5073
04:19:43,860 --> 04:19:44,860
Big brother.

5074
04:19:44,860 --> 04:19:45,860
Only chat.

5075
04:19:45,860 --> 04:19:47,860
Whatever you want me to call you.

5076
04:19:47,860 --> 04:19:48,860
I don't care.

5077
04:19:48,860 --> 04:19:49,860
Please.

5078
04:19:50,860 --> 04:19:53,860
I'll fucking call you OG-san if you want.

5079
04:19:53,860 --> 04:19:55,860
I'll do anything, please.

5080
04:19:55,860 --> 04:19:57,860
I'll do anything, please, please, please.

5081
04:19:57,860 --> 04:19:59,860
Please.

5082
04:20:02,860 --> 04:20:03,860
Are you gay?

5083
04:20:03,860 --> 04:20:05,860
Why are you acting so gay?

5084
04:20:05,860 --> 04:20:06,860
Do.

5085
04:20:06,860 --> 04:20:07,860
Not.

5086
04:20:07,860 --> 04:20:08,860
Give.

5087
04:20:08,860 --> 04:20:09,860
In.

5088
04:20:09,860 --> 04:20:11,860
Well, it's not 51%.

5089
04:20:11,860 --> 04:20:12,860
That's basically it.

5090
04:20:12,860 --> 04:20:13,860
Come on, it's not 51.

5091
04:20:13,860 --> 04:20:14,860
That's 150.

5092
04:20:14,860 --> 04:20:16,860
Please, that's literally more than 50.

5093
04:20:16,860 --> 04:20:17,860
It's not 52 now.

5094
04:20:17,860 --> 04:20:19,860
It's the only way to end.

5095
04:20:19,860 --> 04:20:20,860
Huh?

5096
04:20:20,860 --> 04:20:21,860
No.

5097
04:20:22,860 --> 04:20:23,860
Are you gay?

5098
04:20:23,860 --> 04:20:24,860
It's not 52.

5099
04:20:24,860 --> 04:20:26,860
I can go, I can go, I can go, I can go.

5100
04:20:26,860 --> 04:20:28,860
Sweetie, be a good girl and do it.

5101
04:20:28,860 --> 04:20:30,860
You know we both want it.

5102
04:20:33,860 --> 04:20:34,860
Fuck.

5103
04:20:34,860 --> 04:20:35,860
Okay.

5104
04:20:35,860 --> 04:20:37,860
I'm taking the iPhone because...

5105
04:20:37,860 --> 04:20:38,860
Wait.

5106
04:20:38,860 --> 04:20:39,860
Maybe I can get another phone.

5107
04:20:39,860 --> 04:20:40,860
Hold on.

5108
04:20:40,860 --> 04:20:42,860
I have an old phone somewhere.

5109
04:20:42,860 --> 04:20:43,860
My phone died.

5110
04:20:43,860 --> 04:20:44,860
What do I do?

5111
04:20:44,860 --> 04:20:45,860
What do I do?

5112
04:20:45,860 --> 04:20:47,860
Don't be a bad girl.

5113
04:20:47,860 --> 04:20:48,860
Oh my god.

5114
04:20:51,860 --> 04:20:52,860
What do I do?

5115
04:20:52,860 --> 04:20:53,860
Should I just take the iPhone?

5116
04:20:53,860 --> 04:20:55,860
Why are you acting so gay?

5117
04:20:55,860 --> 04:20:57,860
Try pressing on your stomach a little.

5118
04:20:57,860 --> 04:20:58,860
Shut up.

5119
04:20:58,860 --> 04:20:59,860
Okay, I'm taking the iPhone.

5120
04:20:59,860 --> 04:21:00,860
You're going to lose tracking.

5121
04:21:00,860 --> 04:21:02,860
My other phone died.

5122
04:21:04,860 --> 04:21:05,860
Are you gay?

5123
04:21:05,860 --> 04:21:07,860
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

5124
04:21:07,860 --> 04:21:08,860
Bye, bye, bye.

5125
04:21:08,860 --> 04:21:09,860
It's 52 now.

5126
04:21:13,860 --> 04:21:14,860
Wait, why does it say no?

5127
04:21:14,860 --> 04:21:15,860
Are you gay?

5128
04:21:15,860 --> 04:21:17,860
Wait, why does it say that no one?

5129
04:21:17,860 --> 04:21:18,860
Wait, I was literally about to go.

5130
04:21:18,860 --> 04:21:20,860
It's at 52 for no breath.

5131
04:21:20,860 --> 04:21:21,860
Wait, I was literally about to go.

5132
04:21:21,860 --> 04:21:22,860
What do you mean?

5133
04:21:22,860 --> 04:21:23,860
What do you mean?

5134
04:21:23,860 --> 04:21:24,860
What do you mean?

5135
04:21:24,860 --> 04:21:25,860
What do I do?

5136
04:21:25,860 --> 04:21:26,860
Are you gay?

5137
04:21:26,860 --> 04:21:27,860
Why are you acting so gay?

5138
04:21:27,860 --> 04:21:29,860
I was literally just about to go.

5139
04:21:29,860 --> 04:21:30,860
Here.

5140
04:21:30,860 --> 04:21:31,860
Right.

5141
04:21:31,860 --> 04:21:32,860
Now.

5142
04:21:32,860 --> 04:21:35,860
No, no, no, no, no, no.

5143
04:21:35,860 --> 04:21:36,860
Please.

5144
04:21:36,860 --> 04:21:37,860
Please.

5145
04:21:38,860 --> 04:21:39,860
What do you want?

5146
04:21:42,860 --> 04:21:43,860
What do you want?

5147
04:21:47,860 --> 04:21:48,860
I don't even...

5148
04:21:49,860 --> 04:21:50,860
What do I do?

5149
04:21:50,860 --> 04:21:51,860
What do you want me to do?

5150
04:21:52,860 --> 04:21:53,860
Gay?

5151
04:21:53,860 --> 04:21:55,860
Why are you acting so gay?

5152
04:21:55,860 --> 04:21:57,860
Looks like someone can't see straight.

5153
04:21:58,860 --> 04:21:59,860
What?

5154
04:22:01,860 --> 04:22:02,860
I can't.

5155
04:22:02,860 --> 04:22:03,860
I can't.

5156
04:22:03,860 --> 04:22:04,860
I can't go.

5157
04:22:04,860 --> 04:22:05,860
I'm not going here.

5158
04:22:07,860 --> 04:22:09,860
Please ask nicely again.

5159
04:22:11,860 --> 04:22:16,860
I literally got my phone ready for it and everything.

5160
04:22:18,860 --> 04:22:19,860
Shit.

5161
04:22:21,860 --> 04:22:23,860
Fuck a prison lock button.

5162
04:22:23,860 --> 04:22:25,860
Why are you acting so gay?

5163
04:22:25,860 --> 04:22:26,860
You know what it is, Emmy.

5164
04:22:26,860 --> 04:22:28,860
IDD feels so good.

5165
04:22:29,860 --> 04:22:30,860
No.

5166
04:22:33,860 --> 04:22:34,860
Please.

5167
04:22:34,860 --> 04:22:36,860
I'm asking nicely.

5168
04:22:36,860 --> 04:22:37,860
I'm sorry.

5169
04:22:37,860 --> 04:22:39,860
The tracking is gone.

5170
04:22:39,860 --> 04:22:40,860
I'm ready.

5171
04:22:40,860 --> 04:22:42,860
I'm ready to do what you want.

5172
04:22:42,860 --> 04:22:43,860
Please.

5173
04:22:43,860 --> 04:22:44,860
Just let me call.

5174
04:22:45,860 --> 04:22:47,860
Please let me call.

5175
04:22:47,860 --> 04:22:48,860
Are you gay?

5176
04:22:48,860 --> 04:22:50,860
Why are you acting so gay?

5177
04:22:50,860 --> 04:22:53,860
I still feel like you can hurt a bit longer.

5178
04:22:53,860 --> 04:22:55,860
No, I can't.

5179
04:22:55,860 --> 04:22:56,860
I can't.

5180
04:22:56,860 --> 04:22:57,860
I seriously can't.

5181
04:22:57,860 --> 04:22:58,860
Gay?

5182
04:22:58,860 --> 04:23:00,860
Why are you acting so gay?

5183
04:23:00,860 --> 04:23:01,860
I'm literally done.

5184
04:23:01,860 --> 04:23:03,860
Remind me what the safe word was again.

5185
04:23:08,860 --> 04:23:09,860
I don't want to say it.

5186
04:23:11,860 --> 04:23:15,860
The safe word was rats.

5187
04:23:15,860 --> 04:23:16,860
Rats.

5188
04:23:16,860 --> 04:23:17,860
There.

5189
04:23:17,860 --> 04:23:18,860
Are you gay?

5190
04:23:18,860 --> 04:23:19,860
You said it.

5191
04:23:19,860 --> 04:23:20,860
Why are you acting so gay?

5192
04:23:20,860 --> 04:23:21,860
Can I please call now?

5193
04:23:21,860 --> 04:23:23,860
Remember when she talked smack chat?

5194
04:23:24,860 --> 04:23:25,860
No.

5195
04:23:25,860 --> 04:23:26,860
I promise.

5196
04:23:26,860 --> 04:23:27,860
That's not the case anymore.

5197
04:23:27,860 --> 04:23:28,860
That's not the case anymore.

5198
04:23:28,860 --> 04:23:30,860
That's not the case anymore.

5199
04:23:31,860 --> 04:23:32,860
Go.

04:26:33,200 --> 04:26:37,200
What do I do?

5225
04:26:37,200 --> 04:26:41,200
Can I save it as a draft?

5226
04:26:41,200 --> 04:26:45,200
Oh my god, what do I do?

5227
04:26:45,200 --> 04:26:49,200
But it's not on- I can't post this on main.

5228
04:26:49,200 --> 04:26:53,200
I can't post this on main.

5229
04:26:53,200 --> 04:26:57,200
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

5230
04:26:57,200 --> 04:27:01,200
Sorry for torturing you but you say please in such a cute way.

5231
04:27:02,200 --> 04:27:05,200
How do you believe it is fried chicken?

5232
04:27:05,200 --> 04:27:09,200
Post it, download it, then delete it?

5233
04:27:12,200 --> 04:27:17,200
Can I trust you to download this as soon as possible?

5234
04:27:17,200 --> 04:27:19,200
So I can delete it?

5235
04:27:19,200 --> 04:27:21,200
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

5236
04:27:21,200 --> 04:27:23,200
Because I posted this on main.

5237
04:27:23,200 --> 04:27:27,200
I'm so proud of you. I love you so much. You're my good girl.

5238
04:27:27,200 --> 04:27:30,200
You held out for so long.

5239
04:27:30,200 --> 04:27:32,200
I love you too.

5240
04:27:32,200 --> 04:27:34,200
Damn it to the sky?

5241
04:27:34,200 --> 04:27:37,200
I don't know what that means.

5242
04:27:37,200 --> 04:27:41,200
Private main for 5 minutes then download it first.

5243
04:27:45,200 --> 04:27:47,200
We will have in like 10 seconds.

5244
04:27:47,200 --> 04:27:48,200
Are you ready to download it?

5245
04:27:48,200 --> 04:27:50,200
Don't post it, re-upload it to alt.

5246
04:27:50,200 --> 04:27:53,200
Like I can't re-upload it because it's in-

5247
04:27:53,200 --> 04:27:55,200
I recorded it with the in-app twitter thing.

5248
04:27:55,200 --> 04:27:57,200
Here, let me listen to it actually.

5249
04:27:57,200 --> 04:27:59,200
Hold on, I'm muting it so you can't hear it.

5250
04:27:59,200 --> 04:28:01,200
You can't DM it to yourself? No.

5251
04:28:01,200 --> 04:28:05,200
It's like ready to post but it's on my main account.

5252
04:28:05,200 --> 04:28:07,200
Okay, let me listen to it.

5253
04:28:24,200 --> 04:28:28,200
Oh my god, it was all for nothing.

5254
04:28:28,200 --> 04:28:30,200
The audio got fried.

5255
04:28:30,200 --> 04:28:32,200
I don't know what happened.

5256
04:28:32,200 --> 04:28:34,200
It's so fried.

5257
04:28:34,200 --> 04:28:36,200
I promise I'm not joking too.

5258
04:28:38,200 --> 04:28:40,200
It's so...

5259
04:28:40,200 --> 04:28:42,200
Like it sounds deep fried.

5260
04:28:42,200 --> 04:28:44,200
Oh, it's over.

5261
04:28:44,200 --> 04:28:46,200
I promise you I'm not joking.

5262
04:28:46,200 --> 04:28:47,200
I'm sorry.

5263
04:28:47,200 --> 04:28:49,200
I will literally let you listen to it.

5264
04:28:49,200 --> 04:28:50,200
That's how fried it is.

5265
04:28:50,200 --> 04:28:52,200
Like it's so...

5266
04:28:52,200 --> 04:28:54,200
Post it for proof.

5267
04:28:54,200 --> 04:28:56,200
It's deep fried.

5268
04:28:56,200 --> 04:28:58,200
I think it's really really badly.

5269
04:28:58,200 --> 04:29:00,200
Oh, I'm so sorry.

5270
04:29:00,200 --> 04:29:02,200
Oh...

5271
04:29:02,200 --> 04:29:04,200
Let us listen.

5272
04:29:04,200 --> 04:29:06,200
Okay, hold on, let me continue listening.

5273
04:29:12,200 --> 04:29:14,200
Like it literally sounds like...

5274
04:29:14,200 --> 04:29:16,200
Okay, can we hear it?

5275
04:29:16,200 --> 04:29:18,200
No, it's like really...

5276
04:29:18,200 --> 04:29:20,200
I'll post it for like 5 seconds.

5277
04:29:22,200 --> 04:29:24,200
And then let you download it.

5278
04:29:24,200 --> 04:29:26,200
But it's do another recording later.

5279
04:29:26,200 --> 04:29:30,200
The universe didn't want me to do this.

5280
04:29:32,200 --> 04:29:34,200
Okay, let me listen to the full thing.

5281
04:29:34,200 --> 04:29:36,200
It's like about a minute long.

5282
04:29:55,200 --> 04:29:58,200
It sounds like a robot pissing.

5283
04:30:00,200 --> 04:30:02,200
Oh, it sounds like a robot.

5284
04:30:02,200 --> 04:30:04,200
Oh man, I'm so sorry.

5285
04:30:04,200 --> 04:30:06,200
I don't know what happened.

5286
04:30:06,200 --> 04:30:08,200
I am using a refurbished iPhone.

5287
04:30:08,200 --> 04:30:10,200
So it's possible it's kind of broken still.

5288
04:30:14,200 --> 04:30:16,200
I'm in debt to you.

5289
04:30:16,200 --> 04:30:18,200
Are you acting so gay?

5290
04:30:18,200 --> 04:30:20,200
iPhone mic claims another victim.

5291
04:30:20,200 --> 04:30:22,200
It's the thought that counts at least.

5292
04:30:22,200 --> 04:30:24,200
Okay, I'm gonna post it for like...

5293
04:30:24,200 --> 04:30:26,200
Not even 5 minutes.

5294
04:30:28,200 --> 04:30:30,200
Here's your robot pissing.

5295
04:30:30,200 --> 04:30:32,200
There.

5296
04:30:34,200 --> 04:30:36,200
I'm so sorry.

5297
04:30:38,200 --> 04:30:42,200
The first audio recording I did on this phone was fine too.

5298
04:30:42,200 --> 04:30:44,200
Okay, well...

5299
04:30:46,200 --> 04:30:48,200
Please get ready to download it, okay?

5300
04:30:48,200 --> 04:30:50,200
Post.

5301
04:30:52,200 --> 04:30:54,200
I truly don't know what happened.

5302
04:31:00,200 --> 04:31:02,200
Maybe it won't be deep fried once I post it.

5303
04:31:08,200 --> 04:31:10,200
I'm nookin' this vlog.

5304
04:31:10,200 --> 04:31:12,200
Absolutely not.

5305
04:31:16,200 --> 04:31:18,200
I guess it was just my phone that deep fried it.

5306
04:31:24,200 --> 04:31:26,200
No, that was an accident.

5307
04:31:26,200 --> 04:31:28,200
That was an accident.

5308
04:31:28,200 --> 04:31:30,200
I didn't know who would play.

5309
04:31:30,200 --> 04:31:34,200
I didn't know who would play in the desktop audio.

5310
04:31:36,200 --> 04:31:38,200
Okay.

5311
04:31:40,200 --> 04:31:42,200
I can't believe I uploaded that on main.

5312
04:31:46,200 --> 04:31:48,200
Okay, it's gone now though, right?

5313
04:31:56,200 --> 04:31:58,200
Oh my god, okay.

5314
04:32:00,200 --> 04:32:02,200
I'm trying to find vtube studio. Hold on.

5315
04:32:04,200 --> 04:32:06,200
I hate myself. I'm so fucking stupid.

5316
04:32:06,200 --> 04:32:08,200
I can't believe I fucking did that. What's wrong with me?

5317
04:32:10,200 --> 04:32:12,200
What's wrong with me?

5318
04:32:12,200 --> 04:32:14,200
What's wrong with me?

5319
04:32:16,200 --> 04:32:18,200
Okay, there's your tracking.

5320
04:32:20,200 --> 04:32:24,200
I fucking play that on stream like a dumb bitch.

5321
04:32:34,200 --> 04:32:36,200
Good job, big bro is proud of you.

5322
04:32:36,200 --> 04:32:40,200
You can give yourself a pat on the back for doing so well.

5323
04:32:40,200 --> 04:32:42,200
Good girl, I'm proud of you.

5324
04:32:42,200 --> 04:32:44,200
Pampering isn't bound.

5325
04:32:46,200 --> 04:32:48,200
Thank you.

5326
04:32:50,200 --> 04:32:54,200
I was so scared that it got deep fried because it was deep fried on my phone.

5327
04:32:56,200 --> 04:32:58,200
Alright, good thing it's not.

5328
04:33:00,200 --> 04:33:02,200
Feel free to save that.

5329
04:33:02,200 --> 04:33:06,200
I'm not reposting it to my NSFW today.

5330
04:33:06,200 --> 04:33:08,200
If you saved it, you saved it.

5331
04:33:08,200 --> 04:33:10,200
It's tough luck.

5332
04:33:14,200 --> 04:33:16,200
Right.

5333
04:33:18,200 --> 04:33:20,200
What do I do now?

5334
04:33:26,200 --> 04:33:32,200
I don't think I'll make it to another P.

5335
04:33:32,200 --> 04:33:36,200
I would like to finish the game.

5336
04:33:36,200 --> 04:33:38,200
Yes, please help me finish the game.

5337
04:33:44,200 --> 04:33:48,200
Let me know when you've gotten the teeth and bones and rocks sorted out.

5338
04:33:48,200 --> 04:33:52,200
It's already posted like seven times.

5339
04:33:52,200 --> 04:33:54,200
Okay.

5340
04:33:54,200 --> 04:33:56,200
Pam.

5341
04:34:00,200 --> 04:34:02,200
What do I do?

5342
04:34:06,200 --> 04:34:08,200
I don't have to hold it anymore.

5343
04:34:08,200 --> 04:34:10,200
Should we just finish the stream normally?

5344
04:34:14,200 --> 04:34:16,200
Rocks in the garden.

5345
04:34:16,200 --> 04:34:18,200
Okay.

5346
04:34:20,200 --> 04:34:22,200
Right here.

5347
04:34:24,200 --> 04:34:26,200
And then what?

5348
04:34:34,200 --> 04:34:36,200
Yeah, we might as well finish.

5349
04:34:36,200 --> 04:34:38,200
I want to finish it.

5350
04:34:38,200 --> 04:34:40,200
What do I do with rocks?

5351
04:34:44,200 --> 04:34:46,200
Are you gay?

5352
04:34:46,200 --> 04:34:48,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5353
04:34:48,200 --> 04:34:50,200
You did great, Emmy.

5354
04:34:50,200 --> 04:34:52,200
I look forward to next time we can bully and spoil you.

5355
04:34:52,200 --> 04:34:54,200
Love you so much.

5356
04:34:54,200 --> 04:34:56,200
My cutest little sister.

5357
04:34:56,200 --> 04:34:58,200
Are you gay?

5358
04:34:58,200 --> 04:35:00,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5359
04:35:00,200 --> 04:35:02,200
Thanks for being the best sister ever.

5360
04:35:04,200 --> 04:35:06,200
Thank you.

5361
04:35:06,200 --> 04:35:08,200
Sorry, I should probably mute the alert sound.

5362
04:35:08,200 --> 04:35:10,200
It's probably annoying.

5363
04:35:14,200 --> 04:35:16,200
Do we have enough time to get another low energy?

5364
04:35:16,200 --> 04:35:18,200
No, we don't.

5365
04:35:18,200 --> 04:35:20,200
No, we don't.

5366
04:35:20,200 --> 04:35:22,200
I'm literally so...

5367
04:35:24,200 --> 04:35:26,200
All that remains now is cleaning up the basement.

5368
04:35:26,200 --> 04:35:28,200
Do we have to?

5369
04:35:28,200 --> 04:35:30,200
Obviously.

5370
04:35:30,200 --> 04:35:32,200
Why?

5371
04:35:32,200 --> 04:35:34,200
Oh, I can finish my sausage now.

5372
04:35:40,200 --> 04:35:42,200
Okay.

5373
04:35:46,200 --> 04:35:48,200
We're going to live here, right?

5374
04:35:50,200 --> 04:35:52,200
Are you gay?

5375
04:35:52,200 --> 04:35:54,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5376
04:35:54,200 --> 04:35:56,200
Such a good girl, Emmy.

5377
04:35:56,200 --> 04:35:58,200
So is there a round 3?

5378
04:35:58,200 --> 04:36:00,200
No.

5379
04:36:04,200 --> 04:36:06,200
Thank you for calling me a good girl, though.

5380
04:36:12,200 --> 04:36:14,200
Are you gay?

5381
04:36:14,200 --> 04:36:16,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5382
04:36:16,200 --> 04:36:18,200
Are you good?

5383
04:36:18,200 --> 04:36:20,200
Did we go too hard on you?

5384
04:36:22,200 --> 04:36:24,200
I'm okay.

5385
04:36:26,200 --> 04:36:28,200
I'm okay.

5386
04:36:36,200 --> 04:36:38,200
Okay, I finished my sausage.

5387
04:36:48,200 --> 04:36:50,200
Thank you for all the praises.

5388
04:37:04,200 --> 04:37:06,200
They have coworkers, friends, other family beside us.

5389
04:37:06,200 --> 04:37:08,200
What a bunch of whores.

5390
04:37:08,200 --> 04:37:10,200
Why weren't they happy with just each other?

5391
04:37:10,200 --> 04:37:12,200
I didn't imply they fucked any of them.

5392
04:37:12,200 --> 04:37:14,200
Irrelevant.

5393
04:37:14,200 --> 04:37:16,200
It's all the same.

5394
04:37:16,200 --> 04:37:18,200
Anyway, they can't go all up.

5395
04:37:18,200 --> 04:37:20,200
They can't all go haven't heard from those two in a while.

5396
04:37:20,200 --> 04:37:22,200
Oh well.

5397
04:37:22,200 --> 04:37:24,200
Someone's going to come looking with the authorities.

5398
04:37:24,200 --> 04:37:26,200
And who will they find here?

5399
04:37:26,200 --> 04:37:28,200
Their children who didn't report their parents missing?

5400
04:37:28,200 --> 04:37:30,200
One whole minute.

5401
04:37:30,200 --> 04:37:32,200
One whole minute.

5402
04:37:32,200 --> 04:37:34,200
One whole minute.

5403
04:37:34,200 --> 04:37:36,200
One whole minute.

5404
04:37:36,200 --> 04:37:38,200
One whole minute.

5405
04:37:38,200 --> 04:37:40,200
One whole minute.

5406
04:37:42,200 --> 04:37:44,200
I am such a good girl.

5407
04:37:54,200 --> 04:37:56,200
And who will they find here?

5408
04:37:56,200 --> 04:37:58,200
Their children who didn't report their parents missing?

5409
04:37:58,200 --> 04:38:00,200
Officer gay?

5410
04:38:00,200 --> 04:38:02,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5411
04:38:02,200 --> 04:38:04,200
Good job, Amy.

5412
04:38:04,200 --> 04:38:06,200
You're the best little sister a brother could have.

5413
04:38:06,200 --> 04:38:08,200
Thank you.

5414
04:38:08,200 --> 04:38:10,200
You're the best brother a sister could have.

5415
04:38:10,200 --> 04:38:12,200
How the fuck aren't you dead anyways?

5416
04:38:12,200 --> 04:38:14,200
Are you gay?

5417
04:38:14,200 --> 04:38:16,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5418
04:38:16,200 --> 04:38:18,200
You did so well.

5419
04:38:18,200 --> 04:38:20,200
Our beloved little sister.

5420
04:38:20,200 --> 04:38:22,200
Good girl, Amy.

5421
04:38:22,200 --> 04:38:24,200
Aww, thank you.

5422
04:38:24,200 --> 04:38:26,200
I didn't expect so much praise after that.

5423
04:38:26,200 --> 04:38:28,200
Aww, thank you.

5424
04:38:28,200 --> 04:38:30,200
I didn't expect so much praise after that.

5425
04:38:30,200 --> 04:38:32,200
I didn't expect so much praise after that.

5426
04:38:32,200 --> 04:38:34,200
I didn't expect so much praise after that.

5427
04:38:34,200 --> 04:38:36,200
If you don't want to stay here, just say so.

5428
04:38:36,200 --> 04:38:38,200
If you don't want to stay here, just say so.

5429
04:38:38,200 --> 04:38:40,200
It's not that I don't want to.

5430
04:38:40,200 --> 04:38:42,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5431
04:38:42,200 --> 04:38:44,200
A very good girl and so well trained.

5432
04:38:44,200 --> 04:38:46,200
I love you.

5433
04:38:46,200 --> 04:38:48,200
Well trained?

5434
04:38:48,200 --> 04:38:50,200
I was the one that's supposed to train you.

5435
04:38:50,200 --> 04:38:52,200
I love you too though.

5436
04:38:54,200 --> 04:38:56,200
Okay.

5437
04:38:56,200 --> 04:38:58,200
It's not that I don't want to.

5438
04:38:58,200 --> 04:39:00,200
It's just that I don't think we can.

5439
04:39:00,200 --> 04:39:02,200
It's just that I don't think we can.

5440
04:39:02,200 --> 04:39:04,200
Well, can we at least use their IDs?

5441
04:39:04,200 --> 04:39:06,200
We can be the new Mr.

5442
04:39:06,200 --> 04:39:08,200
We can be the new and improved Mr. and Mrs. Graves.

5443
04:39:10,200 --> 04:39:12,200
Proud of you.

5444
04:39:12,200 --> 04:39:14,200
You did such a good job.

5445
04:39:14,200 --> 04:39:16,200
Thank you.

5446
04:39:16,200 --> 04:39:18,200
It's so nice to get praise like this.

5447
04:39:18,200 --> 04:39:20,200
Oh my god.

5448
04:39:20,200 --> 04:39:22,200
I love aftercare.

5449
04:39:22,200 --> 04:39:24,200
What the fuck?

5450
04:39:24,200 --> 04:39:26,200
Are you gay?

5451
04:39:26,200 --> 04:39:28,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5452
04:39:28,200 --> 04:39:30,200
You deserve the praise.

5453
04:39:30,200 --> 04:39:32,200
You are the best.

5454
04:39:32,200 --> 04:39:34,200
Love you and me.

5455
04:39:34,200 --> 04:39:36,200
I love you too.

5456
04:39:36,200 --> 04:39:38,200
Thank you.

5457
04:39:38,200 --> 04:39:40,200
All right.

5458
04:39:40,200 --> 04:39:42,200
Once the authorities start looking for them,

5459
04:39:42,200 --> 04:39:44,200
I'll see what we've been up to with theirs.

5460
04:39:44,200 --> 04:39:46,200
Sorry, Ashley.

5461
04:39:46,200 --> 04:39:48,200
I wish it was that easy.

5462
04:39:48,200 --> 04:39:50,200
Are you gay?

5463
04:39:50,200 --> 04:39:52,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5464
04:39:52,200 --> 04:39:54,200
You deserve the praise.

5465
04:39:54,200 --> 04:39:56,200
You are the best.

5466
04:39:56,200 --> 04:39:58,200
Are you gay?

5467
04:39:58,200 --> 04:40:00,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5468
04:40:00,200 --> 04:40:02,200
I can't believe Maye Moto

5469
04:40:02,200 --> 04:40:04,200
is so good at grooming her own e-i-chan.

5470
04:40:06,200 --> 04:40:08,200
Own e-i-chan?

5471
04:40:14,200 --> 04:40:16,200
Did she say she'll clean the basement?

5472
04:40:16,200 --> 04:40:18,200
Are you gay?

5473
04:40:18,200 --> 04:40:20,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5474
04:40:20,200 --> 04:40:22,200
This dream was amazing.

5475
04:40:22,200 --> 04:40:24,200
You're the best of me.

5476
04:40:24,200 --> 04:40:26,200
I'm glad you liked it.

5477
04:40:30,200 --> 04:40:32,200
I need a mop.

5478
04:40:32,200 --> 04:40:34,200
I'll finally this fucking mop.

5479
04:40:38,200 --> 04:40:40,200
After staring at the mop this whole game.

5480
04:40:44,200 --> 04:40:46,200
I'm kind of disappointed that there's not more to the game.

5481
04:40:50,200 --> 04:40:52,200
Am I done?

5482
04:40:54,200 --> 04:40:56,200
Are you gay?

5483
04:40:56,200 --> 04:40:58,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5484
04:40:58,200 --> 04:41:00,200
Pat pat pat pat.

5485
04:41:00,200 --> 04:41:02,200
Get praise.

5486
04:41:02,200 --> 04:41:04,200
Get praise.

5487
04:41:04,200 --> 04:41:06,200
Get praise.

5488
04:41:06,200 --> 04:41:08,200
Get praise.

5489
04:41:08,200 --> 04:41:10,200
Get praise.

5490
04:41:10,200 --> 04:41:12,200
Get praise.

5491
04:41:12,200 --> 04:41:14,200
Get praise.

5492
04:41:14,200 --> 04:41:16,200
This one?

5493
04:41:16,200 --> 04:41:18,200
No blind.

5494
04:41:18,200 --> 04:41:20,200
Okay.

5495
04:41:20,200 --> 04:41:22,200
Take it.

5496
04:41:30,200 --> 04:41:32,200
So gay?

5497
04:41:32,200 --> 04:41:34,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5498
04:41:34,200 --> 04:41:36,200
After the stream is done.

5499
04:41:36,200 --> 04:41:38,200
I'm going to have my own accident.

5500
04:41:38,200 --> 04:41:42,200
Have you been holding it in too or something?

5501
04:41:44,200 --> 04:41:48,200
More content is a bit delayed to her estimate from what I've heard.

5502
04:41:48,200 --> 04:41:50,200
Really? That's a shame.

5503
04:41:50,200 --> 04:41:52,200
It's a good game.

5504
04:41:52,200 --> 04:41:54,200
Are you gay?

5505
04:41:54,200 --> 04:41:56,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5506
04:41:56,200 --> 04:42:00,200
After all that torturing you deserve all the praising and love of me.

5507
04:42:00,200 --> 04:42:02,200
I do.

5508
04:42:02,200 --> 04:42:04,200
Are you gay?

5509
04:42:04,200 --> 04:42:06,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5510
04:42:06,200 --> 04:42:08,200
Give me your shrimp play the best ever.

5511
04:42:08,200 --> 04:42:10,200
Can't help but love of me.

5512
04:42:10,200 --> 04:42:12,200
I am the best.

5513
04:42:14,200 --> 04:42:16,200
The creator got doxed.

5514
04:42:16,200 --> 04:42:18,200
The creator got doxed.

5515
04:42:18,200 --> 04:42:20,200
That sucks.

5516
04:42:22,200 --> 04:42:24,200
Oh man.

5517
04:42:24,200 --> 04:42:26,200
Bruh.

5518
04:42:26,200 --> 04:42:28,200
That sucks so much.

5519
04:42:28,200 --> 04:42:30,200
I hope that they can make more.

5520
04:42:30,200 --> 04:42:32,200
I will personally pay for more of the game.

5521
04:42:32,200 --> 04:42:34,200
I will fund it myself if I have to.

5522
04:42:36,200 --> 04:42:40,200
Though there's no way to tell if we missed something still.

5523
04:42:40,200 --> 04:42:42,200
Other than maybe see if you have a dream.

5524
04:42:42,200 --> 04:42:44,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5525
04:42:44,200 --> 04:42:46,200
You made so much lemonade today.

5526
04:42:46,200 --> 04:42:48,200
Party face.

5527
04:42:48,200 --> 04:42:50,200
Birthday cake.

5528
04:42:50,200 --> 04:42:52,200
I did.

5529
04:42:54,200 --> 04:42:58,200
I offer two souls so it stands to reason I have at least two visions to come.

5530
04:42:58,200 --> 04:43:02,200
How about I take a nap and see if a disaster awaits?

5531
04:43:02,200 --> 04:43:04,200
Please do.

5532
04:43:04,200 --> 04:43:06,200
Are we sleeping on the couch together?

5533
04:43:06,200 --> 04:43:10,200
The game is still getting developed. The creator is just hiding offline now.

5534
04:43:10,200 --> 04:43:12,200
Okay.

5535
04:43:12,200 --> 04:43:14,200
Just get the creator to do a stream like this.

5536
04:43:14,200 --> 04:43:16,200
Clearly it works for funding.

5537
04:43:16,200 --> 04:43:18,200
I was surprised.

5538
04:43:20,200 --> 04:43:22,200
Now that your mother said there's no need to sleep down here.

5539
04:43:22,200 --> 04:43:24,200
Oh we're sleeping in parents' room.

5540
04:43:24,200 --> 04:43:26,200
So if the game's not done, why are there endings?

5541
04:43:30,200 --> 04:43:32,200
Are you gay?

5542
04:43:32,200 --> 04:43:34,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5543
04:43:34,200 --> 04:43:36,200
I know I'm going to have an accident to that audio.

5544
04:43:38,200 --> 04:43:40,200
What?

5545
04:43:40,200 --> 04:43:42,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

5546
04:43:44,200 --> 04:43:46,200
The guest of the game is in production.

5547
04:43:46,200 --> 04:43:48,200
They're basically doing it offline.

5548
04:43:56,200 --> 04:44:00,200
I just want to make sure that I didn't get banked for posting that on main.

5549
04:44:00,200 --> 04:44:02,200
Fuck.

5550
04:44:08,200 --> 04:44:10,200
Hold on.

5551
04:44:10,200 --> 04:44:16,200
I mean it's okay. I'm not logged into Discord so I can't see if that was a bad idea.

5552
04:44:16,200 --> 04:44:18,200
It's okay I deleted it.

5553
04:44:24,200 --> 04:44:26,200
Yeah I didn't post anything.

5554
04:44:26,200 --> 04:44:28,200
I didn't post anything.

5555
04:44:28,200 --> 04:44:32,200
You don't uh could you possibly give any less of a fuck that'd be great?

5556
04:44:32,200 --> 04:44:36,200
Oh do forgive me your highness it's been a week or two.

5557
04:44:36,200 --> 04:44:38,200
Yeah it was an accident sorry.

5558
04:44:38,200 --> 04:44:42,200
And and run out of yours you didn't even remember our parents address.

5559
04:44:42,200 --> 04:44:46,200
Which is of course just as important as this.

5560
04:44:46,200 --> 04:44:50,200
Look it just said that I need to do the...

5561
04:44:50,200 --> 04:44:52,200
I need to hold on to it to have a clear point dream that's it.

5562
04:44:52,200 --> 04:44:56,200
It was in my pockets last time when it happened.

5563
04:44:56,200 --> 04:44:58,200
Then I could hold it this time.

5564
04:45:00,200 --> 04:45:04,200
It gave it to me so maybe it wouldn't work with you.

5565
04:45:04,200 --> 04:45:06,200
What's it hurt to try?

5566
04:45:06,200 --> 04:45:08,200
Are you gay?

5567
04:45:08,200 --> 04:45:10,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5568
04:45:10,200 --> 04:45:14,200
Gimme I am proud of you more so than I've ever been proud of anyone or anything before.

5569
04:45:14,200 --> 04:45:16,200
And that pride is constant.

5570
04:45:16,200 --> 04:45:20,200
Keep up all the good work and know that we all love you.

5571
04:45:20,200 --> 04:45:24,200
Aww I love you too.

5572
04:45:24,200 --> 04:45:26,200
Thank you.

5573
04:45:26,200 --> 04:45:28,200
Okay.

5574
04:45:32,200 --> 04:45:34,200
I did get it I just don't care.

5575
04:45:34,200 --> 04:45:36,200
Stop being so selfish all the time let me try.

5576
04:45:36,200 --> 04:45:38,200
It's my trinket.

5577
04:45:38,200 --> 04:45:40,200
Ever heard of sharing?

5578
04:45:40,200 --> 04:45:42,200
How am I supposed to share this?

5579
04:45:42,200 --> 04:45:44,200
Do you want to cut the trinket in half?

5580
04:45:44,200 --> 04:45:46,200
I'm sure that's a great idea.

5581
04:45:46,200 --> 04:45:48,200
No just we're not cutting it.

5582
04:45:48,200 --> 04:45:50,200
That's not it but I'm sure we can both hold it at the same time.

5583
04:45:50,200 --> 04:45:52,200
Let me hold it.

5584
04:45:54,200 --> 04:45:56,200
How are you feeling?

5585
04:45:56,200 --> 04:45:58,200
Relieved.

5586
04:45:58,200 --> 04:46:00,200
See if either of us gets a vision.

5587
04:46:00,200 --> 04:46:02,200
How it's a bit small.

5588
04:46:02,200 --> 04:46:04,200
Between our hands right?

5589
04:46:04,200 --> 04:46:06,200
Oh my how romantic.

5590
04:46:06,200 --> 04:46:08,200
Come again.

5591
04:46:08,200 --> 04:46:10,200
Holding hands when we sleep together.

5592
04:46:10,200 --> 04:46:12,200
Man fuck off.

5593
04:46:12,200 --> 04:46:14,200
Alright forget this goodnight.

5594
04:46:14,200 --> 04:46:16,200
I'm kidding I'm kidding it's fine.

5595
04:46:16,200 --> 04:46:18,200
Though I still think I'm gonna be the only one who has a vision.

5596
04:46:18,200 --> 04:46:20,200
We'll see.

5597
04:46:20,200 --> 04:46:22,200
Good night.

5598
04:46:22,200 --> 04:46:24,200
Good night.

5599
04:46:28,200 --> 04:46:30,200
Fuck this.

5600
04:46:30,200 --> 04:46:32,200
How am I supposed to sleep after you went and said something so off color?

5601
04:46:32,200 --> 04:46:34,200
To us.

5602
04:46:34,200 --> 04:46:36,200
I'll take it.

5603
04:46:36,200 --> 04:46:38,200
If for once she regretted the both of us then I'm happy.

5604
04:46:42,200 --> 04:46:44,200
What?

5605
04:46:44,200 --> 04:46:46,200
Aw nothing goodnight.

5606
04:46:46,200 --> 04:46:48,200
It isn't long until sleep takes you over.

5607
04:46:52,200 --> 04:46:54,200
Get ready get down bad.

5608
04:46:56,200 --> 04:46:58,200
What's about to happen?

5609
04:46:58,200 --> 04:47:00,200
Sucky drawing.

5610
04:47:00,200 --> 04:47:02,200
Oh that's how we get to the place.

5611
04:47:06,200 --> 04:47:08,200
Over here.

5612
04:47:08,200 --> 04:47:10,200
Up here right?

5613
04:47:10,200 --> 04:47:12,200
Over here.

5614
04:47:12,200 --> 04:47:14,200
Huh?

5615
04:47:14,200 --> 04:47:16,200
Down here?

5616
04:47:16,200 --> 04:47:18,200
Wait where do I go?

5617
04:47:28,200 --> 04:47:30,200
Where do I go?

5618
04:47:30,200 --> 04:47:32,200
I won't let me go anywhere.

5619
04:47:34,200 --> 04:47:36,200
Between the drawings and the tv.

5620
04:47:36,200 --> 04:47:38,200
What?

5621
04:47:42,200 --> 04:47:44,200
Thought I'm right?

5622
04:47:44,200 --> 04:47:46,200
Oh.

5623
04:47:46,200 --> 04:47:48,200
No.

5624
04:47:50,200 --> 04:47:52,200
It's not letting me.

5625
04:47:56,200 --> 04:47:58,200
Follow the red path in the drawing.

5626
04:47:58,200 --> 04:48:00,200
But both are not letting me.

5627
04:48:00,200 --> 04:48:02,200
Both are not letting me.

5628
04:48:08,200 --> 04:48:10,200
But I can't go anywhere.

5629
04:48:10,200 --> 04:48:12,200
I can't.

5630
04:48:14,200 --> 04:48:16,200
There's a third pile?

5631
04:48:16,200 --> 04:48:18,200
Oh.

5632
04:48:18,200 --> 04:48:20,200
Oh.

5633
04:48:20,200 --> 04:48:22,200
Oh.

5634
04:48:24,200 --> 04:48:26,200
Oh.

5635
04:48:30,200 --> 04:48:32,200
Oh okay.

5636
04:48:38,200 --> 04:48:40,200
And then

5637
04:48:40,200 --> 04:48:42,200
green.

5638
04:48:42,200 --> 04:48:44,200
We use the green one to draw.

5639
04:48:44,200 --> 04:48:46,200
Yeah yeah yeah I'm so smart.

5640
04:48:46,200 --> 04:48:48,200
Yeah.

5641
04:48:50,200 --> 04:48:52,200
Oh come on.

5642
04:48:52,200 --> 04:48:54,200
I have to go all the way back around.

5643
04:49:04,200 --> 04:49:06,200
Choose the best option for you and Andy to be together.

5644
04:49:08,200 --> 04:49:10,200
I will.

5645
04:49:10,200 --> 04:49:12,200
Of course I will.

5646
04:49:12,200 --> 04:49:14,200
I need a sneeze.

5647
04:49:18,200 --> 04:49:20,200
That was not a cute sneeze.

5648
04:49:20,200 --> 04:49:22,200
What am I supposed to do here?

5649
04:49:24,200 --> 04:49:26,200
Could you draw this garbage?

5650
04:49:26,200 --> 04:49:28,200
Bless you thank you.

5651
04:49:28,200 --> 04:49:30,200
No?

5652
04:49:30,200 --> 04:49:32,200
The tv and you watch each other.

5653
04:49:32,200 --> 04:49:34,200
More importantly this episode is titled Lay Lay and Lay Lay Alone.

5654
04:49:42,200 --> 04:49:44,200
Pink plush.

5655
04:49:44,200 --> 04:49:46,200
Do I take it?

5656
04:49:46,200 --> 04:49:48,200
Doesn't tight.

5657
04:49:50,200 --> 04:49:52,200
I'll take it.

5658
04:50:02,200 --> 04:50:04,200
Here you guys can have a little plushy party.

5659
04:50:08,200 --> 04:50:10,200
Wait what?

5660
04:50:10,200 --> 04:50:12,200
Father plush won't budge.

5661
04:50:12,200 --> 04:50:14,200
Mother plush won't budge.

5662
04:50:14,200 --> 04:50:16,200
Huh.

5663
04:50:16,200 --> 04:50:18,200
Huh.

5664
04:50:18,200 --> 04:50:20,200
What?

5665
04:50:20,200 --> 04:50:22,200
A stool.

5666
04:50:24,200 --> 04:50:26,200
Pink and green sleep together.

5667
04:50:30,200 --> 04:50:32,200
Oh that's so cute.

5668
04:50:36,200 --> 04:50:38,200
Yellow plush won't budge.

5669
04:50:38,200 --> 04:50:40,200
Who are these colors?

5670
04:50:40,200 --> 04:50:42,200
Supposed to be.

5671
04:50:44,200 --> 04:50:46,200
Why is this locked?

5672
04:50:48,200 --> 04:50:50,200
Hmm.

5673
04:50:52,200 --> 04:50:54,200
Still is red herring?

5674
04:50:54,200 --> 04:50:56,200
What does that mean?

5675
04:50:56,200 --> 04:50:58,200
Huh?

5676
04:50:58,200 --> 04:51:00,200
Can I grab plushies?

5677
04:51:00,200 --> 04:51:02,200
Oh there we go now they budge.

5678
04:51:04,200 --> 04:51:06,200
Put them in the soup like we cooked them.

5679
04:51:06,200 --> 04:51:08,200
Yeah.

5680
04:51:08,200 --> 04:51:10,200
Now what?

5681
04:51:12,200 --> 04:51:14,200
Green is julia and purple is nina.

5682
04:51:14,200 --> 04:51:16,200
Oh.

5683
04:51:16,200 --> 04:51:18,200
An empty spot.

5684
04:51:26,200 --> 04:51:28,200
Green between the purple and yellow.

5685
04:51:30,200 --> 04:51:32,200
Wait I'm supposed to put green between the two girls?

5686
04:51:36,200 --> 04:51:38,200
But isn't green andy?

5687
04:51:38,200 --> 04:51:40,200
Green andy?

5688
04:51:44,200 --> 04:51:46,200
Yeah?

5689
04:51:46,200 --> 04:51:48,200
And I'm supposed to put him between the two girls?

5690
04:51:52,200 --> 04:51:54,200
You need to get the Andrew plush

5691
04:51:54,200 --> 04:51:56,200
but read its description of the green plush.

5692
04:52:00,200 --> 04:52:02,200
That's the point.

5693
04:52:08,200 --> 04:52:10,200
Good night.

5694
04:52:10,200 --> 04:52:12,200
Good night.

5695
04:52:12,200 --> 04:52:14,200
Good night.

5696
04:52:14,200 --> 04:52:16,200
Good night.

5697
04:52:16,200 --> 04:52:18,200
So I'm supposed to place the green plush?

5698
04:52:18,200 --> 04:52:20,200
Really?

5699
04:52:22,200 --> 04:52:24,200
I don't want to.

5700
04:52:30,200 --> 04:52:32,200
Okay.

5701
04:52:32,200 --> 04:52:34,200
Can it really?

5702
04:52:34,200 --> 04:52:36,200
Yes it can.

5703
04:52:44,200 --> 04:52:46,200
What do I do?

5704
04:52:50,200 --> 04:52:52,200
Oh purple hussy.

5705
04:52:52,200 --> 04:52:54,200
Yellow flusy.

5706
04:52:54,200 --> 04:52:56,200
Do I put them in the trash?

5707
04:52:58,200 --> 04:53:00,200
Oh! One goes in the trash.

5708
04:53:00,200 --> 04:53:02,200
Hold on.

5709
04:53:02,200 --> 04:53:04,200
Which one do I put in the...

5710
04:53:04,200 --> 04:53:06,200
Does it matter?

5711
04:53:10,200 --> 04:53:12,200
Does it matter which one goes in the trash?

5712
04:53:14,200 --> 04:53:16,200
Yellow?

5713
04:53:16,200 --> 04:53:18,200
Yellow in the trash?

5714
04:53:18,200 --> 04:53:20,200
It matters. Yellow is trash.

5715
04:53:20,200 --> 04:53:22,200
Okay.

5716
04:53:30,200 --> 04:53:32,200
It matters but I'll let you do it again

5717
04:53:32,200 --> 04:53:34,200
if you get it wrong.

5718
04:53:34,200 --> 04:53:36,200
Oh it'll let you do it again.

5719
04:53:38,200 --> 04:53:40,200
Put Andrew in the cage.

5720
04:53:42,200 --> 04:53:44,200
Put him in the cage.

5721
04:53:44,200 --> 04:53:46,200
Got the best thing in the world.

5722
04:53:50,200 --> 04:53:52,200
In the cage you go.

5723
04:53:52,200 --> 04:53:54,200
Are we free?

5724
04:54:00,200 --> 04:54:02,200
Huh?

5725
04:54:08,200 --> 04:54:10,200
Do I put the knife here?

5726
04:54:12,200 --> 04:54:14,200
Oh which one do I put?

5727
04:54:24,200 --> 04:54:26,200
Read the plaque?

5728
04:54:26,200 --> 04:54:28,200
Oh shit!

5729
04:54:28,200 --> 04:54:30,200
Flowers.

5730
04:54:30,200 --> 04:54:32,200
Oh your choice.

5731
04:54:34,200 --> 04:54:36,200
Oh shit.

5732
04:54:38,200 --> 04:54:40,200
It doesn't say anything.

5733
04:54:40,200 --> 04:54:42,200
Oh the plaque over there.

5734
04:54:42,200 --> 04:54:44,200
An emerald evening.

5735
04:54:46,200 --> 04:54:48,200
Okay I put the flowers.

5736
04:54:50,200 --> 04:54:52,200
Huh?

5737
04:54:52,200 --> 04:54:54,200
A broken heart.

5738
04:54:56,200 --> 04:54:58,200
A broken heart.

5739
04:55:02,200 --> 04:55:04,200
Once upon a lousy life.

5740
04:55:06,200 --> 04:55:08,200
The end.

5741
04:55:08,200 --> 04:55:10,200
The order matters.

5742
04:55:10,200 --> 04:55:12,200
Heart, sunshine, broken heart.

5743
04:55:14,200 --> 04:55:16,200
Heart.

5744
04:55:16,200 --> 04:55:18,200
Right?

5745
04:55:26,200 --> 04:55:28,200
Heart.

5746
04:55:30,200 --> 04:55:32,200
Sunshine.

5747
04:55:32,200 --> 04:55:34,200
Broken heart.

5748
04:55:40,200 --> 04:55:42,200
Somehow it seems a highly question

5749
04:55:42,200 --> 04:55:44,200
what I do to take this route.

5750
04:55:46,200 --> 04:55:48,200
I know what I'm about.

5751
04:55:56,200 --> 04:55:58,200
There's nothing on any of these.

5752
04:55:58,200 --> 04:56:00,200
Classmates.

5753
04:56:06,200 --> 04:56:08,200
Parents.

5754
04:56:14,200 --> 04:56:16,200
Dotkey.

5755
04:56:16,200 --> 04:56:18,200
Siblings.

5756
04:56:22,200 --> 04:56:24,200
Friends.

5757
04:56:26,200 --> 04:56:28,200
I don't want to unlock him.

5758
04:56:36,200 --> 04:56:38,200
Am I supposed to do something with him and put him on a plaque?

5759
04:56:40,200 --> 04:56:42,200
Some of them change.

5760
04:56:46,200 --> 04:56:48,200
Siblings.

5761
04:56:48,200 --> 04:56:50,200
Eat it.

5762
04:56:50,200 --> 04:56:52,200
Read it again.

5763
04:56:52,200 --> 04:56:54,200
Friends.

5764
04:56:56,200 --> 04:56:58,200
Parents.

5765
04:57:00,200 --> 04:57:02,200
I'm reading it.

5766
04:57:02,200 --> 04:57:04,200
They're all the same.

5767
04:57:04,200 --> 04:57:06,200
Classmates.

5768
04:57:06,200 --> 04:57:08,200
They're all the same. All the plaques are the same.

5769
04:57:10,200 --> 04:57:12,200
Do I put Andy somewhere?

5770
04:57:14,200 --> 04:57:16,200
You put him on the pedestals. Which one?

5771
04:57:18,200 --> 04:57:20,200
Which one though? All of them?

5772
04:57:26,200 --> 04:57:28,200
Oh. Oh, okay.

5773
04:57:32,200 --> 04:57:34,200
Soulmates.

5774
04:57:38,200 --> 04:57:40,200
I get it now.

5775
04:57:42,200 --> 04:57:44,200
Family.

5776
04:57:48,200 --> 04:57:50,200
This is kind of cute.

5777
04:57:56,200 --> 04:57:58,200
Friends.

5778
04:57:58,200 --> 04:58:00,200
Oh, it's a demon.

5779
04:58:04,200 --> 04:58:06,200
The lemon cupcake memory is back.

5780
04:58:08,200 --> 04:58:10,200
Oh, what are you doing here?

5781
04:58:10,200 --> 04:58:12,200
Penny for your thoughts?

5782
04:58:12,200 --> 04:58:14,200
No deal. Come on, give me one word.

5783
04:58:16,200 --> 04:58:18,200
Mordifying.

5784
04:58:18,200 --> 04:58:20,200
Is this supposed to be the fucking sex ending? Where's the sex?

5785
04:58:20,200 --> 04:58:22,200
Look very closely at me.

5786
04:58:26,200 --> 04:58:28,200
Mordifying.

5787
04:58:32,200 --> 04:58:34,200
Oh, she's got a bite mark on her.

5788
04:58:36,200 --> 04:58:38,200
Big words don't fit in your mouth.

5789
04:58:38,200 --> 04:58:40,200
Yeah?

5790
04:58:40,200 --> 04:58:42,200
Something else.

5791
04:58:42,200 --> 04:58:44,200
Are you gay?

5792
04:58:44,200 --> 04:58:46,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5793
04:58:46,200 --> 04:58:50,200
Emmy, do you think we can have the same relationship as Ashley and Andrew have?

5794
04:58:50,200 --> 04:58:54,200
Because in desperate need, won't you help your brother out?

5795
04:58:54,200 --> 04:58:56,200
I've been giving you tips so far,

5796
04:58:56,200 --> 04:58:58,200
but do you take all kinds of tips?

5797
04:58:58,200 --> 04:59:00,200
Even mine?

5798
04:59:20,200 --> 04:59:22,200
Sorry.

5799
04:59:24,200 --> 04:59:26,200
Yes.

5800
04:59:26,200 --> 04:59:28,200
Yeah, I'll take all kinds of tips from you.

5801
04:59:32,200 --> 04:59:34,200
Oh, yeah.

5802
04:59:34,200 --> 04:59:36,200
So mortified, are you?

5803
04:59:38,200 --> 04:59:40,200
You know I'm easy to distract.

5804
04:59:42,200 --> 04:59:44,200
So guilty conscious you got.

5805
04:59:44,200 --> 04:59:46,200
Guilty conscious you got.

5806
04:59:50,200 --> 04:59:52,200
KISS! KISS! KISS! KISS! KISS!

5807
04:59:52,200 --> 04:59:54,200
Come here, you.

5808
04:59:56,200 --> 04:59:58,200
Oh my god!

5809
05:00:00,200 --> 05:00:02,200
The vision ends without you dying.

5810
05:00:02,200 --> 05:00:04,200
So at least there's that, I suppose.

5811
05:00:06,200 --> 05:00:08,200
Choker tug there? Oh fuck, I didn't see it.

5812
05:00:08,200 --> 05:00:10,200
Oh fuck, damn it, okay.

5813
05:00:10,200 --> 05:00:12,200
Well...

5814
05:00:12,200 --> 05:00:14,200
Do you wonder if Andrew saw it too?

5815
05:00:14,200 --> 05:00:16,200
Wait!

5816
05:00:16,200 --> 05:00:18,200
Wait!

5817
05:00:18,200 --> 05:00:20,200
They didn't actually just do it?

5818
05:00:20,200 --> 05:00:22,200
That was all a dream.

5819
05:00:26,200 --> 05:00:28,200
Mayhaps...

5820
05:00:28,200 --> 05:00:30,200
Oh shit, you're awake.

5821
05:00:30,200 --> 05:00:32,200
Well hello to you too.

5822
05:00:32,200 --> 05:00:34,200
Yeah, good morning or evening, I guess.

5823
05:00:34,200 --> 05:00:36,200
Whatever.

5824
05:00:36,200 --> 05:00:38,200
Right, so you're awake.

5825
05:00:38,200 --> 05:00:40,200
Whatever.

5826
05:00:40,200 --> 05:00:42,200
Right, so hey, did you get a vision?

5827
05:00:46,200 --> 05:00:48,200
Probably not.

5828
05:00:50,200 --> 05:00:54,200
Really? Do you see dreams like that a lot then?

5829
05:00:54,200 --> 05:00:56,200
I don't.

5830
05:00:56,200 --> 05:00:58,200
So you did see it?

5831
05:01:00,200 --> 05:01:02,200
Quite the vision, huh big brother?

5832
05:01:02,200 --> 05:01:04,200
That was not a vision.

5833
05:01:04,200 --> 05:01:06,200
The demon is messing with us.

5834
05:01:06,200 --> 05:01:08,200
Yeah, that's it, that's just it.

5835
05:01:08,200 --> 05:01:10,200
It's because we tried to be cheap

5836
05:01:10,200 --> 05:01:12,200
and get two visions for the price of one.

5837
05:01:12,200 --> 05:01:14,200
So it gave us a fake vision instead.

5838
05:01:14,200 --> 05:01:16,200
That's the only explanation that makes sense.

5839
05:01:18,200 --> 05:01:20,200
Oh please.

5840
05:01:20,200 --> 05:01:22,200
I mean, it is your...

5841
05:01:22,200 --> 05:01:24,200
It is your trinket, clearly you were right

5842
05:01:24,200 --> 05:01:26,200
and I wasn't supposed to use it.

5843
05:01:26,200 --> 05:01:28,200
Sure, sure, keep selling it, I'm totally buying it.

5844
05:01:28,200 --> 05:01:30,200
He's on Coville.

5845
05:01:32,200 --> 05:01:34,200
Yeah, you just might!

5846
05:01:34,200 --> 05:01:36,200
Fuck off, do you honestly think that?

5847
05:01:36,200 --> 05:01:38,200
Yes, yes.

5848
05:01:38,200 --> 05:01:40,200
I don't know, you tell me.

5849
05:01:40,200 --> 05:01:42,200
Listen here, you.

5850
05:01:42,200 --> 05:01:44,200
Fucking spare me, I don't want to hear it.

5851
05:01:44,200 --> 05:01:46,200
You just helped me...

5852
05:01:46,200 --> 05:01:48,200
You just helped me desecrate our parents' corpses.

5853
05:01:48,200 --> 05:01:50,200
Yet getting laid is what you're freaking out about?

5854
05:01:52,200 --> 05:01:54,200
No one got laid.

5855
05:01:54,200 --> 05:01:56,200
And you keep telling me I messed up.

5856
05:01:56,200 --> 05:01:58,200
What a joke.

5857
05:01:58,200 --> 05:02:00,200
It's okay, cope.

5858
05:02:04,200 --> 05:02:06,200
We're not like that, are we?

5859
05:02:06,200 --> 05:02:08,200
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

5860
05:02:10,200 --> 05:02:12,200
I don't know.

5861
05:02:14,200 --> 05:02:16,200
You just come off that way sometimes.

5862
05:02:16,200 --> 05:02:18,200
How so?

5863
05:02:18,200 --> 05:02:20,200
Attach jealous? Oh dear.

5864
05:02:20,200 --> 05:02:22,200
What's that, wishful thinking?

5865
05:02:22,200 --> 05:02:24,200
Tell it to my ex.

5866
05:02:24,200 --> 05:02:26,200
Let's not pretend you don't have a bit of jealous...

5867
05:02:26,200 --> 05:02:28,200
jealous streak yourself.

5868
05:02:28,200 --> 05:02:30,200
Now that's wishful thinking.

5869
05:02:30,200 --> 05:02:32,200
That chance to get over yourself.

5870
05:02:32,200 --> 05:02:34,200
Sigh.

5871
05:02:34,200 --> 05:02:36,200
Yeah, he's so in denial.

5872
05:02:36,200 --> 05:02:38,200
I don't think I need to ask you this,

5873
05:02:38,200 --> 05:02:40,200
but let me anyways.

5874
05:02:40,200 --> 05:02:42,200
It's never gonna come to that, right?

5875
05:02:42,200 --> 05:02:44,200
You and me?

5876
05:02:48,200 --> 05:02:50,200
Never say never.

5877
05:02:50,200 --> 05:02:52,200
Never.

5878
05:02:54,200 --> 05:02:56,200
Never say never, Andrew, my dear.

5879
05:02:56,200 --> 05:02:58,200
Oh my fucking god.

5880
05:03:00,200 --> 05:03:02,200
It's not funny, don't joke about this.

5881
05:03:02,200 --> 05:03:04,200
Why am I getting your hopes up?

5882
05:03:04,200 --> 05:03:06,200
Or maybe something else?

5883
05:03:06,200 --> 05:03:08,200
Every time I laugh, I have to cough.

5884
05:03:10,200 --> 05:03:12,200
Say, did that vision get you?

5885
05:03:12,200 --> 05:03:14,200
I'm out of here.

5886
05:03:14,200 --> 05:03:16,200
Why is this such a massive issue to you?

5887
05:03:16,200 --> 05:03:18,200
We've done worse things together.

5888
05:03:18,200 --> 05:03:20,200
We have?

5889
05:03:22,200 --> 05:03:24,200
I honestly figured it would happen eventually.

5890
05:03:24,200 --> 05:03:26,200
Why, why, why, why are you like this?

5891
05:03:26,200 --> 05:03:28,200
Why would you say this?

5892
05:03:28,200 --> 05:03:30,200
Why would you think this?

5893
05:03:30,200 --> 05:03:32,200
Wow, what a landmine, huh?

5894
05:03:32,200 --> 05:03:34,200
Well, yeah.

5895
05:03:34,200 --> 05:03:36,200
Forget this, forget this whole thing.

5896
05:03:36,200 --> 05:03:38,200
Fine, that was clearly a vision,

5897
05:03:38,200 --> 05:03:40,200
so it'll probably come up sooner or later.

5898
05:03:42,200 --> 05:03:44,200
Well, in your last vision,

5899
05:03:44,200 --> 05:03:46,200
a guy slid her throat to it. Here we are.

5900
05:03:46,200 --> 05:03:48,200
So, let's leave it at that.

5901
05:03:48,200 --> 05:03:50,200
No, stop being in denial.

5902
05:03:50,200 --> 05:03:52,200
Alright, then if you say so.

5903
05:03:56,200 --> 05:03:58,200
Anyway, let's go through Mom and Dad

5904
05:03:58,200 --> 05:04:00,200
into the ocean, yeah?

5905
05:04:00,200 --> 05:04:02,200
Yeah?

5906
05:04:02,200 --> 05:04:04,200
Yeah, we need to corrupt him more.

5907
05:04:04,200 --> 05:04:06,200
Do we go back to the car now?

5908
05:04:12,200 --> 05:04:14,200
Do we break in someone else's car?

5909
05:04:20,200 --> 05:04:22,200
This way is nothing more than parking spots.

5910
05:04:22,200 --> 05:04:24,200
Oh.

5911
05:04:34,200 --> 05:04:36,200
Ah!

5912
05:04:36,200 --> 05:04:38,200
Oh.

5913
05:04:42,200 --> 05:04:44,200
I hate you.

5914
05:04:46,200 --> 05:04:48,200
I don't care, hurry up and pick them up.

5915
05:04:48,200 --> 05:04:50,200
Ah!

5916
05:04:50,200 --> 05:04:52,200
Sorry.

5917
05:04:52,200 --> 05:04:54,200
Is that it?

5918
05:04:56,200 --> 05:04:58,200
Thank God no one is here at this hour.

5919
05:05:00,200 --> 05:05:02,200
Am I almost done or is there like a lot more?

5920
05:05:04,200 --> 05:05:06,200
Can you tell me?

5921
05:05:08,200 --> 05:05:10,200
Well, let me...

5922
05:05:10,200 --> 05:05:12,200
I need to get this.

5923
05:05:14,200 --> 05:05:16,200
Okay.

5924
05:05:16,200 --> 05:05:18,200
Almost done.

5925
05:05:20,200 --> 05:05:22,200
Okay, so don't stray too far into the light.

5926
05:05:22,200 --> 05:05:24,200
Just in case someone does pass by.

5927
05:05:26,200 --> 05:05:28,200
How do I do that?

5928
05:05:28,200 --> 05:05:30,200
Where am I supposed to...

5929
05:05:34,200 --> 05:05:36,200
Huh?

5930
05:05:36,200 --> 05:05:38,200
Oh wait, I'm supposed to...

5931
05:05:38,200 --> 05:05:40,200
Oh, right, right, right.

5932
05:05:40,200 --> 05:05:42,200
Throw them into the ocean.

5933
05:05:44,200 --> 05:05:46,200
Since my bag broke, how do we make sure the skulls sink?

5934
05:05:46,200 --> 05:05:48,200
They'll probably be fine.

5935
05:05:48,200 --> 05:05:50,200
Well, in that case.

5936
05:05:50,200 --> 05:05:52,200
But I can throw further than you.

5937
05:05:54,200 --> 05:05:56,200
Bet you can't.

5938
05:05:56,200 --> 05:05:58,200
Oh yeah, definitely.

5939
05:05:58,200 --> 05:06:00,200
On the count of three.

5940
05:06:02,200 --> 05:06:04,200
One, two...

5941
05:06:04,200 --> 05:06:06,200
Ah!

5942
05:06:06,200 --> 05:06:08,200
Ooh, what's that? Looks like I won!

5943
05:06:08,200 --> 05:06:10,200
Filthy cheat!

5944
05:06:10,200 --> 05:06:12,200
Nope, you never said pushing wasn't allowed.

5945
05:06:12,200 --> 05:06:14,200
Oh yeah?

5946
05:06:14,200 --> 05:06:16,200
Well, here's your fucking prize Jackass.

5947
05:06:16,200 --> 05:06:18,200
It's a fist to the face.

5948
05:06:18,200 --> 05:06:20,200
Aww.

5949
05:06:20,200 --> 05:06:22,200
A hug. Why thank you, thank you.

5950
05:06:23,200 --> 05:06:25,200
I love her screech.

5951
05:06:30,200 --> 05:06:32,200
Fuck, I hate seeing couples happy.

5952
05:06:32,200 --> 05:06:34,200
Goddamn fuck you.

5953
05:06:34,200 --> 05:06:36,200
You're a little different lately.

5954
05:06:36,200 --> 05:06:38,200
Am I no fun anymore?

5955
05:06:40,200 --> 05:06:42,200
Let me think.

5956
05:06:42,200 --> 05:06:44,200
Have you been sleeping lately?

5957
05:06:44,200 --> 05:06:46,200
Are you actually looking for a fight?

5958
05:06:48,200 --> 05:06:50,200
I'm not talking about that, I just mean in general.

5959
05:06:50,200 --> 05:06:52,200
You're an insomnia and nightmares.

5960
05:06:52,200 --> 05:06:54,200
How are those?

5961
05:06:54,200 --> 05:06:56,200
It's been decent all things considered.

5962
05:06:56,200 --> 05:06:58,200
Yeah.

5963
05:06:58,200 --> 05:07:00,200
Unexpectedly, you seem to be doing just fine.

5964
05:07:00,200 --> 05:07:02,200
We're a happy couple.

5965
05:07:06,200 --> 05:07:08,200
We are.

5966
05:07:10,200 --> 05:07:12,200
I'm trying to self-insert, I'm trying!

5967
05:07:12,200 --> 05:07:14,200
Well, don't be happy for me or anything.

5968
05:07:16,200 --> 05:07:18,200
Andy is all grown up and he doesn't need me anymore.

5969
05:07:18,200 --> 05:07:20,200
Andy is dead, I don't think he needs anything.

5970
05:07:22,200 --> 05:07:24,200
Even so, there's the trinket too.

5971
05:07:24,200 --> 05:07:26,200
You're apparently the one, the only one allowed to use it, so there's that.

5972
05:07:26,200 --> 05:07:28,200
I don't know about that, but it certainly showed me one way to keep him around.

5973
05:07:28,200 --> 05:07:30,200
I suppose.

5974
05:07:30,200 --> 05:07:32,200
Right, I'm honestly pissed.

5975
05:07:32,200 --> 05:07:34,200
We don't know what's coming next.

5976
05:07:34,200 --> 05:07:36,200
It's really hard to plan what to do now.

5977
05:07:36,200 --> 05:07:38,200
Ah, right, so what do we do?

5978
05:07:38,200 --> 05:07:40,200
The money has brought us, has brought us some time,

5979
05:07:40,200 --> 05:07:42,200
but we still need to find ourselves newer again.

5980
05:07:42,200 --> 05:07:44,200
Are you okay?

5981
05:07:44,200 --> 05:07:46,200
Why are you acting like that?

5982
05:07:46,200 --> 05:07:48,200
I'm sorry.

5983
05:07:48,200 --> 05:07:50,200
I'm sorry.

5984
05:07:50,200 --> 05:07:52,200
I'm sorry.

5985
05:07:52,200 --> 05:07:54,200
I'm sorry.

5986
05:07:54,200 --> 05:07:56,200
I'm sorry.

5987
05:07:56,200 --> 05:07:58,200
I'm sorry.

5988
05:07:58,200 --> 05:08:00,200
Are you okay?

5989
05:08:00,200 --> 05:08:02,200
Why are you acting so gay?

5990
05:08:02,200 --> 05:08:04,200
I hate hearing couples happy,

5991
05:08:04,200 --> 05:08:06,200
but I thought we were one.

5992
05:08:06,200 --> 05:08:08,200
What happened to our promise?

5993
05:08:08,200 --> 05:08:10,200
I'm sorry, you're right.

5994
05:08:10,200 --> 05:08:12,200
We are a happy couple.

5995
05:08:16,200 --> 05:08:18,200
No, I wouldn't hate us as a happy couple.

5996
05:08:22,200 --> 05:08:24,200
Can't we just live in the car

5997
05:08:24,200 --> 05:08:26,200
and mug random people for a living?

5998
05:08:26,200 --> 05:08:28,200
That's just not going to work

5999
05:08:28,200 --> 05:08:30,200
for very long.

6000
05:08:30,200 --> 05:08:32,200
Every time we try our luck,

6001
05:08:32,200 --> 05:08:34,200
we're more likely to get caught.

6002
05:08:36,200 --> 05:08:38,200
Then we can't buy fake identities.

6003
05:08:38,200 --> 05:08:40,200
I know, people do that sometimes.

6004
05:08:40,200 --> 05:08:42,200
I know people do that sometimes.

6005
05:08:42,200 --> 05:08:44,200
Point me to the guy who sells them,

6006
05:08:44,200 --> 05:08:46,200
and I'll get right on that.

6007
05:08:46,200 --> 05:08:48,200
The cultist club seems like a really sketchy spot.

6008
05:08:50,200 --> 05:08:52,200
We do have something special.

6009
05:08:56,200 --> 05:08:58,200
Maybe someone there knows who sells them.

6010
05:08:58,200 --> 05:09:00,200
Probably not, though.

6011
05:09:00,200 --> 05:09:02,200
Stop being such a defeatist.

6012
05:09:02,200 --> 05:09:04,200
Let's go and take a look-see.

6013
05:09:04,200 --> 05:09:06,200
It's a crap idea.

6014
05:09:06,200 --> 05:09:08,200
It's a crap idea to go anywhere near where the guy...

6015
05:09:08,200 --> 05:09:10,200
It's a crap idea to go anywhere near

6016
05:09:10,200 --> 05:09:12,200
where we killed that guy.

6017
05:09:12,200 --> 05:09:14,200
Also, that motel was the only one

6018
05:09:14,200 --> 05:09:16,200
letting us stay with cash only.

6019
05:09:16,200 --> 05:09:18,200
Fine, but we're leaving the car

6020
05:09:18,200 --> 05:09:20,200
in the random parking lot

6021
05:09:20,200 --> 05:09:22,200
since there's definitely an ongoing

6022
05:09:22,200 --> 05:09:24,200
investigation for that hitman's death.

6023
05:09:24,200 --> 05:09:26,200
I have to cease again.

6024
05:09:32,200 --> 05:09:34,200
Never mind, it was Leon.

6025
05:09:34,200 --> 05:09:36,200
Alright, cool, whatever, let's get going.

6026
05:09:40,200 --> 05:09:42,200
I had a mold here?

6027
05:09:42,200 --> 05:09:44,200
Are you coming or what?

6028
05:09:44,200 --> 05:09:46,200
In a minute, let me finish this.

6029
05:09:48,200 --> 05:09:50,200
Waste of time and money, I love it.

6030
05:09:50,200 --> 05:09:52,200
Waste of time and money, I love it.

6031
05:09:54,200 --> 05:09:56,200
Glad to hear it.

6032
05:10:04,200 --> 05:10:06,200
Episode 3 Burial has been updated.

6033
05:10:08,200 --> 05:10:10,200
I'm literally looking up

6034
05:10:10,200 --> 05:10:12,200
when that episode is coming out.

6035
05:10:12,200 --> 05:10:14,200
I can't do this.

6036
05:10:20,200 --> 05:10:22,200
Oh no,

6037
05:10:22,200 --> 05:10:24,200

6038
05:10:24,200 --> 05:10:26,200
for

6039
05:10:34,200 --> 05:10:36,200
that's it, we don't have a release date.

6040
05:10:36,200 --> 05:10:38,200
Oh my god, I'm so sad.

6041
05:10:38,200 --> 05:10:40,200
I'm so sad, I'm so sad.

6042
05:10:42,200 --> 05:10:44,200
I'm so sad, I'm genuinely

6043
05:10:44,200 --> 05:10:46,200
so sad that I can't keep going.

Can I cut it out of the VOD?

I would totally do that.

Right.

6068
05:13:29,900 --> 05:13:30,900
I'm gonna try...

6069
05:13:30,900 --> 05:13:34,900
Yeah, I'm gonna private the VOD, I'm gonna try editing it, and then I'll try re-uploading it.

Are you gay?

6074
05:13:42,900 --> 05:13:44,900
Why are you acting so gay?

6075
05:13:44,900 --> 05:13:47,900
We still going to that hotel after the stream?

6076
05:13:49,900 --> 05:13:53,900
For some reason, I got signed out, and I don't remember my password!

6077

How am I supposed to...?

6078
05:13:56,900 --> 05:13:59,900
I don't remember my password for YouTube, so I don't know how to read it.

6079
05:14:00,900 --> 05:14:03,900
Let me go find my fucking YouTube password.

6080
05:14:06,900 --> 05:14:08,900
One minute, I have to find it.
