Hello.
My f U C A G H E C L E, that I worked so hard to make clan this one working.
Okay, there is real chat.
Hello, thank you for coming from Shibhi's...
I'm not sure if that chat is working completely correctly either,
but thank you for coming from Shibi's stream, how was it! I was there too.

That's like a lot for a poor Canadian like me.
So yeah.
Alright, the next thing on my list is...
Right, for those who listen to the loot audio, give me feedback.
I want feedback.
Like, like, like, like, uh...
Like, hurt my feelings.
Like literally, if you didn't like it, like tell me.
Like, tell me what was wrong with it, you know?
Did we miss the Canadian accent?
I don't think I have a Canadian accent.
It was my French.
My French is very like...
My French is very Canadian.
I went to a French school, like, up until college.
Yeah.
Is my music on?
It is.
I was enrolled in a French school since birth until I went to college.
And then I went to an English college.
Did you have a Patreon as well?
Yes, we do.
It's in the description.
There was an audio.
Bro, you guys don't know?
What the hell?
It was not French immersion.
It was not French immersion.
It was fully French.
We did everything in French at that school.
All the teachers spoke French to us.
I kind of hated it.
But you know, whatever.
Now I learned French.
Ow.
I'm sipping on some tea for my throat.
It was helpful.
Okay, hold on.
I'm scrolling up so I can see if anyone...
Why can't I scroll up?
Fucking YouTube chat.
I had nothing to say about it.
It was my first ASMR.
Oh.
I think your accent is cute.
Oh, thank you.
Okay, well, if you have complaints...
I don't know.
Send me a marshmallow.
Tell me, okay?
Is the delay high?
The delay for chat might be high.
What kind of tea?
It's raspberry tea.
Um...
Oh my god.
What else?
What else?
Okay.
Next I have some slides.
Yup.
Didn't even know there was a voice?
What voice?
Voice?
Thank you for all the support that we've received, by the way, too.
I was so surprised.
I thought there was going to be like 500 people at the debut.
And we had like 2,000 something.
I was like, damn.
I was not expecting that.
I really appreciate that you guys showed up.
I'm not always going to be like...
I'm not always going to be super high energy during streams,
but I'm also not always going to be super low energy.
It just depends on the day.
And today is a sick day.
Right, so I have some slides to show you.
How do I present these?
Okay.
Present.
All right.
Okay.
I gotta go back to old chat.
Okay, there we go.
Um...
Nope, that's the wrong one.
Nope, that's also the wrong one.
Okay, okay.
I'm figuring it out.
I'm figuring it out.
One moment, please.
Window capture.
Sure.
There it is.
All right.
Okay.
Oh.
I hope I don't crop anything out.
There's my...
Maybe I should even put it a little higher up
because chat is kind of covering it.
Here's my 2.0 slides.
So I will mostly talk about myself and then...
And then maybe we can talk about you at the end.
We'll see, we'll see.
And I'll probably answer marshmallow questions too
at the end.
So right, here is the 2.0.
Emmy's list of very important info.
Memorize it all.
You're gonna get tested on it at the end.
Next.
Okay.
Ignore the fact that I'm using camera.
We're pro streamers.
Oh, hi, Mercy.
Good, good, good.
Remember it all.
Okay.
Who is Emmy?
What?
What?
Emmy was living.
Right.
Okay.
Full paw and V-tubing, I know.
Right, so, uh,
Vealer have allowed us to be
open about our PLs.
Obviously, don't go and bother the other girls
about theirs.
If they don't want to say it,
they don't have to say it, you know?
If they want to keep it private, that's okay.
I am not keeping it private
because a lot of you already know.
Right, yeah.
And also, my voice is pretty recognizable.
So, like,
possible lover.
No, it means past life.
Right, yeah.
My voice is really recognizable.
So, to me, it's like,
what's the point?
Unless I had, like, you know,
some closets in my,
some skeletons in my closet to hide.
I don't, but,
you know, if you do, I understand
if you want to hide your past account,
but I'm not going to do that.
Like, and,
God, I'm so scattered brain.
Like, in terms of V-tubers
who join companies doing that,
it's okay, like,
I don't judge the ones who hide it,
but I didn't want to hide it.
So, yeah.
Go watch my other content.
It's really good, and I like it,
so I hope you will also like it.
Who is living?
You just search Liberty on YouTube.
Yeah.
Just how, the way I spelled it here,
you can just search that,
and if you want to go watch the other content.
Oh my God, am I running out of tea already?
I am.
Yes, it's great to be back.
It was so fucking hard.
Staying away from you,
you don't fucking understand.
You don't understand.
You don't understand how hard it was
to not stream.
God, I'm getting voice cracks.
To not stream.
To not tweet.
To not make any videos,
because I had to work on viewer stuff.
It was killing me, bro.
But I'm really happy to be back now,
and I'm really happy to be able
to continue making content for you guys
with the support of viewer.
And the other girls too.
Go support the other girls too.
Right, so,
man,
I'm kind of covering my own,
I'm kind of covering my own thing here.
Oh fuck, I'm locked.
Right.
So don't,
don't go on my old channel
and be like,
guys, I found her,
she's gonna be, she's gonna be,
go subscribe.
Don't do that.
I will announce it myself.
So you don't have to do that.
Okay, don't even worry about it.
Don't go, don't go reading the other channel
and being like,
I found her,
I will do that for you, okay?
I'll make an announcement.
When YouTube stops calling our subscribers,
because I don't want to make an announcement,
and then everyone who comes and subscribes
gets cold.
That's like,
that's annoying.
Sorry, let me, let me try to read chat.
Pretty cool that you can make loot content,
though obviously you have to do other stuff on,
sites other than YouTube.
Oh, what do you mean we have to do other stuff?
We don't have to do anything on,
on any other sites other than YouTube.
Unless you're talking about Patreon content,
but we signed up knowing that we had to do that.
You know someone stupid enough to do that anyways?
Yes,
I know multiple people stupid enough to do that.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Conclusion, good company, I appreciate that.
Yeah.
Next slide.
Next slide, where's my slides?
Okay, there's my slides.
All right, stuff I want to mention.
Five out of ten?
That was, that was like, at least a six out of ten.
Right.
I want to do fanzly streams eventually.
But we will have to wait until around July.
Maybe more, I don't, I don't know.
But at least July,
because I think Strani said like,
oh, we have to establish ourselves on YouTube first.
Yeah, they're very supportive of the talents.
That's why I joined.
Next point.
I'm a little bit mentally ill,
but we're not going to talk about it.
And I will never bring it up to you.
Just know if I do some wax shit,
or if you see some wax shit, you know.
C'est la vie.
Oh yeah, right.
Okay, so I know my shtick is like,
cis con, right?
A sister con,
what does con mean?
Consensual convention.
Blue Twitch?
Oh, you mean fanzly?
Brocon, whatever.
Oh, complex.
Complex.
What does it end with an N if it means complex?
Okay, well.
Yeah, I know my little shtick here is cis con.
My rats are fighting in the background.
Oh my god.
Did you hear that?
Okay, you hear that?
Okay, if I hear that again,
I might have to BRB to separate them.
I'm trying to introduce some new babies to my adults,
and they're kind of not getting along.
Oh my fucking god.
Alright.
What's their names?
You'll see them soon.
In handcams.
Right, so,
I know that my whole shtick is like brocon cis con,
but unfortunately to disappoint you,
we can't do that on Patreon.
I don't even think we can do that on fanzly either.
We have to abide by their TOS.
Yeah, I know that might disappoint some of you,
and you might be like,
oh well why don't you go to this other platform
that does allow that stuff.
You know, the shirt that we could,
but also we're trying to stick to the bigger platforms
that a lot of people have access to
and a lot of people know about.
It's not very smart to go streaming
on smaller platforms,
because then you're just making your...
Oh god, I'm having a brain fart.
When we have the option for a bigger platform,
let's just try that first, right?
Big brain, right? Accessibility, yes, yes, yes.
Accessibility equals growth.
That's what I mean.
Yeah, you don't want to
shoot yourself in the foot right from the start, you know?
Let's just wait until we get banned first,
and then we can go to those platforms.
I'm just kidding, don't ban us, please.
Right, my IRL goals, I have real life goals,
because I'm actually, you know, not...
I'm only part-time anime girl on the internet.
My real life goals is...
I want to move into an apartment with air conditioning.
I want to move into an apartment with air conditioning
because it's summer right now, and...
If something is allowed on Fancy, but not on Patreon,
you can get banned from Patreon for doing it on Fancy.
Shit, yeah.
So, no Bokon, I guess, on Fancy.
Yeah, I don't have air conditioning.
A lot of apartments don't come with air conditioning,
so I want to move to one that does
because it's going to be summer soon,
and if I, you know,
if I am able to do that,
that helps me be able to stream longer,
and it helps me be able to make more content
because I will be comfortable during the summer,
because I have to keep my stream short for now
because I can't stream for long hours in the heat without AC.
So, yeah.
What did GB say?
Scroll up.
Pomf?
Yeah, some people said pomf.
Yeah, some people said pomf.
I don't know if we'll go there.
Right, yeah.
Next goal is I want to get a big girl microphone.
I feel like I'm using such a newbie microphone right now.
I'm using the HyperX,
and I don't know, I'm sure the quality is okay.
But I want to get like a really professional one, yeah.
Something expensive,
something I can waste my money on.
It sounds good.
Yeah, I'm sure the quality is good,
but I want something like,
I want a big girl mic
with lots of cords
to tie you up with.
Next, I want to,
I want to be able to get a dishwasher
and a washing machine
and a dryer for clothes.
I feel like these goals should be pretty realistic.
I feel like I should be able to get these things.
So, I'm so excited to tweet
a picture of my new washing machine
and to be like, guys!
I got a washing machine!
Wait, we're skipping number three?
Oh, be mentally stable, yeah, that too.
I want to do that too.
Wait, what's she be stick?
Do you live in a cardboard box?
No, I live in an apartment,
but it doesn't really have amenities
because it's not really an apartment.
Okay.
All right.
And the last one is not visible
because the chat is covering it.
I'll be able to afford your membership.
I used to be really, really athletic,
which is crazy to say because now I'm not.
But I want to go back to those days.
I mentioned before that I won a gymnastics award.
Yeah, I used to like do gymnastics.
I don't know if I'll ever go back,
but I want to do something athletic
because it was fun.
Yeah, fat-shaming and chat?
What?
Who's fat-shaming and chat?
The only one around here that's allowed to fat-shame is me.
I'm kidding.
I won't be fat-shaming anyone.
Right.
Next.
What does Imi like under the shats?
I don't know.
Okay.
Let me know if I'm being too rude too quickly.
I don't know how quickly we want to advance here, but...
Will there be some content on YouTube to a lesser extent?
I have to consult Strani for that.
I don't know what YouTube allows.
I would get bonked all the time on YouTube in the past.
I'm still getting bonked to this day on YouTube.
Guys, guys, I...
You know how YouTube is like removing ear-licking content
and deleting people's channels for ear-licking content?
But I still have ear-licking content up.
I mean, what YouTube execs?
No, I would never do ear-licking content.
I don't do that.
Wait, wait, wait.
So in the...
In the what?
In the trailer,
my voice line was like,
what, you've never seen a masochistic bracket before?
Which to me is kind of a silly trailer line,
but Strani sent it to me and I was like, whatever, I'll do it.
So yeah, here's all my masochistic tendencies.
I won't go too in-depth, but I'm also a sadist.
So anything you see here, like, fuck, it goes both ways, you know?
What's Painplay? Exactly what it sounds like.
If you don't know what Painplay is, then what are you doing here?
Weren't you guys just in Shibi's chat? Shouldn't you know?
Yeah, yandere?
Okay.
God, I really am covering everything, aren't I?
I'm sorry for coughing in your ear.
All right, so yandere, right.
Okay, I know it's Mercy's job.
I won't steal her job.
I won't be like, Senpai, you're gonna fucking...
You're gonna eat my ass tonight, right Senpai?
Huh?
I'll tie you down in my basement and force you to sit on you.
No.
I'm not gonna...
Why am I so tiny now?
I'm not gonna steal her thing, okay?
That's her thing.
But you wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me.
Okay, I'm not a Swiftie, but I've been obsessed with that sort of content since seventh grade.
You can't rip it out of me, okay?
I consume an unhealthy amount of that sort of content.
Someone was able to find all of the...
All of the hentai I had put on my coffee table from my debut.
Just from the really shitty Minecraft pixelated tiny little images I had put up.
They found every single one.
So if you wanna go into the debut comment section and read what I like,
go ahead, but I can't say here probably.
Yeah, yeah, I've been...
I think...
Oh fuck.
I can't say how long I've been obsessed with it.
I think I really did.
Oh, whatever.
I've been obsessed with it for way too long.
Longer than some of you Zoomers might be alive for.
Oh yeah, the red goo that comes out of your body.
Peeling skin.
Peeling skin is like really satisfying.
I'm not a fucking hag.
You'll be surprised I'm not a hag.
We do have hags though if you want them.
Yeah, peeling skin.
Okay, my favorite thing about peeling skin.
Not just on your lips, cause also on your lips and on my lips on...
On your lips, from my lips, whatever.
But also just in general like scabs.
I really like to pick sc...
Oh, I got a cough.
Okay.
Let me drink some water.
Right.
I really...
My favorite thing ever is when you're peeling a scab and it makes like a ripping sound.
I don't know if you've ever experienced that cause I'm sure none of you...
I'm sure not everyone here likes to pick scabs.
But I love it when you can hear the skin rip.
That's my favorite thing ever.
And also when you can feel the skin rip, but yeah.
Or talking like dead skin?
Well like, you know, when your lips are dry they start to peel.
How big of a scab are you picking? Any fucking size.
The bigger the better.
It's audible? It is.
If you get a big enough one.
I like popping pim...
Oh, there's a car outside.
I like popping pimples too.
That's satisfying too, but I feel like scabs are better cause they...
They goo.
They goo.
They goo red.
Spanking and chunking.
I am a switch.
I gotta move it for you.
Imi does not read much hentai.
I mostly read dirty books.
But if you have a recommendation, I've been trying to read...
Hold on, I gotta cough again.
I'm a Nintendo switch.
I've been trying to read at least one recommendation from...
Cause a lot of you have been sending full on lists of a bunch of them.
I can't read all of those.
But I try to read one at least from each one.
Any favorite tags?
The ones here!
These ones!
My neighbors are being really loud downstairs.
Genuine love and affection.
Yeah, I just want someone to love me.
That's my ultimate kink.
Non...
Complex.
Also, anything you're into...
If you presented the right way to me,
then I'll probably be into it too.
Yeah.
Next slide.
What does Imi not like under the shats?
Right, right.
Who loves the most degenerative kinks?
I know.
I know that's asking a lot.
I know, I'm really freaky when it comes to that.
Okay, so all of the below stuff I am fine with when it comes to fan art.
This only pertains to elude marshmallows
or just how we interact with each other in general.
Right.
I bet you like hand holding.
Don't you, you little freak?
I hope you can't hear the dog barking.
Let's not my dog either.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Great.
Death or necrophilia.
I may have threatened to have...
gex with your dead body in a past audio.
But I'm not actually into it and please do not do...
I mean, do not send any weird necrophilia stuff to me.
I know, I know we're freaky here,
but let's not go that far, okay?
Let's not go that far.
Right, I'm all about love.
So I'm uncomfortable with any sort of pain play stuff if it's not loving.
Because, you know, I'm just freaky like that.
It's got to be loving.
Do not fuck the dead body.
Actually, right, right, right.
Okay, I'm okay with cutesy stuff.
I really like cutesy stuff.
Or like...
Or like...
You mean freak?
You guys are so funny.
Okay, I'm like, I'm okay with cutesy stuff.
Or like, I didn't know that touching a peepee makes it...
But I don't go Google Gaga.
I don't go into that territory, so...
Go to AC.
Yeah, if you're into that, she will...
She will satisfy you.
And the same thing with the OG-san?
The same thing with the OG-san?
If you don't know, OG-san means like uncle, I guess?
Or maybe like old man?
I'm not really into that either.
So also, yeah, old dudes.
So you can also...
Go to AC for that too.
Because that's her shtick, you know?
Fat older uncle.
Yeah, that's not for me.
Oh, what's the last one?
Alright, the last one is...
Extreme body play stuff, yeah.
Don't fill my tits up with saline solution
and then jump on them to make them pop, okay?
Okay.
And then I won't fill your balls up with saline solution
and then jump on them to make them pop.
It's a mutual agreement there, okay?
Okay.
You need to rest?
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm usually not really sick.
I don't know...
I don't know who I am today.
But I'm okay.
It's really just my throat.
And like my coughing's been acting up.
Oh no, chat fucking broke on me!
Shit!
Oh no, how am I supposed to look at chat?
How am I supposed to read chat?
Okay, let me open my own stream.
Because my chat froze!
Are you kidding me?
Alright.
I will read chat from a tiny window from YouTube.
Okay?
Okay.
What's next?
Let me adjust it because now I have to change my windows around
because my freaking chat froze.
Alright.
I will not pop your balls for you.
No, I'm sorry.
Maybe she will.
If you're into that, I don't know.
Here, let me even just close chat.
Or maybe if I close and then open it again.
It works!
Oh, okay, okay.
I don't have to have the whole YouTube tab open.
Alright.
Pop them like boba?
Chew on them like boba balls?
Yeah, next.
Alright, music stuff.
I didn't mention my music taste in my debut, so I can mention it now.
So, I wrote this when I was like...
It was like 2am last night when I made this slide, so...
I don't know why I said I don't have favorite genres.
I do have favorite genres.
I like Korean pop and Japanese pop and like...
Vocaloids.
I like vocal aids, too.
Yeah.
I'm not into making music or anything.
I don't have a goal of producing an original song or anything.
I mean, if it comes to that...
Sure, I don't know if I can do it, but it's not a goal of mine.
I'm not really passionate about making music or any of that.
But yeah, I put my current favorite songs here so you can listen to them if you want.
I'm kind of a normie and I apologize if you don't like it.
It's not like I'm going to be bothering you with my song choices.
You gifted some fun stuff on Throne. I can't wait to hear it be used.
Dirty.
Shame him.
Oh my god.
What a pervert.
Not on this Christian website, youtube.com.
Mods.
Hang him by his balls and twist him around.
Yeah, I like Takayan. I like Metsuki. I like Romani Martinez.
I recently found out about What's-A-Heart.
I don't know how popular they are.
Yeah, and fuck, now I have to actually show it.
And then there's the last one.
Don't even worry about that.
Or I like some dislikes.
I didn't mention this in my debut either, so let's talk about it here.
I like rats, obviously.
I like rats.
Yeah.
I like pink and cute things.
My whole room is pink.
And my whole room is covered in cute things.
Yeah, I like cute stuffed animals.
I like cute clothes, like Hawaii fashion.
I think I season to that too, like Hawaii fashion.
She sent pictures of her outfits and I was like,
She's like my twin, she's so cute.
I'm sorry if there's any Koreans in chat.
I don't think I'm pronouncing it right.
But it's basically just...
It's like race cakes.
And I like it with...
I like it with like cheesy sauce and stuff and like spicy...
I like it when it's spicy.
I don't know the brand I've been eating.
Let me try to look up the brand because I've been eating this one brand.
I've been eating this one brand like over and over again.
It's like the only...
Oh, fuck wrong tab.
It's like the only thing I've been eating lately.
I think it was spicy chicken.
Wait, what brand is that?
Bulldog, bulldog.
That one, the pink one.
It's really good.
That's right.
Korean perfect pronunciation?
I feel like that's a lie.
Do you want to pick on each hand scabs?
Yes?
Scab picking stream?
No, I don't think that's allowed.
Yeah, bulldog.
I like those.
I think a...
Mukbang stream would be fun.
It's going to have a lot of...
Maybe it could be an ASMR stream.
It's going to have a lot of wet noises.
Eating on each hand scabs.
I don't...
Okay, I don't like to eat this.
Let it be known here.
I don't like to eat the scab skin.
I only like to eat the lip skin, okay?
I feel like scab skin is kind of gross.
I only like the lip skin, okay?
Okay.
Not auto cannibalism.
Well, I guess a little bit of auto cannibalism,
but also other people cannibalism.
Regular cannibalism.
Dislikes, dislikes, right?
I don't like to interact with real humans.
When I had like a real person job,
and not an anime girl on the internet job,
it was so awful.
People are so mean.
I don't like to talk to them.
So now I just spend a lot of time not doing that.
Okay.
She is into that shit.
Well, you know what?
If people are into scab eating,
I'm not gonna king shame them,
but I'm just not into it.
Do you like to pop zits?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Let me sit on your back and pop all your back knee.
That's quality time for me.
Okay.
I don't like people who can sing good
because I'm jealous of them.
I don't like heat.
I don't like being hot or moisture.
I do like to watch Dr. Pimple Popper.
Yes.
I don't like bugs trying to crawl in my ear.
And I have this really specific fear
of bugs crawling in my ear because one time
when I was sleeping, I was really young.
And why is my model?
I was really young and I was just sleeping.
And all of a sudden I felt like
something go inside my ear.
Like I felt a buzzing near my ear
and then I literally felt penetration in my ear.
Like something like crawled into my ear
and I woke up as fast as I could
and I like, you know, put my fingers up to my ear
to see like what the fuck is going on in there.
And I couldn't get anything.
Like there was, it felt like nothing was there.
So I don't, I don't know if I just have
like a dead bug in my ear since, since I was a child.
But now I'm just really, really scared of bugs
crawling into my ear because I don't know if,
I don't know if that was a dream.
I don't know if it's real,
but it felt really real and I hated it.
So yeah.
Next is people who are smart
because I'm jealous because I'm stupid.
Sleep with earplugs.
That's smart, but also I feel like
the earplugs are going to get dirty really quickly
and I'm too lazy to clean those.
Me being piloted by a bug like Ratatouille.
That fly that flew into my ear
has just been controlling my brain.
Okay.
And then finally,
other streamers you watch because I'm jealous.
Don't bring them up in my chat because I will cry.
Hold on, what's the next?
I'm kind of worried about what the next.
Oh shit, okay.
The next one is also, the next slide
is also common knowledge,
but I'm going to say it again
because I know a lot of people, you know,
we just met each other.
A lot of people, you know, don't know me.
So I'm going to give you an important note here.
Right?
Okay, here we go.
So,
I want to bring up right now to warn people
who want me to stay in the little sister character
at all times.
I can't.
Uh oh.
And he thinks her voice,
she's a fucking broadcastle that bitch.
She's a little liar.
Okay, yeah.
So it's true.
I am the only one in viewer who fix her voice.
All the other girls do use their natural voice on stream.
Even if you think like, oh, she's trying so hard.
She's trying so hard to sound mommy
or she's trying to,
she's trying to so hard to sound lolly.
They're not.
I've been in voice calls with these girls.
They all genuinely sound like that.
They all genuinely sound that sexy and hot
and cute and pretty naturally, right?
Except for me.
Except for me.
Okay, yeah.
So I don't know how others do lolly voice 24-7.
Maybe they're born with it.
Like I see.
Or,
yeah.
But your little sister's a fake bitch.
So when she's sick
or maybe during longer streams like Donathons,
big sister in me will come out to play and torment you.
So yeah.
Let me move it.
Okay, there we go.
And there's my little drawing.
I'm sorry if that disappoints anyone,
but I hope you can still like me anyways
and I hope you can put up with dummy sister in me.
You get a full package with me.
You get little sister and older sister.
Okay, that's it.
Yup, yup, yup, yup.
Okay, so I can go through.
Only, and it's only been 43 minutes.
So I can go through safer work marshmallow questions.
Or we can do chat questions.
So, oh, I got a burp.
Don't hold back.
Yeah, ask me your most,
your moist burning questions.
Don't worry about whether or not
management would want me to talk about it.
Just ask it to me.
Yeah, they're not here.
It's just us.
It's just me and you, poopy.
Or we can just talk about like your own interests.
I don't know.
We can get to know each other if you want.
So I think first what I'll do
is go back to the chatting screen.
And nine out of 10, thank you.
And I want to open marshmallow.
And any questions you have,
I will look through those first
and then I will go through chat questions.
Okay.
What color is your panties?
Okay, I'll answer that one
because it's mercy.
They're light blue.
Okay.
Let me open marshmallow.
I think I should be able to show it
if I'm careful.
If I'm careful.
Okay.
I'm going to refresh it.
Okay.
It's good to have you back, lad.
Good luck on your future clothes and stuff.
This is what you've been up to the whole time.
Yup.
Any book recommendations?
Can I show the...
Let me try to show the marshmallow question.
So that way...
Oh!
Oh!
Well, there's my OBS.
There's...
Docs myself.
I hope not. Okay.
Here's a marshmallow question.
Okay, I'll put it right on chat.
Any recommendations for books instead of dojins?
Right.
All of the books I've read will get me canceled
if I say them,
but I guess I'm probably going to get canceled anyways.
So...
The problem is...
She uses...
Guys, she uses OBS.
Fight your IP address right now.
Go to her house.
So, like, all of the books I've read
have been mostly, like,
female, like,
orientated...
Oriented?
So if I tell you, like,
you might not enjoy it because you're a dude.
But I will tell you my all-time favorite.
But let me look it up first
because I forgot the name.
It is really problematic.
But, you know,
we're here today, so whatever.
It's Take Me With You by Nina G. Jones.
That one...
Okay, I might be really bad.
I haven't read it in a long time,
but it was the first...
It was the one I read that I was like,
ah, that's good.
So, I don't know.
Okay, next question.
Have you seen One Piece or Dragon Ball?
I started Dragon Ball,
but I didn't really care about it.
So yeah.
Considering the pin
and button aesthetics on your designs,
are you a fan of Coraline?
Okay, we didn't design our characters at all.
I also didn't apply to be in me,
so I didn't design anything,
but I do like Coraline.
It's a really good movie.
I really, really like it.
I watched it a lot on repeat.
When I was a kid, it really scared me.
I'm sure it scared a lot of kids,
but yeah, I like Coraline.
I saw you played League,
and I started wondering what rank is.
What your rank is.
Okay, I had League on my...
I had League on my like,
Steam library during debut.
I don't play League.
I've played League like maybe a total of five times.
I don't even know if I have a rank.
That's how much I don't know anything about League.
I've only really learned how to play Yumi,
and I don't know any of the other characters,
and I don't know how to play any of the other characters.
Like, I'm not really a League player.
I don't...
I'm sorry to maybe disappoint you,
or also to make you happy,
because a lot of people don't like League.
I don't know.
But I thought it would be a funny game to like,
have chat teach me how to play,
but you know, if you guys don't like it,
we don't have to play.
It's not that deep, you know?
Oh no, Yumi.
Guys, like I said, I haven't played League at all.
Like, don't start freaking out.
Don't start freaking out. It's okay.
If you guys get a fans League account, will it be free?
I think Strani already mentioned that, but yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know how fans League works at all, by the way.
Um...
So if you have, like, fans League questions,
please direct them to Strani,
because I've never used fans League before,
so I don't know.
Will you groom us?
Yes.
Um...
Ooh.
Well, this isn't interesting.
I don't know how fans League works at all, by the way.
I don't know how fans League works at all, by the way.
Well, this is an interesting question.
I barely even read it before showing it to you.
Do you feel like there are equal parts of you
in Yumi as Liberty?
Are there things you're excited to do as Yumi
that you couldn't do before?
I could do anything I wanted as Liberty before.
I just chose not to, you know?
Um...
Equal parts of you in Yumi...
Equal parts of me.
I don't know what that means.
Um...
I...
How do we congregate together outside of streams?
Right.
There's a fan Discord,
but I'm not in it, so we can't.
Um...
Once I announce that my PL is PL,
you're free to go in my old Discord server.
I'm also not in that one.
So you cannot congregate with me outside of streams
other than, like, pre-chat.
But you can congregate with other fans outside of streams.
There's a fan Discord out there on Twitter.
I think you can search for
Feeler Community Server or something.
But we will not have our own...
Is the chat behind Frozen?
I don't know.
We will not have our own, like, Discord server
with us in it, you know?
Yeah.
Also, this question, I'm not quite sure
what you mean by that,
so I don't know if I can answer it.
I do feel like the character's cute.
I like her.
Um, did I expect to get her?
No, not at all.
But yeah, I like her.
I think she's cute.
I'm cute.
Do you feel like Yumi is just as big
of a part of her as Liberty?
Yes, of course. Of course. Of course.
Oh, have you picked up any recent shows?
I am just about finished watching
to your eternity.
It was really, really good.
It was so cute and sad.
I literally cried, like, every five episodes.
I still have to finish watching,
like, maybe the last two episodes or something.
Um, but, yeah.
Yeah.
It was really good.
I really recommend that anime.
It's so sad.
It made me cry so much.
Even thinking about it now, I'm crying.
I'm literally tearing up thinking about it.
Oh, my God.
Fuck that anime.
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, this is an interesting question.
I'm literally wiping away my fucking tears
because it made me cry.
Thinking about the anime.
Have you watched Steins' Gate?
No.
In your lore video,
was that an alternate from Mandela catalog?
Do you also like other analogue horror
or horror in general?
Wait, okay.
We did not come up with our lore.
We had no part.
Oh, my God.
My neighbors are yelling downstairs.
I'm sorry.
We had no part in any of the lore, right?
So, no.
I don't know anything about that.
Apologies.
I do horror stuff, though.
Can we get a taste of your real voice?
Oh, my God.
You can go look that up yourself.
That's so easy to find.
That's really easy to find.
You can find my vods very, very easily.
I'm trying to go back to the old questions.
Oh, I think this is an important question.
Our future schedule is going to be around the same hour,
or are you planning to shift to earlier or later?
For now, I think I will keep it at this time.
I have to cough.
Okay.
For now it will stay here.
I really want to do gorilla streams earlier in the day.
I think that would be fun.
But regularly...
Earlier in the day.
Hours before this one.
For the future.
For the future.
For the future.
Like, hours before this one
For any European viewers
For now, regularly scheduled streams will be at this time

And then I have two other rats that are adults that I've had for a while, and I did get to name those ones, and their names are Dennis, The Menace, and Esteban.
You can tell there's a really big difference between the names.
Do you read any visual novels?
Hmmmmm...
Is... oh, there's one I'm thinking of right now.
I forgot the name.
I read a little bit. I read a little bit, but...
I mostly read, like, manga where I started the anime, and then they stopped, like,
you know, they took a break from making it for, you know, like, the next season and stuff.
Like, I've read most of the New Freerun chapters.
Like, I read manga more than I read visual novels, I feel like.
So, yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, oh, I'm gonna disappoint you guys with this question.
Have you watched Toradora Feelings on Romance Anime?
I have not watched Toradora. I know. Disappointment. Oh my god.
Esteban is a weird name for a female rat.
I got it from... I got it from The Office.
Um, I have not watched Toradora and Feelings on Romance Anime.
This is probably why I haven't watched Toradora.
I don't like romance anime.
Like, as much as I love, like, yeah, didn't stuff.
As kinky as I am for liking love, I don't actually like romance anime.
So, I tend to stay away from a lot of romance anime.
Yeah.
I have not watched Violet...
I tried watching Violet Evergarden, but I got bored.
I'm super, super picky when it comes to anime. I apologize.
This question is so fucking funny.
Every trade, sweet, cuckoo, date a cuckoo.
Have you ever dated a cuckoo?
I guess we know who the cuck is.
Point and laugh at the cuck.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Actually, no, if you're a cuckoo, you should enjoy it.
You should enjoy the humiliation.
Right, um...
I'm sorry?
No.
Um...
No.
But...
Thoughts on the Polly thing?
I've said before, I want two boyfriends.
I want to dress them up like Barbie dolls, like twin Barbie dolls,
and I want to make them kiss.
And I want to watch them...
I want to watch them kissing.
That's my ultimate cuck... cuck fantasy.
That's my ultimate cuck... cuck fantasy.
That's my ultimate cuck... cuck fantasy.
There's so many questions.
Okay, okay, okay.
I feel like I've already answered that one.
How do you want your fan groups to interact?
Interact.
Talk to each other.
I don't know.
But I understand if they don't want to,
because I know the content is different.
I'm not going to be disappointed if everyone from the past is like,
fuck this, I'm not coming.
I understand, I understand.
If you don't want to be here, because the content is different,
I understand and that's okay.
So it's really...
I like you guys to get along,
but also if you don't, that's okay.
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.
Oh my god.
How many rats total have you raised in your life?
God, these questions are so boring.
I'm so sorry to anyone who thought I would be entertaining today.
Not because your questions are boring,
but like my answers are boring.
Okay, okay.
I raised... raised.
I don't think I raised, but I've had...
Six.
Six?
Seven.
Six or seven.
Hold on.
Let me count them.
So my first two were...
My first two were Pikachu and Mudkip.
And then after that...
After that, I also...
After Pikachu died,
you're going to hear a lot about rat deaths.
They die really fast.
So after Pikachu died, I got three more.
I got crackers, I got Esteban, and I got Dennis.
My neighbors are having sex downstairs,
and I can hear it very clearly right now.
I can hear them moaning and also the bed creaking,
and it's making me a little bit uncomfortable.
Is the marble my neighbors have sex downstairs?
Um, yeah, right.
Pikachu?
Pikachu and Mudkip.
Crackers.
Dennis.
Esteban.
Pixie Luna.
That makes seven.
Yeah, that makes seven.
Clap for him.
Cheer them on.
I do have thin floors and thin walls.
Yeah, that's why I want to move.
Tribute raiding stream?
What?
Tribute raiding stream?
What?
Never, bros.
No.
Is it illegal or otherwise not liked to talk about
or ask about previous online identities
with you or the other viewer, bros?
So me, I'm comfortable with it,
but also don't bring it up too much,
because we're here now today.
Let's be in the present, you know?
Let's be...
I should probably show that question.
Let's be in the present together, you know?
But obviously, it's the other viewer girls' choices.
I'm not going to talk about it,
like for them,
like in terms of them,
like I'm not going to tell you,
but if they want to talk about it,
you know, is their choice.
I'm just happy that viewer let us talk about it,
because I miss the people that supported me from the start.
I really appreciate them,
but I also appreciate any new people
that are also coming in and saying hi
and giving me a chance.
Okay, now I'm getting to the inappropriate ones.
Let me scroll back up.
Okay, are you sure I'm not showing those?
Oh my god, they're being so fucking loud right now.
Holy shit.
Here, let me...
I should probably...
You talked about being self-conscious about your real voice.
I went and checked,
and it could still be a little sister.
Lies.
You're gassing me up.
You're sucking my cock so hard right now.
Okay, I guess I'll get into the actual spicy question.
Not spicy, but like...
Okay, where are they?
Oh, what do you plan to do on Fancy?
Okay, well, I do want to play like,
you know, the dating sims.
I think those would be fun.
Yeah, look at my throne.
Yeah, look at my throne if you want to know
what I plan to do on Fancy.
Mom, louder!
Is there your dominance?
You guys are so funny.
I guess I should probably talk about this too.
Okay, since you weren't able to choose your character,
how do you feel about lolly characters and lolly culture in general?
So, I have drawn...
Like, I've been drawing...
I guess I didn't really know at the time.
When I first started drawing,
I was like, only drawing lollies.
And also furries.
I was drawing lollies with furries.
And I didn't really care.
Like, I wasn't like,
oh yeah, shit's hot.
But I also wasn't like totally against it.
There were times where I found some stuff to be a little questionable.
But I know what I'm comfortable with personally.
And I will...
I wouldn't be here if in the present moment,
you know, I wasn't comfortable with it.
And I'm obviously not going to do anything,
but I'm not comfortable with it.
Um...
Yeah, in terms of like...
Like, I am not immersed in the culture.
There's a culture.
I'm very new to this.
I'm very, very new to this.
Like, other than drawing them,
I don't...
I haven't...
I'm not in the culture.
So, I hope you can accept me as...
I don't fucking know part of the family.
Brother?
I don't know.
Yeah, hopefully no one's disappointed that I'm like new to this or anything.
I don't know.
We're being real right now.
Yeah, no one's asking any like crazy questions.
I thought you were going to ask me like...
I don't fucking know like...
How far can you squirt or something?
Okay, I can go to chat questions now, I guess,
for anyone that doesn't have marshmallow,
or doesn't want to use it.
So...
Okay.
We'll educate you.
Thank you, thank you.
That's why I said like send me your recommendations for like,
you know, literature, quality, you know,
literature because I haven't read them.
So, how far?
How far?
Probably only like...
Ah, I want to say like...
Maybe like a little 40 centimeters?
Not far.
Not far.
Oh shit, chat just fucking broke for me again.
No, no, no, we're good.
What are your thoughts on fashion?
What do you mean fashion?
Not 47, just 40, 40, 40, 40, 40.
Don't get your hopes up now.
Is that impressive?
Can we talk about this?
I'm very, very not...
I'm very, very unfamiliar with like YouTube rules.
If I get bonked on YouTube, I apologize.
How do we use marshmallow?
It's the link in the description,
and you just type your thing and you send it,
and you can use like a translator
on like a Google Chrome extension translator
because the website isn't in Japanese.
Would you rather be inflated with liquid like water
or juice or with gas like air?
Inflation, okay.
Okay, let me think about it critically here.
If I had to choose, I feel like...
Juice is a bad idea.
I feel like juice is asking to get some kind of infection
inside of my body.
So, I'm going to say...
I'm going to say whatever is the safest,
so either water or air, yeah.
Or if I could choose probably none of them.
My chat is so laggy.
I have a lot of trouble seeing it.
Maybe I should reload it again.
Chat.
Oh, if you could have picked your character,
what would you have done?
Okay, here was my mindset going in.
My mindset was...
I don't suit any of the characters.
I thought maybe I would suit stabs,
but even now looking at Mercy, I was like,
damn, Mercy is literally Mercy.
Like, I don't...
She's not me.
So, I didn't really think I would suit any of them.
So, I kind of went in hoping for an interview
so I could get the experience.
I was hoping for an interview
so I could get the experience of an interview
because I've had the experience of an interview
before.
And I thought it would be good practice.
I don't know how to explain.
It was kind of a stupid mindset.
I was like, you know what?
You know what?
I might get an interview,
so let me try to get the experience of that.
And then will I actually get accepted?
Probably not, but I'll do the interview.
And then, you know, down the line,
if I apply to Hollow Life,
I'll be super pro because I'll know how to...
I'll know how to talk to them
because I've had two freakin' other VTuber interviews.
Yeah.
Does the rats really stay on during...
Yes, it does.
Yes, it does.
Yeah, unless you can get used to them.
Yeah, because during my first VTuber interview ever
with unnamed company,
it was really, really scary.
And it was...
I did not do a good job.
So I understand why they didn't choose me.
But he...
I didn't...
It was really nerve-wracking.
Little did I fucking know
that the VLR didn't even give me an interview.
They didn't give any of the girls an interview.
So I didn't get any interview experience.
Yeah.
You're in Hollow Life already, Imi-chan.
Thank you.
Aww.
Do you have some sort of routine
to prepare for the lulley voice?
No, I don't.
I just do it.
And that's probably why my throat
is fucked up right now.
But no, I don't.
I just do it.
It's probably smarter if I do.
Yeah.
I thought you liked footskin as well.
I do, I do.
Kind of a shame to admit
that I also like to eat my footskin.
But I feel like I wouldn't want to eat your footskin.
I feel like I know where my feet have been,
so I'm comfortable with eating my footskin
because it's like,
I wash my feet really well
every time I take a shower.
So like,
I'm comfortable with eating
and peeling my footskin.
But with your footskin,
I don't know where those dogs have been.
So I don't think I want to eat that.
You know?
Is the rat plush the reason for the rat suit?
No?
I just thought the suit was funny.
I just thought it was a funny suit.
Lemon ginger tea is your friend?
I did drink tea.
It's not really helping.
Can you describe your creative process
for your videos and streams?
Videos?
The years upon years upon years
of,
content.
I've,
I've,
what do I even call it?
Consumed.
That's where I get my inspiration from.
Literally, I've copied like,
I've copied like direct voice lines,
voice lines.
I've copied direct lines
from like other,
corn.
Yeah,
so there, there,
that's where I get it from.
Strani said,
you're cool, get in.
Yeah, I,
oh yeah,
because I told someone
to kill themselves in my YouTube chat.
That was it.
Um,
I don't remember doing that to be honest.
I have,
I have done the pin of shame before,
where if someone leaves a,
a hate comment,
I'll pin the comment and,
and uh,
maybe I'll say something mean,
but I've,
but it's mostly so other people bully them.
So yeah.
Have you watched, dude,
that's wholesome before joining feel or,
a little bit, yeah,
yeah, a little bit.
A little bit.
I'm sorry,
I'm just looking for those concrete slappers.
What do you enjoy most about engaging
with your community?
I don't know.
I feel like,
I don't know.
It's just fun.
It's just fun to,
to, to do.
Like,
I don't really,
this is so fucking depressing.
Oh my God.
So,
um,
I don't really have like real life friends unfortunately.
I'm really,
really bad at like,
keeping up with people in real life.
So all the friends I used to have,
I,
I'm such a terrible person.
I can't keep up with them.
So like,
you guys are like the ones I hang out with.
God, that's so depressing.
I'm sorry.
Do you like us?
No.
Say ah.
I hate you.
You're trash.
I don't think that's based.
I don't like when people say kill to other,
kill yourself to other people,
but I get it's not serious.
Yeah, it's not serious.
But also like,
if you're gonna leave hate,
you should probably expect to get,
to get hate back,
you know?
Um,
so,
I wasn't really thinking when I,
when I did that,
but it's,
it's like, you know,
if you're gonna dish it out,
get ready for it to come right back to you.
Sonic Generations or any Sonic game.
Yeah, I'm not a gamer.
I've played like,
do you guys know Friv,
Friv.com?
It's like a really, really old browser,
does it still exist?
Let me look it up.
It's like, okay,
maybe it's not that old,
but it's old to me.
It's like a browser game website.
And that's the only place I've played.
It still exists,
but it looks shitty now.
That's not how it used to look like.
Yeah, it's just a website
where you play browser games.
And that's the only place
I've played any sort of Sonic game.
And I don't know if that's,
that was like real Sonic or anything.
Hag!
Not a hag!
Please!
Is people getting overly parasocial
concern you at all?
Well, as long as
you don't fucking find my house,
no.
How automatic is the automatic plushie?
I haven't tested it out yet.
I don't know.
I haven't ordered it yet.
Fortunately,
thrown takes a little while,
takes a couple days for them to
because how it works with thrown is
they don't always order it for you.
Sometimes they just give you the money
and then you have to order it yourself
and then it takes a few days
for them to actually give you the money.
Yeah, I was hoping you'd get a test run.
Even if I did get a test run,
I wouldn't talk about it here.
I went to fish after flash games were taken.
Fish? What's fish?
Is that another?
What do you mean?
Like did you go to touch grass
after flash games were taken out?
Is the plushie the same one
that she tweeted about?
Yes.
Listen, I mostly put it there as a meme.
It was mostly a meme.
I really did not expect.
I really did not expect anyone to get it
because we're VTubers.
I don't want to disappoint anyone,
but if you want to see a real life
gucci getting gutted,
we're not the place for you,
but someone got it anyway.
Thank you.
If you don't know what I'm talking about,
I should probably...
There is a plush polar bear context,
so they don't know what I'm talking about.
Polar bear context.
There is a plush polar bear
that has an extension.
It has an extension.
It has some other capabilities.
I added it to my throne
and someone very graciously purchased it.
I guess I will be doing something with it.
I know what you're talking about,
so when I followed her,
I replied to that clip I saw it too.
Okay, good, good, good, good.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The clam slam and plushy.
You guys should get together
and do a burping contest.
Honestly, I really, really want to do
an off collab one day.
I think it would be really funny.
So, sure, maybe we can do a burping contest.
Honestly, I think I'll win.
Just because...
Can the other girls burp on command?
I'm not sure.
If they can, maybe I won't win.
But if they can't,
then I'm the fucking winner.
There's no competition
because I can burp on command.
I love hearing women have fun.
How do you balance v-tubing
with other aspects of your life,
such as work or school?
I'm a loser.
I don't have a job.
Before this,
this was...
Before Vealer,
this was also my job.
So, yeah.
School, it was really, really difficult
for sure I stayed up during...
I have a really bad schedule.
I'm hoping that maybe management
can help me a little bit more
when it comes to schedule stuff.
Because...
When I was managing myself,
it was really, really bad.
I would record and then edit
and then post all in one day.
And...
I'm a really big...
Well, I used to be a really, really big perfectionist.
I'm trying...
Trying to let loose a little bit
and let the editors take care of it.
Let the script writers take care of it.
I'm trying not to be so much of a control freak.
But before, I was a huge perfectionist.
So, it would take me forever
to write scripts.
It would take me forever to...
to record.
It would take me forever to edit.
So, I would stay up a lot at night
until, like, 1, 2, 3...
Never 4 a.m.
Maybe 4 a.m.
I don't know. I would just stay up a lot. That's all.
Do you properly take care of yourself?
No.
You can take care of me.
Found you through the other Twitter account?
Ah!
That's good.
I'm glad you enjoyed that.
Mom... Mom might give you a run for your money.
Will she?
We'll see. We'll see.
Starting in Shibibirp a bit.
They do. They do.
Can you burp the ABC?
No. No.
I think I'm gonna...
I'm gonna vomit. I can't.
Any hopes, wants, or ideas for a future outfit?
A future second outfit at this stage?
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh my god. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm really excited to announce this.
I already have a rigger in mind that I've sent to Strani.
We will... I want...
I think we're playing on reaching out to him soon.
They're a really good rigger.
Oh my god, I saw their work. They're so fricking good.
So I...
What I want to do is...
I want to design a 2.0 model with you guys.
I don't really...
I don't really like...
I don't really want to do a lot of art streams,
mostly because I'm not good at art streams,
but oh my god, Zellie's here! Hi!
Hi, Zellie. Oh my god, I didn't expect you to be here.
Oh my god, I'm flustered.
Okay, yeah.
So...
What I want to do is I want to design a 2.0 with chat.
Whenever we get a quote from the rigger,
the modeler, I don't know,
I will put it on thrown.
So that way we can...
You can donate to it,
to a goal of having a 2.0 model.
It's really expensive,
but I'm going to do the art myself,
so I'm hoping that we will be able to reach the goal
and I can get another model soon,
because I'll be doing the art myself,
so maybe it won't be as expensive as a regular model,
because if you don't know a lot of artists
and a lot of riggers and a lot of, like, live 2D...
Oh, mod Zellie! Oh, fuck you, right.
Where is she?
Zellie, where'd you go? You're lost in chat.
Oh, there she is.
Ah, shit.
Ah, I can't do it in OBS with a frick.
Okay, let me open...
So, let me continue, explain.
A lot of live 2D artists and stuff
actually charge companies more,
simply for being companies.
They have, like, a corporal...
Zellie, I have to find you again.
Shit.
Oh, there she is.
Add as moderator.
Standard?
Standard, I don't know, standard.
Okay, so they actually charge companies
more than, like, a regular person,
which is understandable, because, um...
you know, companies are gonna probably make more money
off of your work than, like, a, you know, an indie person,
so, uh...
I don't think Strawny mentioned
how much the models costed.
I don't even know if I should,
but it was a lot.
It was a lot of money.
The models costed, like, more than you would expect.
Let's just say that. They costed more than you would expect.
So...
Where was I going with this?
Where the fuck was I going with this?
So, yeah, if you want us to have 2.0 models, you know, um...
you don't have to support us financially,
but just watching us is really helpful,
like, watching our streams or watching our videos
that we put out, um...
because once we get monetized, you know,
ad revenue will help us.
But yeah, models, 2K top?
Not even close, bro.
I was so surprised when I learned how much they cost.
I was really, really surprised.
I was like, oh, my God.
It was a crazy amount, okay?
For individually, it was a crazy amount.
I'm not gonna...
You could ask Strani, okay?
But anyways, because I'll be drawing the model art myself,
I think, I think, I think, I think a 2.0 should be like...
I want to say 3K,
because it's just gonna be paying for the raker.
But we'll see.
Anyways, one jazillion dollars.
I really want to design a 2.0 with you.
Yeah.
And I want to make it emo.
I want to make it emo.
I think that would be really funny.
You're doing your own work.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Did you use a model on your stream before?
Yes, of course. I was a V2 player before this.
And I made my own model before.
I can help design.
Yes, I would love that.
I made my own model.
I can rig,
but I don't really want to make my own 2.0 model
because I'm actually kind of trash at rigging.
I'm not good at it.
So that's why I would like to get someone else to do that,
but I can do the art.
What kind of emo?
Like basic emo?
Internet emo?
I don't know.
Gothic maybe?
Get free.
I already have someone in mind.
I already know who I want.
I think you'll recognize the person's work.
They're good. I've seen their stuff before.
You should do 2000's emo.
Gothic Lolita? I don't know.
Something dark and mysterious.
Is 2.0 still going to be emo?
Of course.
I can't completely change.
I'm emo now.
I can't completely change this design.
That would be so mean.
It'll still be emo, of course,
but we'll have a different hairstyle.
We'll have different...
I got you, Bish.
It'll be really cute.
Unless you mean like I'm still going to use
this model art?
No, I'm not.
I will be redrawing it entirely.
I'm not going to just replace the hair and stuff.
I would pay a go-rillion dollars for...
for emo in me.
You guys are so cute.
Some of the biggest technical challenges
you face during the transition?
Technical challenges?
Sorry, I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Technical challenge?
Sorry, I'm so bad at reading the full chat message.
Someone asked what's the biggest technical challenge
you face?
None?
I don't think there was.
The only... I don't know what you mean by technical
different software?
No?
I...
I didn't get any new equipment
from feel or I already had
all of the equipment I needed.
So,
I didn't have to learn anything new.
Some of the other girls, you know,
aren't as experienced with ASMR.
That doesn't mean they're bad at it though.
They're probably better than me.
You know?
So, yeah.
So, I didn't really have to
do anything.
The only really issue I have
is trying not to be so much of a
control freak when it comes to like,
you know, my content
because, you know, I have to give it off
to someone else.
And they will do the work
for me and I will get it back
and I can't
find their house and knock on their door
and tell them
and give them a whole giant list
of things to change because
then that's just gonna make
it take forever for every single audio
and as much as I want
to do that, that's really annoying.
So, yeah.
Thoughts on beavers?
I've never seen one in real life actually.
Scuff is usually part of every process.
The only, I mean like,
the only issue I have is my,
my fucking iPhone.
It keeps disconnecting.
And sometimes it doesn't even work at all.
That's the only issue.
And also like,
YouTube is stupid. Like, this YouTube
chat is stupid.
YouTube should fix that.
Someone sent an email right now
to YouTube CEO.
Fix it. What is your response
to the skibbity toilet allegations?
It's fake! It's fake fucking news!
Shibi made that shit up! It wasn't me!
I swear to god.
I swear to god.
Let it be known here in front of the court of law.
I didn't, I never said
shibbity toilet.
I never said shibbity toilet not even once.
I don't know where you got that from.
I never said shibbity toilet.
It was mercy. There you fucking go!
Admission of guilt.
It was mercy.
Mercy is the one that said it.
And you put it on me,
and now people are like,
what a fucking zoomer.
Shibbity toilet.
Blame mercy.
It was mercy.
YouTube street have told
that they are doing anything for streaming.
They aren't doing anything for streaming anytime soon.
Oh well, they can suck my dick. I don't know.
YouTube is not optimized for streaming.
Yeah. Which is understandable,
but also like,
lots of people stream on YouTube so optimize it.
Yeah, it was mercy.
We still got 30 minutes left.
Objection, shibi never lies.
Shibi does lie.
Or was it our manager? No, it was mercy.
YouTube is pursuing shorts?
Are they?
I don't know.
I'm kind of...
I'm biased against shorts when it comes to
like YouTube shorts.
Because when I posted shorts,
not just on this channel, but on other channels,
like the same content
that would get popular
on other platforms
never really saw any reach
when it comes to shorts.
So I might even just ask management
if like, if my shorts aren't getting views,
I might even just be like,
hey guys, can we like just
post them on other platforms
and not post them on YouTube?
Because what's the point?
You know, I feel like, I don't know,
maybe they used to push shorts
a lot in the past,
but I feel like not anymore as much.
But maybe that's just me. I've never really been
I've never really been lucky
when it comes to algorithm stuff.
I've always been like, fighting.
I've always been fighting to the nail
when it comes to algorithm stuff.
Yeah, it's wildly inconsistent.
Yeah.
7K, I know, but like,
I don't know how else to...
7K
Do I sound prissy
if I say 7K isn't that much?
Like, I feel like
I feel like other platforms
that are more
focused on shorts might have more
talking like I'm a real fucking content creator,
like I know what I'm fucking talking about.
I don't know what I'm talking about, but I feel like
they might have more potential.
I just don't have faith in like, YouTube shorts.
That's all.
Uh uh uh uh.
Many say they regret hyper-focusing on shorts.
I don't know. I also hear that
shorts um...
I also hear that shorts like
get you subscribers
but they're always like dead subscribers.
Is that true?
Girl talk right now, okay? Let's um...
What's it called?
I keep fucking forgetting words.
Okay, well I forgot the word.
But like...
Wait, what was I talking about?
Oh yeah. Yeah, shorts get views
but do they get you like subscribers? Cause I feel like
the subscribers might be dead.
Like I feel like, not saying they're bots
but I feel like it's like
the shorts viewers are just like zoomers
that actually don't really stay around for your content.
They're just there for shorts.
Is this true?
I do have...
My grandma does have Alzheimer's.
Alzheimer's doesn't run in my family.
Yeah. Asked Strani?
I don't know. I uh...
I don't know. I don't know if Strani would know.
I get more money off a 20k
video than a 2 million view
shorts. Yeah, that's true too.
You get subs but they never go up.
They never show up.
Yeah, lots of kids do this girl.
We must find the meta. We'll find it together.
I'm sorry to hear about your grandma.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
I won't trauma dump to you about my grandma.
But if I ever forget things
or words, it happens like a lot.
I forget words a lot.
A dead sub is better than no sub though.
Maybe for other people but for me
I would not prefer dead subs.
Some people shout on me for
having a tiktok stream.
They were like cringe tiktok
as if you bitches aren't watching youtube shorts
and like
and like instagram reels
and like I don't know any other kind of facebook
like it's all the same stuff.
It's all the same stuff
and plus I'm not going to be going
I'm not going to be logging on to tiktok.com
and scrolling through my 4u page together
I'm going to be curating it
and showing you my absolute favorite
short form content
and you know
if you don't like tiktok that's okay
because it's basically just a meme review.
Maximum little sister immersion
you're going to
sit with me and I'm going to make you
watch me drool on my ipad
as I scroll through my tiktok
4u page
and cough in your face
How about a girl like you show
you her funny little videos that makes you laugh
I know but I think some people saw tiktok
and they were like cringe tiktok
maybe I should have said shorts
or maybe I should have said memes
I don't know but yeah
I do scroll tiktok everyday
thank you thank you
but like I said it's all short
all short form content websites
just kind of have the same content
because people repost their stuff there
which yeah
I see in disguise what you mean I see in disguise
don't worry if the sub dies
just bring him back with your spellbook
oh I forgot to mention oh my god
okay so
shebe is into this too
me and shebe both do witchcraft
I'm sure shebe is more
experienced with it
well like me and shebe like both
genuinely do it
I think even mercy a little bit
I think even mercy a little bit
I think even mercy a little bit
I think even mercy a little bit
I think doing a witchcraft stream
would be really fun the problem is
some people may shit on me for my witchcraft
because like I don't
I don't go by any books
because to me it's like
I feel like to me it's like
not that serious
like I don't follow a lot
of witchcraft rules
because it's like
I don't want to offend any witches
and chat any witches or wizards
and chat
they're all gonna curse me
they're all gonna hex me
so yeah basically
if I do some stupid shit
during witchcraft streams it's because
I'm not like a pro
wizard
I am not truly part of the shadow
money wizard gang I am just
a fraud I guess
I would probably shit
on something you do
with love
as long as it's with love
shadow wizard here
I'm very offended
I'm sorry please please please please
please don't curse me I'm sorry I'm sorry
yeah terror stream
that would be fun that would be fun
oh my god okay hold on let me drink some water
what strategies do you use
to retain your original ASMR audience
while attracting your new viewers
as a youtuber?
none? I am very well aware
that ASMR people like
there's like this weird thing
Starry talked about it too
there's this weird thing
about like
oh god this is so chronically online
and boring and like weird
and like stupid like go touch grass
but I feel like
and Starry agreed with me
there's this weird thing where
whenever an ASMRist
starts to delve into
v-tubing they get hate for it
which is so weird
because I feel like the
I feel like the audience
is very similar so you think it's like
people would be happy
but when I did it I got hate for it
I got comments like
another one
another one
oh my god
okay
like what do you mean another one
like they're basically just streaming
as an anime girl and you've been clicking
on their thumbnails with anime girls
in the thumbnail like why are you annoyed
that they're now turning into an anime girl
like you've been watching
anime girl content
I don't get it
but
um yeah so I have
I don't have a strategy
because I won't be surprised
if I get no people from there
because the content is so different
like I will say like
I'm still planning on doing ASMR content
for sure for sure for sure for like we will have videos
I'm planning a slime girl
one for the first one I don't know if it will get removed
by you too because
slime girl is very wet but I want to do
a slime girl for the first video
um
um
yeah
so many vtubers do ASMR
yeah exactly like why is it so
what what what what
what
I want to keep you your
third D
they want to keep your third D
what does that mean
find the ASMR streamers don't get any views
when they stream non ASMR
that's true but I like ASMR
so I'm okay with streaming ASMR
it is weird I'm guessing they're worried about
that their ASMR is going to stop ASMR
all together yeah I think
they assume that but like
that's often not
the case
I mean sometimes it is
she is not my oh she
she is to be rejected in shunt
fuck this bitch
okay I keep seeing this question
a lot I don't know if it's the same person
thank you for the verb reading
um
someone keeps saying
why did what inspired you to be a vtuber
um
can I say this
I used to be a fleshtuber
I used to be a fleshtuber
yeah I used to be a fleshtuber
what inspired me to start streaming was
I had this friend that I met
and he he was like
oh
I'm a streamer and I was like dude
that's so fucking gay and boring why would you ever stream
it was a commissioner
at the time so obviously like it was a dude
that commissioned me and he was like
I'm a streamer I'm commissioning you
your art for my stream right
and I was like
that's cringe
in my head I was like that's cringe
but I was like
sure yeah yeah yeah
I'll do some art for you
for your stream
and then
when I like tuned into the stream
I was like
maybe this is kinda cool
maybe this is kinda cool
actually I kind of ate my words
I was like oh actually
actually you know
maybe maybe I can do this too
so I
did it
and I had a lot of fun with it and I was like
oh my god
this is kind of fun and I remember
my first stream
what I did was I had a laptop at the time
so I streamed on my laptop
and then I used
like my phone
as like a facecam
and then I didn't even have a microphone I used
my laptop microphone
and then I was having so much fun
with like
I think I had like one viewer maybe
so um
I was having so much fun
but then like halfway through the stream
my work called me
and it made my phone
like fall off of the stand
so my facecam fell
and I had to like answer the
the work call during stream
and I was like hello
and they were like hey Emmy can you come in
tomorrow at I don't know 3pm
and I was like
nope
I never came in
when they asked me to
but um
and then I like
stream right after that cause like
I didn't
I didn't want this stream to like
you know
continue after work called me
um
I don't think I have that
that stream
like saved but it was really cringe
and I had a lot of fun and then I continued
hold on
ok
I continued until
I
sometimes I would just use a vtuber
because I wanted to have big boobs
and so I would find like a 3d model
with really big boobs and I would
like jiggle them around
jiggle them around
it was really fun to just use one
to have big boobs
um
and then um
I saw like
prism project auditions
and I didn't even know what hollow life was
but I was like whoa
there's like companies for this shit
damn
um
Emmy voice on the serum
it was
it was funny ok it was funny
one moment oh my god
I'm sick ok I'm sick for any new people
I'm sick right now
right
so anyways
um
I saw prism project auditions
and I was like yo
this was meant for me
I've been using a vtuber model
I know how to do this
I'm totally getting it
and yeah prism project is gone now
um
unfortunately you know what it's gone
because I wasn't in there I would have saved that company
I would have gotten them so much money
they would still be here if I was in there
I thought I was in there I'm kidding
I'm kidding I'm kidding
no I probably would have gone down with them
if I had ever joined
but um
obviously I got rejected
of course with that I'd be like are you fucking kidding me
oh my god it would be so funny to show you guys my old prism project audition
it was so funny
it was so funny
it was so fucking funny
you will cringe
so hard
but um
after that I was kind of
really like
mad because I was like what
are you kidding me I got rejected
so um
I stopped streaming
all together because I was busy
but then afterwards um
one of my other friends
one of my other streamer friends
because I hadn't made streamer friends during this time was like
oh
you should you can draw anime
so maybe you should try drawing
vtuber models because you can make
money off of that
and at first I was like
that looks complicated right
um
at first I was like oh that looks complicated
I don't know and then I tried it once
and learned and I was like
it's kind of easy
it's not as hard as it looks
um
and so that's when I
learned how to make vtuber models and I was like
well I'm here now
so let me make a model for myself too
and uh
now we're here
that was a long ass story
do show
I don't let me see if I can even
find it
what's really crazy was
um
not crazy but cringe
it might not be on this computer
it might be on my old laptop
I'll try to look for it on this computer
but I'm not sure if it's here
um
during that time
the only thing I knew about vtubers was like
what I had seen from prison project
and I was like oh they like cute girls
they want to hear a cute voice
um
what is this
oh I just found my script for my audition
aw
bro
so what I did was
at first I was like okay let me try to be a cute girl
right
but I couldn't make the voice
and that's why it's really cringe
I couldn't do it I couldn't it was
I was really bad at voice acting so instead I was like
okay
let me be a MILF
let me voice act as a MILF
because they had some
some mommy type models so I was like
let me let me try that
so I roleplayed
as a 40 year old
I roleplayed
as a 40 year old
MILF
in my prison project audition
I literally said I'm 40 years old
and I have two daughters
and then I flirted
with the listener
during the whole
because their thing was like introduce yourself
in a character
so I basically flirted with
the listener as
as my audition
let me see what I found
I found the script I don't know if I can find
oh god the dog is parking
downstairs type
video
videos
I found the
modified
no
well I can't find the video
but I can read to you a bit of the script
hold on
I was like it's in dead a 40 year old
MILF
let me see
I fed
I roleplayed feeding the listener
noodles
I was like open wide
see I told you
you doubt me too much
if you keep doing this I'll just have to
give you some firsthand experience
of what I can really do
I read it in a mommy voice
that'll have to be me showing you
my big sister
oh my god fuck I didn't even realize
we're close to two hours
I gotta keep my eye on the time
cause we're gonna read a 0 after this too
but yeah that was me
that was me trying to be a MILF
for a prison project
what happens to your liberty channel now
nothing
it'll stay up but all my new content
will be here
that's it
can we see the mascot
I apologize
sure
I think I should probably post
the mascot on twitter right
wait where is the mascot
here it is
oh that's humongous
here it is here's the mascot
you can see the old mascot
in my background music video
the bgm
I just thought it was a little too menacing
and all the other girls
had like really cute mascots
and I was like
I want something cute so I drew something cute
and this is it
I mostly got inspiration from like
Pinterest photos
but yeah here's the picture of the mascot
if you wanna draw
if you wanna draw yourself
the little pin pals there you go
here I'll put it in the corner maybe
down here up here
yeah so cute
yes this is
this is different from the schedule
the schedule has the old mascot on it
did Azura start streaming yet
let me check
I think I made it
so that it automatically
raids right
so cute
can I eat it you wanna eat yourself
yourself
ok now yeah I'll stay with you until Azura starts
can you wink
ah that was kinda cute
oh my god I just cut it
I kinda just like
I blushed at myself
there you go that's me winking
I can wink now
I couldn't wink before
but now I can
what inspired you to make the leap to 18 plus content
so I actually
was gonna make
like ok
I listened to it a lot before
and I listened to it a lot before
and since I was doing
I was already doing you know
the safer work stuff
I actually planned on starting
way way earlier than I
then I ended up starting
but I kind of
just like I was
it was always in the back of my head
I was like yeah I'm gonna do it soon eventually
but I had put a goal in my head
that I thought I would never reach
when it comes to subscribers
I was like once I get 25,000 subscribers
I will
I will do
you know 18 plus a somewhere
and then I got 25,000 subscribers
like way faster than I thought I would
and I was like oh fuck I'm not ready
I didn't think I would actually get that amount hold on
wait wait wait I'm not ready
so
so you know I just made it
when I was finally ready
yeah basically I listened to it before
and I was like maybe I should do it too
um
what a sweet and innocent looking peach
um
is this stream finishing before your neighbors?
my neighbors have stopped now
I don't hear it anymore
yeah from consuming it
to making it yupp
yupp yupp yupp yupp
um
the concept for your eyes
like the eggs?
ask strawny
I didn't design the character I don't know
they're in the afterglow
they're sleeping now
shh don't wake them up
okay though
um
that was a weak performance
is it because you didn't hear it?
I heard it
honestly
I don't want to trash talk my neighbors
but I don't know how the guy downstairs gets it dude
he's like
oh my god I should probably talk about
I don't know how the guy downstairs gets any pussy
he's like
kind of annoying
and ugly
and he's kind of mean
I don't know how he gets any
and he's kind of stinky like I've seen inside his
I've seen inside his apartment
and I'm like bro
bro clean up a little
you didn't hear that from me though
start moaning louder
no
they've already heard me moaning anyways
buttons like a voodoo doll
probably yeah
yeah the eyes probably do represent
that would make sense
sorry I know I'm being quiet
my voice hurts after talking for so long
what's the thing
or item you would steal from the other girls
they're tits
so I can touch them
duh
you think I want to be flat
you think I chose this
I want boobies
I want big hunkers
so
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
so of course if I could steal
something from the other girls
I would steal their boobies
flat is justice
you ain't flat
I'm not
really you think so
well breast envy is cute
is it
ok well I'm glad you think
my suffering is cute
maybe the 2.0 will have tits
I'm kidding I'm kidding I can't
I can't I can't do that
image flat flat is ok therefore
image is ok
did you guys
there's this one image I really want to show you
but I don't know if you guys
will
there's this maybe someone can find it for me
there's this meme
of this anime girl
and she has like really flat boobs
but the meme was like oh
you know flat boobs
they're just they're just hiding
like in another dimension or something
and then you can see behind her
you can see behind her
and like there's like giant tits
coming out of the other side of her
does that make sense
I don't know
I don't know if anyone has ever seen that meme
inverted yeah I know the one
that's that's what I have
ok can someone link
that freaking meme
or at least say like where the artists
or something
inverted giant
boobs meme
no
it's like some anime
meme or something or maybe it's not
I can't find it
inverted anime boobs meme
is that it
no
apparently inverted boobs
is an actual fetish though
did you guys know about this
can I show this on youtube
can I show that
that's a real fetish
do any of you guys have this fetish
say yes and chat if you do
expose yourself
that's so weird
like dented chest
yeah it's inverted
I wonder if it bounces
do you think it bounces
when she bounces and then it like moves
through her body
no
ok well that's not what I mean
I don't have that
ok excuse me
excuse me
I apologize
for
um
struggling my way
during this debut 2.0
I hope I will be better
by tomorrow
if not I'm sorry
