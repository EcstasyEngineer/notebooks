88
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:09,080
this with me no when I was in kindergarten I used to they used to have dinosaur toys in

89
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:15,320
kindergarten and my favorite dinosaur toy was the long neck dinosaur toy and I played with it

90
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:21,800
all the time and that was the only dinosaur toy I played with and anytime you know any other kid

91
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:30,840
wanted the long neck one I wouldn't let them have it because it was my toy and then this one kid

92
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,400
wanted the long neck dinosaur toy but I didn't want to give it to him because it was my freaking

93
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,840
toy and so he didn't even want it because he wanted to play with it he just wanted it because

94
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:51,600
he knew I liked it have to you in the inventory oh okay he just wanted it because I liked it and he

95
00:17:51,600 --> 00:18:00,320
wanted to like you know take it from me and so when I told him no he was like Amy's a bully he

96
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:10,760
started teasing me and he made a whole song of it buttons are there other buttons other than E

97
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:20,600
he made a whole song with lyrics about how I was a bully and he would sing it to me oh wait press

98
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:39,240
here okay puppy oh wait you're not puppy what's your name what's his name again um I forgot his

100
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:59,280
look at me I'm right at the perfect height for him okay um then we come from there I feel like I

101
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,560
should have done I mean I guess I got a key from this room right maybe I shouldn't have made it maybe

102
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:11,680
there's nothing more to do here for the next place is there another place wait there was a door

103
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:19,960
that was locked wasn't there you have to have to fucking do this again okay I did it I'm doing so

104
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:30,680
well compared to other times how do I run okay this door I wish I was as tall as Hucky you

105
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,240
don't even need to be as tall as Hucky don't worry I'm short enough or you don't need to be as tall

106
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,880
um I'm guessing I have to put a cassette in there oh look at all the drawings on him oh

107
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:53,760
so good what is that I need to find a cassette in here don't they more bloody toys more drawings

108
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:07,320
my best friend oh my god literally me and my long neck dinosaur toy oh thank you mr. Ludwig wait is

109
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:13,920
that a reference to the actual streamer wait you didn't have to swing again there was a ramp oh yeah

110
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:21,640
you're right I could have just felt fell down if you're as tall as huggy the NBA would be the most

111
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:32,040
realistic true what does this one say for Elliott Ludwig wait I don't think it's actually the

112
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:46,080
streamer Ludwig is it it's probably a character I can't read that hey we made toys like this in

113
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,560
the first chapter okay give me the freaking cassette oh there's a note here no give me the

114
00:20:52,560 --> 00:21:02,440
give me the cassette next next give me the cassette huh I'm not the cassette fuck give me the note

115
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:28,880
help me only chance experiment 814 notes this experiment utilized a live rat rat was fed

116
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:35,480
three portions daily for two weeks at the end of the two weeks the rat was killed are you fucking

117
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,280
kidding me they knew I was playing this game they wanted to torture me into a poppy flower and

118
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:47,360
preserve preservative gel mixture one week later an electric shock was applied to the rat

119
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:55,960
still in the gel and attempt to revive it the rat remained unresponsive of course it fucking

120
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:03,000
remained unresponsive you should have been it should have been me not the rat it should

121
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:12,640
have been me just take me don't take the rat analysis I still believe in the potential of

122
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,640
the poppy flower its unusual properties lead me to believe that the proper mixture and procedure

123
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,120
could have life-altering properties the poppy flower has for a long time carried heavy symbolism

124
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:31,120
and I don't believe that's for bro this guy's got terrible grammar and I don't believe that's

125
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:41,440
for no reason perhaps something larger than a rat would yield different results yeah I don't

126
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:53,920
think so let's watch this play can I zoom in somehow I feel like I'm too sure is the product

127
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:00,880
of a great man by the name of Elliot Ludwig divorced but a family man his site will always

128
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,600
set on bringing amazing toys to amazing children around the globe Ludwig spent countless hours

129
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,800
in the factory working overtime relentlessly in an attempt to continuously innovate and surprise

130
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,800
in the 1960s an unfortunate family death had pushed Ludwig down to his lowest but with so

131
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,880
much ambition he rose back up and continued to fulfill his vision for the playtime code

132
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,080
why do they censor his face Ludwig could never be content leaving a project unfinished but

133
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,680
just how did one man come to create such an astounding empire how did he manage to stay

134
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:45,000
determined even after suffering such a tragic loss it all began in the fateful year of 19

135
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:56,280
oh I guess that's all okay okay not the streamer Ludwig can we get up here I feel

136
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:07,400
like this is someplace I should look into okay maybe not he's probably disfigured oh you think

137
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:16,160
something happened to him when does William Afton come in wrong game wrong game I'm William Afton

138
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:31,080
maybe oh wait am I supposed to go in there no I'm not right I remember watching Markiplier

139
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,600
play chapter 2 and he streamed it and he refused to look at chat to help him and he got stuck for

140
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,720
like two fucking hours in one part of the game because he's too fucking stupid to like even I

141
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,520
knew what to do and I'm really stupid and I don't want that to happen to you guys I don't want

142
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,720
you to get like super frustrated with me playing this game there's another vent

143
00:24:51,720 --> 00:25:13,200
come down oh okay thank you okay thank you oh my I hope another huggy-wuggy doesn't come and chase me

144
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:40,200
this was literally the room that he got stuck in isn't it oh careful what you wish for what

145
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,520
you mean oh you think he's actually coming I thought he's not in this chapter I'm safe hell you

00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:50,940
embarrassing someone someone sent me a marshmallow asking if I have this calculus I don't think I do

166
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:59,220
I don't think I do I've I used to be able to do math really good it's just I've always been bad with

167
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:04,660
simple numbers well I've just always been bad with numbers in general but like I'm still able to do

168
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:14,740
it I just can't like I don't know it's it's like I don't know how to explain it I'm like you like

171
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:45,180

175
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:33,340
of course we will thank you no one left behind yeah you always have a calculator in real life

176
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:39,020
that's what I'm saying I never understood why they didn't let us have like when I was in elementary

177
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:44,580
school they didn't let us have calculators during tests but then as soon as I got into high school

178
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,780
they always let us have a calculator like oh fuck they always let us have a calculator

179
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,900
and I was so confused why we weren't allowed to have them

180
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,380
grab the one from the left side

181
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:13,300
I'm like doing it wrong

182
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,300
you see the blue pipe what if you got it from an angle

183
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,780
what

184
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,460
to make sure you were able to do calculations manually I guess well I'm still not able to do it

185
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:55,860
manually what do I wrap it around like this you can work this out I really can't I was

186
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:02,100
stuck on these ones a lot in chapter in chapter one

187
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:14,420
something like that that's why you got Rick brother to help you with math yeah you're gonna

188
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:20,820
help me with math soon you'll see I'm very confused blue pipe right pull

189
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,860
blue pipe right pull

190
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,860
no I don't know what you mean by wrap it around the blue pipe I don't know how to

191
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,140
you started the correct position but got the second bar before the first freaking line

192
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:45,140
what if you get it from that first thing we'll avoid it the whole and then went to the other side

193
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,300
okay

194
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,380

that's my stream but but then this comes up what do I do now

200
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:52,020
wrap around again and go back the right walk way and go back to the right

201
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,580
okay I'm back on the right go to the middle

202
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,180
go to the side where the fence isn't

203
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:14,500
wrap the pull it is wrapped did I wrap it wrong should I wrap it like this

204
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,100

and that fog must be close oh yeah we're real close I'm the one that helped him you know make

276
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:56,580
his theory of uh his dog theory yep I was there I'm the one that inspired it his dog drilling

00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:06,420
theory what's it called give it to me mama and give it to me am I supposed to be doing this

00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:37,860
where he like he like rings a bell or something um and then feeds the dogs and then whenever he

282

00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:50,980
this

359
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:00,740
welcome to musical memory Jesus Christ the sound in this game is so

360
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:02,900
fucking badly

361
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:11,300
memory and cognitive recognition test is designed to stimulate several segments of the brain

362
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:15,300
allowing us to see how quickly and efficiently your brain works

363
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:25,380
like I put the sound so low and it's still so loud why is the sound like that is there

364
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:34,500
another sound option why does it do that memory time this isn't gonna go out

365
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:40,580
a sequence of colors will be shown and you must recreate the exact sequence using the buttons

366
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:47,940
around you uh-huh bunzo will slowly lower towards you when you complete a color pattern correctly

367
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:55,300
bunzo will rise back up when you input a pattern incorrectly bunzo will lower towards you faster

368
00:54:55,940 --> 00:55:03,860
if bunzo reaches you your test is over the test will become more difficult as it continues

369
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:11,540
with longer patterns in quicker succession that's all good luck okay

370
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:26,740
isn't it amazing mommy hasn't seen the place I've been running in years mommy can only imagine

That's no fun.

406
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:57,820
Oh, there you are.

407
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:08,820
Thank you, mommy.

408
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:13,820
Thank you.

409
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:22,820
You praised me too much, I don't deserve it.

410
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:26,820
You're too nice.

411
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,820
Okay.

412
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,820
We did good, that was really scary.

413
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:37,820
That had me really, oh, oh, oh, okay.

414
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,820
I knew you could do it.

415
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:46,820
I'm not used to this much racing, oh my god.

416
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:48,820
This way?

417
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:53,820
Let me in!

418
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:57,820
I expected you to fail, are you serious?

419
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:05,820
No, actually, never mind, you don't praise me enough, keep praising me, come on.

420
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:07,820
I believed in you, thank you.

421
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:11,820
That's what I want to hear, expected me to fail.

422
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:13,820
I never fail.

423
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:17,820
I don't fail at anything ever.

424
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:21,820
I love you and me, I love you too.

425
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:27,820
Oh, am I just supposed to jump down?

426
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:35,820
Um, okay.

427
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:39,820
I knew you could do it.

428
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:44,820
Stop you're making me fucking laugh like a fucking mouse, it's so annoying.

429
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,820
Okay, what do I do here?

430
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:52,820
Oh, there's a long neck toy, and it's covered in wood.

431
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,820
Rejected item, orange robot toy, reasons for rejection.

432
01:01:55,820 --> 01:02:01,820
After considering both options, management has decided to go with mommy long legs as playtime-coast stretch toy concept.

433
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:04,820
I like him personally.

434
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,820
Orange robot toy.

435
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:09,820
Ah!

436
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:15,820
I'm guessing there's something, did you notice, did you all notice the scream of Bunzo's death?

437
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:23,820
No, he died?

438
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:33,820
I can't handle all these praises and compliments, it's- it's, it's- I can't- I can't focus.

439
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:36,820
Oh god, that's terrifying.

440
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:44,820
Oh! Oh, um, oh, lever.

441
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:49,820
I'm guessing I'm supposed to power something here.

442
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:54,820
What am I supposed to power?

443
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:09,820
You weren't scared during any of that last mini-game, but got spooked by random collisions on the ground.

444
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:14,820
Well, because I was, you know, I was expecting it to be scary. It was the scary part of the game.

445
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:18,820
So obviously, you know, I'm locked in.

446
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:23,820
What am I supposed to do with this?

447
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:29,820
Stop praising me and help me with the game!

448
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:34,820
Oh.

449
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:39,820
Oh, look, there's a huggy.

450
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:43,820
Get the crane to get the collectible.

451
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:50,820
The crane.

452
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:55,820
The crane. There was a crane around here. You're right, there was a crane.

453
01:03:55,820 --> 01:04:00,820
Of course it's unexpected scares that get me.

454
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:05,820
Where is, oh here, the crane. So do I power the crane?

455
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:10,820
With this hand?

456
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:15,820
Is there like a button to power? Oh, there's another rejected one.

457
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:19,820
Kick me, Paul. Nobody likes it.

458
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:24,820
Laughed out of presentation.

459
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:29,820
He's just like me. I never told you. I want to tell you this story because it's really funny.

460
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:33,820
Okay.

461
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:38,820
Raise equals awkward in me.

462
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:43,820
The claw. Pull the crane over top of large objects to pick them up.

463
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:48,820
Oh.

464
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:53,820
Oh, this one. Pick this one up.

465
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:58,820
Pick it up. Do your job.

466
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:03,820
Pick it up. Oh, I have to, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

467
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:08,820
I have to, I have to, um, the, the, the electrocute, right?

468
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:13,820
Okay, let me tell you the story.

469
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:18,820
So when I was like in seventh grade, maybe I used to play this very,

470
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:23,820
I used to play this very role-playing game. It was called, um,

471
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:29,820
it was called Feral Heart. If anyone, if, if anyone knows that game,

472
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:35,820
I'm going to be super fucking surprised. It was not a popular game, but okay, pick it up.

473
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:42,820
Pick it up. And, um, I used to role-play in that like all the time.

474
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:47,820
Give it to me now. Give it to me.

475
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:52,820
Oh, suck my, huh?

476
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:04,820
Was I supposed to move it so that it fell underneath me?

477
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:10,820
No, it was, um, it was a very role-playing game, but you could only be a wolf or a lion,

478
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:15,820
and I was usually role-playing as a wolf. You can make your own wolf or lion character.

479
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:20,820
When I, you could like customize the lion to look like a cat more,

480
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:29,820
and a lot of people did that so that way they could, so that way they could play as, um, please fall.

481
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:33,820
Okay, thank you. A lot of people did that so they could play as warrior cats,

482
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:36,820
and I played a little bit as warrior cats too.

483
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:44,820
Um, like I would make my own warrior cats, I see, and then I would role-play as one,

484
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:49,820
but that's not the point of the story. The point of the story is to tell you there was this one,

485
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:57,820
there was this one part of the map where people would do something called like the mating circle.

486
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:01,820
It doesn't, it doesn't sound like what you think it is, okay?

487
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:05,820
Oh, there's another rejected one. Hold on.

488
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:13,820
Serpup's a lot. Extremely negative reception from various focus groups.

489
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:16,820
Whoever's idea this was should feel ashamed.

490
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:26,820
So there was this one part of the map where they would do some activity, some event, I guess,

491
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:29,820
called the mating circle.

492
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:33,820
Now the mating circle, what happens in the mating circle is not a gang bang, right?

493
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:40,820
It's not a gang bang. What happens is, you know, everyone kind of gets in a circle,

494
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:50,820
and there's like, um, there's like a, um, there's like a ringleader in the middle of the circle, right?

495
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:52,820
Work!

496
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,820
What?

497
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:58,820
It's not an orgy! I know it sounds like one.

498
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:05,820
There's like a ringleader in the middle of the circle, and what they do, what they would do is they would, um...

499
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,820
Is there another sign?

500
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:18,820
A scientific?

501
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:20,820
A scientific sign.

502
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:35,820
Is they would call your name, like your username, and you would walk to the middle of the circle and sit next to them, right?

503
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:43,820
And then, basically how it worked is anyone, any other wolf that was interested in you and wanted to be your mate

504
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:55,580
be their mate in between a ladder where junk is piled and um or if like multiple people went

505
01:08:55,580 --> 01:09:00,700
into the circle with you then you could choose like which one you wanted to be your mate or you

506
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:05,500
could reject them both so the point of this story is to tell you that anytime it was my turn I would

507
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:11,980
sit in these circles for hours by the way absolute hours to wait until it was my turn to see if I

508
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:19,100
to see if I could catch a mate in this free role playing game and every single fucking time it was

509
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:28,380
my turn no one ever went into the circle to be my mate I only ever got one mate

510
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:35,340
and I don't remember how it happened I think it was just some I think it was a girl I think it was

511
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:41,740
a girl she just came up to me she was like wow she had like a male character and she was like wow

512
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:48,860
you're so you're so pretty and I was like oh is this my chance to get to get a mate finally

513
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:57,260
and then um we like role played for a little bit together and then she left me like I added her

514
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:00,860
as a friend on that account and I found her because you can have different characters on the same

515
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:07,180
account and I found her later again by accident because she never came to me or found me or talked

516
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:12,300
to me ever again I just found her by by accident and it was a girl like character and I was like oh

517
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:18,780
my god I've been fucking bamboozled I've been bamboozled I actually didn't find a mate

518
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:29,260
that's okay to me that's why you have big brother you're gonna heal my trauma from being rejected

519

well it finally happened after years of being ignored the company actually heard all my complaints

529
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:52,060
yep they listened to them very carefully I guess my words must have really inspired me to take action

530
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:59,900
because the next day I got demoted down to the great island of mr. toy

531

Welcome to Wac-a-woogie.

659
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:45,560
This advanced test is designed to assess the extent of your reactionary abilities.

660
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:49,640
A dual-palm grab pack will be provided to you for this test

661
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,120
Around you are 18

662
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:58,960
An adorable huggy look toy could appear out of any one of these holes

663
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,900

01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,240
Wait both hands no, just one right? I was inch I

668
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000

There's no none of them are out. Oh fuck. Oh, okay

670
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:38,040
Where is it?

671
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,360
Where is it? I didn't see any

672
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:44,240
Well, oh

673
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Oh, it's really hard to see oh

674
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,800
My god, that's so scary

675
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,800
Okay, they're pretty slow

676
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,720
Why is the audio quiet it's quiet for me too

677
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,720
Is

678
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:20,680
It's supposed to be this quiet probably like to make it harder, right?

679
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:29,840
Shit, I don't see any more where are they

680
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:43,400
Stop stop. Oh my god, stop, please stop. This is scary. I don't like it

681
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:52,240
Where is it? Oh my god. Oh my god. Stop. Stop

682
01:27:52,720 --> 01:28:03,120
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, there's so many

683
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:07,040
Why do I feel like I'm failing? Why do I feel like I'm doing really bad at this game?

684
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:19,760
Come on get out of my fucking holes

685
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:24,240
Oh

686
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,520
That was really scary

687
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:48,240
Wait, wait, wait, no, I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready to call again. I'm not ready. I need to take a break

688
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:54,720
Wait, maybe I should turn my sound up so I can hear them better. Was I close?

689
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,240
Was I close to being done?

690
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:03,680
You're tears are my nourishment

691
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:13,000
You're only using one hand it will be slow once the pace picks up use both hands to hit faster

692
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,560
Okay, let me

693
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,960
Let me try putting those sound up more. Maybe

694
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,880
Maybe that would help

695
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:30,000
I feel like the sounds in this game used to have strings attached to them

696
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:35,760
So they could be pulled back when they got too close to the children

697
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:41,200
Have fun

698
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,240
I

699
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,520
Should I

700
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:10,000
You can only do so much with money brightness is already up in the game is to start that's what I'm saying

701
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,240
I

702
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,920
Don't see any I don't see any should I put

703
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:43,640
Where is it it's coming from everywhere around me

704
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,240
I

705
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:12,480
Where is it I can't the sound is so confusing die

706
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:21,040
Oh

707
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:51,360
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Stop?

708
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,480
I'm crying

709
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,880
I

710
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,920
Jump off jump off that edge come over here

711
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:36,400
Wait, I want to see if putting my brightness lower might help because maybe maybe it's too light

712
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:41,760
Um, that's a bad idea

713
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:57,360
Don't cry I'm going to try to ignore this time. I just keep slowly looking around. Okay

714
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:04,560
I feel like the sound helps me see where it's coming from though

715
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,560
Oh

716
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,800
The gamma

717
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,800
That's not a thing here

718
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,080
There's no gamma is it vignette?

719
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:28,240
Don't stay in the middle if that doesn't help you

720
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,800
Okay

721
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:37,280
Camera is brightness remove bloom, okay

722
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,320
Sound can't help you it helps you

723
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,680
Sound can't help you see it helps you hear

724
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:52,240
I know but it helps it feel like I feel like it helps me tell which direction it's coming from if I can hear like

725
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,200
Which direction it is

726
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:00,240
So

727
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:30,240
So

728
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:03,200
I feel like I'm fucking hallucinating now

729
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,040
Like I feel like I'm genuinely hallucinating some of them

730
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,840
Like for real

731
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:33,120
Get away from me stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop

732
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:49,120
I don't think I'm gonna pass this one

733
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:51,120
I

734
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,560
I don't think I can pass it

735
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:11,520

Should I get into the vc with the other girls and see if anyone wants to be here with me for emotional support

738
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,960
Huh

739
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,280

Please, please, please, please, please, please, please!

749
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:48,920
Oh my God!

750
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:49,920
Oh my God!

751
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,920
Oh, you did it.

752
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:55,920
Hooray!

753
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:59,920
Mommy is so proud of you.

754
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:03,920
Here, Mommy has another hint for you.

755
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:05,920
Huh?

756
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,920
Fuck you, Mommy!

757
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:24,920
Give me, give me!

758
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:25,920
Yes!

759
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:32,920
Playtime Coltrane Access Instructions.

760
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:34,920
This information is recertified.

761
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:36,920
Playtime coins.

762
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:42,920
Icons must be sequenced in this exact order.

763
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:50,920
Thank you.

764
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:54,920
Thank you for praising me.

765
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,920
What's the rest of this stuff?

766
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:00,920
What's this for?

767
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:02,920
Did we ever use this?

768
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:04,920
This is part two.

769
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,920
Are we collecting this whole page?

770
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:08,920
Is this part one?

771
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:12,920
Mommy, one game left to play.

772
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:14,920
Sad.

773
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:19,920
Mommy was hoping you'd stay here forever.

774
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:24,920
Though, it's never too late to change your mind.

775
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,920
I don't care about you anymore.

776
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,920
I don't want to be with you anymore.

777
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:31,920
Leave me alone, Mommy.

778
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,920
You're not hot anymore.

779
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:34,920
I don't care.

780
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:35,920
I don't care what your voice sounds like.

781
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,920
I don't like it.

782
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:41,920
I wish Amy would scream at me like that.

783
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:47,920
If you frustrate me this much, I might do it.

784
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:49,920
Oh, fuck.

785
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:57,920
What do I do here?

786
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:00,920
I don't think I can jump back, can I?

787
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:04,920
Collectible here.

788
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,920
Collectible.

789
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:22,920
Look up.

790
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,920
Up there?

791
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:34,920
Do I have to go higher?

792
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:36,920
Oh.

793
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:54,920
Am I allowed to say that I'm going to KYKMSonYouTube.com?

794
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:58,920
Is that allowed?

795
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:02,920
How do I do this?

796
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:04,920
Okay.

797
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:07,920
No?

798
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:18,920
Die.

799
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:26,920
Only in Minecraft?

800
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:39,920
You'll make me sad if you say that.

801
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:43,920
Okay, I'm only going to do it in Minecraft.

802
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:56,920
Well, I guess I have to enter then.

803
01:41:58,920 --> 01:41:59,920
Move!

804
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:05,920
Can you make me proud if you say that?

805
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:07,920
Well, which one is it?

806
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:09,920
Can I say it or not?

807
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:18,920
Uh-oh.

808
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:20,920
Uh-oh, was I supposed to go down there?

809
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:21,920
Wait, no, I feel like...

810
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:22,920
Rep collectible?

811
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:23,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

812
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:27,920
Too late.

813
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:28,920
Oops.

814
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:29,920
Okay.

815
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:34,920
I never mean it.

816
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,920
No, I would never mean it.

817
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:37,920
No.

818
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:39,920
YouTube, don't worry.

819
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:40,920
I don't actually mean it.

820
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:43,920
Oh, who's that?

821
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:44,920
Oh, it's...

822
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:45,920
Is that Huggy Wuggy?

823
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:48,920
Oh, I missed you.

824
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:52,920
That's not Huggy Wuggy.

825
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:57,920
Do it.

826
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:58,920
Pull it.

827
01:42:58,920 --> 01:42:59,920
Yes.

828
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:00,920
Yes.

829
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:02,920
Oh, fuck off!

830
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:08,920
Is she nice?

831
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:11,920
Oh, she is nice.

832
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:13,920
Well, how nice of her.

833
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:16,920
Okay, hold on.

834
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:18,920
Let me put the sounds back down now.

835
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:21,920
Because now they're too loud.

836
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:22,920
Okay.

837
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:25,920
She's on our side?

838
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:27,920
That's good.

839
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:29,920
What is this?

840
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:31,920
Oh, it's so light.

841
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:39,920
I wish I had Optifine so I could zoom in like in Minecraft.

842
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:50,920
She's teasing me?

843
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:51,920
I know.

844
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:53,920
I could tell.

845
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:55,920
Uh-oh.

846
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,920
Is my arm going to get stuck there?

847
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:01,920
Okay.

848
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:05,920
Huh?

849
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:06,920
In here?

850
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:09,920
What a nice girl.

851
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:10,920
She's so nice.

852
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:13,920
She's the only one that's been nice to me this whole time.

853
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:15,920
Other than you two, I guess.

854
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,920
What am I supposed to do up here?

855
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:23,920
Galvanized square steel?

856
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:32,920
Drop.

857
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:37,920
Do I just go up here?

858
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:40,920
No.

859
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:49,920
So don't blame me if you don't wish to take the route if you know what I mean.

860
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:51,920
Um.

861
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:55,920
I don't know.

862
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:56,920
Should I?

863
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:57,920
Should I try?

864
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:58,920
Should I try?

865
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:04,920
What am I doing wrong?

866
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:07,920
Oh.

867
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:10,920
Oh, okay.

868
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,920
Was I supposed to take that with me?

869
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:17,920
Oh!

870
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:18,920
Yee!

871
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:20,920
I'm so surprised I didn't even need help for that one.

872
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,920
Okay.

873
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:24,920
And then I guess we just keep doing that, right?

874
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:25,920
Come closer.

875
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:31,920
You have to cross all the steel doors fast.

876
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:33,920
Got it, got it, got it.

877
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:36,920
Where do I get the...

878
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:38,920
Wait.

879
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:40,920
Wait.

880
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,920
Oh, do I just get it from the same place?

881
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:46,920
Okay.

882
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:47,920
Okay.

883
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:49,920
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

884
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:51,920
Give it back!

885
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:52,920
No!

886
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:54,920
Give it back!

887
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:55,920
Wait.

888
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:57,920
Okay.

889
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:01,920
Okay.

890
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:03,920
Okay.

891
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:05,920
Okay.

892
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:10,920
Hello, sisters of genius.

893
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:15,920
Oh, I can just push it.

894
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:17,920
I am a genius.

895
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:18,920
I'm so smart for making it...

896
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:20,920
Heart corridor.

897
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:22,920
I'm so smart for making it all the way here.

898
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:24,920
All by myself with no help at all.

899
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:26,920
Okay.

900
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:34,920
Is that Jacksepticeye?

901
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:36,920
Is that Jacksepticeye?

902
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:37,920
Is that Jacksepticeye?

903
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:38,920
Is that Jacksepticeye?

904
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:40,920
Oh, not at all, sir.

905
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:42,920
That's what I'd like to hear.

906
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:44,920
So, Marcus,

907
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:45,920
what happened?

908
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:47,920
You see,

909
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:49,920
I was in home for the day,

910
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:50,920
when my grandparents realized

911
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:52,920
that if we bloody wallowed in the cafeteria again...

912
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:54,920
His accent is so funny.

913
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,920
And that's when I see it.

914
01:46:58,920 --> 01:46:59,920
Jacksepticeye.

915
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:00,920
Jacksepticeye.

916
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:02,920
So, what did you do?

917
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:03,920
Where is that from again?

918
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:04,920
I forgot.

919
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:05,920
When I just thought I'd nab the bloody york

920
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:06,920
and be on me merry way.

921
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:08,920
Double the mornin', do ya?

922
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:09,920
Well, laddies.

923
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:10,920
I'm reaching for the thing.

924
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:13,920
And the mob handled Jolton at all.

925
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:15,920
Had me scared stiff.

926
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:17,920
I thought I was the only one there.

927
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:18,920
So,

928
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:20,920
I took a peek beneath the gate,

929
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:22,920
and some massive bloody thing

930
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:24,920
was duthering about the bloody hallway.

931
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:26,920
Thing?

932
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:28,920
You're sure it wasn't a person?

933
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:29,920
Clearly, and we can skip school

934
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,920
and take care of her 3k birthday.

935
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:35,920
Of course, yeah.

936
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:36,920
I don't need school anymore.

937
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:38,920
I'm obviously smart enough

938
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:40,920
to just graduate right now.

939
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:41,920
I haven't a bloody nausea murder-wise,

940
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:42,920
but I wasn't human.

941
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:45,920
It wasn't human.

942
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:48,920
Besides me, obviously.

943
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:50,920
Is it bad that I can't tell the difference

944
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:52,920
between a Scottish and an Irish accent?

945
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:55,920
I didn't know that Strowney was Scottish.

946
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:57,920
Had a Scottish accent.

947
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,920
I thought she had an Irish one,

948
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:01,920
because they sound the same to me.

949
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:04,920
Don't tell her I said that.

950
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,920
Poor Jacks, but they see.

951
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:21,920
Is that it?

952
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:25,920
Oh, how am I supposed to get there?

953
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:32,920
I can't tell between Strowney and fruit,

954
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:33,920
and one is from Scotland,

955
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,920
and the other is from North England.

956
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:37,920
I feel like I'd be able to tell

957
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:38,920
between Strowney and fruit.

958
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:39,920
That's easy.

959
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:45,920
No, don't tell Strowney I thought she had an Irish.

960
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:48,920
Don't tell her I said that.

961
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:50,920
Do I?

962
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:54,920
I have no...

963
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:00,920
Get one charge.

964
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:02,920
Open gate.

965
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:03,920
Get other charge.

966
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:04,920
Place it at the end.

967
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:05,920
Grab the other charge.

968
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:11,920
Okay, you're putting too much trust in me there.

969
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:15,920
Where is the charge?

970
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:17,920
Charge?

971
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:19,920
What did that do?

972
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:23,920
What did that do?

973
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:24,920
What did that do?

974
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:25,920
What did that do?

975
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:26,920
What did it do?

976
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:27,920
What did that do?

977
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:32,920
Do I need to get all of them?

978
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:35,920
But it won't last long enough.

979
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:41,920
Just don't tell her you thought she was English.

980
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:43,920
No, I knew she was in British,

981
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:44,920
like British, British, like,

982
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:46,920
like, like, hello, mate.

983
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:50,920
Good luck.

984
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:58,920
This one?

985
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:08,920
Let's fucking go.

986
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:10,920
I didn't think I'd be able to do that.

987
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:12,920
I was so confused when you said it in chat.

988
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:14,920
I was like, what the fuck do you mean

989
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:16,920
get one charge and get the other charge?

990
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:18,920
How many charges are we catching here?

991
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:22,920
We're gonna get so many charges we'll end up in jail.

992
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:23,920
Okay, go.

993
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:25,920
Go, break it.

994
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:26,920
Break it for me.

995
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:27,920
Yeah.

996
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:31,920
Say bye to Barry now?

997
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:33,920
Do you mean Jacksepticeye?

998
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:35,920
I can't say Jacksepticeye.

999
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:38,920
No.

1000
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:43,920
Well, it was a sacrifice I am willing to make.

1001
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:44,920
Oh, okay.

1002
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:45,920
Wait a minute.

1003
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:47,920
Wait a minute.

1004
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:48,920
I recognize this place.

1005
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:52,920
Isn't mommy gonna come up from there?

1006
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:54,920
No, maybe not.

1007
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:55,920
Okay, never.

1008
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:57,920
I just recognize it because we've been in here before.

1009
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:58,920
Okay.

1010
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:01,920
We did it.

1011
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:02,920
Did we do it?

1012
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:07,920
Oh, the card's name is Barry.

1013
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:09,920
Oh, Barry the card.

1014
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:11,920
Oh, Barry the card.

1015
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:13,920
Oh, Barry the card.

1016
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:14,920
Oh.

1017
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:20,920
That was whack-a-wacky.

1018
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:22,920
Oh, I did it.

1019
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:25,920
I fucking did it.

1020
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:43,920
I hope you had a fun day at the game station.

1021
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,920
No, I didn't.

1022
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:53,920
I'll start you the last one.

1023
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:55,920
Thank you for all the pets.

1024
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:57,920
All the pets.

1025
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:59,920
Did you know that pet in French means fart?

1026
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:02,920
Which way do I pull it?

1027
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:04,920
Which way does it go?

1028
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:07,920
Open.

1029
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:15,920
Go to the middle of the train station.

1030
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:20,920
The train station.

1031
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:24,920
And look up.

1032
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:28,920
This?

1033
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:30,920
Oh, yippee.

1034
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:32,920
Yay, thank you for the collectible.

1035
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:34,920
Okay, now how do I open this?

1036
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:44,920
Why is it beeping?

1037
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:49,920
What a funny language.

1038
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,920
So when you sharded, you petted yourself?

1039
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:52,920
No.

1040
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:53,920
Sharded out?

1041
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:55,920
Is there a word for sharded in French?

1042
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:57,920
We didn't learn that in class.

1043
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:59,920
They didn't teach us, like,

1044
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:01,920
I think someone asked for like,

1045
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:03,920
18 plus French like ASMR,

1046
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:05,920
but it's like, do you think

1047
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:07,920
they teach us how to dirty talking French?

1048
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,920
Of course, I don't know how to dirty talking French.

1049
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:16,920
I don't even know how to say cock in French.

1050
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:20,920
Close.

1051
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:21,920
Close it.

1052
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,920
Come on, we're trying to be safe.

1053
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:24,920
All the safety regulations.

1054
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:26,920
I'm going to fall off the train if I don't close it.

1055
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:29,920
Oh, wait.

1056
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,920
I don't know how to say cock in French.

1057
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:33,920
I don't know how to say cock in French.

1058
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,920
I don't know how to say cock in French.

1059
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:36,920
Oh, wait.

1060
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:43,920
Isn't that all French is?

1061
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:45,920
Just dirty talking?

1062
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:47,920
The teacher has failed me.

1063
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:53,920
Louie nerd.

1064
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,920
Won't be teacher fat, aw.

1065
01:53:58,920 --> 01:53:59,920
Bracket.

1066
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:04,920
There's many ways to say cock in French.

1067
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:06,920
Louie nerd.

1068
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:07,920
La baguette.

1069
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:10,920
Or maybe even le cock

1070
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:12,920
if you're feeling spicy.

1071
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:17,920
What about a stream learning to do it?

1072
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:20,920
Who's going to teach me?

1073
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:22,920
There's no website that teaches you how to dirty talking French.

1074
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:23,920
Is there?

1075
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,920
They're always talking dirty.

1076
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:29,920
Okay, okay, train code.

1077
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:30,920
Okay.

1078
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:32,920
This thing, that thing, that thing, that thing.

1079
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:33,920
Okay.

1080
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:34,920
Okay.

1081
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:35,920
This thing.

1082
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:44,920
Google translate?

1083
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:45,920
That sounds like a bad idea.

1084
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:46,920
Oh.

1085
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:51,920
Oh, no.

1086
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:52,920
Are you doing something wrong?

1087
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:53,920
You're not done.

1088
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:54,920
Oh.

1089
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:56,920
Collab with someone who speaks French?

1090
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:57,920
Mmm.

1091
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,920
Wait.

1092
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:02,920
I think one of the people who did a watch along with us speaks French, right?

1093
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:04,920
Is it para something?

1094
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:06,920
Is she like native French?

1095
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:10,920
Do the code.

1096
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:11,920
Do the code.

1097
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:12,920
Do the code.

1098
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:13,920
Do the code.

1099
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:14,920
Do the code.

1100
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:15,920
Do the code.

1101
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:16,920
Do the code.

1102
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:17,920
Do the code.

1103
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:18,920
Do the code.

1104
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,920
Do the code.

1105
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:23,920
It's too early for the train.

1106
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,920
Well, how do I get down here now?

1107
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:28,920
Because isn't this the next game?

1108
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:29,920
Paras...

1109
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:30,920
Is it Parasite?

1110
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:31,920
Parasite?

1111
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:35,920
Yeah, maybe we can do a collab with her and she can teach me how to speak French.

1112
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:37,920
She can teach me how to dirty talking French.

1113
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:39,920
Why won't this open?

1114
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:42,920
Stand to the right of the door and pull.

1115
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:51,920
Is it opening?

1116
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:56,920
She didn't understand you when you spoke French on stream?

1117
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:58,920
Oh, bruh, really?

1118
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:00,920
Damn.

1119
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:03,920
Well, I speak like very, um...

1120
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:09,920
I don't, like I speak very English French, like...

1121
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:12,920
The kind of French I speak is like,

1122
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:17,920
it's like the French of kids who just went to French school all their life,

1123
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:20,920
like haven't ever been to Quebec or France or anything, you know?

1124
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:21,920
Like...

1125
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:25,920
She'd be happy to do that?

1126
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:27,920
Oh my god, maybe I should reach out to her.

1127
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:32,920
Oh, okay, where does this go?

1128
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:33,920
Oh, there.

1129
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:37,920
Well, now that's distracted me.

1130
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:51,920
If Ella's Canadian French and she's real French, she won't understand it.

1131
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:52,920
Well, no, my...

1132
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:55,920
It should still be understandable, though.

1133
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:57,920
It's just not a good accent.

1134
01:56:58,920 --> 01:56:59,920
That's all.

1135
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:01,920
Like, it's still completely understandable.

1136
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:04,920
Otherwise, all of my teachers wouldn't be able to understand me,

1137
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:09,920
because I had, like, actual French teachers.

1138
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:11,920
Oh, come on.

1139
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:19,920
Down here?

1140
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:24,920
Puzzle time, y'all.

1141
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:26,920
Gotta use my brain again.

1142
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:28,920
Unfortunately.

1143
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:30,920
Now what?

1144
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:32,920
Wait, now what?

1145
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:37,920
Did I use the wrong hand?

1146
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:42,920
Think?

1147
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:44,920
Okay, I used the wrong hand.

1148
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:45,920
Okay.

1149
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:46,920
I got this.

1150
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:48,920
Okay.

1151
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:49,920
Fuck!

1152
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:09,920
I'm gonna fucking kill myself in Minecraft!

1153
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:13,920
Okay.

1154
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:17,920
Oh, okay.

1155
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:25,920
Please!

1156
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:32,920
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

1157
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:44,920
Did I do it?

1158
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:52,920
I did it, right?

1159
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:53,920
Okay.

1160
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:54,920
No.

1161
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:55,920
We're alone.

1162
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:56,920
Hm?

1163
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:57,920
Hm?

1164
01:58:57,920 --> 01:58:58,920
Hm?

1165
01:58:58,920 --> 01:58:59,920
Hm?

1166
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:00,920
Hm?

1167
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:01,920
Hm?

1168
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:02,920
Hm?

1169
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:03,920
Hm?

1170
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:04,920
Hm?

1171
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:05,920
Hm?

1172
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:06,920
Hm?

1173
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:07,920
Hm?

1174
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:08,920
Hm?

1175
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:09,920
Hm?

1176
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:10,920
Hm?

1177
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:11,920
Hm?

1178
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:13,920
Hm?

1179
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,920
Mm-mm.

1180
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:17,420
Oh my god, I'm playing-

1181
01:59:17,420 --> 01:59:18,420
Ah!

1182
01:59:18,420 --> 01:59:18,920
Ah!

1183
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:19,920
Ah!

1184
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:20,920
Ah!

1185
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:21,920
Ah!

1186
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:22,920
Ah!

1187
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:23,920
Ah!

1188
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:24,920
Ahh!

1189
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:25,920
Ah!

1190
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:26,920
Ahh!

1191
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:27,920
Ahh!

1192
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:28,920
Ahh!

1193
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:29,920
Welcome to Statues.

1194
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:30,920
Hi.

1195
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:32,920
This advanced obstacle course is designed to test your physical endurance and strength.

1196
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:34,920
The rules are simple.

1197
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:36,920
The lights will turn off.

1198
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:40,920
You can move through the obstacle course at this time.

1199
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:47,880
However, when the lights turn on, you can look around but cannot move.

1200
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:52,240
You may move again once the lights turn back off.

1201
01:59:52,240 --> 01:59:55,640
The lovable PJ Pugga-pillar will follow you.

1202
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:58,960
If PJ reaches you, your test is over.

1203
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:02,960
Oh my god, wait, no, no, no, no, no.

1204
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:04,960
Good luck.

1205
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:09,960
Wait, I'm not ready, I'm not ready.

1206
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Come on, I need to take a break.

1207
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
I need to take a quick break.

1208
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
I need to take a break.

1209
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
I'm gonna go refill my water.

1210
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
I'm gonna go pee.

1211
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
I'll be right back, okay?

1212
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Oh my god.

1213
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:42,000
You

1214
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:12,000
You

1215
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:42,000
You

1216
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:12,000
You

1217
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:42,000
You

1218
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:12,000
You

1219
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
You

1220
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Okay, I'm back.

1221
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:08,000
You didn't hear me, shut up.

1222
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:11,040
You didn't hear me, you didn't hear anything.

1223
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:19,040
How was the piss? It was okay.

1224
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:21,040
It was a normal piss.

1225
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:23,040
I didn't look at the color.

1226
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:27,040
Surprisingly, I actually didn't, um, bleed at all.

1227
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:30,040
I didn't goo at all while I was scared.

1228
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:32,040
That's really surprising.

1229
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:40,080
Usually I do, especially when I sneeze.

1230
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:42,080
What did she say?

1231
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:49,080
I can't hear you, bitch, speak up.

1232
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:04,080
Huh?

1233
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:18,080
I didn't hear anything she said.

1234
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:20,080
Oops.

1235
02:05:24,080 --> 02:05:26,080
Okay, now the sound is completely off.

1236
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:28,080
What just happened?

1237
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:30,080
Okay, there we go.

1238
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:32,120
Got it.

1239
02:05:32,120 --> 02:05:34,120
What the f-

1240
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:36,120
Wait, wait, wait.

1241
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:38,120
How was it already?

1242
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:40,120
What happened?

1243
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:42,120
Do you bleed when you sneeze?

1244
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:44,120
I do, I do, I do.

1245
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:53,120
When the lights turn on, you have to stop.

1246
02:05:53,120 --> 02:05:55,120
You can't move during lights on.

1247
02:05:55,120 --> 02:05:57,120
Did you forget the rules?

1248
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:03,080
Okay, okay.

1249
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:05,080
You don't move in the light.

1250
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:07,080
Okay, okay, okay.

1251
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:15,080
Oh my god, please hold my hand, I'm scared.

1252
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:24,080
Hold my sweaty fucking hand.

1253
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:30,080
Oh, come on.

1254
02:06:32,080 --> 02:06:34,080
What are those circles?

1255
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:36,080
Should I have grabbed the circles?

1256
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:38,080
Should I have grabbed the circles?

1257
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:40,080
Tell me right now, tell me right now.

1258
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:42,080
Please tell me right now, should I grab them?

1259
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:44,080
Do I grab them or do I do-

1260
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:48,080
Are they for him?

1261
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:51,080
Yes?

1262
02:06:54,080 --> 02:06:56,080
Shit, shit, what?

1263
02:06:56,080 --> 02:06:58,080
No, no, no, yes, no.

1264
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:12,080
I can't see, I can't see.

1265
02:07:18,080 --> 02:07:20,080
How do I run? How do I run?

1266
02:07:20,080 --> 02:07:22,080
Which one is it? Which one is it?

1267
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:25,080
I forgot, I forgot which button, I forgot which button.

1268
02:07:26,080 --> 02:07:28,080
Not the hard tube? What do you mean?

1269
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:30,080
Stop pressing F, what the fuck is that?

1270
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:33,080
You're scaring me right now.

1271
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:38,080
Which direction do I go?

1272
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:43,080
Stop, stop saying it's over, stop.

1273
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:51,080
Go to the right when you get out of the tube?

1274
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:55,080
Wait, I don't get it.

1275
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:06,080
Choose hard path, shut up about hard path.

1276
02:08:06,080 --> 02:08:09,080
You gotta tell me where I have to go, otherwise I don't know.

1277
02:08:16,080 --> 02:08:18,080
I know it moves when the lights are on.

1278
02:08:19,080 --> 02:08:22,080
Should I have gone in a different direction?

1279
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:27,080
Should I go like this?

1280
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:33,080
What did I do wrong?

1281
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:35,080
What did I do wrong that time?

1282
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:44,080
Tubes after the slide have difficulties above them.

1283
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:48,080
Go to your left in the tubes.

1284
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:52,080
I did not fucking move.

1285
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:57,080
Those hoops are optional?

1286
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:02,080
I stopped talking when the lights are on.

1287
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:06,080
Okay, hold on, I need to pause to reach out.

1288
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:17,080
You let go of the bar so it counts as you're moving.

1289
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:20,080
Oh, so I should hold on to the bars.

1290
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:23,080
You don't have to hang on the hoops.

1291
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:25,080
The pugga pillar is chasing after you.

1292
02:09:25,080 --> 02:09:27,080
I know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1293
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:29,080
When the lights are on, yeah.

1294
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:36,080
But aren't the hoops faster?

1295
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:40,080
So, Amy, what you need to do is run faster than the monster.

1296
02:09:40,080 --> 02:09:42,080
Okay, thanks.

1297
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:08,080
Go!

1298
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:12,080
Oh, fuck!

1299
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:14,080
Okay, okay, okay.

1300
02:10:14,080 --> 02:10:16,080
Come on!

1301
02:10:24,080 --> 02:10:26,080
I can't do this.

1302
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:28,080
I can't do this.

1303
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:30,080
I can't do this.

1304
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:32,080
I can't do this.

1305
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:34,080
I can't do this.

1306
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:37,080
I can't take it.

1307
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:38,080
I can't take it.

1308
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:40,080
Usually I love being told I can take it,

1309
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:42,080
but this time I can't fucking take it.

1310
02:10:44,080 --> 02:10:46,080
You moved during lights on?

1311
02:10:46,080 --> 02:10:51,080
I'm trying so hard not to do that, but I...

1312
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:56,080
I lost eye!

1313
02:10:58,080 --> 02:11:00,080
God damn it.

1314
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:07,080
Where's the easy tube?

1315
02:11:07,080 --> 02:11:09,080
I will see it.

1316
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:15,080
Where's the easy tube?

1317
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:17,080
Oh, it's on the left?

1318
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:29,080
Go!

1319
02:11:31,080 --> 02:11:33,080
There's the easy one.

1320
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:37,080
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1321
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:39,080
I can't see.

1322
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:52,080
Have you played red like green light?

1323
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:56,080
You're treating me like I'm actually delusional,

1324
02:11:56,080 --> 02:11:58,080
like I'm actually stupid.

1325
02:11:59,080 --> 02:12:02,080
Like I have negative IQ.

1326
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:08,080
Oh, shut up, she fell for the easy path.

1327
02:12:11,080 --> 02:12:13,080
Go right?

1328
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:16,080
What do you mean go right?

1329
02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:25,080
What do you mean go right?

1330
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:37,080
The blinking window.

1331
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:40,080
What about it, what about it? What do I do there?

1332
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:43,080
What do I do with the blinking one, hold onto that?

1333
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:53,080
Ahh!

1334
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:55,080
Go, go, go, go.

1335
02:12:58,080 --> 02:13:01,080
Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, what do I do here?

1336
02:13:01,080 --> 02:13:03,080
What do I do here, what do I do here?

1337
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:04,080
Help me!

1338
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:09,080
What do I do? Is it gonna curl up? Is it gonna curl up? Is it gonna curl up?

1339
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:12,080
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!

1340
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:16,080
You're safe? Which hole? There's no hole!

1341
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:21,080
There's no hole. Oh, there's a hole! Get me in the hole!

1342
02:13:27,080 --> 02:13:30,080
Oh? Oh, okay.

1343
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:39,080
Bitch, she talks so, so low. Is it music or sounds? I can't hear you, girl.

1344
02:13:47,080 --> 02:13:49,080
It's still chasing me.

1345
02:13:51,080 --> 02:13:53,080
Did I just fucking die of fall damage?

1346
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:06,080
I thought I had to do all of that all over again. I got so scared.

1347
02:14:25,080 --> 02:14:26,080
What do I do here?

1348
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:39,080
Mommy, mommy, mommy, shut up. Oh my god. I'm so tired of hearing mommy.

1349
02:14:39,080 --> 02:14:42,080
I never want to hear the word mommy ever again.

1350
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:44,080
How do I get out of here?

1351
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:55,080
Look up at the end of the- yeah. Have you tried looking up?

1352
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:00,080
What?

1353
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:04,080
I like how crazy her voice gets, though. I really like this voice.

1354
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:14,080
Keep needing to put her like louder. She's so fucking quiet.

1355
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:16,080
Where are you?

1356
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:30,080
Up again?

1357
02:15:32,080 --> 02:15:33,080
Oh my god.

1358
02:15:38,080 --> 02:15:41,080
Okay, okay. I'm guessing I have to look up another time, too.

1359
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:45,080
Oh, maybe go down here.

1360
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:50,080
Look up simulator.

1361
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:57,080
Look up stupid.

1362
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:08,080
I am authorized. I am authorized.

1363
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:15,080
She's about to turn.

1364
02:16:17,080 --> 02:16:19,080
Is my little sis winning? Fuck yeah, she is.

1365
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:22,080
I'm winning so hard right now.

1366
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:24,080
Right? Right?

1367
02:16:25,080 --> 02:16:27,080
Tell me I'm winning. Tell me I'm doing a really good job.

1368
02:16:28,080 --> 02:16:30,080
Do I turn this? No, okay.

1369
02:16:31,080 --> 02:16:32,080
Okay, now it's too loud.

1370
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:35,080
Wait.

1371
02:16:37,080 --> 02:16:39,080
Oh, another cassette.

1372
02:16:39,080 --> 02:16:41,080
You know, some people think I'm really old.

1373
02:16:41,080 --> 02:16:43,080
I'm really old, no, no one fucking thinks I'm really old.

1374
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:46,080
Some people think I'm really young, but I was actually...

1375
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:53,080
I was actually listening and watching cassettes when I was younger.

1376
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:54,080
A lot.

1377
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:59,080
I had a whole cassette player and I had a whole collection of cassettes,

1378
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:01,080
and I would watch cassettes.

1379
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:03,080
I'm not that young.

1380
02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:06,080
You're doing a really good job.

1381
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:12,080
I'm actually secretly a boomer, and no one will ever know.

1382
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:18,080
Hag! No, no, I didn't tell you that so you couldn't call me a hag.

1383
02:17:19,080 --> 02:17:20,080
Give it to me.

1384
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:24,080
Rotate top degree. Oh, wait.

1385
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:26,080
What?

1386
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:30,080
Oh.

1387
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:37,080
There's a tape. Where is the tape?

1388
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:41,080
Did I miss it? Probably. Is there somebody here?

1389
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:46,080
200-year-old.

1390
02:17:51,080 --> 02:17:53,080
Oh, wait, no, where's the tape? Yeah.

1391
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:59,080
There's nothing back here.

1392
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:01,080
Oh, that's where we came from.

1393
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:08,080
Literally legal.

1394
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:17,080
How could you miss? It was three feet in front of you.

1395
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:19,080
What was in front of me?

1396
02:18:20,080 --> 02:18:21,080
The tape?

1397
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:25,080
There's no tape.

1398
02:18:26,080 --> 02:18:27,080
It was right...

1399
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:30,080
Where? Here?

1400
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:32,080
Oh!

1401
02:18:33,080 --> 02:18:34,080
Can I jump?

1402
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:37,080
Oh, no.

1403
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:42,080
Yeah, I was too distracted thinking about hags and how sexy...

1404
02:18:44,080 --> 02:18:47,080
Oh, okay. I was trying to read it upside down.

1405
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,080
Okay.

1406
02:18:56,080 --> 02:18:57,080
I see.

1407
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:00,080
No, no, no.

1408
02:19:01,080 --> 02:19:02,080
Wait, no.

1409
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:04,080
Wait, there's a top and a bottom?

1410
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:07,080
This one.

1411
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:09,080
No! Oh, that's the top.

1412
02:19:09,080 --> 02:19:11,080
Can I go the other direction?

1413
02:19:11,080 --> 02:19:13,080
Can I go the other direction?

1414
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:15,080
Maybe like that?

1415
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:19,080
Wait, what?

1416
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:21,080
I don't get it!

1417
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:39,080
No matter how old you are for me, you're eternally 19?

1418
02:19:39,080 --> 02:19:41,080
Why 19? That's such a random age.

1419
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:49,080
Toy scanner.

1420
02:19:49,080 --> 02:19:50,080
Scan this toy.

1421
02:19:52,080 --> 02:19:54,080
Scan my dick.

1422
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:56,080
I'm guessing I can't jump.

1423
02:19:59,080 --> 02:20:01,080
Can I? Should I try again?

1424
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:03,080
19?

1425
02:20:03,080 --> 02:20:04,080
Haggler!

1426
02:20:05,080 --> 02:20:07,080
Watch out, we got an old lady over here.

1427
02:20:07,080 --> 02:20:10,080
She might trip and fall and hurt her back at 19 years old.

1428
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:20,080
Can I grab it with my hands?

1429
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:23,080
Sometimes...

1430
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:25,080
Wait, so if I only rotate the top,

1431
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:28,080
the bottom doesn't rotate, right?

1432
02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:30,080
Is that it?

1433
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:32,080
But if I rotate the bottom,

1434
02:20:33,080 --> 02:20:35,080
then they both rotate, right?

1435
02:20:38,080 --> 02:20:39,080
Right?

1436
02:20:54,080 --> 02:20:56,080
Oh fuck you!

1437
02:20:57,080 --> 02:20:59,080
These bitches know what they're doing.

1438
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:02,080
Wait, oh, oh wait.

1439
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:04,080
Wait, wait, what?

1440
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:07,080
No, I don't think I... I don't...

1441
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:08,080
I don't think I got it.

1442
02:21:10,080 --> 02:21:11,080
So I need...

1443
02:21:19,080 --> 02:21:20,080
What?

1444
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:23,080
Oh.

1445
02:21:27,080 --> 02:21:29,080
This fucking game is playing with my head.

1446
02:21:29,080 --> 02:21:31,080
But how am I supposed to get to it?

1447
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:38,080
How am I supposed to get to it?

1448
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:49,080
This is your first time seeing someone get stuck.

1449
02:21:50,080 --> 02:21:53,080
We'll be taking a lot of each other's first times.

1450
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:55,080
Just keep trying.

1451
02:21:57,080 --> 02:21:59,080
Run while your hand is on it?

1452
02:21:59,080 --> 02:22:00,080
What do you mean?

1453
02:22:05,080 --> 02:22:06,080
Rotate more.

1454
02:22:23,080 --> 02:22:25,080
You gotta flip it truly.

1455
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:28,080
You gotta use more specific language.

1456
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:43,080
Step one, stand on blue platform in the middle.

1457
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:47,080
Oh wait, I can't even get to it, hold on.

1458
02:22:47,080 --> 02:22:49,080
Okay, I'm in the middle.

1459
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:51,080
I'm in the middle.

1460
02:22:51,080 --> 02:22:52,080
Can I just...

1461
02:23:18,080 --> 02:23:21,080
You know what, I don't even deserve that.

1462
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:27,080
I don't deserve to see that fucking cassette.

1463
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:34,080
I'm too fucking stupid.

1464
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:36,080
Oops, am I tracking?

1465
02:23:36,080 --> 02:23:38,080
I'm too fucking stupid.

1466
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:40,080
I don't deserve to even look at it.

1467
02:23:43,080 --> 02:23:46,080
I don't know how I got this far in life.

1468
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:48,080
How haven't I died yet?

1469
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:54,080
Watch me not be able to get it anymore.

1470
02:23:56,080 --> 02:23:58,080
Oops, I think I did it.

1471
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:12,080
I'm trying to finish this fucking chapter,

1472
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:15,080
but it's really taken my soul with it.

1473
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:17,080
Play.

1474
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:20,080
This better be fucking worth it.

1475
02:24:23,080 --> 02:24:25,080
Should I know this guy?

1476
02:24:25,080 --> 02:24:27,080
Is he also like a popular gamer?

1477
02:24:45,080 --> 02:24:48,080
It's huge, I'm telling you. What's your favorite color? Blue? I bet it's blue, right? It's blue?

1478
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:49,080
It's green.

1479
02:24:50,080 --> 02:24:53,080
Okay, well, your special case, most people would say blue.

1480
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:56,080
But seriously, marketing is not as easy as you think.

1481
02:24:56,080 --> 02:24:58,080
I make it look easy.

1482
02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:03,080
If there's anything playtime coach should be known for, it's not toys, it's marketing.

1483
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:09,080
Thank you.

1484
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:14,080
Your special case?

1485
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:17,080
A special nutcase.

1486
02:25:17,080 --> 02:25:19,080
What do I do now?

1487
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:24,080
I'm guessing I go to one of the places.

1488
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:38,080
What the hell is the E sound?

1489
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:41,080
Benjamin?

1490
02:25:42,080 --> 02:25:45,080
Am I supposed to, is Benjamin like a YouTuber?

1491
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:48,080
Go to left first.

1492
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:51,080
Wait.

1493
02:25:51,080 --> 02:25:52,080
Wait.

1494
02:25:52,080 --> 02:25:54,080
Oops, wait, no.

1495
02:25:57,080 --> 02:25:59,080
Aw, fuck.

1496
02:26:01,080 --> 02:26:04,080
Now I'm going to have to figure out how to get to the left one.

1497
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:08,080
No, I wasn't listening to the video, was I supposed to? Was it telling me something important?

1498
02:26:11,080 --> 02:26:13,080
Hitting that Benjamin to blinker tint.

1499
02:26:13,080 --> 02:26:18,080
What the fuck kind of zoomer talk are you, are you saying?

1500
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:19,080
Oh!

1501
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:21,080
What?

1502
02:26:21,080 --> 02:26:22,080
Oh.

1503
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:25,080
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, but...

1504
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:26,080
Oh!

1505
02:26:26,080 --> 02:26:27,080
What?

1506
02:26:27,080 --> 02:26:28,080
Oh.

1507
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:31,080
Meow, meow, meow, meow, but...

1508
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:46,080
Wait, what?

1509
02:26:46,080 --> 02:26:47,080
Oh!

1510
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:49,080
Can you meow like her?

1511
02:26:49,080 --> 02:26:50,080
What did she say?

1512
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:52,080
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

1513
02:26:53,080 --> 02:26:54,080
Button.

1514
02:26:55,080 --> 02:26:56,080
Oh.

1515
02:27:01,080 --> 02:27:05,080
When you elevate yourself, go all the way to the top and grab the button.

1516
02:27:05,080 --> 02:27:06,080
Oh, I did it!

1517
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:17,080
Did something happen?

1518
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:20,080
Oh, this one's to go down.

1519
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:22,080
Ugh.

1520
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:23,080
Okay.

1521
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:24,080
Oh.

1522
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:26,080
Is there anything else?

1523
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:27,080
Am I missing something?

1524
02:27:27,080 --> 02:27:28,080
Should I press the other buttons?

1525
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:36,080
Aw, I think I'm doing something wrong.

1526
02:27:37,080 --> 02:27:40,080
I'll never understand why viewers urge humans to get collectibles.

1527
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:42,080
They'll never worry or care about.

1528
02:27:43,080 --> 02:27:44,080
I don't know, it's fun.

1529
02:27:45,080 --> 02:27:49,080
It's a nice challenge, even though this entire fucking game is hella challenging for me.

1530
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:50,080
Okay.

1531
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:54,080
So...

1532
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:03,080
I feel like...

1533
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:10,080
I feel like I should be sending these arrows a specific direction.

1534
02:28:10,080 --> 02:28:11,080
Can I go up here?

1535
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:14,080
You're doing it correctly?

1536
02:28:16,080 --> 02:28:18,080
Which way are they supposed to go?

1537
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:23,080
We direct the cat to a sand.

1538
02:28:35,080 --> 02:28:38,080
You should be sending them towards you.

1539
02:28:41,080 --> 02:28:42,080
Where is me?

1540
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:43,080
Where am I?

1541
02:28:43,080 --> 02:28:44,080
Which cat?

1542
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:46,080
Are those cats?

1543
02:28:47,080 --> 02:28:48,080
Those look like monkeys.

1544
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:53,080
How late is it?

1545
02:28:55,080 --> 02:28:59,080
I tell you how late it is, you're going to make fun of me for yawning.

1546
02:28:59,080 --> 02:29:00,080
Those are the bunnies.

1547
02:29:01,080 --> 02:29:02,080
There's no cats here.

1548
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:08,080
Okay.

1549
02:29:10,080 --> 02:29:11,080
Okay.

1550
02:29:12,080 --> 02:29:13,080
Okay.

1551
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:17,080
Okay, so I have to make them come towards me.

1552
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:21,080
So, if they go that direction...

1553
02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:23,080
They go there.

1554
02:29:25,080 --> 02:29:26,080
Oh, but then they fall.

1555
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:29,080
I won't, I promise.

1556
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:31,080
Thank you, promise.

1557
02:29:33,080 --> 02:29:35,080
What do you hear inside me?

1558
02:29:38,080 --> 02:29:40,080
What do you hear inside me?

1559
02:29:40,080 --> 02:29:41,080
I don't know.

1560
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:43,080
Do you want to find out?

1561
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:47,080
Go up and hit the next one.

1562
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:49,080
Push the blue button.

1563
02:29:50,080 --> 02:29:51,080
Oh, can I reset?

1564
02:30:01,080 --> 02:30:02,080
Yeah, everyone was thinking it.

1565
02:30:02,080 --> 02:30:03,080
He just said it.

1566
02:30:03,080 --> 02:30:04,080
He said it for everyone.

1567
02:30:05,080 --> 02:30:06,080
Oh, did I do it?

1568
02:30:07,080 --> 02:30:08,080
Oh, no, I didn't.

1569
02:30:11,080 --> 02:30:12,080
There we go.

1570
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:13,080
Hello.

1571
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:15,080
Now what?

1572
02:30:19,080 --> 02:30:21,080
I'm squishy and warm on the inside.

1573
02:30:25,080 --> 02:30:26,080
Okay.

1574
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:29,080
Okay.

1575
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:31,080
Okay.

1576
02:30:31,080 --> 02:30:32,080
Okay.

1577
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:39,080
Is that all I needed?

1578
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:43,080
Proof?

1579
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:49,080
Proof where it didn't happen.

1580
02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:53,080
Bring it back to the other side of the spinny platform.

1581
02:30:55,080 --> 02:30:56,080
The spinny platform.

1582
02:30:57,080 --> 02:30:58,080
Is there a spinny platform?

1583
02:30:59,080 --> 02:31:00,080
Oh, that goes up.

1584
02:31:01,080 --> 02:31:02,080
Okay.

1585
02:31:06,080 --> 02:31:07,080
Oh, there you go.

1586
02:31:13,080 --> 02:31:15,080
Oh, nobody leaves without a toy.

1587
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:21,080
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1588
02:31:21,080 --> 02:31:22,080
The toy scanner.

1589
02:31:22,080 --> 02:31:23,080
The toy scanner.

1590
02:31:23,080 --> 02:31:24,080
Okay.

1591
02:31:24,080 --> 02:31:25,080
Okay.

1592
02:31:25,080 --> 02:31:26,080
Okay.

1593
02:31:26,080 --> 02:31:27,080
Okay.

1594
02:31:27,080 --> 02:31:28,080
The toy scanner.

1595
02:31:29,080 --> 02:31:30,080
Oh, shit.

1596
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:32,080
Oh, shit.

1597
02:31:32,080 --> 02:31:33,080
Here we go again.

1598
02:31:33,080 --> 02:31:34,080
I need that one.

1599
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:44,080
I can't believe the NSFW Twitter was official.

1600
02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:45,080
What do you mean?

1601
02:31:47,080 --> 02:31:52,080
Do you not know anything about us as streamers at all?

1602
02:31:54,080 --> 02:31:55,080
I'm not as streamers.

1603
02:31:55,080 --> 02:31:56,080
I guess as a company.

1604
02:31:59,080 --> 02:32:00,080
What time is it?

1605
02:32:01,080 --> 02:32:02,080
It's 8pm.

1606
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:15,080
Yippee.

1607
02:32:23,080 --> 02:32:25,080
I've highly educated myself.

1608
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:29,080
Listen, I've had a stressful evening here.

1609
02:32:29,080 --> 02:32:31,080
Of course, I'm going to be tired.

1610
02:32:32,080 --> 02:32:33,080
Okay.

1611
02:32:38,080 --> 02:32:39,080
On the whole.

1612
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:44,080
The V-Sack.

1613
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:49,080
Wait, what?

1614
02:32:53,080 --> 02:32:54,080
Was I here before?

1615
02:32:55,080 --> 02:32:56,080
No, I guess not.

1616
02:32:59,080 --> 02:33:00,080
What?

1617
02:33:02,080 --> 02:33:05,080
Okay, I'm glad no one made fun of me for being tired at 8.

1618
02:33:11,080 --> 02:33:12,080
What do I do here?

1619
02:33:19,080 --> 02:33:20,080
This part is tricky.

1620
02:33:26,080 --> 02:33:30,080
Okay, will I go another direction then?

1621
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:33,080
I'm tired the moment I wake up.

1622
02:33:33,080 --> 02:33:34,080
Me too.

1623
02:33:34,080 --> 02:33:35,080
Me too.

1624
02:33:35,080 --> 02:33:38,080
That is very real.

1625
02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:50,080
Oh, this is a different place.

1626
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:51,080
Wait, no, it's not.

1627
02:33:51,080 --> 02:33:52,080
No, wait, yes it is.

1628
02:33:52,080 --> 02:33:53,080
Okay.

1629
02:33:56,080 --> 02:33:58,080
Wait, oh no, I need...

1630
02:33:59,080 --> 02:34:00,080
Oh, I almost fell down.

1631
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:01,080
Okay.

1632
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:09,080
Are you fucking shitting me?

1633
02:34:09,080 --> 02:34:10,080
Wait, what?

1634
02:34:12,080 --> 02:34:13,080
Hold on.

1635
02:34:13,080 --> 02:34:14,080
Oh.

1636
02:34:15,080 --> 02:34:16,080
I thought I was gonna...

1637
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:17,080
Okay.

1638
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:29,080
I had a little bit of a delay reaction.

1639
02:34:29,080 --> 02:34:30,080
Excuse me.

1640
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:33,080
Okay.

1641
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:35,080
Okay.

1642
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:40,080
Okay, okay, okay, okay, I'm gonna...

1643
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:41,080
Huh?

1644
02:34:43,080 --> 02:34:45,080
Why did you lock it?

1645
02:34:45,080 --> 02:34:46,080
What?

1646
02:34:47,080 --> 02:34:48,080
Oh.

1647
02:34:48,080 --> 02:34:50,080
Wait, no, don't use that hand, don't use that hand.

1648
02:34:50,080 --> 02:34:51,080
Okay.

1649
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:57,080
Ah.

1650
02:34:57,080 --> 02:34:58,080
What?

1651
02:34:58,080 --> 02:34:59,080
What?

1652
02:34:59,080 --> 02:35:00,080
Sorry, sorry.

1653
02:35:01,080 --> 02:35:03,080
It's still locked though.

1654
02:35:05,080 --> 02:35:08,080
In order to get the red tape,

1655
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:10,080
you need to touch the second electric pole.

1656
02:35:15,080 --> 02:35:17,080
The second electric pole.

1657
02:35:18,080 --> 02:35:19,080
Do I go back this way?

1658
02:35:19,080 --> 02:35:20,080
Okay.

1659
02:35:22,080 --> 02:35:25,080
When we can hear you smile when you talk, that's the cutest shit.

1660
02:35:27,080 --> 02:35:28,080
Can you hear me smile?

1661
02:35:28,080 --> 02:35:31,080
I think it's mostly that you can see me smile.

1662
02:35:35,080 --> 02:35:37,080
Further from the panel.

1663
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:39,080
Panel.

1664
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:40,080
What is a panel?

1665
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:42,080
There's a panel here?

1666
02:35:44,080 --> 02:35:45,080
Hello?

1667
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:47,080
Did I fuck it up?

1668
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:48,080
Hello?

1669
02:35:48,080 --> 02:35:49,080
Uh-oh.

1670
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:58,080
You can hear me smile?

1671
02:35:58,080 --> 02:35:59,080
Aww.

1672
02:36:00,080 --> 02:36:02,080
Step one, grab one.

1673
02:36:03,080 --> 02:36:04,080
I grabbed one.

1674
02:36:12,080 --> 02:36:14,080
You have to activate the other room

1675
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:16,080
and then go back with your hand still connected.

1676
02:36:18,080 --> 02:36:20,080
Touch only the further pole.

1677
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:31,080
Oops.

1678
02:36:33,080 --> 02:36:35,080
Okay, only the further pole.

1679
02:36:38,080 --> 02:36:42,080
Oh, okay.

1680
02:36:47,080 --> 02:36:48,080
Oh.

1681
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:51,080
Okay, okay.

1682
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:53,080
Oh.

1683
02:36:54,080 --> 02:36:55,080
Wait, what?

1684
02:36:55,080 --> 02:36:56,080
Hold on.

1685
02:36:56,080 --> 02:36:57,080
What just happened?

1686
02:36:57,080 --> 02:36:58,080
What?

1687
02:36:58,080 --> 02:36:59,080
Wait.

1688
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:04,080
The circle in the middle of the screen

1689
02:37:04,080 --> 02:37:05,080
indicates how far your arm...

1690
02:37:05,080 --> 02:37:06,080
Oh, there was a circle.

1691
02:37:07,080 --> 02:37:09,080
Wait, I feel like I just did nothing.

1692
02:37:09,080 --> 02:37:10,080
What did I...?

1693
02:37:11,080 --> 02:37:12,080
Wait.

1694
02:37:13,080 --> 02:37:14,080
What did I just do?

1695
02:37:15,080 --> 02:37:16,080
That was nothing.

1696
02:37:16,080 --> 02:37:17,080
Did I...

1697
02:37:19,080 --> 02:37:21,080
Your smile sounds like ara ara, what the fuck?

1698
02:37:21,080 --> 02:37:22,080
How is that...

1699
02:37:22,080 --> 02:37:23,080
What?

1700
02:37:25,080 --> 02:37:26,080
What did I...

1701
02:37:26,080 --> 02:37:27,080
What did I...

1702
02:37:27,080 --> 02:37:28,080
What did I forget?

1703
02:37:32,080 --> 02:37:33,080
Stop.

1704
02:37:33,080 --> 02:37:35,080
When you type in me like that,

1705
02:37:35,080 --> 02:37:38,080
it makes me feel like you're disappointed in me.

1706
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:42,080
Where do I go now?

1707
02:37:43,080 --> 02:37:45,080
Red door was open.

1708
02:37:45,080 --> 02:37:47,080
It was open, you're right.

1709
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:49,080
It was open.

1710
02:37:50,080 --> 02:37:51,080
What do I do with it?

1711
02:37:55,080 --> 02:37:56,080
Come on.

1712
02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:03,080
Repeat the steps.

1713
02:38:05,080 --> 02:38:07,080
You did great, just forgot to send energy

1714
02:38:07,080 --> 02:38:08,080
to the one in the wall.

1715
02:38:09,080 --> 02:38:12,080
Don't use my full government name against me.

1716
02:38:16,080 --> 02:38:17,080
Or there was...

1717
02:38:27,080 --> 02:38:28,080
Was there another one here?

1718
02:38:31,080 --> 02:38:32,080
Was there another one here?

1719
02:38:34,080 --> 02:38:35,080
Am I missing something?

1720
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:37,080
Am I missing something?

1721
02:38:39,080 --> 02:38:40,080
Stop!

1722
02:38:46,080 --> 02:38:47,080
Stop!

1723
02:38:47,080 --> 02:38:49,080
If you see channel VR,

1724
02:38:49,080 --> 02:38:53,080
grab the red tape tucked into the electrical panel.

1725
02:38:55,080 --> 02:38:57,080
The red tape tucked into the electrical panel.

1726
02:38:57,080 --> 02:38:59,080
Okay, the red tape tucked into the electrical panel.

1727
02:38:59,080 --> 02:39:00,080
Okay, okay, okay.

1728
02:39:02,080 --> 02:39:03,080
Okay, behind me?

1729
02:39:05,080 --> 02:39:07,080
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1730
02:39:07,080 --> 02:39:09,080
Wait, now I feel like I'm going the wrong direction.

1731
02:39:15,080 --> 02:39:16,080
Okay.

1732
02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:17,080
Electrical panel.

1733
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:21,080
Oh my fucking god.

1734
02:39:21,080 --> 02:39:23,080
The way they make me kill myself here?

1735
02:39:23,080 --> 02:39:24,080
It's like...

1736
02:39:25,080 --> 02:39:27,080
It's like extra punishment.

1737
02:39:27,080 --> 02:39:28,080
Okay.

1738
02:39:35,080 --> 02:39:36,080
You can die later.

1739
02:39:37,080 --> 02:39:38,080
Kill me now, please.

1740
02:39:39,080 --> 02:39:40,080
I don't want to.

1741
02:39:41,080 --> 02:39:43,080
You've tortured me enough.

1742
02:39:44,080 --> 02:39:45,080
Get your...

1743
02:39:45,080 --> 02:39:47,080
Pull yourself back up, soldier.

1744
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:51,080
Okay.

1745
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:55,080
Okay.

1746
02:39:57,080 --> 02:39:58,080
Okay.

1747
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:02,080
Oh!

1748
02:40:02,080 --> 02:40:04,080
How am I supposed to see that?

1749
02:40:06,080 --> 02:40:07,080
How is...

1750
02:40:08,080 --> 02:40:10,080
How am I supposed to see that?

1751
02:40:10,080 --> 02:40:11,080
Okay, wait.

1752
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:17,080
Oh, this one.

1753
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:24,080
Am I supposed to keep my hand there?

1754
02:40:24,080 --> 02:40:25,080
Okay.

1755
02:40:28,080 --> 02:40:30,080
Oh, that's the wrong thing there.

1756
02:40:54,080 --> 02:40:59,080
Is he talking about...

1757
02:41:09,080 --> 02:41:11,080
Is he talking about mommy?

1758
02:41:14,080 --> 02:41:15,080
I am a good girl.

1759
02:41:15,080 --> 02:41:19,080
I'm a good girl for suffering through this game with you.

1760
02:41:20,080 --> 02:41:22,080
Okay, where do I go now?

1761
02:41:24,080 --> 02:41:27,080
You can pick all the bookers with that thing.

1762
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:29,080
Yeah, he is.

1763
02:41:29,080 --> 02:41:30,080
Okay, okay.

1764
02:41:33,080 --> 02:41:34,080
Do I leave?

1765
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:41,080
That's not...

1766
02:41:46,080 --> 02:41:48,080
Spiders aren't scary, I agree.

1767
02:41:48,080 --> 02:41:49,080
I have a spider.

1768
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:51,080
Her name is Rangel,

1769
02:41:51,080 --> 02:41:53,080
and she's a tarantula.

1770
02:41:54,080 --> 02:41:56,080
And she's an Arizona blonde,

1771
02:41:56,080 --> 02:41:58,080
and she's five years old,

1772
02:41:59,080 --> 02:42:01,080
and she's really fat.

1773
02:42:02,080 --> 02:42:05,080
You gotta do it again and go through the other door.

1774
02:42:07,080 --> 02:42:08,080
The best girl?

1775
02:42:08,080 --> 02:42:10,080
Your best girl?

1776
02:42:10,080 --> 02:42:11,080
No.

1777
02:42:21,080 --> 02:42:24,080
You have to need to get through the electrical door.

1778
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:27,080
Electrical door.

1779
02:42:27,080 --> 02:42:28,080
There's another door.

1780
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:32,080
Okay, I'm gonna go here.

1781
02:42:35,080 --> 02:42:36,080
Another door.

1782
02:42:36,080 --> 02:42:37,080
This door?

1783
02:42:41,080 --> 02:42:44,080
Jumping spiders are really cute.

1784
02:42:47,080 --> 02:42:49,080
Is it this door?

1785
02:42:51,080 --> 02:42:54,080
What's the point of using both of these?

1786
02:42:55,080 --> 02:42:57,080
What if I just do one?

1787
02:43:00,080 --> 02:43:01,080
Nothing.

1788
02:43:03,080 --> 02:43:05,080
In the room with the TV.

1789
02:43:06,080 --> 02:43:08,080
The other outlet.

1790
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:12,080
The other outlet.

1791
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:28,080
Did you try to type in me,

1792
02:43:28,080 --> 02:43:31,080
and instead of correct it to I'm my?

1793
02:43:32,080 --> 02:43:34,080
Right there, the circle.

1794
02:43:35,080 --> 02:43:37,080
The circle in front of me.

1795
02:43:39,080 --> 02:43:41,080
The circle in front of me.

1796
02:43:42,080 --> 02:43:44,080
The circle, the circle in front of me.

1797
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:47,080
The circle in front of me.

1798
02:43:47,080 --> 02:43:49,080
The circle in front of me.

1799
02:43:49,080 --> 02:43:51,080
It's just that simple, the circle in front of me, right.

1800
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:54,080
Why don't I think about that circle in front of me?

1801
02:43:54,080 --> 02:43:57,080
Yeah, but yeah, I get it.

1802
02:43:58,080 --> 02:44:00,080
Yeah, the circle in front of me.

1803
02:44:02,080 --> 02:44:04,080
The circle in front of me.

1804
02:44:04,080 --> 02:44:22,760
All these squares make a circle, and I'm in the middle, and all the rest of the wolves

1805
02:44:22,760 --> 02:44:28,200
are around me, and no one wants to be my mate, and I'm getting publicly humiliated because

1806
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:35,200
no one wants to be my mate!

1807
02:44:35,200 --> 02:45:04,200
I don't need sleep, I need to finish this fucking level, that's what I need!

1808
02:45:04,200 --> 02:45:33,200
Okay, fine, jeez, let's go up left, tell me what to do now?

1809
02:45:34,200 --> 02:45:51,200
Look for the number 2 in the room with the VCR.

1810
02:45:51,200 --> 02:45:54,200
Your circle is your reticle, are you?

1811
02:45:54,200 --> 02:45:58,200
Are you shitting on my dick right now?

1812
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:05,200
Swing across, open door, swing back, connect power.

1813
02:46:05,200 --> 02:46:14,200
Swing across, you gotta connect 1 to 2.

1814
02:46:14,200 --> 02:46:20,200
Okay, what?

1815
02:46:20,200 --> 02:46:24,200
I should be in front of the...

1816
02:46:24,200 --> 02:46:28,200
When you open the door, don't take the energy out of it.

1817
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:51,200
Number 2?

1818
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:54,200
Number 2?

1819
02:46:54,200 --> 02:46:57,200
2?

1820
02:46:57,200 --> 02:47:03,200
Any 2s?

1821
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:08,200
Why won't it work?

1822
02:47:08,200 --> 02:47:12,200
Huh?

1823
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:19,200
It's right there, it's right there!

1824
02:47:19,200 --> 02:47:21,200
What's going on, what's going on?

1825
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:26,200
It's right there, it's right there, it's right there, just let me...

1826
02:47:26,200 --> 02:47:29,200
You have to swing back?

1827
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:31,200
Huh?

1828
02:47:31,200 --> 02:47:37,200
What is a reticle, what does a reticle mean?

1829
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:40,200
You have to swing back, you need the green one?

1830
02:47:40,200 --> 02:47:42,200
There's a green one?

1831
02:47:42,200 --> 02:47:48,200
Swing to the other room, then let go, then let go, left hand go through the door,

1832
02:47:48,200 --> 02:47:52,200
you will be back to the first, activate the pull, that doesn't...

1833
02:47:52,200 --> 02:47:58,200
You need green power.

1834
02:47:58,200 --> 02:48:04,200
Green power, of course!

1835
02:48:04,200 --> 02:48:08,200
Right, yeah, green power, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I need green power.

1836
02:48:08,200 --> 02:48:14,200
You gotta open the door to go through the red side to get the electricity.

1837
02:48:14,200 --> 02:48:18,200
Yeah, green power, yeah.

1838
02:48:18,200 --> 02:48:21,200
Why don't we go to sleep?

1839
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:25,200
If I pass this, do I win?

1840
02:48:25,200 --> 02:48:32,200
Like how much more is there?

1841
02:48:32,200 --> 02:48:39,200
Do I need both of these?

1842
02:48:39,200 --> 02:48:46,200
In the middle of the screen you got a little rectangle.

1843
02:48:46,200 --> 02:48:52,200
No?

1844
02:48:52,200 --> 02:48:54,200
The lid?

1845
02:48:54,200 --> 02:49:04,200
I feel like...

1846
02:49:04,200 --> 02:49:11,200
Okay wait, so do I need both of these?

1847
02:49:11,200 --> 02:49:16,200
Hold on, I have an idea, I have an idea, I have an idea, let me do something here.

1848
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:21,200
Let me do something.

1849
02:49:21,200 --> 02:49:36,200
What the fuck is this called?

1850
02:49:36,200 --> 02:49:41,200
Yeah, stand back, I'm starting to cook with gas now, okay?

1851
02:49:41,200 --> 02:49:57,200
What is this part? What should I call this part?

1852
02:49:57,200 --> 02:50:03,200
Come on, fucking ad.

1853
02:50:03,200 --> 02:50:09,200
Wait, is there such a thing as YouTube dark mode?

1854
02:50:09,200 --> 02:50:23,200
Okay, we passed that, we passed that.

1855
02:50:23,200 --> 02:50:29,200
Oh fuck, we're almost at three hours?

1856
02:50:29,200 --> 02:50:37,200
Okay, we passed that.

1857
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:43,200
YouTube has a dark mode?

1858
02:50:43,200 --> 02:50:50,200
Oh this is the room, okay.

1859
02:50:50,200 --> 02:50:55,200
I want to finish this fucking game dude.

1860
02:50:55,200 --> 02:51:03,200
I'm not about to change the dark mode right now, let me have my fucking light mode.

1861
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:08,200
I like light mode.

1862
02:51:08,200 --> 02:51:14,200
I know it's muted, I know it's muted.

1863
02:51:14,200 --> 02:51:27,200
Is he figuring it out himself currently? Does he not know how to play either?

1864
02:51:27,200 --> 02:51:33,200
Cause he looks like he doesn't know how to play either.

1865
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:38,200
Come on dude, come on, this is a walkthrough, you're supposed to know what to do already, come on man.

1866
02:51:38,200 --> 02:51:41,200
Maybe he's talking?

1867
02:51:41,200 --> 02:51:44,200
No, he's not even talking.

1868
02:51:44,200 --> 02:51:50,200
Come on man, don't waste my time here, come on.

1869
02:51:50,200 --> 02:51:54,200
Oh my god, you dumbass.

1870
02:51:54,200 --> 02:52:01,200
Wait what?

1871
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:07,200
Wait what?

1872
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:09,200
Is this guy stupid?

1873
02:52:09,200 --> 02:52:14,200
Is he being stupid on purpose?

1874
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:19,200
He's not talking.

1875
02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:23,200
Bro, this is not a walkthrough.

1876
02:52:23,200 --> 02:52:29,200
How are you going to fucking die during a walkthrough?

1877
02:52:41,200 --> 02:52:50,200
Yeah everyone's stupid except for me.

1878
02:52:50,200 --> 02:52:56,200
Come on, you can do it, come on.

1879
02:52:56,200 --> 02:53:00,200
Play it at two times speed.

1880
02:53:00,200 --> 02:53:08,200
Does he get stuck here too? Cause it looks like he's almost not...

1881
02:53:08,200 --> 02:53:11,200
Okay no, I'm not watching this, I'm not fucking watching this.

1882
02:53:11,200 --> 02:53:15,200
Give me a walkthrough.

1883
02:53:15,200 --> 02:53:31,200
Like show me that you know what you're doing.

1884
02:53:31,200 --> 02:53:39,200
Oh my fucking god.

1885
02:53:39,200 --> 02:53:42,200
This is so frustrating.

1886
02:53:42,200 --> 02:53:47,200
It's literally a pre-recorded video, cut out the parts where you fucking die.

1887
02:53:47,200 --> 02:53:50,200
Isn't that fucking hard? It's a walkthrough.

1888
02:53:50,200 --> 02:53:53,200
Walk me through the game, why are you showing me you dying?

1889
02:53:53,200 --> 02:54:07,200
Do you want me to copy that too? Do you want me to copy every time you fucking die?

1890
02:54:07,200 --> 02:54:14,200
Wait, what?

1891
02:54:14,200 --> 02:54:18,200
Wait, what just happened?

1892
02:54:18,200 --> 02:54:24,200
Let me look through that again.

1893
02:54:24,200 --> 02:54:34,200
Okay.

1894
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:40,200
Oh you have to do it really quickly and you have to get both of them.

1895
02:54:40,200 --> 02:54:49,200
It stays open.

1896
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:55,200
Okay.

1897
02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:59,200
Oh god it's lagging, why is it lagging?

1898
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:02,200
Okay.

1899
02:55:02,200 --> 02:55:05,200
Okay, hold on, let me...

1900
02:55:05,200 --> 02:55:20,200
God this game hurts to look at.

1901
02:55:20,200 --> 02:55:33,200
This developer should KYS.

1902
02:55:33,200 --> 02:55:41,200
One out, one out.

1903
02:55:41,200 --> 02:55:45,200
What do you mean gamma? Do I have something?

1904
02:55:45,200 --> 02:55:50,200
This play capture? Do I have like a filter on my...

1905
02:55:50,200 --> 02:56:01,200
Where's the gamma? What gamma are you talking about? There's no gamma.

1906
02:56:01,200 --> 02:56:07,200
The developer should kiss his sister.

1907
02:56:07,200 --> 02:56:12,200
Turn your brain around, do you hate it so much?

1908
02:56:12,200 --> 02:56:15,200
Like, huh?

1909
02:56:15,200 --> 02:56:18,200
Is that better? Is that what you want?

1910
02:56:18,200 --> 02:56:20,200
Thank you for the pet.

1911
02:56:20,200 --> 02:56:23,200
Okay, I'm as the same thing as Brainus, but I feel like this is too dark.

1912
02:56:23,200 --> 02:56:26,200
I'm really blind, man.

1913
02:56:26,200 --> 02:56:29,200
Okay.

1914
02:56:29,200 --> 02:56:35,200
Let me see what he does.

1915
02:56:35,200 --> 02:56:41,200
Where do you go? Back in here.

1916
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:50,200
Okay, okay.

1917
02:56:50,200 --> 02:56:54,200
Nothing is brighter than your smile, oh you.

1918
02:56:54,200 --> 02:56:58,200
Nothing may be bright and OBS.

1919
02:56:58,200 --> 02:57:05,200
Like my display capture doesn't have any gamma filters or anything.

1920
02:57:05,200 --> 02:57:07,200
Yeah, of course I fucking love the dislike, are you kidding me?

1921
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:10,200
What's the fucking effort into your walkthrough?

1922
02:57:10,200 --> 02:57:12,200
It's not that hard.

1923
02:57:12,200 --> 02:57:13,200
Wait, what?

1924
02:57:13,200 --> 02:57:19,200
The wrong direction?

1925
02:57:19,200 --> 02:57:24,200
If you could just watch the rest of the playthrough?

1926
02:57:24,200 --> 02:57:30,200
Okay, oh shit.

1927
02:57:30,200 --> 02:57:32,200
This is when mommy chases me.

1928
02:57:32,200 --> 02:57:35,200
Okay, if I get stuck here with mommy, I'm gonna...

1929
02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:37,200
I will end, right?

1930
02:57:38,200 --> 02:57:43,200
I asked you to play fair and you cheated.

1931
02:57:43,200 --> 02:57:44,200
Great cheaters.

1932
02:57:44,200 --> 02:57:47,200
What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

1933
02:57:47,200 --> 02:57:50,200
One last game.

1934
02:57:50,200 --> 02:57:52,200
Okay.

1935
02:57:52,200 --> 02:57:54,200
Hide and...

1936
02:57:54,200 --> 02:57:55,200
Stay.

1937
02:57:55,200 --> 02:57:57,200
Fuck.

1938
02:57:57,200 --> 02:57:58,200
Ten.

1939
02:57:58,200 --> 02:58:00,200
Nine.

1940
02:58:00,200 --> 02:58:04,200
God, the way she goes crazy is so sexy.

1941
02:58:04,200 --> 02:58:08,200
I hate her before but her voice is so hot.

1942
02:58:17,200 --> 02:58:20,200
Am I actually supposed to hide?

1943
02:58:35,200 --> 02:58:40,200
I'll just run? Okay.

1944
02:58:40,200 --> 02:58:45,200
I'll just run.

1945
02:58:45,200 --> 02:58:47,200
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

1946
02:58:47,200 --> 02:58:50,200
I feel like it's really suspiciously quiet.

1947
02:58:50,200 --> 02:58:52,200
Oh, come on now.

1948
02:58:52,200 --> 02:58:56,200
Did I go the wrong direction?

1949
02:58:56,200 --> 02:58:57,200
Okay, wait, I'm pausing.

1950
02:58:57,200 --> 02:58:58,200
What did I do wrong?

1951
02:58:58,200 --> 02:59:03,200
What did I do wrong this time?

1952
02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:11,200
Did I go the wrong direction?

1953
02:59:11,200 --> 02:59:15,200
Up?

1954
02:59:15,200 --> 02:59:18,200
Hello, you silent when I'm crazy?

1955
02:59:18,200 --> 02:59:22,200
You can go listen to me be crazy if you want.

1956
02:59:22,200 --> 02:59:24,200
There should be a handle.

1957
02:59:24,200 --> 02:59:28,200
Stop saying I'm mine.

1958
02:59:35,200 --> 02:59:38,200
Okay, look up where?

1959
02:59:38,200 --> 02:59:40,200
Look up where?

1960
02:59:40,200 --> 02:59:41,200
Where is the up?

1961
02:59:41,200 --> 02:59:45,200
Where is the up?

1962
02:59:45,200 --> 02:59:50,200
You have to pull yourself off while she passes by.

1963
02:59:59,200 --> 03:00:02,200
I feel like I'm just walking towards her now.

1964
03:00:02,200 --> 03:00:06,200
Here?

1965
03:00:06,200 --> 03:00:10,200
Wait, what? Am I?

1966
03:00:15,200 --> 03:00:18,200
I think therefore I'm mine.

1967
03:00:18,200 --> 03:00:22,200
Go back?

1968
03:00:26,200 --> 03:00:30,200
Is there some sort of timer?

1969
03:00:30,200 --> 03:00:33,200
I was doing it right the first time?

1970
03:00:33,200 --> 03:00:36,200
Oh.

1971
03:00:36,200 --> 03:00:42,200
Okay, and now she's going to chase me through this?

1972
03:00:42,200 --> 03:00:45,200
Get back to me!

1973
03:00:45,200 --> 03:00:50,200
Okay, okay.

1974
03:00:50,200 --> 03:00:57,200
I feel like I should be getting chased right now.

1975
03:00:57,200 --> 03:01:02,200
There's no urgency here.

1976
03:01:02,200 --> 03:01:08,200
Should I do all of these?

1977
03:01:08,200 --> 03:01:13,200
Put the figure in a jiffy.

1978
03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:18,200
Put the figure in a jar.

1979
03:01:25,200 --> 03:01:29,200
There's an order.

1980
03:01:29,200 --> 03:01:32,200
I'm guessing it's...

1981
03:01:32,200 --> 03:01:36,200
Red, yellow, blue, green.

1982
03:01:36,200 --> 03:01:41,200
Red, yellow, blue, green.

1983
03:01:44,200 --> 03:01:51,200
A common tactic in this game when stuck is to look up.

1984
03:01:59,200 --> 03:02:01,200
What do I do here now?

1985
03:02:01,200 --> 03:02:04,200
Wait, wasn't there a voltage thing?

1986
03:02:04,200 --> 03:02:06,200
Tab?

1987
03:02:06,200 --> 03:02:10,200
This one?

1988
03:02:10,200 --> 03:02:15,200
That's a train call.

1989
03:02:15,200 --> 03:02:17,200
Numbers?

1990
03:02:17,200 --> 03:02:20,200
Look under?

1991
03:02:22,200 --> 03:02:26,200
Numbers.

1992
03:02:26,200 --> 03:02:28,200
Numbers.

1993
03:02:28,200 --> 03:02:30,200
Numbers, what do they mean?

1994
03:02:30,200 --> 03:02:32,200
Numbers!

1995
03:02:32,200 --> 03:02:34,200
Okay, goodbye.

1996
03:02:34,200 --> 03:02:37,200
It's just the order of the numbers.

1997
03:02:37,200 --> 03:02:39,200
Numbers?

1998
03:02:39,200 --> 03:02:41,200
The wires? The numbers and the wires?

1999
03:02:41,200 --> 03:02:44,200
There's numbers and wires?

2000
03:02:44,200 --> 03:02:48,200
Numbers?

2001
03:02:48,200 --> 03:02:50,200
Pull up, check the numbers.

2002
03:02:50,200 --> 03:02:52,200
The numbers.

2003
03:02:52,200 --> 03:02:56,200
Two, one.

2004
03:02:56,200 --> 03:02:58,200
Is it one, three, two?

2005
03:02:58,200 --> 03:03:00,200
Is that the order?

2006
03:03:00,200 --> 03:03:02,200
There's numbers, yeah.

2007
03:03:02,200 --> 03:03:06,200
Look at the numbers on the boxes, yeah.

2008
03:03:06,200 --> 03:03:14,200
Let's tell you what color lover to pull.

2009
03:03:14,200 --> 03:03:22,200
So red, red, red, green, blue?

2010
03:03:22,200 --> 03:03:29,200
Red, blue, you guys are telling me different colors.

2011
03:03:29,200 --> 03:03:33,200
Red, red, blue, green.

2012
03:03:33,200 --> 03:03:36,200
Red, blue, green.

2013
03:03:36,200 --> 03:03:44,200
Red, blue, green.

2014
03:03:44,200 --> 03:03:46,200
Did I do it?

2015
03:03:46,200 --> 03:03:48,200
Wait, red, blue, green, yellow.

2016
03:03:48,200 --> 03:03:50,200
Yellow, where's yellow?

2017
03:03:50,200 --> 03:03:52,200
There's no yellow.

2018
03:03:52,200 --> 03:03:56,200
Where are you seeing yellow?

2019
03:03:56,200 --> 03:04:01,200
Fucking, stop saying I'm mine!

2020
03:04:01,200 --> 03:04:03,200
Yellow last?

2021
03:04:03,200 --> 03:04:07,200
But there's no yellow here.

2022
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:10,200
Okay, red, red, blue.

2023
03:04:10,200 --> 03:04:12,200
Oh, there is a yellow!

2024
03:04:12,200 --> 03:04:14,200
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2025
03:04:14,200 --> 03:04:21,200
Red, red, blue, green, yellow, okay.

2026
03:04:21,200 --> 03:04:28,200
Okay, red, blue, green, yellow.

2027
03:04:28,200 --> 03:04:30,200
Yay!

2028
03:04:30,200 --> 03:04:39,200
Oh my god, I love not being stuck in video games.

2029
03:04:39,200 --> 03:04:40,200
Ah!

2030
03:04:40,200 --> 03:04:41,200
Where is she?

2031
03:04:41,200 --> 03:04:42,200
Ah!

2032
03:04:42,200 --> 03:04:43,200

Ah!

2044

Ah!

03:10:33,420 --> 03:10:34,620
Hahahaha!

2088
03:10:34,620 --> 03:10:36,620
Task failed success!

2089
03:10:36,620 --> 03:10:38,620
Hahahaha!

2090
03:10:38,620 --> 03:10:40,620
Hahahaha!

2091
03:10:40,620 --> 03:10:42,620
Oh, where did she go?

2092
03:10:42,620 --> 03:10:44,620
Hahahaha!

2093
03:10:44,620 --> 03:10:46,620
Hahahaha!

2094
03:10:46,620 --> 03:10:48,620
I guess I can just go in there.

2095
03:10:48,620 --> 03:10:50,620
Hahahaha!

2096
03:10:50,620 --> 03:10:52,620
Yeah, even the game loves I'm.

2097
03:10:52,620 --> 03:10:54,620
Hahahaha!

2098
03:10:54,620 --> 03:10:56,620
I'm surprised she walked by me.

2099
03:10:56,620 --> 03:10:58,620
Hahahaha!

2100
03:10:58,620 --> 03:11:00,620
Okay, now she goes in the grass?

2101
03:11:00,620 --> 03:11:02,620
Yeah?

2102
03:11:02,620 --> 03:11:04,620
Hahahaha!

2103
03:11:10,620 --> 03:11:12,620
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

2104
03:11:12,620 --> 03:11:14,620
Are you kidding me?

2105
03:11:20,620 --> 03:11:22,620
Run? I wasn't supposed to go through that door?

2106
03:11:28,220 --> 03:11:30,220
Freakin' barrels.

2107
03:11:32,620 --> 03:11:34,620
Hahahaha!

2108
03:11:34,620 --> 03:11:36,620
Hahahaha!

2109
03:11:36,620 --> 03:11:38,620
Okay.

2110
03:11:38,620 --> 03:11:40,620
Hahahaha!

2111
03:11:40,620 --> 03:11:42,620
She's not chasing me.

2112
03:11:42,620 --> 03:11:44,620
I need to go back to get her.

2113
03:11:44,620 --> 03:11:46,620
Hahahaha!

2114
03:11:46,620 --> 03:11:48,620
Okay.

2115
03:11:48,620 --> 03:11:50,620
Hahahaha!

2116
03:11:50,620 --> 03:11:52,620
I should have bare-loaded her!

2117
03:11:52,620 --> 03:11:54,620
Hahahaha!

2118
03:11:54,620 --> 03:11:56,620
Hahahaha!

2119
03:11:56,620 --> 03:11:58,620
Hahahaha!

2120
03:11:58,620 --> 03:12:00,620
Hahahaha!

2121
03:12:00,620 --> 03:12:02,620
What am I supposed to do here?

2122
03:12:02,620 --> 03:12:04,620
Hahahaha!

2123
03:12:04,620 --> 03:12:06,620
Hahahaha!

2124
03:12:06,620 --> 03:12:08,620
You did everything right now.

2125
03:12:08,620 --> 03:12:10,620
It's all about not making mistakes.

2126
03:12:10,620 --> 03:12:12,620
Right, yeah.

2127
03:12:12,620 --> 03:12:14,620
I know how to do.

2128
03:12:14,620 --> 03:12:16,620
I know how to not make mistakes.

2129
03:12:16,620 --> 03:12:18,620
Hahahaha!

2130
03:12:20,620 --> 03:12:22,620
Look up.

2131
03:12:22,620 --> 03:12:24,620
Hahahaha!

2132
03:12:24,620 --> 03:12:26,620
Hahahaha!

2133
03:12:28,620 --> 03:12:30,620
Is she chasing me?

2134
03:12:30,620 --> 03:12:32,620
Hahahaha!

2135
03:12:36,620 --> 03:12:38,620
This fucking barrel, dude!

2136
03:12:38,620 --> 03:12:40,620
Hahahaha!

2137
03:12:40,620 --> 03:12:42,620
Okay, what do I do here?

2138
03:12:42,620 --> 03:12:44,620
What do I do there?

2139
03:12:44,620 --> 03:12:46,620
I'm still confused.

2140
03:12:46,620 --> 03:12:48,620
Hahahaha!

2141
03:12:48,620 --> 03:12:50,620
Hahahaha!

2142
03:12:52,620 --> 03:12:54,620
Turn around?

2143
03:12:54,620 --> 03:12:56,620
Ohhhhh!

2144
03:12:56,620 --> 03:12:58,620
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2145
03:12:58,620 --> 03:13:00,620
Hahahaha!

2146
03:13:00,620 --> 03:13:02,620
Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around!

2147
03:13:02,620 --> 03:13:04,620
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2148
03:13:04,620 --> 03:13:06,620
Hahahaha!

2149
03:13:06,620 --> 03:13:08,620
Okay.

2150
03:13:08,620 --> 03:13:10,620
She didn't come yet.

2151
03:13:10,620 --> 03:13:12,620
Okay.

2152
03:13:12,620 --> 03:13:14,620
Hahahaha!

2153
03:13:14,620 --> 03:13:16,620
Hahahaha!

2154
03:13:16,620 --> 03:13:19,620
Uh-uh.

2155
03:13:19,620 --> 03:13:23,620
Get cut.

2156
03:13:23,620 --> 03:13:38,620
I'm walking in the sewers right now.

2157
03:13:38,620 --> 03:13:40,620
Oh, fuck!

2158
03:13:46,620 --> 03:13:48,620
Let me turn the sound down a little.

2159
03:13:50,620 --> 03:13:52,620
Isn't he wonderful?

2160
03:13:55,620 --> 03:13:58,620
I'm still not excited for chapter three.

2161
03:14:00,620 --> 03:14:01,620
Okay.

2162
03:14:02,620 --> 03:14:04,620
Okay, I can do this. We're almost done.

2163
03:14:04,620 --> 03:14:06,620
Right, right, right, right, right. We're almost done after this.

2164
03:14:06,620 --> 03:14:08,620
This is it, right? This is like the last chase, right?

2165
03:14:08,620 --> 03:14:10,620
Please say yes. Please say yes. Say yes.

2166
03:14:11,620 --> 03:14:12,620
To me? Please say yes.

2167
03:14:12,620 --> 03:14:15,620
I feel like that bear was there on purpose, isn't it?

2168
03:14:16,620 --> 03:14:18,620
To fuck you over.

2169
03:14:19,620 --> 03:14:22,620
Laugh isn't really sexy anymore.

2170
03:14:23,620 --> 03:14:26,620
I don't want to play with you anymore. You're not sexy.

2171
03:14:37,620 --> 03:14:42,620
She legit sounds like she's painfully gagging on something.

2172
03:14:42,620 --> 03:14:44,620
Yeah, gagging on my dick!

2173
03:14:49,620 --> 03:14:55,620
It's not a skill issue. It's a game issue.

2174
03:14:56,620 --> 03:14:58,620
They just have to fix their aim.

2175
03:14:59,620 --> 03:15:03,620
The game obviously is poorly optimized here.

2176
03:15:03,620 --> 03:15:08,620
If they can't pick up my perfectly aimed mouse cursor.

2177
03:15:11,620 --> 03:15:13,620
Gagging on the two-way check.

2178
03:15:13,620 --> 03:15:16,620
Come on! Did I walk into her?

2179
03:15:20,620 --> 03:15:23,620
Shut up! There's so much to gag on it.

2180
03:15:23,620 --> 03:15:26,620
It'll go so deep in your throat just you fucking wait.

2181
03:15:29,620 --> 03:15:30,620
Cough.

2182
03:15:35,620 --> 03:15:36,620
Okay.

2183
03:15:37,620 --> 03:15:38,620
I'll do it this time.

2184
03:15:40,620 --> 03:15:42,620
Your throat will be so sore.

2185
03:15:42,620 --> 03:15:43,620
Your dentist is gonna be like,

2186
03:15:43,620 --> 03:15:47,620
God damn, were you gagging on a fucking...

2187
03:15:47,620 --> 03:15:49,620
I don't know.

2188
03:15:51,620 --> 03:15:54,620
Were you gagging on Amy's dick last night?

2189
03:15:54,620 --> 03:15:58,620
Because that's the only cock that would be long enough to make such...

2190
03:15:58,620 --> 03:16:00,620
such damage to your throat.

2191
03:16:04,620 --> 03:16:06,620
I got it that time!

2192
03:16:09,620 --> 03:16:11,620
I fucking got it that time!

2193
03:16:14,620 --> 03:16:15,620
Too slow.

2194
03:16:17,620 --> 03:16:18,620
The dentist knows?

2195
03:16:18,620 --> 03:16:22,620
Yeah, there's like bruising at the back of your throat sometimes.

2196
03:16:22,620 --> 03:16:24,620
The dentist will know.

2197
03:16:24,620 --> 03:16:27,620
I'll make sure that throat is bruised up, baby.

2198
03:16:35,620 --> 03:16:36,620
Fuck this barrel!

2199
03:16:53,620 --> 03:16:54,620
No!

2200
03:16:55,620 --> 03:16:56,620
Get up you fucker with my craft!

2201
03:16:56,620 --> 03:16:58,620
In my craft, in my craft, in my craft...

2202
03:16:58,620 --> 03:17:00,620
In my craft, in my craft, in my craft...

2203
03:17:00,620 --> 03:17:02,620
In my craft, in my craft, in my craft.

2204
03:17:07,620 --> 03:17:08,620
In my craft, in my craft, in my craft, in my craft.

2205
03:17:08,620 --> 03:17:10,620
In my craft, in game, in game, in game, in game, in game, in game,

2206
03:17:10,620 --> 03:17:12,620
In game, in game, I, I, I died in game.

2207
03:17:12,620 --> 03:17:14,620
I died in game.

2208
03:17:22,620 --> 03:17:25,620
My throat is literally killing me right now.

2209
03:17:25,620 --> 03:17:26,120
Oh.

2210
03:17:36,120 --> 03:17:39,620
Wait, I take a long time because I'm trying to.

2211
03:17:39,620 --> 03:17:44,620
I'm trying to ink correctly.

2212
03:17:44,620 --> 03:17:45,620
Oh my god.

2213
03:17:50,620 --> 03:17:51,620
Oh my god.

2214
03:17:52,620 --> 03:17:53,620
Oh my god.

2215
03:18:02,620 --> 03:18:05,620
Okay, if I don't get it this time, I'm literally stopping.

2216
03:18:05,620 --> 03:18:08,620
And we'll finish it the next time.

2217
03:18:08,620 --> 03:18:10,620
I can't.

2218
03:18:13,620 --> 03:18:15,620
We'll finish the next time.

2219
03:18:19,620 --> 03:18:21,620
I didn't even see it.

2220
03:18:21,620 --> 03:18:24,620
I had it and I didn't even know.

2221
03:18:24,620 --> 03:18:26,620
I didn't know what I was doing.

2222
03:18:26,620 --> 03:18:28,620
How do people do this?

2223
03:18:28,620 --> 03:18:31,620
This is like way harder than the first chapter.

2224
03:18:52,620 --> 03:18:55,620
What do I do?

2225
03:18:55,620 --> 03:18:56,620
Please tell me what to do.

2226
03:18:56,620 --> 03:18:57,620
Please tell me what to do.

2227
03:19:19,620 --> 03:19:20,620
Why is it so slow?

2228
03:19:20,620 --> 03:19:23,620
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

2229
03:19:35,620 --> 03:19:38,620
Die, bitch! Die!

2230
03:19:43,620 --> 03:19:46,620
I love seeing you in pain!

2231
03:19:47,620 --> 03:19:50,620
That's right scream for me!

2232
03:19:56,620 --> 03:19:57,620
Oh my god.

2233
03:20:17,620 --> 03:20:23,620
Okay, we did it.

2234
03:20:23,620 --> 03:20:24,620
Right?

2235
03:20:31,620 --> 03:20:34,620
Thank you for the head pass.

2236
03:20:35,620 --> 03:20:36,620
Oh.

2237
03:20:43,620 --> 03:20:44,620
Is this it?

2238
03:20:44,620 --> 03:20:45,620
Please tell me.

2239
03:20:45,620 --> 03:20:46,620
Please tell me.

2240
03:20:46,620 --> 03:20:47,620
That's it.

2241
03:20:56,620 --> 03:20:59,620
I know I'm so good at games.

2242
03:20:59,620 --> 03:21:06,620
Like, really, they should have considered that I might play this game and make it harder

2243
03:21:06,620 --> 03:21:08,620
because this was just too easy.

2244
03:21:10,620 --> 03:21:12,620
Hi, I fucking saved your life, bitch.

2245
03:21:20,620 --> 03:21:21,620
What?

2246
03:21:24,620 --> 03:21:26,620
Do I have to read that?

2247
03:21:29,620 --> 03:21:30,620
I can't read that.

2248
03:21:38,620 --> 03:21:41,620
Opening the control station.

2249
03:21:41,620 --> 03:21:42,620
Just pull both levers?

2250
03:21:42,620 --> 03:21:43,620
Oh.

2251
03:21:49,620 --> 03:21:51,620
Yeah, double fist that shit.

2252
03:21:51,620 --> 03:21:53,620
It's not working.

2253
03:21:53,620 --> 03:21:58,620
Slap, puppy?

2254
03:22:02,620 --> 03:22:03,620
Is that it?

2255
03:22:03,620 --> 03:22:04,620
Is that it?

2256
03:22:07,620 --> 03:22:08,620
Yeah.

2257
03:22:10,620 --> 03:22:11,620
Okay.

2258
03:22:14,620 --> 03:22:15,620
Okay.

2259
03:22:19,620 --> 03:22:22,620
I'm so happy!

2260
03:22:24,620 --> 03:22:28,620
Oh my god, that was such an emotional roller coaster.

2261
03:22:28,620 --> 03:22:29,620
Where am I going?

2262
03:22:38,620 --> 03:22:39,620
You skipped a tape?

2263
03:22:39,620 --> 03:22:40,620
I don't fucking care.

2264
03:22:46,620 --> 03:22:47,620
Was it important?

2265
03:22:47,620 --> 03:22:49,620
Was it really important?

2266
03:22:54,620 --> 03:22:56,620
That thing, that thing, that thing, that thing.

2267
03:22:59,620 --> 03:23:00,620
Do I press buttons?

2268
03:23:06,620 --> 03:23:07,620
I'm confused.

2269
03:23:09,620 --> 03:23:10,620
Do I press the buttons?

2270
03:23:12,620 --> 03:23:13,620
Oh.

2271
03:23:14,620 --> 03:23:15,620
Oh, oh.

2272
03:23:16,620 --> 03:23:18,620
Oh, I have to make them the right colors.

2273
03:23:24,620 --> 03:23:25,620
Wait.

2274
03:23:34,620 --> 03:23:36,620
So this thing is red?

2275
03:23:37,620 --> 03:23:38,620
Okay.

2276
03:23:39,620 --> 03:23:41,620
The other thing is yellow.

2277
03:23:43,620 --> 03:23:44,620
The next thing is red.

2278
03:23:45,620 --> 03:23:46,620
Okay.

2279
03:23:46,620 --> 03:23:47,620
The last thing is blue.

2280
03:23:48,620 --> 03:23:49,620
Oh wait.

2281
03:23:54,620 --> 03:23:56,620
Oh, now I have to put them in the right order.

2282
03:24:01,620 --> 03:24:03,620
Red, yellow, red, blue.

2283
03:24:06,620 --> 03:24:07,620
Now what?

2284
03:24:07,620 --> 03:24:08,620
It's in the right order.

2285
03:24:10,620 --> 03:24:12,620
Hit the arrow to put them in the same order.

2286
03:24:12,620 --> 03:24:13,620
Yeah, they're in the same order.

2287
03:24:14,620 --> 03:24:15,620
Yeah.

2288
03:24:16,620 --> 03:24:17,620
Red, yellow, red, blue.

2289
03:24:18,620 --> 03:24:19,620
The color.

2290
03:24:19,620 --> 03:24:21,620
I've seen subscribers break their brains on this puzzle.

2291
03:24:21,620 --> 03:24:23,620
You understood it immediately?

2292
03:24:23,620 --> 03:24:24,620
Password three?

2293
03:24:26,620 --> 03:24:27,620
One, four, two, three.

2294
03:24:29,620 --> 03:24:30,620
How do I change the numbers?

2295
03:24:38,620 --> 03:24:39,620
But how do I change them?

2296
03:24:43,620 --> 03:24:44,620
Push them?

2297
03:24:49,620 --> 03:24:50,620
Punch them?

2298
03:24:59,620 --> 03:25:00,620
I can't click on it.

2299
03:25:16,620 --> 03:25:17,620
Huh.

2300
03:25:19,620 --> 03:25:20,620
Click on the faces?

2301
03:25:22,620 --> 03:25:23,620
Oh.

2302
03:25:23,620 --> 03:25:26,620
One, four, two, three.

2303
03:25:28,620 --> 03:25:29,620
Go.

2304
03:25:34,620 --> 03:25:35,620
Go.

2305
03:25:35,620 --> 03:25:36,620
Let's go.

2306
03:25:37,620 --> 03:25:38,620
Let's leave this.

2307
03:25:38,620 --> 03:25:39,620
Oh, is it going?

2308
03:25:40,620 --> 03:25:41,620
Yippee.

2309
03:25:42,620 --> 03:25:43,620
Re-game.

2310
03:25:49,620 --> 03:25:50,620
Red lever's a break?

2311
03:25:50,620 --> 03:25:51,620
Oh, we don't want to break.

2312
03:25:52,620 --> 03:25:53,620
Choo-choo.

2313
03:25:53,620 --> 03:25:54,620
Can I go choo-choo?

2314
03:25:54,620 --> 03:25:55,620
Choo-choo.

2315
03:25:57,620 --> 03:25:58,620
Choo-choo.

2316
03:26:00,620 --> 03:26:01,620
Yay.

2317
03:26:01,620 --> 03:26:02,620
Choo-choo.

2318
03:26:02,620 --> 03:26:03,620
Choo-choo.

2319
03:26:04,620 --> 03:26:05,620
Oh my god, I'm so tired.

2320
03:26:06,620 --> 03:26:07,620
Let's go.

2321
03:26:11,620 --> 03:26:13,620
I ran out of water again.

2322
03:26:14,620 --> 03:26:15,620
Phew.

2323
03:26:18,620 --> 03:26:19,620
Get applauded.

2324
03:26:19,620 --> 03:26:20,620
Get applauded.

2325
03:26:24,620 --> 03:26:25,620
Hm?

2326
03:26:29,620 --> 03:26:30,620
Ew.

2327
03:26:36,620 --> 03:26:37,620
Whoa.

2328
03:26:39,620 --> 03:26:40,620
What?

2329
03:26:43,620 --> 03:26:44,620
What?

2330
03:26:51,620 --> 03:26:52,620
Sounds like me?

2331
03:26:56,620 --> 03:26:58,620
Time to figure out what's happening.

2332
03:27:01,620 --> 03:27:02,620
Hm?

2333
03:27:06,620 --> 03:27:09,620
I'm not good at copying voices like Chibi.

2334
03:27:11,620 --> 03:27:12,620
What?

2335
03:27:13,620 --> 03:27:14,620
Hm?

2336
03:27:16,620 --> 03:27:17,620
Hm?

2337
03:27:18,620 --> 03:27:19,620
What happened?

2338
03:27:24,620 --> 03:27:26,620
What happened?

2339
03:27:26,620 --> 03:27:28,620
Why is it going faster?

2340
03:27:28,620 --> 03:27:29,620
Where are we going?

2341
03:27:29,620 --> 03:27:32,620
Why are we going so fucking fast?

2342
03:27:32,620 --> 03:27:33,620
Are we tilting?

2343
03:27:34,620 --> 03:27:36,620
Are we getting tilted right now?

2344
03:27:37,620 --> 03:27:38,620
Get tilted.

2345
03:27:39,620 --> 03:27:42,620
I feel like something bad is going to happen.

2346
03:27:43,620 --> 03:27:44,620
Hm?

2347
03:27:46,620 --> 03:27:47,620
What do I do?

2348
03:27:47,620 --> 03:27:48,620
Do-do.

2349
03:27:48,620 --> 03:27:50,620
We're going to die.

2350
03:27:51,620 --> 03:27:52,620
Stop train.

2351
03:27:53,620 --> 03:27:54,620
I can't.

2352
03:27:54,620 --> 03:27:55,620
No brakes.

2353
03:27:55,620 --> 03:27:57,620
No brakes on the train.

2354
03:28:01,620 --> 03:28:03,620
It's not going to work.

2355
03:28:04,620 --> 03:28:05,620
My hand.

2356
03:28:05,620 --> 03:28:07,620
Don't rip my hand off.

2357
03:28:14,620 --> 03:28:16,620
Oh, that was it, wasn't it?

2358
03:28:21,620 --> 03:28:22,620
Playcare?

2359
03:28:25,620 --> 03:28:26,620
Never mind playcare.

2360
03:28:26,620 --> 03:28:29,620
I need some fucking aftercare after getting fucked in the ass so hard.

2361
03:28:32,620 --> 03:28:33,620
We did it.

2362
03:28:33,620 --> 03:28:34,620
We did it.

2363
03:28:34,620 --> 03:28:35,620
We did it.

2364
03:28:35,620 --> 03:28:36,620
We did it.

2365
03:28:36,620 --> 03:28:37,620
We did it.

2366
03:28:37,620 --> 03:28:38,620
We did it.

2367
03:28:38,620 --> 03:28:39,620
Chapter 3 tomorrow?

2368
03:28:39,620 --> 03:28:42,620
No, I already have something planned for chapter 3.

2369
03:28:42,620 --> 03:28:45,620
I already have stuff planned for next week too.

2370
03:28:45,620 --> 03:28:48,620
Maybe the week after that we can do chapter 3.

2371
03:28:49,620 --> 03:28:52,620
There's Jacks but I see Big Spider.

2372
03:29:01,620 --> 03:29:03,620
Yeah, I did it.

2373
03:29:03,620 --> 03:29:04,620
I did it.

2374
03:29:11,620 --> 03:29:12,620
Is that it?

2375
03:29:12,620 --> 03:29:13,620
There's not like other-

2376
03:29:14,620 --> 03:29:15,620
Shut up.

2377
03:29:15,620 --> 03:29:17,620
It is not story early for another horror game.

2378
03:29:17,620 --> 03:29:18,620
I can't.

2379
03:29:18,620 --> 03:29:19,620
My mind is-

2380
03:29:19,620 --> 03:29:21,620
I've been mind broken.

2381
03:29:22,620 --> 03:29:24,620
What do you want as a reward?

2382
03:29:26,620 --> 03:29:27,620
A shower.

2383
03:29:29,620 --> 03:29:30,620
A shower.

2384
03:29:31,620 --> 03:29:34,620
We can shower together as a reward.

2385
03:29:38,620 --> 03:29:41,620
A shower and a cough drop and some tea.

2386
03:29:41,620 --> 03:29:43,620
That's what I want as a reward.

2387
03:29:45,620 --> 03:29:46,620
Yeah, together.

2388
03:29:52,620 --> 03:29:53,620
Quit.

2389
03:29:53,620 --> 03:29:54,620
Quit.

2390
03:29:58,620 --> 03:29:59,620
Okay.

2391
03:30:00,620 --> 03:30:01,620
Quit.

2392
03:30:08,620 --> 03:30:09,620
Oh, shit.

2393
03:30:09,620 --> 03:30:10,620
Now the chat has to cap up.

2394
03:30:10,620 --> 03:30:11,620
Cap up.

2395
03:30:11,620 --> 03:30:12,620
Check.

2396
03:30:12,620 --> 03:30:13,620
Check up.

2397
03:30:13,620 --> 03:30:14,620
Check.

2398
03:30:14,620 --> 03:30:15,620
Check.

2399
03:30:15,620 --> 03:30:16,620
Check.

2400
03:30:18,620 --> 03:30:19,620
Catch up.

2401
03:30:20,620 --> 03:30:21,620
Okay.

2402
03:30:22,620 --> 03:30:23,620
Yeah.

2403
03:30:23,620 --> 03:30:24,620
Thank you for coming.

2404
03:30:24,620 --> 03:30:25,620
I did it.

2405
03:30:25,620 --> 03:30:26,620
I usually-

2406
03:30:26,620 --> 03:30:27,620
I usually release stream too.

2407
03:30:27,620 --> 03:30:30,620
I'm fucking blinking like a fucking frog right now.

2408
03:30:30,620 --> 03:30:31,620
I usually only-

2409
03:30:31,620 --> 03:30:33,620
Okay, that's really distracting.

2410
03:30:33,620 --> 03:30:36,620
I usually only stream for two hours.

2411
03:30:36,620 --> 03:30:38,620
But I guess we were here for the long run.

2412
03:30:38,620 --> 03:30:42,620
Thank you so much for coming and staying

2413
03:30:42,620 --> 03:30:44,620
and helping me the whole time.

2414
03:30:44,620 --> 03:30:48,620
Encouraging me and praising me when I was going insane.

2415
03:30:51,620 --> 03:30:52,620
I'll see you tomorrow.

2416
03:30:52,620 --> 03:30:54,620
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.

2417
03:30:54,620 --> 03:30:57,620
I think it's going to be really funny and exciting.

2418
03:31:00,620 --> 03:31:01,620
Bye-bye.

2419
03:31:02,620 --> 03:31:04,620
I love you, big bro.

2420
03:31:24,620 --> 03:31:25,620
Bye-bye.
