If you thought me being flat and short was rough, just wait until you see my lore.
Oh, wait, I can't spoil that yet.
Dammit!
Ahem.
I'm Imi Bizu, the smallest member of Yolor at 140cm tall, but I'm still growing, I swear.
Whoever has my voodoo doll out there, please stretch me out so I can be tall.
I don't think it would be wise to bully me.
No, if anything, I'm the one who bullies.
I suppose it'd be fair if you called me a hex maniac since I do have an inexplicable
connection to the dead, but that's not the only freaky sh** I get up to.
Why not find out more at my debut on June 1st?
I'll be waiting for you, Onii-chan.
