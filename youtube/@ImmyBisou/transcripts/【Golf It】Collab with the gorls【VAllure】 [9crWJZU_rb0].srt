We made it on.

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
It's okay if you can hear them and me properly.

10
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,360
We avoided the curse of the streamers and actually booted up the game we wanted to.

11
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Christmas weekend round of applause.

12
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360

Let's go first.

26

EP.

27
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
Volume good.

28
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
Yes.

29
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
Volume good.

30
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,360
Some of the girls.

31
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Volume.

32
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Volume.

33
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Oh my God.

34
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
I have volume.

35
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Oh my God.

36
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Why are you 150?

37
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,360
I had to turn you down.

38
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:19,360
I had to turn you down.

39
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,360
Holy shit.

40
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Finally done it.

41
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
Wait for who donated that.

42
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,360
Who is anonymous?

43
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Anonymous 100.

44
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,360
Thank you anonymous.

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
We love you.

46
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
Wow.

47
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,360
Thanks Mr. Anonymous.

48
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Okay.

49
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Should I start the game?

50
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Does anyone want?

51
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
Do you want more strokes?

52
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Do you want more?

53
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
I would love more strokes.

54
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
Who wants to?

55
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
What's the auto scoreboard?

56
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
Mad bitch.

57
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
What's the collision?

58
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Yeah.

59
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
The collision will be funny.

60
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
Okay.

61
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
What is collision?

62
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Wait, wait, what is collision?

63
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
We can hit each other.

64
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
We can hit each other's balls.

65
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Oh my God.

66
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Did you guys customize your balls?

67
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
No.

68
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Oh.

69
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
No?

70
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
No?

71
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
No?

72
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
No?

73
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
No?

74
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
No?

75
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
No?

76
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
No?

77
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
No?

78
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
No?

79
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
No?

80
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
How do you do that?

81
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
How do I customize my balls?

82
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
I can customize my balls?

83
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Yeah.

84
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,360
It's on the main screen.

85
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
You guys didn't customize your balls?

86
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
Help left sit.

87
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Oh my gosh.

88
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
I can customize my ball.

89
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Thank you.

90
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
Give me a second.

91
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
What's situm?

92
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
SDMM.

93
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
I thought you said SDD.

94
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,360
It's in top left.

95
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
Customized ball.

96
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,360
And it's put SDMM on situm.

97
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
So cute.

98
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,360
I have a flaming hot ball.

99
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
Okay.

100
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Now my ball has hearts.

101
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,360
How do you customize the ball?

102
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,360
There's one with X's in me.

103
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
There is where?

104
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
Oh, I see it.

105
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
You can customize my ball.

106
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,360
That's my ball.

107
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Everyone's so excited to have their own custom ball.

108
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
Oh my God.

109
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
That's amazing.

110
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
All right.

111
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
Beautiful.

112
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,360
You can customize your balls.

113
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm almost done.

114
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
I need to like radio.

115
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,360
You can put a hat on your ball.

116
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
Am I ready?

117
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
I can't tell if I'm ready or if I'm not ready.

118
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,360
I don't know if green or yellow is ready.

119
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
Green, green is ready.

120
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Oh, okay.

121
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,360
I'm ready.

122
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,360
Azura, are you ready?

123
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,000
What's your name?

124
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,960
Yeah.

125
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,700
Oh, yeah.

126
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,200
Yeah.

127
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,160
Well, wait.

128
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,100
I don't think she is.

129
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,660
I don't think she is.

130
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,160
Yeah.

131
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,600
I don't think she's.

132
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,560
That's like.

133
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,200
Well, oh, not every player is ready.

134
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Not every player is ready.

135
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,960
Already done.

136
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,800
I need a ready.

137
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,040
Oh, I'm going to press the button.

138
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,540
Yes.

139
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,040
Yes!

140
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,520
Oh, hell yeah.

141
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Hell yeah.

142
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,520
Hell yeah.

143
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,520
Oh, god.

144
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,520
Oh, no.

145
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
Hey, yo.

146
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,760
How do we play?

147
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,080
How do I play?

148
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,760
What button do I press?

149
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,360
Oh, what is happening?

150
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,520
Wait, what happened?

151
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
How did I?

152
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,400
How do I do this?

153
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Hello?

154
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,200
Huh?

155
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
This is so weird.

156
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Um.

157
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Oh, I'm so close.

158
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,800
I don't know how to do this.

159
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,480
Wait, I don't know how to do it either.

160
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,040
How do you?

161
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,040
Aim.

162
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
Click.

163
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
And then click.

164
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Oh, this is great.

165
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Oh.

166
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
This is so cool.

167
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Oh.

168
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
Oh, shit.

169
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
Oh, click in your ass.

170
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Hi.

171
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
I'm bogey.

172
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
I don't know.

173
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
I'm bogey.

174
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
She's just so cute.

175
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
You got to pull it back early pop.

176
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Zura will say thank you once the collab's over.

177
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
But thank you, everyone, for supporting this.

178
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
Zura, we really appreciate you having me there.

179
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Uh-huh.

180
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,040
We love you.

181
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
Ignore me.

182
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,040
I think I know it's like a long road.

183
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,040
You know it's like a long road.

184
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
We're in the road.

185
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
It cannot give up.

186
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Oh my god.

187
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
I'm not flesh.

188
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,040
Yes.

189
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Broke.

190
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,040
What broke?

191
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
What?

192
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
That was trash.

193
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,040
No way.

194
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,040
The TTS broke.

195
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
Oh, fuck it.

196
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,040
We off the fucking thing.

197
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:29,040
I'm still struggling to figure out how to play right now.

198
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,040
You got this little sis.

199
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Yeah, there you go.

200
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,040
No, not the double boogie.

201
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,040
The double what?

202
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,040
The boogie.

203
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,040
The boogie, of course.

204
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,040
The double boogie.

205
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
The boogie.

206
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,040
Oh, shit.

207
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,040
The boogie is...

208
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,040
Where's the hole?

209
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,040
In the ass.

210
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Oh my god.

211
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
Oh my god.

212
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,040
I'm scared.

213
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,040
Hit it again slow.

214
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Damn, everyone got a hole in one.

215
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,040
Let's go.

216
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,040
Oh.

217
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,040
I thought I was going to be the only one that didn't get it and I was going to cry.

218
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,040
Everyone's anonymous.

219
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,040
Come on, fuck.

220
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,040
Wait, all the donations are anonymous?

221
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,040
Yeah.

222
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,040
Thank you.

223
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,040
Thank you.

224
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,040
No, no, no, no.

225
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,040
I'm trying to learn how to do this.

226
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,040
This is hard.

227
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,040
It is hard.

228
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,040
Fuck.

229
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,040
But I'm harder.

230
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,040
Fuck.

231
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,040
No Mary.

232
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,040
I think Mary said her love heart is coming off of her.

233
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,040
No, I didn't mean to do that.

234
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,040
Damien, you guys are struggling on this.

235
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Here we go.

236
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040
I am terrible at this.

237
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
Please.

238
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,040
Oh my god.

239
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,040
Triple boogie, that's fine.

240
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,040
We didn't play a practice run, to be honest.

241
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
We're just going to do it only.

242
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,040
We just went all seven strokes for different folks.

243
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Oh my god.

244
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Where is the hole?

245
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Where is the hole?

246
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
Oh, shit.

247
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Fuck.

248
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,040
Oh my god.

249
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Thank you.

250
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,040
Thank you.

251
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,040
Thank you, Mr. Anonymous.

252
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,040
Thank you, Mr. Anonymous.

253
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
Oh, frick.

254
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,040
Hold on.

255
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
Oh, frick.

256
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,040
It is really dark in this one.

257
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,040
I see, why are you on my back side right now?

258
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,040
I want to.

259
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,040
I do what I want.

260
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
I can't see.

261
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,040
I'll get the action show.

262
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,040
Am I just gonna golf?

263
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,040
Oh, shit.

264
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,040
What gamer?

265
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
Golf, golf, golf, golf.

266
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
No way.

267
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Edging, edging, edging.

268
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,040
Edging the rim.

269
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,040
I'm so mad.

270
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,040
I'm so mad.

271
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,040
Oh my god.

272
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,040
All right, here we go.

273
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,040
We got to do...

274
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,040
Oh, I did it.

275
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Where the fuck I am?

276
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Come on.

277
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,040
Where the fuck I am?

278
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
Okay, hold on.

279
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
These are actually kind of easy.

280
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,040
I missed the hole.

281
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
What the hell?

282
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,040
I'm still sleeping.

283
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Why?

284
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Why?

285
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,040
Oh, you guys are new.

286
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
Who was that?

287
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,040
It was Zara.

288
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,040
Fuck this shit.

289
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,040
Me and Mercy are struggling over here.

290
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,040
I can tell.

291
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,040
I'm glad. I'm finally not the one

292
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,040
struggling in the game.

293
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,040
I'm in my life.

294
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,040
I'll thank you.

295
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,040
Shut up.

296
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,040
Toxic golf.

297
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,040
You know what, me and Mercy,

298
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,040
we're fine on the bottom.

299
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,040
We'll lift everybody up.

300
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,040
I don't want to be on the bottom.

301
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,040
I want to be on top.

302
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,040
Where's the hole?

303
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,040
Well, you can come off this map.

304
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,040
Can I jump?

305
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,040
I don't know.

306
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,040
You can come off this map.

307
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
Okay, right, enough.

308
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,040
That's three strokes. I keep trolling.

309
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,040
I'm trolling.

310
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Come on.

311
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
Fuck. Damn.

312
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,040
Am I going to roll all the way back?

313
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,040
No!

314
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,040
What?

315
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,040
Stay, stay, stay, stay.

316
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,040
Oh, my God. I'm going to permit.

317
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
You're shooting me right now!

318
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,040
I'm throwing.

319
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,040
Guys, guys, what the hell is this?

320
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,040
This is no fun.

321
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,040
I'm going to make it.

322
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,040
$100!

323
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
I'm throwing. I'm going to throw.

324
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,040
$100!

325
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,040
No, no, no, no.

326
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
I'm going to cry. Where am I?

327
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Hello?

328
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,040
What the fuck am I supposed to say?

329
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,040
No!

330
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,040
I killed AC.

331
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
I killed AC.

332
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,040
I'm creeping. I'm on the edge of glory.

333
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,040
What the fuck is this?

334
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
I'm going to live in the room.

335
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
Who picked the main step?

336
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
What am I doing?

337
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
Who picked the main step?

338
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,040
Of course.

339
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,040
Shawty.

340
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
Shawty with the salt.

341
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,040
I hate it.

342
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Is there a maximum amount?

343
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,040
There has to be a maximum amount.

344
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
It's 12 strokes.

345
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,040
Well, it can be, because I've managed to...

346
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
My battle is 12.

347
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,040
I guess it's not.

348
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,040
Shortened behavior.

349
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Shortened behavior.

350
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,040
Almost whole in one.

351
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,040
That was...

352
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,040
I needed to even the playing field.

353
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,040
Oh, okay.

354
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
I'm sorry, I swore.

355
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,040
How dare you swear?

356
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
I can't believe you, Mercy.

357
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,040
How could you swear?

358
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,040
I'm so fucking stupid.

359
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,040
I got the trick shot.

360
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,040
Sorry, I said such bad words.

361
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,040
I will remember to fuck myself.

362
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,040
You're gonna fuck yourself?

363
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
I can't believe you're going to fuck yourself.

364
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,040
Are you winning?

365
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
What the fuck is the salt thing?

366
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,040
It's me.

367
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
I put salt on myself.

368
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,040
It's like one-on-one.

369
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,040
It's like one-on-one.

370
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Didn't you know golf started in Scotland?

371
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,040
To have like a racial passive to this.

372
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,040
I'm not even kidding.

373
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Stop, stop, stop.

374
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Please, please, please.

375
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,040
Oh, thank god.

376
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
We have thrown in that 17.

377
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
No, on my screen.

378
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,040
I see the bottom.

379
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,040
For all your 12 strokes.

380
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,040
What was that?

381
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,040
Oh, you're supposed to go in the middle.

382
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,040
Let's go.

383
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Strawny, get out of my face.

384
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Strawny, follow me up.

385
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
I was doing so good.

386
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,040
What the fuck?

387
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,040
Fuck this.

388
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,040
Are you reaching over golf right now?

389
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,040
Yes.

390
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,040
Because I always fucking suck at games.

391
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,040
Give me a game.

392
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Give me a second.

393
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
I got a spammer in chat.

394
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
Damn.

395
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,040
What are they saying?

396
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Monkey.

397
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,040
I'm gonna fart on him.

398
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,040
We're farting on him.

399
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,040
Shitin on him.

400
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,040
Shibin and Fartin.

401
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Fartin on him.

402
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,040
I'm tired because I blocked that.

403
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,040
Motherfucker.

404
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,040
You're tired?

405
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,040
What? That was like a pro strat.

406
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Hold on.

407
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,040
What the hell?

408
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Hello?

409
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Damn it.

410
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Where's the hole?

411
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Where?

412
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,040
It's like through the yellow tunnel.

413
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
I found it.

414
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
I keep on getting the...

415
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
So mad.

416
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,040
That was gonna be A plus plus.

417
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Why do I have to be behind whatever the fuck this is?

418
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,040
What does bogey mean?

419
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Bogey?

420
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,040
Bogey is three.

421
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,040
I'm being hit.

422
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,040
I'm gonna start choosing violence.

423
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,040
I'm gonna start targeting others.

424
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,040
Don't sabotage us.

425
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,040
Wait, they're moving?

426
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
The goal is moving.

427
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,040
No fucking way.

428
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
What the hell?

429
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
We gotta time it.

430
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,040
We need to pick the easy peasy levels.

431
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,040
What is this?

432
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,040
I'm sorry.

433
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Where am I?

434
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,040
There's no way we're supposed to just...

435
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
What the fuck is this?

436
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Wait, I don't know.

437
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,040
How are you supposed to...

438
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
I'm sorry.

439
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,040
I missed something.

440
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,040
How am I supposed to fucking do this?

441
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Hi, Amy.

442
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,040
I'm begging.

443
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Let me come a little bit closer.

444
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
Shit.

445
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,040
I did it before I came.

446
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,040
I got this.

447
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Bad timing. It's okay.

448
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Okay, we're still here.

449
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
We're still here.

450
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,040
I'm going too gently.

451
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,040
I don't think he's still alive.

452
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,040
I'm sorry.

453
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
I'm so close.

454
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
No!

455
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Wait, that actually almost helped me.

456
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,040
Come on.

457
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,040
Let me go.

458
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Let me go first.

459
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Shit! I'm sorry.

460
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,040
Fuck this shit.

461
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,040
This one's really hard.

462
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,040
What the hell was that, Amy?

463
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,040
I did it!

464
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,040
Wait, did anyone get in the hole?

465
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,040
Damn.

466
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,040
I'm throwing myself on the train tracks, for real.

467
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,040
I was literally...

468
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,040
I'm about to end it all.

469
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,040
Why is this so hard?

470
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,040
Fuck that!

471
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,040
Azura did it.

472
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
I did it in the hole.

473
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,040
Okay, I'm going to come a little bit closer.

474
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
I don't think this is happening.

475
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,040
No, wait! How did I not get in the hole?

476
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
You did get it.

477
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,040
You did get it, Mercy.

478
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,040
You got it, Mercy.

479
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,040
Oh, I got it.

480
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Thank you so much.

481
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Congratulations.

482
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,040
Thank you.

483
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Thank you for the 25, Mr. Anonymous.

484
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,040
Why did I get penalized 17?

485
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,040
No one else got penalized 17.

486
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Why would you say it like that?

487
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Penalized?

488
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,040
What did you say?

489
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,040
Penalized?

490
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,040
Penalized.

491
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,040
Where's the thing?

492
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,040
All the way over there.

493
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Alright, let's go.

494
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,040
Wait, how do you say penis

495
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,040
and how do you spell penalized?

496
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,040
P-E-N-I

497
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
P...

498
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,040
Penalized?

499
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,040
Okay, I'm watching.

500
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,040
I don't know how to spell it.

501
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,040
Listen to me.

502
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,040
Where's the goal?

503
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,040
In the hole.

504
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
The fucking tree!

505
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
What am I hitting?

506
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,040
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

507
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Wait, any of these is the goal?

508
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,040
I wish I could have just said

509
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,040
that I've never played this game before.

510
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Please, Johnny, how do you say pen?

511
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Please.

512
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Pen.

513
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,040
Pen.

514
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
Pen.

515
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,040
Pen.

516
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,040
Penalized.

517
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,040
Penalized.

518
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,040
Penalized.

519
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Please, for the love of God.

520
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,040
These things.

521
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,040
These main show.

522
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,040
Oh, these are for the love of the holy goddess Azura.

523
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
That was far too hard.

524
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,040
Oh, God.

525
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,040
Which one is the hole?

526
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,040
Are they all the holes?

527
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,040
My hole.

528
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
Oh, wait, the one with the flag.

529
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Oh, wait.

530
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,040
How am I supposed to...

531
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,040
I'm glad I'm not the one struggling.

532
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,040
I'm still at the fucking start.

533
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,040
Hell yeah.

534
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,040
I'm still at the start too.

535
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,040
Oh, yeah.

536
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,040
Okay, I did it. I did it. I made it.

537
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,040
I made that. All right, let's go.

538
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Now I just realized I forgot

539
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,040
to turn off this.

540
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,040
What?

541
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
What? Are you done?

542
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,040
What have you done?

543
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,040
Nothing. So they didn't do anything.

544
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,040
Did you have your background music on?

545
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,040
No.

546
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Mine is. I saw my background music on.

547
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,040
There was.

548
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
Okay, all right.

549
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,040
Where is it?

550
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,040
It's the same place as before.

551
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Who hit me?

552
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,040
I'm going this way. I'm following in me.

553
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Spanked it rather gently that time.

554
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,040
Do apologize.

555
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,040
Let's try that a bit harder.

556
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,040
Oh, all right.

557
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,040
I'm on X games.

558
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,040
So is Emmy.

559
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,040
No!

560
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
Stay, stay, stay.

561
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Hey.

562
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,040
That was so funny.

563
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,040
Son of a...

564
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,040
Double bogey.

565
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,040
Bye.

566
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Someone literally goes to my stream.

567
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,040
I switch streams just to say it's

568
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,040
Penalize.

569
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,040
Penalize.

570
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
Penalize.

571
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Penalize.

572
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
What the fuck happened?

573
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,040
What are you doing?

574
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
Fuck!

575
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,040
I'm about to die in money.

576
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Frozen?

577
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
No, I killed Icy.

578
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
No, I killed Icy.

579
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
I see like...

580
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Glitching for me.

581
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
Let's go home.

582
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
What the fuck?

583
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,040
What is this?

584
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
You guys suck at golf.

585
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
I will shove those golf balls

586
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,040
in your mouth and ass.

587
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
I'm telling you amazing.

588
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
Azura is doing good.

589
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
Azura is doing good.

590
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
If I make girl look clearly...

591
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,040
How do we get over to this one?

592
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,040
It's always a good game.

593
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
We've all seen it multiple times.

594
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
Yeah, Azura is just nothing fucking new.

595
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
This is her comeuppance.

596
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,040
This is the way for me.

597
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
I did not hit her.

598
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,040
I did not hit her.

599
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,040
I did not hit her.

600
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
I did not hit her.

601
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,040
I did not hit her.

602
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,040
Okay, that was a bit too hard.

603
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
I was so close.

604
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
What?

605
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,040
I have to be back all the way over here.

606
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
Are you kidding me right now?

607
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Fucking shit.

608
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,040
Please stop.

609
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,040
We'll play the beginner map.

610
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
I didn't know there was beginner maps

611
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,040
and hard maps.

612
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Golf with friends?

613
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Enemies.

614
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Battle over y'all?

615
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Golf?

616
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Alright, here we go, folks.

617
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Here you go.

618
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Here's a bunch of nothing.

619
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,040
Girl, girl, girl.

620
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,040
Wait, I also got monkey spam.

621
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,040
You also got monkey spam?

622
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,040
What the hell?

623
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
Chongo, what are you doing, brother?

624
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Don't even say their name.

625
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,040
They love attention.

626
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,040
I wish I had mods. That'd be great.

627
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,040
Same.

628
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
I think everyone's mods are not used to this time.

629
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
They're like asleep right now.

630
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,040
I remember.

631
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
Yeah, thank you for

632
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
membering.

633
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
Azura.

634
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,040
Thank you for the member.

635
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,040
What was his name again?

636
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,040
We can all celebrate his name.

637
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,040
What was his name again?

638
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,040
Azura.

639
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,040
For the member?

640
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Yeah.

641
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
I'm now recovering from this.

642
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
There's no recovery.

643
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
Because of golf.

644
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Thank you.

645
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,040
Thank you.

646
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,040
Oh, my God.

647
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Siegfried?

648
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,040
I don't know. I'm just guessing.

649
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Thank you, Mr. Siegfried.

650
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Thank you, Mr. Siegfried.

651
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,040
Thank you, Mr. Sigma.

652
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Sigma nuts.

653
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,040
It's so good.

654
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,040
Actually, I was wondering,

655
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
did you guys ever go to Saucon with me?

656
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Saucon with you?

657
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,040
Yeah, Saucon.

658
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
I'm so happy I didn't fall.

659
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,040
I was about to say.

660
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
I was going to warn you guys.

661
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,040
I was like, no, let them fall, man.

662
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
Where's my phone?

663
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,040
At least they don't know about Madder Daddy's.

664
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
That's all I'm saying.

665
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
That's another one.

666
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,040
What is Madder Daddy's?

667
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,040
How about you, baby girl?

668
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,040
No, let's just say Madder Baby.

669
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
Would you rather eat

670
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,040
a baby ghoul or a Madder Baby?

671
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
What's Madder Baby's?

672
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
I know this one.

673
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
I don't know.

674
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,040
I know this one.

675
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,040
Did you already go?

676
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,040
Oh, wait.

677
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,040
We're all waiting for you.

678
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,040
I didn't know this will grow.

679
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,040
I was laughing too hard.

680
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,040
Thank you Grim by B.E.V.E.L.R.

681
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,040
for the 10 gifted membership.

682
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Thank you Grim by B.E.V.E.L.R.

683
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,040
Grim by B.E.V.E.L.R.

684
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Grim by B.E.V.E.L.R.

685
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,040
Grim by B.E.V.E.L.R.

686
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,040
Thank you.

687
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,040
Thank you.

688
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,040
So slow for me.

689
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,040
Are you okay?

690
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Why is my bowl not blue?

691
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,040
Why is it white?

692
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,040
Why?

693
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,040
You can't just ask that.

694
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,040
You can't ask why guys have blue bowls.

695
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Yeah.

696
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Where's the hole?

697
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
No, X is not the hole.

698
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
X is not the hole.

699
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
I don't think so.

700
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
Oh, that's not it.

701
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,040
Are they fake holes?

702
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
They might be fake holes.

703
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Fake holes, fake holes.

704
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
Fake holes, fake holes.

705
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,040
Can I clip through and see where this leads to?

706
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Why did he do it?

707
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
I don't know.

708
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
Surprise.

709
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,040
Are you kidding me? How did it not fall in?

710
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
I don't get that.

711
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
Why am I supposed to get there?

712
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
Don't tell him.

713
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,040
Don't tell her. She'll figure it out.

714
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,040
You got this, Trani.

715
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,040
You're so close.

716
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,040
You're so close, Trani.

717
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,040
Trani, you're so close.

718
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,040
You're so close.

719
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Wait, no, Trani, it's definitely the one behind you.

720
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
Information's on the way.

721
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Information's on the way.

722
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,040
Information's on the way.

723
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,040
It's the one you're right next to right now, Trani.

724
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,040
It's that one.

725
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,040
On the left, on the left.

726
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
On the left.

727
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
On the left.

728
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
You're right.

729
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,040
You're right.

730
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,040
You're right.

731
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
Oh

732
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,480
If I got that in hole in one I would have literally just like

733
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
So good

734
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,100
Can I stop bouncing for the love of God

735
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,320
Okay, that was far too hard

736
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,040
Where am I?

737
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,400
Okay, this one's hard. I know the power. I have the power

738
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,400

And then you get

00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,880
I forgot to use everyone's cold

751
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
Oh

00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,760
Wait, did somebody do what I did what did you do?

753
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,440
Nothing never mind

00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Avoid if we uh

00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,600
We never did it. Oh, I never did anything

Is there are you ready? This reminds me of what what what took place to see our our our lovely

00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Super bunny mandate

00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,960

00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,240
Oh, look, we are playing golf in my home. Let's find

766
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
Wow, and I'm doing fucking terrible

767
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,760
Is it more slippery because it's icy

768
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,200
You go on go on then story go on

769
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,400
Otherwise I'm gonna

00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,440
That's why you want to slip on the ace hole slip on these slides

771
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,320
I'm gonna achievement hit the ball

772
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,040
No one's special but actually special to me

773
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:09,480
She's very special too. AC has home advantage. What the heck?

777
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,560

00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:29,320
All right, you're your azure your mic's cotton. I think because you're so happy if I turn around and go back to the hole that we

781
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Three five hundred

782
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,360

You're gonna spawn golf and at least make your

878
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,360

Oh, you're gonna put that in my head. You're gonna regret that. I'll cut it in a word.

883
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,960
The music is so calm considering how chaotic we are communicating.

884
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,240
Then the pianist was like

885
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,720
Hmm

886
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,600
I'm blowing it. I'm blowing my lead

887
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,720
I hate I hate video game and I hate gaming and I hate

888
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,160
I didn't bring anyone in anything. All right, I'm innocent

889
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,840
I'm going backwards. No one is innocent

890
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,600
If everyone wants to pick I'll take responsibility for picking this one

891
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,840
I thought this was the main one apparently is golf it with friends, but I've never played golf it with friends

892
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,840
Guys, I literally

893
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:59,000
I originally thought it was golf with friends. Are we allowed to tell the story? Is there a?

894
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,640
Yeah

895
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:09,240
So Emmy hosts the lobby and we're all joining and is there is like it's just no letting me in

896
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:18,760
And we're like, okay, that's strange. Okay. Well, you know what? We've got enough time. We'll go buy golf with friends

897
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And she's like golf with friends

898
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:26,040
Yeah, go from friends because we're on golf right now. What? You never told me that

899
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:39,320
Who's it really funny funny? She's like, I'll need to use on the wrong game. It was so cute

900
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,040
I'm me. I'm

901
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,320

00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,800
I will wait I will wait patiently

903
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:03,320
How do we get in there? Oh wait never mind. Oh, I'll take it. I'll take it. I can't pull it one

904
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,720
Surely this is

905
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,040
Can I do that? I can't. I thought I did something

906
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:25,480
And I did nothing. You know what? See my ancestors big William Wallace. I call upon me. What the fuck are you doing?

907
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,720
Come on

908

One round of golf it before we have to pop off

00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,720
I'm already popping off

911
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,600
Where's the where's the hole?

912
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,040
Oh

913
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,600
I can't pronounce where

914
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,040
Someone did 650 is there? Can you see that?

915
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,600

916
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,480
I'm on the edge of

917
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,240

I don't know how I got Bastardo from Frosty. I'm gonna be honest

920
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,960
You're on a different one

921
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,920
That's the last level

922
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,760
Go down gently the hole is just below you

923
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,280

01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:44,640
I'm going to cry.

1435
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,640
Fuck.

1436
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:47,640
Did you almost hit me?

1437
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:50,640
Why does the current take you around the hole?

1438
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:51,640
I don't.

1439
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:52,640
Around the outside.

1440
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:53,640
Around the outside.

1441
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:54,640
No.

1442
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:56,640
Guess who's back?

1443
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:57,640
Who's dying?

1444
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:58,640
Me.

1445
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,640
I'm back again.

1446
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:01,640
Mercy's dying.

1447
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:03,640
Tell him, friend.

1448
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:05,640
I'm telepathy.

1449
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:06,640
Wait, hold on.

1450
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:07,640
Mercy's dying.

1451
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,640
Come on.

1452
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:09,640
Mercy's dying.

1453
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:10,640
Mercy's dying.

1454
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,640
Mercy's dying.

1455
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:13,640
For those of you who are loving women.

1456
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:16,640
I'm going to kill myself in Minecraft.

1457
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,640
Now hold on a minute.

1458
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,640
That's why you got hired.

1459
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:21,640
Alright.

1460
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:23,640
Now for anyone who's like,

1461
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:25,640
what on earth is the context of that?

1462
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:30,640
I may or may not have been chosen

1463
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:33,640
for her same amount of words

1464
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,640
that she used against someone

1465
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,640
that was rather inappropriate for most agencies.

1466
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:40,640
But you know,

1467
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,640
you know what we do a little bit differently here.

1468
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:44,640
What the heck is that?

1469
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:47,640
What the fuck is up, Kyle?

1470
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,640
Do it.

1471
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:50,640
What?

1472
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:53,640
Now step the fuck up, Kyle.

1473
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:54,640
Oh shit.

1474
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:55,640
I might never.

1475
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:56,640
Oh no.

1476
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:58,640
What the fuck pushed me?

1477
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:00,640
Where am I?

1478
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:01,640
Mercy's coming for blood.

1479
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:02,640
She's bringing me all the way to the beginning.

1480
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:04,640
About to murder.

1481
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:08,640
Wait, how are we supposed to get past the lantern?

1482
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:09,640
You got to jump it.

1483
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:12,640
You got to X games.

1484
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:14,640
Oh, you don't X game mode.

1485
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:16,640
I made it.

1486
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,640
This is far away.

1487
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:20,640
I didn't mean to hit.

1488
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,640
Look at this.

1489
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:24,640
Can I please?

1490
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,640
Oh my god.

1491
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,640
I'm on a date.

1492
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,640
I'm a bee.

1493
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:32,640
I'm a bee.

1494
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:34,640
Oh shit.

1495
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:36,640
No, please.

1496
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,640
This is not what I wanted.

1497
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,640
Mercy dying in the background.

1498
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,640
Is that Xeris Mike Fixenert?

1499
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:48,640
I think it is.

1500
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:50,640
Mike Fixenert.

1501
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,640
You take that filler off right now.

1502
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,640
I'm going to fart on it.

1503
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:56,640
I don't want to hear anything.

1504
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:58,640
You always start into farts.

1505
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:00,640
I'm sorry.

1506
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,640
Oh my god.

1507
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:04,640
You think you use this shit?

1508
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:06,640
You ain't even a fart.

1509
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:08,640
I'll be going home.

1510
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,640
Fucking fine.

1511
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:12,640
I don't know.

1512
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:14,640
I'll keep it a stack.

1513
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,640
There we go.

1514
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:18,640
A stack.

1515
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,640
Oh my god.

1516
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,640
Oh my god.

1517
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:28,640
I'm going to make a mess.

1518
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:30,640
Sudoku.

1519
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:32,640
Sudoku.

1520
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:34,640
Mercy ran out of time.

1521
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:36,640
Mercy ran out of time.

1522
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:38,640
I'm not last place.

1523
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:40,640
Let's go.

1524
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:42,640
Big W today.

1525
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:44,640
Oh sorry.

1526
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:46,640
Is that...

1527
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:48,640
I was losing it.

1528
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:50,640
I was losing it.

1529
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:52,640
Oh it is you.

1530
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:54,640
Mercy said Sudoku.

1531
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,640
Excuse me.

1532
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:06,640
What is that?

1533
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,640
Have I gone the wrong way?

1534
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:10,640
No I think you're in the right spot.

1535
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:14,640
We're supposed to hit that really hard I think.

1536
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:16,640
Oh come on.

1537
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:18,640
Are we supposed to hit that target?

1538
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:20,640
Where'd my hand go?

1539
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:22,640
I'll tell you.

1540
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,640
Holy shit.

1541
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:26,640
Don't fuck me.

1542
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:28,640
What the fuck?

1543
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,640
Sorry is there a...

1544
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,640
Wee.

1545
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:34,640
Guys where am I and how am I supposed to get there?

1546
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:38,640
I just fell off the face of the earth.

1547
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,640
This horse?

1548
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:42,640
I'm still falling.

1549
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:44,640
Where's the target?

1550
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:46,640
Where's the hole?

1551
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:48,640
Is it the fucking...

1552
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:50,640
The blue...

1553
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:52,640
The grill?

1554
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:54,640
It's the grill.

1555
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:56,640
It's the golden pot of blue supper.

1556
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:58,640
It's like in between...

1557
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:00,640
Do you see the...

1558
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,640
Oh my gosh.

1559
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:04,640
I think it's almost 100.

1560
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:06,640
Yeah it's the pot.

1561
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:08,640
Oh it's the pot.

1562
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:10,640
Oh it is the pot.

1563
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:12,640
That's weird.

1564
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:16,640
Oh my god.

1565
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:20,640
It's the cauldron looking thing.

1566
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,640
The cauldron? That's burner?

1567
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:24,640
Yeah I'm sure it has an actual name

1568
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:26,640
but I have no idea what to call it.

1569
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:30,640
I actually know what the function is.

1570
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:32,640
No I ran out of time.

1571
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,640
Holy shit.

1572
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:36,640
I forgot to use the other way again.

1573
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:38,640
I'm not the last place.

1574
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,640
That's crazy.

1575
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:42,640
Why appreciate it being here?

1576
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:44,640
You need to pick a game that you're good at.

1577
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:46,640
We can like roll out.

1578
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:50,640
It's so over.

1579
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:52,640
I don't know if we told you.

1580
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:54,640
When we first met, we played

1581
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:56,640
that party game.

1582
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:58,640
What is it called?

1583
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:00,640
Jackbox?

1584
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:02,640
Jackbox.

1585
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,640
And through Ace of Cull was lost again

1586
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,640
and I felt so bad.

1587
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:08,640
No more PTSD

1588
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:10,640
from being last place in the fucking game.

1589
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:12,640
And it wasn't fair

1590
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,640
because the questions were like

1591
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,640
English questions and they're really awkward.

1592
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:18,640
Words that's not everyday vocabulary.

1593
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,640
So it was like

1594
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,640
what is the plural of this word?

1595
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:24,640
What is a baby of this animal

1596
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:26,640
called? And it was like

1597
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:28,640
this is one fair on Ace.

1598
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:30,640
English isn't her first language.

1599
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:32,640
It's okay. I just have low IQ

1600
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:34,640
with spine.

1601
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:36,640
It makes me

1602
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,640
correct.

1603
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:40,640
You're not dumb sorry.

1604
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,640
You're not dumb sorry.

1605
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:44,640
He's not dying.

1606
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:46,640
Thank you.

1607
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:48,640
Thank you.

1608
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:50,640
Thank you.

1609
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:52,640
Thank you, Ray Kumar.

1610
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:54,640
Thank you Mr. Ray Kumar.

1611
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,640
Any Ray Kumar?

1612
01:41:56,640 --> 01:41:58,640
Any Ray Kumar's in here?

1613
01:41:58,640 --> 01:42:00,640
Any Ray's in here?

1614
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:02,640
Ray.

1615
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:04,640
Oh my god.

1616
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:06,640
You really are fucking higher

1617
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:08,640
in the delivery truck. What the fuck?

1618
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,640
Oh my god the next girl is the Peeler

1619
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:12,640
allegation.

1620
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:14,640
Wait what's the Peeler allegation?

1621
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:16,640
Wait what's the Peeler allegation?

1622
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:18,640
The four of you

1623
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:20,640
need or may not have

1624
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:22,640
peed on microphone.

1625
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:24,640
Azura hasn't and I'm next

1626
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,640
after her. I said

1627
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,640
Azura finishes it.

1628
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:30,640
I have to, I will finish it.

1629
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:32,640
Wait what?

1630
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:34,640
I have to look at her because we've all

1631
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:36,640
peed.

1632
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:38,640
Lemonade into the toilet.

1633
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:40,640
Yeah, yeah. Lemonade.

1634
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,640
We made lemonade.

1635
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:44,640
Yes.

1636
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:46,640
I don't know.

1637
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:48,640
I don't know.

1638
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:50,640
Azura's channel.

1639
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,640
Fuck.

1640
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:54,640
I've had worse things on my own channel.

1641
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:56,640
What the fuck?

1642
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:58,640
Oh shit.

1643
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:00,640
Why is it looking like shit everywhere?

1644
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:02,640
And what the fuck is the rocks?

1645
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:04,640
80 need, M.A. need,

1646
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:06,640
TB need and Mercy need.

1647
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:08,640
So Azura need is next, and then

1648
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:10,640
Strongly need. Strongly need just sounds like

1649
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:12,640
a grenade to me honestly.

1650
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,640
Strongly need.

1651
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:16,640
I'm just slew.

1652
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:18,640
Don't mind me.

1653
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:20,640
Cheeky Willie Pete over here.

1654
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:22,640
You gotta hit the middle of the center.

1655
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:24,640
I literally cannot get on this.

1656
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:26,640
Oh, I did it.

1657
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:30,640
I'm gonna go fall out.

1658
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:34,640
I can't seem to find the common.

1659
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:36,640
Let's go.

1660
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:38,640
Is everyone struggling to get on this spot?

1661
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:42,640
It's just you.

1662
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:44,640
It's too hard.

1663
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:46,640
It's just you.

1664
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:48,640
In what? Tabernac.

1665
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:50,640
There, I said it. Tabernac.

1666
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:52,640
Tabernac?

1667
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:54,640
Tabernac?

1668
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:56,640
We're going to the temple?

1669
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:58,640
I hate this.

1670
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:00,640
French Quebec is like

1671
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:02,640
Tabernac.

1672
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:04,640
Hey, where's the whole...

1673
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:06,640
Where did you get it from?

1674
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:08,640
Oh, no, I finished it.

1675
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:10,640
Cool.

1676
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:12,640
That's the whole...

1677
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:16,640
I'm punishing Imi and Mérici.

1678
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,640
Whenever Imi and Mérici misbehave,

1679
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:20,640
I punish them with French,

1680
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:22,640
but not just any kind of French,

1681
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:24,640
Scottish accent.

1682
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:26,640
Tabernac.

1683
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:28,640
Oh, Jean-Thuy.

1684
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:30,640
It'll be blue.

1685
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:32,640
Come stay, come sa.

1686
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:34,640
Oui.

1687
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:36,640
Other French, I know.

1688
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:38,640
Oh, Montere.

1689
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:40,640
There's no physics, there's no like

1690
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:42,640
Chatterpool on this damn stupid...

1691
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:44,640
Oh, je voudrais

1692
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:46,640
une peeler allocation.

1693
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:48,640
Je voudrais

1694
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,640
une peeler allocation.

1695
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:52,640
Je voudrais une peeler allocation.

1696
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:54,640
Je voudrais une peeler allocation.

1697
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:56,640
Je voudrais une peeler allocation.

1698
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:58,640
I would like a pill.

1699
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:00,640
This is a real punishment.

1700
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:02,640
Suspension isn't punishment around these parts.

1701
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:04,640
Not sure, this is a real punishment.

1702
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:06,640
Pillar again.

1703
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:08,640
We need...

1704
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:10,640
Not my internet.

1705
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:12,640
Oh, no, she's giving out...

1706
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,640
I heard her voice like...

1707
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:16,640
Help!

1708
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:18,640
I'm helping you, Mercy.

1709
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:20,640
I love you.

1710
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:22,640
I'm trying.

1711
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:24,640
Great, okay, let me...

1712
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:26,640
Oh, what?

1713
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:28,640
I see.

1714
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:30,640
You sound like a character

1715
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:32,640
from in any Sims game.

1716
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:34,640
Do a Scottish accent on a different language?

1717
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:36,640
I don't know.

1718
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:38,640
I don't know.

1719
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:40,640
I don't know.

1720
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:42,640
I don't know.

1721
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:44,640
She sounds cute.

1722
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:46,640
What are we saying?

1723
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,640
Is this similar?

1724
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:50,640
Why are you doing this?

1725
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:52,640
If you get stuck,

1726
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,640
you're supposed to hold R?

1727
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:56,640
Yeah.

1728
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:58,640
Did we stop the entire time?

1729
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:00,640
Wait, what?

1730
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:02,640
Oh, my God.

1731
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:04,640
You're stuck.

1732
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:06,640
You're stuck.

1733
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:08,640
Please.

1734
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:10,640
Please.

1735
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:12,640
I'm sorry.

1736
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:14,640
Oh, please.

1737
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:16,640
Please, for the love of God.

1738
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:18,640
Oh, no.

1739
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:20,640
You're supposed to hold 25 dollars.

1740
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:22,640
I'm not a fan.

1741
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:24,640
You're supposed to hold 10 dollars.

1742
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,640
I'm supposed to go.

1743
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:28,640
Wait, where am I supposed to go?

1744
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,640
I want to go this way just because...

1745
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:32,640
You're supposed to hold...

1746
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:34,640
You can't go that way.

1747
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:36,640
You can't get to know that we can't go that way.

1748
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:38,640
You cannot go that way.

1749
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,640
I'm sorry.

1750
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:42,640
I need to be sent to the asylum after this.

1751
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:44,640
I'm sorry.

1752
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:46,640
I like how Mercy is freaking bad.

1753
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:48,640
Oh, my God.

1754
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:50,640
AC had a story that came out,

1755
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:52,640
and it was her missing in a word,

1756
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,640
and it got so many views.

1757
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:56,640
Oh, yeah, I saw it.

1758
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:58,640
It got so many views, and I was like, damn AC,

1759
01:46:58,640 --> 01:47:00,640
keep messing up your English.

1760
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:02,640
Okay, let's go.

1761
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:04,640
No, my internet.

1762
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:06,640
Please, my internet.

1763
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:08,640
This is the best I've done.

1764
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,640
Oh, no.

1765
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:12,640
What?

1766
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:14,640
Is this an asylum?

1767
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:16,640
It's not asylum.

1768
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:18,640
It's asylum for it.

1769
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:20,640
Asylum?

1770
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:22,640
It's asylum.

1771
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:24,640
Asylum.

1772
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:26,640
Yes, asylum.

1773
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:28,640
Asylum.

1774
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:30,640
Carnival.

1775
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:32,640
Carnival.

1776
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:34,640
Carnival.

1777
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:36,640
It was such, it did so well.

1778
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:38,640
I was like, fuck you.

1779
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:40,640
I keep messing up your English

1780
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:42,640
while farming so hard.

1781
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:44,640
No.

1782
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:50,640
Oh, right. Don't do it too hard.

1783
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:52,640
Don't do it too hard up there.

1784
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:54,640
Too late.

1785
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:56,640
Oh, and I did it too gentle naturally.

1786
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:58,640
You know.

1787
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:00,640
Whoopsies.

1788
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,640
You got to hit it just right.

1789
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:04,640
I'm dying.

1790
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:06,640
Are you in game?

1791
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:08,640
Are you still in game?

1792
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:10,640
I'm still in game.

1793
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:12,640
My internet just keeps cutting out.

1794
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:14,640
The game is, the internet is like,

1795
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:16,640
I know what's important here.

1796
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:18,640
Make sure she can continue playing the game.

1797
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:20,640
Literally.

1798
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:22,640
What's the fun?

1799
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:24,640
Okay, there are bridges to go down,

1800
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:26,640
so you don't need to whack too hard

1801
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:28,640
to get to the bottom.

1802
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:30,640
I like to whack hard.

1803
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:32,640
Yeah, on my way.

1804
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:34,640
Hey!

1805
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:36,640
What the hell?

1806
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:38,640
It looks like, no.

1807
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:40,640
It's like, Amy had picked up Strani's ball.

1808
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:42,640
On my screen from the left.

1809
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:44,640
They're taking me away.

1810
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:46,640
They're taking me away.

1811
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:48,640
I had enough of me being in game.

1812
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:50,640
I'm kidding. I love you.

1813
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:52,640
I love you all, even though I hate the golf.

1814
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:54,640
Okay, I will do the same exact reaction

1815
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:56,640
in Golf with Friends.

1816
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:58,640
Come on.

1817
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:00,640
Nice.

1818
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:02,640
Nice.

1819
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:04,640
Nice.

1820
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,640
Nice.

1821
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:08,640
Nice.

1822
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,640
Hold on.

1823
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:12,640
Hold on.

1824
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:14,640
Okay, bye.

1825
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:16,640
We did it.

1826
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:18,640
We did it.

1827
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:20,640
Oh, we got to go up.

1828
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:22,640
Yeah, you go.

1829
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:24,640
Thank you.

1830
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:26,640
Oh, I made it.

1831
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:28,640
No, I didn't.

1832
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:30,640
Fuck my life.

1833
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:32,640
Damn it.

1834
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:34,640
Oh, not bad.

1835
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:36,640
Oh, please.

1836
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,640
Oh, my God, please.

1837
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:48,640
Okay, no.

1838
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:50,640
This is possible.

1839
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:52,640
You tapped for this.

1840
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:54,640
Oh, I don't know.

1841
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:56,640
Oh, don't mind if I do.

1842
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:58,640
Don't mind if I do.

1843
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:00,640
Let's get on the cam.

1844
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:02,640
Let's get on the cam.

1845
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:04,640
Let's see what's happening with the dogs.

1846
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:06,640
Let's get on the cam.

1847
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:08,640
What are we, Five Nights at Freddy's character?

1848
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,640
I'm fucking up the...

1849
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:12,640
No.

1850
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:14,640
I'm getting the action replay.

1851
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:16,640
What are you supposed to do?

1852
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:18,640
Oh, my fuck.

1853
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:20,640
Keep going that way.

1854
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:22,640
Are you serious, bro?

1855
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:24,640
I want to...

1856
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:26,640
I want to commit to Dooku and cry.

1857
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:28,640
Isn't that so Dooku?

1858
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:30,640
Yeah.

1859
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:32,640
Isn't that so Dooku?

1860
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:34,640
I think it's Dooku.

1861
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:36,640
It's Sapuku.

1862
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:38,640
Yeah, I know.

1863
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:40,640
That's the meme.

1864
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:42,640
That's the meme.

1865
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:44,640
I didn't even know what it was.

1866
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:46,640
I'm going to commit to Dooku.

1867
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:48,640
Dooku is a number game.

1868
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:50,640
Yeah, I know.

1869
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:52,640
Yes, yes, yes.

1870
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:54,640
It's my favorite game. I like the game.

1871
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:56,640
I'm really good at it.

1872
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:58,640
I'm great at Sapuku, though.

1873
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:00,640
What? Whoa.

1874
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:02,640
Hold on a minute.

1875
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:04,640
I'm going to commit to Dooku.

1876
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:06,640
Ten seconds.

1877
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:08,640
I'm just kidding.

1878
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:10,640
It doesn't matter.

1879
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:12,640
Do I sneeze?

1880
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,640
True.

1881
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:16,640
This will be my last trailer.

1882
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:18,640
I'm going to commit to Dooku.

1883
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:20,640
Could you...

1884
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:22,640
Oh, well, it brings a lot of publicity.

1885
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:24,640
I'm teasing.

1886
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:26,640
I'm teasing.

1887
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:28,640
You know what? Just for you, scrawny.

1888
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:30,640
No, I'm teasing.

1889
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:32,640
For anyone who takes that seriously.

1890
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:34,640
Relax.

1891
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:36,640
For the views?

1892
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:38,640
No, that's terrible.

1893
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:40,640
I'm doing it for the vine.

1894
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:42,640
I'm doing it for the vine.

1895
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:44,640
I'm going to do it for the vine.

1896
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,640
I'm going to do it for the vine.

1897
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:48,640
Where are we supposed to go?

1898
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:50,640
Oh, that way.

1899
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:52,640
You can't hit the gong.

1900
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:54,640
That's so rude.

1901
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:56,640
Oh, no, make sure you do it.

1902
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:58,640
Oh, right. No, it's fine.

1903
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:00,640
Oh, my God, I thought I didn't do it hard enough.

1904
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:02,640
You go in.

1905
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:04,640
That was amazing. I just saw that.

1906
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:06,640
I'm so sorry.

1907
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:08,640
Damn it.

1908
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:10,640
I'm sorry. My ping is better than yours.

1909
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:12,640
That's pretty accurate.

1910
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:14,640
What is my ping?

1911
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:16,640
What does it say?

1912
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,640
Yes!

1913
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:20,640
The best I ever did.

1914
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:22,640
That was a great trick shot.

1915
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,640
Oh, my God, Sakura.

1916
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:26,640
Kawaii-nee, Sakura-no.

1917
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:28,640
Well...

1918
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:30,640
I think my favorite is Ronnie

1919
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:32,640
just being really...

1920
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:34,640
really bad Japanese.

1921
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:36,640
I think I used to be able to say...

1922
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:38,640
Well, actually, right?

1923
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:40,640
This is really terrible, Lord.

1924
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:42,640
I can only say sentences from hentai,

1925
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:44,640
stuff like all that feels good

1926
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:46,640
in Japanese and like...

1927
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:48,640
It was an example.

1928
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,640
It was an example?

1929
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:52,640
Yeah, we need a taste.

1930
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:54,640
It's like taste test.

1931
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:56,640
Come on.

1932
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:58,640
Oh, my God!

1933
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:00,640
What the fuck is that?

1934
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:02,640
That's me.

1935
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:04,640
What do you mean by that?

1936
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:06,640
That's me.

1937
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:08,640
It sounds like you at all.

1938
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:10,640
It doesn't feel good.

1939
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:12,640
Come here.

1940
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:14,640
Oh, my God.

1941
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:16,640
Oh, my God.

1942
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:18,640
Wait, listen.

1943
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:20,640
I just had like a terrible thing

1944
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,640
pop in my head.

1945
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:24,640
Should I say it?

1946
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:26,640
Say it here.

1947
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:28,640
I was like...

1948
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:30,640
Imagine

1949
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:32,640
off-collab taste

1950
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:34,640
test stream where I just taste

1951
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:36,640
everyone's vagina.

1952
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:38,640
Oh, my God!

1953
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:40,640
Look.

1954
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:42,640
I can hear you.

1955
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:44,640
Taste a stream

1956
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:46,640
with my girls.

1957
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:48,640
Oh, my God.

1958
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:50,640
Turn out of test.

1959
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:54,640
That'd be a great stream.

1960
01:53:54,640 --> 01:53:56,640
Oh, my God.

1961
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:58,640
Oh, my God.

1962
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:00,640
Oh, man.

1963
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:02,640
I'm speechless.

1964
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:04,640
No, because I can't...

1965
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:06,640
I didn't know she was going to say that.

1966
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:08,640
Oh, my God.

1967
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:10,640
I'm down for anything, but...

1968
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:12,640
What the fuck?

1969
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:14,640
I'll be buying everyone yogurt

1970
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:16,640
and hydrating for no particular reason.

1971
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:18,640
I'll have some pineapple.

1972
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:20,640
I'm not going to argue.

1973
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,640
Oh, well, Mercy's sweet.

1974
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:28,640
I want to taste.

1975
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:30,640
Come on.

1976
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:32,640
Oh, my God.

1977
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:34,640
What the fuck?

1978
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:36,640
Oh, sweet.

1979
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:38,640
Surprise.

1980
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:40,640
Surprise.

1981
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:42,640
Surprise.

1982
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:44,640
Are you kidding me?

1983
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:46,640
How did you guys get up the stairs?

1984
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:48,640
How did you guys get up the stairs?

1985
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:50,640
The stairs take you up.

1986
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:52,640
Yeah.

1987
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:54,640
But how? I can't.

1988
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:56,640
Wait, there you go.

1989
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:58,640
Oh, no, she's rolling down the stairs.

1990
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:00,640
She's dead.

1991
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:02,640
Why?

1992
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:04,640
Why?

1993
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:06,640
They hit and patrolled,

1994
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:08,640
and they tried to catch me right in cocky...

1995
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:10,640
They hit and...

1996
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:12,640
They hit and...

1997
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:14,640
Oh, I'm not last play.

1998
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:16,640
Trying to catch me right in cocky...

1999
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:18,640
Oh, shit.

2000
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:20,640
Oh, shit.

2001
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:22,640
I could have gotten that.

2002
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:24,640
Oh, shit.

2003
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:26,640
This is like Harry Potter.

2004
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:28,640
Oh, shit.

2005
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:30,640
Can I, like, just fall down into this one?

2006
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:39,360
one. Where are we? Please, please, please. Oh, come on. Where do we go? What the fuck do we go now?

2007
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:46,640
Okay, finally, I got it. I got it. I got it. Oh, okay. Where the fuck? It's on the floor.

2008
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:54,240
That's the old hole, isn't it? Is it? So where's Spook? Oh, yes, 17. We're on for eight. I can't

2009
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:58,880
even find it, so I'm looking around. Where are they? I don't know where to go. Oh, I see it down.

2010
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:03,360
No, that's the... It's on the ceiling. It's on the ceiling.

2011
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:10,640
On the ceiling? Oh, yeah. Oh, it is. What the hell? You don't have to tell me twice.

2012
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:18,640
What the fuck about the ceiling? Why can't I just go all the way down here? I can't see anything, though.

2013
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:25,840
Just eat it. That's such bullshit. The hole is literally down there. No, it's on the ceiling.

2014
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:31,280
The old one. That's the old one. Oh, they're sitting on the wall. I'm fucking stupid. Never mind.

2015
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:38,480
I really thought I found out an amazing way to get it. I already tried that way.

2016
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:43,920
I can't fucking see shit. I'm not gonna lie. Gravity changes. If you look around,

2017
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:51,040
gravity changes when you go up. But how do you...? I don't know how to get up there. I'm sorry.

2018
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,040
I'm on the wall. I'm on the wall, but I don't know how to get up to the wall.

2019
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:59,280
Maryse, do you see where Shabia is? You need to go on that side and then eat yourself up with them.

2020
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,360
Oh, I see it. Yes, perfect. Eating.

2021
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:05,520
Well, I'm on the wall. What the fuck? Where am I?

2022
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:12,960
You're... You're... Oh, let's go. So good. Oh, we love it. Bye-bye.

2023
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:20,480
No, there's only one second. No, I wanted to do it. It looks fun. I wanted to finish.

2024
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:31,600
I was so close. Oh, my God. I got a plunger. I got a Joby again.

2025
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:41,200
You got another shit? I got the plunger. You got the shit, so...

2026
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:44,720
I got a pink hat. So who's got the fart?

2027
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:52,000
I love when they do that in rap, where they just go,

2028
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:56,400
country boy, I love you.

2029
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:04,320
Here. Right. I am going to say a grand spank and thank you for everyone for showing up for

2030
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:09,920
Azir's Dornathon and we got to have Vila praying together. I'm happy to see that no,

2031
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:13,760
there will not be a white text and black font coming out anything soon.

2032
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:15,680
I'm getting... I'm getting terminated, guys.

2033
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:21,440
Yeah, it's just great. It's great termination. I'm going to have someone skin walk with Chibi.

2034
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:26,400
Just warning, you know. I'm teasing. I'm teasing.

2035
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:28,480
I just come back next week with a different voice.

2036
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:33,600
Literally. I'm like, actually, nothing's different. Really, what are you talking about?

2037
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:39,280
This guy's like... Oh, my God. This was the 250 anonymous.

2038
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:43,520
Thank you. Anonymous. Anonymous. Anonymous. Anonymous. Anonymous.

2039
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:45,120
Thank you. I missed out. Anonymous.

2040
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:51,840
What is the agendination is myself and the other girlies are going to all redirect into

2041
01:58:51,840 --> 01:59:00,000
Azir's Dornathon. You all be forced to sit and watch. Azir has put so many plans into today's

2042
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:04,800
show. Please do. Even if you want to lurk in the shadows, you're more than welcome to.

2043
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:06,880
Yeah, definitely support Azirah today.

2044
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:10,160
Wait, where the fuck am I?

2045
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:12,000
On the main menu.

2046
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,040
Like close to my YouTube studio, like a dumbass.

2047
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:18,800
What the actual fuck?

2048
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:23,440
We all get redirected to Azirah and you're going to kiss her.

2049
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:25,120
And there are some...

2050
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:26,000
Can you read around it?

2051
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,920
Yes, there are some girls that are doing streams, but after their streams,

2052
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:32,720
anyway, they're going straight back into Azirah. So please don't worry.

2053
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:43,520
Okay, thank you so much everyone. I'm going to jump out of voice chat and wrap up my stream real

2054
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:47,120
quick. But thank you so much for playing. I was so hurt in a hauler.

2055
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:48,320
I had a lot of fun.

2056
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:57,760
Okay.

2057
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:08,080
Excuse me.

2058
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:10,800
Hi.

2059
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:13,120
Wait a minute. Can you hear me?

2060
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:15,280
I'm tired.

2061
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:20,720
I'm not used to streaming this early in the morning. It's not even morning anymore.

2062
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:21,760
It's afternoon.

2063
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:28,320
It's also hot as balls.

2064
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:33,120
But we're going to read into Azirah's stream. Let me just...

2065
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:35,200
Well, I don't know if it'll work because lately,

2066
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:40,160
lately raids haven't been working on YouTube.

2067
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:42,400
So I will also put the link for you.

2068
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:44,720
But thank you so much for coming.

2069
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:46,560
Even though it's 2 a.m. for you.

2070
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,960
Oh, damn. Thank you for watching.

2071
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:50,000
So late at night.

2072
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:53,840
You're going to take a nap before the next stream?

2073
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:58,160
No. I have some recording to do, so I won't be able to.

2074
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:00,880
But I will take a break. At least I'll try.

2075
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:07,680
If I don't find myself, you know, procrastinating the whole time while recording, then...

2076
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:11,680
I will try to take a break.

2077
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:33,600
Azirah's already at 8000? Oh, I'm so happy for her.

2078
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:35,600
I really hope she gets to move out.

2079
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:37,200
She really deserves to.

2080
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:44,960
She really, she really, she really, you know...

2081
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:50,160
I don't know how to say it. I'm like...

2082
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:53,840
Stupid brain drain. Let me frog blink.

2083
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:58,080
I can't even frog blink on purpose.

2084
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:05,840
Okay, whatever.

2085
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:11,360
I will copy and paste the link.

2086
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:15,040
Okay, I'll see you later today.

2087
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:29,440
4 hours. I did have to calculate that. That's embarrassing.

2088
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,000
I'll see you in 4 hours. Okay. Bye-bye, Pookie.
