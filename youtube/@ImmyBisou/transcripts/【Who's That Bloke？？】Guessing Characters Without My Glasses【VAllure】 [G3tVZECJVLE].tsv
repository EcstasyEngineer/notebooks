1895440	1897280	Useless. No.
1900880	1907280	Shonen character. Why are you guys calling her Useless? I feel like if it's a shonen character
1907280	1914320	in a ninja, then it must be Sakura if everyone's calling her Useless. Is that it?
1915280	1924240	Oh my god, you guys hate Sakura. You guys really hate her. Damn. It looks like a Demon
1924240	1933600	Slayer character to me. Oh, no, I see her now. Okay. Is that a monkey?

2111200	2123520	No, it's not the original Ice King. It's like, well, it is the original Ice King, but it's not the
2123520	2132240	the one we all know. It's like, it's like the one that Ice King got his crown for it from, I think.

5624560	5626400	god damn it, my thumb is getting stuck.
5627360	5634720	You're not blind? Guys, I'm so blind. The only reason I was able to guess some characters
5634720	5641600	is because, like, they're color palettes. I saw the color palettes, but if, like, stuff like XQC,
5641600	5648720	where he had like, um, things around him, like, when it's really muddled with other color palettes,
5648720	5654800	color palettes around them, it's like way harder. But yeah, thank you for all the praises.
5656560	5658560	So, hold on, let me go back here.
5666320	5668880	And, oh, chat has to catch up. And what the frick?

5696640	5700640	10 out of 10, thank you. Holy shit, chat is taking forever to catch up. Well,
5700640	5705680	since we've only been streaming for an hour, 35 minutes, I think for the last 30 minutes,
5705760	5713440	we're going to continue the confidence. I like the game, not, I like the game too much, not to
5713440	5724240	continue. Just for 30 minutes, just for 30 minutes. Okay. I like it too much. I literally,
5725440	5732560	I'm so, this game's got me. Okay. Just for 30, just, just a little bit, just a little,
5732880	5737920	just a little bit. I'm glad you like it. I'm glad I like it too. Okay.

5789520	5796880	I can't, I can't not. You're here with me right now, you know? Apparently approved by the devil
5796880	5803520	if the graffiti on the wall is anything to go by. You're here with me right now. We're here together.
5803520	5809840	It's basically like I have to. Oh, background music is so on. Thank you for telling me.

5836000	5841280	where they all gather around for some demons and treats, but they can't summon for shit. Absolutely
5841280	5847120	nothing showed up. Nothing showed up on this end either. I don't understand. It was a vision for sure.
5848960	5853760	Chapter one? Aren't we on chapter two? I thought we were on chapter two.
5858640	5864960	Can you pull chat down a bit? Oh, no. Oh, here. Here's what I can do.
5865920	5874240	I'll make it smaller for you. There we go. So now you can actually read what they say.
5881120	5885360	There you go. Yeah, we're on chapter two. Thank you for telling me that too.
5886560	5889840	Okay, um, I don't understand. It was a vision for sure. There was like...
5890800	5892400	You hear a car?
5896080	5902080	That's him. That's the guy who slid our throats in my dream. So the first guy wasn't him.
5906160	5912480	Yikes. He really just went in our room like that. You still doubted me? Where'd he get the key?
5912480	5915760	Should we just leave? We're supposed to vacate the room in the morning anyway.
5915760	5919520	Our stuff was still in there. What stuff we sold off most of the junkie we're hoarding?
5920000	5926000	I am not a hoarder. It's important stuff to me. Ten out of ten. Thank you.
5927440	5932640	And I can live without the trash and laundry. Well, like someone pointed out, we can't keep
5932640	5938720	wasting money buying new clothes. I am not risking my life getting in there to rescue our socks.
5938720	5947440	Well, I am. I like my socks. What's this game about? It's about me and my life story.
5950160	5955040	I like my socks. I put a lot of effort into finding cute socks.
5956720	5960560	It's my better bra. Actually, this new one sucks. I don't wear bras.
5961600	5965440	Still not interested. In fact, I'm somehow even less inclined now.
5966160	5969040	Scuff. You know nothing of my troubles.
5970880	5973120	Regardless, I think we have to kill that guy though.
5974160	5978560	This is no random burglary. He's specifically, he's specifically after us for whatever reason.
5979840	5981040	Yeah, it's a game about us.
5985600	5992080	No bra, just band-aids. It's actually tape. It's black tape. It's not, it's not band-aids.
5994480	5999840	I don't wear bras either. I am also a man. I am, I am also a man.
6002320	6008000	I'm kidding. Um, this is no random burglary. He's specifically after us for whatever reason.
6008000	6013040	Like somehow he tracked us down. So even if we run away now, we won't, won't he keep coming after us?
6015920	6023120	That's not wrong, but why is he still in the room? We're not even in there. Well, if I was him,
6023120	6030400	I'd figure, I'd figure we're getting, we're, ah, I'd figure, I'd figure, I'd figure we're out getting
6030400	6034240	food or something. So now he's probably waiting to kill us upon entry.
6034960	6038560	Unlikely, since he wants to go about this quietly.
6044880	6047600	I say one wrong thing and you guys are all up on me.
6053920	6058320	He's definitely hiding in that closet or something, waiting for us to go back to sleep.
6058320	6062640	Then he'll kill us in our sleep, just like in my vision, again. And you know this how?
6063360	6067440	I know because that's what I do. Duh. Plus he's using a knife. So there.
6068880	6074320	Listen, Andrew, just trust me. I thought about these things. You question, you question not why
6074320	6078880	she's thought about such things. Now, enough dilly dallying. Let's get in there and pretend we forgot
6078880	6087840	something. Minor, minor smelling air. Oh my God. That was not even on purpose. Okay, context.
6087920	6093840	I posted an audio on Twitter and instead of the word though, I typed out thought.
6095520	6099280	I meant to type out though, but instead I typed out thought and I
6100400	6105600	I quote, tweeted it saying like, I'm going to kill myself. I made a minor spelling error
6106800	6114160	in my horny post, but instead of spelling error, I wrote smelling error.
6114800	6118080	Thoughts and prayers.
6121600	6127440	Then we'll lure him somewhere less conspicuous. And then what? You have to ask? Sigh.
6128880	6130000	Let's go kill that guy.
6134000	6137440	Actually, he's still armed. They can take this guy. Yeah, she has a gun.
6138240	6143280	The hitman is nowhere to be seen. He's got to be in there, right? I didn't see him leave. Go in.
6144720	6149520	Leave this to me. This has got to be the stupidest thing we've done so far. No, let's go kill him.
6150400	6154480	Personally, I think shooting fireworks indoors was dumb, but hey, opinions,
6154480	6160160	which if I may add was also your idea. No, it wasn't. I was 12. You should have stopped me.
6160800	6166720	So should I talk you out of this one or no, shut up. Follow my lead. She's just like me.
6170560	6173120	I know, right? He's being such a little pussy. Let's just kill him.
6175120	6181360	You are Ashley. Yes, I am. That's fucking right. Go in the closet.
6183040	6191600	Oh gosh, Jolly Andrew. I just realized our impromptu night walk to the store has left me barged.
6192880	6199280	Is that so? Let us return to the gas stop at once. And since we want to be also quick about it,
6199280	6206880	let's take a shortcut through the park where we may frolic amongst the foliage shielded from sight.
6208880	6211280	I love the hitman music. Is this hitman music?
6214880	6223280	It's kind of loud for me. How's that sound? Huh? Terrific. Let's go.
6224000	6228880	Not so fast. Let me grab my things first. I just realized that I don't trust the staff here.
6230240	6238800	Given that you're about to roam around with a hitman around, would you like to save the game?
6240560	6242480	Should I save or should I not save?
6244960	6248640	Stop talking British. What do you mean? Do you want me to talk British?
6249680	6256240	Should I go British mode for the last bit? Save? All right. I'm going to save.
6259280	6267040	I'm going to write this save. Be a good girl and save. I'm always a good girl. All right, let's do it.
6268400	6273360	Well, congratulations. You have found the hitman and died, which is the best part.
6273920	6279200	There's more of the record. Andrew doesn't fare much better. When it comes to cutting people up,
6279200	6287680	I'm losing the accent. When it comes to cutting people up, the hitman whoops his amateur ass dead.
6288400	6292800	Though, given his romantic streak, he probably didn't want to live without you anyway.
6294240	6298880	Good. Good. He shouldn't. I mean, he shouldn't.
6301360	6305920	I bet you'd be happy about that if you weren't too fucking dead to feel anything.
6306560	6313360	The hitman wins and, ah yes, the world is much better off without you. However,
6313840	6319520	this is also anticlimactic. You get a free do over. All right, good thing I saved.
6322080	6328080	Yes, it is Emmy. It is Emmy. I know I'm really good at doing a British accent.
6328720	6336240	It's really hard to tell. It's really hard to tell that I'm not British.
6337200	6347600	You know, Shibi mentioned this earlier. But the other girls have told us that we sound the same.
6347600	6353760	And I thought of a good idea for like an April Fool's joke. Maybe Shibi should become me for
6353760	6359840	one day. And I should become Shibi, else you run Shibi's channel and you won't even be able to tell
6359920	6368160	the difference because we sound so similar, right? Right? Say yes. You like British Emmy?
6372080	6376880	Oh, good. Can we go? I didn't pick up my things yet. Come on, hurry up.
6378640	6381920	Okay, actually, where the fuck am I supposed to go? What am I supposed to do? Oh.
6384800	6388560	Got washed laundry. I'm trying to not talk in the accent anymore.
6390080	6397120	Indubitably. You'd be able to tell the difference? I don't know. I think if I practice, I might be
6397120	6402080	able to get it good. Pretty good. I just need to practice. Okay, genuinely, what am I supposed to
6402080	6409040	do? Can we go now? Holding the door open for me, are we? What a gentleman. Just letting in some
6409040	6414960	fresh air in the sounds of the city. Hurry up and get your things. I did. Okay, now what are we supposed
6415040	6423440	to do? Are we done? I would figure it out. I could always spot my cutie motel. I'm not sure.
6427120	6429680	I've never actually been told I sound like anyone ever.
6431280	6434800	Which is a good thing, I guess, because that means I sound, you know,
6438160	6441760	you know, original, I guess. Other than Shibi, I guess.
6445120	6447200	Head to the park? Is this the park?
6449920	6456400	Oh. Here we are. Is he coming after us or not? I don't know. I thought he would.
6456400	6460560	Let's pick a corner we can ambush him from. What corner? It's all bushes.
6461840	6463360	Um, I don't know behind a bush.
6466160	6469760	An abandoned shopping cart. Very classy.
6469760	6478320	You sound like Imi. I know. One of a kind. There's only one me. Oh my god, that reminds me.
6478320	6483680	I probably shouldn't bring up drama, but I want to talk about it. Did you guys see the Twitter,
6483680	6492080	the VTuber on Twitter, that like, here, the street will hide us nicely, allegedly, allegedly,
6492160	6498720	copied, like, Shiley Lee's design and also her voice.
6501280	6503920	I love drama too much not to talk about it.
6505760	6510080	What are we going to do if he just stays at the motel? Well, I guess we'll just leave then.
6510720	6515760	We'll grow eyes in the back of our heads and keep watching over our shoulders at all times.
6515760	6522960	Yeah, you saw it. You saw it. It wasn't that so crazy. I saw the VTuber before, like,
6522960	6526880	they kept getting in drama, like, little dramas here and there about,
6528400	6535440	about, like, copying Shiley Lee's design, but then I think when the voice clip came out, it was like,
6536240	6539040	way, way worse. It got bigger.
6542080	6544000	A YouTube video on that didn't watch it though.
6546560	6550880	I wonder how anyone even remotely familiar with the VTubing scene has not seen it.
6550880	6556400	I don't know. It depends how chronically online you are, especially on Twitter.
6558640	6561360	What a pain. I can't believe I'm actually hoping he'd show up now.
6561360	6566800	Good. Don't feel bad about murdering a murder. And on that note, not it.
6569840	6571360	You're making me do it again?
6572320	6576240	Yes. Dude only has a knife. You got this.
6577920	6578720	I hear footsteps.
6579280	6580800	Ashley, wait. I've never fired a gun.
6581360	6584160	Crap. I think he stopped. I can't hear anything anymore.
6584160	6586320	You can't ambush a killer that's waiting to ambush you.
6586880	6589120	And you can't very well start looking for him.
6590800	6592400	I'll let you use Twitter for art.
6592400	6595200	Well, maybe it still showed up on your, on your page.
6597120	6598240	Ashley, it's such a rat.
6598880	6602400	I've erased every girl from my mind except Emmy.
6604000	6606080	Perfect. That's exactly what I want.
6606080	6609360	Yeah. Why are you, why are you even saying that you saw this drama?
6609360	6611440	Huh? Are you looking at other girls on Twitter?
6614480	6615920	Why are you even admitting to me?
6617840	6618960	Okay. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
6620080	6622560	I like drama too much not to talk about it with you.
6624160	6625600	I use Twitter for art too.
6626400	6626900	Art.
6629440	6631280	Crap. Did we whisper too loudly?
6631280	6632240	Is he onto us?
6632240	6634400	Why do you stop to see what we're up to?
6635760	6637520	Bet this all looks suspicious as hell.
6638640	6640320	This doesn't look like anything.
6640320	6642720	He shouldn't even be able to see us from behind this.
6644560	6648000	You dirty boy. No, we can't do it here.
6648960	6653600	Tee hee. Off I go. Come and find me.
6654480	6655840	I don't want to.
6655840	6658640	Ashley, seriously. I don't, I don't know how this thing works.
6659360	6662560	No peeking. What is she, what is she doing?
6663920	6665520	Does your alt count as other girls?
6665520	6666720	No. Cause my alt is me.
6669280	6670800	I only checked Twitter to see me.
6670800	6672240	So I don't actually, oh my God.
6673360	6676960	Really? You actually, thank you.
6678960	6680880	You actually checked Twitter for me?
6681440	6682400	That's nice of you.
6684320	6688080	Um, uh-oh.
6690160	6691440	Oh, I'm back to being Andrew.
6691440	6692080	God damn it.
6694800	6696320	He doesn't know how to use a revolver.
6696320	6697600	What a noob.
6698480	6701600	Time has come to play hide and seek with the killer and Ashley.
6703280	6705680	Um, Ashley.
6706640	6708640	Not much else.
6712000	6713920	Nothing. Didn't she go this direction?
6718400	6719360	This way? Nothing.
6720240	6720480	Here?
6722320	6725200	An attempt or several have been made to please trash where it belongs.
6727600	6731200	They were so, they were all so close but couldn't quite stick the landing.
6732400	6733840	Ashley, you're scaring me.
6734720	6735200	Nothing.
6738400	6740160	There's nothing but trash in this bush.
6740160	6743200	People think they are so clever hiding their candy wrappers in beer cans.
6746800	6748800	What do you mean this isn't going to end well? Save?
6752560	6752960	Okay.
6755600	6757360	It looks like someone has gone through the bushes here.
6758720	6759200	Ashley.
6759920	6763760	Ah! No!
6764560	6765520	Uh, shoot!
6772880	6775920	I did it! I didn't even need to, I didn't even need to reload the game.
6779120	6779920	Uh-oh.
6779920	6783440	If you find him fire once, wait, I fired multiple times.
6786480	6787600	Ashley reclaimed her gun.
6787600	6790400	Oh, fuck! I fired multiple times. Is that bad?
6791040	6792560	Is it going to come back to haunt me?
6795440	6797920	Uh-oh. No more gun out of ammo.
6797920	6799360	Oh, shit.
6801360	6804560	I get, and I walked in and I started blasting him.
6805600	6806560	I panicked.
6806560	6807920	This thing is useless now.
6808720	6809920	No one knows it's empty.
6810640	6811360	I guess so.
6811360	6812880	Do they still bullets to just anyone?
6812880	6813840	Do you need a license?
6814800	6816880	Should I reload?
6817440	6818800	Should I reload?
6818800	6821120	Can I not get sex ending without reloading?
6822560	6823280	What do I do?
6825840	6826720	Reload the save.
6831680	6832560	Okay, I'll reload.
6833280	6834000	I have no idea.
6834000	6834720	Sorry, Ashley.
6834720	6838480	Although I wouldn't have wasted them at all if you hadn't made me shoot him.
6839200	6841040	Are we still playing the finger pointing game?
6841040	6842640	I thought we'd agree to leave that behind.
6843520	6845680	Let's just get out of here before someone sees us.
6845680	6847600	Oh yeah, and what the fuck was that?
6847600	6848240	What was what?
6849440	6851520	You running off out of the blue.
6851520	6854000	What? You need an excuse to start rummaging through the bushes.
6854640	6856800	Now that the hitman thought you were looking for me,
6856800	6858240	he sat there waiting to kill you.
6861520	6862320	That's your concern?
6862320	6863680	Of course it's my fucking concern.
6866320	6867920	No reload needed for that part.
6868800	6874560	So should I reload or should I not reload?
6877040	6878880	He didn't know you had a gun and would kill him.
6879520	6881440	Instead, I'm a bloody genius.
6882080	6884720	And what if he was in the bush you ran off to, huh?
6884720	6885600	Genius?
6885600	6886320	Well, he wasn't.
6887520	6888480	Quit your bitching.
6888480	6889600	It all worked out.
6889600	6891840	Clue me in the next time you have these genius ideas.
6893840	6895840	Yeah, that's literally why we started the game.
6896400	6897840	I'm getting that fucking ending.
6904800	6906400	Reload so you can do it again.
6906400	6907360	Okay, I'll reload.
6911200	6912240	All right, he was over here.
6913280	6914720	I'm only going to shoot him once.
6917360	6917680	Shoot.
6920800	6921360	I did it.
6922000	6922560	Nice work.
6922880	6926960	I have a few choice words to say to you,
6926960	6929600	but this is neither time nor the place.
6929600	6930400	Say them to me.
6930400	6931760	Degrade me for it.
6932320	6934560	Let's get going before someone comes to see what's up.
6937760	6939440	Those extra five bullets might come in handy.
6939440	6940080	Okay, thank you.
6940080	6941120	Yeah, first try, first try.
6941120	6941840	Got it first try.
6942640	6953840	Okay, quit your bitching.
6953840	6954560	It all worked out.
6955840	6956160	Okay.
6958480	6961200	Good girl, not unloading on someone else.
6962160	6964400	I would only unload it all on you.
6968400	6971680	Okay, let me see that.
6972640	6972960	Okay.
6978880	6980560	Okay, now where do I go?
6982000	6982800	Back to the hotel?
6988080	6989120	That's what I want to hear.
6991200	6992480	Oh, can we look in this car?
6993040	6993600	It's locked.
6994720	6998880	You know, it would have been pretty smart of me to steal his car keys before coming here.
6998960	7000400	You sure it sure would have.
7000400	7001360	I'm dumb as a stone.
7001360	7002240	What's your excuse?
7003920	7007120	I am at the mercy of thy whim, Starling sister.
7007120	7009280	Well, you should read my mind then, God damn.
7010160	7011520	My bad must be lack of sleep.
7011520	7013280	I'm sure he's still right where we left him.
7013840	7014160	All right.
7014160	7015280	Yeah, let's steal his car.
7015280	7016320	I didn't think about that.
7018000	7019200	Give me all two inches.
7019200	7020480	Shut your horn mouth.
7021120	7022560	It's bigger than two inches.
7022960	7030800	As long as no one saw us do it, who's going to have a clue it was us?
7031520	7033200	How this guy carries knives with him?
7033200	7034480	He's clearly a criminal.
7035600	7038320	Maybe the authorities will assume his friends got to him or something.
7039360	7040480	Do you prefer shoot or shoot?
7040480	7042800	Well, I prefer the right ending shoot.
7046240	7047200	Don't check the tree.
7049120	7050080	Ever the optimus.
7050960	7051520	Hmm.
7051520	7052000	Whatever.
7052000	7054640	Let's just go before someone comes to walk their dog or something.
7059200	7060480	He called me baby.
7062080	7063280	Ah, yeah, baby.
7063280	7065200	Leave those fingerprints all over the guy.
7065200	7066480	That's just great.
7066480	7068400	I'm sure you meant to say something else.
7068400	7072240	I guess it doesn't matter since you've never gotten your fingerprints taken.
7072240	7072720	Have you?
7073360	7073760	Yeah.
7074480	7075200	Motherfucker.
7075200	7075840	What for?
7075840	7077120	My driver's license.
7077120	7078080	Well, good thing it's me.
7078080	7078720	Manhandling.
7079680	7080320	Oh, my God.
7080320	7081920	I don't have my driver's license either.
7086240	7086800	Oh, my God.
7086800	7087520	That's so funny.
7088960	7089280	Okay.
7089280	7090160	Let's go get the car.
7095040	7096320	Is this driving simulator?
7096320	7100720	Am I going to have to know what?
7103040	7105840	Are we supposed to meditate mindlessly?
7106160	7107280	Sits on top of his car seat.
7108640	7109520	Amy doesn't drive?
7109520	7110320	No, I don't drive.
7110320	7111280	I don't know how to drive.
7115600	7117680	Driver's license are just a suggestion.
7117680	7118240	Exactly.
7118240	7119840	You don't have to drive.
7119840	7121280	Public transport is fine.
7121840	7124080	If you live in a city with good public transport, that is.
7127760	7129440	Newspaper cutouts of various incidents.
7129440	7131520	Most of them are about your old apartment,
7131520	7134160	both the tainted water and the fire situation.
7134240	7135840	There's also an article from last week
7135840	7137840	about some chemical leak in some other city.
7141200	7142080	I'll drive you around.
7142080	7142480	Thank you.
7142480	7144000	I'll be your passenger, princess.
7146080	7147360	You can drive without a license
7147360	7148400	as long as you don't get caught.
7148400	7150240	I'm going to get fucking caught.
7153520	7155520	Um, is that all we needed?
7156320	7157840	I can't go in the front seat, can I?
7159280	7159840	Oh, I can.
7161760	7162240	Oh, my God.
7162240	7163600	Look at him sitting on my lap.
7163600	7165840	All right, let's, let's see.
7165840	7168240	Oh, see if this guy has anything interesting in his car.
7168960	7170800	So much for not leaving fingerprints.
7170800	7172320	It's a little late to worry about that.
7172320	7174160	You've already touched the door, the handle, the wheel.
7175040	7176160	It's fine if it's me, right?
7179680	7180880	I fell in love with various papers
7180880	7182720	inside the most notable one reads,
7182720	7184080	Dear Mr. Washing Machine,
7184080	7186640	consider this a receipt for your cleaning service.
7188160	7190640	We're extremely grateful that you accepted
7190640	7192400	to clean our laundry for us.
7193760	7197600	Am I tall enough to drive?
7197600	7198880	I can use a booster seat.
7201120	7204240	Isn't Waymo like expending into more cities,
7204240	7207600	self-driving cars or no future thing anymore?
7207600	7209600	That sounds dangerous.
7210480	7211920	That sounds dangerous.
7214160	7216240	I don't think I should be in a self-driving car.
7220880	7222560	We're so confident in your services
7222560	7225200	that we will not be needing any progress reports.
7225200	7227360	In fact, please do not contact us
7227360	7229040	if anyone were to ask,
7229040	7230720	the less we know, the better.
7230720	7232960	As a bonus, we've included free samples
7232960	7234320	of all the new soda flavors
7234320	7235920	from our sister company, Happy Washing.
7237440	7238480	Are we the laundry?
7238480	7239200	Seems that way.
7240240	7241040	Yikes.
7241040	7242960	All right, let's get this motherfucker on the road.
7244960	7246160	Right, right.
7249840	7250560	I like driving.
7250560	7251680	It's common.
7251680	7254160	Driving is so freaking anxiety-inducing.
7254160	7255040	I hate driving.
7257360	7257680	Um.
7260560	7261680	Use my laugh instead.
7262720	7263840	That's dangerous, too.
7264560	7265840	I'm not breaking the law.
7269600	7270160	We should go.
7270800	7271680	Where to?
7271680	7272480	Could you elaborate?
7272480	7273840	We're off to somewhere, right?
7273840	7274880	Got the car and everything.
7275440	7277120	This isn't exactly the best situation
7277120	7279920	to go joy-riding in a stolen car.
7280560	7282640	We barely even have enough money to feed us.
7282640	7283120	Fine.
7283120	7284160	Let's go take-
7284160	7285280	Let's go take moms.
7286880	7289120	For fuck's sake, does everything I say
7289120	7290800	go in one ear and out the other?
7290800	7291280	Yes.
7292000	7294640	We're never going to talk to anyone
7294640	7296240	we know ever again, remember?
7296960	7298960	Did I say squad about talking to her?
7298960	7301280	Let's go rob the bitch, blind, and leave.
7302000	7303120	Amy, you're blushing, by the way.
7303120	7305280	I know I'm blushing because I'm playing this game.
7305920	7312720	Self-driving cars don't get tired, drunk, sleepy, or emotional?
7313600	7314560	Emotional?
7314560	7315440	Oh, I guess so.
7320080	7323120	What money do you think she has exactly?
7323120	7324400	I'm sure she's got something.
7324960	7327280	I thought she inherited some jewelry from grandma.
7327280	7329040	Oh yeah, but she can't sell those.
7329760	7331280	She can't, but I sure can!
7332000	7336320	Oh no, we still can't go over there.
7338240	7339520	I do love you.
7339520	7340320	Shut up.
7340320	7341200	I do love you.
7344320	7345760	I do feel bad for the father?
7345760	7346240	Why?
7354160	7354960	Andy is you.
7355600	7357840	Don't worry, Andy is you and I am Lele.
7357840	7362000	We've got pursuers or something.
7362000	7365040	Our parents' place is definitely something they've looked into.
7365040	7366560	Listen, Andy, wrong.
7367360	7370640	Andrew, the pursuer is taking a nap in the park right now.
7371440	7375600	Do you honestly think you're anywhere near important enough for someone to hire too?
7377360	7381280	If anything, it seems they assume that guy took care of us and that's that.
7382640	7384960	But the thing is I'd rather be overly cautious than dead.
7385680	7388560	Best we let her find out, what do you mean?
7392560	7394000	Wait, did I get something wrong?
7402640	7406880	Does the mom- was that spoilers?
7410800	7411520	We'll be quick.
7412480	7413920	Don't spoil her chat.
7414000	7415920	Wait, is that what you mean by she likes Andy?
7415920	7417520	Were you talking about someone else?
7418880	7419760	Okay, okay, okay.
7420960	7422320	So now you want to kill our parents?
7422320	7422880	Great.
7422880	7425680	You just said we can't talk to them anyways, so they might as well be dead.
7425680	7426320	Holy shit.
7427120	7428480	I'm way too tired for this.
7428480	7429680	Fine, we'll just rob them then.
7430240	7432400	Break in while they're at work, get some money and then get lost.
7433120	7433680	I'll take it.
7434800	7436640	Where do they live now anyways?
7438160	7440880	I know the place but I don't remember the exact address.
7440880	7442720	She actually told you the address?
7442720	7443040	Yeah.
7443600	7445760	Huh, the only thing she told me was to stop calling her.
7446640	7448000	She probably figured I'd tell you then.
7450160	7451840	I was talking about you like Andy.
7451840	7453600	Well, I like both of you.
7457600	7458720	Do forgive me, Ashley.
7458720	7461120	It didn't seem like relevant information at the time.
7461680	7462640	Whatever, just drive.
7463200	7464160	Wait, he's driving?
7465520	7466560	Will we be fine?
7466560	7468160	Just don't distract me with anything.
7469600	7470320	Okey-dokey.
7470320	7473840	Feet on the floor.
7480400	7482240	My god, it's not even your car.
7482240	7483520	Shut up and put your seatbelt on.
7484560	7485760	This sucks.
7485760	7486480	Yeah, it sucks.
7486480	7487200	No hurry up.
7488240	7492000	It'll be, it'll be goddamned if we get caught in that dead man's car.
7492000	7494400	Just because we got pulled over for some stupid shit.
7495200	7496160	He's a foot finishes?
7496160	7496880	Is he actually?
7497520	7499600	Was he gonna get distracted by her feet?
7499920	7502800	Huh, is that why he took them off?
7508880	7511120	I do like it when a girl puts her feet on the dash.
7511120	7512080	That's why I do it.
7514160	7514880	Make me then.
7515760	7518160	Do you or do you not want to go rob her parents?
7518720	7521920	I said, I said make me, Andy.
7522800	7524240	Okay, what do you want?
7524240	7527120	If it's to piss me off, then you're nailing it right now.
7527120	7528560	Oh come on, it's just a joke.
7529840	7531840	Ah!
7533360	7534880	I know it's not a joke.
7536800	7537760	Yeah, it is.
7537760	7538720	You get so mad.
7538720	7539520	It's just funny.
7541200	7544080	Like, I don't know you, Ashley.
7544080	7545200	You pulled this shit before.
7547840	7550400	I have no idea what you're talking about.
7550400	7554000	You'll keep going, Andy, Andy, until I get tired of correcting you.
7554000	7555200	Yes, I will!
7556160	7559680	And suddenly it's Andy and Lele and stupid bullshit all over again.
7560720	7561760	Way to read into it.
7561760	7563680	I was honestly just joking around.
7564960	7566800	Well then it's not funny and you're going to stop.
7570560	7572320	Nothing is funny to you anymore.
7578160	7579760	Well, are you going to drive or what?
7581120	7581840	Ashley is hot?
7581840	7582720	I know she is.
7582720	7588240	I just don't want us to get in trouble.
7589200	7591360	But you don't have to be such a hard ass about it.
7592240	7594880	I do, though, when you're such a dumbass about it.
7594880	7596560	You're a dumbass, too!
7596560	7597200	Just drive.
7598560	7599360	Are you angry?
7599360	7600160	I'm looking out for us.
7600160	7600720	Yes, I am!
7601520	7602560	Fucking drive, Andy!
7607200	7608080	Drive, Andrew.
7609840	7611600	And so he does, finally.
7611600	7614640	And you decide to give Andrew the silent treatment until you apologize.
7616960	7618000	I do that, too.
7620800	7621280	I do.
7621280	7622720	I love the angst, too.
7622720	7624640	I love it when they argue.
7624640	7626000	That's my favorite thing ever.
7628960	7631680	I do give people the silent treatment when I'm mad at them.
7632480	7634960	You're not sure what he needs to apologize for exactly,
7634960	7636400	but you won't forgive him until he does.
7636400	7639120	Because he was a little bitch to me.
7639600	7640640	And coming hot moment?
7640640	7641920	Yeah, gaslight and girlboss.
7643920	7645120	So while you wait for him to notice,
7645120	7646640	you're not talking to him, you fall asleep.
7648560	7649040	Uh-oh.
7649040	7650240	Another dream.
7654080	7655120	Amy, you're such a w-
7657120	7659120	What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
7660640	7661120	Huh?
7662640	7663840	What is that supposed to mean?
7664160	7665440	Call me a woman again, bitch.
7665440	7667200	I'll show you how big my dick is!
7671200	7673600	But at the same time, you feel wide awake.
7674960	7675760	Where am I?
7679360	7679840	Hmm?
7685600	7686080	Stop!
7688080	7688960	Oh, I'm sorry.
7688960	7689600	I'm sorry.
7689600	7690080	I'm sorry.
7690080	7690560	I'm sorry.
7690560	7691040	I'm sorry.
7691040	7691600	I'm sorry.
7691600	7692000	I'm sorry.
7692000	7692560	I'm sorry.
7692560	7693200	I'm sorry.
7693600	7695040	Oh, Arce.
7695040	7695920	Your soul.
7695920	7696400	Huh?
7696400	7696720	What?
7698080	7698800	Who's there?
7698800	7699440	Where are you?
7700560	7701200	Where am I?
7701200	7702720	Is this another vision or what?
7703360	7704240	There's no response.
7707200	7708240	Oh, this note.
7708240	7709520	I kinda wanna do it now.
7709520	7710000	Shut up!
7711200	7711600	Shut up!
7713680	7713920	Huh?
7715760	7716800	Where am I supposed to go?
7723520	7724160	I'm lost.
7725040	7726480	Oh, can I go in the top right?
7727040	7727920	I mean top left.
7731760	7732400	Upper right.
7733040	7734080	Pick the red flowers.
7741200	7742080	Can I not pick them?
7743680	7744640	I can't pick them.
7746080	7746800	On the bottom.
7751040	7751680	There's no...
7751680	7752160	I can't.
7754160	7754800	Ahem.
7758640	7760960	Red flowers make the path.
7760960	7762560	Pick red flowers to make path.
7764480	7766400	Is there other flowers that I'm not seeing?
7769200	7770640	Interact with the top right path.
7778960	7780160	And then I have to pick them.
7781840	7782160	Right?
7784000	7784720	There we go.
7786320	7787520	Ah, I'm so smart.
7787520	7787840	Okay.
7790400	7791040	There we go.
7794560	7795760	I hate mezes.
7797600	7799040	There's nothing to step on.
7799040	7800000	Okay, I can tell!
7800880	7802960	I know I'm blind, but I have my glasses on now.
7803920	7806320	Tarsal summoned you.
7806320	7807200	Can't tune in.
7807920	7808560	You're all muffled.
7808560	7809440	I can't hear anything.
7810000	7811520	The voice continues talking,
7811520	7813840	but you can't make heads or tails of it.
7820560	7822480	You scatter petals to keep going.
7824000	7824800	Okay, okay, okay.
7825520	7827200	I keep fucking blinking like a frog.
7828640	7829760	Why do I blink like that?
7831360	7833280	I promise I'm not blinking like that in real life.
7834080	7835840	I have to fart, but I'm not gonna do it.
7835840	7837680	Actually, no, I'll mute my mic to do it.
7842480	7844240	Okay, I did it.
7844240	7845120	Wait, I have to do it again.
7848880	7849760	No, it's not coming out.
7853040	7854960	Whatever, I should focus on getting out of here.
7858480	7859600	Oh shit, it's connected.
7861440	7862960	Are there other flowers?
7865040	7865680	My mute?
7867600	7869200	Because you've been a bad boy today,
7869200	7871600	so you don't deserve to hear any...
7871600	7872880	Oh, fuck, it's connected.
7882160	7882960	Fuck!
7882960	7883520	Where am I?
7883520	7884480	Everything looks the same.
7885120	7889280	Take these flowers and then make a path to go here.
7890640	7891280	Was I?
7892240	7893360	It's been 30 minutes.
7894880	7896800	Let me get to the hot scene.
7896800	7897920	Isn't the hot scene coming?
7900160	7901280	What are these?
7905600	7906080	Uh-oh.
7907840	7908320	Uh-oh.
7909440	7909920	Hello.
7911040	7912480	I see why I summoned you before, right?
7914800	7915760	I know, I mean.
7915760	7917120	I like to tease you a little bit.
7921120	7922480	No, I still love you.
7923600	7925120	You think I don't love you anymore?
7925120	7926560	Because I won't let you hear me fart.
7928320	7928880	Where am I?
7929280	7930720	In a dream, I called you here.
7930720	7931760	Well, can you wake me up then?
7931760	7933440	I was in the middle of something.
7933440	7934400	Doesn't even occur to you
7934400	7936960	that you should be afraid of this soul-stealing creature.
7937760	7939680	You got a long way into the hot scene?
7939680	7941680	What? I thought someone said hot scene incoming.
7943120	7943620	Hmm?
7949280	7951520	The hot part comes after you meet your parents.
7951520	7953120	Oh, man.
7954000	7954500	Um.
7958960	7960240	I'm- I'm literally-
7960240	7962000	I'm really debating on continuing.
7968080	7968960	No, I'm not going to do it.
7968960	7969520	I can't, I can't.
7969520	7970800	I don't want- I don't want to burn out.
7970800	7972400	I really- I- I can't.
7973680	7974160	Okay, wait.
7974160	7975440	Let me get out of this cut scene.
7977120	7978480	What if Andrew tries to talk to me?
7978480	7980400	He needs to know I'm deliberately ignoring him
7980400	7982160	instead of being in a coma or something.
7983360	7984800	The demon couldn't care less about
7984800	7986560	the lover's pet you're having with your brother.
7987120	7989280	It carries on as if you hadn't said a thing.
7989280	7990160	You used my gift.
7990880	7991600	What?
7991600	7992400	Was it useful?
7992400	7993600	Seeing the future?
7993600	7996000	Yes, the ticket- the trinket you gave me.
7996000	7997520	Um, yes, it's been very useful.
7997520	7998000	Thank you.
7999680	8001680	Then, do you want to see the future again?
8001680	8003680	Sure, I just have to keep holding on to it, right?
8004480	8005520	It is out of energy.
8007280	8008560	I'm able to recharge it.
8008560	8009760	Do you want to make a deal?
8009760	8010480	Of course you do.
8013120	8014720	Very nice scene incoming still- oh.
8016320	8017200	You're confusing me!
8018480	8020480	Never has it ever been a bad deal
8020480	8021680	to make deals with devils.
8022320	8023360	A bad idea.
8023360	8024480	Let's hear it then, what do you want?
8025120	8026240	Human souls.
8026240	8027440	Well, you're not getting mine,
8027440	8029520	so if that's- if that was it,
8029520	8031440	then not yours, tar soul.
8032480	8033840	Is that like an insult or something?
8036160	8036640	Who's then?
8036640	8037520	Just anybody's?
8038160	8040240	And why do you- why do you go-
8040240	8042080	why don't you go get some souls yourself?
8042640	8044640	I cannot enter the human realm unsummoned.
8045200	8046400	Like, you cannot enter here.
8047840	8050080	I am able to reach you only because of my talisman.
8050800	8052720	But even then, one can only interact
8052720	8054560	between realms through deals.
8054560	8055200	Do we have a deal?
8056640	8057760	I don't really get it,
8057760	8060000	but I can't say I'm all that interested either.
8061360	8063040	It's been just over 30 minutes, too.
8063040	8063680	I know.
8067440	8068400	There's a lot of good scenes,
8068400	8070400	but the one you want is a couple hours away.
8070400	8070960	The sex!
8072640	8076720	Listen, I really need to go back to my brother.
8076720	8077680	If I offer you a soul,
8077680	8080720	you'll make my talisman trinket dream thing work again, right?
8081280	8081920	Correct.
8081920	8082480	Sounds good.
8082480	8084480	I do have a soul or two in mind, actually,
8084480	8086480	but I'll see what Andrew has to say about it.
8088080	8089920	He's kinda- I don't know.
8089920	8090960	Something is shifting.
8090960	8091840	I don't really like it.
8093680	8097120	I probably wasn't the right entity to talk about this.
8097120	8097920	I will be waiting.
8098480	8099120	Right, all right.
8099120	8100000	I'll see what I can do.
8100000	8101040	So how do I wake up?
8101040	8103040	You wake up once your mind returns home.
8103040	8103760	Huh?
8103760	8104640	Farewell, Tarsoul.
8109040	8109440	Sags?
8110320	8110720	Gags?
8112000	8112640	Gay gags?
8120640	8122240	Okay, which direction should I go?
8122240	8123520	Up or- or upper left?
8126640	8127280	Say gags?
8127280	8127840	Gags?
8131840	8133200	Oh, I guess I can go both directions.
8135200	8135760	Left.
8135760	8136240	Okay.
8141440	8143120	I just want to get out of this demon place.
8149280	8149600	Um...
8153440	8155120	Oh, there's flowers in the top left.
8158240	8164800	I want to see Andrew before we end.
8164800	8166480	Okay, I'll try to get you to Andrew.
8167360	8167920	Here you go.
8169120	8172240	Okay, I'm guessing we're not supposed to go through that door.
8172240	8172640	Right.
8173840	8174320	Right.
8176720	8178000	Why was that a 4 out of 10?
8178000	8178640	That was good.
8178640	8180080	That was nice and loud and clear.
8181600	8182240	Which door?
8182800	8183760	The left one, right?
8187920	8190720	Yes, 9 out of 10, 9 out of 10, 9 out of 10.
8190720	8191680	The left one, right?
8202320	8203120	Let's do right.
8205200	8205840	You don't know?
8208720	8209920	Save and follow your heart.
8213280	8214480	Am I going through the right one?
8215760	8216480	No, why not?
8218160	8220400	God, I have to pee.
8220400	8221200	I'm going to hold it in.
8221200	8222640	I'm going to hold it in just for you.
8223200	8225440	Um, whatever this is, it looks unfinished.
8227600	8228000	Okay.
8235840	8236480	Oh, shit.
8240960	8241920	Let it out just for us.
8241920	8243600	I can't do it on my chair here.
8248240	8249600	Isn't that a fetish?
8250320	8250960	Pissing on you?
8252640	8255680	Um, I'm guessing they all have to look towards that thing, right?
8266160	8267040	Did I finish it?
8269440	8270320	Did I finish it?
8271360	8272800	Hold it as long as possible.
8273040	8278320	You're trying to, you're doing something to me here.
8283040	8283440	Okay.
8285360	8286400	Now it's complete.
8288480	8288960	Parcel.
8289920	8290160	Yes.
8291120	8292320	Well, hello again.
8292320	8294400	This is not the path to your home.
8294400	8296320	Oh, up here is my realm.
8296320	8297360	You must return to your own.
8298000	8300000	I thought I was already in the demon world.
8300000	8301600	This is the realm in between.
8301600	8302640	Entering the wrong well.
8302960	8303280	Well.
8306480	8307760	Trust the process.
8309200	8310400	Okay, I'll listen to you.
8314560	8316480	So it's fine as long as you are summoned.
8316480	8317840	Why not just summon me to your realm?
8317840	8320880	Why summon me here in this crap land instead?
8320880	8322480	Return home, Tarzel.
8322480	8323920	I'm expecting those souls.
8323920	8326880	You can't tell me there's another realm and not show it to me.
8327520	8328400	Return now.
8329680	8331520	Uh, leave me alone.
8332800	8333520	Where am I now?
8334160	8335200	This is so tiresome.
8335200	8337200	And I've had it up to here with these stupid flowers.
8339440	8339840	Die.
8340400	8340800	Die.
8341600	8342640	Yeah, fuck these flowers.
8342640	8343440	Fuck your flowers.
8343440	8344480	Fuck you and your flowers.
8344480	8345600	I'm going to break them all.
8345600	8346960	Yep, yep, yep, yep.
8346960	8348320	I'm going to stomp on them all.
8350160	8351360	Let me out of here.
8353280	8353760	Ah!
8356720	8358800	You'll hold it until we give you finish.
8363680	8365040	Yes, I know.
8367680	8368800	And he's not you.
8370320	8372640	Help, get me out of this shit hole.
8373440	8374480	Come on, wake me up.
8374480	8375840	It's not funny.
8375840	8377280	I'm trying, jackass.
8378880	8379520	Do something.
8379520	8380000	Help me.
8384480	8385200	Oh, thank god.
8387600	8389840	I was a hair away from taking you to the hospital.
8389840	8390240	Huh?
8390240	8390960	Why?
8390960	8392560	That would screw us over, wouldn't it?
8392960	8394960	You wouldn't wake up no matter what I did.
8394960	8396640	God, Ashley, don't scare me like that.
8398400	8400640	Ah, stop calling me a good girl.
8400640	8402240	I'm trying to focus on the cave.
8404160	8406560	My whole freaking body is like really freaking...
8408720	8409920	Stop, stop, stop, stop.
8409920	8410480	I can't, I can't.
8411200	8412880	Okay, mom and dad should be both...
8412880	8413040	Both...
8414560	8416720	Mom and dad should both be at work right now.
8417520	8420480	Whenever you're ready, I guess.
8420480	8424240	You're only being nice now because you treated me like shit last night.
8426240	8428640	I treated you the way you deserved to be treated.
8428640	8429840	No, you didn't!
8430720	8431840	Yeah, scratch that.
8432720	8434400	Considering you kept pushing me around all day,
8434400	8435680	I think I was pretty fucking lenient.
8437680	8438160	Piss.
8440320	8441840	I'm not feeling anything.
8441840	8442880	I'm not feeling anything.
8442880	8443840	I'm not feeling anything.
8443840	8444960	I'm not feeling anything.
8444960	8446080	I'm not feeling anything.
8452160	8453280	This episode is titled
8453280	8456320	Andrew and Ashley and the Home Sweet Home Invasion.
8458320	8460720	What kind of knockoff cash grab show is that?
8460720	8461680	I'm not interested.
8463280	8464720	Now you know how you make us feel?
8465360	8466080	I guess so.
8470240	8472720	Well, it's definitely all about cash grabbing.
8473520	8474640	Haha.
8474640	8476000	I mean, boo, no thank you.
8476880	8478320	No, I saw that you're into it.
8478320	8478800	Let's go.
8479680	8481040	No, it sucks.
8481840	8484240	But I'm so nice that I'll roll with it now.
8491280	8492480	Free parking, that's why.
