1015240	1021440	there we go oh there's another buddy toy here oh my god I have a story about this okay can I bring
1021440	1029080	this with me no when I was in kindergarten I used to they used to have dinosaur toys in
1029080	1035320	kindergarten and my favorite dinosaur toy was the long neck dinosaur toy and I played with it
1035320	1041800	all the time and that was the only dinosaur toy I played with and anytime you know any other kid
1041800	1050840	wanted the long neck one I wouldn't let them have it because it was my toy and then this one kid
1050840	1055400	wanted the long neck dinosaur toy but I didn't want to give it to him because it was my freaking
1055400	1059840	toy and so he didn't even want it because he wanted to play with it he just wanted it because
1059840	1071600	he knew I liked it have to you in the inventory oh okay he just wanted it because I liked it and he
1071600	1080320	wanted to like you know take it from me and so when I told him no he was like Amy's a bully he
1080320	1090760	started teasing me and he made a whole song of it buttons are there other buttons other than E
1090760	1100600	he made a whole song with lyrics about how I was a bully and he would sing it to me oh wait press
1100600	1119240	here okay puppy oh wait you're not puppy what's your name what's his name again um I forgot his
1119240	1127800	name was it catchy no right how dare they bully me huggy wuggy huggy wuggy yeah there you go huggy
1128000	1139280	look at me I'm right at the perfect height for him okay um then we come from there I feel like I
1139280	1143560	should have done I mean I guess I got a key from this room right maybe I shouldn't have made it maybe
1143560	1151680	there's nothing more to do here for the next place is there another place wait there was a door
1151680	1159960	that was locked wasn't there you have to have to fucking do this again okay I did it I'm doing so
1159960	1170680	well compared to other times how do I run okay this door I wish I was as tall as Hucky you
1170680	1176240	don't even need to be as tall as Hucky don't worry I'm short enough or you don't need to be as tall
1176640	1181880	um I'm guessing I have to put a cassette in there oh look at all the drawings on him oh
1181880	1193760	so good what is that I need to find a cassette in here don't they more bloody toys more drawings
1193760	1207320	my best friend oh my god literally me and my long neck dinosaur toy oh thank you mr. Ludwig wait is
1207320	1213920	that a reference to the actual streamer wait you didn't have to swing again there was a ramp oh yeah
1213920	1221640	you're right I could have just felt fell down if you're as tall as huggy the NBA would be the most
1221680	1232040	realistic true what does this one say for Elliott Ludwig wait I don't think it's actually the
1232040	1246080	streamer Ludwig is it it's probably a character I can't read that hey we made toys like this in
1246080	1252560	the first chapter okay give me the freaking cassette oh there's a note here no give me the
1252560	1262440	give me the cassette next next give me the cassette huh I'm not the cassette fuck give me the note
1262440	1288880	help me only chance experiment 814 notes this experiment utilized a live rat rat was fed
1288880	1295480	three portions daily for two weeks at the end of the two weeks the rat was killed are you fucking
1295480	1300280	kidding me they knew I was playing this game they wanted to torture me into a poppy flower and
1300280	1307360	preserve preservative gel mixture one week later an electric shock was applied to the rat
1307360	1315960	still in the gel and attempt to revive it the rat remained unresponsive of course it fucking
1315960	1323000	remained unresponsive you should have been it should have been me not the rat it should
1323000	1332640	have been me just take me don't take the rat analysis I still believe in the potential of
1332640	1338640	the poppy flower its unusual properties lead me to believe that the proper mixture and procedure
1338640	1345120	could have life-altering properties the poppy flower has for a long time carried heavy symbolism
1345120	1351120	and I don't believe that's for bro this guy's got terrible grammar and I don't believe that's
1351120	1361440	for no reason perhaps something larger than a rat would yield different results yeah I don't
1361440	1373920	think so let's watch this play can I zoom in somehow I feel like I'm too sure is the product
1373920	1380880	of a great man by the name of Elliot Ludwig divorced but a family man his site will always
1380880	1387600	set on bringing amazing toys to amazing children around the globe Ludwig spent countless hours
1387600	1393800	in the factory working overtime relentlessly in an attempt to continuously innovate and surprise
1393800	1401800	in the 1960s an unfortunate family death had pushed Ludwig down to his lowest but with so
1401800	1406880	much ambition he rose back up and continued to fulfill his vision for the playtime code
1406880	1412080	why do they censor his face Ludwig could never be content leaving a project unfinished but
1412080	1417680	just how did one man come to create such an astounding empire how did he manage to stay
1417680	1425000	determined even after suffering such a tragic loss it all began in the fateful year of 19
1426000	1436280	oh I guess that's all okay okay not the streamer Ludwig can we get up here I feel
1436280	1447400	like this is someplace I should look into okay maybe not he's probably disfigured oh you think
1447400	1456160	something happened to him when does William Afton come in wrong game wrong game I'm William Afton
1456160	1471080	maybe oh wait am I supposed to go in there no I'm not right I remember watching Markiplier
1471080	1476600	play chapter 2 and he streamed it and he refused to look at chat to help him and he got stuck for
1476600	1481720	like two fucking hours in one part of the game because he's too fucking stupid to like even I
1481720	1486520	knew what to do and I'm really stupid and I don't want that to happen to you guys I don't want

1899020	1904580	school they didn't let us have calculators during tests but then as soon as I got into high school
1904980	1909780	they always let us have a calculator like oh fuck they always let us have a calculator

3712820	3715820	Rejected item, orange robot toy, reasons for rejection.
3715820	3721820	After considering both options, management has decided to go with mommy long legs as playtime-coast stretch toy concept.
3721820	3724820	I like him personally.
3724820	3726820	Orange robot toy.
3726820	3729820	Ah!
3729820	3735820	I'm guessing there's something, did you notice, did you all notice the scream of Bunzo's death?
3735820	3743820	No, he died?
3743820	3753820	I can't handle all these praises and compliments, it's- it's, it's- I can't- I can't focus.
3753820	3756820	Oh god, that's terrifying.
3756820	3764820	Oh! Oh, um, oh, lever.
3764820	3769820	I'm guessing I'm supposed to power something here.
3769820	3774820	What am I supposed to power?
3784820	3789820	You weren't scared during any of that last mini-game, but got spooked by random collisions on the ground.
3789820	3794820	Well, because I was, you know, I was expecting it to be scary. It was the scary part of the game.
3794820	3798820	So obviously, you know, I'm locked in.
3798820	3803820	What am I supposed to do with this?
3803820	3809820	Stop praising me and help me with the game!
3809820	3814820	Oh.
3814820	3819820	Oh, look, there's a huggy.

3823820	3830820	The crane.
3830820	3835820	The crane. There was a crane around here. You're right, there was a crane.
3835820	3840820	Of course it's unexpected scares that get me.
3840820	3845820	Where is, oh here, the crane. So do I power the crane?
3845820	3850820	With this hand?
3850820	3855820	Is there like a button to power? Oh, there's another rejected one.
3855820	3859820	Kick me, Paul. Nobody likes it.
3859820	3864820	Laughed out of presentation.
3864820	3869820	He's just like me. I never told you. I want to tell you this story because it's really funny.
3869820	3873820	Okay.
3873820	3878820	Raise equals awkward in me.
3878820	3883820	The claw. Pull the crane over top of large objects to pick them up.
3883820	3888820	Oh.
3888820	3893820	Oh, this one. Pick this one up.
3893820	3898820	Pick it up. Do your job.
3898820	3903820	Pick it up. Oh, I have to, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
3903820	3908820	I have to, I have to, um, the, the, the electrocute, right?
3908820	3913820	Okay, let me tell you the story.
3913820	3918820	So when I was like in seventh grade, maybe I used to play this very,
3918820	3923820	I used to play this very role-playing game. It was called, um,
3923820	3929820	it was called Feral Heart. If anyone, if, if anyone knows that game,
3929820	3935820	I'm going to be super fucking surprised. It was not a popular game, but okay, pick it up.
3935820	3942820	Pick it up. And, um, I used to role-play in that like all the time.
3942820	3947820	Give it to me now. Give it to me.
3947820	3952820	Oh, suck my, huh?
3960820	3964820	Was I supposed to move it so that it fell underneath me?
3964820	3970820	No, it was, um, it was a very role-playing game, but you could only be a wolf or a lion,
3970820	3975820	and I was usually role-playing as a wolf. You can make your own wolf or lion character.
3975820	3980820	When I, you could like customize the lion to look like a cat more,
3980820	3989820	and a lot of people did that so that way they could, so that way they could play as, um, please fall.
3989820	3993820	Okay, thank you. A lot of people did that so they could play as warrior cats,
3993820	3996820	and I played a little bit as warrior cats too.
3996820	4004820	Um, like I would make my own warrior cats, I see, and then I would role-play as one,
4004820	4009820	but that's not the point of the story. The point of the story is to tell you there was this one,
4009820	4017820	there was this one part of the map where people would do something called like the mating circle.
4017820	4021820	It doesn't, it doesn't sound like what you think it is, okay?
4021820	4025820	Oh, there's another rejected one. Hold on.
4029820	4033820	Serpup's a lot. Extremely negative reception from various focus groups.
4033820	4036820	Whoever's idea this was should feel ashamed.
4041820	4046820	So there was this one part of the map where they would do some activity, some event, I guess,
4046820	4049820	called the mating circle.
4049820	4053820	Now the mating circle, what happens in the mating circle is not a gang bang, right?
4053820	4060820	It's not a gang bang. What happens is, you know, everyone kind of gets in a circle,
4060820	4070820	and there's like, um, there's like a, um, there's like a ringleader in the middle of the circle, right?
4070820	4072820	Work!
4073820	4075820	What?
4075820	4078820	It's not an orgy! I know it sounds like one.
4078820	4085820	There's like a ringleader in the middle of the circle, and what they do, what they would do is they would, um...
4091820	4093820	Is there another sign?
4096820	4098820	A scientific?
4098820	4100820	A scientific sign.
4109820	4115820	Is they would call your name, like your username, and you would walk to the middle of the circle and sit next to them, right?
4115820	4123820	And then, basically how it worked is anyone, any other wolf that was interested in you and wanted to be your mate
4123820	4135580	be their mate in between a ladder where junk is piled and um or if like multiple people went
4135580	4140700	into the circle with you then you could choose like which one you wanted to be your mate or you
4140700	4145500	could reject them both so the point of this story is to tell you that anytime it was my turn I would
4145500	4151980	sit in these circles for hours by the way absolute hours to wait until it was my turn to see if I
4152540	4159100	to see if I could catch a mate in this free role playing game and every single fucking time it was
4159100	4168380	my turn no one ever went into the circle to be my mate I only ever got one mate
4170300	4175340	and I don't remember how it happened I think it was just some I think it was a girl I think it was
4175340	4181740	a girl she just came up to me she was like wow she had like a male character and she was like wow
4181820	4188860	you're so you're so pretty and I was like oh is this my chance to get to get a mate finally
4191660	4197260	and then um we like role played for a little bit together and then she left me like I added her
4197260	4200860	as a friend on that account and I found her because you can have different characters on the same
4200860	4207180	account and I found her later again by accident because she never came to me or found me or talked
4207180	4212300	to me ever again I just found her by by accident and it was a girl like character and I was like oh
4212300	4218780	my god I've been fucking bamboozled I've been bamboozled I actually didn't find a mate
4222860	4229260	that's okay to me that's why you have big brother you're gonna heal my trauma from being rejected

5329200	5334720	Wait, maybe I should turn my sound up so I can hear them better. Was I close?
5338240	5340240	Was I close to being done?
5341680	5343680	You're tears are my nourishment
5347800	5353000	You're only using one hand it will be slow once the pace picks up use both hands to hit faster
5355560	5357560	Okay, let me
5358240	5360960	Let me try putting those sound up more. Maybe
5362880	5364880	Maybe that would help
5366080	5370000	I feel like the sounds in this game used to have strings attached to them
5370560	5375760	So they could be pulled back when they got too close to the children
5379200	5381200	Have fun
5388240	5390240	I
5397520	5399520	Should I
5404080	5410000	You can only do so much with money brightness is already up in the game is to start that's what I'm saying
5418240	5420240	I
5426000	5431920	Don't see any I don't see any should I put
5440400	5443640	Where is it it's coming from everywhere around me
5448240	5450240	I
5467520	5472480	Where is it I can't the sound is so confusing die
5478240	5481040	Oh

5543120	5545920	Jump off jump off that edge come over here
5548640	5556400	Wait, I want to see if putting my brightness lower might help because maybe maybe it's too light
5558720	5561760	Um, that's a bad idea
5569840	5577360	Don't cry I'm going to try to ignore this time. I just keep slowly looking around. Okay
5581280	5584560	I feel like the sound helps me see where it's coming from though
5584560	5586560	Oh
5586800	5588800	The gamma
5592800	5594800	That's not a thing here
5597760	5600080	There's no gamma is it vignette?
5606240	5608240	Don't stay in the middle if that doesn't help you
5608800	5610800	Okay
5613600	5617280	Camera is brightness remove bloom, okay
5620320	5622320	Sound can't help you it helps you
5623360	5625680	Sound can't help you see it helps you hear
5626080	5632240	I know but it helps it feel like I feel like it helps me tell which direction it's coming from if I can hear like
5633200	5635200	Which direction it is
5638240	5640240	So
5668240	5670240	So
5698960	5703200	I feel like I'm fucking hallucinating now
5710080	5713040	Like I feel like I'm genuinely hallucinating some of them
5717840	5719840	Like for real
5728240	5733120	Get away from me stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop

5935920	5938920	What's the rest of this stuff?
5939920	5940920	What's this for?
5940920	5942920	Did we ever use this?
5942920	5944920	This is part two.
5944920	5946920	Are we collecting this whole page?
5946920	5948920	Is this part one?
5948920	5952920	Mommy, one game left to play.
5953920	5954920	Sad.
5955920	5959920	Mommy was hoping you'd stay here forever.
5959920	5964920	Though, it's never too late to change your mind.
5965920	5967920	I don't care about you anymore.
5967920	5970920	I don't want to be with you anymore.
5970920	5971920	Leave me alone, Mommy.
5971920	5973920	You're not hot anymore.
5973920	5974920	I don't care.
5974920	5975920	I don't care what your voice sounds like.
5975920	5977920	I don't like it.
5978920	5981920	I wish Amy would scream at me like that.
5983920	5987920	If you frustrate me this much, I might do it.
5988920	5989920	Oh, fuck.
5995920	5997920	What do I do here?
5997920	6000920	I don't think I can jump back, can I?
6002920	6004920	Collectible here.
6007920	6009920	Collectible.
6018920	6022920	Look up.
6025920	6027920	Up there?
6032920	6034920	Do I have to go higher?
6035920	6036920	Oh.
6036920	6054920	Am I allowed to say that I'm going to KYKMSonYouTube.com?
6056920	6058920	Is that allowed?
6060920	6062920	How do I do this?
6063920	6064920	Okay.
6066920	6067920	No?
6077920	6078920	Die.
6084920	6086920	Only in Minecraft?
6093920	6099920	You'll make me sad if you say that.
6099920	6103920	Okay, I'm only going to do it in Minecraft.
6113920	6116920	Well, I guess I have to enter then.
6118920	6119920	Move!
6122920	6125920	Can you make me proud if you say that?
6125920	6127920	Well, which one is it?
6127920	6129920	Can I say it or not?
6137920	6138920	Uh-oh.
6138920	6140920	Uh-oh, was I supposed to go down there?
6140920	6141920	Wait, no, I feel like...
6141920	6142920	Rep collectible?
6142920	6143920	Oh, I'm sorry.
6146920	6147920	Too late.
6147920	6148920	Oops.
6148920	6149920	Okay.
6153920	6154920	I never mean it.
6154920	6156920	No, I would never mean it.
6156920	6157920	No.
6158920	6159920	YouTube, don't worry.
6159920	6160920	I don't actually mean it.
6162920	6163920	Oh, who's that?
6163920	6164920	Oh, it's...
6164920	6165920	Is that Huggy Wuggy?
6166920	6168920	Oh, I missed you.
6170920	6172920	That's not Huggy Wuggy.
6176920	6177920	Do it.
6177920	6178920	Pull it.
6178920	6179920	Yes.
6179920	6180920	Yes.
6180920	6182920	Oh, fuck off!
6187920	6188920	Is she nice?
6189920	6191920	Oh, she is nice.
6192920	6193920	Well, how nice of her.
6195920	6196920	Okay, hold on.
6196920	6198920	Let me put the sounds back down now.
6200920	6201920	Because now they're too loud.
6201920	6202920	Okay.
6204920	6205920	She's on our side?
6206920	6207920	That's good.
6208920	6209920	What is this?
6210920	6211920	Oh, it's so light.
6215920	6219920	I wish I had Optifine so I could zoom in like in Minecraft.
6228920	6230920	She's teasing me?
6230920	6231920	I know.
6231920	6233920	I could tell.
6234920	6235920	Uh-oh.
6235920	6237920	Is my arm going to get stuck there?
6240920	6241920	Okay.
6244920	6245920	Huh?
6245920	6246920	In here?
6248920	6249920	What a nice girl.
6249920	6250920	She's so nice.
6250920	6253920	She's the only one that's been nice to me this whole time.
6253920	6255920	Other than you two, I guess.
6257920	6259920	What am I supposed to do up here?
6261920	6263920	Galvanized square steel?
6271920	6272920	Drop.
6276920	6277920	Do I just go up here?
6279920	6280920	No.
6285920	6289920	So don't blame me if you don't wish to take the route if you know what I mean.
6290920	6291920	Um.
6294920	6295920	I don't know.
6295920	6296920	Should I?
6296920	6297920	Should I try?
6297920	6298920	Should I try?
6303920	6304920	What am I doing wrong?
6306920	6307920	Oh.
6309920	6310920	Oh, okay.
6310920	6312920	Was I supposed to take that with me?
6316920	6317920	Oh!
6317920	6318920	Yee!
6318920	6320920	I'm so surprised I didn't even need help for that one.
6321920	6322920	Okay.
6322920	6324920	And then I guess we just keep doing that, right?
6324920	6325920	Come closer.
6328920	6331920	You have to cross all the steel doors fast.
6332920	6333920	Got it, got it, got it.
6334920	6336920	Where do I get the...
6337920	6338920	Wait.
6339920	6340920	Wait.
6343920	6345920	Oh, do I just get it from the same place?
6345920	6346920	Okay.
6346920	6347920	Okay.
6347920	6349920	Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
6350920	6351920	Give it back!
6351920	6352920	No!
6353920	6354920	Give it back!
6354920	6355920	Wait.
6356920	6357920	Okay.
6360920	6361920	Okay.
6362920	6363920	Okay.
6364920	6365920	Okay.
6368920	6370920	Hello, sisters of genius.
6373920	6375920	Oh, I can just push it.
6376920	6377920	I am a genius.
6377920	6378920	I'm so smart for making it...
6379920	6380920	Heart corridor.
6380920	6382920	I'm so smart for making it all the way here.
6382920	6384920	All by myself with no help at all.
6385920	6386920	Okay.
6392920	6394920	Is that Jacksepticeye?
6395920	6396920	Is that Jacksepticeye?
6396920	6397920	Is that Jacksepticeye?
6397920	6398920	Is that Jacksepticeye?
6399920	6400920	Oh, not at all, sir.
6400920	6402920	That's what I'd like to hear.
6402920	6404920	So, Marcus,
6404920	6405920	what happened?
6406920	6407920	You see,
6407920	6409920	I was in home for the day,
6409920	6410920	when my grandparents realized
6410920	6412920	that if we bloody wallowed in the cafeteria again...
6412920	6414920	His accent is so funny.
6415920	6417920	And that's when I see it.
6418920	6419920	Jacksepticeye.
6419920	6420920	Jacksepticeye.
6421920	6422920	So, what did you do?
6422920	6423920	Where is that from again?
6423920	6424920	I forgot.
6424920	6425920	When I just thought I'd nab the bloody york
6425920	6426920	and be on me merry way.
6427920	6428920	Double the mornin', do ya?
6428920	6429920	Well, laddies.
6429920	6430920	I'm reaching for the thing.
6431920	6433920	And the mob handled Jolton at all.
6433920	6435920	Had me scared stiff.
6435920	6437920	I thought I was the only one there.
6437920	6438920	So,
6438920	6440920	I took a peek beneath the gate,
6440920	6442920	and some massive bloody thing
6442920	6444920	was duthering about the bloody hallway.
6445920	6446920	Thing?
6446920	6448920	You're sure it wasn't a person?
6448920	6449920	Clearly, and we can skip school
6449920	6451920	and take care of her 3k birthday.
6454920	6455920	Of course, yeah.
6455920	6456920	I don't need school anymore.
6456920	6458920	I'm obviously smart enough
6458920	6460920	to just graduate right now.
6460920	6461920	I haven't a bloody nausea murder-wise,
6461920	6462920	but I wasn't human.
6464920	6465920	It wasn't human.
6466920	6468920	Besides me, obviously.
6468920	6470920	Is it bad that I can't tell the difference
6470920	6472920	between a Scottish and an Irish accent?
6473920	6475920	I didn't know that Strowney was Scottish.
6475920	6477920	Had a Scottish accent.
6477920	6479920	I thought she had an Irish one,
6479920	6481920	because they sound the same to me.
6483920	6484920	Don't tell her I said that.
6493920	6495920	Poor Jacks, but they see.
6500920	6501920	Is that it?
6503920	6505920	Oh, how am I supposed to get there?
6510920	6512920	I can't tell between Strowney and fruit,
6512920	6513920	and one is from Scotland,
6513920	6515920	and the other is from North England.
6516920	6517920	I feel like I'd be able to tell
6517920	6518920	between Strowney and fruit.
6518920	6519920	That's easy.
6522920	6525920	No, don't tell Strowney I thought she had an Irish.
6526920	6528920	Don't tell her I said that.
6529920	6530920	Do I?
6533920	6534920	I have no...
6539920	6540920	Get one charge.
6541920	6542920	Open gate.
6542920	6543920	Get other charge.
6543920	6544920	Place it at the end.
6544920	6545920	Grab the other charge.
6547920	6551920	Okay, you're putting too much trust in me there.
6554920	6555920	Where is the charge?
6556920	6557920	Charge?
6558920	6559920	What did that do?
6562920	6563920	What did that do?
6563920	6564920	What did that do?
6564920	6565920	What did that do?
6565920	6566920	What did it do?
6566920	6567920	What did that do?
6570920	6572920	Do I need to get all of them?
6574920	6575920	But it won't last long enough.
6579920	6581920	Just don't tell her you thought she was English.
6581920	6583920	No, I knew she was in British,
6583920	6584920	like British, British, like,
6584920	6586920	like, like, hello, mate.
6589920	6590920	Good luck.
6597920	6598920	This one?
6606920	6608920	Let's fucking go.
6608920	6610920	I didn't think I'd be able to do that.
6610920	6612920	I was so confused when you said it in chat.
6612920	6614920	I was like, what the fuck do you mean
6614920	6616920	get one charge and get the other charge?
6616920	6618920	How many charges are we catching here?
6619920	6622920	We're gonna get so many charges we'll end up in jail.
6622920	6623920	Okay, go.
6624920	6625920	Go, break it.
6625920	6626920	Break it for me.
6626920	6627920	Yeah.
6630920	6631920	Say bye to Barry now?
6631920	6633920	Do you mean Jacksepticeye?
6633920	6635920	I can't say Jacksepticeye.
6637920	6638920	No.
6640920	6643920	Well, it was a sacrifice I am willing to make.
6643920	6644920	Oh, okay.
6644920	6645920	Wait a minute.
6646920	6647920	Wait a minute.
6647920	6648920	I recognize this place.
6650920	6652920	Isn't mommy gonna come up from there?
6653920	6654920	No, maybe not.
6654920	6655920	Okay, never.
6655920	6657920	I just recognize it because we've been in here before.
6657920	6658920	Okay.
6660920	6661920	We did it.
6661920	6662920	Did we do it?
6665920	6667920	Oh, the card's name is Barry.
6667920	6669920	Oh, Barry the card.
6669920	6671920	Oh, Barry the card.
6671920	6673920	Oh, Barry the card.
6673920	6674920	Oh.
6678920	6680920	That was whack-a-wacky.
6680920	6682920	Oh, I did it.
6683920	6685920	I fucking did it.
6701920	6703920	I hope you had a fun day at the game station.
6703920	6705920	No, I didn't.
6711920	6713920	I'll start you the last one.
6713920	6715920	Thank you for all the pets.
6715920	6717920	All the pets.
6717920	6719920	Did you know that pet in French means fart?
6720920	6722920	Which way do I pull it?
6723920	6724920	Which way does it go?
6726920	6727920	Open.
6732920	6735920	Go to the middle of the train station.
6739920	6740920	The train station.
6743920	6744920	And look up.
6747920	6748920	This?
6749920	6750920	Oh, yippee.
6751920	6752920	Yay, thank you for the collectible.
6752920	6754920	Okay, now how do I open this?
6762920	6764920	Why is it beeping?
6767920	6769920	What a funny language.
6769920	6771920	So when you sharded, you petted yourself?
6771920	6772920	No.
6772920	6773920	Sharded out?
6773920	6775920	Is there a word for sharded in French?
6775920	6777920	We didn't learn that in class.
6777920	6779920	They didn't teach us, like,
6779920	6781920	I think someone asked for like,
6781920	6783920	18 plus French like ASMR,
6783920	6785920	but it's like, do you think
6785920	6787920	they teach us how to dirty talking French?
6787920	6790920	Of course, I don't know how to dirty talking French.
6794920	6796920	I don't even know how to say cock in French.
6799920	6800920	Close.
6800920	6801920	Close it.
6801920	6803920	Come on, we're trying to be safe.
6803920	6804920	All the safety regulations.
6804920	6806920	I'm going to fall off the train if I don't close it.
6808920	6809920	Oh, wait.
6809920	6811920	I don't know how to say cock in French.
6811920	6813920	I don't know how to say cock in French.
6813920	6815920	I don't know how to say cock in French.
6815920	6816920	Oh, wait.
6821920	6823920	Isn't that all French is?
6823920	6825920	Just dirty talking?
6825920	6827920	The teacher has failed me.
6832920	6833920	Louie nerd.
6835920	6837920	Won't be teacher fat, aw.
6838920	6839920	Bracket.
6842920	6844920	There's many ways to say cock in French.
6845920	6846920	Louie nerd.
6846920	6847920	La baguette.
6848920	6850920	Or maybe even le cock
6850920	6852920	if you're feeling spicy.
6855920	6857920	What about a stream learning to do it?
6859920	6860920	Who's going to teach me?
6860920	6862920	There's no website that teaches you how to dirty talking French.
6862920	6863920	Is there?
6865920	6867920	They're always talking dirty.
6868920	6869920	Okay, okay, train code.
6869920	6870920	Okay.
6870920	6872920	This thing, that thing, that thing, that thing.
6872920	6873920	Okay.
6873920	6874920	Okay.
6874920	6875920	This thing.
6882920	6884920	Google translate?
6884920	6885920	That sounds like a bad idea.
6885920	6886920	Oh.
6890920	6891920	Oh, no.
6891920	6892920	Are you doing something wrong?
6892920	6893920	You're not done.
6893920	6894920	Oh.
6894920	6896920	Collab with someone who speaks French?
6896920	6897920	Mmm.
6897920	6898920	Wait.
6898920	6902920	I think one of the people who did a watch along with us speaks French, right?
6902920	6904920	Is it para something?
6904920	6906920	Is she like native French?
6909920	6910920	Do the code.
6910920	6911920	Do the code.
6911920	6912920	Do the code.
6912920	6913920	Do the code.
6913920	6914920	Do the code.
6914920	6915920	Do the code.
6915920	6916920	Do the code.
6916920	6917920	Do the code.
6917920	6918920	Do the code.
6919920	6921920	Do the code.
6921920	6923920	It's too early for the train.
6923920	6925920	Well, how do I get down here now?
6925920	6928920	Because isn't this the next game?
6928920	6929920	Paras...
6929920	6930920	Is it Parasite?
6930920	6931920	Parasite?
6931920	6935920	Yeah, maybe we can do a collab with her and she can teach me how to speak French.
6935920	6937920	She can teach me how to dirty talking French.
6937920	6939920	Why won't this open?
6939920	6942920	Stand to the right of the door and pull.
6949920	6951920	Is it opening?
6952920	6956920	She didn't understand you when you spoke French on stream?
6956920	6958920	Oh, bruh, really?
6959920	6960920	Damn.
6960920	6963920	Well, I speak like very, um...
6965920	6969920	I don't, like I speak very English French, like...
6969920	6972920	The kind of French I speak is like,
6972920	6977920	it's like the French of kids who just went to French school all their life,
6977920	6980920	like haven't ever been to Quebec or France or anything, you know?
6980920	6981920	Like...
6984920	6985920	She'd be happy to do that?
6985920	6987920	Oh my god, maybe I should reach out to her.
6990920	6992920	Oh, okay, where does this go?
6992920	6993920	Oh, there.
6995920	6997920	Well, now that's distracted me.
7008920	7011920	If Ella's Canadian French and she's real French, she won't understand it.
7011920	7012920	Well, no, my...
7012920	7015920	It should still be understandable, though.
7015920	7017920	It's just not a good accent.
7018920	7019920	That's all.
7019920	7021920	Like, it's still completely understandable.
7021920	7024920	Otherwise, all of my teachers wouldn't be able to understand me,
7024920	7029920	because I had, like, actual French teachers.
7030920	7031920	Oh, come on.
7038920	7039920	Down here?
7043920	7044920	Puzzle time, y'all.
7044920	7046920	Gotta use my brain again.
7047920	7048920	Unfortunately.
7049920	7050920	Now what?
7051920	7052920	Wait, now what?
7055920	7057920	Did I use the wrong hand?
7061920	7062920	Think?
7063920	7064920	Okay, I used the wrong hand.
7064920	7065920	Okay.
7065920	7066920	I got this.
7067920	7068920	Okay.
7068920	7069920	Fuck!
7086920	7089920	I'm gonna fucking kill myself in Minecraft!
7092920	7093920	Okay.
7096920	7097920	Oh, okay.
7104920	7105920	Please!
7105920	7112920	Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
7123920	7124920	Did I do it?
7125920	7132920	I did it, right?
7132920	7133920	Okay.
7133920	7134920	No.
7134920	7135920	We're alone.
7135920	7136920	Hm?
7136920	7137920	Hm?
7137920	7138920	Hm?
7138920	7139920	Hm?
7139920	7140920	Hm?
7140920	7141920	Hm?
7141920	7142920	Hm?
7142920	7143920	Hm?
7143920	7144920	Hm?
7144920	7145920	Hm?
7145920	7146920	Hm?
7146920	7147920	Hm?
7147920	7148920	Hm?
7148920	7149920	Hm?
7149920	7150920	Hm?
7150920	7151920	Hm?
7151920	7153920	Hm?
7153920	7154920	Mm-mm.
7154920	7157420	Oh my god, I'm playing-
7157420	7158420	Ah!
7158420	7158920	Ah!
7158920	7159920	Ah!
7159920	7160920	Ah!
7160920	7161920	Ah!
7161920	7162920	Ah!
7162920	7163920	Ah!
7163920	7164920	Ahh!
7164920	7165920	Ah!
7165920	7166920	Ahh!
7166920	7167920	Ahh!
7167920	7168920	Ahh!
7168920	7169920	Welcome to Statues.
7169920	7170920	Hi.
7170920	7172920	This advanced obstacle course is designed to test your physical endurance and strength.
7172920	7174920	The rules are simple.
7174920	7176920	The lights will turn off.
7176920	7180920	You can move through the obstacle course at this time.
7180920	7187880	However, when the lights turn on, you can look around but cannot move.
7187880	7192240	You may move again once the lights turn back off.
7192240	7195640	The lovable PJ Pugga-pillar will follow you.
7195640	7198960	If PJ reaches you, your test is over.
7198960	7202960	Oh my god, wait, no, no, no, no, no.
7202960	7204960	Good luck.
7204960	7209960	Wait, I'm not ready, I'm not ready.
7210000	7212000	Come on, I need to take a break.
7212000	7214000	I need to take a quick break.
7214000	7216000	I need to take a break.
7216000	7218000	I'm gonna go refill my water.
7218000	7220000	I'm gonna go pee.
7220000	7222000	I'll be right back, okay?
7222000	7224000	Oh my god.
7239960	7242000	You
7269960	7272000	You
7299960	7302000	You
7329960	7332000	You
7359960	7362000	You
7389960	7392000	You
7420000	7422000	You
7443000	7445000	Okay, I'm back.
7445000	7448000	You didn't hear me, shut up.
7448040	7451040	You didn't hear me, you didn't hear anything.
7457040	7459040	How was the piss? It was okay.
7459040	7461040	It was a normal piss.
7461040	7463040	I didn't look at the color.
7463040	7467040	Surprisingly, I actually didn't, um, bleed at all.
7467040	7470040	I didn't goo at all while I was scared.
7470040	7472040	That's really surprising.
7472080	7480080	Usually I do, especially when I sneeze.
7480080	7482080	What did she say?
7486080	7489080	I can't hear you, bitch, speak up.
7502080	7504080	Huh?
7515080	7518080	I didn't hear anything she said.
7518080	7520080	Oops.
7524080	7526080	Okay, now the sound is completely off.
7526080	7528080	What just happened?
7528080	7530080	Okay, there we go.
7530120	7532120	Got it.
7532120	7534120	What the f-
7534120	7536120	Wait, wait, wait.
7536120	7538120	How was it already?
7538120	7540120	What happened?
7540120	7542120	Do you bleed when you sneeze?
7542120	7544120	I do, I do, I do.
7551120	7553120	When the lights turn on, you have to stop.
7553120	7555120	You can't move during lights on.
7555120	7557120	Did you forget the rules?
7561080	7563080	Okay, okay.
7563080	7565080	You don't move in the light.
7565080	7567080	Okay, okay, okay.
7572080	7575080	Oh my god, please hold my hand, I'm scared.
7581080	7584080	Hold my sweaty fucking hand.
7584080	7590080	Oh, come on.
7592080	7594080	What are those circles?
7594080	7596080	Should I have grabbed the circles?
7596080	7598080	Should I have grabbed the circles?
7598080	7600080	Tell me right now, tell me right now.
7600080	7602080	Please tell me right now, should I grab them?
7602080	7604080	Do I grab them or do I do-
7606080	7608080	Are they for him?
7609080	7611080	Yes?
7614080	7616080	Shit, shit, what?
7616080	7618080	No, no, no, yes, no.
7630080	7632080	I can't see, I can't see.
7638080	7640080	How do I run? How do I run?
7640080	7642080	Which one is it? Which one is it?
7643080	7645080	I forgot, I forgot which button, I forgot which button.
7646080	7648080	Not the hard tube? What do you mean?
7648080	7650080	Stop pressing F, what the fuck is that?
7651080	7653080	You're scaring me right now.
7656080	7658080	Which direction do I go?
7661080	7663080	Stop, stop saying it's over, stop.
7669080	7671080	Go to the right when you get out of the tube?
7673080	7675080	Wait, I don't get it.
7684080	7686080	Choose hard path, shut up about hard path.
7686080	7689080	You gotta tell me where I have to go, otherwise I don't know.
7696080	7698080	I know it moves when the lights are on.
7699080	7702080	Should I have gone in a different direction?
7705080	7707080	Should I go like this?
7711080	7713080	What did I do wrong?
7713080	7715080	What did I do wrong that time?
7721080	7724080	Tubes after the slide have difficulties above them.
7725080	7728080	Go to your left in the tubes.
7730080	7732080	I did not fucking move.
7735080	7737080	Those hoops are optional?
7739080	7742080	I stopped talking when the lights are on.
7744080	7746080	Okay, hold on, I need to pause to reach out.
7755080	7757080	You let go of the bar so it counts as you're moving.
7757080	7760080	Oh, so I should hold on to the bars.
7761080	7763080	You don't have to hang on the hoops.
7763080	7765080	The pugga pillar is chasing after you.
7765080	7767080	I know, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7767080	7769080	When the lights are on, yeah.
7774080	7776080	But aren't the hoops faster?
7777080	7780080	So, Amy, what you need to do is run faster than the monster.
7780080	7782080	Okay, thanks.
7806080	7808080	Go!
7810080	7812080	Oh, fuck!
7812080	7814080	Okay, okay, okay.
7814080	7816080	Come on!
7824080	7826080	I can't do this.
7826080	7828080	I can't do this.
7828080	7830080	I can't do this.
7830080	7832080	I can't do this.
7832080	7834080	I can't do this.
7835080	7837080	I can't take it.
7837080	7838080	I can't take it.
7838080	7840080	Usually I love being told I can take it,
7840080	7842080	but this time I can't fucking take it.
7844080	7846080	You moved during lights on?
7846080	7851080	I'm trying so hard not to do that, but I...
7854080	7856080	I lost eye!
7858080	7860080	God damn it.
7865080	7867080	Where's the easy tube?
7867080	7869080	I will see it.
7873080	7875080	Where's the easy tube?
7875080	7877080	Oh, it's on the left?
7887080	7889080	Go!
7891080	7893080	There's the easy one.
7894080	7897080	Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
7897080	7899080	I can't see.
7910080	7912080	Have you played red like green light?
7913080	7916080	You're treating me like I'm actually delusional,
7916080	7918080	like I'm actually stupid.
7919080	7922080	Like I have negative IQ.
7925080	7928080	Oh, shut up, she fell for the easy path.
7931080	7933080	Go right?
7934080	7936080	What do you mean go right?
7943080	7945080	What do you mean go right?
7955080	7957080	The blinking window.
7958080	7960080	What about it, what about it? What do I do there?
7961080	7963080	What do I do with the blinking one, hold onto that?
7972080	7973080	Ahh!
7973080	7975080	Go, go, go, go.
7978080	7981080	Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, what do I do here?
7981080	7983080	What do I do here, what do I do here?
7983080	7984080	Help me!
7985880	7989080	What do I do? Is it gonna curl up? Is it gonna curl up? Is it gonna curl up?
7990080	7992080	Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!
7993080	7996080	You're safe? Which hole? There's no hole!
7998080	8001080	There's no hole. Oh, there's a hole! Get me in the hole!
8007080	8010080	Oh? Oh, okay.
8014080	8019080	Bitch, she talks so, so low. Is it music or sounds? I can't hear you, girl.
8027080	8029080	It's still chasing me.
8031080	8033080	Did I just fucking die of fall damage?
8044080	8046080	I thought I had to do all of that all over again. I got so scared.
8065080	8066080	What do I do here?
8074080	8079080	Mommy, mommy, mommy, shut up. Oh my god. I'm so tired of hearing mommy.
8079080	8082080	I never want to hear the word mommy ever again.
8082080	8084080	How do I get out of here?
8092080	8095080	Look up at the end of the- yeah. Have you tried looking up?
8099080	8100080	What?
8100080	8104080	I like how crazy her voice gets, though. I really like this voice.
8111080	8114080	Keep needing to put her like louder. She's so fucking quiet.
8115080	8116080	Where are you?
8129080	8130080	Up again?
8132080	8133080	Oh my god.
8138080	8141080	Okay, okay. I'm guessing I have to look up another time, too.
8144080	8145080	Oh, maybe go down here.
8148080	8150080	Look up simulator.
8155080	8157080	Look up stupid.
8166080	8168080	I am authorized. I am authorized.
8174080	8175080	She's about to turn.
8177080	8179080	Is my little sis winning? Fuck yeah, she is.
8180080	8182080	I'm winning so hard right now.
8183080	8184080	Right? Right?
8185080	8187080	Tell me I'm winning. Tell me I'm doing a really good job.
8188080	8190080	Do I turn this? No, okay.
8191080	8192080	Okay, now it's too loud.
8194080	8195080	Wait.
8197080	8199080	Oh, another cassette.
8199080	8201080	You know, some people think I'm really old.
8201080	8203080	I'm really old, no, no one fucking thinks I'm really old.
8203080	8206080	Some people think I'm really young, but I was actually...
8207080	8213080	I was actually listening and watching cassettes when I was younger.
8213080	8214080	A lot.
8216080	8219080	I had a whole cassette player and I had a whole collection of cassettes,
8219080	8221080	and I would watch cassettes.
8221080	8223080	I'm not that young.
8224080	8226080	You're doing a really good job.
8228080	8232080	I'm actually secretly a boomer, and no one will ever know.
8234080	8238080	Hag! No, no, I didn't tell you that so you couldn't call me a hag.
8239080	8240080	Give it to me.
8242080	8244080	Rotate top degree. Oh, wait.
8245080	8246080	What?
8249080	8250080	Oh.
8255080	8257080	There's a tape. Where is the tape?
8259080	8261080	Did I miss it? Probably. Is there somebody here?
8264080	8266080	200-year-old.
8271080	8273080	Oh, wait, no, where's the tape? Yeah.
8277080	8279080	There's nothing back here.
8279080	8281080	Oh, that's where we came from.
8286080	8288080	Literally legal.
8294080	8297080	How could you miss? It was three feet in front of you.
8297080	8299080	What was in front of me?
8300080	8301080	The tape?
8303080	8305080	There's no tape.
8306080	8307080	It was right...
8308080	8310080	Where? Here?
8311080	8312080	Oh!
8313080	8314080	Can I jump?
8315080	8317080	Oh, no.
8318080	8322080	Yeah, I was too distracted thinking about hags and how sexy...
8324080	8327080	Oh, okay. I was trying to read it upside down.
8334080	8335080	Okay.
8336080	8337080	I see.
8339080	8340080	No, no, no.
8341080	8342080	Wait, no.
8342080	8344080	Wait, there's a top and a bottom?
8346080	8347080	This one.
8347080	8349080	No! Oh, that's the top.
8349080	8351080	Can I go the other direction?
8351080	8353080	Can I go the other direction?
8354080	8355080	Maybe like that?
8358080	8359080	Wait, what?
8360080	8361080	I don't get it!
8376080	8379080	No matter how old you are for me, you're eternally 19?
8379080	8381080	Why 19? That's such a random age.
8388080	8389080	Toy scanner.
8389080	8390080	Scan this toy.
8392080	8394080	Scan my dick.
8394080	8396080	I'm guessing I can't jump.
8399080	8401080	Can I? Should I try again?
8402080	8403080	19?
8403080	8404080	Haggler!
8405080	8407080	Watch out, we got an old lady over here.
8407080	8410080	She might trip and fall and hurt her back at 19 years old.
8419080	8420080	Can I grab it with my hands?
8422080	8423080	Sometimes...
8423080	8425080	Wait, so if I only rotate the top,
8426080	8428080	the bottom doesn't rotate, right?
8429080	8430080	Is that it?
8430080	8432080	But if I rotate the bottom,
8433080	8435080	then they both rotate, right?
8438080	8439080	Right?
8454080	8456080	Oh fuck you!
8457080	8459080	These bitches know what they're doing.
8460080	8462080	Wait, oh, oh wait.
8463080	8464080	Wait, wait, what?
8465080	8467080	No, I don't think I... I don't...
8467080	8468080	I don't think I got it.
8470080	8471080	So I need...
8479080	8480080	What?
8482080	8483080	Oh.
8487080	8489080	This fucking game is playing with my head.
8489080	8491080	But how am I supposed to get to it?
8496080	8498080	How am I supposed to get to it?
8506080	8509080	This is your first time seeing someone get stuck.
8510080	8513080	We'll be taking a lot of each other's first times.
8513080	8515080	Just keep trying.
8517080	8519080	Run while your hand is on it?
8519080	8520080	What do you mean?
8525080	8526080	Rotate more.
8543080	8545080	You gotta flip it truly.
8545080	8548080	You gotta use more specific language.
8560080	8563080	Step one, stand on blue platform in the middle.
8565080	8567080	Oh wait, I can't even get to it, hold on.
8567080	8569080	Okay, I'm in the middle.
8569080	8571080	I'm in the middle.
8571080	8572080	Can I just...
8598080	8601080	You know what, I don't even deserve that.
8604080	8607080	I don't deserve to see that fucking cassette.
8612080	8614080	I'm too fucking stupid.
8614080	8616080	Oops, am I tracking?
8616080	8618080	I'm too fucking stupid.
8618080	8620080	I don't deserve to even look at it.
8623080	8626080	I don't know how I got this far in life.
8626080	8628080	How haven't I died yet?
8632080	8634080	Watch me not be able to get it anymore.
8636080	8638080	Oops, I think I did it.
8650080	8652080	I'm trying to finish this fucking chapter,
8652080	8655080	but it's really taken my soul with it.
8656080	8657080	Play.
8658080	8660080	This better be fucking worth it.
8663080	8665080	Should I know this guy?
8665080	8667080	Is he also like a popular gamer?
8685080	8688080	It's huge, I'm telling you. What's your favorite color? Blue? I bet it's blue, right? It's blue?
8688080	8689080	It's green.
8690080	8693080	Okay, well, your special case, most people would say blue.
8693080	8696080	But seriously, marketing is not as easy as you think.
8696080	8698080	I make it look easy.
8698080	8703080	If there's anything playtime coach should be known for, it's not toys, it's marketing.
8707080	8709080	Thank you.
8712080	8714080	Your special case?
8715080	8717080	A special nutcase.
8717080	8719080	What do I do now?
8721080	8724080	I'm guessing I go to one of the places.
8736080	8738080	What the hell is the E sound?
8739080	8741080	Benjamin?
8742080	8745080	Am I supposed to, is Benjamin like a YouTuber?
8746080	8748080	Go to left first.
8750080	8751080	Wait.
8751080	8752080	Wait.
8752080	8754080	Oops, wait, no.
8757080	8759080	Aw, fuck.
8761080	8764080	Now I'm going to have to figure out how to get to the left one.
8764080	8768080	No, I wasn't listening to the video, was I supposed to? Was it telling me something important?
8771080	8773080	Hitting that Benjamin to blinker tint.
8773080	8778080	What the fuck kind of zoomer talk are you, are you saying?
8778080	8779080	Oh!
8780080	8781080	What?
8781080	8782080	Oh.
8782080	8785080	Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, but...
8785080	8786080	Oh!
8786080	8787080	What?
8787080	8788080	Oh.
8788080	8791080	Meow, meow, meow, meow, but...
8805080	8806080	Wait, what?
8806080	8807080	Oh!
8808080	8809080	Can you meow like her?
8809080	8810080	What did she say?
8810080	8812080	Meow, meow, meow, meow.
8813080	8814080	Button.
8815080	8816080	Oh.
8821080	8825080	When you elevate yourself, go all the way to the top and grab the button.
8825080	8826080	Oh, I did it!
8836080	8837080	Did something happen?
8838080	8840080	Oh, this one's to go down.
8841080	8842080	Ugh.
8842080	8843080	Okay.
8843080	8844080	Oh.
8845080	8846080	Is there anything else?
8846080	8847080	Am I missing something?
8847080	8848080	Should I press the other buttons?
8854080	8856080	Aw, I think I'm doing something wrong.
8857080	8860080	I'll never understand why viewers urge humans to get collectibles.
8860080	8862080	They'll never worry or care about.
8863080	8864080	I don't know, it's fun.
8865080	8869080	It's a nice challenge, even though this entire fucking game is hella challenging for me.
8869080	8870080	Okay.
8873080	8874080	So...
8882080	8883080	I feel like...
8885080	8890080	I feel like I should be sending these arrows a specific direction.
8890080	8891080	Can I go up here?
8893080	8894080	You're doing it correctly?
8896080	8898080	Which way are they supposed to go?
8900080	8903080	We direct the cat to a sand.
8915080	8918080	You should be sending them towards you.
8921080	8922080	Where is me?
8922080	8923080	Where am I?
8923080	8924080	Which cat?
8925080	8926080	Are those cats?
8927080	8928080	Those look like monkeys.
8932080	8933080	How late is it?
8935080	8939080	I tell you how late it is, you're going to make fun of me for yawning.
8939080	8940080	Those are the bunnies.
8941080	8942080	There's no cats here.
8947080	8948080	Okay.
8950080	8951080	Okay.
8952080	8953080	Okay.
8954080	8957080	Okay, so I have to make them come towards me.
8958080	8961080	So, if they go that direction...
8962080	8963080	They go there.
8965080	8966080	Oh, but then they fall.
8968080	8969080	I won't, I promise.
8970080	8971080	Thank you, promise.
8973080	8975080	What do you hear inside me?
8978080	8980080	What do you hear inside me?
8980080	8981080	I don't know.
8982080	8983080	Do you want to find out?
8985080	8987080	Go up and hit the next one.
8988080	8989080	Push the blue button.
8990080	8991080	Oh, can I reset?
9001080	9002080	Yeah, everyone was thinking it.
9002080	9003080	He just said it.
9003080	9004080	He said it for everyone.
9005080	9006080	Oh, did I do it?
9007080	9008080	Oh, no, I didn't.
9011080	9012080	There we go.
9012080	9013080	Hello.
9014080	9015080	Now what?
9019080	9021080	I'm squishy and warm on the inside.
9025080	9026080	Okay.
9028080	9029080	Okay.
9030080	9031080	Okay.
9031080	9032080	Okay.
9038080	9039080	Is that all I needed?
9042080	9043080	Proof?
9048080	9049080	Proof where it didn't happen.
9050080	9053080	Bring it back to the other side of the spinny platform.
9055080	9056080	The spinny platform.
9057080	9058080	Is there a spinny platform?
9059080	9060080	Oh, that goes up.
9061080	9062080	Okay.
9066080	9067080	Oh, there you go.
9073080	9075080	Oh, nobody leaves without a toy.
9080080	9081080	Oh, yeah, you're right.
9081080	9082080	The toy scanner.
9082080	9083080	The toy scanner.
9083080	9084080	Okay.
9084080	9085080	Okay.
9085080	9086080	Okay.
9086080	9087080	Okay.
9087080	9088080	The toy scanner.
9089080	9090080	Oh, shit.
9091080	9092080	Oh, shit.
9092080	9093080	Here we go again.
9093080	9094080	I need that one.
9102080	9104080	I can't believe the NSFW Twitter was official.
9104080	9105080	What do you mean?
9107080	9112080	Do you not know anything about us as streamers at all?
9114080	9115080	I'm not as streamers.
9115080	9116080	I guess as a company.
9119080	9120080	What time is it?
9121080	9122080	It's 8pm.
9134080	9135080	Yippee.
9143080	9145080	I've highly educated myself.
9146080	9149080	Listen, I've had a stressful evening here.
9149080	9151080	Of course, I'm going to be tired.
9152080	9153080	Okay.
9158080	9159080	On the whole.
9163080	9164080	The V-Sack.
9168080	9169080	Wait, what?
9173080	9174080	Was I here before?
9175080	9176080	No, I guess not.
9179080	9180080	What?
9182080	9185080	Okay, I'm glad no one made fun of me for being tired at 8.
9191080	9192080	What do I do here?
9199080	9200080	This part is tricky.
9206080	9210080	Okay, will I go another direction then?
9211080	9213080	I'm tired the moment I wake up.
9213080	9214080	Me too.
9214080	9215080	Me too.
9215080	9218080	That is very real.
9228080	9230080	Oh, this is a different place.
9230080	9231080	Wait, no, it's not.
9231080	9232080	No, wait, yes it is.
9232080	9233080	Okay.
9236080	9238080	Wait, oh no, I need...
9239080	9240080	Oh, I almost fell down.
9240080	9241080	Okay.
9247080	9249080	Are you fucking shitting me?
9249080	9250080	Wait, what?
9252080	9253080	Hold on.
9253080	9254080	Oh.
9255080	9256080	I thought I was gonna...
9256080	9257080	Okay.
9266080	9269080	I had a little bit of a delay reaction.
9269080	9270080	Excuse me.
9272080	9273080	Okay.
9274080	9275080	Okay.
9278080	9280080	Okay, okay, okay, okay, I'm gonna...
9280080	9281080	Huh?
9283080	9285080	Why did you lock it?
9285080	9286080	What?
9287080	9288080	Oh.
9288080	9290080	Wait, no, don't use that hand, don't use that hand.
9290080	9291080	Okay.
9296080	9297080	Ah.
9297080	9298080	What?
9298080	9299080	What?
9299080	9300080	Sorry, sorry.
9301080	9303080	It's still locked though.
9305080	9308080	In order to get the red tape,
9308080	9310080	you need to touch the second electric pole.
9315080	9317080	The second electric pole.
9318080	9319080	Do I go back this way?
9319080	9320080	Okay.
9322080	9325080	When we can hear you smile when you talk, that's the cutest shit.
9327080	9328080	Can you hear me smile?
9328080	9331080	I think it's mostly that you can see me smile.
9335080	9337080	Further from the panel.
9338080	9339080	Panel.
9339080	9340080	What is a panel?
9340080	9342080	There's a panel here?
9344080	9345080	Hello?
9346080	9347080	Did I fuck it up?
9347080	9348080	Hello?
9348080	9349080	Uh-oh.
9356080	9358080	You can hear me smile?
9358080	9359080	Aww.
9360080	9362080	Step one, grab one.
9363080	9364080	I grabbed one.
9372080	9374080	You have to activate the other room
9374080	9376080	and then go back with your hand still connected.
9378080	9380080	Touch only the further pole.
9390080	9391080	Oops.
9393080	9395080	Okay, only the further pole.
9398080	9402080	Oh, okay.
9407080	9408080	Oh.
9410080	9411080	Okay, okay.
9412080	9413080	Oh.
9414080	9415080	Wait, what?
9415080	9416080	Hold on.
9416080	9417080	What just happened?
9417080	9418080	What?
9418080	9419080	Wait.
9422080	9424080	The circle in the middle of the screen
9424080	9425080	indicates how far your arm...
9425080	9426080	Oh, there was a circle.
9427080	9429080	Wait, I feel like I just did nothing.
9429080	9430080	What did I...?
9431080	9432080	Wait.
9433080	9434080	What did I just do?
9435080	9436080	That was nothing.
9436080	9437080	Did I...
9439080	9441080	Your smile sounds like ara ara, what the fuck?
9441080	9442080	How is that...
9442080	9443080	What?
9445080	9446080	What did I...
9446080	9447080	What did I...
9447080	9448080	What did I forget?
9452080	9453080	Stop.
9453080	9455080	When you type in me like that,
9455080	9458080	it makes me feel like you're disappointed in me.
9460080	9462080	Where do I go now?
9463080	9465080	Red door was open.
9465080	9467080	It was open, you're right.
9468080	9469080	It was open.
9470080	9471080	What do I do with it?
9475080	9476080	Come on.
9482080	9483080	Repeat the steps.
9485080	9487080	You did great, just forgot to send energy
9487080	9488080	to the one in the wall.
9489080	9492080	Don't use my full government name against me.
9496080	9497080	Or there was...
9507080	9508080	Was there another one here?
9511080	9512080	Was there another one here?
9514080	9515080	Am I missing something?
9516080	9517080	Am I missing something?
9519080	9520080	Stop!
9526080	9527080	Stop!
9527080	9529080	If you see channel VR,
9529080	9533080	grab the red tape tucked into the electrical panel.
9535080	9537080	The red tape tucked into the electrical panel.
9537080	9539080	Okay, the red tape tucked into the electrical panel.
9539080	9540080	Okay, okay, okay.
9542080	9543080	Okay, behind me?
9545080	9547080	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
9547080	9549080	Wait, now I feel like I'm going the wrong direction.
9555080	9556080	Okay.
9556080	9557080	Electrical panel.
9560080	9561080	Oh my fucking god.
9561080	9563080	The way they make me kill myself here?
9563080	9564080	It's like...
9565080	9567080	It's like extra punishment.
9567080	9568080	Okay.
9575080	9576080	You can die later.
9577080	9578080	Kill me now, please.
9579080	9580080	I don't want to.
9581080	9583080	You've tortured me enough.
9584080	9585080	Get your...
9585080	9587080	Pull yourself back up, soldier.
9590080	9591080	Okay.
9594080	9595080	Okay.
9597080	9598080	Okay.
9601080	9602080	Oh!
9602080	9604080	How am I supposed to see that?
9606080	9607080	How is...
9608080	9610080	How am I supposed to see that?
9610080	9611080	Okay, wait.
9616080	9617080	Oh, this one.
9622080	9624080	Am I supposed to keep my hand there?
9624080	9625080	Okay.
9628080	9630080	Oh, that's the wrong thing there.
9654080	9659080	Is he talking about...
9669080	9671080	Is he talking about mommy?
9674080	9675080	I am a good girl.
9675080	9679080	I'm a good girl for suffering through this game with you.
9680080	9682080	Okay, where do I go now?
9684080	9687080	You can pick all the bookers with that thing.
9688080	9689080	Yeah, he is.
9689080	9690080	Okay, okay.
9693080	9694080	Do I leave?
9700080	9701080	That's not...
9706080	9708080	Spiders aren't scary, I agree.
9708080	9709080	I have a spider.
9710080	9711080	Her name is Rangel,
9711080	9713080	and she's a tarantula.
9714080	9716080	And she's an Arizona blonde,
9716080	9718080	and she's five years old,
9719080	9721080	and she's really fat.
9722080	9725080	You gotta do it again and go through the other door.
9727080	9728080	The best girl?
9728080	9730080	Your best girl?
9730080	9731080	No.
9741080	9744080	You have to need to get through the electrical door.
9746080	9747080	Electrical door.
9747080	9748080	There's another door.
9750080	9752080	Okay, I'm gonna go here.
9755080	9756080	Another door.
9756080	9757080	This door?
9761080	9764080	Jumping spiders are really cute.
9767080	9769080	Is it this door?
9771080	9774080	What's the point of using both of these?
9775080	9777080	What if I just do one?
9780080	9781080	Nothing.
9783080	9785080	In the room with the TV.
9786080	9788080	The other outlet.
9791080	9792080	The other outlet.
9806080	9808080	Did you try to type in me,
9808080	9811080	and instead of correct it to I'm my?
9812080	9814080	Right there, the circle.
9815080	9817080	The circle in front of me.
9819080	9821080	The circle in front of me.
9822080	9824080	The circle, the circle in front of me.
9825080	9827080	The circle in front of me.
9827080	9829080	The circle in front of me.
9829080	9831080	It's just that simple, the circle in front of me, right.
9832080	9834080	Why don't I think about that circle in front of me?
9834080	9837080	Yeah, but yeah, I get it.
9838080	9840080	Yeah, the circle in front of me.
9842080	9844080	The circle in front of me.
9844080	9862760	All these squares make a circle, and I'm in the middle, and all the rest of the wolves
9862760	9868200	are around me, and no one wants to be my mate, and I'm getting publicly humiliated because
9868200	9875200	no one wants to be my mate!
9875200	9904200	I don't need sleep, I need to finish this fucking level, that's what I need!
9904200	9933200	Okay, fine, jeez, let's go up left, tell me what to do now?
9934200	9951200	Look for the number 2 in the room with the VCR.
9951200	9954200	Your circle is your reticle, are you?
9954200	9958200	Are you shitting on my dick right now?
9959200	9965200	Swing across, open door, swing back, connect power.
9965200	9974200	Swing across, you gotta connect 1 to 2.
9974200	9980200	Okay, what?
9980200	9984200	I should be in front of the...
9984200	9988200	When you open the door, don't take the energy out of it.
10005200	10011200	Number 2?
10011200	10014200	Number 2?
10014200	10017200	2?
10017200	10023200	Any 2s?
10023200	10028200	Why won't it work?
10028200	10032200	Huh?
10033200	10039200	It's right there, it's right there!
10039200	10041200	What's going on, what's going on?
10041200	10046200	It's right there, it's right there, it's right there, just let me...
10046200	10049200	You have to swing back?
10049200	10051200	Huh?
10051200	10057200	What is a reticle, what does a reticle mean?
10057200	10060200	You have to swing back, you need the green one?
10060200	10062200	There's a green one?
10062200	10068200	Swing to the other room, then let go, then let go, left hand go through the door,
10068200	10072200	you will be back to the first, activate the pull, that doesn't...
10072200	10078200	You need green power.
10078200	10084200	Green power, of course!
10084200	10088200	Right, yeah, green power, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I need green power.
10088200	10094200	You gotta open the door to go through the red side to get the electricity.
10094200	10098200	Yeah, green power, yeah.
10098200	10101200	Why don't we go to sleep?
10101200	10105200	If I pass this, do I win?
10105200	10112200	Like how much more is there?
10112200	10119200	Do I need both of these?
10119200	10126200	In the middle of the screen you got a little rectangle.
10126200	10132200	No?
10132200	10134200	The lid?
10134200	10144200	I feel like...
10144200	10151200	Okay wait, so do I need both of these?
10151200	10156200	Hold on, I have an idea, I have an idea, I have an idea, let me do something here.
10156200	10161200	Let me do something.
10161200	10176200	What the fuck is this called?
10176200	10181200	Yeah, stand back, I'm starting to cook with gas now, okay?
10181200	10197200	What is this part? What should I call this part?
10197200	10203200	Come on, fucking ad.
10203200	10209200	Wait, is there such a thing as YouTube dark mode?
10209200	10223200	Okay, we passed that, we passed that.
10223200	10229200	Oh fuck, we're almost at three hours?
10229200	10237200	Okay, we passed that.
10237200	10243200	YouTube has a dark mode?
10243200	10250200	Oh this is the room, okay.
10250200	10255200	I want to finish this fucking game dude.
10255200	10263200	I'm not about to change the dark mode right now, let me have my fucking light mode.
10263200	10268200	I like light mode.
10268200	10274200	I know it's muted, I know it's muted.
10274200	10287200	Is he figuring it out himself currently? Does he not know how to play either?
10287200	10293200	Cause he looks like he doesn't know how to play either.
10293200	10298200	Come on dude, come on, this is a walkthrough, you're supposed to know what to do already, come on man.
10298200	10301200	Maybe he's talking?
10301200	10304200	No, he's not even talking.
10304200	10310200	Come on man, don't waste my time here, come on.
10310200	10314200	Oh my god, you dumbass.
10314200	10321200	Wait what?
10321200	10327200	Wait what?
10327200	10329200	Is this guy stupid?
10329200	10334200	Is he being stupid on purpose?
10334200	10339200	He's not talking.
10339200	10343200	Bro, this is not a walkthrough.
10343200	10349200	How are you going to fucking die during a walkthrough?
10361200	10370200	Yeah everyone's stupid except for me.
10370200	10376200	Come on, you can do it, come on.
10376200	10380200	Play it at two times speed.
10380200	10388200	Does he get stuck here too? Cause it looks like he's almost not...
10388200	10391200	Okay no, I'm not watching this, I'm not fucking watching this.
10391200	10395200	Give me a walkthrough.
10395200	10411200	Like show me that you know what you're doing.
10411200	10419200	Oh my fucking god.
10419200	10422200	This is so frustrating.
10422200	10427200	It's literally a pre-recorded video, cut out the parts where you fucking die.
10427200	10430200	Isn't that fucking hard? It's a walkthrough.
10430200	10433200	Walk me through the game, why are you showing me you dying?
10433200	10447200	Do you want me to copy that too? Do you want me to copy every time you fucking die?
10447200	10454200	Wait, what?
10454200	10458200	Wait, what just happened?
10458200	10464200	Let me look through that again.
10464200	10474200	Okay.
10474200	10480200	Oh you have to do it really quickly and you have to get both of them.
10480200	10489200	It stays open.
10489200	10495200	Okay.
10495200	10499200	Oh god it's lagging, why is it lagging?
10499200	10502200	Okay.
10502200	10505200	Okay, hold on, let me...
10505200	10520200	God this game hurts to look at.
10520200	10533200	This developer should KYS.
10533200	10541200	One out, one out.
10541200	10545200	What do you mean gamma? Do I have something?
10545200	10550200	This play capture? Do I have like a filter on my...
10550200	10561200	Where's the gamma? What gamma are you talking about? There's no gamma.
10561200	10567200	The developer should kiss his sister.
10567200	10572200	Turn your brain around, do you hate it so much?
10572200	10575200	Like, huh?
10575200	10578200	Is that better? Is that what you want?
10578200	10580200	Thank you for the pet.
10580200	10583200	Okay, I'm as the same thing as Brainus, but I feel like this is too dark.
10583200	10586200	I'm really blind, man.
10586200	10589200	Okay.
10589200	10595200	Let me see what he does.
10595200	10601200	Where do you go? Back in here.
10601200	10610200	Okay, okay.
10610200	10614200	Nothing is brighter than your smile, oh you.
10614200	10618200	Nothing may be bright and OBS.
10618200	10625200	Like my display capture doesn't have any gamma filters or anything.
10625200	10627200	Yeah, of course I fucking love the dislike, are you kidding me?
10627200	10630200	What's the fucking effort into your walkthrough?
10630200	10632200	It's not that hard.
10632200	10633200	Wait, what?
10633200	10639200	The wrong direction?
10639200	10644200	If you could just watch the rest of the playthrough?
10644200	10650200	Okay, oh shit.
10650200	10652200	This is when mommy chases me.
10652200	10655200	Okay, if I get stuck here with mommy, I'm gonna...
10655200	10657200	I will end, right?
10658200	10663200	I asked you to play fair and you cheated.
10663200	10664200	Great cheaters.
10664200	10667200	What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?
10667200	10670200	One last game.
10670200	10672200	Okay.
10672200	10674200	Hide and...
10674200	10675200	Stay.
10675200	10677200	Fuck.
10677200	10678200	Ten.
10678200	10680200	Nine.
10680200	10684200	God, the way she goes crazy is so sexy.
10684200	10688200	I hate her before but her voice is so hot.
10697200	10700200	Am I actually supposed to hide?
10715200	10720200	I'll just run? Okay.
10720200	10725200	I'll just run.
10725200	10727200	I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.
10727200	10730200	I feel like it's really suspiciously quiet.
10730200	10732200	Oh, come on now.
10732200	10736200	Did I go the wrong direction?
10736200	10737200	Okay, wait, I'm pausing.
10737200	10738200	What did I do wrong?
10738200	10743200	What did I do wrong this time?
10745200	10751200	Did I go the wrong direction?
10751200	10755200	Up?
10755200	10758200	Hello, you silent when I'm crazy?
10758200	10762200	You can go listen to me be crazy if you want.
10762200	10764200	There should be a handle.
10764200	10768200	Stop saying I'm mine.
10775200	10778200	Okay, look up where?
10778200	10780200	Look up where?
10780200	10781200	Where is the up?
10781200	10785200	Where is the up?
10785200	10790200	You have to pull yourself off while she passes by.
10799200	10802200	I feel like I'm just walking towards her now.
10802200	10806200	Here?
10806200	10810200	Wait, what? Am I?
10815200	10818200	I think therefore I'm mine.
10818200	10822200	Go back?
10826200	10830200	Is there some sort of timer?
10830200	10833200	I was doing it right the first time?
10833200	10836200	Oh.
10836200	10842200	Okay, and now she's going to chase me through this?
10842200	10845200	Get back to me!
10845200	10850200	Okay, okay.
10850200	10857200	I feel like I should be getting chased right now.
10857200	10862200	There's no urgency here.
10862200	10868200	Should I do all of these?
10868200	10873200	Put the figure in a jiffy.
10873200	10878200	Put the figure in a jar.
10885200	10889200	There's an order.
10889200	10892200	I'm guessing it's...
10892200	10896200	Red, yellow, blue, green.
10896200	10901200	Red, yellow, blue, green.
10904200	10911200	A common tactic in this game when stuck is to look up.

11656620	11658620	To fuck you over.
11659620	11662620	Laugh isn't really sexy anymore.
11663620	11666620	I don't want to play with you anymore. You're not sexy.
11677620	11682620	She legit sounds like she's painfully gagging on something.
11682620	11684620	Yeah, gagging on my dick!
11689620	11695620	It's not a skill issue. It's a game issue.
11696620	11698620	They just have to fix their aim.
11699620	11703620	The game obviously is poorly optimized here.
11703620	11708620	If they can't pick up my perfectly aimed mouse cursor.
11711620	11713620	Gagging on the two-way check.
11713620	11716620	Come on! Did I walk into her?
11720620	11723620	Shut up! There's so much to gag on it.
11723620	11726620	It'll go so deep in your throat just you fucking wait.
11729620	11730620	Cough.
11735620	11736620	Okay.
11737620	11738620	I'll do it this time.
11740620	11742620	Your throat will be so sore.
11742620	11743620	Your dentist is gonna be like,
11743620	11747620	God damn, were you gagging on a fucking...
11747620	11749620	I don't know.
11751620	11754620	Were you gagging on Amy's dick last night?
11754620	11758620	Because that's the only cock that would be long enough to make such...
11758620	11760620	such damage to your throat.
11764620	11766620	I got it that time!
11769620	11771620	I fucking got it that time!
11774620	11775620	Too slow.
11777620	11778620	The dentist knows?
11778620	11782620	Yeah, there's like bruising at the back of your throat sometimes.
11782620	11784620	The dentist will know.
11784620	11787620	I'll make sure that throat is bruised up, baby.
11795620	11796620	Fuck this barrel!
11813620	11814620	No!
11815620	11816620	Get up you fucker with my craft!

11820620	11822620	In my craft, in my craft, in my craft.
11827620	11828620	In my craft, in my craft, in my craft, in my craft.
11828620	11830620	In my craft, in game, in game, in game, in game, in game, in game,
11830620	11832620	In game, in game, I, I, I died in game.
11832620	11834620	I died in game.
11842620	11845620	My throat is literally killing me right now.
11845620	11846120	Oh.
11856120	11859620	Wait, I take a long time because I'm trying to.
11859620	11864620	I'm trying to ink correctly.
11864620	11865620	Oh my god.
11870620	11871620	Oh my god.
11872620	11873620	Oh my god.
11882620	11885620	Okay, if I don't get it this time, I'm literally stopping.
11885620	11888620	And we'll finish it the next time.
11888620	11890620	I can't.
11893620	11895620	We'll finish the next time.
11899620	11901620	I didn't even see it.
11901620	11904620	I had it and I didn't even know.
11904620	11906620	I didn't know what I was doing.
11906620	11908620	How do people do this?
11908620	11911620	This is like way harder than the first chapter.
11932620	11935620	What do I do?
11935620	11936620	Please tell me what to do.
11936620	11937620	Please tell me what to do.
11959620	11960620	Why is it so slow?
11960620	11963620	Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
11975620	11978620	Die, bitch! Die!
11983620	11986620	I love seeing you in pain!

12045620	12046620	Please tell me.
12046620	12047620	That's it.
12056620	12059620	I know I'm so good at games.
12059620	12066620	Like, really, they should have considered that I might play this game and make it harder
12066620	12068620	because this was just too easy.
12070620	12072620	Hi, I fucking saved your life, bitch.
12080620	12081620	What?
12084620	12086620	Do I have to read that?
12089620	12090620	I can't read that.

12148620	12149620	Where am I going?
12158620	12159620	You skipped a tape?
12159620	12160620	I don't fucking care.
12166620	12167620	Was it important?
12167620	12169620	Was it really important?
12174620	12176620	That thing, that thing, that thing, that thing.
12179620	12180620	Do I press buttons?
12186620	12187620	I'm confused.

12223620	12224620	The next thing is red.
12225620	12226620	Okay.
12226620	12227620	The last thing is blue.
12228620	12229620	Oh wait.
12234620	12236620	Oh, now I have to put them in the right order.
12241620	12243620	Red, yellow, red, blue.
12246620	12247620	Now what?
12247620	12248620	It's in the right order.
12250620	12252620	Hit the arrow to put them in the same order.
12252620	12253620	Yeah, they're in the same order.
12254620	12255620	Yeah.
12256620	12257620	Red, yellow, red, blue.
12258620	12259620	The color.
12259620	12261620	I've seen subscribers break their brains on this puzzle.
12261620	12263620	You understood it immediately?
12263620	12264620	Password three?
12266620	12267620	One, four, two, three.
12269620	12270620	How do I change the numbers?
12278620	12279620	But how do I change them?
12283620	12284620	Push them?
12289620	12290620	Punch them?
12299620	12300620	I can't click on it.
12316620	12317620	Huh.
12319620	12320620	Click on the faces?
12322620	12323620	Oh.
12323620	12326620	One, four, two, three.
12328620	12329620	Go.
12334620	12335620	Go.
12335620	12336620	Let's go.
12337620	12338620	Let's leave this.
12338620	12339620	Oh, is it going?
12340620	12341620	Yippee.
12342620	12343620	Re-game.
12349620	12350620	Red lever's a break?
12350620	12351620	Oh, we don't want to break.
12352620	12353620	Choo-choo.
12353620	12354620	Can I go choo-choo?
12354620	12355620	Choo-choo.
12357620	12358620	Choo-choo.
12360620	12361620	Yay.
12361620	12362620	Choo-choo.
12362620	12363620	Choo-choo.
12364620	12365620	Oh my god, I'm so tired.
12366620	12367620	Let's go.
12371620	12373620	I ran out of water again.
12374620	12375620	Phew.
12378620	12379620	Get applauded.
12379620	12380620	Get applauded.
12384620	12385620	Hm?
12389620	12390620	Ew.
12396620	12397620	Whoa.
12399620	12400620	What?
12403620	12404620	What?
12411620	12412620	Sounds like me?
12416620	12418620	Time to figure out what's happening.
12421620	12422620	Hm?
12426620	12429620	I'm not good at copying voices like Chibi.
12431620	12432620	What?
12433620	12434620	Hm?
12436620	12437620	Hm?
12438620	12439620	What happened?
12444620	12446620	What happened?
12446620	12448620	Why is it going faster?
12448620	12449620	Where are we going?
12449620	12452620	Why are we going so fucking fast?
12452620	12453620	Are we tilting?
12454620	12456620	Are we getting tilted right now?
12457620	12458620	Get tilted.
12459620	12462620	I feel like something bad is going to happen.
12463620	12464620	Hm?
12466620	12467620	What do I do?
12467620	12468620	Do-do.
12468620	12470620	We're going to die.
12471620	12472620	Stop train.
12473620	12474620	I can't.
12474620	12475620	No brakes.
12475620	12477620	No brakes on the train.
12481620	12483620	It's not going to work.
12484620	12485620	My hand.
12485620	12487620	Don't rip my hand off.
12494620	12496620	Oh, that was it, wasn't it?
12501620	12502620	Playcare?
12505620	12506620	Never mind playcare.
12506620	12509620	I need some fucking aftercare after getting fucked in the ass so hard.
12512620	12513620	We did it.
12513620	12514620	We did it.
12514620	12515620	We did it.
12515620	12516620	We did it.
12516620	12517620	We did it.
12517620	12518620	We did it.
12518620	12519620	Chapter 3 tomorrow?
12519620	12522620	No, I already have something planned for chapter 3.
12522620	12525620	I already have stuff planned for next week too.
12525620	12528620	Maybe the week after that we can do chapter 3.
12529620	12532620	There's Jacks but I see Big Spider.
12541620	12543620	Yeah, I did it.
12543620	12544620	I did it.
12551620	12552620	Is that it?
12552620	12553620	There's not like other-
12554620	12555620	Shut up.
12555620	12557620	It is not story early for another horror game.
12557620	12558620	I can't.
12558620	12559620	My mind is-
12559620	12561620	I've been mind broken.
12562620	12564620	What do you want as a reward?
12566620	12567620	A shower.
12569620	12570620	A shower.
12571620	12574620	We can shower together as a reward.
12578620	12581620	A shower and a cough drop and some tea.
12581620	12583620	That's what I want as a reward.
12585620	12586620	Yeah, together.
12592620	12593620	Quit.
12593620	12594620	Quit.
12598620	12599620	Okay.
12600620	12601620	Quit.
12608620	12609620	Oh, shit.
12609620	12610620	Now the chat has to cap up.
12610620	12611620	Cap up.
12611620	12612620	Check.
12612620	12613620	Check up.
12613620	12614620	Check.
12614620	12615620	Check.
12615620	12616620	Check.
12618620	12619620	Catch up.
12620620	12621620	Okay.
12622620	12623620	Yeah.
12623620	12624620	Thank you for coming.
12624620	12625620	I did it.
12625620	12626620	I usually-
12626620	12627620	I usually release stream too.
12627620	12630620	I'm fucking blinking like a fucking frog right now.
12630620	12631620	I usually only-
12631620	12633620	Okay, that's really distracting.
12633620	12636620	I usually only stream for two hours.
12636620	12638620	But I guess we were here for the long run.
12638620	12642620	Thank you so much for coming and staying
12642620	12644620	and helping me the whole time.
12644620	12648620	Encouraging me and praising me when I was going insane.
12651620	12652620	I'll see you tomorrow.
12652620	12654620	I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
12654620	12657620	I think it's going to be really funny and exciting.
12660620	12661620	Bye-bye.
12662620	12664620	I love you, big bro.
12684620	12685620	Bye-bye.
