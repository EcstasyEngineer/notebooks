Not about being stinky, though.

15
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But it's my favorite stench.

16
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Sure, you're a general pervert to most women in town.

17
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You dress like you're homeless.

18
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You went to juvie twice before the age of 12.

19
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But they're all wrong about you.

20
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
All of them.

21
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Every single cop, and priest, and guidance counselor, and medical professional, and fast food cashier.

22
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
All the funny pranks we used to do

23
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
are big big heists

24
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
are

25
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
knights together.

26
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Aw, I miss them.

27
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I know it's been a while since I last saw you.

28
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You might not care,

30
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
but mom and dad stopped talking about you for a while now.

31
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
They act like you never existed.

32
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They smile a lot more now,

33
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
as if they didn't see what I saw.

34
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So, I left them.

35
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't need them anyway.

36
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
When I have you back,

37
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
all we'll need is each other.

38
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And they don't even know I found your book,

39
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
so they don't know that I can bring you back.

40
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't want to mess it up like,

41
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
last time,

42
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and the time before that.

43
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But don't make fun of me.

44
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I was new at it,

45
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
so I'm gonna be a big pro

46
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
before I bring back my big bro.

47
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, right.

48
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Last time we talked,

49
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
you said someone was keeping you from coming back.

50
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, that's what I figured between all your screaming.

51
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You were probably a pro at this magical stuff, huh, big bro?

52
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Which means they must be real nasty

53
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
to be able to keep you from coming back.

54
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm still starting out,

55
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
so I make lots of mistakes.

56
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But I'm not scared.

57
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I've been practicing all over town.

58
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm leveling up so I can smash the final boss

59
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
as soon as I see them.

60
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And then I'll find them, got them,

61
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
bring you back, and then we can...

62
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Everything will be perfect.

63
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah.

64
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't care who it is.

65
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
A ghost? An angel?

66
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Or even the devil herself.

67
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You're gonna be back home again.

68
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And we can finally...

69
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I hope you can still hear me.

70
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
No, I know you can.

71
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I know you'd do the same for me.

72
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So never think that I'll quit.

73
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll tear through Hell and Earth myself if I have to.

74
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll practice and practice and practice.

75
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And when I'm the perfect woman for you,

76
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I will take you home.

77
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Wait for me.

78
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll see you later, big bro.

79
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Hey, you. You're finally awake.

80
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You were trying to cross the border, right?

81
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Blocked right into that Imperial ambush.

82
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Seems us.

83
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I wonder what you're doing.

84
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Hello? Oh my goodness!

85
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Hello, hello, hello, welcome!

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Did you enjoy Mercy's dream?

87
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And Azura's dream?

88
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And Icy's dream?

89
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's nice to see you're still in one piece after Mercy,

90
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
because, you know,

91
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
after you're done with me,

92
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
there won't be anything left of you big brother.

93
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000

look at you, you are so smart

155
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,880
O.K

156
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Let's move on to this next room. Up here, I have my rat room.

157
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,880
That's right, I got four rats. I can already see the memes in chat.

158
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,880
Rats, I was rats once. They left me in a room full of crazy.

159
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,880
And crazy makes me rats. Okay, yeah, yeah, I have four rats.

160
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Now, obviously, I don't want to break your immersion here a little bit.

161
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,880
But they don't look like this in real life.

162
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,880
Okay, I know it's hard to tell, but we are in Minecraft right now.

163
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:15,880
So you will see them for real in real life IRL during my hand cam streams.

164
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,880
Yeah, I'm going to try to have them out during hand cam streams so you can formally meet them.

165
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Okay, so right across this beam here, I have my bedroom.

166
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,880
I mean, the red paint on the floor.

167
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:40,880
So I also have these plushies next to my bed, you know, the plushies I hold while I cry myself to sleep, the five nights up for these plushies.

168
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,880
And over here is my little desk with my pewter.

169
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Yeah, this is my computer. This is literally where I am streaming from right now.

170
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,880
This is where I tweet from. Okay, and here I have my steam library open.

171
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:07,880
So, okay, I know some of you might feel a little scared right now looking at these games, you know, you see, oh fuck, Valorant, League of Legends.

172
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,880
She's a loser, she's a loser version, what the fuck.

173
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,880
No, I'm not a gamer, okay, your sister is not a gamer.

174
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,880
So don't don't look at these games and be like, oh man, that's so disappointing.

175
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,880
I will be playing that many games, but these are the games that I want to try eventually.

176
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,880
Will I even get to all of them? I don't even know.

177
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:43,880
I don't even know if I'll get to all of these because, like I said before, most of my streams will mostly be made up of me dicking around, like doing challenges, doing like DIY stuff, like handcams.

178
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Just, you'll see during my schedule, you'll see, I mostly just dick around.

179
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Okay, so here on this blackboard, I have my goals. Yep, I've written down my goals.

180
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,880
So my first goal and the most important goal is to not give up.

181
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,880
I'm a very fragile soul, okay, if you leave one hate comment, I'm fucking leaving, I'm ending stream.

182
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Okay, but for real, I give up on things super easily, I have a lot of abandoned hobby equipment in my room because I always give up on stuff.

183
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
So yeah, I don't want to give up.

184
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,880
Next, I want to experiment with lots of different types of content.

185
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:33,880
So a lot of ASMR tropes, I want to try clip calculations, I want to try making memes, I even want to try singing, oh fuck.

186
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,880
Okay, we'll move on, I'll come back to that.

187
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,880
I want to do a 3D debut, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm really excited for a 3D debut.

188
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:57,880
I want to touch the other Violaire girls in 3D, I want to sniff their booties, I want to grope them, you know, basically everything you've ever wanted to do to them, I'll be able to do for you in VR.

189
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Fourth is I want to make you happy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, my ultimate goal is to entertain you, you know, to make you laugh and to suck and fuck you.

190
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Okay, we're done here in my room, let me go down here, and let me go to my kitchen.

191
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Okay, I'm not a cook, if you ever do get cooking streams from me, it will be very scuffed, I have lit up a cake on fire, I've lit up a fish on fire, I'm really not a cook, but maybe I can show you my favorite food, you know, the kind of stuff I like to eat, maybe you can cook for me.

192
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Oh, I, okay, oops, so it looks like I forgot to go grocery shopping before this.

193
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Listen, some people might consider it an alcohol addiction, I am simply prioritizing my hydration, yeah, every time you tell me to drink during stream, just know I will be drinking vodka.

194
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,880
And, oh, don't even worry about that one.

195
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,880
Okay, here's my living room.

196
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,880
Yup, this is my living room, this is where I do all my jorgen.

197
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:33,880
Over here's my TV with a notflix open, and no other streaming service I use notflix.

198
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:42,880
So, on the top row is my favorite shows and my favorite movies, and then on the bottom row is my favorite anime.

199
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:54,880
So, my favorite shows, I really, really like kids' cartoons, like old kids' cartoons, so I like My Little Pony, I like Adventure Time, I like Gunball, I like Gravity Falls.

200
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:03,880
I rewatch all those shows back to back constantly, and then my favorite movies are Pearl and Gone Girl.

201
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:17,880
So, if you've ever watched those movies and you might think badly of me, or maybe you're afraid of me because I like those movies, good, you should be.

202
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Okay, moving on.

203
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,880
So, my favorite anime is Freerun, Dungeon Messi, Psyche is a huge comfort anime of mine.

204
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,880
Watamote, the main character is literally me, she is me.

205
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,880
I really like Hellsman Castle and Maiden Abyss, and there's... Breaking Bad at the bottom.

206
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
That wasn't even supposed to be there.

207
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:49,880
Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry, would you look at that, my coffee table is such a mess, oh fuck.

208
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:58,880
Oh, I picked up some pages on my coffee table, it looks like the rats must have been messing with my stuff because apparently they ripped up my diary.

209
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,880
How rude of them.

210
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,880
Well, I guess I can open up to you a little bit and show you my thoughts, my feelings.

211
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,880
Oh, I wrote my first impressions here, okay.

212
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,880
So, for Messi, she's very social, she knows a lot of people, like holy crap, and she's also very sweet.

213
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,880
And her laugh is insane, when I first heard her laugh, I was like, god damn, holy crap, I got scared.

214
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Next is, I see she's god's ebius soldier, a lot of our meetings have been at night, and she's also effortlessly cute, like Oliver, like I heard her yawn once and I was like, god damn, I have to try to be cute, okay?

215
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,880
All of this cuteness you see in front of you is like practiced, but I see it doesn't even have to fucking try.

216
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Strani is super super caring, and she's also a non-stop gamer, and yeah, I don't know how she plays games for so long, like, it couldn't be me, I'm jealous, I want to sit down and play for that long, but I can't.

217
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:06,880
Next is, she's super funny, she's very hyper, you might not notice that she's hyper during her debut, but once you get to know her more, yeah.

218
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:17,880
She's also very good at voice impressions, we were watching a stream together, and she copied the streamer's voice, and I was so surprised because I couldn't tell if it was she be talking or the streamer.

219
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:29,880
And finally we have Azura, Azura is super super chill, she's also good at a lot of games, all the like community games we played together, she like, won all of them.

220
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:38,880
And her voice is just pure sex, every word she says, she just moans it, I don't know how she does it.

221
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:48,880
Alright, so before we end, let me turn the camera back onto myself, and I can show you my model, yup.

222
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,880
Okay, are you ready? I'll show you some of my toggles, okay, okay, okay.

223
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:03,880
So first I have this, you know, little shy arm pose, you know, when I'm feeling shy, oo-woo.

224
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:13,880
I have these love eyes, POV, I'm standing above you while you're sleeping, and watching you sleep.

225
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:23,880
Okay, I have an exclamation point, I have this one, we'll look past that one, that's for different streams, not for YouTube streams.

226
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:34,880
I can cry, sadge, I can be stupid, I mean I'm always stupid, but I can look stupid too.

227
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,880
I can drool, I bet you want to lick that off of my mouth, don't you?

228
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:54,880
I can blush, I can be angry, you don't want to get on my bad side, I'll punish you.

229
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:09,880
I can be scared, and double scared, and also sweaty, I bet you want to lick my sweat too, I've been reading your comments, I know.

230
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,880
I can sleep, look at you, watching me sleep.

231
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:22,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I can take off my jacket, there it is, and you know what else I can take off?

232
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,880
You're never going to guess, are you ready for this?

233
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,880
What could it be, could it be my shorts, could it be my shirt, could it be, could it be, oh it's my shoes.

234
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,880
I can take my shoes off, and I can stomp on you.

235
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,880
Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, okay.

236
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,880
Oh, I think I missed one toggle.

237
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
Is it this one?

238
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,880
There we go, I can cast spells.

239
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,880
Shadow, what is it, Shadow, Wizard Money Gang.

240
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

241
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,880
Enough glooping around, let's go to my schedule, here is my schedule for next week.

242
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:15,880
Yeah, so tomorrow we have a debut, but don't forget about me just yet because I'll see you at the collab stream after this, okay?

243
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:25,880
And then Monday we have an ASMR stream, Tuesday I will be showing you my favorite TikToks, it's basically like a meme review except you're the one that's reviewing the memes and I'm the one showing you the memes.

244
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:40,880
And then Poppy Playtime, and then another ASMR stream, and then I, listen, I didn't make the schedule, I don't know who wrote my life story, I've never played the coffin of Andy and Lay Lay before, but apparently it pertains to me somehow.

245
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:54,880
And then after that we're gonna be making Pop and Cookin', which is like a, it's like a DIY candy, and then after that I'm gonna try to guess characters without my glasses because fun fact I'm actually incredibly blind.

246
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,880
Well because I'm like video game characters and stuff.

247
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
Alright, now.

248
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,880
I want you to come buckets right now.

249
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
What, did you hear that?

250
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
Fucking pull out your cock.

251
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
What, what is that?

252
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,880
I want you to come buckets right now.

253
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,880
That voice sounds familiar, doesn't it?

254
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,880
I think it sounds like a bunny, and I think she's trying to lead us down the rabbit hole into Wonderland.

255
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Maybe, maybe you should follow her, follow her voice, yeah.

256
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,880
And I'll see you again in the collab stream, okay?

257
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,880
Goodbye.

258
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,880
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
