17
00:05:44,800 --> 00:06:01,720
um not anywhere else yeah does it involve webbing no no um I think that's

18
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:09,920
everything oh yeah one more note I know it's very very early in the game to make

19
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,720
a 2.0 model okay and it doesn't mean that I don't like this model I think this

20
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:22,280
model is really cute you know I think I'm really cute but as an artist I'm very

21
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:32,680
very picky I'm super super picky so I want to customize myself more yeah

22
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,840
sorry I'm drinking tea right now I think it's peach tea with mango peach and

23
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:51,200
mango I think I hate mangoes but it's the only tea I have right now so yeah

24
00:06:51,240 --> 00:07:02,280
it's been 75 years since I heard your voice well we're back we are so back so

25
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,920
and plus it's cheaper because I'm an artist so I can I can fucking make a

26
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,400
2.0 whatever I want if I wanted to I could just make the whole thing myself

27
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,920
but I'm lazy as fuck so I'm not going to do that right let me show you let me

28
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,000
show you what I've got going on

29
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:37,880
right I'm gonna make myself a little bit more there so here is a totally legally

30
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:45,380
acquired drawing program that I totally legally acquired and here okay I

31
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,280
traced the model art now I'm not gonna do that for the actual model I'm just

32
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,880
doing it for the design itself when I draw the model itself it's not gonna be

33
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:03,960
traced from this one I look like a fucking goblin I like why do I look

34
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:13,120
like this yes it is paint tool sides paint tool side too um let me drink some

35
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:25,640
actual water so um we are not gonna be bald I needed to be bald because I'm

36
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:33,120
gonna change my hair so this is the naked model I'm going to keep the band-aids

37
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:43,840
I'm gonna keep the wound tattoo and then I have all these elements I want to add I

38
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,680
guess so I want to keep my band-aids I want to keep my freckles I want to keep

39
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,520
them I think I wrote tattoo wrong I don't know I want to have some sort of

40
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:57,880
choker maybe a collar wait hold on let me this thing this has been annoying me

41
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,720
for a long time I didn't mean to do that this has been annoying me for a long

42
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:12,120
time my blinking I open my blinking parameters have been too sensitive so I

43
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:21,560
keep blinking at you let me make them less sensitive how do I do this maybe

44
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,040
shit I don't know how

45
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,880
maybe make them zero point

46
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,280
is that more or less sensitive I don't know okay you know what I should probably

47
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,640
not mess with that right now I should probably not mess with that right now

48
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:55,000
okay anyways anyway let me continue talking um right and so here's stuff I

49
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,800
want to incorporate so right now I'm wearing your sweater but I'm I think I

50
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,720
want to have your shirt too I think I'll take that too and then also I want to

51
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,080
have some sort of twin tails still I want to keep that sort of beam I want to

52
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:22,160
have multiple ear piercings that's right not just one I'm not dating my cousin

53
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:31,080
shut up I'm dating you I'm not gonna add a leash to the collar no I want to have a

54
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:38,400
split tongue yep I want to split it in half because I think that's hot um maybe

55
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:44,760
a belly button piercing I'm not really sure because I feel like I feel like it

56
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,880
might be too much around the belly area if there's both a belly button piercing

57
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:56,840
and a womb tattoo but I don't know maybe glasses maybe leg warmers and I'm still

58
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:04,440
on the fence on if I want to keep my book like like this book here I'm still

59
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:12,200
on the fence on if I want to keep that there I'm not sure yeah

60
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:22,880
so that's that and then here is my ideas that I went on Pinterest and found so

61
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,960
um this is this is your shirt the book is special it is special that's why I

62
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:37,760
kind of feel like I should keep it you know yeah I'll still have I think I want

63
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,960
to keep the pins on my head too I think those are cute and then I like these

64
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:49,160
sort of socks here like the striped nests I like kind of the unevenness of

65
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,520
it like different different lengths I don't have some fishnets to some sort

66
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:01,720
of fishnets if you lose the book how will you resurrect us I know I know I know

67
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,040
I'm sorry you're right maybe I'll keep it and then I really like this hairstyle I

68
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,120
know it's AI art but listen you can't fucking go on Pinterest these days

69
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:16,200
anymore and not find AI art so yeah I like these really short braids like

70
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,000
really really short that kind of on the side are on the side of her head too I'm

71
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,160
not sure if that makes sense and also like I'll have the same side bangs I

72
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,400
won't have these middle bangs I want a heart tongue piercing I want a heart

73
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,640
tongue piercing oh my god I think it's so cute I like this whole outfit I found

74
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,480
it on I found this one on Twitter I like this piercing here I think I'm gonna

75
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:53,960
flip the I think I'm gonna flip the cross upside down but I kind of like it

76
00:12:53,960 --> 00:13:00,200
and then I cuz I I wanted to still have the loom tattoo visible so I thought

77
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,680
this was kind of like a good base outfit to start off with especially with

78
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,920
the fishnets can't you have two tongue piercings I guess but I don't think that

79
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:19,640
would look good I like these earrings I don't know if I'll have these ones

80
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,240
hanging down I'm not sure I don't want it I don't want it to be too complicated

81
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:30,160
but I keep ripping but we'll see don't be disappointed when Ronnie I know she's

82
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,600
not God I know she's not God I'm I might keep the same shoes I'm thinking of

83
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:45,480
keeping the same style but like dying them black I'm not sure I like I want I

84
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,020
like the jeans skirt here but I don't like the color and I feel like it's a

85
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,440
little bit too short and tight I might make it a little more flared out and

86
00:13:52,440 --> 00:14:02,680
longer and I like the two bows on the on the on the pockets I think that's

87
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,520
so this is what I've compiled but obviously if you don't like something we

88
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:19,960
can change it get some J's what's J's like are those shoes hmm I think something

89
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,400
that some of you may not have noticed either is these are your shoes too

90
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,320
at least I think they're your shoes let me make sure let me just make sure I'm

91
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,520
I'm pretty sure those are your shoes too

92
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:49,080
videos lore let me scroll through the lore here yeah look oh wait I can't show

93
00:14:49,080 --> 00:15:04,320
you I'll just I'll take a screenshot and then I'll add it to the drawing

94
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:14,600
program look these are your shoes that I'm wearing I stole a lot of your clothes

95
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,200
and now I'm gonna steal your shirt too yeah it's not big feet they're just big

96
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:31,580
shoes okay they're not big feet yeah good morning good morning

97
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,200
I'm a little skeptical about how of how all of these are gonna look together on

98
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,560
your cute and funny body but you're very talented artists so I'm excited to see

99
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:50,000
don't worry I'll make them fit I'll make them look good right so let's start

100
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:01,280
with the hair now normally I wouldn't do art streams because well I just feel

101
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:07,520
like people aren't really interested in watching me draw it's not really a I

102
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,120
think I need to I'm gonna just look at myself for a reference on on what my

103
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,600
looks like it's not really um something that even I watch a lot because I don't

104
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,680
find it entertaining either also notice not to you know to you not notice

105
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:31,160
self don't take anything I draw here as like um as like a good indication of my

106
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,600
art skills okay don't take don't take this as like an indication of how good I

107
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:43,360
am the art because I'm truly really um I'm not as bad I'm not as bad as I may

108
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:52,240
look okay I'm during the stream thank you my craft cursor you don't see it in the

109
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,440
art program do you I'm always interested oh thank you

110
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,160
I ran out of tea

111
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:14,160
I'm eating my mic too all right all right all right um what are you using to draw

112
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:26,600
yes a lovely lovely viewer gifted me a freaking who we on is that how you

113
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,720
pronounce it no wait sorry why come why come why come we come we come why come

114
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:39,400
I don't know um there it's like a really popular um brand of drawing tablet and I

115
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:46,960
never had one before I was really scared of getting a wake-up tablet because I've

116
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,000
always had like such bad experience with every single tablet I've ever gone

117
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,240
literally every single tablet I've ever purchased already had a similar literally

118
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,080
every single tablet I've ever purchased has always come to me broken it's always

119
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,840
been delivered to me broken so I was really worried oops I probably shouldn't

120
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:13,560
that I was really worried that if I got my head is so flat where is the brain why

121
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:19,840
do I have no brain here I was really worried that if I were to order a wake

122
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:27,440
up tablet then um it would come to me delivered and then I would have spent all

123
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:36,520
that money just to you know be annoyed so yeah did I say it would come to me

124
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,800
delivered it would come to me broken it would be delivered to me broken and I

125
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,680
don't want that to happen one brain cell in me I have more than one brain cell

126
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,160
I'll prove it to you I'll prove it to you but for some reason the model artist

127
00:18:53,160 --> 00:19:03,240
which um that drew you know this model kind of gave me a really flat head like

128
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:13,280
this this dome here that you see here is is bigger I I enlarged my brain just to

129
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,880
make it look normal like this is bigger than what my actual head shape this is

130
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,040
bigger than what my actual head shape was and it's kind of embarrassing through me

131
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,080
what does that mean

132
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:41,560
doctored head size no it doesn't have a screen I don't like um I actually don't

133
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:48,040
like I don't think sorry I'm trying to decide if I should keep the the side

134
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,920
bangs I feel like they look a little bit it's a little bit hard for me to draw

135
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:59,960
them I always have problems trying my own side bangs so I might not keep them

136
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,200
but I feel like they're too much of a staple I don't know it's gonna be rough

137
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:14,480
it's gonna be rough I'm not sure my side bangs like gold on top of my hair and

138
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:21,880
on my hair my eyes oh we're really going in with this what 50 Baku Deku

139
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:27,160
tiktok's does to a motherfucker what do you mean what do you mean by that what

140
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:35,120
do you mean by that huh nothing it does nothing to a motherfucker you saying it

141
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,280
makes them emo or you're saying it makes them stupid and that's when my head is

142
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:46,480
so small that's when my fucking head is so small yeah I also wanted to round out

143
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:54,240
my eyebrows more I really really really really like round eyebrows so I'm

144
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:02,040
gonna round out my eyebrows I've always really liked round eyebrows I think they

145
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:10,840
really cute I already look so strange I feel like I'm literally just

146
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,800
recreating my own model yet for some reason something's wrong side bangs are

147
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:22,960
cute they are cute but I'm not good at I don't know for some reason a lot of us I

148
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,720
feel like everyone in Bieler has such huge bangs we all have like humongous

149
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:36,280
bangs have you guys noticed that or maybe except for Azura like I feel like

150
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:44,200
Strani has huge bangs um let me pull up the actual model too so I don't have to

151
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,080
keep maybe I can look look at my own reference just referencing my own art

152
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,880
from my own hair Strani has huge bangs mercy has huge bangs I have humongous

153
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:10,360
bangs um I see has huge bangs too it's not the size that counts it's the motion

154
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:20,640
of the ocean all right and then I want to do I want to do this the little

155
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:30,640
braids oh yeah I see it yeah we all have huge bangs does she be have bangs

156
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:40,440
I'm trying to remember what she be say looks like it takes a long time to cross

157
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:49,800
the ocean in a row boat what who does your hair because I can my monitor just

158
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:57,120
died who does your hair because I can just get the same hair cut for $20

159
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:05,900
rude big bangs big forehead yeah that too like it kind of gives me a really big

160
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:14,560
which I guess you know is it really accurate though to have a big forehead

161
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:21,680
because apparently my my actual head is like really really small underneath it

162
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:28,960
right something like like to have the bumps I love floofy bangs like old

163
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:41,200
anime yeah I guess that's true it does kind of I'm not really um I didn't watch

164
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,800
a lot of old anime so I'm not really attached to like the old anime style you

165
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:53,400
know I didn't watch a lot of old anime cuz I wasn't I only got into anime when

166
00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:03,160
I was in like seventh grade I think so most of the anime I watched was not

167
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:09,720
battled I feel like I need to make this more angle

168
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:22,720
I mean half bald no just give me some time to give myself here and right yes

169
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,280
did I completely answer that I don't use a display tablet because I don't like

170
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:34,080

173
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:56,120
a crab something I think that's what it was oh god this is already looking bad

174
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:03,920
someone said I look like Wendy from Wendy's like the like the um maybe I

175
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:09,280
shouldn't make it them outwards like the fast food restaurant is that so wrong

176
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:17,320
is that so bad to look like Wendy's I think Wendy's cute another crabs treasure

177
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:27,640
yeah yeah yeah the mascot yeah the mascot from Wendy's you kind of do I'm I

178
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,440
don't think I do I mean I'm about to make myself look more like it but I don't

179
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:40,440
think I currently do are you gonna add freckles yes yes yes of course I'm

180
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:48,240
keeping my freckles and like I said before do not take this stream as like

181
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,000
an example of what the actual model will look like it's gonna look way cuter than

182
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,820
anything you see here okay I promise or at least the art itself will look cuter

183
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:05,000
maybe you won't like the design we'll see we'll see Wendy's approves round

184
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,380
eyebrows yes I love round eyebrows and you know what I'm gonna make them big

185
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:20,780

proud of you being jobless kind of sucks I can understand the struggle how did

189
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:04,540
they do this how did they make them look so cute because like when I had a job

190
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:11,940
like cuz technically I I didn't need to have a job but my mom really wanted me

191
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:21,020
to have one so you know I kind of had to be at her mercy and get a job and when I

192
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,500
did have a job she would be like don't you just love having money and and having

193
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,940
you know being able to buy what you want don't you just love it in my head I'm

194
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:38,020
like no because like yeah sure I guess I can buy what I want and I'm talking about

195
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:44,700
like a regular job like a like a I worked customer service and I was like

196
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,340
no because sure I could buy what I want if I could fucking leave my house at

197
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:55,860
any point other than to go to work because that's what I did I didn't leave

198
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:02,260
my house other than to go to work or to go to school like what am I supposed to

199
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,340

00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:27,260
other than have a job like outside of your job right relatable right like I

203
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:33,180
don't understand how people have like a full-time job and also like have hobbies

204
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:42,580
and go outside of their house and have friends I can't do that oh shit oh shit

235
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:15,320
a choker I just have a dent right up here that's my dent it's my headphone

240
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,280
hair wider too sorry I'm really picky this might be a really um stressful

241
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,240
stream to watch

242
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,200

244
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:37,160
it too wide now that's cute right I feel like maybe I kind of something inside of

245
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:42,280
me is telling me to flip these hair pieces so that they're facing outwards

246
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:59,560
like that you're the opposite of stressful really really I feel like I'm

247
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:05,600
very stressed especially when we play games together and I'm like what do I

248
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,760
do especially if it's like a horror game if it's a horror game and I'm like what

249
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,800
do I do tell me what to do please please please tell me what to do what do I do

253
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:47,520
about you okay good oh I do have some teal up I keep accidentally muting my

254
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:54,520
mic the rule of cool slash cute is why Mercy has a giant pair of scissors in

255
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:01,040
her skull also because of killer cool kill wait did you cool slash cute wait

256
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:14,240
what did you say something else I didn't I don't get it that's normal for me

257
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,320
being a person with three siblings oh good wait you have other siblings other

258
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:27,960
than me let me try your tea it's not good it's yucky I only like sweet teas

259
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:40,920
right wait I wanted a color I didn't really look up any colors to have I don't

260
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:47,640
know kind the rule of cool is allowing something silly because it's it looks

261
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:57,240
cool oh okay if it looks cool slash cute use it oh okay yeah that's a new level

262
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:06,120
of cheating having other siblings you thought you were the only one yes yes I'm

263
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:12,680
supposed to be the only one you have how dare you have other sisters other than

264
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:23,760
me okay I actually don't know what kind of color let me look up um let me look up

265
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:30,200
on Pinterest some collars and you can tell me if you like them or not okay

266
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,400
color like choker color

267
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
hmm

268
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:57,080
what if it's an older sister it doesn't matter there's only me only me a food

269
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:04,720
related color I'm not quite sure how I would do that

270
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,720
hmm

271
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:30,360
I like this one do you like this one how about that one hmm that's yay nay

272
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:36,360
hmm yes it means the best little sister in the world and she's the only girl I

273
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:44,080
needed in my life and I love her and what you like it you like it a bit simple

274
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,320
well the other the rest of the design is gonna be I feel like I'm gonna have a

275
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:57,200
lot it's gonna be a lot do you want to keep the Trinity not I don't know what

276
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,640
what is the truth

277
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:15,200
maybe I should keep the Trinity not not me not even knowing what's on my own

278
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:27,600
okay okay okay you know what no we'll keep the knot you're right what's behind

279
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:41,120
me she's right behind me isn't she she's staring at me from behind isn't she

280
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:55,520
I think what I'll do is I'll just make it like an actual little like a tiny

281
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,720
little pendant instead

282
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:15,360
like that except like more even and good in the actual design like I said don't

283
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,800
take this don't take this is what the model is actually gonna look like

284
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,960
there's something like that she's right behind me yeah we'll keep the knot in

285
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:44,280
don't worry we'll keep the knot maybe make it a little bigger the try not and

286
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,600
the pentagram was a placeholder now it's too lazy to come up with an original

287
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:53,160
design for an emblem at the time is the middle of summer don't judge me that's

288
00:40:53,160 --> 00:41:03,960
okay skin walker why do you have a Satanism taboo on your pelvis region

290
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:21,800

00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:59,760
something I really really really wanted to include but I'm not sure if we can do

297
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,440
it what I wanted to do is I wanted to have it so off the shoulder that you

00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:36,840
top of it like peeking through the top of the shirt but I know it might be

302
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:46,960
risking it I know I know it's it's it might be too much I know it would be so

318
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:51,280

359
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:22,020
they are but I'd never like personally in my own wardrobe I don't like to wear

360
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:25,420
them cuz I'm self-conscious so I'm not gonna be walking around with my tummy

361
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:32,100
out but in this case I'm gonna be walking around with my tummy out

362
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,900
oops there

363
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:49,980
like that I think that's cute I think I don't know alright pockets pockets some

364
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:59,620
some pockets understandable it is understandable I'm exposing my whole

365
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:10,940
in musty to the world my entire in musty all right great I also wanted a belly

366
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:18,340
button piercing where's my belly button I didn't draw in my belly button okay that

367
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:26,180
doesn't look on that anatomically correct all women's pockets are useless

368
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:33,300
okay is that how belly button piercings work I don't think that's correct

369
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:46,940
that's a good change reflex for the skate for that for the frills I like to

370
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,940
draw frills I like to draw a lot of frills frills are like one of my favorite

371
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:59,260
things to draw other than hair I like to draw a lot of hair too so but I don't

372
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:05,580
think it's a good change reflex at all I'm just trying to I'm just trying to get

373
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:12,300
the drawing get the design down so that way I can like actually make it good

374
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:22,820
when I'm alone you know I kind of want to bring the shirt down a little more

375
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:26,340
just a little more

376
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:37,820
as someone who has tried but absolutely cannot draw at all me this way to see

377
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:45,580
shut your mouth don't put yourself down like that everyone can draw even you

378
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:50,420
just some people have to you know practice more than others which sucks

379
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,620
but that's just how it is for everything unfortunately some people just kind of

380
00:52:54,620 --> 00:53:03,340
pick up stuff faster than others but you know everyone can do it you shut your

381
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:09,280
whore mouth I like doing hands okay yeah shut your

382
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:15,740
whore milk to hands get out of here with your stupid hands no one likes to do

383
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:22,020
hands that's not even AI can do

384
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:32,140
belly button hold small fluid inside belly what small fluid am I just stupid

385
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:42,580
today I found it really hard to draw your hair buns yeah that's something I

386
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:51,740
noticed like it's a little bit confusing from some artists maybe so that's why I

387
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:56,820
wanted to simplify it in this design it's just some cute rates

388
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:15,340
get out of here with your dirty mind none of my Christian Minecraft server

389
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:23,780
and I want to color this too okay yeah let me so let me just go look at women's

390
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:29,820
belly button piercings real quick so I can see what it's supposed to look like

391
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:38,460
my mom actually has a belly button piercing crazy in me lower so it's like

392
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:49,100
the top part of the belly button in order to draw hands you have to go live in

393
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:55,180
a cave and meditate for a cosmic revelation that's true that's how it

394
00:54:55,220 --> 00:55:00,740
feels like oh yeah and someone said they want me to have a septum piercing when I

395
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:10,140
asked for design ideas alright sorry our mom has a belly button piercing isn't

396
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:21,420
that crazy yeah someone said they want me to draw a septum piercing but I feel

397
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:29,100
like this is not correct belly button piercing way and then maybe like a

398
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:36,740
little upside down cross I'm not sure if I'll keep it I'm not sure I love my

399
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:44,340
immobile sister thank you I love you too something like that

400
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:57,380

401
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:04,180
thoughts and prayers it's cute okay okay and then here I'll draw the split tongue

402
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:18,740
too look small hmm I think it's a good size I think making it bigger would be

403
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:24,340
too big left sleeve needs to go down a bit oh you're right you're right you're

404
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,300
right if something is oversized like this it should be like not oversized if

405
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:33,580
something's off the shoulder like this it should be like off the shoulder right

406
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:38,300
more maybe I'll make this one up more

407
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,660

408
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:56,180

428
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:17,140
split tongues right now split tongue I heard that if you actually split your

429
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:23,100
tongue it's like not a good idea oh it gets like really split yeah oh my god

430
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:28,740
the tongue I see you I see oh you can see inside some of them

431
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:36,900
why are you acting so gay the one thing you have for sure stolen is all our

432
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:43,020
hearts oh thank you for the tip you're right I did steal your heart I'll admit

433
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:47,260
to that I'll admit to that but you still mind too so it's okay it's a fair

434
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:58,180
okay wow these pictures are so disgusting um yeah okay okay I'll um I

435
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:09,220
guess it goes pretty deep like that and then I'll put a little heart at the top

436
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:16,580
little heart piercing flight tongues you have to completely relearn to talk and

437
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:19,820
eat basically anything mouth related but if you have good muscle control you

438
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:24,300
can wiggle them independently that sounds like an awful trade-off oops I

439
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:31,100
wouldn't do this in real life but you know in um

440
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:40,060
there's my sweet tongue in anime whatever who cares it's anime

441
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:53,380
why teeth versus why shape tongue why teeth yeah it's a bad idea I will be

442
01:00:53,380 --> 01:01:03,900
doing it IRL just just just in this drawing um I keep forgetting all right

443
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:13,780
I want to have like um mesh sleeves we're emo right so like let's let's make

444
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:27,540
some mesh sleeves and then just mash them up and have them go like all the

445
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:45,420
way up I have to say this but ton looks like a bit much we'll see I know um like

446
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:50,220
you know not everything might not everything here will look good together

447
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:56,460
right now but I hope that when I draw myself it will look better and if there's

448
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:01,740
anything you guys don't like you can like you can comment it on um I'll post

487
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:20,140
fucking hanging out of this there's yeah exactly there's no gust of winds on

488
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:28,700
the internet to worry about um this is my idea board okay so I'm really

489
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:33,420
conflicted on what kind of socks and what kind of shoes should I have one like

490
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:38,180
warmers that's stupid looking what design on the pants you haven't thought

491
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:48,020
about that change it to a v-strake I'm not trying to get kicked off of you too

492
01:07:55,940 --> 01:08:04,140
unless you fart again that's actually such a cute little um that's a that's a

493
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:09,620
cute little visual for me just tooting and and my little skirt just flies up a

494
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:23,460
little bit okay I'm going to I'm gonna steal this shoe I'm gonna steal this

495
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:32,660
shoe I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with it I haven't decided that yet have a

496
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:38,260
sticker instead of pencil diabolical

497
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:42,420
is that right

498
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,420
really bad

499
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:54,260
this is why I don't do art streams because I need to focus I'm so bad at

500
01:08:54,260 --> 01:09:01,780
focusing on why aren't my feet fitting into the shoe

501
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:10,500
it still looks really big whatever it's okay it's okay is that our shoe too yes

502
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:21,460
stir-fish notes or socks but open on okay I'll look up what's there let me

503
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:24,140
look it up myself

504
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:37,900
open on the heel is that what I mean is that what you mean but I'm not showing

505
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:45,940
my feet though compression shoes I'm getting old your little sister has to

506
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:57,020
start wearing compression socks um yeah I think I'll if they're leg warmers they

507
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:05,580
would be like on top of the shoes so like like like like this

508
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:18,380
I'm like awfully drawn but like you know fold it on top of the shoes

509
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:22,020
something like that

510
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:30,980
some big dot stompers might be nice true but I don't want to I don't know I don't

511
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:36,700
I'll kind of attached to your shoes I don't really want to get rid of them you

512
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:40,860
know I'm already getting rid of the sweater

513
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:49,220
so I feel kind of like oh maybe I could have like a I don't want to bring this

514
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:56,660
all the way up maybe I could have like a like a band-aid kind of like what's

515
01:10:56,660 --> 01:11:06,500
going on here take my Tim's instead do we only own one pair well it's the

516
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:13,220
fucking ones you died in so yes they mean they mean something to me okay they

517
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:21,260
have meaning to them and then I'll just quickly trace these shoes

518
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:36,820
they look like sketchers like light up stompy sketchers it's our other pair

519
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:43,140
shoes would be disproportional since you already have a short-sleeved

520
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:53,300
and grip t-shirt what's a Zetai real real key

521
01:11:54,540 --> 01:12:02,460
Zetai real what's that

522
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:17,300
what does that mean what did you do to our dead party after we die oh my god

523
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:25,180
nothing I buried it I buried it don't worry don't worry I promise I buried it

524
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:31,220
your sweater on the other hand I can't say the same thing I can't say I did

525
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:39,660
nothing to that one bro I was so surprised once Johnny told me the back

526
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:44,580
story behind the fucking sweater and shit I was like nah nah you just pulled

527
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:47,940
that out of your ass right now there's no way that actually was planned cuz what

528
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:59,580
the fuck I'm not telling you what it is cuz it's like what like what made you

529
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:03,580
think of that where where did this come from

530
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:17,340
rigor mortis is great for long-lasting that's so fucking dark oh my god no no

531
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:28,260
no if your erection lasts more than four hours please please seek medical

532
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:34,700
assistance that's what that mean we think of

533
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:46,620
terribly terribly traced shoes but yeah look why does it look oh it's cuz my feet

534
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:50,820
are still inside of my shoes let me let me erase my feet

535
01:13:57,140 --> 01:14:04,340
there we go that looks kind of stupid doesn't it

536
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:11,540
Johnny's mind is scary yeah don't tell us what you did to everybody I won't tell

537
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:20,940
you do the shoes light up that would be so cute oh my god like having um having

538
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:25,940
like a stomping animation and have the shoes light up that'd be really cute

539
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:38,620
maybe I should do that I think it looks off I kind of agree

540
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:49,180
but I'm not sure oh maybe I just drew the shoe badly I forgot I left out like

541
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:55,140
the details maybe if I add more details it'll look better

542
01:14:55,140 --> 01:15:11,740
blink-do what's blink-do blink-do I'll think about lighting up the

543
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:27,940
sketchers because I think that's a really cute idea is that look better no I

544
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:38,700
think that still looks bad the leg warmers don't go far enough down hmm maybe

545
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:51,980
you're right I'll try to make them go far further down like like that

546
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:03,780
does that look better thank you for helping me by the way I absolutely

547
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:11,180
appreciate any um any back seating when it comes to when I'm confused in art

548
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:18,020
I think that looks a little better

549
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:28,620
make them light up really that looks great oh sorry I didn't show the whole

550
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:39,300
thing way better okay okay okay okay and then I'm just gonna um copy and paste it

551
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,820
to the other one

552
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:49,420
I love loose socks me too

553
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:54,380
there we go

554
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:11,660
oh it looks so cute new laurel dropped bro died from a tragic wheelie you you

555
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:15,340
were wearing airpods and you didn't hear me when I was yelling at you that you're

556
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:23,420
wheeling into traffic no and then I kind of like the band-aid uh I mean I know

557
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:27,620
this isn't a band-aid it's probably a sock but like I kind of have a mercy

558
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:30,900
I don't want to I don't want to get too close to her design

559
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:44,980
um maybe I'll just like maybe I'll have them even and then just put them like uh

560
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,860
what's it called more mesh up here

561
01:17:55,940 --> 01:18:00,740
we got hit by truck you get you got you sick hide

562
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:08,580

564
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:24,020

568
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:59,300
to make them colorful here make make band aids more colorful because I think that's a good idea

569
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:10,660
you followed us into the isekai relosis or did you rip us out of the east I did not follow you

570

579
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:29,540
um I already have something on this like so I'm gonna add it on this like should I do like this

580
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:39,780
thing or should I do like a heart or something like tattoo oh my god it's like I went to jail

581
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:42,420
or something a tattoo

582
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,500
could have tied it around your wrist

583
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:54,020
I do want to have some sort of like magical looking design incorporated too

584
01:20:54,980 --> 01:21:04,100
I do want to make that try a heart I think I might add like some crystals to the bandaid you know

585
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:14,340
this is an awful heart what the fuck

586
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:25,700
there

587
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:34,740
oh a skull a skull is a good idea too

588
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:39,860
oh this heart is too

589
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:50,660
it's a little bit too far out okay there

590
01:21:56,820 --> 01:22:00,260
and then have the dots because it's a

591
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:04,580
because it's a belt

592
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:14,180
I feel like I look so basic give one of those mom tattoos but it says

593
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:18,660
bro instead no

594
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:22,100
and a heart on the other

595
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:31,140
okay um I need like a simple skull reference

596
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:38,580
I think having two is too much but I think I'll just keep the skull

597
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:42,980
I think on both legs is too much

598
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:50,260
you know what I mean I really like I really like this

599
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:58,420
oh no why isn't it copying copy image oh these stupid fucking websites

600
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,460
okay well I'll just try it myself

601
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:08,100
yeah keep the asymmetrical yeah I feel like both sides is too much but I think I'm going to change

602
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:12,020
this to a skull like uh

603
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:21,940
this is going to be so stupid looking like that that's kind of cute

604
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:30,740

636
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:16,260

639
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,820

I'm close to

643
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:05,940
there and then all of it needs to be even smaller

644
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:10,340
and then the leaves

645
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:23,220

don't pee on me

648
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:42,180
if you if you angle it a bit I'm close make sense

649
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:51,140
you know maybe I guess since it is technically you know

650
01:28:51,140 --> 01:29:02,340
um

651
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:18,340
does that work are you sure

652
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:27,300
like that like if I really rip it up

653
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:40,740
don't piss me off I feel like it's too it's too um angled at that point you know

654
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:44,340
like it's too angled

655
01:29:51,460 --> 01:30:01,300
you like it you want I'm close don't piss me off I'm close is that what you want

656
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:09,540
I know it's the same angle as the neckline but I don't know if it looks good

657
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:11,620
that's what you want

658
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:17,940
skew it to match the folding I can't free transform like that on

659
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:24,660
I need to go on cliff studio paint for that but I'll make it look good on the original

660
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:34,900
don't listen to us it's really funny but this is what I want okay I'll listen to you

01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:44,260
um

664
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:49,540
I think we can color it now right

665
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:54,100
I think we can color it

666
01:30:57,060 --> 01:31:02,740
let me just erase my body um in the parts where they're not supposed to be

667
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:12,740
so

668
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:27,940
it's cute and funny add the two but only the top of it so it looks like it's actually ripped

669
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:34,260
I'll just

670
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:47,380

676
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:35,780
a cheek tattoo like a little pumpkin

677
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:42,660

746
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:57,220
I didn't actually expect to like any of these glasses this one's kind of cute

747
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:12,260
let's do this let's also do this

748
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:20,260
um

749
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:34,260
there super cute make them bigger okay let me finish actually drawing them and then I'll make them bigger

750
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:42,580
and then they have a little dot in the middle

751
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:47,860
oh I can't fucking see there we go

752
01:42:55,540 --> 01:43:00,820
the glasses with the strap that prevent them do you want me to be a hag I feel like that's

753
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:10,900
very old person needle we have hags in the company it's not me I feel like that would make me look older

754
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:14,420
you know what I mean

755
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:23,700
an eyepatch to hide her demon eye to hide my sharring gun

756
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:42,900
I love my little sister I love you too

757
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:51,620
black dot left ones why why would I do that two eyepatches how am I supposed to see

758
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:53,860
you're just drawing me at this point

759
01:43:58,740 --> 01:43:59,060
there

760
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:09,140
I feel like these glasses are really big though maybe if I dried in my maybe once I dried in

761
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:11,060
my own style it'll look better

762
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:23,940
you don't need to see only listen to our voice that's kind of cute why is that kind of cute

763
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:25,380
very cute

764
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:39,940
big is cute makes you look smaller okay okay okay that um let me actually continue the art

765
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:41,540
not the art but the

766
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:48,740
the coloring and maybe make this a little darker too

767
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:53,140
but then it's harder to see the blood

768
01:44:56,740 --> 01:45:00,420
looks like you're wearing your brother's glasses when they don't fit you really

769
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:01,860
okay well if you like that

770
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:06,180
and then my skin

771
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:10,660
and

772
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:14,420
just gonna

773
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:22,020
and I uh I don't think the selection tool will work because my sketch is too messy

774
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:24,980
well maybe uh not really

775
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:30,020
are you shitting me

776
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:42,020
the size selection thing is so annoying

777
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:48,020
does this work oh I forgot to paint my nails too

778
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:51,620
good enough for me

779
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:08,660
everything Amy wears originally belonged to us yeah yeah this cute little mini skirt was yours

780
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:15,940

I hope the prescription is is the same I don't know what's your prescription

784
01:46:41,860 --> 01:46:44,980
I think I don't think everyone here's even wears glasses though

785
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,500
I don't know

786
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:51,940
I want don't worry I won't I won't

787
01:46:58,180 --> 01:46:59,140
like you might

788
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:06,900
I wouldn't mind I wouldn't mind but I'm still gonna tease you about it if you do do that

789
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:09,460
because I think it's funny

790
01:47:09,620 --> 01:47:16,740
okay after I'm done with the skin I'll I'll redraw the

791
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:20,580
the black nail polish

792
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:32,660
negative 2.5 left negative 2.75 oh that's nothing

793
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:38,820
onion stronger onion stronger prescription than that that's nothing

the people's girlfriend

798
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:23,220
isn't normal to know your own prescription because I have no clue what mine is

799
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:27,700
no you don't have to know it it's not that big of a deal as long as your um

800
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:33,540
um you know as long as your eye doctor knows that then it's okay

801
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:37,380
can't spell in me without my yeah go on

802
01:48:44,180 --> 01:48:51,860
hive minding I'm gonna change my thong to black because this looks a little bit

803
01:48:51,860 --> 01:48:56,580
I don't know this reminds me of like I don't know this looks like a cowboy thong

804
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:06,260
it's just it's giving cowboy thong and um I am not a cowboy so I'm good

805
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:14,180
and here here it's giving like assless chaps you know

806
01:49:16,820 --> 01:49:19,540
tanned leather thong yeah that's what it reminds me of

807
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:26,740
so I was just thinking like that sounds like it would hurt

808
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:31,220
and also I'm gonna make my hair a little bit more

809
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:39,940
a little bit more we're gonna do a bleach and tone here just a little just a little bleach and

810
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:46,500
tone just a little just just tone it a little bit

811
01:49:48,980 --> 01:49:55,220
I still want it to be bright blonde but I don't want it to be like as bright because we're emo now

812
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:04,820
you can cowgirl if you want don't some of the people in here have mercies oh she mark

818
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:53,940
she's not alive so they're getting rowdy in the cage yeah apparently

819
01:50:54,580 --> 01:50:58,100
they're getting a little thirsty for their little sister

820
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:04,900

823
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:26,260
I'll shut my mouth I won't tell her a thing

824
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:33,300
I need it for a spell

825
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:38,020
CBT Tuesday

826
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:44,420
also I kind of wanted to

827
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:56,500
I kind of liked these sleeves I don't know maybe I'll have some red on the stripes on the socks

828
01:51:56,500 --> 01:52:02,260
I wanted to incorporate like the red more I don't want to only be black and white

829
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:03,700
you know

830
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:06,740
and maybe on the

831
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:10,500
on the bandaid too

832
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:15,060
have my sack ma'am thank you

833
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:22,020
I'll steal them in your sleep you're gonna wake up and you're gonna you're gonna feel some emptiness down there

834
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:27,380
but that's okay because you don't need them anyways

835
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:37,460
I'll keep the same eye color maybe make it a little less bright

836
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:48,100
I'm personally I personally feel like this this the brightness wouldn't really go well with this

837
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:56,260
design because it's so like you know emo so we gotta mute the tones a little bit here

838
01:53:02,660 --> 01:53:12,260
I'm gonna put the X

839
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:22,260
so

840
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:34,260
there there's a terrible X I did what I could very thoughtful I know I am very thoughtful

841
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:37,300
I'll do it when you can't feel it so that way you don't have to scream in pain

842
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:44,020
Elden Ring playthrough would you want to watch watch me play Elden Ring

843
01:53:44,020 --> 01:53:47,300
oh my god I'm actually really liking this design now that I look at it it's really cute

844
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:58,260
what is color theory at this point anyways I don't know

845
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:04,500
like if you want something to pop you can surround it by muted colors but um

846
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:12,500
we're emo we don't want anything to to pop out if you play I'll watch have you played a souls

847
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:20,340
game before no people keep recommending them to me for some reason even though I've made it pretty

848
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:25,540
clear like I'm not really a gamer so anything you recommend to me I'm gonna have a lot of

849
01:54:25,540 --> 01:54:29,780
trouble playing but if you're willing to watch me struggle that's okay

850
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:35,460
as long as you're there to tell me what to do

851
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:39,460
also what are your opinions on adding a different hair color like adding some streets

852
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:45,460
would you want that I feel like it'll add to the emo-ness are you okay with that

853
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:53,540
I'm not sure a lot I'm sure a lot of people watch you can't sit through souls like

854
01:54:54,500 --> 01:55:00,820
it is easily a tricky game I'm tired of every vtuber playing souls stop

855
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:06,020
should I beat the one exception and not play souls then

856
01:55:07,780 --> 01:55:11,620
do they all really play souls games well there's probably a reason it's probably

857
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:17,300
because they're popular a rat tail break ew what the fuck no I'm talking like the different hair

858
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:25,460
color you know red streak pink could be nice maybe purple to match my eyes

859
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:32,580
I'll I'll think about it after I add um

860
01:55:35,380 --> 01:55:36,900
after I add the rest of the colors

861
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:40,260
can I

862
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:52,100
purple would be nice add purple

863
01:55:52,740 --> 01:55:57,140
Esteban in your pocket I was debating on adding some rats in here

864
01:55:59,140 --> 01:56:00,100
I just feel like

865
01:56:00,340 --> 01:56:04,100
I don't know it's a lot of work

866
01:56:05,060 --> 01:56:09,300
it's a lot of extra work for me to draw and also a lot of extra work for the raker

867
01:56:10,420 --> 01:56:13,140
and I'm kind of lazy you know

868
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:19,860
would you want a rat I probably wouldn't be able to include all of them

869
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:26,100
and also it'd be really it'd be really extra depressing if they fucking die you know

870
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:35,380
I like the orange black purple and red side by side purple streaks

871
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:42,900
you want Esteban

872
01:56:43,860 --> 01:56:56,100
I don't need to worry about the cost but I also just need to worry about like how much

873
01:56:57,700 --> 01:57:05,460
like how much I can I can draw you know the cost isn't as big of a deal it's more how much I can

874
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:09,140
I can make myself draw if that makes sense

875
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:14,900
I uh because I want it to be something I can do like

876
01:57:16,180 --> 01:57:20,660
you know without too much stress in about it oops I forgot that I'm

877
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:28,340
that I'm using the reflect tool

878
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:34,820
do Dennis he's the most lore accurate

879
01:57:36,980 --> 01:57:43,140
Dennis is a girl don't misgender my rat I could do Dennis

880
01:57:46,980 --> 01:57:51,940
an unnamed rat no if I add a rat it needs to be named it needs to be one of my name

881
01:57:52,580 --> 01:57:58,580
or apex wait you want me to play apex if she played valorant I'd go crazy

882
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:03,140
you'd go crazy with like rage watching me fail

883
01:58:08,260 --> 01:58:11,700
maybe save it for a possible future upgrade on the model

884
01:58:12,980 --> 01:58:13,940
that's a good idea

885
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:23,220
all right what color oh yeah I wanted to I wanted to have red and black socks

886
01:58:27,140 --> 01:58:28,980
red and black scraped socks

887
01:58:35,140 --> 01:58:40,260
I feel like I feel like the shirt isn't dark enough maybe I'm just going crazy

888
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:43,940
yeah it's okay for now

889
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:50,100
I'm a little bit cuckoo cuckoo puffs cuckoo puffs

890
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:58,980
FPS might be a bitch might be a bitch much I've never played um I think I played valorant

891
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:05,460
I think I played valorant once I don't really play FPS but when I was a kid I used to be

892
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:12,420
obsessed with this one FPS game it was an iPhone game and it was called battle bears are there any

893
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:19,300
previous battle bear players in here I don't think it was a very popular game but it was like a

894
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:27,940
little iPhone game and um it was a little shooter and I really loved but I really loved it I was

895
01:59:28,020 --> 01:59:29,860
really obsessed with winning that game

896
01:59:32,660 --> 01:59:37,460
was this synopsis it's literally just a shooter but instead of like like an FPS

897
01:59:39,460 --> 01:59:43,620
but you know all of the characters are just bears like teddy bears and stuff

898
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:49,460
it seems like some of you know did you guys play battle bears

899
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:54,340
I'll break do I want to make this

900
01:59:58,420 --> 02:00:05,620
nope hated the chainsaw motherfucker bro the chainsaw guy could like kill you in one hit

901
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:13,300
I liked him I like to play him but I hated when other people would play him that was my grape

902
02:00:21,220 --> 02:00:25,220
I did when I was young battle bear stream I don't think it exists anymore

903
02:00:25,940 --> 02:00:27,780
and if it does exist no one plays it

904
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:35,060
maybe I should do purple instead of red

905
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:39,380
but I need something to tie in the red pins

906
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:42,980
or should I make the pins black

907
02:00:43,460 --> 02:00:53,140
I never heard of it right red would be better bright red

908
02:01:07,540 --> 02:01:11,220
I don't know what are your thoughts on making the pins black

909
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:14,180
I don't know

910
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:19,860
what about gray

911
02:01:26,020 --> 02:01:26,980
maybe a lighter gray

912
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:32,740
I kind of like gray

913
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:39,380
could be a darker red I think you're right I think a darker red would look better

914
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:47,940
I also feel like I need to make them bigger and move them

915
02:01:58,900 --> 02:02:04,180
if you want to go red the skirt needs to be different yeah maybe you're right

916
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:10,900
maybe you're right because I feel like red and blue don't really look great together

917
02:02:13,380 --> 02:02:25,140
I think that looks okay gray looks good there's no pink anywhere

918
02:02:25,140 --> 02:02:27,460
well did I say that I would add pink anywhere

919
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:33,140
silver

920
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:38,420
silver what

921
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:44,020
change skirt color you don't know is something wrong does something look off

922
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:49,460
pink thong maybe that's a good idea actually

923
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:54,500
I need to name like my layers more

924
02:02:56,500 --> 02:03:01,380
maybe maybe a bright pink thong it would look kind of corny though

925
02:03:03,380 --> 02:03:04,820
it would look a little tacky

926
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:13,220
I don't know do you like that

927
02:03:16,340 --> 02:03:20,340
and maybe I can make the pins pink too

928
02:03:32,180 --> 02:03:37,220
like that I kind of like that I vote for black

929
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:44,820
yeah it does stand out more pink and blue look good together not but not but not blue and

930
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:52,260
but not red and pink ah fuck me pink and blue look good together but not red and blue I feel like

931
02:03:54,340 --> 02:03:59,220
here I can I'll make a poll for the thong color

932
02:04:01,300 --> 02:04:07,220
I'll make a poll for my my thong cover okay not color color thong color um start a poll

933
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:18,260
these are the important questions okay what color thong pink black okay start poll

934
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:27,860
okay which which color do you want let me know

935
02:04:28,020 --> 02:04:36,580
I see it's like pink is winning okay pink one oh or maybe not oh no it's going down now

936
02:04:38,820 --> 02:04:45,220
can we add red to the thong no because the thong because like this is this this is a gene

937
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:50,340
this is a gene skirt and I feel like red and blue don't look good close together so I don't

938
02:04:50,340 --> 02:04:57,140
want to make the thong red both pink face with black rim um

939
02:04:59,780 --> 02:05:01,940
yeah I guess that's basically what's happening here

940
02:05:05,860 --> 02:05:09,220
okay pink is winning I'll end the poll

941
02:05:12,980 --> 02:05:16,180
the pink would make it pop more I agree I agree I agree

942
02:05:17,140 --> 02:05:21,220
yeah choose correctly heretics

943
02:05:23,380 --> 02:05:29,300
and it does match my eyes you're right okay um then I think I might make your

944
02:05:32,020 --> 02:05:37,380
I might make your shoes like white and black or should I make them pink too

945
02:05:40,340 --> 02:05:45,540
what happens if you shirt with the thong well I guess it's just gonna fall down out of my skirt

946
02:05:47,140 --> 02:05:48,900
no I'm not doing neon green

947
02:06:00,740 --> 02:06:05,300
I think I'll try doing pink and white for the shoes

948
02:06:08,980 --> 02:06:12,980
no

949
02:06:13,940 --> 02:06:24,420
what are shoes really be pink I guess not I guess not well I dyed them pink okay

950
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:28,340
I recolored them for you

951
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:34,420
fine I'll see what red how red looks with the shoes

952
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:42,820
and if I don't like them I think I'll have to change them

953
02:06:47,380 --> 02:06:54,180
yeah I just used a sharpie to color them black I mean yeah or pink I just used a sharpie to

954
02:06:54,180 --> 02:07:00,740
color them that's all and then this is white

955
02:07:01,300 --> 02:07:04,660
is this yeah okay

956
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:12,980
why wouldn't they be pink if you're also wearing our thong you're right you did say you wanted

957
02:07:12,980 --> 02:07:19,380
to have a magical girl sub theme yeah if you can think of like

958
02:07:20,980 --> 02:07:24,340
ways to make it more magical not magical but like um

959
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:27,220
like

960
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:36,900
like like I do magic basically add some magic elements but not magical girl

961
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:42,340
because that makes it sound like an actual magical girl which I'm not aiming for

962
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:54,100
you're so sweet what oh good night good night have a have a good more witchy yeah more witchy

963
02:07:54,500 --> 02:08:01,700
if you have any way to make it more witchy okay yeah the red doesn't the red is the red

964
02:08:01,700 --> 02:08:10,900
isn't looking right to me I think Amy being a magical girl villain character is worth its own

965
02:08:10,900 --> 02:08:20,820
concept yeah that's true yeah a cult a cult like that yeah the red doesn't match she right okay let me just

966
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:26,340
I just uh I just bleached

967
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:35,540
where's pink I just bleached your shoes it's okay you don't mind do you

968
02:08:37,860 --> 02:08:40,100
actually I'm not sure if I like pink either

969
02:08:42,420 --> 02:08:45,300
black and red with pink strings would look good you're right

970
02:08:47,460 --> 02:08:48,580
you're right it would

971
02:08:51,620 --> 02:08:55,300
not completely black but

972
02:08:57,940 --> 02:09:01,460
like that and then wait here

973
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:06,260
and then make those strings pink

974
02:09:09,380 --> 02:09:13,140
yeah I'm never giving them back to you anyway so I can do whatever I want with them

975
02:09:13,540 --> 02:09:20,020

1005
02:13:02,100 --> 02:13:05,460
I feel like I'm making the strands look really bad that's my own fault

1006
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:16,420
I don't think I like the strands yeah it might be too much

1007
02:13:16,980 --> 02:13:22,820
I don't think I like the side pieces pink either though I think I'll just leave it at that yeah

1008
02:13:24,900 --> 02:13:31,940
a hair clip that's pink I wanted to incorporate these hair clips maybe instead of bozo make them

1009
02:13:31,940 --> 02:13:37,780
these hair clips what do you think about that but that's too much pink in one area

1010
02:13:41,620 --> 02:13:43,620
yeah I'll try not to overdo the pink

1011
02:13:47,380 --> 02:13:55,460
I like the black ribbons I like them too that's a problem

1012
02:13:57,540 --> 02:14:02,180
okay um let's color the band-aids

1013
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:07,060
real quick maybe I can do like um

1014
02:14:10,660 --> 02:14:15,860
like a bright blue band-aid here six out of ten that one was that one was crispy

1015
02:14:16,580 --> 02:14:17,460
that one was nice

1016
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:23,220
I don't think blue looks good

1017
02:14:27,380 --> 02:14:31,460
does that look good do you like blue pink band-aid

1018
02:14:33,380 --> 02:14:36,420
I think pink would be a little bit too close to my skin color

1019
02:14:39,460 --> 02:14:40,900
do you like pink band-aid more

1020
02:14:41,300 --> 02:14:48,020
you like the band-aid I have now should I just make it like I guess the band-aid I have now

1021
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:49,620
is pretty close to my skin color too

1022
02:14:56,900 --> 02:15:00,980
regular band-aid the same one as you currently have

1023
02:15:03,460 --> 02:15:05,140

1029
02:15:47,540 --> 02:16:00,820

1041
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:18,580

1043
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:28,500

1046
02:17:45,860 --> 02:17:51,780

1047
02:17:51,860 --> 02:17:58,740
oh yeah candy bracelets okay let me look up some reference for what I um what that would look like

1048
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:13,140
okay so they're just like a bunch of different colored um beads right

1049
02:18:13,620 --> 02:18:25,380
is that it don't piss me off I'm close it it might be a little too much

1050
02:18:26,100 --> 02:18:29,540
oh something I also wanted to do was to have um

1051
02:18:39,220 --> 02:18:40,820
I want to have some rips here

1052
02:18:43,460 --> 02:18:49,700
I want to have some rips in the in the why can't I draw hello oh

1053
02:18:59,780 --> 02:19:05,780
does that look bad I kind of like the rip to look you could do a candy bracelet made out of

1054
02:19:05,780 --> 02:19:11,300
bone dice for the occult feel

1055
02:19:13,700 --> 02:19:16,900
you look like an emo wannabe middle schooler and I'm into it

1056
02:19:20,580 --> 02:19:22,740
I really like the gradient hair that's good

1057
02:19:24,820 --> 02:19:31,700
yeah rips are a good touch I like rips I'll probably like I'll probably add more rips um

1058
02:19:31,700 --> 02:19:35,060
um once I make the

1059
02:19:40,980 --> 02:19:44,340
once I make the actual design but there have some rips

1060
02:19:50,580 --> 02:19:54,740
but we've pivoted back into little sister territory that's good a wallet chain

1061
02:19:55,380 --> 02:19:57,780
I could add the book

1062
02:19:59,780 --> 02:20:05,460
on the other side do you think I should add the book I could change how the book looks I could

1063
02:20:05,460 --> 02:20:13,860
make it an emo book I can make it look come on how do I super I don't know if I have those

1079
02:22:27,460 --> 02:22:34,020
it looks dope I know it does and you were you were doubting me

1080
02:22:36,260 --> 02:22:44,980

1081
02:22:45,460 --> 02:22:47,220
oh

1082
02:22:54,260 --> 02:23:00,820
yes it does fit well I just have to figure out a good way to strap it to myself

1083
02:23:04,020 --> 02:23:10,980
like okay this is gonna be a really bad like drawing of it but I'm trying

1084
02:23:11,540 --> 02:23:13,540
I'm trying

1085
02:23:17,620 --> 02:23:23,860
well I'm not trying hard enough but you know I will try when the time comes we're just trying to get

1086
02:23:23,860 --> 02:23:34,180
the design now um okay so this is the backing so it shouldn't have any color just the book bind

1087
02:23:34,900 --> 02:23:42,660
and then inside it should be like the colors here maybe a little darker

1088
02:23:51,060 --> 02:23:59,540
maybe bigger a little overly detailed yeah I'll probably end up I'll probably end up simplifying it

1089
02:23:59,620 --> 02:24:00,420
um

1090
02:24:02,580 --> 02:24:04,500
just because it is um

1091
02:24:08,980 --> 02:24:15,140
it is very detailed you're right and also I'll make a better version of it

1092
02:24:16,580 --> 02:24:22,900
I'll add a better version of it I promise nail it to the left but this thing is on the left

1093
02:24:25,460 --> 02:24:27,540
I'm just flipping it to my other side

1094
02:24:30,260 --> 02:24:34,580
like that no it's from the top

1095
02:24:38,980 --> 02:24:46,660
like that hammer it with hammer it in with the nail no I don't like pain that much

1096
02:24:47,460 --> 02:24:51,620
maybe if you do it okay there

1097
02:24:52,260 --> 02:24:58,820
a really shitty version

1098
02:25:03,380 --> 02:25:08,900
do you want hammer or nails in the design still I don't think I want the hammer I don't think the

1099
02:25:08,900 --> 02:25:17,700
hammer would fit it could perhaps be tucked under the skull belt it looks a little less busy

1100
02:25:18,660 --> 02:25:20,100
under the skull belt

1101
02:25:24,020 --> 02:25:24,980
I'm confused

1102
02:25:27,540 --> 02:25:28,820
yeah it's some contrast

1103
02:25:33,620 --> 02:25:34,820
maybe more pins

1104
02:25:39,620 --> 02:25:43,620
are you saying you want nails in the design still is that what you mean

1105
02:25:44,580 --> 02:25:49,460
a ghost of us floating around you

1106
02:25:51,700 --> 02:25:55,220
are you asking me to draw like the pin pals um

1107
02:25:57,060 --> 02:26:03,300
like the the the pin pals um oh sorry my mind is going blank

1108
02:26:05,460 --> 02:26:09,860
like the fuck what's the word yes

1109
02:26:14,180 --> 02:26:23,700
the skull belt on the thigh could be part of a book holster uh that's a really big book though

1110
02:26:23,700 --> 02:26:31,460
to be put on my thigh right yeah mascot you want a math you want the mascot too but like a ghost

1111
02:26:36,260 --> 02:26:41,380
is that what you mean you summoned us as a spoopy ghost that floats around

1112
02:26:44,580 --> 02:26:51,460
I don't think I'm gonna include like actual lower accurate me chan here

1113
02:26:54,980 --> 02:26:57,300
oh here I thought of an idea actually

1114
02:27:02,100 --> 02:27:09,300
um

1115
02:27:14,420 --> 02:27:19,940
um never mind never mind I was gonna say I could put the nails in my head instead of the pins but

1116
02:27:19,940 --> 02:27:27,940
I uh Dr. Nova E from before me I already has that and I don't want to I don't want to copy that um

1117
02:27:30,740 --> 02:27:38,340
on the book cover you and the mascot but I like this design I'm not gonna that's gonna make it look

1118
02:27:38,340 --> 02:27:46,420
silly I think um if you need something smaller than a book there's always a turret deck yeah but

1119
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:55,060
the book has meaning you know to the lore so I feel like I should um keep it as a book but just

1120
02:27:55,060 --> 02:28:00,580
like change change it a little bit why am I so bad at like

1121
02:28:05,700 --> 02:28:06,660
am I doing this right

1122
02:28:08,900 --> 02:28:14,340
whatever tummy mouth with a split tongue what's a tiny what's a tummy mouth

1123
02:28:18,740 --> 02:28:23,860
I think adding more stuff might clamor it up clamor it up you mean like make it too busy

1124
02:28:25,380 --> 02:28:31,380
are we the ghost on each hand or the mascot you're both

1125
02:28:32,820 --> 02:28:36,900
I could I could add a little ghost mascot but I don't think I'm gonna do that now just because

1126
02:28:36,900 --> 02:28:43,860
I'm getting really hot and sweaty so I think this will be here I'll make the tongue bigger

1127
02:28:43,860 --> 02:28:50,180
I think this will be our design for now and I'm I might add a little more um

1128
02:28:50,340 --> 02:28:52,340
um

1129
02:28:53,860 --> 02:28:58,340
where's the tongue I might add like a few more smaller details myself but

1130
02:28:59,060 --> 02:29:04,020
this is like the main point and you made it with me so that makes it special

1131
02:29:06,660 --> 02:29:09,860
there and let me delete this list up here

1132
02:29:10,180 --> 02:29:18,980
and maybe also color in the tongue what color is my tongue

1133
02:29:29,380 --> 02:29:29,700
there

1134
02:29:29,860 --> 02:29:38,500
there's my beautiful split tongue you're not ready for it

1135
02:29:40,180 --> 02:29:44,900
should I add stitches to it or is that too much is that not sexy

1136
02:29:46,660 --> 02:29:48,340
can you tell me if that's not sexy

1137
02:29:51,940 --> 02:29:55,860
do you like that what are your thoughts on that

1138
02:30:00,580 --> 02:30:05,220
I'm not making my tongue green yes the stitches no two stitches hot looks weird

1139
02:30:06,260 --> 02:30:12,580
you don't know too much no stitches out I was asking for a split tongue me I am

1140
02:30:14,260 --> 02:30:17,300
like plushie tongue not for me okay

1141
02:30:20,420 --> 02:30:25,620
weird it's weird I think it's kind of hot I have no thoughts on that imagine if it falls apart

1142
02:30:25,700 --> 02:30:30,340
no okay it seems like most people are saying no okay I won't add stitches I'll just keep it split

1143
02:30:30,900 --> 02:30:31,140
there

1144
02:30:34,340 --> 02:30:41,140
here's our final our final emi redesign I think it's hot good stitches are good okay

1145
02:30:42,100 --> 02:30:52,340
I'll do another pull I'll do another pull for the stitches start a pull stitches on tongue or no

1146
02:30:52,740 --> 02:31:01,540
no yes okay hold on stitches on tongue question mark yes no okay there

1147
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:13,620
cut my life into pieces this is my last resort I'll bring it back just to show you oops no

1148
02:31:17,300 --> 02:31:19,380
this is what the stitches would look like kind of

1149
02:31:23,060 --> 02:31:32,100
okay it seems like the majority want no stitches stitches are too much okay what happened to my

1150
02:31:32,740 --> 02:31:35,860
oh there we go

1151
02:31:46,340 --> 02:31:52,500
okay 62% want no stitches so I'll end it there and we won't have stitches on the tongue

1152
02:31:54,740 --> 02:31:58,660
I'm converting to stitches you can't change in you can't change your mind now

1153
02:31:59,620 --> 02:32:05,380
I'm imagining what kissing stitches would feel like probably not good but I'm not gonna lie I find

1154
02:32:05,380 --> 02:32:12,900
it hot so I won't do it though if you don't want it I won't do it there maybe make the

1155
02:32:14,820 --> 02:32:16,980
maybe make it a little more obvious that this is a

1156
02:32:20,260 --> 02:32:21,940
make it a little more obvious that this is um

1157
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:23,000
um

1158
02:32:27,380 --> 02:32:28,260

yippie we did it

1161

they have cosmetic stitches that you can put inside you and do designs inside of me what

1162
02:32:52,260 --> 02:32:57,940
