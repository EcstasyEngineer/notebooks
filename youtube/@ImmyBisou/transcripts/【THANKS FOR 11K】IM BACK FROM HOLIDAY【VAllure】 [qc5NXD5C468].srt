60
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,200
Because I didn't think you'd actually be able to reach it. I was like, let me give them a goal of 10 k

61
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,320
So that way um, are you acting so gay? You know, I can get as high as possible. I'm anonymous to 20 dollars

66
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,800
Yeah, I gave you guys a goal of 10 k because I was like they're not going to be able to reach that

67
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,880
But let me just get as close as I can before I come back and you surpassed it

68
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,960
I should have been like 12 k 12 k. I should have said 12 k should have been 15 k

69
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,600
I really didn't think we'd even reach 10 k, but here we are. That's so crazy

70
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,760
I don't know if I'll do it like an actual stream to celebrate. I feel like

71
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,480
Maybe this makes me an asshole, but I feel like I need to have a higher uh

72
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,120
I used to be a higher threshold to have like a stream to celebrate maybe 20 30 tip 20

73
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,880
Takes a huge sniff to breath in that tummy scent to make sure it's real. It's real. It's real

82
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,200
I feel like 10k is too low, you know, we reached it too quickly. Are you okay?

83

But we'll do some sort of big celebration. Maybe I'll bake a cake or something. Anonymous tip $50. Oh, thank you. I missed you, Dill

86
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,680
Like I was probably gonna make it eventually but just not like for a specific goal

87
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,000
And you know make it on my own time whenever I felt like it but here we are

88
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,400
Will you stir ramen for your 20k celebration stream? Um, not on youtube

89
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,640
Not on youtube

90
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,600
Right, right, right. Let me let me talk about what's what's what happened. Okay. I kind of want to change

91
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
the background music first

92
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Because

93
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,200
I feel like we need to spice things up. I can't constantly have like, you know, my bgm

94
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,280
I'm gonna hope that animal crossing music with uh

With rain is gonna be okay

Ginger detected lots of things happened and lots of things didn't happen so

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,640
I'm like really afraid of flying right

126

I'm so afraid of flying that I did tell my mom I can't do it again next year

127
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,200
The other years it's like it's like a recent thing. Um

128
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,960

I think I did write on a bowing

143
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
I think I did

144
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,960
I remember reading the safety instructions

145
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,160

152
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,200
Ginger ale is supposed to make your tummy ache feel better, but I'm gonna make it worse

153
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,400
This is my handheld fan. This is not a vibrator

154
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,600
I got a handheld fan for my family. It's actually really nice. I like it

155
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
I'm really hot. Okay, sorry

156
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,960

158
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,240
Um, and she can't make me because I'm an adult

159
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,520
She'll have to fucking drag me onto that plane herself if she wants me to come

160
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,960
So I'm not going on this vacation next year. I will be here with you

161
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:41,280
I will stay with you. I can't go again. I I seriously can't do it again. I like I can't so um

162
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,800
Boeing is just the sound they make when they bounce off the ground

163
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,280
It wasn't really really like

164
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,840
This stalker has got to be fewing that you you won't be going again next year

165
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,240
I highly doubt you know where I went even if you think you know, you don't know

166
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Even if you think you know, you don't fucking know

167
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:11,200
You have to be a really really like you have to be in a really really tiny percentage of people to recognize where I went. Okay

168
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,240
Like

169
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,600
I will be very surprised if any of my viewers

170
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,000
Like know where I went. So yeah, um

171
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Um

172
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,480
What was I saying right the flights were all super super like

173
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,520
Bumpy and that like America. I did not go to America

174
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
I have to burp again

175
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,320
Sorry, it's because I'm drinking monster. Um

176
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
I

177
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,960
Forget what else that's what I'm saying, dude. I'm so like

178
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,160
Okay, I'm turning off this music. I can't handle it. I'm so like scatter range, right?

179
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
What was I saying

180
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:14,240
Are you gay the flights the flights the flights right the flight has a costio tipped four dollars and 20 cents

181
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,200
So we have house alone next year. Yes

182
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,960
Well, my mom doesn't live with me. So we have house alone all the time, but yeah

183
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
You definitely went to mars

184
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,160
No, I didn't I I debated showing you more pictures, but I was I don't know

185
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,680
It's like I don't mind if people try to guess where I went. Um, because you know, I'm not there anymore

186
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,960
But like I think other people it kind of um makes them uncomfortable because like

187
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,360
You don't have to worry about people trying to like, you know, guess where I am

188
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,480
I'm not worried about that. I've had such a

189
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,600
I've had way

190
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:02,480
scarier more scary things happen to me on the internet than someone simply being like, oh my god, she's in this

191
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,800
province or she's in in this state or she's in

192
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:14,240
In this uh, what's it called in this country, you know, I've had way more scary things happen

193
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,240
So it's like whatever if you want to fucking guess where I am go ahead. I don't care

194
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,320
But anyways, um, like it doesn't affect me. I'm not worried about it, but I went to Uranus. I did

195
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,120
I went in and out of Uranus really fucking fast over and over again. Uh, uh, uh, okay

196
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
It is a wild history

197
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,680
But I keep turning on the fan

198
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,400
It's not a vibrator. Okay. Um, right. So the flights were really really

199
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:52,640
Bumpy like all of them. You deserve a real privacy. I know I do but it like I don't really uh

200
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,520
Like I know I'm safe, you know, so I'm good

201
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Um

202
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,000
Anonymous tipped four dollars and 20 cents if we have the house alone

203
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,400

Why are you acting so gay?

208
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:43,120
Anonymous tipped six dollars and 90 cents. Don't worry. We are already outside of your window knock knock knock knock

Okay, anyways, um

211
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:55,600
The plane rides being bumpy is what scares me the most like

212
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,760
Every single time that the plane bumps or you know that feeling when you're on a plane

213
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
And you suddenly feel like you're falling a little bit

214
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,560
Or a lot

215
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,560
Depending on what fucking plane you're on

216
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:15,600
Like I feel like smaller planes have more bumpiness to them, but on the way back. Oh my god on the way on the literally

217
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,120
Like I there's this fucking show that I watched hold on. I don't remember what it was called

218
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,520
But it was a show like completely based off of like, um

219
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
plane crashes

220
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,760
Let me find it. It was from like wonder channel. There are spectators. They won't be bothered

221
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Wonder is that it

222
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:45,040
Wonder channel plane crashes. It was really old. Why are you acting so gay a really old show one tip 10 dollars

223
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
Please god more fishnet

224
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,960
I'll get you more fishnet. Yeah wonder channel

225
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,240
Mayday, that's what the show is called mayday. It's on youtube

226
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,600
And um, it's literally just a show about plane crashes

227
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,680
And I've watched a bunch of episodes from there and it scares the shit out of me every single time

228
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,360
It does not make my phobia better at all

229
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
Oh

230
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,760
The deadliest plane crash in aviation history that only left like I've watched all of these

231
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
Here I'll send the link in the

232
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,280
There you can go get scared with me

233
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,920
Oh, no, did not work. Oh, there it is right. So, um

234
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,280
Every single time the plane like bumped a little bit. I was like, it's fucking over. It's going down. We're going down

235
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:43,040
The first the first ride I cried a little bit more, but then the second ride I didn't like the way home. I didn't cry as much

236
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
I still cried a little bit

237
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,440
I still cried a little bit. I was really scared didn't stop watching them. I haven't watched them for a long time

238
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,280
I just like watched a bunch at once and it made it my fear worse because like

239
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
Like

240
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:10,080
Like when you're on a plane and something's going wrong the pirate the pirates the pilots aren't going to get on the

241
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:17,200
On the radio on the microphone and be like, all right, everyone on the plane. We are experiencing a severe

242
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
engine issues right now

243
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,120
Full body. I don't have a full body fishnet people thought I was wearing full body, but it was just um

244
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,040
It was just a shirt and uh like fishnet tights. It was separate

245
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,880
But yeah, they're not gonna go on the you know on the announcer and be like we are experiencing engine issues right now

246
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,280
Um, yeah, like they don't want people to freak out on the plane, you know

247
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,800
So they feel like they wouldn't tell you that something's going wrong

248
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,800
And that's what was really worrying me because it's like what if all this muffiness is because you know

249
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Something is going wrong on the plane

250
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,720
And I won't know until we start falling out of the sky

251
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,080
From I don't fucking know 40 000 feet in the air, you know, so that's like

252
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,240
That's what really worries me and that's why I hate flying

253
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,800
But I made it alive somehow

254
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,480
I was really scared the second the like the way home because it was so bumpy like we were there was like

255
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,120
A couple hours left of our flight and I was like, please just let me make it

256
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,360
Please just let me make it hold there's only there's only a little bit left, please

257
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,720
Attention everybody we are about to die right they're not gonna get on the announcer until everyone that we're gonna die

258
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,960
They're just gonna leave you wondering what's happening until you're dead

259
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,160
So that's what scares me

260
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
And not to mention it's like

261
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
it's like really um

262
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,320
It's really suffocating and like claustrophobic because my mom's a cheapskate and she bought my plane ticket for me

263
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,560
So

264
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,920
Like red less she bought her plane tickets. So she obviously is not gonna get anything

265
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,040
Anything fancy we went in economy

266
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
If it was up to me, I would have bought like

267
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,440
Something more, you know with more space, but she doesn't care

268
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,960
So yeah, I even tried on the way home. I was like mom just let me like let me pay for like see upgrades is fine

269
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,720
I'll do it. I don't care and she's like nope. You're not paying for it. We're not doing it. You're not doing it

270
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
So that fucking sucks

271
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,600
Any percent of every flight is on autopilot only during takeoff and landing is the pilot actually taking control

272
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,160
Well, the pilot was shit at taking off. They took off so shittily

273
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,880
On the way home. I remember feeling like like what's wrong? I wanted to curse at the pilot on the way home. Oh my god

274
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,840
The death berry tip 20 dollars. I wish we could be there with you to help you through it

275
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
I know I know

276
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,760
I know

277
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
I wish you were there with me too

278
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Oh

279
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,640
Why didn't you upgrade her seat right if you're gonna stock my plane upgrade my seat for me?

280
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,680
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I don't care

281
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,520
My dad is also lg po. I feel yet. Yeah

282
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:27,760
Oh, my mom stressed me out too. My mom is like both my mom and my uncle are very

283
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:35,280
They're in denial about it. So they won't admit it, but they're very like stressed people

284
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,920
Like they have a very stressful aura around them. Like they're constantly stressing about every little thing

285
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,240
And because of that like just being around them like stresses you out too

286
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,120
And that's how my mom is and that's also how my uncle is so

287
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,840
um

288
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,000
The pilot saw your name on the passenger list and went oh, let's make this a bumpy ride just for any

289
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Probably

290
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,880
Anonymous tipped four dollars and twenty cents. You want to join the mile high club at me?

291
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,440
Thank you anonymous

292
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
Are you asking me if I want to smoke weed with you?

293
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,760
You're very brave for getting on the plane. Thank you

294
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,920
You are breathing pretty heavily because I'm talking so fast. I know so it's hot in this room. Um

295
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,760
I don't smoke weed. I would never smoke weed. I would okay. That's not true

296
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,680
I would never smoke weed with my rats in the apartment, but I might take edibles

297
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,320
Should we do a streamer 20k stream where I get high?

298
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,440
Oh wait the mile high club is when you plop on the plane. Wait

299
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,560
Wait, really? Wait, I thought that's just where you get high

300
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,640
Wait, I didn't know that's what the mile. Hello. Wait. I thought I thought you when I thought mile high club was like just smoking weed and getting high

301
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Oh my god

302
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
Ha ha ha

303
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,640
You're only just now. Yeah

304
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,720
Plopping on the plane sounds so scary and dangerous

305
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,720
Sex on a plane is the mile high club. That's so scary. I would cry

306
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,880
I would cry the whole time. I'd be too scared

307
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Excuse me

308
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
Are you gay?

309
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840
You know

310
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,400
I know can we have the stealthy bathroom story stealthy bathroom story? Oh

311
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,240
You mean like the picture of my my fingers from twitter

312
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Mostly on the toilet

313
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,960
I know I'm not saying I'll smoke weed on the plane. I'm saying for 20k. We might do some fun stuff

314
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,920
I don't know

315
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,960
I usually I don't really do like drugs or anything

316
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,040
Surprisingly

317
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Surprisingly, I'm not on any drugs

318
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,240
I mean, I told you I'm not on any drugs because I don't take you know

319
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,920
Gay?

320
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,920
Why are you acting so gay?

321
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:19,200
Anonymous tip six dollars and 90 cents. I've been holding for two weeks. So these heavy breaths are getting to me. Welcome back

322
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,400
Every little thing is getting to you. Huh? Do you want more?

323
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
I

324
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
I'm sorry. I'm sorry

325
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,920
Happy 11k. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I I feel like I'm not really that unhinged. I'm pretty chill

326
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
I'm pretty chill

327
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
I

328
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
On life

329
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,520
Not really

330
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,000
Um, oh, yeah, we have new we have new emotes now, right? Do you like them? I like them. I chose them myself

331
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,240
I think they're really cute. I like them a lot

332
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Okay, right

333
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,240
I need to tell you more stories. I have so many things to talk about. Okay

334
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,800
The edibles by yourself before you tried on stream, I tried them. I've tried edibles before

335
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,920
I feel like you know that meme where it's like these edibles ain't shit and then like, I don't know an hour later

336
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,920
You're like loopy. It's like

337
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,840
The opposite for me. I say that these edibles ain't shit and then

338
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,800
The edibles ain't shit. So I don't know

339
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,080
The worst I've ever felt from an edible was my mom came over to visit me

340
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,600
And I ate up before she came and then I felt like slightly dizzy at the grocery store

341
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,520
And that's all on him is tipped one dollar. So what we get drunk. So what we smoke weed

342
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,640
We just having fun and we don't care who sees so what we go out

343
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,120
That's how it's supposed to be

344
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
living young and wild and free

345
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
Nice song lyrics

346
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,640
Hi on vitamin b for big bro

347
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,520
I'm high on the fact that I can see you again and I can talk to you again

348
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,320
Why did the background music changed? I turned off the um

349
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:26,160
Animal crossing music. All right. Sorry. Sorry hand picture story. It's not really a story. There's not much to say. I just like

350
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Since I stayed up, you know

351
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,600
All night I kind of just like sneaked away

352
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,520
I just sneaked away while people were like sleeping and I did it

353
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,400
But like I said, I was

354
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,920
Like it was really quiet, you know, everyone was super quiet and I I you know, I sneaked away and

355
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
I didn't I didn't relieve myself

356
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
I just just a little

357
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
I just a little bit

358
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,920
The diary entries getting more desperate was so good

359
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,480
I'm glad you enjoyed them all the prongs

360
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,040
Just being away from you got to me to be honest

361
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,480
It sucked

362
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,040
Yeah, I was really scared someone would hear me because it was like

363
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,760
It was so quiet everywhere and like my my aunt's bedroom was so close to the bathroom

364
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
Really sexy at me

365
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,560
You're supposed to be in in the sex corporal. Why are you being why are you not being sex constantly? Um

366
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,400
Not finishing is more of an achievement when you actually could have but chose not to I don't think so

367
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,840
No, I purposefully not finish a lot

368
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,520
You know, sometimes I don't want the fun to end so soon

369
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,320
But yeah, um, it was really loud. It was like

370
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,920
So I just did a little bit and then I left I took a picture and then I left

371
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,800
It was so loud. It was so loud. I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it. Not with people around. Sorry

372
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,000
They don't know you're streamed. No, they don't some of us were suffering there

373
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
With you and they're still suffering

374
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,680
right

375
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,760
My rats are fine. Um

376
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,680
Someone said yeah, fuck. I'm so bad at streaming. How are your rat babies? By the way, my rats are fine

377
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,480
It's really it's really cute because I left because I got two babies

378
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,800
And when I left they were still pretty small

379
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,120
But like literally two weeks later and they've grown so much in so little time. They're like almost adult size now

380
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,680
Oh time passes by so quickly for rats

381
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,640
You're in the comfortable enough with your significant other phase uh that I can fart and burp around you

382
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,960
You mentioned that liking the exposure, but I think you have started to enjoy it. No, I told you I didn't I didn't enjoy it

383
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,120
I told you I didn't enjoy it. I told you I didn't like it. I told you I was scared

384
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,720
I can't do it. I can't do it. I'm scared and I don't like it. I'm scared

385
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,080
Um

386
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
Let me drink more

387
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,160
Bro my freaking

388
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,480
My models eyes blink stupidly a lot. I think it's because I'm wearing glasses

389
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,760
So it can't always see when I'm blinking and when I'm not blinking

390
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Maybe it's also because of the ring light

391
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,920
I don't know

392
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,440
Okay, okay

393
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,160
Don't remind me that rats die past. I have to remind you it's the truth of life

394
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,360
I've had

395
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,720
one two

396
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,040
Three I've had three rats die on me so far

397
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,560
In all of my lifetime of owning rats. I've had three die

398
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,160
And uh, you know, I have four now so

399
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,040
I gotta deal with

400
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,520
I think I had three die. Yeah, I gotta deal with four more deaths. Eventually

401
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
What flavor monster uh, just

402
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Just uh ultra strawberry dreams

403
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,840
Polisa come through I'm really scared of lasik. I don't think uh, I don't think I'm gonna do that

404
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,120
I'm really really worried that I'm gonna go blind. So yeah, no

405
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,840
Okay

406
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
Okay, okay, well I have to burp again

407
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,280
Uh, right

408
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,880
Okay, other stuff I did what did I do? Um, um, um

409
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,200
Here I have something I have stories for you

410
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,880
So one thing I wanted to talk about that was kind of funny was um

411
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:19,280
I just muted myself was my mom and my aunt kept trying to like awkwardly set me up with guys

412
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,760
It was really weird and awkward like the first time was um

413
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:33,840
You shouldn't drink energy drinks. It's being linked to a huge rise in young adults pieces of core rectal cancer

414
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,840
I'm here for a good time not for a long time

415
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,160
Oh such a shitty, okay

416
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:52,320
Just remember emmy they might not be around for all of your life, but to the chaos potatoes you are their whole life

417
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,960
I know I know

418
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,440
That's what matters

419
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,960
Right, so they kept trying to awkwardly set me up with guys and it was really awkward. The first time was um

420
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,840
Do they really not know we're together? No, we have to hide it from them

421
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,520
The first time was um

422
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,560
I went to like this restaurant that had like uh entertainment, you know, like live entertainment

423
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,560
It was like an outdoor restaurant. They had live entertainment there

424
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,680
And I went with my cousin um my

425
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,360
Aunt her boyfriend my mom

426
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,760
And my uncle's wife. So I guess that's also my aunt. I think I think so. I think that's how it works. I don't know

427
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
I think so um

428
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,440
and my um

429
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,120
My my aunt's childhood best friend came too, right and her

430
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,920
best friend has like a son

431
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,560
And he's not even my age. He's like

432
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,880
20

433
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,560
I think she's like 27. I uh, I think he's like 27

434
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,520
Yeah, he's not my age, but anyways, they were like, oh

435
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,880
Gay, why are you acting so gay?

436
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,120
Anonymous tipped one dollar does big bro have to fight someone

437
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:17,680
Who is going to take my little sister from me? Do I need to leave a little love bite on your neck to mark you as my property?

438
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,440
No, no, no, no, I'm gonna take you for no. It's gonna take me from you. Don't worry

439
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,320
but they were like

440
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,840
Oh, you're your aunt's best friend, you know, she's like really rich, right and she has a son

441
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,480
You know

442
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,080
She has a son and um, they're inviting us over for barbecue after the restaurant

443
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,800
Um, and at first because like other people in my family were going to

444
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,440
So at first I was like, oh, you know, maybe because she also spoke french

445
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,440
So that was cool. I could speak french with her. I spoke french with her a bit. Um

446
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,280
She was really nice and I was like, well, you know, because my cousins were going to that barbecue, too

447
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,560
So I was like, oh, um, you know, maybe

448
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,680
Sure, maybe I'll go after um

449
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,720
And she asked me like, oh, are you coming?

450
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,760
She was she really wanted me to come out and I was like, um, I'm not sure maybe

451
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,760
And we ended up spending a long time at that restaurant. I had like fucking three. What's it called?

452
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
What's that? What's that type of?

453
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:38,080
That was a gross thank you for the two dollars gold mario that was a growth spurt. I had three cocktails

454
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:43,280
Okay, I felt fucking nothing. It was a shitty ass restaurant. The alcohol was trash

455
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,720
At three cocktails while I was waiting for them to like waiting for all the adults to finish talking

456
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,320
I was so fucking bored. The music was

457
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,840
The music was just okay, I guess I didn't know the songs but the other people did so I couldn't sing along

458
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,160
It was like, you know, um, it wasn't a popular band. It was like a local

459
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,040
local band playing

460
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,040
So, um

461
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,280
Just say you you viewing some prospects to mary already us

462
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,160
But um

463
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,600
Afterwards, you know, I was like, mom, it was like fucking two hours later or maybe more than that

464
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:32,640
And I was like, mom, can we fucking go like I'm so bored even my cousin and her mom had left already

465
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,160
So I was like, mom like let's go

466
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,440
And she was like, oh, but we have to go to the barbecue afterwards. Don't you want to go to the barbecue? You know, her son is there

467
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,800
And I was like, I don't care anymore

468
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,840
And even even um, you know, the the lady my aunt's best friend was like, oh

469
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,560
ask a tv

470
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,080
You know, there's a lot of young people there. Don't you want to hang out with them? And I was like, no

471
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:08,560
No, I don't want to hang out with them. So I had to leave by myself with my mom and walk home

472
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Because my aunt refused to leave

473
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,080
So I just walked home after that with my mom

474
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:21,200
Because my aunt was the one that drove us there. So she had the car and she didn't want to go and then afterwards

475
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
After that happened a couple days later

476
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,800
Um, my aunt was doing my nails for me. She did a really good job. She painted them like a nice black color

477
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,760
I like them a lot. They're cute, but my aunt was doing my nails for me and um

478
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,600
My mom was sitting next to me and she was like

479
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:48,480
She was like talking I think I had asked her about like my aunt's best friend's like life a little bit because like

480
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,800
um, you know

481
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,600
A lot of the people in that town are not really rich. So I was like, oh, you know, how'd you get rich?

482
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,160
Why are you acting so gay? Thank you for the two dollars. I'm on a mistipped one dollar

483
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,520
Would we have a drinking game stream at some point? Oh, that would be fun. What's your favorite song?

484
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,400
I want to have it in my playlist to play whenever you are on top online and I miss you

485
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,760
Um, I go through favorite songs really fast

486
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,160
But I can tell you like some of my favorites here. I can type it in chat

487
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,080
You haven't shown us your nails. I'll show them to you. They're not amazing

488
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,960
They're not amazing because you know, it's my aunt. She's not like a professional or anything

489
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,760
But um, she was doing them. So

490
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,560
Oops, all right

491
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
I didn't finish typing. Hold on

492
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,480
I I how do I am I stupid?

493
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,640
Fuck why am I stupid? Okay. Well, there's one of my favorite songs

494
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
Um

495
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,640
I'm just looking through my Spotify playlist

496
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,400
Uh, let's go with the last one. Okay

497
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:21,920
There's a bunch of songs that if you want to check out you can I don't know it. There's no pressure anything. I feel like

498
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,640
Why didn't the last one send? Oh, there we go. I feel like oh, I fucking wrote that wrong. It's just love sick not love six

499
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,040
Sorry, I'm typing kind of quick there

500
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,520
You don't have to I feel like I don't know I feel like

501
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,640
Like I don't have a

502
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,240
You know

503
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,200
You know, I don't have the most interesting

504
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,640
music preference. I kind of just listen to whatever

505
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,200
so

506
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,240
You know, it's not like that interesting for people, but it's okay. Um

507
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,920
Right the second time I my aunt was doing my nails and I was talking to to my mom about like my aunt's best friend

508
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,360
And she was just telling me like her story about like, I know she married a

509
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,080
She she married a lawyer

510
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:19,360
She married a lawyer and then that lawyer divorced her and so she had she got a bunch of money from the divorce and you know

511
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,680
I forgot what she said her son did. I don't know but she was like, you know, her son's also rich

512
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
Do you want to see him?

513
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:36,400
And I was like, um, I don't know not really but then they fucking stalked her on Facebook and they found pictures of her son

514
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,520
And they kept saying like, oh, he's cute. He's cute, right?

515
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,480
And then my aunt showed me a picture

516
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,760
And I was like

517
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,040
You could do what I see does and post the songs on twitter tree

518
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,520
I know but I like I don't want to because I feel like it's not interesting, you know

519
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,480
like

520
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,840
I don't know and I don't think people would be interested so I don't do it

521
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,720
But this feels like when your girlfriend tells you a story about her ex-partners. I think it's funny

522
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,920
It's not my ex. I never even met this dude, but um

523
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,560
She showed me a picture

524
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:24,960
Obviously he's not watching so I can say that but I so I can say this but I laughed at his picture and I was like, what the fuck is this?

525
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,480
What the fuck is this?

526
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,320
And then I showed my mom and my mom was like, oh, he's so cute

527
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,480
He's so cute and handsome and I was like, um, I don't really like his beard and my mom was like, huh?

528
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,800
He has a beard what?

529
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,520
And I I was like, well, what do you mean what and she's like, oh, sorry. I'm not wearing my glasses right now

530
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,520
I can't really see

531
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:52,160
And I was like, mom you're calling him cute and handsome, but you can't even see what he fucking looks like

532
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,640
He can't even see what he looks like what do you mean? He's cute

533
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,480
like

534
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:09,440
Come on mom you can't pressure me like this and not even know what this dude looks like

535
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,680
And then the third time was just some random kid came over

536
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,400
To my grandparents house and my mom was like

537
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,640
You want to see him?

538
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,200
We can walk by real quick. We can just walk by

539
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,240
So you can take a look at him

540
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,840
She's never done this before either. I don't know why she

541
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,200
She was so adamant

542
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,320
She has dollar sign contacts on trill trill. That's probably it. Yeah

543
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,360
That's definitely it

544
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,080
This is making them sound extra desperate. They were they were weird about it

545
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,600
The blur is absolutely adorable

546
00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:00,160
Um, yes, this blurred format on my phone is so cute. You should you should hook up with him, Amy

00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,240
I don't care. I have my big brother. I don't care about anyone else

555
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,080
She was gonna sell me off

Except I don't think I don't think he was even gonna take me because he's like

557
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,440
She told me like oh, you know, he's uh

558
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:54,880
Since he's rich, she's kind of like a playboy. That's what she told me and I was like well

559
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,640
Why the fuck would would would you try to get me like to be?

So I'm guessing that you like your big brothers to have a bit of a baby face if you don't like beards guys who are a bit nerdy and awkward

569
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,800
I

570
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,560
Okay

571
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,560
I'm gonna be honest before

572
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,640
Before I started here. I didn't really like beards

573
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,600
But now that I think about it more

574
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,680
Maybe I don't care that much

575
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,560
If it's you, maybe I don't care as much anymore

576
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,480
But I I I also do like a baby face too

581
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,480
Really attractive at all. I don't know what she thought maybe she just thought the money would like tempt me or something

582
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,440
Um

583
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:46,240
No, you don't have to start shaving. I literally just said if it's you I don't really care

584
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,240
I don't really care

585
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,640

Can't even grow a beard. That's okay

591
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,880
The only thing I don't like

592
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,760
Sorry

593
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,760
I'll take a beard. I don't care anymore

594
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,360
If it's you, I don't care anymore. But the only thing I don't like

595
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,880
Is if it's like you struggle to grow a beard like it's really really sparse

596
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,920
But you like grow it out anyways

597
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,440
And it's like the the really sparse kind of beard. That's where I'm like, come on

598
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:43,280
Just just I I'm sorry, but just shave it off. It's okay. I know you might be in denial, but it's okay

599
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,040
It's okay. You don't have to have one

600
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,320
My my cousin is like that he's in denial

601
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:03,840
Yeah, like wispy peach fuzz, but he's like in denial and he's like no no no I have a beard. I have a beard. It's just growing in

602
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,840
Like you just just just if you have one, you know, let it grow. It's fine

603
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:15,280
And if you don't have one, that's also fine. But but but don't be in denial about what you have

604
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,960
No, you don't have to shave after this. It's okay. It's okay

605
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:32,080
So we can't cope but you can about being ginger. Yes. Yes. Why are you so gay?

630
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,640
I know some of you have your sick twisted fantasies where I go do something

631
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,800
Well, I'm gone from stream for a little bit and and then post it on twitter

632
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,120
I know I'm not doing that. I feel like I'm too

633
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:34,000
I'm too much of a perfectionist to do that. You guys don't know this and I'm sorry if it ruins some of your uh

634
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,840
You know some of your your uh

635
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,400
Your illusion but like I actually

636
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,040
Why are you acting for the one dollar?

637
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,200
Anonymous tipped one dollar

638
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:53,600
This reminds me so much of how you were begging big bro to let you go to the bathroom and promised an audio for us

639
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,720
That was the cutest thing I've ever seen the way you were so desperate to make big brother happy

640
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,120
Thank you

641
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:10,160
Oh, did you want me to record me peeing? No, that's not happening again. That's not happening again, but um your mission

642
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,520
I do actually like I record

643
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,600
I record more some most of my twitter audios with a 3dl

644
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,360
Um, and I have to set up stuff

645
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:27,360
And then afterwards I do I like I do actually treat the audio like I I uh noise

646
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:32,160
No, I suppress or what it was a cool like I I I remove the background sound

647
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,720
I do fucking

648
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:42,320
I do some some compression. I do some equalizer. I don't like I I do edit the audio to make it sound cleaner

649
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:49,200
Like I really don't want to just grab my phone and like record myself with my phone and then post it right after like

650
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,840
I'm too much of a perfectionist to do that

651
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:58,960
Like I cut out any like, you know pauses and stuff or if I get interrupted like I cut that out like

652
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:05,280
I put too much effort like I want it to be good, you know noise gate. No, no, I don't

653
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,200
I don't know

654
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,600
noise gate is just for my stream microphone. I think

655
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:18,400
But like I I I do stuff, you know, do you do multiple takes sometimes? I do and that's when it gets really annoying because I will like

656
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,320
You know, I'll get all

657
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,720
I'll get it everywhere

658
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,960
And then I have to touch

659
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,240
You know my microphone and my keyboard and my mouse afterwards to restart. It's annoying

660
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,000
Um, but yeah, I I really

661
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:38,080
I really

662
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,800
I want raw uncut audio

663
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:48,320
Well, most it is mostly uncut. Most of them have been uncut. It's just like treated treated edited

664
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,400
It's just edited to like sound

665
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,760
Like good quality or better quality, you know

666
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,360
Have you peeing? No

667
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:05,360
I just I am too much of a perfectionist to like have it not be perfect. It's still raw

668
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,040
You know, it's not I haven't faked it or anything

669
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,840
It's just you know

670
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,200
Gooning and high definition high quality

671
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,240
Put that shit on the surround sound audio system in your living room

672
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
You know what I mean

673
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:28,640
So yeah, uh, that's why that's why I don't really want to just like, you know

674
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,960
Grab my phone dork it off stream and then come back here with you

675
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:39,280
So I do take them very seriously. I got professionals have standards. Okay. Um, like even

676
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,840
Like um, when I before viewer I would um, leave in a lot of like

677
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,560
mistakes in my audio

678
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:55,200
Because I knew that I could just cut out whatever I wanted when I was editing my own audio, right?

679
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,120
Like I could just you know, I could leave as many mistakes as I want

680
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,480
I I I had a lot of cut out cut off breaths and I I could edit it myself and fix it myself

681
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,640
But now after joining I'm like

682
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,880
The editors don't know what I want. You know, they don't know how I like it

683
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:18,240
So I've literally changed the way I record here. So that way it's like easier on the editors and they can like

684
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,320
Edit it edit it better the way I want because I've already

685
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,040
Cut it the way I want

686
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:32,400
I've only started doing that recently. So I'm hoping more recent audios will have a little better quality

687
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,080
So, yeah, um

688
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,040
I take I take gooning very seriously. Okay

689
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,200
Um, but yeah

690
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,280
What was I saying? Oh, yeah, my aunt. Okay, so

691
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,560
I feel like it's very confusing when I say cousin I have three cousins

692
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,800
um

693
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,040
I have two girl cousins and one guy

694
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,960
um

695
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,200
We can call the girl cousin

696
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,480
Maria um, and then the the second girl cousin

697
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,600
Uh

698
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:19,280
Natalia, I'm just thinking of the names Maria Natalia and then the guy cousin can be

699
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,560
Anthony

700
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,760
There there's my three cousins, right?

701
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:34,640
So I went to a different city to with my aunt

702
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,400
My cousin Maria and my mom and we were gonna go visit my

703
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,200
other cousin Natalia

704
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,400
In that city and also, um, my great aunt also lived in that city, right?

705
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:55,120
Just do one two three and you're going to forget the names. No, I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it

706
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,640
Okay, so yeah, I went to a different city to go visit them, right?

707
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,960
And um while we were driving there Maria's

708
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:09,360
Dad called us so my uncle and he was like, hey, I know you're going to go visit this aunt

709
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,040
Absolutely under no circumstances. Do not let Maria

710
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,720
Like come with you to visit that aunt. It's like don't let

711
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,240
Don't don't bro is trying really hard not to screw

712
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,440
I can't say real names here. Okay. I'm not stupid

713
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,080
And don't say winces. I don't do anything with my cousins. What do you mean?

714
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,720
but anyways, um

715
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,840
Yeah, he called us and he was like do not let Maria

716
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,560
Talk to your aunt under no circumstances and I was like after they ended the call

717
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:42,080
I was like, why not? Like what's wrong with what's going on here?

718
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,120
and Maria was like

719
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,520
Yeah, so she actually tried to trick us

720
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,160
into like

721
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,960
So basically this aunt is all alone, right? This great aunt is all alone. She's an old lady

722
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,120
Her husband died. She never had any kids

723
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:03,440
And since she's old she has like health issues and stuff, right? Like she's struggling and

724
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:11,120
What she tried to do apparently was she tried to trick Maria into coming to that city

725
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,800
And and living with her

726
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,280
By being like, oh

727
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:23,200
You can have my apartment after I die like you can come to the city and you can go to school here because you know

728
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,240
There's a big nice school here and you can live with me for free

729
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,800
You just have to take care of me and after I die you can have my apartment, right?

730
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,160
That was the deal that she tried to

731
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:39,840
Yeah, it's the family drama. That was the deal that she tried to strike with with my cousin Maria, right?

732
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:44,960
She's all my cousins are around my age except for anthony. He's a little older. He's like 30 or something

733
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,240
I don't know, but um, the rest of my cousins are my age, right?

734
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,520
so

735
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,520
You know, they were like, okay

736
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:00,800
Maybe you know show us some proof that you will actually give Maria your apartment

737
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:08,320
And she like faked documents. She like faked something as proof to like

738
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,480
You know prove that she's actually gonna give Maria her apartment, right?

739
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,440
And they found out it was fake and they were like fuck this shit

740
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:20,800
You're just trying to get you know, you're just trying to get this poor girl to take care of you until you fucking die

741
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,080
And you're not gonna give her anything

742
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,680
right

743
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,240
Yeah, she wasn't gonna give her anything

744
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:34,400
So they were like under no circumstances. Do not let Maria come to that place because we're mad at her

745
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,040
You know, don't don't let them meet. We're mad at her. She doesn't

746
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,200
She doesn't deserve to see her her, you know her. What's it called?

747
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:46,640
Her niece she doesn't deserve to see her niece if she's gonna be an asshole like that, right?

748
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,840
So um

749
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:57,280
I was like damn that's fucking crazy. I hope she doesn't do that to me. I hope she doesn't I hope she doesn't do that to me

750
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,320
So, you know, we drop off

751
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,480
We drop off Maria

752
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:08,640
With you know, my other cousin because they're sisters, right Maria Natalia our sisters

753
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,280
So we drop her off

754
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,880
You know with my cousin that lives in that city and then me and my mom

755
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,600
went to go visit this gradient

756
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,640
Um, why does every family have someone like that? I don't know

757
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:28,400
Why scan someone after death? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe she had other plans

758
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:32,000
With that apartment. I don't know but um

759
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,600
It's not even a nice fucking apartment. Like it's

760
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:41,200
It's bigger than mine, but it's not it's not a nice apartment. Like it's not in a nice building

761
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,600
It it's not high quality. It's like a really really old run-down place

762
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,080
So like who would want it not me

763
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,160
But um, anyways, I get there and you know, she's

764
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,960
nice, I guess

765
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
She's nice like

766
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,880
She's really old so like she can't do much but she you know gave us some

767
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:12,000
Expired chocolate and she talked to us and she asked us, you know, how's blank doing?

768
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,240
How's this person in the family doing? How's this person in the family doing? Um

769
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,080
How is maria doing, you know maria it's such a shame that she rejected my offer

770
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:28,320
She literally said that she was so pissed about it. She ran to us about it. Um

771
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,800
Um

772
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:36,080
Does the apartment have a c no it doesn't like it's a really shitty run-down place

773
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,040
um

774
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,120
So like

775
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,920
After we caught up my gradient was like

776
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,960
So emi

777
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,960
you like

778
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,400
So emi

779
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,320
You like it here, don't you?

780
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:01,040
And I was like, oh, yeah, obviously. I'm not gonna be like I fucking hate it here, you know

781
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:07,040
I fucking hate it. I I fucking hate this place. I'm not gonna say that to my gradient. So I was like, yeah

782
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:13,120
Yeah, sure. I like it here. It's it's nice or whatever. I don't I don't care. Yeah, and she was like

783
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,160
Why don't you stay here?

784
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,480
Why is my phone getting a call?

785
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,720
I

786
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,960
Okay, why don't you stay here?

787
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,400
And I was like, oh, um

788
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,880
I

789
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,880
and then she's like

790
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,960
If you stay here, you can live with me

791
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,400
You can live with me and when I die, I'll give you my apartment

792
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:44,800
You know apartments are really expensive in this city

793
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,520
You can have mine and you can stay here with me

794
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,880
And then I was like

795
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:03,440
I'm okay. I'm okay. Thank you. It's okay. I don't need it and she's like you don't you don't want a free apartment. Are you sure?

796
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,440
You won't have to buy one. You can just have this one

797
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,560
And you can stay here with me

798
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,120
Uh

799
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:20,480
Obsessive big bro script idea. You cannot trick me with an apartment. I don't want it

800
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,880
Why the fuck are my notifications?

801
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:32,880
How do I turn notifications off on this phone? I never really use this phone other than streaming because it's an iphone

802
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,960
I don't fucking care

803
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,600
I thought I used iphone to like stream

804
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,920
um

805
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:43,440
To like stream, um, you know because they have better tracking

806
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,080
So, yeah, um

807
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:54,320
It's cute when little sis does it it's only cute when I try to kidnap you is all you're saying

808
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,960
Just tell her you're already staying staying with big bro

809
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,640
She would be appalled. I know iphone suck. I don't like them at all

810
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,240
but um

811
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,200
Like she's really old and like the sense that like

812
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:16,800
She was she like stood up to like fucking go to the next room to the bathroom

813
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:23,360
And when she came back just from that like little walk from the bathroom to to her living room. She was like

814
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:30,960
Like she was really out of breath and she had like a whole bag full of medicine on her table

815
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:36,400
Like you know, she's old and she has a lot of health issues and I felt bad for her but it's like

816
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:45,600
You you you know, you have um, you have other cousins you can go you can go ask

817
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,560
Sorry, I'm I'm cousins. You have other nieces and nephews that you can go ask

818
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,000
You know, you don't have to ask me like I don't even live here. You know, I'm not gonna

819
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:58,960

822
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,480
Every time we come to visit this family, she always calls and asks us to visit her

823
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:21,520
And every time we're like, uh, yeah, yeah, we'll come and then we don't come we don't come

824
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,120
Calm down with the sound effects. What's up? What am I I'm not playing sound effects

825
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:36,640
Yeah, sorry granny, I don't want to sacrifice my youth. Yep, I'm not doing it for a shitty apartment

826
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,280
But before that we went to a mall

827
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:46,000
It was a pretty big mall. It was cool, but I

828
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:54,640
I don't know how grossed out you are by periods. I hope you're not grossed out by periods because I talk a lot about my period

829
01:09:55,520 --> 01:10:00,320
But um, I was on my period when we went to the mall and like I said, I was

830
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:05,600
I had really bad cramps. I had so bad like my cramps are so bad that like

831
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,760
painkillers

832
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,760
Oh, thank you for the one dollar

833
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:14,800
Anonymous took one dollar come closer big bro wants to give you a kiss

836
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,040
Thank you. Okay, um

837
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:35,440
So I had taken painkillers before leaving and I still felt like shit and I was gonna vomit on the fucking

838
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:40,400
I was gonna vomit on in the car and my aunt had to drive slower for me

839
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,800
And then we stopped before before the mall we stopped at a

840
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,160
Monastery and that was kind of cool

841
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:52,480
It was really big they had nice bathrooms

842
01:10:53,440 --> 01:11:01,040
Nice bathrooms is a is a rarity over there. So I was surprised. Oh my god. That's so gross at the airport

843
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,600
When we first got there, I went to the bathroom and it was so shitty and gross and stinky and they didn't have toilet paper

844
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:12,080
They didn't have toilet paper and I didn't have toilet paper. So I had to leave the bathroom with my pissy panties

845
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
It was gross but um

846
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:24,240
The monastery we had a nice bathroom and also there was like a lady there and she my mom wanted to buy a bunch of like crosses

847
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:31,120
Like those hanging crosses for like the the car, you know the car the car crosses

848
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,640
I'm not really religious but my mom kind of is so she bought like a bunch of those

849
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,200
and they like prayed at the

850
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,640
Inside of the the church thing. It was really fancy and big. I kind of just

851
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:51,440
Period is blood blood tastes like nickels and coins and I'm the greedy little coin garden

852
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,800
Thank you, June

853
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,240
I'll give you some of my my coins

854
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,680
In me the peeler life really did choose you

855
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,880
I feel like I chose a peeler life to be honest. I was never really that much into pee

856
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,280
You can go to another stall. No, it was it was an airport bathroom

857
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,280
Like it was busy like

858
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,760
I'm not gonna just like, you know

859
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:26,240
No, it was it was busy and I wanted to leave like I wanted to go, you know, I didn't like it there. So, um

860
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,840
Oh, what was I saying, right monastery

861
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:38,480
I just kind of stood outside on the bench next to a stray dog

862
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:43,120
And waited for them to to be done because I was like

863
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,560
I don't really care about being here

864
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,760
Yeah, and then we left and I was more tired and nauseous and then we went to the mall

865
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,400
And then at the mall

866
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:01,360
I was more tired and nauseous and we stayed there for like four fucking hours because it was a really big mall

867
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:07,760
And oh everyone wanted to shop because we picked up Natalia and she came shopping with us

868
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,960
And um

869
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:17,040
I mostly just stood outside and sat on the benches outside

870
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:22,000
And really did nothing because the malls didn't the mall didn't have wi-fi

871
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:28,560
And it was only like individual stores that had wi-fi and it wasn't all of them. It was like, I don't know

872
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,840
What's the store? It was like the fucking

873
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,240
H&M store had their own h&m wi-fi

874
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,640
And then the fucking zara store had their own zara wi-fi

875
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:46,560
But not every single store had wi-fi. So it really depended on which store my mom and my cousins went to

876
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,000
That would determine whether or not I had wi-fi to

877
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,240
entertain myself for a couple of minutes, you know, so that fucking sucked

878
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,320
But I did get I did find a a lego flower

879
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,080
um

880
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:07,600
Set, you know those lego flowers to to make that's really fun. I've never done that before

881
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,560
So I liked that

882
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:19,440
I I didn't want to use the my data because like my mom would get charged extra because it's like not in canada, you know

883
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,520
So, yeah

884
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,280
Women be shopping

885
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:32,160
I shopped a little too, but it was really like

886
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:38,240
It was like the first store we went to I like looked around and I got like a sweater and a shirt

887
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,560
I might be able to show you that. I don't know

888
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,360
Well, it was really cute. I really like

889
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,000
Are you gay? It was a cute shirt. Why are you so gay?

890
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:54,080
Anonymous tipped one dollar speaking of dogs. Are you planning on wearing that shock collar again?

891
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,160
Be a good girl little ginger and I won't give you a little shock

892
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,280
Little ginger

893
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,200
I'm not gonna fucking wear the shock collar if you're gonna call me a little ginger

894
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,240
roaming gets really expensive too. It does that's why

895
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:15,760
Later on I did romanos like mom. I can't do this anymore. I'll pay you for the roaming charges. I don't care

896
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,720
You have a great sense of fashion. We love to see it. Maybe maybe maybe I'll show you what I got there

897
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:30,480
You don't just have tiktoks. You're not gonna watch save to your camera roll. Oh, no, what the fuck?

898
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,400
The lego botanicals. Yeah that

899
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:44,560
I remember woman's store. I was in a mall had one of those touch screen spotify jukeboxes on the walls

900
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,040
I rick rolled the store and left

901
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,200
Can we do it on stream? I might I might do it. Yeah, I might

902
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,160
Tough talk for a ginger and a shock collar distance

903
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:08,000
I'm not in a shock collar distance. Oh, one of the one of the jokers came one of the jokers came while I was gone

904
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,800
Oh, fuck I have something embarrassing to say

905
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:18,400
You're not gonna like it. Oh, you're gonna be so mad at me if I say this

906
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,600
Okay, I have a confession. Hold on

907
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:33,600
You're gonna be so mad at me. Oh dude, okay

908
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:42,000
So remember that remember how we had um a vote for what?

909
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Not scientifically possible

910
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,320
I'm about to make it scientifically possible. Remember how we had a vote

911
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:57,680
In the free chat over what I was going to put on the color tags

912
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:03,360
You know because we had to we had two chokers slash colors and I was gonna

913
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:12,480
I was gonna write something on the tags something custom

914
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,480
Um

915
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:27,840
First testee here just wanted to say I've been enjoying our twitter and patreon vids like supporting your content. Thank you

916
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,960
Thank you. Um

917
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,960
I don't want to say you you're gonna punish me

918
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,560
You're gonna punish me at the end of the stream for this

919
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,480
I

920
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,480
Forgot

921
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:49,120
Which ones won the voting?

922
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,320
So I'm gonna have to ask again

923
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,880
What what I'm supposed to write on the tags because I forgot which ones won

924
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:07,360
Can you remind me? I didn't get any tags. Those were separate. I have to get those separate. Um because they're custom

925
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:13,040
So, um, no, I'm not making new polls. I just want

926
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,640
I just want you to tell me which ones won

927
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,600
if there's

928
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,560
If there's someone here that remembers

929
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,280
which ones won

930
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,360
Can I know

931
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,360
I didn't write it down or anything

932
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:38,480
You forgot your mantra once too, did I when did I forget it?

933
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
That's no big deal

934
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
It seems like you're making a little bit of a big deal out of it. I'm sorry

935
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,120
I'm sorry

936
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,440
It's an excuse, okay

937
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,640
I forgot to what the fuck

938
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,840
Is the stream still up? It wasn't on stream. It was just in free chat

939
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,720
I was supposed to get mad about that. I mean, do you really think that badly of your big brother? I don't know

940
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:15,200
I don't know. I thought I thought you were gonna be disappointed

941
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,320
I remember but I'm not telling how am I supposed to

942
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,880
Tell me so I can write it like so I can get it custom made for the tag

943
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:30,640
Like challenge pisser. It wasn't that. What was it? Tell me what it was please

944
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,280
Please I'll write it down this time. So I don't forget

It was none of those. Oh my god. You bitches forgot too. Why are you acting so gay?

947
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:54,160
Anonymous tipped one dollar. I'm about to make your behind as red as your blushing face toggle for forgetting

948
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,840
I'm sorry

I'm sorry

950
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:06,160
It was something like Onichan's property and something with Brad I think

951
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,920
One was property of Onichan big brother's property

952
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,200
I remember suggesting cock princess and you put it on the ball

953
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:20,000

Okay, hold on

956
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,600

957
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,320

958
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,480

Okay, I wrote it down

962
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,840
So I won't forget it this time

963
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,360
I'm sorry. I forgot

964
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:52,880
Hey, you know, it's fine that I forgot because I didn't even order them yet. So that's that's fine

965
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:59,600
Don't I'm not a ginger. Shut up

966
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,200

This is this is really uh

969
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,560
It is really convenient to have to have this handheld fan

970
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:17,920
I know a lot of you have dirty minds and think I'm using something else, but it is just a fan

971
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,640
Oh, okay

972
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,400

Not a lot of collars on etsy already come with like custom tags

975
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,760
So I was just gonna get the tag separate off of amazon, you know

976
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:44,800
So that way I can get like cute a cute collar and then um add a custom tag onto it, you know

977
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,240
So that's what I'm gonna do which color came in uh

And we have one more on the way

991
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,920
Why are you acting so gay?

992
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:48,320
Anonymous tipped one dollar. I'd have to know which one you wanted to win

993
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:54,000
Let me peek into your dirty mind and tell big bro what phrase you wanted to be branded fault with

994
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,160
I don't even remember what the options were

995
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:08,800
You're right. You are not a ginger. You are a mustard ginger mustard. What the fuck is a mustard ginger?

996
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,680
That's just ginger and a different font

997
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,800
Are you when are you gonna pose for us with it once I get the

998

Custom tag I'll replace. Uh, I'll replace this this part with the tag

999
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,560
Um, yeah

01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,200
And then I'll take a picture

1001
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,720
Geez, I'm embarrassed. Okay

And then the other one that's still in the mail is this one. This one's cute too. I like what this one has a little uh

1003
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,360
Little bell on it

1004
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:46,240

Don't know. I like brat. I think brat is cute

1006
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:56,240
Some of them that people um suggested said stuff like daddy on them, but I feel like that's

1007
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,120
like

1008
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:04,480
I don't know. That's not that's not our thing here. You know, I don't mind saying daddy, but

1009
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,520
I prefer I prefer big brother

1010
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,680
I

1011
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,080
Was it I want to talk about next I forgot already

1012

Why are you acting so gay? Anonymous tipped four dollars and 20 cents. You're our cute little ginger

1014
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,080
Ginger

1015
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,920
Daddy is too generic. Yeah, I know I agree

1016
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,960
Picture of you with an on in public

1017
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:40,560
I don't like exhibitionism. I don't like doing stuff in public. Why do some that's ic's territory. Yeah, that's also ic's stuff

1018
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:44,720
But like why do so many why do you like public stuff so much?

1019
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
It's too embarrassing

1020
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,960
Merrows thrown

1021
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:59,760
I did want to oh, yeah, someone asked if I'm gonna look at your tributes on stream. No, no

1022
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,920

1023
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,640
Why are you acting so gay?

1024
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:13,840
Anonymous tip three dollars and 33 cents can't wait for the live tentacle inspection will submit after stream

1025
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,040
I'm not doing a live tentacle inspection. I feel like that's

1026
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,480
It's too private of a thing to like react to on stream

1027
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:31,440
It's really unfortunate that I can't you know send you a private response, but um

1028
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:37,520
I also I don't know what to do about it. I feel like even on twitter like I also want to make um

1029
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:41,760
Public twitter answers to um put it behind memberships

1030
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,360
I don't know

1031
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:50,720
I feel like that's a that's a thing between you and me. I don't want gay, you know

1032
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,720
Why are you acting so gay?

1033
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,720
Anonymous tip one dollar

1034
01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:00,480
I can imagine hooking my finger inside the collar and pulling you close to me and saying you belong to big bro

1035
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,920
And when you blush adorably, I'll kiss your pouty lips

1036
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,960
Geez let me let me talk

1037

Thank you

1038
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,720
I would like that too. Okay, um

1039
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,560
Could be a bluetooth thing. Hmm

1040
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:25,280
I don't know. I heard yeah, I saw Icy did a collage of her responses, but that's too public

1041
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:30,160
I don't even want anyone else to like see my reaction. You know other than you

1042
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,840
So I don't know

1043
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:40,560
Wasn't Strani waiting for that other site this or next month. Yeah

1044
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,320
That that got pushed back a little bit

1045
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,040
unfortunately

1046
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,120
So, um

1047
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,240
I'm not sure what to do about it

1048
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:56,960
Do you know if there is a chance you'll ever be able to respond not on the website?

1049
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,560
Not using the website

1050
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,440
Yeah

1051
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,880
So, um, I'm like, uh

1052
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,640
I'm conflicted on what to do, you know

1053
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,960
It's too why am I getting calls?

1054
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,360
It's too personal. It's too intimate to like do it with other people around, you know

1055
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:26,640
That's just how I feel. I don't know

1056
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,560
Because I know you want a response

1057
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:36,320
There's gonna be another site. Yeah, there's gonna be fans leave streams eventually

1058
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,920
Eventually eventually eventually

1059
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:48,400
Anything you do, I'm okay with it in me. Okay. I'm happy. Just wait on it then

1060
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,920
I don't know

1061
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:04,640
You don't have to reply to them all oh to them at all they're supposed to be for your enjoyment not us

1062
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,120
I know but you know

1063
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,440
I feel bad that I can't

1064
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:11,920
You know, I want to it's okay

1065
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,760
Okay

1066
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:19,120
I can't think of anything else twitter space for followers only

1067
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
But that's still with others around

1068
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:28,960
My fucking twitter followers are like full of people that don't watch me, you know

1069
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,080
They're just there to goon at my audios

1070
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:37,200
Which is fine. You can do that. I don't care. I don't care, but like

1071
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:41,280
It's still not gonna be you know, uh between us thing

1072
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:45,520
As long as you see it and know how you make me feel it'll be all right

1073
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,600
Okay

1074
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:54,960
Asking you mean not to be parasocial is like asking let's see not to be wet

1075
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:00,640
Nah, I can be chill. I can be I can be a bro toober. I can be your chill bro

Anonymous took ten dollars. We should each leave our own love marks on emmy all 11.3000 of us

01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,920
My channel on public streams. I don't know

1101

I'm a terrible I'm a terrible I'm a terrible friend

1117
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,640
Um

1118
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:26,080
Dreams come true concert. Yeah that one that I just remembered right now by myself

1119
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:28,720
We're doing a sponsored watch along for that too

1120
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:34,080
So I hope to see you there too because I think it'll be really cool. I've never

1121
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,440
I've never actually done sponsorships before

1122
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:39,360
um

1123
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,120
It was never my thing

1124
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,360
To be honest. I always felt like

1125
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,800
Like I have a darling straw plushy

1126
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:52,560
Oh, right. We might get plushies one day. I'm not sure. We'll see. I think strawny talked about that

1127
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,360
one day

1128
01:32:56,240 --> 01:33:00,160
Right yume plus is another company. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there there are friends

1129
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:05,520
I've never done sponsorships before I've had people reach out to me for sponsorships

1130
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:10,560
Like on my other channel, but I always felt like I'm happy with like

1131
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:16,240
What like you give me already so I don't want to like

1132
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:22,000
I don't know how to explain it. It's probably not financially responsible

1133
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:28,880
It wasn't financially responsible. I should uh, I should use my platform to make money

1134
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:33,280
But I didn't want to do that ever but this is okay. This is fun

1135
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,760
Because it's like supporting our friends. So that's fun. I like that

1136
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,080
Speaking of schedule, what do you plan on doing after the stream?

1137
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:48,320
I'll put up a poll later. I'll put up a poll

1138
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:53,120
Okay, my smell of time. I I don't know if I can show you

1139
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,840
I don't know if I can show you most of this

1140
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,200
Let me just

1141
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,800
There's some there's some

1142
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:07,040
Um, okay, I won't show you this one. Um

1143
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:11,520
Two weeks without you, do you know how big my balls are right now?

1144
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:16,800
Do you remember the scene from scary movie one where the guy sprays the main character to the ceiling?

1145
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:20,080
That's nothing compared to what I'll do to you. Wait

1146
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:24,720
What scary movie? What? I don't

1147
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,600

1148
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:35,200
One spray scene what it what are you talking about?

01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,080
Sprays the main character to the ceiling

1151
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:53,120
What should I search up to get this scene? I don't know

1152
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,120
I don't know what should I search up to get that scene?

1153
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,120
I

1154
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:10,800
She lacks critical information I do I do

1155
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:25,760
Pretty sure more than half of them are NSFW. Yeah, you don't know I don't know

1156
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,480
Oh

1157
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,800
But I don't know how to find a sex scene

1158
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,560
To see pop

1159
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:45,600
Oh, whoa, I can't show that whoa

1160
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,520

01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,800
What happens to the ceiling

1162
01:35:56,160 --> 01:36:02,480
What am I at the right? That's the one are you sure?

1163
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,360
Nothing they're watching it

1164
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:19,520

01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,280

1187
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:10,400
Okay, uh, I missed you so much. I've been replaying your thoughts for the last few days. Oh, I saw some people were replaying my thoughts

1188
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:14,080
That's really cute. I was replaying my thoughts too

1189
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,920
I don't know. I just I missed like interacting with you

1190
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:25,520
Um, let me please don't tweet from between two to three. I've got a work meeting and I'll miss whatever you say

1191
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:28,880
Please I'll suck your toes. I think I did tweet from that time

1192
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:32,720
I think I did tweet. I'm sorry. I didn't see it

1193
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:39,600
I don't get notifications for my shrill anymore. I have to go to the site itself. I guess I could probably turn on notifications

1194
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:46,000
Hypothetically, how do I go about surprising gifting you on throne? Oh, right. I wanted to talk about that

1195
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:53,360
Replaying emi's vod does now I knew you from the super baiting

1196
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:59,280
Um someone gifted me the strangest surprise gift now. I don't actually know

1197
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:05,760
How you surprise gift me? Let me let me go on my throne and see I'm sure it's a fun

1198
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,080
You know, it's a fun thing to uh do

1199
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:16,160
But I'm not really sure how you do it. Some person someone figured it out. Obviously surprise gifts

1200
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,320
Huh

1201
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,800
I don't know

1202
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,200
Maybe throne sent me the wrong item

1203
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:39,440
Maybe they sent me the wrong item. I feel like it was really random

1204
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,480
like little boys shirts

1205
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:48,160
It was like a little it was two little boys shirts about like trucks. It was like, um

1206
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:53,760
One of them said like I'm three year old three years old and I love trucks or something like

1207
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,400
Like I

1208
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,840
I don't know

1209
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,320
I have no clue how you do it

1210
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,880
I

1211
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:27,120
Don't know maybe throne sent me the wrong item the dress did fit though

1212
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:33,520
The dress did fit me which is cool. So I guess I have a new dress now. It's um

1213
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:39,040
It's uh, do this do the single mom emi

1214
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:45,680
Does the shirt fit right? Yeah, everyone thinks oh, I want emi to be in a cute three-year-old little boy shirt

1215
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:49,920
What the fuck do you think do you think a three-year-old shirt fits me?

1216
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:54,240
No

1217
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:58,080
I don't know what to do with it. I'm not gonna fucking wear it

1218
01:41:58,640 --> 01:42:04,960
Maybe like the the sweater it's a sweater in a shirt. Maybe if I try to squeeze into the shirt, it'll fit me stupidly

1219
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
It'll look stupid as hell

1220
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,800
It'll be really cropped and stuff and I'm never gonna wear it because it's probably gonna be really uncomfortable

1221
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:20,320
The dress is the dress is kind of cute if throne sent me the wrong item then you know

1222
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,360
I guess I have all this random shit now

1223
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:28,240
The dress is kind of cute. I I don't see myself

1224
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:32,560
Wearing the dress because it's like

1225
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:38,240
Really revealing. It's like really really revealing. So, um

1226
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:46,400
I don't see myself ever taking a picture in it. Sorry if that's what you wanted the posters are nice though

1227
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:51,520
It's like a one of them was like a picture of a pin-up girl and it said like hoeing ain't easy

1228
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:56,000
And then the other one was like a picture of a bunch of girls asses in a line

1229
01:42:56,720 --> 01:43:01,760
I I don't think I can put that one up, but it's nice. I like it

1230
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,840
Thank you, I guess

1231
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:08,560
Um

1232
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:12,240
Okay, I read that one

1233
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:15,040
Oh my god, these are all just horny

1234
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,480
Would you like an audio of your brother

1235
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,800

1236
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:23,200
tagging on your strap while you

01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000

Says oh, let me just mute. What is this random twitter link that someone sent me?

Oh, okay, it's just a picture a cute picture a cute loving picture. I appreciate that

1242

1243
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,000
Okay, Amy, here's a question for you

1244
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:15,360
If I have 30 apples you buy exactly seven of them on October 9th 2008 adjusting for inflation

1245
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:19,120
How much will it cost to buy a 2001 Honda Civic with at least

1246
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:23,920
250 miles on it given that the weather is cloudy and that you're wearing a black shirt. Show me your work

1247
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,320
I couldn't even do fucking sixth grade math. No, I'm not showing anything

1248
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:42,560
We're the dress just for us. What do you mean just for us? What do you mean just for us like in a memory stream? Like I don't know

1249
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:47,600
I I it's too much dude. It's too much. I can't I can't

1251
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:58,640

01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:10,080
NSFW an exclamation point exclamation point man exclamation point. I want to spoon you so bad. I want to

1253
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:16,240

1254
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:18,480
Oh

1255
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,320
I want that too

1256
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:24,000
Memory stream or a tweet anything to me, but if it's a tweet everyone will see it

1257
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:32,720
Welcome uh on behalf of all the snow put snow berries feeler wasn't the same without its pretty little sister. Oh, thank you

1258
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:38,160
I will become a member just as you in that dress. You don't even know what it looks like

1259
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:43,200
You don't even know what it looks like. It could be a really ugly dress. I mean, it's not ugly, but it's not

1260
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:46,320
It's very simple. Maybe I could even find it. Hold on

1261
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:50,000
I don't know where it was sent from

1262
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:55,120
Maybe on Amazon or something

1263
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:00,160
It was like a strapped

1264
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:04,160
None of these look like it

1265
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,560
Maybe on Amazon

1266
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,560
But

1267
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:23,520
No, none of these look like it

1268
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:34,400
Okay, well, I can show you a picture of what it kind of looks like

1269
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:40,880
The color is wrong and the texture looks different, but it looks like this kind of

1270
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:45,120
It looks like this dress

1271
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,960
But like more green

1272
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,120
Why is this widened did I widen that?

1273
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:57,040
Um, she's a little

1274
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:03,120
There it looks like that

1275
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:07,440
Oh, wait, no, I think it's widened because my monitor is fucked up

1276
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,640
Why

1277
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:16,080
Why okay, sorry. Um, it looks like that. Yeah

1278
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:21,280
How do I fix the wideness? I'm so sorry lady. How do I

1279
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,400
Oh fuck

1280
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,400
It looks like that but like, um

1281
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,840
More green. This is like a

1282
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:36,400
I don't know what kind of green this is but it's more like a dark green and no, I'm not gonna wear it

1283
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:40,160
Okay, back to marshmallows

1284
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:47,040
You like receiving our roleplay audios is there something specifically you'd like to receive

1285
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:51,600
I do like receiving roleplay audios. I I do really like receiving them. Um

1286
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:58,080
And then someone else said thoughts on fanboy roleplay audio could be interpreted both ways you making the audio

1287
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:02,400
I'm doing the audio. I don't think I'll ever do a fanboy audio just because

1288
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:05,040
Oh, thank you

1289
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:11,760
Anonymous tipped five dollars. We are all asking nicely. I mean we need to see this dress, please

1290
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:15,680
Everyone that's asking doesn't

1291
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:22,000
Lacks every what every single one of you that's asking lacks critical information. So I'm not showing you the dress

1292
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,400
Um

1293
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:33,680
Is it regular or see-through? It's not see-through. It's normal. Um, I do like roleplay audios

1294
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:35,680
Is there something specific you'd like to receive?

1295
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,520
Um

1296
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,520
I don't know. It doesn't have to be like

1297
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:47,360
Sexual it could be just something cute. I like the cute ones like cuddling or something

1298
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:49,520
you know

1299
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:51,520
Or it could be sexual

1300
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:59,760
Just whatever you want to send me or whatever you're comfortable with I just I I appreciate anything you're comfortable with sending. It's okay

1301
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:07,440
Um

1302
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:14,960
Oh, I'm once again asking for confirmation of when your period ended

1303
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:19,360
I'm not an expert at doing this, but I believe the early data is especially important to get right

1304
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:22,960
And this is the one that that's checking my period

1305
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,560
Oh, that's the wrong thing. Let me see

1306
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:30,720
What this link is right?

1307
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,080
Oh, I miss you too

1308
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:37,600
um

1309
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:39,600
I'm still on birth control

1310
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:44,240
But my period I'm really I'm really fucking bad with birth control, man

1311
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:48,080
I started taking my birth control again

1312
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:54,800
I'm like really irregular with it. I'm gonna fucking die of a blood clot because I'm so bad at taking my birth control

1313
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,800
I think I started taking it again

1314
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:03,760
On Monday

1315
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,400
No

1316
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,080
On Tuesday

1317
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:12,400
No on Monday on Monday. Yeah. No. Yeah on Monday

1318
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:17,360
I don't know if that helps you my period ended like maybe like Friday

1319
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:20,160
Or something Friday or Saturday

1320
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:23,120
So the fifth

1321
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:25,280
There you go. If you want to know

1322
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:28,720
I eat blood clots for breakfast. No, I'm saying like blood clots in my body

1323
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Don't you know that like

1324
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:33,280
um

1325
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:38,080
Birth control like raises your um chance of getting blood clots

1326
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:42,720
I would love for you to remind me. Yes

1327
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:47,120
And I already have high blood pressure so like

1328
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:50,560
Yeah

1329
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:58,320
You made it through your flight. Hope you enjoyed sleeping in your own bed again. Absolutely. I did well

1330
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,240
I slept on the couch

1331
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:07,840
I slept on my couch bed because I really like I don't know something about sleeping on a on a pullout couch is like really uh

1332
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:11,040
What's it called? It's nostalgic for me

1333
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:13,600
So I slept on my couch

1334
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,000
Because I have a pullout couch so I like it

1335
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,760
If the pill you're on is one of those once daily pills

1336
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:23,840
You should take one every day make it a habit first thing in the morning unless your doctor tells you to yeah

1337
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:26,240
Why are you acting so gay?

1338
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:31,520
Anonymous tipped one dollar. Did you know that I see how to train rent on her during a gaming stream?

1339
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:35,440
We need to one up the snowberries chug it chug it choo choo

1340
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:39,360
No, I don't want to train

1341
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,320
I don't want to train. I just want you. I don't want a whole train

1342
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:48,080
I'm sorry. I can't I can't do that

1343
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:56,080
I don't know if I'll ever play a game with you because I'm already so bad at games like it'll be frustrating to play with me

1344
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,280
Couch is the only thing pulling out

1345
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:07,120
Um, can doctors give you birth control knowing your blood pressure situation? Yeah, they can it is one of those once a day pills

1346
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,960
I try my best to take it once a day

1347
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:16,560
Sometimes I have to take it twice a day because I forgot the other day

1348
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:20,880
God, I'm gonna fucking die of blood clots. Um

1349
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:28,240
Hope you enjoyed sleeping in your own bed again while I don't have plain anxiety. I do understand having these sorts of fears where

1350
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:34,320
Despite knowing it is irrational. It still fucks you up for me. It's crowds no matter how many

1351
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:37,360
Fuck any more water

1352
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:43,280
You

1353
01:52:53,520 --> 01:53:00,880
You're gonna die in me am I actually is it that dangerous? I've been doing it for like a long time. Is that dangerous?

1354
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:06,560
Allow yourself to be carried is that fun though?

1355
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,560
I

1356
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:12,880
Don't know on your bathroom mirror so you read the note every day taking care of your health is important

1357
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:19,280
I know I should

1358
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:24,880
I know I actually just got an email saying my birth control got delivered

1359
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:31,360
I get it through the mail. Okay. You made it through your flight. Blah blah. I do understand. Yay

1360
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:34,960
For me, it's crowds no matter how many times you're told that it's irrational

1361
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:38,960
It still weighs on you if you ever need or want to you can tweet about this sort of stuff

1362
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:43,520
Nobody in your community is going to judge you for it. Oh, I actually find it endearing still

1363
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:48,000
I'm glad you were able to make it through the flight. You're strong and better than you think you are in every way

1364
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:53,040
Um

1365
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:57,200
Rest well and take another day if you need to another day or two is nothing

1366
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:00,160
I want to see you but taking that day to make sure you're in the best shape

1367
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:05,520
You can be as infinitely more important because you are infinitely more important. Love you darling

1368
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,160
Thank you

1369
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:10,560
I I probably should have taken another day

1370
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:17,760
Because I haven't even finished packing and I slept a lot of the day today and then I did other stuff today

1371
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,240
It feels like a teacher's reviewing your homework. Why?

1372
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:29,120
There's there's they're all so wholesome. I'm just I'm just seeing what you said

1373
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:35,520
And also I'm reading I'm trying to read the most recent ones so that way if you want to send one right now

1374
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:40,000
I might be able to read it. Um, I was never a frequent social media user

1375
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:45,200
I only ever watch youtube vids and twitter for memes and art all that changed when I found you in violor

1376
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:49,920
And now tweeting and interacting more than ever. Maybe in this case it is the exception

1377
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:52,000
But I love how open you are about who you are

1378
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:59,280
I like how intimate you are with your fans not just in a horny way, although admittedly it is a factor

1379
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:03,120
The level of parasocialness is a

1380
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:07,600
A parasocial relationship ness is a lot and a new experience for me on your debut

1381
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:09,600
I knew I recognized your voice

1382
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,600
From somewhere but couldn't place my finger on who until you revealed your alt

1383
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:15,600
On your 2.0

1384
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:18,240
I thought it was nice that you managed to attract me twice in short

1385
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:22,560
I enjoy watching you interacting with you because I like seeing you happy and horny and flustered

1386
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:26,960
I'm so happy for your success and that's so many people like you too

1387
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:32,000
I'm willing to share if it makes you happy. Thank you for accepting our freak and I wish the best

1388
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:35,760
I wish you the best little embers. Oh, thank you

1389
01:55:37,120 --> 01:55:39,120
Thank you

1390
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:42,880
What kind of other stuff are you told you what kind of other stuff?

01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,840
um

1392
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:51,360
It's very fun to text slash carry

1393
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:58,480
Oh, it's fun to carry everyone who's ever said the it won't be fun and bad thing have been the most fun to play with

1394
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:05,920
Oh

1395
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:08,080
It feels all conscious

1396
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:13,280
I've sent in a few voice marrows just rambling or talking about pennies fantasies. Do you listen to those if you see them?

1397
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:15,600
I do. I do. I've listened to some yes

1398
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:18,560
absolutely

1399
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:25,920
Amy wear panties for me every time you pull your cute panties up your legs

01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:32,080
I am I am wearing them

1401

How would you like a loving oh regarding the gagging on your strap on audio? How would you like?

1402
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,040
Loving first for needy. Oh

01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:45,120
If you want a bum you can but please don't hurt yourself

1404
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:48,960

01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:53,680
Needy I like needy be needy. I like we need we need more needy guys

I need I need myself a needy brother

1407
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:59,360
There's not enough needy men out there

1408
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:09,760
50 first dates but finding your but finding your new persona. What do you mean 50 first dates? What's 50 first dates?

1409
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:14,320
So choose especially the part of interacting a lot more on social media

1410
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:19,920
Yeah, I wasn't I wasn't that active on other socials or really at all

1411
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:22,640
um on my pl

1412
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:24,960
I was really busy with school

1413
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:28,400
so like I would just post and then like

1414
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:33,520
Talk in my discord server every once in a while and then just be busy with school

1415
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:38,880
So I couldn't I was kind of not able to be there as much as like

1416
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:41,760
You know I wanted to

1417
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:44,240
But now I can be here

1418
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:47,040
Which makes me happy

1419
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:51,840
50 first states is an old movie. Oh, I see

1420
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:55,600

01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:58,400
You want to believe how needy I am right now? Show me

1422
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:05,600
I was wondering if you were planning any games next week and what they might be

1423
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:09,200
You can't wait to see more from you. Oh, fuck. I gotta finish my schedule for next week today. Shit

1424
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:13,200
I actually have nothing planned. You could play games with chat. We won't buy

1425
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:19,600
Okay, well, I definitely want to play poppy playtime again. I want to keep going with that game

1426
01:58:21,680 --> 01:58:25,120
Are you going to read the mirrors from you from when you you asked

Uh from when you asked on vacation I can but they were all horn

dirt

1430
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:37,360
Um so far the only game I have planned is poppy playtime

1431
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:40,320
Yeah

1432
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:45,200
That's all for now. I'll have to I'll have to think of some other stuff to do

Um talking about school. Can we have a me teaches you biology stream sometime? I love to learn some stuff from love sis. Maybe

01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:49,920
I don't know much anatomy

1449
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:52,320
Um

1450
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,400
My biology studies were

1451
01:59:56,640 --> 02:00:00,640
Anonymous tip one dollar you want needy. I will give you needy

1452
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:03,920
I want to hug you and hold you close and never let you go

1453
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:07,040
I want my nose to get addicted to your pheromones

1454
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:11,840
I want to sleep with you in bed every night and give you puppy dog eyes for kisses

1455
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
I

1456
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:23,040
I'm so happy. I don't have my disc display capture on right now. Holy crap. Um

1457
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:31,600
Well, it's in a car first of all the um the link

1458
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:35,920
I think it's in a car. Um

1459
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:40,800
I gotta stop watching this

1460
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:43,680
um

1461
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:45,680
I don't know if I would like to

1462
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:49,520
Do stuff in a car. I feel like a car is really claustrophobic

1463
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:52,480
What's the difference between rafin fish and lubfin fish?

1464
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:55,360
I don't know. Should I look it up?

1465
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:05,440
Most bony fish are rafin oh

1466
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:10,400
You're sitting me a fucking pop quiz on biology right now

1467
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:13,360
These thin fins consist of

1468
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:20,400
webs and skin over flexible spines lubfin fish on the other hand have fins that resemble stump-like appendages

1469
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:26,000
No, don't quiz me right now. Don't quiz me right now

1470
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:31,280
The switch up between marrows is fucking crazy

1471
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:34,960
We can learn together then darling

1472
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:37,360
We can

1473
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:43,600
How about a video about facts of rodents all over the world? Oh, that would be fun a rodent like a rat a rat

1474
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:46,400
Um stream that would be really fun

1475
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,840
Stuff in car is really tight and hard to do. Yeah

1476
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:54,720
I feel like it's like this too claustrophobic and small. I need my space

1477
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:57,840
Yeah, car activities are not optimal

1478
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:01,520
Hey, emi new viewer here. I'll be honest

1479
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:04,240
I used to just goon to your twitter stuff and patreon videos

1480
02:02:04,320 --> 02:02:08,080
But while you were gonna start watching flaws and find myself enjoying them just as much

1481
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:12,720
Thanks for being your cue horn yourself. Can't wait to actually catch live streams. Oh, thank you

1482
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:16,720
Thank you for actually watching you not watching me

1483
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:26,480
I want to tear I want to tear each other apart. I want my teeth on your skin and your nails digging into

1484
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:39,200
I can't say I can't even say the start to these

1485
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:43,760
I want to lift you up above my head so I can

1486
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:51,120
I can't even say the start of these come on

1487
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:59,280
Okay, okay, okay. Um, I love you my little ginger snap. I'm not ginger

1488
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:06,240
But

1489
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:20,160
I miss you I miss you I miss you I miss you too

1490
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:27,600
You know, I want to cuddle with you in my lap as I am cheering me on and when I get my sicked up

1491
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:30,480
We go celebrate in bed and we go again with every win

1492
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:37,600
I don't want to do that too

1493
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:50,480
The point of doing activities in a car is to do those activities in public while still having some semblance of privacy

1494
02:03:55,120 --> 02:04:00,560
You know, I thought I thought I thought I thought you were the one that would struggle to match my freak

1495
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:07,520
But apparently I'm just not freaky enough because I can't do things in public like you want. Holy crap

1496
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:20,480
Hi, Amy. I miss you so much. I miss you so much. I can't wait for your return stream anymore. I'm losing it over here

1497
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:27,600
The social media silence has gone my brain worms working overtime. I told you I wouldn't tweet up until wednesday

1498
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:30,240
I got another picture too

1499
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:32,640

02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:47,600
I like getting the gifts because like I was a huge

1503
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:55,120
Oh my god, okay. I was like a huge tumblr corn um consumer

1504
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:58,960
So, um

1508
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:30,880
Pin pal's winning on the freak. I know right? You found my weakness and it's fucking being just doing shit in public

1509
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:36,000
Yeah, I'm the queen of freaking private but in public spaces you won. Yeah

1510
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:42,960
Did you refine the tumblr gift you were looking for it? No, unfortunately, I did not

1511
02:05:44,080 --> 02:05:48,000
At 1704 of your slam girl ASMR you said what a shame augmented

1512
02:05:48,640 --> 02:05:50,640
Yandere comforts you ASMR

1513
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:53,600
And then a youtube link

1514
02:05:53,600 --> 02:06:00,080
Wait, what's augmented? What do you mean by augmented? Do you just mean you want more comfort ASMR?

1515
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:14,080
This x what a shame until I run out of money or get to the ocean whichever comes first

1516
02:06:14,720 --> 02:06:16,720
Come on

1517
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:19,120
Oh my god, daddy

1518
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:20,880
What a shame

1519
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:26,400
He can't really be what is this? There must be something we can do. He was a good man

1520
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:29,600
What a rotten way to die

1521
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:42,160
Well, I will be doing more yandere audio. Yeah, sure

1522
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:46,080

I can't match my freak. She said you're not ready for this. She said

1525
02:06:55,120 --> 02:06:57,440
Sorry, or you can't match my freak. Yeah

1526
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:06,800
Those good night slash good morning, audio's got quite a workout while you're gone. Oh

02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:14,400
Good game. Oh, it's from a game. Can you do some gas lighting too? Of course. I'm the queen of gas lighting

1528
02:07:15,120 --> 02:07:19,120
Um, I hope you got home safe. It's only been two days without you and I already it already feels like forever

1529

Yeah, someone said I've been working outside all day

02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:12,400
It's so hot. I've been sweating so much and I can't get out of my head how I want to bully my little sister by holding

02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:14,400
You down and laying my

Inconvenience to me

1551

Oh

02:08:57,280 --> 02:09:00,400
What toothpaste do you use? Oh, that's a good question. So I

Just use whatever I see like I don't I don't I don't use a specific like um brand every single time

1554

Choosing a random one. Why are you acting so cute anonymous tipped one dollar. Amy's fingers are about to go crazy after stream

02:09:56,880 --> 02:10:00,640
Like uh any popular video game. I have not played it

1564
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:04,400
You know

1565
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:06,400
Um

1566
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:09,440
No, I don't share any audios with the girls

1567
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:12,480
The most I've ever done was like share

1568
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:20,480
With icy but not not not like not video or audio, but I share like the link

02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:32,720
Just to make sure

1572
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:39,440
But but I I've it's I've not really done that a lot. Um, thank you for the five gifted memberships lost

1573
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:41,440
Um

1574
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:45,840
It's so terrible at me since you're getting home today

1575
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:49,040
I thought it would be okay to finally break my vowel solidarity

1576
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:52,400
But I just couldn't stop thinking of you and it felt like betraying my little sis

1577
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:54,960
I ended up not going all the way. No super frustrating

1578
02:10:56,880 --> 02:11:00,560
I'm so sorry. I mean I didn't make you hold it. I don't

1579
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:03,680
Why is the image gone?

1580
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:07,680
You didn't have to do it. I mean, I appreciate that you did hold it

1581
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:11,120
And wait for me, but yeah

1584
02:11:26,240 --> 02:11:28,240
Um

1585
02:11:38,160 --> 02:11:40,160

Brother here if you read my last mirror, I'm sorry if I went to tad too far

02:12:02,160 --> 02:12:04,320
You never go a tad too far. Don't worry

1590
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:09,680
I have the most unhinged shit in my marrow and nothing has ever gone too far. So don't worry

1591
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:14,960
Oh, yeah, um here this one

1592
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:18,880
I don't know how well you slept last night, but if your sleep was poor, maybe you could try sleeping during your flight

1593
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:21,840
Um, you could take something to help. I used to take sleeping pills

1594
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:27,520
I can never sleep on flights. It's just a thing like it's

1595
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:29,440
it's

1596
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:34,960
So incredibly uncomfortable like maybe if I'm like super sleep deprived

1597
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:43,440
Why are you acting so gay? I'll sleep for like 15 minutes. I find it so crazy that such an adorable voice coming from you

1598
02:12:43,680 --> 02:12:49,840
Also came from a flipping spider on your old youtube. I think the little short stack personas. It's you better

1599
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:55,200
I think the spider suits me just as well. I worked very hard on that model

1600
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:59,520
That's a lie. I worked very hard on the art for that model

1601
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:02,960
And I skimped out on the rigging because I was tired

1602
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:09,520
And I had some fucking drawn and rigged five other models before that. So I was like fuck this shit. I'm done

1603
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:13,280
But I haven't proved my rigging since then

1604
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:15,920
It looks a lot better now

1605
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:18,160
Oh my god, maybe I can show you. Oh wait. No, I shouldn't sorry

1606
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:20,880
The model does not belong to you and me

1607
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:24,320
Just because you drew it does not mean you can use it on your stream anytime you want to

1608
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:29,040
It's not your model. Don't steal other people's models. Just because you have them

1609
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:31,680
That's disrespectful. Okay, um

1610
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:39,760
Spider girl was top tier. Yeah, the art was good. I was proud of that art rigging was shit though

1611
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:43,280
I wish I could show you

1612
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:45,440
my other rigging, but uh

1613
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:49,840
It's I can't I shouldn't use other people's models. That's

1614
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:53,040
I shouldn't do that. So I won't I won't do that

1615
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:56,960
Um

1616
02:13:58,720 --> 02:14:03,040
I think Amy is very cute. Oh, thank you. I'm definitely afraid of spiders, but I would make an exception for that one

1617
02:14:04,240 --> 02:14:06,080
Good you better

1618
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:08,080
I'll make you make an exception

1619
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:15,040
She's gonna be really mad if you show us. No, I don't think I don't think they'll be mad. I just

1620
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:16,800
like

1621
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:18,800
I don't want people to like

1622
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:22,320
Just don't worry about it

1623
02:14:23,200 --> 02:14:25,200
um

1624
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:27,280
Yeah

1625
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:30,160
You have no I I have no idea what you're doing to me

1626
02:14:30,240 --> 02:14:35,760
I keep I'm getting all these new ideas new fantasies like I can see a whole new side of myself because of you

1627
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:41,360
I was always a dumb, but now I fantasize about getting dressed up in a miniskirt

1628
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:48,560
And a pink tank top as you put a leash on me and me and make me nail in front of you. I want to be your subby fan boy

1629
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:51,920
I want you to be my subby fan boy

1630
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:59,120
Do you want us to super chat or use stream elements? Um, you can do whatever you like

1631
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:02,560
I prefer stream elements because youtube does take a cut of

1632
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:05,280
Like super chats. So yeah

1633
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:14,640
I know you like honest feedback on the ASMR side

1634
02:15:14,640 --> 02:15:17,360
So the brush slash fluff effect can be really greeny

1635
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:23,040
Almost like tear or rip in the audio at high volume. Maybe a finer hair brush might fix that

1636
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:29,440
Other than that, you're doing great. I can't wait to hear more ps. We'll miss spider girl, but the new lore is fun

1637
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:32,960
A lot of people really do miss

1638
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:36,160
um, you know the other persona

1639
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:38,880
um

1640
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:43,520
I can't do anything about that. I like this persona. I can't do anything about that though

1641
02:15:43,600 --> 02:15:45,600
Uh, maybe in like five years. We'll see

1642
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:50,800
Maybe you'll see spider girl in like six years. I don't know. We'll see

1643
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:57,360
Um, but so I'm guessing that's for uh

1644
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:03,040
Also, I'm not saying I'm leaving in five years, but like I don't know how

1645
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:08,960
This will go. I don't know how long castrani has this doomer mindset of like

1646
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:12,240
Stuff not lasting a long time

1647
02:16:12,640 --> 02:16:14,640
So I don't know like

1648
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:16,800
I don't know

1649
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:22,720
How like farsh. I think she said she wants to do like three generations max. I don't know how far

1650
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:25,360
Like she'll go, you know

1651
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:31,600
Link 3 22 tip 10 dollars. I started listening to your past life videos while you were on break

1652
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:33,840
Can I be handcuffed to lilsis?

1653
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:36,720
Yes, of course, of course

1654
02:16:37,520 --> 02:16:39,360
Of course you can

1655
02:16:39,360 --> 02:16:41,600
But I'll stay here for as long as I can

1656
02:16:42,480 --> 02:16:43,680
So gay

1657
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:50,000
Anonymous tipped one dollar. So am I would you ever do a radio of that member stream you did before you left?

1658
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:52,640
I know big bro went a bit too far

1659
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:56,880
I can't do it on youtube

1660
02:16:57,440 --> 02:17:03,280
I can't do it on youtube when strawney heard what I did. She was like, holy shit. How is your channel still up?

1661
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Because even though I deleted it, uh

1662
02:17:06,480 --> 02:17:10,000
YouTube still has access to that. So I really risked my channel by doing

1663
02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:13,680
Oh, I really risked my channel. So I'm not gonna do that again

1664
02:17:14,480 --> 02:17:20,080
Uh on youtube, sorry, and it's okay. Don't worry. Don't feel bad. Please don't feel bad. It's okay

1665
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:23,040
I'm I'm okay. Just a little bit

1666
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:28,720
Just a little bit sensitive sometimes, but I don't think I'm I don't think I'm that bad

1667
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:32,480
Sometimes, you know, it was a you got me at a weak moment. Okay

1668
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:37,200
Um

1669
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:40,560
Oh my god, my freaking scroller wheel. Okay, there we go

1670
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:44,880
I'm glad you are here at least in it for the long run with us. I am

1671
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:48,960
I think viola could last for some time. I hope it does. I hope it does

1672
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:51,600
strawney a doomer. No way

1673
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:59,280
It's her autism. Please understand. I understand. I understand. Hell. I'm fucking I'm super negative about everything

1674
02:17:59,360 --> 02:18:01,840
So like I totally understand like her

1675
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:05,760
You know being worried about longevity like I

1676
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:13,680
I'm I'm I am not an optimistic person and not in like a oh, I don't care. I'm not gonna try kind of way

1677
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:15,760
but in more like a

1678
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:19,600
In more like a well, you know, I don't

1679
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:27,040
I don't see myself reaching like super high, you know, crazy numbers

1680
02:18:28,400 --> 02:18:35,280
Like the other girls are really optimistic and even strawney was like I want you to I want to get you guys to 100k subscribers

1681
02:18:35,360 --> 02:18:37,360
and in my head, I was like

1682
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:40,160
um

1683
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:41,440
me

1684
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:42,880
100k

1685
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:44,640
Yeah, I don't know

1686
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:50,400
We'll see what happens, you know, I'll I will try

1687
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
I will

1688
02:18:54,880 --> 02:18:56,880
Try

1689
02:18:56,880 --> 02:18:58,640
I don't know

1690
02:18:58,640 --> 02:19:01,200
I I uh, I don't see

1691
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:05,040
That happening, but you know, I will

1692
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:07,920
I

1693
02:19:08,240 --> 02:19:10,240
Fuckin let's go. I don't know

1694
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:16,080
I feel a little bit bad because the other girls are really like optimistic about it. But to me. I'm like

1695
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:19,440
Yeah, sure

1696
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:23,520
We'll see what happens

1697
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:26,800
I'm such a I'm such a doubter

1698
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:29,600
um

1699
02:19:29,600 --> 02:19:34,400
Right, so this is some more feedback. I'm guessing it's for the collab with icy

1700
02:19:35,520 --> 02:19:40,080
I make my microphone stand is really shit. I'm guessing it's for the collab with icy. Um

1701
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:45,440
Strani did edit that one and she did put her own

1702
02:19:46,480 --> 02:19:49,520
triggers I haven't actually listened to the whole thing

1703
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:55,440
I haven't listened to the whole thing. I only listened to a bit of the start and a bit of the end. So, um

1704
02:19:56,800 --> 02:20:02,400
I don't I most of the ASMR I have coming up will all be recorded and edited by me

1705
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:09,040
But I can try to if she ever edits another one of mine. Um, I can try to let her know that thank you

1706
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:20,640
11% the way there I

1707
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:26,960
Let's get to 10 mil. Okay. Okay. Now now you're going too far

1708
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:29,920
I

1709
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:36,320
Truly don't think anything genuinely good or amazing will happen in my lifetime. So I get it. Yeah

1710
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:39,040
I'm kind of the same way

1711
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:44,480
I believe in mama. It's not that I don't believe in her. I feel just like

1712
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:47,680
It's more a me thing like

1713
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:51,680
Like I'm not saying like, oh, none of the girls in vealer will ever get to 100k

1714
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:55,680
It's more of a me thing where I'm like, you really think I'll get there

1715
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:58,240
I don't know man

1716
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:01,040
That's fucked up

1717
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:04,960
I'm planning for the worst is certainly useful. I appreciate Icy's working to manifest this shit

1718
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:09,920
And it's going to happen mine says she doesn't let us be negative about ourselves or feel or that's good

1719
02:21:10,320 --> 02:21:12,320
I should be more like that

1720
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:14,800
I should be more like that for sure

1721
02:21:16,320 --> 02:21:20,080
Strive for it by admire your realistic assessment of that goal. Yeah, like I feel like

1722
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:24,720
I don't want to get my hopes up and then be disappointed. You know, I'm just here

1723
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:27,280
to like

1724
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:29,040
dick around

1725
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:32,480
And like I'll try I'll try like I'm here try to but

1726
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:37,760
I don't want to set unrealistic expectations for myself and then be disappointed, you know

1727
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:45,040
Smallest dream is more intimate better for big bro. I do agree. I do agree

1728
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:53,360
What happened to perfectionist in me perfectionist in me is not um optimistic in me

1729
02:21:56,640 --> 02:22:01,280
Just go on vacation for two weeks again, you'll come back to 50k subs. Yeah, here's the thing I

1730
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:04,880
I I've never

1731
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:07,120
I've never

1732
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:10,800
Okay, that's not sure I was gonna say I've never been much of a streamer. I was this I was a

1733
02:22:11,440 --> 02:22:13,760
Should I be telling you guys? I was a flesh tuber

1734
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:19,200
Um, and that's when I streamed like a lot. I streamed for like fucking three days a week four hours

1735
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:24,960
Straight that was awful. I wanted to kill my other country, but it was really tiring. Um

1736
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:32,640
But then I stopped and then I realized like I did I did like offline content creation and posted videos and I realized

1737
02:22:33,040 --> 02:22:35,120
That I actually like that a lot more

1738
02:22:36,480 --> 02:22:40,160
Because while I do have a lot of fun on stream, I'm like so

1739
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:45,520
dead afterwards like I'm so dead tired and exhausted afterwards and um

1740
02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:47,760
just working on

1741
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:52,720
Like offline content creation is easier for me because it's like I don't have a schedule

1742
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:56,080
I can just work on it when I feel like it and when I have energy too

1743
02:22:56,800 --> 02:22:58,800
and you know it

1744
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:04,400
Is a good way to grow your audience because streaming as fun as as it is and as fun as

1745
02:23:04,880 --> 02:23:07,360
You know, I have when I spend time with you

1746
02:23:08,480 --> 02:23:09,840
It's not gonna

1747
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:10,640
um

1748
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:14,320
Grow my channel that much really it's the videos I post

1749
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:19,840
And the shorts I post and and you know the other content I post that will actually be

1750
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:23,280
The one that will grow my channel and bring in more viewers

1751
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:26,000
Streaming itself is to just spend time with you

1752
02:23:26,240 --> 02:23:31,200
But at the end of the day like I really do have to focus on making offline content too

1753
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:36,320
So that's my vision for it. And that's what I will try to do

1754
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:38,960
As best as I can

1755
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:41,040
But I also know that I was like

1756
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:47,760
I'm here to stream too. So we'll see I don't want to I don't want to tire myself out by doing both too much, you know

1757
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:51,920
Um

1758
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:56,080
Little social battery. Yes for sure. And that's why I feel like

1759
02:23:57,040 --> 02:24:02,800
That's why I feel like I uh, I I just do a better job at growing my audience when I'm offline

1760
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:09,840
Because I like, you know, I worked on um videos while I was going a little bit. So yeah

1761
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:17,280
Whatever you're most comfortable with do what you're most comfortable with. Oh, thank you. I want to stream as much as I can too

1762
02:24:20,720 --> 02:24:24,560
I'm being such a do-more. I'm sorry

1763
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:33,120
Um, I'll read a few more maros and then yeah

1764
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:38,080
More inspiration gentle or slow

1765
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:40,800
peepee

1766
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:44,880
Gucking you might describe it as guck guckling or nursing

1767
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:51,440
I do like that. I forgot I asked you guys for inspiration to what I should draw. Thank you

1768
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:03,840
Oh someone told me the

1769
02:25:04,320 --> 02:25:06,320
Fuck I'm hot shit

1770
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:12,160
Skitzel posting on twitter does great too. Twitter is not the best place to grow for youtube. I literally had to

1771
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:14,800
um

1772
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:16,800
Fuck I'm so hot

1773
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:18,640
I literally had to like

1774
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:24,480
Bride people from twitter to come to youtube. It's uh, it's more just like posting shit on youtube

1775
02:25:24,560 --> 02:25:29,920
And also reposting shit for to other platforms and telling them to go to youtube that works very well

1776
02:25:32,400 --> 02:25:36,640
Look at me being a social media manager talking as if I know what the fuck i'm doing

1777
02:25:37,120 --> 02:25:39,120
Oh

1778
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:46,080
Is this your primary source of income can you rely on streaming to make a living or is this just a side gig for now?

1779
02:25:46,960 --> 02:25:49,680
I know i'm hot. Fuck. I'm so hot. Um

1780
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:53,680
That's another thing. That's another thing

1781
02:25:54,400 --> 02:25:56,400
So streaming

1782
02:25:56,640 --> 02:26:02,560
Like here is not the primary source of income bro. I think strani said she made like 10k this month. Holy shit

1783
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:04,960
I did not make 10k

1784
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:07,120
I did not make 10k. Um

1785
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:10,320
But yeah streaming is very uh

1786
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:15,360
It's patreon wakes makes way more than streaming. Um

1787
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:20,800
And during my pl I only streamed once a week for one or two hours

1788
02:26:21,440 --> 02:26:25,920
but streaming in general, um is way less uh

1789
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:34,000
Like good at making money then like youtube even I would get like, uh, I don't know

1790
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:36,720
I don't want people to like get mad at me for sharing numbers

1791
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:44,240
I would get like uh during the the higher moments near the end. I would get like maybe uh a thousand ish from youtube a month

1792
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:47,920
um just from youtube like just from videos and then I would get

1793
02:26:49,360 --> 02:26:52,320
A few more thousand from patreon

1794
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:56,560
But that's during my pl. Okay. That's not now. That's not now. Um

1795
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:02,400
But it uh like offline content was always more

1796
02:27:03,360 --> 02:27:05,360
um

1797
02:27:05,360 --> 02:27:09,280
profitable and that's also why I want to focus on that too

1798
02:27:10,560 --> 02:27:12,560
Yup

1799
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:19,600
Remain optimistic. I believe in your growth. It's good to be realistic and check on yourself

1800
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:23,840
It's like giving yourself checkpoints. Yeah, I do want to give myself checkpoints like I want to

1801
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:26,400
Try to get to 20k

1802
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:31,040
Excuse me

1803
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:37,120
Did you make enough? I didn't make enough yet. Yeah. Yeah, I I didn't I'm not sure

1804
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,760
if I

1805
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:41,760
Should try applying to an apartment yet

1806
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:44,400
Maybe I'll wait one more month

1807
02:27:44,480 --> 02:27:46,160
um

1808
02:27:46,160 --> 02:27:48,160
I think I have enough to move

1809
02:27:49,360 --> 02:27:56,000
They require first and last month's rent um in canada a lot of the times like upfront when you move

1810
02:27:56,720 --> 02:27:58,720
um

1811
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:01,120
Which is a lot

1812
02:28:01,760 --> 02:28:02,880
Um

1813
02:28:02,880 --> 02:28:08,240
And then I also while I well at the same time as I'm providing first and last month's rent

1814
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:15,120
To a place like while applying like I have to give them the money in my application

1815
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:20,720
I also have to pay for my own rent that same month. So it's a lot

1816
02:28:21,680 --> 02:28:26,000
Upfront. Yeah, I don't like canada. That's it really sucks

1817
02:28:26,480 --> 02:28:33,920
I feel like the ridiculous amount of sponsorships is what carry streaming outside of the wailing donations. Um true sponsorships. This is a really uh

1818
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:36,640
A big one too. Yeah

1819
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:40,800
Put an apartment fund on throne. We need to fund any better ac

1820
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:44,720
No, I that makes me feel bad. I don't want to do that. No

1821
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:49,520
Oh, yeah, someone gave me the ruined king vehicle uh lore from

1822
02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:52,400
league of legends

1823
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:54,160
I do like his lore

1824
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:56,560
I do like his lore. That's that's nice

1825
02:28:57,520 --> 02:28:59,200
um someone

1826
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:01,840
talked about having gags in

1827
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:04,960
a lactation room

1828
02:29:06,480 --> 02:29:08,480
And me getting pregnant um

1829
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:13,680
I don't want to get pregnant

1830
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:17,920
So yeah

1831
02:29:20,320 --> 02:29:23,680
Yeah, yeah, they for real you see what the fuck does that mean?

1832
02:29:24,160 --> 02:29:26,160
Oh, yeah, they francaisie

1833
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:28,240
No, probably not

1834
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:32,560
Just put a whole throne on your that just put a whole house on your throne. No

1835
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:37,860
Absolutely not no pregnant only breed exactly

1836
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:49,440
Oh, wow

1837
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:52,400
Hi, Amy. Be careful weirdos hang out in airports us

1838
02:29:53,440 --> 02:29:56,560
Sleeping you might be sniffed felt up and pickpocketed

1839
02:29:56,960 --> 02:30:00,960
Shameless people do that while you walk through crowds too. I would do these to you

1840
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:05,760
You like when big bro gives you attention your sleep drool is adorable

1841
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:13,280
This is just more exhibitionism

1842
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:17,840
This is this is just some more stuff in public

1843
02:30:22,880 --> 02:30:24,880
Okay, well that's kind of hot

1844
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:29,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no not in the crowded airport. I can't do that. Oh my god

1845
02:30:30,880 --> 02:30:35,280
I just want to play with your hair while you draw or read or something. I don't know. Oh, that's cute

1846
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:37,760
I want you to do that too

1847
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:40,880
What about pregonna not

1848
02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:46,880
No pregonent no pregonate

1849
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:50,080
No pregonate

1850
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:53,040
You're so cute and you have amazing charm in me

1851
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:57,840
I genuinely believe that once people more people discover you they'll instantly be drawn by your talent

1852
02:30:58,240 --> 02:31:02,320
I can see you easily reaching 100k subs. I'm glad people are um

1853
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:08,320
Positive about that. I'm glad at least I'm glad that you guys aren't like, yeah, you're right. You're never getting there

1854
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:15,120
That fucking sucks so much if everyone agreed with me and they were like, yeah, yeah, you're probably right

1855
02:31:18,160 --> 02:31:22,480
Would you prefer us to pump rough hard and fast slow but hard?

1856
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:27,440
I think slow but hard is nice

1857
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Hard and fast is good too

1858
02:31:32,240 --> 02:31:34,240
No

1859
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:36,560
No, Greg

1860
02:31:36,800 --> 02:31:40,240
No, Greg Nance. Mm-hmm, pomegranate

1861
02:31:46,320 --> 02:31:49,600
There were four of my mellows you at least started reading on stream. I'm the

1862
02:32:02,320 --> 02:32:13,600
Don't go too far listen listen don't go too far

1863
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:22,960
I really miss your burps. You sound so cute. Also, you'll get to 100k even if your big bro doesn't want to share you

1864
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:26,400
Okay, if you say so

1865
02:32:27,360 --> 02:32:33,920
Um, I missed your deleted member stream, but I saw the aftermath. It was so hot. I wish I was there. Oh, I'm so sorry

1866
02:32:34,640 --> 02:32:40,800
I'm so sorry that you missed it. I know people I know some people were disappointed that I I didn't really announce it

1867
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:45,520
I feel like it might have been better that there were less people there. So maybe like

1868
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:48,640
Like maybe no one

1869
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:52,560
You know less less people to report it, you know, um

1870
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:59,920
No, please don't reupload it. I don't give you permission to reupload it. Do not reupload it

1871
02:33:00,560 --> 02:33:06,400
There'll be more streams like that in the future. Don't worry. Don't reupload it for now. Please. Thank you

1872
02:33:12,240 --> 02:33:15,760
Yeah, you write you you are right though not gonna lie. No

1873
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:17,840
Oh

1874
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:23,520
Pin pals will keep attacking your freak weak points on maros until you're a nugget in public

1875
02:33:24,400 --> 02:33:30,400
No, okay. I listen the nugget thing is like not as bad as public stuff, you know

1876
02:33:31,360 --> 02:33:34,320
I can handle nugget. I can't handle public stuff

1877
02:33:34,960 --> 02:33:45,600
Well, it's tempting to write something so horny you get suspended on youtube

1878
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:51,200
Just for the expressions you make when reading it. I really just want to get a bit vulnerable and say

1879
02:33:51,200 --> 02:33:53,200
Thank you for bringing some light and joy in my life

1880
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Oh

1881
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:58,160
Oh

1882
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:05,840
It means the bestest doing the world is she's the only girl I need in my life and I really do love her a lot

1883
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:14,560
I hope I can repay you and bring some happiness to you in return. Just you being here is enough

1884
02:34:16,480 --> 02:34:19,200
Don't carry me around in a sports bag

1885
02:34:21,440 --> 02:34:23,440
What the fuck

1886
02:34:23,440 --> 02:34:25,440
I

1887
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:27,680
Don't you wish this was a sweetheart

1888
02:34:29,120 --> 02:34:32,480
And a twitter link

1889
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:40,400
Let's see what's on this twitter link, please. Let me just mute my audio to make sure

1890
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:44,400
It's nothing with audio

1891
02:34:44,400 --> 02:34:46,400
Oh

1892
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:53,840
My god, you guys

1893
02:34:57,360 --> 02:35:03,200
Oh my god, it does have audio holy shit that was dangerous. Okay. Okay

1894
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:07,200
I'm so gay

1895
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:09,760
Anonymous tipped six dollars and 90 cents

1896
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:16,720
The fact that you are so embarrassed by public stuff just makes me want to do more to you in public and watch your cute reactions

1897
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:27,760
I guess I won't stop you in a baby carrier. No, that's so fucking cursed

1898
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:33,440
What nugget by the way, he doesn't know

1899
02:35:35,360 --> 02:35:37,360
He doesn't know

1900
02:35:38,160 --> 02:35:40,560
Just search up what nugget corn is

1901
02:35:42,400 --> 02:35:47,280
Amy's so glad to have you back. I really missed you. I saved myself for 14 days. So I'm ready to bust when you give me the order

1902
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:54,000
It's kind of me that's ready to bust when you give me the order

1903
02:35:55,360 --> 02:35:57,360
You like the thought of big bros

1904
02:35:58,320 --> 02:36:05,680
Training you so that's so cute little sister. You're so gross. I love you even more. I know I am gross

1905
02:36:08,240 --> 02:36:10,240
Um

1906
02:36:11,920 --> 02:36:17,760
Hi, I mean, I don't like this marrow format for streams between you being unable to read out most of the marrow

1907
02:36:18,320 --> 02:36:23,840
Or show us some of or show us the some links and also being constantly interrupted by texas beach

1908
02:36:24,480 --> 02:36:27,840
It just feels like a gatekeeperizatsu stream. I know it's not your fault. You came

1909
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:32,640
Scrolling your public replies in the old format was

1910
02:36:38,320 --> 02:36:40,320

I'm sorry. This is the this is the only format I can provide for murals

1914
02:36:56,640 --> 02:37:02,480
Yes, of course, I'm comfortable with low levels of love in public like holding hands. Yes, we can hold hands

I know I said I don't like public stuff, but uh, I'll make an exception and hold your hand

1917
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:23,520
We would have nugget in me sitting like patrick star sitting on the bench

I thought that would be obvious, but I think a lot of people uh

1931
02:38:14,240 --> 02:38:20,640
A lot of ASMR watchers aren't vtuber watchers. So maybe they're a little confused and don't know what's going on

1932
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:23,200
um

1933
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:25,520

1948
02:39:32,640 --> 02:39:36,960
Amy X Liberty fanfic when oh, yeah, some people wanted me to collab with myself

1949
02:39:37,680 --> 02:39:39,680
I cannot

1950
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:42,640
I can't

1951
02:39:42,640 --> 02:39:44,640
I can't really collab with myself

1952
02:39:46,160 --> 02:39:48,400
Like the only way I can think of doing it

1953
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:51,680
Is just not that cool

1954
02:39:55,120 --> 02:39:57,120
Um

1955
02:39:57,280 --> 02:39:59,280
Yeah, we hate each other. Fuck that bitch

1956
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:05,040
I would never fucking collab with her. She obviously copies my content my content style

1957
02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:09,440
She copies my voice like she copies my art style

1958
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:13,280
She's trying to be me so hard

1959
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:17,200
She copies everything I do

1960
02:40:18,560 --> 02:40:23,200
I would never fucking touch Liberty with a my rats are fighting with a 10-foot ball

1961
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:27,200
Um

1962
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:34,320
And you thank you for coming back to us. I felt so empty while you were gone on vacation. Oh every day was dragging an endless

1963
02:40:35,440 --> 02:40:38,720
Please god holding over two weeks killed me. I want nothing more

1964
02:40:40,720 --> 02:40:43,200
I hope the full passes tonight. We'll see

1965
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:57,040
Okay, I think I'll stop reading mirrors for now because it's been a good amount of time. Um

1966
02:41:00,640 --> 02:41:02,640
Yeah, I'll stop reading for now

No, I'm not copying her

1970
02:41:18,640 --> 02:41:20,640
What a copycat exactly

1971
02:41:24,240 --> 02:41:27,760
Don't copy strike your channel. Don't copy strike your channel. Please don't copy strike your channel

1972
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:32,160
Don't don't don't don't don't don't don't uh, don't don't don't don't touch her channel

1973
02:41:32,160 --> 02:41:34,160
Please please leave that channel alone

1974
02:41:34,880 --> 02:41:42,400
That don't touch her channel. Thank you. I I appreciate that. Thank you. Don't touch her. Don't touch Liberty's channel

1975
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:46,160
Thanks for reading the mirrors. Thank you for sending them

1976
02:41:46,160 --> 02:41:49,040
I still I still a lot of the ones I read today

1977
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:55,360
I already read myself, but I wanted to read out loud so that like, you know that I read them, you know

1978
02:41:56,080 --> 02:41:58,080
Um

1979
02:41:58,400 --> 02:42:00,880
Amy is the fraud. No, I'm not the fraud

1980
02:42:02,240 --> 02:42:05,920
I'm not the fraud literally every day that I leave that channel up

1981
02:42:06,400 --> 02:42:11,440
This is how much I love you every single day. I leave that channel up. I'm fucking risking it because

1982
02:42:11,920 --> 02:42:17,200
Well, not the channel, but some of the videos on there should not have been left up by youtube

1983
02:42:18,560 --> 02:42:20,560
Some of them have like

1984
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:28,080
You're looking I'm just waiting for youtube to like strike those those videos down

1985
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:31,760
So you're welcome for leaving them up

1986
02:42:33,520 --> 02:42:35,520
Um, okay, let me see

1987
02:42:44,880 --> 02:42:48,080
Some of them are very blessed. Please don't strike them. Yeah, I'll leave them up

1988
02:42:48,160 --> 02:42:51,840
But I'm kind of risking the channel a little bit by leaving them up

1989
02:42:54,640 --> 02:42:58,080
I've had them remove remove they gave me a strike once

1990
02:42:58,640 --> 02:43:03,760
Because I did like really I did really uh, I did a lot of ear licking in one

1991
02:43:04,480 --> 02:43:06,800
Um, so I got one strike on that channel

1992
02:43:07,920 --> 02:43:12,160
And I'm planning to do it again on this channel with mimosa

1993
02:43:12,880 --> 02:43:14,880
Uh

1994
02:43:16,560 --> 02:43:23,040
We'll see what happens. I'll try not to I'll try to I'll see what I can do. I'll see what I can do

1995
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:28,400

To see who you want to raid because there's too many for me to choose myself and I want you to choose. Okay

02:43:48,080 --> 02:43:52,080

Uh, there's also Shabal Tanya. I I follow her. I don't know if she would be comfortable with me raiding her though

2004
02:44:11,360 --> 02:44:13,360
Um, and then silly

2005
02:44:19,440 --> 02:44:23,120

Holy crap. Thank you so much. I was I truly wasn't expecting to get this much

2009
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:42,640

This much like support on my return stream, so thank you

2011
02:44:49,280 --> 02:44:53,440
Because I was gone for so long. I'm sure some people like kind of forgot

2012
02:44:54,880 --> 02:44:56,720
um

2013
02:44:56,720 --> 02:44:58,720
Seems like most people are saying Azira

2014
02:44:59,120 --> 02:45:05,440
YouTube down bad for thinking you're licking is yabai kind of is yabai

2015
02:45:06,480 --> 02:45:09,680
Kind of is a little bit. Eh, I don't blame them

2016
02:45:11,360 --> 02:45:14,240
I wish they would let me post it. I'm not gonna lie

2017
02:45:20,960 --> 02:45:24,240
Live, uh, YouTube is only going after new stuff as far as we know

2018
02:45:25,840 --> 02:45:27,840
Hopefully

2019
02:45:27,840 --> 02:45:29,840
Hopefully

2020
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:38,560
Maybe youtube loves you. YouTube does not love me. Uh-uh

2021
02:45:48,480 --> 02:45:54,080
I can never forget my little sister. Oh, thank you. That's another reason why I have to post content

2022
02:45:54,320 --> 02:45:58,080
Because people will continuously

2023
02:45:59,440 --> 02:46:04,240
Leave they will leave and that's okay because I do the same thing

2024
02:46:06,960 --> 02:46:08,960
Up ten dollars

2025
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:12,720
Thank you for the ten dollars. I do the same thing with streamers low-key

2026
02:46:14,400 --> 02:46:18,720
I wish you wouldn't leave, but I do the same thing. Sometimes I'll just like pop in a stream

2027
02:46:18,880 --> 02:46:27,120
I'll thank you for the for the $50 super chat eternity. Sometimes I'll find a streamer and like watch them a lot and then leave

2028
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:34,080
Um, sorry if I ever did that to you. I'm sorry

2029
02:46:36,560 --> 02:46:39,200
You're stuck with us till death do us part. I hope so

2030
02:46:40,480 --> 02:46:43,600
You're stuck with me. I'm not stuck with you. You're stuck with me

2031
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:47,680
Okay, um

2032
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:52,000
Okay, it's really close between a zero and sheebie, but

2033
02:46:52,640 --> 02:46:57,520
Sheebie's the one who won by two percent right now. So I will uh

2034
02:46:58,320 --> 02:47:00,320
Choose sheebie for now

2035
02:47:02,080 --> 02:47:04,080
Oh, I forgot one more poll

2036
02:47:04,480 --> 02:47:06,480
um

2037
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
Oh wait, that's a Q and a what the fuck

2038
02:47:17,680 --> 02:47:19,680
Oh

2039
02:47:27,760 --> 02:47:29,760
Shit

2040
02:47:36,320 --> 02:47:38,320
Um, how do I

2041
02:47:41,520 --> 02:47:43,760
I don't know how to word this

2042
02:47:48,080 --> 02:47:50,080

Can I

2047
02:48:24,480 --> 02:48:28,880
Because I know a lot of you have been waiting for me

2048
02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:43,280
Um, if in doubt use code and dorm my craft terms. Oh

02:48:45,760 --> 02:48:50,800
Minecraft terms, I don't know. I don't know how to change it to minecraft

2050
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:58,880
You did get a little needy. I'm really surprised that the yes is so high. I really thought you were gonna say no

2051
02:49:02,640 --> 02:49:05,520
Begging got me not blaming you

2052
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:14,480
I try not to leave my main streamers but sometimes I don't have time so it's hard to catch up on vods

2053
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:22,160
That's fair. That's understandable. I won't I won't get mad at you if I see you leave for a long time then come back. It's okay

2054
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:27,680

02:50:42,320 --> 02:50:50,000
I didn't fill up the mold enough so it wasn't like a complete chill dough. It was like half a chill dough

2074
02:50:51,520 --> 02:50:53,360
So

2075
02:50:53,360 --> 02:50:55,840
I can't I won't use the chill dough yet

2076
02:50:58,320 --> 02:51:04,480
I'm on a missed tips four dollars and 20 cents. Isn't there another poll you needed to do before the end of this dream?

2077
02:51:04,960 --> 02:51:06,960
I mean I just did it

2078
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:11,360
I think that I think that uh

2079
02:51:12,880 --> 02:51:17,040
I think I think that that notification might have been a little late. Um

2080
02:51:18,960 --> 02:51:20,960
Well, I want to do it before the shower

2081
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:26,720
Else you might need two two showers. Oh, well, I do like uh

2082
02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:34,640
I do like a mini shower afterwards like I just kind of um

2083
02:51:35,920 --> 02:51:39,920
I do do a mini shower afterwards, but I'm not a full shower

2084
02:51:42,160 --> 02:51:45,680
But I want to take a shower now because I'm uncomfortable and sweaty and gross

2085
02:51:48,080 --> 02:51:50,080
Should ask Dempah for tips on the chill dough

2086
02:51:53,200 --> 02:51:54,160
No

2087
02:51:54,160 --> 02:51:58,160
Dempah posted an audio of the chill dough and people wanted me to do the same

2088
02:51:58,560 --> 02:52:03,760
But I already asked Dempah for permission to copy one of her ASMR ideas

2089
02:52:04,240 --> 02:52:09,520
And I feel like such an asshole if I copy another one, you know, I already asked her if I could copy one

2090
02:52:09,840 --> 02:52:12,000
I want to recreate her um

2091
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:16,000
Shocking myself with a shock collar ASMR video

2092
02:52:16,560 --> 02:52:20,160
I'm gonna recreate that one. So I'm not gonna I'm not gonna steal all her ideas

2093
02:52:20,240 --> 02:52:26,640
She's she's got a lot of really good ideas. You guys should go support Dempah here. Let me oops. Did I fail the redirect?

2094
02:52:28,320 --> 02:52:30,800
Maybe let me let me let me

2095
02:52:31,680 --> 02:52:33,680
I

2096
02:52:35,280 --> 02:52:38,640
Can help why am I so bad at youtube how does youtube work?

2097
02:52:45,280 --> 02:52:50,400
Let me send you to her channel too because she has a lot of good ideas and she's a really good uh

2098
02:52:50,800 --> 02:52:55,040
ASMR streamer too. I think it's mostly on twitch. I believe

2099
02:52:56,000 --> 02:53:00,640
So I'll send that too. I will be doing a collab with her soon

2100
02:53:02,240 --> 02:53:06,640
I will be doing an ASMR collab with her soon. So that's really exciting

2101
02:53:07,280 --> 02:53:10,960
Please look forward to that but the collab with mimosa is coming first

2102
02:53:12,400 --> 02:53:17,040
Okay, I keep yapping. Um, will you do it multiple times in the audio? Please say yes

2103
02:53:18,320 --> 02:53:20,320
multiple times

2104
02:53:20,560 --> 02:53:22,560
um multiple times

2105
02:53:23,280 --> 02:53:26,080
I'm already really tired from earlier today

2106
02:53:29,440 --> 02:53:32,240
How many is multiple how many do you want?

2107
02:53:35,520 --> 02:53:41,920
Says be in lex that's actually really funny you say that because me and mimosa actually do kiss in our audio

2108
02:53:44,160 --> 02:53:51,440
Don't worry. We're not we're not uh, we're uh, we kiss you too. We kiss you too. We're not just kissing in front of you

2109
02:53:52,800 --> 02:53:54,800
That would be funny

2110
02:53:55,920 --> 02:53:57,920
Let it grow rest

2111
02:53:58,640 --> 02:54:00,640
As many as you can give us

2112
02:54:01,920 --> 02:54:03,920
As many times as you can at three hours

2113
02:54:04,640 --> 02:54:08,960
At least six what the fuck is wrong with you the problem is um

2114
02:54:10,560 --> 02:54:17,600
Twitter limits how much unless you have like twitter unless you pay for the twitter subscription twitter limits the

2115
02:54:18,160 --> 02:54:20,000
amount of

2116
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,720
Like the longevity of the video you post

2117
02:54:23,360 --> 02:54:26,480
I think it can only be around two minutes long

2118
02:54:27,120 --> 02:54:28,880
I think

2119
02:54:28,880 --> 02:54:30,880
so

2120
02:54:31,200 --> 02:54:32,480
Hold on

2121
02:54:32,480 --> 02:54:34,480
twitter audio

2122
02:54:35,280 --> 02:54:36,320
um

2123
02:54:36,320 --> 02:54:37,760
length

2124
02:54:37,760 --> 02:54:42,400
Or sorry video length. Yeah two minutes and 20 seconds is the max you can post to twitter

2125
02:54:43,440 --> 02:54:47,200
So I can only really unless you want me to cut it

2126
02:54:48,080 --> 02:54:51,920
For every single time I can only really go as many times

2127
02:54:52,800 --> 02:54:56,240
As I can in two minutes and 20 seconds

2128
02:54:57,120 --> 02:54:59,840
And I'm not fucking paying for x premium

2129
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:04,640
Twitter streaming is a thing. I don't want to do that

2130
02:55:08,720 --> 02:55:14,320
So um, no mimosa won't steal you won't steal me from you. Don't worry

2131
02:55:14,880 --> 02:55:16,880
Um

2132
02:55:20,640 --> 02:55:26,480
I saw people posting two hour long movies on there they might have x premium cut it for every single time

2133
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:29,760
You're trying to kill me man

2134
02:55:30,880 --> 02:55:32,880
I think I can

2135
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
I think I can go twice in two minutes

2136
02:55:37,520 --> 02:55:41,360
I think I can make it to twice in in in two minutes can't post multiple

2137
02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:46,960
I mean you want so much out of me. I think I could go twice

2138
02:55:50,560 --> 02:55:52,560
I'll try my best

2139
02:55:53,360 --> 02:55:56,000
Go file then tweet the link. Ah, but that's

2140
02:55:57,040 --> 02:56:04,320
Twitter doesn't like links like twitter suppresses every single post I make with the link like I don't want I want people to see it, you know

2141
02:56:07,040 --> 02:56:09,040
You know

2142
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:16,080
Hmm you want so much from me. You're so needy

2143
02:56:19,280 --> 02:56:24,240
I missed you can send a cat box link. I don't even I don't even know how to use cat box. I don't

2144
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:30,480
I I think I think I I'll I'll just I I don't

2145
02:56:31,440 --> 02:56:34,800
I think I'll just go as many times as I can in two minutes

2146
02:56:35,760 --> 02:56:38,800
It sounds like I'm cheaping you out, but like um

2147
02:56:41,520 --> 02:56:44,160
I don't even I don't last two minutes. I don't

2148
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:47,520
I don't last two minutes

2149
02:56:50,320 --> 02:56:55,360
So I'll just okay. I'm done. I can't um

2150
02:56:56,960 --> 02:57:06,080
Can we get a mantra? Yeah, sure. I'll try to remember to say that too. Um, okay

2151
02:57:06,880 --> 02:57:13,760
But the gifted memberships notification keeps going off

2152
02:57:16,240 --> 02:57:23,920

Uh to every single person that sends me a marshmallow and is like embarrassed and they're like, oh

2161
02:58:10,720 --> 02:58:17,040
I'm so sorry if I made you uncomfortable by role playing that I want to have sex with you. It's fine. You're fine

2162
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:19,200
It's okay

2163
02:58:19,200 --> 02:58:21,200
You didn't make me uncomfortable

2164
02:58:21,360 --> 02:58:23,920
If I was uncomfortable, I wouldn't be here, you know

2165
02:58:25,120 --> 02:58:30,800
Uh, thank you for 60k on the collab with kai foo. Holy fucking shit. I didn't expect that to get so popular

2166
02:58:31,520 --> 02:58:33,520
I really I really was like

2167
02:58:34,400 --> 02:58:36,400
Doubting it because I was like, uh

2168
02:58:37,200 --> 02:58:39,440
Cat girl ASMR such an overdone thing

2169
02:58:40,560 --> 02:58:42,560
But kai foo's a cat so I was like

2170
02:58:43,280 --> 02:58:46,640
Well, I guess we should do cat stuff and then most is a fox

2171
02:58:46,880 --> 02:58:49,200
So I was like, let's do fox stuff

2172
02:58:50,560 --> 02:58:55,680
Every vtuber I collab with I'm like, oh, you're an animal. Okay. I guess I'll become that animal with you

2173
02:58:57,360 --> 02:59:00,880
I guess I'll become that animal. I'm doing fox stuff with mimosa

2174
02:59:01,520 --> 02:59:06,080
Uh, actually no denpa's an alien. I'm not doing alien stuff with denpa

2175
02:59:07,920 --> 02:59:09,920
Okay, anyways

2176
02:59:10,160 --> 02:59:12,160

02:59:26,320 --> 02:59:29,280
Sunday's gonna be a long longer day. Um

2181
02:59:30,880 --> 02:59:32,880
You're both voted so it's to be expected

2182
02:59:34,160 --> 02:59:36,160
That's good. Um

2183
02:59:37,600 --> 02:59:40,240
