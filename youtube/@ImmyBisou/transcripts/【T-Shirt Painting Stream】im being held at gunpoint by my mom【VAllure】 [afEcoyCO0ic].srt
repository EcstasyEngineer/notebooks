Hey,

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:38,300
Uh.

8
00:04:38,300 --> 00:05:07,660
Oh, wait, wait, where's my- I lost my phone for chat, um, oh, let me try to find it,

9
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:18,540
I just had it with me, oh, it was underneath me, hi, hello, I can see you now, I can see

10
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:32,780
you now, hi, I'm sorry for being late, I know we're like 15 minutes late now, sorry, I um,

11
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:54,140
I um, I still haven't bounced back, exactly, not yet, um, it wouldn't be an Emmy stream

12
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,660
without you being a little late, as no- are none of the other girls ever late, I feel

13
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,620
I feel like they are sometimes, right, I mean maybe I'm the latest, I don't know,

14
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,340
it's okay, we can wait if it means getting the live, yeah, sorry, I accidentally started,

15
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:24,060
I accidentally started the live and then um, ended, like right away, I started it and then ended it,

16
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:32,780
and that's what happened and that's why I had to restart it, like an idiot, so that, yeah,

17
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:42,860
we were just early, and we say something cringe for you, cringe, I don't know what cringe stuff

18
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:51,580
to say, it's gotta come naturally, you know, yeah, you need like 15 minutes for people to pile in

19
00:06:51,580 --> 00:07:01,100
anyways, people, people, you know, people will pile in and they take time, let me um, switch over to

20
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:23,420
um, oh, hi, that doesn't look quite right, let me scooch this down, okay, now I'm wearing gloves

21
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:31,980
today, um, I got an ad on my own stream so I can't see what's happening, I can't, um, give me gloves,

22
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:45,500
yeah, um, I forgot what I was going to say to be honest, um, well today we're painting this

23
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,740
shirt for my mom, gloves to protect from pants, no, gloves because I'm feeling self-conscious,

24
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:58,540
I don't know why, I feel like, I feel like I have so many lights around me and yet the

25
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:07,020
stream still looks really dark, like, here let me move this mouse, maybe I shouldn't put that there,

26
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:16,460
where do I put chat, I'll put chat right there, do you like my phone case, I got a new phone case,

27
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:25,260
isn't it cute, and I got a little mushroom charm, it's got, it's a little mushroom with a

28
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:37,900
strawberry uh, strawberry purse, very cute, um, what was I saying, I feel like it's the, the camera

29
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:45,580
looks so dark and I don't know why, because I'm surrounded by lights, like I have this huge light

30
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:56,140
right next to me, and then I also have like a big ring light right here where I'm pointing at the

31
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:04,300
camera, so I don't know, I don't know, it's very in season, yeah, because it's um, what is it,

32
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,140
but it's gonna be September soon, in like 10 days I think,

33
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:16,780
I have to look up for chat, oh no nevermind my chat came back,

34
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:28,300
release the fingers, no, the gloves aren't pretty silky though, I like them, they look dirty,

35
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:34,140
but it's just my skin tone like peeking through, because like I got them a little wet from the

36
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:45,180
drink, we're drinking um, loho of last in this really rubbed off, off really, really rubbed off

37
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:59,100
hello kitty cup, with the straw barely able to get to the top of the cup, um, okay right, so my mom

38
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:07,660
asked me to paint her a shirt, because my cousin painted her dad a shirt, and my mom was like,

39
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,300
oh Amy you've painted shirts before, why don't you paint, why don't you ever paint me a shirt,

40
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:21,660
so now I'll have to paint a shirt for her, um, you buy your gear subs using the 10% off code, Amy,

41
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:32,620
that's funny, um, yes you should do that though, if you buy it you should do it, you should use

42
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:40,300
my cup, no that's weird to say, um, I have painted one shirt before when I was in high school, let

43
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:46,300
me, I don't know if I can still find it, it's in my closet which is literally right there, um,

44
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:53,340
I'll try looking for it, give me a second,

45
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:55,980
okay, I just tore apart my whole closet to find this shirt, um,

46
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:07,500
this is what I painted, this is my, it's traced, okay I didn't, I didn't come up with this myself,

47
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:13,260
it's traced from the internet, but this is what I painted on my first ever, um, shirt,

48
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:24,620
it's really cute right, I'm pretty proud of it, I mean I didn't draw it myself, but I feel

49
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,820
like the, the quality is there, it has some holes in it from my rats, but the quality is there,

50
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:39,020
like it, it looks good, you know, it came out really really good, yeah, I can't guarantee that

51
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:45,260
this one will come out good, because I'm not gonna put as much effort, this took me like two days

52
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:52,140
to make, okay, I'm not gonna put, we're not putting that much effort today, impressive self-portrait,

53
00:12:52,140 --> 00:13:02,140
it's not me, it's not me, you can really feel the emotion, I'm gonna throw that away, okay, I'm,

54
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:13,100
I'm gonna look on like Pinterest, my idea, my idea is my mom likes cats,

55
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,340
that's the same design on your mom, oh doing the same design on your mom's, no she doesn't want that,

56
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,420
um, my mom likes cats a lot,

57
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:33,180
but when we went out on vacation, she went to this really shitty store and she found like

58
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:39,420
kids shirts with like a, like a kid's shirt with like sparkles and a cat on it, and she was like,

59
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:46,940
look at me isn't this so cute, and I was like, I guess so for like a first grader, and she was like,

60
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:52,380
well it's cute, oh I forgot to put on my headphones, thank you for the ten dollars,

61
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:58,060
okay let me put on my headphones, oh there's my, ah, okay hold on,

62
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,060
where the fuck are my headphones,

63
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,060
huh,

64
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,660
oh there they are,

65
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:39,100
I hope this is steady, ah, I'm really, my biggest fear is like this coming out, and showing my ugly mug,

66
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,820
um, where,

67
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,100
what am I looking for right now, oh I know,

68
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,500
there we go,

69
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:13,580
no, she's gonna hate an Ahegao shirt, we wouldn't tell, good, good,

70
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,820
there's no way little sis can be ugly, oh,

71
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,460
keep living in that fantasy land,

72
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,260
no I don't think I'll draw a tin pal, I'm really not trying to expose myself here,

73
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,980
um, what I think I'll do

74
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:50,300
is um, I'm gonna go on Pinterest right now, and I'm gonna, um,

75
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,660
go on,

76
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,940
I'm gonna look for a cute picture of a cat, I'm thinking of drawing like those um,

77
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,020
what's it called, you know those like pocket cats that like stick their tongue out,

78
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,300
I'm thinking of drawing something like that, except not their tongue sorry, stick their middle

79
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:20,700
finger out, I think I'll draw something like that, um, except I won't put the middle finger,

80
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:29,500
I don't know, she's kind of like, she's kind of, she's not really that cool, if that makes sense,

81
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,660
I don't know, I feel like she's not cool enough to like the cat with the middle finger,

82
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:40,060
like she wants something like kind of, what does it mean to say ugly, she wants something kind of,

83
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,900
kind of like something you would find in like, oh my god,

84
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,980
okay there we go, um,

85
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,460
she wants something you would find in like a children's clothing store,

86
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:05,820
you know, um, cute cat, um,

87
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:17,900
what's like that word that you use, grumpy cat, no, I don't think she wants grumpy cat, um,

88
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,820
let me see what I can find, these are like,

89
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:42,380
should I draw her this, do you think she'd like that,

90
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,220
I don't know, I, she's not internet enough to know, I gotta draw something like,

91
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,100
that looks more obviously like a cat,

92
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:08,220
oh, man, but these internet cats look so cute, like this one, look how cute this one is,

93
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:17,100
man, if fully she was a little bit more like, on the internet, she would understand,

94
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:23,820
but instead she would be like, um, is this a cat, is this supposed to be a cat,

95
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:33,580
oh wow, thanks Amy, I love it, you know what I mean, I can't give her that,

96
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,660
um, maybe a black cat,

97
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,460
I could draw like the cat from,

98
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,220
um,

99
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:59,420
something like this, something cute like that, right, at least your mom loves you, damn, okay,

100
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:09,900
no matter how much to that, Kiki's, yeah, like Kiki's like a little circle with the kitty like that,

101
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:15,100
that would be really cute, right, I think I'll do that, I'll do it like right here, like on the,

102
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,580
on the boob area, like right, or maybe on,

103
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,420
hold on, if you put, like on the heart area, I don't know, one side of it,

104
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,420
yeah, plain and simple, something cute and simple and plain and cute,

105
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:42,460
oops, hold on, I gotta put the glove back on, it doesn't work on the, like I can't use my phone

106
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:50,860
if I'm wearing it, oh I should go back to, oh wait, no, how do I save this, how do I download image,

107
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,180
also I forgot to show you, I got this commission of me as a cat, wait,

108
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,500
I got this commission of me as a cat, do you like it,

109
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:08,700
it's really cute, right, tell me it's cute, I think it's cute,

110
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:18,140
how do I like pin this to my screen, I forget, oh, Samsung's work,

111
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,660
I think if I like swipe, like swipe, there's like a side swipe you can do,

112
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,380
I thought there was a side swipe,

113
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:42,540
can someone help me, I would give her so many treats, can you make it a sticker, like sell it,

114
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,980
I don't think I'm allowed to sell it, it was just an average commission,

115
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:53,580
unless you mean like an email on YouTube, I'm trying to, I'm trying to pin this, like,

116
00:20:53,900 --> 00:21:02,860
this is in my gallery, I'm trying to pin it to my screen so I can still look at YouTube,

117
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,220
how do I do that, I'm kind of a noob,

118
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:23,740
at least you got a mom, I'm adopted and my adopted parents put me up for adoption,

119
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,340
okay now you're trolling, now you're trolling, come on now,

120
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,780
if you open your open app screen, tap and hold the, on your,

121
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:43,980
what, oh, oh thank you, I got it, I got it, thank you, thank you so much, I got it,

122
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:53,260
okay let me put that in the corner, now I can still see it, yeah there we go,

123
00:21:53,980 --> 00:22:02,700
my parents dropped me in the woods, I was raised by a pack of wolves, okay,

124
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:12,940
I don't know what to tell you man, are you trying to make me seem privileged here,

125
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,620
by not having not been raised by a pack of wolves,

126
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,060
send me to the wolves and I'll come back pregnant,

127
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,300
why do you look like you're ready for Halloween, what do you mean, are you talking about my blanket,

128
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,340
is that what you're talking about,

129
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:53,180
well, I just, that's just like, that's just like my style of decoration in my house,

130
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:01,740
I'm always, the house always looks like it's ready for Halloween, that's just how I decorate,

131
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,940
like all of my, not all of my blankets but like a lot of my blankets and stuff,

132
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:18,700
have that vibe, I guess I do kind of look like a scarecrow, huh, yeah I'm gonna do it on this up here,

133
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,460
on this shirt pocket,

134
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,220
I don't know, I have to like position this carefully, maybe like,

135
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,180
I feel like I'm gonna end up drawing it somewhere really awkward,

136
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,420
okay, I'm gonna try to draw it like,

137
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:59,900
right right here, kind of, I hope I get it right, I have um, I have these,

138
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:07,580
I have these, these are uh fabric markers, so I'm gonna sketch with the fabric marker

139
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:15,980
and then I will um, I don't have anything to like hold this down, and then I will paint

140
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:25,660
with paint, with uh, fabric paint, yeah, I got fabric paint, I really enjoy the background music,

141
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,500
I forgot I even had background music,

142
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:38,700
oh, I do have background music, no pins to hold it, no I don't have pins to hold it, no,

143
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,020
man I'm gonna have to draw a good circle too, maybe I should trace a circle,

144
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:54,220
I have this, I have this, should I try tracing a circle with this or, or maybe my cup,

145
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,420
hold on, oh that's kind of small,

146
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,260
that's even smaller,

147
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,700
should I try tracing a circle with this, this is kind of dangerous,

148
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,500
I'll try,

149
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:30,300
okay well that's like, oh you can't even see it, that's like, generally a circle,

150
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:38,860
it's like the, the general shape of a circle, kind, kind of, right,

151
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,700
damn it, why did my chat disappear, why does it always do this, oh well I guess I won't,

152
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:54,540
maybe, hold on, I'm using my nose right now, oh god damn it,

153
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,500
okay,

154
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:10,060
how do I turn my phone on, do not disturb, do not disturb, don't disturb me right now, I'm busy,

155
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,220
I hope you didn't see that text from my cousin that appeared on my screen,

156
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,820
that would be um, that would be breaking your illusion a lot,

157
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,980
is it still, is that still paint thinner, no that's just water,

158
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:40,780
okay, must be nice to be produced by two other organisms, I was a failed lab experiment,

159
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,780
that was a bandit, I really don't call this a darkness, your students health, thanks for everything,

160
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,940
you're so funny, we couldn't see it, okay good, good, good, good,

161
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:59,980
there we go, I know I'm always worried that like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna accidentally show like,

162
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,780
I don't know, something crazy like my internet history or my address by using my phone on stream,

163
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:19,420
okay, um, so I know you can't see it very well, but I, I dotted um, a circle

164
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:26,860
with my cup, so yeah, and now I have to paint it, wait, um, I got this very fancy,

165
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:34,220
I literally got this today, I got a very fancy paint brush holder, show the history, no, no,

166
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:39,580
no I can't, I can't, I can't, I got this very fancy paint brush holder for all my paint brushes,

167
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:47,260
oh wait, I should actually sketch out the cat too, shouldn't I, frick, oh shit,

168
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:55,340
man, uh, okay, I see myself in your phone, oh,

169
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:05,180
what do you mean, oh you mean you see chat, oh yeah, yeah, I have, I have, I do in fact have chat

170
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:12,780
open on my phone, okay, I'll try to sketch out the cat, so many brushes, I am an artist,

171
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,100
I've kind of collected these over a lot of years and they're all really cheap,

172
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:24,220
they're not like fancy brushes or anything, um, yeah, it's chat, what kind of paintings do you do,

173
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,420
um, okay, I don't actually really, I don't actually really paint much, um,

174
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,180
I don't really paint much like,

175
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:41,980
this is more oval, isn't it, I don't really paint much like paint things with actual paint,

176
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:47,180
I really should, I think I should more, um, do more of that, but um,

177
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,100
I feel like I have the wrong color here, okay, this is the color I need, this one's not dark enough,

178
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,980
but um, I used to do a lot of like watercolor stuff,

179
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:07,820
yeah, I used to do a lot of watercolors, so a lot of my brushes are like watercolor brushes,

180
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:16,220
like this shape, um, because that's what I use them for, yeah,

181
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:24,860
so Bijuu is a master artist, oh, Bob Bijuu is a master artist,

182
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:32,220
I mean, if you want to think about it like that, sure, I'm Bob Bijuu, oh yeah, I didn't,

183
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:38,460
I don't have like an artist, should I get like an artist, um, should I get like a, like a, like,

184
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:45,580
what's it called, some like the hat, a beret, should I get a beret and place it on top of myself,

185
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:55,500
that's kind of a lot of work, and I'm kind of lazy, I'm just dotting this on, it looks like it tickles,

186
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:08,460
what, what tickles, the marker, I kind of made it too big, I made her face kind of big, maybe that's

187
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:24,940
good though, there's no erasing in this, so we just kind of have to do our best,

188
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:33,020
oh the paintbrush, it doesn't really tickle, I should do some more, I should do, I should

189
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:43,100
do some peep brush ASMR, I feel like it would sound good, obviously this is my streaming, um,

190
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:54,620
microphone, so it probably doesn't sound like ASMR, our minimal effort emotol, I put a lot of effort,

191
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:03,420
just not into every single thing I do, sometimes I need like, sometimes we need low effort days,

192
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:17,820
okay, you could trace with a pencil then use the marker, nah, that's too much work, I mean I know

193
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:26,060
what I'm doing is a lot of work, but that's like extra work, you know, and like, we're just trying

194
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:33,740
to, we're just trying to get it done, we're not, we're not trying to, you know, do anything crazy

195
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:43,820
now, I feel like I should, I should, I need to hold it like this, maybe I should,

196
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:50,620
struggling here, I kind of made it, made it, made her a little long, I guess she is kind of long,

197
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:57,340
your mom is going to wear this around, you need to make sure she looks good,

198
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:09,340
nah, I mean she'll wear it no matter what it looks like, I uh, I made a shirt for her when

199
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:15,260
I was in like seventh grade with, with literally like these exact kind of markers, it was such an

200
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:24,860
ugly shirt, but she wore it for a really long time until it faded, and um, she wore it because I

201
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,740
made it which is cute, but every time I saw it as I got older I was like mom why do you still wear

202
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:40,140
that shirt, it's so ugly, okay and then a little nose, there we go, I don't know, she's a little bit

203
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:53,340
widened, I tried, wholesome, it is wholesome, it is cute, it's kind of, I don't know, she's,

204
00:32:53,340 --> 00:33:04,780
she's an interesting, she's a strange person, yeah moms do love that kind of stuff, okay um,

205
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:17,420
I need paint now, oh I don't have my um, okay hold on, I need to get my, my um, what's it called,

206
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:25,420
what's it called, palette, paint palette, yeah I need to get that,

207
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:23,260
the rats are kind of active right now, I kind of want to, I kind of want to get them out, but

208
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:29,980
there's so much stuff that they could ruin, like I had to get all new fabric paints because they

209
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:40,140
literally ate my old fabric paints, I think I kind of want to let them out, I'll just, I'll just give

210
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:48,460
you a rat tour where I'll just show you the rat and then put it back in the cage, rat tour

211
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:13,260
check, this is Luna,

212
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,140
she doesn't really, none of my rats like being held because they're not really from

213
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:24,940
breeders, they're just like random rats that I find, but that's Luna,

214
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:31,500
if you get a rat from a reputable breeder, they should be really friendly, but if you just get

215
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:40,220
a random rat like I do, they might not be as friendly, but this is Luna

216
00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:11,260
and here's Pixie, yay, she also, oh Pixie, she also doesn't like being held,

217
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:20,220
but at least she'll let me, come back, okay Pixie just

218
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:39,740
okay, well Pixie's out, it's okay, and I can't show you Dennis because Dennis bites and she

219
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:55,260
hates me, oh shit my phone turned off, okay, Pixie was the one who bit your feetsies,

220
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:01,660
I don't know, was she, she's right over here, you can't see her, but maybe she'll come,

221
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:08,380
hi Pixie, no she doesn't want to, um here's my shitty palette, it's covered in paint because

222
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:20,940
I'm a lazy artist, she's a menace, Dennis is a menace, she's camera shy and she's a menace, yeah

223
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:30,060
and Pixie's trying to steal my toilet, not my toilet paper, but my paper towel, come here,

224
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,740
come back in your face, come back in your face,

225
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:46,780
very professional, I know, I got it from uh Dolorama, which is the Canadian dollar store,

226
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:54,380
except they, it's like the Canadian Five Below basically, okay let's start with white,

227
00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:02,620
let's start with white, like rat like owner, both camera shy and menaces, but in a good way,

228
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:09,740
if I was a rat I'd probably bite too to be honest, I'd probably bite too, oh I got a super chat,

229
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:17,500
why didn't I see that, sweet cats cartoon logo would look cool to paint, oh swat cats, not sweet

230
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:24,460
cats, what is swat cats, I've never heard of that, are you gonna make me look up swat

231
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:33,020
cats with my nose right now, I bet you'd bite, yeah I would bite, yeah I would bite,

232
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:41,180
it's a 90s cartoon, my mom didn't watch cartoons, and she's also not born in the 90s,

233
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:49,180
but my mom didn't watch cartoons mostly because she uh, they didn't have, did you see her?

234
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:55,180
She's scared,

235
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:07,980
aww, please don't steal that, she didn't have cartoons um

236
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:17,660
on tv when she was younger, so cute, I'm gonna attack her and put her back in her cage,

237
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:25,180
come here, where are you going?

238
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:39,180
okay, she's back in the cage, she didn't actually have cartoons on tv as a kid,

239
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,460
um, not to say that she's that old, it's just like,

240
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,500
you monster,

241
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:59,580
baby rat prints on shirt, nah, she doesn't really like rats, how am I supposed to open this?

242
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:11,020
oh, making a huge fucking mess,

243
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:17,740
there, no paint goes to waste in this house, I hope that's enough,

244
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:34,380
oh my god, let the rats free, no they're gonna eat the paint, I want this open,

245
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:40,220
bruh, what am I supposed to do here, this is cardboard on the inside,

246
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:47,100
uh, they have nothing to poke through,

247
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:57,100
yeah, one already ate a marker, they're gonna eat the paint, I don't want them to eat my paint,

248
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:04,060
don't take their freedom away, I already took their freedom away, what the frick, okay, hold on,

249
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:11,900
I can't use the paintbrush to poke it out, because the paintbrush isn't, um,

250
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:17,900
oh I almost had it, okay, I got it out, the paintbrush isn't thin enough to poke it out,

251
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:32,620
pinky won't poke, pinky, how tiny do you think my pinky is, this is the hole,

252
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:38,060
you can't even see the hole, this is the hole, my pinky will not fit through that hole,

253
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,620
man, I already got paint on me, damn it,

254
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:53,740
you want me to take your freedom away, your freedom was gone the second you started watching me,

255
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:01,100
I ate your soul the second you watched me, the second you tuned into my stream and decided wow,

256
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:06,060
I kind of like imibisu, that's when I took your soul and it's mine now, this is too small,

257
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:14,700
let's use a bigger one, let's use a bigger one, should I try this one,

258
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:23,020
yeah there was a ritual and everything, you're right, we did do a ritual, both of us did a ritual,

259
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:32,460
actually speaking of ritual, I got a, Shibi's doing um, Shibi's doing a, what's it called,

260
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:42,460
Shibi's doing a spell, a spell, uh, I think she's making spell jars, she's doing a spell jar

261
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:50,140
making stream, before me, I had to do a spell jar stream, I literally bought all the stuff I need

262
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:57,580
for spell jars and I never made them because I asked, um, I asked Manesan if I, if I could like

263
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:07,580
send out the, the spell jars that I make to you guys and I never got a response, so I was like,

264
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:15,100
I'm not sure if I should do one where like, you customize it to what you like, because

265
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:23,340
you know, I would want to send it out, I would, I don't care, I would cover the shipping costs, but

266
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,700
I don't know if that's like dangerous to do, you know,

267
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,500
maybe I'll just do a spell jar making stream without sending it out to people,

268
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:50,700
it would be nice if I could, I trust this with my address, you shouldn't, I'm kidding, um,

269
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,100
no, she didn't take my thing, Shibi's into witchcraft too,

270
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:05,340
when I first met her, I was like, Shibi, are you into witchcraft?

271
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:13,260
Because I, I could see from her, um, old, old clips that she did that kind of stuff and she was

272
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:22,860
like, yeah, are you? And I was like, yeah, it was nice. And Mercy is a little bit too, I think

273
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:31,660
she's not as into it as the rest of us, I'm not sure, did Mercy do a, did Mercy do a, a tarot,

274
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:38,860
the stream? I don't remember, I'd say don't send anything that would breed FOMO,

275
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:48,380
um, maybe you're right, I wouldn't be able to send it to every single viewer when I wouldn't be able to,

276
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,820
I don't know, I thought it like a watery system would be fun,

277
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,860
so that way everyone has a fair chance, but maybe you're right.

278
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:06,140
Should I do a little foot reveal? Which foot looks better, hold on, this foot looks better,

279
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:21,900
even closer. So if we cheat, we walk in with no genus tomorrow? What do you mean cheat? Like on me?

280
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,580
You're, you're walking with no genus and no tongue either.

281
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,700
And maybe even no fingers.

282
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:43,500
The toes, the toes! Also by the way, I know some people get sad when I don't read their,

283
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:50,460
their chat messages, I do read everything, like I read it in my head, I just, like I,

284
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,300
I see every chat message and I do read it in my head, I don't like it completely ignore,

285
00:45:55,100 --> 00:46:00,220
you know, chat, I do try to pay attention to chat as much as possible, I just can't respond to every

286
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:04,700
message, you know, so don't ever feel like, oh, she didn't see my message, no bitch, I see everything.

287
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,580
Well, I may not see stuff that mods delete, but like other than that, I see everything.

288
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:18,940
She doesn't hate us? Why would I hate you? What are you talking about? Yeah, I see everything.

289
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:27,420
Read this, I read it. She ignores, let's be honest, I don't ignore chat! Bro,

290
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,940
I appreciate chat so much, okay?

291
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,180
Fuck, I'm getting a foot cramp, fuck, fuck, fuck!

292
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:50,380
Oh my god, hold on, fuck, ah! Oh fuck, ah!

293
00:46:50,460 --> 00:47:00,540
Okay, as I was saying, um,

294
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:12,940
I appreciate chat so much because I spent the longest time being like a, an average of

295
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:19,900
fucking five viewers streamer, okay? I spent the longest time averaging like five viewers,

296
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:27,900
so um, my chat was pretty dead back then, if you can imagine, so having people actually talk to me,

297
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:35,180
I appreciate it a lot, it's, it makes, thank you for becoming a member.

298
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:43,100
Yeah, a whole five viewers, my top average actually not, okay, not to flex on you right now,

299
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:46,860
okay, I don't want to make you feel jealous if you're another streamer, but my highest average

300
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:54,140
viewers was nine, yep, yep, I was so proud of that too, I was like auditioning to Vtuber companies,

301
00:47:54,140 --> 00:48:03,580
and I was like, I have an average of nine viewers. I was like using that as like my um,

302
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:10,140
my experience for streaming, I was like, I've streamed for eight months straight consistently,

303
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:18,140
and I have an average of nine viewers. She was a one viewer, she was one viewer away from 10,

304
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:23,260
I know, I was so sad, I didn't want to round it up because I knew they could easily look up my average,

305
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:31,660
and if I lied, then they wouldn't take me, you know. Sign her up now! Where was phase connect?

306
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:35,900
They should have been up in my DMs trying to get me, I was so famous.

307
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:45,580
I mean, I hear it's hard to break five, it's hard to break any amount, especially on Twitch,

308
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:52,380
it's hard to get any amount on Twitch, in general, in general, it's hard to get any amount,

309
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:58,940
I need more paint, phase connect, yeah, they should have taken me, like, I was, I was, I was

310
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:07,020
right before the pickin'. They missed out. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm joking, I'm joking,

311
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:15,100
that's a joke. Thank you, that's a joke. Imagine nine people just wanting to watch what you're

312
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:21,500
doing in real life, yeah, and like, two of them were absolutely not my friends that I knew in real

313
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:30,220
life. Two of them were not people I knew in real life, so yeah, imagine nine people wanting to

314
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:37,180
watch you, that's like, you know, that's pretty, that's, that's, that's a lot, it is a lot, so yeah.

315
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:48,060
I had an average of four and was happy about any one more, I was happy too, like, I remember

316
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:57,660
one of, like, the best, this is kind of cringe, but one of my, like, earlier happy memories during

317
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:04,540
streaming was, this is so cringe, I got, okay, I would never get rated as the streamer mostly

318
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:12,860
because I had shit stream quality, so um, one time a streamer rated me with 13 viewers,

319
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:19,820
I know, one time a streamer rated me with 13 viewers, right, and I got so nervous, and um,

320
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:26,940
during that stream, this was when I was, like, more starting out, during that stream,

321
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:32,780
I had an average of seven viewers, and I was, like, hyped, I was, like, looking at the view count,

322
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:38,060
and I was like, holy shit, seven of them have been staying here, seven of them have stayed here with

323
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:45,900
me this whole time, and I just thought I was, like, really hyped, because seven of them stayed.

324
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:54,860
How many viewers did you hit that stream? Um, I don't know, maybe, maybe I had a max of, like,

325
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:00,860
because when people raid, you know, everyone leaves raid away, basically, so it's not, like,

326
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:09,660
that crazy, um, people left for sure, but maybe, maybe during that stream, I had, like, a height of,

327
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:17,500
like, 16, which for me back then was, like, crazy, crazy, but like I said, my stream quality was,

328
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:28,940
like, shit, it was so bad, it was so shit, like, so shit, um, but now it's a little bit better,

329
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:37,980
a little bit. Say it's better. It's better now, right? This is good stream quality, right?

330
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:44,300
Tell me it's good. I know that my camera is very cluttered, but I'm a very cluttered person in my

331
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:51,020
life, so this is normal for me. I know this whole area is very cluttered, it doesn't look nice,

332
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:57,100
but that's normal for me, okay? Why can you,

333
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:05,180
do a dinosaur? No, it's too late, I'm already doing a cat.

334
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:13,660
Oftentimes being a raid coming from a four to eight hour stream, wait,

335
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,700
I didn't see what, what, you've changed for the better?

336
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:27,980
Am I missing something? What are you talking about? Hold on, let me scroll up with my nose.

337
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:36,380
It's good? Good. Good quality, good. My camera might die a couple times because this, I'm using a

338
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:44,700
fancy camera, which was, like, $600, um, but it overheats, it overheats while I'm streaming,

339
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:50,860
so it, like, dies randomly. I was rated by a friend with 45 and I cried for a bit,

340
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:56,140
was fun, but also traumatizing experience. Do you have an Xbox mic? I did not use an Xbox

341
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:04,780
mic, no. I used, um, I used, like, a wee wee shaped one from Amazon, it was, like, really

342
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:11,020
phallic shaped, I was really bad. I'd lose my mind if I had seven viewers, my average is, like,

343
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:19,020
1.1, bro. At that point, that's just a skill issue, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, um,

344
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:25,740
cock mic. Sorry, I'm trying, I gotta, I gotta stop saying, like,

345
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,660
peepee and stuff on stream because, like, every single one of my streams get, um,

346
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:37,900
limited ads on YouTube. You can't just do him like that, bro, please don't make this

347
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:44,060
camera's not $600, please, it was. Sorry, is it that ugly? I think it looks good.

348
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:55,020
It was $600. My, my darling pin pals have helped me get it. Listen, I'm gonna go over, okay,

349
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:58,780
I'm gonna go on a rant about streaming. I'm gonna go on a rant about streaming, uh-oh.

350
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:07,580
Uh-oh, tiny little, fuck, uh-oh, little VTuber thinks she knows how to stream, I don't, but I think,

351
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:11,660
um,

352
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:23,260
I think a lot of people, um, can I please, a lot of people try out, oh,

353
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:29,660
can I have, like, one single, um, fucking hell.

354
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:38,780
Can I have one single train of thought without it being interrupted by myself?

355
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:47,180
Um, I think a lot of people start off streaming and, um, don't really know

356
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:58,140
much about how to stream and then they get discouraged when their average view count is low,

357
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:02,460
you know? Now, obviously, if you're just doing for, doing it for fun and you don't really care,

358
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:07,260
that's fine too. Honestly, I'm not gonna lie, don't tell Strani, don't tell Strani I said this,

359
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,460
but I've considered literally making, like, a Minecraft channel where I have, like, nothing,

360
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:18,540
like, not even a VTuber model and I just stream Minecraft, no one. I've been considering doing

361
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:23,660
that. I'm not gonna tell, I'm not gonna tell any of you. One day you'll, you'll come across a stream

362
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:27,580
on Twitch and there'll be a shitty Minecraft stream and there's gonna be no Facecam, no

363
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:32,620
nothing, no, no PNGTuber, nothing and it's just gonna be me streaming Minecraft and no one.

364
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:39,420
And you're gonna be like, her voice sounds familiar but I just, I can't quite pinpoint who this could

365
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:48,780
be. But anyways, um, I've completely forgot what I was gonna say to be honest. Yeah,

366
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:53,420
if you're doing it for fun, who cares, is fine, but I think some people get a little bit, oops,

367
00:55:53,420 --> 00:56:01,500
no sorry, oh, ill my hair. Oh my god, is this red hair or is it pink hair? I went, I had, I used

368
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,940
to have pink hair for a long time but this might be red hair from the wig I used to make hair,

369
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:17,900
hair petting ASMR. Um, where was I going on this rant? Where was I going in general? That's too small.

370
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:28,140
That's too small. Um, honestly I don't quite remember what I was saying.

371
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:38,540
I don't quite remember what I was saying. Something about streaming. Um, that was a little hard.

372
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,140
Okay, there we go.

373
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:48,700
I don't think I have ADHD. I don't think I do. I probably have something though for sure,

374
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:54,380
but I don't think it's ADHD. Something's wrong. I remember when I was having issues, I was having,

375
00:56:55,580 --> 00:57:00,300
let's not get too deep into it, I was having mental health issues in seventh grade is when it

376
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:07,900
started in seventh grade, specifically at my best friend's sleepover. Um, and I stayed up like all

377
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:14,380
night that night because I was freaking the fuck out and they, my mother refused to bring me home

378
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:21,020
because she was sleeping and the, the, my friend's parents refused to bring me home too because they

379
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:25,660
were sleeping and I was just freaking out all night and my friend was like tired and I was like,

380
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,860
please stay up with me, please stay up with me. I can't, I can't be up alone and she was like,

381
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:37,020
I mean, I'm fucking going to sleep on tired. But um, I went to the doctor, right? And the doctor was

382
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:44,380
like, does your family have a history of um, mental health issues at all? And my mom was like,

383
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:51,500
no. She was like, no, I don't think so. No, no, no, not that I remember, right?

384
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:59,260
Bitch, I don't know why she's thought no because when I went to visit my family,

385
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:05,420
and you know how parents drop like dad lore and mom lore, you know how parents like randomly drop

386
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:10,700
lore? She did that to me when we were visiting our family and she was like, did you know that

387
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:18,780
actually when I was a kid, my mom has three, uh, two siblings. Oh, shit, camera. How long was that

388
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,780
going? Sorry, sorry, sorry.

389
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:39,820
Oh, fuck. I fucked it up again. Hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on. I, uh, sorry.

390
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:47,660
Um, video capture device. Turn that off. Okay. Let me try this again. Sorry.

391
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:56,060
Can I go back? I actually, I don't know how to use this camera.

392
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,620
Amy got a stand. What do you mean a stand?

393
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:10,380
What? What do you mean the world though? Only a minute of true? Like two minutes?

394
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,780
Damn it, since the start of the rant, fucking hell.

395
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:22,940
Um, live streaming. Okay.

396
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,340
Okay, there we go.

397
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:40,860
Oh, shit. No.

398
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:55,820
There we go. Oh, and I'm getting it. I'm getting it. Hold on.

399
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,700
Okay. Okay.

400
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:13,820
I literally just told you this camera, um, this camera freezes from overheating.

401
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:19,820
Um.

402
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:41,580
Sorry, I'm eating my mic. Okay, I think this should be good.

403
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:54,300
We're back. We're back. Anyways, as I was saying,

404
01:00:54,300 --> 01:01:05,900
what model camera is it? A Sony ZV-1F. That one. I mean, you can see my legs.

405
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:17,420
Let me pull this in more towards me. Oh, fuck. I got pain on the shirt somewhere.

406
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:23,820
I can really forget what I was talking about. Right. I was visiting, um, my family with her.

407
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:31,020
Well, her family. I'm not that close to them, um, but we were visiting her family slash my family.

408
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:37,020
Um, and she was like, did you know that when I was a kid, she dropped some mom more. She was like,

409
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:45,100
when I was a kid, right? My, um, my mom, uh, so your grandma actually like had a little bit of a

410
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:51,180
mental breakdown and she had to go to the mental hospital for like a month and my dad had to take

411
01:01:51,260 --> 01:02:01,260
care of us. Your grandpa had to take care of us all alone. And I was like, what? What? And you never

412
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:07,020
told me this? And she was like, yeah, yeah. And then she just talked more about like her dad taking

413
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:20,540
care of her and her siblings. And, um, what was I even talking about? And, um, I met my uncle

414
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:24,860
and my cousins and I was talking to my cousins and my cousin was like, yeah,

415
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:32,380
our dad like has serious anxiety issues. Like he has really bad anxiety. He doesn't really admit

416
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:38,060
it that much. Sometimes he does, but he has, he's really, um, he's really anxious about everything.

417
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:47,260
And I was like, wow, I must run in the family, huh? I guess, I guess our family does have a history.

418
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:58,620
No history of mental illness at all. Amy's scatterbrained. Yeah, I'm always scatterbrained.

419
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:05,340
Your grandma was joker? No, my grandma was in joker. No. I don't know. How do I,

420
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:10,300
I gotta, hold on. Let me, um,

421
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:20,700
settings. Hold on. I'm changing it so my phone doesn't turn off after like five minutes with my nose.

422
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,780
Uh, display.

423
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:30,700
There it is. Screen time out. Wait, I can't, I can't make it never.

424
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:38,860
Wow. Oh, thank you for the five gifted. Yogi, thank you. I can't make it never.

425
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:44,780
That's so mine.

426
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:54,860
Hold on. Let me mute that. Oh, it is muted already. Never mind.

427
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:02,380
Yay, thank you for the gifted. That's so kind of you. Thank you.

428
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:07,420
I found that some parents are against mentioning mental health issues in the family. It definitely

429
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:13,500
doesn't help when you're trying to get help. It really doesn't. It really doesn't. Yeah.

430
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:20,620
Yeah. Sorry, I didn't have text to speech on. Um, I think,

431
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,180
I think I could turn it on now though.

432
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:38,140
Okay, now text to speech should be on.

433
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:40,380
Okay.

434
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:49,260
Came back from the making the Emmy card to be greeted by a gifted Emmy card. What Emmy card? A

435
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:56,220
card for me? You could turn off screen sleep for when it's charging, but you have to go into

436
01:04:56,220 --> 01:05:02,460
developer settings. Uh, I ain't no developer. I don't know how to do that. I'll just keep using my nose.

437
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,820
Okay, now we can do black.

438
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:14,780
I think it's a partly culture thing. I think it's our family. I was talking to my cousin and I was

439
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:21,020
like, is this a cultural thing? And she was like, no, no, no, most other parents I've met are not

440
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:29,500
like our family. I think it's an, it's an our family thing. Did I open this? I did not.

441
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:34,060
Both my parents were doctors and there's a really strong history of mental illness on

442
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:38,780
both sides of the family, but still it still took till I was in my twenties before I got diagnosed

443
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:47,580
with anxiety. Yeah. Yeah. I think some parents are a little bit in denial about it. And my mom is

444
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:56,780
really, really anxious too. My mom's got other issues too. Um, but she's like mega in denial. Like

445
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:03,980
she will not. Okay, sorry. I'm just hearing a really loud motorcycle. She will not

446
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:11,820
admit to anything at all. She will not admit to anything. And I'll tell her like, mom, I think

447
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:17,980
you have some, I think you might have some issues and she'll be like, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. I don't

448
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:20,620
know what you're talking about. No, me. No, no, no, no.

449
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:32,700
Send to you a tweet with some ways to help with the overheating. Oh, thank you.

450
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:40,060
I'll try checking in, checking it out later. I don't know why it does that. I can't open this.

451
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:48,380
I can open it. I just need to take off the glove. That's all.

452
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:57,980
She's in denial. Denial is a river in Egypt. Your husband is gay.

453
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:06,780
It's probably a generation thing. Older people generally don't like acknowledging mental illness

454
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:13,580
at all as they consider it somewhat, something shameful. That's true too. That's true too.

455
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:17,420
But I think my mom genuinely doesn't think anything's wrong with her.

456
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:26,220
Like my uncle, my cousin said my uncle does admit to a little bit of something wrong with him.

457
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:31,980
Like he has a little bit of issues, but my mom straight up just doesn't admit to anything.

458
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:40,780
Where did I put this? Oh, there. And then I have to open this one.

459
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:56,540
Every time I see, um, oh, I thought it was positive. Every time I see you rating my burps in chat,

460
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:59,100
I'm always surprised because I always forget that I burped.

461
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:09,660
Let me, um, try opening this now.

462
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:21,820
I just like, I just, I like just ignoring my issues. I do the same thing.

463
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:28,540
Okay, I'm going to, come on. Open, please. Please.

464
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:42,940
Come on. I'm trying not to splatter it everywhere. Come on.

465
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:48,540
Okay. Ah!

466
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:54,060
I hope that'll work.

467
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:59,100
Oh, I'm fucking stupid. Damn it.

468
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:12,380
Am I late on chat? Question is, no, I'm not late on chat. Oh, you bitch. You dumb whore. Oh, man.

469
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:16,460
Now these gloves are going to be like that forever.

470
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:27,420
I want to help you so bad. Oh, please come help me. I'm so helpless and weak. Please, please.

471
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,380
Can anyone count their issues on one hand?

472
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:39,980
I think I could. I might, I might use up the whole hand, but I think I could.

473
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:43,500
Okay. There.

474
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:53,020
Mmm. That's too big. Didn't I have another brush around here?

475
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:00,860
Oh, here's another one. Well, that's too small.

476
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:09,820
Maybe I can use this one. Sorry if you hear noise. It's my, my headphone wire hitting the mic.

477
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:18,460
Um, I was so zoned in on watching all that happening with the paint. That what?

478
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:24,860
Okay, that's really fucking annoying. Please be normal for like two seconds.

479
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:29,260
Can I not have a scuff scream for, scream for two seconds?

480
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:36,860
I was going to rant about something else too, but I forgot what it was. Oh yeah, the streamer thing.

481
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:40,460
Okay, I actually am a little bit passionate about this. Um,

482
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:47,180
one time I actually had a friend that got rated because this friend was like really,

483
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:53,420
really popular. Not popular. This friend had a lot of other friends and so their friends were

484
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:57,900
like popular and sometimes would rate them and they would get rated with like 300 viewers and

485
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:03,980
I'd be like, damn, that's crazy. Imagine getting rated with 300 viewers. I would freak out.

486
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,580
I love your scuff.

487
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:19,340
I think, I think streamers in general are kind of just, um, destined to be scuffed, you know.

488
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:27,260
Technology is hard and also, um, things go wrong a lot.

489
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:35,340
Listen, don't say the amount of viewers. Stop it. I'm trying not to look at that.

490
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:42,060
Ever since I left Twitch, I can't turn off the viewer count. I don't know how. I'm trying not to

491
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:48,700
look at it. Um, oh yeah, right. Okay, so I was talking about the streamer thing. So I think a

492
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:57,020
lot of people get discouraged when their, uh, when their view count is low. If they're, if they're

493
01:11:57,020 --> 01:12:01,500
trying to take streaming like seriously, you know, if they're trying to take stream seriously, then

494
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:08,620
they might get discouraged because it's like, oh, you know, I'm, I'm streaming, but I have so little

495
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:16,620
viewers. What's going on? What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. You suck. Skill issue.

496
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:24,860
Quit. Die. Give up. Turn the stream off and leave forever. Um, that's not true.

497
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:30,300
Okay, there could be a lot of things wrong, but some, some really big issues that I notice

498
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:36,300
is because I'm a small streamer connoisseur. I actually only watch small streamers. I don't

499
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:43,980
watch big streamers. Name any big VTuber. I don't watch them. Um, name any small VTuber. I also

500
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:48,460
don't watch them because there's a lot of small VTubers and I don't watch that many VTubers in

501
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:57,660
general. Um, but don't listen to these, don't listen to these other people in me. I'm your only

502
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:02,940
viewer. I'm only streaming to one person right now and that's my big brother. Um,

503
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:09,260
but a really big problem I've noticed, especially, I'm gonna kill myself. It blended in with the

504
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:16,300
white in Minecraft, especially amongst the ones that are like, you know, kind of disappointed

505
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:23,580
that they don't have that many viewers is that they don't talk like they'll play the game and then

506
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:33,660
they won't talk. And, um, I've had people tell me like, oh, the only reason you're getting, um,

507
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:39,180
more viewers is because you're a girl. And this is when I had like average of like nine viewers,

508
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:46,300
you know, they'd be like, because you're a girl and it's like, listen, I am, I was pretty cute back

509
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:53,180
then, back then. Um, but I put a lot of effort into my streams. Even though they were scuffed,

510
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:58,140
I still put a lot of effort into them. I put whatever effort I could and also I fucking talked.

511
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:05,020
I was a yapper. I did, I did gaming week where I streamed for like every day playing video games

512
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:12,220
every day. Um, I really burned myself out of streaming, but I non stopped yapped during those

513
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:17,340
gaming streams. I was a yapper and that's the only reason I even had a little bit of viewers,

514
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:22,300
despite my stream being so scuffed is because I kept yapping and I was actually pretty funny.

515
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:28,140
And I was, I was a cute girl. I'm not going to lie. I was cute, but I wasn't cute enough to the point

516
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:36,460
where like, I wasn't cute enough to the, what? Why does she look like that? She looks normal to me.

517
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:41,260
I don't know. I wasn't cute enough to the point where my, um, cuteness could like, you know how

518
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:44,940
there's like booby streamers, like titty streamers and like a lot of people are like, oh, they only

519
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:50,220
have viewers because their titties are out, you know? Um, can you feel the gap on the ear?

520
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:55,420
Which gap? Which gap?

521
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:05,180
Playing games? Who are you and what have you done with Amy? I normally didn't play games. That's

522
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:10,860
why I had gaming week. That's, that's why I had gaming week where, where I would play games.

523
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:19,580
Because I normally did not play any games. Um, but that was my gaming week where I would play

524
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:27,420
games. God damn, this is really annoying. Okay, hopefully that'll stop it.

525
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:34,940
And maybe where the black has hit the white and made it gray. Yeah, I'll fix that, don't worry.

526
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:39,340
I'll fix any shitty mistakes. Okay, well, I'll try, I'll try to fix any shitty mistakes.

527
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:47,900
I'll try, okay? But like, I, I, uh, I only have so much energy I can put towards this,

528
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:58,700
this kind of shitty drawing of a cat. Um, I also did not show my titties on stream either.

529
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:04,540
Um, so I feel like the fact that it was, that sometimes I would be told like, oh, you're a girl,

530
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:08,300
so that's why you get straight, that's why you give yours. I wasn't showing my boobies,

531
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:15,020
like ever. That was the, the, when I showed my boobies here was the first time I've ever

532
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:24,380
showed my boobies on stream. So like, you know, I wasn't, um, I was not getting viewers because

533
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:30,220
I was a girl. I was just getting viewers because I was yapping and I was trying to be entertaining.

534
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:40,060
If you weren't, then that makes you a better streamer. No, no, I'm not gonna shit on booby

535
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,940
streamers. Oh fuck it, paused again. Okay.

536
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:55,260
Why does it do that? Should I switch cameras? Should I switch cameras?

537
01:16:55,260 --> 01:17:13,980
Rade? Oh, harem raid. Hi. We are not experiencing technical difficulties right now.

538
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:16,940
There we go.

539
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:29,820
Hi, harem. Hi, sheeby. What was sheeby doing? I don't even remember. Hello.

540
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:43,820
Do you use the camera with the screen out? No. I don't know. The, the screen out? No,

541
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:48,460
I'm not looking like, I don't have the screen, the screen flipped open or anything. I'm not looking

542
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:55,420
at it. Sucker for love. Oh, I heard of that. Is it a dating simulator? I heard it was a dating

543
01:17:55,420 --> 01:18:04,460
simulator. I think it's a dating simulator. I feel those streamers aren't the best and

544
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:11,180
not as much entertaining other than the things, other than the other things making them entertaining.

545
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:15,500
I don't know. How you sound, how you sounded.

546
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:25,420
Man, I'm having a seizure. Not a seizure. I'm having a strong, um,

547
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:35,020
um, well obviously some of them, some booby streamers just kind of like,

548
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:43,020
you know, um, the point of the streamers, they're boobies, but some streamers just have their

549
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:47,500
boobies out and sometimes they may have their boobies out, but they could also be entertaining

550
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:52,060
with their boobies out. You know, having your boobies out doesn't make you not entertaining,

551
01:18:52,780 --> 01:19:03,020
you know? Or you try to, or you try to seduce goat goddess mommy girl. Oh, goat goddess.

552
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:15,180
Oh, goat goddess. Like, Azura? Um, this is kind of bad. Should I make like a white outline?

553
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:18,940
Not a white outline, a black outline.

554
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:26,300
I think I need to make the eyes bigger.

555
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:37,820
It was Azura's eldritch twin.

556
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:48,060
Um, so yeah, my biggest advice is to yap and then my second biggest advice

557
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:56,460
is to post other content. Don't just stream. Don't just stream. Maybe back in the day when

558
01:19:56,540 --> 01:20:03,100
streaming was still kind of new, you could just only stream and maybe get popular,

559
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:08,220
but nowadays there's so many streamers that you have to post other content to,

560
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:16,060
you know, make your chances bigger. Like, I've seen streamers not post other content that much

561
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:23,580
and still get pretty big, but um, I, I don't, I don't hit lotteries like that.

562
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:32,380
We don't, we don't, not around here partner, not around here. We don't, we don't get lucky

563
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:38,540
like that. We got to post other content, you know? And it doesn't have to be like, I don't know.

564
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:45,260
It doesn't have to be like full length YouTube videos. It can just be clips as long as they're

565
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:51,980
entertaining. Some people get labeled as city streamer. They aren't even sexual. They just

566
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:56,540
happen to have boobs. Yeah. Some people, like, I don't know, girls can be comfortable and have

567
01:20:56,540 --> 01:21:00,380
their boobies out and that's okay. They don't have to be a city streamer just because they have

568
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:09,420
the boobies out, you know? Trying to make the eyes bigger. That's better.

569
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:19,180
There we go. And the nose. And then I need to make the whiskers, but I think I'm going to go

570
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:27,500
one more time around, um, yeah, I'm going to go around the circle one more time just to make it

571
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:34,060
like, um, it's not positive. Just to make it, um, I'm getting a knee cramp now.

572
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:44,380
Just to make it a little more opaque. Hold on. I got to stretch out my knees.

573
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:53,660
I got bad knees. I don't know why I got bad knees, but I got bad knees.

574
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,540
Ah.

575
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:04,860
Okay. Oh, I gotta do this, like, too, I think.

576
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:18,940
Yeah, that's my rant about streamers. I'm still salty to this day because, uh,

577
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:23,820
someone said I only get viewers because I'm a girl, even though I had, like, nine viewers.

578
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:34,460
And I would be like, dude, just talk, just talk, just, just yap a little bit. I know playing the

579
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:40,700
game is fun. I know you have fun playing the game. If I hear one more fucking bump, I'm going to kill

580
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:47,900
my soul in Minecraft. I'm going to jump off the Minecraft. I'm trying to think of a way to end

581
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:52,060
my life in Minecraft. I'm going to jump in lava.

582
01:22:55,020 --> 01:23:00,620
Okay, I hope that works. Can you see the wire? No, I think I'm covering it, which is good.

583
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:08,620
Nine viewers is a luxury to some people it is. To me, it was. I was really proud of it.

584
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:15,580
I was super proud of myself back then for nine because those nine people were there for me.

585
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:21,020
And now you're here for me too, which makes me very happy.

586
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:26,700
Um, and I'm not as nervous anymore too when there's a lot of people watching, you know.

587
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:37,820
I'm not as nervous anymore. Like, when we're gonna debut, I was a little bit nervous.

588
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:43,180
Um, like right before debut, I was a little bit nervous. I was like, oh, it's starting to hit.

589
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:47,100
It's starting to hit. I'm getting a little nervous because I knew there was going to be

590
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:54,940
quite a few people because, you know, you know, we did the Sponsored Watch Alongs.

591
01:23:55,660 --> 01:24:03,740
And, you know, we got a read from DTL. So I knew there was going to be like quite a few people,

592
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:09,420
but I wasn't sure how many. And there was quite a few people still. And I was a little nervous,

593
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:15,660
but once I actually like got into the groove of things, I was pretty okay. I wasn't like shaking.

594
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:20,220
I wasn't shaking. I wasn't, I was sweaty because it was hot outside, but like,

595
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:26,860
other than that, I was mostly okay, which I'm proud of myself. I've gone, I've come, I've come so far.

596
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:30,700
Wow, wow. Thank you for becoming a member. I've come so far.

597
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:37,660
We're proud of you for no longer being nervous. Oh, thank you.

598
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:44,460
Yes, it is also good to have a group of fellow streamers. I was instantly hooked.

599
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,140
I almost ate the paint water.

600
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:10,860
Okay, we're almost done.

601
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:19,100
I got groomed. It wasn't my choice at all. It is your choice when you get groomed.

602
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,940
It's all your fault for getting groomed.

603
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:24,860
All your fault.

604
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:37,340
That was all I had to say about the streamer thing.

605
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,740
Some people also think that streaming long hours makes you more popular,

606
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:49,020
which is a bad idea because I thought the same thing, not more popular, but that you would grow

607
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:54,460
an audience better. I thought the same thing. I was like, I should stream longer because then I have,

608
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:59,340
you know, more chance of getting more viewers. So I streamed for like four hours.

609
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:04,860
I streamed for like four hours. Oh, fuck it. Pause.

610
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:32,140
Okay. Oh my God. I'm just scaring the shit out of me.

611
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:39,820
Hi, Emmy. Love your ASMR first time being able to catch a stream. Thanks for being awesome.

612
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:42,380
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

613
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:47,580
Double Emmy. Yeah, sorry. I have to switch. I have to like refresh the...

614
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:55,820
Please, please, please, please. How do I do this?

615
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:02,460
Now you can see the wire though. Sorry.

616
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,180
When life's pause button works.

617
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:15,660
It's, it's, I don't know how to use cameras. I got one, I got one because I knew I was going

618
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:21,500
to do a lot of hand cam streams. So I wanted to get a good camera, but now I'm struggling

619
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:26,060
because I don't know how to use cameras. So my camera's overheating.

620
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:28,940
Anyways, that's the white part.

621
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:37,820
I look your Twitter first when I was checking viewer before your debut. Then I found your teasing

622
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:43,500
audio. By God, I couldn't escape. My teasing audio? What's teasing audio?

623
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:50,620
My teasing audio? Man, I don't even know my own audios.

624
01:27:53,500 --> 01:28:00,540
Wait, you stream? I think I do. Sometimes. Yeah, I did it for like four hours back then,

625
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:07,980
and I was always so tired afterwards and I was like, fuck man, four hours, four hour shift.

626
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:21,260
Four hour shift talking to nobody. Talking to myself. Jildo? What? Oh, I did,

627
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:27,180
I did do some teasing. I think I, I put out like a couple of audios on Twitter before that. Yeah.

628
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:42,940
I need to listen to the ASMR at some point. You should, but I really don't have that much out.

629
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:51,260
It puts again? What the fuck? Okay, I think I need to switch cameras. I'm sorry. Now it's getting

630
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:56,540
really bad. Okay, I'm going to switch cameras. I'm going to switch to one that doesn't overheat.

631
01:28:56,540 --> 01:29:03,100
It is lower quality, but what can you do? Okay, hold on. Give me a second. Here,

632
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:10,060
I'll put on the BRB screen so you don't have to deal with me struggling. Hold on.

633
01:30:56,540 --> 01:31:10,060
Okay.

634
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:40,060
Okay.

635
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:08,060
Okay.

636
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:18,060
Okay, hold on.

637
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:30,940
Oh, damn it.

638
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:39,500
Now, I've been noticing any comments saying,

639
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:43,740
Amy, is this a different camera? I don't notice the difference. Yes, it is. It is a different

640
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:52,060
camera and you better notice the difference. But yeah, this is a different camera. I swear

641
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:56,780
to God, if people are like, oh, is this a different camera? Please, please, please, please.

642
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:02,860
I do see the difference. Thank you. This one's obviously lower quality, right?

643
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:08,940
Very different. Okay. It looks the same. Stop. Stop.

644
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:15,740
The t-shirt looks smoother because this is a lower quality camera.

645
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:18,940
That's why the t-shirt looks smoother.

646
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:31,180
The quality is being, you know, it's smoothing it out, you know? It's blurrier. Yeah. Yeah.

647
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:42,380
Right? I don't know. It's good enough for now. Is this a different shirt? No, no.

648
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:49,900
Couldn't tell it was a cat until now. Stop. Now you're just, now you're just

649
01:33:50,700 --> 01:34:01,180
jor-jorking my peanuts now. Now you're just jor-jorking my peanuts. You're pulling on it.

650
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:06,940
Can you hear me good? Okay, good. Is this a different emotional? It's the same one.

651
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:14,940
It's the same one. Can you see all the wrinkles now? What wrinkles? Oh, shit.

652
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:23,820
What wrinkles are you talking about?

653
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:33,260
It is the cat from Kiki's delivery service. I think that's what it's supposed to be, at least.

654
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:44,380
It's a little bit gloopy. The paint's a little bit gloopy.

655
01:34:49,980 --> 01:35:00,220
It's Gigi, the male cat. Uh-oh, male on stream. Oh, no. Oh, no.

656
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:04,540
It's okay. It's just a kitty.

657
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:17,500
We have X-ray vision. Does that mean you can see through my gloves?

658
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:20,700
Does that mean you can see through my pants?

659
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:24,060
There we go.

660
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:35,420
There we go. It's so cute. Okay, I'm gonna clean the edges of the cat too now.

661
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,380
We can see all the hair.

662
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:43,500
I'm not covering it because I didn't shave or anything.

663
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:46,300
That's not why.

664
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:53,340
Oops, I had more.

665
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:08,460
Sorry, I gotta stretch my back out. Oh my god. Can you stretch my back out for me?

666
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:17,100
Uh, it hurts. I hate aging. I know, I'm sorry. I'm acting like I'm 40 years old.

667
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:19,420
I'm sorry to any real 40-year-olds out there.

668
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:21,180
Hi, glove.

669
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:29,980
I don't, every time, when I was a kid, I would always kind of tease my mom for being old because

670
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:35,500
she actually used to lie to me about her age. She would always tell me she's younger than she is.

671
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:43,900
And I started teasing her for her age because she would, you know, lie about it to me.

672
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:48,780
And now it's like, fuck, man, I don't like being teased for my age.

673
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:53,660
Don't tell me I'm a hag. It offends me.

674
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:59,180
Yeah, it means only 38.

675
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:02,300
Stop. I'm not 38.

676
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:10,940
My mom was 36 for about five years. That's what I'm saying. My mom would do the same thing.

677
01:37:10,940 --> 01:37:15,020
It was her birthday recently and I was like, mom, how old are you turning? And she was like,

678
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:20,140
you don't know. And I guessed. And then I guess I guessed an, um,

679
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:27,020
I guessed an age too low, like by one year and she got all offended. She was like,

680
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:34,860
no, do I really look that age? And it's like, mom, you've been sun tanning for like 10 years of

681
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:44,380
your life. You unfortunately do look that age. Unfortunately, mom, you do look that age because

682
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:50,380
you've been sun tanning so much. And now she understands that sun tanning is bad for her skin.

683
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:56,940
When she was younger. Oh my God. I had to wait, I had to wait hours at the sun tanning salon

684
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:03,740
because she loved sun tanning. I remember one time I went on a school trip and I guess it was summer

685
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:09,980
and, um, it was for like a week. And then when I finally got back, she came to pick me up

686
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:15,180
from school and I didn't even recognize her because she was so orange. It was like a jumpscare

687
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:23,740
when I saw her face. I was like, whoa, whoa, what happened to you? And she's like, I was just

688
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:32,860
tanning a little bit in the backyard. She was so orange. She was so orange. And now my cousin

689
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:39,260
does the same thing except my cousin. My cousin knows that the sun is bad for you. So instead of,

690
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:45,260
like the Lorax, bro, she was, she was orange than the Lorax. She was so orange.

691
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:53,900
Except my cousin knows the dangers of the sun. So she uses fake tan. But I feel like low-key,

692
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:59,820
like fake tan makes you even more orange than regular tanning. And so anytime I see my cousin,

693
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:07,100
I'm always like, girl, you are so orange. It's giving oompa oompa. But I don't tell her that

694
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:13,340
because she's really self-conscious about being pale. I don't know why. I don't know why people

695
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:20,300
are self-conscious about being pale. I think, I really don't think, like, I feel like people's

696
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:30,220
natural skin tone complement them the most, if that makes sense. Like, I feel like that

697
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:35,340
complements you the most. And I feel like when you change it, it just looks weird. It looks off.

698
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:42,700
And hers does complement her. Like, she's, she's really pretty. Like, she's very like,

699
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:46,780
bro, I'm the fucking ugliest duck in the family. Both of my cousins are like model-esque.

700
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:52,380
And she's really tall too. But like, she's like, every time we take a photo together, she's like,

701
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:57,660
oh my god, I look like a dead corpse. And it's like, girl, you just, you're just pale. It's okay.

702
01:39:57,660 --> 01:40:02,540
It's okay to be pale. It's okay. It's not, it's not that big of a deal. You look fine.

703
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:10,460
She's just a girl. True. True. True. She, she's just a girl. That's hashtag just

704
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:16,060
girly things. Girls are kind of insecure about silly things, aren't they?

705
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:24,860
My skin is less pale and more like see-through. See, that's what she says too. She's like,

706
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:30,220
oh my god, look at me. You can see my fangs. I look like a zombie. And it's like,

707
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:37,740
that's normal for pale skin. But you can see my veins too. And that's because I have varicose veins.

708
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:44,300
Sorry, girl. Like, the rest of the family, we're gonna, we're all gonna have very

709
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:45,980
visible veins at some point.

710
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:55,660
And yeah, zombies are green. Okay, zombies are green. They're greener or like blue or like,

711
01:40:55,740 --> 01:41:05,660
um, I don't know, like brown, like zombies are like dead colored. Gray even, like, you know.

712
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:12,060
Is varicose, fancy talk? We're super cute. No, I think, I think varicose is like, um,

713
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:18,780
oh man, like back. Slouching like a shrimp. Varicose means, um,

714
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:26,620
uh, I don't even know if that's the right term. Is that the right term? It's like, um,

715
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:35,820
it's like we can, when you can see the veins really, really clearly, um, despite, I don't know,

716
01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:43,420
it's like a, it's like a, um, it's like a condition, I think. It's like a condition.

717
01:41:43,420 --> 01:41:47,740
My grandma has it really bad because she's old. Yeah, it's when they pop out a bit.

718
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:51,180
My grandma has it really bad. You can see like all the veins on her leg. My mom,

719
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:57,980
my mom also has it. It's not as bad as my grandma, but it's, it's very apparent. Um,

720
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:05,740
and I am developing it as well. Oh, fuck. She got some snot on her.

721
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:15,900
My mom has spider veins, spider veins? No, varicose veins. I hate when they pop out.

722
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:20,060
They don't really pop out. Uh, not for me at least. They don't pop out. They just, um,

723
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:30,780
they're just very, very obvious. Like, um, they're very visible. Um, they don't necessarily pop out

724
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:35,020
for me or my grandma or anything. I think my grandma may be a little bit because she's like

725
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:40,220
old, old, but like, for me, they don't pop out and for my mom, they don't pop out. They're just visible.

726
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:48,780
So the cat's a girl now? I don't know. Is it? Why would it be a girl suddenly? What do you mean?

727
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:57,340
I thought that's a small mouth. No, that's the nose. This is the little nose.

728
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:04,460
Oh, did I call, did I call the cat a she? It's a cat. Cats don't care about pronouns. It's a cat.

729
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:06,460
It's a cat.

730
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:15,100
You think crow's feet is ugly? I don't know what crow's feet is. What is crow's feet?

731
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:23,980
Oh, you said she had snot yet. It's a cat. Varicose veins are a bit of a deal later in life,

732
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:30,140
since it's easier to bruise and stuff, I think. Probably, uh, that makes sense for sure. Um,

733
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:35,660
but for now, it's not a, not a big deal for me.

734
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:46,620
Oh, my mom has spider veins. May not be the same thing. I don't know what spider veins is either.

735
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:50,060
Oh, crow's feet are eye wrinkles. Oh, I don't care.

736
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:55,820
I have really, really bad wrinkles under my eyes. I've had them since I was a kid, like

737
01:43:56,780 --> 01:44:01,740
they're just naturally there, whether I smile or do anything. I just have like, um,

738
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:10,620
like, I don't know how to describe it, like, like folds under my eyes kind of,

739
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:16,780
but like multiple, I have like two under each eye, maybe even three. I think it's just two, actually.

740
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:20,780
Um, I've had it since I was like a kid.

741
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:29,820
Yeah, it just means you smile a lot. Yeah, there you go. Eyebags? I don't, I don't, I don't think

742
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:36,620
it's eyebags. It's like folds. I do have really bad eyebags too. I, I got really bad eyebags too,

743
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:44,300
but it's like folds, like skin folds. It's not, it's not eyebags. At least I don't think so.

744
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:46,300
Oh man, it's blending again.

745
01:44:51,180 --> 01:45:01,180
One on one side, two on the other. Yeah. Yeah, eye wrinkles are just a sign that someone smiles a lot. Yeah.

746
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:10,300
Can you pull a domain expansion? Do you stand on business? I don't even know what that means.

747
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:15,340
I've, I don't, I don't watch Jiu-Jitsu Kaisen. I don't know what that means.

748
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:22,620
I bet I could pull a domain expansion if I tried hard enough.

749
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:33,340
No, eyebags just crazy dark circles. I have dark circles too, yeah. Like someone said,

750
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:41,260
a natural, a natural eye shadow. I have to, I, whenever I like put makeup under my eyes to

751
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:47,180
cover my eyebags, I have to put it all around so that it doesn't look like I'm wearing eye shadow

752
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:55,820
because my, um, my eyebags go like on top of my eyelid too. Oh man, I'm getting in other places too.

753
01:45:59,740 --> 01:46:02,460
And I don't know if it's just a case of not sleeping enough,

754
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:06,940
because I did wake up really early for school every day.

755
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:15,580
Um, sorry, not for school. I woke up for daycare every day because my mom would have work at,

756
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:22,460
I don't know, I think maybe she started at like 7am or something like that,

757
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:27,100
or maybe like 6.30 or something. She would start really early every morning and, um,

758
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:30,700
so she would have to take me to daycare every morning and, um,

759
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:38,860
I would wake up at like 5am every day for like a lot of my childhood just to go to daycare,

760
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:44,460
which fucking sucked. I hated daycare. I hated daycare because I was the first one there and

761
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:52,620
the last one to leave, and I hated that. I had my eyebags for 12 years, I think they never went

762
01:46:52,620 --> 01:47:00,780
away. Yeah, sometimes they're just, um, like, like, uh, hyperpigmentation, like they're, uh, genetic.

763
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:06,860
Yeah, some people just naturally have them.

764
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:11,740
My IRL sister! I'm your IRL sister!

765
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:18,060
Uh, looks like she's running on two hours, even when she's fully rested. Yep, that's me.

766
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:24,940
Growing up, my house was the daycare? Wait, what does that mean? Does that mean your

767
01:47:24,940 --> 01:47:28,860
parents ran a daycare? I need to hide these dots here.

768
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:34,860
There's like dots down here, and I feel like I need to hide them.

769
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:48,460
Does the finish, does the finishing product of the cat have no pupils because it's blind?

770
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:53,820
No! I'm not done yet! It has no pupils because I'm not done yet!

771
01:47:55,580 --> 01:48:00,620
What do you mean? No pupils. There is pupils in the image.

772
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:08,220
I'm just trying to cover up these dots at the bottom, from the marker.

773
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:23,020
Some people have never seen Kiki's delivery service. That's okay. I don't know. Where, uh, I mean,

774
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:27,900
actually, no, that's weird. If you're, if you're like, VTubers in anime, if you, and you've never

775
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:34,620
watched, like, Ghibli movies, that's weird. But in general, that's normal for some people not

776
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:41,020
having seen Kiki's delivery service. Because, oh fuck.

777
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:52,700
A lot of people don't know about anime. I'm gonna kill him. I'm not gonna kill him. I'm not going to do it. Sorry.

778
01:48:53,180 --> 01:49:02,620
It's required viewing. I feel like just, like, a lot of, a lot of, uh, a lot of Studio Ghibli movies

779
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:06,860
are required viewing if you're an anime fan. Because it's like, it's like the classic, you know?

780
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:12,060
I don't like it when people are like, oh, you're an anime fan, but you've never seen blah, blah,

781
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:17,500
blah, blah. Like, I don't like that, but I feel like Studio Ghibli movies are like,

782
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:23,420
I don't know. They're movies for, like, everyone. So that's, that's fine, you know? But I don't like it

783
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:32,700
when people are like, oh, you like anime, but you've never watched. Bingo bongo's big adventure z.

784
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:37,820
You know? I don't like that. I think that's cringe. But yeah.

785
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:42,620
I mean, I need to not say anything. So my, uh,

786
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:50,060
I need to not say anything so my streams don't get demonetized. Also, Amy says KMS three times in

787
01:49:50,060 --> 01:50:00,860
one stream. I'm bad at controlling myself. You're bound to run into and watch a Ghibli

788
01:50:00,860 --> 01:50:05,900
movie at some point in your anime career. I watched Ghibli movies before I even knew what anime was.

789
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:09,820
Like, they were playing at the cinemas here and I would go with my mom and I would watch them.

790
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:19,260
And even at the library, I, we used to rent out movies from the library and from Blockbuster

791
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:25,820
too. Yup, yup. I was alive when Blockbuster, Blockbuster is not that old, but from Blockbuster

792
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:31,660
too, I would rent movies and sometimes I would just rent out like Ghibli movies and I didn't

793
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:36,860
know that they were anime. I just thought they were cartoons. Like it's pretty, it's, it's, it's

794
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:44,460
pretty widespread. You miss Blockbuster? I miss Blockbuster too. I miss Blockbuster. Now the only

795
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:53,180
place to rent movies is the library and like, I don't even know if, I don't, the library, like,

796
01:50:53,180 --> 01:50:58,940
I'm not gonna fucking get on a bus to go all the way to the library to rent a movie, you know?

797
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:06,460
Casual doxxed age? Not really. Not really.

798
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:18,940
Blockbuster's pretty new still. Like, it wasn't, I think it, it, maybe the last Blockbuster close

799
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:27,740
in like what, 2010 maybe? Or like 2015? I don't know. Maybe 2010. When someone, someone look up

800
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:34,060
on the last Blockbuster close. It was, it really wasn't that long ago. We sail pirate ships these

801
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:40,220
days. I know and it's nowhere near as comfy to sail a pirate ship. Okay, I'm gonna draw the eyes now,

802
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:49,740
like the pupils. Like it's, it's nowhere near as comfy to do that, if you ask me.

803
01:51:50,220 --> 01:51:57,660
Like, I don't know. I really need to, to get myself a DVD player because that's just so much

804
01:51:57,660 --> 01:52:04,220
comfier. I don't know why either. I really don't know. Like, something, maybe I do have GERD.

805
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:15,660
Something about like physically inserting a CD into a DVD player or a DVD. I don't fucking know.

806
01:52:15,660 --> 01:52:18,940
Okay, I don't know the, I don't know the difference. It doesn't matter. Something about physically

807
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:24,540
inserting a DVD into a DVD player just makes it like 10 times more comfy than like opening

808
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:32,060
Netflix and like putting on Shrek 3, you know? And I don't know what it is. I really don't.

809
01:52:34,220 --> 01:52:39,660
Um, but yeah. And so I really want to, I think I made the people too big.

810
01:52:40,460 --> 01:52:49,660
Oops. I really want to, um, I really want to get a DVD player. Physical media is the way to go. I know.

811
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:57,980
It's a comfort ritual. It is. It is. I think the whole experience of just going to Blockbuster

812
01:52:57,980 --> 01:53:03,740
and picking out what you wanted to watch was peak. It was peak. Now I kind of want to watch

813
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:10,620
Shrek the 3rd. But I wanted to record a Twitter audio after stream. I don't know. I'm so freaking.

814
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:20,540
I'm tired, grandpa. I'm tired, but like, my cousin said this and I really resonated with it. She was

815
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:32,140
like, I was born tired. I was born anxious and tired and I was like, oh, same girl. Same.

816
01:53:34,620 --> 01:53:39,820
Hey, you watching Shrek the 3rd? I'll watch any Shrek. I really like the Shrek movies.

817
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:43,660
The Shrek movies were comfort movies to me as a kid. I really like them.

818
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:48,460
Yeah.

819
01:53:53,420 --> 01:53:59,660
Because when I would visit my dad's house, there was like, oh, shit. One of the pupils is like

820
01:53:59,740 --> 01:54:04,060
longer than the other. There was like nothing to do at my dad's house because it's like,

821
01:54:04,060 --> 01:54:08,060
it's dad's house, you know? All your shit is at mom's house. There's nothing to do at dad's house.

822
01:54:08,860 --> 01:54:13,500
But when I would visit my dad, actually, I think they're like, you know, it adds to the character,

823
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:20,620
it adds to the cuteness. But like, I had a TV at my dad's house, so I would sometimes bring CDs and

824
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:29,420
watch Shrek. Born to sleep, forced to be awake. Born to shit, forced to wipe.

825
01:54:29,420 --> 01:54:38,460
Dad lore. I don't have much dad lore. Um, I don't know. I forced my dad to buy me rats. Okay,

826
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:43,500
I didn't force my dad to buy me rats. But when I was first getting rats, I was like,

827
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:48,140
my dad wanted to hang out with me. And so he texted me and he was like, hey, do you want to,

828
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:53,100
I feel like sometimes he like gets, goes through phases where he feels bad for being an absent

829
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:59,260
parent. So back then I would answer his texts. And I'd be like, he wants, he texts me and he

830
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:05,100
was like, hey, can we like, are you free today? Like, you know, we can do something together. And

831
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:14,620
I was like, sure, I need to ride to, I need to ride, I need to ride to go pick up a pet. And he was

832
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:22,540
like, yeah, okay, I'll drive you. And um, we went and I picked up rats. And he was like, what are

833
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:26,540
they? And I was like, rats. And he was like, Oh, yeah. Well, then he looked at them and he

834
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:32,940
were like, they're kind of cute, I guess. And then I, we went to go pick up like, oh, and he paid

835
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:36,700
for them. He paid for them. Because like, like I said, he sometimes I feel like he goes through

836
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:44,540
phases where he feels bad. So he paid for them. And then I was like, Oh, actually, dad, I need to go

837
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:57,260
get some. Oh, actually, dad, I need to go get some, you know, some stuff for my rats. So we went to

838
01:55:57,260 --> 01:56:01,820
PetSmart. And then he, and then I realized he was going to pay for everything. So I like,

839
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:08,140
filled up the cart like a lot. I filled up the cart a lot. And he paid for everything. And I was

840
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:16,380
like, Hey, dad, I actually, I actually need to go get a cage to it. So it's, can we go get that too?

841
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:27,900
And he was like, Okay. And then I made him paid for the cage. And then I didn't see him for like

842
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:39,420
another couple more years. So yeah, that's that's how I got um, that's the story of how I got rats.

843
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:47,820
My dad got them for me. Because, you know, probably because he feels bad, as he should feel bad.

844
01:56:48,700 --> 01:57:03,100
Oh, that one's too long. And it was an expensive trip. It was like, I don't want to say $600, but like,

845
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:08,700
rats are expensive. Okay, rats are really expensive. Okay, I think that's good.

846
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:15,900
Um, I think I feel like I should make the ears a little thicker.

847
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:21,340
Good girl. Real. I am a good girl. Ready sis?

848
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:30,220
Now you have big brother to buy you things. That's true. Will you buy me more rats? I think,

849
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:38,060
um, I think I'll make the the ears a little bit thicker, just a little bit.

850
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:43,900
And a little bit pointier too, because the cat has like really big ears, and that's what makes it really cute.

851
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:53,180
She's going to end up with 100 rats. No, I'm kidding. I know it's sad, but I don't know. I'm

852
01:57:53,740 --> 01:58:02,060
I'm not quite sure if I'll get more rats. I every time I always say that I always say that I'm like,

853
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:06,780
no, I don't think I should get more rats. And then I end up getting more rats and um,

854
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:14,700
it's kind of an addiction, but it's like, it's just so painful losing them, because they're so,

855
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:22,700
they're so, they're so filled with personality, and um, they live so short, kind of like a VTuber.

856
01:58:24,860 --> 01:58:28,060
They kind of, it's kind of like a VTuber, you know, they're so filled with personality,

857
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:31,660
and you fall in love with them, and then they graduate, and um, after two years,

858
01:58:31,660 --> 01:58:36,300
yeah, and then they graduate after like two years, and it's like, damn, man.

859
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:41,820
Rats are the same way, except instead of graduating, they fucking die.

860
01:58:43,660 --> 01:58:47,580
Sometimes if you're lucky, you can get a three years out of one, but you got to be lucky.

861
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:52,300
Cease.

862
01:58:56,140 --> 01:59:01,980
Emmy, please don't for shadow. I'm not saying I'll graduate after two years.

863
01:59:03,020 --> 01:59:10,220
I'm just saying that's just how VTubers are a lot of the times. Um, but you know, I've been,

864
01:59:12,140 --> 01:59:17,260
I've been streaming on and off since like the second year of college, so I've been streaming for

865
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:22,700
a long time, and I don't, I don't know, I don't intend on leaving. When you leave me first,

866
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:29,180
then I'll leave. How about that? You have to leave me first, okay? And then I'll go too. We'll just

867
01:59:29,180 --> 01:59:44,940
die together. No. Talk to author slash YouTuber Jay Ishiro Finney, something, some, some, some time

868
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:53,100
about rats. He has many. I've had many too. I don't know. It's always painful.

869
01:59:57,180 --> 02:00:03,500
You're stuck here. Deal no take backsies. If Emmy Beezer has zero fans, I'm dead.

870
02:00:04,940 --> 02:00:10,940
There. When you leave, I'll leave too. We both leave together. But yeah, like, I, I always say,

871
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:15,260
oh, I can't do it. I can't get more rats. And then I end up getting more rats.

872
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:22,140
Because I always, I don't know, it's kind of my fault too, that they kind of die early, not because

873
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:27,900
I take bad care of them. But when I get a rat, like I said earlier, I don't, I don't go to a breeder.

874
02:00:28,860 --> 02:00:36,700
I'm just not that kind of bitch. Because breeders will, like, charge like $40 per rat. And I always

875
02:00:36,780 --> 02:00:41,180
get my rats in pairs, because I feel bad like taking them away from their friends. So I get

876
02:00:41,180 --> 02:00:47,100
them in pairs. And it's like, I'm not paying $80 for rats. Hey, I can go in the trash and find a

877
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:52,860
rat for free, you know? So I always just like go on the Canadian version of Craigslist and find

878
02:00:52,860 --> 02:01:01,500
whoever's giving away like feeder rats or like accident babies rats. And I just get those ones,

879
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:05,980
you know? And I know that's bad, because those are the rats that will die first.

880
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:11,500
Kind of like Esteban, you know, that's kind of, that's, that was basically Esteban. She,

881
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:19,020
she was a feeder rat. So those, those are the ones that are not going to be healthy.

882
02:01:19,900 --> 02:01:26,060
And they will die very quickly from health issues, because they weren't really bred to live.

883
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:32,700
They were bred to be eaten by snakes and shit. So yeah, it means just, just go searching in the

884
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:40,380
trash. I will. I will. That's where I'll find my next rat. At least you're giving them a good life.

885
02:01:40,380 --> 02:01:49,260
I am, but it's painful for me. It's painful for me. And sometimes I need to limit myself,

886
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:57,980
which is really hard because I don't like doing that. I want all the rats.

887
02:02:00,700 --> 02:02:01,660
Is that thick enough?

888
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:08,860
I think it's thick enough, but I think I need to round the tops a little more.

889
02:02:09,580 --> 02:02:17,180
Careful with the bites. I know, I know, I've been bitten. The, the, the feeders tend to bite too.

890
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:23,420
They tend to bite, because they're not used to human interaction. But sometimes they'll get used

891
02:02:23,420 --> 02:02:27,420
to you and they'll stop biting. And sometimes they won't. It really just depends on the rat.

892
02:02:29,660 --> 02:02:33,260
Risks are like that. They deserve good lives, but they will bring you heartbreak that much sooner.

893
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:41,260
Man, I'm getting sad.

894
02:02:47,980 --> 02:02:52,060
Oh, thank you for the two dollars. Gotta bounce. I'll watch the rest in VOD. Okay, bye-bye.

895
02:02:52,860 --> 02:02:58,700
Does a rat can count as nine rats or one giant rat on checkout? I think it counts as nine rats.

896
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:04,460
They'll get all the money they can from you, at least at the pet store. They will get all the money

897
02:03:04,460 --> 02:03:11,500
they can. Bronx rat? What's Bronx rat? Why are they called feeder? Because they're bred to be fed

898
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:13,820
two snakes. Yeah.

899
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:25,980
Okay, I think I'm done. I kind of want to add blushies. Okay, I'll add, I'll add a little,

900
02:03:25,980 --> 02:03:33,260
I got another footprint. I'll add, I'll add a little bit of pink blushies and then I'll be done,

901
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:38,700
because I feel like it would fit nicely with this pink. My pet is not doing great, so the thought

902
02:03:38,700 --> 02:03:43,740
of suffering that every couple of years gives an incredible amount of respect for you and your love

903
02:03:43,740 --> 02:03:57,420
for your rats. Thank you. I don't know, it's um, it is hard, but like, the happy times kind of like,

904
02:03:58,620 --> 02:04:07,020
um, overshadow the sad times kind of, you know. Thank you for the membership. Thank you.

905
02:04:09,180 --> 02:04:12,220
Bronx is New York City. What about Bronx?

906
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:17,180
What about little dots in the back that look like stars around the cat?

907
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:19,580
That's going to be hard. I don't have that much, um,

908
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:27,100
I don't have that much, um, control. Um,

909
02:04:29,740 --> 02:04:34,860
it's really hard to, it's, it's a, it's, um, much harder to paint on a shirt than it is on a canvas.

910
02:04:35,820 --> 02:04:43,420
It's a lot less, um, you know, the shirt, the shirt moves around a lot, um, and so,

911
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:49,740
yeah, um, I'm trying to, I'm trying to be like simple.

912
02:04:52,540 --> 02:04:56,060
Eh, huh, dammit, I got pink on this.

913
02:04:59,340 --> 02:05:03,420
There's lots of rats in the Bronx. I'm not going to go all the way to New York City for a rat.

914
02:05:03,500 --> 02:05:06,380
Like I said, I could find one in my backyard if I try hard enough.

915
02:05:08,380 --> 02:05:13,100
Even if it hurts, it's better to feel something than nothing. Real and true, real and true.

916
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:18,540
That's exactly how I feel. Dammit, I put way too much pink out.

917
02:05:18,540 --> 02:05:32,060
Okay, we're going to do a little bit of pink.

918
02:05:34,460 --> 02:05:42,220
Pizza rat? Every rat will, will take the pizza. Rats will eat anything. They will all eat the pizza.

919
02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:52,780
Is this a good pink? I feel like that must be a little dark. Can you even see me mixing? Oh, you can.

920
02:05:55,580 --> 02:05:59,660
The rats in New York City are as big as house cats. Did you know there's actually like different

921
02:05:59,660 --> 02:06:04,060
species of rats that have started evolving, evolving specific to New York City?

922
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:09,660
Yeah, isn't that crazy? The rats are winning, guys.

923
02:06:10,460 --> 02:06:11,900
They're evolving to take over.

924
02:06:16,300 --> 02:06:17,980
Oh man, I didn't mix enough.

925
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:22,300
Aw, so cute.

926
02:06:29,660 --> 02:06:33,900
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up with the blush?

927
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:37,260
Aw, let me mix more.

928
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:43,260
Did I just ruin it? Do you think it looks bad? Be honest. Should I make it more pink?

929
02:06:45,340 --> 02:06:49,340
I'm pretty sure the only New York City rat that matters is Master Splinter. I don't know who that

930
02:06:49,340 --> 02:06:52,300
is. Is that the rat from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or something?

931
02:06:58,460 --> 02:07:01,900
Cats don't blush? Well, this one does because it's an anime cat.

932
02:07:03,980 --> 02:07:08,700
I don't know. Should I? Okay, let me try it. It looks good to me. It looks fine.

933
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:15,820
You're lying. You're lying to my face. Let me try to even it out.

934
02:07:15,820 --> 02:07:35,740
Oh, this is like the opposite of even. I need to make the other one bigger now.

935
02:07:46,220 --> 02:07:52,380
There we go. Is that cute? Say yes. Say yes.

936
02:07:56,940 --> 02:08:01,180
I think I got to add more here. There we go.

937
02:08:03,820 --> 02:08:12,780
That was so cute. I think it's cute. I don't know. For a quick little painting, I think it's cute.

938
02:08:13,580 --> 02:08:18,780
It's cute. I feel like it's cuter in person on stream. It doesn't look as cute. I don't know why.

939
02:08:21,660 --> 02:08:25,420
I kind of feel like... I don't know. Do you think?

940
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:30,780
Do you think the blush is too close to the eyes or is it okay?

941
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:38,380
It's a little bit derpy looking. I'm not gonna lie. Gigi needs hugs. He does.

942
02:08:38,540 --> 02:08:49,340
What was quick? The painting? Can you make a shirt for us too? Maybe one day.

943
02:08:57,100 --> 02:09:02,220
I'd buy it. It's fine. Okay.

944
02:09:02,780 --> 02:09:06,620
Let me see what it looks like.

945
02:09:11,980 --> 02:09:14,380
Let me take it out of the cardboard.

946
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:21,980
Actually, that's a bad idea. Oh, it got stuck to the cardboard.

947
02:09:32,940 --> 02:09:36,860
I'm trying to just fan it out as a regular shirt, but I'm scared I'm gonna get paint everywhere.

948
02:09:37,660 --> 02:09:44,460
Just so you can see. Oh, I got paint here. Oh my god. I'm so stupid. Move the paint.

949
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:53,980
There. Just so you can see it as what it looks like as a shirt.

950
02:09:58,620 --> 02:09:59,420
There's the shirt.

951
02:10:02,220 --> 02:10:06,540
It's cute, I think. I don't know. It kind of looks like the thing one and thing two kind of shirts,

952
02:10:07,580 --> 02:10:12,540
but it's cute enough. Maybe I should... I'm debating on whether or not I should draw

953
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:19,420
like a circle around it. I don't think I have black. Do I have black? If I had black, it would be really helpful.

954
02:10:23,180 --> 02:10:25,820
No, I definitely don't have black. Damn it.

955
02:10:32,540 --> 02:10:36,460
Okay, well, good enough. That's gonna be her shirt.

956
02:10:40,780 --> 02:10:51,340
I think it looks better without an outline. Okay, if you say so. Let me try to clean up a

957
02:10:51,340 --> 02:10:57,500
little bit because I still want to chat. Oh, should I chat on the floor? Maybe I'll just chat on the

958
02:10:57,500 --> 02:11:03,020
floor. Hold on. I wanted to clean up a little bit and sit in my chair so we can chat a little bit,

959
02:11:03,020 --> 02:11:10,380
but maybe I'll just chat while on the floor. Hold on. There.

960
02:11:15,820 --> 02:11:25,660
Okay, and I'm gonna turn off the camera and move it away from me.

961
02:11:27,820 --> 02:11:33,260
And just chat like this. Okay, on the floor still.

962
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:38,620
Let me open chat. Hold on.

963
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:45,820
Okay, and also go...

964
02:11:46,620 --> 02:11:48,620
How do I...

965
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:57,100
Go to the live part of the stream.

966
02:11:58,780 --> 02:12:05,900
Okay, there we go. This is on the floor floor time. What the fuck did PewDiePie call it floor gang?

967
02:12:06,460 --> 02:12:17,500
Hi, cutie. You need to wear it and take a pic. I'm not gonna wear it. I'm not gonna wear it.

968
02:12:18,220 --> 02:12:31,660
It's for my mom. And plus, my mom likes really tight shirts.

969
02:12:32,380 --> 02:12:38,540
I got a small just for her, and I hate tight shirts. I hate it. It makes me so uncomfortable.

970
02:12:38,540 --> 02:12:43,980
Rant about women's shirts, but I don't know if it's a women's shirt. I haven't checked,

971
02:12:45,340 --> 02:12:54,540
but women's shirts are just so uncomfortable to me because they make them smaller specifically

972
02:12:54,540 --> 02:12:57,900
because it's a women's shirt, but not only do they make them smaller, like I know,

973
02:12:57,900 --> 02:13:03,500
oh naturally women are smaller than men. Whatever. I don't care. But not only do they make them smaller

974
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:11,260
in size, like fitted shirts like for women like hug your waist, and that makes me feel really

975
02:13:11,260 --> 02:13:16,860
claustrophobic around my waist, and not only do they hug your waist, they have really, really small

976
02:13:19,980 --> 02:13:25,340
sleeves. Like if it's a t-shirt, the sleeve area, like the armpit area is really, really tight,

977
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:31,740
and the sleeve, if it's a t-shirt, the sleeve is like tiny. Like it's not even a t-shirt, it's like

978
02:13:31,740 --> 02:13:36,300
a tank top with a little bit of extra fabric because it barely goes over your fucking shoulders.

979
02:13:37,340 --> 02:13:43,340
And so I hate women's t-shirts, and I hate women's shirts in general, but my mom loves them,

980
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:45,980
so I specifically got like a really small shirt for her.

981
02:13:46,940 --> 02:13:55,820
Um, you need big bros long shirts? I do. I do. I don't wear women's t-shirts. I, uh,

982
02:13:56,380 --> 02:14:03,660
I don't because I hate them so much. I know what you mean. Yeah, tight sleeves, tight sleeves,

983
02:14:03,660 --> 02:14:09,580
and also like tight armpit, like my fucking armpit is getting suffocated here. I'm a sweater, like

984
02:14:09,580 --> 02:14:16,140
there's not enough fabric in, in my armpit to like, um, catch all this sweat. Like it's

985
02:14:16,140 --> 02:14:19,660
hugging my armpit, and it's making me sweaty, and there's just not enough fabric on this t-shirt

986
02:14:19,660 --> 02:14:25,740
to catch all my armpit sweat. Women's clothes seems so adversal to people who are supposed

987
02:14:25,740 --> 02:14:34,060
to be wearing them. It does, in general, yeah, it does. Oh my god, I just got sent a link by one

988
02:14:34,060 --> 02:14:37,420
of my Vtuber friends about Vtuber drama. I love drama.

989
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:47,100
I did see that situation. Yes, Kaifu. I'll never know what we're talking about.

990
02:14:47,820 --> 02:14:52,540
She just sent me some drama. We, we talk about Vtuber drama.

991
02:14:56,860 --> 02:14:59,580
Tell us if mom loves this shirt. She'll like it. She'll like it.

992
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:10,780
Drama spill it? No, I'm not allowed to. I'm not allowed to. I shouldn't, but I like it. I like,

993
02:15:10,780 --> 02:15:19,980
I like, I like the drama because, how do I say this, um, oopsies, I clicked on the wrong thing,

994
02:15:20,060 --> 02:15:32,460
hold on. I like the drama not because it involves me or like is related to me, but I feel like,

995
02:15:34,300 --> 02:15:41,180
I feel like, I don't know how to describe it without telling you what it is, whatever,

996
02:15:41,180 --> 02:15:48,700
whatever, I won't talk about it. I'm just happy about it. I'm so evil. I'm so evil, oh my god.

997
02:15:50,940 --> 02:15:55,180
I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's not my big drama. It doesn't involve me at all. It doesn't

998
02:15:55,180 --> 02:16:01,660
involve Veeler or anything. Don't worry. Immular new drama channel. No, she even wanted to do that.

999
02:16:01,660 --> 02:16:05,100
Oh, I'm not, she didn't want to do specifically drama. She wanted to do Vtuber news.

1000
02:16:06,460 --> 02:16:11,900
Yeah, I love Vtuber drama on Twitter. It's my, it's my favorite too. It's always so petty. It's

1001
02:16:11,900 --> 02:16:13,340
always so petty and stupid.

1002
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:29,340
Girls look cuter in baggy shirts anyways. They do. They do. The smaller, the more expensive they are.

1003
02:16:29,340 --> 02:16:34,300
It's insane. I have a pigeon. Oh my god. He costs more than my dog and two cats together.

1004
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:39,420
Are you tall by any chance? Not really. I'm not short either.

1005
02:16:39,420 --> 02:16:48,860
Fine. Keep your secrets.

1006
02:16:51,660 --> 02:16:58,940
Drama is good if bad. People are exposed. Unfortunately, this drama is not about

1007
02:17:00,540 --> 02:17:07,820
any exposed stuff really. Vtuber culture is like a non-stop soap opera. It is, it is,

1008
02:17:07,820 --> 02:17:13,900
and that's why I love it. I don't like being involved in drama myself. I keep to myself a lot.

1009
02:17:15,900 --> 02:17:23,580
I keep to myself, but I love reading about other people's drama. Oh no. Hello? Oh, there we go.

1010
02:17:23,580 --> 02:17:29,980
I love reading about other people's drama. I know it's bad. I know I shouldn't say that,

1011
02:17:29,980 --> 02:17:32,220
but I like reading about other people's drama.

1012
02:17:37,900 --> 02:17:41,180
I'm surprised Shibi hasn't done that yet. I think she's planning it. She's definitely

1013
02:17:41,180 --> 02:17:45,660
planning it. She really wants to, it seems like. I'm also here about the drama around the big

1014
02:17:45,660 --> 02:17:52,300
agencies. I hear about that too, but I also like the drama around the indies as well.

1015
02:17:53,820 --> 02:17:58,860
Waiting for the Emmy apology stream? I don't think I really said anything or done anything.

1016
02:17:58,860 --> 02:18:09,100
I need to apologize for other than like existing, but I'm like not gonna apologize. I'm not gonna

1017
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:18,540
apologize. So yeah. V-Tweeter drama. Some dramas just delicious to watch. It's delicious when it

1018
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:25,660
doesn't, it's delicious when it doesn't involve me, you know? Everyone hears about the drama with

1019
02:18:25,660 --> 02:18:31,180
big agencies. That's the big agency's blessings slash curse. Yeah, yeah, that's true. But people

1020
02:18:31,180 --> 02:18:36,700
hear about the drama with small agencies too, which is not as much. My phone is dying soon.

1021
02:18:44,060 --> 02:18:46,460
It's all fun and games until death threats are involved?

1022
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:53,180
Yeah, that's true, obviously. As long as it stays a leafling read. Hi! We finished painting the

1023
02:18:53,180 --> 02:18:58,620
shirt. Sorry, now we're just yapping a little bit. Yeah, we finished painting the shirt, but hello!

1024
02:18:58,620 --> 02:19:07,100
Jimmy Ray! Hi, leaflings! Unless someone does something truly horrible or illegal, I don't care

1025
02:19:07,100 --> 02:19:19,500
about drama. That's fair. I don't care, but I like it. I love it. I'm kind of, I know I shouldn't,

1026
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:25,900
I'm evil, not evil, but I'm uh, I'm bad for that. It's a bad habit of mine.

1027
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:35,100
Hi! What did you guys, what were you guys up to? I gotta, I gotta stalk a little bit.

1028
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:42,860
Oh, are you playing Sonic Heroes?

1029
02:19:50,220 --> 02:19:55,500
Oh, you're playing vermin, vermin tide. Wait, what's vermin tide?

1030
02:19:55,500 --> 02:20:06,220
That's why they made drama shows. Yeah! Sonic was yesterday. Immediately slipping up drama.

1031
02:20:07,980 --> 02:20:13,820
It does get out of hand fast. Where it stops being drama starts being court proceedings or

1032
02:20:13,820 --> 02:20:19,100
international news. I, how did the shirt come out? It came out well. It came out cute. You can go back

1033
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:25,820
in the stream and look at it if you, um, if you, am I looking at you when I look down? Hold on.

1034
02:20:29,740 --> 02:20:36,220
I think I'm looking down. I'm looking at the, at the, the, now I'm looking at you. I don't know.

1035
02:20:36,780 --> 02:20:41,420
My, um, my iPhone's like at a, at a different um, height than usual.

1036
02:20:41,420 --> 02:20:46,700
We're trying to convince me to spill the tea.

1037
02:20:49,420 --> 02:20:56,140
Vermin tide is killing bipedal rap people. I'm never playing that game then.

1038
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:04,620
Isn't drama like the best selling category or anything? It is

1039
02:21:05,580 --> 02:21:13,900
Jimmy Peace. Why are you calling, why are you calling me Jimmy? Is it because I called myself Jimmy one time?

1040
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:24,540
Yeah, it's, I, I think Vtuber drama is mostly contained in the Vtuber community. The only time

1041
02:21:24,540 --> 02:21:33,900
I've ever seen Vtuber drama hit like, not mainstream audience, but like more people outside of the

1042
02:21:33,900 --> 02:21:40,540
community is with the Salen situation. I've, I've, I was scrolling through TikTok and I saw

1043
02:21:40,540 --> 02:21:47,420
someone completely unrelated to Vtubers cover that topic. Thank you for the two months of membership.

1044
02:21:47,420 --> 02:21:57,020
Thank you. To be fair, the rats are very evil. That's, that's fine. They can be evil. Nothing

1045
02:21:57,020 --> 02:22:00,460
wrong with being a little evil. Everyone, everyone deserves to be a little evil sometimes.

1046
02:22:00,780 --> 02:22:08,140
That was the only time I actually saw drama hit outside of the Vtuber community. It mostly stays

1047
02:22:08,140 --> 02:22:16,860
inside of the Vtuber community. Yeah, yeah, Salen's termination and like everything that followed

1048
02:22:16,860 --> 02:22:31,980
after that, that situation. Yeah, how dare you call rats evil? Not in this part too.

1049
02:22:33,580 --> 02:22:40,700
A doki drama is what made aware Vtubers even exist. Now I'm here watching you all. Oh, interesting.

1050
02:22:41,020 --> 02:22:49,660
Oh, there was like three dramas this morning. Three. Oh, you're deep into, you're deep into Vtuber

1051
02:22:49,660 --> 02:22:59,100
drama, aren't you? Three this morning. Yeah. And Ludwig talked about Rusha. Oh, okay. Wait,

1052
02:22:59,100 --> 02:23:06,860
when Rusha graduated or like the thing with Rusha and Mafumafu, what, what, what thing?

1053
02:23:07,580 --> 02:23:12,940
I don't know how big the Mafumafu Rusha stuff was. I feel like it was kind of big.

1054
02:23:14,380 --> 02:23:18,060
Doki drama, Gora at the stadium, mm-hmm, Gora at the stadium was kind of big too.

1055
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:25,260
For sure. Yeah, there is some old Vtuber drama every day and I love it. I love it so much. Like

1056
02:23:26,220 --> 02:23:35,500
the, the, I forgot her name. The girl that like accused someone of copying her and it was like,

1057
02:23:37,420 --> 02:23:41,500
I don't know. I'm surprised I never got, I never got canceled for copying, uh,

1058
02:23:43,660 --> 02:23:51,900
uh, what's your name? Muffet. I was Walmart Muffet. Oh God, Rusha.

1059
02:23:54,620 --> 02:24:01,660
Rusha didn't graduate, sorry. Terminated. Termination. Rusha got, Rusha got terminated.

1060
02:24:01,660 --> 02:24:07,260
Sorry, you're right, you're right. It was big in Japan? I mean, yeah, Rusha was pretty big, right?

1061
02:24:10,460 --> 02:24:17,020
Yeah, um, no, I'm talking about, uh, there was a shy Lily situation, but there was also the,

1062
02:24:17,020 --> 02:24:26,060
another one more recent than that. She became a terminator. Yeah, she was, I think she still

1063
02:24:26,060 --> 02:24:33,260
is the biggest hololive earner, which is crazy. Um, but honestly, I watched, okay, listen, I don't

1064
02:24:33,260 --> 02:24:42,860
condone anything that, um, hold on, I need to move my ring light, hold on. Come on. Uh, turn that

1065
02:24:42,860 --> 02:24:52,300
freaking light lower. Okay, I don't condone anything that Rusha has done, but I watched some of her clips

1066
02:24:52,300 --> 02:24:58,220
and she's good at what she does. Okay, that's all I'm going to say. She's good at what she does,

1067
02:24:58,220 --> 02:25:07,260
and I see why she was popular, um, because she's good at what she does. I watched her clips and I

1068
02:25:07,260 --> 02:25:14,540
was like, damn, this girl knows how to, this girl knows what people like to hear kind of, you know,

1069
02:25:14,540 --> 02:25:19,740
this girl, this girl knows how to, how to role play, I guess, or I guess in her situation,

1070
02:25:19,740 --> 02:25:27,580
it wasn't even role playing, it was just real. Um, the Twitch drama just has everyone panicking

1071
02:25:27,580 --> 02:25:32,620
too in the Vtuber space and streamers in general. Wait, what Twitch drama? Moist Critical mentioned

1072
02:25:32,620 --> 02:25:41,420
Rusha, really? Yeah, when, when like, when like, YouTubers, um, and like, Twitch streamers mentioned

1073
02:25:41,420 --> 02:25:47,340
Vtuber drama, that's when you know it got big. Oh, Coco had the most, she was second, wait, really?

1074
02:25:49,740 --> 02:25:53,260
Your experience is Vtuber drama happening more than regular streamer drama? Because I've never

1075
02:25:53,260 --> 02:25:56,860
interacted with streaming at all before VTubers, and I don't know if it's actually more drama than

1076
02:25:56,860 --> 02:26:03,100
IRL. I don't know actually. I feel like there is more drama in the Vtuber community, but I've never

1077
02:26:03,100 --> 02:26:13,660
interacted with the IRL streamer community that much. Rusha is not just the biggest hollow earner,

1078
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:17,580
she's still one of the 10 biggest earners of all time on YouTube. Holy shit.

1079
02:26:20,460 --> 02:26:26,620
She does need therapy. Azman Gold's got a whole video on any color drama. Oh, yeah,

1080
02:26:26,620 --> 02:26:33,180
that's when you know it's big. She actually got engaged with a fan IRL? Rusha?

1081
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:41,980
Like right now or before? I know she sold um, she sold engagement rings, right? That was, listen,

1082
02:26:42,700 --> 02:26:49,100
I know some people are like, ew, that's so cringe. Why would she, I think it's funny. I think it's

1083
02:26:49,100 --> 02:26:57,740
funny. I think it's campy. I know she was married. I know she was married. I still, like,

1084
02:26:59,420 --> 02:27:03,740
like when, I think when it came out that she used to sell engagement rings as like merch,

1085
02:27:03,740 --> 02:27:07,100
people were like, what the fuck? Who would buy an engagement ring? I think it's campy.

1086
02:27:08,140 --> 02:27:16,940
Um, did you see how Mikko acted in the rest server? The streamers in that server used

1087
02:27:17,020 --> 02:27:21,900
her as well. Cali was crazy. I don't know what that means. How does she act?

1088
02:27:29,340 --> 02:27:36,700
Twitch, two Twitch dramas going on going. The karaoke ban and the anyone can collab with anyone

1089
02:27:36,700 --> 02:27:41,900
else, whether the second streamer wants it or not thing. Oh, I didn't know there was a karaoke ban.

1090
02:27:41,900 --> 02:27:48,380
I mean, there's basically a karaoke ban on YouTube too because your video gets automatically

1091
02:27:48,380 --> 02:27:56,860
demonetized. Um, I did hear about the collab thing. I don't quite know what it is, but I did

1092
02:27:56,860 --> 02:28:03,100
hear that like you have to, it's automatically like turned on. I'm not sure if that's true.

1093
02:28:03,100 --> 02:28:07,900
Like something about like, okay, I have to turn off the slides too much for me. Oh, I'm so old.

1094
02:28:07,900 --> 02:28:17,980
I can't have lights in my face. Sorry. Um, it was like, if you, I got to turn off this other light

1095
02:28:17,980 --> 02:28:28,540
too. Hold on. Where's the light? Oh, that's so much better. It was like, actually, maybe I should

1096
02:28:28,540 --> 02:28:34,780
try and keep it on. It was like, uh, you can like request a collab with anyone if you're both,

1097
02:28:35,660 --> 02:28:42,060
if you're both, um, Twitch affiliates, affiliates, is that what it was?

1098
02:28:45,340 --> 02:28:49,580
Where's our ring in me? I don't know if we have the budget for rings now. Come on.

1099
02:28:51,100 --> 02:28:55,260
She was just unaware of how rust is as a game we got, but her when people were mean to her,

1100
02:28:55,820 --> 02:29:01,900
when she wasn't being helpful and she ended up crying. Oh, shit. Oh, begging to be part of

1101
02:29:01,900 --> 02:29:08,780
people's groups and getting KOS. I don't know what that means. On site. Killed on site. Is that what

1102
02:29:08,780 --> 02:29:18,620
it means? She stole resources from to give to. We need a member only drama gossip stream. No,

1103
02:29:18,620 --> 02:29:23,580
because it's still going to get clipped and people are going to be like, oh my God, it means such a drama whore.

1104
02:29:24,300 --> 02:29:40,700
It is. Yeah, it was that one. You can just give me a strip of aluminum foil shaped like a ring.

1105
02:29:42,140 --> 02:29:46,140
You can trick the system, but not turn it off. And apparently the ambassador that is pushing

1106
02:29:46,140 --> 02:29:49,260
it is being outed as a creep and a groomer of other VTubers. What?

1107
02:29:49,660 --> 02:29:54,140
What? Holy crap.

1108
02:29:58,060 --> 02:30:02,940
Her original clan found out she was kicked out and then went around the rest of the server

1109
02:30:03,980 --> 02:30:11,100
chasing people. That's strange.

1110
02:30:11,980 --> 02:30:17,980
These rules are a lot harsher and can strike your channel while live, not just vods.

1111
02:30:19,420 --> 02:30:25,740
That's weird. Karaoke. Why do, why do, why do they hate Karaoke's? I know a lot of VTubers aren't

1112
02:30:25,740 --> 02:30:29,900
good at singing, but a lot of VTubers are good at singing because that's like a huge part of

1113
02:30:29,900 --> 02:30:34,780
being a VTuber is singing. So like, why do they hate us and Karaoke's?

1114
02:30:36,940 --> 02:30:40,780
You have to set it to favorites only and then never add anyone to favorites. That's so weird.

1115
02:30:41,580 --> 02:30:48,220
It apparently turns your webcam on or something. I heard that, but that's,

1116
02:30:48,940 --> 02:30:53,580
that's too weird. That's something that I feel like Twitch wouldn't make. I don't know about it

1117
02:30:53,580 --> 02:30:59,260
because I'm no longer on YouTube. I mean on Twitch, but that feels like something Twitch wouldn't do.

1118
02:30:59,260 --> 02:31:03,260
Like why would they make a thing that turns your webcam on automatically

1119
02:31:03,260 --> 02:31:06,780
for collabs? That sounds weird and strange and stupid. I feel like they wouldn't do that.

1120
02:31:11,900 --> 02:31:16,060
Ahem. Twitch doesn't hate Karaoke's. They hate VTubers.

1121
02:31:19,580 --> 02:31:25,420
Possibly. I don't know. I feel like Twitch is just really inconsistent, but so is YouTube.

1122
02:31:25,420 --> 02:31:27,420
Like every big platform is inconsistent.

1123
02:31:34,620 --> 02:31:39,020
It turns your camera on if you are the person who is requesting the collab, not if you accept.

1124
02:31:39,580 --> 02:31:45,740
Why? I mean, first of all, why? I feel like it's really, it's really strange to do this whole

1125
02:31:45,740 --> 02:31:53,660
collab request thing. Like if it's your friend and they're streaming and you want to collab with them,

1126
02:31:53,660 --> 02:31:56,060
just text them and be like, Hey, let's stream together. You know,

1127
02:31:57,260 --> 02:32:01,980
I don't know. Does it like show both streams at once? Like how does the collab, like if

1128
02:32:01,980 --> 02:32:06,380
both people do the collab, how does it work? Does it show both streams at once? Is that how

1129
02:32:06,380 --> 02:32:13,820
it's different? Because then I would understand. But if it's just like, like what does it do? I'm confused.

1130
02:32:18,140 --> 02:32:21,900
You just have to have express permission for the copyright holders, which might as well be banned.

1131
02:32:22,700 --> 02:32:25,980
I won't go text Taylor Swift and ask her if I can use her music in my karaoke.

1132
02:32:28,940 --> 02:32:32,700
An archive does not enough. You can get Bong to live if it's anything other than a public domain

1133
02:32:32,780 --> 02:32:37,500
composition or your own original music. What the fuck? What if I pitch it up and call it a

1134
02:32:37,500 --> 02:32:48,780
nightcore remix and then sing it like that? I got it. Oh, hold on. Okay. I've been leaning like a shrimp.

1135
02:32:51,900 --> 02:32:55,580
The creep pushing this feature also has a history of going into small vtubers chat

1136
02:32:55,580 --> 02:33:01,740
with his ambassador medal and forcing himself into voice calls. What the fuck?

1137
02:33:03,660 --> 02:33:06,460
That's so weird. That's so strange.

1138
02:33:16,700 --> 02:33:20,780
The webcam thing sounds like fearmongering. It kind of does because I feel like,

1139
02:33:21,500 --> 02:33:23,340
I feel like Twitch wouldn't do that. That's stupid.

1140
02:33:24,060 --> 02:33:30,380
Nightcore loophole, literally. And people shit on me for liking nightcore, bro.

1141
02:33:33,980 --> 02:33:38,460
On popular opinion, I think nightcore is good. I think nightcore is good music. I like to listen

1142
02:33:38,460 --> 02:33:45,900
to nightcore and I think it's catchy. And I think people who don't like it or no, I think people who

1143
02:33:45,900 --> 02:33:52,140
adamantly are against nightcore just hate fun. They hate fun and they hate joy and they hate a

1144
02:33:52,140 --> 02:34:03,020
little bit of silly Billy goofing around. Okay. A lot of people really hate nightcore and don't

1145
02:34:03,020 --> 02:34:07,740
think it's real music. Sure, whatever, but it's just, it's just, turn off your brain for a second.

1146
02:34:07,740 --> 02:34:12,140
It's literally just, it's just sped up and higher pitched. Like it's fun. You like anime girls that

1147
02:34:12,140 --> 02:34:18,380
are high pitched, so you should like nightcore. Like what's wrong with it? It's fine. There's

1148
02:34:18,380 --> 02:34:23,660
really good nightcore songs, but also a ton of really bad ones. Of course there is. Any song can

1149
02:34:23,660 --> 02:34:30,460
sound both good and bad nightcore or a fight. It's just the editor that did it, you know?

1150
02:34:31,100 --> 02:34:36,860
Like, same with any song can sound good or bad. Slow down. It's just really depends on who edited

1151
02:34:36,860 --> 02:34:44,060
it and who mixed it and who made it, you know, sound like that. They hate wonder. They do.

1152
02:34:44,300 --> 02:34:52,380
What the freak is nightcore? Nightcore is just like a remix of a song. It's like a genre of

1153
02:34:52,380 --> 02:34:57,020
remix where you speed it up and make it higher pitched. And that's basically all you do. You

1154
02:34:57,020 --> 02:35:02,780
can do other things and I've seen artists do a lot of really cooler edits with nightcore and still

1155
02:35:02,780 --> 02:35:09,980
put it in the nightcore genre, but generally it's just sped up and higher pitched. Why do people care

1156
02:35:10,060 --> 02:35:14,780
if people like something they don't? They're buttholes. They're annoying and they're buttholes.

1157
02:35:14,780 --> 02:35:20,540
They're annoying buttholes. They hate fun like I told you they hate fun. They hate me specifically

1158
02:35:20,540 --> 02:35:27,500
having fun. Yeah, there's good songs and bad songs in every genre, yeah.

1159
02:35:27,820 --> 02:35:42,380
Nightcore sues the neurotypical brain? The neurotypical? I don't know. You think neurotypical is like

1160
02:35:42,380 --> 02:35:57,820
nightcore? Silly Billy mentioned. I don't know. I just had a friend of mine that was like really

1161
02:35:57,820 --> 02:36:03,260
judgy about me liking nightcore. Even though it's like it's popular for a reason. It's because it's

1162
02:36:03,260 --> 02:36:08,780
catchy, okay? It's because it's catchy and because it's good. And now I'm thinking of a specific

1163
02:36:08,780 --> 02:36:20,540
nightcore song that I don't remember but it was really catchy. It was a weird part of my teens

1164
02:36:20,540 --> 02:36:25,420
what a time to be a weave. I listened to a lot of it too. We should do it. We should do a nightcore

1165
02:36:25,420 --> 02:36:33,980
karaoke one day. That would be that would be peak cringe nightcore karaoke where I only sing

1166
02:36:34,060 --> 02:36:38,540
nightcore songs. I don't know how I would do that because most nightcore songs don't have

1167
02:36:40,140 --> 02:36:48,060
instrumentals at all. But I should do that. Most nightcore songs don't have instrumentals

1168
02:36:48,060 --> 02:36:55,500
but I'll just sing over the nightcore part. It'd be a good breathing exercise. Am I the only one

1169
02:36:55,500 --> 02:37:00,700
that unironically likes Eurobeat? Okay, Eurobeat I don't know what that is. Is that just like European

1170
02:37:00,700 --> 02:37:04,940
music? Is that what is that what JoJo Siwa's new song is like? Is that Eurobeat?

1171
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:15,340
If you initiate the knock knock request your webcam automatically activates why though?

1172
02:37:16,780 --> 02:37:23,660
Why? Why? Is that a glitch or is that on purpose? Because like why? What's the point of that?

1173
02:37:24,300 --> 02:37:29,100
What if you don't have a webcam? Like my computer doesn't have a webcam so it does nothing?

1174
02:37:29,820 --> 02:37:32,860
Like I have to I have to plug in an external webcam.

1175
02:37:35,900 --> 02:37:37,020
That would be very unbranded.

1176
02:37:43,100 --> 02:37:46,380
Some people really go from I don't like this to no one should like this. Like they're the

1177
02:37:46,380 --> 02:37:51,740
single person who gets to decide what's good slash fun. True, true. Some people are just

1178
02:37:52,700 --> 02:38:03,180
um downers, downers. That's what they are. Still unclear about who JoJo Siwa is. JoJo Siwa is a

1179
02:38:03,180 --> 02:38:12,540
child star not star but kind of a child celebrity who got popular from dance moms which was a show

1180
02:38:12,540 --> 02:38:19,500
about kids dancing and I think she also did pageants I don't know. And now she she's still

1181
02:38:19,580 --> 02:38:27,500
made like kids content for a really long time but now she's more adult and she's trying to like

1182
02:38:28,380 --> 02:38:34,460
break into the adult sphere of like stuff like celebrity activities like making music

1183
02:38:34,460 --> 02:38:39,260
but everyone's just shitting on her because she's doing it in a really cringy way and also

1184
02:38:41,500 --> 02:38:48,060
I don't think this is mean. People make fun of her singing a lot and I feel like okay I can't

1185
02:38:48,860 --> 02:38:53,740
I can't judge her singing because like who what do I know about singing but I do feel like she

1186
02:38:53,740 --> 02:39:01,740
wasn't taught to sing any other way than like kids song way if that makes sense like like like like

1187
02:39:04,460 --> 02:39:04,940
like um

1188
02:39:07,420 --> 02:39:12,060
I literally like kids bop kind of singing like she wasn't taught how to sing like actually

1189
02:39:12,060 --> 02:39:18,460
sing I feel like she sings like kids bop kind of style and so you can kind of hear it in her

1190
02:39:18,460 --> 02:39:23,660
first song at least and then she's made other songs and she's had drama about like buying the

1191
02:39:23,660 --> 02:39:30,060
rights to songs and then singing them herself quote unquote people are still feel like sometimes

1192
02:39:30,060 --> 02:39:36,700
she doesn't completely replace the vocals with her own voice which is fair JoJo's bizarre adventure

1193
02:39:36,700 --> 02:39:42,700
no I thought you're gonna end the sentence that JoJo Siwa was a child she was a child

1194
02:39:43,340 --> 02:39:45,820
she's no longer a child but she was a child

1195
02:39:47,820 --> 02:39:54,140
eurobeat is running in the 90s oh eurobeat is what nightcore usually makes songs sound like

1196
02:39:56,460 --> 02:40:00,060
like you are you saying eurobeat sounds like sounds like nightcore

1197
02:40:00,620 --> 02:40:04,460
when you see the memes of people drifting in cars that music

1198
02:40:06,220 --> 02:40:12,380
if I if I if that's what I'm thinking of it kind of sounds cringe it's basically gas gas gas what

1199
02:40:12,380 --> 02:40:20,860
does that mean what does gas gas mean doom posting what me

1200
02:40:23,340 --> 02:40:27,100
she's trying yeah she's trying to Miley Cyrus but she's doing it in a little bit of a cringe

1201
02:40:27,180 --> 02:40:32,300
way and people are making fun of her for it activating someone's webcam without their

1202
02:40:32,300 --> 02:40:36,060
express consent is a violation of privacy and theory but I feel like rights on the internet

1203
02:40:36,060 --> 02:40:45,180
are becoming more and more a matter of opinion that's true there's a new genre called sex trance

1204
02:40:45,180 --> 02:40:51,660
or hexed trance that's very nightcore-esque and I love it that sounds so that name sounds so tiktok

1205
02:40:52,140 --> 02:40:55,420
sex trance that sounds like a word that was made up on tiktok

1206
02:40:59,020 --> 02:41:03,580
I'm I OMG she doesn't know gas gas gas is a very iconic song

1207
02:41:05,180 --> 02:41:11,260
just listen to gas gas gas someone red pill her on an initial deep what

1208
02:41:12,220 --> 02:41:19,020
my phone's gonna die soon so five percent sorry I'm covering up my camera gas gas gas

1209
02:41:21,980 --> 02:41:28,140
manual gas gas gas Manuel is a manual manual oh my god I'm sorry

1210
02:41:30,460 --> 02:41:39,260
Manuel um is this it I'm listening on my phone hold on is this it

1211
02:41:39,980 --> 02:41:49,180
is this it yes

1212
02:41:52,540 --> 02:41:54,460
it just sounds like an anime opening

1213
02:41:58,860 --> 02:42:00,860
yeah it just sounds like an anime opening

1214
02:42:09,980 --> 02:42:25,180
ha ha skip to the chorus where when's the chorus

1215
02:42:30,860 --> 02:42:35,180
sorry

1216
02:42:39,420 --> 02:42:54,620
the lyrics are so literal and like Taylor Swiftie I'm gonna step on the gas oh DMCA

1217
02:42:55,820 --> 02:43:03,020
oops oops oops I forgot I know you could hear it I didn't think about DMCA

1218
02:43:03,020 --> 02:43:07,740
sorry I'm too used to never getting strikes I might have to cut that part out of the stream

1219
02:43:07,820 --> 02:43:13,020
I might have to cut that part out of the stream sorry sorry sorry sorry

1220
02:43:19,340 --> 02:43:19,820
sorry

1221
02:43:24,860 --> 02:43:30,860
yeah I I I completely forgot I forget sometimes oopsie poopsie

1222
02:43:30,860 --> 02:43:33,980
oopsie doopsie

1223
02:43:39,740 --> 02:43:43,980
yes it's your fault you told me about gas gas gas it's your fault

1224
02:43:48,620 --> 02:43:53,980
um lyrics written by people who whose English is definitely not their first language I can

1225
02:43:53,980 --> 02:43:58,140
tell I'm gonna step on the gas of my car

1226
02:44:01,820 --> 02:44:08,060
do you like my car your beat was huge in japan at the time that makes sense probably because

1227
02:44:08,060 --> 02:44:09,420
the lyrics are super simple

1228
02:44:16,220 --> 02:44:23,580
don't be sorry pimpels just have strike PTSD that's fair I'm sorry can you sign sing that next

1229
02:44:23,740 --> 02:44:31,180
karaoke stream I I'm kind of uncomfortable with singing songs that I'm not familiar with

1230
02:44:32,060 --> 02:44:35,740
so I'd probably have to listen to that song over and over again and I'm not gonna lie that song

1231
02:44:35,740 --> 02:44:44,460
sounds really annoying I do I am planning songs for another karaoke stream um I want to do a

1232
02:44:44,460 --> 02:44:52,060
stream where I practice like uh deeper songs so like I have my playlist here hold on

1233
02:44:54,460 --> 02:45:01,420
because I feel like I sound better like that like at least it's easier for me so like um

1234
02:45:01,420 --> 02:45:07,420
rises the moon by is it liana flores or like from the start by lafi because people wanted

1235
02:45:07,420 --> 02:45:13,020
me to sing that while not drunk um washing machine heart by mitzky lots of mitzky songs

1236
02:45:13,980 --> 02:45:22,940
um stuff like that um the song from semen universe I don't know is that cringe

1237
02:45:22,940 --> 02:45:30,700
probably a little bit probably a little bit I'm more a lot more lafi songs is it lafi or lafi

1238
02:45:30,700 --> 02:45:38,460
lafi lafi I don't know but I want to sing songs sung by women with slightly deeper voices

1239
02:45:39,420 --> 02:45:41,820
um because that's like my comfortable range

1240
02:45:46,140 --> 02:45:49,980
some songs from le miserable would be awesome maybe

1241
02:45:54,380 --> 02:46:00,780
lofi no la lafi like the artist just saw the stream title is your mom still keeping you at

1242
02:46:00,780 --> 02:46:06,940
gunpoint yes she's always doing that from the start was amazing in the drunk karaoke I can't

1243
02:46:06,940 --> 02:46:13,500
imagine how good it would be when you aren't drunk I hope it would be better I hope it's better I hope

1244
02:46:13,500 --> 02:46:22,460
so I hope so I hope it's better I think it will be I think it will be maybe not that much better

1245
02:46:22,460 --> 02:46:29,100
but I think a little bit better at least I hope I don't know I I pause I actually don't hear my I

1246
02:46:29,100 --> 02:46:35,100
try not I try to avoid recording myself while singing because um that's cringe to hear but

1247
02:46:35,340 --> 02:46:41,500
um I didn't want to show you something because strani sent it to me earlier so I wanted to show

1248
02:46:41,500 --> 02:46:51,420
you remember how I gave you a um I gave you a uh a sneak peek at one of my song covers I wanted

1249
02:46:51,420 --> 02:46:57,980
to give you another sneak peek because it's not done yet the mix isn't done yet but it's like

1250
02:46:57,980 --> 02:47:03,580

1252
02:47:11,740 --> 02:47:20,780
sneak peek the four night battle pass one uh just got sent over to be um like made into an MV I guess

1253
02:47:20,780 --> 02:47:30,060
so I don't know how long that'll take but hopefully it won't take long um maybe like

1254
02:47:30,460 --> 02:47:37,100
do what to myself k y s by bo bernum by bo bernum the song

1255
02:47:39,980 --> 02:47:44,380
I feel like I should show you uh you listen let you listen to like a little bit longer version

1256
02:47:44,380 --> 02:47:52,220
than like just two seconds like last time um maybe like 10 seconds hold on I have to pause

1257
02:47:52,220 --> 02:47:59,100
it real quick or no I have to download it first I don't know it's 10 seconds too long you still

1258
02:47:59,100 --> 02:48:02,700
gotta I still gotta you know I still gotta tease you a little bit

1259
02:48:07,420 --> 02:48:13,420
what about the filthy frank one of the same name I could I don't know I'm I could do more meme songs

1260
02:48:13,420 --> 02:48:17,180
maybe if these ones do good at least I might do more but I don't think they'll do good

1261
02:48:17,180 --> 02:48:22,220
don't tell sturdy I said that I just feel like song covers in general don't get that popular

1262
02:48:22,220 --> 02:48:28,220
um unless they're like parody songs and maybe but I feel like song covers in general don't

1263
02:48:28,300 --> 02:48:32,620
don't get that popular unless you're already a big vtuber then they will get popular but if you're

1264
02:48:32,620 --> 02:48:36,380
not then I feel like they don't get that popular I don't know it's just me though it's just me

1265
02:48:36,380 --> 02:48:43,340
being a doomer and a pessimist um you know it's just me being pessimistic oh no my face is bad

1266
02:48:45,900 --> 02:48:53,180
damn it you heard it why is my face bad so low okay you heard a little bit no okay

1267
02:48:53,900 --> 02:48:54,400
okay

1268
02:48:56,220 --> 02:49:01,820
it's maybe I should turn down the echo more and I feel like it's very echoey um clip it

1269
02:49:06,620 --> 02:49:12,460
um I'll I'll give you I'll give you I get it I don't usually like covers I'm okay with

1270
02:49:12,460 --> 02:49:20,140
listening to covers sung by vtubers but I um I just feel like I don't know they don't they

1271
02:49:20,220 --> 02:49:26,540
don't get traction which is fine they're fun to do for people who like to sing so you know

1272
02:49:27,980 --> 02:49:35,900
okay I'll give you a 10 second 10 second little little a clip have you ever felt sad or lonely

1273
02:49:35,900 --> 02:49:41,660
have you ever felt two feet tall have you ever thought man if only how is anybody else at all

1274
02:49:42,540 --> 02:49:48,460
they like to kick okay that's it that's it that's it that's it that's it that's all you get

1275
02:49:50,300 --> 02:49:51,260
did you like it

1276
02:49:55,500 --> 02:50:00,780
that's that's it's not done but um that's a little bit of it

1277
02:50:07,900 --> 02:50:14,060
sounds really cute thank you honestly the mixers always do a good job of making me sound um

1278
02:50:15,020 --> 02:50:20,620
it's listenable listenable I need it on loop

1279
02:50:22,860 --> 02:50:26,780
you can have it on loop when it comes out I don't know when that will be but

1280
02:50:30,700 --> 02:50:36,460
it's out of my hands so I don't know when it will come out but hopefully soon I don't know a month

1281
02:50:37,180 --> 02:50:39,660
why don't have four DMs who's DMing me

1282
02:50:50,460 --> 02:50:56,620
sorry I know my model is sleeping because I'm sitting on the floor so I have to look all the

1283
02:50:56,620 --> 02:51:03,500
way up to see my monitors thank you for coming up in pal honestly it's impressive to me how you

1284
02:51:03,500 --> 02:51:06,940
well you can sing even when you're singing at a hard pitch then you're more comfortable

1285
02:51:07,820 --> 02:51:14,940
it's impressive to me too because it's really fucking hard like talking like this is fine and I

1286
02:51:14,940 --> 02:51:23,660
I'm comfortable um but singing is like completely different I I uh I have to position my like

1287
02:51:24,860 --> 02:51:32,620
throat I guess in like a completely different way um and it's it's it's kind of uncomfortable

1288
02:51:32,620 --> 02:51:41,900
and it's not um it's not sustainable for me for like karaoke's um or just casual singing I I like

1289
02:51:41,900 --> 02:51:48,860
it's it's hard it's really hard um so you think it'd be easy you would think it'd be like chill

1290
02:51:48,860 --> 02:52:00,460
but no it's it's really hard actually drama plus fired plus mom me fired what do you mean

1291
02:52:01,420 --> 02:52:03,820
in me of the floor what's your wisdom um

1292
02:52:08,140 --> 02:52:09,500
I'm not a wise person

1293
02:52:12,140 --> 02:52:15,340
uh I'm not a wise person at all

1294
02:52:21,660 --> 02:52:22,140
um

1295
02:52:25,740 --> 02:52:28,300
if you're uh

1296
02:52:30,700 --> 02:52:40,540
I don't take don't let other people take pictures of you because it will they will make you look

1297
02:52:40,540 --> 02:52:46,940
really ugly and self-conscious uh don't let other people take pictures of you that's my

1298
02:52:46,940 --> 02:52:53,420
wisdom you'll you'll you'll be like wow this looks awful especially your mom but anyone in general

1299
02:52:53,420 --> 02:53:00,060
you should be in control of your own pictures because otherwise you're gonna look bad there you

1300
02:53:00,700 --> 02:53:01,260
go

1301
02:53:04,300 --> 02:53:09,500
wisdom kiss your sister kiss your sister too that's my wisdom that's my wisdom

1302
02:53:13,900 --> 02:53:18,700
that's fair never looked good in pictures never look you it's very normal to not look good in

1303
02:53:18,700 --> 02:53:23,260
pictures that other people take of you because it's like they don't know they don't know what

1304
02:53:23,260 --> 02:53:27,820
makes you look good you know they don't know your angles they don't know I don't know they don't

1305
02:53:28,300 --> 02:53:32,540
you know they don't know how to make you look good they just take the picture you know yeah

1306
02:53:34,860 --> 02:53:39,580
but you took good pics of your cousins right of your cousin I did take good pictures of my cousin

1307
02:53:39,580 --> 02:53:47,020
because um she like I said she kind of just looks like a model naturally I didn't I didn't have to

1308
02:53:47,020 --> 02:53:51,660
try too hard to make her look good I wasn't like posing her she already knew what to do she's she's

1309
02:53:51,660 --> 02:53:59,020
very uh you know she's she's like she's got that model look you know I don't even know what

1310
02:53:59,020 --> 02:54:05,340
makes me look good that's okay too but your people who take pictures of you will like make you look

1311
02:54:05,340 --> 02:54:17,100
even worse only let me take pictures of you I'll make you look good yes especially for ID and driving

1312
02:54:17,660 --> 02:54:26,380
driving license pictures oh my god I look awful I look so awful I've had people do double takes

1313
02:54:26,380 --> 02:54:34,940
at my ID because I don't look like that in real life like in real life I look so much different

1314
02:54:34,940 --> 02:54:42,460
than my ID and my idea I look like a fucking I look like a I look like a kappa I look like a kappa

1315
02:54:42,460 --> 02:54:49,020
that just crawled out from under a bridge but in real life I don't look like that it's just

1316
02:54:49,820 --> 02:54:55,500
it looks bad because someone else took the picture and also I was like not really ready to take a

1317
02:54:55,500 --> 02:55:01,980
picture that day I wasn't I wasn't planning on taking a picture I wish we lived in I wish like

1318
02:55:01,980 --> 02:55:08,140
more governments were nice about taking pictures of you for your ID because like in Korea they let

1319
02:55:08,140 --> 02:55:13,660
you fucking photoshop your ID did you know that why would they do that why would they do that here

1320
02:55:13,660 --> 02:55:19,980
in Canada you can't even smile you're not allowed to smile you're not allowed to wear like I think

1321
02:55:19,980 --> 02:55:25,820
you're not allowed to wear like a lot of makeup I'm not quite sure but um like in Korea they have

1322
02:55:25,820 --> 02:55:32,860
like professional photo booths that will make you look beautiful and and and photoshop you into

1323
02:55:32,860 --> 02:55:37,180
looking sorry I know I'm liking a little bit photoshopping you into looking beautiful here it's

1324
02:55:37,180 --> 02:55:42,540
like you go to the nearest shoppers and they like put you in front of the fucking chip aisle and take

1325
02:55:42,540 --> 02:55:51,340
a picture of you I'm taking a picture of you right there in the store like I'm sure they have

1326
02:55:51,340 --> 02:55:55,660
professional not professional but I'm sure they have better boots here but I feel like that's what

1327
02:55:56,060 --> 02:55:56,860
people

1328
02:56:01,020 --> 02:56:06,620
shoppers is a drug store by the way in Canada shoppers is a drug store here

1329
02:56:09,500 --> 02:56:13,820
yeah and they just take one there's like no redoes like they just they just take one

1330
02:56:14,380 --> 02:56:26,540
what's the point of an ID then I don't know I don't know my ID makes me look like a gangster

1331
02:56:29,420 --> 02:56:32,620
it really doesn't look like like your real self at all

1332
02:56:35,580 --> 02:56:39,580
shoppers does your driver's license CIBC does mine but shoppers did my passport

1333
02:56:39,580 --> 02:56:47,180
I think so I don't I think they can I think they can take any ID photos I'm not sure but yeah like

1334
02:56:49,660 --> 02:56:57,260
they they don't they don't they don't do you any favors at all yeah you only get one I said that

1335
02:56:57,260 --> 02:57:03,500
already I applied for a US visa and the requirements for the photo were insanely strict they are very

1336
02:57:03,500 --> 02:57:07,340
strict with photos yeah yeah you can't smile yeah

1337
02:57:09,820 --> 02:57:12,380
is to pretend that you're the person in the photo of course

1338
02:57:14,540 --> 02:57:20,060
look at a drug store issues passports not actual drugs but like a drug store like a convenience store

1339
02:57:20,940 --> 02:57:27,820
I don't know why they do that but they do I guess Immy Lord I know that because I used to work at one

1340
02:57:28,700 --> 02:57:34,700
I used to work at a shoppers and I would have people come in to take their ID photos

1341
02:57:36,700 --> 02:57:41,180
and I would feel bad for them because of course they always look like shit in those ID photos

1342
02:57:41,180 --> 02:57:43,420
okay I need I need to shut my yap

1343
