65
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,160

67
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:05,360
strani yeah that's possible

68
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,480
um

69
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:20,720
stay close get back in my face okay i'll get back in your face then i feel like you can

70
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,480
you can see everything up here you can see everything up close you can see how

71
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:34,400
i my ear disconnects so i i changed my rigging um for my hair i wanted it to be more flowy

72
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,360
because before it wasn't this flowy right so i changed it i changed the physics for my hair

73
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,560
to be more flowy but the problem is because i did that um when i turn too hard you can see

74
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,240
or even when i just turn you can see that my um my ear disconnects from my face

75
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:01,280
that's my own fault and then um i'm doing more it's almost done it might even be done before

76
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:08,800
the live 2d rigging stream i'm doing a little more and um that that that what i'm doing will

77
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:16,480
probably also add some more silly silly awkward um mistakes but that's okay it'll look cute it's okay

78
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:26,640
she cut her ear off her arms were cut off her legs were cut off her ears were cut off

79
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:34,400
her tongue was cut off and then they cooked her limbs in a pot and ate it i should actually keep

00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:40,000

thank you for the super chat big head it's not big it's just it just looks big because of

85
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,360
the camera okay there's a meme

86
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:24,400
because i like to watch true crime shows i like to watch true crime shows so um

87
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,680
this meme uh relates to me a lot i think this is the original

88
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,920
oh it's a fucking ad

89
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:40,800
oh i muted youtube no i didn't mute youtube what

90
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,840
oh there we go here i'll show you show it to you

91
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,160

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,120
how far does it open

94
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,560
there we go this is the meme

95
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,200
i hope it's loud enough her arms were cut off her legs were cut off her ears were cut off

96
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,600
her tongue was cut off her nose was cut off her eyeballs were blocked out

97
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,800
that would probably be your reaction to the true crime stuff i watch

98
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,320
another meme you're talking about i love it as someone who used to sleep to true crime in horror

121
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:23,440
i was worried about and i found out that it's not true and um it makes me happy

122
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:29,520
because i was really worried about something but it's it's in the end it worked out so that

123
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,160
makes me happy i can't tell you full details but i was really i was i was worried about something

124
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:43,040
but it turns out i didn't have to worry about it so that's nice and i like that and that's why

125
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,000
i'm happy today i can't tell you

126
00:17:51,920 --> 00:18:00,080
how about this maybe one day in like six months you'll learn what i was happy about there

127
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,080
weird al isn't real he can't hurt you and me i found out real al isn't actually real

128
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,920
i'm gonna wipe my glasses off real quick they feel really dirty

129
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,280
i feel like neuro someone would call you a ginger

130
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,520
what why why

131
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:35,920
huh i used to wear contact lenses when i was a flush tuber because the freaking glare from my um

132
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:45,120
me the freaking glare from my um my glasses on my ring like it used to be so bad that like

133
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,800
i couldn't even stream with my glasses on so i used to wear contact lenses i used to wear

134
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,480
like uh blue ones and gray ones those were my favorite colors because they the blue ones were

135
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,320
a nice contract contrast because i had pink hair and the gray ones just looked cool

136
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,880
as long as everything is okay and you're happy that's all we care about i am i am i am

137
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,000
let me forget about in six months well that's okay you might not even be here in six months

138
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,240
so that's okay like had a chromium no no no i just wear like like two contact lenses of the same color

139
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,160
i hate contacts it feels weird touching my eyes and

140
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,320
usually you're not supposed to feel them like at all you're not supposed to feel them at all

141
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,720
so you shouldn't be feeling your contact lenses like touching your eyes

142
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,440
how did you put them on versus remove them i thought about giving them a try but knowing

143
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,640
my clumsy self i don't want my eyeballs messed up your eyeballs your eyeballs are actually a

144
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:03,200
lot more sturdy than you think they are like they're not just gonna fall out you're not just

145
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,600
gonna scratch them that easily like your your your eyebrows can handle a rubbing okay you can

146
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:16,880
your eye your eyeballs can handle a little bit of um you know a little bit of touching a little bit of

147
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:26,480
messing around so it's okay don't be scared it doesn't hurt thank you for the 199 super chat

148
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,600
i'll always be here for my little sister oh i'll always be here for my big brother

151
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,840
i don't think about like collabing with a lot of people which is surprising because i've

152
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,400
collabed with a few people already but like in the past i never collabed with like anyone

153
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,320
because when i watch a streamer i usually like to just only watch that streamer

154
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,920

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,160
collabs are good for networking they are

158
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,440
um like i don't mind video collabs i think those are fun um but i'm just never someone that like

159
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,040
thinks about collabing with a bunch of people i don't have the strawney mindset i need to change

160
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,120
that i need to change that i need to get that that strawney mindset

161
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,080
collabs good but collabs all the time get tiring that's true too

162
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,800
oh yeah i want i remember what i wanted to check

163
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,400
oh my god we're only fucking

164
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,640
shit i can't do math let me let me let me get out the calculator

165
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:16,080

167
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,400
it took me and i'm very singly long to calculate that

168
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,880
yeah strawney consumes the other person after the collab absorbs their asmr skills too

169
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,160
oh shit i shouldn't do a collab with strawney then huh

170
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,960
well if it's with people my little sis likes to interact with well

171
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,040
i'm going to collab with someone i like to interact with of course of course

172
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,520
what do you mean i'm not gonna collab with someone i don't like

173
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,320
what are you afraid that we would like the other two more and that's a lot of you no no

174
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:22,560
no someone fucking i burp so much someone said i had good i literally i don't actually burp

175
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:28,160
that much when i'm alone i don't know what's wrong maybe it's because i'm drinking a lot on stream

176
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:35,360
because i do drink a lot more on stream than i do like um when i do like normally so maybe

177
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,720
the the amount of drinking is causing me to burp i don't know i i don't burp this much in real

178
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,760
life truly i don't or maybe it's the talking or maybe it's the nervous burps too i don't know

179
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,280
i really don't i think it might be the talking too i remember when i'm i remember when i call

lots of people were hoping you were flat it's very very hard to lots of people some people are

251
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,480
so strange and don't understand like like you think strawney asked for like fucking

252
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:38,800
pics when she hired us like what do you mean like you think that was part of her

253
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,080
hiring the character like when when she was hiring Azura do you think she she had the

254
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:52,000
requirement of being over 200 pounds like no of course not she's not asking us for body

255
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,840
pics to make sure we actually fit the characters why are you acting so gay

256
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,160
oh i have to read that uh i know this would be mean but i would love to know what the haters

257
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:07,200
say about vealer nature girls i love to laugh at all the guys wasting their time working about

258
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:17,040
vtubers i don't want to say it i don't want to say it it's really not that bad and it's really

259
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:27,920
not a lot fuck you you're seeing water uh okay fine i'll get water like you can probably you can

260
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:36,000
look yourself and see it's pretty easy to find it's pretty easy to find even on the smoothie clips

261
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,920
just go sort by newest and you'll find them yeah so uh are you as tall as a building

262
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:53,840
like no of course she did want to find like um she wanted to find like a black vtuber to fill

263
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,120
in Azura's role because that would be kind of awkward to like put a white girl as Azura but

264
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:06,720
like otherwise like otherwise you know she's not making sure we look like our freaking models

265
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,160
that's it's already hard enough to fill in a character you know it's hard enough to fill in

266
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:17,760
like someone that that you feel like fits in with what you're looking for and also has like

267
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,360
all the requirements that they were looking for too

00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:23,440
She's getting the water from the toilet.

285
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,920
She's reducing water to drink.

286
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:33,360

I'll turn off my background music.

296
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,560

300
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,840

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,280
Okay, we've been down here already.

314
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,720
I think we just first got down here when I started, right?

315
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,880
Remember we did tell you we love your rapping?

316
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,520
I guess that's true.

317
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,360
Thank you for liking my yapping.

318
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,960
When I was a kid, I was mostly quiet.

319
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,200
I never really yapped too much.

320
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,240
And then when I did yap, my mom would get annoyed.

321
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,920
Litter here.

322
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,360
Oh, litter stops here.

323
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,080
You can fix it.

324
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,160
What?

325
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:37,960
Re-recycle it.

326
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,760
Oh, that's cool.

327
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,260
Okay.

328
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,360
Can I see the character in the mirror here?

329
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,720
Or am I crazy?

330
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,400
I think I'm going crazy.

331
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,160
Ollie might be the goat?

332
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,040
The goat?

333
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,000
Like the goat is in like the greatest of all time?

334
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,080
That kind of goat?

335
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,040
Mom's not here yet, unless she is, which is weird.

336
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,280
Mom is not here.

337
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,360
I can yap as much as I want, now that mom is gone.

338
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,560
Yeah, I'm in debt.

339
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,560
Debt, debt.

340
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,000
I'm in debt for the yapping.

341
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,600
Is it just me, or do I see like, is it my monitor?

342
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,720
I see some glitches on my screen.

343
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,520
Do you see that?

344
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,640
Have you been seeing that?

345
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,120
Is that my monitor, or is that supposed to happen in game?

346
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,680
I do have really old monitors.

347
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,840
Bro, some people fucking hate the frilly stuff

348
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,320
I have on my monitors.

349
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,400
I think they're cute.

350
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,880
You don't see glitches?

351
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,960
Maybe I'll make a full screen.

352
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,680
I see some glitches on my screen.

353
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,480
Oh, come on.

354
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,840
Why does that do that?

355
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,480
Why does it do that?

356
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,440
Never mind, we're not going full screen.

357
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,560
Frills cause interference?

358
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,440
It's not the frills.

359
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,880
I see glitches on my screen, like TV glitches?

360
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,080
Like it goes up the screen, like that.

361
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,800
Do you see that?

362
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,600
Wait, holy shit.

363
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,240
Oh, you don't see it.

364
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,440
Wait.

365
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,560
Channan's compare on OBS.

366
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,520
OK, you don't see it.

367
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,120
It's just me.

368
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,640
OK, it must be my monitor.

369
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,120
I do have really old monitors.

370
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:54,240
When I was making my PC, no, we definitely don't see it.

371
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:54,960
OK, OK.

372
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,320
Tearing enable v-sync.

373
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,560
What the fuck is v-sync?

374
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,280
Have you tried turning it on and off again?

375
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,800
Tearing, v-sync.

376
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,760
Wait, what's v-sync?

377
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,720
What's v-sync?

378
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,040
What the fuck is v-sync?

379
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,880
Do you need to turn on v-sync?

380
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,680
Wait, what's v-sync?

381
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,480
A graphics option to fix tearing in settings.

382
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,200
Is it here?

383
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:18,680
Graphics?

384
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,520
Is it here?

385
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,760
Is it here?

386
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,720
A setting v-sync.

387
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,360
I mean, I mean, what?

388
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,960
What, I mean?

389
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,880
Yeah, I'm not a gamer.

390
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,880
I don't know.

391
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,320
No, this shows v-sync.

392
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,280
It's under display.

393
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:46,780
Oh.

394
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
So yes?

395
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,160
OK, I turned it on.

396
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:04,440
I have really old monitors, because when I, I think it's

397
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,640
fixed.

398
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:12,520
When I was buying my PC, I forgot that when you buy an

399
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,760
actual real computer, it only comes with a computer and

400
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,800
nothing else.

401
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
Like, it doesn't come with monitors.

402
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,440
It doesn't come with, like, what's it called?

403
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,920
What's it called?

404
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,560
No peripherals, peripherals.

405
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,160
Like, it doesn't come with speakers.

406
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,280
It doesn't come with speakers.

407
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,680
It doesn't come with monitors.

408
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,280
It just comes with the PC block, right?

409
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,760
And I completely forgot about that.

410
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,480
So when I finally saved up enough to buy a computer by

411
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,680
doing commissions, I forgot that it doesn't come with

412
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,520
peripherals.

413
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,000
So yeah, no keyboard, no mouse.

414
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:16,600
So I spent my entire, like, PC budget on the PC itself.

415
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,840
And then I was like, wait, I can't use it.

416
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,960
I can't use the PC.

417
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,080
I don't have anything to connect it to.

418
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,200
I forgot it's just a pewter, and it doesn't come

419
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,320
with the pewter parts.

420
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,640
What am I supposed to do here?

421
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,520
I feel like I'm going in a circle.

422
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,520
Help me.

423
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,960
Help me.

424
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,440
Yeah, it's a very fancy and heavy paperweight now.

425
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,440
You got to open the door if you want to progress.

426
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,880
This door?

427
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,880
This door?

428
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,280
A very fancy, heavy paperweight.

429
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:07,880
And so I went on Kijiji, which is, like,

430
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,920
Emmy What, which is, like, the Canadian Craigslist.

431
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:20,080
And I looked up, what other door is there by the big machine?

432
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,040
There's no door.

433
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,040
What door?

434
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,920
Something I've been having!

435
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,720
Other side?

436
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,480
There's no door.

437
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,800
You just looked at it.

438
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,880
Find the cage and open the door on it.

439
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,000
Oh, this door.

440
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,840
This isn't a fucking door.

441
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,480
Oh, it is a door.

442
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,480
OK.

443
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,000
OK.

444
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,240
Enter the gas production.

445
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,360
You've got the key.

446
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,280
Now the question you're probably asking yourself is,

447
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,520
where does it go?

448
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,480
Well, head back out, and you should find a door just

449
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,880
to the left of the cable car you took down here.

450
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:35,000
So I went on Kijiji, and I found, it's not this door, is it?

451
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,920
This is just a door hanging against the...

452
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,200
Am I supposed to find another door?

453
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:41,920
Back of the stairs.

454
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,600
Oh, right.

455
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,520
I didn't pay attention to what he was saying.

456
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,160
I'll be honest.

457
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,280
I kind of blacked out.

458
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,600
He said something about going left.

459
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,000
You're so quiet, Hopi Hopscotch.

460
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:58,800
Oh, wait.

461
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,400
I'm being stupid.

462
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,760
I can just turn my own sound up.

463
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,520
There we go.

464
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,160
OK, there we go.

465
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
OK, whatever.

466
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
No.

467
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
What about you?

468
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
She sounds like Fluttershy.

469
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Kind of.

470
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Hi, I'm CraftyCorn.

471
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Actually, it's more breathy.

472
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Pass me the blue please.

473
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Hi, you remember me.

474
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
OK.

475
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
That might be intentional.

476
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I mean, yeah, that makes sense as to why it would be intentional.

477
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
When are we getting MLP fanfic reading?

478
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I don't know.

479
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Oh, one day.

480
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I gotta finish my fucking story.

481
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yeah, I went on Kijiji, which is Canadian Craigslist,

482
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
and I found one monitor was free.

483
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I had to stand outside this guy's house

484
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
because he told me what time to come.

485
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Well, yeah, he told me what time to come at, right?

486
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
And so I get there at the right time.

487
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
He lives super far away from me.

488
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I get there at the right time, and I knock on his door.

489
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Why are you acting so gay?

490
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I love how little sister didn't apologize for yelling.

491
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Looks like we've got to bring back the shell color.

492
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
You weren't helping me.

493
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
It's fine for me to yell.

494
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It's fine.

495
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Where am I supposed to go?

496
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Do you know who the voice actress is?

497
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Is it Fluttershy's voice actress?

498
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
That'd be cool.

499
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I don't think so.

500
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
It doesn't sound like Fluttershy that much.

501
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
There's a door with red light you're looking for that.

502
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
There's a door with red light.

503
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I stand up.

504
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I knock on his door when I get there and nobody answers, right?

505
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And so he said that he'll have the monitor in his garage

506
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
and his garage door is open.

507
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:24,000
So I go into his garage and I look around and it's not there.

508
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
So then I just stand there like, what do I do now?

509
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Because I wanted this monitor but he didn't show up to our meeting time.

510
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So I just stand there for a little bit.

511
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Looking around, snooping in his garage.

512
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And finally I see a neighbor next door and I'm like,

513
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
hey, have you seen Blank's name?

514
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I was supposed to meet up with him and then the neighbor's like,

515
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
oh yeah, Blank went to go pick up his kids from school and I'm like,

516
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
huh?

517
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
And he's like, but his wife should be in the house.

518
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Like his wife should be home and I'm like, oh, okay.

519
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So I go back.

520
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
You make it so easy to begin.

521
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I needed that freaking monitor, man.

522
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Free monitors sound super sketchy.

523
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
It was not sketchy.

524
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
This monitor is so old.

525
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
It's right next to the Playhouse to me.

526
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Playhouse.

527
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Which one is the Playhouse?

528
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Hold on, there was a map, wasn't there?

529
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
There was a map.

530
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Is this the map?

531
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
No.

532
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And so I go knock on his door again and his wife doesn't answer me.

533
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
So I literally stand there for like 30 minutes.

534
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:59,000
And finally he gets home from picking up his kids, the billboard.

535
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
It was right in front of her.

536
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
The billboard is the map?

537
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Oh, the billboard is the map.

538
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Playhouse.

539
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
You said it was in front of the Playhouse?

540
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Where am I?

541
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Oh, this is the Playhouse.

542
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Or next to the Playhouse you said it was?

543
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
The left of the stairs you took coming in.

544
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Coming in?

545
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Which stairs did I take coming in?

546
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Oh, there's a red light over there.

547
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Oh, wow, this thing keeps going.

548
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Finally he gets home from bringing his kids back from school.

549
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And I'm like, hey, remember me?

550
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
You were supposed to give me a free monitor that you put up on Kijiji.

551
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And he's like, oh yeah, sure, I'll get it for you.

552
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And then he goes into his frickin' house.

553
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
He goes into his house and brings back the monitor.

554
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
It wasn't even in his frickin' garage.

555
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I snooped through his garage for nothing.

556
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
The dog day is so bad.

557
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
What does that mean?

558
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
That's the thing.

559
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Why did the wife not answer the door?

560
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Because she was home.

561
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I saw her.

562
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
She was home.

563
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
And she didn't answer.

564
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And it's not like I'm some fucking creepy stranger.

565
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I'm just a girl.

566
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I'm not going to, you know, I'm just a girl.

567
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I'm not going to break into the house.

568
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I'm just here for the monitor your husband put up on Kijiji.

569
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Don't forget your mask.

570
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Watch your step.

571
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
False?

572
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
She probably thought you were a solicitor.

573
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
The beating heart of the whole evil play care system.

574
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
All that gas you see coming from the machine is made right here in the factory.

575
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
It's called the red smoke.

576
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Right now, it's all headed off to the right.

577
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
We need to make that red smoke go left instead.

578
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
That's how we can get to him.

579
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
The machine will probably have a few dumb safeguards for you to work around.

580
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
But I think you can do it.

581
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Sorry, I'm fitting myself off with my shirt.

582
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Ten hour puzzle.

583
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
You're a possible home wrecker.

584
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I hope not.

585
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
That would be, that would be concerning for her husband.

586
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Didn't you commit high treason?

587
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
What?

588
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Me?

589
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
No.

590
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Just take the shirt off.

591
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Stop trying to get me to play games naked.

592
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Um.

593
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Okay, no power.

594
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Okay, first steps first.

595
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Get power.

596
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Probably by putting power stuff in here.

597
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Right?

598
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Isn't it more fun that way?

599
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
No, not really.

600
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Uh, no.

601
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Do not enter.

602
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Let me in.

603
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Let me go in.

604
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Let me enter.

605
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You're in your own home.

606
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
It can't hurt to wear a bit less.

607
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Um.

608
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I don't know.

609
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I like wearing clothes.

610
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Like I even like, I don't know.

611
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Do you guys wear underwear when you go to sleep?

612
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I know some people do and some people don't.

613
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I like to wear underwear in my sleep.

614
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Oh, sleigh.

615
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I just said sleigh.

616
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
That was kind of cringe.

617
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Oh, chat is gone.

618
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

619
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Yes, some people don't.

620
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Some people don't wear underwear in their sleep.

621
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Like my mom doesn't wear underwear in her sleep.

622
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
But she always like, she's always like,

623
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I don't wear underwear in your sleep.

624
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Like when I was younger,

625
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,000
she didn't put underwear on me to go to sleep.

626
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
A free monitor.

627
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
You found it in an online listing far away from your house.

628
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
The guy's in there known as answering the door.

629
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000
You said, you said it like this sounds sketchy as fuck.

630
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
It was in a nice neighborhood.

631
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Okay.

632
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
It was in a nice neighborhood.

633
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
It was in a cute safe neighborhood.

634
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
There was literally a school like right next door

635
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
with a bunch of kids playing over there.

636
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Like I'm not going like fucking into the countryside

637
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
to get this monitor.

638
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I'm not like driving two hours away just for a shitty monitor.

639
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Why do you not?

640
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I don't know.

641
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I don't know why she doesn't.

642
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Doesn't the fabric drive you insane?

643
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:29,000
No, it doesn't.

644
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Extended wire links.

645
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Swapping hands is easy.

646
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Why is this such a shitty screen?

647
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Air jets.

648
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
The countryside is safe?

649
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Cities are the danger?

650
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I don't know.

651
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
It was a nice family neighborhood.

652
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I thought it was fine.

653
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
But I guess that's what they all think, right?

654
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And then they get kidnapped and they get cut into pieces

655
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
and cannibalized and cooked and stuffed in the fridge

656
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
and buried in the backyard.

657
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And they get their tongues cut off.

658
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And their legs cut off.

659
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
And their arms cut off.

660
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And their ears cut off.

661
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,000
And then they get flushed down the toilet.

662
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Okay, that was something about the jet pack.

663
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Oh, I got it!

664
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Press two or scroll to swap hands.

665
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Ooh!

666
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Wait, but this isn't the jet pack.

667
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
What is this?

668
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
What does this one do?

669
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Can we watch shitty analog horror one day?

670
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Sure, if you want to.

671
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:45,000
No.

672
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Purple head makes you jump.

673
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:58,000
How do I jump?

674
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Oh, and falling.

675
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,000
No.

676
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Why is there your hand here?

677
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Oh!

678
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Whoa!

679
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Oh, it didn't...

680
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Do your best?

681
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
What do you mean do my best?

682
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I'm always doing my best.

683
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Purple hand pads.

684
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Okay, yeah, I figured that out.

685
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Am I doing good?

686
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Am I getting further?

687
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Jet pack deploys and explains where your legs don't snap.

688
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Okay, okay.

689
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Can I climb up these?

690
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
No.

691
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
You're doing very good.

692
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Ah, she's such a gamer.

693
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I wish I had a controller.

694
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I feel like I'd be more comfortable playing with a controller,

695
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
but I only have Wii controllers.

696
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I don't have Xbox controllers.

697
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Should I get an Xbox controller?

698
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Because Xbox controllers work with...

699
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Why is there just a circle here?

700
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Is it for stupid people like me and to confuse them?

701
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
It works with windows, right?

702
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I don't know if it's true.

703
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Is it true?

704
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Ah!

705
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Oh.

706
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:34,000
It's like...

707
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I got a 230 inch ultra wide that I don't use,

708
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
but I learned the Caribbean.

709
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I'll send you the ticket.

710
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Chill.

711
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I live in a nice neighborhood.

712
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I don't need your monitors.

713
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I have mine now.

714
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I'm not really a fancy monitor person.

715
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I don't really care about fancy monitors.

716
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I got the ones that were the cheapest ones,

717
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
because like I said, I spent all of my budget on the PC itself.

718
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
So I use an Acer one.

719
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
What's the other one?

720
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I covered it with stickers.

721
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I don't actually know what brand it is.

722
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Does that say...

723
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I think it's Asus.

724
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I think people are gonna shit on me for my pronunciation of Asus.

725
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Is it Asus?

726
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:45,000
It's broke.

727
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Read somewhere if a game has the label for Microsoft Windows.

728
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
It has the native support for Xbox controller.

729
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Okay.

730
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I'll try to get it exposed.

731
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Wait.

732
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Whoa.

733
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Red water.

734
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Why is it red?

735
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I'll try to get it.

736
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Oh, no.

737
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I can't make that jump.

738
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I can't make that jump.

739
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Ah, shit.

740
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Ah, that was close.

741
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Okay.

742
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Is this a C-bussy monitor Asus?

743
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
A switch controller should work as well.

744
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
No way.

745
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
No way it does.

746
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Does it actually?

747
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I do have a switch one.

748
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I feel like I'd be more comfortable leaning back.

749
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I have to, like...

750
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Where am I supposed to go from here?

751
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I have to, like, crouch over like a shrimp.

752
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
A switch pro controller should absolutely work.

753
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Oh, I don't know if mine is switch pro.

754
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Well, let me look up what a switch pro controller looks like.

755
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I don't actually know what a switch pro controller is.

756
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Switch pro controller?

757
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Oh, I think I have one of those.

758
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Yeah, I have that.

759
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:22,000
A switch has less support for games, but it does.

760
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I have a central column pulled down.

761
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Do I need to jump to the platform that is there?

762
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Central column.

763
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Central column.

764
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Central column.

765
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
There's a central column.

766
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Put a nice Xbox Series X controller down.

767
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Wait, so how do I get up here?

768
01:03:52,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Do I have to parkour this shit?

769
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:14,000
It doesn't want to get pulled down.

770
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Oh, it doesn't want to get pulled down.

771
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Now what?

772
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Now jump?

773
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I'm not going to make it.

774
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I'm not going to make it.

775
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
What do I run in this game?

776
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
It's shift, right?

777
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
There's a pipe to the left?

778
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:49,000
What, am I supposed to do something with it?

779
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Dude, I'm not going to make that.

780
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Jump on the pipe to the left.

781
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Oh.

782
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Oh.

783
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And then do I...

784
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Oh, I'm not going to make that either.

785
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I knew I wasn't going to make it.

786
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Buy once, cry once.

787
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Get an Xbox Elite controller into your set.

788
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I don't know what that means.

789
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Buy once, cry once?

790
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
What?

791
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Oh, okay.

792
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Okay.

793
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
There we go.

794
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Okay.

795
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:55,000
We're going to talk to gas.

796
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Oops, I accidentally switched.

797
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Am I supposed to crawl underneath here?

798
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Huh?

799
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Oh, jump over it.

800
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Okay.

801
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
There we go.

802
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Thank you.

803
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Thank you, thank you.

804
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Another one.

805
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Ding, ding, ah.

806
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Oh, fuck, this fucking button.

807
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Get you a Sanrio Xbox controller.

808
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Are there Sanrio Xbox controllers?

809
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I would really like that.

810
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Buy once, cry once.

811
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Refers to buy it once expensive and make sure it's high quality or else you'll buy it again

812
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
because the first time it was just a cheap scam.

813
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Oh.

814
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I don't know about that.

815
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Because for me, it's buy once, cry a lot because your rats chewed on it and now it's broken

816
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
and you have to buy it again.

817
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:27,000
That's how it is for me.

818
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
And don't talk to me about, oh, just hide it from your rats.

819
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Oh, just put it in another room.

820
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Shut up.

821
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
You don't know how it is.

822
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
They will literally escape my room.

823
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:52,000
They will escape my room while I'm literally walking out of it.

824
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Yeah, nothing can be hidden from the rats.

825
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Oh, by cord protectors, I do.

826
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And they chew through the cord protectors.

827
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Okay.

828
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Yeah, there's no hiding anything from Esteban.

829
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,000
She'll find it all.

830
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
At least they're cute though.

831
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Yeah, I forgive them because they're cute.

832
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
My guy's never seen pinky in the brain.

833
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Uh-uh, I don't know what that is.

834
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Uh-uh.

835
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,000
What?

836
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Just got here, what are the rats chewing through everything that I own?

837
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple are pretty chill about customer service.

838
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
It depends.

839
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:13,000
They'll probably ban me after a couple of times.

840
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
What are you going to do to a brain?

841
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Nothing.

842
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:21,000
What?

843
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
It's about two lab rats.

844
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
One is a doofus and the other wants to conquer the world.

845
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Oh, one is the brain and the other is insane.

846
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Oh, I never watched that.

847
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
No.

848
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Oh.

849
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I should turn these.

850
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Why won't it turn?

851
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
What?

852
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Am I doing it wrong?

853
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Why won't it turn?

854
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Is it really that bad when owning rats or just exaggerating?

855
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
No, it's not bad.

856
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
They will chew on everything.

857
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
They will chew on your clothes.

858
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Any time you hang out with them, they'll chew on you, on your clothes.

859
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
It's not bad though.

860
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I have nothing.

861
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I'm complaining, but I still love them a lot and it's, I'm not, I'm not mad about it.

862
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I know how to sew, so it's okay.

863
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
What's, what am I doing wrong?

864
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Oh, Q and E.

865
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
That's it, right?

866
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Sorry about the dog downstairs.

867
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:46,000
That's supposed to be it, right?

868
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:53,000
And then, and then the other one too.

869
01:10:53,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And then this one goes to, wait, where does this one go to?

870
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Do the rats shed hair everywhere like dogs and cats do?

871
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
A little bit, just a little bit.

872
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
It's not a lot.

873
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Rats are known to chew through phone lines for company offices, so yeah, it's no exaggeration.

874
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:29,000
My mom had rats in her backyard because her boyfriend wouldn't stop putting bird food out in the backyard and that would attract rats too.

875
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And so they chewed on her, I think they chewed on her air conditioning wires and she had to get those replaced.

876
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Like they chew on everything.

877
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
You should bark back.

878
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
No.

879
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I don't have a dog, it's my neighbor's dog, I don't have a dog.

880
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:58,000
They were really cool rats though, they were really big.

881
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:04,000
It goes to the post you moved around.

882
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Like that?

883
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Oh, thank you, okay.

884
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Did you take care of those rats?

885
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:25,000
No, no I did not, they were not, they were not my responsibility, I did not, I did not take care of them.

886
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
There's a theory that can kill the Rosariver.

887
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I was crazy once, they locked me in a room, the sisters room, a sister room filled with Emmy, and Emmy makes me crazy.

888
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Emmy makes you get crazy, she shouldn't make you crazy.

889
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:49,000
The roles are reversed from what the show makes you think, with the brain being the insane one, Pinky being the genius, playing dumb, huh?

890
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I haven't watched it so I don't know.

891
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I don't know anything about Pinky and the brain.

892
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Is that all I have to do in here?

893
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I need to get on top of the cage behind you to start the electricity.

894
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:33,000
On top.

895
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Oh.

896
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Let's go, thank you, did I do it?

897
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Was that it?

898
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Did I do it?

899
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Did it work?

900
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
This is blue now.

901
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
It worked, it's blue now.

902
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Okay.

903
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:06,000
And then, and then, and then what?

904
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:13,000
You need more power.

905
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Good girl.

906
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Thank you.

907
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Um, okay.

908
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Do I...

909
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Do I do this?

910
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Like that?

911
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
No, is that not it?

912
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Moving the posts around.

913
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Okay.

914
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Oh, that was close.

915
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Okay.

916
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Oops, what the fuck?

917
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Okay.

918
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Um, oh wait, is it?

919
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Ah, that was close too.

920
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Like that?

921
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Wait, like this?

922
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Yeah, I figured it out.

923
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Okay, and then I open the door too.

924
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
No, it didn't open the door.

925
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Come on!

926
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Oh, it did open the door.

927
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, we're getting progress done, and now this blue one.

928
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Did I already go through here?

929
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I did.

930
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I'm so smart!

931
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I'm so smart.

932
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
What am I even doing playing this game?

933
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I should be playing like, brain games.

934
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Are you smarter than a 5th grader?

935
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I wanted to play Are You Smarter Than a 5th grader on stream, but the game has really bad reviews, so I was like, I probably shouldn't.

936
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Does anything work now?

937
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
No.

938
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Who was the big machine in Twistle ever?

939
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:20,000
You mean the button?

940
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:27,000
The lever?

941
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Show us how you play factorial.

942
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
What's factorial?

943
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Brain age would be fun on stream.

944
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I had that game on the DS, and I would play it all the time.

945
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I would always tell me, because I was like a little kid when I had that game, and it always told me that my brain was really old.

946
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Where does this one go?

947
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I'm hearing scary sounds and it's scaring me.

948
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Wait, I'm getting scared. What does that sound?

949
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Oh my god!

950
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Oh no! Someone killed the path!

951
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Okay, I sent you another key. It's under the statue. Use it to get into Home Sweet Home.

952
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Then once you're inside, find the building's backup generator. Good luck!

953
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Okay, key under the statue. Use it to something about Home Sweet Home.

954
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
How do I leave? How do I leave here?

955
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Key under the statue, something about Home Sweet Home.

956
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Your Uber's here?

957
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Your Uber's here! Get in!

958
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I didn't order an Uber!

959
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Well, how's it go? I don't care!

960
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
That's the way? Okay.

961
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Am I getting a loading screen?

962
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
What?

963
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Are we gonna go through like a chase scene or something now?

964
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Uh oh. Ah, this is scary!

965
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:21,000
All he sounds like Dora? I don't think he does. I don't think he does.

966
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Wait, I already forgot what he said! What did he say?

967
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Oh my god, I almost spilled my water.

968
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Key under the statue, right? Key under the statue? Home Sweet Home.

969
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Is this the statue he's talking about?

970
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
What statue?

971
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:47,000
In the center building. This one, this one, okay.

972
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Oh, I don't like when it saves and makes me scared.

973
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Who's pissing in here?

974
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Uh...

975
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Why am I hearing sounds?

976
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Key under the statue?

977
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Oh look!

978
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Was this always this destroyed? Someone broke this!

979
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:34,000
It was the cat, wasn't it?

980
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:40,000
The cage you opened before.

981
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Oh, another one.

982
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Restore power in Home Sweet Home. Okay.

983
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:55,000
The monster's pissing?

984
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I'm kinda scared.

985
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
It's pretty though, they have stars.

986
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
That was the sound of the key arriving, I hope so.

987
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Okay.

988
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I'm actually kinda scared of the dark.

989
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I used to always sleep with a nightlight, cause I'm scared of the dark.

990
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And now I have those frickin' TikTok LEDs in my room, so I don't need a nightlight anymore.

991
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
But every time I would go to sleepovers with my best friends...

992
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Home Sweet Home. Home Sweet Home.

993
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Every time I would go to sleepovers with my best friends, they didn't like the light,

994
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
and they would be like, turn off the light, I can't fucking sleep!

995
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:44,000
And so I would have to sleep with no nightlight, and I was always so scared being in the complete darkness.

996
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Um...

997
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
At least there's lights here.

998
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
I'm gonna get... I'm gonna get...

999
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I'm gonna get... I'm gonna get lost.

1000
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Did I just go in a fucking circle?!

1001
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Home Sweet Home. Home Sweet Home. Home Sweet Home.

1002
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
This is Home Sweet Home, right?

1003
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Or no, this is Home Sweet Home.

1004
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Which one's Home Sweet Home?

1005
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
The front of the house is glowing red.

1006
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Is it that one?

1007
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Neither of them are Home Sweet Home!

1008
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
This one looks like it's glowing.

1009
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Road closed.

1010
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Is this house... Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1011
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Is anyone home?

1012
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
I'm looking through your windows!

1013
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
That's the thing I kind of like to do.

1014
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I used to work really, not really late at night, but I used to work until closing a lot.

1015
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
And so anytime I would walk home alone, I would like look through people's windows,

1016
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
because no one would close their blinds at night.

1017
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
And it was nice, because it was like, damn, your house looks so cozy.

1018
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I didn't do it in like a creepy way, like, ooh, I'm gonna break into your house.

1019
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I just kind of did it in like a... a curious way.

1020
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,000
And sometimes it would be awkward, because then like people would be in their house,

1021
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
and they would look outside, and they would see me...

1022
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,000
I wouldn't like stare and like stand into their back yard and stare,

1023
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,000
but like they would see me walking by and like looking at them, and that was awkward sometimes.

1024
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I also like to stare at people's porches, like they're friend of the houses,

1025
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,000
and sometimes people are on their porches, and sometimes they stare back, and that's awkward too.

1026
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Oh, there's people here.

1027
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
There's like real pictures of people here.

1028
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Is this the door?

1029
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Oh look, it's the pillow of the cat.

1030
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Not in a creepy way standing on the sidewalk outside of your house, watching your TV.

1031
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I wouldn't watch their TV.

1032
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Oh dude, something...

1033
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Am I gonna die?

1034
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Oh my god!

1035
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Am I gonna die?

1036
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Ah! Oh my god!

1037
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Nothing happened.

1038
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Check the drapes you can see, the drapes are also puppy playtime approved.

1039
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Oh, that's cool.

1040
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000

1041
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
How's your poison resistance?

1042
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Wait, am I gonna die if I stay here too long?

1043
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Run, run, run, run, run, run!

1044
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I mean, not even getting scared at the actual jump scares?

1045
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Wait, well there hasn't been an actual jump scare yet.

1046
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Am I supposed to go in one of these?

1047
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
There's no puzzles here, just keep moving forward.

1048
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Okay.

1049
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Catnip box through.

1050
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Do you hear that?

1051
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Is this radio?

1052
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Wait, where did my, where did my hands go?

1053
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Happy, happy and fun way, way?

1054
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Happy and fun way, was it love?

1055
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
What?

1056
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Happy and...

1057
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Fuck, I really need to pee.

1058
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Happy and fun way, was it love?

1059
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
What does that mean?

1060
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
No, cause you put the volume to like 30.

1061
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Don't go yet?

1062
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Shut up.

1063
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
We're not doing that right now.

1064
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I'm gonna go this way.

1065
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
What does that say?

1066
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Like, like, healthy?

1067
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Kick healthy?

1068
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I feel like this stuff has meaning.

1069
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
I don't know.

1070
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I'm like the English teacher.

1071
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Are you kidding me?

1072
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Are you gay?

1073
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Why are you acting so dumb?

1074
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Huh?

1075
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
It should blow up as soon as possible.

1076
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
You're like shit.

1077
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000

1078
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Shut up.

1080
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Are you gay?

1081
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

1082
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Grab your popcorn? Okay wait, you're scaring me more than the game.

I...

1134
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000

1139
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000

1142
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Twitch? I know Twitch reviews their...

1143
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Okay.

1144
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Okay, that was kind of scary.

1145
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I know Twitch reviews their emails that you send in.

1146
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Does YouTube do the same thing?

1147
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I don't like dark hallways, man!

1148
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Oh my god, stop!

1149
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,000
They don't if you're a partner?

1150
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Well, I'm not a partner.

1151
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I don't know if YouTube reviews emails and if they're going to be like,

1152
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
and this is so I don't...

1153
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Oh my god, I don't like that. Stop saying that.

1154
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,000
That you the player character is Ludwig?

1155
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I'm Ludwig?

1156
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
How'd they know it's piss for all they know it's lemonade?

1157
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
There's another phone ringing.

1158
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
What?

1159
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Why is it coming from?

1160
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
I feel like I'm walking in a circle.

1161
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
It's coming from the left?

1162
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Oh!

1163
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Oh, fuck you!

1164
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I heard footsteps!

1165
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
I heard footsteps!

1166
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
I'm scared!

1167
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
I heard footsteps!

1168
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
No, I heard footsteps!

1169
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Is he gonna chase me through the halls?

1170
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Is he gonna chase me through the halls?

1171
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
I'm scared!

1172
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I really don't like dark games.

1173
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I really, really don't like them.

1174
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Like, I put the brightness all the way up and I still can't see anything.

1175
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,000
The game was at 100.

1176
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
What does a cat do to prey?

1177
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Eats it?

1178
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
What do you mean? Chases it?

1179
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Are you bad with horror?

1180
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I like playing them because they're fun, but I'm...

1181
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
I'm trying.

1182
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
How's the baby doing?

1183
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Why do you mean the baby?

1184
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
What is it saying now?

1185
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
He's talking about you.

1186
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
The baby's doing badly.

1187
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Are there?

1188
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
I hear purring.

1189
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Should I...?

1190
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I don't know what to do.

1191
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
I'm getting scared.

1192
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Which way?

1193
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Which way do I run?

1194
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Wait, if I have to run, which way do I run until me right now?

1195
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Stop pausing.

1196
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Stop, you're scaring me.

1197
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
But I feel like I should meet him first, right?

1198
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Stop.

1199
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I don't hear purring anymore.

1200
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
I don't hear purring anymore.

1201
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
You'll know if he chases you with me, don't worry.

1202
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I can't run now.

1203
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
I haven't met him yet.

1204
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I can't see anything.

1205
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Is this an empty hole?

1206
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Or not a dead end?

1207
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Just keep going left?

1208
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Okay.

1209
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Which way is left?

1210
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
This is what happens when kitten doesn't get kisses.

1211
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Didn't I come from this way?

1212
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Just keep heading forward.

1213
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I don't know which way is forward anymore.

1214
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I don't know which way is forward.

1215
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I don't know which way is forward.

1216
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
I don't know which way is forward.

1217
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I don't know which way is forward anymore.

1218
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
I'm kind of gay.

1219
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Why are you acting so gay?

1220
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Shut up.

1221
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Am I going the right direction?

1222
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Okay, wait. This is the dead end.

1223
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Stick to left?

1224
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Okay, I'll stick to left.

1225
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I know I'm going backwards. I'm confused.

1226
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I also can't see anything.

1227
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Guilt.

1228
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Guilt wants you.

1229
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Okay.

1230
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
You're being too loud.

1231
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Okay.

1232
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Open your eyes then.

1233
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
How much handhold are we doing?

1234
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
We're doing a lot.

1235
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Wait, this is another dead end.

1236
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
This is another dead end.

1237
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
There are no dead end.

1238
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
This is a dead end.

1239
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
We're doing a lot.

1240
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Are we doing a lot?

1241
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
We're doing a lot.

1242
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I don't know which way is forward.

1243
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Are we doing a lot?

1244
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
We're doing a lot.

1245
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
We're doing a lot.

1246
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Are we doing a lot?

1247
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
I don't know which way is forward.

1248
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Okay.

1249
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
What is that?

1250
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,800
But this is the sound.

1251
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:48,840
It's coming from here.

1252
01:38:48,840 --> 01:39:14,840
Oh man, I'm just making myself lost, aren't I?

1253
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:24,840
Go past radio.

1254
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,840
Oh.

1255
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:28,840
Oh.

1256
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:30,840
No, I feel like...

1257
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,840
Huh?

1258
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:38,840
Get up?

1259
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:40,840
Me?

1260
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:42,840
Get up.

1261
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:44,840
He said go left, right?

1262
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:50,840
Okay, left is a dead end here, so I'll go right.

1263
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,840
Don't tell me what to do.

1264
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:56,840
Only my big brother tells me what to do.

1265
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:58,840
It's so hard to see.

1266
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:00,840
I really can't see anything at all.

1267
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:08,840
I think I'm looking into a wall.

1268
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:18,840
This is another wall, isn't it?

1269
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:20,840
Should I turn off my lights?

1270
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:30,840
I seriously can't see anything.

1271
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:40,840
Should it be like this?

1272
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,840
Can you turn up the gamma?

1273
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:46,840
No, it's already all the way up.

1274
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:58,840
Was there something on the ceiling?

1275
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:12,840
Okay, I'm going to turn my lights off to see if I can see more.

1276
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:18,840
The hallway with the red light.

1277
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:20,840
That did nothing!

1278
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:34,840
Okay, hallway with the red light.

1279
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:40,840
Is this one red?

1280
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:54,840
I have not heard of Dark Deception though.

1281
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:58,840
Happy and fun?

1282
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:04,840
Why was it done?

1283
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:08,840
There is no safety here.

1284
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:12,840
Alright, that's comforting.

1285
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:16,840
Because I don't like safety.

1286
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,840
I don't make love.

1287
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:22,840
I frick hard.

1288
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:30,840
Where's the tape?

1289
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:34,840
What it is?

1290
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:38,840
Greetings, employees, and welcome to your first day here in playtime.

1291
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:45,840
We're certain that in the days to come, you'll find your new family here every bit as loving and supportive as your own.

1292
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:53,840
Feel free to wander the halls, sit in the mess for lunch, or watch our children play and learn to their little heart's content.

1293
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:57,840
Join the innovationists, where the bounds of science are continuously purchased.

1294
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,840
I feel like there should be another picture here.

1295
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:03,840
I feel like I shouldn't just be huggy with them.

1296
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:22,840
Sorry if you hear my chair creaking, it's very creaky.

1297
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:32,840
Should you come back years later, your conscience finally getting the better of you.

1298
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:41,840
May you descend into the dark and the dust, finding all that awaits you are incomprehensible horrors.

1299
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:51,840
Wait, I can't look away from the TV, it doesn't let me.

1300
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:59,840
Stop!

1301
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:02,840
Back up?

1302
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:09,840
I can't, I can't, I can't back up anymore.

1303
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:14,840
You're scaring me.

1304
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:18,840
The cat, oh I literally can't even move my mouse.

1305
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:25,840
Stop scaring me.

1306
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:28,840
Oh my god, oh my god.

1307
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:31,840
Where's the door?

1308
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I can't run anymore than this.

1309
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:38,840
Oh my god.

1310
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:42,840
It's so loud.

1311
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:47,840
I'm scared.

1312
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,840
Was I walking?

1313
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:53,840
I was trying to run, I was pressing shift.

1314
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,840
Did I do it wrong?

1315
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:00,840
Or was that supposed to happen?

1316
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:07,840
Bro, that was supposed to happen, wasn't it?

1317
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:18,840
Hold on, that was really loud when that happened.

1318
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:22,840
It was supposed to happen, get ready to run, who cares?

1319
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:25,840
Just let it kill me so I can get to the next part.

1320
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,840
Get ready to run, Amy, it's happening, Amy.

1321
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:32,840
Don't scare me like that, don't do that.

1322
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:43,840
Just say it's okay, Amy, whatever happens next is supposed to happen.

1323
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:47,840
Hello?

1324
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,840
It's puzzle time again.

1325
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,840
Can little sis use her gamer brain?

1326
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,840
No.

1327
01:45:54,840 --> 01:46:00,840
I hear noises in these rooms.

1328
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:02,840
Is more fun when you're scared?

1329
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:06,840
I guess so.

1330
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:11,840
Daddy, you long legs, hello.

1331
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:17,840
I didn't, he doesn't talk though, that's okay, I like a quiet man.

1332
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,840
I didn't know there was both a mommy and a daddy.

1333
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:35,840
Oh, another hole, are we supposed to jump down?

1334
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:39,840
Okay, I guess I'll jump down.

1335
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:43,840
Sorry, I'm really picky about this audio.

1336
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:49,840
I'll jump down now.

1337
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:52,840
Get the gas mask?

1338
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:57,840
Okay.

1339
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:04,840
Where is it?

1340
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:14,840
Am I dying? Am I dying? Am I dying? Where's the gas mask?

1341
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:16,840
It was above you.

1342
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:19,840
Well, now what?

1343
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:22,840
Looking up is hard?

1344
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:24,840
Oh.

1345
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:27,840
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

1346
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:30,840
Why did you get so happy when you saw daddy long legs?

1347
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:34,840
Is it a little emoto being a cheater?

1348
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:36,840
No, I'm not.

1349
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:45,840
I was happy when I saw mommy long legs too.

1350
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:52,840
Pull the handle?

1351
01:47:52,840 --> 01:48:01,840
I would never cheat on you, don't worry.

1352
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:04,840
What handle?

1353
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:16,840
There's no handle in the car.

1354
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:19,840
Back bumper?

1355
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:25,840
Oh, go!

1356
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:32,840
Okay, thank you.

1357
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:37,840
Do I do it again?

1358
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:38,840
Nothing happened.

1359
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:40,840
Oh wait, looking up is hard.

1360
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:44,840
Okay.

1361
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:46,840
Oh, it's a washing machine place.

1362
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:50,840
That's cool.

1363
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:53,840
I do have a lot of dirty clothes.

1364
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:59,840
Mommy long legs, daddy long legs, and there's a baby long legs.

1365
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:03,840
How would a toy do that with each other?

1366
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,840
It's a toy!

1367
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:10,840
They just manufactured a baby long legs.

1368
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:18,840
What the fuck kind of room is this?

1369
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:20,840
Wait.

1370
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:22,840
Wait, what?

1371
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:26,840
Wait.

1372
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:29,840
Why are they staring into a kid's room?

1373
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:32,840
Why are they looking into a little kid's room?

1374
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:37,840
Huh?

1375
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,840
They're observing the kids playing with the toys?

1376
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,840
But there's a bed here!

1377
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,840
This isn't an observation room, this is someone like,

1378
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:47,840
this is a kid living here and sleeping in here.

1379
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:53,840
What the fuck?

1380
01:49:53,840 --> 01:50:03,840
Can I not go through here?

1381
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,840
Why do I still hear, oh wait, it's me.

1382
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,840
How do I take it off?

1383
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:12,840
There we go.

1384
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:16,840
There's a man in the walls!

1385
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:25,840
Was this like, did the cat break through here?

1386
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:29,840
Close the door, close the door, close the door, close the door!

1387
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:33,840
Did you see that?

1388
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:35,840
You also look into people's homes, but that's different,

1389
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:39,840
I don't look into little kids' rooms.

1390
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,840
For toy popularity as well as testing the various medicines,

1391
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:45,840
you can take mask off, yes I did it.

1392
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:50,840
Didn't see it, oh my god, you're fucking blind.

1393
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:55,840
He was right in this hall.

1394
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:59,840
Which I can't go into.

1395
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:04,840
Here's another little kid's room.

1396
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:10,840
And another, oh no, oh my, these kids are so creative!

1397
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:13,840
Everybody's so creative!

1398
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,840
The cat stalks the halls, and guess who's the rat?

1399
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:24,840
Me, I'm the rat!

1400
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:29,840
Another door.

1401
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:34,840
Oh, that's very nice of them, they make it easy.

1402
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:45,840
And not the other one, I guess.

1403
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:49,840
You're seeing things, you're gaslighting me!

1404
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:53,840
Really, the rat makes her turn.

1405
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:57,840
You're gaslighting me, Katnaps gaslighting me.

1406
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:00,840
Everyone's gaslighting me, I don't deserve this.

1407
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:09,840
Oh my god, she's breathing.

1408
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:12,840
What do I do, she's breathing.

1409
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:23,840
Oh no, she's looking at a picture.

1410
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:28,840
Should I get closer, is that dangerous?

1411
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:32,840
Take that picture, is she?

1412
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:36,840
Get out of my room, I'm playing Minecraft!

1413
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:42,840
It doesn't let me go.

1414
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:46,840
I can't.

1415
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:55,840
I thought she was dead at first, so I was like, what's going on here?

1416
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,840
There's a furry on the wall!

1417
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:01,840
There's like paintings of her.

1418
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:07,840
Oh, it's the same girl.

1419
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:14,840
That makes me sad.

1420
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:17,840
Is this the place we came from?

1421
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:22,840
Yeah.

1422
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:25,840
Okay, I can't go through there.

1423
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:27,840
She's waiting for me to go live?

1424
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,840
I am live.

1425
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:32,840
I'm live right now, you don't need to wait.

1426
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:40,840
We're paying gloopy fatty time.

1427
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:45,840
Where's the other pack?

1428
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:49,840
Where's the other energy pack?

1429
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:57,840
Stop being sad out here in your voice, I don't know why I felt bad for her.

1430
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:03,840
Her being sad made me sad.

1431
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:06,840
This game better have a good ending for Huggy and Kissy.

1432
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:11,840
Up near Kissy?

1433
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:14,840
Where was Kissy?

1434
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:21,840
Where was she?

1435
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:23,840
Hide.

1436
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:26,840
Watch out.

1437
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:33,840
Well, it's not in here.

1438
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,840
Is it in this room?

1439
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:42,840
Damn girl, you live like this?

1440
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:48,840
I think this might be the last chapter that's out so far, but I think there's more chapters coming out.

1441
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:53,840
90% sure it's not a spoiler because it's a theory based around the chapter 2.

1442
01:54:53,840 --> 01:55:03,840
A theory that Poppy will betray us at some point, like I said in chapter 2.

1443
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:09,840
They replicated Amy's room. That's not true, shut up. It doesn't look that bad.

1444
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:21,840
But the other battery pack isn't here.

1445
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:25,840
Look up in the hallways, there's something to pull you up.

1446
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:36,840
Oh, thank you.

1447
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:50,840
I got random kids on the walls. I hope they got permission to get these random kids in their game because otherwise that would be awkward to steal pictures of random kids.

1448
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:54,840
Why have you returned?

1449
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:56,840
I don't know.

1450
01:55:56,840 --> 01:56:02,840
Why have I returned?

1451
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:07,840
No, all the orphans.

1452
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:12,840
All the orphans are dead.

1453
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:17,840
Oh, someone, this one was also a robot.

1454
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:24,840
Was it?

1455
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:27,840
Returned for daddy long legs, obviously.

1456
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:32,840
No, I came back for Huggy Wuggy if anything. Is that all I need in this room?

1457
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:43,840
Because then I'm going to leave.

1458
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:52,840
What happened here? Was a little kid bad or something and they locked him in his room?

1459
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:55,840
Wait.

1460
01:56:55,840 --> 01:57:01,840
Oh, okay.

1461
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:13,840
Sorry, I'm kind of scared right now. I know it's a puzzle, I shouldn't be scared, but...

1462
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:17,840
Oh, the door opened.

1463
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:27,840
Gamers can't look up, they discovered this during the play testing of Half-Life 2, so they put lights everywhere. This was eventually solved with bright yellow paint.

1464
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:39,840
I just never think to look up, okay? How am I supposed to know? I look straight ahead, like a real alpha.

1465
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:46,840
We don't look up at others, okay? We only look down at others.

1466
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:51,840
Oh, it's you again.

1467
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:58,840
Damn, that's so cool. Radical.

1468
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:08,840
I would think one who's always so short would always look up. No, I only look down at people.

1469
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:13,840
And then I tell them to open their mouth and I go...

1470
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:22,840
Just like Sheevee.

1471
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:30,840
None of these doors are open. Oh, this one's open.

1472
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:41,840
I Hock-Twa. God, that meme is so cringe.

1473
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:45,840
Am I supposed to watch something here?

1474
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:50,840
I am gay. Why are you acting so gay?

1475
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:55,840
Remember the name Dog Day? Nope, I don't. What about it?

1476
01:58:55,840 --> 01:59:00,840
Is there a dog here? Like, do they have a dog toy?

1477
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:05,840
Very normie-pilled. I just think that meme is kind of cringe.

1478
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:11,840
Like, it's like worse than Zoomer meme. It's like...

1479
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:16,840
What's after Zoomer? What's the generation after Zoomer? I forgot.

1480
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:23,840
Someone tell me. Generation Alpha?

1481
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:28,840
Yeah, it's like Gen Alpha-pilled kind of meme.

1482
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:33,840
Which is even worse than Zoomer memes.

1483
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,840
There we go.

1484
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:38,840
Now, what do I do with this?

1485
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:46,840
And also, where's the tape for this?

1486
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:50,840
Which one is it? Eat, eat, eat?

1487
01:59:50,840 --> 02:00:01,840
Can I touch everything until I find one that works?

1488
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:07,840
I need to look up again.

1489
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:14,840
Oh! Dammit.

1490
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:17,840
Thank you.

1491
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:24,840
Oh, there's another one.

1492
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:28,840
What?

1493
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:30,840
Wait, what?

1494
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:35,840
Did I just get trapped in this room?

1495
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:38,840
Are you kidding me?

1496
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:40,840
That's what we say about Zoomer memes.

1497
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:45,840
Zoomer memes are better than Gen Alpha memes. You gotta admit they are.

1498
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:50,840
Gen Alpha memes is like stupid skibbity toilet.

1499
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:54,840
You're so phantom tax, you're so fucking... I don't know.

1500
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:56,840
You're so skibbity.

1501
02:00:56,840 --> 02:00:58,840
Are you gay? That's cringe.

1502
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:02,840
Why are you acting so gay?

1503
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:07,840
Ready to play a game? How about red light green light?

1504
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:10,840
That doesn't tell me anything.

1505
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:15,840
I thought skibbity was Zoomer. No, that's Gen Alpha.

1506
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:21,840
No.

1507
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:26,840
Zoomers did not give a shit about skibbity toilet. I can tell you that.

1508
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:33,840
Oh! Oh, he's up now. He stood up.

1509
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:39,840
Same thing with Ohio Sigma and all the other cringe ones.

1510
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:44,840
The cringe ones that are bad and not based are Gen Alpha.

1511
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:07,840
Okay, hot. Where's my fan?

1512
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:09,840
Wait, where is my fan? Where did I put it?

1513
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:14,840
Should I think I left it outside of my bedroom?

1514
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:21,840
The Mock and Jalad. I have not even heard of the Mock and Jalad.

1515
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:34,840
Where do I go?

1516
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:48,840
I feel like I should go through here, but I can't.

1517
02:02:48,840 --> 02:03:04,840
It doesn't let me. And then I can't press this either.

1518
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:13,840
Left of the door, there's an opening.

1519
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:19,840
Here?

1520
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:23,840
Which door? There's like three doors.

1521
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:34,840
Left this door?

1522
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:41,840
You were just there?

1523
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:49,840
Is it this one?

1524
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:54,840
But I couldn't go through that one.

1525
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:57,840
This one?

1526
02:03:57,840 --> 02:04:02,840
Are you gay? Why are you acting so gay?

1527
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:05,840
Oh!

1528
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:08,840
You got the power. Okay, okay, okay, I got it.

1529
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:10,840
But then where do I put it? Up here?

1530
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:14,840
Oh, fuck.

1531
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:18,840
Thank you for the $1 don't know. I don't know what you mean, though.

1532
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:22,840
I don't know who's watching.

1533
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:27,840
Okay, what did that do?

1534
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:35,840
Did that just... What did that do?

1535
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:54,840
I have a time limit for what? Does that open the door?

1536
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:59,840
What did that do?

1537
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:09,840
That was just to waste your time?

1538
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:19,840
You're not being helpful. It's okay, I'll figure it out myself.

1539
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:35,840
Maybe somewhere else?

1540
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:43,840
We're trying here? Try harder!

1541
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:47,840
There's a door that opens. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1542
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:55,840
Sorry, I know you're trying your best. I'm sure some of you are trying hard to tell me what to do,

1543
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:59,840
but it's getting lost in chat sometimes, too.

1544
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:05,840
And also, I'm really bad at the game.

1545
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:13,840
Okay, a door that opens.

1546
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:19,840
I lose this power so quickly.

1547
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:22,840
Spent this whole stream trying to cut her and she's yelling at me.

1548
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:26,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I appreciate your help.

1549
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:28,840
Thank you for helping.

1550
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:32,840
Okay, now which door opened?

1551
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:36,840
Oh, this one!

1552
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:40,840
Okay, okay, I see it now. I see it now. Thank you.

1553
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:45,840
I got it.

1554
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:48,840
Wait, which door was it again?

1555
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:51,840
Wait, I lost the door, I lost the door!

1556
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:55,840
Oh, fuck, okay, okay, okay, I got this, I got this, I got this, I got this.

1557
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:58,840
Here, fuck.

1558
02:06:58,840 --> 02:07:01,840
Here.

1559
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:04,840
Oh, I lost the door again.

1560
02:07:04,840 --> 02:07:11,840
Okay, fuck.

1561
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:13,840
It's that door.

1562
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:18,840
I keep getting, like, confused.

1563
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:21,840
Oh my god.

1564
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:25,840
Whenever I keep going the wrong direction.

1565
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:29,840
Get it! Touch it!

1566
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:37,840
There.

1567
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:40,840
Bro, I'm losing the door, I'm losing the door.

1568
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:45,840
I'm losing the door every time.

1569
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:55,840
I keep getting disoriented.

1570
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:59,840
It's the door, it's the door, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1571
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:06,840
Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1572
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:11,840
It'll go right, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, thank you.

1573
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:14,840
I keep, I'm really, really bad with directions.

1574
02:08:14,840 --> 02:08:17,840
I've always really been bad with directions.

1575
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:20,840
Do I have to get this again from here?

1576
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:28,840
No way, right?

1577
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:29,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1578
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:37,840
Okay, that was an easy door, that was an easy door.

1579
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:38,840
Oh look, it's the bathroom.

1580
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:40,840
Do you need to go to the bathroom?

1581
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:42,840
You can go in through here.

1582
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:43,840
Go left, go straight.

1583
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:46,840
I don't, I don't actually know my left from right.

1584
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:51,840
I just have to pull, like, take out my fingers and do that L.

1585
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:56,840
Do that L shape with my fingers to tell which one's left and which one's right.

1586
02:08:56,840 --> 02:09:08,840
Um, hi.

1587
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:15,840
Oh my god, he turned.

1588
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:25,840
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1589
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:28,840
Okay, nevermind, I thought I was going to turn away and he was going to be closer.

1590
02:09:28,840 --> 02:09:39,840
Um, you're just special, I am very special.

1591
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:46,840
So, and you're special too.

1592
02:09:46,840 --> 02:09:48,840
We're special together.

1593
02:09:48,840 --> 02:09:50,840
He's hiding the battery from you.

1594
02:09:50,840 --> 02:09:55,840
Oh.

1595
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:57,840
I used to think people not knowing they're left and right was a myth.

1596
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:00,840
I no longer have that much faith in humanity.

1597
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:03,840
Well, it's okay.

1598
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:07,840
What am I going to do anyways?

1599
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:10,840
You think I was going to find the cure to cancer?

1600
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:16,840
There was never much faith in me to begin with.

1601
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:21,840
So it's okay that I don't know my left from right.

1602
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:22,840
Oh, that's too small.

1603
02:10:22,840 --> 02:10:23,840
I can't read that.

1604
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:26,840
Hold on.

1605
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:27,840
See you.

1606
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:28,840
Emma's got to go.

1607
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:29,840
Okay, bye.

1608
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:33,840
Thank you for the super chat.

1609
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:36,840
His mouth is wide open for me.

1610
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:40,840
Ew, stinky.

1611
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:42,840
And plus, you shouldn't open it.

1612
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:46,840
You should just put your mouth on the source and suck it out.

1613
02:10:46,840 --> 02:10:47,840
Oh my god.

1614
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:49,840
I surprised myself saying that.

1615
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:53,840
Why are you acting so gay?

1616
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:54,840
Don't worry, Emmy.

1617
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:56,840
Anime's get closer when you look away.

1618
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:57,840
That comes later.

1619
02:10:57,840 --> 02:10:58,840
Oh, okay, okay.

1620
02:10:58,840 --> 02:10:59,840
Oh, hey.

1621
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:01,840
Got it from you.

1622
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:03,840
Sucker.

1623
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:05,840
Okay.

1624
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:07,840
What?

1625
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:11,840
What do you think the gen after gen alpha's humor will be?

1626
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:16,840
And will it be worse than the skewery edge Riz, Ohio Rizzler sticker?

1627
02:11:16,840 --> 02:11:17,840
Yeah.

1628
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:18,840
Humor.

1629
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:19,840
I think it will be worse.

1630
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:21,840
And I think, um, I think it's hopeless.

1631
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:25,840
And I think we should all give up.

1632
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:27,840
I don't really care that much.

1633
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:31,840
I was never really one to be like, ah, fuck kids.

1634
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,840
The fuck kids these days.

1635
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:34,840
Yeah.

1636
02:11:34,840 --> 02:11:36,840
Like, oh, kids these days suck balls.

1637
02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:37,840
I hate them.

1638
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:39,840
I've always just disliked kids, but it's not.

1639
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:42,840
It's not really a kids these days kind of thing.

1640
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:45,840
And it's also not kids that like kids.

1641
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:49,840
It's not the kids fault that they have bad humor.

1642
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:52,840
Their parents raise them to have shit humor.

1643
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:53,840
So it's okay.

1644
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:54,840
They can't.

1645
02:11:54,840 --> 02:11:56,840
It's not their fault.

1646
02:11:56,840 --> 02:12:02,840
Um, what do I do with this?

1647
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:08,840
Stickin' out your gap for the Rizzler.

1648
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:11,840
That's, I should shut up.

1649
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:16,840
I should shut up.

1650
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:17,840
Yeah.

1651
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:20,840
Each generation is more current than the previous one.

1652
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:23,840
And that's okay.

1653
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:25,840
That's just, that's just a prophecy.

1654
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:30,840
That's just how it goes.

1655
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:31,840
Um, oh, okay.

1656
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:33,840
There we go.

1657
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:34,840
Nice.

1658
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:40,840
Did we get, did we get a hundred percent battery?

1659
02:12:40,840 --> 02:12:48,840
Wait, where'd the other one go?

1660
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:50,840
Who stole my other one?

1661
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:59,840
Was it the cat?

1662
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:07,840
Huh?

1663
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:09,840
You were on the other side of the building.

1664
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:12,840
Oh, what?

1665
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:14,840
What do I do with this?

1666
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:17,840
I am?

1667
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:23,840
Huh?

1668
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,840
Friends forever.

1669
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:29,840
Huh?

1670
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:32,840
That's cute.

1671
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:35,840
There's a thing over there, but it's not open.

1672
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:37,840
But the rooms are so similar.

1673
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:40,840
Oh, do I?

1674
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:43,840
Hmm.

1675
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:45,840
You have to find another battery.

1676
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:46,840
You have to get like four batteries.

1677
02:13:46,840 --> 02:13:48,840
Oh!

1678
02:13:48,840 --> 02:13:55,840
That's so much work.

1679
02:13:55,840 --> 02:14:00,840
I can't expect me to do all that.

1680
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:02,840
I like the music though.

1681
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:14,840
Why are you acting so gay?

1682
02:14:14,840 --> 02:14:16,840
Oh, thank you.

1683
02:14:16,840 --> 02:14:18,840
I'm glad I'm not alone.

1684
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:21,840
And thank you for the $5.

1685
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:23,840
Why do you sound lost?

1686
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:25,840
Because I am lost.

1687
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:28,840
I'm perpetually lost in this game.

1688
02:14:28,840 --> 02:14:34,840
And perpetually confused.

1689
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:37,840
And perpetually a little frustrated.

1690
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:42,840
Both sexually and emotionally.

1691
02:14:42,840 --> 02:14:44,840
Wait, should I not say that word?

1692
02:14:44,840 --> 02:14:46,840
I noticed a lot of my vods get limited ads.

1693
02:14:46,840 --> 02:14:48,840
Should I say sexually?

1694
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:50,840
No, that sounds too close.

1695
02:14:50,840 --> 02:14:52,840
Exually?

1696
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:54,840
Exually lost?

1697
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:59,840
Help.

1698
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:00,840
Help me!

1699
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:05,840
I'm the one that needs help.

1700
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:07,840
Get to the door.

1701
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:08,840
Yes.

1702
02:15:08,840 --> 02:15:13,840
Where is the power?

1703
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:22,840
Where is it?

1704
02:15:22,840 --> 02:15:23,840
Oh, there's something here.

1705
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:24,840
Okay.

1706
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:25,840
Let me get...

1707
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:37,840
Okay.

1708
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:40,840
Oh, it goes all the way up here.

1709
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:42,840
Oh!

1710
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:43,840
Is it closed?

1711
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:45,840
Oh, shit, it closes after.

1712
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:46,840
Oh!

1713
02:15:46,840 --> 02:15:52,840
Wait, oops.

1714
02:15:52,840 --> 02:15:55,840
Um, actually...

1715
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:59,840
Um...

1716
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:14,840
Um...

1717
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:19,840
Did I just lock myself in?

1718
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:21,840
I can't hit it through the bars.

1719
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:24,840
Did I seriously just lock myself in here?

1720
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:31,840
Did they not think about this?

1721
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:36,840
Did they seriously not think about this?

1722
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:45,840
That some stupid player like me would play and lock herself in the hall, in the stairs?

1723
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:50,840
Vent?

1724
02:16:50,840 --> 02:16:52,840
What do you mean, vent?

1725
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:54,840
There's no vent here.

1726
02:16:54,840 --> 02:16:55,840
I'm not the imposter.

1727
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:57,840
I can't vent.

1728
02:16:57,840 --> 02:16:58,840
Oh.

1729
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:04,840
That's fine, there's a vent here.

1730
02:17:04,840 --> 02:17:09,840
Which way do I go?

1731
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:16,840
Does it matter?

1732
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:22,840
Thank you for showing me the vent.

1733
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:28,840
Wait, was I supposed to get stuck there?

1734
02:17:28,840 --> 02:17:33,840
Ah, they did think about the stupid players like me that would get stuck.

1735
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:38,840
Okay, let's um...

1736
02:17:38,840 --> 02:17:42,840
I don't know, try this again?

1737
02:17:42,840 --> 02:17:50,840
Am I supposed to...

1738
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:53,840
I don't know.

1739
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:59,840
Man, I'm not smart enough for this.

1740
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:05,840
This one definitely lasts a little longer.

1741
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:12,840
You don't want to be there anymore?

1742
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:14,840
What is this vent used for then?

1743
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:16,840
Is it the same vent?

1744
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:20,840
It is.

1745
02:18:20,840 --> 02:18:23,840
There's a door with two power sources that you need to open.

1746
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:25,840
Yeah, I saw that.

1747
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:29,840
Is it this one?

1748
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:31,840
Okay, there's a door.

1749
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:33,840
No, it's not this one.

1750
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:42,840
It followed this, was it?

1751
02:18:42,840 --> 02:18:49,840
Where is that door?

1752
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:50,840
No, you didn't?

1753
02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:51,840
It's right here.

1754
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:53,840
Okay, it's right here.

1755
02:18:53,840 --> 02:19:01,840
So, do I just like...

1756
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:07,840
I don't have the fricking directional skills for this.

1757
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:11,840
I really don't.

1758
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:18,840
So, here's the room.

1759
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:27,840
I don't have the directional skills to find that door quick enough.

1760
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:36,840
I don't know where the other room is.

1761
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:38,840
Oh, that's the wrong door.

1762
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:41,840
It's straight down the hall, it's easy.

1763
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:44,840
No, it's not.

1764
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:47,840
I promise you, I'm seriously not acting dumb right now.

1765
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:50,840
I'm actually just dumb.

1766
02:19:50,840 --> 02:19:56,840
So, am I supposed to do this?

1767
02:19:56,840 --> 02:20:00,840
I feel like this isn't the right thing to do, is it?

1768
02:20:00,840 --> 02:20:08,840
Oh, but the other one just...

1769
02:20:08,840 --> 02:20:11,840
I don't think I'm doing it right.

1770
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:12,840
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1771
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:17,840
No!

1772
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:18,840
You are doing it right?

1773
02:20:18,840 --> 02:20:20,840
You just need to be quicker?

1774
02:20:20,840 --> 02:20:22,840
Okay.

1775
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:29,840
Okay.

1776
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:39,840
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1777
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:40,840
Oh my god!

1778
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:47,840
Dude, I'm too stupid for this game!

1779
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:50,840
I don't know if I can do it.

1780
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:53,840
Power on the stairs is closer?

1781
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:56,840
Bring up the guide?

1782
02:20:56,840 --> 02:21:03,840
There's another one?

1783
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:06,840
But this power...

1784
02:21:06,840 --> 02:21:23,840
This power doesn't do anything.

1785
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:32,840
Hold on.

1786
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:36,840
No, that doesn't do it.

1787
02:21:36,840 --> 02:21:40,840
While the doors are open, grab the power from the upstairs hallway and use it for the second power.

1788
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:42,840
I tried doing that.

1789
02:21:42,840 --> 02:21:45,840
Okay, I'll look up a playthrough.

1790
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:55,840
I'll look up a playthrough.

1791
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:56,840
Wait, am I on chapter three?

1792
02:21:56,840 --> 02:22:07,840
Wait, is chapter four already out?

1793
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:13,840
No way it's out already, right?

1794
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:15,840
Sorry, I'm getting a...

1795
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:17,840
I'm getting a Popeye's bonus wings.

1796
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:18,840
By the way, I tried those?

1797
02:22:18,840 --> 02:22:19,840
They sucked ass.

1798
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:20,840
They were just chicken nuggets.

1799
02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:44,840
They sucked so hard.

1800
02:22:44,840 --> 02:22:46,840
Okay, we were past that.

1801
02:22:47,840 --> 02:23:00,840
Okay, we got there.

1802
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:03,840
It's around 49 minutes?

1803
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:05,840
Okay.

1804
02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:10,840
Okay, he puts it in there, and then what do you do?

1805
02:23:10,840 --> 02:23:11,840
Oh, he puts it in the other hole.

1806
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:19,840
I guess it doesn't matter.

1807
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:22,840
I hate it when they explore the game too.

1808
02:23:22,840 --> 02:23:28,840
I get so pissed.

1809
02:23:28,840 --> 02:23:31,840
I just expect them to know how to play the game right away and show me.

1810
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:33,840
So I get so pissed when they're like,

1811
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:34,840
Okay, what do I do here?

1812
02:23:34,840 --> 02:23:36,840
Oh, this room has nothing in it.

1813
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:37,840
Okay, cool.

1814
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:38,840
Okay, great.

1815
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:39,840
Great.

1816
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:44,840
Let's touch this random thing.

1817
02:23:44,840 --> 02:24:05,840
Also the time I look...

1818
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:06,840
Okay.

1819
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:08,840
Also the time I look up guides for games,

1820
02:24:08,840 --> 02:24:11,840
because I'm way too stupid and lazy to figure it out.

1821
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:14,840
Well, I try to figure it out with your help.

1822
02:24:14,840 --> 02:24:16,840
Why is the screen like that?

1823
02:24:16,840 --> 02:24:18,840
I try to figure it out with your help,

1824
02:24:18,840 --> 02:24:20,840
but sometimes we're both too stupid.

1825
02:24:20,840 --> 02:24:22,840
And that's okay.

1826
02:24:22,840 --> 02:24:24,840
Okay.

1827
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:35,840
Or sometimes I'm just too stupid to figure out your instructions,

1828
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:44,840
which is probably the more accurate way of explaining it.

1829
02:24:44,840 --> 02:24:47,840
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1830
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:49,840
Let's go!

1831
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:52,840
Oh, you didn't even see that.

1832
02:24:52,840 --> 02:25:01,840
I forget YouTube covered it up.

1833
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:02,840
I'm sorry.

1834
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:04,840
I didn't realize that I had the YouTube cover...

1835
02:25:04,840 --> 02:25:13,840
Oh, I had the YouTube covering it.

1836
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:17,840
There's no monsters here.

1837
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:19,840
Wait, there's nothing in here.

1838
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:21,840
What was the point?

1839
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:25,840
Oh, it's this?

1840
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:30,840
Can we be sure that she actually did it on her own?

1841
02:25:30,840 --> 02:25:31,840
I cheated.

1842
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:33,840
I hacked into the game.

1843
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:38,840
I was covering up my tracks.

1844
02:25:38,840 --> 02:25:42,840
Why are all the toys hung by their freaking necks, bro?

1845
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:46,840
And why does it keep telling me to hide?

1846
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:51,840
There's nothing to hide yet, or nothing to hide from yet.

1847
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:56,840
Okay, there's no toy hanging by its neck here, at least.

1848
02:25:56,840 --> 02:25:57,840
Chapter four.

1849
02:25:57,840 --> 02:26:02,840
I'd assume it's fan-made, but nothing says it is.

1850
02:26:02,840 --> 02:26:07,840
Tentacle tear with the character Octopussycat.

1851
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:09,840
You made that up.

1852
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:10,840
You made that up.

1853
02:26:10,840 --> 02:26:12,840
Tentacle tear.

1854
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:18,840
Pussycat.

1855
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:25,840
Chapter four.

1856
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:28,840
Now the development of previous chapters.

1857
02:26:28,840 --> 02:26:34,840
Okay, so there's no official date, basically, is what it seems like.

1858
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:39,840
Yeah.

1859
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:41,840
There's no official release date.

1860
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:42,840
Okay.

1861
02:26:42,840 --> 02:26:44,840
Octopussycat.

1862
02:26:44,840 --> 02:26:49,840
I may be stupid, but I'm not that stupid.

1863
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:50,840
Ain't no way.

1864
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:54,840
Uh-oh, gas mask, gas mask.

1865
02:26:54,840 --> 02:26:59,840
Did the gas kill all the kitties?

1866
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:02,840
Oh.

1867
02:27:02,840 --> 02:27:05,840
Did all the kids die from gas?

1868
02:27:05,840 --> 02:27:08,840
Some toys didn't go along.

1869
02:27:08,840 --> 02:27:15,840
Understandable.

1870
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:18,840
They made a different game so they might not care to finish this one?

1871
02:27:18,840 --> 02:27:20,840
No way.

1872
02:27:20,840 --> 02:27:22,840
No way.

1873
02:27:22,840 --> 02:27:24,840
This one's so popular, though.

1874
02:27:24,840 --> 02:27:27,840
I would really want to finish this.

1875
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:29,840
Damn.

1876
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:33,840
Staring at the kids.

1877
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:36,840
Do I take this back now, I'm guessing?

1878
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:39,840
The gas is used to subdue the kitties and make sure they stay compliant.

1879
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:40,840
Is that real?

1880
02:27:40,840 --> 02:27:42,840
That's creepy.

1881
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:47,840
I hope that's not real.

1882
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:50,840
I mean, it did take a long time to get these games out.

1883
02:27:50,840 --> 02:27:52,840
I remember when it first came out.

1884
02:27:52,840 --> 02:27:54,840
It was quite a while ago, wasn't it?

1885
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:57,840
Ah, I shouldn't have done that.

1886
02:27:57,840 --> 02:28:02,840
Okay.

1887
02:28:02,840 --> 02:28:04,840
So, it's okay.

1888
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:09,840
I'm willing to wait for games.

1889
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:13,840
Do-do-do-do-do.

1890
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:18,840
Did the door open?

1891
02:28:18,840 --> 02:28:20,840
It's funny how that sounds like some little kids' logic,

1892
02:28:20,840 --> 02:28:23,840
but the game actually works like that.

1893
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:25,840
What sounds like little kids' logic?

1894
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:27,840
How long does it take me to get back to the battery room?

1895
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:33,840
Uh, no time at all.

1896
02:28:33,840 --> 02:28:40,840
The gas was used to knock it-was-

1897
02:28:40,840 --> 02:28:41,840
I heard something fall.

1898
02:28:41,840 --> 02:28:43,840
Sorry, that scared the shit out of me.

1899
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:47,840
Hold on, I'll be right back.

1900
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:50,840
Thank you for watching.

1901
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:21,840
I was still muted.

1902
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:22,840
Okay.

1903
02:31:22,840 --> 02:31:23,840
Hi, everything's fine.

1904
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:26,840
I heard something fall and I-I thought like a bookshelf broke down or something,

1905
02:31:26,840 --> 02:31:30,840
but apparently nothing fell, I don't know.

1906
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:32,840
I didn't see anything wrong.

1907
02:31:32,840 --> 02:31:36,840
Um, I do think I'll stop here to, like,

1908
02:31:36,840 --> 02:31:39,840
yap a little bit and then end, though.

1909
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:42,840
Um, just because it's getting really hot in here.

1910
02:31:42,840 --> 02:31:49,840
So, let me go back to the chatting screen.

1911
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:51,840
Okay.

1912
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:58,840
I'll talk a little more and then we'll-we'll, uh, continue the game another day.

1913
02:31:58,840 --> 02:32:01,840
I haven't already planned on my schedule for next week,

1914
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:04,840
so we'll definitely keep playing.

1915
02:32:04,840 --> 02:32:08,840
Um...

1916
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:09,840
Yeah, I'm-I'm cool and done.

1917
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:10,840
I got-I found my fan.

1918
02:32:10,840 --> 02:32:12,840
I left it in the bathroom.

1919
02:32:12,840 --> 02:32:17,840
I also got chocolate.

1920
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:19,840
You're getting to the good parts?

1921
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:20,840
Well, we'll get to the good parts next week.

1922
02:32:20,840 --> 02:32:23,840
I literally have, um...

1923
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:24,840
I have it done for next week.

1924
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:26,840
I think it's the first game I play next week.

1925
02:32:26,840 --> 02:32:31,840
Though, I won't be able to stream on Tuesday.

1926
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:33,840
Yeah, it's more bueno.

1927
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:49,840
Sorry.

1928
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:51,840
Um, I won't be able to stream on Monday,

1929
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:54,840
because that's obviously my usual day that I don't stream,

1930
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:56,840
and then I also won't be able to stream on Tuesday,

1931
02:32:56,840 --> 02:33:03,840
because I have-actually, do I choose-did I choose to stream on Tuesday?

1932
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:05,840
Let me check my schedule!

1933
02:33:05,840 --> 02:33:19,840
I have a vet appointment, and it's in, like, the middle of the day on Tuesday.

1934
02:33:19,840 --> 02:33:27,840
I don't remember my password for the company schedule.

1935
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:34,840
Um...

1936
02:33:34,840 --> 02:33:36,840
Alright.

1937
02:33:36,840 --> 02:33:38,840
I don't remember my password.

1938
02:33:38,840 --> 02:33:43,840
I'll check later.

1939
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:45,840
So, I may do some more part two?

1940
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:46,840
Maybe.

1941
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:50,840
I don't know.

1942
02:33:50,840 --> 02:33:54,840
I don't know what I would do as a part two.

1943
02:33:54,840 --> 02:34:00,840
The problem with part twos is that, um,

1944
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:08,840
every single, um, video I upload that has, like, a plot to it,

1945
02:34:08,840 --> 02:34:12,840
people ask for part twos.

1946
02:34:12,840 --> 02:34:16,840
So, like, yeah.

1947
02:34:16,840 --> 02:34:19,840
Like, every single video I upload with a plot to it,

1948
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:22,840
I get, like, tons of comments asking for part twos,

1949
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:27,840
so it's, like, I should really-I really just choose which, um,

1950
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:35,840
videos I want to have part twos and which ones don't, and most don't.

1951
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:40,840
Mostly because I don't know what else to say, you know?

1952
02:34:40,840 --> 02:34:42,840
Keep us up to date on the rat health.

1953
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:43,840
I absolutely will.

1954
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:44,840
Though, I don't know.

1955
02:34:44,840 --> 02:34:51,840
I feel like-I don't want to, like, stress you guys out with, like, rat health stuff,

1956
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:57,840
because, um, like, I didn't-I didn't get my rats from, like,

1957
02:34:57,840 --> 02:35:01,840
I should put on the music, hold on.

1958
02:35:01,840 --> 02:35:04,840
I don't want to stress you guys out with, like, rat health updates,

1959
02:35:04,840 --> 02:35:08,840
because I didn't get my rats from any sort of reputable breeder or anything,

1960
02:35:08,840 --> 02:35:12,840
so their genetics are probably really fucked up,

1961
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:18,840
so the chances of them, like, um, like, getting health issues is really high,

1962
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:20,840
and I don't want to constantly be telling you, like,

1963
02:35:20,840 --> 02:35:25,840
oh, you know, another rat has another health issue, you know?

1964
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:35,840
Because that's going to be really depressing, you know?

1965
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:38,840
It doesn't stress me out, I just think they're cute.

1966
02:35:38,840 --> 02:35:40,840
We care about them, too.

1967
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:45,840
It's just going to be so sad to tell you, like, every time a rat dies.

1968
02:35:45,840 --> 02:35:57,840
I don't know.

1969
02:35:57,840 --> 02:36:01,840
We care because there are rats, too.

1970
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:03,840
There are family we want to know.

1971
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:08,840
Okay.

1972
02:36:08,840 --> 02:36:11,840
Don't feel like you can't talk about it either.

1973
02:36:11,840 --> 02:36:18,840
Okay.

1974
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:25,840
Yeah, they're really short-lived, and, um,

1975
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:30,840
and sometimes they die in really depressing ways,

1976
02:36:30,840 --> 02:36:36,840
so I don't want to, like, yeah, be updating you.

1977
02:36:36,840 --> 02:37:04,840
The depressing way my rat is dying.

1978
02:37:04,840 --> 02:37:05,840
Are you gay?

1979
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:07,840
Sorry, I'm getting distracted.

1980
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:15,840
I'm reading her.

1981
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:17,840
Oh, why?

1982
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:19,840
Wait, is there another one out?

1983
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:20,840
Tuesday?

1984
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:22,840
I don't know.

1985
02:37:22,840 --> 02:37:23,840
Is there already another one out?

1986
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:26,840
Should we listen to it together?

1987
02:37:26,840 --> 02:37:31,840
Another audio watch along?

1988
02:37:31,840 --> 02:37:36,840
Oh, wait, I searched up Pinterest instead of Patreon.

1989
02:37:36,840 --> 02:37:41,840
That would be crazy.

1990
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:52,840
There's no new one yet, unfortunately.

1991
02:37:52,840 --> 02:37:53,840
Should be tonight?

1992
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:55,840
Okay, okay, okay.

1993
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:58,840
Then we won't bully audio.

1994
02:37:58,840 --> 02:38:02,840
I don't even remember recording that one.

1995
02:38:02,840 --> 02:38:06,840
It should drop at seven, right, really?

1996
02:38:06,840 --> 02:38:08,840
Sometimes they are a little late.

1997
02:38:08,840 --> 02:38:11,840
Sometimes the editors don't have enough time to finish them,

1998
02:38:11,840 --> 02:38:15,840
um, right on the time they're supposed to, I guess.

1999
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:19,840
I only just recently told Strani that if the editors are backed up,

2000
02:38:19,840 --> 02:38:21,840
I can edit my own audio.

2001
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:25,840
So hopefully, if that ever happens in the future,

2002
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:36,840
I can just edit it myself and have it up on time.

2003
02:38:36,840 --> 02:38:39,840
Sorry, I'm reading our Discord server right now.

2004
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:43,840
I'm like, ooh, what is everyone talking about?

2005
02:38:43,840 --> 02:38:46,840
Every time I wake up in the morning, it's like the first thing I read.

2006
02:38:46,840 --> 02:38:50,840
I read what the other girls have been talking to each other about.

2007
02:38:50,840 --> 02:38:51,840
It's kind of fun.

2008
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:52,840
It's a fun thing.

2009
02:38:52,840 --> 02:38:55,840
Like, I've never had, like, a group chat like this,

2010
02:38:55,840 --> 02:39:01,840
um, where, like, everyone talks to each other so often.

2011
02:39:01,840 --> 02:39:03,840
It's fun.

2012
02:39:03,840 --> 02:39:05,840
Um, you do watch alongs for those?

2013
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:07,840
Not really, not officially.

2014
02:39:07,840 --> 02:39:09,840
Um, just, it's just for fun.

2015
02:39:09,840 --> 02:39:11,840
Last time I did it.

2016
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:13,840
Oh, my chest.

2017
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:16,840
Okay, um.

2018
02:39:16,840 --> 02:39:21,840
Yes, Poppy Playtime, our favorite Patreon reaction audio stream.

2019
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:23,840
It would be nice to see your own touches on it.

2020
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:25,840
Oh, well, I haven't written any scripts yet,

2021
02:39:25,840 --> 02:39:27,840
so it's not really my own touches.

2022
02:39:27,840 --> 02:39:33,840
It's mostly just my own editing and my own, um, sound effects, I guess.

2023
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:36,840
Do you think you'll continue the last airbender watch along,

2024
02:39:36,840 --> 02:39:38,840
or did it not really grab your interest?

2025
02:39:38,840 --> 02:39:39,840
I don't know.

2026
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:43,840
I, I feel like, I don't know.

2027
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:47,840
I'm, I guess I'm just, I didn't, I don't, I just have this feeling

2028
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:50,840
that, like, other people don't care about watch alongs.

2029
02:39:50,840 --> 02:39:57,840
I was like, I don't know if people want to see you.

2030
02:39:57,840 --> 02:40:00,840
I do the same with the community server.

2031
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:01,840
That's cute.

2032
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:03,840
That's nice that you guys have your own community.

2033
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:05,840
I'm happy about that.

2034
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:07,840
Don't, no, don't like discord.

2035
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:09,840
No, no, no, no.

2036
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:11,840
There is, there's not a T between us.

2037
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:14,840
Of course, like, I'm not going to be like,

2038
02:40:14,840 --> 02:40:16,840
I fucking hate this other member.

2039
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:20,840
Like, we're actually very, very, um, friendly with each other,

2040
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:25,840
which is, like, apparently not always the norm between companies

2041
02:40:25,840 --> 02:40:27,840
and, like, their members.

2042
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:32,840
Obviously, I won't be like, X person hates Y person in, in Z company,

2043
02:40:32,840 --> 02:40:39,840
but it's just like, um, like, I didn't know that, like,

2044
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:43,840
like, it's, it's not every company is so chill.

2045
02:40:43,840 --> 02:40:47,840
I didn't know.

2046
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:49,840
I hate scrawny.

2047
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:52,840
No.

2048
02:40:52,840 --> 02:40:53,840
We do care.

2049
02:40:53,840 --> 02:40:55,840
I was down for watch alongs.

2050
02:40:55,840 --> 02:40:59,840
Aw.

2051
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:02,840
Being work colleagues doesn't automatically make you friends.

2052
02:41:02,840 --> 02:41:03,840
Yeah.

2053
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:04,840
Yeah.

2054
02:41:04,840 --> 02:41:05,840
That's true.

2055
02:41:05,840 --> 02:41:06,840
And I'm glad we are friends.

2056
02:41:06,840 --> 02:41:12,840
I'm glad everyone in, um, dealer is friends because it didn't,

2057
02:41:12,840 --> 02:41:16,840
you know, it didn't guarantee us to, to be friends,

2058
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:20,840
but I'm glad that we all get along really well.

2059
02:41:20,840 --> 02:41:25,840
And I feel comfortable talking to all of the girls.

2060
02:41:25,840 --> 02:41:28,840
Like, I think every time we've had a collab together,

2061
02:41:28,840 --> 02:41:34,840
um, we've, we've, a lot of times, um, we were just staying in the call afterwards

2062
02:41:34,840 --> 02:41:38,840
and just talk after the collab for like a long time.

2063
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:45,840
I'm glad because I know you and scrawny both really wanted some Vtuber pals.

2064
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:46,840
Yeah.

2065
02:41:46,840 --> 02:41:48,840
I did.

2066
02:41:48,840 --> 02:41:49,840
I did.

2067
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:57,840
And I, I was always pretty like shy to reach out to people.

2068
02:41:57,840 --> 02:41:59,840
I reached out to someone today.

2069
02:41:59,840 --> 02:42:01,840
I was really, really scared.

2070
02:42:01,840 --> 02:42:03,840
I reached out to someone today on Twitter and,

2071
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:05,840
and they actually responded to me.

2072
02:42:06,840 --> 02:42:08,840
And I was so surprised that they did.

2073
02:42:08,840 --> 02:42:11,840
I was like, wow, they're talking to me.

2074
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:12,840
That's so surprising.

2075
02:42:12,840 --> 02:42:14,840
I'm getting braver.

2076
02:42:14,840 --> 02:42:17,840
I'm getting braver because I was, I wanted, I was going to wait.

2077
02:42:17,840 --> 02:42:19,840
I was like, oh, maybe, maybe they'll reach out to me.

2078
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:20,840
Right.

2079
02:42:20,840 --> 02:42:22,840
Then I was like, nah, nah, I should do it.

2080
02:42:22,840 --> 02:42:23,840
I should do it.

2081
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:24,840
Don't wait.

2082
02:42:24,840 --> 02:42:25,840
Don't wait.

2083
02:42:25,840 --> 02:42:26,840
Just do it.

2084
02:42:26,840 --> 02:42:27,840
And I did it.

2085
02:42:27,840 --> 02:42:28,840
And they responded.

2086
02:42:28,840 --> 02:42:29,840
Isn't that so exciting?

2087
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:30,840
It was so exciting to me.

2088
02:42:30,840 --> 02:42:34,840
I, I was really, I was like, oh, my heart was pumping.

2089
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:37,840
I'm proud of you for getting past the nurse.

2090
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:38,840
I'm happy it's going well.

2091
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:39,840
I'm happy too.

2092
02:42:39,840 --> 02:42:41,840
I was really scared.

2093
02:42:42,840 --> 02:42:46,840
I was super, super scared, but it went really well.

2094
02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:51,840
Only one I ever knew that was a clap.

2095
02:42:52,840 --> 02:42:56,840
Only one I ever knew that was a black company and a budget stuff coming out of

2096
02:42:56,840 --> 02:42:58,840
both behind the scenes bullying.

2097
02:42:59,840 --> 02:43:01,840
Do you mean Nishi Sanji?

2098
02:43:01,840 --> 02:43:02,840
Do you mean that one?

2099
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:08,840
Should I not talk bad about Nishi Sanji?

2100
02:43:08,840 --> 02:43:09,840
I don't know.

2101
02:43:09,840 --> 02:43:12,840
Are we going to get blacklisted from, from collabing with Nishi Sanji?

2102
02:43:12,840 --> 02:43:13,840
That's okay.

2103
02:43:16,840 --> 02:43:17,840
Yeah.

2104
02:43:18,840 --> 02:43:21,840
I think, I think we all kind of know that.

2105
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:22,840
I got a necklace.

2106
02:43:22,840 --> 02:43:23,840
Okay.

2107
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:24,840
Bye.

2108
02:43:24,840 --> 02:43:25,840
Have fun.

2109
02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:27,840
Nishi stuff is pretty open.

2110
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:28,840
Yeah.

2111
02:43:28,840 --> 02:43:29,840
Everyone knows about that.

2112
02:43:29,840 --> 02:43:30,840
That's already out.

2113
02:43:30,840 --> 02:43:32,840
That's already been out.

2114
02:43:32,840 --> 02:43:34,840
Don't be afraid to reach out in me.

2115
02:43:34,840 --> 02:43:37,840
Anyone who takes 10 seconds to watch your content knows how fun you are.

2116
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:41,840
Yeah, but not everyone, you know, has time to watch my content,

2117
02:43:41,840 --> 02:43:43,840
so they might not want to, um,

2118
02:43:44,840 --> 02:43:46,840
see how based in real I am.

2119
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:48,840
So,

2120
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:50,840
yeah,

2121
02:43:50,840 --> 02:43:51,840
but that's okay.

2122
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:52,840
That's okay.

2123
02:43:52,840 --> 02:43:54,840
That's, that's fine too.

2124
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:56,840
Not everyone has to,

2125
02:43:56,840 --> 02:43:59,840
I don't, I don't expect everyone to, to reply to me.

2126
02:44:00,840 --> 02:44:03,840
But I'm happy when they do.

2127
02:44:04,840 --> 02:44:06,840
Like I talked to Lulu yesterday.

2128
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:08,840
Like I said before, I was so surprised.

2129
02:44:08,840 --> 02:44:10,840
Lulu sounds so cute.

2130
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:13,840
Lulu is so cute sounding.

2131
02:44:13,840 --> 02:44:15,840
When I heard her, I was like, holy crap.

2132
02:44:16,840 --> 02:44:17,840
Lulu, how old are you?

2133
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:22,840
I was like, one of the first questions I asked her, I was like,

2134
02:44:22,840 --> 02:44:25,840
are you, are you a kid?

2135
02:44:25,840 --> 02:44:27,840
But no, she's, she's not.

2136
02:44:30,840 --> 02:44:31,840
She's not.

2137
02:44:33,840 --> 02:44:34,840
Um,

2138
02:44:34,840 --> 02:44:38,840
just want, just didn't want to say the name because it was like forbidden by YouTube.

2139
02:44:38,840 --> 02:44:40,840
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2140
02:44:41,840 --> 02:44:44,840
Yeah, I'm glad the others are, are in a better place now too,

2141
02:44:44,840 --> 02:44:46,840
in, in the show, Jill.

2142
02:44:47,840 --> 02:44:49,840
What's the worst that can happen if you reach out though?

2143
02:44:49,840 --> 02:44:50,840
They say no thanks and that's it.

2144
02:44:50,840 --> 02:44:52,840
Um, the worst that can happen is they block me.

2145
02:44:53,840 --> 02:44:55,840
And I don't want to get blocked.

2146
02:44:55,840 --> 02:44:58,840
I just need to watch your tooting short.

2147
02:44:58,840 --> 02:45:00,840
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

2148
02:45:02,840 --> 02:45:04,840
Don't, if you're going to watch a short, don't watch that one.

2149
02:45:04,840 --> 02:45:06,840
Watch a better one.

2150
02:45:06,840 --> 02:45:07,840
I don't know which one to watch.

2151
02:45:07,840 --> 02:45:09,840
Maybe like the rat one.

2152
02:45:09,840 --> 02:45:11,840
The rat one is really good.

2153
02:45:12,840 --> 02:45:13,840
That one's a good one to watch.

2154
02:45:13,840 --> 02:45:15,840
Don't watch the one where I pooped.

2155
02:45:15,840 --> 02:45:19,840
Surely, surely no one is that insanely block you for reaching out.

2156
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:20,840
I don't know.

2157
02:45:20,840 --> 02:45:21,840
Maybe they are.

2158
02:45:21,840 --> 02:45:24,840
I think about the worst possible outcome, you know?

2159
02:45:24,840 --> 02:45:32,960
that's the worst possible outcome or they like screenshot the dm and they

2160
02:45:32,960 --> 02:45:40,440
post it and they're like look who dm'd me look who tried to DM me how how

2161
02:45:40,440 --> 02:45:47,800
desperate I don't know like I think of the worst possible situation and I um I

2162
02:45:47,800 --> 02:45:53,760
get scared and this it scares me and it stops me from reaching out if they do

2163
02:45:53,760 --> 02:46:00,440
they have issues I know and if they do that I probably didn't wanna you know I

2164
02:46:00,440 --> 02:46:06,920
probably wouldn't want to interact with them in the first place I know would you

2165
02:46:06,920 --> 02:46:10,680
even want to collab with someone who'd be so petty they'd block you for reaching
