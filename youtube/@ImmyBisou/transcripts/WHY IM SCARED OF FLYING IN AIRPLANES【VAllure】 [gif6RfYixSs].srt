00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hi!

2
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Hello, I'm back!

3
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,440
Oh my god, I'm back!

4
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,000
Hi!

5
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,940
That's good to know.

6
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,940
Hiiii!

7
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,940
Hellooooo!

8
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,940
I'm back!

9
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,940
Oh my god, I'm back from being banned on YouTube!

10
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,940
I'm back from being banned on YouTube!

11
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,940
Hello!

12
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,940
For, um, chewing on the ears.

13
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,940
Wa wa!

14
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,940
Thank you for watching!

15
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,940
Wa wa!

16
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,940
Thank you for, uh, the membership.

17
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,940
The best little ginger-

18
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,940
The best little ginger sister, Imi, is back.

19
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,940
You're never allowed to leave again, understood?

20
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,940
Big bro will cry if you're gone too long?

21
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,940
It wasn't my fault!

22
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,940
It wasn't my fault!

23
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,940
It wasn't my fault!

24
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,940
Okay?

25
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,940
I thought chewing on the ears would be okay.

26
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,940
I thought it would be okay.

27
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,940
Welcome back, Travelmaker.

28
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,940
Mmmmmm...

29
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,940
Did you spank Esteban?

30
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,940
I didn't know.

31
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,940
It's been so long, uh, something, something.

32
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,940
This is behind the slaughter.

33
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,940
What?

34
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,940
Are you talking about Five Nights at Freddy's?

35
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,940
Thank you for all the membership.

36
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,940
Missed you glad you're back.

37
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,940
I'm so happy to be back.

38
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,940
I got punished!

39
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,940
I'm so happy to be back.

40
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,940
I'm so happy to be back.

41
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:44,460
I got punished by YouTube. I mean, I wasn't gonna stream much anyways because my cousin was over.

42
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,300
Oh my god, thank you for all the memberships. Holy shit. Holy shit.

43
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,860
Frick JonTube, yeah. JonTube? What?

44
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,420
Welcome back. Punishment time for me?

45
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,580
Maybe later in a few days.

46
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,500
How do I have days? So I'm thankful for you and the pin pals. I love you so much. Kiss, kiss.

47
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Oh, you did so good waiting for me. Thank you for waiting. Thank you.

48
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Missed you so much. I missed you too. I missed you so much. I'm so happy I'm back.

49
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,500
Thank you for all the memberships. Thank you for renewing them and stuff.

50
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Longest week ever. For me too, man, I did so much in like such a little amount of time.

51
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Oh, thank you for the five minutes. What do people call these on YouTube memberships?

52
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,500
The five minutes. The gifted. Gifted. Thank you for the five gifted.

53
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,500
You have no idea how much I missed you. You're never allowed to leave again.

54
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,500
I'll, I'll try not to. I'll be on my best behavior on YouTube.

55
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:04,500
I'll be on my best behavior because I can, I can, I can do other stuff on other websites now.

56
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Felt like a month. I know it felt like a month for me too.

57
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,500
It felt like a month for me too.

58
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,500
I hated waiting. I hated it.

59
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Keep, keep the sauce on brosley. We don't ever, so we don't ever lose you on YouTube.

60
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,500
I'll keep it on brosley. It's funny how you call it brosley. I've never called it brosley.

61
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Oh yeah, I forgot. Thank you for 30K.

62
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Thank you for 30K. Holy crap. I like, it just happened while I was gone.

63
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,500
I had a goal of 30K for a month and a half.

64
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Or I guess a month now because it's already been half a month. I wanted to hit 30K in a month.

65
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Why are you acting so gay?

66
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,500
I'm not a messed up $10. Welcome back, Emmy.

67
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Thank you. Thank you for the $10. Thank you. I'm happy to be back.

68
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Um, just gifted zero memberships. What? Why did I say that? Is that a glitch?

69
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,500
50K next? I mean, eventually.

70
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Wait, did I read that wrong?

71
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Wait, why did it say zero memberships for me?

72
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Oh, five. Thank you for the five. Okay, I said that already. Sorry. The notifications are, um, are delayed.

73
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Okay, almost at 35K. We are. I mean, don't go to 50K next. We gotta reach 40K first.

74
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,500
But I don't know, I don't know if, um, I don't know if we'll get there.

75
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Also chat is broken. I don't know why. I think it's broken for other streamers too.

76
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,500
I remember seeing something like that in our server. They talked about how it was broken.

77
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Oh, yeah. Um, hello, little Emmy. It's an honor to meet you and your pin pals.

78
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,500
I'm new around here. I wanted to say hello. I'm new to Vealert. Hello, welcome to Vealert.

79
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,500
I hope you have fun here. We're an interesting bunch, for sure.

80
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Chat's been buggy this week. Yeah.

81
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,500
It has been. I don't know how to fix it yet, so we're just not gonna have chat.

82
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Yep. Yep. They specifically did it because of me. They wanted to punish me.

83
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,500
They wanted to take away my chat privileges, but they couldn't do that because then that would be show...

84
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,500
What's the opposite of favoritism? Hateism. Hating.

85
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,500
They hate me specifically and they wanted to punish me, but they already gave me a strike.

86
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,500
So they were like, you know what, let's just take away chat too.

87
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Love you forever. Oh, I love you too. Thank you.

88
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Dude, that's wholesome right here.

89
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:15,500
You should check out Strawny if you like dude, that's wholesome. I heard that they sound similar.

90
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Disfavoritism. Yeah. Hateism. I don't know.

91
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Prejudice. They're prejudiced against me specifically.

92
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Okay. I'm so tired. I've had a rough fucking week.

93
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,500
I'm gonna lean back.

94
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,500
I've had a rough week because I like...

95
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:46,500
I went to multiple cities and to like multiple attractions and like...

96
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,500
I should lean forward. I don't want to lean forward.

97
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:58,500
And like theme parks and stuff. So like, I'm really tired.

98
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:05,500
It's been a really long trip and yeah. Kind of a tour guide. A little bit.

99
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Do you still have monsters? I don't. I drank them all a long time ago.

100
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,500
I'm not the only one who thinks they sound the same. Yeah, a lot of...

101
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,500
A lot of people think Strawny and dude, that's wholesome sound the same.

102
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Has it been a roller coaster? It has been. Both emotionally and physically and also...

103
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,500
I've been on roller coasters.

104
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,500
I guess I can tell you a bit about the trip.

105
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,500
You're not allowed to leave us again for the whole year. I'll try...

106
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
Oh, here.

107
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,500
It's like coming back to your Animal Crossing Island. Calls you a slur. Love you and me.

108
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,500
It's been two years and three weeks and ten days.

109
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Alright, wait. And six days.

110
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Because ten days is another week. Right? Yeah, yeah.

111
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Did you enjoy yourself?

112
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:19,500
I had moments where I enjoyed myself, but I also had moments where I really, really, really wasn't having fun.

113
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,500
So it was like a mix of both, kind of.

114
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,500
That doesn't make any sense. Strawny has an accent and dude, that's wholesome, doesn't it?

115
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,500
They cannot sound the same.

116
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
He's lacking critical information.

117
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Um, anyways.

118
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Two years, three months, three weeks and six days!

119
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,500
I'm sorry to hear you having a rough time. If you're alright, I'll gladly...

120
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,500
me another big bro to add the c- to the f- I can't read.

121
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,500
You sound like you need more brothers.

122
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,500
I only have one brother and it's you.

123
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Did you drink at all? No, I didn't drink while I was out there.

124
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,500
I'll tell you why I'm afraid of planes, but that...

125
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,500
I want to talk to you first a little bit. We gotta catch up a little bit first.

126
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:14,500
It's been ten days since I last streamed, really? Holy crap.

127
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
That feels really long.

128
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Um...

129
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Um, so...

130
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Basically, I, um...

131
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,500
So, I wasn't the only tour guide, right?

132
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,500
My cousin came, you know, to visit us.

133
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,500
But, um, I, we, we all went.

134
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Me, my cousin, um, my uncle, and his girlfriend, and his girlfriend's friend.

135
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
We all went together!

136
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,500
So, um...

137
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Like, we all went together to go places.

138
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,500
I wasn't, you know, I wasn't driving around or anything because I didn't know how to drive.

139
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,500
So, it was kind of like, um...

140
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,500
It was a lot of people, and I don't know...

141
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,500
I don't know my uncle's girlfriend very well, and I don't know...

142
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,500
I didn't know at all my uncle's girlfriend's friend!

143
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,500
So, um, I...

144
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:23,500
It was kind of awkward a little bit, and so I made sure to get a separate hotel room from them because I was like...

145
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,500
It'll, it'll, it'll, you know, um...

146
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,500
I'll avoid some of the awkwardness, and also, um...

147
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:39,500
Also, um, like, my uncle and his girlfriend smokes a lot.

148
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Like, a lot, and they were smoking in the car the whole time,

149
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:50,500
and I was like, I am absolutely not staying in a hotel room with you guys because you're gonna smoke in the fucking hotel room.

150
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,500
And, um, like, I think I tweeted about it.

151
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,500
I was like, I fucking hate people who smoke!

152
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,500
I did tweet about it.

153
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Oh, hold on, I have to open...

154
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Thank you for the $4.20.

155
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
Let me open it.

156
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
I should write in the description somewhere.

157
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,500
TTS only activates for $5 an app.

158
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,500
I really need to write that somewhere, so people know.

159
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
Uh...

160
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Hey, Amy, I know Poppy Playtime has been pissing you off.

161
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
How about a new horror game?

162
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,500
I've been seeing YouTubers play FNAF into the pit,

163
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
and it looks easier to play than Poppy Playtime.

164
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
I'm actually already playing that next week.

165
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
Fuck, I keep doing that frog blank, man.

166
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,500
I mean, I still haven't fixed that frog blank.

167
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Ahem, yeah.

168
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Um, we're playing Poppy Playtime next week.

169
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Not Poppy Playtime.

170
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,500
We're playing Five Nights at Freddy's into the pit next week already.

171
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
I already, I already, um...

172
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Fuck, I did it again! What the fuck?!

173
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Fuck!

174
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Um...

175
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Keep the frog blank?

176
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
I think it looks bad, though.

177
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,500
I already, I already plan to do that, yeah.

178
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
In the description should be good.

179
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
I have to update, like, my default description.

180
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Yeah.

181
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,500
I used to smoke but quit since that shit got way too expensive.

182
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,500
It is, it is expensive.

183
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,500
But they, not only do they smoke, um...

184
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Sorry, I'm rubbing my eye, hold on.

185
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
I have something in my eye.

186
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Um, not only do they smoke, like, cigarettes,

187
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,500
but they smoke the devil's lettuce!

188
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
They smoke the devil's lettuce, like, okay.

189
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,500
And, um, it smells really bad to me,

190
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
and it makes me, like, nauseous.

191
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
And also, you still have a debut in your description?

192
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,500
I know.

193
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
I think that's supposed to be there, though.

194
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
I don't know.

195
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
They smoke kale.

196
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
And it smells really bad to me,

197
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,500
and, um, my, my uncle's girlfriend

198
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,500
was, like, trying to pressure my cousin into,

199
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
into smoking with her.

200
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
And it was kind of awkward,

201
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,500
because it's like, my cousin obviously didn't want to,

202
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,500
but she was the only other, like, person...

203
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
Thank you for becoming a member.

204
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
Two months, I know!

205
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
It's been two months!

206
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Yippee!

207
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Um, but she was the only person

208
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,500
that my, um, uncle's girlfriend, like, knew

209
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
would be open to smoking,

210
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
because it's kind of funny.

211
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,500
We were in the car, and, um, I don't know.

212
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
We were talking about something,

213
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
and my uncle was like,

214
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,500
oh, yeah, Amy thinks people who smoke weed are losers,

215
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,500
and I was like, yeah, I do, actually, yeah.

216
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,500
And then his girlfriend turned around,

217
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
and she was like, huh?

218
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Wait, wait, what?

219
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
And then I was like, oh, wait, wait, wait.

220
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
No, I don't mean you're a loser.

221
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,500
I don't mean you're a loser.

222
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,500
I just mean, I just mean there's a correlation.

223
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
I'm sorry.

224
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Anyone who smokes weed here,

225
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,500
I kind of defended you, I'm sorry.

226
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,500
It's just, it's just a correlation between...

227
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Listen, okay, I've been around smokers my entire life,

228
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,500
and I'm tired of it, so I...

229
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,500
I've gotten to a point where I get really annoyed at this point

230
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,500
about it, especially when it's like...

231
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,500
I don't know, you can't wait until, like, we get to, um...

232
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,500
Like, you can't wait until we get to, like, a stop.

233
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,500
You have to do it in the car with us.

234
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Like, you can't wait until we get to the hotel.

235
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
You can't wait until we're outside.

236
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
You know what I mean?

237
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Like, you have to do it with me here.

238
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
I don't know.

239
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
It annoyed me a lot, so, yeah.

240
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
That's something that I hate.

241
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,500
What's your thoughts on people drinking?

242
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Um...

243
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,500
I mean, obviously, excessively is bad, but drinking doesn't...

244
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:09,500
It, like, someone drinking near me doesn't make me feel nauseous, you know?

245
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,500
So it's like, whatever, you can drink near me or just...

246
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
You can drink near me or around me.

247
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Just don't bother me about it, like, you know?

248
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Just don't do it excessively, like, a lot and often.

249
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Welcome back.

250
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
We missed you.

251
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
Looking forward to some quality time with this this week to make up for it.

252
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
I'll try.

253
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
I'll try.

254
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Um...

255
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
So, yeah, I don't mind drunk driving yet.

256
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Also, don't do it while you're driving, of course.

257
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
Of course.

258
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
It's so jover.

259
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
My sister hates me.

260
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
I'm sorry.

261
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Why are you acting so gay?

262
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
I know how you feel in me.

263
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,500
All my siblings and all my cousins smoke except...

264
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Everyone except me.

265
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,500
I even once cut my parents with some edibles once after a New Year's party.

266
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Accidentally ate one and had the trip of my life.

267
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Mmm.

268
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
I haven't...

269
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
I've tried an edible before, too.

270
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Uh-oh.

271
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
I didn't feel anything, though.

272
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
So, I was okay.

273
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
But it was just, um...

274
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Like, yeah.

275
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
It's not even just, like, you know, family.

276
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
It's like...

277
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Like...

278
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
It is family.

279
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Yeah, it is family.

280
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
But it was like, ever since I was like a baby.

281
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,500
Like, I've lived with people smoking in my house.

282
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,500
And so, now that I moved out, I have, like, no more tolerance for it.

283
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Because I hated it so much as a kid.

284
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
And I finally...

285
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,500
I finally had a taste of freedom!

286
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,500
And clear lungs!

287
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
This edible ain't shit!

288
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Yeah.

289
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Um...

290
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
This week has banger streams, really?

291
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Does it?

292
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
That's good.

293
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
Raise hell.

294
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Praise Dale.

295
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
If you ain't drunk, you ain't driving.

296
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,500
What does that mean?

297
00:19:53,500 --> 00:20:01,500
The only kind of drunk driving that I encourage is drunk driving in Mario Kart.

298
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,500
No one wants to secondhand smoke two packs a day.

299
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Exactly.

300
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Ah, real.

301
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Real and true.

302
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,500
It's so bad when you smoke you don't realize how bad it is until you quit.

303
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,500
I mean, I don't realize that all because I never did.

304
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,500
But, um, it does get really bad and stinky, yeah.

305
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
But what else we...

306
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
So we went to a theme park?

307
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,500
I was so pissed about this.

308
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Okay, so my uncle texted me and he was like, you know,

309
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
can you buy the tickets for the theme park?

310
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
And I was like, sure!

311
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,500
I'll buy the tickets for the theme park, right?

312
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
I texted back.

313
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
I'm like, I want to get fast passes.

314
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,500
I want to get fast passes for the people that want to go on rides.

315
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Because, fuck, I keep doing that frog blink.

316
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
I don't know why.

317
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Let me turn down my lighting, maybe.

318
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,500
I want to get fast passes for the people that want to go on rides.

319
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Because every time I've ever been to a theme park,

320
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,500
I had to wait in line like the rest of the losers.

321
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,500
And this time, I have enough money to not do that.

322
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,500
So, I tell him, I'm like, okay.

323
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
Who wants a fast pass?

324
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Who should I get a fast pass for, right?

325
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,500
And he says, um, his girlfriend?

326
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Obviously me, because I want one.

327
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
And my cousin, right?

328
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
And I'm like, cool, okay.

329
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,500
I'll get a fast pass for all three of us.

330
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Yeah, who waits in line like a loser, exactly.

331
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
I do.

332
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
I always do.

333
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,500
But, um, I do that, right?

334
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
I do that.

335
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,500
I spend like a crazy amount of money on tickets,

336
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,500
because it's like a popular theme park.

337
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,500
And, um, we get there, right?

338
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,500
We get there, okay?

339
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,500
My cousin goes on one big ride.

340
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
They have multiple big rides,

341
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,500
but she goes on one big ride, right, with us.

342
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,500
And, uh, my uncle doesn't go on any rides,

343
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
because he's scared of them.

344
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
But his girlfriend likes ride.

345
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
So, likes big rides, right?

346
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
And I'm okay with them, too.

347
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
So, my cousin goes on one big ride with us,

348
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,500
all the way at the start of our visit to this theme park.

349
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
And then she's like, I'm done.

350
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
I don't want to do this anymore.

351
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
I can't do this anymore.

352
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,500
I, I, and so the rest of the time,

353
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,500
it's literally just me and my uncle's girlfriend

354
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
going on every single ride together.

355
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,500
I don't even know this girl that well.

356
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,500
But it's just me and her going on rides together.

357
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,500
And it's just, and my, my uncle and my cousin

358
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
are just like following us around,

359
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
because my uncle never intended to go on rides,

360
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,500
because he's scared.

361
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,500
But my cousin, like, why did I get a fast pass for her?

362
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
I was so pissed, because, like, it was like,

363
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
it was a lot of money.

364
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,500
I'm not gonna, it was, it was, it was, I was so pissed.

365
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,500
I was so pissed.

366
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Because the only one she ended up going on

367
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
was at the end of the day,

368
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
after we had already, after me and,

369
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,500
and my uncle's girlfriend already went on all the big rides

370
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
and we were like tuckered out and we were like,

371
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
okay, the, the theme park is closing soon.

372
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,500
So, you know, we should get ready to leave.

373
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,500
You know those, those spinning teacup rides?

374
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Those spinning teacup rides?

375
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Um, she went on those at the end of the day.

376
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,500
That's the second ride she went on.

377
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,500
That's all.

378
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
I went on them with her, too.

379
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,500
And my uncle got the, he, he grew the balls to go

380
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
on the spinning teacup, too.

381
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,500
So that was nice.

382
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Um, I mean, wait, please tell me you spun it

383
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
as hard as you could.

384
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
No, they don't have, they didn't have the wheels

385
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
to spin it yourself.

386
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Um, it just automatically spins.

387
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,500
It went pretty fast, but, um, it was,

388
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,500
it just, it just, like, you can't control the speed of it.

389
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
A little baby went on the teacups.

390
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,500
I know I should have, I should have teased her for it more.

391
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,500
I should have.

392
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
I'm also bad when it comes to rides,

393
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
but only the spinning teacups is crazy.

394
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
I know.

395
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,500
It wasn't, it wasn't, was it 150 or 300 for fast passes?

396
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,500
I'm not going to tell you guys,

397
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,500
but it was somewhere between those two numbers.

398
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Let's just say that.

399
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,500
It was definitely between those two numbers.

400
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:25,500
Um, you'll really let the brat chances pass you by.

401
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
What brat chances?

402
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Like to, to tease her for it.

403
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,500
And, um, you know, not make fun of her enough

404
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,500
for, for being a little fuzzy.

405
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,500
And what's crazy is they wanted to go skydiving the next day.

406
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,500
My cousin was going to go skydiving the next day.

407
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,500
With my, with my uncle's girlfriend,

408
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
they were both going skydiving.

409
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
She wasn't afraid to go skydiving,

410
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,500
but she was afraid to go on roller coasters.

411
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,500
And I was so confused because I was like,

412
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
you're going to jump from like,

413
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,500
I don't fucking know, 10,000 feet in the air.

414
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,500
And you're, you're afraid to go on a roller coaster

415
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,500
that doesn't even get any close to that high in the air.

416
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
You know what I mean?

417
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,500
Like, I don't know.

418
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,500
It was just kind of like, is it,

419
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
is it because she's scared of the ride malfunctioning?

420
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
She did say that she didn't trust the machinery,

421
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,500
but at the same time it's like, you trust a parachute?

422
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
You don't trust, you don't trust a roller coaster,

423
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
but you trust a parachute?

424
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,500
Like, that's gross.

425
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,500
I don't know.

426
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
She's very strange.

427
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
She's a very strange person for sure.

428
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,500
I had fun with her, but it was definitely,

429
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,500
there were definitely times where she's, she's strange,

430
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,500
and I had to kind of be the person to like...

431
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,500
I'm going to need revoke your brat license.

432
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
No, don't revoke it.

433
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,500
I'll act like a brat.

434
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
Just, just give me some time.

435
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,500
I need to get back in my bratty mood.

436
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
To be fair, skydiving and roller coasters

437
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,500
have entirely different g-force directions.

438
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
I don't know.

439
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,500
Are you gay?

440
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Why are you acting so gay?

441
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,500
Um, I feel like if Big Bro took me to a theme park,

442
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
she would probably do some magic on your wand

443
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,500
while we rode the ferris wheel.

444
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Absolutely not!

445
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
They have cameras in there!

446
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
They have cameras in the ferris wheel!

447
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
They can see you doing that!

448
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,500
And they'll, they'll, they'll tell you on the microphone,

449
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,500
hey, we can see you, please stop.

450
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,500
Um...

451
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Maybe she was feeling like puking?

452
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,500
I don't think that was the case.

453
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Skydiving and roller coasters...

454
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Oh wait, I already read that.

455
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
You do have two extra shoots for backup.

456
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,500
I thought you only had one extra.

457
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
I don't know.

458
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
I'll trust a roller coaster over a parachute any day.

459
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Me too!

460
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
Me too!

461
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,500
Like, even if it does get stuck somewhere,

462
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,500
like, you're still, you probably won't get stuck upside down.

463
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
I know if, I know what's happened where people have gotten

464
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,500
stuck upside down during a roller coaster,

465
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,500
but you probably, if, like, most roller coasters

466
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
only go upside down for, like, a short amount of time,

467
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,500
and then they, like, you know,

468
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
they go, like, up and down and stuff, right?

469
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
Like, if somehow it malfunctions

470
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
and maybe it stops moving,

471
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,500
you'll probably just get stuck, like, in a normal position,

472
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
you know?

473
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,500
Or, like, I guess the worst-case scenario is that it, like,

474
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,500
you know, detach, like, the cart detaches from the, um,

475
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
from the rails and you go flying.

476
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,500
And sure, sure you might die, sure,

477
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
but I feel like you're, you had a,

478
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,500
you have a higher chance of dying during skydiving anyways.

479
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Speaking of puke wins the audio, what fucking audio?

480
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
I'm not, uh, puking audio?

481
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
What do you mean?

482
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,500
When you're flying, you have a chance to hit rock bottom.

483
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
What do you mean, rock bottom?

484
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:07,500
There's more than just cameras stopping me.

485
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
There's more than just cameras.

486
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,500
Um...

487
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
My harness came unlocked once,

488
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
and that's why I don't dress them no more.

489
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,500
Like, roller coasters or skydiving.

490
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,500
My harness came unlocked once, too,

491
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
while I was on a roller coaster.

492
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
I ended up fine, though.

493
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,500
Like, usually, um,

494
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
because that's why they have two seatbelts, you know?

495
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,500
They have, like, the one that goes across your hips

496
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
and then they have the one that goes,

497
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
um, above you, you know?

498
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,500
I can't believe you muted during that stream.

499
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
Oh, where I puked, sorry.

500
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,500
I don't automatically assume that people want to hear me puke.

501
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
I'm really sorry about that.

502
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,500
Okay, um...

503
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
What else?

504
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
We went to...

505
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,500
We went to, like, a sports game.

506
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,500
We went to some sports game,

507
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
because my cousin's into sports,

508
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
so I was like,

509
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,500
sure, I'll come with you and watch this sports game.

510
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Even though I don't really care about it,

511
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,500
I came with her, and it was just meh.

512
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
I don't know.

513
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,500
I didn't have any sort of...

514
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
I kind of just sat there with her,

515
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,500
and then, like,

516
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,500
we initially got, like, tickets that were really shitty,

517
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,500
but she's like,

518
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,500
follow me.

519
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,500
I've done this before.

520
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,500
And she, like, leads me to where, like, there's better seating,

521
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,500
and she, like, waits until the, like, staff

522
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,500
guarding the seat, like, thing,

523
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
guarding the...

524
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
I don't know, guarding the entrance to those seats,

525
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
like, walks away,

526
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,500
and she, like, sneaks us into better seats.

527
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,500
Which was nice.

528
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Watch men play with a ball.

529
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,500
No.

530
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,500
It was, like, a woman's sports game.

531
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,500
It wasn't...

532
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,500
It wasn't a men's sports event.

533
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,500
I know, what a couple of delinquents.

534
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,500
I know.

535
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,500
We were breaking the law together over there.

536
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Good thing we didn't get caught.

537
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Someone would have called the police on us.

538
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,500
And then, um, what else did we do?

539
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
No, no, we just went to, like, attractions.

540
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
It was kind of annoying because we had to, like,

541
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
wait in line for tickets,

542
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
and it was really busy,

543
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
because it was, like, a weekend.

544
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,500
Um...

545
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
We did go to an escape room,

546
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,500
which was nice.

547
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
That was really cool.

548
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
We went to an escape room.

549
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,500
So, like, my, um...

550
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
What's it called?

551
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
Um...

552
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,500
My uncle, like, had to work the next day,

553
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,500
so he only stayed with us in that city

554
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
for a little bit,

555
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
and then he left.

556
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
He left.

557
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,500
And we had to find our way home alone,

558
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
which was fine.

559
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,500
I've done that before.

560
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
So, um...

561
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,500
We did an escape room together,

562
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,500
like, 30 minutes before we had to catch the bus to leave,

563
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
and that was really stressful,

564
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
because we were trying to finish the escape room

565
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
before we had to leave,

566
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
and we actually managed to do it,

567
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,500
and it was really fun.

568
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
I really wanted to do an escape room again,

569
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,500
because that's the first time I ever did it,

570
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
and every time I, like...

571
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Every time I managed to solve a puzzle,

572
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,500
I was like,

573
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
ah, so smart.

574
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
She never escaped from there.

575
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,500
I did escape.

576
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
I did escape.

577
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
We managed to escape, um,

578
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
in time to catch the bus.

579
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,500
Barely, barely.

580
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
The Uber driver was, like, speeding

581
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,500
to get us to the bus station in time,

582
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,500
but we managed to catch it.

583
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
You can't even beat the puzzles in Poppy Playtime?

584
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Okay, well, I beat a lot of the puzzles

585
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
in the escape room.

586
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,500
I just...

587
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
It's the pressure of having people watch me,

588
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,500
you know, while I'm playing Poppy Playtime,

589
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
but I didn't have anyone watching me

590
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
while I was doing the escape room puzzles,

591
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,500
so I was fine.

592
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
And I was smart.

593
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
Like I always am when you're not watching.

594
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
It's just a clone, really.

595
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,500
I mean, you're still trapped in the escape room.

596
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,500
The difference between your puzzle abilities,

597
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
IRL, and during games is amazing.

598
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
That's true, too.

599
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
That's true, too, because I don't really play puzzle games,

600
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
so I'm not used to playing them,

601
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,500
but, like, I can do puzzles in real life.

602
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,500
Yeah, it's the streamer debuff.

603
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Exactly.

604
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
It's just the streamer debuff.

605
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Um...

606
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,500
I'm gonna keep this stream a little shorter, though.

607
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,500
I have some bad news to give you.

608
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
I don't want to give you the bad news.

609
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
Um, I'll keep it short.

610
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
I'll keep it short and sweet.

611
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
So, um...

612
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Esplan had surgery recently,

613
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,500
and, um, she's not...

614
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,500
She was initially doing okay,

615
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,500
but she deteriorated, like, really fast.

616
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Um...

617
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,500
She's still alive,

618
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,500
but she's not doing good,

619
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
so I'm really worried about her,

620
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,500
and I don't want to be away from her very long.

621
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,500
I've been, like, sitting with her on my chest,

622
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
like a little baby.

623
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,500
She's so, um...

624
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,500
Why are you acting so gay?

625
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
I'll thank you for the $1.

626
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Does that mean we're...

627
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,500
When we're watching you on Brosly,

628
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,500
you're gonna get stage fright?

629
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,500
Does that mean when we're watching you on Brosly,

630
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,500
you're gonna get stage fright?

631
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,500
Yeah, of course!

632
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,500
Of course.

633
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Of course I'm gonna have stage fright.

634
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
Yes, I will be nervous.

635
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,500
Yeah, I've been, like, sitting with her, um,

636
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
on my chest and just, like, petting her.

637
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
I am worried about her.

638
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,500
I don't like to be away from her for long.

639
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,500
So, yeah.

640
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
I did go to the vet again, yeah.

641
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
She, um, he gave...

642
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,500
He gave me some medicine.

643
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,500
She has to take, like, three different medications.

644
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
Um...

645
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Yeah.

646
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
I'm worried about her.

647
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
Um, let me pull up my...

648
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,500
presentation.

649
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
I don't know how to make it fullscreen.

650
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
Is it?

651
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
Okay, wait, if I...

652
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,500
Mmm, I don't like that.

653
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,500
I'm just trying to figure out

654
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
how to show you my presentation here.

655
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Can I open it with...

656
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
Poopoo...

657
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
Poopoo Chrome?

658
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
No, I don't want to open it like that.

659
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Mmm.

660
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
I hope she pulls through.

661
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
I hope so, too.

662
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
I hope so, too.

663
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
What if I move...

664
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Mmm.

665
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,500
Mmm.

666
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,500
What if I move it here?

667
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Does that work?

668
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
No.

669
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
Let me try again.

670
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,500
Here it is.

671
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Okay.

672
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
There we go.

673
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
Can I make this fullscreen?

674
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500
Presents!

675
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
There we go!

676
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
Okay.

677
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
Um, since I haven't been here in long,

678
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
I don't know you had oolomark at March.

679
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
I bought an acrylic stand and I'm excited to get it.

680
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
Oh!

681
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500
I bought my merch, too.

682
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
For someone else, not even for me.

683
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
I didn't even buy my merch for myself.

684
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
I'm buying it for one of my friends.

685
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500
I'm not scared of flying in an airplane.

686
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,500
I'm scared of flying...

687
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,500
I'm trying to fly out of the airplane.

688
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,500
What does that mean?

689
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
Trying to fly out of the airplane?

690
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
I'm sorry to hear about Esteban.

691
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Hi, Amy. I've been watching your clips for the past few days.

692
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Oh, thank you.

693
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
Hello, hello.

694
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
I'm still waiting on my merch, too.

695
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
It hasn't been sent out.

696
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
This is the right thing.

697
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
I'm scared of being yeeted out of the airplane.

698
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
Me, too.

699
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,500
I'm scared of that, too.

700
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
Oh, oh.

701
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,500
Um...

702
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
I think...

703
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
Uh...

704
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
I mean, I meant to if I were 3,000 feet up,

705
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,500
I'd rather be on the inside of the plane than in...

706
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,500
I'd rather be on the inside of the plane

707
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
than inside.

708
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
You mean outside, right?

709
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
I'd rather be on the inside than the outside.

710
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
I'm scared of falling out of planes, too,

711
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
but that's not...

712
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
That's not the least of your worries

713
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
as you'll learn here in my presentation.

714
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
Alright.

715
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Here...

716
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
Here's my presentation.

717
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
Oh, you can't see...

718
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
Oh, fuck. Hold on.

719
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
Okay, there you can see...

720
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
You can see the plane's scary face.

721
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Look how scary he looks.

722
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Um, he's evil.

723
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,500
All planes are evil.

724
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
All airlines and planes are evil.

725
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,500
And don't get on one because you'll die if you do.

726
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
Okay.

727
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,500
Let me explain to you

728
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,500
why airplanes are the scariest, most terrifying,

729
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
horrific mode of transportation.

730
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
And I'm not being irrational.

731
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,500
I'm not being unrealistic.

732
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
I'm not being irrational.

733
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,500
I'm not being delusional.

734
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
I'm not being...

735
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
I'm being so...

736
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
real right now.

737
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
Not all planes, just the Boeing ones.

738
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,500
All planes. Every single one of them.

739
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,500
They're all evil.

740
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,500
That's what they want you to think, but they're all bad.

741
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,500
I'm not being paranoid. I swear I'm not being paranoid, okay?

742
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,500
Okay.

743
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
Statistically, roads should be scarier than skies.

744
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
Yeah, that's what you would think.

745
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
That's what they want you to think.

746
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Okay, that's what they've been telling you

747
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,500
so that you get on the plane.

748
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,500
But I'm going to tell you the truth right now.

749
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
Hold on. You know how Strani was wearing a...

750
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,500
Hold on.

751
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,500
You know how Strani was wearing a...

752
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,500
the tinfoil hat

753
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
and her thing?

754
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
I need to get myself a tinfoil hat.

755
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,500
Hold on.

756
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,500
Tinfoil hat.

757
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Can I get it?

758
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
Hat. PNG.

759
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
This is perfect.

760
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
Oh, it's so ugly.

761
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
That's not a real PNG.

762
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,500
I hate when they beat me with fake PNGs.

763
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
I hate when they beat me with fake PNGs.

764
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
Like the ones with a background,

765
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
but they have like the checkered background.

766
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
That's so stupid.

767
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500
Download.

768
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,500
Oh, I also hate when they

769
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,500
make me feel like the PNG is free,

770
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
but I actually have to pay for it.

771
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Just give me a free PNG of a tinfoil hat.

772
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
Is that so fucking hard?

773
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
Ahem.

774
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Is this one good?

775
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,500
I'm not going to allow ads.

776
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,500
No.

777
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
No, I'm not going to allow ads.

778
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
That one's so bad.

779
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,500
What about this one?

780
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Leave me alone.

781
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,500
Not allowing ads.

782
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
Okay, is this going to be a real PNG

783
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
or fake PNG?

784
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,500
Is this going to be a virus?

785
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
I want to download.

786
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,500
Let's see.

787
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
It's a real PNG.

788
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,500
Okay.

789
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,500
Let me put it on.

790
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,500
Um...

791
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,500
What the fuck?

792
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,500
No.

793
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,500
I'm bad with computers. Hold on.

794
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,500
Copy.

795
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Streaming assets.

796
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
Items.

797
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Okay.

798
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,500
They brainwashed you!

799
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,500
They brainwashed you all!

800
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Everyone in the aviation industry

801
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,500
that has been brainwashed,

802
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,500
and I'm going to tell you the real truth

803
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500
and I'm the only one you can trust.

804
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
Okay?

805
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Okay.

806
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
Okay, anyways, let me find

807
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
my tinfoil hat here.

808
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,500
That I put it in here.

809
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,500
Where is my tinfoil hat?

810
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
Are you shitting me?

811
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
Are you so bad at putting pictures into VTube Studio?

812
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,500
Oh, there it is.

813
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,500
Okay.

814
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,500
Perfect.

815
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,500
Perfect.

816
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,500
Are you ready?

817
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,500
Yeah, he's from Boeing.

818
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,500
He's sponsored by Boeing.

819
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,500
Don't trust him.

820
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,500
Don't trust what he says. Trust what I say.

821
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,500
All right.

822
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,500
Um, oh fuck.

823
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,500
Hold on, hold on, let me present it.

824
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,500
Okay.

825
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
Why airplanes are the scariest,

826
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,500
most terrifying, horrific mode of transportation

827
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,500
and I'm not being irrational? Are you ready?

828
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,500
Okay.

829
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,500
Oh fuck.

830
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,500
Okay, disclaimer.

831
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,500
This presentation is just for fun

832
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,500
and for comedic purposes.

833
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,500
Please don't try to argue with me

834
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,500
or disprove what I'm saying.

835
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
There are two facts and logic here.

836
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
Only vibes and planes have bad vibes.

837
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,500
If some of my info is wrong,

838
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,500
just pretend you didn't see it

839
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,500
because I didn't say it if it's wrong

840
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,500
because I'm never wrong, okay?

841
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,500
They're flying metal death tubes

842
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
that weigh hundreds of tons

843
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,500
and we're just meant to believe that they belong in the sky.

844
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,500
No, I don't buy it exactly.

845
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,500
That's the kind of

846
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
attitude I'm looking for

847
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,500
in chat, okay?

848
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,500
That's the kind of attitude

849
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,500
I'm looking for.

850
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,500
Is there chocolate under the tinfoil?

851
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,500
No, it's not a Hershey's kiss.

852
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
It's not a kiss.

853
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,500
Okay.

854
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,500
So here's my table of contents.

855
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,500
This is what we'll be going over.

856
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,500
Sorry, I know I'm really fucking,

857
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,500
I'm really fucking big here

858
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,500
but I tried to include some nice pictures

859
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,500
to keep your attention

860
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,500
because that's what they told me in school.

861
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,500
Whenever you're making a presentation,

862
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,500
you got to

863
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,500
make it attractive to the eye

864
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,500
so I did my best to do that.

865
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,500
Right, so I have my introduction

866
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,500
how it all started. You know how I started

867
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,500
disliking planes.

868
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,500
I'm going to disprove some lies

869
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,500
that airlines have told you.

870
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,500
Have made you believe.

871
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,500
They want you to think it's safe

872
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,500
because they want your money.

873
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,500
If everyone knew the truth about planes,

874
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,500
then airlines wouldn't be making

875
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,500
any money.

876
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,500
I'm going to tell you everything

877
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,500
that can go wrong.

878
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,500
Why are you acting so gay?

879
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,500
Well, I used to be run by engineers

880
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,500
who made sure that their planes worked

881
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,500
until they started being run by accountants

882
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,500
who cut corners on safety and maintenance

883
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,500
to save a few bucks. That's what I'm going to go into

884
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,500
actually.

885
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,500
That's exactly what I'm going to talk about.

886
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,500
Not specifically bowling,

887
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,500
but like in general,

888
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,500
like, yeah, cutting corners.

889
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,500
I'm sorry, I'm trying to

890
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,500
I'm trying to read the doughnos, but

891
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,500
I'm getting stuck on the

892
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,500
on the tab.

893
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,500
Hey, Amy,

894
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,500
what's the safest seat on the airplane?

895
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,500
I can tell you. You know why?

896
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,500
You've never seen an airplane

897
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,500
fly backwards into a mountain, have you?

898
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,500
No, I haven't. I was going to say that, yeah.

899
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
The safest seat on the airplanes

900
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,500
are the ones in the back and in the middle.

901
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
The back and the middle are the safest.

902
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,500
What was the other donation?

903
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,500
Thank you for the $10.

904
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,500
Just remember, Amy, planes disappear all the time

905
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,500
in Bermuda Triangle. I'm not trying to go on a flight in advantage.

906
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,500
Actually, the Bermuda Triangle

907
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,500
is fake and gay. I don't believe in the Bermuda Triangle,

908
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,500
but I do believe in planes disappearing

909
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,500
randomly.

910
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,500
Okay.

911
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
Um, okay.

912
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,500
Here's a table of contents and then finally,

913
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,500
I'm going to end on, um, you will die.

914
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,500
You will die.

915
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,500
If something goes wrong, you will die.

916
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,500
We're all going to die.

917
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Everyone.

918
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,500
Maybe like one or two people are going to survive, maybe.

919
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,500
But if something goes wrong, you're dead, okay?

920
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,500
And I'm going to tell you why.

921
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,500
Okay, here's my

922
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,500
introduction.

923
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,500
I...

924
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,500
I don't know why that emoji is gray.

925
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,500
It's yellow for me on my monitor.

926
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,500
I don't know why it's gray.

927
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,500
I'm going to ignore that.

928
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,500
Alright.

929
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,500
How it all started.

930
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,500
I got to move myself.

931
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,500
Right. How it all started.

932
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,500
So as a kid, I wasn't scared of airplanes.

933
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,500
I flew a lot as a kid, actually.

934
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,500
I was not afraid of them. I was not afraid of falling out of the air.

935
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,500
I was mostly okay.

936
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,500
Because I was stupid and I didn't know the truth yet.

937
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
I didn't know how dangerous they were.

938
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,500
I only really disliked them.

939
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,500
Because they make my ears hurt a lot.

940
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,500
And they still make my ears hurt to this day.

941
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Not as bad as when I was a kid,

942
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,500
but still really, really bad.

943
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,500
Um...

944
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,500
It's like the pressure change, right?

945
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,500
The pressure change makes your ears hurt.

946
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,500
Um...

947
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,500
And no, don't try to give me advice.

948
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
Oh, just chew on some candy. Just chew on some gum.

949
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,500
Chewing on anything doesn't help.

950
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,500
Blowing through my...

951
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,500
Blowing through my nose while plugging it doesn't help.

952
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,500
Sucking on candy doesn't help.

953
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,500
Nothing helps, okay?

954
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,500
Nothing helps me.

955
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,500
And that's why I hate it. It hurts.

956
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,500
The only thing that helps...

957
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,500
A tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny little bit

958
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,500
is yawning.

959
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
Yawning helps a teeny, tiny little bit.

960
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,500
And I'm constantly yawning on a plane.

961
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,500
And it makes my jaw hurt.

962
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,500
Because it's the only thing that helps.

963
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,500
And so I'm literally just sitting there like...

964
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,500
Like the whole time

965
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,500
on the plane because it hurts

966
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,500
so badly.

967
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,500
And I'm trying to get my ears to...

968
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,500
I don't know.

969
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,500
I don't know what you're supposed to stop

970
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,500
popping like that, you know?

971
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,500
Anyways,

972
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,500
one time when I was a kid,

973
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,500
I fell asleep while the plane was taking off.

974
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,500
Because I was so tired from flying on planes

975
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,500
because I can't sleep on planes.

976
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,500
That's another reason I hate them.

977
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,500
I didn't include this on the presentation,

978
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,500
but fucking airlines want to make

979
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,500
money so they make the seats so tiny

980
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,500
that you're not comfortable.

981
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,500
So you can't fall asleep on them.

982
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,500
As a kid, I could fall asleep on them a little bit

983
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,500
because I was like tiny. I was a small little kid.

984
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,500
Now, absolutely not.

985
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,500
No way in hell can I fall asleep on a plane.

986
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,500
I'll get like... I can doze off

987
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,500
for like five minutes at a time

988
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,500
maybe because I'm so sleep deprived.

989
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,500
But otherwise, I cannot sleep

990
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,500
on a plane. I need to get like first class

991
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,500
tickets where I can lay down completely

992
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,500
horizontally because

993
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,500
if I'm in that tiny stupid economy class

994
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,500
seats, I can't sleep.

995
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,500
Like, I can't do it.

996
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,500
I'm really, I'm really

997
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
passionate about hating planes.

998
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,500
Okay.

999
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,500
Um, yeah, sorry. I fell asleep on a plane

1000
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,500
one time when I was a kid while I was

1001
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,500
taking off and I woke up as it was

1002
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,500
landing. And so that means I didn't

1003
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,500
like yawn or anything or

1004
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,500
to try to fix my ears.

1005
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,500
Um, and so

1006
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,500
when I woke up, I literally couldn't even hear

1007
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,500
anything for half the day afterwards.

1008
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,500
And my ears were in so much pain

1009
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,500
and my mom was like good morning

1010
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,500
in me and I was like

1011
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,500
I can't hear anything.

1012
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,500
Like it was so, it was, everything

1013
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,500
was so um

1014
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,500
I can't think of the word

1015
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,500
like um

1016
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,500
muffled. Everything was so, so, so

1017
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,500
so muffled.

1018
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,500
Um, I hated that, I hated that

1019
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,500
and that's why I never, even if I

1020
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,500
am tired, I try to wait

1021
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,500
at least like until the plane is

1022
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,500
all the way up to even just

1023
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,500
relax. Just to relax

1024
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,500
and like

1025
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,500
sit back

1026
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,500
and like, I don't know

1027
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,500
de- de- de- de- stress a little bit

1028
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,500
but while it goes up I'm like

1029
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,500
ahhh

1030
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,500
yawning a little time.

1031
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,500
I'm freaking the fuck out because it's going

1032
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,500
too fast and it's going

1033
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,500
it's going up too fast shit like that

1034
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,500
and it's really bumpy sometimes.

1035
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,500
Um, but now when I'm older

1036
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,500
I've realized that I should have

1037
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,500
been scared when I was a kid.

1038
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,500
I should have been pissing myself and shit in

1039
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,500
myself because I could have died.

1040
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,500
I could have died.

1041
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,500
Okay.

1042
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,500
Next, next slide.

1043
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,500
Ahem.

1044
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,500
Alright.

1045
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,500
Now I'm going to disprove some lies

1046
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,500
that airlines tell you because they want to

1047
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,500
make money, right? They're not going to

1048
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,500
they're not going to tell you the truth.

1049
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,500
They're not going to tell you the truth because

1050
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,500
if they told you the truth then you wouldn't

1051
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,500
be buying airplane tickets

1052
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,500
because you don't want to die, obviously. No one wants

1053
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,500
to die. Especially not on an airplane

1054
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,500
because that's the most terrifying way

1055
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,500
to die. It's like, it's like a death roller coaster

1056
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,500
basically except like

1057
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,500
you could get flung out of your seat.

1058
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,500
Hahaha.

1059
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,500
So it's even worse than a death roller coaster

1060
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,500
because at the end you'll die

1061
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,500
but you might die in the middle too.

1062
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,500
Or at the start. It really depends

1063
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,500
what happens.

1064
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,500
Anyways.

1065
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,500
Disproving airline lies.

1066
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,500
So, here's some lies

1067
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,500
that airlines, there's something wrong with my

1068
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,500
there's something wrong with my windowcapture.

1069
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,500
I don't know.

1070
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,500
Here's some lies that airlines have told you

1071
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,500
and why they're fake.

1072
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,500
Number one.

1073
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,500
Airplanes are safer than cars.

1074
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,500
There's only

1075
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,500
one crash, one airplane crash

1076
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,500
out of bajillions of flights, right?

1077
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
So you shouldn't even worry

1078
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,500
because your chances of getting into a crash

1079
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,500
are like slim to none, right? WRONG!

1080
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,500
WRONG! WRONG!

1081
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,500
Because crashes aren't the only thing that

1082
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,500
can go wrong, okay? Crashes aren't the only thing

1083
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,500
that can go wrong.

1084
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,500
Oh, there's so little deaths.

1085
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,500
There are still deaths and there are horrific deaths.

1086
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,500
There are freak accident deaths

1087
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,500
and I'm scared of dying in a freak accident.

1088
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,500
Is that so wrong?

1089
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,500
Is that so wrong to be afraid of dying in a freak accident?

1090
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,500
I don't think so. Okay, here's the truth.

1091
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,500
I don't care about the crash stats, okay?

1092
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,500
If something goes wrong and I fall

1093
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,500
40,000 feet from the ground,

1094
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,500
I will die. All of you will die.

1095
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,500
You don't have a chance of surviving.

1096
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,500
One time, one girl fell from her airplane

1097
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,500
and she survived and she walked to the jungle

1098
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,500
for, I don't know, three weeks and she survived.

1099
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,500
I don't care! God was on her side.

1100
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,500
I don't know, Buddha was on her side.

1101
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,500
Fucking, Satan was on her side.

1102
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,500
Fucking, I don't know, whatever you believe in,

1103
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,500
they were on her side. The universe hates me.

1104
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,500
I have terrible, terrible luck with everything

1105
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,500
in my life, okay?

1106
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,500
Everything that's ever gone wrong in my life

1107
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,500
has gone wrong in my life.

1108
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,500
So,

1109
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,500
no one will be on my side

1110
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,500
if I fall 40,000 feet in the air, okay?

1111
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,500
Okay.

1112
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,500
Just boat clutch it.

1113
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,500
I don't have a boat. I don't have a bucket of water

1114
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,500
while I'm on the...

1115
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,500
I don't have a boat and I don't have

1116
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,500
a bucket of water while I'm on the airplane, okay?

1117
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,500
I'm not ready to boat clutch and I'm not ready

1118
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,500
to water clutch. I don't have a block

1119
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,500
of hay with me. I don't have a block of slime

1120
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,500
with me, okay? I'm not ready.

1121
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,500
I'll catch you. You're gonna die, too.

1122
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,500
Number two.

1123
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,500
Wait, sorry, yeah. Number two.

1124
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,500
Second line that they tell you.

1125
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,500
Airlines do a lot of maintenance on planes.

1126
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,500
You know, they run by fucking...

1127
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,500
They have all these...

1128
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,500
mechanics and all these

1129
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,500
engineers that they hired.

1130
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,500
Um, the...

1131
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,500
Stop giving me advice in chat!

1132
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,500
Mod's next person that gives me advice

1133
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,500
in chat, ban them. I'm not getting over this fear.

1134
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,500
Okay?

1135
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,500
We're not here... We're here to disprove

1136
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,500
the lies that Airlines told us, okay?

1137
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,500
We're not here to spread them.

1138
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,500
Thank you.

1139
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,500
Um, okay.

1140
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,500
You know, they tell you that they do a lot of maintenance.

1141
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,500
There's a whole checklist of things that you...

1142
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,500
that they check before even getting off...

1143
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,500
uh, getting off the ground, you know?

1144
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,500
There's always delays when you're

1145
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,500
about to take an airplane because, you know,

1146
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,500
they gotta check the plane before they

1147
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,500
get off the...

1148
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,500
the ground before they take off, you know?

1149
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,500
Sorry, not getting off.

1150
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,500
Take off.

1151
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,500
Before they take off.

1152
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,500
But the truth is,

1153
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,500
they only care about money.

1154
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,500
They only care about money. Okay?

1155
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,500
Just like any other business, they only care about money.

1156
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,500
You know who runs Airlines? Do you think

1157
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,500
an engineer runs Airlines? No, it's some

1158
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,500
random fucking billionaire. Do you think he cares

1159
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,500
about your life? No. Is he gonna cut corners

1160
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,500
where he can? Yes, absolutely

1161
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,500
he will. Okay?

1162
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,500
Um, if they're losing money,

1163
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,500
they will cheap out. They will cheap out

1164
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,500
and they will loosen the safety procedures

1165
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,500
and they will get that plane

1166
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,500
right back off the ground as soon

1167
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,500
as it touches land because that's what

1168
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,500
makes them money, okay? They will not let

1169
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,500
that plane rest because every second

1170
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,500
that a plane is on the ground, they are losing

1171
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,500
money. Okay? Okay.

1172
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,500
So, they will...

1173
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,500
loosen their safety procedures so they can get that plane back up

1174
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,500
in the air. And they will fire

1175
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,500
any whistleblowers that tries to,

1176
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,500
you know, warn them that there's something wrong,

1177
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,500
you know?

1178
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,500
Because you aren't doing enough checks on your planes.

1179
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,500
Hey guys, your safety procedures aren't good enough.

1180
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,500
They will fire those people

1181
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,500
that do that because they're, you know,

1182
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,500
they're not interested in keeping people

1183
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,500
that actually care about safety, okay?

1184
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,500
They're interested in keeping the people

1185
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,500
that will make them money, okay?

1186
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,500
Um, if you want proof,

1187
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,500
see Air Alaska Flight 261,

1188
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,500
okay? That's your proof.

1189
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,500
Um, it, literally what I'm describing

1190
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,500
is what happened. They fired the whistleblower

1191
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,500
and, um...

1192
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,500
And the plane went down

1193
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,500
because they weren't doing maintenance

1194
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,500
well enough.

1195
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,500
Ah...

1196
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,500
I have to take a breath.

1197
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,500
I do have sources.

1198
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,500
I do have sources. I can't hear what sources.

1199
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,500
Of course I can't hear what sources.

1200
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,500
Of course I can't hear what sources.

1201
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,500
You think, you think I don't do research?

1202
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,500
I do a lot of research.

1203
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,500
Okay.

1204
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,500
Next.

1205
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,500
Um...

1206
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,500
What is the next one?

1207
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,500
Should I get more water?

1208
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,500
Hold on. Let me take a break.

1209
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,500
Alright.

1210
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,500
Number three.

1211
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,500
They tell you, oh, if you follow

1212
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,500
the safety procedures during an emergency,

1213
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,500
you'll have a higher chance of living.

1214
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,500
Sure, sure, sure.

1215
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,500
If you survive the crash,

1216
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,500
if you survive the crash,

1217
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,500
and you follow the safety procedures,

1218
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,500
maybe, maybe, but it really

1219
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,500
all depends on the circumstance.

1220
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,500
It really all depends on the circumstance, okay?

1221
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,500
Because

1222
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,500
planes will burst into flames

1223
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,500
60 seconds or less

1224
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,500
or less

1225
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,500
after the crash, okay?

1226
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,500
60 seconds or less or more,

1227
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,500
it really, really depends, okay?

1228
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,500
It really, everything depends on your circumstance, okay?

1229
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,500
So, sure, you could follow every single

1230
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,500
safety procedure, but if the plane fucking bursts

1231
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,500
into flames, you know,

1232
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,500
like 30 seconds after it hits the ground,

1233
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,500
you're dead, okay? You're dead because

1234
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,500
you're on fire.

1235
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,500
Like, you're dead.

1236
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,500
You don't have a water bucket around you, okay?

1237
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,500
You're, you're burning in lava.

1238
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,500
Okay, so,

1239
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,500
um, if you do

1240
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,500
survive the crash, if you do

1241
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,500
survive the crash, on land, on land,

1242
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,500
there's different circumstances on water.

1243
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,500
Just use your shield.

1244
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,500
Shield doesn't save you from fire.

1245
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,500
The shield does not, does not

1246
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,500
solve the fire. You will burn to a crisp.

1247
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,500
If you do

1248
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,500
survive the crash, somehow,

1249
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,500
good luck trying to escape

1250
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,500
a burning plane with 100 to 400

1251
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,500
other people also trying to escape.

1252
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,500
Obviously, it depends

1253
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,500
because obviously, there could have been

1254
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,500
people that died during the crash

1255
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,500
and maybe there's less people, but at the same time,

1256
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,500
a lot of people are going to try to escape

1257
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,500
at once. Will flavor crisp?

1258
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,500
I feel like I would be like

1259
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,500
Hot Cheeto flavor.

1260
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,500
Or like, cheese flavor.

1261
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,500
I like cheese. I eat a lot of cheese.

1262
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,500
Sigh.

1263
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,500
Higher chance my ass goes from

1264
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,500
1% safe to 3% safe? Exactly.

1265
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,500
Yeah. Like, sure.

1266
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,500
I'll, I'll follow the safety procedures

1267
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,500
because I'm not an asshole. I'm not an idiot.

1268
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,500
Okay, I'll follow the safety procedures. I know

1269
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,500
every time I get on a plane, I read that

1270
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,500
fucking booklet front to back like 15

1271
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,500
times because I need to make sure that if

1272
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,500
somehow I do survive the plane crash, I know what

1273
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,500
to do to live after the plane

1274
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,500
crashes as well. Okay.

1275
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,500
Ahem.

1276
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,500
A sudden barrage of kisses. I missed you. Oh, I

1277
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,500
missed you too.

1278
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,500
Maybe the plane crashes 100 times this week.

1279
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,500
Oh.

1280
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,500
Okay, number 4, Final One.

1281
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,500
Turbulence is normal and will not make the plane fly

1282
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,500
out of the sky.

1283
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,500
I know turbulence is normal. Okay, I know.

1284
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,500
I know. It happens.

1285
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,500
It happens to every single plane, every single

1286
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,500
fucking plane I've been on, I've been

1287
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,500
bounced around like a fucking volleyball.

1288
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,500
Every single plane I've been on I've been

1289
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,500
ass fucked by my seat because

1290
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:25,500
The truth, the truth, why does turbulence make me feel like I'm falling out of the sky?

1291
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,500
I know why it makes me feel like I'm falling out of the sky, but that's why you feel like

1292
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,100
you're falling when you're in an elevator.

1293
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:35,220
You feel the change, you know, you feel the change, your body feels it because objects

1294
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:38,940
that are in motion stay in motion, whatever the fuck, I don't care, but it makes me feel

1295
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:44,540
like I'm falling out of the sky and that makes me, oops, and that makes me, my phone

1296
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:48,660
is about to die, that makes me uncomfortable, that makes me uncomfortable, I don't want

1297
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,860
to feel like I'm falling out of the sky while I'm on a plane.

1298
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:52,860
Is that bad?

1299
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:57,900
Is it so bad to not want to feel like I'm falling out of the sky while I'm on a plane?

1300
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:03,780
That's literally 40,000 feet in the air, because that makes me uncomfortable, and, and, and

1301
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:10,300
the, the, the, k tipped $5, turbulence is God's way of reminding humans they don't belong

1302
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,300
in the sky.

1303
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:18,180
It's the fucking, it's the, it's nature's way of reminding humans that you're not supposed

1304
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:21,500
to be here, and that's why it's trying to make you uncomfortable because you're not

1305
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,060
supposed to be here, you're supposed to be on land, you don't have wings, get out of

1306
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,060
the fucking sky.

1307
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:32,580
Okay, anyways, um, for what I was going to say, also, also, sometimes it might be turbulence,

1308
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:35,980
but sometimes it might be something else, sometimes something could be going wrong,

1309
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:38,940
and you know what the, the pilots are going to say, nothing, the pilots are going to say

1310
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:42,540
shit to you, you think they're going to get on the fucking radio and they're going to

1311
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:49,820
be like, alright guys, so, um, actually, uh, our left wing exploded and we are, um, struggling

1312
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:54,580
to keep the plane in the air, um, yeah, please put on your seatbelt, no, they probably won't

1313
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:58,100
say that, they probably won't say that, they'll probably put on the fucking fasten seatbelt

1314
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:01,460
sign, they'll ask the flight attendants to make sure everyone's in their seat, and then

1315
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,980
they'll figure it out from there because they don't want people freaking the fuck out,

1316
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:04,980
you know?

1317
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:08,540
They don't, they don't want people freaking the fuck out, that would feel more than turbulence,

1318
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:12,060
I know, I know, I know, I know, I would feel like more than turbulence, but I'm just saying,

1319
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:17,220
I felt really bad turbulence before, I have felt really, because I've been on really small

1320
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:22,220
planes before, and like, smaller planes, I feel like you're more affected by turbulence

1321
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:27,620
on smaller planes, so it's like, I felt myself falling out of the sky for like, multiple

1322
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:35,300
seconds on tiny, tiny planes, and like, sure, it could be that, you know, it's just turbulence,

1323
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,340
but it could also be that one of the engines just went out, you know?

1324
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:42,180
Because when an engine goes out, then it does, it does, it does lower the plane, because

1325
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:48,860
obviously the plane cannot stay up at a high altitude when there's only one engine going,

1326
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:51,860
you know?

1327
01:01:51,860 --> 01:02:00,500
Besides, isn't the autopilot flying like 85, it is, yes, yes, usually autopilot is doing

1328
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:07,780
its thing, but sometimes autopilot will force you to do its own thing because something

1329
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:08,900
went wrong.

1330
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:14,180
As I've watched the video literally today, the autopilot was not turning off, because

1331
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:18,500
there was an explosion in the plane, and it fucked with the fucking circuits, and they

1332
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:25,580
couldn't control the fucking plane, because the autopilot went off, went on, and it wouldn't

1333
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:26,740
turn off.

1334
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:30,900
You cannot, you don't, I don't trust autopilot, I don't trust autopilot, don't trust machines,

1335
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,020
don't trust machines, I don't trust humans either, because obviously there's the case

1336
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:38,580
of that one pilot being really suicidal, and literally driving the plane into the earth

1337
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,540
because he was suicidal, I don't trust either.

1338
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:47,540
I got to work with a guy who worked on Aerolasca 261, nice guy, quit that shop when a wheel

1339
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:51,540
fell off our plane mid-flight and hit a swimming pool.

1340
01:02:51,540 --> 01:03:00,540
Yeah, yeah, um, what was I saying?

1341
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:03,540
I completely forgot, thank you for the five dollars though.

1342
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:12,060
Uh-huh, I've seen autopilot fight against the pilots, it can happen, computers, computers,

1343
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:15,660
you know, break sometimes, and sometimes the computer will take over and will not let

1344
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:20,660
you control, you know?

1345
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:28,660
Um, there's been a bunch of plane crashes because pilots did stupid shit like letting

1346
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:31,940
their kids fly the plane, that's also why I don't trust humans, because I literally

1347
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:37,100
saw that story a while ago, some fucking guy was flying the plane, he was like a copilot

1348
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:42,100
or something, or like, they have like two pilots on a plane or something, I don't know.

1349
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:46,980
And so while one of the pilots left, he fucking called his kids up to the cockpit and was

1350
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:50,900
like, hey, come over here kids, let me help you fly the plane, let me show you how to

1351
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:51,900
fly the plane.

1352
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:56,900
He let his daughter go first, and of course, as a responsible child, she does not touch

1353
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:02,380
the wheel, okay, she just kind of sits there, and you know, doesn't really do much because

1354
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:06,460
you're a fucking child, like don't let your kids fly a fucking plane, but then of course

1355
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:10,860
he brings his son up, and like the stupid kid his son is, grabs the fucking wheel and

1356
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:15,780
like turns it all sorts of ways, and then they go flying out of the air, and they can't

1357
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:20,740
get control of the plane anymore, and they die, they die, because humans are stupid and

1358
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:23,540
they do stupid shit, okay?

1359
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:27,660
So I don't trust a human to run a plane, I don't trust a machine to run a plane because

1360
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:31,660
I don't trust being in a plane, because it's dangerous.

1361
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:35,740
What was I talking about?

1362
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:40,620
Yeah, I've heard the saying, oh turbulence is just like road bumps, it's basically just

1363
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:45,860
like bumps in the road, but when I'm in the road, and I'm driving, and I go over a bump,

1364
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:50,180
I don't feel like I'm falling out of the sky, okay, usually I don't even feel like

1365
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:52,940
I'm falling, because it's never a big bump like that.

1366
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:54,780
Well, what happened?

1367
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,340
Wait, oh wait, that happened?

1368
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:57,340
Yes, it did.

1369
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:02,620
Some stupid pilot let his kids fly the plane and they died.

1370
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:04,820
You're clearly not driving fast enough?

1371
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:10,540
I'm not, because I'm a safe driver, okay?

1372
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:19,260
I drive at the speed limit, or maybe a little bit over, but I'm a safe driver.

1373
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:22,820
My elbow was speeding the whole time, that's another reason I was getting nauseous, because

1374
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:29,500
he's like a really shitty driver, and he speeds all the time, and he just drives bad in general.

1375
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:39,100
Alright, there we go, that's that slide, next slide, alright.

1376
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:44,620
Everything that can go wrong will go wrong, everything that has gone wrong will go wrong

1377
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:45,620
again.

1378
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:54,140
I don't know that fucking saying anything that can happen will happen, yes, yes, any stupid

1379
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:59,580
shit that you think might happen on the plane probably has happened before, and it probably

1380
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:07,100
will happen again, and it could happen to you, it could happen to any one of us.

1381
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:10,100
Yes, Murphy's Law.

1382
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:20,100
Next, oh sorry, alright, a law can go wrong, a lot, every, obviously it's a machine, so

1383
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:24,660
any sort of mechanical thing can go wrong, but I'm going to tell you other ways it can

1384
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:25,660
go wrong too.

1385
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:33,220
Hijacking, hijacking used to be so fucking common back in like the 70s, it was crazy.

1386
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:39,420
Plays used to get hijacked all the fucking time, obviously not anymore, not as much anymore,

1387
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:46,660
but it still happens, because recently, globally there's been at least one a year, at least

1388
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:51,060
one usually, sometimes more, sometimes two or three, that's recent.

1389
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:55,860
Now you could be that one, or that two, you could be on two, you could have been on both

1390
01:06:55,860 --> 01:07:01,580
planes that got hijacked, and you know, you're at the mercy of the hijackers, they can do

1391
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:07,300
whatever the fuck they want, I saw, I was watching, can you tell I'm a big fan of the

1392
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,300
show Mayday?

1393
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:23,180
Mayday is a show about plane crashes, I literally watched a hijacking story, right, and some

1394
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:30,100
stupid dumb ass hijackers hijacked the plane, right, and they were like, take us to Australia,

1395
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:34,220
and this plane was in Africa somewhere I think, I don't remember where, the plane was over

1396
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:41,660
Africa I think, and obviously planes don't hold extra fuel really, because obviously

1397
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:46,140
like why would the airline waste money and give them extra fuel, they hold a little bit

1398
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:52,380
of extra fuel, but not a lot, not a lot, because that's you know, you don't want to waste money

1399
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:59,740
holding extra fuel, right, so the plane only had enough fuel for like two hours of a drive,

1400
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:06,060
of a flight, okay, because their destination was like two hours away, right, and the hijackers

1401
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:11,780
hijacked the plane, and they were like, drive us, drive us, fly us to Australia right now,

1402
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:16,540
or else we'll fucking kill everyone on this plane, we'll you know, we'll defuse a bomb

1403
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:22,540
on this plane and everyone's gonna die, and so the pilots literally had to fly the plane

1404
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:27,620
into the ocean, because they were forced to fly into the ocean, but they didn't have

1405
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:35,620
enough fuel to you know, get to Australia, because they didn't they didn't fuel the plane

1406
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:40,780
enough, and that's fine, I'm fine with not having that much extra fuel, but I'm scared

1407
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:44,340
of hijacking, of course I'm scared of being hijacked, are you kidding me, I literally

1408
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:50,140
watched this story, one time of this lady from the show I survived, her plane got hijacked,

1409
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:56,380
they landed the plane safely, but then they fucking, the police were trying to negotiate

1410
01:08:56,660 --> 01:09:04,620
with the hijackers, and every time the negotiations went wrong, they would literally bring a passenger

1411
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:10,340
up to the exit of the plane, and shoot the passenger in the head, and then push them

1412
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:13,700
out of the plane into a pile of other dead people that they shot in the head for the

1413
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:20,860
negotiations going wrong, like I'm afraid of hijackers, and I can't escape a hijacker

1414
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:27,020
when I'm in the air, you know, like if I'm in a bus and it gets hijacked, like I can

1415
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:31,620
still escape because I'm on the ground, you know, but if I'm in a plane, I'm in the air,

1416
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:35,700
there's no way of escaping a hijacker, I'm at their mercy, you know, I mean you're still

1417
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:39,540
at the mercy of a hijacker, like if you're on the ground, but you're less at their mercy

1418
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:42,980
because you're on the ground, and you can run away if you find a way to get out, you

1419
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:54,580
know, I forgot that your 747 could be smuggling illegal smoke nades that go off in the back

1420
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:59,740
by accident and crash the thing from smoke and flames, you're talking about like, I

1421
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:08,100
don't know what smoke nade is, I don't know what that is, cars have four doors, planes

1422
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:15,540
have one, planes don't have one door, they have more than one door, often planes have

1423
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:24,740
like, one, two, three, four, maybe like six exits, I think, nades, oh grenades, oh nades,

1424
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:39,340
oh nade, nades, I mean it is nades, nades, it's like what the fuck is a nades, how am

1425
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:44,300
I supposed to know that nades, how am I supposed to know it's pronounced nades, nades, how

1426
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:50,180
am I supposed to know that, who, who, who pronounces, like who shortens grenades to nades, who

1427
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:59,380
does that, suddenly Espanol, who shortens grenades to nades, I never heard that before,

1428
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:04,020
if they only had one door it would take three hours to get everyone off the plane, oh wait

1429
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:07,220
no they still, it still takes forever to get off a plane because they only let you out

1430
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:14,420
through the one door, the other doors are for emergencies, you know, gamers, gamers, I'm

1431
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:20,380
not a gamer, so how am I supposed to know that nades is pronounced nades, it sounds

1432
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:30,420
like aids, whatever, whatever, okay here's some technical issues that I've seen stories

1433
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:36,980
about, first one, a tiny little crack in the plane can make the whole fucking roof break

1434
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:43,620
off, see aloha airlines flight 243, they had, I don't know what was wrong exactly, they

1435
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:48,100
had small cracks in the plane and something happened, like the cabin depressurized or

1436
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:52,020
something because of that, like if there's a hole in the plane like it's bad, like people

1437
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:57,140
get sucked out, you know, because the plane is going so fast, so what ended up happening

1438
01:11:57,140 --> 01:12:02,500
was like the roof of the half of, the roof of the front half of the plane literally ripped

1439
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:09,940
off while they were in the air, right, and the plane was like hanging on by a thread,

1440
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:16,900
the front of the plane where the pilots were was like hanging off, hanging on by a thread

1441
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:24,020
because it was like, you know, it didn't have as much support anymore, right, so when it

1442
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:27,780
ripped off, like when the roof ripped off, the flight attendants were literally like

1443
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:32,220
going to people that were sitting on the plane and they were like, does anyone know how to

1444
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:37,140
fly a plane here, because they didn't know if they had pilots still or not, you know,

1445
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:43,140
didn't it kill a steward, I think it did, I think it did, mayday watch along, you want

1446
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:52,580
to watch mayday with me, usually on big planes they use the missed front and rear ones, but

1447
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:57,660
yeah, it takes a while, oh, like the exits, I've only been on planes where they used one

1448
01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:04,500
exit to get everyone off the plane afterwards, but yeah, and and like it was like they were

1449
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:11,340
racing to land this plane because it was about to break in half in the sky, you know, that's

1450
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:18,020
terrifying, and also if you do, you know, if your plane does, if the roof of your plane

1451
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:22,580
does come off, you can't breathe up there, it's too fast and there's the air pressure

1452
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:27,420
is like really, I think low, like there's not enough oxygen up there for you to breathe,

1453
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:35,700
okay, so you just die, 243 they used a metal scraper to remove sealant, this cut through

1454
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,700
the special coating that protects the metal from elements, so the metal got wet started

1455
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:43,860
to rust and gave out, mm-hmm, any tiny thing that goes wrong can cause like a huge effect

1456
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:49,380
on the plane, here, some idiot forgetting to uncover the air pressure sensors, it can

1457
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:55,220
make the like the height meter, because the air pressure sensors is how the plane senses

1458
01:13:55,220 --> 01:14:00,740
how high it is in the air, and they can it can make the the sensors not work anymore,

1459
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:04,660
and so the pilots don't know how high they are in the air, and I saw a story about that,

1460
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:13,580
I don't remember which flight it was, I got I couldn't I couldn't look for it, but some

1461
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:18,260
maintenance asshole put some tin foil or something on the air pressure sensors and forgot to

1462
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:25,740
take it off, and so as they were taking off the computers on the plane were like, oh you're

1463
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:30,820
too high in the sky, I think that was it, you're too high in the sky, right, so the

1464
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:39,780
pilots of course trusting the computer on the plane started to descend, and so then the

1465
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:44,380
other sensor went off, and it was like, oh you're too low in the sky, and then both sensors

1466
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:47,740
were going off, like both alarms were going off saying you're both too high in the sky

1467
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:51,060
and too low in the sky, and they didn't know what to do, because what are you supposed to do,

1468
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:54,820
and they don't know how high they are in the sky, because they can't see anything, you

1469
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:58,220
can't really you can't actually see anything when you're that high in the sky, you know,

1470
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:03,140
and so they kept going down and down and down until they eventually just crashed into the

1471
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:06,860
ocean, and I'll talk about ocean crashes because those are really scary, can't they see how

1472
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:12,420
high they are, no they couldn't, because they were above the ocean, and I think it was like,

1473
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:15,460
if it's nighttime you can't see anything, you really can't see anything, especially when

1474
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:19,780
you're above the ocean, the ocean is like pitch black at night, like you really can't see

1475
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:24,340
anything when you're in the ocean at night, like if you're in the middle of the ocean, if you're

1476
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:28,900
near civilization, I'm sure you could see lights, but they were in the middle of the ocean, you

1477
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:36,500
can't see anything, alright, and that's how they crash into the water. Next, if the inside of,

1478
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:45,180
I wrote plain wrong, I wrote, I have a lot of typos in this, just jumping in to say I

1479
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:48,100
completely agree with this, I have a fear of flying in planes as well, it is completely

1480
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:53,780
rational, thank you, it is rational, it is rational, if the inside of the plane isn't

1481
01:15:53,780 --> 01:16:00,260
pressurized correctly, you brain, why are you acting so gay, something original tip $20,

1482
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:05,540
don't forget about all the times that one plane just smashed into another one because one of

1483
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:12,700
the pilots fucked up, you can die even if your pilot didn't do anything wrong, I know that one,

1484
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:17,180
I know that one, yeah, one plane just crashed, and there were two really big planes and they

1485
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:21,380
just crashed into each other, I don't remember exactly what the story was, I have to, I have

1486
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:27,180
to think of, I have to watch the video again, but yeah, it was, it was something like that,

1487
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:38,700
like two planes like crashed into each other, like in the sky, I think a plane crashed in

1488
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:42,580
Brazil last week and everyone died, that's what I'm saying, plane crashes are so deadly,

1489
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:49,780
so deadly, like if something goes wrong, like you're a dead man, at that point,

1490
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:52,740
I'm gonna go get more water and then I'll continue, hold on.

1491
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:38,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1492
01:17:38,700 --> 01:18:08,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

yeah

1530
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:54,700
why is it why is it black on screen

1531
01:24:54,700 --> 01:25:14,700
I have a green screen somewhere do I have a green screen I do have a green screen there we go okay there we go sorry about sorry about that I don't know I have a green screen there was a green screen on the capture um reminds me of driving

1532
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:24,700
yeah

1533
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:36,700
you don't notice this happening until it's too late spirit spirit has cheap seats and then make their money back nickel and diming every extra yeah yeah yeah

1534
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:52,700
okay finally finally you will die if it crash lands you will die and you may think to yourself but I'm in my seat with my seat belt in and you know

1535
01:25:52,700 --> 01:26:07,700
okay what's the 40k meme I don't understand I don't understand what that means what is 40k I'm talking about 40,000 feet in the air I people keep saying 40k I don't know what that means I'm out of the loop here warhammer 40k what is the meme though what is the

1536
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:25,700
what is the meme what like what is this some sort of meme I don't understand what is that it's a gamer meme they're just being artistic I can tell I can tell Chad is always a little artistic

1537
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:52,700
table top board board game people just get excited when you say the number okay okay seat belts are almost like a placebo or for turbulence if the plane goes down you'll die yes yes the seat belts are there to fucking keep your body from like being identified

1538
01:26:52,700 --> 01:27:02,700
they're there to keep your body from being identifiable okay because if you're in the bathroom I have that as the last point if you're in the bathroom or something while it's happening or if you're running around up and down the plane while

1539
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:13,700
it's happening your body's gonna get destroyed you know you're gonna you're gonna crumple up in little pieces and then they're not gonna find your body right or there's another theory I don't know if it's true I don't know if I

1540
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:24,700
really believe it but you know how they tell you oh if the plane is going down put your put the top of your head against the the front of your seat you know and cover your head yes you should cover your head if the plane is going

1541
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:35,700
down because if stuff is flying around which it will it will fly around if the plane goes down and it hits your head you know that's very bad and you could die from that but the thing of like putting

1542
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:44,700
your head like the top of your head on the front of the seat I've heard that they want you to like do that because when

1543
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:55,700
the plane finally hits the ground the seats are all gonna you know be pushed back like the the the back of the seats are all gonna be pushed back right at once and they want you to do that so you break your neck

1544
01:27:55,700 --> 01:28:03,700
and don't sue them they want you to do that so you die and then you can't sue them for the plane crash

1545
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:17,700
mm-hmm mic drop yep I've heard of that because um the flight attendants take a different like the flight attendants have different

1546
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:26,700
positions for emergencies like why would you put your the top of your head you know why would you stick the top of your head

1547
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:32,700
in front like against the front of your of the seat in front of you I mean against the back of the seat in front of you like why would you do that

1548
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:44,700
you're just asking for your neck to break when we hit the ground you know like they're asking for your neck to break you're asking for your neck to break

1549
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:55,700
just put your table up like I'll talk about it here putting your table up doesn't do anything putting your table up is so that your table like doesn't hit you you know

1550
01:28:55,700 --> 01:29:07,700
um alright so once again 40,000 feet in the air obviously it could be 30,000 something I don't think they go higher than 40,000 or maybe they go 50,000 I don't know they go high up

1551
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:13,700
and the reason they do that I don't think they go 50,000 I don't know but the reason they go so high up in the air because that's really fucking high up in there that's higher than the clouds

1552
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:26,700
okay the reason they go that higher high up in the air is because the air is thinner up there so they're able to go faster with less gas and so they do that to save on gas

1553
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:34,700
yeah so you know they get you that high up in the air or you're absolutely gonna die if something goes wrong and you crash just to save some fucking money

1554
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:47,700
and I know it's like oh but you get to your destination faster I don't care I don't care I don't care if I get to my destination faster I want to be closer to the ground so I live okay okay

1555
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:54,700
what about airplane mode on my phone that's faking gay that doesn't do anything

1556
01:29:55,700 --> 01:30:02,700
airplane mode doesn't do shit airplane mode is so that your phone provider doesn't charge you for being in a different country

1557
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:09,700
at least yeah right your your cell phone providers like charge you for entering a different country and getting texts in different countries

1558
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:13,700
there you go that's what you can use airplane mode for

1559
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:20,700
anyways yeah normalize airplanes being lower down in the air I don't care if it takes longer for me to get to my destination

1560
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:25,700
I don't want to be so fucking high that I can see space okay I don't want to be that high in the air

1561
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:33,700
that's scary okay anyways so yeah that's why they go so high in the air to save on gas maybe to go faster I don't care I don't care

1562
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:40,700
I don't want to I don't even want to go that fucking fast why are we going so fucking fast in the air it's like 3,000 kilometers per hour or something I don't know

1563
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:45,700
why are we going so fucking fast slow down okay like whatever

1564
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:51,700
so landing in the ocean right let's say you land in the ocean you might think oh but we're in the ocean so like

1565
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:57,700
you know we're not going to hit a bunch of stuff on the way down you know because if you land on on the on the ground

1566
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:02,180
you're going to hit trees you're going to hit because obviously you're crash landing right in the situation we crash landing

1567
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:09,220
you're not you're not at uh you're not at a landing strip right you're going to hit trees you're going to help you're going to hit houses

1568
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:13,700
you're going to hit cars or maybe you're going to hit like a field if you're fucking lucky a flat field

1569
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:21,220
but probably not um or um so instead of that you might think oh maybe landing in the ocean is better

1570
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:25,860
because you won't be hitting all this stuff on the way down and so your plane isn't gonna fall apart

1571
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:29,220
while you're like hitting or mountains even you can even hit mountains when you're on the on the

1572
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:34,660
way down right if you're landing in the ocean it's just as bad or i guess even more dangerous than

1573
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:40,100
on the ground is what i wrote here because a lot of airplanes have their engines um right underneath

1574
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:43,860
the wings right those are where the engines are they're attached to the bottom of the wings

1575
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:51,700
so what happens is as the plane is falling into the water the engine the water will like the

1576
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:55,780
engine one will hit the water first like the engines are one of the first things that hit the

1577
01:31:55,780 --> 01:32:01,300
water right the bottom of the plane or or the engine and all the water is going to go rushing

1578
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:06,180
into the engine of the plane and it's just going to rip the engine like it's going to rip the plane

1579
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:12,340
apart you know because it's like stopping the plane and planes go really really fucking fast

1580
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:17,620
and so obviously the plane is not going to be able to withstand all of that um

1581
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:25,140
all of that like force and it's going to rip and rip in pieces go lower and spend

1582
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:31,060
way more time in the plane no thank you if i feel safer i'd rather spend more time

1583
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:36,660
and also make the seats bigger but it doesn't matter because they're never gonna do that

1584
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:38,340
they're never gonna do either of those things

1585
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:52,820
oh this thing right it's gonna tear the plane apart and you're gonna end up

1586
01:32:52,820 --> 01:33:00,420
fucking jostled around in a torn apart plane and let's say you got really unlucky and you

1587
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:04,260
landed in the middle of the fucking ocean the middle of but fuck nowhere in the ocean okay

1588
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:11,860
you got really unlucky nowhere near any sort of island nowhere near any sort of like coastline

1589
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:16,820
you're just in the middle of the but fuck ocean right you better hope you're on some sort of boat

1590
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:21,380
you better hope you're on some sort of safety raft obviously there's safety rafts in in um

1591
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:27,140
in planes if they do land on the water sure there's safety rafts but the chance of the

1592
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:32,980
plane landing safely on the water so that the safety rafts can deploy are probably minimal okay

1593
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:37,220
they're probably minimal if you have to crash land into the freaking water the plane is destroyed

1594
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:42,900
it in pieces right okay so you better hope that you're you have some sort of thing to hang on to

1595
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:48,980
that's floating because it'll take multiple hours to even days for a rescue to come and

1596
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:54,420
save you guys and if you're in cold water then you're just dead okay just you know like

1597
01:33:55,380 --> 01:34:01,140
there is no there is no jack what's it called jack and rose no titanic that's not happening

1598
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:09,140
okay rose is dying okay both of you are dying um because you'll die in like 45 minutes in cold

1599
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:16,980
water right we need a sad violin trains cars planes i i'm okay with trains trains are okay

1600
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:25,460
uh trains are okay i don't mind trains but yeah you'll die in like 45 minutes in cold water basically

1601
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:33,780
and if you are a dumbass if you were a dumbass and i am a dumbass and lots of people are dumbasses

1602
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:38,580
in this world if you were a dumbass and you didn't read the safety instructions and you inflated your

1603
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:44,740
life jacket before exiting the plane okay and you're crash landing into the ocean you're also dead

1604
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:49,620
because dead you're also dead because water is going to come rushing into the plane

1605
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:54,180
and you're going to be forced to the top you're going to be forced to the top and sure the plane

1606
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:58,580
is in pieces but the part of the plane you're in might not be in pieces okay the part of the plane

1607
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:03,620
you're in might still be pretty you know put together you might not have fallen out of the plane

1608
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:08,420
and you're you have your life raft i mean your life jacket already inflated you're going to just

1609
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:12,180
get pushed all the way to the ceiling and you're not going to be able to escape you're not going

1610
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:17,780
to be able to escape because you can't fight the life jacket to swim so you're basically just drowning

1611
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:25,140
you're forced to sit there and drown okay okay that's natural selection i'm a dumb bitch okay i

1612
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:28,660
when you're when you're freaking out when you're panicking your you do stupid shit when you're

1613
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:34,660
panicking okay you do stupid shit and and that's understandable and i i feel bad for anyone that's

1614
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:39,140
been on a plane and crash landed into the ocean and inflated their life jacket before falling

1615
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:42,980
into the ocean because i would probably do the same because i'm freaking the fuck out and i don't

1616
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:47,940
want to die and the life jacket has the word life in it and i want i don't i any i want to keep my

1617
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:56,180
life okay okay crash landing in on random land you better hope you have multiple kilometers

1618
01:35:56,180 --> 01:36:01,220
multiple okay i'm going to use my little i'm going to use my little my little hat to point

1619
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:06,820
multiple kilometers of flat space to land on otherwise you're just going to crash into everything

1620
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:12,100
and also tear the plane apart planes cannot land on the ground really they need a landing

1621
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:17,780
strip they need they need an airport to land at if something goes wrong they can't just be like okay

1622
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:22,180
emergency landing on the ground no if something goes wrong wrong they have to go to the nearest

1623
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:26,260
airport there's no emergency landing on the ground there's emergency landing at the nearest airport

1624
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:33,300
you know if they can control the plane obviously if they can control the plane they go to the closest

1625
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:37,460
airport that they can okay but if they can't control the plane then they have to just fucking

1626
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:41,060
crash into the ground of course and you're not going to live because the plane will tear apart

1627
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:45,140
while you're crashing into the ground because the chances of having you know multiple kilometers of

1628
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:50,180
flat space for land on a highway you're crashing into all the fucking cars in the highway like

1629
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:58,180
there's gonna be explosions there's gonna be the plane breaking apart okay even yeah even on a landing

1630
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:03,700
strip if the gear messes up you can it can still be catastrophic there was one case of uh there was

1631
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:09,060
one Mayday episode I saw where they they still had a landing strip but because I think the problem

1632
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:16,740
was that because it was so dark um they landed on the landing strip too late right and it was like

1633
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:23,380
raining or something or like frozen like cold rain so it was getting frozen on the landing strip

1634
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:29,300
and so they were like gliding on the landing strip and they couldn't stop in time and they like

1635
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:34,340
they kept they kept the plane kept you know going on the ground after the strip ended and they

1636
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:42,100
crashed into some trees or something and like people died like like like emergency landings

1637
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:48,740
or just regular landings can go wrong horrifically wrong you know all right here it is the human

1638
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:54,260
body can only survive an acceleration of around four to nine G's oh but my uncle survived an

1639
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:59,060
acceleration of 12 G's I don't care I'm not your fucking uncle okay I'm a fragile fragile piece of

1640
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:04,260
human meat he said 25 dollars listening to a cute and nerdy girl you have about white airplanes

1641
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:16,100
our bad has made my absolute say Tism Tism Tism thank you for the 25 dollars Tism I'm a fragile

1642
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:22,180
piece of human meat okay I will rip apart at the smallest tiniest paper cut I got a cardboard

1643
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:27,620
cut before cardboard has cut me okay do you know how hard it is to get cut by a piece of cardboard

1644
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:37,940
it's really fucking hard so I will not I probably won't even survive four G's okay

1645
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:44,900
plane crashes can go up to like 200 G's like I'm not you're not surviving that crash you know

1646
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:50,020
some people have but you're not one of them and I'm not one of them we're not lucky like that

1647
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:53,700
or maybe you are lucky like that I don't know you but I'm not lucky like that I've never been

1648
01:38:53,700 --> 01:39:02,020
looking my entire life so yeah um the acceleration will just kill you yeah and finally what what is

1649
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:11,860
the last one there it is if you're not sitting in your seat and you're gonna die like imagine being

1650
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:16,580
in the bathroom shitting and pooping your pants and it flies everywhere and you die that's embarrassing

1651
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:21,220
okay what I'm trying to say here listen I wrote this like two seconds before stream what I'm trying

1652
01:39:21,220 --> 01:39:25,140
to say here is imagine you're in the bathroom right you're not in your seat you're in the bathroom

1653
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:29,860
and you're shitting and then suddenly the plane starts going down and you have no control over

1654
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:34,020
like where you're going because you're like you you hit the ceiling because you're not strapped to

1655
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:38,900
your you know chair you hit the ceiling your shit hits the ceiling with you your piss hits the

1656
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:44,180
ceiling with you and then finally you know the plane crashes and you die in your you die surrounded

1657
01:39:44,180 --> 01:39:48,100
by your own piss and shit with your pants down that's embarrassing that's embarrassing that's how

1658
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:55,220
Elvis died that's embarrassing you know I don't I want to if I do crash I want to look cute I want

1659
01:39:55,220 --> 01:40:01,460
my body to look cute I don't want to die in an embarrassing way because like I'm I'm honestly

1660
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:07,620
already shy I haven't died yet but I'm shy of the fucking coroner seeing my dead naked body

1661
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:13,700
you know like imagine dying in that way that's so embarrassing

1662
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:25,380
oh there you go and that's that's my um presentation thank you for listening um

1663
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:35,620
any questions any concerns that I can address you know please ask them now I will answer them to

1664
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:41,940
the best of my ability yeah gotta look your best I just want to look cute you know it's embarrassing

1665
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:46,580
it's kind of embarrassing to die because you know you shit yourself after you die and you piss yourself

1666
01:40:46,580 --> 01:40:49,460
after you die like that's embarrassing I want to at least look pretty when I do it you know

1667
01:40:51,380 --> 01:40:59,620
question I love you Imi I love you too um that's on a hot air balloon I never been on a hot air

1668
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:04,420
balloon and I never really want to I don't really trust a hot air balloon either

1669
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:13,620
well you hold my hand while we fly I will be I will be clutching that hand and squeezing

1670
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:18,580
so hard I will be squeezing the shit out of your hand like you're gonna be in pain

1671
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:23,460
thanks for educating me I've always been more scared of boats but now I'm scared of planes as

1672
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:29,460
well good you should be scared of both I'm scared of boats too um I'm scared of boats too yeah

1673
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:35,540
yeah every time I'm on a boat I'm thinking like fuck would I be able to swim out of here

1674
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:41,060
and the answer is usually no because water is actually a lot more dangerous than you think

1675
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:47,140
like water can be really really aggressive and strong and even even some olympics olympic

1676
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:52,180
swimmers will not be able to fight those kind of currents you know can we survive if we jump

1677
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:57,220
right before the plane is the ground no you can't use elevator logic in a plane no

1678
01:41:57,780 --> 01:42:02,660
no I never had the need to go on a plane but now I'll make certain the need never arises good

1679
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:10,260
stay safe don't believe the airlines don't believe the government okay they want your money and they

1680
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:15,140
just want to make sure you don't sue them I'm scared of fights but I love traveling so yeah

1681
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:24,260
I have no choice take a boat I'm less scared of a boat than I am of a plane I I don't know why

1682
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:30,580
but I I mean it makes sense like you're not going to crash into a million pieces if something

1683
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:37,300
goes wrong on a boat you know thank you for becoming a member jokes on you I'm not disillusioned

1684
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:42,260
with the idea that life is worth living booking a flight right now if you if you're if you want to die

1685
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:51,060
go ahead I won't stop you be a sheeple be a sheeple and follow everyone else

1686
01:42:51,300 --> 01:43:02,980
but us alphas okay us us lone wolves will be living surviving thriving not on a plane

1687
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:09,780
what would it take for you to skydive fucking I have cancer and I'm dying tomorrow that would

1688
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:14,420
that's what it would take for me to skydive okay that's what it would take for me to skydive

1689
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:21,140
otherwise I'm not doing it I get very seasick easily though planes are better

1690
01:43:21,140 --> 01:43:28,420
all take a gravel I'm no puke deal with it that's what I would do at least

usually she doesn't like being touched but she's been extra um

1758
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:40,900
she's been extra cuddly which worries me

1759
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:52,580
because that's completely out of character for her so yeah um are you afraid of boats on the ocean

1760

I am but not as afraid of boats as I am of airplanes I'm more afraid of planes for sure

1761
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:09,220
yeah when non cuddly animals get extra cuddly it's scary it is scary like she's not acting like
