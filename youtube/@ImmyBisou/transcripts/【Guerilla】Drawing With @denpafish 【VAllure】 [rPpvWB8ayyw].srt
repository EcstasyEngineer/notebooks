Whee!

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:56,140
Wheeinno!

6
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,140
Wait, no.

7
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,140
What?

8
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,140
Hello?

9
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,140
Hello?

10
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,140
Hello?

11
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,140
Hello?

12
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,140
We're live.

13
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,140
We're drawing.

14
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,140
We're live.

15
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,140
Hello, everyone.

16
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,140
Oh.

17
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,140
Dampo, would you like to introduce yourself?

18
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,140
Hello.

19
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,140
I'm Dampo Fish.

20
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,140
I'm a friendly alien.

21
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,140
You might know me as the...

22
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,140
No, you don't.

23
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,140
Hello.

24
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,140
It is me.

25
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,140
I'm Dampo Fish.

26
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,140
I'm a friendly alien.

27
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,140
You might know me as the...

28
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,140
No, you don't.

29
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,140
Hello.

30
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,140
It is me.

31
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,140
Hello.

32
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,140
It is me.

33
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,140
Okay.

34
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,140
Good introduction.

35
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,140
Good introduction.

36
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,140
Thank you for joining me today.

37
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,140
So...

38
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,140
Thank you.

39
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,140
Yeah, you're the original Childo Maker.

40
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,140
No, that's not me.

41
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,140
You, you, you, you, you did it.

42
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,140
You did it.

43
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,140
No, I haven't...

44
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,140
It came to you.

45
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,140
What?

46
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,140
It came to you.

47
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,140
You invented it.

48
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,140
I didn't invent the Childo you did.

49
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,140
No, I didn't...

50
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,140
Do you not want to take credit for it?

51
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,140
Why would...

52
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,140
I don't want to...

53
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,140
They're calling me the Childo Legend Ice Lady.

54
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,140
Yeah.

55
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,140
Are you not?

56
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,140
I'm the Dampo Fish, the Lady of Ice.

57
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,140
Yeah, are you not?

58
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,140
Lady of Ice.

59
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,140
I don't like the cold weather.

60
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,140
I hate it.

61
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,140
Well then, why did you make a Childo?

62
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,140
Because it was fun.

63
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,140
I mean, yeah, it is fun.

64
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,140
It is fun.

65
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,140
It is.

66
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,140
Oh.

67
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,140
Shit.

68
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,140
Okay.

69
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,140
Oh, right.

70
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,140
We should explain what we're drawing.

71
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,140
So this is our little reference for our thumbnail.

72
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,140
Excuse me.

73
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:42,140
This is our reference for our thumbnail for the ASMR video we're going to make together.

74
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,140
And I'm drawing Dampo and she's drawing me.

75
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,140
Yup.

76
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,140
It already started.

77
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,140
Yup.

78
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,140
And I find it really hard.

79
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,140
I was saying to Amy before, but I find it really hard to draw a character for the first

80
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,140
time.

81
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,140
I feel like it always looks weird the first time you draw someone because you're so focused

82
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,140
on the design.

83
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,140
You're so focused on the design.

84
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,140
And the features.

85
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,140
Getting the features right.

86
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,140
Uh-huh.

87
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,140
I understand.

88
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,140
Oh.

89
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,140
Oh.

90
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,140
Fuck.

91
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,140
Oh.

92
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,140
Fuck.

93
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,140
Oh.

94
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,140
Fuck.

95
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,140
Oh.

96
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,140
Fuck.

97
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,140
What do you just do?

98
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,140
I'm fucking on my drawing like really badly right now.

99
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,140
Hold on.

100
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,140
I'm fucking up the layers.

101
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,140
Oh, shit.

102
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,140
Oh.

103
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,140
Everything is on one layer.

104
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,140
Do you normally draw with a lot of layers over there?

105
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,140
Yeah, I do.

106
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,140
But I think I fucked it up an accidentally.

107
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,140
Uh.

108
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,140
Merged them?

109
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,140
Yeah.

110
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,140
I think it looks like it's on one layer.

111
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,140
I merged my layers by accident.

112
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,140
Are you shitting me?

113
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,140
Can't go back?

114
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,140
Oh, no.

115
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:57,140
It's so over.

116
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,140
God damn it.

117
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,140
Okay.

118
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,140
Man, it was going so well too.

119
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,140
This drawing program is a little...

120
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,140
No, it looks so good.

121
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,140
Yeah.

122
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,140
It's a bit weird.

123
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,140
It's a little laggy.

124
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,140
Yeah.

125
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,140
So I'm struggling a little bit on how to use it.

126
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,140
God damn it.

127
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,140
Damn it.

128
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,140
That's so frustrating.

129
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,140
I hate when that happens.

130
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,140
I have to redraw over it.

131
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,140
No.

132
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,140
Isn't there an undo button?

133
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,140
I can't undo any more than it currently is undone.

134
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,140
Yeah.

135
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,140
I limits the undoes.

136
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,140
I wonder if it's because it's like browser based.

137
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,140
Maybe you can't handle like infinite with so many people, but I don't know.

138
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,140
It probably just can't handle that many undoes.

139
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,140
Yeah.

140
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,140
It's too much.

141
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,140
They can't program it in.

142
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,140
Yeah.

143
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,140
Bitches.

144
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,140
Witches.

145
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,140
Denpa's Amy is looking cute.

146
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,140
It is.

147
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,140
You drew me so cute.

148
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,140
Thank you.

149
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,140
I feel like I want to like...

150
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,140
This is like my first go.

151
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,140
And as I was saying, I feel like it's kind of awkward because I'm...

152
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,140
I haven't drawn you before.

153
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,140
I wanted to draw you yesterday.

154
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,140
And I started like drawing strong.

155
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,140
And I was like, let me draw all the cute girls.

156
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,140
But it was so fucking hot since we...

157
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,140
I couldn't do it.

158
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,140
I was like lining her.

159
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,140
And I was like, I can't.

160
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,140
I can't.

161
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,140
I can't anymore.

162
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,140
It's okay.

163
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,140
You can always redraw.

164
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,140
Don't worry.

165
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,140
True.

166
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,140
True.

167
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,140
And nothing is permanent.

168
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,140
It's as part of what makes art so cool.

169
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,140
You fuck up.

170
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,140
You can just try again.

171
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,140
Yeah.

172
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,140
Nothing's permanent.

173
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,140
Yeah.

174
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,140
Nothing is permanent.

175
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,140
Let's fucking go.

176
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,140
I do really like your poofy hair.

177
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,140
And that's pretty fun to draw.

178
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,140
I really like the...

179
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,140
The balls.

180
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,140
There's so many balls in your hair.

181
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,140
There is.

182
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,140
I got lots of balls.

183
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,140
Yeah.

184
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,140
It's very...

185
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,140
It's very fun.

186
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,140
I love to draw big poofy hair.

187
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,140
So like the...

188
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,140
The poofy pigtails and the poofy balls are really fun.

189
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,140
I'm glad you like them.

190
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,140
I'm glad you like them.

191
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,140
No.

192
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,140
I got huge balls.

193
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,140
Is that right?

194
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,140
Cat or something?

195
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,140
I would like to play with your hairballs.

196
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,140
Like bat them around.

197
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,140
That's cute.

198
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,140
Denpa's a balltuber?

199
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,140
I do like a lot of games with balls.

200
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,140
It's so bad.

201
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:43,140
I was trying to mention to you that I really like your pinpals.

202
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,140
Autocracked pinpals to pinballs.

203
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,140
Pinballs?

204
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,140
Five different times.

205
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,140
Five different times.

206
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,140
So I kind of like your pinpals.

207
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,140
I like your pinballs.

208
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,140
Yeah.

209
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,140
I couldn't stop calling them pinballs.

210
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,140
When are you restarting your...

211
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,140
Your donut gun?

212
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,140
I just...

213
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,140
It's mostly on Twitch, right?

214
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

215
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,140
I'm doing it on YouTube too.

216
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,140
I've been multi-streaming it.

217
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,140
But I don't really use YouTube that much.

218
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,140
Okay.

219
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,140
I was thinking about streaming this one just on YouTube.

220
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,140
But it was like...

221
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,140
I don't know how to use YouTube.

222
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,140
I don't know how to use YouTube.

223
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,140
No, it's fair.

224
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,140
I don't fucking know how to use YouTube either.

225
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,140
I just wanted to link your...

226
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,140
I just wanted to link your stream so that people can...

227
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,140
Go check out...

228
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,140
Ah, gross, my voice.

229
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,140
Go check out...

230
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,140
Yeah, let me sit and chat.

231
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,140
Ah, fuck.

232
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,140
I don't have a waiting room setup for it or anything.

233
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,140
It's okay.

234
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,140
I'll link your Twitch.

235
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,140
Hold on.

236
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,140
And then...

237
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,140
How do I pinmessage?

238
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,140
Okay, there we go.

239
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,140
Go support Dinta.

240
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,140
Oh, you did the same thing as me.

241
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,140
I thought I made a new...

242
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,140
I literally thought I made a new one.

243
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,140
I literally thought I made a new one.

244
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,140
Fuck this drawing program.

245
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,140
I'm going to sue them.

246
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,140
I swear I did.

247
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,140
Maybe, like, I clicked it and then didn't register.

248
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,140
And thinking that might be what it was.

249
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,140
I'm going to sue them for emotional damages.

250
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,140
Hmm.

251
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,140
That's not even a thing of, like, naming our layers.

252
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,140
It's really, like, I thought I made a new layer and I didn't.

253
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,140
I think it was the same thing.

254
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,140
No, I accidentally merged my layers somehow.

255
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,140
I don't know how though.

256
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,140
It merged.

257
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,140
Yeah, I swear I made a new layer.

258
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,140
I swear I clicked on the new layer button and then just didn't make it.

259
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,140
Just didn't create it.

260
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,140
Oh, how rude.

261
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,140
Okay, you have, like, you got ears.

262
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,140
Wait, where the fuck?

263
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,140
Oh, no, wait.

264
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,140
I remember I had to delete the ears and then run.

265
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,140
I was about to freak out because I lost your ears for a second.

266
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,140
No!

267
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,140
Yeah, I don't have human ears.

268
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,140
I only have...

269
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,140
These are my ears only.

270
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,140
Okay.

271
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,140
They're like my antennas.

272
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,140
Intenas?

273
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,140
Intenas.

274
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,140
Intenas.

275
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,140
Intenas.

276
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,140
I didn't realize you didn't have human ears.

277
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,140
I'll delete the human ears.

278
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,140
There.

279
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,140
It's a secret.

280
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,140
It's a little known fact.

281
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,140
I don't have ears.

282
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,140
I don't like to hear anything.

283
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,140
I use...

284
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:50,140
I only communicate by receiving...

285
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,140
radio waves into my brain.

286
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,140
It goes directly into my brain.

287
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:58,140
Oh, do you communicate with other aliens like that?

288
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,140
Yeah.

289
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,140
Telepathically.

290
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,140
Here, I can send you messages telepathically right now.

291
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,140
Figure brain.

292
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
Are you ready?

293
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,140
I'm ready.

294
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,140
Are you receiving now?

295
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,140
I don't know.

296
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,140
What are you saying?

297
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,140
I don't know.

298
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,140
You told me.

299
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,140
I don't know.

300
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,140
I don't know what you're saying.

301
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,140
I think I don't really have Intenas to receive your messages.

302
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,140
Oh, no.

303
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,140
Still, the communication's yet again.

304
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,140
I'm sorry.

305
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,140
Oh, God.

306
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,140
My drawing looks...

307
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,140
I flipped it and it looks so fucked up.

308
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,140
I flipped it.

309
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,140
Oh, it looks so disgusting when I flip it.

310
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,140
Well, that's why you have to flip it often.

311
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,140
I always forget that I need to flip.

312
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,140
And then I flip it and constantly flip.

313
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,140
I go through phases with drawing where I flip the canvas too much.

314
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,140
And then I need to stop flipping it too much.

315
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,140
And then I just stop flipping it completely.

316
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,140
And then it cycles back.

317
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,140
And then I'm back to flipping constantly.

318
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,140
And then back to never flipping.

319
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,140
Just flip it constantly.

320
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,140
That's what I do.

321
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,140
True.

322
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,140
It's okay.

323
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,140
You don't have to be self-conscious about how much you flip a canvas.

324
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,140
No one's...

325
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,140
No one's worried about how often you flip a canvas.

326
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,140
You're safe.

327
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,140
You're safe here.

328
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,140
We don't judge you.

329
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,140
It's always the head, huh?

330
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,140
It's always the fucking head.

331
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,140
It's like you flip the head and it's like...

332
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,140
It doesn't even look like it's the same species anymore.

333
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,140
True.

334
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,140
That's why I just constantly flip it

335
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,140
so that way I can constantly fix the mistakes

336
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,140
that are forming as I'm drawing.

337
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,140
I'm trying to use your model as a reference.

338
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,140
I keep looking that over to you.

339
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,140
To your cute little face.

340
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,140
I've been looking at you too.

341
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,140
You have like big bangs.

342
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,140
So I was trying to think...

343
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,140
I wasn't sure how to draw your hair.

344
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,140
Because you're so like...

345
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,140
There's so much in your bangs.

346
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,140
It's like...

347
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,140
I'm not sure.

348
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,140
I'm trying to like work it out.

349
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,140
I'm doing my best.

350
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,140
Everyone in viewer has like humongous bangs.

351
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,140
I don't know if you've noticed.

352
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,140
We all have huge bangs.

353
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,140
Because I'm trying to figure out like...

354
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,140
Where do I begin?

355
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,140
There's so much of it.

356
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,140
You just...

357
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,140
So much of it.

358
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,140
But it's true.

359
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,140
Just try Strani too.

360
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,140
Yeah.

361
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,140
Strani's got huge bangs.

362
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,140
She's got a five head.

363
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,140
Yeah.

364
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,140
I was drawing Strani.

365
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,140
I'm like, oh my god.

366
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,140
It's kind of good her hair.

367
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,140
And there's so much bang.

368
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,140
There's so much on her head.

369
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,140
I'm having the same thing with you now.

370
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,140
You have like five different bangs.

371
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,140
You have like so many different clumps of bangs.

372
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,140
I don't know where to begin.

373
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,140
I know.

374
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,140
It's okay.

375
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,140
Don't worry about it.

376
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,140
The bangs...

377
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,140
What if the bangs are the friends we made along the way?

378
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,140
I must have a lot of friends though.

379
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,140
So many.

380
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,140
It's more of a helmet.

381
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,140
Do not think about what the skull looks like underneath.

382
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,140
I've seen what the skull looks like underneath.

383
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,140
And it's fucked.

384
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,140
No.

385
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,140
Don't see that about your skull.

386
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,140
Can you show me?

387
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,140
Maybe I can.

388
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,140
Let me see.

389
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,140
Maybe I can.

390
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,140
I gotta...

391
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,140
I won't judge you for saying it's huge.

392
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,140
Because maybe I'll agree once I see it.

393
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,140
But for now I'm judging you.

394
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,140
Okay, okay, okay.

395
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,140
Hold on.

396
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,140
Let me remove my bangs then.

397
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,140
One second.

398
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:08,140
I gotta bring my face up close a little bit so I can see what I'm doing.

399
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,140
My...

400
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,140
It's rough.

401
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,140
I'm just gonna say it's rough, okay?

402
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,140
Prepare yourself.

403
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,140
Okay.

404
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,140
Wait, is it like dented?

405
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,140
Because of the rigging?

406
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,140
Because I know sometimes I have to do that where like...

407
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,140
I had to end up dented them so that you don't have like a bald preview.

408
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,140
It's not dented.

409
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,140
It's just a rough shape.

410
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,140
It's a really rough shape.

411
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,140
Yeah.

412
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,140
Bring it.

413
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,140
It's like really...

414
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,140
It's quite small.

415
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,140
My head is...

416
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,140
Oh, fuck, wrong button.

417
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,140
My head is quite small.

418
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,140
Are you seeing it form?

419
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,140
Wait, I'm not seeing it form.

420
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,140
I'm not seeing your head.

421
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,140
You're not seeing it?

422
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,140
Where's your baldness?

423
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,140
I don't see your baldness.

424
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,140
I'm going bald!

425
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,140
Where's your bald?

426
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,140
I'm working on it.

427
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,140
Do you not see it on your screen?

428
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,140
I don't see it.

429
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,140
Try looking at the stream.

430
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,140
I don't see it on the stream either.

431
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,140
Where's your...

432
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,140
Oh wait, I'm behind.

433
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,140
I'm behind.

434
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,140
Oh my god.

435
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,140
Ew, you look disgusting.

436
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,140
I didn't realize I was like behind.

437
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,140
I forgot that YouTube does that where it like puts you behind.

438
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,140
Oh, ew.

439
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,140
You look really gross.

440
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,140
You look foul.

441
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,140
I don't like the shadows look disgusting.

442
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,140
You look like there's something wrong with you.

443
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,140
I don't want you to be my little sister anymore.

444
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,140
You're like one of those helmet babies.

445
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,140
Helmet babies? What's that?

446
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,140
Have you seen the babies with the helmet?

447
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,140
No.

448
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,140
Because they have like a dented head.

449
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,140
Because from like being left to me down for two months.

450
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,140
So they need to like shape their hands back to normal.

451
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,140
Oh, so you put the helmets on them.

452
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,140
And that's what you look like.

453
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,140
I do have some dents sometimes.

454
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,140
You're right.

455
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,140
When I turn right, you can see my head.

456
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,140
Well, let me see your bald head.

457
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,140
Are you any better?

458
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,140
Huh?

459
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,140
Wait, I actually don't...

460
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,140
I've never seen myself bald before.

461
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,140
Okay, wait.

462
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,140
Become bald with me.

463
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,140
Wait, I don't want to do this on this one.

464
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,140
Because then it's too much work.

465
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,140
They do have the other...

466
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,140
Wait, let me...

467
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,140
Let me respawn.

468
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,140
Respawn.

469
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,140
Because I have the others that is just the head.

470
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,140
I don't want to have to unhide.

471
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,140
Hide and unhide.

472
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,140
Hide and unhide everything.

473
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,140
It's too much work.

474
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,140
I have one that's just my head.

475
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,140
Okay, show me your head.

476
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,140
Wait, okay.

477
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,140
Do you see this?

478
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,140
Does everyone see this?

479
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,140
No.

480
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,140
Don't see this.

481
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,140
I will wait for them to see this.

482
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,140
For you to see this, okay?

483
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,140
I look really scary.

484
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,140
I look really scary just to warn you.

485
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,140
This version is not for the faint of heart.

486
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,140
I'm ready.

487
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,140
I'm just a hand.

488
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,140
I'm going to become a bald hand.

489
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,140
I'm going to become a bald hand, okay?

490
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,140
Okay.

491
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,140
So you can...

492
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,140
We can be bald together.

493
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,140
We can be bald together.

494
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,140
Where's the...

495
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,140
Wait, why do I forget how to do this?

496
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,140
I literally know how to do this.

497
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,140
I found the bald button.

498
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,140
Okay.

499
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,140
Do it.

500
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,140
Do you see me?

501
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,140
I see you.

502
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,140
Oh, I'm still not reloaded.

503
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,140
It's going to take me so long to reload.

504
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,140
Oh, no.

505
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,140
I'm going to get so fucking jumpscared.

506
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,140
I see you.

507
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,140
I see you.

508
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,140
I see you.

509
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,140
Oh, no!

510
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,140
No!

511
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,140
Yeah, I'm just...

512
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,140
Whoa!

513
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,140
Yeah, I'm just the head with tentacles.

514
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,140
Yeah, show me your baldness.

515
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,140
Okay, I'll start.

516
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,140
There.

517
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,140
And then here.

518
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,140
I'm working on it.

519
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,140
I'm working on it.

520
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,140
I'll keep making myself bald, too.

521
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,140
There.

522
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,140
We will go bald together.

523
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,140
There.

524
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,140
Shaving stream.

525
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,140
Head shaving stream.

526
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,140
You have ears.

527
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,140
I literally...

528
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,140
Like, I don't have ears.

529
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,140
Now you see.

530
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,140
I don't have ears.

531
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,140
I don't have ears.

532
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,140
Wait.

533
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,140
All of your hair is still there for me.

534
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,140
Oh, no.

535
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,140
Oh, fuck.

536
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,140
Does it not show up?

537
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,140
Wait.

538
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,140
Oh, no.

539
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,140
You can send me a screenshot.

540
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,140
Okay.

541
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,140
Oh.

542
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,140
I wonder why that is.

543
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,140
I guess this stuff doesn't show up on the...

544
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,140
Just share it.

545
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,140
Yeah, I'll share my YouTube studio with you.

546
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:03,140
And then maybe you can share it with the pinballs.

547
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,140
The pinballs might like it.

548
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,140
Yes.

549
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,140
Absolutely.

550
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,140
I'm almost becoming bald.

551
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,140
Me, too.

552
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,140
Me, too.

553
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,140
We're getting there.

554
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:17,140
Or maybe it'll update so everyone can see my baldness.

555
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,140
I look fucking terrifying.

556
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,140
Absolutely disgusting.

557
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,140
Don't worry.

558
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,140
I look just as bad.

559
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,140
I look like I need to be killed.

560
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,140
Are you allowed to say that on YouTube?

561
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,140
I don't know.

562
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,140
You can say it anyways though.

563
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,140
I don't care.

564
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,140
Oh, shit.

565
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,140
You're so fucking cool.

566
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,140
Okay.

567
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,140
Okay.

568
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,140
I'm bald.

569
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,140
Ew.

570
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,140
Ew.

571
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,140
It looks so disgusting.

572
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,140
I don't see it.

573
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,140
It looks so disgusting.

574
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,140
You're sharing it with me.

575
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,140
On Discord.

576
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,140
Okay.

577
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,140
I'm sharing with you.

578
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,140
Look at me.

579
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,140
Ew.

580
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,140
Do you see this?

581
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,140
Oh, it's not that bad.

582
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,140
It's not that bad.

583
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,140
Here, hold on.

584
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,140
Let me...

585
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,140
I look like a foul beast.

586
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,140
I look like a foul beast.

587
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,140
No, you look cute.

588
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,140
You're literally bullying me.

589
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,140
I'm not bullying you.

590
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,140
I'm saying you look cute.

591
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,140
Look at her.

592
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,140
She's so cute with her bald head.

593
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,140
You're weak with your people together.

594
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,140
What about when you see it with the tentacles?

595
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,140
How does it feel?

596
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,140
Is this like T.O.S.?

597
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,140
Why would it be T.O.S.?

598
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,140
I don't know.

599
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,140
Maybe it's like T.O.S.

600
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,140
No.

601
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:44,140
It's just like body horror T.O.S.

602
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,140
It's not horror.

603
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,140
It looks cute.

604
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,140
We're two bald babes.

605
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,140
Bald...

606
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,140
Yeah.

607
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,140
Bald together.

608
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,140
But also not bald together for some reason.

609
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,140
We come bald together.

610
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,140
We're both together in spirit.

611
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,140
Yeah.

612
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,140
Yeah.

613
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,140
I don't know why because they literally took off all this stuff.

614
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:11,140
It looks like my tentacles tickle your bald head.

615
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,140
I want them to tickle your bald head.

616
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,140
Wait.

617
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,140
Oh my God.

618
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,140
It's disgusting.

619
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,140
Yo.

620
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,140
Wait.

621
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,140
If I put them behind your bald head.

622
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,140
Let me position them.

623
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,140
Wait.

624
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,140
Ew.

625
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,140
Wait.

626
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,140
Now this looks like you.

627
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,140
Wait.

628
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,140
Now I just have tentacles.

629
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,140
No.

630
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,140
It looks so cute.

631
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,140
Wait.

632
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,140
Ignore my legs.

633
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,140
Ignore my legs.

634
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,140
Ignore my bald head.

635
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,140
There.

636
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,140
You belong to T.O.S.

637
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,140
You belong to T.O.S.

638
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,140
You should have given your tentacles to Strani.

639
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,140
I feel like she's the one that needs tentacles more.

640
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,140
She has some on the video in the background.

641
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,140
But you can't really see them because they're really dark.

642
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,140
I take up a lot of space.

643
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,140
I look really imposing like this.

644
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,140
Actually they look quite threatening and cool.

645
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,140
The more I see myself bald the more I kind of like it.

646
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,140
Yeah.

647
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,140
You should stay bald forever.

648
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,140
Just like a bald floating head.

649
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,140
Yeah.

650
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,140
Become bald forever.

651
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,140
Yeah.

652
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,140
Still just a head.

653
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,140
I forgot that they just still see just a head.

654
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,140
Okay.

655
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,140
Let me.

656
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,140
I don't remember which one.

657
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,140
I think this is the right one.

658
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,140
I'm just putting it.

659
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,140
I'm the final real V3.

660
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,140
I don't know this was it.

661
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,140
I'm putting all my hair back now.

662
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,140
No.

663
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,140
This isn't it.

664
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,140
That one is not it.

665
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,140
Ignore that.

666
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,140
Ignore that.

667
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,140
Chad you didn't see that.

668
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,140
Chad.

669
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,140
Don't.

670
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,140
Don't.

671
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,140
Don't.

672
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,140
Don't.

673
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,140
That one's not it.

674
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,140
That one's not it.

675
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,140
So I don't really feel this.

676
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,140
Yeah.

677
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,140
That's me.

678
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,140
I'm loading I'm spawning.

679
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,140
No.

680
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,140
It's the bald one again.

681
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,140
I didn't mean to be bald.

682
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,140
I don't want the bald nothing fish.

683
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,140
Take your time.

684
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,140
Take it.

685
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,140
Take it.

686
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,140
I can.

687
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,140
You should follow me.

688
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,140
Take it under your eyes.

689
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:15,460
I can appreciate a bulb then for fish there's no pressure to become to grow

690
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,780
hair there you are

691
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:27,660
I'm back. I'm normal now. I'm normal again. I'm normal. I was always normal. Yeah you

692
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,700
Nothing happened

693
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,220
Oops I grew. I didn't mean to be bald again.

694
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,220
Oh my god my eyes are so big and bulky.

695
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:55,220
I make big eyes. You like big anime girl eyes?

696
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:01,940
Yeah, I like to make them like fucking huge. It just feels right and you just have a face

697
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:08,380
that was meant for big fucking you guys. I do have really big big eyes don't I?

698
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:14,380
Yeah, maybe these are like too big. Maybe I want too big with it. I don't know.

699
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:23,380
And there's no such thing as too big. I like big eyes. Very mowing.

700
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Big beautiful eyes.

701
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:37,500
Playing with my bald head ASMR is POV slapping your bald head ASMR.

702
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,500
That's like such a good idea for an ASMR video. What do you mean?

703
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Bald people are really scary though.

704
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,620
You're afraid of bald people?

705
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:56,620
Yeah well the ones with the shiny hands. I'm scared of them when their hands are shiny.

706
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,620
Why?

707
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:02,620
Because it's like why is there they like must oil them up right?

708
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,620
You think bald people with shiny heads oil up their heads?

709
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:14,620
Yeah which makes it scary because I like think about this guy like wakes up and he oils like his bald head.

710
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,740
Yeah what a fucking loser. He wakes up and oils his bald head.

711
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,740
I don't think it's a loser. I just think it seems like a scary sort of person.

712
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:29,740
I don't want to think about the kind of person that wakes up and rubs the oil on their bald head.

713
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:34,740
I need my bald head to be shiny today.

714
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:41,740
You think they got some weird morals? They're focusing on the wrong things in life?

715
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,740
Yeah just like why are you waking up and oiling your heads?

716
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,740
Yeah but why are you polishing it?

717
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,740
I don't want them to polish it.

718
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:01,740
It makes you uncomfortable to look at it? Do you see your reflection in their bald shiny head?

719
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:08,740
Sometimes but also I think I just like I don't know the idea of like oiling up my head personally makes me uncomfortable.

720
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:16,740
Like hair oil like makes sense but I think about like putting oil on my bald head and this seems really unpleasant.

721
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,740
Well maybe they just have a really they might have a really dry scalp you know?

722
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,740
How does it feel? How do you think it feels?

723
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,740
Having a dry scalp?

724
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:34,740
No like wheeling. Imagine like the feeling of your hands like wheeling up your bald head.

725
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:39,740
You could do ASMR oiling my bald head.

726
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:48,740
ASMR oiling up my bald head in the morning to prepare for my day.

727
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,740
Yeah.

728
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,740
Of making everyone uncomfortable with my oily bald head.

729
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,740
Yeah it's disgusting.

730
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,740
You could be some gross and bald.

731
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:09,740
The reason bald heads are shiny is because the head naturally produces oil. People aren't oiling their heads.

732
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,740
Yeah that makes sense.

733
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:18,740
Yeah that does make more sense because like just like the image of somebody like oiling up their bald head.

734
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,740
That is a really scary sort of person.

735
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:26,740
I don't I agree. I agree with the chatter though. I don't think they're actually oiling themselves up.

736
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,740
I think it's just their um...

737
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,740
Yeah it's really true.

738
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,740
It's just their their head naturally producing the oil you know?

739
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,740
They don't do it on purpose.

740
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,740
Do you get like oily?

741
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:44,740
Oh I guess super oily. My hair is really oily. Do you not?

742
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:50,740
Yeah not really you know my hair is like I guess it's too like thick and curly.

743
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:56,740
It just gets very dry and my scalp is like it'll get itchy but it doesn't get oily.

744
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,740
It doesn't get greasy.

745
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,740
Oh what the hell you're so lucky. Mine gets super greasy and gross.

746
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,740
It is lucky.

747
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,740
My hair isn't shiny though because I don't get oily.

748
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:14,740
And if I had like a bald head I would just have the dry bald head that I would need the oil because I don't get oily myself.

749
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,740
But shiny doesn't look good. It looks greasy. It doesn't look shiny.

750
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,740
That's true.

751
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,740
Like it doesn't...

752
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,740
Oh it looks kinda cute. Oh you're drawing me in a honeymoon. Maybe I'll draw you in like a comfy fit.

753
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,740
Oh that'll be cute. No I like it. I'm dutching.

754
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,740
I'll give you your pens though.

755
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:40,740
I'm just drawing it in something simple but it's kind of awkwardly.

756
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,740
It's rough.

757
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,740
You like hoodies? That's good.

758
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,740
Coffee cardigan? I don't know.

759
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,740
Using all natural emi hair oil to cook your food.

760
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,740
You could deep fry in the amount of oil I produce in a week.

761
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,740
Meow meow meow.

762
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,740
You could deep fry some french fries in there.

763
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,740
Does that not sound tasty?

764
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,740
I don't like it.

765
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:33,740
No? You don't want to deep fry your french fries in my hair oil?

766
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,740
No.

767
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,740
Oh that's a shame.

768
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:42,740
Imagine McDonald's french fries with deep fried and emi oil.

769
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,740
What would you call them?

770
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,740
Emi fries.

771
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,740
Emi fries.

772
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,740
Frimmies. I don't know.

773
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,740
Frimmies?

774
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,740
Frimmies.

775
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,740
Frimmies. I like Frimmies.

776
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,740
Frimmie fries.

777
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,740
Frimmies.

778
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:06,740
I know there's a place I forget where but if you order like fries and onion rings they call them like rings.

779
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,740
That almost sounds like like frimmie.

780
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,740
Fring.

781
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,740
Frings?

782
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,740
Frings. Fries and onion rings together.

783
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,740
Oh I never heard of that.

784
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:31,740
Emifries with a side of emi need to wash it down? You are disgusting.

785
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:36,740
Disgusting. Disgusting. Ew.

786
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,740
Do you like milk?

787
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:50,740
Um not really. Like I like milk with um coffee but I don't like milk like alone really.

788
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,740
I like milk with other stuff basically but not alone.

789
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,740
Oh my god you drank me a little cardigan too. It's so cute.

790
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,740
No I thought that would fit. It was really comfy.

791
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,740
It was a bit the same. So comfy.

792
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,740
Mm-hmm.

793
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:15,740
My chat keeps getting me into trying to collaborate with um Canadian dairy farmers.

794
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,740
They're saying I need to I need to collaborate with Canadian dairy farmers.

795
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:24,740
Oh my god your chat's trying to milk you and they're trying to get you to sell your milk right? Is that what it's going on?

796
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,740
No. No they literally just want me to collaborate with like Canadian farmers for some reason.

797
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:34,740
It's like as a sponsor. They want me to be sponsored by big milk.

798
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:41,740
Wait so they don't want you to sell your milk? I thought they were trying to get you to sell your milk like in collaboration with dairy farmers.

799
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,740
Like they're trying to get you to get milked.

800
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,740
No they want me to be like be sponsored by the milk.

801
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,740
Huh are you a fan of milk? Are you a big milk milk fan?

802
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,740
Not at all. I'm very lactose intolerant.

803
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,740
You're lactose intolerant?

804
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:06,740
Yeah unfortunately. I still like cheese a lot but it doesn't it doesn't love you know?

805
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:15,740
Mm-hmm that sucks. Yeah why is your chat trying to get you to collab with Canadian dairy farmers if you're lactose intolerant?

806
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:21,740
I guess you could you could you could make your own like special flavor of lactose free milk with them.

807
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,740
Then put flavor to lactose free.

808
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,740
I don't want to be the first VTuber with the Canadian dairy farms sponsorship.

809
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,740
I can do it with you. We can both do it.

810
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:38,740
The Canadian dairy farm VTubers.

811
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,740
Yeah the first VTubers.

812
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:46,740
The first VTubers that collabed with Canadian dairy farms.

813
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:55,740
Yeah VTuber dairy farmer collab. Let's fucking go. There's a totally huge market for this.

814
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,740
I bet there is. I'm sure lots of people would want to buy our milk.

815
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,740
Yeah it's an untapped market.

816
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:13,740
I'm struggling so hard with your sweater here I'm gonna move on to something else.

817
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,740
You know when these are hard to draw.

818
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,740
I don't know how to draw.

819
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,740
If it means wait oh go ahead.

820
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,740
Amigo?

821
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,740
Yeah you go.

822
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:49,740
I was just gonna read a chat message that says when Amy gets a gamer subs flavor is it emi milk or emi nade?

823
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,740
Neither! Neither! Neither!

824
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,740
The idea of like a milk energy drink seems a bit disgusting.

825
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:05,740
I don't know if it exists. I'm sure it probably is like one of the name flavors or flavor names but I don't know.

826
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,740
Milk. Gamer milk. Gamer milk, Gamer subs.

827
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:19,740
Gamer milk sounds disgusting. Gamer milk is the name.

828
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:28,740
How do I move my whole drawing here? There we go. Give you some more space.

829
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,740
Let me give you thigh highs because it's cute.

830
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,740
It is cute. I like thigh highs.

831
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,740
Gamer emi nade or we riot? Riot then.

832
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:57,740
Oh wait I just realized it's the gamer thing because it's like oh the lemonade.

833
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:02,740
Oh wait I think I get it not a whole though. I was wondering why lemonade. I thought maybe you just like lemonade.

834
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,740
No it's piss.

835
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,740
You didn't know it was piss?

836
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:13,740
No I'm just I well I realized but only like just just now.

837
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:21,740
You poor innocent soul. No emi nade is piss. It's not lemonade.

838
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:25,740
That's why it's called like emi nade because it's yellow.

839
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,740
It looks like lemonade but it's not. It's pee.

840
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:44,740
You've been you've been corrupted now.

841
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,740
Why would you do this to me?

842
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,740
I didn't do anything.

843
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,740
I thought you were innocent. I thought you were innocent vtuber.

844
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,740
You thought we were innocent vtubers?

845
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,740
Yes.

846
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,740
Oh shit I'm glad I was able to trick you at least.

847
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,740
Say so.

848
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,740
No I never claimed to be anything.

849
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,740
That's your own fault for coming up with those conclusions.

850
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,740
Well you just look innocent.

851
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,740
I do I've been told that.

852
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,740
Say so company. Does she know?

853
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,740
No.

854
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,740
Do I know what?

855
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,740
What do you mean do you know? Do you know?

856
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,740
What do I know? What do I not know? What don't I know?

857
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,740
Does she know? Do you know what we do?

858
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,740
What do you do?

859
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,740
Do you introduce yourself to the chat?

860
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,740
I don't have to introduce myself to the chat right now?

861
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,740
Yeah you can introduce yourself.

862
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,740
Oh my god okay hi.

863
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,740
I'm Amy V.

864
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,740
From Bieler's Generation 1 in Dolce.

865
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:08,740
And Bieler is the first

866
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,740
English AVtuber company

867
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:19,740
which means we are the first English company to focus on making porn.

868
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,740
There we go.

869
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,740
What is porn?

870
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,740
What is porn?

871
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,740
What is porn?

872
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,740
What is porn? Oh my god.

873
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,740
Chat you're gonna have to you're gonna have to

874
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,740
you're gonna have to grab the the wheel right now.

875
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,740
You're gonna have to take over chat.

876
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:43,740
Can we explain to Tenville what's porn?

877
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,740
What's short for popcorn?

878
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,740
Wait that's so awesome you guys are a popcorn company.

879
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,740
It's corn but with a P.

880
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,740
Popcorn.

881
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,740
Popcorn.

882
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,740
What's your favorite kind of...

883
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,740
Oh that's why you kind of look like a popcorn kernel.

884
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,740
I wear your hands kind of like a popcorn.

885
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,740
You're right.

886
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,740
No don't don't you're popcorn detubers.

887
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,740
You're like a popcorn kernel.

888
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,740
Your hair is like a freshly popped kernel.

889
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,740
And then the little brown things are the kernels themselves.

890
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,740
The kernels before becoming popcorns.

891
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,740
Exactly.

892
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,740
Yeah.

893
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,740
We're popcorn v-tubers.

894
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,740
Popcorn.

895
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:38,740
Do you have a favorite type of popcorn Denpa?

896
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,740
I like...

897
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,740
I'm actually not really a big popcorn fan to be honest.

898
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,740
I'm not particularly fond.

899
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,740
Really?

900
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,740
Yeah.

901
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,740
I'm not big on it.

902
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,740
I guess...

903
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,740
I like classic like butter.

904
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:00,740
Maybe in like dill pickle or like salt and vinegar flavor powdering.

905
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,740
But then I don't know.

906
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,740
I'm not really a big popcorn person.

907
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,740
I like savory stuff though.

908
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,740
I'm a pretty big popcorn person.

909
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,740
Do you know kernels?

910
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,740
Kernels?

911
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,740
Yeah like the brand that does like the weird popcorn.

912
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,740
I've heard of it.

913
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,740
I'm a big kernels fan.

914
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,740
You haven't had kernels?

915
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,740
I haven't had them like I've seen them.

916
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,740
But I haven't tried it because it's popcorn.

917
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,740
Like I'm already not like a big popcorn fan.

918
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,740
You should try kernels.

919
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,740
We should go get kernels together one day.

920
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,740
It's freaking delicious.

921
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,740
I love kernels.

922
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,740
They have a bunch of really good flavors of popcorn.

923
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,740
Isn't like sweet though?

924
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,740
I don't really like like a sweet popcorn.

925
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,740
I like caramel corn.

926
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,740
I hate that too.

927
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,740
I hate that too.

928
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,740
I hate it.

929
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,740
I love snacks but I fucking hate that.

930
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,740
That is one thing I like refuse to eat.

931
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,740
It's fucking foul.

932
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,740
It's so disgusting and it's so popular too.

933
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,740
That's why it's everywhere.

934
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,740
It's like everyone loves that type of popcorn for some reason.

935
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,740
I hate it.

936
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,740
I hate it.

937
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,740
Like both the texture and like the flavor itself.

938
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,740
But I think it's mostly like the textures.

939
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,740
It's awful.

940
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,740
Not really like a big fan of caramel.

941
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,740
I guess in general.

942
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,740
But like the texture of caramel corn.

943
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,740
It's horrible.

944
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,740
It's awful.

945
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,740
I don't know what you mean.

946
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,740
I know what you mean.

947
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,740
What kind of flavors does kernels have?

948
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,740
I mean like savory and like sweet.

949
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,740
Yeah there's a lot of savory flavors.

950
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,740
They have like um

951
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,740
different types of cheese flavors.

952
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,740
They do have dill pickle.

953
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,740
I tried their pickle it was pretty good.

954
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,740
And I usually don't like pickle flavored things.

955
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,740
They have like um

956
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,740
they have spicy flavored popcorn

957
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,740
which is really good too.

958
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,740
That sounds really good.

959
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,740
I would probably like something with that.

960
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,740
Do you like spicy things?

961
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,740
Is that why you've been eating the spicy

962
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,740
um beans?

963
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,740
The spicy jelly beans?

964
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,740
Oh yeah I got them.

965
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,740
Sometimes because it just like

966
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,740
gives me a bit of a quick thrill.

967
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,740
But yeah no I spilled them all over the floor

968
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,740
before I was streaming.

969
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,740
And I had to like

970
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,740
be right back because I had to pick up the beans off my floor.

971
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,740
It's like Fiery 5 jelly belly ones.

972
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,740
And me was making fun of me.

973
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,740
She called me disgusting pig.

974
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,740
I did not say that!

975
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,740
What?

976
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,740
She did.

977
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,740
I didn't call you anything.

978
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,740
You told me to come over

979
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,740
and eat the jelly beans off of your floor.

980
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,740
Do you want to?

981
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,740
No.

982
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,740
I don't like spicy jelly beans.

983
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,740
You eat spicy popcorn.

984
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,740
Yeah but that's different.

985
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,740
It's like flavorful.

986
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,740
But jelly beans are sweet right?

987
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,740
Yeah but these are spicy.

988
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,740
There's no sweetness.

989
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,740
There's no sweetness at all?

990
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,740
No it's just hot.

991
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,740
It's just hot jelly beans.

992
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,740
That sounds gross.

993
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,740
They are.

994
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,740
They are.

995
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,740
They are. You should try them.

996
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,740
It's disgusting you should try it.

997
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,740
You don't want to suffer alone

998
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,740
eating those nasty jelly beans?

999
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,740
No I want you to suffer with me.

1000
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,740
Better to suffer with somebody else.

1001
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,740
I guess it is.

1002
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,740
Yeah.

1003
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,740
Okay.

1004
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,740
I'm really struggling to make this arm look good

1005
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,740
but I think I'm going to color it too now.

1006
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,740
Yeah.

1007
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,740
I guess cleaning.

1008
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,740
I do have so many sketches and I sketch

1009
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,740
and then I sketch and then I sketch.

1010
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,740
It's just slowly like adding more.

1011
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,740
I think now I'm like

1012
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,740
this is like my clean clean sketch.

1013
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,740
This is like your third sketch now?

1014
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,740
Yeah.

1015
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,740
Because I started like super

1016
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:08,740
super loosely.

1017
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,740
Kind of build up I guess.

1018
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,740
I wasn't sure.

1019
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,740
I guess it comes back to like as I was saying

1020
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,740
the first time you draw a character

1021
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,740
it just feels so awkward because

1022
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,740
you're focused mostly on getting the design right

1023
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,740
and then I switch to the sweater and I'm like

1024
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,740
you know what this is better.

1025
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,740
Let's focus on like the little details.

1026
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,740
How do I

1027
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,740
make it so that I can only draw

1028
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,740
on the layered self?

1029
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,740
Like only draw on whatever I've already

1030
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,740
drawn on.

1031
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,740
I don't know how to explain myself.

1032
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,740
No I think I know.

1033
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,740
It's the lock button.

1034
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,740
The lock button.

1035
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,740
But it doesn't work.

1036
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,740
Oh no.

1037
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,740
Wait.

1038
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,740
Maybe I'm using the wrong layer.

1039
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:56,740
Wait what?

1040
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,740
I actually forget how to do

1041
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,740
you mean alpha lock right?

1042
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,740
I think that is the button that does it on this program.

1043
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,740
Yeah.

1044
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,740
You don't remember.

1045
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:08,740
Alpha lock.

1046
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,740
What?

1047
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,740
I forget how

1048
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,740
I literally forget how we

1049
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,740
what the fuck how do I do it?

1050
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,740
Opacity lock? Masking layer?

1051
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,740
Yeah something like that like a masking layer.

1052
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,740
Because I used to be able to do that.

1053
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,740
Where is it now?

1054
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:26,740
Oh wait I think

1055
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,740
Is that it?

1056
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,740
Oh it's the little

1057
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,740
It's the what?

1058
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,740
It's the new screenshot. I found the button.

1059
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,740
Okay.

1060
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,740
It's

1061
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,740
Okay.

1062
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,740
This is like so fucking weird and

1063
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,740
hidden but it's the one next to the layer

1064
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,740
opacity and you click the lock.

1065
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,740
The little square.

1066
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,740
Oh I see it. Okay thank you.

1067
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,740
Thank you.

1068
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,740
I'm just learning. I'm just learning

1069
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,740
that that is where it is for myself too.

1070
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,740
That's better.

1071
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,740
It's a really weird place to have it.

1072
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,740
It is.

1073
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,740
I handsily

1074
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,740
look around because it's a queen.

1075
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,740
Oh shit.

1076
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,740
Now is there an airbrush button too?

1077
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,740
You need to

1078
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,740
you need to change the brush.

1079
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,740
So there's like other brush settings

1080
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,740
so it'll be like a softer brush.

1081
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,740
If you scroll down there's like

1082
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,740
Oh my brushes.

1083
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,740
Oh no that's not it.

1084
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,740
There's plus and then there's like general

1085
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,740
and then there's like soft, softer

1086
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,740
softer. Okay.

1087
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,740
Thank you.

1088
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,740
I can't believe that you birth on stream.

1089
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,740
I was really shocked when I heard you birth.

1090
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,740
What?

1091
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,740
What do you mean you can't believe I birth?

1092
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,740
I just can't believe you do it.

1093
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,740
Do you not do it?

1094
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,740
I don't birth on stream.

1095
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,740
I never live.

1096
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,740
Why not?

1097
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,740
I don't know. I just don't like it. It scares me.

1098
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,740
Are you afraid of people like

1099
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,740
judging you for burping on stream?

1100
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,740
No I think like

1101
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,740
caring in. I was fine with you doing it

1102
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,740
because like you're cute but usually I just

1103
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,740
feel scared when like people burp.

1104
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,740
You're afraid of people burping?

1105
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,740
Yeah.

1106
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,740
It's just like really scary.

1107
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,740
Are you one of those people that think burping

1108
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,740
is like gross?

1109
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,740
I guess so but also I think it's

1110
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,740
almost like I'm afraid they're gonna like throw up.

1111
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,740
Oh.

1112
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,740
Do you have a fear of like throwing up?

1113
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,740
I think so. Just a bit.

1114
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,740
I think just a bit.

1115
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,740
Like are you are you afraid that

1116
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,740
when you hear the sound of someone throwing up

1117
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,740
you're gonna throw up too?

1118
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,740
Yeah and I'm like oh my god they're gonna like throw up.

1119
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,740
It's gonna throw up.

1120
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,740
Oh.

1121
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,740
So when they're burping it sounds like

1122
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,740
oh my god like they're gonna puke.

1123
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,740
Mmm.

1124
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,740
Okay.

1125
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,740
You would not like

1126
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,740
you would not like some of the stuff

1127
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,740
I've posted on Twitter then.

1128
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,740
I've heard some of it.

1129
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,740
They click off and it gets scary.

1130
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,740
It gets scary.

1131
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,740
That's okay.

1132
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,740
It's pretty scary. It can get pretty scary.

1133
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,740
Yeah.

1134
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,740
It's really terrifying.

1135
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,740
I don't want you to throw up.

1136
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:28,740
I started worrying. I feel bad.

1137
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,740
Oh my goodness she's sick and she's going to die.

1138
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,740
Don't feel bad.

1139
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,740
I'm fine.

1140
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,740
Don't worry.

1141
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,740
Everyone's always worrying about you though.

1142
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,740
Especially when it comes to ice.

1143
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,740
They think you're gonna like kill yourself.

1144
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,740
Yeah they think I'm gonna

1145
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,740
Are you allowed to say that word on YouTube?

1146
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,740
I keep worrying. I said something like Q.S.

1147
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,740
Say what? Ice?

1148
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,740
The K word.

1149
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,740
Oh.

1150
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,740
Kill myself?

1151
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,740
Just K.

1152
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,740
K I L L.

1153
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,740
Are you allowed to say that?

1154
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,740
Oh I don't know but I say it anyways.

1155
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,740
Like literally half of my VODs

1156
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,740
are limited ads but I don't care

1157
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,740
I just don't really make money anyways.

1158
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,740
So say whatever you want. It's okay.

1159
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,740
Oh okay I thought it would get like your

1160
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,740
You're like suspended.

1161
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,740
No.

1162
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,740
I mean if that happens it happens whatever.

1163
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,740
It's okay.

1164
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,740
I didn't know.

1165
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,740
I just think yeah I have a bit of the tiktok

1166
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,740
because I know you're not allowed to say stuff like that on there.

1167
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,740
I don't stream on tiktok

1168
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,740
but I was thinking

1169
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,740
like maybe YouTube is like that.

1170
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,740
YouTube is pretty strict. It's annoying.

1171
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,740
It's like

1172
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,740
you can say so much on Twitch

1173
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,740
and on YouTube if you say the same stuff

1174
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,740
your like video is gonna get

1175
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,740
limited ads or

1176
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,740
or even like

1177
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:52,740
taken down.

1178
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,740
Yeah. Yeah I'm very paranoid.

1179
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,740
I didn't really use YouTube much

1180
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,740
until recently I've been posting

1181
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,740
more. I'm like

1182
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,740
I'm so confused about like what gets

1183
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,740
limited.

1184
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,740
Didn't you have a video where you

1185
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,740
like it was like

1186
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,740
sucking on a popsicle until it's gone?

1187
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,740
What happened to it? I saw it wasn't up anymore.

1188
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,740
I got

1189
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,740
scared so I got rid of it

1190
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,740
because I was afraid YouTube would kill me for it.

1191
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,740
I don't know if they will.

1192
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,740
You can't rid of it for now anyways

1193
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,740
because I'm like what if they kill my channel

1194
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,740
for it. Like it's been up but

1195
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,740
maybe they'll change their mind.

1196
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,740
Oh.

1197
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,740
You took it down because you were afraid

1198
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,740
they were gonna like remove your channel for it?

1199
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,740
Yeah.

1200
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,740
I don't want them to kill me.

1201
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,740
No.

1202
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,740
If they didn't take it down when you first

1203
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,740
uploaded it it was probably fine.

1204
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,740
Really?

1205
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,740
Yeah I'll leave it. I mean I don't

1206
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,740
don't blame me if something happens to your channel

1207
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,740
but I would have left it up.

1208
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,740
You're gonna be like

1209
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:56,740
mass reporting me.

1210
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,740
I would not mass report you.

1211
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,740
No.

1212
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,740
No.

1213
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,740
I don't know.

1214
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,740
Maybe I'll put it back.

1215
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,740
I don't know. I just got scared.

1216
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,740
It got so popular though. People loved it.

1217
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,740
But what if my YouTube gets killed?

1218
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,740
No.

1219
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,740
They give you a warning first.

1220
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,740
Oh.

1221
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,740
I thought like it's just over.

1222
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,740
No no no. They give you a warning

1223
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,740
and then

1224
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,740
if you fuck up again they give you a strike

1225
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,740
and then if you fuck up again they give you another strike

1226
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,740
and then if you fuck up again they give you a third strike

1227
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,740
and you might be out after the third strike

1228
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,740
I don't know.

1229
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,740
I just feel as if I made your eyes way too fucking big.

1230
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,740
I'm like what the fuck?

1231
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:40,740
I'm like blind.

1232
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,740
I turned you into a bug.

1233
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,740
What the fuck? I'm cooked.

1234
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,740
My brain is cooked.

1235
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,740
I just need to make the irises smaller.

1236
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,740
I don't know what the fuck I was cooking.

1237
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,740
It's okay.

1238
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,740
I like actually

1239
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,740
looked at him like oh fuck.

1240
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,740
What am I doing?

1241
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,740
I got those big bug eyes.

1242
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,740
Those beautiful big unsettling bug eyes.

1243
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,740
I want them to be big but not that big.

1244
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,740
Not that big.

1245
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:08,740
Not that big.

1246
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,740
Okay this is better I think.

1247
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,740
I think this is like less.

1248
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,740
Yeah.

1249
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:16,740
Okay. I think this looks better.

1250
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,740
You saw it before right? This is like less.

1251
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,740
Bucketing.

1252
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,740
Bucketing.

1253
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,740
Oh my cat.

1254
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,740
What is he doing?

1255
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,740
What? Like what's the mean?

1256
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,740
He doesn't like you the mean.

1257
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:32,740
You like him me.

1258
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,740
Hello?

1259
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,740
What was your cat's name again? I forgot.

1260
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,740
It was something cute like lemon?

1261
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:40,740
Yeah. That's him.

1262
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,740
His name was Lemon?

1263
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,740
Yeah.

1264
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,740
Oh my god hi Lemon.

1265
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,740
He left already. He doesn't.

1266
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,740
He's scared of you.

1267
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,740
I am pretty scary.

1268
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,740
I understand.

1269
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,740
You have to teach me how to use this score.

1270
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,740
Because I couldn't guess all the other work.

1271
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,740
Oh.

1272
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,740
I'm confused again.

1273
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,740
Did I accidentally draw on the wrong layer?

1274
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,740
What am I doing wrong here?

1275
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,740
It.

1276
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,740
I can't do it.

1277
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:12,740
The hair looks like it's all the same layer.

1278
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,740
Like the hair coloring.

1279
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,740
No I drew some of the hair on the wrong layer.

1280
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,740
I'm copying it right now.

1281
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,740
This is layer 2 copy.

1282
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,740
I don't know.

1283
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,740
What the fuck?

1284
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:26,740
What is happening?

1285
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,740
Huh?

1286
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,740
I hate this program.

1287
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,740
What the fuck?

1288
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,740
No.

1289
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,740
This video is not sponsored.

1290
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:38,740
This video is not sponsored.

1291
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,740
We need you to fix your

1292
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,740
fucking website.

1293
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,740
You're listening.

1294
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,740
They're definitely not listening.

1295
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,740
Wait maybe they are. Maybe they're listening.

1296
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,740
I wish they were.

1297
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,740
If Magma people are listening.

1298
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,740
Help.

1299
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,740
Well no let me help you.

1300
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,740
I have a lot of ideas for you.

1301
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,740
Yeah.

1302
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:02,740
And the first one is to fix all the bugs.

1303
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:04,740
Yeah.

1304
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,740
There we go. Fix all of them.

1305
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,740
And also what the fuck is

1306
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,740
the opacity lock button? That is so weird.

1307
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,740
Why is it like

1308
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,740
a weird hidden toggle next to the

1309
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,740
layer opacity?

1310
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,740
I've never seen it like that before.

1311
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:20,740
I don't think any other program has it

1312
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,740
in that area.

1313
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,740
Very strange.

1314
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,740
Very strange.

1315
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,740
I think I'm getting it.

1316
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,740
Watch me have to redraw the whole thing

1317
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,740
because I didn't get it.

1318
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,740
Okay I think I fixed it.

1319
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,740
There. Now it's all in the right layer.

1320
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,740
Yeah.

1321
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:50,740
Amy draws the thumbnail

1322
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,740
to her ASMR. Yes I will.

1323
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,740
I will be drawing.

1324
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,740
Ten put do you want me to include that you're drawing

1325
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,740
in the thumbnail for our collab too?

1326
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,740
Yeah.

1327
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,740
If you like it. If it's ugly then don't add it.

1328
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,740
No we can

1329
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,740
include both drawings. It's okay.

1330
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,740
Yeah I don't want it if it's ugly.

1331
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,740
It shouldn't be in it.

1332
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:14,740
It's just that I would want it to be finished.

1333
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,740
Do you think you could finish it or no?

1334
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,740
I think I could.

1335
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,740
I'm not sure what considers like a finished drawing though.

1336
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,740
I usually like sketch.

1337
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,740
I think like

1338
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,740
I don't know. I guess

1339
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,740
like this plus colors

1340
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:30,740
and some rendering.

1341
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:32,740
That is dumb.

1342
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,740
We'll see. What do you consider

1343
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,740
finished?

1344
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,740
I consider finished to be like

1345
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,740
clean lines

1346
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:44,740
and clean shading.

1347
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,740
You know what I mean?

1348
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,740
The way I'm coloring

1349
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,740
I'm just coloring my own sketch right now.

1350
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:52,740
This isn't finished

1351
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,740
for me.

1352
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,740
Yeah

1353
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:58,740
all of a sudden you're like

1354
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,740
I could

1355
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,740
finish.

1356
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:04,740
This is starting to like fuck when I'm

1357
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,740
I'm really thinking this is

1358
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,740
kind of philosophical.

1359
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:10,740
What is a finished drawing?

1360
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,740
Yeah.

1361
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:14,740
What does it mean?

1362
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:16,740
What does it mean to finish a drawing?

1363
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,740
Yeah.

1364
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,740
Okay. I mean like

1365
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,740
I guess this is like a sketch

1366
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,740
but like this is like

1367
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:26,740
like a rendered sketch.

1368
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:28,740
Nor the fucked up eyes.

1369
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,740
I was suffering from

1370
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,740
heat.

1371
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:34,740
It's okay.

1372
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,740
I'm suffering from heat too right now.

1373
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,740
Okay.

1374
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,740
Onesan

1375
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:48,740
Onesan

1376
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,740
Onesan

1377
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,740
You can

1378
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:54,740
You can be the big sister.

1379
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,740
I feel like

1380
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,740
after actually talking to you

1381
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,740
I feel like you might be more mature than

1382
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,740
me in this game.

1383
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,740
You think I'm

1384
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,740
You have this picture you had to use discord.

1385
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,740
No.

1386
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,740
I'm more mature than you.

1387
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,740
No.

1388
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:14,740
Me? No.

1389
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,740
No.

1390
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,740
Big sister in me this is illegal.

1391
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:28,740
I always wanted to have

1392
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,740
a little sister.

1393
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,740
I'll be your little sister.

1394
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,740
Okay.

1395
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,740
For real.

1396
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,740
For real.

1397
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,740
For real.

1398
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,740
I need the tier

1399
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,740
of the

1400
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,740
tiered member subs.

1401
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,740
We know they're in membership tiers.

1402
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,740
Yeah. There's membership tiers on YouTube.

1403
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:54,740
I will

1404
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:56,740
subscribe tier.

1405
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:58,740
I will member tier membership

1406
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,740
tier on the highest tier.

1407
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:02,740
Why?

1408
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:04,740
Why would you do that?

1409
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,740
Because

1410
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,740
I was horny.

1411
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:14,740
That's why

1412
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,740
Huh?

1413
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:18,740
He's so confused about me.

1414
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,740
What is going on here?

1415
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:22,740
What the fuck?

1416
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,740
Did I like duplicate my layers?

1417
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,740
I'm so fucking confused.

1418
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,740
No. I'm confused. What?

1419
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,740
That's what I'm saying. It's really confusing to draw

1420
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,740
on this program.

1421
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,740
This is why you're literally...

1422
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:36,740
Is there anything on my layer 5?

1423
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,740
Layer 3.

1424
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:40,740
I hide. Layer 5.

1425
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,740
I have everything hidden,

1426
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,740
but it's still showing

1427
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,740
something. What if I delete it?

1428
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:50,740
I don't even know what I just deleted.

1429
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,740
What if I delete this? Okay.

1430
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:54,740
No, it's bugging. It's actually

1431
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:56,740
fucking bugging.

1432
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,740
This shit is actually fucking bugged.

1433
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,740
It is bugged.

1434
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:02,740
Well...

1435
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,740
It's fucking over.

1436
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:08,740
It's over.

1437
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:10,740
It's over.

1438
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,740
It's over.

1439
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,740
This program sucks. Why is it bugging?

1440
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,740
Literally, I deleted the layer.

1441
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,740
I still don't know what's going on here.

1442
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,740
As soon as it's bugging.

1443
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,740
As soon as it's bugging.

1444
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,740
Here we go.

1445
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:40,740
This sweater falling off her arm is so cute.

1446
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,740
Yeah, the way she drew it falling off is super cute.

1447
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:44,740
Thank you.

1448
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,740
I thought it would be like a cute touch.

1449
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,740
I really like armpits.

1450
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,740
I wanted to give like a touch of armpit.

1451
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,740
You like armpits?

1452
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,740
Yeah.

1453
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,740
I think it's just cute.

1454
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:58,740
It's nice to see it.

1455
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:00,740
It's nice when you can see a touch of armpit.

1456
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,740
You like seeing a touch of the armpit?

1457
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:04,740
What is that about armpits that you like?

1458
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,740
I don't know.

1459
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:08,740
It's just a touch of skin.

1460
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:10,740
It's cute when

1461
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,740
a girl is mostly covered

1462
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,740
but you just see

1463
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:16,740
a little bit of something

1464
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:18,740
and you're like, wow.

1465
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:20,740
It's very scandalous. It's just exciting.

1466
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:22,740
When a woman who's

1467
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,740
she's wearing a dress

1468
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:26,740
that covers everything but then it like falls off.

1469
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:28,740
You know, like imagine

1470
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,740
she's in a beautiful bridal gown.

1471
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:32,740
She's a beautiful bride

1472
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,740
and then her like sleeve

1473
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,740
slips so you see like a touch of her armpit.

1474
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,740
I see.

1475
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,740
Like an armpit fold.

1476
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,740
Oh.

1477
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:44,740
You understand all.

1478
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,740
Okay, it's scandalous.

1479
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:48,740
Like a nun.

1480
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:50,740
A nun with a little bit of armpit falling out.

1481
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:52,740
Yeah.

1482
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:54,740
Then you're like, oh my god.

1483
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:56,740
It's exciting.

1484
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:58,740
It is exciting.

1485
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,740
Okay, I get it.

1486
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:02,740
I get it.

1487
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,740
I'm not really sure how to explain it

1488
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,740
but then they can also be sweaty

1489
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,740
and they can also like that's just one

1490
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:14,740
aspect of makes them fucking awesome

1491
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:16,740
but there's also like, well

1492
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:18,740
there's so many different flavors of armpits.

1493
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,740
They can be sweaty. They can be like

1494
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,740
kind of

1495
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:24,740
what is it?

1496
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:26,740
Sexual innuendo.

1497
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:28,740
What's your favorite flavor of armpit?

1498
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:32,740
Armpit Aussie.

1499
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:34,740
Armpit Aussie?

1500
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,740
Yeah.

1501
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:38,740
What is armpit Aussie?

1502
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:40,740
It's like when it looks

1503
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,740
like there's like, okay.

1504
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,740
So let me just like

1505
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,740
add this to my drawing really quickly.

1506
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,740
Why is it not

1507
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:50,740
hiding this?

1508
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:52,740
See, I just like

1509
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,740
went in and I like

1510
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:56,740
draw these little folds

1511
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:58,740
and you just start to form like

1512
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:00,740
little armpit Aussie.

1513
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:02,740
Maybe you can do like a little like

1514
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,740
soft

1515
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:06,740
shading here

1516
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:08,740
that like gives a little touch and then you add

1517
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,740
like a little bit of shine and it's like

1518
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:12,740
there's like some armpit Aussie

1519
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:14,740
like that.

1520
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:16,740
I think I know what you mean.

1521
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,740
Yeah, I think I know what you mean.

1522
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:20,740
It's like really zoom in

1523
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,740
on that. It was zoom in on the

1524
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:24,740
armpit Aussie that I just drew.

1525
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:26,740
So you didn't get the vision.

1526
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:28,740
Zoom in. I zoomed in.

1527
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:30,740
Do you guys get the armpit Aussie

1528
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,740
vision?

1529
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:34,740
Yeah, it's just like the little

1530
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,740
little detail.

1531
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:38,740
It's a little armpit.

1532
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,740
It's a little armpit Aussie.

1533
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,740
Yeah, you don't get to see

1534
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:44,740
her cleavage but you get to see

1535
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:46,740
her armpit. Isn't that good enough for you?

1536
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,740
It is. For me, yeah.

1537
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:50,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1538
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,740
No cleavage but you get

1539
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,740
a bit of the armpit. So it's like exciting.

1540
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:56,740
Like I don't get the tits but I get the armpit.

1541
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,740
Awesome.

1542
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,740
I mean the armpit, who needs

1543
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:02,740
tits when you got armpit, you know?

1544
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:04,740
Exactly, literally exactly.

1545
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:06,740
Why pussy when armpit?

1546
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:08,740
Just...

1547
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:10,740
Just use the pit.

1548
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:12,740
Just use the pit.

1549
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:14,740
Just use the tits. It's so powerful.

1550
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:20,740
It's like set-tie

1551
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:22,740
really?

1552
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,740
What's that?

1553
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,740
It's like the tie-high.

1554
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:28,740
It's also happening in this image.

1555
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,740
It's the gap between the

1556
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:32,740
tie and the tie-high.

1557
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,740
That's what it's called?

1558
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:36,740
The tie-releaky.

1559
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:38,740
It's usually when they have also like a

1560
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:40,740
school girl uniform with the skirt

1561
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:42,740
and then, yeah, absolute territory.

1562
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,740
So you have the area between

1563
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:46,740
the ties, like the naked ties,

1564
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,740
the tie-high and the skirt.

1565
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:50,740
And there's also like

1566
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:52,740
the tie-pudge.

1567
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,740
The tie-releaky.

1568
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:56,740
Absolute territory.

1569
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,740
Oh, absolute...

1570
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,740
Absolutely territory?

1571
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:02,740
What is... Why is it called that?

1572
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:04,740
The absolute territory.

1573
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,740
Absolute territory.

1574
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:10,740
Absolute territory.

1575
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:12,740
It's like...

1576
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:14,740
I switched to no, I don't remember what I was using.

1577
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:16,740
It's so over for me.

1578
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:18,740
What color do you want your sweater to be?

1579
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:28,740
I don't know.

1580
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:30,740
I don't know. I like pink.

1581
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,740
You like pink? Pink is good.

1582
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:34,740
Pink is a good color, you're right.

1583
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,740
I'll make it pink.

1584
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,740
Giving me the absolute territory.

1585
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,740
Give me the absolute territory?

1586
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:54,740
And I will make it...

1587
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,740
I don't know.

1588
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,740
You made me slow today.

1589
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,740
Where is my... What size is this?

1590
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,740
Is this even the same brush?

1591
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:10,740
Well, I'm using this one now I guess.

1592
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,740
You made me look like a cute little...

1593
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:24,740
a cute little femme-boy there.

1594
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,740
No!

1595
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:28,740
It's cute!

1596
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:30,740
I don't want you to look like

1597
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,740
a cute femme-boy.

1598
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,740
It's probably because I don't have hair yet.

1599
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:36,740
You just got to add the hair buns.

1600
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,740
That's all.

1601
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:40,740
I got distracted.

1602
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,740
I'm working slowly.

1603
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,740
I don't want you to be a femme-boy.

1604
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:48,740
You have something against femme-boys?

1605
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,740
No.

1606
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:52,740
Clearly I love them.

1607
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:54,740
Clearly?

1608
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:56,740
Clearly, yeah.

1609
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:58,740
That's why I drew you like a femme-boy because I love them.

1610
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,740
Okay, okay.

1611
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,740
Whatever is underneath

1612
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:06,740
Amy's Band-Aid is my idea of

1613
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,740
absolute territory.

1614
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:10,740
Under my Band-Aid

1615
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,740
like on my nose?

1616
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:14,740
I removed my nose Band-Aid

1617
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,740
once because I was...

1618
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,740
I'm working on adding stuff to my model.

1619
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:20,740
And I just look really naked

1620
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:22,740
and I also just look like Voldemort.

1621
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:24,740
I look like I have no nose if I remove the Band-Aid.

1622
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:26,740
No!

1623
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,740
I also add

1624
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:30,740
a certain appeal because

1625
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:32,740
it's like the armpit thing.

1626
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:34,740
You don't normally see your nose.

1627
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:36,740
What if I see it?

1628
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:38,740
Suddenly even your nose is scandalous because

1629
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:40,740
we never get to see it.

1630
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:42,740
But we see your nose and it sucks.

1631
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,740
You see my nose and it's sexy

1632
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,740
because you never get to see it.

1633
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,740
Yeah, so it feels

1634
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,740
infinite when you finally get to see it.

1635
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:52,740
It's like seeing

1636
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,740
a girl without makeup for the first time.

1637
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:56,740
Mmm...

1638
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,740
It's intimate.

1639
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:00,740
Yeah!

1640
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,740
Oops, crap.

1641
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:04,740
Um...

1642
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:06,740
Oh...

1643
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:08,740
Okay.

1644
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:10,740
Suddenly even the nose is like

1645
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:12,740
oh my god, I'm so blessed to see her nose.

1646
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:16,740
I'll show you my nose one day.

1647
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:20,740
Well, I feel like

1648
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:22,740
that might be too intimate, too soon.

1649
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:24,740
Too soon?

1650
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:26,740
We'll work up to it slowly then.

1651
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:32,740
Don't get... don't be nervous, it's okay.

1652
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:34,740
I didn't know you were...

1653
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:36,740
I didn't know you were that type of girl.

1654
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:38,740
To show my nose so quickly?

1655
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:42,740
Yeah...

1656
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:44,740
Oh...

1657
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:46,740
I'm sorry. I won't show you my nose then.

1658
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:48,740
If you don't want to see my disgusting nose,

1659
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:50,740
I won't show it to you.

1660
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:52,740
I don't think you should

1661
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:54,740
ever do a nose reveal.

1662
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:56,740
No?

1663
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:58,740
No, because it's too intimate.

1664
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:00,740
What if we see your nose?

1665
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:02,740
Well, that's the point of a nose reveal.

1666
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:06,740
No, don't reveal it.

1667
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:08,740
Don't reveal it? Keep it a secret?

1668
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:10,740
Yeah.

1669
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,740
What if we...

1670
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,740
Only spots show their nose.

1671
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:16,740
You're not a spot, are you?

1672
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,740
No, no, no.

1673
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:20,740
If you reveal it for marriage,

1674
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,740
I'll save the nose reveal for marriage.

1675
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,740
Yeah, after...

1676
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,740
Once you get married on your honeymoon,

1677
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,740
you can be like...

1678
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:30,740
Yeah, we're married now.

1679
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:32,740
You can peel off the bandage, baby.

1680
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:34,740
You peel it off and you have the most ugly nose.

1681
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:36,740
I was gonna say...

1682
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:38,740
I peel it off and my nose just falls off

1683
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:40,740
because the bandage is what was holding my nose off.

1684
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:42,740
No!

1685
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:44,740
It's disgusting!

1686
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:46,740
Have you seen that woman

1687
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:48,740
she used to use like the salve or something

1688
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:50,740
on her nose like the black salve

1689
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:52,740
and her nose literally like wrought at it off

1690
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:54,740
like is that too gruesome? I think that might be too gruesome.

1691
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:56,740
She used what?

1692
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,740
She used like...

1693
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:00,740
There's this stuff called like black salve

1694
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:02,740
and people use it as like alternative cancer

1695
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:04,740
therapy for like skin cancer

1696
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:06,740
because they have to get like

1697
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:08,740
kills of the cancer cells

1698
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,740
so they like put it on and then like wroughts their skin

1699
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:12,740
and she did it on like a mole on her nose

1700
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,740
and then her nose fell off.

1701
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:16,740
Oh my god.

1702
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:18,740
That sounds like something I would do.

1703
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:20,740
I've looked up like

1704
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,740
those like mole removal creams

1705
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:24,740
and I was like

1706
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:26,740
oh I want to use those so badly.

1707
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:30,740
You know?

1708
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,740
Why?

1709
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:34,740
Because I have a lot of moles and I don't like them all

1710
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:36,740
so I want to get rid of them.

1711
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:38,740
Wait, I thought you said nose for some reason.

1712
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:40,740
I didn't realize that you said mole.

1713
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:42,740
So I was like what the fuck?

1714
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:44,740
A nose removal cream?

1715
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:46,740
Yeah, I was like

1716
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:48,740
what the fuck?

1717
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:50,740
No, mole removal

1718
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,740
not nose removal.

1719
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:54,740
Oh, like

1720
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:56,740
ugly moles are nice moles.

1721
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,740
What's the difference?

1722
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:00,740
Well, there's like

1723
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,740
ugly moles that like bulge out

1724
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:04,740
and they have like a little hair.

1725
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,740
Do you have those?

1726
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:08,740
No, I don't have bulging out moles.

1727
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:10,740
Oh, that's awesome though.

1728
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:12,740
Not really.

1729
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,740
But I have seen

1730
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:16,740
I used to have a piano teacher that had a lot of the bulging out moles

1731
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:18,740
and they would bulge out

1732
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:20,740
so much

1733
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,740
that they would have so little like

1734
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:24,740
skin connecting the mole

1735
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:26,740
to the you know to her body

1736
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:28,740
and sometimes I just wanted to grab her

1737
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:30,740
like bulging out moles and rip them off

1738
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:32,740
because it's like they look like

1739
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:34,740
they're about to fall off by themselves anyways.

1740
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:36,740
I really want to just rip them off.

1741
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:38,740
Like that's what I would do if I was her.

1742
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:40,740
No, I get it.

1743
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:42,740
But I'm also

1744
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,740
disgusting but also I get it because

1745
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:46,740
like I feel the same way but that yeah

1746
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:48,740
that's what I mean by like gross mole.

1747
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:50,740
I guess those are like skin tags basically.

1748
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:52,740
Yeah, like skin tags.

1749
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:54,740
Yeah.

1750
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,740
Why did you put the blood

1751
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:58,740
the blood toggle on your model?

1752
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:00,740
Because I thought it was appropriate.

1753
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:02,740
It is appropriate.

1754
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:04,740
No, if I had those like

1755
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:06,740
I don't know how people who have those

1756
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:08,740
have those because like

1757
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:10,740
that would be just coming off

1758
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,740
like that is not...

1759
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:14,740
I'm ripping that off of myself.

1760
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:16,740
Yeah, if it was me I would be ripping it off too

1761
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:18,740
like I would be simping it off with some scissors.

1762
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:20,740
I'm guessing it's probably

1763
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:22,740
painful for them to do that.

1764
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:24,740
Yeah, I guess it must be painful but

1765
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:26,740
like I don't think I could resist

1766
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:28,740
like even like appearance

1767
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:30,740
aside I just

1768
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:32,740
I can't resist picking it.

1769
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:34,740
I would see it as like a joy to remove it.

1770
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:36,740
Like a treat.

1771
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:38,740
Yeah, it's like a love treat.

1772
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:40,740
Yeah.

1773
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:44,740
You should be careful

1774
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:46,740
damaging moles they can turn to melanomas

1775
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:48,740
if they get injured too much.

1776
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:50,740
Wait, do they grow back?

1777
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:52,740
I think they do grow back

1778
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:54,740
if you like

1779
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:56,740
try to do it yourself.

1780
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:58,740
What the fuck? Are you serious?

1781
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:00,740
Yeah.

1782
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:02,740
I can never get rid of the moles.

1783
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:06,740
You can go to a doctor

1784
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:08,740
I think it's pretty cheap to get them like properly removed.

1785
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:10,740
Yeah, but if they grow back again

1786
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,740
what's the point?

1787
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:14,740
No, like they actually remove

1788
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:16,740
because I think they like remove the roots or something

1789
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,740
they don't usually come back

1790
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,740
if you get them like surgically removed

1791
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:22,740
but if you do them yourself

1792
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:24,740
like you don't go that deep I think.

1793
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:26,740
Oh, I'll go deep myself.

1794
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:30,740
I'll go deep myself.

1795
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:32,740
I'll get it myself.

1796
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:34,740
I can't even heal.

1797
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:38,740
Don't hit me.

1798
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:40,740
I can do it.

1799
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:42,740
I got it.

1800
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:44,740
Don't worry guys, I'll do it.

1801
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:46,740
I'll do it before and after.

1802
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:48,740
I'll do it mole removal stream.

1803
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,740
Come on, I believe in you.

1804
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:54,740
Thank you.

1805
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:56,740
I believe in your abilities.

1806
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:00,740
I'm gonna come back

1807
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:02,740
when I get bloody in the mole removal stream.

1808
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:06,740
I can't breathe.

1809
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:08,740
Don't do this at home kids.

1810
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:10,740
Don't do this.

1811
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:14,740
I was thinking like

1812
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,740
I'm surprised nobody's done like

1813
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:18,740
I mean maybe somebody's done it

1814
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:20,740
but like hair cutting streams aren't common.

1815
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:22,740
True.

1816
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,740
Like why doesn't anyone do like hair cutting streams?

1817
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,740
If I was a flesh tuber I would

1818
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:28,740
when I was a flesh tuber I wanted to do a stream

1819
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:30,740
where I shaved my eyebrows off.

1820
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:32,740
I thought that would be really fun.

1821
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:34,740
That sounds like good content.

1822
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:36,740
If you're somebody who's like

1823
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,740
cutting your hair frequently anyway

1824
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:40,740
you might as well make a stream of it.

1825
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,740
Yeah, I cut my own hair yeah

1826
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:44,740
and I used to shave my eyebrows off too

1827
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:46,740
so it would be fun.

1828
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:50,740
Did you like draw them back on?

1829
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:52,740
Yeah, I did.

1830
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:54,740
I would draw them in fun colors

1831
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:56,740
like pink and purple.

1832
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:58,740
It's a pretty type of thing.

1833
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:06,740
I shaved my eyebrows once

1834
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:08,740
and I regretted it because

1835
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:10,740
it's really annoying. It's really hard to draw them back on.

1836
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:12,740
But then I grew back.

1837
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:14,740
It can be hard.

1838
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:16,740
It can be hard to draw them back on yeah.

1839
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:20,740
But I have really, I have like really small eyebrows

1840
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:22,740
so it's like

1841
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,740
not much work.

1842
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,740
Mine are big.

1843
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:28,740
I like big brows.

1844
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:30,740
I wish I had bigger brows.

1845
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:32,740
Mine are really small and hard to see sometimes.

1846
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:34,740
It's really not that much of a difference

1847
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:36,740
whether I

1848
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:38,740
shave them off or not

1849
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,740
because most of the time they're hard to see anyways.

1850
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:44,740
I have a lot of hair

1851
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,740
and everything so

1852
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:50,740
I need to get the right color

1853
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:52,740
of hair for me.

1854
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:54,740
Like

1855
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:56,740
strawberry blonde?

1856
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:58,740
I'm supposed to be ginger.

1857
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:04,740
I thought you were like

1858
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,740
strawberry blonde.

1859
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:08,740
Everyone does.

1860
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:10,740
Everyone thinks I'm blonde.

1861
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:12,740
I thought I was blonde too

1862
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:14,740
but no, I'm supposed to be ginger.

1863
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:18,740
Same thing?

1864
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:20,740
Like this is close as a color

1865
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:22,740
at least this is like the shading color.

1866
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:24,740
This is like the darker color.

1867
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:26,740
This is kind of the lighter

1868
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:28,740
you think?

1869
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:30,740
Yeah, like this.

1870
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:32,740
Yeah, I look very blonde.

1871
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:38,740
Getting the colors hard.

1872
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,740
Can I make

1873
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:42,740
groups like folders

1874
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:44,740
with this?

1875
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:52,740
Alright, that's okay.

1876
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:54,740
I'm not big of a deal.

1877
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:56,740
I'm just gonna merge them.

1878
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:58,740
I'm not doing everything

1879
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:00,740
unless you link one there.

1880
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:08,740
So you admit you're ginger?

1881
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,740
Well, if I'm supposed to be ginger

1882
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:12,740
I'm fucking ginger.

1883
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:14,740
Whatever.

1884
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,740
I'm just annoyed that I don't look ginger, you know?

1885
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:18,740
Like if I'm gonna be ginger.

1886
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:20,740
I mean, I don't think it'd be

1887
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:22,740
harder to make.

1888
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:24,740
You could just like up the saturation.

1889
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:26,740
Yeah, I really thought

1890
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,740
strawberry blonde is really cute though.

1891
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:30,740
I don't see many strawberry blonde

1892
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:32,740
YouTubers.

1893
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:34,740
I see ginger.

1894
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:36,740
I don't see many strawberry blondes.

1895
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:38,740
I don't see many ginger YouTubers.

1896
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:40,740
I guess not, yeah.

1897
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:42,740
I see blondes a lot though

1898
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:44,740
for sure.

1899
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:46,740
But not many ginger.

1900
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:48,740
Which is fair, because

1901
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:50,740
ginger has no soul.

1902
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:52,740
So why would you want to be ginger?

1903
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:54,740
What the heck?

1904
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,740
You're not gonna eat ginger, bro.

1905
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:58,740
I know.

1906
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:00,740
I'm built.

1907
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:02,740
Where did your soul go?

1908
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:04,740
That the more, that the reason for the more?

1909
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:06,740
You're ginger with no soul,

1910
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:08,740
so you do.

1911
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:10,740
I do witchcraft.

1912
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,740
I'm a Satanist

1913
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:14,740
because I'm a ginger with no soul.

1914
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:16,740
Yeah, that is the lure.

1915
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:18,740
Holy fucking shit.

1916
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:20,740
Lore drop, lore drop.

1917
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:22,740
Lore drop?

1918
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:26,740
I'm trying to do

1919
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:28,740
some line art now, but

1920
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:30,740
it's gone.

1921
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:32,740
It's gone.

1922
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:34,740
I'm just gonna consider that my

1923
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:36,740
line art and doing

1924
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:38,740
what I can with it.

1925
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:40,740
Do what you can.

1926
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:42,740
We'll work better in our

1927
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:44,740
own drawing programs.

1928
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:46,740
Yeah, yeah.

1929
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:48,740
I think it looks pretty cute.

1930
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:50,740
Lore's looks pretty cute.

1931
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:52,740
Yours looks adorable.

1932
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:56,740
I'm just struggling through it.

1933
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:58,740
It's okay.

1934
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:00,740
I'll add more ginger in this.

1935
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:02,740
I think for the flat, I'll just see the main.

1936
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:04,740
Blonde.

1937
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:06,740
I'll add the ginger with the shading.

1938
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:08,740
The ginger comes later.

1939
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:12,740
Okay.

1940
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:16,740
It'll make sense now.

1941
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:18,740
Then put cooking on that lure.

1942
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:20,740
She's building on my lure for me.

1943
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:22,740
Wait, I thought that was

1944
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:24,740
literally your lure.

1945
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:26,740
Did I just make it up?

1946
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:28,740
Well, it is my lure, but

1947
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:30,740
the ginger I didn't think

1948
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:32,740
had anything

1949
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:34,740
to do with it.

1950
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,740
You just linked.

1951
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:38,740
I just made up your lure by accident

1952
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:40,740
that I thought was already your lure.

1953
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:42,740
No, at least I don't think the ginger

1954
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:44,740
has anything to do with it.

1955
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:46,740
Maybe it did. Maybe they were like,

1956
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:48,740
let's make her ginger if she's gonna

1957
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:50,740
be a satanist. She's gotta be ginger

1958
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:52,740
because they have no souls.

1959
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:54,740
Yeah, exactly.

1960
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:56,740
They were thinking about it.

1961
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:58,740
Maybe, I don't know.

1962
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:00,740
They're racist against genders.

1963
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:02,740
Are you allowed to say that word on YouTube?

1964
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:04,740
Racist?

1965
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:06,740
Yeah. Of course you can say racist.

1966
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:10,740
No one's here.

1967
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:12,740
No one's here to stop you.

1968
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:18,740
Am I going crazy internally

1969
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:20,740
because her lines

1970
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:22,740
aren't perfect enough for her? Yes.

1971
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:24,740
This drawing program

1972
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:26,740
sucks balls.

1973
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:28,740
So, of course...

1974
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:30,740
Drawing just casual...

1975
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:32,740
Yeah, it's meant for fun drawings

1976
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:34,740
with friends, so it's okay.

1977
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:36,740
Don't use it seriously though.

1978
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:38,740
It's also annoying.

1979
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:40,740
It's also annoying.

1980
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:42,740
They implemented

1981
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:44,740
so many silly things that no one would ever want

1982
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:46,740
but there's basic stuff that

1983
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:48,740
you just can't do in it.

1984
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:50,740
Wait, what did they implement?

1985
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:52,740
They added AI to this,

1986
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:54,740
which I don't even understand.

1987
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:56,740
Why would you need AI for a group drawing program?

1988
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,740
What are you gonna do?

1989
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:00,740
They added AI?

1990
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:02,740
Yeah.

1991
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:04,740
I think it's for...

1992
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,740
I don't know, I think just like generating concepts.

1993
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:08,740
But then...

1994
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:10,740
there isn't even like a blend tool.

1995
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:12,740
I don't know.

1996
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:14,740
There isn't a blend tool?

1997
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:16,740
But they add AI?

1998
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:18,740
They make the AI blend it for you?

1999
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:22,740
I don't really understand.

2000
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:24,740
And then there's like a weird chat

2001
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:26,740
and there's voice calling in this.

2002
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:28,740
True.

2003
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:30,740
There's a chat and voice calling.

2004
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:32,740
Who the fuck is using voice call

2005
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:34,740
in the magma?

2006
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,740
If you're drawing with a friend,

2007
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,740
you're probably already in a voice call.

2008
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:42,740
Yeah, like why would you...

2009
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:44,740
and I assume the voice call in here,

2010
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:46,740
maybe it is like really good.

2011
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:48,740
But why? What is the purpose?

2012
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:50,740
Just give me a blend tool.

2013
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:52,740
Just give me a blend tool.

2014
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:00,740
John Vealer confirmed this lore

2015
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:02,740
in the Vealer lore podcast.

2016
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:04,740
Who the fuck is John Vealer?

2017
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:06,740
What are you talking about?

2018
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:08,740
Magma more like smegma?

2019
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:10,740
No, not smegma.

2020
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:14,740
Magma more like smegma.

2021
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:16,740
Do you like smegma?

2022
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:18,740
Do you like smegma?

2023
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:22,740
I like smells.

2024
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:24,740
You like smegma?

2025
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,740
No, smells.

2026
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:28,740
Not smegma.

2027
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,740
When you say that you like smells,

2028
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:32,740
that makes it sound like you like the smell of smegma.

2029
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:36,740
I don't know what it smells like. Maybe I do.

2030
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:40,740
I don't know what it smells like either.

2031
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:42,740
Have you seen what smegma looks like?

2032
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:44,740
Yeah, you can...

2033
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:46,740
Look it up?

2034
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:48,740
There's subreddit dedicated to it.

2035
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:50,740
Because people are into it.

2036
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:54,740
There's subreddit dedicated to smegma?

2037
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:56,740
Yeah.

2038
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:58,740
Like smegma lovers.

2039
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,740
r slash smegma lovers.

2040
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:02,740
Don't look it up. That's a real subreddit.

2041
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:04,740
No fucking way.

2042
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:06,740
There's an r slash smegma lovers?

2043
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:08,740
Don't look it. It's disgusting.

2044
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:10,740
I'm looking up r slash smegma lovers.

2045
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:12,740
No, don't.

2046
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:14,740
It's actually fucking disgusting.

2047
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:16,740
Don't.

2048
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:18,740
I want to see it.

2049
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,740
I want to see it really badly.

2050
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:22,740
I've never...

2051
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:24,740
I clicked on one out of curiosity before

2052
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:26,740
and I nearly threw up.

2053
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:28,740
You can't throw up.

2054
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:32,740
It's disgusting.

2055
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:34,740
I looked at it again myself.

2056
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:38,740
Wait, I don't even see anything.

2057
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:40,740
What am I looking at?

2058
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:42,740
It's just...

2059
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:44,740
I don't see it.

2060
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:50,740
Wait.

2061
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:54,740
No, I think we must look like the same image.

2062
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:56,740
I think we saw the same one.

2063
01:26:56,740 --> 01:26:58,740
I think we saw the same one.

2064
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:00,740
I think we saw...

2065
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:10,740
I kind of want to see more.

2066
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:14,740
Okay, I'll stop.

2067
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:18,740
Oh god.

2068
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:22,740
I told you.

2069
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:24,740
I wasn't exaggerating.

2070
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:28,740
I wasn't...

2071
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:30,740
I told you, don't lie.

2072
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:32,740
And you know what?

2073
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:34,740
It's not as bad as I expected it to be,

2074
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:36,740
but it's still really gross.

2075
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:38,740
You nearly threw up.

2076
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:40,740
I don't even know it's not as bad as you expected.

2077
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:42,740
Some of them are even worse.

2078
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:44,740
Those are like...

2079
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:46,740
Send me your worst one.

2080
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:48,740
We can look at the top post together.

2081
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:50,740
The top post of all time?

2082
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,740
Yeah, from that subject.

2083
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:54,740
I'll do it. I'll stream it to you.

2084
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:56,740
I'll open it and stream it to you.

2085
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:58,740
You'll open it and stream it together.

2086
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,740
This is what the stream is.

2087
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:02,740
I'm going to share my stream.

2088
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:04,740
Ignore my million tabs.

2089
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:06,740
Don't share this. I'm so scared.

2090
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:08,740
I'm not sharing it, don't worry.

2091
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:10,740
Wait, I just realized I'm still streaming to you anyway.

2092
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:12,740
Is that the fuck?

2093
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:14,740
Oh god.

2094
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:16,740
The fucking tab is titled

2095
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:18,740
Ripe smelly cheese forest.

2096
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:20,740
For skin.

2097
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:22,740
Ripe smelly cheesy for skin.

2098
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:24,740
Okay.

2099
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,740
Top all time.

2100
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:28,740
Okay, all time.

2101
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:30,740
Smells amazing.

2102
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:32,740
16 hours ago.

2103
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:34,740
This is fun today.

2104
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:36,740
Smells amazing.

2105
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:38,740
Do you want to look at this one 16 hours ago?

2106
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:40,740
Sure.

2107
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:42,740
Okay.

2108
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:44,740
It's not that bad.

2109
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:46,740
Go all time.

2110
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:48,740
I need to see the thickest,

2111
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:50,740
most disgusting,

2112
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:52,740
chunkiest one, you know?

2113
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:54,740
Why bother cleaning it

2114
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:56,740
when it just keeps coming back?

2115
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:58,740
Am I right?

2116
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:00,740
This has 901 of votes.

2117
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:02,740
I'm actually scared.

2118
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:04,740
Open it.

2119
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:06,740
What?

2120
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:08,740
I don't see it.

2121
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:10,740
Oh my god.

2122
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:12,740
Oh my god.

2123
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:14,740
Oh my god.

2124
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:16,740
Holy shit.

2125
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:18,740
Whoa.

2126
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:20,740
Oh my god.

2127
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:22,740
Wait.

2128
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:28,740
That's what I was expecting.

2129
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:30,740
I was expecting that for like every

2130
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,740
every single post.

2131
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,740
I was expecting that for every

2132
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:42,740
every single post.

2133
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:44,740
That's like really intense.

2134
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:46,740
Yeah.

2135
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,740
I was expecting that for every single post.

2136
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:50,740
That's like really intense.

2137
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:52,740
Yeah.

2138
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:54,740
Oh my god.

2139
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:56,740
Are you okay?

2140
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:58,740
Oh god.

2141
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:00,740
No idea.

2142
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:02,740
My eyes are so watery.

2143
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:04,740
Holy shit.

2144
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:06,740
Thank you for introducing me

2145
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,740
to Slash's Make My Lovers.

2146
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:10,740
You're welcome.

2147
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:12,740
I would have never had that

2148
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,740
in my life if it weren't for you.

2149
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:16,740
I would have gone

2150
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,740
my entire life without

2151
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:20,740
seeing that.

2152
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:22,740
I don't even,

2153
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:24,740
I get curious and I go down like

2154
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:26,740
rabbit holes sometimes, but that one was too far.

2155
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:28,740
Like I literally, like I can't.

2156
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:30,740
I thought I had like a strong stomach,

2157
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:32,740
but I literally just the visual

2158
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:34,740
is enough to get me going.

2159
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:36,740
Yeah.

2160
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:38,740
Like I, the video,

2161
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:40,740
the video is even worse than just the photo.

2162
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:42,740
It is, because you see it like

2163
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:44,740
popping out.

2164
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:46,740
Don't describe it.

2165
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:48,740
Don't even like, I can't,

2166
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:50,740
even like the description.

2167
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:52,740
Ugh.

2168
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:54,740
You don't want to think about it

2169
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:56,740
popping out of the top.

2170
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:58,740
Good.

2171
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:00,740
I don't want to, no.

2172
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:02,740
What do you mean there's worse videos

2173
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:04,740
if you are interested?

2174
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:06,740
I'm absolutely not interested.

2175
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:08,740
I couldn't even finish that one.

2176
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:10,740
I have a little bit of

2177
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:12,740
morbid curiosity,

2178
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:14,740
so I kind of want to see, but also

2179
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:16,740
please don't, please don't send me.

2180
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:18,740
Please don't send me videos

2181
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:20,740
of your, of your smegma

2182
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:22,740
dick.

2183
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:24,740
I'm good.

2184
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:26,740
You're going to end up with videos of them.

2185
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:28,740
No.

2186
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:30,740
Yes, the smegma pops out.

2187
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:32,740
That is what she's describing.

2188
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:34,740
She's disgusting.

2189
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:36,740
If it's a niche and some smegas,

2190
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:38,740
some smegma's fine, right? No!

2191
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:40,740
No.

2192
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:42,740
Not just some.

2193
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:44,740
I think like a little bit, but this is not a little bit.

2194
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:46,740
No.

2195
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:48,740
Not even some is fine.

2196
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:50,740
Please don't have any smegma.

2197
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:52,740
Thank you.

2198
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:54,740
Is it too much to ask?

2199
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:56,740
True.

2200
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:58,740
True.

2201
01:31:58,740 --> 01:32:00,740
I don't even, that video had

2202
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:02,740
901 uploads.

2203
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:04,740
Not only did not, like

2204
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,740
at least 901 people,

2205
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:08,740
well more than 901 people

2206
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:10,740
have seen it, but 901

2207
01:32:10,740 --> 01:32:12,740
people saw that and liked it.

2208
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:14,740
I liked it.

2209
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:16,740
I feel like it was all guys too.

2210
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:18,740
I feel like it's all just guys liking each other's smegma.

2211
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:20,740
It definitely has to be.

2212
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:22,740
Yeah.

2213
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:24,740
But it's still like, even like 901 people,

2214
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:26,740
901 people saw them like, yeah.

2215
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:28,740
And went, yeah, that's hot.

2216
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:30,740
That's hot.

2217
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:32,740
And I couldn't even like finish the video,

2218
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:34,740
like that's one of the worst things.

2219
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:36,740
I think I would rather watch somebody like eat a pile of shit.

2220
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:38,740
Like,

2221
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:40,740
there are a few things I can think of

2222
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:42,740
that are worse than that.

2223
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:44,740
I don't know what it, it's just fucking disgusting.

2224
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:46,740
There was a wife involved

2225
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:48,740
in like the fourth

2226
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:50,740
of all time post.

2227
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:52,740
Yeah, oh yeah, he mentions, like, yeah,

2228
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:54,740
I saw he like mentions his wife, like

2229
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:56,740
helps keep it clean.

2230
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:58,740
I assume it's like a video of his wife

2231
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,740
literally like taking the smegma.

2232
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:02,740
Ew!

2233
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:04,740
I didn't, I didn't look at it.

2234
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:06,740
Did you look at it?

2235
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:08,740
No, I don't want to see it.

2236
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:10,740
I feel like that's even more gross to watch someone eat it.

2237
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:12,740
Like,

2238
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:14,740
that's worse.

2239
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:16,740
That's worse than what we've already seen,

2240
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:18,740
to watch someone eat it.

2241
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:20,740
That's weird.

2242
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:22,740
You

2243
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:24,740
assume it's guys looking at that subreddit

2244
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:26,740
when it's literally DEMPA telling us about it?

2245
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:28,740
DEMPA, how do you know about that?

2246
01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:30,740
I don't even remember.

2247
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:32,740
I just, I browse reddit

2248
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:34,740
and I find things on reddit.

2249
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:36,740
I've looked a lot at, like, um,

2250
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:38,740
there's like,

2251
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:40,740
a museum of reddit filth.

2252
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:42,740
I'm just in general like close to that archive,

2253
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:44,740
like cursed reddit content.

2254
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:46,740
So I think I found it when I was searching for like

2255
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:48,740
cursed reddit content

2256
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:50,740
that was like linked in like,

2257
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:52,740
cursed subreddit.

2258
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:54,740
So I was like, what is this?

2259
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:56,740
What's the worst thing you've seen on reddit?

2260
01:33:56,740 --> 01:33:58,740
Uh,

2261
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:00,740
have you seen the poop in the condoms?

2262
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:02,740
What?

2263
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,740
The poop condoms.

2264
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:06,740
The,

2265
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:08,740
the what?

2266
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:10,740
Reddit, reddit,

2267
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:12,740
poop condoms.

2268
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:14,740
Let me try to find it.

2269
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:16,740
That condom.

2270
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:18,740
Scat?

2271
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:20,740
Yeah, it was in,

2272
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:22,740
wait, I think it's in like the museum of reddit filth.

2273
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:24,740
I can't find it.

2274
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:26,740
I don't know, maybe someone in chat, but there's

2275
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:28,740
like, it's like an old post of a guy

2276
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:30,740
who like, stores his own poop

2277
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:32,740
in condoms. Oh wait, yeah.

2278
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:34,740
He like, stored his own poop in condoms

2279
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:36,740
and to like, keep?

2280
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:38,740
Yeah.

2281
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:40,740
I've heard of the guy who stored his own poop in jars

2282
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:42,740
and then his wife found out about it.

2283
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:44,740
No.

2284
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:46,740
But in condoms?

2285
01:34:46,740 --> 01:34:48,740
Oh, you guys do know.

2286
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:50,740
Yeah, they know.

2287
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:52,740
What's it called? Is it a subreddit or is it just one guy?

2288
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:54,740
It's just one guy.

2289
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:56,740
But I don't know where,

2290
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:58,740
I don't know how to find it.

2291
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:00,740
And I found like, I tried to find it

2292
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:02,740
and I found a guy

2293
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:04,740
eating poop condoms.

2294
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:06,740
I found?

2295
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:08,740
Oh, what the fuck.

2296
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:10,740
I found a post from four years ago

2297
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:12,740
that says, will I get sick if I continue

2298
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:14,740
to inhale a decoration I made from my restroom?

2299
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:16,740
A scat condom?

2300
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:18,740
The whole place smells like poop but it looks cool

2301
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:20,740
and then it's just a video of him like,

2302
01:35:20,740 --> 01:35:22,740
flicking it around

2303
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:26,740
and like, holding it and like, squishing it.

2304
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:28,740
Ooh, ooh, oh wow.

2305
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:32,740
Oh, he's like milking it like,

2306
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:34,740
milking it like a cow udder.

2307
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:38,740
And like, punching it.

2308
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:40,740
I feel like that's not it.

2309
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:42,740
But it's the less gross version

2310
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:44,740
but it's still pretty nasty.

2311
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:46,740
Basically, the poop condom

2312
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:48,740
is like a whole genre.

2313
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:50,740
It's like a whole,

2314
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:52,740
it's a whole thing because like I said,

2315
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:54,740
I was trying to find it.

2316
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:56,740
Maybe? So I was trying to find it

2317
01:35:56,740 --> 01:35:58,740
and like I said, I couldn't find the exact one

2318
01:35:58,740 --> 01:36:00,740
because there's so much that shows up

2319
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:02,740
when you try to find poop condoms.

2320
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:04,740
So much shows up.

2321
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:06,740
Sorry, can you repeat that?

2322
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:08,740
So much shows up when you search

2323
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:10,740
for like poop condoms.

2324
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:12,740
Oh, so you can't find the original?

2325
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:14,740
Yeah, there's so many.

2326
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:16,740
There's too much poop condom content.

2327
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:22,740
I read it post too much poop condom.

2328
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:26,740
It's called the Alaskan Pipeline.

2329
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:28,740
Oh, yeah, the Alaskan Pipeline!

2330
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:30,740
What?

2331
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:32,740
I think that is what I've heard it called,

2332
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:34,740
the Alaskan Pipeline.

2333
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:36,740
The Alaskan Pipeline.

2334
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:40,740
So should I search up Alaskan Pipeline?

2335
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:44,740
I guess. Wait, let me look at the Alaskan Pipeline.

2336
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:46,740
No, it's called the Alaskan...

2337
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:48,740
Wait, no!

2338
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:50,740
No, no, wait, no, wait.

2339
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:52,740
No.

2340
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:54,740
Oh, wait, no, yes!

2341
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:56,740
The act of pooping into a condom,

2342
01:36:56,740 --> 01:36:58,740
freezing the rubber overnight

2343
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:00,740
and then inserting it into one's anus,

2344
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:02,740
that is called the Alaskan Pipeline.

2345
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:10,740
What the fuck?

2346
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:14,740
Yeah, so you'll find like a lot of people.

2347
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:16,740
Yeah, this is like a thing.

2348
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:18,740
Wait, you'll find people?

2349
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:20,740
Is there like videos of people doing that?

2350
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:24,740
Yes, they post them on the internet.

2351
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:26,740
Should I look it up?

2352
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:28,740
No, you shouldn't.

2353
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:30,740
I shouldn't.

2354
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:32,740
Well, if you're into that I guess,

2355
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:34,740
if you're like interested.

2356
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:38,740
I don't think it'll do you good.

2357
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:46,740
Like I don't think it'll help.

2358
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:50,740
I just see the transit Alaskan Pipeline.

2359
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:54,740
I guess it's not, it must not be popular,

2360
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:56,740
but I found a post saying help,

2361
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:58,740
it's a Facebook post and it says,

2362
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:00,740
help, my boyfriend was out of town

2363
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:02,740
and I was super horny.

2364
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:04,740
I didn't have any sex toys so long story short,

2365
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:06,740
I decided to try something new

2366
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:08,740
and I shot in a condom and froze it.

2367
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:10,740
Apparently it's called an Alaskan Pipeline.

2368
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:12,740
Anyway, midway through the big,

2369
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:14,740
oh, the condom broke, but I didn't stop.

2370
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:16,740
I just want to know if I can get an infection from it.

2371
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:18,740
I mean, it did come from my own body,

2372
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:20,740
so I think I'm fine.

2373
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:24,740
There's no way that's not as real.

2374
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:26,740
That was like someone's bait post.

2375
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:28,740
What year is this from?

2376
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:33,740
Um, it's a screenshot of a Facebook post from three years ago.

2377
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:37,740
And the Facebook post itself doesn't have a timestamp.

2378
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:40,740
I mean everything on Facebook is like definitely fake,

2379
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:42,740
but like also,

2380
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:46,740
yeah, I guess just the poop thing is like common.

2381
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:48,740
It's a common thing.

2382
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:54,740
It's really fucked up.

2383
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:56,740
There's a lot of people

2384
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:58,740
on Reddit asking,

2385
01:38:58,740 --> 01:39:00,740
like has anyone done this?

2386
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:04,740
Because they're like,

2387
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:06,740
no, because they're like,

2388
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:08,740
I want to do this. Do you guys have experience?

2389
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:10,740
Why though?

2390
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:12,740
Yeah, that's true.

2391
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:14,740
I don't want to use your own shit.

2392
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:16,740
It's got to be some sort of like,

2393
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:18,740
like you could literally use like a brush handle,

2394
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:22,740
a bottle, like fucking your fingers.

2395
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:24,740
You could.

2396
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:26,740
Like why?

2397
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:28,740
It's like that guy who got Salmonella

2398
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:32,740
from having eggs with a chicken breast?

2399
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:34,740
With a chicken breast?

2400
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:38,740
A chicken breast?

2401
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:42,740
I heard about the coconut guy.

2402
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:46,740
Like the Reddit coconut guy or like the Combox guy?

2403
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:50,740
Have you heard about the Reddit shoebox guy?

2404
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:52,740
I have heard about the Reddit shoebox guy.

2405
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:54,740
I think I even saw the picture of his shoebox too.

2406
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:56,740
Yeah, the Combox with the pictures.

2407
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:58,740
That one's kind of classic.

2408
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:00,740
That one wasn't really that gross.

2409
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:02,740
I think because it was like,

2410
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:04,740
maybe this gross.

2411
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:06,740
I can't even find like a picture because this was like,

2412
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:08,740
this was 12 years ago.

2413
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:10,740
It's an old thing for sure.

2414
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:12,740
It's, oh no, I didn't realize.

2415
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:14,740
Oops, I'm not old.

2416
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:16,740
I don't know. 12 years ago.

2417
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:18,740
I was still...

2418
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:23,740
You were still what?

2419
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:28,740
I was still on my planet, my home planet.

2420
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:30,740
Yeah, I was still young.

2421
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:34,740
It's still in my mother's womb 12 years ago.

2422
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:36,740
No, you can't say that on me.

2423
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:38,740
Wait, I'm switching again.

2424
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:40,740
I mean, I...

2425
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:42,740
Wait, I'm an adult.

2426
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:46,740
I am an adult.

2427
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:52,740
You're my favorite adult.

2428
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:54,740
Thank you.

2429
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:58,740
He cut the chicken breast and half and fricked it.

2430
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:00,740
Why would you do that?

2431
01:41:00,740 --> 01:41:02,740
He was cooking naked.

2432
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:05,740
Okay, that sounds like an excuse.

2433
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:08,740
That sounds like the excuse he would give Reddit to be like,

2434
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:11,740
did I fuck up chat?

2435
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:16,740
So I accidentally spilled soda on my pants while I was cooking,

2436
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:18,740
so I had to take my pants off.

2437
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:22,740
And then, you know, the chicken breast was just looking really,

2438
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:24,740
really irresistible.

2439
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:26,740
Yeah, I don't think...

2440
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:30,740
I don't think you just accidentally fucked the chicken breast.

2441
01:41:30,740 --> 01:41:34,740
It's a little bit hard to do that.

2442
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:36,740
And then suddenly next thing I know,

2443
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:40,740
I just slipped into it and I couldn't stop thrusting.

2444
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:50,740
I was washing potatoes in the bath and one slipped in my butt.

2445
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:52,740
No.

2446
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:56,740
I think I've actually seen, like, people, like, Reddit posts,

2447
01:41:56,740 --> 01:41:58,740
again, where people are like...

2448
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:01,740
I think, like, people going to the ER for things in their butt

2449
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:04,740
is pretty common because stuff gets, like, stuck.

2450
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:08,740
But I don't know about accidentally getting your penis stuck inside of the chicken.

2451
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:10,740
No, it's...

2452
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:13,740
The post isn't about getting your penis stuck inside of a chicken.

2453
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:20,740
It was about a guy who fucked the chicken and got a salmonella.

2454
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:24,740
Wait, you can get salmonella through your penis?

2455
01:42:24,740 --> 01:42:26,740
Can you? I guess, apparently.

2456
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:32,740
Well, how else did he get it if he didn't get it from his penis?

2457
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:36,740
Did he, like, eat the raw chicken after fucking it?

2458
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:38,740
Well, it's back...

2459
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:41,740
You get salmonella from fucking its chicken breast.

2460
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:43,740
It's bacteria, right? Salmonella is a...

2461
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:46,740
Is it a bacterial infection or is it a...

2462
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:49,740
What kind of infection is it? Is it a viral infection?

2463
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:51,740
I don't know.

2464
01:42:51,740 --> 01:42:54,740
How do you... Can you Google...

2465
01:42:54,740 --> 01:43:00,740
Hey Google, can you get salmonella from putting your penis inside of the raw chicken?

2466
01:43:00,740 --> 01:43:05,740
Hey Siri, can you get salmonella from putting your penis inside of a raw chicken?

2467
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:10,740
Cool. Can she actually answer this?

2468
01:43:10,740 --> 01:43:14,740
The member has a hole, too. It does have a hole, but it just...

2469
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:16,740
I don't know, you don't expect it to...

2470
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:22,740
Oh my god, you made me so freaking adorable with the striped socks, too.

2471
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:24,740
Holy shit!

2472
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:26,740
Your socks are powerful.

2473
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:29,740
I wish I could blend. My coloring looks so sloppin'.

2474
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:32,740
I know. I know, it's really hard to blend.

2475
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:37,740
I usually use watercolor brushes, except for more textures, so I feel like it...

2476
01:43:37,740 --> 01:43:40,740
I just... I don't know. I think it looks okay.

2477
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:43,740
It looks so good! Are you kidding me?

2478
01:43:43,740 --> 01:43:49,740
It's just not ideal coloring. I'm trying, though.

2479
01:43:49,740 --> 01:43:51,740
You made me adorable. Don't worry about it.

2480
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:55,740
I know this program is hard to use. You did amazing with what you had.

2481
01:43:58,740 --> 01:44:00,740
You did great.

2482
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:03,740
Yeah, the thigh high.

2483
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:08,740
Make me a ginger? Oh, right. It's okay. It's okay for now. It's fine.

2484
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:24,740
Read it. Read it. Read it.

2485
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:26,740
What if you were a Reddit alien?

2486
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:31,740
Actually, you're... No, no, I'm so sorry, but the things on the end of your twin tails,

2487
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:34,740
they kind of look like a Reddit alien if you look at it.

2488
01:44:35,740 --> 01:44:38,740
They do look like the Reddit character, you mean?

2489
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:40,740
Yes, no. I think our name is...

2490
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:48,740
No. It literally looks like the Reddit alien, but instead of two balls, it's three balls.

2491
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:52,740
Okay, let me look up what you're talking about.

2492
01:44:52,740 --> 01:44:56,740
Reddit alien next to your twin tail.

2493
01:44:56,740 --> 01:45:02,740
You literally have an upside down Reddit alien with three balls on your twin tails.

2494
01:45:04,740 --> 01:45:05,740
I do.

2495
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:09,740
How do I flip it? How the fuck do I flip things in this program?

2496
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:12,740
How do I fucking rotate it? Just rotate the whole...

2497
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:14,740
Wait, no. They can't see it if I rotate it.

2498
01:45:14,740 --> 01:45:16,740
I'll rotate myself.

2499
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:18,740
How do I make it upside down?

2500
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:21,740
Oh, there it is. Wait. No, I can't rotate it, so...

2501
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:24,740
I can't... Oh, there. There it is.

2502
01:45:24,740 --> 01:45:29,740
No, it's literally... Yeah, it actually does have three balls because it has the antenna, too.

2503
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:31,740
It's literally...

2504
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:33,740
It's literally identical.

2505
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:35,740
You just wrote to the alien.

2506
01:45:36,740 --> 01:45:38,740
Yeah, it's literally identical.

2507
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:40,740
It's literally the man.

2508
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:43,740
Wait, the Seabat Reddit story.

2509
01:45:43,740 --> 01:45:48,740
Isn't that just the story of the guy that freaks to Seabat?

2510
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:52,740
Yeah, he just had sex to the song.

2511
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:54,740
Oh, that's so tame.

2512
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:55,740
I like that song.

2513
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:56,740
I like that song.

2514
01:45:56,740 --> 01:45:58,740
That's a bad song.

2515
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:00,740
What? What do you mean I like it?

2516
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:02,740
I, ironically, like that song.

2517
01:46:02,740 --> 01:46:04,740
It's a bad song.

2518
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:08,740
At least it's a bad song. How is it a bad song?

2519
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:10,740
Like, it's like...

2520
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:13,740
It's got such a shitty tempo.

2521
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:16,740
What? No, that's what makes it awesome.

2522
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:19,740
It's like different. It's so good to work through.

2523
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:22,740
Like, I shit my ass to it. It's fucking awesome.

2524
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:24,740
Proof or it didn't happen.

2525
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:26,740
Proof or it didn't happen.

2526
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:28,740
I'm listening to it right now.

2527
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:32,740
I'll do a cover of it. I'll sing it and be obnoxious right now.

2528
01:46:32,740 --> 01:46:34,740
I'll sing on stream.

2529
01:46:34,740 --> 01:46:36,740
It doesn't have lyrics. What are you gonna sing?

2530
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:39,740
No, sing it. I'll sing the song.

2531
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:42,740
Wait, sing it. Sing it. I want you to sing it to me.

2532
01:46:42,740 --> 01:46:44,740
I'm gonna sing you the song and I want you to sing it.

2533
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:47,740
See that karaoke. See that karaoke.

2534
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:49,740
It doesn't have lyrics, though.

2535
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:51,740
It does.

2536
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:52,740
It does?

2537
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:54,740
It does.

2538
01:46:54,740 --> 01:46:55,740
What? I thought it was just...

2539
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:56,740
The lyrics are...

2540
01:46:56,740 --> 01:46:58,740
No, the lyrics go...

2541
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:04,740
I can type them out for you. I can write the lyrics for you if you need them.

2542
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:07,740
That's just instrumental.

2543
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:10,740
No, it's not. It's the lyrics.

2544
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:21,740
That's not horrible either, the magnetic beads.

2545
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:29,740
Did you hear about the guy that got 12 tiny horse miniatures stuck inside of his beanus?

2546
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:36,740
How does that fit? How many were the horses? How small?

2547
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:39,740
Or maybe it was his butt. It might be his butt.

2548
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:46,740
Oh, that would make more sounds. How many are these horses? Those have to be mini horses.

2549
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:49,740
Miniature horse stick inside of his beanus.

2550
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:54,740
Even miniature miniature horses. You can't, definitely.

2551
01:47:57,740 --> 01:48:00,740
Put some big things in there, but...

2552
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:06,740
Yeah, the butt makes more sounds than the urethra.

2553
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:11,740
I can't find the video.

2554
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:16,740
I don't want to see the video. I don't want to see the video and find the horse.

2555
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:25,740
I can't find the actual news or story of it. I don't think he showed a video of it.

2556
01:48:25,740 --> 01:48:27,740
Maybe it's made up.

2557
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:29,740
It could be.

2558
01:48:29,740 --> 01:48:32,740
I guess if it were his butt, that makes a lot more sounds.

2559
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:35,740
Yeah, it does.

2560
01:48:35,740 --> 01:48:40,740
That's a lot of horse miniatures to put inside of your urethra.

2561
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:44,740
That is a lot of horse miniatures, you're right.

2562
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:53,740
Have you seen those really cool little babies?

2563
01:48:53,740 --> 01:48:55,740
No.

2564
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:58,740
Oh shit, did Strani read us?

2565
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:02,740
Oh, Strani's just here. What did I just come into? Oh, not much.

2566
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:04,740
Hi, Strani.

2567
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:08,740
Hello. Hi, Strani. That's my first collab with Amy and me.

2568
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:13,740
You missed the best part.

2569
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:17,740
Yeah, we're just drawing. We're not doing anything else. We're just drawing.

2570
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:19,740
No.

2571
01:49:19,740 --> 01:49:21,740
Nothing else is going on here.

2572
01:49:23,740 --> 01:49:25,740
What's smegma?

2573
01:49:26,740 --> 01:49:33,740
Smegma? I don't know. I've never heard of that. I've never seen that. I don't know what that is.

2574
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:36,740
Do you know Denpa?

2575
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:39,740
Never heard of it before.

2576
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:42,740
No, maybe we should look it up.

2577
01:49:44,740 --> 01:49:49,740
I really want to get some of those mini babies for crafts. I was going to get some before.

2578
01:49:49,740 --> 01:49:58,740
I saw them at a store when I was traveling, but then they were cash only and I didn't have any cash because it was in different currencies.

2579
01:49:58,740 --> 01:50:04,740
I never got the weird little baby, weird baby beads. Weird baby beads.

2580
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:10,740
But I also lived in a place and they put the babies everywhere. The weird babies.

2581
01:50:10,740 --> 01:50:12,740
I'm not sure.

2582
01:50:12,740 --> 01:50:16,740
No, I searched weird babies and I got weird baby.

2583
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:21,740
I have a choker with a baby, like a little baby figure on it.

2584
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:27,740
Yeah, I had a lot of those. I'm getting some really fucked up babies on the internet.

2585
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:34,740
These are kind of cool. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2586
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:37,740
Do you see that?

2587
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:40,740
What the fuck is that?

2588
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:43,740
They're being mean.

2589
01:50:43,740 --> 01:50:49,740
They look like rat babies, like little jelly beans, like hamster babies.

2590
01:50:49,740 --> 01:50:54,740
Those aren't the babies that were in my house.

2591
01:50:54,740 --> 01:50:59,740
Those weren't the babies that were in my house, but they're different babies. They were like weird little babies.

2592
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:02,740
I'm trying to find the babies.

2593
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:05,740
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to put that one there.

2594
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:07,740
It's okay.

2595
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:09,740
Do you like them?

2596
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:16,740
I do. I do. It's very cute. I would definitely wear those around my neck.

2597
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:18,740
Weird babies.

2598
01:51:18,740 --> 01:51:20,740
Weird babies.

2599
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:22,740
Baby beads?

2600
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:25,740
Baby beads.

2601
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:29,740
No, these are like beads for babies. I want baby beads.

2602
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:32,740
I'm getting baby toys.

2603
01:51:32,740 --> 01:51:38,740
Beads resembling babies.

2604
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:41,740
Oh, hell yeah.

2605
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:44,740
Mini plastic babies.

2606
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:50,740
Crafting baby dolls for baby shower, shower, ice cube game.

2607
01:51:50,740 --> 01:51:57,740
Party decorations, baby birthday favors, baby bathing brown.

2608
01:51:57,740 --> 01:52:00,740
They were like these.

2609
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:03,740
Yeah, I have that, yeah.

2610
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:08,740
Yeah, these babies. These babies are awesome. Oh my god, there's colored ones.

2611
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:10,740
It's like, ew.

2612
01:52:10,740 --> 01:52:14,740
What do you mean colored ones? Like different, like rainbows?

2613
01:52:14,740 --> 01:52:18,740
Yeah, like, this is so fucking scary.

2614
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:22,740
Holy shit. Why did they arrange them like this?

2615
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:24,740
Why did they arrange them like this?

2616
01:52:24,740 --> 01:52:26,740
They look like creepy little aliens.

2617
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:28,740
Baby satan circle.

2618
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:30,740
Oh my god.

2619
01:52:30,740 --> 01:52:33,740
Mini plastic babies will be fun to put on top of anything.

2620
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:36,740
It shows them like taking over. Look at these.

2621
01:52:36,740 --> 01:52:39,740
They kind of look like the things around your neck.

2622
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:42,740
Mini plastic babies will be fun to put on top of anything.

2623
01:52:42,740 --> 01:52:44,740
What the fuck?

2624
01:52:44,740 --> 01:52:48,740
This is the kind of shit that people would put inside them for sure.

2625
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:51,740
Yeah, like I could see that being inside of something.

2626
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:53,740
The mini horse is like around this.

2627
01:52:53,740 --> 01:52:56,740
Yeah, but any bigger and I don't think it would fit.

2628
01:52:56,740 --> 01:53:00,740
I mean, you know, people, people, people find a way.

2629
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:04,740
Imagine wood soup with these. What is wood soup?

2630
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:07,740
It's like an ASMR trigger thing.

2631
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:09,740
Oh.

2632
01:53:09,740 --> 01:53:12,740
With like the bowls with the wooden beads.

2633
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:14,740
I know what you're talking about. Yeah.

2634
01:53:14,740 --> 01:53:17,740
Yeah, I don't like those. I hate the sounds that it makes.

2635
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:20,740
Really? I kind of like them.

2636
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:26,740
Yeah, I really don't like the sound of like stuff in water.

2637
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:29,740
Like bobbing around like anything like soupy.

2638
01:53:29,740 --> 01:53:31,740
I don't really fuck with it.

2639
01:53:31,740 --> 01:53:33,740
No?

2640
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:36,740
No, I'm not a big fan.

2641
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:38,740
I'm a big fan. I like here.

2642
01:53:38,740 --> 01:53:40,740
Ah!

2643
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:42,740
What did you do?

2644
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:44,740
I'm sorry.

2645
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:47,740
You're the worst little sister I've ever had.

2646
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:51,740
I hope I'm the only sister you've ever had.

2647
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:53,740
You are.

2648
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:56,740
Okay, so I'm also the best too, right?

2649
01:53:56,740 --> 01:53:59,740
Yeah, but you're also the worst.

2650
01:53:59,740 --> 01:54:02,740
Well, that's okay. I can be both.

2651
01:54:02,740 --> 01:54:06,740
As long as I'm the best, it's okay.

2652
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:11,740
You're the best at being the worst.

2653
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:16,740
At least I'm the best at something.

2654
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:20,740
You're the best at cleaning Smegma.

2655
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:23,740
I don't want to be the best at that.

2656
01:54:23,740 --> 01:54:26,740
I don't want to be the best at cleaning Smegma.

2657
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:28,740
No.

2658
01:54:28,740 --> 01:54:31,740
Why not? What's wrong with Smegma?

2659
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:35,740
You can be the best at cleaning Smegma, okay?

2660
01:54:35,740 --> 01:54:37,740
No.

2661
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:40,740
You're the best. You're so good at it.

2662
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:43,740
I've never done that before.

2663
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:49,740
So I'm not good at it. I've never done it before.

2664
01:54:49,740 --> 01:54:52,740
What do you mean you did it to me last night?

2665
01:54:52,740 --> 01:54:56,740
You get Smegma?

2666
01:54:58,740 --> 01:55:00,740
Yeah.

2667
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:02,740
You grow your own Smegma?

2668
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:04,740
Yeah, I grow it.

2669
01:55:04,740 --> 01:55:06,740
I farm it.

2670
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:08,740
You farm your own Smegma?

2671
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:10,740
Yeah.

2672
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:11,740
Do you sell it? What do you do with it?

2673
01:55:11,740 --> 01:55:13,740
I don't sell it.

2674
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:16,740
You can turn it into cheese.

2675
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:18,740
It's a delicacy.

2676
01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:21,740
Have you tried it yourself?

2677
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:23,740
Yeah, I love it.

2678
01:55:23,740 --> 01:55:25,740
You love it?

2679
01:55:25,740 --> 01:55:27,740
Mm-hmm.

2680
01:55:27,740 --> 01:55:29,740
Oh my god.

2681
01:55:29,740 --> 01:55:31,740
What the f**k?

2682
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:39,740
Then I'm sponsored by the Canadian Smegma Farmers.

2683
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:41,740
No!

2684
01:55:41,740 --> 01:55:44,740
No farming sponsors ever.

2685
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:47,740
Emmy can do farm sponsors.

2686
01:55:47,740 --> 01:55:49,740
She loves farming.

2687
01:55:49,740 --> 01:55:52,740
I don't like farmers.

2688
01:55:52,740 --> 01:55:55,740
What do you have against farmers now?

2689
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:57,740
You hate farmers too?

2690
01:55:57,740 --> 01:55:59,740
First Smegma now farms?

2691
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:01,740
What do you like?

2692
01:56:01,740 --> 01:56:03,740
Do you hate farmers?

2693
01:56:03,740 --> 01:56:07,740
I don't really have any strong opinions about them.

2694
01:56:07,740 --> 01:56:10,740
I don't think I really think about farmers that much.

2695
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:13,740
I don't think about farmers either.

2696
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:16,740
But I don't want to farm Smegma.

2697
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:18,740
Why not?

2698
01:56:18,740 --> 01:56:21,740
It's vegan.

2699
01:56:21,740 --> 01:56:24,740
It's like the vegan alternative to cheese.

2700
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:26,740
Yeah, it's vegan cheese.

2701
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:31,740
I'm not vegan, so I don't really need to farm it.

2702
01:56:39,740 --> 01:56:42,740
Farmer pin pals, it's over.

2703
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:44,740
No!

2704
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:48,740
The pin balls, not the pin balls.

2705
01:56:48,740 --> 01:56:51,740
The farmer pin balls, I never recover.

2706
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:53,740
I'm sorry.

2707
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:55,740
Any farmer pin balls out there,

2708
01:56:55,740 --> 01:56:59,740
you'll never have a chance to farm Smegma with me.

2709
01:56:59,740 --> 01:57:02,740
It's so fucking over.

2710
01:57:02,740 --> 01:57:05,740
They were banking on the collabs.

2711
01:57:05,740 --> 01:57:08,740
They were trying to get the farmer collabs.

2712
01:57:08,740 --> 01:57:13,740
The farmer collabs with Emmy's famous Emmy beats.

2713
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:20,740
Sorry, it's never happening.

2714
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:23,740
Farmer hates.

2715
01:57:23,740 --> 01:57:28,740
I have all VTubers hate farmers in the farming industry.

2716
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:37,740
I don't think VTubers and farmers really have a really similar fan base.

2717
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:42,740
I don't think they have many, you know, overlapping fans.

2718
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:46,740
There's farmers that have Facebooks.

2719
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:49,740
I was going to say, do you think they have fan bases?

2720
01:57:49,740 --> 01:57:53,740
They're like, oh yeah, farmer John back in it again.

2721
01:57:53,740 --> 01:57:56,740
I love it when you post on Facebook.

2722
01:57:56,740 --> 01:58:00,740
The highlight of the day is this Facebook farmer's post.

2723
01:58:00,740 --> 01:58:03,740
There has to be, because there's dating sites for farmers.

2724
01:58:03,740 --> 01:58:06,740
I don't remember what it was called.

2725
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:11,740
It was called onlyfarmers.com or farmersonly.com or something like that.

2726
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:15,740
And it's like a whole dating site for farmers.

2727
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:17,740
Do you know that one?

2728
01:58:17,740 --> 01:58:18,740
Onlyfarmers.

2729
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:19,740
I don't know it.

2730
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:23,740
I've seen, like, I know there's a lot of, like, niche dating sites, I guess,

2731
01:58:23,740 --> 01:58:25,740
because everyone is like...

2732
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:28,740
Yeah, it's called farmersonly.com.

2733
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:30,740
Single in the country.

2734
01:58:30,740 --> 01:58:32,740
And then you put your email address, zip code,

2735
01:58:32,740 --> 01:58:36,740
and then you save your woman or man and your age.

2736
01:58:36,740 --> 01:58:38,740
And then you can search for other farmers.

2737
01:58:38,740 --> 01:58:40,740
Should I search for farmers in my area?

2738
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:44,740
Yeah, see if there's any, like, sexy farmers.

2739
01:58:44,740 --> 01:58:46,740
Okay.

2740
01:58:49,740 --> 01:58:55,740
I feel like, I feel like I'm just going to find, like, a bunch of really old people.

2741
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:57,740
Don't you like those?

2742
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:02,740
Well, I'm imagining, like, 70, 80.

2743
01:59:02,740 --> 01:59:08,740
Yeah, like, almost 70, but maybe like, like, like 50, like, you know,

2744
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:11,740
not many young people own farms, you know?

2745
01:59:11,740 --> 01:59:16,740
You should try to, like, date them and explain to B2B to, like, a farmer.

2746
01:59:16,740 --> 01:59:18,740
Wait, this is American, right?

2747
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:20,740
This has to be an American site.

2748
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:23,740
I need an American zip code.

2749
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:25,740
American...

2750
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:30,740
McDonald's Florida zip code.

2751
01:59:31,740 --> 01:59:34,740
Here.

2752
01:59:34,740 --> 01:59:41,740
I want to use the McDonald's in Boca Raton, Florida.

2753
01:59:41,740 --> 01:59:42,740
Boca Raton?

2754
01:59:42,740 --> 01:59:43,740
That's not a real place.

2755
01:59:43,740 --> 01:59:45,740
Boca Raton.

2756
01:59:45,740 --> 01:59:47,740
Wait, I don't understand how...

2757
01:59:47,740 --> 01:59:49,740
How do you spell Boca Raton?

2758
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:52,740
I don't understand how zip codes work for Americans.

2759
01:59:52,740 --> 01:59:54,740
I just put a number.

2760
01:59:54,740 --> 01:59:58,740
I am a woman looking for a man.

2761
01:59:58,740 --> 01:59:59,740
Enter my age.

2762
01:59:59,740 --> 02:00:00,740
30.

2763
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:03,740
Search now.

2764
02:00:03,740 --> 02:00:04,740
I'm Amy.

2765
02:00:04,740 --> 02:00:09,740
I'm 30, and I'm looking for a farmer that can...

2766
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:10,740
My age.

2767
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:11,740
Oh, my God.

2768
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:13,740
There's actually 7,000...

2769
02:00:13,740 --> 02:00:14,740
Oh, wait, that's members.

2770
02:00:14,740 --> 02:00:21,740
I thought there were 7,000 farmers in Boca Raton, McDonald's, Florida.

2771
02:00:21,740 --> 02:00:22,740
See, that's a lot of...

2772
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:23,740
This is a big...

2773
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:25,740
I guess it's a big farmer's thing.

2774
02:00:25,740 --> 02:00:26,740
Maybe.

2775
02:00:26,740 --> 02:00:27,740
You know what?

2776
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:30,740
Some of them aren't actually that old.

2777
02:00:30,740 --> 02:00:31,740
I guess...

2778
02:00:31,740 --> 02:00:32,740
Oh, you know what?

2779
02:00:32,740 --> 02:00:34,740
I think it's because I put my age as 30.

2780
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:38,740
It's showing me other farmers that are around 30 years old, you know?

2781
02:00:38,740 --> 02:00:41,740
Can you change the ages?

2782
02:00:41,740 --> 02:00:45,740
I want to see really old farmers.

2783
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:48,740
You want to see old farmers?

2784
02:00:48,740 --> 02:00:55,740
Imagine a sexy old lady farmer.

2785
02:00:55,740 --> 02:00:57,740
She's a lesbian.

2786
02:00:57,740 --> 02:01:01,740
Lesbian farmer lady who butchers.

2787
02:01:01,740 --> 02:01:04,740
So you want me to look for the girl farmers?

2788
02:01:04,740 --> 02:01:09,740
Yeah, I want a sexy, sexy, 50-year-old farmer.

2789
02:01:09,740 --> 02:01:11,740
And she's a regular smoker.

2790
02:01:11,740 --> 02:01:12,740
I can choose a lot.

2791
02:01:12,740 --> 02:01:14,740
Oh, wait, no, that's my own...

2792
02:01:14,740 --> 02:01:15,740
That's never mind.

2793
02:01:15,740 --> 02:01:16,740
Never mind.

2794
02:01:16,740 --> 02:01:17,740
I thought I could choose...

2795
02:01:17,740 --> 02:01:18,740
No, I wanted to be a smoker.

2796
02:01:18,740 --> 02:01:19,740
Yeah, I wanted to be a smoker.

2797
02:01:19,740 --> 02:01:22,740
I wanted to smoke cigarettes and put them around me.

2798
02:01:22,740 --> 02:01:23,740
Lesbian farmer.

2799
02:01:23,740 --> 02:01:27,740
Okay, wait, edit my profile.

2800
02:01:27,740 --> 02:01:31,740
I'm a female looking for female employment.

2801
02:01:31,740 --> 02:01:35,740
Apparently they automatically chose that I raise alpacas.

2802
02:01:35,740 --> 02:01:39,740
How do I change my age so I can get farmers around my age?

2803
02:01:39,740 --> 02:01:40,740
Save.

2804
02:01:40,740 --> 02:01:42,740
I don't know.

2805
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:47,740
They don't let me change unless I put my first name and last name.

2806
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:55,740
Farmer girl is my first name and last name.

2807
02:01:55,740 --> 02:01:58,740
I wonder how many people I named farmer girl.

2808
02:01:58,740 --> 02:02:06,740
Okay, my ideal match is between the ages of 55 and 99.

2809
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:11,740
And I want someone that's a regular smoker and body type.

2810
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:14,740
Big and beautiful.

2811
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:15,740
And I'm looking for long term.

2812
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:16,740
They're the options.

2813
02:02:16,740 --> 02:02:19,740
Big and beautiful.

2814
02:02:19,740 --> 02:02:22,740
Oh, the options for the body type.

2815
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:26,740
There's slim, average, athletic, a few extra pounds.

2816
02:02:26,740 --> 02:02:28,740
Pleasantly plump, big and beautiful.

2817
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:32,740
And then tell you later.

2818
02:02:32,740 --> 02:02:34,740
I don't know what tell you later.

2819
02:02:34,740 --> 02:02:37,740
Tell you later.

2820
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:38,740
Tell you later.

2821
02:02:38,740 --> 02:02:40,740
What does tell you later mean?

2822
02:02:40,740 --> 02:02:44,740
I don't know, but I like it.

2823
02:02:44,740 --> 02:02:45,740
Tell you later.

2824
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:48,740
Let's see who my new matches are now.

2825
02:02:48,740 --> 02:02:50,740
How do I go?

2826
02:02:50,740 --> 02:02:51,740
How do I?

2827
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:52,740
I don't know.

2828
02:02:52,740 --> 02:03:00,740
I got canceled on Reddit before because I said I had a 65 year old girlfriend.

2829
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:03,740
And you got canceled on Reddit for that?

2830
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:08,740
Yeah, I posted in like crawler sightings and I said my girlfriend's 65.

2831
02:03:08,740 --> 02:03:09,740
This on her ring camera last night.

2832
02:03:09,740 --> 02:03:11,740
Does anyone know what this is?

2833
02:03:11,740 --> 02:03:19,740
And all their replies are about my 65 year old girlfriend that doesn't exist.

2834
02:03:19,740 --> 02:03:26,740
And I mean, this is my image.

2835
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:29,740
What the fuck is that?

2836
02:03:29,740 --> 02:03:31,740
What do you think it is?

2837
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:32,740
What does it look like?

2838
02:03:32,740 --> 02:03:33,740
I don't know.

2839
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:37,740
My 65 year old girlfriend caught it on her doorbell.

2840
02:03:37,740 --> 02:03:40,740
I don't see anything in that photo.

2841
02:03:40,740 --> 02:03:42,740
What do you see?

2842
02:03:42,740 --> 02:03:43,740
Nothing.

2843
02:03:43,740 --> 02:03:45,740
What do you mean you see?

2844
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:46,740
It's real.

2845
02:03:46,740 --> 02:03:48,740
Is that an alien?

2846
02:03:48,740 --> 02:03:51,740
Yeah, it is.

2847
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:52,740
Oh.

2848
02:03:52,740 --> 02:04:04,740
It's me, but all the comments, I got like 486 comments from people trying to guess what

2849
02:04:04,740 --> 02:04:05,740
it was.

2850
02:04:05,740 --> 02:04:11,740
It's literally like my brood model, but they're like, it's a bug selfie right up on the camera.

2851
02:04:11,740 --> 02:04:13,740
And they're like arguing.

2852
02:04:13,740 --> 02:04:16,740
Wait, what is it actually though?

2853
02:04:16,740 --> 02:04:18,740
It's my brood.

2854
02:04:18,740 --> 02:04:20,740
It's me.

2855
02:04:20,740 --> 02:04:22,740
It's me.

2856
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:23,740
What?

2857
02:04:23,740 --> 02:04:25,740
Did you edit it?

2858
02:04:25,740 --> 02:04:28,740
I have big eyes.

2859
02:04:28,740 --> 02:04:31,740
What the fuck is going on?

2860
02:04:31,740 --> 02:04:33,740
I have big eyes.

2861
02:04:33,740 --> 02:04:34,740
Whoa.

2862
02:04:34,740 --> 02:04:35,740
You know what?

2863
02:04:35,740 --> 02:04:41,740
Some of these farmer, I found a 68 year old farmer lady that actually is really muscular.

2864
02:04:41,740 --> 02:04:43,740
Is that what you're into?

2865
02:04:43,740 --> 02:04:46,740
Wait, I want to see if she's sexy.

2866
02:04:46,740 --> 02:04:48,740
She's cute.

2867
02:04:48,740 --> 02:04:52,740
Wait, so hard to me.

2868
02:04:52,740 --> 02:04:54,740
She's not bad at all.

2869
02:04:54,740 --> 02:04:56,740
Her name is cowgirl.

2870
02:04:56,740 --> 02:04:57,740
What?

2871
02:04:57,740 --> 02:05:02,740
Her name is cowgirl and then followed by a bunch of numbers.

2872
02:05:02,740 --> 02:05:07,740
I sent her, I sent you her profile.

2873
02:05:07,740 --> 02:05:08,740
She's pretty muscular.

2874
02:05:08,740 --> 02:05:09,740
Cowgirl.

2875
02:05:09,740 --> 02:05:12,740
No, I need to make an account.

2876
02:05:12,740 --> 02:05:14,740
What is this website?

2877
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:15,740
Search now.

2878
02:05:15,740 --> 02:05:17,740
Why does this website look like this?

2879
02:05:17,740 --> 02:05:18,740
It's really bad.

2880
02:05:18,740 --> 02:05:23,740
Most of the farmer ladies that are 70 year olds, 70 year old don't really want to show

2881
02:05:23,740 --> 02:05:26,740
their pictures.

2882
02:05:26,740 --> 02:05:40,740
I'm a man looking for a woman and I'm 65.

2883
02:05:40,740 --> 02:05:41,740
Search now.

2884
02:05:41,740 --> 02:05:42,740
Take a photo.

2885
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:44,740
No, I don't want a photo.

2886
02:05:44,740 --> 02:05:49,740
Well, there's 7,359 people on the menu now.

2887
02:05:49,740 --> 02:05:50,740
That's crazy.

2888
02:05:50,740 --> 02:05:55,740
Oh, there's some cameras.

2889
02:05:55,740 --> 02:05:56,740
Oh, whoa.

2890
02:05:56,740 --> 02:06:00,740
I'm learning some cute formulas.

2891
02:06:00,740 --> 02:06:03,740
Learn for free, favorite.

2892
02:06:03,740 --> 02:06:06,740
Looking for a wife, please help me.

2893
02:06:06,740 --> 02:06:12,740
She likes is 4'3 to 7'11.

2894
02:06:12,740 --> 02:06:16,740
She's really keeping her options open.

2895
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:21,740
Yeah, she's speaking of women ages 24 to 68.

2896
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:22,740
Oh my.

2897
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:26,740
She's 4 foot 3 to 7 foot 11.

2898
02:06:26,740 --> 02:06:30,740
Yeah, I mean, she's keeping her options open, you know?

2899
02:06:30,740 --> 02:06:39,740
Don't want to miss anyone that might be your soulmate just because they're 4 foot 2 or 4 foot 3.

2900
02:06:39,740 --> 02:06:41,740
Or 7 foot 11.

2901
02:06:41,740 --> 02:06:45,740
Or 7 foot 11.

2902
02:06:45,740 --> 02:06:47,740
Is that even possible?

2903
02:06:47,740 --> 02:06:51,740
To be 7 foot 11? I don't know. Is it? Probably.

2904
02:06:51,740 --> 02:06:55,740
There's probably some people out there that are 7-eleven.

2905
02:06:55,740 --> 02:06:58,740
There's no way. 7-eleven?

2906
02:06:58,740 --> 02:07:00,740
7-eleven.

2907
02:07:00,740 --> 02:07:02,740
That's way too big.

2908
02:07:05,740 --> 02:07:07,740
Nobody is 7-eleven.

2909
02:07:07,740 --> 02:07:09,740
Maybe they are.

2910
02:07:09,740 --> 02:07:11,740
No way.

2911
02:07:11,740 --> 02:07:16,740
What? Are you saying all the 7-eleven people aren't allowed to have dating profiles now?

2912
02:07:16,740 --> 02:07:23,740
No, I'm saying that. I don't think anyone that tall exists.

2913
02:07:23,740 --> 02:07:25,740
I'm sure they do.

2914
02:07:29,740 --> 02:07:32,740
Yeah, any 7-eleven pin pals out there?

2915
02:07:32,740 --> 02:07:34,740
Make yourself known.

2916
02:07:34,740 --> 02:07:36,740
Now. Speak now or forever.

2917
02:07:36,740 --> 02:07:40,740
Hold your something. I don't know how it goes.

2918
02:07:40,740 --> 02:07:44,740
Speak now or forever. Hold your piece.

2919
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:46,740
I don't know.

2920
02:08:02,740 --> 02:08:04,740
I'm struggling so much with this line.

2921
02:08:05,740 --> 02:08:09,740
Real and surreal and valid.

2922
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:13,740
So true to start. Sorry, I don't know what came over me.

2923
02:08:13,740 --> 02:08:18,740
It's okay. The tallest person living is 8 feet tall.

2924
02:08:18,740 --> 02:08:21,740
So 8 feet 2.8 inches.

2925
02:08:21,740 --> 02:08:23,740
It would have to...

2926
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:27,740
No, not even that guy would qualify because he's too tall.

2927
02:08:28,740 --> 02:08:35,740
Yeah, but I'm saying if the tallest person in the world is 8 feet tall, then 7-eleven is still completely, you know, achievable.

2928
02:08:44,740 --> 02:08:46,740
How tall are you?

2929
02:08:46,740 --> 02:08:48,740
Oh, unfortunately I'm...

2930
02:08:48,740 --> 02:08:51,740
Fuck, I never remembered my height, to be honest.

2931
02:08:51,740 --> 02:08:53,740
It's like 4...

2932
02:08:54,740 --> 02:08:58,740
It starts at 140 centimeters there. I remember the...

2933
02:08:58,740 --> 02:09:00,740
Oh, small.

2934
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:01,740
Yeah.

2935
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:12,740
I love Indian.

2936
02:09:12,740 --> 02:09:14,740
And you're so quiet as soon.

2937
02:09:17,740 --> 02:09:20,740
Did you say that or is that someone in chat that said that?

2938
02:09:20,740 --> 02:09:22,740
Me.

2939
02:09:22,740 --> 02:09:24,740
Oh, thank you.

2940
02:09:24,740 --> 02:09:27,740
Why, were you hoping it was a chatter? You're disappointed that I said it.

2941
02:09:27,740 --> 02:09:31,740
No, I just wasn't sure if you were reading out chatter or if you were saying that yourself.

2942
02:09:31,740 --> 02:09:33,740
No.

2943
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:36,740
They're just discussing heights now, I think.

2944
02:09:43,740 --> 02:09:46,740
I'm 4'5'9".

2945
02:09:46,740 --> 02:09:49,740
4'5'9".

2946
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:54,740
4.59 feet, so basically I'm 5'9", basically.

2947
02:09:58,740 --> 02:10:01,740
5'9", that's kind of tall, 5'9".

2948
02:10:02,740 --> 02:10:04,740
Yeah, it's pretty tall.

2949
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:07,740
It's not bad, right?

2950
02:10:07,740 --> 02:10:10,740
5 feet tall and 9 inches.

2951
02:10:10,740 --> 02:10:12,740
Not bad at all.

2952
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:14,740
Why are you so tall?

2953
02:10:14,740 --> 02:10:17,740
I just had a growth spurt, you know.

2954
02:10:19,740 --> 02:10:21,740
Oh.

2955
02:10:24,740 --> 02:10:26,740
You're so cool.

2956
02:10:26,740 --> 02:10:29,740
She's overcompensating, I'm not overcompensating for nothing.

2957
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:31,740
I'm very cool and tall.

2958
02:10:38,740 --> 02:10:42,740
Oh shit, I keep accidentally downloading my drawing.

2959
02:10:43,740 --> 02:10:46,740
Why are you, is it like a hot key?

2960
02:10:46,740 --> 02:10:54,740
Yeah, I keep Ctrl-S'ing, because that's how I save my art in normal art programs.

2961
02:10:54,740 --> 02:11:02,740
But in this thing, yeah, in this thing, Ctrl-S is to download the drawing you're working on.

2962
02:11:02,740 --> 02:11:04,740
So I keep downloading it.

2963
02:11:05,740 --> 02:11:06,740
What?

2964
02:11:06,740 --> 02:11:08,740
Evil?

2965
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:16,740
What if you were sick and twisted?

2966
02:11:16,740 --> 02:11:19,740
What does that mean? What do you mean?

2967
02:11:21,740 --> 02:11:25,740
Just wait, what if you were sick and twisted?

2968
02:11:25,740 --> 02:11:29,740
Are you referencing me? What do you mean, sick and twisted?

2969
02:11:29,740 --> 02:11:32,740
No, you're not saying it right.

2970
02:11:32,740 --> 02:11:34,740
What? How am I supposed to say it?

2971
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:38,740
Sick and twisted.

2972
02:11:38,740 --> 02:11:42,740
I've never heard that before. Is this what kind of meme?

2973
02:11:45,740 --> 02:11:48,740
What is sick and twisted?

2974
02:11:53,740 --> 02:11:55,740
I don't know, I just made it up.

2975
02:11:56,740 --> 02:11:58,740
Okay.

2976
02:11:58,740 --> 02:12:01,740
You're making up your own memes?

2977
02:12:01,740 --> 02:12:05,740
Yeah, I'm inventing them just for you. Do you like it?

2978
02:12:05,740 --> 02:12:10,740
Thank you, yeah. I love sick and twisted.

2979
02:12:10,740 --> 02:12:12,740
No, you said it wrong again.

2980
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:14,740
How am I supposed to say it?

2981
02:12:14,740 --> 02:12:17,740
Sick and twisted.

2982
02:12:17,740 --> 02:12:20,740
Sick and twisted.

2983
02:12:20,740 --> 02:12:24,740
Yeah, you need to say it like, twisted.

2984
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:27,740
You need to be twisted. You need to sound twisted.

2985
02:12:27,740 --> 02:12:29,740
Don't even say it's twisted.

2986
02:12:31,740 --> 02:12:33,740
What?

2987
02:12:33,740 --> 02:12:35,740
What?

2988
02:12:38,740 --> 02:12:46,740
Hey guys, it's me and me of the first generation, the Allure generation in Daud.

2989
02:12:46,740 --> 02:12:48,740
And I'm sick and twisted.

2990
02:12:50,740 --> 02:12:52,740
You want me to say that?

2991
02:12:52,740 --> 02:12:54,740
Yes.

2992
02:12:55,740 --> 02:13:02,740
Hey guys, it's me and me from the first generation of the Allure and Daud.

2993
02:13:02,740 --> 02:13:05,740
And I'm sick and twisted.

2994
02:13:07,740 --> 02:13:09,740
Are you happy?

2995
02:13:09,740 --> 02:13:13,740
Do you want to say something actually like sick and twisted?

2996
02:13:13,740 --> 02:13:15,740
Sure.

2997
02:13:15,740 --> 02:13:19,740
I checked my emails really quickly.

2998
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:29,740
Okay, I have my farmers only registration and then I got another email, but it's just the arrangement is funny.

2999
02:13:29,740 --> 02:13:33,740
Why did someone try to DM you on farmersonly.com?

3000
02:13:33,740 --> 02:13:36,740
No, it's the juxtaposition.

3001
02:13:36,740 --> 02:13:39,740
Wait, I sent it in the DM.

3002
02:13:40,740 --> 02:13:45,740
The order. It's literally like four minutes after.

3003
02:13:45,740 --> 02:13:48,740
Oh my god, you got invited to be a Twitch partner?

3004
02:13:49,740 --> 02:13:53,740
Yeah, but it's directly next to the farmers only.

3005
02:13:53,740 --> 02:13:57,740
It's like to activate your farmers only.com account.

3006
02:13:57,740 --> 02:13:59,740
Congratulations.

3007
02:13:59,740 --> 02:14:01,740
I'm sick and twisted.

3008
02:14:02,740 --> 02:14:04,740
That's so exciting.

3009
02:14:05,740 --> 02:14:09,740
I went to go check for my farmers only information.

3010
02:14:09,740 --> 02:14:12,740
I wanted to activate my farmers only account.

3011
02:14:12,740 --> 02:14:14,740
I used the same email.

3012
02:14:15,740 --> 02:14:18,740
I got that.

3013
02:14:18,740 --> 02:14:20,740
That's so exciting.

3014
02:14:22,740 --> 02:14:25,740
You don't have to add anything if you're done.

3015
02:14:25,740 --> 02:14:28,740
I want to draw some pimples.

3016
02:14:30,740 --> 02:14:34,740
I just keep drawing because you're still drawing so I keep going.

3017
02:14:34,740 --> 02:14:38,740
Yeah, I was trying to polish it a bit.

3018
02:14:38,740 --> 02:14:40,740
I don't know.

3019
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:43,740
I don't know, that's really polished.

3020
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:47,740
I'm like, my brain doesn't work right.

3021
02:14:47,740 --> 02:14:49,740
That's okay.

3022
02:14:53,740 --> 02:14:55,740
I don't know how to draw a pimple.

3023
02:14:55,740 --> 02:14:59,740
We have pimples and we have dent pals.

3024
02:14:59,740 --> 02:15:02,740
Wait, is that the name of your fan base, dent pals?

3025
02:15:02,740 --> 02:15:06,740
Yeah, dent pals. We both have pals.

3026
02:15:06,740 --> 02:15:09,740
Oh my god, I have no clue. That's so cute.

3027
02:15:09,740 --> 02:15:13,740
Yeah, pals, pals, pals. The pals can be pals together.

3028
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:15,740
Dent pals and kin pals.

3029
02:15:15,740 --> 02:15:18,740
What do the dent pals look like?

3030
02:15:21,740 --> 02:15:25,740
I'll draw one. I was going to get an image, a reference image,

3031
02:15:25,740 --> 02:15:27,740
but it's quicker to draw one.

3032
02:15:27,740 --> 02:15:31,740
It literally looks exactly like this, but green.

3033
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:35,740
That's adorable. I love dent pals.

3034
02:15:35,740 --> 02:15:37,740
This is literally dent pals.

3035
02:15:37,740 --> 02:15:41,740
It looks like a cute little booger. I love it.

3036
02:15:41,740 --> 02:15:44,740
Yeah, this is a pretty cute little booger.

3037
02:15:44,740 --> 02:15:47,740
I agree. They're pretty kawaii boogers.

3038
02:15:47,740 --> 02:15:52,740
Make the dent pals and the kin pals make out with each other?

3039
02:15:52,740 --> 02:15:56,740
No, dent pals only have sex with other dent pals.

3040
02:15:56,740 --> 02:16:00,740
Well, they don't have sex. They asexually produce.

3041
02:16:00,740 --> 02:16:03,740
Well, they can just kiss. They don't have to have sex.

3042
02:16:03,740 --> 02:16:05,740
They can just kiss.

3043
02:16:05,740 --> 02:16:07,740
Okay, thank you.

3044
02:16:07,740 --> 02:16:09,740
Okay, that's no problem here.

3045
02:16:09,740 --> 02:16:12,740
I don't want them to be ludified.

3046
02:16:12,740 --> 02:16:15,740
It's not ludiculesome.

3047
02:16:15,740 --> 02:16:18,740
I don't want any luded dent pals.

3048
02:16:18,740 --> 02:16:20,740
It should be a crime.

3049
02:16:20,740 --> 02:16:23,740
There will not be a single luded dent pal.

3050
02:16:23,740 --> 02:16:27,740
Thank god. It's a luded dent pal.

3051
02:16:27,740 --> 02:16:31,740
Wow, I found a cigarette, bro. I found a cigarette.

3052
02:16:31,740 --> 02:16:34,740
What if you were sick and twisted and had a cigarette?

3053
02:16:34,740 --> 02:16:36,740
I forgot that I had this.

3054
02:16:36,740 --> 02:16:38,740
Wait, can I put this? Wait.

3055
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:42,740
Let me get this shit on me.

3056
02:16:42,740 --> 02:16:45,740
Let me get this shit on.

3057
02:16:45,740 --> 02:16:48,740
What if we both had cigarette?

3058
02:16:48,740 --> 02:16:50,740
Cigarettes and arts.

3059
02:16:50,740 --> 02:16:53,740
I'm like, wait, where'd it go?

3060
02:16:53,740 --> 02:16:55,740
There it is. Wait, this is...

3061
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:59,740
Oh god, I don't even know what this works. Do you see my arm?

3062
02:16:59,740 --> 02:17:02,740
I do see the cigarette hand, yeah.

3063
02:17:02,740 --> 02:17:05,740
Okay, just like...

3064
02:17:05,740 --> 02:17:08,740
Crop me.

3065
02:17:08,740 --> 02:17:09,740
Just a cigarette.

3066
02:17:09,740 --> 02:17:13,740
I have my pen in one hand and a cigarette in the other.

3067
02:17:13,740 --> 02:17:16,740
It is so sick and twisted.

3068
02:17:16,740 --> 02:17:20,740
I love just smoking a cigarette.

3069
02:17:20,740 --> 02:17:22,740
Hanging out with my little sis.

3070
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:27,740
And then putting the cigarette butts on her.

3071
02:17:27,740 --> 02:17:29,740
What?

3072
02:17:29,740 --> 02:17:32,740
You don't need to cover your breasts and bandages

3073
02:17:32,740 --> 02:17:36,740
when you can just use bruises.

3074
02:17:36,740 --> 02:17:40,740
To cover my boobs?

3075
02:17:40,740 --> 02:17:44,740
Not built on censorship.

3076
02:17:44,740 --> 02:17:48,740
But bruises to cover my boobs? What?

3077
02:17:48,740 --> 02:17:51,740
Yeah.

3078
02:17:51,740 --> 02:17:53,740
I don't understand.

3079
02:17:53,740 --> 02:17:56,740
Because then it wouldn't be skin colored.

3080
02:17:56,740 --> 02:18:02,740
But I think the algorithm will still understand that it's boobs.

3081
02:18:04,740 --> 02:18:09,740
And then I'll get banned for showing tits on youtube.com.

3082
02:18:09,740 --> 02:18:13,740
No, you're literally topless right now.

3083
02:18:13,740 --> 02:18:20,740
Can you show me how you can color in your using the bucket tool?

3084
02:18:20,740 --> 02:18:24,740
What is this? It's nothing so disgusting!

3085
02:18:24,740 --> 02:18:25,740
What?

3086
02:18:25,740 --> 02:18:27,740
He's lying to me!

3087
02:18:27,740 --> 02:18:32,740
What's wrong with him? He's kissing the tin pal.

3088
02:18:32,740 --> 02:18:35,740
He's kissing the tin pal.

3089
02:18:35,740 --> 02:18:39,740
It has a gross border but you just need to make sure that the line is closed.

3090
02:18:39,740 --> 02:18:41,740
That's the only thing, that the line is closed.

3091
02:18:41,740 --> 02:18:45,740
And I just did it on the same layer because it makes life easier.

3092
02:18:45,740 --> 02:18:48,740
I'm really bad at making sure the line is closed.

3093
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:52,740
I'll just quickly shittily color it in there.

3094
02:18:52,740 --> 02:18:54,740
What's the pin pal reference again?

3095
02:18:54,740 --> 02:18:56,740
Give me the pin pal.

3096
02:18:56,740 --> 02:18:58,740
I don't even have any.

3097
02:18:58,740 --> 02:19:01,740
Let me see if I can send you one.

3098
02:19:01,740 --> 02:19:04,740
It's gonna start.

3099
02:19:04,740 --> 02:19:08,740
There, I sent you.

3100
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:11,740
I still don't know why my name is sound wizard.

3101
02:19:11,740 --> 02:19:12,740
It just got changed.

3102
02:19:12,740 --> 02:19:14,740
Wait, I think I can change it.

3103
02:19:14,740 --> 02:19:16,740
I didn't realize I could change it.

3104
02:19:16,740 --> 02:19:18,740
Wait.

3105
02:19:18,740 --> 02:19:20,740
Oh, now I'm dump a bush.

3106
02:19:20,740 --> 02:19:22,740
That's so fucking weird.

3107
02:19:22,740 --> 02:19:25,740
Oh, there he is. He's so cute. I really like him.

3108
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:28,740
He reminds me kind of of the pumpkins in Steven Universe.

3109
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:29,740
Do you like Steven Universe?

3110
02:19:29,740 --> 02:19:32,740
I've never watched Steven Universe.

3111
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:39,740
It's like really later in the series but they have a character that's just a pumpkin.

3112
02:19:39,740 --> 02:19:43,740
But it's like a pet pumpkin. It's sentient.

3113
02:19:43,740 --> 02:19:46,740
It's a sentient cat pumpkin.

3114
02:19:46,740 --> 02:19:48,740
Let me look it up.

3115
02:19:48,740 --> 02:19:51,740
Steven Universe is the talking one.

3116
02:19:51,740 --> 02:19:54,740
There's a talking pumpkin.

3117
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:58,740
Steven Universe's pumpkin is the first thing that shows up as a pumpkin guy.

3118
02:19:58,740 --> 02:20:00,740
Oh, I see him. I see him.

3119
02:20:00,740 --> 02:20:02,740
Oh, he's so cute.

3120
02:20:02,740 --> 02:20:05,740
And there's a watermelon one too.

3121
02:20:05,740 --> 02:20:11,740
One of Steven's powers is to make sentient plants and stuff.

3122
02:20:11,740 --> 02:20:13,740
Can you spit?

3123
02:20:13,740 --> 02:20:15,740
Ew.

3124
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:20,740
Yeah, he got spit on a pumpkin and he accidentally made it come to life.

3125
02:20:20,740 --> 02:20:25,740
That's adorable. I see what you mean.

3126
02:20:25,740 --> 02:20:28,740
Yeah, it's kind of the same thing.

3127
02:20:28,740 --> 02:20:31,740
You should watch Steven Universe. Do you want to watch it with me?

3128
02:20:31,740 --> 02:20:35,740
Sure, we can. I've never watched it before. I've never seen it.

3129
02:20:35,740 --> 02:20:38,740
It never seemed interesting to me.

3130
02:20:38,740 --> 02:20:41,740
I think you might at least like the art.

3131
02:20:41,740 --> 02:20:44,740
The background art is really nice.

3132
02:20:44,740 --> 02:20:47,740
Pin pals.

3133
02:20:47,740 --> 02:20:50,740
Ta-da!

3134
02:20:50,740 --> 02:20:53,740
Ta-da! Why are they kissing?

3135
02:20:53,740 --> 02:20:55,740
They're kissing?

3136
02:20:55,740 --> 02:20:57,740
What is their shouldn't they? Den pin pals?

3137
02:20:57,740 --> 02:21:00,740
Den... Den pin... Oh, you're right.

3138
02:21:00,740 --> 02:21:02,740
Den pin pals.

3139
02:21:02,740 --> 02:21:04,740
Pin den pals.

3140
02:21:04,740 --> 02:21:06,740
Pen...

3141
02:21:06,740 --> 02:21:08,740
Pin pals.

3142
02:21:08,740 --> 02:21:10,740
Pin pals.

3143
02:21:10,740 --> 02:21:12,740
Pen... Pen pals.

3144
02:21:12,740 --> 02:21:15,740
Big pen pals. They become pen pals.

3145
02:21:15,740 --> 02:21:17,740
Pen pals?

3146
02:21:17,740 --> 02:21:20,740
Pen... Pen plus den.

3147
02:21:20,740 --> 02:21:22,740
Pen pals.

3148
02:21:22,740 --> 02:21:24,740
Yeah, they can be pen pals now, yeah.

3149
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:26,740
Pen pals, yeah.

3150
02:21:26,740 --> 02:21:28,740
Coink.

3151
02:21:28,740 --> 02:21:30,740
What did their baby look like?

3152
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:32,740
What did their baby look like?

3153
02:21:32,740 --> 02:21:34,740
I don't know.

3154
02:21:34,740 --> 02:21:36,740
This one would be like pumpkin-headed.

3155
02:21:36,740 --> 02:21:38,740
I didn't think it was that weird.

3156
02:21:38,740 --> 02:21:41,740
Pumpkin-headed.

3157
02:21:41,740 --> 02:21:44,740
Crossbreeding the pals.

3158
02:21:44,740 --> 02:21:46,740
This...

3159
02:21:46,740 --> 02:21:49,740
I'm trying to draw it. It looks absolutely disgusting.

3160
02:21:49,740 --> 02:21:53,740
No, it's not that bad. It looks like a cute little ghost.

3161
02:21:53,740 --> 02:21:55,740
Oh, go, go, go.

3162
02:21:55,740 --> 02:21:58,740
I like their pumpkin mouth. Pumpkin mouths are really cute.

3163
02:21:58,740 --> 02:22:00,740
Like a pumpkin.

3164
02:22:00,740 --> 02:22:02,740
Yeah.

3165
02:22:04,740 --> 02:22:06,740
And then he needs the thing.

3166
02:22:06,740 --> 02:22:08,740
And then his little knees.

3167
02:22:08,740 --> 02:22:11,740
And then he just has like little melons.

3168
02:22:11,740 --> 02:22:14,740
Wait, that's actually really cute.

3169
02:22:14,740 --> 02:22:16,740
It is so cute.

3170
02:22:16,740 --> 02:22:19,740
What is it called, the pen pals?

3171
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:21,740
I guess so.

3172
02:22:21,740 --> 02:22:23,740
Wait, that is actually cute.

3173
02:22:23,740 --> 02:22:25,740
Oh, I love him.

3174
02:22:25,740 --> 02:22:28,740
I'll make him orange with like...

3175
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:30,740
What?

3176
02:22:31,740 --> 02:22:34,740
And yeah, he closed the holes really quickly here.

3177
02:22:34,740 --> 02:22:36,740
Did he close them?

3178
02:22:36,740 --> 02:22:38,740
He did not.

3179
02:22:38,740 --> 02:22:40,740
You can tell they like the fucking leg that...

3180
02:22:40,740 --> 02:22:42,740
Oh, there it is.

3181
02:22:42,740 --> 02:22:45,740
It's so hard to see the little holes of me drawing.

3182
02:22:45,740 --> 02:22:48,740
In the air, each of the bosoms barely touch it.

3183
02:22:48,740 --> 02:22:50,740
You're gonna touch yours?

3184
02:22:50,740 --> 02:22:53,740
I don't have a bosom to fucking touch with Denpa's bosoms.

3185
02:22:53,740 --> 02:22:56,740
Yeah, and I think you two might not like it.

3186
02:22:56,740 --> 02:22:58,740
You two might not like it.

3187
02:22:58,740 --> 02:23:00,740
The way you show a little bit of my boobs,

3188
02:23:00,740 --> 02:23:02,740
you two might not like that.

3189
02:23:02,740 --> 02:23:04,740
Yeah.

3190
02:23:04,740 --> 02:23:06,740
Oh, no.

3191
02:23:06,740 --> 02:23:08,740
I'll make a censored version.

3192
02:23:08,740 --> 02:23:10,740
You can put like an emoji over it.

3193
02:23:10,740 --> 02:23:12,740
No, I don't want to put an emoji.

3194
02:23:12,740 --> 02:23:14,740
I could put...

3195
02:23:14,740 --> 02:23:16,740
We can put fishnet over top of that,

3196
02:23:16,740 --> 02:23:18,740
and that's probably enough to censor it.

3197
02:23:18,740 --> 02:23:20,740
Like a fishnet shirt.

3198
02:23:20,740 --> 02:23:22,740
Yeah.

3199
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:24,740
Make it fashionably censored.

3200
02:23:24,740 --> 02:23:26,740
Yeah, okay.

3201
02:23:26,740 --> 02:23:29,740
I forgot that YouTubers like that.

3202
02:23:38,740 --> 02:23:41,740
Do you rip your fishnets off them?

3203
02:23:41,740 --> 02:23:43,740
I don't rip my fishnets.

3204
02:23:43,740 --> 02:23:45,740
I rip my regular...

3205
02:23:45,740 --> 02:23:48,740
I at least find really cheap

3206
02:23:48,740 --> 02:23:51,740
types from Goodwill and I rip those.

3207
02:23:51,740 --> 02:23:53,740
Oh, I see.

3208
02:23:53,740 --> 02:23:56,740
I rip fishnets by accident a lot.

3209
02:23:56,740 --> 02:23:58,740
It's so easy to end up like putting

3210
02:23:58,740 --> 02:24:00,740
thing in the wrong hole.

3211
02:24:00,740 --> 02:24:02,740
Like I put my leg in the wrong hole.

3212
02:24:02,740 --> 02:24:04,740
I'm really stupid. I think I'm too dumb for like,

3213
02:24:04,740 --> 02:24:06,740
nettings.

3214
02:24:06,740 --> 02:24:08,740
There, that's good.

3215
02:24:10,740 --> 02:24:12,740
I don't know if I love it.

3216
02:24:12,740 --> 02:24:14,740
I don't love how it like,

3217
02:24:14,740 --> 02:24:16,740
put the fishnet on.

3218
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:18,740
You don't like it?

3219
02:24:18,740 --> 02:24:20,740
It's censored.

3220
02:24:20,740 --> 02:24:22,740
I probably didn't draw it very well,

3221
02:24:22,740 --> 02:24:24,740
but I can't undo anymore,

3222
02:24:24,740 --> 02:24:26,740
so I guess it's there forever.

3223
02:24:26,740 --> 02:24:28,740
Here we go.

3224
02:24:29,740 --> 02:24:31,740
I'm spying.

3225
02:24:31,740 --> 02:24:33,740
Censorship.

3226
02:24:33,740 --> 02:24:36,740
Fuck YouTube censorship.

3227
02:24:36,740 --> 02:24:38,740
Your line art looks so good.

3228
02:24:38,740 --> 02:24:40,740
How are you so good at lines?

3229
02:24:40,740 --> 02:24:42,740
I know you're a really good artist,

3230
02:24:42,740 --> 02:24:44,740
but damn, your line art is so good,

3231
02:24:44,740 --> 02:24:46,740
and also you're doing it in this fucking program.

3232
02:24:46,740 --> 02:24:48,740
Thank you.

3233
02:24:48,740 --> 02:24:50,740
I'm gonna download the Photoshop file for this

3234
02:24:50,740 --> 02:24:52,740
so that I can continue.

3235
02:24:54,740 --> 02:24:56,740
Wait, it won't let me download the Photoshop file?

3236
02:24:56,740 --> 02:24:58,740
Why can't, how do I do that?

3237
02:24:58,740 --> 02:25:00,740
Oh, X4 as PSD.

3238
02:25:00,740 --> 02:25:02,740
X4 does, yeah.

3239
02:25:02,740 --> 02:25:04,740
You need to fucking sign up for premium

3240
02:25:04,740 --> 02:25:06,740
to have the layers?

3241
02:25:06,740 --> 02:25:08,740
Wait, no, wait, seriously, hold on.

3242
02:25:08,740 --> 02:25:10,740
Let me see if I can open it with the layers.

3243
02:25:10,740 --> 02:25:12,740
Layer images.

3244
02:25:12,740 --> 02:25:14,740
You need to go upgrade the blades to get access.

3245
02:25:16,740 --> 02:25:18,740
There is the free trial.

3246
02:25:18,740 --> 02:25:20,740
Free seven day trial.

3247
02:25:20,740 --> 02:25:22,740
Well, it's so generous.

3248
02:25:24,740 --> 02:25:26,740
Hold on a sec.

3249
02:25:28,740 --> 02:25:30,740
Photoshop.

3250
02:25:30,740 --> 02:25:32,740
No, I have the layers when I download it

3251
02:25:32,740 --> 02:25:34,740
as a Photoshop file, I got the layers.

3252
02:25:34,740 --> 02:25:36,740
Okay, I guess for some reason

3253
02:25:36,740 --> 02:25:38,740
it shows like the red icon

3254
02:25:38,740 --> 02:25:40,740
with the layer images

3255
02:25:40,740 --> 02:25:42,740
that is usually indicative

3256
02:25:42,740 --> 02:25:44,740
of it being a premium feature.

3257
02:25:44,740 --> 02:25:46,740
I'm glad it's not.

3258
02:25:46,740 --> 02:25:48,740
Yeah, that would be fucking sucky.

3259
02:25:50,740 --> 02:25:52,740
Okay, I'm getting really fucking hot

3260
02:25:52,740 --> 02:25:54,740
in my room right now.

3261
02:25:54,740 --> 02:25:56,740
So I'm gonna

3262
02:25:56,740 --> 02:25:58,740
stop there for today.

3263
02:26:02,740 --> 02:26:04,740
I don't know.

3264
02:26:10,740 --> 02:26:12,740
Thank you for joining with me.

3265
02:26:12,740 --> 02:26:14,740
It looks really lovely so far.

3266
02:26:14,740 --> 02:26:16,740
Is this thumbnail worthy?

3267
02:26:16,740 --> 02:26:18,740
It is thumbnail worthy.

3268
02:26:18,740 --> 02:26:20,740
Absolutely, it's thumbnail worthy.

3269
02:26:20,740 --> 02:26:22,740
I don't know.

3270
02:26:22,740 --> 02:26:24,740
I could do more, but at the same time,

3271
02:26:24,740 --> 02:26:26,740
I'm like, not some more.

3272
02:26:26,740 --> 02:26:28,740
I don't know what else to do right now.

3273
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:30,740
It's unworthy.

3274
02:26:30,740 --> 02:26:32,740
It's adorable, it's thumbnail worthy.

3275
02:26:32,740 --> 02:26:34,740
Don't worry about it.

3276
02:26:34,740 --> 02:26:36,740
I really like the pen pal.

3277
02:26:36,740 --> 02:26:38,740
I think he's very cute.

3278
02:26:38,740 --> 02:26:40,740
The pumpkin pal.

3279
02:26:40,740 --> 02:26:42,740
I forgot that I put this on

3280
02:26:42,740 --> 02:26:44,740
because I'm not looking at it there.

3281
02:26:44,740 --> 02:26:46,740
I'm done smoking.

3282
02:26:46,740 --> 02:26:48,740
I'll bring you my tentacles.

3283
02:26:48,740 --> 02:26:50,740
You can put them on yourself.

3284
02:26:50,740 --> 02:26:52,740
You can have tentacles.

3285
02:26:52,740 --> 02:26:54,740
Thank you.

3286
02:26:54,740 --> 02:26:56,740
It's a treat.

3287
02:26:56,740 --> 02:26:58,740
Just a little treat.

3288
02:26:58,740 --> 02:27:00,740
Thank you for joining with me.

3289
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:02,740
Really looking forward to our ASMR together.

3290
02:27:02,740 --> 02:27:04,740
It'll be so good to you.

3291
02:27:04,740 --> 02:27:06,740
To me?

3292
02:27:06,740 --> 02:27:08,740
Or to the viewers?

3293
02:27:08,740 --> 02:27:10,740
I love it. I'd be nice to them.

3294
02:27:10,740 --> 02:27:12,740
I'm going to write you

3295
02:27:12,740 --> 02:27:14,740
as being nice to the viewers in the script.

3296
02:27:18,740 --> 02:27:20,740
You would never.

3297
02:27:20,740 --> 02:27:22,740
You would never?

3298
02:27:22,740 --> 02:27:24,740
You would never.

3299
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:26,740
Well, you're going to have to be nice to them this time.

3300
02:27:26,740 --> 02:27:28,740
Oh my god, you're tentacles

3301
02:27:28,740 --> 02:27:30,740
are tentacling everywhere.

3302
02:27:30,740 --> 02:27:32,740
I'm touching your rotten aliens.

3303
02:27:34,740 --> 02:27:36,740
I'm going to raid Shibi.

3304
02:27:36,740 --> 02:27:38,740
So,

3305
02:27:38,740 --> 02:27:40,740
it'll be nice to Shibi, everyone.

3306
02:27:40,740 --> 02:27:42,740
Yeah, it'll be very nice to her.

3307
02:27:44,740 --> 02:27:46,740
She's doing an ASMR where she's

3308
02:27:46,740 --> 02:27:48,740
doing everyone's makeup.

3309
02:27:48,740 --> 02:27:50,740
They are nice to me.

3310
02:27:50,740 --> 02:27:52,740
Yeah, I love makeup ASMR.

3311
02:27:52,740 --> 02:27:54,740
It's the best kind of ASMR.

3312
02:27:54,740 --> 02:27:56,740
You guys should listen.

3313
02:27:56,740 --> 02:27:58,740
Makeup ASMR is the best.

3314
02:27:58,740 --> 02:28:00,740
It is. It's relaxing.

3315
02:28:02,740 --> 02:28:04,740
Mommy Shibi does your makeup.

3316
02:28:04,740 --> 02:28:06,740
Wait,

3317
02:28:06,740 --> 02:28:08,740
I remember it was like sister Shibi.

3318
02:28:08,740 --> 02:28:10,740
I don't know.

3319
02:28:10,740 --> 02:28:12,740
I think it's Onesan.

3320
02:28:12,740 --> 02:28:14,740
Onesan Shibi.

3321
02:28:14,740 --> 02:28:16,740
Yeah.

3322
02:28:16,740 --> 02:28:18,740
Okay, well, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

3323
02:28:18,740 --> 02:28:20,740
Thank you for coming.

3324
02:28:20,740 --> 02:28:22,740
I'm going to go put it on the

3325
02:28:22,740 --> 02:28:24,740
ending screen now. Bye.

3326
02:28:24,740 --> 02:28:26,740
Bye.

3327
02:28:34,740 --> 02:28:36,740
Let's go.

3328
02:29:04,740 --> 02:29:06,740
Let's go.

3329
02:29:34,740 --> 02:29:36,740
Let's go.
