33:25.800 --> 33:29.480
your alert is one big fart a chain is multiple farts all like a machine gun

33:39.160 --> 33:47.400
the animation is kind of cutely bad at some points

33:49.240 --> 33:52.680
i guess it's just like reminiscent of like older shows

33:55.640 --> 34:01.080
oh shit he's going sickle mode that was cringe i'm sorry

34:01.400 --> 34:13.720

34:14.040 --> 34:16.360
oh

34:26.840 --> 34:28.360
this is a very small village

34:33.960 --> 34:36.360
i wonder how much inbreeding happens here

34:44.360 --> 34:48.360
so

35:02.200 --> 35:07.560
for next for the next watch along let's get a setup where you're sitting on big bro's lap

35:07.720 --> 35:13.400
i i could i guess i could

35:17.080 --> 35:29.400
you want that you don't think you'll get a little distracted

35:29.400 --> 35:43.240
distraction is the point oh but don't you want to watch the show

35:48.680 --> 35:57.240
um thank you for the one dollar your voice even any poking is involuntary

35:59.800 --> 36:05.240
so

36:11.320 --> 36:17.720
i've seen it a million times okay you can do whatever you want but just don't distract me

36:18.600 --> 36:27.240
i want to watch it

36:29.480 --> 36:41.240
again

36:41.640 --> 36:53.080
so

36:57.080 --> 37:05.080
but he did get it right he had fire

37:05.720 --> 37:12.280
i'd rather spend time with those lists you are spending time with me

37:13.800 --> 37:18.920
i would be a firebender

37:24.520 --> 37:34.920
i i do firebend i can't press the toggle right now but i do

37:35.080 --> 37:42.680
he's so real i must finish my roast duck piss bender

37:45.160 --> 37:50.920
shut your trap

37:56.520 --> 38:02.920
i gotta pee

38:05.080 --> 38:16.920
i wish i could raise my hand too

38:35.080 --> 38:42.920
so

38:45.160 --> 38:48.920
bro he's so is his name aang

38:51.000 --> 39:02.920
he's so random equals funny

39:05.320 --> 39:14.920
so

39:19.480 --> 39:20.920
but doesn't she already know

39:25.800 --> 39:26.920
does that mean aang can fly

39:30.520 --> 39:34.920
he matures a lot as the show goes on okay that's good

39:35.240 --> 39:46.920
so

39:47.480 --> 39:58.760
so

40:01.640 --> 40:08.760
i'm sticking my tongue out to lick my fingers

40:08.920 --> 40:12.600
so

40:14.920 --> 40:17.960
the character development this show is top tier for real for real

40:17.960 --> 40:20.600
okay i'll believe you i'll believe you

40:28.680 --> 40:32.600

40:33.560 --> 40:38.920
uh the pain the pain ones are so cute they look like otters

40:45.560 --> 40:48.280
really enjoyed the asmr of it from earlier today really

40:49.960 --> 40:55.720
i'm i'm surprised no it was a cute concept but i personally like doing more um

40:56.040 --> 40:58.440
um seriously asmr's

41:00.600 --> 41:04.040
but everyone was doing a meme one so i was like okay well i gotta do a meme one

41:15.080 --> 41:17.960
i'm surprised didn't end with us passing out and you stealing our kidneys

41:17.960 --> 41:23.000
that's because strawnee wrote it wrote it and not me if i wrote it i would have ended it like that

41:26.520 --> 41:29.560
so

41:34.040 --> 41:38.840
you love losing a hundred dollars in a dark alley you love you do you love losing your kidneys in a

41:38.840 --> 41:51.560
dark alley too and you're pancreas and one of your lungs and your prostate

41:55.880 --> 42:03.560
if it's for me

42:06.520 --> 42:11.560
maybe not the prostate you already said yes though you can't take it back

42:11.560 --> 42:23.400
so

42:25.480 --> 42:37.400
fire nation attack

42:42.520 --> 42:53.400

43:04.120 --> 43:08.760

46:02.520 --> 46:08.520
water earth fire air

46:08.520 --> 46:17.080
long ago the four nations lived together in harmony then everything changed when the fire

46:19.640 --> 46:23.640
only the avatar master of all four elements could stop them

46:24.280 --> 46:29.240
but when the world day had most he vanished a hundred years passed into the

46:38.840 --> 46:42.360
um

46:43.640 --> 46:45.480
is there a world that needs to be saved

46:52.040 --> 46:56.520
i'm calling you now reciting the intro together every time it's going to be a thing

46:56.520 --> 47:05.160
do you want me to do that i can do that big stuff there's a war okay okay

47:09.240 --> 47:17.160
uh-oh

47:22.520 --> 47:26.760
the way he says booby trap is so cute there was this booby trap

47:34.120 --> 47:37.400
you're starting the intro after a few episodes is pretty much a canon event for the show

47:37.400 --> 47:40.120
well it looks like i'm a quick learner because i started reciting it

47:42.280 --> 47:54.040
earlier than a few episodes

48:03.320 --> 48:05.080
i'll stop being an asshole soca

48:07.800 --> 48:11.000
sock on my balls that was a stupid name

48:23.560 --> 48:29.000

48:30.920 --> 48:33.240

it makes him look a little silly i mean he's already kind of silly and he's like 10 to 11

51:45.240 --> 51:48.680
well he was stuck in that iceberg for a long time

51:50.920 --> 51:53.960
oh man ride bitch

54:12.680 --> 54:14.760
i love watching soca get owned

54:19.000 --> 54:21.160

54:21.400 --> 54:26.120

54:30.440 --> 54:30.920

54:31.160 --> 54:33.000

54:45.000 --> 54:47.160
yeah

54:49.560 --> 54:50.840
ain't safe a day

55:00.920 --> 55:05.920
I hope if you get a new outfit you use the old one for any kind of magic streams, it seems fitting.

55:05.920 --> 55:08.920
I'll still use the old one sometimes too.

55:08.920 --> 55:11.920
Of course, I still think it's cute.

55:14.920 --> 55:17.920
You're the avatar?

55:18.920 --> 55:20.920
No way.

55:22.920 --> 55:27.920
Are you gonna watch the whole show with us eventually or is it just watching as far as we can today and that's it?

55:28.920 --> 55:32.920
I feel like I should watch the whole show, right?

55:35.920 --> 55:39.920
I just don't know if people would want to watch the whole thing with me.

55:39.920 --> 55:43.920
It might be a little boring because it's such a long show, right?

55:46.920 --> 55:52.920
Would you let me watch some episodes alone or do you want to watch everything with me?

55:53.920 --> 55:58.920
Continue if you want to, that would be a fun to watch, watching it together.

55:59.920 --> 56:02.920
I'll watch anything you want to watch?

56:03.920 --> 56:06.920
Movie day stream? I can't stream all day.

56:06.920 --> 56:09.920
Not today at least.

56:13.920 --> 56:15.920
I'm not sure.

56:16.920 --> 56:18.920
I'm not sure.

56:18.920 --> 56:22.920
I don't want to watch it if people don't want to watch it, you know?

56:23.920 --> 56:26.920
I'll watch it all with you, really?

56:30.920 --> 56:33.920
We can pick up where you left off.

56:34.920 --> 56:36.920
I'd be down and I'd be down.

56:36.920 --> 56:38.920
I'd stick around.

56:38.920 --> 56:40.920
Okay, okay.

56:41.920 --> 56:43.920
I'd like to see...

56:43.920 --> 56:47.920
I'd like some reactions to cut up footage at some point, though.

56:48.920 --> 56:51.920
Some reactions to cut up footage?

56:53.920 --> 56:59.920
Like clips where I show what I'm reacting to, is that what you mean?

57:10.920 --> 57:13.920
If you don't like the series, then no one is having fun.

57:13.920 --> 57:15.920
I have no problem with this so far.

57:15.920 --> 57:22.920
I just don't want people to be bored by me doing come often.

57:22.920 --> 57:25.920
Frequent watch-alongs, you know?

57:31.920 --> 57:33.920
Maybe members only?

57:33.920 --> 57:35.920
I don't know.

57:35.920 --> 57:39.920
I feel like that's a dick move to put it behind a paywall, though.

57:40.920 --> 57:42.920
Haha.

57:43.920 --> 57:46.920
I feel bad for putting anything behind a paywall.

57:49.920 --> 57:51.920
Wouldn't ever be bored?

57:51.920 --> 57:53.920
Okay, if you want to.

57:57.920 --> 57:59.920
Could be every two weeks.

57:59.920 --> 58:04.920
It would be a really, really slow progress to finish the show

58:04.920 --> 58:07.920
if I just watch a little bit every two weeks, right?

58:08.920 --> 58:10.920
You know...

58:12.920 --> 58:15.920
It would take forever to finish it.

58:23.920 --> 58:29.920
Fatherless, fatherless, sad, fatherless child.

58:30.920 --> 58:32.920
A little orphaned boy.

58:32.920 --> 58:35.920
I suppose you wouldn't know about fathers.

58:38.920 --> 58:43.920
We can fix your Zoomer brain rot once we run out of time?

58:43.920 --> 58:47.920
But how would this show fix my Zoomer brain rot?

58:52.920 --> 58:59.920
Oh my god, I'm literally so hot I can feel myself dripping sweat on the sides of my body.

59:01.920 --> 59:03.920
Oh shit, I'm looking to gooo!

59:08.920 --> 59:10.920
Dripping.

59:14.920 --> 59:16.920
The avatar just escaped!

59:17.920 --> 59:20.920
Hot? Really? Take some clothes off?

59:20.920 --> 59:23.920
I'm not wearing anything underneath, though.

59:23.920 --> 59:26.920
I don't really like being naked.

59:31.920 --> 59:35.920
I'm not overdressed. I'm just wearing pajamas.

59:35.920 --> 59:37.920
Hot.

59:44.920 --> 59:47.920
You just want me to get naked.

59:55.920 --> 59:57.920
Yep yep.

59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.920
It's flying!

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.920
Haha.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.920
We got the piss, now we need the sweat.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.920
Now we need the sweat?

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.920
Chat, do you think?

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.920
You didn't get no...

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:29.920
Yeah, you got a little bit of piss, but what am I supposed to do with sweat?

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:35.920
Sweatbending is canonically a thing in this show, so it's kind of fitting.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:39.920
I guess sweat is water, so yeah.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.920
Ah, look at him sleeping like a little baby.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:03.920
You know, non-live videos will always see what you're reacting to in the corner.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.920
Cut up to a boring sort of thing.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.920
If you can't, that's fine.

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.920
If you can, that's fine.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.920
Non-live videos.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.920
Non-live.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.920
The only thing I can think of, I mean, thank you for the five dollars, Dan,

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:21.920
but the only thing I can think of is clips where I cut up my reaction

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:27.920
and then, like, edit in the show, the part of the show that I'm reacting to.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.920
Oh, TTS, it's still audible? Oh, I'm sorry.

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.920
Here.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.920
I muted it.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.920
It's not audible to me, I can't hear it myself.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.920
Sorry, sorry, sorry, I turned it off, I turned it off now.

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.920
Oh, shh, get shot on, Zuko.

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.920
How do they know that he's the avatar?

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.920
Is it just because he's got arrows?

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.920
Good girl.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:00.920
Ah!

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:01.920
Ah!

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:02.920
Ah!

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.920
How do they know that he's the avatar?

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:07.920
Is it just because he's got arrows?

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.920
Good girl.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:09.920
Ah!

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.920
Thank you.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.920
He's an air banger, he's bald.

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.920
You'll find out.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.920
Okay, all those are different answers.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.920
Oh, no.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:34.920
They'll explain?

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:35.920
Well, he's the last air bender.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.920
Well, with that, I don't get it.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.920
Like, he's the last one, yeah.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.920
But why does that make him the avatar?

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.920
Because he's an air bender.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.920
Bald power!

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.920
Oh, the arrows are distinctly air bender.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.920
Oh, okay.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.920
You'll find out.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.920
Can you just fly away?

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.920
What are you doing? Just fly away.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.920
Oh my god, this is when he gets awakened, right?

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.920
He had a dream about this.

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.920
He learned how to water bend!

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.920
Yo!

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:35.920
Look at him go!

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.920
Can't fly without his staff, oh.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.920
The dream was how he got in the iceberg?

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.920
Oh.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.920
Oh!

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.920
Jump scare!

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.920
They like break up serious moments in the air.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.920

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.560

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.560
He did it pretty good.

Yes, I don't know what there are.

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.880
I need to go get my scissors, hold on.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.880
I got two packages from you guys, I'm guessing.

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.880
Okay, let's open the first one.

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.880
Yeah, I said package.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:07.880
Definitely lobotomy toys?

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.880
I'm not lobotomizing anyone.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.880
Is it the bear? No.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.880
I thought it was.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.880
I thought it was going to be that.

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:20.880
Because it seemed like it would be.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.880
But it's not.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.880
I'm not actually sure.

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.880
I'm not actually sure what it is.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.880
What is this?

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:33.880
Is it a rabbit? No.

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.880
Open.

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.880
What is this?

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.880
I have so many packages.

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.880
I'll thank you for becoming a pinpal jeery fish.

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.880
Is it from Throne? I'm guessing.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:54.880
I've had so many packages lately though.

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.880
Wait, what is this?

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:03.880
But I don't really remember any of them.

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:09.880
I think it's my shock collar.

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.880
Oh my god, it's the shock collar.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.880
I kind of want to try it out.

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:21.880
I want to try it.

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:27.880
Let's give it a quick test.

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.880
I want to test it so bad.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.880
Doesn't need a charge?

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.880
You're right, I don't know.

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:44.880
Let's open this box.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.880
It's so cute.

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.880
It's really stylish.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.880
It's like a...

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.880
Oh god, I'm so scared.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.880
Is it heavy?

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:58.880
No, not at all.

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:00.880
It's really light.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.880
Let me see the instructions.

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.880
One of the devices down

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.880
unable to press the reset button.

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.880
The instructions will color it.

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:18.880
It's just black.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.880
You can look on Throne if you want to know what it looks like.

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.880
I'm very confused on how this works.

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.880
The instructions are really badly translated.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.880
When the device is down

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.880
and unable to operate, please press

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.880
the reset button to restart the device

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.880
in order to reset it.

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:40.880
There's only one button here and it doesn't make sense.

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:44.880
Did I do it?

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.880
Maybe it's dead.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.880
Oh, there's an app!

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.880
Is there an app?

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.880
There is an app.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.880
Press the padlock beam.

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.880
Oh my god, to lock it.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.880
Oh my god.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.880
Have you tried turning it on and off again?

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.880
Device online charging status.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.880
They have a bunch of pictures in the instructions

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.880
where it says

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.880
there's a picture of the Hulk throwing the color

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.880
and it's like, do not throw.

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.880
And then there's a guy wearing it while running

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.880
and I'm guessing don't wear it while you're exercising.

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.880
There's another guy.

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:42.880
These pictures are so funny.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.880
I wish I could show you.

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.880
Imagine if Pimpel is at control of it.

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.880
That's the goal, baby.

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.880
That's the fucking goal.

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.880
Oh my god.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.880
Guys.

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:56.880
It comes with a lock.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.880
It comes with a lock and a key.

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.880
Just take a photo and show us.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.880
I will. After stream, I'll take a photo.

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.880
It comes with a lock and a key.

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.880
That's so fucking crazy.

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.880
Put it on.

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.880
I don't think it works.

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.880
I have to charge it.

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:20.880
I'm guessing.

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.880
I'm going to plug it in right now.

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.880
The gears are turning.

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.880
The gears are turning.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.880
The gears are turning.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.880
Let me plug it in.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.880
Okay.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.880
The next thing.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.880
I also don't know what it is.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.880
I have a feeling I know what it is, but I'm not sure.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.880
If we can't control it directly, how about you do it manually

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.880
as in we give you a don't know and you activate it yourself?

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.880
Yeah.

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.880
Yeah, that works too.

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.880
Here, let me see.

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.880
Little devil.

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.880
Little devil.

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.880
Let me go on my phone to see if I can find the app.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.880
Let me go on my phone to see if I can find the app.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.880
Little devil.

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.880
That's such a strange name.

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.880
Because it shows that there's an app.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.880
Maybe I shouldn't try to figure this out now.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.880
The Bluetooth

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.880
After you

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.880
turn on the crawling mode.

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:06.880
Oh, this is really badly translated.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:08.880
Bluetooth and crawling mode.

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.880
I know Shibi also got this shock color,

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.880
so maybe why would you get a shock color

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:14.880
if you have no one to shock you?

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.880
Doesn't seem fun to shock yourself.

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.880
It doesn't seem fun to shock yourself.

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.880
Get out of my chat.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.880
You don't know me.

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.880
Um.

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.880
Players.

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.880
So this is a new dongle

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:40.880
on an endurance stream, right?

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:42.880
Like

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.880
like shock me?

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:54.880
I wish I had like a QR code

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:56.880
for me to download the app

01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.880
because I can't seem to find it anywhere.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.880
Okay, whatever.

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.880
I'll open another.

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:06.880
I'll open the other thing now.

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:10.880

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.880
Queen app.

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:14.880
Oh, for the app.

I found it.

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:32.880
Okay.

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.880
Oh, the other thing is my blanket.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.880
It's just in my mushroom blanket.

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.880
Okay, that's nice.

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.880
Thank you.

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.880

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.880
Yeah, that's the point.

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.880

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.880

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:34.880
that's an interesting feeling

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:36.880
i wonder how shevi would feel about that

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:38.880
how'd it go

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:40.880
um

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.880
she came

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.880
oh god

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:50.880
it's like um

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.880
it's like

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.880
it's like multiple shocks

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:56.880
in a row the first one was really intense

01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.880
and then it was um

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:00.880
then it was like multiple small ones

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.880
after that

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:04.880
here let me try the different settings

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:06.880
let's do

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.880
okay so that was firm

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:10.880
let me try soft

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:16.880
that was not as soft

01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:18.880
that was not any softer

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.880
it keeps scaring me

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.880
because like oh my god

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:24.880
it keeps scaring me

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:26.880
that was not any softer

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:28.880
oh my god

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.880
it keeps scaring me every time i do it

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.880
i'll have to get used to it

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.880
okay okay let's try

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:36.880
oh i'm scared

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.880
i don't want to do it

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.880
i don't want to do it i'm scared

01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:46.880
big brother got delayed by a work

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:48.880
i'm sorry for missing the stream

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:50.880
it's okay it's okay you came in at a good time

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.880
okay

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.880
you can do it

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:56.880
will you do a getting used to a membership stream

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:00.880
i could

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:02.880
is it safe to really shock yourself that often

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:04.880
it feels like um

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.880
like uh

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.880
like those shocks from like

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.880
what's it called

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:12.880
like those static shocks

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.880
it feels like static shocks

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:16.880
but it's all around

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:18.880
it's all around by neck

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.880
mostly in the front

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:22.880
i'm gonna drink some water

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:28.880
okay

01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:30.880
so i tried soft i tried firm

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.880
so now there's tremor and then there's passion

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:34.880
those are the next two settings

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:36.880
that are left

01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:38.880
i'll try not to scream

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.880
does it come with safety instructions yeah i said don't wear it while you're exercising

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.880
i am

01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.880
really sweaty

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.880
i don't know

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:48.880
okay i'm gonna do

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:50.880
i'm scared

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:52.880
i'm scared

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.880
i'm gonna do tremor

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.880
oh god oh god

01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:58.880
i have to press the button myself

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.880
oh fuck okay

01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:02.880
no tremor seems like a lost

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.880
i'm scared okay sorry

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:06.880
um

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.880
what did i do before i did soft and

01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:10.880
and firm let's try passion

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.880
oh my god

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.880
they all kind of feel the same

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:24.880
they all kind of feel the same

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.880
i don't know i don't notice the difference

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:32.880
between these different modes

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:40.880
okay okay i'll try the last um

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:42.880
um

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.880
i guess you need to turn it up

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:46.880
it's already really intense

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:50.880
it's already really intense

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:54.880
i'll try the last one so the last one is tremor

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.880
trem scares me

01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:58.880
goodbye vod is it really gonna get

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.880
i'm just

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:02.880
nah

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:04.880
we have some gaps between the morning

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:06.880
it's okay

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:08.880
maybe doing them enough times

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:10.880
they feel the same

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:12.880
i don't know

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.880
i feel like okay tremor

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:16.880
i'm scared tremor sounds really bad

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:18.880
okay don't be scared don't be scared don't be scared

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:22.880
wait that was nothing compared

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.880
to the last one

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:32.880
okay well i'm done

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.880
i'm done

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.880
oh my god

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.880
for some reason like

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:52.880
every time it shocks me

01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:54.880
it makes me raise my shoulders

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.880
like

01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:58.880
without me um

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:00.880
like wanting to it

01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:02.880
like forces me to raise my shoulder

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:06.880
try again

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:08.880
can you find a way for chat to trigger this

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:12.880
am i allowed to do that on youtube though

01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:16.880
like i feel like i

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:18.880
i feel like i shouldn't be allowed to do that on youtube

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:24.880
another one

01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:39.880
you're nervous impulses that control them

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.880
normally are also electrical signals

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:46.880
you can try on twitch

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:48.880
i don't think we'll be streaming on twitch at all

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.880
another patch

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:52.880
i think the only thing you might

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:54.880
be reported for is self harm

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.880
it's not self harm

01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:58.880
it's like the opposite of self harm

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:02.880
just one more

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:04.880
okay

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:06.880
i just unbuckled it somehow

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:08.880
come on

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.880
okay

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:16.880
this is the most fun

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:18.880
watch along i've seen

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:20.880
thank you for the eight dollars

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:24.880
strani was planning

01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:26.880
on wearing hers for the elden rink stream

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:28.880
maybe ask her about what the rules are

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:30.880
okay but like if she says

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:32.880
like oh just don't really moan

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:34.880
don't try to make it sexually sound

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:36.880
i can't

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:38.880
dude

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.880
maybe behind members

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.880
maybe behind members i will

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:44.880
i feel like i have to make it a little

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:46.880
behind members streams

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:48.880
i hope i'm scared

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:50.880
i don't want to like die from this

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:52.880
it's like really intense

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:56.880
this is like really intense

01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.880
okay

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:00.880
then just scream

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.880
i don't want to annoy my neighbors that much

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:04.880
you want one more passion

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:06.880
i'm scared

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:10.880
it like i sort of got it like throb sometimes

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:12.880
and it makes me scared

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:14.880
okay

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:16.880
passion

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:18.880
i'm scared okay

01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.880

okay

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:30.880
oh god my freaking lines

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:32.880
are so annoying

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:36.880
i want to leave that to charge

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:48.880
okay

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:50.880
come on

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.880
okay

01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:54.880
you broke

01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.880
you broke

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:02.880
how do i

01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:04.880
shit

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:10.880
do i have to restart the episode

01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:12.880
you did so good

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:16.880
thank you

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:18.880
it's scary to have it done myself

01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:20.880
i don't like being controlled

01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:22.880
i don't like being controlled

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:24.880
in control of it

01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.880
we didn't get very far

01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:30.880
should i just restart the episode

01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:36.880
or should i wait until the

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:38.880
stupid stopwatch

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:40.880
not stopwatch but timer

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:42.880
gets back to the time i was at

01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:46.880
we'll take control next time

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.880
i hope so

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:50.880
thanks for blessing us

01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:58.880
i paused at

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.880
327 it says

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.880
oh yeah i sorry

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:04.880
i paused the timer for something

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.880
but i actually paused the show itself at 327

01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:12.880
it was only a few minutes

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:14.880
okay we can restart

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:20.880
that was a perfect break

01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:30.880
okay

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:34.880
okay let me go get more water

01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.880
oh my god

01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:38.880
that was intense

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:50.880
okay

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:52.880
okay

01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:54.880
okay

01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:56.880
okay

01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:58.880
okay

01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:00.880

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:06.880
okay

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:08.880

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:10.880

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.880
calm down

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.880
calm down

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.880
it's in the title

01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.880
it's in the title

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:49.880
avatar the last airbender

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:52.880
episode 3 season 1

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:53.880
okay

01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:57.880
I think Amy will have some PTSD every time Zuko or Azura

01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:00.880
Azula lightning bends

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.880
will I?

01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:04.880
it's okay

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:06.880
it's not, I don't know

01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:11.880
I've never been shocked before so I guess I don't really know how to describe it

01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:13.880
other than like

01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:15.880
static

01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:17.880
okay ready?

01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:18.880
one

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:20.880
two

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.880
three

01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:25.880
okay

01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.880
did you like it?

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:35.880
yes

01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:37.880
yes

01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:39.880
of course I liked it

01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:41.880
why else would I get a shock?

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:49.880
only the avatar master hold four elements

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:53.880
he vanished

01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:55.880
100 years passed

01:40:55.880 --> 01:41:00.880
and my brother and I discovered the new avatar an airbender named Aang

01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:04.880
I hope we could use it on you too

01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:07.880
I'll try to set that up for you

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.880
yes

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:19.880
Aang can save the world

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:28.880
why do I feel like Amy didn't take it off?

01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:30.880
I did

01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:33.880
I did

01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:45.880
she's fried

01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:47.880
I got cooked

01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:50.880
the electricians cooked me alive

01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.880
you're terrible here we come

01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:01.880
I got shocked by faulty wiring before so let me say wasn't a fan

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:03.880
yeah

01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:05.880
I'm sure

01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:10.880
I'm sure too much is really painful of course

01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:15.880
you okay?

01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:17.880
yeah

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:19.880
don't worry about me

01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:21.880
I did it to myself

01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:23.880
if I didn't want to do it I wouldn't have done it

01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:25.880
are you an aftercloth?

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:27.880
kind of

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:33.880
I want to do it more but that's not the point of this stream so I'm going to hold myself back

01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:35.880
okay

01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:37.880
okay

01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:42.880
I want to do it more but that's not the point of this stream so I'm going to hold myself back

01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:52.880
what brings you to my harbor?

01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:58.880
this

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:03.880
sounds like you need some alone time after stream

01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:06.880
no I have other work to do

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:13.880
I have so much stuff to do because I have to pre-record stuff because I'm going on vacation soon

01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:16.880
I can't

01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:27.880

01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:05.880
I'm just doing the shower

01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:07.880
I guess I could

01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:11.880
I don't know I feel like it's not that comfortable in the shower

01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:13.880
and also I can't stand

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:15.880
and I don't want to lay down in the shower

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:31.880
damn he's in denial

01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:33.880
that his kind is all dead

01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:43.880
there's there's been an air bender genocide

01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:49.880
quick someone invent the shower bed

01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:54.880
I guess there's like chairs for showers but those are for old people

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.880
ooh

01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:18.880

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:20.880
yes yes yes I can

01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:26.880
I don't know how much because I'll be doing things on vacation

01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:28.880

01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:07.880

01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:39.880
I don't like that excitement

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.880
that's not for me

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:43.880

01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:06.880

I'll still post twitter audios

01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:35.880
