Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
Oh wait. Oh shit, my model turned off! Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. That wasn't supposed to happen. You're muted on my stream, too. Hold on, hold on.
Uh, application audio capture, discord call. Okay, say something?
Stop party people. Okay. Hi. Hello. Okay. Hi. Let me connect my model again. Oh shit, my phone. Okay.
Hello. Apologies for the scoff. It was working before stream. It was. We even started early just in case, or we hopped on call early. Yeah.
Hey, well. Oh, I just realized audio is bad. Okay, let me turn that down a little bit. Is audio okay on my side? Your audio's fine. Yeah, is my audio okay?
Is the background music to voice ratio to Emmy ratio okay? Yeah, is it okay? Audio's fine? Come on, chat on my side. You gotta step it up. You gotta step it up.
We should tell them. Okay, we're both streaming on YouTube. So if you want to see the other person's perspective, because this is a two person perspective game, then you should go to the other person's stream too.
Um, I think I have you in the, in my, um, description. In my title, I should. Oh, yeah, yeah, me too, me too. So guys, yeah, click on that. Oh, like, go check out the other person too. Yes. Yeah, you're in my, why is my bottle lagging? Oh, yeah. Okay, okay.
Okay, thanks guys. Thanks for stepping up. Okay. Yeah, like you said, this is a tool, tool perspective thing. So I also have Emmy socials in the description of my stream, but you can also click the little at thing in the title, whatever you want.
Open it on two screens. Do will this shit. If you don't have two screens, open one on your phone and one on your computer, unless you broke, which I'm sorry.
Yeah, open them both up and watch them both. Okay. Okay. Are we ready to, oh wait, wait, wait, one more, one more announcement. The stream will only be one hour long because I'm going through a heat wave and I'm fucking hot in here. Yeah.
Yeah. Yes. Send some ice cream funds to me, please.
Don't do that. AC funds, let's go. We need to upgrade her to a new apartment, guys. We gotta step up.
No, it's okay. It's okay. Okay. Okay. Let's, let's, let's do this. Okay.
Okay. Do you want to diffuse first or do you want to give instructions first?
I'll give instructions first.
Okay.
All right. Okay. So Emmy and I did play a little bit of this upstream so you can see a little bit of check marks and everything. We kind of skip to point two and point three because we were like, easy money.
This is easy. So let's start at 3.1. Let's not even do the other two because we beat the last one in the level of self. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay. So this is five minutes, three minutes, three seconds. I'm so excited.
Oh, why is my model frozen? Oh, okay. I think my Wi-Fi is being a little shitty. So, Mubby, if the shit is wrong. Okay.
Okay. So we have, let's start with Simon Says because we did Simon Says before.
Simon Says. Yes. Okay. Got it.
Okay. Okay. Yellow blink. It's blinking yellow. One time.
We've never done Simon Says. We've never done Simon Says. No, we've never done Simon Says.
Okay. Okay. Wires. Wires. Wires.
So I have, are you there at Wires? Yes. Wires. Okay. Okay. So I have white, blue, white, and that's the only three I have. So there's three.
Okay. Cut the second wire. Boom. Noise. Okay. Simon Says.
Blinking yellow. Are you control f-ing? Yes. That's exactly what you did. Yeah, that is the smart way to do it.
One of the four colored buttons will flash using the correct table below. Press the button with the corresponding color. The original button will flash.
Okay. Sorry. I shouldn't read it. I don't get it.
So, so. Oh, fuck. I can't remember what it looks like now. Um, if it's blink, I think it's corresponded to the thing. I don't know. You can figure it out.
Okay. Well, the right button. You said it flash yellow. Yes. Yes. Well, for me, the yellow one is the right, the button on the right.
Yes. So it, oh shit. Fuck. Fuck. I'm wrong. Press the button with the corresponding color.
Yeah. So if I have yellow, then that means it's something on your side.
Green. Green. Fuck. Oh, it's a yellow and then green. Oh, no. Okay. Um, that's two strikes.
One more. Okay. Blue. Blue. Fuck. We did. Oh, I don't get it. Oh, wait. It's the serial. Oh, we were supposed to look at the serial number two.
Oh, shit. Okay. Okay. It's okay. We can retry. We can retry. That was just a practice run. We were just practicing warm up. Yeah, that was just a warm up.
Okay. Um, oh shit. I don't have Simon Says anymore. Okay. I have the button, the button. We've done that one before. It's a white button. This is whole.
Um, hold the button. Okay. Hold the button. Okay. There's a red strip.
Um, release when the countdown timer has a one in any position. Boom, baby. Okay. Okay. This is the word one. This is the one that looks like a calculator.
Remember that one? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So the word on the screen is you are spelled Y O U space A R E.
Y O U. Uh, bottom right. Bottom right. Nope. Nope. Okay. Now it is the word you are.
Remember, you have to look at step two as well.
Oh, wait, you like you and are you the letters you and are. Yes.
Okay. Um, top.
Okay.
Sure.
Okay. Okay. Now, now it's the word first.
It's the word first. And then let me know.
Oh, I think you have to ask me what like so so if it's the word first, then I have to tell you what what word it is in that eyeball location.
Okay. Okay. Okay. So what's the eyeball location? Top right. Top right is the word. Uh, so a U H H H. So now you have to go to step two.
Uh, ready? Nothing left. What? Okay. Yes. Right. No. Okay. Nice. Nice. Okay. Okay. We're getting it.
We're getting it. Now it's the word C C E E.
Um, okay. Bottom, bottom, bottom right.
Bottom right is the word nothing.
Okay. Uh, U H H H. Right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Cool. Okay. Next. Read R E A D.
Uh, middle, middle right.
Middle right is the word wait.
Uh, U H H H. No blank.
Okay. Nice. Noice. Noice. Noice. Okay. We just have one more. Fuck. I don't know what this thing's called either. It's like there's five. Fuck. Shut up snooze. Okay. Shut up. Okay. Okay.
So there's a five letters and then up arrow down arrow per letter. I think we're supposed to spell a word or something.
Five letters.
Oh, one, two, three, four, five. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I found it. Passwords. Okay. Cool. Okay. The button above and below each letter.
We're so I can do the possible only one time.
Oh, that's a lot of you, but we have 40 seconds.
Only one combination of the available letters.
Is there a word?
Uh, U G M U B is what I see right now.
Oh.
Can you press up or down and see what it says?
Yeah. Um, so, so the first column is the letters D T G Q U column.
So, so, you know how there's like four, there's five letters, right? So when I cycle through the first, oh shit, I'm dead. Okay.
Damn it.
It's okay. It's okay. We had that puzzle on the other one as well. So let's let's try to do that one first.
Then okay, I'm going to retry one more time. If you can't get this one, you want to switch perspectives? Yes. Yes.
Stupid rain downstream. I feel like we're doing 10 times worse.
It's okay. It's okay. It's the heat. It's melting your brain. Okay. Let's do passwords first. Um, so, okay. So there's five letters, right?
And the up arrows, I can cycle through each one of the letters. So the first letter in the five letter sequence has such and such letters.
Does that make sense? Okay. Do you want me to tell you what the letters are?
Or okay. So the first, the first letter in the sequence is J N D G Y T. Those are the first sequence of letters.
Okay. And then you might need a pen and paper.
I don't know. Um, so the next sequence is Y H A D J B. Okay.
And then the third sequence, because I think you're supposed to make a word out of like all of the letters.
So you're going to have to be super big brain for this. Okay. Three is J A Z F R C.
Okay. And then let me know if I'm going too fast. And then four is C K W R E I. Okay.
And then the last sequence is L E M A I O.
Okay. You're like confident.
I'm going to tell you to spell a random word and I don't think it's going to work. Can you spell the word?
Spell which? W H I C H.
You cannot spell that word, girl. You can't. You can't have the letters.
Okay. So the first, okay. Maybe the first sequence of letters will be able to help you determine which word it is.
Yeah, say it again. Say it again. I think I understand that. Say it again.
Okay. Cool. So it's J N D G Y T.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
What's the next one? What's the next one? I get it. I understand now.
Okay. Okay. D J B Y H A.
Okay. Okay. What's the next one?
Okay. J A Z F R C.
Okay. Spell three.
Three. Three. Three. Three.
Oh my God. You're so smart.
Okay. What's the next one?
Okay. Okay. Okay. Simon says. Simon says.
You got this. You got this.
I didn't understand this one either. One of the four color buttons will flash using the correct table.
We'll press the button with the corresponding color.
Okay. Which one is flashing?
Blue.
Okay. Does the zero number contain a vowel?
Uh, er, er, yes.
Okay. Um, press the red one.
Red. Oh! Oh!
Okay. Okay. Now it's blue, red. Blue, red.
Blue, red.
What do I do now?
What do I do now? Blue, red?
Okay. Blue, red.
Um, try red?
Red and then...
Red and then...
And then, and then what?
Red, red? No, that's wrong!
Wait, I didn't understand this one either!
So, so, so the sequence on my side is...
Well, you got the first one, so you're one step closer.
So the sequence on my side is blue, red.
Okay. Blue, red. Okay. So try...
Try red and then blue?
Red. Oh!
I accidentally hit something.
I accidentally hit green and it didn't give me a fucking thing.
Oh, shit. Okay. Hold on.
Red. Oh, it's not red anymore!
It's not red anymore!
I think, I think after we get one strike,
it might affect the side of the screen.
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Green, yellow.
Okay. I have two strikes now. I have two strikes now.
Oh, red, red, green.
Red, green. Oh, pug. Okay.
Blue, red, yellow. Blue, red, yellow.
Okay. Red, green, blue.
Red, green, blue.
Oh my god.
We're figuring it out. We're figuring it out.
Blue, red, fucking yellow is the last one.
So blue, red, yellow, green? Or no?
Oh, I died.
Oh, we're so close!
Really? Are we actually close?
Because, because after Simon says it's the button
and then the button's so fucking easy.
Okay. That's okay.
Okay.
Cool. So now, everybody look at,
look at Amy's perspective.
We're gonna switch.
We're gonna switch sides.
Yes.

it's just like so the morse code is saying a word and you're supposed to tell me like all of the
morse code and I'm supposed to put like like each each code is for like one letter and I have to put
the letters together together to make a word and then oh shit and then when I find the word I have
to tell you which frequency to make it I think god damn that's difficult I mean that's the
point of the game right that's true okay okay let's try over to that let's let's go again okay okay

and then the black wire is connected to the three and it's also connected to the b
fuck me okay um oh I get it I get it okay so so it's one b is the red right
yes yes okay what's the black one three b three b oh nice uh cut if connected to b yeah cut the
third black wire connected to b okay now okay now what's on your screen the same thing oh oh oh oh
you need a you need a press an arrow I think oh which one
upper down cut the wire to the direction I don't know click down maybe
okay okay okay okay so now I have um four five six on the left and then abc on the right
so um four is connected to four is a blue wire and it's connected to a five is a red
cut that one oh cut no what for a yeah it was a blue wire oh I think you have to start from
from one to one down okay start start from one
start from one there's no one there's no one okay then they go to the next it's the first one four
it's four five six oh fuck oh shit my nuts oh my goodness okay what's the next one okay five is a
red wire connected to a and then six is a black wire connected to c and I have 30 seconds left
red wire that's connected to c cut if connected to a or c so cut the red wire
you just made me die okay I think what the issue is I think on the first panel I had to tell you
everything I thought we just need to cut one wire but no I think we have to cut every single one
and then we can move on to the next panel I think I didn't quite get it but it's okay
press retry oh okay that's okay then do over time I hope you get this again I want to
try to decode it oh there's two sides of this oh fuck me okay okay so let's start with the wires
there's three wires two black and one blue two black one blue two black one blue two black one blue
sorry I'm scrolling two black one blue ah that's the wrong fucking thing three wires two black one
three wires two black one blue
cut the last water a white wire no oh shit if there's no red wires cut the second wire might be
okay I can't read okay okay okay it's okay um let's start with Simon says again um it's green
and we have one we have one strike vowel wait vowel oh vowel vowel um vowel vowel is a is a vowel
yes okay yes one strike vowel what color green green yellow hit yellow oh sorry blue
fuck me okay a yellow hit yellow I didn't blue it it made me explode oh shit might be
hold on one more time one more time let me redo myself you want to try one more time
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah whatever I need myself okay okay okay I can't see anything oh what is this
okay wires again um one two three five wires two black one white one red and one blue
okay uh one red mm-hmm is there more than one yellow there's no yellow
fuck uh you have a black cut the first wire okay um okay Simon says again um okay there's no strikes
right no strikes no vowels and right now it's flashing um red blue hit blue okay um okay red red
blue blue
red red yellow blue blue red
okay
excuse me okay so now we have wires again this time they run um
vertical vertical they run vertical so there's a no it's not the same one as before
I know it's complicated wires there's a fucking bend diagram
okay hold on hell fuck I need a I might need a pull out pencil and paper for this shit
okay it's okay we still have three minutes you got this you got this okay um stop calling me I'm mine
I'm mine so there's four wires okay are there like stars at the bottom and everything and
then lights at the top there's lights at the top but there's no stars okay no stars oh hold on let me
look at the okay okay all right so all the leds are on no
there's okay you're gonna have to be so fucking specific with this shit okay I'll describe it all
is that okay yeah yeah okay let me turn my game volume down it's so loud right now Jesus Christ
shut up okay so there's a red wire okay that's the first one and then there's a space and then
there's another red wire and then there's a blue wire and then there's a white wire and then it's
blank again okay okay and then at the top okay hold on do it like this say light color and then
there's no stars at all right so just say the whether it has a light and then what color the
wire is okay red with light red with no light blue hold on go slow down slow down okay okay red with
light um okay red with light and then the next one red with no light red with no light red with no
light red with no light red with no light what the fuck red with no light okay okay blue with light
blue with light okay okay next one okay okay white with no light white with no light
okay god it's just like fucking math class all over again aren't you good at math no i hated this type
of math fucking algebra miss me with that shit okay um cut the wire if the last digit of the serial
number is even do not cut the wire okay don't cut the wire that has red and light don't cut that one
okay um the last digit of the serial number is eight okay so i think if it's red and blue but
it's not red and blue fuck oh my god there's only 45 seconds left oh fuck i'm an idiot okay okay hold
on hold on hold on hold on so so so if it's red with light uh cut the wire if the bomb has two or
more batteries it has two or more batteries yes okay cut that one the red with the red light yeah
okay okay okay okay what's the next one again red with no light red with no light is s um s s s
cut the wire if the last digit of the serial number is even so cut yes cut that one okay okay okay
cut the wire if the bomb has a parallel port what the fuck there's a parallel port
oh my god i got at the last moment oh my god it made sense in my brain at the last moment okay
so what i thought it was okay so there's like multiple venn diagrams crossing each other right
i thought it was like math where you have to like put it like factor in all of the variables
and you only look at the area that's inside of like all of the variables but variables together
but that's not how that works you only look at two variables or more okay okay okay okay okay
you want to switch yes we can switch okay do you want to do that level yes okay yes i want you to
listen i want suffering with you i know my suffering i was there the whole time i've been suffering
okay whatever you're ready i'm ready right now okay dogs let me open
i'll drink with you yeah
cheers
that's what it is in japanese okay um i see the venn diagram one let's just start with wires
it is six wires two white one yellow three yellow one blue
not in that order by the way not in that order two white three yellow there's no red okay a
cut the last wire cut the last wire pug okay uh the numbers the numbers on the screen the number on
the screen okay what's the display four um press the button in the fourth position four that's
number four okay and then four press the button in the same position as you press in stage one
so fourth earth position yeah that's number one okay three um
which stage are we in third um press the button in the third position that's the number four
then three um press the button in the same position as you press in stage two
that's the second position or the first position fuck first position fuck no okay uh
no we have to start all over again okay two it's the number two press the button in the second
position four okay second position two this is number two press the button in the same
position as you press in stage one that's second position yeah is it okay okay yes uh one press
the button the same label you pressed s is in stage two four okay that was in the second position
two press the button in the first position that's the number two
three press the button with the same label as you pressed in stage four so two two oh good
thank you remember it okay okay all right um the last one is the one with the bend diagrams
is the complex wires that you had before the one with the lights and then stuff
except this time i have all of the wires oh fuck me okay so let me read it look at each wire
there's an okay four and four use the vendor here below so whether or not to cut the wires each
wire may be striped with multiple colors okay they're not just let you know okay okay so it's just um
okay sure i think i can get it okay so do i have to find which vent diagram to use
yes so i'll read you what the uh elements of the wire is and then you find that position on the
vent diagram you correspond that letter to the little chart and then even easy lemon squeezy okay
the first one is no light red no star none of these have stars
red yes red
no light red
so because there's no other elements you would just do the one that's only red
okay um overlaps so do i tell you now whether or not to cut it
yes okay cut the wire if the last digit of the serial number is even
i heard cut the wire in my fingers slipped okay it's five it's not fucking even okay the next one
is light red light red light light uh red oh led red
30 seconds i'm shall we uh same same thing same thing so i don't touch it okay um uh no light white
i don't think that's on there there's no there's no light oh fuck uh i died there's no white wires
yeah right so i think we just have to skip that one in that case okay i'm going to retry i'm going
to press retry okay okay okay okay i think we got this i think we got this bro okay now that we
both experienced it fucking hell oh oh oh okay uh wires normal wires okay there are one two three four
five it's one yellow one black one blue two white
is the last wire black it's white
say it again sorry yeah no worries it's one yellow one black one blue two white
okay cut the first wire cut the first wire pog okay uh numbers the number on the screen
um okay what's the display three okay press the button in the third position three that's
number three okay um then we have one only press the button labeled four uh so the first position
okay number one press the button with the same label as you press in stage two brother what did i
say it was four one you didn't say anything i fuck what's it water four it was four okay pog
okay pog uh i can't see she oh it's four four four okay press the button in the same with uh in the
same position as you press in stage two um is that one oh nice okay okay three okay press the button
in the same label as you press this no no there's two now there's two on the screen two there's two
oh yeah sorry press the button with the same label as you press in stage two
is that one or four was that one or four was that one or four oh fuck was that one or four
four oh my god oh my god oh my god god bless god bless okay okay okay now i have the same that
you had earlier that was one two three abc abc do you remember the name of that like what that was
called nope okay not at all okay okay okay let me look for it i think i might have been closer to
the middle oh yep within this one yeah that should hurt my brain that should make no sense to my brain
okay so if you want to go to the next level you hit the down button if you want to go to the
previous level you hit the up button okay okay do not switch until you're sure that you have cut
all the necessary wires though okay on the current panel okay okay hi hi um wire currents are cumulative
all over panels within the module okay okay tell me um tell me what the wires look like
yeah i'll give it to you one by one it's one b red one b
so wire currents yep yep okay so don't cut it okay don't cut it the next one is two red b red two b
two yes the second wire is red and it's connected to cut it cut it cut it cut it nice okay third wire
is black connected to b cut it cut it pog okay down i'm going down okay nice nice we got a light
the next one is fifth wire is red connected to c
um don't cut it don't cut it okay next is sixth wire is black c
cut it cut it nice okay next one okay we only have 40 seconds seven black c
don't cut it don't cut it red eight c
30 seconds don't cut it don't cut it uh red nine c
don't cut it okay nice oh fuck no that was wrong what
seven black c eight red c nine red c
no don't cut any of them you said the seventh black connected to c yeah
eighth eighth red red oh i side i don't know what i did wrong what the fuck happened there
were we on the last level i think that that was second to last oh hey at least i kind of got it
yeah you live yeah i had hope for a long time there okay let's do let's do one more game and then um
we'll stop there okay doki it's sweaty okay oh shit the timer started already um
uh let's do wires first black uh blue white red god how many
one of each four sorry four so there's one of each yeah yeah yeah yeah
one of each black got the first one oh the black cool okay uh numbers
okay i'm ready one um second position fuck i can't see that's three okay
okay uh three first position first position does the number two okay one three one two okay two
uh same label as you pressed in stage one uh uh fuck i just said it to myself i think it's three
okay that's second position um four um same position as you pressed in stage two
same position same position say two does first position okay that's three uh four four
same label as you pressed in stage three three uh it's that two or one was that two or one same
label two or one i'm gonna say it's one
fuck that was wrong okay my b okay three three we're starting over it's three oh
sure we're starting over okay um yeah we're starting over uh third position third position is the number one
okay three label three first position first position this number one okay it's one one so far
third position first position two same label as stage one one that's in the fourth position god
damn okay um three uh same position as stage two i think it's the third position no it was the
first position oh damn it did we have to start over again hold on hold on let me let me let me
fuck let me just kill myself real quick let me kill myself bro i can't
well i accidentally solved um the complex wires so uh we can just keep doing
i accidentally solved it because i just spam clicked every single one because i don't have any i
can't die anymore for what a reason that or i accidentally just clicked every single one
that was correct anyways um so back to numbers uh two is displayed oh fuck second position
but it's the second but it's the second stage it's second stage oh um same position as you
pressed in stage one brother i can't remember that brother you gotta remember it fuck stage one
has the first but nope so i really did just accidentally cut every single one of the complex
wires that's so fucking funny okay hold on you want to get one dub before we end let's get one
dub before we end okay did you want to defuse or do you want me to defuse i'll try defusing okay
sounds good let me end those games then because i accidentally hit retry return to office okay
okay i'll do something easy i'll do a hidden message does that work okay i don't know why
they're titled this way but okay ready let it all i i all right i'm locked in are you ready kids
i i captain i can't simon says first okay i can't hear you okay vowel yes no
oh no no uh uh uh what color red red blue hit blue
now you got a bunch of us stuck in my head red blue red blue blue red
no not blue red red blue now we have one strike though yellow green
no oh fuck did you say it doesn't contain it about i'm a dumb ass holy shit
it didn't contain a vowel oh god damn i'm not locked in okay red blue two strikes red blue okay
yellow green yes yes i'm a hundred percent certain okay okay red blue green red blue green
yellow green blue okay red blue green yellow okay perfect uh yellow green blue red
okay red blue green yellow yellow oh there's more red blue green yellow yellow yellow green blue red
red okay done okay now i have six wires okay uh three three four blue and two yellow four blue
two yellow oh god if there's no yellow wires nope if there's no two yellow two yellow yeah
oh god i gotta lock in and read this shit if there's no red wires no red right no cut the last one
got it okay okay so now the last one is it's it's the the words i think um where remember you
there's like oh the passwords yeah yeah okay okay where is it okay i see oh my god
so okay the first one is w ready mm-hmm okay w f e q v x and that's it so you have to find one
of the words on like in the first column that starts with you know one of those letters
okay did you find it mm-hmm okay so the next one is the next position is t q d i e j and yeah
one more time t q d i e j what the fuck
do none of the none of the words in the second column have
wait i don't get it wait so is it not like you you find a word that has all all of the combinations
no so the first letter in the first position is going to be the first letter in the word
okay right yeah okay so you find one of the letters in that first column
fuck i can't even hear myself speak you find one of the letters in that first column
that corresponds to any of the letters that i say and then you have to continue on horizontally
until until the until like you can understand um so can you can you say the first column
i just exploded oh because i find i found w and then i was like but for like the next letter it
doesn't it doesn't fit well like in that whole column all of the words should start with no
i'm not calm row in the whole row all the words should start with w then right right yeah but like
the second letter it doesn't fit i can well it only fits in one of them in the row right right
but but none of them have the second letter oh none of them had the second letter yeah wait hold on
overtime we have to get a dub okay we'll get a double we'll get a dub
um okay wires six wires three blue one white one black
three blue one white one black three blue one six wires yes three blue one white one black
three blue one white one black there are no yellow wires what's the last digit of the zero number
is it odd yes okay cut the third wire okay okay um let's do the the the
calculator with the words so okay cool it says lead le ad le ad what's the
bottom right word sure so how do you spell that s you are e s you are e okay
cause it's not a good time to burp okay you are spelled why oh you are e okay
um they are so t h e y a re okay what's the middle left why oh you why oh you

right sorry bottom right press press right middle yes wait wait wait wait wait
wait the lights are off okay okay okay okay okay ready okay good good
we're done we're done okay okay okay last one is the letters again with the
up and down letter oh the password the password yeah fuck okay this truly a
redemption of a lifetime okay let's go okay let's go okay first position first
letter is s v m i b x yeah okay first second one is m e x v n h okay okay
third one is a w okay sorry keep going yeah continue the sequence a w k y h q yeah okay I think you
have to smell the words small okay
