1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,840
What was made?

2
00:01:51,840 --> 00:02:21,680
Hi, let me switch to the music, there, now we can have the dress to impress music.

3
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,720
I tried to put on something fancy, I tried to dress to impress, do you like it, do I look cool?

4
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:41,280
Would you give me five stars? Shades, yep. We got shades today, so we're playing

5
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,120
Roblox, which is honestly a game I never thought I would play on stream.

6
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,840
But we're doing it, it's a game called dress to impress, it's basically where I don't have

7
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:01,120
a hangover, I'm just, I just, I'm just, I just ate some brownies before this, I don't want you to see

8
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:16,640
my eyes. It's a game where you, after a night of punishment, oh my god, this is dark. Okay, it's a

9
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,800
game where you basically, they give you a theme and you have to dress up your Roblox character

10
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,200
as that theme and then everyone takes their turn like going on the catwalk and we all vote for,

11
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,240
you know, we all give each other like ratings for our outfits and how well they stick to the

12
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:42,640
theme and stuff and, you know, there's winners and there's losers. I've already played a few games,

13
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,440
I can tell you that the kids, the children in Roblox are not on my side, they hate me.

14
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,600
There was one where I was, it was, I played one game where I was supposed to be like a meme,

15
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,440
like the, the theme was meme, right, and I dressed up as Pepe the Frog. I thought I did pretty good

16
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,600
compared to everyone else, but no, I literally got last place behind like a literal like,

17
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,760
naked person, like they were, they, they didn't adjust to their, their character at all, like

18
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,080
they didn't style it at all, I was so fucking pissed, like, I was losing my shit, this game actually

19
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:30,240
makes me mad, this game genuinely makes me really, really fucking mad. I don't think I'll rage as much

20
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,920
because I got, I got three other girls that, you know, can, can be on my side, give me, give me

21
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,720
more high ratings, please, I hope they do. Yeah, kids don't, these days don't know Peek when they

22
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:52,720
see it, exactly. Maybe they're just too, you know, they're just too, they're just too young,

23
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,680
they don't even know who Pepe the Frog is. They were probably thinking, what the fuck is this green

24
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:07,520
bitch? Yeah, they don't know. There's a reason why VTubers really stream Roblox outside of closed

25
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,720
lobby collabs. Wait, what's the reason? Am I hearing the game twice? What's going on here?

26
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,640
I don't know. Wait, what's the reason?

27
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,320
What is this song? It better not be copyrighted.

28
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:41,200
Anyways, I'm really happy to have been invited to this collab. I'm kind of shy. I'm a shy person in

29
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:48,000
collabs where I don't know people, so I might not like, I might not talk too much. I hope you

30
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:58,080
forgive me if I'm not too talkative. I'm shy. I am shy. So yeah, but I'll try to type and chat

31
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,320
to a little bit, see if I can. I'm guessing because everyone would join? Well, we're already in a lobby

32
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,160
together. You know? Already in a lobby together.

33
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,080
Eli is the only one I know, but she's a sweetheart, so don't be scared. I'm sure all the girls are

34
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,840
sweethearts. I'm just, I'm just, um, oh my god, I'm already so sweaty. I'm just shy.

35
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:36,320
I'm very shy, but I'm happy to have been invited. I'm just shy. Early in me, I know, I'm like

36
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,280
1am. It's basically 1am for me. I should be asleep at this time.

37
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,040
Oh, thank you. Thank you for the super chat. It's my sleep time, but have a good stream. Thank you.

38
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,240
Hmm. This music's kind of loud.

39
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,280
I might turn it down.

40
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,960
Enemy stream is early. Now I can actually watch you. Yeah. I don't know. I just, um,

41
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:21,280
you know, I just, I just streamed at whatever time they asked me. I'm pretty free when it comes to

42
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:29,120
the streaming times. I just usually don't stream early because I'm tired and asleep. I'm asleep

43
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,160
and tired, so that's why I usually don't stream this early.

44
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,760
I feel like this song is copyrighted.

45
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:50,240
Is this song copyrighted?

46
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,480
It is. This is just makes me a fuck. What the fuck, man?

47
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,520
They're just playing. Damn it. I really wanted to play the music from this game.

48
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Damn.

49
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay. Well, I'll be listening to Charlie XCX. You'll be listening to our regular background music.

50
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,520
Sorry.

51
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:35,520
Rats is summer? Hell yeah. Do I look cute? I think I look really cute. Listen, I was gonna,

52
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,440
I was gonna put on something else, but I got lazy and so I just looked through the

53
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,760
default VTube studio items and I saw these.

54
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,000
So yeah.

55
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:01,200
Also next week on Monday and Tuesday, I'm planning on going to a beach nearby and I'm so excited for

56
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,040
it. I'm so excited to go. I know I've been going on trips a lot, but it's only two days,

57
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,320
like you'll see me on Wednesday, you know? So it's fine. I'm not gonna be gone forever,

58
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,720
but I'm really excited. I'm so excited to go. I haven't been on a trip by myself in forever.

59
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,920
That's why I want to go because like peace and quiet. Peace and quiet, man. My family's really

60
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:33,680
loud and tiring, you know? So it'll be nice to have some peace and quiet. Also, I saw it,

61
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,960
I was looking through the Roblox characters and

62
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,600
listen, I folded. I feel like, okay, I feel like you can't see the emotion in my face.

63
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,640
I'm gonna take this item off. I feel like you can't see the emotion in my face. I want you to see me.

64
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,840
I saw the adorable Roblox

65
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:02,480
like characters that you can buy and I folded and I spent seven dollars and bought a Roblox.

66
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,280
Like, I bought a Roblox outfit. I spent seven dollars and I bought a Roblox outfit.

67
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,280
Vakini tryout pick? What? No, no, no, no. I only have one Vakini.

68
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,560
Vakini's, I don't, I'm not comfortable wearing Vakini's, so

69
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,600
I, uh,

70
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,120
I only have one Vakini and I'm not gonna show you a picture, absolutely not.

71
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,360
Seven dollars, I know.

72
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:47,520
I'll hold seven dollars. It's a lot. It's a lot. For me, it's a lot for a game.

73
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,640
For me, it's a lot for a game. Okay, I, I'm a, I'm a free to play player in every single game.

74
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,680
Can we at least get tan lines? Oh, no, I don't like to tan. Do you mean on this character?

75
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:10,000
No. I don't, I don't, I don't know. I, I'm not, like, I don't tan ever in real life.

76
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,080
Um, so, yeah.

77
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,160
A lot for a single outfit. It is, it is a lot. Yeah, that's like 75% of a McDonald's

78
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,560
combo. Now you're making me crave McDonald's. I made a new rule for myself, though, if I want to get

79
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,840
fast food, I'm not allowed to, sorry, I'm cleaning my glasses. Hold on. I made a new rule for myself.

80
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,440
If I want to get fast food, I'm not allowed to order it on Uber Eats. I have to go there myself and get it.

81
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:49,520
So, um, I, I, okay, I failed one time. I did order sushi one time, but it's sushi. It's healthy.

82
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,240
And it, I definitely didn't eat fried chicken with that sushi. Um, but I've been, I've been keeping to that

83
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,480
mostly now. So, I'm gonna have to get on the bus to go all the way to McDonald's.

84
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,160
Good way to start healthier. Yeah.

85
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,800
Okay, I'm ready to play. Uh, let's see if the other girls are ready.

86
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,800
Yeah, it's been about 10 minutes. Ready?

87
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,960
Oh, I have my French keyboard on and I always use the AX on.

88
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,600
Oh, is that AX on Grav or Aki? I don't know. Ready. Okay, Rui is ready.

89
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,880
I know it's so easy to hit that button. I know.

90
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,800
Um, Elia's ready. It's Elia, right? It's not Elia. It's Elia, right? Please tell me it's Elia.

91
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,880
Please tell me it's Elia. Please tell me her name is Elia. Please.

92
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,200
Jess is saying Elia's name weird on purpose. It's Elia?

93
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,760
Elia. Oops. Sorry. Elia. Elia.

94
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,200
She's not watching. It's okay. She's not here watching, right?

95
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,280
Elia. Okay. Elia Stilaria, right?

96
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,200
Right. Sorry. Um, okay. Everyone's ready. Oh, they already unmuted. Hold on.

97
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,800
The hair color. Oh, so all my face color changes.

98
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,400
It's like skin tones over here.

99
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,560
The palm tree. Skin tones. Look, only my face changes. Look at this.

100
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,440
It's only 36 seconds. Yeah, I'm not getting this one. I'm not ready.

101
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,080
Oh, shit. How do I get out of here? How do I get out of it once I'm done?

102
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,200
Oh, my gosh. You're so fast.

103
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,600
I'm skipping this round.

104
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,880
Oh, you're so fast. Okay. It's too fast. I only have 15 seconds.

105
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,040
I'm competing. I'm winning. I'm playing to win.

106
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,600
Right. Yeah, you guys, I told you I'm competitive.

107
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,360
Gotta beat these kiddos. Gotta show them who's boss.

108
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,760
Oh, my God. Oh, shit. Oh, my God. I win. Please vote for me.

109
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,760
Thank you. Thank you.

110
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,400
It's cute. It's cute. That's cute. Yeah. I like it.

111
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Wow. And she's so sporty. Look at that.

112
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,160
Do the clips on the runway.

113
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,320
This is so stressful. I didn't expect it.

114
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,400
Oh, wow, girly. How did she get those lids?

115
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,280
It's the makeup and the Botox.

116
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,240
By Dr. K. Dr. K?

117
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,800
From Beverly Hills. I'm making up my name.

118
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,160
Oh, this one's more like summer. Yeah.

119
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,400
Oh, don't forget to pose. Oh, I had you guys muted the entire time.

120
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,720
Oh, it's okay. It's the voices in my head.

121
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,840
You're like, why are you talking to yourself, Laffy?

122
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,480
It's kind of not spring, I think.

123
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,880
It's giving her red carpet than spring. Yeah.

124
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,000
Who's this beauty?

125
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,240
She's slaying. Five stars.

126
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,400
Five stars. Three for spring.

127
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,520
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

128
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,920
I'll gladly be your spring fluff from Queen.

129
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,480
How'd you get that color so bright?

130
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,920
Five stars, five stars, five stars.

131
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,960
I wasn't ready. Five stars, five stars.

132
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,240
Look at that square head.

133
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,320
That girl, you know, it's very natural.

134
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,800
I was going for the natural look.

135
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,080
That's so pretty.

136
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,800
Our parents are going to spin.

137
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,440
Look, the green. She's a tree.

138
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,720
How do I stop spinning? Okay.

139
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,280
Good dizzy.

140
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,440
Could you also not change your hair color?

141
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,320
You can. You can change your hair color.

142
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,960
I tried. I clicked it, but it just stayed black.

143
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,400
This is the summer again.

144
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,800
That's cute.

145
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,840
It is cute. I don't like that cup, though.

146
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,320
So many people are using that cup.

147
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,320
Yeah. Oh, that cup.

148
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,160
Boba.

149
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,920
An original.

150
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,760
The winners. Come on. Come on. Come on.

151
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,120
Me. Let's go.

152
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,200
Oh, my God. We're already in it.

153
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,240
Oh, my God. We're the children.

154
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,640
We're ugly.

155
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,600
Why are you lost?

156
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,920
Someone put ugly.

157
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,440
What?

158
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,720
Ugly. Why can't I give a theme?

159
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,120
I was suggesting a theme.

160
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,840
Wait. Oh, how do I move?

161
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,880
I'm trying to name my...

162
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,800
I'm going to make a custom theme.

163
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,920
I'm going to put VTuber.

164
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,120
Hey, how come?

165
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,760
I put Ilya.

166
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,960
They're going to be so confused.

167
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,880
They're going to be like, what the heck is a VTuber?

168
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,240
Wait, I have a theme prop.

169
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,240
She's someone who will buy it.

170
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,600
Okay, I didn't buy a theme.

171
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,760
I'm putting hololive.

172
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,120
I'm putting...

173
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,600
Heck yeah.

174
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,200
They asked Pat for some suggestions

175
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,040
and they gave me some for theme.

176
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,160
Good job, chat.

177
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,040
Good job, chat.

178
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,000
Wait, I have to have theme props?

179
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,640
What's that?

180
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,800
Theme props?

181
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,680
You need...

182
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,120
I guess you have to get it.

183
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,320
I tried getting one because I had extra leftover robots.

184
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,720
Wait, someone said little chocolate cracker.

185
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,520
Cry mom.

186
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,720
Oh, my God.

187
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,880
The theme is hololive.

188
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,840
Let's go.

189
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,440
Is that how you translate it?

190
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,640
Because it's German for me.

191
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,960
Chat is translated, yeah.

192
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,040
It's translated?

193
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,600
Hololive.

194
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,560
It keeps my outfit.

195
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,840
It's hololive.

196
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,480
Oh, my gosh.

197
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,360
Who's the easiest...

198
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,720
I'll try the holo guys over.

199
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,680
Oh, my gosh.

200
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,160
Oh, guys.

201
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,640
Put holo guys over.

202
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,680
I don't remember the holo guys.

203
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,240
Okay, okay, okay.

204
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,120
I choose holo.

205
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,040
I choose either.

206
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,320
I choose...

207
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,360
Wait, we're choosing?

208
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,320
Yeah, we don't want to know where we want it.

209
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,000
I think not just a surprise.

210
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,960
Like, we didn't see...

211
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,320
Oh, I choose you guys.

212
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,040
Maybe I should change then so we don't know.

213
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,280
Actually, yeah, yeah, I'm changing.

214
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,480
Can we look up references?

215
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:46,960
I don't remember.

216
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine.

217
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,200
You can totally look up references.

218
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,920
Okay, okay, okay.

219
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,320
Oh, do we add new hairstyle?

220
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
Let's see if I can get the hairstyle.

221
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,040
I want to look up the reference too, you know.

222
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,440
All right.

223
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,600
Okay.

224
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,560
Okay, I'm looking in.

225
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,480
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

226
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,520
Okay.

227
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,040
Oh, God, this is hard.

228
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,120
Oh, God, the time limit is pressure.

229
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,200
It's like embedded time pressure.

230
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,800
Why are the skin colors so strange?

231
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,040
Oh, what the heck?

232
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,920
Why did I get kicked out?

233
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,640
Oh, no.

234
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,160
Ah!

235
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,800
Can you time me out?

236
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,280
Wait, let me...

237
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,560
Thanks, thanks.

238
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,640
Like, why am I purple?

239
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,200
What the hell?

240
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,600
How do I have a normal skin color?

241
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,320
Okay, there we go.

242
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,480
Okay, okay, okay.

243
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,800
The bangs aren't going away with that.

244
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,800
Need shoes, need shoes.

245
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,080
This is close enough.

246
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,880
Okay, and then...

247
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,760
I'm getting married.

248
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,720
God, these are ugly bangs.

249
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,120
Be gone.

250
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,440
No, the hair color isn't changing.

251
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,960
Oh, this is so hard.

252
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,000
Did it?

253
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,040
This is pretty hard.

254
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,840
Oh, no.

255
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,480
Stressful.

256
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,640
How do I get rid of?

257
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,080
Wait, how do I put the clothes off?

258
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
I'm still wearing the dress from Lustrone.

259
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,280
There's a button on the right.

260
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,440
On the right.

261
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,840
Yeah.

262
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,480
Ah!

263
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,680
And then you press the X.

264
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,240
Did you get it?

265
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,280
Uh, um, um, no, no, no.

266
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,840
No?

267
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,080
No?

268
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,720
No.

269
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,600
Oh, my hair is gone.

270
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,240
That's something.

271
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,040
Oh, I got it.

272
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,280
I got it.

273
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,160
Okay, thank you.

274
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,880
Okay, good, good, good.

275
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,200
And then, oh, God, this is hard.

276
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,560
No one asked what's the theme.

277
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,200
What's all alive?

278
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,640
We need...

279
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,720
And then we need strings.

280
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,840
And then we need shorts.

281
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,600
You can stack hair that's so helpful.

282
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,280
I know, right?

283
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,640
Yeah, the hair stack is a...

284
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:50,960
Difficult.

285
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,960
Oh, God, I need shoes.

286
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,720
Oh, man, this is so...

287
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,720
It's gonna be really hard to guess the characters I feel like.

288
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,560
Someone's able to...

289
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,360
Who are the dresses?

290
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,480
Buy for 700?

291
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,280
Do I look rich?

292
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,400
Can I have some of these?

293
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,040
I need a...

294
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,640
Oh, God, how many things can I layer on?

295
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,280
Where are the dresses?

296
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,440
Where are the clothes?

297
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,000
Where are the clothes?

298
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,680
Is there...

299
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,680
Is there any sweater with a hoodie?

300
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,240
I think so.

301
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:42,640
Oh, my God, this is difficult.

302
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,120
I need a...

303
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,120
Something to go on my head.

304
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,840
Belt through the belt.

305
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,360
I really took my shirt off, fuck.

306
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,160
Oh, socks.

307
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,480
Oh, no.

308
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,680
Actually...

309
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,320
I need like a crown.

310
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,720
Oh, my God.

311
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,040
Put on.

312
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,040
Oh, my God.

313
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,600
Where's the belt?

314
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,080
Oh, it's so over.

315
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,440
I'm sorry.

316
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,000
You have me too.

317
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,280
I'm so lost.

318
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,240
Where's the belt?

319
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,640
Oh, God.

320
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,840
Where is the accessories?

321
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,240
Why?

322
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,560
Oh, my God.

323
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,600
There's only two minutes left.

324
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,400
There's one minute left.

325
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
I can kind of see the vision on mine, though.

326
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,000
Like a bit.

327
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,200
I can't see why.

328
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,840
That's good.

329
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,600
I can't see the vision on mine at all.

330
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,600
Say thank you, guys.

331
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,320
Maybe.

332
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,040
I want to see the vision.

333
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,520
Maybe.

334
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,560
Oh, oh, yeah.

335
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,120
I tell you.

336
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,200
How do I get out of the hair thing when I'm done with it?

337
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,920
Of space.

338
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,800
But see me so much time.

339
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,880
I've been just sat there till the time's out.

340
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,640
Wait, there's only two rooms for clothes, right?

341
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,600
Or am I missing something?

342
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,680
Yeah, the other room is like...

343
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,040
VIP.

344
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,320
Yeah.

345
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,840
Yeah.

346
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,640
There's no thighs.

347
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,280
Oh, hey.

348
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,680
Thighs.

349
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,320
Let's go.

350
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,960
Oh, I need it.

351
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,800
Oh, where's the necklaces?

352
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,160
Is there a choker somewhere?

353
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:03,760
Oh, yeah.

354
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,560
Good enough.

355
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,920
Are there socks anywhere?

356
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,640
There's thighs.

357
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,760
There's thigh highs?

358
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,640
There's thigh.

359
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,520
Yeah, here, here.

360
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,360
Where?

361
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,960
If you face the hairdressing room and go out, then on the left.

362
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,680
Oh, okay.

363
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,040
Where the glasses are and the hats.

364
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,680
No ribbons?

365
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,440
No ribbons.

366
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,000
On the left.

367
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,320
On the left.

368
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,360
Need ears.

369
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,320
Where do I get ears?

370
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,800
Here.

371
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,720
Where?

372
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,160
What?

373
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,200
I don't have time.

374
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,520
No.

375
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,920
Oh, no, there's only 10 seconds left.

376
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,480
I already have 10 seconds.

377
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,520
I have to get out of time.

378
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,720
Where's the ears?

379
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,920
Oh, there's the thigh highs.

380
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,920
Oh, my God.

381
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,360
Where's the beady with the hat on?

382
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,560
Oh, no, I don't have time.

383
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,360
Bye.

384
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,400
Oh, no.

385
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,120
Good luck.

386
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,600
Let's see up.

387
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,480
That's who...

388
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:50,960
Who is this?

389
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,240
Who is this?

390
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,680
Who's this coconut drinking punk?

391
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,600
Who is this?

392
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,640
One star.

393
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,600
Who is this?

394
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,520
They don't know.

395
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,600
I think you can also chat to say who is...

396
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,560
Yeah, who is this?

397
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,240
Ah, I'm writing chat.

398
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,680
Who is this?

399
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,440
Yeah, I want to know.

400
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,680
If I'm able to recognize it, I'd like to know.

401
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,560
They censored me.

402
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,120
What the heck?

403
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,240
Who is this?

404
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,920
I just went and knocked my VTuber.

405
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,880
I didn't understand the theme.

406
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,640
These kids don't know what VTubers are.

407
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,240
They need to learn.

408
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,720
They need to learn, yeah.

409
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,520
We got to school.

410
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,440
Okay, wait.

411
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,600
Ayo?

412
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,520
No, why would we censor?

413
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,400
Yeah, how can we censor?

414
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,680
And what are you saying?

415
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,560
VTubers.

416
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,680
VTubers censor.

417
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,560
VTubers.

418
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,280
Oh, look at me.

419
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,240
Wait, why is VTubers...

420
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,480
Wait, wait, wait.

421
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,320
I can't change the hair color.

422
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,360
Mine is censored too.

423
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

424
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,520
Oh, wait, Laffy, no.

425
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:45,920
Laffy, no.

426
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,960
Wait, Laffy, wait, wait.

427
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,680
Why can't you do that?

428
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,120
Oh, wait, Laffy, that's so bad.

429
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,960
I'm so sorry, Laffy.

430
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,400
Is this Gora?

431
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,720
Yes.

432
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,440
Did you go Gora?

433
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,240
Yeah, Gora.

434
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,440
Oh, my God, you're the...

435
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,000
Cawaii.

436
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,000
Gora, that's cute.

437
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,000
Thank you, thank you.

438
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,560
How come VTubers are censored?

439
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,920
Wait, what if I only type VTuber?

440
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,600
Oh, is it censored?

441
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,120
It is, it is.

442
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,520
Is this Cali?

443
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,560
It's Cali.

444
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,520
It's Cali.

445
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,040
Oh, that looks good.

446
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,240
That's so good.

447
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,000
It does look super good.

448
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,960
Very accurate.

449
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,600
Immediately recognized.

450
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,720
It is.

451
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,280
I found a crown and I was like, I can do it.

452
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,400
Oh, my God.

453
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,400
No.

454
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,000
That's some bells.

455
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,400
Yeah.

456
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,400
Oh, yeah.

457
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,560
That's the only thing I'm going to find

458
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,520
that kind of close in.

459
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,680
No, it looks really good.

460
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,960
Oh, my God.

461
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,600
I thought I can't change the hair color, though.

462
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,680
Look, I click the colors, but they just stay black.

463
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,080
There's something you need to pay attention to.

464
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,560
Did you press on the check mark?

465
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,200
Who is this?

466
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,880
I know.

467
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm not sure.

468
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,920
Sora in fancy clothing.

469
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,800
The hair color fits.

470
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,240
What if I knew VTubers?

471
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,400
Oh, it's so censored.

472
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,600
Yeah, it's censored.

473
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,720
It's VEE.

474
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,200
Weird.

475
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,960
Who's this?

476
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,200
They said that it didn't get it.

477
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,400
I didn't get it.

478
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,040
What the heck?

479
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,680
No one knows.

480
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,280
That's a lot of people that didn't get it.

481
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,000
You guys are noobs.

482
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,120
Not cultured.

483
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,240
Not cultured enough.

484
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,280
You're not cultured.

485
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,640
You guys are noobs.

486
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,280
This is a chat.

487
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,200
YouTubers.

488
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,640
Not your censor, too.

489
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,040
Hello.

490
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,720
Oh, God.

491
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,640
That's nice.

492
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,760
Yeah, they didn't understand the assignment.

493
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,320
New tab.

494
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,520
How do I do a new tab?

495
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,040
Sittings?

496
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,040
New tab.

497
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,840
Be the sitting.

498
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,320
I'm going to think of fantabit.

499
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,000
We failed our mission.

500
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,280
VTubers censorship.

501
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,560
Yeah.

502
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,760
What the hell?

503
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,960
No way to go.

504
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,440
Let's go.

505
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,000
Let's go.

506
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,520
I know the red has got it.

507
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,160
Let's go.

508
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,760
You guys are always owning it.

509
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,320
We're cooking.

510
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,760
We're cooking.

511
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,800
We'll be cooking.

512
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,640
Let's see.

513
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,320
Can we do...

514
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,040
Like you've seen the mission, right?

515
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,080
There's like blue and then there's a red and white.

516
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,960
Who is it though?

517
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,560
It's Sora.

518
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh.

519
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,560
Okay.

520
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:24,960
Okay.

521
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,800
I get a cross.

522
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,520
I see the vision.

523
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,240
I see the vision.

524
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,720
Yeah.

525
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,200
Thank you.

526
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,560
Never doubt, Jimmy.

527
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,640
We're putting in a costume.

528
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,240
Wait, you can change the music here?

529
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,120
Is this what this is?

530
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,760
Oh, really?

531
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,960
No, it's just the brat shop.

532
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,400
Oh, there's an apple.

533
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,720
What is apple dance?

534
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,360
What is that?

535
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,600
They don't even show you what it is?

536
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,600
They just want me to buy it.

537
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,800
Would you like to buy?

538
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,040
No.

539
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,280
Got to get money from those kids somehow.

540
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,320
Oh, it's League of Legends.

541
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,160
Yeah, great choice.

542
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,240
The kids aren't going to understand that.

543
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,520
They're like, you're like more common, isn't it?

544
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,040
Like they're going to be in shambles.

545
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,000
Okay, let's go.

546
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,280
Oh god, I hope we can do this.

547
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,840
Okay.

548
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,920
Who's League of Legends character I sound like?

549
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,360
I forgot the name.

550
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,160
Hold on.

551
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,080
Who is the League character?

552
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
Teemo, Teemo, Teemo.

553
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,000
Okay, Teemo.

554
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,960
I'm going to be Teemo.

555
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,360
Can you do the Teemo laugh?

556
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,720
I don't know what the Teemo laugh is.

557
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,880
Okay, I'll keep this.

558
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,840
Kinda.

559
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,600
I don't play League.

560
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,920
I just know I kind of sound like Teemo a little bit.

561
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,320
I don't play either.

562
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,840
I mean, I tried it, but.

563
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,360
Yeah, I tried it.

564
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,640
Yeah, I'm kind of trash.

565
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,760
Oh, great game.

566
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,320
Great game.

567
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,160
Quality game.

568
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,720
Pink.

569
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,000
How do I make it pink?

570
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,160
Oh, which character should I kind of be?

571
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,200
Oh, this is going to be hard, Ordo.

572
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,400
Like this kind of pink.

573
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,840
And then eyes maybe pink.

574
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,800
Everything's so expensive.

575
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,920
Did you guys know there's a Walmart land in Roblox?

576
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,280
A what?

577
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,840
What?

578
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,960
A Walmart land.

579
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,560
There is.

580
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:22,880
Yeah.

581
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,800
What do you usually do in Roblox?

582
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,160
I don't know anything.

583
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,760
I know so many things you can do.

584
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,760
It's mostly a lot of like mini games, I think.

585
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,080
Right?

586
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,120
Yeah, I love mini games.

587
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,480
Yeah, mini games.

588
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,360
I have no idea.

589
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,120
Wait, I can wear a man pants?

590
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,840
Hello?

591
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,040
Yeah, I know it's that.

592
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,760
Yeah, I know, right?

593
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,160
You can't wear guy clothes.

594
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,040
That's so weird.

595
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:46,880
Does that...

596
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,560
Do you have to like be a guy to wear the guy clothes?

597
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,120
I guess.

598
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,960
How does that work?

599
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,840
Guys, I've no idea what league champion to dress as.

600
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,480
I'm so lost.

601
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,720
But you play league the most.

602
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,000
I know, so I'm so lost.

603
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,400
I'm like...

604
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,200
There's so many options.

605
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,560
I know, right?

606
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,160
Okay.

607
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,720
Let's uh...

608
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,640
I need gloves.

609
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
I want to change color right now.

610
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,600
Oh, there you go.

611
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,640
All right, let me change the color.

612
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,880
Maybe, this is the closest I could think of.

613
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,000
There's no spiky hair anywhere.

614
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,480
I think I saw a nickel just now.

615
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,080
That might be me.

616
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,200
I can't...

617
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,360
There's no hairs that are close enough to it.

618
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:32,880
I think.

619
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,440
Is there skin tied shirt somewhere?

620
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,240
Oh, this is good.

621
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Oh no, it's $3,500.

622
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,720
No, thank you.

623
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,040
Oh, I can't do anything.

624
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,480
This is the most I can do.

625
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,680
Oh, actually, I don't like it.

626
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,200
I wish I could take my bra off.

627
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,280
Teemo doesn't wear oil.

628
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,040
I don't know how to make the spiky hair.

629
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,120
But you want to make Teemo?

630
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,600
Yeah!

631
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,320
I want to make Teemo.

632
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,680
That's what I'm trying to do right now.

633
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
Oh, fuck, wrong pants.

634
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,320
Oops.

635
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
If there's only two minutes left.

636
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,520
Oh my gosh, I spent too much time.

637
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,640
Why is it on top?

638
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,760
Why is this on top?

639
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,720
Why is the layering weird?

640
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,760
Is there like a mermaid?

641
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,440
I swear I saw someone with like a fishtail.

642
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,640
I saw someone with like a fishtail.

643
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,600
Where did they get that from?

644
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,120
They probably paid for it.

645
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,720
What?

646
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,640
They probably paid for it.

647
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,520
Oh, what the fuck?

648
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,080
Is there a scarf anywhere?

649
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,480
I need a top.

650
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,080
Oh, here's a scarf.

651
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,000
I'm so lost.

652
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,240
I look terrible.

653
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,800
I look nothing like Teemo.

654
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,600
I look nothing like what I'm supposed to be.

655
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,520
I need longer pants, I think.

656
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,080
Like this.

657
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:56,960
There we go.

658
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,480
What do I do?

659
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,280
Is there a flower somewhere?

660
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,040
Where did I find that crown before?

661
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,760
Oh my god.

662
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,320
You barefoot?

663
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,800
I'm so lost.

664
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,880
Okay, wait, where's the makeup?

665
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,520
Oh, there, okay.

666
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,240
Yeah.

667
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,320
Oh, I can do that.

668
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,640
What the fuck is this?

669
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,680
I'm terrifying.

670
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,120
I'm going to gasify Teemo.

671
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,640
Oh god, there's like one minute and I don't hate Teemo.

672
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,120
There you go.

673
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,680
I'm just going to do this pink.

674
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,280
I want a fishtail.

675
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,920
I got bamboozled by someone else with a fishtail.

676
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,880
I thought I could be Nami, but no.

677
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,720
No, I think I see the vision again,

678
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,400
but I said that last time, so maybe not.

679
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,280
Oh god, there's one minute left.

680
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,480
Wait, oh, what do I do for shoes?

681
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,440
Brown, maybe?

682
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,000
Wait, do you guys play League?

683
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,360
How many of you play League?

684
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,160
I play League.

685
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,400
I tried it, at least.

686
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,560
Laffy?

687
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,440
There's no tail.

688
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,040
There's no tail.

689
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,040
Laffy is gone.

690
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,920
There is no tail.

691
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,640
There's nothing.

692
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,800
It's hard to guess.

693
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,400
Where's the flower?

694
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,440
There's already a flower.

695
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,640
I'm looking for a shirt.

696
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
Makeup, make it skin color.

697
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,840
Actually, I think I saw Nicola somewhere.

698
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,560
There we go.

699
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,400
This one.

700
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,240
This theme is difficult.

701
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,360
I always have no shoes.

702
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,280
Why are my tits popping out of my shirt?

703
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,080
What's going on?

704
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,600
What the hell?

705
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,600
Do I have a bra or something?

706
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,440
I don't.

707
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,800
Oh god, it's over.

708
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,200
It's over?

709
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,320
It's over?

710
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,600
I didn't change my skin color.

711
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,720
Oh god.

712
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,280
Oh, who is this?

713
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,320
I just tried.

714
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,720
Oh, damn.

715
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,680
That is difficult.

716
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,360
I have no idea what characters are.

717
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,520
I'm sorry.

718
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,840
I'm a toxic Roblox player.

719
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,880
Who is this?

720
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:08,960
Yeah.

721
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,320
Wait, Laffy, you mute.

722
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,160
Is she the thing guy?

723
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,520
She was muted.

724
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,240
You were muted.

725
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:16,720
Oh no.

726
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,640
It is Lux.

727
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:18,960
Yeah.

728
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,080
This theme is best.

729
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,680
He's cute though.

730
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,240
I tried.

731
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,280
You put.

732
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,240
We're not good.

733
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,520
It's not good at all.

734
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,320
Very good.

735
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,080
It's very good.

736
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:39,840
Thank you.

737
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,160
Oh, I forgot to pose.

738
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,480
Shit.

739
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,720
Oh my goodness.

740
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,960
Imagine this is a mermaid.

741
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,480
That's so pretty though.

742
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,120
It does though.

743
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,800
It does look like a mermaid.

744
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,000
Pose, pose, pose, pose.

745
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,480
Yeah.

746
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,120
Yeah.

747
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,200
Beautiful.

748
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,720
Yay.

749
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,920
I wish I could whistle.

750
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,600
Yeah.

751
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,640
There's no fishtail and I didn't change the color.

752
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,920
I can't do anything.

753
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,760
Yeah, Nico.

754
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,000
I can't find the hair.

755
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,440
No spiky hair.

756
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,400
It looks spiky.

757
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,440
Wow.

758
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
You know so much about the game, do you?

759
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,680
This is, um,

760
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:30,800
Nope.

761
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,960
I don't recognize this character.

762
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,200
Yeah.

763
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,280
Nope.

764
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,760
Nope.

765
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,320
Nope.

766
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,960
Nope.

767
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,440
Nope.

768
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,320
Toxic.

769
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,120
Well, the P makes it cute.

770
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,120
They're going to look up League of Legends.

771
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,640
Now look what's going to happen.

772
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,720
They're going to be like, what is it?

773
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,080
Google's League of Legends.

774
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,120
We've started the addiction.

775
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:52,640
We did.

776
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,760
Which character?

777
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,720
They're going to be curious.

778
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,640
Which character is this?

779
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,080
I don't know.

780
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,800
What is this?

781
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,440
V.

782
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,080
What is V?

783
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,200
V?

784
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,840
V like V?

785
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,400
Downvote.

786
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,120
Oh, what?

787
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,040
What is going on?

788
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,280
Wait, how did she do that?

789
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,560
Wait, there's the Nami.

790
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,560
That's so cool.

791
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,760
How did she do that?

792
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,880
It's a fishtail dress.

793
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,360
Even I don't know how to play.

794
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,920
Four stars.

795
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,280
Four stars.

796
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,920
Okay.

797
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,760
How did it count?

798
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,200
I can't keep it down too far.

799
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,480
How the heck did they do that?

800
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,280
Yeah, what the hell?

801
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,360
I don't know.

802
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,520
This looks like a Winks Club character.

803
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,080
Yeah, right?

804
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,560
It does.

805
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,600
All VIP?

806
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,920
Wait, I have...

807
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,680
Where are the VIP?

808
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,920
Maybe they bought it?

809
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:43,840
I don't know.

810
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,560
I didn't see it.

811
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,360
That's so crazy.

812
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,400
Near Rising Star?

813
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,760
What?

814
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,240
What?

815
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,360
Dude, that third one was so Nami-like.

816
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,560
It was fourth place.

817
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,760
Yeah, it was so good.

818
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,040
It was really good.

819
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,640
Where the heck did they get that from?

820
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,160
Here, I'll do something every...

821
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,400
I'm pretty sure all of these kids know this.

822
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,640
If they don't...

823
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,920
What did you put in?

824
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,720
Fortnite.

825
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,520
Fortnite?

826
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,920
No, I don't know Fortnite.

827
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,400
I did my little pony.

828
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,440
Oh, my little pony.

829
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,400
Oh, that's perfect.

830
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,480
How does one dress like my little pony?

831
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,640
Or like a human version of my little pony?

832
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,320
It's a little pony character.

833
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,600
So not a pony?

834
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,040
Yeah, yeah.

835
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,600
Like the...

836
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,200
My little human.

837
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
They have humanized version in the show.

838
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,040
It's called...

839
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,760
Oh.

840
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,160
Hold on.

841
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,200
Can you get up now?

842
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,440
Yeah.

843
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,400
Equestria girls.

844
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,520
You can dress as the equestria girls.

845
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,680
And they're already humans.

846
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,760
Ooh.

847
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,160
Okay.

848
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:51,840
Searching.

849
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,280
We're doing my research for this.

850
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,040
Oh, that's kind of uncanny.

851
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,360
It is a little uncanny.

852
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,160
That's cute.

853
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,480
It is cute.

854
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:00,880
Let's go.

855
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,560
That's cute.

856
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,600
Wait, it's starting?

857
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,080
Oh, shit.

858
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,720
My little pony.

859
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,680
Okay, let's go.

860
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,560
Okay, okay, okay.

861
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:10,880
All right.

862
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,840
If I can change my hair color.

863
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,440
I just want to change my skin color.

864
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,240
Get naked.

865
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,960
I'm going to try to be fluttershy.

866
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,960
Oh, okay, okay.

867
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,440
I'll do...

868
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,720
I don't know which one's which.

869
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,680
I'll do...

870
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,680
I just picked one that kind of looked...

871
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,680
Is there no color close enough though?

872
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:31,920
I think...

873
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,400
Oh, actually...

874
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:33,760
Maybe...

875
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,240
This one's so cute though.

876
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,960
And then I'll do...

877
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,560
This is...

878
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,440
Do you guys have a favorite My Little Pony character?

879
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,200
I never watched this.

880
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,400
I don't know anyone.

881
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
The only one I know my name is Fluttershy.

882
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,360
That's okay.

883
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,640
How do I do this?

884
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,240
We should do wings next.

885
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,800
We should.

886
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,040
That would be cute.

887
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,000
Where'd the pants go?

888
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,120
Is this a pony tail?

889
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,600
Oh.

890
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,240
You can't...

891
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:22,560
I think...

892
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:29,680
Damn it.

893
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,720
I know, someone's excited.

894
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,720
I've been waiting for this moment for my life.

895
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,000
But are you a bit really?

896
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,360
My little...

897
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,720
You like My Little Pony?

898
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,560
No, some person put it in.

899
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,160
Someone in chat said it.

900
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,240
The brownies are coming.

901
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,080
Let's make the thing pinkish.

902
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,080
Okay.

903
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,320
What's all this money on the floor for?

904
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,760
What can I do with it?

905
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,440
I think you can buy stuff from it.

906
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,200
Like in the game?

907
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,400
Yeah.

908
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,840
Oh, okay.

909
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,080
I'm about to make the cutest Fluttershy ever.

910
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,600
Yeah, what should I...

911
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,960
Oh, Ribbon's cute.

912
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,760
Where's the hair accessories?

913
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,440
I still have a man face.

914
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,400
700!

915
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:22,960
Oh my god.

916
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,280
That's expensive for that dress.

917
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,800
You can't afford that VIP.

918
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,760
Got to start getting a job in Roblox.

919
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,840
This hair is too bright.

920
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,280
That's kind of cute.

921
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,560
Oh my god.

922
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,560
Oh yeah, I need shoes.

923
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,280
I need shoes.

924
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,800
What about this?

925
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,600
Wait.

926
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,200
Oh no, I'm getting the same glitch

927
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,680
where my clothing isn't changing color.

928
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,320
Are some...

929
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,040
Is some clothing locked in the color?

930
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,480
I don't think so.

931
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:10,960
Oh never mind.

932
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,840
You just have to up the dark value.

933
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,040
Because it's on the black.

934
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,680
On the black.

935
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,120
Yeah, it's on the black end.

936
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,400
That was my problem.

937
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,280
Okay.

938
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:20,960
Here we go.

939
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,880
And then where's the socks?

940
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,400
I think this one's kind of cute too.

941
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,280
Oh no.

942
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,640
There's the socks.

943
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,680
I keep forgetting that you can actually wear the other...

944
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,640
Oh, oh come on.

945
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,920
Why do they let you...

946
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
Why do they let you layer clothing

947
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,320
if they don't actually let you layer clothing?

948
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:42,560
Right?

949
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,800
It's like lifting sometimes, right?

950
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,120
Yeah.

951
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,640
What is this?

952
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,640
The order is random too, right?

953
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,840
It's like I'll put on a belt.

954
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,880
No, I won't.

955
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,040
You're not allowed to see the belt.

956
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,120
You can have it, but you're not allowed to see it.

957
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,840
Oh, the patterns are so ugly.

958
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,000
What?

959
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,360
Hair clips.

960
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,000
Where are you?

961
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,360
So sorry.

962
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,480
I need to change my shirt again.

963
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,200
Are there hair clips somewhere?

964
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,680
I don't know.

965
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,640
I was hoping there would be.

966
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,520
I need to use hair clips.

967
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,680
There we go.

968
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,680
This doesn't look good.

969
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,800
I don't know.

970
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,760
It's okay.

971
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,960
We'll vote five stars for each other and we'll totally...

972
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,160
Oh my god!

973
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,920
I just saw the prettiest...

974
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,760
Fuck, I forgot the name of my whole body character.

975
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,560
Holy shit.

976
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,360
Twilight, Twilight, Twilight.

977
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,440
I just saw the prettiest Twilight character

978
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,400
walk by me.

979
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,040
Holy shit.

980
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,760
I don't know.

981
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,320
I don't know.

982
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:46,880
I don't know.

983
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,440
I don't know.

984
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:47,920
I don't know.

985
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,480
I don't know.

986
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:48,880
I don't know.

987
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,360
I don't know.

988
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:49,920
I don't know.

989
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,560
I don't know.

990
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,120
I don't know.

991
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,680
Holy shit.

992
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,480
Is there a lollipop somewhere?

993
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,360
I'm not sure.

994
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,160
That'd be kind of cute.

995
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,120
34 seconds.

996
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,240
This would be cute.

997
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,840
Oh, I know that one.

998
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,040
That's Twilight.

999
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,400
That's something I was expecting.

1000
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,600
Okay, cute accessories.

1001
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:11,920
Oh.

1002
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,280
Ice cream maybe?

1003
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,840
So I'm the closest I can have with just ice cream.

1004
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,080
Coco not to die, so no.

1005
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,760
I did ice cream instead.

1006
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,600
I don't know if there's a lollipop somewhere.

1007
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,440
Oh, are you doing Pinkie Pie?

1008
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,200
Is that why you have candy?

1009
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:33,840
Oh.

1010
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,840
Oh, no, I'm talking minty.

1011
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,600
Are you doing minty?

1012
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,560
Yeah.

1013
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,360
Oh my god.

1014
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,680
Minty's my favorite character.

1015
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,320
Oh, really?

1016
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:42,640
Yeah.

1017
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,240
Okay, this is Rarity, right?

1018
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,520
This is cute.

1019
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,480
A little bit.

1020
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,360
I feel like for Rarity, it's a little bit toned down.

1021
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,360
Mmm.

1022
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:51,680
Yeah.

1023
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,360
Rarity would do way more than that.

1024
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,840
Oh, you did Fluttershy too?

1025
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,400
Yeah.

1026
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,120
Yeah.

1027
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,160
The only one I knew.

1028
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,800
That's so cute.

1029
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,840
That's cute.

1030
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,160
I guess the human version is reference, like you said.

1031
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,360
Adorable.

1032
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,440
Fluttershy's been meeling.

1033
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,080
Oh, another Fluttershy.

1034
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,400
Oh, my god.

1035
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,760
A stylish one this time.

1036
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,520
I love it.

1037
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,360
I feel like a bunch of these.

1038
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,720
Three of us went for Fluttershy.

1039
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,440
Three of us went for Fluttershy.

1040
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,960
I went for Fluttershy.

1041
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,600
Oh, no.

1042
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,480
Fluttershy.

1043
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,760
For your magic.

1044
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,520
Oh, my god.

1045
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,880
I'm surprised no one did Rainbow Dash.

1046
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,040
Rainbow Dash is hard to make with the rainbow hair.

1047
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,840
Rainbow hair.

1048
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,400
If she's like.

1049
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,760
Yeah, exactly.

1050
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,400
I think you can do, like, duos or partners, right?

1051
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,160
I think you can.

1052
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:02,480
Yeah.

1053
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,320
Minty.

1054
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:04,960
Minty.

1055
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,720
Oh, so cute.

1056
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,480
I was trying to look for a lollipop, because like the circle one,

1057
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,360
because it looks like the one in her butt or leg.

1058
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,720
Yeah, her cutie line.

1059
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,520
Yeah.

1060
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,920
Oh, that's so cute.

1061
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,040
That's so cute.

1062
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,240
That's Twilight, right?

1063
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:24,480
Yeah.

1064
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,200
You might recognize it.

1065
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,640
It looks really good.

1066
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,680
I don't know why the ice cream's there, but the rest looks so good.

1067
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:35,760
Flay, Queen.

1068
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,000
Oh, Rainbow Stick and Voyage 2.

1069
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,640
That's true.

1070
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,080
Uh, who is this?

1071
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,360
Oh, Pinkie Pie?

1072
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,920
Look, it's cute too.

1073
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,280
Oh my gosh, I'm making one.

1074
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:47,680
I can't.

1075
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,560
I'm so scared of the kids.

1076
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,560
Yeah, I'm trying to be in Legend of Jenny.

1077
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,720
Okay, this is Rarity, right?

1078
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,360
That's pretty.

1079
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,720
Is it Rarity?

1080
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,160
Who is this?

1081
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,800
Wow.

1082
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,600
Oh, Rarity, yeah.

1083
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,640
Wendy's kid's so good.

1084
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:11,600
Right?

1085
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,560
Holy shit.

1086
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,680
Matter popping off when we did My Little Pony.

1087
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,560
What's some other popular kid's stuff that we know?

1088
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,680
Oh, shit.

1089
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,240
I don't know.

1090
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,320
Yeah, you wanted to do, was it Winks?

1091
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:24,960
Winks, yeah.

1092
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,840
Yeah, Winks, yeah.

1093
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,680
Do you think it stays no Winks?

1094
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,400
I don't know.

1095
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,280
I don't know Winks.

1096
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,560
It's a hard generation.

1097
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,360
Let's find out.

1098
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,720
Okay, sure.

1099
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,320
We'll find out.

1100
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,120
Just vote one star and get it over with.

1101
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,800
Oh, sorry.

1102
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,080
I joined with two minutes.

1103
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,040
Damn, girl.

1104
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:43,680
Just vote once.

1105
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,400
Are you going to win?

1106
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,280
Okay, this is the only one I'll vote one star.

1107
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,400
Okay, say I'm doing this.

1108
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,080
Why do they say they vote one star?

1109
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:50,960
That's so mean.

1110
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,600
They got no mercy.

1111
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,040
Yeah.

1112
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,040
A Power Rangers.

1113
00:46:59,040 --> 00:46:59,920
That's also a good idea.

1114
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,520
That's so good.

1115
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,160
Wow, you're awesome.

1116
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,160
Oh, damn.

1117
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:10,800
They slayed.

1118
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,280
They slayed.

1119
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,080
You guys slayed too.

1120
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,440
But I really like the Verdi.

1121
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:15,680
Thank you.

1122
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,160
Should we do Winks then?

1123
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,520
Yes, Winks is a good one.

1124
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,400
Who's your favorite Winks girl?

1125
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,520
I think I like the orange.

1126
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,400
I forgot their name.

1127
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,000
Okay, I need to look them up.

1128
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,600
I need to look them up too.

1129
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,920
The orange-haired one is my favorite.

1130
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,720
Oh, the orange-haired one is really cute.

1131
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,440
Main character.

1132
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,160
I think I like the black-haired one.

1133
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,400
Musa?

1134
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,520
I think I'll do the purple.

1135
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,560
She's my favorite too.

1136
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,800
I'll try Musa.

1137
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,000
Let me see.

1138
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,800
Winks Club.

1139
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,240
I used to cosplay as Bloom in the elementary school.

1140
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:52,800
Oh, really?

1141
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,600
I used to wink at all.

1142
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:53,840
Yeah.

1143
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,280
I'll try doing Stella.

1144
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,520
Oh, she's cute.

1145
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,160
I don't even know what the text suit looking thing is.

1146
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:06,880
I forgot her name.

1147
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,960
Oh, I know which one you're talking about.

1148
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,760
She has Winks.

1149
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,640
She has pink hair.

1150
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,200
Techna, I think.

1151
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:19,680
Techna.

1152
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,200
Yeah, Techna.

1153
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:22,640
Starting.

1154
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,160
Oh my gosh, you need to be faster.

1155
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:26,640
Here we go.

1156
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:27,760
Oh, it's starting.

1157
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,000
Oh, no.

1158
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:29,760
I haven't picked one.

1159
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,680
Let's see here.

1160
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,680
All right, I'm going to do...

1161
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,080
Oh, no.

1162
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,320
You know what?

1163
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,280
I don't know who to be.

1164
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,120
Close enough, I guess.

1165
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,640
I actually never watched Winks Club ever.

1166
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,120
Oh, really?

1167
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:47,840
Really?

1168
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,600
I played the PS2 game mainly.

1169
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,040
I don't think I watched it either.

1170
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,480
I read mostly the comic because we had the comics before.

1171
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,160
I'll try and be Flora.

1172
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,280
I don't know.

1173
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,160
I don't know.

1174
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,600
I found the perfect hairstyle.

1175
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,080
Let's go.

1176
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,080
Kind of.

1177
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,400
Okay.

1178
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:09,920
No.

1179
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,840
Wait, she's weird.

1180
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,160
Oh, no.

1181
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,560
Okay, hair.

1182
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,440
I found the perfect shirt.

1183
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,080
Oh my god.

1184
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,480
And then I need...

1185
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,400
Whiteish.

1186
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,000
Don't forget the wings.

1187
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,960
They all have wings.

1188
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,480
Yeah.

1189
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,920
Can't forget those.

1190
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:32,800
Yeah.

1191
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:34,640
Hmm.

1192
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,520
Why is it clipping?

1193
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,880
Anyone that doesn't clip?

1194
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,640
Oh, that one kind of.

1195
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:47,280
Oh.

1196
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,120
I want to run.

1197
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,080
There.

1198
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:53,520
I know.

1199
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,160
It's so annoying when you're like running out of time

1200
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,080
and you're trying to go to the next area,

1201
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,520
but you can't fucking run.

1202
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:04,880
I need a beanie somewhere.

1203
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,560
I need like arm bands.

1204
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:18,960
Oh, there they are.

1205
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,400
Oh, I hate that it's clipping.

1206
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,840
I wish it doesn't clip.

1207
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,160
Oh, no.

1208
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,640
I know.

1209
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,120
How am I supposed to unleash my full creativity?

1210
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,720
Do you guys like know stuff about layering

1211
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,120
Eldred's Aerial 2 or like color theory and stuff?

1212
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:35,280
No.

1213
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,560
Oh my god, color theory.

1214
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,520
I want to do the color theory.

1215
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,640
You sound so professional.

1216
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,000
I'm going to do the color theory thing so badly

1217
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,640
when you like...

1218
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,120
Okay.

1219
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,360
...someone to figure out all your colors.

1220
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,240
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

1221
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,200
Yeah.

1222
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,520
Or it's so cool.

1223
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,160
It would be cool, but I don't know if I believe those.

1224
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:55,600
I don't know.

1225
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,960
I can definitely like...

1226
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:58,640
I don't know.

1227
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,920
My wings are gone.

1228
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,400
What the heck?

1229
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:04,960
The clipping hurts.

1230
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,520
Where do I see the fairy?

1231
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,120
Is there a fairy wing specifically?

1232
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,080
Yes, there is.

1233
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,440
Oh, there is.

1234
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:13,760
Okay.

1235
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,360
Purple.

1236
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,120
Juice.

1237
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,600
Is there a headband anywhere?

1238
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,120
I don't see any.

1239
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:27,600
I hate the wings.

1240
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,720
Why did you find the fairy wings?

1241
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,200
Where are they?

1242
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:30,640
They're...

1243
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,520
What are they supposed to be?

1244
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,040
If you face away from the hair stuff,

1245
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:33,680
they're on the right.

1246
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,000
They're on the right?

1247
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,720
Sound them.

1248
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,320
Right?

1249
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:39,520
Where?

1250
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,640
When you face away from the hair dressing stuff, then...

1251
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:44,880
On the right.

1252
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,000
Away in the right.

1253
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,280
Um, like...

1254
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:48,480
If you...

1255
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:48,880
Wait, where?

1256
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,400
If you look at the Lana salon,

1257
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,480
and then go left from there,

1258
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,800
and keep going straight for a long time,

1259
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,000
and then they're on the right.

1260
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,760
Yeah, there you are.

1261
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,440
Holy crap, you walk so fast.

1262
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,320
Yeah, because I have to walk fast, thing.

1263
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,880
Oh, damn it.

1264
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,480
I see someone else that shows Stella,

1265
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,680
and they look so much better than me.

1266
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,000
Ah, fuck.

1267
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:12,480
No!

1268
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:12,960
It's like...

1269
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,560
I'm getting plain-ish, but...

1270
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,480
I don't know.

1271
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,480
Maybe there's a pattern,

1272
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,400
glittery pattern, or something.

1273
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,600
Plus bracelets.

1274
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,080
Oh.

1275
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,760
Kind of like yellow purse.

1276
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,360
What's that?

1277
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,000
Oh my god.

1278
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,640
I'm just trying to, like,

1279
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,600
copy a reference image.

1280
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,400
I'm so lost.

1281
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:28,720
Same.

1282
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:29,840
Just like...

1283
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,880
How do people get so creative

1284
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,680
with their designs

1285
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,960
while also looking like the character?

1286
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,760
You're like, I'm just trying to...

1287
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,040
I'm just trying to copy the reference image.

1288
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:37,680
Yeah.

1289
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,400
Yeah.

1290
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:38,960
I am.

1291
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,520
I'm just looking like the reference.

1292
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,320
I'm just trying to copy the reference image.

1293
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,280
It's like, they're so fashionable,

1294
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,080
but at the same time,

1295
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,920
it's exactly looks like the same.

1296
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,840
Yeah, like the same character.

1297
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,160
Yeah.

1298
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,560
Where do people get like...

1299
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,440
This is all I can do.

1300
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,240
Where do people get like,

1301
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,600
pretty headwear?

1302
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,760
And under here.

1303
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,120
Oh, this.

1304
00:52:59,120 --> 00:52:59,920
Oh my god.

1305
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,520
No armbands though.

1306
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,280
It looks okay.

1307
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:07,840
What is this?

1308
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,520
Oh, I have no idea.

1309
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:10,640
This one.

1310
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,040
I need a shiny, shiny heckin...

1311
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,320
Oh, I want to give up.

1312
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,840
I'm being humbled so hard.

1313
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,640
We're being humbled by the kids.

1314
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,800
Mine is just so simple,

1315
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,320
because it's the coolest one.

1316
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,600
Everything's glipping too, unfortunately.

1317
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,120
I just want to give up.

1318
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:31,840
I give up.

1319
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,720
I want to give up.

1320
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,360
It's the same.

1321
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,840
Wait, my skin is still yellow.

1322
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,400
Wait, wait, wait.

1323
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,040
Oh, shoot.

1324
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:41,920
No, I don't like this.

1325
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,880
I don't like this.

1326
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,200
Okay.

1327
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,480
I don't look like a cheeto.

1328
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:48,880
Come on.

1329
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,520
Why is nothing like what I'm supposed to?

1330
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,600
Oh my god.

1331
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,840
Okay, that's actually a cheeto.

1332
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,560
What the hell?

1333
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,680
Oh, man.

1334
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,040
That's a bloom.

1335
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,000
Two, three stars.

1336
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,400
That was pain.

1337
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,720
Three stars?

1338
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,920
That looks so good.

1339
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,480
Three stars.

1340
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:06,960
Black hair.

1341
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,240
Sapphire like me.

1342
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,080
Let's go.

1343
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:16,880
Mewsa.

1344
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,320
I can opt out by not wearing anything.

1345
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,440
I'm going naked, guys.

1346
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,480
You gotta pose.

1347
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,680
There you go.

1348
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,800
Let's go.

1349
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,320
That looks so cute.

1350
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,480
The spit out.

1351
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,760
Thank you.

1352
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,400
Thank you.

1353
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,440
Five stars.

1354
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,400
Yeah, five stars.

1355
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:42,960
Thank you.

1356
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,960
Looks like the smile, the snack that smiles back.

1357
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,680
Oh my god.

1358
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:50,960
Oh my god.

1359
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:53,680
Oh god.

1360
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,320
I panicked.

1361
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,040
I panicked.

1362
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,000
I don't know.

1363
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,600
That looks good.

1364
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,480
Yeah.

1365
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,320
I don't even know which one I picked.

1366
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,440
I just picked the first one.

1367
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,880
No, it looks like her.

1368
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,760
You did good.

1369
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,560
That's adorable.

1370
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,440
Body complete.

1371
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:15,520
Oh.

1372
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,080
Eggna.

1373
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,200
Oh, that's so good.

1374
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:19,920
Wait.

1375
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,880
That's so good.

1376
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,360
Looks so much like her.

1377
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,600
Yeah, I tried the closest possible,

1378
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,080
but the clothes are clipping though, the white stuff.

1379
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,200
It looks like sparkles kind of.

1380
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:31,680
It's okay.

1381
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,920
She's just sparkling.

1382
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,560
No, someone else did.

1383
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,480
It's nowhere near as good as mine.

1384
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,240
Two stars.

1385
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:42,960
Two stars.

1386
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,600
I went with one.

1387
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,640
My Stella comes first.

1388
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,160
Oh, that's pretty.

1389
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,840
That's so pretty.

1390
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,240
And they have different wings too.

1391
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,040
Damn it.

1392
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,400
See what there's wings from?

1393
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,000
These punks.

1394
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,040
These punks are spending money on the game.

1395
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,480
These kids.

1396
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,440
Paying for a free to play game.

1397
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,640
Where are they?

1398
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,640
Pathetic.

1399
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,880
Oh, you can fly?

1400
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,760
Whoa.

1401
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,400
What?

1402
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,680
How do you do that?

1403
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,200
I don't know.

1404
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,000
It looks.

1405
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,240
Oh, there's so many poses like pose one, two, three, four,

1406
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:24,880
five and stuff.

1407
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,080
Maybe one of those.

1408
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:26,640
Probably.

1409
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,040
Pick random buttons for the best.

1410
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:31,920
Ooh.

1411
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,560
Good.

1412
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,360
It's cute.

1413
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,880
This one's really cute too.

1414
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,880
Yeah, very red though, I think.

1415
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,240
Why do people do that?

1416
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,040
I don't know.

1417
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:39,840
I don't know.

1418
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,640
I don't know.

1419
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,440
I don't know.

1420
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,240
I don't know.

1421
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,040
I don't know.

1422
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:43,840
I don't know.

1423
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,440
Why do people do that?

1424
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,080
That's a character.

1425
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:48,640
Ready to pose.

1426
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,600
Oh, my gosh.

1427
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,480
The winners are got mugged.

1428
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,640
Let's go.

1429
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,520
Let's go.

1430
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,000
Let's go.

1431
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,480
Let's go.

1432
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,600
Yay.

1433
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,640
Oh, my gosh.

1434
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,120
With dominating the ranks.

1435
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:10,720
Oh, my gosh.

1436
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,040
I'm stuck.

1437
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,480
Why am I stuck in this pose?

1438
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,040
I know, right?

1439
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:13,920
It sticks to my pose.

1440
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,160
I know, right?

1441
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,040
It sticks to my pose.

1442
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,200
Because I've been taking the theme.

1443
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,240
Everyone's like, what the hell is this?

1444
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,040
Got mugged by previous?

1445
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:21,680
Oh, god.

1446
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,960
Yeah, the theme will be random now.

1447
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,480
Okay, okay.

1448
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:27,920
Yeah.

1449
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,480
I'm skipping so others have a triumph.

1450
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,040
I am.

1451
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,520
The poor kid's probably like, could she all stop?

1452
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,200
They're like, what are these boomers themes?

1453
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,120
Boomers.

1454
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,360
The team took over.

1455
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:41,760
Wait.

1456
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,120
She needs to spread leg one.

1457
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,880
Oh, boomer theme would be funny.

1458
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,360
Wait, I'm also stuck in the pose.

1459
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,000
How do I?

1460
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,360
I haven't got enough.

1461
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,880
Which one's the spread leg pose?

1462
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,360
Oh, it's like one of the numbered ones.

1463
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,560
Spread one, two, one, six, seven, eight.

1464
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,560
I've got enough to custom name it.

1465
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,280
Just sliding.

1466
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,480
Oh, you're 12-1.

1467
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:00,720
Yeah.

1468
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,560
Oh, my god.

1469
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,160
This looks so fucking wee.

1470
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,080
Spread eagle.

1471
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,360
Mythology.

1472
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:12,480
It's true.

1473
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,520
I don't know anything about mythology.

1474
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,400
Mythos, guys.

1475
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,560
Oh, that's true.

1476
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,320
Okay, I'm going to try going for Poseidon.

1477
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,880
I'm going to try Athena.

1478
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,840
We had to wait and do my pose and walking like this forever.

1479
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,840
Wait, I don't know how to do it.

1480
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,040
We had to wait and do my pose.

1481
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,960
Oh, well, I'm just going to have to walk like this.

1482
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,160
Okay, there you go.

1483
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,440
Okay, okay, okay.

1484
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,160
Wait, where am I?

1485
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:42,560
Oh, okay.

1486
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,240
Oh, man.

1487
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,280
That's actually really hard.

1488
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,600
Oh, actually, no, no, no, no.

1489
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,000
I can't undo.

1490
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,480
I'm walking like this forever.

1491
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,280
You just choose a different one,

1492
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,880
and then you can like click on it and then unclick.

1493
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,320
Oh, okay, thank you.

1494
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,360
Yeah, thank you so much.

1495
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,160
Thank you, thank you.

1496
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,520
Oh, god.

1497
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,080
I'm going to do...

1498
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,440
We're still dressed.

1499
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,400
I'm dressed.

1500
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:08,640
No.

1501
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,240
Oh, no.

1502
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,000
When I don't have a reference to coffee from,

1503
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,960
I get so uncreated.

1504
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,280
I know you too.

1505
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,880
That's why you always get a reference.

1506
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,640
I did not have a tight dress.

1507
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,520
This is the only thing I can do.

1508
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,920
It kicked me out of my shirt.

1509
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:30,800
Buy it.

1510
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,920
Oh, lame.

1511
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:33,760
Lame.

1512
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,520
Lame's house.

1513
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,240
Oh, expensive.

1514
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:36,960
So lame.

1515
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,200
This one?

1516
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:42,800
Hmm.

1517
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,520
Oh, never mind.

1518
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,160
That's ugly.

1519
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:45,760
I'll leave it behind.

1520
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,400
What's this?

1521
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,360
Where's the skirt?

1522
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,320
Are there skirts?

1523
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,240
Maybe this one?

1524
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,080
I don't have money.

1525
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,920
Why is it so expensive?

1526
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,360
$4,000?

1527
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:02,240
$5,000 for the dress?

1528
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,080
Right?

1529
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,960
This one was like $3,000.

1530
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,680
I'm like, why?

1531
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,080
Why is it so expensive?

1532
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:10,800
Oh, my God.

1533
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,800
Inflation even hit roblox.

1534
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:15,840
Darn inflation.

1535
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,800
Where is the skirt?

1536
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,880
This one's sparkly.

1537
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:29,680
All right.

1538
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,360
And then what should I do for top?

1539
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:33,840
I think.

1540
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,000
What about this one?

1541
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,120
Oh, this one's free.

1542
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:43,920
Okay.

1543
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:44,480
Never mind.

1544
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,200
It's not free.

1545
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,840
They trick you and then they show you the picture of like,

1546
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,960
would you like to purchase?

1547
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:52,720
Right?

1548
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,800
I feel so lame.

1549
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,560
How do you make this like unique?

1550
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,160
Oh, not like this.

1551
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:02,720
Not like this.

1552
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,920
Well, you can choose patterns.

1553
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,120
Oh, you can just.

1554
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:05,520
Yeah.

1555
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,080
Yeah.

1556
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:06,640
What?

1557
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,760
I have no clue.

1558
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,520
Damn.

1559
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,000
Okay.

1560
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,680
Whoa.

1561
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:12,640
There's a lot too.

1562
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,160
Oh, this is so much more helpful.

1563
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:16,640
Okay.

1564
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,120
Oh, okay.

1565
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:21,520
Okay.

1566
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,360
How do I?

1567
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:28,960
Never mind.

1568
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,680
Actually, how do I get this off of me there?

1569
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,120
I'm going to choose a pattern.

1570
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:35,520
Okay.

1571
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:35,840
Okay.

1572
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,400
See shows.

1573
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,680
Or like this one.

1574
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,160
And then the top can be seashells.

1575
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,560
Fuck yeah.

1576
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:46,800
Okay.

1577
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:47,840
Now I look a little bit.

1578
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,680
Yeah, I think we're cooking.

1579
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,280
We're cooking.

1580
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,600
Kind of.

1581
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,240
We're trying to cook.

1582
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,000
We're attempting to cook.

1583
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,240
It's like.

1584
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:00,960
Yeah, we're attempting.

1585
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:01,760
We're attempting.

1586
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,160
Yeah.

1587
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,760
Trying to make some kind of like microwave meal.

1588
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:07,600
Out of the freezer.

1589
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,120
Straight up.

1590
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,360
Okay.

1591
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,320
I think I'm done.

1592
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:15,600
I need a head fan for the head.

1593
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,600
Mine looks nothing like mythology.

1594
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,840
I'm starting to realize.

1595
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,440
Mine looks like a beach girl.

1596
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:23,840
Fuck.

1597
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:25,520
Fuck.

1598
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,360
Where's the flowers?

1599
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,320
Shit.

1600
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:30,800
All right.

1601
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,560
Cooking on a budget.

1602
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:32,800
Yeah.

1603
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,800
Cooking on a budget.

1604
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,520
Cooking some ramen or something.

1605
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,000
Yeah.

1606
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,520
That's what we're cooking.

1607
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,560
Oh, that looks better.

1608
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:44,800
Okay.

1609
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,320
There you go.

1610
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,320
That's cute.

1611
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:55,360
Okay.

1612
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:00,000
Poseidon's probably rich and has lots of jewelry.

1613
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,000
Like they don't.

1614
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,320
Usually they all have tons of jewelry on, right?

1615
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:07,280
Yeah.

1616
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:07,600
Yeah.

1617
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,120
Like yeah.

1618
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,400
Slap and jewelry on.

1619
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,160
Oh, what the frick?

1620
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:17,840
Oh, there's some.

1621
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,120
Mermaid swimming outside.

1622
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,160
What's underneath?

1623
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:20,800
There is.

1624
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,960
Oh, that mermaid's going to win.

1625
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,320
How did they get out of there?

1626
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,800
Hey, where'd you get the mermaid?

1627
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,360
What the?

1628
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,240
Oh my god.

1629
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,280
VIP, I guess.

1630
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,400
Yeah.

1631
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:30,880
For sure.

1632
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,880
Oh, there's gloves down here.

1633
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:33,280
I didn't.

1634
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:33,840
There's socks.

1635
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,720
Whoa.

1636
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,280
What the hell?

1637
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,640
Do you see the green mermaid?

1638
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:37,840
Yeah.

1639
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,320
Yeah.

1640
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,120
It's wild.

1641
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,160
Oh, shit.

1642
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,120
There's only three seconds left.

1643
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:41,840
I don't have shoes.

1644
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,960
Oh, damn it.

1645
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,000
Oh, I just.

1646
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,480
I tried.

1647
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,680
I'm going to ask her from Okami.

1648
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,040
She's a wolf goddess.

1649
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,960
So I have like ears on my hood and stuff.

1650
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:53,840
I like it.

1651
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:55,920
I like it too.

1652
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,120
It works.

1653
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:58,080
Oh, there's a code.

1654
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,000
Use code mermaid for tail.

1655
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,480
Where do I put the code?

1656
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,600
Is that the code?

1657
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,840
Is that the affiliate code for Roblox?

1658
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,160
Wait.

1659
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:07,440
Imagine.

1660
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,480
There's a saddle thing.

1661
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:08,960
Wow.

1662
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:09,360
That's so cute.

1663
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,000
Is it cute?

1664
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:10,720
I even.

1665
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,600
Yes.

1666
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,160
I tried.

1667
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:12,720
Cute.

1668
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,120
High five.

1669
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:14,960
That's so cute.

1670
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,720
She must have fish mouth.

1671
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,520
The fish mouth.

1672
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,120
Oh, there's a code when voting ends.

1673
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,360
The code we shall do.

1674
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:25,760
Okay.

1675
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,080
Okay.

1676
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:26,400
Okay.

1677
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,720
Oh, I need a bigger giant boots to become Aphrodite.

1678
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,360
Who is it?

1679
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,000
So pretty.

1680
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,200
That's so pretty.

1681
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,080
It lacked in the boob department, but that's fine.

1682
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,240
Wait.

1683
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:40,720
Who is it?

1684
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,080
Aphrodite.

1685
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,960
Oh, wow.

1686
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:46,960
Five stars.

1687
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,960
Oh, you guys went all out.

1688
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:51,680
What the heck?

1689
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,560
That looks really good.

1690
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:57,520
Athena.

1691
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:58,720
Yeah.

1692
01:04:59,200 --> 01:04:59,760
That's really good.

1693
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,760
Oh, I forgot to pose.

1694
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,080
Oh, mermaids.

1695
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,280
She went in for mermaids.

1696
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,520
Why is she bald?

1697
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,440
This is the purest form of mermaids.

1698
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,560
They are mermaids, I guess.

1699
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:22,400
Exactly.

1700
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:23,760
I mean, it does.

1701
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,400
It's siren.

1702
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,120
Oh, my God.

1703
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,600
Oh, that is so good.

1704
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,960
That is so pretty.

1705
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,360
It's crazy.

1706
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,880
I'll have to vote four stars for that.

1707
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,440
That's good.

1708
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,040
We got a blend in, guys.

1709
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:47,760
We got a blend in.

1710
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:50,800
What is this?

1711
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,160
Oh.

1712
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,200
Oh, that's true.

1713
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:56,720
No.

1714
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:57,200
Once.

1715
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,640
I don't really know how.

1716
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:58,880
Lay.

1717
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,640
And serve with a logical name here.

1718
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:06,960
Oh, God.

1719
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:07,680
Not me.

1720
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,440
Oh, that looks like a fancy lady.

1721
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,520
Yeah, that's like a fancy lady.

1722
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,360
Slender woman.

1723
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,640
That's not mythology.

1724
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,120
What?

1725
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:23,680
It's not.

1726
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,120
Oh, God.

1727
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,520
Michael Jackson.

1728
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,040
Yeah, I was saying the same thing.

1729
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,680
Does Kyla look like that?

1730
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,680
That is, um, what's she?

1731
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,320
The Yeti.

1732
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,480
The Abominable Snowman.

1733
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,120
Are Yeti's mythology?

1734
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,280
I don't know.

1735
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:43,360
I don't think so.

1736
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,640
The mythology is not God's.

1737
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:50,240
I think Yeti would be like what you call the monsters.

1738
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,200
Let me find my look.

1739
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:51,760
I don't know.

1740
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,760
That's cool.

1741
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,240
You won against the freaking mermaid.

1742
01:06:58,960 --> 01:06:59,280
Yeah.

1743
01:06:59,280 --> 01:06:59,840
Oh, yeah.

1744
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:00,800
So where's the code?

1745
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,000
It says after voting.

1746
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,760
Yeah, there's the code.

1747
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,320
Google dressed him.

1748
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:06,560
Where?

1749
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,560
Where's the code?

1750
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,920
Wait, where?

1751
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:12,960
On the bottom left?

1752
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:13,920
No.

1753
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:14,640
Mm.

1754
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,200
It says code.

1755
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:15,520
Oh, yeah.

1756
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,080
I found it.

1757
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:16,960
It says invalid.

1758
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,400
How was the spelling again?

1759
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,200
I was looking at the code.

1760
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,080
M.

1761
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,720
It was M3R.

1762
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,280
Invalid code.

1763
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,240
It's an ID.

1764
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,600
Something like that.

1765
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,800
It's invalid code.

1766
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,240
I got invalid code, too.

1767
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,040
This is not working.

1768
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:31,680
It's invalid.

1769
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,040
It's invalid.

1770
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,760
Wait, is it like only, it only works once?

1771
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:37,760
Oh, me?

1772
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,160
Oh.

1773
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,720
Hey, I so-

1774
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,000
What can I get in the room?

1775
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,160
I'm a streamer.

1776
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,600
Oh, me.

1777
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,960
They're in stream chat.

1778
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,000
Who's stream chat?

1779
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,320
Someone's in stream chat?

1780
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,440
Oh, of mine.

1781
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,880
Oh, you can get cute shit.

1782
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:53,840
Oh, my gosh.

1783
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,280
Wait, you guys want me to copy pasta?

1784
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,400
It's a lot, though.

1785
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:56,800
Yes?

1786
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,040
Yeah.

1787
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:58,880
Okay, it's a lot.

1788
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,600
Let's see.

1789
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,160
Or I'll just-

1790
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,880
I'll screenshot and then I'll send to you guys.

1791
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:03,760
Oh, I got a cute-

1792
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,960
It's like a cute bear.

1793
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,280
It's like a lot of outfits.

1794
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,040
Wait, how do these codes work?

1795
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,880
How do people just get codes?

1796
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:11,440
I know, right?

1797
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:11,680
Yeah.

1798
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:13,360
I'm just kidding.

1799
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,280
Wait, what's the theme?

1800
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,080
Prince or princess?

1801
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:16,560
Oh, my gosh.

1802
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,360
I'm already waiting.

1803
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,000
I'm just kidding.

1804
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,680
Thank you for all the codes.

1805
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:20,080
Thank you.

1806
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:20,560
Thank you.

1807
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,120
Thank you.

1808
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,640
Wow, yeah, so cute.

1809
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,840
Oh, you can do them all.

1810
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,360
It's time to be a princess.

1811
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,400
See, princess.

1812
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,160
Well, we can't use guys' clothes, right?

1813
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:30,960
So-

1814
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,840
If you want to change to a guy, then you can't-

1815
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,520
How do I change to a guy?

1816
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,000
How do I-

1817
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,640
Well, it's like in the back at the men area.

1818
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,080
Oh, you want to change your-

1819
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,280
Yes, I'm going to be a-

1820
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,080
Wow!

1821
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:44,720
You're a man?

1822
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:46,480
Yeah.

1823
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,680
I'm going to be the only man.

1824
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,000
Is there a crown?

1825
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,360
A man?

1826
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:52,560
A stinky bug.

1827
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,200
A man's tree?

1828
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,040
Is that a boy's smell?

1829
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:57,520
Oh, my gosh.

1830
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,720
That boy's smell.

1831
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,480
Is that a boy's smell?

1832
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,520
But it's a prince.

1833
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,240
It's a prince, you smell.

1834
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,920
That's what you're smelling.

1835
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,360
I am not just a boy.

1836
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,480
I am a prince.

1837
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,200
I am a prince.

1838
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,000
Prince.

1839
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,280
Not like the other boys.

1840
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:19,120
There's not really a lot of men options.

1841
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:19,680
Is there?

1842
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,760
Hmm.

1843
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,960
What's the prettiest dress I don't have to go into depth for?

1844
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,000
Can I wear the girl clothes?

1845
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:29,600
I don't think so.

1846
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:31,840
I can wear them.

1847
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,560
6,000!

1848
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,000
You can't wait.

1849
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,680
So men can wear women's clothes.

1850
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:36,160
Only some stuff.

1851
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,360
Only some stuff.

1852
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,800
Only some stuff.

1853
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:39,760
Not all of them.

1854
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,040
Damn.

1855
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,240
Okay.

1856
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,000
It's like expensive.

1857
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,760
All the dresses are expensive.

1858
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:46,240
Like-

1859
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:50,800
This is going to be rough.

1860
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,240
It's rough out here for the boys.

1861
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:52,800
What the hell?

1862
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:00,320
Oh, man.

1863
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,880
What's the most royal color?

1864
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,320
They know, right?

1865
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,800
Can I wear like any of these shoes?

1866
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,440
What the fuck?

1867
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,440
Put on.

1868
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,360
I have to wear ugly fucking sneakers.

1869
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,880
Maybe it was a bad idea to choose to be a dude.

1870
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:21,360
It's like three minutes to be a girl again.

1871
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,240
No, I'm sticking to my choice.

1872
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,000
I'm sticking to it.

1873
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,080
The prettiest princess can marry the prince.

1874
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,280
I'm just going to be watery.

1875
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:41,920
Watery?

1876
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:43,360
Or like a-

1877
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,520
Oh, a lot.

1878
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,160
A lottery.

1879
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:46,800
A lottery.

1880
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,760
I also understood watery.

1881
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:48,240
Watery.

1882
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:49,520
Watery?

1883
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,280
Colors, no.

1884
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,400
I spent the most time with the hair trying to change the color.

1885
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,160
I think it's makeup for me.

1886
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:05,840
Can't decide.

1887
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,520
Okay, dress, dress, dress, dress.

1888
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,160
Are there any free dresses that are not-

1889
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,800
I- I- I- I- I believe 700, I guess.

1890
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,960
Oh god, I've got this thing blocking my view.

1891
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,000
I actually can't see.

1892
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,120
It's like five robots.

1893
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:23,920
I'm like, I don't wanna!

1894
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:27,760
Okay.

1895
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,440
Please tell me I can wear girl hair.

1896
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,640
Oh, this is so ugly.

1897
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,680
All my layers back on.

1898
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,920
Today I learned I am not a princess.

1899
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,440
I am not a prince either.

1900
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:53,440
I tried.

1901
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,640
Oh god, it's getting worse.

1902
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,120
Oh my god, these faces are so funny.

1903
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,960
Why don't any of them have noses?

1904
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,920
There's only like three that have noses.

1905
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,200
No nose.

1906
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:07,840
Nobody knows.

1907
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,200
Nobody knows.

1908
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,040
Oh, I got you.

1909
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:11,520
I got you.

1910
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,960
Why don't you put on the dress?

1911
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:13,280
Oh no.

1912
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:15,920
No time, no time, no time, no time.

1913
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,200
There's no hacking time.

1914
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,240
Oh, that's not a princess dress.

1915
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,040
Never mind a board.

1916
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,120
Okay, wait, hold on.

1917
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,560
I have to go to the bathroom really bad.

1918
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,360
I'll be right back.

1919
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,280
Tell me if I win.

1920
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:30,960
All right.

1921
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:31,760
All right, go ahead.

1922
01:15:44,160 --> 01:16:13,680
You look gorgeous, by the way.

1923
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:16,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like the most the most the sexiest prince ever.

1924
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,840
That's so funny.

1925
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,160
Oh, I just got a friend request.

1926
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,160
What?

1927
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,480
You out here making friends on Ruthless.

1928
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,520
Let's go.

1929
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,720
I'm getting all the babes by dressing up like this.

1930
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,160
Oh, this one's pretty.

1931
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,560
Oh man, I haven't been voting for any of them.

1932
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:43,760
I've not been.

1933
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:45,520
The good ones.

1934
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:49,040
This isn't princess sign.

1935
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,480
How about princess?

1936
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,880
That's not very princess like.

1937
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,520
What's that?

1938
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:59,520
It's not princess like or etiquette.

1939
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,440
No princess etiquette.

1940
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,320
I don't know how to write etiquette.

1941
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,840
Wait, that crown attack.

1942
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,080
Oh god, no princess etiquette.

1943
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,200
Oh, geez.

1944
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,640
That crown is.

1945
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,040
Wow, look at them.

1946
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,480
It's kind of mermaidy, but then how did they do the crown?

1947
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:24,080
Codes.

1948
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,360
It's Bambicodes now.

1949
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,200
Let's check the code.

1950
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,400
Oh, that's cute.

1951
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,040
Oh, that's cute.

1952
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:31,760
Oh, that's cute.

1953
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,960
That's cute.

1954
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:33,360
Yeah.

1955
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:34,480
Oh, wait.

1956
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,400
Are I code good?

1957
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,200
Was there another dude?

1958
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,000
Okay, code.

1959
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:39,680
Yeah, I was.

1960
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,320
Oh my god.

1961
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,680
He stole my spotlight.

1962
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:43,200
That's okay.

1963
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,240
You got the friend request.

1964
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:44,800
Not him.

1965
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,440
Oh my god.

1966
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,240
So, merm.

1967
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,920
Oh yeah, you get it.

1968
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:50,640
Oh my gosh.

1969
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:55,040
Oh, that's so pretty.

1970
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:56,480
Oh my gosh, guys.

1971
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:57,280
Okay, what else we got?

1972
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,520
Fashion.

1973
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,240
Lana.

1974
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:00,720
Oh, that's cute.

1975
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:01,840
Oh, that's cute.

1976
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:02,480
That's cute.

1977
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:04,800
Let's see what.

1978
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:06,960
Love boots.

1979
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:08,480
Hideo.

1980
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:09,840
Invalid.

1981
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,400
What do you mean?

1982
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,360
Oh, I mean.

1983
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,080
Bella.

1984
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,360
Where do we see this then?

1985
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:15,760
If we.

1986
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,920
Wait, so it's not just once per use?

1987
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:24,800
You can get it.

1988
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,040
Oh, where do we?

1989
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,800
Where do we find it somewhere?

1990
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:29,760
Oh my god.

1991
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,400
Look at the cat.

1992
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,240
Actually, bunny.

1993
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,120
Oh, bunny.

1994
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,240
That's so cute.

1995
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:36,400
Good.

1996
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,040
This one work.

1997
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:38,720
Bella.

1998
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,720
I'll vote for the next theme.

1999
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,440
Cowboy.

2000
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:44,320
No, game night.

2001
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:44,880
Let's go.

2002
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,480
Oh, White 2K is nice, too.

2003
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,360
Game night.

2004
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,640
I went for cowboy.

2005
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,640
A lot of people use cowboys or white 2K.

2006
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,240
What's white 2K?

2007
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,160
What's that?

2008
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:57,680
3,000, like old school, like mean girls.

2009
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,240
Yeah.

2010
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:58,720
Oh.

2011
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,040
Some of the kids own.

2012
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,240
I went up the kids now.

2013
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,680
Lots of ribbons, I think, ish.

2014
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:08,400
Or something.

2015
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,520
We're talking.

2016
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:10,320
Yeah.

2017
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:10,800
Right.

2018
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,080
Oh, that would be cute.

2019
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,280
Wait, what was the theme?

2020
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,800
I didn't see it either.

2021
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,000
I thought it was white 2K, I think.

2022
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:19,200
Yeah.

2023
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,080
Yeah, white 2K.

2024
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:20,320
Awesome.

2025
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,360
They looked that up.

2026
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,080
White 2K.

2027
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:23,280
Oh, yeah.

2028
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:23,920
Oh, that.

2029
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,640
OK, OK, OK.

2030
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,360
Got it.

2031
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,400
Let's do this.

2032
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,760
What kind of hair do they have, though?

2033
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,000
Kind of like buns, braids.

2034
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,400
White 2K.

2035
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,840
Like, in this ish.

2036
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,560
Yeah.

2037
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,280
Yeah.

2038
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,240
White 2K.

2039
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,560
OK, fashion.

2040
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,240
I'm going to look up some references.

2041
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,000
Yeah, that's fine.

2042
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,440
I'm looking at myself, too.

2043
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,320
I have a reference.

2044
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:45,280
All right.

2045
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,720
I don't want to be a man anymore.

2046
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:49,520
I change my mind.

2047
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,240
I give up being a man.

2048
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,040
I don't want to do it.

2049
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,040
It's too hard.

2050
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,160
They got no options.

2051
01:19:58,960 --> 01:19:59,440
Oh.

2052
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,880
This one definitely.

2053
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,320
I need a sweater.

2054
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,000
This is cool.

2055
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,960
So where do we find the ones we just unlocked, too?

2056
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:15,600
I'm not sure.

2057
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,960
I just check on the code area.

2058
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:17,920
You can get them up.

2059
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,400
They're coming only in the VIP room.

2060
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,240
Oh, is it only in the VIP room?

2061
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:22,800
I don't know.

2062
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,320
No, you just click on the codes

2063
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,440
and then I actually click on the item.

2064
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:25,840
Oh, yeah.

2065
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,200
You go to the code place.

2066
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,520
It's actually a picture.

2067
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,720
Oh, oh, I remember.

2068
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,600
Hey, that's so cute.

2069
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:32,880
I love it.

2070
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:34,480
Whoa.

2071
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:36,400
Whoa.

2072
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:38,240
Whoa.

2073
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:38,720
Okay.

2074
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:44,480
I need some low-rise hiking trousers

2075
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,520
and some gummy shoes.

2076
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,000
Let's go.

2077
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,840
I got tank tops and stuff, right?

2078
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,120
Yeah, yeah.

2079
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,040
Tank tops are pretty Y2K, I think.

2080
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:00,560
I don't know.

2081
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,160
Hmm.

2082
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:06,880
Oh, that's hard.

2083
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,880
And then I need...

2084
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,640
They're too young to know Y2K?

2085
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,680
I think they'll know.

2086
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,440
I don't know.

2087
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,560
It's very popular lately, I think.

2088
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,840
Yeah, the fashion kind of came back.

2089
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,200
Mm-hmm.

2090
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:25,680
And stuff.

2091
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,640
What about accessories?

2092
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,240
Do they have, like, crazy accessories?

2093
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:28,480
Yeah, yeah.

2094
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,920
You can have Y2K flip phone.

2095
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:30,880
Let's go.

2096
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,920
Oh, yeah, the flip phone.

2097
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,600
Hey, shoes.

2098
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,320
What shoes?

2099
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,040
Do they have any shoes?

2100
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,920
I definitely look the mean girl part.

2101
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:43,200
Yeah.

2102
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,560
Oh, these shoes look better.

2103
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:51,680
Damn it.

2104
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,560
Oh, yeah, I'll change the shoe.

2105
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:57,120
The butt is so pronounced on this game.

2106
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,440
What's so pronounced?

2107
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,480
The butt.

2108
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,040
The butt?

2109
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:01,600
The butt.

2110
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,120
The butt is so pronounced.

2111
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:03,680
It's very sensitive.

2112
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,120
You don't judge me, but she...

2113
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:08,960
You get it wrong.

2114
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,080
Laffy has to be Gat.

2115
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:10,640
The Gat.

2116
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:11,920
The Gat.

2117
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:12,720
Sorry, Gat.

2118
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:13,920
So skibbity toilet.

2119
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:14,240
Wow.

2120
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:15,360
Yeah, so she's like, Gat.

2121
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,240
Very demurr, very cutesy.

2122
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,360
Did you guys see the demurr thing?

2123
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,440
It's everywhere since yesterday.

2124
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,280
I don't get it.

2125
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,080
You don't get it?

2126
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,920
I mean, I saw like the theme or like everyone's like,

2127
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:32,400
it's from the original like, oh, so demurr.

2128
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,800
Yeah, you see how I do my makeup for work.

2129
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,400
Yeah, this is so considerate.

2130
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,200
So demurr.

2131
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,640
Yeah, very cutesy.

2132
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,440
Very cutesy.

2133
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,920
I don't wear a green cut crease to work.

2134
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:52,880
I'm noticing that I don't know anything about colors.

2135
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,720
Like, I don't know how to match colors at all.

2136
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,720
Yeah, me neither.

2137
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,240
I don't...

2138
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:00,400
I'm not a fashionable person in real life.

2139
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,560
Maybe this bank.

2140
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:05,600
Oh, this is cute.

2141
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:07,440
Okay.

2142
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:14,960
Um, I just copied a picture from Pinterest, to be honest.

2143
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:15,760
Oh, I don't know.

2144
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:16,240
I don't know.

2145
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,920
Um, where are some other...

2146
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,040
What are other accessories?

2147
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,200
Wait, would it be like this?

2148
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,040
This hanging bangle?

2149
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:27,440
I don't know.

2150
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:28,880
How do I...

2151
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:29,040
How do I...

2152
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,400
How are people outside?

2153
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:30,800
What are they...

2154
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,200
Yeah, there's someone dancing around outside.

2155
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:33,760
I don't know.

2156
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,560
There's someone dancing around outside.

2157
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:45,360
Oh, yeah, I'm getting there.

2158
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,000
Oh, there's one minute left.

2159
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,120
I'm looking for Y2K jewelry.

2160
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:55,760
Is this Y2K?

2161
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:56,640
What is Y2K?

2162
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,880
Yeah, I don't know about the jewelry, too.

2163
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,920
I just bought a lot of jewelry because I think they're very...

2164
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,560
Yes, I think they're very jewelry-y, right?

2165
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,280
Are you ready?

2166
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,320
Yeah, I think so, too.

2167
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,320
That's why I put, like, two or three drawers.

2168
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,080
Ohio Sigmund, baby Gronk.

2169
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,000
Oh, what?

2170
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,360
Is that Y2K to you?

2171
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,200
Okay.

2172
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,800
Kind of looks like Y2K, I think.

2173
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,160
Oh, my God.

2174
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,920
My chat gets auto-translated to German

2175
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,080
and there's just some stuff that doesn't make any sense in there.

2176
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,440
I have no idea what people are saying.

2177
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,320
Michael, don't leave me here!

2178
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:30,800
Michael!

2179
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:33,440
That's what they're saying.

2180
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:34,560
Oh, wait.

2181
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,920
And the girl is trying to show the baddie nays?

2182
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:38,240
What?

2183
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,120
Wait, what is this?

2184
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,120
It says no one wants baddie nails.

2185
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:44,320
What?

2186
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,680
Oh, what?

2187
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:46,480
That's what they said.

2188
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,440
The baddie nails.

2189
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,520
I forgot to add nails to my character.

2190
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,200
Wow, this is kind of nice.

2191
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:51,680
Hello?

2192
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:52,160
Hello?

2193
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,880
And those wigs!

2194
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,280
Oh, yeah, you like those?

2195
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,320
Those wigs.

2196
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,080
That looks Y2K.

2197
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:00,480
Yeah.

2198
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,520
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

2199
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,400
Oh, my God.

2200
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,200
And Michael Jackson.

2201
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:04,480
Wait.

2202
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,320
Click on the positive sign next to a lot.

2203
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,360
What's the positive sign?

2204
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,000
The positive sign.

2205
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,720
Oh, that's me!

2206
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,000
Hey, yo!

2207
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:12,640
That's yo!

2208
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:13,200
Yo!

2209
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:13,760
The baddie.

2210
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:14,480
I love you.

2211
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:15,200
Hey, let's go.

2212
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:18,960
Oh, we've only been in the green team.

2213
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,320
That's why it's so fancy.

2214
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,280
Look, the background is calling us breasts.

2215
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,480
You're called Karen-ish.

2216
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:26,960
Oh, my God.

2217
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:27,520
Yeah.

2218
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,200
Excuse me!

2219
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:31,360
You look good.

2220
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,560
This is very like the case.

2221
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,160
Oh, the shirt.

2222
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,720
I love it.

2223
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,080
That's really good.

2224
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,040
I love the hair.

2225
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,160
I really feel it.

2226
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,800
It's so adorable.

2227
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:44,320
You see?

2228
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:48,720
Bop-bop, bop-bop.

2229
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,360
Oh, let's go.

2230
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,400
I love the teddy bear necklace.

2231
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,040
Over the shirt.

2232
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,000
Oh, my God.

2233
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:56,800
That's annoying.

2234
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,680
You guys did so good with the Y2K theme.

2235
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,320
What the hell?

2236
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:04,400
Oh, the necklace is so cute, too.

2237
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:04,880
Oh, my God.

2238
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,640
You said the necklace was so cute.

2239
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,760
This is kind of like...

2240
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:16,640
It's cute.

2241
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,040
It's cute.

2242
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:18,480
It is cute.

2243
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:18,960
It is cute.

2244
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:19,760
The nails are cute.

2245
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:20,960
Elf's way 2K.

2246
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:21,840
Oh, my God.

2247
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,040
Wow, what's the move?

2248
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,080
I like that.

2249
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,200
I like that dance move.

2250
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,960
Wait, it looks like color on it.

2251
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:29,840
Wait, what did they say?

2252
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,280
The second to last chat message?

2253
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:31,680
What's that?

2254
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,200
Which one?

2255
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:33,920
Karin-ish.

2256
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:34,960
It looks Karin-ish.

2257
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,320
Someone called me Karin-ish.

2258
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:37,680
Who was that?

2259
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:38,880
Someone called Indifference.

2260
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:40,720
Yeah, Indifference.

2261
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,280
Since I don't think anyone here knows what Y2K is.

2262
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:45,920
Yeah.

2263
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:47,760
What?

2264
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,960
They just called you guys old in like five languages.

2265
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,080
Oh, God.

2266
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:56,640
It's so funny.

2267
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:01,040
If you want bad e-nails, follow me next round.

2268
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:03,120
Okay, thank you.

2269
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:04,800
How do you do that?

2270
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:06,880
How do you do the bad e-nails?

2271
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,560
There's a nailed studio.

2272
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,680
Yeah, there's a nailed studio.

2273
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2274
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,520
Oh, okay, okay.

2275
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:12,560
And you can get different nails.

2276
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,160
Oh, that one's so cute, too.

2277
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,760
Oh, this gives us such...

2278
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:16,560
I could wear this.

2279
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,000
Right?

2280
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,840
Yeah, brats, exactly.

2281
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:20,400
Yeah.

2282
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,240
Like brats, it'd be perfect.

2283
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:23,680
Yeah.

2284
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,440
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

2285
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:32,000
Oh, no.

2286
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,200
Oh, music kind of slaps, too.

2287
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,400
Oh, I forgot they're supposed to be turned it off.

2288
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,160
They play like copyrighted music, by the way.

2289
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:41,120
Oh, really?

2290
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,080
Oh, my God.

2291
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:42,800
Unless...

2292
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,360
Yeah, so if you have it on stream, be careful.

2293
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:46,880
Oh, really?

2294
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,080
Yeah, it's copyrighted.

2295
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,200
Um, um, um...

2296
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:50,720
There.

2297
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,640
I turned mine on so I could hear it well.

2298
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:53,520
I'd be buying them.

2299
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:53,920
I didn't text.

2300
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,240
Let's go.

2301
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:57,360
I can't wait to get them.

2302
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,480
I'm so sick of it.

2303
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,280
That's cute.

2304
01:27:59,280 --> 01:27:59,920
That's cute.

2305
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:00,400
I love it.

2306
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,120
They're all matchy.

2307
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,200
Yay!

2308
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,000
Yay!

2309
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:04,400
Noice.

2310
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,120
Oh, my God.

2311
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:07,920
All right, more codes.

2312
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,120
I'm typing more stuff.

2313
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:09,760
Yeah.

2314
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,480
More codes.

2315
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:11,280
I forgot.

2316
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:11,840
So many.

2317
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,440
How do you guys get these codes?

2318
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,360
Yeah, where did you find these?

2319
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,480
I think it's on the other side.

2320
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,640
If the other is not lineable.

2321
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,120
Some of them are invalid, I think.

2322
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,320
Maybe it's, like, expired.

2323
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:23,600
Maybe.

2324
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:26,720
Let's see.

2325
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:27,280
Codes.

2326
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:29,360
Oh, that's cute.

2327
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,400
I like that one.

2328
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:31,840
It's cute.

2329
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:32,640
They're love-less.

2330
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,600
Let me...

2331
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,000
It's...

2332
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:35,280
Just...

2333
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,800
Oh, pretty.

2334
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:37,600
They're call-less.

2335
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,560
She's funny.

2336
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,120
Call-less.

2337
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,440
I think I got everything.

2338
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:42,560
Wow.

2339
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,640
Oh, the creek hat is so cute.

2340
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:45,120
Right?

2341
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:45,920
I like it, too.

2342
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,040
We definitely get that, too.

2343
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,520
Oh, I think that was a few things.

2344
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:51,920
Oops.

2345
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,640
All right, all right.

2346
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:55,520
Wow, so cute.

2347
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:57,520
Fashion.

2348
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,320
Oh, that's so cute.

2349
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:02,320
Ashley Bunny.

2350
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,480
Ashley.

2351
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,440
And then...

2352
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,000
Oh, my God.

2353
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,800
I can't tell Ashley Bunny.

2354
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,040
It was a theme.

2355
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:11,920
Oh, that's so cute.

2356
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:12,960
What's this one?

2357
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,080
Oh, fancy.

2358
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:14,880
Oh, you can see myself.

2359
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:15,440
Oh, Vibes.

2360
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,240
What the heck's 24?

2361
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:17,680
What do people wear in 2014?

2362
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,080
What's 2014, Vibes?

2363
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:20,960
I'm googling it now.

2364
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,080
What is it?

2365
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,840
2014 has a volume.

2366
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:24,800
Maybe like Emo?

2367
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,360
Is that Emo?

2368
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,920
When I said 2014, everything's like normal.

2369
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:30,960
Or maybe like Disney.

2370
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,760
I think maybe Disney stuff with lots of layering.

2371
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:35,200
That's what I think, baby.

2372
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,880
Not according to Google.

2373
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:37,360
It's like...

2374
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,320
Yeah, it's so different.

2375
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:41,120
I see faddles or Emo, too.

2376
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,560
And I guess like ripped jeans.

2377
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,840
Scarps.

2378
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:44,560
Jeans.

2379
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:46,400
Shorts.

2380
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,600
Oh, underwear, I guess.

2381
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,280
That's what you were saying.

2382
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,400
Oh, I don't know.

2383
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,120
I've over-asked.

2384
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:55,520
I don't know.

2385
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:57,040
It's tough.

2386
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:00,000
I guess I'm just going to go with this.

2387
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,840
I'm going to try to go with like some Hannah Montana look, maybe.

2388
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,760
Hannah Montana was popular, right?

2389
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:06,640
In 2014.

2390
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,080
That was earlier.

2391
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,240
I think it was over by then, right?

2392
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:12,480
I'm sorry to tell you.

2393
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:13,040
Are we done?

2394
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,080
Oh, my God.

2395
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:15,520
Our age is short.

2396
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,080
We're Hag Maxing.

2397
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,600
Maybe we should set the theme to Hag Maxing.

2398
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,440
Because I don't think I know what's going on.

2399
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:23,920
Oh, my God.

2400
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,840
Are there like grandmas or something?

2401
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,280
Grandmas!

2402
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,000
We need that.

2403
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:28,560
Let's do it.

2404
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,120
Let's do it.

2405
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:29,760
Let's do it.

2406
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,040
Okay, okay, okay.

2407
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,280
Maybe this one.

2408
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:35,600
Actually, maybe this one is cute.

2409
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:39,840
I'm going to try going for Hannah Montana.

2410
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:44,800
I know it wasn't popular, but I feel like I'm going to try going for it.

2411
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,480
How are you going to feel if those kids say it?

2412
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:47,680
What is Hannah Montana?

2413
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,560
I'm going to cry!

2414
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:49,440
Oh, God.

2415
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,320
You can cry.

2416
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,480
That's what I'm going to do.

2417
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,200
What do you mean?

2418
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,320
What is Hannah Montana?

2419
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,440
I'm going to put everything in.

2420
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:56,560
You're going to put everything in your head.

2421
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:58,480
I don't know.

2422
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,280
2014.

2423
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:00,800
Maybe I'm just going to use...

2424
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,800
I was going to go with the first one.

2425
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:03,360
This one looks good.

2426
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:10,320
I'm going to go for like, I don't know, some kind of festival look.

2427
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,040
I don't know.

2428
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,160
Why just Google?

2429
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:13,680
Google hip to the best.

2430
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:14,480
Yeah, I am.

2431
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:15,600
Maybe I can go to Google.

2432
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:20,480
I was just wearing sweatpants and hoodies in 2014.

2433
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,480
That's what I always wear on the time.

2434
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,160
Oh, there's a microphone here.

2435
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:27,440
That's perfect.

2436
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:27,680
Yeah.

2437
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:32,880
Gross socks.

2438
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,440
Oh my God.

2439
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,240
I need some socks.

2440
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:35,840
And then...

2441
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,440
Oh, you can climb up the shelf.

2442
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:40,000
What the heck?

2443
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,240
You can climb up the shelves.

2444
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:42,560
Yeah.

2445
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,920
I did that accidentally too.

2446
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,680
Oh, you kind of can.

2447
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:48,000
Yeah.

2448
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,880
Oh, there's a headband over there.

2449
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:51,520
I could have used that.

2450
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,040
I don't want to use a thing.

2451
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:53,680
I'll use it right.

2452
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:54,800
Oh, you have to buy the headband.

2453
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,600
Never mind.

2454
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:58,480
You even have to buy the headband.

2455
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,560
You even have to buy a headband.

2456
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:02,000
Lame.

2457
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:05,680
$3,000.

2458
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:13,280
Layers.

2459
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:16,080
More layers.

2460
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:19,360
There's like cardigans and stuff.

2461
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:20,240
Where are the cardigans?

2462
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,280
Yeah, where are the cardigans?

2463
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:21,920
I need one too.

2464
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:31,360
Hair.

2465
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,160
What kind of hair?

2466
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:34,000
Dang it.

2467
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,320
You need this one?

2468
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:40,880
Oh, what the heck?

2469
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,080
What the heck?

2470
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,560
I shouldn't have chose Hannah Montana.

2471
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,080
I shouldn't have gone with her.

2472
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:46,720
I'm failing.

2473
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,000
There's someone.

2474
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:50,720
I'm just failing really badly.

2475
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:53,280
It doesn't look anything like Hannah Montana.

2476
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,800
I don't know what I'm like.

2477
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,000
Where are the hoods?

2478
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:58,320
Hoodies.

2479
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:59,360
There was like another hoodie.

2480
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:00,480
Hats.

2481
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:00,800
Hats.

2482
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,120
Oh, there.

2483
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:01,840
Okay, sorry.

2484
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:02,880
What are my hats?

2485
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:03,280
This.

2486
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:03,760
Give me that.

2487
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:05,280
Yeah.

2488
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:06,880
Oh, yeah.

2489
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,840
They look like I'm just going to school or like...

2490
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,840
Except for spectators.

2491
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:12,480
Oh, I don't know.

2492
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,840
Going to school.

2493
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,760
I mean, it's 2014.

2494
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,120
I mean, 2014.

2495
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:20,400
Oh my god, 2014.

2496
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,440
2014.

2497
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,160
You could go to school.

2498
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:24,560
It's cool.

2499
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:26,400
I think I'll die there in 2014, right?

2500
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,600
Maybe, maybe not like this.

2501
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:30,800
Oh, no.

2502
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:31,440
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

2503
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,560
There's accessories.

2504
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:32,720
X.

2505
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:34,720
And accessories.

2506
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:40,480
How do I change the color of the hair?

2507
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:41,520
What?

2508
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:43,440
Oh, there we go.

2509
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,480
And then I want it.

2510
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,000
All right, I'm good, I think.

2511
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:52,960
Oh my god.

2512
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:55,600
This hair is killing me.

2513
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,000
No, I hate it when they click me out.

2514
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Yeah, then I get up to chair.

2515
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:02,960
I'm still working here.

2516
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,000
Wow, to cook.

2517
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:06,640
Yeah.

2518
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:08,560
Perfection takes time.

2519
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,200
Come on.

2520
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:09,760
All right.

2521
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:12,080
I have no idea.

2522
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:12,400
Thanks.

2523
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:13,040
I don't understand.

2524
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:13,760
Thanks.

2525
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,240
Okay.

2526
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,000
Maybe we should have dressed Attack on Titan

2527
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,720
because Attack on Titan got popular in 2014, right?

2528
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,240
And like, popularized anime.

2529
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,000
That's true.

2530
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,840
Attack on Titan did get popular.

2531
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,240
I am no later what I'm doing.

2532
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:29,360
Say I'm glasses.

2533
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:30,720
Now this is a theme game.

2534
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,080
The sunglasses shoot.

2535
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:32,720
No, no.

2536
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:34,640
No.

2537
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:35,520
I haven't got a button.

2538
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,480
I don't have anything.

2539
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,120
Give me that.

2540
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:37,680
D.

2541
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:38,080
No.

2542
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,520
Oh, god.

2543
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,840
I was just a basic boy.

2544
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,120
Oh, my gosh.

2545
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:44,400
Why am I always first?

2546
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,360
I don't want to go first.

2547
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,440
Oh, thank you.

2548
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:48,880
I don't need it.

2549
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:49,760
That's very cute, though.

2550
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:50,160
I love this.

2551
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,280
You like my shoes?

2552
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:52,560
I like it.

2553
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:53,920
This shoes are adorable.

2554
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,040
Why I need to post on them.

2555
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:58,480
Oh, it was happening in 2014.

2556
01:34:58,480 --> 01:34:59,840
What happened in 2014?

2557
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,080
Chats are lost.

2558
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:03,200
What's in 2014?

2559
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:03,840
Oh, I need to write.

2560
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:04,560
Oh, I know.

2561
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,880
I need to write Hannah Montana.

2562
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:09,040
Okay, there.

2563
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:09,360
Pause.

2564
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:10,960
Me too.

2565
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:11,440
Wait, the girl.

2566
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:12,160
What?

2567
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,120
Chats are rude.

2568
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,040
I knew it.

2569
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:15,680
Girl, what?

2570
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:16,800
Wait, I need to ask them.

2571
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:21,440
Do you guys know Hannah Montana?

2572
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:25,120
I think they better know Hannah Montana.

2573
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:25,600
Okay.

2574
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:27,760
It's also cute.

2575
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:28,480
The little melon.

2576
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:29,120
The little melon.

2577
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:31,600
Adorable.

2578
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,200
The hell is Hannah Montana?

2579
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:35,360
Someone said yes.

2580
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,560
Someone said yes, though.

2581
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,120
Someone said the hell is Hannah Montana?

2582
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:41,760
Are you kidding me?

2583
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:44,400
I think they're not even sure.

2584
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:46,800
Yes, I think.

2585
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:47,920
Oh, no.

2586
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:49,200
Yes, I think.

2587
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:50,320
Oh, my God.

2588
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:51,680
Man, what the hell?

2589
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,840
Wait, let's ask what they know Miley Cyrus.

2590
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:56,800
Miley Cyrus.

2591
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,320
They know Miley Cyrus.

2592
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,760
They have to know Miley Cyrus.

2593
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,280
Exactly.

2594
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,080
Thank you, Helsinki.

2595
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,440
Wait, she's censored.

2596
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:04,880
Wait, why?

2597
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,000
Hannah Montana is Miley before the wrecking ball.

2598
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,280
Hannah Montana.

2599
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:09,760
No.

2600
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:12,880
Oh, my God.

2601
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:13,440
The girl.

2602
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,480
Oh, that's so cute.

2603
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,440
Hannah is Miley.

2604
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,080
Who is Miley?

2605
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:19,760
Oh, God.

2606
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:21,760
Endifference.

2607
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,880
What do you watch?

2608
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,240
This is not skivvidy.

2609
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:26,400
This is not what we do.

2610
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,760
I have to tell them.

2611
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:28,480
Oh, my God.

2612
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:31,520
Endifference didn't pass the live check.

2613
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,600
Oh, this is very pretty.

2614
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:38,160
That's not, not very sigma.

2615
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:43,040
Oh, my God.

2616
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,160
That's sigma.

2617
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:44,800
He knows it.

2618
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,600
Ellen Masco.

2619
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:46,080
Oh, my God.

2620
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,640
He knows it.

2621
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:47,360
Oh, my God.

2622
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,640
Oh, my God.

2623
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,440
Why?

2624
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,480
Why aren't you lying?

2625
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:52,400
Oh, God.

2626
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,480
I came in like a wrecking ball.

2627
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,680
Yes, he's her father.

2628
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,480
Oh, my God.

2629
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,600
Wrong dad.

2630
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:05,760
Wrong dad.

2631
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,880
I also know the funny numbers.

2632
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,120
Funny numbers?

2633
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:12,160
What's funny numbers?

2634
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,480
I also know the funny numbers, man.

2635
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:14,960
Who?

2636
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:15,520
69?

2637
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:17,280
420?

2638
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:18,640
420?

2639
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:19,520
24?

2640
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:20,960
I don't know any other funny numbers.

2641
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:22,800
Yeah.

2642
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,120
These people were still in the womb in 2014.

2643
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:25,600
Trill.

2644
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:26,800
Yep.

2645
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,720
He gave me a tiger truck and he smashed it.

2646
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:31,280
Oh, my God.

2647
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,240
I feel so old.

2648
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:33,680
I didn't expect to come out of this.

2649
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:34,320
I'm depressed.

2650
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:34,880
Oh, my God.

2651
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:35,760
Oh, my God.

2652
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:36,800
What the heck's going on?

2653
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:37,440
I don't know.

2654
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,040
I don't know what to say, Milano.

2655
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,400
They don't know head on Montana.

2656
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:41,280
I don't know.

2657
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,200
Miley's like, not even Miley's like.

2658
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,400
Oh, damn.

2659
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:45,440
Yeah.

2660
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,960
Set the next theme to like,

2661
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,000
heck, you know, Bach on.

2662
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:49,520
Like.

2663
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:49,920
Oh, yeah.

2664
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:50,960
Let's do grandma themes.

2665
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:52,240
I won.

2666
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:53,120
What?

2667
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,000
Let's go.

2668
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:54,960
Let's go.

2669
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:55,840
Let's come back.

2670
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:56,320
Let's go.

2671
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:58,560
Do I have enough?

2672
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,080
I don't think I have themes anymore.

2673
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:01,280
No.

2674
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:04,480
Pop, pop, power rangers.

2675
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:07,520
Not enough theme prop.

2676
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:08,000
Dying it.

2677
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,120
I want to do grandma.

2678
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,040
I don't have enough anymore.

2679
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:12,800
Oh, dang it.

2680
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,480
I feel myself turning to death.

2681
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,160
So old.

2682
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:19,280
We can get through this.

2683
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:20,640
Yep.

2684
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:21,920
In death, we're all the same.

2685
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:23,280
We will meet them again one day.

2686
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:24,240
And then.

2687
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:27,760
We all end up in the same spot at the end.

2688
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:28,320
Exactly.

2689
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:29,280
Oh, my God.

2690
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:35,520
That's not a child.

2691
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,960
You're telling me that's not a child.

2692
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,640
He's like, oh, I insulted so many children.

2693
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:40,720
That's he's telling me he's not a child.

2694
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,040
Why is not a child?

2695
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,120
Insulted one too many toddlers.

2696
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,600
But I'm a VC band.

2697
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:48,400
Wait, toddlers?

2698
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,760
Someone said, does anyone have VC?

2699
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:50,480
Wait, there's a VC?

2700
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:52,480
Wait, why VC?

2701
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:53,920
I want to join VC.

2702
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,440
I don't want to join VC.

2703
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:56,560
Absolutely not.

2704
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,240
I want to join VC.

2705
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:00,240
Just to get cursed open, little kids.

2706
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:01,520
How do you even use VC?

2707
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:02,160
How do we join?

2708
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:02,320
How do we join?

2709
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,080
I don't think there's even a VC here.

2710
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:04,560
Is there?

2711
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:07,120
I think I said you have to like connect your phone to like.

2712
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:08,000
Your phone.

2713
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,800
And parents let their children do that.

2714
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,000
Oh, it's no day.

2715
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,360
People let their children do that.

2716
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,960
I mean, I don't think people are paying attention

2717
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,640
to what their children are doing on Roblox.

2718
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:20,160
Yeah.

2719
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:21,440
So over.

2720
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:24,400
Oh, people are just going to all look the same.

2721
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,200
I know.

2722
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,440
That's why I say on the site to think if there's something.

2723
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:28,320
I got to do something.

2724
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,600
We got to do something different.

2725
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:31,040
I think this.

2726
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:31,680
Yeah.

2727
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:32,400
Definitely.

2728
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:36,720
Maybe I'll do like a light pink.

2729
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:38,720
Oh, white.

2730
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,880
How about a nice winter skirt?

2731
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,320
It is cute, actually.

2732
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:48,880
Hmm.

2733
01:39:51,600 --> 01:40:00,320
I think for game chat, you have to verify your ID.

2734
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:01,520
No.

2735
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:02,240
Yeah.

2736
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:04,000
No verification.

2737
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,560
Maybe there's some verification, but I feel like your ID.

2738
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:07,920
Oh, this is cute.

2739
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:14,720
Oh, make it like.

2740
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,280
Let's see.

2741
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:15,760
Let's go.

2742
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:19,280
Hmm.

2743
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:30,000
I think all my person is going to freeze,

2744
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,360
but I'm giving her some trousers.

2745
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:43,840
This is this is not a very wintry look.

2746
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:46,240
I missed up.

2747
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:49,520
I already saw like five people look exactly like me.

2748
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:50,000
Yeah.

2749
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:51,760
I look exactly like all the other girls.

2750
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:53,920
Oh, no.

2751
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:56,080
You are like other girls.

2752
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,760
I'm exactly like the other girls.

2753
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,320
Middle school me would be so embarrassed.

2754
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:06,960
I'm going to go.

2755
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,960
Oh, maybe I can do a pattern.

2756
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,120
Oh, I keep forgetting there's patterns.

2757
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,840
Something something something snowy.

2758
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:15,920
Or maybe this one.

2759
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:18,240
Oh, that looks awful.

2760
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:18,640
Oh, wait.

2761
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,400
Wait, the patterns are so cute.

2762
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:20,800
What?

2763
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,160
Yeah, the patterns are adorable.

2764
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:26,880
Let's see here.

2765
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:30,240
No.

2766
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,200
I'm here to look as basic as the rest of them.

2767
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:38,480
Too many options now.

2768
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:40,160
I don't read.

2769
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:43,600
No.

2770
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:46,000
No.

2771
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:49,920
I'm going to take this backpack off.

2772
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:50,800
It's ugly.

2773
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:54,960
Who would wear this in winter?

2774
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,120
Um, the hot girls.

2775
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,800
Hot girls don't get cold.

2776
01:41:58,800 --> 01:41:59,120
Okay.

2777
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:00,000
They don't get cold.

2778
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,840
So of course they would wear this in winter.

2779
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:05,280
Of course they would.

2780
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:06,080
What else would they wear?

2781
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,680
Like the fashionable clothes?

2782
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:08,320
No, no.

2783
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:09,280
Yeah, I know.

2784
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:12,160
Yeah, no matter the weather.

2785
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:12,400
Yeah.

2786
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,520
The girls would get it.

2787
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:17,920
Get it.

2788
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:24,320
I'm going to try putting on nails for the first time.

2789
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,440
Oh, hair, hair, hair, hair.

2790
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:28,160
Wait, that's not hair.

2791
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:31,920
And then I don't know how to make them longer though.

2792
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:33,040
Oh, well.

2793
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,720
Wait, I'm actually kind of slain.

2794
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:45,520
What the heck?

2795
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:48,640
Hmm.

2796
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,640
I'm going to so freeze if I wore this in winter.

2797
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:55,200
That's okay.

2798
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:58,400
It's worth it.

2799
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,800
I can't even see why they're all there.

2800
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:04,640
What color did I choose?

2801
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:04,880
Shit.

2802
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:05,680
This is good.

2803
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:09,520
Why is my hair pinkish?

2804
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:10,400
What is going on?

2805
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:11,520
Huh?

2806
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:14,000
No, they kicked me out of the chair.

2807
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:14,400
Whatever.

2808
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:19,440
Okay, I need gloves.

2809
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:21,920
I need shoes.

2810
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:22,880
Shit.

2811
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,520
Wear the gloves.

2812
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:24,000
Wear the gloves.

2813
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:24,320
Oh, no.

2814
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:24,640
Oh, yeah.

2815
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:25,680
Gloves is a good idea.

2816
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:26,880
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

2817
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:28,400
Where are they?

2818
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:29,280
Boots, boots, boots.

2819
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:30,640
That's not gloves.

2820
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:32,240
That's not gloves either.

2821
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:36,560
Uh, here we go.

2822
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:38,400
Wear the gloves.

2823
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:40,160
I can't find them either.

2824
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:42,640
Oh, they're down here at the end.

2825
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:44,640
Oh, they have.

2826
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,840
Oh, damn it.

2827
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,160
Oh, they have socks.

2828
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:49,280
Oh, right now.

2829
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:50,400
These gloves.

2830
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:50,880
There we go.

2831
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:51,760
Oh, a scarf.

2832
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,520
A scarf makes so much sense.

2833
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:54,000
Where are you going?

2834
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:54,240
Yeah.

2835
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:57,680
All right.

2836
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:00,320
I'm ready.

2837
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:00,800
Oh, there.

2838
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:02,880
Oh, that's cute.

2839
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,640
Where's the high socks?

2840
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:07,680
That would look good, I think.

2841
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,960
My legs are going to freeze.

2842
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:12,560
All right, I'm good.

2843
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:15,680
Oh, Teddy's like.

2844
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:16,800
Yeah.

2845
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,240
My legs are going to freeze, too.

2846
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:20,400
It's okay.

2847
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:20,640
It's worth it.

2848
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:21,920
Everything else is warm.

2849
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:22,480
Yeah.

2850
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:22,800
Yeah.

2851
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:26,880
Let's see if I can quickly change my makeup

2852
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:27,760
to something prettier.

2853
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:28,480
Five seconds.

2854
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:30,800
Oh, god.

2855
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,080
There's no time.

2856
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:32,480
Damn it.

2857
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:34,640
Confirm.

2858
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:35,440
Oh, my gosh.

2859
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:38,320
Wow.

2860
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:42,080
That is so pretty.

2861
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:43,280
Thank you.

2862
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,640
Oh, my god.

2863
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:46,800
How did you do that?

2864
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,000
I've surprised myself.

2865
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,920
Dry the layers.

2866
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,640
The layer is so cute.

2867
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:56,400
We slay, slay.

2868
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,040
Oh, my gosh.

2869
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:02,560
Oh, the tummy is freezing.

2870
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:04,800
The tummy is freezing.

2871
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:07,760
Oh, my god.

2872
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:10,880
I love the boots.

2873
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:11,840
Actually, I want those.

2874
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,040
Like in all black, too.

2875
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:19,680
Oh, there's no queen.

2876
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:20,800
It's Elsa.

2877
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:21,600
It does look like Elsa.

2878
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:22,800
Yeah, Elsa was the female.

2879
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:23,600
It's going for her.

2880
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:27,760
Oh, my gosh.

2881
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:28,800
Going for Elsa.

2882
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,720
And then I gave up on the rest of Elsa

2883
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:31,440
after I did the hair.

2884
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:31,920
Well, immediately.

2885
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:32,160
Right.

2886
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,120
You guys look perfect.

2887
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:35,680
Oh, my god.

2888
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:36,640
It's a Jimmy Bees.

2889
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:37,120
It's a Jimmy Bees.

2890
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:37,600
It's a Jimmy Bees.

2891
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:38,000
It's a Jimmy Bees.

2892
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:38,480
It's a Jimmy Bees.

2893
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:39,040
It's a Jimmy Bees.

2894
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:39,760
It's a Jimmy Bees.

2895
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:41,680
And you.

2896
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:42,800
Thank you.

2897
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,880
You got the highest praise just now.

2898
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:47,360
The bunny.

2899
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,080
And there's no bunny.

2900
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,800
No bunny.

2901
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:51,760
No bunny.

2902
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:52,960
So cute.

2903
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:55,600
Hypothermia is a small price to pay.

2904
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:56,480
To pay.

2905
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,600
Exactly.

2906
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:58,800
Why is it different so mean?

2907
01:45:58,800 --> 01:45:59,840
They keep getting censored.

2908
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:01,840
Snowball fight.

2909
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,280
Oh, that's cute.

2910
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:04,160
A white apple.

2911
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,120
Is that a white apple?

2912
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:05,520
Oh, oh.

2913
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:06,720
Oh, my.

2914
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:09,840
They would freeze to death, though.

2915
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:11,920
We all would.

2916
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:13,680
Unlike the rest of us that are definitely

2917
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:14,960
also going to freeze to death.

2918
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:17,520
Oh, my god.

2919
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:22,800
Or the bag.

2920
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:23,920
Wow, bad ass.

2921
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,680
I'm rating this lower just because

2922
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:29,280
they weren't original with the fluffy stuff.

2923
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:30,560
Oh, yeah.

2924
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:34,800
And I'm not even posing.

2925
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:36,960
Oh, god.

2926
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:37,760
I died.

2927
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:38,480
I died.

2928
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:39,280
Exactly.

2929
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:39,600
Yeah.

2930
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:42,320
Oh, same thing.

2931
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:43,360
This is pretty basic.

2932
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,560
Same as the other one.

2933
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:44,880
Yeah.

2934
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:45,440
Basic.

2935
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:46,640
Yeah.

2936
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:48,640
Let me be what?

2937
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,120
Oh, oh, yeah.

2938
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:51,680
Fan.

2939
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:52,000
I think.

2940
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,280
Oh, my god.

2941
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:02,560
Oh, this one's cute, too.

2942
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:04,240
But I gotta rate it low.

2943
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:05,280
You're using this.

2944
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,240
Yeah, I'm using this.

2945
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:07,840
It's all the white and the fluff.

2946
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:09,680
Oh, gosh.

2947
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:11,760
We got someone self-priming in there.

2948
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:12,640
Wait, what?

2949
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:14,960
Self-priming in the Roblox chat.

2950
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:15,440
Wait, can there is?

2951
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:18,000
Can we do this, too, wait?

2952
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:21,680
I actually know there's kids here.

2953
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:22,080
I can't.

2954
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:25,280
I don't want the Roblox kids.

2955
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:25,760
Yeah.

2956
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:26,080
Fine.

2957
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:26,640
Fine.

2958
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:27,200
It's fine.

2959
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:27,840
I'm fine.

2960
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,040
I'm sorry.

2961
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,000
It looks bad.

2962
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:32,240
I have 4K subs.

2963
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:33,440
Yo, who this punk?

2964
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:37,280
Damn, I didn't have a 4K subs.

2965
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:39,120
I'm not saying anything.

2966
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:39,680
Oh, my god.

2967
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:40,160
Interesting.

2968
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,200
I'm not saying anything.

2969
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:43,360
I'm not saying anything.

2970
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:44,160
Oh, god.

2971
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:45,680
Let's go.

2972
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:48,960
Oh, it's finished.

2973
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:49,440
Self-priming.

2974
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,240
Let's go.

2975
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:51,520
Not rigged at all.

2976
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:53,760
Like, in the slightest.

2977
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,280
No, I'm not rigged at all.

2978
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:56,160
I'm not rigged at all.

2979
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:57,840
No, we wouldn't rig the.

2980
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:00,240
Oh, my god.

2981
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:01,920
That's the most subs in the lobby.

2982
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:03,760
Yeah.

2983
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:04,880
I'm not going to say a thing.

2984
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:05,840
I'm not going to say a thing.

2985
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:09,200
Don't tell.

2986
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:10,160
Don't say anything.

2987
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:11,760
Wait a minute.

2988
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:12,560
Don't say anything.

2989
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:13,280
Don't say anything.

2990
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,960
Oh, don't say anything.

2991
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,440
I don't want people from Roblox to come to street.

2992
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:18,320
What are you here for?

2993
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,560
Are they talking about the young insminors or something?

2994
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:21,440
Well, subs, though.

2995
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:25,040
Like, like 4K subs on Twitch or YouTube or TikTok.

2996
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:25,520
I guess TikTok.

2997
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:26,080
Ask them.

2998
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:27,280
Say YouTube or Twitch.

2999
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:28,720
Probably TikTok.

3000
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:29,360
No, but like, go wait.

3001
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:30,640
4K and Twitch would be impressive.

3002
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:31,360
Very impressive.

3003
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:34,240
Oh, god.

3004
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:36,080
There's 14 year olds.

3005
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:36,720
Oh, geez.

3006
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:40,320
Wait, are they even allowed to have YouTube?

3007
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,120
Yeah, I think it's 13 plus, right?

3008
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:45,440
Yeah, it is 13 plus, probably.

3009
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:46,720
I see you.

3010
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:48,720
I was like 12, but let's.

3011
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:50,800
We all were.

3012
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:51,760
We all were.

3013
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:54,400
My favorite singer.

3014
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:55,440
Okay.

3015
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:57,120
Oh, got it.

3016
01:48:57,680 --> 01:48:58,720
This is how you begin.

3017
01:48:58,720 --> 01:48:59,040
Freak.

3018
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:00,400
Oh, no.

3019
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:00,880
Okay.

3020
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:01,440
Mine is dead.

3021
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,560
Your favorite singer is dead?

3022
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:05,120
Oh, god.

3023
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:05,840
Yeah, too.

3024
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,720
Michael Jackson and the lead singer from Lincoln Park.

3025
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:10,960
Oh, okay.

3026
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:11,760
Let's see.

3027
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:12,800
I don't know.

3028
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:13,040
All right.

3029
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:14,240
I'm going to do that.

3030
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:14,960
I know what to do.

3031
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:16,560
Yeah, I know what to do.

3032
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,600
None of my favorites do the same thing.

3033
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:21,040
Don't have any style.

3034
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:23,120
Yeah, my favorite singers don't have any style either.

3035
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:24,720
Like, um.

3036
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:27,040
Where's the simple style, but.

3037
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:29,040
Um.

3038
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,560
Oh, shit.

3039
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:34,240
I'm just going to dress up as Justin Bieber.

3040
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:35,600
I'm going to be absolutely cool.

3041
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:36,880
I'm hot.

3042
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:37,520
I'm going to do hot.

3043
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:40,000
I think it was so good.

3044
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:40,480
That's a good idea.

3045
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,440
That's a good idea.

3046
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:42,080
Good.

3047
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:42,400
Shit.

3048
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,440
That's such a good idea.

3049
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,440
Oh, okay.

3050
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:46,240
Is that a twin tail?

3051
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:46,560
Great.

3052
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:46,880
No.

3053
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:50,080
I'm going to oopsies.

3054
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:51,760
There's no real twin tail.

3055
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:52,080
Oh, no.

3056
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,280
I'm going to become a believer.

3057
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:57,760
Okay.

3058
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:00,240
I'm going to go for.

3059
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,240
Time to become a Hatsune Miku.

3060
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:05,280
Hatsune Miku.

3061
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:05,600
Oh, no.

3062
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:06,320
I can't change that.

3063
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:07,280
I'm going to speak British people.

3064
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:08,800
What?

3065
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:10,240
What?

3066
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:10,800
Who said that?

3067
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:16,320
Oh, no.

3068
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,680
I'm already failing in the hair stage.

3069
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:19,600
Oh, gosh.

3070
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:19,840
Um.

3071
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:21,760
Oh, no.

3072
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:22,320
Nice.

3073
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:22,720
Great.

3074
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:27,520
Hmm.

3075
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,000
All right.

3076
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,440
Let's see what Bieber dressed up as in like 20.

3077
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:32,320
I don't know.

3078
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:33,280
When was he popular?

3079
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:34,720
20, 10, 20, 10.

3080
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:35,840
20, 13.

3081
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:36,560
20, 13.

3082
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:37,200
Okay.

3083
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:38,560
Wasn't he born in 2010 or something?

3084
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:38,960
Oh, no.

3085
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:40,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3086
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:43,280
I don't know.

3087
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:46,480
Probably had baggy pants.

3088
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:49,600
Oh, this looks good.

3089
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:51,680
I'm going to be patterned.

3090
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:52,000
This.

3091
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:53,440
Oh.

3092
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,560
Big lips.

3093
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,080
Mine is so simple, I think.

3094
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:00,880
She dresses so simple.

3095
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:08,240
Glyps, I think.

3096
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:15,440
Oh, it's going to be dark.

3097
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:20,240
Make them believe.

3098
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:22,240
Make them believe.

3099
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:22,480
Believe.

3100
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:32,480
The hair kind of darker.

3101
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:37,360
Can I, can I not wear a singular man, man shirt?

3102
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:38,080
Can't be put on.

3103
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:38,800
Can't be put on.

3104
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:41,360
And on this wild.

3105
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:43,120
All right.

3106
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,200
Clipping off.

3107
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:53,600
This song will be stuck in your head.

3108
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,320
It's getting there.

3109
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:58,240
You're going to start dreaming about it.

3110
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:03,120
Justin Bieber wore a lot of purple, I think.

3111
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,640
I think mine is not recognizable,

3112
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:08,480
but this is the only thing she wears.

3113
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:10,480
Maybe something longer.

3114
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,960
Actually, what is?

3115
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:18,800
Enter VC and start singing for them.

3116
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:25,200
Let's see.

3117
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:35,200
I don't know if this will work.

3118
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:36,960
Is your hat today, Mika?

3119
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:38,400
It looks so good.

3120
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:39,680
Oh, my God.

3121
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,160
There's two.

3122
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:40,640
So good.

3123
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:41,280
There's two.

3124
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:42,000
There's two.

3125
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:42,560
Oh, no.

3126
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:43,120
It's a two.

3127
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:43,600
Oh, no.

3128
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:46,640
Oh, no.

3129
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:48,400
I need shoes.

3130
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:49,200
She lied.

3131
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:53,200
Do, do, do, do, do, do.

3132
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:01,680
I'm missing.

3133
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:04,640
I'm just Yassified Bieber.

3134
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,920
Yeah, the only thing she wears.

3135
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:17,600
Always in black outfit.

3136
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:24,560
I need to find that I can think that I'm looking for.

3137
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:38,000
All right, I think I'm done my Bieber.

3138
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,720
Yeah, I think I think I'm done too.

3139
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:42,080
But I'm so simple.

3140
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:43,520
I don't know.

3141
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:44,720
Does Bieber play basketball?

3142
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:46,320
Oh, I see a Michael Jackson.

3143
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:48,000
Damn.

3144
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:48,560
Oh.

3145
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:49,840
He had the Michael Jackson.

3146
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:55,040
Unless there's like, there's no button up.

3147
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:56,480
There's no mic anywhere.

3148
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:03,360
Oh, where do you get the mic?

3149
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:05,600
Oh, it's down the end.

3150
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:06,800
Yeah.

3151
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:09,680
Where the, where the backs are and stuff and the wings.

3152
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:10,720
Yeah, where the wings are.

3153
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:12,560
Oh, yeah, there it is.

3154
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:14,160
Maybe I'll wear this instead.

3155
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:15,040
There.

3156
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:20,400
Yeah, that looks more like Bieber.

3157
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:23,520
Five seconds.

3158
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:24,880
Oh, oh, God.

3159
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:25,680
Yeah.

3160
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:26,080
Two.

3161
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:26,720
Oh, God.

3162
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:27,360
One.

3163
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:27,920
One.

3164
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:29,520
Oh, oh, God.

3165
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:31,200
I want simple.

3166
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:32,800
Okay.

3167
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:33,520
Let me go.

3168
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:39,280
I like the, I like the hair strip of pink.

3169
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:40,560
Yeah.

3170
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:41,040
Yeah.

3171
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:41,600
That's cute.

3172
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:44,880
I swear, if they don't know who Hatsune Miku is.

3173
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:46,160
Oh, wait.

3174
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:47,120
That's, that's, that's the thing.

3175
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:47,600
You never mind.

3176
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:48,480
That's my thoughts again.

3177
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:49,120
Recognize this.

3178
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:52,640
Oh, let's go indifference.

3179
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:53,760
The redemption arc.

3180
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:00,000
I can't say Justin Bieber in chat.

3181
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:02,400
I can't just, I can't.

3182
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:03,280
What about Bieber?

3183
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:04,240
Wait, just right.

3184
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:05,360
Babe, babe, babe.

3185
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:07,280
I can't say Justin Bieber in chat.

3186
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:11,520
Yeah, I'm just never ate it.

3187
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:13,200
What the heck?

3188
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:14,400
Oh, my God.

3189
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:15,760
So cute.

3190
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:16,560
There she is.

3191
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:20,960
Oh, my God.

3192
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:23,520
It's so cute.

3193
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,800
Miku.

3194
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,680
Another Miku.

3195
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:26,320
Pose, Miku, pose.

3196
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:27,040
Another one.

3197
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:27,920
Oh, no.

3198
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,120
Another one.

3199
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:30,000
Another one.

3200
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:33,760
I did, I know.

3201
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,320
That's so good.

3202
01:55:37,120 --> 01:55:37,680
I love it.

3203
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:39,280
If it's her.

3204
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:42,400
Oh, it works so well.

3205
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:45,600
She always wear like fancy black long dresses.

3206
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:51,840
Oh, my God.

3207
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:54,000
Wow.

3208
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:57,840
Wait, that's female.

3209
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:58,480
That's female.

3210
01:55:58,480 --> 01:55:59,600
My little Jackson.

3211
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:00,080
It is.

3212
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:08,400
Where's the moonwalk?

3213
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:09,360
We need the moonwalk.

3214
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:13,360
Oh, my God.

3215
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:14,880
Who is this?

3216
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:15,840
Who is this?

3217
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:18,640
Some K-pop guys.

3218
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:20,560
Looks like K-pop guys.

3219
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:22,080
It could be any K-pop guy.

3220
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:24,080
True, true, true.

3221
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:24,960
Generic singer.

3222
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:25,840
It's here.

3223
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:36,240
This looks like it could be.

3224
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:37,360
Nicki Minaj.

3225
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:37,760
Right?

3226
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:38,240
Nicki.

3227
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:38,640
Right?

3228
01:56:38,640 --> 01:56:39,440
Yeah.

3229
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:39,840
Yeah.

3230
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:40,240
Maybe.

3231
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:41,360
Maybe.

3232
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:42,160
Not sure.

3233
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:43,440
Let's see if I can spell her name.

3234
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:44,400
Don't recognize.

3235
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:45,040
Very green.

3236
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:48,320
Anyways, I'm very popular singer censored.

3237
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:49,760
Yeah.

3238
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:51,040
I think you have to separate it.

3239
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:53,280
Like first name and last name, which is weird.

3240
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:56,240
Yo, who is this?

3241
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:57,440
Who is this?

3242
01:56:58,320 --> 01:56:58,960
What?

3243
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:02,080
Why does Roblox censor half the chat?

3244
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:04,720
I'm going to say the whole chat's just like censored.

3245
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:05,440
I can't read this.

3246
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:06,240
Traverse.

3247
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:09,440
Why is a celebrity censored?

3248
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,280
Like are they, are kids not allowed to?

3249
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:13,840
Like a celebrity?

3250
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:15,360
Because they say.

3251
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:16,480
Oh my god.

3252
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:17,280
No, that's true.

3253
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:22,240
May I have your attention, please?

3254
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:23,280
Oh, it's Eminem.

3255
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:25,920
That's a good one.

3256
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:26,720
I like that one.

3257
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:27,760
Can you stand up?

3258
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:28,640
Can you stand up?

3259
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:33,280
It's back to Fortnite.

3260
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:36,080
I'm back to Fortnite.

3261
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:37,040
Come on.

3262
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:38,160
Jesus.

3263
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:38,800
The Tiki.

3264
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:39,120
Jesus.

3265
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:39,760
Jesus.

3266
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:40,240
Jesus.

3267
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:41,040
Let's go.

3268
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:41,520
Let's go.

3269
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,320
Let's go, Miku.

3270
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:42,800
Miku's.

3271
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:44,000
I'm going to sub our microphone.

3272
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:44,480
Please.

3273
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:48,480
Oh my god.

3274
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:51,440
Everyone knows Miku.

3275
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:52,800
She transcends generations.

3276
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:55,440
Are you doing, should we do one last chat?

3277
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:56,000
Yeah.

3278
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:56,560
We can do one last.

3279
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,000
Yeah, we actually did two hours.

3280
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:58,960
I'm so, so funny.

3281
01:57:58,960 --> 01:57:59,360
Oh, wow.

3282
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:01,040
That went by fast.

3283
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:03,040
Time passed by.

3284
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:03,520
It does.

3285
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:06,080
Yeah, I'm back to being Niki.

3286
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:08,000
Same.

3287
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:08,400
Niki.

3288
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:09,600
I'm going to be forever.

3289
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:10,560
Miku forever.

3290
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,160
Kids don't have typing rights.

3291
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:14,640
Kids don't have typing rights.

3292
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:15,360
Oh god.

3293
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:17,040
Oh my god.

3294
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:18,880
Their mom took their PC away.

3295
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:21,840
They're not playing on their PC.

3296
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:24,160
They're probably playing on their iPad or something, right?

3297
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:28,160
Why are they saying only one more and why are they crying?

3298
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:29,360
Wait, are they watching your stream?

3299
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:31,360
Oh, yeah.

3300
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:32,800
That's the post person, right?

3301
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:33,600
What have you done?

3302
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:34,720
Hello.

3303
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:36,320
Guys.

3304
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:36,640
Hello.

3305
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:38,720
I'm not streaming right now though.

3306
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:40,640
Oh, they're listening.

3307
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:45,040
Dude, they're watching the stream.

3308
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:47,520
They're stream sniping, guys.

3309
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:48,720
Oh, no, it's kidding.

3310
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:50,080
What's the theme?

3311
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:51,440
Live child.

3312
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:52,640
Everyone here is a fan.

3313
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:53,760
They're all our fans, guys.

3314
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:54,480
Fat of you.

3315
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:57,920
Everyone, all of us, all of us.

3316
01:58:57,920 --> 01:58:59,360
All the children, leave.

3317
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:01,120
Don't watch the stream.

3318
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:03,360
Wait, what is Casio big?

3319
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:05,520
What the heck is Casio big?

3320
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:08,400
So we all look the same then?

3321
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:08,880
Oh, wow.

3322
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:10,560
We all have to do one person.

3323
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:11,120
Wait, look it up.

3324
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:11,760
Look it up.

3325
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:12,240
Casio.

3326
01:59:12,240 --> 01:59:13,440
No, it's like with person.

3327
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:15,120
Yeah, and he's just wearing a hoodie.

3328
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:17,760
I've seen this guy.

3329
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:18,880
He's like a streamer.

3330
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:20,800
He's the one.

3331
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:22,000
He has like funny clips.

3332
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,200
I've seen his clips before.

3333
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:24,960
So what does he wear?

3334
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:27,760
He just wears a big, gray hoodie.

3335
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:32,720
Like he wears big hoodies and like he dresses like a man.

3336
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:36,720
Normal guy.

3337
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:38,720
He just dresses like a dude.

3338
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:41,200
There's not much to go off of.

3339
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:43,040
There's not even a male on there, is there?

3340
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:46,880
Oh, I'm going to make him pretty with some layers.

3341
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:47,200
All right.

3342
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:49,280
Yeah, I'm going to do it later.

3343
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:50,800
I'm not going to change my character

3344
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,560
from being a hecking woman, though.

3345
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:53,840
I can't be bothered.

3346
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:54,960
I'm a man.

3347
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:56,880
We're all just going to look the same.

3348
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:58,000
Yeah, let's look the same.

3349
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:58,800
Are you a kitten?

3350
01:59:58,800 --> 01:59:59,360
What's up?

3351
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:02,000
Oh, my God.

3352
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,680
Why is the teddy bear so expensive?

3353
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:07,120
I know, right?

3354
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:07,760
It's so cute.

3355
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:08,960
It looks so expensive.

3356
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:10,320
Let's see.

3357
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:12,560
I'm going to put a dress, like a skirt on him.

3358
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:16,320
We're all, we're literally all just going to look

3359
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:17,920
like the same kind of girl.

3360
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:19,200
He's just a big guy.

3361
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,880
I can't wear the skirts.

3362
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:21,200
No.

3363
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:24,560
This is discrimination.

3364
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:26,320
And you do guy hairs.

3365
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,000
He's like a ginger too, right?

3366
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:29,200
Yeah.

3367
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:31,760
We do like a guy hairstyle.

3368
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:33,760
We can't do guy hairstyles, though.

3369
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:35,440
We can give ourselves shortish hair.

3370
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:36,960
Yes.

3371
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:38,960
Can you have beards in this game?

3372
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:39,520
You can.

3373
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:40,720
I gave myself a mustache.

3374
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:42,560
Okay.

3375
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:42,880
Okay.

3376
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:45,040
Let's see.

3377
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:45,840
Oh, oh, no, no, no.

3378
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:48,240
I kind of just look like PewDiePie.

3379
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:50,960
There's only like six male hair styles.

3380
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:51,760
What?

3381
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:52,000
Yeah.

3382
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:54,960
Damn.

3383
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:55,680
Oh, this is all right.

3384
02:00:55,680 --> 02:00:57,040
Guy's got it rough in this game.

3385
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:58,080
Yeah.

3386
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:00,400
Every customization game.

3387
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:01,280
It's not always Lamer.

3388
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:04,000
None of these faces look like him.

3389
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:09,120
None of these faces look like him, too.

3390
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:10,800
This is ginger.

3391
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:11,280
This is not.

3392
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:11,840
Oh, God, oh, God.

3393
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:14,080
This is, yeah, this is too fun.

3394
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:15,200
They need to be more ginger.

3395
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:17,920
More ginger.

3396
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:18,720
More ginger.

3397
02:01:20,720 --> 02:01:21,840
Yeah, like that.

3398
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:22,720
Do you do this one?

3399
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:27,200
Oh, good take.

3400
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:29,840
Here we go.

3401
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:31,280
Oh, oh my.

3402
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:37,360
Um, there's, there's really not.

3403
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,800
There's not much to pick from.

3404
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:41,600
No.

3405
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:44,000
Maybe I'll go a little bit different.

3406
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:47,360
I see pictures of him with a blue sweater.

3407
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:49,920
So I'm going to not be like the other girls,

3408
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:51,840
and I'm going to go with the blue sweater instead.

3409
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:54,000
Wait, I did the blue hoodie, too.

3410
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:54,800
I did the blue.

3411
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:55,440
You did the blue.

3412
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:56,000
What?

3413
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:56,240
Damn.

3414
02:01:56,240 --> 02:01:57,680
We're all so basic.

3415
02:01:57,680 --> 02:02:00,640
What if, or what if we just go like, let's see.

3416
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:06,080
I'm going to go like this.

3417
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:13,120
He's just a dude.

3418
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:15,760
He's just a guy.

3419
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:20,160
He's just, he's just a dude that dresses like a guy.

3420
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:22,240
I can't put on the teddy necklace.

3421
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:22,560
What?

3422
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:24,560
No, that's for a wait.

3423
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:24,960
I'm going to do the shirt man.

3424
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:25,360
This one.

3425
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:28,320
He has a photo of him shirtless.

3426
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:29,520
I'm just going to go with this.

3427
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:32,160
Okay, let's put on like.

3428
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:34,000
I'm gorgeous.

3429
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,040
Oh my god.

3430
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:37,040
Oh god.

3431
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:39,440
And he was doing a beanie.

3432
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:40,640
Where do I see a beanie?

3433
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:44,000
That's like normal beanie.

3434
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:46,000
I can't wear gloves.

3435
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:46,240
What?

3436
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:47,760
I go like this.

3437
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:49,520
I saw a beanie earlier.

3438
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:50,160
It's um.

3439
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:53,280
Where the fluffy clothes are.

3440
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:56,880
It has cat ears, but it's okay.

3441
02:02:57,520 --> 02:02:58,720
This is cat ears.

3442
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:00,560
It's a cat ear beanie.

3443
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:01,600
Where's the plain one?

3444
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:03,360
There's a plain one on the left.

3445
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:05,760
Right above the cat ear one.

3446
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:06,800
Right above the cat ear one.

3447
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:10,080
Oh, it's like a, not a beanie.

3448
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:13,280
Kind of like a, I should call it.

3449
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:16,800
Oh, okay.

3450
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:18,160
This beanie does look bad though.

3451
02:03:18,160 --> 02:03:20,800
I'm going to put a, I'm going to put a hat on instead maybe.

3452
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:22,000
Yeah.

3453
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,160
Does he wear a hat like that?

3454
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:26,240
Not really.

3455
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:32,480
He's either wearing nothing or like blue or red hoodie in the pictures I'm seeing.

3456
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:33,840
Yeah.

3457
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:34,960
I'm doing topless.

3458
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,520
You guys are using the skin tone.

3459
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:41,920
All right.

3460
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:43,520
Oh, that's, that's my final attempt.

3461
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:44,640
Wait, how do you make beard?

3462
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:47,840
You have to choose the face with the beard.

3463
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:49,360
The face of the beard.

3464
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:49,760
Oh no.

3465
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:51,600
No, I like my face.

3466
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:53,040
Whatever here.

3467
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:53,360
Oh yeah.

3468
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:54,240
Forgot he has a.

3469
02:03:56,640 --> 02:03:59,680
Oh no.

3470
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:00,640
I did something wrong.

3471
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:01,760
Oh my God.

3472
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:03,520
The cat is so cute.

3473
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:04,560
Does he have a cat?

3474
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:07,040
I don't know.

3475
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:08,080
Someone.

3476
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:09,760
But.

3477
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:10,240
Laffy.

3478
02:04:10,240 --> 02:04:11,040
What do you know?

3479
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:13,440
What?

3480
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:13,840
What?

3481
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:14,480
What do you know?

3482
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:15,040
Oh, what's wrong?

3483
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:16,960
Great red makeup.

3484
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:19,680
I wanted to try something new.

3485
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:23,360
Reinventing style.

3486
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:24,400
That's our mission, right?

3487
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:26,960
Yeah, girl.

3488
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:30,560
Looks so lost.

3489
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:32,800
Oh my God.

3490
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:33,360
Hello.

3491
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:35,360
I'm going to go out and make a move.

3492
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:37,760
Yeah.

3493
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:38,560
I spiced.

3494
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:42,320
Thank you.

3495
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:42,640
Thank you.

3496
02:04:43,120 --> 02:04:44,160
Oh my God.

3497
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:49,040
Everyone's going to look the same.

3498
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:52,480
Here, I'll do some poses.

3499
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:54,320
Wow.

3500
02:04:56,240 --> 02:04:57,280
The lips.

3501
02:04:57,280 --> 02:04:59,040
What do you use for our escape or lip care?

3502
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:02,960
There I go.

3503
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:03,680
Weirdo.

3504
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:07,600
Oh, I gave up.

3505
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:11,920
You don't have to say ooh about this.

3506
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:16,400
Cute.

3507
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:16,880
It's cute.

3508
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:18,960
I couldn't be bothered to change it to guy.

3509
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:20,240
It's so much effort.

3510
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:24,240
Well, it's just like putting on a shirt or something.

3511
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:25,840
You just go to the guy and click on him.

3512
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:26,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3513
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:28,960
Oh, shirtless.

3514
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:33,120
I'm liking it.

3515
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:34,080
I'm liking it.

3516
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:34,880
Oh, the pose.

3517
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:35,760
The pose.

3518
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:36,320
The pose.

3519
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,480
Slime star.

3520
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:38,880
Let's go.

3521
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:42,160
I like the hairstyle.

3522
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:45,440
Oh my God.

3523
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:46,720
Layers off.

3524
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:48,640
I found a picture of a lady's shirt.

3525
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:50,640
Ooh, fashionable.

3526
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:54,320
Oh, I like the pants.

3527
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:59,040
Call me fat and I'll shoot.

3528
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:00,720
I put the stockings on last second.

3529
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:04,080
Wait, I do remember a clip of him

3530
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:05,920
where he was like, nice person to call me fat

3531
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:07,520
gets banned or something like that.

3532
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:08,400
Wait, actually?

3533
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:08,640
Yeah.

3534
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:09,920
I don't know.

3535
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:11,440
Wait, this isn't getting censored.

3536
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:12,320
What the heck?

3537
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:14,000
Yeah, wait, how is that not getting censored?

3538
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,120
But everything else was.

3539
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:16,160
Yeah, it's true.

3540
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:17,280
The jurors get censored.

3541
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:18,640
It just doesn't make sense.

3542
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:20,400
Justin Bieber gets censored.

3543
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,840
Censorship in this game doesn't make sense.

3544
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:28,160
They got their priorities.

3545
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:29,680
Oh my God.

3546
02:06:29,680 --> 02:06:30,560
He's got no face.

3547
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:32,000
OK.

3548
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:32,480
No face.

3549
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:33,840
No face.

3550
02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:35,040
No face.

3551
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:36,160
Metaphor, four.

3552
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:37,680
What?

3553
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:38,720
What was that?

3554
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:39,520
What was that?

3555
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:41,200
I did not like that.

3556
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:42,640
I'm removing a star just for that.

3557
02:06:42,640 --> 02:06:43,280
What was that?

3558
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,200
Yeah, who was that?

3559
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:46,080
How do you do that?

3560
02:06:46,640 --> 02:06:47,600
I jump scare.

3561
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:48,720
How do you do that?

3562
02:06:48,720 --> 02:06:49,440
Is that a glitch?

3563
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:50,800
Oh, wow.

3564
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:53,200
Oh, wait, he has a cat?

3565
02:06:54,240 --> 02:06:54,960
OK.

3566
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:55,440
The cat is really cute.

3567
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:56,560
Extra stars for the cat.

3568
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:56,960
Yeah.

3569
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:58,400
There's four stars for the cat.

3570
02:06:58,400 --> 02:06:59,840
Four stars because of the cat.

3571
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:01,920
Because of the cat.

3572
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:04,720
Oh my God.

3573
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:12,560
Oh, that looks really good.

3574
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:14,320
Oh, the throat, you see that?

3575
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:15,840
You're layered on layers.

3576
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:18,080
Yeah.

3577
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:20,400
You guys don't see the throat glitch?

3578
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:20,960
The throat?

3579
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:21,520
What?

3580
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:21,760
No.

3581
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:23,200
It's like glitching between black and

3582
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:23,840
and it's like.

3583
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:25,680
Oh, it doesn't have a dragon.

3584
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:26,320
What is this?

3585
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:27,200
Go away.

3586
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:29,040
Who's doing this?

3587
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:30,080
Yeah, how do you do that?

3588
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:30,720
What the hell?

3589
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:33,840
That is going on.

3590
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:35,760
You got to go the slay one.

3591
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:38,320
Yola, let's go.

3592
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:38,960
Let's go.

3593
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:39,600
Nice.

3594
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:43,040
Oh my gosh.

3595
02:07:43,040 --> 02:07:43,680
All right.

3596
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:45,600
Alrighty.

3597
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:46,160
Thank you.

3598
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:48,720
Where's everybody?

3599
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:50,640
Let's be together.

3600
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:51,680
Oh, yeah.

3601
02:07:51,680 --> 02:07:52,640
Let's all get together.

3602
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:52,880
All right.

3603
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:53,600
Where are we?

3604
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:54,000
Where are we?

3605
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:54,960
Your face is on.

3606
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:56,880
Hi.

3607
02:07:56,880 --> 02:07:57,360
Where should we?

3608
02:07:57,920 --> 02:07:59,040
In the white makey mound.

3609
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:02,240
There you go.

3610
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:03,600
All right.

3611
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:04,640
Everyone.

3612
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:05,280
Pose pose.

3613
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:06,720
Number 12.

3614
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:07,520
Oh, pose.

3615
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:08,480
Number 12.

3616
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:09,280
OK, OK, OK.

3617
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:10,800
There we go.

3618
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:11,360
Wait, wait.

3619
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:11,680
I got a.

3620
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:13,440
OK.

3621
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:13,840
There we go.

3622
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:15,040
Oh, beautiful.

3623
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:17,200
Adorable.

3624
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:19,440
Nice.

3625
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:20,480
Who are these people?

3626
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:20,720
Move.

3627
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:23,440
Oh, God.

3628
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:23,920
Oh, my God.

3629
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:24,400
I got my help.

3630
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:25,120
I'm here.

3631
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:25,920
Like, I'm hitching.

3632
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:26,400
Look at you.

3633
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:26,800
Oh, no.

3634
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:27,600
Why is it got?

3635
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:28,160
Oh, no.

3636
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:29,440
There you go.

3637
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:29,760
Nice.

3638
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:31,040
Nice.

3639
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:33,360
They're getting in my face.

3640
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:35,440
I'm trying to take a screenshot.

3641
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:36,480
Oh, me too.

3642
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:38,400
They know what I'm going to do,

3643
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:39,200
madam said.

3644
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:43,360
Oh, they did a screenshot.

3645
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:43,840
Brett.

3646
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:45,360
Why are they all here?

3647
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:46,400
Everybody's here.

3648
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:50,160
It's everyone watching the stream.

3649
02:08:52,160 --> 02:08:53,680
It's everyone we're playing with

3650
02:08:53,680 --> 02:08:55,600
actually, like, our viewers.

3651
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:56,400
Hi, guys.

3652
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:58,080
All right.

3653
02:08:58,640 --> 02:08:58,880
All right.

3654
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:00,880
Thank you, guys.

3655
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:02,160
Thank you, guys, for playing.

3656
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:03,280
Thank you for playing.

3657
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:03,600
Thank you.

3658
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:06,320
Hope you guys enjoyed.

3659
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:08,400
Welcome to Roblox.

3660
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:08,720
Yeah.

3661
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:10,560
Thank you so much for inviting Roblox.

3662
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:10,640
Yeah.

3663
02:09:10,640 --> 02:09:12,160
Thank you for inviting me.

3664
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:12,320
Yeah.

3665
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:13,200
Yeah.

3666
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:14,160
All right.

3667
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:15,200
Bye-bye.

3668
02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:16,000
Bye-bye.

3669
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,440
Have a good day, guys.

3670
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:17,920
Bye.

3671
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:18,240
Thank you.

3672
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:23,040
Okay, I'm going to leave the game.

3673
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:25,120
Leave.

3674
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:27,200
Leave.

3675
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:30,560
And then let me go back to the chatting screen.

3676
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:39,360
That was interesting.

3677
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:42,480
That was my first time ever actually playing Roblox.

3678
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:44,000
I'm kind of sad.

3679
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:50,880
I bought a cute little avatar before we started

3680
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:53,920
because I thought, like, I could use it, but I can't.

3681
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:55,840
Here, let me show you what she looks like.

3682
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:56,560
That's her.

3683
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:57,760
Look how cute she is.

3684
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:58,880
I couldn't use her at all.

3685
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:02,160
Look how cute she is.

3686
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:05,760
Also, do not send me friend requests on Roblox.

3687
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:07,040
I will not accept them.

3688
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:08,080
Same thing with Discord.

3689
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:10,000
I keep getting Discord friend requests.

3690
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,120
I will not accept them.

3691
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:14,000
But look how cute.

3692
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:14,800
That's me.

3693
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:15,920
Okay, I didn't make this.

3694
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:18,480
I bought it for $7, but it's so cute.

3695
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:21,120
She does have some stompers.

3696
02:10:21,120 --> 02:10:22,560
They are really big, but it's really cute.

3697
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:25,360
I know I couldn't use her.

3698
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:27,600
You mugged everyone in the room?

3699
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:29,360
Not really.

3700
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:32,880
Not really.

3701
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,000
But I did have fun.

3702
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,360
I enjoyed myself.

3703
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:40,160
I enjoyed playing Roblox.

3704
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:44,160
Much more than I expected to, to be honest.

3705
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:48,560
Much more than I put a lot more effort than I expected to put.

3706
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:51,920
I tried really hard to make it look good.

3707
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:54,080
It was a fun stream.

3708
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:55,280
I'm glad you liked it.

3709
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:57,040
I'm glad you liked it.

3710
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:04,160
No, you're cultivating your fan base with fashionists kids now.

3711
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:06,080
No, no, don't.

3712
02:11:06,640 --> 02:11:09,920
I don't know who said go subscribe to Amy in the chat,

3713
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:11,040
but don't do that.

3714
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:14,000
Roblox is full of kids.

3715
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:17,280
I, I, I don't, we don't, we don't, we don't, we don't, we don't

3716
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:17,680
want to invite.

3717
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:18,880
Oh, sorry.

3718
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:20,080
I'm clicking on my keyboard back.

3719
02:11:20,080 --> 02:11:21,760
So we don't invite kids to this stream.

3720
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:22,640
We don't invite kids.

3721
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:25,120
Kids, kids are not allowed in the stream.

3722
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:25,440
Okay.

3723
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:26,960
Um, yeah.

3724
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:29,120
You should have won that Justin round.

3725
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:31,200
Justin looked bad.

3726
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:34,240
Justin looked ugly.

3727
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:37,280
I shouldn't have.

3728
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:39,520
I should have picked someone else, but

3729
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:44,160
um, I, I didn't know who to pick and I thought Justin would be easy.

3730
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:48,480
Not even to teach about the dangers of airplanes.

3731
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:51,200
No, for nothing.

3732
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:53,280
Kids are not allowed here for anything.

3733
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:55,920
Do you still have VC?

3734
02:11:56,480 --> 02:12:00,800
No, I don't know how to VC in Roblox, but I just wanted to,

3735
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:04,080
I thought it would be funny to troll on the kids a little bit, but uh,

3736
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:07,920
I don't even know how it's fine.

3737
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:09,520
The kids discovering porn things.

3738
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:14,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3739
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:15,200
We don't do that.

3740
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:17,360
I don't even know what that word means.

3741
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:18,640
What, what is that?

3742
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:20,400
I've never done anything like that.

3743
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:23,920
Don't accuse me of things I, I don't do.

3744
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:24,240
Okay.

3745
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:33,520
Just like a tanked up or baggy shirt and buzz cut for what?

3746
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:34,320
For Justin Bieber.

3747
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:36,400
I tried going for like his younger years.

3748
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:38,880
That's more, um, that's more iconic.

3749
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:42,720
You know, yeah.

3750
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:48,160
Let's see.

3751
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:48,400
Oops.

3752
02:12:48,400 --> 02:12:50,240
This is not the right tab.

3753
02:12:57,360 --> 02:12:59,520
She's going to raise the next generation of Cooners.

3754
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:01,600
No, we're not raising anyone.

3755
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:03,200
We're not raising no kids here.

3756
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:04,320
Absolutely not.

3757
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:07,040
Is he alive right now?

3758
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:08,640
Is he dead?

3759
02:13:08,640 --> 02:13:09,280
Did he die?

3760
02:13:10,240 --> 02:13:10,960
Is he alive?

3761
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:13,200
Here, hold on.

3762
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:17,840
I am a bad, I thought I, hold on.

3763
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:32,400
Oh, thank you for the $15.

3764
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:32,800
Thank you.

3765
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:36,560
Rui's not streaming.

3766
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:38,480
Did she finish the stream?

3767
02:13:40,720 --> 02:13:42,000
Yeah, she finished the stream.

3768
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:43,680
Um,

3769
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:51,200
and Alaya.

3770
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:53,920
Don't tell them, but I forgot to subscribe to them on YouTube.

3771
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:55,280
I'm literally doing that right now.

3772
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:57,280
Oh, they all ended the stream already.

3773
02:13:59,120 --> 02:13:59,360
Okay.

3774
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:02,000
I will also-

3775
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,280
Alaya, fuck Elia.

3776
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:03,760
Sorry.

3777
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:04,480
Oh, sorry.

3778
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:04,800
Sorry.

3779
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:05,600
Alaya, Alaya.

3780
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:17,040
Amy would never do anything on Seiso on YouTube.

3781
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:19,200
No, no, I wouldn't.

3782
02:14:22,240 --> 02:14:24,880
Anyways, Strani's still streaming right now.

3783
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:26,240
She's playing Tavern Master.

3784
02:14:26,240 --> 02:14:27,360
So I'm going to read her.

3785
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:32,800
Um, I'm going to just put the link in chat.

3786
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:34,320
Oops, I'm going to put the link in chat.

3787
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:38,960
I, okay, I am having a really bad tummy ache.

3788
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:42,560
So I don't think I'll be, I don't think I'll be in chat.

3789
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:44,240
I will be on the toilet.

3790
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:46,160
I'm feeling it really hit right now.

3791
02:14:46,160 --> 02:14:48,000
And I'm wondering if it's from my coffee,

3792
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,280
because I did drink coffee this morning.

3793
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:50,880
Oh my God, it's really hitting me.

3794
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:54,800
Um, um, yeah, okay.

3795
02:14:54,800 --> 02:15:00,480
I'll see you tomorrow, I think.

3796
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:03,200
I think tomorrow.

3797
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:06,800
Um, yes, thank you for coming.

3798
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:07,920
We'll see you tomorrow.

3799
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:09,760
Have a nice day.

3800
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:11,920
This is so strange to stream so early in the day.

3801
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:12,960
I never stream this early.

3802
02:15:14,720 --> 02:15:18,000
Um, also someone, I remember someone said like,

3803
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,080
doesn't, Amy, Amy, Amy's on Twitter

3804
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:22,400
while she's on the toilet, isn't she?

3805
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:23,600
And you're right.

3806
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:25,920
I am on Twitter while I'm on the toilet.

3807
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:27,520
I'm on Twitter on the toilet a lot.

3808
02:15:28,160 --> 02:15:30,720
I'll probably be on Twitter on the toilet right now.

3809
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:36,480
I, I do, I do be on the toilet.

3810
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:39,520
I'll be tweeting and shitting.

3811
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:45,920
How do I, I will set up the raid,

3812
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:47,280
but I don't think it's going to work.

3813
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:51,200
So I will do, I will also just give you the link.

3814
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:54,400
There.

3815
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:56,320
All right.

3816
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:57,600
See you tomorrow, hopefully.

3817
02:15:57,600 --> 02:15:59,440
If I'm getting the date right, I think.

3818
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:02,560
Yeah, tomorrow's a member stream though.

3819
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:05,920
So if you're not a member, see you Saturday.

3820
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:07,920
Have a good day.

3821
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:11,600
Thank you for watching me play Roblox.

3822
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:16,240
Um, yeah, see ya.

3823
02:16:16,240 --> 02:16:16,960
Bye-bye.

3824
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:17,440
Love you.

3825
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:55,380
Bye.
