22
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,480

25
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
You really want to know the Lord

26
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Did you know that you can have okay? I have a health condition, right? Okay, and yes

27
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,320
I'm shouting this out to the high heavens. Hi pin pals. I'm sorry. You have to find out this way

28
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,880
There's this medical condition called a retroverted uterus

29
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,240
Mmm

30
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,880
Have you heard of that? I think you told me about it. Yeah, it's when your uterus is flipped backwards

31
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,720
Yeah, and it's painful and so my periods are painful. Oh

32
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,480
And so it hurts to put in like a tampon or something

33
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,200
Yes, like it doesn't go into your uterus obviously, but it can

34
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,040
affect

35
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Your kidney meow meow

36
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Oh

37
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,560
retro coochie

38
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,480
Does that mean instead of an innie it's an ellie?

39
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
Yes, yes it does

40
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Is it twisted around there is

41
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,480
Like okay, so they the only reason I know this is because they give you like a what is it like a CT scan?

42
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,000
Where they like see all your insights? Mm-hmm, and then

43
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,440
They have like on the paperwork like what what they find in your body, and they always say yeah

44
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,320
Mimosa has a her uterus is backwards, but that's okay. I

45
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:24,160
Heard I heard that thing can happen with like all of your organs too. I've yeah, I've heard of that too

46
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
I think there's a disease where you can

47
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,840
Be born with your organs on the wrong side of your body. Yeah, I've heard of that condition

48
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
Um

49
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
All right, well I like to use

50
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
period cups

51
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,880
Because oh, I'm kind of lazy, and I don't like having to constantly like buy

52
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,560
more pads and stuff and

53
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,600
So that way like I just boil the cup to clean it

54
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,120
And I just I just put it in and it's it's nice because I don't have to change it as often and also

55
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,200
I don't know if you feel this way, but with pads like

56
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,240
It gets really sweaty down there, and it gets really damp and hot

57
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:15,280
Like the moistness is so uncomfortable for me and every time you like sit down and it like squelches against you

58
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,800
Do you get that?

59
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,300
Yeah, I used to get really heavy periods

60
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,480
Yeah, I hate that feeling so much so I can't handle it

61
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Would you ever sell the the water?

62
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,600
What water? Oh like the water that you boil it in? Yeah. Oh

63
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,480
The water that I boil the cup in? Yeah

64
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Maybe I

65
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,880
Think that might be a health hazard, but I think if I well you boiled it so the bacteria is gone I

66
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,280
Guess I

67
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,760
Guess just don't disclose it to the you know the postal service that it's coochie water

68
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,800
Yeah, do you think they would I think they had sent it back to your hat. No, they'd probably dispose of it

69
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,200
Yeah, but it's just water. I guess at the end of the day

70
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
I never used a cup though

71
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:21,360
Like you you don't put the you don't put the cup in with blood into the into the water when you boil it

72
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
No, no, but there could be chunks

73
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,840
You don't get those I do get clots, but I'm saying like it's not gonna be in the water that I sent to viewers

74
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,120
Why not?

75
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,760
I want I want clots and all you want clots and all yeah, you want that soup

76
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
The Emmy broth, yeah

77
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
It adds some texture

78
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:03,280
That's pretty gross I heard that you can get like clots like I don't know what what it's called but like

79
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,040
the clots like it's basically when your whole

80
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:14,080
Uterus uterine line comes like comes off in like one big chunk and it's like uterus shaped

81
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,400
Have you ever gotten those ones? No, I feel like that would hurt

82
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,600
I feel like it would I've never gotten it

83
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,960
But I looked at pictures of it and it's literally like a mini uterus and it's like a blood clot from a period

84
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,440
Yeah, what's it called? Hold on. Let me check I

85
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Need to see this

86
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640

87
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Uterus screenshot if you will yeah, it's like a screenshot

88
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:55,880
Google just shy to show me period blood clots in general. That's not enough

89
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Oh here

90
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360

91
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,020
Do you want to see the picture hell yeah, yeah

92
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,480
I'll take a look. I'll take a ganda. It's like it looks like Jell-O

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:30,480
Oh, no, it says upload failed something went wrong. It doesn't is it like should I send you a Google Drive link?

94
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,440
Sure, why not? I don't know. Maybe

95
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,800
This court is this court is trying to censor me. Yeah, does that have like a filter? It does but you can turn it off

96
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,280
Hmm

97
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,960
Somebody somebody gave me $10 and they said that they want us to kiss. I don't know if that's enough. Sorry, but thank you

98
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,360
Come here

99
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
It looked like a giant

100
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,320
I fixed it a little bit. Okay now your head your skull is so what is up with your cranium?

101
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,200
Oh my god, I like how you have a dent in your head. Yeah, I also have the headphone

102
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Dents

103
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
The gamer dance

104
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,540
I'm such a huge gamer. So I have a gamer then. Oh, it's a web p-file. Oh my

105
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,540
Oh

106
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:56,260
That's like the size of your palm that's insane. Yeah, your uterus is kind of small. Yeah

107
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:04,020
Yeah, I feel like people don't know how small uterus really is it's like a little baby organ. Yeah, it's not that big

108
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,020
Very small

109
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,540
Yeah, I don't like web p-files. I think they're lame

110
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,460
Yeah, I hate when I try to download an image in it. That's what happened

111
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,260
I tried to download the picture itself, but it gave me a fucking web p-file fucking web p's

112
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,900
It's to stop us from stealing images off the internet

113
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,780
Really? Oh, I don't know

114
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,860
Is that is that's the point of them? No, I don't know. I'm just guessing

115
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,580
I'm just guessing

116
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:39,380
The true question is does it taste like Jill? Have you tried your period blood? Have you tried period blood in general?

117
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,940
Yes, you have

118
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,020
Yeah

119
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,660
Iron it tastes like iron. Why did you try metal? Wait? Why did you try it?

120
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,580
Because I've tasted everything else. Why wouldn't I taste my blood?

121
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,980
Your period blood specifically. Yeah. Yes

122
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,780
What's the story behind this? I got it on my fingers and I sucked it off

123
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,860
How did you get it on your fingers?

124
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,980
wiping

125
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,540
Different okay, it's different

126
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,980
What?

127
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,740
Yours, okay, you're seriously not lying. I'm dead ass

128
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,860
I've tasted my own pee. I've tasted my own Gabagoo, and I've tasted my own blood and my period blood

129
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,940
Tasted your own pee. Yeah, why?

130
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:55,820
Well, what if what okay the reason why is what if I'm in a like life-or-death scenario and I have to drink my pee

131
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,980
Maybe I am

132
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,740
I need to get used to it

133
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:13,300
Did you forget to pay your water bill when they shut off your water and you got thirsty? I'm so confused

134
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,140
That actually has happened before but no

135
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,180
But no, you didn't okay. So what how did you taste your own pee?

136
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:28,620
What pee in a cup like did you just have the idea pop in your head one day? I

137
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,620
Guess I mean

138
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:38,020
Pee is okay. I like pee. Do you have long-term memory loss? Tell me the story about how you tasted your own pee

139
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,020
I don't know. I was a kid

140
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,340
It's personal it's lemonade on the go exactly. Oh

141
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,540
Well, then how did you know you did it if you don't remember it as a kid did your parents tell you I

142
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,740
Was the freaky kid I

143
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,420
Can imagine

144
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,420
Were you one of the freaky kids?

145
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,660
Not really not that I know of I would try to run away from my parents all the time though in public

146
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,700
I was kind of a kid that needed to be on a leash, but they didn't have child leashes at the time

147
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,980
Yeah, so I

148
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,700
Wasn't allowed to leave the house much because I would try to run away

149
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:29,060
Like run away run away or just yeah, like run away like I would I would I would just leave my parents

150
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,060
I would run away from them

151
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Yeah, we gotta put you on a leash

152
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,860
Holy crap, I

153
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,820
I

154
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:47,460
Don't know. I was I had when I was growing up. I had like the the anxious attachment style with my parents

155
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,660
But then I got traumatized and I was like leave me alone. I don't need you

156
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,580
You well, how did you get traumatized?

157
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,300
That is that is a stream and it's

158
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,580
The trauma has been dumped dump it the train you don't want to it's up to you

159
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,140
I mean, it's not my members stream, but if you guys want the TLDR my mom is insane

160
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,340
Okay, and then you didn't you weren't attached to your parents anymore

161
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,980
It's my my

162
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,580
What's it called my villain arc or whatever your villain origin story? Yeah, pretty much

163
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:36,380
Okay, I feel like a lot of villains have like bad parents. So just check it out. That's true. Are you a villain now? I

164
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:43,260
Feel like I'm more of an anti hero, but I'll take I'll take the villain. Why not nobody else wants to be the villain

165
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Fine, I'll do it myself

166
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,580
What would you be do you feel like a main character? No, I'm a background character

167
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
Really? Yeah

168
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:04,420
Yeah, I'm the background that I can't you you think of yourself that way. Yeah

169
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,260
That's really sad

170
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,100
Why why are you a side character? I don't know because I don't do anything

171
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:26,540
Like I feel like I only leave my house if another main character needs me to be in the background

172
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,900
Like your piano teacher

173
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,940
Yeah, I

174
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:38,100
Used to have a piano teacher who would do the same thing as yours. Just ignore me when I was at the door

175
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:44,980
Oh, no, she doesn't ignore me. She just told me like it was both of our faults. She texted me saying she

176
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:51,580
She would be available, you know that week and I never answered her to confirm

177
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:56,100
I just kind of left her on red and then I came that week and I was like hey

178
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,500
I'm here because you said you'd be available and she's like, oh shit. Sorry. I meant

179
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,980
I meant the the next week or something like that like it's both of our fault

180
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:12,900
Yeah, she told you walk all the way there, right? Well, no, I take the bus and then I walk like the other half of the way

181
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,260
Yeah, that's miserable

182
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:21,380
It is especially in the heat, but it's okay because it's literally the only exercise I get when I quit my job

183
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,860
My mom was literally like you get no fucking exercise and you're gonna get fat if you quit this job

184
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,140
It's good for me to have exercise

185
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:36,220
So that's why I I you know I I stay with this teacher because she's nice even though she's far away

186
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,820
I need I need to I need a little bit of exercise

187
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,660
That's fair

188
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,940
Do you do you ever disclose what you used to do for work, or is that a secret?

189
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:51,340
Um, I haven't talked about it on this channel, but I can talk about it. I

190
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,300
Know it's not a secret

191
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,460
It's a secret. I guess so far because I haven't talked about it yet. I oh, I'm excited

192
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,340
Is it interesting no not at all

193
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,140
Well, okay, my job history goes in high school

194
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,340
I like did a free internship as a tutor

195
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,980
For like a tutoring service

196
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,340
Kind of like kumon, but like less depressing. Wow

197
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,700
um

198
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,700
Not that wow

199
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,500
and then

200
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,220
After that my first job that I actually got paid for was at a grocery store during cold bed

201
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:42,540
Oh, and then after that I switched to another grocery store still during COVID and then finally I ended it off at a

202
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,940
drug store

203
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:51,020
Like at a cuban store, and that's that's that's the gist of all the jobs I've had so far

204
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,220
And I have not yeah, that's not very interesting

205
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,340
I

206
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,580
Thought I thought you're gonna say something like

207
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,780
Yeah, I don't know I don't know what I was expecting

208
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,860
What's your job history I

209
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:16,940
My first ever job was at a taco place and I quit within two weeks because they were paying me under minimum wage

210
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,940
It was under the table or something or

211
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:29,060
So it was in the state of Texas and Texas has this law where if they put if an employer puts you on like a

212
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:36,060
Probationary period they can pay you under minimum wage. Are you serious? Yeah, and I was a kid. I didn't know anybody

213
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,060
So they pretended to put you on some stupid probation

214
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:47,500
Yeah, so it's like you work here for I think it was a 60 or 90 60 or 90 days

215
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,780
I can't remember and then they're like it then we'll bump you up to minimum wage. Oh

216
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:56,260
I know about that. I remember when I first got my job. I it was like because I was under age

217
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,580
They were allowed to pay me under minimum wage. Yeah, I think I think that's how it works

218
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:09,100
It is screwed up because we might be miners, but we're still working just as hard as the adults like what the fuck

219
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,800
It's messed up. They hate the children. They really hate the children

220
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:22,880
Valid you fall for at first sight. No, Emmys don't fall for the minor. No, she was not the cute

221
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,920
Do not fall for cashier in me

222
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:40,480
But I I worked it. Okay, I don't think I've said this out loud. I worked at water burger. Oh, no

223
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
I

224
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,700
Yeah, we don't have water burger in Canada. Is it good? No, you don't it is so good people say it's mid

225
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,700
But it's like comfort food to me as a Texan

226
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:59,160
Is it like cheap is that why people say it's mid because I know here a lot of people say that Burger King sucks

227
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,720
As because it's really cheap, but Burger King is also like a comfort food to me

228
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah, it's it's not cheap, but it's

229
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Better than McDonald's is how I feel

230
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,240
Mmm

231
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,760
Gotta say her accent seems rather mild for a text. I'm sorry. You want me to talk like this

232
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,720
This is how my mama talks my mama talks like this really

233
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,600
Yeah, my mom my mom is uh

234
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:33,760
She's not a southern bail, but she is uh, she's southern. So do you have that accent too and you're just covering it? I

235
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,760
Have it. I just uh, I don't say I'm covering it, but

236
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,680
It slips out sometimes if you pay attention

237
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Okay, okay

238
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,320
You have an accent

239
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,280
No, I have I only have a little sister voice and big sister voice

240
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,200
I don't have I don't have any sort of accent. My mom has an accent though

241
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:04,640
which is strange because my dad doesn't have an accent even though they're both from the same country and

242
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,640
Came here at the same time in Canada. I don't know

243
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,720
Palais vous Francais

244
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,520
Oui

245
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,400
There I have a shitty Canadian accent when I speak French. I

246
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,800
Mean I'm not Canadian nor do I speak French so I can't hear it

247
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,360
That's so hard to to s

248
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
Francais no

249
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,920
No, she's not French. No

250
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:43,120
Thank God people think I'm French French Canadian. No, no, my family's not from France. She's just Canadian

251
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:52,840
You sound like you would make a great real gone cover, what's real gone is that like a Texas like a country song?

252
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:02,480
Real gone. I'll look it up. Can you sing the fucking I dug my key into the side of his can you sing that song?

253
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,920
I could sing that

254
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,760
It goes like that one

255
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
Why do you know that song better than me

256
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
You're a fake Texan

257
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,680
It looks like it

258
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,600
Yeah, people think that all Texans have like a they all talk like this. It's not true

259
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,960
There's plenty of I mean the further south you go. They do talk like this

260
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,440
But when you're in northern Texas like I was they don't talk like this

261
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,000
I see is Texas near Alabama

262
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,960
Yeah, yeah, have you much yeah, have you met any Alabamian Alabamians that?

263
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
I

00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,560
Committed committed what?

265
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Tell me

266
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,720
Yes, yes, I have a story about that

267
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:17,280
Tell me I have a story I have a so my family is pretty much from the southern like the Bible belt basically

268
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,600
I have some cousins from Alabama and

269
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,560
I've never told this story on stream. I have a male cousin

270
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Do we see where this is going right?

271
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,040
No, I was a minor. He was an adult and he sent me he sent me photos

272
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,920
Yes

273
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,600
Sweet home Alabama wait of what? Mm-hmm his wee wee his cock

274
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,240
16 by the way it was 24

275
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Yeah, I'm sorry you have to hear this

276
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,040
I

277
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,280
Don't know he was a weirdo. I guess I don't I don't know I haven't spoken to him since that

278
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,280
victim

279
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,320
This is why I feel like I'm a background character because I don't have crazy stories like this

280
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
Drake

281
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,480
It was not that big

282
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,720
Like four inches it was hard. Yes

283
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:50,040
I really I don't know we we went on the lore behind that as we went on like a family reunion

284
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,760
And we went to Alabama like Mississippi and Alabama to see our family

285
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,360
And he said he attacks me on Facebook Messenger and he was like memosa your boobs are so big

286
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,520
I was like, oh

287
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,840
Thanks, I guess

288
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,480
I'm 16 by the way

289
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,400
He said be he said me wee wee pigs. Yeah

290
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:21,040
And yeah, he the thing is he would ignore me in person, but he would text me weird things

291
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,440
What the fuck oh my god Lulu is here. Hi

292
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,120
What's my queen? She's my queen too a daddy party

00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,080
What the fuck the only

294
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:44,760
The only sort of weird thing I have like that is that when I was like really really young I had I have three

295
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,200
Cousins and one of them is much older than the rest of us

296
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,960
And he was like guys, do you want to see something? I found he was probably like 13 or something

297
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
He was like guys. Do you want to see something? I found

298
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:02,680
And he he brought out a camera and he opened it and it was pictures

299
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:09,800
Like oh my god. I've never talked about this before you there. It was pictures of his mom and and her boyfriend

300
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,520
Dylan each

301
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,440
You just found them

302
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,160
That would change my brain chemistry, that's disgusting

303
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,360
That is so gross

304
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,360
I

305
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,320
What did you do I would cry he offered to send he sent the pictures

306
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,240
We just laughed at it cuz we thought it was funny. That's so why 2k

307
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,360
I

308
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,000
Have you ever caught your parents doing something like that?

309
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:29,720
No, but my mom and her boyfriend were never secretive about it like literally I would just be in the kitchen

310
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,600
And I would just start hearing them go at it. It was it was not fun

311
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:44,000
Cuz I was like I can't I can't do this anymore. Yeah, I don't blame you. That's really fucking gross

312
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,320
Oh, yeah, who my parents used to have scheduled sex

313
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,380
Yeah, because my dad takes pills

314
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,380
Oh, and he needs time

315
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:16,060
Yeah, would it be on like the family calendar or something would it be like in the Google calendar that's shared between each other

316
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,140
I don't know but

317
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,820
It first started when I was like 19 like 18 or 19

318
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:31,100
I guess they were getting back into their sex life and their the master bedroom was directly above my bedroom

319
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,060
I heard everything

320
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:42,740
The bed shaking the moaning the clapping yes

321
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:54,860
Never heard my parents once in my life that is a good thing. Let's keep it that way. Yeah looking lucky. I

322
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,820
Am

323
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,820
traumatized

324
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,020
August 3rd 4 p.m. Spent time with the Mrs.

325
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,300
Yeah, I have very weird parents

326
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,420
My parents are mostly normal

327
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,700
Wow, I can't relate to that at all

328
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,220
It's the rest of my family. That's messed up

329
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,620
Do you have a least favorite family member?

330
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,820
Least favorite I do but I can't well. Yeah, it's my dad

331
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:44,860
No, you're real for that my least favorite is my mom, so yeah, I can say why cuz I don't really I don't talk to him anymore

332
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,540
mm-hmm, but basically

333
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:54,380
His dream was always to move to America, right, right, so

334
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,460
He

335
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:05,300
So my mom and okay, both of them were really really like broke like really really broke and so

336
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,860
They lived at his grandparents house in a different country, right and

337
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:18,300
So first somehow he got the chance to not go to America, but he got the chance to come to Canada

338
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,300
And so he was like, okay

339
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,580
Yeah, even though, you know, I have like a eight-month-old son over here

340
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:32,100
I'm gonna dip and go to Canada alone without my mom and so that's what he did

341
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,820
illegally

342
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:41,500
And then my mom was like, I think she finally had enough money, so she went alone

343
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,620
to meet up with him and then

344
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,820
You know eventually they shipped over the rest of the children

345
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:01,220
And luckily I was born in Canada though, oh, okay, yeah

346
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,700
I was born in Canada, so I didn't have to get shipped over

347
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:09,340
But eventually we did get shipped back to our home country because my mom was like

348
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,740
I can't handle these kids alone because my dad wasn't helping

349
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:20,380
My dad wasn't helping so she shipped us back typical for the grandparents to take care of us for a while and

350
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,820
While the grandparents were taking care of us, I think they got a divorce at that point

351
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,940
Not even a divorce you didn't want to pay for a divorce and he threatened to

352
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,220
like

353
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:43,020
Leave forever and like disappear like he threatened to disappear, right? He was like if you try if you try to

354
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,900
You know divorce me and get child support

355
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:54,860
I will leave and you'll never see me again. Yeah, your children will never see their dad again. And so

356
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,740
This is crazy in me lore and so she was like, okay fine

357
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,060
I won't divorce you and I won't get child support from you either because you know, we're not divorced

358
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,700
Yeah

359
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,380
And then finally when we were shipped back back home

360
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:20,740
My mom just took care of all of her kids alone without him and without child support

361
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
Really sad

362
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,540
Really that would fuck me up for life and I met him every once in a while

363
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:36,220
But he was always just kind of an asshole and I never liked him because like every time I would meet him

364
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,900
He would like criticize me

365
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,180
He'd be like, oh your shirt doesn't look good or like I don't know

366
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,220
He'd say something to criticize me like I liked I don't know

367
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,620
I liked my hair long and he'd always be like no you have to cut it short or like, you know

368
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:54,780
Why are you wearing that shirt? It's not it's not appropriate or like the way you're dressing isn't appropriate for school

369
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,900
Even though I was a kid and I was just wearing little kids clothes

370
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,900
He wanted me to dress like fancy or something

371
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,260
That's weird. He's a weird fucking guy. I don't like him

372
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,900
Yeah, I don't like him either. I'm gonna punch him through the screen

373
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,980
Yeah, I wish I could punch him, but um, I

374
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,220
Don't want to beat up an old man, I guess

375
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:24,660
What it's what he deserves it is but you know, I don't want to go to jail for beating up an old man

376
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,180
Elderly abuse. Yeah, elderly abuse

377
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:35,740
Why do you hate your mom that is a loaded quote you want to know the tea

378
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:45,900
There's a lot of floors surrounding my mom, but she used to like beat me and kind of like rip my hair out over like church stuff

379
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:53,940
My dad was a little bit like that too, but not as bad not as bad. I didn't get the worst of it for sure

380
00:37:55,060 --> 00:38:00,580
Oh, man, I def I definitely did I was the last one in the house. So I got the brunt of it. Oh

381
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,980
I'm so sorry

382
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:08,100
It's okay. It gives you character. It does a little bit. It does. That's why we're here today

383
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,660
We're trauma dumping

384
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,260
We really are supposed to be girls talk

385
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:22,500
Yeah, I mean, I guess this technically is girls talk. Yeah

386
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:27,980
We're girls talking sad girl sad girl hours. Yeah, exactly

387
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:37,340
This is what girls talk about we talk about our trauma and our periods and what else do we talk about

388
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,780
What is fucking

389
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,460
Makeup

390
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,980
I do wear makeup. Yeah, I don't wear a lot

391
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:56,700
I used to be really into it back in like the like the 2016 makeup era

392
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,340
Oh, God with the with the crazy brows

393
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,060
Yeah, I had eyebrow blindness

394
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,300
I think I might have a picture

395
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,820
I had two types of eyebrow blindness

396
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:17,100
I went through two phases one when I one where I drew them on really really thick and dark

397
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:22,700
And then another phase where I shaved them off and I couldn't tell that I shaved off too much

398
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,700
And I just kept shaving

399
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,940
You thought you looked anime

400
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:42,340
Yeah, I thought I looked cool and anime with my eyebrows like very like very very little eyebrows just at the front a

401
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,340
Little bit. I thought it looked anime

402
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:50,140
Like how you look right now on the screen. Yeah, we'll worsen this honestly, but yeah. Oh, wow

403
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:56,820
Like sperm eyebrows. No, not sperm like just completely off and other than like oh my god

404
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,860
That's I that's so I've been too scared to shave my eyebrows. Well, they grow back

405
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:08,340
They do but what if they what if they take forever? No, they don't they don't take a long time at all

406
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:15,060
Yeah, they grow back really really fast and I have very little eyebrow hair to begin with and they always grow back pretty fast

407
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:20,780
Like if you're fucking I don't know have you tried shaving your mustache or like your sideburns or you're like

408
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:25,220
I don't know any other. I don't know like your your belly. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah

409
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,620
Yeah, if that grows back then your eyebrows will totally grow back too

410
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,340
It's fun to play with them and that way and it's not as stressful that as like

411
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,660
Waxing them because maybe with waxing they might not come back. I don't know that yeah

412
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,700
I've heard that if you pluck them or you wax them too much. They don't come back after a while

413
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,740
Yeah, I heard of that too

414
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,380
The shaving is different because you don't get rid of like

415
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:57,860
Falakul or whatever Falakul Falakul Falakul. Yeah. Oh, I'm doing that. How do you do you just shave regularly?

416
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,380
Like your legs I try to yeah, like with a razor

417
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:07,940
Yeah, okay, cuz my mom has always used an epilator. Do you know what that is?

418
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,940
And every time she would be like in me come here

419
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,020
Let me let me shave your legs like let me teach you how to use this cuz it's so easy

420
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,340
It hurts so

421
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:26,060
Fucking bad and I'd always tell her mom this hurts like crazy

422
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:30,220
And she'd be like well you'll get used to it and then it won't hurt as much

423
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,340
But it never stopped

424
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:38,700
It's so painful. I don't know why people do that. I'd rather if I had to I'd rather wax them

425
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,620
Yeah, me too, cuz at least then like I don't know it's like all the pain at once

426
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,780
But with an epilator it like pulls your hair out. Yeah one by one

427
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:54,740
It's a little machine that pulls your hair out one by one and it's so fucking painful

428
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,340
Yeah, I I learned my lesson from those

429
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:05,420
I remember they used to advertise some and they're like this is the new quick and easy way to shave your legs without all the hassle

430
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:13,940
No, it hurts so bad not worth it. And also like the rubbing one too. I remember they were advertising that where it's just like like a flat

431
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:18,740
I don't know what it's called like a flat handheld like piece of

432
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:25,020
Plastic or something and they'd be like oh just rub it on your legs, and it'll cut it'll take the hair off

433
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:31,540
But like it never worked unless you like rubbed really really really really hard. Yeah burn your skin off

434
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,940
What the hell have you tried using those ones?

435
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:40,660
No, I I almost fell for it, but then I saw people were saying it's a lot of shit. It is a lot of shit

436
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,660
It is

437
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:50,700
Just be hairy no way. I don't I get overstimulated by hair. Really? Yes

438
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:57,420
Yes, I I can and it's I I don't know what it is. I have like heightened senses because I'm autistic

439
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,280
I don't get overstimulated by it. I just think it looks ugly

440
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,820
It does to be honest

441
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:10,380
Yeah, it looks it just looks ugly. So I liked it when I when I have time

442
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,700
I tried to shave

443
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,860
Maybe not during the winter. Oh

444
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,460
Yeah, that's like the what exception we got to stay warm for the winter. Yeah

445
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,380
Pretty much you know

446
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,900
Have you thought about doing laser? I

447
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,140
I think I

448
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:37,540
Don't know I don't know my I'm blonde naturally, so it's not like you can really see it anyway. Are you lucky bitch?

449
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,980
Mmm

450
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,980
You look you look you bitch. I'm very lucky

451
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:50,640
It's not fair. I all of my like my entire family has dark hair, but somehow they have really really light

452
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,420
Body hair except for me

453
00:43:54,060 --> 00:44:00,180
I have really really dark body hair and and it fucking sucks because you can see every piece of hair on my body

454
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,340
That really sucks

455
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:08,220
So even though like my mom is just as hairy as me, you can't even see it

456
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,420
Yeah, I used to

457
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,100
Okay

458
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,100
Wait, I thought you're ginger though. I

459
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:25,740
Think we've we've broken character a little too much during this stream to have me pretend I'm ginger

460
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,300
Did you think I was actually ginger in real life?

461
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,340
Yes, no, you're fake. I'm fake

462
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:40,540
I'm not ginger. Is it from the pictures I posted? Yes

463
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,380
I'm not actually

464
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,580
Of course it was fake. Of course it was fake

465
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,580
I

466
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:59,380
How often do you get your hair cut? I just kind of myself when I feel like it

467
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:04,580
Same. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I've gotten too much trauma from the hair salon

468
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:11,340
Like every time I've gone and I've asked. Oh my god, my throat is getting clogged up and I've asked for something specific

469
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,340
They never give it to me

470
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:18,460
And so I've just I've just resorted to doing it myself at this point

471
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:26,100
That's how I feel. Yeah, they always take off too much or it looks bad. That reminds me though

472
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:33,860
When I was in seventh grade, I have this horror story from the salon when I was in seventh grade

473
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,900
This is what I was first getting into anime, right? Um, I

474
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:45,540
Saw this one clip I can probably find the clip because it's what inspired my hairstyle in seventh grade

475
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:50,260
And I'll show it to you. Maybe it was it was a it was a clip from this anime

476
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,260
I don't remember the anime, but it was of her dancing in front of the TV

477
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:02,020
Oh, is that where she's doing like a funny dance. It's pretty. Oh, I know that one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

478
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,140
in front of

479
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,140
TV

480
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,140
from uh

481
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:12,340
Mika Kunen de Shinkoke

482
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,300
Um

483
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,180
I don't know. I'll just copy the image just so you have a good uh

484
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,740
visual

485
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,740
So it's this girl, right?

486
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,980
I saw right. Yeah, I remember

487
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,820
I saw that clip and I became inspired and I was like I want that haircut

488
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,820
So I

489
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:38,340
I pardoned my hair myself and I I tied a piece like a fucking rat tail

490
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:44,100
At the back I tied it up because I was like, okay. This is the piece that I want. Um out, you know

491
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,860
Yeah, and I went to the hair salon and I I showed

492
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,820
I showed no

493
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:57,940
I showed her I thought she would judge me for like if I showed her a picture of an anime girl

494
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:06,740
So I tried to find just humans with like like real humans with like a similar hairstyle without the stupid rat tail, right?

495
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,860
Um, and I was like, okay, I want this pic

496
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:14,980
I want this hairstyle, but leave leave the rat tail out like leave the part that I tied off

497
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,020
Out of the haircut like I want it to stay long

498
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,780
And she

499
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,780
She gave it to me

500
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,540
And I was like, yeah, she said yes the hair so

501
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:35,380
She was obviously judging me very heavily and she said yes and see it was like a great clips kind of situation

502
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,460
Like it was like

503
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,340
It was like a really really cheap hair salon

504
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,980
so I came out basically with a

505
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,340
What's it called like a

506
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:52,660
What's like a the rihanna like the what's it called the you know the fucking uh

507
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:56,260
I can't think of the the bowl cut but like long

508
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,380
Look, what's the hairstyle?

509
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,100
I'm not sure

510
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:08,660
I came out I came out with a bob and a rat

511
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:18,260
You poor fucking thing and I still have a picture from my eighth grade graduation photos having a bob and a rat

512
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:27,060
Did anybody bully you for it? Oh, yeah, they did

513
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,100
I got bullied for my hair too in middle school

514
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:35,540
We're complaining except I purposefully chose to have the hairs done

515
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,380
It's my own fault that I got bullied

516
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,940
It's my own

517
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,620
I feel like I had to have been cute. No, it was really bad

518
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,820
It was really I looked really greasy because oh I didn't know how to style it

519
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:00,820
And I don't want ever showed me so I would just use a bunch of hair

520
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:06,420
I gloved it on there to try to make it look as

521
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,820
Yeah, I I actually had a similar story

522
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:27,860
Have you heard of power puff girls z like the the anime version of power puff girls?

523
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,780
I um, I wanted my hair to look like uh

524
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,700
Buttercup like in the anime where she had like the bob thing going on

525
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,540
And so I printed out a pig I was like 10 by the way

526
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:46,500
I printed out a picture of her and I showed my mom mom. This is what I want and she said no

527
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:52,500
And she saved my life that day. She saved your fucking life because my mom said yes

528
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,620
My mom said yes

529
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,140
But I mean it's not terrible. I don't know

530
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,420
But for like a nine-year-old

531
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:08,260
I don't know how they wouldn't it's basically a pixie cut, right?

532
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:12,660
Yeah, kind of it's like spiky. I think yeah spiky on top

533
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:17,940
But I I did have a pixie cut and once I graduated high school. Oh, that's cute

534
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,300
I think pixie cuts can look cute

535
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,900
They can I wasn't very good at styling it though

536
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,900
Yeah

537
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:31,780
Me neither. I used to I I didn't know how to use like well

538
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:36,500
We had a curling iron, but it was so old that I um

539
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,460
It wouldn't heat up enough for me to use it

540
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,900
Is your mouth perpetually open or are you yawning?

541
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,700
I'm yawning. I'm sorry. I just woke up

542
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,380
You noticed

543
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:55,140
That's that's why I keep being quiet because I'm like, uh, it's okay

544
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,180
Um, but yeah, I didn't know how to use a curling iron

545
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,060
But I really wanted more volume in my in my bangs

546
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,340
I had like the emo bangs, but I really wanted more volume

547
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:16,820
This was in like a ninth grade and so I would choose to just braid my bangs in like really really tiny braids every night

548
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,940
In the morning I would undo the braids

549
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:24,500
So that they were really curly, but I have very very straight hair

550
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:28,260
So I just had like really curly bangs

551
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:33,220
And really straight hair for the rest of my head and it looked really bad

552
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,220
But it's all right. Yeah

553
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:43,140
No, I used I used to do something similar where I where I'd only straighten the front pieces of my hair and the back would be

554
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,620
The back would be

555
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,500
Oh

556
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:54,820
What happens is the back of your hair is none of your business. It's really not my business. I can't see it. So it doesn't exist

557
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,980
Yeah, who cares? Yeah

558
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,700
If you can't see it, then fuck you

559
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:07,460
If you can't see it, then it's just don't tell me about it. It doesn't matter. It's not a big deal. Yeah, it's not your business

560
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,540
It's not your business

561
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:14,340
Yeah, I was my hair can't hold a curl though

562
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,700
So I could never curl my hair

563
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,300
Do you have straight hair?

564
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,300
It's like

565
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:27,700
I think I was told it's like a 2a hairstyle or like hair type or whatever

566
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,580
Because there's like different kinds of hair

567
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:35,300
It's like has like a slight wave to it

568
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:41,220
It's what the hairdresser told me. Oh, that's pretty though. Thank you

569
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,260
And when I brush it it gets kind of fluffy

570
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,260
That's pretty

571
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,700
Yeah, I wanted to get a perm but I heard that like fries your hair off

572
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:02,660
Oh, but you only live once so cares if you don't and your hair grows back

573
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:10,340
Yeah, like I definitely have thinning hair because I like kept it dyed for like six years straight

574
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:15,940
But like, you know, you only live once you only have one head of hair once just have fun with it

575
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,260
Do whatever you want. Who cares if it gets damaged

576
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:22,260
That's how I feel like it grows back. Yeah, it grows back

577
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,980
exactly

578
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:30,420
My hair's my hair grows pretty fast anyway, so I won't miss it. Yeah, just get a perm

579
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,860
Okay, I'm gonna do it my I I um

580
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:39,540
I went from bleach blonde to black and now I'm red like a reddish black. So

581
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,340
My hair is about to fall off

582
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:47,300
No, fuck it. We ball. Well, you should definitely tell the hairdresser that your hair

583
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,620
is uh

584
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,740
is

585
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:52,740
You know died like that though

586
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,060
Why should I well because they need to know

587
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:04,500
I don't what if like it could like uh, like snap off if they fry it to know your hair dying history. Yeah, that's true

588
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:09,300
They need to know and at the point I I think I think even if you lie to them, they can find out anyway

589
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,740
Yeah, they'll find out if there's no point something fucks up. They'll find out

590
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:17,940
It's like a doctor. They need to know your medical history. That's true or a dentist. They need to know

591
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,420
Yeah, they need to know you gotta tell them

592
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:27,620
Even though I don't like I don't like hair hair stylists or or you know hair colorists in in general

593
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,660
If you want to go they gotta know

594
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:35,460
I usually just dye my own hair. I don't trust anybody me too

595
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,020
The reason I don't trust anybody is because um

596
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,780
The first time I went to get my hair dyed. I wanted purple

597
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,300
And I showed them like bright purple hair and I was like, this is what I want

598
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:52,020
And we went to a professional place and I was like, this is what I want

599
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,980
And they're like, okay cool

600
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,620
And they come over and they show me a hair sample and they're like

601
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:01,060
We can't really give you that but we can give you this and it was still really purple, right?

602
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:05,940
So I was like, cool. That's fine. I'll take that too. And then I come out of that

603
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,780
salon still having black hair

604
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:15,380
And you know, they showed it to me in the mirror and I was like, oh my god. Thank you so much

605
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:20,340
Oh my god. Thank you. I hate that part when you fucking hate it and you're like, oh, thank you

606
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:25,300
Yeah, thank you so much. Wow. I love it. So it just looked black. Yeah, it was black

607
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:28,740
I went to school the next day and I was like, I told my friends like guys

608
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,700
Do you notice anything different about my hair? And they're like, uh

609
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,980
No

610
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:40,340
And that's sad. It was only like two weeks later that someone

611
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:46,340
Finally at school noticed something was different with my hair and they said, oh my god. Amy. Did you dye your hair brown?

612
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,740
I would cry that would hurt my feeling so bad

613
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:55,860
I did cry and that's that started my um, my saga of dyeing my own hair

614
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:02,260
Yep, I feel like it's so much better because you have so much control and you can

615
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:06,740
You know pick with the color and if it turns out bad, there's only one person to blame

616
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:10,100
It's you yourself. Yeah. Yeah, especially yeah

617
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:16,740
And you don't have to deal with like hair stylist being like, oh, it's gonna damage your hair if you do that

618
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:21,620
Oh, they're always like, yeah, if we bleach your hair, we put dye and it's gonna fry. Well, fuck you, bitch

619
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:27,060
I'm paying you a service. Hey, why die my fucking hair? I'm paying you to fry it. Just fry it

620
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,780
Do it. Do it. I wouldn't do it myself

621
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:36,420
Yeah, exactly and I get to do it for cheaper when it's on my own. So you're missing out, bitch

622
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,460
True. They charge so much money to do

623
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:45,060
I remember I got really lazy once and I didn't want to do my roots

624
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:49,620
It's when I had uh, it's when I had like red hair. I got really lazy. I didn't want to do my roots

625
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,860
So I finally went to a hair salon, right?

626
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,740
And I told them like, hey, I want to do my roots and they were like, uh

627
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:02,900
They didn't I think the lady didn't pay attention. So she was like cool come in, you know, like at six

628
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:09,620
Um, and it'll only be like a hundred dollars and I was like, yo, that's pretty that's a pretty good deal to just get my roots done, right?

629
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,180
That's not bad. Yeah, that's really good deal

630
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:17,780
And it was a nice place and I come in that day and the hairstylist looks at my hair and then she was like, um

631
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:21,700
Actually, it's gonna be three hundred dollars and it's gonna take eight hours

632
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,860
So you have to come tomorrow and I was like

633
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:29,940
Fuck this. I'm just gonna do it myself in four hours. What do you mean? Just for your roots?

634
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,540
Just for my I had a pretty good amount of roots, but it wasn't that much

635
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,500
It was not that much roots. I had so pissed. I just did it myself at that point

636
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:43,300
But um, I ghosted them that next appointment because I was like, oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll do it

637
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:47,860
And now every time I walk by that hair salon. I hope they don't recognize me

638
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:53,620
Three I can't play three hundred dollars for your roots that I I would stab somebody

639
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:58,900
I was I was annoyed, but I I said yes because I was like, maybe I'll go

640
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:06,180
But then I realized that that's crazy and what's the fucking point. So yeah, I never ended up falling

641
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:10,340
Thank god, screw them. Yeah, screw them screw them

642
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:18,180
I'm a family member who's a hair stylist do the Canadian hair stylist just suck. No, it's obviously the american ones too

643
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:25,220
Yeah, I don't know what it I don't know if it's just like they just don't give a shit or they're just money hungry because I

644
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:29,380
I think they make commission maybe on top of hourly depending on where they work

645
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,260
Oh, so do they try to like sell you their products?

646
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:38,420
It depends like some of the places I go to they try to upsell like shampoo and shit

647
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:45,620
So I don't know if maybe they get a percent from that. Oh, they probably do. Yeah, that would make so much sense if they got a percent from that

648
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:50,740
That's bullshit. Yeah, it's actually how it is. Oh, okay. Yeah, I guess it's true. Yeah, I don't know

649
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:53,380
And it's bullshit and it takes so long to get your license

650
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,500
So maybe that's why they're like money hungry

651
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,540
Maybe but I don't know like

652
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,540
I

653
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,780
Just just come my hair

654
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,420
Come my hair woman. Yeah

655
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:10,820
If I can do it myself this easily, you know, why can't you do it?

656
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:17,700
You're paying for this you're paying for the skill that the the years that it took to develop this skill or whatever

657
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:25,140
Didn't take me years to develop the skill. Yeah, it's I've been cutting my hair since I was a teenager screw you

658
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,180
Get on my level

659
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:36,020
As a barber, I can tell you that's exactly how they teach you to act in stores. All colors and sales are very much pushed

660
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:42,020
Even barbers, but men don't care about about their hair health or their hair color

661
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:48,100
Even a barber. I feel like it depends of depends. But I've yeah, I've never met a guy who really cares about his hair color

662
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,660
Yeah, they use like five in one shampoo. They don't yeah

663
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:57,380
Go to the hair salon and see like the fancy conditioner and they're like, oh, maybe I need to smooth their hair

664
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,660
I feel like they don't care about that

665
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:05,940
Maybe it's like a different level of care

666
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,020
Is it the beard?

667
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:12,100
It's like you want a smoother beard a lot of men care my haircut cost me 30

668
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:17,940
Well, my haircut cost me like 50 for a trim. Yeah, what the fuck that's not a lot

669
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:23,220
20 in one

670
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,620
No, it ain't

671
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,620
You

672
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:33,940
That's so gross your hair is gonna get so dry that it's gonna fall off

673
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,500
That's why it's falling off

674
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:39,460
Because you're using five in one

675
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,580
That's why it's falling off

676
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:53,220
Why yeah, why do not more men dye their hair dye your hair? I know it's fun. Maybe they're scared of it falling off

677
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:54,820
Yeah

678
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,820
Just do it. It's okay. It's fun

679
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:00,340
Have fun with it. I think they just maybe don't care that much

680
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:04,820
Maybe I don't know. I'm not a man. Me neither. Contrary to popular belief

681
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:13,700
Someone saw voice mod on my uh, pc like, uh, what's it called like my home my home page on my pc

682
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,180
They saw voice mod and they're like, she's a man

683
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:21,460
I fucking knew it. I fucking called it. She's a man

684
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,220
I

685
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:27,540
Wait, I have a question

686
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:32,660
Yeah, did people I don't I'm just gonna say this bluntly did people acknowledge that you jack off

687
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,900
Like in your streams

688
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:39,060
Like do they just sit here and they're like, yeah, I just listened to your audio and it was so great

689
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:42,020
Do they come in here and say that sometimes? Yeah, I think so

690
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:48,740
I'm but imagine you're just like I just I don't know. I've never had that happen before so I just

691
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:51,060
Is that normal?

692
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,540
I'm drugging my penis to your audio right now

693
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:59,140
Just thought you'd like to know you should see my marshmallow. They go way crazier there

694
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,180
Yeah, it's normal

695
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:07,460
They're like, hi. I mean, thank you so much for that newest twitter audio. I came to it like five times

696
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:11,140
Yeah, that's what they say and it's normal

697
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,420
You're welcome

698
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:20,420
No, it just it's just funny to me because in any other streamers chat you would get bonked so hard

699
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:24,180
I just I like that. I just I appreciate the difference like respectfully

700
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:26,420
Yeah

701
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:28,100
amazing

702
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:30,100
It's just refreshing

703
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:35,380
I guess because a lot of I mean, it's not nobody has to do something if they're not comfortable with it, but

704
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:39,300
It's nice to see people who are comfortable with it

705
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,260
Yeah

706
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:46,820
Of course. I mean, we kind of have to be comfortable with it. No, you're being forced

707
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,780
I'm here against my will

708
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:57,140
They they they stole my passport and they said if you don't join feel or we're stealing your identity and putting you in

709
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:59,460
thousands and billions of dollars and no

710
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:07,700
Yes, you're supposed to join your penis to the audios though personally whenever I listen to nsfw audios

711
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:11,380
I don't I don't jerk it. I just kind of listen to it for the artistry sometimes

712
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:15,700
That's how I feel. I don't I don't sit there. I don't jerk it. I just listen. Yeah. Yeah

713
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:19,620
That's really what I did. I would just listen like while I'm doing something

714
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:24,020
Yeah, the professional appreciation of the audio. Yeah

715
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:31,700
This is before I really knew anything about like asmr or anything. I just uh, I liked the scenarios. I was like, oh

716
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:36,260
Let me listen to it. It started early. It started on um soundcloud

717
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:40,980
I found them really soundcloud. Yeah

718
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:48,660
Did you know that there's there's asmr role play on soundcloud like x on soundcloud? I've never I did not know that

719
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,900
Yeah, I found a hope my first one was a home stuck

720
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:07,700
And I don't know much about home stuck to this day, but let me see if I can still find the first one I found

721
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:11,060
I don't know if it's still up. Is that embarrassing?

722
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,900
Is it

723
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:17,380
I mean, I don't like home stuck so to me it is

724
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,660
I don't know anything about home stuck

725
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,980
but

726
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:25,460
I thought it was fun. I heard that the fandom is crazy

727
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:30,580
It is I haven't heard much of the fandom since like the 20

728
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:36,260
pens though. Yeah, they're not it's not as popular anymore. Okay. Let me see home stuck

729
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:39,860
Ex-listener

01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:45,540
Oh god. Oh my god. Home stuck ex-listener. I don't know if they'll be okay. This must not be it

731
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:51,220
I need to know the home stuck characters. Hold on home stuck because it was a specific character

732
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,660
It was the nerdy one

733
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:01,220
I don't I don't really remember the characters either. It was kankeri

734
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:05,060
It was kankeri. It was kankeri ex-listener

735
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,020

There's genshin. Oh my god, there's not safer work stuff on soundcloud. Is that allowed?

737
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:17,460
Yes, bless you. It is allowed. Thank you.

01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,700

Really?

745
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,220
The comments are funny though

746
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:58,500
Actually, no, it's very usually it's kind of cringe. Oh, no. Yeah, the voice comments are usually kind of suck

747
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:01,300
Yeah, the comments are usually filled with kids

748
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,500
You

749
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:09,780

752
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:28,340
New grounds is the best place ever in the 2000s. What's new grounds?

753
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:31,860
It's like a it's it's like an animation website

01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:38,260
But I think they have other stuff there, too. I don't know. It's been I haven't been on that website in a long time

755
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:45,220
Is he's too young for new grounds? I think new grounds.com. I've never

756
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:51,140
It's an animation website

757
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:53,220
I think it's like

758
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:58,100
They wasn't just animations. I think they what else do they post? I don't remember they have games there, too

759
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,740

Oh, so it's not just like

765
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:19,460
Okay, I thought it was just like animation and like games, but apparently it's like a lot of stuff

766
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,540
Didn't they used to have pornography there?

767
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:27,940

01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:43,620

912
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:05,620
It was okay. Yeah, it has 20 million views. I can see why it's popular

913
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:13,700
Watch the shape shifter one. Is that one curse? I want to curse stuff. I don't want to just watch the stuff you jack off to

914
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,980
How do I know it's the shape shifter one?

915
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:24,580
I

916
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:33,860
We don't have cursed stuff watch the cursed prince. What's the none of these are titled the curse prince

917
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:45,460
I can't tell which one is the shape shifter one

918
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:47,460
And

919
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:52,420
Fander tails cursed prince

920
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,740
Fandal tails

921
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:02,980

01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:08,740
Yeah

925
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:10,740
That makes a lot of sense

926
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:18,740
Like oh fandal tails the curse prince of that. Oh, that's that's the title. Okay. Oh, wow, there's like plot

927
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:27,780
I hate plot really. I like I like a little I fucking hate it. I'm not here to listen to your life story. I'm here to goon

928
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:36,340
I like a little plot though. I feel like it makes the gooning experience better when it gets to the actual like goon part, you know

929
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:39,380
I just skip it

930
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:48,100
Yeah, I skip it. I like it. It's like a filler episode. No, it's the build up. It's the build up that looks good

931
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:50,260
Yeah

932
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:53,540
This is just one guy that animated all this. It's really well done

933
01:21:56,580 --> 01:22:02,660
Um, yeah, this is the shape shifter one is also pretty uh, I mean, I guess it has like some blood play in it

934
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:06,580
Which I guess oh show me. It's really not a lot. It just showed

935
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:09,300
I don't even know if I can find the time stamp anymore

936
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:15,300
Derpixon is a girl. Well, she's very uh talented

937
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:20,980
She is she's very talented. I hope she gets hired by like a an actual uh

938
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:27,060
Or hope she got hired by an actual uh, imagine using this as like your portfolio

939
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:31,220
That would be great. That would go hard. That would be bold

940
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:35,540
If it's really well done that really enhances the goon

941
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:40,260
The plot? Well, I guess yeah, I guess the plot. I don't know

942
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:47,300
Is that wait, did they did they also do the da da da da da da da da da na na na na?

01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:53,060
Oh, wait, no that was a different guy. I remember. Uh, I forgot his name

966
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,200
Wait, wasn't there more emo ones?

967
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,200
Or am I emo?

968
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,200
Raven?

969
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,200
Yeah.

970
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,960
I've never watched Teen Titans, I don't know.

971
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:10,480
Currently I am watching Starfire getting pinned by a tentacle monster though.

972
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,720
Oh wow.

973
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,960
You guys are crazy.

974
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:16,960
Is it any good?

975
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,960
Why do you want to know?

976
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:26,560
No, it's got like, I don't know, this is too intense for me personally.

977
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,560
Really?

978
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:32,920
Yeah, it's just a lot of tentacle stuff going on.

979
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:38,520
I'm not a fan of excessive gum, you know?

980
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:41,280
Oh yeah, that's kind of nasty.

981
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:51,160
It's too much, it starts to look like old milk, it makes me think of curdled milk.

982
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:55,200
The way they're drawing in this one especially, it just makes me think of curdled milk when

983
01:24:55,200 --> 01:25:00,320
there's a lot of it, so I don't like excessive gum.

984
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:04,400
It's disgusting.

985
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:10,400
Disgusting.

986
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,400
Hinka P.

987
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,400
Blackbird.

988
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:16,080
I'm not watching, I'm not watching any more of your recommendations for Pran.

989
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:20,120
I don't want to see any more of it.

990
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,840
You got to pay for that.

991
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,840
Yeah, wait, what?

992
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,840
What?

993
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:29,040
Pay to have me watch the recommendations, is that what you mean?

994
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,040
Yeah, why not?

995
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:34,240
It's an experience, it's a bonding experience.

996
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:37,000
I guess that could be a fun idea.

997
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Yellow gum.

998
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,400
I might just like shit on it the whole time though.

999
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,200
That's what I would do.

1000
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:49,240
Yeah, I think I might just like critique it.

1001
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,400
Yellow gum.

1002
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:55,240
It's better when it's yellow, wait, what?

1003
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,240
Side eye.

1004
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:57,240
What?

1005
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,240
Wait.

1006
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,240
Does it get yellow somehow?

1007
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,240
Are you talking about, are you talking about?

1008
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,240
Maybe with an infection.

1009
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:04,240
What?

1010
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:08,240
Why would you want it to be, if it's mixed with pee?

1011
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:14,320
What do you guys mean when it's yellow, what does that mean?

1012
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:18,400
That is disease, does it get yellow sometimes?

1013
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,740
It gets yellow when it's old.

1014
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:25,240
Like when it dries?

1015
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:32,240
If it's, yellow one tastes better.

1016
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:42,240
Oh, that just reminds me of like curdled milk.

1017
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:45,600
Like really old, if you eat a bunch of beetroot it can be pink.

1018
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,600
That's cute.

1019
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:47,600
That is kinda cute.

1020
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:48,600
If I was a guy who specifically eat love.

1021
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,600
That's really pop.

1022
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,600
Yeah, that's really pop.

1023
01:26:50,600 --> 01:27:00,040
If I was a guy who specifically eat a lot of beetroot so it can be pink, so my gun

1024
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,040
can be pink and sparkly.

1025
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,040
That would be so cute.

1026
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:03,040
It would be so cute.

1027
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,040
I can't do it right now though.

1028
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:05,040
I'll just get an infection.

1029
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,040
Eat pineapple.

1030
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:07,040
I don't like pineapples gross.

1031
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,040
What?

1032
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:09,040
I love pineapples.

1033
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:16,040
I'm not a fan.

1034
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:25,920
You're not a fan of pineapple.

1035
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:26,920
Why?

1036
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:29,240
Well, first of all it eats you alive.

1037
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:30,240
It burns you.

1038
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,520
It's just a little bit acidic.

1039
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:36,640
Do you like octopus?

1040
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:38,640
What?

1041
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:41,140
It's okay, and not really.

1042
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:44,340
Okay, I don't know, I was gonna say octopus would probably-

1043
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:45,940
Yeah, what was your point?

1044
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:49,640
Well, don't you know, like, people like to eat live octopus, too.

1045
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:53,140
Oh, yeah, I don't think I could. That would feel so slime.

1046
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:56,340
What if their suckers get stuck in your throat and you choke on it and die?

1047
01:27:56,340 --> 01:27:57,740
Yeah, that happens.

1048
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:00,240
It does happen.

1049
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:03,040
Dr. Pepper withdraws. I'm surviving.

1050
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:06,940
Oh, yeah, you said you're only doing one Dr. Pepper day instead of, like, three?

1051
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:08,240
Yeah.

1052
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:08,740
How's it going?

1053
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:09,740
Empty calories.

1054
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:12,340
I haven't had one in 24 hours.

1055
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:15,140
Are you going through withdrawals?

1056
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:17,140
Yes, I'm tweaking.

1057
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,340
You're feeling okay?

1058
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,540
Do you need to go get a Dr. Pepper?

1059
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,340
No, it's okay. I've been drinking so much water.

1060
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:29,340
It curbs my craving.

1061
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:32,340
I was so proud of you for drinking water.

1062
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:35,940
You better- you might want to stop doing that.

1063
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:39,840
Because I'm weak to that.

1064
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:41,340
Weak to what?

1065
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:43,640
Praise.

1066
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:45,540
Weak to praise?

1067
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:46,640
Yes.

1068
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:48,740
We're drinking water.

1069
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:52,140
Yes, I was starved of attention as a child.

1070
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:59,340
Well, then I'll keep praising you. You're doing- you're doing amazing.

1071
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:03,540
Thank you.

1072
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:09,840
Oh.

1073
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,940
Why do you like Dr. Pepper more than the other ones?

1074
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:19,040
I went through a Dr. Pepper phase, too.

1075
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,040
Because it tastes superior.

1076
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:23,140
Really?

1077
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,640
Yeah, I don't like- Coke is okay.

1078
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:29,340
Pepsi is too sweet. Dr. Pepper feels just right.

1079
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,440
Tell them also she's a good girl.

1080
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,340
Hahaha.

1081
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:38,340
Would you like that?

1082
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:42,340
No.

1083
01:29:45,740 --> 01:29:47,340
Okay, I won't then.

1084
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:49,340
I won't.

1085
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,440
I'm sorry, I meant to say yes, sorry.

1086
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:56,740
Yeah, you're giving me mixed- you're giving me mixed answers here.

1087
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,640
Sorry, I have problems.

1088
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:03,940
I feel like it should be the other way around.

1089
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:06,140
What do you mean by that?

1090
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:11,440
Like, you're the one with like the more mother model.

1091
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,740
Yeah, does she know?

1092
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:17,440
No, she knows, she knows, she knows.

1093
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:18,340
She does not know.

1094
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:22,440
But didn't you choose- didn't you say you specifically asked to have boobs with this model?

1095
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:29,040
Yeah, so my PL- my PL is a loli and I was like, I'm tired of not having boobs.

1096
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:32,940
So I wanted boobs and I asked for boobs and they gave me boobs, so now I have boobs.

1097
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:35,340
Congratulations.

1098
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:36,340
Thank you.

1099
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:42,440
I just- yeah, okay, that's good that you got what you wanted though.

1100
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:47,140
Yeah, because I mean the- like the- what's it called?

1101
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:53,640
The flat- like the cutting board jokes kind of get old because I streamed for so long as a loli and I was like,

1102
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:55,340
I've heard these jokes for four years now.

1103
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:56,740
Can we- can we get over with?

1104
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:59,340
Mmm, okay.

1105
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:02,940
I- I never really got many cutting board jokes.

1106
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:08,040
I used to get them- no, I never got really many cutting board jokes.

1107
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:16,240
No, no, but I streamed more as- I think I might have streamed just as long as like a real life person.

1108
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:22,140
So I think they weren't exactly allowed to make cutting board jokes with me.

1109
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:23,540
Uh, okay.

1110
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,340
We appreciate flat here.

1111
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:30,640
Yes, of course we do.

1112
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:33,440
Of course we do.

1113
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:40,940
Minecraft super- super flat world, ah.

1114
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,540
I mean your dress is green.

1115
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:50,040
It is, and my buttons are brown. I'm basically Minecraft themed.

1116
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:51,140
You are.

1117
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:53,840
I should put a block on your head.

1118
01:31:57,740 --> 01:31:58,840
Uh-uh-uh.

1119
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:01,040
Here you go.

1120
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,940
I want to- I want to stick to your head.

1121
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:05,940
Oh my god!

1122
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:07,940
Is it sticking?

1123
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:11,840
It's like stuck- it's stuck behind your head on my screen- oh whatever, we'll put it behind your head.

1124
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,940
How did you put that there?

1125
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:17,940
I- I have no clue why it's behind your head, but it's just there.

1126
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:19,840
It's in front of my head for me.

1127
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:20,740
Really?

1128
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:21,740
Yeah!

1129
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:23,540
Shit, if it works and it works.

1130
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:24,840
Move me!

1131
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:26,340
You can move me over.

1132
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:27,840
Which direction? Left or right?

1133
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:31,840
Whatever direction you want, so you can find the Minecraft block.

1134
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:34,940
Why won't- I won't go on top.

1135
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:36,940
Maybe I have to change like the layer order.

1136
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:41,140
Minecraft block.

1137
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,340
Minecraft block.

1138
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:48,840
I don't know- I don't know why I won't go on your head.

1139
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:52,340
Why are you waving it around?

1140
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,540
You're blocking me with it.

1141
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:56,740
I'm trying to- I'm trying to stick it to your head.

1142
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:01,540
Oh yeah, it's on your stream, it's going behind my head, but on my stream, it's in front of me.

1143
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:09,640
How do I-

1144
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:13,340
I can't control the block at all, I don't think.

1145
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:14,940
It's there.

1146
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:17,040
The software hates us.

1147
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:18,140
Yeah.

1148
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:19,140
Ahem.

1149
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:27,340
Mmm, what were your- what were your favorite games as a kid? Like video games?

1150
01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:29,940
Team Fortress 2?

1151
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:36,140
That's all. I played like Left 4 Dead 2 and Team Fortress 2 exclusively, pretty much.

1152
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:37,140
And Toontown.

1153
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:42,540
I don't even know what Team Fortress 2 is.

1154
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:45,740
We're gonna have to put you in the game right now.

1155
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:49,540
Team Fortress 2. Is it like a shooter game?

1156
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:50,840
Yeah.

1157
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:57,040
Oh, this looks like- I think I'm gonna offend people if I say that.

1158
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:59,040
My guard is on high.

1159
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,540
Isn't this wasskibbity twi-

1160
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,840
This looks like the skibbity twi-

1161
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:13,540
I'm flabbergasted.

1162
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,040
Is this not it?

1163
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:16,540
It's-

1164
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:20,340
Kind of, but like not really.

1165
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:28,540
Like they all- I think they all share the same engine and therefore they share the same assets, but it's not from TF2.

1166
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:31,340
I think it's Gmod or Half-Life, yeah.

1167
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:32,040
Wait.

1168
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:34,940
Gmod?

1169
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:39,440
Gmod looks different.

1170
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,940
Wait, Gmod also has similar characters.

1171
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:44,640
Yeah, they're all made by Valob.

1172
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:47,040
Oh, is that why they look so similar?

1173
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:49,540
I guess so, yeah.

1174
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:53,340
They used to share assets between the games, I guess, to save money.

1175
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:55,440
Oh, oh.

1176
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:57,740
Would they share character models too?

1177
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:00,140
Cause that's what it looks like.

1178
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:03,340
I don't know how the games work.

1179
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:04,940
It's less that they share them.

1180
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:08,640
I think it's just because they have the same engine and same assets.

1181
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:09,140
I don't know.

1182
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:11,740
It's kind of complicated now that I think about it.

1183
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:14,240
Skibiti was made in Gmod.

1184
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:15,240
Oh, okay.

1185
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:15,940
It's the source.

1186
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:17,540
Skibiti dub dub dub.

1187
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:23,240
Gmod has Half-Life models and everything.

1188
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:26,040
No way she doesn't know what Gmod is.

1189
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:26,840
Let me please-

1190
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:27,940
I was never a gamer.

1191
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:31,040
It's more the fact that I'm not a gamer than being a swimmer.

1192
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:31,840
That's fair.

1193
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:34,440
Yeah, like my favorite games as a kid were like-

1194
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:40,340
Okay, when I was older, it was a furry role-playing game.

1195
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:43,340
When I was younger, it was like-

1196
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:48,340
I didn't really play many games other than-

1197
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:50,840
I played like Mario Kart on the DS and stuff.

1198
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:55,340
Like Super Mario Bros on the DS.

1199
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:58,340
I never got a DS.

1200
01:35:58,840 --> 01:35:59,840
No?

1201
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:01,840
No, I didn't.

1202
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:02,840
No?

1203
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:05,940
No, I wasn't raised with-

1204
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:07,840
My parents didn't allow me to have consoles.

1205
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:09,740
Oh, why not?

1206
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,740
Because they didn't believe in them.

1207
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:14,240
What is that?

1208
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,640
Were you not allowed to watch TV either or something?

1209
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,140
I wasn't-

1210
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:18,140
No, it's so weird.

1211
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:20,640
I don't understand because I would ask like-

1212
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:24,640
Mom, I went to PlayStation for Christmas and they'd always say no.

1213
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:29,840
But they gave me pretty much free access on the internet.

1214
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:31,740
So I don't really know.

1215
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:34,940
But I wasn't allowed to watch or read Harry Potter.

1216
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:36,440
Why?

1217
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:38,740
DEMONIC.

1218
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:41,140
It was demonic?

1219
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:42,840
To my parents, yeah.

1220
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:46,040
I don't think it's actually demonic.

1221
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,040
I think they're crazy.

1222
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:49,740
Oh, no, yeah, they're definitely-

1223
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:53,640
Yeah, my parents are very, very, very religious.

1224
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:55,740
Oh, that makes sense.

1225
01:36:55,740 --> 01:36:56,840
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1226
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:59,240
I'm putting my phone on the charger, sorry.

1227
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:00,340
It's okay, it's okay.

1228
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:02,340
You're clicking around.

1229
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:06,040
Yeah.

1230
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:10,340
When I played Toontown, I always played a cat.

1231
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:12,340
Because I'm original.

1232
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:15,140
I don't even know what Toontown is.

1233
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:19,840
Oh.

1234
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:23,340
I've never played this either.

1235
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,340
Is it like Disney?

1236
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:29,140
It was Disney, then they shut it down and then they have like

1237
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:31,540
a community-run version of it now.

1238
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,340
And it's not Disney anymore?

1239
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:37,140
Not Disney, just random people running it, I guess.

1240
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:42,140
Why do Christian parents dislike specifically Harry Potter?

1241
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:43,640
I don't know.

1242
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:46,040
I think it's because they equate it to witchcraft.

1243
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:49,940
And witchcraft is bad for them.

1244
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:51,540
Yeah.

1245
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:53,240
Satanic or something.

1246
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:54,940
Pretty much, yeah.

1247
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:56,840
The witches.

1248
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:58,440
The witches.

1249
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:00,940
The witches and wizards.

1250
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:04,040
Yeah, Satanic Panic was a very real thing.

1251
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:07,240
My parents, my dad will be 70 next month, so.

1252
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:08,740
Oh, that's old.

1253
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:09,940
Yeah.

1254
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:14,240
I think maybe there's a little bit of the that remaining in him.

1255
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:16,440
Satanic Panic?

1256
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:21,340
Yeah, they were terrified of Satan.

1257
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,140
It was like fear mongering, I think.

1258
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:31,340
A moral panic consisting of over 12,000 cases of Satanic ritual abuse.

1259
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,640
Unsubstantiated cases.

1260
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:38,840
So wait, people were like scared of Satanists at the time?

1261
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:44,440
Because there were allegations of Satanists.

1262
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:48,240
Abusing people?

1263
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:49,040
Something like that.

1264
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:50,440
Is that it?

1265
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:53,840
I've heard that like the Satanic ritual abuse.

1266
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:57,340
I heard that some people are playing it up to feed into their own agenda,

1267
01:38:57,340 --> 01:39:00,240
but I have no, I don't really read too much on that sort of thing.

1268
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:03,540
That's funny.

1269
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,140
That's like cartoon level.

1270
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:07,340
Like, ooh, it's the Satanists that did it.

1271
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:08,840
It's the witches.

1272
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:10,340
It's the witches.

1273
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:11,840
Burn them at the stake.

1274
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:15,440
DnD is Satanic.

1275
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:16,840
Oh yeah, like stranger things.

1276
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:21,140
Wait, they thought DnD was Satanic?

1277
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:22,840
Isn't that just a role-playing game?

1278
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,840
That's like ultimate evil stuff.

1279
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:32,640
It's nerd stuff and people, I guess because there's like all sorts of different kind of like stuff in there

1280
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:34,040
that could be seen as demonic.

1281
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:36,640
Religious people did not like that, I guess maybe.

1282
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:38,640
That's crazy.

1283
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:43,140
Witches and wizards and demons and succubus and incubus.

1284
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:51,640
They were scared of content and activities.

1285
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:54,140
Some churches burning in Europe didn't help.

1286
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:58,140
That's crazy stuff, dude.

1287
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:00,140
They keep up with each other too much.

1288
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:02,640
Mind your beeswax.

1289
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:10,640
Role-playing was like being possessed by a demon friend.

1290
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,640
I was possessed by a furry demon then.

1291
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:22,840
Wait, I went through a phase where I was a furry and then somebody tried to groom me and I stopped being a furry.

1292
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:25,840
How were you a furry?

1293
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:31,140
Back in the day when I was in middle school I used to, I got into drawing furry art

1294
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:35,840
and then a 30 year old man approached me and he was like hi and I was like oh hi

1295
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:39,240
and then he tried to groom me and I was like no thank you and I left.

1296
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:43,440
Did this really happen?

1297
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:45,940
Yes, I can send you my DeviantArt.

1298
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:49,140
Oh, you were posting it on DeviantArt.

1299
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:50,740
Yeah, let me grab it.

1300
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:56,140
Don't tell anybody, this is like my deepest darkest secret.

1301
01:40:56,240 --> 01:41:00,140
I never posted my furry stuff on DeviantArt.

1302
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:04,140
I just had it in my art book, that's all.

1303
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:08,440
I sent it to like my one friend who could have been a 30 year old man.

1304
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:09,140
I don't know.

1305
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:09,740
Oh.

1306
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:17,540
He sent me because the reason why I think he was catfishing or they were catfishing is because we were both the same age

1307
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:23,840
and she was like oh we should send selfies to each other and I sent her like a really shitty selfie because I was like a fucking kid.

1308
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:34,540
And she sent me like the prettiest like fucking Myspace level like emo girl cute selfie and I was like oh my god you're so much prettier than me.

1309
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:36,540
But now that I look back on it I'm like

1310
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:37,840
That's sus.

1311
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,940
Maybe that's a little sus.

1312
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:40,740
Yeah.

1313
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:42,440
Oh my god, your art was so cute.

1314
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:43,740
I drew like the same stuff.

1315
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:44,340
Thank you.

1316
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:48,340
I drew like the same stuff.

1317
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:50,640
Oh my god, skittles.

1318
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:53,140
Oh, it's so cute.

1319
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:54,140
Thank you.

1320
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:54,640
It's so cute.

1321
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,140
I love it so much.

1322
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:58,140
Here, let me send you some of my furry art.

1323
01:41:58,340 --> 01:41:59,240
I don't have it.

1324
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:00,140
Yay.

1325
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:04,940
I don't have a DeviantArt for it, but I'll just send you like pictures.

1326
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:08,640
It's like the same sexy.

1327
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:13,840
Oh shit, I can't on this computer profile.

1328
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:14,540
Nevermind.

1329
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:16,440
Nevermind, I don't have it.

1330
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:17,340
It's a sad day.

1331
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,240
It's a sad, sad day.

1332
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:22,640
Sounds like a fed.

1333
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:26,440
They thought I was a 30 year old man.

1334
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:30,240
They're trying to bait you out.

1335
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:34,040
Yeah, I mean, oh wait, maybe, oh no, I don't have it on this.

1336
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:34,640
Or do I?

1337
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:37,040
I'll put a file.

1338
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:49,240
Dang it.

1339
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:58,740
I'm just, I keep getting met with the same picture of that flip-flop every time I look through my camera.

1340
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:00,540
Ew.

1341
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:03,540
It is, you know?

1342
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:05,140
Yeah, I'll stop looking.

1343
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:07,240
Chunky.

1344
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:08,640
Chunky.

1345
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:11,540
I've never had any of those that chunky.

1346
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:15,340
Just a little bit of chunk mostly.

1347
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:18,040
Yeah, I've had some pretty large chunks.

1348
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:22,040
I don't like the feeling of the chunks.

1349
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:25,840
I feel like I can feel it like warp out, like, like, like.

1350
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:29,640
You did not just make that sound.

1351
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:32,940
That was the sound of this with the corpse out of your pooch.

1352
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:34,240
No, it's true.

1353
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:38,040
It goes like, it's so aggressive.

1354
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:43,640
And it hurts and you can feel it coming between your, your lips at her.

1355
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:45,540
It's like you giving birth.

1356
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:49,440
That was literally.

1357
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:53,140
But like the thing that sucks about pads is like, I don't know.

1358
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:57,040
I know you don't wear them, but like getting your hair stuck in the glue is so painful.

1359
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:00,640
It is, that's why I don't wear them.

1360
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:01,740
It's coming out.

1361
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:08,340
Get your hair stuck in the glue.

1362
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:16,140
And also, like, when you have a big, a big glue or piece like that, it like doesn't suck it up.

1363
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:18,740
It doesn't suck it up at all.

1364
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:22,840
It just sits on the pad and then it's wet and then you sit in it.

1365
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:27,840
And then your whole, then your whole Gucci's like covered in blood at that point.

1366
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,740
It's really gross.

1367
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:32,740
It is gross.

1368
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,540
And sometimes it gets stuck in your hair.

1369
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:40,340
And then you have to rip the clot out of your hair.

1370
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:41,340
It's so painful.

1371
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:56,140
Did you know, did you know that they didn't start testing pads on real period blood until recently?

1372
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:58,140
I did not know that.

1373
01:44:58,240 --> 01:44:59,040
Why?

1374
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:00,440
I don't know.

1375
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:02,340
Let me just hear a blood.

1376
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:07,840
Let me just make sure that I'm not lying, spreading in lies on the internet right now.

1377
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,040
Misinformation.

1378
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:13,740
Bless you.

1379
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:15,240
Thank you.

1380
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:23,440
From 2023, no one studied menstrual product observancy realistically up until now.

1381
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:40,440
So they did a study and found that many menstrual products had a much lower or higher liquid

1382
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:44,840
capacity than advertised when real blood was used instead of saline.

1383
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:46,540
They used saline.

1384
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:47,940
Salt water.

1385
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:49,740
Yeah, I guess so.

1386
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:52,340
That is not the same thing at all.

1387
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:53,340
That is not the same.

1388
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:55,640
Make sure of water, salt and bicarbonate.

1389
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:57,540
That is not the same thing at all.

1390
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:00,440
Yeah, people don't lie on the internet.

1391
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:03,740
I lie on the internet.

1392
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:05,040
No, you don't.

1393
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:06,340
You always tell the truth.

1394
01:46:07,140 --> 01:46:08,940
I always tell the truth on the internet.

1395
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:10,040
Exactly.

1396
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:12,040
Pads were used as medical gods for bullet wounds.

1397
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:13,840
Nurses just said, Hey, this is useful.

1398
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,140
Good for the nurses.

1399
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:16,440
Nurses saved us.

1400
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:21,640
It's the same reason that you went.

1401
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:26,340
I heard you could use like a tampon and shove it in like a really deep wound if you have to.

1402
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,140
I've never done that before though.

1403
01:46:30,740 --> 01:46:32,240
I've never done that either.

1404
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:33,240
But thank you for the tip.

1405
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:35,440
I'll keep that in mind in case I get a bullet wound.

1406
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:37,340
You're welcome.

1407
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:40,040
Thank you.

1408
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:45,340
Well, do you ever want to have kids or you said no, right?

1409
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:48,240
I kind of can't.

1410
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:50,340
Yeah, you said you can't, right?

1411
01:46:50,740 --> 01:46:52,440
Yeah, maybe, I don't know.

1412
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:56,440
I feel like I'm too young for me to sit here and be like, yeah, cause once you have kids,

1413
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:57,940
you can never turn back, you know?

1414
01:46:57,940 --> 01:46:58,440
Yeah, sure.

1415
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:01,140
Well, you can put them up for adoption, but then like,

1416
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:01,840
That's true.

1417
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:02,840
Then you feel bad.

1418
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:04,040
Yeah, then you feel bad.

1419
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:07,740
It's like adopting a pet and then returning it like you feel bad.

1420
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:08,440
That's bad.

1421
01:47:08,540 --> 01:47:09,540
You shouldn't do that.

1422
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:10,740
Yeah.

1423
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:17,640
Yeah, cause I, this, all this period talk reminded me of like the girl with the list on TikTok who like

1424
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:23,840
made a whole list of everything that can go wrong if you get pregnant and it's like your teeth will fall out.

1425
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:31,640
Your, your feet will swell, your fucking kids will smear poop on your walls or they'll just poop inside of you.

1426
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:33,340
That's true.

1427
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:37,840
Yeah, they'll poop inside of you or like, I don't know, try to think of all the other ones.

1428
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:41,640
Like you can get allergic to water or something or you can get allergic to your own sweat.

1429
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:42,840
Oh yeah, you can, you get new allergies.

1430
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:43,340
Yeah.

1431
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:46,940
And then your fucking armpits will start to lactate or something.

1432
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:51,840
That is a new sentence.

1433
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:58,240
I heard of that where like, like the, the milk starts to get stored in your armpits too.

1434
01:47:59,740 --> 01:48:00,240
Yeah.

1435
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:03,240
Oh wait, I want to, wait, I want to clarify something.

1436
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:10,040
I have endometriosis and it's, it's hard to have kids when you have endo.

1437
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:10,840
Yeah.

1438
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:19,740
So even if I had like a surrogate, I mean, I don't know the science of this, but I don't know if it would even survive.

1439
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:27,740
A surrogate, do you mean like you'd put your own egg in someone else and another lady's body?

1440
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:31,740
Oh, I thought, I thought you mean like somebody like puts their sperm in my, in my coochie.

1441
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:34,740
I thought you meant, sorry, I was thinking the wrong way.

1442
01:48:34,740 --> 01:48:35,740
That's not a surrogate.

1443
01:48:35,740 --> 01:48:36,740
That's not a surrogate.

1444
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:38,740
But I thought, but like a sperm donor.

1445
01:48:38,740 --> 01:48:40,740
Yeah, that's a sperm donor.

1446
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:42,740
A surrogate is for the mom.

1447
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:44,740
Oh, they're different.

1448
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:46,740
Yeah, surrogacy is for the mother.

1449
01:48:46,740 --> 01:48:47,740
Yeah.

1450
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:51,740
So if I, I take my, wait, how does that work?

1451
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:55,740
So I take my egg and put someone's nut in her womb?

1452
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:56,740
Yeah, you can put both.

1453
01:48:56,740 --> 01:48:59,740
You can put your egg in someone else's nut in her womb.

1454
01:48:59,740 --> 01:49:00,740
Yeah.

1455
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:02,740
Oh, I don't know how I feel about that.

1456
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:05,740
And yeah, it's kind of fucked up because you're just using her for her.

1457
01:49:05,740 --> 01:49:06,740
Yeah.

1458
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:08,740
And then it costs a lot of money.

1459
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:15,740
And like you, I kind of, if I, if I were going to be a mom, I'd kind of want my own, like my own experience, no offense.

1460
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:19,740
I would not want my own experience at all.

1461
01:49:19,740 --> 01:49:20,740
Absolutely not.

1462
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:23,740
I'm terrified running the oven.

1463
01:49:26,740 --> 01:49:30,740
Yeah. Cause it's like part of pregnancy is the trauma.

1464
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:32,740
Oh, you want to live through it?

1465
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:33,740
Yeah.

1466
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:35,740
But like, aren't you scared?

1467
01:49:35,740 --> 01:49:39,740
Like, you know, your, your, your fault, your fucking cervix can fall out.

1468
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:41,740
Like your womb can fall out afterwards.

1469
01:49:41,740 --> 01:49:42,740
Yeah.

1470
01:49:42,740 --> 01:49:43,740
Your butthole can fall out.

1471
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:45,740
Your butthole can fall out too.

1472
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:47,740
That too.

1473
01:49:47,740 --> 01:49:48,740
I don't know.

1474
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:51,740
Like you want, you want, you're okay with that?

1475
01:49:51,740 --> 01:49:54,740
I want to be a victim.

1476
01:49:54,740 --> 01:49:56,740
You're already a victim.

1477
01:49:56,740 --> 01:50:01,740
But like, you know, like how you look at a big old pregnant bitch and she can barely work.

1478
01:50:01,740 --> 01:50:03,740
And you're like, wow, I feel bad for her.

1479
01:50:03,740 --> 01:50:06,740
I want people to feel that way about me.

1480
01:50:06,740 --> 01:50:08,740
Damn, she's a big old pregnant bitch.

1481
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:09,740
She can't work.

1482
01:50:09,740 --> 01:50:12,740
I want people to like wait on my, my every need, you know?

1483
01:50:12,740 --> 01:50:13,740
Oh, you.

1484
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:16,740
So you just want people to like help you with stuff.

1485
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:17,740
Yeah.

1486
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:19,740
I'm a fat ass pregnant bitch.

1487
01:50:19,740 --> 01:50:21,740
Do you work for me?

1488
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:25,740
That's probably shallow.

1489
01:50:25,740 --> 01:50:26,740
Just how you're made.

1490
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:31,740
You know, a lot of pregnant women don't even get work done for them either too.

1491
01:50:31,740 --> 01:50:33,740
But I don't want to pay anybody.

1492
01:50:33,740 --> 01:50:34,740
I want it to be free.

1493
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:36,740
I want people to pity me.

1494
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:39,740
I don't think people will pity you just because you're pregnant.

1495
01:50:39,740 --> 01:50:40,740
Really?

1496
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:43,740
You don't, you don't look at a big old pregnant woman in Walmart and she's like trying to bend over

1497
01:50:43,740 --> 01:50:44,740
because she dropped her phone.

1498
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:46,740
You don't feel bad for her.

1499
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:48,740
I feel kind of bad.

1500
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:49,740
Okay.

1501
01:50:49,740 --> 01:50:51,740
But do you go and help her?

1502
01:50:51,740 --> 01:50:52,740
No.

1503
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:59,740
I just sit there and stare and watch her fight for her life.

1504
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:01,740
That's what I'm saying.

1505
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:02,740
Okay.

1506
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:03,740
Okay.

1507
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:04,740
You have a point.

1508
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:05,740
You have a point.

1509
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:06,740
Okay.

1510
01:51:06,740 --> 01:51:11,740
That's like what I see is somebody who falls and they're just laying on the floor.

1511
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:12,740
I just stare.

1512
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:14,740
That's what I'm saying.

1513
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:17,740
You don't go and help her.

1514
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:18,740
Okay.

1515
01:51:18,740 --> 01:51:19,740
Okay.

1516
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:20,740
You have a point.

1517
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:21,740
I have been corrected.

1518
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:22,740
You just want to be pampered, right?

1519
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:23,740
That's the thing.

1520
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:24,740
Yeah.

1521
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:25,740
Yeah.

1522
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:28,740
Don't get pregnant just to get pampered.

1523
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:31,740
It's not going to happen.

1524
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:37,740
But then I get like people give me extra food because they see I'm like fat and hungry because

1525
01:51:37,740 --> 01:51:42,740
I'm eating for two.

1526
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:45,740
Well, I don't know.

1527
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:48,740
You can, you can, there's other ways to get pampered.

1528
01:51:48,740 --> 01:51:51,740
It doesn't have to be through pregnancy.

1529
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:53,740
I don't know.

1530
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:55,740
Become paralyzed.

1531
01:51:55,740 --> 01:51:59,740
Become a vegetable and then you'll have people do everything for you.

1532
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:00,740
That's a good point.

1533
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:01,740
Yeah.

1534
01:52:01,740 --> 01:52:06,740
I'm going to sever my spinal cord.

1535
01:52:06,740 --> 01:52:07,740
Okay.

1536
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:10,740
Good luck.

1537
01:52:10,740 --> 01:52:12,740
Don't die.

1538
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:14,740
I probably will, but it's okay.

1539
01:52:14,740 --> 01:52:16,740
Oh, a sugar daddy.

1540
01:52:16,740 --> 01:52:17,740
Do you want a sugar daddy?

1541
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:19,740
Is that what you want?

1542
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:21,740
I'll take a sugar anything.

1543
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:23,740
A sugar anything.

1544
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:26,740
A sugar grandma.

1545
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:29,740
As she has the money, I'll do anything.

1546
01:52:30,740 --> 01:52:32,740
That hold on.

1547
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:33,740
Hold on.

1548
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:35,740
Why are they talking about nugget?

1549
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:36,740
Become a nugget.

1550
01:52:36,740 --> 01:52:38,740
Oh, that's why.

1551
01:52:38,740 --> 01:52:39,740
Okay.

1552
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:41,740
Is that like a slur for a vegetable?

1553
01:52:41,740 --> 01:52:46,740
You don't know when it's like nugget prawn.

1554
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:48,740
Like, you don't know nugget?

1555
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:49,740
Like the tag?

1556
01:52:49,740 --> 01:52:50,740
No.

1557
01:52:50,740 --> 01:52:52,740
Wait, wait, wait, wait, something.

1558
01:52:52,740 --> 01:52:54,740
It's coming back to me.

1559
01:52:54,740 --> 01:52:56,740
Wait, is that like amputee shit?

1560
01:52:56,740 --> 01:52:58,740
Yeah, but like amputee everything.

1561
01:52:58,740 --> 01:53:00,740
Like no limbs at all.

1562
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:01,740
I like that.

1563
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:05,740
I'm just kidding.

1564
01:53:05,740 --> 01:53:07,740
I'm just kidding.

1565
01:53:09,740 --> 01:53:12,740
Sometimes I look at that and I'm like, oh,

1566
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:15,740
well, at least I could get somebody to feed me.

1567
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:20,740
I kind of understand.

1568
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:23,740
See, that's also the, the, um,

1569
01:53:23,740 --> 01:53:25,740
that's the appeal for me too,

1570
01:53:25,740 --> 01:53:27,740
because people make fun of me for being into nugget.

1571
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:30,740
I'm not actually into it, but we joke about it.

1572
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:33,740
And I get, that's the appeal for me too.

1573
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:36,740
Like, yeah, someone will feed me and like take care of me

1574
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:37,740
and do everything for me.

1575
01:53:37,740 --> 01:53:39,740
Yeah, I'll be your little nugget pet.

1576
01:53:41,740 --> 01:53:42,740
I can't run away.

1577
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:46,740
That's what I'm saying.

1578
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:48,740
That's appealing.

1579
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:50,740
It is.

1580
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:51,740
It really is.

1581
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:53,740
It's like the thought of it.

1582
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:54,740
Yeah.

1583
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:57,740
The thought of it is, the thought of it is appealing.

1584
01:54:01,740 --> 01:54:03,740
Then she judges us for knowing Derpixon.

1585
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:05,740
I didn't judge you for knowing Derpixon.

1586
01:54:05,740 --> 01:54:07,740
I'm just saying this is like Derpixon was very,

1587
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:10,740
uh, what's it called, but, uh,

1588
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:14,740
basic.

1589
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:15,740
It was like, you know,

1590
01:54:15,740 --> 01:54:16,740
Yeah, it's very vanilla.

1591
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:17,740
Yeah.

1592
01:54:17,740 --> 01:54:18,740
Very average, uh,

1593
01:54:19,740 --> 01:54:22,740
just take the pillow princess title instead.

1594
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:25,740
But like pillow princess, except in every, um,

1595
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:29,740
in every situation in life ever, do everything.

1596
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:31,740
That's how I want to be.

1597
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:32,740
Yeah.

1598
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:33,740
Me too.

1599
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:34,740
Just do everything for me.

1600
01:54:35,740 --> 01:54:40,740
Passenger princess, pillow princess, life princess.

1601
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:41,740
Just do everything.

1602
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:44,740
That's just rot maxing.

1603
01:54:44,740 --> 01:54:46,740
Your mom is rot maxing.

1604
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:50,740
I already do rot max except I don't have anyone to take care of me

1605
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:51,740
while I'm rotting.

1606
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:52,740
Me too.

1607
01:54:52,740 --> 01:54:53,740
Same, same, same.

1608
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:57,740
You said he's someone to, to help me rot.

1609
01:54:58,740 --> 01:55:00,740
Move me from the bed to the couch

1610
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:04,740
so I can rot while watching TV or something.

1611
01:55:04,740 --> 01:55:06,740
And your skin can melt into the couch.

1612
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:08,740
Oh my God, do you know that case?

1613
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:09,740
Wait, did we talk about that?

1614
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:10,740
You told me about it.

1615
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:11,740
Yeah, we did.

1616
01:55:11,740 --> 01:55:12,740
We talked about that.

1617
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:13,740
I remember now.

1618
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:14,740
I saw the pictures.

1619
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:16,740
Yeah, I remember now.

1620
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:18,740
Yeah, you can melt into the couch.

1621
01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:19,740
Jerky.

1622
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:21,740
Except they didn't take care of her,

1623
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:22,740
so that's why she rotted into the couch.

1624
01:55:22,740 --> 01:55:23,740
No.

1625
01:55:23,740 --> 01:55:24,740
Yeah.

1626
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:25,740
That's a skill issue.

1627
01:55:25,740 --> 01:55:28,740
For the parents, like, yes.

1628
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:31,740
No, I mean, I mean, like the skin being melted into the couch.

1629
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:33,740
Oh, that wouldn't happen to you?

1630
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:34,740
That wouldn't happen to me.

1631
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:36,740
I'm so, I'm so hydrated.

1632
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:39,740
My skin would not fall off and melt into a couch.

1633
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:42,740
But the point was that she couldn't hydrate herself.

1634
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:44,740
Oh.

1635
01:55:45,740 --> 01:55:47,740
I thought she was just tired.

1636
01:55:47,740 --> 01:55:48,740
No.

1637
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:50,740
That was not what happened.

1638
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:51,740
Oh.

1639
01:55:51,740 --> 01:55:53,740
Okay, I think I'm missing some context.

1640
01:55:53,740 --> 01:55:54,740
Yeah, you're missing some context.

1641
01:55:54,740 --> 01:55:56,740
I'm going to chew your food and baby bird you.

1642
01:55:56,740 --> 01:55:58,740
See, that's disgusting.

1643
01:55:58,740 --> 01:56:02,740
But like, I don't know.

1644
01:56:02,740 --> 01:56:04,740
What are your thoughts?

1645
01:56:04,740 --> 01:56:08,740
Um, baby, baby mama for the food.

1646
01:56:08,740 --> 01:56:10,740
That's disgusting.

1647
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:12,740
You're going to get a disease.

1648
01:56:12,740 --> 01:56:15,740
No, but it is a little.

1649
01:56:15,740 --> 01:56:17,740
See, the problem is if someone like,

1650
01:56:17,740 --> 01:56:19,740
words it well enough for me,

1651
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:21,740
I end up like thinking, you know what,

1652
01:56:21,740 --> 01:56:23,740
maybe it's not that bad.

1653
01:56:23,740 --> 01:56:25,740
Like spitting in the mouth?

1654
01:56:25,740 --> 01:56:28,740
Yeah, like it's just one step above that.

1655
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:30,740
Okay, that's true.

1656
01:56:30,740 --> 01:56:31,740
Yeah.

1657
01:56:31,740 --> 01:56:35,740
Are you into getting your mouth sped in?

1658
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:36,740
Sure, why not?

1659
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,740
Yeah, exactly.

1660
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:42,740
You don't have to chew.

1661
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:44,740
You could just swallow.

1662
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:47,740
Yeah, just disgusting.

1663
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:52,740
What if they want to snowball you?

1664
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:55,740
I need to, I feel like I don't quite understand

1665
01:56:55,740 --> 01:56:57,740
the meaning of snowball.

1666
01:56:57,740 --> 01:56:58,740
Exactly.

1667
01:56:58,740 --> 01:57:03,740
That's when you, when you kiss with gum, right?

1668
01:57:03,740 --> 01:57:07,740
But like, how?

1669
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:10,740
You suck it into your mouth and you kiss.

1670
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:12,740
The act with gum is passed from one person.

1671
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:16,740
Okay, yeah, that sounds nice.

1672
01:57:16,740 --> 01:57:20,740
That sounds fun.

1673
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:21,740
How romantic.

1674
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:22,740
It is romantic.

1675
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:25,740
Don't you think it's romantic?

1676
01:57:25,740 --> 01:57:26,740
I guess so, yeah.

1677
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:28,740
Because you wouldn't do that with just anybody.

1678
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:29,740
Yeah.

1679
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:30,740
I thought you were freaky.

1680
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:31,740
You're so, you're so chill.

1681
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:34,740
I guess, I guess.

1682
01:57:34,740 --> 01:57:36,740
I'm holding myself back.

1683
01:57:36,740 --> 01:57:37,740
Don't.

1684
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:40,740
Oh, wait, no, I guess if you have to hold yourself back.

1685
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:41,740
Yeah.

1686
01:57:41,740 --> 01:57:44,740
If this is my PL, I'd be a little bit more honest, but...

1687
01:57:44,740 --> 01:57:46,740
Well, it's not.

1688
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:47,740
We should...

1689
01:57:47,740 --> 01:57:49,740
Here, I'll give you, ask me any question.

1690
01:57:49,740 --> 01:57:51,740
I'll answer it completely honestly.

1691
01:57:51,740 --> 01:57:54,740
Be wise.

1692
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:55,740
I don't know.

1693
01:57:55,740 --> 01:57:57,740
I don't want to get you canceled.

1694
01:57:57,740 --> 01:58:01,740
I'm already getting canceled.

1695
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:04,740
Guys, chat, what do you want to ask her?

1696
01:58:04,740 --> 01:58:05,740
I don't know.

1697
01:58:05,740 --> 01:58:08,740
I don't want to get you canceled.

1698
01:58:08,740 --> 01:58:10,740
Yeah, pin the blame on chat.

1699
01:58:10,740 --> 01:58:12,740
That way you can't get in trouble.

1700
01:58:12,740 --> 01:58:15,740
Yeah, exactly.

1701
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:20,740
Piss-naxing.

1702
01:58:20,740 --> 01:58:24,740
Do it, stink!

1703
01:58:24,740 --> 01:58:25,740
Really?

1704
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:28,740
Out of all the questions you could ask, you asked me if it stinks.

1705
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:29,740
Yes, it does.

1706
01:58:29,740 --> 01:58:30,740
Is it pink?

1707
01:58:30,740 --> 01:58:31,740
It is pink.

1708
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:33,740
I'm a white woman.

1709
01:58:33,740 --> 01:58:36,740
Yes.

1710
01:58:36,740 --> 01:58:39,740
Body count, 500.

1711
01:58:40,740 --> 01:58:42,740
I don't think I can answer that.

1712
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:45,740
I might actually get in trouble.

1713
01:58:45,740 --> 01:58:46,740
Okay, here.

1714
01:58:46,740 --> 01:58:48,740
What's your fantasy there?

1715
01:58:48,740 --> 01:58:52,740
You can answer that.

1716
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:55,740
I have to speak in, like, YouTube terms.

1717
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:56,740
Speak in YouTube terms.

1718
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:57,740
Go ahead.

1719
01:58:57,740 --> 01:58:59,740
How do I...

1720
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:02,740
I'm going to type it too, because I don't know how to say this out loud.

1721
01:59:02,740 --> 01:59:04,740
Do you want me to translate it into YouTube?

1722
01:59:04,740 --> 01:59:05,740
Yeah, no.

1723
01:59:05,740 --> 01:59:06,740
No, I think I can...

1724
01:59:06,740 --> 01:59:07,740
Wait, hold on.

1725
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:08,740
I'll just say it.

1726
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:10,740
Grape.

1727
01:59:10,740 --> 01:59:12,740
I like grapes.

1728
01:59:12,740 --> 01:59:16,740
Grapes are delicious.

1729
01:59:16,740 --> 01:59:19,740
A big ol' grape.

1730
01:59:19,740 --> 01:59:21,740
You're very welcome here.

1731
01:59:21,740 --> 01:59:22,740
We love grape, too.

1732
01:59:22,740 --> 01:59:24,740
We love grapes.

1733
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:25,740
I like purple grapes.

1734
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:27,740
We love grapes.

1735
01:59:27,740 --> 01:59:30,740
You'll fit right in.

1736
01:59:30,740 --> 01:59:32,740
We love grapes.

1737
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:36,740
I'm actually doing a grape audio with Sheebie.

1738
01:59:37,740 --> 01:59:39,740
Is that legal?

1739
01:59:39,740 --> 01:59:40,740
I don't know.

1740
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:42,740
It's not on Patreon, so yeah.

1741
01:59:42,740 --> 01:59:43,740
Oh, okay.

1742
01:59:43,740 --> 01:59:44,740
I just asked her, I was like,

1743
01:59:44,740 --> 01:59:46,740
Yo, Sheebie, are you into grapes?

1744
01:59:46,740 --> 01:59:48,740
And she said, yeah, let's do it.

1745
01:59:48,740 --> 01:59:49,740
Grapes are delicious.

1746
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:51,740
Grapes are delicious.

1747
01:59:51,740 --> 01:59:52,740
And then we...

1748
01:59:52,740 --> 01:59:55,740
We actually recorded it together while in VC.

1749
01:59:55,740 --> 01:59:57,740
Oh, immersion.

1750
01:59:57,740 --> 02:00:00,740
A real immersion.

1751
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:02,740
Got any grapes?

1752
02:00:02,740 --> 02:00:03,740
Bum, bum, bum.

1753
02:00:03,740 --> 02:00:06,740
I know that one.

1754
02:00:06,740 --> 02:00:10,740
At least you know something.

1755
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:14,740
Not TF2, not Gmod, not Newgrounds,

1756
02:00:14,740 --> 02:00:16,740
but I'll take the grapes.

1757
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:19,740
I'll take the grapes.

1758
02:00:19,740 --> 02:00:22,740
Grape dojin is like 99% of my searches.

1759
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:25,740
I don't look at dojin that much.

1760
02:00:25,740 --> 02:00:28,740
Got any grapes?

1761
02:00:28,740 --> 02:00:30,740
Bum, bum, bum.

1762
02:00:33,740 --> 02:00:36,740
Who eats the grape in the audio?

1763
02:00:36,740 --> 02:00:38,740
Me?

1764
02:00:38,740 --> 02:00:39,740
The obvious answer.

1765
02:00:39,740 --> 02:00:40,740
Oh, really?

1766
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:42,740
Wait, wait, what does eating the grape mean?

1767
02:00:42,740 --> 02:00:44,740
Who is the one receiving the grape?

1768
02:00:44,740 --> 02:00:45,740
Me, obviously.

1769
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:47,740
Yeah, of course.

1770
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:49,740
Yeah.

1771
02:00:49,740 --> 02:00:50,740
Of course.

1772
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:53,740
It's just on Twitter, but I haven't posted it yet.

1773
02:00:53,740 --> 02:00:56,740
I've been lazy about editing it.

1774
02:00:56,740 --> 02:00:59,740
Editing takes forever.

1775
02:00:59,740 --> 02:01:01,740
I don't like it.

1776
02:01:01,740 --> 02:01:04,740
Do you edit your own audio?

1777
02:01:04,740 --> 02:01:05,740
Oh, yeah.

1778
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:06,740
You do?

1779
02:01:06,740 --> 02:01:08,740
What do you do to them?

1780
02:01:08,740 --> 02:01:12,740
Nothing.

1781
02:01:12,740 --> 02:01:16,740
I just chop them up, and then sometimes I'll add a filter,

1782
02:01:16,740 --> 02:01:18,740
and then that's it.

1783
02:01:18,740 --> 02:01:20,740
What do you mean a filter?

1784
02:01:20,740 --> 02:01:25,740
Like, sometimes I'll adjust the sliders on the equalizer kind of thing.

1785
02:01:25,740 --> 02:01:28,740
Oh, okay, because I don't know anything about audio.

1786
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:32,740
I just copy the same YouTube tutorial I found a long time ago,

1787
02:01:32,740 --> 02:01:36,740
and that's all I do.

1788
02:01:36,740 --> 02:01:40,740
But I don't know much about audio editing either.

1789
02:01:40,740 --> 02:01:42,740
I kind of don't either.

1790
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:45,740
My mic settings were also copied from another guy's.

1791
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:50,740
Yeah, it took me like three years to figure out my mic settings.

1792
02:01:50,740 --> 02:01:55,740
I couldn't scream for the longest time without my mic cutting out,

1793
02:01:55,740 --> 02:01:57,740
and it was so frustrating.

1794
02:01:57,740 --> 02:02:03,740
All of my previous clips, the funniest clips I have from the past,

1795
02:02:03,740 --> 02:02:08,740
is all me screaming and then getting muted because of my mic settings.

1796
02:02:08,740 --> 02:02:09,740
I hate that.

1797
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:10,740
I hate when that happens.

1798
02:02:10,740 --> 02:02:12,740
It ruins the entire clip.

1799
02:02:12,740 --> 02:02:13,740
It ruins the whole clip.

1800
02:02:13,740 --> 02:02:16,740
I could never post any clips of the funny moments

1801
02:02:16,740 --> 02:02:18,740
because it's like you can't even hear what I'm saying.

1802
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:21,740
Yeah, because it's just like, ah!

1803
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:23,740
I hate that.

1804
02:02:23,740 --> 02:02:29,740
Yeah, it's because of the background sound filter, that one.

1805
02:02:29,740 --> 02:02:33,740
Oh yeah, I think it's an OBS filter too.

1806
02:02:33,740 --> 02:02:35,740
Yeah, it's just called background noise.

1807
02:02:35,740 --> 02:02:36,740
The noise suppression.

1808
02:02:36,740 --> 02:02:37,740
Yeah, something like that.

1809
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:38,740
The noise suppression.

1810
02:02:38,740 --> 02:02:42,740
Turn it off and your screens will no longer be cut off.

1811
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:43,740
You're welcome.

1812
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:46,740
It took me three years to figure that one out.

1813
02:02:46,740 --> 02:02:50,740
You don't like grapes, but there's purple grapes and green grapes.

1814
02:02:50,740 --> 02:02:53,740
There's all variety of grapes.

1815
02:02:53,740 --> 02:02:55,740
There's grapes for everybody.

1816
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:59,740
I mean, not everyone has to like grapes.

1817
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:00,740
That's true.

1818
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:01,740
Yeah, we don't know.

1819
02:03:01,740 --> 02:03:03,740
But there's a wide variety of grapes to choose from.

1820
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:04,740
There is.

1821
02:03:04,740 --> 02:03:09,740
I personally like loving grapes.

1822
02:03:09,740 --> 02:03:10,740
The grape that smells bad.

1823
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:11,740
That's very sweet.

1824
02:03:11,740 --> 02:03:12,740
Yeah.

1825
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:14,740
The grape that smells bad.

1826
02:03:14,740 --> 02:03:16,740
I like that.

1827
02:03:16,740 --> 02:03:23,740
What would concord grape classify?

1828
02:03:23,740 --> 02:03:25,740
What's concord?

1829
02:03:25,740 --> 02:03:29,740
That's a kind of, I think that's a very generic grape, I think.

1830
02:03:29,740 --> 02:03:31,740
I've never heard of concord.

1831
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:34,740
What is, what?

1832
02:03:34,740 --> 02:03:39,740
It's like a purple grape, right?

1833
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:40,740
Is that multiple grape?

1834
02:03:40,740 --> 02:03:44,740
I mean, multiple grapes at once with multiple grapes.

1835
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:48,740
That's crazy.

1836
02:03:48,740 --> 02:03:51,740
Grapes with a giant sausage is a great meal.

1837
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:54,740
That is not a balanced meal.

1838
02:03:54,740 --> 02:03:58,740
I'm so confused.

1839
02:03:58,740 --> 02:03:59,740
Seedless grape?

1840
02:03:59,740 --> 02:04:01,740
I do prefer my grape seedless.

1841
02:04:01,740 --> 02:04:02,740
Yeah.

1842
02:04:02,740 --> 02:04:04,740
No, I like my grape with seed.

1843
02:04:04,740 --> 02:04:06,740
You like seed?

1844
02:04:06,740 --> 02:04:13,740
I can handle a little bit of seed, but I just don't, it gets a little too, I don't like a lot in my mouth.

1845
02:04:13,740 --> 02:04:15,740
That's fair.

1846
02:04:15,740 --> 02:04:19,740
Yeah.

1847
02:04:19,740 --> 02:04:21,740
Ooh, I want to try the cotton candy grapes.

1848
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:23,740
They look so good.

1849
02:04:23,740 --> 02:04:24,740
Is that real?

1850
02:04:24,740 --> 02:04:27,740
Yeah, they're like really sweet grapes.

1851
02:04:27,740 --> 02:04:31,740
Oh, I thought they were actually flavored like cotton candy.

1852
02:04:31,740 --> 02:04:33,740
But a seed might grow a plant.

1853
02:04:33,740 --> 02:04:36,740
We'll just have to kill the plant.

1854
02:04:36,740 --> 02:04:38,740
Kill the plant?

1855
02:04:38,740 --> 02:04:39,740
Oh, kill it.

1856
02:04:39,740 --> 02:04:41,740
Is this like a brand?

1857
02:04:41,740 --> 02:04:48,740
I think it's like, they're like big sweet grapes, I think.

1858
02:04:48,740 --> 02:04:50,740
I love me a big, big sweet grape.

1859
02:04:50,740 --> 02:04:56,740
Me too, me too.

1860
02:04:56,740 --> 02:05:00,740
We're flip-flopping between different types of grape here.

1861
02:05:00,740 --> 02:05:01,740
That's okay.

1862
02:05:01,740 --> 02:05:03,740
There's grape for all of us.

1863
02:05:03,740 --> 02:05:06,740
Have you ever tried growing any plants before?

1864
02:05:06,740 --> 02:05:08,740
Yeah, but they always die.

1865
02:05:08,740 --> 02:05:10,740
Same.

1866
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:13,740
I just, I don't, yeah, don't trust me with a plant.

1867
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:17,740
I'm trying to get into gardening because I think it's really aesthetic.

1868
02:05:17,740 --> 02:05:19,740
Like the look of it is pretty.

1869
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:20,740
It is.

1870
02:05:20,740 --> 02:05:24,740
But like all of the plants I have outside on my porch are all dead.

1871
02:05:24,740 --> 02:05:26,740
I'm trying so hard.

1872
02:05:26,740 --> 02:05:29,740
That's really sad, but also relatable.

1873
02:05:29,740 --> 02:05:31,740
It's not aesthetic anymore.

1874
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:33,740
It's just depressing looking because they're all dead.

1875
02:05:33,740 --> 02:05:34,740
They're just dead.

1876
02:05:34,740 --> 02:05:35,740
They're all dead.

1877
02:05:35,740 --> 02:05:42,740
I have a tomato plant and it's dying, but it's also like really trying hard to grow tomatoes too at the same time.

1878
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:47,740
So it's like flopping over onto the floor while still growing tomatoes.

1879
02:05:47,740 --> 02:05:48,740
It's limp.

1880
02:05:48,740 --> 02:05:49,740
It's limp now.

1881
02:05:49,740 --> 02:05:50,740
That's sad.

1882
02:05:50,740 --> 02:05:51,740
Poor thing.

1883
02:05:51,740 --> 02:05:52,740
It is sad.

1884
02:05:52,740 --> 02:05:53,740
It's trying its hardest.

1885
02:05:53,740 --> 02:05:58,740
I haven't tried the tomato, maybe I should.

1886
02:05:58,740 --> 02:06:00,740
Fresh tomatoes are so good.

1887
02:06:00,740 --> 02:06:01,740
I love tomatoes.

1888
02:06:01,740 --> 02:06:03,740
I love tomatoes too.

1889
02:06:03,740 --> 02:06:04,740
I like them a lot.

1890
02:06:04,740 --> 02:06:06,740
I don't understand how people can dislike tomatoes.

1891
02:06:06,740 --> 02:06:11,740
They don't have the greatest texture, but they have a good taste.

1892
02:06:11,740 --> 02:06:16,740
Yeah, the texture is kind of hard to get past sometimes.

1893
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:22,740
It can be, but that's why I take off the gooey part, the gooey, seedy part, and then I just eat the fleshy part of the tomato.

1894
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:24,740
I don't like the gooey part.

1895
02:06:24,740 --> 02:06:29,740
I don't like gooey things in my mouth like that if they're food.

1896
02:06:29,740 --> 02:06:34,740
I cut out the seedy part of the tomato.

1897
02:06:34,740 --> 02:06:36,740
Yeah, it's so squishy and gross.

1898
02:06:36,740 --> 02:06:38,740
Yeah, I really don't like it.

1899
02:06:38,740 --> 02:06:40,740
Yeah, I'm huge on texture for sure.

1900
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:44,740
I don't like textures of foods.

1901
02:06:44,740 --> 02:06:48,740
Yeah, it makes me sick when I have the wrong kind of texture.

1902
02:06:48,740 --> 02:06:50,740
It's enough to make me vomit actually.

1903
02:06:50,740 --> 02:06:52,740
Me too, me too, me too.

1904
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:58,740
What food is the worst texture for you?

1905
02:06:59,740 --> 02:07:04,740
I'm going to get shit on so hard for this, but I don't like grilled onions.

1906
02:07:04,740 --> 02:07:06,740
No, I don't like them either.

1907
02:07:06,740 --> 02:07:13,740
It's like they're half squishy and half like crunchy and it's like slimy.

1908
02:07:13,740 --> 02:07:14,740
I don't like it.

1909
02:07:14,740 --> 02:07:15,740
Yeah, it's like slimy.

1910
02:07:15,740 --> 02:07:16,740
I know what you mean.

1911
02:07:16,740 --> 02:07:22,740
I try really hard because I like the taste of onion rings, but I don't like the texture of the onion inside the onion rings.

1912
02:07:22,740 --> 02:07:23,740
Yeah, me too.

1913
02:07:23,740 --> 02:07:24,740
So it's really frustrating.

1914
02:07:24,740 --> 02:07:25,740
I know what you mean.

1915
02:07:25,740 --> 02:07:27,740
Grilled onions are kind of gross.

1916
02:07:27,740 --> 02:07:37,740
I personally, I don't like it when I eat stuff that's supposed to be mushy, but it has chunks on it, like yogurt with chunks on it.

1917
02:07:37,740 --> 02:07:38,740
That's gross.

1918
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:46,740
Or like, I don't like mushrooms either, but I just don't like the taste of mushrooms in general.

1919
02:07:46,740 --> 02:07:49,740
I always got shit on for not liking mushrooms.

1920
02:07:49,740 --> 02:07:50,740
Me too.

1921
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:52,740
I was always told they're a flavor sponge.

1922
02:07:52,740 --> 02:07:55,740
If you don't like how they taste, it's because the flavor you're putting into is bad.

1923
02:07:55,740 --> 02:07:56,740
We'll shut the fuck up.

1924
02:07:56,740 --> 02:07:57,740
I just don't like mushrooms.

1925
02:07:57,740 --> 02:07:58,740
They taste like dirt.

1926
02:07:58,740 --> 02:07:59,740
They do taste like dirt.

1927
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:02,740
A lot of vegetables taste like dirt, to be honest.

1928
02:08:02,740 --> 02:08:03,740
They do.

1929
02:08:03,740 --> 02:08:04,740
A lot of vegetables taste like dirt.

1930
02:08:04,740 --> 02:08:05,740
And yes, I wash them.

1931
02:08:05,740 --> 02:08:06,740
I wash them.

1932
02:08:06,740 --> 02:08:07,740
They still taste like dirt.

1933
02:08:07,740 --> 02:08:09,740
They taste like shit, dude.

1934
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:11,740
They really do.

1935
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:13,740
They really taste like nothing.

1936
02:08:13,740 --> 02:08:17,740
It's the texture and the taste.

1937
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:18,740
Good dirt.

1938
02:08:18,740 --> 02:08:22,740
There's no such thing as good dirt, but like good dirt.

1939
02:08:22,740 --> 02:08:25,740
But you know, yeah, grilled onions remove the bite.

1940
02:08:25,740 --> 02:08:29,740
If you made me choose between a raw onion and grilled onions, I would eat grilled onions.

1941
02:08:29,740 --> 02:08:30,740
Me too.

1942
02:08:30,740 --> 02:08:31,740
Me too, yeah.

1943
02:08:31,740 --> 02:08:32,740
Raw onion.

1944
02:08:32,740 --> 02:08:34,740
I don't know why people would want to eat a raw onion.

1945
02:08:34,740 --> 02:08:35,740
That's crazy.

1946
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:36,740
I don't know.

1947
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:38,740
Maybe they're shrek.

1948
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:41,740
The acid breath.

1949
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:43,740
Gonna change your pH balance.

1950
02:08:43,740 --> 02:08:44,740
Holy crap.

1951
02:08:44,740 --> 02:08:47,740
Do people eat raw onions?

1952
02:08:47,740 --> 02:08:51,740
I've seen this girl on TikTok who eats raw onions.

1953
02:08:51,740 --> 02:08:52,740
Ew.

1954
02:08:52,740 --> 02:08:53,740
Yeah, it is ew.

1955
02:08:53,740 --> 02:08:55,740
And it's like a purple onion.

1956
02:08:55,740 --> 02:08:58,740
Oh, brussels sprouts are gross too.

1957
02:08:58,740 --> 02:08:59,740
Ew, I don't like them.

1958
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:01,740
I like broccoli.

1959
02:09:01,740 --> 02:09:03,740
You like broccoli?

1960
02:09:03,740 --> 02:09:06,740
I like it better when it's raw because it's crunchy.

1961
02:09:06,740 --> 02:09:08,740
I don't like broccoli.

1962
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:10,740
Broccoli tastes like ass.

1963
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:11,740
And smells like ass.

1964
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:12,740
It smells like a fart.

1965
02:09:12,740 --> 02:09:13,740
Exactly.

1966
02:09:13,740 --> 02:09:14,740
It smells like a fart.

1967
02:09:14,740 --> 02:09:15,740
Thank you.

1968
02:09:15,740 --> 02:09:20,740
Every single time I say that broccoli smells bad, people are like, what do you mean broccoli

1969
02:09:20,740 --> 02:09:21,740
doesn't smell like anything?

1970
02:09:21,740 --> 02:09:22,740
It smells like a fart.

1971
02:09:22,740 --> 02:09:23,740
It smells like a fart.

1972
02:09:23,740 --> 02:09:24,740
It really does.

1973
02:09:24,740 --> 02:09:25,740
It smells like dookie.

1974
02:09:25,740 --> 02:09:26,740
It smells like dookie.

1975
02:09:26,740 --> 02:09:30,740
And no one has believed me until now.

1976
02:09:30,740 --> 02:09:31,740
Thank you, Momosa.

1977
02:09:31,740 --> 02:09:33,740
People are always like a broccoli.

1978
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:34,740
Does it smell like anything?

1979
02:09:34,740 --> 02:09:36,740
It smells like a fart.

1980
02:09:36,740 --> 02:09:37,740
It does.

1981
02:09:37,740 --> 02:09:38,740
It does.

1982
02:09:38,740 --> 02:09:42,740
Especially when you grill them or not grill them when you steam them or whatever and

1983
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:43,740
you put butter.

1984
02:09:43,740 --> 02:09:46,740
It smells like butter and hot ass.

1985
02:09:46,740 --> 02:09:49,740
Butter and hot ass.

1986
02:09:49,740 --> 02:09:50,740
Yes.

1987
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:54,740
You like carrots?

1988
02:09:54,740 --> 02:09:55,740
I'm okay with carrots.

1989
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:56,740
I can handle carrots.

1990
02:09:56,740 --> 02:09:57,740
I love carrots.

1991
02:09:57,740 --> 02:09:58,740
They're just like carrots.

1992
02:09:58,740 --> 02:10:02,740
I just don't like how carrots are like bitter.

1993
02:10:02,740 --> 02:10:03,740
I don't know.

1994
02:10:03,740 --> 02:10:05,740
I don't like bitter stuff.

1995
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:06,740
That's true.

1996
02:10:06,740 --> 02:10:10,740
I feel like some carrots taste kind of bitter.

1997
02:10:10,740 --> 02:10:16,240
When I was younger, my dad used to try to convince me to eat carrots because he would

1998
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:17,240
open the carrot.

1999
02:10:17,240 --> 02:10:19,240
Well, actually, I think he genuinely thought this.

2000
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:20,240
I don't know.

2001
02:10:20,240 --> 02:10:24,240
He's the kind of guy that's like, oh, if you eat enough vegetables, you could cure your

2002
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:25,240
cancer.

2003
02:10:25,240 --> 02:10:28,100
But I had really bad eyesight since I was a kid.

2004
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:31,240
So he cut open a carrot and he was like, look inside the carrot.

2005
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:32,240
What's the fun?

2006
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:35,240
And I looked inside the carrot and I was like, I don't see anything in the carrot.

2007
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:36,240
Bro is schizo-maxing.

2008
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:37,240
What?

2009
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:40,240
And he said, look inside the carrot.

2010
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:43,240
There's an eye in the carrot.

2011
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:44,240
What?

2012
02:10:44,240 --> 02:10:47,240
I think he was a strange man.

2013
02:10:47,240 --> 02:10:50,240
But I was like, dad, I don't see anything inside the carrot.

2014
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:54,240
And he was like, there's an eye inside the carrot.

2015
02:10:54,240 --> 02:11:00,240
And if you eat enough carrots, it'll cure your eyesight because like I had bad eyesight

2016
02:11:00,240 --> 02:11:02,240
since I was a child.

2017
02:11:02,240 --> 02:11:03,240
Yeah.

2018
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:07,240
And that's how he would try to convince me to eat more carrots because there were eyes

2019
02:11:07,240 --> 02:11:09,240
inside of the carrot.

2020
02:11:09,240 --> 02:11:10,240
That's so creepy.

2021
02:11:10,240 --> 02:11:11,240
Yeah.

2022
02:11:11,240 --> 02:11:18,240
What's your prescription for your glasses?

2023
02:11:18,240 --> 02:11:21,240
It's around negative five.

2024
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:24,240
Do you know like if you're like, are you 2100?

2025
02:11:24,240 --> 02:11:25,240
I don't know.

2026
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:28,240
Is that a thing you use in Canada?

2027
02:11:28,240 --> 02:11:32,240
No, maybe, but I don't, I don't have it like memorized.

2028
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:33,240
Oh, okay.

2029
02:11:33,240 --> 02:11:38,240
I don't remember my like, I have myopia.

2030
02:11:38,240 --> 02:11:43,240
That's like far up near, near sided, I think.

2031
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:48,240
So does that mean like close things are blurry?

2032
02:11:48,240 --> 02:11:57,240
So when I can't see from far away, I might have 2100 vision in both eyes, which is like,

2033
02:11:57,240 --> 02:12:07,240
I think I'm halfway there to being legally blind.

2034
02:12:07,240 --> 02:12:09,240
Diopters.

2035
02:12:09,240 --> 02:12:21,240
Okay, 2100 is between negative two and negative three, it says.

2036
02:12:21,240 --> 02:12:23,240
Oh, so yours is worse than mine.

2037
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:27,240
Yeah, I'm at 2400.

2038
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:28,240
You're legally blind.

2039
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:29,240
No, I'm not.

2040
02:12:29,240 --> 02:12:30,240
That's crazy.

2041
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:31,240
Yes, you are.

2042
02:12:31,240 --> 02:12:33,240
What is legally blinding?

2043
02:12:33,240 --> 02:12:39,240
I think here in America isn't it 2200 is legally blind?

2044
02:12:39,240 --> 02:12:42,240
What is legally blind?

2045
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:47,240
Yeah, 2200 is considered legally blind in America.

2046
02:12:47,240 --> 02:12:50,240
What does legally blind even mean?

2047
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:52,240
You can't drive.

2048
02:12:52,240 --> 02:12:53,240
Oh, that's it.

2049
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:55,240
Yeah, of course I can't drive with the light glasses.

2050
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:56,240
Yeah.

2051
02:12:56,240 --> 02:12:59,240
Yeah, I'm very lucky, but I'm just built different.

2052
02:12:59,240 --> 02:13:04,240
Is yours corrected to 2020?

2053
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:05,240
I think so, yeah.

2054
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:07,240
Yeah, mine's corrected to 2020.

2055
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:08,240
Yeah.

2056
02:13:08,240 --> 02:13:10,240
Yeah, without the glasses.

2057
02:13:10,240 --> 02:13:12,240
Yeah, I have it on my driver's license.

2058
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:13,240
Me too, yeah.

2059
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:16,240
Yeah, don't drive without your glasses, but I think I could do it.

2060
02:13:16,240 --> 02:13:17,240
I think I could pull it off.

2061
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:19,240
I've done it before.

2062
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:21,240
Well, yours is okay.

2063
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:23,240
I think you can do it for sure.

2064
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:24,240
I just have to be careful.

2065
02:13:24,240 --> 02:13:27,240
I wouldn't be able to see like a squirrel or anything running across the road.

2066
02:13:27,240 --> 02:13:28,240
Poor squirrel.

2067
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:31,240
Maybe if like it was a small child.

2068
02:13:31,240 --> 02:13:33,240
It's going to get turned into roadkill.

2069
02:13:33,240 --> 02:13:36,240
Yeah, both of them.

2070
02:13:36,240 --> 02:13:37,240
Okay.

2071
02:13:37,240 --> 02:13:45,240
I think I'll stop the collab here because I've been holding in my pee for the last hour.

2072
02:13:45,240 --> 02:13:47,240
For me, just for me.

2073
02:13:47,240 --> 02:13:49,240
Just for you.

2074
02:13:49,240 --> 02:13:50,240
Ah.

2075
02:13:50,240 --> 02:13:55,240
Oh my God, the most is an emanated joyer.

2076
02:13:55,240 --> 02:13:56,240
I am.

2077
02:13:56,240 --> 02:13:58,240
Momosa, did you want to keep streaming?

2078
02:13:58,240 --> 02:14:00,240
No, I'm actually starving.

2079
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:01,240
Okay.

2080
02:14:01,240 --> 02:14:03,240
Do you want to read the same person?

2081
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:05,240
Yeah, who should I read?

2082
02:14:05,240 --> 02:14:09,240
Um, who should she be streaming?

2083
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:11,240
Let me just make sure she's not ending.

2084
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:12,240
Okay.

2085
02:14:12,240 --> 02:14:14,240
Gotta ship it.

2086
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:16,240
She be three hours.

2087
02:14:16,240 --> 02:14:17,240
I'm a need.

2088
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:18,240
I'm a need.

2089
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:19,240
Oh my God, she has a cat cam.

2090
02:14:19,240 --> 02:14:20,240
That's so cute.

2091
02:14:20,240 --> 02:14:21,240
Hi.

2092
02:14:22,240 --> 02:14:23,240
Um.

2093
02:14:25,240 --> 02:14:27,240
She be say something.

2094
02:14:30,240 --> 02:14:35,240
She be, are you gonna keep streaming?

2095
02:14:35,240 --> 02:14:50,240
Okay.

2096
02:14:50,240 --> 02:14:51,240
She's playing faith.

2097
02:14:51,240 --> 02:14:53,240
I don't know what faith is.

2098
02:14:53,240 --> 02:14:55,240
It's not a bad game.

2099
02:14:55,240 --> 02:14:56,240
It's very religious though.

2100
02:14:56,240 --> 02:14:58,240
Did you see she got her tan model?

2101
02:14:58,240 --> 02:14:59,240
Is that the tan model?

2102
02:14:59,240 --> 02:15:00,240
Wait, really?

2103
02:15:00,240 --> 02:15:02,240
Yeah, she be got a tan model.

2104
02:15:02,240 --> 02:15:04,240
I'm clicking right now.

2105
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:05,240
Yeah.

2106
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:08,240
Oh, she, oh, that's so cute.

2107
02:15:08,240 --> 02:15:10,240
I like it.

2108
02:15:10,240 --> 02:15:11,240
Did she answer my question?

2109
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:13,240
I accidentally clicked off.

2110
02:15:13,240 --> 02:15:15,240
I don't know.

2111
02:15:15,240 --> 02:15:16,240
Okay.

2112
02:15:16,240 --> 02:15:18,240
Well, let's just read her and hope she doesn't need to end.

2113
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:19,240
Okay.

2114
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:21,240
Okay.

2115
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:23,240
Uh.

2116
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:25,240
Bye.

2117
02:15:25,240 --> 02:15:26,240
Bye.

2118
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:28,240
So and holy trinity.

2119
02:15:28,240 --> 02:15:30,240
Thank you guys for joining our collab.

2120
02:15:30,240 --> 02:15:32,240
It was the collab of all time.

2121
02:15:32,240 --> 02:15:33,240
It definitely was.

2122
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:37,240
We had a lot of interesting conversations.

2123
02:15:37,240 --> 02:15:40,240
For sure.

2124
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:44,240
She just said hi.

2125
02:15:44,240 --> 02:15:45,240
You learned a lot.

2126
02:15:45,240 --> 02:15:46,240
That's good.

2127
02:15:46,240 --> 02:15:50,240
I hope you learned a lot about us and our blood clots and our periods.

2128
02:15:50,240 --> 02:15:52,240
I hope you did.

2129
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:53,240
She said yes, apparently.

2130
02:15:53,240 --> 02:15:55,240
So I guess we could write her.

2131
02:15:55,240 --> 02:15:56,240
Okay.

2132
02:15:56,240 --> 02:15:57,240
Good.

2133
02:15:57,240 --> 02:15:58,240
Good.

2134
02:15:58,240 --> 02:15:59,240
Good.

2135
02:15:59,240 --> 02:16:00,240
Okay.

2136
02:16:00,240 --> 02:16:01,240
Thank you guys.

2137
02:16:01,240 --> 02:16:06,240
Have a fun time in, uh, in she be stream.

2138
02:16:06,240 --> 02:16:12,240
Um, um, see you.

2139
02:16:12,240 --> 02:16:13,240
Yeah.

2140
02:16:13,240 --> 02:16:14,240
Yeah.

2141
02:16:14,240 --> 02:16:16,240
Thank you for watching.

2142
02:16:16,240 --> 02:16:21,240
It's so awkward ending a collab.

2143
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:22,240
Bye.

2144
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:33,240
Yeah.

2145
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:02,240
Yeah.
