you will not pass out afterwards

1123
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,400

1124
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,400

1126
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,400
my bed's kinda dirty

1127
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,400

1128
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,400
sorry, I'm still waiting on my nails to dry

1129
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,400
until I start on the other ones

1130
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,400
this nail polish is kinda shit

1131
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,400
jealous?

1132
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,400
gel-ish?

1133
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,400
any femme boys out there watching?

1134
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,400
I don't recommend this one

1135
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,400
it takes forever to dry

1136
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,400
okay?

1137
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,400
gel-ish in the color hot red

1138
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,400
hot red

1139
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,400
gel-ish in the color hot

1140
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,400
red red, hot red red

1141
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,400
don't recommend it

1142
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,400
it takes too long to dry

1143
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:42,400
and it's fucking spreading everywhere

1144
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,400
just dry

1145
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,400
oh my god

1146
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,400
is it because I put-

1147
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,400
stop

1148
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,400
what do I do, should I blow on it?

1149
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,400
can you blow on it for me?

1150
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,400
blow on the screen

1151
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,400
help me get it to dry

1152
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,400
come on, keep blowing, like those DS games

1153
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,400
you know those DS games that would make you blow on the screen

1154
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,400
I can't even keep my foot up for that long

1155
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,400
if the bed kinda dirty, we don't need any pads then

1156
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,400
there you go

1157
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,400
what do you mean by that?

1158
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,400
do you mind if I take a quick nap?

1159
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,400
while I wait for this to dry

1160
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,400
I'm just gonna lay down a little bit, okay?

1161
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,400
don't worry, I won't fall asleep

1162
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,400
I won't fall asleep, look out

1163
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1164
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1165
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1166
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1167
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1168
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1169
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1170
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1171
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1172
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1173
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1174
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1175
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1176
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1177
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1178
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,400
you know

1179
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1180
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

1181
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,400
I'm not gonna fall asleep

01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,400

Anonymous tipped four dollars and twenty cents.

1191
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:26,340
The gel kind won't dry without a UV lamp to cure it.

1192
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:33,340
Ooh, I didn't realize that this is a gel polish.

1193
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:36,340
Oh fuck, I didn't realize this is a gel.

1194
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:38,340
Oh, I didn't see that you're right.

1195
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,340
Oh, you're so smart.

1196
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:43,340
Ah, we gotta finboy and chat to help me.

1197
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:45,340
Thank you so much.

1198
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:48,340
I didn't see that it's a gel polish.

1199
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:52,340
Oh, I'm so mad right now.

1200
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:54,340
Alright, you're right, you're right, you're right.

1201
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:56,340
Sorry, okay, okay, okay.

1202
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:57,340
Change of plans, change of plans.

1203
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:00,340
We're going black and we're not going back

1204
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:03,340
because black is the only other going out polish I have

1205
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:09,340
and I don't have a UV lamp to cure this.

1206
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,340
I'm so sorry, I didn't realize this is a gel.

1207
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:13,340
Oh, I'm a stupid bitch.

1208
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:16,340
I want hot rod red, okay.

1209
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,340
I'm going to go...

1210
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:19,340
What am I going to do?

1211
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:24,340
Okay, let's wipe this off first with my, um, disgusting...

1212
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:26,340
Ew.

1213
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:29,340
With my disgusting snot.

1214
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:31,340
Snot napkins.

1215
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,340
Fuck, why am I such a dumb bitch?

1216
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:37,340
This is why I need you in my life to help me.

1217
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:42,340
No, I don't have to start from zero.

1218
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:44,340
I'm just...

1219
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:47,340
I just have to wipe off what's here.

1220
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:53,340
I just have to wipe it all off.

1221
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:00,340
I wasn't paying attention when I was shopping around.

1222
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:02,340
I was wondering, I would have stayed here forever

1223
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:04,340
waiting for it to dry.

1224
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,340
Thank you so much.

1225
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:09,340
Thank you.

1226
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:15,340
Okay.

1227
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:18,340
Is that good enough?

1228
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:20,340
It kind of looks like I dipped my toenails

1229
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:25,340
in some gross, like, purity cooch.

1230
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:30,340
Right?

1231
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,340
I'm so tired.

1232
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:35,340
Someone with a blue wrench mentioned it earlier.

1233
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:38,340
Most of the rest of us probably would not have noticed

1234
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,340
your mistake.

1235
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:42,340
I didn't see, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1236
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:50,340
I'm not a family boy, I'm sorry.

1237
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:53,340
Hold on, I'm sorry.

1238
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:57,340
Forgive me.

1239
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:59,340
Forgive me.

1240
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:02,340
Okay, I'm gonna go give my black nail polish.

1241
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:06,340
I'm also gonna give it my trash can.

1242
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:10,340
Okay, let me actually wipe this well.

1243
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:12,340
Because I'm dumb, bitch.

1244
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:14,340
I'm actually so disappointed myself.

1245
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:16,340
I don't know, ow!

1246
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:20,340
I don't know how I didn't see that it said gel.

1247
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:23,340
I didn't see that, I swear!

1248
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:26,340
It wasn't me, it wasn't me.

1249
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:29,340
The girl you saw earlier was not me.

1250
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:41,340
Ow, is that what it also kind of hurts too?

1251
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:43,340
I mean, not that I'm complaining,

1252
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:46,340
but something on my toenails is burning me.

1253
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:51,340
Okay.

1254
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:56,340
No, that's just you.

1255
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,340
Okay.

1256
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,340
Okay.

1257
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:04,340
Okay, I'll be right back.

1258
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:08,340
I'll go get black nail polish that is not gel.

1259
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:11,340
And I will also get the garbage can

1260
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:16,340
because we be shittin' out all this paper towel

1261
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:20,340
and I got nowhere to put it.

1262
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:23,340
I'll be right back.

1263
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,340
Okay.

1264
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:06,340
Okay.

1265
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:08,340
Okay.

1266
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:10,340
Okay.

1267
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,340
Okay.

1268
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:14,340
Okay.

1269
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:16,340
Okay.

1270
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,340
Okay.

1271
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:20,340
Okay.

1272
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,340
Okay.

1273
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:24,340
Okay.

1274
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,340
Okay.

1275
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:30,340
Okay.

1276
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:32,340
Okay.

1277
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:34,340
Okay.

1278
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,340
Okay.

1279
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:49,340
Okay.

1280
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:53,340
Okay.

1281
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,340
Okay.

1282
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:02,340
Why are you acting so gay?

1283
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:03,340
My pants are fine.

1284
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:11,340
I don't know, man.

1285
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:13,340
Beauty is pain.

1286
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:14,340
Oh, shit.

1287
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:16,340
Off with the sweater!

1288
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:18,340
Off with the sweater!

1289
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:21,340
Oh, you little tease.

1290
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:23,340
Off with the sweater.

1291
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:27,340
I'm not taking it off.

1292
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:29,340
I already took it off for

1293
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:32,340
my ASMR.

1294
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:38,340
It felt super fucking weird doing that, by the way.

1295
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,340
I took off my shirt for my ASMR stream

1296
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:44,340
so that you could hear my heartbeat better.

1297
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:46,340
And, um,

1298
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:49,340
I felt like I was like a mother, like,

1299
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:52,340
breastfeeding her baby.

1300
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:56,340
Which is like the worst I hate that feeling.

1301
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:58,340
I don't like that feeling.

1302
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,340
That's the worst feeling ever.

1303
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:03,340
I don't like it.

1304
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:06,340
So I'm not doing that this time.

1305
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:14,340
Thank you, Link, for becoming a pinball.

1306
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,340
Off with the skin as well?

1307
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:20,340
Yeah.

1308
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,340
Off.

1309
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:25,340
Feed the mic stand?

1310
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:27,340
What does that mean?

1311
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:30,340
Like, milk?

1312
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:33,340
I don't want to get black on it.

1313
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:36,340
Black on what?

1314
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:39,340
Right, I brought...

1315
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:41,340
Whoa, I'm dizzy.

1316
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:45,340
I brought a trash can.

1317
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:53,340
Amy prefers to be on the receiving and breastfeeding.

1318
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:55,340
Aha!

1319
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:57,340
You know what, actually...

1320
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,340
Oh god, I'm gonna puke.

1321
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,340
Sorry, I'm not gonna puke.

1322
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:04,340
Well, I might.

1323
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:07,340
I'm gonna puke on stream.

1324
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:09,340
Actually, maybe I shouldn't drink more.

1325
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:12,340
How much did you drink so far?

1326
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:16,340
Um, around half of this much.

1327
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:17,340
So like...

1328
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:22,340
Are you gay?

1329
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:24,340
Why are you acting so gay?

1330
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:27,340
Barotiped $3.33.

1331
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:30,340
A stethoscope helps with ASMR heartbeat recording.

1332
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:33,340
Also, 10 out of 10 on that last one.

1333
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:35,340
And every other before that.

1334
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,340
Thank you.

1335
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:41,340
So I drink, um...

1336
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:48,340
Half of this, which this is 750ml.

1337
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:50,340
So about 350ml.

1338
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:52,340
Is that half of 750?

1339
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:58,340
7 divided by 2 is 250?

1340
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:02,340
And then add another...

1341
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:03,340
Oh fuck.

1342
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:04,340
Oh fuck.

1343
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:11,340
Add another 50%?

1344
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,340
375.

1345
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:13,340
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

1346
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:14,340
I didn't look at chat at all.

1347
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:19,340
375, 375, 375.

1348
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:20,340
Yup.

1349
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:23,340
I drink about 375ml.

1350
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:25,340
This isn't gel, right?

1351
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:27,340
This is not what I've been using.

1352
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:28,340
It's not gel.

1353
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:31,340
3.5, YEAH!

1354
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:34,340
I got it right, right?

1355
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:36,340
I'm gonna use more math homework.

1356
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:37,340
You know what's really funny?

1357
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:39,340
A lot of people thought I was faking it.

1358
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:42,340
Like faking being bad at math.

1359
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:44,340
For that stream.

1360
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:47,340
Dude, you don't even know.

1361
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:51,340
I got faking nail polish on my light.

1362
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:55,340
You don't even know half of the story.

1363
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:59,340
I'm genuinely really really bad at math.

1364
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:01,340
And it's honestly really depressing.

1365
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:04,340
And it makes me really sad.

1366
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:08,340
Like no, you guys don't understand how bad...

1367
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:11,340
Someone faking sent me a marshmallow asking if I had dyscalcula.

1368
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:12,340
Dyscalcula?

1369
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,340
Is that it?

1370
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:15,340
I might have dyscalcula, I don't know.

1371
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:19,340
But I've gotten this far without the diagnosis, so I don't know.

1372
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:21,340
I used to be in um...

1373
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:30,340
I used to be in IB math with my bestie when I was in high school.

1374
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:33,340
I just wanted to be with my bestie and I was like,

1375
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:35,340
Sure, I'll take IB with you.

1376
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:38,340
And it was so stressful for me.

1377
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:42,340
Because every like for our math classes.

1378
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:46,340
Sorry, if you don't know what IB is, it's basically AP classes, right?

1379
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:51,340
And it was so stressful for me because

1380
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:57,340
Like for every faking 30 minutes that my friend had to study for math class.

1381
01:22:57,340 --> 01:23:01,340
I had to study for like 2 hours to get the same grade.

1382
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:04,340
And I hated it because, you know,

1383
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:10,340
My friend was having such an easy time with it and she never had to study for tests.

1384
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:14,340
And I always had to study like twice as hard as her,

1385
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:18,340
Three times as hard as her just to keep up and get the same grades as her.

1386
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:21,340
And it made me want to kill myself.

1387
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:23,340
It wasn't fair.

1388
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:27,340
Or even lower grades than her too sometimes.

1389
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:30,340
And I remember during exam time,

1390
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:37,340
I studied like every day for multiple hours and she just kind of like chillaxed with us in class.

1391
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:42,340
And like casually did some practice questions with the whole group in class

1392
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:44,340
And then didn't study at all other than that.

1393
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:47,340
And she got the same grade as me.

1394
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:51,340
I wanted to jump off of a bridge in Minecraft after that.

1395
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:55,340
Because I would stay after class just to study math.

1396
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:57,340
Oh, you're gonna make me cry.

1397
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:59,340
Shut up, Amy.

1398
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:01,340
Bro, high school was a shit time.

1399
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:03,340
I never want to go back to that.

1400
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,340
How long has the stream been?

1401
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:11,340
I can't see when how?

1402
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:13,340
One hour and 24 minutes.

1403
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,340
Okay, I'll try to keep...

1404
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:22,340
I'll try to keep going until two hours, I think.

1405
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:25,340
Going, my voice gets so annoying when I'm drunk.

1406
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:27,340
It's because I can't keep up.

1407
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:30,340
Okay, I'm gonna wait until this is dry now.

1408
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:32,340
It was pain.

1409
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:34,340
Yeah, stay in middle school.

1410
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:36,340
Ahahahahaha...

1411
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:39,340
Ahahahahaha...

1412
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:40,340
Funny.

1413
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:44,340
Or should I say cuddly?

1414
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:47,340
Your voice is 10 out of 10.

1415
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:50,340
When I'm drunk it's annoying as fuck, dude.

1416
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:59,340
Cuddly!

1417
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:03,340
Woooow!

1418
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:06,340
I'm trying to wipe off.

1419
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:10,340
I really hope I'm not annoying my neighbors by screaming.

1420
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:14,340
I'm trying to wipe off the red at the bottom here.

1421
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:16,340
I'm only getting black.

1422
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:24,340
I gotta keep hiding my viewer count.

1423
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:26,340
I don't wanna see that shit, it makes me nervous.

1424
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:28,340
There we go. Is your foot still hurting?

1425
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:32,340
My foot still hurting?

1426
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:34,340
Are you an OG that knows about my foot cramps?

1427
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:38,340
I have really bad foot cramps.

1428
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:42,340
I get really bad foot cramps sometimes.

1429
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:44,340
Yes, it doesn't go away ever.

1430
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:46,340
I was born with it because...

1431
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:48,340
I don't know.

1432
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:50,340
They said something about me having arch problems.

1433
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:54,340
I feel like my arch is cute.

1434
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:56,340
There's nothing wrong with it. It's really cute.

1435
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:58,340
I'm not tensing up my foot at all.

1436
01:25:58,340 --> 01:26:00,340
This is how my foot is shaped.

1437
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:02,340
It is completely relaxed.

1438

It's completely relaxed at the moment.

1441
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:16,340
I'm not tensing it up at all.

1442
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:18,340
I feel like it's a perfect shape.

1443

It is cute.

1444
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:22,340

1449
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:32,340
It's a good shape, right?

1450
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:34,340
Don't tell me it's not a good shape.

1451
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:36,340
So, yeah.

1452
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:38,340

1454
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:42,340
But I'm too lazy for that.

1455
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:44,340
I'm too lazy, so I don't.

1456

Yeah, it's a great shape.

1457

Perfect shape, that's what I'm saying.

Emmy, you're too hard on yourself and it makes me sad. You're always your own biggest self critic. Cheer up a bit, as your big brother I get depressed when you're sad. You're a great little sister less than three.

01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:00,800
Hold on.

1599
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:05,800
I'm okay.

1600
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,800
I'm okay. I don't know what you're talking about.

1601
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:32,800
I am completely sane and sober and not crying at all.

1602
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:39,800
You know this is the first time I've actually actually shed a tear on stream?

1603
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:43,800
I mean I didn't shed a tear but like I was like close to it.

1604
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:48,800
It's so cringe though.

1605
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:49,800
It's so cringe.

1606
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:51,800
Why are you crying on stream for me?

1607
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,800
I mean everyone can do it out there.

1608
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:00,800
I don't judge other people for doing it but I feel like it's cringe if I do it.

1609
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,800
So I don't like to do it.

1610
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:04,800
Is this three?

1611
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:06,800
One, two, three, one, two, three.

1612
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:07,800
Okay, last one or three.

1613
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,800
I don't know if I'll have enough. We'll see.

1614
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:11,800
One, two, three.

1615
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:13,800
I think we will. I think I will.

1616
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:16,800
No.

1617
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,800
Strawny knows where my butt is.

1618
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,800
Anyways, Amy is the best sister in the world.

1619
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:28,800
And she's the only girl I need in my life.

1620
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:29,800
And I love her a lot.

1621
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:31,800
Are you gay?

1622
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,800
Why are you acting so gay?

1623
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:41,800
Are you gay?

1624
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,800
Why are you acting so gay?

1625
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:51,800
Are you gay?

1626
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,800
Why are you acting so gay?

1627
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:54,800
Stop loving me.

1628
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:03,800
These little bitch tears.

1629
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:05,800
They're not bitch tears.

1630
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,800
You're the bitch here.

1631
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:08,800
Shut up.

1632
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:13,800
I ran out of tiny ones so we're gonna have to make the last couple ones kind of thick.

1633
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:16,800
I just think so.

1634
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,800
Is this one tiny?

1635
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,800
No, that one's pretty...

1636
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:21,800
Kik.

1637
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,800
Okay, we're almost done with these nails.

1647
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,800
How do I do this? I just play.

1648
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:10,800
There was this one person in my community that I kind of trusted a lot because they were part of my friend group.

1649
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:19,800
They were part of my Minecraft, not my Minecraft streamer friend group, but they were just part of my small streamer friend group.

1650
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:29,800
You know, I trusted all those people in my small streamer friend group because we were all cringy little streamers that streamed art in Minecraft.

1651
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:31,800
Right?

1652
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:34,800
I know I was family-friendly before.

1653
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:41,800
Okay, not completely family-friendly, but like, I was pretty family-friendly if you ask me.

1654
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:43,800
Are you gay?

1655
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,800
Why are you acting so gay?

1656
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:48,800
I'm on Bro Tip $6.90.

1657
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:51,800
Hey, I heard you drinking some Irish cream.

1658
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:55,800
Well, I got some Irish cream for your right here pants grab.

1659
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:58,800
Are you Irish?

1660
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:05,800
I don't mean to be rude, but every Irish slash Scottish accent just kind of reminds me of Shrek.

1661
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:09,800
Even like, strongy's accent reminds me of Shrek, don't tell her I said that.

1662
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:12,800
Not in a bad way or anything, I just think it does.

1663
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,800
I don't know if I could be sexually attracted to Shrek.

1664
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:18,800
God, I want him to step on me.

1665
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:21,800
I'll step on you if you want.

1666
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:22,800
What was I saying?

1667
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:26,800
Right, when I was a small Minecraft streamer, there was this person in my community that I trusted a lot.

1668
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:31,800
You know, we would watch each other's streams because I had like a little stream friend group.

1669
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:40,800
And one time, someone was like, hey, by the way, I got on a call with X person and they were shit-talking you.

1670
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:45,800
And I was like, shit-talking me?

1671
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:53,800
I mean, not surprising, there's a lot of shit-talk you could do on me, I'm pretty easy as shit-talk.

1672
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:59,800
But they were like, yeah, they were shit-talking me and also they were trying to...

1673
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,800
Groom me.

1674
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:06,800
And I was like, Groom you!

1675
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:13,800
In my server, apparently more likely than you think, cause that person was a minor.

1676
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:20,800
And anyways, that broke my trust, that broke my trust in any new internet friends for a long time.

1677
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:25,800
Cause I felt so bad for, cause that person was like a really good viewer friend of mine.

1678
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:31,800
Cause you know, I was a family-friendly Minecraft streamer, so I attracted a lot of kids, which was fine.

1679
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:35,800
Cause you know, we'd be up in here family-friendly Minecraft streaming.

1680
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:42,800
So I attracted a lot of kids and I was like, oh man, this is all my fucking fault, dude.

1681
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,800
All my fault.

1682
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:49,800
Anyways, so that's why we don't deal, we don't, we don't do kids anymore.

1683
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:52,800
We don't do that here.

1684
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:55,800
I still feel bad about it till this day.

1685
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:58,800
I can't believe I let that happen.

1686
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,800
Cause they were like friends with me.

1687
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:08,800
Guys, don't let anyone groom you.

1688
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,800
What is with Minecraft streamer?

1689
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:13,800
Okay, I didn't do anything.

1690
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:15,800
I didn't do anything.

1691
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:18,800
I just kind of didn't know what was happening.

1692
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:21,800
I saw the red flags too, but I was a stupid bitch.

1693
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:24,800
I mean, I'm always a stupid bitch. What do you expect from me?

1694
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,800
I'd always be bitchin' and stupid.

1695
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,800
Let me take a shwig.

1696
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:36,800
I have worse stories than that, but I can't say them.

1697
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:39,800
I can't say them.

1698
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:44,800
Yeah, don't let anyone groom you except for me.

1699
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:50,800
But make sure you're over 18 if you want me to groom you.

1700
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:52,800
Fuck.

1701
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:57,800
My thunder cunt of an ex tried to groom me and manipulate me.

1702
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,800
F me up, yeah.

1703
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:01,800
I know.

1704
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:02,800
I know.

1705
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:03,800
I know.

1706
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:04,800
I know.

1707
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:05,800
I know.

1708
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:06,800
I know.

1709
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,800
F me up, yeah.

1710
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:10,800
I know.

1711
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,800
It sucks balls.

1712
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:15,800
But what if I want you to groom me?

1713
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:16,800
Make me worse.

1714
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,800
No, I'll do it.

1715
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,800
I'll do it if you want me to.

1716
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,800
Anything for you, baby girl.

1717
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,800
Or baby boy.

1718
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:29,800
Or a brother.

1719
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:35,800
I'm getting my freakin' forehead sweat all over my microphone.

1720
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,800
What time is it? 1.47.

1721
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:38,800
Okay.

1722
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:42,800
Thank you for becoming a pin pal dragon.

1723
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:46,800
Imagine getting groomed by Fond de la bosom.

1724
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:49,800
That's the only girl I'd like groom me.

1725
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:55,800
Oh, sorry.

1726
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:57,800
Didn't see you there.

1727
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:01,800
Fond de la bosom and no one else.

1728
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,800
Only...

1729
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:10,800
Only Fond de la bosom is allowed to groom me.

1730
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:13,800
I guess you too.

1731
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:15,800
Abuse?

1732
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:17,800
Abuse these nights.

1733
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:28,800
Man, I wish I could get drunk more often, but I legitimately get so much trouble breathing.

1734
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,800
I don't know why.

1735
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:31,800
Is that normal?

1736
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:32,800
Does that happen to you too?

1737
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:33,800
I'm so sorry.

1738
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:35,800
It's a really hard time reading chat because I'm...

1739
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:37,800
I can't see.

1740
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:40,800
It doesn't happen to you.

1741
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:43,800
You don't get a hard time breathing when you're drunk.

1742
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:48,800
I literally feel like I'm going to pass out from like...

1743
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:52,800
Well, not right now, but when it gets really bad, I feel like I'm going to pass out from lack of oxygen.

1744
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:54,800
No, it's not normal.

1745
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,800
Wait, it's not normal?

1746
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:59,800
Wait, it's not normal?

1747
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,800
Dude, when it gets really bad, I'm literally like...

1748
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,800
Holy shit, I'm going to die.

1749
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:06,800
Like, I'm literally... I can't breathe.

1750
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:08,800
Be careful?

1751
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:09,800
Well, I'm okay now.

1752
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,800
I just... I'm just heavy breathing.

1753
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:14,800
But like, when it gets really bad, it's like really bad, you know?

1754
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:19,800
Wait, you might be slightly allergic?

1755
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,800
No way.

1756
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:25,800
I have passed out drunk before.

1757
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,800
Me too, I have too, but like...

1758
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:29,800
Well, not really.

1759
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:32,800
Passed out drunk means like you don't remember what happened, right?

1760
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,800
You should get an inhaler.

1761
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:35,800
Poster check.

1762
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:37,800
No, posture doesn't fix it.

1763
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,800
I'd like to be groomed by any.

1764
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,800
Turn me into your ideal big brother.

1765
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,800
Of course, Pookey.

1766
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:54,800
Of course, thank you for the five dollars.

1767
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:57,800
Oh shit, one of my toenails is coming off.

1768
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,800
Let me put it back on, I'm sorry.

1769
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:13,800
When someone consumes alcohol, the central nervous system is slowed down,

1770
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:16,800
which results in a slower breathing rate and depth of breathing.

1771
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,800
This is known as alcohol...

1772
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,800
Alcohol induced respiratory depression.

1773
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,800
It's normal, you're saying it's normal, right?

1774
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:29,800
You're saying it's normal, right?

1775
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,800
I can't be allergic to alcohol, you don't understand.

1776
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,800
I can't do it, that can't be happening right now.

1777
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:37,800
I won't let it happen.

1778
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:39,800
I can't be allergic to alcohol.

1779
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:41,800
It's not fair, it's not fair.

1780
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:45,800
Not fair, not fair, not fair, not fair, not fair, not fair, not fair.

1781
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:48,800
Passed out just means you passed out.

1782
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,800
Black dealt means you don't remember.

1783
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,800
Oh, black dealt means you don't remember.

1784
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:53,800
Okay.

1785
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:58,800
I will paint these toenails.

1786
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,800
I will do it.

1787
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:14,800
Plop, plop, plop, plop, get painted, get painted, get painted, get painted.

1788
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,800
It's fine, just get a pen, I don't have an api pen.

1789
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:25,800
It means real voice is her normal voice with 500 decibels.

1790
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:27,800
Do you mean like louder?

1791
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:29,800
Because that's not the case at all.

1792
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:31,800
It's not the case.

1793
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,800
That's not the case.

1794
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:40,800
Plop, plop, plop, plop, get painted, get painted, get painted with my comb.

1795
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:44,800
Also heavy breathing is hot.

1796
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:47,800
I spilled my alcohol a little bit.

1797
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:51,800
Fuck, is this hot to you?

1798
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,800
Oh fuck, I spilled my water too.

1799
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:17,800
You know how I lie down for a couple minutes before?

1800
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:18,800
A couple seconds.

1801
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:20,800
I'm gonna go do that again, okay?

1802
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:21,800
I'm just gonna lie down for a couple seconds.

1803
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:24,800
Just for a couple seconds please only, okay?

1804
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,800
I'll come to your house if you leave me.

1805
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:28,800
I don't have an api pen.

1806
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:31,800
Here's a cute one, I'm sorry.

1807
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:40,800

01:54:58,380 --> 01:55:00,380
Yeah.

1827
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:03,380
We die together.

1828
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:08,380
Let me just keep painting.

1829
01:55:08,380 --> 01:55:14,380
Oh here, I have one story to tell you, but it's not that fun, I'm sorry.

1830
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:20,380
When I was younger, um...

1831
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:24,380
Hey Sastilda, wake up, your brother is concerned.

1832
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:27,380
Don't worry, please don't be worried about me, please don't be worried.

1833
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:31,380
I promise you I'm okay, I promise you I'm fine.

1834
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:34,380
I love you.

1835
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:38,380
Don't worry, I'm okay.

1836
01:55:38,380 --> 01:55:41,380
Why are you concerned? There's nothing to be concerned about.

1837
01:55:41,380 --> 01:55:44,380
I always get really dramatic like this.

1838
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:49,380
Right, um, when I was younger, so my mom's divorced, right?

1839
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:52,380
I mean, our mom's divorced.

1840
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:54,380
Sorry to break it to you like this.

1841
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:55,380
I don't know if you know.

1842
01:55:55,380 --> 01:56:00,380
My mom's divorced, right? She has, um...

1843
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:04,380
She's had multiple boyfriends in the past,

1844
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:09,380
and one of her boyfriends had this daughter,

1845
01:56:09,380 --> 01:56:16,380
and her name was, let's call her Steve from Minecraft.

1846
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:20,380
So one of her boyfriends had this daughter called Steve from Minecraft,

1847
01:56:20,380 --> 01:56:24,380
and he, uh, his daughter was the same age as me, actually.

1848
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:28,380
So, you know, they were, we were kind of like expected to play together.

1849
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:30,380
What are you guys saying? Gay?

1850
01:56:30,380 --> 01:56:32,380
Why are you so gay?

1851
01:56:32,380 --> 01:56:35,380
I'm not a misstep, ten dollars. Love you, Emmy.

1852
01:56:35,380 --> 01:56:38,380
I love you too, thank you.

1853
01:56:38,380 --> 01:56:41,380
Right, he had this daughter called Steve from Minecraft,

1854
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:45,380
and because we were the same age, unfortunately,

1855
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:48,380
we were forced to play together a lot.

1856
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:53,380
The problem is that Steve from Minecraft had a really bad...

1857
01:56:53,380 --> 01:56:57,380
had a really bad problem with, um...

1858
01:56:57,380 --> 01:57:00,380
compulsive lying?

1859
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:04,380
She had a really bad problem with compulsive lying,

1860
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:08,380
and she would lie about, like, everything and anything,

1861
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:11,380
and because I was stupid little bitch and I still am,

1862
01:57:11,380 --> 01:57:14,380
I would believe her for every single lie.

1863
01:57:15,380 --> 01:57:16,380
She used to be like,

1864
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:20,380
Yeah, we got werewolves in the forest next to our house,

1865
01:57:20,380 --> 01:57:23,380
and then any time I would come over, I'd be like,

1866
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:25,380
Where are the werewolves?

1867
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:28,380
Are they gonna get us while we're sleeping?

1868
01:57:29,380 --> 01:57:31,380
Stupid, Emmy.

1869
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:33,380
Um...

1870
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:37,380
One time she locked me in her fucking bathroom and she was like,

1871
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:40,380
The werewolves are coming! The werewolves are coming!

1872
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:43,380
The werewolves are coming!

1873
01:57:43,380 --> 01:57:44,380
She was...

1874
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:47,380
She had a really bad problem with compulsive lying,

1875
01:57:47,380 --> 01:57:49,380
and I felt for every single one.

1876
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:51,380
But one time, right?

1877
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:55,380
My cousin did the same thing to me.

1878
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:56,380
Quite a moment.

1879
01:57:56,380 --> 01:57:59,380
But one time, um...

1880
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:02,380
I slept over at her house,

1881
01:58:02,380 --> 01:58:05,380
and, um...

1882
01:58:05,380 --> 01:58:09,380
I woke up, right, and she was like,

1883
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:12,380
I cut your hair,

1884
01:58:12,380 --> 01:58:14,380
and I looked this bitch in the face,

1885
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:15,380
and I was like,

1886
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:17,380
You fucking didn't.

1887
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:18,380
No, you didn't.

1888
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:21,380
I was so over all her lies,

1889
01:58:21,380 --> 01:58:23,380
and all her bullying,

1890
01:58:23,380 --> 01:58:24,380
and I was like,

1891
01:58:24,380 --> 01:58:25,380
Yeah, sure.

1892
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:27,380
Whatever!

1893
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:30,380
You didn't cut my hair.

1894
01:58:31,380 --> 01:58:32,380
And then she's like,

1895
01:58:32,380 --> 01:58:33,380
No really,

1896
01:58:33,380 --> 01:58:35,380
I cut your hair while you were sleeping.

1897
01:58:35,380 --> 01:58:37,380
And I looked at the pillow,

1898
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:39,380
and I saw like,

1899
01:58:39,380 --> 01:58:41,380
I need to drink more.

1900
