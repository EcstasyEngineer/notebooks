1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,920
Yo, man.

2
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:57,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

3
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:07,920
yeah, yeah, yeah

4
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,820
is

5
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:43,240
a

6
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,160
office

7
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,160
Hello?

8
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,160
Hello?

9
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,160
Can you hear me now?

10
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
Hello?

11
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Sorry.

12
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,160
I even...

13
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
I...

14
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
I...

15
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
I forgot to put chat, too.

16
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
Look at me, I'm a wizard!

17
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
Oh man, my hat's kind of fucked.

18
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
I'm a wizard.

19
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
I'm a wizard.

20
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
I'm a wizard.

21
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Oh man, my hat's kind of fucked.

22
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
It's alright.

23
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
I'm going to be looking towards the left, anyways.

24
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Look at me!

25
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
I'm so cute, I love this outfit.

26
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
I'm a wizard!

27
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
Okay, let me um...

28
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Let me fix chat.

29
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
I...

30
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
What the fuck is that?

31
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
I don't know why, every time I start streaming,

32
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
I get my...

33
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
a virtual camera on OBS starts,

34
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
and I don't even know what that means.

35
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
Um...

36
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
Sorry, one second!

37
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Let me put in chat.

38
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Oh, wrong button.

39
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Oh no, wait, no, that was the right button.

40
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Thank you for becoming a member, uh...

41
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Daniel?

42
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
Life chat?

43
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
Uh...

44
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
How do I pop out again?

45
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
Pop out.

46
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
There we go!

47
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
Hi!

48
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,160
Welcome to today's um...

49
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
Wizard101 stream!

50
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
How are you?

51
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
I'm eating.

52
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
Thank you for becoming a member,

53
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Crack.

54
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Hope you had fun at the beach.

55
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Can't believe you're 30 and a wizard.

56
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
30?

57
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
What do you mean 30? I'm not 30?

58
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
Something wrong?

59
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
I'm not 30, what do you mean 30?

60
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
Huh?

61
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Dirty 30? She doesn't know the lore?

62
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
Haglev?

63
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
What do you mean?

64
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
There's a saying that being 30

65
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
and a virgin makes you a wizard.

66
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Oh!

67
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
I've never heard of that saying!

68
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
I've never heard of it.

69
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
I've never heard of it.

70
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
I've never heard of it.

71
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
I've never heard of it.

72
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
I've never heard of it.

73
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
I've never heard of it.

74
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Oh! I've never heard of that saying!

75
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
I've never heard of that saying before.

76
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
What the fuck?

77
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Okay.

78
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
Um...

79
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
I'm eating um...

80
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
rice and pot stickers.

81
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,160
Now, before I um...

82
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Before I start the game,

83
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
we're supposed to make our schedules

84
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
for the next week on...

85
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
Oops.

86
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
Oh no, I don't remember my password.

87
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Why am I like this?

88
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
We're supposed to make our schedules

89
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
for next week on Wednesdays?

90
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
Like for the next week on Wednesdays?

91
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
Oh fuck, I don't remember my fucking password.

92
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
And I was gonna make the schedule with you.

93
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
If I remembered my password!

94
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
Um...

95
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
What?

96
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
Hold on, hold on.

97
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
I can get it, I can get it.

98
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Give me a second.

99
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Login is temporarily disabled

100
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
for this account because of numerous failed login attempts.

101
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Please try again in a minute.

102
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
I swear...

103
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
that I...

104
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
I don't know how to turn that up.

105
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,160
I swear I knew the password.

106
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
Damn it.

107
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
Okay, well I'll try again in a minute.

108
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
How have you been?

109
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
How have you been?

110
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
How have you been?

111
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
Do you mind if I eat loud?

112
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
I'm a loud chewer.

113
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
You didn't write stuff down?

114
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Are you gay?

115
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,160
Let me check in my notes if I wrote it down anywhere.

116
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
Thank you for the ten dollars, but...

117
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
I just went to the beach for two days.

118
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
If I didn't even tell you,

119
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
I went to the beach you wouldn't have known.

120
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Or was it...

121
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Did I say two dollars instead of ten?

122
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
Oh, I did write my password.

123
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
Oh!

124
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
I'm so smart.

125
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
I wrote down my password in my notes app.

126
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Okay, hold on, I got this.

127
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Okay.

128
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
Email or password is not valid!

129
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
But it's valid!

130
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Maybe I'll wait a little longer.

131
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
I'll wait a little longer.

132
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
How was the beach? Did you get a tan? No.

133
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Not really.

134
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
I wore sunscreen and then the second day,

135
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
they didn't really have...

136
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
They didn't really have that much sun.

137
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Like, the beach didn't have much sun the second day.

138
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Well, I don't like being tanned anyways,

139
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
so like...

140
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
I wouldn't have let myself get tanned.

141
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
It doesn't matter.

142
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
It doesn't matter.

143
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
I would not let myself get tanned.

144
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
But it was nice.

145
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
I had fun.

146
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Made a little sand castle.

147
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
The food was kind of shit though.

148
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
I'm not gonna lie.

149
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Like...

150
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,160
For some reason,

151
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,160
the days that I went to the beach

152
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,160
were the days that everything was closed.

153
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
Because it's like a tourist area.

154
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,160
So they're always open on like the weekends and shit.

155
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
But...

156
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
Not really on like Mondays and Tuesdays

157
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
and I was so fucking pissed because I couldn't go

158
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
to any places because they were all closed

159
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
on Mondays and Tuesdays.

160
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
So I couldn't really do much.

161
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,160
Okay, let's try this again.

162
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
I know, how dare they be fucking closed.

163
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
I locked in! Let's go!

164
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
Yes, please save that password.

165
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Okay, so...

166
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
We're gonna make my schedule for next week together.

167
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
And I guess you'll know my schedule right now.

168
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
You'll know my schedule right now.

169
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
So...

170
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
I'm able to stream on Mondays now

171
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
because

172
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
my piano lessons moved to a different day.

173
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
And a different time.

174
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,160
Seems like a weird business strategy.

175
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,160
Well, I guess just no one goes

176
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,160
at the start of the week.

177
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,160
You know?

178
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Do we get to pick some streams?

179
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Yeah, that's why I'm doing it with you.

180
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,160
There is one stream you don't get to pick though.

181
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
And that's the first one.

182
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,160
The second one is...

183
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
Is that the usual time?

184
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,160
I can't show you my screen

185
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
because then you'll see everyone else's schedules.

186
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
And...

187
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
Obviously, I don't want to show that

188
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,160
in case they don't want to show that.

189
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,160
But on Monday,

190
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,160
we're gonna play...

191
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Fuck, what's the game?

192
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,160
Let me look up the game, hold on.

193
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,160
Is it this?

194
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,160
On Monday, we're playing Chains Together

195
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
with a...

196
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
with a few fun, cute

197
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
girlies with Shibi.

198
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,160
Hold on, let me look up the names.

199
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
The full names of the rest.

200
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Because I need to put in the full names.

201
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Uh...

202
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
Um...

203
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
Utahime Mochizuki

204
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,160
from Special Light.

205
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
Um...

206
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,160
And...

207
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,160
One more girl from Special Light.

208
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Victoria Valerie

209
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
from Special Light.

210
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Now, this isn't completely concrete, but...

211
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
I think it's mostly concrete.

212
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
So, yeah.

213
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
We're playing Chains Together on Monday.

214
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
Now, the rest of the days, I...

215
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
don't know what to do.

216
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Yeah.

217
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
Hope you don't...

218
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
mauled too much. I don't think I will.

219
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
I don't think I will.

220
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Let's do Imi's homework.

221
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Um...

222
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
No, I still have piano lessons.

223
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
Not on that day, that's all.

224
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
That's all.

225
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
I got to see a little of Imi's Construction Company.

226
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Did you make it alone? I did.

227
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
I did make it alone.

228
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
ASMR the rest of the week.

229
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
I can't do ASMR all week.

230
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
I can do it one day of the week.

231
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Do you have membership?

232
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Um...

233
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
I would like to have a membership stream next week.

234
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
Okay, you want one ASMR?

235
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
Okay. Do you want it to be members only,

236
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
or do you want it to be public?

237
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,160
I don't know.

238
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
I kind of stay away from watch-alongs.

239
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
Just because I feel like

240
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
they're not that entertaining.

241
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Is that mean maybe?

242
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
If you have the membership on...

243
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
Oh!

244
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Wizard 101.

245
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
I don't.

246
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
But if we get paywalled,

247
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
then I might buy it. We'll see.

248
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
You sound sick.

249
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
I'm okay.

250
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
I'm just not always like...

251
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
super um...

252
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
hyper.

253
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
Sometimes I'm chill.

254
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Surprisingly, sometimes I'm chill.

255
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
We want watch-along?

256
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
I kind of hate watch-alongs.

257
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
You sound normal.

258
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Is this nipples?

259
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Oh! Yeah, I always sniffle.

260
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
I always sniffle. I'm a sniffly girl.

261
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
Minecraft would be fun, karaoke would be fun.

262
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
Members only for ASMR?

263
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
Alright, we'll do a member ASMR

264
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
on...

265
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
Wednesday then.

266
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Is that okay?

267
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Is that okay?

268
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
You shouldn't get paywalled this stream, to be honest.

269
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
I hope not.

270
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
After Triton Avenue?

271
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Everything passed that requires crowns or membership.

272
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
That's so shitty. I do remember getting paywalled

273
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
as a kid. I do remember that.

274
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
Okay, I'm gonna do...

275
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
I'm gonna do um...

276
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
ASMR stream

277
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
on Wednesday.

278
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
I never put

279
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
like what the...

280
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
um...

281
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
what the like...

282
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
um... theme of the ASMR

283
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
ASMR is because I actually don't know

284
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
until like the day of

285
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
or maybe like a little later.

286
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
You should do another karaoke.

287
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
I don't think I will yet.

288
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
I don't think I will yet.

289
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
I don't think I'm ready

290
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
for another karaoke

291
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
mentally.

292
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
I saw Minecraft though.

293
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Did you do the 30k stream yet?

294
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Wait, did I...

295
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Did I have some goal

296
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
for 30k stream?

297
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Well, thank you for the membership

298
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
fund.

299
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Membership is $5.

300
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
That's not too bad.

301
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
As a kid, it was bad though.

302
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
As a kid, it was bad.

303
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
Oh, apartment tour!

304
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Oh...

305
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
fit.

306
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
Okay.

307
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
You want that?

308
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
You really want that?

309
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Okay, sure. We can do an apartment tour here.

310
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
I'll put an apartment tour on Friday.

311
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
30k celebration stream

312
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
apartment

313
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
tour.

314
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
That's going to be on Friday

315
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
at the usual time.

316
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
And then I'd like to do...

317
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
I'd like to do one more on Sunday.

318
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
So...

319
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Um...

320
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
I guess since a lot of people

321
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
are liking Minecraft, we could do something in Minecraft.

322
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,160
I thought Brosly was Friday?

323
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
This is for next week.

324
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
This is for next week.

325
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
No.

326
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
This is for next week.

327
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Brosly isn't going to be every Friday.

328
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
It's just this Friday.

329
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Today's Wednesday, right?

330
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Am I going crazy?

331
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Piano playing?

332
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
You want a piano playing stream?

333
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Stop gaslighting me!

334
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
I know it's Wednesday!

335
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
Okay, well...

336
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,160
I'll do...

337
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Thank you for the $5.

338
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,160
I can look it up.

339
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
There was one game I wanted to play.

340
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,160
Oh my god, it looks exactly like Minecraft.

341
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,160
Wait, what the fuck?

342
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,160
It's just Minecraft.

343
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Wait, it just looks like a Minecraft

344
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,160
rip-off.

345
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Oh my god.

346
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
It does look cute though.

347
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,160
I'll put a pool.

348
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,160
I'll put a pool.

349
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,160
Also, thank you for 37k.

350
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Um...

351
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,160
That short kind of...

352
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
Excuse me.

353
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,160
That short kind of pushed me

354
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
to 37k.

355
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Oh, more of a mod that became its own thing.

356
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
Ah, I see.

357
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Okay, oops, that's not a cue.

358
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,160
Pull, pull, pull.

359
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,160
What do you want

360
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,160
for next week?

361
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Next week.

362
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Minecraft...

363
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
or piano streaming.

364
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
There.

365
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Little nightmares?

366
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
We could play little nightmares too, maybe.

367
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
I don't know.

368
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
What are you eating?

369
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
I'm eating pot stickers and rice.

370
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
So,

371
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
the vintage story was directly inspired

372
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
by Terraform Craft?

373
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,160
Eww...

374
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
I don't know what Terraform Craft is.

375
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
I'm guessing that's a mod in Minecraft.

376
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
I don't know what the goal for 40k is.

377
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,160
I don't know if I'll have a goal for 40k!

378
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:25,920
Okay, it seems like most people are saying, um, piano stream, so I'll make it a piano

379
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:45,680
stream then don't don't don't have high expectations okay I'm not Mozart I'm not

380
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:55,680
even Mozart's fart okay I'm truly like a beginner also it's not gonna be hand cam

381
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:03,280
it's just gonna be like the model and I probably won't take requests because unless

382
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:09,840
they're like super super simple then I might take requests I know we'll see okay

383
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:24,000
drunk IRL painting we already painted IRL I don't know I don't feel like that's like a

384
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,960
you know we already did that basically for fun it's okay to skip 40k and do something special

385
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:38,240
for 50k

386
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:48,080
how far you've come by like next year do you mean subs wise or piano wise

387
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,840
can you play hot cross buns I think I could isn't hot cross buns like super easy

388
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:04,960
I think that's like a beginner game right I'm not game but like bingy um song

389
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,880
I really need to turn that up before I forget also I have a fun fun not a fun story but like

390
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,200
an interesting story that I never really talked about I hope um live streamers

391
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,320
hold on I just want to turn up one of the notifications sounds real quick but I'll

392
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:42,960
tell you the story while I do it um except alerts is it alerts

393
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,520
oh thank you for the 20 gifted oh my god thank you thirdity

394
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:58,080
oh now I have to mute the alerts um I think it's the members that though that goes

395
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,720
yeah Pikmin sound effect I'm gonna make it louder there safe watch it like earblast you now

396
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:14,000
thank you for the 20 gifted yeah maybe I can play like twinkle twinkle little stars like something

397
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:23,840
easy like that yeah I can't give you like really big rewards for milestones because I still haven't

398
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:32,080
done the 10k milestone so I feel bad being like oh I'll do this huge thing for 50 or 40k because

399
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:39,200
it's like I haven't even finished the 10k milestone so yeah

400
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,400
you should really figure out how to remove those alerts at some point wait which alerts

401
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,560
like the one at a time thing I thought that was normal I thought that's just how it was is it

402
00:26:52,560 --> 00:27:00,160
not normal do other streamers not have like the one at a time alert for gifted memberships

403
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,800
what was for 10k it was um ducky art it was doc ducky art

404
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:21,120
oh there we go use microphone wait why is it my microphone

405
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,320
my microphone isn't connected to vtube studio for some reason

406
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,040
I was wondering why my mouth tracking was kind of off

407
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,160
hello okay there we go oh man

408
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:54,720
uh it doesn't recognize the microphone oh well you're gonna have kind of off mouth tracking

409
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:01,120
um other streamers typically just have one alert for x gifted 20 subs I don't know why they're

410
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:08,240
showing up one by one oh 50k was hex code was it was it actually

411
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,920

I used the vanishing potion yet so um what was I talking about right so

425
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,760
I don't know how deep I can go into this but I won't go too deep in it basically um

426
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,800
Uta DM'd me on Twitter right and when I saw her DM I like stalked her a little bit because

427
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,360
that's what I do like if if you DM me on Twitter I'm gonna stalk you um if you're a vtuber that is

428
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:10,560
right and I listened to her and I was like hmm her voice sounds familiar I feel like I've

429
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:20,000
heard that voice before right and so I did a little deep diving I did a little interrogating

430
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,640
from Uta and I found out that Uta was like okay I don't want to call her like an oh she because

431
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,200
I didn't really know what oh she's were back then but I watched Uta like

432
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:41,520
like years ago like years and years ago before I was even a vtuber before I really knew exactly

433
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,720
what vtubers were um I watched Uta like a long time ago and I was like holy crap

434
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,080
I kind of failed fan girl because I thought she was really cool

435
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:08,080
and now I get to collab with her

436
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,600
I get to collab with her now

437
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,080
I was like oh my god Uta I love your song cover

438
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,960

612
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:22,000

618
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:03,120
so much to ask but because I feel like these days I can't find games like that Zelda's kind of like

619
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:09,440
that but yeah like where's the whimsy exactly where is the whimsy in games these days everything is

620
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:17,760
so dark and depressing should I try final fantasy I remember looking at final fantasy and it still

621
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:33,680
looked really dark just saw one of your youtube shorts and saw your life hello you're super cute

622
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:42,240
thank you I'm surprised people came from shorts um I might I have a lot to say about that short

623
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,840
I'm sure other people have a lot to say about the short too but I'll talk about it first because

624
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:57,280
it's my short and I made it and it's kind of my fault but basically um so the comments on that

625
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:04,720
short that I'm getting on on Twitter it's been the most I haven't really checked the

626
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:10,000
comments on Twitter that much but I feel like on Twitter they've been the most respectful

627
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:19,760
but holy shit the comments I've gotten on tiktok and youtube shorts have been such a slap

628
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:30,560
to the face I've been just bombarded with the most backhanded compliments every single not every

629
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:35,360
single but like half the comments I have to just straight up delete or mute them from my channel

630
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:42,800
because they're the most backhanded rude compliments like everyone's like not everyone but like I've

631
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,920
gotten so many comments saying like why do vtubers even put on a voice like you sound like so annoying

632
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:53,040
with your high-pitched voice like why don't you just use your natural voice and it's so annoying

633
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:59,760
I've had to mute my comment section on tiktok because I I I just I couldn't do it anymore

634
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:08,160
and I know that I kind of it's kind of my fault because I um the way I kind of set up that the

635
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:15,280
short was very um it was kind of aimed more towards people who don't really know much about vtubers

636
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:23,440
you know I wanted to explain the the vtuber community to them I guess but I I don't know why

637
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:30,800
but tiktok just shows my content to people who dislike vtubers so yeah a lot of my comments are

638
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:36,720
just like why why do you talk like that like you're and I I'm happy that I'm receiving compliments

639
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:43,440
for my natural voice but it's also like you don't have to make the compliment backhanded you know

640
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:51,440
and I usually like tiktok I've actually never received hate on tiktok up until um very recently

641
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:58,320
like I always got basically nothing but support even with this voice even posting with this voice

642
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:08,320
I I've never received hate for it up until recently so I was just really confused um yeah there's no

643
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:14,160
reason to insult like it's fine if you like my natural voice but you don't have to shit on this

644
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:19,120
one you can just say oh wow your your natural voice is so hot like I've got a lot of comments

645
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:24,560
like that too and I really appreciate them but a lot of them are like wow your natural voice is so

646
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:36,960
hot and your cute voice is so annoying and it's like oh thanks I guess I just wanted to rant about

647
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:45,680
because it's been like on my mind um this whole time call me a fool so I had all but forgotten yeah

648
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:53,360
algorithm cum is drunk again and sending your shorts to aunties on tiktok kind of on tiktok yeah

649
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:02,160
a little bit yeah I'm trying to educate the normies but I think I think because I'm a loli

650
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:09,280
they kind of hate me so anytime they see me they kind of just use my short to hate on youtubers

651
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:19,920
in general so yeah but I'm happy that the people that watch me are supportive because I got a lot

652
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,720
of comments saying like oh if you talked in a natural voice I would actually watch your streams

653
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,680
and then I would check their profile and they're not even following me and it's like

654
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:36,080
no you wouldn't why should I change for you you you're not following me you're not watching me

655
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:45,760
like yeah I got a lot of comments like that a lot and that really annoyed me too um but yeah sorry for the

656
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:55,680
rant um sorry for the read but I just wanted to know about it you're in trouble quickly use the

657
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:00,880
you I haven't even been able to do this cast it on yourself it will replenish I'd watch you

658
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,920
regardless of which voice you use thank you see that's what I really appreciate me I have comments

659
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:11,040
like that too like oh both are nice and that's that's what I appreciate the most um

660
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:19,200
yeah you being a lolly weeds up all the anties and you want to end up getting hate later done the

661
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:29,680
line from fans it does weed them out but they're still like commenting on my stuff about it like

662
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:39,760
yeah they don't watch my streams of course but they're like gross and I don't think they let you die

663
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:46,480
in this do they I never understood hate comments like if you don't agree or like something just

664
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:53,200
don't watch it it's not necessarily hate most of it is just backhanded compliments that's most of it

665
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,200
and also a lot of comparisons to uh

666
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:14,640
is this stuffy is that hurting I forgot quickly now pick another spell and cast it at one of them

667
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,800
it's not the right

668
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,760
hate is still hate is still hate now they don't really die good

669
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:35,360

I'm not gonna shit on any lollies with big boobs but I um same thing with chibi characters

683
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:23,200

684
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,200
and that's what matters

685

689
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:03,520
seen some crazy top heavy ones which is fine like do whatever you want um but I wouldn't personally

690
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:08,960
design a character like that because it's like you know what I like I like them flat the point

691
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,160
is that they're flat you know

692
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:23,440
look at me dancing I won you look a bit the worst for where I am the worst for where at all

here asked for an adult then she comes over and spoke in the delivery guy was thrown through a loop

707
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:13,200
what shondo's natural voice sounds like a loli which has been jarring for people who interact with her

708
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,200
like she told the story of how anise of hers or something answered the door for a package

709
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,040
they asked for an adult and then she comes over and spoke with the delivery guy was thrown through a

710
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:26,880
loop oh I don't know what shondo naturally sounds like I've never heard of it

711
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:37,600
um but I'm not I'm not a big shondo watcher but I now I understand why a lot of female

712
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:42,880
vtubers aren't honest about voice acting now I understand why they're not honest about it

713
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:50,320
I never got hate for it before but now I do and it's like damn maybe I shouldn't have been honest

714
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,760
I try to be honest though

715
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:02,080
I tried to be honest um but now I understand why some people aren't honest

716
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:14,160
you get shit on it for it shit on it for it shitted on them yeah I just shitted on them

717
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,480

718
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,120

new to vtuber content can you explain why vtubers need to join these groups like veeler um

723
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,760
thank you for the don't know um

724
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:12,240
um so they don't need to um there's vtuber groups which are usually just friend groups that they

725
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:17,520
you know have a name for their friend group and they just call it a vtuber group um

726
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:26,560
but then there's also uh vtuber like agencies um and

727
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:31,680
you don't need to join it oh what the fuck

728
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:40,480
oh there we go there we go you don't need to join one but you can if you want to

729
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:47,760
that's all there's a lot of indie people that aren't part of agencies it's just up to you

730
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:54,400
if you want to audition for one um some of them provide perks some of them claim to provide perks

731
01:06:54,400 --> 01:07:05,120
and then they don't um so so watch out because um not all of them are good wink wink wink

732
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:14,080
i'm not talking about veeler um um everyone has different reasons for joining an agency so

733
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:21,440
it's really some of them are like oh i want a bigger audience so i'm going to join an agency

734
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:28,000
to try to get a bigger audience um some people are like oh i have no money and maybe an agency

01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,520
i didn't fart

836
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:20,080
we do need an adult wizard 101 i feel like no kids are playing wizard 101 anymore

837
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:28,080
like kids like new kids aren't playing this new kids are playing like fortnite or something you

838
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:35,520
know shower stream i don't think i can ever do a shower stream just because i i i don't have the

839
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:43,440
facet facet i don't have the facilities to um move my setup to my shower you know

840
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:49,120
i don't even have the facility to like move my setup to my kitchen like i can't

841
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:57,600
i don't have a laptop that can like stream i'm quite impressed um i don't have a laptop that

842
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:05,920
can stream so i i can't move anything before streaming yeah i think it's just the old players

843
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:10,640
my sister used to play it 10 years ago and still does now wow what a coincidence i'm your sister

844
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:14,560
and i used to play this 10 years ago too

845
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:25,360
throw an idea no i don't need a laptop it's okay

846
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:34,320
skeletal pirates would be good to know exactly what we're up against do you think you could

847
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:40,080
battle a few skeletal pirates to see how tough they are of course i can what laptop are you using

848
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:49,360
um thank you so much for doing this the laptop i used during school was an hp omen

849
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,120
i got it when i was in like

850
01:20:55,440 --> 01:21:05,600
maybe like ninth grade and i used it all during college um and to this day i regret getting a

851
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:11,040
gaming laptop i don't know what the fuck was going through my head but that's the gaming laptop

852
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:16,320
i used to stream so maybe you know maybe it was a good thing because i probably wouldn't have been

853
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:25,440
able to stream with like a regular laptop so um but i can't i can't use it to stream anymore

854
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:32,720
it's kind of um it's kind of run its course it's a little too junky to stream nowadays

855
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:41,120
it's it i wouldn't be able to do much with it you know hp for games it was a gaming laptop it was

856
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:46,640
it was specifically advertised as a gaming laptop loving the fit thank you why do you

857
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:54,000
guys hate hp so much i'm a fan how much did you pay for it we don't talk about that we we don't

858
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:00,960
talk about that i paid more for the laptop than i did for this pc let's just say that

859
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,920
then you could take us to the beach i don't think the hotel wi-fi is good enough to stream

860
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:20,880
that's why i'm using a fan all hp products are trash well i didn't know that when i was in ninth

01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:54,400
are always cold are kind of they get on my nerves sometimes like my mom and my cousin are two people

894
01:26:54,400 --> 01:27:00,080
that are always cold and they're always complaining about it and it's like damn bitch like we get it

you're skinny like i don't i don't know what to tell you like go get it go get a sweater like stop

896
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:10,000
complaining like it's literally fine everyone else here everyone else around you is fine like

897
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:16,000
okay sorry that's a really big pet peeve of mine it was really annoying with my cousin because

898
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:23,760
it's like dude it's like 32 degrees outside okay um everyone around you is wearing shorts

899
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:29,120
of course there's gonna have there's gonna be air conditioning in every building we enter because

900
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:36,320
it's hot as balls outside okay so um wear long pants and bring a sweater because i don't

901
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:40,160
know what else you expected when it's so hot outside of course every building is gonna be

902
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:44,960
air conditioned um but yeah that was a really big pet peeve of mine when i was hanging out with my

903
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:55,040
cousin like everyone else is okay just just stop complaining and and like accommodate for yourself

904
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:59,520
instead of complaining to me because what do you want me to do about it i can't do anything do you

905
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,520
want me to take my pants off and give them to you sorry i'm like really annoyed by this

906
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:14,800
32 celsius 32 celsius is that not hot i don't know my room is very hot too right now

907
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:26,640
oh sorry almost almost even a true ice queen knows when to let the ice melt what does that mean

908
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,560
cold personality or physically physically like people who are always cold physically and do

909
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:36,640
nothing but complain about it because that's what my cousin does at least my mom usually

910
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:40,880
brings a sweater and she tells me to bring a sweater even though i'm always fine who the

911
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:48,080
fuck is this morning or death bringer get out of my fight dude get out of my fight

912
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:56,960
i suck at computer building too it took me days for my first one i i i debated on making my own

913
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:04,080
i really did um i added all the parts to like uh i added all the parts to my um

914
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:13,600
um you know my shopping list and i was waiting to um save up enough money for all the parts it

915
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:20,480
was going to be like 1.6k right and so i was like cool i have all the parts in my shopping cart

916
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:25,840
so now i just need to save up enough money and then when i finally had enough money do you know

917
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:30,000
how much it costed do you know how much the price went up in a couple of months it went up to 2k

918
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:37,520
in a couple of months and i was like what am i supposed to do now what what am i supposed to

919
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:44,560
do now i i can't buy the parts anymore because it went up so so much um so i just bought a pre-built

920
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:55,280
one because it's like well i'm not gonna save up more i can't so yeah um it's the opposite it's

921
01:29:55,280 --> 01:30:00,640
always too hot everywhere for me i'm usually fine everywhere i go i'm never really too hot or too

922
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:05,200
cold unless i'm outside of course because then i'm exposed to the elements but in buildings

923
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:10,320
i'm always fine um and i can always accommodate for myself like a normal person instead of

924
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:18,720
complaining all the time in asia walking around in 30-ish weather for five minutes and your shirt

925
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:26,080
yeah i'm sure it is and a lot of um like

926
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,960
southeast asian countries where it's like really humid

927
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:37,120
i'm always coldnessers and stuff but i just wear layers that's what i'm saying like just just wear

928
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:47,600
layers like even even if it's um because it was it was um it was summer when we were walking around

929
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:57,040
but like bring a sweater with you you know like if you're gonna complain about being cold in

930
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:04,000
every single building we go in just bring a sweater it's not that hard why is canadian

931
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,280
prices so crazy i don't know i don't know

932
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:20,080
um yes i'm not paying attention to her i'm just ranting

933
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:27,120
you can always just layer more clothes but you can only get so naked you know that's true

934
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:35,920
that's true pc building isn't that hard but the money involved making it intimidating scary to

935
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:42,880
put it together and not turn on for xyz reasons yeah it can be very very stressful especially

936
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:46,000
if you don't know what you're doing i'm sure you know the people who know what they're doing

937
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:50,720
are fine recommending you to build one because they know what they're doing and they're not afraid

938
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:55,600
of making mistakes but like i don't know what i'm doing what if i break apart that costed a lot of

939
01:31:55,600 --> 01:32:02,240
money which is very very realistic for me to do it's very realistic for me to break apart that

940
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:06,720
costs a lot of money because i don't know what i'm doing and sure i could watch tutorials but at

941
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:15,120
the end of the day i'm i still don't know what i'm doing something always goes wrong with the

942
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:22,160
build yeah help something went wrong with my pre-built i don't have bluetooth with this computer

943
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,840
like i have the option for bluetooth and the bluetooth

944
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:33,600
technically works but does it actually work in practice not really like sure sure bluetooth

945
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:40,640
connects and sure i can kind of use it but it does it constantly disconnect and um constantly

946
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:44,400
like cut out yeah and i don't know why

947
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,120
so i can't imagine the problems i would have with a computer i built myself

948
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:56,240
you could practice on the computer you already have taking it apart and putting it

949
01:32:56,240 --> 01:33:02,960
bro i'm not trying to break my pc i don't want to break this one i like this one i don't want to

950
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:12,880
break it more oh i'm supposed to kill these fairies come here come here let me fight you hello guys

951
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:17,920
guys there we go

952
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:23,920
it's the same with cars it's cost less to buy the parts and assemble it yourself than

953
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:28,720
buy a pre-built car but the ready to go car is more user friendly for non-mechanics exactly

954
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:36,480
exactly obviously maybe that's a little bit like um that comparison is a little bit

955
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:40,160
steep i don't know but

956
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:46,160
like there's a lot of learning that goes into it and it's like

957
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:57,440
i'd rather just spend more money at that point i got shit to do like playing wizards 101 you know

958
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:03,760
would you rather me not stream and try to build my own computer or would you rather me

959
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:08,640
just spend extra money and play wizards 101 with you because i'd rather play wizards 101

960
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:15,680
you should totally play more games you played as a child i love experiencing nostalgia

961
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:24,000
um i can i can whip out the emulator and fucking play mario i didn't really play that many games

962
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:30,320
as a child actually so this one i only played because my cousin introduced it to me

963
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:38,880
but like even then i didn't play this one too often because i had a poopoo laptop

964
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:41,520
that could barely handle playing this game

965
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:50,080
i have to pee how many micro transactions has wizards 101 given you yet not any yet but i

966
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:55,200
know i'll hit it eventually because i think this is a it's not a play-to-win game i mean pay-to-win

967
01:34:55,200 --> 01:35:06,480
game but it's a kind of a pay-to-play game um i think i'm gonna go pee after this game

968
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:14,320
i'd love to see you play older games though yeah i don't know what older games i did play

969
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:24,000
maybe i can there is one game that i really is this turn based yes it is turn based

970
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:30,160
um okay hold on i'm gonna go pee pee

971
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:46,000
uh table cloud has been lifted okay hold on um i hope i don't get attacked be right back

972
01:35:55,200 --> 01:36:16,000
so

973
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:34,560
um there's the game hi why don't you let me pee with you because I'm

974
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:41,520
embarrassed I don't want you to pee with me sorry sometimes I get a little stuck

975
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:47,160
and I go on my phone I just scrolled through my phone a little bit

976
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:57,480
okay um oh I think I turned off my audio okay there we go turned off the music

977
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:04,960
okay hello

978
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:16,160

shorts have me in a grip hold sometimes wait what are we talking about what were

1016
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:15,160
yeah so I don't know if I can use an emulator I'm guessing I can't

1017
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:27,000
let's Ellen someone modded them and and they're close to skyrim if you want to

1018

1019
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,000
what why would I do it on brosley

1020
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:48,680
the rattle in the darkness okay hold on one second

1021
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:52,200
to the underworld for his crimes if I focus

1022
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:56,200
perhaps I can sense his location

1023
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:08,120
oh it's not safe for youtube I don't really know if I would like a game like

1024
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:14,280
Skyrim though Tara was really popular with vtubers early on I had no clue

1025
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:17,880
when I when I was playing terror I didn't know what vtubers were

1026
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:21,960
so yeah

1027
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:28,440
oh I got a bro now I know kersh and peepa played it

1028
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:32,600
oh the emulator would cause it to start it would get stuck at finding a

1029
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:35,960
server oh okay okay

1030
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:41,080
well then I can't play it on an emulator

1031
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:48,120
were vtubers even a thing back then of course they were of course they were

1032
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:52,520
press speed to equip the mount okay

1033
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:58,280
did you play perfect world no I don't know that

1034
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:01,240
Skyrim is amazing the magic kind of sucks but with mods it's a lot better

1035
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:04,840
here's the thing about Skyrim it's not whimsical and pretty Skyrim is

1036
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:09,480
ugly I need my games to be whimsical

1037
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:15,000
and beautiful like nice cute sceneries and Tara had that Tara had really really

1038
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,440
pretty like environments Tara was a really

1039
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:23,240
really pretty game but Skyrim is ugly

1040
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:27,000
I'm sorry I'm sure it's a really fun game but like

1041
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:31,080
it's just not for me I don't want to feel depressed and and sad with all these

1042
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:34,680
sad depressing colors you know she be

1043
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:40,680
hi she be hello monkey wizard raid what

1044
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:49,080
hello hello welcome thank you for raiding she be

1045
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:52,280
if the elves aren't sexy it's not a good it's not good fancy

1046
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:56,360
scary melts look like melted crayon people

1047
01:48:56,360 --> 01:49:02,040
I don't particularly care about sexy characters I just want it to be

1048
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:07,160
like cute you know like I would play this game if the characters didn't look

1049
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:10,120
like shit I mean honestly I would play this

1050
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:16,040
game anyways um if it wasn't for kids

1051
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:20,600
literally your character in game oh gee so cute I know I know

1052
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:24,520
I know so adorable

1053
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:31,160
Skyrim is ugly that's why my game is unrecognizable from the original

1054
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:34,600
oh I'm guessing you can install like a shit ton of mods right

1055
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:38,760
is that the case

1056
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:47,000
uh I don't want to fight these guys I don't really like fighting

1057
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,760
I'm also kind of bad at it but

1058
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:59,640
hmm where do I go serene serene nightchant okay

1059
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:04,280
the mods make Bethesda game playable I don't even know if my pc would be able

1060
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:08,440
to handle mods I don't know how strong it is to be

1061
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:15,880
honest okay can you use the broom oh

1062
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:27,000
wait which button was for the broom again

1063
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:43,880
go to your inventory and activate it

1064
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:49,880
um Enchanted broom one day boo

1065
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:56,680
boo fuck that that's so annoying this game did that a lot I remember it would

1066
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:00,680
give you stuff for like one or two days or like a week

1067
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:03,800
if you have a 1080 or higher GPU you can basically run Skyrim with as many

1068
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:08,120
mods as you want that aren't high fidelity super realism graphics

1069
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:11,160
I don't know what I have

1070
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:16,680
I don't know what I have I'm gonna be real

1071
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:21,320
oh this is the dude X

1072
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:26,040
I hate rental items and games me too just give it to me man

1073
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:31,080
it's a broom I'm a wizard or a witch whatever you want to call it like just

1074
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:35,720
give it to me is it really gonna kill you to give me one

1075
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:41,960
mount as a starting player apparently

1076
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:45,960
you can buy a permanent one later on

1077
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:51,160
why why do I need to purchase it it's a broom just give me one mount

1078
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:57,800
one free mount is it really gonna kill you wizard 101 team

1079
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:04,440
I hate that in MMM RPGs I hate it too and you know what Tara was really good

1080
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:08,360
about not doing this shit from what I remember

1081
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:12,280
and that's another reason why I liked it because I remember getting really cool

1082
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:17,000
mounts for events and they would stay

1083
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,960
stay with me from what I remember

1084
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:24,840
do you remember the story about the recalled Harry Potter broom toy apparently

1085
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:28,600
vibrated with a lot of and a lot of little girls

1086
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:34,680
no I I was not actually a Harry Potter fan

1087
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:42,680
um I never read Harry Potter um I know a lot of people did though

1088
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:50,600
I never read a lot of popular um media or watched a lot of popular media either

1089
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:53,800
they're good about it in Final Fantasy 14 too

1090
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:57,000
that's good maybe I should try it I don't know I've had people tell me to try

1091
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,200
Final Fantasy but when I looked at it I was like

1092
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:03,880
this is still kind of an ugly game

1093
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:11,400
um they recalled the first shipments because parents complain

1094
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:16,760
I can see why they would my throw

1095
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:24,280
do I have to fight these guys

1096
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:29,800
break it got a lot better with don trawl now don trawl now graphics up to you

1097
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:34,360
know maybe I should I don't know

1098
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:40,840
if you want the game to look good it can't be an MMO why why

1099
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:45,160
why is that too much to ask for should I just make my own pretty MMO

1100
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:49,400
should is that what I should do do I have to do it myself at this point

1101
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:55,000
oops we only do attack attack spells here

1102
01:53:57,480 --> 01:54:03,160
depends on the Final Fantasy game oh well give me the prettiest one

1103
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:13,000
the VLR MMO the VLR MMO now with sex options for every character

1104
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:20,360

1107
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:34,840

1108
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:40,200
am I gonna die

1109
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:47,240
should I use here I'll use a I don't know what that does

1110
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:51,960

1136
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:30,760
kitchen the porch okay that's okay those are acceptable I guess

1137
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:36,200
so cute may I recommend a very obscure game that I played a lot of times I

1138
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:42,040
guess if you want I'm the likelihood of me playing it is

1139
01:57:42,040 --> 01:57:46,600
low but if you want to recommend it

1140
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:50,280
but notice that the dark magic that was previously jokling this

1141
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:55,880
story seems to have abated why do they use big words like abated in this game
