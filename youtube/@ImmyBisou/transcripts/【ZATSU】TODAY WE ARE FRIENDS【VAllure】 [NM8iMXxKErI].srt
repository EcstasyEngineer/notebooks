00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800

Yeah.

6
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:46,160
Oh.

7
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Hello.

8
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Hello.

9
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
Hello.

10
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
Hello everyone.

11
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,160
Turn you guys down a bit.

12
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
My beautiful girls.

13
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,160
Yeah.

14
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Can you hear everyone good?

15
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Hello chat.

16
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Hello.

17
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Hello.

18
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
Hi.

19
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
Hello.

20
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Hi.

21
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,400
So, uh, change of plans.

22
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Everything broke.

23
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Yay.

24
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Everything broke.

25
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Absolutely.

26
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Everything broke.

27
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,400
And so now we're, we're doing a zatsu.

28
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Woo.

29
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Woo.

30
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Woo.

31
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,280
Because then we tried to do a jack box and that wasn't working out and then, yeah, Uno

32
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,920
didn't want to fucking behave.

33
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
So we're here.

34
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
We're just going to chat.

35
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,920
Uh, we might do some like Q and A and then maybe do some like would you rather questions

36
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,120
or like will you press the button questions or just maybe we'll just tell each other really

37
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:46,480
bad pickup lines or try to raise each other up.

38
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,920
We spent like, what was it, like that first hour, hour trying to make this work.

39
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,400
And I'm so sorry everyone that it didn't work out.

40
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,960
Literally Ubisoft said you don't own Uno and I said, what do you mean?

41
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
It's right here.

42
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Yeah.

43
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,920
I purchased it and did like family sharing from our other accounts and then to let me

44
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,840
had to buy it on our normal accounts and that still didn't work.

45
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,840
Well, it only worked for me and Emmy and Azura and then it just wouldn't open and then it

46
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,840
just nothing was working.

47
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
It was so dumb.

48
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
It was, it was not working.

49
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,640
You pressed play and it just closed it out again.

50
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
Yeah.

51
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,520
And I would literally just crash.

52
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
So I hate Ubisoft.

53
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
We all hate Ubisoft.

54
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
We all hate Ubisoft.

55
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
We all hate Ubisoft.

56
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
We all hate Ubisoft in this house.

57
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,520
That's why my, I thought it was annoying.

58
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
We paid twice.

59
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
We paid twice.

60
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
And it still didn't work.

61
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
Yeah.

62
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
They're just trying to steal our money.

63
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
I can't wait to refund every game title from us.

64
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
We paid twice.

65
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
We paid twice.

66
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
We paid twice.

67
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
And it still didn't work.

68
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
Yeah.

69
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
They're just trying to steal our money.

70
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,200
I can't wait to refund every game title from them.

71
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Sending the CEO a personalized letter.

72
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
I'm sending the CEO a seasoned assist.

73
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,200
It doesn't make any sense, but I'm doing it.

74
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,400
Um, but yeah, if you guys have questions for us, let's do, we'll do a couple of, would

75
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,920
you, uh, will you press the button questions and then you guys can come up with questions

76
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and post them in our respective chats.

77
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,800
Um, and then maybe we'll read like one from each of our chats.

78
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
The questions are going to be like, did you guys have sex in real life yet?

79
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,800
When are you going to have sex in real life?

80
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Not yet.

81
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Soon.

82
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Very soon.

83
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Um, but yeah, that'll give you some time to think of questions to ask us.

84
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Uh, let's see, let me find a good will you.

85
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,680
Should, I'm wondering if I should do this one.

86
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Um, I don't think we want to be based right off the bat.

87
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
I do.

88
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,680
I'm going to send you guys a screenshot of the question it just asked.

89
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
I'm dying.

90
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
Oh God.

91
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
Here you go.

92
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
What, what is the screenshot?

93
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,680
It's in general.

94
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Oh shit.

95
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,560
I'm not American.

96
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,560
I don't care.

97
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,560
Maybe not that one.

98
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Maybe not that one.

99
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
I'm not American, but.

100
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Some Americans might get triggered.

101
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,560
A lot of people said no to that question.

102
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,560
They wouldn't press the button, which is funny.

103
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,560
Um, this one doesn't make any sense.

104
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
What though?

105
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,440
You will become an extremely attractive girl, but no guys will find you attractive.

106
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,440
That doesn't make any sense.

107
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
What?

108
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Makes sense.

109
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,440
I would be extremely attractive.

110
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
I'm already an extremely attractive girl.

111
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
What's there to lose?

112
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
Oh, okay.

113
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Here you go.

114
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Would you, will you press the button?

115
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,440
If you could change the weather at will or the, but the weather you choose is last for

116
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
a month.

117
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Oh, I will not press the button.

118
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,440
I think I just like rain a lot and I don't want it to rain for a month though.

119
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Oh, I do.

120
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
Yeah.

121
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
I don't know.

122
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
I don't know.

123
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
I don't know.

124
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
I don't know.

125
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,440
I don't know.

126
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
I don't know.

127
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,440
I don't know.

128
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
I don't know.

129
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
I don't know.

130
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
I don't know.

131
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
I don't know.

132
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,440
I just like a lot and I don't want it to rain for a month, though.

133
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Oh, I do.

134
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Yeah, uh, you would?

135
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
I do want it to rain a month.

136
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
I thought, I thought I would be emo.

137
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
I thought you meant, I thought you meant like season.

138
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
I'm sour.

139
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:05,720
to be sunny you know no I want it I want the opposite now I mean I got a

140
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,160
basement so and all the senpais are there they'll all drown if like there's

141
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,360
too much rain but a month is so long yeah yeah you could have given fly the

142
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,880
pens the people are okay here's the next one you can revive and keep love

143
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:40,400
ones from dying but every time you use your powers 50,000 I feel like I'm

144
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:49,720
conflicted because I would just kill a senpai if I even suspect anything but

145
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:56,600
me who can already do that yeah but usually Emmys powers come with a sort of

146
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:03,560
twist no humans need to die no one needs to die everyone live I'm killing 50,000

147
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,520
people to bring back who to die though like 50,000 you want to use 50,000

148
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:26,400
people specifically like by name anyways oh that one was almost split

149
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:37,560
people put 45% and 55% said no great ethno cleansing from mercy over here

150
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:53,280
I'm joshing around I'm not joshing where you say is there what what should I

151
00:12:53,280 --> 00:13:01,080
should we all do the poem do you know what where is this bowl oh I'm just

152
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:08,240
reading off the questions from the website you receive a diary that tells

153
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,400
you everything that happens in the future but you'll participate in a game where you have to be

154
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,880
hunted down by other diary users that can also see the future. Ooh that sounds like an anime.

155
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:29,600
Yeah right. Is it a anime? It should be. It should be. Is it a math book? Future diary? Yeah isn't it a

156
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,520
mirror anime game? Oh wait yeah that's wait that's fucking true actually.

157
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,480
I'm like why does it sound so familiar? I would do it. I would do it. It sounds fun.

158
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,720
And plus you have a diary and I would win. Yeah that's true. I feel like would you be

159
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,240
clever enough to outwit other diary users though? I mean outwit. We just killed them.

160
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,360
But they're gonna try to kill you too. They also have the diary. Yeah but I'll kill them first.

161
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,880
Okay. I'm not if I kill them first. I don't I think I would die so I won't I won't kill them.

162
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:18,560
You find five dollars but you give it back to the person who dropped it. What the fuck? No. No.

163
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,640
It's a five dollars is mine. Yeah. Yeah what the fuck. No maybe maybe I want to feel good for that

164
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,680
day and be like yeah I did something nice. You feel good by stealing five dollars.

165
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:39,120
Yeah exactly. Five finger discount. Get five dollars. Well mine if I do. Yeah. I wish I could

166
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,560
make a messy spot. I probably do it though. I mean like that's something I just do normal.

167
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,640
Okay stop being a good person. Yeah what does it look? I mean I'm a terrible person. So awful. I

168
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:59,360
think babies are gross and babies are gross and old ladies. I don't know if I can ask this word.

169
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,720
Ask it. Ask it. Ask it. You have the house of your dreams furniture etc all included

170
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:14,720
but it's in Somalia. What's wrong with Somalia? It's well specifically it's in

171
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:23,600
Mogadishu Somalia which is not a safe place. Oh I don't know anything about that place.

172
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:32,880
Okay ignore that one. I'll skip it. Yeah we'll skip that one. Pirates? Yeah sure.

173
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,640
Wow there's a lot of murderous questions. You save 10,000 people around the world

174
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:49,520
but you have to drown a person with your bare hands. Easy. Easy peasy. Yeah easy peasy. You've

175
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:55,440
already done that before. I'll just choose a senpai. Easy. Yeah someone that's a willing sacrifice.

176
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,360
Yeah yeah just easy. Oh this is well I mean it's not that hard to like sacrifice someone but I mean

177
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,480
yeah maybe yeah. Easy peasy. Why does everybody why is all these questions have to do with death?

178
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:14,240
What is this? This one has to do with the f***ing FIFA World Cup so I'm skipping it.

179
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,160
I don't know anything about FIFA. I'm sorry senpai. I'm sorry

180
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,120
pin pals. I'm sorry harems. I'm sorry bleeding hearts. I don't know anything about FIFA.

181
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,520
Me neither it's okay. You can listen to any song with perfect quality in your head at any time

182
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,480
but you must listen to a 30 second ad after each song. No. This is just Spotify.

183
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,440
Music. Except in your head. This is Spotify. This is the future. This is the Neuralink.

184
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,640
Yeah I was gonna say I'm like this is what you don't muskies trying to do. That's what he wants.

185
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:58,720
No. I would not. I wouldn't either. I wouldn't probably also because I don't really listen to music.

186
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:07,360
This is the most annoying thing. Yeah especially it's like that really like annoying ad voice like

187
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:15,600
try lexa pro. You don't want to break from the ads? Oh my favorite hatred of ads is like I

188
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,720
I can't believe I'm playing this game. Oh my gosh. And it's like a really big tiddied woman walking

189
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,080
in a line. Well man sacked on top of her or something.

190
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:35,040
Wait I think that one too the like giant one right? Yeah. I was like AO. Can you like slap

191
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,560
his head on this? How long was the ad? It was like 30 seconds. Yeah like 30 seconds.

192
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:49,680
This is a good one. You become a very famous celebrity but you cannot see your family or

193
00:17:49,680 --> 00:18:00,240
loved ones often. Once a year for a few days Mac. Right button press button. Press press.

194
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,880
Press button press press press press press press. Yeah they're slapping.

195
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,160
I wasn't really sad without my parents I would be really sad without my mom.

196
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:27,760
I love my parents like I also love Amy's mom and Mercy's parents would be very hard

197
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,760
for me.

198
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:35,480
Yeah, like I love them very much and that's why if I'm moving I want to move close to

199
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:46,040
them close I don't maybe I'll stay close by but she's like I'm going across the world

200
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,040
I wouldn't care.

201
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,640
I know a lot of people don't have good relationships with their parents I mean like yeah it's not

202
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,960
a terrible relationship it's not like massively terrible it's just I don't understand what

203
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
you mean.

204
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,080
Moving with them can be hard.

205
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:09,160
You pay with your soul instead of with a rent.

206
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:15,320
Any person of your choosing will want to have sex with you but you will die in five years.

207
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,320
I'm not pressing the button this is already my reality.

208
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Fun!

209
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,400
Like the person of my dreams are my step-punch.

210
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:30,200
I know yeah I love my hair I love entertaining my hair I don't want to die so no thank you.

211
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,480
I love my hair's face.

212
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,920
A lot of people said no to that.

213
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,000
You will never experience this is a good one for Amy.

214
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,200
You will never experience difficulty going to the bathroom again but you will never

215
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,640
remember whether you flushed or not.

216
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,040
This already happens to me!

217
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,840
Sure I'll press the button I already don't remember if I flushed.

218
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,200
Yeah I'd press it too.

219
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,560
Oh my gosh.

220
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,400
It's like muscle memory to flush no?

221
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah so who cares?

222
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,800
And then you're just hoping because what if you forgot that one time.

223
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:17,120
You're buying as long as you're not over at a friend's house.

224
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,640
So are you guys pressing the button?

225
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,640
Yes.

226
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:27,200
You don't have to press the button I'm already regular.

227
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,600
Mercy doesn't suffer with constipation like the rest of us.

228
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,800
I know she doesn't have irritable bowel syndrome or something.

229
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,200
I do have IBS just not that IBS.

230
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Oh irritable bouncy boobies syndrome.

231
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,640
Okay so this is a good question.

232
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,880
Any children you have with your fans will be very beautiful but they'll be really really

233
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
dumb.

234
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:04,800
So if you your senpais had a child with your senpais they'd just be really dumb ass child

235
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
but they're you know.

236
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,760
I'm pressing the button because I'm kind of already dumb so it's like.

237
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:18,120
It's already gonna happen I'll push the button as long as that kind as long as that child

238
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,000
is kind and thoughtful a little stupidity is okay.

239
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:28,000
Hopefully they're not like that one character from the one book that accidentally kills

240
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,560
things because he's really dumb was like grapes of wrath I don't know.

241
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,560
Same author.

242
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
Forget it.

243
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
Yeah.

244
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
I hit the button.

245
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
I don't know.

246
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Where's my sign?

247
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
It is.

248
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
Who's the one pushing it out?

249
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
Huh?

250
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,960
78% said they wouldn't push the button.

251
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Yeah no.

252
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Uh-uh.

253
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,560
I think stupidity can be fixed.

254
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
They can't.

255
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
Just look at her fan bases.

256
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
I don't know about that.

257
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
I could be fixed.

258
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Yay!

259
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
There's a cure for a zure.

260
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,280
There's a hope for me.

261
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,960
Well this is a great question.

262
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,520
You find out vampires are real and you can become one live forever and use your vampire

263
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,520
powers to stop.

264
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,280
I don't know why it specifically says terrorists but sure.

265
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
Okay.

266
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
However.

267
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,800
Hero vampire got it.

268
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
You sparkle.

269
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,240
I don't want to sparkle.

270
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,240
You're one of those vampires.

271
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
Yes!

272
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Let's do it.

273
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,240
I don't want to sparkle.

274
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,240
You don't want to sparkle.

275
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
You don't want to sparkle.

276
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,240
You don't want to sparkle.

277
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,240
You only sparkle in my eyes Azura.

278
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
That's not enough for me.

279
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,240
I don't think I need to sparkle.

280
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
Let's go.

281
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:44,240
I get super powers to chase down my senpai and I'm sparkled.

282
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,140
I'm literally already a goddess.

283
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,880
Why do I need to be a vampire?

284
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,680
Well, not all of us are goddesses here, Mrs. Zura.

285
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,080
Some of us want superpowers.

286
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,880
And to sparkle.

287
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,880
I'm just a fucking rabbit.

288
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,080
Well, you have powers.

289
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,280
What are you talking about, Evie?

290
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,680
Yeah, you have a magic book.

291
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,580
I want a vampire.

292
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,280
Yeah, but you're still like, we don't know how old you are.

293
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,680
You're ancient.

294
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,580
You're like immortal.

295
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,880
Yeah.

296
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,480
Not beating those 3,000-year-olds.

297
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,280
Keeping funny allegations.

298
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,880
I'm going to press it.

299
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,180
I would love to be the sparkling terror of the night.

300
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,180
I thought you were going to say sparkling terror.

301
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,480
Ooh.

302
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,880
You can turn invisible whenever you want for as long as you want.

303
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,880
But everyone forgets you ever existed until you become visible again.

304
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,980
Yes.

305
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,480
Yes.

306
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,180
Yeah, yeah, sure.

307
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,880
I'll press the button.

308
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,280
Impressive.

309
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,080
Yeah, I feel like that's easy.

310
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,180
It doesn't even affect you.

311
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:47,780
Because you're invisible.

312
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,780
Yeah, it doesn't really.

313
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,180
Unless you're like trying to tell somebody what's going on and then you turn invisible

314
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,280
and then they just don't know what you're talking about.

315
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,680
You're in a hostage situation.

316
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,980
They don't even remember that you turned invisible.

317
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,580
That's good, yeah.

318
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,180
Press the button.

319
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,980
That's it.

320
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,580
These questions are so dumb.

321
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,080
All we do is like death.

322
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,480
And like, you could kill somebody.

323
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,380
But I'm like, OK, I get it.

324
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,080
Everybody wants to kill someone.

325
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,180
Death is death.

326
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,880
It's a very tall deal.

327
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
What did I say?

328
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Didn't I literally say that this is all these questions?

329
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,380
I'm so much deaf in it.

330
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,580
Yeah.

331
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,580
Can we get some questions from the audience then?

332
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,580
Does anybody have any questions for us?

333
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,380
Yeah, don't hold back.

334
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,880
Ask us your spicy questions.

335
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,980
Go crazy.

336
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,480
Yeah.

337
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,880
Go stupid.

338
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,980
Go crazy.

339
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,180
Go crazy.

340
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,880
Go crazy.

341
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,380
Go wild.

342
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,780
And then after that, we can do, like, would you rather?

343
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,780
OK.

344
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,580
Someone from my chat asked, who do you think

345
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,280
could do a handstand the longest?

346
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,780
Me.

347
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,280
Yeah, I would say Azura.

348
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,780
Why Azura?

349
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,280
Because she's the most athletic and muscle mommy

350
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,780
on the world.

351
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,280
Oh, that's true.

352
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
You're a Azura.

353
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
You're a Azura.

354
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Azura, yeah.

355
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Yeah, I'm a Azura.

356
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:11,780
Yeah.

357
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,280
She does that for fun.

358
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,380
She just walks around like that for fun.

359
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,680
That's why she's so muscly.

360
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,580
Muscly?

361
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,180
Her kids just smack her in the face.

362
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,680
That's the only annoyance.

363
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,580
I won't be able to see where I'm going.

364
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,680
Who would win a burping contest between the four of you?

365
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,980
Emmy.

366
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,280
I would say Emmy.

367
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,080
Really?

368
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,480
I mean, I mean, I can't, we could, we could go

369
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,580
because I could, I think I could do it.

370
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,280
Yeah, you want to go right now?

371
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,980
Let's do it.

372
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,980
Go right now.

373
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,780
Yeah.

374
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,180
I'm ready.

375
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,080
Azura, you go first.

376
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,380
Get ready to judge.

377
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,380
Yeah, you go first.

378
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,280
You go first.

379
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,880
You go first?

380
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
Yeah, you go first.

381
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,080
Okay, hold on.

382
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:04,880
That was weak.

383
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,280
That was pretty good.

384
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,780
Ratings, judges.

385
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,480
Please don't make yourself barf.

386
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,380
Please don't barf.

387
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,580
I'm the barf tuber here.

388
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,280
The median seems to be about four out of 10.

389
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,680
Oh, that was good.

390
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,180
Oh my God.

391
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,180
That was mine.

392
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
That was pretty good.

393
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,580
Should be like best two out of three.

394
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,480
It's so weak.

395
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,680
That's impressive.

396
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,780
That was pretty good.

397
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,880
Azura, your rebuttal.

398
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,680
Oh, shit.

399
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,080
Oh, shit.

400
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,280
I'm going to lose.

401
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,580
Maybe it is Azura.

402
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,880
Yeah.

403
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,280
My chat seems to think that Azura.

404
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,980
Yeah, Azura's winning.

405
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,480
Azura's best burp.

406
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,980
All right.

407
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,480
Well, that answers that question.

408
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,980
That answers that question.

409
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,280
That was pretty good.

410
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
Burpler.

411
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Thank God.

412
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,080
Oh, wow.

413
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,180
These girls, these bitches are disgusting.

414
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,780
Oh, burping.

415
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:22,480
Oh, someone says you're all lightweight needs training.

416
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,680
Performance anxiety.

417
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,080
Okay.

418
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,480
I can't get it up when people are watching.

419
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,080
Yeah, I swallowed a bit of air and that's going to come back

420
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,680
up like a crazy burp.

421
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,080
I can't wait.

422
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,880
Please don't mute.

423
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,280
Don't mute.

424
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,980
Just go like, whoa.

425
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,680
That'd be perfect.

426
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,180
All right.

427
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,980
Does anybody have any questions from their chat?

428
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,180
Amir or Azura?

429
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,880
I don't see any, any, any chatters with questions?

430
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,780
Anyone?

431
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,680
Any bleeding hearts with questions?

432
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,280
My girls are so cute.

433
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,080
Someone just asked, have you ever gotten caught by anyone other

434
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,080
than your parents?

435
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,680
Shut up.

436
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,480
Suck my dick.

437
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,080
I don't have good questions.

438
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,380
Oh, here, if all the, if all the members of viewer had who's

439
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,980
the most dumb competition, who would be the, what would be

440
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,880
the final rankings?

441
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,280
Me.

442
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,580
Actually, me and Azura might be tied for that.

443
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,980
A dumbass?

444
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,480
No, dumb.

445
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,080
It depends on what, on what they're doing because like,

446
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,480
you know, like, fun facts, I think I see would lose for fun

447
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:33,380
facts, but they would, you know, like, it's like, here's a bunch

448
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,580
of facts, which, which.

449
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,880
You know, we're saying dumb, not dumb.

450
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,280
Oh.

451
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:58,080
I think maybe we're all equally in our own special way.

452
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,180
The dumbest would be she be.

453
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:08,380
I would like, I like most doming out of all of us.

454
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:08,880
Yes.

455
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:15,180
Me because of my kayfabe, but in action, I would, I honestly

456
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,580
think it'd be you or mercy.

457
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,480
Me.

458
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,480
Really?

459
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,680
Yeah.

460
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:27,080
Like if besides myself, I would say maybe in me or mercy.

461
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,580
We gotta have a dumb off now.

462
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:29,780
Yeah.

463
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,580
Well, I feel it.

464
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,280
Well, then I saw my mommy voice and everything freaks out.

465
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,380
Feel like all of us have our own sterness in the way.

466
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,780
Open your mouth.

467
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,780
Shut up, you good girl.

468
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,280
All right.

469
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,980
So good at taking it off.

470
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,980
Thank you, mommy.

471
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,980
Be a good girl for me.

472
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,180
And do as she says.

473
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,180
If you're bad, I might have to spank you.

474
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,180
Slick, slick, slick, slick, slick.

475
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,080
Squish, squish, squish, squish, squish.

476
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,880
Grab a water bottle and just like.

477
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,980
The chat is spamming the step on me email.

478
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,080
Someone asked, wait, is there a, do you have one in your chat?

479
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:35,980
Yeah, there's our individual questions.

480
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,480
Okay.

481
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,980
I think questions for all four of us would be good too.

482
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,180
Well, we can answer too.

483
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,480
Someone has a question for mercy.

484
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:42,980
Yeah.

485
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,480
Hmm.

486
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,280
Someone has a question for mercy.

487
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:59,080
If you, if you had a, if you had a chance to design an outfit for someone and BLR, who

488
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,680
would you design one for?

489
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,280
I've already designed all of you guys.

490
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,580
Yeah.

491
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,780
She did, she did, she did outfits for all of us.

492
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,480
I think, I still think like all of them are super cute.

493
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,880
So if anyone wants to do art of them.

494
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,480
Oh, someone said, who do you think is the most degen of the four?

495
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
Degen.

496
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,380
Stronger.

497
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,180
Um, I think a lot of us hide our power level from each other.

498
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,080
Stronger.

499
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,780
I think it's strong.

500
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,380
They say out of the, I think all of you might be four of us.

501
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,680
Oh, out of the four of us, the four of us, the four of us might be in me.

502
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,980
If I was in another form, I might, uh, I think it's in me.

503
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,980
It means the degen, but I think it's me.

504
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,480
I got to keep classy being, being mad.

505
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,980
Um, although just wait for my hentai tag to remember stream.

506
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,480
People are going to be like, oh, canceled.

507
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:04,280
So I said, uh, who is the strongest drinker out of all four of us?

508
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,880
Not me.

509
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,680
I don't drink.

510
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,480
Uh, yeah.

511
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,780
Mercia doesn't like to drink.

512
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,680
So you don't drink.

513
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,980
I think that probably ended up being me.

514
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,980
How much do you drink a zero?

515
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,780
I was, yeah, I feel like a zero could take you.

516
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,580
How much do you drink?

517
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,980
Three, three to four bottles of soju.

518
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,180
Of soju?

519
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,680
I don't know.

520
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,180
So I'll have like one bottle of soju and halfway through it.

521
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,280
I'm already gone.

522
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:34,580
I don't know how much I drink, but if I want to have fun, I'll

523
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,680
have like a whole bottle of Baileys.

524
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,580
Why are you blushing at me?

525
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,580
Is something the matter?

526
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:40,980
Matter.

527
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,880
I, I, yeah, I don't drink.

528
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,080
And I'm, I, if when I do drink, I'm super lightweight.

529
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,180
So, yeah.

530
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,180
They're so probably in the super drunk audio, like a one drink.

531
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,080
Uh, huge sips and I'm gone.

532
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,680
Yeah, but all the fucking medication I'm on, I'm done.

533
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,280
Someone said you could squirt the farthest.

534
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,880
Next question.

535
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,380
Thank me.

536
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:25,280
I'd probably say all of the girls is like abilities, you know, I

537
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:25,580
don't know.

538
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,480
I can, I can, when I'm trying and I'm like in the shower, I

539
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,980
feel like I can piss pretty far.

540
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,780
If I had the force, wait, wait, was there a question about

541
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,380
how did this happen?

542
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,780
Like a score is essentially pissed just like whatever, but

543
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,380
I feel like Amy would squirt the most.

544
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,980
Oh, excuse me, sorry.

545
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,780
And then I would squirt the farthest.

546
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,180
Okay.

547
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,780
Yeah, maybe we should have a contest for this too.

548
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,580
Yeah.

549
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,780
Yeah, we'll try that out.

550
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,580
Okay, ready?

551
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,080
I think that goes so hard that it's over in less than like

552
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,880
two seconds and probably out of everyone.

553
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,480
I go to idol meetings the most.

554
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,980
You think so?

555
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,380
Oh, yes.

556
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,180
You could be a lot like once a day.

557
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,180
She go to a bathroom like every like five minutes.

558
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,380
You got a small bladder.

559
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,680
Pissing all by herself.

560
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,080
Pissing all by herself.

561
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,480
I gave her the crown of toilet queen.

562
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,680
She's the toilet queen.

563
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,980
She's regular toilet queen stuff, but pissing.

564
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,080
That's another story.

565
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,280
We really are.

566
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:49,180
I just, I drink a lot of water.

567
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,980
So that's good.

568
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:51,780
You're hydrated.

569
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,780
My piss is like highlighter yellow.

570
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,480
So I'm going to get some water.

571
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,680
My girl needs to drink more.

572
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,680
Yeah, drink more.

573
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,180
I drink a lot of water.

574
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,980
Mine is pretty clear, but I have an issue with getting up

575
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,180
and going to the bathroom.

576
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,580
I just sit here for a long time having to pee for like hours.

577
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,680
You don't like pee?

578
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,380
I would.

579
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,180
There's so many things I'd rather be doing than peeing.

580
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,180
So I'm just holding my pee for really long time.

581
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,480
I love pissing.

582
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,180
I hate peeing.

583
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:20,980
I just go.

584
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,680
I just go.

585
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,980
I'm like, yeah, just go.

586
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,280
I need an iron break.

587
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:24,580
Yeah.

588
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,980
If you need to go, just go.

589
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,680
I hold it.

590
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,480
I got stuff to do in this thing.

591
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:29,880
Yeah.

592
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,380
Right.

593
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:30,980
I agree.

594
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,680
She be.

595
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,080
And sometimes it's my excuse to get out of out of a situation.

596
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,980
Yeah.

597
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,580
Like if I want to do something, I'll just go to the bathroom

598
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,580
for like an hour.

599
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,880
I think I'm used to it.

600
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,380
I think I'm used to it because I would play games.

601
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:52,180
Like, like, like, that requires you to not get up.

602
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,680
So you got to be, you got to like kind of hold it in.

603
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,880
It's the gamers that don't like to piss because they don't want

604
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,180
to be interrupted.

605
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,080
Exactly.

606
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,380
Azura doesn't want to piss between League games.

607
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,980
I can't piss between matches.

608
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,980
Hey, I didn't say what game.

609
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,780
I didn't say what game.

610
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,280
You have to say what game.

611
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,180
We know.

612
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,180
We know.

613
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,380
We know which one.

614
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:21,680
Come on, guys.

615
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,880
Give us some questions.

616
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,480
Exposing my chat.

617
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,880
Someone asked who's the craziest.

618
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,880
Oh, wait, wait, I have a question here.

619
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,680
Okay, okay.

620
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,380
What is one horror character you think you could take in a fight?

621
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,380
Pyramid head.

622
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,180
I'm sucking them all.

623
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,880
I'm sorry.

624
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,680
That was impossible.

625
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,180
I don't even know where that came from.

626
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:48,980
Whoa.

627
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:56,180
I didn't even think that just literally just hit me like a

628
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,980
like a stroke.

629
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,680
I was like, oh my God.

630
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,680
I'm understandable.

631
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,480
All of them might just get really big and step on them.

632
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,980
Brahms from the movie The Boy.

633
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,180
I'm sucking him off too.

634
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,680
Oh, a hundred percent.

635
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,480
Oh my gosh.

636
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,680
Get out of my walls into my bed.

637
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,880
Horror guys are like, most of these horror creatures are like

638
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,980
immortal and I'm just a cute girl.

639
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,480
Oh, Jason.

640
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,480
Oh, no, please.

641
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
There's just an issue.

642
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,180
I don't know.

643
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,180
Oh, Freddie Krueger.

644
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:27,980
Stop.

645
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,480
Oh.

646
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,880
No, no, whatever will I do?

647
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,680
It has nothing to do with horror anymore.

648
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,880
I'm sorry.

649
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:43,180
As long as it's not Godzilla, I'll take, I'll take him.

650
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,180
I don't think I can take on Godzilla.

651
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,180
I think I'll take him.

652
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,180
If we could take on anybody.

653
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,180
Yeah.

654
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,180
Does that count as horror?

655
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,180
You would step around.

656
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,180
I'm just like, just step around.

657
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,180
That was a good question.

658
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,180
I would win again.

659
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,180
Maybe I would like team up with all of them.

660
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,180
Oh, okay.

661
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,180
You're teaming up with all of them?

662
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,180
Yeah, like, you know, we, we go.

663
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,180
I didn't know Mercy would like that.

664
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,180
Okay.

665
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,180
Wait, what?

666
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,180
Nothing.

667
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,180
Don't worry about it.

668
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,180
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what?

669
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,180
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

670
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,180
Next question.

671
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,180
Does nobody have anything?

672
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,180
In a hunger game setting, who is the winner?

673
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,180
I see.

674
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,180
I see?

675
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,180
I feel like she'd destroy us.

676
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,180
She's a feral polar bear.

677
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,180
That's true.

678
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,180
I was thinking Azura because she can get big.

679
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,180
Yeah, but she's too sweet.

680
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,180
She doesn't want to hurt her creation.

681
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,180
Oh, that's true.

682
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,180
That's true.

683
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,180
That's true.

684
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,180
I would say it's down between I see and Mercy.

685
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,180
I don't want to hurt the babies.

686
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,180
I hurt my girls, but if I have to.

687
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,180
If you have to.

688
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,180
I'll do what I must.

689
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,180
Okay.

690
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,180
Someone in my chat asked something, too.

691
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,180
Oh, will you all ever do an NSFW collab?

692
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,180
Like, in what context?

693
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,180
Like, what context, though?

694
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,180
But yeah, like, generally, yeah.

695
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,180
They didn't get a collab.

696
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,180
I'm guessing Patreon.

697
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
Yes.

698
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,180
Yeah, oh, 100%.

699
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,180
Yeah.

700
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,180
Wait for a video game to come out.

701
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,180
Yeah.

702
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,180
People forget we have an NSFW game coming out.

703
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,180
The art.

704
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,180
Oh, boy.

705
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,180
I want to ask.

706
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:54,180
Someone asked what meal or food could be your only meal

707
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,180
for the rest of your life?

708
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,180
Your cum.

709
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,180
Oh, my God.

710
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,180
Give me your peepee.

711
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,180
You have to say something like, yeah,

712
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,180
I can probably eat sushi for the rest of my life.

713
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,180
I don't know.

714
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,180
I can't do that.

715
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,180
No, I can't do that.

716
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,180
That's torture.

717
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,180
I don't want to answer that question.

718
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,180
I could probably go with curry for the rest of my life.

719
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,180
I would say it was any sort of rice dish.

720
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,180
Like, if you could eat rice or pasta for the rest of your life,

721
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,180
I'd probably pick rice.

722
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,180
Probably rice.

723
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,180
Yeah.

724
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,180
Rice.

725
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,180
Rice, rice.

726
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,180
Yeah, rice.

727
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,180
Oh, is the video game going to be voice?

728
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,180
Yes.

729
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,180
How much will the game cost?

730
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,180
Yeah.

731
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,180
It's free, motherfucker.

732
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,180
It's free.

733
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,180
It's free.

734
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:48,180
You get to do awesome stuff that I'm not going to reveal yet.

735
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,180
For free.

736
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,180
We'll suck you for free.

737
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,180
Oh, now I'm like blushing.

738
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,180
What is there to blush about?

739
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,180
Don't ask.

740
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,180
It's like, it's like, it's so intimate.

741
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,180
That's true.

742
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,180
You are on somebody with your,

743
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,180
your scissors in their face while you,

744
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,180
you know, ride them cowboys.

745
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,180
Very intimate.

746
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,180
So it's cool.

747
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:19,180
Who can do the best impersonation of any ViaLore streamer?

748
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,180
Chibi.

749
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,180
Chibi.

750
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,180
Chibi is just impersonation in general.

751
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,180
Yeah.

752
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,180
I'm going to get better.

753
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,180
After watching the haul live debut of Elizabeth Bloodflame,

754
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,180
I'm like, I got to get on her level, man.

755
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,180
Although she's like professional voice actress,

756
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,180
but it is what it is.

757
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,180
I want to be that level.

758
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,180
I'm waiting for Chibi to do Mercy's laugh.

759
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,180
Yeah, do Mercy.

760
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,180
Wait, what's Mercy?

761
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,180
Do your laugh.

762
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,180
Yeah, Mercy go first.

763
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,180
Excuse me.

764
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,180
Now I'm shy.

765
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,180
Now I've got performance anxiety.

766
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,180
Oh my God.

767
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,180
You can do it.

768
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,180
You can do it.

769
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,180
Someone say a charm.

770
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,180
Penis.

771
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,180
I think I just coughed instead.

772
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,180
Well, she cut out.

773
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,180
Yeah.

774
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,180
And then is there a talk?

775
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,180
Sample sentence.

776
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,180
Give us, give us something mommy.

777
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,180
I love all my babies.

778
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,180
I love all my babies.

779
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,180
It's really close.

780
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,180
I know.

781
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,180
I'm trying.

782
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,180
There's a tone to it.

783
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,180
Give yourself a lisp and it'll work.

784
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,180
I can't, but like, I, it's weird,

785
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,180
but I can't hear a lisp for you.

786
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,180
You don't have a lisp.

787
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,180
It's there.

788
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,180
To me, you don't have one.

789
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,180
I have one.

790
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,180
I have a lisp.

791
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,180
It's definitely there.

792
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,180
The tiniest lisp.

793
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,180
It's definitely not funny.

794
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,180
More like an accent to me.

795
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,180
Yeah, it feels like an accent.

796
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,180
Yeah.

797
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,180
It's more like a controlled lisp.

798
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,180
A controlled lisp.

799
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,180
I have to work around it so people can understand me.

800
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,180
It's already hard enough for people to understand me.

801
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,180
We can understand you just fine.

802
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,180
Yeah, I know you.

803
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,180
Yay.

804
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,180
I'm happy.

805
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,180
Yay.

806
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,180
I'm beautiful.

807
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,180
Like, honestly, I haven't been able to do Emmy's voice.

808
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,180
I can't do Emmy's voice.

809
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,180
I'm just too, I'm just too good.

810
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,180
I'm just too original.

811
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,180
Whoa.

812
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:44,180
It's like, I, I feel like I can only do one, like,

813
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,180
funny voice.

814
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,180
I like, I like Emmy's, I like Emmy's laugh

815
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,180
because she sounds like Timo.

816
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,180
I sound like Timo?

817
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,180
I don't know what Timo sounds like.

818
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,180
League.

819
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,180
Oh, do you remember when the fucking voice lines

820
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,180
I sent in chat one time when we were recording lines

821
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,180
for the trailer?

822
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,180
Yeah.

823
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,180
And Zara asked me to voice Timo.

824
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,180
Yeah.

825
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,180
I'm like Timo.

826
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,180
Like Timo laughing or just like Timo in general?

827
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,180
You sound like Timo laughing.

828
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,180
No, you sound like Timo in general.

829
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,180
Oh, fuck.

830
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,180
I'm going to go listen right now.

831
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,180
Timo's voice.

832
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,180
Oh, it's an ugly fucking furry too.

833
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,180
Timo's known as Lil Satan.

834
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,180
Like people, people don't like that character.

835
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,180
Yeah, I've never played Lil Satan in my life.

836
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,180
Lil Satan?

837
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,180
Wow.

838
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,180
Yeah.

839
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,180
Who does that remind you of?

840
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,180
Do a line.

841
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,180
Do a Timo line.

842
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,180
Um, hold on.

843
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,180
Let me listen.

844
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,180
I've already played Timo lines for a while.

845
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,180
Arden ready.

846
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,180
That's got it.

847
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,180
That's got a sting.

848
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:55,180
I've already done Timo lines for a zero and for my chat.

849
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,180
I played it for them the ones I recorded.

850
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,180
Did it work?

851
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,180
Did it sound like Timo?

852
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,180
Did it?

853
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,180
It was a furry confirmed.

854
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,180
It was a furry confirmed.

855
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,180
Oh God, you nailed it.

856
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,180
Yay!

857
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,180
I could just be Timo.

858
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,180
So cute.

859
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,180
I love you.

860
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,180
I love you.

861
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,180
I love all my girls.

862
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,180
Should we do a Peter Griffin voice?

863
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,180
I'm a scout ahead.

864
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,180
Zara's dying.

865
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,180
I think she's fangirling over League's stuff, maybe.

866
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,180
She's gone.

867
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,180
She's gone.

868
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,180
Yeah, she's happy.

869
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,180
Her voice is so cute.

870
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,180
Wait, is it League on your Steam library?

871
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,180
Yeah.

872
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,180
Yeah, well I have.

873
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,180
Yes, I do have League.

874
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,180
Everybody's downloaded League sometime in their life.

875
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:51,180
I now love League and then immediately got sick after it.

876
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,180
I was overwhelmed from the hood.

877
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,180
Hey, Peter, nice cat.

878
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,180
Hey, Peter, nice cock.

879
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,180
Peter.

880
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,180
Peter.

881
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,180
There's a horse.

882
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,180
The horse is cute.

883
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,180
Peter.

884
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,180
Jo and Quagmire's in there.

885
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,180
That's the dumbest shit I ever heard, Peter.

886
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,180
That was pretty good.

887
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,180
Is that a Zara?

888
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,180
That's the dumbest shit I ever heard, Peter.

889
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,180
I can't tell.

890
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,180
Who was that?

891
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,180
I know, because nobody's mouth is moving.

892
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,180
Sorry, that was me.

893
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,180
Zara can do good impressions too, that's for sure.

894
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,180
She also has the same voice range as me.

895
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,180
Oh yeah, that's true.

896
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:42,180
Everyone has such a good voice range and I'm just like, where am I?

897
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,180
Here.

898
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,180
You're fine.

899
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,180
You have a beautiful voice.

900
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,180
You're fine.

901
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,180
You're fine.

902
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,180
You're cute.

903
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,180
You have beautiful voices.

904
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,180
I cum every time.

905
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,180
I mean, I'm cummin.

906
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,180
You're coming?

907
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,180
What?

908
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,180
No, cummin, cummin.

909
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,180
In my mouth?

910
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,180
You're cummin?

911
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,180
Yeah.

912
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,180
Yeah, cummin.

913
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,180
Yeah, I'm cummin.

914
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,180
I thought it was cummin.

915
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,180
Shut up.

916
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,180
Is it coming?

917
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,180
I don't know, man.

918
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,180
Cute and funny Zara.

919
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,180
Yeah, she can do a cutie voice.

920
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:13,180
I think you can do like a cute, cutie voice.

921
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,180
Yeah.

922
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,180
We did one yesterday, not yesterday.

923
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,180
A couple days ago in our collab.

924
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,180
You switched to it randomly.

925
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,180
Yeah.

926
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,180
When you're like happy.

927
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,180
I do.

928
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,180
I don't know.

929
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,180
I don't know.

930
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,180
I mean, Zara both do that.

931
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,180
Don't do that.

932
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,180
I don't like it.

933
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,180
Don't do that.

934
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,180
You turned it up perfect.

935
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,180
We're all cute and funny at heart.

936
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:42,180
I think they have great cute and funny voices.

937
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,180
My voice isn't cute.

938
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,180
It's ugly.

939
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,180
Oh, she's so cute.

940
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,180
Such a trashy.

941
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,180
Is he?

942
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,180
Mine just sounds like a really annoying like anime dub.

943
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,180
Is he ugly?

944
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,180
My cat is.

945
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,180
Oh, don't worry.

946
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,180
Yeah, don't worry.

947
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,180
Sorry, I'm chewing an airhead.

948
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,180
It's okay.

949
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:07,180
Never underestimate the power of the scout's code.

950
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,180
What the fuck?

951
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,180
Someone just asked me to say that.

952
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,180
Can you all do cute and funny voices for two minutes?

953
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,180
Oh my God.

954
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,180
Cute and funny challenge?

955
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,180
Okay.

956
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,180
Well, you're...

957
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,180
You don't...

958
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,180
You have to do a mature voice.

959
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,180
Yeah, you have to do a mature voice.

960
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,180
Hold on, hold on.

961
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,180
I have to get more water.

962
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,180
I'll be right back.

963
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,180
You guys talk.

964
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:34,180
Never underestimate the power of the scout's code.

965
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,180
Okay, that's really good.

966
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,180
Never underestimate the power of the scout's code.

967
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,180
Why are we all talking like that?

968
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,180
Because we're doing a cute and funny challenge.

969
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,180
Oh, okay.

970
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,180
Are we doing a cute and funny challenge?

971
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,180
I guess I'll do it too.

972
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,180
Yeah.

973
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:54,180
And then I don't want anyone to get mad at me and tweet.

974
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,180
I don't care.

975
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,180
It's whatever.

976
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,180
I didn't tweet at all.

977
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,180
I just forget.

978
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,180
Never underestimate the power of the scout's code.

979
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,180
Scout's code.

980
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,180
Why scout's code?

981
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,180
Wait, hold on.

982
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,180
I need to make myself smaller.

983
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,180
No, I'm cute and funny.

984
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,180
I'll just hide my chest.

985
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,180
Now I'm short.

986
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,180
Now I can read your BP easier because I'm eye level with it.

987
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,180
Sorry, what?

988
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,180
Could you repeat that?

989
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,180
What's the funniest thing you've read recently?

990
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,180
Your tweets.

991
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,180
Get a fucking life loser.

992
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,180
Oh my God.

993
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,180
I'm in biting range.

994
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,180
Give me your fucking ankles.

995
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,180
Give me some wiggles.

996
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,180
I'm the kuzugaki now.

997
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,180
Water in the cage.

998
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:07,180
Water in the cage.

999
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,180
You guys are in my bedroom.

1000
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,180
Oh, everyone's in my bedroom too.

1001
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,180
So I could put you guys on the cage.

1002
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,180
I can also, I'm perfect height to sniff in me.

1003
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:29,180
If either of you could work on a song with the favorite band or artist, who would it be?

1004
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,180
Doja Cat!

1005
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,180
I hate cops.

1006
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,180
No, that was so quick.

1007
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,180
Because I'll be fucking sick.

1008
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:40,180
I've been talking this whole time and I've been muted.

1009
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,180
Fuck.

1010
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,180
The whole stream?

1011
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:52,180
No, like a couple of years ago I was talking with you guys and I was muted.

1012
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,180
How did you even mute yourself?

1013
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,180
Well, because I went to get more water so I muted my mic.

1014
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,180
Oh, that's right.

1015
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,180
And then I forgot to unmute.

1016
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,180
You were going to do your mommy vlog.

1017
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,180
Yeah, she definitely forget to flush the toilet.

1018
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,180
I didn't go to the bathroom.

1019
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,180
I didn't go to the bathroom.

1020
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,180
I just got more water.

1021
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,180
I was here.

1022
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,180
Can you give your best mommy impression?

1023
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,180
I don't have a mommy voice.

1024
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,180
That's the problem.

1025
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,180
Everyone always assumes like, oh, she can do cunny voice.

1026
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,180
So that means she can do mommy voice too.

1027
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,180
You could just go real deep.

1028
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,180
Why do you sound country?

1029
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,180
Our country voice.

1030
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,180
Go real, real deep, real deep.

1031
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,180
Yo, what's up?

1032
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,180
Yo, what's up?

1033
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,180
Welcome to Alabama.

1034
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,180
K-Y-S.

1035
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,180
Hey, kiss your fucking sister, brother.

1036
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,180
Alabama.

1037
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,180
Get over here.

1038
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,180
I don't know about that one.

1039
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,180
That's it.

1040
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,180
Alabama.

1041
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,180
Hey, y'all.

1042
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,180
Hey, y'all.

1043
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,180
Hey, y'all.

1044
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,180
Hey, y'all.

1045
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,180
My name, Bubba Gooddick.

1046
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,180
And I give Bubba good play.

1047
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,180
Bubba good play.

1048
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,180
Bubba good play.

1049
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,180
Bubba good play.

1050
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,180
Yeah, y'all.

1051
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,180
Save a boy.

1052
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,180
Just ride a cowboy.

1053
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,180
Roll time.

1054
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,180
Save a horse.

1055
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,180
Ride a cowboy.

1056
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,180
I don't know what the fuck this is,

1057
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:19,180
but this is the first ASMR stream I've been on.

1058
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,180
Brother, in what world are we doing ASMR?

1059
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,180
Bring out this show, please.

1060
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,180
Someone asked me, Christ.

1061
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:33,180
Which of the seven deadly sins is your sin of choice and why?

1062
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,180
Why?

1063
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,180
Gluttony.

1064
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,180
Gluttony.

1065
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,180
For him me.

1066
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,180
Gluttony.

1067
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,180
I want you.

1068
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:46,180
Maybe, you know, I might, maybe envy.

1069
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,180
Oh, envy too.

1070
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,180
Because I use envy as a motivation for myself sometimes,

1071
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,180
because I'm like, I want to do this.

1072
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,180
Cry.

1073
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,180
Or wrath, yeah, or wrath.

1074
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,180
I do have anger issues sometimes.

1075
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,180
I know wrath.

1076
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,180
Wrath is definitely like my anger issues.

1077
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,180
Yeah.

1078
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,180
I'm like, let me just break everything.

1079
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,180
Lust is pants.

1080
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,180
Lust is all of ours.

1081
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:08,180
Yeah.

1082
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,180
Me and me.

1083
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,180
We're all lost.

1084
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,180
Why would we break it up?

1085
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:17,180
I think I definitely have a lot of wrath in me.

1086
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:18,180
And it comes out.

1087
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,180
What?

1088
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,180
I'm just lazy.

1089
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:24,180
I'm a lazy bitch.

1090
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,180
So slow.

1091
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,180
So am I, yeah.

1092
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,180
Oh, you don't need to break things.

1093
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,180
You have us for that.

1094
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,180
Yeah, but you're not like physically in front of me,

1095
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,180
or I'd be beating the shit out of you right now.

1096
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,180
Beat your goddess.

1097
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,180
And give her your soul.

1098
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,180
I just love watching Azura's expressions.

1099
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,180
Her freeze tracking is superb.

1100
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,180
I don't know what it is.

1101
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:49,180
I think all of us have like equal face tracking.

1102
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:52,180
It's just some of us are more.

1103
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:56,180
I would end to extreme deaths to like really make the face

1104
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,180
a little tracking fix.

1105
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,180
Like, oh my face.

1106
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,180
Some of us have, what's it called?

1107
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,180
V.C. face?

1108
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,180
Or V. Bridger?

1109
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,180
V. Bridger.

1110
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:10,180
Some of us, I see has V. Bridger in her, in her,

1111
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,180
in her rigging, but I don't know if I do.

1112
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,180
V. Bridger.

1113
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,180
Am I rigging?

1114
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,180
Yeah.

1115
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,180
I see does.

1116
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,180
You might.

1117
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,180
You might.

1118
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,180
You might.

1119
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,180
Yeah, you might.

1120
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,180
I do.

1121
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,180
I saw, I see those.

1122
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:26,180
I didn't see it in my, in my rigging files.

1123
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,180
I don't know.

1124
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,180
Oh, interesting.

1125
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,180
But that's a story for another day.

1126
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,180
That's a story for another day.

1127
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,180
I will never tell.

1128
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,180
Yeah, strong because all that story.

1129
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,180
What?

1130
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,180
I hate.

1131
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,180
Really?

1132
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,180
Seriously?

1133
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,180
Are you serious?

1134
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,180
Seriously what?

1135
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:45,180
Was Azura's pancake burnt or not?

1136
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,180
They were burnt.

1137
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,180
They weren't burnt!

1138
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,180
They weren't burnt!

1139
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,180
They weren't burnt.

1140
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,180
They were burnt.

1141
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,180
I'm sorry.

1142
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,180
I'm really proud.

1143
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,180
Cookie bear, sweetheart, sugar, pumpkin,

1144
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,180
pumpkin pie.

1145
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,180
Those were burnt.

1146
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:00,180
No!

1147
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,180
Burn.

1148
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,180
I'm sorry, sweetie.

1149
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,180
What fucking pancakes are we talking about right now?

1150
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,180
No one that Azura posted.

1151
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,180
You know, the one with the butter on top.

1152
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:13,180
And you think I would call Azura's other pancakes a burnt?

1153
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,180
You know.

1154
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,180
I don't know.

1155
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,180
God damn.

1156
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,180
That's some black on black crime.

1157
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,180
They weren't burnt.

1158
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,180
It was just the lighting.

1159
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,180
I swear.

1160
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,180
More questions.

1161
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,180
More questions.

1162
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,180
Hand them over.

1163
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,180
Grabby hands.

1164
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:43,180
I had one but I lost it.

1165
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:45,180
I lost all my questions too.

1166
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:49,180
You know, if it is ginger,

1167
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,180
am I strawberry blonde?

1168
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,180
I guess so.

1169
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,180
I think you're just blonde.

1170
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:54,180
Wait.

1171
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,180
I'm still salty about that.

1172
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,180
I'm not fucking ginger, dude.

1173
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,180
I thought you were redder.

1174
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,180
You were redder in your life changing.

1175
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,180
You're redder in your concept art.

1176
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,180
Yeah.

1177
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,180
But your model is lighter blonde hair.

1178
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,180
Oh, wow.

1179
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:09,180
But then I have like,

1180
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,180
then I'm ginger at the ends.

1181
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,180
Although I don't know if my hair is dyed.

1182
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:15,180
Why are you bouncing right now?

1183
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,180
I would call yours a sunset.

1184
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:23,180
I would call your hair sunset.

1185
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,180
What are you saying?

1186
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,180
A sunset gradient.

1187
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,180
Mercy's attempted at Riz.

1188
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,180
Your hair is like

1189
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,180
the rays of a sunset.

1190
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,180
Okay, sorry.

1191
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,180
What were you going to ask?

1192
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,180
Someone asked what do you guys plan on doing

1193
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:43,180
if you get 3D models?

1194
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,180
Dance.

1195
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,180
Dance.

1196
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,180
Yeah, pretty much.

1197
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,180
Dance.

1198
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,180
Do you have a bunch of poses?

1199
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,180
Work.

1200
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,180
Pull dancing.

1201
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,180
We want to do pull dancing.

1202
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,180
Oh yeah, we did talk about pull dancing.

1203
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,180
Like a potential pull dancing,

1204
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,180
and all of us fail,

1205
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,180
or at least me fail.

1206
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,180
I want to get a lot of fuck you money

1207
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,180
so that we can get our own studio.

1208
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,180
That would be so sick, our own 3D studio.

1209
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,180
That'd be insane.

1210
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,180
I mean, we all meet up

1211
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,180
and pull dance together.

1212
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:14,180
We thought about doing like classes, right?

1213
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,180
Yeah.

1214
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,180
I'll call it a pull.

1215
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,180
That'd be so fun.

1216
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,180
Yeah!

1217
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,180
And then they're like fun.

1218
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,180
Probably like,

1219
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:31,180
I would just stream regularly with a 3D model.

1220
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,180
People don't know how,

1221
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,180
I move so much.

1222
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,180
My tail.

1223
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:38,180
Yeah, we talk with our hands.

1224
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,180
Yeah, we're very animated.

1225
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,180
So.

1226
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:45,180
Now we can only talk with our hips.

1227
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,180
Yeah.

1228
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,180
And our tits.

1229
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:50,180
You talk with your hips.

1230
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:53,180
Be the Helen Keller and talk with your hips.

1231
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,180
Hips don't lie, you know?

1232
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,180
I'm very kind of like un-flexible,

1233
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:09,180
so like I think it'll be very funny to see me pull it.

1234
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,180
I'm un-flexible, too.

1235
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:16,180
Yeah, it'd be funny trying to pull myself up on something.

1236
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:20,180
You'll actually see how little upper arm strength I have.

1237
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,180
And he's trying.

1238
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,180
I think it would be,

1239
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:31,180
I think it'll be really funny.

1240
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:34,180
Someone said if you could pick who would,

1241
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:38,180
if you could pick who would you swap outfits with in Villalor?

1242
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:43,180
Mercy.

1243
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,180
Yeah, Mercy.

1244
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,180
You wanna wear my outfit?

1245
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,180
Yeah, it's really cute.

1246
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,180
You're very cute.

1247
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:54,180
I'm very much like the aesthetic of Mercy

1248
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,180
and Amy's emo outfit.

1249
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,180
I really like him.

1250
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,180
I would also be a totally goth mommy.

1251
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,180
I know Azura would, too.

1252
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,180
We all like goth mommy, too.

1253
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:09,180
Literally my entire closet is pretty much goth clothes,

1254
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,180
so it'd be so funny if two point-os

1255
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,180
if we all just had like a goth model.

1256
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:19,180
I think it's so funny that like all these girls dress so cutely

1257
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:22,180
and then I'm like, I just like this for my senpai's

1258
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:26,180
and then you see a while you're just like big giant t-shirt.

1259
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:31,180
Yeah, I just have like big giant t-shirt.

1260
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:34,180
I go out, I wear my sweater,

1261
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:38,180
my hoodie, my oversized hoodie with leggings

1262
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,180
and blend in.

1263
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,180
I like to go all out when I go outside sometimes.

1264
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:48,180
Oh, they're so beautiful.

1265
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,180
And then I see could be pastel goth.

1266
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:54,180
Should be cute and good.

1267
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,180
I was thinking like I could do like,

1268
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,180
if we do like a two point-o,

1269
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,180
I'd be like some kind of G-R-I-K.

1270
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,180
I was thinking that, yeah, 100% for you, G-R-I-K.

1271
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:04,180
I was like re-think,

1272
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:07,180
because after you guys did your like design streams,

1273
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:10,180
I was like, oh, what would I draw you guys as?

1274
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,180
And I was definitely thinking G-R-I-K for you.

1275
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:17,180
I would definitely love if I have like a updated two point-o.

1276
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,180
I would love to do like some G-R-I-K or something.

1277
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:23,180
I would probably just go,

1278
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:25,180
I don't even know what I would do.

1279
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:28,180
I think, I think, oh, it would be really nice

1280
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,180
if you had like a very, very mermaid skirt.

1281
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:33,180
Mermaid?

1282
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,180
Mermaid?

1283
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,180
Aquatic bunny here.

1284
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:40,180
I just turned into like a sea bunny.

1285
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:41,180
That would be cute.

1286
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,180
Like those little sea slugs.

1287
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,180
Like those little funny guys, right?

1288
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,180
Yeah.

1289
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,180
That would be so adorable.

1290
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,180
Zero looks very suspicious.

1291
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,180
Her expression.

1292
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:56,180
She's drinking her boba.

1293
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:59,180
And it's really funny watching her.

1294
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:03,180
Oh.

1295
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:06,180
She looks like she got caught doing something suspicious.

1296
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:10,180
Whatever do you mean?

1297
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,180
Wait, can you go drink something again?

1298
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,180
Because we look angry while you do it.

1299
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,180
That's funny.

1300
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,180
Looks like she's going to start talking shit.

1301
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,180
I love salt powder.

1302
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:29,180
Like, all right.

1303
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,180
I can't drink.

1304
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:36,180
I can't drink.

1305
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:40,180
Someone said,

1306
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:42,180
if you could visit anywhere in the world,

1307
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:43,180
where would it be?

1308
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,180
These questions are boring.

1309
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:47,180
Ask something intense.

1310
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:48,180
Your house.

1311
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,180
Your house.

1312
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:51,180
Your fucking bed.

1313
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:52,180
Like, I don't know.

1314
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:54,180
Your dad's bed.

1315
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:57,180
I probably didn't ask Ronnie to be honest.

1316
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,180
Sonny actually loves.

1317
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,180
Like come on,

1318
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,180
come on.

1319
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,180
Give me some spicy questions.

1320
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:03,180
Yeah.

1321
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:04,180
What are these questions?

1322
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,180
Spicy questions.

1323
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,180
I'm not answering the poop question.

1324
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:10,180
Okay.

1325
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,180
There's a poop question.

1326
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:13,180
There's a poop question.

1327
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:18,180
Which of you could throw Amy the farthest?

1328
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:20,180
Me.

1329
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:21,180
I would say, yeah,

1330
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,180
Azora.

1331
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,180
Azora then me.

1332
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:25,180
Especially if she grows giant.

1333
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,180
Yeah.

1334
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,180
Okay.

1335
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,180
Yeah.

1336
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:32,180
Who in your eyes has the most intense fans?

1337
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,180
I see.

1338
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:35,180
I see.

1339
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,180
Yeah.

1340
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,180
Yeah.

1341
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:38,180
Her.

1342
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:39,180
Her daughter.

1343
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,180
How about out of the four of us?

1344
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:42,180
Out of the four of us.

1345
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:43,180
Out of the four of us, then Amy.

1346
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:44,180
Amy.

1347
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:45,180
And everybody,

1348
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:46,180
I'm telling you,

1349
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:49,180
when people just get a whiff of that cute and funny,

1350
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:50,180
they go, they go feral.

1351
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:53,180
They go feral.

1352
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:55,180
To me,

1353
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,180
Amy has probably

1354
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,180
very interesting fans.

1355
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,180
You also did.

1356
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:02,180
Girl,

1357
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:04,180
you scared me the other day

1358
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,180
when I saw what you did

1359
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,180
to your toy

1360
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,180
on the ritual.

1361
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,180
I was like,

1362
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:10,180
oh,

1363
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:11,180
okay.

1364
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,180
And I'm going to tell you guys right now,

1365
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:15,180
you pin pals out there.

1366
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:17,180
You're fucked, bro.

1367
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:19,180
You're never getting rid of her.

1368
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:21,180
Some of them were like,

1369
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,180
why does my penis hurt now?

1370
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:29,920
You did like some mass casting and I'm not even you guys are cooked. I'm so sorry

1371
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:37,860
Yeah, you're gonna be dreaming of her you're gonna be oh man, you are gonna be madly in love with Amy if you're not

1372
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:41,740
We have a question oh

1373
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:51,020
If you could spend a day in she bees be the awesome dungeon, what would you let she be do to you?

1374
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:58,380
Anything she wants to I would probably I'll tell you what I'll do to each of you

1375
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:09,860
For Azura, I'd probably strap her down to something and get one of those automatic toys

1376
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:14,300
Just a whale on her and just walk away and be like have fun

1377
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,100
for Amy

1378
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,700
I

1379
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:38,100
For Amy I mean Amy loves to be loved and cherished and I would whisper sweet nothings to her while I punch her into the gut

1380
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:42,780
And then I'd also be strapping something to her

1381
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:50,580
Bottom half so that she can buzz with excitement as I do so and then for

1382
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,300
Then for Mercy

1383
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,740
Mercy you said you like grik, right

1384
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:06,780
You know I might do like knife play mercy

1385
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:15,460
Well that you know we do something with that I'm not gonna elaborate

1386
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:26,180
I

1387
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:29,980
Definitely get some shabari ropes on her

1388
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:34,140
I feel like she would like getting a taste of her own medicine

1389
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,740
What she does to her son?

1390
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:39,140
She's back. Hold on. I gotta move

1391
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,540
Are you okay?

1392
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:51,740
What do you mean is this what you want

1393
01:05:53,180 --> 01:06:00,460
You're not entertained. I can't even like there's like a constant like notification pop popping up. That's weird

1394
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:05,860
Not the technical difficulties even

1395
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,580
Please

1396
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:18,740
Please this won't go away. I keep pressing. Okay, and it won't go away. What program?

1397
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,500
To the

1398
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,100
Yeah

1399
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:33,220
What's it there or so I sense it in general

1400
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:38,140
Doing mid mid

1401
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,700
It won't go away

1402
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:45,700
No, we're that it cuz you're obviously connected

1403
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,660
There's fighting for her life. Okay. Okay

1404
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:58,780
Hypothetically if VLR had an HR department, who would be the best HR person

1405
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:04,540
Out of all of us, I guess out of all of us

1406
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,860
Maybe mercy

1407
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,900
probably me I

1408
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,380
Feel like we need definitely not strongy

1409
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:15,380
Definitely

1410
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,220
What what me argue your reasoning why you

1411
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:25,740
I'm gonna be bossy and I'm gonna tell you guys you can't do things

1412
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:33,360
Because I have some HR experience I would say myself

1413
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:40,020
Experience and not even lower wise just like me

1414
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:45,980
So I say myself, but I think like that we don't have HR because we don't fucking need one

1415
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:47,900
Yeah

1416
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,900
We're all we're all adults

1417
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:53,620
Sex pest allocation

1418
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:57,380
Johnny's not beating the sex Johnny would be it would get sent to HR

1419
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:01,700
Oh, yeah, he would constantly be going to HR from from complaints. Oh

1420
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:04,980
Somebody asked what would

1421
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:11,940
What would we each do to each other with our respective niches just didn't like kind of in the same frame that I did if you guys were in my dungeon

1422
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:16,620
Okay, I guess just trap all of you

1423
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,900
Trap trap trap trap trap trap all of you

1424
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:26,340
I'll make you all

1425
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:32,860
My happy happily ever after life and if you ever deviate from it, it's over

1426
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:36,620
Yeah, but like like like like naughty

1427
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:54,940
Oh, she's probably starting

1428
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:01,860
I guess I guess, you know, I guess, you know

1429
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:04,860
Maybe a little maybe if I could be a little forceful

1430
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:14,300
You're so cute about it, I guess if I could be a little bit forceful

1431
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:20,420
She says as she shoves something up our asses

1432
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,700
I wouldn't mind

1433
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,700
Yeah

1434
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,700
There's just a disembodied voice

1435
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:39,540
You know, I might I might I might like hold your hand

1436
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:49,420
Oh, you're gonna talk talk me through it. You know, yeah, and and be like so gentle. Oh, maybe even kiss me on the cheek a little bit

1437
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:52,220
Yeah, kiss on the cheek and pat your head a

1438
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:55,180
Lot of eye contact

1439
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,700
As I look at your one eye

1440
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,900
I can take it off

1441
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:16,460
We're getting really hot in here. Yeah, I'm feeling a bit toasty

1442
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,620
Now like you have like an actual sweat drop

1443
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:28,420
She's turning down. Yeah

1444
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:35,580
Amy, what about you? Okay, I'll go one by one. What if I was your big sister?

1445
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:44,100
What would you do to your big sister? I'll start with Mercy. I want to hear Mercy's reaction. Okay

1446
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,900
Mercy, you know, I feel like

1447
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:53,340
Mercy I feel like I would I would blindfold her and

1448
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:54,740
and

1449
01:10:54,740 --> 01:11:02,540
I would maybe maybe I would use some some tools that she's familiar with on her and I'd maybe make her guess what I'm using

1450
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:09,420
Does she get punished if she guesses wrong? Oh, of course she does

1451
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,460
Oh

1452
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:35,100
For she be I feel like I feel like some some office role play would be fun. Maybe maybe I could be like a

1453
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,420
My little secretary. Yeah, you're a little secretary

1454
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:43,740
And I'll accidentally drop some paperwork on on the ground

1455
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,500
Then dover slowly you better be wearing a skirt

1456
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:54,220
I'll be wearing a skirt. Maybe not something underneath the skirt though. Oh

1457
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:58,060
I'm getting I'm getting real excited right now

1458
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:09,060
I'm here. I'm I'm like if you check mine like my

1459
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:12,260
My uh

1460
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:17,380
My strum my stream you see I'm like everything's fine. I fixed it

1461
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:23,340
Yeah, I'm cutting out for me. It's okay. I can hear you Azura. Yeah, you're fine. Yeah, you're fine. Yeah

1462
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:26,140
Am I am I there for everyone else?

1463
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:40,340
Why would you do Azura that's a hard one

1464
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:46,020
I feel like for Azura, I'd actually like to court her first a little take her to a nice dinner

1465
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:52,140
I would not stand stand her up at the dinner. I would I would I would drive her there

1466
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,140
I would pick her up from her house and

1467
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:00,580
And then afterwards I don't believe that you can drive but

1468
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:09,740
And then afterwards I would I would maybe you know have prepared some candles and some petals on the bed

1469
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:12,860
I'll take it real slow and nice with Azura

1470
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:15,540
Okay, all right

1471
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:19,780
Wait, wait, can I can I get a little bit of that niceness, too?

1472
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:24,180
Everybody wants to be pampered

1473
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:28,220
Not me oh

1474
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:32,740
Oh, oh, I don't want to be pampered

1475
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,260
Well, maybe

1476
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:50,220
Because if anything I'm definitely not going to be nice to you guys

1477
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:11,580
Yeah, don't worry about it. She just needs a couple of love taps every now and then

1478
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:15,100
She didn't say she doesn't want to be treated gently, I guess

1479
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:22,780
But I don't think I'd be very gentle with any of you

1480
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:35,020
I want to be ungodly things to mercy. Yeah, I'll sit in the cook chair to watch that

1481
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:38,020
I

1482
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:46,300
Want to hold her down. I want to see her make all the

1483
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,620
She'll make you know, she's very expressive. So, you know, she'll make faces I

1484
01:14:55,140 --> 01:15:01,540
Want to make her draw oh my god, and I want her to scream

1485
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:07,020
I

1486
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:11,700
Got a shift my legs a little bit. What's going on?

1487
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:27,460
Mercy has left

1488
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,300
Simply deceased

1489
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:39,700
Oh my god, oh my god

1490
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:53,980
I love I love eliciting reactions from mercy

1491
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:07,940
You mean eat out

1492
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,340
On my tongue

1493
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:23,180
What did you just say

1494
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:30,560
Repeat it say it again speak up

1495
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:38,660
Big and twirl mercy around on my tongue

1496
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:44,780
You could see my actual face right now

1497
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,660
What would you do in me? Oh, yeah, I

1498
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,880
I

1499
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:05,860
Want to spank you I feel like you're like the biggest brat ever

1500
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:12,180
And you deserve to get spanked. You need to behave bad and me

1501
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:22,260
To those poor humans you need to be spanked

1502
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:31,180
I

1503
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,460
Wouldn't chat is agreeing with you

1504
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:41,820
Yeah, definitely emmy emmy's definitely the the brat and I see has become the princess

1505
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:46,020
It's cute. I love I like the switch

1506
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,880
Azura out doming she be confirmed. Listen

1507
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:58,500
Don't get it twisted. No, he's being a mom disciplining you. Yeah, he's being like she's mine has no love behind

1508
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:04,380
Unless I say so I'd add love behind it and I would she be

1509
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:13,420
Me no, I mean Azura would fight for dominance we would we would I have a lot of fun doing it

1510
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:27,140
She's gone for a jog

1511
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,580
All right

1512
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:38,580
Sorry, I'm cool. Oh good. Oh good. Yeah, I understand

1513
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:43,980
That's like so so effective. It's her voice

1514
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,980
I

1515
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:58,780
Want to see what she looks like died up. I mean, we're already looking at her

1516
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:00,780
She's

1517
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:15,940
Too spicy for you two right now. Okay. Um, do you have any other questions? I

1518
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:22,380
Saw someone ask a question, but it might be too much for YouTube. I don't know. Let me look for it again

1519
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:30,780
Oh

1520
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:42,740
Like our hair moves

1521
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:47,880
Here's a question. I'll copy and paste it to chat and you guys can let me know if you're okay with answering that

1522
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,080
Okay, okay

1523
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:55,680
I would say

1524
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:02,480
Me I can tell you that it's not me. I'd say it's me

1525
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,600
She matches your freak I

1526
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,960
Think it's definitely not me. I'm so I'm so vanilla. I'm sorry out of everybody. It's straw knee

1527
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:31,660
Yeah, I feel like it would be a zero a zero. What does a zero own? That's so exotic. I don't know but I just she's hiding

1528
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:58,600
Okay, okay, but you're fighting so much again. Yeah, I know that's why I'm like what she has a whole closet full

1529
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,600
I assure you

1530
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:09,960
I guess me on the on on the outside, but is there a deep down

1531
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,880
She be owns it

1532
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:20,360
As there is deflecting, you know, I don't know what you're talking about

1533
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,200
I am the goddess of the lore

1534
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,680
I am an angel

1535
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,120
Fallen angel

1536
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,600
Yeah, I don't I don't think there's anything angelic about this goddess

1537
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:49,080
What are their questions you guys see any questions?

1538
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,480
I'm surprised the yandere has the weakest sense

1539
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,360
I don't know what they mean by sets, but like I think that's

1540
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:06,080
They said sets like S E T S like exercise sets like at the gym

1541
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,760
toy sets

1542
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,840
I have snoopy parents

1543
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:18,200
That's true. My mom does the same thing every time she comes over

1544
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:23,480
She opens my fucking closet and goes through my clothes because she's like oh did you buy any new clothes and

1545
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:27,520
Literally right behind my clothes in my closets is my box full of sex

1546
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:35,000
I'm like, oh my god, please don't look at that box. Please don't notice the box

1547
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:48,160
Honestly, I'm very nosy. I'm very vanilla. It's like if something looks too scary. I'm just like

1548
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:57,080
I think I really am the most exploratory up in here. Yeah, you're she's silent, but deadly

1549
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:03,040
She's gonna talk about it. She's just show it off. But like a zero is a killer. I'll tell you that I

1550
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,040
I

1551
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:10,680
Don't care. I don't let my mom go through any of my things. Oh fight her. Oh

1552
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:15,800
You got stuff to hide. Oh, you have stuff to hide. I

1553
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,440
Have like a bunch of outfits like

1554
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,120
Collars have like

1555
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:28,680
Sets I have like a closet full. I don't let my mom go on any of my stuff

1556
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,320
Oh, and then she'll just take it out and then she'll be like

1557
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,480
And I'm like

1558
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:44,960
So go and she'll tell people so even probably take a picture in and make fun of me

1559
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,840
Oh my god, everybody look my daughter fucks

1560
01:23:55,720 --> 01:24:02,000
Even I was doing like a little cosplay she came into my room one time because I forgot to lock the door and then she went out

1561
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:06,720
Because she had guessed over and she went out and she was like, oh my god

1562
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:12,880
She's doing cosplay come come show them come show them for I was like in the most skimpiest shit

1563
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:15,400
You don't understand

1564
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,040
What were you wearing

1565
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
A

1566
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:38,360
YouTube doesn't like this one. I don't think we should talk about that

1567
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:51,280
Obviously show us just tell us what the new cosplay does. Mm-hmm. Don't show us. It's okay. Um, okay, let me see if I have any questions

1568
01:24:54,680 --> 01:25:00,120
Everybody's just freaking out because of Zara everyone's saying no wonder you press so hard on

1569
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Yeah

1570
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:14,160
Yeah, I have no privacy, I have no privacy so everything I have is like very

1571
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,080
Small

1572
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:28,800
Anyone breath any of us broke the law. Yeah, I walked before

1573
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:32,560
I broke the law. What did you do?

1574
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:34,960
public

1575
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:38,240
What's it called public exposure? She probably was like

1576
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,040
herself in the woods

1577
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,440
Probably did leave herself on the chain

1578
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:52,500
I've never broken the law I've gone spoken to because I've broken to

1579
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,700
An abandoned mansion before with my friends

1580
01:25:56,700 --> 01:26:01,100
Oh, that's so fine because there's one right near my like high school graduation party

1581
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:06,260
So I was literally like, oh, what the fuck's this and we just wanted it was cool. Then we got scolded but that was like

1582
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:08,820
I was like 17

1583
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:12,140
Think of some laws I broke I drove

1584
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:16,100
Faster than speed limit, but did you get caught?

1585
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:18,220
No

1586
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:19,820
It doesn't count

1587
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,780
J walked across the street

1588
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:35,300
What's the favorite audio you've recorded so far I

1589
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:43,980
Likeed my armpit audio the most because I feel like I'm not really good at acting subby

1590
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:49,780
I feel like my audio is where I act more dominant. I feel more comfortable. So that's my favorite

1591
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:54,380
When were you fucking lick the sweat off of my armpit while you're dorking it?

1592
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,500
I like the Amazonian one

1593
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:02,820
Oh

1594
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:04,820
The what?

1595
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:05,820
Amazonian

1596
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:07,820
Oh my

1597
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:09,820
Is that an upcoming one?

1598
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:12,820

01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:42,820
Which is probably

1607
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:46,820
The second one that came out was my first one

1608
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:52,820
I'm surprised I'm not burping as much as you guys in this video

1609
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:09,820

01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:53,260
It's a fanzly endurance stream

1633
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:59,460
Wait, let me see

1634
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:03,980
What do you get it?

1635
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:10,180
No, hold on. Let me just read it it but like you do it

1636
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:17,300
Like oh back-to-back. Oh it keeps going. I understand that feeling. I know exactly what you're talking about

1637
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:20,740
Even if you have only ones it's not like if you're doing it multiple

1638
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:24,300
I don't know

1639
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:28,900
I think she means the entire time the entire time the entire

1640
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:31,780
You do it once and then just continues

1641
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:46,300
She's good the entire day happen. I have that happen before I am

1642
01:30:47,660 --> 01:30:53,060
What's the longest what's the longest one of yours have lasted? Oh, I don't know I

1643
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:56,180
Say for me like two minutes

1644
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:58,500
Yeah

1645
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:07,220
That can't be humanly possible

1646
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:16,140
No, they're having me question my own body. I'm confused

1647
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:22,660
No, I just never I I've never experienced that

1648
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:29,940
Yeah, I mean either like being high but a different kind of high like post not clarity or whatever, but like

1649
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:41,540
Like the jitters and you you keep it for quite at some time because I understand like sensitivity

1650
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:43,540
Yeah, afterwards and like continuing

1651
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:58,660
There's just like yeah, I constantly have a vibrate in my panties and that's how I do it

1652
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:04,820
She went to heaven and stayed there

1653
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:13,060
Yeah, I feel bad for guys they can't experience like a lot maybe a max like maybe like three

1654
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:15,060
Mm-hmm

1655
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:21,380
I must suck sucks to be a man can't relate

1656
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:31,620
Katora supremacy. I'm actually one more. I I I actually wish I had a I had one

1657
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:37,700
Yeah, you why I would just like to stick it in things

1658
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:42,500
I'd like to stack donuts on it. Yeah

1659
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:45,300
I want one

1660
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:47,300
I'm so jealous like

1661
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:53,700
The bliss of just having one and then no like extreme mess. You could put it places

1662
01:32:54,500 --> 01:33:00,180
No, you could do so much with it and I think I might hook up that the sensitivity

1663
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:06,820
But our sensitivity is more than that

1664
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:11,220
That's not true. Not unless you go for the g spot

1665
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:14,180
Wait, oh you want to put it in the butt

1666
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:27,620

1672
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:05,860

1675
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:22,260

01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:45,860
I have another question, but it's also really spicy. I don't know how far you guys want to go with the spicy questions

1696
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:49,540
Because that's what that's what my chat. That's all my chat's asking

01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:53,860
But you do but you do why not like it. I don't care

1698
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:57,460
There's my next question from chat

1699
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:05,780
I'll delete the last one so that there's no proof at the same time at the same time. I would say three

Then my hands get full

1717
01:36:58,580 --> 01:37:00,580
It's a lot of juggling

1718
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:05,940
Every time I talk to these violour girls, I feel like I'm the most vanilla

1719
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:12,180
And you can do that. That's okay. That's okay. You never put multiple bullets in

1720
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:15,300
Multiple bullets. No, you have more than one

1721
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:19,460

01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:45,060
That's a lot

She doesn't want to be in a room with all of us

1737
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:33,300
I want to be in the room with mercy. I can't wait to do an off collab

Tired of the laugh with your color
