My f U C A G H E C L E, that I worked so hard to make clan this one working.

10
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,200
Okay, there is real chat.

11
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,000
Hello, thank you for coming from Shibhi's...

12
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,820
I'm not sure if that chat is working completely correctly either,

13
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:05,360
but thank you for coming from Shibi's stream, how was it! I was there too.

That's like a lot for a poor Canadian like me.

23
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
So yeah.

24
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:30,160
Alright, the next thing on my list is...

25
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Right, for those who listen to the loot audio, give me feedback.

26
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
I want feedback.

27
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,160
Like, like, like, like, uh...

28
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,160
Like, hurt my feelings.

29
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,160
Like literally, if you didn't like it, like tell me.

30
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,160
Like, tell me what was wrong with it, you know?

31
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Did we miss the Canadian accent?

32
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
I don't think I have a Canadian accent.

33
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
It was my French.

34
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,160
My French is very like...

35
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,160
My French is very Canadian.

36
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:02,160
I went to a French school, like, up until college.

37
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Yeah.

38
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Is my music on?

39
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
It is.

40
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,160
I was enrolled in a French school since birth until I went to college.

41
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,160
And then I went to an English college.

42
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Did you have a Patreon as well?

43
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
Yes, we do.

44
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
It's in the description.

45
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
There was an audio.

46
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
Bro, you guys don't know?

47
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
What the hell?

48
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
It was not French immersion.

49
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
It was not French immersion.

50
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
It was fully French.

51
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
We did everything in French at that school.

52
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,160
All the teachers spoke French to us.

53
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
I kind of hated it.

54
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
But you know, whatever.

55
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
Now I learned French.

56
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,160
Ow.

57
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,160
I'm sipping on some tea for my throat.

58
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
It was helpful.

59
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
Okay, hold on.

60
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
I'm scrolling up so I can see if anyone...

61
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
Why can't I scroll up?

62
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Fucking YouTube chat.

63
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
I had nothing to say about it.

64
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
It was my first ASMR.

65
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
Oh.

66
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
I think your accent is cute.

67
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
Oh, thank you.

68
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,160
Okay, well, if you have complaints...

69
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
I don't know.

70
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Send me a marshmallow.

71
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Tell me, okay?

72
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Is the delay high?

73
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
The delay for chat might be high.

74
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
What kind of tea?

75
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
It's raspberry tea.

76
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Um...

77
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Oh my god.

78
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
What else?

79
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
What else?

80
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Okay.

81
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
Next I have some slides.

82
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Yup.

83
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
Didn't even know there was a voice?

84
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
What voice?

85
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
Voice?

86
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Thank you for all the support that we've received, by the way, too.

87
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
I was so surprised.

88
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,160
I thought there was going to be like 500 people at the debut.

89
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,160
And we had like 2,000 something.

90
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
I was like, damn.

91
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
I was not expecting that.

92
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,160
I really appreciate that you guys showed up.

93
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
I'm not always going to be like...

94
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,160
I'm not always going to be super high energy during streams,

95
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
but I'm also not always going to be super low energy.

96
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
It just depends on the day.

97
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
And today is a sick day.

98
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
Right, so I have some slides to show you.

99
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
How do I present these?

100
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Okay.

101
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
Present.

102
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
All right.

103
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Okay.

104
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
I gotta go back to old chat.

105
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Okay, there we go.

106
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
Um...

107
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Nope, that's the wrong one.

108
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
Nope, that's also the wrong one.

109
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Okay, okay.

110
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
I'm figuring it out.

111
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,160
I'm figuring it out.

112
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,160
One moment, please.

113
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
Window capture.

114
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
Sure.

115
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
There it is.

116
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
All right.

117
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Okay.

118
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,160
Oh.

119
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
I hope I don't crop anything out.

120
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
There's my...

121
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Maybe I should even put it a little higher up

122
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,160
because chat is kind of covering it.

123
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,160
Here's my 2.0 slides.

124
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,160
So I will mostly talk about myself and then...

125
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,160
And then maybe we can talk about you at the end.

126
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
We'll see, we'll see.

127
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
And I'll probably answer marshmallow questions too

128
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
at the end.

129
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,160
So right, here is the 2.0.

130
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Emmy's list of very important info.

131
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Memorize it all.

132
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,160
You're gonna get tested on it at the end.

133
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
Next.

134
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Okay.

135
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Ignore the fact that I'm using camera.

136
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
We're pro streamers.

137
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
Oh, hi, Mercy.

138
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Good, good, good.

139
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
Remember it all.

140
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
Okay.

141
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
Who is Emmy?

142
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
What?

143
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
What?

144
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,160
Emmy was living.

145
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Right.

146
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
Okay.

147
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Full paw and V-tubing, I know.

148
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Right, so, uh,

149
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,160
Vealer have allowed us to be

150
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,160
open about our PLs.

151
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,160
Obviously, don't go and bother the other girls

152
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
about theirs.

153
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
If they don't want to say it,

154
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
they don't have to say it, you know?

155
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,160
If they want to keep it private, that's okay.

156
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,160
I am not keeping it private

157
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
because a lot of you already know.

158
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Right, yeah.

159
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,160
And also, my voice is pretty recognizable.

160
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,160
So, like,

161
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
possible lover.

162
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
No, it means past life.

163
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
Right, yeah.

164
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
My voice is really recognizable.

165
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
So, to me, it's like,

166
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
what's the point?

167
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Unless I had, like, you know,

168
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
some closets in my,

169
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,160
some skeletons in my closet to hide.

170
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
I don't, but,

171
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,160
you know, if you do, I understand

172
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
if you want to hide your past account,

173
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
but I'm not going to do that.

174
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
Like, and,

175
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
God, I'm so scattered brain.

176
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
Like, in terms of V-tubers

177
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
who join companies doing that,

178
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
it's okay, like,

179
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
I don't judge the ones who hide it,

180
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,160
but I didn't want to hide it.

181
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
So, yeah.

182
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Go watch my other content.

183
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,160
It's really good, and I like it,

184
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
so I hope you will also like it.

185
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Who is living?

186
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
You just search Liberty on YouTube.

187
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Yeah.

188
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Just how, the way I spelled it here,

189
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
you can just search that,

190
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,160
and if you want to go watch the other content.

191
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Oh my God, am I running out of tea already?

192
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
I am.

193
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
Yes, it's great to be back.

194
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
It was so fucking hard.

195
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Staying away from you,

196
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
you don't fucking understand.

197
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
You don't understand.

198
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
You don't understand how hard it was

199
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
to not stream.

200
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
God, I'm getting voice cracks.

201
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,160
To not stream.

202
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
To not tweet.

203
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
To not make any videos,

204
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,160
because I had to work on viewer stuff.

205
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
It was killing me, bro.

206
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,160
But I'm really happy to be back now,

207
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
and I'm really happy to be able

208
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,160
to continue making content for you guys

209
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
with the support of viewer.

210
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
And the other girls too.

211
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,160
Go support the other girls too.

212
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Right, so,

213
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
man,

214
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,160
I'm kind of covering my own,

215
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,160
I'm kind of covering my own thing here.

216
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Oh fuck, I'm locked.

217
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,160
Right.

218
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
So don't,

219
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
don't go on my old channel

220
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
and be like,

221
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
guys, I found her,

222
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
she's gonna be, she's gonna be,

223
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
go subscribe.

224
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Don't do that.

225
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
I will announce it myself.

226
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
So you don't have to do that.

227
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Okay, don't even worry about it.

228
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
Don't go, don't go reading the other channel

229
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
and being like,

230
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
I found her,

231
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
I will do that for you, okay?

232
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,160
I'll make an announcement.

233
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,160
When YouTube stops calling our subscribers,

234
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,160
because I don't want to make an announcement,

235
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,160
and then everyone who comes and subscribes

236
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
gets cold.

237
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
That's like,

238
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
that's annoying.

239
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Sorry, let me, let me try to read chat.

240
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
Pretty cool that you can make loot content,

241
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
though obviously you have to do other stuff on,

242
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,160
sites other than YouTube.

243
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Oh, what do you mean we have to do other stuff?

244
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
We don't have to do anything on,

245
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
on any other sites other than YouTube.

246
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
Unless you're talking about Patreon content,

247
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,160
but we signed up knowing that we had to do that.

248
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,160
You know someone stupid enough to do that anyways?

249
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
Yes,

250
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
I know multiple people stupid enough to do that.

251
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
Okay.

252
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Okay.

253
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
All right.

254
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Conclusion, good company, I appreciate that.

255
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Yeah.

256
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
Next slide.

257
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
Next slide, where's my slides?

258
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Okay, there's my slides.

259
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,160
All right, stuff I want to mention.

260
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
Five out of ten?

261
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
That was, that was like, at least a six out of ten.

262
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Right.

263
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
I want to do fanzly streams eventually.

264
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,160
But we will have to wait until around July.

265
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
Maybe more, I don't, I don't know.

266
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,160
But at least July,

267
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
because I think Strani said like,

268
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,160
oh, we have to establish ourselves on YouTube first.

269
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Yeah, they're very supportive of the talents.

270
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
That's why I joined.

271
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
Next point.

272
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
I'm a little bit mentally ill,

273
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
but we're not going to talk about it.

274
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,160
And I will never bring it up to you.

275
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Just know if I do some wax shit,

276
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,160
or if you see some wax shit, you know.

277
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
C'est la vie.

278
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Oh yeah, right.

279
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,160
Okay, so I know my shtick is like,

280
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
cis con, right?

281
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,160
A sister con,

282
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
what does con mean?

283
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,160
Consensual convention.

284
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
Blue Twitch?

285
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
Oh, you mean fanzly?

286
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Brocon, whatever.

287
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
Oh, complex.

288
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Complex.

289
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,160
What does it end with an N if it means complex?

290
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Okay, well.

291
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,160
Yeah, I know my little shtick here is cis con.

292
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,160
My rats are fighting in the background.

293
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Oh my god.

294
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
Did you hear that?

295
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,160
Okay, you hear that?

296
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Okay, if I hear that again,

297
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
I might have to BRB to separate them.

298
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,160
I'm trying to introduce some new babies to my adults,

299
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,160
and they're kind of not getting along.

300
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
Oh my fucking god.

301
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,160
Alright.

302
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
What's their names?

303
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
You'll see them soon.

304
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
In handcams.

305
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,160
Right, so,

306
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,160
I know that my whole shtick is like brocon cis con,

307
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,160
but unfortunately to disappoint you,

308
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
we can't do that on Patreon.

309
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
I don't even think we can do that on fanzly either.

310
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
We have to abide by their TOS.

311
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,160
Yeah, I know that might disappoint some of you,

312
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
and you might be like,

313
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
oh well why don't you go to this other platform

314
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
that does allow that stuff.

315
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,160
You know, the shirt that we could,

316
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,160
but also we're trying to stick to the bigger platforms

317
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,160
that a lot of people have access to

318
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,160
and a lot of people know about.

319
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,160
It's not very smart to go streaming

320
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,160
on smaller platforms,

321
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,160
because then you're just making your...

322
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
Oh god, I'm having a brain fart.

323
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
When we have the option for a bigger platform,

324
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
let's just try that first, right?

325
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
Big brain, right? Accessibility, yes, yes, yes.

326
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Accessibility equals growth.

327
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
That's what I mean.

328
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,160
Yeah, you don't want to

329
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,160
shoot yourself in the foot right from the start, you know?

330
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Let's just wait until we get banned first,

331
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
and then we can go to those platforms.

332
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,160
I'm just kidding, don't ban us, please.

333
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,160
Right, my IRL goals, I have real life goals,

334
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,160
because I'm actually, you know, not...

335
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,160
I'm only part-time anime girl on the internet.

336
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,160
My real life goals is...

337
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,160
I want to move into an apartment with air conditioning.

338
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,160
I want to move into an apartment with air conditioning

339
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,160
because it's summer right now, and...

340
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,160
If something is allowed on Fancy, but not on Patreon,

341
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,160
you can get banned from Patreon for doing it on Fancy.

342
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,160
Shit, yeah.

343
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,160
So, no Bokon, I guess, on Fancy.

344
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Yeah, I don't have air conditioning.

345
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,160
A lot of apartments don't come with air conditioning,

346
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,160
so I want to move to one that does

347
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,160
because it's going to be summer soon,

348
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,160
and if I, you know,

349
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,160
if I am able to do that,

350
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,160
that helps me be able to stream longer,

351
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,160
and it helps me be able to make more content

352
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,160
because I will be comfortable during the summer,

353
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,160
because I have to keep my stream short for now

354
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,160
because I can't stream for long hours in the heat without AC.

355
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
So, yeah.

356
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
What did GB say?

357
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Scroll up.

358
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Pomf?

359
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,160
Yeah, some people said pomf.

360
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,160
Yeah, some people said pomf.

361
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
I don't know if we'll go there.

362
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
Right, yeah.

363
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,160
Next goal is I want to get a big girl microphone.

364
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,160
I feel like I'm using such a newbie microphone right now.

365
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
I'm using the HyperX,

366
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,160
and I don't know, I'm sure the quality is okay.

367
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,160
But I want to get like a really professional one, yeah.

368
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Something expensive,

369
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
something I can waste my money on.

370
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,160
It sounds good.

371
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
Yeah, I'm sure the quality is good,

372
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
but I want something like,

373
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,160
I want a big girl mic

374
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
with lots of cords

375
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,160
to tie you up with.

376
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Next, I want to,

377
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
I want to be able to get a dishwasher

378
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,160
and a washing machine

379
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,160
and a dryer for clothes.

380
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,160
I feel like these goals should be pretty realistic.

381
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
I feel like I should be able to get these things.

382
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,160
So, I'm so excited to tweet

383
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
a picture of my new washing machine

384
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,160
and to be like, guys!

385
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,160
I got a washing machine!

386
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Wait, we're skipping number three?

387
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
Oh, be mentally stable, yeah, that too.

388
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
I want to do that too.

389
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,160
Wait, what's she be stick?

390
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,160
Do you live in a cardboard box?

391
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,160
No, I live in an apartment,

392
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,160
but it doesn't really have amenities

393
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,160
because it's not really an apartment.

394
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
Okay.

395
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
All right.

396
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,160
And the last one is not visible

397
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,160
because the chat is covering it.

398
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,160
I'll be able to afford your membership.

399
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,160
I used to be really, really athletic,

400
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,160
which is crazy to say because now I'm not.

401
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,160
But I want to go back to those days.

402
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,160
I mentioned before that I won a gymnastics award.

403
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Yeah, I used to like do gymnastics.

404
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,160
I don't know if I'll ever go back,

405
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,160
but I want to do something athletic

406
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
because it was fun.

407
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,160
Yeah, fat-shaming and chat?

408
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
What?

409
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,160
Who's fat-shaming and chat?

410
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,160
The only one around here that's allowed to fat-shame is me.

411
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
I'm kidding.

412
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,160
I won't be fat-shaming anyone.

413
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Right.

414
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
Next.

415
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,160
What does Imi like under the shats?

416
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
I don't know.

417
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
Okay.

418
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,160
Let me know if I'm being too rude too quickly.

419
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,160
I don't know how quickly we want to advance here, but...

420
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Will there be some content on YouTube to a lesser extent?

421
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,160
I have to consult Strani for that.

422
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,160
I don't know what YouTube allows.

423
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,160
I would get bonked all the time on YouTube in the past.

424
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,160
I'm still getting bonked to this day on YouTube.

425
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
Guys, guys, I...

426
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,160
You know how YouTube is like removing ear-licking content

427
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,160
and deleting people's channels for ear-licking content?

428
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
But I still have ear-licking content up.

429
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
I mean, what YouTube execs?

430
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,160
No, I would never do ear-licking content.

431
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
I don't do that.

432
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Wait, wait, wait.

433
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
So in the...

434
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,160
In the what?

435
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
In the trailer,

436
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,160
my voice line was like,

437
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,160
what, you've never seen a masochistic bracket before?

438
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Which to me is kind of a silly trailer line,

439
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,160
but Strani sent it to me and I was like, whatever, I'll do it.

440
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,160
So yeah, here's all my masochistic tendencies.

441
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,160
I won't go too in-depth, but I'm also a sadist.

442
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,160
So anything you see here, like, fuck, it goes both ways, you know?

443
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
What's Painplay? Exactly what it sounds like.

444
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,160
If you don't know what Painplay is, then what are you doing here?

445
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Weren't you guys just in Shibi's chat? Shouldn't you know?

446
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
Yeah, yandere?

447
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
Okay.

448
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,160
God, I really am covering everything, aren't I?

449
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,160
I'm sorry for coughing in your ear.

450
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
All right, so yandere, right.

451
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Okay, I know it's Mercy's job.

452
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
I won't steal her job.

453
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,160
I won't be like, Senpai, you're gonna fucking...

454
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,160
You're gonna eat my ass tonight, right Senpai?

455
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,160
Huh?

456
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,160
I'll tie you down in my basement and force you to sit on you.

457
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,160
No.

458
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,160
I'm not gonna...

459
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,160
Why am I so tiny now?

460
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
I'm not gonna steal her thing, okay?

461
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,160
That's her thing.

462
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:20,160
But you wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me.

463
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:29,160
Okay, I'm not a Swiftie, but I've been obsessed with that sort of content since seventh grade.

464
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
You can't rip it out of me, okay?

465
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,160
I consume an unhealthy amount of that sort of content.

466
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,160
Someone was able to find all of the...

467
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,160
All of the hentai I had put on my coffee table from my debut.

468
00:24:50,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Just from the really shitty Minecraft pixelated tiny little images I had put up.

469
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
They found every single one.

470
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:08,160
So if you wanna go into the debut comment section and read what I like,

471
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,160
go ahead, but I can't say here probably.

472
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,160
Yeah, yeah, I've been...

473
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
I think...

474
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
Oh fuck.

475
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
I can't say how long I've been obsessed with it.

476
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
I think I really did.

477
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
Oh, whatever.

478
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,160
I've been obsessed with it for way too long.

479
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,160
Longer than some of you Zoomers might be alive for.

480
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,160
Oh yeah, the red goo that comes out of your body.

481
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Peeling skin.

482
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
Peeling skin is like really satisfying.

483
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,160
I'm not a fucking hag.

484
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,160
You'll be surprised I'm not a hag.

485
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,160
We do have hags though if you want them.

486
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
Yeah, peeling skin.

487
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,160
Okay, my favorite thing about peeling skin.

488
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,160
Not just on your lips, cause also on your lips and on my lips on...

489
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,160
On your lips, from my lips, whatever.

490
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,160
But also just in general like scabs.

491
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,160
I really like to pick sc...

492
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,160
Oh, I got a cough.

493
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
Okay.

494
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Let me drink some water.

495
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
Right.

496
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
I really...

497
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:31,160
My favorite thing ever is when you're peeling a scab and it makes like a ripping sound.

498
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:36,160
I don't know if you've ever experienced that cause I'm sure none of you...

499
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,160
I'm sure not everyone here likes to pick scabs.

500
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,160
But I love it when you can hear the skin rip.

501
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
That's my favorite thing ever.

502
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,160
And also when you can feel the skin rip, but yeah.

503
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,160
Or talking like dead skin?

504
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,160
Well like, you know, when your lips are dry they start to peel.

505
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,160
How big of a scab are you picking? Any fucking size.

506
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,160
The bigger the better.

507
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
It's audible? It is.

508
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,160
If you get a big enough one.

509
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,160
I like popping pim...

510
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
Oh, there's a car outside.

511
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,160
I like popping pimples too.

512
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:17,160
That's satisfying too, but I feel like scabs are better cause they...

513
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,160
They goo.

514
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,160
They goo.

515
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
They goo red.

516
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,160
Spanking and chunking.

517
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
I am a switch.

518
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,160
I gotta move it for you.

519
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,160
Imi does not read much hentai.

520
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,160
I mostly read dirty books.

521
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,160
But if you have a recommendation, I've been trying to read...

522
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,160
Hold on, I gotta cough again.

523
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
I'm a Nintendo switch.

524
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,160
I've been trying to read at least one recommendation from...

525
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,160
Cause a lot of you have been sending full on lists of a bunch of them.

526
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,160
I can't read all of those.

527
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,160
But I try to read one at least from each one.

528
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Any favorite tags?

529
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
The ones here!

530
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,160
These ones!

531
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,160
My neighbors are being really loud downstairs.

532
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Genuine love and affection.

533
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
Yeah, I just want someone to love me.

534
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
That's my ultimate kink.

535
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,160
Non...

536
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Complex.

537
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,160
Also, anything you're into...

538
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,160
If you presented the right way to me,

539
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,160
then I'll probably be into it too.

540
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
Yeah.

541
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,160
Next slide.

542
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,160
What does Imi not like under the shats?

543
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Right, right.

544
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Who loves the most degenerative kinks?

545
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
I know.

546
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
I know that's asking a lot.

547
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,160
I know, I'm really freaky when it comes to that.

548
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,160
Okay, so all of the below stuff I am fine with when it comes to fan art.

549
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,160
This only pertains to elude marshmallows

550
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,160
or just how we interact with each other in general.

551
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Right.

552
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,160
I bet you like hand holding.

553
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,160
Don't you, you little freak?

554
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,160
I hope you can't hear the dog barking.

555
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Let's not my dog either.

556
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,160
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

557
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
Great.

558
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Death or necrophilia.

559
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,160
I may have threatened to have...

560
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,160
gex with your dead body in a past audio.

561
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,160
But I'm not actually into it and please do not do...

562
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,160
I mean, do not send any weird necrophilia stuff to me.

563
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
I know, I know we're freaky here,

564
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
but let's not go that far, okay?

565
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,160
Let's not go that far.

566
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
Right, I'm all about love.

567
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:20,160
So I'm uncomfortable with any sort of pain play stuff if it's not loving.

568
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,160
Because, you know, I'm just freaky like that.

569
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,160
It's got to be loving.

570
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Do not fuck the dead body.

571
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
Actually, right, right, right.

572
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
Okay, I'm okay with cutesy stuff.

573
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,160
I really like cutesy stuff.

574
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,160
Or like...

575
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,160
Or like...

576
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,160
You mean freak?

577
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
You guys are so funny.

578
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,160
Okay, I'm like, I'm okay with cutesy stuff.

579
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,160
Or like, I didn't know that touching a peepee makes it...

580
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
But I don't go Google Gaga.

581
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
I don't go into that territory, so...

582
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Go to AC.

583
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Yeah, if you're into that, she will...

584
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,160
She will satisfy you.

585
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,160
And the same thing with the OG-san?

586
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,160
The same thing with the OG-san?

587
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,160
If you don't know, OG-san means like uncle, I guess?

588
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,160
Or maybe like old man?

589
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
I'm not really into that either.

590
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
So also, yeah, old dudes.

591
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
So you can also...

592
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,160
Go to AC for that too.

593
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,160
Because that's her shtick, you know?

594
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Fat older uncle.

595
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
Yeah, that's not for me.

596
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
Oh, what's the last one?

597
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Alright, the last one is...

598
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
Extreme body play stuff, yeah.

599
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,160
Don't fill my tits up with saline solution

600
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,160
and then jump on them to make them pop, okay?

601
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
Okay.

602
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,160
And then I won't fill your balls up with saline solution

603
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
and then jump on them to make them pop.

604
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
It's a mutual agreement there, okay?

605
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,160
Okay.

606
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
You need to rest?

607
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,160
It's okay, it's okay.

608
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
I'm usually not really sick.

609
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,160
I don't know...

610
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,160
I don't know who I am today.

611
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,160
But I'm okay.

612
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
It's really just my throat.

613
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,160
And like my coughing's been acting up.

614
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,160
Oh no, chat fucking broke on me!

615
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Shit!

616
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,160
Oh no, how am I supposed to look at chat?

617
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160
How am I supposed to read chat?

618
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,160
Okay, let me open my own stream.

619
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,160
Because my chat froze!

620
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,160
Are you kidding me?

621
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,160
Alright.

622
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,160
I will read chat from a tiny window from YouTube.

623
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
Okay?

624
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
Okay.

625
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,160
What's next?

626
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Let me adjust it because now I have to change my windows around

627
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,160
because my freaking chat froze.

628
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,160
Alright.

629
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,160
I will not pop your balls for you.

630
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,160
No, I'm sorry.

631
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,160
Maybe she will.

632
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,160
If you're into that, I don't know.

633
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,160
Here, let me even just close chat.

634
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,160
Or maybe if I close and then open it again.

635
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
It works!

636
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Oh, okay, okay.

637
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,160
I don't have to have the whole YouTube tab open.

638
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,160
Alright.

639
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
Pop them like boba?

640
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,160
Chew on them like boba balls?

641
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
Yeah, next.

642
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Alright, music stuff.

643
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,160
I didn't mention my music taste in my debut, so I can mention it now.

644
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,160
So, I wrote this when I was like...

645
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,160
It was like 2am last night when I made this slide, so...

646
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,160
I don't know why I said I don't have favorite genres.

647
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,160
I do have favorite genres.

648
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,160
I like Korean pop and Japanese pop and like...

649
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,160
Vocaloids.

650
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
I like vocal aids, too.

651
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
Yeah.

652
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,160
I'm not into making music or anything.

653
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:29,160
I don't have a goal of producing an original song or anything.

654
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,160
I mean, if it comes to that...

655
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,160
Sure, I don't know if I can do it, but it's not a goal of mine.

656
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,160
I'm not really passionate about making music or any of that.

657
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:46,160
But yeah, I put my current favorite songs here so you can listen to them if you want.

658
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,160
I'm kind of a normie and I apologize if you don't like it.

659
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,160
It's not like I'm going to be bothering you with my song choices.

660
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,160
You gifted some fun stuff on Throne. I can't wait to hear it be used.

661
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,160
Dirty.

662
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,160
Shame him.

663
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,160
Oh my god.

664
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
What a pervert.

665
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,160
Not on this Christian website, youtube.com.

666
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,160
Mods.

667
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
Hang him by his balls and twist him around.

668
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Yeah, I like Takayan. I like Metsuki. I like Romani Martinez.

669
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,160
I recently found out about What's-A-Heart.

670
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,160
I don't know how popular they are.

671
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,160
Yeah, and fuck, now I have to actually show it.

672
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
And then there's the last one.

673
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,160
Don't even worry about that.

674
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Or I like some dislikes.

675
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,160
I didn't mention this in my debut either, so let's talk about it here.

676
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,160
I like rats, obviously.

677
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
I like rats.

678
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
Yeah.

679
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
I like pink and cute things.

680
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
My whole room is pink.

681
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,160
And my whole room is covered in cute things.

682
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,160
Yeah, I like cute stuffed animals.

683
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,160
I like cute clothes, like Hawaii fashion.

684
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,160
I think I season to that too, like Hawaii fashion.

685
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,160
She sent pictures of her outfits and I was like,

686
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
She's like my twin, she's so cute.

687
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,160
I'm sorry if there's any Koreans in chat.

688
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
I don't think I'm pronouncing it right.

689
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,160
But it's basically just...

690
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
It's like race cakes.

691
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,160
And I like it with...

692
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,160
I like it with like cheesy sauce and stuff and like spicy...

693
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
I like it when it's spicy.

694
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,160
I don't know the brand I've been eating.

695
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,160
Let me try to look up the brand because I've been eating this one brand.

696
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,160
I've been eating this one brand like over and over again.

697
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,160
It's like the only...

698
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,160
Oh, fuck wrong tab.

699
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
It's like the only thing I've been eating lately.

700
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
I think it was spicy chicken.

701
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
Wait, what brand is that?

702
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
Bulldog, bulldog.

703
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,160
That one, the pink one.

704
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,160
It's really good.

705
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,160
That's right.

706
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,160
Korean perfect pronunciation?

707
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,160
I feel like that's a lie.

708
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Do you want to pick on each hand scabs?

709
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
Yes?

710
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,160
Scab picking stream?

711
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
No, I don't think that's allowed.

712
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,160
Yeah, bulldog.

713
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,160
I like those.

714
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,160
I think a...

715
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,160
Mukbang stream would be fun.

716
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,160
It's going to have a lot of...

717
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,160
Maybe it could be an ASMR stream.

718
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
It's going to have a lot of wet noises.

719
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,160
Eating on each hand scabs.

720
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,160
I don't...

721
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
Okay, I don't like to eat this.

722
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
Let it be known here.

723
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,160
I don't like to eat the scab skin.

724
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,160
I only like to eat the lip skin, okay?

725
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,160
I feel like scab skin is kind of gross.

726
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
I only like the lip skin, okay?

727
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,160
Okay.

728
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,160
Not auto cannibalism.

729
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,160
Well, I guess a little bit of auto cannibalism,

730
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
but also other people cannibalism.

731
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
Regular cannibalism.

732
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,160
Dislikes, dislikes, right?

733
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,160
I don't like to interact with real humans.

734
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
When I had like a real person job,

735
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,160
and not an anime girl on the internet job,

736
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
it was so awful.

737
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,160
People are so mean.

738
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,160
I don't like to talk to them.

739
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,160
So now I just spend a lot of time not doing that.

740
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
Okay.

741
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,160
She is into that shit.

742
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,160
Well, you know what?

743
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
If people are into scab eating,

744
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,160
I'm not gonna king shame them,

745
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
but I'm just not into it.

746
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,160
Do you like to pop zits?

747
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,160
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

748
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,160
Let me sit on your back and pop all your back knee.

749
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,160
That's quality time for me.

750
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,160
Okay.

751
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,160
I don't like people who can sing good

752
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,160
because I'm jealous of them.

753
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
I don't like heat.

754
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,160
I don't like being hot or moisture.

755
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
I do like to watch Dr. Pimple Popper.

756
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
Yes.

757
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,160
I don't like bugs trying to crawl in my ear.

758
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,160
And I have this really specific fear

759
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,160
of bugs crawling in my ear because one time

760
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,160
when I was sleeping, I was really young.

761
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,160
And why is my model?

762
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,160
I was really young and I was just sleeping.

763
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,160
And all of a sudden I felt like

764
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
something go inside my ear.

765
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,160
Like I felt a buzzing near my ear

766
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,160
and then I literally felt penetration in my ear.

767
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,160
Like something like crawled into my ear

768
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,160
and I woke up as fast as I could

769
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,160
and I like, you know, put my fingers up to my ear

770
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,160
to see like what the fuck is going on in there.

771
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,160
And I couldn't get anything.

772
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,160
Like there was, it felt like nothing was there.

773
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,160
So I don't, I don't know if I just have

774
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,160
like a dead bug in my ear since, since I was a child.

775
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
But now I'm just really, really scared of bugs

776
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,160
crawling into my ear because I don't know if,

777
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
I don't know if that was a dream.

778
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
I don't know if it's real,

779
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,160
but it felt really real and I hated it.

780
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
So yeah.

781
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,160
Next is people who are smart

782
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,160
because I'm jealous because I'm stupid.

783
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
Sleep with earplugs.

784
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,160
That's smart, but also I feel like

785
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,160
the earplugs are going to get dirty really quickly

786
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,160
and I'm too lazy to clean those.

787
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,160
Me being piloted by a bug like Ratatouille.

788
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
That fly that flew into my ear

789
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,160
has just been controlling my brain.

790
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,160
Okay.

791
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,160
And then finally,

792
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,160
other streamers you watch because I'm jealous.

793
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,160
Don't bring them up in my chat because I will cry.

794
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,160
Hold on, what's the next?

795
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,160
I'm kind of worried about what the next.

796
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
Oh shit, okay.

797
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,160
The next one is also, the next slide

798
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,160
is also common knowledge,

799
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,160
but I'm going to say it again

800
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,160
because I know a lot of people, you know,

801
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,160
we just met each other.

802
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,160
A lot of people, you know, don't know me.

803
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,160
So I'm going to give you an important note here.

804
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
Right?

805
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,160
Okay, here we go.

806
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,160
So,

807
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,160
I want to bring up right now to warn people

808
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,160
who want me to stay in the little sister character

809
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,160
at all times.

810
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,160
I can't.

811
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,160
Uh oh.

812
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,160
And he thinks her voice,

813
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,160
she's a fucking broadcastle that bitch.

814
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,160
She's a little liar.

815
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
Okay, yeah.

816
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,160
So it's true.

817
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
I am the only one in viewer who fix her voice.

818
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,160
All the other girls do use their natural voice on stream.

819
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,160
Even if you think like, oh, she's trying so hard.

820
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,160
She's trying so hard to sound mommy

821
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
or she's trying to,

822
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,160
she's trying to so hard to sound lolly.

823
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160
They're not.

824
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,160
I've been in voice calls with these girls.

825
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,160
They all genuinely sound like that.

826
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,160
They all genuinely sound that sexy and hot

827
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,160
and cute and pretty naturally, right?

828
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
Except for me.

829
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,160
Except for me.

830
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,160
Okay, yeah.

831
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,160
So I don't know how others do lolly voice 24-7.

832
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,160
Maybe they're born with it.

833
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,160
Like I see.

834
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
Or,

835
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,160
yeah.

836
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,160
But your little sister's a fake bitch.

837
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,160
So when she's sick

838
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,160
or maybe during longer streams like Donathons,

839
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,160
big sister in me will come out to play and torment you.

840
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,160
So yeah.

841
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,160
Let me move it.

842
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,160
Okay, there we go.

843
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,160
And there's my little drawing.

844
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,160
I'm sorry if that disappoints anyone,

845
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,160
but I hope you can still like me anyways

846
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,160
and I hope you can put up with dummy sister in me.

847
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,160
You get a full package with me.

848
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,160
You get little sister and older sister.

849
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
Okay, that's it.

850
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,160
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

851
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,160
Okay, so I can go through.

852
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,160
Only, and it's only been 43 minutes.

853
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,160
So I can go through safer work marshmallow questions.

854
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,160
Or we can do chat questions.

855
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,160
So, oh, I got a burp.

856
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,160
Don't hold back.

857
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,160
Yeah, ask me your most,

858
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,160
your moist burning questions.

859
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,160
Don't worry about whether or not

860
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,160
management would want me to talk about it.

861
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,160
Just ask it to me.

862
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,160
Yeah, they're not here.

863
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,160
It's just us.

864
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,160
It's just me and you, poopy.

865
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,160
Or we can just talk about like your own interests.

866
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,160
I don't know.

867
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,160
We can get to know each other if you want.

868
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,160
So I think first what I'll do

869
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,160
is go back to the chatting screen.

870
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,160
And nine out of 10, thank you.

871
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,160
And I want to open marshmallow.

872
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,160
And any questions you have,

873
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,160
I will look through those first

874
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,160
and then I will go through chat questions.

875
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,160
Okay.

876
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,160
What color is your panties?

877
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,160
Okay, I'll answer that one

878
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,160
because it's mercy.

879
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,160
They're light blue.

880
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,160
Okay.

881
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,160
Let me open marshmallow.

882
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,160
I think I should be able to show it

883
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,160
if I'm careful.

884
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,160
If I'm careful.

885
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,160
Okay.

886
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,160
I'm going to refresh it.

887
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,160
Okay.

888
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,160
It's good to have you back, lad.

889
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,160
Good luck on your future clothes and stuff.

890
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,160
This is what you've been up to the whole time.

891
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,160
Yup.

892
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,160
Any book recommendations?

893
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,160
Can I show the...

894
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,160
Let me try to show the marshmallow question.

895
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,160
So that way...

896
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,160
Oh!

897
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,160
Oh!

898
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,160
Well, there's my OBS.

899
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,160
There's...

900
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,160
Docs myself.

901
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,160
I hope not. Okay.

902
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,160
Here's a marshmallow question.

903
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,160
Okay, I'll put it right on chat.

904
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,160
Any recommendations for books instead of dojins?

905
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,160
Right.

906
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,160
All of the books I've read will get me canceled

907
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,160
if I say them,

908
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,160
but I guess I'm probably going to get canceled anyways.

909
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,160
So...

910
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,160
The problem is...

911
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,160
She uses...

912
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,160
Guys, she uses OBS.

913
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,160
Fight your IP address right now.

914
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,160
Go to her house.

915
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,160
So, like, all of the books I've read

916
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,160
have been mostly, like,

917
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,160
female, like,

918
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,160
orientated...

919
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,160
Oriented?

920
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,160
So if I tell you, like,

921
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,160
you might not enjoy it because you're a dude.

922
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,160
But I will tell you my all-time favorite.

923
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,160
But let me look it up first

924
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,160
because I forgot the name.

925
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,160
It is really problematic.

926
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,160
But, you know,

927
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
we're here today, so whatever.

928
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,160
It's Take Me With You by Nina G. Jones.

929
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,160
That one...

930
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
Okay, I might be really bad.

931
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,160
I haven't read it in a long time,

932
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,160
but it was the first...

933
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,160
It was the one I read that I was like,

934
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,160
ah, that's good.

935
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,160
So, I don't know.

936
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,160
Okay, next question.

937
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,160
Have you seen One Piece or Dragon Ball?

938
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,160
I started Dragon Ball,

939
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,160
but I didn't really care about it.

940
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,160
So yeah.

941
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,160
Considering the pin

942
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,160
and button aesthetics on your designs,

943
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,160
are you a fan of Coraline?

944
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,160
Okay, we didn't design our characters at all.

945
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,160
I also didn't apply to be in me,

946
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,160
so I didn't design anything,

947
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,160
but I do like Coraline.

948
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,160
It's a really good movie.

949
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,160
I really, really like it.

950
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,160
I watched it a lot on repeat.

951
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,160
When I was a kid, it really scared me.

952
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,160
I'm sure it scared a lot of kids,

953
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,160
but yeah, I like Coraline.

954
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,160
I saw you played League,

955
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,160
and I started wondering what rank is.

956
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,160
What your rank is.

957
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,160
Okay, I had League on my...

958
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,160
I had League on my like,

959
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:45,160
Steam library during debut.

960
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,160
I don't play League.

961
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,160
I've played League like maybe a total of five times.

962
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,160
I don't even know if I have a rank.

963
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,160
That's how much I don't know anything about League.

964
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,160
I've only really learned how to play Yumi,

965
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,160
and I don't know any of the other characters,

966
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,160
and I don't know how to play any of the other characters.

967
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,160
Like, I'm not really a League player.

968
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,160
I don't...

969
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,160
I'm sorry to maybe disappoint you,

970
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,160
or also to make you happy,

971
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,160
because a lot of people don't like League.

972
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,160
I don't know.

973
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,160
But I thought it would be a funny game to like,

974
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,160
have chat teach me how to play,

975
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,160
but you know, if you guys don't like it,

976
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,160
we don't have to play.

977
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,160
It's not that deep, you know?

978
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,160
Oh no, Yumi.

979
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,160
Guys, like I said, I haven't played League at all.

980
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,160
Like, don't start freaking out.

981
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,160
Don't start freaking out. It's okay.

982
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,160
If you guys get a fans League account, will it be free?

983
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,160
I think Strani already mentioned that, but yeah.

984
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,160
Yeah.

985
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,160
I don't know how fans League works at all, by the way.

986
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,160
Um...

987
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,160
So if you have, like, fans League questions,

988
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,160
please direct them to Strani,

989
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,160
because I've never used fans League before,

990
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,160
so I don't know.

991
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,160
Will you groom us?

992
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,160
Yes.

993
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,160
Um...

994
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,160
Ooh.

995
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,160
Well, this isn't interesting.

996
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,160
I don't know how fans League works at all, by the way.

997
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,160
I don't know how fans League works at all, by the way.

998
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,160
Well, this is an interesting question.

999
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,160
I barely even read it before showing it to you.

1000
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,160
Do you feel like there are equal parts of you

1001
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,160
in Yumi as Liberty?

1002
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,160
Are there things you're excited to do as Yumi

1003
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,160
that you couldn't do before?

1004
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,160
I could do anything I wanted as Liberty before.

1005
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,160
I just chose not to, you know?

1006
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,160
Um...

1007
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,160
Equal parts of you in Yumi...

1008
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,160
Equal parts of me.

1009
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,160
I don't know what that means.

1010
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,160
Um...

1011
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,160
I...

1012
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,160
How do we congregate together outside of streams?

1013
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,160
Right.

1014
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,160
There's a fan Discord,

1015
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,160
but I'm not in it, so we can't.

1016
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,160
Um...

1017
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,160
Once I announce that my PL is PL,

1018
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,160
you're free to go in my old Discord server.

1019
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,160
I'm also not in that one.

1020
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,160
So you cannot congregate with me outside of streams

1021
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,160
other than, like, pre-chat.

1022
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,160
But you can congregate with other fans outside of streams.

1023
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,160
There's a fan Discord out there on Twitter.

1024
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,160
I think you can search for

1025
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,160
Feeler Community Server or something.

1026
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,160
But we will not have our own...

1027
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,160
Is the chat behind Frozen?

1028
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,160
I don't know.

1029
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,160
We will not have our own, like, Discord server

1030
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,160
with us in it, you know?

1031
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,160
Yeah.

1032
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,160
Also, this question, I'm not quite sure

1033
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,160
what you mean by that,

1034
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,160
so I don't know if I can answer it.

1035
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,160
I do feel like the character's cute.

1036
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,160
I like her.

1037
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,160
Um, did I expect to get her?

1038
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,160
No, not at all.

1039
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,160
But yeah, I like her.

1040
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,160
I think she's cute.

1041
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,160
I'm cute.

1042
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,160
Do you feel like Yumi is just as big

1043
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,160
of a part of her as Liberty?

1044
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,160
Yes, of course. Of course. Of course.

1045
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:15,160
Oh, have you picked up any recent shows?

1046
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:20,160
I am just about finished watching

1047
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,160
to your eternity.

1048
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,160
It was really, really good.

1049
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,160
It was so cute and sad.

1050
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,160
I literally cried, like, every five episodes.

1051
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,160
I still have to finish watching,

1052
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,160
like, maybe the last two episodes or something.

1053
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,160
Um, but, yeah.

1054
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,160
Yeah.

1055
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,160
It was really good.

1056
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,160
I really recommend that anime.

1057
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,160
It's so sad.

1058
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,160
It made me cry so much.

1059
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,160
Even thinking about it now, I'm crying.

1060
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,160
I'm literally tearing up thinking about it.

1061
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,160
Oh, my God.

1062
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,160
Fuck that anime.

1063
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,160
Okay, okay, okay.

1064
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,160
Okay, this is an interesting question.

1065
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,160
I'm literally wiping away my fucking tears

1066
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,160
because it made me cry.

1067
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,160
Thinking about the anime.

1068
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,160
Have you watched Steins' Gate?

1069
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,160
No.

1070
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,160
In your lore video,

1071
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,160
was that an alternate from Mandela catalog?

1072
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,160
Do you also like other analogue horror

1073
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,160
or horror in general?

1074
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,160
Wait, okay.

1075
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,160
We did not come up with our lore.

1076
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,160
We had no part.

1077
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,160
Oh, my God.

1078
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,160
My neighbors are yelling downstairs.

1079
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,160
I'm sorry.

1080
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,160
We had no part in any of the lore, right?

1081
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,160
So, no.

1082
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,160
I don't know anything about that.

1083
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,160
Apologies.

1084
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,160
I do horror stuff, though.

1085
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,160
Can we get a taste of your real voice?

1086
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,160
Oh, my God.

1087
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,160
You can go look that up yourself.

1088
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,160
That's so easy to find.

1089
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,160
That's really easy to find.

1090
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,160
You can find my vods very, very easily.

1091
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,160
I'm trying to go back to the old questions.

1092
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,160
Oh, I think this is an important question.

1093
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,160
Our future schedule is going to be around the same hour,

1094
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,160
or are you planning to shift to earlier or later?

1095
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,160
For now, I think I will keep it at this time.

1096
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,160
I have to cough.

1097
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,160
Okay.

1098
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,160
For now it will stay here.

1099
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,160
I really want to do gorilla streams earlier in the day.

1100
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,160
I think that would be fun.

1101
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,160
But regularly...

1102
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,160
Earlier in the day.

1103
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,160
Hours before this one.

1104
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,160
For the future.

1105
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,160
For the future.

1106
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,160
For the future.

1107
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,220
Like, hours before this one

1108
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:03,980
For any European viewers

1109
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:09,820
For now, regularly scheduled streams will be at this time

1164
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,840
You can tell there's a really big difference between the names.

1165
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,840
Do you read any visual novels?

1166
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,840
Hmmmmm...

1167
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,840
Is... oh, there's one I'm thinking of right now.

1168
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,840
I forgot the name.

1169
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,840
I read a little bit. I read a little bit, but...

1170
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:57,840
I mostly read, like, manga where I started the anime, and then they stopped, like,

1171
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:01,840
you know, they took a break from making it for, you know, like, the next season and stuff.

1172
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,840
Like, I've read most of the New Freerun chapters.

1173
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,840
Like, I read manga more than I read visual novels, I feel like.

1174
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,840
So, yeah.

1175
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,840
Yeah.

1176
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,840
Oh, oh, I'm gonna disappoint you guys with this question.

1177
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,840
Have you watched Toradora Feelings on Romance Anime?

1178
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,840
I have not watched Toradora. I know. Disappointment. Oh my god.

1179
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,840
Esteban is a weird name for a female rat.

1180
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,840
I got it from... I got it from The Office.

1181
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:33,840
Um, I have not watched Toradora and Feelings on Romance Anime.

1182
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,840
This is probably why I haven't watched Toradora.

1183
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,840
I don't like romance anime.

1184
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,840
Like, as much as I love, like, yeah, didn't stuff.

1185
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:48,840
As kinky as I am for liking love, I don't actually like romance anime.

1186
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:54,840
So, I tend to stay away from a lot of romance anime.

1187
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,840
Yeah.

1188
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,840
I have not watched Violet...

1189
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,840
I tried watching Violet Evergarden, but I got bored.

1190
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,840
I'm super, super picky when it comes to anime. I apologize.

1191
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,840
This question is so fucking funny.

1192
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,840
Every trade, sweet, cuckoo, date a cuckoo.

1193
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,840
Have you ever dated a cuckoo?

1194
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,840
I guess we know who the cuck is.

1195
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,840
Point and laugh at the cuck.

1196
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1197
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,840
Actually, no, if you're a cuckoo, you should enjoy it.

1198
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,840
You should enjoy the humiliation.

1199
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:38,840
Right, um...

1200
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:43,840
I'm sorry?

1201
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,840
No.

1202
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,840
Um...

1203
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,840
No.

1204
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,840
But...

1205
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,840
Thoughts on the Polly thing?

1206
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,840
I've said before, I want two boyfriends.

1207
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,840
I want to dress them up like Barbie dolls, like twin Barbie dolls,

1208
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,840
and I want to make them kiss.

1209
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,840
And I want to watch them...

1210
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,840
I want to watch them kissing.

1211
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:07,840
That's my ultimate cuck... cuck fantasy.

1212
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,840
That's my ultimate cuck... cuck fantasy.

1213
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,840
That's my ultimate cuck... cuck fantasy.

1214
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,840
There's so many questions.

1215
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,840
Okay, okay, okay.

1216
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,840
I feel like I've already answered that one.

1217
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,840
How do you want your fan groups to interact?

1218
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:48,840
Interact.

1219
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:49,840
Talk to each other.

1220
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,840
I don't know.

1221
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,840
But I understand if they don't want to,

1222
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,840
because I know the content is different.

1223
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:58,840
I'm not going to be disappointed if everyone from the past is like,

1224
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,840
fuck this, I'm not coming.

1225
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,840
I understand, I understand.

1226
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,840
If you don't want to be here, because the content is different,

1227
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,840
I understand and that's okay.

1228
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,840
So it's really...

1229
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,840
I like you guys to get along,

1230
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,840
but also if you don't, that's okay.

1231
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,840
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

1232
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,840
Oh my god.

1233
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,840
How many rats total have you raised in your life?

1234
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,840
God, these questions are so boring.

1235
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,840
I'm so sorry to anyone who thought I would be entertaining today.

1236
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,840
Not because your questions are boring,

1237
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,840
but like my answers are boring.

1238
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,840
Okay, okay.

1239
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,840
I raised... raised.

1240
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,840
I don't think I raised, but I've had...

1241
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,840
Six.

1242
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,840
Six?

1243
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:39,840
Seven.

1244
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,840
Six or seven.

1245
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,840
Hold on.

1246
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,840
Let me count them.

1247
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,840
So my first two were...

1248
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,840
My first two were Pikachu and Mudkip.

1249
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,840
And then after that...

1250
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,840
After that, I also...

1251
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,840
After Pikachu died,

1252
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,840
you're going to hear a lot about rat deaths.

1253
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:01,840
They die really fast.

1254
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,840
So after Pikachu died, I got three more.

1255
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,840
I got crackers, I got Esteban, and I got Dennis.

1256
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,840
My neighbors are having sex downstairs,

1257
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,840
and I can hear it very clearly right now.

1258
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,840
I can hear them moaning and also the bed creaking,

1259
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,840
and it's making me a little bit uncomfortable.

1260
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,840
Is the marble my neighbors have sex downstairs?

1261
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,840
Um, yeah, right.

1262
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,840
Pikachu?

1263
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,840
Pikachu and Mudkip.

1264
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,840
Crackers.

1265
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,840
Dennis.

1266
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:39,840
Esteban.

1267
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,840
Pixie Luna.

1268
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,840
That makes seven.

1269
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,840
Yeah, that makes seven.

1270
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,840
Clap for him.

1271
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,840
Cheer them on.

1272
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,840
I do have thin floors and thin walls.

1273
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,840
Yeah, that's why I want to move.

1274
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,840
Tribute raiding stream?

1275
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,840
What?

1276
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,840
Tribute raiding stream?

1277
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,840
What?

1278
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,840
Never, bros.

1279
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:05,840
No.

1280
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,840
Is it illegal or otherwise not liked to talk about

1281
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,840
or ask about previous online identities

1282
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,840
with you or the other viewer, bros?

1283
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:17,840
So me, I'm comfortable with it,

1284
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,840
but also don't bring it up too much,

1285
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,840
because we're here now today.

1286
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:21,840
Let's be in the present, you know?

1287
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,840
Let's be...

1288
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,840
I should probably show that question.

1289
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,840
Let's be in the present together, you know?

1290
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,840
But obviously, it's the other viewer girls' choices.

1291
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,840
I'm not going to talk about it,

1292
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,840
like for them,

1293
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:35,840
like in terms of them,

1294
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,840
like I'm not going to tell you,

1295
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,840
but if they want to talk about it,

1296
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,840
you know, is their choice.

1297
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,840
I'm just happy that viewer let us talk about it,

1298
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:50,840
because I miss the people that supported me from the start.

1299
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:51,840
I really appreciate them,

1300
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,840
but I also appreciate any new people

1301
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:57,840
that are also coming in and saying hi

1302
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,840
and giving me a chance.

1303
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,840
Okay, now I'm getting to the inappropriate ones.

1304
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,840
Let me scroll back up.

1305
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,840
Okay, are you sure I'm not showing those?

1306
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,840
Oh my god, they're being so fucking loud right now.

1307
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:20,840
Holy shit.

1308
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,840
Here, let me...

1309
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,840
I should probably...

1310
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,840
You talked about being self-conscious about your real voice.

1311
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,840
I went and checked,

1312
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,840
and it could still be a little sister.

1313
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:40,840
Lies.

1314
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:41,840
You're gassing me up.

1315
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,840
You're sucking my cock so hard right now.

1316
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,840
Okay, I guess I'll get into the actual spicy question.

1317
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,840
Not spicy, but like...

1318
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,840
Okay, where are they?

1319
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,840
Oh, what do you plan to do on Fancy?

1320
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,840
Okay, well, I do want to play like,

1321
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,840
you know, the dating sims.

1322
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,840
I think those would be fun.

1323
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,840
Yeah, look at my throne.

1324
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,840
Yeah, look at my throne if you want to know

1325
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,840
what I plan to do on Fancy.

1326
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:29,840
Mom, louder!

1327
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,840
Is there your dominance?

1328
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,840
You guys are so funny.

1329
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,840
I guess I should probably talk about this too.

1330
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,840
Okay, since you weren't able to choose your character,

1331
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:53,840
how do you feel about lolly characters and lolly culture in general?

1332
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,840
So, I have drawn...

1333
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,840
Like, I've been drawing...

1334
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,840
I guess I didn't really know at the time.

1335
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,840
When I first started drawing,

1336
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,840
I was like, only drawing lollies.

1337
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,840
And also furries.

1338
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,840
I was drawing lollies with furries.

1339
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,840
And I didn't really care.

1340
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:18,840
Like, I wasn't like,

1341
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,840
oh yeah, shit's hot.

1342
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,840
But I also wasn't like totally against it.

1343
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:29,840
There were times where I found some stuff to be a little questionable.

1344
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:33,840
But I know what I'm comfortable with personally.

1345
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,840
And I will...

1346
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,840
I wouldn't be here if in the present moment,

1347
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,840
you know, I wasn't comfortable with it.

1348
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,840
And I'm obviously not going to do anything,

1349
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,840
but I'm not comfortable with it.

1350
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,840
Um...

1351
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,840
Yeah, in terms of like...

1352
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,840
Like, I am not immersed in the culture.

1353
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:54,840
There's a culture.

1354
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:55,840
I'm very new to this.

1355
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,840
I'm very, very new to this.

1356
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,840
Like, other than drawing them,

1357
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,840
I don't...

1358
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:00,840
I haven't...

1359
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,840
I'm not in the culture.

1360
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:06,840
So, I hope you can accept me as...

1361
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,840
I don't fucking know part of the family.

1362
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,840
Brother?

1363
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,840
I don't know.

1364
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:16,840
Yeah, hopefully no one's disappointed that I'm like new to this or anything.

1365
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,840
I don't know.

1366
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,840
We're being real right now.

1367
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,840
Yeah, no one's asking any like crazy questions.

1368
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,840
I thought you were going to ask me like...

1369
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,840
I don't fucking know like...

1370
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,840
How far can you squirt or something?

1371
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,840
Okay, I can go to chat questions now, I guess,

1372
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,840
for anyone that doesn't have marshmallow,

1373
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,840
or doesn't want to use it.

1374
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,840
So...

1375
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:45,840
Okay.

1376
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,840
We'll educate you.

1377
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:47,840
Thank you, thank you.

1378
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,840
That's why I said like send me your recommendations for like,

1379
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:54,840
you know, literature, quality, you know,

1380
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,840
literature because I haven't read them.

1381
01:07:58,840 --> 01:07:59,840
So, how far?

1382
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:03,840
How far?

1383
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,840
Probably only like...

1384
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,840
Ah, I want to say like...

1385
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,840
Maybe like a little 40 centimeters?

1386
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:17,840
Not far.

1387
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,840
Not far.

1388
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,840
Oh shit, chat just fucking broke for me again.

1389
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,840
No, no, no, we're good.

1390
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,840
What are your thoughts on fashion?

1391
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:32,840
What do you mean fashion?

1392
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:36,840
Not 47, just 40, 40, 40, 40, 40.

1393
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,840
Don't get your hopes up now.

1394
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,840
Is that impressive?

1395
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:45,840
Can we talk about this?

1396
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:46,840
I'm very, very not...

1397
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,840
I'm very, very unfamiliar with like YouTube rules.

1398
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,840
If I get bonked on YouTube, I apologize.

1399
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,840
How do we use marshmallow?

1400
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:55,840
It's the link in the description,

1401
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,840
and you just type your thing and you send it,

1402
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,840
and you can use like a translator

1403
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,840
on like a Google Chrome extension translator

1404
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,840
because the website isn't in Japanese.

1405
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,840
Would you rather be inflated with liquid like water

1406
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:13,840
or juice or with gas like air?

1407
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:16,840
Inflation, okay.

1408
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,840
Okay, let me think about it critically here.

1409
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:26,840
If I had to choose, I feel like...

1410
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,840
Juice is a bad idea.

1411
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,840
I feel like juice is asking to get some kind of infection

1412
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:30,840
inside of my body.

1413
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,840
So, I'm going to say...

1414
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:44,840
I'm going to say whatever is the safest,

1415
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,840
so either water or air, yeah.

1416
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,840
Or if I could choose probably none of them.

1417
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,840
My chat is so laggy.

1418
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:56,840
I have a lot of trouble seeing it.

1419
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,840
Maybe I should reload it again.

1420
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:00,840
Chat.

1421
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,840
Oh, if you could have picked your character,

1422
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:08,840
what would you have done?

1423
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,840
Okay, here was my mindset going in.

1424
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:16,840
My mindset was...

1425
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,840
I don't suit any of the characters.

1426
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,840
I thought maybe I would suit stabs,

1427
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,840
but even now looking at Mercy, I was like,

1428
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,840
damn, Mercy is literally Mercy.

1429
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,840
Like, I don't...

1430
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:30,840
She's not me.

1431
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:37,840
So, I didn't really think I would suit any of them.

1432
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:42,840
So, I kind of went in hoping for an interview

1433
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,840
so I could get the experience.

1434
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:48,840
I was hoping for an interview

1435
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,840
so I could get the experience of an interview

1436
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,840
because I've had the experience of an interview

1437
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,840
before.

1438
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,840
And I thought it would be good practice.

1439
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,840
I don't know how to explain.

1440
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,840
It was kind of a stupid mindset.

1441
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,840
I was like, you know what?

1442
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,840
You know what?

1443
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:09,840
I might get an interview,

1444
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,840
so let me try to get the experience of that.

1445
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,840
And then will I actually get accepted?

1446
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,840
Probably not, but I'll do the interview.

1447
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,840
And then, you know, down the line,

1448
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,840
if I apply to Hollow Life,

1449
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,840
I'll be super pro because I'll know how to...

1450
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:26,840
I'll know how to talk to them

1451
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,840
because I've had two freakin' other VTuber interviews.

1452
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:34,840
Yeah.

1453
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,840
Does the rats really stay on during...

1454
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:39,840
Yes, it does.

1455
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:40,840
Yes, it does.

1456
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,840
Yeah, unless you can get used to them.

1457
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,840
Yeah, because during my first VTuber interview ever

1458
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,840
with unnamed company,

1459
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,840
it was really, really scary.

1460
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,840
And it was...

1461
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,840
I did not do a good job.

1462
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,840
So I understand why they didn't choose me.

1463
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,840
But he...

1464
01:11:58,840 --> 01:11:59,840
I didn't...

1465
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,840
It was really nerve-wracking.

1466
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,840
Little did I fucking know

1467
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,840
that the VLR didn't even give me an interview.

1468
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,840
They didn't give any of the girls an interview.

1469
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,840
So I didn't get any interview experience.

1470
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,840
Yeah.

1471
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,840
You're in Hollow Life already, Imi-chan.

1472
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:19,840
Thank you.

1473
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,840
Aww.

1474
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,840
Do you have some sort of routine

1475
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:31,840
to prepare for the lulley voice?

1476
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,840
No, I don't.

1477
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:33,840
I just do it.

1478
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,840
And that's probably why my throat

1479
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,840
is fucked up right now.

1480
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,840
But no, I don't.

1481
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,840
I just do it.

1482
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,840
It's probably smarter if I do.

1483
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:41,840
Yeah.

1484
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:42,840
I thought you liked footskin as well.

1485
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:43,840
I do, I do.

1486
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:45,840
Kind of a shame to admit

1487
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,840
that I also like to eat my footskin.

1488
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,840
But I feel like I wouldn't want to eat your footskin.

1489
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,840
I feel like I know where my feet have been,

1490
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,840
so I'm comfortable with eating my footskin

1491
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,840
because it's like,

1492
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:56,840
I wash my feet really well

1493
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,840
every time I take a shower.

1494
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,840
So like,

1495
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:00,840
I'm comfortable with eating

1496
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,840
and peeling my footskin.

1497
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:02,840
But with your footskin,

1498
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,840
I don't know where those dogs have been.

1499
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:06,840
So I don't think I want to eat that.

1500
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,840
You know?

1501
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,840
Is the rat plush the reason for the rat suit?

1502
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:14,840
No?

1503
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,840
I just thought the suit was funny.

1504
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,840
I just thought it was a funny suit.

1505
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:27,840
Lemon ginger tea is your friend?

1506
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:28,840
I did drink tea.

1507
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,840
It's not really helping.

1508
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:32,840
Can you describe your creative process

1509
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,840
for your videos and streams?

1510
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:36,840
Videos?

1511
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,840
The years upon years upon years

1512
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:40,840
of,

1513
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:42,840
content.

1514
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,840
I've,

1515
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:46,840
I've,

1516
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,840
what do I even call it?

1517
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:51,840
Consumed.

1518
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,840
That's where I get my inspiration from.

1519
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,840
Literally, I've copied like,

1520
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,840
I've copied like direct voice lines,

1521
01:13:58,840 --> 01:13:59,840
voice lines.

1522
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:00,840
I've copied direct lines

1523
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:01,840
from like other,

1524
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:03,840
corn.

1525
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,840
Yeah,

1526
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,840
so there, there,

1527
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:07,840
that's where I get it from.

1528
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:11,840
Strani said,

1529
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:12,840
you're cool, get in.

1530
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:13,840
Yeah, I,

1531
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,840
oh yeah,

1532
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,840
because I told someone

1533
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,840
to kill themselves in my YouTube chat.

1534
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,840
That was it.

1535
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:19,840
Um,

1536
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,840
I don't remember doing that to be honest.

1537
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:23,840
I have,

1538
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:24,840
I have done the pin of shame before,

1539
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,840
where if someone leaves a,

1540
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:27,840
a hate comment,

1541
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:28,840
I'll pin the comment and,

1542
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,840
and uh,

1543
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,840
maybe I'll say something mean,

1544
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:31,840
but I've,

1545
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,840
but it's mostly so other people bully them.

1546
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:35,840
So yeah.

1547
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:37,840
Have you watched, dude,

1548
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,840
that's wholesome before joining feel or,

1549
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:40,840
a little bit, yeah,

1550
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:41,840
yeah, a little bit.

1551
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,840
A little bit.

1552
01:14:58,840 --> 01:14:59,840
I'm sorry,

1553
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,840
I'm just looking for those concrete slappers.

1554
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,840
What do you enjoy most about engaging

1555
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:07,840
with your community?

1556
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,840
I don't know.

1557
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:14,840
I feel like,

1558
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:15,840
I don't know.

1559
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:16,840
It's just fun.

1560
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,840
It's just fun to,

1561
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:19,840
to, to do.

1562
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:20,840
Like,

1563
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:21,840
I don't really,

1564
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:22,840
this is so fucking depressing.

1565
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,840
Oh my God.

1566
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:25,840
So,

1567
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,840
um,

1568
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,840
I don't really have like real life friends unfortunately.

1569
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,840
I'm really,

1570
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,840
really bad at like,

1571
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,840
keeping up with people in real life.

1572
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,840
So all the friends I used to have,

1573
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,840
I,

1574
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:37,840
I'm such a terrible person.

1575
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,840
I can't keep up with them.

1576
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,840
So like,

1577
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,840
you guys are like the ones I hang out with.

1578
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,840
God, that's so depressing.

1579
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:45,840
I'm sorry.

1580
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,840
Do you like us?

1581
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,840
No.

1582
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,840
Say ah.

1583
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:51,840
I hate you.

1584
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,840
You're trash.

1585
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,840
I don't think that's based.

1586
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,840
I don't like when people say kill to other,

1587
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:01,840
kill yourself to other people,

1588
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:02,840
but I get it's not serious.

1589
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:03,840
Yeah, it's not serious.

1590
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,840
But also like,

1591
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:05,840
if you're gonna leave hate,

1592
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,840
you should probably expect to get,

1593
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,840
to get hate back,

1594
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:10,840
you know?

1595
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:11,840
Um,

1596
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:12,840
so,

1597
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,840
I wasn't really thinking when I,

1598
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:15,840
when I did that,

1599
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,840
but it's,

1600
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:17,840
it's like, you know,

1601
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,840
if you're gonna dish it out,

1602
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,840
get ready for it to come right back to you.

1603
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,840
Sonic Generations or any Sonic game.

1604
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,840
Yeah, I'm not a gamer.

1605
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,840
I've played like,

1606
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,840
do you guys know Friv,

1607
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,840
Friv.com?

1608
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,840
It's like a really, really old browser,

1609
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:39,840
does it still exist?

1610
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:40,840
Let me look it up.

1611
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:41,840
It's like, okay,

1612
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:42,840
maybe it's not that old,

1613
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:43,840
but it's old to me.

1614
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,840
It's like a browser game website.

1615
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,840
And that's the only place I've played.

1616
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:53,840
It still exists,

1617
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:54,840
but it looks shitty now.

1618
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,840
That's not how it used to look like.

1619
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:57,840
Yeah, it's just a website

1620
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:58,840
where you play browser games.

1621
01:16:58,840 --> 01:16:59,840
And that's the only place

1622
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,840
I've played any sort of Sonic game.

1623
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,840
And I don't know if that's,

1624
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,840
that was like real Sonic or anything.

1625
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:05,840
Hag!

1626
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:07,840
Not a hag!

1627
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,840
Please!

1628
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,840
Is people getting overly parasocial

1629
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,840
concern you at all?

1630
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:25,840
Well, as long as

1631
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,840
you don't fucking find my house,

1632
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:28,840
no.

1633
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:33,840
How automatic is the automatic plushie?

1634
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:35,840
I haven't tested it out yet.

1635
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:36,840
I don't know.

1636
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:37,840
I haven't ordered it yet.

1637
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:38,840
Fortunately,

1638
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,840
thrown takes a little while,

1639
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,840
takes a couple days for them to

1640
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,840
because how it works with thrown is

1641
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,840
they don't always order it for you.

1642
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,840
Sometimes they just give you the money

1643
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,840
and then you have to order it yourself

1644
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,840
and then it takes a few days

1645
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,840
for them to actually give you the money.

1646
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,840
Yeah, I was hoping you'd get a test run.

1647
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:11,840
Even if I did get a test run,

1648
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,840
I wouldn't talk about it here.

1649
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,840
I went to fish after flash games were taken.

1650
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:23,840
Fish? What's fish?

1651
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,840
Is that another?

1652
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:26,840
What do you mean?

1653
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:27,840
Like did you go to touch grass

1654
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,840
after flash games were taken out?

1655
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,840
Is the plushie the same one

1656
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:33,840
that she tweeted about?

1657
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,840
Yes.

1658
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,840
Listen, I mostly put it there as a meme.

1659
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:42,840
It was mostly a meme.

1660
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:43,840
I really did not expect.

1661
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,840
I really did not expect anyone to get it

1662
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,840
because we're VTubers.

1663
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,840
I don't want to disappoint anyone,

1664
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,840
but if you want to see a real life

1665
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,840
gucci getting gutted,

1666
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,840
we're not the place for you,

1667
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,840
but someone got it anyway.

1668
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,840
Thank you.

1669
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,840
If you don't know what I'm talking about,

1670
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:11,840
I should probably...

1671
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:20,840
There is a plush polar bear context,

1672
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,840
so they don't know what I'm talking about.

1673
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,840
Polar bear context.

1674
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,840
There is a plush polar bear

1675
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,840
that has an extension.

1676
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:37,840
It has an extension.

1677
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:42,840
It has some other capabilities.

1678
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:43,840
I added it to my throne

1679
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,840
and someone very graciously purchased it.

1680
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,840
I guess I will be doing something with it.

1681
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,840
I know what you're talking about,

1682
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:57,840
so when I followed her,

1683
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,840
I replied to that clip I saw it too.

1684
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,840
Okay, good, good, good, good.

1685
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1686
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,840
The clam slam and plushy.

1687
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:14,840
You guys should get together

1688
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:15,840
and do a burping contest.

1689
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,840
Honestly, I really, really want to do

1690
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:19,840
an off collab one day.

1691
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,840
I think it would be really funny.

1692
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,840
So, sure, maybe we can do a burping contest.

1693
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,840
Honestly, I think I'll win.

1694
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:28,840
Just because...

1695
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,840
Can the other girls burp on command?

1696
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:31,840
I'm not sure.

1697
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,840
If they can, maybe I won't win.

1698
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:34,840
But if they can't,

1699
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,840
then I'm the fucking winner.

1700
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:37,840
There's no competition

1701
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,840
because I can burp on command.

1702
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,840
I love hearing women have fun.

1703
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,840
How do you balance v-tubing

1704
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:53,840
with other aspects of your life,

1705
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,840
such as work or school?

1706
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,840
I'm a loser.

1707
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,840
I don't have a job.

1708
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:04,840
Before this,

1709
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:05,840
this was...

1710
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:06,840
Before Vealer,

1711
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,840
this was also my job.

1712
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:11,840
So, yeah.

1713
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,840
School, it was really, really difficult

1714
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,840
for sure I stayed up during...

1715
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,840
I have a really bad schedule.

1716
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,840
I'm hoping that maybe management

1717
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,840
can help me a little bit more

1718
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,840
when it comes to schedule stuff.

1719
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,840
Because...

1720
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:31,840
When I was managing myself,

1721
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,840
it was really, really bad.

1722
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,840
I would record and then edit

1723
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,840
and then post all in one day.

1724
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:39,840
And...

1725
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,840
I'm a really big...

1726
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:45,840
Well, I used to be a really, really big perfectionist.

1727
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,840
I'm trying...

1728
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,840
Trying to let loose a little bit

1729
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,840
and let the editors take care of it.

1730
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:56,840
Let the script writers take care of it.

1731
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,840
I'm trying not to be so much of a control freak.

1732
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,840
But before, I was a huge perfectionist.

1733
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,840
So, it would take me forever

1734
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,840
to write scripts.

1735
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:07,840
It would take me forever to...

1736
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,840
to record.

1737
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:13,840
It would take me forever to edit.

1738
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,840
So, I would stay up a lot at night

1739
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,840
until, like, 1, 2, 3...

1740
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,840
Never 4 a.m.

1741
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:22,840
Maybe 4 a.m.

1742
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,840
I don't know. I would just stay up a lot. That's all.

1743
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,840
Do you properly take care of yourself?

1744
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:28,840
No.

1745
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:31,840
You can take care of me.

1746
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,840
Found you through the other Twitter account?

1747
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:35,840
Ah!

1748
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,840
That's good.

1749
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,840
I'm glad you enjoyed that.

1750
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:43,840
Mom... Mom might give you a run for your money.

1751
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,840
Will she?

1752
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,840
We'll see. We'll see.

1753
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,840
Starting in Shibibirp a bit.

1754
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,840
They do. They do.

1755
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,840
Can you burp the ABC?

1756
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:57,840
No. No.

1757
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:58,840
I think I'm gonna...

1758
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,840
I'm gonna vomit. I can't.

1759
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,840
Any hopes, wants, or ideas for a future outfit?

1760
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,840
A future second outfit at this stage?

1761
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,840
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh my god. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1762
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,840
Okay, okay, okay.

1763
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,840
I'm really excited to announce this.

1764
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:19,840
I already have a rigger in mind that I've sent to Strani.

1765
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,840
We will... I want...

1766
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,840
I think we're playing on reaching out to him soon.

1767
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,840
They're a really good rigger.

1768
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,840
Oh my god, I saw their work. They're so fricking good.

1769
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,840
So I...

1770
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,840
What I want to do is...

1771
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:38,840
I want to design a 2.0 model with you guys.

1772
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,840
I don't really...

1773
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,840
I don't really like...

1774
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,840
I don't really want to do a lot of art streams,

1775
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,840
mostly because I'm not good at art streams,

1776
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:53,840
but oh my god, Zellie's here! Hi!

1777
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,840
Hi, Zellie. Oh my god, I didn't expect you to be here.

1778
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,840
Oh my god, I'm flustered.

1779
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:00,840
Okay, yeah.

1780
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:01,840
So...

1781
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,840
What I want to do is I want to design a 2.0 with chat.

1782
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:12,840
Whenever we get a quote from the rigger,

1783
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,840
the modeler, I don't know,

1784
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,840
I will put it on thrown.

1785
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,840
So that way we can...

1786
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,840
You can donate to it,

1787
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,840
to a goal of having a 2.0 model.

1788
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,840
It's really expensive,

1789
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:30,840
but I'm going to do the art myself,

1790
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:35,840
so I'm hoping that we will be able to reach the goal

1791
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,840
and I can get another model soon,

1792
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,840
because I'll be doing the art myself,

1793
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,840
so maybe it won't be as expensive as a regular model,

1794
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,840
because if you don't know a lot of artists

1795
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,840
and a lot of riggers and a lot of, like, live 2D...

1796
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,840
Oh, mod Zellie! Oh, fuck you, right.

1797
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,840
Where is she?

1798
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,840
Zellie, where'd you go? You're lost in chat.

1799
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,840
Oh, there she is.

1800
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,840
Ah, shit.

1801
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,840
Ah, I can't do it in OBS with a frick.

1802
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,840
Okay, let me open...

1803
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,840
So, let me continue, explain.

1804
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:13,840
A lot of live 2D artists and stuff

1805
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:16,840
actually charge companies more,

1806
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,840
simply for being companies.

1807
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,840
They have, like, a corporal...

1808
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,840
Zellie, I have to find you again.

1809
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,840
Shit.

1810
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,840
Oh, there she is.

1811
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,840
Add as moderator.

1812
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,840
Standard?

1813
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,840
Standard, I don't know, standard.

1814
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:47,840
Okay, so they actually charge companies

1815
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,840
more than, like, a regular person,

1816
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:52,840
which is understandable, because, um...

1817
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,840
you know, companies are gonna probably make more money

1818
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,840
off of your work than, like, a, you know, an indie person,

1819
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,840
so, uh...

1820
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,840
I don't think Strawny mentioned

1821
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,840
how much the models costed.

1822
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,840
I don't even know if I should,

1823
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,840
but it was a lot.

1824
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,840
It was a lot of money.

1825
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,840
The models costed, like, more than you would expect.

1826
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:17,840
Let's just say that. They costed more than you would expect.

1827
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,840
So...

1828
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,840
Where was I going with this?

1829
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,840
Where the fuck was I going with this?

1830
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:28,840
So, yeah, if you want us to have 2.0 models, you know, um...

1831
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,840
you don't have to support us financially,

1832
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,840
but just watching us is really helpful,

1833
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,840
like, watching our streams or watching our videos

1834
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,840
that we put out, um...

1835
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,840
because once we get monetized, you know,

1836
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,840
ad revenue will help us.

1837
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,840
But yeah, models, 2K top?

1838
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:46,840
Not even close, bro.

1839
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:49,840
I was so surprised when I learned how much they cost.

1840
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,840
I was really, really surprised.

1841
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,840
I was like, oh, my God.

1842
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,840
It was a crazy amount, okay?

1843
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:58,840
For individually, it was a crazy amount.

1844
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,840
I'm not gonna...

1845
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,840
You could ask Strani, okay?

1846
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:06,840
But anyways, because I'll be drawing the model art myself,

1847
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:11,840
I think, I think, I think, I think a 2.0 should be like...

1848
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,840
I want to say 3K,

1849
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:17,840
because it's just gonna be paying for the raker.

1850
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,840
But we'll see.

1851
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:22,840
Anyways, one jazillion dollars.

1852
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:26,840
I really want to design a 2.0 with you.

1853
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:27,840
Yeah.

1854
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,840
And I want to make it emo.

1855
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,840
I want to make it emo.

1856
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,840
I think that would be really funny.

1857
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,840
You're doing your own work.

1858
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:39,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1859
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,840
Did you use a model on your stream before?

1860
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,840
Yes, of course. I was a V2 player before this.

1861
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,840
And I made my own model before.

1862
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,840
I can help design.

1863
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,840
Yes, I would love that.

1864
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,840
I made my own model.

1865
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,840
I can rig,

1866
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:59,840
but I don't really want to make my own 2.0 model

1867
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,840
because I'm actually kind of trash at rigging.

1868
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,840
I'm not good at it.

1869
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,840
So that's why I would like to get someone else to do that,

1870
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,840
but I can do the art.

1871
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,840
What kind of emo?

1872
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,840
Like basic emo?

1873
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,840
Internet emo?

1874
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,840
I don't know.

1875
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,840
Gothic maybe?

1876
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:25,840
Get free.

1877
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,840
I already have someone in mind.

1878
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,840
I already know who I want.

1879
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:36,840
I think you'll recognize the person's work.

1880
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,840
They're good. I've seen their stuff before.

1881
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,840
You should do 2000's emo.

1882
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:45,840
Gothic Lolita? I don't know.

1883
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,840
Something dark and mysterious.

1884
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,840
Is 2.0 still going to be emo?

1885
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,840
Of course.

1886
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:58,840
I can't completely change.

1887
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,840
I'm emo now.

1888
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,840
I can't completely change this design.

1889
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:04,840
That would be so mean.

1890
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:08,840
It'll still be emo, of course,

1891
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:10,840
but we'll have a different hairstyle.

1892
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,840
We'll have different...

1893
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,840
I got you, Bish.

1894
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:16,840
It'll be really cute.

1895
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,840
Unless you mean like I'm still going to use

1896
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:20,840
this model art?

1897
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:22,840
No, I'm not.

1898
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:25,840
I will be redrawing it entirely.

1899
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,840
I'm not going to just replace the hair and stuff.

1900
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,840
I would pay a go-rillion dollars for...

1901
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,840
for emo in me.

1902
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:34,840
You guys are so cute.

1903
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,840
Some of the biggest technical challenges

1904
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,840
you face during the transition?

1905
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:42,840
Technical challenges?

1906
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,840
Sorry, I don't know.

1907
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:46,840
I don't know.

1908
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,840
I don't know.

1909
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:50,840
I don't know.

1910
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,840
I don't know.

1911
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:54,840
I don't know.

1912
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,840
I don't know.

1913
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,840
Technical challenge?

1914
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:01,840
Sorry, I'm so bad at reading the full chat message.

1915
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,840
Someone asked what's the biggest technical challenge

1916
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,840
you face?

1917
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,840
None?

1918
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,840
I don't think there was.

1919
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:22,840
The only... I don't know what you mean by technical

1920
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,840
different software?

1921
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:26,840
No?

1922
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:28,840
I...

1923
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,840
I didn't get any new equipment

1924
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:32,840
from feel or I already had

1925
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,840
all of the equipment I needed.

1926
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,840
So,

1927
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,840
I didn't have to learn anything new.

1928
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,840
Some of the other girls, you know,

1929
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,840
aren't as experienced with ASMR.

1930
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,840
That doesn't mean they're bad at it though.

1931
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:48,840
They're probably better than me.

1932
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,840
You know?

1933
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,840
So, yeah.

1934
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:54,840
So, I didn't really have to

1935
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,840
do anything.

1936
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,840
The only really issue I have

1937
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,840
is trying not to be so much of a

1938
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,840
control freak when it comes to like,

1939
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,840
you know, my content

1940
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,840
because, you know, I have to give it off

1941
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:10,840
to someone else.

1942
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,840
And they will do the work

1943
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:14,840
for me and I will get it back

1944
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:16,840
and I can't

1945
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,840
find their house and knock on their door

1946
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,840
and tell them

1947
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:22,840
and give them a whole giant list

1948
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:24,840
of things to change because

1949
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,840
then that's just gonna make

1950
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,840
it take forever for every single audio

1951
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,840
and as much as I want

1952
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:32,840
to do that, that's really annoying.

1953
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:34,840
So, yeah.

1954
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,840
Thoughts on beavers?

1955
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:38,840
I've never seen one in real life actually.

1956
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,840
Scuff is usually part of every process.

1957
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,840
The only, I mean like,

1958
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:46,840
the only issue I have is my,

1959
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:48,840
my fucking iPhone.

1960
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,840
It keeps disconnecting.

1961
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,840
And sometimes it doesn't even work at all.

1962
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:56,840
That's the only issue.

1963
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,840
And also like,

1964
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,840
YouTube is stupid. Like, this YouTube

1965
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:02,840
chat is stupid.

1966
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:04,840
YouTube should fix that.

1967
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:06,840
Someone sent an email right now

1968
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,840
to YouTube CEO.

1969
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:10,840
Fix it. What is your response

1970
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:12,840
to the skibbity toilet allegations?

1971
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:14,840
It's fake! It's fake fucking news!

1972
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:16,840
Shibi made that shit up! It wasn't me!

1973
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,840
I swear to god.

1974
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:20,840
I swear to god.

1975
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,840
Let it be known here in front of the court of law.

1976
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,840
I didn't, I never said

1977
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:28,840
shibbity toilet.

1978
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,840
I never said shibbity toilet not even once.

1979
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,840
I don't know where you got that from.

1980
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,840
I never said shibbity toilet.

1981
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,840
It was mercy. There you fucking go!

1982
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,840
Admission of guilt.

1983
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,840
It was mercy.

1984
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,840
Mercy is the one that said it.

1985
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:46,840
And you put it on me,

1986
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,840
and now people are like,

1987
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:50,840
what a fucking zoomer.

1988
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:52,840
Shibbity toilet.

1989
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:54,840
Blame mercy.

1990
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:56,840
It was mercy.

1991
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,840
YouTube street have told

1992
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,840
that they are doing anything for streaming.

1993
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:04,840
They aren't doing anything for streaming anytime soon.

1994
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:06,840
Oh well, they can suck my dick. I don't know.

1995
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,840
YouTube is not optimized for streaming.

1996
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,840
Yeah. Which is understandable,

1997
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:12,840
but also like,

1998
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:14,840
lots of people stream on YouTube so optimize it.

1999
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,840
Yeah, it was mercy.

2000
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:24,840
We still got 30 minutes left.

2001
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:26,840
Objection, shibi never lies.

2002
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:28,840
Shibi does lie.

2003
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:32,840
Or was it our manager? No, it was mercy.

2004
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:38,840
YouTube is pursuing shorts?

2005
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:40,840
Are they?

2006
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,840
I don't know.

2007
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,840
I'm kind of...

2008
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:46,840
I'm biased against shorts when it comes to

2009
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:48,840
like YouTube shorts.

2010
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,840
Because when I posted shorts,

2011
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,840
not just on this channel, but on other channels,

2012
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:56,840
like the same content

2013
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,840
that would get popular

2014
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,840
on other platforms

2015
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,840
never really saw any reach

2016
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,840
when it comes to shorts.

2017
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:06,840
So I might even just ask management

2018
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:08,840
if like, if my shorts aren't getting views,

2019
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:10,840
I might even just be like,

2020
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:12,840
hey guys, can we like just

2021
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:14,840
post them on other platforms

2022
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:16,840
and not post them on YouTube?

2023
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:18,840
Because what's the point?

2024
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,840
You know, I feel like, I don't know,

2025
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,840
maybe they used to push shorts

2026
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:24,840
a lot in the past,

2027
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:26,840
but I feel like not anymore as much.

2028
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:30,840
But maybe that's just me. I've never really been

2029
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,840
I've never really been lucky

2030
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,840
when it comes to algorithm stuff.

2031
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:38,840
I've always been like, fighting.

2032
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,840
I've always been fighting to the nail

2033
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,840
when it comes to algorithm stuff.

2034
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:48,840
Yeah, it's wildly inconsistent.

2035
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:52,840
Yeah.

2036
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:00,840
7K, I know, but like,

2037
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,840
I don't know how else to...

2038
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,840
7K

2039
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,840
Do I sound prissy

2040
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:08,840
if I say 7K isn't that much?

2041
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,840
Like, I feel like

2042
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:12,840
I feel like other platforms

2043
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,840
that are more

2044
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:16,840
focused on shorts might have more

2045
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:18,840
talking like I'm a real fucking content creator,

2046
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:20,840
like I know what I'm fucking talking about.

2047
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:22,840
I don't know what I'm talking about, but I feel like

2048
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:24,840
they might have more potential.

2049
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:26,840
I just don't have faith in like, YouTube shorts.

2050
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:28,840
That's all.

2051
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:32,840
Uh uh uh uh.

2052
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,840
Many say they regret hyper-focusing on shorts.

2053
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:38,840
I don't know. I also hear that

2054
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:40,840
shorts um...

2055
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:42,840
I also hear that shorts like

2056
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,840
get you subscribers

2057
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,840
but they're always like dead subscribers.

2058
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:48,840
Is that true?

2059
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:50,840
Girl talk right now, okay? Let's um...

2060
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:54,840
What's it called?

2061
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:58,840
I keep fucking forgetting words.

2062
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,840
Okay, well I forgot the word.

2063
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,840
But like...

2064
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,840
Wait, what was I talking about?

2065
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,840
Oh yeah. Yeah, shorts get views

2066
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:12,840
but do they get you like subscribers? Cause I feel like

2067
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,840
the subscribers might be dead.

2068
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:16,840
Like I feel like, not saying they're bots

2069
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,840
but I feel like it's like

2070
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,840
the shorts viewers are just like zoomers

2071
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:22,840
that actually don't really stay around for your content.

2072
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,840
They're just there for shorts.

2073
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,840
Is this true?

2074
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:28,840
I do have...

2075
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:30,840
My grandma does have Alzheimer's.

2076
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:32,840
Alzheimer's doesn't run in my family.

2077
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:34,840
Yeah. Asked Strani?

2078
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:36,840
I don't know. I uh...

2079
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:38,840
I don't know. I don't know if Strani would know.

2080
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,840
I get more money off a 20k

2081
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,840
video than a 2 million view

2082
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:48,840
shorts. Yeah, that's true too.

2083
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:56,840
You get subs but they never go up.

2084
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,840
They never show up.

2085
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,840
Yeah, lots of kids do this girl.

2086
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04,840
We must find the meta. We'll find it together.

2087
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,840
I'm sorry to hear about your grandma.

2088
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:08,840
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

2089
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,840
I won't trauma dump to you about my grandma.

2090
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,840
But if I ever forget things

2091
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:14,840
or words, it happens like a lot.

2092
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,840
I forget words a lot.

2093
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:20,840
A dead sub is better than no sub though.

2094
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:24,840
Maybe for other people but for me

2095
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:26,840
I would not prefer dead subs.

2096
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,840
Some people shout on me for

2097
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:38,840
having a tiktok stream.

2098
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,840
They were like cringe tiktok

2099
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:42,840
as if you bitches aren't watching youtube shorts

2100
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:44,840
and like

2101
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:46,840
and like instagram reels

2102
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:48,840
and like I don't know any other kind of facebook

2103
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:52,840
like it's all the same stuff.

2104
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:54,840
It's all the same stuff

2105
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:56,840
and plus I'm not going to be going

2106
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:58,840
I'm not going to be logging on to tiktok.com

2107
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,840
and scrolling through my 4u page together

2108
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,840
I'm going to be curating it

2109
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:04,840
and showing you my absolute favorite

2110
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:06,840
short form content

2111
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:08,840
and you know

2112
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:10,840
if you don't like tiktok that's okay

2113
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:12,840
because it's basically just a meme review.

2114
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:14,840
Maximum little sister immersion

2115
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:16,840
you're going to

2116
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:18,840
sit with me and I'm going to make you

2117
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:20,840
watch me drool on my ipad

2118
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:22,840
as I scroll through my tiktok

2119
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:24,840
4u page

2120
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:26,840
and cough in your face

2121
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,840
How about a girl like you show

2122
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:40,840
you her funny little videos that makes you laugh

2123
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:42,840
I know but I think some people saw tiktok

2124
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,840
and they were like cringe tiktok

2125
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:48,840
maybe I should have said shorts

2126
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,840
or maybe I should have said memes

2127
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:52,840
I don't know but yeah

2128
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:54,840
I do scroll tiktok everyday

2129
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,840
thank you thank you

2130
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,840
but like I said it's all short

2131
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,840
all short form content websites

2132
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:02,840
just kind of have the same content

2133
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,840
because people repost their stuff there

2134
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:06,840
which yeah

2135
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,840
I see in disguise what you mean I see in disguise

2136
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:10,840
don't worry if the sub dies

2137
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:12,840
just bring him back with your spellbook

2138
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:14,840
oh I forgot to mention oh my god

2139
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:16,840
okay so

2140
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,840
shebe is into this too

2141
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:20,840
me and shebe both do witchcraft

2142
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:22,840
I'm sure shebe is more

2143
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:24,840
experienced with it

2144
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,840
well like me and shebe like both

2145
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:28,840
genuinely do it

2146
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:30,840
I think even mercy a little bit

2147
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,840
I think even mercy a little bit

2148
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:34,840
I think even mercy a little bit

2149
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,840
I think even mercy a little bit

2150
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:38,840
I think doing a witchcraft stream

2151
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:40,840
would be really fun the problem is

2152
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:42,840
some people may shit on me for my witchcraft

2153
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:44,840
because like I don't

2154
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:46,840
I don't go by any books

2155
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:48,840
because to me it's like

2156
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,840
I feel like to me it's like

2157
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:54,840
not that serious

2158
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:56,840
like I don't follow a lot

2159
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:58,840
of witchcraft rules

2160
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:00,840
because it's like

2161
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:04,840
I don't want to offend any witches

2162
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,840
and chat any witches or wizards

2163
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:08,840
and chat

2164
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:10,840
they're all gonna curse me

2165
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:12,840
they're all gonna hex me

2166
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:16,840
so yeah basically

2167
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:18,840
if I do some stupid shit

2168
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:20,840
during witchcraft streams it's because

2169
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:24,840
I'm not like a pro

2170
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:26,840
wizard

2171
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:28,840
I am not truly part of the shadow

2172
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,840
money wizard gang I am just

2173
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:32,840
a fraud I guess

2174
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:36,840
I would probably shit

2175
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:38,840
on something you do

2176
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,840
with love

2177
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,840
as long as it's with love

2178
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:44,840
shadow wizard here

2179
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:46,840
I'm very offended

2180
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,840
I'm sorry please please please please

2181
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,840
please don't curse me I'm sorry I'm sorry

2182
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:52,840
yeah terror stream

2183
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:54,840
that would be fun that would be fun

2184
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:00,840
oh my god okay hold on let me drink some water

2185
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:06,840
what strategies do you use

2186
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,840
to retain your original ASMR audience

2187
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:10,840
while attracting your new viewers

2188
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:12,840
as a youtuber?

2189
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:14,840
none? I am very well aware

2190
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:16,840
that ASMR people like

2191
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,840
there's like this weird thing

2192
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:20,840
Starry talked about it too

2193
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:22,840
there's this weird thing

2194
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:24,840
about like

2195
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:26,840
oh god this is so chronically online

2196
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:28,840
and boring and like weird

2197
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:30,840
and like stupid like go touch grass

2198
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:32,840
but I feel like

2199
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:34,840
and Starry agreed with me

2200
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:36,840
there's this weird thing where

2201
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:38,840
whenever an ASMRist

2202
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:40,840
starts to delve into

2203
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:42,840
v-tubing they get hate for it

2204
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:44,840
which is so weird

2205
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,840
because I feel like the

2206
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:48,840
I feel like the audience

2207
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:50,840
is very similar so you think it's like

2208
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:52,840
people would be happy

2209
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,840
but when I did it I got hate for it

2210
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:56,840
I got comments like

2211
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:58,840
another one

2212
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,840
another one

2213
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,840
oh my god

2214
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,840
okay

2215
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:20,840
like what do you mean another one

2216
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:22,840
like they're basically just streaming

2217
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:24,840
as an anime girl and you've been clicking

2218
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:26,840
on their thumbnails with anime girls

2219
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,840
in the thumbnail like why are you annoyed

2220
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:30,840
that they're now turning into an anime girl

2221
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:32,840
like you've been watching

2222
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:34,840
anime girl content

2223
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:36,840
I don't get it

2224
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:38,840
but

2225
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:40,840
um yeah so I have

2226
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:42,840
I don't have a strategy

2227
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:44,840
because I won't be surprised

2228
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:46,840
if I get no people from there

2229
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:48,840
because the content is so different

2230
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:50,840
like I will say like

2231
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:52,840
I'm still planning on doing ASMR content

2232
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:54,840
for sure for sure for sure for like we will have videos

2233
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:56,840
I'm planning a slime girl

2234
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:58,840
one for the first one I don't know if it will get removed

2235
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:00,840
by you too because

2236
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,840
slime girl is very wet but I want to do

2237
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:04,840
a slime girl for the first video

2238
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:06,840
um

2239
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,840
um

2240
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:10,840
yeah

2241
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:12,840
so many vtubers do ASMR

2242
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:14,840
yeah exactly like why is it so

2243
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:16,840
what what what what

2244
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:18,840
what

2245
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:24,840
I want to keep you your

2246
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:26,840
third D

2247
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:28,840
they want to keep your third D

2248
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:30,840
what does that mean

2249
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:34,840
find the ASMR streamers don't get any views

2250
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:36,840
when they stream non ASMR

2251
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:38,840
that's true but I like ASMR

2252
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:40,840
so I'm okay with streaming ASMR

2253
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,840
it is weird I'm guessing they're worried about

2254
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:44,840
that their ASMR is going to stop ASMR

2255
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:46,840
all together yeah I think

2256
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:48,840
they assume that but like

2257
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:50,840
that's often not

2258
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:52,840
the case

2259
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,840
I mean sometimes it is

2260
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:00,840
she is not my oh she

2261
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:02,840
she is to be rejected in shunt

2262
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,840
fuck this bitch

2263
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:12,840
okay I keep seeing this question

2264
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,840
a lot I don't know if it's the same person

2265
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:16,840
thank you for the verb reading

2266
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:18,840
um

2267
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,840
someone keeps saying

2268
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:22,840
why did what inspired you to be a vtuber

2269
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:26,840
um

2270
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:30,840
can I say this

2271
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,840
I used to be a fleshtuber

2272
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:34,840
I used to be a fleshtuber

2273
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:36,840
yeah I used to be a fleshtuber

2274
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:38,840
what inspired me to start streaming was

2275
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:40,840
I had this friend that I met

2276
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:42,840
and he he was like

2277
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:44,840
oh

2278
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:46,840
I'm a streamer and I was like dude

2279
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:48,840
that's so fucking gay and boring why would you ever stream

2280
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:50,840
it was a commissioner

2281
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:52,840
at the time so obviously like it was a dude

2282
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:54,840
that commissioned me and he was like

2283
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:56,840
I'm a streamer I'm commissioning you

2284
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:58,840
your art for my stream right

2285
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:00,840
and I was like

2286
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:02,840
that's cringe

2287
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:06,840
in my head I was like that's cringe

2288
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:08,840
but I was like

2289
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:10,840
sure yeah yeah yeah

2290
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:12,840
I'll do some art for you

2291
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:14,840
for your stream

2292
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:16,840
and then

2293
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:18,840
when I like tuned into the stream

2294
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:20,840
I was like

2295
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:22,840
maybe this is kinda cool

2296
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:24,840
maybe this is kinda cool

2297
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:26,840
actually I kind of ate my words

2298
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:28,840
I was like oh actually

2299
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:30,840
actually you know

2300
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:32,840
maybe maybe I can do this too

2301
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:34,840
so I

2302
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:36,840
did it

2303
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:38,840
and I had a lot of fun with it and I was like

2304
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:40,840
oh my god

2305
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,840
this is kind of fun and I remember

2306
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:44,840
my first stream

2307
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:46,840
what I did was I had a laptop at the time

2308
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:48,840
so I streamed on my laptop

2309
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:50,840
and then I used

2310
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:52,840
like my phone

2311
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:54,840
as like a facecam

2312
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:56,840
and then I didn't even have a microphone I used

2313
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:58,840
my laptop microphone

2314
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:00,840
and then I was having so much fun

2315
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:02,840
with like

2316
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:04,840
I think I had like one viewer maybe

2317
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:06,840
so um

2318
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:08,840
I was having so much fun

2319
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:10,840
but then like halfway through the stream

2320
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:12,840
my work called me

2321
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:14,840
and it made my phone

2322
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:16,840
like fall off of the stand

2323
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:18,840
so my facecam fell

2324
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:20,840
and I had to like answer the

2325
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,840
the work call during stream

2326
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:24,840
and I was like hello

2327
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:26,840
and they were like hey Emmy can you come in

2328
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:28,840
tomorrow at I don't know 3pm

2329
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:30,840
and I was like

2330
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:32,840
nope

2331
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:34,840
I never came in

2332
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,840
when they asked me to

2333
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:38,840
but um

2334
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,840
and then I like

2335
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:42,840
stream right after that cause like

2336
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:44,840
I didn't

2337
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:46,840
I didn't want this stream to like

2338
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:48,840
you know

2339
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:50,840
continue after work called me

2340
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:52,840
um

2341
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:54,840
I don't think I have that

2342
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:56,840
that stream

2343
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:58,840
like saved but it was really cringe

2344
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:00,840
and I had a lot of fun and then I continued

2345
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:04,840
hold on

2346
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:12,840
ok

2347
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:16,840
I continued until

2348
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:18,840
I

2349
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:20,840
sometimes I would just use a vtuber

2350
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,840
because I wanted to have big boobs

2351
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:24,840
and so I would find like a 3d model

2352
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:26,840
with really big boobs and I would

2353
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:28,840
like jiggle them around

2354
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:30,840
jiggle them around

2355
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:32,840
it was really fun to just use one

2356
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:34,840
to have big boobs

2357
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:36,840
um

2358
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:38,840
and then um

2359
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:42,840
I saw like

2360
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,840
prism project auditions

2361
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:46,840
and I didn't even know what hollow life was

2362
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:48,840
but I was like whoa

2363
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,840
there's like companies for this shit

2364
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:52,840
damn

2365
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:54,840
um

2366
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:56,840
Emmy voice on the serum

2367
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:58,840
it was

2368
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:00,840
it was funny ok it was funny

2369
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:04,840
one moment oh my god

2370
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:06,840
I'm sick ok I'm sick for any new people

2371
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:08,840
I'm sick right now

2372
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:12,840
right

2373
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,840
so anyways

2374
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:16,840
um

2375
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:18,840
I saw prism project auditions

2376
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:20,840
and I was like yo

2377
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:22,840
this was meant for me

2378
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:24,840
I've been using a vtuber model

2379
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:26,840
I know how to do this

2380
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:28,840
I'm totally getting it

2381
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:30,840
and yeah prism project is gone now

2382
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:32,840
um

2383
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:34,840
unfortunately you know what it's gone

2384
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:36,840
because I wasn't in there I would have saved that company

2385
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:38,840
I would have gotten them so much money

2386
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:40,840
they would still be here if I was in there

2387
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:42,840
I thought I was in there I'm kidding

2388
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,840
I'm kidding I'm kidding

2389
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:46,840
no I probably would have gone down with them

2390
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:48,840
if I had ever joined

2391
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:50,840
but um

2392
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:54,840
obviously I got rejected

2393
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:56,840
of course with that I'd be like are you fucking kidding me

2394
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:58,840
oh my god it would be so funny to show you guys my old prism project audition

2395
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:00,840
it was so funny

2396
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:02,840
it was so funny

2397
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:04,840
it was so fucking funny

2398
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:06,840
you will cringe

2399
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:08,840
so hard

2400
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:10,840
but um

2401
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:14,840
after that I was kind of

2402
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:16,840
really like

2403
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:18,840
mad because I was like what

2404
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:20,840
are you kidding me I got rejected

2405
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:22,840
so um

2406
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:24,840
I stopped streaming

2407
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:26,840
all together because I was busy

2408
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:28,840
but then afterwards um

2409
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:30,840
one of my other friends

2410
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:32,840
one of my other streamer friends

2411
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:34,840
because I hadn't made streamer friends during this time was like

2412
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:36,840
oh

2413
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:38,840
you should you can draw anime

2414
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:40,840
so maybe you should try drawing

2415
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:42,840
vtuber models because you can make

2416
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:44,840
money off of that

2417
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:46,840
and at first I was like

2418
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:48,840
that looks complicated right

2419
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:50,840
um

2420
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:54,840
at first I was like oh that looks complicated

2421
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,840
I don't know and then I tried it once

2422
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:58,840
and learned and I was like

2423
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:00,840
it's kind of easy

2424
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:02,840
it's not as hard as it looks

2425
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:04,840
um

2426
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:06,840
and so that's when I

2427
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:08,840
learned how to make vtuber models and I was like

2428
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:10,840
well I'm here now

2429
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:12,840
so let me make a model for myself too

2430
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:14,840
and uh

2431
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:16,840
now we're here

2432
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:18,840
that was a long ass story

2433
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:24,840
do show

2434
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:26,840
I don't let me see if I can even

2435
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:28,840
find it

2436
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:30,840
what's really crazy was

2437
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:32,840
um

2438
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:34,840
not crazy but cringe

2439
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:36,840
it might not be on this computer

2440
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:38,840
it might be on my old laptop

2441
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:40,840
I'll try to look for it on this computer

2442
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:42,840
but I'm not sure if it's here

2443
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:44,840
um

2444
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:46,840
during that time

2445
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:48,840
the only thing I knew about vtubers was like

2446
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:50,840
what I had seen from prison project

2447
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:52,840
and I was like oh they like cute girls

2448
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:54,840
they want to hear a cute voice

2449
01:50:56,840 --> 01:50:58,840
um

2450
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:02,840
what is this

2451
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:04,840
oh I just found my script for my audition

2452
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:06,840
aw

2453
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:08,840
bro

2454
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:10,840
so what I did was

2455
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:12,840
at first I was like okay let me try to be a cute girl

2456
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:14,840
right

2457
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:16,840
but I couldn't make the voice

2458
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:18,840
and that's why it's really cringe

2459
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,840
I couldn't do it I couldn't it was

2460
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:22,840
I was really bad at voice acting so instead I was like

2461
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:24,840
okay

2462
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:26,840
let me be a MILF

2463
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:28,840
let me voice act as a MILF

2464
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:30,840
because they had some

2465
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:32,840
some mommy type models so I was like

2466
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:34,840
let me let me try that

2467
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:36,840
so I roleplayed

2468
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:38,840
as a 40 year old

2469
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:40,840
I roleplayed

2470
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:42,840
as a 40 year old

2471
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:44,840
MILF

2472
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:48,840
in my prison project audition

2473
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:50,840
I literally said I'm 40 years old

2474
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:52,840
and I have two daughters

2475
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:56,840
and then I flirted

2476
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:58,840
with the listener

2477
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:00,840
during the whole

2478
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:02,840
because their thing was like introduce yourself

2479
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:04,840
in a character

2480
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:06,840
so I basically flirted with

2481
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:08,840
the listener as

2482
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:10,840
as my audition

2483
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:12,840
let me see what I found

2484
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:14,840
I found the script I don't know if I can find

2485
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:18,840
oh god the dog is parking

2486
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:20,840
downstairs type

2487
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:22,840
video

2488
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:24,840
videos

2489
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:26,840
I found the

2490
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:28,840
modified

2491
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:30,840
no

2492
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:36,840
well I can't find the video

2493
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,840
but I can read to you a bit of the script

2494
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:40,840
hold on

2495
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:42,840
I was like it's in dead a 40 year old

2496
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:44,840
MILF

2497
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:46,840
let me see

2498
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:56,840
I fed

2499
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,840
I roleplayed feeding the listener

2500
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:00,840
noodles

2501
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:02,840
I was like open wide

2502
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:04,840
see I told you

2503
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:08,840
you doubt me too much

2504
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:10,840
if you keep doing this I'll just have to

2505
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:12,840
give you some firsthand experience

2506
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:14,840
of what I can really do

2507
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:20,840
I read it in a mommy voice

2508
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:22,840
that'll have to be me showing you

2509
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:24,840
my big sister

2510
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:26,840
oh my god fuck I didn't even realize

2511
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:28,840
we're close to two hours

2512
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,840
I gotta keep my eye on the time

2513
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:34,840
cause we're gonna read a 0 after this too

2514
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:38,840
but yeah that was me

2515
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:40,840
that was me trying to be a MILF

2516
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:42,840
for a prison project

2517
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:44,840
what happens to your liberty channel now

2518
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:46,840
nothing

2519
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:48,840
it'll stay up but all my new content

2520
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:50,840
will be here

2521
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:52,840
that's it

2522
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:54,840
can we see the mascot

2523
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:56,840
I apologize

2524
01:53:56,840 --> 01:53:58,840
sure

2525
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:02,840
I think I should probably post

2526
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:06,840
the mascot on twitter right

2527
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:12,840
wait where is the mascot

2528
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:20,840
here it is

2529
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:22,840
oh that's humongous

2530
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:32,840
here it is here's the mascot

2531
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:34,840
you can see the old mascot

2532
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:36,840
in my background music video

2533
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:40,840
the bgm

2534
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:44,840
I just thought it was a little too menacing

2535
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:46,840
and all the other girls

2536
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:48,840
had like really cute mascots

2537
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:50,840
and I was like

2538
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:52,840
I want something cute so I drew something cute

2539
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:54,840
and this is it

2540
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:56,840
I mostly got inspiration from like

2541
01:54:56,840 --> 01:54:58,840
Pinterest photos

2542
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:00,840
but yeah here's the picture of the mascot

2543
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:02,840
if you wanna draw

2544
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:04,840
if you wanna draw yourself

2545
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:06,840
the little pin pals there you go

2546
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:08,840
here I'll put it in the corner maybe

2547
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:12,840
down here up here

2548
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:14,840
yeah so cute

2549
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:18,840
yes this is

2550
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:20,840
this is different from the schedule

2551
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:22,840
the schedule has the old mascot on it

2552
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:26,840
did Azura start streaming yet

2553
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:28,840
let me check

2554
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:30,840
I think I made it

2555
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:32,840
so that it automatically

2556
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:34,840
raids right

2557
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:40,840
so cute

2558
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:42,840
can I eat it you wanna eat yourself

2559
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:44,840
yourself

2560
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:50,840
ok now yeah I'll stay with you until Azura starts

2561
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:54,840
can you wink

2562
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:56,840
ah that was kinda cute

2563
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:58,840
oh my god I just cut it

2564
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:00,840
I kinda just like

2565
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:02,840
I blushed at myself

2566
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:06,840
there you go that's me winking

2567
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:08,840
I can wink now

2568
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:10,840
I couldn't wink before

2569
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:12,840
but now I can

2570
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:22,840
what inspired you to make the leap to 18 plus content

2571
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:26,840
so I actually

2572
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:28,840
was gonna make

2573
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:30,840
like ok

2574
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:34,840
I listened to it a lot before

2575
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:36,840
and I listened to it a lot before

2576
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:38,840
and since I was doing

2577
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:40,840
I was already doing you know

2578
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:42,840
the safer work stuff

2579
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:44,840
I actually planned on starting

2580
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:46,840
way way earlier than I

2581
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:48,840
then I ended up starting

2582
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:52,840
but I kind of

2583
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:54,840
just like I was

2584
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:56,840
it was always in the back of my head

2585
01:56:56,840 --> 01:56:58,840
I was like yeah I'm gonna do it soon eventually

2586
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:00,840
but I had put a goal in my head

2587
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:02,840
that I thought I would never reach

2588
01:57:02,840 --> 01:57:04,840
when it comes to subscribers

2589
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:06,840
I was like once I get 25,000 subscribers

2590
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:08,840
I will

2591
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:10,840
I will do

2592
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:12,840
you know 18 plus a somewhere

2593
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:14,840
and then I got 25,000 subscribers

2594
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:16,840
like way faster than I thought I would

2595
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:18,840
and I was like oh fuck I'm not ready

2596
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:20,840
I didn't think I would actually get that amount hold on

2597
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:22,840
wait wait wait I'm not ready

2598
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:24,840
so

2599
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:26,840
so you know I just made it

2600
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:28,840
when I was finally ready

2601
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:30,840
yeah basically I listened to it before

2602
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:32,840
and I was like maybe I should do it too

2603
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:36,840
um

2604
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:42,840
what a sweet and innocent looking peach

2605
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:46,840
um

2606
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:48,840
is this stream finishing before your neighbors?

2607
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:50,840
my neighbors have stopped now

2608
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:52,840
I don't hear it anymore

2609
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:54,840
yeah from consuming it

2610
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:56,840
to making it yupp

2611
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:58,840
yupp yupp yupp yupp

2612
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:00,840
um

2613
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:04,840
the concept for your eyes

2614
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:06,840
like the eggs?

2615
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:10,840
ask strawny

2616
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:12,840
I didn't design the character I don't know

2617
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:18,840
they're in the afterglow

2618
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:20,840
they're sleeping now

2619
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:22,840
shh don't wake them up

2620
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:26,840
okay though

2621
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:28,840
um

2622
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:30,840
that was a weak performance

2623
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:32,840
is it because you didn't hear it?

2624
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:34,840
I heard it

2625
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:36,840
honestly

2626
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:40,840
I don't want to trash talk my neighbors

2627
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:42,840
but I don't know how the guy downstairs gets it dude

2628
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:44,840
he's like

2629
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:46,840
oh my god I should probably talk about

2630
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:48,840
I don't know how the guy downstairs gets any pussy

2631
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:50,840
he's like

2632
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:52,840
kind of annoying

2633
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:54,840
and ugly

2634
01:58:56,840 --> 01:58:58,840
and he's kind of mean

2635
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:00,840
I don't know how he gets any

2636
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:04,840
and he's kind of stinky like I've seen inside his

2637
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:06,840
I've seen inside his apartment

2638
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:08,840
and I'm like bro

2639
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:10,840
bro clean up a little

2640
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:16,840
you didn't hear that from me though

2641
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:28,840
start moaning louder

2642
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:30,840
no

2643
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:32,840
they've already heard me moaning anyways

2644
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:36,840
buttons like a voodoo doll

2645
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:38,840
probably yeah

2646
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:40,840
yeah the eyes probably do represent

2647
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:42,840
that would make sense

2648
01:59:50,840 --> 01:59:52,840
sorry I know I'm being quiet

2649
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:54,840
my voice hurts after talking for so long

2650
01:59:56,840 --> 01:59:58,840
what's the thing

2651
01:59:58,840 --> 02:00:00,840
or item you would steal from the other girls

2652
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:02,840
they're tits

2653
02:00:02,840 --> 02:00:04,840
so I can touch them

2654
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:06,840
duh

2655
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:08,840
you think I want to be flat

2656
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:10,840
you think I chose this

2657
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:12,840
I want boobies

2658
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:14,840
I want big hunkers

2659
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:16,840
so

2660
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:18,840
I don't know

2661
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:20,840
I don't know

2662
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:22,840
I don't know

2663
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:24,840
I don't know

2664
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:26,840
so of course if I could steal

2665
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:28,840
something from the other girls

2666
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:30,840
I would steal their boobies

2667
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:42,840
flat is justice

2668
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:44,840
you ain't flat

2669
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:46,840
I'm not

2670
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:48,840
really you think so

2671
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:50,840
well breast envy is cute

2672
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:52,840

2675
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:00,840
maybe the 2.0 will have tits

2676
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:02,840
I'm kidding I'm kidding I can't

2677
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:04,840
I can't I can't do that

2678
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:06,840
image flat flat is ok therefore

2679
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:08,840
image is ok

2683
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:18,840

2684
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:20,840
there's this maybe someone can find it for me

2685
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:22,840
there's this meme

2686
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:24,840
of this anime girl

2687
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:26,840
and she has like really flat boobs

2688
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:28,840
but the meme was like oh

2689
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:30,840
you know flat boobs

2690
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:32,840
they're just they're just hiding

2691
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:34,840
like in another dimension or something

2692
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:36,840
and then you can see behind her

2693
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:38,840
you can see behind her

2694
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:40,840
and like there's like giant tits

2695
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:42,840

2729
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:22,840
