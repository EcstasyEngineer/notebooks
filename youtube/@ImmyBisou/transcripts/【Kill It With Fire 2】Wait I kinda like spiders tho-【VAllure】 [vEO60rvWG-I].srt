00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
music

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,000
music

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
music

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:07,680
My mic's been all whack this whole time and I'm confused.

5
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
TESTING!

6
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Whoa!

7
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm so sorry.

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
I mean, I heard you're loading.

10
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,680
That's good.

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,680
Yeah.

12
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,680
Let me see if OBS did.

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,680
TESTING!

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
Oh, man.

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
Wait, I think...

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680
I think you're all...

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,680
I mean, I think you're all...

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
I mean, I think you're all...

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,680
I mean, I think you're all...

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,680
I mean, I think you're all...

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
I mean, I think you're all...

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,800
I think you're not muted.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Like we are not muted.

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,680
Oh, my God!

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,680
Emily!

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
Emily, no way!

27
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:13,600
Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hi. Hi. Hi. Can you hear? How are volume

28
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:27,120
levels? Test. Mic test. Mic test. One, two, three. Should we all just yell? Yes. I'm so

29
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:35,280
sorry. Did we peak? I don't know. All right. Reflins are reporting. They're saying hi,

30
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,760
mom. Right? But, but yes, it's hi, mommy equal that the volume levels are good. Come on. Yes.

31
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:52,080
They want louder and all four are clear and loud. Yes. Right. Okay. Let's go. They say the, someone

32
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,040
says all sound is extremely loud, but if we're all equally extremely loud. Extremely loud. And it's

33
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:05,200
even. Yeah. Yeah. I'll put it down a wee bit. By a whole three or four decibels, I'll put it down.

34
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,640
You're welcome. Okay. Let me see. Let me bring up the girlies. Okay. I hope everything is good on

35
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:20,240
my end. Maybe hopefully. Apparently, I'm peaking really badly, but I don't know how to fix that.

36
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:27,520
So, I'll just wait. I'll wait for next stream. We'll fix it next. It sounds fun. I just kind of

37
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,760
lowered you a bit on discord. Yeah, it's not fine for my stream, but it's okay, whatever.

38
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:41,200
Oh, no. Do you have a limiter on your microphone? Um, I plug in. Um, yeah, filters.

39
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:52,000
I do. I do. I tried to turn it off. Turn it off. Yeah, I turn it off. But okay,

40
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,760
because for me, what happened back in the day when I was using limiters is it just made my voice

41
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:06,880
like peak hard. Oh, really? Yeah, it's really weird. I turned it off. I don't know. Did that help,

42
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:14,880
chat? Did it make it worse? Did it help? Did it make it worse? I don't know.

43
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,440
If we think we can progress, I must demand at gunpoint. Everyone introduce themselves.

44
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,560
Okay, right. That's my bike. Oh, I won't let the gun.

45
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,080
Oh, yeah, we have guns. Yeah, guns. Who's going first?

46
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:47,120
Right. Are we all pointing at me? Me? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go. Go.

52
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,480
I said, hello. I'm Stony Cull from viewers generation one indulge, and I'm Scottish,

53
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,480
and I'm sorry if you can't understand that accent.

54
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,800
A game called kill it with fire two. He has just completed the tutorial, which means that we can

55
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,720
do campaign word together. We have an assortment of tools to expel this ship as we got abducted

56
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:13,280
like moments ago. And basically, we need to no more spiders. No more, no more spiders be no more.

57
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,040
No more spider. Fuck them spiders. There were a couple of spiders in the ship. So if you're

58
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,560
wondering why everything is a mess, that's why. Yeah. We had to kill him. We had to get rid of him.

59
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:30,400
A couple of spiders here. Corpse is everywhere. I do not like spiders. I don't think any of us

60
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,000
have played beyond this point. So what happens after this is, is what happens. I have no idea.

61
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,000
I almost killed them because I was just letting fire to stop. Right. Okay. No more fire. I will

62
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,680
use fire with purpose. I promise. I will use fire. Okay. Are we ready to go out? Are we ready to go?

63
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:06,400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm at the hangar door. Where's the door? Okay. Okay. Okay. The glowing one.

64
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,640
We are exterminators from space. I think so. I don't think so. Oh my gosh. There's a spider

65
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:19,200
there. Did you see it? There's a morph spider. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. I'm burning everything.

66
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,440
Good job team. Burn it to death. There's a morph. What's a morph spider? Oh, what's this?

67
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,800
A what? Oh, what? What is that? Oh, that's the spider.

68
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Oh, it's big. What the heck? Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it.

69
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,880
Bitch. Okay. Did it die? It's dead. Yeah. Did you see it back in the spider? Yes.

70
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,760
What is that? Another one. Another one. There's another one. What the heck?

71
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,320
Wow. Okay. Um, wow. We're so good at this. Clearly, clearly the shooting skills are off.

72
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,400
We're tearing the weights to the rack. Oh, where is the rack? Oh my. Do you even lift,

73
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:07,040
bro? Wait, do you even lift? No, I don't. Wait, there's another one. Oh my god. Oh,

74
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:16,560
what the hell? Hey. Wait, they're cheating. Is it dying? Yeah, it's dying. Okay. There we go.

75
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,800
Okay. Right. We're going to, while you guys are doing that, I'm going to find the weights.

76
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:32,240
There's the weight here. There's the weight here. Oh my god. I can listen to music finally.

77
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,600
Wait, you can hear? I can listen to music. Oh, it's a crew log. Never mind. Fuck that.

78
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:46,800
No one wants to hear that shit. Fuck that. What the hell? I love organizing. Oh, I've got more ammo

79
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,240
for the flamethrower. Oh, what's this? Steep pods thing in the wool bur. I think that's how we open

80
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:02,960
the hanger doors. Oh, I see. Oh, should we go? Does anyone know where the other weight racks are?

81
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,200
We're missing. We're tearing weights to the rack. Oh, I found one. I found one. We need one more.

82
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,400
Oh, we can also go through here. We need one more. The store opened. Oh, I'm searching for this.

83
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,960
We need one more. We need one more weight, please. Oh, there's a tape here. I'm stuck.

84
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:26,960
It's a tape. You're stuck? It's okay. I got a tape. Ring the tape back. Oh, where's the last?

85
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,440
I can't find it. And the tape. Oh, wait, no. What? What are you doing? Where's the last?

86
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:42,800
I got a laser gun. A laser gun? A laser gun. Wait, only you get to keep it. How do you drop it?

87
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,200
Is there a way to drop it? Oh, it's shared. Oh, it's shared?

88
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,720
Press cute. Right. I'm taking the gun off and putting the laser on. Where's the last?

89
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,440
Where's the last one? The weight. Hold on. I'm coming back to help you with the weight. Where's the last one?

90
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,840
Is there anything I can shoot? There's a bunch of weights over here. Oh, wait. That's where we put the weights.

91
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:15,360
I'm sorry. Are they behind the freaking plant? Hold it. Oh, you've come. Are they?

92
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,400
Oh, I found it. It was right here. I found it. Oh, oh my god, we did it. There's another one.

93
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,400
Oh, another. It's more compound eggs. Oh, nice.

94
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,960
Okay, so then we're all good, right? No more spiders or objectives in this room. I mean,

95
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:46,960
aside from over here, but I think so. We need one more audio log. Yeah. Right, we can continue

96
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:56,320
doing this cheeky holy. Cheeky holy. Cheeky holy. See, if I have Scottish, that's what I was saying.

97
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,920
I was extremely keep speaking. I need to hear that. I need to hear your voice.

98
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,320
I was explaining. I was like, I don't really like using slang too much in case people don't understand

99
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,440
me, but I can make my accent like super hard to understand if you want. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

100
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,680
Right, all four of us are in at the hangar. We're currently hinting the spiders. We've

101
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,160
no got a clue what's about to welcome, but we're going to get our job done and then we'll get our

102
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:31,440
paycheck and we'll get it. Yes. Whoa. My car just exploded. What the hell? We started

103
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,000
talking about using the bridge and the hangar. It's okay. I could understand you. So I think

104
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,320
you could just speak however you want to speak. Yeah, everyone understood you. Don't worry. Yeah.

105
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,520
This is actually my real voice. I'm sorry. I've been mucking a bit for three months with that voice.

106
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,200
I can't be all straight anymore. All right, where'd you spray those ones?

107
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:00,320
That'll give me teleporter. You'll see. Well, oh, we need this assembler. I've just done fast travel

108
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:07,280
somewhere. Collect audio logs. A reflin says you're so good at accents. No, that's just my

109
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:14,800
actual accent. No, that's not good. Right, who wants to stand in the teleporter because I'm too scared.

110
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,720
I'll do it. It's over by here. I'm going up and down on the spot. If you come up,

111
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,560
I think this is a teleporter. And before you snag. No, I thought the teleporter was,

112
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:32,640
I thought the tele, oh, okay. Where are you? I'm back home. Wait, at the start of the map?

113
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,680
Yeah, yeah. Oh, it must be if you forget an objective and want to come back to do 100%.

114
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:45,520
Yeah. Yeah. Not the game devs being friendly. This game's early access. Like they've not finished it,

115
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:51,760
but the game devs are friendly like this. 10 out of 10. Oh, and there's another one here. I don't

116
00:13:51,760 --> 00:14:00,240
know how to see power conduit. Okay. So we need to find stuff to fix the teleporter right here,

117
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:09,360
the big one. And I think we need to visit the other rooms. Yeah. Our objective is debug the gate's

118
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:18,400
power converters. Yeah, above my pay grade. I signed up for I was just to do the spider killing.

119
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay. Oh, I got an achievement. What did you do? Solve the heart puzzle. Who did that? For you? I don't

120
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:34,480
know. I don't know who did that. You solved the riddle? I guess. Wow. What is that? Oh, my God. What

121
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,000
is this? Oh, I thought it was a key card, maybe. It looks like it, but wow.

122
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay. There's, but there's other places that we can go that's not this room, I think. Is there?

123
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,600
Yeah, there's another. Yeah. Data chip missing. We're missing a data chip. Oh, wait, we have a data

124
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:04,080
chip. Oh, wait, you? That was a data chip? It's on the floor. It goes where? Oh, where? I don't

125
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:12,720
know. Where? I don't know. I don't think this is it. Let me see. Let me see. What is that thing

126
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,000
lighting up? I'll go the data chip. You'll never guess. I think, Nate, you go a data chip. Return

127
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,560
to the terminal to activate it. This terminal? Is this terminal? It looks like a terminal.

128
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,160
I would assume everyone gets access. Only the host may perform this action.

129
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
Your finger that's green right now. Which one?

130
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,680
Oh, shit, look. My sensors have detected an abnormal concentration of spiders within a

131
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:54,560
construction site. What? No one is our tourist manner along with a human space fleet. Data chip

132
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,800
missing. Look at me. What? Jenna, don't do it. Jenna! Wait, what happened? What happened?

133
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:08,720
It's a screen die. Jenna, like, moonwalks into a portal and my screen went black. Oh, God. Oh, no.

134
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,600
There's spider webs. Oh, get the, get the, oh, do fire, do fire. They're everywhere. They're everywhere.

135
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,320
Oh, God, kill, kill, kill, kill, fire, fire. Fire, put the knob. Kill. We're actually just secretly

136
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:29,680
arsonists on our TAMO. Oh, it's just a zoo. Burn webs. Okay. Are they dead? No.

137
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:42,480
Oh, wait. No, that was a- How many webs did- Oh, we need four more. Four more cobble

138
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:49,600
Yeah, what the fuck is this supposed to be? What? Can we open doors? Is this a normal table or-

139
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,640
There's a door over here that we can go through. Oh, it's a fucking deer. Burning lands. Oh, it's a

140
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:01,120
deer. It's a deer head. I want to play a game. I want to play a game. Oh, we can open that chest now.

141
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,880
Wait, oh, you guys are over there. Oh, yeah, there's a chest. Yeah.

142
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,200
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, where did you guys go? There's a tent right here that we can open.

143
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,840
Wow, this house is so creepy. Guys, there's a vacuum. There's a vacuum. Everybody, there's a vacuum.

144
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:22,800
Oh, it's a cauldron. A vacuum? Which V-tubers rise up. A vacuum there. Oh, we should be tubing.

145
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:28,960
Oh, yeah. How did you guys get there? Wait, a door open. Can you guys see the spider or am I-

146
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,560
Is there a spider on me that you can see? I suck it. Oh, yeah. Yes. Oh, my gosh. Okay, thank you,

147
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:41,360
dude. I sucked it. This is like my third massive 10-foot spider randomly. Take it away. Don't worry

148
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,680
about it. They got you, Bresty. Oh, we have to brew the potion. Bresty. Bresty. Oh, shit. Oh,

149
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:54,160
shit. We got- There's some little hooligans over here. Two fires for a simmer, three for a bowl.

150
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:04,080
We have to fire up the one, two, three. Use the ladle to stir. Where's the ladle? I'm saving some

151
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:11,760
for ladle. Where's the ladle? I'm starting. Oh, Stranny has it. Stir it up. Okay. I'm stirring

152
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,280
the- It's working. It's actually working. Call me Gordon Ramsay because I'm not all ingredients

153
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,960
are in this room. Oh, my god, it exploded. Was that supposed to happen? Was that supposed to happen?

154
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,680
It wasn't me. It wasn't me on- You can't prove it. It wasn't me. I wasn't on the ladle.

155
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,840
You weren't okay. Oh, this beat- Oh, I think we might need to find another cauldron, but uh-

156
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,480
Wait, it's not just going to respawn. I don't know, but I think we need to- That's not how the world works.

157
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,560
Okay, cauldrons. Just don't respawn. Oh, how to reset your cauldron? Leave the room

158
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,120
close to the door behind you. Spin three times in a circle. Counterclockwise. Okay, okay, okay.

159
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,320
Yeah, and then we have to build- We have to make this potion. So,

160
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:02,080
okay, this is the recipe. Wait, we need to- I need to get out. Okay, counterclockwise.

161
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:11,280
One, two, three, four. Oh, my god, it's this. I'm really creative. I'm gonna give them that.

162
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,200
Okay, I'm not gonna mix it too hard this time. A simmer. Okay, so we just need to have two fires.

163
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,680
Okay, so we have the two. Okay, so we need an Ivan noot and a butterfly wing. I'm assuming this is a

164
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,520
noot eye versus a frog eye? The only alchemy experience I have is from Skyrim, and this

165
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:36,720
ain't like Skyrim. Okay. I guess. Never leave the room in the cauldron. Oh, that's what I did.

166
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,360
Not all ingredients are in this room. Oh, we're gonna have to go find-

167
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,680
So, I think this is the bead on, and we need the butterfly wing.

168
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,040
Wait, where are you guys seeing the straw? Okay, never mind, I'm blind.

169
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,840
There are no more. Wait, I'm an extinguished fire. Only two fires are on, which we need.

170
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:01,200
Yes, only two. We only need two. Oops. There's just two, don't worry. I added more.

171
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,240
Oh, no, no, no, but only two are on, so you're fine. Okay, okay.

172
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:18,880
Yeah, I already put in the- I put the noot eye and the beetle in there, but we need a butterfly-

173
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,880
Oh, here's the butterfly wing, and we have to wait until it turns brown.

174
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,520
He at a boil. Don't put that mushroom. No!

175
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,360
It's wrong. I thought you were supposed to be in a witchcraft. What's going on here?

176
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,680
Hold on a minute. I thought it was your lure. I'm sorry. I'm doing this too quickly.

177
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,480
Everyone out. We're still spinning at me.

178
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:56,320
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me- Okay, so if I have a noot, she seems to get it.

179
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,760
I'm like, Jenna's the smart one out. That's really good, but it's all coming, huh?

180
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,360
Let's really let her cook. Are you shifting your, like, free time as well, because that ain't-

181
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:14,240
I like cooking. Clearly. Oh, he at a boil until- Okay, so we have to do that,

182
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,680
and it has to turn brown before we can add anything else. Okay.

183
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,240
Watch it not work. Oh, it's brown! In a little mushroom, right? Yes.

184
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,360
Yeah. And we have to wait until that turns blue.

185
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,920
And then- And then who wants to stir vigorously until it turns orange?

186
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,440
As long as it has a little- A little, and I've not got anything.

187
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,800
Well, you have to wait for it to turn blue, or unless I did it wrong.

188
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,800
No, uh, I can't find the leader, though. Hello, Mr. Leader.

189
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,600
I found it. It's right here. It's right here. So you have to wait for it just to turn blue,

190
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,440
and then- Wait, when's the green soul? I don't know.

191
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,880
Yeah, boil. A boil with three flames. Is it on three flames?

192
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,640
Yeah, and there's three. And I put that mushroom in, so.

193
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,720
Oh, we do it too quickly. Is that all spiders back there?

194
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,600
Why did they make this so hard, bro? I feel like this is actually real.

195
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,160
I don't have any green souls for this. Can I go inside?

196
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,520
This thing, you want- Why are you boiling yourself?

197
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,040
So you can eat me. Oh, the dining room got unlocked?

198
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,520
Wow. Game's telling us to go elsewhere.

199
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,200
God, yeah, you're kicked up.

200
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,760
Okay, yeah. Yeah, we're just supposed to wait, I guess, but-

201
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,320
Right, make it blue, and then mushroom, right? Surely.

202
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Oh, no, no, it's not. Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it.

203
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,440
I'm shit, I'm shit. Where are you? Oh, no, let's turn our wrong one.

204
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,760
It's gone. I think it's off.

205
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,480
It's gone. I think it's off. Did it die? Yeah.

206
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,040
I think it's gone. Is it crawling on- What is spinning?

207
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,360
Yeah, that break it down. Can you see that physics?

208
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,920
Or is it just me that sees it? I think it's just you.

209
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,600
It's just another- No, no, it's break dancing for me on my POV.

210
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,640
Hit him with a ray gun.

211
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,720
Oh, it's hard. Yes.

212
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,320
Guys, there's like a skull here.

213
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,560
Is it moving? Yeah.

214
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,720
And the light was off, so I torched it, and now it's on.

215
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,240
Now it's on. Wow.

216
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,400
Good job. Maybe it's a secret.

217
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,280
Maybe it's a secret.

218
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,080
Oh, yeah. Totally an original idea.

219
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,680
Not chat, help.

220
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,640
Did the lucky charms help, be honest?

221
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,240
No, totally not. Tell us the truth.

222
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,160
We'll get out of here.

223
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,480
Okay, we'll come back to the waiting room.

224
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,480
Oh, yeah. Oh.

225
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,520
I opened the door.

226
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,240
Oh. Oh, I found the door challenge.

227
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,960
Right here. Oh.

228
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,480
Anyone- Oh, I'm a- Oh!

229
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,840
Oh, my God.

230
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,360
Why is it yellow?

231
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,240
Why is it me?

232
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,480
It's- What do you have against yellow?

233
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,320
There's a shotgun over here.

234
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,920
There's so much happening.

235
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,120
Stop them.

236
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,040
I'm getting wet.

237
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,840
I'm- Oh, my God.

238
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,160
It's like Minecraft when you hop to the spider web.

239
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,200
It slows you down, bruh.

240
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,080
Oh, we can open this door, too.

241
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,720
Oh.

242
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,640
I need the vacuum sucker.

243
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,480
Whoa. Oh, there's a spider on me, I think.

244
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,920
Um, wait. Oh, I killed it.

245
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,680
Hold on. My fire thing doesn't work anymore.

246
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,480
What now? It's over.

247
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,520
What the hell?

248
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,480
Oh, we'll need to find the door.

249
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,680
How do you get rid of the- Oh, no, you-

250
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,960
Oh, a teleporter.

251
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,360
I used the nearby portal to return to the Vindicator.

252
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,480
Oh.

253
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,960
But we can still collect stuff.

254
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,160
Unfinished business.

255
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,360
Beat him up, Junov.

256
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,000
All right.

257
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,640
Okay, fire up.

258
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,120
Wait up.

259
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,600
Fuck him up.

260
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,680
Beat him up.

261
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,640
I think it's dead.

262
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,520
Okay.

263
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,080
What's this?

264
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,280
They're so-

265
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,840
How do we get- How do we go up more fire?

266
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,400
What the hell?

267
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,400
Oh, there's another gate here.

268
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,360
Oh, upstairs.

269
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,840
Right.

270
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,560
I don't know.

271
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:06,880
Yeah.

272
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,080
No.

273
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:09,920
Wait, there's so much-

274
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,040
Oh, there's so much.

275
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,840
Access to-

276
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,760
Get your own bathroom.

277
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,600
Humongous wall.

278
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,480
This game is far too big.

279
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,320
I'm so- I literally thought it was going to be like one simplistic level.

280
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
We have teleport to a different realm.

281
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,880
We're on a train to the back.

282
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,680
How do I burn this down?

283
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,360
How do I burn this down?

284
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,480
Oh, there's something else here.

285
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,480
I need to play more.

286
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,240
Let us in.

287
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,080
Let us in.

288
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,520
No.

289
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,120
I'm going to shoot it.

290
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,840
It didn't work.

291
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,240
Access to hell.

292
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,440
Access to the bathroom.

293
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,480
No, hang on.

294
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,120
Yes?

295
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,600
For you.

296
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,040
Oh!

297
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,400
For me to hit you.

298
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,880
I love you.

299
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,400
I love you so much.

300
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,520
There's more here.

301
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,360
Johnny.

302
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,480
Oh, for me.

303
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,120
Oh, my gosh.

304
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,160
It's yellow as well.

305
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,120
It's so cute.

306
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,240
Oh, there's a-

307
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,720
There's a-

308
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,800
You guys, well, if you guys come back down,

309
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,960
there's a challenge thing,

310
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,680
but Emmie has to open it.

311
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,120
If you guys want to follow me real quick,

312
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,520
come here.

313
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,560
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

314
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,280
I don't want to walk faster.

315
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,320
Kill spiders is sniper rifle.

316
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,600
Where's the sniper rifle?

317
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,240
In the hand.

318
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,800
I can't use it.

319
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,360
What?

320
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:29,680
Hold on.

321
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,600
Did anybody get a sniper rifle?

322
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,240
I did.

323
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,800
Oh, Fire Emel.

324
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,040
Oh.

325
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,480
There's more Fire Emel here.

326
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,840
I don't know if anybody saw it or-

327
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,240
Where are you?

328
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,280
Where are you?

329
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,080
Here, here, here.

330
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,120
Oh, and-

331
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,680
Oh.

332
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,320
Did you pick up all of them?

333
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,600
Is it on the floor?

334
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,240
No.

335
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,120
Maybe it didn't.

336
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,040
No, it only went to you.

337
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,640
Oh, okay.

338
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,480
Then I'm going to get rid of the-

339
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:50,960
Okay.

340
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,960
All right, come here.

341
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,440
Come here.

342
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:54,960
Coming.

343
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,520
Hold.

344
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,160
Right here.

345
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,040
I'm going to get rid of all of the-

346
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,520
Yeah.

347
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,240
Look, look.

348
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,200
Ta-dang.

349
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,840
Ta-dang.

350
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,200
Haya-kyu.

351
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,920
Haya-kyu.

352
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,640
Oh, yeah.

353
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,440
High and seek.

354
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,600
Statue challenge.

355
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Extinguished hallway candles.

356
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,840
While evading the spider statue.

357
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,360
What?

358
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,720
Are we playing like-

359
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,920
How do we extinguish it?

360
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,240
Is it going to fall on us?

361
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,080
I don't-

362
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,640
Is this weeping angels with spiders?

363
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,840
Oh, you do have to put fire on it.

364
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,240
Yeah, I found one.

365
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,360
Everybody get ready.

366
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,400
Everybody get ready.

367
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,120
I'm sniping at-

368
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,480
Is it going to start chasing us?

369
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,240
I think so.

370
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,560
Oh, yeah.

371
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:34,960
There's-

372
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,200
Okay.

373
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,800
Oh, extinguish them.

374
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,240
So we have to take the fire away.

375
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,680
I extinguished two.

376
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:40,960
Oh.

377
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,200
Yeah.

378
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,640
I ran out of fire.

379
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,560
Jenna, you're actually 100 IQ.

380
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:44,880
You-

381
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,760
Wait, what?

382
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,800
Then they also pop.

383
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,600
It is-

384
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,160
It is-

385
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,880
It's squids.

386
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,360
We did it.

387
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,600
Is it a weeping angel?

388
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,880
Yeah, it is.

389
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,440
I looked away and then it got me.

390
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,080
We did it.

391
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,480
Okay, let me see if there is-

392
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,040
I hope we get the challenge.

393
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,160
I need spiders because-

394
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,040
Wait, we did it?

395
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah.

396
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,400
Oh, thank you.

397
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:02,720
Yeah.

398
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,280
Like, Jenna.

399
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:03,920
But I died.

400
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,080
But I died.

401
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,680
You died?

402
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,640
Oh, it's okay.

403
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,360
Wait, are you dumb?

404
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,480
I know.

405
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,200
You're alive.

406
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,480
You're alive?

407
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,360
I'm back, yes.

408
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,520
Yeah.

409
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,000
Oh, right.

410
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,080
I want to kill the spiders with the sniper rifles.

411
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,640
But if you kill five, then you get another date.

412
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,120
Come here.

413
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,320
I have the sniper rifle.

414
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:20,880
Oh, there's another-

415
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,120
How do I get it to fire?

416
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,840
Oh, you have one too.

417
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,000
Oh, wait.

418
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,560
I have one.

419
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,040
Okay.

420
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,680
I did have one.

421
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,240
Oh, you do?

422
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,360
There's a skull here.

423
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,240
It's a skull, skull, skull.

424
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,000
Can I give-

425
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,800
Light them up.

426
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,200
Light them up.

427
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,680
You can light it up.

428
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,400
I don't know where to find more spiders.

429
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,040
I'm empty.

430
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,840
I'm empty.

431
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,600
Light this up?

432
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,360
Yeah, light it up.

433
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:41,760
There we go.

434
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,240
Yeah!

435
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,000
What does it do?

436
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,080
I have no idea.

437
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,800
Oh, okay.

438
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,000
Kill spiders with the sniper rifle.

439
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,240
Great.

440
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,440
I'm looking for sputters.

441
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,400
There has to be.

442
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,040
Okay, okay.

443
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,600
There's a sputter there.

444
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,960
I don't know how to find them.

445
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,160
Wait, here, here, here.

446
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,400
There's a spider here.

447
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,000
Need a quarter somewhere?

448
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,080
Oh, it's in the clock.

449
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,560
It's in the clock.

450
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,120
It's in the clock.

451
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,680
It's in the clock.

452
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,240
It's in the clock.

453
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,680
Oh, I got the rifle out.

454
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,960
I got the rifle out.

455
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,520
Here.

456
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:11,840
Get it.

457
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,240
Kill it.

458
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,320
Kill it.

459
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,960
Kill it.

460
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,440
Kill it.

461
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:13,840
Kill it.

462
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,840
Oh, my God.

463
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,040
Oh, my God.

464
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,080
Let me give you the rifle.

465
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,120
Someone give me the rifle.

466
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,040
Let me get the rifle.

467
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,680
It's cute.

468
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,280
Press Q to equip the rifle.

469
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,000
Press Q to equip it.

470
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,480
Okay.

471
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,200
It should be like great save metal.

472
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,080
Oh.

473
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,760
Did you kill it?

474
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,080
No, no.

475
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,720
It's under the piano.

476
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,680
Piano, piano.

477
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,560
Chair, chair.

478
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,920
Chair, chair.

479
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,920
It's under the freaking chair.

480
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,720
Okay. Red seat.

481
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,120
Red seat.

482
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,680
Red seat.

483
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,160
Red seat.

484
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,800
Double seat.

485
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,120
Single.

486
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,600
I killed it.

487
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,000
Yes.

488
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,160
Oh, yes.

489
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,880
Oh, yes.

490
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,520
Oh, my God.

491
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,280
I don't think we need a...

492
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,760
You don't need...

493
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,720
I don't think you just zoom in.

494
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,080
I think it's pretty accurate.

495
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,680
Yeah.

496
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,160
Maybe.

497
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,120
We're running about though.

498
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,400
Okay.

499
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,120
Let's see if I can...

500
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,240
Oh, it's almost from a sniper?

501
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,640
Bruh.

502
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,360
Oh, this game.

503
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:57,600
Okay.

504
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,960
Oh, there's another flame.

505
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,600
Wait.

506
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,800
Is this an event?

507
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,120
Let me see.

508
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,320
Let me try to do this.

509
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,080
I have a newt.

510
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,480
Selfie.

511
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,240
You're turning the fire off, Mr. Vent.

512
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,000
There's a fire wave.

513
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,480
Oh, I see.

514
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,880
I don't know how to turn the vents off.

515
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,880
And a beetle.

516
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,840
Interference.

517
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,680
There's a morph spider nearby.

518
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,000
Right.

519
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,120
So it must be something else.

520
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,320
A morph spider.

521
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,160
Oh, it's one of those big ones.

522
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,360
Yeah, that come from IOM.

523
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:29,440
It's just the background.

524
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,640
True and bad girl.

525
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,120
Oh, no.

526
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,280
Are you a morph spider?

527
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,600
I'm so confused.

528
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,920
Is this the small mushroom?

529
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,240
Nope.

530
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,200
Nope.

531
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,720
The mushroom is probably like a big shroom.

532
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,240
No, no.

533
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,640
Really?

534
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,680
No, it was a tiny one,

535
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,360
but now there's no more small ones.

536
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:49,920
I...

537
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,520
Did they respawn every time we were in the small mushroom?

538
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,320
There's more here.

539
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,920
Is it one of these?

540
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,320
No, no.

541
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,000
That's a regular sized one.

542
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,480
So it's a big one.

543
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,760
I think what it was, it didn't turn blue.

544
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,800
Once it turned...

545
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,600
Wait, no.

546
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,480
No, actually, you're right.

547
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,840
Heat until it turns brown,

548
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,120
then add the mushroom.

549
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,920
Yeah, and then...

550
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,160
Yeah.

551
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,800
Oh, it says heat out of...

552
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,160
Oh, royal rolling?

553
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,720
A rolling boil?

554
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,880
Oh, I guess four is rolling boil.

555
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,280
Does that mean put the flames back to two in the summer?

556
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,800
No, I think it was like I had to put all four on.

557
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,200
Okay.

558
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,000
Okay, bro, but I have no more small...

559
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,800
Oh, there is one.

560
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,600
Okay, get out.

561
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,160
Get out.

562
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,720
Get out.

563
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,040
I'm a...

564
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,360
I'm a...

565
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:29,920
I'm a...

566
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,960
I'm a clockwise flame.

567
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,880
Spin on it, clockwise.

568
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,840
Okay, we got this.

569
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,320
We got this.

570
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:34,720
Wait, that's...

571
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,040
Is it in?

572
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,200
Okay, here.

573
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,600
I'm just...

574
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,320
I have a new...

575
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,120
Yeah.

576
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,680
I'm just...

577
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,560
Oh, I was...

578
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,360
Stand back.

579
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,920
Stand back.

580
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,040
It says there's spiders here,

581
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,920
but they're all dead.

582
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,560
Oh, no, that's what I'm saying.

583
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,000
Mine says there's one right in front of me.

584
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,760
Yeah, but they're dead.

585
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,400
Yeah, I don't know how to find them.

586
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,000
They're pretending to be dead.

587
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,480
All right.

588
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,640
Oh, he's on me.

589
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,160
Well, if anyone went to the floor,

590
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,040
I know he might be...

591
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,800
This guy?

592
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,520
Yeah, you're just...

593
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,640
You're just being the showroom, you know?

594
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,880
This is like, you've got 10 wax to go, thanks.

595
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,000
This is what I was supposed to do.

596
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,400
Oh, it's blue.

597
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:14,880
It turned blue.

598
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,360
It turned blue.

599
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,440
It turned blue.

600
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,080
Yeah.

601
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,320
Oh!

602
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,680
And that has to turn orange.

603
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,880
It says what I was supposed to do.

604
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,240
Bring to Rumble until it turns blue.

605
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,320
Stir vigorously until potion turns orange.

606
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,040
Stir vigorously.

607
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,520
Stir vigorously.

608
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,640
Stir vigorously.

609
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,520
Vigorously.

610
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,720
Vigorously.

611
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,840
Stir vigorously.

612
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,600
I don't know how to laugh.

613
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,480
Let her kick.

614
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,760
Let her kick.

615
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,240
Keep going.

616
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,640
Keep going.

617
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,600
Oh, my God.

618
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,960
But don't leave the ladle in.

619
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,920
Don't leave the ladle in.

620
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
Or else it'll laugh at you.

621
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,320
Yeah, just turn vigorously.

622
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,440
But it's from the outside.

623
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,360
You look like it's not going inside.

624
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,440
You'll be like, you're just been three, six,

625
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,120
you'll be learning it when it comes to this, right?

626
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,520
Oh, like this.

627
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,400
Okay.

628
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,160
Bro.

629
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,040
Vigorously.

630
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,320
How does it do this?

631
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,640
How does it not?

632
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:00,960
Yes!

633
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,440
How do you register it not?

634
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,120
I don't know.

635
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,800
This one's just going crazy for me.

636
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,240
Yeah, like this.

637
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,880
Like this.

638
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,440
Oh, wait.

639
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,080
No.

640
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,440
Like, can you rotate it?

641
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,960
Like the bottom of it to go in?

642
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,320
I can hear it splashing.

643
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,680
So you are doing it.

644
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:20,880
Yeah.

645
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,840
Make it splash vigorously.

646
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,640
I can roll stand back just in case it explodes again.

647
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,400
We're like, no.

648
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,000
I don't want to mess it up.

649
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,760
How is that not done?

650
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,560
Is this a prank?

651
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,680
Are you being pranked?

652
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,080
I'm sorry.

653
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,120
Does it need to be in the cauldron?

654
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,720
I feel like it might need to be in the cauldron.

655
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,480
They're vigorously until it turns on.

656
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,920
It's in the cauldron for me.

657
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,520
Ball portion with E.

658
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,800
Oh, my gosh.

659
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,880
Firmly compress it.

660
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,640
I got spider.

661
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,520
You got it.

662
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:57,760
Yeah.

663
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,280
You've got grenades for sputters now.

664
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,400
Where?

665
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,120
Oh, spider.

666
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,280
A new thing open.

667
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,040
More pump that day.

668
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,600
Nice.

669
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,040
That was so hard.

670
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,480
What do we do with the spider potion, though?

671
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,360
They just.

672
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,560
I think it's a grenade.

673
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,720
Oh, god, it was a spider.

674
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,680
Oh, my gosh.

675
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,240
Clio.

676
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,880
Oh, my gosh.

677
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,440
Come here.

678
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:19,920
Come here.

679
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,480
Come here.

680
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:20,960
Come here.

681
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,440
Come here.

682
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,080
Come here.

683
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,560
Come here.

684
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,120
Come here.

685
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,200
Come here.

686
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:23,920
Everybody, please.

687
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,880
This is clear.

688
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,080
No, don't do it.

689
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,800
Don't do it.

690
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,760
Please don't do it.

691
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,600
Please, don't tell anyone.

692
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,320
I got it.

693
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,400
She's so cute.

694
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,600
Oh, you're back.

695
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,520
I'm never touching this potion again.

696
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,840
Are we supposed to go in the vents or something?

697
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:42,960
For that?

698
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,920
Oh, maybe.

699
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,720
Oh, that's so smart.

700
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:47,840
Wait.

701
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,320
Hold on.

702
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,880
I'm chugging.

703
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,920
Don't mind me.

704
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,480
OK.

705
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,120
I'm going to become.

706
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,960
How do I jump on a wall?

707
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:54,960
What?

708
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,720
It looked like it worked for a second.

709
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,880
Oh, I didn't.

710
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,120
Wait.

711
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,840
Can I go again?

712
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,120
What about the bigger one?

713
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,080
What about the smaller one?

714
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,640
What's this?

715
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,720
Heavy.

716
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,520
Oh, you got an amour.

717
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:06,960
Amour.

718
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,440
I can't go back to being a wee spider again.

719
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,240
Doesn't he like it?

720
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,520
Oh, wait.

721
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,400
I tell you why.

722
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,120
They choose me.

723
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,440
I'm off.

724
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,040
So, like, can you go refill the spider potion?

725
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,560
I assume.

726
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,120
I can lunge, apparently.

727
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,800
And then I can watch you all.

728
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,640
What is this?

729
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,040
Oh, wait.

730
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,520
Can you go away?

731
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,080
Wait, it's Johnny.

732
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,480
Come here.

733
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,280
Can you go here?

734
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,400
Can you go in through here?

735
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,280
There's a phone.

736
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,080
Oh, the bathroom.

737
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,840
Yeah, the bathroom.

738
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,040
Can you go in the bathroom?

739
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,600
Let me try.

740
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,680
Everyone, there's a phone and it's shining.

741
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,880
There's a what?

742
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,280
Take it.

743
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,040
Oh, there's a timer.

744
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,360
Hold on.

745
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:43,920
There's a timer.

746
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,040
But I know exactly what you mean.

747
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,800
I think I'm going to open it on the other side.

748
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,240
What is your timer?

749
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,960
Someone says accurate lit for consize.

750
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,460
Ooh.

751
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,760
Reefless.

752
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,400
Nice.

753
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,640
Oh, yeah.

754
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,280
This was that.

755
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:55,680
Hold it.

756
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:55,840
Hold it.

757
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,000
Hold it.

758
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,480
Hold it.

759
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,360
Hold it.

760
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,320
Hold it.

761
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,880
We did it.

762
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,360
We did it.

763
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,840
I got it.

764
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,120
It's like, I can't open the door.

765
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,760
There we go.

766
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,000
Oh, there's a spider in here.

767
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,200
Come here.

768
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,000
It's on me.

769
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,400
I'll just throw an open eye in.

770
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,960
You'll be fine.

771
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,920
You'll be fine.

772
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,920
You'll be fine.

773
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,800
There you go.

774
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,080
Okay.

775
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,360
Okay.

776
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,240
I'm going to use this.

777
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,840
Is this blue?

778
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,320
It's also shiny.

779
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,440
It's the portions we can brew.

780
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,200
What?

781
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,280
Um, I made a brew in that.

782
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,080
It's shiny.

783
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,880
Oh.

784
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,080
Do you know what this means?

785
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,160
Do you know what this means?

786
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,560
And again?

787
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,480
We're a different team.

788
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,280
All right, buddy.

789
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,560
We need to access the bedroom.

790
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,880
Where is the bedroom?

791
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,480
Um, this one?

792
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,080
There's no hole in to get inside there.

793
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,360
There is the, there's the, whoa.

794
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,600
There's a more spider.

795
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,880
That was who was in this area.

796
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,440
Stop it.

797
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,840
Spank that naughty spider.

798
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,360
It's got so much vitamins in it.

799
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,240
He's so healthy.

800
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,240
It's got what?

801
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,040
Vitamins.

802
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,680
Vitamins.

803
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,920
Oh, how do you say it?

804
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,880
Vitamins.

805
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,800
Slaithers source to rest.

806
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,840
What does that mean?

807
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,680
Kill all the spiders.

808
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,960
Fume the skulls?

809
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,160
Sanctity of the skulls?

810
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:14,960
Sorry.

811
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,600
I should have said Flintstone gummies

812
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,960
or whatever they're called.

813
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,520
That's right.

814
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,480
I'm coming for you.

815
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,760
Big Flintstone gummies.

816
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,560
Oh, the shiny stuff.

817
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,400
Bring them over to the people.

818
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:30,560
Yeah.

819
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,320
Oh, the shiny stuff here.

820
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,800
Oh, wait.

821
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:33,840
Shiny.

822
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,200
They went over to the people.

823
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,640
Oh, it's not a tube of glue.

824
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,360
And, uh, okay.

825
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,800
So we need two more shiny things.

826
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,240
Where did this one goes here?

827
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:44,880
There's one out here.

828
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,400
You're just kind of scattered around.

829
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,720
How do we go inside?

830
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,600
I've got a teapot.

831
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,960
I don't know.

832
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,840
Probably we have to get the footprints.

833
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,440
Is anyone British by any chance?

834
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,560
Is anyone British?

835
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,400
We're at the other shiny things for you.

836
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,680
I don't know.

837
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,480
I only found two.

838
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,760
Or these two?

839
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,120
Yeah.

840
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,320
Oh, okay.

841
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,200
Hold on.

842
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,880
If they were on this table, then yes.

843
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,600
Wait, only two.

844
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,120
We need sparkly things for the momentum.

845
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,440
Worry.

846
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,080
Sparkle.

847
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:12,640
Sparkle.

848
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,120
Sparkle.

849
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,920
Sparkle.

850
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,960
What is this?

851
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,200
Right.

852
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,240
Be a magpie.

853
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,600
Sunsparkly in Chinese.

854
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,480
Sunsparkly.

855
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,440
Yes, ma'am.

856
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,520
Where are all these people in the pictures?

857
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,320
They're the people who used to live in the house.

858
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,880
Oh, did the spiders eat them?

859
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,480
Probably.

860
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,160
Delicious.

861
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,920
We need to find more sparklies.

862
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,160
I'm having a new look going on shiny.

863
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,920
How did you find two shinies in a row?

864
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,280
I don't know.

865
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,560
Oh, Fuyo custom.

866
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,120
Because she's a leprechaun.

867
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,600
Oh, that's real?

868
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:56,720
Real.

869
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,160
A grubby little hand.

870
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,960
They're waving me.

871
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,920
They're waving me.

872
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,120
Where is it?

873
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,000
Replay challenge.

874
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,640
Absolutely no.

875
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,720
I'm not doing the weeping spiders from the door.

876
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,640
Maybe it could be inside of some drawer.

877
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,720
Oh, maybe.

878
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,760
Is it just me?

879
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,880
Or the color is turning black?

880
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,960
I think it could be from two.

881
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,400
Yeah, it's because we burned the base.

882
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,400
Okay.

883
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,280
Can you manually destroy cobwebs or just have to be with fire?

884
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,200
I think it has to be with fire.

885
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,680
Oh, I think it also works with the, oh no, never mind.

886
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,800
I thought I could back them in.

887
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,960
It's not working.

888
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,880
It says there's a more spider right here.

889
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,760
What the heck?

890
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,400
Wait, no.

891
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,360
It's gone.

892
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,800
Maybe I'm behind someone.

893
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,680
Oh, can you still turn into a spider?

894
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,760
Yes.

895
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,400
Come over here.

896
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,040
Come over here.

897
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,120
I found the bedroom, I think.

898
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,240
I found the bedroom, I think.

899
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,240
Oh, oh my God.

900
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,680
You are smart.

901
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,120
Is there another circle?

902
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,840
It's up here.

903
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,280
It's a hole.

904
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,760
Oh.

905
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,960
In the ceiling.

906
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,920
Go, go, go.

907
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,200
You do for you.

908
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,920
For you.

909
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,880
For you.

910
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,920
Open the door for us.

911
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,400
Go, go, go.

912
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,600
Go, go, go, go.

913
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,640
Oh, oh.

914
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,440
Is it up there?

915
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,960
I can do some sick jumps.

916
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,920
Did you see that?

917
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,960
You're getting some air.

918
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,680
I'm not going to lie.

919
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,880
You're getting some air time.

920
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,000
Yeah.

921
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,880
Oh, why did you jump off from the?

922
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,600
Again.

923
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,200
You turned it into a human and jumping on the table was so cute.

924
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,440
Oh my God.

925
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,360
Wait, why does it cool down?

926
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:40,960
Wait, hold on.

927
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,680
I'll try it.

928
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,960
All right, let's go.

929
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,760
Go, go, go.

930
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,960
Do not do it.

931
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,760
You have to aim off.

932
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,320
Oh, fuck.

933
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:46,560
Oh.

934
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,080
Amy, you want to hear us talk?

935
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,200
Sure.

936
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,160
How do I do it?

937
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,520
Number six.

938
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,040
Number six.

939
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,560
Number six is a gun.

940
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,560
He says to press Q and find the potion.

941
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,360
Oh, sorry.

942
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,120
My, my number six.

943
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,440
Okay.

944
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,360
All spider potions.

945
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,720
All right, Junna's going for it again.

946
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,680
Junna, go, Junna.

947
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,520
Junna, give me, Junna.

948
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,560
Give me, Junna.

949
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,400
Oh, you have first spider to get it.

950
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,280
Face it.

951
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,080
How do I jump?

952
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,560
Oh, you're doing it again.

953
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,000
Can I climb up walls?

954
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,960
That's so stupid.

955
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,960
Wait, it only lets you like leap on the wall.

956
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,320
Honestly, thank God they couldn't.

957
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,480
Lunge.

958
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:27,760
What?

959
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,160
Oh, wow.

960
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,000
It really doesn't let you do that.

961
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,400
What?

962
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,280
How are you so,

963
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,360
so there's another game mode in this game

964
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,160
where you like be the spider and hide from each other.

965
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,200
But we decided to do the campaign.

966
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:41,840
But this is.

967
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,560
I did it.

968
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,360
I did it.

969
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,000
You did it.

970
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,360
Oh, nice.

971
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:45,920
Whoa.

972
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,640
Open the door.

973
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,440
Can you open the door?

974
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,040
I think so.

975
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,560
Hello.

976
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,280
Oh my God.

977
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,360
Hold on.

978
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,640
I'm directionally challenged.

979
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,520
How did you make it there?

980
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,080
Get down.

981
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,960
Up the stairs.

982
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,400
To the left.

983
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:00,960
To the left.

984
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,440
Everybody.

985
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,560
I need one more shiny thing.

986
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,720
More spider.

987
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,440
Beat him up.

988
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,000
Kill it.

989
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,480
Kill it.

990
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:08,960
Kill it.

991
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,440
Kill it.

992
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,160
Okay.

993
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,880
I think it's dead.

994
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,560
One more.

995
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,120
One more.

996
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:13,840
Ha ha ha ha.

997
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,400
Another one.

998
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,360
Oh, we freaked us out.

999
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:15,680
Okay.

1000
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,160
Wait, does Juna count if we kill her?

1001
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,760
If we kill ourselves as spiders,

1002
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,360
does that count towards the circle?

1003
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:23,760
No, no.

1004
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,960
You tried to kill Fuyah.

1005
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,520
Maybe.

1006
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:26,480
No.

1007
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,320
It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

1008
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,920
I need one more sparkly thing.

1009
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,720
What's with the two spiders?

1010
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,200
Spider saved.

1011
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,960
The one in here.

1012
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,000
Dab it.

1013
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,600
Okay.

1014
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,640
Hmm?

1015
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,440
Are you going to or?

1016
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,440
No, it's a broom.

1017
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,680
Oh, it looks like an oar.

1018
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,440
Whoa, that is sort.

1019
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,560
That looks like an oar.

1020
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,440
Oh, spider.

1021
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:49,920
Oh.

1022
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,160
Winch.

1023
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,880
Wrench.

1024
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,280
Spank.

1025
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:53,920
There's a wrench.

1026
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,480
Okay.

1027
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,200
What's in here?

1028
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,240
Is that a weapon?

1029
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,560
Was the wrench a sparkly?

1030
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,120
Money.

1031
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,760
Space box?

1032
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,320
There's currently.

1033
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:05,760
Oh.

1034
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,320
Create new weapons from.

1035
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,520
I can't even see anything.

1036
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm webbed.

1037
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,400
What is that?

1038
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:12,960
Holy shit.

1039
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,360
It was huge.

1040
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,520
It's a plant, but it's spider shaped.

1041
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,400
Oh.

1042
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:16,880
We got it.

1043
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,320
I'll put it on the bed.

1044
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,200
They pranked me, bro.

1045
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,640
No, no, no, no.

1046
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,960
I'm destroying everything in this.

1047
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,720
Dude, do you like the taste of that potion?

1048
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,000
Yeah, I really do, trust.

1049
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,000
I need to find the last shiny.

1050
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,240
Yes.

1051
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,320
Oh, yeah.

1052
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,280
Suck me for you.

1053
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,520
Oh, you became baby.

1054
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,240
Hey.

1055
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:38,560
Yeah.

1056
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,880
Does that intimidate you?

1057
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,560
Yes, a bit.

1058
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,000
Oh, you need four potions?

1059
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,400
One more shiny.

1060
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,440
Oh, we need to make four different potions.

1061
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Yeah, I don't know how to make more, though.

1062
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,200
It says needle drop.

1063
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:57,920
Play it again.

1064
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,960
Exterminator?

1065
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,720
What is that on the objective?

1066
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,800
It's on the other page of the objective.

1067
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,840
I need to go again.

1068
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,080
Okay.

1069
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,240
Play it again.

1070
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:08,400
Exterminator.

1071
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,440
What is in this room?

1072
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,920
Need to go drop.

1073
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,960
Maybe it's the...

1074
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,560
There's a record player here.

1075
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,560
Is it shiny?

1076
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,960
It's not shiny, but...

1077
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,200
Shiny doko.

1078
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,720
I keep accidentally drinking it.

1079
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,600
It's like second nature now.

1080
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,600
The other one actually did not make this easy.

1081
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,120
That's called an addiction, Juno.

1082
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,400
Addiction.

1083
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:40,640
Oh.

1084
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,320
I don't know how to respond.

1085
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,040
Do we have to go back to the potion room to make more potions?

1086
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,360
Yeah, but we need more recipes.

1087
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,760
Can you do the same thing when we're over it at my cone?

1088
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,280
I think it has to be different ones.

1089
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,000
Does anyone have rifle ammo?

1090
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,960
Upgrade module?

1091
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,600
Oh, wait, I do.

1092
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,200
Because we still have to kill spiders.

1093
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,920
We still have to kill former spiders with the rifle.

1094
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,040
There's a spider here.

1095
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,760
Oh, yeah.

1096
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,200
There's one here on the chest.

1097
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,120
Strony looks for Strony.

1098
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,080
Strony's tracking it.

1099
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,520
Beep, beep, beep.

1100
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,320
I'm following it.

1101
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,000
It's on me.

1102
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,000
Shoot it.

1103
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,480
Shoot it.

1104
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:24,640
Shoot it.

1105
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,200
No, it's here.

1106
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:25,600
It's here.

1107
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,080
It's on the floor.

1108
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:26,640
Oh.

1109
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:27,680
It's on the floor.

1110
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,320
It's on the floor.

1111
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,520
It's on the floor.

1112
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,280
Wait, where did it go?

1113
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:31,920
Behind you.

1114
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,800
Uh, red chair?

1115
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,280
Behind you.

1116
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:33,440
Red.

1117
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:33,920
Uh, uh, uh.

1118
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,480
Where would we find more recipes?

1119
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,120
Yes!

1120
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:37,840
Fire ammo.

1121
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,680
Should we get it?

1122
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,080
Yes.

1123
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,200
Three more left.

1124
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,560
I assume they're going to keep the Strony.

1125
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,040
Hello.

1126
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,360
Hello, hello.

1127
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,960
Oh, wait, do you guys have any idea

1128
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,880
like where to find more recipes?

1129
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,720
In a book?

1130
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,120
There's a more spider in Jenna's room

1131
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,480
to the right somewhere.

1132
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,880
If you want to snipe it with a sniper,

1133
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,600
it's, yeah.

1134
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,360
Where?

1135
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,000
Here's her items.

1136
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,000
It's somewhere here.

1137
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,800
It's teasing.

1138
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,000
Hmm.

1139
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,040
It may be up.

1140
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,760
It may be up.

1141
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,640
There he is.

1142
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,360
I got him.

1143
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,000
Oops.

1144
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,040
He's here somewhere.

1145
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,080
There he is.

1146
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,280
Oh, he's on me.

1147
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:17,760
Okay.

1148
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,480
Can you scope Jenna without taking her head off?

1149
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,000
I don't have a head off.

1150
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,200
I don't have a head off.

1151
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:23,600
I don't have a head off.

1152
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:23,680
I don't have a head off.

1153
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,240
I don't have a head off.

1154
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:24,800
I don't have a head off.

1155
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,840
I don't have a head off.

1156
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,560
Oh, Nate.

1157
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,480
Nice.

1158
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,400
There is another one as well.

1159
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,720
I'm here because my jammer's still blocked.

1160
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,440
Who is it?

1161
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,200
Just smack everything.

1162
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:39,760
Literally.

1163
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,520
I'm just touching everything.

1164
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,640
Is it under the floor?

1165
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,520
I mean, under the chair?

1166
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,720
I found it.

1167
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:47,840
Oh, wait.

1168
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,600
Nate, that motherfucker's playing.

1169
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,080
Snipe it.

1170
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,120
Oh, he's stuck in here if you want to touch it.

1171
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,560
He's touched it.

1172
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,440
And then there's one more behind us here,

1173
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,560
somewhere behind the chair.

1174
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,440
And we have one more bullet.

1175
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,760
No pressure.

1176
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,800
Oh, I found it.

1177
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,280
It's on.

1178
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,000
It's on Amy.

1179
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,720
Can you snipe it with her?

1180
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:10,960
Oh, I see it.

1181
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,840
It's on my face.

1182
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,200
Okay.

1183
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:13,600
Okay.

1184
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:13,920
One more.

1185
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,000
Show me.

1186
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,560
No.

1187
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,200
Do it.

1188
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:15,840
Wait.

1189
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,560
It's on your back.

1190
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,440
It's moving a lot.

1191
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:17,920
Show me.

1192
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:19,680
Hold on.

1193
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:20,640
Hold on.

1194
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,520
Hold on.

1195
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,160
Don't move.

1196
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,280
Don't move.

1197
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,040
Don't move already.

1198
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,560
No.

1199
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,040
Okay.

1200
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,000
Boy, oh, that was amazing.

1201
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,840
What was that?

1202
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,200
That's the last freaking bullet.

1203
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:35,840
You did it.

1204
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,280
Yeah.

1205
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:37,840
Oh, my God.

1206
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,280
Got more fire, Evel.

1207
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,880
We can unlock something now.

1208
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,280
I don't know what, but something on the map's not even locked.

1209
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,160
Because let me see.

1210
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,800
Oh, not that we have to fire.

1211
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,760
Maybe we have to like light up all the candles quickly

1212
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,960
so that the thing doesn't get them off.

1213
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,880
It's just work on pound eggs.

1214
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,200
Oh.

1215
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,560
Oh.

1216
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,040
Oh, wait.

1217
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,080
We have enough compound.

1218
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:58,720
We can go outside.

1219
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,520
Oh, to go up.

1220
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,480
Yeah.

1221
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:00,880
Yeah.

1222
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,040
Maybe that's where the last shiny thing is.

1223
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,760
Yeah, maybe.

1224
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,840
Here, here, here, here.

1225
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,240
Oh, wrong one.

1226
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:08,720
Where is it?

1227
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:09,920
I swear to God.

1228
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,600
There was like a seven one somewhere.

1229
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:12,480
Oh.

1230
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,040
Is that race following us?

1231
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,240
Am I going crazy?

1232
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,440
Is what, following us?

1233
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,800
That's a race.

1234
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,160
Where did you guys find the thing?

1235
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,200
The photography thing.

1236
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,200
I don't know.

1237
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,720
Oh, I found that one.

1238
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,440
I found that one.

1239
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:27,840
You did?

1240
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:28,640
Yeah.

1241
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,840
Okay, so we're just missing one.

1242
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,000
We're just missing one.

1243
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,520
Yeah, no.

1244
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,640
He goes in this up because he's an explorer.

1245
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,800
That tricycle is moving.

1246
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,680
I'm not being funny.

1247
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,960
That tricycle's moving.

1248
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:41,920
I don't need to.

1249
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,880
Yeah, it is.

1250
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,720
The tricycle?

1251
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,600
You guys are going crazy.

1252
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,320
No, it's totally.

1253
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,000
No, it is.

1254
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,880
If you look away.

1255
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,360
Everyone look away from the tricycle.

1256
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,200
I want to play a game.

1257
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,080
Okay, look in the way.

1258
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,920
Yes, he sees me.

1259
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,560
I told you.

1260
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,360
Okay, okay.

1261
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,320
Stop looking at it.

1262
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,840
And just let's just see where it goes.

1263
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,560
I think it just tries to come up to us.

1264
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,840
It probably just follows you.

1265
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,000
Oh my God, it's turning for you.

1266
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:08,960
Wait, okay.

1267
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,160
I'm sitting on the table as well.

1268
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:10,800
I'm scared of that.

1269
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,560
I'm looking away, but I'll be on the table.

1270
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,560
Where is it?

1271
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:16,880
Okay, I look away.

1272
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,840
Is it going to take us to like some shadow realm

1273
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,960
if it touches us?

1274
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,160
Oh, it stopped moving.

1275
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,040
It stopped moving.

1276
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,720
I wonder if it's too close.

1277
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,440
It might be too close to it.

1278
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,560
It just wants to play.

1279
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,160
It just wants friends.

1280
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,680
It's freaking moving while I'm looking at it.

1281
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,480
I swear.

1282
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,800
I swear there was a room that was like,

1283
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,000
you could open it once you had like seven, maybe.

1284
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,760
I've got a 12 one here at the ball.

1285
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,400
Any more holes in the ceiling

1286
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,920
that we can spider into?

1287
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,640
Maybe.

1288
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,360
Oh, maybe.

1289
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,000
Maybe, maybe.

1290
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,640
I don't know what to do.

1291
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,920
Also, does anybody have a way to remove

1292
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,600
planks from the walls?

1293
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,560
I don't know.

1294
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,160
It only lets us grab it when the nails are on the other side.

1295
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,480
Like if the nail, if you can visually see the nails,

1296
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,520
I think we can take it.

1297
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,160
We have to play the record?

1298
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,880
The record?

1299
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,920
Oh my God, please.

1300
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,640
Please hand hold.

1301
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,520
Please stream snipe.

1302
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,480
Yes, please.

1303
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,600
There's something in there.

1304
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,920
Someone just said, oh, nobody played the record yet.

1305
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,560
So I thought.

1306
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,120
Wait, hold on.

1307
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,400
There was a record upstairs.

1308
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,200
I was touching it.

1309
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:29,680
There was.

1310
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,120
Oh, get it.

1311
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:31,360
All right.

1312
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,160
I've got a record.

1313
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,600
Did you complete the challenge for sure?

1314
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,880
I don't think we completed.

1315
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,880
Are you ready for some tunes?

1316
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,440
Yes.

1317
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:39,520
Yeah.

1318
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,080
Yeah.

1319
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,400
Yes.

1320
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:40,880
Oh.

1321
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,840
I got an achievement for that.

1322
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,880
Did it do anything?

1323
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,120
Wow.

1324
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,720
Maybe we unlocked something

1325
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,160
because it said needle drop play game.

1326
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,320
More spiders around here.

1327
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:54,880
Yeah.

1328
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,160
I'm going to smack everything.

1329
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,480
Is that blocking us?

1330
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:00,960
It is.

1331
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,280
Who?

1332
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,400
Motherfucker.

1333
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:05,680
Wake up.

1334
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,280
Where the fuck are you?

1335
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,080
Literally.

1336
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,360
We're smacking the.

1337
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,280
I said I'm becoming a spider

1338
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,560
and looking for the damn thing.

1339
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,960
Oh, oh, Mr. Spider.

1340
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,680
Where is it?

1341
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,320
Where is it?

1342
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,760
Oh, the spider is looking for you.

1343
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,640
Oh, the spider is looking for you.

1344
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,200
Someone did?

1345
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,960
Do me one.

1346
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,440
Ow.

1347
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,400
Don't spank me.

1348
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,600
When you love my lushness eight legs.

1349
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,080
I bet you want to get all up in that.

1350
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,920
Maybe we can hear it.

1351
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,680
We'll make a little nest together.

1352
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,120
Don't try to put me on the cover.

1353
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,720
And then I'll eat you afterwards.

1354
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,400
You think you can eat all of me?

1355
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,080
All still in front of me?

1356
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,240
I can find it.

1357
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:44,880
I went on the.

1358
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,080
Oh, maybe it's under the table.

1359
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:46,560
Ken, no.

1360
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,160
We still need to lay their souls to rest.

1361
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,600
Yeah, but we need one more sparkly thing.

1362
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:53,760
Right.

1363
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,760
There's none under the table as well.

1364
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,680
Where the heck is this more spider?

1365
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,760
Are you sure it's not upstairs?

1366
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,040
Because there's like a question mark.

1367
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:01,840
Oh, what happened?

1368
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:02,880
Oh, sorry.

1369
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,160
I went through the portal.

1370
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,120
Did it bring everyone?

1371
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,000
Oh, yeah.

1372
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1373
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

1374
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,600
I thought it was just really.

1375
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,440
I don't think it's okay.

1376
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,080
Okay.

1377
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,600
How do we go back there?

1378
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,880
With the recovered data chip,

1379
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,880
you can now open the portal to dimension LAMBADO.

1380
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,200
Wow, LAMBADO.

1381
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,880
LAMBADO, LAMBADO.

1382
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,600
Oh, I was like, is it LAMBADO or a dance in Spanish or something?

1383
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,880
LAMBADO, LAMBADO.

1384
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,840
I mean, I mean, I'll show you the LAMBADO.

1385
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,760
Yeah, in Portuguese, that means like a hit,

1386
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,280
like a punch, like a slap.

1387
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:39,760
LAMBADO.

1388
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,720
Oh, it's violent.

1389
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,000
Okay.

1390
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,040
Yeah, it's violent.

1391
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:45,440
Oh, no.

1392
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,560
I'm not violent.

1393
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:46,720
Okay, let's go.

1394
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,480
Do my warp spider somewhere here.

1395
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,040
We can go through the portal again.

1396
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,120
I wonder if everything's fixed or it's like so trashed.

1397
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,040
It'd be easier if it was fixed.

1398
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,120
Do our own research.

1399
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:01,680
What the fuck are we?

1400
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,440
What the fuck?

1401
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,160
Huh?

1402
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:04,480
We're giants.

1403
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,840
This is the London Mansion.

1404
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,520
We're giants?

1405
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,040
Downtown Arak Natopia.

1406
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,680
Wait, but still the dimension.

1407
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,520
I guess we have to.

1408
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,480
You don't know where you are.

1409
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:19,840
Oh, my God.

1410
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,480
It's like everything.

1411
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,280
Giant test proves are winning right now.

1412
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,880
Holy moly.

1413
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,880
Holy moly.

1414
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,440
Oh, my God.

1415
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,320
Oh, no.

1416
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,280
Things are protected.

1417
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,280
This is my canon size, by the way.

1418
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,160
Real and true, though.

1419
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:34,400
Yes.

1420
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,960
I remember when you keep that.

1421
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,400
Oh.

1422
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,440
I love killing spiders.

1423
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,600
You can destroy the buildings as well.

1424
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,560
Like, screw up, destroy them.

1425
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,440
That's so mean.

1426
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,480
I just removed the light post.

1427
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,800
I'll find it in the ocean.

1428
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,720
Nobody needs rules of transit.

1429
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,280
Take this.

1430
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,280
Wait, where'd the spinnaker?

1431
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,240
No, come back here.

1432
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,440
I saw you.

1433
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,320
Die.

1434
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,040
Is that a mine?

1435
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,920
I'm in the mine.

1436
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,800
Is there a restaurant right here?

1437
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:04,880
Is there a restaurant right here?

1438
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,840
Side to side.

1439
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:05,920
To the side.

1440
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,480
To the side.

1441
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,040
To the side.

1442
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:07,600
To the side.

1443
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,720
To the side.

1444
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,160
Someone sniped that whole air balloon.

1445
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:10,720
I ain't having it.

1446
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:10,960
You know what?

1447
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,920
I'm shooting at it.

1448
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,240
Oh.

1449
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,080
Oh, no.

1450
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,520
Oh, my God.

1451
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,200
I didn't think they were going to actually.

1452
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,160
Wait, what the heck?

1453
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,960
Why is this so funny?

1454
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,560
Strongzilla, seriously?

1455
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,280
That's so good.

1456
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,040
Oh, my God.

1457
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,720
They're in the ground.

1458
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,800
He and the sewers.

1459
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,840
They bent it.

1460
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,560
They bent it.

1461
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,080
They bent it.

1462
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:38,560
Get him.

1463
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:40,640
Oh, my God.

1464
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,360
I've done fire hydrants here in the North Anatopia.

1465
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,360
Oh, there's a pizza delivery guy.

1466
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,960
Pizza sweater.

1467
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,920
Oh, pizza dying.

1468
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1469
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,200
Hold on.

1470
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,400
I'm checking the radar.

1471
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:54,880
Oh, wait.

1472
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,240
There's this part that's open.

1473
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:56,800
Oh.

1474
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,440
What is this?

1475
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:58,960
I see you.

1476
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,520
Oh, I checked your dim.

1477
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,600
I'm so bad.

1478
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,720
I can smell you.

1479
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,280
Whoa.

1480
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,080
Hello, Juno.

1481
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:05,840
Where did it go?

1482
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,320
I love cleaning.

1483
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,920
What extension surgery?

1484
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,640
Is that what we got?

1485
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,160
Open hydrants.

1486
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,040
We got our kneecaps broken.

1487
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,480
And then how do you open hydrants?

1488
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:15,840
Oh.

1489
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,640
How is there so many scooters?

1490
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,160
You're on the bomb.

1491
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,320
How do you go from a mansion to this?

1492
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,240
I don't know.

1493
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,720
Open fire hydrant.

1494
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,720
I don't know how do you open the fire hydrants?

1495
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,120
Juno.

1496
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,480
You press E on them.

1497
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,160
You press E to open the shop.

1498
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,720
They're, like, screaming.

1499
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,920
I feel really bad.

1500
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,160
In the stop sign.

1501
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,120
Do you see the stop sign?

1502
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,000
Can you guys hear them scream?

1503
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I can hear them really bad right there.

1504
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,200
Where's the stop sign?

1505
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,160
In my hand.

1506
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,720
In my hand.

1507
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,120
This is my hand.

1508
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,880
I can't see the stop sign.

1509
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,560
It's here.

1510
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:54,960
Look.

1511
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,720
No, I can't see anything.

1512
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,480
You can't see the stop sign?

1513
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,960
I can't see the stop sign.

1514
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,760
It's right here.

1515
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,520
I'm drowning all the spiders right now.

1516
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,240
Oh, you're drowning them.

1517
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,440
You throw their cars in the water.

1518
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,400
You can become a spider.

1519
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:11,280
Oh.

1520
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:11,520
Yeah.

1521
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,200
I see one.

1522
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,760
I would shoot them up.

1523
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,840
Oh my god, you can become a spider.

1524
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,080
Not in this version.

1525
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,040
Spank them.

1526
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,680
I wish I wish I wish you could kill them as a spider.

1527
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,080
Spank them, Juno.

1528
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,760
Why is that spider taking out?

1529
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,800
What is this?

1530
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,440
It's a pizza.

1531
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,280
What's a pizza?

1532
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,920
Oh, they have little jobs in the city.

1533
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,880
Yeah.

1534
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,640
We are just ruining their lives.

1535
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,120
They're monsters.

1536
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:35,680
That's okay.

1537
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:36,880
That's okay.

1538
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,320
Journal.

1539
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,280
We got journal.

1540
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,560
We're going to hit them with journal.

1541
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,680
Oh, I need a parkour.

1542
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,640
This gives you news whenever you kill one, I think.

1543
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,240
That actually just reminded me.

1544
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,960
I remember one time my dad to kill a spider

1545
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,000
because I was too scared of it.

1546
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,200
I was like eight years old

1547
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,720
and he was too scared to do it as well.

1548
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:01,920
Really?

1549
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,320
Yeah, both of us were too scared.

1550
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,480
I was like, okay.

1551
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,080
What am I supposed to do now?

1552
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,000
Thanks, mother.

1553
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,640
Never ask again for help with the shooter.

1554
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,040
Okay.

1555
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,040
I mean, at least the spiders don't have to go to work

1556
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,000
first thing in the morning.

1557
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,520
Like, we're doing them a favor because it's not 9am yet.

1558
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,880
So really, they didn't have to do a shift and then die.

1559
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,760
They like, oh my god, it's got baker's hat on it.

1560
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,760
Oh, now I feel a little bit bad.

1561
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,160
Did they have to pay spider taxes on webs?

1562
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,120
Probably.

1563
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,160
Probably.

1564
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,440
That loaf of bread caught.

1565
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,000
Oh, no, sorry.

1566
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:38,960
That one fly.

1567
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,080
That was 50 webs.

1568
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:40,480
I'm sorry.

1569
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,040
That was a pause.

1570
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,400
I would have thought.

1571
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,440
I'm going to be right back.

1572
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:43,920
Hold on.

1573
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,120
Okay.

1574
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,560
Okay.

1575
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:18,560
What is it?

1576
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,280
Defeat tanks with the...

1577
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,200
I've not even came across a tank yet.

1578
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:23,840
Out with the old.

1579
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:24,640
Oh my god.

1580
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,240
The historic buildings.

1581
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,640
False advertising, burned billboards.

1582
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,880
Oh, yeah.

1583
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,520
What is this?

1584
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,800
Destroy spider tanks.

1585
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,440
Oh, I see.

1586
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,000
All right.

1587
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,440
I guess we've become tanks now.

1588
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,560
Oh my god, it's these spider tanks.

1589
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,680
Now they have tanks.

1590
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:44,800
No, hold on a minute.

1591
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,840
This is so funny.

1592
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,440
We're like, Avengers level threats.

1593
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,960
Why do they have tanks?

1594
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,040
Are they hurting us?

1595
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:52,880
I don't know.

1596
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:53,760
I don't think so.

1597
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,120
Yeah, we have health now.

1598
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,320
They're shooting us.

1599
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:56,880
Oh, really?

1600
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,120
Oh.

1601
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:58,960
All right, hold on.

1602
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,400
We are the real spiders.

1603
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,480
Oh, Chinese can be a little tank.

1604
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,840
I'm a tank.

1605
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,560
I'm a fight back.

1606
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,840
You did it with tanks.

1607
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,400
I'm a tank.

1608
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,680
Wait, did we do it?

1609
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,280
I'll show them a juggernaut.

1610
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,960
We can destroy the buildings.

1611
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,000
Yeah.

1612
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,840
We're more challenge complete.

1613
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,080
Oh.

1614
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,760
Wow.

1615
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:16,400
That was easy.

1616
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,440
We did it.

1617
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,160
We're so good.

1618
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,240
All right, there's another spider here.

1619
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:21,920
Oh my god.

1620
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:22,560
Do you see this?

1621
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,720
Like the spiders set you liberty?

1622
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,520
Oh, destroy it.

1623
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,080
Destroy it.

1624
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,120
That's landmark.

1625
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:27,760
Hold on.

1626
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,400
Oh.

1627
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,040
That's nice.

1628
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,600
If you don't know, I'm shooting it.

1629
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,720
I'm shooting it.

1630
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,440
No, wait.

1631
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:33,680
Right.

1632
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,840
I'm going to be a little tank.

1633
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,440
And then I'm going to throw my bullets at it.

1634
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,400
Yeah, throw it.

1635
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,120
Shooting it doesn't do anything to it.

1636
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,560
Yeah, it's not really working.

1637
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,080
Allow me.

1638
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,520
I might be small, but my tank.

1639
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,200
Oh, no, my tank is far too short.

1640
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:47,920
Hold on a minute.

1641
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,480
But come here.

1642
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,280
Come here.

1643
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,600
I mean, I'm going to see if I can get to the edge.

1644
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,800
Come on.

1645
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,440
Come on.

1646
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,280
No, that's so tiny.

1647
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,320
That's so tiny.

1648
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,360
Nice.

1649
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,200
Is it going to hit?

1650
01:02:59,200 --> 01:02:59,840
Can I aim higher?

1651
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,680
I can't see anything from up here, babe.

1652
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,800
Is it working?

1653
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,600
Aim straight up.

1654
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,520
That's like as high as I can go.

1655
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,400
Oh, shit.

1656
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,000
I literally cannot see anything.

1657
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,120
Did we get an RPG?

1658
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,000
We must get an RPG this map.

1659
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:16,400
Come on.

1660
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,800
Get me an RPG right now.

1661
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,120
I'm off the edge.

1662
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:23,200
Wait, we have to collect 30 spider hats and accessories.

1663
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,720
I don't know how to.

1664
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,280
When you kill them, if you look at the floor,

1665
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,720
there's so many like little hats.

1666
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,320
They have hats?

1667
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,080
Yeah, you can.

1668
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,680
Oh, I love robbing them.

1669
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,600
I love robbing their dead bodies.

1670
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,720
We're pillaging them.

1671
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,760
Oh, I see.

1672
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,520
That's how you get the hats.

1673
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,320
Oh, yeah.

1674
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,360
I love stealing from spiders.

1675
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,840
Did we already go on this thing?

1676
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:00,000
No, we must go because there's destroyed buildings over here.

1677
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,960
Oh, my God.

1678
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,480
OK, there's like two main islands.

1679
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:03,840
Right.

1680
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,360
I'm going to look for hats though.

1681
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,080
Their screams are so sad.

1682
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,000
It's OK.

1683
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,440
Remember what they did to us long ago?

1684
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:14,800
Exactly.

1685
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,360
What did they do?

1686
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,480
What do you think this is?

1687
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:17,600
Oh, OK.

1688
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,640
I'm not going to accidentally go through that.

1689
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,480
Does anyone have any later fluid?

1690
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:28,320
I can tell from the real that we are the real monsters.

1691
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:29,360
No.

1692
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,160
No, no, no.

1693
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,280
Why do you say that?

1694
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,440
Why do you say that?

1695
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:35,840
I don't know.

1696
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,440
You don't know?

1697
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,000
I don't know.

1698
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:38,800
This is a hunch?

1699
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,760
Maybe I'm just being self-conscious.

1700
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,640
Just a little bit.

1701
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,280
It's OK.

1702
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,280
You're not doing anything wrong.

1703
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:49,680
Yeah, you're right.

1704
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,840
Yo, dim, steal their hats.

1705
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:53,760
Big spider.

1706
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,200
We're like balloons in boats.

1707
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,400
Don't mind if I do.

1708
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,520
Oh, my God.

1709
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,800
My aim is so shit.

1710
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,000
What's with the balloons?

1711
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:02,320
Oh.

1712
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,920
Wait, you can actually shoot the balloons?

1713
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:04,240
Yeah, yeah.

1714
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,800
If you shoot the balloons, it's a part of one of the milestones.

1715
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,920
We need like four more balloons.

1716
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,520
I shot two.

1717
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,160
A boat as well.

1718
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,080
If you see a boat in the water, shoot a boat.

1719
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:21,840
A boat.

1720
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:22,160
OK.

1721
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:23,600
Yum, yum, yum.

1722
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,040
Finest cuisines.

1723
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,240
The most historic.

1724
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:28,720
Oh.

1725
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:30,880
OK.

1726
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,480
I know what the historic buildings are.

1727
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,320
Oh, the billboard.

1728
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:34,960
How does that bridge up?

1729
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,440
What a pathetic little stream here.

1730
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,080
Oh, no.

1731
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,920
Fuyo said this thickness is coming out.

1732
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:46,880
Wait, what is this?

1733
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,840
I got a burrito.

1734
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:49,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1735
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:50,960
Like, we have to destroy all the...

1736
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,960
We have to get the foods, too.

1737
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,640
The cuisine.

1738
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,280
Oh, for the billboard.

1739
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,360
Yeah, you have to, on the buildings.

1740
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:58,880
Yeah.

1741
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,200
They have food on their buildings.

1742
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:06,960
This game is like way bigger than I would ever have expected.

1743
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,480
Like, way bigger.

1744
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,280
It is really big.

1745
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:09,920
A cuisine.

1746
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,400
It's very silly.

1747
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,280
It is a nice thing to do, Fuyo.

1748
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,520
Although, I'm starting to feel a wee bit bad,

1749
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,680
but like, here's them screaming, run away.

1750
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,400
I'm like, ew.

1751
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,280
You're starting to feel a little new of hearts right now.

1752
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:25,920
Too real.

1753
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:26,720
Too real stuff.

1754
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,560
Yeah, like, I don't want to, like,

1755
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,400
start wildly attacking them.

1756
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:32,640
Oh, shit.

1757
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:33,920
There's a bunch over here.

1758
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,840
Oh, there's, like, challenges on the antenna.

1759
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:41,120
Oh, in order to say, oh, my, that's so cool.

1760
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:41,520
If you...

1761
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,560
Someone go come back next.

1762
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,080
Collect.

1763
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:44,880
If you destroy.

1764
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,360
One more.

1765
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,280
Oh, kill.

1766
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,720
We have to kill one more spider.

1767
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,720
Oh, there we go.

1768
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,960
There we go.

1769
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,360
It's so, like, when you destroy these buildings inside,

1770
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,480
there's the crystals.

1771
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,480
Oh, right.

1772
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,920
Destroy every single building.

1773
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,920
Gotta, I'm beating them up.

1774
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,240
Okay.

1775
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,400
Say no more.

1776
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:05,760
Say no more.

1777
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,760
The crystals are in there.

1778
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,080
Okay.

1779
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,160
That's cool.

1780
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:10,560
We will deal with...

1781
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,120
Are they in a particularly colored building?

1782
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:17,280
Yeah, but like, you have to finish the objectives

1783
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,320
in order to open them.

1784
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,200
Oh.

1785
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:19,760
Oh.

1786
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,080
Yeah.

1787
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:21,760
Okay.

1788
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:22,560
I see.

1789
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,680
Purple building.

1790
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:24,720
Purple buildings.

1791
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:25,280
Okay, I see.

1792
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,200
Purple building.

1793
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,960
The mollusk historic buildings.

1794
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:30,480
Okay.

1795
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,080
This was a historical building.

1796
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,160
Destroy balloons in both.

1797
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,840
Did we liberate statue one?

1798
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:38,880
I can't figure it out.

1799
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,560
Destroy it, but maybe...

1800
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,000
Maybe later.

1801
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,600
Oh, did we not destroy all the historic...

1802
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,840
Oh, no, I think this is the last historic building.

1803
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,800
Hold on.

1804
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,240
What, the Statue of Liberty?

1805
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,320
There's a...

1806
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:50,720
Did I not?

1807
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,000
Maybe a lighthouse?

1808
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,040
I saw a lighthouse earlier.

1809
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,280
Oh, look at that spinning thing over there.

1810
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:55,920
What is that?

1811
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,040
Okay, we need one more.

1812
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,320
What you see in it?

1813
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,200
And maybe...

1814
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,240
Oh, there's a purple one.

1815
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:03,520
Oh.

1816
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,920
Okay, one more historical building.

1817
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,600
The historical building's just like older

1818
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,520
than the other buildings, if that helps.

1819
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,240
There's billboards.

1820
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:10,960
Oh.

1821
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,320
Oh, there's one over here.

1822
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,120
Yeah.

1823
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:13,440
I think...

1824
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,800
They got that detailed...

1825
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,440
Where?

1826
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,560
Oh, yeah, yeah, kill it.

1827
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:17,840
I'm killing it.

1828
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:19,680
I'm killing it.

1829
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:20,160
Eat it down.

1830
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,760
I think that's it, right?

1831
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,600
There's blood here.

1832
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,240
Is it destroyed?

1833
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:26,800
I still can't open it.

1834
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:29,600
I think...

1835
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,880
Oh, I guess not.

1836
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,120
I don't have any more ammo.

1837
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:35,520
Can I shoot it?

1838
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,360
I don't know how you're supposed to...

1839
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,160
Close everything.

1840
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,520
What building is it?

1841
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,000
I love an outfit.

1842
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,040
But it looks destroyed.

1843
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:42,560
Huh.

1844
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:43,360
Oh.

1845
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:46,800
Shoot it.

1846
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,000
Oh, no, it could destroy a sister.

1847
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:48,240
Yeah.

1848
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:49,760
Yeah, I do.

1849
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,480
Thank you.

1850
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:50,960
Thank you.

1851
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,360
Thank you.

1852
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,160
Thank you.

1853
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,080
Thank you.

1854
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,480
Destroy everything.

1855
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:03,280
Wait, you have to defeat tanks in the RC tank.

1856
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,280
Is it tank time?

1857
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:07,680
Wait, would it be faster to blow up the building with tanks?

1858
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,440
Yeah, probably.

1859
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:10,240
That's what they're for.

1860
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,360
But how do we see the other tanks?

1861
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,640
Yeah, that's way faster.

1862
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:16,960
Oh, really?

1863
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,960
Wait, how do you become a tank?

1864
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,960
I'm going to destroy every small potion.

1865
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,000
You have to find the...

1866
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,640
You have to find the...

1867
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,240
In the queue, if you press Q.

1868
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,120
You can find the tank control.

1869
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,760
It's like a little cart that you control.

1870
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,600
Oh, so cute.

1871
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:36,640
Oh, look, it's another recipe.

1872
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:39,280
Wait, for the...

1873
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,560
For the witch thing?

1874
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,000
Yeah, look.

1875
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,840
Oh, my God, it all connects together.

1876
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,960
Oh, so you have to like keep going back and forth?

1877
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,240
Maybe?

1878
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,200
I guess so.

1879
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,040
I mean, the adorable orange tank.

1880
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,440
Hey, did I not see...

1881
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,480
Oh, this.

1882
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,200
There's a spider there.

1883
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,560
Rad cola.

1884
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,280
Keep smelling.

1885
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,240
There's a screenshot.

1886
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,720
Rad cola.

1887
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,720
Do we have to write that down?

1888
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,480
Do we have to write the recipe now?

1889
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,840
We have three more fighters.

1890
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:08,240
I drone.

1891
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,240
Maybe we should screenshot it.

1892
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,000
I screenshotted it.

1893
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:13,520
Organize.

1894
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:14,640
Okay.

1895
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,680
What other objectives do we have to feed?

1896
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,840
We still need to drone them.

1897
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,520
They are not making this easy.

1898
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,440
I need another...

1899
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,240
I need another balloon.

1900
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,760
I'm going to drone another one.

1901
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:28,800
How do you drone them?

1902
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,280
Throw the cars.

1903
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:35,040
They'll be attached in IOM if you use the v-scanner.

1904
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,640
And then yeet into the water.

1905
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:37,600
That's messed up.

1906
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:37,920
Okay.

1907
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,520
We need to also burn two more billboards.

1908
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,520
Oh, I see one.

1909
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,240
Billboards.

1910
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,360
Why did they make this so controversial?

1911
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,640
But this seems difficult.

1912
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,160
Like there's so many layers to...

1913
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,920
You have to watch yourself slowly become the villain.

1914
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:01,680
Yeet.

1915
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,280
You live long enough to become the villain.

1916
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,040
Oh, there's a billboard.

1917
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,000
Oh, wait.

1918
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,840
No, I think it's already destroyed.

1919
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,200
Already burned?

1920
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,080
Okay, okay, okay.

1921
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:11,920
I need...

1922
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,240
We need to drone one more bitch.

1923
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,040
Throw their cars into the ocean.

1924
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:19,360
Got it.

1925
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:19,920
I don't...

1926
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,560
I think that bridge that we can't get past this one

1927
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,160
that needs 20 freaking rocks.

1928
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:24,720
Yeah.

1929
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,680
Everything else is.

1930
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:29,760
So I don't think they go back to like another teleport.

1931
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:30,400
Basically.

1932
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:30,880
I see.

1933
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,680
That would be my guess right now

1934
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,000
because I don't have one more splitter.

1935
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,000
Oh, my God.

1936
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,160
There's billboards over there.

1937
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,240
Oh, I found one more billboard.

1938
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,360
Oh, you did?

1939
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:46,240
Yeah.

1940
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,440
I should have break every building.

1941
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,480
A historic building.

1942
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,680
Historic building.

1943
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,200
Let me see.

1944
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,600
There's any other cars here.

1945
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,120
So I can drown one.

1946
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,720
One more billboard and we unlock another like purple.

1947
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,000
Oh, I drowned one.

1948
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:09,360
Nice.

1949
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:11,600
What did you do?

1950
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,960
Okay, I opened this one.

1951
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,240
Oh, nice.

1952
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:14,400
Nice.

1953
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:14,720
Nice.

1954
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:15,200
Beat it up.

1955
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,080
Beat it up.

1956
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:16,960
Destroy it.

1957
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,320
Show his balls.

1958
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,200
Show us his balls.

1959
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,280
Vacuuming it.

1960
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,000
You're stuck.

1961
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,440
Vacuum melting.

1962
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:25,840
Yeah.

1963
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,240
Yeah, we did it.

1964
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:29,200
Right.

1965
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,960
So that's their team.

1966
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,200
So we can go back to that haunted mansion

1967
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,880
and do the bottom door on the floor.

1968
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,480
Oh, I found another billboard.

1969
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,040
Wait.

1970
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:37,600
Oh, you got it?

1971
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,320
That's the last one.

1972
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:38,880
Yeah.

1973
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:39,200
Okay.

1974
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,400
You did it.

1975
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:40,880
You did it.

1976
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:41,200
You did it.

1977
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,000
We got another one.

1978
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:43,440
Oh, my God.

1979
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,320
It's all coming together.

1980
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,440
It's all coming together now.

1981
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:45,920
Oh, my God.

1982
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,960
But we just didn't drown one more little bitch.

1983
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,240
No, no, Foo, you did it.

1984
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:50,560
She did it.

1985
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,440
I already did it.

1986
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,880
She drowned it and we got it.

1987
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:53,360
Oh.

1988
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:53,840
Yeah.

1989
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,200
Oh, we did it.

1990
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,360
Destroy another balloon thing then.

1991
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:57,680
Okay.

1992
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,000
Is this a historical building?

1993
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,880
I think it is.

1994
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:01,200
Yeah.

1995
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,320
I just see you guys.

1996
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,040
Did we destroy a historical building?

1997
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:11,920
Oh, there we go.

1998
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:12,560
There we go.

1999
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:12,960
Oh, okay.

2000
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:14,080
Okay.

2001
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:14,640
Whoa.

2002
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,040
I see it.

2003
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:15,600
No, it's not one.

2004
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:16,880
Okay.

2005
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:17,920
That's 15.

2006
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,040
How much is the bridge?

2007
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,080
20 or something?

2008
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:20,560
20.

2009
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,400
Oh, that's rough.

2010
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,560
I think we may have to go back to the witch's culture.

2011
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,920
I want to go back.

2012
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,680
Also, your body friggin...

2013
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,920
When you're hitting things with the newspaper,

2014
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,280
your body just contorts.

2015
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,960
Dude, there's no more air balloons.

2016
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:45,280
I think it must be visible behind those buildings.

2017
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:45,600
Yeah.

2018
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:47,920
Maybe we...

2019
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,880
Also, we missed the chance to defeat tanks with the tank.

2020
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:51,920
Oops.

2021
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:52,320
Yeah.

2022
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,360
Oh, I think we need like five.

2023
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,000
I think we maybe need to restart it.

2024
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,480
If Emi goes to one of the antennas to restart...

2025
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:00,960
Yeah.

2026
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,280
There might be more tanks in the next town over.

2027
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,120
What's your tunnel?

2028
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,000
The antennas is over here.

2029
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:08,640
There's one over here.

2030
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:09,360
Oh, yeah.

2031
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,880
It like starts a minigame.

2032
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:11,360
Yeah.

2033
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,480
And we can redo it.

2034
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,400
Destroy spider tanks.

2035
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:14,640
Okay.

2036
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:15,200
This is the one.

2037
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:15,760
This is the one.

2038
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,480
We're strong enough.

2039
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:16,560
Yeah.

2040
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,520
We can redo it.

2041
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,240
Oh, that one?

2042
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:19,520
Yeah.

2043
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:19,920
Okay.

2044
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,560
I'm going to turn into a tank and then we should...

2045
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,600
Get the tanks, everybody.

2046
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:23,920
Okay.

2047
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:25,600
I'm ready.

2048
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:26,800
All right.

2049
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:27,360
Wait, hold on.

2050
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,400
My tank is far away.

2051
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,080
Pond me all the way over here.

2052
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:30,880
Are they serious?

2053
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,000
Should I?

2054
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,200
Because that's where you left it.

2055
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,880
Oh.

2056
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,160
It gets left on the right.

2057
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,520
I'm very slowly coming over.

2058
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,080
Beep.

2059
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:38,480
All right.

2060
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,520
I'll come over too.

2061
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,280
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

2062
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,160
Oh, you can recall it.

2063
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:42,800
Hi, Johnny.

2064
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:43,600
You're coming in.

2065
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,560
We're coming in.

2066
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,600
They see us rolling.

2067
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,720
You can recall it.

2068
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:47,920
Oh, oh, yeah.

2069
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:49,120
Okay.

2070
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,560
That makes sense so much easier.

2071
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,320
Try to catch me red and dirty.

2072
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,400
Try to catch me red and dirty.

2073
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,280
Try to catch me red and dirty.

2074
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,120
Oh, there is a red state in there.

2075
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,240
Okay, okay.

2076
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,600
Okay, four years ahead.

2077
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,160
We're coming.

2078
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,200
And you're not red, okay.

2079
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:01,440
Okay.

2080
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:05,840
So now, once Emmy activates the mission,

2081
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,920
we'll all jump in tanks and go mental.

2082
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:08,640
Yay.

2083
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2084
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,840
Yeah, it's time to explode.

2085
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,280
I'm very slowly coming.

2086
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:16,800
Oh.

2087
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:18,400
I mean...

2088
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,920
Try to catch me red and dirty.

2089
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:22,720
All right.

2090
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:23,600
I'm not saying that.

2091
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,320
I'm not saying that.

2092
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,040
Okay, ready?

2093
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,640
Ready?

2094
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:27,200
I did it.

2095
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,000
Yes.

2096
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:28,720
Oh, it took me out.

2097
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:29,440
Where are they?

2098
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,080
Are you joking me?

2099
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,280
I took me out of the tank only to...

2100
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,240
Oh, there's the other team.

2101
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,640
Oh, why am I in the...

2102
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,280
I see them.

2103
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:35,840
I see them.

2104
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,240
Green.

2105
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:36,800
Should the green?

2106
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:37,280
Should the green?

2107
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:37,760
Green bad.

2108
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,360
I'm trying to change them.

2109
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:39,920
Green bad.

2110
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:41,520
Green bad.

2111
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:42,880
Wait, it's not even...

2112
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:43,200
Okay.

2113
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:43,760
...hitting.

2114
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:44,800
Is it registered?

2115
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,840
Is it working for you guys?

2116
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,880
Yes, but it's not a single kill.

2117
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:47,520
Very badly.

2118
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,880
It's not like a one kill hit.

2119
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,280
You have to hit multiple times.

2120
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:51,840
I'm spraying.

2121
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,160
I'm spraying.

2122
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:52,480
Okay.

2123
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,640
Okay, that's three.

2124
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,440
That's three.

2125
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,080
That's three.

2126
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:56,560
Two more.

2127
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,440
Two more.

2128
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,000
Two more.

2129
01:15:58,880 --> 01:15:59,920
Two more ladies and clean.

2130
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:00,240
Okay.

2131
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,560
My tank exploded.

2132
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:04,240
Oh, no.

2133
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,680
My team's gonna die, too.

2134
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:06,080
It's okay.

2135
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:07,440
Where are they?

2136
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:09,680
They're in the center.

2137
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,120
Oh.

2138
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,400
No, I did it.

2139
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:12,800
Let's go.

2140
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:14,560
Oh, my God.

2141
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:15,200
It's clicking.

2142
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,160
I think it's clicking.

2143
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,280
Oh, my God.

2144
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:17,920
Right.

2145
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,160
Now we can go be up a building.

2146
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,640
Whatever one it may be.

2147
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,120
See, I...

2148
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:23,520
This one?

2149
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:24,800
The pink highlight.

2150
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:24,960
Yeah.

2151
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,120
It's like a green question mark on the map.

2152
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,240
Oh, I see it.

2153
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:28,720
I see it.

2154
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:30,880
Oh, my God.

2155
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:31,520
We did it.

2156
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,040
We're balling.

2157
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,120
That's a great team.

2158
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,120
They're straight up balling.

2159
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:37,680
They're straight up extermination.

2160
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,840
We're playing worlds of cancer at least.

2161
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,960
Nice.

2162
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:45,680
Now you have 60.

2163
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,280
Early access game.

2164
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,240
This is massive.

2165
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:49,920
This is early access?

2166
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,040
Yeah.

2167
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,320
This isn't even the full release.

2168
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,440
This is like 0.6.

2169
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:53,760
What?

2170
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,280
You're not even like close to implement

2171
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,480
what you want to do.

2172
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:57,520
Huh?

2173
01:16:58,880 --> 01:16:59,840
Ooh, money.

2174
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,000
I just stole money from a spider.

2175
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,160
Oh, oh, my God.

2176
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:04,800
What a gangster.

2177
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:05,040
Oh, wait.

2178
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:05,840
No, it was Emma.

2179
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:06,960
Oh.

2180
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,200
How do you do that?

2181
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,240
That makes it slightly better.

2182
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,600
Oh, that we can shoot.

2183
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,800
I don't get it.

2184
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,920
That's what I'm saying.

2185
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:14,560
Like, I was...

2186
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,040
It's probably...

2187
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,560
Maybe there's another objective

2188
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,080
or there's another mini game too.

2189
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,920
That's just like kills spiders.

2190
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,520
Maybe some hot air balloon ones

2191
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:24,080
will appear.

2192
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:25,920
Right?

2193
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:26,560
It's over here.

2194
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,280
I think they're shooting things at us.

2195
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:29,600
What?

2196
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,000
There must be soldiers.

2197
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,520
Soldier ants.

2198
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,160
Go away.

2199
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:34,880
No, ants.

2200
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,080
Okay, no, spitters.

2201
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:37,600
Spitters.

2202
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,400
Yeah, this one's just for the soldier ones.

2203
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,960
Should I activate it?

2204
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:44,800
Yeah.

2205
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,200
Okay.

2206
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,560
Just to see what'll happen, right?

2207
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,840
Kill soldier spiders before the timer expires.

2208
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,040
Oh, this is another one.

2209
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:51,600
Right.

2210
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,080
Run, run.

2211
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,360
Get them, get them, get them, get them, get them.

2212
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,560
Hunt them down, hunt them down.

2213
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,920
Make them regret being born.

2214
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:56,960
Make them regret being born.

2215
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,160
Oh, my God.

2216
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,360
Oh, they're in tanks.

2217
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,200
They're in tanks.

2218
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,080
Oh, my God.

2219
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,640
Right, let's say everyone's getting burnt alive.

2220
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,720
I have terrible aim.

2221
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:08,720
It's over.

2222
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,400
Geneva convention's out the window.

2223
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,200
I'm on a rampage.

2224
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:13,760
All right.

2225
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:14,720
Okay, we've got seven.

2226
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:15,440
We've got seven.

2227
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:15,920
We're doing it.

2228
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:16,480
We're doing it.

2229
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,080
We're doing it.

2230
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:18,960
Come on, keep going.

2231
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:19,520
Oh, fuck.

2232
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,040
Okay, this is so satisfying.

2233
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,720
I feel like this is wrong.

2234
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,600
They're trying to run away.

2235
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,680
It's a great way to release stress.

2236
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:32,640
Challenge complete.

2237
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,840
Ray, that's another one.

2238
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,360
Let's freaking go.

2239
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:35,920
We're doing it.

2240
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:36,080
We're doing it.

2241
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:36,880
We're doing it.

2242
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,080
Yeah.

2243
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,280
Ray, I guess there's nothing we can do.

2244
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,960
I didn't unlock anything.

2245
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:43,280
Yeah.

2246
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,720
Ray, my controversial take is we need to go back

2247
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:49,920
to the witch's place now.

2248
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:51,040
More.

2249
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:52,160
I know.

2250
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,920
It was controversial.

2251
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,840
I'm sorry if we get canceled over that statement.

2252
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:57,440
It is.

2253
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,240
What it is.

2254
01:18:58,960 --> 01:18:59,680
Oh, we're going.

2255
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,240
We got to go.

2256
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:03,120
I'm ready.

2257
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:04,320
Okay.

2258
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:04,640
And her.

2259
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,040
Ready.

2260
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:06,960
Only the host.

2261
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:07,360
Oh, right.

2262
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:07,600
Okay.

2263
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,240
We're going.

2264
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,120
We're going.

2265
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:11,920
Okay.

2266
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,360
Hydration check.

2267
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,480
Hydration check.

2268
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,440
Oh, water.

2269
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,160
Drink your water.

2270
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:16,960
I don't have water.

2271
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,760
But I have a droplet device to you.

2272
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:20,160
Cheers.

2273
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:21,360
What?

2274
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:21,920
Cheers.

2275
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,520
Oh, look at all the stuff that we can go to though.

2276
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,200
Like before we do that.

2277
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,000
Yeah.

2278
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:28,080
Yeah.

2279
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:28,880
Explore the ship.

2280
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:29,680
That's so much.

2281
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,200
Okay.

2282
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,200
It's finally clicking in my head how this game

2283
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,240
mechanic works.

2284
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:34,960
I'm sorry.

2285
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,960
It took me an hour and a half.

2286
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,440
This is literally a Metroidvania game.

2287
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,760
You still work bench and army to equip.

2288
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,600
Oh, to upgrade.

2289
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,120
Hi, Darwin.

2290
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,000
You found your way in.

2291
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:52,320
Excellent.

2292
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,120
If you discover any.

2293
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,320
Yeah, you have a lot.

2294
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,240
Oh, wait.

2295
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:57,120
There is like a.

2296
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:57,440
Okay.

2297
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:58,800
Oh, well, I regret that.

2298
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,960
Oh, we can.

2299
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:01,280
Okay.

2300
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:04,240
Okay.

2301
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:07,440
Oh, upgrade.

2302
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,400
I'm always object.

2303
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:11,840
Okay.

2304
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,760
They're absolutely all over this lab.

2305
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,920
Don't be surprised when you open a like a.

2306
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:19,840
Oh, there it.

2307
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:24,480
Get it.

2308
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:24,800
Get it.

2309
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:24,880
Get it.

2310
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:24,960
Get it.

2311
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,920
Oh, my God.

2312
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:28,160
Okay.

2313
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,160
I'm close them because we destroyed them.

2314
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,200
Oh, oh, oh, shit.

2315
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,320
There's a pack of punch in this game.

2316
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,280
Like call it like literally called zombies.

2317
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,000
We've got pack a bunch.

2318
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,520
We can upgrade the extra like damaging or something.

2319
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,600
Oh, what do you guys want to upgrade?

2320
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,200
I don't know.

2321
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,000
Oh, we just got an extra.

2322
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:50,400
Okay.

2323
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,680
Oh, we can be open this now.

2324
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:52,720
Open it.

2325
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,400
Let's just give you a great points.

2326
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,000
Oh, I didn't think the locker is a thing.

2327
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,040
Nice.

2328
01:20:59,040 --> 01:20:59,840
Compound eggs.

2329
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:00,480
Let's go.

2330
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:00,960
Close it up.

2331
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,240
Okay.

2332
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,120
And then go here.

2333
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,200
I'm with the science team.

2334
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:06,960
The science team.

2335
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,200
We're going to the science team.

2336
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,040
Oh, only the host can do upgrades.

2337
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,960
Where's the upgrade?

2338
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,120
Oh, I have a laser assault.

2339
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,960
In any any dark room.

2340
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:17,920
Oh, there's a spider here.

2341
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:19,360
Where?

2342
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,200
Oh, I'll beat him.

2343
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,880
It was there was a spider.

2344
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,120
Oh, this is like the crocodile game.

2345
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,480
To create equipment from a blueprint.

2346
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,400
You grabbed like three ball things.

2347
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,760
So I don't know if you guys have that.

2348
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:32,640
Purchase here.

2349
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:32,960
Okay.

2350
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:37,760
Let's make a new weapon with the blueprint then.

2351
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:38,000
Okay.

2352
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,600
Oh, there's a spider.

2353
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,320
Teleporter.

2354
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:43,680
Create new equipment.

2355
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,720
Oh, the Molotov.

2356
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:47,200
Oh.

2357
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,600
Oh, did the Molotov.

2358
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,800
Oh, there's a Molotov.

2359
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:51,280
Okay.

2360
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,160
This shuriken.

2361
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,280
We can be nature's.

2362
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,400
Amy, we need your help.

2363
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,440
Amy, what do I do?

2364
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:04,800
Oh, we need you to press this button as a host.

2365
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,440
Which button?

2366
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,600
Over here.

2367
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,480
This is print the hollow Molotov.

2368
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,280
I did it.

2369
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,480
Yeah, we require the objective.

2370
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,280
Completed.

2371
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:16,480
Yeah.

2372
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:19,200
Okay.

2373
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,680
We need two more access to the Molotovs.

2374
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:23,520
If you press Q.

2375
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:24,640
Q.

2376
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,320
I've named Molotovs.

2377
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:27,680
What?

2378
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:28,560
Molotovs.

2379
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,520
I got six.

2380
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:32,400
Oh.

2381
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,200
Let me check these bullets.

2382
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,880
Did you also do that?

2383
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:37,440
Let me see.

2384
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,120
Molotov.

2385
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,720
Excuse me, I also burned the lab in a very unsafe way.

2386
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:45,520
Ah, spider.

2387
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,000
I'm just okay.

2388
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:50,880
Okay.

2389
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:51,760
We need one more.

2390
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:53,440
One more?

2391
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,080
Okay.

2392
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,880
Oh, yeah.

2393
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,760
Can you upgrade anything for in our armory thing?

2394
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,800
Yeah, here, here, here.

2395
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,720
Wait, I forgot where it was actually.

2396
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:04,640
Over here.

2397
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:05,760
And then we'll have 20.

2398
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2399
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,240
Here, here, here.

2400
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,960
And then we can run fast.

2401
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:13,200
Huh?

2402
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:15,440
Run fast?

2403
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,160
Use the workbench to upgrade your-

2404
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:18,960
Here, here, here.

2405
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:19,920
You can upgrade things.

2406
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:20,880
Oh, yeah.

2407
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,360
If you upgrade your quick board, we'll run fast forward.

2408
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,120
We have 20 now.

2409
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:28,800
We did it?

2410
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:29,920
Yeah, we did it.

2411
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,240
Yeah.

2412
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:30,960
Oh, my God.

2413
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,240
Wait, so we go back to the time?

2414
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,440
We have like nine upgrade points.

2415
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,120
We can upgrade basically everything.

2416
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:36,080
Yeah.

2417
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,000
So everything becomes-

2418
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,520
Eh?

2419
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,160
Who's that?

2420
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:40,880
Oh, whoa.

2421
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:42,400
Oh, my God.

2422
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,920
I just got splooged on.

2423
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:45,520
By whom?

2424
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,720
My holy duty did not to me.

2425
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,440
A spider.

2426
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,040
Ew.

2427
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,080
Sorry, it was my anchor.

2428
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,200
Go excited.

2429
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:51,840
Oh, sorry.

2430
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:52,560
It's okay.

2431
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,120
Don't worry.

2432
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,240
Hmm.

2433
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,680
Actually, if you're an eel, can you-

2434
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:58,400
No.

2435
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:58,960
Huh?

2436
01:23:58,960 --> 01:23:59,360
Maybe?

2437
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,000
What?

2438
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,840
Can you slime if you're an eel?

2439
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:02,400
No.

2440
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,880
I think those are a little slimy.

2441
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,760
I don't think people know a lot about how eel slime.

2442
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,840
Oh, wait, we can open this.

2443
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:10,880
Wait, come here.

2444
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,160
But you know, do you see the 20?

2445
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:15,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2446
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,000
Let's do it, let's do it.

2447
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:18,720
Let's do it.

2448
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:19,440
Oh, my God.

2449
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:19,920
Yeah.

2450
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:20,880
I think we can get that generator thing.

2451
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:21,440
Yeah, we can get that generator thing.

2452
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,960
Why don't we get that convenient?

2453
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,160
The command thing.

2454
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,360
I think we can take this.

2455
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:26,560
Oh, wait.

2456
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,680
Let's open this.

2457
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,840
There's already dead spiders in this area.

2458
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:30,320
I don't trust them.

2459
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,000
Kill zombie spiders.

2460
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,960
They're going to come back to life.

2461
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:35,360
They're not dead.

2462
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:37,680
Undead.

2463
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:38,560
Spongebob.

2464
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:39,280
Spongebob.

2465
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,840
Welcome to the command wing.

2466
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:42,880
There's three.

2467
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,840
There are eight zombie spiders we need to perish.

2468
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:46,400
Or nor.

2469
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:47,600
Or nor.

2470
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,000
Right here.

2471
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,200
Or nor.

2472
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,200
Where are you guys sharing numbers in chat right now?

2473
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:51,440
Wait, what?

2474
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:52,080
We are.

2475
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,680
Oh, if they die in need of each other,

2476
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,360
they've come back to life.

2477
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,960
Wait, they just keep coming over and over?

2478
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,440
Oh, sorry.

2479
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,440
If they die near each other.

2480
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:02,640
Oh.

2481
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,600
I think we take this to the, hold on.

2482
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,080
I'll go.

2483
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:06,880
I'm going to TP.

2484
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,240
Oh, there's another rich.

2485
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,720
So is all of them restarting?

2486
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:12,560
Or just?

2487
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,920
Yeah.

2488
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,120
Oh, they're dead.

2489
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,080
They're more than dead.

2490
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,280
Oh, they are back.

2491
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,560
They're like back in the whole,

2492
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,960
like in the captain's chair and everything.

2493
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:21,520
Yeah.

2494
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:22,480
You know what, nuke time.

2495
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,200
No, screw it.

2496
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:25,920
Tank time.

2497
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:26,880
We have molotovs.

2498
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:27,680
So I'm just burning everything.

2499
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,480
Oh, my God.

2500
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,400
Just burn everything now.

2501
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,280
Burn it all then.

2502
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,400
Oh, my God.

2503
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,440
There's so many.

2504
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:37,520
I don't see any.

2505
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,120
Am I blind?

2506
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,160
I don't see any either.

2507
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:41,600
I'm just hitting stuff with them.

2508
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,680
I mean, I'm hearing them getting burned.

2509
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,520
That's why I use the flamethrower a lot.

2510
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,360
Oh, it just burns them.

2511
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,160
Wait, why is that?

2512
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:49,440
Oh, there's one.

2513
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,800
What's this?

2514
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:53,680
Beat them up.

2515
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:54,720
Beat them up.

2516
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:55,520
Recess pop.

2517
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,640
Recess pop.

2518
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:57,280
Beat them up.

2519
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:57,920
Beat them up.

2520
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:58,000
Beat them up.

2521
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:58,560
Beat them up.

2522
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,040
Beat them up.

2523
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,320
Beat them up.

2524
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,120
Recess pop.

2525
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:01,440
Recess pop.

2526
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,160
Recess pop.

2527
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,840
Wait, we have a tracker.

2528
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,200
We can just find them easily.

2529
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:07,360
Hold on.

2530
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:07,760
I can hear.

2531
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,000
I would like access to it, please.

2532
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,480
Who would have killed his director

2533
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,920
if he's currently stuck in lockdown?

2534
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:14,480
Fuck you.

2535
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:16,000
How do they?

2536
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:16,480
Please.

2537
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:18,800
How do they?

2538
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,240
I can't grab the fucking tape.

2539
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:20,480
Oh.

2540
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:21,040
Where did the tape?

2541
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,040
Is the glass really in the way right now?

2542
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:25,920
I don't know if I had to.

2543
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,040
Oh.

2544
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:28,480
I think there's a way.

2545
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:29,680
You can shoot the glass.

2546
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,120
Oh, there we go.

2547
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,760
It was like burning like to a cinder,

2548
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,800
so it wasn't happening.

2549
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:35,760
Nothing screened.

2550
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:36,080
Oh.

2551
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,360
Oh, guys.

2552
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:39,760
Chest.

2553
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,040
Chest.

2554
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,400
Chest.

2555
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,040
I don't know what's in here.

2556
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:43,680
Oh, one more.

2557
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,120
Compound X.

2558
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,480
My E is the fourth.

2559
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:46,880
Chest.

2560
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,760
Yeah, this chest had a compound.

2561
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:50,000
Chest.

2562
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:51,840
I think so.

2563
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,800
We need to compound now, so.

2564
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,480
What do we do with the compound?

2565
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,320
What?

2566
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:02,640
No, it's not a compound.

2567
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:03,440
I thought it was zombies.

2568
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,320
Zombies aren't real.

2569
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,040
This is poor at a theory, though.

2570
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:14,800
Well, we go back to the teleport again to the new area,

2571
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,480
because we've unlocked so many new things

2572
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,360
like in the other area.

2573
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,480
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2574
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,360
Where's the teleport?

2575
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,240
Oh, the serotonin on my brain from unlocking things.

2576
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,680
I don't think there's anything else we can do here.

2577
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,480
Did we ever find all of the dumbbells?

2578
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:28,640
No.

2579
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:29,200
Yes, we did.

2580
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:29,440
We did.

2581
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:29,520
We did.

2582
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:29,600
We did.

2583
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,080
We did.

2584
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:30,400
We did.

2585
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:30,960
I didn't know it.

2586
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:31,280
Okay.

2587
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,840
Also, I unlocked something,

2588
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,200
so now we can shoot with this,

2589
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:36,400
but I don't understand it.

2590
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,240
I don't know where we're supposed to shoot with this.

2591
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,880
Can we shoot the whole spider planet down?

2592
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:44,080
No.

2593
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:44,800
Wait.

2594
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,040
No.

2595
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,120
Maybe eventually.

2596
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:47,440
Eventually.

2597
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:49,280
That way.

2598
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:49,600
I swear.

2599
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,040
I don't know how to do that.

2600
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,960
I opened up a teleporter over here,

2601
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,360
so you can control it from above.

2602
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:58,640
Whoa, like a bird's eye view.

2603
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,840
No, you just look at it from the screen.

2604
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:02,160
Yeah.

2605
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,600
Find a way through the reactor blast.

2606
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,120
Oh, the reactor blast door.

2607
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,640
Where's the reactor blast door?

2608
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,320
It's probably this whole thing.

2609
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,800
The red stuff, these red things right here.

2610
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:16,480
Oh.

2611
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:16,960
Oh, I know.

2612
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:20,960
The reactor doors to the right there at 3 o'clock, so maybe.

2613
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,160
Oh, can you aim there?

2614
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:24,800
Can you aim?

2615
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,320
Oh, I can see the thing turning around very slowly.

2616
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:28,640
Yeah.

2617
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:29,360
Okay, yeah.

2618
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,320
I'm aiming.

2619
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,120
I'm aiming.

2620
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,080
I'm shooting.

2621
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:32,640
Shoot it.

2622
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,600
They really couldn't have made that any slower, could they?

2623
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:36,560
No.

2624
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:38,320
It's very slow.

2625
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:38,880
It's okay.

2626
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:39,680
Patience.

2627
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,520
I feel myself aging.

2628
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,360
Oh, it is moving.

2629
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,320
I didn't even notice.

2630
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,200
Moving slowly, but surely.

2631
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:52,000
I wish we could break the window.

2632
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,400
Yeah, like, aim it at the window.

2633
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,200
Don't aim it at us, but at the window.

2634
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,640
Well, it may actually kill some spiders in the room at random.

2635
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:05,360
So that might be it.

2636
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:05,680
Yeah.

2637
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:08,240
Okay, okay.

2638
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:09,040
Just a little bit more.

2639
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,320
A little up, a little up.

2640
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:11,760
I think that's good.

2641
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:12,160
That's enough.

2642
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:13,120
Just go a little up.

2643
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:17,680
Excuse me, will the kill spider behind us?

2644
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:21,840
Is it working?

2645
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,360
I don't know what we're supposed to do.

2646
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,720
Was there an instruction?

2647
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:31,200
Should I get this?

2648
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,720
Oh, you can talk to Darwin.

2649
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:33,680
You can talk to Darwin.

2650
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:35,680
Ring the least of the reactor blast door.

2651
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,240
Some disassembly required.

2652
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,040
I just...

2653
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,800
There's no way that's supposed to be able to aim all the way over, right?

2654
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:43,680
Unless it's...

2655
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,240
I'm no convinced.

2656
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,200
I'm no curious.

2657
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:55,920
Reactor blast door.

2658
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,760
Control America's furniture.

2659
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,760
It's time to put your brain cells together.

2660
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:02,160
Come on.

2661
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:03,360
You need to...

2662
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:04,320
I don't understand.

2663
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:05,040
I don't like thinking.

2664
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,960
This sign says reactor.

2665
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,320
So maybe we should do this.

2666
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:10,480
The door?

2667
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:11,840
Yeah, that's what I was thinking,

2668
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,120
but I don't know how to aim it.

2669
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,040
I think you can.

2670
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:15,840
And then down.

2671
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:18,480
Hold on.

2672
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:18,960
I think I...

2673
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:19,520
Like that.

2674
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:21,280
It told us...

2675
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,920
It told us that Darwin said for this door,

2676
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,000
imagine little spiders and tanks.

2677
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,960
So I think we have to go back to the giant test world and destroy it.

2678
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:35,280
I don't know.

2679
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:39,200
Darwin randomly just made a reference to the wee ants and tanks.

2680
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,560
That was my one and only attempt at small talk,

2681
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,280
and then that's it.

2682
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,800
He doesn't see anything there.

2683
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:45,600
Oh.

2684
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,360
Oh, dude, I used the tube.

2685
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,280
Can you tell for me?

2686
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:50,640
No.

2687
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:51,120
What's this?

2688
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,200
Destination control.

2689
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:53,840
Ow!

2690
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:54,800
I did it!

2691
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,280
Good job!

2692
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,120
Wait, no way that worked.

2693
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:58,160
Yeah!

2694
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,000
Wait, did you have to shoot me?

2695
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,640
100.

2696
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:01,920
I had to shoot the door.

2697
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,040
No, but you shot me and then...

2698
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:05,360
Yeah.

2699
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:06,800
What is that?

2700
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,560
Oh, this knife died.

2701
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,320
Burning them in case there's a sputter in them.

2702
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:11,760
Oh, and there it is.

2703
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:11,840
Oh, and there it is.

2704
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:12,080
Yeah.

2705
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:14,080
Wow.

2706
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:15,520
What's in here?

2707
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,320
Why is this powerful?

2708
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,160
We reactivate the tailpipe.

2709
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:18,320
Oh, my God.

2710
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,200
It's like the tail room.

2711
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,440
Long way around.

2712
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,000
This room is B.

2713
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:26,000
Fuel cell.

2714
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:27,760
Oh, there's a spider here.

2715
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:28,880
A zombie spider thing.

2716
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:31,680
Oh, that's good.

2717
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:31,920
Nope.

2718
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:36,080
You don't need to locate 3 out of the 6.

2719
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,400
Fuel cells and calibrate the gate.

2720
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:41,040
This is...

2721
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:43,200
Okay, I found one.

2722
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:44,640
I found one.

2723
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,240
Oh, here's another.

2724
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,840
Oh, I lied.

2725
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,720
So one of the fuel cells is in the ventilator system

2726
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:54,720
that connects to the reactor.

2727
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:56,400
Yes.

2728
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,040
Wait, that connects the reactor to the control room.

2729
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:00,640
There's something here.

2730
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,240
I'm really bad at directions.

2731
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,000
Fuel runs into the reactor core.

2732
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,560
So ventilator system?

2733
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:11,600
What about the others?

2734
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,080
What is the fuel run?

2735
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:17,520
There is also a very large life form in that section.

2736
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,480
Is it a little quiet in class life form?

2737
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:24,080
Oh, wait.

2738
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,920
We can become a wee spider, can't we?

2739
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:26,240
Maybe.

2740
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:27,920
I think we can.

2741
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:30,640
Also, we need to put something in the reactor

2742
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:31,840
and I don't understand what it means.

2743
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:32,480
What is it?

2744
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,000
Oh, coming soon.

2745
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,120
Fuel runs.

2746
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:35,520
Yes.

2747
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:37,680
I don't know where to get them though.

2748
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:39,120
Wait, how are you coming?

2749
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,960
Only the host may perform this action.

2750
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:41,760
Begin challenge.

2751
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:42,400
Sneak through.

2752
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,840
Oh, did you try this at me?

2753
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:46,640
Or not yet?

2754
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:48,800
I can't open up.

2755
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:50,480
Oh.

2756
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:51,840
Right, sneak through the vent.

2757
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,160
Oh.

2758
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,280
Is this a boss fight?

2759
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:56,800
I don't know.

2760
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:57,440
I'm just going to cry.

2761
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:58,160
I hope not.

2762
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,160
Why do we have health?

2763
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,400
Oh.

2764
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:03,600
Get ready.

2765
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:04,720
Don't worry about it.

2766
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:05,440
Hacked.

2767
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,080
Use the tracker to detect nearby spiders.

2768
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:10,160
Oh, there's nothing here for now.

2769
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:12,400
Oh.

2770
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:14,560
Wait, what?

2771
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:15,440
Oh, wait.

2772
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:16,640
We're not going to attack them?

2773
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,240
I guess not.

2774
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:18,720
Let them pass?

2775
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,320
I guess we're just trying to sneak through.

2776
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:20,640
Yeah.

2777
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,160
Holy shit.

2778
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:22,800
I think it's my fault.

2779
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:23,360
Don't worry.

2780
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,560
I have a fire.

2781
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:25,760
Oh, abomination.

2782
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,760
Abomination, level 30.

2783
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:28,160
Okay.

2784
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:28,800
No, okay.

2785
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:30,960
Firebird, bird bird.

2786
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,360
I'm just thinking kill it.

2787
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,600
I don't want to do the old methods of hanging over me.

2788
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:38,400
Oh, god.

2789
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,200
I'm getting out of there.

2790
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,480
That thing's to be stopped.

2791
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,520
That thing's to be stopped.

2792
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,680
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2793
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:44,960
Apple it.

2794
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:45,760
Oh, my god.

2795
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:48,560
Why are we hitting it in slow motion?

2796
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:50,960
I just died.

2797
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:51,680
I died.

2798
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:53,040
I think it was worth it.

2799
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,040
I think you're faster when you're crouching.

2800
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:55,600
Let's probably get this.

2801
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:56,080
Oh, right.

2802
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:56,720
Get this.

2803
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:58,320
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

2804
01:33:59,040 --> 01:33:59,520
It's not me.

2805
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:01,840
I don't think we got it.

2806
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,120
Bro, that did not.

2807
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:05,840
That was some low level.

2808
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,280
Oh, we're up here now.

2809
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:08,480
Yeah.

2810
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:09,600
We're in the control room.

2811
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:12,160
I wanted to kill it though.

2812
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,280
We have a teleport now.

2813
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:17,040
Oh, spiders are not as cunning as they think.

2814
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,600
Scans are just many of the vindicators have stolen.

2815
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:19,920
Okay.

2816
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:21,520
We need one more.

2817
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:23,280
One more, what?

2818
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,840
Should I just not frustrated with Darwin?

2819
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,960
I'm sorry.

2820
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:31,840
It just happened.

2821
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,960
I mean, we should have a captain's quarters.

2822
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:35,680
Yeah.

2823
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:37,440
Oh, there's a morph one here as well.

2824
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,040
We find them guarded.

2825
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,640
Best of luck, bitch.

2826
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,440
Not you, but...

2827
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,600
Oh, is this another teleporting thing?

2828
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:51,760
Yes, we can come and then out of this room as much as we can.

2829
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:52,560
Please, no.

2830
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:53,840
Oh, no, this, this thing.

2831
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:54,400
What's this?

2832
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,080
The teleport.

2833
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:56,640
Bridge.

2834
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:57,520
No, but this.

2835
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,720
What I'm holding.

2836
01:34:58,720 --> 01:34:59,600
Oh, all right.

2837
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:00,240
It's like this.

2838
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,120
Wait, wait.

2839
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,080
Where are you?

2840
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,160
I put on the ground with this.

2841
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:05,440
I thought those were key codes,

2842
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:06,480
but they weren't last time.

2843
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:07,280
I think it's just the...

2844
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,000
Yeah, true.

2845
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,400
Oh, it's three.

2846
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:09,760
Okay.

2847
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:11,680
Let me double check.

2848
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:12,960
Can't we still have the other one?

2849
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,440
Maybe we should put them in the same place so we don't lose it.

2850
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:16,400
Okay.

2851
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,160
Complete vent challenges through the vindicator.

2852
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:22,400
Wait, there's more vent challenges like that?

2853
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:22,720
Three.

2854
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,320
I'm just running past.

2855
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:26,720
I'm not.

2856
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:30,160
Another compound.

2857
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:31,360
What?

2858
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,280
So we need one more cell thing.

2859
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,000
We need one more?

2860
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:39,840
Yes.

2861
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,120
I forgot where the last one is.

2862
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,000
What's his name?

2863
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:46,240
The...

2864
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:46,720
The...

2865
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:47,280
The...

2866
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:48,880
The viewers that Darwin...

2867
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,000
Darwin told us.

2868
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:51,280
Yeah.

2869
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,240
Captain's headquarters.

2870
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,840
Oh, oh, that's probably the room we spawned in.

2871
01:35:58,960 --> 01:35:59,840
Mmm.

2872
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,760
Oh, so then there should be one over there, right?

2873
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:03,120
Yeah.

2874
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:04,800
Okay.

2875
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:06,480
This is Armory.

2876
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:08,800
Wait, wasn't there one in the Armory?

2877
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:11,600
I've got a wrong one.

2878
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,240
KitKit Launcher?

2879
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,440
What the hell?

2880
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:15,600
What is it?

2881
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:16,240
Another one?

2882
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:17,360
Difficulty hard.

2883
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,400
Right.

2884
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:22,480
I think our best approach is going for it.

2885
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,560
I think our best approach is just going for it.

2886
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:28,960
I don't know if it's going to, like, help us grow.

2887
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,960
Oh, wait, it might walk across.

2888
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:31,440
Hold on.

2889
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:32,720
Or maybe.

2890
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:33,760
I don't know.

2891
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,120
No, it's not walking across.

2892
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:36,240
Right, I'm going to take a right.

2893
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:37,920
If you guys want to split up and watch out.

2894
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:38,640
Oh, shit.

2895
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:41,920
Go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right, go right.

2896
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,840
Oh, no, I'm out of freaking fluid.

2897
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:44,880
I don't have any...

2898
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:45,840
Oh, I said Molotov.

2899
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:48,560
Like, jeez, that is an epileptic seizure waiting to happen.

2900
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,040
That, like...

2901
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,000
Oh, my God.

2902
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:52,640
You did?

2903
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,080
Go, continue on.

2904
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:54,640
I'm going, I'm going.

2905
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:55,840
Continue onwards.

2906
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,360
Continue onwards.

2907
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:58,240
I've got it, I've got it, I've got it.

2908
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,480
I see it, I see it as long as the freaking spider doesn't...

2909
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,040
Let's go.

2910
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,160
Let's go.

2911
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:04,240
Okay, I've got it, I've got it, we're out.

2912
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:05,680
Oh, my God.

2913
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:06,400
Oh, where are the...

2914
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,280
It was gone from high up.

2915
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:11,120
Wow.

2916
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:12,080
Oh, wow, okay.

2917
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:14,480
We made it.

2918
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:14,880
Okay.

2919
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,440
Oh, there's a green on the map, though.

2920
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:18,320
We can open up stuff.

2921
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:18,560
Oh.

2922
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:18,880
Yeah.

2923
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,400
One more green, right?

2924
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:21,600
I'm going to put the refuel.

2925
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,560
My serotonin is through.

2926
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:25,440
Serotonin.

2927
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:27,760
Serotonin.

2928
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:29,840
Challenge.

2929
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:31,920
I got 25.

2930
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:32,400
We did it.

2931
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:33,680
We've got 25 compounds.

2932
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:34,560
I don't know what that means.

2933
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:35,360
Nice.

2934
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:36,720
That we can do, but I'll take it.

2935
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,600
This is the long teleport.

2936
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:40,320
I didn't mean that one.

2937
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:40,720
Hold on.

2938
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:42,080
This.

2939
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:44,240
How do we get inside here?

2940
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:47,520
Oh, and I'm back at the point.

2941
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:50,000
Compound X across all dimensions.

2942
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:50,880
We need 35.

2943
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:52,800
How do I get upstairs?

2944
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,760
There's something up there.

2945
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:54,800
Huh?

2946
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:56,560
There's a question mark upstairs.

2947
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:57,840
Oh, like, I'll do it up there.

2948
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,840
Oh, oh, oh, it's one over here.

2949
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:00,080
Yeah.

2950
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,080
Oh, yes.

2951
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:03,120
Okay.

2952
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:06,640
And inside the chest is another compound X.

2953
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:07,440
Probably.

2954
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:07,920
Probably.

2955
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:08,160
Yep.

2956
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:09,200
Yep.

2957
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,000
Yep.

2958
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,640
Yep.

2959
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:10,880
Right.

2960
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,400
One more.

2961
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:16,720
But there's 23 in the ship, according to, like, the top

2962
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:20,240
left compound X.

2963
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,920
Flames thrower.

2964
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:24,240
Oh.

2965
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:27,600
We're still the kill zombie spiders.

2966
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,040
We've only killed five so far.

2967
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:30,960
No, I don't know where they are.

2968
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:34,000
Keep watch of the vents.

2969
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:34,880
Wait, seriously?

2970
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:40,720
I was getting, one of the reflins said, look out for the vents.

2971
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:41,280
Do you mean to?

2972
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,320
There's a venting.

2973
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:48,320
Is that what, is that a hint to what we're supposed to do right now?

2974
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:51,360
Are we, are we, are we supposed to, are we supposed to do that?

2975
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:55,040
I wish to be sus and then wonka.

2976
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,480
Didn't I already do this one?

2977
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:02,160
Choose wisely.

2978
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,160
What is this mean?

2979
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:04,800
Oh, fuck.

2980
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:07,600
It's another vent.

2981
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:08,880
Oh, I guess you have to choose.

2982
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:11,520
Choose where to go with.

2983
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:13,760
Choose what spider to go with.

2984
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,120
What's that?

2985
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:15,920
Spiders are going to.

2986
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:16,480
Spider?

2987
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:18,960
Oh, the spider's good.

2988
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:22,800
Well, there's a baddie over there.

2989
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:24,880
I'm off.

2990
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:25,120
I'm.

2991
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,040
Okay, we can choose.

2992
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,440
We can keep going there ahead.

2993
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,080
What the?

2994
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:32,800
Wait, what?

2995
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:34,960
Huh?

2996
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:35,840
All right.

2997
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:36,400
Don't look at that.

2998
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:39,360
If you're epileptic, close your eyes because I don't know why they put that in game.

2999
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,440
Not epileptic.

3000
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,360
Wait, there's so many red.

3001
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:46,400
There's a lot of abominations around.

3002
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,600
I know where it is.

3003
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:48,720
Oh, wait, there's more than one?

3004
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:50,640
Oh, jeez.

3005
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:52,000
There's a lot.

3006
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,440
There's abomination right there.

3007
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:54,960
Wait, we're to pay one.

3008
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,880
How are we supposed to know where it is?

3009
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,240
What the fuck is this?

3010
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,400
Oh, it's following us.

3011
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:02,880
Oh, shit.

3012
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,840
I don't know how I've done it, but I found it again.

3013
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:07,520
Oh, I did?

3014
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,440
I don't know how I keep doing this, but.

3015
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:09,840
Oh, my God.

3016
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:15,840
I think I have the gamer instinct because I've got it again.

3017
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:16,160
Right.

3018
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:17,600
Oh, my God.

3019
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:22,400
Yeah, so we need two more.

3020
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:24,160
Two more?

3021
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:24,720
Two more.

3022
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:26,400
We have two.

3023
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,680
Oh, okay.

3024
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:28,400
Do we have time?

3025
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:33,920
Yeah, there should be one more from event thing and another one.

3026
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,960
Is it this one?

3027
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:35,200
Oh, no.

3028
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,080
This one's complete.

3029
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:44,720
Yeah, and so we need to do one more event and there should be one more in the overworld for us to find.

3030
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:45,520
I just don't know where.

3031
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:51,440
Is this a ventilation shaft?

3032
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,400
Maybe it's this one.

3033
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:56,800
Maybe it's this one.

3034
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:58,480
Oh, is it?

3035
01:40:58,480 --> 01:40:59,120
Is it this?

3036
01:40:59,120 --> 01:40:59,920
Oh, ring around.

3037
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,120
Well, we did do this one.

3038
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:01,440
Okay.

3039
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:03,360
This choice is complete.

3040
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:04,560
Yeah.

3041
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:09,680
What the flip?

3042
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,080
What the flip?

3043
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:14,160
Flap, Italy, duck, tick, tick, patty, walk.

3044
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:15,920
Can I find it?

3045
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:18,240
We do this.

3046
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,080
Oh, oh, we did do this one.

3047
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,680
Is it by the zombie ones?

3048
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,360
I wish there was a map in this ship.

3049
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:29,920
Oh, wait, there's a question mark.

3050
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:30,400
Hold on a minute.

3051
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:31,600
I want to ask a question more.

3052
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:32,400
Wait, what?

3053
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:36,160
I can see a green question mark in this room as if...

3054
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,760
Wait, that's one of the ventilations.

3055
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,680
We need to get in there.

3056
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:40,080
Yeah.

3057
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:44,240
Oh, are we going to have to...

3058
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:45,840
Can we go back to the mansion?

3059
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,120
I want to go back to the mansion.

3060
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:49,360
Yeah, I think that's the next step.

3061
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:52,000
Oh, go back to the mansion and then we'll call it a day.

3062
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:55,840
Mansion, mansion, mansion, wow.

3063
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,680
We need to find one more sparkly thing.

3064
01:41:58,480 --> 01:41:59,040
Oh, yeah.

3065
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,480
Wait, oh, we must put...

3066
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,120
But now we have unlocked stuff, right?

3067
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:06,320
Yeah, there'll be a low on the map rate.

3068
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,560
Uh, does Emmy have to select mansion?

3069
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:10,400
I'm coming.

3070
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:11,600
Emmy is coming.

3071
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:12,240
Yeah.

3072
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:13,600
Emmy, Emmy.

3073
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:14,240
A manor.

3074
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:19,040
Um, target dimension manor activate.

3075
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:19,440
Yes.

3076
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:20,640
Okay.

3077
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:20,960
Let's go.

3078
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:24,160
Wow.

3079
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:25,680
Wow.

3080
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:27,920
We're doing it.

3081
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:28,480
We're doing it.

3082
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:28,880
We're doing it.

3083
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:29,120
Okay.

3084
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:29,760
Great.

3085
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:30,800
Oh, is it trash?

3086
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:31,600
Is it reset?

3087
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:32,640
No, okay.

3088
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:33,280
That's fine.

3089
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:35,680
Oh, it just makes...

3090
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:37,760
That just makes finding stuff easier.

3091
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,360
Oh, but there's spiders all over again.

3092
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:44,640
Oh, my God.

3093
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:47,120
But there's so many stuff like that we can go into now.

3094
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,920
How do we lay their souls to rest?

3095
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,360
We need to find another sparkly thing.

3096
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,040
Magpie tie.

3097
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,000
Magpie tie.

3098
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,240
Okay.

3099
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:58,960
There's a really weird room under this.

3100
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,720
Oh, there's a basement.

3101
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:01,280
Yeah.

3102
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:02,000
If anyone wants...

3103
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:02,400
Oh.

3104
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:05,520
Yes.

3105
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,120
Is this how we go outside?

3106
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:08,400
Okay.

3107
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:08,880
Maybe.

3108
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:11,520
I hope there's a shiny thing in here.

3109
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,600
Oh, there's a green thing over there.

3110
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:20,080
Oh, it's here.

3111
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:20,640
What is this?

3112
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,240
You found the shiny?

3113
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,400
I found the green thing.

3114
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:25,920
Oh, what is...

3115
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:26,400
Oh, it's...

3116
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:27,840
Oh, it's on the compound.

3117
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:28,560
There's one.

3118
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:29,280
Engine on me.

3119
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,240
Yeah, more compound.

3120
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:32,640
What's in here?

3121
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:33,440
Magpie.

3122
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,000
Access the kitchen and welcome.

3123
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,040
Access the kitchen.

3124
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:42,320
Oh, that shouldn't be too hard.

3125
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:45,040
Oh, the shiny items aren't here again.

3126
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:46,240
Oh, wait, I found one.

3127
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:46,960
The basement.

3128
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:47,920
Oh, wait, they are here.

3129
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:49,360
Oh.

3130
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,480
Wait, are they back?

3131
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:53,360
Okay, found one.

3132
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:54,640
Oh, that's the newest one.

3133
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:55,760
Oh.

3134
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,200
Yeah, where's the others?

3135
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:00,480
Are they where they were supposed to be at the beginning?

3136
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,200
You can jump by a freaking spider.

3137
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,080
They're jumping me.

3138
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:04,560
God damn.

3139
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:05,280
Yes, they are.

3140
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:06,400
They are where they spawn.

3141
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:06,880
Oh.

3142
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,240
Okay, I found the iPhone phone.

3143
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,160
Okay, that way, that's so nice.

3144
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:12,080
Where was the other one?

3145
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:13,680
How do I go through this window?

3146
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,040
As a spider, maybe?

3147
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,880
Break it, or you can break it, too.

3148
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,440
Okay, another shiny one.

3149
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:22,720
We are just missing one shiny.

3150
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:25,920
It might be in the cauldron, please.

3151
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:26,880
Let me see.

3152
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,160
Yeah, I think that's the one.

3153
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:31,200
Um, I can't see it.

3154
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:37,440
But I think it was you who found that one specific shiny.

3155
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:38,240
I found these.

3156
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:40,400
I don't know where it is.

3157
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:41,840
I think it was the-

3158
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,520
Oh, the photograph?

3159
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was the photographing thing.

3160
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:48,400
I don't know where that was.

3161
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:51,360
I got so close to getting through the door.

3162
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:52,320
I mean, through the window.

3163
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:54,560
Oh, you got this.

3164
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,600
I have to wait for the cooldown.

3165
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,480
Oh, where is it?

3166
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:00,240
I don't know.

3167
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:01,840
You're the one who found the camera.

3168
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:04,960
I have no idea where it is.

3169
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:05,200
Okay.

3170
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:08,800
What is this?

3171
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:09,440
The bedroom?

3172
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:11,360
Oh, I got it out.

3173
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:13,280
I got it.

3174
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,080
It's not random.

3175
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,280
It's in the same places.

3176
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:16,400
You got the camera?

3177
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,840
No, I got the shiny.

3178
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:19,840
Look, oh, the compound X on the run.

3179
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:21,920
Is that not what I was-

3180
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,640
Oh, okay.

3181
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:25,360
Well, I accessed the balcony.

3182
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:26,960
Nice.

3183
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:29,440
Oh, God, big spider.

3184
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:31,040
What is this stuff?

3185
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:31,760
I think it was just perspective.

3186
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:32,240
Never mind.

3187
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:34,080
Okay.

3188
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,200
Why is there-

3189
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:36,880
I can hold a brew?

3190
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,320
Dude, I don't know where the-

3191
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:44,880
Can you kill the spider?

3192
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:46,960
Oh, yes.

3193
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:49,920
Burn through it.

3194
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:51,040
Hold on.

3195
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:52,000
I got really bad aim.

3196
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:52,960
Give me a second.

3197
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:53,440
Oh, shit.

3198
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:55,120
There we go.

3199
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:55,600
Okay.

3200
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:56,480
Nice.

3201
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:59,040
We only need one more painting thing.

3202
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,360
Yeah, I don't know where it is.

3203
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:03,360
Oh, I think his goes here.

3204
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:06,160
Oh.

3205
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:07,920
Yeah.

3206
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:10,720
Well, what's on the balcony?

3207
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,400
Not much.

3208
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:13,360
Jeez.

3209
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:15,360
A teapot.

3210
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:17,120
Oh.

3211
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:19,600
What's it?

3212
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:21,920
Oh, the cauldron.

3213
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:22,960
It was the cauldron?

3214
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:23,440
Okay.

3215
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:23,920
Let me see.

3216
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:24,960
I'll check all the drawers.

3217
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:26,560
What the-

3218
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,880
Oh, I thought that was like a person sitting.

3219
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:29,840
I was like, what the fuck?

3220
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,120
They're waiting for you.

3221
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:34,640
There's ghosts here.

3222
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:43,760
Okay.

3223
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:44,160
Got it.

3224
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:46,240
Where the fuck is it?

3225
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,320
Oh, I'm running out of freaking-

3226
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:49,840
Has anyone found the kitchen?

3227
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:52,080
The kitchen?

3228
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:53,360
The kitchen.

3229
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:55,120
I don't know.

3230
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:56,320
The camera is.

3231
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:02,320
Wait, I saw a camera at one point, but I don't know-

3232
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:02,560
Where?

3233
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:05,280
Yeah, I found a camera at one point,

3234
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,560
and I didn't know what to do with it,

3235
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:07,600
so I didn't touch it.

3236
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:08,160
Where is it?

3237
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:09,440
Where is it?

3238
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,160
I don't know.

3239
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:11,280
I don't remember now.

3240
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:13,680
Oh, no.

3241
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:15,440
I was going to just fight it on my face.

3242
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:17,040
Oh, come here.

3243
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:19,360
Thank you.

3244
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,160
It's still on my face.

3245
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:22,480
There we go.

3246
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:22,960
It's dead.

3247
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:24,720
I'm not kidding.

3248
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:25,840
I found the camera.

3249
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:27,840
Uh-oh.

3250
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:35,760
There's a mission and a basement for the old spooky one

3251
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:36,720
where you have to like-

3252
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:38,000
Where are you moving to?

3253
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:40,320
Just so you know.

3254
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:41,680
We'll have to do that in EJ.

3255
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:44,000
There's a big spider there.

3256
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:44,960
I don't know if I killed it.

3257
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:47,840
And you didn't see the camera in here?

3258
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:50,640
No, but also I didn't look very well.

3259
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:51,840
Oh, rich.

3260
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:55,120
Oh.

3261
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,200
The camera wasn't in there?

3262
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:03,920
I don't know where the camera was.

3263
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:04,880
My brain hurts.

3264
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,000
Let me-

3265
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:09,760
Uh, if I was a camera, where would I hide?

3266
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:21,920
You've already been in the bedroom.

3267
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:23,520
It wasn't in the witch's cauldron?

3268
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:24,960
I don't think so.

3269
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,000
Is it in the closet?

3270
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:26,240
Not.

3271
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:28,800
I might have not looked correctly.

3272
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:41,360
I mean, like the camera would be in the bathroom.

3273
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:42,480
Sus, Sus.

3274
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:44,240
Why would you put clothes in there?

3275
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,640
For fun, Chas.

3276
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:51,040
We didn't have access to the balcony either, did we?

3277
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:53,600
Yeah, but Amy opened it.

3278
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:54,320
Yeah.

3279
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:57,120
I saw the camera on a shelf.

3280
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:00,080
I might have thrown it somewhere though.

3281
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:01,520
Oh, I found the camera.

3282
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:02,960
Oh, no.

3283
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:03,520
I found it.

3284
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:04,160
I found it.

3285
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:04,560
It's okay.

3286
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:05,040
I found it.

3287
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:05,760
There we go.

3288
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:06,320
You did?

3289
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:06,960
Yeah, I did it.

3290
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:07,520
Okay, help me.

3291
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:08,080
I didn't.

3292
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:08,640
I don't know.

3293
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:09,840
I'm stuck in the basement.

3294
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:10,880
I don't know how to get out.

3295
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,160
No, I actually did it.

3296
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:16,960
29.

3297
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:18,960
Let's go.

3298
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:24,880
Okay, so there's so four more things that we can do here.

3299
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,280
So, in the basement, we need to get cans of peaches.

3300
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:31,280
I've done six, but I couldn't get the rest.

3301
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:32,000
The basement's down there.

3302
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:32,480
Oh, yeah.

3303
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:33,040
I got one more.

3304
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:33,680
Seven.

3305
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:33,920
Yeah.

3306
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:35,440
Okay.

3307
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:36,560
Right.

3308
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:39,360
Then the stairs into the ray is stuck.

3309
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:39,680
Oh.

3310
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:43,200
So, you have to find cans of peaches?

3311
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:44,000
Yeah, literally.

3312
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,120
Peaches, peaches, peaches.

3313
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:45,760
Okay.

01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:49,120
Peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches.

You know get through here

3318

And all

3319
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:05,760
If we can finish the matter, I'll happily wrap up after the matter cuz okay

3320
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:11,680
Yeah, three we have to do three we have to get three more peaches

3321
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,960
Oh

3322
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:26,080
It's okay, it's okay. I was just trying to get in here. Oh shit. I got in there, but I walked out damn it

3323
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,400
Oh wait, you didn't have to turn to this way

3324
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:35,920
How many more kinds of peaches do we need three

3325
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:40,480
Oh, I think I found one. Yeah

3326
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,040
Hit him with a okay now two more

3327
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,840
One more blue

3328
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:50,160
Or oh, and then we do the security spider game

3329
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:56,400
Okay, I hear whacking that can't tell if it's you guys or if it's like that's me

3330
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:59,600
Like the location of stuff

3331
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:01,760
No, that was me. Don't worry

3332
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:04,720
How do we get on this side? Am I done?

3333
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:07,600
How'd you guys get on that side?

3334
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:12,000
This is just like all the way around you need to do like a little 360

3335
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,880
Oh

3336
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:23,200
Is that out the window? Wait, if we can smash these windows. No, okay. I was gonna say that would be really cruel game design

3337
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:26,560
Is it dev team? We have a problem

3338
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:30,800
Where is it?

3339
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:38,960
Wait, how about we do the scary spider statue thingy? Maybe it'll reveal itself. Yeah, maybe

3340
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:41,920
Uh, I don't even know where

3341
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:46,560
What's scary you got this the aim

3342
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:50,000
One

3343
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
How you call it the weeping angels

3344
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:57,520
There's like one in the hallway somewhere. I don't know where it is, but I'll try and find it. It's over

3345
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,000
I thought it was over here. You mean you lost

3346
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:06,960
Oh, wait. No, that's all here. I'm at it. Look where strong is jumping up and down on the spot. Okay

3347
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:09,680
Oh, okay

3348
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:17,040
One of us should be looking at us basement candles while evading the spider statue, right? I'm gonna stare at the statue then

3349
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:20,880
If you guys want to blow on the

3350
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:25,840
Okay, I got one. I got one. I got two

3351
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:28,960
Whoa

3352
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:30,960
Where's the rest?

3353
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:33,600
Is there two more?

3354
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,080
Yeah

3355
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:40,880
He's not for it. I must be scarier when you're playing solo because it will be like yeah

3356
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:47,200
After you, but yeah, we're just cheating the system. I ain't blinking. Oh, here's I got another one. I ain't blinking

3357
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:53,920
How many more do we need? One more one more. I found it. I found it. Wait. I thought I did

3358
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,400
Oh, never mind

3359
01:52:56,720 --> 01:53:00,720
I did not one more. Oh, yeah, I guess I did it. This is three out of four now

3360
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,520
I think

3361
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:07,440
Don't don't put it back on if we have to say I can get the light away

3362
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:09,920
Are you putting them back on?

3363
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,320
No, no

3364
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:16,400
Oh, we have to get rid of the lights. Yeah. Yeah

3365
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:22,080
Wait, then how do you extinguish them? Do you just kind of hit them? You are the board

3366
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:26,320
Do I also turn off the lights? How do you turn off the

3367
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:30,400
Oh, no, it's just the skulls. We only have 40 seconds left

3368
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:33,360
Oh my god

3369
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:44,080
Wait, I didn't count

3370
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,320
It didn't huh

3371
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:50,720
Well, I count it. Oh, I felt you'll never guess where the last kind of pictures was where was it?

3372
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:53,120
It was made what the hell?

3373
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:57,280
Oh my god machine at the start now. So that's oh my god

3374
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:59,280
Okay

3375
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:04,560
Now we only need we only need to get uh, what is it?

3376
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:07,360
Three more of the crystals

3377
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Well, we try and finish I think so and then

3378
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:14,960
Wrap up the cheeky knit. Wait, what we don't even know what the access the kitchen and the balcony

3379
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:16,960
who's

3380
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,960
Access the kitchen. Where's the

3381
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:23,280
I'm I'm assuming the kitchen is this

3382
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:25,840
Where

3383
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,800
Right here. Yeah

3384
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:40,080
I'll go make another potion and see if it counts towards the oh, yeah. Yeah

3385
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:44,240
Let me see let me pull up my screenshot

3386
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,800
We did not didn't don't tell for

3387
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:51,120
And

3388
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:55,120
Like and I don't I don't think so. Why would they not leave that?

3389
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:58,320
Oh, no, so bring it to a simmer

3390
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,600
Okay, you have the recipe, right?

3391
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:05,760
Yes, add one femur. Okay. What?

3392
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:08,480
That wasn't me

3393
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:11,680
Is that not a fever?

3394
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:14,240
Fever a leg bone

3395
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:15,600
Yeah

3396
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:18,320
Yeah, this one

3397
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:25,040
Yeah, I put it in and explode it. I didn't like it. Well, then try it again

3398
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:31,280
Maybe it's going to do with the fire and first. Oh the bank back for hon and us. Fuck you

3399
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:34,080
No beach. Who's back?

3400
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:40,640
Okay, I need to spend any clockwise a couple of times. Okay. There we go

3401
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:45,440
What happens when we finish the femurs because we only have one more theme. Oh, no, there's another one here

3402
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:51,600
Yeah, but we'll leave us alone tricycle. We're trying to make femur in here. Put it in. Oh

3403
01:55:53,760 --> 01:56:00,000
Yeah, I don't know the femur. Do you have to put the potion here? Like yeah, is it the amount of fire? Oh

3404
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:02,800
Are you did you do two fires? Oh

3405
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:08,400
Maybe maybe I had to like break open the building more

3406
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:14,000
What do you mean break the building more is it like incomplete?

3407
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:16,800
No, like maybe

3408
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:19,440
Maybe I don't know how to explain it. Maybe I had a like

3409
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:25,040
Completely destroyed the building so that it came out or something, you know, like the fire

3410
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:29,920
Did you do the can we try to guess fire?

3411
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:33,520
I did two fires. Yeah. Oh

3412
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:40,560
That try I'm not on the trace. I'm one with the tricycle. There's four fires

3413
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,520
Oh

3414
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:47,520
No, no, no for simmer. It's just two but yeah, if I put it in explodes

3415
01:56:49,120 --> 01:56:52,400
And do we have to do simmer? Do we have to do something else?

3416
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:56,160
That is a femur. A femur is a boom. Yeah

3417
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:03,760
Yeah, this is bringing me into a simmer add one femur stir until potion takes a rosy hue add one to be a femur

3418
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:08,000
This is a femur. Where's the tibia? Maybe this is the tibia

3419
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:13,920
Yeah, this is the largest bone in the human body. So whatever one looks the biggest

3420
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:17,520
Yeah

3421
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:21,600
No, they're not the same. Look at them. They're a little different

3422
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:24,800
Okay, the weird one will be the tibia

3423
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:33,360
Wait, which one is the tibia? Where's the tibia? Okay? I don't know. I'm a smaller one few cheeky spins

3424
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:36,160
Then you worry, I'll keep you straight when it comes to biology

3425
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,800
Okay

3426
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,800
Okay, I ready

3427
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,320
What they look the same

3428
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:44,000
No, no, no

3429
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,600
Look at the femur. Yeah, that one the one that foo use hold and look at the hip

3430
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:54,240
That's the hip on the top of the femur. Yeah, right two two two fires in the summer before you put it in

3431
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:56,160
Okay

3432
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:58,000
femur

3433
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,840
No

3434
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:01,040
I don't

3435
01:58:01,120 --> 01:58:04,960
I'm why have I did not register that? I don't understand. I don't know

3436
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:12,640
Simmers fires. Is there any fire mentioned on your screenshot or is it literally like? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's just bring cauldron to a simmer

3437
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:14,720
it's too

3438
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:17,440
Yeah, I think I had a break open the building completely

3439
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:22,400
Yeah

3440
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:24,400
Yeah, two fires is a simmer

3441
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,680
Then do we have to leave the two fires for a little bit?

3442
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:30,640
No, I don't think so

3443
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:35,280
I think the game's being annoying. Hold on. We never came out into the circle

3444
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:39,760
How do we open the

3445
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:45,200
Oh, sorry, I didn't call it wise I didn't call it wise. It's okay

3446
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:49,920
I guess I I think I did have to like break open the building more

3447
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:55,520
Do you want to go back or well? No, I was gonna say are we wrapping it up?

3448
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:58,240
We're wrapping it up

3449
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:01,120
Okay, what's the thing?

3450
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:05,600
I mean, I'm pretty satisfied with how much progress we made because I was playing for how

3451
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:08,960
Like seeing that game go all the phone went in

3452
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:11,760
No way it works this time

3453
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:15,120
Is it because for you something

3454
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:17,680
I understand for you

3455
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:21,600
You're

3456
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:25,200
That'll be the look of years making it

3457
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:30,800
A spider on your face. It's okay. I would whack but I don't want to break the cauldron. I'm just gonna

3458
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:33,840
Well, there you go. Hold on. Hold on. It's still there

3459
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:38,080
I don't know. I killed it mixing the magic potion

3460
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,880
Dude

3461
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:48,960
I have no idea where that's not working. I think it might have worked because you let it simmer for a little bit

3462
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:54,240
Really should have thought about that before having impatient players

3463
01:59:55,600 --> 02:00:00,480
I can't believe it doesn't instantly work right away after we followed the instructions

3464
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:10,800
Well, thank you for inviting us. It was really really fun. Thank you for coming. I was well good. I didn't expect I honestly like

3465
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:17,360
Didn't expect it because it he did the tiny things but thank you so much for entertaining us as well

3466
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:19,440
Like this is a hit in the hauler

3467
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:22,640
I kind of want to play this again. This is really fun

3468
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:24,880
Yeah

3469
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:30,080
I think if we made progress faster it maybe would have dragged a wee bit less

3470
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:32,480
But I think now that we understand the core element

3471
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:36,000
Yeah, I understand. I already get the core element now

3472
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:41,920
Yeah, but thank you so much for seeing us. Thank you for inviting us

3473
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:43,920
Thank you. Do you guys have any announcements?

3474
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:47,360
No, thanks. No

3475
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:49,360
No? No announcements?

3476
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:50,480
What do you mean?

3477
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:54,560
Do you have an what would you want an announcement? Hold on you go first. No

3478
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:59,520
No, no, no, no, I was just thinking if there's anything like fun that's gonna happen soon for you guys

3479
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:04,160
Oh, I can't leak a secret. Yeah, I'm not allowed to leak it. I'm unfortunately

3480
02:01:09,600 --> 02:01:11,600
Oh gosh

3481
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:16,240
I didn't know no, there's no secrets that's not been announced. There's no secret

3482
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:22,480
I totally didn't leak it to jenna before we started but no no secrets at all. Nope

3483
02:01:24,160 --> 02:01:26,160
Okay, okay

3484
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:44,480
Um, I'll leave the game I guess

3485
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,400
Um

3486
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:57,040
Everyone's still on my screen too

3487
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:02,080
Um here, um, I didn't see everyone still talking

3488
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:06,000
Quick collab. There we go. Kick them all out

3489
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:09,200
Um

3490
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:15,600
I'm so so sorry for my mic. I don't know why it's broken

3491
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:18,320
I'm sorry if I was being quiet

3492
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:19,840
um

3493
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:21,680
like

3494
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:26,720
A little bit less than halfway through the collab. I suddenly felt really sick again like yesterday

3495
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:30,000
So I was just being a little quiet

3496
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:32,880
um

3497
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:36,480
Because if I talk I'm gonna puke so

3498
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:42,800
I will leave you here. Um, thank you for watching the collab

3499
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:45,680
I'll see you. Um

3500
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:51,360
Maybe tomorrow, um, okay

3501
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:56,640
Thank you. Have a have a good rest of your day

3502
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:00,960
