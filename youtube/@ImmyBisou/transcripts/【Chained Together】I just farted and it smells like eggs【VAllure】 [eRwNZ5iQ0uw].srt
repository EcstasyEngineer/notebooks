1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,820
Music

2
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:53,580
and

3
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:17,100
Hi!

4
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,540
Wait, what do you mean, you know, I need to show you guys the eating big butts.

5
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,620
Yeah, like, we were discussing before Stream started that guinea pigs don't have tails,

6
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,620
and I'm like, nah, you're lying.

7
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,620
No, they don't have tails!

8
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,620
Oh my god, they do have butt cramps!

9
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,620
What is this?

10
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,620
What is this?

11
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,620
Wait, are you serious?

12
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,620
Is this real?

13
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,620
Is this a photoshopped?

14
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,620
Is this photoshopped?

15
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,620
Why is it like concave?

16
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,620
It looks like those frogs with butts.

17
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:48,620
Do you know what I'm talking about?

18
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:54,620
It's, um, I believe it's called a grease gland.

19
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,620
I don't like a grease gland.

20
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,620
That's where all the grease is made.

21
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,620
That just doesn't look real to me.

22
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,620
It's like my brain doesn't accept that.

23
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,620
I know, same.

24
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,620
I'm just like, where's the tail?

25
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,620
Is that your guinea pig?

26
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,620
No, I do own guinea pigs, but that's why I knew they don't have tails.

27
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,620
Oh, okay.

28
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,620
I know this is your butt, though.

29
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,620
It's my butt.

30
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,620
Oh my god, look at the little feet.

31
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,620
They have little rat peats.

32
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,620
They are very rat-like.

33
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,620
Oh my god.

34
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,620
I'm allergic to guinea pigs and rodents.

35
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,620
You should be honestly fine with guinea pigs.

36
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,620
I think guinea pigs are pretty good with people who have allergies.

37
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,620
No, I'm allergic to rabbits and I'm allergic to guinea pigs.

38
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,620
Don't ask me why I'm a rabbit and I'm allergic to rabbits.

39
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,620
This is how things are.

40
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,620
Can I ask you why you're allergic to guinea pigs?

41
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,620
Because my friend had a guinea pig.

42
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,620
And I would always get itchy and like, sneeze-y.

43
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,620
That's crazy.

44
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,620
Guinea pigs are like one of the harder animals to be allergic to.

45
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,620
I guess I win that that.

46
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:10,620
I'm allergic to animals that I wish I could love, but I can't because they make me sneeze.

47
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,620
Honestly.

48
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,620
That's such a shame.

49
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,620
You can't even love yourself.

50
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,620
I know, I can't.

51
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,620
Last time I hung out with a bunny, I almost went into anaphylactic shock.

52
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,620
Oh.

53
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,620
No.

54
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,620
It was again a travesty.

55
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,620
You know, I have a friend with seven cats.

56
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,620
And my roommates like heavily alert cats.

57
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:44,620
So we go over and even with like air purifiers and it cleaned the place regularly,

58
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,620
it like he dies after like an hour.

59
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,620
Oh no.

60
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,620
Natural selection.

61
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,620
Maybe he's going to kill me.

62
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,620
I'm sorry.

63
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,620
We have to make room for the strong and then she just cuts my head off or something.

64
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,620
I don't know.

65
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,620
She just sticks her out.

66
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,620
I don't know if I'm allergic to rats or mice.

67
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,620
I don't know.

68
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,620
They're not, they're not particularly fluffy creatures.

69
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,620
Are they hard or something?

70
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,620
It's like the spit.

71
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,620
No, but they're soft.

72
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,620
Rats are really soft.

73
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,620
I had a friend who brought them to school.

74
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,620
You touched a rat?

75
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,620
What do you want to say?

76
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,620
Go ahead.

77
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,620
I'm going to say, I'm going to hold my tongue on this one.

78
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,620
Why?

79
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,620
I'm going to hold my tongue on this one.

80
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,620
No, no, go ahead.

81
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,620
Say it.

82
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,620
Go ahead.

83
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,620
Say it.

84
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,620
No, because I know you're going to bully me later.

85
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,620
No, no, no.

86
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,620
You mean my bully you though?

87
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,620
You mean my bully you?

88
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,620
Say it.

89
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,620
I'm not going to say it.

90
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,620
I mean, don't you own rats?

91
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,620
I do.

92
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,620
Yeah, yeah.

93
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,620
Say it.

94
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,620
No, I'm not trying to get beat up.

95
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,620
I'm not trying to get beat up here.

96
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,620
Self preservation.

97
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,620
She will survive me.

98
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,620
Not so much.

99
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,620
Rats are awesome.

100
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,620
It's like that, it's like that scene from Ben 10 with Kevin.

101
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,620
He's like, you got to treat a woman like you treat your car.

102
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,620
And this girlfriend's like, yeah, go on.

103
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,620
And he's like, no.

104
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:21,620
It's the way you bring up the scene every time I talk to you.

105
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,620
You know, it's crazy.

106
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,620
Oh, I think it was like, honestly, seven year old me, whatever,

107
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,620
whatever they had, they came out with like teen Ben 10.

108
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,620
I thought Kevin was so hot.

109
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,620
Because he was.

110
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,620
You're not wrong.

111
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,620
Kevin who?

112
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,620
Who?

113
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,620
Mr. Kevin.

114
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,620
Let me use the ultimate zoomer.

115
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,620
Kevin 11.

116
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,620
Wait.

117
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,620
Kevin 11.

118
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,620
Kevin 11.

119
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,620
I think it's Kevin 11.

120
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,620
Yeah.

121
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,620
Kevin 11.

122
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,620
Kevin 11.

123
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,620
He has like a car.

124
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,620
Yeah.

125
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,620
No, no, no, no.

126
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,620
Okay, okay.

127
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,620
There's like an ugly version of him now.

128
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,620
Wait, I want to see, how did this age, because I haven't seen the show yet.

129
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,620
No, no, okay.

130
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,620
Wait, yeah.

131
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,620
So there's like, there's an ugly one where it kind of looks like a stoner.

132
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,620
And he does not look good, but like.

133
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,620
Yeah.

134
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,620
But there's like.

135
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,620
Oh yeah.

136
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,620
No, not him.

137
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,620
No.

138
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,620
I feel like we're being.

139
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,620
It was a different version.

140
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,620
No, I think I see the version you mean.

141
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,620
Yeah.

142
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,620
Okay.

143
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,620
There we go.

144
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,620
The black t-shirt and the gray.

145
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,620
Yeah.

146
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,620
That's the one.

147
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,620
Okay.

148
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,620
That's the hotline.

149
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,620
Okay.

150
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,620
Okay.

151
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,620
I see what you mean.

152
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,620
You're judging us.

153
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,620
I was really judging you for the first picture I saw.

154
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,620
I was like.

155
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,620
Because he was fine back in the day.

156
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,620
Oh, it was like the alien.

157
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,620
No, no, no, no, no.

158
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,620
Maybe, maybe you live like alien.

159
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,620
Yeah.

160
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,620
Four arms is hot.

161
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,620
Okay.

162
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,620
Maybe we should start the game.

163
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,620
Or we should introduce ourselves.

164
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,620
Oh yeah.

165
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,620
Yeah.

166
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,620
Oh, I just think everyone knew, but that's my bad.

167
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,620
Not everyone knows.

168
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
It's okay.

169
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,620
We can, we can.

170
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,620
Because the only people that matter are the four people in this call and we love each other.

171
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,620
That's right.

172
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,620
Maybe.

173
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,620
Someone asked, are these the friends?

174
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,620
What's wrong with that?

175
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,620
What do you mean are these the friends?

176
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,620
Of course they're my friends.

177
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,620
The two friends you have, the three.

178
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,620
You not count, right?

179
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,620
Did you, did you, did you say to myself?

180
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,620
Yeah.

181
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,620
Because we're really.

182
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,620
Oh.

183
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,620
She's more than a friend.

184
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,620
She's my wife.

185
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,620
Your twin flame.

186
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,620
We could have been roommates.

187
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,620
Do you guys think, so what is a twin flame?

188
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,620
Is that like a soulmate?

189
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,620
It's a cult.

190
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,620
What?

191
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,620
No.

192
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,620
It's a cult.

193
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,620
Really?

194
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,620
No, no, no.

195
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,620
That's something else in me.

196
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,620
No.

197
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:51,620
A twin flame is usually someone that you're meant to have a relationship and within a

198
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,620
karmic cycle and it's very hot and burning and it can actually be pretty toxic, but

199
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,620
very passionate and loving at the same time.

200
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,620
Oh, so me and Viv.

201
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,620
It's like a shitty soulmate.

202
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,620
A shitty soulmate.

203
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,620
Yeah, that's us.

204
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,620
I beat her in game pigeon and then I laugh at her.

205
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,620
I hate her so much.

206
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,620
I hate her so much.

207
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,620
Okay, to be fair, I was going to go easy on her and then she said, you're going down.

208
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,620
Oh.

209
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,620
I thought you would like that.

210
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,620
I thought that would make it hotter for you.

211
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,620
So we played eight ball and she made fun of me for a bad play and then she immediately

212
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,620
hit the eight ball into the hole and she lost in the first round.

213
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,620
I didn't know how eight ball works.

214
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,620
I didn't know like you literally couldn't touch the eight ball.

215
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,620
I didn't know.

216
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,620
It was unlucky for me.

217
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,620
We should probably introduce ourselves.

218
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,620
Sorry, I'm reading my chat because they're like, wait, isn't that like in the, like a

219
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,620
Will Smith movie in Hancock?

220
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,620
And I totally forgot that that is part of that movie.

221
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,620
What is it?

222
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,620
The Twin Flames something or other.

223
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,620
But it is a cult.

224
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,620
Yeah.

225
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,620
I only know the cult one.

226
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,620
It's all you need to know.

227
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,620
Okay.

228
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,620
Hi, hi, hi everyone.

229
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,620
Hi chat.

230
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,620
Um, I'm, I'm Emmy.

231
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,620
I'm from Vealer.

232
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,620
Uh, yeah.

233
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,620
Uh, yeah.

234
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,620
Nice to meet you.

235
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,620
Yeah.

236
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,620
That's fair.

237
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,620
Who wants to go next?

238
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,620
If no one raises their hand, I'm going to choose.

239
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,620
Okay.

240
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,620
All in told.

241
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,620
Um, hi.

242
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,620
Hello there.

243
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,620
My name is Sheebie Cottonbum of Gen 1 Vealers Indulge.

244
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,620
And I'm your favorite dorky girl failure, Dom failure.

245
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,620
What?

246
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,620
She already fucked it up.

247
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,620
Yeah.

248
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,620
Good job, Sheebie.

249
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,620
I tried my best.

250
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,620
Viv, do you want to go first?

251
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,620
You want me?

252
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,620
Yeah.

253
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,620
Okay.

254
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,620
I guess I'll go.

255
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,620
Hi.

256
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,620
I'm Vivian Voss, your neighborhood biker babe.

257
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,620
Nice to meet you.

258
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,620
You're a biker.

259
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,620
Yeah.

260
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,620
Like, like a tricycle?

261
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,620
She doesn't even know what to say.

262
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,620
She just stared at the camera like, what the fuck did you just say?

263
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,620
I need to take a really big breath after that one.

264
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,620
I was, I have anger management issues.

265
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,620
Baby girl.

266
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,620
She was having like flashbacks to something else.

267
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:40,620
I wanted to know it's a unicycle.

268
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,620
Okay.

269
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,620
She's the only human.

270
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,620
Wait, actually no, Amy's human.

271
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,620
I'm human.

272
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,620
Are you human?

273
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,620
I thought you were like a, what was it called?

274
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,620
A gamer.

275
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,620
I hate you.

276
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,620
I have a different race.

277
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,620
I'm a gamer.

278
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,620
I mean, look at that dick.

279
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:06,620
You guys didn't know this, but we were in call and we were talking about something completely

280
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,620
different.

281
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,620
And then I just went, why do you have a dent in your head?

282
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,620
And I never noticed him.

283
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,620
He has a lovely cute dent in her head.

284
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,620
I can rest my booba in it.

285
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,620
Maybe that's why it's dented.

286
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,620
Cause it's only dented on her.

287
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,620
I actually kind of want that as a photo.

288
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,620
Me just like picking her up and tucking her under my breast.

289
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:31,620
This is holding her closely to my bosom.

290
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,620
Okay.

291
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,620
I was like that too.

292
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,620
All right.

293
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,620
So am I the only one who's played this before?

294
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,620
I haven't done my intro.

295
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,620
Oh, I'm leaving.

296
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,620
I'm just going to be down here.

297
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,620
I'm just proud to also not a softy.

298
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,620
I'm a guinea pig.

299
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,620
I have a nice butt apparently.

300
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,620
That's it.

301
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,620
We didn't say nice.

302
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,620
I know.

303
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,620
I have a nice butt.

304
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,620
Confounding.

305
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,620
I mean, it's a butt.

306
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,620
All right.

307
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,620
Something.

308
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,620
Okay.

309
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,620
I don't have a tail.

310
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,620
I mean, your butt hangs kind of low.

311
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,620
You got a long back or something like that.

312
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:20,620
Oh, are you talking about, are you talking about like her guinea pig butt?

313
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,620
Oh, okay.

314
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,620
She's just mad.

315
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,620
I said she rides a bicycle.

316
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,620
A tricycle.

317
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,620
Oh, a tricycle.

318
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,620
Yeah.

319
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,620
I really hate me.

320
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,620
Okay.

321
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,620
We should start this game before she kills me.

322
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,620
Okay.

323
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,620
I'm starting it.

324
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,620
Has anybody played the game?

325
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,620
I'm in the back.

326
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,620
Oh, hold on.

327
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,620
We have played before.

328
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,620
We have played before.

329
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,620
Viv is going to kill us.

330
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,620
Wait, who's in the middle?

331
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,620
Okay.

332
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,620
So we got Emmy and Sopralto on the ends.

333
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,620
Very interesting.

334
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,620
Uh-oh.

335
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,620
Emmy.

336
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,620
Emmy, what?

337
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,620
No, you might.

338
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,620
I actually think I trust you more than Sopralto.

339
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,620
What?

340
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,620
I'll have you know.

341
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,620
I am broke even though you've never played before.

342
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,620
Is the end like an important task?

343
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,620
See, the gods are mad at you for that.

344
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,620
There's no god here.

345
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,620
I can pull people?

346
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,620
Oh, I can pull you guys in.

347
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,620
Oh, shit.

348
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,620
I can pull you in.

349
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,620
Oh, pull me in.

350
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,620
I forget how to pull.

351
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,620
How do I pull?

352
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,620
It's easy.

353
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,620
And you look at them.

354
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,620
Are we both an old man?

355
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,620
Yeah.

356
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,620
We're both an old white man.

357
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,620
I specifically chose the old man.

358
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,620
I don't know.

359
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,620
He's pretty spry for being an old guy.

360
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,620
Pretty fly for an old guy.

361
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,620
We have our toes out, too.

362
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,620
We do.

363
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,620
We are barefoot.

364
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,620
What the heck?

365
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,620
No, no, no.

366
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,620
Don't let them look.

367
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,620
Don't let them look.

368
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,620
That's charge premium.

369
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,620
Okay, cover it with the chains at all times.

370
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,620
It's not too hard so far.

371
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,620
Oh, walking.

372
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,620
So what we said about not trusting me?

373
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,620
Don't do it.

374
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,620
Don't do it.

375
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,620
Don't do it.

376
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,620
Don't do it.

377
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,620
Don't do it.

378
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,620
Don't do it.

379
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,620
Don't do it.

380
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,620
Don't do it.

381
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,620
Don't do it.

382
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,620
Don't do it.

383
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,620
You guys can't see.

384
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,620
See what?

385
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,620
See what?

386
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,620
See he's not in your mouth.

387
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,620
Oh my god.

388
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,620
You can't see my game.

389
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,620
How can you not see my game?

390
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,620
Pull me.

391
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,620
You pull me.

392
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,620
I'm pulling you.

393
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,620
Don't worry.

394
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,620
Okay.

395
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:52,440
It's all in the character selection screen for everyone.

396
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,940
How is that happening?

397
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,840
Did you do capture or were you sure in game capture?

398
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,340
You should do game capture.

399
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,340
Okay.

400
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,340
Okay.

401
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,340
Now it's working.

402
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,340
Now it's working.

403
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,500
I don't know why it did that.

404
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,780
There you go.

405
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,780
Time to lock in.

406
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,780
Time to lock in.

407
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,580
Is this in difficult mode or do we have technologies?

408
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,100
I put normal mode from what I remember.

409
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,100
Ah!

410
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,100
Okay.

411
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,100
Okay.

412
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,100
Okay.

413
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100
Do you want to have countdown?

414
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,100
Do you want to have countdown?

415
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
No.

416
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,100
We're brought down.

417
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,100
Countdown?

418
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,100
No.

419
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,100
We don't do countdowns around here.

420
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
Okay.

421
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
We just go for it.

422
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,100
Mine.

423
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Mine.

424
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,100
Okay.

425
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,100
You know what we kind of look like?

426
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,100
We look like Grunko Stan, Ford, Mabel, and Wendy.

427
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,100
What a redhead.

428
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,100
Oh, you're wrong.

429
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,100
What is that?

430
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,100
Yeah, what is this?

431
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,100
It's from Gravity Falls.

432
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,100
All right.

433
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,100
We'll go in order.

434
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,100
Uh, or not.

435
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,100
It's fine.

436
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,100
We've gotten this far.

437
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
I'm just waiting for one of us to fall off.

438
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,100
What is that?

439
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,100
You want me to fall off?

440
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

441
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,100
Did you just say fall off?

442
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,100
Well, if you do, we can pull you back up, I guess.

443
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100
Is that a bet?

444
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
No, I would.

445
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,100
I would do it.

446
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
Do it.

447
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,100
Throw yourself off.

448
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Do it.

449
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Don't do it, please.

450
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,100
You have to get it.

451
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,100
Pull it up.

452
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,100
I can't.

453
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
I can't.

454
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,100
I can't.

455
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
You're too heavy.

456
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,100
Grab.

457
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,100
You got to grab.

458
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,100
Grab.

459
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,100
Oh, sorry.

460
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,100
I can't.

461
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,100
I can't.

462
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,100
I can't.

463
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,100
I can't.

464
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,100
I can't.

465
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,100
I can't.

466
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,100
I can't.

467
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
I can't.

468
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
I can't.

469
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,100
I can't.

470
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,100
I can't.

471
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,100
Wait.

472
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,100
No.

473
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,100
Pam.

474
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,100
No!

475
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,100
Wait.

476
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,100
No!

477
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,100
No!

478
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,100
I can't.

479
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,100
I can't.

480
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,100
I can't.

481
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,100
I'll just follow you.

482
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,100
I don't believe it.

483
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,100
I'll just follow you.

484
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,100
It's hard.

485
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,100
It's hard.

486
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:43,120
The

487
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:52,020
thing is that I think we can, in this case , leave us there.

488
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,500
How did she manage to be a good gamer?

489
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,820
I think we should leave surprise up now, okay?

490
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,100
We should cut her off at the end.

491
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,940
Wait, we're twins, so you can't leave me.

492
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,540
I should have eaten you in the womb.

493
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,620
Don't fall off in the fall.

494
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,580
Was that fall off?

495
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,140
Oh my god.

496
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,260
Do you have selective hearing?

497
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,460
I'm maybe.

498
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,140
I mean, I am an old guy.

499
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,620
You got to adjust your hearing aid, brother.

500
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,260
All right, so don't touch me.

501
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,260
Oh, no, no, no.

502
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,260
No, no, no.

503
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,700
Oh, awesome.

504
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,740
OK, I'm sorry.

505
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,700
I'm sorry.

506
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,420
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

507
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,340
I'm not going to be pulling salt in you.

508
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,180
I'm going to fall if I turn around.

509
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,500
No, OK, just bolt this back up, back up.

510
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,340
You see that thingy?

511
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,180
What thingy?

512
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,060
The little stick.

513
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,860
Why don't you jump on the other side of the stick,

514
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,260
and then we can, like, jump on the other side of the stick.

515
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,860
Or you can back up on the rock.

516
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,820
I can't jump.

517
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,660
And then press E. OK.

518
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,540
Someone's going to write.

519
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,700
The stream is just too bad.

520
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,740
I'm going to do it first.

521
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,540
OK, there we go.

522
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,420
Can you guys?

523
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,020
Can you come up from here or no?

524
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,980
Can you pull me?

525
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,460
Can I want for you?

526
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,340
Can I want for you?

527
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,540
Can you come up here for me?

528
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,540
I'm scared.

529
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,660
OK, I'll come in for you.

530
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,300
OK.

531
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,260
Help me, please.

532
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,380
Oh, OK, we did it.

533
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,660
That wasn't too bad.

534
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,300
I can't wait.

535
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,740
We've only gotten this far.

536
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,620
You guys are stupid.

537
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,980
I'm not even at, like, the crazy part yet.

538
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,740
This isn't the crazy part.

539
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,620
Wait, what are you waiting?

540
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,420
This isn't the hardest part.

541
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,380
No, this isn't the hardest part.

542
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,060
Tell me, we haven't even gotten past the tutorial.

543
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,420
No, this is literally still a tutorial.

544
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,220
This is a tutorial?

545
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,660
Essentially.

546
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,300
OK, what?

547
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,420
This kind of gives you a taste of everything.

548
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,060
OK, ready?

549
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,380
So don't touch these.

550
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,020
We have to jump over them.

551
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,540
Can the chain touch it?

552
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,380
Yes, that's fine.

553
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,420
OK.

554
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,580
You can also run.

555
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,060
Don't get hit by that.

556
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,940
Thanks.

557
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,100
And then you can Mario climb the fence.

558
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,580
What does that mean?

559
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,460
Mario climb the fence.

560
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,700
You'll see what I mean.

561
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,220
We've literally played this game before.

562
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,300
What do you mean?

563
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,700
Mario climb the fence.

564
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,980
Someone said we're just two pairs of the same person.

565
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,940
They're kind of right.

566
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,700
You're not wrong, actually.

567
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,220
I was thinking that earlier.

568
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,060
I didn't want to show, but I didn't want to say it.

569
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,620
How do I get off?

570
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,700
Just press B.

571
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,460
All right, OK, so there's a trampoline.

572
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,580
So we're just going to 1, 2, 3.

573
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,260
Yippee-doo.

574
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,260
Oh, what just happened?

575
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,100
All right, no, get off.

576
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,660
Get off of it.

577
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,660
OK, OK, OK, we're all going to get it, right?

578
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,300
Aim towards the other one.

579
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:41,900
There you go.

580
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,580
OK, OK.

581
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,580
Yippee.

582
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,580
Yippee.

583
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,620
OK, OK, OK.

584
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,100
Nice.

585
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,180
I know, go, go, go.

586
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,180
Keep going, make it, make it.

587
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,180
Nice.

588
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,180
Don't worry, Amy, we got you.

589
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,020
I'm stressing.

590
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,020
OK.

591
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,020
Now let's go through the climb.

592
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,020
Now we're going the hole.

593
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,520
The hole.

594
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,020
The love.

595
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,220
The love climb the hole.

596
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,820
I love you, baby girl.

597
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,820
I love you too.

598
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,820
Yeah, pookie.

599
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,820
Pookie?

600
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,300
Pookie bear.

601
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,300
No, that's only for me, babe.

602
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,300
That's only for me.

603
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,300
That's only for me.

604
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,500
Earth?

605
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,620
OK, I know for a fact we're going to fall off this time.

606
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,220
No, no, no, no, no, no, I got this.

607
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,820
I got this.

608
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,620
OK, you go first.

609
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,300
You go first.

610
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,180
You go first.

611
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,060
I don't trust her.

612
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,820
Don't do it.

613
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,700
You're making me nervous.

614
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,340
OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.

615
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,580
I didn't know if it would auto whatever.

616
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,740
It doesn't.

617
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,700
Which way do I go?

618
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,340
Do I go this way?

619
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,020
Use your heart, I trust you.

620
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,180
Are you saying that's because I'm Asian?

621
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:42,980
What?

622
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,140
No.

623
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,900
I used my heart.

624
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,020
I thought you were a guinea pig.

625
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,620
Exactly.

626
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,180
I can be both.

627
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,140
Ginea pigs can't be Asian.

628
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,060
You still can.

629
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,180
Are they Asian breeds of guinea pigs?

630
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,780
No, but you know, cuppy bars are loved by all of Asia.

631
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,580
So if you think about it, it's kind of like close enough.

632
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:58,980
That's true.

633
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,380
They are pretty, they are the biggest guinea pig.

634
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,940
Cuppy bars are the largest rodents.

635
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,460
Really?

636
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,500
Probably not.

637
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,660
They have like bristle hairs.

638
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,220
Yeah.

639
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,700
Yeah, it's kind of like a broom.

640
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,020
I think we go this way.

641
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,740
Have you ever touched a cuppy bar?

642
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,620
No, but I'm going on in October to Japan.

643
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,700
I'm going to go touch one.

644
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,260
I'm going to see them in the onsen.

645
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,300
I'm going to touch it.

646
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,900
I'm going to pet it.

647
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,540
You're going to join the cuppy bar a suit?

648
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,820
Are we still going to a cuppy bar?

649
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,740
No, I don't think we're allowed to.

650
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,620
If I could have with them.

651
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,620
You can't bathe with them?

652
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,740
What's the point?

653
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,340
Hold on, hold on.

654
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,740
Did you know that they poop in the water?

655
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,460
Oh, OK.

656
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,660
Yeah, so do I.

657
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
And?

658
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,660
That's way past.

659
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,300
In the water that you bathed in me?

660
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,460
Wait, that's why there's that flutter in the pool?

661
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,660
That's why there's that flutter in the pool?

662
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,660
Crazy.

663
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,140
Where are you?

664
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,100
She took us the long way.

665
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,580
Well, I didn't know there was another direction on my bed.

666
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,660
You know you're fine.

667
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,460
I'm just teasing you.

668
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,500
Wait, there's a short way?

669
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,220
Someone say short?

670
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,180
Like you?

671
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:01,780
I'm not short.

672
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,020
I'm taller than you.

673
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,340
No, you're not.

674
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,140
Well, how tall are you?

675
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,100
5'2".

676
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,580
I'm 5'3".

677
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,820
No way.

678
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,980
I'm 5'3", so this is my dick.

679
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,780
Wow.

680
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,540
It's my balls.

681
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,540
You think that 1 inch saves you?

682
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,500
Yeah, the 1 inch to figure, the 1 inch to figure.

683
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,860
The 1 inch to figure, the 1 inch to figure.

684
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,660
The 1 inch to figure, the 1 inch to figure.

685
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,620
Oh my god, look at that.

686
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,220
Look at that monster.

687
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,860
He's wearing a goat's head monster?

688
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,020
Yeah, a monster over here.

689
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,780
Let's go over here.

690
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,140
He has a long ass tongue.

691
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,860
Oh, is that a tongue?

692
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,700
I think he has a tongue.

693
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,140
He's got a tongue, yeah.

694
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,340
I think he's going to zoom in.

695
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
There's a way to do it.

696
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,620
I can't remember how, though.

697
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,620
Is it tilde?

698
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,660
Tilde to zoom in.

699
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,540
No, it's not tilde.

700
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,380
I think that's to bring up the console, isn't it?

701
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,380
How do you zoom in?

702
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,380
Stop this.

703
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,980
What Emmy needs to figure out is how to spawn us when we fall off,

704
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,180
because we can restart at little checkpoint places.

705
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,900
Oh, we can?

706
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,460
No, we're raw dogging it.

707
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,620
You want to start raw dog this?

708
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,980
That means you can't fail.

709
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,180
We have to do it all in one go.

710
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,620
Which way do we go from here?

711
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,780
Remember that time I was playing with you,

712
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,860
and you kept saying stuff about, wait, we found this spot.

713
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,860
Oh, OK, Emmy, it looks like we're going, Emmy.

714
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,860
It looks like we're going, Emmy.

715
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,860
He doesn't jump on the rock.

716
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,180
He said, where are we going?

717
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,180
And I said, we're off.

718
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,660
He said, you're like, OK.

719
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,860
None of us made it long to go.

720
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,860
Please pull me off.

721
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,860
No, no, no, no.

722
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,940
Oh, shit.

723
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,940
Oh, shit.

724
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,940
No.

725
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,940
No.

726
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,940
You guys are saying that we do this all in one go?

727
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,940
You guys are saying about that respawn.

728
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,540
Let's all agree that this was Emmy's fault.

729
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,940
None of us are ready to go yet.

730
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,940
I was talking.

731
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,940
I jumped on the rock.

732
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,940
I jumped on the rock.

733
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,940
I didn't say jump.

734
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,940
You asked me, where are we going?

735
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,940
And I said, we're going to that rock.

736
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,940
OK, so I went to the right.

737
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,940
Wait, this way.

738
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,940
Wait, but how do we respawn?

739
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,020
Tell me the button.

740
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,020
I honestly don't know.

741
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,020
I think Apollo did it.

742
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,020
How are you going to tease us with it and not let us do it?

743
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,020
Wait, hold on.

744
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,020
Let me look it up, then.

745
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:18,020
I think it's like, I think the way it's done is something like you.

746
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,020
You press a button.

747
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,020
It's in the menu, right?

748
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,020
Oh, it's a button?

749
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,020
Well, I think it's, I don't know.

750
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,020
I'm just guessing.

751
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,020
There is a button that you press.

752
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,020
Are you making out with me, but I'm your sibling?

753
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,020
Self-sist.

754
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,100
What's that?

755
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,100
My friend Hachi would be totally into that.

756
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,100
Huki, are you eating on me?

757
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,100
Identical twin old man.

758
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,100
We have a friend Hachi.

759
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,100
And Hachi loves Genji Exonzo.

760
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,100
And we make fun of it.

761
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,100
I don't blame her.

762
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,100
What?

763
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
I think I'm traumatized again.

764
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,100
You're always not allowed to watch.

765
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,180
566 meters?

766
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,180
No.

767
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,180
I don't think we got that far.

768
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,180
I'm sorry.

769
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,180
I'm playing on normal mode.

770
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,180
There's no checkpoints on normal mode.

771
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,180
I told you.

772
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,180
All right.

773
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,180
I think it's raw dogging it.

774
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,180
I don't think this counts as a fall because that was our tutorial.

775
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,180
You know, we had to warm up first.

776
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,180
Warm up.

777
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,180
Guys, we are going to.

778
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,180
OK.

779
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,180
Hachi will never live that down.

780
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,180
Nope.

781
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,180
She traumatized me, and now she's stuck with it.

782
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:30,260
I'm on the pause menu, then teleport at the center of the screen.

783
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,260
But we are in normal mode.

784
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,260
It doesn't have.

785
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,260
Sorry.

786
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,260
I thought I didn't want to be a scrub and choose easy mode,

787
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,260
you know?

788
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,260
No, we're gamers.

789
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,260
We're gamers.

790
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,260
We got this.

791
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,260
We're stinky.

792
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,260
We're gamers.

793
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,260
Of course.

794
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,260
I shower.

795
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,260
I don't know about you.

796
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,260
Well, you shower every four days.

797
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,260
That still means I shower.

798
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,260
Is that a problem?

799
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,260
How often do you shower?

800
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,260
Oh, we could take the shortcut to the right.

801
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,260
That's a shortcut?

802
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,260
Yeah.

803
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,260
Is it?

804
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,260
Go for it.

805
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,260
Yeah.

806
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,260
OK.

807
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,260
Sure.

808
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,260
I didn't know this was a shortcut.

809
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,260
Me neither.

810
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,260
Why didn't we do this the first time?

811
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,260
Because I didn't see the first time.

812
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,260
I was just following you all.

813
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:16,260
Look, we did it.

814
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,260
We did it.

815
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,260
The pros already.

816
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,260
Short cut nothing to it.

817
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,260
I wonder how far.

818
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,260
I hope we get to at least to the car.

819
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,260
There's a car?

820
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,260
There's a car?

821
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,260
We've gotten to the car?

822
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,260
No.

823
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,260
See, she like rage quit.

824
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,260
Last time we played it.

825
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,260
Who rage quit?

826
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,260
You.

827
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,260
Not even two hours and she all test fours.

828
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,260
I may have done that.

829
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:44,260
You can just move your mouse and like slowly turn it as you walk.

830
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,260
No, I'm too nervous.

831
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,260
No, we're speed running there.

832
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,260
Someone's slowing us down here.

833
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,260
Yeah, it's freaky.

834
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,260
I'm too scared to move forward.

835
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,260
They want to fall off.

836
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,260
Beautiful.

837
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,260
I'll catch you.

838
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,260
Don't worry.

839
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,260
Thanks.

840
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,260
You'll catch me?

841
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,260
I'll catch you.

842
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,260
Wait, so who's seen Gravity Falls here?

843
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,260
Me.

844
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,260
I've seen a little bit of it.

845
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,260
I found out the other days that apparently Mabel was supposed to die.

846
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,260
In the show and Disney said no.

847
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,260
I would say no too.

848
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,260
Mabel's really cute.

849
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,260
I love Mabel.

850
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,260
They wanted like a sacrifice kind of thing going on.

851
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,260
No.

852
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:30,260
First kids are a place of like a generation of kids.

853
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,260
I'm sorry.

854
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,260
I had a brain aneurysm.

855
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:40,260
Listen, you know, the death of a character is character development.

856
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,260
Look at us in sync.

857
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,260
End of the show.

858
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,260
What more development do you need at the end of the show?

859
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,260
No, no, no.

860
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,260
It was like just overall she was supposed to die.

861
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,260
I don't know where.

862
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,260
Oh, like in general at some point in the show.

863
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,260
The first pilot of the show basically killed her.

864
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
We don't like her.

865
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,260
Get her out of there.

866
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,260
The pilot though, the pilot was such an adult version.

867
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,260
Was it?

868
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,260
You know, you guys can get off here, right?

869
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,260
No, no, no.

870
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,260
We're going the whole way.

871
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,260
Okay.

872
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,260
How do I get off?

873
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,260
Okay.

874
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,260
Look at the speed runner here.

875
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,260
Okay, ready?

876
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,260
Yeah.

877
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,260
Go.

878
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,260
Oh, what?

879
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

880
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,260
What are we not making?

881
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,260
Oh.

882
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,260
Oh, God, God, God.

883
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,260
Oh, I'm going to my fault or not.

884
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,260
I'm kind of confused.

885
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,260
It was not me.

886
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,260
It was the last one.

887
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,260
I was the last one.

888
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,260
Yeah, it was exactly, yeah, exactly.

889
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,260
You dragged them down.

890
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,260
She's too late.

891
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,260
Yeah, I'm fine.

892
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:38,260
Are you sure you don't want to do the teleport thing?

893
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,260
Okay, we'd have to leave the restart.

894
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,760
Yeah, we'd have to leave the game so I can change it to easy mode, I think.

895
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,260
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

896
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,400
You know what? Honestly, we're so early, you know.

897
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,140
We're not going to be losing any progress.

898
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,940
We won't. Is it a different map?

899
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,640
I don't think so. No, it's the same map.

900
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,340
OK, well, let's teleport to where you fell from.

901
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,580
You want to do that? Yeah, I'll do it.

902
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,320
But don't you think chat would want us to be in pain?

903
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,180
Yes, they do. OK, chat. Chat, what do you think?

904
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,860
I think chat's on our side.

905
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,060
Don't give them a chance to respond

906
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,220
because we already know what they're going to say.

907
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,660
They're going to say, oh my god, you guys should totally go in easy mode

908
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,060
because once you guys enjoy yourselves.

909
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,100
I believe I believe you and wait.

910
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,540
I believe I'm going to do double Dutch.

911
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,340
What's a double Dutch?

912
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,540
Oh, you don't know what double Dutch is?

913
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,900
No, is it an American thing?

914
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,140
No, it's like, like when you're jump roping.

915
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,100
Yeah, and you got two long ropes and you need three people.

916
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,020
So two people are like, yeah.

917
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,340
You never asked.

918
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,180
Did you ever skip rope, Emmy?

919
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:42,580
I guess I didn't have the friends for double Dutch as a kid.

920
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,340
Well, I only did it because I was out of my man

921
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,780
in an after school program because I was dumb.

922
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,060
OK, well, they said we're not dumb.

923
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,300
They said we have to suffer for their amusement.

924
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,700
Yeah, my chat also said hard motor bust.

925
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,780
Bust? Can we bust?

926
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,540
What does bust mean? I can bust.

927
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,740
Bust a move. I can't crouch.

928
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,740
So I can't work.

929
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,740
Guys, please.

930
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,340
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

931
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,540
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

932
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,020
Why are you just committing suicide all over there?

933
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,260
I thought we were ready to go.

934
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,260
I got eight jumps.

935
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,260
Ready to go?

936
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,260
Ready to go.

937
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,580
OK, I can't read your mind, y'all.

938
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,260
Well, try.

939
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,620
Try harder. I'm trying my hardest.

940
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,060
My telepathy is out of.

941
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,020
We should be. We're literally vibing.

942
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,900
You guys were like, I have to jump off right now.

943
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,140
We were vibing with each other.

944
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,900
See, we were like, oh, it's time to go.

945
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:38,140
Maybe maybe we need to swap the flats with the the the mommies.

946
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,980
What do you mean by that?

947
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,380
I don't know.

948
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,780
What do you mean by that?

949
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:49,660
It means in me is is the flight that goes with Shabby's mommy.

950
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,700
And I don't want to live anymore.

951
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,700
She's.

952
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,940
You're trying to replace me.

953
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,940
Yes.

954
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,940
You're trying to replace me.

955
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,740
What do you mean by that?

956
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,220
Well, I mean, you should be is a rabbit.

957
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,180
And I am a guinea pig.

958
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,420
So like to a bitch and who's going to feed you?

959
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,300
I could cheat her because I'll share my snacks.

960
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,980
Yeah, we eat the same food.

961
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,780
Yeah, basically.

962
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,620
I don't like carrots.

963
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,140
What do you like?

964
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,620
Lettuce.

965
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,700
I'll feed you some lettuce.

966
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,340
Do you like arugula?

967
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,340
Arugula.

968
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,980
I mean, I'll eat it.

969
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,900
You like zucchini.

970
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,740
My mom just grew some zucchini in her garden.

971
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,900
Oh, my God, I love zucchini.

972
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,900
And she's a little guinea pig.

973
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,500
Do anything else with it.

974
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,180
Actually, you know, my guinea pigs,

975
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,980
the ones I owned, ready?

976
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,380
Um, we fed them like exotic Asian fruits.

977
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,820
Damn.

978
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,820
Impressive, like what?

979
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,220
Do you guys know, like, like leechy?

980
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,820
Oh, yeah, we gave them leechy.

981
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,300
We gave them a rambutan.

982
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,460
Mangosteen.

983
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,060
Oh, damn.

984
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,340
Those are some well fed.

985
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,380
Yeah, they were fast.

986
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,780
They were fat.

987
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,820
Of course, guinea pigs are always

988
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,020
really cute.

989
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,420
Ready?

990
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,940
Quite a ton.

991
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,180
Oh, please.

992
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:17,780
OK, we did it.

993
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,100
We did it.

994
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,940
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

995
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,260
It's OK.

996
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:21,860
I'm going to make it.

997
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,060
Wait, wait, wait, OK, ready?

998
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,700
Ready?

999
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,700
Yeah, yeah.

1000
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,700
Go.

1001
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,700
OK, I do not like these cablings.

1002
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,700
We're so good at this.

1003
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,420
We're so good at this.

1004
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,420
Don't say that right here.

1005
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,860
Every time we say that, we.

1006
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,700
OK, so we got a.

1007
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,620
We got a.

1008
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,740
Climb up here.

1009
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,940
And I can't climb for some reason.

1010
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,540
Oh, it's this again.

1011
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,060
Yep.

1012
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,780
And then we got to be able to jump on the rocks later.

1013
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,300
If you look up, you can see where we are.

1014
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,500
Look up.

1015
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,300
Oh, I don't want to look up.

1016
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,740
Did you see your cheeks?

1017
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,740
Look down.

1018
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,220
Oh.

1019
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,780
Here, the screams of the dams.

1020
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,260
Very nice.

1021
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,060
Are we in hell right now?

1022
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,180
It's kind of like Florida.

1023
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,980
Yeah, I was going to say Florida.

1024
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,340
You don't like Florida?

1025
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,220
No, I've been multiple times.

1026
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,420
What is Florida ever to do with?

1027
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,140
I went to Florida and they had a lot of little.

1028
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,020
I don't like Gators.

1029
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,620
They do don't like Gators.

1030
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,340
Oh, I like the one of the iguanas.

1031
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,540
Oh, it's kind of cool.

1032
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,220
But you don't like the dog of the.

1033
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,780
You call me.

1034
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,860
No, I just don't like alligators.

1035
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,860
They are scary.

1036
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,380
It tastes really good, though.

1037
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,500
What's up?

1038
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:47,260
But it's just the way that you're like walking.

1039
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,780
It's so funny to me.

1040
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,220
It's the meta.

1041
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,260
She's just like tap W to me.

1042
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:57,820
I don't want to be the reason we are walking at like normal.

1043
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,740
Everybody else is going like this.

1044
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,100
Look, we're cautious.

1045
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,500
Sorry if we fall.

1046
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,980
It should be small.

1047
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,980
Yeah, I saw that.

1048
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,340
She jumped up.

1049
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,220
I'm trying.

1050
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,660
He jumped up forward.

1051
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,980
Jump up in front of you.

1052
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,580
He forgot how to hit.

1053
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,380
Almost killed us.

1054
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,180
Almost killed us.

1055
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,260
I was pressing the space bar.

1056
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,100
OK.

1057
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,420
I don't want it.

1058
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,420
OK, OK, OK.

1059
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:26,940
Ready?

1060
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,580
Ready?

1061
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,220
Where do we go?

1062
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:28,900
Where do we go?

1063
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,420
Aim at that stationary rock.

1064
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,020
You see that rock with the vines?

1065
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1066
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,140
Go for the vine.

1067
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,460
Go for the vine.

1068
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:35,940
Ready?

1069
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,220
Yes.

1070
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:40,100
3, 2, 1, go.

1071
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,100
Oh, we're going to make it.

1072
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,700
OK.

1073
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,540
OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.

1074
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,380
And then we're going to time this.

1075
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,460
Yeah, and then we got to just like run and book it.

1076
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:47,940
OK?

1077
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,460
OK.

1078
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,500
Rock over there.

1079
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,740
Run button.

1080
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,740
Shift.

1081
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,220
Shift?

1082
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,020
OK, OK.

1083
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,540
I'm ready.

1084
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:53,980
You guys ready?

1085
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1086
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,740
We got the next one.

1087
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,140
OK.

1088
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:57,740
This one.

1089
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,300
This one.

1090
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:58,860
This one.

1091
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,980
Go.

1092
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,540
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

1093
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,040
OK.

1094
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
Ah.

1095
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,220
We did it.

1096
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,720
We climbed the ladder.

1097
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,720
Come on, look at that.

1098
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,120
Wait, are we still in hard mode?

1099
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,960
No, we're in normal mode.

1100
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,200
No, no, this is hard mode.

1101
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,600
I don't think there's a hard or mode.

1102
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,280
I think it's either normal or easy.

1103
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,240
No, there was a hard mode, I think.

1104
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,920
Oh, I wonder what that would be like then.

1105
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,640
Hard mode.

1106
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,640
Everything's faster.

1107
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,040
I don't think there is checkpoints at all on this one.

1108
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,920
OK, jump.

1109
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,000
OK, so for this one.

1110
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,560
You climb the ladder, you got to time it,

1111
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,560
because you can see the little thingies.

1112
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,320
The what?

1113
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:37,820
Oh.

1114
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,600
The little spikes.

1115
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,600
Spikes.

1116
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,400
OK, wait, let's look at the little spikes.

1117
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
No, Amy.

1118
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,000
OK, now we can go.

1119
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,560
OK, OK, OK.

1120
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,060
OK.

1121
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,560
Pause.

1122
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,920
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1123
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,280
OK, OK, OK, OK.

1124
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,080
Very good.

1125
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,880
Who was that?

1126
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,480
I don't know.

1127
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,760
I think it was all of us.

1128
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,760
No, no, no, I think it was like, I don't know.

1129
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,440
Maybe it was me.

1130
00:40:59,440 --> 00:40:59,960
I don't know.

1131
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,600
You can blame me.

1132
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,080
OK.

1133
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,600
OK.

1134
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,560
OK, we got it this time.

1135
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,800
Alcohol.

1136
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,240
Oh, we're going to get hit.

1137
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,960
We're going to get hit.

1138
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,640
No, we're not.

1139
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1140
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,000
The ladder.

1141
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,800
It's fine.

1142
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,000
OK.

1143
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,640
Maybe we're just bad at this timing thing.

1144
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,520
I thought it was easier to see them from the side.

1145
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:18,840
Do you want to?

1146
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,360
OK.

1147
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,280
Oh, true, duh.

1148
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,080
So like, look at them from the side.

1149
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,000
Oh.

1150
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,120
OK.

1151
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,000
OK.

1152
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,280
I'll stack up right here.

1153
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,120
Help.

1154
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1155
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,400
OK.

1156
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:38,000
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1157
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,840
Oh, OK.

1158
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,200
OK, go a little closer.

1159
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,240
You're going to go a little closer.

1160
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,080
OK.

1161
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,840
OK, wait for it.

1162
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,200
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1163
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,240
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1164
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,680
OK, this one we're going to get messed up on a lot.

1165
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,320
Like, this one.

1166
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:52,720
No, we didn't.

1167
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:52,840
Shut up.

1168
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,600
You're jinxing it.

1169
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,480
No, no, we're fine.

1170
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,840
I'm just being.

1171
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,480
I'm just being.

1172
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,840
Look, we're geniuses.

1173
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,360
We all have two brain cells.

1174
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:09,160
together. They make six. Wait, I was going to say that makes two. So you know where I'm at in this.

1175
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:21,240
I was about to say. We have two brain cells each. That makes six. Two, eight, ten. Wait, two, four,

1176
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,960
six, eight. I think we all lost one because of that. No, no, no, no, no, no. I didn't say anything.

1177
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,960
Okay, ready? You guys want to get to the edge of glory right over here? Okay, okay. A little

1178
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,320
we're going to go. We're going to edge ourselves. We got to time it. Okay.

1179
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:38,440
Okay. Wait, do we do it when it's close? Next one. Yeah, I'm going to jump. So jump.

1180
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,520
Don't jump. Oh, you got a backward. Oh, never mind.

1181
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:50,520
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are we stalled? Why are you always pulling everyone up?

1182
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,400
I'm lagging a little bit. I'm lagging a little bit.

1183
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:02,440
Okay, you're going to get me. I'm going to get me. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. Okay, I got it. Oh my

1184
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:09,160
God, you're God. You're literally carrying us right now. A gamer is putting into work right now.

1185
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,160
So we got to jump, then jump. You got to kind of like, you got to like pull. So look at me.

1186
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,240
Well, you guys can see me. It doesn't matter. I don't know why I'm asking you to turn around.

1187
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,880
So you got to kind of like jump, but then like press the back button to bring yourself backwards.

1188
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:38,040
You said a lot and I did not know what you said. So W jump. WS. WS. WS. Space WS. Space WS.

1189
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:45,720
Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. You don't want to overshoot it. Yeah, when do we jump? Next one?

1190
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,080
Let's do the next one, not this one. I'm so nervous. It's going to jump whenever everybody else

1191
00:43:53,080 --> 00:44:03,320
does. Okay. Thank God. We did it. Oh my God. It's like excited little jump. She's like, yeah.

1192
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,600
Oh my God. There's a countdown. What? There's a countdown? Yeah, I just read the chat and they

1193
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:17,320
said it's three. R. R? What? What is this countdown for? Oh, it's time to go together. Oh, okay.

1194
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:25,240
Okay. I felt like how we don't do it at the time. We don't need a countdown. We got this. Yeah,

1195
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:30,600
we got scared. Stop it. Watch how you fall. Go. These look like triscuits. They do look like

1196
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:36,520
triscuits. I want triscuits. I don't actually do. Which direction? What's a triscuit this way?

1197
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:41,080
You don't know what a triscuit is? No. It's serial. I don't even know how to explain it. No, it's

1198
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:47,240
like a triscuit. You know miniweeds like frosted miniweeds. It's that.

1199
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,760
Wait. What is this? We have to accept it.

1200
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,520
Let's stop being stupid. Let's stop being stupid. You fucking asshole. I didn't make it.

1201
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,600
Okay. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. We have to. No, guys. We got to just,

1202
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:10,040
you got to jump. Jump, jump, jump. Oh, jump. Oh, oh, oh. I got it. I got it. We got it. We got it.

1203
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:15,080
What's that about? Yeah. Maybe I got to put more faith in us then. I'm sorry. It's okay.

1204
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:20,440
You forget. We're gamers. All four of us gamers. We're going to breed. Those brain cells are going

1205
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,680
crazy right now. Those six brain cells. Oh, shit.

1206
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:33,240
Wait, where do we go from here? To the side. Oh, okay. There we go. And then we go up.

1207
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,880
Inside. Oh, there's our house. There's a ladder right here. This is where we live.

1208
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:48,600
We live now. It's my basement. A basement. Yeah. I'll be, I'll be the stern mother that works.

1209
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,440
Jimmy is literally a pit of me of a potato.

1210
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:01,880
Oh, my God.

1211
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,920
Okay. So this has lasers that will knock us off. Does anybody want to take a rest in the

1212
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:14,840
hut before we continue? Yeah. How do we crowd? I don't think there is a crowd. I think we should

1213
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:21,720
make out. I would just make out. This is the goon shack. I love you. The goon shack, yeah.

1214
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:30,840
I found out the other day what, what a female gooner is. What's a female gooner? What's a

1215
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:38,520
goonette? Goonette? Yeah, a goonette. It sounds like a band. It does. It sounds like also on the

1216
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:51,240
goonettes. Ready? Okay. Jump when it gets close to you. Yeah. Run. Oh, my God. Okay, we're good.

1217
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:59,800
God, nice job. I don't know where we go from here. Are you clenched? Oh, do we jump to the right?

1218
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:06,200
No, do we jump to up here? Do we reach it? Yeah, I think we can reach it. Yeah, I think we can like

1219
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:15,720
run. Yeah, yeah. Ready? One, two, three, go. Go touch the trampoline. Okay, ready? Okay, ready?

1220
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:22,920
Yeah. Where do we jump to? Right in front of us. Oh, the trampoline. Go. Nice, nice, nice. The trampoline.

1221
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,080
Oh, my God. Oh, no.

1222
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:40,360
It's fine. It's fine. I know what's happened. Again, Emmy carrying us. I can't get up.

1223
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:48,680
Emmy, Emmy, actually, you know what I want to do? Can you grab that hook? Can you jump up and grab it?

1224
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,800
Okay. Help me, please. Okay, I'm grabbing it.

1225
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:01,800
When do I let go? Don't let go. When do I let go? You'll know when. Just don't let go.

1226
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:10,840
Or I will cry profusely. Well, how am I supposed to know when I'm supposed to know?

1227
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,320
Because we're going to be near a platform. Don't worry. We are here. You'll know. You'll know deep in

1228
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:23,480
your heart. Okay. If you hold on for too long, what does it do? Oh, is this it? We're almost there.

1229
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:34,840
Here we are. It's the car. Okay, so whoever gets in the car first will drive. I don't want to drive.

1230
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:43,400
Wait, wait, but before we go, let me explain. Okay, okay. There are obstacles. You may fall off the

1231
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:49,560
map if we fall off the map, but then we got to do this all over. Okay? Okay. Not it. I'm an amazing

1232
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:57,080
driver. Not it. I don't trust you. I don't trust you. You're the biker. Yeah, you're a biker. You

1233
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:03,000
should know what you're doing. Don't go too fast. Don't go too fast. Don't be speeding now.

1234
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,880
Oh, no. Wait, speed limit, please. There we go.

1235
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,760
We might die.

1236
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,760
You know, you guys don't trust me. I can't do this.

1237
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:17,960
No, it's cold.

1238
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,120
Where did you get your driver's license?

1239
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,760
What do you mean? I'm rocks. Please watch out for the rocks.

1240
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,240
You don't trust me. I'm hearing a lot of doubt in your voices right now. A lot of doubt.

1241
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,960
Oh, I'm so scared. We're going to get so scared.

1242
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:51,720
I'm so scared. We don't have to go too much. Okay.

1243
00:49:53,080 --> 00:50:00,200
Mip has hit every single one of us down. We made it. We made it, didn't we? We did. We did.

1244
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:09,640
Amazing job, Mip, honestly. I knew I had precious cargo. I had three precious packages

1245
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,240
in the back. I couldn't crash for you guys. I can't recall if this is a checkpoint or not.

1246
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,920
I don't think we get checkpoints. Oh, my God. I was laughing so hard. I was crying.

1247
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,680
Even in the normal, they're like checkpoints. Okay, good. Oh, my God. I was crying.

1248
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:31,240
Have you gotten this far before? No. No. Okay. Let me explain. Okay. I see it's twisting.

1249
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,680
Oh, is it Cuba? Yes. So you literally just have to run. Don't do it yet.

1250
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:43,000
Wait. I paused. You got to jump almost. What? Yeah. When did my model change?

1251
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,000
Oh, what? What do you mean? Why are you a different dude?

1252
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,960
I was an old guy, and now I'm not.

1253
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,680
Look, you got none. No, you're not. Just ask, what is the problem?

1254
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,280
I guess it's the one we got in the car.

1255
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,640
Holy shit. You got you. You're not the new character.

1256
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,960
Probably when we got in the car. No, no, no. I was still the old guy when we were in the car.

1257
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:21,000
My driving changed you. You're driving made me like age. Yeah. Yeah. I was just a good driver.

1258
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,960
And it made me probably age even more absorbed for elderlyness. Okay. Okay. Okay. So literally,

1259
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,480
you just have to stand on top of it after you climb to the top and just jump with the spins.

1260
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:37,000
Huh? Okay. Yeah. I did not understand anything. Do I just jump in general when it spins?

1261
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,080
Yeah. You just jump in general. Oh, you just stand still and jump? Yeah. So you can jump onto it now.

1262
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:49,560
Good luck. Okay. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. It's going to rotate. I can't even get up, bro.

1265
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,280
Okay, and then jump off

1266
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:29,000
Okay, this one we just have to like climb it's not really big. Okay. Okay. How do we come this?

1267
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,120
Oh, we jump when it gets closer. Yeah

Oh, I'm my eyes are actually blurred from laughing so hard

1326
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,760
I can't

1327
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,760
I can't jump

1328
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,000
I'm in the wall

1329
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000

00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,960

Hi

1333
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,160
I changed characters and I was wondering if I could go back to being an old guy

1334
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,080
Oh, wait, is you changed characters because you clicked on wait, what?

1335
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:17,640
I stood in there is when I noticed I changed characters. I thought maybe if I did it again, I could be the old guy

1336
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:21,720
Maybe I don't know why I changed you. Maybe you gotta get to another checkpoint

1337
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:27,400
Or that why can't we all be an old guy? Well, I don't want to be old and ugly. I don't want to be old

1338
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,640
You're saying I'm old and ugly

1339
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,040
Look at that model. He definitely gets bitches. Look at him. I'm pulling you all towards me. Emmy. You're lucky

1340

01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:35,880
Oh, we got it. We got it. We got it. We got to win. I can't see

01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:09,520
Okay, I guess we're just going a little bit easier. Oh my God. Maybe not. Maybe. Maybe it's not so easy.

1364
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:14,520
Oh no. Oh no. Not the falto. Not the falto at the end. The falto, please.

1365
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:20,520
I got you. Okay, I can't help. Viv's gonna have to do it. Oh my God. This is hard.

1366
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,520
You're gonna have to do it. You're gonna have to pull Viv. You're gonna have to pull Viv.

1368
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:33,520
Okay, I got Amy. Okay, we got all the useful people. Can we turn around? Let me turn around.

1369
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:40,520
Oh, I did that. I saved you. Yeah, after you endangered us half the game. There we go.

1370
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:45,520
I did not do that. I'm at the end. It's not my fault. All right, there's a trampoline. Be mindful of it.

1371
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:54,520
Okay, I will be mindful. Ready? Are you serious? Are you serious?

1372
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:00,520
Are you serious?

1373
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:11,520
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I went through the island.

1374
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,520
Okay. That's crazy. Who could have done that? That's wild.

1375
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:22,520
That's crazy. I said, watch out.

1376
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:29,520
I said, oops. I said, oops.

1377
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:34,520
All right, let's jump onto this rock, ladies. Okay. Okay.

1378
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:41,520
This is the way any one of you. Okay. It doesn't matter which direction you go in.

1379
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:48,520
Oh, there are dead ends. You're not letting me. But you'll see the dead ends because we gotta wait for Stoppy.

1380
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:57,520
Okay. You're fucking out. What just happened? Okay, all right.

1381
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:05,520
Oh, no, this is the nearest safe location. I tried to teleport to the nearest safe location.

1382
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:12,520
So should we go into easy mode? Wait, there's no safe point? No, I don't see one in any of the settings.

1383
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:16,520
Can we go to easy mode now, please? Chad, can we have permission for easy mode?

1384
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:22,520
I don't think we should. Everyone's on your side. Does it have to be the person who's running the thing to do it?

1385
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:28,520
I think I have to just restart it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Chad, can we do it?

1386
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:33,520
Oh, my God. That was so funny.

1387
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:39,520
My computer is struggling right now. Everybody is in like two frames per second.

1388
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:43,520
We're in PowerPoint mode.

1389
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,520
That was so funny. Oh, my God.

1390
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:51,520
Okay, it's going to be the same. Oh, wait. If I type in the password, oh, no, they can't see. Okay, that's good.

1391
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:58,520
Just get rid of it real quick. Get rid of what? Like hide the game. Just kill me. Just do it.

1392
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:04,520
Okay, same password. Same password. And it's going to be beginner mode. Yeah, okay.

1393
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:09,520
Finally, we're free. Should I do closed chain? No. I don't know what that means.

1394
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,520
So it's we're all connected to each other rather than being like a line. Yeah, we're all connected to each other.

1395
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:20,520
Wait, no. Don't do that. Okay, okay. Wait, wouldn't that be easier? No. No.

1396
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:27,520
Wait, did you open the thing? I'm creating the session right now. Oh, we're just inpatient. Sorry.

1397
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:33,520
There you go. You can join. Should we all be old men? Yes.

1398
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:40,520
There's Steve from Minecraft. I'd rather be a hag, honestly. Is there even a hag? No, I'm not a hag.

1399
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:49,520
Wait, that's wrong password. Oh, shit. What did you do? I swear I put the same password. Let me just check what I wrote in there.

1400
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:59,520
Did you spell it wrong? I wouldn't do that. I'm going to join last so I can be at the end. Post a game.

1401
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:08,520
Yeah, you need your goats at the end, huh? You know what? The two mommies need to be the front and the caboose that's in there.

1402
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:14,520
Well, that would mean that me. Sandwich us. I'm a baby. Mommy, me, me, momma, momma.

1403
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:19,520
I require mommy, milky, please. I'm a baby.

1404
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,520
Okay, I made it again.

1405
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:30,520
Welcome to the bathroom real quick. Don't start the game without me.

1406
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:34,520
Don't start the game without you? Don't start the game without me.

1407
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:42,520
Just drag her like a corpse. Yeah.

1408
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:49,520
I can't get in. Is this wrong password? You got to refresh it. You got to refresh it. Is this wrong password again?

1409
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:56,520
Hold on, let me refresh. Can you guys not spell the password? No. Wait. Okay, I'm in. Okay, okay, now I'll be right back.

1410
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:02,520
I think you just had to like refresh it. Yeah, I had to refresh the entire thingy.

1411
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:06,520
Should we all just be buff men? No, I want to be an old guy.

1412
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:12,520
He looks like his name is like Walter. If I'm a buff guy, will I be able to carry people better?

1413
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:17,520
No, I don't think so. But I need to go to the bathroom too. I'll go real quick.

1414
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:23,520
Let's see. You know when you load it in, I thought it said skibbity.

1415
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:28,520
Wow, I can't believe you've said that. I'm so sorry. The brain rot.

1416
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:33,520
No, it's okay. I'll say what the shibbity a lot. So it's fine.

1417
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:38,520
What the shibbity?

1418
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:43,520
We can't even start the game without her. So I don't know why she thinks we can.

1419
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,520
I would have dragged both of them, honestly, and blamed them if we fell.

1420
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,520
Look at their little bodies.

1421
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:55,520
Aw, they look so cute. Oh, I just realized. So far off those ears flick.

1422
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:59,520
That's really adorable. That is really cute.

1423
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,520
And then Amy has a snot bubble when she sleeps, but I do too.

1424
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:08,520
You do? Yeah, I did that. I don't know if it'll work because I might have taken it off.

1425
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:15,520
No. Sometimes if I just like go off to the side too far, I just like fall asleep.

1426
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:20,520
It's like how Emmys is right now. Man, it takes a long piss.

1427
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:24,520
You know, some people wash their hands. Is that new to you?

1428
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:28,520
You want to smell them? It's fire cracker. I bet you just rinse your hands with the water.

1429
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:32,520
You don't even put soap on it. No, I use bath and body work soap. You know, I'm a sink queen.

1430
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:36,520
She washes, she dips her hands in the toilet after.

1431
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:40,520
You know when I was crazy? Me?

1432
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:56,520
No. You know, sometimes if you have the toilet and then if it's too forceful, it's too powerful, the water will splash up.

1433
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:00,520
Are you talking about when we sit on the toilet and we piss hard, the water will splash back on us?

1434
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:04,520
No, no, no. When you're flushing it and sometimes it gets on the seat.

1435
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:07,520
No. So it happens in like public restroom sometimes.

1436
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:11,520
If I see that, I immediately just go to a different bathroom.

1437
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,520
Same. I hold it. Like I can't deal with that.

1438
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:18,520
Just piss. Just squat over the seat. Don't sit down. Just squat.

1439
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:21,520
I don't like squatting. I'll just bare ass it.

1440
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,520
I can't squat. I mean, I can, but like I don't like it.

1441
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,520
So you'll bare ass stick your ass on a nasty toilet seat if you had to?

1442
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,520
No, I just hold it.

1443
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,520
I'll do it.

1444
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,520
I've had to. The only time I squized in a porta potty because hell no.

1445
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,520
I don't have it in me to use a porta potty. I think I'd rather pee.

1446
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:45,520
I've never used a porta potty. When I went to a run fair, I had to use a porta potty because I was really going to piss myself.

1447
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,520
You could have bottled it.

1448
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,520
I don't. I did not have a bottle nearby.

1449
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:54,520
I've had to pee in a cup for a doctor's appointment before and I hated it.

1450
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,520
Yeah. Peeing in a cup is fun.

1451
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,520
It makes me nervous because then I can't pee.

1452
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:03,520
And then they're like, are you done yet? And I'm like, no, I can't.

1453
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,520
I just go into Zen mode and I breathe deeply.

1454
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:12,520
And then I just go as you.

1455
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,520
And then as I blow out, I piss.

1456
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:17,520
Are you a strong pisser or like a gentle pisser?

1457
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,520
I'm a gentle pisser.

1458
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,520
What's the difference?

1459
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,520
I just let it dribble.

1460
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,520
You know, I don't have to force it.

1461
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,520
What?

1462
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,520
I like forcing it. I think it feels nice.

1463
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,520
I have a great pelvic floor strength, though. Don't get it twisted.

1464
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,520
No, no, I believe you. I believe it's great.

1465
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,520
You think it feels nice to force it out?

1466
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,520
Yeah.

1467
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,520
It does. 100%. I love it.

1468
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,520
If you just like really piss really hard.

1469
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,520
You're like, ugh.

1470
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,520
Just like generally.

1471
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,520
What is he? How hard I can piss?

1472
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,520
You like that, baby?

1473
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,520
Check it in there.

1474
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,520
Pissing all by yourself handsome.

1475
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:55,520
Oh my.

1476
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,520
Oh my God.

1477
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,520
Yes. You want to hold my hand while I piss?

1478
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,520
I think Viv has met her match.

1479
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,520
Hello.

1480
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,520
I see a lot of myself in Viv.

1481
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:05,520
You know.

1482
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,520
Because we're old.

1483
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,520
No.

1484
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,520
Viv is a hag.

1485
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,520
Viv is a hag.

1486
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,520
Hags are in demand.

1487
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,520
Maybe not.

1488
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,520
Maybe other hags. I don't know about you.

1489
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,520
But it's all running in sync.

1490
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,520
I'm pretty proud of us.

1491
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,520
Why did you stop?

1492
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,520
I dropped something, but I don't know where it is.

1493
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,520
Is it this big rock?

1494
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,520
Is it my boobs?

1495
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,520
Is it your boobs?

1496
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,520
You drop your pocket.

1497
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,520
You will see me in Japan.

1498
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,520
My boobs, I'm pretty sure are bigger than yours.

1499
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:41,520
And they're softer than yours.

1500
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,520
My boobs are great.

1501
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,520
What the fuck?

1502
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,520
I don't know about that.

1503
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,520
You felt each other's boobs?

1504
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,520
How do you know they're so good?

1505
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:47,520
We're gonna.

1506
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,520
We're gonna.

1507
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,520
In October, we're gonna feel each other's boobs.

1508
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,520
Oh, you guys do an off collab in Japan?

1509
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,520
Yeah.

1510
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,520
No.

1511
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,520
Yeah.

1512
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,520
No.

1513
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,520
No.

1514
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,520
I wanna see her.

1515
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,520
You don't wanna see her?

1516
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,520
She's mean to me.

1517
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,520
You're kind of mean back though.

1518
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,520
Yeah.

1519
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,520
You're very soon.

1520
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,520
Yeah, here I am.

1521
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:08,520
She's made.

1522
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,520
She's made.

1523
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:14,520
But Pookie, you're my soulmate.

1524
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,520
No, we're twin flames because we're out.

1525
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,520
Nice callback.

1526
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,520
Love that.

1527
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,520
The underworld.

1528
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:26,520
Already off to a great start ladies.

1529
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,520
I thought we were taking the shortcut.

1530
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,520
I was like, because of her.

1531
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,520
We are.

1532
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,520
Oh, that shortcut.

1533
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,520
We're just not ready for it.

1534
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,520
Okay.

1535
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,520
Oh, I just assume.

1536
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:37,520
At least now when we fall off, we'll start back up here.

1537
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,520
Yeah.

1538
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,520
I think we lost a brain cell because of the piss talk.

1539
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,520
Probably.

1540
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,520
What were you guys talking about?

1541
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,520
We were talking about how long you were pissing and then we were just talking about pissing

1542
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,520
in general.

1543
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,520
We were talking about porta-potties and how we hate porta-potties.

1544
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,520
Yeah.

1545
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,520
Yeah.

1546
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,520
And how we over squat.

1547
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,520
Do you squat or do you bare ass a toilet?

1548
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,520
Or do you put a little liner down in me?

1549
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,520
It really depends.

1550
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,520
I never really squat though.

1551
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,520
If it's too dirty, I just don't go.

1552
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,520
Yeah.

1553
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,520
Exactly.

1554
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,520
But what if you have to?

1555
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,520
Then I'll piss on the fucking floor.

1556
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,520
Piss on the floor.

1557
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,520
I'm kidding.

1558
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,520
Piss in the middle of a Walmart.

1559
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,520
Did you guys see that TikTok of the girl that shot herself in Walmart?

1560
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,520
I stored there.

1561
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:22,520
What?

1562
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:29,520
She recorded a TikTok of her crying and she's like, guys, I just shot myself in Walmart.

1563
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,520
Of course it happens at a Walmart.

1564
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,520
It's always the Walmart.

1565
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,520
There's somebody who was like, I saw someone shit.

1566
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,520
Someone else made another TikTok.

1567
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,520
Guys, I just saw someone shit in the Walmart.

1568
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:52,520
I love it when there's like TikToks of multiple angles and stories of the same thing.

1569
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,520
Oh my God.

1570
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:01,520
I think the power of us talking about piss and shit is making us play really good.

1571
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,520
I know.

1572
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,520
We're not even thinking.

1573
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,520
We're just going.

1574
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,520
We're just so focused.

1575
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,520
We just turned our brain off.

1576
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,520
Yeah.

1577
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,520
More piss and shit talk.

1578
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,520
Oh, never mind.

1579
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,520
I think it's or because we're all old men.

1580
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,520
Maybe.

1581
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,520
Maybe it's the power of it.

1582
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,520
I don't know.

1583
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,520
I just fell off.

1584
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,520
I guess we really fell off.

1585
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,520
He didn't handle it.

1586
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,520
What did weight girls actually shit?

1587
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:27,520
Something.

1588
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,520
Something like that.

1589
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,520
We do something like the male equivalent, but it's not quite fitting.

1590
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:33,520
You know, like how owls like puke out the bones?

1591
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,520
That's kind of.

1592
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,520
Yeah.

1593
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,520
We grind stuff in our gizzard and then we throw it up.

1594
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,520
Yeah.

1595
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,520
That's basically what girls do.

1596
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,520
Oh, no.

1597
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:43,520
It's okay.

1598
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,520
It's okay.

1599
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,520
It's okay.

1600
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,520
Guys, we're good.

1601
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,520
We got this.

1602
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,520
Even if we fall off, we have the checkpoint stuff.

1603
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,520
So it's not a really big deal.

1604
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,520
We got it.

1605
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,520
Keep going to the side.

1606
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,520
Yeah.

1607
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,520
Go for it.

1608
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,520
Go for it.

1609
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,520
Everyone.

1610
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,520
Oh, I keep forgetting you can sprint.

1611
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,520
Sprint.

1612
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,520
Come on.

1613
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,520
Use your old man legs.

1614
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,520
Follow me.

1615
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,520
Pull me to victory.

1616
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,520
I'm getting held back by you.

1617
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,520
I'm seeing so proud of this bangle.

1618
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,520
I'm trying to go forward.

1619
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:20,520
I'm trying to go forward and she's just like not moving.

1620
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,520
Go our leader, our fearless leader.

1621
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:24,520
Me?

1622
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,520
Yeah.

1623
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,520
Yes.

1624
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:27,520
You're the fearless leader.

1625
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,520
Cute girls go first.

1626
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,520
Cute girls first.

1627
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,520
Me and Viv go last because we're hacks.

1628
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,520
Yeah, because we're old.

1629
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,520
I'm 56 years old.

1630
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:36,520
My birthday's coming up.

1631
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,520
I'm turning 57.

1632
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,520
Oh, damn.

1633
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,520
Nah, forever 56.

1634
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,520
You wear diapers?

1635
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,520
Uh, yeah.

1636
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,520
You sell those diapers?

1637
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,520
Do I sell them?

1638
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,520
You're talking, yeah.

1639
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,520
You only have two dollars.

1640
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,520
You can't afford them.

1641
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,520
Well, look, I can pay in other ways.

1642
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,520
Your body?

1643
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,520
Eyebrow.

1644
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,520
Yeah.

1645
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,520
Wait a second.

1646
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,520
Sorry.

1647
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,520
Sorry.

1648
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,520
Sorry.

1649
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,520
Sorry.

1650
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,520
I got distracted by our diaper talk.

1651
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:00,520
Yeah.

1652
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,520
I was wondering too.

1653
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,520
Yeah.

1654
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,520
I mean, I can sell you like a liver.

1655
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,520
Like, do you sell them on eBay?

1656
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:07,520
I can do that.

1657
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,520
A liver.

1658
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:12,520
I like to make the likes of art with the remnants of what's inside.

1659
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,520
I feel like Etsy.

1660
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,520
Yeah.

1661
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:15,520
Etsy.

1662
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,520
Is this against your terms of service?

1663
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,520
No.

1664
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,520
As long as you don't stay.

1665
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,520
That's why we keep it on the DL.

1666
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,520
It's a secret operation.

1667
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,520
Secret biohazard.

1668
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,520
That's what the store is called.

1669
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,520
How did you know?

1670
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,520
Oh, yeah.

1671
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:29,520
Secret biohazard.

1672
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,520
What's up?

1673
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,520
What's up?

1674
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,520
Okay.

1675
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:35,520
You know, the old men.

1676
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,520
We're quadruplets.

1677
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:37,520
I know.

1678
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,520
They call us the retirement home.

1679
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,520
Okay.

1680
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,520
Soppy, you're a son of a bitch.

1681
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,520
Sorry, mom.

1682
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,520
Wait.

1683
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,520
Oops.

1684
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,520
We were ready.

1685
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,520
Apparently we were ready.

1686
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,520
Sorry.

1687
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:49,520
We did the time.

1688
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,520
We weren't going to make it though.

1689
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:52,520
I did it the time.

1690
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,520
Pick it up.

1691
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,520
Help me.

1692
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,520
Okay.

1693
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,520
No, no, no.

1694
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,520
I'm ready.

1695
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,520
I'm ready.

1696
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,520
I'm ready.

1697
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:00,520
Yeah.

1698
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,520
Yeah.

1699
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,520
Yeah.

1700
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,520
Yeah.

1701
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:04,520
Go.

1702
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,520
Okay.

1703
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,520
We were in sync on that one.

1704
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,520
Nice.

1705
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,520
That was pretty good.

1706
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,520
Okay.

1707
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,520
This one, this one, this one.

1708
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:11,520
I don't think we can count down this one.

1709
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,520
I think we got to just say this one.

1710
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:13,520
This one, this one, this one.

1711
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,520
This one.

1712
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:15,520
Go.

1713
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,520
Send it.

1714
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,520
Remember, you can sprint.

1715
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,520
Yes.

1716
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,520
Okay.

1717
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,520
You've played.

1718
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,520
I'm so proud of us.

1719
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,520
Oh, there's only three.

1720
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,520
Oh, no, we're doing.

1721
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,520
Wait, why did I just fall off?

1722
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,520
Can I sprint up the ladder?

1723
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,520
Timer?

1724
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,520
No.

1725
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:33,520
That's just how much time has taken us so far.

1726
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,520
Only six minutes.

1727
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:35,520
Yeah.

1728
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:36,520
It's not bad.

1729
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,520
Those people probably speed run this.

1730
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,520
Yeah.

1731
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,520
Probably.

1732
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,520
I didn't even notice.

1733
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,520
Oh, yeah.

1734
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,520
We're speed running this.

1735
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,520
Wait, let me hide.

1736
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,520
Wait, can you guys wait?

1737
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,520
This game is actually really long.

1738
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:47,520
Are you ready?

1739
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,520
Can you guys pause real quick?

1740
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,520
Yeah.

1741
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,520
Let me turn and move my stuff so they can see how.

1742
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:55,520
Why are you?

1743
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:58,520
Look how it was posted.

1744
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,520
Are you like that?

1745
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:01,520
The spread eagle.

1746
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,520
Yeah, I'm giving you a show.

1747
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,520
Oh, the spread.

1748
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,520
Do you guys ever watch Chicago?

1749
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:09,520
No.

1750
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:10,520
Chicago.

1751
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,520
Wait, is it ready?

1752
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,520
No.

1753
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:17,520
It's the one where it's like snow block tango.

1754
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,520
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1755
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,520
I know that.

1756
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:24,520
And then they're like her like sister and her husband were doing the spread eagle.

1757
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,520
Ready?

1758
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,520
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1759
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:34,520
I know you should describe it more in detail though.

1760
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:38,520
I just always thought spread eagles and your legs are just like in the air like spread.

1761
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,520
I don't know what it is.

1762
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,520
No, no, no, it is what it is.

1763
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,520
But that was like also the hell I'm stuck behind the ladder.

1764
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,520
Don't worry.

1765
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,520
We'll pull you up.

1766
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,520
I keep getting stuck on stuff.

1767
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,520
Okay, we'll pull you up.

1768
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,520
Thank you.

1769
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:51,520
It was so nice.

1770
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,520
I'm not having to be at the end.

1771
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,520
I will jump off right now.

1772
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,520
Do not test me.

1773
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,520
Well, if you do it, do it.

1774
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,520
Do it.

1775
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,520
Do it.

1776
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,520
Jump.

1777
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,520
Wow.

1778
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,520
I'm so edgy.

1779
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,520
I'm acting.

1780
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:05,520
Do it.

1781
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,520
It's like your toddler proof stuffy.

1782
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,520
Okay.

1783
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,520
Amazing timing.

1784
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,520
Okay.

1785
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,520
No.

1786
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,520
Okay.

1787
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,520
Oh, look at that.

1788
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:21,520
I'm like, oh, we all just waited.

1789
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,520
We're not that dumb.

1790
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,520
We still got six brain cells.

1791
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:27,520
Wait.

1792
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:36,520
We lost you because we missed the number the first time and then we talked about this.

1793
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,520
Oh, my game is lagging.

1794
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,520
Oh, pause.

1795
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,520
Let me fix your game.

1796
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,520
Pause, pause, pause.

1797
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,520
Pause.

1798
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,520
I'm good.

1799
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,520
I'm good.

1800
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,520
You're on a diet.

1801
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,520
Stop.

1802
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,520
Okay.

1803
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,520
Okay.

1804
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,520
I'm feeling chaotic.

1805
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,520
Go, go, go, go.

1806
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:54,520
This actually works out.

1807
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,520
Oh, my God.

1808
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:58,520
That's fine.

1809
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,520
I was dangled off the side.

1810
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:01,520
Okay.

1811
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,520
Okay.

1812
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,520
It works out.

1813
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,520
Okay.

1814
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:08,520
Because if you like kind of like do the balancing and like two people are on one side and two

1815
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:11,520
people are on the other, you can kind of get under some of the obstacles.

1816
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,520
Oh, I didn't mean to fall off.

1817
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,520
Sorry.

1818
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,520
All right.

1819
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,520
Ready?

1820
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,520
Go.

1821
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,520
I guess.

1822
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,520
I guess.

1823
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,520
Around you.

1824
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,520
Where am I going?

1825
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,520
I can't tell which one's me anymore.

1826
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:23,520
Okay.

1827
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,520
Let's go.

1828
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,520
Hag Squad is this way.

1829
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,520
That's right.

1830
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,520
We go up here.

1831
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:28,520
Hag Squad.

1832
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,520
Hag Squad.

1833
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,520
Wait.

1834
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:33,520
What's the what's the what's the Hag what's the male version of Hag?

1835
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,520
Just old man.

1836
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,520
Oh, Jesus.

1837
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,520
Oh, Jesus.

1838
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,520

Okay.

Hag Squad.

1845
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,520
Let's go.

1846
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,520
Hag Squad.

1847
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:46,520
Teresa Squad.

1848
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,520
Oh.

1849
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,520
Oh, Jesus.

1850
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:51,520
Oh, Jesus.

1851
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,520
Oh, Jesus.

There you go.

1856
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,520
I wasn't looking at us.

1857
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,520
It's already.

1858
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,520
Don't go yet.

1859
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:00,520
Don't go yet.

1860
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:01,520
No.

1861
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,520
I'm so sorry.

1862
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:03,520
No, I'm sorry.

1863
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,520
You are a run ahead and then jump.

1864
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,520
It's fine.

1865
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,520
Just press the button, press the button.

1866
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,520
Is that so much better?

1867
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000

Yeah, you're right. You're right

1886
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:58,040
I don't have a driver's license. I don't know if I mean, this is your training right here. Yeah, this is this is the this is the

How do I turn?

1891

You did it. You got it. You got it. You got this. Oh, I have to be moving forward to turn. Yeah, yep

1892
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,960
Okay, okay. Yeah, you're making fun of me in my driving

1893
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,080
See how it is harder than it looks

1894
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,480
Oh boy

1895
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:28,280
Okay, but I won't be running into every single one of these

1896
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,680
excuse

1897
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,240
We'll see you say one

1898
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:38,920
I won't I won't not every single one you got to go faster to avoid them. They actually don't really knock you off

1899
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,920
They kind of just bop you

1900
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,920
Oh nice

1901
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,920
Stay in your seat

1902
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,440
Maybe it's because we're on easy mode

1903
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,080
Even on easy mode you can fall off

1904
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,960
Okay

1905
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,960
We made it

1906
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,400
We made it

1907
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,400
Thanks, OG Sonny

1908
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,400
Thanks, OG Sonny, did that

1909
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,400
You're very welcome

1910
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,960
I think you got your garbage license on that one

1911
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:41,400
And jump and jump again

1912
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:43,400
And we jump again

1913
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,400
And then we're dead

1914
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,400
I'm not gonna link it

1915
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:51,800
Oh, it's okay. We can drive back. Oh, okay. Sopralto, wait

1916
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,720
Oh, no, we don't need you

1917
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:56,840
No, I won't

1918
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,840
It's really funny if Sopralto freaking

1919
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:04,680
I'll jump right now. Let's go do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Come on. Wait. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Let's do it

1920
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,680
Yeah, you can do it

1921
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,120
This is gonna be all on come on sloppy hands

1922
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:12,920
Okay

1923
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:16,520
Oh, you're going fast. Okay. Oh, she's doing okay

1924
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,520
Oh, he's Mario Kart

1925
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,520
Mario Kart? Kill him

1926
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,520
Don't actually kill him

1927
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:33,400
Okay, nice. Okay, keep going. Oh, she's driving backwards. That's a deal

1928
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,040
I'm trying to figure out how to reverse

1929
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,360
Yeah

1930
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,360
There you go. Point turn

1931
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,360
Yeah

1932
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,080
That was almost as good as the board

1933
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:49,480
Oh, don't make me laugh. I'm gonna make Mrs. Sopralto

1934
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:52,680
Yeah, you got this. Probably we're gonna mess it up anyways, but yeah

1935
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,320
No, we're gonna have pain

1936
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,120
You know, maybe guinea pigs shouldn't drive

1937
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:04,280
No, you're doing it. If you just go over it, baby

1938
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,280
She's doing it. She's doing it

1939
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:10,680
You're not going backwards. Are you threatening to kill us? What's happening?

1940
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,080
Yes

1941
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:18,760
I don't think I want to be a passenger princess anymore

1942
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,720
Oh my god

1943
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:37,080
It's okay. We're back here. We're still on the road. We're starting backwards. How do I turn around?

1944
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:40,440
Oh

1945
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:51,640
No, you can't do this. I believe in you. Oh my god. Just drive backwards. Just drive backwards. Yeah, just drive backwards. Yeah

1946
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,640
Just stay backwards. I can't see

1947
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,240
Turn your camera

1948
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:01,560
Wait, I got it. Wait, I could use the ramp to help me. Oh my god

1949
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,800

Oh

1955
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:21,560
I can't believe this is happening again

1956
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,240
Okay, if you got this don't run into these things

1957
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,920
Baby pull this back

1958
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,680
All right, now we know where that was gonna go. Yeah

1959
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,680
Oh

1960
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:58,280
I wish they had like little dances like a little fortnight like I could eat about

1961
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:06,120
Justice here. Exactly. This is me dancing. Oh my god. I'm laughing again. So hard that I like a little bit of a

1962
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,120
Chocolate

1963
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,960
This is not a good dance

1964
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,800
Maybe if we were talking about piss, I would have done better. You ever saw that guy?

1965
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,520
Okay, okay. What's your favorite flavor of piss?

1966
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,720
apple red

1967
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,720
Oh

1968
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,160
I could drive again

1969
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:39,800
Did she be good in the front? Oh, who's in the front right now?

1970
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:43,480
Okay, okay. Thank goodness. Thank goodness

1971
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:51,560
Wait, why am I going backwards? I'm in the front. You are? What? Yeah. Oh, I thought I was driving

1972
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:58,680
Wait, who's driving me? Are you really? Are you serious? I was like, wait, that can't be me

1973
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,400
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah

1974
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,200
Yeah, that's Soppy

1975
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:11,320
I've never gotten pulled over and I have a really good license just not in hell

1976
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:16,520
You know, I don't know if that's true. I think you're lying to us

1977
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:22,280
I think you're like driver's license is fake. Did you die in a car crash? Is that how you got to hell?

1978
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:26,040
Because she crashed a car. She had like 50 pedestrians

1979
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:29,640
She crashed during her training

1980
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,640
Go

1981
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,200
All right my turn

1982
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,200
Okay

1983
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,160
I like how entertained we are by this car

1984
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,760
We just want to see everyone's driving

1985
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:11,720
I wish I could jump and do flips. Can I go faster? No, this is the max you can go

1986
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:18,280
Okay, okay, you're doing really good. I'm not sucking it off

1987
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,080
It's it's because you're just a bad driver, babe

1988
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,800
Yippie

1989
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,480
Sorry pretty sold

1990
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,480
You're just a bad driver proceeds to get out of the car

1991
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:36,440
Well, getting off the car is a lot better than driving off the

1992
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,840
You saw me so bad

1993
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,800
There's no way I was doing pretty good

1994
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:54,120
I was going no stop. Okay made it to the end somebody's a decent driver here, you know, not you

1995
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:56,920
Not definitely not you

1996
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:02,040
Oh, wait, are the chains real? I thought the chains were like

1997
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:10,840
They do get stuck on some things but some things they don't get stuck on these like the thin things you can get past

1998
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,320
Okay, okay

1999
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:19,480
Please stay on the cube this time. I'm ready to throw myself off the cube. Okay, he's gonna spin. Okay

2000
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:22,520

I'm on the cube. I am no longer on the cube stay on the cube. I'm on the cube

01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:42,920
Okay, it just sounds fun only the main character. So now I'll respond like right here. So it's fine

2006
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,560
The entire time you're not a main character

2007
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:49,320
I was on the cube though. You're like a side character

2008
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:52,440
You're the one that dies on episode three

2009
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,840
Oh my god, and you motivate

2010

Oh, I can see my insides. I did not like that. You can see your insides

2031
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:47,640
I like it like clipped so that I could see my inside of my model. It was kind of

Oh, why are we counting down? I didn't mean to hit that. Oh, okay. I can see inside my pants

01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:01,640
Oh, it looks like guts and stuff is through the chain. Yeah

I don't want to make those noises

2047
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,120
I don't think I'll ever live these noises down if I make them

2048
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:37,160
Why not that bad? I mean, they'll be in private me and you and maybe a few other people

Oh, the only driving that was majestic was mine. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. I see how it is. I'm just chopped a liver

01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:33,000
Go go get to the another elevator another elevator. Oh

2105
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:36,840
Cute

2106
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,920
Oh

2107
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,800
Oh, we have a nice ass

2108
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:54,200
Okay, thank you elevator very safely. I think just walk on it. I didn't know you could like fall off of it

2109
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,200
We did it gang

2110
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:04,760
Let's fit in the chains now. There we go. It's so funny

2111
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,920
Oh

2112
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:16,600
Welcome to the wisdom whispering. Oh, wow. I got an achievement. We too reach the mysterious cave

2113
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:23,640
You guys want to explore feel free. There's nothing but go ahead. No, I'm good

2114
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:29,960
Don't worry. No, the elevator is very safe. Oh water

2115
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:35,720
Well, uh, okay, so be careful because there might be a spot where you can fall through are we naked?

2116
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:38,280
No, no

2117
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:40,040
It looks like we're naked

2118
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:42,040
Wait. Oh, you can dive

2119
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:44,120
Oh, do we do we drown?

2120
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:48,040
No, no, I think we're already dead. So we can't double dive

2121
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:51,960
True, true, true. Oh wait. No, I don't think we're at that water spot yet

2122
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:55,640
Where you have to like swim around all around maze

2123
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,520
I'm running

2124
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:07,640
Yeah, they should do that. They should add like a monster that chases you so it's like scarier and hardly hard mode. Yeah

2125
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:13,080
Very safe

2126
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:15,960
Super funny what you guys look like when you look up

2127
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:20,440
Oh, wait, our heads actually turn. Oh, yeah

2128
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:26,040
Okay, so this is a puzzle

2129
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:28,600
Did you say a puzzle? Why are you serious?

2130
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:32,280
It's a puzzle. Okay, guys. We have to jump and we have to hit the buttons

2131
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:35,400
Six brain cells. We got this

2132
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:39,080
16 cells. We have to hit them all. Yes

2133
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:42,120
In order to open the door

2134
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:46,120
Where's the next one?

2135
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Oh

2136
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:57,960
I can't remember if they're timed or not. Where's the last button? It's over here

2137
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:03,240
Where I am I'm in I'm in such rock. Help me

2138
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:09,560
Oh, I can't get up. Where's the last button? It's right behind you. I'm here. What?

2139
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:12,360
I'm here. Oh

2140
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:14,360
Sorry, miss. Oh

2141
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:16,760
We did it. Nice. We did it

2142
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:21,160
That puzzle was nothing. Yeah easy easy

2143
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:27,480
Okay, now we gotta make that that sprint and jump sprint jump grab

2144
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:31,560
Hey you saved me, okay

2145
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:34,600
Um, maybe not yet. Huh?

2146
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:35,960
From the side

2147
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:36,840
Go

2148
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:37,880
I'm going. Oh no

2149
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:40,440
Okay, okay. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good

2150
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:41,720
We'll make it

2151
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:43,720
Okay, wait, wait here

2152
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:46,040
Go down. Go down. Go down. Go down. Go down. Go down

2153
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,480
Oh, goodbye

2154
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:48,600
Oh

2155
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:49,660
Wait no

2156
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:55,640
Oh, not the oh, hey look we're back to the car

2157
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:57,280
Absolutely not.

2158
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:58,600
It means hell.

2159
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,600
It's me driving that car again.

2160
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:03,600
Uh-oh.

2161
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,600
I was ready for this.

2162
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:08,600
What's happening to you?

2163
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:09,600
OK, there we go.

2164
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:10,600
It's OK.

2165
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:11,600
It's OK.

2166
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:12,600
We'll just drag you across.

2167
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:13,600
Wait, wait, wait.

2168
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:14,600
No, just drag me.

2169
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:15,600
Just drag me.

2170
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:16,600
It's OK.

2171
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:17,600
I'm stuck.

2172
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:18,600
It's OK.

2173
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:19,600
I'm a fairy.

2174
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,600
She was a fairy.

2175
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,600
She was a fairy.

2176
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,560
Whee.

2177
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:27,560
Hi, Sophie.

2178
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:28,560
Ah!

2179
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:29,560
No!

2180
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:30,560
Oh!

2181
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:33,560
Back to the car.

2182
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:34,560
You win this car.

2183
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,560
You were obsessed with this car.

2184
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:36,560
You just want to drive again.

2185
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:37,560
No.

2186
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:38,560
I think I just like...

2187
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,560
She's not allowed to drive a little on the inside.

2188
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:41,560
Oh my god.

2189
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:44,560
You know, I have a very nice car.

2190
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:45,560
That you don't use.

2191
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:48,560
It's a mom van.

2192
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,560
You're calling me to give the hag?

2193
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:53,560
Probably has zero miles on it, too.

2194
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:55,520
This is like $25,000.

2195
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:56,520
Miles?

2196
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:57,520
That's pretty good.

2197
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:58,520
I actually don't know what that...

2198
01:44:58,520 --> 01:44:59,520
Fuck.

2199
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:00,520
Oh.

2200
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:03,520
It's how many...

2201
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:07,520
It's just how much you've used your car.

2202
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:10,520
But also, my parents gave it to me,

2203
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:12,520
so I could go to college.

2204
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:14,520
To get more knowledge?

2205
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:16,520
Go to college.

2206
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:18,520
Yes.

2207
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:20,520
And then I chose to become a streamer,

2208
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:22,520
so you see where I'm happening.

2209
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:25,480
Oh, that's okay.

2210
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:27,480
Oh, gosh.

2211
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:32,480
This is where me, Azura, Apollo, and Freya got stuck on

2212
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:34,480
really hard core last time,

2213
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:36,480
and we were raging by the end of the week.

2214
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:38,480
Right here, right here, yeah.

2215
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,480
He's got to be mindful of the lasers.

2216
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:42,480
Demure, very demure, very mindful.

2217
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:43,480
Okay, be ready to jump.

2218
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:45,480
I'm always mindful.

2219
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:46,480
Okay.

2220
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:47,480
And then where?

2221
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:49,480
Oh, and then right here, too.

2222
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:52,480
Turn to the side, and then go over there.

2223
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:54,440
We're so good at this.

2224
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:55,440
Yeah.

2225
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,440
Wait, let us finish this first.

2226
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:59,440
I mean, look at us go.

2227
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,440
Where do we go next?

2228
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:02,440
That one?

2229
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:03,440
Oh, okay.

2230
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:04,440
Our massive brain.

2231
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:06,440
We're actually doing a lot better

2232
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:08,440
when I played this last, holy crap.

2233
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:10,440
It's the piss buff.

2234
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:12,440
It's the piss buff, yeah.

2235
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:14,440
The pee pee and the poo poo buff.

2236
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:16,440
Oh, sorry, I jumped too hard.

2237
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:18,440
Sorry, I jumped too soon.

2238
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:20,440
Oh, my God, I'm spazzing out.

2239
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:22,400
Oh, my God.

2240
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,400
Oh, my God, this game's breaking me.

2241
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,400
Almost there, almost there.

2242
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,400
Okay, we got it, we got it.

2243
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,400
We're almost backed up so far.

2244
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:31,400
I fell off.

2245
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:32,400
Okay.

2246
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:33,400
We did it.

2247
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:35,400
You guys couldn't do that?

2248
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:36,400
Yeah, we couldn't.

2249
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:37,400
For some reason.

2250
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,400
They didn't have the joint chemistry that we do.

2251
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:41,400
Our brain cells are weak.

2252
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:43,400
I think it was this one, actually, though.

2253
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:46,400
When you fall, you have to start back.

2254
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,400
It's okay, we got the button.

2255
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,400
We got the button.

2256
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,360
You have to start back at them.

2257
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:54,360
That's okay, we're good, we're good.

2258
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:56,360
We're good, we're good.

2259
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:58,360
I believe in level, technically.

2260
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:00,360
I believe in the highest point.

2261
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:02,360
How long have we been doing this?

2262
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:03,360
1.47.

2263
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:04,360
1.45?

2264
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:05,360
Wow, okay.

2265
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:06,360
Oh, sorry, I rounded it.

2266
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:08,360
I'm sorry, I rounded it.

2267
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:09,360
1.45?

2268
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:11,360
1.47 is close enough.

2269
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:13,360
You rounded it.

2270
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,360
I don't like that.

2271
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:17,360
Ready, jump.

2272
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,360
I missed.

2273
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:23,320
Oh, we were about to fall perfectly in that hole over there.

2274
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:27,320
I fell perfectly in your hole last night.

2275
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:30,320
I fell perfectly in your mom's hole last night.

2276
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:32,320
I wasn't going to say that.

2277
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,320
I wasn't going to say that, but I didn't want to be your mom into this.

2278
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,320
And now I see that we're allowed to.

2279
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,320
Of course we are.

2280
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:39,320
Mom's fair game.

2281
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:41,320
That's what she told me last night.

2282
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:47,320
Me and Amy started the same two brain cells, apparently.

2283
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:48,320
Ready?

2284
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:49,320
Yes.

2285
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:50,320
Okay, don't miss.

2286
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:51,320
Jump.

2287
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:53,320
I didn't even get to jump.

2288
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:55,320
I like someone fell into it.

2289
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:56,320
Who was it?

2290
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:58,320
I jumped on top of it, I'm sorry.

2291
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,320
It's okay, I can't be mad at you.

2292
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:02,320
If it was Sobby, I would have been pissed.

2293
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:04,320
I'm going to jump off the map right now.

2294
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,320
Don't test me.

2295
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,320
Do it.

2296
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:09,320
I'll pee in your fucking suit.

2297
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:13,320
Don't test me.

2298
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,320
I know where you live.

2299
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:17,320
You see what I have to do?

2300
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,320
Is that mean or me defending myself?

2301
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:21,320
It's kind of hot.

2302
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:22,320
You guys should kiss.

2303
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:23,320
We are.

2304
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:24,320
We're going to hold toes.

2305
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:26,320
Our toes are going to interlock toes.

2306
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:27,320
Interlock toes.

2307
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:30,320
I don't know.

2308
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:31,320
Crazy thing.

2309
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:33,320
I actually don't like people touching my feet.

2310
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:34,320
Really?

2311
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,320
Same.

2312
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:37,320
You never had your toes sucked?

2313
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:38,320
Oh my God.

2314
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,320
You haven't had me touch your feet, okay?

2315
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,320
You don't know what it's like.

2316
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:46,320
One time I went to get a massage and I told the lady not to touch my feet.

2317
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,320
Because I felt weird about it.

2318
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,320
I just don't like people touching my feet.

2319
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:53,320
I don't know.

2320
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:54,320
I've just been a thing.

2321
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:55,320
Do you get ticklish?

2322
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:56,320
No, no.

2323
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:57,320
I just don't like.

2324
01:48:57,320 --> 01:48:58,320
I just don't like.

2325
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:59,320
Go, go, go, go.

2326
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:02,320
The only time I'll have people touch my feet is my pedicurist.

2327
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:05,320
And I'll giggle every time and she makes fun of me.

2328
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,320
Oh, so you're ticklish?

2329
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:08,320
I'm extremely ticklish on my feet.

2330
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,320
Well, you just gave us ammo.

2331
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,320
What are you going to do with that ammo?

2332
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:15,320
What are you going to do with that ammo?

2333
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:18,320
Tickle the feet.

2334
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:19,320
Come on, Chibi.

2335
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:20,320
You got this.

2336
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:21,320
Come on, Chibi.

2337
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:22,320
Come on, Chibi.

2338
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:23,320
I'm trying so hard.

2339
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:24,320
Chibi.

2340
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,320
You got it.

2341
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:26,320
You got it.

2342
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:27,320
I'm trying.

2343
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:28,320
You got it.

2344
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:29,320
I'm trying to pull up.

2345
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:30,320
I'm trying to pull up.

2346
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:31,320
Chibi.

2347
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:33,320
You saw me pulling it up.

2348
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:34,320
You saw me.

2349
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:35,320
You almost got it.

2350
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:36,320
You almost got it.

2351
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,320
I stopped his fault.

2352
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,320
It was stopped his fault.

2353
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:39,320
I literally, okay, you know what?

2354
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:40,320
I'm not going to fall next time.

2355
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:41,320
It's all your fault.

2356
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:43,320
I literally can't move.

2357
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:44,320
I'm sorry.

2358
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,320
I didn't know where you were going.

2359
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,320
I was turning on the light and starting my house.

2360
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:51,320
Chibi, you're in the air.

2361
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:52,320
I'm trying to pull.

2362
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:53,320
Oh, my God.

2363
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:54,320
I can't pull both.

2364
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:55,320
Oh, my God.

2365
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:56,320
Oh, man, it worked out.

2366
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:57,320
Oh, shit.

2367
01:49:57,320 --> 01:49:58,320
What was that?

2368
01:49:58,320 --> 01:49:59,320
It's the dangle tech.

2369
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:01,320
If we're dangling, we can't get pushed off.

2370
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:02,320
Don't worry about it.

2371
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:03,320
Just keep going.

2372
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:04,320
Okay.

2373
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:05,320
Well, at least you're going.

2374
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:06,320
But there's spikes.

2375
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:07,320
That's okay.

2376
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:08,320
I'll be fine.

2377
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,320
Aren't they going to spike us?

2378
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:10,320
Wait.

2379
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:11,320
If we jump.

2380
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:12,320
We're back at the beginning.

2381
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,320
I cannot jump.

2382
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:15,320
Flicker.

2383
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:17,320
Oh, back to the car.

2384
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:19,320
Oh, my God.

2385
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:22,320
Back to the car.

2386
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:25,320
I'm going to put a bomb in your car.

2387
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:26,320
Okay.

2388
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,320
The next person who falls gets their toes sucked.

2389
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:29,320
Oh, my God.

2390
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:30,320
Okay.

2391
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:31,320
Ready?

2392
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:32,320
Yes.

2393
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:33,320
The next person who falls, what?

2394
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:35,320
They get their toes sucked.

2395
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:36,320
They did.

2396
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:37,320
Not by Mimi.

2397
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:38,320
My reward.

2398
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:39,320
My reward?

2399
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:49,320
Was I supposed to be a reward?

2400
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:53,320
I know, like, ticklishness is a fetish.

2401
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:55,320
You don't like ticklishness as a fetish?

2402
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:56,320
Wait, wait, wait.

2403
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:59,320
Yeah, like, I know some people get off from being, like, tickled.

2404
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:00,320
What?

2405
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:01,320
Yeah.

2406
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:02,320
Yeah.

2407
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:03,320
It's a thing.

2408
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:04,320
It's a thing.

2409
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:05,320
For sure.

2410
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:07,320
I didn't even know that.

2411
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:09,320
I mean, everything's a fetish to really think about it.

2412
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:10,320
I don't think the point of sexual psychology

2413
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:13,320
is to teach you about every single kink that exists.

2414
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:14,320
No, no, no.

2415
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:15,320
I did learn that there's a difference between a kink

2416
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:16,320
and a fetish.

2417
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:17,320
Oh, wait.

2418
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:18,320
What's the difference?

2419
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:19,320
Oh.

2420
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:23,320
A kink is something that amplifies the do, you know?

2421
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:24,320
OK.

2422
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:27,320
And then a fetish is something like you genuinely need to get off.

2423
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:28,320
Oh.

2424
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,320
Oh.

2425
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:32,320
So Warwick for me.

2426
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:33,320
Yes.

2427
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:34,320
It's a fetish.

2428
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:35,320
OK.

2429
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:36,320
Wait, what's Warwick?

2430
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:37,320
A league.

2431
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:38,320
Don't get into it.

2432
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:40,320
Have you ever heard of the best game ever, League of Legends?

2433
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:41,320
Oh, god.

2434
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:42,320
I'm going to kill myself right now.

2435
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:44,320
I'm going to throw myself off.

2436
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:49,320
With over 150 characters you could play?

2437
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:50,320
No.

2438
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:51,320
It's OK.

2439
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:53,320
You don't have to tell me about it.

2440
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:54,320
Oh.

2441
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:55,320
OK.

2442
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:56,320
No!

2443
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:57,320
Stop it.

2444
01:51:57,320 --> 01:51:58,320
Stop it.

2445
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,320
That's on me.

2446
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:00,320
No, no.

2447
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:01,320
That's Shibi.

2448
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:02,320
That's Shibi.

2449
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:03,320
That's not me this time.

2450
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:04,320
That's Shibi.

2451
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:05,320
Or is that me this time?

2452
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:08,320
I'll have you know, and you'll have me this time.

2453
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:09,320
Ah!

2454
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:10,320
Jump!

2455
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:11,320
Jump!

2456
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:12,320
I feel like…

2457
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:13,320
Hey, we actually made it.

2458
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:17,320
We got our two dogs at the park, and we're just holding them back.

2459
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:18,320
I have to toot.

2460
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:19,320
Do it.

2461
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:20,320
Turn around.

2462
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:21,320
Put it in, like, right in my head.

2463
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:22,320

02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:14,080

02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:10,960
I accidentally hit my mic

02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:15,920
I'll tap forward right away

2644
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:19,520
Really, why do you make it sound like I give up? I'm not a giver of her

2645
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:24,400
All right, I gotta go. I really don't want to but I gotta go spend time with

2648
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:37,200
That was fun

2649
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:41,200
It's like we had a podcast as we're like in hell

We're all still here in the room

2657
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:13,600

2659
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:21,200
Ah

02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:25,200
Oh, shit. Uh, no Sophie. Sophie's the only one left

02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:46,400
Let's go check out share. Okay. Bye Sophie here. Mwah. Okay

2662
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:49,200
Oh, how do I leave?

2663
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:52,560
Quit to laugh. There we go

2664
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:57,200
All right, I'm gonna go to just chatting

2665
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:06,400
All right, hi I was crying the whole time. Um

2666
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:10,400
Um, okay

2667
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:13,440
I had to turn off my crying

2668
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:19,360
There we go

2669
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:26,560
I was laughing so hard I was laughing too

2670
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:32,400
I'm a little bit worried that the stream was like hella blurry though because that game is like kind of realistic looking

2671
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:37,920
You're really good at this. I'm impressed. Oh, thank you

2672
02:07:38,640 --> 02:07:40,640
Honestly, I did better than I expected

2673
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:44,960
I guess I didn't really have any expectations going in

2674
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:50,000
Why is this virtual camera on I didn't really have too many expectations going in but

2675
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:52,880
I did do pretty okay

2676
02:07:53,840 --> 02:08:00,320
Pretty pretty not have bad not have bad for not being a gamer. Oh my god. The game was so blurry. Are you kidding me?

2677
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:08,400
Man, I'm trying to figure out how to stream with like not having a blurry game

2678
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:11,520
But I think I don't know if it's possible for all games

2679
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:13,520
It

2680
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:23,040
I'll ask she be later. I don't know pretty okay. You took them into your backpack

2681
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:29,680
The game wasn't blurry for me if you're on a phone, maybe it wasn't too blurry, but if you're on pc you're like

2682
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:32,800
Oh my god, do I need glasses?

2683
02:08:33,680 --> 02:08:38,960
Anyway, it's fine. I'm just a little bit of a perfectionist when it comes to that sort of stuff

2684
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:42,720
Is she be still streaming? Oh, she's talking

2685
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:49,520
She be it has to go because she has a member stream. She was doing three times today. Can you believe that?

2686
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:52,560
She basically streamed all day

2687
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:55,440
I don't have the energy for that

2688
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:59,200
Uh, oh i'm in the game alone save and quit quit

2689
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:03,760
Also while I was playing I had opened my bedroom door

2690
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:08,000
Um because it gets really hot in my bedroom

2691
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:14,080
And I had the I had my apartment door open because it gets really hot in my apartment

2692
02:09:14,640 --> 02:09:17,760
And fucking my rats escaped my bedroom. I forgot that they were out

2693
02:09:18,160 --> 02:09:20,560
In fact, I'm gonna try to put them back in the cage right now. Hold on

2694
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:47,200
If I can if I can get the other one in I might be able to like yap a little more

2695
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:50,160
Because I can leave my door open

2696
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:54,400
But like they literally could have just left and gone outside if they wanted to

2697
02:09:55,680 --> 02:09:58,800
If they wanted to they could have just gone outside. I had the door open

2698
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:06,880
They could have been free rats. I'm trying to look around for them. Well, there's only one left this system

2699
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:11,360
I think the only one left is pixie

2700
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:18,160
Oh, she be rated yay. Oh fuck. Is her name yay or yay?

2701
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:21,280
Oh, I'm guessing it's yay

2702
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:23,600
Oh, I'm so sorry

2703
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:26,800
Bro, she's got amazing tits though

2704
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:32,080
One second, sorry. I'm like walking around

2705
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:35,440
um

2706
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:44,160
All these jack-o-lanterns reminding me of halloweep season starting it is starting soon, but for us it's always halloween season

2707
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:48,480
They know they have it good no reason to leave true

2708
02:10:48,640 --> 02:10:52,880
I mean, they did leave my my room, but they didn't leave my um, I should turn the background music on

2709
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:55,680
They left my room, but they didn't leave my apartment

2710
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:58,400
Which they could have if they wanted to I guess

2711
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:00,560
but

2712
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:02,560
They're really scared leaving my room in general

2713
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:04,400
So for Dennis

2714
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:10,320
Day by day we approach closer to spooky season. Yeah, I'm really excited for spooky season. We have some fun stuff

2715
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:12,960
planned for spooky season

2716
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:16,640
I'm just watching yeah, I stream now

2717
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:19,600
Ah

2718
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:32,960
That's generally don't like new things or environments. That's true. They're they're kind of scaredy cats

2719
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:38,880
And if I can get my last ratty in the cage

2720
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:43,360
Let me see if she's under my bed hold on

2721
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:48,640
Oh

2722
02:12:17,200 --> 02:12:24,720
That's where she's not under my bed. I don't know where she could be there's not a lot of hiding places in my room anymore

2723
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:33,280
I used to have a closet I used to have two closets in my room one like the apartment came with like a

2724
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,320
Like a closet built into the bedroom, but it's so so tiny that like

2725
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:41,520
like you can't even walk into the closet basically like

2726
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:45,360
Because it's so small right it's not a walk-in closet, but it's also like

2727
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:50,320
You can't you can't go into the closet and then close the door behind you. It's so tiny

2728
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:52,080
um

2729
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:54,080
So I was like let me get an external closet

2730
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:58,560
And then when I had that external closet bro, the rats made it their freaking home

2731
02:12:59,200 --> 02:13:02,080
That closet belonged to the rats. It was the rats closet

2732
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:07,520
And I got rid of it simply because they kept going in there and just like fucking it up

2733
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:10,640
Chewing on my clothes, pissing on my clothes

2734
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:14,960
Bringing their toys in there bringing random shit in there toilet paper

2735
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
I don't know what other stuff bedding

2736
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:21,680
So I had to get rid of it and now there's nowhere for them to hide

2737
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:25,440
Immediately made a tom and jerry mouse hole

2738
02:13:32,240 --> 02:13:35,360
What do you mean my rats it's a rat hunt it is

2739
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:44,960
Can rats has a little cheeseburger as a treat no

2740
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:51,760
No, I mean sometimes when I eat fast food I give them leftovers, but usually I don't

2741
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:59,360
Usually I don't

2742
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:01,360
I

2743
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:10,960
Just because it's very bad for them, I mean it's bad for us too, but

2744
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:17,120
I care more about the rats than me and also it tastes good. So whatever. I'm here for I'm here for uh

2745
02:14:17,680 --> 02:14:20,560
I'm here for a good time not for a long time

2746
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:23,520
I

2747
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:32,800
When do you think the cover with kaifu will be out? That's a good question. Let me check twitter

2748
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:36,080
I um

2749
02:14:36,080 --> 02:14:39,520
I still have a couple of edits that need to be done

2750
02:14:40,160 --> 02:14:42,160
for the video

2751
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:44,720
So it really just depends on

2752
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:51,520
Really just depends on the editor. They haven't really responded to my

2753
02:14:52,640 --> 02:14:57,280
Adjustments, so I'll have to wait for them. Um, so I can't really tell you

2754
02:14:58,240 --> 02:15:02,800
When but I'm hoping really soon because everything is done. I just need to have the edits on the um

2755
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:05,760
On the video done and that's pretty much it

2756
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:14,240
We eat the food that's bad for us by choice we decide what our pets eat

2757
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:21,280
True they would probably eat food that's bad for them too if they could decide

2758
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:25,040
But they can't because I feed them because I'm their overlord

2759
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:27,440
Yeah

2760
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:29,440
Yep

2761

02:17:25,520 --> 02:17:27,520
But without the boobs

2784
02:17:28,480 --> 02:17:30,480
Nice zootie. Yeah

2785
02:17:31,520 --> 02:17:36,800
There you go. That's what it's called. Um, the script three is under the foot of the mafia. I actually liked that one

2786
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:41,120
I thought it was kind of fun. I liked the recording that one. Um,

2787
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,480
I feel like I'm really good at acting like

2788
02:17:45,600 --> 02:17:47,600
An annoying rich girl

2789
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:54,240
So I played as like the daughter of the mafia boss in that one. I feel like I I played that off pretty good

2790
02:17:59,440 --> 02:18:02,160
Petan zootie chat cheese size zootie. Yeah

2791
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:10,560
Um, and the last one is just gamer girlfriend wants attention this one. I um, I think this is the only girlfriend one that was

2792
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:15,840
For this month or no flat chested friction had girlfriend. I remember editing the last one though

2793
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:19,200
I think I edited the last one to be a little bit more. Lovey-dovey

2794
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:23,840
And also, oh my god. I have to change some of it. Let me let me just

2795
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:26,320
Let me just read to you

2796
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:29,920
I it's not in the script anymore. I removed it, but let me just read to you some of this stuff

2797
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:36,160
Oh, thank you

2798

2799
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:44,960
The giggle sticks returns literally um

2800
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:48,560
I

2801
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:51,600
Man, it's not

2802
02:18:51,600 --> 02:18:57,200
If you want it, then you'll have to take it, but you already knew that frick use my face like a rented

2807
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:22,000
Pour it down my throat like a chug jug

2808
02:19:22,880 --> 02:19:25,920
I didn't say that I I couldn't I couldn't say that

2809
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:28,640

2810
02:19:30,480 --> 02:19:32,480
The winner of a winner

2811
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:35,920
Um, most of it was okay though

2812
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:38,800
Most of it was okay. I think

2813
02:19:40,560 --> 02:19:42,560
There was another part that was funny though

2814
02:19:44,400 --> 02:19:46,400
Let me find it

2815
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:01,920
Oh, I hear you eating combos up there

2816
02:20:02,480 --> 02:20:09,600

2817
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:12,080

2818
02:20:12,560 --> 02:20:14,560
Think I cut up a little bit of that too

2819
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:19,360
Is my fallatio getting you ratioed

2820
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:24,560
No, there was no monkey noises in this one

2821
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:36,080
But yeah, there was a lot of like gamer references that I didn't really understand

2822
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:39,280
in these scripts

2823
02:20:39,440 --> 02:20:45,680
Like I I don't know what game it seems pretty obvious what game um the listener was playing

2824
02:20:46,320 --> 02:20:51,920
But I don't know. I don't know what it is. What are these rhymes? He's trying to be a rapper

2825
02:20:54,960 --> 02:20:57,680
Is this the censored version? Yeah, I had to censor it a little bit

2826
02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:02,720
Someone give the script writer a raise

2827
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:05,520
I'm not sure about that

2828
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:09,360
I'm not sure about that but like there was like a

2829
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:13,600
There was like a grand theft auto

2830
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:21,120
Reference in in the jeep in the mafia boss one and I was like what the fuck does who who?

2831
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000

2832
02:21:24,480 --> 02:21:26,880

2839
02:21:54,720 --> 02:21:56,880
It's a different one for girls only

2840
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:03,280
And I was looking through the server and it's like oh my god. There's so many there's so many like

Some of them. I'm like wait. Are you guys allowed to be here with us?

So I don't know we'll see we'll see um we'll see what happens, but like

2847
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:30,960
Yes, it'll be a roleplay server

2848
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:35,360
I don't know how to roleplay and I've never played gta, but um

2849
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:38,400
I'm excited

2850
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:40,240
I'm excited

2851
02:22:40,240 --> 02:22:45,680
Hopefully I'm allowed to say that. I don't know did I ruin the surprise. I mean I didn't say much about it

2852
02:22:46,480 --> 02:22:48,480
It might not even happen. I don't know

2853
02:22:48,640 --> 02:22:51,680
Forget what I said. I didn't say anything. I didn't say anything

2854
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:56,880
Um, oh my god. Sorry. I'm just like seeing the names of who joined and I'm like getting excited

2855
02:22:58,160 --> 02:23:00,160
I know her

2856
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:03,040
I

2857
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:10,080
Sorry, I'm gonna take she be real quick

2858
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:27,920
Okay, anyways

2859
02:23:28,320 --> 02:23:32,160
Well, let me see the one gta 5 line. I don't know what line you're talking about

2860
02:23:32,960 --> 02:23:38,400
It's probably fine. What is the server you're roleplaying right now. No, I'm not

2861
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
But um

2862
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:55,840
I'm excited. I've never played gta before the only time I've ever

2863
02:23:56,720 --> 02:24:03,840
Like interacted with gta was when I went over to my cousin's house and um

2864
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:06,880
He was playing gta

2865
02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:12,640
And he was like, hey watch this watch. We were like fucking eight and he was like, hey watch this watch this

2866
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:20,880
And so he presses something on the on the controller and it starts to buzz and I see like giggling or I hear giggling or something

2867
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:25,520
On the tv and um, and he gives me the controller to hold it as it's buzzing and I'm like

2868
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:30,080
What's happening? What's what why is the controller buzzing and he's like

2869
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:45,760
And I was like, oh and then I laughed a little bit

2870
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:48,640
Oh

2871
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:50,960
That's the one time I played

2872
02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:54,240
um

2873
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:05,280
Yeah, that's the one but that's the one time I played um grand theft auto which one

2874
02:25:08,400 --> 02:25:10,320
Beats me. I don't know

2875
02:25:10,320 --> 02:25:15,200
The one that was out like years and years and years and years and years ago. I don't know

2876
02:25:16,480 --> 02:25:18,880
We're getting in me and gta before gta

2877
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:21,520
Is that gta 6?

2878
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:24,960
No way no weighing. I don't know roman numerals

2879
02:25:26,480 --> 02:25:28,480
I don't know them

2880
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:33,600
Yeah

2881
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:37,600
Over a decade. Oh, maybe

2882

Do you realize how little that narrows down? No

2886
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:01,520
No

2887
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:03,520

2888
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:18,160
I

2889
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:21,840
Don't

2890
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:30,720
Oh, we're almost at 47 k how exciting and 47 k is almost at 50 k how exciting

2891
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:40,800
Hold on I have to do you want to delete do you want to delete comments with me?

2892

Don't think I have uh, I don't think I have enough

2894
02:26:47,360 --> 02:26:50,560

No

2898
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:03,040
Go look for f4a

2899
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:06,640
We should delete comments together here here here. I'll try deleting some

2900
02:27:07,360 --> 02:27:09,360
No

2901
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:12,080
No, there's not really enough to delete before

2902
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:18,000
I could have like saved up comments for like three days and I'd have like a hundred to delete with you

2903
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:25,120
Amy censorship. Yeah, of course. I delete comments all the time. I get really shitty comments

2904
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:30,400
Of course, I'm gonna delete them on the short on videos on anything

2905
02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:34,160
Um

2906
02:27:39,360 --> 02:27:43,520
I'm gonna delete this one too. Hey

2907
02:27:44,960 --> 02:27:46,960
Um

2908
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:52,640
That one's a weird one

2909
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:04,160
Okay, I'm gonna delete that one too. It's mostly people like telling me what to do for some reason

2910
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:08,800
Um about anything like I get a lot of comments like stream on twitch

2911
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:11,040
stream on twitch

2912
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:16,800
Like you should stream on twitch. I recommend you stream on twitch. Why aren't you streaming on twitch? Um

2913
02:28:18,160 --> 02:28:20,160
I get a lot of comments like um

2914
02:28:21,440 --> 02:28:25,040
Oh, uh like on my ASMR roleplays there's people like um

2915
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:31,360
So this makes me uncomfortable to listen to can you please change the pronouns?

2916
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:35,280
Can you please redo the video with like different pronouns and it's like

2917
02:28:36,880 --> 02:28:41,680
I I delete those ones because like you can you can find videos with different pronouns

2918
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:43,680
You can find them

2919
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:44,960
easily

2920
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:47,760
Very easily. Well, you could probably just search up like

2921
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:54,320
You could search up like a lesbian audio roleplay like why are you asking me to redo the video?

2922
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:58,560
Yeah, it's a lot of back seating strangely. Um

2923
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:02,320
Some people being like, oh, this is gross, which is fine. Um

2924
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:10,320
That one is to be expected, but I just I didn't expect so much back seating, you know, why so much back seating?

2925
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:13,760
Pair dude to me specifically

2926
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:19,040
Twitch is overrated. Uh, it's not terrible. Um

2927
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:25,040
It's not terrible. I just don't like

2928
02:29:26,560 --> 02:29:28,400
um

2929
02:29:29,360 --> 02:29:35,520
I don't like the split the split is bad and um

2930
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:46,080
Like I feel like they have a lot of good um like streaming

2931
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:51,120
Activities, I don't know what to call it like add-ons

2932
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:53,920
I'm a girl, but I like the male POV

2933
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:59,760
You can like whatever you want. It's just the comments that say hey, can you make this in a different POV that are like

2934
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:09,040
No, but you can go look up different different ones that are for you. Um

2935
02:30:10,400 --> 02:30:12,400
They're they're quite easy to find

2936
02:30:12,400 --> 02:30:15,680
um, yeah, like the fleet the features on um

2937
02:30:18,240 --> 02:30:22,560
The features on twitch like the the channel points. I really enjoyed channel points

2938
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:28,080
I had a lot of fun channel point channel point stuff that I I just uh, I don't have anymore

2939
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:30,560
like, huh

2940
02:30:30,560 --> 02:30:34,480

um

2945
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:50,240
I had one where I could like have you um

2946
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:53,280
Make me talk in a British accent

2947
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:56,240
in a

2948
02:30:57,440 --> 02:31:00,480
In a like a cowboy western accent Texan accent

2949
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:03,280
I had like

2950
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:10,320
Those those those those like throwing things. What are they called like a twitch interactive

2951
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:16,800
Throwing system something like that where you could like throw shit at the vtuber. That's fun

2952
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:23,920
I liked that. I had like head pat redeems. Those were fine. I want to be head padded again

2953
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:26,880
Hold on

2954
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:29,280
like

2955
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:31,600
Chat can't even head pat me anymore

2956
02:31:34,480 --> 02:31:37,360
Can I make the animation at a higher fps? Hopefully not

2957
02:31:38,560 --> 02:31:40,560
Here there you go

2958
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:44,560
Now chat can head pat me a little more

2959
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:51,520
The twitch chat is incredibly spamming with too many emotes more often than not

2960
02:31:52,240 --> 02:31:58,400
Look at my chat right now. There's so many emotes. There's nothing wrong with emotes. I don't care if people spam emotes

2961
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:00,640
um

2962
02:32:00,640 --> 02:32:02,640
Oops, sorry. I I got big

2963
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:08,640
Can you do the southern accent now? No

2964
02:32:10,400 --> 02:32:15,280
I'm really bad at it. I'm really bad at both accents, but that's what made them funny, you know

2965
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:20,400
The emotes. Yeah, they have animated emotes too, which is really cool

2966
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:25,600
I wish we had animated emotes. I literally I uh, I commissioned um

2967
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:31,040
I commissioned an animated emotes for the pin pals and I can't even use it

2968
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:36,480
I'll just have to post it on twitter and let you guys use it if you want. It's really cute. I think you guys will like it

2969
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:39,920
I think you guys will like it. It's really funny

2970
02:32:41,440 --> 02:32:46,240
You know british accent is surprisingly good, bro. I've had real british people be like what the fuck is that accent?

2971
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:49,600
It's bad

2972
02:32:52,640 --> 02:32:56,880
Thank you for the the head pads. I had to give them to myself, but it's okay

2973
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:04,320
Yeah, and twitch has a lot of like games that are built in to interact with your twitch chat too

2974
02:33:04,720 --> 02:33:06,720
and I think those are fun like um

2975
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:09,040
Like cult of the lamb

2976
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:14,880
You can like have your your chat like either help you or you know, um

2977
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:23,520
What's it called uh sabotage you I think right like that's fun

2978
02:33:24,880 --> 02:33:29,840
Overall the viewer experiences way better on twitch the chat is much better and differently from youtube

2979
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:34,800
You can use emotes from channels you're sub to in every channels chat. Yeah, that's cool too

2980
02:33:36,480 --> 02:33:38,480
Real british people exist. Yes

2981
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:40,640
I'm a real british people

2982
02:33:40,640 --> 02:33:44,000
And I think it's a lot better than most british accents I've heard online really

2983
02:33:44,880 --> 02:33:46,880
Why thank you

2984
02:33:48,240 --> 02:33:51,840
Um, does marbles on stream work on youtube? I don't know. I don't know

2985
02:33:53,840 --> 02:33:58,480
I don't know. I never played marbles on stream. Well, I tried playing it once, but I couldn't figure out how to get it to work

2986
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:07,120
So for being such a big company youtube streaming surprisingly shit, it's just not

2987
02:34:09,440 --> 02:34:11,200
It's just not um

2988
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:16,240
Interactive with chat that's all it's like they don't it's on the back burner for them. They don't really care

2989
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:18,480
to um

2990
02:34:18,480 --> 02:34:20,480
Make it better. I think

2991
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:22,880
and that's you know

2992
02:34:22,880 --> 02:34:24,160
the issue

2993
02:34:24,160 --> 02:34:27,680
They don't really care to improve on it whereas twitch is all streaming. So it's like

2994
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:30,240
You would hope that they would be better at it, you know

2995
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:36,320
But youtube is more just for videos. That's what they focus on

2996
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:39,280
you know

2997
02:34:40,240 --> 02:34:43,120
Um, actually if you start off as a sheep in the cult of the lamp

2998
02:34:46,480 --> 02:34:52,000
The bit rate and viewing experience on youtube is better. I know the viewer interaction is better on twitch. My bit rate is always shit

2999
02:34:54,320 --> 02:34:56,720
My bit rate always looks like shit most of the time

3000
02:34:58,400 --> 02:35:04,560
If i'm playing a game that's like a little bit nice graphics, it looks poop. I don't know how to fix it

3001
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:13,520
YouTube doesn't care enough. They could easily outcompete twitch if they wanted to yeah, they don't care enough. It's me

3002
02:35:13,840 --> 02:35:15,840
It's okay. I'm not here to

3003
02:35:16,080 --> 02:35:18,080
I'm not here to um

3004
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:27,280
Try to make a change in youtube. I don't care. I don't care. There goes my hair clip

3005
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:36,560
Which operates at a massive loss so youtube probably won't care to catch up to twitch

3006
02:35:38,240 --> 02:35:42,960
Oh, is it because it's owned by amazon amazon likes to operate businesses at a loss don't they?

3007
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:50,000
But they take 50 percent. Where is that money going?

3008
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:55,600
Like 50 percent of revenue is really really high

3009
02:35:57,600 --> 02:35:59,600
like genuinely like

3010
02:36:00,960 --> 02:36:02,560
like

3011
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:04,560
company vtubers that stream on twitch like

3012
02:36:06,240 --> 02:36:12,560
They must be making like 25 percent of their income or something like that's really really high

3013
02:36:14,800 --> 02:36:20,240
This is why I do all my streaming on omegle. This is why I do all my streaming on facebook streaming

3014
02:36:20,320 --> 02:36:22,160
I don't know facebook live

3015
02:36:22,160 --> 02:36:25,920
Instagram reels all my streams will now be on instagram guys

3016
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:34,560
To the ceo. Oh, that's why they operate as uh with a loss because all the money is just going back to the ceo

3017
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:41,920
A really weird keep up thor did a breakdown of how much one stream for them costs and it's very weird

3018
02:36:42,560 --> 02:36:44,560
Oh, well do it better

3019
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:46,480
I don't know

3020
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:49,440
Do it better. I'm sure they could figure out a way to make it better

3021
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:56,160
My favorite feature of twitch is the emotes of channels you become a member of can be used in other channels

3022
02:36:56,160 --> 02:36:58,640
Yeah, I really like that too. I really like that too

3023
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
But I guess here you can't do it

3024
02:37:10,800 --> 02:37:15,440
I don't know if youtube operates at a loss to be honest. I don't know

3025
02:37:17,200 --> 02:37:20,800
I don't know anything about these businesses

3026
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:23,520
Okay

3027
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:29,680
This is now this is epic. Also a lot of people say I sound like marceline

3028
02:37:30,480 --> 02:37:35,600
Do I sound like marceline? No one in real life has ever ever ever told me I sound like marceline

3029
02:37:50,800 --> 02:37:52,800
Oh

3030
02:38:05,920 --> 02:38:07,920
It's gonna get copyrighted isn't it

3031
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:13,600
It's awesome

3032
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:18,160
Being read all down the produce aisle. It was awesome. I don't think I sound like marceline

3033
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:23,440
I

3034
02:38:26,320 --> 02:38:28,320
Kind of

3035
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:34,640
Oh no, man, the shrimp must have gone bad or something because all that red came right back up

3036
02:38:35,360 --> 02:38:38,960
Still invisible and yacking red all down the produce aisle. It was awesome

3037
02:38:40,480 --> 02:38:43,920
Not really don't think so can't tell

3038
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:47,040
Kind of almost

3039
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:56,000
Kind of sort of I don't think okay, it seems like I'm getting a lot of mixed uh mixed answers

3040
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:01,280
That girl in the beginning

3041
02:39:03,440 --> 02:39:05,440
Princess bubblegum or

3042
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:09,520
I don't know who the character was

3043
02:39:10,480 --> 02:39:12,480
That's marceline just looks weird

3044
02:39:13,440 --> 02:39:19,600
I think it's the vocal fry maybe uh, I don't know why I have that. I don't know why I have that

3045
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:23,680
It just comes naturally to me

3046
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:27,520
I sound like the grudge

3047
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:37,760
Similar inflections but not the same sound more God

3048
02:39:38,320 --> 02:39:40,320
I

3049
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:42,640
Wow a woman

3050
02:39:44,480 --> 02:39:48,800
That doesn't sound super high pitched mommy sorry mommy

3051
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:53,600
Please let me suck on your tiggly winks. Oh mommy, please. Oh

3052
02:39:55,440 --> 02:40:02,400
Mommy, please. Let me put my face in between your badonka dunks and jiggle it around. Please. Let me feel my mommy, please

3053
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:06,800
It's like you're burping in slow motion

3054
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:09,760
You

3055
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:20,720
Sound like a japanese horror movie girl. Yeah, that's the grudge is it not the grudge

3056
02:40:24,560 --> 02:40:30,480
What happens after that doesn't get said on youtube. Thank you mommy. Oh my gosh. Thank you mommy. Oh

3057
02:40:38,320 --> 02:40:46,160
I don't know I don't know what sound fat makes when it jiggles around clap clap clap clap

3058
02:40:55,440 --> 02:40:58,080
That's a perfect clip clip it then

3059
02:41:00,480 --> 02:41:02,480
Plop plop plop plop

3060
02:41:03,040 --> 02:41:05,040
Maybe a little bit of shlurpin

3061
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:10,320
I'm sorry. I should watch adventure time again. I really like adventure time

3062
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:13,840
I see that as if I haven't watched it like 10 times already

3063
02:41:14,880 --> 02:41:17,280
I watched adventure time a lot. It's a really big uh

3064
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:20,080
comfort show for me

3065
02:41:20,080 --> 02:41:22,080
and I don't know why

3066
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:30,560
Um what the sigma any ideas when the ada ada short would be going up? I think usually it takes about a week for

3067
02:41:31,520 --> 02:41:36,640
My shorts to get edited but sometimes it can take longer than a week. Um

3068
02:41:38,400 --> 02:41:45,840
It's really bad though. I don't really like like people assume that I can do it well, but I can't I I really can't and

3069
02:41:46,640 --> 02:41:50,160
I think I might even delete it if it doesn't get popular because I

3070
02:41:50,960 --> 02:41:52,480
Actually hate it so much

3071
02:41:52,480 --> 02:41:58,560
Like it's actually really really cringe and I like I know it's cringe like I know people will find a cringe. Um

3072
02:41:59,440 --> 02:42:01,120
And I know it doesn't sound good

3073
02:42:01,120 --> 02:42:06,640
But I'm trying to be like oh, maybe other people will think it sounds good and then it'll get popular

3074
02:42:07,120 --> 02:42:11,200
Because obviously it's me. I don't think anything I say sounds good, but other people do

3075
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:17,520
So if I try saying ada ada, maybe they'll like it even if I don't you know like I know it's cringe

3076
02:42:17,920 --> 02:42:21,520
That's why I'm like if this doesn't get popular. I might just delete it because it's too cringe

3077
02:42:23,440 --> 02:42:26,240
I don't want to embrace the cringe. It's really cringe

3078
02:42:27,040 --> 02:42:29,040
I like

3079
02:42:34,800 --> 02:42:40,320
Adventure time watch along. Uh, I don't know. I just I don't like watch alongs too much

3080
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:44,240
I know you say you like it

3081
02:42:45,440 --> 02:42:48,080
I'll play on repeat just so you don't delete it do it do it

3082
02:42:48,080 --> 02:42:52,320
If you don't want me to delete it then then get that short popular and then I won't delete it

3083
02:42:52,320 --> 02:42:55,360
I'll just to see that all the hate comments I get but I'll keep it up

3084
02:42:56,480 --> 02:43:01,520
Let me see if I can find it. I'll listen to it myself and see if I if I cringe or not

3085
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:04,640
Um, I'm gonna mute the audio so you can't hear it though

3086
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:07,760
Because it's surprise for you

3087
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:14,160
Hey home here I go here I go

3088
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:17,920
I'm prepared

3089
02:43:19,360 --> 02:43:21,360
Oh

3090
02:43:22,320 --> 02:43:24,320
Oh

3091
02:43:24,720 --> 02:43:29,920
Oh, it's bad. It's bad. I can't give you a sneak peek. It's just two words

3092
02:43:30,240 --> 02:43:35,600
You want me to give you like the first zero point zero one millisecond of the first add up like

3093
02:43:36,800 --> 02:43:39,520
There is no sneak peek. It's just two words

3094
02:43:43,040 --> 02:43:47,680
Speaking of popular 500k on that one short is it insane it is it is I

3095
02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:49,440
I

3096
02:43:49,440 --> 02:43:53,040
Don't know why that happened, but it is

3097
02:43:54,320 --> 02:43:56,880
um, I appreciate people that you know

3098
02:43:58,400 --> 02:44:02,800
Um watched it and subscribed and were respectful about it

3099
02:44:05,440 --> 02:44:07,440
Just say ah, ah

3100
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:15,200
There you go

3101
02:44:18,240 --> 02:44:21,280
For it not to be cringe you got to own it you got if you don't own it

3102
02:44:21,440 --> 02:44:27,440
It will be cringe if I show you what it sounds like. Will you will you be honest and tell me if it's cringe or not?

3103
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:33,520
Because I feel like you won't that's the thing like I don't know I don't know who to show it to for them to be like

3104
02:44:34,320 --> 02:44:37,360
Super honest with me. Like I need you to hurt my feelings, you know

3105
02:44:38,400 --> 02:44:43,760
Like I need you to like literally slap me across the face and spit in my mouth and grab my hair and throw it

3106
02:44:44,400 --> 02:44:46,400
Force it into the dirt and like

3107
02:44:46,400 --> 02:44:48,400
Scream at me to never say that ever again

3108
02:44:49,360 --> 02:44:50,400
like

3109
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:54,960
I feel like people aren't honest enough with me because they um, they don't want to hurt my feelings

3110
02:44:55,040 --> 02:44:57,040
But like I want you to hurt my feelings

3111
02:44:57,680 --> 02:44:59,120
Do you know what I mean?

3112
02:44:59,120 --> 02:45:02,560
So that way I know that it's bad and I don't do it again because like

3113
02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:06,080
I know that it's bad, but I'm I'm wondering if other people

3114
02:45:06,880 --> 02:45:08,880
Think it's bad, you know

3115
02:45:08,960 --> 02:45:11,360
I'm I'm just talking in a circle at this point

3116
02:45:12,320 --> 02:45:16,080
I have been honest always people are not honest. That's what I'm saying. They're not

3117
02:45:17,360 --> 02:45:19,360
They're not honest and that's why it's like

3118
02:45:20,880 --> 02:45:24,800
I don't I was already cringe by default. I can't laugh it is that's what I'm saying

3119
02:45:26,160 --> 02:45:29,040
It is cringe and it took me so many tries to say it too

3120
02:45:29,360 --> 02:45:35,920
It took me so many tries because I kept cringing and I'm sure I've I've done better takes of it while I was trying

3121
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:38,720
But I just kept cringing and I was like no I can't do it. I can't do it

3122
02:45:39,200 --> 02:45:42,560
Delete that one. Let me try again and then I eventually just landed on

3123
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:45,440
The one I have in the audio

3124
02:45:45,440 --> 02:45:49,520
But it's cringe like just just naturally it is cringe, you know

3125
02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:55,040
Y'all are saying you'll be honest, but I know you lie. You lie

3126
02:45:56,560 --> 02:46:00,000
Some people have very very different tastes. What's cringe to some is not to others

3127
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:02,560
I know

3128
02:46:02,560 --> 02:46:04,560
I know

3129
02:46:05,920 --> 02:46:07,920
I don't know

3130
02:46:08,960 --> 02:46:10,960
I

3131
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:16,000
Just can't tell if you always want us to be honest because sometimes if you say

3132
02:46:16,720 --> 02:46:21,680
To not be honest like to say something is good. Anyways, if that makes us if I tell you to say something is good

3133
02:46:21,760 --> 02:46:23,760
Then yes, of course say it's good

3134
02:46:24,480 --> 02:46:26,480
I mean look at us. We're all cringe. I know

3135
02:46:27,040 --> 02:46:29,040
but um

3136
02:46:29,360 --> 02:46:35,200
Enjoyed this dream in background while working on controllers thx for being here pumpkin

3137
02:46:35,360 --> 02:46:37,360
Oh

3138
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:40,080
Thank you. I'm glad you enjoyed it

3139
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:48,800
I'm the same way, which is why I'm so honest. I'd rather get told I'm cringe than get lied to no sometimes

3140
02:46:48,800 --> 02:46:50,800
I want you to lie to me sometimes

3141
02:46:51,280 --> 02:46:52,800
Sometimes I

3142
02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:54,480
Sometimes I want you to lie to me, okay?

3143
02:46:54,480 --> 02:46:58,960
When I tell you to lie to me lie to me, but when I tell you to be honest to me be honest to me

3144
02:46:58,960 --> 02:47:00,960
It's pretty simple. It's pretty simple. Okay

3145
02:47:02,080 --> 02:47:04,080
You ever get tired of speaking in your high voice? No

3146
02:47:05,040 --> 02:47:07,840
Unless I'm sick or depressed as fuck

3147
02:47:08,480 --> 02:47:10,480
then yes

3148
02:47:10,800 --> 02:47:12,400
um

3149
02:47:12,400 --> 02:47:15,920
I respect you too much not to be honest with to you, but some people don't

3150
02:47:16,800 --> 02:47:19,440
Also, some people are just too nice in general, you know

3151
02:47:21,040 --> 02:47:25,840
Yes, just listen to what I tell you to do. It's not complicated. Oh, it's very simple

3152
02:47:26,560 --> 02:47:31,280
It's so simple. It's not complicated. I don't know why you think it's complicated

3153
02:47:31,520 --> 02:47:33,520
It's so simple

3154
02:47:35,280 --> 02:47:37,840
We walk a thin line with all the flip-flop like just just

3155
02:47:38,880 --> 02:47:41,680
Just do what I tell you to okay

3156
02:47:42,560 --> 02:47:44,560
It's really not that hard

3157
02:47:44,960 --> 02:47:46,960
Listen to what I say and do it

3158
02:47:48,560 --> 02:47:50,560
Understood

3159
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:59,360
We won't lie you just don't want us to say we like it so you won't do it again jokes

3160
02:47:59,440 --> 02:48:01,440
But I promise I'll be honest with this

3161
02:48:02,560 --> 02:48:06,080
I'm scared. I'm too nervous. You'll see when it comes out. You'll see when it comes out

3162
02:48:06,640 --> 02:48:11,360
Let let the editor do it that way when you when you see it um in your in your um

I cooked so hard that the kitchen like

3176
02:49:14,160 --> 02:49:17,840
Caught on fire and the whole the whole building is being evacuated

3177
02:49:18,240 --> 02:49:21,760
And people are coughing at the this the smell of smoke from my cooking

3178
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:33,760
What do mommy say I don't know what do mommy say

3179
02:49:39,440 --> 02:49:43,680
It's like the brain rot stream you did please never do another one of those I won't do another one of those

I should have wiped you off my boobs that's where you should have gone into the trash afterwards

3194
02:51:00,560 --> 02:51:04,480
The brain rot stream was so painful it was the most fun I had in a while it was just bad

3195
02:51:05,200 --> 02:51:08,960
I had fun because we got to sing a little bit, but it was bad

3196
02:51:14,160 --> 02:51:17,200

02:51:35,680 --> 02:51:40,880
It was it was um divorced ASMR, but it was basically disappointed mom at the end

3201
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
I guess kaifu was a disappointed mom

3202
02:51:52,240 --> 02:51:56,080
There's other divorced ASMR and it's actually like pretty popular

3203
02:51:56,720 --> 02:52:01,680
Oh ours shows up pretty quick. Maybe because no, it's probably because I'm subscribed to kaifu

t okay for tick talk. It's the book side of tick talk

3260
02:56:46,880 --> 02:56:52,560
We want to see any specific wrecks. I've told you my favorite book before but I think no one paid attention to it

3261
02:56:52,560 --> 02:56:54,560
So now no one knows

3262
02:56:54,800 --> 02:56:56,800
You don't know

3263
02:56:56,800 --> 02:56:58,800
Yeah, y'all never know

3264
02:56:58,880 --> 02:57:00,880
horror horror

3265
02:57:01,840 --> 02:57:04,880
What scenarios do you like best when you look for boyfriend ASMR like

3266
02:57:05,440 --> 02:57:09,360
Do you want it to be more comfy with the yandana stuff as well? Yes for sure comfy

3267
02:57:09,440 --> 02:57:11,920
I don't like it when there's like a lot of stuff happening

3268
02:57:12,560 --> 02:57:13,840
um

3269
02:57:13,840 --> 02:57:16,560
I know I've made audios where like a lot of shit is happening

3270
02:57:16,640 --> 02:57:20,240
But that's because I'm just a bad writer and I I'm like I ran out of ideas

3271
02:57:20,240 --> 02:57:24,880
So I'm like I need something to happen, but I don't like it when there's like a lot of stuff happening

3272
02:57:24,880 --> 02:57:26,880
I like something casual, you know

3273
02:57:27,280 --> 02:57:29,280
I'm in casual

3274
02:57:30,720 --> 02:57:32,720
Any kind of radiates book talk energy

3275
02:57:33,920 --> 02:57:36,240
I don't know what that means, but I am on book talk

3276
02:57:40,480 --> 02:57:45,040
Is it like when people read books on tick talk no not really it's more like

3277
02:57:45,840 --> 02:57:51,280
It's more of people like reading books like reviewing books recommending you books, you know being like

3278
02:57:51,920 --> 02:57:53,920
Here are the top 10

3279
02:57:54,080 --> 02:57:55,760
spiciest

3280
02:57:55,760 --> 02:58:01,520
Romance novels I've read in the last I don't know six months or something. Um

3281
02:58:04,400 --> 02:58:06,400
Stuff like that

3282
02:58:06,560 --> 02:58:08,560
I

3283
02:58:16,800 --> 02:58:23,680
They say are a summer's wide wild the stuff the ladies like is wild. I know both sides are wild both sides have really wild stuff

3284
02:58:25,840 --> 02:58:28,400
I listen to your favorite songs and they were interesting to say the least

3285
02:58:29,040 --> 02:58:30,240
Thank you

3286
02:58:30,240 --> 02:58:31,520
I don't know

3287
02:58:31,520 --> 02:58:35,680
I have do I have more favorite songs? I don't know my favorite songs

3288
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
Are kind of all over the place

3289
02:58:39,920 --> 02:58:45,040
Let me look up on my spot if I there are mommy and that is if that makes it better for you for me

3290
02:58:47,920 --> 02:58:49,920
For me

3291
02:58:50,240 --> 02:58:52,240
There's daddy on that is too

3292
02:58:58,160 --> 02:59:00,160
Sorry, I'm sniffling. I don't know why

3293
02:59:01,200 --> 02:59:03,760
What are your favorite bands? I don't have any actually

3294
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:05,200
I

3295
02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:11,760
Don't like old songs. Not really. No, sometimes I'll find one that I like but most of the songs I like are pretty

3296
02:59:12,960 --> 02:59:14,960
New pretty new

3297
02:59:15,840 --> 02:59:18,800
When do you have time to read between sleeping doing ASMR and streaming me?

3298
02:59:19,520 --> 02:59:21,520
um, I'm trying to slow down

3299
02:59:22,400 --> 02:59:25,840
It's it's hard to say this I'm trying to slow down because like

3300
02:59:26,560 --> 02:59:29,520
I'm really bad at managing the content I want to make so

3301
02:59:29,600 --> 02:59:33,280
As much as I want to get stuff done

3302
02:59:33,440 --> 02:59:39,040
I'm like so bad at managing that I end up procrastinating and not getting stuff done anyways

3303
02:59:39,520 --> 02:59:42,960
So I'm trying to slow down and hopefully I'll be able to like

3304
02:59:43,840 --> 02:59:45,840
If I have less plans to do

3305
02:59:46,720 --> 02:59:52,800
Then I will hopefully do it, but I'm not even doing much anyways in the first place

3306
02:59:53,760 --> 02:59:56,800
I'm not even doing much anyways. Like I'm doing nothing

3307
02:59:57,440 --> 03:00:03,040
I am literally most of the time doing nothing. So it's really hard to say like, oh, yeah, I'm actually gonna be doing less

3308
03:00:04,880 --> 03:00:06,880
I'm gonna be doing less than nothing

3309
03:00:07,520 --> 03:00:09,520
Yeah, um

3310
03:00:09,600 --> 03:00:14,560
But I'm still planning to record a video like an ASMR video this week

3311
03:00:15,520 --> 03:00:17,520
um

3312
03:00:17,920 --> 03:00:19,920
Yeah

3313
03:00:20,880 --> 03:00:22,880
How can a dad be a yandere?

3314
03:00:26,880 --> 03:00:28,880
Insects

3315
03:00:33,520 --> 03:00:37,920
Cool did it ASMR slept on imagine a cool chick all aloof and casual but the QC stuff comes out

3316
03:00:38,560 --> 03:00:40,560
As she talks to you I'd love more of that

3317
03:00:41,440 --> 03:00:43,440
I don't know

3318
03:00:46,080 --> 03:00:48,080
I

3319
03:00:49,120 --> 03:00:54,720
Miss want to die bro. What's wrong with miss want to die that bro that song hits so hard. I love miss want to die

3320
03:00:57,600 --> 03:01:00,720
It makes sense to slow down you mentioned being overwhelmed. I know but like

3321
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:02,960
I'm like

3322
03:01:02,960 --> 03:01:05,920
Why am I even overwhelmed? I guess I'm not even overwhelmed

3323
03:01:06,960 --> 03:01:08,960
I'm just bad at

3324
03:01:09,520 --> 03:01:10,800
Being

3325
03:01:10,800 --> 03:01:12,560
normal

3326
03:01:12,560 --> 03:01:14,080
I guess

3327
03:01:14,080 --> 03:01:15,440
um

3328
03:01:15,440 --> 03:01:19,520
I caught up with you for the book club. I have to say I see why you're reacting how you did

3329
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:23,760
I'm gonna get to you reading that tonight, but

3330
03:01:27,760 --> 03:01:29,760
Those chapters

3331
03:01:33,440 --> 03:01:35,440
I know I hit it hit a lot of the

3332
03:01:36,400 --> 03:01:38,400
Hit a lot of my um

3333
03:01:39,760 --> 03:01:41,760
I don't even know how to describe

3334
03:01:43,200 --> 03:01:48,880
Hit a lot of my funny bones my funny bones got hard. Um

3335
03:01:49,200 --> 03:01:51,200
Is

3336
03:01:53,840 --> 03:01:57,120
It like feeling is it feeling like being unorganized? Yes

3337
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:02,160
Definitely definitely very unorganized. Yes. I am very unorganized

3338
03:02:02,880 --> 03:02:05,760
Nothing. I don't I'm not an organized person at all. No

3339
03:02:06,720 --> 03:02:11,760
I've I have been organized before and the times where I was my most organized

3340
03:02:12,640 --> 03:02:15,680
Were the times where I got the most stuff done

3341
03:02:16,400 --> 03:02:21,040
Not necessarily times where I felt the greatest but it's like

3342
03:02:22,480 --> 03:02:24,480
I don't know how to explain it

3343
03:02:26,400 --> 03:02:28,400
I don't know how to explain it

3344
03:02:28,640 --> 03:02:30,640
It's hard. It's hard to explain

3345
03:02:30,960 --> 03:02:34,800
Imagine being normal so cringe. I want to be normal. I want to be a normie

3346
03:02:35,920 --> 03:02:37,920
I want to be a normie that doesn't have to think about stuff

3347
03:02:39,440 --> 03:02:41,440
I want to be a brainless normie

3348
03:02:42,560 --> 03:02:44,560
You know

3349
03:02:45,280 --> 03:02:47,840
Sebian is still better than mallard. I know I I

3350
03:02:50,640 --> 03:02:52,640
I like them both equally

3351
03:02:57,680 --> 03:02:59,680
I like them both equally

3352
03:03:00,720 --> 03:03:04,800
I need external motivation to do stuff like have someone tell me something has to get done

3353
03:03:05,680 --> 03:03:08,400
Yeah, I need external motivation too, but the problem is

3354
03:03:09,600 --> 03:03:11,600
I'm not like

3355
03:03:11,680 --> 03:03:16,640
I'm not always great at sticking to the external motivation, you know, especially when like

3356
03:03:17,840 --> 03:03:23,360
Strani is so nice. So she's never like, hey, I asked you to do this on this day, but you never did it

3357
03:03:23,360 --> 03:03:27,840
You know, she doesn't do that. She's just like when I the before I used to ask for

3358
03:03:29,440 --> 03:03:33,360
For some stuff I used to ask for deadlines, but I wouldn't always stick to them

3359
03:03:33,840 --> 03:03:36,960
So I felt bad continuing to ask so I stopped

3360
03:03:37,520 --> 03:03:40,400
Um, because she especially she's too nice. She's not like, hey

3361
03:03:41,280 --> 03:03:43,280
You didn't do it by your deadline

3362
03:03:43,280 --> 03:03:47,840
You know, she just didn't say that which is fine. She's too nice to say anything about it

3363
03:03:47,840 --> 03:03:51,360
So now I just don't ask for deadlines and I just I just do on my own time

3364
03:03:52,800 --> 03:03:57,520
Why don't we be your external motivation? We can give you that push. I feel like you're not you're not in my life

3365
03:03:58,080 --> 03:04:02,640
Like you have to be there constantly, you know, you have to be there constantly

3366
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:05,360
I can't constantly be telling you what I'm trying to do, you know

3367
03:04:06,240 --> 03:04:12,400
Unfortunately, I cannot constantly be streaming and talking to you, you know

3368
03:04:17,760 --> 03:04:18,800
I understand how you feel

3369
03:04:18,800 --> 03:04:22,800
I love writing as a hobby, but I can never finish because I have so many ideas in so little time

3370
03:04:23,920 --> 03:04:26,800
And so little energy for me so little energy

3371
03:04:27,520 --> 03:04:29,040
I don't know why

3372
03:04:29,040 --> 03:04:31,760
Maybe I'm just not eating healthy enough. That's fair

3373
03:04:32,640 --> 03:04:38,800
Uh, anxiety is a big problem for me. I procrastinate about stuff that stresses me out. Um

3374
03:04:39,840 --> 03:04:44,160
So then it stresses me out more. I've been doing that too. Yeah, I do that a lot

3375
03:04:50,640 --> 03:04:53,600
A true procrastinator, you can't be given the option that it's okay

3376
03:04:53,680 --> 03:04:56,640
It has to be real deadline. They hold you that they hold you too. Yeah

3377
03:04:57,360 --> 03:05:03,200
It has to be a real real deadline like literally you fucking kick me out of the company if I can't get it done in time like

3378
03:05:04,400 --> 03:05:05,600
That's what I mean

3379
03:05:05,600 --> 03:05:08,640
Like I can't I can't just be a suggestion

3380
03:05:09,040 --> 03:05:12,640
Because when I was in school, they would do this stupid shit where it's like

3381
03:05:13,280 --> 03:05:20,400
Oh, please have it done by I don't know. Let me look at the calendar. Please have it done by Wednesday, September 4th

3382
03:05:20,480 --> 03:05:24,160
Right, they would be like that. They would say the deadline is Wednesday for September 4th

3383
03:05:25,120 --> 03:05:26,400
But

3384
03:05:26,400 --> 03:05:33,600
You have a 24 hour extension automatically every student is giving a 20 every student is given a 24 hour extension

3385
03:05:34,240 --> 03:05:35,840
automatically

3386
03:05:35,840 --> 03:05:40,080
And when you tell me that that just means that it's due on Thursday, September 5th

3387
03:05:40,160 --> 03:05:44,240
That just tells me okay, great. It's not doing Wednesday. It's due on Thursday and I'm going to be doing it on Thursday

3388
03:05:45,520 --> 03:05:51,280
Yeah, like what do you mean an automatic extension to every student? That's just telling me it's it's due on Thursday

3389
03:05:55,120 --> 03:05:57,120
So

3390
03:05:57,520 --> 03:06:00,960
Every time you miss a deadline you need to post it out of short. No

3391
03:06:02,240 --> 03:06:04,640
That would be real punishment. That would be real punishment

3392
03:06:06,480 --> 03:06:09,920
Has a little sister her homework today. I don't have homework. Do you want to do?

3393
03:06:11,200 --> 03:06:15,280
So, you know, it's really funny people thought I was acting during that one asmr stream

3394
03:06:16,400 --> 03:06:18,400
Where um, I was doing homework

3395
03:06:18,880 --> 03:06:25,600
I'm generally that bad at math and I don't I I I don't know I don't know why

3396
03:06:32,160 --> 03:06:34,160
Here do you want to do exponents?

3397
03:06:34,160 --> 03:06:36,160
Oh

3398
03:06:59,840 --> 03:07:01,840
That's loud I don't know I so loud

3399
03:07:02,560 --> 03:07:09,280
Wait, okay, hold on. It's too loud turn the volume down. Can I can I pause wait guys wait guys hold on. I'm already

3400
03:07:11,360 --> 03:07:14,960
Hold on guys. Okay, whatever. Sorry, uh

3401
03:07:19,120 --> 03:07:21,120
What?

3402
03:07:21,840 --> 03:07:23,840
Oh, let's go

3403
03:07:25,040 --> 03:07:27,040
Let's go, okay

3404
03:07:27,760 --> 03:07:29,760
Uh, oh, okay

3405
03:07:30,480 --> 03:07:37,600
Oh, wait, these are simple. Oh, oh, is it four? Okay

3406
03:07:53,360 --> 03:07:55,360
Um

3407
03:07:56,720 --> 03:07:58,720
Um

3408
03:08:00,720 --> 03:08:02,720
See how it takes me a long time

3409
03:08:06,720 --> 03:08:09,040
See how it takes me a really long time

3410
03:08:11,280 --> 03:08:16,080
Don't tell me the answers. Hi, we're seeing math games online. Should I go to math games online?

3411
03:08:16,960 --> 03:08:18,960
cool math games

3412
03:08:19,360 --> 03:08:21,360
cool math games dot com

3413
03:08:24,560 --> 03:08:26,560
Where's the math games numbers?

3414
03:08:26,960 --> 03:08:31,920
Um multiplication slash division. I'm really bad at those

3415
03:08:36,560 --> 03:08:40,320
Math versus monsters I have to fucking watch an ad

3416
03:08:42,400 --> 03:08:45,840
No, it doesn't exist anymore. No, I'm on cool math games dot com right now

3417
03:08:48,160 --> 03:08:52,560
The speed doesn't matter it's the result even the result is bad sometimes

3418
03:08:57,120 --> 03:08:59,120
Let's see if this one will

3419
03:09:01,280 --> 03:09:06,240
All right, let me crop this out for you. I don't know why they always make the game so fucking tiny

3420

How do I play I maybe I should have pressed how to play

3427
03:09:56,480 --> 03:10:01,600
All right, hold on how to play use arrow keys to move there will be a question in

3428
03:10:02,400 --> 03:10:06,240
The center screen go to the green door that has the right answer. Oh

3429
03:10:06,800 --> 03:10:08,800

3433
03:10:33,040 --> 03:10:35,040
Bro

3434
03:10:35,680 --> 03:10:37,680
I can't even do the the actual

3435
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:41,840
Are you kidding me? I can't even do the actual game part of cool math games

3436
03:10:47,360 --> 03:10:49,360
Why can't they move? Oh

3437
03:10:54,480 --> 03:10:56,480
Oh

3438
03:10:56,880 --> 03:10:58,880
Um

3439
03:11:04,400 --> 03:11:07,120
It's 36 right nice

3440
03:11:08,480 --> 03:11:12,960
This one's 16 some of these are easy. I can do some of these these ones aren't that bad

3441
03:11:13,440 --> 03:11:15,440
Okay, this one's obviously um, oops

3442
03:11:16,560 --> 03:11:18,560

Oh

3445
03:11:27,040 --> 03:11:32,000
Okay, wait when they put like small numbers and then big numbers combined. I don't know

3446
03:11:32,960 --> 03:11:36,320
You have to make the numbers close to each other 18 times four. I feel like I need to

3447
03:11:37,680 --> 03:11:40,640
This isn't good. This is too easy. This is too easy

3448
03:11:42,800 --> 03:11:44,800
Give me you know what maybe I am good at math

3449
03:11:46,720 --> 03:11:49,520
Maybe actually I am good at math. What's applied math?

3450
03:11:54,960 --> 03:11:58,880
I know I'm a math genius. It's just too easy for me

3451
03:12:02,160 --> 03:12:04,160
Now if we were to do like actual

3452
03:12:05,040 --> 03:12:07,360
Math homework where I wouldn't have oops

3453
03:12:07,840 --> 03:12:12,800
I just closed the tab accident if we were to do like actual math homework where I wouldn't have like

3454
03:12:13,920 --> 03:12:15,920
Possible like three possible answers

3455
03:12:16,800 --> 03:12:18,800
um

3456
03:12:21,120 --> 03:12:23,120
Shut up

3457
03:12:24,640 --> 03:12:26,960
When the game for dollars is too easy

3458
03:12:27,840 --> 03:12:29,840
Shut up

3459
03:12:31,200 --> 03:12:34,560
Here me versus computer. I don't know how to play this one

3460
03:12:35,840 --> 03:12:42,240
Tap the screen to stop the dart. Well, I thought this was about math press and drag to set power and is this not about math?

3461
03:12:44,640 --> 03:12:51,120
I looked for math games. Oh my god. Okay. I'm gonna I'm gonna do ninth grade. Let's do ninth grade

3462
03:12:54,640 --> 03:12:56,640
Let's try that

3463
03:12:57,440 --> 03:12:59,440
Um, let's do algebra

3464
03:13:00,960 --> 03:13:02,960
Oh

3465
03:13:04,400 --> 03:13:06,400
Oh, no

3466
03:13:07,280 --> 03:13:09,280
Oh, no

3467
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:15,760
Oh, no, this isn't even a game. This isn't a game. This is just a question

3468
03:13:17,760 --> 03:13:22,160
Okay, another thing is I learned all of my math in french, right

3469
03:13:23,040 --> 03:13:25,200
All of my math I learned in french. Um

3470
03:13:27,200 --> 03:13:29,840
So when you say the word, um

3471
03:13:32,080 --> 03:13:38,000
Polynomials, I'm like what the fuck is a polynomial, you know

3472
03:13:41,520 --> 03:13:45,920
I don't know what that means. Um, okay

3473
03:13:52,960 --> 03:13:56,400
I think I okay, maybe this one's too hard

3474
03:13:59,120 --> 03:14:04,000
Just stop giving it to I think you need like a pen and paper for this one

3475
03:14:05,440 --> 03:14:07,440
I'm gonna I'm gonna randomly choose one

3476
03:14:08,080 --> 03:14:09,200
Okay

3477
03:14:09,200 --> 03:14:11,200
Ah, damn it. It's incorrect

3478
03:14:12,240 --> 03:14:16,800
It was um negative 15. Hey, I was close. I chose C instead of D

3479
03:14:17,520 --> 03:14:19,520
Oh

3480
03:14:19,840 --> 03:14:23,840
French algebra so scary. It's not I don't know. It's just as scary as regular math

3481
03:14:24,960 --> 03:14:26,960
Okay, we'll stop doing math. I'm sorry

3482
03:14:28,560 --> 03:14:32,640
Are you smarter than a fifth grader video game? The thing is that video game

3483
03:14:35,520 --> 03:14:39,440
I broke down a tier seeing that that was just ninth grade. Come on

3484
03:14:40,720 --> 03:14:44,240
That was just ninth grade the problem with are you smarter than a fifth grader?

3485
03:14:44,560 --> 03:14:46,560
Is that

3486
03:14:47,440 --> 03:14:54,160
I'll come on you gave me the answers in this article the game. It has like really shitty reviews and everyone hates it

3487
03:14:57,840 --> 03:15:01,280
There's an online game um play

3488
03:15:01,280 --> 03:15:15,280

3489
03:15:17,920 --> 03:15:19,920
Oops

If you want to join there's only 10 players allowed sadly so um

3499
03:16:19,120 --> 03:16:24,480
Number stream idea, I guess we can do this on members. We can play one round here together real quick

3500
03:16:25,440 --> 03:16:27,840
No one's joining guys. You don't want to join

So far I had a lot of fun

3589
03:24:33,200 --> 03:24:38,880
Yeah, it's a little bit of a long stream, surprisingly, but I had a lot of fun in that collab

3590
03:24:39,520 --> 03:24:41,520
um

3591
03:24:49,360 --> 03:24:55,840
So I hope you had fun watching it. I know it was blurry, but I'll try to fix that in the future

3592
03:24:57,280 --> 03:24:59,280
um

3593
03:25:03,360 --> 03:25:05,360
I'm so dead

3594
03:25:05,840 --> 03:25:12,000
I'm gonna go eat dinner. It's just leftover food from my favorite restaurant that I got last night

3595
03:25:13,200 --> 03:25:15,200
um

3596
03:25:16,320 --> 03:25:18,320
Is it dark outside? I can't tell

3597
03:25:20,800 --> 03:25:22,800
Oh, yeah, it's probably dark

3598
03:25:23,600 --> 03:25:26,720
What kind of food I just told you it's asian food

3599
03:25:27,520 --> 03:25:33,920
It's really good. I love that restaurant. I'm literally I'm literally debating on ordering again from that restaurant because I love it so much

3600
03:25:34,640 --> 03:25:39,200
I love it so much. Literally everything I've ordered from them ever has been like a hit

3601
03:25:40,160 --> 03:25:43,120
And that's really rare for me because I'm a really picky eater

3602
03:25:43,600 --> 03:25:46,560
But like everything I've ordered from them has been a hit so I'm like

3603
03:25:48,800 --> 03:25:52,000
Happy because I have never found a restaurant. I like that much

3604
03:25:54,080 --> 03:25:56,080
um

3605
03:25:57,680 --> 03:26:03,920
I'll see you Wednesday for the member stream. We're gonna be taking a nap together

3606
03:26:10,640 --> 03:26:14,160
Now I might move the member stream um

3607
03:26:15,840 --> 03:26:18,240
Just be on the lookout I might move it later

3608
03:26:19,040 --> 03:26:21,040
just because um

3609
03:26:22,000 --> 03:26:24,000
like before it's really hot that day

3610
03:26:24,800 --> 03:26:30,000
And I don't want to be like trying to fall asleep in the heat because that's gonna be really uncomfortable

3611
03:26:30,560 --> 03:26:33,760
So I might move it to like a couple hours later

3612
03:26:34,640 --> 03:26:36,160
um

3613
03:26:36,160 --> 03:26:37,760
We'll see

3614
03:26:37,760 --> 03:26:39,760
What if I accidentally just like sleep all night?

3615
03:26:40,880 --> 03:26:43,360
No to to later in the day to later in the day

3616
03:26:43,760 --> 03:26:47,920
I'm just gonna accidentally just stream for eight hours while I'm sleeping in the bed

3617
03:26:48,640 --> 03:26:53,840
And I'm gonna wake up and I won't even remember that I'm still streaming you think that'd be peak

3618
03:26:54,240 --> 03:26:58,880
That'd be embarrassing. I probably fart in my sleep. I don't want you to hear that

3619
03:27:04,080 --> 03:27:10,240
Okay, okay anyways, I'll see you on Wednesday. Um, have a good night or rest of your day

3620
03:27:11,360 --> 03:27:14,160
Um, I'll miss you every day that I'm not streaming

3621
03:27:14,240 --> 03:27:17,040
I'm always like I should stream today because I miss you

3622
03:27:17,760 --> 03:27:21,120
But I know I know I know I shouldn't stream every day. I I can't do it

3623
03:27:21,120 --> 03:27:28,000
But I I'll miss you tomorrow, but I'll see you Wednesday. Okay. Bye. Bye pookie. Love you

3624
03:27:51,120 --> 03:27:53,120
Oh

3625
03:28:21,120 --> 03:28:24,080
You
