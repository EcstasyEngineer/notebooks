1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,140
Psst, yo. Yeah, you dumbass. You got $100 on ya? Um, cuz I need it. I can do something

2
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:30,820
in return, mister. I'm a good girl. I can, like, offer my services. What kind? Eh, good

3
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:41,500
question. Let me think. Well, we're in this dark and dingy alleyway, in a scrupulous part

4
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:50,380
of town, so the only logical thing that I can do in return for an exchange of money is...

5
00:00:50,380 --> 00:01:01,380
ASMR, of course. Duh. Well, come on. If you've got the cash, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

6
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:07,180
I mean, who else is gonna offer you it? Are you telling me there's cute and funny girls

7
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:14,420
throwing themselves at you to tingle you? Exactly. So hurry up and hand it over already.

8
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:27,980
I love people who make it easy. Thanks. Um, alright. Let's see what I have on me that I can use to

9
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:39,980
make you tingle. Hmm. Oh, this'll do. It's my little plastic tube. You know that whole thing

10
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:47,060
where girls like cute small things? It's true. Like stationery, for example. The smaller the

11
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:53,100
cuter, and thus the better. That's why I have this little plastic paper clip holder.

12
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:25,620
Okay. Now ain't over. You're too tall for me to do this one.

13
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:46,620
Alright, so if each tingle is worth $5, then I only need to do this. 1, 2, 3, 4, 18 more times.

14
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:55,220
Oh, what? I don't even have enough things with me to do that. I'm gonna have to get really creative

15
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:05,020
with this. Oh, there's a glass bottle in the ground. What? Don't give me that look. It's

16
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:14,060
good to be resourceful. You know that, right? See? I can make do with this ear to ear. You

17
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:39,060
can't tell me that's not tingle ready with a straight face.

18
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:59,340
I could bite joke you? What? It's a tingle. I swear it is. Do you not want YouTube videos

19
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:07,900
or something? Goth roleplays are pretty popular at the moment. It's your $100. If you don't

20
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:14,900
want it, then fine. I'll think of something else. Ha, got ya.

21
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:59,900
Some cotton balls came out of my voodoo doll recently. I can repurpose it for now.

22
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:06,900
And if you enjoyed that sound, I can also do this too.

23
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:38,900
Then there's the super basic stuff like finger flittering. It's a bit boring, but I can mix

24
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,900
in some ear tapping too.

25
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:27,900
Oh, you have a request? And what would that be, mister? Of course I can run my fingers

26
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:35,900
through your hair. You made me nervous thinking it was something a little more explicit that

27
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:25,900
I do have tissues. I could try this. Have you been keeping count, by the way? I was starting

28
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:32,900
to lose track of how long I've been doing this for.

29
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:15,900
Maybe you like the sound of scratching? Yeah, like that. What do you think? It's good, right?

30
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:18,900
I suppose I can take my pins out to brush through your hair as well, but only because

31
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,900
you didn't make a fuss when handing over the money. You'd be surprised how many people

32
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,900
only want to pay me after the service.

33
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:31,900
Um, not to alarm you or anything, but you're starting to slouch over now. I think you're

34
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:41,900
passing out. You want more? Are you sure you can even handle more, though? I have a few

35
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:48,900
more things I could do then, but I'm going to need to get going soon.

36
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:34,900
This is the last one, sadly, but I'm really thankful for your business. You never know.

37
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,900
If you walk through here again, we could do this, and I'll actually be more prepared next

38
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:45,900
time, but I'll be quiet while you enjoy this last one.

39
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:37,900
I have to get going now, but thanks again for your patronage. Maybe I'll see you again

40
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:47,900
next time. Good night, mister.
