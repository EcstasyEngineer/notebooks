1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
All six VLR designs have been revealed, including myself.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,480
It's not traditional for an agency to have six talents for one generation,

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,760
but the development team said, and I quote,

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,440
there should be one design you naturally gravitate towards.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,200
So, who do you like the most?

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,240
Is it Icy?

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,320
The insomniac polar bear with scars?

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,440
Any the Hexmaniac of the group and the only one of us with a tattoo?

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,320
Strony the hypnotizing cuttlefish that's also siren, but can't sing.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,760
Mercy the love-struck yonder, but can't seem to ever love right.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,120
She be the bunny-milk who likes to work hard, but play harder.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,640
And last but certainly not least,

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,800
Ezra the goat goddess with milkers bigger than your b**ch.
