ვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვ

17
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Nice! Yay! Nice!

18
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So I can still have a nice wind blowing on me and get extra comfy.

19
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yay! I'm glad, I'm glad.

20
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Very happy.

21
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The weather is weird, like some days are a bit hotter than others and then some days are actually really nice and have a cold wind and stuff.

22
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Ah, it's been kind of all over the place.

23
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But I would prefer it for it to be all over the place like this than for it to be like super, super hot.

24
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Like every day I would literally die from heat.

25
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
How are you doing today?

26
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I hope you're all doing well.

27
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I missed you and I'm glad we get to spend more time together.

28
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And I'm so, so, so excited for Saturday.

29
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We're going to spend so much time together.

30
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Usually we only spend...

31
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Usually...

32
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Ah, I feel better already.

33
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Honestly, same. Me too.

34
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm so happy because usually we spend around like two hours together and stuff.

35
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But this Saturday we can spend like I think like almost five hours together.

36
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Because like the movie is about like close to three hours, right?

37
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And then the karaoke is going to be either one or two hours.

38
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Depending on my energy.

39
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Depending on like my voice as well, I guess.

40
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Like if my throat is going to start hurting, I am going to have to cut the karaoke shorter.

41
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But I'll make sure to drink lots of tea and make sure to rest my throat.

42
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And maybe you can help my throat heal as well.

43
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's really hard to stop being unhinged after yesterday.

45
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I feel like I'm on a roll now.

46
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I feel like I'm on a roll. I just can't stop.

47
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I just...

48
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry for making you feel uncomfortable or like really weird.

49
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm just...

50
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I just love you and you make me happy.

51
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So I like being playful with you.

52
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You know, I like being playful and have fun with you.

53
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And I can't help it that I like getting you all riled up, okay?

54
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I can't help it.

55
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I really like doing that.

56
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's really nice, you know?

57
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What? Never uncomfortable?

58
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay, that's good.

59
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I like you being playful with a cup too.

60
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay, okay.

61
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's...

62
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Fuck, why can't I talk normally?

63
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What is my fucking problem?

64
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I limited to two hours for regular streams.

65
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's not that I'm limited, but like usually after two hours,

66
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I get pretty pee around that time.

67
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Like I could stream for...

68
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Fuck, I don't want to yawn.

69
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Fuck, I literally just said...

70
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
How energized I'm feeling now that I'm here.

71
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And then you hear me fucking start yawning.

72
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's so over, fuck.

73
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
All right, no gaming stream.

74
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's time to have a napping stream.

75
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's time to go pee.

76
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Napping stream where I just...

77
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The snowberries relax you.

78
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It is true though, you do relax me.

79
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And you make me happy.

80
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And I just...

81
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Everyday has been so exciting to wake up to, you know?

82
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Like everyday has been so fun.

83
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And honestly, it's my fault that I'm a bit epee today

84
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
because I didn't take my usual nap.

85
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Like usually I take a nap before a stream,

86
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
but I didn't take one today because I...

87
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I was just like...

88
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I was just replying to morows all day, to be honest.

89
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Like ever since I woke up, I was just replying to morows.

90
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Pretty much the whole day.

91
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And I still have a backlog.

92
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I still have a backlog even after like...

93
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Going through them for like hours, like...

94
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Because like the thing is, the thing is,

95
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
when I try to like clear out the backlog,

96
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
whenever I try to clear the backlog,

97
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
usually what happens is I'm like,

98
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
okay, today is the day I'm clearing my backlog.

99
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And then I try to do that.

100
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And then I get like...

101
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I answer like a question.

102
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And then like...

103
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And then I get like five more morows, you know?

104
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Like remember how I told you,

105
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I had like over like a hundred morows?

106
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Like after I said it, I had like...

107
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I had like two hundred of them.

108
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And I was like, oh my god,

109
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm never gonna be able to clear the backlog.

110
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And it feels so bad because like...

111
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Because I want to respond to all of you, you know?

112
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And sometimes it's hard.

113
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So please don't take it too personally.

114
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
If sometimes I only hard what you said,

115
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
or I don't respond,

116
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
or don't respond, I can't talk.

117
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Like I promise it's not a person.

118
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's just there's a lot, you know?

119
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And I really, really try my best

120
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
to respond to as many people as I can.

121
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But sometimes there's messages that are like a bit similar.

122
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And I feel really dumb.

123
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know if it's just my bad,

124
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
but I just feel really dumb.

125
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Like if there's like a few nice messages,

126
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
you know, they're really sweet.

127
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I feel really dumb just saying like...

128
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Thank you for like over like five times,

129
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
or like repeating myself.

130
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Because I also don't want to like come across like...

131
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Like I just respond to everyone the same way, you know?

132
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But when you get so many messages like that,

133
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
like you eventually run out of like things

134
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
or like ways to respond to them.

135
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Just know that I am always very grateful

136
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
when you send me like really kind mares

137
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
and you tell me nice things and...

138
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And yeah, so if sometimes you don't get a response

139
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
or you think I didn't see something that you send me,

140
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I guess you can always try and send it.

141
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I can't talk!

142
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Basically, you could try sending it again,

143
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
because I know like...

144
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Fuck, what was I going to say?

145
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I was like, I know that!

146
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't think I know anymore, fuck!

147
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't think I know anymore.

148
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I feel so stupid, I'm sorry.

149
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I have a pretty bad memory if you can't tell by now, so...

150
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I literally forgot what I was going to say mid-sentence.

151
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh no, it's so over.

152
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Oh no, I'm sorry.

153
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm over the place today.

154
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm like...

155
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's what I feel like right now.

156
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's what I feel like.

157
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's my problem.

158
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I feel like really hyper for some reason

159
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and happy and excited

160
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and my energy is like...

161
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah, I'm just like...

162
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
all over the place right now.

163
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm really sorry for that.

164
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Maybe that means I should stop yapping

165
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and just start gaming.

166
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Maybe that's a song that should shut up.

167
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I feel the same whenever you stream.

168
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh, that's super sweet, I'm glad.

169
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm really glad to hear that.

170
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You're gonna be on drugs?

171
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm not on drugs! What the fuck?

172
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
No, I'm sober!

173
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Unless you would describe

174
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
my OG sense as my drug, then yeah.

175
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
My misters are definitely my drug, I will say.

176
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm addicted.

177
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
If you couldn't help by now.

178
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm so sorry for being so needy today.

179
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I don't know what happened over me.

180
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I actually wanted to ask you something.

181
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry if I'm overwhelming you in any way.

182
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Initially, when I just had my debut and stuff,

184
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I didn't plan for this to happen.

185
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I didn't plan to feel so close with you this fast.

186
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
To be honest, I didn't even know

187
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
if I'm going to want to get tributes.

188
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I wasn't even sure about that.

189
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,000
To be honest, I didn't know what to expect.

190
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I didn't know what to expect.

191
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I didn't know what's going to happen

192
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
or how people are going to be with me.

193
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
When I started streaming,

194
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
every stream, each and every one of you

195
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
has been so sweet to me.

196
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Every single time.

197
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Every single time.

198
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So kind.

199
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Really amazing to me.

200
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The more days went by,

201
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
the more I felt closer and closer to you.

202
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
All of these emotions started rising up.

203
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Here we are, I guess.

204
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It kind of snowballed into it.

205
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry if it overwhelms you in any way.

206
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I didn't think that it would get like this.

207
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I wasn't expecting to feel this close

208
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and this happy with all of you here.

209
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It just snowballed into it.

210
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm sorry if it's overwhelming you in any way

211
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
or if you feel like maybe I'm being too much

212
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
or anything like that.

213
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
For that, I apologize.

214
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It just kind of happened.

215
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You're just that amazing, I guess,

216
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
is what I'm trying to say.

217
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's hard for me to award it.

218
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You've all been just so sweet to me.

219
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So kind to me, so nice to me.

220
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
How can I not feel like this?

221
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
How can I not feel like this?

222
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You've been nothing but kind to me

223
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
and sweet to me

224
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and reassuring me whenever I'm nervous.

225
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I just genuinely feel so lucky to have you.

226
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I genuinely just feel so lucky.

227
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You're all so amazing, really.

228
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I really mean it.

229
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That's why I'm feeling as close as I am with you

230
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and I am the way that I am, I guess.

231
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's all thanks to you.

232
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's all because you're amazing.

233
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And I genuinely mean it.

234
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Like I said before, I did not think

235
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
that I would do any of the stuff

236
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
that I have done the past few days.

237
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That was not in my plan.

238
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I was just going to restrain myself

239
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and have very strong boundaries

240
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
or limits and restrain myself

241
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,000
and just stick to being the big Brad 24-7

242
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You just melted my heart.

243
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I do love being a Brad sometimes

244
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
to rile you up or tease you

245
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and stuff like that.

246
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
But for the most part,

247
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
it's hard to be like,

248
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I don't know, you're just so nice to you.

249
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
How can I not be nice to you?

250
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
So I couldn't stay like a Brad 24-7

251
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
when you've all just been showing me

252
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
so much kindness and sweetness.

253
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So, yeah.

254
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Sorry about this big yapping session.

255
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I just wanted to get it out of my chest.

256
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I guess maybe it would make more sense.

257
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Maybe it won't,

258
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:37,000
but I guess I still wanted to tell you, I guess.

259
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Okay, I should probably start the game.

260
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Let me go to my other screen.

261
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Oh, fuck.

262
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I need to move, I need to move.

263
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Love's so strong, it broke the law.

264
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Okay, literally, though.

265
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Literally, though!

266
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And I feel embarrassed about it.

267
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Because I was going to stick to the Brad part

268
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
for at least a few weeks, you know?

269
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But my god, you're so sweet to me

270
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
that all it took is one or two streams

271
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and I'm head over heels in love with you.

272
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Fuck!

273
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I hate you!

274
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Stupid fucking energy, son.

275
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I hate you.

276
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
God damn it.

277
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Okay.

278
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Let me open the game.

279
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

280
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Ow!

281
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Fucking arm.

282
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Where's my steam things out?

283
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Ah!

284
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Stupid fucking mouse, holy shit.

285
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Okay.

286
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Sorry, I'm really all over the place today.

287
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
My apologies.

288
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Fuck.

289
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm so fucking cringe today.

290
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Oh my god, I'm going to get a mess.

291
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Help.

292
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Okay, let's start the game.

293
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Fuck.

294
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Fuck.

295
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
That sounds loud to me.

296
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Is it loud for you two?

297
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Fuck.

298
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Fuck.

299
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Fuck.

300
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Fuck.

301
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Fuck.

302
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Fuck.

303
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Fuck.

304
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Fuck.

305
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Fuck.

306
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Fuck.

307
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Fuck.

308
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Fuck.

309
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Fuck.

310
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It's loud for you two, hold on.

Oh no, I have no mad kids

484
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,960
I have no mad kids

485
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,960
Oh no, I'm gonna fucking die

486
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,960
Where's mad kid, please

487
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,960
Please, I need a mad kid

488
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,960
I need a mad kid

489
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
Yeah, whoa

490
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,960
Oh no, it's over for me

491
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,960
I have such low health

492
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,960
And I don't have any mad kids

493
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,960
Fuck

494
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,960
Um

495
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,960
Okay, okay, okay

496
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,960
Please, please tell me there's a mad kid

497
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,960
But I don't know, but there's a shiny

00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,960
Nice

499
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,960
We love shinies in here

500
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,960
Let's go

501
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,960
Let's go, let's go, let's go

502
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,960
Let's go, let's go

503
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,960
Okay, okay, I can do this

504
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,960
I hope they have a mad kid

505
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,960
I'm like mad kid

506
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,960

00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,960
Any mad kids in here, please tell me there's a mad kid

510
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,960
I need a mad kid

511

I need a mad kid

512
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,960
Any mad kids in here, please tell me there's a mad kid

513
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,960
This looks like an office

514
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,960
Is this where G-sound works?

515
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,960
Is this where you work?

516
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,960
Why are you...

517
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,960
Why are you shooting me?

518
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,960
What the fuck?

519
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,960
G-sound hates me

520
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,960
G-sound is trying to kill me

521
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,960
It's fucking over

522
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,960
Oh no

523
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,960
I thought you loved me

524
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,960
You said you loved me

525
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,960
Why are you shooting at me?

526
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,960
I'm fucking asshole

527
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,960
I'm in the cubicle

528
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,960
Why are you shooting me?

529
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,960
What the fuck is your problem?

530
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,960
I thought you loved me

531
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,960
Snow Bear is fucking lying to me

532
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,960
It's all a ploy

533
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,960
To get me to come to their office

534
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,960
So they can fucking shoot me

535
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,960
And kill me when I enter the office

536
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,960
It was all a ploy

537
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,960
You don't love me

538
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,960
Fuck you

539
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,960
Fuck you

540
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,960
Fucking dare you shoot at me bitch

541
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,960
Fuck off

542
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,960
You have a fucking shotgun too

543
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,960
Fuck off

544
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,960
Fuck off

545
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,960
Where is this fucking bitch

546
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,960
It hurts

547
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,960
Fuck off

548
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,960
Is it all of them?

549
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,960
Please tell me it's all of them

550
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,960
Please tell me it's all of them

551
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,960
That's right

552
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,960
There's always a way to jerk off

553
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,960
You're just not committed enough

554
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,960
You're just not committed enough

555
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,960
There's always a way to jerk off

556
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,960
You're just not committed

557
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,960
More shiny

558
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,960
Nice

559
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,960
What's in the trash?

560
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,960
Anything interesting?

561
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,960
No? Okay

562
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,960
Let's see

563
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,960
Okay

564
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,960
The Snow Berry isn't trying hard enough

565
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,960
Yeah

566
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,960
You should try hard

567
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,960
Yay

568
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,960
Come on

569
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,960
I need you

570
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,960
Wait

571
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,960
Wait

572
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,960
Nice

573
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,960
Yay I did it

574
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,960
Fuck I need one of the med kits

575
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,960
There's so many of them

576
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,960
Fuck off with the shotgun

577
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,960
And give me the med kit

578
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,960
Thank you very much

579
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,960
Nice

580
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,960
Any more shinies in here

581
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,960
I see at our work trying to liberate us

582
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,960
From R 9 to 5

583
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,960
Okay, real

584
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,960
Okay, real

585
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,960
I'm rescuing Ojisan

586
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,960
I'm rescuing Ojisan from his boring

587
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,960
Office job

588
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,960
You're welcome

589
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,960
Who else would do this for you

590
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,960
Who else would do this for you

591
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,960
That's right, nobody

592
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,960
Nobody but me

593
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,960
That's why you love me

594
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,960
Because I'm so good to you

595
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,960
No, I don't know what that means

596
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,960
But okay

597
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,960
Okay

598
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,960
I need to go here

599
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,960
Can I go here?

600
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,960
Okay

601
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,960
Yay

602
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,960
Now I put this one down

603
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,960
See, you know

604
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,960
I know what I'm doing

605
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,960
Because I'm smart

606
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,960
Smart baby

607
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,960
You didn't call I see at work

608
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,960
So she went to your office

609
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,960
Oh my god

610
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,960
Yeah, that's what just happened

611
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,960
That's what just happened

612
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,960
Are you sick?

613
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,960
I see, luckily no

614
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,960
I just constantly have this

615
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,960
Fucking way throat

616
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,960
That's so fucking annoying

617
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,960
I literally want to fucking die

618
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,960
I don't know when I drink water it happens

619
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,960
I'm probably fucking dying

620
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,960
I'm sorry

621
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,960
It's been fun

622
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,960
It's been fun Ojisan

623
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,960
But it's time for me to

624
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,960
Fucking die

625
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,960
Don't tell me what to do

626
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,960
Why are you not the one jumping

627
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,960
Are you, shut up

628
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,960
Because we'll die with I see

629
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,960
I don't know

630
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,960
I don't know if Ojisans are this committed

631
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,960
Commit

632
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,960
Committed that they would die with me

633
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,960
No, they literally fucking die

634
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,960
Literally as I say that

635
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,960
Literally as I say that I fucking die

636
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,960
What the fuck

637
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,960
Emi is correct

638
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,960
Oh wow, really

639
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,960
I didn't know

640
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,960
Ojisan is that dedicated

641
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,960
Okay, try to

642
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,960
I knew the moisture was cursed

643
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,960
Yeah, it's been fun

644
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,960
Thank you for all the love you

645
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,960
Why am I like this

646
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,960
Like this is really easy

647
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,960
Like this is really fucking easy

648
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,960
Why am I playing so badly

649
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,960
You know what, it's your fault

650
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,960
You know what Ojisan, this is your fault

651
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,960
I'm playing so bad

652
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,960
It's because you keep distracting me

653
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,960
I'm actually a really good gamer

654
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,960
But you're just distracting me right now

655
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,960
That's on you

656
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,960
Stop distracting me

657
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,960
You're making me look bad

658
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,960
Don't

659
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,960
Now we can do that

660
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,960
Come on, come on

661
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,960
Focus

662
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,960
Focus

663
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,960
Focus

664
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,960
Okay, okay, we're doing good

665
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah

666
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,960
Okay, I guess

667
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,960
I am going now

668
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,960
Why do I go now

669
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,960
I assume here, right?

670
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,960
Okay, okay

671
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,960
I'm doing good

672
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,960
Why am I supposed to go then

673
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,960
I thought that's where I'm supposed to go

674
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,960
I was so sure that's where I'm supposed to

675
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,960
Fucking go, what the fuck

676
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,960
It's so fucking over

677
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,960
I think you're supposed to jump

678
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,960
Back to the rope thingy

679
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,960
I'll try that

680
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,960
I'll try that

681
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,960
Okay, okay

682
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,960
Okay, let's do this again

683
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,960
Okay, I go here

684
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,960
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait

685
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,960
I don't trust this

686
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,960
Now

687
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,960
Now I go here

688
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,960
Okay, okay, okay

689
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,960
I love listening to icy rage

690
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,960
I'm so sorry for your ear-seeing me

691
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,960
Okay, okay

692
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,960
Now we're doing it

693
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,960
Look at me now

694
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,960
Oh fuck

695
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,960
Oh shit, I almost fell again

696
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,960
I almost

697
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,960
That scared the shit out of me

698
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,960
That fucking jump scared me

699
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,960
I don't know why that jump scared me so much

700
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,960
I really don't know

701
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,960
Fuck

702
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,960
Oh fuck, oh fuck

703
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,960
Think fast

704
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,960
Think fast

705
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,960
Think fast

706
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,960
Come on

707
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,960
Come on, think fast

708
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,960
Oh god

709
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,960
Okay

710
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,960
Okay

711
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,960
We did this

712
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,960
We're alive and well

713
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,960
I like the music

714
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,960
Oh fuck

715
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,960
I thought I could walk around and relax

716
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,960
And then these guys show up

717
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,960
Please, I just want to take a sit

718
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,960
And fucking relax

719
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,960
Fuck off

720
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,960
Let me enjoy the music

721
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,960
Blablabla

722
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,960
Oh god

723
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,960
Stop ruining the music for me

724
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,960
Stop yelling

725
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,960
Fuck off

726
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,960
I'm trying to enjoy the art

727
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,960
In this place

728
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,960
And you're really really

729
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,960
Really distracting

730
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,960
Can you open this

731
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,960
What's in here

732
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,960
No

733
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,960
I don't see it

734
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,960
I'm stupid

735
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,960
Can I click this

736
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,960
I can

737
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,960
Okay

738
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,960
Thanks

739
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,960
Okay

740
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,960
It's a big ball

741
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,960
We're balling

742
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,960
I love ball

743
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,960
Why can't I use it

744
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,960
It looks like I could move it

745
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,960
Oh

746
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,960
Okay

747
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,960
Nice

748
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,960
I'm protected by the ball

749
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,960
I'm balling

750
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,960
I'm balling

751
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,960
More balls in this game

752
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,960
Yeah, there's so many balls in this game

753
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,960
I think that's fair

754
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,960
Ball is life

755
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,960
I agree with you Amy

756
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,960
I've never heard

757
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,960
I have more true statement in my life

758
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,960
Stop

759
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,960
Fuck you

760
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,960
Fuck off

761
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,960
I'm in the gun

762
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,960
Okay, I guess I have to take the shotgun

763
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,960
Let me see shotguns

764
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,960
I'm going to use the med kit

765
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,960
I don't want to die

766
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,960
Okay, okay, let's go

767
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,960
And then

768
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,960
Look what happens

769
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,960
Okay

770
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,960
Now

771
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,960
Nice

772
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,960
Look at me go

773
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,960
I'm so

774
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,960
Fucking stop

775
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,960
Fucking asshole

776
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,960
Let me jump

777
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,960
Come on

778
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,960
Ow

779
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,960
Please

780
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,960
At least I can one shot them with the shotgun

781
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,960
That's pretty nice

782
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,960
I like that

783
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,960
I think

784
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,960
I feel like you could have done that

785
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,960
Much easier with just a bullet

786
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,960
But that was good, okay true

787
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,960
You're not wrong

788
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,960
You are not wrong

789
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,960
I didn't even think of that

790
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,960
But I think that's what the game wants you to do

791
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,960
I

792
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,960
I swear every time

793
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,960
Look at me

794
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,960
Go

795
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,960
Bang bang bang, okay literally though

796
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,960
I notice that too every time I'm like

797
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,960
Proud of myself or something that I do in the game

798
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,960
And I'm like look at me

799
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,960
I get like fucking shot at

800
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,960
I think it's a sign

801
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,960
It's a sign guys

802
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,960
It's a sign that I should not be proud of

803
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,960
Anything that I do

804
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,960
Okay and

805
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,960
Okay and

806
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,960
Okay and

807
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,960
Give me everything you've got bitch

808
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,960
In this case

809
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,960
One of your crusaders

810
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,960
Some have even said

811
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,960
Warmonger was one of your king Arthur's knights

812
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,960
I do not know

813
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,960
How the fool came by it

814
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,960
For it is clearly far older

815
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,960
Than the 11th century

816
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,960
Oh god is this a boss fight

817
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,960
Oh god this is gonna be so fucking bad

818
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,960

It's so over

824
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,960
It's so fucking over for me

825
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,960
Oh fuck

826
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,960

01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:19,960

873
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,960

874
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,960

875
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,960

876
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,960

It's so pretty here

01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,960
It's like I can almost

885
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,960
I can almost breathe the fresh air from here

886
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,960
Wow look how beautiful

887
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,960

01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,960
If anyone else fails

890
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,960
I can get into the postcard business

891
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,960
Yeah I don't think I am doing postcards

892
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,960
But that's not the business

893
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,960
You will see

894
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,960
Oh it smells stinky bruh

895
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,960

896
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,960

01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,960
No

899
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,960
I wanted to do a swan dive

900
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,960
No

901
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,960
I wanted to do a beautiful swan dive

902
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,960
From our G songs

903
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,960
No

904
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,960
It's said to jump and press F

905
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,960
That's literally what I am doing

906
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,960
Come on

907
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,960

908
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,960

912
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,960

01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,960

01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,960
Really

916
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,960
But I wanted to show off

917
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,960
Something amazing

918
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,960
I wanted you to go

919
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,960
Wow

920
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,960
But now you are like

921
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,960
Man this bitch can even swan dive

922
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,960
Shit sucks

923
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,960
Can't even impress my G songs

924
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,960
Because I can't swan dive

925
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,960
Gotta be high up

926
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,960
How high up do I need to be

927
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,960
To do the swan dive

928
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,960
How high do I need to be

929
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,960
Let me try again

930
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,960
Sorry I just really wanna do it

931
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,960
I think swan dive looks cool

932
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,960
Space jump

933
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,960
Swing

934
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,960
I don't wanna do it

935
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,960
I think swan dive looks cool

936
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,960
Space jump

937
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,960
No

938
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,960
Let me swan dive

939
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,960
I wanna be a beautiful swan

940
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,960
For G song

941
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,960
No

942
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,960
Come on

948
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,960
My last try

949
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,960
My last try

950
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,960
My last try

951
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,960
I did it

952
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,960
Yay

953
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,960

01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,960
Wow

961

I'm so happy

962
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,960
No

963
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,960
Why did I fall

964
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,960
Great job

965
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,960

I'm trying to go

974
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,960
I'm trying to go down

975
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,960
What am I doing

976
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,960
I didn't know what I'm doing

977
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,960
Sorry

978
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,960
I'm dumb

979
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,960

I really like this level

987
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,960
It looks really pretty

988
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,960
Oh no, not this guy again

989
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,960
Please fuck off

990
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,960
It's bitch

991
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,960
Oh no, not this guy again

992
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,960
Please fuck off

993
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,960
It's bitch

01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,960
Oh no

995
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,960
No

996
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,960
No

997
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,960
No

998
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,960
Don't say that

999
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,960
Don't say that

1000
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,960
Don't say that

1001
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,960
Don't say that

1002
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,960
Don't say that

1003
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,960
Don't

1004
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,960
Don't say that

1005
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,960
I'm not dumb, you're just a baby

1006
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,960
Yeah, I'm a dumb baby

1007
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,960
Oops

1008
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,960
Ah, okay

1009
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,960
I'll do this

1010
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,960
I mean, some of my OGsans

1011
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,960
would be considered pretty ancient artifacts

1012
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,960
So, OGsans

1013
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,960
You're my artifact

1014
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,960
You're my

1015
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,960
Lovely artifact

1016
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,960
That's why I love you so much

1017
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,960
I'm sorry

1018
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,960
I'm sorry

1019
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,960
I love you

1020
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,960
I didn't mean that

1021
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,960
I didn't mean that

1022
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,960
I love you, GSan

1023
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,960
I love you

1024
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,960
I was just joking

1025
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,960
I love you

1026
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,960
I love you

1027
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,960
I was just joking

1028
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,960
I didn't mean that

1029
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,960
How do I

1030
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,960
How do I crouch?

1031
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,960
Oh fuck

1032
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,960
How do I

1033
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,960
I don't remember how to crouch

1034
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,960
Will you take care of your ancient artifact?

1035
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,960
Of course

1036
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,960
Of course I would

1037
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,960
You gotta take good care of artifacts

1038
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,960
To keep them all good and nice

1039
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,960
You know

1040
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,960
I forgot how to crouch

1041
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,960
I wanna check

1042
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,960
Shall we?

1043
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,960
I have a pretty bad memory

1044
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,960
F

1045
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,960
Okay

1046
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,960
F

1047
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,960
Nice

1048
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,960
How do I

1049
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,960
How do I open this

1050
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,960
I'm probably gonna have to do something

1051
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,960
Aren't I?

1052
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,960
I need to be really fast

1053
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,960
Okay

1054
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,960
I'm definitely not

1055
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,960
Okay

1056
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,960
Okay I did it

1057
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:31,960
Fuck

1058
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,960
Ow

1059
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,960
Ow

1060
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,960
Oh god, I almost got exploded

1061
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,960
Stop it

1062
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,960
Okay, where's the rest of them?

1063
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,960
Somewhere

1064
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,960
Will you polish your artifacts

1065
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,960
Often I see?

1066
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,960
Of course

1067
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:01,960
Of course I will

1068
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,960
Can I keep you all nice and happy?

1069
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,960
I'll make sure my artifact stays nice

1070
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,960
Can I go here?

1071
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,960
Andy is trying to shoot you

1072
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,960
Okay, real

1073
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,960
How the fuck do I get up there

1074
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,960
Fuck, I'm stupid

1075
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,960
I don't know how to fucking get up there

1076
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,960
Oh, it's so over

1077
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,960
It's so over

1078
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,960
Oh, maybe like this

1079
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,960
Yeah, okay

1080
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,960
That works

1081
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,960
Yeah, die, die

1082
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,960
Nice

1083
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,960
Shiny

1084
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,960
Oh

1085
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,960
Ow

1086
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,960
I'm almost gonna fucking die again

1087
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,960
Oh no, no, no, no

1088
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,960
Fuck off

1089
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,960
Fuck off

1090
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,960
Okay, give me the gun

1091
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,960
Give me the gun, I want new guns

1092
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,960
Where's the other gun?

1093
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,960
Give me, give me, give me, give me

1094
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,960
Will my value increase with my age?

1095
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,960
Well, some men

1096
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,960
Age like fine wine

1097
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,960
So

1098
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,960
Your value could increase

1099
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,960
As you age

1100
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,960
If we're thinking that way

1101
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,960
Right?

1102
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,960
Why is this too far?

1103
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,960
I guess I go from here

1104
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,960
Okay

1105
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,960
That's so men age like milk

1106
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,960
No, not my

1107
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,960
Not my mistress

1108
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,960
All my mistress

1109
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,960
Age like fine wine

1110
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,960
The love you have for me

1111
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,960
The love you have for me

1112
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:51,960
Is what is gonna

1113
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,960
Make you age like fine wine

1114
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,960
So you're welcome

1115
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,960
I need a gun in the spot

1116
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,960
I need a gun in the spot

1117
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,960
Okay, I'm fucking stupid

1118
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,960
Wait, maybe I'm not

1119
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,960
Maybe this is the right way

1120
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,960
Wait, maybe I'm not stupid

1121
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,960
I'm spinning for like 10 fucking years

1122
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:41,960
It's all thanks to the icing aid

1123
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,960
Yeah, that's true

1124
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,960
That helps as well

1125
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,960
So make sure to drink lots of

1126
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,960
To stay nice and

1127
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,960
Fresh

1128
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,960
Fuck!

1129
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,960
Go on!

1130
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,960
Jesus Christ

1131
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,960
icing aid is our life

1132
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,960
Elixir

1133
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,960
Yes, I am

1134
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,960
That's true

1135
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,960
Okay

1136
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,960
I'll have to get these traps

1137
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,960
Moving to pass through

1138
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,960
Only you think of it that way

1139
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,960
I don't like it

1140
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,960
I don't care, shut up

1141
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,960
Oh

1142
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,960
I need to adjust myself

1143
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,960
Any adjusters?

1144
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,960
No

1145
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,960
No, no

1146
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,960
No, I don't want to do this again

1147
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,960
No, no, that was so bad

1148
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,960
That was so bad

1149
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,960
No, no, I have to do it again

1150
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,960
No, I was doing so good

1151
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,960
Fuck, now I have to do shit again

1152
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,960
Oh my fucking god

1153
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,960
I was doing so good

1154
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,960
I was like on a roll

1155
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,960
Just doing all the jumps perfectly

1156
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,960
And then I fuck up

1157
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,960
Okay

1158
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,960
Okay, gotta focus

1159
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,960
Gotta focus

1160
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,960
You can't distract me a decent

1161
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,960
I have to focus

1162
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,960
This is very important, okay

1163
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,960
Gonna have to wait

1164
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,960
Okay, I'm fucking terrified

1165
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,960
But do I assume that I need to

1166
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,960
Use the rope anyways

1167
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,960
Right

1168
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,960
Cause I need to go this way, I think

1169
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,960
Adjust

1170
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,960
When people ask us

1171
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,960
When people ask us

1172
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,960
What the secret of our youth is

1173
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:19,960
We're gonna have a hard time answering this

1174
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,960
So we'll just need to work questions

1175
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,960
Okay, that's very true

1176
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,960
That is very true

1177
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,960
No, no, no, please

1178
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,960
Please, no

1179
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,960
I almost fucking fell again, please

1180
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,960
One

1181
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,960
Okay

1182
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,960
I got a checkpoint

1183
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,960
Yay

1184
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,960
I got a checkpoint

1185
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,960
All is good

1186
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,960
I won't have to do that

1187
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,960
Jump all over again

1188
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,960
Nice

1189
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,960
Okay, I guess that's the way to go

1190
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,960
Up, up, up, up, up

1191
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,960
Upies

1192
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,960
Upies, upies

1193
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,960
Up, up, up, up, up

1194
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,960
Upies

1195
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:25,960
Upies for a little icy

1196
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,960
Yay

1197
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:29,960
I would love that

1198
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:31,960
That would be so cute

1199
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,960
Uh

1200
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,960
Let me see

1201
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,960
Oh god, he's right there

1202
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,960
Fuck

1203
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,960
No, no, no, no

1204
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,960
No hunting

1205
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,960
No hunting, I'm the hunter

1206
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,960
I'm the hunter here

1207
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,960
Oh god

1208
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,960
I'm gonna have to think

1209
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,960
I don't like thinking

1210
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,960
I don't like thinking

1211
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:07,960
I want Mr. to do all the thinking

1212
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,960
for me

1213
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,960
Can I do that for me, please?

1214
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:17,960
Oh, shiny

1215
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,960
Nice

1216
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:21,960
Wait

1217
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,960
Okay, let's see

1218
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,960
Let's see where this

1219
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,960
takes us

1220
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,960
Oh, nice

1221
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:39,960
Okay

1222
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,960
Look at me go

1223
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,960
Let me connect

1224
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,960
my one brain cell for you, IC

1225
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,960
Thank you

1226
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,960
If itch.org

1227
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,960
connects one of his brain cells

1228
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,960
I'll have so many

1229
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,960
So thank you

1230
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,960
I appreciate

1231
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,960
Is there anything like

1232
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,960
in here?

1233
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,960
No

1234
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,960
I

1235
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,960
Assume

1236
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,960
Okay, well I guess

1237
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:33,960
what I assumed was fucking wrong

1238
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:35,960
I thought I can like

1239
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:37,960
jump

1240
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:45,960
But I guess I thought wrong

1241
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,960
What the fuck though?

1242
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,960
Where am I supposed to go?

1243
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:55,960
Like it really looks to me

1244
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,960
like that's where you're supposed to go

1245
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,960
Oh wait

1246
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,960
Maybe I can jump here

1247
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:05,960
Oh wait

1248
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,960
How do I jump down?

1249
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,960
Please

1250
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:23,960
Wow

1251
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,960
Good stream

1252
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,960
Oh

1253
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,960
Look I found a shiny

1254
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,960
Okay

1255
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:37,960
That was a good

1256
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:39,960
That was like a good reason to fall

1257
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,960
Nice

1258
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,960

1264
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,960
I wonder if there's anything

1265
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,960
in here

1266
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:09,960
Can I do anything?

1267
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,960
Over here

1268
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,960
I

1269
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,960
Hmm

1270
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,960
Ooh

1271
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,960
Okay

Oh no

1277
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,960
It's getting difficult

1278
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,960
It's getting too difficult

1279
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,960
for my small brain

1280
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,960
It's getting too difficult

1281
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,960
for my small brain

1282
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,960
Where the fuck am I supposed to go now?

1283
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,960
I don't know where to go now

1284
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,960
Oh no

1285
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,960
It's so over

1286
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,960
I don't know where to go

1287
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,960

01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:27,960
Just jump back

1291
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,960
Look for other pillars

1292
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,960
where the mats will cover

1293
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,960
But I don't see any

1294
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,960

1295
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,960

1299
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,960
I don't know where to go

1300
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,960
I don't know

1301
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,960
where to go

1302
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,960
Jesus

1303
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,960
I'm gonna be stuck here forever

1304
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:13,960
and die

1305
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,960
I'm just gonna die in this fucking tomb

1306
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,960
I need help

1307
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,960

01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,960
Quick center rescue operation

1313
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:55,960
Yeah I really need that

1314
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,960
You're right back I see I believe you'll clear this

1315
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:03,960
By the time I'm back you can do it

1316
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:09,960
I don't know about that

1317

01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,960
How bad this is right now

1544
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:45,960
I

1545
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:47,960
I see rage as a blessing

1546
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:49,960
No it's not

1547
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,960
It is not a blessing

1548
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,960
It's a curse

1549
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,960
Okay

1550
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,960

Now I need to wait for this fucking thing

1554
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:17,960
To go all the way up

1555
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:19,960
Like on top of everything

1556
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,960
I need to wait for this to go up

1557
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,960
Jesus Christ

1558
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:27,960
I hate this level

1559
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:29,960

I'm waiting for this to turn to a yapp stream

1565
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:47,960
This is no longer a yapp stream

1566
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:49,960
This is a fucking rage stream

1567
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:51,960
At this point

1568
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:53,960
It's a fucking rage stream

1569
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:57,960
God fucking damn it

1570
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:01,960
I'm so scared

1571
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,960
To even fucking jump anywhere right now

1572
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,960

01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:13,960
It's gonna fucking fall again

1577
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:15,960
For like the billionth fucking time

1578
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:19,960
And it's gonna be fucking terrible

1579
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:25,960
Wait

1580
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:29,960

01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:01,960
Like I don't jump here

1588
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:03,960

I go here

1591
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:09,960
And then I go up here

1592
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:13,960
And then

1593
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:15,960
I go

1594
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,960

01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:27,960
I'm gonna fucking strangle someone

01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:29,960

Don't you love this game so much

01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:43,960
Shut up

1601
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:47,960
Shut up

1602
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:49,960

Don't tell me that

1604
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:53,960
Don't tell me those things

1605
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:55,960
I don't think I am

1606
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:57,960
You should be very careful of me right now

1607
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:01,960
You should be very careful

1608
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:03,960
With your words right now G-san

01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,960
Okay

1614
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:23,960
I don't think this is the right way

1615
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:27,960
Go here

1616
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:29,960
I want to see Dark Souls

1617
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:31,960

01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:35,960
I'm good

1620
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,960
How do you want me to play Dark Souls

1621
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:39,960
When you see how bad I am

1622
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:41,960
At this game

1623
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:43,960
How are you gonna tell me

1624
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:45,960
How are you gonna tell me to play Dark Souls

1625
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:49,960
When you see how fucking bad I am

1626
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:51,960
At this fucking game

1627
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:53,960
That's just going to be like

1628
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:55,960
A whole another level of rage

1629
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:57,960
I'm gonna like jump out the window

1630
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:59,960
From how much rage I'm gonna feel

1631
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:05,960
And Elden Ring DDLC

1632
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:07,960

01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:11,960
I'm gonna suck at that game

01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:13,960
I'm gonna fucking die the whole stream

1636
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:17,960
Why would you want to see that

1637
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:21,960
That's the content

1638
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:23,960
I mean

1639
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:25,960
You're getting it right now with this game

1640
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:29,960
I don't think it's very fun to watch

1641
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:31,960
When it keeps like repeating

1642
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:33,960
For like a hundred fucking times

1643
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:37,960
Come on

1644
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:39,960
Come on bitch please

1645
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:43,960
I'm okay

1646
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:45,960
Okay fuck this

1647
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:47,960
I'm not gonna do anything with it right now

1648
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:49,960
I'm just gonna do this

1649
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:51,960
I would be very proud if you beat Dark Souls

1650
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:55,960
Well I guess I'm a disappointment

1651
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:57,960
Because it's gonna happen

1652
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:01,960
Oh my fucking god

1653
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:09,960
Please

1654
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:13,960
I'm already dying here

1655
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:15,960
Here

1656
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:19,960
Please

1657
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:37,960
Sorry I wanted to make it look nice

1658
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:41,960
I am not going here right

1659
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:43,960
Like

1660
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:45,960
Or am I

1661
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:47,960
Am I supposed to go here or not

1662
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:49,960
I'm not sure and I'm too fucking terrified

1663
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:51,960
I see can you save right now

1664
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:53,960
Let me see

1665
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,960
Not the shooting

1666
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:03,960
Yeah okay that's good

1667
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:05,960
I can save here then

1668
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:09,960
I guess let's try and see where this takes us

1669
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:13,960
I

1670
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:17,960
Is this where I was already

1671
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:23,960
I'm fucking loading

1672
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:25,960
I'm fucking loading

1673
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:27,960
I'm not doing this shit again

1674
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:31,960
I'm dealing with that fucking thing again

1675
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:33,960
For like the billions time

1676
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,960
I'm sorry

1677
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:39,960
Okay

1678
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:43,960
At least now we know that this is not

1679
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:45,960
Where I'm supposed to go

1680
01:47:57,960 --> 01:47:59,960
Okay I guess I'm supposed to go here then

1681
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:09,960
Then go here I guess

1682
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:13,960
I

1683
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:19,960
But I need something here

1684
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:25,960
Fuck

1685
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:27,960
I need something here

1686
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:31,960
Where am I gonna get it from

1687
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:39,960
Wait we can save and load anywhere

1688
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:41,960
I guess so

1689
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:43,960
I guess we can

1690
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:45,960
I guess so

1691
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:47,960
I'm sorry I see but this is big content

1692
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:49,960
Plus adorable

1693
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:51,960
You know it's really pain

1694
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:55,960
When I'm sitting here and I'm like

1695
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:57,960
Going insane from raging

1696
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:59,960
And you go and tell me

1697
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:01,960
That this is big content

1698
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:03,960
Out of all content I make

1699
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:05,960
This is the big content

1700
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:07,960
Big content

1701
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:09,960
I am fucking dying

1702
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:17,960
God I wish I could move it

1703
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:21,960
Fuck

1704
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,960
How the fuck am I supposed to

1705
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:25,960
Like get here a thing

1706
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:27,960
Where am I supposed to get that shit from

1707
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:29,960
I should

1708
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:35,960
Oh wait

1709
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:37,960
I need to do it fast

1710
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:39,960
Oh

1711
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:41,960
Okay

1712
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:43,960
Never mind I just need it to be quick

1713
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:45,960
About it okay

1714
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,960
Fuck this stupid

1715
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:49,960
Real AGsons

1716
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:51,960
No DGIC is big content

1717
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:55,960
You know I agree

1718
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:57,960
I agree with you

1719
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:59,960
I think so too

1720
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:03,960
I have so much fun

1721
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:05,960
In the DJ streams

1722
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:07,960
But

1723
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:09,960
With that being said I did have a lot of fun

1724
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:11,960
In yesterday's ASMR stream

1725
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:13,960
As well so

1726
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:15,960
So I will say that

1727
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:17,960
But that's because you make it very fun for me

1728
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:21,960
Where do I go now

1729
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:23,960
I didn't see what it actually fucking did

1730
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:25,960
Dude distracting reading

1731
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:27,960
What you're saying to me

1732
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,960
I don't even know what it fucking did

1733
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:35,960
Help

1734
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:37,960
What did moving this thing do

1735
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:39,960
Did anyone see

1736
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:41,960
Cause I didn't see

1737
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:43,960
I was too busy reading what you're saying

1738
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:45,960
ASMR baby

1739
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:47,960
I see is my favorite

1740
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:49,960
I'm not surprised

1741
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:53,960
Well I would say

1742
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:55,960
Okay you know what you're right

1743
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:57,960
You are very right

1744
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:59,960
I don't know why I didn't think of that

1745
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:01,960
I should say that's very fucking true

1746
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:05,960
Very good at the points

1747
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:09,960
I think it added a lot of fun

1748
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:11,960
It's

1749
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:13,960
I think it added

1750
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:15,960
Water somewhere

1751
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:19,960
Okay should I jump

1752
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:25,960
I guess it added water here

1753
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:27,960
I don't think this had water before

1754
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:29,960
Right

1755
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:37,960
Yeah this definitely did not have water

1756
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:39,960
Was this supposed to be here

1757
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:43,960
Or is the current too strong

1758
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:45,960
I can't tell

1759
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:51,960
Okay is there anything here

1760
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:53,960
Am I doing here anything

1761
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:57,960
Nope nothing here

1762
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:09,960
I

1763
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:15,960
The middle behind you

1764
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:17,960
Oh no

1765
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:19,960
What's behind me

1766
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:23,960
Is it you

1767
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:25,960
Are you behind me

1768
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:29,960
Fuck

1769
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:39,960
Fuck

1770
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:45,960
Is there anything in here

1771
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:47,960
That I can do

1772
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:51,960
Wait can I go

1773
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:53,960
Wait can I go

1774
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:55,960
I'm here hold on

1775
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:57,960
Or is it just like the same fucking thing

1776
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:03,960
That's literally the same place

1777
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:05,960
That I was at I think

1778
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:07,960
This does anything

1779
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:13,960
The pillar is

1780
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:15,960
Yeah I see the glowing pillar

1781
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:17,960
But like I don't know what

1782
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:19,960
The fucking like deal with it

1783
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,960
Cause I'm really fucking stupid

1784
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:37,960
Can you use the grapple on it

1785
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:39,960
I can only use the grapple

1786
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:41,960
On like the thing

1787
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:43,960
That you can stand on

1788
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:47,960
I can only grapple

1789
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:49,960
On this thing to like move myself with

1790
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:51,960
The thing

1791
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:55,960
Man I hate this level

1792
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:01,960
This fucking level so much

1793
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:07,960
Uh

1794
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:09,960
Okay

1795
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:17,960
Fuck what

1796
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:19,960
What do I fucking do here

1797
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:21,960
Go straight

1798
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:23,960
Like straight from here

1799
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:27,960
Do you want me to go like in here

1800
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:29,960
Is that what you mean

1801
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:31,960
Or do you want me to go somewhere else

1802
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:37,960
I know what I mean

1803
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:41,960
Why do you say go straight

1804
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:43,960
Do you mean like here

1805
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:45,960
Like straight from here

1806
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:47,960
I feel so fucking stupid

1807
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:49,960
I want to like bury myself

1808
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:51,960
From embarrassed man

1809
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:59,960
There is a small cave behind you

1810
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:01,960
Here

1811
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:05,960
Wait what cave

1812
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:07,960
I'm blind

1813
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:09,960
Where is the cave

1814
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:11,960
I don't see a cave

1815
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:15,960
Are you talking about this thing

1816
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:17,960
Or something else

1817
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:19,960
I'm sorry

1818
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:21,960
I'm really stupid

1819
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:23,960
And I'm bad with directions

1820
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:25,960
And I'm bad with thinking

1821
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:31,960
Why do I

1822
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:35,960
Why do I

1823
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:43,960
Someone told me there is a cave

1824
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:45,960
But I don't see any cave

1825
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:49,960
Being all of this thing

1826
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:51,960
Is just so cute

1827
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:53,960
Does it

1828
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:57,960
Are you talking about this

1829
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:59,960
Or are you talking about

1830
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:01,960
Something different

02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:29,960
A lot of brain damage

1996
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:31,960

2023
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:11,960
Oh my god

2024
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:13,960
Huh

02:17:53,960 --> 02:17:55,960
It's the size of a fist

2223
02:17:55,960 --> 02:17:57,960
And according to Amanda's research

2224
02:17:57,960 --> 02:17:59,960
It's here

2225
02:17:59,960 --> 02:18:01,960

2226
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:03,960
Where is she

2227
02:18:05,960 --> 02:18:07,960

02:27:41,960 --> 02:27:43,960
I'm gonna go like

2414
02:27:43,960 --> 02:27:45,960
Completely fucking insane

2415
02:27:45,960 --> 02:27:47,960
Come on grapple

Bye

2420
02:27:57,960 --> 02:27:59,960
Bye

2421
02:27:59,960 --> 02:28:01,960
No I'm not

2422
02:28:01,960 --> 02:28:03,960
Clearly clearly

2423
02:28:03,960 --> 02:28:05,960
I was not ready for this

2424
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:07,960
Clearly

2425
02:28:09,960 --> 02:28:11,960
Wait wait

2426
02:28:11,960 --> 02:28:13,960
You know what I just thought about

2427
02:28:13,960 --> 02:28:15,960
Wait you know what I just thought about

2428
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:19,960
I need to use this in my sound board

2429
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:21,960
Next DJ stream

2430
02:28:21,960 --> 02:28:23,960
I need to use this as one of my sound boards

2431
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:25,960
Oh my god

2432
02:28:25,960 --> 02:28:27,960
That will be so fucking good

2433
02:28:27,960 --> 02:28:29,960
And funny

2434
02:28:29,960 --> 02:28:31,960
That will be so fucking funny

2435
02:28:31,960 --> 02:28:33,960
Oh my god

2436
02:28:33,960 --> 02:28:35,960
Hell fucking yes

2437
02:28:37,960 --> 02:28:39,960
Hell fucking yes

2438
02:28:39,960 --> 02:28:41,960
I'm definitely gonna use this as a fucking sound board

2439
02:28:41,960 --> 02:28:43,960
For next

02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:45,960

I believe I believe I'm a pro gamer

2465
02:29:41,960 --> 02:29:43,960
I'm a pro gamer

2466
02:29:43,960 --> 02:29:45,960
Number one number one gamer

2475
02:30:03,960 --> 02:30:05,960

Yo let's fucking go

2481
02:30:15,960 --> 02:30:17,960
Yes now I have the dildo to myself

2482
02:30:17,960 --> 02:30:19,960
Let's fucking go

2483
02:30:19,960 --> 02:30:21,960
Yo that's a big dildo

2484
02:30:21,960 --> 02:30:23,960
Damn that's

2485
02:30:23,960 --> 02:30:25,960
I think that's too big for me

2486
02:30:25,960 --> 02:30:27,960
I think that's too big for me

2487
02:30:29,960 --> 02:30:31,960
Pretty

2488
02:30:31,960 --> 02:30:33,960
The crusades

2489
02:30:33,960 --> 02:30:35,960
King Arthur

2490
02:30:35,960 --> 02:30:37,960
Mystery

2491
02:30:37,960 --> 02:30:39,960
Doesn't interest me

2492
02:30:39,960 --> 02:30:41,960
Well then why don't you stay here

2493
02:30:41,960 --> 02:30:43,960
Consider the future

2494
02:30:43,960 --> 02:30:45,960
I imagine you're in it however

2495
02:30:45,960 --> 02:30:47,960
You won't enjoy seeing me again

2496
02:30:47,960 --> 02:30:49,960
Your father might not have found the Galali key

2497
02:30:49,960 --> 02:30:51,960
But a man that doesn't know that

2498
02:30:51,960 --> 02:30:53,960
I don't give a fuck

2499
02:30:55,960 --> 02:30:57,960
You better have good insurance

2500
02:30:57,960 --> 02:30:59,960
I

2501
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:01,960
My insurance is

2502
02:31:01,960 --> 02:31:03,960
Could be better

2503
02:31:07,960 --> 02:31:09,960
Please tell me this is the only level

2504
02:31:23,960 --> 02:31:25,960
Not I

2505
02:31:25,960 --> 02:31:27,960
I said

2506
02:31:27,960 --> 02:31:29,960
I mean did you see that thing

2507
02:31:29,960 --> 02:31:31,960
That thing was fucking enormous

2508
02:31:37,960 --> 02:31:39,960
Yes

2509
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:43,960
Please um please no

2510
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:45,960
I'm good

2511
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:47,960
I'm good

2512
02:31:47,960 --> 02:31:49,960
You know I'm good

2513
02:31:49,960 --> 02:31:51,960
I'm good

2514
02:31:51,960 --> 02:31:53,960
I'm good okay

2515
02:31:53,960 --> 02:31:55,960
I

2516
02:31:55,960 --> 02:31:57,960
I've had enough of this game for today

2517
02:31:57,960 --> 02:31:59,960
I'm good

2518
02:32:05,960 --> 02:32:07,960
Did you save

2519
02:32:07,960 --> 02:32:09,960
When you get to a new level

2520
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:11,960
It automatically saves it

2521
02:32:11,960 --> 02:32:13,960
Can't wait for part 3 already

2522
02:32:13,960 --> 02:32:15,960
Yeah

2523
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:17,960
Can't say the same

2524
02:32:17,960 --> 02:32:19,960
She wants out

2525
02:32:19,960 --> 02:32:21,960
I do want to finish the game

2526
02:32:21,960 --> 02:32:23,960
But this level was like

2527
02:32:23,960 --> 02:32:25,960
Something else

2528
02:32:25,960 --> 02:32:27,960
Just fucking insanity

2529
02:32:27,960 --> 02:32:29,960
What she was ridiculous

2530
02:32:29,960 --> 02:32:31,960
You did good I see

2531
02:32:31,960 --> 02:32:33,960
I don't know about that but thank you

2532
02:32:33,960 --> 02:32:35,960
I couldn't have done it without your help

2533
02:32:35,960 --> 02:32:37,960
I couldn't have done it without your help

2534
02:32:37,960 --> 02:32:39,960
You helped me so much

2535
02:32:45,960 --> 02:32:47,960
Amazing today thank you

2536
02:32:47,960 --> 02:32:49,960
Maybe next time it will be easy

2537
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:53,960
God I fucking hope so

2538
02:32:53,960 --> 02:32:55,960
I hope it will be easier than

2539
02:32:55,960 --> 02:32:57,960
Than this one

2540
02:32:57,960 --> 02:32:59,960
You were not ready for this

2541
02:32:59,960 --> 02:33:01,960
I literally wasn't

2542
02:33:01,960 --> 02:33:03,960
I really wasn't ready for this

2543
02:33:03,960 --> 02:33:05,960
But

2544
02:33:05,960 --> 02:33:07,960
It will make for a really fucking funny

2545
02:33:07,960 --> 02:33:09,960
Sounds in my DJ stream

2546
02:33:09,960 --> 02:33:11,960
So I am definitely gonna

2547
02:33:11,960 --> 02:33:13,960
Make sure to write a note

2548
02:33:13,960 --> 02:33:15,960
So that I don't forget to do that

2549
02:33:15,960 --> 02:33:17,960
Next DJ stream

2550
02:33:17,960 --> 02:33:19,960
You will hear that shit

2551
02:33:19,960 --> 02:33:21,960
You are gonna hear

2552
02:33:21,960 --> 02:33:23,960
Igor

2553
02:33:23,960 --> 02:33:25,960
And you are gonna hear this motherfucker as well

2554
02:33:25,960 --> 02:33:27,960
You bet you wish you could do that

2555
02:33:29,960 --> 02:33:31,960
You bet you wish you could do that

2556
02:33:33,960 --> 02:33:35,960
It's gonna be so fucking funny

2557
02:33:35,960 --> 02:33:37,960
I can't wait to do another DJ stream

2558
02:33:37,960 --> 02:33:39,960
I am still trying to figure out

2559
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:41,960
When I should do it

2560
02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:43,960
Cause like this Saturday

2561
02:33:43,960 --> 02:33:45,960
We do like

2562
02:33:45,960 --> 02:33:47,960
The karaoke

2563
02:33:47,960 --> 02:33:49,960
And watch along

2564
02:33:49,960 --> 02:33:51,960
So

2565
02:33:51,960 --> 02:33:53,960
I wonder if maybe the Saturday

2566
02:33:53,960 --> 02:33:55,960
After that

2567
02:33:55,960 --> 02:33:57,960
I should do another DJ stream

2568
02:34:01,960 --> 02:34:03,960
Much to think about

2569
02:34:03,960 --> 02:34:05,960
Why not every weekend

2570
02:34:05,960 --> 02:34:07,960
Because I'd rather not

2571
02:34:07,960 --> 02:34:09,960
Not get drunk every weekend

2572
02:34:11,960 --> 02:34:13,960
And when I DJ

2573
02:34:13,960 --> 02:34:15,960
I need to drink at least a bit

2574
02:34:15,960 --> 02:34:17,960
You know

2575
02:34:17,960 --> 02:34:19,960
To get into the groove of things

2576
02:34:23,960 --> 02:34:25,960
And I mean

2577
02:34:25,960 --> 02:34:27,960
I'll see

2578
02:34:27,960 --> 02:34:29,960
If I see that

2579
02:34:29,960 --> 02:34:31,960
You really really really love my DJ streams

2580
02:34:33,960 --> 02:34:35,960
I might consider doing it

2581
02:34:35,960 --> 02:34:37,960
Every Saturday

2582
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:39,960
Like every weekend

2583
02:34:39,960 --> 02:34:41,960
I might

2584
02:34:41,960 --> 02:34:43,960
But

2585
02:34:43,960 --> 02:34:45,960
I don't know

2586
02:34:45,960 --> 02:34:47,960
I don't know

2587
02:34:47,960 --> 02:34:49,960
We'll see

2588
02:34:49,960 --> 02:34:51,960
Your stream was awesome

2589
02:34:51,960 --> 02:34:53,960
Yeah, I had a blast

2590
02:34:53,960 --> 02:34:55,960
Honestly

2591
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:57,960
With that being said

2592
02:34:57,960 --> 02:34:59,960
After all of this chaos

2593
02:34:59,960 --> 02:35:01,960
And rage

2594
02:35:01,960 --> 02:35:03,960
I hope you're ready to relax

2595
02:35:03,960 --> 02:35:05,960
With Strani

2596
02:35:05,960 --> 02:35:07,960
I think she's doing

2597
02:35:07,960 --> 02:35:09,960
SMR right now

2598
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:11,960
If I'm not wrong

2599
02:35:11,960 --> 02:35:13,960
You are relaxed

2600
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:15,960
And

2601
02:35:15,960 --> 02:35:17,960
Not think about

2602
02:35:17,960 --> 02:35:19,960
I wish you could do that

2603
02:35:19,960 --> 02:35:21,960
Every two weeks seems good

2604
02:35:21,960 --> 02:35:23,960
Yeah, that's what I was thinking

2605
02:35:23,960 --> 02:35:25,960
I was thinking every other week

2606
02:35:25,960 --> 02:35:27,960
So that would be like

2607
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:29,960
Twice a month

2608
02:35:29,960 --> 02:35:31,960
I think

2609
02:35:31,960 --> 02:35:33,960
If I'm counting correctly

2610
02:35:37,960 --> 02:35:39,960
Relax after laughing your asses off

2611
02:35:39,960 --> 02:35:41,960
Yeah

2612
02:35:41,960 --> 02:35:43,960
You just spent all your energy laughing

2613
02:35:43,960 --> 02:35:45,960
And now you can just, you know, relax

2614
02:35:51,960 --> 02:35:53,960
Twice a month seems fun

2615
02:35:53,960 --> 02:35:55,960
Yeah, I think twice a month would be pretty good

2616
02:35:59,960 --> 02:36:01,960
I am thankful

2617
02:36:03,960 --> 02:36:05,960
I can't fucking talk

2618
02:36:05,960 --> 02:36:07,960
I am thankful for your help

2619
02:36:07,960 --> 02:36:09,960
Throughout me playing it

2620
02:36:09,960 --> 02:36:11,960
Because I think

2621
02:36:11,960 --> 02:36:13,960
I would have spent much more time

2622
02:36:13,960 --> 02:36:15,960
Playing this fucking level

2623
02:36:15,960 --> 02:36:17,960
If it wasn't for your help

2624
02:36:17,960 --> 02:36:19,960
So I do

2625
02:36:19,960 --> 02:36:21,960
I do appreciate it

2626
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:23,960
Very much

2627
02:36:23,960 --> 02:36:25,960
What the heck

2628
02:36:25,960 --> 02:36:27,960
Oh jeez that time

2629
02:36:27,960 --> 02:36:29,960
What the heck

2630
02:36:29,960 --> 02:36:31,960
Thank you so much for the donation

2631
02:36:31,960 --> 02:36:33,960
Thank you

2632
02:36:33,960 --> 02:36:35,960
Hold on, let me thank everyone

2633
02:36:35,960 --> 02:36:37,960
Before I go

2634
02:36:37,960 --> 02:36:39,960
Because I keep forgetting

2635
02:36:39,960 --> 02:36:41,960
Data hopes

2636
02:36:41,960 --> 02:36:43,960
You get yourself something nice after all that pain

2637
02:36:43,960 --> 02:36:45,960
Thank you

2638
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:47,960
That's so nice of you

2639
02:36:47,960 --> 02:36:49,960
I love you, thank you

2640
02:36:49,960 --> 02:36:51,960
Thank you for the $50 donation

2641
02:36:51,960 --> 02:36:53,960
That's really sweet of you

2642
02:36:53,960 --> 02:36:55,960
I appreciate it

2643
02:36:55,960 --> 02:36:57,960
Thank you so much, that's really sweet of you

2644
02:36:57,960 --> 02:36:59,960
You didn't have to do that

2645
02:36:59,960 --> 02:37:01,960
And

2646
02:37:01,960 --> 02:37:03,960
Thank you for the $6 donation

2647
02:37:03,960 --> 02:37:05,960
Sweet and awkward

2648
02:37:05,960 --> 02:37:07,960
Cob is precious

2649
02:37:07,960 --> 02:37:09,960
Thank you

2650
02:37:09,960 --> 02:37:11,960
I'm glad you think so

2651
02:37:11,960 --> 02:37:13,960
I know this is gonna probably sound really weird

2652
02:37:15,960 --> 02:37:17,960
But I did have fun

2653
02:37:17,960 --> 02:37:19,960
I was raging a lot

2654
02:37:19,960 --> 02:37:21,960
And the game pissed me off a lot

2655
02:37:21,960 --> 02:37:23,960
But sharing this experience

2656
02:37:23,960 --> 02:37:25,960
With you is what was fun

2657
02:37:25,960 --> 02:37:27,960
Reading what you say

2658
02:37:27,960 --> 02:37:29,960
And you making me laugh

2659
02:37:29,960 --> 02:37:31,960
And you helping me

2660
02:37:31,960 --> 02:37:33,960
And doing all that stuff

2661
02:37:33,960 --> 02:37:35,960
That was a really fun part

2662
02:37:35,960 --> 02:37:37,960
For me

2663
02:37:37,960 --> 02:37:39,960
So I did have fun

2664
02:37:39,960 --> 02:37:41,960
Even if I was raging

2665
02:37:41,960 --> 02:37:43,960
A lot

2666
02:37:47,960 --> 02:37:49,960
What's tomorrow

2667
02:37:51,960 --> 02:37:53,960
Tomorrow is Thursday

2668
02:37:53,960 --> 02:37:55,960
I think tomorrow, if I'm not wrong

2669
02:37:55,960 --> 02:37:57,960
Is the group collab

2670
02:37:57,960 --> 02:37:59,960
Right

2671
02:37:59,960 --> 02:38:01,960
I think so

2672
02:38:01,960 --> 02:38:03,960
If I'm not wrong

2673
02:38:03,960 --> 02:38:05,960
Tomorrow is supposed to be the power wash group collab

2674
02:38:07,960 --> 02:38:09,960
Let me check

2675
02:38:15,960 --> 02:38:17,960
Yeah, I was right

2676
02:38:17,960 --> 02:38:19,960
I was right

2677
02:38:19,960 --> 02:38:21,960
Tomorrow

2678
02:38:21,960 --> 02:38:23,960

2679
02:38:23,960 --> 02:38:25,960

2680
02:38:25,960 --> 02:38:27,960

2681
02:38:27,960 --> 02:38:29,960
We'll all be streaming

2682
02:38:29,960 --> 02:38:31,960

02:38:35,960 --> 02:38:37,960

02:38:37,960 --> 02:38:39,960
And see what we'll do

2687
02:38:39,960 --> 02:38:41,960
But yeah, tomorrow is supposed to be a really fun

2688
