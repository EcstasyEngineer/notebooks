Thank you for watching, bye!

14
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Hello, my sweet and lovely Snow Berries.

15
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hello, hello, hello.

16
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I hope you're doing well today.

17
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And if for some reason you're not doing all that great, that's okay.

18
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's what I mean if what.

19
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I missed you.

20
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's really good to see all of you here.

21
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Thank you for always keeping me company.

22
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's very sweet.

23
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm glad the feeling is mutual.

24
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I just wanted to say in advance that last stream I had my big window closed.

25
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And today I have it open so that it won't get too hard, too hot.

26
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I can't talk.

27
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So it won't get too hot in my room.

28
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
However, with that being said, if it's too loud or too distracting,

29
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
please tell me I want to get upset and I will close the big window.

30
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Because you can literally sometimes hear people walking outside.

31
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's crazy.

32
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This microphone literally picks up everything.

33
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So please do tell me if it ever gets too loud or too annoying.

34
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Because I want the ASMR to be as comfy as it can be.

35
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah.

36
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Also, I saw a comment on my last ASMR thought that

37
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
they don't know if I do this intentionally or not.

38
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That I usually focus a lot on one ear and if it was intentional.

39
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So the answer is no, it's not intentional.

40
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I generally just forget to switch between the ears.

41
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So if you ever feel that I talk for too long in one ear,

42
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
don't hesitate to remind me to switch between them.

43
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So that I can make the experience better for you.

44
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay.

45
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You have all been so kind and sweet to me.

46
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's been really overwhelming, but not in a bad way.

47
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Like in a good way, but still overwhelming.

48
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So it's something that I'll have to get used to.

49
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I guess it's very new to me.

50
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But I don't want to say that I appreciate it so much.

51
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You've all been so sweet and kind to me.

52
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And there's really not enough words to express.

53
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Just, I don't know, just so much.

54
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I appreciate it.

55
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Thank you. You're being all just too kind to me.

56
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't know what I did to deserve such nice treatment from you, but

57
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm glad that you think I'm worth it either way.

58
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Lots of emotions for a little cutie.

59
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah, I feel my emotions very strongly.

60
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So I apologize if sometimes the things I say sound weird,

61
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
or we're like, I'm yapping too much.

62
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I feel like I've been yapping way too much today.

63
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But at the same time, just I can help it.

64
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I really want you all to know just how much it means to me.

65
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But if you like, no matter how many things I write or say,

66
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:07,000
it's never going to really be enough to truly describe how I feel about all of this.

67
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Thank you.

68
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I did love you, Ozzy. Good job, yapping too much.

69
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Thank you. How's it going, sir?

70
00:12:44,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I brought some, you stopped today, some additional triggers that I think

71
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
could sound potentially good for today's stream.

72
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So one of the things that I brought is a cat toy that I have,

73
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and it makes some really, really nice crinkly sounds.

74
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And I really enjoy sounds like that, so I thought,

75
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
well, how did I not think about last stream?

76
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Let's make some nice sounds with it.

77
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Here.

78
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.

79
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.

80
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You have a cat. I have two cats.

81
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah, I have two cats.

82
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.

83
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Crinkle.

84
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Crinkle.

85
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Crinkle.

86
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.

87
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What are your cat's names if you don't mind me asking?

88
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
One of them is Bucklush.

89
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And the second one is Potato.

90
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Bucklush has been really whiny and needy today.

91
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Like, I initially closed the door and he was like

92
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
moving with his paws and like whining and stuff.

93
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But he's okay now.

94
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He's just super whiny.

95
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So I don't want him to be super loud and whiny in your ears.

96
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He's a very good boy.

97
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But really whiny and vocal, but super cute.

98
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And Potato is really tiny and she is this cute funny little gremlin.

99
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
They're both really cute gremlins. I love them both.

100
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:49,000
This toy also has a soft texture on top of it.

101
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So when I move it against your ears like this,

102
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
it can cause fun. It feels soft against the ear.

103
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

104
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,160
oh

105
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:55,160
okay

106
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,660
was never interested in ASMR

107
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,160
but you make it so comfy

108
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,160
ah, thank you

109
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
I'm flattered

110
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,000

That's how Mr. makes me feel.

166
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,040
How are these days, by the way? Are you doing fine?

167
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,040
I'm doing more than fine, I'm doing amazing, to be honest.

168
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,040
It's been just one week, but it was the best week ever.

169
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:12,040
I don't know, it's been so crazy, but every day has been genuinely just so great.

170
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
I'm sorry, I apologize.

171
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,040
I'm sorry.

172
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,040
I remember how nervous you were before the video.

173
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,040
Yeah, I was extremely nervous.

174
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:05,040
When I was done with the video, I was legitimately shaking.

175
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,040
My whole body was buzzing and shaking.

176
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

177
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:06,040
I'm glad you're here, I'm glad to be here.

178
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,040
I'm very happy to be here, and I feel very lucky.

179
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,040
I feel very lucky too.

180
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,040
I feel so lucky that it's only been a weekend.

181
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:28,040
I already have so many nice and kind people here with me.

182
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,040
I don't know, it feels so real, it feels like a dream.

183
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,040
But it's a dream that became a reality.

184
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:48,040
It's like that one meme that I saw before I joined the L.R.

185
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:58,040
And it was like, a girl wakes up one day and realizes she's living her dream.

186
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:07,040
And that's how I feel, I wake up and I'm like, wow, my dream is amazing.

187
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,040
My reality, that's so magical, you know.

188
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,040
I think it's just so cool.

189
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Let me play around with some other triggers.

190
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:44,040
It's like a bunch of paper strings or something like that.

191
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,040
So I thought maybe I could try making some sounds with it.

192
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
Rather variety.

193
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,040
Some of them are falling out of my hand.

194
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:05,040
That's probably gonna make a mess, but it's okay.

195
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,040
As long as it makes nice sounds.

196
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
Hopefully it does.

197
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,040
I love it when you say mister.

198
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:39,040
It can help that my mister's are so kind to me and so loving.

199
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
Love you mister.

200
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:19,040
Yeah, this is one of the new triggers, yeah, it is.

201
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:52,040
Sometimes I feel self-conscious about being older, but you still like me.

202
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Of course I like you, what do you mean?

203
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
What do you mean, of course?

204
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,040
And I mean, being older is not a bad thing, I think.

205
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,040
I think that's a nice thing, if anything.

206
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:15,040
I think being older does add to it in some ways.

207
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:23,040
But I think it's also about the way your soul is.

208
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:32,040
Your age could be maybe not older or anything, but you have an old soul, if that makes sense.

209
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:39,040
So in either scenario, it works.

210
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,040
I love all my mister's.

211
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,040
Okay.

212
00:32:47,040 --> 00:33:12,040
As for the tip that you just mentioned that I missed,

213
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:20,040
I always read any donations or tips at the end of every stream.

214
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:26,040
So I will do that towards the end of the stream, don't worry.

215
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,040
I love you mister.

216
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:56,040
If the spring's a love for me, then I'm gonna put them back for now.

217
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,040
Nice spring's everywhere.

218
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Thank you.

219
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,040
Let me see my comfort rate.

220
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:21,040
I'm not in the next comfort right now.

221
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,040
Those cables are everywhere.

222
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:43,040
They have two stones or minerals, whatever you wanna call them.

223
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,040
I thought that they would make for nice sounds.

224
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,040
One of them is blue and the other one is green.

225
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,040
I don't remember what their names are.

226
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
I'm too down to remember.

227
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,040
My memory is pretty bad.

228
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:13,040
But I hope you will like the sounds that they make together.

229
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,040
Thank you.

230
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,040
Thank you.

231
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,040
Thank you.

232
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:55,040
Do you really make me crave for cuddles that way?

233
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,040
Here I'm gonna get some hugs and cuddles today.

234
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,040
Just like last week.

235
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
Sorry for muting.

236
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,040
My throat felt scratchy and I had to cough.

237
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:05,040
No worries, I'm not sick.

238
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:11,040
My throat just felt itchy or scratchy for some reason.

239
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,040
So I had to cough it up basically.

240
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
I'm glad you do.

241
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:33,040
Don't hesitate to ask for previous triggers that I have already done during this stream.

242
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,040
If you want to hear more of them, that's completely fine.

243
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,040
Thank you very much.

244
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:26,040
Can I bring back the tippy tabs?

245
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,040
Yes, we can definitely do that.

you're safe here with me

gotta do what you gotta do

259
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,020
if you misbehave, I must use the buzzer

260
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,020
and the police will be looking for you

261
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,020
so if you hear police in the background

262
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,020
you know why

263
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:39,020
they're looking for misbehaving snow bears

Can I get a verse again?

317
00:46:40,820 --> 00:47:10,820
I don't blame you, this has been me, like every day, like I feel butterflies somewhat lately with just how loving and sweet mister is to me, I admit sometimes there's moments where like even one

318
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:39,820
to maybe call you Dada or you know other stuff but I guess really embarrassed about it and shy and I also don't want to make it weird so for now I just stick to ojizan and mister and you know snow pairing but sometimes I have like I just do all you boy other stuff too but

319
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:57,820
I hold myself back because I get really shy and embarrassed so maybe at some point I will but I'm really embarrassed right now

320
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:17,820
for now it's gonna be like this but I just wanted to tell you about it just to you know let it out and tell you how I felt

321
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:43,820
is there any pet names you like, like cutie or kitten or darling?

322
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:55,820
I really like just having the word little at it so let me like little icy, it's cute

323
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,820
I think it's cute doesn't it?

324
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:01,820
just um

325
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,820
oh god

326
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:18,820
I feel that's like one of my big favorites, darling is good as well, darling is cute too

327
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,820
or baby icy

328
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:34,820
I don't know why I just embarrassed about it but I'm like all blushing right now

329
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,820
icy little boys, it's really cute

330
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:55,820
it's really cute

331
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:08,820
you're my baby darling

332
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,820
that's really cute

333
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:20,820
so I'm getting really flustered

334
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:32,820
I have a small box here and it has something in it but

335
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:42,820
but I don't know if I should do anything about it

336
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,820
but it's really cute

337
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:53,820
I have a small box here and it has something in it

338
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:54,820
but

339
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:05,820
but I don't know if I should do any like triggers or anything with it

340
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,820
I feel embarrassed

341
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,820
but can you guess what it is?

342
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:19,820
what's in the box?

343
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,820
what's in the box?

344
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:39,820
is it toy?

345
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:44,820
not necessarily no, I wouldn't really say it's a toy no

346
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,820
yes, a best find

347
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:52,820
how did you know?

348
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,820
how did you know what the egg?

349
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:08,820
it has a really cute pacifier that one of my masters got me from the farm

350
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:16,820
so I've been wondering if I should use it as a striker or something like that

351
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:23,820
but I don't know if that would be like really weird or if it's, I don't know

352
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,820
I just feel really shy the best

353
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,820
ah

354
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:44,820
I already said no, I'm sorry

355
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,820
but I'm shy

356
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:51,820
I really am embarrassed

357
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,820
I don't know

358
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,820
I don't know

359
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:06,820
it would be funny if I have the best seat and I try to talk

360
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,820
I think that would be funny

361
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,820
without opening it

362
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,820
it's not a way to make it weird

363
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,820
but I'm sorry ok, I'm really embarrassed

364
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,820
I don't know, I'm so embarrassed

365
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,820
I don't know

366
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,820
oh, it's so cute though

367
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:34,820
it's so cute though

368
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:41,820
it has a moon and a polar bear with a heart and ribbons

369
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,820
and it is cute on it

370
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,820
and it has like a candy

371
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,820
like stuff and like

372
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:55,820
like lots of like shiny sparkly things on it

373
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:00,820
and it's really really cute

374
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,820
I really love the way that it looks, it's so freaking cute

375
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:22,820
ah

376
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:35,820
I'm kinda wondering if I could maybe

377
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,820
actually like take a picture of it

378
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,820
and then cut it out

379
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:45,820
and use it like as an on-stream asset

380
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:51,820
basically have it used on my model as well

381
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,820
I think that would be really cute

382
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,820
and more immersive maybe

383
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,820
I don't know

384
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:11,820
like a toggle, yeah, something like that

00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,820

But my memory is so bad.

01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

489
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

490
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

491
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

492
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

493
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I remember when I heard this trigger for the first time that someone was scratching against the radio mic.

494
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I felt so many details. It was crazy.

495
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:55,000
It really sucks how rarely I get tingles now.

496
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:07,000
In the first year or two that I got into ASMR, I got tingles so often and so much of it.

497
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
But it's really rare now.

498
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Can I try saying coconut?

499
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Okay.

500
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Coconut.

501
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Coconut.

502
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Coconut.

503
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Yeah, you just said that the sun is nice.

504
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Yeah, it's sad really.

505
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I still get tingles here and there but it's rare and it makes me sad.

506
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Because it feels so nice.

507
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Oh, I know. Maybe this will make a good sound. It's like a sticker.

508
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Oh, I know. Maybe this will make a good sound. It's like a sticker.

509
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Or maybe not. Maybe I'm just stupid.

510
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I don't know if that sounds good or not. I can't tell.

511
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:23,000
It's so cute with these tumbles over her words.

512
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:31,000
It's almost just really hard for her to say no.

513
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Okay, how are we feeling about this sticker trigger?

514
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Is it any good? Or is it like, man, whatever?

515
01:09:47,000 --> 01:10:03,000
It's like, man, I wish it was more sticky.

516
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Maybe mister can help me make this sticker more sticky.

517
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:37,000
What about this sound?

518
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Is this any good?

519
01:10:51,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I don't know where it pleases you but I want to please mister. That's important.

520
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Maybe with some kind of tape.

521
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:15,000
There are bits to gear. I would try that.

522
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Okay, let's start with the other ear.

523
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I don't know if I can see them better.

524
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
We are not decent anymore, mister. You're both.

525
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:55,000
It just depends on what I feel like calling you in the moment.

526
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:01,000
That's really weird. I feel like this sticker doesn't really stick much in this ear.

527
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Because it sounded a lot better in the other ear. More sticky.

528
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I think it is a spaghetti. Spaghetti. Spaghetti.

529
01:12:43,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I don't think I feel safe putting this sticker anywhere near my skin if you know what I mean.

530
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Okay, let's start with the other ear.

531
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Okay, let's start with the other ear.

532
01:13:43,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Okay, let's start with the other ear.

533
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Okay, let's start with the other ear.

534
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Okay.

535
01:14:47,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Okay.

536
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Yes, yes, yes.

537
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Okay, let's start with the other ear.

538
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Yes, yes, yes.

539
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Yes, yes, yes.

540
01:16:45,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I love you.

541
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I had bubble wrap like a few weeks ago, but I don't have it anymore.

542
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:43,000
But I promise whenever I do get bubble wrap in any of my packages, I'll be sure to save it and use it as a trigger for my ASMR streams.

543
01:17:43,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Yes, yes, yes.

544
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Yes, yes, yes.

545
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Yes, yes, yes.

546
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I'm going to do a little bit of sniffing since I did the last stream as well.

547
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Sniffing.

548
01:19:41,000 --> 01:20:09,000
What is sniffing so happily? You, of course, silly.

549
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Sniffing.

550
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:43,000
The smell of a snow fairy. My favorite.

551
01:20:43,000 --> 01:21:09,000
You stink very nice.

552
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
My favorite smell.

553
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Sniffing.

554
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Sniffing.

555
01:21:45,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Sniffing.

556
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Sniffing.

557
01:22:33,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Sniffing.

558
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Sniffing.

559
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Sniffing.

560
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Sniffing.

561
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Sniffing.

562
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Sniffing.

563
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Let me give you a hug. I think you deserve a nice warm hug. Come here.

564
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Come here, my beloved. You deserve some nice nice hugs to get you feel relaxed and loved and nice.

565
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Sniffing.

566
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:21,000
I love you, snow fairy. So, so much.

567
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:45,000
You deserve all the hugs in the world. You deserve to get some nice warm cuddles after a hard day of work.

568
01:25:45,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Snow fairy has been working so hard for me. It's so sweet, aren't you? The sweetest in the world. I love you so, so much.

569
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I love you.

570
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:45,000
It feels nice cuddling you like this. So nice and comfy.

571
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Wishing I could clone herself like she tweeted so I could have icy hugs for real. We all need an icy. I feel the same.

572
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:11,000
It makes me sad when I think about it too deeply. I try not to overthink it, but I don't know. I gotta help with it today.

573
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:25,000
And I just felt like really sad and was like, man, if I could clone myself for this reason, I would.

574
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Would you cuddle with your clone self? No, that would be weird.

575
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Would you make us happy if that's all that matters? Yeah, but I want to make you even happier, you know?

576
01:27:51,000 --> 01:28:07,000
And I think about it like, I still feel like I want to be able to make you happier, but like I also, I don't know, just makes me a little sad, I guess.

577
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:19,000
But I should stop thinking about it and enjoy what we have.

578
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:25,000
That question would you cuddle with your model if it was real?

579
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I don't know how to answer this question because my model is me, you know? Like I see is me and I am icy, you know?

580
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:57,000
So, I don't even know how to answer this question because it's literally me. It's literally me, so like, I don't know how to answer it.

581
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I think we already are happy. Then offer to yourself for a sake, okay? I'll try. I'll try.

582
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I'll offer my best to you to make you as happy as I can within my ability.

583
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Have you enjoyed that nice cuddle we had? I know I did.

584
01:29:46,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Let's stay out with you, Rocky, during the stream. I mean, then do you...

585
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:25,000
As always. Like I said, during summer, when it's hot, I just wear panties. That's it.

586
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:34,000
What color?

587
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:44,000
I posted it on my old Twitter, actually. A picture of the panties. I posted it on my old Twitter.

588
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Some of you probably have seen it. Nothing else. Yeah, nothing else.

589
01:30:50,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I feel like that's normal for me, anyways. Like, it's summer, but while they wear anything else, I'm in my own space, I'm not outside or anything.

590
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I'm not gonna get a cold, the weather is hot.

591
01:31:35,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I don't wear socks around. I wear slippers. Have, like, really cute reindeer slippers that I wear around the house. They very soft and comfy to wear.

592
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Let me know what you think of this sound. Is it any good or not?

593
01:32:35,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Yeah, it's good.

594
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I feel like I really need some time to establish myself and get into the growth of things, especially now that I'm overwhelmed with all the support and attention I've been getting in the future.

595
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Maybe, I don't know, it might happen if it depends how I feel a while from now.

596
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Can we get some cows later? Yeah, yeah, of course, definitely.

597
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I don't feel pressured to do anything you're not ready for. Yeah, thank you for understanding. I definitely only want to do stuff that I feel comfortable doing.

598
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:23,000
But, you know, it doesn't mean it will never happen. Like, there's always the possibility that something's gonna happen. You live and you see what happens.

599
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Wait, Ben, there's only no bra. I don't need a bra.

600
01:34:53,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra.

601
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:47,000
I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra.

602
01:35:47,000 --> 01:36:00,000
As I plan to be an ASMR tomorrow as well or on Thursday tomorrow, there will be another ASMR stream tomorrow as well. Back to back.

603
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:46,000
ASMR. Thank you.

604
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:52,000
I just sleep in bed naked. No, not fully naked. Just with my panties.

605
01:36:52,000 --> 01:37:10,000
But yeah, I feel like ASMR streams are definitely very nice for the days where I don't really feel like playing anything, you know?

606
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:27,000
And I just want to in bed and just relax together with you and just be comfy together, comfy quality. I can't talk. Comfy, quality time together.

607
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I see do you play any instruments? No, I don't. I used to have a kalimba, a small one.

608
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:59,000
And I used to use a Disney smart trigger and play it sometimes, but I never played any actual songs or anything like that.

609
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:18,000
I just randomly pressed it in whatever sounded good to me, I guess. I freestyled the kalimba because that's how I enjoyed doing it the most.

610
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:45,000
What's your favorite ASMR trigger? I actually really love visual ASMR triggers, so I really enjoy triggers where there's like hand movements or bright lights and stuff like that.

611
01:38:45,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Combined with whispers, there's something really calming about it. I just used to play piano. Oh, that's so cool. That's really nice.

612
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:15,000
That makes me think of a memory that I have. I remember when I was a little younger, I had a friend and me and her would sometimes go to the mall together.

613
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:31,000
And the mall had this big piano store. And in the piano store, they had actually headphones plugged into the piano so you could sit and play it.

614
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:51,000
And obviously, I don't know how to play the piano, but I would sometimes go to that store, sit and just make up my own melodies for like a while.

615
01:39:52,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Sometimes I would sit there for like 20 minutes or something because it was just like a really fun thing to do.

616
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Sculpt massage is 10 out of 10. Actually, I think I might be able to do a sculpt massage. I have a wig, so I think if I put the wig on the 3DO and I scratched the top of it, maybe it would feel or sound like head scratches.

617
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I would say I hope so.

618
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Maybe you just will have to pick a piano again, learn a song for you.

619
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Oh, that's so sweet. That's really sweet.

620
01:40:53,000 --> 01:41:03,000
I don't know why it makes me want to peer up, but I think that's really sweet. Thank you.

621
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Can you try hair brushing with it, too? It's such a very trigger brush, so comfy.

622
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Do you mean like get a hair brush and brush the wig hair? Is that what you mean?

623
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Because yeah, definitely something that I would do. I think that would be really nice.

624
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Let's see. I have some scissors here. I want to see if it would make for good sounds. So let me know what you think.

625
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Snip, snip, snip, snip. Don't worry. I'm always snipping away the dead ends, so your hair...

626
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Fuck, I can't talk because that's so stupid. So your hair can grow healthy.

627
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip.

628
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:53,000
You know what else I like to do? Sometimes I like to use scissors for ASMR, but not for hair cutting.

629
01:42:54,000 --> 01:43:14,000
For cutting away negative energy. So if snowberries are feeling a bit down or tired, I'm going to snip it all away, and you're going to feel much better after it.

630
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I know it sounds kind of silly, but I like to think of it that way sometimes.

631
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip.

632
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip.

633
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Lemonade audio for your decent. I mean, yeah, I could, but I guess my thought pattern about it is like, well, I've already made two of them,

634
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,000
so I feel like if I make a third one, then it's boring.

635
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Like, I don't know what would make it better.

636
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:23,000
I don't want to just upload a bunch of lemonade sounds every day because I mean, that's just going to be boring.

637
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I think I'm going to get cat noises, meow somewhere, meow.

638
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Wait, you did too? Yeah, I did too. If you go through my media, you will find the second one or just scroll down.

639
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:06,000
It's not boring, just boost up what you're doing at the time, doing a random stream.

640
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Maybe, maybe I'll do that. Maybe I'll do that.

641
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snipe, snip

642
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Snipe, snipe, snipe, snipe, snip, snip, snipe, snip, snip, snip

643
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:54,640
All right, someone asked if I can do some yawing or yaw sounds.

644
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:47,000
yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, y

645
01:47:47,000 --> 01:48:05,280
yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw,

646
01:48:35,280 --> 01:49:05,280
ха-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-

647
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:35,280
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

648
01:49:35,280 --> 01:50:04,280
Because I feel bad if when I raid, if there's people that are asleep, or are really comfy, will get like jump scared, and I don't want that, and I did raid Stranny last days in my stream, but I don't know how.

649
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:15,280
How you feel? I guess I feel bad for the people that might get jump scared, cause I don't know.

650
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:42,280
I don't know. I'll try to duck louder towards the end of the stream, like last ASMR stream.

651
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:57,280
What is Mano raid? I don't know what that is. Oh no, it's people talking outside.

652
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:11,280
Sorry, people talking outside.

653
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:33,280
I don't know. I would feel like too shy to raid anyone else. That's not my gen mates, so there's bad too.

654
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:44,280
I mostly just keep to myself, and I'm only more comfy around my gen mates.

655
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:54,280
But I will talk a bit louder, or let no one advance towards the end of the stream like I did.

656
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:58,280
Anyways, let me drink some water.

657
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:32,280
I'm too shy for that. I'm really bad with initiating with the people.

658
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:42,280
And even with my gen mates, a lot of times I don't initiate conversations. Just how my brain is, I guess.

659
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:52,280
I say can you try finger flattering? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's do some finger flattering.

660
01:53:33,280 --> 01:54:02,280
What the fuck is that question? What? What is the power of something so what?

661
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:12,280
I'm sorry, but I have literally no idea what that question means. I literally do not understand what.

662
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:25,280
I don't know what this word means either.

663
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:45,280
I'm sorry, I don't know. I have no idea what this is. I've never seen that meme, so I don't know.

664
01:54:46,280 --> 01:55:01,280
The biology meme? Well, I'm just stupid, so you can't give me memes about any science or biology or any of that, because I'm just a baby.

665
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:08,280
I'm just a little baby. I don't know what any of that stuff.

666
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:36,280
The only biology you need to know is what it is that you just see personally.

667
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:42,280
True, that all that really matters, I agree.

668
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:09,280
I'm sorry.

669
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:39,280
I'm sorry.

670
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,280
I'm sorry.

671
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:06,280
I'm sorry.

672
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:12,280
I'm sorry.

673
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:32,280
I'm sorry, because I have a death in my mouth. That's why I'm sorry.

674
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:41,280
I'm sorry.

675
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,280
I'm sorry.

676
01:58:06,280 --> 01:58:08,280
I love you so much.

677
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:12,280
I love you so very much.

678
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:14,280
I love you so very much.

679
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:32,280
I love you so very much.

680
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:46,280
I love you so very much.

681
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:48,280
I love you so very much.

682
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:03,280
I love you so very much.

683
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:15,280
I love you so very much.

684
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:35,280
I love you so very much.

685
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:44,280
I love you so very much.

686
01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:58,280
I love you so very much.

687
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:14,280
I love you so very much.

688
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:24,280
I'm so embarrassed.

689
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:31,280
Someone said I sound like a nerd.

690
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:38,280
I know it's your way.

691
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:46,280
Snow bears would hate me now because it sounds like a nerd.

692
02:00:46,280 --> 02:00:49,280
When I have my passion, you aren't the one.

693
02:00:56,280 --> 02:01:00,280
I want to sound cute, but if I don't sound cute,

694
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:04,280
when I use the pacifier, I won't use it.

695
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:17,280
Snow bears would hate me now because it sounds like a nerd.

696
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:30,280
I love you so very much.

697
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:44,280
I love you so very much.

698
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:52,280
I love you so very much.

699
02:02:12,280 --> 02:02:15,280
I love you so very much.

700
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:44,280
I love you so very much.

701
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:01,280
I love you so very much.

702
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:11,280
I love you so very much.

703
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:17,280
Even if the fart gets taken down,

704
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:20,280
if someone archives this stream,

705
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:26,280
I will tweet the link to the archive.

706
02:03:28,280 --> 02:03:30,280
Just don't worry.

707
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:45,280
I love you so very much.

708
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,280
I love you so very much.

709
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:53,280
I love you so very much.

710
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:14,280
I love you so very much.

711
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:39,280
I love you so very much.

712
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:44,280
I'm very joy with

713
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:48,280
the little magic tub.

714
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:50,280
Oh no.

715
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:52,280
It's so much fun.

716
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:54,280
Shut up.

717
02:04:54,280 --> 02:04:56,280
I'm the only baby here.

718
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:05,280
I'm the only baby.

719
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:07,280
Shut up.

720
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:10,280
I'm the only baby here.

721
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:15,280
I'm the only baby here.

722
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:29,280
I'm the only baby here.

723
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:33,280
No.

724
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:34,280
Ew.

725
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:36,280
No.

726
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:38,280
It's from the outside.

727
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:40,280
I told you.

728
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:42,280
It's from the outside.

729
02:05:42,280 --> 02:05:45,280
Because my mic picks up everything from the outside.

730
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:47,280
Ew.

731
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:48,280
I don't have kids.

732
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:51,280
No.

733
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:54,280
It's from the outside.

734
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:57,280
I'm the only baby here.

735
02:05:58,280 --> 02:06:00,280
I'm the only baby here.

736
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:10,280
No.

737
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:12,280
I'm the only kid.

738
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:14,280
I wouldn't want kids.

739
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:16,280
When I'm the kid.

740
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:22,280
I want all these things to give all the attention to me forever.

741
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:26,280
All attention on me.

742
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:28,280
And me only.

743
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:40,280
Mm-hmm.

744
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:48,280
It's the best thing to do.

745
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:51,280
That's what I am.

746
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:10,280
No.

747
02:07:10,280 --> 02:07:11,280
No.

748
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:12,280

02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:53,820
is

814
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:56,660
機

815
02:09:56,660 --> 02:10:00,660
And the time you're here with me, I enjoy the stream.

816
02:10:02,660 --> 02:10:07,660
But more important, I hope that you enjoyed the stream as well.

817
02:10:07,660 --> 02:10:15,660
I'm sorry if it wasn't as good as the first ASMR stream.

818
02:10:26,660 --> 02:10:48,660
Okay, so I'm gonna talk a little louder so that you can wakey-wakey.

819
02:10:48,660 --> 02:10:51,660
Wakey-wakey is not very...

820
02:10:52,660 --> 02:10:54,660
Wakey-wakey is not very...

821
02:10:56,660 --> 02:10:59,660
I'm gonna miss you, Snow Berries.

822
02:10:59,660 --> 02:11:01,660
I'm gonna miss you, Snow Berries.

823
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:05,660
But it's okay, cause tomorrow...

824
02:11:06,660 --> 02:11:12,660
Cause tomorrow I will be doing another stream, another ASMR stream.

825
02:11:12,660 --> 02:11:15,660
So it's okay, I will do more ASMR tomorrow.

826
02:11:15,660 --> 02:11:20,660
But I am gonna miss you, and I am gonna think of you.

827
02:11:22,660 --> 02:11:23,660
Like, I always do.

828
02:11:24,660 --> 02:11:28,660
But yeah, Snow Berries, try to wake up.

829
02:11:29,660 --> 02:11:31,660
Because I'm gonna be waiting strongy.

830
02:11:34,660 --> 02:11:36,660
I miss you, I see you.

831
02:11:36,660 --> 02:11:38,660
I'm gonna miss you too.

832
02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:41,660
I'm gonna miss all of you.

833
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:46,660
We'll meet again tomorrow again, for more ASMR.

834
02:11:46,660 --> 02:11:48,660
Okay, I promise.

835
02:11:49,660 --> 02:11:52,660
I love you, Snow Berries.

836
02:11:52,660 --> 02:11:55,660
I love you now, be thinking of you.

837
02:11:56,660 --> 02:12:00,660
Okay, you're always on my mind, 24-7.

838
02:12:03,660 --> 02:12:05,660
I love you, Snow Berries.

839
02:12:06,660 --> 02:12:09,660
Okay, thank you again for being here.

840
02:12:09,660 --> 02:12:12,660
I'll see you again tomorrow, okay?

841
02:12:12,660 --> 02:12:14,660
Bye-bye, Sonyeo.

842
02:12:14,660 --> 02:12:16,660
I love you.

843
02:12:18,660 --> 02:12:21,660
Bye-bye, bye-bye.
