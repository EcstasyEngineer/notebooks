0	15680	Fear is an emotion that has faded my mind for as long as I can remember, yet, today,
15680	20280	I am scared.
20280	25040	I cannot remember when or how I came to this land.
25040	31880	Mother tells me she had followed a trail from a mysterious wreckage and found me in a cave.
31880	38680	I was surrounded by death and darkness, yet I was the only one to survive.
38680	44240	This day she told me of was the last time I had ever cried.
44240	50520	She had seen the unfathomable abuse that plagued her family for generations, the monster of
50520	55240	a bear that wriggled fear throughout the food chain of this land.
55240	63840	Its mere presence cursing the very soil under the snow, that, here it was, that at the hands
63840	68400	of a mere child who said crying alone.
68400	75200	It was then she had decided to raise me as her own, along with my brother and sister.
75200	82360	She taught me strength to hunt, to survive.
82360	85360	I had no memories of my birth family.
85360	91960	I did not feel the need to search for them, or I had my family here, and they had me.
91960	97320	I was a bear like them, and they treated me no different.
97320	103600	We all shared the same love, but Mama knew it was not meant to be.
103720	109640	There comes a time in the bear's life where they must go out on their own, and that time
109640	112080	was approaching fast.
112080	119880	Mama knew the cops would be fine, but me, I couldn't even find them being without them.
119880	125560	Until one day, over the mountains, she happened upon an answer.
125560	131320	An answer I didn't want to accept, but one I had to.
131360	139120	And now, this day, the day if fear finally formed in my heart for the first time, saying
139120	146400	their final goodbyes, my brother went one way, my sister went another.
146400	154440	But there I stood, my body and mind, tempered from this land of unforgiving cold, was frozen
154440	157360	still.
157400	164640	Mother offered me her strength one last time, enough to cement the final memory of her tenderness,
164640	168160	my final goodbye.
168160	173600	She would watch over me one last time, when my journey down from the mountaintop into
173600	175800	the unknown of the future.
175800	182400	The memory of her love within me made the fear in my heart melt away, like the ice and
182400	183400	spring.
183400	189000	But she reminded me that the warmth of her love made me into a survivor.
