Mother tells me she had followed a trail from a mysterious wreckage and found me in a cave.
I was surrounded by death and darkness.
Yet I was the only one to survive.
This day she told me of was the last time I had ever cried.
She had seen the unfathomable abuse that plagued her family for generations.
A monster of a bear that wriggled fear throughout the food chain of this land.
Its mere presence pressing the very soil under the snow
that here it was that at the hands of a mere child
was said crying alone.
It was then she had decided to raise me as her own
along with my brother and sister.
She taught me strength to hunt to survive.
I had no memories of my birth family.
I did not feel the need to search for them
or I had my family here and they had me.
I was a bear like them and they treated me no different.
We all shared the same love
but mama knew it was not meant to be.
There comes a time in the bear's life
where they must go out on their own
and that time was approaching fast.
Mama knew the cops would be fine
but me I couldn't even find them being without them
until one day over the mountains
she happened upon an answer.
An answer I didn't want to accept
but one I had to.
And now this day
the day fear finally formed in my heart for the first time
saying their final goodbyes
my brother went one way
my sister went another
but there I stood
my body and mind
tempered from this land of unforgiving cold
was frozen still.
Mother offered me her strength one last time
enough to cement the final memory of her tenderness
my final goodbye
she would watch over me one last time
on my journey down from the mountain top
into the unknown of the future
the memory of her love within me
made the fear in my heart melt away
like the ice and spring
but she reminded me that the warmth of her love
made me into a survivor
The End
Hello everybody
Hi, it's so good to see you. Hello
My name is Icing Snowpaws
the feral polar bear from VLR's Generation 1
in Daulge
It's so good to see everyone
I have to admit, I'm feeling quite, you know, quite nervous
so I think the thing we should probably start with
how about we break the ice?
Come on!
Okay, well, that doesn't really seem to work that well
I got too big of a chunk of ice
so maybe we'll be able to break the ice a bit later
I hope you don't mind
With that being said, I heard from civilization
that it's supposed to be good manners
if you bring some nice food or a treat
to a big social gathering
which I assume what today is, right?
So, I actually made something for you to eat
I brought some fresh ice-cones just for you
and I really, really hope that you will like them
I put so much heart into them
and I was like, mmm, I really hope that they will enjoy them
Oh, awesome, don't worry
It's just lemon, nothing else, so...
Don't worry about it, it's very nice and delicious
Also, with that being said
I really want to go outside and play in the snow
so I can actually tell you a bit more about myself
You know why?
Because with my big pause paper is just kind of too much for me
and hard to deal with
So, I think what we should do
is you should come outside together with me
I know you're really cozy in your room
but I think we should go outside
Come on now!
Open the door
or I'm going to throw rock through your window, you dumb whore
Get back here, you little freak
Get back here, you little freak
Yay, we are now finally outside
I'm sorry I had to drag you out
but you know, you seem to be very resistive
so I thought it would be a good idea
if I just drag you out
With that being said
let's get to know me a little bit better
Let me drop over the snow
because that makes it easier on my pause
I hope you don't mind
So, my name is Isisnopause
My birthday, 27th of February
Did you actually know
that 27th of February
is also National Polar Bear Day?
Well, now you know
Age
I honestly have no idea
Animals do not really have concept of time
we do not keep track of stuff like ages
or what week it is and such
so you're just gonna have to
assume for yourself
My height is 142 cm
2 cm taller than Emi
That means I'm extra cool
My languages
I speak English and Russian
Привет всем
Меня зовут Isisnopause
Я очень рада вас видеть сегодня
Спасибо, что вы пришли увидеть меня
Ok
For the next information
we have some of my likes
and dislikes
I'll move a little bit
so you can see the full thing
Likes
I love popsicles
Very yummy
Refreshing
Cats
They're just so freaking cute
I have two cats over here
His name is Baklash
And her name is Potato
They're my two cats and I love them a lot
I love spinning on chairs
because it reminds me of amusement parks
and if I can't go to an amusement park
I can just go spin on chairs
It's just fun
Biting feels good against my teeth
Plushies, they're just so cute
There can never be enough of them
I just love collecting more and more
The feeling of nostalgia
Just makes me really really happy
That's really all there is to it
I love sparkly and shiny things
Like if I see glitter or something shiny
I just go
Wow, I need that
I need to see what's that about
I also love getting praised
I mean, who doesn't to be honest
Good words always make me smile
I love salmon and tuna
They're my favorite fish to eat
They're just so delicious
Really can't go wrong with them
I love sweet alcohol
Because if you give me something bitter
I'm just not gonna drink it
I like to have a nice flavor in my mouth
Coffee, I only drink it decaf
Because caffeine makes my tummy upset
Probably not good for a polar bear diet
This likes dust
Usually makes my nose
Like
Itchy and sneezy
And yeah, I just don't like it
Extreme heat
I mean, my body just doesn't deal well with it
Considering I'm a polar bear
So that's about that
Math, numbers, anything related to that
Just makes my brain extremely foggy
I love popcorn
But I hate when it gets stuck in my teeth
So I kind of have a love-hate relationship
With popcorn because of that
Because I'm always really scared
That a piece is gonna get stuck
And I'm not gonna be able to take it out
And next we have my tags
My Oshi mark
If you want to Oshi me and you like me
It's polar bear and an ice cube
My life tag is
Ice line
My fan art tag is
IC canvas
For, you know, more
Not safe work art
IC Oshi
For those of you who enjoy the more
Loot stuff
Clips
IC clipped
Memes
IC memes
And fan name, which is your name
Is snowberries
I was trying to find a name
That was supposed to be like
With a cute pond and stuff like that
And you look so cute
You look kind of like a blueberry
But you're also a bear
So I was like, hmm
Let's see what kind of name could I pick
That's like has a pond
And it's also like really cute and stuff
So I was like, wait
Snowberry sounds so cool and like
Just super cute
Also, before I go to the next slide
There will be some slides that you will not see
In this debut
You will have to come to my debut 2.0
In order to see the rest of the slides
As our time is
Fair limited today
So I hope you understand and
Maybe just get even more curious about me next
I also have
Lots of credits
For all the wonderful people
Who made today
Possible
They all worked very hard to make everything
Beautiful
Nice looking and I really appreciate
Everyone's hard work
That they've put into everything
That they've made
And now
Wow
If you are wondering
What this is
This is actually
My little diary thing
And I like to write
Important things in my diary
And of course how could I not
Write in my diary about my friends
My beautiful gen mates
That I love so much
And that make me so happy
So let me
Let me start with
Strony
Strony there's just so much to say
She's so understanding
She's always there for me
She is so hard working
And it's like a quality that
I really wish that
I can become more like her
And learn to be more like her
It's just
It's humanly
Impossible to me
That someone is possible
Someone is able
Sorry
I'm drawing on my words a bit
Sorry
It's crazy
How much she works genuinely
And she's really amazing
So supportive really
But good things to say about her
Then we have
Shibi
Just look at her
She's just so cool
And I feel like if I was walking somewhere
And she was walking with me
I would just feel so much safety around her
Like she looks like
She could beat the shit out of someone
If they were trying to caress me
Or do something
And she's just overall really cool
And she's really
She's all of that
You know
Cold outside
Texture she has
She is very sweet
And I love her
And then we have Marcy
Our Yandere
She's very outgoing
Super sweet
And silly
One of the qualities that I hope to
Learn to be more like her
Is I hope that
I can be more outgoing like her
She is so good at like
Always initiating conversations
But I'm like the kind of person
Who is too scared to initiate conversations
With anyone
So I always talk like in group chat
But
I never initiate because I get really shy
And nervous
And stuff like that
I love Marcy
She's just so cute
And then
Then look who we have here
We have Amy
Amy is so freaking talented
Like
Is there anything that she cannot do
She's just so talented
And adorable and precious
And she gives me that feeling
Of wanting to protect her
Now I know that she can
Protect herself very well
Thanks to her book
But with that being said
If she ever lost that book
Or if something happened to it
You know, I would be there to protect her
With my claws
And make sure that she is okay
Hold on
Let me move a little bit
Make myself a little bit smaller
So we can see
The beautiful Ezra
Hold on
Okay, that's kind of better
I think
Okay
Okay, so we have Ezra
Oh my god, Ezra
Her voice is
Just so calming
Soothing
Even when she speaks normally
She always sounds so
Calming
It's insane, it's like she has
Just default ASMR voice
It's something I've never heard before
She is also very wise
And gentle
Like kind
And warm
And she really gives good
Wise advices as well
Like if I am not sure about something
Or I'm gonna do something
I usually like ask about it
And then she always comes up with
Good advices that just kind of
Make me go like
I should think about that
But yeah, she's just so smart
And yeah, I love
All of my gen mates
So amazing
They're all so sweet
All of them have amazing qualities
And I just feel so incredibly lucky
To be working alongside them
And be here today
I am now
Going to
Go to my room
So I can show you some of my toggles as well
Hi
Let me come in
Okay
I think this is good enough
I think this is fine
I have lots of animations
And different stuff to show you
So let's start with the first one
Whenever you make me angry
I hope you are careful
Because I'm definitely gonna use my claws
On you
And I will not hesitate to use some of you annoying me
But there are times when
You do say something really sweet to me
And
It makes me blush
And sometimes I do have my moments where
Even someone like me can get a bit
Flustered
I'm also having
A lot of tears of joy right now
Because everyone
Is making me so happy
Tears of joy are
Truly truly the best
Wow
Sometimes something suspicious happens
That really makes me think
And go hmm
Something's weird going on
Something's
Kind of suspicious
And
I also have
Heart eyes for all the times
That you make me feel extremely
Loved and happy
So you will get to see me
Show a bit of love every once in a while
Even I have
My soft side as well
What happened?
What's that?
What? I can hear you
Wow
So many people
Wow
You know
Sometimes disappointing things happen as well
And you just go
Oh well
But that is not today
That is definitely not today
I don't know if you remember
But I actually talked about dust
And my room is a bit dusty
And dust makes me sneeze
And my nose itchy
And stuff like that
So sometimes
It makes me sneeze
Kind of like
Kind of like right now
Wait I think
I feel another one coming
Another one coming
Never mind
Never mind
I don't feel it anymore
I don't feel it anymore
I wonder if I'm
Missing anything
Actually yes I am
I just remembered
I don't know if you guys know
But polar bears don't hibernate actually
So I have times
When I get extremely tired
And that results in me
Having dark eye circles
That's
Honestly going to be me today
Because I have to stay up extremely late
So
If you see me during the group collab
And I look like this
You know why because I'm extremely tired
And sleepy
Last but not least
Before we go to the next thing
I have my
Schedule
Yay
Yay schedule
Okay so
Tomorrow
It will be my debut
2.12
And then I'll be playing
Tomb Raider Legend
After that I will be playing
Rockstar live simulator on Tuesday
And then Wednesday
I'll be napping and recharging
And then Thursday
We'll be playing little polar bear
And the great bear
Maybe you get to know some more stuff about me
And my polar bear life
And then Friday
I'll be doing some ASMR stream
And then Saturday
It's gonna be a very fun stream
Saturday is going to be
An archive DJ stream
Where I'll also be drinking
And when I DJ I party hard
I go hard
So I hope you get all the energy that you can
Because we'll be playing lots of amazing music
And we'll be doing lots of good stuff
Okay now that we've been
Talking for a bit
And showing you the schedule

I think we need to do something
Something a little bit more like
Big and exciting and fun
Like you know
Sledges are nice
And all of that
But we should really celebrate
Via Laura's big debut today

So I think
What we should do right now
Is go outside
