451000	480000	um num num num num num num today we are going to be playing the polar bear game it's a it's a pretty old game it took me a while to set it up and stuff but that's how it is with retro games sadly I love them so much but a lot of them are a big pain to
481000	501000	just to set up also why the hell does my model keep pausing what the hell do I need to like do something I wonder if I need to have my iPhone plugged in the whole time or something what the fuck I missed me
502000	525000	that's really sweet I I think it's really sweet to hear that I have been missed you know cuz like it how do I explain it like when someone tells me that they miss me it's like this nice feeling of like oh so so it means that my absence
526000	539000	uh means something you know cuz like when like you're gone and nobody misses you that it makes you feel like well what's the point of streaming right nobody misses me anyway so
539000	559000	uh why stream but but because you do miss me uh it makes me go like oh they they actually do miss me and and they think of me so like that gives me like a big reason to uh to stream you know like if
559000	578000	you weren't here I wouldn't have a reason to stream to be honest and it wouldn't be fun you know so uh yeah that's what we're gonna do today I am gonna try to open the game um and when I open the game you know
578000	588000	same thing we do every gaming stream let me know how the sound of the game is let me know if uh if you can see everything or if there's anything to change and stuff like that

640000	665000	make make my smr stream like not as good as the rest of the girls but I I I hope that it's not gonna but it's not going to bother you too too much and and you know and I don't know that the best that I can provide you with at the moment will be good enough for now anyways
665000	690000	I'll I promise I'll do my very best to make it a good smr stream um another thing I don't know if that is smr stream if the vod is gonna stay up or not because as you've noticed some of my gen mates who did smr they had their vods like bonked by youtube so yeah
691000	713000	if you want to archive tomorrow's smr stream by all means go go ahead and do that because again you you can't know with youtube at the moment what's gonna happen so um yeah if you want to be like extra careful or something like that
714000	731000	um be be sure to archive it and I'll I'll post a link but hopefully hopefully hopefully it doesn't hopefully it doesn't get taken down but if it does well oh well what can you do
732000	754000	oh my god be gentle it's okay oh I well don't worry when um when I do smr I get extremely uh extremely gentle to be honest and whisper and oh lovey dovey and cutesy and yeah

1575000	1579000	I don't know, I feel like I'm making everything worse.
1579000	1582000	I'm so bad at this game.
1582000	1585000	I'm supposed to be for children.
1585000	1587000	Why am I so stupid?
1590000	1594000	Please Igor, you're making it difficult.

1636000	1638000	Hi.
1641000	1644000	Doing the bear doesn't do anything.
1644000	1648000	Clicking the bear doesn't do anything.
1648000	1651000	Fuck.
1651000	1654000	Why did you do the puzzle game though?
1654000	1657000	Because I thought I'm smart.
1659000	1662000	Because it's a children's game.
1662000	1665000	But I'm fucking stupid.
1670000	1673000	Pull it from the other side.
1673000	1675000	Okay, but what's the other side?
1675000	1679000	There's two sides left, right, up and down.
1679000	1682000	I don't know what other side means.
1682000	1689000	You have to tell me specifically what side and what number of the row.
1689000	1691000	You are too smart for the game.
1691000	1693000	No, I'm not.
1693000	1695000	I'm stupid.
1697000	1700000	I have to save Igor.
1702000	1705000	I have to save Igor, but I'm too smart.
1705000	1707000	Good Lord, keep it up.
1707000	1709000	I'm too stupid.
1709000	1711000	Pull from the front.
1711000	1713000	Okay, that's not smart.
1713000	1715000	Come on.
1717000	1719000	Come on.
1722000	1724000	Come on.
1727000	1730000	Left four.
1730000	1734000	That's as much as far as it goes.
1734000	1736000	Pull four.
1736000	1739000	Try the fourth arrow on the left.
1739000	1742000	Well, that's how it does.
1742000	1745000	I have to save Igor.
1745000	1747000	I'm really stupid.
1747000	1750000	I feel better already.
1751000	1755000	Igor, shut up, please.
1755000	1758000	Oh my fucking God.
1758000	1760000	I'm so embarrassed, honestly.
1760000	1762000	I was like, I can do this.
1762000	1765000	This is a children's game.
1765000	1769000	But I'm too fucking stupid, apparently, for that.
1769000	1772000	Oh, great.
1772000	1775000	I feel better already.
1775000	1778000	I'm gonna die, please.
1779000	1787000	I feel so bad.
1787000	1790000	It's over for me.
1790000	1793000	It's so over for me.
1797000	1800000	I feel better already.
1800000	1803000	Stop moaning.
1803000	1807000	Stop moaning, Igor, please.
1807000	1810000	I feel better already.
1810000	1813000	Please, stop being...
1813000	1818000	Please, I'm trying to think and you're not helping me.
1818000	1822000	Come on, not like this.
1822000	1826000	Why can't I not move this one?
1826000	1828000	Come on.
1828000	1831000	This is the first fucking thing.
1838000	1843000	I feel better already.
1843000	1848000	Guys, I need...
1848000	1851000	Whatever.
1856000	1859000	Oh my God.
1861000	1864000	Hello?
1864000	1868000	Hello? Why can't I click anything?
1868000	1871000	What is this?
1871000	1873000	Whenever you want to come back and play with me,
1873000	1877000	all you have to do is to become a friend that you chose at the beginning.
1877000	1879000	See you soon.
1879000	1883000	No, not like this.
1886000	1888000	No!
1888000	1891000	What the fuck?
1891000	1895000	Oh my fucking God.
1895000	1898000	Please.
1898000	1901000	Okay, I'm sorry.
1901000	1906000	But I'm not dealing with Shibi's ropes, okay?
1906000	1911000	I'm too stupid to untie Shibi's ropes, okay?
1911000	1914000	Igor is going to be okay.
1914000	1917000	Shibi's gonna come back, she's gonna untie Igor
1917000	1920000	and he's gonna be fine.
1920000	1923000	I think I'm smart enough to deal with Shibi's ropes.
1923000	1926000	I'm sorry, she's gonna have to deal with that herself.
1926000	1928000	Are you sure of your choice?
1928000	1931000	We're gonna go somewhere.
1931000	1934000	It will allow you to come back to your game where you left off.
1934000	1936000	Okay, okay.
1936000	1938000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1938000	1940000	Damn, I should have just went with the story mode
1940000	1942000	and pretend that I'm doing it.
1942000	1946000	You can play with Lars and help him along on his adventure in the game.
1946000	1949000	Or you can follow his adventure like a story mode.
1949000	1951000	Lars, please.
1951000	1953000	Please, let me do something.
1953000	1955000	Please, I'm too stupid for this.
1958000	1960000	No, no.
1960000	1962000	Wait, what?
1962000	1964000	Wait, what? No!
1964000	1967000	No, there's a minute for me to have to do this again!
1967000	1971000	Before we go and see Igor, we'll have to catch some food.
1971000	1973000	Help me catch the fish.
1973000	1975000	When a fish jumps out of the water,
1975000	1978000	please tell me I don't have to do this shit again.
1979000	1981000	No, please.
1981000	1983000	Please, no.
1983000	1985000	Please, no.
1986000	1989000	Please, let me go somewhere else.
1989000	1991000	Please, I'm begging.
1992000	1994000	And please.
1995000	1998000	Please, I'm begging.
1998000	2000000	Please.
2000000	2003000	Please, let me have fun.
2004000	2007000	Oh my fucking god.
2007000	2009000	Whenever you want to come back and play with me,
2009000	2013000	all you have to do is click on the friend that you chose at the beginning.
2013000	2015000	See you soon.
2018000	2022000	This is the worst fucking stream ever.
2022000	2024000	What the fuck am I doing?
2024000	2026000	Please.
2026000	2028000	Why am I stupid?
2028000	2030000	Oh my god.
2030000	2032000	I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm stupid, okay?
2032000	2034000	I'm sorry I have no brain cells left.
2034000	2036000	Hello?
2036000	2039000	I know who you are, shut up.
2039000	2041000	Choose one of my friends.
2041000	2044000	He will be your playmate and remember our adventure.
2044000	2046000	Oh my god, okay.
2046000	2048000	Be sure of your choice.
2048000	2050000	Don't forget which animal you chose.
2050000	2054000	It will allow you to come back to your game where you left off.
2054000	2056000	Please.
2056000	2060000	I'm low-key tempted to do fucking stories.
2060000	2063000	Because I'm too fucking stupid.
2063000	2066000	And help him along on his adventure in the game.
2066000	2069000	Or you can follow his adventure like a storybook.
2071000	2075000	Okay, I need your opinion.
2075000	2079000	What do you Snowberries think I should do?
2079000	2083000	You can play with Lars and help him along on his adventure in the game.
2083000	2086000	Should I keep trying to get rid of those fucking ropes?
2086000	2091000	Or should I just give up and do fucking story mode?
2093000	2095000	Oh my god.
2095000	2097000	The animals are just save slots.
2097000	2099000	Okay, that makes sense.
2099000	2101000	I'm fucking stupid.
2101000	2104000	Just try again, you can do it.
2104000	2106000	Okay, I have one more chance to do the rope.
2106000	2108000	Story mode. You have to get good.
2108000	2109000	I'll never get good.
2109000	2112000	You can play with Lars and help him along on his adventure in the game.
2112000	2114000	I'll give him my room and go.
2114000	2116000	Okay.
2116000	2121000	If you need any help during the game, just click on Lars and he'll give you some help.
2121000	2123000	No, he won't.
2123000	2125000	Why is he lying?
2125000	2126000	Why is he lying?
2126000	2133000	He's like, oh, if you need some help, click Lars and he will help you.
2133000	2135000	No, he didn't.
2135000	2137000	He didn't fucking help me.
2137000	2142000	I was clicking him like not fucking stop.
2142000	2146000	I was clicking Lars not stop for help.
2146000	2149000	And he didn't give me any help.
2149000	2151000	What the fuck?
2155000	2156000	The narrowed.
2156000	2157000	Oh fuck.
2157000	2159000	Okay, at least I can fish.
2159000	2163000	At least I have that going for me in this life.
2163000	2168000	Lars is like fucking stupid.
2168000	2171000	He's the oldest one in the north.
2171000	2173000	He has an amazing memory.
2173000	2175000	Lars, you're good.
2178000	2183000	Oh god, I'm gonna have to listen to Igor Mon again, please.
2183000	2186000	Hi, Igor. What happened to you?
2186000	2189000	Lars, I'm stuck in this fishing net.
2189000	2194000	Please help me get out by pulling on the ropes to put them in the right order.
2194000	2199000	We'll have to use all our strength to pull these ropes.
2199000	2202000	Oh god, here we go.
2202000	2204000	Keep Lars, keep it up.
2204000	2207000	Oh god.
2209000	2214000	Oh god, oh this is gonna be so fucking bad.
2214000	2217000	Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.
2217000	2226000	Please.
2226000	2232000	Oh, I feel better already.
2232000	2237000	I don't, I feel like shit.
2237000	2244000	You know, when I planned going back to the wild for a visit with OG suns,
2244000	2251000	this is not what I had in mind.
2251000	2253000	Please stop moaning.
2253000	2258000	You're making it very difficult for me to rescue you, okay Igor?
2258000	2265000	I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to shut up.
2265000	2267000	I see which rope affects...
2267000	2271000	I can't even fucking talk because he starts moaning.
2271000	2276000	Which rope affects the fourth one?
2276000	2280000	This one? This one on this?
2280000	2286000	Please.
2286000	2291000	No.
2299000	2303000	I love how I click Lars.
2303000	2307000	And he's just not fucking helping in any fucking way.
2307000	2309000	Igor is a freak.
2309000	2318000	The second one on the top, bottom, and the second one.
2318000	2320000	Good Lars, keep it up.
2320000	2323000	Please, Igor, I, I...
2323000	2326000	How did you get yourself in this mess?
2326000	2332000	Like, what are you doing?
2332000	2337000	Please, help.
2337000	2340000	Man.
2340000	2344000	You sure this is a children's game, you know?
2344000	2357000	I thought so, but I guess I'm too fucking stupid for a children's game.
2357000	2363000	This stupid rope.
2363000	2367000	Why can't I just bring my fucking scissors?
2367000	2372000	Maybe you're too smart, I think like a child.
2372000	2375000	I feel better already.
2375000	2380000	Please, Igor, stop.
2380000	2383000	Good Lars, keep it up.
2383000	2389000	Please.
2389000	2394000	Marisa, you got the ropes for me.
2394000	2397000	Shut up, Igor, please.
2397000	2400000	Oh my fucking God, please.
2400000	2403000	Good Lars, keep it up.
2403000	2409000	Good Lars, keep it up.
2409000	2411000	Okay.
2411000	2414000	Okay.
2414000	2417000	Oh.
2417000	2427000	Please, please don't do anything like that.
2427000	2432000	Mmm.
2432000	2435000	Now what?
2435000	2439000	This stupid fucking rope, fucking die.
2439000	2441000	Please.
2441000	2446000	Good Lars, keep it up.
2446000	2449000	Come on, please.
2449000	2451000	Please, this should be good enough.
2451000	2454000	Please, you literally don't have any ropes around you anymore.
2454000	2456000	Please, you can literally escape this.
2456000	2458000	What do you mean?
2458000	2461000	You're not even attached to him anymore.
2461000	2465000	Please, Igor, please.
2465000	2470000	Oh, you can escape.
2470000	2476000	I'm begging.
2476000	2482000	Oh my fucking...
2482000	2486000	Oh my God, why is life so difficult?
2486000	2490000	God damn it!
2490000	2495000	Ah!
2495000	2497000	I feel better already.
2497000	2504000	Well, if you feel better, just freaking get out.
2504000	2507000	Oh my God.
2507000	2509000	Why?
2509000	2511000	Why, why?
2511000	2513000	Why, why, why?
2513000	2514000	Why?
2514000	2516000	Why should we make this difficult?
2516000	2519000	Why she has to make ropes all over this way?
2519000	2526000	Why do we need to get all rope of his PNG?
2526000	2535000	I guess so, cause like, he can't escape.
2535000	2537000	Come on.
2537000	2541000	I can't believe he's not helping me.
2541000	2543000	Very nice.
2543000	2546000	Why does she need to be above now?
2546000	2548000	I don't know, do they?
2548000	2553000	Why don't they start moving like the one on the left, though?
2553000	2555000	You see, like this?
2555000	2558000	Starts moving it like this.
2558000	2561000	I feel better already.
2561000	2565000	I can't with the mones.
2565000	2568000	See, it's like, it's making it worse.
2568000	2571000	It's making it worse.
2571000	2576000	So much worse.
2577000	2582000	I have an idea.
2582000	2586000	Let's see.
2586000	2588000	Wow.
2588000	2593000	Fuck off.
2593000	2602000	I'll be honest, a part of me is very tempted right now to go to a fucking YouTube video
2602000	2606000	and just see how they fucking solve this shit.
2606000	2614000	Cause I'm fucking stupid.
2614000	2619000	We're just making an update and making the ropes go away.
2619000	2624000	Don't I need to get the ropes away from him?
2624000	2626000	Why do people put the ropes away?
2626000	2628000	Cause he's a freak.
2628000	2630000	Igor is a freak.
2630000	2632000	You can touch the bear for help, though?
2632000	2634000	No, it doesn't do anything.
2634000	2641000	Keep clicking on him and it doesn't do anything.
2641000	2645000	They said make the right pattern at the start.
2645000	2647000	What is the right pattern, though?
2647000	2650000	What does that even mean?
2650000	2655000	What does the right pattern mean?
2655000	2659000	Fuck this one, honestly, fuck this whale.
2659000	2662000	The net.
2662000	2665000	But we're trying to get him out, though.
2665000	2669000	So, like, what the fuck?
2669000	2672000	Good logs, keep it up.
2672000	2677000	Like, doesn't make sense.
2677000	2680000	How is we trying to get him out?
2680000	2691000	Why the fuck are we trying to...?
2691000	2698000	Good logs, keep it up.
2698000	2701000	This is a game called Google it.
2701000	2707000	The name of the game is in the title.
2707000	2710000	I just looked up video and you're doing this wrong.
2710000	2713000	Just try. You have nothing to lose in this one.
2713000	2716000	That's not true. I'm losing.
2716000	2728000	I am losing everything right now.
2728000	2732000	I am losing my dignity by playing this fucking game.
2732000	2736000	Showing everyone how fucking stupid I am.
2736000	2741000	So, yeah, that's just great.
2741000	2746000	Like this?
2746000	2749000	Okay.
2749000	2755000	Isn't this the right pattern? Like, what does it mean?
2755000	2759000	This looks like the right pattern to me.
2759000	2762000	Right?
2762000	2765000	Time making the square-net pattern.
2765000	2768000	I know. What the fuck?
2768000	2772000	You have to make a tic-tac-toe pattern with the ropes.
2772000	2775000	You need to use all ropes?
2775000	2777000	Okay.
2777000	2780000	Oh my god, shut up. Please, please.
2780000	2785000	You're making this? You're making this so fucking difficult, Lars.
2785000	2788000	Please, I'm begging.
2788000	2795000	Oh my god.
2795000	2800000	Please.
2800000	2803000	How do I feel better?
2803000	2805000	Literally how?
2805000	2807000	What are you doing?
2807000	2810000	Okay.
2810000	2815000	Lars, keep it up.
2815000	2817000	What is this?
2817000	2820000	Hello.
2820000	2822000	Bro, I think...
2822000	2826000	What the fuck?
2826000	2831000	Oh my god. Why are you like this?
2831000	2833000	Bro.
2833000	2839000	I'm literally like, dying right now. What the fuck is going on?
2839000	2844000	You know, I thought this is going to be as simple.
2844000	2846000	Can you see the puzzle?
2846000	2852000	But I was really fucking wrong, apparently.
2852000	2855000	Bro, where is...
2855000	2858000	Where are the other ropes?
2858000	2862000	Like, hello?
2867000	2869000	Oh my...
2869000	2872000	It's so hard to believe.
2873000	2877000	Oh my god.
2877000	2880000	You might actually have to restart.
2880000	2883000	Fuck, not again.
2883000	2887000	Oh, I feel better already.
2887000	2889000	Please.
2889000	2893000	Oh my god.
2893000	2895000	They're off the screen.
2895000	2896000	Okay, we're...
2896000	2899000	Whenever you want to come back and play with me.
2899000	2901000	Literally the worst remember.
2901000	2905000	What the fuck is this shit?
2905000	2909000	Fuck my life.
2909000	2913000	What the fuck is this?
2913000	2916000	Okay, I see no.
2916000	2919000	I'm fucking dying.
2919000	2922000	I'm literally dying right now from embarrassment.
2922000	2924000	From how stupid I am.
2924000	2928000	From how difficult this fucking game is.
2928000	2932000	What the fuck?
2932000	2935000	What the fuck?
2935000	2936000	Do you need a hug?
2936000	2938000	I need you.
2938000	2939000	I don't need a hug.
2939000	2943000	I need you to finish this fucking game for me.
2943000	2946000	That's what I need.
2946000	2948000	I'm so sorry, Oji-san.
2948000	2953000	I'm not the smartest tool in the shit.
2954000	2959000	Oh my god.
2959000	2960000	I'm sorry.
2960000	2964000	I'm really sorry Snow Bear is for this shitty stream.
2964000	2965000	I apologize.
2965000	2969000	I did not think this puzzle was going to be hard.
2969000	2973000	But I was fucking wrong apparently.
2973000	2976000	Before we go and see Ego, we'll have to catch some food.
2976000	2979000	I'm going to have PTSD from this game.
2979000	2981000	When a fish jumps out of the water,
2981000	2983000	catch it as fast as you can.
2983000	2986000	Use your mouth to move my paw
2986000	2989000	and click on the fish as they jump out of the water.
2989000	2992000	I can fish just fine.
2992000	2995000	That's not the problem here, okay?
2995000	2997000	I know what to do.
2997000	2999000	I can fish just fine.
2999000	3000000	Easy.
3000000	3001000	Easy.
3001000	3002000	Easy.
3002000	3003000	Great.
3003000	3005000	We have enough supplies.
3005000	3007000	Let's go and see Ego.
3007000	3008000	We're in mode mode?
3008000	3010000	No, it's not.
3010000	3015000	I'm playing and I'm playing.
3015000	3017000	Oh god.
3017000	3020000	Okay.

4313880	4318880	So, you're welcome for the sacrifice of my own emotions.
4318880	4320880	You're welcome.
4327880	4329880	I mean, okay, let's be fair.
4329880	4331880	Let's be fair.
4331880	4335880	It's to be expected that I'm this dumb, you know?
4335880	4339880	I am literally a feral polar bear, okay?
4339880	4342880	I haven't been in civilization long enough.
4342880	4345880	Just so fucking puzzle today.
4345880	4348880	I hope you'll see each other again soon.
4348880	4350880	I hope so too, Lars. Take care.
4350880	4353880	Would you rather cross the Arctic Ocean on Igor's back
4353880	4355880	or slide down the mountain?
4355880	4358880	Ooh.
4358880	4360880	What should we do?
4360880	4362880	What should we choose?
4362880	4364880	They both sound fun.
4368880	4370880	They both sound fun.
4370880	4373880	Yeah, what should we do?
4373880	4377880	Slide down the mountain?
4377880	4379880	Slide down the mountain?
4379880	4381880	Or ride on Igor's back?
4381880	4383880	Slide, slide.

5104960	5113200	okay let's look at the stars I'll tell you the legend of the great bear just as my father told me
5114000	5116240	okay but why do they call it that
5120400	5124880	as I promised I'm going to tell you another legend about the great bear
5125840	5132800	once upon a time longer ago than any walrus can remember humans lived in peace with all the
5132800	5139760	animals in the world the wisest among them was a man who was married to a very beautiful woman
5140720	5146160	alas she died a short time after they were married leaving him in despair
5147840	5155200	his grief drove him crazy and he took his most beautiful bow and shot many arrows into the sky
5155920	5163680	but he shot his bow so hard that each arrow tore a hole in the sky giving birth to a star
5165360	5171200	light came streaming out of those stars toward the earth and fell on the archer who had created them
5172160	5178480	everyone in the village watched in wonder and when the light had dispersed they saw that the
5178560	5185440	archer had become a bear as white as you lars the hunters were terrified and wanted to kill the
5185440	5192400	bear man who had to flee for his life he walked and walked for a very long time before he arrived
5192400	5199440	in our land of ice and snow in this white land of ours he discovered a simpler life than that of
5199440	5206160	people and he at last found the peace that had disappeared when his wife died the constellation
5206160	5214160	was named after that lovesick archer the four stars that formed the square were born with his arrows
5214160	5223280	i'm just a cob represent the hunters who chased away oh boy i have no idea i'm certainly glad i came

5952100	5961140	and a quiet and stuff because right now like you can hear what the 3do like picks up um what my
5961140	5969620	neighbors do anything like like upstairs or when like carves drive outside like from the window
5969620	5974500	or like if anyone talks like outside like out the window then you can hear it too so
5975220	5984660	i guess i'm pretty nervous about that uh you'll do great now that yourself will be fine so
5985140	5991220	hard any of this oh well that's because i'm not using the 3do right now this mic uh doesn't pick up
5991220	5999940	anywhere as much as uh anywhere as much as the 3do gonna love your voice doing ASMR i hope so i hope
5999940	6006420	you will enjoy it uh i'm sure it would be fantastic no matter what i see and the background noise
6006420	6011140	doesn't bother us imi had background noise and it was still great uh i feel like her background
6011140	6019940	noise was like very minimal so that's why i'm worried um blah blah blah blah uh i forgot what
6019940	6027860	do you think about singing stream uh do you mean like a karaoke stream i am uh by no means a good
6027860	6035460	singer uh i can't sing or anything but i do plan on doing some karaoke streams but like you know
6035460	6041620	just for fun like when i do karaoke streams i'm like fucking around basically so so if you
6041620	6049780	ever come to my karaoke streams please don't expect me to like sing well or anything like that it's
6049780	6060580	just for the big funny blah blah blah blah yes karaoke would be great yeah i would have to be
6060580	6069780	drunk karaoke it would have to be drunk karaoke because like uh because uh blah blah blah i would
6069780	6077540	be nervous singing otherwise let me let me change to my my just my just chatting things i can be like
6077940	6092980	okay okay now now now that's that's a bit better i think
6095780	6101460	that's a bit better now now i'm like now you can see me now you can see me a lot better while we
6101540	6110660	yap together uh did she be scared taking down too yeah her her got taken i think i think mercy
6110660	6116820	is the only one so far that didn't have her but take it down isolation from is pretty good
6116820	6123380	seven proofing windows yeah i i hope that will work uh let me let me put on oh the bgm is on okay
6123380	6131140	never mind it's it's on uh let's see what else sorry i'm trying to like scroll through through
6131140	6144260	the chat and stuff like that um look chat i'll have my pen lights i read it as penis lights not
6144260	6152980	gonna lie like i've read what you said i'll have my pen lights out for ic and i read it as something
6152980	6162500	else chance of russian songs in karaoke um maybe maybe maybe i could find like a song or
6162500	6169220	tour or something like that drunk karaoke sounds even more fun yeah it will be fun i i get like
6169220	6177300	even more ridiculous when i drink so it will be even more fun let's hear a drink of choice for
6177300	6186740	drunk karaoke DJ streams i usually um just try to find uh the sweetest wine that i can find and
6186740	6194580	then drink like pretty much almost the whole bottle what matters to me is that the wine is sweet
6195780	6203060	if it's sweet then i'm happy if it's like dry and bitter then i don't i don't like it
6207380	6210660	yeah let's see
6212420	6213460	chat chat chat
6217780	6223940	mrs was very careful with her stream yeah i i i don't know what's gonna happen in my stream
6223940	6231860	i'll be honest whatever feels natural i'm just gonna go with whatever feels right because i need
6231860	6240420	to buy some ASMR triggers i i don't have uh i don't have too much right now
6244500	6248420	rap i might try but i'm probably gonna suck at it
6248660	6250980	um
6253460	6256420	i see can you do a stream where you teach us russian
6261460	6265220	i i could try but i feel like i would be a really terrible teacher
6265780	6272980	like i don't know what it is but i don't feel i feel like i'm not good at teaching i don't know
6272980	6279460	but maybe maybe if it was something that you were interested in um
6280420	6287860	will you perhaps do a russian ASMR stream in the future i see uh i already got asked this question
6288420	6299780	on one of my moros actually uh so during my ASMR streams uh if enough people want me to uh i can
6299780	6307300	definitely uh you know do some russian like here and there i don't want it to be like the main
6307300	6313380	focus or anything like i want to keep it in english and stuff but i could like maybe like do some
6313380	6323940	russian words here and there or like um russian sentences sentences uh here and there uh i feel
6323940	6331860	like that would be okay do you drink vodka if i drink vodka i like it to be flavored like there
6331860	6338580	is a lot of vodkas that are like flavored and they're like sweet but then again yeah if it's
6338580	6346740	sweet and flavor then yeah uh are you a lightweight yeah i am i'm i'm very lightweight to be honest
6347380	6348660	especially with wine
6349220	6349860	um
6356740	6362180	if you're creative almost anything can be used for ASMR yeah exactly you can make sounds
6362180	6367060	with like anything really but i want to make sure that the sounds are good but then again like
6367780	6372660	ASMR triggers is like there's there's always people who are going to like some triggers
6373380	6379700	and people who don't like some triggers so if you see me doing like a trigger then you're not a
6379700	6386020	big fan of you can always just like mute and unmute when i am done so there's that
6391140	6400100	uh you could just roast us when we don't get it uh i know i could but i don't know i i think
6400100	6409300	i'm gonna keep it like nice and and cute for the ASMR streams are you better at russian than
6409300	6419060	english i'm actually no actually no i am better at english than in russian because i rarely speak
6419060	6426580	russian at this point like i only speak russian uh with my parents you know so because i rarely use
6426580	6434580	russian uh you know when like you don't use a language much uh with time you you know forget
6434580	6440180	some words and stuff like that so sometimes when i talk to my parents i need to like google
6440180	6447620	certain words and like i'm trying to like explain stuff and i'm like what's the word for that what's
6447620	6459300	the word for this and that and i'm just uh yeah so my russian is not as good as it used to be
6459300	6466660	because i just speak english 99 of the time you know and i only use russian with my parents so
6478580	6479460	let me see
6481620	6491620	hey i was wondering if ASMR vods are locked behind patreon uh no we're we're not we're not supposed
6491620	6499620	to have vods in our patreon because apparently youtube is making a fuss about it and it's not
6499620	6509460	allowed or something like that um so you know again if if you want to make sure that you have a
6509460	6518180	vod then you will have to archive it or hope that anyone else archives it and like shares a link for
6518180	6526420	it um i think she should do an ASMR where she drinks ice water that would actually make like a pretty
6526420	6533060	good sound like if i if i got like some ice and i put it like in the water and then i moved it around
6533060	6540500	that actually makes for a really nice trigger so yeah the only two triggers i don't like are eating
6540500	6548340	and marker sound what is what is marker sounds like when you use a marker and like draw with it or
6548340	6551060	what do you mean um
6555860	6561860	are you born and raised in russia no i was actually born i was born in ukraine
6562740	6571860	and my parents uh taught me russian instead of ukrainian because they were like russian is used
6571860	6580900	a lot more than ukrainian so they decided to just teach me russian instead uh but yeah i'm
6580900	6587300	i'm ukrainian like i was i was born in ukraine but uh i speak russian because that's what my parents
6587300	6592820	taught me when i was a child um let me see
6598820	6605380	oh this uh sorry i'm i'm still i'm still trying to like to like uh try and read everything
6606340	6614660	and it's hard so i'm sorry if i if i miss some stuff uh i'm not used to having uh chat uh have
6614740	6622020	so much to say and stuff so uh please please uh please excuse me
6624900	6627140	um fuck
6629060	6635620	bone eating sounds when you like sounds that sound like breaking bones do sound pretty good
6635620	6648100	oh wow interesting i see lord yeah i guess i was speaking of like that i i want to do a zatsu
6648100	6653620	stream eventually i want to do a zatsu stream eventually where i talk about all of my good

6723540	6732820	how is ukraine i have very good memories from it to be honest like a lot of the good memories
6732820	6744020	that i'll be sharing in my zatsu are from like uh from uh more like uh a countryside of ukraine
6744740	6752420	uh because basically we lived in an apartment but we also had like a summer house farm thingy
6752420	6762020	that my grandpa has built and so we would spend a lot of time uh in that house so basically my
6762020	6770580	grandparents like grew vegetables and fruits over there and it was just really really nice over there
6770660	6781780	but yeah i have like so many good memories i actually like i wanna
6783540	6789860	sorry i i want to write down all of the memories so that i remember
6790180	6801380	sorry so i remember uh to to i can't talk i'm getting nervous i don't know why
6801380	6809860	so i can talk about all those good memories and not forget about basically uh because i
6810020	6818020	make for really nice and good good memories you know uh also
6820420	6830820	also i i noticed that uh i got a donation yesterday when i wasn't screaming so i do want to thank

6880340	6887060	happen i see being cute no matter what she does uh i'm i'm glad i'm glad that you think that because
6887060	6893380	there's a lot of moments where i'm like uh i don't know if i'm cute and i don't know if i'm
6894420	6901860	if i'm like i don't know sometimes sometimes i get worried and insecure and worried that i'm not
6901860	6912900	cute enough and stuff um i'm happy that you want to share so much with us yeah of course i think
6912980	6919540	i think it's such a nice thing to i don't know like share these like stuff you know
6920420	6929220	it just like brings brings me joy to be able to talk about it uh to to people who want to listen
6929220	6934980	to it you know because like i could talk to anyone about this stuff but it's not the same
6935620	6941300	if they don't really want to listen so so like hearing that you do want me to do a zatsu stream
6941300	6947380	just tapping about my good memories and share photographs from childhood makes me happy because
6947380	6954500	it's like oh thanks they actually carry on and they want to hear it you know so that's that's
6954500	6967060	really nice uh you're always cute i see don't mean secure you're an adorable princess thank you i'm
6967060	6973940	trying i'm trying uh every every stream i i will get more and more confident and then
6973940	6979460	a year from now hopefully uh i will gain much more confidence
6982580	6988980	i can listen to icf about everything play games i'm glad that makes me happy to hear that
6989540	6996820	um i see epic big content yeah i'm glad you think so i'm glad you don't find it like
6996820	7001700	annoying i guess sometimes i'm also worried that like i talk too much and i'm like
7002820	7008740	and i'm just like man who cares like wow you know
7013380	7016900	man i i need to figure out like why am i trying to pause this sometimes
7017540	7022980	i don't understand why it does that like my cpu is completely fine like there's nothing wrong with
7022980	7026180	it and phone is charged do a thing
7030900	7038500	i gotta see a teeny baby kaba i see yeah you're well that's why i'm super cute i really like
7038500	7044660	how chill your streams are the other girls are cool too but sometimes it's sensory overload for me
7044660	7051220	i'm i'm surprised you're saying that like i feel like mine is very sensory overload if anything
7051220	7057860	because because you know especially today like i was just like screaming a lot today and getting
7057860	7066180	jump scared and and like getting loud and i feel i feel if there's someone who is sensory
7066180	7072580	overload that's me honestly to be honest
7082500	7087780	i love your accent though i always like when you talk thank you i'm i'm glad to hear that
7088660	7090900	how much you hear that um
7094100	7100820	annoying and i should never be used in a sentence oh that's sweet
7102100	7109300	maybe the connection between your phone and computer causing freezes could that be it i wonder
7109300	7116820	i wonder if that could be that i'm not sure maybe i'll hopefully hopefully i can figure that out
7118260	7121460	blah blah blah blah blah blah
7124500	7131140	it's such a nice contrast to your normal talking voice wait what do you mean when i'm like
7132180	7137620	like do you mean like my yapping voice or something like that or are you talking about like
7137620	7144500	when i do like ASMR or something sorry i'm i'm a bit confused i guess a little bit confused

7412980	7418740	sniffing that would kill me but a little bit here and there oh maybe i could do some sniffing
7419460	7425460	tomorrow maybe i could do some a little bit of sniffing in tomorrow's ASMR like here and there
7426420	7431940	you go ptsd okay literally though i feel so much better
7434900	7436660	it's gonna be too funny

7446420	7454660	polar bear yeah i hope so too because um there's uh actually a few point and click games that i
7454660	7466420	would like to uh to play and stand eventually so i think that would be very very nice i can't

7479620	7488500	in my settings uh yes please that would be so cute sniffing and some power-ups yeah that would
7488500	7495860	be really cute and oh and i could like uh i could also like give you a hug as well i i i know i don't

7616340	7620340	i don't know i mean it's not really ASMR like i don't think
7622820	7625780	i don't think that would really work for it so i like i don't think
7627060	7636100	it would really make like a sound or anything like that but anyways uh i'm gonna end the stream
7636100	7644740	here for now and um i'm gonna redirect you to strongy stream uh i will see you again tomorrow
