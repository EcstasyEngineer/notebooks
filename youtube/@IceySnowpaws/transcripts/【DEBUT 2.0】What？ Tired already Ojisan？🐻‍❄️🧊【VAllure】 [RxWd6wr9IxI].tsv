266000	295000	Hello everyone! How are you guys doing? Hello! Hello to all the Snow Berries! Welcome! Welcome! Hi!
296000	316000	Okay, can I just be honest, like, even though it's past debut, I'm still feeling pretty nervous right now, so I'm sorry in advance if I'm still going to be a bit awkward and stuff.
317000	332000	It will take me a few streams to kind of get the hold of stuff and, you know, get completely fully comfy, so I hope that's understandable with you guys.
332000	358000	But thank you so much for showing to my 2.0 debut stream. For those who don't know what a 2.0 stream basically, most debuts these days usually don't have enough time for you to really introduce yourself fully.
358000	379000	Actually, we have limited time and yeah, I only had 30 minutes and well, everyone did. Sorry, I don't know why but I'm so nervous. I'm so nervous. I don't know, I'm so nervous.
380000	396000	I feel like I'm even more nervous than during the debut, honestly. I don't know why. I think it's because now that the debut is over, I'm like, I can actually read the chat and see what you guys are saying.
397000	411000	So it's like trying to read everything and trying to like settle in and stuff, so I'm sorry if I'm even more awkward than I was yesterday.
412000	420000	Maybe you should chill out. You know, maybe I should. Maybe I should try doing that.
420000	435000	I'll ban anyone trying to be mean. Oh, Amy, you're so sweet. Thank you. Yeah, be careful. Amy is here. She has lots of tricks up her sleeve because of her magic book, so make sure you behave.
436000	441000	Alright, there's...
441000	456000	There's just so many things to talk about that I don't even know where to even begin. Like, I'll be honest. I feel like I...
457000	463000	Okay, so there were two slides yesterday that I didn't show during my debut because I didn't have time for them.
463000	479000	And one of them was actually my interest on hobbies. To be honest, I have more interests than what's shown on the slide, but I can't think of them right now because I'm feeling pretty brain dead.
480000	492000	I took a nap before the stream. I was just so sleepy. I woke up kind of early, but it wasn't enough. I went to sleep around...
493000	508000	I think I went to sleep around 1 or 2 a.m. yesterday, so I was really, really tired. Very, very sleepy. I was so out of it.
509000	519000	That's why I was also wheezing non-stop at the group collab because my brain just dies when I get extremely sleepy.
519000	533000	And I just start being extra dumb and silly, and it just results in me sometimes just laughing for no reason.
534000	543000	Do you have a brain freeze? I do, actually. So if I go non-verbal or I go...
546000	557000	That's why. Because I am still nervous and I'm still kind of like... I need to shake off all those feelings.
558000	564000	The wheezes were cute. Thank you. I'm glad you think so.
564000	576000	I was scared. I didn't want to be rude because Strani was talking and then Azora was going to talk about her stuff.
576000	582000	And I tried so hard not to laugh. And my body just kept laughing and laughing.
582000	588000	And I could not stop. It was so hard to physically stop my body from laughing.
588000	593000	And I just couldn't. So it was wrong.
594000	598000	How are you, Cobb? I'm doing pretty good.
599000	605000	I feel like I need to take a deep breath and slowly relax.
605000	615000	I feel like every time I talk right now, I'm overthinking every single thing that I'm saying right now to the point where I'm saying something.
615000	622000	And at the same time in my brain, I'm like, oh no, what the fuck are you saying? Oh no, you sound so stupid.
622000	628000	Oh no, shut up. Oh no, this and that. And I'm trying so hard to make my brain stop.
628000	636000	I'm really overwhelmed. So it will take me a few strings before I can get the groove of things.
636000	645000	So I apologize in advance if I'm really all over the place.
645000	652000	No, I sound so cute right now. Thank you, Yumi. I appreciate it.
653000	660000	Okay, well, I guess let's get started. Before we get started though.
660000	668000	On yesterday's debut, I realized that I didn't really show off my full body.
668000	675000	So I'm kind of wondering if I should do that right now. Would you guys like me to start with that?
675000	683000	Because I feel like I zoomed in on my face, but I didn't really show my full body.
683000	686000	So I don't know if that's something you're interested in seeing.
690000	696000	Okay, okay, okay. Hold on, let me put myself in front.
699000	702000	Let me put myself over here.
705000	708000	Oh no, what the hell.
715000	720000	Why am I rotated like this? No.
723000	726000	No, why am I rotated like this? No.
727000	730000	I'm trying to... Oh fuck.
730000	736000	Okay, well, at least this is not the debut stream, so whatever.
736000	738000	Oh wow.
739000	741000	Oh wow.
742000	747000	Okay, so this is... Let me stand up on the desk.
750000	753000	So this is what my full body looks like.
753000	757000	And I actually didn't show you guys yesterday,
757000	761000	but I can actually take off my shoes as well.
765000	770000	I can take my shoes off. Yay.
771000	775000	I was thinking, you know, we are literally in my room right now,
775000	778000	and we're all hanging out together.
778000	783000	So why would I wear shoes inside my own house, you know?
783000	786000	So I might just take them off.
787000	796000	Here, have a nice once in a lifetime experience for my feet.
799000	803000	I don't have any nail polish or anything like that on my feet.
803000	806000	I'm just a polar bear.
806000	808000	I don't care about the stuff.
808000	814000	However, if you want to do it for me and you're more than welcome,
814000	816000	that will make it a lot easier on me.
816000	821000	If you want to put nail polish on me, that's fine by me.
821000	824000	And let's zoom in into some other parts.
824000	829000	I know you didn't even get to see my paws, but now you can.
829000	835000	So this is my really nice, juicy size.
835000	839000	And you can see my paws also.
839000	842000	You didn't really get to see that yesterday,
842000	847000	besides when I was showing the slides and stuff,
847000	849000	but now you can.
849000	853000	I'll try to do some streams where I show more of my body
853000	856000	so that you can actually see my paws and stuff like that
856000	862000	whenever I'm gaming and stuff like that.
862000	866000	Also, speaking of paws,
866000	871000	I want to do sometimes paw cam streams.
871000	875000	I think that would be pretty funny to see how clumsy I get
875000	877000	when I try to do things.
877000	887000	Maybe do some paw streams where I try snacks
887000	893000	or maybe paw streams where I write something cute for you
893000	896000	or decorate stuff.
896000	898000	I don't know.
898000	903000	My brain is kind of all over the place right now, but...
903000	905000	But yeah.
905000	909000	Let me get back in my chair.
910000	912000	Mm-hmm.
915000	917000	Whoops.
919000	921000	Okay.
927000	929000	Okay, that's better.
929000	931000	That's better.
931000	937000	I just noticed her belt is a seat belt from a crashed vehicle.
938000	945000	I wouldn't really say a vehicle more from...
945000	949000	If you saw the lore from...
949000	951000	Fuck, I can't talk.
953000	956000	From the plane that crashed.
958000	961000	Also, another thing, I don't know if you guys noticed,
961000	966000	but my necklace is made of teeth.
967000	969000	And I don't know if you know,
969000	973000	but those teeth that I have on my necklace
973000	979000	are actually the teeth from the big beast
979000	982000	in the lore video that I have defeated.
982000	985000	And basically what happened is
985000	988000	after that big event happened,
988000	991000	I took the teeth from that beast,
991000	993000	I made them into a necklace
993000	995000	and I put them around my neck
995000	998000	as a reminder for myself
998000	1004000	that I can defeat the scariest of things
1004000	1008000	and no matter how scared I can get,
1008000	1014000	if I can defeat something as scary and big as that beast,
1014000	1017000	I can defeat anything that scares me
1017000	1020000	and push through it.
1021000	1023000	That's kind of the deeper meaning
1023000	1028000	that this necklace of teeth has for me
1028000	1032000	and I've been wearing it ever since then.
1032000	1038000	Helps remind myself when I'm scared of stuff.
1038000	1040000	Kind of like yesterday.
1040000	1043000	I was so nervous yesterday.
1043000	1045000	I was literally shaking.
1045000	1047000	My hands were shaking.
1047000	1049000	I was trying my best
1049000	1051000	not to ever look at the chat
1051000	1055000	and just pretend that I was doing another mock stream.
1055000	1058000	And I was just like...
1060000	1062000	Let's go through this.
1062000	1065000	Let's do as best as we can
1065000	1068000	and just get this over with.
1068000	1072000	Honestly, it's really nerve-wracking to go first,
1072000	1075000	but at the same time it was nice
1075000	1078000	when I was done,
1078000	1081000	when I was finally done with my debut,
1081000	1084000	it was really nice to be able to just sit back
1084000	1089000	and relax and watch all my other genmates debut
1089000	1094000	and eat nice dinner while they're doing their debuts.
1094000	1098000	I'm honestly so proud of all of my genmates.
1098000	1100000	They're amazing.
1100000	1103000	Everyone is so talented.
1103000	1106000	Whenever we were doing the mock streams and stuff,
1106000	1108000	I was like...
1108000	1110000	Honestly, I was scared.
1110000	1115000	I don't know if scared is the right word,
1115000	1117000	but I was worried.
1117000	1119000	I think worried maybe is...
1119000	1124000	Hold on, let me sit in a more comfy way.
1125000	1128000	Sorry.
1128000	1131000	I'm trying to adjust my stuff
1131000	1134000	and sit in a more comfy position.
1134000	1137000	But yeah, so...
1137000	1142000	When we were doing the mock streams
1142000	1148000	and I saw all the mocks of my genmates and stuff,
1148000	1151000	I was worried.
1152000	1157000	I was worried because they're all so talented.
1157000	1161000	They all have such good ideas
1161000	1164000	and everything that I was really worried.
1164000	1167000	I was like, oh no, I go first
1167000	1173000	and I'm gonna have the most boring and shitty debut.
1173000	1177000	So I was making me really worried
1177000	1179000	and stuff like that.
1179000	1182000	They're all so sweet and kind to me
1182000	1187000	and reassured me that it is good
1187000	1193000	and that everything is going to be okay.
1193000	1198000	There's really...
1198000	1202000	There's really not enough words for me to describe
1202000	1205000	just how amazing these girls are.
1205000	1208000	They're all so sweet, so supportive.
1208000	1212000	Also talented.
1212000	1214000	I really love them
1214000	1216000	and I appreciate any time
1216000	1218000	that they have helped me
1218000	1221000	or gave me courage
1221000	1224000	or gave me reassurance whenever.
1224000	1226000	I second yes myself
1226000	1229000	but get really insecure
1229000	1232000	and stuff like that.
1232000	1236000	But debuts are extremely nerve wracking.
1236000	1238000	They definitely are
1238000	1242000	because it's supposed to be this big day
1242000	1246000	where you want to make a good impression
1246000	1249000	and you want to do the best that you can.
1249000	1252000	I tried my best.
1252000	1256000	I tried to do the best with what I have
1256000	1261000	and I hope that it was at least good enough
1261000	1269000	or okay to be enjoyable to watch.
1269000	1272000	Sorry I keep taking deep breaths.
1272000	1277000	I talk so much that I forget to breathe in the middle.
1277000	1280000	So that's why I take deep breaths
1280000	1283000	because I'm talking so much that
1283000	1287000	I forget to breathe in the middle.
1287000	1290000	Oh my God.
1290000	1292000	It was enjoyable.
1292000	1293000	Thank you.
1293000	1296000	I'm really glad to hear that.
1296000	1301000	There's going to be a lot of yapping today
1301000	1303000	and I hope that's okay with you.
1303000	1305000	There's...
1305000	1306000	Breathe pokey.
1306000	1308000	Okay Amy.
1316000	1319000	I'm gonna do breathing exercises with Amy.
1320000	1326000	She's gonna do a guided meditation for me.
1326000	1331000	Oh my God.
1331000	1332000	Alright.
1332000	1335000	So I wanted to go over some of the slides
1335000	1339000	and some stuff that I didn't have.
1339000	1342000	That I didn't have with my slides yesterday.
1342000	1344000	So as you can already see
1344000	1347000	the slide has been here for like the best
1347000	1350000	22 minutes of me just yapping
1350000	1352000	interesting hobbies.
1352000	1354000	So DJ.
1354000	1357000	As you already probably know from yesterday
1359000	1362000	I enjoy DJing.
1362000	1366000	I'm still very amateur.
1366000	1369000	I'm still learning.
1369000	1372000	But when I tried it for the first time
1372000	1374000	I just completely fell in love with it.
1374000	1376000	It was just so fun.
1376000	1378000	I was like oh my God.
1378000	1381000	Listening to good music
1381000	1385000	and do stuff during and after it.
1385000	1390000	Especially doing transitions between songs.
1390000	1392000	It's just fun for me.
1392000	1394000	I don't know how to explain it.
1394000	1396000	I think sometimes it's one of those things
1396000	1398000	where you have to try it for yourself
1398000	1402000	and then you just end up really liking it.
1402000	1406000	The DJ part was really damn good.
1406000	1408000	Aw, thank you.
1408000	1409000	Thank you.
1409000	1411000	I'm really glad.
1411000	1414000	What made you want to start DJing?
1414000	1417000	So actually what made me start
1417000	1420000	want to try DJing
1420000	1424000	is honestly watching other DJ streamers.
1424000	1427000	I would a lot of times
1427000	1430000	just watch the DJs
1431000	1436000	and some of them had such good vibes.
1436000	1439000	They would have so much energy.
1439000	1441000	They would have all the pretty lights.
1441000	1444000	They would play really good music.
1444000	1450000	They would interact with their viewers as well.
1450000	1454000	I was like that is just so much fun.
1454000	1456000	You get to play cool music.
1456000	1461000	You get to just party and go crazy.
1461000	1464000	And you also get to talk to your viewers
1464000	1468000	and basically feel in a way like you're partying with them.
1468000	1470000	And stuff like that.
1470000	1475000	So for me it was like the more I watched other DJ streamers
1475000	1477000	the more I was like wow.
1477000	1480000	I really want to try to do that.
1480000	1483000	I want to see if I like it
1483000	1487000	and maybe do DJ streams sometime in the future
1487000	1490000	and I started getting more and more into it
1490000	1494000	and now it's going to be one of those stuff
1494000	1499000	that I would like to do at least once a week.
1499000	1503000	If not once a week
1503000	1508000	then once every other week and that makes sense.
1508000	1510000	I don't know. It depends.
1510000	1512000	I guess it depends on how I'm feeling that week
1512000	1515000	because you don't need to have a lot of energy
1515000	1517000	and be super hype and stuff.
1517000	1521000	If you DJ you can't really be like
1521000	1524000	oh hi guys.
1524000	1526000	Yeah let's DJ.
1526000	1528000	And then I turn on the music
1528000	1531000	and I'm not talking the entire time
1531000	1535000	and I'm not interacting with any of you.
1535000	1538000	Like you know what I mean?
1538000	1540000	That would be just so boring.
1541000	1544000	At that point why even DJ?
1544000	1546000	At that point why even DJ?
1549000	1551000	I also saw
1553000	1554000	Emi
1557000	1561000	write 3D rave with ICS the DJ please
1561000	1563000	and actually that is
1563000	1567000	that is actually one of my goals
1567000	1569000	one of my biggest goals
1571000	1574000	is to one day when we have
1574000	1576000	3D models
1576000	1578000	is to hopefully
1578000	1580000	I don't know how possible that would be
1580000	1583000	but I say don't let your dreams
1583000	1585000	stay dreams you know
1585000	1586000	make them a reality
1586000	1589000	and one of my biggest dreams and goals
1589000	1591000	being here in BLR is
1591000	1594000	once we have 3D models
1594000	1599000	to eventually have this really really huge event
1599000	1603000	where we will have like IRL venue
1603000	1606000	where you could come into that venue
1606000	1608000	and buy tickets
1608000	1611000	and see me and all the other girls
1611000	1613000	in 3D interact with you
1613000	1615000	while I DJ
1615000	1617000	while we all party together
1617000	1620000	and you will be able to also watch it
1620000	1623000	live online as well
1623000	1625000	as it happens
1625000	1627000	that is my biggest dream
1628000	1631000	it would just be so cool you know
1631000	1633000	I just think it would be so cool
1633000	1635000	because right now
1635000	1639000	there is like 3D VTuber concerts and stuff
1639000	1643000	but I haven't seen anyone do yet
1643000	1647000	like a cool party
1647000	1650000	with like a DJ
1650000	1652000	and dancing
1652000	1654000	and like that kind of interaction
1654000	1656000	and I don't know just
1656000	1659000	something that
1659000	1662000	that's one of my big dreams
1662000	1665000	I think it would be extremely fun
1665000	1668000	also whenever I get 3D in general
1668000	1671000	there's just so many things that I want to do
1671000	1675000	I want to do dancing streams
1675000	1677000	because I like to dance
1677000	1679000	not professionally
1679000	1681000	not professionally or anything
1681000	1683000	I just enjoy dancing it's fun
1683000	1685000	so when I have 3D I would like to do some streams
1685000	1688000	where I just dance to like different songs
1688000	1693000	or DJ in like a 3D like place
1693000	1697000	and explore different worlds
1697000	1700000	and I just think
1700000	1703000	I just think there's so many things
1703000	1706000	that you can do when you are 3D you know
1706000	1709000	like generally there's
1709000	1712000	the options are limitless
1712000	1714000	another thing that I would like to do
1715000	1718000	another idea that I had
1718000	1721000	is we would have like a 3D summer event
1721000	1724000	when me and all my gen mates
1724000	1727000	we would all be in 3D
1727000	1729000	but it would be like a summer event
1729000	1732000	so I would play a lot of house music
1732000	1735000	for that you know summer vibe
1735000	1738000	and we would be at like a 3D area
1738000	1740000	that would have like a pool
1740000	1743000	and look like all exotic and summery
1743000	1745000	while I play some music
1745000	1747000	and we are all in swimsuits
1747000	1749000	or bikinis
1749000	1751000	and we interact with you
1751000	1754000	and we party and we have fun
1754000	1757000	really another thing that I would
1757000	1759000	I would really really love to do like
1759000	1761000	a 3D pool party
1761000	1763000	with music
1765000	1768000	so I can't believe how much I've been yapping already
1770000	1772000	I need to remember to breathe
1774000	1777000	ok so
1777000	1779000	honestly I don't know
1779000	1781000	if I even need to go over it
1781000	1783000	like I wrote napping but like
1783000	1785000	who cares
1788000	1791000	like why did I think it's a good idea to
1791000	1794000	to write that like
1794000	1797000	ok and
1797000	1800000	you like napping I mean ok
1801000	1803000	what about
1803000	1805000	who cares
1805000	1807000	I don't know I'm stupid
1807000	1809000	I was really overwhelmed
1809000	1811000	but yeah I like taking naps
1811000	1814000	and usually I like to take naps before stream
1814000	1817000	so that I can wake up feeling more energized
1819000	1821000	oh my god
1821000	1824000	we enjoy the yap don't worry
1824000	1827000	thank you I'm glad to hear that
1828000	1831000	where's your favorite place to nap
1831000	1834000	I mean the bed obviously
1837000	1839000	I also
1840000	1842000	like to cook sometimes
1842000	1844000	I need to be in the right
1844000	1847000	mood for it most of the time though
1847000	1850000	I'll be honest most of the time I'm not in the mood for cooking
1850000	1853000	but when I am I can make some
1853000	1855000	pretty good stuff
1855000	1858000	yesterday I made
1860000	1863000	rice with chicken curry
1863000	1866000	and it was so yummy and delicious
1866000	1869000	I actually wanted to take a picture of that
1869000	1872000	but I forgot like
1872000	1874000	cause I ate it for lunch
1874000	1876000	and that's when I took the nap
1876000	1878000	I was extremely sleepy
1878000	1881000	I mean your loading screen has a cooking
1881000	1884000	yeah it does so I think it fits pretty well
1886000	1888000	hmm
1889000	1892000	and then next we have
1892000	1894000	ASMR
1894000	1897000	I'm actually gonna do an ASMR stream
1897000	1899000	this week
1899000	1902000	and I want you to know
1902000	1905000	like in advance
1905000	1907000	that
1907000	1910000	until I move out
1910000	1913000	which is gonna be probably around September
1913000	1916000	sadly I can't do anything
1916000	1919000	like soundproofing or anything like that
1919000	1921000	so
1921000	1924000	when I do ASMR streams
1924000	1927000	if you ever hear something from outside
1927000	1930000	or my neighbors from upstairs
1930000	1933000	the 3DO picks up
1933000	1936000	them like walking upstairs sometimes
1936000	1939000	or doing stuff it's honestly
1939000	1942000	insane how it just picks up things from the outside
1942000	1945000	it's like next time but
1945000	1948000	I'll try to see if maybe I can put
1948000	1951000	like maybe
1951000	1954000	thunder or
1960000	1963000	maybe rain sounds in the background
1963000	1966000	so that you can't
1966000	1969000	hear the background noise as much
1969000	1972000	basically
1972000	1975000	I just wanted to give a heads up
1975000	1978000	that until around September
1978000	1981000	that's my situation, that's my living situation
1981000	1984000	and I will still do my very best
1984000	1987000	to give you a good ASMR experience
1987000	1990000	and make do with what I have
1990000	1993000	basically and I hope that you'll enjoy it
1993000	1996000	I've enjoyed ASMR
1996000	1999000	for a very long time
1999000	2002000	for years now
2002000	2005000	and whenever I found out about it
2005000	2008000	that's when I felt those
2008000	2011000	those ASMR tingles and
2011000	2014000	I was like wow what is that feeling
2014000	2017000	and the thing is I have experienced ASMR
2017000	2020000	before I even knew what ASMR is
2020000	2023000	like I would get sometimes
2023000	2026000	tingles from certain sounds
2026000	2029000	but I never really knew what that sensation is
2029000	2032000	or if there's a name for it
2032000	2035000	so when I found out about ASMR
2035000	2038000	I was like wow
2038000	2041000	this is exactly the same feeling
2041000	2044000	that I got
2044000	2047000	back then
2047000	2050000	and so the more I started listening to ASMR
2050000	2053000	the more I was like
2053000	2056000	this sounds fun
2056000	2059000	I think it would be really cool to try making ASMR myself
2059000	2062000	and
2062000	2065000	try to make sounds
2065000	2068000	with different items
2068000	2071000	and seeing
2071000	2074000	what sounds they make because the cool thing about ASMR
2074000	2077000	is that
2077000	2080000	sometimes you can find an item
2080000	2083000	to make sounds with
2083000	2086000	and it can actually produce
2086000	2089000	many different sounds more than one
2089000	2092000	depending on how you tap it or how you hold it
2092000	2095000	or how you play around with it
2095000	2098000	and that's another thing that I always found cool
2098000	2101000	so sometimes I would go to random stores
2101000	2104000	and I would literally start tapping different items
2104000	2107000	or grab them
2107000	2110000	or move them around my ear
2110000	2113000	to see if it would make for a good sound
2113000	2116000	and stuff
2116000	2119000	so yeah
2119000	2122000	I'm definitely excited
2122000	2125000	to do nice ASMR
2125000	2128000	for you
2128000	2131000	and I really hope that you will enjoy it
2131000	2134000	I'm definitely going to have to
2137000	2140000	I'm definitely going to have to
2140000	2143000	make my collection bigger and bigger
2143000	2146000	I want to have an ASMR tingle box
2146000	2149000	where I will place
2149000	2152000	all the products that I'll be using to make ASMR
2152000	2155000	sounds with
2155000	2158000	so every time that I stream I can bring my tingle box
2158000	2161000	and play around with it
2161000	2164000	and make nice sounds with it
2164000	2167000	another thing
2167000	2170000	I know that ASMR also includes
2170000	2173000	whispering
2173000	2176000	and heartbeats
2176000	2179000	and sometimes
2179000	2182000	I also love to give hugs
2182000	2185000	so sometimes I will give you a hug
2185000	2188000	or a whisper
2188000	2191000	or maybe even say something
2191000	2194000	in Russian
2194000	2197000	I think I actually saw a Maro
2197000	2200000	asking me if there will be Russian
2200000	2203000	in my ASMR
2203000	2206000	and the answer is
2206000	2209000	during my ASMR streams
2209000	2212000	if there's ever a request
2212000	2215000	here we speak Russian
2215000	2218000	in my ASMR streams I could try
2218000	2221000	and do that sometimes
2221000	2224000	or take requests
2224000	2227000	something dirty
2227000	2230000	no
2230000	2233000	no Emi
2233000	2236000	I'm on YouTube
2236000	2239000	I need to be careful
2239000	2242000	you should be careful too
2242000	2245000	unless
2245000	2248000	you know maybe
2248000	2251000	okay listen maybe once we have
2251000	2254000	memberships open
2254000	2257000	maybe ASMR
2257000	2260000	membership ASMR streams
2260000	2263000	maybe there
2263000	2266000	I could get away with a little bit more
2266000	2269000	if it's also on archives
2269000	2272000	I don't know
2272000	2275000	YouTube has been
2275000	2278000	YouTube has been really weird lately
2278000	2281000	I'm just trying my best not to get in trouble
2281000	2284000	at the moment but
2284000	2287000	we'll see what happens
2290000	2293000	I also like to
2293000	2296000	make funny duels sometimes
2296000	2299000	I don't do that all the much
2299000	2302000	but when I do I have a lot of fun with it
2302000	2305000	so I'm thinking of maybe doing
2305000	2308000	eventually like a stream where
2308000	2311000	I
2311000	2314000	fuck my brain
2314000	2317000	oh my god
2317000	2320000	where I will
2320000	2323000	draw a customized version
2323000	2326000	of each
2326000	2329000	and every member that joins
2329000	2332000	on my membership
2332000	2335000	on my membership stream
2335000	2338000	I think maybe it would be a cute idea
2338000	2341000	if like I drew some
2341000	2344000	custom snowberries
2344000	2347000	for each and every person that joins
2347000	2350000	the membership
2350000	2353000	I don't know why I'm struggling so hard to talk
2353000	2356000	I really don't
2356000	2359000	I think it's because I also didn't talk for this long
2359000	2362000	in a very long time
2362000	2365000	like I really don't talk much
2365000	2368000	oh my god
2368000	2371000	a doodle stream while you're DJing would be cute
2371000	2374000	I can't do that
2375000	2378000	I need to
2378000	2381000	I need to have focus on the DJing when I DJ
2381000	2384000	that wouldn't be
2384000	2387000	possible
2387000	2390000	but it could be like a separate stream idea
2390000	2393000	where sometimes I do these stupid doodles
2393000	2396000	streams where I take requests
2396000	2399000	and draw the weirdest
2399000	2402000	ugliest things that I can
2404000	2407000	DJing requires two hands doesn't it
2407000	2410000	yeah it does
2410000	2413000	the thing is right now I don't even have a DJ deck
2413000	2416000	so my skills are not even fully
2416000	2419000	unleashed I use virtual
2419000	2422000	fuck I can't fucking talk
2422000	2425000	I use
2425000	2428000	I use
2428000	2431000	I use virtual
2431000	2434000	virtual
2434000	2437000	DJ in order to DJ
2437000	2440000	but that means I can really only use
2440000	2443000	mainly one hand
2443000	2446000	and I want to get an actual
2446000	2449000	DJ deck so that I can use both my hands
2449000	2452000	it will make it easier to mix
2452000	2455000	the songs as well in between
2455000	2458000	so that is something
2461000	2464000	that I would like to get eventually
2464000	2467000	so I can improve
2467000	2470000	I feel like not having a DJ deck
2470000	2473000	definitely limits my skills
2473000	2476000	or my ability to improve on it
2476000	2479000	uh
2479000	2482000	virtual DJ that's not what I said
2482000	2485000	I said virtual DJ
2485000	2488000	oh my god
2489000	2492000	oh my god
2492000	2495000	okay and then
2495000	2498000	oh god I'm gonna be here forever
2498000	2501000	one hand in DJing
2501000	2504000	wait a minute that's not what you think
2504000	2507000	no not like that
2507000	2510000	no I need to be on focus
2510000	2513000	I need to be on focus you know why
2513000	2516000	because I have had times when like
2516000	2519000	I was DJing and I would get
2519000	2522000	song to the music that I would actually forget to DJ
2522000	2525000	and then the song would end and I didn't do like
2525000	2528000	a transition to like another song
2528000	2531000	and I didn't mix in between so there was like complete silence
2531000	2534000	and I was like what the fuck
2534000	2537000	so no no no no I need to be fully focused
2537000	2540000	on my DJ streams because I don't want that to happen
2540000	2543000	it's so it's so embarrassing
2543000	2546000	I can't help myself some music is just so good
2546000	2549000	that I just get very into it
2549000	2552000	especially when I drink
2552000	2555000	like imagine you listen to good music and you drink
2555000	2558000	it's very easy to lose focus
2558000	2561000	to lose focus of yourself when you do those things
2563000	2566000	and then another thing
2566000	2569000	that's in my interest is retro games
2569000	2572000	I really really love retro games
2572000	2575000	it's a big part of my childhood
2575000	2578000	I will say though retro games
2578000	2581000	is not the only stuff that I will be playing
2581000	2584000	I will have like a game or two
2584000	2587000	that is more modern
2587000	2590000	or not retro
2590000	2593000	I like to try all types of different games
2593000	2596000	and if I think that I will like something I will play it
2596000	2599000	but if you do see quite a bit
2599000	2602000	of retro games and stuff like that
2602000	2605000	some weeks
2605000	2608000	that's why because I really love retro games
2608000	2611000	and there's
2611000	2614000	a lot of games that I would actually like to play
2614000	2617000	on stream
2617000	2620000	let me see
2620000	2623000	actually brought that up
2623000	2626000	there it is, here is a big listing
2626000	2629000	of some of my all time favorite
2629000	2632000	retro games actually
2632000	2635000	American McGee's Alice
2635000	2638000	it's actually the first game that comes between
2638000	2641000	before
2641000	2644000	excuse me
2644000	2647000	that
2647000	2650000	that comes before Alice Madras returns
2650000	2653000	and I actually think that this game
2653000	2656000	is even better than the second one
2656000	2659000	it's one of my all time favorites
2659000	2662000	Jazz Jack Rabbit 2
2662000	2665000	another game that's
2665000	2668000	one of my biggest childhood games
2668000	2671000	Blood Rain
2671000	2674000	all of these games here
2674000	2677000	I would be really happy to play them
2677000	2680000	so if you see anything
2680000	2683000	that you remember
2683000	2686000	or anything that looks like it would be fun
2686000	2689000	or you're excited about
2689000	2692000	then I hope you will
2692000	2695000	I hope you will enjoy watching me play those games
2695000	2698000	I really love the Tomb Raider series
2698000	2701000	all of them
2701000	2704000	but I will say though that I'm very bad at it
2704000	2707000	even in the past
2707000	2710000	when I played it as a kid
2710000	2713000	I was always bad at it
2713000	2716000	to the point that I would look for cheats
2716000	2719000	to skip certain levels
2719000	2722000	I'm just so bad at this game I don't know what it is
2722000	2725000	but I get lost very easily in games
2725000	2728000	very easily and I'm also
2728000	2731000	I'm also bad at puzzles as well
2731000	2734000	so I don't know
2734000	2737000	I love those games but I'm also too dumb to play them
2737000	2740000	that's basically what it is
2740000	2743000	and back then in Tomb Raider games
2743000	2746000	they didn't have maps
2746000	2749000	they didn't have a thing that showed you where to go next
2749000	2752000	or what to do so sometimes I would literally
2752000	2755000	spend hours and hours just circling
2755000	2758000	around the entire place
2758000	2761000	and not getting anywhere
2761000	2764000	so I was like fuck this shit I'm gonna use a cheat code
2764000	2767000	and I'm just gonna skip to the next level
2767000	2770000	so I can make progress
2770000	2773000	will I love for back seating
2773000	2776000	then to help you out
2776000	2779000	there's definitely games
2779000	2782000	where I would be more than happy
2782000	2785000	if you help me and tell me where to go
2785000	2788000	or how to solve a puzzle and stuff like that
2789000	2791000	I'll be honest
2791000	2794000	I'm not the smartest
2798000	2801000	I'm not the smartest period
2801000	2804000	I was gonna make like a sentence
2804000	2807000	but I didn't know what to say so I'm just gonna say
2807000	2810000	yeah I'm just not the smartest
2810000	2813000	to say this
2813000	2816000	I'm not good at video games but I guess it's also not surprising
2817000	2820000	I only recently came to the civilization
2824000	2827000	also I don't know if you noticed
2827000	2830000	but I also have Barbie Explorer
2830000	2833000	in my list
2833000	2836000	and the reason why it's another favorite for me
2836000	2839000	is because that game actually felt a lot like Tomb Raider
2839000	2842000	but
2842000	2845000	for babies basically
2845000	2848000	Tomb Raider but Barbie Edition
2848000	2851000	that is for
2851000	2854000	you know
2854000	2857000	for not so smart
2857000	2860000	challenged cubs like me
2860000	2863000	so that game was a lot easier
2863000	2866000	for me to play because
2866000	2869000	it was a lot easier obviously
2869000	2872000	but it still had a lot of Tomb Raider elements
2872000	2875000	so I enjoyed it a lot
2875000	2878000	GTA, Vice City
2878000	2881000	another really amazing game
2881000	2884000	that I love a lot
2884000	2887000	definitely one of my favorites, definitely a game I wanna play on stream
2889000	2892000	I'm definitely excited to
2892000	2895000	do GTA Vice City streams
2895000	2898000	I feel like it would be really funny
2898000	2901000	to do them
2901000	2904000	and when they showed
2904000	2907000	the trailer for the newest
2907000	2910000	GTA that's also in Vice City
2910000	2913000	but with the high graphics
2913000	2916000	and everything that will be available
2916000	2919000	either next
2919000	2922000	I can't remember, I think it's gonna be ready in like
2922000	2925000	2 years
2925000	2928000	I can't remember but the trailer looked so fucking good
2928000	2931000	and I'm so excited to play it whenever it does come out
2931000	2934000	yeah GTA 6
2934000	2937000	GTA 6 is gonna be wild and seeing Vice City
2937000	2940000	in almost like high graphics
2940000	2943000	I was like wow
2943000	2946000	look Vice City is looking so freaking good
2946000	2949000	I'm just so freaking high for it
2949000	2952000	it's gonna be amazing
2952000	2955000	but until then
2955000	2958000	GTA Vice City
2958000	2961000	and maybe even GTA San Andreas
2961000	2964000	are the 2 GTA games
2964000	2967000	that I would really love to play on stream
2967000	2970000	I think that would be really fun
2970000	2973000	lots of stuff to do
2973000	2976000	then we also have
2976000	2979000	ok so the thing is
2979000	2983000	silent hill
2983000	2986000	3
2986000	2989000	I remember getting this game
2989000	2992000	and wanting to play it really really badly
2992000	2995000	but I was too scared
2995000	2998000	I remember playing some levels during the day
2998000	3001000	to make it as least scary as possible
3001000	3004000	and I beat some levels
3004000	3007000	but I was too scared
3007000	3010000	I wonder if I play Silent Hill 3
3010000	3013000	on stream with your help
3013000	3016000	if maybe that would help me feel less scared
3016000	3019000	then maybe it could help me figure out
3019000	3022000	where to go
3022000	3025000	and how to solve puzzles
3025000	3028000	and all that stuff
3028000	3032000	cause I wanna like play through all of it
3032000	3035000	because it genuinely just looks so good
3035000	3038000	and cool but I'm scared
3038000	3041000	I'm too scared
3041000	3044000	I need my snowberries
3044000	3047000	to help me
3047000	3050000	and protect me
3050000	3053000	you get to prove your own growth
3053000	3056000	yeah I guess we'll see about that
3056000	3059000	there's also
3059000	3062000	there's also
3062000	3065000	there's also another one on this list
3066000	3069000	Drakan
3069000	3072000	Order of the Flames
3072000	3075000	another really good retro game
3075000	3078000	that I remember playing
3078000	3081000	but I never got to finish it because I remember
3081000	3084000	I was kinda near the end
3084000	3087000	at least I believe I was but I could never beat the level
3087000	3090000	because I think there was a puzzle or something
3090000	3093000	and I just could not figure it out
3093000	3096000	so I got to play it on stream
3096000	3099000	and hopefully actually get to finish the game
3099000	3102000	and see the ending
3102000	3105000	and you know I just think it will be
3105000	3108000	a very very nice experience to play all of these
3108000	3111000	childhood games
3111000	3114000	with you by my side
3114000	3117000	so I can talk about these games and play them
3117000	3120000	and have fun also I have the sims
3121000	3124000	I really want to make a household
3124000	3127000	in the sims of me and my gen mates
3127000	3130000	I think that would make for a really really fun stream
3130000	3133000	where it will be
3133000	3136000	excuse me
3136000	3139000	where it will be all six of us in a household
3139000	3142000	doing different things
3142000	3145000	definitely want to do that
3145000	3148000	I'll be honest
3149000	3152000	I want to play all of these games
3152000	3155000	at some point on stream so
3155000	3158000	there will obviously be other games that are now listed here
3158000	3161000	that I will
3161000	3164000	that I will play lakas in a pool and drown us
3164000	3167000	in me
3167000	3170000	I don't think I want to do stuff like that
3170000	3173000	not to my beloved friends anyways
3173000	3176000	not to my beloved friends
3176000	3179000	but I might do it to other people
3179000	3182000	depending on what happens
3182000	3185000	because the sims
3185000	3188000	the sims has an expansion pack
3188000	3191000	I think with
3191000	3194000	celebrities and stuff
3194000	3197000	and sometimes when you get very famous
3197000	3200000	sometimes you get a stalker
3200000	3203000	in your house
3203000	3206000	I think what will make for a fun content is
3206000	3209000	if we lock the stalker in a room
3209000	3212000	and then either burn him
3212000	3215000	or drown him in the water
3215000	3218000	or just like
3218000	3221000	figure out some funny things to do
3221000	3224000	that stalker me
3224000	3227000	I hope not
3227000	3230000	because your life will be ending very soon
3230000	3233000	what's wrong with VLurgers?
3233000	3236000	nothing, we are all amazing
3236000	3239000	there's nothing wrong with us
3239000	3242000	we are perfect
3242000	3245000	bruh she's gonna water board us
3245000	3248000	let's go
3248000	3251000	I need to be with the reaper
3256000	3259000	yes you do
3259000	3262000	sims 1 has very limited interactions
3262000	3265000	with the reaper
3265000	3268000	we are mentally ill
3268000	3271000	but I think it adds to our perfection
3271000	3274000	because what is a VTuber without mental illness?
3274000	3277000	bland and boring
3277000	3280000	that's right
3280000	3283000	sorry I don't know why I said that but I mean
3283000	3286000	it does add to our personality
3286000	3289000	you know
3289000	3292000	sorry
3292000	3295000	for saying weird things
3295000	3298000	I don't know what I'm doing
3301000	3304000	oh my god

3334000	3337000	vlog

3364000	3367000	it doesn't mean anything
3367000	3370000	anyways
3370000	3373000	here is a list of some of my most
3373000	3376000	favorite anime
3376000	3379000	happy sugar life
3379000	3382000	mitsudemoe kanon
3382000	3385000	2006
3385000	3388000	kurejime dg charat
3388000	3391000	ok I will say dg charat
3391000	3394000	I loved it so much and I'm so sad that
3394000	3397000	the original series
3397000	3400000	was like
3400000	3403000	each episode was just 5 minutes
3403000	3406000	because I tried to watch
3406000	3409000	other seasons
3409000	3412000	where they have full episodes
3412000	3415000	but they don't have the same art style
3415000	3418000	as the original dg charat
3418000	3421000	and so it just didn't hit the same
3421000	3424000	so I was like
3424000	3427000	I was like man that sucks
3427000	3430000	because I was enjoying it so much
3430000	3433000	and I just love how back then
3433000	3436000	they made the funniest expressions
3436000	3439000	back then in anime
3439000	3442000	one of the stuff that I love about older anime
3442000	3445000	is how the art style looked
3445000	3448000	and also
3449000	3452000	and also how
3452000	3455000	the expressions that they drew
3455000	3458000	I don't know they just have so much life
3458000	3461000	they just have so much soul
3461000	3464000	they don't make them like that anymore
3467000	3470000	then there is akunohana
3470000	3473000	there is nana
3473000	3476000	ichigo machimato
3476000	3479000	definitely an anime
3479000	3482000	that I want to do a watch along with
3482000	3485000	if you would like to join me
3485000	3488000	there is a couple of anime here
3488000	3491000	that I really want to do a watch along with you all
3491000	3494000	I think it would be really nice to
3494000	3497000	cozy up and watch some nice anime together
3497000	3500000	and this is definitely one of the ones that I would like
3500000	3503000	it's just really nice and cozy
3503000	3506000	elf and light
3506000	3509000	such a good anime
3509000	3512000	honestly
3512000	3515000	it's weird back then I used to be able to watch
3515000	3518000	really
3518000	3521000	what's the word
3521000	3524000	I'm trying to say
3524000	3527000	hard to watch
3527000	3530000	maybe or
3530000	3533000	let's just say
3533000	3536000	for me now
3536000	3539000	I don't know if I would be able to rewatch it
3539000	3542000	because I feel like it would just make me cry
3542000	3545000	and make me too sad
3545000	3548000	but back then I was able to watch stuff like that
3548000	3551000	without any problem it's really weird
3551000	3554000	it's like I develop emotions
3554000	3557000	it's like I develop emotions now
3557000	3560000	now that I'm here in civilization
3560000	3563000	suddenly I'm feeling emotions
3563000	3566000	and I can't watch some stuff that I used to watch
3566000	3569000	I can't fucking talk
3569000	3572000	I don't master Cinderella girls
3572000	3575000	you 149
3575000	3578000	another one I would love to do a watch along with
3578000	3581000	another one that I want to do a watch along with
3581000	3584000	it's so funny I love it
3584000	3587000	I don't think I'll do a watch along with that
3587000	3590000	the thing for me with Made on Abyss
3590000	3593000	it is such a freaking good anime
3593000	3596000	but it is too hard breaking for me to
3596000	3599000	rewatch it
3599000	3602000	I remember crying so much watching it
3602000	3605000	I felt like I'm gonna get into depression
3605000	3608000	or something after watching it
3608000	3611000	I don't want to risk that
3611000	3614000	it's just too sad to watch again
3614000	3617000	but it is extremely extremely good anime
3617000	3620000	the story is very good
3620000	3623000	but my heart is just too soft
3623000	3626000	to rewatch stuff like that
3626000	3629000	as a mankadeyo
3629000	3632000	another good anime
3632000	3635000	and a huge huge favorite of mine
3635000	3638000	I just remember so many good memories watching it
3639000	3642000	I think it would be genuinely so so fun
3642000	3645000	school days
3645000	3648000	another good anime
3648000	3650000	the ending
3650000	3653000	I love the ending it was so good
3653000	3656000	another really good and funny one
3656000	3659000	that I used to enjoy a lot
3659000	3662000	I also remember
3662000	3665000	NHK
3665000	3668000	Yugosl
3668000	3671000	another big anime
3671000	3674000	that was one of my favorites
3674000	3677000	I don't know if it sounds cringe
3677000	3680000	but welcome to the NHK
3680000	3683000	sorry
3683000	3686000	fuck I can't talk
3691000	3694000	I'm talking so much that I feel like I'm eating my words
3694000	3697000	and like I can't talk
3697000	3700000	okay okay
3700000	3703000	okay
3703000	3706000	okay
3706000	3709000	they are being
3709000	3712000	okay
3712000	3715000	so when I watched
3715000	3718000	welcome to the NHK
3718000	3721000	I don't know if it's cringe
3721000	3724000	but
3724000	3727000	you know the girl in the anime
3727000	3730000	that he talks to the girl with the short hair
3730000	3733000	that's wearing a white yellow t-shirt
3733000	3736000	I can't remember what her name is
3736000	3739000	but I remember watching this anime
3739000	3742000	and being like
3742000	3745000	yeah she saw me
3745000	3748000	one day I'm gonna find a guy just like that
3748000	3751000	and I'm gonna fix
3754000	3757000	I'm gonna be just like her
3757000	3760000	and then I'm gonna find someone to fix
3760000	3763000	and then there's like that scene
3763000	3766000	at the end
3766000	3769000	where she's really sad
3769000	3772000	and I think I can't remember
3772000	3775000	but correct me if I'm wrong
3775000	3778000	she is you know really depressed
3778000	3781000	and sad as well
3781000	3784000	and I think she is like about to
3784000	3787000	end her life I think
3787000	3790000	and I was like oh my god that's literally me
3790000	3793000	I would like literally watch that episode
3793000	3796000	while I was crying and I was like
3796000	3799000	it's literally me
3799000	3802000	they made this anime about me
3802000	3805000	oh my god
3810000	3813000	yeah um I relate
3813000	3816000	I relate it too hard too
3816000	3819000	she's literally me
3822000	3825000	oh my god yeah that was one of those
3825000	3828000	moments where I look back on
3828000	3831000	and I'm kinda cringing
3832000	3835000	I can't fix each other
3835000	3838000	you never know we might
3838000	3841000	I'm hopeful
3841000	3844000	I'm hopeful for the future
3844000	3847000	in the book he fixes her
3847000	3850000	yeah I was like oh my god that's so romantic
3850000	3853000	I really wanted him to kiss her
3853000	3856000	in that scene I was like oh my god I hope they kiss
3856000	3859000	I hope they kiss
3859000	3862000	it makes each other by being together
3865000	3868000	and then love life
3868000	3871000	I love
3871000	3874000	why does that sentence sound so weird to say
3874000	3877000	I love love life
3877000	3880000	I'm probably overthinking it
3880000	3883000	I really love the love life series
3883000	3886000	I've watched all the seasons
3886000	3889000	I've loved every single one of them
3889000	3892000	and I might go watch along
3892000	3895000	of those as well
3895000	3898000	who is your love life best girl
3898000	3901000	for each generation
3901000	3904000	it's a different girl
3904000	3907000	so for me
3907000	3910000	in the first generation
3910000	3913000	honestly first generation is so good
3913000	3916000	it's hard to pick a favorite
3916000	3919000	but whenever I played the rhythm
3919000	3922000	love life game
3922000	3925000	I would always make sure to get
3925000	3928000	the ultra rare cards
3928000	3931000	for Niko's birthday
3931000	3934000	and Allie
3934000	3937000	I used to really like Allie because
3937000	3940000	she is part Russian
3940000	3943000	and she loves chocolate a lot
3943000	3946000	and I was like oh my god she is literally me
3946000	3949000	but her personality wasn't really me
3949000	3952000	but because
3952000	3955000	she was part Russian
3955000	3958000	and because
3958000	3961000	she would really love chocolate
3961000	3964000	I was like she is literally me
3964000	3967000	I think
3967000	3970000	I think now I would probably be closer
3973000	3976000	I would probably be closer to Niko
3976000	3979000	to be honest
3979000	3982000	but I don't have my sweet moments
3982000	3985000	as well so I would
3985000	3988000	I would definitely have to be like a mix between Niko
3988000	3991000	and like another girl
3991000	3994000	but I'm not sure who
3994000	3997000	maybe Rin
3997000	4000000	because I don't know if you ever watched
4000000	4003000	love life but
4003000	4006000	in the first generation
4006000	4009000	there is an episode about Rin
4009000	4012000	where
4012000	4015000	where she really wants to
4015000	4018000	feel girly
4018000	4021000	and cute and she struggles
4021000	4024000	to feel that way
4024000	4027000	and I can't remember
4027000	4030000	in details about the episode but basically
4030000	4033000	she feels like she is not cute enough
4033000	4036000	but she wants to be
4036000	4039000	and I think at some point of the episode
4039000	4042000	she finally gets to wear a really
4042000	4045000	feminine and super cute
4045000	4048000	freely idol dress
4048000	4051000	for one of her performances
4051000	4054000	and that's when she gets extremely happy
4054000	4057000	and she finally feels cute enough
4057000	4060000	and I really
4060000	4063000	I really relate it to that
4063000	4066000	episode and to her because
4066000	4069000	I would have moments too
4069000	4072000	where I wanted to be
4072000	4075000	extremely cute
4075000	4078000	and I would always worry that
4078000	4081000	I'm not cute enough
4081000	4084000	I don't know, my personality is not cute enough
4084000	4087000	and yeah
4087000	4090000	and that's the thing, I really love
4090000	4093000	girly stuff
4093000	4096000	I really love plushies, I love cute dresses
4096000	4099000	and skirts and all of that stuff
4099000	4102000	and it actually
4102000	4105000	wasn't until later in my life that I started
4105000	4108000	wearing dresses and skirts
4108000	4111000	because
4111000	4114000	in my early life
4114000	4117000	I felt like Rin, you know
4117000	4120000	I felt like I'm not cute enough to wear dresses
4120000	4123000	or skirts and stuff like that
4123000	4126000	but you know the more time went by
4126000	4129000	I started to experiment with
4129000	4132000	wearing dresses and skirts and stuff
4132000	4135000	and now that's pretty much the only thing that I wear
4135000	4138000	I don't have
4138000	4141000	any pants or anything
4141000	4144000	when I go outside I always wear either a skirt
4144000	4147000	or a dress when I go outside
4147000	4150000	so yeah I do wear
4150000	4153000	a bunch of cute stuff these days
4153000	4156000	and yeah that's
4156000	4159000	like one of the stuff that made me think about it
4159000	4162000	so I think
4162000	4165000	I would probably be like a mix between Rin
4165000	4168000	and Nico
4168000	4171000	also because Rin can be pretty hyper
4171000	4174000	and when I have lots of energy I can get super hyper
4174000	4177000	and extremely silly and dumb and that is
4177000	4180000	a big part of her personality as well
4180000	4183000	and then for
4183000	4186000	the second generation
4186000	4189000	for the second generation of love life
4189000	4192000	Ruby
4192000	4195000	Ruby is actually my most favorite one
4195000	4198000	because she is extremely shy and insecure
4198000	4201000	and second guesses herself
4201000	4204000	a lot
4204000	4207000	but she wants to do the best
4207000	4210000	to overcome that
4210000	4213000	and as you read
4213000	4216000	her stuff
4216000	4219000	and as time goes by
4219000	4222000	she gains confidence
4222000	4225000	and gets better and better in what she does
4225000	4228000	and it's really nice to see
4228000	4231000	the development
4231000	4234000	like from how she started
4234000	4237000	versus how she
4237000	4240000	what's the word
4243000	4246000	I'm trying to think of the word
4246000	4249000	I'm trying to say
4249000	4252000	fully develop
4252000	4255000	character development
4255000	4258000	basically she wants
4258000	4261000	from being insecure
4261000	4264000	and shy and second guessing herself
4264000	4267000	to becoming a lot more confident
4267000	4270000	and really shining through
4270000	4273000	and that's how I want to be
4273000	4276000	I want to be the same way
4276000	4279000	and whenever I get insecure and when I second guess myself
4279000	4282000	I think of Ruby and I remind myself
4282000	4285000	that if she did it I can do the same thing
4285000	4288000	and I can grow as well
4288000	4291000	and yeah
4291000	4294000	I really can't wait to see
4294000	4297000	like compare a year from now
4297000	4300000	how much I changed
4300000	4303000	I think it would be really funny if a year from now
4303000	4306000	we rewatched this exact stream
4306000	4309000	and see the difference in how I talk
4309000	4312000	and the difference in my manners
4312000	4315000	and the way that I communicate with you guys
4315000	4318000	I think that would be really funny
4318000	4321000	to be honest
4321000	4324000	because I think there would be a big difference
4324000	4327000	because right now I'm still like saddling in and shy
4327000	4330000	and overwhelmed and nervous
4330000	4333000	and I have moments where I get insecure
4333000	4336000	or second guess myself
4336000	4339000	but I know that we can all grow with time
4339000	4342000	and improve on this thing
4342000	4345000	so yeah
4346000	4348000	lane
4348000	4351000	another good anime
4351000	4354000	all of the anime here are really good
4354000	4357000	I'm just yapping so much that I end up not
4357000	4360000	talking about each and every one of them
4360000	4363000	because I feel like
4363000	4366000	I feel like I'm yapping too much
4366000	4369000	and I'm like who cares
4369000	4372000	shut up who asked
4372000	4375000	like while I'm talking about it
4375000	4378000	I'm just like who asked
4378000	4381000	who cares
4381000	4384000	why was I talking about this
4384000	4387000	no no we love the app
4387000	4390000	we care
4390000	4393000	we asked
4393000	4396000	you're yapping is good
4396000	4399000	we ask thank you very much
4400000	4403000	thank you
4403000	4406000	that's really sweet
4406000	4409000	thank you for saying all that stuff
4409000	4412000	it's really reassuring
4412000	4415000	and helps me
4415000	4418000	gain a little bit more confidence
4418000	4421000	I'm still
4421000	4424000	I know I'm like a big confident
4424000	4427000	like brat on twitter
4427000	4430000	and stuff like that
4430000	4433000	but when I get on stream
4433000	4436000	I'm like
4436000	4439000	I just get all shy
4439000	4442000	I don't know why
4442000	4445000	I don't know why I'm shy
4445000	4448000	why would I be shy
4448000	4451000	of some OGs that are watching me
4451000	4454000	why would I be shy
4454000	4457000	I can't help it
4457000	4460000	I'm really nervous
4460000	4463000	yeah
4463000	4466000	I wish I was naturally confident
4466000	4469000	from day one I wish I did
4469000	4472000	my 2.0 stream today and I was like
4472000	4475000	hello OGs you're all disgusting
4475000	4478000	I don't care about what you say we're gonna be talking about me
4478000	4481000	because that's all that matters
4481000	4484000	and blah blah blah
4484000	4487000	but I don't know I just I
4487000	4490000	I can't do that right now
4490000	4493000	I'm still
4493000	4496000	I'm still
4502000	4505000	I'm still trying to
4505000	4508000	get over my shyness
4509000	4512000	yeah
4512000	4515000	now that you said it you know what I think would be funny
4515000	4518000	I think it would be really funny if like right now
4518000	4521000	a lot of you enjoy my shyness
4521000	4524000	and awkwardness
4524000	4527000	and then once I get more confident
4527000	4530000	you will be like man I miss the days
4530000	4533000	when I see snow paws was so cute
4533000	4536000	and shy and reserved
4537000	4540000	now she's such a bitch
4540000	4543000	now she's such a fucking brat
4543000	4546000	what happened
4548000	4551000	oh no
4551000	4554000	oh no
4554000	4557000	no
4557000	4560000	gap might
4560000	4563000	maybe
4563000	4566000	no
4566000	4569000	kindness doesn't go away
4569000	4572000	maybe I don't know
4572000	4575000	I guess I'm just trying to be
4575000	4578000	my most authentic self
4578000	4581000	there's a sentence
4581000	4584000	that someone once said
4584000	4587000	where it says
4587000	4590000	being your authentic self
4590000	4593000	is your ideal self
4593000	4596000	so whenever I second guess myself
4596000	4599000	or I'm not sure
4599000	4602000	how much to show
4602000	4605000	of myself and stuff like that
4605000	4608000	I think of that
4608000	4611000	sentence and I'm like
4611000	4614000	just be authentic
4614000	4617000	just be as authentic as you can be because that is
4617000	4620000	the most best version of yourself
4620000	4623000	so that's what I'm gonna do
4623000	4626000	and that's just what I'm gonna do
4626000	4629000	and what I think is the best thing to do
4629000	4632000	and that's just like naturally how I am
4632000	4635000	that's the thing with me
4635000	4638000	I've always been like that
4638000	4641000	people around like new people
4641000	4644000	that I'm still getting to know
4644000	4647000	and
4647000	4650000	just start talking to
4650000	4653000	I'm always more shy and reserved
4653000	4656000	but then once you get to know me
4656000	4659000	and I get really comfortable around you
4659000	4662000	I just become a man
4662000	4665000	sometimes and I just become extra ready
4665000	4668000	and that's when you will see all of those
4668000	4671000	sides of me shine more
4671000	4674000	this small period of time
4674000	4677000	where I'm feeling still
4677000	4680000	extra shy and stuff
4680000	4683000	so enjoy this shyness
4683000	4686000	while you can I guess
4686000	4689000	so you're saying you need to defrost
4689000	4692000	that's actually a good way to
4692000	4695000	put it I think so
4695000	4698000	I think I need to defrost
4698000	4701000	give me a few more streams
4701000	4704000	and you'll probably start to see
4704000	4707000	my other parts
4707000	4710000	start to show
4710000	4713000	more and more
4717000	4720000	honestly I don't really know
4720000	4723000	what else to say regarding my anime taste
4723000	4726000	all I will say is
4726000	4729000	that I will have
4729000	4732000	um
4732000	4735000	I will do watch-alongs
4735000	4738000	of some of them and also some
4738000	4741000	that aren't listening here
4741000	4744000	because I think it would be fun
4744000	4747000	but again I also want your honest opinion
4747000	4750000	like for example if we ever do a watch-along
4750000	4753000	and you find it boring
4753000	4756000	and enjoy it
4756000	4759000	I would want you to give me feedback
4759000	4762000	and let me know
4762000	4765000	and I just won't do watch-alongs anymore
4765000	4768000	or I'll do them less or something like that
4768000	4771000	because I want to have fun
4771000	4774000	but I also want you to have fun as well
4774000	4777000	I want to still hang out together and
4777000	4780000	enjoy each other's company
4781000	4784000	one stream of overcooked 2 would kill the allure
4784000	4787000	okay I agree
4787000	4790000	I have played that game before a couple of times
4790000	4793000	and oh my god that game
4793000	4796000	at the start it's kinda manageable
4796000	4799000	but it gets so difficult
4799000	4802000	that my brain just can't handle it and it becomes just complete chaos
4802000	4805000	like I don't even know what I'm doing anymore
4805000	4808000	kinda chaos
4808000	4811000	okay so
4811000	4813000	enough
4813000	4816000	enough with this
4816000	4819000	what was I gonna show
4819000	4822000	there was another slide
4822000	4825000	I'm trying to find it
4825000	4828000	sorry
4828000	4831000	where is it
4831000	4834000	I already showed this one
4834000	4837000	where is the one I'm looking for
4837000	4840000	no not this one
4840000	4843000	no not this one
4843000	4846000	no not this one
4852000	4855000	professional streamer
4855000	4858000	okay
4858000	4861000	okay
4861000	4864000	okay so
4864000	4867000	before you say anything
4867000	4870000	I know I have some
4870000	4873000	really big goals
4873000	4876000	enormous goals
4876000	4879000	to say the least but
4879000	4882000	again
4882000	4885000	I'm a believer in
4885000	4888000	the ability
4888000	4891000	for us to reach our dreams and make them
4891000	4894000	a reality even if at first they seem
4894000	4897000	really out of reach
4897000	4900000	and big
4900000	4903000	the more time goes the more
4903000	4906000	I think it's possible to reach them
4906000	4909000	and continue working towards
4909000	4912000	all of them
4912000	4915000	so my first goal
4915000	4918000	is a youtube play button
4919000	4922000	to get
4922000	4925000	and such a big milestone to reach
4925000	4928000	I think when a few years pass by
4928000	4931000	and I look back on it I would be like wow
4931000	4934000	I really did that
4934000	4937000	I actually achieved that
4937000	4940000	that's so cool
4940000	4943000	another goal that I have is the 3D DJ party
4943000	4946000	that I already actually brought up
4946000	4949000	in today's stream I already touched
4949000	4952000	based on that and explained it
4952000	4955000	I really want to have a 3D DJ party
4955000	4958000	in an IRL venue
4958000	4961000	where you guys could actually go inside an IRL venue
4961000	4964000	and see us in 3D
4964000	4967000	and dance with us and party with us
4967000	4970000	and interact with us
4970000	4973000	I think that would be such a cool concept
4973000	4976000	that's different than the usual
4976000	4979000	Vtuber concerts because that's been done
4979000	4982000	multiple times but this specific thing
4982000	4985000	hasn't been done yet and I'm really hoping that
4985000	4988000	VLR can be the first
4988000	4991000	place to make that happen
4991000	4994000	I just think it would be a really cool thing to do
4994000	4997000	original song
4997000	5000000	is another thing that I'm hoping to achieve
5000000	5003000	now I'm not a singer
5003000	5006000	by any means
5006000	5009000	I don't have those amazing singing skills
5009000	5012000	or nothing
5012000	5015000	but again it's one of those things
5015000	5018000	that I really want to
5018000	5021000	write off my bucket list
5021000	5024000	it's one of the things that I want to know
5024000	5027000	that I did at least once in my life
5027000	5030000	really cute and cool to have
5030000	5033000	my own original song made
5033000	5036000	and I don't know I think that would be exciting
5036000	5039000	and really cool
5039000	5042000	any ideas for the song
5042000	5045000	as of right now I'll be honest
5045000	5048000	I'm not so sure
5048000	5051000	but I think the more time goes
5051000	5054000	the more I'll probably
5054000	5057000	have more of an idea
5057000	5060000	right now it's more of a general goal
5060000	5063000	I don't really have the details
5063000	5066000	figured out and stuff like that yet
5066000	5069000	another goal of mine
5069000	5072000	is by parents
5072000	5075000	a house or be able
5075000	5078000	to support them enough so that
5078000	5081000	they can retire
5081000	5084000	my parents are both really the most amazing people
5084000	5087000	in the world
5087000	5090000	they've given everything for me and beyond
5090000	5093000	they always made sure
5093000	5096000	to keep me as happy as I can
5096000	5099000	always work extremely hard
5099000	5102000	always been supportive
5102000	5105000	of what I wanted to do
5105000	5108000	always loved me and accepted me
5109000	5112000	the more time goes by
5112000	5115000	the more I'm like
5115000	5118000	I just really want them to retire
5118000	5121000	I really want the rest of their lives
5121000	5124000	to be just relaxing
5124000	5127000	and having a good time
5127000	5130000	and not worry about work anymore
5130000	5133000	and get them a nice house
5133000	5136000	where they can be living life
5136000	5139000	because they genuinely deserve it
5139000	5142000	they've given me so much love
5142000	5145000	just so many things
5145000	5148000	to be honest this goal
5148000	5151000	is my number one goal
5151000	5154000	to be honest
5154000	5157000	if I can give that to them one day
5157000	5160000	I'll honestly be the most fulfilled
5160000	5163000	and happy that I can be
5163000	5166000	you know that I can give my parents a better life
5166000	5169000	and give them back
5169000	5172000	for all the insane
5172000	5175000	amount of love and attention and hard work
5175000	5178000	that they've put into me
5178000	5181000	I love them very much
5181000	5184000	they actually
5184000	5187000	know that I'm a VTuber and that I stream
5187000	5190000	and they're extremely supportive
5190000	5193000	and they're super sweet about it
5193000	5196000	actually whenever I
5196000	5199000	sometimes I would talk with them
5199000	5202000	and video chat with them
5202000	5205000	and so there was this one time when I showed them
5205000	5208000	what I look like
5208000	5211000	in my polar bear form
5211000	5214000	and they were amazed
5214000	5217000	they were like wow it looks just like you
5217000	5220000	they were so excited they got
5220000	5223000	and I also remember when I got
5223000	5226000	the email
5226000	5229000	the big email from VLR
5229000	5232000	for an interview and stuff
5232000	5235000	I told my parents when I finally got accepted
5235000	5238000	and my dad was so happy for me
5238000	5241000	that he started dancing
5241000	5244000	and he almost fell
5244000	5247000	I was so sweet and supportive
5247000	5250000	and happy for me
5250000	5253000	it was just super cute and I'm like
5253000	5256000	man I do it for that
5256000	5259000	I also want to adopt
5259000	5262000	many more cats
5262000	5265000	so they can have better life
5265000	5268000	and a forever home
5268000	5271000	I have two cats already but I do want to have more
5272000	5275000	because I really love going to the animal shelter
5275000	5278000	and check
5278000	5281000	on the new cats that I have sometimes
5281000	5283000	and
5283000	5286000	sorry
5286000	5289000	and there's just so many
5289000	5292000	cats in there that are super sweet
5292000	5295000	and nice and
5295000	5298000	I just want them to give them a good life
5298000	5301000	I want to know
5301000	5304000	that this cute cat or these cute cats
5304000	5307000	will live their best life
5307000	5310000	that they possibly can experience
5310000	5313000	so that's another thing that I really want to do
5313000	5316000	there's also a lot of
5316000	5319000	such sweet old cats that don't get adopted
5319000	5322000	I really want to adopt
5322000	5325000	some old cats as well
5325000	5328000	I feel like they really deserve a lot of love
5328000	5331000	and I really want to make sure that the time
5331000	5334000	that they do have left
5334000	5337000	will be spent being the happiest that they can be
5337000	5340000	and then another goal
5340000	5343000	is to appear at cons
5343000	5346000	or meet ups and stuff like that to meet you
5346000	5349000	it's just such a big dream of mine
5349000	5352000	I think it would be like honestly
5352000	5355000	the coolest thing ever to actually see all of you
5355000	5358000	and talk to you and say hi to you
5358000	5361000	and I don't know isn't that exciting
5361000	5364000	that would be just
5364000	5367000	like you know
5367000	5370000	the coolest thing ever
5370000	5373000	and it's just
5373000	5376000	I don't know there's just something about it
5376000	5379000	that would make me feel really happy
5379000	5382000	and excited to actually get to meet each and one of you
5382000	5385000	and it's just
5385000	5388000	it's just really cool and I hope I get
5388000	5391000	to do that
5391000	5394000	I really hope I get to do that someday
5394000	5397000	I think that would be really nice thing
5397000	5400000	to do
5400000	5403000	hold on
5403000	5406000	sorry
5406000	5409000	my eye was itchy
5409000	5412000	I had to scratch it back
5412000	5415000	okay so
5415000	5418000	this
5418000	5421000	my mom
5421000	5424000	okay now

5685180	5686900	ар, That we are土
5686900	5691560	I want to say something else that I
5691560	5694760	have a word almost salad in my mouth
5694760	5696060	and I keep talking
5696380	5696740	and
5696980	5697500	and
5702780	5703660	OK
5704220	5705580	Take a deep breath
5706540	5708400	OK, so
5708760	5721760	Now that the merch is officially open, I want you all to know that 100% of...
5721760	5726760	How do you word it? Fuck, man, I'm really bad at this, huh?
5726760	5731760	Why did they hire me?
5731760	5741760	I basically got 100% of all sales, yeah, yeah, yeah, all sales, yeah, I get 100% of sales.
5741760	5749760	So if you want to support me, this is a really, really good way to support me and my gen mates, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5749760	5754760	Amazing, right? Okay, so let me show you some of the merch.
5754760	5764760	We have a cute keychain with an acrylic, me being all EP and cute.
5764760	5767760	And look at that.
5772760	5780760	Thank God this is not my official debut, because wow, that would have been like the shittiest debut in all history.
5781760	5788760	The cute thing about the keychain is that you can basically carry me around anywhere you go.
5788760	5800760	You go, if you go anywhere, just put me on your back or as a phone charm or wherever and I'll just be there.
5800760	5808760	Just like pocket, icy snowpies, always there to give you moral support.
5808760	5810760	I don't know what I'm saying.
5810760	5823760	And then another thing that we have, excuse me, an acrylic stand.
5823760	5831760	So in those days that you don't go anywhere, if you just want to be home and stay and relax,
5831760	5839760	and let's say, you know, it's the middle of the night and you're feeling lonely and you miss me and you're like,
5839760	5843760	man, I miss icy snowpies.
5843760	5847760	I wish you was here with me, coddling me.
5847760	5850760	Well, do I have the solution for you?
5850760	5859760	You see this? Just get this acrylic stand of me and put it in your bed, put the cover and
5859760	5864760	cuddle with me and just go to town.
5864760	5867760	Do whatever you want with me, you know?
5867760	5870760	Pleasure all my...
5872760	5874760	The fuck is my problem?
5877760	5878760	What is my problem?
5878760	5883760	And we also have really cool sweatpants.
5883760	5892760	So whenever you want to wear something inside your house, but still feel cool and fashionable,
5892760	5897760	you can get these sweatpants that look really cute and really cool.
5897760	5904760	They have all of these snow prints on it.
5904760	5911760	So whenever you walk around the house and someone comes in or you just look in the mirror
5911760	5921760	and you're like, man, these snow prints, wow, they make me think of icy.
5921760	5929760	Man, I miss her, but damn, do I look cool with these sweatpants?
5929760	5937760	Oh my god, I'm so sorry that you're witnessing this.
5937760	5939760	I apologize.
5939760	5952760	And then we also have a really, really cute hoodie with this really, really nice art with me on it.
5952760	5963760	So if you are the kind of person that loves hoodies and feels comfy in them, well, look at this amazing thing.
5963760	5975760	It has this beautiful art of me and then on the sides of the arms, it has those eyes.
5975760	5979760	Not eyes, fuck, I'm stupid, the freaking snowflakes.
5979760	5983760	The freaking snowflakes, that's the word I was looking for.
5983760	5985760	Oh my god, I'm stupid.
5985760	5992760	It has snowflakes on the arms and if you get it together with the sweatpants, it will be basically like I said.
5992760	6007760	However, if a hoodie is in your thing or the weather is getting too hot for a hoodie right now, for most places anyways, you can just get a t-shirt.
6007760	6015760	Yeah, now that it's getting hotter and it's becoming somewhere, you can just wear a t-shirt as well.
6015760	6029760	So if you wanna go outside or even wear it inside the house and always have me around or show everyone how cool you are, this t-shirt is definitely for you.
6029760	6032760	Definitely recommend.
6034760	6041760	I really hope that you like all these merch stuff.
6041760	6044760	Let me post the link again.
6046760	6049760	Fuck, what is enough?
6049760	6050760	Oh, okay.
6050760	6052760	Oh no, my arm, fuck.
6052760	6056760	I need to get rid of that.
6056760	6066760	I keep bringing the other fucking cold ice cones.
6066760	6071760	I keep bringing up the freaking third arm with ice cones.
6071760	6073760	I need to get rid of that.
6073760	6077760	I keep pushing it accidentally.
6077760	6081760	I just keep pushing it accidentally like a dumbass.
6081760	6084760	Oh my god, I'm sorry about that.
6084760	6086760	Hold on.
6086760	6089760	Let me sit back.
6089760	6091760	Let me sit, fuck.
6091760	6093760	Okay, let me...
6095760	6098760	Okay, now more comfy.
6098760	6100760	Nice, nice, nice.
6100760	6105760	Is that your special merch I see?
6105760	6107760	What do you mean by special?
6107760	6116760	I mean, if there's a merch of me, I mean, all of it is special, right?
6116760	6118760	Spy Team Fortress 2?
6118760	6121760	Well, what do you mean?
6124760	6127760	How could my kusuga be so cute and pun?
6127760	6129760	I honestly don't know.
6129760	6132760	It's just the nature of me, strongy.
6132760	6135760	That's how I am at first.
6135760	6140760	And as time goes by, I become more and more ready.
6142760	6144760	You are special?
6144760	6145760	Yeah, mentally.
6145760	6147760	But thank you.
6148760	6150760	What are we talking about, chat?
6150760	6153760	We're talking about my merch.
6153760	6155760	Merch?
6155760	6157760	Yeah!
6157760	6161760	Man, that was so embarrassing.
6161760	6164760	Like, what was that?
6164760	6168760	I think I'm gonna cringe at that for the rest of my life.
6168760	6177760	I'm really trying to sell stuff to you and all I have to say is merch, yeah.
6180760	6184760	Well, we know you are, but underneath the bradians...
6184760	6186760	Wait, I'm a bit confused.
6186760	6188760	What do you mean by that?
6188760	6191760	I think you missworded what you were trying to say.
6192760	6195760	Do we get an icy cup to come pre-filled?
6197760	6199760	No.
6199760	6201760	Not yet anyways.
6201760	6202760	I think.
6202760	6204760	I mean, we'll see what happens, maybe.
6204760	6206760	Maybe in the future.
6207760	6209760	You already sold it to me easy.
6209760	6210760	Wow, really?
6210760	6213760	Wow, I'm honestly impressed.
6214760	6217760	That just that alone would be enough.
6218760	6220760	It's our thing now.
6220760	6221760	Merch, yes?
6221760	6222760	Get your sentence?
6222760	6223760	Oh, no.
6223760	6237760	Out of all, like, cool sentences that I could have, like, come up with, or, like, a motto or something, like, that's the best that I have, like, really?
6238760	6246760	I think they meant underneath your guffinius, your brad.
6246760	6248760	Yeah, well, it is.
6248760	6255760	I would say that I can be, like, a bit of a sweet brat.
6255760	6257760	I don't know if that makes any sense.
6257760	6263760	Like, I enjoy being a brat because obviously it's really funny and entertaining for me,
6263760	6268760	but I have my sweet moments as well, you know?
6270760	6272760	Don't undersell yourself.
6272760	6282760	Yeah, I'm trying my best to work on becoming more confident and stuff like that, and that's second guessing myself as much.
6286760	6292760	Honestly, I would 100% buy a shirt that just says Merch, yeah?
6292760	6294760	Wow, new Merch idea.
6294760	6296760	Oh my God, Stroney, look at that.
6296760	6299760	Here you go, here's the new Merch idea.
6299760	6307760	Get a t-shirt and have it say Merch, yeah, and a picture of me.
6308760	6312760	Oh my God, that would be so goofy.
6313760	6325760	You're Merch missing a hat and shoes, if there are, it'll be full armor.
6325760	6328760	Who knows, maybe eventually that would be a thing.
6328760	6331760	I'm not really sure.
6331760	6335760	Oh my God, I keep having to clear my throat so much, I'm so sorry.
6335760	6341760	But yeah, if you notice me muting a lot, it's because I keep having to clear my throat.
6341760	6348760	I don't think, I don't know the last time I have talked so much, honestly.
6348760	6356760	I've been yapping for almost two hours non-stop, so I guess that would make sense.
6356760	6362760	I just constantly have to clear my throat, I didn't speak that much for such a long time.
6362760	6365760	Clearing your throat, she just liked me.
6365760	6368760	It's honestly really annoying, it's so annoying.
6368760	6374760	I just want to be able to talk and talk non-stop and not have it cut in my way.
6374760	6377760	At least you're comfortable streaming.
6377760	6384760	Yeah, the more streams I have, the more comfortable I'm with.
6385760	6389760	Don't mute yourself, we need every cough.
6389760	6393760	We just want to hear your sneezes because of that.
6393760	6396760	I don't know about that.
6396760	6400760	I don't know if you want to hear it.
6400760	6404760	I don't know about that.
6404760	6407760	I don't know if you want to hear it.
6407760	6410760	I don't know.
6411760	6416760	I don't know if you want to hear me clear my throat.
6416760	6419760	I don't know, that's a very pleasant sound.
6422760	6426760	Fastest yapper in the west.
6429760	6434760	That sniffing video was, well, not video short.
6434760	6435760	It's pretty cute.
6435760	6442760	Actually, I don't know if I'm allowed to say it, but I hope it's okay.
6442760	6445760	I don't think it's a bad thing.
6445760	6456760	There's actually going to be a short meme ASMR video coming up of me sniffing.
6456760	6470760	I actually noticed that after my short, a lot of people said that they really like when I do the sniffing in ASMR.
6470760	6478760	So yeah, if you really like sniffing in ASMR, a short video is going to come up.
6478760	6480760	Oh my god, no graduate right now.
6480760	6482760	I see you on that sandwich.
6482760	6484760	Okay, okay, I wasn't sure.
6484760	6489760	I wasn't sure how much I'm allowed to say or not.
6489760	6498760	But yeah, if you're into ASMR sniffing out, there will be a short ASMR video coming up with that.
6498760	6500760	I don't like sniffing ASMR.
6500760	6503760	I think it could be pretty nice.
6503760	6513760	But it's a bit tricky to do because whenever I do it, I'm not sure if I'm doing it too loud or if it sounds good or not.
6513760	6525760	So I guess you can give me feedback on that when that video is going to be up.
6525760	6527760	But will you be sniffing though?
6527760	6529760	You of course!
6529760	6531760	Yeah!
6531760	6533760	Obviously I'm going to be sniffing you.
6533760	6535760	Who cares about anything else?
6535760	6542760	I want to sniff you and know your nice scent.
6542760	6544760	Video goes up later today.
6544760	6547760	Oh, nice! I had no idea. That's awesome.
6547760	6549760	Okay, that's good to know.
6549760	6553760	So see, the sniffing ASMR is actually going to be up later today.
6553760	6556760	So yeah, thank you for letting me know, Strani.
6556760	6558760	That's awesome.
6558760	6560760	Oh, do you sound sniffing?
6560760	6564760	Yeah, trying to make sure I remember that scent very well.
6564760	6566760	Oh, do you sound sniffing?
6567760	6572760	Wait, wait, let me shower first.
6572760	6578760	Okay, well, time is ticking, so you better get in that shower.
6584760	6591760	The thing was by TF2 is there's a glitch in the mission where he has three arms, so kind of reference.
6592760	6599760	I used to play a lot of TF2 in the past.
6599760	6602760	And I used to main the heavy.
6602760	6609760	I don't know if you know why, but his Russian accent.
6609760	6617760	And because I speak Russian, I thought it would be funny to main him.
6617760	6622760	Besides that, I also really love his weapon.
6622760	6629760	I really love the ability to be extra strong in games.
6629760	6633760	And I love how fast his weapon goes.
6633760	6639760	Because it just goes just shooting non-stop.
6639760	6644760	So yeah, I used to main the heavy and it's always been really fun.
6644760	6652760	Sometimes I would also play as engineer, I think.
6652760	6658760	Sometimes I would also play as engineer, but yeah, heavy was my main.
6658760	6665760	Heavy was my main, and I just have such good memories playing TF2.
6666760	6678760	I wonder if it would be possible to ever play TF2 with you?
6678760	6683760	I would have to figure that out. How would that work if it was possible?
6683760	6688760	Because it wouldn't be cool if we played it together or something.
6688760	6694760	I mean, I'm gonna suck. I haven't played it in a few years.
6694760	6698760	It's been such a long time, but I think that would be really cool.
6698760	6707760	So if it was possible and I could figure out a way to make it work, I think that would be cool.
6707760	6723760	But regardless of that, I really want to find games that, you know, games where a lot of people can play together, if that makes sense.
6723760	6728760	I think that would be really fun as well.
6728760	6749760	I know there's like the usual fall guys and stuff, but if you have any recommendations for multiplayer games that allow quite a bit of people in it, I think that would be really cool if we can do that.
6749760	6757760	I think that would be fun to meet you in-game and play and do fun stuff.
6757760	6760760	I think that would be really nice.
6760760	6763760	Nice quality time together in a way.
6763760	6775760	I know technically this is our quality time because I'm talking to you right now, but I meant quality time where we actually do stuff together, if that makes sense.
6776760	6779760	Monster Hunter?
6779760	6783760	I'm really bad at Monster Hunter.
6783760	6785760	Like really bad.
6785760	6787760	Like so bad that...
6789760	6791760	Man, I'm really bad at games.
6791760	6795760	Like I feel in group games and stuff like that.
6795760	6799760	I'm probably just going to hold back.
6799760	6801760	Hold everyone down?
6801760	6803760	Is that how you say it?
6803760	6807760	I can't forget, there's a way to say it.
6807760	6812760	Like hold everyone back or hold everyone down.
6812760	6815760	Just because of how bad I am in games, but...
6815760	6817760	Oh well.
6818760	6820760	Minecraft?
6821760	6823760	Okay, so...
6823760	6826760	Okay, Minecraft, so...
6827760	6829760	Ah...
6832760	6834760	How do I...
6836760	6838760	How do I explain it?
6838760	6846760	Okay, so Minecraft for me, I will say right now, I don't care about the building part of it.
6846760	6848760	I just don't care about the building.
6848760	6854760	If I do build something, it's going to look like a freaking box.
6854760	6856760	And it's going to look messy.
6856760	6858760	It's going to look like trash.
6858760	6862760	I'm the kind of person that if I will play Minecraft,
6862760	6865760	I will be the person that causes trouble.
6865760	6869760	I will start throwing explosives everywhere.
6869760	6873760	I will start punching everyone and run away.
6873760	6878760	I will want to go exploring and kill monsters.
6878760	6882760	And collect like cool shiny stuff or like heal.
6883760	6889760	You know, things are hard to kill, but like team up and stuff like that.
6890760	6896760	But yeah, like the building aspect of Minecraft is just...
6896760	6899760	Not for me, I just...
6899760	6902760	I just don't care about that part of the game.
6902760	6904760	I just don't.
6904760	6911760	I want to like do funny and cool stuff.
6913760	6918760	Breddy bear blows up a Jason's house with TNT traps.
6918760	6921760	Yeah, that is something I would definitely do.
6921760	6923760	Do you like Terraria?
6923760	6926760	I've played it a bit here and there.
6926760	6932760	It was a nice game, but I could never like really fully get into it.
6932760	6937760	Not that I'm like into Minecraft either.
6938760	6945760	Like for me, I would only play it with my gen mates, you know?
6945760	6951760	Like when we get like a server and we can play together,
6951760	6954760	then I would love to play it with them, you know?
6954760	6957760	But I'm not into like playing it on my own
6957760	6961760	because that would just be like really boring for me personally.
6968760	6973760	Sorry, my brain is getting fried.
6973760	6976760	Hold on, I also want to check something.
6976760	6978760	I want to check something.
6978760	6989760	I know that Strani is supposed to stream pretty soon, I think, right?
6989760	6992760	If I'm correct, let me check.
6998760	7003760	Oh yeah, she's going to stream in like six minutes.
7003760	7005760	She's going to stream in like six minutes.
7005760	7010760	So I wonder if it would be a good idea if I end the stream here
7010760	7013760	and I redirect you guys to her stream
7013760	7016760	because honestly, I want to be in that stream
7016760	7020760	and be in her chat and listen to her
7020760	7022760	because she's going to have a really fun stream today.
7022760	7026760	She's going to be exposing via lore.
7026760	7028760	She's going to be exposing via lore.
7028760	7030760	Talk about behind the scenes and all that stuff.
7030760	7033760	So it's going to be super, super fun.
7033760	7039760	So I think what I should do right now is I'm going to end the stream.
7039760	7042760	Please, please don't leave, please don't leave.
7042760	7047760	Once I end the stream, you will automatically be redirected into Strani's stream
7047760	7051760	and she'll be talking about all behind the scenes,
7051760	7054760	all the juicy stuff.
7054760	7057760	And yeah, I think you will really, really enjoy it.
7057760	7060760	I know I will and I am in VLR.
7060760	7064760	So we can both hang out in her chat.
7064760	7069760	So for I leave, I wanted to say thank you, thank you, thank you so much
7069760	7071760	for showing up to my stream today.
7071760	7076760	Thank you for hearing me up for two hours.
7076760	7078760	I had a lot of fun with you.
7078760	7080760	Thank you for being so sweet to me.
7080760	7083760	Thank you for all the kind words
7083760	7085760	and support.
7085760	7090760	And I will see you again tomorrow at the same time.
7090760	7093760	I will be playing Tomb Raider Legends,
7093760	7096760	which is one of my favorite Tomb Raider games.
7101760	7103760	I will see you tomorrow.
7103760	7105760	I'm going to miss you.
7105760	7106760	Don't miss me too much.
7106760	7108760	You'll see me again soon.
7108760	7110760	And let's go.
7110760	7111760	Let's go to Strani.
7111760	7113760	Let's go watch her stream.
7113760	7115760	Bye bye for now.
7115760	7118760	Bye bye.
