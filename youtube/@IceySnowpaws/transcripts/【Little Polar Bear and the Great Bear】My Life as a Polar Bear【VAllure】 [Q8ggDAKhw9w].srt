um num num num num num num today we are going to be playing the polar bear game it's a it's a pretty old game it took me a while to set it up and stuff but that's how it is with retro games sadly I love them so much but a lot of them are a big pain to

13
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:21,000
just to set up also why the hell does my model keep pausing what the hell do I need to like do something I wonder if I need to have my iPhone plugged in the whole time or something what the fuck I missed me

14
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:45,000
that's really sweet I I think it's really sweet to hear that I have been missed you know cuz like it how do I explain it like when someone tells me that they miss me it's like this nice feeling of like oh so so it means that my absence

15
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:59,000
uh means something you know cuz like when like you're gone and nobody misses you that it makes you feel like well what's the point of streaming right nobody misses me anyway so

16
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:19,000
uh why stream but but because you do miss me uh it makes me go like oh they they actually do miss me and and they think of me so like that gives me like a big reason to uh to stream you know like if

17
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:38,000
you weren't here I wouldn't have a reason to stream to be honest and it wouldn't be fun you know so uh yeah that's what we're gonna do today I am gonna try to open the game um and when I open the game you know

18
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:48,000
same thing we do every gaming stream let me know how the sound of the game is let me know if uh if you can see everything or if there's anything to change and stuff like that

19
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I say I can't wait for your smm stream honestly honestly me too I'm really excited for that as well I'm excited for for tomorrow stream did you miss us though of course I did that's why that's why I was yapping on on my alt twitter yesterday so imagine

20
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I responded to a lot of Maros because I missed you guys if I didn't miss you I would be like man fuck this no bear don't give a fuck I'm I don't want to I don't want to talk

21
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't give a fuck

22
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:39,000
but yeah yeah I definitely miss you and I'm so happy to be back here but yeah I'm really excited for tomorrow stream but I am really nervous because I'm really scared that the background noise on everything that the microphone picks up is gonna like

23
00:10:40,000 --> 00:11:05,000
make make my smr stream like not as good as the rest of the girls but I I I hope that it's not gonna but it's not going to bother you too too much and and you know and I don't know that the best that I can provide you with at the moment will be good enough for now anyways

24
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'll I promise I'll do my very best to make it a good smr stream um another thing I don't know if that is smr stream if the vod is gonna stay up or not because as you've noticed some of my gen mates who did smr they had their vods like bonked by youtube so yeah

25
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:53,000
if you want to archive tomorrow's smr stream by all means go go ahead and do that because again you you can't know with youtube at the moment what's gonna happen so um yeah if you want to be like extra careful or something like that

26
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:11,000
um be be sure to archive it and I'll I'll post a link but hopefully hopefully hopefully it doesn't hopefully it doesn't get taken down but if it does well oh well what can you do

27
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:34,000
oh my god be gentle it's okay oh I well don't worry when um when I do smr I get extremely uh extremely gentle to be honest and whisper and oh lovey dovey and cutesy and yeah

28
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:43,000
um I'm gonna make sure to do my best to keep you as comfy as I can tomorrow so you're in good hands with me don't worry about that

29
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'll I'll do my best I'll do my best for my OG sons

30
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:02,000

33
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:37,000
blah blah blah okay I'm I don't know why I'm nervous to open the game but I am for some reason

34
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:47,000
because because because if I open the game and there's something I need to fix it's gonna be it's gonna be a mess to fix it's gonna be a mess to fix

35
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
because like the game just like completely shits itself if you like I'll tap out of it

36
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:15,000
what's the art for the smr stream finished um in time for though um it's it's it's not finished yet no it's not finished yet but uh it says that it roughly takes eight days

37
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
uh for the art to be done so it will be ready in a few days so so you will see the art soon very soon

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Good Lord, keep it up.

154
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You're doing great.

155
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I feel better already.

156
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I think you're nearly there.

157
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I don't know, I feel like I'm making everything worse.

158
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm so bad at this game.

159
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm supposed to be for children.

160
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Why am I so stupid?

161
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Please Igor, you're making it difficult.

162
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Every time he says those things, it makes my brain hurt.

163
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
No.

164
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm making it worse.

165
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
What's that? This is a good idea.

166
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
What's that?

167
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
All right.

168
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Now I move this thing.

169
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Good Lord, keep it up.

170
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Come on.

171
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
No.

172
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Hi.

173
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Doing the bear doesn't do anything.

174
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Clicking the bear doesn't do anything.

175
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Fuck.

176
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Why did you do the puzzle game though?

177
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Because I thought I'm smart.

178
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Because it's a children's game.

179
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
But I'm fucking stupid.

180
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Pull it from the other side.

181
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Okay, but what's the other side?

182
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
There's two sides left, right, up and down.

183
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I don't know what other side means.

184
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You have to tell me specifically what side and what number of the row.

185
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You are too smart for the game.

186
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
No, I'm not.

187
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I'm stupid.

188
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I have to save Igor.

189
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I have to save Igor, but I'm too smart.

190
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Good Lord, keep it up.

191
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm too stupid.

192
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Pull from the front.

193
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Okay, that's not smart.

194
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Come on.

195
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Come on.

196
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Come on.

197
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Left four.

198
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
That's as much as far as it goes.

199
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Pull four.

200
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Try the fourth arrow on the left.

201
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Well, that's how it does.

202
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I have to save Igor.

203
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I'm really stupid.

204
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I feel better already.

205
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Igor, shut up, please.

206
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Oh my fucking God.

207
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm so embarrassed, honestly.

208
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I was like, I can do this.

209
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
This is a children's game.

210
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
But I'm too fucking stupid, apparently, for that.

211
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Oh, great.

212
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I feel better already.

213
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm gonna die, please.

214
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I feel so bad.

215
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's over for me.

216
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It's so over for me.

217
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I feel better already.

218
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Stop moaning.

219
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Stop moaning, Igor, please.

220
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I feel better already.

221
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Please, stop being...

222
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Please, I'm trying to think and you're not helping me.

223
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Come on, not like this.

224
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Why can't I not move this one?

225
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Come on.

226
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
This is the first fucking thing.

227
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I feel better already.

228
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Guys, I need...

229
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Whatever.

230
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Oh my God.

231
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Hello?

232
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Hello? Why can't I click anything?

233
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
What is this?

234
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Whenever you want to come back and play with me,

235
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
all you have to do is to become a friend that you chose at the beginning.

236
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
See you soon.

237
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
No, not like this.

238
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
No!

239
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
What the fuck?

240
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Oh my fucking God.

241
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Please.

242
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Okay, I'm sorry.

243
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
But I'm not dealing with Shibi's ropes, okay?

244
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm too stupid to untie Shibi's ropes, okay?

245
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Igor is going to be okay.

246
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Shibi's gonna come back, she's gonna untie Igor

247
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
and he's gonna be fine.

248
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I think I'm smart enough to deal with Shibi's ropes.

249
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I'm sorry, she's gonna have to deal with that herself.

250
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Are you sure of your choice?

251
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
We're gonna go somewhere.

252
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
It will allow you to come back to your game where you left off.

253
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Okay, okay.

254
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

255
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Damn, I should have just went with the story mode

256
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
and pretend that I'm doing it.

257
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
You can play with Lars and help him along on his adventure in the game.

258
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Or you can follow his adventure like a story mode.

259
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Lars, please.

260
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Please, let me do something.

261
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Please, I'm too stupid for this.

262
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
No, no.

263
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Wait, what?

264
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Wait, what? No!

265
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
No, there's a minute for me to have to do this again!

266
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Before we go and see Igor, we'll have to catch some food.

267
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Help me catch the fish.

268
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
When a fish jumps out of the water,

269
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
please tell me I don't have to do this shit again.

270
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
No, please.

271
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Please, no.

272
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Please, no.

273
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Please, let me go somewhere else.

274
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Please, I'm begging.

275
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And please.

276
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Please, I'm begging.

277
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Please.

278
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Please, let me have fun.

279
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Oh my fucking god.

280
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Whenever you want to come back and play with me,

281
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
all you have to do is click on the friend that you chose at the beginning.

282
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
See you soon.

283
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
This is the worst fucking stream ever.

284
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
What the fuck am I doing?

285
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Please.

286
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Why am I stupid?

287
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Oh my god.

288
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm stupid, okay?

289
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm sorry I have no brain cells left.

290
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Hello?

291
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I know who you are, shut up.

292
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Choose one of my friends.

293
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
He will be your playmate and remember our adventure.

294
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Oh my god, okay.

295
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Be sure of your choice.

296
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Don't forget which animal you chose.

297
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It will allow you to come back to your game where you left off.

298
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Please.

299
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm low-key tempted to do fucking stories.

300
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Because I'm too fucking stupid.

301
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And help him along on his adventure in the game.

302
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Or you can follow his adventure like a storybook.

303
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Okay, I need your opinion.

304
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
What do you Snowberries think I should do?

305
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You can play with Lars and help him along on his adventure in the game.

306
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Should I keep trying to get rid of those fucking ropes?

307
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Or should I just give up and do fucking story mode?

308
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Oh my god.

309
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
The animals are just save slots.

310
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Okay, that makes sense.

311
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm fucking stupid.

312
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Just try again, you can do it.

313
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Okay, I have one more chance to do the rope.

314
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Story mode. You have to get good.

315
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I'll never get good.

316
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You can play with Lars and help him along on his adventure in the game.

317
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I'll give him my room and go.

318
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Okay.

319
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
If you need any help during the game, just click on Lars and he'll give you some help.

320
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
No, he won't.

321
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Why is he lying?

322
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Why is he lying?

323
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,000
He's like, oh, if you need some help, click Lars and he will help you.

324
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
No, he didn't.

325
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
He didn't fucking help me.

326
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I was clicking him like not fucking stop.

327
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I was clicking Lars not stop for help.

328
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And he didn't give me any help.

329
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
What the fuck?

330
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
The narrowed.

331
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Oh fuck.

332
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Okay, at least I can fish.

333
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
At least I have that going for me in this life.

334
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Lars is like fucking stupid.

335
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
He's the oldest one in the north.

336
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
He has an amazing memory.

337
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Lars, you're good.

338
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Oh god, I'm gonna have to listen to Igor Mon again, please.

339
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Hi, Igor. What happened to you?

340
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Lars, I'm stuck in this fishing net.

341
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Please help me get out by pulling on the ropes to put them in the right order.

342
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
We'll have to use all our strength to pull these ropes.

343
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Oh god, here we go.

344
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Keep Lars, keep it up.

345
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Oh god.

346
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Oh god, oh this is gonna be so fucking bad.

347
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

348
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Please.

349
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Oh, I feel better already.

350
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I don't, I feel like shit.

351
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:24,000
You know, when I planned going back to the wild for a visit with OG suns,

352
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,000
this is not what I had in mind.

353
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Please stop moaning.

354
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You're making it very difficult for me to rescue you, okay Igor?

355
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to shut up.

356
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I see which rope affects...

357
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I can't even fucking talk because he starts moaning.

358
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Which rope affects the fourth one?

359
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
This one? This one on this?

360
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Please.

361
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
No.

362
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I love how I click Lars.

363
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And he's just not fucking helping in any fucking way.

364
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Igor is a freak.

365
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:38,000
The second one on the top, bottom, and the second one.

366
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Good Lars, keep it up.

367
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Please, Igor, I, I...

368
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
How did you get yourself in this mess?

369
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Like, what are you doing?

370
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Please, help.

371
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Man.

372
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
You sure this is a children's game, you know?

373
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I thought so, but I guess I'm too fucking stupid for a children's game.

374
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,000
This stupid rope.

375
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Why can't I just bring my fucking scissors?

376
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Maybe you're too smart, I think like a child.

377
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I feel better already.

378
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Please, Igor, stop.

379
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Good Lars, keep it up.

380
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Please.

381
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Marisa, you got the ropes for me.

382
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Shut up, Igor, please.

383
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Oh my fucking God, please.

384
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Good Lars, keep it up.

385
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Good Lars, keep it up.

386
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Okay.

387
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Okay.

388
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Oh.

389
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Please, please don't do anything like that.

390
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Mmm.

391
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Now what?

392
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
This stupid fucking rope, fucking die.

393
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Please.

394
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Good Lars, keep it up.

395
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Come on, please.

396
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Please, this should be good enough.

397
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Please, you literally don't have any ropes around you anymore.

398
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Please, you can literally escape this.

399
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
What do you mean?

400
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You're not even attached to him anymore.

401
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Please, Igor, please.

402
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Oh, you can escape.

403
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I'm begging.

404
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Oh my fucking...

405
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Oh my God, why is life so difficult?

406
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
God damn it!

407
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Ah!

408
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I feel better already.

409
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Well, if you feel better, just freaking get out.

410
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Oh my God.

411
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Why?

412
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Why, why?

413
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Why, why, why?

414
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Why?

415
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Why should we make this difficult?

416
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Why she has to make ropes all over this way?

417
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Why do we need to get all rope of his PNG?

418
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I guess so, cause like, he can't escape.

419
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Come on.

420
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I can't believe he's not helping me.

421
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Very nice.

422
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Why does she need to be above now?

423
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I don't know, do they?

424
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Why don't they start moving like the one on the left, though?

425
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You see, like this?

426
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Starts moving it like this.

427
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I feel better already.

428
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I can't with the mones.

429
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
See, it's like, it's making it worse.

430
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It's making it worse.

431
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So much worse.

432
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I have an idea.

433
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Let's see.

434
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Wow.

435
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Fuck off.

436
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'll be honest, a part of me is very tempted right now to go to a fucking YouTube video

437
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
and just see how they fucking solve this shit.

438
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Cause I'm fucking stupid.

439
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
We're just making an update and making the ropes go away.

440
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Don't I need to get the ropes away from him?

441
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Why do people put the ropes away?

442
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Cause he's a freak.

443
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Igor is a freak.

444
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You can touch the bear for help, though?

445
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
No, it doesn't do anything.

446
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Keep clicking on him and it doesn't do anything.

447
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
They said make the right pattern at the start.

448
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
What is the right pattern, though?

449
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
What does that even mean?

450
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
What does the right pattern mean?

451
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Fuck this one, honestly, fuck this whale.

452
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The net.

453
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
But we're trying to get him out, though.

454
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
So, like, what the fuck?

455
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Good logs, keep it up.

456
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Like, doesn't make sense.

457
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
How is we trying to get him out?

458
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Why the fuck are we trying to...?

459
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Good logs, keep it up.

460
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
This is a game called Google it.

461
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,000
The name of the game is in the title.

462
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I just looked up video and you're doing this wrong.

463
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Just try. You have nothing to lose in this one.

464
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
That's not true. I'm losing.

465
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I am losing everything right now.

466
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I am losing my dignity by playing this fucking game.

467
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Showing everyone how fucking stupid I am.

468
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So, yeah, that's just great.

469
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Like this?

470
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Okay.

471
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Isn't this the right pattern? Like, what does it mean?

472
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
This looks like the right pattern to me.

473
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Right?

474
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Time making the square-net pattern.

475
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I know. What the fuck?

476
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
You have to make a tic-tac-toe pattern with the ropes.

477
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
You need to use all ropes?

478
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Okay.

479
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Oh my god, shut up. Please, please.

480
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
You're making this? You're making this so fucking difficult, Lars.

481
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Please, I'm begging.

482
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Oh my god.

483
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Please.

484
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
How do I feel better?

485
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Literally how?

486
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
What are you doing?

487
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Okay.

488
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Lars, keep it up.

489
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
What is this?

490
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Hello.

491
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Bro, I think...

492
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
What the fuck?

493
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Oh my god. Why are you like this?

494
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Bro.

495
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I'm literally like, dying right now. What the fuck is going on?

496
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
You know, I thought this is going to be as simple.

497
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Can you see the puzzle?

498
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,000
But I was really fucking wrong, apparently.

499
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Bro, where is...

500
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Where are the other ropes?

501
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Like, hello?

502
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Oh my...

503
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
It's so hard to believe.

504
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Oh my god.

505
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
You might actually have to restart.

506
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Fuck, not again.

507
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Oh, I feel better already.

508
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Please.

509
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Oh my god.

510
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
They're off the screen.

511
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Okay, we're...

512
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Whenever you want to come back and play with me.

513
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Literally the worst remember.

514
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
What the fuck is this shit?

515
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Fuck my life.

516
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
What the fuck is this?

517
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Okay, I see no.

518
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I'm fucking dying.

519
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I'm literally dying right now from embarrassment.

520
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
From how stupid I am.

521
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
From how difficult this fucking game is.

522
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
What the fuck?

523
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
What the fuck?

524
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Do you need a hug?

525
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I need you.

526
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I don't need a hug.

527
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I need you to finish this fucking game for me.

528
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
That's what I need.

529
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I'm so sorry, Oji-san.

530
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I'm not the smartest tool in the shit.

531
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Oh my god.

532
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I'm really sorry Snow Bear is for this shitty stream.

534
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I apologize.

535
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I did not think this puzzle was going to be hard.

536
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
But I was fucking wrong apparently.

537
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Before we go and see Ego, we'll have to catch some food.

538
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I'm going to have PTSD from this game.

539
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
When a fish jumps out of the water,

540
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
catch it as fast as you can.

541
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Use your mouth to move my paw

542
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
and click on the fish as they jump out of the water.

543
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I can fish just fine.

544
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
That's not the problem here, okay?

545
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I know what to do.

546
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I can fish just fine.

547
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Easy.

548
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Easy.

549
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Easy.

550
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Great.

551
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
We have enough supplies.

552
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Let's go and see Ego.

553
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
We're in mode mode?

554
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
No, it's not.

555
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I'm playing and I'm playing.

556
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Oh god.

557
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Okay.

558
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Here we go again.

559
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
What happened to you?

560
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Lars, I'm stuck in this fishing net.

561
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Please help me get out by pulling on the ropes

562
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
to put them in the right order.

563
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
We'll have to use all our strength to pull these ropes.

564
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
When it comes to games that require brain,

565
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I don't think...

566
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I feel better already.

567
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Please stop Egor, please.

568
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I'm begging you.

569
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Please.

570
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I'm begging you.

571
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Um...

572
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I feel better already.

573
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Okay.

574
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Come on.

575
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I feel better already.

576
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Okay, Egor, here you go.

577
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000

693
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:38,880
Yes, leave me alone, please.

694
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,880
Scram.

695
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,880
He didn't even touch me.

696
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,880
Watch out for the wolves.

697
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,880
That was bullshit.

698
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,880
That was bullshit.

699
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,880
He didn't even touch me.

700
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,880
What the fuck?

701
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,880
Come on.

702
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

703
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,880
Every fucking time.

704
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,880
Fuck off.

705
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,880
Shut up, bitch.

706
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,880
Leave me alone.

707
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,880
Leave me alone.

708
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,880
God, it's me.

709
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,880
Scram.

710
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:14,880
Guide me to the exit.

711
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,880
And watch out for the wolves.

712
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,880
Why is this getting so difficult?

713
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,880
Scram.

714
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,880
It's the ground.

715
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,880
I hate this.

716
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,880
I hate this.

717
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:29,880
Why do I keep getting stuck in the air?

718
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,880
God, fucking dammit.

719
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,880
Hello?

720
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:38,880
Hello?

721
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:39,880
Fuck off.

722
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,880
Fuck off.

723
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,880
Scram.

724
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,880
I'm so fucking mad.

725
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,880
Fuck you.

726
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,880
To fuck off.

727
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,880
You know what to fuck off.

728
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:50,880
Fuck you.

729
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:51,880
Scram.

730
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:52,880
Guide me to the exit.

731
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,880
And watch out for the wolves.

732
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:55,880
I'm so sick of it.

733
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,880
What the fuck?

734
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,880
Scram.

735
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,880
Please.

736
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:05,880
Please.

737
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,880
Please, I just, I just wanted to have fun.

738
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,880
No, I'm suffering.

739
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,880
Oh, God, I don't know where the fuck to go.

740
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,880
They always get me.

741
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,880
Please, please let me have this.

742
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,880
Please let me have this.

743
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

744
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:25,880
Hey.

745
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,880
Thanks to you, I have arrived safe and sound.

746
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,880
And sound in elk territory.

747
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:30,880
Fuck you wolves.

748
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:31,880
Let's hurry up and find him.

749
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:32,880
Fuck you, bitch.

750
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,880
I haven't seen him in such a long time.

751
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,880
I'm not sure I'll recognize him.

752
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:37,880
Thanks to you, I have arrived safe and sound.

753
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:38,880
Oh, my God.

754
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:39,880
Fucking fine.

755
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,880
I'm thinking.

756
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,880
Oh, that's a lot of horses.

757
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,880
There are a lot of elks.

758
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,880
And I don't see Ed anywhere.

759
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:52,880
Oh, I thought it's some wolves.

760
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,880
Could you please help me find him?

761
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,880
I'll help you by killing you what I remember about him.

762
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,880
It's up to you to eliminate the elk that don't match Ed's description.

763
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,880
Ed's hair is very short.

764
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,880
Um.

765
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,880
Ed's antlers are not heart shaped.

766
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,880
What do you want?

767
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:20,880
I mean, I just said what do you want from me?

768
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,880
Ed sees with both his eyes.

769
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:24,880
Oh, no.

770
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,880
Ed doesn't have a patch on his eye.

771
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:32,880
If I remember correctly, he has two antlers.

772
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,880
Don't they both have two antlers?

773
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,880
It's antlers are very short.

774
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,880
Okay.

775
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,880
Ed doesn't have a beard.

776
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,880
Okay.

777
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:48,880
Yes.

778
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,880
Ed is well shaven.

779
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,880
Ed has a tail.

780
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,880
Okay.

781
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,880
Does it tell you to click the one that don't have the description?

782
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:02,880
Hello, lords.

783
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,880
Oh, it's been a very long time since we last saw each other.

784
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,880
It's so nice of you to come and see me.

785
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,880
Yeah, it's been nine years.

786
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,880
What's happened to you, Ed?

787
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,880
There was a storm.

788
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,880
Sometimes the wind blows so hard.

789
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,880
It blows my antlers away.

790
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:22,880
What?

791
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:23,880
Help me put the knife together.

792
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,880
Are I doing what I can?

793
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,880
To move a piece of Ed's antler, click on it.

794
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,880
When there is an empty box nearby,

795
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:37,880
the piece will place itself there automatically.

796
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,880
Um...

797
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,880
Oh, no!

798
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,880
That's my bus!

799
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,880
You can't mess.

800
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,880
Oh, my fucking god.

801
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,880
Oh, my god.

802
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,880
Please.

803
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,880
Why did I think this game was good?

804
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,880
Fuck.

805
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,880
Oh, my god.

806
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,880
Oh, no.

807
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,880
Oh, my god.

808
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,880
Oh, no.

809
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,880
Oh, what am I doing?

810
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:26,880
What the fuck is my problem?

811
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,880
I know what's my problem.

812
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,880
I'm fucking stupid.

813
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,880
Oh, my god.

814
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,880
Ah!

815
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,880
I'm so sorry.

816
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:45,880
Yeah, I would not survive this game without embarrassing myself.

817
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:49,880
Well, good thing I'm playing it so you don't have to embarrass yourself.

818
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,880
I can do that for you.

819
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,880
Live on streaming.

820
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,880
Please.

821
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,880
Please, I'm begging.

822
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:05,880
Oh, my god.

823
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,880
It's so over.

824
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,880
It's so over.

825
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,880
What the fuck?

826
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,880
Hello?

827
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,880
Okay.

828
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,880
I mean, this looks...

829
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,880
I mean, this looks right to me.

830
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:41,880
So, what's the fucking problem?

831
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,880
Oh, no.

832
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,880
I mean, this looks so right.

833
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,880
It looks flip.

834
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,880
How do I flip?

835
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,880
I need flippers and check.

836
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,880
Oh, my god.

837
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,880
Why am I doing this to myself?

838
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,880
Why did I go?

839
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,880
Oh, yeah, this is a good game.

840
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,880
Yeah.

841
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,880
This is exactly what we need.

842
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:40,880
Oh, fuck.

843
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,880
Oh, my god.

844
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,880
I feel much better.

845
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,880
Yeah, I'm glad you feel better.

846
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,880
I clearly don't.

847
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,880
I'm glad you all feel better, but I do not feel that great.

848
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:58,880
So, you're welcome for the sacrifice of my own emotions.

849
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,880
You're welcome.

850
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,880
I mean, okay, let's be fair.

851
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,880
Let's be fair.

852
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:15,880
It's to be expected that I'm this dumb, you know?

853
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:19,880
I am literally a feral polar bear, okay?

854
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:22,880
I haven't been in civilization long enough.

855
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,880
Just so fucking puzzle today.

856
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,880
I hope you'll see each other again soon.

857
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,880
I hope so too, Lars. Take care.

858
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,880
Would you rather cross the Arctic Ocean on Igor's back

859
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,880
or slide down the mountain?

860
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,880
Ooh.

861
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,880
What should we do?

862
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,880
What should we choose?

863
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,880
They both sound fun.

864
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,880
They both sound fun.

865
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,880
Yeah, what should we do?

866
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:57,880
Slide down the mountain?

867
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,880
Slide down the mountain?

868
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,880
Or ride on Igor's back?

869
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,880
Slide, slide.

870
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,880
No more Igor, please.

871
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,880
Okay, okay, okay.

872
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:07,880
Let's slide this now.

873
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,880

878
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,880
We're at the top of the mountain.

879
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,880
I didn't think we'd ever make it.

880
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,880
I mean, honestly, me too.

881
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,880

882
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,880
Quick, let's get down the mountain.

883
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,880
Guide my movements and avoid the obstacles.

884
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,880
Otherwise, the avalanche will catch us.

885
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,880
Okay, let's go.

886
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,880

994
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:13,200
okay let's look at the stars I'll tell you the legend of the great bear just as my father told me

995
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,240
okay but why do they call it that

996
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:24,880
as I promised I'm going to tell you another legend about the great bear

997
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:32,800
once upon a time longer ago than any walrus can remember humans lived in peace with all the

998
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:39,760
animals in the world the wisest among them was a man who was married to a very beautiful woman

999
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:46,160
alas she died a short time after they were married leaving him in despair

1000
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:55,200
his grief drove him crazy and he took his most beautiful bow and shot many arrows into the sky

1001
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:03,680
but he shot his bow so hard that each arrow tore a hole in the sky giving birth to a star

1002
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:11,200
light came streaming out of those stars toward the earth and fell on the archer who had created them

1003
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:18,480
everyone in the village watched in wonder and when the light had dispersed they saw that the

1004
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:25,440
archer had become a bear as white as you lars the hunters were terrified and wanted to kill the

1005
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:32,400
bear man who had to flee for his life he walked and walked for a very long time before he arrived

1006
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:39,440
in our land of ice and snow in this white land of ours he discovered a simpler life than that of

1007
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:46,160
people and he at last found the peace that had disappeared when his wife died the constellation

1008
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:54,160
was named after that lovesick archer the four stars that formed the square were born with his arrows

1009
01:26:54,160 --> 01:27:03,280
i'm just a cob represent the hunters who chased away oh boy i have no idea i'm certainly glad i came

1086
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:12,420
don't need any of that you know can you hint what next week will be uh do you um do you mean like

1087
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:25,700
schedule wise um well next week i i'm gonna have two asmr streams that's the plan anyways

1088
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:36,100
i i really want to first see like the feedback i guess after tomorrow stream basically if in

1089
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:49,060
tomorrow's asmr stream uh you know goes well and you like it uh then my plan is uh next week to

1090
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:59,140
have two asmr streams but that's but that's like um that's assuming that you you will you will like

1091
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:04,340
it because like because because like if i do an asmr stream tomorrow and everyone is like

1092
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:14,580
man that shit fucking sucks i hate the background noise it ruins it it's fucking trash um i'm gonna

1093
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:24,100
have to do probably something else because you know i don't want to do an asmr stream if if if uh

1094
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:30,900
you're not going to enjoy it obviously we would never we will love it it will be great

1095
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:38,260
i have feeling people will like it now i'm gonna kill tomorrow uh i guess i just i guess i keep

1096
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:46,020
getting worried about background noise because like i want to like with where i live right now

1097
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:52,180
i'm not allowed to like modify anything in the apartment so only when like

1098
01:38:52,180 --> 01:39:00,900
i move around like september i'll be trying to find an apartment where like i could have like

1099
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:12,100
a room and make sure to like uh you know put like those thingies so that uh it's it's good for asmr

1100
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:21,140
and a quiet and stuff because right now like you can hear what the 3do like picks up um what my

1101
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:29,620
neighbors do anything like like upstairs or when like carves drive outside like from the window

1102
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:34,500
or like if anyone talks like outside like out the window then you can hear it too so

1103
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:44,660
i guess i'm pretty nervous about that uh you'll do great now that yourself will be fine so

1104
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:51,220
hard any of this oh well that's because i'm not using the 3do right now this mic uh doesn't pick up

1105
01:39:51,220 --> 01:39:59,940
anywhere as much as uh anywhere as much as the 3do gonna love your voice doing ASMR i hope so i hope

1106
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:06,420
you will enjoy it uh i'm sure it would be fantastic no matter what i see and the background noise

1107
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:11,140
doesn't bother us imi had background noise and it was still great uh i feel like her background

1108
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:19,940
noise was like very minimal so that's why i'm worried um blah blah blah blah uh i forgot what

1109
01:40:19,940 --> 01:40:27,860
do you think about singing stream uh do you mean like a karaoke stream i am uh by no means a good

1110
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:35,460
singer uh i can't sing or anything but i do plan on doing some karaoke streams but like you know

1111
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:41,620
just for fun like when i do karaoke streams i'm like fucking around basically so so if you

1112
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:49,780
ever come to my karaoke streams please don't expect me to like sing well or anything like that it's

1113
01:40:49,780 --> 01:41:00,580
just for the big funny blah blah blah blah yes karaoke would be great yeah i would have to be

1114
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:09,780
drunk karaoke it would have to be drunk karaoke because like uh because uh blah blah blah i would

1115
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:17,540
be nervous singing otherwise let me let me change to my my just my just chatting things i can be like

1116
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:32,980
okay okay now now now that's that's a bit better i think

1117
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:41,460
that's a bit better now now i'm like now you can see me now you can see me a lot better while we

1118
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:50,660

1120

1121
01:42:03,380 --> 01:42:11,140
never mind it's it's on uh let's see what else sorry i'm trying to like scroll through through

1122
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:24,260
the chat and stuff like that um look chat i'll have my pen lights i read it as penis lights not

1123
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:32,980
gonna lie like i've read what you said i'll have my pen lights out for ic and i read it as something

1124
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:42,500
else chance of russian songs in karaoke um maybe maybe maybe i could find like a song or

1125
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:49,220
tour or something like that drunk karaoke sounds even more fun yeah it will be fun i i get like

1126
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:57,300
even more ridiculous when i drink so it will be even more fun let's hear a drink of choice for

1127
01:42:57,300 --> 01:43:06,740
drunk karaoke DJ streams i usually um just try to find uh the sweetest wine that i can find and

1128
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:14,580
then drink like pretty much almost the whole bottle what matters to me is that the wine is sweet

1129
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:23,060
if it's sweet then i'm happy if it's like dry and bitter then i don't i don't like it

1130
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:30,660
yeah let's see

1131
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:33,460
chat chat chat

1132
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:43,940
mrs was very careful with her stream yeah i i i don't know what's gonna happen in my stream

1133
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:51,860
i'll be honest whatever feels natural i'm just gonna go with whatever feels right because i need

1134
01:43:51,860 --> 01:44:00,420
to buy some ASMR triggers i i don't have uh i don't have too much right now

1135
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:08,420
rap i might try but i'm probably gonna suck at it

1136
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:10,980
um

1137
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:16,420
i see can you do a stream where you teach us russian

1138
01:44:21,460 --> 01:44:25,220
i i could try but i feel like i would be a really terrible teacher

1139
01:44:25,780 --> 01:44:32,980
like i don't know what it is but i don't feel i feel like i'm not good at teaching i don't know

1140
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:39,460
but maybe maybe if it was something that you were interested in um

1141
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:47,860
will you perhaps do a russian ASMR stream in the future i see uh i already got asked this question

1142
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:59,780
on one of my moros actually uh so during my ASMR streams uh if enough people want me to uh i can

1143
01:44:59,780 --> 01:45:07,300
definitely uh you know do some russian like here and there i don't want it to be like the main

1144
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:13,380
focus or anything like i want to keep it in english and stuff but i could like maybe like do some

1145
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:23,940
russian words here and there or like um russian sentences sentences uh here and there uh i feel

1146
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:31,860
like that would be okay do you drink vodka if i drink vodka i like it to be flavored like there

1147
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:38,580
is a lot of vodkas that are like flavored and they're like sweet but then again yeah if it's

1148
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:46,740
sweet and flavor then yeah uh are you a lightweight yeah i am i'm i'm very lightweight to be honest

1149
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:48,660
especially with wine

1150
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:49,860
um

1151
01:45:56,740 --> 01:46:02,180
if you're creative almost anything can be used for ASMR yeah exactly you can make sounds

1152
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:07,060
with like anything really but i want to make sure that the sounds are good but then again like

1153
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:12,660
ASMR triggers is like there's there's always people who are going to like some triggers

1154
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:19,700
and people who don't like some triggers so if you see me doing like a trigger then you're not a

1155
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:26,020
big fan of you can always just like mute and unmute when i am done so there's that

1156
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:40,100
uh you could just roast us when we don't get it uh i know i could but i don't know i i think

1157
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:49,300
i'm gonna keep it like nice and and cute for the ASMR streams are you better at russian than

1158
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:59,060
english i'm actually no actually no i am better at english than in russian because i rarely speak

1159
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:06,580
russian at this point like i only speak russian uh with my parents you know so because i rarely use

1160
01:47:06,580 --> 01:47:14,580
russian uh you know when like you don't use a language much uh with time you you know forget

1161
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:20,180
some words and stuff like that so sometimes when i talk to my parents i need to like google

1162
01:47:20,180 --> 01:47:27,620
certain words and like i'm trying to like explain stuff and i'm like what's the word for that what's

1163
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:39,300
the word for this and that and i'm just uh yeah so my russian is not as good as it used to be

1164
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:46,660
because i just speak english 99 of the time you know and i only use russian with my parents so

1165
01:47:58,580 --> 01:47:59,460
let me see

1166
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:11,620
hey i was wondering if ASMR vods are locked behind patreon uh no we're we're not we're not supposed

1167
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:19,620
to have vods in our patreon because apparently youtube is making a fuss about it and it's not

1168
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:29,460
allowed or something like that um so you know again if if you want to make sure that you have a

1169
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:38,180
vod then you will have to archive it or hope that anyone else archives it and like shares a link for

1170
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:46,420
it um i think she should do an ASMR where she drinks ice water that would actually make like a pretty

1171
01:48:46,420 --> 01:48:53,060
good sound like if i if i got like some ice and i put it like in the water and then i moved it around

1172
01:48:53,060 --> 01:49:00,500
that actually makes for a really nice trigger so yeah the only two triggers i don't like are eating

1173
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:08,340
and marker sound what is what is marker sounds like when you use a marker and like draw with it or

1174
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:11,060
what do you mean um

1175
01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:21,860
are you born and raised in russia no i was actually born i was born in ukraine

1176
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:31,860
and my parents uh taught me russian instead of ukrainian because they were like russian is used

1177
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:40,900
a lot more than ukrainian so they decided to just teach me russian instead uh but yeah i'm

1178
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:47,300
i'm ukrainian like i was i was born in ukraine but uh i speak russian because that's what my parents

1179
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:52,820
taught me when i was a child um let me see

1180
01:49:58,820 --> 01:50:05,380
oh this uh sorry i'm i'm still i'm still trying to like to like uh try and read everything

1181
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:14,660
and it's hard so i'm sorry if i if i miss some stuff uh i'm not used to having uh chat uh have

1182
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:22,020

01:54:29,140 --> 01:54:33,780
yes i'm already a hiccup drunk ASMR i mean you're gonna hear my hiccups like either way

either way during the ASMR stream even tomorrow so uh i don't even need to be drunk for that to

1214
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:47,060
happen i see being cute no matter what she does uh i'm i'm glad i'm glad that you think that because

1215
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:53,380
there's a lot of moments where i'm like uh i don't know if i'm cute and i don't know if i'm

1216
01:54:54,420 --> 01:55:01,860
if i'm like i don't know sometimes sometimes i get worried and insecure and worried that i'm not

1217
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:12,900
cute enough and stuff um i'm happy that you want to share so much with us yeah of course i think

1218
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:19,540
i think it's such a nice thing to i don't know like share these like stuff you know

1219
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:29,220
it just like brings brings me joy to be able to talk about it uh to to people who want to listen

1220
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:34,980
to it you know because like i could talk to anyone about this stuff but it's not the same

1221
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:41,300
if they don't really want to listen so so like hearing that you do want me to do a zatsu stream

1222
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:47,380
just tapping about my good memories and share photographs from childhood makes me happy because

1223
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:54,500
it's like oh thanks they actually carry on and they want to hear it you know so that's that's

1224
01:55:54,500 --> 01:56:07,060
really nice uh you're always cute i see don't mean secure you're an adorable princess thank you i'm

1225
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:13,940
trying i'm trying uh every every stream i i will get more and more confident and then

1226
01:56:13,940 --> 01:56:19,460
a year from now hopefully uh i will gain much more confidence

1227
01:56:22,580 --> 01:56:28,980
i can listen to icf about everything play games i'm glad that makes me happy to hear that

1228
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:36,820
um i see epic big content yeah i'm glad you think so i'm glad you don't find it like

1229
01:56:36,820 --> 01:56:41,700
annoying i guess sometimes i'm also worried that like i talk too much and i'm like

1230
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:48,740
and i'm just like man who cares like wow you know

1231
01:56:53,380 --> 01:56:56,900
man i i need to figure out like why am i trying to pause this sometimes

1232
01:56:57,540 --> 01:57:02,980
i don't understand why it does that like my cpu is completely fine like there's nothing wrong with

1233
01:57:02,980 --> 01:57:06,180
it and phone is charged do a thing

1234
01:57:10,900 --> 01:57:18,500
i gotta see a teeny baby kaba i see yeah you're well that's why i'm super cute i really like

1235
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:24,660
how chill your streams are the other girls are cool too but sometimes it's sensory overload for me

1236
01:57:24,660 --> 01:57:31,220
i'm i'm surprised you're saying that like i feel like mine is very sensory overload if anything

1237
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:37,860
because because you know especially today like i was just like screaming a lot today and getting

1238
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:46,180
jump scared and and like getting loud and i feel i feel if there's someone who is sensory

1239
01:57:46,180 --> 01:57:52,580
overload that's me honestly to be honest

1240
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:07,780
i love your accent though i always like when you talk thank you i'm i'm glad to hear that

1241
01:58:08,660 --> 01:58:10,900
how much you hear that um

1242
01:58:14,100 --> 01:58:20,820
annoying and i should never be used in a sentence oh that's sweet

1243
01:58:22,100 --> 01:58:29,300
maybe the connection between your phone and computer causing freezes could that be it i wonder

1244
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:36,820
i wonder if that could be that i'm not sure maybe i'll hopefully hopefully i can figure that out

1245
01:58:38,260 --> 01:58:41,460
blah blah blah blah blah blah

1246
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:51,140
it's such a nice contrast to your normal talking voice wait what do you mean when i'm like

1247
01:58:52,180 --> 01:58:57,620
like do you mean like my yapping voice or something like that or are you talking about like

1248
01:58:57,620 --> 01:59:04,500
when i do like ASMR or something sorry i'm i'm a bit confused i guess a little bit confused

1249
01:59:05,060 --> 01:59:11,220
would you play a horror game in the future you have really funny reactions to being scared

1250

1315
02:07:46,580 --> 02:07:52,100
