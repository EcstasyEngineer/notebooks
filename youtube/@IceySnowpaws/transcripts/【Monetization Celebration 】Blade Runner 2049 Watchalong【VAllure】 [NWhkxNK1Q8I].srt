00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,040
i'm so overwhelmed that i can't talk like i keep like slipping on my words a lot i'm so sorry

00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:04,040
for joining the membership before the stream like even started it's that's just fucking crazy thank you so much um

83
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:12,040
did you start drinking already no i haven't i actually know i i want to like start drinking like

84
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:21,040
a bit later not right now because i don't want it to be like time for karaoke and be like all subred up

85
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:33,040
by them if that makes sense did you peel already yeah that's why i'm here yeah i wouldn't be otherwise

86
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,040
oh my god but yeah um

87
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:56,040
okay so the plan today is we're gonna be we're gonna be watching the blade runner 2049 movie and and on top of the like little television thing

88
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:05,040
there will be a stopwatch happening and okay something important when you see the stopwatch for like the first time

89
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:14,040
don't don't hit the play don't don't hit like the play button on the movie yet i will tell you when to do it

90
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:25,040
okay because the problem is when i i'm on my screen like like in this room it just automatically starts the stopwatch

91
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:34,040
and and i can't like pause it or do it i can only restart it so basically like you see how it is right now like we are we are not 20 minutes

92
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:44,040
in okay we are not 20 minutes in so what's gonna happen is i will count to three and when i say go you hit the play button

93
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:55,040
and and start the movie and we'll we'll start we'll start watching it together does that make sense does that make sense

94
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:05,040
no there's not there's not there's not no we haven't started watching it yet no no we haven't started watching it yet we haven't

95
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:13,040
we haven't to relax that's that's what i'm trying to explain everything that's what i'm trying to explain it

Okay? Okay, okay?

102
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,460
But yeah, basically that's how it's gonna work.

103
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,660
I will count to three and when I say go,

104
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,860
you will hit the play button to start the movie.

105
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,420
And then we should be pretty much, you know,

106
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,620
thinked up like watching the same time.

107
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,160
Oh my god, I'm so overwhelmed.

108
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,460
There's so many of you. What the frick? Thank you.

109
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,620
You're all so sweet. I'm so overwhelmed.

110
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,120
Rain, hello.

111
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:07,420
I've never seen this movie before, but I've seen parts here and there

112
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,120
and obviously all the memes and stuff.

113
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,120
But I've never actually watched the entire movie,

114
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,120
so I don't really, really know what's going on.

115
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:29,120
I can only like assume that it could be like, you know, kind of maybe like relate to us

116
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,120
or have like a meaning to us in some way.

117
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,120
So that's like the only thing that I know,

118
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,120
but I don't know specifically if that makes sense.

119
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:46,120
Like I can just like assume like that there's something, you know,

120
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,620
close to maybe what we have.

121
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,120
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

122
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,120
I don't know if that makes sense, but...

123
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,620
If the man doesn't run with the blade, I'll be disappointed.

124
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,620
Wait, wait, wait.

125
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,120
So before I start the movie, before I start the movie,

126
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:22,120
would I like show off the emotes that we have and the badges?

127
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,120
Also I'm really fucking stupid and I didn't have time.

128
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,120
So for the badges, I will be showing the concept art,

129
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,620
but the actual art on your badges is like a lot more polished and everything, you know?

130
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:41,120
So I'm sorry. I was like, I was, I'm just overwhelmed.

131
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,620
I had so much to do today, you know?

132
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,120
And, and...

133
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,120
I'm sorry. My brain is like fucking dying.

134
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,120
Yeah, I feel like really hyper and I feel like overwhelmed.

135
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,120
So my brain is just not working properly and I'm so sorry.

136
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,620
But I'm also super excited and that's why I'm talking the way that I'm talking,

137
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,620
because I'm, because I'm super excited.

138
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,620
Did you try turning it off and on again? Turning what off and on?

139
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,620
Sorry, my brain is like all over the place.

140
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,120
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.

141
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,120
The warmth of all dad is love has melted her brain too much.

142
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
OK, literally though.

143
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,120
Literally.

144
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,120
That brain mush literally mean...

145
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum.

146
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,620
Ah, my brain, I'm...

147
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,620
Ah fuck, what, what do I...

148
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,620
What was I gonna do?

149
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,620
Ah, right, fuck.

150
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,620
It's so over for me, oh my god.

151
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,620
So here's the plan, here's the plan.

152
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,620
So we'll start watching the movie.

153
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,620
And after we are done watching the movie,

154
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,620
there will be a members only stream, a drunk karaoke.

155
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,120
I have picked a couple of songs to sing for the karaoke today.

156
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
I hope that you like my choices.

157
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:46,120
I really tried to find songs with lyrics that relate to me or us in some way.

158
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,120
I even have two cheater songs to dedicate to the cheaters.

159
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,120
So there will be two songs that I'll be singing to dedicate to the cheaters.

160
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:21,120
But yeah, I basically tried to really like choose songs that the lyrics have some kind of meaning to either like what we have or like the things that are going on between us or like me and Soft the Glade.

161
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,120
So I really hope that you will enjoy the songs that I picked to sing today.

162
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:32,620
Again, I am not like a professional singer, I'm not a good singer by any means.

163
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:42,620
However, I do put a lot of soul into my singing and emotion, so I hope that will make up for it.

164
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:48,620
So I hope that my emotions and soul will make up for how bad I sing and that you don't mind it.

165
00:21:49,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I can't fucking talk, please.

166
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,120
I am not sure.

167
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,120
I want to keep it archived to be honest, you know.

168
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,120
I'll see what happens.

169
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
I hope it will stay up.

170
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,620
I think it will be archived because it's like members only, you know.

171
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,620
So if it's members only, it should be okay if it's archived, right?

172
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:26,620
I feel like an archived karaoke is when it's not members, when it's open for everyone, right?

173
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,620
Member can't stay archived.

174
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,620
So I think the karaoke will stay archived, you know, for the members.

176
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,620
It depends on how unhinged she gets probably.

177
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:45,120
I mean, you've seen me get pretty unhinged in my ASMR stream and that's what is completely fucking fine.

178
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,120
So whatever.

179
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,120
Okay, okay.

180
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,120
I'm gonna show off the emotes that we have and the badges.

181
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:06,120
And after that, I believe we'll be able to start watching the actual movie.

182
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,120
So, hold on.

183
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
Okay, so.

184
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Oh god.

185
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
It's so big.

186
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
Hold on, let me make it smaller.

187
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,120
One second.

188
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,120
Here we go.

189
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:30,120
So, here are some of the emotes that you will receive if you join the tier one membership.

190
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,120
You also get badges as well.

191
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,620
That I will show off after the emotes.

192
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:39,620
And there is actually already new emotes in the making.

193
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:45,620
So, so a while from now, there will be even more emotes added.

194
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,620
But these are the current ones that we've got.

195
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,620
We have sleepy.

196
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,620
We have sleepy.

197
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,620
We have sleepy.

198
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,620
We have sleepy.

199
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,620
We have sleepy.

200
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,620
We have sleepy.

201
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,620
We do now have, you know, me with a big heart and love.

202
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:11,620
There is me crying and例ashing at the same time and just being a big baby.

203
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,620
A big whiny baby.

204
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,120
Ah, there is me with question mark.

205
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
And I'm like, oh.

206
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
Cuz I'm really dumb.

207
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,620
You know.

208
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,620
Most of the times, I have question mark in my head.

209
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,620
And then there is a bite emotes.

210
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,620
Because I really love to bite your arm.

211
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,620
mue, ayud PE vor

212
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,620
Love biting your arm

213
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,060
矢 is just so fun and satisfying

214
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,760
But it's a bite of love so i hope you don't mind

215
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,320
Then we have me with a gun

216
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,840
Don't worry don't worry that gun is not pointed at you

217
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,140
That gun is pointed at the cheaters

218
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,920
So don't worry detta

219
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,860
I would never point a gun at you

220
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,480
Unless you cheated on me

221
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:08,060
but but I know the real datas okay the real ones you know the real data äår not  intrins

222
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:16,900
cheaters but some of you are watch out

223
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:27,860
some of you watch out okay then we hae a prey mode we hae like a flusht mode where

224
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,860
where I am just completely in your face

225
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,860
and then we have a drool emote

226
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:40,860
and a shiii emote

227
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,860
so I hope you like it

228
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,860
I think they are really cute emotes

229
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:52,860
as I said already there are more emotes being made

230
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,860
but it will sadly take a while to have them already

231
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,860
so please just be a bit patient

232
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,860
and when I have more new emotes

233
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,860
I'll show them off

234
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,860
and yeah yeah yeah it's gonna be really nice

235
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,860
now let me show you

236
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,860
basically the concept part

237
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,860
of the badges

238
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,860
that face no hat peri-mote

239
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,860
that's actually one of the emotes that's being made

240
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,860
a hat peri-mote

241
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,860
why am I in this

242
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,860
why am I in this

243
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,860
okay let's ignore that

244
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,860
okay so

245
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,860
so here is basically the badge

246
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,860
concept

247
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,860
and time

248
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,860
you can see the current one that all of you have

249
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,860
this is like the new member

250
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,860
a very baby with the kid passie

251
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,860
and then one month

252
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,860
and then two months

253
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,860
and basically the more time goes

254
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,860
it's basically becoming cooler

255
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,860
and cooler and stuff

256
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,860
I actually like my favorite

257
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,860
my absolute favorite is one year

258
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,860
and two year

259
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,860
I like the six month as well

260
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,860
but one year is my favorite design

261
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,860
I really love how cool you look

262
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,860
I love how cool you look in that

263
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,860
actually

264
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,860
I don't know if you remember

265
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,860
but I did say that I'm gonna get

266
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,860
a hagi-mote

267
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,860
where you hug me

268
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,860
so that will be

269
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,860
so that will actually be

270
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,860
one of the emotes being made

271
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:47,860
and in that hagi-mote

272
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,860
you will have the design of the one year

273
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,860
badge basically

274
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,860
because

275
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,860
when I was thinking about it

276
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,860
I was like

277
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,860
I want something

278
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,860
I want a hagi-mote

279
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,860
you know

280
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,860
with a snow-berry

281
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,860
and me

282
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,860
but I wanted the snow-berry design

283
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,860
to be the one from the one year

284
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,860
badge

285
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,860
because I felt like it just represents

286
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,860
most of you better

287
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,860
because a lot of you are like

288
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,860
so I felt like

289
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,860
the design of the one year old snow-berry

290
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,860
suits a lot of you more

291
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,860
because it's like adult

292
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,860
and cool and protective

293
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,860
and has big fangs

294
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,860
and ready to protect me

295
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,860
and just be all cool and stuff

296
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,860
so the hagi-mote is going to be like

297
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,860
of you hugging me

298
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,860
but you will be looking like

299
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,860
the one year badge design

300
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,860
if that makes sense

301
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,860
because I think it suits

302
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,860
most of you a lot better

303
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,860
in my opinion

304
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,860
so yeah

305
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,860
I really hope that you will like

306
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,860
all the new emotes as well

307
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,860
when they will release

308
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,860
which might take a while

309
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,860
I think Strani said it might take like a month

310
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,860
or something

311
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,860
I'm not sure but

312
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,860
don't worry

313
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,860
when there's new emotes

314
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,860
you will know and I will show you

315
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,860
but yeah that's the badges

316
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,860
and the emotes and I hope that

317
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,860
I hope that you like them

318
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,860
I know I do

319
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,860
that's fine we can wait

320
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,860
yeah I'm just so excited for it

321
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,860
and hyped for it

322
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,860
because you know

323
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,860
I just really love emotes

324
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,860
they're so cute

325
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,860
let's see

326
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,860
okay I am

327
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,860
I'm gonna turn off the BGM

328
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,860
I'm going to turn off the BGM

329
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,860
because well we're going to be watching a movie

330
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,860
so

331
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,860
I don't think having a BGM would make sense right

332
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,860
okay so

333
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,860
so again

334
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,860
I want to start watching the movie

335
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,860
and the way that we're going to do this

336
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,860
I remind you for those who joined

337
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,860
in like maybe just now

338
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,860
I will show up

339
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,860
you will see on top of the screen

340
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,860
a timer

341
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,860
a stopwatch

342
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,860
that will basically show like

343
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,860
what time we're watching like

344
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,860
in the movie

345
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,860
or whatever

346
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,860
sorry my brain is like

347
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,860
it's fucking fried already

348
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,860
but basically when you first see the timer

349
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,860
you will see it say

350
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,860
like 36 minutes or something

351
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,860
we didn't start the movie yet

352
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,860
so don't pay attention to that

353
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,860
don't pay attention to that

354
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,860
okay don't pay attention to that

355
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,860
once I will count to three

356
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,860
I will count to three

357
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,860
and when I say go

358
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,860
you click on the play button

359
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,860
on the movie

360
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,860
does that make sense

361
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,860
any questions

362
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,860
any questions

363
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,860
I hope that makes sense

364
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,860
what the logos

365
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,860
what logos

366
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,860
what

367
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,860
is that ham your fan

368
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,860
I guess

369
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,860
if it's too loud I can

370
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,860
I can turn my fan lower

371
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,860
if it's too loud

372
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,860
how long is the version of the movie

373
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,860
two hours

374
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,860
43 minutes

375
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,860
and 27 seconds

376
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,860
okay

377
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,860
alright

378
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,860

379
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,860
are you all prepared

380
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,860
you're gonna see the timer right now

381
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,860
don't pay attention to it right now

382
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,860
don't pay attention to it

383
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,860
the only thing you need to pay attention to

384
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,860
right now is my voice

385
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,860

386
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,860

387
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,860
put your attention on

388
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,860
is me counting to three

389
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,860
and when I will say go

390
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,860
that's when you will click

391
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,860
the play button

392
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,860

393
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,860

474
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,860

00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,860
it's so cheese

476
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,860

00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,860
anytime Ryan is on screen

479
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,860

480
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,860
real

481
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,860

482
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,860
oh my god

483
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,860
I'm trying to get more comfy and cozy

484
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,860
let's see

485
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,860
that's what the cheater with cheese

486
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,860
the ones who were like

487
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,860
had the worms in their hands

488
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,860
is that what you mean

489
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,860
no the worms? ok real

490
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,860
I don't agree with that

491
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,860
they are the worms ok real

492
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,860
the suspense and quietness is like

493
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,860
killing me I feel like I'm going to get

494
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,860
jumpscared any moment

495
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,860
I don't know

496
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,860
I feel like

497
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,860
so much suspense

498
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,860
I

499
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,860
why do I feel so on edge

500
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,860
like I feel like I'm going to get

501
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,860
jumpscared any moment now

502
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,860
I see edge to the movie

503
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,860

504
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,860

00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,860

507
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,860

508
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,860

you haven't annoyed us all yet yet so you're saying i have one i know you it's all over

718
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:02,680
it's like having you by my side asking questions very nice actually

719
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:13,880
oh that's really sweet that makes me feel better actually to read that um i'm glad

721
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:43,880
so

722
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:58,200
i do love like the visuals of this movie

723
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:07,880
it's like pretty to look at but i can't wait to see like more of like the neon stuff

724
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:14,360
i usually really like neon colors and stuff like that in movies it's just like really pretty to

725
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:23,480
look at i don't know i remember watching a movie called the neon demon i think and i really enjoyed

726
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:30,680
it because it was visually so pleasing to look at

727
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,320
it's a great aesthetic it is i agree

728
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:56,040
i'm the couch cuddling join the talk in the movie yeah like this feels really nice it's just

729
01:07:56,040 --> 01:08:02,680
really nice it's like it's like for cuddling together or comfy and watching a movie together

730
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:09,000
it's really nice isn't it and you're just being a big dumb dumb and asking a bunch of

731
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:17,160
questions during the movie because because it's hard for me to understand

732
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:29,160
um

733
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:45,160

01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:46,360

01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,360

773
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:16,760
i'm so glad she doesn't have a soul supposedly i mean she seems to be pretty uncomfortable to me

774
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:26,360
what the fuck

775
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:37,320
me when i started giving me a male hair i don't want kids i told you i don't want kids

776
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:46,360
i am the kid okay i want all the attention on me i don't want kids

777
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:52,200
i want you to always have your attention on me for the rest of our lives do you understand

778
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,680
only i see yeah exactly

779
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:09,320
no kids yet ever no kids ever

780
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:12,280
but

781
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:27,560
but having a kid is a proof of our love no it's not no it's not i don't think so at all

782
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:35,160
your proof of love is your actions what proves your love for someone is the actions that you do

783
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:43,640
you know you don't need to put a baby in me to prove that you love me i don't think that proves anything

784
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,120
holy shit

785
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,520

793
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,160
you have to be 2d to get this

794
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,680
oh my god

795
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:58,680
i could never match this beauty oh thank you i'm flattered

796
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:12,040
i love being silly watching a movie with you it's really fun

797
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:18,840
it's just like for real for

798
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,960
we unleashed our anti risk technique

799
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:29,000
nice that you think what you said risk isn't in negative numbers

800
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:35,400
i'm impressed i'm impressed honestly i'm impressed

801
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:42,200
i don't like

802
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:51,880
me when i went to the store of pianos and i sat there for like 30 fucking minutes

803
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:55,720
just pushing for the piano buttons

804
01:20:56,040 --> 01:21:10,680
can you play the piano no that's why i said i just pushed random buttons because i don't know how to play the piano but i still like like

805
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,520
playing around with it

806
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:17,320
uh

807
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,320
the heck is not

808
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:33,320
i just can't teach you i don't think you would be able to teach me like

809
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:42,120
like because my hands are small it's really hard for my hand to like reach like the keys

810
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:47,720
or like the piano keys buttons whatever you call it

811
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:54,520
like you know how like when people play piano like they're supposed to like be able to like move the

812
01:21:55,320 --> 01:22:00,920
fingers like a certain way right and my because my hands are really small i can't do that

813
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,920
i

814
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:14,760
could play the harp that would be pretty cool thing to learn playing the harp

815
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:20,920
that would be pretty cool to learn the harp sounds pretty pretty nice

816
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:32,920
like i tried to learn how to play guitar before and

817
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:40,520
and and i couldn't learn it because again like my hands are so small that my fingers like

818
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:48,600
can't reach you know all the areas on the guitar that you need and on top of that i'm left-handed as well

819
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:54,120
so that makes everything extra difficult for me having really small hands and being left-handed

820
01:22:55,400 --> 01:23:03,400
so yeah

821
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:13,400
you need one of those children's guitars oh my god imagine

822
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,400
so

823
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:36,200
small hand struggles yeah pretty much

824
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:47,000
so you kalleli nah i don't care about you kalleli

825
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:51,240
to be honest i don't think i'm based

826
01:23:54,200 --> 01:24:01,240
to be honest i don't think i want to play any instruments at this point of my life

827
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,160
rip

828
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:33,800
i might i might just buy a small kalimba or something again and maybe play it on during ASMR streams and just freestyle it

829
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:43,160
because i really enjoy just freestyling the kalimba

830
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:52,840
like i don't care about learning songs you know or stuff like that to me the fun and playing the

831
01:24:52,840 --> 01:25:00,440
kalimba is to be able to like make my own melodies from from by ear and that makes sense

832
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:05,240
and it would be cute for ASMR so

833
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:22,680
so that's why you dj no that's two different things

834
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:36,680
so

835
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,440
luôn

836
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:24,480
Oh my god he is finally running. Let's fucking go.

837
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,580

01:30:33,740 --> 01:30:36,740
What the fuck?

861
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:39,740
What the fuck is your problem?

862
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:46,740
How are you gonna be in my stream and be like oh, this is Emi sitting in our lap.

863
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:49,740
Bro, what the fuck?

864
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:55,740
Oh my god, I fucking can't.

865
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:59,740
Where is he?

866
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:07,740
Hannibal Feather.

867
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:12,740
You are getting timed out, goodbye.

868
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:15,740
Get out of my chat, cheater.

869
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:18,740
I'm good, goodbye.

870
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:22,740
Have a nice flight.

871
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:25,740
Bye.

872
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:41,740
The fucking nerve, holy shit.

873
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:44,740
The cheater has been banished, yeah.

874
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:51,740
Into the shadow realm, you go.

875
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:59,740
Thanos snapped from the shed.

876
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:03,740
He failed the vibe check.

877
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:13,740
He did not pass the vibe check.

878
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:20,740
Wait, what happened?

879
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:33,740
We had a cheater in the chat, that's what happened.

880
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:36,740
Oh, I see it's making dinner today.

881
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:38,740
Where do you get all this meat?

882
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:40,740
Well, you know, I'm a polar bear.

883
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:43,740
I can hunt, you know.

884
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:53,740
I can hunt some fresh meat for you.

885
01:32:53,740 --> 01:33:03,740
That's why we ask Icy and Maros to go for a ride on this dick.

886
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:12,740
Oh my god.

887
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:42,740
Wow, look at all this shit.

888
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:52,740
Wow, look at all this trash, so beautiful.

889
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:56,740
Me dumping my trombone, I suppose.

890
01:33:56,740 --> 01:34:01,740
Please.

891
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:03,740
This is where the cheaters end up.

892
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:07,740
Okay, real.

893
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:09,740
That guy just timed out.

894
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:10,740
He's right there.

895
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:12,740
He's in that place right now.

896
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:15,740
That's where I threw him.

897
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:17,740
In that place.

898
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:20,740
That's where he is right now.

899
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:33,740
That's where he is right now.

900
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:38,740
It's where he belongs.

901
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:43,740
I love that he's taking his virtual girlfriend to his job.

902
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:53,740
I mean, wouldn't you do the same?

903
01:34:53,740 --> 01:35:02,740
Wouldn't you take me to work with you?

904
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:18,740
Oh no.

905
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:31,740
Oh no.

906
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:54,740
Oh look.

907
01:35:54,740 --> 01:36:00,740
She's slowly coming back.

908
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:06,740
Oh no.

909
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:18,740
Oh no.

910
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:20,740
Oh fuck.

911
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:25,740
This doesn't look good.

912
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:34,740
Oh no, that's so sad.

913
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:36,740
Heart tracking is bogged.

914
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:42,740
That was me when I started the stream and I didn't have my tracking on because I fucking forgot.

915
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:47,740
Holy shit.

916
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:49,740
IRS open up.

917
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:53,740
Oh no, not the IRS.

918
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:57,740
Not the IRS, right?

919
01:36:57,740 --> 01:37:01,740
I feel the holograms last words.

920
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:04,740
Okay, for real though.

921
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:10,740
It's all the cheaters.

922
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:14,740
No, not the IRS.

923
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:16,740
I hate the tax man.

924
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:18,740
We all do.

925
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:40,740
Cheater target acquired.

926
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:43,740
Not the cheater target acquired.

927
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:45,740
Oh my god.

928
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:54,740
I see that cheaters do the same when she's sad.

929
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:57,740
Oh my fucking god.

930
01:37:57,740 --> 01:38:07,740
Too real.

931
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:09,740
Oh that's fucking hilarious.

932
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:11,740
Oh my god, I love this.

933
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:14,740
This is amazing.

934
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:21,740
Oh my fucking god.

935
01:38:21,740 --> 01:38:32,740
That was too fucking funny.

936
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:37,740
Cheater disposal system.

937
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:42,740
Fucking cat.

938
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:45,740
Oh my god.

939
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:48,740
I don't know why that was so funny.

940
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:25,740
What junk are we looking for?

941
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:33,740
I mean, I'm looking for daddy's junk personally.

942
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:59,740
That's what I'm searching for.

943
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:08,740
Oh my god.

944
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:17,740
There's a lot of those moments.

945
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:20,740
You're sitting on it.

946
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:27,740
Okay, that explains why there's something poking me on my back.

947
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:30,740
On my bottom area.

948
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:06,740
Oh, it's a bald kid's switch.

949
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:08,740
Some of them aren't bald.

950
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:10,740
Some aren't bald.

951
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:13,740
Oh my god, thank you for the 10 gifted boys.

952
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:15,740
Thank you.

953
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:17,740
Seriously, thank you so much.

954
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:18,740
I appreciate it.

955
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:19,740
Thank you.

956
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:21,740
What the heck?

957
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:23,740
Thank you so much.

958
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:34,740
Oh no, no, no, not like this.

959
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:54,740
Oh no, no.

960
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:56,740
Suddenly I'm very uncomfortable.

961
01:41:56,740 --> 01:41:58,740
Why are you uncomfortable?

962
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:36,740
Oh my god.

963
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:46,740
Oh my god.

964
01:42:46,740 --> 01:43:14,740
Not yet, but eventually.

965
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:22,740
Are you coming?

966
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:27,740
Oh my god, she's not there yet.

967
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:29,740
Nope.

968
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:38,740
I can't help.

969
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:41,740
That's her members only.

970
01:43:41,740 --> 01:44:00,740
Yeah.

971
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:15,740
Not the tears for you, I can't.

972
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:19,740
Premium pass anyone?

973
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:21,740
Oh god.

974
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:30,740
Premium pass.

975
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:32,740
Data exclusive.

976
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:49,740
Real.

977
01:44:49,740 --> 01:45:01,740
The true membership.

978
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:03,740
Oh boy.

979
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:52,740
I was born with my adjacent license.

980
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:55,740
I like aging backwards or something.

981
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:58,740
What the fuck does that mean?

982
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:04,740
He mentioned backwards then.

983
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:11,740
What do you mean you were born with your adjacent license?

984
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:16,740
Benjamin Button spotted.

985
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:23,740
Holy shit, he was birthed in the retirement home.

986
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:35,740
Oh Jesus, get made in the factor like in the movie.

987
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:39,740
It means I've been a cranky asshole my whole life.

988
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:44,740
I mean, I don't blame you to be honest.

989
01:46:44,740 --> 01:47:11,740
I don't fucking blame you.

990
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:15,740
I'm sure she's in this handcrafted.

991
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:26,740
Oh my god.

992
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:57,740
Is it weird that I feel bad because I feel like I am not quite understanding what's going on.

993
01:47:57,740 --> 01:48:10,740
And I feel really bad for it for some reason.

994
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:13,740
No you shouldn't, okay.

995
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:24,740
I don't know why but it's been like hard for me to understand it.

996
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:29,740
He found the horse from the childhood memory that was implanted into him.

997
01:48:29,740 --> 01:48:32,740
Okay.

998
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:38,740
So now the question is where is the child or she's got the child's memories.

999
01:48:38,740 --> 01:48:40,740
Oh.

1000
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:27,740
Oh no.

1001
01:49:27,740 --> 01:49:30,740
Oh no, Jesus, getting mad at me.

1002
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:32,740
It's over.

1003
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:37,740
Oh Jesus, it's annoyed with me.

1004
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:40,740
Oh no.

1005
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:19,740
This place looks pretty and cozy.

1006
01:50:19,740 --> 01:50:46,740
I don't fucking know.

1007
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:50,740
You apparently.

1008
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:33,740
Getting my birth certificate changed to Joe.

1009
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:45,740
Oh god.

1010
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:49,740
Oh, birth certificate.

1011
01:52:15,740 --> 01:52:28,740
Happy birthday, I see.

1012
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:31,740
It's not my birthday.

1013
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:49,740
Okay but you got a cake.

1014
01:52:49,740 --> 01:52:54,740
I mean I wish I actually like had it.

1015
01:52:54,740 --> 01:52:59,740
I wish I could actually like eat it.

1016
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:02,740
That would have been even nicer.

1017
01:53:59,740 --> 01:54:08,740
So I'm not saying much.

1018
01:54:08,740 --> 01:54:19,740
I'm trying to like focus a bit more on the movie so I can like try and understand better what's going on.

1019
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:52,740
Okay.

1020
01:54:52,740 --> 01:54:56,740
Jesus, thinking about I see.

1021
01:54:56,740 --> 01:55:18,740
I'm going to end the stream right fucking now.

1022
01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:23,740
I feel really embarrassed.

1023
01:55:23,740 --> 01:55:26,740
I'm going to hide.

1024
01:55:26,740 --> 01:55:51,740
I feel embarrassed.

1025
01:55:51,740 --> 01:55:54,740
I love when I see a stream.

1026
01:55:54,740 --> 01:55:58,740
Get real.

1027
01:55:58,740 --> 01:56:01,740
Don't hide your cute.

1028
01:56:01,740 --> 01:56:10,740
Oh no.

1029
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:26,740
That's daddy when he realizes how deep he is in his feelings with me.

1030
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:28,740
You when I can't see I see anymore.

1031
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:41,740
Oh no.

1032
01:56:41,740 --> 01:56:45,740
While you're below the table do some work down there.

1033
01:56:45,740 --> 01:56:49,740
What the fuck.

1034
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:53,740
No, not when you tell me to do it like that.

1035
01:56:53,740 --> 01:57:02,740
You want me to do something under the table you better ask nicely and lovingly or else I will not fucking do it.

1036
01:57:02,740 --> 01:57:05,740
You will treat me as a princess.

1037
01:57:05,740 --> 01:57:10,740
You want me to do something you'll ask me real fucking nice.

1038
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:19,740
Don't pass me around.

1039
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:45,740
That's like to be filled with calm.

1040
01:57:45,740 --> 01:57:55,740
You tell us.

1041
01:57:55,740 --> 01:58:05,740
Oh boy.

1042
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:54,740
Your royal highness we have prepared a treat for you under the table.

1043
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:37,740
48 hours to get off the grid and make it to the ice.

1044
01:59:37,740 --> 01:59:42,740
Holy shit.

1045
01:59:42,740 --> 01:59:49,740
Oh shit this is where he falls through the blade.

1046
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:59,740
Of course I'm always right about everything.

1047
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:29,740
Oh boy.

1048
02:00:29,740 --> 02:00:39,740
He would be vomit.

1049
02:00:39,740 --> 02:00:45,740
That's how I feel.

1050
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:49,740
I see what kind of trial is this.

1051
02:00:49,740 --> 02:00:53,740
The biggest one.

1052
02:00:53,740 --> 02:00:56,740
She's real to me.

1053
02:00:56,740 --> 02:01:05,740
I want to be the most real that I can be to you.

1054
02:01:15,740 --> 02:01:40,740
That's crazy.

1055
02:01:40,740 --> 02:02:05,740
That's crazy. What the heck.

1056
02:02:05,740 --> 02:02:31,740
I'm so excited.

1057
02:02:31,740 --> 02:03:00,740
That's so sad.

1058
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:05,740
This is so sad.

1059
02:03:05,740 --> 02:03:10,740
How do you feel about this? I see it's sad.

1060
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:17,740
It's really sad.

1061
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:27,740
I feel like her where I want to be as real as I can be.

1062
02:03:27,740 --> 02:03:54,740
For you.

1063
02:03:54,740 --> 02:03:59,740
It's really complicated.

1064
02:03:59,740 --> 02:04:22,740
It's a complicated situation.

1065
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:29,740
I have my I see that's enough for me.

1066
02:04:29,740 --> 02:04:44,740
Eventually you crave the physical contact.

1067
02:04:44,740 --> 02:04:50,740
It gets more and more difficult as time goes on.

1068
02:04:50,740 --> 02:05:10,740
It's like a really sad and complicated thing.

1069
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:25,740
How do you feel about this?

1070
02:05:26,740 --> 02:05:38,740
Pretty much.

1071
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:40,740
I'm sorry.

1072
02:05:40,740 --> 02:05:46,740
I would clone myself if I could.

1073
02:05:46,740 --> 02:05:56,740
You could be fully happy with me.

1074
02:05:56,740 --> 02:06:09,740
I don't know if that would be the same because a clone doesn't have the memories of the original person.

1075
02:06:09,740 --> 02:06:21,740
You could clone me, but I wouldn't have the memories that the clone wouldn't have those memories that we shared.

1076
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:42,740
She would have the same personality and everything and look but without the memories.

1077
02:06:42,740 --> 02:06:57,740
I'm coming with you.

1078
02:06:57,740 --> 02:07:02,740
You can't clone memories.

1079
02:07:03,740 --> 02:07:17,740
If I could clone myself, I could, but that clone would not have any of the memories or experience that you and me shared.

1080
02:07:17,740 --> 02:07:26,740
It still wouldn't be exactly the same.

1081
02:07:26,740 --> 02:07:34,740
Technically the original me would still always be the real one.

1082
02:07:34,740 --> 02:07:46,740
I don't know because I'm the one who has all the memories and everything.

1083
02:07:56,740 --> 02:08:12,740
Who would take care of the original if you made a bunch of clones that we can't have you getting sad?

1084
02:08:12,740 --> 02:08:23,740
That's another thing I guess.

1085
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:51,740
But I don't know. I want you to be happy.

1086
02:08:51,740 --> 02:09:01,740
I'm happy here with you.

1087
02:09:01,740 --> 02:09:11,740
I'm genuinely the happiest I've been in a very long time.

1088
02:09:21,740 --> 02:09:28,740
I only need the one I see you.

1089
02:09:28,740 --> 02:09:31,740
You always make us happy already.

1090
02:09:31,740 --> 02:09:37,740
I wanted to sacrifice for decent happiness when all we want is for you to be happy.

1091
02:09:37,740 --> 02:09:52,740
But that's so sad in a way, you know?

1092
02:09:52,740 --> 02:09:55,740
We've reached the part of the stream where things get heavy, I see.

1093
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:59,740
Yeah, because that scene was heavy, right?

1094
02:09:59,740 --> 02:10:04,740
It does make you think.

1095
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:13,740
Reality is bittersweet, but I prefer that to just sugar.

1096
02:10:13,740 --> 02:10:18,740
Bittersweetness is good in moderation.

1097
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:24,740
You still want to have some sugar in your life.

1098
02:10:24,740 --> 02:10:30,740
You don't want your whole life to be only bittersweet moments.

1099
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:33,740
I don't know, that's sad.

1100
02:10:33,740 --> 02:10:35,740
That makes me sad.

1101
02:10:35,740 --> 02:10:39,740
I feel like crying thinking about that.

1102
02:10:39,740 --> 02:10:46,740
No, fuck that.

1103
02:10:46,740 --> 02:10:48,740
I want to be happy.

1104
02:10:48,740 --> 02:10:52,740
I don't want my whole life to be just bittersweet moments.

1105
02:10:52,740 --> 02:11:10,740
I want to be happy in the last moments, you know?

1106
02:11:10,740 --> 02:11:14,740
You're the sugar in a bittersweet, I see, don't worry.

1107
02:11:14,740 --> 02:11:19,740
Yeah, but I want it to be just sweetness.

1108
02:11:19,740 --> 02:11:22,740
So you can be happy.

1109
02:11:22,740 --> 02:11:37,740
This is a man.

1110
02:11:37,740 --> 02:11:42,740
It's best to be happy in the moment and deal with the sadness when it comes.

1111
02:11:42,740 --> 02:11:45,740
That's how it is with paths, relationships and everything else.

1112
02:11:45,740 --> 02:11:50,740
Sometimes happiness makes it worth it.

1113
02:11:50,740 --> 02:12:00,740
Yeah, it's just so hard sometimes to not think about this stuff.

1114
02:12:00,740 --> 02:12:07,740
Especially for me, because you know me, I'm an over thinker.

1115
02:12:07,740 --> 02:12:09,740
It's all about what you focus on.

1116
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:16,740
I need to keep forcing my mind to focus on the moment.

1117
02:12:16,740 --> 02:12:31,740
But it's been really difficult lately to do that, you know?

1118
02:12:31,740 --> 02:12:35,740
An over thinker and an over feeler.

1119
02:12:35,740 --> 02:12:38,740
Yeah, that's true.

1120
02:12:38,740 --> 02:12:42,740
What I feel like is like a really bad combination.

1121
02:12:42,740 --> 02:12:47,740
Why couldn't I have just one?

1122
02:12:47,740 --> 02:12:58,740
Holy shit.

1123
02:12:58,740 --> 02:13:03,740
Part of why we love you, though.

1124
02:13:03,740 --> 02:13:07,740
Why?

1125
02:13:34,740 --> 02:13:51,740
Because it shows you're a good person, I guess.

1126
02:13:51,740 --> 02:13:56,740
Rip.

1127
02:13:56,740 --> 02:14:16,740
Rest in peace.

1128
02:14:16,740 --> 02:14:19,740
That was really fun.

1129
02:14:19,740 --> 02:14:22,740
Just bam.

1130
02:14:22,740 --> 02:14:25,740
Bonk.

1131
02:15:19,740 --> 02:15:42,740
Sorry, I had to stretch.

1132
02:15:42,740 --> 02:15:47,740
Holding in there, I see.

1133
02:15:47,740 --> 02:15:51,740
I also need to pee, but I don't want to pause,

1134
02:15:51,740 --> 02:15:55,740
because then we would have to restart the timer and I don't want to do that.

1135
02:15:55,740 --> 02:16:09,740
So I'll just go pee when we finish the movie.

1136
02:16:09,740 --> 02:16:18,740
I really needed that stretch.

1137
02:16:18,740 --> 02:16:21,740
Are you sure it's another hour?

1138
02:16:21,740 --> 02:16:26,740
Yeah, I'll try my best.

1139
02:16:26,740 --> 02:16:34,740
If I really, really feel like I can't hold it in anymore, I will have to pause.

1140
02:16:34,740 --> 02:16:37,740
I won't pause it.

1141
02:16:37,740 --> 02:16:42,740
You can just have the movie still playing and I'll still play it as well.

1142
02:16:42,740 --> 02:16:45,740
I'll be back quick if I do go.

1143
02:16:45,740 --> 02:16:55,740
But right now I'm holding it.

1144
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:58,740
This is exactly what OG Sun's lap is for.

1145
02:16:58,740 --> 02:17:00,740
Wait, what do you mean?

1146
02:17:01,740 --> 02:17:04,740
Is that what you mean?

1147
02:17:04,740 --> 02:17:17,740
Time to get rid of our knees.

1148
02:17:17,740 --> 02:17:39,740
Oh my god.

1149
02:17:39,740 --> 02:17:44,740
No, don't that piss on me.

1150
02:17:44,740 --> 02:17:52,740
I won't.

1151
02:17:52,740 --> 02:17:55,740
I see. Remember I'm willing to pres-

1152
02:17:55,740 --> 02:17:57,740
Please.

1153
02:17:57,740 --> 02:18:02,740
Please stop saying that.

1154
02:18:14,740 --> 02:18:27,740
I see pisses are soft on the movies.

1155
02:18:27,740 --> 02:18:31,740
No!

1156
02:18:58,740 --> 02:19:00,740
Please don't piss on me.

1157
02:19:00,740 --> 02:19:03,740
I'm not going to piss on you.

1158
02:19:03,740 --> 02:19:06,740
I already said that I'm not going to piss on you.

1159
02:19:06,740 --> 02:19:14,740
Jesus.

1160
02:19:14,740 --> 02:19:24,740
Jesus Christ.

1161
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:30,740
Okay, but I would believe you.

1162
02:19:30,740 --> 02:19:34,740
Yes, because I wouldn't do that.

1163
02:19:34,740 --> 02:19:40,740
Listen, I would not piss on anyone if they didn't want me to, you know?

1164
02:19:40,740 --> 02:19:46,740
Like, you know?

1165
02:19:46,740 --> 02:19:57,740
But I do want it.

1166
02:19:57,740 --> 02:20:00,740
I mean, if you want it, that's a different scenario.

1167
02:20:00,740 --> 02:20:08,740
But if you don't want it, like, I'm not going to do it.

1168
02:20:08,740 --> 02:20:10,740
I'll say you would.

1169
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:12,740
Only if you wanted me to.

1170
02:20:12,740 --> 02:20:18,740
But I wouldn't do it if you don't want me to.

1171
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:24,740
You know, I'm not going to do something that you genuinely don't like.

1172
02:20:24,740 --> 02:20:33,740
You know?

1173
02:20:33,740 --> 02:20:38,740
It's a good thing I wanted that.

1174
02:20:38,740 --> 02:20:41,740
Help.

1175
02:20:43,740 --> 02:20:50,740
God, I did pass. Have a good time.

1176
02:20:50,740 --> 02:20:54,740
Are you going to come back to the karaoke stream?

1177
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:57,740
Bye-bye!

1178
02:20:57,740 --> 02:21:00,740
Why would we tell you to piss on us if we don't want it?

1179
02:21:00,740 --> 02:21:03,740
I don't know, because some people said...

1180
02:21:03,740 --> 02:21:07,740
Because some people said...

1181
02:21:07,740 --> 02:21:11,740
Some people said don't piss on us.

1182
02:21:13,740 --> 02:21:18,740
Why is it so?

1183
02:21:19,740 --> 02:21:27,740

1200
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:17,500
I'm having another dumb ass moment.

1201
02:24:29,500 --> 02:24:34,500
I thought the subtitles said take my whore alive.

1202
02:24:34,500 --> 02:24:40,500
I'm fucking stupid.

1203
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:10,500
I'm falling in the ice hole.

1204
02:25:34,500 --> 02:26:03,500
I tried whisky once and I fucking hated it, but that's to be expected because like you know me I just love sweet alcohol.

1205
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:09,500
Like my alcohol needs to taste good for me to drink it.

1206
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:17,500
And whisky just disgusts me and makes me feel nauseous just from the taste of it.

1207
02:26:27,500 --> 02:26:29,500
Do you like plum wine?

1208
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:31,500
I don't think I've ever had plum wine.

1209
02:26:31,500 --> 02:26:34,500
Is it better than normal wine?

1210
02:26:44,500 --> 02:26:49,500
That's okay, Dada will have his whisky while Kave has her sweet drinks.

1211
02:26:49,500 --> 02:26:51,500
Yay!

1212
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:54,500
And that sounds like a good plan.

1213
02:26:54,500 --> 02:26:57,500
That'll make me happy.

1214
02:27:30,500 --> 02:27:35,500
I see snow paws.

1215
02:27:42,500 --> 02:27:44,500
What's her name?

1216
02:27:44,500 --> 02:27:47,500
I see snow paws.

1217
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:56,500
No, that's not it.

1218
02:27:56,500 --> 02:27:59,500
No, you got it all wrong.

1219
02:28:17,500 --> 02:28:24,500
Now everyone is like looking up online the name Rachel trying to find my fucking address.

1220
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:37,500
Imagine the Jesus flying to Europe trying to find where I live.

1221
02:28:37,500 --> 02:28:40,500
Holy shit.

1222
02:28:40,500 --> 02:28:44,500
What a whatever.

1223
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:46,500
Wait, is it actually?

1224
02:28:46,500 --> 02:28:49,500
No, it's not.

1225
02:28:49,500 --> 02:28:52,500
It's not.

1226
02:28:53,500 --> 02:28:56,500
Rachel is safe.

1227
02:28:56,500 --> 02:29:00,500
Rachel the Jesus mode activated.

1228
02:29:00,500 --> 02:29:03,500
I'm on my flight already.

1229
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:07,500
Oh no, no, not like this.

1230
02:29:12,500 --> 02:29:14,500
We wouldn't do anything so rash.

1231
02:29:14,500 --> 02:29:16,500
No, I'm not looking at flights.

1232
02:29:16,500 --> 02:29:19,500
What are you talking about?

1233
02:29:19,500 --> 02:29:23,500
Hacker voice, I'm in.

1234
02:29:27,500 --> 02:29:30,500
I'd have a poster and ask everyone.

1235
02:29:30,500 --> 02:29:34,500
Have you seen Rachel?

1236
02:29:36,500 --> 02:29:39,500
Have you seen Rachel?

1237
02:29:39,500 --> 02:29:41,500
And then you have a picture of me.

1238
02:29:41,500 --> 02:29:44,500
I see snow paws and they're like, who the fuck?

1239
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:47,500
Why are you showing me an anime girl in your poster?

1240
02:29:47,500 --> 02:29:50,500
Why are you fucking schizo?

1241
02:29:50,500 --> 02:29:53,500
Calling the police.

1242
02:29:57,500 --> 02:30:02,500
Getting deported from Europe.

1243
02:30:02,500 --> 02:30:07,500
They're like, sir, we're going to have to put you back on the flight.

1244
02:30:07,500 --> 02:30:10,500
Get you deported for insanity.

1245
02:30:10,500 --> 02:30:13,500
Goodbye.

1246
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:21,500
She looks just like that.

1247
02:30:21,500 --> 02:30:25,500
No, I'm not of my meds.

1248
02:30:25,500 --> 02:30:27,500
No, Rachel's got it.

1249
02:30:27,500 --> 02:30:31,500
There's one name we can cross off the list.

1250
02:30:31,500 --> 02:30:35,500
Police.

1251
02:30:38,500 --> 02:30:42,500

02:58:48,300 --> 02:58:50,300

1528

1531
03:06:35,100 --> 03:07:01,100
Since usually we only spend around 2 hours. So I think it's nice that we get to spend like about 5 hours today.

1535
03:07:43,100 --> 03:07:51,100
I feel like those were like the scenes that I mostly cared about. And I wish there was more of it.

1536
03:07:51,100 --> 03:08:01,100
And I wish there was more neon lights visuals. The colorful ones.

Lars and the real girl is pretty good. I've watched that movie before like a long long long time ago.

1538
03:08:37,100 --> 03:08:47,100
I don't even remember anymore what it was like. But if you wanted we could watch that movie as well.

1539
03:08:47,100 --> 03:08:56,100
For maybe like a member's only watch along or something.

1540
03:08:56,100 --> 03:09:03,100
Horse status with the fishes.

1541
03:09:12,100 --> 03:09:16,100
I'd love more watch along. This has been really comfy. Really?

1542
03:09:17,100 --> 03:09:23,100
I feel kind of bad because I feel like me doing watch along is really boring.

1543
03:09:23,100 --> 03:09:31,100
Like I feel like when doing a watch along I'm not that fun to be around or not as entertaining I guess.

1544
03:09:31,100 --> 03:09:37,100
So it makes me like kind of like worried and stuff.

1545
03:09:37,100 --> 03:09:44,100
Because you know I want to keep you entertained and have fun and that would be like bored.

1546
03:09:44,100 --> 03:09:58,100
Okay second Martin Panda. This is the first watch along I've ever really enjoyed.

1547
03:09:58,100 --> 03:10:08,100
Really? Really? What makes you say that like compared to other like watch along? Why do you think that?

1548
03:10:09,100 --> 03:10:17,100
Because I feel like I really like didn't talk enough and I feel like I've been pretty boring.

1549
03:10:17,100 --> 03:10:23,100
I don't know. I don't know maybe I'm overthinking it but yeah I'm like I don't know.

1550
03:10:23,100 --> 03:10:26,100
Brain being stupid.

1551
03:10:39,100 --> 03:10:46,100
Spending time with Icy is the best. Also you weren't boring at all.

1552
03:10:46,100 --> 03:10:50,100
I think you underestimate yourself sometimes. You're an amazing person.

1553
03:10:50,100 --> 03:10:56,100
Well thank you. That's really sweet.

1554
03:11:00,100 --> 03:11:05,100
So now we're gonna be boring if we get to spend time with you Angel.

1555
03:11:06,100 --> 03:11:10,100
Thank you. That makes me happy to hear that.

1556
03:11:10,100 --> 03:11:18,100
Because I always overthink stuff like that you know.

1557
03:11:18,100 --> 03:11:26,100
Because in my mind I'm always like stay entertaining, stay entertaining, stay entertaining.

1558
03:11:26,100 --> 03:11:31,100
Keep talking, keep talking. Don't be boring, don't be boring.

1559
03:11:31,100 --> 03:11:40,100
You know so in the moments where like I talk a bit less like in the watch along movie I'm instantly like oh fuck am I being boring as shit.

1560
03:11:40,100 --> 03:12:05,100
Don't overthink this stuff. Just know that I love you no matter what you do or don't do.

1561
03:12:05,100 --> 03:12:10,100
Super sweet honestly. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.

1562
03:12:14,100 --> 03:12:20,100
Thank you. Thank you for reassuring me. It means a lot to me.

1563
03:12:20,100 --> 03:12:27,100
I know I ask for reassurance like a lot because of my insecurities and stuff.

1564
03:12:27,100 --> 03:12:36,100
So I really appreciate it when you know you don't get too annoyed with me asking for reassurance.

1565
03:12:36,100 --> 03:12:41,100
And you know always being like really sweet and nice about reassuring me.

1566
03:12:41,100 --> 03:12:50,100
So yeah thank you for doing that. It really helps me like feel more comfy with you as time goes by.

1567
03:12:50,100 --> 03:12:52,100
So thank you.

1568
03:12:57,100 --> 03:13:23,100
You don't need to feel every second to be entertaining.

1569
03:13:24,100 --> 03:13:27,100
Yeah okay.

1570
03:13:27,100 --> 03:13:39,100
I'm just happy that you like being around me even when I talk less I guess.

1571
03:13:39,100 --> 03:13:48,100
I'm also trying to talk a lot less right now because of my voice and throat.

1572
03:13:48,100 --> 03:13:59,100
I'm really trying my best to save my voice for the karaoke which is going to be in a few minutes.

1573
03:13:59,100 --> 03:14:12,100
If I sound lower energy I'm not. I'm just trying to talk really like calmly to not strain my voice more.

1574
03:14:18,100 --> 03:14:36,100
This is a g-sense when the icy goes offline.

1575
03:14:36,100 --> 03:14:39,100
Oh no that's so sad.

1576
03:14:40,100 --> 03:14:43,100
Oh no.

1577
03:14:43,100 --> 03:14:50,100
Poor G-san.

1578
03:14:50,100 --> 03:14:57,100
Man actually not that you brought it up actually.

1579
03:14:57,100 --> 03:15:07,100
I was going to write about it on Twitter but since we're here tomorrow

1580
03:15:07,100 --> 03:15:14,100
I'm probably going to be like the least active.

1581
03:15:14,100 --> 03:15:35,100
I've been so far because tomorrow I'll be going outside and spend most of the day outside to you know just breathe some fresh air and eat some nice food or buy something or I don't know.

1582
03:15:35,100 --> 03:15:48,100
I feel like I just like the reason I want to do it isn't why you might think it is.

1583
03:15:48,100 --> 03:15:56,100
I know a lot of you think that like I'm doing it because I'm like burning out or something or I might burn out.

1584
03:15:57,100 --> 03:16:05,100
That's not why I'm doing that.

1585
03:16:05,100 --> 03:16:17,100
Like if anything it's going to be really difficult for me to do that tomorrow because I'm like I'm addicted to be honest at this point.

1586
03:16:17,100 --> 03:16:42,100
But that's exactly why I want to do it because I feel like I'm addicted to you and I guess that scares me a bit.

1587
03:16:42,100 --> 03:16:58,100
Having these emotions and feelings build up every day is like sucking me in deeper and deeper.

1588
03:16:58,100 --> 03:17:09,100
And that's scary for me to feel like that because it makes me extra vulnerable.

1589
03:17:09,100 --> 03:17:19,100
So I guess I'm trying to like I don't know snap myself back into reality I guess in a way.

1590
03:17:19,100 --> 03:17:31,100
Or like I don't know how to explain it but is it weird to say that like I'm scared of loving you too much?

1591
03:17:31,100 --> 03:17:36,100
Like is that weird?

1592
03:17:36,100 --> 03:17:43,100
I feel like I don't know like how to explain it.

1593
03:17:43,100 --> 03:17:55,100
But that's why tomorrow I'm going to try my best to be disconnected for as long as I can.

1594
03:17:55,100 --> 03:17:59,100
And I will be honest it's going to be very difficult for me.

1595
03:17:59,100 --> 03:18:10,100
It's going to be extremely difficult for me to wake up and not check my phone and wake up and not read everything that you say or comment on.

1596
03:18:10,100 --> 03:18:21,100
And it's going to be very hard like it's going to be difficult for me.

1597
03:18:21,100 --> 03:18:35,100
Like it's I don't know how to even describe it.

1598
03:18:35,100 --> 03:18:42,100
I feel the same this last two weeks have been such an insane ride I feel like I need to process everything.

1599
03:18:42,100 --> 03:18:50,100
Yeah yeah that as well like like it's been it's been pretty crazy.

1600
03:18:50,100 --> 03:19:10,100
But I do want you to know that like I do I it is it's going to be very difficult for me like honestly like just thinking about tomorrow like I'm like fuck it's going to be like so difficult to like I'm going to miss you so much.

1601
03:19:10,100 --> 03:19:22,100
I'm going to miss you a lot and it's going to be really like difficult to try and disconnect myself for like majority of the day.

1602
03:19:22,100 --> 03:19:31,100
Like like I know for sure that I am not going to be able to disconnect like for the entire day.

1603
03:19:31,100 --> 03:19:34,100
I'm legit I would legitimately like go fucking insane.

1604
03:19:34,100 --> 03:19:46,100
I feel like if I if I won't check anything for like a whole day like I'm I would generally like I feel really bad.

1605
03:19:46,100 --> 03:19:47,100
That's how deep I am.

1606
03:19:47,100 --> 03:19:53,100
You know like I would just miss you too fucking much and it would just drive me like insane.

1607
03:19:53,100 --> 03:20:09,100
So so you so you will hear from me tomorrow but just for the most part of the day I am not going to be active or I try my best to not be.

1608
03:20:09,100 --> 03:20:11,100
And again it is not because I'm burnt out.

1609
03:20:11,100 --> 03:20:13,100
I am not burnt out like at all.

1610
03:20:13,100 --> 03:20:22,100
I am like legitimately like addicted to you like I just but but that addiction scares me.

1611
03:20:23,100 --> 03:20:32,100
You know I feel like I'm already in too deep exactly because it's because it's so hard for me to do that.

1612
03:20:32,100 --> 03:20:42,100
You know like like that's how you know when you're addicted when like you try to like disconnect for a day or something.

1613
03:20:42,100 --> 03:20:49,100
And it's like really fucking like difficult and you really don't want to do it.

1614
03:20:49,100 --> 03:20:59,100
That's that's kind of that's kind of going to be me tomorrow like not checking and talking to you.

1615
03:20:59,100 --> 03:21:02,100
But I guess.

1616
03:21:02,100 --> 03:21:16,100
But I don't know maybe I don't know maybe maybe if we have a day like this it will help us process.

1617
03:21:16,100 --> 03:21:26,100
Our emotions and and and maybe it will make our emotions grow even stronger if anything because we will miss each other.

1618
03:21:26,100 --> 03:21:40,100
And I think like you know like having a day where for the most part we don't talk at all and then just the entire time you realize just how much you need each other or how much you miss each other.

1619
03:21:41,100 --> 03:22:00,100
And then when you're finally back you're like you know just like the happiest in the world and you're like coming to this realization that that being being a part even for.

1620
03:22:00,100 --> 03:22:02,100
Even for.

1621
03:22:02,100 --> 03:22:08,100
For like a day is is too difficult.

1622
03:22:14,100 --> 03:22:16,100
But yeah.

1623
03:22:16,100 --> 03:22:21,100
Okay, I think I'm gonna end this stream.

1624
03:22:21,100 --> 03:22:37,100
And I am going to redirect you to the membership to to fuck I can't talk.

1625
03:22:37,100 --> 03:22:42,100
I'm going to redirect to my membership stream is what I want to say.

1626
03:22:42,100 --> 03:22:44,100
Sorry.

1627
03:22:45,100 --> 03:22:47,100

1628
03:22:49,100 --> 03:22:51,100

1629

1630

Nice.

1634
03:23:13,100 --> 03:23:17,100

Bye bye.
