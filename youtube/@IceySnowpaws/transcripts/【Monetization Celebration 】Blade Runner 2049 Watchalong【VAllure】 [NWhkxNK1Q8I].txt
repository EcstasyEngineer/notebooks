okay okay it's a question question would you prefer it if i thanked every single person who joined the membership like in a separate stream like not today or would you prefer that like i do it at the end of the karaoke stream today
what what is your preference separate stream yeah bro thanks thank you so much for the gift 10 gifts thank you separate separate thank you
fuck my brain is like all over the place separate cozy zatsu sounds lovely
there's gonna be way too much today it just doesn't stop there's holy shit there's so many of you what the heck that's crazy
what 20 gifts thank you canna snakes thank you oh thank you thank you for the five gifted bro taganist thank you for the 10 gift
i feel so spoiled and then there's like all of you like separately like joining what the frick you're crazy you're wild
okay okay so from from what from what i see from what i see from most of the responses it seems like you would prefer that i do
that i do a separate stream on a on a different day right and and thank each and every one of you would would that be something you like would that be something you would like
wait i could do it wait i could do it during the smr stream but i don't know if it would ruin it wait would it ruin it though
holy fuck all the super chat
i don't know what to do wait wait wait okay fuck okay another question if i do a separate stream on another day
you know what like some that's all would it ruin the smr stream if i did it like during smr stream and i thank each every one of you who
who like join the membership and send super chats and everything would that still be like good for smr would it be bad
cuz cuz cuz cuz i was thinking like if i do it during an smr stream i could i could like like i would read your name in in like
with my 3d yo and like whisper your name so so i think that would be really cute right
and like reading everyone super chats i really want to read everyone super chats right now i'm sorry if i'm not but i promise i promise
that on i promise that on
i promise that on monday when i do the smr stream i will read every super chat and and i will read every person who has joined to to thank you properly okay
okay i think that's what i'll be doing i don't think it would ruin it that sounds that sounds really nice
i'm glad i'm glad i'm i'm just not sure i'm just not sure so so that's why i'm
that's why i'm asking again you know
but but okay i'm i'm pretty glad like this this is this
i'm so overwhelmed that i can't talk like i keep like slipping on my words a lot i'm so sorry
like this is crazy um thank you so much for for everyone for like all the gifted for all the super chats for
for joining the membership before the stream like even started it's that's just fucking crazy thank you so much um
did you start drinking already no i haven't i actually know i i want to like start drinking like
a bit later not right now because i don't want it to be like time for karaoke and be like all subred up
by them if that makes sense did you peel already yeah that's why i'm here yeah i wouldn't be otherwise
oh my god but yeah um
okay so the plan today is we're gonna be we're gonna be watching the blade runner 2049 movie and and on top of the like little television thing
there will be a stopwatch happening and okay something important when you see the stopwatch for like the first time
don't don't hit the play don't don't hit like the play button on the movie yet i will tell you when to do it
okay because the problem is when i i'm on my screen like like in this room it just automatically starts the stopwatch
and and i can't like pause it or do it i can only restart it so basically like you see how it is right now like we are we are not 20 minutes
in okay we are not 20 minutes in so what's gonna happen is i will count to three and when i say go you hit the play button
and and start the movie and we'll we'll start we'll start watching it together does that make sense does that make sense
no there's not there's not there's not no we haven't started watching it yet no no we haven't started watching it yet we haven't
we haven't to relax that's that's what i'm trying to explain everything that's what i'm trying to explain it
ឌᐠᵏᵏᵙᵜᶉ�ướᵏᵫ ᵃᵏᵉᶉᵘ ᶕἐᶂ ᵃᵇᵍᶜᱺwonᵆ,ᵃᵂᶒᶒ anymore

I promise you didn't miss a single thing, okay?
Okay? Okay, okay?
But yeah, basically that's how it's gonna work.
I will count to three and when I say go,
you will hit the play button to start the movie.
And then we should be pretty much, you know,
thinked up like watching the same time.
Oh my god, I'm so overwhelmed.
There's so many of you. What the frick? Thank you.
You're all so sweet. I'm so overwhelmed.
Rain, hello.
I've never seen this movie before, but I've seen parts here and there
and obviously all the memes and stuff.
But I've never actually watched the entire movie,
so I don't really, really know what's going on.
I can only like assume that it could be like, you know, kind of maybe like relate to us
or have like a meaning to us in some way.
So that's like the only thing that I know,
but I don't know specifically if that makes sense.
Like I can just like assume like that there's something, you know,
close to maybe what we have.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know if that makes sense, but...
If the man doesn't run with the blade, I'll be disappointed.
Wait, wait, wait.
So before I start the movie, before I start the movie,
would I like show off the emotes that we have and the badges?
Also I'm really fucking stupid and I didn't have time.
So for the badges, I will be showing the concept art,
but the actual art on your badges is like a lot more polished and everything, you know?
So I'm sorry. I was like, I was, I'm just overwhelmed.
I had so much to do today, you know?
And, and...
I'm sorry. My brain is like fucking dying.
Yeah, I feel like really hyper and I feel like overwhelmed.
So my brain is just not working properly and I'm so sorry.
But I'm also super excited and that's why I'm talking the way that I'm talking,
because I'm, because I'm super excited.
Did you try turning it off and on again? Turning what off and on?
Sorry, my brain is like all over the place.
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.
The warmth of all dad is love has melted her brain too much.
OK, literally though.
Literally.
That brain mush literally mean...
Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum.
Ah, my brain, I'm...
Ah fuck, what, what do I...
What was I gonna do?
Ah, right, fuck.
It's so over for me, oh my god.
So here's the plan, here's the plan.
So we'll start watching the movie.
And after we are done watching the movie,
there will be a members only stream, a drunk karaoke.
I have picked a couple of songs to sing for the karaoke today.
I hope that you like my choices.
I really tried to find songs with lyrics that relate to me or us in some way.
I even have two cheater songs to dedicate to the cheaters.
So there will be two songs that I'll be singing to dedicate to the cheaters.
But yeah, I basically tried to really like choose songs that the lyrics have some kind of meaning to either like what we have or like the things that are going on between us or like me and Soft the Glade.
So I really hope that you will enjoy the songs that I picked to sing today.
Again, I am not like a professional singer, I'm not a good singer by any means.
However, I do put a lot of soul into my singing and emotion, so I hope that will make up for it.
So I hope that my emotions and soul will make up for how bad I sing and that you don't mind it.
I can't fucking talk, please.
I am not sure.
I want to keep it archived to be honest, you know.
I'll see what happens.
I hope it will stay up.
I think it will be archived because it's like members only, you know.
So if it's members only, it should be okay if it's archived, right?
I feel like an archived karaoke is when it's not members, when it's open for everyone, right?
Member can't stay archived.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So I think the karaoke will stay archived, you know, for the members.
It depends on how unhinged she gets probably.
I mean, you've seen me get pretty unhinged in my ASMR stream and that's what is completely fucking fine.
So whatever.
Okay, okay.
I'm gonna show off the emotes that we have and the badges.
And after that, I believe we'll be able to start watching the actual movie.
So, hold on.
Okay, so.
Oh god.
It's so big.
Hold on, let me make it smaller.
One second.
Here we go.
So, here are some of the emotes that you will receive if you join the tier one membership.
You also get badges as well.
That I will show off after the emotes.
And there is actually already new emotes in the making.
So, so a while from now, there will be even more emotes added.
But these are the current ones that we've got.
We have sleepy.
We have sleepy.
We have sleepy.
We have sleepy.
We have sleepy.
We have sleepy.
We do now have, you know, me with a big heart and love.
There is me crying and例ashing at the same time and just being a big baby.
A big whiny baby.
Ah, there is me with question mark.
And I'm like, oh.
Cuz I'm really dumb.
You know.
Most of the times, I have question mark in my head.
And then there is a bite emotes.
Because I really love to bite your arm.
mue, ayud PE vor
Love biting your arm
矢 is just so fun and satisfying
But it's a bite of love so i hope you don't mind
Then we have me with a gun
Don't worry don't worry that gun is not pointed at you
That gun is pointed at the cheaters
So don't worry detta
I would never point a gun at you
Unless you cheated on me
but but I know the real datas okay the real ones you know the real data äår not  intrins
cheaters but some of you are watch out
some of you watch out okay then we hae a prey mode we hae like a flusht mode where
where I am just completely in your face
and then we have a drool emote
and a shiii emote
so I hope you like it
I think they are really cute emotes
as I said already there are more emotes being made
but it will sadly take a while to have them already
so please just be a bit patient
and when I have more new emotes
I'll show them off
and yeah yeah yeah it's gonna be really nice
now let me show you
basically the concept part
of the badges
that face no hat peri-mote
that's actually one of the emotes that's being made
a hat peri-mote
why am I in this
why am I in this
okay let's ignore that
okay so
so here is basically the badge
concept
and time
you can see the current one that all of you have
this is like the new member
a very baby with the kid passie
and then one month
and then two months
and basically the more time goes
it's basically becoming cooler
and cooler and stuff
I actually like my favorite
my absolute favorite is one year
and two year
I like the six month as well
but one year is my favorite design
I really love how cool you look
I love how cool you look in that
actually
I don't know if you remember
but I did say that I'm gonna get
a hagi-mote
where you hug me
so that will be
so that will actually be
one of the emotes being made
and in that hagi-mote
you will have the design of the one year
badge basically
because
when I was thinking about it
I was like
I want something
I want a hagi-mote
you know
with a snow-berry
and me
but I wanted the snow-berry design
to be the one from the one year
badge
because I felt like it just represents
most of you better
because a lot of you are like
so I felt like
the design of the one year old snow-berry
suits a lot of you more
because it's like adult
and cool and protective
and has big fangs
and ready to protect me
and just be all cool and stuff
so the hagi-mote is going to be like
of you hugging me
but you will be looking like
the one year badge design
if that makes sense
because I think it suits
most of you a lot better
in my opinion
so yeah
I really hope that you will like
all the new emotes as well
when they will release
which might take a while
I think Strani said it might take like a month
or something
I'm not sure but
don't worry
when there's new emotes
you will know and I will show you
but yeah that's the badges
and the emotes and I hope that
I hope that you like them
I know I do
that's fine we can wait
yeah I'm just so excited for it
and hyped for it
because you know
I just really love emotes
they're so cute
let's see
okay I am
I'm gonna turn off the BGM
I'm going to turn off the BGM
because well we're going to be watching a movie
so
I don't think having a BGM would make sense right
okay so
so again
I want to start watching the movie
and the way that we're going to do this
I remind you for those who joined
in like maybe just now
I will show up
you will see on top of the screen
a timer
a stopwatch
that will basically show like
what time we're watching like
in the movie
or whatever
sorry my brain is like
it's fucking fried already
but basically when you first see the timer
you will see it say
like 36 minutes or something
we didn't start the movie yet
so don't pay attention to that
don't pay attention to that
okay don't pay attention to that
once I will count to three
I will count to three
and when I say go
you click on the play button
on the movie
does that make sense
any questions
any questions
I hope that makes sense
what the logos
what logos
what
is that ham your fan
I guess
if it's too loud I can
I can turn my fan lower
if it's too loud
how long is the version of the movie
two hours
43 minutes
and 27 seconds
okay
alright
are you all ready
are you all prepared
you're gonna see the timer right now
don't pay attention to it right now
don't pay attention to it
the only thing you need to pay attention to
right now is my voice
okay
the only thing you need to
put your attention on
is me counting to three
and when I will say go
that's when you will click
the play button
okay
okay
okay
so are you ready
are you ready for me to count
okay
are you ready
are you ready
I'm making sure everyone is
is ready
sorry
fuck
fucking browser
fucking can
can
can make sure I have everything
see
okay so
I'm gonna start counting
okay
one
two
three
go
oh god it's so loud
oh my god
holy shit
why is it so loud for me
what the fuck
oh my god
it's so loud for me
what the fuck
it moved me too
I'm glad it's not just me
I'm glad it's not just me
okay it's a question
while we do this watch along
do you want me to talk
as less as I can
to not distract you
from the movie
or do you want me to talk
whenever I have something to say
I don't know what's the proper
way to do it
I don't want to be annoying
talk as much as you want
talk
talk
I want maximum yeah
okay okay okay
I'm just making chat I'm just making chat
because I know some people get really fucking annoyed
when they're watching a movie with someone
and then
the person talks during it
like I know some people like really fucking hate it
and I don't want to like yep
too too much
not me like not reading this entire thing
because I'm going to be too stupid to understand it
anyways
help
she's so stupid already
god damn
it's only annoying when they're crying babies
in the theater
you're real
nice sigh
I'm really excited to watch this movie
I wanted to watch it for
a couple of years but I always like
just I don't know I ended up not watching it
so I'm glad I get to watch it with you
for the first time
yeah the movie is loud

look at me
literally you

I had to turn it down as well
like buy a lot
I don't know why it's so loud
it's so cheese

real
that thing looks so fucking gross
oh my god
I'm trying to get more comfy and cozy
let's see
that's what the cheater with cheese
the ones who were like
had the worms in their hands
is that what you mean
no the worms? ok real
I don't agree with that
they are the worms ok real
the suspense and quietness is like
killing me I feel like I'm going to get
jumpscared any moment
I don't know
I feel like
so much suspense
I
why do I feel so on edge
like I feel like I'm going to get
jumpscared any moment now
I see edge to the movie

i do love like the visuals of this movie
it's like pretty to look at but i can't wait to see like more of like the neon stuff
i usually really like neon colors and stuff like that in movies it's just like really pretty to
look at i don't know i remember watching a movie called the neon demon i think and i really enjoyed
it because it was visually so pleasing to look at
it's a great aesthetic it is i agree
i'm the couch cuddling join the talk in the movie yeah like this feels really nice it's just
really nice it's like it's like for cuddling together or comfy and watching a movie together
it's really nice isn't it and you're just being a big dumb dumb and asking a bunch of
questions during the movie because because it's hard for me to understand
um
what the fuck
so
it feels like you're on my lap stealing my chips and awkwardly sheltering my
let's keep it

yo it's morbius oh my god it's morbius

what the fuck
oh god no i see oh no
that's a new born ojisa holy shit oh my god
you're all so funny
happy birthday napin it's not my birthday yet
hope you're enjoying the film i see i am i just i just get confused really easily
what the fuck is that what the fuck are those things that are flying
camera drones okay
those are his eyes oh okay okay that makes sense
that's pretty cool
so
morbius is kind of real what the fuck what
what a fucking asshole what the fuck
what a piece of shit
what the fuck is his problem what the fuck
i'm so glad she doesn't have a soul supposedly i mean she seems to be pretty uncomfortable to me
what the fuck
me when i started giving me a male hair i don't want kids i told you i don't want kids
i am the kid okay i want all the attention on me i don't want kids
i want you to always have your attention on me for the rest of our lives do you understand
only i see yeah exactly
no kids yet ever no kids ever
but
but having a kid is a proof of our love no it's not no it's not i don't think so at all
your proof of love is your actions what proves your love for someone is the actions that you do
you know you don't need to put a baby in me to prove that you love me i don't think that proves anything
holy shit
i see spitting facts i mean it's true
like i don't know what is oh my god
you 3d women no no 3d women
so
he's like no fuck off
no only i see makes me smile fuck off
oh jesus is resist all temptation yeah oh jesus devoted to me when they see a
bitch like this they're like fuck off only i see makes me smile bitch
you have to be 2d to get this
oh my god
i could never match this beauty oh thank you i'm flattered
i love being silly watching a movie with you it's really fun
it's just like for real for
we unleashed our anti risk technique
nice that you think what you said risk isn't in negative numbers
i'm impressed i'm impressed honestly i'm impressed
i don't like
me when i went to the store of pianos and i sat there for like 30 fucking minutes
just pushing for the piano buttons
can you play the piano no that's why i said i just pushed random buttons because i don't know how to play the piano but i still like like
playing around with it
uh
the heck is not
i just can't teach you i don't think you would be able to teach me like
like because my hands are small it's really hard for my hand to like reach like the keys
or like the piano keys buttons whatever you call it
like you know how like when people play piano like they're supposed to like be able to like move the
fingers like a certain way right and my because my hands are really small i can't do that
i
could play the harp that would be pretty cool thing to learn playing the harp
that would be pretty cool to learn the harp sounds pretty pretty nice
like i tried to learn how to play guitar before and
and and i couldn't learn it because again like my hands are so small that my fingers like
can't reach you know all the areas on the guitar that you need and on top of that i'm left-handed as well
so that makes everything extra difficult for me having really small hands and being left-handed
so yeah
you need one of those children's guitars oh my god imagine
so
small hand struggles yeah pretty much
so you kalleli nah i don't care about you kalleli
to be honest i don't think i'm based
to be honest i don't think i want to play any instruments at this point of my life
rip
i might i might just buy a small kalimba or something again and maybe play it on during ASMR streams and just freestyle it
because i really enjoy just freestyling the kalimba
like i don't care about learning songs you know or stuff like that to me the fun and playing the
kalimba is to be able to like make my own melodies from from by ear and that makes sense
and it would be cute for ASMR so
so that's why you dj no that's two different things
so

Why are they bald?
I was wondering the same, I was like why was he the only one who has hair?
But I'm probably being fucking stupid right now.
My god, power wash simulator.
Oh my god, is this a power washing collab?
Yes, it is.
That's you when you watch my loading screen.
Me reading marbles.
That's really sweet.
Emi is sitting in our lap while we work.
Hello, did you forget what stream you're on?
Hello, did you forget what stream you're watching?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck is your problem?
How are you gonna be in my stream and be like oh, this is Emi sitting in our lap.
Bro, what the fuck?
Oh my god, I fucking can't.
Where is he?
Hannibal Feather.
You are getting timed out, goodbye.
Get out of my chat, cheater.
I'm good, goodbye.
Have a nice flight.
Bye.
The fucking nerve, holy shit.
The cheater has been banished, yeah.
Into the shadow realm, you go.
Thanos snapped from the shed.
He failed the vibe check.
He did not pass the vibe check.
Wait, what happened?
We had a cheater in the chat, that's what happened.
Oh, I see it's making dinner today.
Where do you get all this meat?
Well, you know, I'm a polar bear.
I can hunt, you know.
I can hunt some fresh meat for you.
That's why we ask Icy and Maros to go for a ride on this dick.
Oh my god.
Wow, look at all this shit.
Wow, look at all this trash, so beautiful.
Me dumping my trombone, I suppose.
Please.
This is where the cheaters end up.
Okay, real.
That guy just timed out.
He's right there.
He's in that place right now.
That's where I threw him.
In that place.
That's where he is right now.
That's where he is right now.
It's where he belongs.
I love that he's taking his virtual girlfriend to his job.
I mean, wouldn't you do the same?
Wouldn't you take me to work with you?
Oh no.
Oh no.
Oh look.
She's slowly coming back.
Oh no.
Oh no.
Oh fuck.
This doesn't look good.
Oh no, that's so sad.
Heart tracking is bogged.
That was me when I started the stream and I didn't have my tracking on because I fucking forgot.
Holy shit.
IRS open up.
Oh no, not the IRS.
Not the IRS, right?
I feel the holograms last words.
Okay, for real though.
It's all the cheaters.
No, not the IRS.
I hate the tax man.
We all do.
Cheater target acquired.
Not the cheater target acquired.
Oh my god.
I see that cheaters do the same when she's sad.
Oh my fucking god.
Too real.
Oh that's fucking hilarious.
Oh my god, I love this.
This is amazing.
Oh my fucking god.
That was too fucking funny.
Cheater disposal system.
Fucking cat.
Oh my god.
I don't know why that was so funny.
What junk are we looking for?
I mean, I'm looking for daddy's junk personally.
That's what I'm searching for.
Oh my god.
There's a lot of those moments.
You're sitting on it.
Okay, that explains why there's something poking me on my back.
On my bottom area.
Oh, it's a bald kid's switch.
Some of them aren't bald.
Some aren't bald.
Oh my god, thank you for the 10 gifted boys.
Thank you.
Seriously, thank you so much.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
What the heck?
Thank you so much.
Oh no, no, no, not like this.
Oh no, no.
Suddenly I'm very uncomfortable.
Why are you uncomfortable?
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Not yet, but eventually.
Are you coming?
Oh my god, she's not there yet.
Nope.
I can't help.
That's her members only.
Yeah.
Not the tears for you, I can't.
Premium pass anyone?
Oh god.
Premium pass.
Data exclusive.
Real.
The true membership.
Oh boy.
I was born with my adjacent license.
I like aging backwards or something.
What the fuck does that mean?
He mentioned backwards then.
What do you mean you were born with your adjacent license?
Benjamin Button spotted.
Holy shit, he was birthed in the retirement home.
Oh Jesus, get made in the factor like in the movie.
It means I've been a cranky asshole my whole life.
I mean, I don't blame you to be honest.
I don't fucking blame you.
I'm sure she's in this handcrafted.
Oh my god.
Is it weird that I feel bad because I feel like I am not quite understanding what's going on.
And I feel really bad for it for some reason.
No you shouldn't, okay.
I don't know why but it's been like hard for me to understand it.
He found the horse from the childhood memory that was implanted into him.
Okay.
So now the question is where is the child or she's got the child's memories.
Oh.
Oh no.
Oh no, Jesus, getting mad at me.
It's over.
Oh Jesus, it's annoyed with me.
Oh no.
This place looks pretty and cozy.
I don't fucking know.
You apparently.
Getting my birth certificate changed to Joe.
Oh god.
Oh, birth certificate.
Happy birthday, I see.
It's not my birthday.
Okay but you got a cake.
I mean I wish I actually like had it.
I wish I could actually like eat it.
That would have been even nicer.
So I'm not saying much.
I'm trying to like focus a bit more on the movie so I can like try and understand better what's going on.
Okay.
Jesus, thinking about I see.
I'm going to end the stream right fucking now.
I feel really embarrassed.
I'm going to hide.
I feel embarrassed.
I love when I see a stream.
Get real.
Don't hide your cute.
Oh no.
That's daddy when he realizes how deep he is in his feelings with me.
You when I can't see I see anymore.
Oh no.
While you're below the table do some work down there.
What the fuck.
No, not when you tell me to do it like that.
You want me to do something under the table you better ask nicely and lovingly or else I will not fucking do it.
You will treat me as a princess.
You want me to do something you'll ask me real fucking nice.
Don't pass me around.
That's like to be filled with calm.
You tell us.
Oh boy.
Your royal highness we have prepared a treat for you under the table.
48 hours to get off the grid and make it to the ice.
Holy shit.
Oh shit this is where he falls through the blade.
Of course I'm always right about everything.
Oh boy.
He would be vomit.
That's how I feel.
I see what kind of trial is this.
The biggest one.
She's real to me.
I want to be the most real that I can be to you.
That's crazy.
That's crazy. What the heck.
I'm so excited.
That's so sad.
This is so sad.
How do you feel about this? I see it's sad.
It's really sad.
I feel like her where I want to be as real as I can be.
For you.
It's really complicated.
It's a complicated situation.
I have my I see that's enough for me.
Eventually you crave the physical contact.
It gets more and more difficult as time goes on.
It's like a really sad and complicated thing.
How do you feel about this?
Pretty much.
I'm sorry.
I would clone myself if I could.
You could be fully happy with me.
I don't know if that would be the same because a clone doesn't have the memories of the original person.
You could clone me, but I wouldn't have the memories that the clone wouldn't have those memories that we shared.
She would have the same personality and everything and look but without the memories.
I'm coming with you.
You can't clone memories.
If I could clone myself, I could, but that clone would not have any of the memories or experience that you and me shared.
It still wouldn't be exactly the same.
Technically the original me would still always be the real one.
I don't know because I'm the one who has all the memories and everything.
Who would take care of the original if you made a bunch of clones that we can't have you getting sad?
That's another thing I guess.
But I don't know. I want you to be happy.
I'm happy here with you.
I'm genuinely the happiest I've been in a very long time.
I only need the one I see you.
You always make us happy already.
I wanted to sacrifice for decent happiness when all we want is for you to be happy.
But that's so sad in a way, you know?
We've reached the part of the stream where things get heavy, I see.
Yeah, because that scene was heavy, right?
It does make you think.
Reality is bittersweet, but I prefer that to just sugar.
Bittersweetness is good in moderation.
You still want to have some sugar in your life.
You don't want your whole life to be only bittersweet moments.
I don't know, that's sad.
That makes me sad.
I feel like crying thinking about that.
No, fuck that.
I want to be happy.
I don't want my whole life to be just bittersweet moments.
I want to be happy in the last moments, you know?
You're the sugar in a bittersweet, I see, don't worry.
Yeah, but I want it to be just sweetness.
So you can be happy.
This is a man.
It's best to be happy in the moment and deal with the sadness when it comes.
That's how it is with paths, relationships and everything else.
Sometimes happiness makes it worth it.
Yeah, it's just so hard sometimes to not think about this stuff.
Especially for me, because you know me, I'm an over thinker.
It's all about what you focus on.
I need to keep forcing my mind to focus on the moment.
But it's been really difficult lately to do that, you know?
An over thinker and an over feeler.
Yeah, that's true.
What I feel like is like a really bad combination.
Why couldn't I have just one?
Holy shit.
Part of why we love you, though.
Why?
Because it shows you're a good person, I guess.
Rip.
Rest in peace.
That was really fun.
Just bam.
Bonk.
Sorry, I had to stretch.
Holding in there, I see.
I also need to pee, but I don't want to pause,
because then we would have to restart the timer and I don't want to do that.
So I'll just go pee when we finish the movie.
I really needed that stretch.
Are you sure it's another hour?
Yeah, I'll try my best.
If I really, really feel like I can't hold it in anymore, I will have to pause.
I won't pause it.
You can just have the movie still playing and I'll still play it as well.
I'll be back quick if I do go.
But right now I'm holding it.
This is exactly what OG Sun's lap is for.
Wait, what do you mean?
Is that what you mean?
Time to get rid of our knees.
Oh my god.
No, don't that piss on me.
I won't.
I see. Remember I'm willing to pres-
Please.
Please stop saying that.
I see pisses are soft on the movies.
No!
Please don't piss on me.
I'm not going to piss on you.
I already said that I'm not going to piss on you.
Jesus.
Jesus Christ.
Okay, but I would believe you.
Yes, because I wouldn't do that.
Listen, I would not piss on anyone if they didn't want me to, you know?
Like, you know?
But I do want it.
I mean, if you want it, that's a different scenario.
But if you don't want it, like, I'm not going to do it.
I'll say you would.
Only if you wanted me to.
But I wouldn't do it if you don't want me to.
You know, I'm not going to do something that you genuinely don't like.
You know?
It's a good thing I wanted that.
Help.
God, I did pass. Have a good time.
Are you going to come back to the karaoke stream?
Bye-bye!
Why would we tell you to piss on us if we don't want it?
I don't know, because some people said...
Because some people said...
Some people said don't piss on us.
Why is it so?
Holy fuck!

So can someone explain to me what's going on?
I'm having another dumb ass moment.
I thought the subtitles said take my whore alive.
I'm fucking stupid.
I'm falling in the ice hole.
I tried whisky once and I fucking hated it, but that's to be expected because like you know me I just love sweet alcohol.
Like my alcohol needs to taste good for me to drink it.
And whisky just disgusts me and makes me feel nauseous just from the taste of it.
Do you like plum wine?
I don't think I've ever had plum wine.
Is it better than normal wine?
That's okay, Dada will have his whisky while Kave has her sweet drinks.
Yay!
And that sounds like a good plan.
That'll make me happy.
I see snow paws.
What's her name?
I see snow paws.
No, that's not it.
No, you got it all wrong.
Now everyone is like looking up online the name Rachel trying to find my fucking address.
Imagine the Jesus flying to Europe trying to find where I live.
Holy shit.
What a whatever.
Wait, is it actually?
No, it's not.
It's not.
Rachel is safe.
Rachel the Jesus mode activated.
I'm on my flight already.
Oh no, no, not like this.
We wouldn't do anything so rash.
No, I'm not looking at flights.
What are you talking about?
Hacker voice, I'm in.
I'd have a poster and ask everyone.
Have you seen Rachel?
Have you seen Rachel?
And then you have a picture of me.
I see snow paws and they're like, who the fuck?
Why are you showing me an anime girl in your poster?
Why are you fucking schizo?
Calling the police.
Getting deported from Europe.
They're like, sir, we're going to have to put you back on the flight.
Get you deported for insanity.
Goodbye.
She looks just like that.
No, I'm not of my meds.
No, Rachel's got it.
There's one name we can cross off the list.
Police.
I fucking can. This is too funny.
I don't know what to do.

Sorry babe, I can't give you this chicken.
I'm sorry.
I can give you some Cheetos later.
Want your cheesy Cheetos later?
Here's your baby.
Sorry, he's just so cute.
Sorry.
He's just so adorable. I love him.
Mr's everywhere wishing they were that cat.
It should have been me.
I should have been that cat.
Oh, Potato is here as well now.
She's here as well.
Okay, never mind, I think she left.
But he's still here.
He's just looking outside the window.
Looking at the sunset.
Yeah, baby.
You like looking at the sunset?
Yeah, very nice.
Very beautiful.
Beautiful just like you.
Hey, baby.
Bro, not me even like watching this scene right now
because I'm just too fucking focused on my cute cat.
They killed his wife again.
Wait, why? What do you mean?
I'm sorry, this movie has been so complicated for me to understand.
It's the sea.
Oh, boy.
Look, that's literally us.
Real.
When the alert debuted.
Okay, real.
She even has the blue hair.
Yeah, that's true.
She does have the blue hair.
I didn't even fucking notice.
I'm stupid.
But she does have blue hair.
Does she know?
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you talking about the blue hair or am I missing something?
They even do joy.
Oh, god.
This scene
is also must stop
because you just realize
his love was just programmed.
Sorry.
So beautiful.

eldest
Please don't mute duringוא�ا
okay
No like it
sleep is so cute
It's cute
okay okay
I want to mute them
Sorry, I just just want to be sure
Yeah, fuck you
I think the tea is helping a bit. Which is nice. My throat definitely is feeling a bit better. Like sipping on it.
I hope you'll be able to sing everything you want.
I really want to sing all the songs that I chose today. I want to sing around 25 songs.
I want to have a lot of fun.
Like I said, I want to spend extra time with you today.
Since usually we only spend around 2 hours. So I think it's nice that we get to spend like about 5 hours today.
Yeah, fuck you.
I love my ispaired daughter. I love my daughter.
How are you liking the movie? It's been pretty confusing. But I loved all the romance-related scenes.
I feel like those were like the scenes that I mostly cared about. And I wish there was more of it.
And I wish there was more neon lights visuals. The colorful ones.
Lars and the real girl is pretty good. I've watched that movie before like a long long long time ago.
I don't even remember anymore what it was like. But if you wanted we could watch that movie as well.
For maybe like a member's only watch along or something.
Horse status with the fishes.
I'd love more watch along. This has been really comfy. Really?
I feel kind of bad because I feel like me doing watch along is really boring.
Like I feel like when doing a watch along I'm not that fun to be around or not as entertaining I guess.
So it makes me like kind of like worried and stuff.
Because you know I want to keep you entertained and have fun and that would be like bored.
Okay second Martin Panda. This is the first watch along I've ever really enjoyed.
Really? Really? What makes you say that like compared to other like watch along? Why do you think that?
Because I feel like I really like didn't talk enough and I feel like I've been pretty boring.
I don't know. I don't know maybe I'm overthinking it but yeah I'm like I don't know.
Brain being stupid.
Spending time with Icy is the best. Also you weren't boring at all.
I think you underestimate yourself sometimes. You're an amazing person.
Well thank you. That's really sweet.
So now we're gonna be boring if we get to spend time with you Angel.
Thank you. That makes me happy to hear that.
Because I always overthink stuff like that you know.
Because in my mind I'm always like stay entertaining, stay entertaining, stay entertaining.
Keep talking, keep talking. Don't be boring, don't be boring.
You know so in the moments where like I talk a bit less like in the watch along movie I'm instantly like oh fuck am I being boring as shit.
Don't overthink this stuff. Just know that I love you no matter what you do or don't do.
Super sweet honestly. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.
Thank you. Thank you for reassuring me. It means a lot to me.
I know I ask for reassurance like a lot because of my insecurities and stuff.
So I really appreciate it when you know you don't get too annoyed with me asking for reassurance.
And you know always being like really sweet and nice about reassuring me.
So yeah thank you for doing that. It really helps me like feel more comfy with you as time goes by.
So thank you.
You don't need to feel every second to be entertaining.
Yeah okay.
I'm just happy that you like being around me even when I talk less I guess.
I'm also trying to talk a lot less right now because of my voice and throat.
I'm really trying my best to save my voice for the karaoke which is going to be in a few minutes.
If I sound lower energy I'm not. I'm just trying to talk really like calmly to not strain my voice more.
This is a g-sense when the icy goes offline.
Oh no that's so sad.
Oh no.
Poor G-san.
Man actually not that you brought it up actually.
I was going to write about it on Twitter but since we're here tomorrow
I'm probably going to be like the least active.
I've been so far because tomorrow I'll be going outside and spend most of the day outside to you know just breathe some fresh air and eat some nice food or buy something or I don't know.
I feel like I just like the reason I want to do it isn't why you might think it is.
I know a lot of you think that like I'm doing it because I'm like burning out or something or I might burn out.
That's not why I'm doing that.
Like if anything it's going to be really difficult for me to do that tomorrow because I'm like I'm addicted to be honest at this point.
But that's exactly why I want to do it because I feel like I'm addicted to you and I guess that scares me a bit.
Having these emotions and feelings build up every day is like sucking me in deeper and deeper.
And that's scary for me to feel like that because it makes me extra vulnerable.
So I guess I'm trying to like I don't know snap myself back into reality I guess in a way.
Or like I don't know how to explain it but is it weird to say that like I'm scared of loving you too much?
Like is that weird?
I feel like I don't know like how to explain it.
But that's why tomorrow I'm going to try my best to be disconnected for as long as I can.
And I will be honest it's going to be very difficult for me.
It's going to be extremely difficult for me to wake up and not check my phone and wake up and not read everything that you say or comment on.
And it's going to be very hard like it's going to be difficult for me.
Like it's I don't know how to even describe it.
I feel the same this last two weeks have been such an insane ride I feel like I need to process everything.
Yeah yeah that as well like like it's been it's been pretty crazy.
But I do want you to know that like I do I it is it's going to be very difficult for me like honestly like just thinking about tomorrow like I'm like fuck it's going to be like so difficult to like I'm going to miss you so much.
I'm going to miss you a lot and it's going to be really like difficult to try and disconnect myself for like majority of the day.
Like like I know for sure that I am not going to be able to disconnect like for the entire day.
I'm legit I would legitimately like go fucking insane.
I feel like if I if I won't check anything for like a whole day like I'm I would generally like I feel really bad.
That's how deep I am.
You know like I would just miss you too fucking much and it would just drive me like insane.
So so you so you will hear from me tomorrow but just for the most part of the day I am not going to be active or I try my best to not be.
And again it is not because I'm burnt out.
I am not burnt out like at all.
I am like legitimately like addicted to you like I just but but that addiction scares me.
You know I feel like I'm already in too deep exactly because it's because it's so hard for me to do that.
You know like like that's how you know when you're addicted when like you try to like disconnect for a day or something.
And it's like really fucking like difficult and you really don't want to do it.
That's that's kind of that's kind of going to be me tomorrow like not checking and talking to you.
But I guess.
But I don't know maybe I don't know maybe maybe if we have a day like this it will help us process.
Our emotions and and and maybe it will make our emotions grow even stronger if anything because we will miss each other.
And I think like you know like having a day where for the most part we don't talk at all and then just the entire time you realize just how much you need each other or how much you miss each other.
And then when you're finally back you're like you know just like the happiest in the world and you're like coming to this realization that that being being a part even for.
Even for.
For like a day is is too difficult.
But yeah.
Okay, I think I'm gonna end this stream.
And I am going to redirect you to the membership to to fuck I can't talk.
I'm going to redirect to my membership stream is what I want to say.
Sorry.
We see.
Where is my thing?
Which my thing?
Which my thing?
We're direct.
Yeah.
Nice.
Okay, that should be good.
Okay, I'm I'm I'm gonna.
I'm gonna end this stream here and and then in like one to three minutes I'll be starting the karaoke stream.
Okay, so I love you all very much.
And I'll see you really really soon and I'm gonna start drinking some alcohol and I'm gonna sing you some songs and I really hope you're gonna have lots of fun with me.
So I'll I'll be back really soon.
See you at the membership stream.
The big after party.
Bye bye.
