32
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hello everyone! How are you guys doing? Hello! Hello to all the Snow Berries! Welcome! Welcome! Hi!

33
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay, can I just be honest, like, even though it's past debut, I'm still feeling pretty nervous right now, so I'm sorry in advance if I'm still going to be a bit awkward and stuff.

34
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It will take me a few streams to kind of get the hold of stuff and, you know, get completely fully comfy, so I hope that's understandable with you guys.

35
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But thank you so much for showing to my 2.0 debut stream. For those who don't know what a 2.0 stream basically, most debuts these days usually don't have enough time for you to really introduce yourself fully.

36
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Actually, we have limited time and yeah, I only had 30 minutes and well, everyone did. Sorry, I don't know why but I'm so nervous. I'm so nervous. I don't know, I'm so nervous.

37
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I feel like I'm even more nervous than during the debut, honestly. I don't know why. I think it's because now that the debut is over, I'm like, I can actually read the chat and see what you guys are saying.

38
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So it's like trying to read everything and trying to like settle in and stuff, so I'm sorry if I'm even more awkward than I was yesterday.

39
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Maybe you should chill out. You know, maybe I should. Maybe I should try doing that.

40
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'll ban anyone trying to be mean. Oh, Amy, you're so sweet. Thank you. Yeah, be careful. Amy is here. She has lots of tricks up her sleeve because of her magic book, so make sure you behave.

41
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Alright, there's...

42
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:36,000
There's just so many things to talk about that I don't even know where to even begin. Like, I'll be honest. I feel like I...

43
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay, so there were two slides yesterday that I didn't show during my debut because I didn't have time for them.

44
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And one of them was actually my interest on hobbies. To be honest, I have more interests than what's shown on the slide, but I can't think of them right now because I'm feeling pretty brain dead.

45
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I took a nap before the stream. I was just so sleepy. I woke up kind of early, but it wasn't enough. I went to sleep around...

46
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I think I went to sleep around 1 or 2 a.m. yesterday, so I was really, really tired. Very, very sleepy. I was so out of it.

47
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That's why I was also wheezing non-stop at the group collab because my brain just dies when I get extremely sleepy.

48
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And I just start being extra dumb and silly, and it just results in me sometimes just laughing for no reason.

49
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Do you have a brain freeze? I do, actually. So if I go non-verbal or I go...

50
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's why. Because I am still nervous and I'm still kind of like... I need to shake off all those feelings.

51
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The wheezes were cute. Thank you. I'm glad you think so.

52
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I was scared. I didn't want to be rude because Strani was talking and then Azora was going to talk about her stuff.

53
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And I tried so hard not to laugh. And my body just kept laughing and laughing.

54
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And I could not stop. It was so hard to physically stop my body from laughing.

55
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And I just couldn't. So it was wrong.

56
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
How are you, Cobb? I'm doing pretty good.

57
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I feel like I need to take a deep breath and slowly relax.

58
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I feel like every time I talk right now, I'm overthinking every single thing that I'm saying right now to the point where I'm saying something.

59
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And at the same time in my brain, I'm like, oh no, what the fuck are you saying? Oh no, you sound so stupid.

60
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh no, shut up. Oh no, this and that. And I'm trying so hard to make my brain stop.

61
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm really overwhelmed. So it will take me a few strings before I can get the groove of things.

62
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So I apologize in advance if I'm really all over the place.

63
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No, I sound so cute right now. Thank you, Yumi. I appreciate it.

64
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Okay, well, I guess let's get started. Before we get started though.

65
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,000
On yesterday's debut, I realized that I didn't really show off my full body.

66
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So I'm kind of wondering if I should do that right now. Would you guys like me to start with that?

67
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Because I feel like I zoomed in on my face, but I didn't really show my full body.

68
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So I don't know if that's something you're interested in seeing.

69
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay, okay, okay. Hold on, let me put myself in front.

70
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Let me put myself over here.

71
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh no, what the hell.

72
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Why am I rotated like this? No.

73
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No, why am I rotated like this? No.

74
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm trying to... Oh fuck.

75
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Okay, well, at least this is not the debut stream, so whatever.

76
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh wow.

77
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh wow.

78
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Okay, so this is... Let me stand up on the desk.

79
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So this is what my full body looks like.

80
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And I actually didn't show you guys yesterday,

81
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
but I can actually take off my shoes as well.

82
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I can take my shoes off. Yay.

83
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I was thinking, you know, we are literally in my room right now,

84
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and we're all hanging out together.

85
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So why would I wear shoes inside my own house, you know?

86
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So I might just take them off.

87
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Here, have a nice once in a lifetime experience for my feet.

88
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I don't have any nail polish or anything like that on my feet.

89
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm just a polar bear.

90
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't care about the stuff.

91
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
However, if you want to do it for me and you're more than welcome,

92
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
that will make it a lot easier on me.

93
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If you want to put nail polish on me, that's fine by me.

94
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And let's zoom in into some other parts.

95
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I know you didn't even get to see my paws, but now you can.

96
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So this is my really nice, juicy size.

97
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And you can see my paws also.

98
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You didn't really get to see that yesterday,

99
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
besides when I was showing the slides and stuff,

100
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
but now you can.

101
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll try to do some streams where I show more of my body

102
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
so that you can actually see my paws and stuff like that

103
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
whenever I'm gaming and stuff like that.

104
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Also, speaking of paws,

105
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I want to do sometimes paw cam streams.

106
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I think that would be pretty funny to see how clumsy I get

107
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
when I try to do things.

108
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Maybe do some paw streams where I try snacks

109
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
or maybe paw streams where I write something cute for you

110
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
or decorate stuff.

111
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't know.

112
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
My brain is kind of all over the place right now, but...

113
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But yeah.

114
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Let me get back in my chair.

115
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Mm-hmm.

116
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Whoops.

117
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Okay.

118
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Okay, that's better.

119
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That's better.

120
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I just noticed her belt is a seat belt from a crashed vehicle.

121
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I wouldn't really say a vehicle more from...

122
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
If you saw the lore from...

123
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Fuck, I can't talk.

124
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
From the plane that crashed.

125
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Also, another thing, I don't know if you guys noticed,

126
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
but my necklace is made of teeth.

127
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And I don't know if you know,

128
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
but those teeth that I have on my necklace

129
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
are actually the teeth from the big beast

130
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
in the lore video that I have defeated.

131
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And basically what happened is

132
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
after that big event happened,

133
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I took the teeth from that beast,

134
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I made them into a necklace

135
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and I put them around my neck

136
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
as a reminder for myself

137
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
that I can defeat the scariest of things

138
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and no matter how scared I can get,

139
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
if I can defeat something as scary and big as that beast,

140
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I can defeat anything that scares me

141
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and push through it.

142
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's kind of the deeper meaning

143
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
that this necklace of teeth has for me

144
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and I've been wearing it ever since then.

145
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Helps remind myself when I'm scared of stuff.

146
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Kind of like yesterday.

147
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I was so nervous yesterday.

148
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I was literally shaking.

149
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
My hands were shaking.

150
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I was trying my best

151
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
not to ever look at the chat

152
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
and just pretend that I was doing another mock stream.

153
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And I was just like...

154
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Let's go through this.

155
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Let's do as best as we can

156
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and just get this over with.

157
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Honestly, it's really nerve-wracking to go first,

158
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
but at the same time it was nice

159
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
when I was done,

160
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
when I was finally done with my debut,

161
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
it was really nice to be able to just sit back

162
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
and relax and watch all my other genmates debut

163
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and eat nice dinner while they're doing their debuts.

164
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm honestly so proud of all of my genmates.

165
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
They're amazing.

166
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Everyone is so talented.

167
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Whenever we were doing the mock streams and stuff,

168
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I was like...

169
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Honestly, I was scared.

170
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I don't know if scared is the right word,

171
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
but I was worried.

172
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I think worried maybe is...

173
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Hold on, let me sit in a more comfy way.

174
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Sorry.

175
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm trying to adjust my stuff

176
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and sit in a more comfy position.

177
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But yeah, so...

178
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
When we were doing the mock streams

179
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and I saw all the mocks of my genmates and stuff,

180
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I was worried.

181
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I was worried because they're all so talented.

182
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
They all have such good ideas

183
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and everything that I was really worried.

184
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I was like, oh no, I go first

185
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
and I'm gonna have the most boring and shitty debut.

186
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So I was making me really worried

187
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and stuff like that.

188
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
They're all so sweet and kind to me

189
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
and reassured me that it is good

190
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and that everything is going to be okay.

191
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
There's really...

192
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
There's really not enough words for me to describe

193
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
just how amazing these girls are.

194
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
They're all so sweet, so supportive.

195
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Also talented.

196
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I really love them

197
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and I appreciate any time

198
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
that they have helped me

199
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
or gave me courage

200
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
or gave me reassurance whenever.

201
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I second yes myself

202
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
but get really insecure

203
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and stuff like that.

204
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But debuts are extremely nerve wracking.

205
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
They definitely are

206
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
because it's supposed to be this big day

207
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
where you want to make a good impression

208
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and you want to do the best that you can.

209
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I tried my best.

210
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I tried to do the best with what I have

211
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
and I hope that it was at least good enough

212
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:09,000
or okay to be enjoyable to watch.

213
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Sorry I keep taking deep breaths.

214
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I talk so much that I forget to breathe in the middle.

215
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So that's why I take deep breaths

216
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
because I'm talking so much that

217
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I forget to breathe in the middle.

218
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh my God.

219
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It was enjoyable.

220
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Thank you.

221
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm really glad to hear that.

222
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
There's going to be a lot of yapping today

223
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
and I hope that's okay with you.

224
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
There's...

225
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Breathe pokey.

226
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Okay Amy.

227
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm gonna do breathing exercises with Amy.

228
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
She's gonna do a guided meditation for me.

229
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Oh my God.

230
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Alright.

231
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So I wanted to go over some of the slides

232
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and some stuff that I didn't have.

233
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
That I didn't have with my slides yesterday.

234
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So as you can already see

235
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
the slide has been here for like the best

236
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
22 minutes of me just yapping

237
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
interesting hobbies.

238
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So DJ.

239
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
As you already probably know from yesterday

240
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I enjoy DJing.

241
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm still very amateur.

242
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm still learning.

243
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But when I tried it for the first time

244
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I just completely fell in love with it.

245
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It was just so fun.

246
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I was like oh my God.

247
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Listening to good music

248
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and do stuff during and after it.

249
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Especially doing transitions between songs.

250
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's just fun for me.

251
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I don't know how to explain it.

252
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I think sometimes it's one of those things

253
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
where you have to try it for yourself

254
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and then you just end up really liking it.

255
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The DJ part was really damn good.

256
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Aw, thank you.

257
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Thank you.

258
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm really glad.

259
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
What made you want to start DJing?

260
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So actually what made me start

261
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
want to try DJing

262
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
is honestly watching other DJ streamers.

263
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I would a lot of times

264
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
just watch the DJs

265
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and some of them had such good vibes.

266
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
They would have so much energy.

267
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
They would have all the pretty lights.

268
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
They would play really good music.

269
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
They would interact with their viewers as well.

270
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I was like that is just so much fun.

271
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You get to play cool music.

272
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You get to just party and go crazy.

273
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And you also get to talk to your viewers

274
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and basically feel in a way like you're partying with them.

275
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And stuff like that.

276
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So for me it was like the more I watched other DJ streamers

277
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
the more I was like wow.

278
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I really want to try to do that.

279
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I want to see if I like it

280
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and maybe do DJ streams sometime in the future

281
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
and I started getting more and more into it

282
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and now it's going to be one of those stuff

283
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
that I would like to do at least once a week.

284
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
If not once a week

285
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
then once every other week and that makes sense.

286
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I don't know. It depends.

287
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I guess it depends on how I'm feeling that week

288
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
because you don't need to have a lot of energy

289
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
and be super hype and stuff.

290
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
If you DJ you can't really be like

291
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
oh hi guys.

292
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah let's DJ.

293
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And then I turn on the music

294
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
and I'm not talking the entire time

295
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
and I'm not interacting with any of you.

296
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Like you know what I mean?

297
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
That would be just so boring.

298
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
At that point why even DJ?

299
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
At that point why even DJ?

300
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I also saw

301
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Emi

302
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
write 3D rave with ICS the DJ please

303
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
and actually that is

304
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
that is actually one of my goals

305
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
one of my biggest goals

306
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
is to one day when we have

307
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
3D models

308
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
is to hopefully

309
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I don't know how possible that would be

310
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
but I say don't let your dreams

311
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
stay dreams you know

312
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
make them a reality

313
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
and one of my biggest dreams and goals

314
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
being here in BLR is

315
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
once we have 3D models

316
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
to eventually have this really really huge event

317
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
where we will have like IRL venue

318
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
where you could come into that venue

319
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
and buy tickets

320
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
and see me and all the other girls

321
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
in 3D interact with you

322
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
while I DJ

323
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
while we all party together

324
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and you will be able to also watch it

325
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
live online as well

326
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
as it happens

327
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
that is my biggest dream

328
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
it would just be so cool you know

329
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I just think it would be so cool

330
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
because right now

331
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
there is like 3D VTuber concerts and stuff

332
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
but I haven't seen anyone do yet

333
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
like a cool party

334
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
with like a DJ

335
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and dancing

336
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
and like that kind of interaction

337
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and I don't know just

338
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
something that

339
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
that's one of my big dreams

340
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I think it would be extremely fun

341
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
also whenever I get 3D in general

342
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
there's just so many things that I want to do

343
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I want to do dancing streams

344
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
because I like to dance

345
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
not professionally

346
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
not professionally or anything

347
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I just enjoy dancing it's fun

348
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
so when I have 3D I would like to do some streams

349
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
where I just dance to like different songs

350
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
or DJ in like a 3D like place

351
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
and explore different worlds

352
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
and I just think

353
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I just think there's so many things

354
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
that you can do when you are 3D you know

355
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
like generally there's

356
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
the options are limitless

357
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
another thing that I would like to do

358
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
another idea that I had

359
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
is we would have like a 3D summer event

360
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
when me and all my gen mates

361
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
we would all be in 3D

362
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
but it would be like a summer event

363
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
so I would play a lot of house music

364
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
for that you know summer vibe

365
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and we would be at like a 3D area

366
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
that would have like a pool

367
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
and look like all exotic and summery

368
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
while I play some music

369
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and we are all in swimsuits

370
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
or bikinis

371
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
and we interact with you

372
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and we party and we have fun

373
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
really another thing that I would

374
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I would really really love to do like

375
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
a 3D pool party

376
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
with music

377
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
so I can't believe how much I've been yapping already

378
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I need to remember to breathe

379
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
ok so

380
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
honestly I don't know

381
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
if I even need to go over it

382
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
like I wrote napping but like

383
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
who cares

384
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
like why did I think it's a good idea to

385
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
to write that like

386
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
ok and

387
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
you like napping I mean ok

388
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
what about

389
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
who cares

390
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I don't know I'm stupid

391
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I was really overwhelmed

392
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
but yeah I like taking naps

393
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and usually I like to take naps before stream

394
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
so that I can wake up feeling more energized

395
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
oh my god

396
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
we enjoy the yap don't worry

397
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
thank you I'm glad to hear that

398
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
where's your favorite place to nap

399
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I mean the bed obviously

400
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I also

401
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
like to cook sometimes

402
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I need to be in the right

403
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
mood for it most of the time though

404
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I'll be honest most of the time I'm not in the mood for cooking

405
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
but when I am I can make some

406
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
pretty good stuff

407
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
yesterday I made

408
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
rice with chicken curry

409
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
and it was so yummy and delicious

410
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I actually wanted to take a picture of that

411
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
but I forgot like

412
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
cause I ate it for lunch

413
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
and that's when I took the nap

414
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I was extremely sleepy

415
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I mean your loading screen has a cooking

416
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
yeah it does so I think it fits pretty well

417
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
hmm

418
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and then next we have

419
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
ASMR

420
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm actually gonna do an ASMR stream

421
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
this week

422
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
and I want you to know

423
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
like in advance

424
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
that

425
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
until I move out

426
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
which is gonna be probably around September

427
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
sadly I can't do anything

428
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
like soundproofing or anything like that

429
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
so

430
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
when I do ASMR streams

431
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
if you ever hear something from outside

432
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
or my neighbors from upstairs

433
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
the 3DO picks up

434
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
them like walking upstairs sometimes

435
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
or doing stuff it's honestly

436
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
insane how it just picks up things from the outside

437
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
it's like next time but

438
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'll try to see if maybe I can put

439
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
like maybe

440
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
thunder or

441
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
maybe rain sounds in the background

442
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
so that you can't

443
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
hear the background noise as much

444
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
basically

445
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I just wanted to give a heads up

446
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
that until around September

447
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
that's my situation, that's my living situation

448
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
and I will still do my very best

449
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
to give you a good ASMR experience

450
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
and make do with what I have

451
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
basically and I hope that you'll enjoy it

452
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I've enjoyed ASMR

453
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
for a very long time

454
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
for years now

455
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
and whenever I found out about it

456
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
that's when I felt those

457
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
those ASMR tingles and

458
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I was like wow what is that feeling

459
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
and the thing is I have experienced ASMR

460
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
before I even knew what ASMR is

461
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
like I would get sometimes

462
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
tingles from certain sounds

463
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
but I never really knew what that sensation is

464
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
or if there's a name for it

465
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
so when I found out about ASMR

466
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I was like wow

467
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
this is exactly the same feeling

468
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
that I got

469
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
back then

470
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and so the more I started listening to ASMR

471
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
the more I was like

472
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
this sounds fun

473
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I think it would be really cool to try making ASMR myself

474
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
and

475
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
try to make sounds

476
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
with different items

477
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
and seeing

478
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
what sounds they make because the cool thing about ASMR

479
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
is that

480
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
sometimes you can find an item

481
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
to make sounds with

482
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
and it can actually produce

483
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
many different sounds more than one

484
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
depending on how you tap it or how you hold it

485
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
or how you play around with it

486
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and that's another thing that I always found cool

487
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
so sometimes I would go to random stores

488
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
and I would literally start tapping different items

489
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
or grab them

490
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
or move them around my ear

491
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
to see if it would make for a good sound

492
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
and stuff

493
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
so yeah

494
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm definitely excited

495
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
to do nice ASMR

496
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
for you

497
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
and I really hope that you will enjoy it

498
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm definitely going to have to

499
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm definitely going to have to

500
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
make my collection bigger and bigger

501
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I want to have an ASMR tingle box

502
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
where I will place

503
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
all the products that I'll be using to make ASMR

504
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
sounds with

505
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
so every time that I stream I can bring my tingle box

506
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
and play around with it

507
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
and make nice sounds with it

508
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
another thing

509
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I know that ASMR also includes

510
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
whispering

511
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and heartbeats

512
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
and sometimes

513
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I also love to give hugs

514
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
so sometimes I will give you a hug

515
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
or a whisper

516
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
or maybe even say something

517
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
in Russian

518
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I think I actually saw a Maro

519
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
asking me if there will be Russian

520
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
in my ASMR

521
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
and the answer is

522
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
during my ASMR streams

523
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
if there's ever a request

524
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
here we speak Russian

525
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
in my ASMR streams I could try

526
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
and do that sometimes

527
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
or take requests

528
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
something dirty

529
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
no

530
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
no Emi

531
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I'm on YouTube

532
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I need to be careful

533
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
you should be careful too

534
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
unless

535
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
you know maybe

536
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
okay listen maybe once we have

537
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
memberships open

538
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
maybe ASMR

539
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
membership ASMR streams

540
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
maybe there

541
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I could get away with a little bit more

542
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
if it's also on archives

543
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I don't know

544
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
YouTube has been

545
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
YouTube has been really weird lately

546
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I'm just trying my best not to get in trouble

547
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
at the moment but

548
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
we'll see what happens

549
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I also like to

550
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
make funny duels sometimes

551
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I don't do that all the much

552
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
but when I do I have a lot of fun with it

553
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
so I'm thinking of maybe doing

554
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
eventually like a stream where

555
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I

556
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
fuck my brain

557
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
oh my god

558
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
where I will

559
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
draw a customized version

560
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
of each

561
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
and every member that joins

562
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
on my membership

563
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
on my membership stream

564
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I think maybe it would be a cute idea

565
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
if like I drew some

566
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
custom snowberries

567
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
for each and every person that joins

568
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
the membership

569
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I don't know why I'm struggling so hard to talk

570
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I really don't

571
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I think it's because I also didn't talk for this long

572
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
in a very long time

573
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
like I really don't talk much

574
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
oh my god

575
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
a doodle stream while you're DJing would be cute

576
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I can't do that

577
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I need to

578
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I need to have focus on the DJing when I DJ

579
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
that wouldn't be

580
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
possible

581
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
but it could be like a separate stream idea

582
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
where sometimes I do these stupid doodles

583
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
streams where I take requests

584
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
and draw the weirdest

585
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
ugliest things that I can

586
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
DJing requires two hands doesn't it

587
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
yeah it does

588
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
the thing is right now I don't even have a DJ deck

589
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
so my skills are not even fully

590
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
unleashed I use virtual

591
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
fuck I can't fucking talk

592
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I use

593
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I use

594
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I use virtual

595
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
virtual

596
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
DJ in order to DJ

597
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
but that means I can really only use

598
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
mainly one hand

599
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and I want to get an actual

600
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
DJ deck so that I can use both my hands

601
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
it will make it easier to mix

602
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
the songs as well in between

603
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
so that is something

604
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
that I would like to get eventually

605
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
so I can improve

606
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I feel like not having a DJ deck

607
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
definitely limits my skills

608
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
or my ability to improve on it

609
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
uh

610
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
virtual DJ that's not what I said

611
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I said virtual DJ

612
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
oh my god

613
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
oh my god

614
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
okay and then

615
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
oh god I'm gonna be here forever

616
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
one hand in DJing

617
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
wait a minute that's not what you think

618
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
no not like that

619
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
no I need to be on focus

620
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I need to be on focus you know why

621
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
because I have had times when like

622
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I was DJing and I would get

623
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
song to the music that I would actually forget to DJ

624
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
and then the song would end and I didn't do like

625
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
a transition to like another song

626
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
and I didn't mix in between so there was like complete silence

627
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
and I was like what the fuck

628
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
so no no no no I need to be fully focused

629
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
on my DJ streams because I don't want that to happen

630
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
it's so it's so embarrassing

631
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I can't help myself some music is just so good

632
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
that I just get very into it

633
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
especially when I drink

634
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
like imagine you listen to good music and you drink

635
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
it's very easy to lose focus

636
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
to lose focus of yourself when you do those things

637
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
and then another thing

638
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
that's in my interest is retro games

639
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I really really love retro games

640
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
it's a big part of my childhood

641
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I will say though retro games

642
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
is not the only stuff that I will be playing

643
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I will have like a game or two

644
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
that is more modern

645
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
or not retro

646
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I like to try all types of different games

647
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and if I think that I will like something I will play it

648
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
but if you do see quite a bit

649
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
of retro games and stuff like that

650
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
some weeks

651
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
that's why because I really love retro games

652
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
and there's

653
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
a lot of games that I would actually like to play

654
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
on stream

655
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
let me see

656
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
actually brought that up

657
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
there it is, here is a big listing

658
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
of some of my all time favorite

659
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
retro games actually

660
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
American McGee's Alice

661
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
it's actually the first game that comes between

662
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
before

663
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
excuse me

664
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
that

665
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
that comes before Alice Madras returns

666
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
and I actually think that this game

667
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
is even better than the second one

668
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
it's one of my all time favorites

669
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Jazz Jack Rabbit 2

670
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
another game that's

671
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
one of my biggest childhood games

672
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Blood Rain

673
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
all of these games here

674
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I would be really happy to play them

675
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
so if you see anything

676
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
that you remember

677
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
or anything that looks like it would be fun

678
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
or you're excited about

679
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
then I hope you will

680
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I hope you will enjoy watching me play those games

681
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I really love the Tomb Raider series

682
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
all of them

683
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
but I will say though that I'm very bad at it

684
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
even in the past

685
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
when I played it as a kid

686
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I was always bad at it

687
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
to the point that I would look for cheats

688
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
to skip certain levels

689
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I'm just so bad at this game I don't know what it is

690
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
but I get lost very easily in games

691
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
very easily and I'm also

692
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I'm also bad at puzzles as well

693
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
so I don't know

694
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I love those games but I'm also too dumb to play them

695
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
that's basically what it is

696
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
and back then in Tomb Raider games

697
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
they didn't have maps

698
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
they didn't have a thing that showed you where to go next

699
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
or what to do so sometimes I would literally

700
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
spend hours and hours just circling

701
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
around the entire place

702
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
and not getting anywhere

703
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
so I was like fuck this shit I'm gonna use a cheat code

704
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
and I'm just gonna skip to the next level

705
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
so I can make progress

706
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
will I love for back seating

707
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
then to help you out

708
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
there's definitely games

709
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
where I would be more than happy

710
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
if you help me and tell me where to go

711
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
or how to solve a puzzle and stuff like that

712
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I'll be honest

713
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I'm not the smartest

714
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I'm not the smartest period

715
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I was gonna make like a sentence

716
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
but I didn't know what to say so I'm just gonna say

717
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
yeah I'm just not the smartest

718
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
to say this

719
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I'm not good at video games but I guess it's also not surprising

720
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I only recently came to the civilization

721
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
also I don't know if you noticed

722
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
but I also have Barbie Explorer

723
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
in my list

724
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
and the reason why it's another favorite for me

725
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
is because that game actually felt a lot like Tomb Raider

726
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
but

727
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
for babies basically

728
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Tomb Raider but Barbie Edition

729
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
that is for

730
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
you know

731
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
for not so smart

732
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
challenged cubs like me

733
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
so that game was a lot easier

734
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
for me to play because

735
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
it was a lot easier obviously

736
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
but it still had a lot of Tomb Raider elements

737
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
so I enjoyed it a lot

738
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
GTA, Vice City

739
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
another really amazing game

740
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
that I love a lot

741
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
definitely one of my favorites, definitely a game I wanna play on stream

742
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I'm definitely excited to

743
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
do GTA Vice City streams

744
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I feel like it would be really funny

745
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
to do them

746
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
and when they showed

747
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
the trailer for the newest

748
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
GTA that's also in Vice City

749
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
but with the high graphics

750
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
and everything that will be available

751
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
either next

752
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I can't remember, I think it's gonna be ready in like

753
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
2 years

754
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I can't remember but the trailer looked so fucking good

755
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
and I'm so excited to play it whenever it does come out

756
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
yeah GTA 6

757
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
GTA 6 is gonna be wild and seeing Vice City

758
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
in almost like high graphics

759
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I was like wow

760
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
look Vice City is looking so freaking good

761
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I'm just so freaking high for it

762
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
it's gonna be amazing

763
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
but until then

764
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
GTA Vice City

765
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
and maybe even GTA San Andreas

766
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
are the 2 GTA games

767
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
that I would really love to play on stream

768
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I think that would be really fun

769
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
lots of stuff to do

770
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
then we also have

771
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
ok so the thing is

772
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
silent hill

773
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
3

774
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I remember getting this game

775
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
and wanting to play it really really badly

776
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
but I was too scared

777
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I remember playing some levels during the day

778
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
to make it as least scary as possible

779
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
and I beat some levels

780
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
but I was too scared

781
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I wonder if I play Silent Hill 3

782
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
on stream with your help

783
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
if maybe that would help me feel less scared

784
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
then maybe it could help me figure out

785
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
where to go

786
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
and how to solve puzzles

787
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
and all that stuff

788
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
cause I wanna like play through all of it

789
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
because it genuinely just looks so good

790
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
and cool but I'm scared

791
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I'm too scared

792
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I need my snowberries

793
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
to help me

794
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
and protect me

795
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
you get to prove your own growth

796
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
yeah I guess we'll see about that

797
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
there's also

798
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
there's also

799
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
there's also another one on this list

800
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Drakan

801
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Order of the Flames

802
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
another really good retro game

803
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
that I remember playing

804
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
but I never got to finish it because I remember

805
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I was kinda near the end

806
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
at least I believe I was but I could never beat the level

807
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
because I think there was a puzzle or something

808
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
and I just could not figure it out

809
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
so I got to play it on stream

810
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
and hopefully actually get to finish the game

811
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
and see the ending

812
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
and you know I just think it will be

813
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
a very very nice experience to play all of these

814
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
childhood games

815
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
with you by my side

816
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
so I can talk about these games and play them

817
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
and have fun also I have the sims

818
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I really want to make a household

819
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
in the sims of me and my gen mates

820
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I think that would make for a really really fun stream

821
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
where it will be

822
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
excuse me

823
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
where it will be all six of us in a household

824
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
doing different things

825
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
definitely want to do that

826
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I'll be honest

827
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I want to play all of these games

828
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
at some point on stream so

829
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
there will obviously be other games that are now listed here

830
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
that I will

831
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
that I will play lakas in a pool and drown us

832
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
in me

833
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I don't think I want to do stuff like that

834
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
not to my beloved friends anyways

835
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
not to my beloved friends

836
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
but I might do it to other people

837
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
depending on what happens

838
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
because the sims

839
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
the sims has an expansion pack

840
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I think with

841
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
celebrities and stuff

842
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
and sometimes when you get very famous

843
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
sometimes you get a stalker

844
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
in your house

845
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I think what will make for a fun content is

846
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
if we lock the stalker in a room

847
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
and then either burn him

848
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
or drown him in the water

849
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
or just like

850
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
figure out some funny things to do

851
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
that stalker me

852
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I hope not

853
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
because your life will be ending very soon

854
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
what's wrong with VLurgers?

855
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
nothing, we are all amazing

856
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
there's nothing wrong with us

857
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
we are perfect

858
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
bruh she's gonna water board us

859
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
let's go

860
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I need to be with the reaper

861
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
yes you do

862
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
sims 1 has very limited interactions

863
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
with the reaper

864
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
we are mentally ill

865
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
but I think it adds to our perfection

866
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
because what is a VTuber without mental illness?

867
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
bland and boring

868
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
that's right

869
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
sorry I don't know why I said that but I mean

870
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
it does add to our personality

871
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
you know

872
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
sorry

873
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
for saying weird things

874
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I don't know what I'm doing

875
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
oh my god

876
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
ok so now that I've

877
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
yapped about some of my favorite games

878
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
let me go to

879
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
oops

880
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
no that's not what I wanted

881
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
ok here we go

882
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
oh god

883
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
here is a list

884
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
of some of my most

885
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
shameless

886
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
vlog

887
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
mistakes were made

888
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
mistakes were made

889
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
don't

890
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
ignore that

891
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
ignore that that did not happen

892
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
you did not see that that was nothing there

893
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
it was a joke guys

894
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I put it there

895
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
and then showed it for one second exactly to get your reaction

896
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
it doesn't mean anything

897
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
anyways

898
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
here is a list of some of my most

899
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
favorite anime

900
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
happy sugar life

901
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
mitsudemoe kanon

902
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
2006

903
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
kurejime dg charat

904
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
ok I will say dg charat

905
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I loved it so much and I'm so sad that

906
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
the original series

907
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
was like

908
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
each episode was just 5 minutes

909
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
because I tried to watch

910
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
other seasons

911
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
where they have full episodes

912
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
but they don't have the same art style

913
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
as the original dg charat

914
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
and so it just didn't hit the same

915
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
so I was like

916
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I was like man that sucks

917
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
because I was enjoying it so much

918
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
and I just love how back then

919
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
they made the funniest expressions

920
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
back then in anime

921
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
one of the stuff that I love about older anime

922
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
is how the art style looked

923
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
and also

924
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
and also how

925
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
the expressions that they drew

926
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I don't know they just have so much life

927
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
they just have so much soul

928
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
they don't make them like that anymore

929
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
then there is akunohana

930
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
there is nana

931
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
ichigo machimato

932
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
definitely an anime

933
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
that I want to do a watch along with

934
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
if you would like to join me

935
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
there is a couple of anime here

936
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
that I really want to do a watch along with you all

937
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I think it would be really nice to

938
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
cozy up and watch some nice anime together

939
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
and this is definitely one of the ones that I would like

940
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
it's just really nice and cozy

941
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
elf and light

942
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
such a good anime

943
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
honestly

944
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
it's weird back then I used to be able to watch

945
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
really

946
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
what's the word

947
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I'm trying to say

948
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
hard to watch

949
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
maybe or

950
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
let's just say

951
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
for me now

952
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I don't know if I would be able to rewatch it

953
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
because I feel like it would just make me cry

954
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
and make me too sad

955
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
but back then I was able to watch stuff like that

956
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
without any problem it's really weird

957
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
it's like I develop emotions

958
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
it's like I develop emotions now

959
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
now that I'm here in civilization

960
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
suddenly I'm feeling emotions

961
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
and I can't watch some stuff that I used to watch

962
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I can't fucking talk

963
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I don't master Cinderella girls

964
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
you 149

965
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
another one I would love to do a watch along with

966
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
another one that I want to do a watch along with

967
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
it's so funny I love it

968
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I don't think I'll do a watch along with that

969
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
the thing for me with Made on Abyss

970
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
it is such a freaking good anime

971
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
but it is too hard breaking for me to

972
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
rewatch it

973
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I remember crying so much watching it

974
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I felt like I'm gonna get into depression

975
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
or something after watching it

976
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I don't want to risk that

977
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
it's just too sad to watch again

978
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
but it is extremely extremely good anime

979
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
the story is very good

980
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
but my heart is just too soft

981
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
to rewatch stuff like that

982
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
as a mankadeyo

983
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
another good anime

984
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
and a huge huge favorite of mine

985
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I just remember so many good memories watching it

986
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I think it would be genuinely so so fun

987
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
school days

988
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
another good anime

989
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
the ending

990
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I love the ending it was so good

991
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
another really good and funny one

992
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
that I used to enjoy a lot

993
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I also remember

994
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
NHK

995
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Yugosl

996
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
another big anime

997
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
that was one of my favorites

998
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I don't know if it sounds cringe

999
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
but welcome to the NHK

1000
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
sorry

1001
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
fuck I can't talk

1002
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I'm talking so much that I feel like I'm eating my words

1003
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
and like I can't talk

1004
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
okay okay

1005
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
okay

1006
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
okay

1007
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
they are being

1008
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
okay

1009
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
so when I watched

1010
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
welcome to the NHK

1011
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I don't know if it's cringe

1012
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
but

1013
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
you know the girl in the anime

1014
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
that he talks to the girl with the short hair

1015
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
that's wearing a white yellow t-shirt

1016
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I can't remember what her name is

1017
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
but I remember watching this anime

1018
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
and being like

1019
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
yeah she saw me

1020
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
one day I'm gonna find a guy just like that

1021
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
and I'm gonna fix

1022
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I'm gonna be just like her

1023
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
and then I'm gonna find someone to fix

1024
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
and then there's like that scene

1025
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
at the end

1026
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
where she's really sad

1027
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
and I think I can't remember

1028
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
but correct me if I'm wrong

1029
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
she is you know really depressed

1030
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
and sad as well

1031
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
and I think she is like about to

1032
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
end her life I think

1033
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
and I was like oh my god that's literally me

1034
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I would like literally watch that episode

1035
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
while I was crying and I was like

1036
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
it's literally me

1037
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
they made this anime about me

1038
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
oh my god

1039
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
yeah um I relate

1040
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I relate it too hard too

1041
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
she's literally me

1042
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
oh my god yeah that was one of those

1043
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
moments where I look back on

1044
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
and I'm kinda cringing

1045
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I can't fix each other

1046
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
you never know we might

1047
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I'm hopeful

1048
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I'm hopeful for the future

1049
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
in the book he fixes her

1050
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
yeah I was like oh my god that's so romantic

1051
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I really wanted him to kiss her

1052
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
in that scene I was like oh my god I hope they kiss

1053
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I hope they kiss

1054
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
it makes each other by being together

1055
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
and then love life

1056
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I love

1057
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
why does that sentence sound so weird to say

1058
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I love love life

1059
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I'm probably overthinking it

1060
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I really love the love life series

1061
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I've watched all the seasons

1062
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I've loved every single one of them

1063
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
and I might go watch along

1064
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
of those as well

1065
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
who is your love life best girl

1066
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
for each generation

1067
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
it's a different girl

1068
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
so for me

1069
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
in the first generation

1070
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
honestly first generation is so good

1071
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
it's hard to pick a favorite

1072
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
but whenever I played the rhythm

1073
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
love life game

1074
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I would always make sure to get

1075
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
the ultra rare cards

1076
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
for Niko's birthday

1077
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
and Allie

1078
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I used to really like Allie because

1079
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
she is part Russian

1080
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
and she loves chocolate a lot

1081
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
and I was like oh my god she is literally me

1082
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
but her personality wasn't really me

1083
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
but because

1084
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
she was part Russian

1085
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
and because

1086
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
she would really love chocolate

1087
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I was like she is literally me

1088
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I think

1089
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I think now I would probably be closer

1090
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I would probably be closer to Niko

1091
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
to be honest

1092
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
but I don't have my sweet moments

1093
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
as well so I would

1094
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I would definitely have to be like a mix between Niko

1095
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
and like another girl

1096
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
but I'm not sure who

1097
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
maybe Rin

1098
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
because I don't know if you ever watched

1099
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
love life but

1100
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
in the first generation

1101
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
there is an episode about Rin

1102
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
where

1103
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
where she really wants to

1104
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
feel girly

1105
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
and cute and she struggles

1106
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
to feel that way

1107
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
and I can't remember

1108
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
in details about the episode but basically

1109
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
she feels like she is not cute enough

1110
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
but she wants to be

1111
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
and I think at some point of the episode

1112
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
she finally gets to wear a really

1113
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
feminine and super cute

1114
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
freely idol dress

1115
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
for one of her performances

1116
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
and that's when she gets extremely happy

1117
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
and she finally feels cute enough

1118
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
and I really

1119
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I really relate it to that

1120
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
episode and to her because

1121
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I would have moments too

1122
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
where I wanted to be

1123
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
extremely cute

1124
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
and I would always worry that

1125
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I'm not cute enough

1126
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I don't know, my personality is not cute enough

1127
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
and yeah

1128
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
and that's the thing, I really love

1129
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
girly stuff

1130
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I really love plushies, I love cute dresses

1131
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
and skirts and all of that stuff

1132
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
and it actually

1133
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
wasn't until later in my life that I started

1134
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
wearing dresses and skirts

1135
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
because

1136
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
in my early life

1137
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I felt like Rin, you know

1138
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I felt like I'm not cute enough to wear dresses

1139
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
or skirts and stuff like that

1140
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
but you know the more time went by

1141
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I started to experiment with

1142
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
wearing dresses and skirts and stuff

1143
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
and now that's pretty much the only thing that I wear

1144
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I don't have

1145
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
any pants or anything

1146
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
when I go outside I always wear either a skirt

1147
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
or a dress when I go outside

1148
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
so yeah I do wear

1149
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
a bunch of cute stuff these days

1150
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
and yeah that's

1151
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
like one of the stuff that made me think about it

1152
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
so I think

1153
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I would probably be like a mix between Rin

1154
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
and Nico

1155
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
also because Rin can be pretty hyper

1156
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
and when I have lots of energy I can get super hyper

1157
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
and extremely silly and dumb and that is

1158
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
a big part of her personality as well

1159
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
and then for

1160
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
the second generation

1161
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
for the second generation of love life

1162
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Ruby

1163
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Ruby is actually my most favorite one

1164
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
because she is extremely shy and insecure

1165
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
and second guesses herself

1166
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
a lot

1167
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
but she wants to do the best

1168
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
to overcome that

1169
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
and as you read

1170
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
her stuff

1171
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
and as time goes by

1172
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
she gains confidence

1173
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
and gets better and better in what she does

1174
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
and it's really nice to see

1175
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
the development

1176
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
like from how she started

1177
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
versus how she

1178
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
what's the word

1179
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I'm trying to think of the word

1180
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I'm trying to say

1181
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
fully develop

1182
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
character development

1183
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
basically she wants

1184
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
from being insecure

1185
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
and shy and second guessing herself

1186
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
to becoming a lot more confident

1187
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
and really shining through

1188
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
and that's how I want to be

1189
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I want to be the same way

1190
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
and whenever I get insecure and when I second guess myself

1191
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I think of Ruby and I remind myself

1192
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
that if she did it I can do the same thing

1193
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
and I can grow as well

1194
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
and yeah

1195
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I really can't wait to see

1196
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
like compare a year from now

1197
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
how much I changed

1198
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I think it would be really funny if a year from now

1199
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
we rewatched this exact stream

1200
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
and see the difference in how I talk

1201
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
and the difference in my manners

1202
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
and the way that I communicate with you guys

1203
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I think that would be really funny

1204
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
to be honest

1205
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
because I think there would be a big difference

1206
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
because right now I'm still like saddling in and shy

1207
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
and overwhelmed and nervous

1208
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
and I have moments where I get insecure

1209
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
or second guess myself

1210
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
but I know that we can all grow with time

1211
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
and improve on this thing

1212
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
so yeah

1213
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
lane

1214
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
another good anime

1215
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
all of the anime here are really good

1216
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I'm just yapping so much that I end up not

1217
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
talking about each and every one of them

1218
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
because I feel like

1219
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I feel like I'm yapping too much

1220
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
and I'm like who cares

1221
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
shut up who asked

1222
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
like while I'm talking about it

1223
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I'm just like who asked

1224
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
who cares

1225
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
why was I talking about this

1226
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
no no we love the app

1227
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
we care

1228
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
we asked

1229
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
you're yapping is good

1230
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
we ask thank you very much

1231
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
thank you

1232
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
that's really sweet

1233
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
thank you for saying all that stuff

1234
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
it's really reassuring

1235
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
and helps me

1236
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
gain a little bit more confidence

1237
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I'm still

1238
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I know I'm like a big confident

1239
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
like brat on twitter

1240
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
and stuff like that

1241
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
but when I get on stream

1242
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I'm like

1243
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I just get all shy

1244
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I don't know why

1245
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I don't know why I'm shy

1246
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
why would I be shy

1247
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
of some OGs that are watching me

1248
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
why would I be shy

1249
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,000
I can't help it

1250
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I'm really nervous

1251
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
yeah

1252
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I wish I was naturally confident

1253
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
from day one I wish I did

1254
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
my 2.0 stream today and I was like

1255
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
hello OGs you're all disgusting

1256
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I don't care about what you say we're gonna be talking about me

1257
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
because that's all that matters

1258
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
and blah blah blah

1259
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
but I don't know I just I

1260
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I can't do that right now

1261
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I'm still

1262
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I'm still

1263
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I'm still trying to

1264
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
get over my shyness

1265
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
yeah

1266
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
now that you said it you know what I think would be funny

1267
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I think it would be really funny if like right now

1268
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
a lot of you enjoy my shyness

1269
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
and awkwardness

1270
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
and then once I get more confident

1271
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
you will be like man I miss the days

1272
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
when I see snow paws was so cute

1273
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
and shy and reserved

1274
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
now she's such a bitch

1275
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
now she's such a fucking brat

1276
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
what happened

1277
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
oh no

1278
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
oh no

1279
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
no

1280
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
gap might

1281
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
maybe

1282
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
no

1283
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
kindness doesn't go away

1284
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
maybe I don't know

1285
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I guess I'm just trying to be

1286
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
my most authentic self

1287
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
there's a sentence

1288
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
that someone once said

1289
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
where it says

1290
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
being your authentic self

1291
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
is your ideal self

1292
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
so whenever I second guess myself

1293
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
or I'm not sure

1294
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
how much to show

1295
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
of myself and stuff like that

1296
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I think of that

1297
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
sentence and I'm like

1298
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
just be authentic

1299
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
just be as authentic as you can be because that is

1300
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
the most best version of yourself

1301
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
so that's what I'm gonna do

1302
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
and that's just what I'm gonna do

1303
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
and what I think is the best thing to do

1304
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
and that's just like naturally how I am

1305
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
that's the thing with me

1306
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I've always been like that

1307
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
people around like new people

1308
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
that I'm still getting to know

1309
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
and

1310
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
just start talking to

1311
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I'm always more shy and reserved

1312
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
but then once you get to know me

1313
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
and I get really comfortable around you

1314
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I just become a man

1315
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
sometimes and I just become extra ready

1316
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
and that's when you will see all of those

1317
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
sides of me shine more

1318
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
this small period of time

1319
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
where I'm feeling still

1320
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
extra shy and stuff

1321
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
so enjoy this shyness

1322
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
while you can I guess

1323
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
so you're saying you need to defrost

1324
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
that's actually a good way to

1325
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
put it I think so

1326
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I think I need to defrost

1327
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
give me a few more streams

1328
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
and you'll probably start to see

1329
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
my other parts

1330
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
start to show

1331
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
more and more

1332
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
honestly I don't really know

1333
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
what else to say regarding my anime taste

1334
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
all I will say is

1335
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
that I will have

1336
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
um

1337
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I will do watch-alongs

1338
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
of some of them and also some

1339
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
that aren't listening here

1340
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
because I think it would be fun

1341
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
but again I also want your honest opinion

1342
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
like for example if we ever do a watch-along

1343
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
and you find it boring

1344
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
and enjoy it

1345
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I would want you to give me feedback

1346
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
and let me know

1347
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
and I just won't do watch-alongs anymore

1348
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
or I'll do them less or something like that

1349
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
because I want to have fun

1350
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
but I also want you to have fun as well

1351
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I want to still hang out together and

1352
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
enjoy each other's company

1353
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
one stream of overcooked 2 would kill the allure

1354
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
okay I agree

1355
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I have played that game before a couple of times

1356
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
and oh my god that game

1357
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
at the start it's kinda manageable

1358
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
but it gets so difficult

1359
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
that my brain just can't handle it and it becomes just complete chaos

1360
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
like I don't even know what I'm doing anymore

1361
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
kinda chaos

1362
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
okay so

1363
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
enough

1364
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
enough with this

1365
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
what was I gonna show

1366
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
there was another slide

1367
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I'm trying to find it

1368
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
sorry

1369
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
where is it

1370
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I already showed this one

1371
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
where is the one I'm looking for

1372
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
no not this one

1373
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
no not this one

1374
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
no not this one

1375
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
professional streamer

1376
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
okay

1377
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
okay

1378
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
okay so

1379
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
before you say anything

1380
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I know I have some

1381
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
really big goals

1382
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
enormous goals

1383
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
to say the least but

1384
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
again

1385
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I'm a believer in

1386
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
the ability

1387
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
for us to reach our dreams and make them

1388
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
a reality even if at first they seem

1389
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
really out of reach

1390
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
and big

1391
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,000
the more time goes the more

1392
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I think it's possible to reach them

1393
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
and continue working towards

1394
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
all of them

1395
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
so my first goal

1396
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
is a youtube play button

1397
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
to get

1398
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
and such a big milestone to reach

1399
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
I think when a few years pass by

1400
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
and I look back on it I would be like wow

1401
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I really did that

1402
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
I actually achieved that

1403
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
that's so cool

1404
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
another goal that I have is the 3D DJ party

1405
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
that I already actually brought up

1406
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
in today's stream I already touched

1407
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
based on that and explained it

1408
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I really want to have a 3D DJ party

1409
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
in an IRL venue

1410
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
where you guys could actually go inside an IRL venue

1411
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
and see us in 3D

1412
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
and dance with us and party with us

1413
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
and interact with us

1414
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I think that would be such a cool concept

1415
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
that's different than the usual

1416
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Vtuber concerts because that's been done

1417
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,000
multiple times but this specific thing

1418
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
hasn't been done yet and I'm really hoping that

1419
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
VLR can be the first

1420
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
place to make that happen

1421
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I just think it would be a really cool thing to do

1422
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
original song

1423
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
is another thing that I'm hoping to achieve

1424
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
now I'm not a singer

1425
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
by any means

1426
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I don't have those amazing singing skills

1427
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
or nothing

1428
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
but again it's one of those things

1429
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
that I really want to

1430
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
write off my bucket list

1431
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
it's one of the things that I want to know

1432
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
that I did at least once in my life

1433
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
really cute and cool to have

1434
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
my own original song made

1435
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
and I don't know I think that would be exciting

1436
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
and really cool

1437
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,000
any ideas for the song

1438
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
as of right now I'll be honest

1439
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
I'm not so sure

1440
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
but I think the more time goes

1441
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
the more I'll probably

1442
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
have more of an idea

1443
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
right now it's more of a general goal

1444
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
I don't really have the details

1445
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
figured out and stuff like that yet

1446
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
another goal of mine

1447
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
is by parents

1448
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
a house or be able

1449
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
to support them enough so that

1450
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
they can retire

1451
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
my parents are both really the most amazing people

1452
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
in the world

1453
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
they've given everything for me and beyond

1454
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
they always made sure

1455
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
to keep me as happy as I can

1456
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
always work extremely hard

1457
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
always been supportive

1458
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
of what I wanted to do

1459
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
always loved me and accepted me

1460
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
the more time goes by

1461
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
the more I'm like

1462
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I just really want them to retire

1463
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
I really want the rest of their lives

1464
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
to be just relaxing

1465
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
and having a good time

1466
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
and not worry about work anymore

1467
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
and get them a nice house

1468
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
where they can be living life

1469
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
because they genuinely deserve it

1470
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
they've given me so much love

1471
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
just so many things

1472
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
to be honest this goal

1473
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
is my number one goal

1474
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
to be honest

1475
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
if I can give that to them one day

1476
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
I'll honestly be the most fulfilled

1477
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
and happy that I can be

1478
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
you know that I can give my parents a better life

1479
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
and give them back

1480
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
for all the insane

1481
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
amount of love and attention and hard work

1482
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
that they've put into me

1483
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I love them very much

1484
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
they actually

1485
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
know that I'm a VTuber and that I stream

1486
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
and they're extremely supportive

1487
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,000
and they're super sweet about it

1488
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
actually whenever I

1489
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
sometimes I would talk with them

1490
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
and video chat with them

1491
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
and so there was this one time when I showed them

1492
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
what I look like

1493
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
in my polar bear form

1494
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
and they were amazed

1495
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
they were like wow it looks just like you

1496
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
they were so excited they got

1497
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
and I also remember when I got

1498
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
the email

1499
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
the big email from VLR

1500
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
for an interview and stuff

1501
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
I told my parents when I finally got accepted

1502
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
and my dad was so happy for me

1503
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
that he started dancing

1504
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
and he almost fell

1505
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I was so sweet and supportive

1506
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
and happy for me

1507
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
it was just super cute and I'm like

1508
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
man I do it for that

1509
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
I also want to adopt

1510
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
many more cats

1511
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
so they can have better life

1512
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
and a forever home

1513
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
I have two cats already but I do want to have more

1514
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
because I really love going to the animal shelter

1515
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
and check

1516
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
on the new cats that I have sometimes

1517
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
and

1518
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
sorry

1519
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
and there's just so many

1520
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
cats in there that are super sweet

1521
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
and nice and

1522
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I just want them to give them a good life

1523
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
I want to know

1524
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
that this cute cat or these cute cats

1525
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
will live their best life

1526
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
that they possibly can experience

1527
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
so that's another thing that I really want to do

1528
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
there's also a lot of

1529
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
such sweet old cats that don't get adopted

1530
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I really want to adopt

1531
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
some old cats as well

1532
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I feel like they really deserve a lot of love

1533
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
and I really want to make sure that the time

1534
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
that they do have left

1535
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
will be spent being the happiest that they can be

1536
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
and then another goal

1537
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
is to appear at cons

1538
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
or meet ups and stuff like that to meet you

1539
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
it's just such a big dream of mine

1540
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I think it would be like honestly

1541
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
the coolest thing ever to actually see all of you

1542
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
and talk to you and say hi to you

1543
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
and I don't know isn't that exciting

1544
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,000
that would be just

1545
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
like you know

1546
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
the coolest thing ever

1547
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
and it's just

1548
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
I don't know there's just something about it

1549
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
that would make me feel really happy

1550
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
and excited to actually get to meet each and one of you

1551
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
and it's just

1552
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
it's just really cool and I hope I get

1553
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
to do that

1554
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,000
I really hope I get to do that someday

1555
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
I think that would be really nice thing

1556
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,000
to do

1557
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
hold on

1558
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
sorry

1559
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000

1560
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000

01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:54,760
Amazing, right? Okay, so let me show you some of the merch.

1653
01:35:54,760 --> 01:36:04,760
We have a cute keychain with an acrylic, me being all EP and cute.

1654
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:07,760
And look at that.

1655
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:20,760
Thank God this is not my official debut, because wow, that would have been like the shittiest debut in all history.

1656
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:28,760
The cute thing about the keychain is that you can basically carry me around anywhere you go.

1657
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:40,760
You go, if you go anywhere, just put me on your back or as a phone charm or wherever and I'll just be there.

1658
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:48,760
Just like pocket, icy snowpies, always there to give you moral support.

1659
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,760
I don't know what I'm saying.

1660
01:36:50,760 --> 01:37:03,760
And then another thing that we have, excuse me, an acrylic stand.

1661
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:11,760
So in those days that you don't go anywhere, if you just want to be home and stay and relax,

1662
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:19,760
and let's say, you know, it's the middle of the night and you're feeling lonely and you miss me and you're like,

1663
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:23,760
man, I miss icy snowpies.

1664
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,760
I wish you was here with me, coddling me.

1665
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,760
Well, do I have the solution for you?

1666
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:39,760
You see this? Just get this acrylic stand of me and put it in your bed, put the cover and

1667
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:44,760
cuddle with me and just go to town.

1668
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:47,760
Do whatever you want with me, you know?

1669
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:50,760
Pleasure all my...

1670
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:54,760
The fuck is my problem?

1671
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,760
What is my problem?

1672
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:03,760
And we also have really cool sweatpants.

1673
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:12,760
So whenever you want to wear something inside your house, but still feel cool and fashionable,

1674
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:17,760
you can get these sweatpants that look really cute and really cool.

1675
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:24,760
They have all of these snow prints on it.

1676
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:31,760
So whenever you walk around the house and someone comes in or you just look in the mirror

1677
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:41,760
and you're like, man, these snow prints, wow, they make me think of icy.

1678
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:49,760
Man, I miss her, but damn, do I look cool with these sweatpants?

1679
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:57,760
Oh my god, I'm so sorry that you're witnessing this.

1680
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,760
I apologize.

1681
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:12,760
And then we also have a really, really cute hoodie with this really, really nice art with me on it.

1682
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:23,760
So if you are the kind of person that loves hoodies and feels comfy in them, well, look at this amazing thing.

1683
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:35,760
It has this beautiful art of me and then on the sides of the arms, it has those eyes.

1684
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:39,760
Not eyes, fuck, I'm stupid, the freaking snowflakes.

1685
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:43,760
The freaking snowflakes, that's the word I was looking for.

1686
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,760
Oh my god, I'm stupid.

1687
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:52,760
It has snowflakes on the arms and if you get it together with the sweatpants, it will be basically like I said.

1688
01:39:52,760 --> 01:40:07,760
However, if a hoodie is in your thing or the weather is getting too hot for a hoodie right now, for most places anyways, you can just get a t-shirt.

1689
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:15,760
Yeah, now that it's getting hotter and it's becoming somewhere, you can just wear a t-shirt as well.

1690
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:29,760
So if you wanna go outside or even wear it inside the house and always have me around or show everyone how cool you are, this t-shirt is definitely for you.

1691
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,760
Definitely recommend.

1692
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:41,760
I really hope that you like all these merch stuff.

1693
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,760
Let me post the link again.

1694
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:49,760
Fuck, what is enough?

1695
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:50,760
Oh, okay.

1696
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:52,760
Oh no, my arm, fuck.

1697
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:56,760
I need to get rid of that.

1698
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:06,760
I keep bringing the other fucking cold ice cones.

1699
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:11,760
I keep bringing up the freaking third arm with ice cones.

1700
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:13,760
I need to get rid of that.

1701
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:17,760
I keep pushing it accidentally.

1702
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:21,760
I just keep pushing it accidentally like a dumbass.

1703
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:24,760
Oh my god, I'm sorry about that.

1704
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:26,760
Hold on.

1705
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:29,760
Let me sit back.

1706
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:31,760
Let me sit, fuck.

1707
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,760
Okay, let me...

1708
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:38,760
Okay, now more comfy.

1709
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:40,760
Nice, nice, nice.

1710
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:45,760
Is that your special merch I see?

1711
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,760
What do you mean by special?

1712
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:56,760
I mean, if there's a merch of me, I mean, all of it is special, right?

1713
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:58,760
Spy Team Fortress 2?

1714
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:01,760
Well, what do you mean?

1715
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:07,760
How could my kusuga be so cute and pun?

1716
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,760
I honestly don't know.

1717
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:12,760
It's just the nature of me, strongy.

1718
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:15,760
That's how I am at first.

1719
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:20,760
And as time goes by, I become more and more ready.

1720
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:24,760
You are special?

1721
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:25,760
Yeah, mentally.

1722
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,760
But thank you.

1723
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:30,760
What are we talking about, chat?

1724
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:33,760
We're talking about my merch.

1725
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,760
Merch?

1726
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:37,760
Yeah!

1727
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:41,760
Man, that was so embarrassing.

1728
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:44,760
Like, what was that?

1729
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:48,760
I think I'm gonna cringe at that for the rest of my life.

1730
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:57,760
I'm really trying to sell stuff to you and all I have to say is merch, yeah.

1731
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:04,760
Well, we know you are, but underneath the bradians...

1732
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:06,760
Wait, I'm a bit confused.

1733
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:08,760
What do you mean by that?

1734
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:11,760
I think you missworded what you were trying to say.

1735
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:15,760
Do we get an icy cup to come pre-filled?

1736
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,760
No.

1737
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,760
Not yet anyways.

1738
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:22,760
I think.

1739
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:24,760
I mean, we'll see what happens, maybe.

1740
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:26,760
Maybe in the future.

1741
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,760
You already sold it to me easy.

1742
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:30,760
Wow, really?

1743
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:33,760
Wow, I'm honestly impressed.

1744
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:37,760
That just that alone would be enough.

1745
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:40,760
It's our thing now.

1746
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:41,760
Merch, yes?

1747
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:42,760
Get your sentence?

1748
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:43,760
Oh, no.

1749
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:57,760
Out of all, like, cool sentences that I could have, like, come up with, or, like, a motto or something, like, that's the best that I have, like, really?

1750
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:06,760
I think they meant underneath your guffinius, your brad.

1751
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:08,760
Yeah, well, it is.

1752
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:15,760
I would say that I can be, like, a bit of a sweet brat.

1753
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,760
I don't know if that makes any sense.

1754
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:23,760
Like, I enjoy being a brat because obviously it's really funny and entertaining for me,

1755
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:28,760
but I have my sweet moments as well, you know?

1756
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:32,760
Don't undersell yourself.

1757
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:42,760
Yeah, I'm trying my best to work on becoming more confident and stuff like that, and that's second guessing myself as much.

1758
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:52,760
Honestly, I would 100% buy a shirt that just says Merch, yeah?

1759
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:54,760
Wow, new Merch idea.

1760
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:56,760
Oh my God, Stroney, look at that.

1761
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:59,760
Here you go, here's the new Merch idea.

1762
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:07,760
Get a t-shirt and have it say Merch, yeah, and a picture of me.

1763
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:12,760
Oh my God, that would be so goofy.

1764
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:25,760
You're Merch missing a hat and shoes, if there are, it'll be full armor.

1765
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,760
Who knows, maybe eventually that would be a thing.

1766
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:31,760
I'm not really sure.

1767
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:35,760
Oh my God, I keep having to clear my throat so much, I'm so sorry.

1768
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:41,760
But yeah, if you notice me muting a lot, it's because I keep having to clear my throat.

1769
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:48,760
I don't think, I don't know the last time I have talked so much, honestly.

1770
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:56,760
I've been yapping for almost two hours non-stop, so I guess that would make sense.

1771
01:45:56,760 --> 01:46:02,760
I just constantly have to clear my throat, I didn't speak that much for such a long time.

1772
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:05,760
Clearing your throat, she just liked me.

1773
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:08,760
It's honestly really annoying, it's so annoying.

1774
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:14,760
I just want to be able to talk and talk non-stop and not have it cut in my way.

1775
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:17,760
At least you're comfortable streaming.

1776
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:24,760
Yeah, the more streams I have, the more comfortable I'm with.

1777
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:29,760
Don't mute yourself, we need every cough.

1778
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:33,760
We just want to hear your sneezes because of that.

1779
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,760
I don't know about that.

1780
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:40,760
I don't know if you want to hear it.

1781
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:44,760
I don't know about that.

1782
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:47,760
I don't know if you want to hear it.

1783
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:50,760
I don't know.

1784
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:56,760
I don't know if you want to hear me clear my throat.

1785
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:59,760
I don't know, that's a very pleasant sound.

1786
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:06,760
Fastest yapper in the west.

1787
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:14,760
That sniffing video was, well, not video short.

1788
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:15,760
It's pretty cute.

1789
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:22,760
Actually, I don't know if I'm allowed to say it, but I hope it's okay.

1790
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:25,760
I don't think it's a bad thing.

1791
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:36,760
There's actually going to be a short meme ASMR video coming up of me sniffing.

1792
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:50,760
I actually noticed that after my short, a lot of people said that they really like when I do the sniffing in ASMR.

1793
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:58,760
So yeah, if you really like sniffing in ASMR, a short video is going to come up.

1794
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:00,760
Oh my god, no graduate right now.

1795
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:02,760
I see you on that sandwich.

1796
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:04,760
Okay, okay, I wasn't sure.

1797
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:09,760
I wasn't sure how much I'm allowed to say or not.

1798
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:18,760
But yeah, if you're into ASMR sniffing out, there will be a short ASMR video coming up with that.

1799
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,760
I don't like sniffing ASMR.

1800
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:23,760
I think it could be pretty nice.

1801
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:33,760
But it's a bit tricky to do because whenever I do it, I'm not sure if I'm doing it too loud or if it sounds good or not.

1802
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:45,760
So I guess you can give me feedback on that when that video is going to be up.

1803
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:47,760
But will you be sniffing though?

1804
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:49,760
You of course!

1805
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,760
Yeah!

1806
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:53,760
Obviously I'm going to be sniffing you.

1807
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,760
Who cares about anything else?

1808
01:48:55,760 --> 01:49:02,760
I want to sniff you and know your nice scent.

1809
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:04,760
Video goes up later today.

1810
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:07,760
Oh, nice! I had no idea. That's awesome.

1811
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,760
Okay, that's good to know.

1812
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:13,760
So see, the sniffing ASMR is actually going to be up later today.

1813
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:16,760
So yeah, thank you for letting me know, Strani.

1814
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:18,760
That's awesome.

1815
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:20,760
Oh, do you sound sniffing?

1816
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:24,760
Yeah, trying to make sure I remember that scent very well.

1817
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:26,760
Oh, do you sound sniffing?

1818
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:32,760
Wait, wait, let me shower first.

1819
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:38,760
Okay, well, time is ticking, so you better get in that shower.

1820
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:51,760
The thing was by TF2 is there's a glitch in the mission where he has three arms, so kind of reference.

1821
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:59,760
I used to play a lot of TF2 in the past.

1822
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,760
And I used to main the heavy.

1823
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:09,760
I don't know if you know why, but his Russian accent.

1824
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:17,760
And because I speak Russian, I thought it would be funny to main him.

1825
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:22,760
Besides that, I also really love his weapon.

1826
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:29,760
I really love the ability to be extra strong in games.

1827
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:33,760
And I love how fast his weapon goes.

1828
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:39,760
Because it just goes just shooting non-stop.

1829
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:44,760
So yeah, I used to main the heavy and it's always been really fun.

1830
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:52,760
Sometimes I would also play as engineer, I think.

1831
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:58,760
Sometimes I would also play as engineer, but yeah, heavy was my main.

1832
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:05,760
Heavy was my main, and I just have such good memories playing TF2.

1833
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:18,760
I wonder if it would be possible to ever play TF2 with you?

1834
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:23,760
I would have to figure that out. How would that work if it was possible?

1835
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:28,760
Because it wouldn't be cool if we played it together or something.

1836
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:34,760
I mean, I'm gonna suck. I haven't played it in a few years.

1837
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:38,760
It's been such a long time, but I think that would be really cool.

1838
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:47,760
So if it was possible and I could figure out a way to make it work, I think that would be cool.

1839
01:51:47,760 --> 01:52:03,760
But regardless of that, I really want to find games that, you know, games where a lot of people can play together, if that makes sense.

1840
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:08,760
I think that would be really fun as well.

1841
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:29,760
I know there's like the usual fall guys and stuff, but if you have any recommendations for multiplayer games that allow quite a bit of people in it, I think that would be really cool if we can do that.

1842
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:37,760
I think that would be fun to meet you in-game and play and do fun stuff.

1843
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:40,760
I think that would be really nice.

1844
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:43,760
Nice quality time together in a way.

1845
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:55,760
I know technically this is our quality time because I'm talking to you right now, but I meant quality time where we actually do stuff together, if that makes sense.

1846
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:59,760
Monster Hunter?

1847
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:03,760
I'm really bad at Monster Hunter.

1848
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:05,760
Like really bad.

1849
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:07,760
Like so bad that...

1850
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:11,760
Man, I'm really bad at games.

1851
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:15,760
Like I feel in group games and stuff like that.

1852
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:19,760
I'm probably just going to hold back.

1853
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,760
Hold everyone down?

1854
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:23,760
Is that how you say it?

1855
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:27,760
I can't forget, there's a way to say it.

1856
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:32,760
Like hold everyone back or hold everyone down.

1857
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:35,760
Just because of how bad I am in games, but...

1858
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:37,760
Oh well.

1859
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:40,760
Minecraft?

1860
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,760
Okay, so...

1861
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:46,760
Okay, Minecraft, so...

1862
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:49,760
Ah...

1863
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:54,760
How do I...

1864
01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:58,760
How do I explain it?

1865
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:06,760
Okay, so Minecraft for me, I will say right now, I don't care about the building part of it.

1866
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:08,760
I just don't care about the building.

1867
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:14,760
If I do build something, it's going to look like a freaking box.

1868
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:16,760
And it's going to look messy.

1869
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:18,760
It's going to look like trash.

1870
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:22,760
I'm the kind of person that if I will play Minecraft,

1871
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:25,760
I will be the person that causes trouble.

1872
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:29,760
I will start throwing explosives everywhere.

1873
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:33,760
I will start punching everyone and run away.

1874
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:38,760
I will want to go exploring and kill monsters.

1875
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:42,760
And collect like cool shiny stuff or like heal.

1876
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:49,760
You know, things are hard to kill, but like team up and stuff like that.

1877
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:56,760
But yeah, like the building aspect of Minecraft is just...

1878
01:54:56,760 --> 01:54:59,760
Not for me, I just...

1879
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:02,760
I just don't care about that part of the game.

1880
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:04,760
I just don't.

1881
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:11,760
I want to like do funny and cool stuff.

1882
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:18,760
Breddy bear blows up a Jason's house with TNT traps.

1883
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:21,760
Yeah, that is something I would definitely do.

1884
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:23,760
Do you like Terraria?

1885
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:26,760
I've played it a bit here and there.

1886
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:32,760
It was a nice game, but I could never like really fully get into it.

1887
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:37,760
Not that I'm like into Minecraft either.

1888
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:45,760
Like for me, I would only play it with my gen mates, you know?

1889
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:51,760
Like when we get like a server and we can play together,

1890
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:54,760
then I would love to play it with them, you know?

1891
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:57,760
But I'm not into like playing it on my own

1892
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:01,760
because that would just be like really boring for me personally.

1893
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:13,760
Sorry, my brain is getting fried.

1894
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:16,760
Hold on, I also want to check something.

1895
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:18,760
I want to check something.

1896
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:29,760
I know that Strani is supposed to stream pretty soon, I think, right?

1897
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:32,760
If I'm correct, let me check.

1898
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:43,760
Oh yeah, she's going to stream in like six minutes.

1899
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:45,760
She's going to stream in like six minutes.

1900
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:50,760
So I wonder if it would be a good idea if I end the stream here

1901
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:53,760
and I redirect you guys to her stream

1902
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:56,760
because honestly, I want to be in that stream

1903
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:00,760
and be in her chat and listen to her

1904
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:02,760
because she's going to have a really fun stream today.

1905
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:06,760
She's going to be exposing via lore.

1906
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:08,760
She's going to be exposing via lore.

1907
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:10,760
Talk about behind the scenes and all that stuff.

1908
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:13,760
So it's going to be super, super fun.

1909
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:19,760
So I think what I should do right now is I'm going to end the stream.

1910
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:22,760
Please, please don't leave, please don't leave.

1911
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:27,760
Once I end the stream, you will automatically be redirected into Strani's stream

1912
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:31,760
and she'll be talking about all behind the scenes,

1913
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:34,760
all the juicy stuff.

1914
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:37,760
And yeah, I think you will really, really enjoy it.

1915
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:40,760
I know I will and I am in VLR.

1916
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:44,760
So we can both hang out in her chat.

1917
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:49,760
So for I leave, I wanted to say thank you, thank you, thank you so much

1918
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:51,760
for showing up to my stream today.

1919
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:56,760
Thank you for hearing me up for two hours.

1920
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:58,760
I had a lot of fun with you.

1921
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:00,760
Thank you for being so sweet to me.

1922
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:03,760
Thank you for all the kind words

1923
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:05,760
and support.

1924
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:10,760
And I will see you again tomorrow at the same time.

1925
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:13,760
I will be playing Tomb Raider Legends,

1926
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:16,760
which is one of my favorite Tomb Raider games.

1927
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:23,760
I will see you tomorrow.

1928
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,760
I'm going to miss you.

1929
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:26,760
Don't miss me too much.

1930
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:28,760
You'll see me again soon.

1931
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:30,760
And let's go.

1932
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:31,760
Let's go to Strani.

1933
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:33,760
Let's go watch her stream.

1934
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:35,760
Bye bye for now.

1935
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:38,760
Bye bye.
