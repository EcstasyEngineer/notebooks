279440	287440	Mother tells me she had followed a trail from a mysterious wreckage and found me in a cave.
287440	291440	I was surrounded by death and darkness.
291440	294440	Yet I was the only one to survive.
294440	299440	This day she told me of was the last time I had ever cried.
299440	305440	She had seen the unfathomable abuse that plagued her family for generations.
306440	311440	A monster of a bear that wriggled fear throughout the food chain of this land.
311440	316440	Its mere presence pressing the very soil under the snow
316440	321440	that here it was that at the hands of a mere child
321440	324440	was said crying alone.
324440	328440	It was then she had decided to raise me as her own
328440	331440	along with my brother and sister.
331440	336440	She taught me strength to hunt to survive.
338440	341440	I had no memories of my birth family.
341440	344440	I did not feel the need to search for them
344440	348440	or I had my family here and they had me.
348440	353440	I was a bear like them and they treated me no different.
353440	356440	We all shared the same love
356440	359440	but mama knew it was not meant to be.
359440	361440	There comes a time in the bear's life
361440	364440	where they must go out on their own
364440	367440	and that time was approaching fast.
367440	370440	Mama knew the cops would be fine
370440	375440	but me I couldn't even find them being without them
375440	378440	until one day over the mountains
378440	381440	she happened upon an answer.
381440	384440	An answer I didn't want to accept
384440	387440	but one I had to.
387440	390440	And now this day
390440	394440	the day fear finally formed in my heart for the first time
394440	397440	saying their final goodbyes
397440	399440	my brother went one way
399440	402440	my sister went another
402440	404440	but there I stood
404440	406440	my body and mind
406440	409440	tempered from this land of unforgiving cold
409440	412440	was frozen still.
412440	416440	Mother offered me her strength one last time
416440	420440	enough to cement the final memory of her tenderness
420440	423440	my final goodbye
423440	426440	she would watch over me one last time
426440	429440	on my journey down from the mountain top
429440	431440	into the unknown of the future
431440	434440	the memory of her love within me
434440	436440	made the fear in my heart melt away
436440	439440	like the ice and spring
439440	442440	but she reminded me that the warmth of her love
442440	445440	made me into a survivor
447440	450440	The End
463440	466440	Hello everybody
466440	470440	Hi, it's so good to see you. Hello
470440	473440	My name is Icing Snowpaws
473440	477440	the feral polar bear from VLR's Generation 1
477440	479440	in Daulge
479440	482440	It's so good to see everyone
482440	488440	I have to admit, I'm feeling quite, you know, quite nervous
488440	491440	so I think the thing we should probably start with
491440	494440	how about we break the ice?
497440	500440	Come on!
503440	506440	Okay, well, that doesn't really seem to work that well
506440	509440	I got too big of a chunk of ice
509440	513440	so maybe we'll be able to break the ice a bit later
513440	515440	I hope you don't mind
515440	519440	With that being said, I heard from civilization
519440	522440	that it's supposed to be good manners
522440	526440	if you bring some nice food or a treat
526440	528440	to a big social gathering
528440	531440	which I assume what today is, right?
531440	535440	So, I actually made something for you to eat
535440	540440	I brought some fresh ice-cones just for you
540440	543440	and I really, really hope that you will like them
543440	546440	I put so much heart into them
546440	550440	and I was like, mmm, I really hope that they will enjoy them
550440	552440	Oh, awesome, don't worry
552440	555440	It's just lemon, nothing else, so...
555440	559440	Don't worry about it, it's very nice and delicious
560440	562440	Also, with that being said
562440	565440	I really want to go outside and play in the snow
565440	568440	so I can actually tell you a bit more about myself
568440	569440	You know why?
569440	574440	Because with my big pause paper is just kind of too much for me
574440	576440	and hard to deal with
576440	578440	So, I think what we should do
578440	581440	is you should come outside together with me
581440	583440	I know you're really cozy in your room
583440	585440	but I think we should go outside
585440	587440	Come on now!
590440	592440	Open the door
592440	597440	or I'm going to throw rock through your window, you dumb whore
615440	617440	Get back here, you little freak
619440	621440	Get back here, you little freak
639440	642440	Yay, we are now finally outside
642440	644440	I'm sorry I had to drag you out
644440	648440	but you know, you seem to be very resistive
648440	650440	so I thought it would be a good idea
650440	652440	if I just drag you out
653440	654440	With that being said
654440	657440	let's get to know me a little bit better
658440	660440	Let me drop over the snow
660440	663440	because that makes it easier on my pause
663440	665440	I hope you don't mind
665440	669440	So, my name is Isisnopause
669440	673440	My birthday, 27th of February
673440	675440	Did you actually know
675440	677440	that 27th of February
677440	680440	is also National Polar Bear Day?
680440	682440	Well, now you know
683440	684440	Age
684440	686440	I honestly have no idea
686440	689440	Animals do not really have concept of time
689440	692440	we do not keep track of stuff like ages
692440	695440	or what week it is and such
695440	697440	so you're just gonna have to
697440	699440	assume for yourself
700440	704440	My height is 142 cm
704440	707440	2 cm taller than Emi
707440	710440	That means I'm extra cool
711440	713440	My languages
713440	716440	I speak English and Russian
716440	718440	Привет всем
718440	720440	Меня зовут Isisnopause
720440	723440	Я очень рада вас видеть сегодня
723440	726440	Спасибо, что вы пришли увидеть меня
727440	728440	Ok
730440	732440	For the next information
732440	735440	we have some of my likes
735440	737440	and dislikes
737440	739440	I'll move a little bit
739440	741440	so you can see the full thing
741440	742440	Likes
742440	744440	I love popsicles
744440	745440	Very yummy
745440	746440	Refreshing
746440	747440	Cats
747440	749440	They're just so freaking cute
749440	752440	I have two cats over here
752440	754440	His name is Baklash
754440	757440	And her name is Potato
757440	760440	They're my two cats and I love them a lot
760440	762440	I love spinning on chairs
762440	765440	because it reminds me of amusement parks
765440	767440	and if I can't go to an amusement park
767440	769440	I can just go spin on chairs
769440	770440	It's just fun
770440	773440	Biting feels good against my teeth
773440	776440	Plushies, they're just so cute
776440	778440	There can never be enough of them
778440	780440	I just love collecting more and more
780440	782440	The feeling of nostalgia
782440	784440	Just makes me really really happy
784440	786440	That's really all there is to it
786440	789440	I love sparkly and shiny things
789440	792440	Like if I see glitter or something shiny
792440	794440	I just go
794440	797440	Wow, I need that
797440	799440	I need to see what's that about
799440	801440	I also love getting praised
801440	804440	I mean, who doesn't to be honest
804440	807440	Good words always make me smile
808440	810440	I love salmon and tuna
810440	812440	They're my favorite fish to eat
812440	814440	They're just so delicious
814440	816440	Really can't go wrong with them
816440	818440	I love sweet alcohol
818440	821440	Because if you give me something bitter
821440	823440	I'm just not gonna drink it
823440	825440	I like to have a nice flavor in my mouth
825440	828440	Coffee, I only drink it decaf
828440	832440	Because caffeine makes my tummy upset
832440	835440	Probably not good for a polar bear diet
835440	838440	This likes dust
838440	840440	Usually makes my nose
840440	842440	Like
842440	844440	Itchy and sneezy
844440	847440	And yeah, I just don't like it
847440	849440	Extreme heat
849440	852440	I mean, my body just doesn't deal well with it
852440	854440	Considering I'm a polar bear
854440	856440	So that's about that
856440	859440	Math, numbers, anything related to that
859440	862440	Just makes my brain extremely foggy
862440	864440	I love popcorn
864440	867440	But I hate when it gets stuck in my teeth
867440	871440	So I kind of have a love-hate relationship
871440	873440	With popcorn because of that
873440	875440	Because I'm always really scared
875440	877440	That a piece is gonna get stuck
877440	879440	And I'm not gonna be able to take it out
883440	886440	And next we have my tags
886440	888440	My Oshi mark
888440	891440	If you want to Oshi me and you like me
891440	894440	It's polar bear and an ice cube
894440	896440	My life tag is
896440	898440	Ice line
898440	900440	My fan art tag is
900440	902440	IC canvas
902440	904440	For, you know, more
904440	906440	Not safe work art
906440	907440	IC Oshi
907440	909440	For those of you who enjoy the more
909440	911440	Loot stuff
911440	912440	Clips
912440	913440	IC clipped
913440	914440	Memes
914440	916440	IC memes
916440	918440	And fan name, which is your name
918440	920440	Is snowberries
920440	922440	I was trying to find a name
922440	924440	That was supposed to be like
924440	926440	With a cute pond and stuff like that
926440	928440	And you look so cute
928440	930440	You look kind of like a blueberry
930440	932440	But you're also a bear
932440	934440	So I was like, hmm
934440	936440	Let's see what kind of name could I pick
936440	938440	That's like has a pond
938440	940440	And it's also like really cute and stuff
940440	942440	So I was like, wait
942440	944440	Snowberry sounds so cool and like
944440	946440	Just super cute
948440	950440	Also, before I go to the next slide
950440	952440	There will be some slides that you will not see
952440	954440	In this debut
954440	956440	You will have to come to my debut 2.0
956440	958440	In order to see the rest of the slides
958440	960440	As our time is
960440	962440	Fair limited today
962440	964440	So I hope you understand and
964440	966440	Maybe just get even more curious about me next
966440	968440	I also have
968440	970440	Lots of credits
970440	972440	For all the wonderful people
972440	974440	Who made today
974440	976440	Possible
976440	978440	They all worked very hard to make everything
978440	980440	Beautiful
980440	982440	Nice looking and I really appreciate
982440	984440	Everyone's hard work
984440	986440	That they've put into everything
986440	988440	That they've made
988440	990440	And now
990440	992440	Wow
992440	994440	If you are wondering
994440	996440	What this is
996440	998440	This is actually
998440	1000440	My little diary thing
1000440	1002440	And I like to write
1002440	1004440	Important things in my diary
1004440	1006440	And of course how could I not
1006440	1008440	Write in my diary about my friends
1008440	1010440	My beautiful gen mates
1010440	1012440	That I love so much
1012440	1014440	And that make me so happy
1016440	1018440	So let me
1018440	1020440	Let me start with
1020440	1022440	Strony
1022440	1024440	Strony there's just so much to say
1024440	1026440	She's so understanding
1026440	1028440	She's always there for me
1028440	1030440	She is so hard working
1030440	1032440	And it's like a quality that
1032440	1034440	I really wish that
1034440	1036440	I can become more like her
1036440	1038440	And learn to be more like her
1038440	1040440	It's just
1040440	1042440	It's humanly
1042440	1044440	Impossible to me
1044440	1046440	That someone is possible
1046440	1048440	Someone is able
1048440	1050440	Sorry
1050440	1052440	I'm drawing on my words a bit
1052440	1054440	Sorry
1054440	1056440	It's crazy
1056440	1058440	How much she works genuinely
1058440	1060440	And she's really amazing
1060440	1062440	So supportive really
1062440	1064440	But good things to say about her
1064440	1066440	Then we have
1066440	1068440	Shibi
1068440	1070440	Just look at her
1070440	1072440	She's just so cool
1072440	1074440	And I feel like if I was walking somewhere
1074440	1076440	And she was walking with me
1076440	1078440	I would just feel so much safety around her
1078440	1080440	Like she looks like
1080440	1082440	She could beat the shit out of someone
1082440	1084440	If they were trying to caress me
1084440	1086440	Or do something
1086440	1088440	And she's just overall really cool
1088440	1090440	And she's really
1090440	1092440	She's all of that
1092440	1094440	You know
1094440	1096440	Cold outside
1096440	1098440	Texture she has
1098440	1100440	She is very sweet
1100440	1102440	And I love her
1102440	1104440	And then we have Marcy
1104440	1106440	Our Yandere
1106440	1108440	She's very outgoing
1108440	1110440	Super sweet
1110440	1112440	And silly
1112440	1114440	One of the qualities that I hope to
1114440	1116440	Learn to be more like her
1116440	1118440	Is I hope that
1118440	1120440	I can be more outgoing like her
1120440	1122440	She is so good at like
1122440	1124440	Always initiating conversations
1124440	1126440	But I'm like the kind of person
1126440	1128440	Who is too scared to initiate conversations
1128440	1130440	With anyone
1130440	1132440	So I always talk like in group chat
1132440	1134440	But
1134440	1136440	I never initiate because I get really shy
1136440	1138440	And nervous
1138440	1140440	And stuff like that
1142440	1144440	I love Marcy
1144440	1146440	She's just so cute
1146440	1148440	And then
1148440	1150440	Then look who we have here
1150440	1152440	We have Amy
1152440	1154440	Amy is so freaking talented
1154440	1156440	Like
1156440	1158440	Is there anything that she cannot do
1158440	1160440	She's just so talented
1160440	1162440	And adorable and precious
1162440	1164440	And she gives me that feeling
1164440	1166440	Of wanting to protect her
1166440	1168440	Now I know that she can
1168440	1170440	Protect herself very well
1170440	1172440	Thanks to her book
1172440	1174440	But with that being said
1174440	1176440	If she ever lost that book
1176440	1178440	Or if something happened to it
1178440	1180440	You know, I would be there to protect her
1180440	1182440	With my claws
1182440	1184440	And make sure that she is okay
1184440	1186440	Hold on
1186440	1188440	Let me move a little bit
1188440	1190440	Make myself a little bit smaller
1190440	1192440	So we can see
1192440	1194440	The beautiful Ezra
1194440	1196440	Hold on
1198440	1200440	Okay, that's kind of better
1200440	1202440	I think
1204440	1206440	Okay
1206440	1208440	Okay, so we have Ezra
1208440	1210440	Oh my god, Ezra
1210440	1212440	Her voice is
1212440	1214440	Just so calming
1214440	1216440	Soothing
1216440	1218440	Even when she speaks normally
1218440	1220440	She always sounds so
1220440	1222440	Calming
1222440	1224440	It's insane, it's like she has
1224440	1226440	Just default ASMR voice
1226440	1228440	It's something I've never heard before
1228440	1230440	She is also very wise
1230440	1232440	And gentle
1232440	1234440	Like kind
1234440	1236440	And warm
1236440	1238440	And she really gives good
1238440	1240440	Wise advices as well
1240440	1242440	Like if I am not sure about something
1242440	1244440	Or I'm gonna do something
1244440	1246440	I usually like ask about it
1246440	1248440	And then she always comes up with
1248440	1250440	Good advices that just kind of
1250440	1252440	Make me go like
1252440	1254440	I should think about that
1254440	1256440	But yeah, she's just so smart
1256440	1258440	And yeah, I love
1258440	1260440	All of my gen mates
1260440	1262440	So amazing
1262440	1264440	They're all so sweet
1264440	1266440	All of them have amazing qualities
1266440	1268440	And I just feel so incredibly lucky
1268440	1270440	To be working alongside them
1270440	1272440	And be here today
1274440	1276440	I am now
1276440	1278440	Going to
1278440	1280440	Go to my room
1280440	1282440	So I can show you some of my toggles as well
1290440	1292440	Hi
1292440	1294440	Let me come in
1298440	1300440	Okay
1300440	1302440	I think this is good enough
1302440	1304440	I think this is fine
1304440	1306440	I have lots of animations
1306440	1308440	And different stuff to show you
1308440	1310440	So let's start with the first one
1312440	1314440	Whenever you make me angry
1314440	1316440	I hope you are careful
1316440	1318440	Because I'm definitely gonna use my claws
1318440	1320440	On you
1320440	1322440	And I will not hesitate to use some of you annoying me
1324440	1326440	But there are times when
1326440	1328440	You do say something really sweet to me
1328440	1330440	And
1330440	1332440	It makes me blush
1332440	1334440	And sometimes I do have my moments where
1334440	1336440	Even someone like me can get a bit
1336440	1338440	Flustered
1340440	1342440	I'm also having
1342440	1344440	A lot of tears of joy right now
1344440	1346440	Because everyone
1346440	1348440	Is making me so happy
1348440	1350440	Tears of joy are
1350440	1352440	Truly truly the best
1358440	1360440	Wow
1360440	1362440	Sometimes something suspicious happens
1362440	1364440	That really makes me think
1364440	1366440	And go hmm
1368440	1370440	Something's weird going on
1370440	1372440	Something's
1372440	1374440	Kind of suspicious
1374440	1376440	And
1376440	1378440	I also have
1378440	1380440	Heart eyes for all the times
1380440	1382440	That you make me feel extremely
1382440	1384440	Loved and happy
1384440	1386440	So you will get to see me
1386440	1388440	Show a bit of love every once in a while
1388440	1390440	Even I have
1390440	1392440	My soft side as well
1394440	1396440	What happened?
1396440	1398440	What's that?
1398440	1400440	What? I can hear you
1400440	1402440	Wow
1402440	1404440	So many people
1404440	1406440	Wow
1408440	1410440	You know
1410440	1412440	Sometimes disappointing things happen as well
1412440	1414440	And you just go
1416440	1418440	Oh well
1418440	1420440	But that is not today
1420440	1422440	That is definitely not today
1424440	1426440	I don't know if you remember
1426440	1428440	But I actually talked about dust
1428440	1430440	And my room is a bit dusty
1430440	1432440	And dust makes me sneeze
1432440	1434440	And my nose itchy
1434440	1436440	And stuff like that
1436440	1438440	So sometimes
1438440	1440440	It makes me sneeze
1444440	1446440	Kind of like
1446440	1448440	Kind of like right now
1448440	1450440	Wait I think
1450440	1452440	I feel another one coming
1452440	1454440	Another one coming
1454440	1456440	Never mind
1456440	1458440	Never mind
1458440	1460440	I don't feel it anymore
1460440	1462440	I don't feel it anymore
1464440	1466440	I wonder if I'm
1466440	1468440	Missing anything
1470440	1472440	Actually yes I am
1472440	1474440	I just remembered
1474440	1476440	I don't know if you guys know
1476440	1478440	But polar bears don't hibernate actually
1478440	1480440	So I have times
1480440	1482440	When I get extremely tired
1482440	1484440	And that results in me
1484440	1486440	Having dark eye circles
1486440	1488440	That's
1488440	1490440	Honestly going to be me today
1490440	1492440	Because I have to stay up extremely late
1492440	1494440	So
1494440	1496440	If you see me during the group collab
1496440	1498440	And I look like this
1498440	1500440	You know why because I'm extremely tired
1500440	1502440	And sleepy
1504440	1506440	Last but not least
1506440	1508440	Before we go to the next thing
1508440	1510440	I have my
1510440	1512440	Schedule
1512440	1514440	Yay

1526440	1528440	Tomb Raider Legend
1528440	1530440	After that I will be playing

1532440	1534440	And then Wednesday
1534440	1536440	I'll be napping and recharging

1538440	1540440	We'll be playing little polar bear
1540440	1542440	And the great bear

1544440	1546440	And my polar bear life
1546440	1548440	And then Friday
1548440	1550440	I'll be doing some ASMR stream
1552440	1554440	And then Saturday
1554440	1556440	It's gonna be a very fun stream
1556440	1558440	Saturday is going to be
1558440	1560440	An archive DJ stream
1560440	1562440	Where I'll also be drinking
1562440	1564440	And when I DJ I party hard
1564440	1566440	I go hard
1566440	1568440	So I hope you get all the energy that you can
1568440	1570440	Because we'll be playing lots of amazing music
1570440	1572440	And we'll be doing lots of good stuff
1574440	1576440	Okay now that we've been
1576440	1578440	Talking for a bit
1578440	1580440	And showing you the schedule
1580440	1582440	The slides
1582440	1584440	I think we need to do something
1584440	1586440	Something a little bit more like
1586440	1588440	Big and exciting and fun
1588440	1590440	Like you know
1590440	1592440	Sledges are nice
1592440	1594440	And all of that
1594440	1596440	But we should really celebrate
1596440	1598440	Via Laura's big debut today
1598440	1600440	And all of our wonderful girls
1600440	1602440	So I think
1602440	1604440	What we should do right now
