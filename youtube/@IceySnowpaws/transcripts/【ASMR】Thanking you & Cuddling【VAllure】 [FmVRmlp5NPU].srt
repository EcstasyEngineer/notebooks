You

11
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,680
You

12
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,680
You

13
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,680
You

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,680
You

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,680
You

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,680
You

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,680

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
You

21
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,680
You

22
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,680
Hello my sweet snowberries. Hi.

23
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Hello. Hello.

24
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,680
I hope that you are doing well today.

25
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,680
I have a bit of problems with my throat.

26
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:44,680
So if I don't speak as much as I usually do during my ASMR streams, that's why then on top of that I also have a migraine as well.

27
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:54,680
I take some painkillers before the stream but they still didn't kick in yet.

28
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:04,680
So sorry in advance if I'm not at my best performance today.

29
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,680
I hope you can understand.

30
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Feel free to end stream really if it's too much. Yeah I will but for now I'm completely okay.

31
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,680
I miss you a lot and I really want to spend some time together.

32
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Thank you.

33
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:38,680
So yesterday, as some of you know, I kind of had a day for disconnecting from you.

34
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:48,680
From what I do and from breathing anything and from social media etc.

35
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,680
And I'll be honest, it was so fucking difficult.

36
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,680
It was like really really difficult.

37
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:06,680
I legitimately felt like a physical feeling in my chest.

38
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:22,680
My chest felt really tight the whole day because I kept wanting to read everything and respond to things and all of that.

39
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:30,680
So it was really more difficult than I thought it would be.

40
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:44,680
And that's kind of scary because it literally felt like how people describe it when you're addicted to something.

41
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:56,680
And then you try to stop doing it and you just have the strongest urges to do it.

42
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:08,680
And you have to basically restrain yourself and it takes so much control and effort to do that.

43
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:16,680
With that being said, I don't think you realized actually what happened yesterday.

44
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,680
Yes, I did disconnect from everything.

45
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:34,680
However, I actually ended up not going outside because I was so sleepy and tired

46
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,680
that I ended up just like sleeping pretty much the whole day.

47
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,680
So basically what happened is I woke up.

48
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:54,680
I was awake for like a little bit, got sleepy, went back to sleep, woke up again.

49
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:04,680
I had lunch, watched some videos, felt sleepy again, went back to sleep again until like 6pm.

50
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,680
Like no joke, I woke up at like 6pm.

51
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,680
I was so sleepy, like really really sleepy.

52
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,680
And so when I woke up at like 6pm I was like fuck, I'm so tired.

53
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:28,680
Like I really really don't want to go anywhere.

54
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:36,680
So I just, yeah, yesterday was just me just sleeping pretty much.

55
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,680
I didn't go outside.

56
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:54,680
But I actually did go outside today because I still wanted to go outside like I promised myself.

57
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:04,680
So I did go outside and I just walked around and just breathed some nice fresh air.

58
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,680
The weather was really nice.

59
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,680
It was like warm but not overbearing, you know.

60
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,680
There was like a nice wind.

61
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:24,680
And actually in the middle of it it started raining really hard, like out of nowhere.

62
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:32,680
And everyone was like surprised because on the weather forecast it was not supposed to rain today.

63
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,680
But it did.

64
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,680
But it was really refreshing because I could smell, you know, that good scent of the rain.

65
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:50,680
So it was like, but fresh rain, scent.

66
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:58,680
It was extremely nice and refreshing.

67
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:20,680
And then I went to a store just to see if there's anything I need or if there's any like stuff that I could like maybe use for ASMR triggers.

68
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:33,680
And it's pretty crazy but when I was there, there was a song that started playing.

69
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:45,680
And the beginning of that song sounded a lot like fade into you, the song that I was singing at the karaoke.

70
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:55,680
So when I heard like the first few seconds of the melody, like I instantly like thought about, you know, the karaoke night we had.

71
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,680
And my heart like skipped a beat, you know.

72
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:09,680
And then, and not after that, they played Braining Man.

73
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Like I'm not fucking kidding, they played Braining Man.

74
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,680
And I was like, no fucking way, no fucking way.

75
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:31,680
I thought it was really crazy because you know, I go outside to disconnect from you, right?

76
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,680
And not think about any of this.

77
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:42,680
But then even when I go outside, you know, to distract myself, there's things that remind me of you.

78
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:52,680
Like the songs from the karaoke that started playing and like instantly like my brain went, what the fuck?

79
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,680
Like no, no, no way that happened.

80
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:08,680
And I instantly, you know, smiled and remembered how amazing the karaoke was and how much fun I had.

81
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:36,680
I also ordered some food to get home with me.

82
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:53,680
It was like this really, really good like dish salad that had like grilled vegetables and some lettuce and like small baby potatoes.

83
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,680
It was so freaking good, holy fuck.

84
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,680
Like I didn't not expect it to taste that good, but it was really, really fucking good.

85
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:19,680
I think I think it had like red peppers in it, eggplant, some lettuce and some, I don't know what else was there.

86
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:29,680
There were more stuff, but I don't remember the name of it, but anyways, it tasted really, really, really good as the point.

87
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:36,680
So I was really happy that I got that.

88
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:48,680
So when I was at the store, I bought like this lollipop chupa chups.

89
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,680
This is a lollipop candy.

90
00:17:51,680 --> 00:18:05,680
I bought it because when I was a kid, I remember I used to really love these and I haven't had it since then, pretty much.

91
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:17,680
So I thought I could buy it and maybe I'll use it too for some of my smart triggers, possibly.

92
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,680
The flavor is strawberry.

93
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:54,680
And then I bought like this squishy stress toy, I guess.

94
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:01,680
It's very like bright pink, and it has like a really stupid and silly face.

95
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:13,680
And I thought maybe I could use it as an ASMR trigger, but to be fair, I don't know how good of a sound it makes.

96
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:39,680
It actually sounds pretty nice.

97
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:48,680
I'm glad to hear that, because the thing is, it was inside like a packaging.

98
00:19:48,680 --> 00:20:06,680
So it was hard for me to figure out exactly what it's going to sound like outside of it, but it's a squishy toy, so I thought maybe it would make good sounds.

99
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,680
I also have bubble wrap.

100
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:27,680
I remember that someone has requested bubble wrap as an ASMR trigger, so today's your lucky day, because they have some bubble wrap.

101
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:50,680
The bubble wrap makes really, really good sounds, really tingly ones, I think.

102
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:56,680
So I have a feeling most of you would probably enjoy it.

103
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Okay, let me bring the bubble wrap.

104
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,680
I can't wait to talk.

105
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:55,680
Right, it sounds so good, doesn't it?

106
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:24,680
I think bubble wrap makes really good sounds.

107
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,680
I think a decent bubble wrap makes a lot of sounds.

108
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:07,680
I'm kicking and thinking of forgetting a text from why is he saying this song remind me of you and the speaker explodes with a training man.

109
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,680
Thank you.

110
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,680
Super.

111
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,680
Packaging my tea sands up to ship them to your address.

112
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,680
Okay, real.

113
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,680
Thank you.

114
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,680
I'm here.

115
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:51,680
That's why I need to wrap you in bubble wrap so I can be shipped to your address.

116
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,680
Okay.

117
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Okay.

118
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,680
Okay.

119
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Okay.

120
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,680
Okay.

121
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,680
Okay.

122
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,680
I love pulling you together like a ship.

123
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,680
Okay.

124
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,680
Okay.

125
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,680
I love you.

126
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,680
Okay.

127
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,680
I love you.

128
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,680
Touch.

129
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Okay.

130
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,680
Okay.

131
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,680
I hope it's okay with you.

132
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,680
It'll be right back.

133
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
Okay, I need to.

134
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
I need to be super super fat.

135
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,680
I'll be right back.

136
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,680
I'll be right back.

137
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
Okay.

138
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,680
Okay.

139
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
I love you.

140
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,680
I love you.

141
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,680
Take it.

142
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Okay.

143
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Okay.

144
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,680
Okay.

145
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,680
Okay.

146
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
Okay.

147
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:16,680
So I see how if you're playing the game again, huh?

148
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:25,680
I'm actually wearing black panties today.

149
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,680
And thank you for all the welcome back.

150
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,680

00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,740
Scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch.

180
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:34,740
Scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch.

181
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,740
Scratch, scratch.

182
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:51,740
ca-chis-chis, ca-chis-chis

183
00:38:51,740 --> 00:39:06,740
ca-chis-chis, ca-chis-chis, ca-chis-chis

184
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,740
Plus six

188
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,740
outside

189
00:39:44,740 --> 00:40:13,240
oh my god, I can't... I can't find the juice... I can't find the juice

190
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:22,740
somber, thank you so much for joining funpush it, I love

191
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,740
you

192
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:41,740
how do you come up with these triggers?

193
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:50,740
I just look around the house and see if there's anything I can make good sounds with

194
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,740
that's pretty much all it is

195
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:38,740
make good choices, this is super comfy, yay, thank you

196
00:42:38,740 --> 00:43:04,740
I try my best to find the triggers every time there's an ASMR stream

197
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:12,740
can we get something in Russian too? depends, like what?

198
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:42,740
I would say that, but my parents hooked my thoughts

199
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:52,740
so how about I say that in the member stream? would that be okay?

200
00:43:52,740 --> 00:44:04,740
I could say that in a member stream tomorrow, but I can still say I love you in Russian

201
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,740
I love you

202
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:33,740
I love you

203
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,740
very much

204
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:53,740
what do you mean discovered? they know

205
00:44:53,740 --> 00:45:02,740
what do you mean oof? they support me, they're very sweet about it

206
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:37,740
so they approve of your misters, I mean I think they would prefer if I have one mister

207
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,740
but

208
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:51,740
hello Kevin, thank you for the membership, welcome

209
00:45:51,740 --> 00:46:07,740
I can't, you always make me laugh, you're so funny

210
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:27,740
for 100 people turning up to your brand's house to ask permission to marry you

211
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:37,740
imagine, oh my god, my dad would be like, what the fuck, who are these people?

212
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:48,740
fucking kicks you down the fucking stairs, punches you

213
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:06,740
oh my god, now we'd win

214
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:21,740
my dad is super nice, he's really sweet, he's not much of a talker and he looks very serious but he's a good person

215
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:38,740
it's good to be an interesting family for you

216
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:50,740
I don't think that would be enough space for all of you to be honest, they live like in a really really small apartment

217
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:04,740
basement, they don't have a basement

218
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:23,740
can I just hang out on the porch with Bob up here while the other guy sits right there

219
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:31,740
I mean, I suppose if you get to talk to him then maybe your chance is higher

220
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:38,740
than if you spend it fighting with others

221
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:48,740
like if you drink a beer with him or something like that then he would enjoy that

222
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:27,740
I don't drink though, well, if you don't drink, I don't know how you're gonna bond with my dad to be honest

223
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:38,740
oh my god, pure and fraught, I fucking can't

224
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:43,740
rogue Robin, thank you so much for the membership, welcome in

225
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,740
can I live in the fridge?

226
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,740
no

227
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:56,740
I can take him to dinner and go fishing

228
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:05,740
fishing, he would love the heck out of that, my dad actually loves fishing

229
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:11,740
sometimes he goes on the weekends fishing with his friends

230
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:17,740
and then he comes back home and cooks the fish that he got for my mom

231
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:24,740
and it always makes her extremely happy, I think it's super sweet

232
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:47,740
ah

233
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:21,740
the real question is if Papa Bear is single, what the fuck, no

234
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:29,740
my parents are married for like 25 years, they are very much happily married

235
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:37,740
they're definitely not single, happily married for 25 years

236
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:15,740
no, there's no chance, shut up, I love my parents' relationship and their marriage

237
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:31,740
they're the only reason that I have hope that marriages can work and that you can be married for so long

238
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:39,740
and still show affection to each other and still do nice gestures for each other

239
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:47,740
you know, not to have this basically dead relationship just because you're married

240
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:58,740
so they're literally the reason that I still believe that it's possible to have a really good and healthy marriage

241
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:14,740
like, whenever it's her anniversary or her birthday, my dad always buys her either jewelry or some flowers and stuff like that

242
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:23,740
and you know, when he goes fishing, he really likes to cook the fish that he gets for her

243
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:31,740
and they love traveling as well, which is another thing that I think is super cute

244
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:44,740
at least once a year they go travel somewhere around the world and you know, enjoy their life to the best together and make memories

245
00:53:44,740 --> 00:54:02,740
so, yeah, I really love the relationship that my parents have and they would be like the perfect example for, you know, a good, healthy and loving marriage

246
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:09,740
do they always travel together?

247
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,740
do they always travel together?

248
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,740
yes, always

249
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,740
yes, always

250
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:33,740
like, a couple of months ago, it was my dad's birthday

251
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:42,740
and my mom basically planned a trip to Austria with him

252
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:53,740
and I actually took a train to Austria so that I could see my dad and celebrate his birthday together with him

253
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:56,740
so, yeah

254
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,740
I love their relationship

255
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,740
their relationship

256
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,740
and I love them in general

257
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:17,740
they have always been very sweet and supportive of me, always loving and I really can't say enough good things about my mom and dad

258
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:20,740
both very amazing people

259
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:27,740
and my grandparents

260
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:36,740
my grandparents have been married for like 60 years

261
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:42,740
would have been longer if he didn't pass away

262
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:48,740
but basically they had like, you know, a really good relationship as well

263
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:54,740
and the way that they met is actually a crazy story

264
00:55:54,740 --> 00:56:05,740
if you want, I'll tell you like, the crazy story about my grandma and grandpa got together

265
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:12,740
when my mom told me the story, it was like, holy shit, that's crazy

266
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:29,740
so basically, so back story, my grandpa was actually already engaged

267
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:35,740
and he was actually supposed to have a wedding and marry someone

268
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:43,740
and just one day, when he was at the train station

269
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:51,740
my grandma just casually walked out of that train

270
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:59,740
and he saw her and he just like, you know, like instantly knew that she's the one

271
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:03,740
like, he saw her and he knew that she's the one

272
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:09,740
and he ended up cancelling the wedding

273
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:16,740
and, you know, tried to get my grandma's attention

274
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:20,740
and, you know, get her and he did

275
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:25,740
and they've had a really amazing relationship

276
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:30,740
and they have been married for 60 years

277
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:34,740
freaking 60 years, you know

278
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:46,740
so, yeah, it's like, sometimes, sometimes, like, he just knew, you know, like, he saw her

279
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:53,740
and he instantly knew that, yes, this is my person, you know, this is the person that

280
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:59,740
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with and he just did everything he could

281
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:03,740
to, you know, get together with her

282
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:10,740
and they ended up getting married and being married for 60 years

283
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:19,740
so, yeah, that's the story of how my grandparents got together

284
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,740
so

285
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:53,740
you're not a feminist, you're just

286
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,740
thank you

you know how our story so gets your mother was made for with lots of this

290
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:48,740
I fucking can't, but there will be no kids

291
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,740
no kids, because I don't want kids

292
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,740
I am the kid

293
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:57,740
I respect them

294
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:01,740
I respect them

295
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,740
I

296
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:50,740

298
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:58,740
they, they don't know English really, like, barely anything

299
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,740
that's fine

300
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,740
so good, that's

01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,740
so easy

303
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,740
I mean, if

304
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,740
that's the idea

305
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,740
shh

306
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:19,740

307
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,740

It's great love

It's great love for chance

315
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:56,740
It's great love for chance

316
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:11,740

I don't like to hug, I don't like to hug daddy.

I don't like to hug daddy, I don't like to hug daddy, I don't like to hug daddy.
