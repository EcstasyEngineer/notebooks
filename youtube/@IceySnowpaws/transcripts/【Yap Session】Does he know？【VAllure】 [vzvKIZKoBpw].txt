I was gonna talk a bit and stuff, and like, thank the people who donated as well, and I was like, I feel, and I don't know why the fuck, but I accidentally clicked like the exit thing, and my OBS fucking closed, and I was like, fuck, how did that even happen, so yeah, I do, I do apologize, I do apologize,
for that, because that was not the plan, I did want to like chat a bit, you know, but yeah, so that happened, yesterday's stream was wild, but like in the best way possible, like, I was so fucking happy, and I was having so much fun, but I did feel like so brain dead like the entire time,
like, it felt like a fever dream, it felt like really surreal, it felt like I was on a trip or something, to be honest, like, it was really something, but it was so much fun, like, I couldn't stop laughing, I just enjoyed being my unhinged self, and just being silly, and hanging out with the girls,
and us being all silly, and having fun together, because like, because I missed doing that kind of stuff, because you know, before the debut, you know, we didn't stream, right, so we had a lot more time to like hang out together, or stuff like that, but you know, after the debut, we all have to like focus on establishing ourselves, and
and you know, have to stream, and always have like some other stuff that we always like need to do, so it's like, you know, it's more complicated to be in a situation where we can all like catch each other, if that makes sense, I don't know if that makes sense,
but yeah, so it was really nice to be able to do that again, I had a blast, it was really good,
it's good, you're seemingly all pretty good friends, yeah, they're all very, very sweet, and nice girls to be around, I feel very lucky to have them as my gen mates, you know, because when I initially joined, you know, there's always that fear of like, oh, you know, I wonder what the people, the other people will be like, when
they join, and if, you know, we'll get along, because like, you know, for me, I always wanted to be in like a corpus so that I can make friends with the girls in it, and so that we can grow closer and closer together, because we're all in this together, and we all, you know, try to reach our dreams together, and
and just, you know, like really build like a special friendship, thanks to that, and you know, it turned out to be like, it turned out to be like so amazing, you know, they're also sweet, also nice, all like so helpful when either one of us needs help, or something happens, or like looking out for each other, it's truly amazing, it makes me really happy, you know, it's amazing, I
like, I am, I really am living the dream, I really am, like my dream became truly a reality, I just feel so lucky to have such amazing gen mates, and I feel so incredibly lucky to have you in my community, because you're all just so amazing and kind and sweet to me, and that's crazy, you know, like I was not expecting
for things to turn out like this amazingly, or like this, like overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly positive, sorry, it's hard for me to say some words, overwhelmingly positive, you know, like I just, like, let me explain, like I did not know what my community is going to be like, right, like I did not know like how it's going to develop, or
how it's going to do happen, and then like it just, all of you turned out to be just so freaking amazing and so sweet, like, how does that happen?
Okay, okay, I actually, okay, this, I don't know if I should say that, but, I don't know if I should say that, but I wanted to make like a meme, I wanted to make like a meme of like two different pictures, and the first one says,
the first one says, me, how I felt about men, before Vealor, versus how I feel about men, after Vealor, because of you snowberries, because of you snowberries, so basically I was going to put like a picture on the first image, where I just looked pissed off at the first picture, and I was like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't
know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, so
Wow, some men really are amazing, huh?
Some men really are really, really sweet and nice.
Maybe not all men are trash after all.
Some are really, really sweet.
But yeah, so thank you for that.
Thank you for being so amazing that you were able to change my mind.
You can call me trash if you want.
I don't know about that. I don't know. I would feel really bad.
Because you're all so sweet.
You know, I see the reasons reflect what I see shows to us.
You're so sweet, I see. No. You're so sweet.
I genuinely mean it, though.
After talking to all of you and seeing how kind you are
and caring and sweet towards me, I was like, damn.
Okay, so maybe not all men are trash after all.
Some men really can be sweet and nice and kind, you know?
And it's nice. I don't know how to word it.
But basically what I'm trying to say is that I love you
and you're so amazing that you made me change my mind.
So I hope that makes sense.
You give up great vibes.
I can tell you're not a sweet kind of person.
Oh, thank you. Thank you. I try to be.
But I can be a bitch sometimes, I think.
I don't know.
Okay, so you know how you say that?
You think that I'm like a sweet person and stuff?
I don't know why, but whenever people tell me
that they think I'm very sweet or nice, it kind of scares me.
Not like scares me.
Okay, scares is a strong word.
It's a strong word.
I don't know if that's the word I would use.
It's more like...
I think it's like when people worry,
maybe worry is a better word.
Yeah, maybe.
So sometimes it worries me or scares me
because I am like...
How do I word this?
Like I know what I want to say,
but I don't know how to word it or explain it
in a way that makes sense.
Basically, when people call me very nice
or super nice or super sweet,
my brain is like...
My brain is like,
no, I don't want you to think that
because every person has their moments.
Every person is going to have their bad days
or days when they're not all that sweet,
or they get angry or they get mean
or like...
I don't know.
Do you know what I'm trying to...
I don't know if it makes sense
what I'm trying to explain.
I hope it does.
But I don't know if it makes any sense.
You don't want to disappoint them
if they think you're always nice.
Maybe that's part of it.
But I also like...
I guess I don't want people to have the expectations
or think that I'm perfect
because no one is perfect.
Everyone deals with their shit.
Everyone has their...
not so great sides and stuff like that.
But what's important is that...
What's important is that the good stuff
overwhelm the bad, basically.
Basically that there's more good than bad
or that the good is stronger than the bad.
I don't know if that makes sense.
Doesn't make sense.
Outweight, maybe?
Overpower, maybe?
Do you see what I'm trying to explain?
I feel like I'm maybe like a mother.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I feel like I'm maybe like a...
I have trouble wording stuff
that I want to say sometimes.
Makes sense, yes.
Doesn't?
Okay, that's good.
I'm glad to hear that.
Because basically that's what I'm trying to say.
You...
We all have our different sides
and different parts of us
that aren't so great.
I do too, you know?
I do too, you know?
Even if you see me
only the sweet sides of me all the time
or all the good parts of me,
that doesn't mean that...
I don't have those bad parts either,
because I do and everyone does.
But when it comes to love,
it's about loving the person
despite the bad stuff
and that the good overpowers
any of those other stuff
that might be bad
or not ideal, I guess.
You know?
Sorry for the big yap.
I'm sorry for the big yap.
I feel like I'm being too serious or something.
I'm sorry for being weird
or too serious and stuff.
I hope I'm explaining myself well
because sometimes I'm scared that I don't...
that I don't make sense.
It's from the heart, so it's okay.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
I get so nervous that I'm being too much
or the stuff that I say are...
I don't know.
I'm overthinking it as always.
I overthink stuff a lot.
If you couldn't tell by now,
I overthink a lot and get paranoid sometimes
and just worry a lot.
I just want to do my very best
at the end of the day.
We will love, bitch.
I see too. Don't worry.
Thank you.
I'm glad that you will still love me
even when I'm being a bitch.
Your best is more than enough.
Thank you.
That means a lot to me.
Thank you so much.
I can get that way too.
You're not going to be so hard on yourself.
I'll try.
Time to brush up on the bread taming skills.
I mean, you pretty much tamed me.
I mean, let's be real.
You pretty much tamed me.
And it took just a few days.
If you haven't done that, so...
That's so fucking embarrassing.
I still can get over it. I hate it.
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Why are you just doing it?
Although I just still like to be a bread
every now and then.
I still like to do that stuff.
But I'm a sweet bread.
I think I would consider myself a sweet bread.
I don't know if that even makes sense,
but that's the best way that I can think of it.
You can just love me so much that bread is really fun.
Aw, thank you.
I love you too.
You are just too cute.
Thank you.
I'm really glad you think so.
I'm really glad to hear that.
I don't know, reading all of your kind words always
makes me just so happy, truly.
The bread is so cute.
Mr. may pretend to be irritated,
but it's just too flustered to admit he's happy.
Aw, that's really sweet.
To be honest though, to be honest though,
if I genuinely thought that you're like genuinely irritated with me,
I'm not gonna lie.
I would probably fucking cry.
I would be like fuck.
He fucking hates me.
It's so fucking over.
I'm gonna go KMS.
He doesn't love me anymore.
My brain just gets really fucking dramatic
because I overthink stuff.
You know, like, I don't know if I should even say that,
but I mean fuck it, fuck it.
Like, I'm the type of person that like, you know,
that like, if I don't get like a response for a while
and stuff like that,
or if I talk about something
and you don't touch like base on it,
even if you like just forgot to or something,
my brain instantly ghost you.
Oh no, they don't like me as much anymore.
Oh no, they're falling out of love.
Oh no, no, it's so over.
No, they don't care about what I said.
That's why they didn't respond to it.
That's literally me and it's like...
It's...
It's something.
But yeah.
I have a problem.
I have a problem.
I relate so hard.
I see everything can worry so hard.
Yeah, I'm glad it's not just me.
I'm glad it's not just me though.
It's good to know that because like, you know,
it's so easy to get worried about stuff like that.
You know, like...
It's just...
I don't know.
It's overwhelming, I guess.
And when you're an over-thinker,
and you're like me, then like,
it gets like, you know, brain-worms and stuff and...
But I try like...
I really try my best though to like,
not to think that way.
Like, anytime that I get worried about stuff like that,
I try to force myself and tell myself that that's not the case.
And that, you know,
either you're busy,
or either you didn't see what I wrote,
or you forgot to talk about something,
or et cetera, et cetera,
or you will touch base on it later,
or you will respond.
Or like, you know, like I'm trying to like,
stop being like...
Like stop thinking worst-case scenario, I guess,
and learn to rewire my brain to think like,
best-case scenario.
Like, and not instantly like,
go to the bad extreme side of things.
And it's hard, and it's hard because,
you know, your brain is wired like a certain way
for a long time.
So once you try to rewire it,
like, you literally like, have to like,
literally just force yourself to think a certain way.
And only after you do it long enough,
it slowly starts like,
you know, getting better.
I see the secret is that we sometimes get that way too,
so no worries.
I'm glad to hear that in a way.
Like, I am not glad that you feel that way,
because I mean, let's be honest,
feeling like that is always shit.
Feeling like that is always bad, right?
Like, it's never a good feeling to feel like that.
But when I say I'm glad you feel that way,
I mean it as in, I'm glad that...
It's not just me who feels like that,
if that makes sense.
Like, I'm glad that like,
it's not just me who like,
you know, over things.
You aren't that crazy yet.
I mean, you don't know that.
What if I am?
You don't know me?
What if I am?
No, my crazy is contained.
I take medication.
I take meds.
My crazy is contained
as much as it can be anyways.
There's only so much meds can do.
There's only so much meds can do,
you know, they keep me as stable as I can be,
basically, so yeah.
So, shout out to my meds.
Me too, she's just like me for real, for real.
We don't want it contained.
Oh, trust me, it's...
It's really bad if I don't have my meds.
It's best for myself and everyone else,
but I do take my meds, to be honest.
Otherwise, my...
Yeah, so...
Wow, this is you on meds?
Yeah, this is me on meds.
I always do what's best for yourself.
Yeah, that's exactly it.
I'm glad that I have meds that work for me.
It took me like a few years to actually find
something that works properly for me.
I feel bad.
I feel like I'm trauma dumping on you right now.
Am I trauma dumping?
Fuck, I should just stop.
I feel so bad.
Am I trauma dumping right now?
I can't tell.
Like, I'm just trying to like talk with you
and, you know, get to know each other better
and get closer, I guess.
But I don't know if I'm trauma dumping.
Maybe I should just play the game and shut up.
No, you're not. It's fine, darling.
No, it's perfectly okay. I keep talking.
No, we're just bonding.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm just making sure.
I'm just making sure.
Because when I talk about this stuff,
it's my way to bond with you, I guess.
Like, having you get to know me better, you know?
So, your anxiety is getting to you.
It's not trauma dumping.
Why would we consider trauma dumping, then?
Now I'm scared.
Now I'm scared.
What if I accidentally start trauma dumping, though?
That's so bad!
Oh, no!
I see this isn't trauma dumping.
Saying I take meds for health isn't dumping.
Yeah, who am I talking about, nearly?
It's an unhealthy term, honestly.
Usually sharing trauma with friends is helpful.
Okay, okay.
Okay, listen, I agree.
You know what? I agree.
Can I just say that I kind of agree?
Like...
Like, if you talk to your friends,
or people that are close to you,
and you tell them that stuff,
I don't think that's trauma dumping.
Like...
You know?
I feel like that's a way to bond with someone
and be there for them.
Like, yeah, if a random...
It's trauma dumping, if it's a random person
that I don't fucking know at all.
Just going outside, I'm sitting at a bench,
and...
Someone random sits next to me,
and they're like telling me their life trauma.
Like, you know?
You know?
Like, okay, like...
Yeah.
The term, like many others, is way to overuse these days.
People call any sort of emotional talk trauma dumping these days.
Okay, that's so true.
I completely agree.
Yeah, I completely agree with that.
That is so true.
I agree.
There's a lot of terms that are getting, like, overused,
and people, like, don't even know, like,
the real meaning behind them anymore.
We care about you, so we want to talk about this stuff.
Yeah, language gets weird, yeah.
I agree.
I feel like it gets weirder the more time goes.
Like, there's always, like, new terms popping up,
and I'm just, like, pro...
Can we just, like, talk normally like we used to years ago?
I'm okay with hearing you talk about anything.
Okay, that's good to know.
Heavy words being used too lightly.
Yeah, exactly!
Okay, literally that, though, like, using heavy words
and using them way too often and, like, too lightly.
Like, brah, you know?
Like, not every single fucking thing is trauma dumping, okay?
It took me too long to learn what risk was.
Okay, same, same!
That's, it's not just you, it's not just you.
Same.
After the longest time when I saw the word, like, risk going around,
I was like, what the fuck does that shit even mean?
What the fuck is risk?
Like, there's all this, like, fucking zoomer fucking terms,
and I'm just like, bro, what?
What the fuck is what?
I sit up to your risler.
I don't, I don't know, I don't know if I am.
I don't know if I am.
I don't know if you remember, but my experience with Rufus
in Rockstar Simulator wasn't very good.
I don't think I had much risk at all.
Oh my god.
Maybe I see what's the realer she said after all.
Fuck you, I'm not!
I'm a baby.
Fuck you.
Just for, just, okay, listen.
Just for calling me that, just for calling me that.
I'm no longer gonna call you dadda.
I'm just gonna call you a bitch from now.
If you say that to me, you are not my dadda, okay?
If you call me that, you are no longer my daddy.
Bye.
How dare you?
It's so over.
Real.
Be right back, but gotta get mad.
No, don't do that.
No, don't kill yourself.
You're so sexy.
That's fucking meme.
No, don't kill yourself.
You're so sexy.
It's funny to me cause it's true.
It's funny to me cause some people literally would say stuff like that to you.
It's funny cause it's true.
Some people generally would say that to you.
Like some people like you're gonna like tell them like you're depressed or something.
And their response is gonna be like you can't be depressed here.
Too beautiful for that.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
That's not how my brain works.
No, my battery is low on my tracking.
Fuck, I need to charge it.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Give me a moment.
I need to be right back and put my phone on charger.
Or I'm not gonna have my tracking anymore.
And I'm gonna die.

Wait, why the fuck was I muted?
I was muted!
No!
What the fuck?
Okay, so now I have to say that all over again.
Oh my god, I hate this shit.
I was saying I'm so sorry for taking so long,
because I put in the charger
and it wasn't charging, so I was freaking out.
And as I was freaking out,
I accidentally like bruised my knee
because I hit it against something like a dumbass.
So ow.
Anyways,
that should be fine.
That shouldn't be a problem now.
It is charging now.
It is charging now.
I'm fine.
Time to kiss it better.
Yeah, kiss it better for me.
That would make me happy.
Kiss it better to make the bruise go away.
Kiss it better to make the bruise go away.
Please be careful.
I tried.
I'm okay though.
I'm just being a baby about it to be honest.
It's fine.
Thank you.
Thank you for all the kisses.
Or maybe add more bruises.
I mean,
that depends.
Only in certain situations.
It has to be a bruise of love.
It has to be a bruise of love, you know?
It can just be like anything.
So you're saying,
yeah.
Yeah, hickeys.
So that everyone knows that I belong to you.
Like your way
of marking me.
Maybe a little red bottom.
Yeah!
I want like your hand print.
Left on my bottoms.
That's how hard
I want you to do it.
I want you to do it like so strongly
that it leaves
like a mark
of your hand.
I would love that.
And also for it, you know,
to sting a bit
for a few minutes or so.
Because then the stinging
from the pain
reminds me
who I belong to.
You know?
Fuck!
I'm being so down bad already.
What the fuck?
I'm just chatting stream.
I'm just being down bad.
What the fuck?
I'm so sorry.
And then we can kiss it
to make it better, right?
Of course!
That would be very nice.
I feel really bad
because I have been streaming
for almost an hour
and I still didn't start playing the game.
Please tell me
if you want me to start the game.
Don't worry, you can tell me.
We like the chatting.
Please just talk more.
Yeah, I think you speak.
I know, but I'm supposed to play the game.
Whenever you want, don't worry.
I guess I'm scared
because I've been yapping for like an hour.
Almost an hour.
So I'm like, I know.
Also it's getting pretty hot in here.
Let me turn on my fan.
I feel better already.
Sorry, it was getting really hot in my room
so I had to turn my fan on.
And by fan, I mean you.
You're the fan that I turn on.
Fuck, I'm so cringe!
I'm so cringe.
What the fuck is my problem?
I need to turn my fan on.
My...
my small cringe wife!
Oh no.
RIS 100.
More like RIS minus 100.
That's how I feel right now.
You're very good at it.
Thank you, I'm glad you think so.
Okay, I can defend on what I see.
No, it's so over.

They did not just ask for bunks on the ass, while I guess I don't call it bunks, you know, I call it like spanks.
Oh my god.
I said we're gonna need to move to another site in this raid.
Oh no, no, no, bro, imagine.
Okay, listen, imagine I get fucking demonetized tomorrow
because of this fucking stream.
Imagine the demonetization stream celebration, oh my fucking god.
I love this cob, I love this mister.
No stopping, is that for another session of fun?
Okay, let's fucking go.
Oh, we love, we all love this cob and I love all of you.
Same for us though.
I'm flattered, really, I'm flattered that you can feel that way about me even though I'm being so fucking cringe most of the time.
And weird, I don't know.
YouTube, here's your monetization, reviews later stream.
Our second thought, let me get that back.
Bro, that would be so fucking bad.
That's why we're here.
Why?
Why are you here?
What is my problem?
Not me, literally asking you.
Okay, well why are you here?
Why are you here?
Just to suffer.
Why are you just to suffer?
That's terrible, I didn't want to suffer, I didn't want to be happy.
Holy fuck, for you Brad, that's so sweet.
Because you're unhinged, I'm glad you like how unhinged I am, thank you.
Why are we still here just to tease Icy?
I mean, that's fun.
We're here for Icy, let's be real.
I think that's very sweet if you are here for me because you genuinely like my company and like hanging out with me.
That is like the best compliment to be honest.
Because you know, some people only watch some stuff or only specific content that you make.
So when people like watch everything that you do because they genuinely like you and like your personality and everything around it, then that is like I feel like the best like biggest form of like a compliment for me.
So for those of you that are here and you know, say that you are here for me and stuff and all of that, thank you.
I really do appreciate it because it means a lot to me.
It means a lot to me and that's what I always wanted to be honest.
But I always wanted, like I always really wanted to, you know, people watch my streams and be here no matter what I do, you know, no matter if I play a game or just stock for people to be here because they genuinely just like my company, you know.
And that really means a lot to me because for me it's like whenever I stream, you know, it's like time for us to all like have fun.
Have some quality time together and hang out and do fun stuff and talk and, you know, so I really like it.
You make everything fun.
Oh, thank you.
I'm flattered, really, thank you.
And you're watching, you know, I'm sure I'm best to be here for streams.
Oh, thank you, but don't feel pressured.
Please don't feel pressured to be here.
You know, only be here if you genuinely want to, like don't be here because you feel bad for me or something, I guess, you know.
I could listen to you all day.
Oh, that's really sweet.
I'm glad to hear that.
I only get to every stream, I'll put stream on my cars because if I gotta, oh, the dedication, that's so sweet.
I want to be here.
I'm glad, I'm glad to hear that.
Done.
Let me drink some water.
My throat is getting a little bit sore from all the talking.
I wasn't expecting to be talking this much.
Like that wasn't the plan, but you make it so fun, you know.
You genuinely make it so fun to talk, like I could just talk and talk.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm glad to hear that.
That's much better.
I really needed that water.
Drink slowly, Princess.
I'm sorry, I was, I was so fricking thirsty.
I didn't realize how thirsty I was until I started drinking the water.
So I started fucking chugging it.
This is why I'm here.
Too wild, listen to me, drink water.

Not beating the peeler allegations. Oh, no
Your point being I
Forgot
I forgot what was my what was the point I'm trying to get with I forgot what I said to be honest. Oh
No, my memory is
bad
Why is my memory so f***ing bad?
What the f***
I was literally just talking about it. What was I talking about?
Um
Of the icinate, I guess
But but what was I talking about specific?
F***
F***
Hell
We're a digit as f***, but we're also very wholesome. I feel like that's the best honestly
That's the best right like it's not just me or things that right like
Like it like if you're a digit at the generate, but you're also like wholesome and
and
Like and at the generate was in love, you know
Like that's like the best
To the sides of the same coin. Yeah, exactly best combo. Yeah, I agree
It's so cute how hype she gets with the yapping I can't help it. I'm genuinely like
I'm genuinely just having so much fun. Just talking to you right now
Not gonna lie. I'm just having fun
Talking to you and I'm responding to you and just
Just hanging out
Just talking about
Whatever whatever comes next, I guess
It's fun talking to you too. I'm glad you think so
I'm glad you think so, but I but I will admit like I do feel a bit bad, but I just still didn't start playing like I don't want to be annoying
What comes next? I mean, hopefully you
Hopefully you
You first no, no you first
Thank you for no
No you first
Why not both at the same time?
Okay, that would be that would be ideal. Yeah, that would be ideal
No you first
We gotta take care of our baby. Oh, that's really sweet both
Both is good
No you
No you come first
No you come first
Together just feels better. Yeah, that is true
That is like that's like that would be like so romantic right that would be like peak romance
But I feel like that's also like
Difficult to make it happen
I
Just be like wouldn't that be like difficult to make it happen
Countdown no
My god, what are we talking about this is fucking youtube
Not if you know the right spells, well, what what are the right spells?
Please do tell me I'm very I'm very intrigued
If you love the person and I feel make it work. Okay, that's also true. I agree with that
It does require some good timing
I
Mean there is no alternative not so for extremely sorry for viola right not at the moment, but
The plan is to have that like to have like another platform
For you know when we want to get like extra unhinged
I said that as if I'm not being unhinged already like right fucking now with talking about all this stuff
You'd be surprised what love based will power can do I agree the power of love is is truly strong
Sorry I keep muting myself I keep like having to clear my throat
The f1 or the c1
The the f1 the f1 I believe
I feel like I feel like the plan is definitely like the f1
That's the best part clearing throat ASMR is it I feel like that's
I feel like that's like not a pleasant sound to listen to like just hearing clear my fucking throat like
Whenever I play a game like I can't mute myself
So you do hear and clear my throat a lot, but
While we're chatting I can actually mute myself like when they clear my throat. So I guess it's like
The nice thing but I don't know if it's I don't know if I need to clear my throat so much because I talk so much
Like is that I feel like that's part of it like when I don't talk I don't feel like I need to clear my throat this often
Wait, this is not your full power. No, it's not
I become much much more
Powerful this is not my final form
I see needs to take up her power limiter I will eventually I will I will eventually
I mean I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine
I
Mean I'm already doing like a lot of stuff that you know, I really did not think I would be doing so
That's already like
A big thing on its own for myself
It's time to go even further behind. Yes, I agree
She will distress when her power is unleashed. Okay, I'll be honest. I don't know if that's even true
I don't know if it's even true because okay to be honest like like, yeah, you know, I
Like yeah, that's the plan to like have some streams like on the other side
The f side
Side fuck. I can't talk but like like realistically speaking the way that I know myself
I will be fine
I will be really fucking shy like I really don't know how what's gonna happen
Because I will be I feel like I'll be like
Really like extra shy and stuff because it's like
it's very different than
When you just record yourself and you're not talking to anyone
You know
So
I don't know how good it's gonna be like I don't even know what to expect like I don't even know what's gonna happen
I will be I will say that because
You know for all I know I would get so shy that like my body just fucking freezes, you know
Like that could happen as well. Who knows
So I don't want to like make any promises like I don't want you to have like high expectations of me
When it comes to that because again, I don't know how my body's gonna react like
When stuff like that actually will happen
Because I might just get so shy and nervous that it just frees up
So I feel like it will probably just like
Lead up to it maybe
With with time or stuff like that
It's okay, just do what you feel comfortable with doing
Thank you. Thank you for being understanding about that
Oh, it's all good got your own pace
Yeah, thank you
Thank you for being understanding about it and
Not like I guess pressuring me about it because
Because you know like
Being pressured about it would just like make it a lot worse and make the anxiety like
Even more about
Just do what makes you comfortable. I see. Yeah, I I will I will
Because if I'm not comfortable then
It's it's not gonna be good for anyone
Oh, these things will make you feel comfortable. That's that's what I'm hoping for
That's what I'm hoping for like
Like in the ideal scenario like
Even if I am nervous
And really shy about it
You'll be able to like
Make me really comfortable about it
And stuff like that, but the things you say to me and how how sweet you are to me
That's I guess that's like what I'm hoping for but I get I don't know how I'm going to react
I'll be by your side supporting your art, baby. Oh, that's really sweet
I can imagine here ice using an ice cube
I'm going to have to throw a sickie or something for that first f stream if I am at work
Oh, wow the dedication. Oh my god, that would be so funny imagine. I'm like announcing
My first like f stream
And all of you just take a day of work in that fat
Oh my god, that would be fucking crazy
The amount of dedication is insane
We'll need the whole day maybe a week
A whole week
Let's go
One week stream on the f side
Oh god
I have some overtime saved up so I could take a day off or two
That's nice
Worth it
A lot of us would definitely do it if needed
I feel like that's I feel like that's pretty pretty cute like pretty sweet, you know
If you would like take the day off just for that, you know, that's really sweet
Woo f side and stream
Oh, no
You always speaking speaking of f side speaking of f side, you know what I want to do eventually
You know what I want to do eventually I want to like do like a spankathon or something like that
like I want to get a paddle and
For like every like tip or something I just smack myself
In the bot but like a paddle
So it would be like a spankathon
I always thought like that would be like a really fun idea
Send it send what
Send what
You might break. I don't know. I'm I think I can do it
I think I can do it
Oh, that sounds nice. It sounds fun, right?
Right like that's it's fun
Like like before I even like joined the allure. I actually like wrote
In my application when they asked about like
Ideas I was actually like
I think it would be really cool if we did like a spankathon or something like that
So I already like back then like already like I had the idea to do it send it do it
Okay, well, I'm sorry. Okay. I'm dumb sometimes you say stuff and I don't know what you mean. Okay. I'm sorry. Okay
This is a premium idea. Thank you. I'm glad you think so
I think that would be really fun
and then you'll get to
hear me just
suffer and
Smack my bottoms
Until they sting so much
It's unbearable
I think a few jissens would go overboard
I will need to think smartly about it like
I will need to think smartly about it definitely can't it can't cannot
Be one dollar because I would fucking die like like assuming that people like will go crazy
I don't want to risk that you know, I don't want to risk that you know
Like I would just spankathon, but I also want to like
Be able to still sit on my ass after it, you know
I don't know what I mean
What's the minimum
I don't know
Honestly, I have no idea. I'm scared like I generally don't know what would be like
A minimum for that. I'm I'm scared of making it like too low and then like someone just goes fucking crazy
You know like that would be so bad
Okay, but what's it like this spankathon if you can sit right after well if I can't sit
Like for a few days because of it that means I can't really string because I'll be like
paying from sitting
One of the other girls may have some thoughts. Yeah
Okay, you're right. Yeah, that is true. I could ask I could probably ask scrawny about it and ask her
Opinion what she thinks would be good
That's not a bad idea at all
Here's your tip
Thanks for your tip
Thanks, you know what I
Very nice
Oh
My god
Your floating skills are amazing. Are you being sarcastic? I I can't tell if you're being sarcastic
Or if you genuinely mean it. I I can't tell if you're just being sarcastic when you say that
He may be sarcastic, but I mean it
But mean what
That I have Riz or do you mean something else? No, he's genuine. Really? Do you think so?
She has accidental Riz
Uh, apparently according to you
You could do light slabs for low amounts and heavier ones for big donuts. Oh, that's actually
That's something to think about wait
Wait, that is something to think about that's actually maybe that would be a good idea
Hmm, is it a good idea? What what do the rest of you think about it?
Do you think it's a good idea if for light slabs
For low amounts and heavier ones for big donuts?
Like like if it's like a low amount like a smaller amount I slap it with my hand and
And if it's like a high amount I slap it with like an actual like
paddle
You know like an actual like paddle that will like hurt
Definitely better than a heavy slap for all donuts. Yeah, I think maybe that would make it more fun too
I don't know
Hahaha
Sounds fun sounds good
What is going on just got back from dinner? Oh god
um
Um
I mean, I don't even know how to tell you
Someone someone let let him know
Someone let him know what we're talking about because because I don't know how to
I don't know how to easily explain
Kino stream brainstorming and flirting session
Spanko who's gonna tell him does he know
Does he know
Oh
My god
He doesn't know no he doesn't
Only the real ones will know this
Guys remind me again that we went to a gameplay stream to a zazoo to spank
Yes, we did and you know what I think that's amazing
I think that's amazing
I love that we can just do whatever I love that we can just do whatever I love that
We can just talk
And and have fun doing just that
You know, I think it's really nice
I
See still confused, but I see wait, what what are you confused about like?
What what are you exactly confused about?
This is why I do my best to tune in live whenever I can
Yeah, because because if you're not if you're not here when it's live
Then you know, you you will feel like the
FOMO
Really hard I guess and I feel bad for it because like I know there's people who like want to watch
Me live, but they can't because of time zones and schedules and stuff
And I feel so sad for them, you know, like it makes me sad because it's like
It's like fuck. I wish I could like just make everyone happy, you know, but I know that
realistically I
I can't do that. I can do my best to try and make
Many happy I guess but
I can I'm not going to be able to appeal to like every single person
Sadly, like, you know, I wish I could but
uh
I'm just a tiny little cop who is trying her best

Is that I can make people laugh
That was like the only one compliment that I remember like getting throughout like my whole life
So that's nice
VTubers always say never to go parasocial to them, but what if they're the ones who are parasocial

Oh boy, I don't think I'll ever like get used to it. It's it's it's crazy
Kiss the stitches better. Yeah
I
Have you increased your fun time in the past week? I mean, yeah, usually I only have like
quote unquote
fun time like once or twice a month
at most
But because of you I have been like in heat like basically every day, so
I
What's the number so far, I don't know I don't fucking count
I don't I don't I don't sit there with like a piece of paper and like
Writing every time I jerk off. I don't do that. I just
What
I don't fucking know
I love these streams so much. I'm I'm glad I I enjoy being here
Month I could never
You don't keep a tally is on a normal what is a tally?
What is a tally is it like a jerk off diary or something am I like missing something?
That much, huh? Yeah, that much that I don't I can't keep count of it
Tell is just a count while I don't keep counts like I said, I just do it
Tell is just so for something that keeps count. Okay, that's good to know
I'm I'm learning new words every day. Thanks to you
I
Definitely
I I genuinely don't know like I I genuinely don't know I just know that it's
been more than
Like more than any months that I have like in the past that's all I know
I
Will question I see how often is too often. I don't know
I genuinely don't know
I wish I could give you like an actual answer, but I genuinely don't know
Polar Bearstone hibernate. Yeah, that's true
It's important to keep count especially around tax season. What the fuck does me jerking off has to do with tax season
What are they gonna tax me for jerking off multiple times a day?
No
The fuck are you talking about?
Polar Bear's pay taxes, no
They don't but that's why I'm happy. I have daddy
Cause daddy can pay my taxes for me
You guys haven't paid your shark tax yet
First time I've ever been happy about my career short
Wait, why wait? I'm stupid. I don't understand what you mean. Wait. What do you say that?
Why would you say that?
I see tax
A pay in white money come money
Wait, which tax are we paying the come tax?
I
Rest knocking on your door right now
But imagine if you don't pay your taxes what happens is the irx irs
Knocks on your door, and they just start fucking gang banging you
I
Know that's like the first thing that came to my mind
When when one of their gsads was talking about like the irs knocking on the door
First thought was
Wait, why are they knocking on the door just because I jerk off multiple times a day?
Is that how you pay them the taxes? Is it like
Fucking
I'm sorry
Is how you don't pay taxes in the hopes they restart
Running a train
No
No, I I I will only have a train with my daddy's
Only only train of love here no iris trains allowed
Only train of love with with gsads who are truly in love with me
This dream is fucking perfect. I see thank you
I I generally was not expecting to like go live and just fucking talking on stop, but
It just naturally happened so
And i'm having fun so like you know, why should why should I stop doing it?
You know if i'm having fun, why should I stop having fun when I can just keep on having fun?
Bro that was like the dumbest shit i've said in a while the fuck was that
Ah
If you really love someone you pay their cop tax
I don't even know what game you were gonna play
And it says in the title it says in the title the name of the game that I was gonna play
Now that's my next step to wait, what's your next step?
It's time to work on obtaining through jesus pretty

Ah
That's what happens when you're having a great time with your mistress just do what feels natural
And stays in tos. I mean
I mean about the tos part, I don't know
Ah, I don't know how well I did there. Let's be honest, but I'm just having so much fun. I can't stop myself
Wait, did we unlock some new dlc? Wait, what do you mean?
I don't know if icy can stay in tos
Honestly same, not today anyways
Not today anyways. I just can't stop fucking yapping because i'm having so much fun

Okay, real you're not wrong. That's very fucking true
I just can't stop
You have stream is great is it like
You don't think it's like boring like you don't think it's boring to just like hear me like fucking talk non-stop

I'm just imagining and something else i'm imagining that it's your
Coming

Uh the baby bottle i ordered a baby bottle
Uh
If only you could actually have it true pain
New SMR triggers whoo i mean
I don't know if a baby bottle is gonna sound any different than the pacifier
Because they're both like made from the same material
Right
So i don't think it's gonna make a different sound unless like i tap on the bottle or something
When the fans are more to us friendly than the streamer, okay, that's that's what it feels like
That's what it feels like
Uh
In 2036 you can have vr e sex with o g sends

A balanced amount of stupid
Should be okay if we don't go overboard with it
McDonald's like
Double in price the past two years
Okay, real
True
I see for a president should make inflation disappear. I don't think that someone as stupid as me
Should be a president to be honest

You know the mouth tracking isn't the best though
I will say that
Like the mouth tracking has some problems like I had to
Play with it a lot to like get it to
Be the way that it is right now like it was I don't know if you remember but I think in my debut
My mouth tracking was even worse
So I had to like figure out like how to like make it at least a bit better
It's so funny though when your mouth is open wide while drinking right it is
It looks it whenever I drink water it looks like I'm waiting for you to
Shoot your shot
And my mouth

Well, I don't care how much we're just full of
Full of life what?
Don't knows I see
Oh my god
Fuck uh panda jeff. Thank you so much for the $10 donation. I see ice cream fun. Thank you
I'll definitely buy myself some of the nice sneakers ice cream that I love so much. Thank you
Oh jeez sometime, please. I'm begging you. Please. Please stop with the $100 donation. You're the freaking
You're the freaking kill me
Snickers ice cream fun for baby gives me $100 like
Please you already donated more than enough. Please. Thank you so much
Thank you. I really appreciate it
I see hold me. I'm confused. Thank you anonymous for the $100
Thank you so much anonymous. I appreciate that
Uh qb I blink and suddenly yandere bear arc happens. Thank you for the $10 tip
I'm not a yandere. I'm not a yandere though like the I don't think I don't think I am
like
Like I wouldn't like murder anyone. I wouldn't like kill anyone
If you cheat on me, I will just be really uh
I'll just be really heartbroken
and sad and depressed and cry
and then I'll be pissed off for a while and
just completely like
delete your existence
Like from my mind and not interact with you in any fucking way
I
Get just just like normal people. Yeah, I think that's normal, but like I
I wouldn't kill anyone, you know, I wouldn't like murder anyone over it
That would hurt even worse
I mean, yeah
Yeah
What kind of dare do you think you are?
Um, I'm actually not sure
I'm actually not sure because
I'm really bad at like understanding my personality
like
I don't know if that makes sense, but I find it like hard to understand
What kind of person I am it's a lot easier for me if people tell me
How they see me
Because whenever people ask me stuff like oh, what's your personality like or
What type like this and this are you and I'm like
I genuinely don't know because I feel like I have sometimes like
different like
qualities of different personalities
And you know, it changes on like the situation and the people I'm around with, you know
So it's for me. It's hard to tell what I'm like
and
It's easier if people just tell me how they see me, I guess
And go from that
That's normal, it's almost impossible to know yourself with people showing you the person they seen you. Yeah, I feel like it's
I think it's like pretty like complicated for me to
Like I've always had a problem with that to be honest like I never was
I don't know. It's just complicated
I saw whole horn. Thank you so much for the $10 donation
After my trial where I was found to not be the cheater. I would like to demand
Reparations for this wrongful accusation in the form of free isenate. That is all oh and I see
Thank you so much. Thank you for the $10 donation
I literally already gave isenate yesterday. Come on like
Come on. You had it yesterday. You can
You can't wait a day without it. You don't need it every fucking day
Personality quiz stream when okay, so
My personality like you know, there's like that one big test
um
That everyone takes to like know your personality type
uh, so
I don't
Let me look up
Uh
I don't know if that helps or not, but uh
My personality type is uh, I
nfp
But apparently there's like two
Apparently there's like two different, uh
Like sub categories to that personality as well
Uh, and I can't remember which sub type I am
Uh, I can't remember
What's the difference between the
Two types of them. I can't remember which which one I am, but uh
nfp
Types
Where is where is uh
Sorry, I'm trying to google it
What is uh
And what is so there is I nfp a
And there is I nfp
I nfp t
So there's like two different ones
and
I don't remember which
One I am to be honest
So
So yeah, I I I don't
I don't remember
I know like that like generally that I am I nfp like I've taken the test
Quite of times
Uh before so like it's confirmed like it's confirmed confirmed that that's my personality type because I've taken that that's like
many times
In my life
But yeah, I'm very like
Emotion like driven and
Like creativity driven and
All that stuff and yeah
Pretty sure I'm I and
GT
Oh man, there's I I don't even I would have to like
Google all this
There's I n t j
And there is I
And j t
Right like those are two different ones
Can you draw or paint well, um
I used to draw a lot as a kid
I would like whenever I would watch cartoons and stuff. I would get like paper
And try to draw as I was like watching the cartoon and stuff like that
And and eventually I got pretty decent at it and
You know, I was drawing more and stuff like that and
And then like at some point in my life, I did a lot of stuff related to
Related around art like I was there was like this one time that I
went to like
I volunteered at like a gallery
and
And I had like one like some
I had some of my I used to like do photography stuff as well. So I used to have like
Some of my photography on like the gallery
exhibition
That I was like
Created I was like a curator of that exhibition with some other girls
We were like in the group and so I was like contacting like
multiple photographers that I really
love their photography and so
We had like an exhibition in that gallery and then
And then another time I
I made like
some art and
And I had it like in a museum
exhibition
And that was like a big thing for me like I remember like both of my parents
Coming to the museum
Back then to look at it and and I was feeling like really proud and happy and my parents were like
Wow, look at her go. She she has her art like in the museum exhibition and I was like
I was so happy that uh
I was able to make them
And proud
And any chance they're still there, they're not because you know, it was it was an exhibition and you know exhibitions are like usually
They're there for like
A certain amount of time
And then you know, they change them
Like there's museums where it's like, you know permanent like stuff and then they
Sometimes hold exhibitions
And stuff like the world famous artists. I said nothing else. Nah
I'm not not anything like that. Not anything like that, but
But back then I was yeah back then I was like really
back then
That was like my big thing back then I was hoping to like
Focus on art and
And make like a career out of it, but
uh
But then eventually I realized that like it's not for me because like there was a time when I
would take um
commissions for art
and
And basically from that experience I
I realized that
it's it's not
It's it's not for me, you know, I rest it's not for me because whenever someone would commission me I
I would uh
I would get really anxious like I would get really anxious and nervous and
You know overthink like
Every line that I do I would constantly be
Scared and nervous that it's gonna look like shit or that it's not gonna be good enough and
And so because of the commissions is actually why I stopped like
drawing like
Because
It it was no longer like a fun thing for me to do
It was just like something that made me feel like all these negative emotions
And when I was a kid
And before that like I used to just draw
To like express myself or like draw things that I like or
um
I mean my art was like
Pretty pretty weird let's put it that way because
It was something like I remember um
At school I I used to like take uh
I majored like art and like
like
school and
They had like this like big exam thing
Where they give you like
um
Like a really big art project to work on
and then like
If you like art teachers like check it and
You know they give you like a score based of it and all that stuff and
um
basically my project
um for that was
Just mainly like
My my art project was uh
Based on the different parts of my personality
So I basically drew like a couple of different artworks that I felt
Showcased and represented like parts of my personality and different sides of me
So some of them would be like really weird or morbid
Some of them would even like include like
Like portraits of like people that meant a lot to me
Some of them would include like something
More like cute and stuff like that
And you know it was like kind of over the place but surprisingly uh
Surprisingly I got like the highest score
I got I got surprisingly the highest score in that exam out of
Everyone and I remember um
The person who was like, you know giving the scores and checking it telling me that
Like I don't know that I was like
Extremely creative or something like that and
I don't know
Stuff like that, but you know eventually with time
uh, I just started like
Uh
Doing art less and less, you know like uh
I'm I'm just all about making shitty ugly doodles with my fucking mouse
At this point of my life because it's stress-free. It's it's funny. It's stress-free. It's funny. I
If it looks like shit, it makes it even funnier. So I don't know. It's it's just not really
Not really my thing anymore, you know sometimes sometimes
As you grow up like you're still trying to figure out yourself, right?
So there will be times when like you've had hobbies that you
Were extremely
passionate with and
That you really thought you're going to make like a career out of them or something and then
As time goes by and like different things happen to you in life and you gain different experiences like
You know, sometimes you just don't feel anything about
Those hobbies anymore. They don't make you happy anymore
So that's I guess that's kind of how it was for me for me and learn
I just like making ugly funny silly doodles with my mouse and
That's that's the enjoyment. That's like the most enjoyment that I get out of
Making art if you can call it that
Um, but if you want, uh, I could show you like I have um, I actually have some of the art
That I made for that big art project exam back then. I have some
Pictures of it
I could show you but I also don't want to like weird you out. It's like because like I don't know
I don't know if like the art that I made back then like would make you like think weirdly of me because
Some of it is like really weird or maybe like
I don't know. I don't know
I don't know. That was just really something
Art is subjective weird way. Yeah art is
Art is art like it can be anything and
A way to express yourself
Oh, please. I would love to see
um
Maybe maybe I will I will show it eventually
Well, I'll have parts of our past that no longer apply but still explain how we got to where we are. Yeah, I think that's definitely true
I I definitely agree like
They were like part of
Like our
development as
A person
You know
That's why I also think that like if like
Maybe you if someone like did do something bad in the past
And and I'm not talking about like extremes here
Like, you know, but I'm talking about like
You know, like more generally like speaking stuff
Uh
Fuck what am I even trying to say? I'm just trying to say that like it's
It's part of your growth and and it's part of your growth and at the end of the day
What I think really really matters at the end of the day
is that
You you strive to be a better person and that you
You know want to be better and
you know like
That like you are self aware. I think self awareness is very important
I don't know if that makes sense what I'm trying to say
I'm kind of just yapping
around and
Basically don't focus too much on what you did in the past
And just have self aware awareness to know that like, yeah
You know what I did back then was like really shitty or really bad and I don't want to ever do that again
I don't I don't want to be that person or
Stuff like that and just like
Make growth
out of that
I don't know why I'm talking about that. I feel like it's so weird that I'm talking about this stuff right now. I'm sorry if it's like
Really like too serious or like a really weird thing to talk about. I don't
Uh, I'm just like I'm just rambling honestly at this point
Learn from the past grow as a person. Yeah, exactly
I think I think the end goal is
To be the best version of yourself that you can be
and
And as I always say
as I always say
Being your authentic self
easier ideal self
I don't know. I I just I don't keep repeating that quote, but
Whenever I get insecure or
nervous I
I keep reminding it to myself
And
Is this how the pillow talk is gonna be like
I don't know. I don't know
Uh, I don't know if it's weird that I'm talking about all this stuff. I'm sorry if it is
Not weird at all it helps us to understand and connect more with you. I'm glad to hear that. That's that's really nice
Honestly, I love it. No, I'm really glad to hear that
Just be the best you can be. Yeah, pretty much
Yeah, I second that. Yeah
You learn more from a mistake
That that a job will do most of the time. Yeah
That that is true and you also
you also learn from
Actual experience as well, you know
It's fine. I see just be safe and no docs. Okay, I'm not doxing myself. I'm not like
I'm not giving you
I'm not giving you my address or nothing. I'm just talking about like my
My life and
How I am and just
For you to get a better idea of
What I am as a person, I guess
It's just really nice to be able to talk about this stuff to be honest
Oh, oh my god
Vatams, thank you so much for the 99
Darts, thank you. Thank you so much
That's really sweet. Take these
Authentic 99 bingo box seriously though. Good talk. I see love
Oh, that's so sweet
Oh
Kind minister love. Thank you so much. I
I just this feels so spoiled. That's
It's it's a weird feeling
We know just be safe, you know, we still want you here. Yeah. Yeah, I I know I I try to be as
As good as I can be about my
Uh, what's the word ops?
Ops bag
Ops bag. I don't remember something about that
And we enjoy spoiling you so it works
Yeah, but like the thing is you enjoy spoiling me but
I I sometimes like feel like guilty and like
Like bad and you know about it because I'm like
I don't feel like I I deserve like I really didn't do much, you know, like I didn't I don't know
You
Make us feel so good that we want to make you feel good in return. Oh, that's really sweet
All of you really make me happy like genuinely
I I can't remember exactly but
Uh, I can't remember exactly what she be was talking about in one of her streams
I think maybe yesterday, but
She was saying something that
I felt a similar way about you know, like like, you know how sometimes like I get worried and I'm like
You know like overthinking stuff overthinking the future and
And just like think about it too much. I'm like like I feel a similar way that
She be does in the sense that like
I just I just want everyone to
To be happy, you know and like
And like
Some of us are like really deep in it
More and more every day and
And like that part is scary when I overthink it overthink it because I think about the future and I'm like
I don't I don't want to hurt anyone, you know, like at the end of the day
I want everyone to be happy and I guess when I think about the future it scares me because I
I don't want to
Break anyone's heart, you know, I don't
I I want everyone to be happy, you know and
And
When you get like so deep in it like you can't help but
Think about the future and like overthinking and be like
Uh think about like what ifs or
And I'm trying not to think like that, you know, I'm trying not to think like that
I'm trying to really just live in the moment and
And enjoy the present because that is
That is exactly the best way to live, right? But when you are
In it like really deep it it feels really difficult not to think about that stuff
Like I don't know so I guess it's like I don't know I don't know what I'm
I don't even know what like the point I'm trying to make is honestly, I just
I don't know. I just I just want everyone to be happy and I
And it's scary, you know scared because I'm I'm scared of anyone ever like
Getting hurt or anything like that like
I don't know
I don't know how how to word it
but
basically
Yeah a similar feeling to
What she be was talking about yesterday. I think it was yesterday. Um
No, it wasn't yesterday or was it
I don't I don't remember there was like a stream where she talked about something similar and
I was like, yeah like
Sometimes I would think that and I'm trying my best not to I really am
Trying to you know
Just enjoy the present but
It's so difficult, you know
It's it's so difficult like not think about it, you know
Like because you don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. You want everyone to be happy
Like I generally want
Everyone that's been really kind and sweet to me have
a really good life and
Be happy, you know like and
It would just feel so horrible to like hurt anyone and
Because I don't know
Feelings I feel
Just gonna randomly end the stream again and exit obs because I feel
I feel
I understand always be here and it's okay. I know what you mean. Yeah
How how does one
Not think about it. How does one just
Stop worrying about it like how do you even do that?
I feel bad like this is like this is like a heavy conversation we're having and I feel like really bad
I
Feelings are complicated and love especially but it's all worth it. Yeah, it is complicated
Uh, I couldn't answer that alone, but I feel
The way I feel
Uh, no point to do me when you can be blooming
Uh
True
True
I don't know if it gives an anime
I'm sorry, but I feel my emotions extremely strong
I don't think because an anime would like fix my fucking
Depression if I got like extremely fucking sad or something happened, you know
That would like
That would be like sad
I'm happy as long as I seen is happy
And I'm happy as long as you're happy
Sorry
I love you even if I can't be there next to you
I never thought I could be the spur of social before I started watching
You uh, I
That's really sweet. I I I actually feel the same way like I never
Felt like this before, you know
Like in my past
When I did stream like I never felt like
Like this much like this is like a whole like another
10 20 like levels of it, you know what I mean like it's it's like completely different than like anything I've ever experienced so
So yeah, it's
It's it's really something
I don't think you can stop the emotion
You just have to take the good and bad as they are. Yeah
That's true
Do you make this mister feel like a teenager in love again?
The ultimate fountain of youth
That's really sweet actually
I think I think it's really sweet when some of you say that like
Stuff like that like, you know like
Make you feel young again or like
bring youth or
Stuff like that. I think that's really sweet
It's because of the nature of not say for not say for work work. I I disagree
I
Don't think that's why
I don't think that's why and I'll tell you why I used to
Before I even started v2 being
I used to do
Only fans
I used to do only fans for a few years and
You know like taking like pictures of myself
and like some cosplays and
stuff like that and
I never felt that way with like anybody, you know like the people who would
message me, you know
Or stuff like that like
I I never
I never felt like per social with them
So I don't I don't think it's I don't think it's because of the nature
of the
not say for work
Thing because even when
I did like not say for work content before vlr
I never felt like per social with
For the people, you know what I mean
Like I never felt like this. So with you it's like it's completely different
Only pause
It's about the authenticity of the interactions between parties maybe yeah, I think that's what it is because like
because like
Right now like it's not just it's not just like
sexual stuff, right like
We we spend time together like we talk about
actual like
You know life we we talk about deeper things sometimes we
You see me stream and just be my silly funny self and
And stuff like that like you're getting to know like the actual like person on a deeper level, you know
and
And I think that's like where
Those kind of stuff start to develop
Like if it's just if it's just actual then like
I don't know
It doesn't like
Like I need to have emotions basically I need to have emotions for like
Like the whole sex thing to be like
You know like I wanted to mean something. I don't want it to be just like
Whatever, you know
That's why that's why when like people ask me about like tributes or stuff like that
You know the sexual ones
I'm like
only only if you love me and
only if you don't
flirt with other girls because to me like
uh
those are like a form of
intimacy
That you share with one another in a special way. So like if someone sends me a tribute
And there's no message attached to it and it's just like
A random dick joking off like
It genuinely doesn't do anything for me. Like I don't feel anything. I don't fucking I don't care
You know what I mean
And also to clarify also to clarify another thing like you can
I think I think people are misunderstanding some stuff. I think there is like a misunderstanding
You know like you can still watch
like the other
Like my gen mates and stuff or like support them like of course like they're amazing
What what we don't want what we don't want you to do is to
say like
Oh, I love you. Oh, I'm in love with you. You know, oh, I want to be with you. Oh, I'm in love with you
And and you're my favorite or and then you go and like same the same shit
To all the other girls like that's that's just fucking stupid. Just don't say it at all at that point
like
Just stop, you know, it's like specifically about
tributes and
You know flirting and I know we're supposed to be like
A horpo, but for me specifically like
Like I'm not gonna lie like I am getting very I am getting like very attached, you know
I can't help my feelings like
I I didn't plan for this to happen
Like I'll I I'll be honest like when I joined I my plan was to just be purely sexual and
like
not
You know not not care about those kind of stuff and
Not not like let it mean anything, you know just purely sexual, you know
but
But you're all like so kind and sweet to me and just such amazing people that like
We just we just naturally like started getting closer and closer and
so
So yeah, so basically
uh
How do I how do I say it in in a way that is not misunderstood
Uh just
Just don't be stupid
Just just just don't lie. Just don't lie. Just don't
Don't say things that you don't mean, you know
Like don't don't go into a girl's
Freaking stream and be like, oh, you're my favorite. Oh, I love you
I'm genuinely so in love with you
I have feelings for you and I think about you and blah blah and then
And then you go to like all the other girls and you go and say the same shit
Or or something similar
like
Just just be a decent person and just
Don't say that if you don't mean it
Don't say things that you don't mean basically. It's really that simple. Honestly. It's really not that difficult just
Just don't say that stuff, you know, if you don't mean it, you know
You can still you can still be a decent person and watch all of us and support all of us and be a decent person about it, you know
I feel like it's really simple to do that
Do many people do that? I don't know but like
But there was like one person like on twitter. I think I don't know if some of you saw it
I think you saw it because like I add mercy about it
On twitter and I was like, there's a fucking cheater in here
Bro, it's like telling me this mister loves you so much and then he has this fucking oshi mark of mercy
like bro
Have some like
tagged
Like hello
I hate that shit like genuinely. I genuinely hate that shit. It pisses me off so much
Like what the fuck is your problem?
Like what
What I just I just don't get it. I personally personally I don't get it. I don't
If you don't mean something just don't say it. It's
I don't know. I'm probably like overreacting honestly
I'm probably overreacting
And stuff and I'm sorry if I am
But I felt like it was like a big thing to touch subject on
You know
as
You know
I I didn't plan to feel the way that I do, you know the plan was to keep it purely sexual but
you know
feelings feelings and things change when you know you meet some
decent people that are really sweet to you
And treat you well surprise surprise and then you get attached to them like
That's that happened
You you build
a form connection, you know
Someone told me to check my donations

Oh my god, you're still streaming I know I'm surprised too
I'm surprised too that I'm still streaming. I'll be honest with you
I'm surprised because you know, I usually like just just leave after two hours
Uh, but today's conversations like have just been like so pleasant and
nice

Help you clear those kind of thoughts and it makes me happy when I can affect people
In a positive way. That's really sweet and
Like don't don't worry about like stuff like money or anything. Please again, like I said, it's
No, there's like no pressure. Please always take care of yourself. Um, but I really appreciate the message and
Thank you for the really sweet words
You're gonna change stream title icy deer. I will once I'm done streaming
This is not like twitch where you can just change the title
In the middle of the stream. I don't think
If it is possible
I don't know. I'm scared that it's just gonna make like the stream fucking die or something
Like I don't want a repeat of yesterday where I'm like talking and in the middle of it
Maybe it's fucking dies or something
I think you can actually
Is it is it not gonna like fuck up like the stream or like something?
I feel
Tell me again, how did the stream become is that so
uh because
Because my my sweet
Snowberries are really fun and pleasant to talk to
And I just have so much fun
Talking to them, you know
so
It just naturally developed into is awesome because I love talking to my snowberries
You know, it's it's really that simple
Because she loves this and kept talking. Yeah, exactly like I love talking to you like I'm having so much fun
This is like this is like so great like that's
That's honestly like a big thing that I always wanted to do like I always like
I wanted to be able to like sometimes like have just like
run those
Streams where we just hang out together and talk about like whatever just like relaxing together like not necessarily gaming or anything
Just talking about different subjects and enjoying each other's company, you know
We're more appealing than playing a video game good ego boost
That it is true though
It is true though, like I I have trouble finding games that I enjoy so
Surprise surprise like I actually like
Uh feel like I have a lot more fun just talking to you like today
I
I still love like playing like games on stream don't get me wrong
That's really fun as well because a lot of like funny memes happen out of it, you know a lot of like
You know like things happen during it. So it is fun
Uh, can we do this more often cob? You really make everything better
Sorry, um, yeah, I'll I'll think about it
Maybe
Uh, then tomorrow is a dj stream. No
No, there is no dj stream tomorrow tomorrow is my
Tomorrow we're doing a movie watch along and then after that a members only
Drunk karaoke. That's what's going to happen tomorrow
The watch along is my monetization and membership opening celebration
so
Yeah, and the members only
Drunk karaoke. That's what's happening tomorrow
I love these streams. I'm glad I can't wait to finally remember you
I don't know why that sounded kind of loot to me
That's probably because I'm just have a loot mindset. Sorry
Um
Usually I just sleep till I have to work, but now I have something to look forward to
Oh, I feel the same way though. I feel the same way like every day I wake up
Like so excited, you know, like every day there's like something new and good to look forward to and
That's such a nice feeling, you know, I'm really happy
Okay
It's an eager coded post
Uh, remember tier one is emotes and the rest can get more
perks
Uh, oh Jesus can think of yeah. Yeah. Yeah
Yeah, it just just the same way that strani has it
You know tier one is like for the badges and the emotes and then tier two is for the
Member only streams and stuff like that
So just letting you know in advance that that's how it's gonna work
Except our members
How does strani have it that that's the way the chi has that I believe she has two tiers
Tier one is for emotes and the badges and tier two is for
The members only the streams and other content. I guess depends on what each girl does
Not sure if you saw it by the way, but I suggest earlier that you can do a member stream
Where you doodle us profile pics. Oh, I actually didn't see that. That's a that's a cute idea
Whoa, that's a good idea. Hold on. Let me copy that
Let me copy that in my notes
Real quick
Uh, that's actually a good idea. That would be a really cute member only stream
Making for all of you like your own custom profile picture. That would be so much fun
Whoa, I'm actually super excited to do that
Wow, that would be that would be actually really fun. I would love that like dry custom profile picture
For for all of you that are like members
That will be such a fun stream
Can just yap away while I
Well, I make you funny cute art for you two so it's a perfect picture
Is there gonna be a story in for you, you know
Um, I don't know
I don't know
for now, no, but
Who knows what the future will bring
You know that premium path
Oh my god
Meet and fuck for two
Oh god
Oh no
Not like this
Oh no
I see you're underestimating the member numbers, I think
I mean
I I don't know what to expect to be honest
I uh, you know, like I don't I don't really know what to expect
Tomorrow, so I genuinely have no idea
So because we will see what happens, I don't know
Tier 4 premium path
Every time I think she'll get tired of blue joke she leans into them and then loses it that's that's just the way I am
And and I hope you like it. I hope you love the way that I am
I see battle pass
Oh my god, I see battle pass where you have to like do different quests like every day
To like hit like the max level of the battle pass
Hahaha
I can't think of a handful of names that will be great tomorrow
Oh, I'm sorry like yeah
And your battle pass to grind wink wink. Why would the quest even be?
I wonder
I wonder that's actually pretty funny
That's actually pretty funny to think about like even though it's like as a joke
That would still be like funny to think about it
The daily pass like quests are like
Oh you you have to today one of the quests is like
to send multiple like
audios of yourself or
Or like the next day you you need to draw fan art even even if you think it's gonna be like shitty art
You you still have to draw me even if you draw me as a stick i'm still gonna appreciate it
Because you've put time and effort into it
Uh
Oh
Shit that would actually be cool
I feel like that would be like too much. I don't know
But it's it's a funny concept. It's it's funny as it's like a fun concept to think about it
I don't know joke around about but I feel like in
In reality would be probably too much
I do that battle pass
Yeah, and you would do me as well
Oh no, i'm getting unhinged again. Oh no
Sister well fuck i've been yapping for like
Three hours and a half. What the fuck is my problem?
That's actually awesome, but it would be hard to come up with something every day. Yeah, that too
I
Love how the loot jokes just slip out of you. I see
Yeah, just like your count does out of my
Make sure to have some tea and take care of your voice after stream. Yeah, that's true. I definitely need to
Drink some tea after this stream. I don't remember the last time that I have talked this much non-stop
I genuinely don't remember so I am going to need to get some nice tea and
relax my voice
because
We have tomorrow's stream and i'm doing a karaoke so
So I need to make sure that my voice is still intact for tomorrow
Because I don't want because if I have a sore throat tomorrow and you know
My throat is in pain. I won't be able to do the karaoke and I don't want it to come to that
So no booty stuff? Well, what?
What do you mean?
Huh, what are you talking about?
What are you talking about? I almost want to just talk with people and make quick requests for ourselves
Okay, I really don't want to end this stream right now, but I think I will
Just so that I can save my voice for tomorrow because I can feel like my voice like
Like it's getting harder and harder for me to talk like I can feel my throat like feeling
Uh
Not not not the best right now. So I think it's a sign that I should
Rest and head out so that tomorrow I can
actually
do the
The drunk karaoke and and sing for you and I hope you will enjoy my
singing even if it's not good
and
that you will enjoy
Overall our time together tomorrow because tomorrow we're going to be spending
Even more time together like we spend more time together today, but tomorrow we will spend even more time
together
so yeah
You bless us with a long talking stream
And and you bless me with your amazing company. So thank you
It'll be great just to chill and celebrate your accomplishment. Yeah
I'm really excited
so
As much as much as I want to stay and talk to you more
Because it's been so fun
uh
I will have to head out and get some tea and
Rest my voice so that tomorrow I can I can sing for you
So, uh, thank you so much for being here with me. Thank you for listening to me. Yeah
Thank you for all the donations as well
here
You just spoiled me way too much
Generally, thank you so much. You're all
so sweet so kind I
I'm so lucky to
To have you generally uh
I love you and I will I will see you again tomorrow and tomorrow we will be spending
Much much much more time and we're gonna do lots of fun stuff. So yeah
I'll head off for now and get something. I'm going to miss you
I want to miss you and
Yeah, bye bye for now. I love you
