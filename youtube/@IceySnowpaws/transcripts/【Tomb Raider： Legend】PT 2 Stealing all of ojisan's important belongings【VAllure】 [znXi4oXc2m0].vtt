ვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვ

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Nice! Yay! Nice!

06:13.000 --> 06:20.000
So I can still have a nice wind blowing on me and get extra comfy.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Yay! I'm glad, I'm glad.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Very happy.

06:26.000 --> 06:38.000
The weather is weird, like some days are a bit hotter than others and then some days are actually really nice and have a cold wind and stuff.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
Ah, it's been kind of all over the place.

06:43.000 --> 06:50.000
But I would prefer it for it to be all over the place like this than for it to be like super, super hot.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Like every day I would literally die from heat.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
How are you doing today?

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
I hope you're all doing well.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
I missed you and I'm glad we get to spend more time together.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
And I'm so, so, so excited for Saturday.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
We're going to spend so much time together.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Usually we only spend...

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Usually...

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Ah, I feel better already.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Honestly, same. Me too.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
I'm so happy because usually we spend around like two hours together and stuff.

07:36.000 --> 07:43.000
But this Saturday we can spend like I think like almost five hours together.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
Because like the movie is about like close to three hours, right?

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
And then the karaoke is going to be either one or two hours.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
Depending on my energy.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Depending on like my voice as well, I guess.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
Like if my throat is going to start hurting, I am going to have to cut the karaoke shorter.

08:06.000 --> 08:14.000
But I'll make sure to drink lots of tea and make sure to rest my throat.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
And maybe you can help my throat heal as well.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
It's really hard to stop being unhinged after yesterday.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I feel like I'm on a roll now.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I feel like I'm on a roll. I just can't stop.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I just...

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry for making you feel uncomfortable or like really weird.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
I'm just...

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I just love you and you make me happy.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
So I like being playful with you.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
You know, I like being playful and have fun with you.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
And I can't help it that I like getting you all riled up, okay?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I can't help it.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
I really like doing that.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
It's really nice, you know?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
What? Never uncomfortable?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Okay, that's good.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
I like you being playful with a cup too.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Okay, okay.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
That's...

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Fuck, why can't I talk normally?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
What is my fucking problem?

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
I limited to two hours for regular streams.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
It's not that I'm limited, but like usually after two hours,

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
I get pretty pee around that time.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
Like I could stream for...

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Fuck, I don't want to yawn.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
Fuck, I literally just said...

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
How energized I'm feeling now that I'm here.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
And then you hear me fucking start yawning.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
It's so over, fuck.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
All right, no gaming stream.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
It's time to have a napping stream.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
It's time to go pee.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Napping stream where I just...

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
The snowberries relax you.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
It is true though, you do relax me.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
And you make me happy.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
And I just...

10:35.000 --> 10:41.000
Everyday has been so exciting to wake up to, you know?

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Like everyday has been so fun.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
And honestly, it's my fault that I'm a bit epee today

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
because I didn't take my usual nap.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
Like usually I take a nap before a stream,

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
but I didn't take one today because I...

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I was just like...

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
I was just replying to morows all day, to be honest.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
Like ever since I woke up, I was just replying to morows.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Pretty much the whole day.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
And I still have a backlog.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
I still have a backlog even after like...

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Going through them for like hours, like...

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Because like the thing is, the thing is,

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
when I try to like clear out the backlog,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
whenever I try to clear the backlog,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
usually what happens is I'm like,

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
okay, today is the day I'm clearing my backlog.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
And then I try to do that.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
And then I get like...

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I answer like a question.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
And then like...

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
And then I get like five more morows, you know?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Like remember how I told you,

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
I had like over like a hundred morows?

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Like after I said it, I had like...

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I had like two hundred of them.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And I was like, oh my god,

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
I'm never gonna be able to clear the backlog.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
And it feels so bad because like...

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
Because I want to respond to all of you, you know?

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
And sometimes it's hard.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
So please don't take it too personally.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
If sometimes I only hard what you said,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
or I don't respond,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
or don't respond, I can't talk.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Like I promise it's not a person.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
It's just there's a lot, you know?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
And I really, really try my best

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
to respond to as many people as I can.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
But sometimes there's messages that are like a bit similar.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And I feel really dumb.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I don't know if it's just my bad,

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
but I just feel really dumb.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Like if there's like a few nice messages,

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
you know, they're really sweet.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
I feel really dumb just saying like...

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Thank you for like over like five times,

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
or like repeating myself.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
Because I also don't want to like come across like...

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Like I just respond to everyone the same way, you know?

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
But when you get so many messages like that,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
like you eventually run out of like things

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
or like ways to respond to them.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Just know that I am always very grateful

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
when you send me like really kind mares

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
and you tell me nice things and...

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
And yeah, so if sometimes you don't get a response

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
or you think I didn't see something that you send me,

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
I guess you can always try and send it.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I can't talk!

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
Basically, you could try sending it again,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
because I know like...

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Fuck, what was I going to say?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I was like, I know that!

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
I don't think I know anymore, fuck!

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I don't think I know anymore.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
I feel so stupid, I'm sorry.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
I have a pretty bad memory if you can't tell by now, so...

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
I literally forgot what I was going to say mid-sentence.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
Oh no, it's so over.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Oh no, I'm sorry.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I'm over the place today.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I'm like...

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
That's what I feel like right now.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
That's what I feel like.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
That's my problem.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
I feel like really hyper for some reason

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
and happy and excited

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
and my energy is like...

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah, I'm just like...

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
all over the place right now.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
I'm really sorry for that.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Maybe that means I should stop yapping

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
and just start gaming.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
Maybe that's a song that should shut up.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
I feel the same whenever you stream.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Oh, that's super sweet, I'm glad.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
I'm really glad to hear that.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
You're gonna be on drugs?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I'm not on drugs! What the fuck?

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
No, I'm sober!

15:41.000 --> 15:47.000
Unless you would describe

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
my OG sense as my drug, then yeah.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
My misters are definitely my drug, I will say.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
I'm addicted.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
If you couldn't help by now.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
I'm so sorry for being so needy today.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
I don't know what happened over me.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
I actually wanted to ask you something.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
I'm sorry if I'm overwhelming you in any way.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
I'm sorry.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
Initially, when I just had my debut and stuff,

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
I didn't plan for this to happen.

16:27.000 --> 16:33.000
I didn't plan to feel so close with you this fast.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
To be honest, I didn't even know

16:36.000 --> 16:42.000
if I'm going to want to get tributes.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I wasn't even sure about that.

16:44.000 --> 16:52.000
To be honest, I didn't know what to expect.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I didn't know what to expect.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
I didn't know what's going to happen

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
or how people are going to be with me.

17:01.000 --> 17:07.000
When I started streaming,

17:07.000 --> 17:13.000
every stream, each and every one of you

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
has been so sweet to me.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Every single time.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Every single time.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
So kind.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
Really amazing to me.

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
The more days went by,

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
the more I felt closer and closer to you.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
All of these emotions started rising up.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Here we are, I guess.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
It kind of snowballed into it.

17:49.000 --> 17:55.000
I'm sorry if it overwhelms you in any way.

17:55.000 --> 18:03.000
I didn't think that it would get like this.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
I wasn't expecting to feel this close

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
and this happy with all of you here.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
It just snowballed into it.

18:21.000 --> 18:27.000
I'm sorry if it's overwhelming you in any way

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
or if you feel like maybe I'm being too much

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
or anything like that.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
For that, I apologize.

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
It just kind of happened.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
You're just that amazing, I guess,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
is what I'm trying to say.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
It's hard for me to award it.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
You've all been just so sweet to me.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
So kind to me, so nice to me.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
How can I not feel like this?

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
How can I not feel like this?

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
You've been nothing but kind to me

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
and sweet to me

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
and reassuring me whenever I'm nervous.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I just genuinely feel so lucky to have you.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
I genuinely just feel so lucky.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
You're all so amazing, really.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I really mean it.

19:28.000 --> 19:38.000
That's why I'm feeling as close as I am with you

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
and I am the way that I am, I guess.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
It's all thanks to you.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
It's all because you're amazing.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
And I genuinely mean it.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
Like I said before, I did not think

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
that I would do any of the stuff

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
that I have done the past few days.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
That was not in my plan.

20:04.000 --> 20:10.000
I was just going to restrain myself

20:10.000 --> 20:16.000
and have very strong boundaries

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
or limits and restrain myself

20:18.000 --> 20:25.000
and just stick to being the big Brad 24-7

20:26.000 --> 20:34.000
You just melted my heart.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I do love being a Brad sometimes

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
to rile you up or tease you

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
and stuff like that.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
But for the most part,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
it's hard to be like,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I don't know, you're just so nice to you.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
How can I not be nice to you?

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
So I couldn't stay like a Brad 24-7

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
when you've all just been showing me

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
so much kindness and sweetness.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
So, yeah.

21:08.000 --> 21:14.000
Sorry about this big yapping session.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
I just wanted to get it out of my chest.

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
I guess maybe it would make more sense.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Maybe it won't,

21:29.000 --> 21:37.000
but I guess I still wanted to tell you, I guess.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
Okay, I should probably start the game.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
Let me go to my other screen.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
Oh, fuck.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
I need to move, I need to move.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Love's so strong, it broke the law.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
Okay, literally, though.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Literally, though!

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
And I feel embarrassed about it.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Because I was going to stick to the Brad part

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
for at least a few weeks, you know?

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
But my god, you're so sweet to me

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
that all it took is one or two streams

22:43.000 --> 22:49.000
and I'm head over heels in love with you.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Fuck!

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I hate you!

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Stupid fucking energy, son.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
I hate you.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
God damn it.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
Okay.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
Let me open the game.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Ow!

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
Fucking arm.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
Where's my steam things out?

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Ah!

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
Stupid fucking mouse, holy shit.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
Okay.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
Sorry, I'm really all over the place today.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
My apologies.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Fuck.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
I'm so fucking cringe today.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
Oh my god, I'm going to get a mess.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
Help.

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
Okay, let's start the game.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Fuck.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Fuck.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
That sounds loud to me.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Is it loud for you two?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Fuck.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Fuck.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Fuck.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000

Fuck.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Fuck.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
It's loud for you two, hold on.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Fuck, I forgot.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
I'm going to have to fucking reopen it.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
It's cause the game breaks.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Oh, maybe it doesn't.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
But is it too loud for you or is it just me?

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
Is this the loud?

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Can you see it?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000

Because I'm smart

50:53.960 --> 50:55.960
Smart baby

51:03.960 --> 51:05.960
You didn't call I see at work

51:05.960 --> 51:07.960
So she went to your office

Are you sick?

51:23.960 --> 51:25.960

51:33.960 --> 51:35.960
I don't know when I drink water it happens

51:35.960 --> 51:37.960
I'm probably fucking dying

51:37.960 --> 51:39.960
I'm sorry

51:39.960 --> 51:41.960
It's been fun

51:41.960 --> 51:43.960
It's been fun Ojisan

51:43.960 --> 51:45.960
But it's time for me to

51:45.960 --> 51:47.960
Fucking die

51:53.960 --> 51:55.960
Don't tell me what to do

51:57.960 --> 51:59.960
Why are you not the one jumping

51:59.960 --> 52:01.960
Are you, shut up

52:05.960 --> 52:07.960
Because we'll die with I see

52:09.960 --> 52:11.960
I don't know

52:11.960 --> 52:13.960
I don't know if Ojisans are this committed

52:13.960 --> 52:15.960
Commit

52:15.960 --> 52:17.960
Committed that they would die with me

52:19.960 --> 52:21.960
No, they literally fucking die

52:23.960 --> 52:25.960
Literally as I say that

52:25.960 --> 52:27.960
Literally as I say that I fucking die

52:27.960 --> 52:29.960
What the fuck

Emi is correct

52:31.960 --> 52:33.960
Oh wow, really

52:33.960 --> 52:35.960
I didn't know

52:35.960 --> 52:37.960
Ojisan is that dedicated

52:57.960 --> 52:59.960
Thank you for all the love you

53:03.960 --> 53:05.960
Why am I like this

53:05.960 --> 53:07.960
Like this is really easy

53:07.960 --> 53:09.960
Like this is really fucking easy

53:09.960 --> 53:11.960
Why am I playing so badly

53:11.960 --> 53:13.960
You know what, it's your fault

53:13.960 --> 53:15.960
You know what Ojisan, this is your fault

53:15.960 --> 53:17.960
I'm playing so bad

53:17.960 --> 53:19.960
It's because you keep distracting me

53:19.960 --> 53:21.960
I'm actually a really good gamer

53:21.960 --> 53:23.960
But you're just distracting me right now

53:23.960 --> 53:25.960
That's on you

53:27.960 --> 53:29.960
Stop distracting me

53:29.960 --> 53:31.960
You're making me look bad

53:33.960 --> 53:35.960
Don't

53:39.960 --> 53:41.960
Now we can do that

53:47.960 --> 53:49.960
Come on, come on

53:49.960 --> 53:51.960

Yeah, yeah, yeah

54:07.960 --> 54:09.960
Okay, I guess

54:09.960 --> 54:11.960
I am going now

54:23.960 --> 54:25.960
Why do I go now

54:25.960 --> 54:27.960
I assume here, right?

54:29.960 --> 54:31.960
Okay, okay

54:31.960 --> 54:33.960
I'm doing good

54:41.960 --> 54:43.960
Why am I supposed to go then

54:47.960 --> 54:49.960
I thought that's where I'm supposed to go

54:53.960 --> 54:55.960
I was so sure that's where I'm supposed to

54:55.960 --> 54:57.960
Fucking go, what the fuck

54:57.960 --> 54:59.960
It's so fucking over

55:05.960 --> 55:07.960
I think you're supposed to jump

55:07.960 --> 55:09.960
Back to the rope thingy

55:09.960 --> 55:11.960
I'll try that

55:11.960 --> 55:13.960
I'll try that

55:17.960 --> 55:19.960
Okay, okay

55:21.960 --> 55:23.960
Okay, let's do this again

55:27.960 --> 55:29.960
Okay, I go here

55:31.960 --> 55:33.960
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait

55:33.960 --> 55:35.960
I don't trust this

55:39.960 --> 55:41.960
Now

55:47.960 --> 55:49.960
Now I go here

55:49.960 --> 55:51.960
Okay, okay, okay

55:51.960 --> 55:53.960
I love listening to icy rage

55:53.960 --> 55:55.960
I'm so sorry for your ear-seeing me

55:57.960 --> 55:59.960
Okay, okay

55:59.960 --> 56:01.960
Now we're doing it

56:01.960 --> 56:03.960
Look at me now

56:05.960 --> 56:07.960
Oh fuck

56:07.960 --> 56:09.960
Oh shit, I almost fell again

56:09.960 --> 56:11.960
I almost

56:13.960 --> 56:15.960
That scared the shit out of me

56:15.960 --> 56:17.960
That fucking jump scared me

56:21.960 --> 56:23.960
I don't know why that jump scared me so much

56:23.960 --> 56:25.960
I really don't know

56:27.960 --> 56:29.960
Fuck

56:35.960 --> 56:37.960
Oh fuck, oh fuck

56:37.960 --> 56:39.960
Think fast

56:39.960 --> 56:41.960
Think fast

56:41.960 --> 56:43.960
Think fast

56:43.960 --> 56:45.960
Come on

56:45.960 --> 56:47.960
Come on, think fast

56:49.960 --> 56:51.960
Oh god

56:51.960 --> 56:53.960
Okay

56:53.960 --> 56:55.960
Okay

56:55.960 --> 56:57.960
We did this

56:59.960 --> 57:01.960
We're alive and well

57:01.960 --> 57:03.960
I like the music

57:05.960 --> 57:07.960
Oh fuck

57:07.960 --> 57:09.960
I thought I could walk around and relax

57:09.960 --> 57:11.960
And then these guys show up

57:11.960 --> 57:13.960
Please, I just want to take a sit

57:13.960 --> 57:15.960
And fucking relax

57:15.960 --> 57:17.960
Fuck off

57:17.960 --> 57:19.960
Let me enjoy the music

57:25.960 --> 57:27.960
Blablabla

57:31.960 --> 57:33.960
Oh god

57:33.960 --> 57:35.960
Stop ruining the music for me

57:35.960 --> 57:37.960
Stop yelling

57:39.960 --> 57:41.960
Fuck off

57:41.960 --> 57:43.960
I'm trying to enjoy the art

57:43.960 --> 57:45.960
In this place

57:45.960 --> 57:47.960
And you're really really

57:47.960 --> 57:49.960
Really distracting

57:51.960 --> 57:53.960
Can you open this

57:53.960 --> 57:55.960
What's in here

57:59.960 --> 58:01.960
No

58:01.960 --> 58:03.960
I don't see it

58:03.960 --> 58:05.960
I'm stupid

58:05.960 --> 58:07.960
Can I click this

58:07.960 --> 58:09.960
I can

58:09.960 --> 58:11.960
Okay

58:11.960 --> 58:13.960
Thanks

58:17.960 --> 58:19.960
Okay

58:19.960 --> 58:21.960
It's a big ball

58:21.960 --> 58:23.960
We're balling

58:23.960 --> 58:25.960
I love ball

58:25.960 --> 58:27.960
Why can't I use it

58:27.960 --> 58:29.960
It looks like I could move it

58:29.960 --> 58:31.960
Oh

58:31.960 --> 58:33.960
Okay

58:33.960 --> 58:35.960
Nice

58:35.960 --> 58:37.960
I'm protected by the ball

58:47.960 --> 58:49.960
I'm balling

58:51.960 --> 58:53.960
I'm balling

58:57.960 --> 58:59.960
More balls in this game

58:59.960 --> 59:01.960
Yeah, there's so many balls in this game

59:01.960 --> 59:03.960
I think that's fair

59:13.960 --> 59:15.960
Ball is life

59:15.960 --> 59:17.960
I agree with you Amy

59:17.960 --> 59:19.960
I've never heard

59:19.960 --> 59:21.960
I have more true statement in my life

59:27.960 --> 59:29.960
Stop

59:29.960 --> 59:31.960
Fuck you

59:33.960 --> 59:35.960
Fuck off

59:39.960 --> 59:41.960
I'm in the gun

59:43.960 --> 59:45.960
Okay, I guess I have to take the shotgun

59:45.960 --> 59:47.960
Let me see shotguns

59:49.960 --> 59:51.960
I'm going to use the med kit

59:51.960 --> 59:53.960
I don't want to die

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.960
Okay, okay, let's go

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.960
And then

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.960
Look what happens

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.960
Okay

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.960
Now

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.960
Nice

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.960
Look at me go

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.960
I'm so

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.960
Fucking stop

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.960
Fucking asshole

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.960
Let me jump

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.960
Come on

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.960
Ow

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.960
Please

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.960
At least I can one shot them with the shotgun

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.960
That's pretty nice

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.960
I like that

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.960
I think

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.960
I feel like you could have done that

01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.960
Much easier with just a bullet

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.960
But that was good, okay true

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.960
You're not wrong

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.960
You are not wrong

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.960
I didn't even think of that

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.960
But I think that's what the game wants you to do

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.960
I

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.960
I swear every time

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.960
Look at me

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.960
Go

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.960
Bang bang bang, okay literally though

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.960
I notice that too every time I'm like

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.960
Proud of myself or something that I do in the game

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.960
And I'm like look at me

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.960
I get like fucking shot at

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.960
I think it's a sign

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.960
It's a sign guys

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.960
It's a sign that I should not be proud of

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.960
Anything that I do

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.960
Okay and

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.960
Okay and

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.960
Okay and

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.960
Give me everything you've got bitch

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.960
In this case

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.960
One of your crusaders

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.960
Some have even said

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.960
Warmonger was one of your king Arthur's knights

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.960
I do not know

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.960
How the fool came by it

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.960
For it is clearly far older

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.960
Than the 11th century

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.960
Oh god is this a boss fight

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.960
Oh god this is gonna be so fucking bad

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.960

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.960
Looking forward to it

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.960
Oh god

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.960
Oh fuck

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.960

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.960
It's so over

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.960
It's so fucking over for me

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.960
Oh fuck

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.960
Oh

This is gonna take a fucking

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.960
Please leave me alone

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.960

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.960
Oh god

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.960
I was so scared

I have to do this fight for like

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.960
10 fucking hours

Look at you being a gamer

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.960
I know right

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.960
I am so scared

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:19.960
Why am I acting like I am fucking Santa or something

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.960
I guess

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.960
Continue

It's so pretty here

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.960
It's like I can almost

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.960
I can almost breathe the fresh air from here

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.960
Wow look how beautiful

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.960
Wow

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.960

I can get into the postcard business

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.960
Yeah I don't think I am doing postcards

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.960
But that's not the business

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:53.960
You will see

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.960
Oh it smells stinky bruh

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.960

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:13.960
No

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.960
I wanted to do a beautiful swan dive

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.960
From our G songs

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.960

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.960
But I wanted to show off

01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.960
Something amazing

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.960
I wanted you to go

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.960
Wow

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.960
But now you are like

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.960
Man this bitch can even swan dive

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.960
Shit sucks

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.960
Can't even impress my G songs

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.960
Because I can't swan dive

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.960
Gotta be high up

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.960
How high up do I need to be

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.960
To do the swan dive

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.960
How high do I need to be

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.960
Let me try again

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.960
Sorry I just really wanna do it

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.960
I think swan dive looks cool

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.960
Space jump

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.960
Swing

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.960
I don't wanna do it

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.960
I think swan dive looks cool

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.960
Space jump

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.960
No

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.960
Let me swan dive

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.960
I wanna be a beautiful swan

01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.960
For G song

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.960
No

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.960
Come on

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.960
You already

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.960
Dive straight into our hearts

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.960
I see

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.960
Aww

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.960
That's really sweet

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.960
My last try

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.960
My last try

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.960
My last try

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:35.960
I did it

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.960
Yay

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.960
Look at G song

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.960
I learned how to swan dive for you

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.960
Are you proud of me

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.960
Yay

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.960
I can swan dive

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.960
And look extra cool for you

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.960
Look at me

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.960
Wow

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.960
I'm so happy

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.960
No

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.960
Why did I fall

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.960
Great job

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.960
Thank you

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.960
I like to make my data proud

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.960
I wanna be the best baby that I can be

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.960

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.960

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:35.960
What is the goal here

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.960
I'm trying to go

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.960
I'm trying to go down

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.960
What am I doing

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.960
I didn't know what I'm doing

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.960
Sorry

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.960
I'm dumb

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.960
This

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.960
Yeah, that is best

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.960
Yay

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.960
I'm glad you're here

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:03.960
That makes me happy

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.960
I tried to

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.960
Look so pretty

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.960
I really like this level

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.960
It looks really pretty

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:15.960
Oh no, not this guy again

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.960
Please fuck off

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.960
It's bitch

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.960
Oh no, not this guy again

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.960
Please fuck off

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.960
It's bitch

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.960
Oh no

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.960
No

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.960
No

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:35.960
No

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.960
Don't say that

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.960
Don't say that

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.960
Don't say that

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.960
Don't say that

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.960
Don't say that

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.960
Don't

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.960
Don't say that

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.960
I'm not dumb, you're just a baby

01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.960
Yeah, I'm a dumb baby

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.960
Oops

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.960
Ah, okay

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:09.960
I'll do this

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.960
I mean, some of my OGsans

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.960
would be considered pretty ancient artifacts

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.960
So, OGsans

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.960
You're my artifact

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.960
You're my

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.960
Lovely artifact

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:35.960
That's why I love you so much

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:41.960
I'm sorry

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.960
I'm sorry

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.960
I love you

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.960
I didn't mean that

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.960
I didn't mean that

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.960
I love you, GSan

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.960
I love you

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.960
I was just joking

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.960
I love you

01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.960
I love you

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:01.960
I was just joking

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.960
I didn't mean that

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.960
How do I

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.960
How do I crouch?

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.960
Oh fuck

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.960
How do I

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.960
I don't remember how to crouch

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.960
Will you take care of your ancient artifact?

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.960
Of course

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.960
Of course I would

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.960
You gotta take good care of artifacts

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:37.960
To keep them all good and nice

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:39.960
You know

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.960
I forgot how to crouch

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:45.960
I wanna check

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:47.960
Shall we?

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.960
I have a pretty bad memory

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.960
F

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.960
Okay

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.960
F

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:07.960
Nice

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.960
How do I

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.960
How do I open this

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.960
I'm probably gonna have to do something

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.960
Aren't I?

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:21.960
I need to be really fast

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.960
Okay

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.960
I'm definitely not

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.960
Okay

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.960
Okay I did it

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.960
Fuck

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.960
Ow

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.960
Ow

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:45.960
Oh god, I almost got exploded

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.960
Stop it

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.960
Okay, where's the rest of them?

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.960
Somewhere

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.960
Will you polish your artifacts

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.960
Often I see?

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.960
Of course

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.960
Of course I will

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.960
Can I keep you all nice and happy?

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.960
I'll make sure my artifact stays nice

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.960
Can I go here?

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:23.960
Andy is trying to shoot you

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.960
Okay, real

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.960
How the fuck do I get up there

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.960
Fuck, I'm stupid

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.960
I don't know how to fucking get up there

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.960
Oh, it's so over

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:43.960
It's so over

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.960
Oh, maybe like this

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:51.960
Yeah, okay

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.960
That works

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:55.960
Yeah, die, die

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.960
Nice

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.960
Shiny

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.960
Oh

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:25.960
Ow

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:27.960
I'm almost gonna fucking die again

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.960
Oh no, no, no, no

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.960
Fuck off

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.960
Fuck off

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.960
Okay, give me the gun

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.960
Give me the gun, I want new guns

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.960
Where's the other gun?

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.960
Give me, give me, give me, give me

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:51.960
Will my value increase with my age?

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.960
Well, some men

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.960
Age like fine wine

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.960
So

01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.960
Your value could increase

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.960
As you age

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.960
If we're thinking that way

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.960
Right?

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:11.960
Why is this too far?

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.960
I guess I go from here

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.960
Okay

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.960
That's so men age like milk

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.960
No, not my

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.960
Not my mistress

01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.960
All my mistress

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.960
Age like fine wine

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.960
The love you have for me

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.960
The love you have for me

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.960
Is what is gonna

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.960
Make you age like fine wine

01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.960
So you're welcome

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:01.960
I need a gun in the spot

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:03.960
I need a gun in the spot

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.960
Okay, I'm fucking stupid

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:29.960
Wait, maybe I'm not

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.960
Maybe this is the right way

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:33.960
Wait, maybe I'm not stupid

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.960
I'm spinning for like 10 fucking years

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:41.960
It's all thanks to the icing aid

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.960
Yeah, that's true

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.960
That helps as well

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.960
So make sure to drink lots of

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.960
To stay nice and

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.960
Fresh

01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:57.960
Fuck!

01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:59.960
Go on!

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.960
Jesus Christ

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.960
icing aid is our life

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.960
Elixir

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.960
Yes, I am

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.960
That's true

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.960
Okay

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.960
I'll have to get these traps

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.960
Moving to pass through

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.960
Only you think of it that way

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:29.960
I don't like it

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.960
I don't care, shut up

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.960
Oh

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.960
I need to adjust myself

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:47.960
Any adjusters?

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:49.960
No

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.960
No, no

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.960
No, I don't want to do this again

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.960
No, no, that was so bad

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.960
That was so bad

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.960
No, no, I have to do it again

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:03.960
No, I was doing so good

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.960
Fuck, now I have to do shit again

01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.960
Oh my fucking god

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.960
I was doing so good

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:17.960
I was like on a roll

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.960
Just doing all the jumps perfectly

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.960
And then I fuck up

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.960
Okay

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.960
Okay, gotta focus

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.960
Gotta focus

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.960
You can't distract me a decent

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.960
I have to focus

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.960
This is very important, okay

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.960
Gonna have to wait

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.960
Okay, I'm fucking terrified

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.960
But do I assume that I need to

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.960
Use the rope anyways

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.960
Right

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.960
Cause I need to go this way, I think

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.960
Adjust

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.960
When people ask us

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.960
When people ask us

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.960
What the secret of our youth is

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.960
We're gonna have a hard time answering this

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.960
So we'll just need to work questions

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.960
Okay, that's very true

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.960
That is very true

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.960
No, no, no, please

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:31.960
Please, no

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.960
I almost fucking fell again, please

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.960
One

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:41.960
Okay

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.960
I got a checkpoint

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:45.960
Yay

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.960
I got a checkpoint

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.960
All is good

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:51.960
I won't have to do that

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.960
Jump all over again

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.960
Nice

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.960
Okay, I guess that's the way to go

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.960
Up, up, up, up, up

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.960
Upies

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.960
Upies, upies

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.960
Up, up, up, up, up

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:15.960
Upies

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:25.960
Upies for a little icy

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.960
Yay

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.960
I would love that

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.960
That would be so cute

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.960
Uh

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.960
Let me see

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.960
Oh god, he's right there

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:43.960
Fuck

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.960
No, no, no, no

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.960
No hunting

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:51.960
No hunting, I'm the hunter

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.960
I'm the hunter here

01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.960
Oh god

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:01.960
I'm gonna have to think

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.960
I don't like thinking

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:05.960
I don't like thinking

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:07.960
I want Mr. to do all the thinking

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.960
for me

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.960
Can I do that for me, please?

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.960
Oh, shiny

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.960
Nice

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:21.960
Wait

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:31.960
Okay, let's see

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.960
Let's see where this

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.960
takes us

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:37.960
Oh, nice

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:39.960
Okay

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:41.960
Look at me go

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.960
Let me connect

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.960
my one brain cell for you, IC

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.960
Thank you

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.960
If itch.org

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.960
connects one of his brain cells

01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:59.960
I'll have so many

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:01.960
So thank you

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.960
I appreciate

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.960
Is there anything like

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.960
in here?

01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:21.960
No

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.960
I

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.960
Assume

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.960
Okay, well I guess

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.960
what I assumed was fucking wrong

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:35.960
I thought I can like

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:37.960
jump

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.960
But I guess I thought wrong

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.960
What the fuck though?

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:49.960
Where am I supposed to go?

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.960
Like it really looks to me

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.960
like that's where you're supposed to go

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.960
Oh wait

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.960
Maybe I can jump here

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.960
Oh wait

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:13.960
How do I jump down?

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.960
Please

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:23.960
Wow

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.960
Good stream

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:31.960
Oh

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.960
Look I found a shiny

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.960
Okay

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.960
That was a good

01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.960
That was like a good reason to fall

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.960
Nice

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:45.960
Oh

01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.960
Ooh there's a thing

01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:55.960
I can like

01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:57.960
Who's here?

01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.960
Fuck

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.960
Is there anything

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.960
I wonder if there's anything

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.960
in here

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.960
Can I do anything?

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.960
Over here

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.960
I

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.960
Hmm

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:23.960
Ooh

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.960
Okay

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:27.960
Okay

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.960
Can I just like

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:39.960
try to

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.960
Fuck

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.960
Oh no

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.960
It's getting difficult

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.960
It's getting too difficult

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.960
for my small brain

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.960
It's getting too difficult

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.960
for my small brain

01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.960
Where the fuck am I supposed to go now?

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.960
I don't know where to go now

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:05.960
Oh no

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:07.960
It's so over

01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.960
I don't know where to go

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.960
No

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.960
Please come on

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:25.960
Just just jump back

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.960
Just jump back

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.960
Look for other pillars

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:35.960
where the mats will cover

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:37.960
But I don't see any

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:39.960
I don't see any

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:41.960
I'm stupid

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.960
I'm stupid

01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:57.960
I don't know where to go

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:01.960
I ruined it

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.960
I don't know where to go

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.960
I don't know

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.960
where to go

01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.960
Jesus

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:11.960
I'm gonna be stuck here forever

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.960
and die

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:15.960
I'm just gonna die in this fucking tomb

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.960
I need help

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:21.960
Jesus

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.960
Hmm

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:39.960
Okay

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.960
Okay well I got here please

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.960
I was here already before I think

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.960
Quick center rescue operation

01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:55.960
Yeah I really need that

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.960
You're right back I see I believe you'll clear this

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.960
By the time I'm back you can do it

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.960
I don't know about that

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.960
But I'm glad you believe in me this much

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:15.960
Thank you

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:17.960
Oh fuck I fucked it up

01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:23.960
Well

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:25.960
Yeah

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.960
Damn I'm doing so bad today

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.960
Where's my Jesus

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.960
Rescue team

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.960

01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:51.960
But I don't

01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:55.960
But I don't

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.960
It's fucking camera angle

01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.960
Stop

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:01.960
Do I need to wait for it to go all the way back up

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:03.960
Yep I think so

01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:05.960
Man I hate this

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.960
Okay can I jump now please

Nice

01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:57.960
Bitch what are you doing

Okay okay now we're

01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:13.960
Back up here

01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:19.960
This is where I fell from

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.960
This is where I fell from

01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:25.960
Please

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:29.960
Control doesn't make me jump

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:31.960
Down

01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:33.960
I did not mean to click that

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.960
Please

01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:37.960
Okay f is what I need

That doesn't make sense though

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:47.960
Did I go like this

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:51.960
Like this

01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:55.960
I guess

01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:57.960
Down here

01:31:57.960 --> 01:31:59.960
Right here

01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:01.960
And then

01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:03.960

01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:07.960
I'm over here

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:15.960
Okay we're actually making progress

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:17.960

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:55.960
I don't think I am

01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:57.960
You should be very careful of me right now

01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:01.960
You should be very careful

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:03.960
With your words right now G-san

01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:05.960
I'm

01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:07.960
I'm in the very big rage right now

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:09.960
I will use my claws

01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:13.960
Fuck

01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:19.960
Okay

01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:23.960
I don't think this is the right way

01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:27.960
Go here

01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:29.960
I want to see Dark Souls

01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:31.960
No fuck that

01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:33.960
No

01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:35.960
I'm good

01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:37.960
How do you want me to play Dark Souls

01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:39.960
When you see how bad I am

01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:41.960
At this game

01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:43.960
How are you gonna tell me

01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:45.960
How are you gonna tell me to play Dark Souls

01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:49.960
When you see how fucking bad I am

01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:51.960
At this fucking game

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:53.960
That's just going to be like

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:55.960
A whole another level of rage

01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:57.960
I'm gonna like jump out the window

01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:59.960
From how much rage I'm gonna feel

01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:05.960
And Elden Ring DDLC

01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:07.960
No cause I'm still gonna rage

01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:09.960
I'm gonna suck at that

01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:11.960
I'm gonna suck at that game

01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:13.960
I'm gonna fucking die the whole stream

01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:17.960
Why would you want to see that

01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:21.960
That's the content

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:23.960
I mean

01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:25.960
You're getting it right now with this game

01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:29.960
I don't think it's very fun to watch

01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:31.960
When it keeps like repeating

01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:33.960
For like a hundred fucking times

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:37.960
Come on

01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:39.960
Come on bitch please

01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:43.960
I'm okay

01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:45.960
Okay fuck this

01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:47.960
I'm not gonna do anything with it right now

01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:49.960
I'm just gonna do this

01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:51.960
I would be very proud if you beat Dark Souls

01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:55.960
Well I guess I'm a disappointment

01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:57.960
Because it's gonna happen

01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.960
Oh my fucking god

01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:09.960
Please

01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:13.960
I'm already dying here

01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:15.960
Here

01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:19.960
Please

01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:37.960
Sorry I wanted to make it look nice

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:41.960
I am not going here right

01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:43.960
Like

01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:45.960
Or am I

01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:47.960
Am I supposed to go here or not

01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:49.960
I'm not sure and I'm too fucking terrified

01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:51.960
I see can you save right now

01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:53.960
Let me see

01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:59.960
Not the shooting

01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:03.960
Yeah okay that's good

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:05.960
I can save here then

01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:09.960
I guess let's try and see where this takes us

01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:13.960
I

01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:17.960
Is this where I was already

01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:23.960
I'm fucking loading

01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:25.960
I'm fucking loading

01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:27.960
I'm not doing this shit again

01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:31.960
I'm dealing with that fucking thing again

01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:33.960
For like the billions time

01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:35.960
I'm sorry

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:39.960
Okay

01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:43.960
At least now we know that this is not

01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:45.960
Where I'm supposed to go

01:47:57.960 --> 01:47:59.960
Okay I guess I'm supposed to go here then

01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:09.960
Then go here I guess

01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:13.960
I

01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:19.960
But I need something here

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:25.960
Fuck

01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:27.960
I need something here

01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:31.960
Where am I gonna get it from

01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:39.960
Wait we can save and load anywhere

01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:41.960
I guess so

01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:43.960
I guess we can

01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:45.960
I guess so

01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:47.960
I'm sorry I see but this is big content

01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:49.960
Plus adorable

01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:51.960
You know it's really pain

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.960
When I'm sitting here and I'm like

01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:57.960
Going insane from raging

01:48:57.960 --> 01:48:59.960
And you go and tell me

01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:01.960
That this is big content

01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:03.960
Out of all content I make

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:05.960
This is the big content

01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:07.960
Big content

01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:09.960
I am fucking dying

01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:17.960
God I wish I could move it

01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:21.960
Fuck

01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:23.960
How the fuck am I supposed to

01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:25.960
Like get here a thing

01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:27.960
Where am I supposed to get that shit from

01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:29.960
I should

01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.960
Oh wait

01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:37.960
I need to do it fast

01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:39.960
Oh

01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:41.960
Okay

01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:43.960
Never mind I just need it to be quick

01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:45.960
About it okay

01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:47.960
Fuck this stupid

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:49.960
Real AGsons

01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.960
No DGIC is big content

01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:55.960
You know I agree

01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:57.960
I agree with you

01:49:57.960 --> 01:49:59.960
I think so too

01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:03.960
I have so much fun

01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:05.960
In the DJ streams

01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:07.960
But

01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:09.960
With that being said I did have a lot of fun

01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:11.960
In yesterday's ASMR stream

01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.960
As well so

01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:15.960
So I will say that

01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:17.960
But that's because you make it very fun for me

01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:21.960
Where do I go now

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:23.960
I didn't see what it actually fucking did

01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:25.960
Dude distracting reading

01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:27.960
What you're saying to me

01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:29.960
I don't even know what it fucking did

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.960
Help

01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:37.960
What did moving this thing do

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:39.960
Did anyone see

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.960
Cause I didn't see

01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:43.960
I was too busy reading what you're saying

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:45.960
ASMR baby

01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:47.960
I see is my favorite

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:49.960
I'm not surprised

01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:53.960
Well I would say

01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:55.960
Okay you know what you're right

01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:57.960
You are very right

01:50:57.960 --> 01:50:59.960
I don't know why I didn't think of that

01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.960
I should say that's very fucking true

01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:05.960
Very good at the points

01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:09.960
I think it added a lot of fun

01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:11.960
It's

01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:13.960
I think it added

01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:15.960
Water somewhere

01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:19.960
Okay should I jump

01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:25.960
I guess it added water here

01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:27.960
I don't think this had water before

01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:29.960
Right

01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:37.960
Yeah this definitely did not have water

01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:39.960
Was this supposed to be here

01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:43.960
Or is the current too strong

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:45.960
I can't tell

01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:51.960
Okay is there anything here

01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:53.960
Am I doing here anything

01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:57.960
Nope nothing here

01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:09.960
I

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:15.960
The middle behind you

01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:17.960
Oh no

01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:19.960
What's behind me

01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:23.960
Is it you

01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:25.960
Are you behind me

01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:29.960
Fuck

01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:39.960
Fuck

01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:45.960
Is there anything in here

01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:47.960
That I can do

01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:51.960
Wait can I go

01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:53.960
Wait can I go

01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:55.960
I'm here hold on

01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:57.960
Or is it just like the same fucking thing

01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:03.960
That's literally the same place

01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:05.960
That I was at I think

01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:07.960
This does anything

01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:13.960
The pillar is

01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:15.960
Yeah I see the glowing pillar

01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:17.960
But like I don't know what

01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:19.960
The fucking like deal with it

01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:21.960
Cause I'm really fucking stupid

01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:37.960
Can you use the grapple on it

01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:39.960
I can only use the grapple

01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:41.960
On like the thing

01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:43.960
That you can stand on

01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:47.960
I can only grapple

01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:49.960
On this thing to like move myself with

01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:51.960
The thing

01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:55.960
Man I hate this level

01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:01.960
This fucking level so much

01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:07.960
Uh

01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:09.960
Okay

01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:17.960

What do I fucking do here

01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:21.960
Go straight

01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:23.960
Like straight from here

01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:27.960
Do you want me to go like in here

01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:29.960
Is that what you mean

01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:31.960
Or do you want me to go somewhere else

01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:37.960
I know what I mean

01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:41.960
Why do you say go straight

01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:43.960
Do you mean like here

01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:45.960
Like straight from here

01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:47.960
I feel so fucking stupid

01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:49.960
I want to like bury myself

01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:51.960
From embarrassed man

01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:59.960
There is a small cave behind you

01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:01.960
Here

01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:05.960
Wait what cave

01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:07.960
I'm blind

01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:09.960
Where is the cave

01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:11.960
I don't see a cave

01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:15.960
Are you talking about this thing

01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:17.960
Or something else

01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:19.960
I'm sorry

01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:21.960
I'm really stupid

01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:23.960
And I'm bad with directions

01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:25.960
And I'm bad with thinking

01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:31.960
Why do I

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:35.960
Why do I

01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:43.960
Someone told me there is a cave

01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:45.960
But I don't see any cave

01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:49.960
Being all of this thing

01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:51.960
Is just so cute

01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:53.960
Does it

It looks like a turtle

02:07:35.960 --> 02:07:37.960
It was a mouse

02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:39.960
That turtle

02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:17.960
Can't say the same

02:32:17.960 --> 02:32:19.960
She wants out

02:32:19.960 --> 02:32:21.960
I do want to finish the game

02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:23.960
But this level was like

02:32:23.960 --> 02:32:25.960
Something else

02:32:25.960 --> 02:32:27.960
Just fucking insanity

02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:29.960
What she was ridiculous

02:32:29.960 --> 02:32:31.960
You did good I see

02:32:31.960 --> 02:32:33.960
I don't know about that but thank you

02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:35.960
I couldn't have done it without your help

02:32:35.960 --> 02:32:37.960
I couldn't have done it without your help

02:32:37.960 --> 02:32:39.960
You helped me so much

02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:47.960
Amazing today thank you

02:32:47.960 --> 02:32:49.960
Maybe next time it will be easy

02:32:51.960 --> 02:32:53.960
God I fucking hope so

02:32:53.960 --> 02:32:55.960
I hope it will be easier than

02:32:55.960 --> 02:32:57.960
Than this one

02:32:57.960 --> 02:32:59.960
You were not ready for this

02:32:59.960 --> 02:33:01.960
I literally wasn't

02:33:01.960 --> 02:33:03.960
I really wasn't ready for this

02:33:03.960 --> 02:33:05.960
But

02:33:05.960 --> 02:33:07.960
It will make for a really fucking funny

02:33:07.960 --> 02:33:09.960
Sounds in my DJ stream

02:33:09.960 --> 02:33:11.960
So I am definitely gonna

02:33:11.960 --> 02:33:13.960
Make sure to write a note

02:33:13.960 --> 02:33:15.960
So that I don't forget to do that

02:33:15.960 --> 02:33:17.960
Next DJ stream

02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:19.960
You will hear that shit

02:33:19.960 --> 02:33:21.960
You are gonna hear

02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:23.960
Igor

02:33:23.960 --> 02:33:25.960
And you are gonna hear this motherfucker as well

02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:27.960
You bet you wish you could do that

02:33:29.960 --> 02:33:31.960
You bet you wish you could do that

02:33:33.960 --> 02:33:35.960
It's gonna be so fucking funny

02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:37.960
I can't wait to do another DJ stream

02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:39.960
I am still trying to figure out

02:33:39.960 --> 02:33:41.960
When I should do it

02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:43.960
Cause like this Saturday

02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:45.960
We do like

02:33:45.960 --> 02:33:47.960
The karaoke

02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:49.960
And watch along

02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:51.960
So

02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:53.960
I wonder if maybe the Saturday

02:33:53.960 --> 02:33:55.960
After that

02:33:55.960 --> 02:33:57.960
I should do another DJ stream

02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:03.960
Much to think about

02:34:03.960 --> 02:34:05.960
Why not every weekend

02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:07.960
Because I'd rather not

02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:09.960
Not get drunk every weekend

02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:13.960
And when I DJ

02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:15.960
I need to drink at least a bit

02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:17.960
You know

02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:19.960
To get into the groove of things

02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:25.960
And I mean

02:34:25.960 --> 02:34:27.960
I'll see

02:34:27.960 --> 02:34:29.960
If I see that

02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:31.960
You really really really love my DJ streams

02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:35.960
I might consider doing it

02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:37.960
Every Saturday

02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:39.960
Like every weekend

02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:41.960
I might

02:34:41.960 --> 02:34:43.960
But

02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:45.960
I don't know

02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:47.960
I don't know

02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:49.960
We'll see

02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:51.960
Your stream was awesome

02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:53.960
Yeah, I had a blast

02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:55.960
Honestly

02:34:55.960 --> 02:34:57.960
With that being said

02:34:57.960 --> 02:34:59.960
After all of this chaos

02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:01.960
And rage

02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:03.960
I hope you're ready to relax

02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:05.960
With Strani

02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:07.960
I think she's doing

02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:09.960
SMR right now

02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:11.960
If I'm not wrong

02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:13.960
You are relaxed

02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:15.960
And

02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:17.960
Not think about

02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:19.960
I wish you could do that

02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:21.960
Every two weeks seems good

02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:23.960
Yeah, that's what I was thinking

02:35:23.960 --> 02:35:25.960
I was thinking every other week

02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:27.960
So that would be like

02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:29.960
Twice a month

02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:31.960
I think

02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:33.960
If I'm counting correctly

02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:39.960
Relax after laughing your asses off

02:35:39.960 --> 02:35:41.960
Yeah

02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:43.960
You just spent all your energy laughing

02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:45.960
And now you can just, you know, relax

02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:53.960
Twice a month seems fun

02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:55.960
Yeah, I think twice a month would be pretty good

02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:01.960
I am thankful

02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:05.960
I can't fucking talk

02:36:05.960 --> 02:36:07.960
I am thankful for your help

02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:09.960
Throughout me playing it

02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:11.960
Because I think

02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:13.960
I would have spent much more time

02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:15.960
Playing this fucking level

02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:17.960
If it wasn't for your help

02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:19.960
So I do

02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:21.960
I do appreciate it

02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:23.960
Very much

02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:25.960
What the heck

02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:27.960
Oh jeez that time

02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:29.960
What the heck

02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:31.960
Thank you so much for the donation

02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:33.960
Thank you

02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:35.960
Hold on, let me thank everyone

02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:37.960
Before I go

02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:39.960
Because I keep forgetting

02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:41.960
Data hopes

02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:43.960
You get yourself something nice after all that pain

02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:45.960
Thank you

02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:47.960
That's so nice of you

02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:49.960
I love you, thank you

02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:51.960
Thank you for the $50 donation

02:36:51.960 --> 02:36:53.960
That's really sweet of you

02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:55.960
I appreciate it

02:36:55.960 --> 02:36:57.960
Thank you so much, that's really sweet of you

02:36:57.960 --> 02:36:59.960
You didn't have to do that

02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:01.960
And

02:37:01.960 --> 02:37:03.960
Thank you for the $6 donation

02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:05.960
Sweet and awkward

02:37:05.960 --> 02:37:07.960
Cob is precious

02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:09.960
Thank you

02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:11.960
I'm glad you think so

02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:13.960
I know this is gonna probably sound really weird

02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:17.960
But I did have fun

02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:19.960
I was raging a lot

02:37:19.960 --> 02:37:21.960
And the game pissed me off a lot

02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:23.960
But sharing this experience

02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:25.960
With you is what was fun

02:37:25.960 --> 02:37:27.960
Reading what you say

02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:29.960
And you making me laugh

02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:31.960
And you helping me

02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:33.960
And doing all that stuff

02:37:33.960 --> 02:37:35.960
That was a really fun part

02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:37.960
For me

02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:39.960
So I did have fun

02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:41.960
Even if I was raging

02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:43.960
A lot

02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:49.960
What's tomorrow

02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:53.960
Tomorrow is Thursday

02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:55.960
I think tomorrow, if I'm not wrong

02:37:55.960 --> 02:37:57.960
Is the group collab

02:37:57.960 --> 02:37:59.960
Right

02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:01.960
I think so

02:38:01.960 --> 02:38:03.960
If I'm not wrong

02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:05.960
Tomorrow is supposed to be the power wash group collab

02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:09.960
Let me check

02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:17.960
Yeah, I was right

02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:19.960
I was right

02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:21.960
Tomorrow

02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:23.960
Power wash simulator collab

02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:25.960
With all of my gen mates

02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:27.960
I believe

02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:29.960
We'll all be streaming

02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:31.960
Our POVs

02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:33.960
Like each one of us

02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:35.960
So feel free to open all of our

02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:37.960
POVs if you want to

02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:39.960
And see what we'll do

02:38:39.960 --> 02:38:41.960
But yeah, tomorrow is supposed to be a really fun

02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:43.960
Stream day

02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:45.960
Gonna get to have fun with my cute

02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:47.960
Nice gen mates

02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:49.960
And have fun and be silly

02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:51.960
In power wash

02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:53.960
Again, thank you so much

02:38:53.960 --> 02:38:55.960
For being here

02:38:55.960 --> 02:38:57.960
To me all the time

02:38:57.960 --> 02:38:59.960
And kind to me

02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:01.960
I had a lot of fun with you

02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:03.960
I love you

02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:05.960
And I will see you again

02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:07.960
Tomorrow

02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:09.960
Bye bye for now

02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:11.960
Bye bye

02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:15.960
Bye bye
