00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:57,420
I was gonna talk a bit and stuff, and like, thank the people who donated as well, and I was like, I feel, and I don't know why the fuck, but I accidentally clicked like the exit thing, and my OBS fucking closed, and I was like, fuck, how did that even happen, so yeah, I do, I do apologize, I do apologize,

31
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:24,460
for that, because that was not the plan, I did want to like chat a bit, you know, but yeah, so that happened, yesterday's stream was wild, but like in the best way possible, like, I was so fucking happy, and I was having so much fun, but I did feel like so brain dead like the entire time,

32
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:51,460
like, it felt like a fever dream, it felt like really surreal, it felt like I was on a trip or something, to be honest, like, it was really something, but it was so much fun, like, I couldn't stop laughing, I just enjoyed being my unhinged self, and just being silly, and hanging out with the girls,

33
00:09:51,460 --> 00:10:19,460
and us being all silly, and having fun together, because like, because I missed doing that kind of stuff, because you know, before the debut, you know, we didn't stream, right, so we had a lot more time to like hang out together, or stuff like that, but you know, after the debut, we all have to like focus on establishing ourselves, and

34
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:41,460
and you know, have to stream, and always have like some other stuff that we always like need to do, so it's like, you know, it's more complicated to be in a situation where we can all like catch each other, if that makes sense, I don't know if that makes sense,

35
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:51,460
but yeah, so it was really nice to be able to do that again, I had a blast, it was really good,

36
00:10:51,460 --> 00:11:20,460
it's good, you're seemingly all pretty good friends, yeah, they're all very, very sweet, and nice girls to be around, I feel very lucky to have them as my gen mates, you know, because when I initially joined, you know, there's always that fear of like, oh, you know, I wonder what the people, the other people will be like, when

37
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:49,460
they join, and if, you know, we'll get along, because like, you know, for me, I always wanted to be in like a corpus so that I can make friends with the girls in it, and so that we can grow closer and closer together, because we're all in this together, and we all, you know, try to reach our dreams together, and

38
00:11:49,460 --> 00:12:18,460
and just, you know, like really build like a special friendship, thanks to that, and you know, it turned out to be like, it turned out to be like so amazing, you know, they're also sweet, also nice, all like so helpful when either one of us needs help, or something happens, or like looking out for each other, it's truly amazing, it makes me really happy, you know, it's amazing, I

39
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:48,460
like, I am, I really am living the dream, I really am, like my dream became truly a reality, I just feel so lucky to have such amazing gen mates, and I feel so incredibly lucky to have you in my community, because you're all just so amazing and kind and sweet to me, and that's crazy, you know, like I was not expecting

40
00:12:49,460 --> 00:13:17,460
for things to turn out like this amazingly, or like this, like overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly positive, sorry, it's hard for me to say some words, overwhelmingly positive, you know, like I just, like, let me explain, like I did not know what my community is going to be like, right, like I did not know like how it's going to develop, or

41
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:31,460
how it's going to do happen, and then like it just, all of you turned out to be just so freaking amazing and so sweet, like, how does that happen?

42
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:53,460
Okay, okay, I actually, okay, this, I don't know if I should say that, but, I don't know if I should say that, but I wanted to make like a meme, I wanted to make like a meme of like two different pictures, and the first one says,

43
00:13:53,460 --> 00:14:23,460
the first one says, me, how I felt about men, before Vealor, versus how I feel about men, after Vealor, because of you snowberries, because of you snowberries, so basically I was going to put like a picture on the first image, where I just looked pissed off at the first picture, and I was like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't

44
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:40,300
know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, so

45
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,800
Wow, some men really are amazing, huh?

46
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,800
Some men really are really, really sweet and nice.

47
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,300
Maybe not all men are trash after all.

48
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,300
Some are really, really sweet.

49
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,300
But yeah, so thank you for that.

50
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:08,300
Thank you for being so amazing that you were able to change my mind.

51
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,300
You can call me trash if you want.

52
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,300
I don't know about that. I don't know. I would feel really bad.

53
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,300
Because you're all so sweet.

54
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,300
You know, I see the reasons reflect what I see shows to us.

55
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,300
You're so sweet, I see. No. You're so sweet.

56
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,300
I genuinely mean it, though.

57
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:46,300
After talking to all of you and seeing how kind you are

58
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:52,300
and caring and sweet towards me, I was like, damn.

59
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:59,300
Okay, so maybe not all men are trash after all.

60
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:07,300
Some men really can be sweet and nice and kind, you know?

61
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:14,300
And it's nice. I don't know how to word it.

62
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,300
But basically what I'm trying to say is that I love you

63
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,300
and you're so amazing that you made me change my mind.

64
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,300
So I hope that makes sense.

65
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,300
You give up great vibes.

66
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
I can tell you're not a sweet kind of person.

67
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,300
Oh, thank you. Thank you. I try to be.

68
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:45,300
But I can be a bitch sometimes, I think.

69
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,300
I don't know.

70
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,300
Okay, so you know how you say that?

71
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,300
You think that I'm like a sweet person and stuff?

72
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,300
I don't know why, but whenever people tell me

73
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,300
that they think I'm very sweet or nice, it kind of scares me.

74
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,300
Not like scares me.

75
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Okay, scares is a strong word.

76
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,300
It's a strong word.

77
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,300
I don't know if that's the word I would use.

78
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,300
It's more like...

79
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,300
I think it's like when people worry,

80
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,300
maybe worry is a better word.

81
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
Yeah, maybe.

82
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,300
So sometimes it worries me or scares me

83
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,300
because I am like...

84
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,300
How do I word this?

85
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,300
Like I know what I want to say,

86
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,300
but I don't know how to word it or explain it

87
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
in a way that makes sense.

88
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,300
Basically, when people call me very nice

89
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,300
or super nice or super sweet,

90
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,300
my brain is like...

91
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,300
My brain is like,

92
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,300
no, I don't want you to think that

93
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,300
because every person has their moments.

94
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,300
Every person is going to have their bad days

95
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,300
or days when they're not all that sweet,

96
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,300
or they get angry or they get mean

97
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,300
or like...

98
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,300
I don't know.

99
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,300
Do you know what I'm trying to...

100
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
I don't know if it makes sense

101
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
what I'm trying to explain.

102
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,300
I hope it does.

103
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,300
But I don't know if it makes any sense.

104
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
You don't want to disappoint them

105
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,300
if they think you're always nice.

106
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,300
Maybe that's part of it.

107
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,300
But I also like...

108
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,300
I guess I don't want people to have the expectations

109
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,300
or think that I'm perfect

110
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,300
because no one is perfect.

111
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,300
Everyone deals with their shit.

112
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,300
Everyone has their...

113
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:51,300
not so great sides and stuff like that.

114
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,300
But what's important is that...

115
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,300
What's important is that the good stuff

116
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
overwhelm the bad, basically.

117
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,300
Basically that there's more good than bad

118
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,300
or that the good is stronger than the bad.

119
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
I don't know if that makes sense.

120
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,300
Doesn't make sense.

121
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
Outweight, maybe?

122
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,300
Overpower, maybe?

123
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,300
Do you see what I'm trying to explain?

124
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,300
I feel like I'm maybe like a mother.

125
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,300
I don't know.

126
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
I don't know.

127
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,300
I don't know.

128
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,300
I don't know.

129
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,300
I don't know.

130
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,300
I don't know.

131
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,300
I feel like I'm maybe like a...

132
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,300
I have trouble wording stuff

133
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,300
that I want to say sometimes.

134
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,300
Makes sense, yes.

135
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,300
Doesn't?

136
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,300
Okay, that's good.

137
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,300
I'm glad to hear that.

138
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Because basically that's what I'm trying to say.

139
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
You...

140
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,300
We all have our different sides

141
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,300
and different parts of us

142
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
that aren't so great.

143
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,300
I do too, you know?

144
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,300
I do too, you know?

145
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,300
Even if you see me

146
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,300
only the sweet sides of me all the time

147
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,300
or all the good parts of me,

148
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,300
that doesn't mean that...

149
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,300
I don't have those bad parts either,

150
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,300
because I do and everyone does.

151
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
But when it comes to love,

152
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:25,300
it's about loving the person

153
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,300
despite the bad stuff

154
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,300
and that the good overpowers

155
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,300
any of those other stuff

156
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
that might be bad

157
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,300
or not ideal, I guess.

158
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,300
You know?

159
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,300
Sorry for the big yap.

160
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
I'm sorry for the big yap.

161
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:53,300
I feel like I'm being too serious or something.

162
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,300
I'm sorry for being weird

163
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,300
or too serious and stuff.

164
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,300
I hope I'm explaining myself well

165
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,300
because sometimes I'm scared that I don't...

166
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,300
that I don't make sense.

167
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,300
It's from the heart, so it's okay.

168
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
Are you sure?

169
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
Are you sure?

170
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,300
I get so nervous that I'm being too much

171
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,300
or the stuff that I say are...

172
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
I don't know.

173
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,300
I'm overthinking it as always.

174
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,300
I overthink stuff a lot.

175
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
If you couldn't tell by now,

176
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,300
I overthink a lot and get paranoid sometimes

177
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,300
and just worry a lot.

178
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,300
I just want to do my very best

179
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
at the end of the day.

180
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,300
We will love, bitch.

181
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,300
I see too. Don't worry.

182
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,300
Thank you.

183
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,300
I'm glad that you will still love me

184
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,300
even when I'm being a bitch.

185
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,300
Your best is more than enough.

186
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
Thank you.

187
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,300
That means a lot to me.

188
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,300
Thank you so much.

189
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,300
I can get that way too.

190
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,300
You're not going to be so hard on yourself.

191
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,300
I'll try.

192
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,300
Time to brush up on the bread taming skills.

193
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,300
I mean, you pretty much tamed me.

194
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
I mean, let's be real.

195
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,300
You pretty much tamed me.

196
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,300
And it took just a few days.

197
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,300
If you haven't done that, so...

198
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,300
That's so fucking embarrassing.

199
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
I still can get over it. I hate it.

200
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,300
What the fuck?

201
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,300
What the fuck?

202
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,300
Why are you just doing it?

203
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,300
Although I just still like to be a bread

204
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,300
every now and then.

205
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,300
I still like to do that stuff.

206
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,300
But I'm a sweet bread.

207
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,300
I think I would consider myself a sweet bread.

208
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,300
I don't know if that even makes sense,

209
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,300
but that's the best way that I can think of it.

210
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,300
You can just love me so much that bread is really fun.

211
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,300
Aw, thank you.

212
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,300
I love you too.

213
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,300
You are just too cute.

214
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Thank you.

215
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
I'm really glad you think so.

216
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,300
I'm really glad to hear that.

217
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,300
I don't know, reading all of your kind words always

218
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,300
makes me just so happy, truly.

219
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,300
The bread is so cute.

220
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,300
Mr. may pretend to be irritated,

221
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,300
but it's just too flustered to admit he's happy.

222
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,300
Aw, that's really sweet.

223
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,300
To be honest though, to be honest though,

224
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,300
if I genuinely thought that you're like genuinely irritated with me,

225
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,300
I'm not gonna lie.

226
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,300
I would probably fucking cry.

227
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,300
I would be like fuck.

228
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,300
He fucking hates me.

229
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,300
It's so fucking over.

230
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,300
I'm gonna go KMS.

231
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,300
He doesn't love me anymore.

232
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,300
My brain just gets really fucking dramatic

233
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,300
because I overthink stuff.

234
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:34,300
You know, like, I don't know if I should even say that,

235
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,300
but I mean fuck it, fuck it.

236
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Like, I'm the type of person that like, you know,

237
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,300
that like, if I don't get like a response for a while

238
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
and stuff like that,

239
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,300
or if I talk about something

240
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,300
and you don't touch like base on it,

241
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,300
even if you like just forgot to or something,

242
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,300
my brain instantly ghost you.

243
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,300
Oh no, they don't like me as much anymore.

244
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,300
Oh no, they're falling out of love.

245
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,300
Oh no, no, it's so over.

246
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,300
No, they don't care about what I said.

247
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,300
That's why they didn't respond to it.

248
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,300
That's literally me and it's like...

249
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
It's...

250
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,300
It's something.

251
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,300
But yeah.

252
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,300
I have a problem.

253
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,300
I have a problem.

254
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,300
I relate so hard.

255
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,300
I see everything can worry so hard.

256
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,300
Yeah, I'm glad it's not just me.

257
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,300
I'm glad it's not just me though.

258
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,300
It's good to know that because like, you know,

259
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,300
it's so easy to get worried about stuff like that.

260
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,300
You know, like...

261
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,300
It's just...

262
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,300
I don't know.

263
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,300
It's overwhelming, I guess.

264
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,300
And when you're an over-thinker,

265
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,300
and you're like me, then like,

266
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,300
it gets like, you know, brain-worms and stuff and...

267
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,300
But I try like...

268
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,300
I really try my best though to like,

269
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,300
not to think that way.

270
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,300
Like, anytime that I get worried about stuff like that,

271
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:32,300
I try to force myself and tell myself that that's not the case.

272
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,300
And that, you know,

273
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,300
either you're busy,

274
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,300
or either you didn't see what I wrote,

275
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,300
or you forgot to talk about something,

276
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,300
or et cetera, et cetera,

277
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,300
or you will touch base on it later,

278
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,300
or you will respond.

279
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,300
Or like, you know, like I'm trying to like,

280
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,300
stop being like...

281
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,300
Like stop thinking worst-case scenario, I guess,

282
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:05,300
and learn to rewire my brain to think like,

283
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,300
best-case scenario.

284
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,300
Like, and not instantly like,

285
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,300
go to the bad extreme side of things.

286
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,300
And it's hard, and it's hard because,

287
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,300
you know, your brain is wired like a certain way

288
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,300
for a long time.

289
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,300
So once you try to rewire it,

290
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,300
like, you literally like, have to like,

291
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,300
literally just force yourself to think a certain way.

292
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,300
And only after you do it long enough,

293
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,300
it slowly starts like,

294
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,300
you know, getting better.

295
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,300
I see the secret is that we sometimes get that way too,

296
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,300
so no worries.

297
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,300
I'm glad to hear that in a way.

298
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,300
Like, I am not glad that you feel that way,

299
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,300
because I mean, let's be honest,

300
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,300
feeling like that is always shit.

301
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,300
Feeling like that is always bad, right?

302
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,300
Like, it's never a good feeling to feel like that.

303
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,300
But when I say I'm glad you feel that way,

304
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,300
I mean it as in, I'm glad that...

305
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,300
It's not just me who feels like that,

306
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,300
if that makes sense.

307
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,300
Like, I'm glad that like,

308
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,300
it's not just me who like,

309
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,300
you know, over things.

310
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,300
You aren't that crazy yet.

311
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,300
I mean, you don't know that.

312
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,300
What if I am?

313
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,300
You don't know me?

314
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,300
What if I am?

315
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,300
No, my crazy is contained.

316
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,300
I take medication.

317
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,300
I take meds.

318
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,300
My crazy is contained

319
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,300
as much as it can be anyways.

320
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,300
There's only so much meds can do.

321
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,300
There's only so much meds can do,

322
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,300
you know, they keep me as stable as I can be,

323
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,300
basically, so yeah.

324
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,300
So, shout out to my meds.

325
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,300
Me too, she's just like me for real, for real.

326
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,300
We don't want it contained.

327
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,300
Oh, trust me, it's...

328
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,300
It's really bad if I don't have my meds.

329
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,300
It's best for myself and everyone else,

330
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,300
but I do take my meds, to be honest.

331
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,300
Otherwise, my...

332
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,300
Yeah, so...

333
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,300
Wow, this is you on meds?

334
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,300
Yeah, this is me on meds.

335
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,300
I always do what's best for yourself.

336
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,300
Yeah, that's exactly it.

337
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,300
I'm glad that I have meds that work for me.

338
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,300
It took me like a few years to actually find

339
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,300
something that works properly for me.

340
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,300
I feel bad.

341
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,300
I feel like I'm trauma dumping on you right now.

342
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,300
Am I trauma dumping?

343
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,300
Fuck, I should just stop.

344
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,300
I feel so bad.

345
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,300
Am I trauma dumping right now?

346
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,300
I can't tell.

347
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,300
Like, I'm just trying to like talk with you

348
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,300
and, you know, get to know each other better

349
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,300
and get closer, I guess.

350
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,300
But I don't know if I'm trauma dumping.

351
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,300
Maybe I should just play the game and shut up.

352
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,300
No, you're not. It's fine, darling.

353
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,300
No, it's perfectly okay. I keep talking.

354
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,300
No, we're just bonding.

355
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,300
Okay, okay, okay.

356
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,300
I'm just making sure.

357
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,300
I'm just making sure.

358
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,300
Because when I talk about this stuff,

359
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,300
it's my way to bond with you, I guess.

360
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,300
Like, having you get to know me better, you know?

361
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,300
So, your anxiety is getting to you.

362
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,300
It's not trauma dumping.

363
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,300
Why would we consider trauma dumping, then?

364
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,300
Now I'm scared.

365
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,300
Now I'm scared.

366
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,300
What if I accidentally start trauma dumping, though?

367
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,300
That's so bad!

368
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,300
Oh, no!

369
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,300
I see this isn't trauma dumping.

370
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,300
Saying I take meds for health isn't dumping.

371
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,300
Yeah, who am I talking about, nearly?

372
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,300
It's an unhealthy term, honestly.

373
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,300
Usually sharing trauma with friends is helpful.

374
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,300
Okay, okay.

375
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,300
Okay, listen, I agree.

376
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,300
You know what? I agree.

377
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,300
Can I just say that I kind of agree?

378
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,300
Like...

379
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,300
Like, if you talk to your friends,

380
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,300
or people that are close to you,

381
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,300
and you tell them that stuff,

382
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,300
I don't think that's trauma dumping.

383
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,300
Like...

384
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,300
You know?

385
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,300
I feel like that's a way to bond with someone

386
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,300
and be there for them.

387
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,300
Like, yeah, if a random...

388
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,300
It's trauma dumping, if it's a random person

389
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,300
that I don't fucking know at all.

390
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,300
Just going outside, I'm sitting at a bench,

391
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,300
and...

392
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,300
Someone random sits next to me,

393
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,300
and they're like telling me their life trauma.

394
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,300
Like, you know?

395
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,300
You know?

396
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,300
Like, okay, like...

397
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,300
Yeah.

398
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,300
The term, like many others, is way to overuse these days.

399
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,300
People call any sort of emotional talk trauma dumping these days.

400
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,300
Okay, that's so true.

401
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,300
I completely agree.

402
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,300
Yeah, I completely agree with that.

403
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,300
That is so true.

404
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,300
I agree.

405
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,300
There's a lot of terms that are getting, like, overused,

406
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,300
and people, like, don't even know, like,

407
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,300
the real meaning behind them anymore.

408
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,300
We care about you, so we want to talk about this stuff.

409
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,300
Yeah, language gets weird, yeah.

410
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,300
I agree.

411
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:07,300
I feel like it gets weirder the more time goes.

412
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,300
Like, there's always, like, new terms popping up,

413
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,300
and I'm just, like, pro...

414
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:19,300
Can we just, like, talk normally like we used to years ago?

415
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,300
I'm okay with hearing you talk about anything.

416
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,300
Okay, that's good to know.

417
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,300
Heavy words being used too lightly.

418
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,300
Yeah, exactly!

419
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,300
Okay, literally that, though, like, using heavy words

420
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:40,300
and using them way too often and, like, too lightly.

421
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,300
Like, brah, you know?

422
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:47,300
Like, not every single fucking thing is trauma dumping, okay?

423
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,300
It took me too long to learn what risk was.

424
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,300
Okay, same, same!

425
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,300
That's, it's not just you, it's not just you.

426
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,300
Same.

427
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:02,300
After the longest time when I saw the word, like, risk going around,

428
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,300
I was like, what the fuck does that shit even mean?

429
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,300
What the fuck is risk?

430
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,300
Like, there's all this, like, fucking zoomer fucking terms,

431
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,300
and I'm just like, bro, what?

432
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,300
What the fuck is what?

433
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,300
I sit up to your risler.

434
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,300
I don't, I don't know, I don't know if I am.

435
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,300
I don't know if I am.

436
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,300
I don't know if you remember, but my experience with Rufus

437
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,300
in Rockstar Simulator wasn't very good.

438
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,300
I don't think I had much risk at all.

439
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,300
Oh my god.

440
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,300
Maybe I see what's the realer she said after all.

441
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,300
Fuck you, I'm not!

442
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,300
I'm a baby.

443
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,300
Fuck you.

444
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,300
Just for, just, okay, listen.

445
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,300
Just for calling me that, just for calling me that.

446
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,300
I'm no longer gonna call you dadda.

447
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,300
I'm just gonna call you a bitch from now.

448
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:08,300
If you say that to me, you are not my dadda, okay?

449
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,300
If you call me that, you are no longer my daddy.

450
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,300
Bye.

451
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,300

Be right back, but gotta get mad.

455
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,300
No, don't do that.

456
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,300
No, don't kill yourself.

457
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,300

461
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,300
It's funny to me cause it's true.

462
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:05,300
It's funny to me cause some people literally would say stuff like that to you.

463
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,300
It's funny cause it's true.

464
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,300
Some people generally would say that to you.

465
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:17,300
Like some people like you're gonna like tell them like you're depressed or something.

466
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,300
And their response is gonna be like you can't be depressed here.

467
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,300
Too beautiful for that.

468
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,300
What do you mean?

469
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
What do you mean?

470
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,300
That's not how my brain works.

471
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:38,300
No, my battery is low on my tracking.

472
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,300
Fuck, I need to charge it.

473
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,300
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

474
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,300
Give me a moment.

475
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,300
I need to be right back and put my phone on charger.

476
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,300
Or I'm not gonna have my tracking anymore.

477
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,300

I was muted!

575
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,300
No!

576
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,300
What the fuck?

577
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,300
Okay, so now I have to say that all over again.

578
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,300
Oh my god, I hate this shit.

579
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,300
I was saying I'm so sorry for taking so long,

580
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,300
because I put in the charger

581
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,300
and it wasn't charging, so I was freaking out.

582
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,300
And as I was freaking out,

583
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,300
I accidentally like bruised my knee

584
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,300
because I hit it against something like a dumbass.

585
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,300
So ow.

586
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,300
Anyways,

587
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,300
that should be fine.

588
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,300
That shouldn't be a problem now.

589
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,300
It is charging now.

590
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,300
It is charging now.

591
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,300
I'm fine.

592
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,300
Time to kiss it better.

593
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,300
Yeah, kiss it better for me.

594
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,300
That would make me happy.

595
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,300
Kiss it better to make the bruise go away.

596
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,300
Kiss it better to make the bruise go away.

597
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,300
Please be careful.

598
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,300
I tried.

599
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,300
I'm okay though.

600
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,300
I'm just being a baby about it to be honest.

601
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,300
It's fine.

602
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,300
Thank you.

603
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,300
Thank you for all the kisses.

604
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,300
Or maybe add more bruises.

605
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,300
I mean,

606
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,300
that depends.

607
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,300
Only in certain situations.

608
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,300
It has to be a bruise of love.

609
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,300
It has to be a bruise of love, you know?

610
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,300
It can just be like anything.

611
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,300
So you're saying,

612
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,300
yeah.

613
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,300
Yeah, hickeys.

614
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,300
So that everyone knows that I belong to you.

615
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,300
Like your way

616
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,300
of marking me.

617
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,300
Maybe a little red bottom.

618
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,300
Yeah!

619
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,300
I want like your hand print.

620
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,300
Left on my bottoms.

621
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,300
That's how hard

622
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,300
I want you to do it.

623
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,300
I want you to do it like so strongly

624
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,300
that it leaves

625
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,300
like a mark

626
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,300
of your hand.

627
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,300
I would love that.

628
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,300
And also for it, you know,

629
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,300
to sting a bit

630
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,300
for a few minutes or so.

631
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,300
Because then the stinging

632
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,300
from the pain

633
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,300
reminds me

634
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,300
who I belong to.

635
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,300
You know?

636
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,300
Fuck!

637
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,300
I'm being so down bad already.

638
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,300
What the fuck?

639
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,300
I'm just chatting stream.

640
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,300
I'm just being down bad.

641
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,300
What the fuck?

642
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,300
I'm so sorry.

643
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,300
And then we can kiss it

644
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,300
to make it better, right?

645
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,300
Of course!

646
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,300
That would be very nice.

647
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,300
I feel really bad

648
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,300
because I have been streaming

649
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,300
for almost an hour

650
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,300
and I still didn't start playing the game.

651
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,300
Please tell me

652
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,300
if you want me to start the game.

653
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,300
Don't worry, you can tell me.

654
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,300
We like the chatting.

655
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,300
Please just talk more.

656
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,300
Yeah, I think you speak.

657
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,300
I know, but I'm supposed to play the game.

658
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,300
Whenever you want, don't worry.

659
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,300
I guess I'm scared

660
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,300
because I've been yapping for like an hour.

661
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,300
Almost an hour.

662
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,300
So I'm like, I know.

663
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,300
Also it's getting pretty hot in here.

664
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,300
Let me turn on my fan.

665
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,300
I feel better already.

666
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,300
Sorry, it was getting really hot in my room

667
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,300
so I had to turn my fan on.

668
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,300
And by fan, I mean you.

669
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,300
You're the fan that I turn on.

670
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,300
Fuck, I'm so cringe!

671
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,300
I'm so cringe.

672
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,300
What the fuck is my problem?

673
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,300
I need to turn my fan on.

674
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,300
My...

675
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,300
my small cringe wife!

676
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,300
Oh no.

677
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,300
RIS 100.

678
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,300
More like RIS minus 100.

679
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,300
That's how I feel right now.

680
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,300
You're very good at it.

681
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,300
Thank you, I'm glad you think so.

682
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,300
Okay, I can defend on what I see.

683
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,300

Oh my god.

713
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,680
I said we're gonna need to move to another site in this raid.

714
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,680
Oh no, no, no, bro, imagine.

715
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:03,680
Okay, listen, imagine I get fucking demonetized tomorrow

716
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,680
because of this fucking stream.

717
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:17,680
Imagine the demonetization stream celebration, oh my fucking god.

718
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,680
I love this cob, I love this mister.

719
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,680
No stopping, is that for another session of fun?

720
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,680
Okay, let's fucking go.

721
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:43,680
Oh, we love, we all love this cob and I love all of you.

722
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,680
Same for us though.

723
00:48:52,680 --> 00:49:02,680
I'm flattered, really, I'm flattered that you can feel that way about me even though I'm being so fucking cringe most of the time.

724
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,680
And weird, I don't know.

725
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,680
YouTube, here's your monetization, reviews later stream.

726
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,680
Our second thought, let me get that back.

727
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,680
Bro, that would be so fucking bad.

728
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,680
That's why we're here.

729
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,680
Why?

730
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,680
Why are you here?

731
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,680
What is my problem?

732
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,680
Not me, literally asking you.

733
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,680
Okay, well why are you here?

734
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,680
Why are you here?

735
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,680
Just to suffer.

736
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,680
Why are you just to suffer?

737
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,680
That's terrible, I didn't want to suffer, I didn't want to be happy.

738
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:04,680
Holy fuck, for you Brad, that's so sweet.

739
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:13,680
Because you're unhinged, I'm glad you like how unhinged I am, thank you.

740
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,680
Why are we still here just to tease Icy?

741
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,680
I mean, that's fun.

742
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,680
We're here for Icy, let's be real.

743
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:35,680
I think that's very sweet if you are here for me because you genuinely like my company and like hanging out with me.

744
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,680
That is like the best compliment to be honest.

745
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:48,680
Because you know, some people only watch some stuff or only specific content that you make.

746
00:50:48,680 --> 00:51:07,680
So when people like watch everything that you do because they genuinely like you and like your personality and everything around it, then that is like I feel like the best like biggest form of like a compliment for me.

747
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:23,680
So for those of you that are here and you know, say that you are here for me and stuff and all of that, thank you.

748
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,680
I really do appreciate it because it means a lot to me.

749
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:33,680
It means a lot to me and that's what I always wanted to be honest.

750
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:54,680
But I always wanted, like I always really wanted to, you know, people watch my streams and be here no matter what I do, you know, no matter if I play a game or just stock for people to be here because they genuinely just like my company, you know.

751
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:02,680
And that really means a lot to me because for me it's like whenever I stream, you know, it's like time for us to all like have fun.

752
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:12,680
Have some quality time together and hang out and do fun stuff and talk and, you know, so I really like it.

753
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,680
You make everything fun.

754
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,680
Oh, thank you.

755
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,680
I'm flattered, really, thank you.

756
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,680
And you're watching, you know, I'm sure I'm best to be here for streams.

757
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:29,680
Oh, thank you, but don't feel pressured.

758
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,680
Please don't feel pressured to be here.

759
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:41,680
You know, only be here if you genuinely want to, like don't be here because you feel bad for me or something, I guess, you know.

760
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,680
I could listen to you all day.

761
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,680
Oh, that's really sweet.

762
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,680
I'm glad to hear that.

763
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:58,680
I only get to every stream, I'll put stream on my cars because if I gotta, oh, the dedication, that's so sweet.

764
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,680
I want to be here.

765
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,680
I'm glad, I'm glad to hear that.

766
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,680
Done.

767
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,680
Let me drink some water.

768
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:15,680
My throat is getting a little bit sore from all the talking.

769
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,680
I wasn't expecting to be talking this much.

770
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:23,680
Like that wasn't the plan, but you make it so fun, you know.

771
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,680
You genuinely make it so fun to talk, like I could just talk and talk.

772
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,680
I'm glad to hear that.

773
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,680

That's much better.

786
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,680
I really needed that water.

787
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,680
Drink slowly, Princess.

788
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,680
I'm sorry, I was, I was so fricking thirsty.

789
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,680
I didn't realize how thirsty I was until I started drinking the water.

790
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,680
So I started fucking chugging it.

791
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,680
This is why I'm here.

792
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,680

Your point being I

816
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,480
Forgot

817
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:35,400
I forgot what was my what was the point I'm trying to get with I forgot what I said to be honest. Oh

818
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,400
No, my memory is

819
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,760
bad

820
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,760
Why is my memory so f***ing bad?

821
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,760
What the f***

822
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:55,720
I was literally just talking about it. What was I talking about?

823
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,040
Um

824
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,040
Of the icinate, I guess

825
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,080
But but what was I talking about specific?

826
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,600
F***

827
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,240
F***

828
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,400
Hell

829
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:23,720
We're a digit as f***, but we're also very wholesome. I feel like that's the best honestly

830
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:27,880
That's the best right like it's not just me or things that right like

831
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:34,440
Like it like if you're a digit at the generate, but you're also like wholesome and

832
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,840
and

833
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,960
Like and at the generate was in love, you know

834
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,760
Like that's like the best

835
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:50,280
To the sides of the same coin. Yeah, exactly best combo. Yeah, I agree

836
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:00,360
It's so cute how hype she gets with the yapping I can't help it. I'm genuinely like

837
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,280
I'm genuinely just having so much fun. Just talking to you right now

838
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,480
Not gonna lie. I'm just having fun

839
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,960
Talking to you and I'm responding to you and just

840
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,480
Just hanging out

841
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,560
Just talking about

842
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,720
Whatever whatever comes next, I guess

843
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:27,320
It's fun talking to you too. I'm glad you think so

844
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:35,800
I'm glad you think so, but I but I will admit like I do feel a bit bad, but I just still didn't start playing like I don't want to be annoying

845
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,840
What comes next? I mean, hopefully you

846
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,760
Hopefully you

847
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,960
You first no, no you first

848
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,040
Thank you for no

849
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,840
No you first

850
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,400
Why not both at the same time?

851
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:12,600
Okay, that would be that would be ideal. Yeah, that would be ideal

852
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,480
No you first

853
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:27,960
We gotta take care of our baby. Oh, that's really sweet both

854
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,760
Both is good

855
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,240
No you

856
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,800
No you come first

857
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,960
No you come first

858
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:44,280
Together just feels better. Yeah, that is true

859
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:51,160
That is like that's like that would be like so romantic right that would be like peak romance

860
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,960
But I feel like that's also like

861
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Difficult to make it happen

862
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,800
I

863
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,600
Just be like wouldn't that be like difficult to make it happen

864
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,120
Countdown no

865
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:22,360
My god, what are we talking about this is fucking youtube

866
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,920
Not if you know the right spells, well, what what are the right spells?

867
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,720
Please do tell me I'm very I'm very intrigued

868
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:48,840
If you love the person and I feel make it work. Okay, that's also true. I agree with that

869
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,480
It does require some good timing

870
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,720
I

871
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:05,720
Mean there is no alternative not so for extremely sorry for viola right not at the moment, but

872
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:12,920
The plan is to have that like to have like another platform

873
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,360
For you know when we want to get like extra unhinged

874
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:24,440
I said that as if I'm not being unhinged already like right fucking now with talking about all this stuff

875
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:34,520
You'd be surprised what love based will power can do I agree the power of love is is truly strong

876
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,280
Sorry I keep muting myself I keep like having to clear my throat

877
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,920
The f1 or the c1

878
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,520
The the f1 the f1 I believe

879
01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:00,840
I feel like I feel like the plan is definitely like the f1

880
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:10,840
That's the best part clearing throat ASMR is it I feel like that's

881
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:17,240
I feel like that's like not a pleasant sound to listen to like just hearing clear my fucking throat like

882
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:21,320
Whenever I play a game like I can't mute myself

883
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,360
So you do hear and clear my throat a lot, but

884
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:30,120
While we're chatting I can actually mute myself like when they clear my throat. So I guess it's like

885
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:35,880
The nice thing but I don't know if it's I don't know if I need to clear my throat so much because I talk so much

886
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:43,560
Like is that I feel like that's part of it like when I don't talk I don't feel like I need to clear my throat this often

887
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:47,320
Wait, this is not your full power. No, it's not

888
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,880
I become much much more

889
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,480
Powerful this is not my final form

890
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:02,360
I see needs to take up her power limiter I will eventually I will I will eventually

891
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:10,440
I mean I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine

892
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,680
I

893
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:19,480
Mean I'm already doing like a lot of stuff that you know, I really did not think I would be doing so

894
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,760
That's already like

895
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,760
A big thing on its own for myself

896
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:30,840
It's time to go even further behind. Yes, I agree

897
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:35,560
She will distress when her power is unleashed. Okay, I'll be honest. I don't know if that's even true

898
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:41,000
I don't know if it's even true because okay to be honest like like, yeah, you know, I

899
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:46,440
Like yeah, that's the plan to like have some streams like on the other side

900
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,640
The f side

901
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:55,880
Side fuck. I can't talk but like like realistically speaking the way that I know myself

902
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,520
I will be fine

903
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:05,400
I will be really fucking shy like I really don't know how what's gonna happen

904
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,920
Because I will be I feel like I'll be like

905
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,680
Really like extra shy and stuff because it's like

906
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,800
it's very different than

907
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:23,880
When you just record yourself and you're not talking to anyone

908
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,880
You know

909
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,480
So

910
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:35,000
I don't know how good it's gonna be like I don't even know what to expect like I don't even know what's gonna happen

911
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,480
I will be I will say that because

912
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:44,200
You know for all I know I would get so shy that like my body just fucking freezes, you know

913
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,800
Like that could happen as well. Who knows

914
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:53,480
So I don't want to like make any promises like I don't want you to have like high expectations of me

915
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,560
When it comes to that because again, I don't know how my body's gonna react like

916
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,840
When stuff like that actually will happen

917
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:05,080
Because I might just get so shy and nervous that it just frees up

918
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,080
So I feel like it will probably just like

919
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,680
Lead up to it maybe

920
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,360
With with time or stuff like that

921
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,800
It's okay, just do what you feel comfortable with doing

922
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,320
Thank you. Thank you for being understanding about that

923
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,880
Oh, it's all good got your own pace

924
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,760
Yeah, thank you

925
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,320
Thank you for being understanding about it and

926
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,160
Not like I guess pressuring me about it because

927
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,160
Because you know like

928
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:50,200
Being pressured about it would just like make it a lot worse and make the anxiety like

929
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,400
Even more about

930
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:01,720
Just do what makes you comfortable. I see. Yeah, I I will I will

931
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,760
Because if I'm not comfortable then

932
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,120
It's it's not gonna be good for anyone

933
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:15,160
Oh, these things will make you feel comfortable. That's that's what I'm hoping for

934
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,960
That's what I'm hoping for like

935
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,520
Like in the ideal scenario like

936
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,080
Even if I am nervous

937
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,280
And really shy about it

938
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,520
You'll be able to like

939
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,680
Make me really comfortable about it

940
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:38,760
And stuff like that, but the things you say to me and how how sweet you are to me

941
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:45,480
That's I guess that's like what I'm hoping for but I get I don't know how I'm going to react

942
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:55,080
I'll be by your side supporting your art, baby. Oh, that's really sweet

943
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,960
I can imagine here ice using an ice cube

944
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:09,640
I'm going to have to throw a sickie or something for that first f stream if I am at work

945
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:15,160
Oh, wow the dedication. Oh my god, that would be so funny imagine. I'm like announcing

946
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,360
My first like f stream

947
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:23,240
And all of you just take a day of work in that fat

948
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:29,000
Oh my god, that would be fucking crazy

949
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:34,040
The amount of dedication is insane

950
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,920
We'll need the whole day maybe a week

951
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,640
A whole week

952
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,440
Let's go

953
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,240
One week stream on the f side

954
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,240
Oh god

955
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,760
I have some overtime saved up so I could take a day off or two

956
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,880
That's nice

957
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,680
Worth it

958
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,040
A lot of us would definitely do it if needed

959
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:17,960
I feel like that's I feel like that's pretty pretty cute like pretty sweet, you know

960
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:24,760
If you would like take the day off just for that, you know, that's really sweet

961
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,400
Woo f side and stream

962
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,960
Oh, no

963
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:38,520
You always speaking speaking of f side speaking of f side, you know what I want to do eventually

964
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:44,040
You know what I want to do eventually I want to like do like a spankathon or something like that

965
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,600
like I want to get a paddle and

966
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:51,960
For like every like tip or something I just smack myself

967
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,440
In the bot but like a paddle

968
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,800
So it would be like a spankathon

969
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,600
I always thought like that would be like a really fun idea

970
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,880
Send it send what

971
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,600
Send what

972
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:20,120
You might break. I don't know. I'm I think I can do it

973
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,440
I think I can do it

974
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,280
Oh, that sounds nice. It sounds fun, right?

975
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,840
Right like that's it's fun

976
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:35,160
Like like before I even like joined the allure. I actually like wrote

977
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,240
In my application when they asked about like

978
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,040
Ideas I was actually like

979
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:46,040
I think it would be really cool if we did like a spankathon or something like that

980
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:51,400
So I already like back then like already like I had the idea to do it send it do it

981
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:58,760
Okay, well, I'm sorry. Okay. I'm dumb sometimes you say stuff and I don't know what you mean. Okay. I'm sorry. Okay

982
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,400
This is a premium idea. Thank you. I'm glad you think so

983
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,360
I think that would be really fun

984
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,400
and then you'll get to

985
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,560
hear me just

986
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,200
suffer and

987
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,160
Smack my bottoms

988
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,400
Until they sting so much

989
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,440
It's unbearable

990
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,960
I think a few jissens would go overboard

991
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,640
I will need to think smartly about it like

992
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:45,720
I will need to think smartly about it definitely can't it can't cannot

993
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:53,560
Be one dollar because I would fucking die like like assuming that people like will go crazy

994
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,480
I don't want to risk that you know, I don't want to risk that you know

995
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,920
Like I would just spankathon, but I also want to like

996
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,400
Be able to still sit on my ass after it, you know

997
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I don't know what I mean

998
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,600
What's the minimum

999
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,000
I don't know

1000
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,560
Honestly, I have no idea. I'm scared like I generally don't know what would be like

1001
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:27,080
A minimum for that. I'm I'm scared of making it like too low and then like someone just goes fucking crazy

1002
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,680
You know like that would be so bad

1003
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:40,200
Okay, but what's it like this spankathon if you can sit right after well if I can't sit

1004
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:45,960
Like for a few days because of it that means I can't really string because I'll be like

1005
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,760
paying from sitting

1006
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,960
One of the other girls may have some thoughts. Yeah

1007
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:59,880
Okay, you're right. Yeah, that is true. I could ask I could probably ask scrawny about it and ask her

1008
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,840
Opinion what she thinks would be good

1009
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,960
That's not a bad idea at all

1010
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,800
Here's your tip

1011
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,880
Thanks for your tip

1012
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,720
Thanks, you know what I

1013
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,880
Very nice

1014
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,680
Oh

1015
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,120
My god

1016
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:45,320
Your floating skills are amazing. Are you being sarcastic? I I can't tell if you're being sarcastic

1017
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:50,840
Or if you genuinely mean it. I I can't tell if you're just being sarcastic when you say that

1018
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,520
He may be sarcastic, but I mean it

1019
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,480
But mean what

1020
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:10,280
That I have Riz or do you mean something else? No, he's genuine. Really? Do you think so?

1021
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,640
She has accidental Riz

1022
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,400
Uh, apparently according to you

1023
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:26,440
You could do light slabs for low amounts and heavier ones for big donuts. Oh, that's actually

1024
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,320
That's something to think about wait

1025
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:36,200
Wait, that is something to think about that's actually maybe that would be a good idea

1026
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:42,680
Hmm, is it a good idea? What what do the rest of you think about it?

1027
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,880
Do you think it's a good idea if for light slabs

1028
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:52,280
For low amounts and heavier ones for big donuts?

1029
01:13:53,080 --> 01:14:00,120
Like like if it's like a low amount like a smaller amount I slap it with my hand and

1030
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:05,960
And if it's like a high amount I slap it with like an actual like

1031
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,200
paddle

1032
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:11,880
You know like an actual like paddle that will like hurt

1033
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:20,200
Definitely better than a heavy slap for all donuts. Yeah, I think maybe that would make it more fun too

1034
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,040
I don't know

1035
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,280
Hahaha

1036
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,080
Sounds fun sounds good

1037
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:37,960
What is going on just got back from dinner? Oh god

1038
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,240
um

1039
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,200
Um

1040
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,520
I mean, I don't even know how to tell you

1041
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,760
Someone someone let let him know

1042
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:52,840
Someone let him know what we're talking about because because I don't know how to

1043
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,800
I don't know how to easily explain

1044
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:02,840
Kino stream brainstorming and flirting session

1045
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:09,160
Spanko who's gonna tell him does he know

1046
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,160
Does he know

1047
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,520
Oh

1048
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,160
My god

1049
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,240
He doesn't know no he doesn't

1050
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,640
Only the real ones will know this

1051
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:44,200
Guys remind me again that we went to a gameplay stream to a zazoo to spank

1052
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:49,880
Yes, we did and you know what I think that's amazing

1053
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,240
I think that's amazing

1054
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:58,840
I love that we can just do whatever I love that we can just do whatever I love that

1055
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,880
We can just talk

1056
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,960
And and have fun doing just that

1057
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,160
You know, I think it's really nice

1058
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,240
I

1059
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:13,800
See still confused, but I see wait, what what are you confused about like?

1060
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,800
What what are you exactly confused about?

1061
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:22,040
This is why I do my best to tune in live whenever I can

1062
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:26,520
Yeah, because because if you're not if you're not here when it's live

1063
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,640
Then you know, you you will feel like the

1064
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:31,880
FOMO

1065
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:37,080
Really hard I guess and I feel bad for it because like I know there's people who like want to watch

1066
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:41,480
Me live, but they can't because of time zones and schedules and stuff

1067
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:45,960
And I feel so sad for them, you know, like it makes me sad because it's like

1068
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:52,760
It's like fuck. I wish I could like just make everyone happy, you know, but I know that

1069
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:54,840
realistically I

1070
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:59,400
I can't do that. I can do my best to try and make

1071
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,920
Many happy I guess but

1072
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:08,040
I can I'm not going to be able to appeal to like every single person

1073
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,320
Sadly, like, you know, I wish I could but

1074
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,280
uh

1075
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:17,160
I'm just a tiny little cop who is trying her best

1076
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:23,800
Our

1077
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,800
Vital physics

1078
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,800
Are pretty hard to get on. What is our vital physics?

1079
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:35,400
Our vital physics are vital. I probably mispronouncing and they sound like a fucking idiot

1080
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:39,080
Our vital physics. Yeah, how do you say?

1081
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,720
Byte L

1082
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,880
So, so did I say it right? Vital

1083
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:51,320
Byte L, is that what you say? Vital physics

1084
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,040
Bit L

1085
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,040
Bit L

1086
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,280
Bit L

1087
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:03,880
You all write different stuff. I don't know which one is correct

1088
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,400
I don't know which one is correct

1089
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,760
Bit L

1090
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,720
Bit L

1091
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,720
Basically space physics

1092
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,800
Ah

1093
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:26,120
Okay, space physics. Well, just say space physics that I'm too stupid to know

1094
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:31,400
Complicated words like that. I'm just a cop. You can't just be like

1095
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,880
vital

1096
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:38,920
Something something I'm I'm too little for that. I don't know what the fuck that means

1097
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,920
Just just see your simple words and say

1098
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,680
Space physics

1099
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:52,120
She's just a cop. I'm just learning, okay

1100
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:59,000
Well, we were talking about time zone so song so

1101
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,880
Yeah, I'm sorry, sweetie

1102
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:04,280
Okay, I forgive you

1103
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:07,480
English is hard man, but you're harder

1104
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:25,160
Yeah, I am nice

1105
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:28,520
Guilty as charged. Oh wow

1106
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:34,280
Can I see

1107
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,280
Can I can I watch

1108
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,080
Hahaha

1109
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:57,240
Can I can I see you I'll spread those legs for me

1110
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,240
Yeah

1111
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:22,440
I see a good baby girl. Yeah, I'm very good

1112
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:28,840
I am I'm the happiest I've ever been to be honest

1113
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,840
I see you've been in heat for a while, huh? Yeah

1114
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,760
Can you not tell

1115
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:46,200
Please to this and I'm gonna die of laughter. Please. No don't die

1116
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,240
No dying allowed in here

1117
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,120
Please so weak. Yeah

1118
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:55,160
At least so weak. That's true

1119
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,640
I see is always in heat

1120
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:01,640
That's what it feels like lately. That's what it feels like

1121
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,440
Like this past week

1122
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,960
Kind of running that I see is in heat

1123
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:09,960
Yeah, cuz

1124
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,760
Of all like the ice and snow themes

1125
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,000
But all of that stuff just melted because of you

1126
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:26,840
I see is melting. Oh, no, no

1127
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,600
It's so over

1128
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,880
I've turned you into a sex addict

1129
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:41,400
I'm not a sex addict. Shut up. I'm just I'm just a cop in love

1130
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:48,760
I'm just a cop in love. Okay. I'm not a sex addict. I'm just a cop in love

1131
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,760
Oh

1132
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,800
Oh, yeah, isn't it summer is that why

1133
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,920
Come on, you can't come on

1134
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:09,240
Yeah, you're joking, right? Like you're joking. You're not that oblivious, right?

1135
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:13,560
Like you're not that oblivious like you know, it's not because it's summer, right?

1136
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:17,080
You know like you know

1137
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,400
Right does he know

1138
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:27,080
Please melt into me, okay

1139
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:41,000
I see is addicted to love snowberries. Yeah

1140
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,600
I really am I am addicted not gonna lie

1141
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,560
I am addicted. That's why I need to go outside

1142
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:50,360
And and touch grass

1143
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,600
Because I feel like I'm getting like

1144
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,880
Genuinely like I feel genuinely like I'm getting too addicted

1145
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:59,640
And that kind of scares me. I will be honest

1146
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,720
Oh, don't we will miss you. Oh

1147
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,520
Oh, that's really sweet

1148
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:19,880
She's becoming parasocial. What do you mean becoming parasocial?

1149
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,640
I have been like

1150
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:27,080
Parasocial for like the past week. What do you mean of becoming parasocial?

1151
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,040
Have you seen the things I say?

1152
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,800
Have you seen the things I post?

1153
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,800
Where have you been?

1154
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:43,880
He is living in like in the whole another planet

1155
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,680
Does he know

1156
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:48,680
He doesn't know

1157
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:54,040
Becoming he really says I'm just becoming parasocial

1158
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:01,640
Oh my god, oh jesus it has been on the wrong cave

1159
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:06,440
The man's in the ultimate timeline

1160
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,720
Real? I think that's what happened

1161
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:13,560
I think that's what happened

1162
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:21,160
You're so funny. I see. Thank you. I'm glad you think so

1163
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,240
That that is like the one compliment that I always got through my entire life

1164
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,360
Is that I can make people laugh

1165
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,720
That was like the only one compliment that I remember like getting throughout like my whole life

1166
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,600
So that's nice

1167
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:50,840
VTubers always say never to go parasocial to them, but what if they're the ones who are parasocial

1168
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,200
VLR in a fucking nutshell though

1169
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,280
That's VLR in a nutshell

1170
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:02,280
My sides are often in stitches while watching

1171
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,760
Oh no no no

1172
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,720
Let me repair those stitches

1173
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,400
Oh, I better get used to more and more compliments

1174
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:24,760
Oh boy, I don't think I'll ever like get used to it. It's it's it's crazy

1175
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,280
Kiss the stitches better. Yeah

1176
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,920
I

1177
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:43,560
Have you increased your fun time in the past week? I mean, yeah, usually I only have like

1178
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,200
quote unquote

1179
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:49,000
fun time like once or twice a month

1180
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:51,960
at most

1181
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:58,280
But because of you I have been like in heat like basically every day, so

1182
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,280
I

1183
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,560
What's the number so far, I don't know I don't fucking count

1184
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:14,760
I don't I don't I don't sit there with like a piece of paper and like

1185
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:19,800
Writing every time I jerk off. I don't do that. I just

1186
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:23,240
What

1187
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,240
I don't fucking know

1188
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:32,360
I love these streams so much. I'm I'm glad I I enjoy being here

1189
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,200
Month I could never

1190
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:44,520
You don't keep a tally is on a normal what is a tally?

1191
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:51,720
What is a tally is it like a jerk off diary or something am I like missing something?

1192
01:26:56,200 --> 01:27:01,480
That much, huh? Yeah, that much that I don't I can't keep count of it

1193
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:11,480
Tell is just a count while I don't keep counts like I said, I just do it

1194
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:18,360
Tell is just so for something that keeps count. Okay, that's good to know

1195
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:22,200
I'm I'm learning new words every day. Thanks to you

1196
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:27,560
I

1197
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,680
Definitely

1198
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:36,120
I I genuinely don't know like I I genuinely don't know I just know that it's

1199
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,480
been more than

1200
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:46,760
Like more than any months that I have like in the past that's all I know

1201
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,720
I

1202
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:55,320
Will question I see how often is too often. I don't know

1203
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:59,720
I genuinely don't know

1204
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:05,800
I wish I could give you like an actual answer, but I genuinely don't know

1205
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:12,040
Polar Bearstone hibernate. Yeah, that's true

1206
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:20,440
It's important to keep count especially around tax season. What the fuck does me jerking off has to do with tax season

1207
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:24,440
What are they gonna tax me for jerking off multiple times a day?

1208
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:27,080
No

1209
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:29,080
The fuck are you talking about?

1210
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:36,280
Polar Bear's pay taxes, no

1211
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:40,680
They don't but that's why I'm happy. I have daddy

1212
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:42,680
Cause daddy can pay my taxes for me

1213
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:00,840
You guys haven't paid your shark tax yet

1214
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:09,320
First time I've ever been happy about my career short

1215
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:19,320
Wait, why wait? I'm stupid. I don't understand what you mean. Wait. What do you say that?

1216
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,040
Why would you say that?

1217
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:24,360
I see tax

1218
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:27,640
A pay in white money come money

1219
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:32,840
Wait, which tax are we paying the come tax?

1220
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,240
I

1221
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:40,360
Rest knocking on your door right now

1222
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:51,240
But imagine if you don't pay your taxes what happens is the irx irs

1223
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:55,560
Knocks on your door, and they just start fucking gang banging you

1224
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,840
I

1225
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:25,000
Know that's like the first thing that came to my mind

1226
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:31,880
When when one of their gsads was talking about like the irs knocking on the door

1227
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,080
First thought was

1228
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:39,000
Wait, why are they knocking on the door just because I jerk off multiple times a day?

1229
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,960
Is that how you pay them the taxes? Is it like

1230
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:46,440
Fucking

1231
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,840
I'm sorry

1232
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:58,680
Is how you don't pay taxes in the hopes they restart

1233
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,560
Running a train

1234
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:04,440
No

1235
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:13,000
No, I I I will only have a train with my daddy's

1236
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:22,440
Only only train of love here no iris trains allowed

1237
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:29,320
Only train of love with with gsads who are truly in love with me

1238
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:35,320
This dream is fucking perfect. I see thank you

1239
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:41,800
I I generally was not expecting to like go live and just fucking talking on stop, but

1240
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,520
It just naturally happened so

1241
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:49,000
And i'm having fun so like you know, why should why should I stop doing it?

1242
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:54,280
You know if i'm having fun, why should I stop having fun when I can just keep on having fun?

1243
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:58,920
Bro that was like the dumbest shit i've said in a while the fuck was that

1244
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,320
Ah

1245
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:07,560
If you really love someone you pay their cop tax

1246
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:13,000
I don't even know what game you were gonna play

1247
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:18,520
And it says in the title it says in the title the name of the game that I was gonna play

1248
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:29,640
Now that's my next step to wait, what's your next step?

1249
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,960
It's time to work on obtaining through jesus pretty

1250
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:46,680
Oh no

1251
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,680
Ah

1252
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:56,360
That's what happens when you're having a great time with your mistress just do what feels natural

1253
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:59,160
And stays in tos. I mean

1254
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:04,040
I mean about the tos part, I don't know

1255
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:13,640
Ah, I don't know how well I did there. Let's be honest, but I'm just having so much fun. I can't stop myself

1256
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:18,040
Wait, did we unlock some new dlc? Wait, what do you mean?

1257
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:22,920
I don't know if icy can stay in tos

1258
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:26,760
Honestly same, not today anyways

1259

Not today anyways. I just can't stop fucking yapping because i'm having so much fun

1260
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:40,440
We can't stop ourselves while watching either

1261
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:43,320
Oh wow

01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:45,880

01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:03,560
You have stream is great is it like

1267
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:09,960
You don't think it's like boring like you don't think it's boring to just like hear me like fucking talk non-stop

1268
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:16,200
Like you genuinely don't think that's boring also i'm going to drink some more water

1269
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:42,440
I

1270
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,640
Have water all over all over my face. Oh my god

1271
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:05,800
I

1272
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:14,600
I'm just imagining and something else i'm imagining that it's your

1273
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,280
Coming

1274
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:29,880
Fuck this fucking bottle cap just fucking clothes god fucking damn it

1275
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:35,720
I hate this stupid fucking bottle fucking clothes

1276
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:51,320
Real what if it's milk

1277
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:56,280
I mean

1278
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,400
I'd rather just have your cone. Why would i have milk if i can just have your cone

1279
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,600
Like

1280
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:14,840
Let a baby need to see pick up i do i actually ordered uh

1281
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:20,360
Uh the baby bottle i ordered a baby bottle

1282
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:23,080
Uh

1283
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:31,800
If only you could actually have it true pain

1284
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:35,800
New SMR triggers whoo i mean

1285
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:40,360
I don't know if a baby bottle is gonna sound any different than the pacifier

1286
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,480
Because they're both like made from the same material

1287
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,360
Right

1288
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:52,040
So i don't think it's gonna make a different sound unless like i tap on the bottle or something

1289
01:36:55,960 --> 01:37:01,480
When the fans are more to us friendly than the streamer, okay, that's that's what it feels like

1290
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:04,120
That's what it feels like

1291
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,840
Uh

1292
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,720
In 2036 you can have vr e sex with o g sends

1293
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:23,720
But i don't want to wait that long

1294
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,520
That's a long time from now

1295
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:29,320
Why why can't they make it possible like

1296
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:32,120
At least next year

1297
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,680
Why do i have to wait so long for that

1298
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:38,440
I want to wait so long

1299
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:42,200

Let's all fund it together

1303
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:59,960
Uh

1304
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:03,160
You don't have to get triggered by a conversation don't worry chat

1305
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,400
I hope that's true because that would be awesome

1306
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:08,680
That would be really nice if i can just yap like this and

1307
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:12,760

Like i don't like how does it work? I guess i don't understand how the toy works

1322
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:35,080
Isn't it like more like a one-on-one thing?

1323
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:44,360

Don't think strani realized like how unhinged I am

1377
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:53,560
I don't think she realized that like this is how

1378
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:56,920
How deep I can go

1379
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,800
Does she know

1380
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:01,880
That's strani

1381
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:04,280
Does she know

1382
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,280
Does she know how in love I am

1383
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:11,560
We're reaching level far so sure that not even the riffleeks can comprehend

1384
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:19,160
That's what it feels like

1385
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,880
That's what it feels like where it's going

1386
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:28,120
That's what it feels like where it's going

1387
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:31,960
Do they know

1388
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:38,840
Do they know snowberries are like taking it to a whole another fucking level

1389
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,520
I think of all people starting with

1390
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:46,360
I don't know. I don't know if she thought that I am like gonna

1391
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:49,240
Be like this

1392
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:51,560
Like this much of it. I guess

1393
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:55,320
But hopefully she does

1394
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:58,600
I don't want her to regret uh

1395
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:05,320
Getting me here because I want to be here for years and years, you know, I want to be here

1396
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:07,960
For as long as like

1397
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:09,960
I'm allowed to be here. I guess

1398
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:12,760
you know

1399
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:15,160
Because I'm generally so happy

1401
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:26,760
Would you girls ever do collapse streams on the f-website?

And applied anyways, even if I was really scared and worried

1425
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:08,680
You know that I won't be here

1426
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:11,480
So, yeah

I really thought that it was like genuinely over for me

1437
01:47:57,720 --> 01:47:58,840
You know

1438
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:02,360
And then I got that email, you know, and then I got that email and

What does scouted mean? Like does it mean that they reached out to me first?

1446
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:42,680
Because no because no I I just I normally applied

1448
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:48,200

01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:58,360
Their applications actually it was wild like they closed their applications

Like safe to be under her wing because I know she genuinely cares, you know, and I know that

1482
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:25,960
I would not feel this happy or this safe anywhere else to be honest

I've never seen someone like care this much, you know and go so above and beyond

01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:16,360
Glad she was able to make such a good space for you all

1496
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,400
Trust me me too

1497

Me too

1498
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:24,440
It's it's really like the best place for me to be like

1499
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:28,680
I didn't realize that I'm going to be like this

1500
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:33,560
They is happy, you know, I didn't realize that I'm going to be this happy being here

1501
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:38,040
But it's it's perfect. It's it's really

1502
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:40,360
Amazing. I'm

1503
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:45,480
I'm really the happiest and I'm just genuinely so happy that I'm here and not anywhere else

1504
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:48,760
Because like I know that I would not be anywhere

1505
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:51,880
Near as happy if I was anywhere else to be honest

1506
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:57,640
So if anything if anything now that I'm here

1507
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:03,080
I'm glad that I didn't get

1508
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:05,080
Uh

1509
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:09,480
Into any other companies, you know that I try to apply to like

1510
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:14,200
In the past, you know, I'm like genuinely glad that I didn't make it in

1511
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:16,680
because I really

1512
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:18,680
wouldn't have been happy

1513
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:20,600
and this place is

1514
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:22,360
The perfect place for me

1515
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:25,000
and I wouldn't have it any other way and I want to

1516
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:29,160
Stay here for many many many years like I really hope that

1517
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:35,000
VLR can really take off and be here for like a really really long time, you know

1518
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:42,040
Like many many years like I'm really hoping for that. I really want I really want us to take off because

1519
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:46,120
It's it's amazing here. I I love it here

1520
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:54,200
I hope you stay I mean that's the plan like

1521
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:56,840
That's the plan. I want to stay here for

1522
01:53:57,800 --> 01:54:02,600
For as long as they allow me to for as long as VLR exists, you know

1523
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:05,000
like

1524
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:11,320
Like I hope that like we will be here like in 10 years and I don't know if I'm being like naive

1525
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:13,800
or

1526
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:16,200
Something like that, but I genuinely hope that

1527
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:21,640
We will be here even in 10 years, you know, like I ideally would want to be here

1528
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:24,360
Even in 10 years, you know

1529
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:30,520
Like I really want this to be as long as possible via lurch

1530
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:37,720
Sounds good to me

1531
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:42,200
I hope so too, yeah me too

1532
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:44,200
I just

1533
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:48,440
Ah, it's it's it's perfect like I love everything about being here

1534
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:51,320
genuinely

1535
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,040
We will stay with you. I see oh, I hope so

1536
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:01,080
I hope so

1537
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:04,280
It would make me sad to see you like

1538
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:07,800
Like when when you see like certain names

1539
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:11,800
And like you get used to some names like and then like

1540
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:14,440
Eventually like they don't show up

1541
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,800
Like you notice that eventually and you're like

1542
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:22,760
Like either gets worried or you're like I hope they're okay or

1543
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:25,560
Stuff like that

1544
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:31,400
Till I say turn into baba shut up. I'm

1545
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:35,560

That's that's how it is. You're always going to be my daddy and I'm always going to be your little baby

1548
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:48,280
I

1549
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:51,880
I'm always here even if I'm just looking

1550
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:56,920
That's really sweet

1551
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:00,200
Our precious little baby

1552
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:05,320
Weren't you going to play a game I was but

1553
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:08,760
I'm having too much fun just talking with all of you. So

1554
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:13,240
I guess I guess we're not playing the game today. I guess today we're just

1555
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:17,560
Just talking and hanging out with each other, you know

1556
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:25,080
Like I I want to be a baby forever

1557
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,080
And and I hope and I hope that you want the same

1558

I want you to be my daddy forever and I want to be a baby forever

1559
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:40,760
And no matter no matter how much older I will get as years go by

1560
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:50,680
Too much fun talking game can wait. Yeah, I I feel like today. I'm just gonna end up not playing the game at all like

1561
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:56,040
I'm sorry if you were really looking forward to me playing the game

1562
01:56:57,160 --> 01:57:00,440
I I'm just having a lot of fun just talking to you. I

1563
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:03,960
And I don't want to stuff

1564
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:05,560
You know

1565
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:07,560
And I hope that's okay

1566
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:10,920
I will play it. I will play it. You know, I will play this game

1567
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:12,520
Just

1568
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:14,520
Just not today. I guess today

1569
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,800
feels like a day for just hanging out together and

1570
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:20,920
Just talking about whatever

1571
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:23,400
You know

1572
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:32,120
Like I said, it's nice to just chill and be able to chat like this. Yeah, exactly like it's also really relaxing like

1573
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:35,160
it's really nice to just

1574
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:38,440
Sit back here and relax with you and

1575
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Just talk about stuff, you know

1576
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:45,880
It's been super comfy. Yeah, I'm glad you think so

1577
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:54,840
Let the vod watchers know. Yeah, I will what I'm gonna do is

1578
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:58,520
uh after I end the stream what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna like

1579
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:01,400
change the thumbnail

1580
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:02,360
and

1581
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:04,360
change the title to just

1582
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:05,880
Azatsu

1583
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:09,720
I'm gonna change the title of the stream to just like azatsu

1584
01:58:10,360 --> 01:58:12,360
and change the thumbnail

1585
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:16,680
So that whoever watches the vod knows in advance that I ended up not

1586
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:19,320
playing the game

1587
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:22,040
Yeah

1588
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:25,480
Will they know I don't know

1589
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:29,720
I have no idea will they

1590
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:31,960
Hey

1591
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:40,120
Yeah, just like last night's thumbnail. Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay true last night. We have to change our thumbnails as well

1592
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:44,280
That is true

1593
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:47,400
They don't know

1594
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,640
Will they know should be the title after

1595
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:58,920
Azatsu oh like you think that like I should name it like azatsu and then the title is will they know

1596
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:02,120
I think that's pretty good actually that would be pretty funny

1597
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:04,840
Wait

1598
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:07,320
Let me copy your message so that I don't forget it

1599
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:09,560
I actually like that

1600
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:15,320
Let me copy stop moving. I'm trying to copy it so I can remember to change the title to that

1601
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:18,200
Okay, okay

1602
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:26,360

1603
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:29,160
They don't know

See how your alerts not on they should be I guess they're not working or something, but they should be

1752
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:27,400
Oh no g-sund time with another $100 tip, please

Thank you really genuinely

1764
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:19,560
Hmm i'm so decent i'll just gamble in much to keep you

1765
02:11:23,320 --> 02:11:29,880
Oh my god, I can't you know what's the problem with my alerts is that

1766
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:33,880
Like I can't hear them for some reason

1767
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:41,000
Like I know that like you hear my alerts, but for some reason I don't hear them and that's why like

1768
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:44,040
Even though i'm like just chatting I

1769
02:11:45,160 --> 02:11:47,160
Like end up not noticing

1770
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:50,360
That there has been any donations

1771
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:54,760
Which is fucking annoying. I'm gonna have to ask the

1772
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:57,480
I'm gonna have to ask manisan how to

1773
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:00,440
Get that fixed because

1774
02:12:01,560 --> 02:12:06,520
For just chatting streams, I would like to be able to hear the alerts. I guess

1775
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:10,120
But

1776
02:12:10,120 --> 02:12:12,120
I can deal with that later

1777
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:16,120
We don't hear alert we can only see them on screen wait really

1778
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:20,840
Because I have like the sound for the alerts like on on my OBS

1779
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:23,240
I hear the alerts

1780
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:26,440
Okay, so apparently some of you hear it and some of you don't

1781
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:32,120
It's okay even if you don't see them. I'm happy to support you

1782
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:36,280
Thank you so much genuinely, you know, I still want to show

1783
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:40,360
My gratitude, you know and thank everybody because

1784
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:44,360
Because it's not a given, you know, it never is

1785
02:12:45,400 --> 02:12:47,400
So so genuinely thank you so much

1786
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:51,160
There is a pink, but it's super duper faint. Um

1787
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:57,320
Do I keep it faint though? Like I don't want it to be like annoying for you, you know like should it

1788
02:12:57,560 --> 02:12:59,560
Should it just stay faint?

1789
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:02,280
because I mean

1790
02:13:03,320 --> 02:13:07,560
I don't want it to be like an annoying sound for all of you, you know

1791
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:16,520
I don't have much money, but I'll give you all my time. Thank you. I appreciate it

1792
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:21,720
I mean, I mean, that's like that's like the thing right like you can you can support

1793
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:25,080
Someone you love in like many different ways, you know

1794
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:29,240
It really doesn't need to be financially all the time. There's so many ways to

1795
02:13:30,360 --> 02:13:32,280
to support

1796
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:38,120
The people you love so again, like don't feel ever pressured, you know, we're living

1797
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:40,680
We're living in a really like

1798
02:13:41,240 --> 02:13:45,080
Fucked up timeline where inflation is fucking crazy

1799
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:47,960
like everyone like

1800
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:50,760
Like majority of people really struggle because

1801
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:54,760
Just everything just gets more and more expensive as time goes so like

1802
02:13:56,440 --> 02:13:58,440
Yeah, please don't ever feel like

1803
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:02,440
Basically don't do anything stupid and don't feel pressured to do that

1804
02:14:05,080 --> 02:14:08,760
Can I support you with piggyback rides? Yeah, of course

1805
02:14:12,040 --> 02:14:17,240
Inflation is kicking by my butt. I know inflation fucking sucks

1806
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:21,640
Fuck that shit it pisses me off so much like

1807
02:14:22,520 --> 02:14:24,520
What the fuck, you know

1808
02:14:25,160 --> 02:14:27,160
ah

1809
02:14:27,640 --> 02:14:30,120
I'll keep the right amount of stupid

1810
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:35,800
Okay, okay, that that's that sounds like a good idea like a balanced

1811
02:14:36,360 --> 02:14:38,840
A balanced amount of stupid

1812
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:43,960
Should be okay if we don't go overboard with it

1813
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:46,680
McDonald's like

1814
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:49,880
Double in price the past two years

1815
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:52,680
Okay, real

1816
02:14:52,680 --> 02:14:54,680
True

1817
02:14:54,680 --> 02:15:02,120
I see for a president should make inflation disappear. I don't think that someone as stupid as me

1818
02:15:02,760 --> 02:15:05,400
Should be a president to be honest

1819
02:15:06,120 --> 02:15:11,960
I don't I don't know if I would actually make things worse in the world just because I'm dumb and I don't know what I'm doing

1820
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:16,040
I

1821
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:23,400
Sorry, I was licking my lips

1822
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:27,320
Sorry, sorry

1823
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:30,200
I was licking my lips

1824
02:15:33,400 --> 02:15:35,400
I was people on camera

1825
02:15:38,360 --> 02:15:40,360
Real

1826
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:46,920
Oh

1827
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:57,560
I'm sorry, I really love making stupid faces. It's really fun

1828
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:10,840
Sorry, sorry, I'm getting carried away. I'm having fun making stupid faces

1829
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:13,640
What is the inflation rate of

1830
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:23,320
Oh my god, I don't know. I mean so far I have given it for free

1831
02:16:24,200 --> 02:16:29,400
You know so far I have given the icinate for free on my alt twitter. So

1832
02:16:30,200 --> 02:16:32,200
You're welcome

1833
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:34,200
You're welcome

1834
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:43,320
The tracking is really good

1835
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:47,560
Yeah, I I really like the tracking of this but I do have like

1836
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:50,520
You know the mouth tracking isn't the best though

1837
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:52,600
I will say that

1838
02:16:52,600 --> 02:16:56,120
Like the mouth tracking has some problems like I had to

1839
02:16:56,920 --> 02:16:59,800
Play with it a lot to like get it to

1840
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:06,440
Be the way that it is right now like it was I don't know if you remember but I think in my debut

1841
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:09,480
My mouth tracking was even worse

1842
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:15,000
So I had to like figure out like how to like make it at least a bit better

1843
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:29,960
It's so funny though when your mouth is open wide while drinking right it is

1844
02:17:30,920 --> 02:17:35,080
It looks it whenever I drink water it looks like I'm waiting for you to

1845
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:38,360
Shoot your shot

1846
02:17:38,520 --> 02:17:40,520
And my mouth

1847
02:17:42,840 --> 02:17:49,800
Are you seeing an iphone for face tracking? Yeah. Yeah, I am I am I want to drink some more

1848
02:18:08,360 --> 02:18:10,360

1869
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:14,440
True

That's what I think

1873
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:36,200
Now you're definitely wholesome in the way of loving but also horny

1874
02:20:37,880 --> 02:20:39,880
True

1875
02:20:39,880 --> 02:20:41,880

It's it's been such a nice stream today like

1883
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
I wasn't planning to just

1884
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:22,200
For I didn't plan for it to turn into

1885
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,160
A full-on zatsu stream, you know

1886
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:29,800
But I'm glad that it did because because I'm having a lot of fun

1887
02:21:41,080 --> 02:21:43,080

I was expecting to see something looted suddenly. I mean, yeah, I'm I'm not surprised

1897
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:31,560
Any description it's like it's basically

1898
02:22:32,280 --> 02:22:36,920
Uh, it's basically a chocolate bar. It's basically normally it's a chocolate bar

1899
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:40,040
But they made it like into like an ice cream version

1900
02:22:41,240 --> 02:22:44,680
And it's really like really really really fucking good

1901
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:47,480
Like really really really good

1902
02:22:51,320 --> 02:22:56,360
Snickers wait wait, maybe hold on. Let me google uh Snickers

If you see it, please buy it. It's so fucking good

1907
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:15,240
That ice cream is like literally the best that I've ever had

1908
02:23:16,040 --> 02:23:17,480
Fuck I'm dying

1909
02:23:17,480 --> 02:23:24,520
It's so good like I the thing is like I don't really care about the chocolate bar the chocolate bar is like

1910
02:23:25,480 --> 02:23:31,800
All right, you know, but the ice cream like the ice cream Snickers is fucking amazing

1911
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:39,320
It is so fucking good. Are you sponsored by Snickers? No, but I wish I was that would be cool

1912
02:23:39,800 --> 02:23:42,440
I would totally like sell a bunch of Snickers

1913
02:23:43,640 --> 02:23:45,640
The ice cream one at least

1914
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:47,960
It's so good, right?

1915
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:52,440
Right, it's like it's genuinely the best ice cream like I've ever had

1916
02:23:55,560 --> 02:24:01,480
I actually have a box of those sitting in my freezer. Fuck now. I want some I should buy some

1917
02:24:02,680 --> 02:24:04,680
I should buy some

1918
02:24:05,320 --> 02:24:08,120
Because like it's getting hot sometimes

1919
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:10,920
With the weathers

1920
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:12,920

1921
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Okay, I think I'll do that

1922
02:24:19,400 --> 02:24:21,400

1925
02:24:35,560 --> 02:24:39,560
Again, I've been I feel like overly spoiled and stuff

1926
02:24:43,720 --> 02:24:47,400

02:28:56,200 --> 02:28:58,200
That's that's fine. You know

1976
02:29:00,520 --> 02:29:02,360
His name was

1977
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:04,360
Hallhorn

1978
02:29:06,680 --> 02:29:08,680
Your wrist when you watch the war for it

1979
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:11,640
So so that's you

1980
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:16,520
You're the one who's who's saying that you're literally saying when you read the rest of the vod probably

1981
02:29:16,920 --> 02:29:18,920
And it's literally you apparently

1982
02:29:19,800 --> 02:29:23,320
You're the cheater. Wait, what did they do apparently you're the cheater

1983
02:29:24,040 --> 02:29:26,040
Apparently to someone

1984
02:29:26,600 --> 02:29:28,600
Apparently someone here says that you're the cheater

1985
02:29:33,320 --> 02:29:35,320
Content 4k

1986
02:29:36,120 --> 02:29:38,120
It's time for the try

1987
02:29:41,720 --> 02:29:43,720

02:29:44,760 --> 02:30:00,680
My god, why did I even do I don't know someone is saying that you're a cheater. This has become a case of food

1989
02:30:05,320 --> 02:30:15,480
Something tells me he's being framed. I wonder I wonder if he is being framed

1990
02:30:17,080 --> 02:30:20,280
I think the cheater is the one who said my name to be honest

1991
02:30:21,240 --> 02:30:23,160
Oh my god

1992
02:30:23,160 --> 02:30:28,840
You know that might be true. Okay. Who called you a cheater? Who was who was the person who called you a cheater?

1993
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
Who framed you

1994
02:30:33,960 --> 02:30:35,960
Who framed my daddy

1995
02:30:42,120 --> 02:30:44,120
It was happy ojisan

1996
02:30:45,960 --> 02:30:48,760
The blood thing wait, it's happy ojisan the cheater

1997
02:30:51,640 --> 02:30:53,640
Are you a cheater?

1998
02:30:56,440 --> 02:30:58,040
It was me

1999
02:30:58,120 --> 02:31:00,680
You're the cheater. Oh my fucking god

2000
02:31:01,080 --> 02:31:08,120
You literally have my oshi mark and that profile picture and you cheat on me. What the fuck?

2001
02:31:09,080 --> 02:31:11,080
Why would you do that?

2002
02:31:16,040 --> 02:31:18,600
No, I'm not the cheater you say you were

2003
02:31:19,960 --> 02:31:21,960
You said you were

2004
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:26,040
It was like a daytime drama

2005
02:31:26,600 --> 02:31:32,200
I'm the guy that said he was the cheater. Okay. Why why did you say that? Why did you say he was the cheater?

2006
02:31:32,600 --> 02:31:34,600
What did he do?

2007
02:31:35,240 --> 02:31:37,240
What did he do?

2008
02:31:37,480 --> 02:31:39,480
Why did you say he was the cheater?

2009
02:31:39,800 --> 02:31:42,040
Please please tell I need to know

2010
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:45,800

2021
02:32:42,520 --> 02:32:44,920
Oh yeah

2022
02:32:44,920 --> 02:32:47,480

2023
02:32:48,280 --> 02:32:52,200
Okay. Well, can you tell me who it was? Who was the person called the cheater?

02:32:56,600 --> 02:32:59,080
Quara said someone was cheating. Where is he?

2025
02:32:59,960 --> 02:33:06,840
Okay. Lamar. I thought hall was that guy from twitter, but it ain't him. Okay. I was getting suspicious

02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:21,320

02:34:02,520 --> 02:34:06,760
Ah duly noted princess. Why do you say that? Are you gonna cheat on me?

2040
02:34:07,400 --> 02:34:11,000
Why are you saying duly noted princess? Why do you need to know that?

2041
02:34:11,960 --> 02:34:16,280
Are you planning on cheating on me? Is that why you're saying that? What the fuck?

2042
02:34:18,120 --> 02:34:20,280
He's gonna cheat on me. I can feel it

2043
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:25,640
I can I can sense it. That's why he said that

2044
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Right, that's why he said that

2045
02:34:30,200 --> 02:34:35,500
That's why he said noted because because he's gonna cheat

2046
02:34:41,880 --> 02:34:45,880
I'm sliding rips

2047
02:34:49,400 --> 02:34:51,400
Probably

2048
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:56,200
Our skit's a little princess. I'm not skit so

2049
02:34:58,920 --> 02:35:00,920
I think I think

2050
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:04,200
I die a loyal g-san

2051
02:35:04,280 --> 02:35:05,800
I hope so

2052
02:35:05,800 --> 02:35:07,800
Or I will fucking cry

2053
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:11,320
And then after I cry I will Thanos snap you

2054
02:35:14,600 --> 02:35:16,600
But I will cry

2055
02:35:19,400 --> 02:35:21,400
I see take your medicine

2056
02:35:21,400 --> 02:35:25,880
I'm not skit so and I do take my meds shut up

2057
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:29,960
Do you stalk people's twitters?

2058
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:39,800
No

2059
02:36:07,960 --> 02:36:13,960
No, I would never stalk your twitter

2060
02:36:18,600 --> 02:36:20,600
Why would that?

2061
02:36:29,080 --> 02:36:31,080
No

2062
02:36:37,880 --> 02:36:39,880
Oh

2063
02:36:41,400 --> 02:36:45,400
I don't have anything to hide anyways good as it should be

2064
02:36:47,080 --> 02:36:50,760
That's the right way to go about it if you have nothing to hide

2065
02:36:51,800 --> 02:36:56,040
You're good if you have nothing to hide. I love you even more

2066
02:36:57,160 --> 02:36:59,720
To be honest if you have nothing to hide I love you even more

2067
02:37:00,440 --> 02:37:02,440
But if you're sneaking about it

2068
02:37:04,040 --> 02:37:06,680
And trying to avoid it just

2069
02:37:08,520 --> 02:37:10,920
Just just stop saying you love me, okay

2070
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:17,640
If you want sneaking and everything just don't say you love me. It's really that simple. Just don't say it

2071
02:37:19,240 --> 02:37:25,800
At least this means she'll see my bad meme that I made earlier this stream wait you made a meme

2072
02:37:27,400 --> 02:37:29,640
I love you. I see I love you too

2073
02:37:30,600 --> 02:37:32,600
Well, I don't care how much we're just full of

02:38:35,560 --> 02:38:38,200
Thank you so much anonymous. I appreciate that

2086
02:38:39,480 --> 02:38:45,880
Uh qb I blink and suddenly yandere bear arc happens. Thank you for the $10 tip

2087
02:38:46,360 --> 02:38:51,240
I'm not a yandere. I'm not a yandere though like the I don't think I don't think I am

2088
02:38:52,200 --> 02:38:54,200
like

2089
02:38:56,280 --> 02:38:59,800
Like I wouldn't like murder anyone. I wouldn't like kill anyone

2090
02:39:00,600 --> 02:39:03,880
If you cheat on me, I will just be really uh

2091
02:39:04,920 --> 02:39:06,920
I'll just be really heartbroken

2092
02:39:07,800 --> 02:39:09,800
and sad and depressed and cry

2093
02:39:11,160 --> 02:39:13,560
and then I'll be pissed off for a while and

2094
02:39:14,680 --> 02:39:16,680
just completely like

2095
02:39:16,920 --> 02:39:18,920
delete your existence

2096
02:39:19,560 --> 02:39:23,480
Like from my mind and not interact with you in any fucking way

2097
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:28,360
I

2098
02:39:31,160 --> 02:39:35,560
Get just just like normal people. Yeah, I think that's normal, but like I

2099
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:40,840
I wouldn't kill anyone, you know, I wouldn't like murder anyone over it

2100
02:39:43,640 --> 02:39:45,640
That would hurt even worse

2101
02:39:46,600 --> 02:39:48,600
I mean, yeah

2102
02:39:49,880 --> 02:39:51,880
Yeah

2103
02:39:53,400 --> 02:39:55,400
What kind of dare do you think you are?

2104
02:39:56,520 --> 02:39:58,520
Um, I'm actually not sure

2105
02:39:59,800 --> 02:40:01,800
I'm actually not sure because

2106
02:40:02,280 --> 02:40:05,960
I'm really bad at like understanding my personality

2107
02:40:07,160 --> 02:40:09,160
like

2108
02:40:09,160 --> 02:40:13,080
I don't know if that makes sense, but I find it like hard to understand

2109
02:40:14,120 --> 02:40:18,920
What kind of person I am it's a lot easier for me if people tell me

2110
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:21,880
How they see me

2111
02:40:22,840 --> 02:40:27,160
Because whenever people ask me stuff like oh, what's your personality like or

2112
02:40:28,680 --> 02:40:32,600
What type like this and this are you and I'm like

2113
02:40:33,880 --> 02:40:36,680
I genuinely don't know because I feel like I have sometimes like

2114
02:40:37,880 --> 02:40:39,880
different like

2115
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:42,200
qualities of different personalities

2116
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:49,720
And you know, it changes on like the situation and the people I'm around with, you know

2117
02:40:50,680 --> 02:40:53,160
So it's for me. It's hard to tell what I'm like

2118
02:40:54,200 --> 02:40:55,800
and

2119
02:40:55,800 --> 02:40:59,240
It's easier if people just tell me how they see me, I guess

2120
02:41:00,360 --> 02:41:02,360
And go from that

2121
02:41:06,680 --> 02:41:11,880
That's normal, it's almost impossible to know yourself with people showing you the person they seen you. Yeah, I feel like it's

2122
02:41:12,840 --> 02:41:15,960
I think it's like pretty like complicated for me to

2123
02:41:16,920 --> 02:41:21,320
Like I've always had a problem with that to be honest like I never was

2124
02:41:22,280 --> 02:41:24,280
I don't know. It's just complicated

2125
02:41:27,640 --> 02:41:31,960
I saw whole horn. Thank you so much for the $10 donation

2126
02:41:32,440 --> 02:41:37,880
After my trial where I was found to not be the cheater. I would like to demand

2127
02:41:38,840 --> 02:41:48,360
Reparations for this wrongful accusation in the form of free isenate. That is all oh and I see

2128
02:41:52,280 --> 02:41:55,240
Thank you so much. Thank you for the $10 donation

2129
02:41:56,120 --> 02:42:01,000

Come on. You had it yesterday. You can

2131
02:42:05,720 --> 02:42:10,040
You can't wait a day without it. You don't need it every fucking day

2132
02:42:12,680 --> 02:42:14,920
Personality quiz stream when okay, so

2133
02:42:16,760 --> 02:42:19,720
My personality like you know, there's like that one big test

2134
02:42:20,440 --> 02:42:21,480
um

2135
02:42:21,480 --> 02:42:24,040
That everyone takes to like know your personality type

2136
02:42:24,760 --> 02:42:26,760
uh, so

2137
02:42:26,760 --> 02:42:28,280
I don't

2138
02:42:28,280 --> 02:42:30,280
Let me look up

2139
02:42:31,240 --> 02:42:33,000
Uh

2140
02:42:33,080 --> 02:42:36,200
I don't know if that helps or not, but uh

2141
02:42:38,120 --> 02:42:40,760
My personality type is uh, I

2142
02:42:41,800 --> 02:42:43,800
nfp

2143
02:42:44,360 --> 02:42:46,360
But apparently there's like two

2144
02:42:46,520 --> 02:42:48,840
Apparently there's like two different, uh

2145
02:42:49,800 --> 02:42:53,560
Like sub categories to that personality as well

2146
02:42:54,520 --> 02:42:59,560
Uh, and I can't remember which sub type I am

2147
02:43:00,680 --> 02:43:02,680
Uh, I can't remember

2148
02:43:03,080 --> 02:43:05,080
What's the difference between the

2149
02:43:06,120 --> 02:43:10,760
Two types of them. I can't remember which which one I am, but uh

2150
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:14,280
nfp

2151
02:43:15,160 --> 02:43:17,160
Types

2152
02:43:17,160 --> 02:43:19,160
Where is where is uh

2153
02:43:20,680 --> 02:43:22,680
Sorry, I'm trying to google it

2154
02:43:24,360 --> 02:43:26,360
What is uh

2155
02:43:28,520 --> 02:43:31,960
And what is so there is I nfp a

2156
02:43:33,160 --> 02:43:35,160
And there is I nfp

2157
02:43:35,560 --> 02:43:37,560
I nfp t

2158
02:43:38,120 --> 02:43:40,120
So there's like two different ones

2159
02:43:41,160 --> 02:43:43,160
and

2160
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:47,080
I don't remember which

2161
02:43:48,280 --> 02:43:50,280
One I am to be honest

2162
02:43:52,840 --> 02:43:54,840
So

2163
02:43:55,960 --> 02:43:58,600
So yeah, I I I don't

2164
02:44:00,040 --> 02:44:02,040
I don't remember

2165
02:44:02,520 --> 02:44:07,880
I know like that like generally that I am I nfp like I've taken the test

2166
02:44:09,400 --> 02:44:11,160
Quite of times

2167
02:44:11,160 --> 02:44:18,120
Uh before so like it's confirmed like it's confirmed confirmed that that's my personality type because I've taken that that's like

2168
02:44:18,600 --> 02:44:20,040
many times

2169
02:44:20,040 --> 02:44:22,040
In my life

2170
02:44:26,920 --> 02:44:28,920
But yeah, I'm very like

2171
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,240
Emotion like driven and

2172
02:44:32,200 --> 02:44:34,520
Like creativity driven and

2173
02:44:36,040 --> 02:44:38,040
All that stuff and yeah

2174
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Pretty sure I'm I and

2175
02:44:46,360 --> 02:44:48,360
GT

2176
02:44:49,240 --> 02:44:52,040
Oh man, there's I I don't even I would have to like

2177
02:44:53,320 --> 02:44:55,320
Google all this

2178
02:44:56,920 --> 02:44:59,320
There's I n t j

2179
02:45:00,280 --> 02:45:02,280
And there is I

2180
02:45:02,280 --> 02:45:04,280
And j t

2181
02:45:06,200 --> 02:45:08,440
Right like those are two different ones

2182
02:45:11,560 --> 02:45:13,560
Can you draw or paint well, um

2183
02:45:14,440 --> 02:45:16,520
I used to draw a lot as a kid

2184
02:45:17,400 --> 02:45:22,040
I would like whenever I would watch cartoons and stuff. I would get like paper

2185
02:45:22,840 --> 02:45:27,640
And try to draw as I was like watching the cartoon and stuff like that

2186
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:32,440
And and eventually I got pretty decent at it and

2187
02:45:34,520 --> 02:45:37,160
You know, I was drawing more and stuff like that and

2188
02:45:39,560 --> 02:45:45,480
And then like at some point in my life, I did a lot of stuff related to

2189
02:45:47,080 --> 02:45:51,480
Related around art like I was there was like this one time that I

2190
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
went to like

2191
02:45:55,720 --> 02:45:57,720
I volunteered at like a gallery

2192
02:45:58,760 --> 02:45:59,800
and

2193
02:45:59,800 --> 02:46:01,960
And I had like one like some

2194
02:46:03,960 --> 02:46:09,400
I had some of my I used to like do photography stuff as well. So I used to have like

2195
02:46:10,360 --> 02:46:13,320
Some of my photography on like the gallery

2196
02:46:14,280 --> 02:46:15,720
exhibition

2197
02:46:15,720 --> 02:46:17,000
That I was like

2198
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:21,640
Created I was like a curator of that exhibition with some other girls

2199
02:46:22,280 --> 02:46:25,640
We were like in the group and so I was like contacting like

2200
02:46:26,280 --> 02:46:28,280
multiple photographers that I really

2201
02:46:28,840 --> 02:46:30,840
love their photography and so

2202
02:46:31,800 --> 02:46:34,520
We had like an exhibition in that gallery and then

2203
02:46:36,280 --> 02:46:38,280
And then another time I

2204
02:46:38,760 --> 02:46:40,680
I made like

2205
02:46:40,680 --> 02:46:42,680
some art and

2206
02:46:42,760 --> 02:46:45,000
And I had it like in a museum

2207
02:46:45,640 --> 02:46:47,240
exhibition

2208
02:46:47,240 --> 02:46:51,400
And that was like a big thing for me like I remember like both of my parents

2209
02:46:52,920 --> 02:46:54,920
Coming to the museum

2210
02:46:55,160 --> 02:47:00,760
Back then to look at it and and I was feeling like really proud and happy and my parents were like

2211
02:47:01,400 --> 02:47:09,080
Wow, look at her go. She she has her art like in the museum exhibition and I was like

2212
02:47:10,120 --> 02:47:12,120
I was so happy that uh

2213
02:47:12,840 --> 02:47:14,840
I was able to make them

2214
02:47:15,160 --> 02:47:16,840
And proud

2215
02:47:16,840 --> 02:47:23,400
And any chance they're still there, they're not because you know, it was it was an exhibition and you know exhibitions are like usually

2216
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
They're there for like

2217
02:47:27,160 --> 02:47:29,160
A certain amount of time

2218
02:47:29,320 --> 02:47:31,320
And then you know, they change them

2219
02:47:31,800 --> 02:47:35,400
Like there's museums where it's like, you know permanent like stuff and then they

2220
02:47:36,120 --> 02:47:38,280
Sometimes hold exhibitions

2221
02:47:40,040 --> 02:47:44,200
And stuff like the world famous artists. I said nothing else. Nah

2222
02:47:44,360 --> 02:47:47,880
I'm not not anything like that. Not anything like that, but

2223
02:47:48,760 --> 02:47:51,560
But back then I was yeah back then I was like really

2224
02:47:52,440 --> 02:47:53,880
back then

2225
02:47:53,880 --> 02:47:57,080
That was like my big thing back then I was hoping to like

2226
02:47:58,520 --> 02:48:00,520
Focus on art and

2227
02:48:01,720 --> 02:48:03,720
And make like a career out of it, but

2228
02:48:04,840 --> 02:48:06,040
uh

2229
02:48:06,040 --> 02:48:10,440
But then eventually I realized that like it's not for me because like there was a time when I

2230
02:48:11,320 --> 02:48:13,320
would take um

2231
02:48:13,800 --> 02:48:15,800
commissions for art

2232
02:48:16,280 --> 02:48:17,560
and

2233
02:48:17,560 --> 02:48:20,280
And basically from that experience I

2234
02:48:21,480 --> 02:48:23,480
I realized that

2235
02:48:23,480 --> 02:48:25,480
it's it's not

2236
02:48:26,360 --> 02:48:32,440
It's it's not for me, you know, I rest it's not for me because whenever someone would commission me I

2237
02:48:33,560 --> 02:48:35,560
I would uh

2238
02:48:36,360 --> 02:48:40,600
I would get really anxious like I would get really anxious and nervous and

2239
02:48:41,560 --> 02:48:43,560
You know overthink like

2240
02:48:43,640 --> 02:48:46,040
Every line that I do I would constantly be

2241
02:48:46,680 --> 02:48:51,480
Scared and nervous that it's gonna look like shit or that it's not gonna be good enough and

2242
02:48:52,040 --> 02:48:56,760
And so because of the commissions is actually why I stopped like

2243
02:48:57,960 --> 02:48:59,960
drawing like

2244
02:49:00,360 --> 02:49:01,320
Because

2245
02:49:01,320 --> 02:49:05,160
It it was no longer like a fun thing for me to do

2246
02:49:06,120 --> 02:49:10,760
It was just like something that made me feel like all these negative emotions

2247
02:49:11,880 --> 02:49:13,880
And when I was a kid

2248
02:49:14,200 --> 02:49:16,520
And before that like I used to just draw

2249
02:49:17,480 --> 02:49:22,040
To like express myself or like draw things that I like or

2250
02:49:23,160 --> 02:49:24,760
um

2251
02:49:24,760 --> 02:49:26,760
I mean my art was like

2252
02:49:28,360 --> 02:49:31,240
Pretty pretty weird let's put it that way because

2253
02:49:32,040 --> 02:49:34,360
It was something like I remember um

2254
02:49:34,920 --> 02:49:38,920
At school I I used to like take uh

2255
02:49:40,840 --> 02:49:44,920
I majored like art and like

2256
02:49:45,880 --> 02:49:47,400
like

2257
02:49:47,400 --> 02:49:48,920
school and

2258
02:49:48,920 --> 02:49:51,560
They had like this like big exam thing

2259
02:49:52,280 --> 02:49:54,280
Where they give you like

2260
02:49:54,360 --> 02:49:55,640
um

2261
02:49:55,640 --> 02:49:58,440
Like a really big art project to work on

2262
02:49:59,480 --> 02:50:01,480
and then like

2263
02:50:01,480 --> 02:50:04,680
If you like art teachers like check it and

2264
02:50:05,640 --> 02:50:10,040
You know they give you like a score based of it and all that stuff and

2265
02:50:10,920 --> 02:50:12,040
um

2266
02:50:12,040 --> 02:50:14,040
basically my project

2267
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:16,040
um for that was

2268
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:19,160
Just mainly like

2269
02:50:19,720 --> 02:50:21,720
My my art project was uh

2270
02:50:22,200 --> 02:50:25,800
Based on the different parts of my personality

2271
02:50:25,880 --> 02:50:31,080
So I basically drew like a couple of different artworks that I felt

2272
02:50:32,200 --> 02:50:37,880
Showcased and represented like parts of my personality and different sides of me

2273
02:50:38,600 --> 02:50:42,840
So some of them would be like really weird or morbid

2274
02:50:44,680 --> 02:50:47,480
Some of them would even like include like

2275
02:50:48,360 --> 02:50:51,960
Like portraits of like people that meant a lot to me

2276
02:50:53,880 --> 02:50:55,880
Some of them would include like something

2277
02:50:57,720 --> 02:51:00,120
More like cute and stuff like that

2278
02:51:00,920 --> 02:51:05,640
And you know it was like kind of over the place but surprisingly uh

2279
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:10,120
Surprisingly I got like the highest score

2280
02:51:11,480 --> 02:51:14,920
I got I got surprisingly the highest score in that exam out of

2281
02:51:15,720 --> 02:51:18,120
Everyone and I remember um

2282
02:51:19,160 --> 02:51:24,280
The person who was like, you know giving the scores and checking it telling me that

2283
02:51:25,400 --> 02:51:27,400
Like I don't know that I was like

2284
02:51:27,720 --> 02:51:30,680
Extremely creative or something like that and

2285
02:51:32,120 --> 02:51:34,040
I don't know

2286
02:51:34,040 --> 02:51:37,480
Stuff like that, but you know eventually with time

2287
02:51:38,280 --> 02:51:40,280
uh, I just started like

2288
02:51:41,880 --> 02:51:43,400
Uh

2289
02:51:43,400 --> 02:51:47,320
Doing art less and less, you know like uh

2290
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:54,760
I'm I'm just all about making shitty ugly doodles with my fucking mouse

2291
02:51:55,720 --> 02:52:04,040
At this point of my life because it's stress-free. It's it's funny. It's stress-free. It's funny. I

2292
02:52:05,320 --> 02:52:10,920
If it looks like shit, it makes it even funnier. So I don't know. It's it's just not really

2293
02:52:12,200 --> 02:52:15,160
Not really my thing anymore, you know sometimes sometimes

2294
02:52:16,840 --> 02:52:19,800
As you grow up like you're still trying to figure out yourself, right?

2295
02:52:19,800 --> 02:52:22,680
So there will be times when like you've had hobbies that you

2296
02:52:23,560 --> 02:52:25,560
Were extremely

2297
02:52:25,640 --> 02:52:27,640
passionate with and

2298
02:52:27,960 --> 02:52:32,120
That you really thought you're going to make like a career out of them or something and then

2299
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:39,000
As time goes by and like different things happen to you in life and you gain different experiences like

2300
02:52:39,960 --> 02:52:43,880
You know, sometimes you just don't feel anything about

2301
02:52:45,480 --> 02:52:48,120
Those hobbies anymore. They don't make you happy anymore

2302
02:52:48,920 --> 02:52:52,840
So that's I guess that's kind of how it was for me for me and learn

2303
02:52:53,720 --> 02:52:58,440
I just like making ugly funny silly doodles with my mouse and

2304
02:52:59,320 --> 02:53:03,720
That's that's the enjoyment. That's like the most enjoyment that I get out of

2305
02:53:04,520 --> 02:53:07,480
Making art if you can call it that

2306
02:53:08,920 --> 02:53:16,040
Um, but if you want, uh, I could show you like I have um, I actually have some of the art

2307
02:53:16,200 --> 02:53:21,800
That I made for that big art project exam back then. I have some

2308
02:53:22,920 --> 02:53:24,440
Pictures of it

2309
02:53:24,440 --> 02:53:30,440
I could show you but I also don't want to like weird you out. It's like because like I don't know

2310
02:53:31,800 --> 02:53:36,200
I don't know if like the art that I made back then like would make you like think weirdly of me because

2311
02:53:37,080 --> 02:53:40,120
Some of it is like really weird or maybe like

2312
02:53:41,400 --> 02:53:43,480
I don't know. I don't know

2313
02:53:43,960 --> 02:53:47,960
I don't know. That was just really something

2314
02:53:50,760 --> 02:53:53,480
Art is subjective weird way. Yeah art is

2315
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:58,040
Art is art like it can be anything and

2316
02:53:59,400 --> 02:54:01,880
A way to express yourself

2317
02:54:02,600 --> 02:54:04,600
Oh, please. I would love to see

2318
02:54:04,760 --> 02:54:06,120
um

2319
02:54:06,120 --> 02:54:08,600
Maybe maybe I will I will show it eventually

2320
02:54:09,560 --> 02:54:17,400
Well, I'll have parts of our past that no longer apply but still explain how we got to where we are. Yeah, I think that's definitely true

2321
02:54:18,840 --> 02:54:21,240
I I definitely agree like

2322
02:54:22,840 --> 02:54:24,840
They were like part of

2323
02:54:25,960 --> 02:54:27,720
Like our

2324
02:54:27,720 --> 02:54:29,720
development as

2325
02:54:29,720 --> 02:54:31,720
A person

2326
02:54:31,880 --> 02:54:33,320
You know

2327
02:54:33,320 --> 02:54:36,200
That's why I also think that like if like

2328
02:54:37,160 --> 02:54:42,360
Maybe you if someone like did do something bad in the past

2329
02:54:42,920 --> 02:54:45,800
And and I'm not talking about like extremes here

2330
02:54:46,440 --> 02:54:48,920
Like, you know, but I'm talking about like

2331
02:54:49,960 --> 02:54:53,560
You know, like more generally like speaking stuff

2332
02:54:54,520 --> 02:54:55,720
Uh

2333
02:54:55,720 --> 02:55:00,440
Fuck what am I even trying to say? I'm just trying to say that like it's

2334
02:55:01,400 --> 02:55:05,880
It's part of your growth and and it's part of your growth and at the end of the day

2335
02:55:05,960 --> 02:55:08,680
What I think really really matters at the end of the day

2336
02:55:09,560 --> 02:55:11,560
is that

2337
02:55:11,880 --> 02:55:14,840
You you strive to be a better person and that you

2338
02:55:16,040 --> 02:55:18,440
You know want to be better and

2339
02:55:19,160 --> 02:55:20,760
you know like

2340
02:55:20,760 --> 02:55:24,840
That like you are self aware. I think self awareness is very important

2341
02:55:25,800 --> 02:55:27,880
I don't know if that makes sense what I'm trying to say

2342
02:55:28,440 --> 02:55:30,440
I'm kind of just yapping

2343
02:55:30,760 --> 02:55:32,760
around and

2344
02:55:32,760 --> 02:55:36,280
Basically don't focus too much on what you did in the past

2345
02:55:36,920 --> 02:55:40,200
And just have self aware awareness to know that like, yeah

2346
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:47,320
You know what I did back then was like really shitty or really bad and I don't want to ever do that again

2347
02:55:48,200 --> 02:55:50,600
I don't I don't want to be that person or

2348
02:55:52,760 --> 02:55:54,760
Stuff like that and just like

2349
02:55:55,880 --> 02:55:57,800
Make growth

2350
02:55:57,880 --> 02:55:59,480
out of that

2351
02:55:59,480 --> 02:56:05,480
I don't know why I'm talking about that. I feel like it's so weird that I'm talking about this stuff right now. I'm sorry if it's like

2352
02:56:06,680 --> 02:56:11,640
Really like too serious or like a really weird thing to talk about. I don't

2353
02:56:12,600 --> 02:56:16,920
Uh, I'm just like I'm just rambling honestly at this point

2354
02:56:19,320 --> 02:56:22,840
Learn from the past grow as a person. Yeah, exactly

2355
02:56:24,200 --> 02:56:26,360
I think I think the end goal is

2356
02:56:27,240 --> 02:56:30,840
To be the best version of yourself that you can be

2357
02:56:32,120 --> 02:56:34,120
and

2358
02:56:34,120 --> 02:56:36,120
And as I always say

2359
02:56:36,440 --> 02:56:38,440
as I always say

2360
02:56:38,680 --> 02:56:40,680
Being your authentic self

2361
02:56:41,480 --> 02:56:43,480
easier ideal self

2362
02:56:44,040 --> 02:56:47,400
I don't know. I I just I don't keep repeating that quote, but

2363
02:56:48,680 --> 02:56:50,680
Whenever I get insecure or

2364
02:56:51,400 --> 02:56:53,400
nervous I

2365
02:56:53,400 --> 02:56:55,400
I keep reminding it to myself

2366
02:56:56,920 --> 02:56:58,920
And

2367
02:56:59,880 --> 02:57:02,200
Is this how the pillow talk is gonna be like

2368
02:57:04,440 --> 02:57:06,440
I don't know. I don't know

2369
02:57:07,400 --> 02:57:11,640
Uh, I don't know if it's weird that I'm talking about all this stuff. I'm sorry if it is

2370
02:57:14,440 --> 02:57:20,920
Not weird at all it helps us to understand and connect more with you. I'm glad to hear that. That's that's really nice

2371
02:57:26,520 --> 02:57:33,000
Honestly, I love it. No, I'm really glad to hear that

2372
02:57:36,120 --> 02:57:38,760
Just be the best you can be. Yeah, pretty much

2373
02:57:39,640 --> 02:57:41,640
Yeah, I second that. Yeah

2374
02:57:42,760 --> 02:57:44,760
You learn more from a mistake

2375
02:57:45,720 --> 02:57:49,240
That that a job will do most of the time. Yeah

2376
02:57:50,440 --> 02:57:52,440
That that is true and you also

2377
02:57:53,160 --> 02:57:55,160
you also learn from

2378
02:57:55,480 --> 02:57:59,320
Actual experience as well, you know

2379
02:58:03,720 --> 02:58:08,760
It's fine. I see just be safe and no docs. Okay, I'm not doxing myself. I'm not like

2380
02:58:10,120 --> 02:58:12,120
I'm not giving you

2381
02:58:13,160 --> 02:58:17,240
I'm not giving you my address or nothing. I'm just talking about like my

2382
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
My life and

2383
02:58:21,640 --> 02:58:23,640
How I am and just

2384
02:58:24,200 --> 02:58:26,600
For you to get a better idea of

2385
02:58:27,240 --> 02:58:29,240
What I am as a person, I guess

2386
02:58:29,880 --> 02:58:33,000
It's just really nice to be able to talk about this stuff to be honest

2387
02:58:37,640 --> 02:58:39,640
Oh, oh my god

2388
02:58:39,880 --> 02:58:42,760
Vatams, thank you so much for the 99

02:58:59,400 --> 02:59:02,680
Kind minister love. Thank you so much. I

2395
02:59:03,720 --> 02:59:06,360
I just this feels so spoiled. That's

2396
02:59:07,080 --> 02:59:09,080
It's it's a weird feeling

2397
02:59:09,160 --> 02:59:21,000
We know just be safe, you know, we still want you here. Yeah. Yeah, I I know I I try to be as

2398
02:59:22,120 --> 02:59:24,680
As good as I can be about my

2399
02:59:26,360 --> 02:59:28,360
Uh, what's the word ops?

2400
02:59:28,600 --> 02:59:30,200
Ops bag

2401
02:59:30,200 --> 02:59:33,640
Ops bag. I don't remember something about that

2402
02:59:35,560 --> 02:59:37,800
And we enjoy spoiling you so it works

2403
02:59:39,320 --> 02:59:43,240
Yeah, but like the thing is you enjoy spoiling me but

2404
02:59:44,120 --> 02:59:47,560
I I sometimes like feel like guilty and like

2405
02:59:49,240 --> 02:59:52,440
Like bad and you know about it because I'm like

2406
02:59:53,640 --> 02:59:59,800
I don't feel like I I deserve like I really didn't do much, you know, like I didn't I don't know

2407
02:59:59,800 --> 03:00:01,800
You

2408
03:00:05,960 --> 03:00:11,240
Make us feel so good that we want to make you feel good in return. Oh, that's really sweet

2409
03:00:12,360 --> 03:00:15,960
All of you really make me happy like genuinely

2410
03:00:20,120 --> 03:00:22,520
I I can't remember exactly but

2411
03:00:24,200 --> 03:00:29,240
Uh, I can't remember exactly what she be was talking about in one of her streams

2412
03:00:30,600 --> 03:00:32,600
I think maybe yesterday, but

2413
03:00:33,240 --> 03:00:35,240
She was saying something that

2414
03:00:36,040 --> 03:00:43,240
I felt a similar way about you know, like like, you know how sometimes like I get worried and I'm like

2415
03:00:46,280 --> 03:00:50,200
You know like overthinking stuff overthinking the future and

2416
03:00:52,920 --> 03:00:57,560
And just like think about it too much. I'm like like I feel a similar way that

2417
03:00:58,120 --> 03:01:00,120
She be does in the sense that like

2418
03:01:01,080 --> 03:01:03,320
I just I just want everyone to

2419
03:01:04,120 --> 03:01:06,120
To be happy, you know and like

2420
03:01:08,360 --> 03:01:09,960
And like

2421
03:01:09,960 --> 03:01:13,480
Some of us are like really deep in it

2422
03:01:14,840 --> 03:01:16,840
More and more every day and

2423
03:01:18,680 --> 03:01:25,400
And like that part is scary when I overthink it overthink it because I think about the future and I'm like

2424
03:01:26,360 --> 03:01:31,000
I don't I don't want to hurt anyone, you know, like at the end of the day

2425
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:34,680
I want everyone to be happy and I guess when I think about the future it scares me because I

2426
03:01:36,600 --> 03:01:38,600
I don't want to

2427
03:01:39,880 --> 03:01:42,840
Break anyone's heart, you know, I don't

2428
03:01:46,120 --> 03:01:49,640
I I want everyone to be happy, you know and

2429
03:01:49,960 --> 03:01:51,960
And

2430
03:01:52,760 --> 03:01:55,640
When you get like so deep in it like you can't help but

2431
03:01:57,560 --> 03:02:02,280
Think about the future and like overthinking and be like

2432
03:02:04,120 --> 03:02:07,160
Uh think about like what ifs or

2433
03:02:09,560 --> 03:02:12,760
And I'm trying not to think like that, you know, I'm trying not to think like that

2434
03:02:12,760 --> 03:02:15,960
I'm trying to really just live in the moment and

2435
03:02:16,680 --> 03:02:19,400
And enjoy the present because that is

2436
03:02:21,560 --> 03:02:25,720
That is exactly the best way to live, right? But when you are

2437
03:02:26,680 --> 03:02:32,680
In it like really deep it it feels really difficult not to think about that stuff

2438
03:02:36,840 --> 03:02:42,040
Like I don't know so I guess it's like I don't know I don't know what I'm

2439
03:02:42,840 --> 03:02:48,040
I don't even know what like the point I'm trying to make is honestly, I just

2440
03:02:49,240 --> 03:02:52,200
I don't know. I just I just want everyone to be happy and I

2441
03:02:53,480 --> 03:02:59,000
And it's scary, you know scared because I'm I'm scared of anyone ever like

2442
03:03:01,560 --> 03:03:05,080
Getting hurt or anything like that like

2443
03:03:07,080 --> 03:03:09,080
I don't know

2444
03:03:09,080 --> 03:03:11,080
I don't know how how to word it

2445
03:03:12,040 --> 03:03:13,800
but

2446
03:03:13,800 --> 03:03:15,800
basically

2447
03:03:15,800 --> 03:03:17,800
Yeah a similar feeling to

2448
03:03:18,680 --> 03:03:22,840
What she be was talking about yesterday. I think it was yesterday. Um

2449
03:03:23,800 --> 03:03:27,080
No, it wasn't yesterday or was it

2450
03:03:28,360 --> 03:03:32,360
I don't I don't remember there was like a stream where she talked about something similar and

2451
03:03:33,160 --> 03:03:35,160
I was like, yeah like

2452
03:03:36,360 --> 03:03:39,880
Sometimes I would think that and I'm trying my best not to I really am

2453
03:03:40,840 --> 03:03:42,840
Trying to you know

2454
03:03:44,200 --> 03:03:46,200
Just enjoy the present but

2455
03:03:46,680 --> 03:03:48,680
It's so difficult, you know

2456
03:03:48,680 --> 03:03:52,040
It's it's so difficult like not think about it, you know

2457
03:03:53,400 --> 03:03:58,840
Like because you don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. You want everyone to be happy

2458
03:04:00,520 --> 03:04:02,520
Like I generally want

2459
03:04:03,320 --> 03:04:05,800
Everyone that's been really kind and sweet to me have

2460
03:04:06,680 --> 03:04:08,680
a really good life and

2461
03:04:08,760 --> 03:04:11,240
Be happy, you know like and

2462
03:04:13,160 --> 03:04:16,120
It would just feel so horrible to like hurt anyone and

2463
03:04:17,800 --> 03:04:19,800
Because I don't know

2464
03:04:21,240 --> 03:04:24,280
Feelings I feel

2465
03:04:26,920 --> 03:04:31,800
Just gonna randomly end the stream again and exit obs because I feel

2466
03:04:34,280 --> 03:04:36,280
I feel

2467
03:04:38,760 --> 03:04:42,200
I understand always be here and it's okay. I know what you mean. Yeah

2468
03:04:43,800 --> 03:04:45,800
How how does one

2469
03:04:46,920 --> 03:04:48,920
Not think about it. How does one just

2470
03:04:50,760 --> 03:04:53,800
Stop worrying about it like how do you even do that?

2471
03:04:57,480 --> 03:05:04,120
I feel bad like this is like this is like a heavy conversation we're having and I feel like really bad

2472
03:05:04,200 --> 03:05:06,200
I

2473
03:05:07,720 --> 03:05:15,880
Feelings are complicated and love especially but it's all worth it. Yeah, it is complicated

2474
03:05:20,120 --> 03:05:24,680
Uh, I couldn't answer that alone, but I feel

2475
03:05:26,360 --> 03:05:28,360
The way I feel

2476
03:05:28,440 --> 03:05:32,200
Uh, no point to do me when you can be blooming

2477
03:05:34,280 --> 03:05:36,280
Uh

2478
03:05:37,800 --> 03:05:39,800
True

2479
03:05:40,200 --> 03:05:41,960
True

2480
03:05:41,960 --> 03:05:43,960
I don't know if it gives an anime

2481
03:05:44,920 --> 03:05:47,800
I'm sorry, but I feel my emotions extremely strong

2482
03:05:49,800 --> 03:05:53,080
I don't think because an anime would like fix my fucking

2483
03:05:54,040 --> 03:05:58,600
Depression if I got like extremely fucking sad or something happened, you know

2484
03:05:59,640 --> 03:06:01,640
That would like

2485
03:06:01,640 --> 03:06:03,640
That would be like sad

2486
03:06:04,760 --> 03:06:07,320
I'm happy as long as I seen is happy

2487
03:06:08,760 --> 03:06:10,760
And I'm happy as long as you're happy

2488
03:06:12,600 --> 03:06:14,600
Sorry

2489
03:06:17,160 --> 03:06:20,280
I love you even if I can't be there next to you

2490
03:06:20,280 --> 03:06:23,560
I never thought I could be the spur of social before I started watching

2491
03:06:24,280 --> 03:06:26,280
You uh, I

2492
03:06:26,840 --> 03:06:31,240
That's really sweet. I I I actually feel the same way like I never

2493
03:06:32,040 --> 03:06:35,000
Felt like this before, you know

2494
03:06:36,440 --> 03:06:38,440
Like in my past

2495
03:06:39,320 --> 03:06:42,360
When I did stream like I never felt like

2496
03:06:43,800 --> 03:06:47,800
Like this much like this is like a whole like another

2497
03:06:49,400 --> 03:06:57,160
10 20 like levels of it, you know what I mean like it's it's like completely different than like anything I've ever experienced so

2498
03:06:58,120 --> 03:07:00,120
So yeah, it's

2499
03:07:01,160 --> 03:07:03,160
It's it's really something

2500
03:07:08,520 --> 03:07:11,160
I don't think you can stop the emotion

2501
03:07:12,280 --> 03:07:16,440
You just have to take the good and bad as they are. Yeah

2502
03:07:17,480 --> 03:07:19,480
That's true

2503
03:07:22,440 --> 03:07:26,280
Do you make this mister feel like a teenager in love again?

2504
03:07:27,560 --> 03:07:29,560
The ultimate fountain of youth

2505
03:07:30,600 --> 03:07:32,600
That's really sweet actually

2506
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:36,680
I think I think it's really sweet when some of you say that like

2507
03:07:37,640 --> 03:07:39,640
Stuff like that like, you know like

2508
03:07:40,680 --> 03:07:42,680
Make you feel young again or like

2509
03:07:43,480 --> 03:07:45,480
bring youth or

2510
03:07:45,720 --> 03:07:48,120
Stuff like that. I think that's really sweet

2511
03:07:48,760 --> 03:07:59,960
It's because of the nature of not say for not say for work work. I I disagree

2512
03:08:00,840 --> 03:08:02,600
I

2513
03:08:02,600 --> 03:08:04,600
Don't think that's why

2514
03:08:04,600 --> 03:08:08,040
I don't think that's why and I'll tell you why I used to

2515
03:08:08,760 --> 03:08:10,760
Before I even started v2 being

2516
03:08:12,040 --> 03:08:14,040
I used to do

2517
03:08:14,040 --> 03:08:16,040
Only fans

2518
03:08:16,760 --> 03:08:18,760
I used to do only fans for a few years and

2519
03:08:19,480 --> 03:08:22,040
You know like taking like pictures of myself

2520
03:08:22,840 --> 03:08:25,000
and like some cosplays and

2521
03:08:25,800 --> 03:08:27,800
stuff like that and

2522
03:08:28,760 --> 03:08:33,640
I never felt that way with like anybody, you know like the people who would

2523
03:08:34,520 --> 03:08:36,520
message me, you know

2524
03:08:37,320 --> 03:08:39,320
Or stuff like that like

2525
03:08:39,960 --> 03:08:41,960
I I never

2526
03:08:42,520 --> 03:08:45,000
I never felt like per social with them

2527
03:08:45,800 --> 03:08:50,600
So I don't I don't think it's I don't think it's because of the nature

2528
03:08:51,480 --> 03:08:53,000
of the

2529
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:55,000
not say for work

2530
03:08:55,320 --> 03:08:57,320
Thing because even when

2531
03:08:58,440 --> 03:09:02,040
I did like not say for work content before vlr

2532
03:09:02,760 --> 03:09:05,000
I never felt like per social with

2533
03:09:06,440 --> 03:09:08,440
For the people, you know what I mean

2534
03:09:09,160 --> 03:09:13,960
Like I never felt like this. So with you it's like it's completely different

2535
03:09:15,960 --> 03:09:17,960
Only pause

2536
03:09:21,080 --> 03:09:27,080
It's about the authenticity of the interactions between parties maybe yeah, I think that's what it is because like

2537
03:09:28,200 --> 03:09:29,800
because like

2538
03:09:29,800 --> 03:09:33,960
Right now like it's not just it's not just like

2539
03:09:34,760 --> 03:09:36,760
sexual stuff, right like

2540
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:40,520
We we spend time together like we talk about

2541
03:09:41,560 --> 03:09:43,560
actual like

2542
03:09:43,640 --> 03:09:48,200
You know life we we talk about deeper things sometimes we

2543
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:52,680
You see me stream and just be my silly funny self and

2544
03:09:54,920 --> 03:10:01,800
And stuff like that like you're getting to know like the actual like person on a deeper level, you know

2545
03:10:02,840 --> 03:10:04,840
and

2546
03:10:05,640 --> 03:10:07,640
And I think that's like where

2547
03:10:08,600 --> 03:10:11,000
Those kind of stuff start to develop

2548
03:10:11,960 --> 03:10:16,200
Like if it's just if it's just actual then like

2549
03:10:18,360 --> 03:10:20,360
I don't know

2550
03:10:20,600 --> 03:10:22,600
It doesn't like

2551
03:10:23,640 --> 03:10:28,040
Like I need to have emotions basically I need to have emotions for like

2552
03:10:29,560 --> 03:10:31,560
Like the whole sex thing to be like

2553
03:10:32,440 --> 03:10:35,880
You know like I wanted to mean something. I don't want it to be just like

2554
03:10:36,840 --> 03:10:38,840
Whatever, you know

2555
03:10:39,480 --> 03:10:44,120
That's why that's why when like people ask me about like tributes or stuff like that

2556
03:10:44,840 --> 03:10:46,840
You know the sexual ones

2557
03:10:46,840 --> 03:10:48,840
I'm like

2558
03:10:48,920 --> 03:10:50,920
only only if you love me and

2559
03:10:51,640 --> 03:10:53,640
only if you don't

2560
03:10:53,640 --> 03:10:56,760
flirt with other girls because to me like

2561
03:10:57,960 --> 03:10:58,920
uh

2562
03:10:58,920 --> 03:11:00,920
those are like a form of

2563
03:11:01,240 --> 03:11:02,440
intimacy

2564
03:11:02,440 --> 03:11:07,960
That you share with one another in a special way. So like if someone sends me a tribute

2565
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:12,200
And there's no message attached to it and it's just like

2566
03:11:13,160 --> 03:11:15,480
A random dick joking off like

2567
03:11:16,120 --> 03:11:21,560
It genuinely doesn't do anything for me. Like I don't feel anything. I don't fucking I don't care

2568
03:11:22,680 --> 03:11:24,680
You know what I mean

2569
03:11:24,680 --> 03:11:29,480
And also to clarify also to clarify another thing like you can

2570
03:11:32,120 --> 03:11:36,680
I think I think people are misunderstanding some stuff. I think there is like a misunderstanding

2571
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:39,800
You know like you can still watch

2572
03:11:40,520 --> 03:11:42,200
like the other

2573
03:11:42,200 --> 03:11:47,400
Like my gen mates and stuff or like support them like of course like they're amazing

2574
03:11:48,200 --> 03:11:52,200
What what we don't want what we don't want you to do is to

2575
03:11:53,240 --> 03:11:55,240
say like

2576
03:11:55,480 --> 03:12:01,400
Oh, I love you. Oh, I'm in love with you. You know, oh, I want to be with you. Oh, I'm in love with you

2577
03:12:02,120 --> 03:12:06,760
And and you're my favorite or and then you go and like same the same shit

2578
03:12:07,720 --> 03:12:12,680
To all the other girls like that's that's just fucking stupid. Just don't say it at all at that point

2579
03:12:13,640 --> 03:12:15,640
like

2580
03:12:15,800 --> 03:12:19,480
Just stop, you know, it's like specifically about

2581
03:12:20,120 --> 03:12:21,880
tributes and

2582
03:12:21,880 --> 03:12:24,440
You know flirting and I know we're supposed to be like

2583
03:12:26,120 --> 03:12:28,440
A horpo, but for me specifically like

2584
03:12:28,440 --> 03:12:35,240
Like I'm not gonna lie like I am getting very I am getting like very attached, you know

2585
03:12:35,960 --> 03:12:37,960
I can't help my feelings like

2586
03:12:38,440 --> 03:12:40,440
I I didn't plan for this to happen

2587
03:12:40,520 --> 03:12:47,000
Like I'll I I'll be honest like when I joined I my plan was to just be purely sexual and

2588
03:12:47,640 --> 03:12:48,520
like

2589
03:12:48,520 --> 03:12:49,560
not

2590
03:12:49,560 --> 03:12:51,880
You know not not care about those kind of stuff and

2591
03:12:52,760 --> 03:12:57,960
Not not like let it mean anything, you know just purely sexual, you know

2592
03:12:58,040 --> 03:13:00,040
but

2593
03:13:00,360 --> 03:13:05,640
But you're all like so kind and sweet to me and just such amazing people that like

2594
03:13:06,600 --> 03:13:10,360
We just we just naturally like started getting closer and closer and

2595
03:13:11,480 --> 03:13:12,680
so

2596
03:13:12,680 --> 03:13:14,680
So yeah, so basically

2597
03:13:15,640 --> 03:13:17,320
uh

2598
03:13:17,320 --> 03:13:22,600
How do I how do I say it in in a way that is not misunderstood

2599
03:13:25,320 --> 03:13:27,320
Uh just

2600
03:13:28,920 --> 03:13:30,920
Just don't be stupid

2601
03:13:31,480 --> 03:13:35,640
Just just just don't lie. Just don't lie. Just don't

2602
03:13:37,640 --> 03:13:40,360
Don't say things that you don't mean, you know

2603
03:13:41,320 --> 03:13:44,520
Like don't don't go into a girl's

2604
03:13:45,320 --> 03:13:50,120
Freaking stream and be like, oh, you're my favorite. Oh, I love you

2605
03:13:51,080 --> 03:13:53,320
I'm genuinely so in love with you

2606
03:13:54,280 --> 03:13:58,520
I have feelings for you and I think about you and blah blah and then

2607
03:13:59,480 --> 03:14:04,040
And then you go to like all the other girls and you go and say the same shit

2608
03:14:05,480 --> 03:14:07,480
Or or something similar

2609
03:14:08,120 --> 03:14:09,320
like

2610
03:14:09,320 --> 03:14:12,040
Just just be a decent person and just

2611
03:14:12,920 --> 03:14:14,920
Don't say that if you don't mean it

2612
03:14:15,560 --> 03:14:21,320
Don't say things that you don't mean basically. It's really that simple. Honestly. It's really not that difficult just

2613
03:14:23,400 --> 03:14:26,360
Just don't say that stuff, you know, if you don't mean it, you know

2614
03:14:26,760 --> 03:14:33,800
You can still you can still be a decent person and watch all of us and support all of us and be a decent person about it, you know

2615
03:14:36,120 --> 03:14:38,120
I feel like it's really simple to do that

2616
03:14:39,320 --> 03:14:42,920
Do many people do that? I don't know but like

2617
03:14:43,880 --> 03:14:49,000
But there was like one person like on twitter. I think I don't know if some of you saw it

2618
03:14:49,400 --> 03:14:52,200
I think you saw it because like I add mercy about it

2619
03:14:53,800 --> 03:14:57,000
On twitter and I was like, there's a fucking cheater in here

2620
03:14:57,640 --> 03:15:04,360
Bro, it's like telling me this mister loves you so much and then he has this fucking oshi mark of mercy

2621
03:15:05,160 --> 03:15:07,160
like bro

2622
03:15:07,640 --> 03:15:09,160
Have some like

2623
03:15:09,160 --> 03:15:10,840
tagged

2624
03:15:10,840 --> 03:15:12,680
Like hello

2625
03:15:12,680 --> 03:15:18,360
I hate that shit like genuinely. I genuinely hate that shit. It pisses me off so much

2626
03:15:19,480 --> 03:15:21,480
Like what the fuck is your problem?

2627
03:15:24,280 --> 03:15:26,280
Like what

2628
03:15:27,400 --> 03:15:33,080
What I just I just don't get it. I personally personally I don't get it. I don't

2629
03:15:33,960 --> 03:15:36,360
If you don't mean something just don't say it. It's

2630
03:15:37,560 --> 03:15:40,760
I don't know. I'm probably like overreacting honestly

2631
03:15:41,480 --> 03:15:43,480
I'm probably overreacting

2632
03:15:44,040 --> 03:15:46,760
And stuff and I'm sorry if I am

2633
03:15:48,360 --> 03:15:52,200
But I felt like it was like a big thing to touch subject on

2634
03:15:52,760 --> 03:15:54,120
You know

2635
03:15:54,120 --> 03:15:55,880
as

2636
03:15:55,880 --> 03:15:57,160
You know

2637
03:15:57,160 --> 03:16:04,280
I I didn't plan to feel the way that I do, you know the plan was to keep it purely sexual but

2638
03:16:05,400 --> 03:16:06,920
you know

2639
03:16:06,920 --> 03:16:10,440
feelings feelings and things change when you know you meet some

2640
03:16:11,240 --> 03:16:13,400
decent people that are really sweet to you

2641
03:16:14,200 --> 03:16:18,120
And treat you well surprise surprise and then you get attached to them like

2642
03:16:19,640 --> 03:16:21,640
That's that happened

2643
03:16:22,040 --> 03:16:23,640
You you build

2644
03:16:23,640 --> 03:16:25,640
a form connection, you know

2645
03:16:29,720 --> 03:16:31,720
Someone told me to check my donations

2646
03:16:34,120 --> 03:16:38,440

2653
03:17:11,640 --> 03:17:12,840
3d

2654
03:17:12,840 --> 03:17:14,840

Just set something like that up in the future like

03:17:33,080 --> 03:17:37,480
That's like like, you know one of my big dreams that I have I think it would be so cool

Oh my god, you're still streaming I know I'm surprised too

2661
03:17:43,720 --> 03:17:47,640
I'm surprised too that I'm still streaming. I'll be honest with you

2662
03:17:48,680 --> 03:17:53,800
I'm surprised because you know, I usually like just just leave after two hours

2663

Uh, but today's conversations like have just been like so pleasant and

2664

03:18:13,880 --> 03:18:16,200

Thank you so much for the six dollar donation. Thank you so much

2669
03:18:22,040 --> 03:18:25,640
Uh, suddenly I don't have much money to give out randomly, but

2670
03:18:26,280 --> 03:18:28,600
I wanted to give my sweet bear

2671
03:18:29,240 --> 03:18:30,680

2672
03:18:30,680 --> 03:18:34,600
I've I've been uh surprisingly happy since I found you

In a positive way. That's really sweet and

2679
03:19:03,720 --> 03:19:09,240
Like don't don't worry about like stuff like money or anything. Please again, like I said, it's

2680
03:19:10,040 --> 03:19:16,760
No, there's like no pressure. Please always take care of yourself. Um, but I really appreciate the message and

2681
03:19:17,800 --> 03:19:20,120
Thank you for the really sweet words

2682
03:19:21,560 --> 03:19:26,760
You're gonna change stream title icy deer. I will once I'm done streaming

2683
03:19:27,320 --> 03:19:30,280
This is not like twitch where you can just change the title

2684
03:19:31,960 --> 03:19:34,120
In the middle of the stream. I don't think

2685
03:19:35,320 --> 03:19:36,520
If it is possible

2686
03:19:36,600 --> 03:19:41,640
I don't know. I'm scared that it's just gonna make like the stream fucking die or something

2687
03:19:41,880 --> 03:19:46,200
Like I don't want a repeat of yesterday where I'm like talking and in the middle of it

2688
03:19:46,360 --> 03:19:48,520
Maybe it's fucking dies or something

2689
03:19:50,600 --> 03:19:52,600
I think you can actually

2690
03:19:52,600 --> 03:19:56,760
Is it is it not gonna like fuck up like the stream or like something?

2691
03:19:57,560 --> 03:19:59,560
I feel

2692
03:20:02,360 --> 03:20:04,840
Tell me again, how did the stream become is that so

2693
03:20:05,720 --> 03:20:07,720
uh because

2694
03:20:08,200 --> 03:20:10,200
Because my my sweet

2695
03:20:10,440 --> 03:20:13,640
Snowberries are really fun and pleasant to talk to

2696
03:20:14,680 --> 03:20:16,840
And I just have so much fun

2697
03:20:18,200 --> 03:20:20,280
Talking to them, you know

2698
03:20:21,080 --> 03:20:22,600
so

2699
03:20:22,600 --> 03:20:28,600
It just naturally developed into is awesome because I love talking to my snowberries

2700
03:20:29,320 --> 03:20:31,400
You know, it's it's really that simple

2701
03:20:31,960 --> 03:20:39,080
Because she loves this and kept talking. Yeah, exactly like I love talking to you like I'm having so much fun

2702
03:20:39,080 --> 03:20:41,560
This is like this is like so great like that's

2703
03:20:42,280 --> 03:20:45,560
That's honestly like a big thing that I always wanted to do like I always like

2704
03:20:46,840 --> 03:20:49,640
I wanted to be able to like sometimes like have just like

2705
03:20:50,440 --> 03:20:51,640
run those

2706
03:20:51,640 --> 03:20:59,160
Streams where we just hang out together and talk about like whatever just like relaxing together like not necessarily gaming or anything

2707
03:21:00,040 --> 03:21:04,360
Just talking about different subjects and enjoying each other's company, you know

2708
03:21:06,760 --> 03:21:10,840
We're more appealing than playing a video game good ego boost

2709
03:21:11,800 --> 03:21:13,800
That it is true though

2710
03:21:14,040 --> 03:21:17,960
It is true though, like I I have trouble finding games that I enjoy so

2711
03:21:19,480 --> 03:21:21,480
Surprise surprise like I actually like

2712
03:21:22,520 --> 03:21:26,440
Uh feel like I have a lot more fun just talking to you like today

2713
03:21:27,160 --> 03:21:29,160
I

2714
03:21:29,160 --> 03:21:31,640
I still love like playing like games on stream don't get me wrong

2715
03:21:32,120 --> 03:21:37,560
That's really fun as well because a lot of like funny memes happen out of it, you know a lot of like

2716
03:21:38,280 --> 03:21:41,320
You know like things happen during it. So it is fun

2717
03:21:42,920 --> 03:21:48,040
Uh, can we do this more often cob? You really make everything better

2718
03:21:49,960 --> 03:21:53,400
Sorry, um, yeah, I'll I'll think about it

2719
03:21:56,680 --> 03:21:58,680
Maybe

2720
03:21:59,080 --> 03:22:01,720
Uh, then tomorrow is a dj stream. No

2721
03:22:02,520 --> 03:22:05,640
No, there is no dj stream tomorrow tomorrow is my

2722
03:22:06,600 --> 03:22:11,080
Tomorrow we're doing a movie watch along and then after that a members only

2723
03:22:11,640 --> 03:22:14,520
Drunk karaoke. That's what's going to happen tomorrow

2724
03:22:15,160 --> 03:22:20,680
The watch along is my monetization and membership opening celebration

2725
03:22:21,640 --> 03:22:22,760
so

2726
03:22:22,760 --> 03:22:25,480
Yeah, and the members only

2727
03:22:26,520 --> 03:22:29,400
Drunk karaoke. That's what's happening tomorrow

2728
03:22:32,040 --> 03:22:37,160
I love these streams. I'm glad I can't wait to finally remember you

2729
03:22:38,680 --> 03:22:41,320
I don't know why that sounded kind of loot to me

2730
03:22:44,120 --> 03:22:49,480
That's probably because I'm just have a loot mindset. Sorry

2731
03:22:50,200 --> 03:22:52,200
Um

2732
03:22:54,440 --> 03:22:59,400
Usually I just sleep till I have to work, but now I have something to look forward to

2733
03:23:00,120 --> 03:23:04,760
Oh, I feel the same way though. I feel the same way like every day I wake up

2734
03:23:05,560 --> 03:23:10,600
Like so excited, you know, like every day there's like something new and good to look forward to and

2735
03:23:11,480 --> 03:23:14,680
That's such a nice feeling, you know, I'm really happy

2736
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:17,000
Okay

2737
03:23:17,240 --> 03:23:19,240
It's an eager coded post

2738
03:23:21,960 --> 03:23:26,200
Uh, remember tier one is emotes and the rest can get more

2739
03:23:27,160 --> 03:23:28,280
perks

2740
03:23:28,280 --> 03:23:31,160
Uh, oh Jesus can think of yeah. Yeah. Yeah

2741
03:23:32,840 --> 03:23:36,440
Yeah, it just just the same way that strani has it

2742
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:42,760
You know tier one is like for the badges and the emotes and then tier two is for the

2743
03:23:43,320 --> 03:23:46,360
Member only streams and stuff like that

2744
03:23:47,320 --> 03:23:50,920
So just letting you know in advance that that's how it's gonna work

2745
03:23:53,240 --> 03:23:55,240
Except our members

2746
03:24:06,840 --> 03:24:12,600
How does strani have it that that's the way the chi has that I believe she has two tiers

2747
03:24:13,240 --> 03:24:16,600
Tier one is for emotes and the badges and tier two is for

2748
03:24:17,320 --> 03:24:23,800
The members only the streams and other content. I guess depends on what each girl does

2749
03:24:27,160 --> 03:24:31,880
Not sure if you saw it by the way, but I suggest earlier that you can do a member stream

2750
03:24:32,600 --> 03:24:38,120
Where you doodle us profile pics. Oh, I actually didn't see that. That's a that's a cute idea

2751
03:24:38,920 --> 03:24:42,040
Whoa, that's a good idea. Hold on. Let me copy that

2752
03:24:42,760 --> 03:24:44,760
Let me copy that in my notes

2753
03:24:45,080 --> 03:24:46,200
Real quick

2754
03:24:46,200 --> 03:24:49,480
Uh, that's actually a good idea. That would be a really cute member only stream

2755
03:24:50,200 --> 03:24:54,520
Making for all of you like your own custom profile picture. That would be so much fun

2756
03:24:55,160 --> 03:24:57,800
Whoa, I'm actually super excited to do that

2757
03:24:58,760 --> 03:25:04,760
Wow, that would be that would be actually really fun. I would love that like dry custom profile picture

2758
03:25:05,240 --> 03:25:08,360
For for all of you that are like members

2759
03:25:09,080 --> 03:25:11,080
That will be such a fun stream

2760
03:25:11,320 --> 03:25:13,320
Can just yap away while I

2761
03:25:14,120 --> 03:25:18,120
Well, I make you funny cute art for you two so it's a perfect picture

2762
03:25:21,400 --> 03:25:25,400
Is there gonna be a story in for you, you know

2763
03:25:29,560 --> 03:25:32,040
Um, I don't know

2764
03:25:36,040 --> 03:25:38,040
I don't know

2765
03:25:38,200 --> 03:25:40,200
for now, no, but

2766
03:25:40,840 --> 03:25:43,340
Who knows what the future will bring

2767
03:25:49,960 --> 03:25:51,960
You know that premium path

2768
03:25:57,000 --> 03:25:59,000
Oh my god

2769
03:25:59,880 --> 03:26:01,880
Meet and fuck for two

2770
03:26:02,120 --> 03:26:03,880
Oh god

2771
03:26:03,880 --> 03:26:05,720
Oh no

2772
03:26:05,720 --> 03:26:07,720
Not like this

2773
03:26:08,680 --> 03:26:10,680
Oh no

2774
03:26:19,960 --> 03:26:23,400
I see you're underestimating the member numbers, I think

2775
03:26:25,240 --> 03:26:27,000
I mean

2776
03:26:27,000 --> 03:26:29,400
I I don't know what to expect to be honest

2777
03:26:30,360 --> 03:26:34,200
I uh, you know, like I don't I don't really know what to expect

2778
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:37,640
Tomorrow, so I genuinely have no idea

2779
03:26:40,360 --> 03:26:42,360
So because we will see what happens, I don't know

2780
03:26:44,520 --> 03:26:46,520
Tier 4 premium path

2781
03:26:53,240 --> 03:26:59,960
Every time I think she'll get tired of blue joke she leans into them and then loses it that's that's just the way I am

2782
03:27:00,920 --> 03:27:04,840
And and I hope you like it. I hope you love the way that I am

2783
03:27:07,480 --> 03:27:09,480
I see battle pass

2784
03:27:11,960 --> 03:27:18,360
Oh my god, I see battle pass where you have to like do different quests like every day

2785
03:27:19,400 --> 03:27:22,840
To like hit like the max level of the battle pass

2786
03:27:23,160 --> 03:27:25,160
Hahaha

2787
03:27:27,640 --> 03:27:31,880
I can't think of a handful of names that will be great tomorrow

2788
03:27:34,280 --> 03:27:36,520
Oh, I'm sorry like yeah

2789
03:27:37,720 --> 03:27:42,440
And your battle pass to grind wink wink. Why would the quest even be?

2790
03:27:44,520 --> 03:27:46,520
I wonder

2791
03:27:47,080 --> 03:27:50,120
I wonder that's actually pretty funny

2792
03:27:50,200 --> 03:27:53,960
That's actually pretty funny to think about like even though it's like as a joke

2793
03:27:54,760 --> 03:27:57,160
That would still be like funny to think about it

2794
03:28:00,280 --> 03:28:02,440
The daily pass like quests are like

2795
03:28:03,960 --> 03:28:08,040
Oh you you have to today one of the quests is like

2796
03:28:08,760 --> 03:28:10,760
to send multiple like

2797
03:28:11,720 --> 03:28:14,200
audios of yourself or

2798
03:28:15,160 --> 03:28:22,520
Or like the next day you you need to draw fan art even even if you think it's gonna be like shitty art

2799
03:28:23,080 --> 03:28:27,160
You you still have to draw me even if you draw me as a stick i'm still gonna appreciate it

2800
03:28:28,280 --> 03:28:30,280
Because you've put time and effort into it

2801
03:28:35,880 --> 03:28:37,880
Uh

2802
03:28:38,840 --> 03:28:40,840
Oh

2803
03:28:41,400 --> 03:28:43,640
Shit that would actually be cool

2804
03:28:45,320 --> 03:28:48,520
I feel like that would be like too much. I don't know

2805
03:28:49,240 --> 03:28:55,640
But it's it's a funny concept. It's it's funny as it's like a fun concept to think about it

2806
03:28:56,760 --> 03:28:59,480
I don't know joke around about but I feel like in

2807
03:29:00,920 --> 03:29:02,920
In reality would be probably too much

2808
03:29:04,360 --> 03:29:06,360
I do that battle pass

2809
03:29:08,680 --> 03:29:10,680
Yeah, and you would do me as well

2810
03:29:15,080 --> 03:29:17,640
Oh no, i'm getting unhinged again. Oh no

2811
03:29:18,920 --> 03:29:21,640
Sister well fuck i've been yapping for like

2812
03:29:22,920 --> 03:29:26,040
Three hours and a half. What the fuck is my problem?

2813
03:29:27,720 --> 03:29:32,520
That's actually awesome, but it would be hard to come up with something every day. Yeah, that too

2814
03:29:32,760 --> 03:29:34,760
I

2815
03:29:35,320 --> 03:29:37,960
Love how the loot jokes just slip out of you. I see

2816
03:29:39,240 --> 03:29:43,240
Yeah, just like your count does out of my

2817
03:29:51,160 --> 03:29:57,480
Make sure to have some tea and take care of your voice after stream. Yeah, that's true. I definitely need to

2818
03:29:58,440 --> 03:30:05,400
Drink some tea after this stream. I don't remember the last time that I have talked this much non-stop

2819
03:30:06,520 --> 03:30:10,520
I genuinely don't remember so I am going to need to get some nice tea and

2820
03:30:11,320 --> 03:30:13,320
relax my voice

2821
03:30:13,400 --> 03:30:14,440
because

2822
03:30:14,440 --> 03:30:17,400
We have tomorrow's stream and i'm doing a karaoke so

2823
03:30:20,200 --> 03:30:23,720
So I need to make sure that my voice is still intact for tomorrow

2824
03:30:24,040 --> 03:30:28,440
Because I don't want because if I have a sore throat tomorrow and you know

2825
03:30:28,520 --> 03:30:33,320
My throat is in pain. I won't be able to do the karaoke and I don't want it to come to that

2826
03:30:40,200 --> 03:30:43,400
So no booty stuff? Well, what?

2827
03:30:44,440 --> 03:30:46,440
What do you mean?

2828
03:30:46,840 --> 03:30:49,480
Huh, what are you talking about?

2829
03:30:49,480 --> 03:30:56,040
What are you talking about? I almost want to just talk with people and make quick requests for ourselves

2830
03:30:59,160 --> 03:31:04,120
Okay, I really don't want to end this stream right now, but I think I will

2831
03:31:05,160 --> 03:31:09,640
Just so that I can save my voice for tomorrow because I can feel like my voice like

2832
03:31:11,000 --> 03:31:15,960
Like it's getting harder and harder for me to talk like I can feel my throat like feeling

2833
03:31:16,200 --> 03:31:18,200
Uh

2834
03:31:18,440 --> 03:31:22,920
Not not not the best right now. So I think it's a sign that I should

2835
03:31:24,360 --> 03:31:27,640
Rest and head out so that tomorrow I can

2836
03:31:28,600 --> 03:31:29,800
actually

2837
03:31:29,800 --> 03:31:31,800
do the

2838
03:31:31,960 --> 03:31:36,040
The drunk karaoke and and sing for you and I hope you will enjoy my

2839
03:31:37,160 --> 03:31:39,560
singing even if it's not good

2840
03:31:40,680 --> 03:31:41,800
and

2841
03:31:41,800 --> 03:31:43,800
that you will enjoy

2842
03:31:44,520 --> 03:31:48,040
Overall our time together tomorrow because tomorrow we're going to be spending

2843
03:31:49,320 --> 03:31:54,920
Even more time together like we spend more time together today, but tomorrow we will spend even more time

2844
03:31:55,640 --> 03:31:57,400
together

2845
03:31:57,400 --> 03:31:59,320
so yeah

2846
03:31:59,320 --> 03:32:01,320
You bless us with a long talking stream

2847
03:32:02,040 --> 03:32:05,400
And and you bless me with your amazing company. So thank you

2848
03:32:06,280 --> 03:32:10,200

2849
03:32:11,080 --> 03:32:13,080

2850
03:32:13,160 --> 03:32:14,680

2851

I will have to head out and get some tea and

2855
03:32:25,960 --> 03:32:29,320
Rest my voice so that tomorrow I can I can sing for you
