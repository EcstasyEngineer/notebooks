412680	416680	Hello my sweet snowberries. Hi.
416680	420680	Hello. Hello.
428680	434680	I hope that you are doing well today.
436680	442680	I have a bit of problems with my throat.
442680	464680	So if I don't speak as much as I usually do during my ASMR streams, that's why then on top of that I also have a migraine as well.
464680	474680	I take some painkillers before the stream but they still didn't kick in yet.
474680	484680	So sorry in advance if I'm not at my best performance today.
484680	488680	I hope you can understand.
494680	506680	Feel free to end stream really if it's too much. Yeah I will but for now I'm completely okay.
506680	512680	I miss you a lot and I really want to spend some time together.
524680	526680	Thank you.
554680	578680	So yesterday, as some of you know, I kind of had a day for disconnecting from you.
578680	588680	From what I do and from breathing anything and from social media etc.
588680	594680	And I'll be honest, it was so fucking difficult.
594680	598680	It was like really really difficult.
598680	606680	I legitimately felt like a physical feeling in my chest.
606680	622680	My chest felt really tight the whole day because I kept wanting to read everything and respond to things and all of that.
622680	630680	So it was really more difficult than I thought it would be.
630680	644680	And that's kind of scary because it literally felt like how people describe it when you're addicted to something.
644680	656680	And then you try to stop doing it and you just have the strongest urges to do it.
656680	668680	And you have to basically restrain yourself and it takes so much control and effort to do that.
668680	676680	With that being said, I don't think you realized actually what happened yesterday.
676680	680680	Yes, I did disconnect from everything.
680680	694680	However, I actually ended up not going outside because I was so sleepy and tired
694680	700680	that I ended up just like sleeping pretty much the whole day.
700680	704680	So basically what happened is I woke up.
704680	714680	I was awake for like a little bit, got sleepy, went back to sleep, woke up again.
714680	724680	I had lunch, watched some videos, felt sleepy again, went back to sleep again until like 6pm.
724680	728680	Like no joke, I woke up at like 6pm.
728680	734680	I was so sleepy, like really really sleepy.
734680	740680	And so when I woke up at like 6pm I was like fuck, I'm so tired.
740680	748680	Like I really really don't want to go anywhere.
748680	756680	So I just, yeah, yesterday was just me just sleeping pretty much.
756680	762680	I didn't go outside.
762680	774680	But I actually did go outside today because I still wanted to go outside like I promised myself.
774680	784680	So I did go outside and I just walked around and just breathed some nice fresh air.
784680	786680	The weather was really nice.
786680	792680	It was like warm but not overbearing, you know.
792680	796680	There was like a nice wind.
796680	804680	And actually in the middle of it it started raining really hard, like out of nowhere.
804680	812680	And everyone was like surprised because on the weather forecast it was not supposed to rain today.
812680	814680	But it did.
814680	820680	But it was really refreshing because I could smell, you know, that good scent of the rain.
820680	830680	So it was like, but fresh rain, scent.
830680	838680	It was extremely nice and refreshing.
838680	860680	And then I went to a store just to see if there's anything I need or if there's any like stuff that I could like maybe use for ASMR triggers.
860680	873680	And it's pretty crazy but when I was there, there was a song that started playing.
873680	885680	And the beginning of that song sounded a lot like fade into you, the song that I was singing at the karaoke.
885680	895680	So when I heard like the first few seconds of the melody, like I instantly like thought about, you know, the karaoke night we had.
895680	900680	And my heart like skipped a beat, you know.
900680	909680	And then, and not after that, they played Braining Man.
909680	913680	Like I'm not fucking kidding, they played Braining Man.
913680	919680	And I was like, no fucking way, no fucking way.
919680	931680	I thought it was really crazy because you know, I go outside to disconnect from you, right?
931680	934680	And not think about any of this.
934680	942680	But then even when I go outside, you know, to distract myself, there's things that remind me of you.
942680	952680	Like the songs from the karaoke that started playing and like instantly like my brain went, what the fuck?
952680	957680	Like no, no, no way that happened.
957680	968680	And I instantly, you know, smiled and remembered how amazing the karaoke was and how much fun I had.
972680	996680	I also ordered some food to get home with me.
996680	1013680	It was like this really, really good like dish salad that had like grilled vegetables and some lettuce and like small baby potatoes.
1013680	1017680	It was so freaking good, holy fuck.
1017680	1023680	Like I didn't not expect it to taste that good, but it was really, really fucking good.
1023680	1039680	I think I think it had like red peppers in it, eggplant, some lettuce and some, I don't know what else was there.
1039680	1049680	There were more stuff, but I don't remember the name of it, but anyways, it tasted really, really, really good as the point.
1049680	1056680	So I was really happy that I got that.
1056680	1068680	So when I was at the store, I bought like this lollipop chupa chups.
1068680	1071680	This is a lollipop candy.
1071680	1085680	I bought it because when I was a kid, I remember I used to really love these and I haven't had it since then, pretty much.
1085680	1097680	So I thought I could buy it and maybe I'll use it too for some of my smart triggers, possibly.
1102680	1105680	The flavor is strawberry.
1105680	1134680	And then I bought like this squishy stress toy, I guess.
1134680	1141680	It's very like bright pink, and it has like a really stupid and silly face.
1141680	1153680	And I thought maybe I could use it as an ASMR trigger, but to be fair, I don't know how good of a sound it makes.
1164680	1179680	It actually sounds pretty nice.
1179680	1188680	I'm glad to hear that, because the thing is, it was inside like a packaging.
1188680	1206680	So it was hard for me to figure out exactly what it's going to sound like outside of it, but it's a squishy toy, so I thought maybe it would make good sounds.
1206680	1211680	I also have bubble wrap.
1211680	1227680	I remember that someone has requested bubble wrap as an ASMR trigger, so today's your lucky day, because they have some bubble wrap.
1236680	1250680	The bubble wrap makes really, really good sounds, really tingly ones, I think.
1250680	1256680	So I have a feeling most of you would probably enjoy it.
1257680	1264680	Okay, let me bring the bubble wrap.
1264680	1266680	I can't wait to talk.
1286680	1315680	Right, it sounds so good, doesn't it?
1315680	1344680	I think bubble wrap makes really good sounds.
1344680	1348680	I think a decent bubble wrap makes a lot of sounds.
1375680	1387680	I'm kicking and thinking of forgetting a text from why is he saying this song remind me of you and the speaker explodes with a training man.
1387680	1390680	Thank you.
1391680	1393680	Super.
1406680	1410680	Packaging my tea sands up to ship them to your address.
1410680	1412680	Okay, real.
1413680	1415680	Thank you.
1419680	1421680	I'm here.
1421680	1431680	That's why I need to wrap you in bubble wrap so I can be shipped to your address.
1442680	1445680	Okay.

2414740	2422740	somber, thank you so much for joining funpush it, I love
2444740	2446740	you
2474740	2501740	how do you come up with these triggers?
2502740	2510740	I just look around the house and see if there's anything I can make good sounds with
2510740	2514740	that's pretty much all it is
2540740	2558740	make good choices, this is super comfy, yay, thank you
2558740	2584740	I try my best to find the triggers every time there's an ASMR stream
2584740	2592740	can we get something in Russian too? depends, like what?
2615740	2622740	I would say that, but my parents hooked my thoughts
2622740	2632740	so how about I say that in the member stream? would that be okay?
2632740	2644740	I could say that in a member stream tomorrow, but I can still say I love you in Russian
2663740	2665740	I love you
2670740	2673740	I love you
2675740	2678740	very much
2679740	2693740	what do you mean discovered? they know
2693740	2702740	what do you mean oof? they support me, they're very sweet about it
2708740	2737740	so they approve of your misters, I mean I think they would prefer if I have one mister
2737740	2739740	but
2746740	2751740	hello Kevin, thank you for the membership, welcome
2751740	2767740	I can't, you always make me laugh, you're so funny
2767740	2787740	for 100 people turning up to your brand's house to ask permission to marry you
2788740	2797740	imagine, oh my god, my dad would be like, what the fuck, who are these people?
2802740	2808740	fucking kicks you down the fucking stairs, punches you
2817740	2826740	oh my god, now we'd win
2826740	2841740	my dad is super nice, he's really sweet, he's not much of a talker and he looks very serious but he's a good person
2847740	2858740	it's good to be an interesting family for you
2858740	2870740	I don't think that would be enough space for all of you to be honest, they live like in a really really small apartment
2878740	2884740	basement, they don't have a basement
2884740	2903740	can I just hang out on the porch with Bob up here while the other guy sits right there
2903740	2911740	I mean, I suppose if you get to talk to him then maybe your chance is higher
2911740	2918740	than if you spend it fighting with others
2918740	2928740	like if you drink a beer with him or something like that then he would enjoy that
2941740	2967740	I don't drink though, well, if you don't drink, I don't know how you're gonna bond with my dad to be honest
2971740	2978740	oh my god, pure and fraught, I fucking can't
2978740	2983740	rogue Robin, thank you so much for the membership, welcome in
2983740	2986740	can I live in the fridge?
2986740	2988740	no
2989740	2996740	I can take him to dinner and go fishing
2996740	3005740	fishing, he would love the heck out of that, my dad actually loves fishing
3005740	3011740	sometimes he goes on the weekends fishing with his friends
3011740	3017740	and then he comes back home and cooks the fish that he got for my mom
3017740	3024740	and it always makes her extremely happy, I think it's super sweet
3041740	3047740	ah
3071740	3081740	the real question is if Papa Bear is single, what the fuck, no
3081740	3089740	my parents are married for like 25 years, they are very much happily married
3089740	3097740	they're definitely not single, happily married for 25 years
3119740	3135740	no, there's no chance, shut up, I love my parents' relationship and their marriage
3136740	3151740	they're the only reason that I have hope that marriages can work and that you can be married for so long
3151740	3159740	and still show affection to each other and still do nice gestures for each other
3159740	3167740	you know, not to have this basically dead relationship just because you're married
3167740	3178740	so they're literally the reason that I still believe that it's possible to have a really good and healthy marriage
3179740	3194740	like, whenever it's her anniversary or her birthday, my dad always buys her either jewelry or some flowers and stuff like that
3194740	3203740	and you know, when he goes fishing, he really likes to cook the fish that he gets for her
3203740	3211740	and they love traveling as well, which is another thing that I think is super cute
3211740	3224740	at least once a year they go travel somewhere around the world and you know, enjoy their life to the best together and make memories
3224740	3242740	so, yeah, I really love the relationship that my parents have and they would be like the perfect example for, you know, a good, healthy and loving marriage
3243740	3249740	do they always travel together?
3249740	3252740	do they always travel together?
3252740	3254740	yes, always
3254740	3256740	yes, always
3256740	3273740	like, a couple of months ago, it was my dad's birthday
3274740	3282740	and my mom basically planned a trip to Austria with him
3282740	3293740	and I actually took a train to Austria so that I could see my dad and celebrate his birthday together with him
3294740	3296740	so, yeah
3297740	3300740	I love their relationship
3300740	3302740	their relationship
3303740	3305740	and I love them in general
3305740	3317740	they have always been very sweet and supportive of me, always loving and I really can't say enough good things about my mom and dad
3317740	3320740	both very amazing people
3324740	3327740	and my grandparents
3329740	3336740	my grandparents have been married for like 60 years
3337740	3342740	would have been longer if he didn't pass away
3344740	3348740	but basically they had like, you know, a really good relationship as well
3348740	3354740	and the way that they met is actually a crazy story
3354740	3365740	if you want, I'll tell you like, the crazy story about my grandma and grandpa got together
3365740	3372740	when my mom told me the story, it was like, holy shit, that's crazy
3378740	3389740	so basically, so back story, my grandpa was actually already engaged
3389740	3395740	and he was actually supposed to have a wedding and marry someone
3397740	3403740	and just one day, when he was at the train station
3404740	3411740	my grandma just casually walked out of that train
3411740	3419740	and he saw her and he just like, you know, like instantly knew that she's the one
3419740	3423740	like, he saw her and he knew that she's the one
3424740	3429740	and he ended up cancelling the wedding
3430740	3436740	and, you know, tried to get my grandma's attention
3436740	3440740	and, you know, get her and he did
3440740	3445740	and they've had a really amazing relationship
3445740	3450740	and they have been married for 60 years
3450740	3454740	freaking 60 years, you know
3454740	3466740	so, yeah, it's like, sometimes, sometimes, like, he just knew, you know, like, he saw her
