00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,040
I took a nap eldersday

195
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,040
awlair than yesterday

196
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,920
to make sure that

197
00:06:52,020 --> 00:07:01,940
that I'm not going to have any chance to wake up for stream

198
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:27,760
ဵျံ ဧေိဏဴအ. ပ

199
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,980
about them for me. I don't know. I guess I also get like really immersed in some of them so

200
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,420
so yeah, I hope you will enjoy watching me trying my best to become

201
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:52,260
the number one rock star. I'm also dumb. I got myself some tea and I was gonna drink it

202
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:59,380
while the loading screen was going, but I forgot. Hold on, I wanna see if it's still warm.

203
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,860
Oh no, I think it's kind of warm, but

204
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:19,380
it's warm. It's warm, but it's not as hot as I want it to be.

205
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,820
I also want to drink it, but I'm also scared if I drink it, I'm gonna have to

206
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,660
go to the bathroom a lot and I really don't want to have like

207
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,780
a bunch of rewrite backscreens while we're playing this, so I don't know what to do.

208
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,820
I don't want to see it, go do I see it, but I don't know.

209
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:55,860
But yeah, it's really good to see you everyone. Before I start, yesterday I

210
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:07,620
saw that some people donated to me while I was streaming, but the thing is, I didn't hear the

211
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:16,820
alerts go off, so I couldn't know, but also on top of that, I wouldn't even know who to thank,

212
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:26,980
because my so-called abomination of a setup is not gonna really let me see who did it,

213
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:35,620
so I thought that for now, so for now, I think that what I'm gonna do is

214
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:43,940
when there's donations, I will read them and thank the people at the end of the stream,

215
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:50,580
if that's okay, until I can get a better setup, I hope that's okay with you,

216
00:09:51,380 --> 00:10:00,340
because I still want to thank people, because I appreciate when people support me.

217
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:07,300
Here's a cute adjoin, a video where I watch a long video to be, oh really, it's not how you

218
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:18,740
found me, that's so cool, zip it slowly, yeah I could, but I don't know, I can already feel

219
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:27,780
I can already feel that I'm gonna have to go eventually,

220
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:37,380
and I don't want to deal with it, but yeah, I prefer them to be read at the end anyway,

221
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,380
and helps keep it flow, okay okay, that's good to know,

222
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:56,260
hello, just don't wheeze, I'll try, I'll try, no promises, no promises there, if I wheeze,

223
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:08,100
well at least I had a good laugh, you know, oh no, I shouldn't have told you about the wheezing

224
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:19,060
on my alt account, we'll try not to make too good of jokes, oh please do, I do love laughing,

225
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:27,860
I do love laughing, okay, let me open the game, and as usual, when I open the game, please let me know

226
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:38,980
if the sound is okay, and if you can hear me fine, and see everything, so yeah, I also try to figure

227
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:44,740
out if I can fix my mouth tracking a bit, because I feel like it's been like so so bad,

228
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:51,780
do you guys think it's any better, I don't think it's like better by that much, but

229
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:58,820
I feel like my mouth opens more, so I hope, I hope that's at least a little bit better,

230
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:10,340
that wheeze isn't really very contagious, I hear that a lot actually, that my laugh is very contagious,

231
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:20,020
I'm flattered, it's a bit, it's a bit, fuck I can't fucking read help, it's a bit better,

232
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:25,380
mouth opens wider now, yeah I feel like my mouth like opens more now, because usually like,

233
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:35,540
I talk and my mouth is like closed, or has my teeth out, I don't know how to fix it fully,

234
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:41,620
like I've tried like many different things, and it just doesn't, it just doesn't work,

235
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:50,820
I don't know if it's uh, because my mouth is small, like I remember talking about it

236
00:12:50,820 --> 00:13:00,260
with Strani, and she was like, maybe your mouth is just so small that the tracking just can't pick it up

237
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:14,340
or something, so I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what it is, uh, hold on, oh wait did I get another

310
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:48,660

00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:55,380
would you believe it, she took me to a whole different world, the music, the lights, everything was

312
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:02,180
so cool that I can't describe it with words, the expression on Lara's face as she played the guitar,

313
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:10,900
the dance of her fingers among the strings, oh I was in awe, one day I want to be like her,

feeling they get when they listen to me, real, I'll work hard to make my dream come true,

317
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:39,700

I can't flirt. I can't even fucking talk to you. I'm not even allowed to talk to my Snowberries. What the fuck is this about?

478
00:50:54,660 --> 00:51:03,660
Oh, my God. Okay, well, I'm hungry, so I'm gonna start eating my emotions. Yeah. Thank you.

479
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:14,660
Well, that was a good day. You know what? Okay, you know what? You know what? Fuck you. You can't urinate in here.

480
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:27,660
Oh, my God. Fuck off. Can I talk to you? No. Can I talk to anyone here? No. Please.

481
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:36,660
I just want to talk to my Snowberries. Lady, why are you standing here like a fucking statue? Please.

482
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:41,660
Hi, Oji-san. You would probably be interested, right?

483
00:51:45,660 --> 00:52:02,660
It's for being urinated in public. No, it's not. Yeah, fuck you. Fuck you for not letting me talk to my Snowberries. What the fuck?

484
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:16,660
On the bright side, only minus one popularity. I mean, at that point, I have zero popularity then because apparently I have negative fucking risk to the point that I can't even talk to you Snowberries.

485
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:23,660
So, yeah, that's fucking great. Press the K key and spin your first skill point.

486
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:29,660
Ooh.

487
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:33,660
I just need a breath.

488
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:40,660
Let's just chat with Snowberries. Fuck yes, I'm unlocking that.

489
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:49,660
Okay, wait. Can I do it now then? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Let's test it. Maybe now I can. Maybe now I can.

490
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:55,660
Okay, let's try again.

491
00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:01,660
Okay, now I'm actually allowed to talk.

492
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:09,660
Hello, Oji-san. I don't know who this is, but it doesn't matter, okay? This is about me.

493
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:24,660
This is about me. Ignore her. Ignore her. She will never. She is trashed here. I'm the one who matters here. Pay attention to me, okay?

494
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:31,660
Because fucking damn it. Let me stand. Okay, fuck you. Let me stand. Hello!

495
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:39,660
Fucking bitch. Okay, whatever. Okay, now I can finally talk to you Snowberry. Let's go.

496
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:44,660
Okay, what do you want?

497
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:52,660
What do you want?

498
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:00,660
I need your loving.

499
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:08,660
Snowberry. Fuck, I have zero reason. I don't know how to fucking flirt.

500
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:17,660
Well, my love's like a pub on Monday. None existed.

501
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:31,660
That's okay, because I can provide you that love wink.

502
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:47,660
Charmour, are you? My heart's like my wallet mate. Better when it's full, but Alice is always empty.

503
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:59,660
I'm sorry, Snowberry, but I have no idea what the fuck that means.

504
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:06,660
What the fuck? I heard it like in my fucking ear. Oh my god, that scared the shit out of me.

505
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:15,660
It's a high level technique called avoiding commitment by using metaphors, advanced stuff really.

506
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:22,660
Okay, and how did that work for you so far?

507
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:31,660
Look at Charm, unless I'm trying to find a job, then it's as effective as chocolate tea pot.

508
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:38,660
I'm not talking about jobs here.

509
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:46,660
What the fuck? Why did I get minus fifty dollars? What the fuck? I'm not talking about jobs here, okay?

510
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:56,660
Okay, I'm just gonna be straight forward. Let me suck here.

511
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:10,660
I'm gonna be straight forward. Let me suck you dick, baby.

512
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:23,660
Sorry, my dear, but the menu's not served at this spot. Try the fantasy section of the library.

513
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:34,660
What the fuck? How dare you reject me? I am number one whore.

514
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:53,660
Well, I prefer a more exclusive club. Membership, just me. Cheers to your ambition, Tom.

515
00:56:53,660 --> 00:57:08,660
I'm actually gonna open a membership, a membership eventually. Are you interested?

516
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:27,660
Membership for what? The number one whore club. Oh, pass, but thanks for the exclusive.

517
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:33,660
What the fuck?

518
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:39,660
Bro, what the fuck is this?

519
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:43,660
What the fuck?

520
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:48,660
Hold on, let me adjust my sitting position.

521
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:52,660
Oh my god, what the fuck, Rufus?

522
00:57:52,660 --> 00:58:00,660
What the fuck? I thought you're my fan. How could you? How could you do this to me? What the fuck?

523
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:11,660
You are totally missing out, my dude.

524
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:17,660
There is dick suck.

525
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:30,660
Well, that sounds like a niche market you've cornered.

526
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:37,660
Enjoy the echoes. Stick to my point. It's over.

527
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:52,660
It's over. He said I hate this shit. Zero res. Nobody is interested. Fuck my life.

528
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:58,660
He is a hater. He is a hater. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, Snow Berries, you know?

529
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:06,660
Sometimes there's gonna be haters and that's completely fine, you know?

530
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:13,660
Not everyone is gonna want to join my big membership club and that's totally fine.

531
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:17,660
You know why? Because I'm sure someone will love it.

532
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:24,660
Okay, okay, okay. It's gonna be okay. Just like he said. Okay, okay, okay.

533
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:32,660
Okay, where's my fucking car?

534
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:35,660
Is this my car?

535
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:41,660
Let's see. Instead of asking people out directly, how can they...

536
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:45,660
I'm a person who doesn't want to talk to them.

537
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,660
I mean, I already talked to them. Why do I need to ask them out?

538
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,660
Okay, well, whatever. Okay.

539
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:55,660
I'm gonna do it just to get this fucking thing.

540
00:59:55,660 --> 01:00:00,660
So, do you want to go out with me after our big talk?

541
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:03,660
No. Okay, bye.

542
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,660
Go home.

543
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,660
If you want, you can use the bus stop.

544
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:13,660
Why would I use the bus stops when I can literally just drive home?

545
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:15,660
Literally, why?

546
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:19,660
Please explain it to me.

547
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:33,660
I'll join your number one whore club. Oh my god, thank you. I appreciate it.

548
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:42,660
Thank you for supporting me, Snowberry. I promise you, you will have the best number one experience in my club.

549
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,660
The worst you can say is no.

550
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:51,660
And then there's Rufus just completely fucking obliterating me

551
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:58,660
and killing any confidence that I have left.

552
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:01,660
I can't put the fucking sounds in this game.

553
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:04,660
Okay, get out of my fucking way.

554
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,660
Get out of my way. I had a bad day, okay?

555
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,660
Okay, I had a bad day.

556
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:11,660
Leave me alone. Fuck all of you.

557
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,660
Home sweet home.

558
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:20,660
Open the melotify app on your phone and withdraw your welcome income.

559
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,660
Okay.

560
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:29,660
And withdraw your welcome income? What?

561
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:34,660
Huh?

562
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:38,660
Yeah, money.

563
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:42,660
Yes, Snow. Wow.

564
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,660
Thank you.

565
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,660
Give me fucking nothing.

566
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:50,660
Police department. Oh, great.

567
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:56,660
You received the traffic ticket because your car was walking traffic and car was fucked off.

568
01:01:56,660 --> 01:02:03,660
Please, please just let me just fucking sleep after this horrible day.

569
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:08,660
Press tab to say smartwatch at your end of the day start.

570
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:13,660
Well, fuck is...

571
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:18,660
I don't see a smartwatch.

572
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:22,660
Oh, that's what they mean. Never mind. I'm fucking stupid.

573
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:24,660
Being a rock star is so difficult.

574
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:28,660
I know. I can't even raise anyone.

575
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,660
What is the point?

576
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:36,660
Go to your bed and press the E key to sleep.

577
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:37,660
Okay.

578
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:40,660
Okay, good night, Snowberries. It's been...

579
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:42,660
What the fuck is my bad?

580
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:44,660
Wait, what?

581
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:48,660
Ew! Where's my bad?

582
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,660
Am I...

583
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:59,660
Oh, okay, I'm fucking stupid.

584
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:03,660
Okay, let's go sleep.

585
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:11,660
Wait, I didn't read what it said.

586
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,660
I didn't read what it said.

587
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:15,660
Fuck.

588
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:17,660
Okay, what do you want?

589
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,660
Who the fuck is this?

590
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:21,660
Hulkster.

591
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,660
Buddy.

592
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:25,660
I totally rocked the casino yesterday.

593
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:28,660
You gotta go try your luck for sure.

594
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,660
I don't know about that.

595
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:34,660
Fuck, I'm starving. I need to eat.

596
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:36,660
I need to eat.

597
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,660
Hello.

598
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,660
Can I have some food, please?

599
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:42,660
Thank you.

600
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,660
Oh, that was just a tutorial.

601
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:50,660
Yeah, a tutorial for getting roasted.

602
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:56,660
Fuck, excuse me for clearing my throat so much.

603
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,660
I would mute myself,

604
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:01,660
but my microphone doesn't have a mute button

605
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:04,660
and with my setup,

606
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:08,660
it's just full-screen the game, so...

607
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:11,660
Please bear with me. No pun intended.

608
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,660
Read.

609
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:18,660
What the fuck is this?

610
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:21,660
Wait!

611
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:24,660
Wait, this thing at the bottom!

612
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:30,660
Isn't that one of those sock artists?

613
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:34,660
Flark. Flork. Flark. Flark.

614
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,660
Art?

615
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,660
Are they allowed to do this?

616
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:42,660
Flork.

617
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:44,660
Yeah, that's what I meant.

618
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,660
Is that a flork art?

619
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,660
Are they allowed to use it?

620
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:52,660
I wonder if they're even allowed to use it.

621
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:58,660
Okay, let's read my diary out loud for you, snowberries.

622
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:01,660
I'm sharing this very important page with you

623
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,660
just because you're my snowberry,

624
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:07,660
so that's why I'm sharing with you my cringe fucking diary, okay?

625
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,660
Yo, yo, yo, buddy.

626
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:13,660
I'm so full of energy today.

627
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,660
I have tons of things to tell you.

628
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:18,660
First of all, my grandmother.

629
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:21,660
She's an amazing woman.

630
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:24,660
Thanks to her, I'm one step closer to my dreams.

631
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,660
No, I'm not.

632
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:30,660
My grandma sold her antique watch to buy me a guitar.

633
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,660
Can you believe it?

634
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:35,660
She sacrificed something so valuable for my dreams.

635
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:38,660
That watch was very precious to my grandma,

636
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:41,660
but she put my happiness above her own.

637
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:43,660
I can never thank her enough.

638
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:46,660
And here I am, on the streets,

639
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,660
pissing on people, making music with Riki.

640
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:53,660
Our shared passion for music brought us together.

641
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:56,660
Seeing the smiles on people's face,

642
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:59,660
watching their feet move to the rhythm

643
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:01,660
is an incredible feeling.

644
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:05,660
With our music, to bring joy to people's days,

645
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,660
to make them feel good,

646
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:09,660
even if for just a few moments,

647
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:11,660
it's indescribable.

648
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:14,660
I can't fucking read.

649
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:18,660
I'm working tirelessly every day to play my guitar better.

650
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:21,660
Each chord, each melody

651
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,660
brings me a little closer to my dream.

652
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:28,660
My admiration for Lara Croft is as fresh

653
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:31,660
as it was on the first day,

654
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:35,660
and she remains a great source of inspiration for me.

655
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:38,660
I don't know if I'll ever be as good as her,

656
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:41,660
but I'll never stop trying.

657
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:43,660
Life can be tough at times,

658
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:45,660
but with the happiness music gives me,

659
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:47,660
I can overcome anything.

660
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:50,660
And remember, Diary,

661
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:52,660
as I've always said,

662
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:55,660
I'm going to be a rock star.

663
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,660
Bro, what the fuck?

664
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:01,660
Okay, great.

665
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:03,660
Very nice, Diary.

666
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:05,660
Can I write a new song yet?

667
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,660
No.

668
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,660
Where is this?

669
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:16,660
And why the fuck has my door opened the entire time?

670
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:21,660
I don't think that's very safe.

671
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:23,660
Do I have anything in here?

672
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,660
Charlotte.

673
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:33,660
Wait, didn't this guy try to talk to me or something?

674
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,660
Unless I'm stupid.

675
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,660
Noah.

676
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:43,660
Hello.

677
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,660
I'm going to give you a very important piece of advice.

678
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,660
Listen carefully. Yes, yes.

679
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,660
Be the one who listens.

680
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,660
Don't you dare tell anyone.

681
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:00,660
You must have a lot of courage to make that move.

682
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,660
Yes, I do.

683
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,660
That's how I roll.

684
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,660
Despite all your efforts,

685
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:09,660
I don't think you'll ever become a real rock star.

686
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:11,660
Not that easy? Yes, it is.

687
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:15,660
You know what happens to dreamy punks like you around here?

688
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,660
No.

689
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:23,660
Why do I need to...

690
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,660
Where did you go to?

691
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:31,660
Ooh, there's a clothing store.

692
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:35,660
I'm kind of curious.

693
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:39,660
Kind of curious what they have at the store.

694
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:41,660
Let's see.

695
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:46,660
I wouldn't see if they have anything cute that I could buy, you know?

696
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:51,660
Because I mean, I've been looking like a homeless person this entire time, so...

697
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:55,660
I want to see if they have like a cute skirt or something cute.

698
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:01,660
Hello.

699
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:07,660
Okay, how do I...

700
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,660
How do I buy clothes?

701
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:12,660
Hello?

702
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:17,660
Okay.

703
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,660
Okay.

704
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,660
Do we have any skirts?

705
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:31,660
What is...

706
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:34,660
Okay, all these clothes are fucking shit.

707
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,660
This skirt is like...

708
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:41,660
This skirt is like the most...

709
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:44,660
Okay, out of all of them.

710
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:49,660
But none of them are like, wow, that's my style.

711
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:54,660
Okay, some heels.

712
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:58,660
And everything is like fucking 500.

713
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:03,660
Look at the glasses, I look so cool with them. Should I buy them?

714
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:06,660
Ooh, I might buy the glasses to look extra cool.

715
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,660
It also increases my charisma.

716
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:12,660
Okay, I should go to work then and save my money.

717
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,660
As much as I can anyways.

718
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:21,660
170 cents, that's broke.

719
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:26,660
Yes, that's why you need to give me money, Snowberry.

720
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:32,660
So I can finally look like not a fucking homeless person, okay?

721
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:38,660
Don't you understand the importance of fashion in the rock star music industry?

722
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:39,660
Come on.

723
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:40,660
Okay.

724
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,660
Oh fuck.

725
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:43,660
Why isn't...

726
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:44,660
What the fuck?

727
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:46,660
Why is it on this side?

728
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,660
Okay, a map.

729
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:54,660
Where is my...

730
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:02,660
Where is my fucking job place?

731
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,660
Uh...

732
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:10,660
That is not the center.

733
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:12,660
Oh, that's how you move the map.

734
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:15,660
Okay, I need to move it that way, guitar shop.

735
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:20,660
Okay, let's go to the guitar shop so I can make some more money.

736
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:26,660
Okay, get out of my way, lady.

737
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:29,660
Get out of my way.

738
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,660
Get out of my way.

739
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:35,660
Look at the map, look at...

740
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:42,660
Why does literally everyone have the same fucking car?

741
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,660
What's your problem?

742
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:57,660
I really wish this freaking game had music.

743
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:00,660
Like, how are you gonna drive in the car and not have music?

744
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,660
Something ...

745
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:18,660
Okay, I got the...

746
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:24,660
Fuck I'm stuck!

747
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:25,660
Please.

748
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:27,660
No.

749
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:29,660

Ok, let's do

780
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,360
mercy next

781
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,420
How big it is段

782
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:50,300
What?

783
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:55,180
Why is it showing as blue?, I am trying to make, it purple

784
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:58,460
Okay

785
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:03,320
They brought drop it in dirt. No, I think I think they dropped it in shit to be honest

786
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:08,700
Okay

787
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:15,100
Let's see. Oh, I know I know we can start with some scissors.

788
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:24,220
I mean to be fair that does not look like scissors

789
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,020
but

790
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:30,000
That looks like a fucking ribbon

791
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:36,760
Wow, that looks like shit. Well, I'm sorry, okay? I'm not I'm not a

792
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:43,580
Scaled artist like the rest of my gen mates, okay? I'm sorry, but but it's but it's the truth. I

793
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:50,060
I am I'm better at drawing ugly things that that's

794
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:53,580
That's my

795
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:59,580
My talent drawing ugly things, okay? And that's okay because that means that

796
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:02,780
It has more soul to it, right? So

797
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:05,340
So that's fine

798
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:10,380
Man, I really want to fix it all like fuck. This is bothering me. This is bothering me too much

799
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:15,180
It just it just looks so bad like I I can't

800
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:18,540
Okay, that's

801
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:20,700
A little better, I guess

802
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:25,820
I

803
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,700
Can't even make a stick figure

804
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:35,260
I I can I can you're skilled in other ways

805
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:40,060
God I wish you don't I I really wish I would

806
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:43,900
I really feel like I'm not skilled in anything

807
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:47,740
But if you ever find something that you think I'm skilled at

808
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:51,740
Please let me know that will that will make me very happy

809
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:55,980
Okay, so we have the scissors now

810
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,940
What else do we want to add

811
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:01,020
to mercy's

812
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:05,900
Thing oh, I know we can add some like blood like

813
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:11,660
Blood stains and stuff. Yeah, we can make it look like blood stains, I think

814
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:15,420
No, that's

815
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:17,660
I needed it to be a bit brighter

816
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,500
More like this I think

817
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,700
I

818
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,100
Wow

819
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:29,340
Wow, I can't even

820
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:31,740
Throw fucking blood properly

821
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:34,300
Okay

822
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,700
Wow, look at me go

823
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,500
That looks like

824
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,860
Like a fucking disease on a guitar. That's what it looks like

825
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:46,220
To be honest with you

826
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:50,780
But that's okay, I'm sure she will appreciate my effort

827
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:55,660
It's it's always about the intention, you know, I think it's always about the intention

828
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:59,420
That's what truly truly matters

829
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,300
She will be like wow, I see

830
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:07,020
Thank you for this ugly fucking guitar that you made for me. I love

831
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:10,380
Draw a heart, okay

832
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:12,460
True

833
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:17,180
Ooh, I can do like a broken heart because that's what her eyes are like

834
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:24,460
She had like a broken heart, okay, well

835
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:36,060
I just can't win I just can't fucking win it's fucking over

836
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:43,420
Okay, that's that's the closest that I can get to a broken heart

837
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,300
Heart I meant to say heart

838
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:48,860
eyepatch

839
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:57,580
It sounds so genuinely sad

840
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:03,500
I'm not I'm okay. I'm not sad. I'm I'm not sad. I promise

841
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:06,460
If I sound sad

842
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:08,700
I'm not

843
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:10,700
It's it's like it's like, you know

844
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:13,900
resting bitch face

845
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:16,700
For me, it's I guess resting

846
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,900
A sad voice

847
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,820
Or something I'm not sad. I'm okay. Stop it

848
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:30,860
I'm not sad. I don't know what you guys think. I'm sad. I'm not I'm having fun. Okay stop it

01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:40,460
An eyepatch

851
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:43,340

852
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:49,980
Wow, that looks like shit bro. What the fuck is

01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:54,700

01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:02,300

858
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:10,060
Wow

859
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:12,300
Beautiful

860
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:15,180
Okay, now let's clean the next guitar

861
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:20,140

862
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:23,020
I don't know about that

863
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:25,420
But thank you

864
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:28,140
Stabith

865
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,620
Oh, no

866
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:33,900
Not me having the joystick name originally

867
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:38,700
Joystick snow paws god damn

868
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:47,100
Now do yours no, I don't want to do mine yet. I want to first make sure I make

869
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:51,340
Guitar for each and every one of the girls and then

870
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:54,940
And then I'll make

871
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:57,020
One for myself

872
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:03,020
So many guitars are being dropped in the mod. I think they're being dropped in shit

873
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:09,100
Fuck

874
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,500
Okay, nice

875
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:15,340

01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:18,460
I see shawl

877
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,180
Yeah, why don't you don't even know what that means?

878
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:25,260
Uh, who who should we make the next guitar for?

879
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,620
Uh

880
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:45,420
I think I guess I'll make one for strongy

881
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:54,300
And then next time I do this job, I'll make one uh for azzer

882
01:21:56,860 --> 01:21:58,860
Fondle of both of

883
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:07,980
I already made one for shibi shibi's guitar has a toilet on it and ebony

884
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:14,780
You're good. Stop saying you sound sad. I'm not sad. What the fuck

885
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:20,780
God damn it stupid ogisan. I'm not sad. What is your problem?

886
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:28,460
Holy fuck ogisan. I think you're deaf. Okay. I'm not sad. What the fuck is your problem?

887
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:33,260
Okay, let's make one for strongy

888
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:42,780
I was trying to drive tentacle, but

889
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:47,340
I don't I don't know how I feel about this

890
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:53,820
What the fuck

891
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,900
The tentacles have dots on them

892
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:02,620
I can't remember what tentacles look like so pretend

893
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:06,540
Tentacles have weird circles on them

894
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:12,060
Tentacle looking guitar for strongy

895
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:15,740
Tentacle looking

896
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:18,780
Suction cups

897
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:22,460
Rings. Okay, so I have this. I also wanted to have something

898
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,220
A little bit pink to resemble

899
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:31,820
The kashies pink and green in her hair. What would be the pink?

900
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:39,740
Uh depends on the tentacle

901
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:42,620
Yeah

902
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:45,740
Oh, I think I know hold on. I think I know

903
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:56,620
Eyes no no no no not eyes. I was thinking of um she has like the cute seashells she has

904
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:04,380
Seashells on her hair

905
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:09,360
Nice that looks cute

906
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,440
Good

907
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:17,440
Halen Bieler has seen the most tentacles as a wonder. I mean probably strongy

908
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:25,760
She literally lives under the sea so I assume she sees tentacles every freaking day

909
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,600
I think that would make sense

910
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,200
Okay, well this one looks like fucking shit because I don't have enough

911
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:36,800
Space and I can't make the brush small enough

912
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,600
Under the sea

913
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:45,280
There are videos you can use for reference for reference for what to draw

914
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,960
No, I'm good

915
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:56,640
Trolley and artist of all time. Thank you. I'm glad you think so. What else could we add?

916
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,640
Write her name too. Okay

917
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:04,000
I don't know if I will have space. Where could I

918
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,320
Give me here

919
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,600
Strah

920
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,120
Knee

921
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,000
Nice and then also put a heart in here

922
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,640
Okay, nice. Okay, that's cute

923
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,880
Should we put a sticker? What stickers do we have?

924
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,960
I

925
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,520
Wish we had more stickers

926
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,040
They really don't

927
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:47,920
They really don't have a big variety. Um

928
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,320
Oh

929
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,320
How do I can I make the stickers

930
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,320
I

931
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:06,800
What the fuck am I doing? I want to make the stickers bigger, but I can't

932
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,760
Okay, whatever

933
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:14,260
I don't know how you put it in there

934
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:23,680
Just just just pretend it makes sense this this sticker here is supposed to uh resemble

935
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,640
Uh the fact that she is

936
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,600
Mine and my gen mates mommy

937
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:35,120
Okay, this sticker that that's what it resembles. It resembles mommy

938
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:44,480
Oh, there's another one. Okay, I didn't know I'm doing three today. Okay. I can make azeris then

939
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,840
You can make azeris as well then

940
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,560
This has literally become a fucking

941
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:57,680
Costume guitar make up make up. Fuck. I can't talk this has officially become

942
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,400
um

943
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:04,080
A fucking uh, we can't talk costume

944
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:09,760
Uh guitar maker simulator. That's what this game has become apparently for me

945
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,560
The best few minutes

946
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,960
Me

947
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,120
Fuck

948
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:38,720
Okay, nice. Okay. So uh next

949
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:44,000
We're going to be doing

950
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:46,240
We're going to be doing

951
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Acera

952
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:53,040
Okay, so I think

953
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,240
She be soggy at the guitar

954
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:03,280
Wait, really? Did she did you see it?

955
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,200
Really? What did you say? What did she say?

956
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,320
Oh, no, she's probably gonna kill me

957
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,040
Oh, no, she's probably gonna kill me

958
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,320
What did she say about my guitar? I want to know

959
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:26,560
You get spanked. I snitched. Yeah, she says you're getting a spanking. Oh, no

960
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,440
Not like this

01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,640
I'm sorry, she be

01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,440
I'm sorry, she be the toy

She add your twitter responding to it. Oh god, I see a sweater god you're getting spanked for this

965
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:56,560
Okay, I'm wondering though. I'm really wondering what's himi's reaction is gonna be when she sees hers

966
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:01,840
Because hers is the most fucking unhinged one that I've made

967
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,360
Like I made everyone

968
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,400

Oh

973
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:34,640
I know what I want to draw

974
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,520
Could you show the guitars again?

975
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,760
I can't you you'll have to watch the vod and go back

976
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:47,920
Uh to see all of them. There's no option to like see these guitars again or anything like that

977
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:54,240
Um, okay, I want to I want to draw a baby bottle. I want to draw a baby bottle

978
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,880
Let's start with a baby bottle. I think that would be good

979
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,120
Hmm

980
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,280

Okay, I know what this looks like right now

982
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,880
But please

01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:20,640
This is not the final result. Okay, this is this is not the final result. Trust the process

984
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,280
Trust the process, okay

985
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:27,680
Okay

986
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:31,200
Okay

987
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,280
No

01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:39,760
Leave it like that. No, I I don't want to get in trouble with acera as well. I'm good

989
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,240
I don't want to get in trouble with acera as well

990
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,960
Or imi because I don't know what what's going to be imi's reaction when she sees hers

991
01:30:50,960 --> 01:31:00,960
Hopefully she doesn't curse me with her magic book. Or like fucking kills me

992
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:05,520
Ah

993
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,800
Oh, that's not the same

Nice, look that looks cute, right?

996
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,000
I think that looks cute. We have like a milk thing

997
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:25,680
Because because she has uh the baby bottle in her oshi mark. So I think that's cute, right?

998
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:32,320
I like it. I think it's cute should I add uh one of those like lines that they have

999
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:36,880
That show like how much uh of the milk you have

1000
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,120
You

1001
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:48,080
Should put a brown gold but small that's the thing that's the smallest that I can make my

1002
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:54,080
Brush which kind of sucks if I could make it smaller. I could probably drive in better stuff

1003
01:31:55,600 --> 01:32:00,080
Yeah, but why you draw poop? What do you mean? I didn't draw poop. What are you talking about?

1004
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:04,240
This is a baby bottle and this is the thing you suckle on

1005
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:06,880
What the fuck has her in it?

1006
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,920
um

1007
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,920
Wait

1008
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,680
I went back to see imi's because I forgot hers is just

1009
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:21,200
Okay, so imi's imi's guitar has a big dunk, but

1010
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,800
It has a skeleton on top of it

1011
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,720
So

1012
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,720
Do you see what i'm saying?

1013
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:33,680
I don't even know what i'm saying, so don't pay attention

1014
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:41,840
It's a nipple. Yeah, yeah, it's like it's it's the baby bottle the nipple thing like uh you suck on on the baby bottle

1015
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:46,640
That that that's what it is

1016
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,440
Okay, what else should we draw?

1017
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:51,840
I want to draw a gold, but I don't know if I would be

1018
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,120
Able to really draw a gold because the brush is just not small enough

1019
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,920
uh

1020
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I'm not sure

1021
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:04,960
Like I would draw a gold otherwise cookies

1022
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:08,800
Just her horns

1023
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,360
I don't remember how to draw

1024
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:20,000
Draw the letters milf. Oh, that's a good one hold on

1025
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,720
Sorry about the noise outside if you can hear it

1026
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,560
Beep beep, okay, we're gonna put this

1027
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,920
I

1028
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,080
Milf

1029
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,600
Nice

1030
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:48,320
I don't have space to write all of that. Okay. I have very limited space, okay

1031
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,600
Maybe like blue in the white part

1032
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,520
Wait, what do you mean? What do you mean like?

1033
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,360
And then put a heart maybe

1034
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:09,840
Well, that's at least fucking hard I've ever seen

1035
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
What is my fucking problem?

1036
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:21,120
That's the problem with with with this the problem with this thing

1037
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:27,440
Is that because the brush is so fucking thick like I can't draw things as well as I usually would when I do

1038
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:29,680
Stuff with my mouse

1039
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,680
Below the strings thingy wait, what do you want me to put?

1040
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,920
Below the strings thingy

1041
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:49,360
Is cute do you think it's good enough or or are we missing or should we add something else?

1042
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,360
Small diamond

1043
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,400
Hmm

1044
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:07,520
Can I even draw a diamond that's not gonna look like complete fucking shit

1045
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,720
Fuck how do you draw a diamond I forgot I think like this

1046
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,520
Wow, that looks like shit

1047
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,360
Man, I hate the brush in this game

1048
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:34,880
Could you draw being conquerors? Sure, you know what let's do this

1049
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,880
There you go

1050
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:55,920
Why did I out of pee what the fuck I didn't even click to pee what the fuck

1051
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,600
What the fuck I didn't

1052
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:06,320
What oh fuck I'm starving as well. What the fuck happened

1053
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:13,280
I finished making the guitars and I instantly started pissing. What the fuck?

1054
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:18,400
I'm starving. I need to get food. What is happening?

1055
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:24,000
Pissing over the floor or like pissing simulator. Okay, real

1056
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,800
Oh my god, can my

1057
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:30,320
My stomach stop me in those rooms. Is it what the fuck?

1058
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:34,080
Okay, I need I need to go back home

1059
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,320
Need to desperately go home

1060
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:42,640
Yeah, what are those noises?

1061
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:51,040
See this is this is why I I don't want anyone to hear my tummy sounds and

1062
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:56,960
Bitch, please stop. Oh my god. I hate the sound. What the fuck?

1063
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:02,240
What the hell is this?

1064
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,400
Holy fuck

1065
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,560
What are those noises?

1066
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:10,720
What the fuck did you eat?

1067
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:15,360
All I ate is baby food and a banana before stream

1068
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,400
What the fuck?

1069
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:23,200
Are you okay?

1070
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:28,880
Uh, I will be when I become the number one star

1071
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,160
The fuck I had this fucking game

1072
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,160
Oh my god

1073
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:47,360
Those aren't the fun time you sound this smart. Yeah, no shit. Come on, please give me food

1074
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:54,000
The hell are you doing eating baby food? Um, I like to get

1075
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,280
pouches of

1076
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:03,760
Baby food because they're easy to eat for me and they're like a nice quick snack

1077
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:05,520
so

1078
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:12,000
Before a stream I I don't like to have a full meal. I like to eat my full dinner after stream

1079
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,080
so before a stream I always get

1080
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:18,960
A banana and like a pouch of baby food and that keeps me full

1081
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:22,640
While I stream

1082
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:29,040
I really I really like mango flavored ones. Those are the best

1083
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:34,560
What kind of baby food? Uh, it has banana mango

1084
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,760
And and gojava in it. I think

1085
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,800
Okay, let's do piss time

1086
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:50,960
You know, I should have pissed on someone outside, but I already have like minus one charisma, so

1087
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:54,080
I don't know if I want to ruin that

1088
01:38:55,280 --> 01:39:01,280
Doesn't look gross. I mean, I don't see it. It's it's in a pouch like you it's in a pouch

1089
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,920
And then you open it and then you like

1090
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:07,680
You know, like you suck it basically the food

1091
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,080
Why baby food

1092
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:18,720
Because it's it's just convenient. It's like it's in a pouch. It's fast. It's easy. I open it

1093
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:22,480
I I suck it up. It gives me full

1094
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:25,200
for the time that I stream and

1095
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:28,400
Yeah

1096
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,400
Convenient fast healthy

1097
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,840
Sweet and nice

1098
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:36,160
Good enough for me

1099
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:39,360
Why are so we do right behind the toilet?

1100
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,600
Um

1101
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:48,560
You know, you want to know why because when I stand here and I piss I like to look outside

1102
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:55,200
You know, like I really want to get a nice view while I pee that makes me really happy

1103
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:03,280
Why not astronaut food sounds way cooler? I don't know where I would get

1104
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:07,120
astronaut food to be honest. I don't know

1105
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:15,600
Uh, where's my bed is supposed to be here, right? I'm supposed to go to sleep, right? Can I make a new song yet or no?

1106
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:21,360
Wow, no, I fucking can't okay, whatever

1107
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,560
It's bad time

1108
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:28,080
Every time I open this

1109
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:32,000
I'm sorry. Okay. I have a small bladder

1110
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:35,200
I can't help it

1111
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,600
Okay, so what the fuck?

1112
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:49,040
Oh, I was supposed to go to the casino

1113
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:55,440
Right, let's go to the casino. I completely forgot about that

1114
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:58,080
Yeah, we should we should try it out

1115
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:01,040
We should try it out and see if we can get lucky

1116
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Stop staring at me

1117
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:06,240
Where's my car?

1118
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:08,240
Did they tow my car again?

1119
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:13,200
I think they did because I'm too lazy to park it anywhere

1120
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:28,080
Rufus took it. I'm gonna kill Rufus. How dare he reject me? Okay, let's see the map

1121
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,800
Uh

1122
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:34,160
Where is

1123
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:38,720
Uh park on strong car dealer

1124
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:45,760
Uh casino, okay nice. Okay, let's go

1125
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:54,880
Did they steal your car? I don't think so. I think I think they went to like tow it

1126
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:57,680
or something like that

1127
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,800
I want you to break up with him

1128
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:02,880
We weren't even in a relationship

1129
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
I got straight up rejected

1130
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:11,440
Rufus straight up fucking rejected me. Did you not see the conversation?

1131
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,560
Um

1132
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:46,160

02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:44,040
Sounds like a rockstar to me.

1535
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:52,040
That's a rockstar life. You go piss on people.

1536
02:09:52,040 --> 02:09:56,040
GAMBALL and make custom guitars for your friends.

1537
02:10:06,040 --> 02:10:08,040
Fuck, fuck.

1538
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:20,040
Since I'm here, I'm gonna exit the game.

1539
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:28,040
And I am gonna thank the people who have donated.

1540
02:10:28,040 --> 02:10:36,040
And then I'm gonna redirect you into Strani.

1541
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:40,040
Let me see.

1542
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:48,040
Let me see.

1543
02:10:48,040 --> 02:11:00,040
Let me add any top on my stream elements.

1544
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:02,040
Hold on, hold on, shall we?

1545
02:11:08,040 --> 02:11:12,040
I know, I know my chocolate stuff.

1546
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:30,040
Thank you for watching the stream.

1547
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:34,040
I know you're telling me thank you for the stream.

1548
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:40,040
But it's big thanks for your snowberries.

1549
02:11:40,040 --> 02:11:42,040
For being here.

1550
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:48,040
How do I view it in a bigger thing?

1551
02:11:52,040 --> 02:12:06,040
I'm gonna read the ones from yesterday and from today.

1552
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:08,040
Okay, so Mike Honey said.

1553
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:10,040
Russian honey.

1554
02:12:10,040 --> 02:12:12,040
Oh, bratty lolly baba.

1555
02:12:12,040 --> 02:12:14,040
It's correction.

1556
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:16,040
Oh, sorry for the cringe.

1557
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:18,040
It's fine.

1558
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:20,040
It's fine. Thank you so much.

1559
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:24,040
Thank you for the $6.9 tip, Mike Honey.

1560
02:12:24,040 --> 02:12:30,040
Anonymous, thank you for the $4.2 donation.

1561
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:34,040
Why didn't the polar bear bright turn up to her wedding?

1562
02:12:34,040 --> 02:12:36,040
She got cold feet.

1563
02:12:38,040 --> 02:12:44,040
I'm sorry, I don't get the joke on, but I appreciate the effort.

1564
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:54,040
Joshua, thank you for the $4.2 donation.

1565
02:12:54,040 --> 02:13:04,040
Thank you for the $10 donation.

1566
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:06,040
Why am I freezing?

1567
02:13:06,040 --> 02:13:08,040
What the fuck?

1568
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:10,040
This is shit.

1569
02:13:10,040 --> 02:13:12,040
We believe in UIC.

1570
02:13:12,040 --> 02:13:14,040
Thank you for believing in me.

1571
02:13:14,040 --> 02:13:16,040
I appreciate it.

1572
02:13:16,040 --> 02:13:22,040
Joshua, thank you for the $6.9 donation.

1573
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:30,040
Mike Honey, thank you for the $3.33 donation.

1574
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:34,040
Now watch Netflix with a polar bear.

1575
02:13:34,040 --> 02:13:38,040
They're always pressing pause.

1576
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:42,040
Okay, Mike Honey, okay.

1577
02:13:42,040 --> 02:13:44,040
Joshua, thank you for the donation.

1578
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:46,040
Thank you for the stream.

1579
02:13:46,040 --> 02:13:48,040
I keep up the good work.

1580
02:13:48,040 --> 02:13:50,040
Thank you, thank you for coming to my stream.

1581
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:52,040
I appreciate it.

1582
02:13:52,040 --> 02:13:58,040
And another donation from Joshua.

1583
02:13:58,040 --> 02:14:00,040
Thank you again.

1584
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:10,040
Namecatguy said cute brat.

1585
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:14,040
Thank you for the $4 donation.

1586
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:18,040
Joshua, thank you for the $6 donation.

1587
02:14:18,040 --> 02:14:28,040
Mike Honey, why do you call a polar bear who likes to sunbathe a solar bear?

1588
02:14:28,040 --> 02:14:32,040
Oh gee, son, you better get better jokes.

1589
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:34,040
Why are these jokes?

1590
02:14:34,040 --> 02:14:40,040
I'm not laughing, but thank you for the $3 donation.

1591
02:14:40,040 --> 02:14:46,040
Mike Honey, baby food equals true lolly.

1592
02:14:46,040 --> 02:14:52,040
Thank you Mike Honey for the $6 donation.

1593
02:14:52,040 --> 02:14:54,040
Oh my god, help.

1594
02:14:54,040 --> 02:14:56,040
I fucking can.

1595
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:58,040
But yeah, thank you.

1596
02:14:58,040 --> 02:15:00,040
Thank you for everyone who's dead.

1597
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:02,040
I can't fucking talk.

1598
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:06,040
Thank you to everyone who donated yesterday and in today's stream.

1599
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:10,040
I really, really appreciate it.

1600
02:15:10,040 --> 02:15:12,040
Oh wait.

1601
02:15:12,040 --> 02:15:14,040
Wait, there's another one.

1602
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:22,040
Oh, tuning in on my lunch hour is becoming a cozy part of my daily routine.

1603
02:15:22,040 --> 02:15:26,040
Oh, thank you for the $10 donation.

1604
02:15:26,040 --> 02:15:28,040
And thank you.

1605
02:15:28,040 --> 02:15:34,040
I'm very happy that I can be a cozy part of your daily routine.

1606
02:15:34,040 --> 02:15:40,040
Although I don't know how cozy I am to be honest with how chaotic I can get.

1607
02:15:40,040 --> 02:15:42,040
But thank you, I appreciate it.

1608
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:44,040
Okay, okay, okay.

1609
02:15:44,040 --> 02:15:52,040
So again, thank you very much for everyone who came to my stream today

1610
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:56,040
and talked to me and made me laugh and donated.

1611
02:15:56,040 --> 02:15:58,040
I really appreciate it.

1612
02:15:58,040 --> 02:16:03,040
I don't know why the fuck my tracking keeps fucking pausing.

1613
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:07,040
I think it's because my phone probably needs to be charged or something like that.

1614
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:09,040
I'm not sure what the problem is.

1615
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:14,040
But hopefully that didn't happen last stream.

1616
02:16:14,040 --> 02:16:16,040
I hope that didn't happen last stream.

1617
02:16:16,040 --> 02:16:18,040
I don't think it did.

1618
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:25,040
But before I go, let me make sure that I redirect.

1619
02:16:28,040 --> 02:16:30,040
I need to remember how to do it.

1620
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:37,040
We will be redirecting into Strani.

1621
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:45,040
I need to go into my settings to do that.

1622
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:49,040
So, please give me a moment.

1623
02:16:49,040 --> 02:17:03,040
Okay, redirect and Strani save.

1624
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:11,040
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

1625
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:13,040
Okay, okay.

1626
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:16,040
All right, I'm gonna finish.

1627
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:23,040
I am not streaming tomorrow, but I will be streaming on Thursday.

1628
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:27,040
So I will see you guys on Thursday again.

1629
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:32,040
I believe Thursday I'll be playing the polar bear game if I'm not wrong.

1630
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:37,040
And then Friday should be a summer and Saturday the DJ stream.

1631
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:39,040
So yeah, thank you.

1632
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:41,040
Thank you for stepping by.

1633
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:43,040
I love you.

1634
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:46,040
I love you and thank you for being here.

1635
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:48,040
And I'll see you next time.

1636
02:17:48,040 --> 02:17:50,040
Bye bye for now.

1637
02:17:50,040 --> 02:17:52,040
Bye.
