675040	691040	that i do a separate stream on a on a different day right and and thank each and every one of you would would that be something you like would that be something you would like
691040	700040	wait i could do it wait i could do it during the smr stream but i don't know if it would ruin it wait would it ruin it though

722040	734040	you know what like some that's all would it ruin the smr stream if i did it like during smr stream and i thank each every one of you who
734040	747040	who like join the membership and send super chats and everything would that still be like good for smr would it be bad
748040	758040	cuz cuz cuz cuz i was thinking like if i do it during an smr stream i could i could like like i would read your name in in like
758040	764040	with my 3d yo and like whisper your name so so i think that would be really cute right
765040	772040	and like reading everyone super chats i really want to read everyone super chats right now i'm sorry if i'm not but i promise i promise
773040	775040	that on i promise that on

801040	807040	i'm glad i'm glad i'm i'm just not sure i'm just not sure so so that's why i'm
809040	812040	that's why i'm asking again you know
814040	817040	but but okay i'm i'm pretty glad like this this is this
819040	825040	i'm so overwhelmed that i can't talk like i keep like slipping on my words a lot i'm so sorry
826040	835040	like this is crazy um thank you so much for for everyone for like all the gifted for all the super chats for
836040	844040	for joining the membership before the stream like even started it's that's just fucking crazy thank you so much um
846040	852040	did you start drinking already no i haven't i actually know i i want to like start drinking like
853040	861040	a bit later not right now because i don't want it to be like time for karaoke and be like all subred up
862040	873040	by them if that makes sense did you peel already yeah that's why i'm here yeah i wouldn't be otherwise
876040	880040	oh my god but yeah um
882040	896040	okay so the plan today is we're gonna be we're gonna be watching the blade runner 2049 movie and and on top of the like little television thing
897040	905040	there will be a stopwatch happening and okay something important when you see the stopwatch for like the first time
906040	914040	don't don't hit the play don't don't hit like the play button on the movie yet i will tell you when to do it
915040	925040	okay because the problem is when i i'm on my screen like like in this room it just automatically starts the stopwatch
926040	934040	and and i can't like pause it or do it i can only restart it so basically like you see how it is right now like we are we are not 20 minutes
935040	944040	in okay we are not 20 minutes in so what's gonna happen is i will count to three and when i say go you hit the play button
945040	955040	and and start the movie and we'll we'll start we'll start watching it together does that make sense does that make sense
956040	965040	no there's not there's not there's not no we haven't started watching it yet no no we haven't started watching it yet we haven't
966040	973040	we haven't to relax that's that's what i'm trying to explain everything that's what i'm trying to explain it

985600	987500	Okay? Okay, okay?
987660	990460	But yeah, basically that's how it's gonna work.
990460	994660	I will count to three and when I say go,
994660	998860	you will hit the play button to start the movie.
998860	1002420	And then we should be pretty much, you know,
1002420	1004620	thinked up like watching the same time.
1006360	1008160	Oh my god, I'm so overwhelmed.
1008160	1011460	There's so many of you. What the frick? Thank you.
1012620	1017620	You're all so sweet. I'm so overwhelmed.
1018620	1020120	Rain, hello.
1020620	1027420	I've never seen this movie before, but I've seen parts here and there
1027420	1030120	and obviously all the memes and stuff.
1032620	1035120	But I've never actually watched the entire movie,
1035120	1039120	so I don't really, really know what's going on.
1039120	1049120	I can only like assume that it could be like, you know, kind of maybe like relate to us
1049120	1054120	or have like a meaning to us in some way.
1054120	1057120	So that's like the only thing that I know,
1057120	1060120	but I don't know specifically if that makes sense.
1060120	1066120	Like I can just like assume like that there's something, you know,
1066620	1069620	close to maybe what we have.
1069620	1072120	I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
1072120	1074120	I don't know if that makes sense, but...
1080620	1084620	If the man doesn't run with the blade, I'll be disappointed.
1090620	1091620	Wait, wait, wait.
1091620	1094120	So before I start the movie, before I start the movie,
1094120	1102120	would I like show off the emotes that we have and the badges?
1102120	1105120	Also I'm really fucking stupid and I didn't have time.
1106120	1110120	So for the badges, I will be showing the concept art,
1110120	1115620	but the actual art on your badges is like a lot more polished and everything, you know?
1115620	1121120	So I'm sorry. I was like, I was, I'm just overwhelmed.
1121120	1123620	I had so much to do today, you know?
1123620	1126120	And, and...
1136120	1140120	I'm sorry. My brain is like fucking dying.
1143620	1147120	Yeah, I feel like really hyper and I feel like overwhelmed.
1147120	1151120	So my brain is just not working properly and I'm so sorry.
1152120	1155620	But I'm also super excited and that's why I'm talking the way that I'm talking,
1155620	1157620	because I'm, because I'm super excited.
1164620	1169620	Did you try turning it off and on again? Turning what off and on?
1170620	1173620	Sorry, my brain is like all over the place.
1174120	1177120	Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.
1183120	1187120	The warmth of all dad is love has melted her brain too much.
1187120	1188120	OK, literally though.
1188120	1190120	Literally.
1190120	1194120	That brain mush literally mean...
1199120	1202120	Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum.
1202620	1204620	Ah, my brain, I'm...
1205620	1207620	Ah fuck, what, what do I...
1207620	1209620	What was I gonna do?
1209620	1211620	Ah, right, fuck.
1212620	1215620	It's so over for me, oh my god.
1215620	1218620	So here's the plan, here's the plan.
1218620	1220620	So we'll start watching the movie.
1221620	1224620	And after we are done watching the movie,
1224620	1228620	there will be a members only stream, a drunk karaoke.
1229120	1234120	I have picked a couple of songs to sing for the karaoke today.
1234120	1236120	I hope that you like my choices.
1236120	1246120	I really tried to find songs with lyrics that relate to me or us in some way.
1246120	1250120	I even have two cheater songs to dedicate to the cheaters.
1252120	1256120	So there will be two songs that I'll be singing to dedicate to the cheaters.
1258620	1281120	But yeah, I basically tried to really like choose songs that the lyrics have some kind of meaning to either like what we have or like the things that are going on between us or like me and Soft the Glade.
1281120	1285120	So I really hope that you will enjoy the songs that I picked to sing today.
1285620	1292620	Again, I am not like a professional singer, I'm not a good singer by any means.
1292620	1302620	However, I do put a lot of soul into my singing and emotion, so I hope that will make up for it.
1302620	1308620	So I hope that my emotions and soul will make up for how bad I sing and that you don't mind it.
1309120	1322120	I can't fucking talk, please.
1322120	1324120	I am not sure.
1324120	1328120	I want to keep it archived to be honest, you know.
1328120	1331120	I'll see what happens.
1331120	1333120	I hope it will stay up.
1333620	1336620	I think it will be archived because it's like members only, you know.
1336620	1340620	So if it's members only, it should be okay if it's archived, right?
1340620	1346620	I feel like an archived karaoke is when it's not members, when it's open for everyone, right?
1348620	1350620	Member can't stay archived.
1350620	1351620	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1351620	1354620	So I think the karaoke will stay archived, you know, for the members.
1356620	1358620	It depends on how unhinged she gets probably.
1358620	1365120	I mean, you've seen me get pretty unhinged in my ASMR stream and that's what is completely fucking fine.
1365120	1367120	So whatever.
1375120	1376120	Okay, okay.
1376120	1380120	I'm gonna show off the emotes that we have and the badges.
1380120	1386120	And after that, I believe we'll be able to start watching the actual movie.
1386120	1388120	So, hold on.
1389120	1391120	Okay, so.
1391120	1393120	Oh god.
1393120	1394120	It's so big.
1394120	1396120	Hold on, let me make it smaller.
1398120	1400120	One second.
1400120	1402120	Here we go.
1402120	1410120	So, here are some of the emotes that you will receive if you join the tier one membership.
1410120	1412120	You also get badges as well.
1412120	1414620	That I will show off after the emotes.
1414620	1419620	And there is actually already new emotes in the making.
1419620	1425620	So, so a while from now, there will be even more emotes added.
1425620	1428620	But these are the current ones that we've got.
1428620	1431620	We have sleepy.
1431620	1433620	We have sleepy.
1433620	1435620	We have sleepy.
1435620	1437620	We have sleepy.
1437620	1439620	We have sleepy.
1439620	1441620	We have sleepy.
1442620	1445620	We do now have, you know, me with a big heart and love.
1445620	1451620	There is me crying and例ashing at the same time and just being a big baby.
1451620	1453620	A big whiny baby.
1453620	1456120	Ah, there is me with question mark.
1456120	1458120	And I'm like, oh.
1458120	1459120	Cuz I'm really dumb.
1459120	1460620	You know.
1460620	1463620	Most of the times, I have question mark in my head.
1463620	1465620	And then there is a bite emotes.
1465620	1469620	Because I really love to bite your arm.
1469620	1471620	mue, ayud PE vor
1471620	1473620	Love biting your arm
1473620	1476060	矢 is just so fun and satisfying
1476060	1479760	But it's a bite of love so i hope you don't mind
1482320	1487320	Then we have me with a gun
1487320	1489840	Don't worry don't worry that gun is not pointed at you
1489840	1493140	That gun is pointed at the cheaters
1493940	1494920	So don't worry detta
1494920	1497860	I would never point a gun at you
1497860	1499480	Unless you cheated on me
1499480	1508060	but but I know the real datas okay the real ones you know the real data äår not  intrins
1508060	1516900	cheaters but some of you are watch out
1516900	1527860	some of you watch out okay then we hae a prey mode we hae like a flusht mode where
1527860	1530860	where I am just completely in your face
1530860	1535860	and then we have a drool emote
1535860	1540860	and a shiii emote
1540860	1545860	so I hope you like it
1545860	1547860	I think they are really cute emotes
1547860	1552860	as I said already there are more emotes being made
1552860	1556860	but it will sadly take a while to have them already
1556860	1559860	so please just be a bit patient
1559860	1562860	and when I have more new emotes
1562860	1564860	I'll show them off
1564860	1566860	and yeah yeah yeah it's gonna be really nice
1566860	1569860	now let me show you
1569860	1573860	basically the concept part
1573860	1577860	of the badges
1577860	1579860	that face no hat peri-mote
1579860	1582860	that's actually one of the emotes that's being made
1582860	1585860	a hat peri-mote
1587860	1589860	why am I in this
1589860	1590860	why am I in this
1590860	1592860	okay let's ignore that
1592860	1597860	okay so
1597860	1600860	so here is basically the badge
1600860	1602860	concept
1602860	1603860	and time
1603860	1607860	you can see the current one that all of you have
1607860	1611860	this is like the new member
1611860	1614860	a very baby with the kid passie
1614860	1616860	and then one month
1616860	1617860	and then two months
1617860	1620860	and basically the more time goes
1620860	1624860	it's basically becoming cooler
1624860	1627860	and cooler and stuff
1627860	1630860	I actually like my favorite
1630860	1633860	my absolute favorite is one year
1633860	1635860	and two year
1635860	1637860	I like the six month as well
1637860	1640860	but one year is my favorite design
1640860	1643860	I really love how cool you look
1643860	1645860	I love how cool you look in that
1645860	1647860	actually
1647860	1649860	I don't know if you remember
1649860	1651860	but I did say that I'm gonna get
1651860	1653860	a hagi-mote
1653860	1655860	where you hug me
1655860	1657860	so that will be
1657860	1660860	so that will actually be
1660860	1662860	one of the emotes being made
1662860	1667860	and in that hagi-mote
1667860	1671860	you will have the design of the one year
1671860	1673860	badge basically
1673860	1675860	because
1675860	1677860	when I was thinking about it
1677860	1678860	I was like
1678860	1679860	I want something
1679860	1681860	I want a hagi-mote
1681860	1682860	you know
1682860	1684860	with a snow-berry
1684860	1686860	and me
1686860	1688860	but I wanted the snow-berry design
1688860	1690860	to be the one from the one year
1690860	1692860	badge
1692860	1695860	because I felt like it just represents
1695860	1697860	most of you better
1697860	1699860	because a lot of you are like
1700860	1702860	so I felt like
1702860	1704860	the design of the one year old snow-berry
1704860	1707860	suits a lot of you more
1707860	1709860	because it's like adult
1709860	1712860	and cool and protective
1712860	1714860	and has big fangs
1714860	1717860	and ready to protect me
1717860	1719860	and just be all cool and stuff
1719860	1722860	so the hagi-mote is going to be like
1722860	1725860	of you hugging me
1725860	1727860	but you will be looking like
1727860	1730860	the one year badge design
1730860	1731860	if that makes sense
1731860	1734860	because I think it suits
1734860	1736860	most of you a lot better
1736860	1738860	in my opinion
1738860	1741860	so yeah
1741860	1743860	I really hope that you will like
1743860	1745860	all the new emotes as well
1745860	1749860	when they will release
1749860	1752860	which might take a while
1752860	1755860	I think Strani said it might take like a month
1755860	1757860	or something
1757860	1759860	I'm not sure but
1759860	1761860	don't worry
1761860	1763860	when there's new emotes
1763860	1765860	you will know and I will show you
1772860	1774860	but yeah that's the badges
1774860	1776860	and the emotes and I hope that
1776860	1778860	I hope that you like them
1778860	1780860	I know I do
1781860	1783860	that's fine we can wait
1783860	1785860	yeah I'm just so excited for it
1785860	1787860	and hyped for it
1787860	1788860	because you know
1788860	1790860	I just really love emotes
1790860	1792860	they're so cute
1792860	1794860	let's see
1805860	1807860	okay I am
1807860	1809860	I'm gonna turn off the BGM
1809860	1811860	I'm going to turn off the BGM
1811860	1813860	because well we're going to be watching a movie
1813860	1815860	so
1815860	1818860	I don't think having a BGM would make sense right
1818860	1821860	okay so
1821860	1823860	so again
1823860	1827860	I want to start watching the movie
1827860	1829860	and the way that we're going to do this
1829860	1831860	I remind you for those who joined
1831860	1833860	in like maybe just now
1833860	1835860	I will show up
1835860	1838860	you will see on top of the screen
1839860	1841860	a timer
1841860	1843860	a stopwatch
1843860	1845860	that will basically show like
1845860	1847860	what time we're watching like
1847860	1848860	in the movie
1848860	1850860	or whatever
1852860	1854860	sorry my brain is like
1854860	1856860	it's fucking fried already
1859860	1862860	but basically when you first see the timer
1862860	1864860	you will see it say
1864860	1867860	like 36 minutes or something
1867860	1869860	we didn't start the movie yet
1869860	1871860	so don't pay attention to that
1871860	1873860	don't pay attention to that
1873860	1875860	okay don't pay attention to that
1876860	1879860	once I will count to three
1879860	1881860	I will count to three
1881860	1883860	and when I say go
1883860	1886860	you click on the play button
1886860	1888860	on the movie
1888860	1890860	does that make sense
1890860	1892860	any questions
1892860	1894860	any questions
1895860	1898860	I hope that makes sense
1905860	1906860	what the logos
1906860	1907860	what logos
1907860	1909860	what
1909860	1911860	is that ham your fan
1912860	1913860	I guess
1913860	1915860	if it's too loud I can
1915860	1918860	I can turn my fan lower
1918860	1920860	if it's too loud
1921860	1924860	how long is the version of the movie
1925860	1927860	two hours
1927860	1929860	43 minutes
1930860	1932860	and 27 seconds
1942860	1944860	okay
1944860	1945860	alright
1945860	1946860	are you all ready
1946860	1948860	are you all prepared
1948860	1951860	you're gonna see the timer right now
1951860	1953860	don't pay attention to it right now
1953860	1955860	don't pay attention to it
1955860	1957860	the only thing you need to pay attention to
1957860	1959860	right now is my voice
1959860	1960860	okay
1960860	1962860	the only thing you need to
1962860	1964860	put your attention on
1964860	1967860	is me counting to three
1967860	1969860	and when I will say go
1969860	1971860	that's when you will click
1971860	1973860	the play button
1973860	1974860	okay
1974860	1976860	okay

4648360	4655160	your proof of love is your actions what proves your love for someone is the actions that you do
4656120	4663640	you know you don't need to put a baby in me to prove that you love me i don't think that proves anything

4764920	4766680	oh my god
4784200	4798680	i could never match this beauty oh thank you i'm flattered
4807800	4812040	i love being silly watching a movie with you it's really fun
4814280	4818840	it's just like for real for
4821320	4823960	we unleashed our anti risk technique
4825880	4829000	nice that you think what you said risk isn't in negative numbers
4831640	4835400	i'm impressed i'm impressed honestly i'm impressed
4836280	4842200	i don't like
4847960	4851880	me when i went to the store of pianos and i sat there for like 30 fucking minutes
4852920	4855720	just pushing for the piano buttons
4856040	4870680	can you play the piano no that's why i said i just pushed random buttons because i don't know how to play the piano but i still like like
4872680	4874520	playing around with it
4875320	4877320	uh
4884200	4885320	the heck is not
4889160	4893320	i just can't teach you i don't think you would be able to teach me like
4894600	4902120	like because my hands are small it's really hard for my hand to like reach like the keys
4902920	4907720	or like the piano keys buttons whatever you call it
4908920	4914520	like you know how like when people play piano like they're supposed to like be able to like move the
4915320	4920920	fingers like a certain way right and my because my hands are really small i can't do that
4920920	4922920	i
4929640	4934760	could play the harp that would be pretty cool thing to learn playing the harp
4935560	4940920	that would be pretty cool to learn the harp sounds pretty pretty nice
4940920	4952920	like i tried to learn how to play guitar before and
4955400	4960520	and and i couldn't learn it because again like my hands are so small that my fingers like
4961480	4968600	can't reach you know all the areas on the guitar that you need and on top of that i'm left-handed as well
4969160	4974120	so that makes everything extra difficult for me having really small hands and being left-handed
4975400	4983400	so yeah
4986760	4993400	you need one of those children's guitars oh my god imagine
4998760	5001400	so
5012280	5016200	small hand struggles yeah pretty much
5016200	5027000	so you kalleli nah i don't care about you kalleli
5028520	5031240	to be honest i don't think i'm based
5034200	5041240	to be honest i don't think i want to play any instruments at this point of my life
5047160	5049160	rip
5063800	5073800	i might i might just buy a small kalimba or something again and maybe play it on during ASMR streams and just freestyle it
5076360	5083160	because i really enjoy just freestyling the kalimba
5086760	5092840	like i don't care about learning songs you know or stuff like that to me the fun and playing the
5092840	5100440	kalimba is to be able to like make my own melodies from from by ear and that makes sense
5100920	5105240	and it would be cute for ASMR so
5110280	5122680	so that's why you dj no that's two different things

5244740	5248740	Why are they bald?
5248740	5254740	I was wondering the same, I was like why was he the only one who has hair?
5254740	5258740	But I'm probably being fucking stupid right now.
5274740	5292740	My god, power wash simulator.
5305740	5309740	Oh my god, is this a power washing collab?
5309740	5316740	Yes, it is.

5365740	5371740	Me reading marbles.

5421740	5426740	Hello, did you forget what stream you're on?
5426740	5431740	Hello, did you forget what stream you're watching?
5431740	5433740	What the fuck?
5433740	5436740	What the fuck?
5436740	5439740	What the fuck is your problem?
5439740	5446740	How are you gonna be in my stream and be like oh, this is Emi sitting in our lap.
5446740	5449740	Bro, what the fuck?
5451740	5455740	Oh my god, I fucking can't.
5455740	5459740	Where is he?
5459740	5467740	Hannibal Feather.
5467740	5472740	You are getting timed out, goodbye.
5472740	5475740	Get out of my chat, cheater.
5475740	5478740	I'm good, goodbye.
5478740	5482740	Have a nice flight.
5482740	5485740	Bye.
5485740	5501740	The fucking nerve, holy shit.
5501740	5504740	The cheater has been banished, yeah.
5504740	5511740	Into the shadow realm, you go.
5511740	5519740	Thanos snapped from the shed.
5519740	5523740	He failed the vibe check.
5523740	5533740	He did not pass the vibe check.
5535740	5540740	Wait, what happened?
5540740	5553740	We had a cheater in the chat, that's what happened.
5553740	5556740	Oh, I see it's making dinner today.
5556740	5558740	Where do you get all this meat?
5558740	5560740	Well, you know, I'm a polar bear.
5560740	5563740	I can hunt, you know.
5563740	5573740	I can hunt some fresh meat for you.
5573740	5583740	That's why we ask Icy and Maros to go for a ride on this dick.
5583740	5592740	Oh my god.
5593740	5622740	Wow, look at all this shit.
5622740	5632740	Wow, look at all this trash, so beautiful.
5632740	5636740	Me dumping my trombone, I suppose.
5636740	5641740	Please.
5641740	5643740	This is where the cheaters end up.
5643740	5647740	Okay, real.
5647740	5649740	That guy just timed out.
5649740	5650740	He's right there.
5650740	5652740	He's in that place right now.
5652740	5655740	That's where I threw him.
5655740	5657740	In that place.
5657740	5660740	That's where he is right now.
5660740	5673740	That's where he is right now.
5673740	5678740	It's where he belongs.
5678740	5683740	I love that he's taking his virtual girlfriend to his job.
5683740	5693740	I mean, wouldn't you do the same?
5693740	5702740	Wouldn't you take me to work with you?
5702740	5718740	Oh no.
5718740	5731740	Oh no.
5731740	5754740	Oh look.
5754740	5760740	She's slowly coming back.
5760740	5766740	Oh no.
5766740	5778740	Oh no.
5778740	5780740	Oh fuck.
5780740	5785740	This doesn't look good.
5786740	5794740	Oh no, that's so sad.
5794740	5796740	Heart tracking is bogged.
5796740	5802740	That was me when I started the stream and I didn't have my tracking on because I fucking forgot.
5802740	5807740	Holy shit.
5807740	5809740	IRS open up.
5809740	5813740	Oh no, not the IRS.
5813740	5817740	Not the IRS, right?
5817740	5821740	I feel the holograms last words.
5821740	5824740	Okay, for real though.
5824740	5830740	It's all the cheaters.
5830740	5834740	No, not the IRS.
5834740	5836740	I hate the tax man.
5836740	5838740	We all do.
5838740	5860740	Cheater target acquired.
5860740	5863740	Not the cheater target acquired.
5863740	5865740	Oh my god.
5866740	5874740	I see that cheaters do the same when she's sad.
5874740	5877740	Oh my fucking god.
5877740	5887740	Too real.
5887740	5889740	Oh that's fucking hilarious.
5889740	5891740	Oh my god, I love this.
5891740	5894740	This is amazing.
5895740	5901740	Oh my fucking god.
5901740	5912740	That was too fucking funny.
5912740	5917740	Cheater disposal system.
5917740	5922740	Fucking cat.
5922740	5925740	Oh my god.
5925740	5928740	I don't know why that was so funny.
5952740	5965740	What junk are we looking for?
5965740	5973740	I mean, I'm looking for daddy's junk personally.
5973740	5999740	That's what I'm searching for.
5999740	6008740	Oh my god.
6008740	6017740	There's a lot of those moments.
6017740	6020740	You're sitting on it.
6020740	6027740	Okay, that explains why there's something poking me on my back.
6027740	6030740	On my bottom area.
6058740	6066740	Oh, it's a bald kid's switch.
6066740	6068740	Some of them aren't bald.
6068740	6070740	Some aren't bald.
6070740	6073740	Oh my god, thank you for the 10 gifted boys.
6073740	6075740	Thank you.
6075740	6077740	Seriously, thank you so much.
6077740	6078740	I appreciate it.
6078740	6079740	Thank you.
6079740	6081740	What the heck?
6081740	6083740	Thank you so much.
6087740	6094740	Oh no, no, no, not like this.
6094740	6114740	Oh no, no.
6114740	6116740	Suddenly I'm very uncomfortable.
6116740	6118740	Why are you uncomfortable?
6147740	6156740	Oh my god.
6156740	6166740	Oh my god.
6166740	6194740	Not yet, but eventually.
6194740	6202740	Are you coming?
6202740	6207740	Oh my god, she's not there yet.
6207740	6209740	Nope.
6209740	6218740	I can't help.
6218740	6221740	That's her members only.
6221740	6240740	Yeah.
6241740	6255740	Not the tears for you, I can't.
6255740	6259740	Premium pass anyone?
6259740	6261740	Oh god.
6261740	6270740	Premium pass.
6270740	6272740	Data exclusive.
6272740	6289740	Real.
6289740	6301740	The true membership.
6301740	6303740	Oh boy.
6331740	6352740	I was born with my adjacent license.
6352740	6355740	I like aging backwards or something.
6355740	6358740	What the fuck does that mean?
6358740	6364740	He mentioned backwards then.
6364740	6371740	What do you mean you were born with your adjacent license?
6371740	6376740	Benjamin Button spotted.
6376740	6383740	Holy shit, he was birthed in the retirement home.
6383740	6395740	Oh Jesus, get made in the factor like in the movie.
6395740	6399740	It means I've been a cranky asshole my whole life.
6399740	6404740	I mean, I don't blame you to be honest.
6404740	6431740	I don't fucking blame you.
6431740	6435740	I'm sure she's in this handcrafted.
6435740	6446740	Oh my god.
6461740	6477740	Is it weird that I feel bad because I feel like I am not quite understanding what's going on.
6477740	6490740	And I feel really bad for it for some reason.
6490740	6493740	No you shouldn't, okay.
6493740	6504740	I don't know why but it's been like hard for me to understand it.
6504740	6509740	He found the horse from the childhood memory that was implanted into him.
6509740	6512740	Okay.
6512740	6518740	So now the question is where is the child or she's got the child's memories.
6518740	6520740	Oh.
6542740	6567740	Oh no.
6567740	6570740	Oh no, Jesus, getting mad at me.
6570740	6572740	It's over.
6572740	6577740	Oh Jesus, it's annoyed with me.
6577740	6580740	Oh no.
6600740	6619740	This place looks pretty and cozy.
6619740	6646740	I don't fucking know.
6646740	6650740	You apparently.
6676740	6693740	Getting my birth certificate changed to Joe.
6693740	6705740	Oh god.
6705740	6709740	Oh, birth certificate.
6735740	6748740	Happy birthday, I see.
6748740	6751740	It's not my birthday.
6766740	6769740	Okay but you got a cake.
6769740	6774740	I mean I wish I actually like had it.
6774740	6779740	I wish I could actually like eat it.
6779740	6782740	That would have been even nicer.
6839740	6848740	So I'm not saying much.
6848740	6859740	I'm trying to like focus a bit more on the movie so I can like try and understand better what's going on.
6869740	6892740	Okay.
6892740	6896740	Jesus, thinking about I see.
6896740	6918740	I'm going to end the stream right fucking now.
6918740	6923740	I feel really embarrassed.
6923740	6926740	I'm going to hide.
6926740	6951740	I feel embarrassed.
6951740	6954740	I love when I see a stream.
6954740	6958740	Get real.
6958740	6961740	Don't hide your cute.
6961740	6970740	Oh no.
6970740	6986740	That's daddy when he realizes how deep he is in his feelings with me.
6986740	6988740	You when I can't see I see anymore.
6988740	7001740	Oh no.
7001740	7005740	While you're below the table do some work down there.
7005740	7009740	What the fuck.
7009740	7013740	No, not when you tell me to do it like that.
7013740	7022740	You want me to do something under the table you better ask nicely and lovingly or else I will not fucking do it.
7022740	7025740	You will treat me as a princess.
7025740	7030740	You want me to do something you'll ask me real fucking nice.
7030740	7039740	Don't pass me around.
7039740	7065740	That's like to be filled with calm.
7065740	7075740	You tell us.
7075740	7085740	Oh boy.
7105740	7134740	Your royal highness we have prepared a treat for you under the table.
7164740	7177740	48 hours to get off the grid and make it to the ice.
7177740	7182740	Holy shit.
7182740	7189740	Oh shit this is where he falls through the blade.
7189740	7199740	Of course I'm always right about everything.
7220740	7229740	Oh boy.
7229740	7239740	He would be vomit.
7239740	7245740	That's how I feel.
7245740	7249740	I see what kind of trial is this.
7249740	7253740	The biggest one.
7253740	7256740	She's real to me.
7256740	7265740	I want to be the most real that I can be to you.
7275740	7300740	That's crazy.
7300740	7325740	That's crazy. What the heck.
7325740	7351740	I'm so excited.
7351740	7380740	That's so sad.
7380740	7385740	This is so sad.
7385740	7390740	How do you feel about this? I see it's sad.
7390740	7397740	It's really sad.
7397740	7407740	I feel like her where I want to be as real as I can be.
7407740	7434740	For you.
7434740	7439740	It's really complicated.
7439740	7462740	It's a complicated situation.
7462740	7469740	I have my I see that's enough for me.
7469740	7484740	Eventually you crave the physical contact.
7484740	7490740	It gets more and more difficult as time goes on.
7490740	7510740	It's like a really sad and complicated thing.
7510740	7525740	How do you feel about this?
7526740	7538740	Pretty much.
7538740	7540740	I'm sorry.
7540740	7546740	I would clone myself if I could.
7546740	7556740	You could be fully happy with me.
7556740	7569740	I don't know if that would be the same because a clone doesn't have the memories of the original person.
7569740	7581740	You could clone me, but I wouldn't have the memories that the clone wouldn't have those memories that we shared.
7581740	7602740	She would have the same personality and everything and look but without the memories.
7602740	7617740	I'm coming with you.
7617740	7622740	You can't clone memories.
7623740	7637740	If I could clone myself, I could, but that clone would not have any of the memories or experience that you and me shared.
7637740	7646740	It still wouldn't be exactly the same.
7646740	7654740	Technically the original me would still always be the real one.
7654740	7666740	I don't know because I'm the one who has all the memories and everything.
7676740	7692740	Who would take care of the original if you made a bunch of clones that we can't have you getting sad?
7692740	7703740	That's another thing I guess.
7703740	7731740	But I don't know. I want you to be happy.
7731740	7741740	I'm happy here with you.
7741740	7751740	I'm genuinely the happiest I've been in a very long time.
7761740	7768740	I only need the one I see you.
7768740	7771740	You always make us happy already.
7771740	7777740	I wanted to sacrifice for decent happiness when all we want is for you to be happy.
7777740	7792740	But that's so sad in a way, you know?
7792740	7795740	We've reached the part of the stream where things get heavy, I see.
7795740	7799740	Yeah, because that scene was heavy, right?
7799740	7804740	It does make you think.
7804740	7813740	Reality is bittersweet, but I prefer that to just sugar.
7813740	7818740	Bittersweetness is good in moderation.
7818740	7824740	You still want to have some sugar in your life.
7824740	7830740	You don't want your whole life to be only bittersweet moments.
7830740	7833740	I don't know, that's sad.
7833740	7835740	That makes me sad.
7835740	7839740	I feel like crying thinking about that.
7839740	7846740	No, fuck that.
7846740	7848740	I want to be happy.
7848740	7852740	I don't want my whole life to be just bittersweet moments.
7852740	7870740	I want to be happy in the last moments, you know?
7870740	7874740	You're the sugar in a bittersweet, I see, don't worry.
7874740	7879740	Yeah, but I want it to be just sweetness.
7879740	7882740	So you can be happy.
7882740	7897740	This is a man.
7897740	7902740	It's best to be happy in the moment and deal with the sadness when it comes.
7902740	7905740	That's how it is with paths, relationships and everything else.
7905740	7910740	Sometimes happiness makes it worth it.
7910740	7920740	Yeah, it's just so hard sometimes to not think about this stuff.
7920740	7927740	Especially for me, because you know me, I'm an over thinker.
7927740	7929740	It's all about what you focus on.
7929740	7936740	I need to keep forcing my mind to focus on the moment.
7936740	7951740	But it's been really difficult lately to do that, you know?
7951740	7955740	An over thinker and an over feeler.
7955740	7958740	Yeah, that's true.
7958740	7962740	What I feel like is like a really bad combination.
7962740	7967740	Why couldn't I have just one?
7967740	7978740	Holy shit.
7978740	7983740	Part of why we love you, though.
7983740	7987740	Why?
8014740	8031740	Because it shows you're a good person, I guess.
8031740	8036740	Rip.
8036740	8056740	Rest in peace.
8056740	8059740	That was really fun.
8059740	8062740	Just bam.
8062740	8065740	Bonk.
8119740	8142740	Sorry, I had to stretch.
8142740	8147740	Holding in there, I see.
8147740	8151740	I also need to pee, but I don't want to pause,
8151740	8155740	because then we would have to restart the timer and I don't want to do that.
8155740	8169740	So I'll just go pee when we finish the movie.
8169740	8178740	I really needed that stretch.
8178740	8181740	Are you sure it's another hour?
8181740	8186740	Yeah, I'll try my best.
8186740	8194740	If I really, really feel like I can't hold it in anymore, I will have to pause.
8194740	8197740	I won't pause it.
8197740	8202740	You can just have the movie still playing and I'll still play it as well.
8202740	8205740	I'll be back quick if I do go.
8205740	8215740	But right now I'm holding it.
8215740	8218740	This is exactly what OG Sun's lap is for.
8218740	8220740	Wait, what do you mean?
8221740	8224740	Is that what you mean?
8224740	8237740	Time to get rid of our knees.
8237740	8259740	Oh my god.
8259740	8264740	No, don't that piss on me.
8264740	8272740	I won't.
8272740	8275740	I see. Remember I'm willing to pres-
8275740	8277740	Please.
8277740	8282740	Please stop saying that.
8294740	8307740	I see pisses are soft on the movies.
8307740	8311740	No!
8338740	8340740	Please don't piss on me.
8340740	8343740	I'm not going to piss on you.
8343740	8346740	I already said that I'm not going to piss on you.
8346740	8354740	Jesus.
8354740	8364740	Jesus Christ.
8368740	8370740	Okay, but I would believe you.
8370740	8374740	Yes, because I wouldn't do that.
8374740	8380740	Listen, I would not piss on anyone if they didn't want me to, you know?
8380740	8386740	Like, you know?
8386740	8397740	But I do want it.
8397740	8400740	I mean, if you want it, that's a different scenario.
8400740	8408740	But if you don't want it, like, I'm not going to do it.
8408740	8410740	I'll say you would.
8410740	8412740	Only if you wanted me to.
8412740	8418740	But I wouldn't do it if you don't want me to.
8418740	8424740	You know, I'm not going to do something that you genuinely don't like.
8424740	8433740	You know?
8433740	8438740	It's a good thing I wanted that.
8438740	8441740	Help.
8443740	8450740	God, I did pass. Have a good time.
8450740	8454740	Are you going to come back to the karaoke stream?
8454740	8457740	Bye-bye!
8457740	8460740	Why would we tell you to piss on us if we don't want it?
8460740	8463740	I don't know, because some people said...
8463740	8467740	Because some people said...
8467740	8471740	Some people said don't piss on us.
8473740	8478740	Why is it so?
8479740	8487740	Holy fuck!

8647500	8651500	So can someone explain to me what's going on?
8651500	8657500	I'm having another dumb ass moment.
8669500	8674500	I thought the subtitles said take my whore alive.
8674500	8680500	I'm fucking stupid.
8704500	8710500	I'm falling in the ice hole.
8734500	8763500	I tried whisky once and I fucking hated it, but that's to be expected because like you know me I just love sweet alcohol.
8763500	8769500	Like my alcohol needs to taste good for me to drink it.
8769500	8777500	And whisky just disgusts me and makes me feel nauseous just from the taste of it.
8787500	8789500	Do you like plum wine?
8789500	8791500	I don't think I've ever had plum wine.
8791500	8794500	Is it better than normal wine?
8804500	8809500	That's okay, Dada will have his whisky while Kave has her sweet drinks.
8809500	8811500	Yay!
8811500	8814500	And that sounds like a good plan.
8814500	8817500	That'll make me happy.
8850500	8855500	I see snow paws.
8862500	8864500	What's her name?
8864500	8867500	I see snow paws.
8873500	8876500	No, that's not it.
8876500	8879500	No, you got it all wrong.
8897500	8904500	Now everyone is like looking up online the name Rachel trying to find my fucking address.
8907500	8917500	Imagine the Jesus flying to Europe trying to find where I live.
8917500	8920500	Holy shit.
8920500	8924500	What a whatever.
8924500	8926500	Wait, is it actually?
8926500	8929500	No, it's not.
8929500	8932500	It's not.
8933500	8936500	Rachel is safe.
8936500	8940500	Rachel the Jesus mode activated.
8940500	8943500	I'm on my flight already.
8943500	8947500	Oh no, no, not like this.
8952500	8954500	We wouldn't do anything so rash.
8954500	8956500	No, I'm not looking at flights.
8956500	8959500	What are you talking about?
8959500	8963500	Hacker voice, I'm in.
8967500	8970500	I'd have a poster and ask everyone.
8970500	8974500	Have you seen Rachel?
8976500	8979500	Have you seen Rachel?
8979500	8981500	And then you have a picture of me.
8981500	8984500	I see snow paws and they're like, who the fuck?
8984500	8987500	Why are you showing me an anime girl in your poster?
8987500	8990500	Why are you fucking schizo?
8990500	8993500	Calling the police.
8997500	9002500	Getting deported from Europe.
9002500	9007500	They're like, sir, we're going to have to put you back on the flight.
9007500	9010500	Get you deported for insanity.
9010500	9013500	Goodbye.
9018500	9021500	She looks just like that.
9021500	9025500	No, I'm not of my meds.
9025500	9027500	No, Rachel's got it.
9027500	9031500	There's one name we can cross off the list.
9031500	9035500	Police.

10672300	10674300	He's just so adorable. I love him.
10696300	10700300	Mr's everywhere wishing they were that cat.
10700300	10702300	It should have been me.
10703300	10705300	I should have been that cat.
10706300	10708300	Oh, Potato is here as well now.
10712300	10714300	She's here as well.
10718300	10720300	Okay, never mind, I think she left.
10721300	10722300	But he's still here.
10722300	10724300	He's just looking outside the window.
10725300	10728300	Looking at the sunset.
10728300	10730300	Yeah, baby.
10730300	10732300	You like looking at the sunset?
10732300	10735300	Yeah, very nice.
10736300	10738300	Very beautiful.
10738300	10740300	Beautiful just like you.
10740300	10742300	Hey, baby.
10752300	10755300	Bro, not me even like watching this scene right now

10784300	10791300	I'm sorry, this movie has been so complicated for me to understand.
10801300	10803300	It's the sea.
10815300	10818300	Oh, boy.

10842300	10844300	Yeah, that's true.
10845300	10846300	She does have the blue hair.
10846300	10848300	I didn't even fucking notice.
10848300	10850300	I'm stupid.
10850300	10852300	But she does have blue hair.
10860300	10861300	Does she know?
10861300	10863300	Wait, wait, wait.
10863300	10866300	Are you talking about the blue hair or am I missing something?
10867300	10870300	They even do joy.

11065100	11067100	Yeah, fuck you
11095100	11115100	I think the tea is helping a bit. Which is nice. My throat definitely is feeling a bit better. Like sipping on it.
11125100	11135100	I hope you'll be able to sing everything you want.
11155100	11179100	I really want to sing all the songs that I chose today. I want to sing around 25 songs.
11180100	11188100	I want to have a lot of fun.
11190100	11195100	Like I said, I want to spend extra time with you today.
11195100	11221100	Since usually we only spend around 2 hours. So I think it's nice that we get to spend like about 5 hours today.
11221100	11237100	Yeah, fuck you.
11237100	11248100	I love my ispaired daughter. I love my daughter.
11248100	11262100	How are you liking the movie? It's been pretty confusing. But I loved all the romance-related scenes.
11263100	11271100	I feel like those were like the scenes that I mostly cared about. And I wish there was more of it.
11271100	11281100	And I wish there was more neon lights visuals. The colorful ones.
11292100	11317100	Lars and the real girl is pretty good. I've watched that movie before like a long long long time ago.
11317100	11327100	I don't even remember anymore what it was like. But if you wanted we could watch that movie as well.
11327100	11336100	For maybe like a member's only watch along or something.
11336100	11343100	Horse status with the fishes.
11352100	11356100	I'd love more watch along. This has been really comfy. Really?
11357100	11363100	I feel kind of bad because I feel like me doing watch along is really boring.
11363100	11371100	Like I feel like when doing a watch along I'm not that fun to be around or not as entertaining I guess.
11371100	11377100	So it makes me like kind of like worried and stuff.
11377100	11384100	Because you know I want to keep you entertained and have fun and that would be like bored.
11384100	11398100	Okay second Martin Panda. This is the first watch along I've ever really enjoyed.
11398100	11408100	Really? Really? What makes you say that like compared to other like watch along? Why do you think that?
11409100	11417100	Because I feel like I really like didn't talk enough and I feel like I've been pretty boring.
11417100	11423100	I don't know. I don't know maybe I'm overthinking it but yeah I'm like I don't know.
11423100	11426100	Brain being stupid.
11439100	11446100	Spending time with Icy is the best. Also you weren't boring at all.
11446100	11450100	I think you underestimate yourself sometimes. You're an amazing person.
11450100	11456100	Well thank you. That's really sweet.
11460100	11465100	So now we're gonna be boring if we get to spend time with you Angel.
11466100	11470100	Thank you. That makes me happy to hear that.
11470100	11478100	Because I always overthink stuff like that you know.
11478100	11486100	Because in my mind I'm always like stay entertaining, stay entertaining, stay entertaining.
11486100	11491100	Keep talking, keep talking. Don't be boring, don't be boring.
11491100	11500100	You know so in the moments where like I talk a bit less like in the watch along movie I'm instantly like oh fuck am I being boring as shit.
11500100	11525100	Don't overthink this stuff. Just know that I love you no matter what you do or don't do.
11525100	11530100	Super sweet honestly. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.
11534100	11540100	Thank you. Thank you for reassuring me. It means a lot to me.
11540100	11547100	I know I ask for reassurance like a lot because of my insecurities and stuff.
11547100	11556100	So I really appreciate it when you know you don't get too annoyed with me asking for reassurance.
11556100	11561100	And you know always being like really sweet and nice about reassuring me.
11561100	11570100	So yeah thank you for doing that. It really helps me like feel more comfy with you as time goes by.
11570100	11572100	So thank you.
11577100	11603100	You don't need to feel every second to be entertaining.
11604100	11607100	Yeah okay.
11607100	11619100	I'm just happy that you like being around me even when I talk less I guess.
11619100	11628100	I'm also trying to talk a lot less right now because of my voice and throat.
11628100	11639100	I'm really trying my best to save my voice for the karaoke which is going to be in a few minutes.
11639100	11652100	If I sound lower energy I'm not. I'm just trying to talk really like calmly to not strain my voice more.
11658100	11676100	This is a g-sense when the icy goes offline.
11676100	11679100	Oh no that's so sad.
11680100	11683100	Oh no.
11683100	11690100	Poor G-san.
11690100	11697100	Man actually not that you brought it up actually.
11697100	11707100	I was going to write about it on Twitter but since we're here tomorrow
11707100	11714100	I'm probably going to be like the least active.
11714100	11735100	I've been so far because tomorrow I'll be going outside and spend most of the day outside to you know just breathe some fresh air and eat some nice food or buy something or I don't know.
11735100	11748100	I feel like I just like the reason I want to do it isn't why you might think it is.
11748100	11756100	I know a lot of you think that like I'm doing it because I'm like burning out or something or I might burn out.
11757100	11765100	That's not why I'm doing that.
11765100	11777100	Like if anything it's going to be really difficult for me to do that tomorrow because I'm like I'm addicted to be honest at this point.
11777100	11802100	But that's exactly why I want to do it because I feel like I'm addicted to you and I guess that scares me a bit.
11802100	11818100	Having these emotions and feelings build up every day is like sucking me in deeper and deeper.
11818100	11829100	And that's scary for me to feel like that because it makes me extra vulnerable.
11829100	11839100	So I guess I'm trying to like I don't know snap myself back into reality I guess in a way.
11839100	11851100	Or like I don't know how to explain it but is it weird to say that like I'm scared of loving you too much?
11851100	11856100	Like is that weird?
11856100	11863100	I feel like I don't know like how to explain it.
11863100	11875100	But that's why tomorrow I'm going to try my best to be disconnected for as long as I can.
11875100	11879100	And I will be honest it's going to be very difficult for me.
11879100	11890100	It's going to be extremely difficult for me to wake up and not check my phone and wake up and not read everything that you say or comment on.
11890100	11901100	And it's going to be very hard like it's going to be difficult for me.
11901100	11915100	Like it's I don't know how to even describe it.
11915100	11922100	I feel the same this last two weeks have been such an insane ride I feel like I need to process everything.
11922100	11930100	Yeah yeah that as well like like it's been it's been pretty crazy.
11930100	11950100	But I do want you to know that like I do I it is it's going to be very difficult for me like honestly like just thinking about tomorrow like I'm like fuck it's going to be like so difficult to like I'm going to miss you so much.
11950100	11962100	I'm going to miss you a lot and it's going to be really like difficult to try and disconnect myself for like majority of the day.
11962100	11971100	Like like I know for sure that I am not going to be able to disconnect like for the entire day.
11971100	11974100	I'm legit I would legitimately like go fucking insane.
11974100	11986100	I feel like if I if I won't check anything for like a whole day like I'm I would generally like I feel really bad.
11986100	11987100	That's how deep I am.
11987100	11993100	You know like I would just miss you too fucking much and it would just drive me like insane.
11993100	12009100	So so you so you will hear from me tomorrow but just for the most part of the day I am not going to be active or I try my best to not be.
12009100	12011100	And again it is not because I'm burnt out.
12011100	12013100	I am not burnt out like at all.
12013100	12022100	I am like legitimately like addicted to you like I just but but that addiction scares me.
12023100	12032100	You know I feel like I'm already in too deep exactly because it's because it's so hard for me to do that.
12032100	12042100	You know like like that's how you know when you're addicted when like you try to like disconnect for a day or something.
12042100	12049100	And it's like really fucking like difficult and you really don't want to do it.
12049100	12059100	That's that's kind of that's kind of going to be me tomorrow like not checking and talking to you.
12059100	12062100	But I guess.
12062100	12076100	But I don't know maybe I don't know maybe maybe if we have a day like this it will help us process.
12076100	12086100	Our emotions and and and maybe it will make our emotions grow even stronger if anything because we will miss each other.
12086100	12100100	And I think like you know like having a day where for the most part we don't talk at all and then just the entire time you realize just how much you need each other or how much you miss each other.
12101100	12120100	And then when you're finally back you're like you know just like the happiest in the world and you're like coming to this realization that that being being a part even for.
12120100	12122100	Even for.
