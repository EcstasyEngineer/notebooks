74
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:47,440
Mother tells me she had followed a trail from a mysterious wreckage and found me in a cave.

75
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,440
I was surrounded by death and darkness.

76
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,440
Yet I was the only one to survive.

77
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,440
This day she told me of was the last time I had ever cried.

78
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,440
She had seen the unfathomable abuse that plagued her family for generations.

79
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,440
A monster of a bear that wriggled fear throughout the food chain of this land.

80
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Its mere presence pressing the very soil under the snow

81
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,440
that here it was that at the hands of a mere child

82
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,440
was said crying alone.

83
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,440
It was then she had decided to raise me as her own

84
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,440
along with my brother and sister.

85
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,440
She taught me strength to hunt to survive.

86
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,440
I had no memories of my birth family.

87
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,440
I did not feel the need to search for them

88
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,440
or I had my family here and they had me.

89
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,440
I was a bear like them and they treated me no different.

90
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,440
We all shared the same love

91
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,440
but mama knew it was not meant to be.

92
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
There comes a time in the bear's life

93
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,440
where they must go out on their own

94
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,440
and that time was approaching fast.

95
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Mama knew the cops would be fine

96
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,440
but me I couldn't even find them being without them

97
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,440
until one day over the mountains

98
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,440
she happened upon an answer.

99
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,440
An answer I didn't want to accept

100
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,440
but one I had to.

101
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,440
And now this day

102
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,440
the day fear finally formed in my heart for the first time

103
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,440
saying their final goodbyes

104
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
my brother went one way

105
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,440
my sister went another

106
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,440
but there I stood

107
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
my body and mind

108
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,440
tempered from this land of unforgiving cold

109
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,440
was frozen still.

110
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,440
Mother offered me her strength one last time

111
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,440
enough to cement the final memory of her tenderness

112
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,440
my final goodbye

113
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,440
she would watch over me one last time

114
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,440
on my journey down from the mountain top

115
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,440
into the unknown of the future

116
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,440
the memory of her love within me

117
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,440
made the fear in my heart melt away

118
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,440
like the ice and spring

119
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,440
but she reminded me that the warmth of her love

120
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,440
made me into a survivor

121
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,440
The End

122
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,440
Hello everybody

123
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,440
Hi, it's so good to see you. Hello

124
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,440
My name is Icing Snowpaws

125
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,440
the feral polar bear from VLR's Generation 1

126
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
in Daulge

127
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,440
It's so good to see everyone

128
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,440
I have to admit, I'm feeling quite, you know, quite nervous

129
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,440
so I think the thing we should probably start with

130
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,440
how about we break the ice?

131
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Come on!

132
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Okay, well, that doesn't really seem to work that well

133
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,440
I got too big of a chunk of ice

134
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,440
so maybe we'll be able to break the ice a bit later

135
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
I hope you don't mind

136
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,440
With that being said, I heard from civilization

137
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,440
that it's supposed to be good manners

138
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,440
if you bring some nice food or a treat

139
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,440
to a big social gathering

140
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,440
which I assume what today is, right?

141
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,440
So, I actually made something for you to eat

142
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,440
I brought some fresh ice-cones just for you

143
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,440
and I really, really hope that you will like them

144
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,440
I put so much heart into them

145
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,440
and I was like, mmm, I really hope that they will enjoy them

146
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Oh, awesome, don't worry

147
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,440
It's just lemon, nothing else, so...

148
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Don't worry about it, it's very nice and delicious

149
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Also, with that being said

150
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,440
I really want to go outside and play in the snow

151
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,440
so I can actually tell you a bit more about myself

152
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
You know why?

153
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Because with my big pause paper is just kind of too much for me

154
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,440
and hard to deal with

155
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,440
So, I think what we should do

156
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,440
is you should come outside together with me

157
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
I know you're really cozy in your room

158
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
but I think we should go outside

159
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Come on now!

160
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Open the door

161
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,440
or I'm going to throw rock through your window, you dumb whore

162
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
Get back here, you little freak

163
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Get back here, you little freak

164
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Yay, we are now finally outside

165
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,440
I'm sorry I had to drag you out

166
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,440
but you know, you seem to be very resistive

167
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,440
so I thought it would be a good idea

168
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
if I just drag you out

169
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
With that being said

170
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,440
let's get to know me a little bit better

171
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
Let me drop over the snow

172
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,440
because that makes it easier on my pause

173
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
I hope you don't mind

174
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,440
So, my name is Isisnopause

175
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,440
My birthday, 27th of February

176
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Did you actually know

177
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
that 27th of February

178
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,440
is also National Polar Bear Day?

179
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
Well, now you know

180
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
Age

181
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,440
I honestly have no idea

182
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Animals do not really have concept of time

183
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,440
we do not keep track of stuff like ages

184
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,440
or what week it is and such

185
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
so you're just gonna have to

186
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
assume for yourself

187
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,440
My height is 142 cm

188
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,440
2 cm taller than Emi

189
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,440
That means I'm extra cool

190
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
My languages

191
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,440
I speak English and Russian

192
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,440
Привет всем

193
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,440
Меня зовут Isisnopause

194
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Я очень рада вас видеть сегодня

195
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Спасибо, что вы пришли увидеть меня

196
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Ok

197
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
For the next information

198
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,440
we have some of my likes

199
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
and dislikes

200
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
I'll move a little bit

201
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
so you can see the full thing

202
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
Likes

203
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,440
I love popsicles

204
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
Very yummy

205
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
Refreshing

206
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Cats

207
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
They're just so freaking cute

208
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,440
I have two cats over here

209
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
His name is Baklash

210
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,440
And her name is Potato

211
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,440
They're my two cats and I love them a lot

212
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,440
I love spinning on chairs

213
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,440
because it reminds me of amusement parks

214
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
and if I can't go to an amusement park

215
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,440
I can just go spin on chairs

216
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
It's just fun

217
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Biting feels good against my teeth

218
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,440
Plushies, they're just so cute

219
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
There can never be enough of them

220
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,440
I just love collecting more and more

221
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,440
The feeling of nostalgia

222
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
Just makes me really really happy

223
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
That's really all there is to it

224
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,440
I love sparkly and shiny things

225
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Like if I see glitter or something shiny

226
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
I just go

227
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Wow, I need that

228
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
I need to see what's that about

229
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
I also love getting praised

230
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,440
I mean, who doesn't to be honest

231
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,440
Good words always make me smile

232
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,440
I love salmon and tuna

233
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,440
They're my favorite fish to eat

234
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
They're just so delicious

235
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,440
Really can't go wrong with them

236
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
I love sweet alcohol

237
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,440
Because if you give me something bitter

238
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
I'm just not gonna drink it

239
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
I like to have a nice flavor in my mouth

240
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,440
Coffee, I only drink it decaf

241
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Because caffeine makes my tummy upset

242
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Probably not good for a polar bear diet

243
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,440
This likes dust

244
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Usually makes my nose

245
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,440
Like

246
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Itchy and sneezy

247
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,440
And yeah, I just don't like it

248
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
Extreme heat

249
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,440
I mean, my body just doesn't deal well with it

250
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Considering I'm a polar bear

251
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,440
So that's about that

252
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Math, numbers, anything related to that

253
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Just makes my brain extremely foggy

254
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
I love popcorn

255
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,440
But I hate when it gets stuck in my teeth

256
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,440
So I kind of have a love-hate relationship

257
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,440
With popcorn because of that

258
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Because I'm always really scared

259
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
That a piece is gonna get stuck

260
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
And I'm not gonna be able to take it out

261
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,440
And next we have my tags

262
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,440
My Oshi mark

263
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,440
If you want to Oshi me and you like me

264
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,440
It's polar bear and an ice cube

265
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,440
My life tag is

266
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,440
Ice line

267
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
My fan art tag is

268
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,440
IC canvas

269
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
For, you know, more

270
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Not safe work art

271
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
IC Oshi

272
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
For those of you who enjoy the more

273
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Loot stuff

274
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
Clips

275
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
IC clipped

276
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,440
Memes

277
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
IC memes

278
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,440
And fan name, which is your name

279
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Is snowberries

280
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
I was trying to find a name

281
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,440
That was supposed to be like

282
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,440
With a cute pond and stuff like that

283
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,440
And you look so cute

284
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
You look kind of like a blueberry

285
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,440
But you're also a bear

286
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,440
So I was like, hmm

287
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
Let's see what kind of name could I pick

288
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,440
That's like has a pond

289
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,440
And it's also like really cute and stuff

290
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,440
So I was like, wait

291
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,440
Snowberry sounds so cool and like

292
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,440
Just super cute

293
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
Also, before I go to the next slide

294
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,440
There will be some slides that you will not see

295
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,440
In this debut

296
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,440
You will have to come to my debut 2.0

297
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,440
In order to see the rest of the slides

298
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,440
As our time is

299
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,440
Fair limited today

300
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,440
So I hope you understand and

301
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Maybe just get even more curious about me next

302
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,440
I also have

303
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Lots of credits

304
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,440
For all the wonderful people

305
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Who made today

306
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,440
Possible

307
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,440
They all worked very hard to make everything

308
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,440
Beautiful

309
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,440
Nice looking and I really appreciate

310
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,440
Everyone's hard work

311
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
That they've put into everything

312
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,440
That they've made

313
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,440
And now

314
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,440
Wow

315
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,440
If you are wondering

316
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,440
What this is

317
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,440
This is actually

318
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,440
My little diary thing

319
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,440
And I like to write

320
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,440
Important things in my diary

321
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,440
And of course how could I not

322
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Write in my diary about my friends

323
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,440
My beautiful gen mates

324
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,440
That I love so much

325
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,440
And that make me so happy

326
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,440
So let me

327
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
Let me start with

328
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Strony

329
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,440
Strony there's just so much to say

330
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,440
She's so understanding

331
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
She's always there for me

332
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,440
She is so hard working

333
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,440
And it's like a quality that

334
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
I really wish that

335
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
I can become more like her

336
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,440
And learn to be more like her

337
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,440
It's just

338
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,440
It's humanly

339
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,440
Impossible to me

340
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,440
That someone is possible

341
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Someone is able

342
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,440
Sorry

343
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,440
I'm drawing on my words a bit

344
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Sorry

345
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,440
It's crazy

346
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
How much she works genuinely

347
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,440
And she's really amazing

348
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,440
So supportive really

349
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,440
But good things to say about her

350
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,440
Then we have

351
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Shibi

352
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,440
Just look at her

353
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,440
She's just so cool

354
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,440
And I feel like if I was walking somewhere

355
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,440
And she was walking with me

356
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,440
I would just feel so much safety around her

357
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,440
Like she looks like

358
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,440
She could beat the shit out of someone

359
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,440
If they were trying to caress me

360
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Or do something

361
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
And she's just overall really cool

362
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,440
And she's really

363
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,440
She's all of that

364
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,440
You know

365
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,440
Cold outside

366
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,440
Texture she has

367
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,440
She is very sweet

368
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,440
And I love her

369
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,440
And then we have Marcy

370
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,440
Our Yandere

371
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,440
She's very outgoing

372
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,440
Super sweet

373
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,440
And silly

374
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,440
One of the qualities that I hope to

375
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Learn to be more like her

376
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,440
Is I hope that

377
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,440
I can be more outgoing like her

378
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,440
She is so good at like

379
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,440
Always initiating conversations

380
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,440
But I'm like the kind of person

381
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,440
Who is too scared to initiate conversations

382
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,440
With anyone

383
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
So I always talk like in group chat

384
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
But

385
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,440
I never initiate because I get really shy

386
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,440
And nervous

387
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,440
And stuff like that

388
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,440
I love Marcy

389
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,440
She's just so cute

390
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,440
And then

391
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,440
Then look who we have here

392
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,440
We have Amy

393
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,440
Amy is so freaking talented

394
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,440
Like

395
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,440
Is there anything that she cannot do

396
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,440
She's just so talented

397
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,440
And adorable and precious

398
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,440
And she gives me that feeling

399
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,440
Of wanting to protect her

400
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,440
Now I know that she can

401
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
Protect herself very well

402
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,440
Thanks to her book

403
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,440
But with that being said

404
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,440
If she ever lost that book

405
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Or if something happened to it

406
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,440
You know, I would be there to protect her

407
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,440
With my claws

408
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,440
And make sure that she is okay

409
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,440
Hold on

410
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Let me move a little bit

411
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,440
Make myself a little bit smaller

412
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,440
So we can see

413
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,440
The beautiful Ezra

414
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,440
Hold on

415
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,440
Okay, that's kind of better

416
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,440
I think

417
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,440
Okay

418
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,440
Okay, so we have Ezra

419
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,440
Oh my god, Ezra

420
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,440
Her voice is

421
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
Just so calming

422
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,440
Soothing

423
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,440
Even when she speaks normally

424
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,440
She always sounds so

425
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,440
Calming

426
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,440
It's insane, it's like she has

427
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,440
Just default ASMR voice

428
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
It's something I've never heard before

429
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,440
She is also very wise

430
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,440
And gentle

431
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,440
Like kind

432
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,440
And warm

433
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,440
And she really gives good

434
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Wise advices as well

435
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,440
Like if I am not sure about something

436
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,440
Or I'm gonna do something

437
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,440
I usually like ask about it

438
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,440
And then she always comes up with

439
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Good advices that just kind of

440
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Make me go like

441
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,440
I should think about that

442
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,440
But yeah, she's just so smart

443
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,440
And yeah, I love

444
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,440
All of my gen mates

445
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,440
So amazing

446
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,440
They're all so sweet

447
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,440
All of them have amazing qualities

448
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,440
And I just feel so incredibly lucky

449
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,440
To be working alongside them

450
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,440
And be here today

451
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,440
I am now

452
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,440
Going to

453
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,440
Go to my room

454
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,440
So I can show you some of my toggles as well

455
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,440
Hi

456
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,440
Let me come in

457
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,440
Okay

458
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,440
I think this is good enough

459
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,440
I think this is fine

460
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,440
I have lots of animations

461
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,440
And different stuff to show you

462
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,440
So let's start with the first one

463
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,440
Whenever you make me angry

464
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,440
I hope you are careful

465
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,440
Because I'm definitely gonna use my claws

466
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,440
On you

467
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,440
And I will not hesitate to use some of you annoying me

468
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,440
But there are times when

469
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,440
You do say something really sweet to me

470
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,440
And

471
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,440
It makes me blush

472
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
And sometimes I do have my moments where

473
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,440
Even someone like me can get a bit

474
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,440
Flustered

475
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,440
I'm also having

476
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,440
A lot of tears of joy right now

477
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,440
Because everyone

478
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,440
Is making me so happy

479
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,440
Tears of joy are

480
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,440
Truly truly the best

481
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
Wow

482
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,440
Sometimes something suspicious happens

483
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,440
That really makes me think

484
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,440
And go hmm

485
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
Something's weird going on

486
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,440
Something's

487
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,440
Kind of suspicious

488
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,440
And

489
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,440
I also have

490
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,440
Heart eyes for all the times

491
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,440
That you make me feel extremely

492
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
Loved and happy

493
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,440
So you will get to see me

494
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,440
Show a bit of love every once in a while

495
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Even I have

496
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,440
My soft side as well

497
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,440
What happened?

498
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,440
What's that?

499
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
What? I can hear you

500
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Wow

501
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,440
So many people

502
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,440
Wow

503
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,440
You know

504
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,440
Sometimes disappointing things happen as well

505
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,440
And you just go

506
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
Oh well

507
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,440
But that is not today

508
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,440
That is definitely not today

509
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,440
I don't know if you remember

510
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,440
But I actually talked about dust

511
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
And my room is a bit dusty

512
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
And dust makes me sneeze

513
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,440
And my nose itchy

514
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,440
And stuff like that

515
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,440
So sometimes

516
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,440
It makes me sneeze

517
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Kind of like

518
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,440
Kind of like right now

519
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Wait I think

520
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
I feel another one coming

521
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,440
Another one coming

522
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
Never mind

523
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,440
Never mind

524
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,440
I don't feel it anymore

525
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,440
I don't feel it anymore

526
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,440
I wonder if I'm

527
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
Missing anything

528
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,440
Actually yes I am

529
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,440
I just remembered

530
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,440
I don't know if you guys know

531
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,440
But polar bears don't hibernate actually

532
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,440
So I have times

533
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,440
When I get extremely tired

534
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,440
And that results in me

535
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,440
Having dark eye circles

536
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,440
That's

537
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,440
Honestly going to be me today

538
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,440
Because I have to stay up extremely late

539
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,440
So

540
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,440
If you see me during the group collab

541
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,440
And I look like this

542
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,440
You know why because I'm extremely tired

543
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,440
And sleepy

544
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,440
Last but not least

545
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,440
Before we go to the next thing

546
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,440
I have my

547
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,440
Schedule

548
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,440
Yay

549
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,440
Yay schedule

550
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
Okay so

551
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Tomorrow

552
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,440
It will be my debut

553
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,440
2.12

554
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,440
And then I'll be playing

555
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,440
Tomb Raider Legend

556
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,440
After that I will be playing

557
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,440
Rockstar live simulator on Tuesday

558
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
And then Wednesday

559
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,440
I'll be napping and recharging

560
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,440
And then Thursday

561
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
We'll be playing little polar bear

562
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,440
And the great bear

563
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,440
Maybe you get to know some more stuff about me

564
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
And my polar bear life

565
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,440
And then Friday

566
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,440
I'll be doing some ASMR stream

567
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,440
And then Saturday

568
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,440
It's gonna be a very fun stream

569
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,440
Saturday is going to be

570
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,440
An archive DJ stream

571
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,440
Where I'll also be drinking

572
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,440
And when I DJ I party hard

573
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,440
I go hard

574
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,440
So I hope you get all the energy that you can

575
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,440
Because we'll be playing lots of amazing music

576
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,440
And we'll be doing lots of good stuff

577
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,440
Okay now that we've been

578
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,440
Talking for a bit

579
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,440
And showing you the schedule

580
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,440
The slides

581
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,440
I think we need to do something

582
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,440
Something a little bit more like

583
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,440
Big and exciting and fun

584
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Like you know

585
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,440
Sledges are nice

586
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,440
And all of that

587
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,440
But we should really celebrate

588
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Via Laura's big debut today

589
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,440
And all of our wonderful girls

590
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,440
So I think

591
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,440
What we should do right now

592
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,440
Is go outside

593
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,440
And I'll show you where I'll take you

594
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,440
Hi

595
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,440
Here I am

596
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,440
Once again

597
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Can you tell where we are

598
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,440
Well, in case you can't

599
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,440
This is the ice hole

600
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,440
Yes, this is the ice hole club

601
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,440
Literally

602
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,440
Looks like ice

603
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,440
It has a hole in it

604
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,440
And who DJs in that club

605
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,440
I mean, me obviously

606
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,440
I am the DJ

607
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,440
Of this club

608
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,440
And I thought it would be a good idea

609
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,440
To party with you tonight

610
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,440
And show you around

611
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,440
And do some really fun stuff

612
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,440
So do you want to go to the ice hole

613
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,440
Together with me

614
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,440
Do you want to enter the ice hole

615
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,440
Because if you do

616
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,440
I hope you're ready

617
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,440
Well, we are finally together

618
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,440
In the ice hole

619
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,440
Well, do you like my DJ booth

620
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,440
Are you ready to party or what

621
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,440

Go hard

631
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,440

00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,440
And start dancing with me

637
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,440
Tonight

638
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,440

That's all we have time for today

659
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,440
The police shows up to shut down our club

660
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,440
We're being loud

661
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,440
It's okay though

662
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,440
Because you'll be in good hands with Azura

00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,440
