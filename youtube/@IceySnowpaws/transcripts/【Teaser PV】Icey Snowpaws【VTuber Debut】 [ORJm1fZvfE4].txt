Hi, I'm Ice Snow Paws.
What in a while?
Maybe my big polar bear paws give it away.
I'm here to be the kusugaki that's missing from your life.
Name one right now.
I'll give you 3 seconds.
You can't.
Well, now you can though.
As well as being cute and funny, I'm also into DJing, SMR, and enjoy playing video games
for the first time on stream.
So on June 1st, you better come see me, or else I'm gonna bite your p***s off.
