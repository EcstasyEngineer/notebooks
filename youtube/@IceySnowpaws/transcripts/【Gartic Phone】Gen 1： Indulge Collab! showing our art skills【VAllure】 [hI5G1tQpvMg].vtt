WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
What?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Oh, I don't know.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
What?

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
What is happening?

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm live right now. I'm live. I'm live too.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
What are we even doing?

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Oh God, what a disaster.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
What?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Blah blah blah blah blah.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
What? We're live! We're live in me!

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
She's like, fuck this stream. I'm gonna go make some tea.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
What a disaster.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Oh my God.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
What?

02:12.000 --> 02:20.000
Power washer, if you haven't played the entire campaign, it doesn't allow you to have six persons in your lobby.

02:20.000 --> 02:30.000
And I'm the only one with a finished save file and it was too late to like ship all the like code and information to like send on on your stream.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
And so basically she be rescued. She be was like, right, I'll set this one out. You guys just do it.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
And we're like, no, we can't do it. The whole point of this is that we're all together in this.

02:41.000 --> 02:48.000
So then we're like, right, who's got Gmod, right? I don't have it, right? Who's got Raph, right? I don't have it, right? Who's got this game? I don't have it.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I was trying my best.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
She was like going through the list. She was flicking them pages like next page, next page, next game, next game.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Okay, that won't work.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Okay, sure.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
All right, we'll do Jack Fox. And then wait, that requires us to screen record this court.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
I'm like, we can't have that. We see every just things in the discord.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
We don't even have a HR department. So we can't share.

03:12.000 --> 03:19.000
So then, um, garlic phone, which I've never played before is coming in clutch right now.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
Um, Amy's currently making a cup of tea at Mercy.

03:23.000 --> 03:31.000
Um, is just getting a room set up for her.

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
Um, because she accidentally nuked her vault of her, the collapse room.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
It was an accident.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Oh my God.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
This couldn't have gone any worse.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I think that's like pretty on character.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yeah.

03:49.000 --> 04:00.000
If someone could insert that meme and put all of her hairs on it and be like, oh, aren't, aren't VTubers cute when they're almost, or a little, almost, a little.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
That's all I'm going to say. Well, you guys can finish the sentence after that.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
But that was, I can't.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
No, I'm kidding.

04:08.000 --> 04:21.000
I was like, okay, I'm going to be honest. When they, when the harem told me they were called harem, I read it as harem.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
And I was like, that makes no sense for she be character design.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
I was like, what?

04:27.000 --> 04:37.000
I have a harem of so many people that are my little, you know, play things and clients and they're my harem and that's hair.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Which is a rabbit.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
But it's not a rabbit.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Hair and rabbit are different.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
But you know what I mean?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
It's a pun.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
It's a pun.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Exactly.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
And they're also called harlots.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
The individuals are harlots or harlots.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Wait, hold on.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I thought you said hairless.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
They're hairless.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Some of them aren't.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
I can tell you that.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Check it.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Marcy, you could.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Do you still have that thumbnail, Marcy?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Are we good now?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
I got it.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Almost.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Almost, I mean.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
I'm back with tea.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
Marcy, if you still have that thumbnail, if you just throw up the stream.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Is she going to throw up on stream?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
No.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
The audience beaming.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
It should default to that.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
If you just change to the thumbnail and pick our take four.

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm literally telling herself the stream was just streaming.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
I'm sorry.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I cannot right now.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Why are they too loud?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000

How's the volume?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Yeah.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
It's my volume.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Okay.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Can you hear everyone else?

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
Who said the harlots are waxed in my chat?

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
The harlots are waxed.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I need them to be clean and proper.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000

Emmy comes at Emmy's like, oh, I'm just gonna draw myself casual and it comes out with like this fucking banger of a commission

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.840
It probably costs like $500 to do

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.360
Oh, yeah, she's like bang that out and I'm like, oh my god

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.960
Wish I could wish I had a pink a pager durable talent

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:27.080
Speaking of that, so it's heavy a fucking marshmallow. They were like, thank you for not tying down your talents

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:31.640
To the designs that you assigned them and they can be more themselves and I'm like, yeah

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.280
Why would I do that?

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:40.520
I was like, I don't know why I feel like it's such a basic things. What the fuck I need drawn out a bleeding heart

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.040
Yeah, we're just we're more or so like building upon

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:49.880
I tried the characters rather than I have changing everything literally because um

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:54.920
Oh someone rated the vtuber. They were like the only thing that would have been it better

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.840
As if you let them design their models like from the start

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:03.720
I'm like, bro, it took me a fucking year to get here. Like, oh my god. Give me like a fucking

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.120
It takes forever to

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:11.160
It is it is not like an overnight rig a vtuber model. Yeah, honestly, right? Who am I?

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:15.320
You can ask him. He knows how to do it. I'm gonna run a lot of work

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.440
Oh my god

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:27.080
Yeah, there's only a select few corpos that will let you do that. Oh, literally it takes so long. Oh, shit. Oh, shit

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.320
This is rough

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.320
Usually ones that have like artists in

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.680
Yeah, we don't

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:43.720
If not all of them say first you will have pre

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.600
pre-made

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:53.720
So it's not actually standard for the people to choose. Yeah, it's really not you

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:57.320
That's why it's usually they cast for the roles

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.600
What the fuck is that star

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.600
Oh

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:43.480
Okay, now we have to draw it. Are we ready?

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:53.320
I just I have to be ready for it even if I'm not

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.920
It's okay

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:01.080
Just draw it your way and that's the fun part. Yeah, very nice

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:06.040
I've already forgot which position everyone

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:10.040
Oh, this is so bad

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:20.120
Sorry, we flinch honestly, I would talk more but this takes so much brain power to do this

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:25.480
I'm so brain dad like I'm fucking done. I'm like

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:33.400
I'm reading chat. I'm reading everything, but I'm not responding. I'm so sorry because the everyone's

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.840
I'm just really in this

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.640
That's far too short so

01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:56.280
This is why

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.840
I don't remember what

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.120
Oh

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:28.920
We draw this as fast as we can oh fuck

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.960
No, no, no, not like this

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.040
Shit, shit, shit. I can't remember what it looked like

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.960
Is there supposed to be someone in a pirate boat by the way because I don't think I saw it

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:49.960
That's supposed to be a person in it. I don't know. It's already never already gone

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.520
if there's a person

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.640
Oh my god

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.640
Okay, that's that's easy enough

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.520
This is enough

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:10.280
Okay, gotta go fast gotta go fast

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.440

Oh my god, that was rough enough

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.880
That was rough

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.200
That's amazing

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.880
Oh

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.720
I was like, this is mr. Mittens

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.840
At least it stayed

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.360
So I did a little campfire with all of us together

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.240
Let's not surprise me

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:48.520
Oh, we're arguing over a fire say angry face. I can't like I gave him faces

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:53.400
Oh, that's so good. At the end of the day, we're all just

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.160
Okay, this is good. This stage this stage

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.920
Perfect circle

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.520
Oh

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.500
She's not in jail. She's at the cage

I was like, why is she shooting her piss?

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.400
Okay, that's supposed to be me

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:05.640
You're giving your big balls the best you need to serve us

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.160
The piss will revive him

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.440

What when have we not done

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.920
I don't know

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:46.120
I don't remember all the actions are a mystery drawing and sentences are hitting during the game

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:48.920
Which one is this secret

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:53.000
Secret seems rough. I've never done that one before

01:15:53.720 --> 01:16:00.920
All right, I'm sorry. Mr. Okay. We'll try it. We'll try it. All right last room boys last room. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um

Yeah, oh no, wait you run out of freaking words. Oh, bro. I can't erase my sense. I don't know

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:37.720
It just appears. Oh, we can't see what we're drawing

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.680
Oh

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.800
Okay, I don't know I think

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.720
I'm gonna just guess

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:57.080
What it is where it is. Oh god, that's so funny. What the fuck?

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:00.840
Oh, no, no

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:08.200
I'm gonna try to draw. Why is it so hard to draw with the mouse?

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:25.640
Can I can I put backwards does it work like that? I didn't give you his legs

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.360
Oh

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:31.880
Yeah, um

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.680
I used to somewhere there

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.920
Okay

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.880
Okay

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:58.600
Okay, that's a lot all wrong. No

What

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.040
Okay

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.000
Oh

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:24.680
Oh, I don't know what else to draw. That's that's exactly what I drew. I think

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:30.760
This is a vain reference. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.240
Oh

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.440

Wait, I spelled that wrong. Wait. Did I give them bodies? I don't think I gave them bodies. Oh my god

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:44.360
I don't even know where they are

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.320
I'm taking a shot in the dark

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:53.320
What that is going to be interpreted as and will I stop the creative flow?

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:55.880
Do you

01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:00.200
No, Amy. Amy's got a hoodie here. Oh sugar. I don't

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:02.840

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:13.720
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing anymore. I'm fucking dying

Okay, cousin. What is happening? What is this?

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:33.080
Someone had a stroke who drew this one. Hope you're feeling okay. Hope you're doing all right. Make sure you hydrate

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.640
Oh, fuck. I didn't have enough time to write it

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.480
Uh, man, how do I even draw this?

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:42.840
This is uh

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.080
That's the tongue

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:50.920
And then this is literally everyone

01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:00.120
This is so difficult. What the fuck am I drawing?

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.120
I

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:14.040
I need like a motion swipes as well and a little arrow to indicate

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:22.440
Yeah, there we go. I think I drew it correctly. Well, where is it?

Something else. This is a great. This is gonna be fucking insane

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:49.960

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.360
Oh

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:04.520
