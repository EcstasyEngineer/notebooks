next time i will definitely go to kenapi
earlier because this was really close
yeah so today we're going to be playing tomb raider legend
it's one of my most favorite games i love all of the tomb raider games from the very first one
and the thing with this game is that i can't remember exactly but i think
it it released after angel of darkness if i'm if i'm correct and and back then when tomb raider
legend got released it was like really like this big thing because the graphics were like completely
like uh different and much more realistic and it was like this really really uh big thing
you know i would like go um i would basically go on forums and stuff like that for tomb raider community
and stuff and we would all like post like uh screenshots from the game whenever they would give
like an update or a trailer about this game and we would all like talk about it and how cool
each area looks and just it was just a whole another time you know um so i really wanted to
um play this game today while you're here because uh it's definitely one of my favorites
i really love it because it's also uh for someone like me it's easier than that all the older
tomb raider games because it was easier to navigate or like figure out where to go and stuff like
that but but yeah yeah yeah i'm gonna stop yapping i'm gonna stop yapping and i am going to
uh start the game and when i start the game please let me know if the sound is too loud
let me know if you can see everything and if the sound is too loud or anything i'm gonna have to
close the game again because when you try to tap out of this game it just shits itself and
freezes so you have to fully close it and reopen it so uh what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna mute the bgm
uh i'm gonna set this thing over here for the sound of the game
um now let me open the game and then once i'm in the game uh just just let me know if there's
anything you want me to change blah blah blah blah okay hopefully hopefully this works

i already forgot how to
i already forgot how to use my freaking flare god damn it

like i think it would be weird if i only had the one i assume you have multiple
oh no okay all right well it worked it worked now
okay
it's oh god maybe i should let me go through here
fuck what am i doing wrong
i remember i said after throw oh now i just now i just make some crouch
okay let's uh let's try this again
i don't get it though what am i just like yeah like this this thing is just in my way
yeah
oh wait wait do i need to move this maybe i need to move this
hold on oh okay that's what i need to do okay okay okay i get it now i get it
we're good we're good okay now i can do this
flare's too hot for icy i want more flares i really like the red lighting that they give
so i'm sad that i don't have more
while he's dead
oh no no no it's my inner demons
um um um okay okay um
that was such a weird angle that was so awkward to do oh okay where am i
have i been here before no
okay there is a ball here what are what do we need it for
are some one of these things put that ball down here
we're balling we're balling we're balling tonight
he likes to ball with me he wants to go balling with me okay enough with the dramatic music
okay please just just let me think let me think here you go here
yeah it's your fault it's probably your fault
why did you drag us in here
i see how tired are you um i'm okay i'm okay i'm definitely less tired than i was
at the start uh when i started the stream i was very sleepy because i was
still waking up from a nappy but the more i'm playing this the more i'm like getting into the game
how much did you sleep uh i napped for
for two hours i know a lot of you are probably gonna be like i see a nap is not two hours okay
a nap is like 10 minutes maybe 15 but you don't understand for me naps are
anywhere from one to three or four hours that's just the way i am okay that's my kind of nap
okay i guess we'll go back here
ice an app is not two hours i was like 10 minutes maybe 15 while for you maybe for you
an app is 15 minutes but for me a polar bear an app can take anywhere between two to four hours
and that that's just the way it is for polar bears
we don't hibernate so we need to take very long naps in between the day to keep our energy
levels up the door might be trapped we're trapped she might be producing hibernation yeah something like
that exactly something like that micro dosing hibernation yeah
come on
producing all of my strength come on Amanda get out of there i only have limited strength come on
come on
it's over
nap stream when maybe during asmr sometimes when i do asmr i get really sleepy while i do it
so maybe we could have an asmr stream where i do asmr and then in the middle of it in the middle
of the stream i nap for a few minutes and you can like listen to my heartbeat or something while i nap
i don't know we'll figure it out
to be perfectly honest i think this is a terrible idea everyone agreed to leave things as they were
i will as much as i can but from what rottland said i'm sure there's a clue down there about what killed my
mother i have to go back there's no use trying to enter at this same point it's getting
in the river had to get in there somehow i leave you to forget snow bears do asmr for i see
no that that's not what i meant i'm still the one doing the asmr but like when i do asmr it
calms me down as well as i do it and then it makes me sleepy as a result the water i hope if you get a call
from an eye patch her through straight away i'm a little concerned about leaving her by herself
heartbeat asmr forbidden tommy noises oh god please please please don't remind me of tommy noises
uh that's you just reminded me one of the things that i hate the most about doing asmr is when
my tommy like grumbles or makes sounds it's so embarrassing that's like my least favorite part about
doing asmr
okay but what do i do what do i do i um i think i need to use my grenade
no okay i thought i could use my grenade okay maybe that's not the way maybe that's not the way
tommy noises are so cute no they're not they're embarrassing
i don't want disgusting a decent listen to my tommy making weird sounds that's so gross
oh god oh i'm scared
oh god oh i don't want to drown
oh no i'm gonna die no no no i'm gonna die i don't think i'm gonna die
oh god oh that was so bad
oh god that was so bad wait where do i go i can't even look up
put the mic up right next to the tommy i'd rather not i'd rather not oh god
oh god do i go lower
oh no i'm scared
i'm scared no i'm running out
no no no no no no no no no no no no no how do i get up how do i get up
no no no no no no no no no fuck
i keep forgetting what's the bottom to swim up god fucking damn it

good swimmer but still needs to breathe

okay I'm confused as of
in what order I need to do this
I thought originally there's no order
and I'm fine
but that doesn't seem to be the case
come on, come on
come on, come on
do I need to do it maybe fast enough?
I'm kinda wondering if that's the case
do I do it?
I do it
come on
nice! I did it! I did it!
okay I just needed to do it really fast
I just needed to do it very very fast
okay
that makes sense
okay I made it
look at me girl
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
is that what I think it is?
yeah it's a shoe
it was Amanda's
I doubt so fall off your feet bad easy
it's been unlaced
I never imagined she could have survived
there was a loss of water
she still might not have
okay we are finally out of the water
thank god
ah
finally out of the water don't need to worry about
drowning anymore
okay
okay
where do I go? I think I go this way
I hope
okay
it's story time
haha
hmm my ears
do you still find swimming relaxing?
yeah when I don't have to go underneath it for too long
that's when
that's why I do enjoy it
when Edamata gave Lara Ice's hair and ears
that would be so cool
oh my god that would be so cool
I think that would be so cute if it was possible
oh my god imagine
that would be amazing
oh my face
okay where do I go?
nah I go here
models do you hear me?
okay I think I go here
and go here
and go here
okay okay I'm doing good I'm doing good
oh no what?
why why?
why why?
why that happen?
why did it break? that doesn't make any sense
why you break? why you break on me?
stupid
hmm
okay
okay
NOOOO
please
I'm begging
no no no no no no
okay there must be something that I'm doing wrong
let's try this again
let's try this again
one last time
hmm
should be possible we need a mother or G sun
yeah we do
mother or G sun where are you?
what the fuck
okay I mean
what was the point of that?
hello?
what's up there?
um okay
that seems like it was really pointless
can I
fuck
oh my eye
why does it keep doing that though? I don't understand that
can I jump over here?
this looks like really really grab a ball right?
like it's not just me
it looks very like something you can grab
man my nose keeps being itchy
come on
oh can I do this?
okay
okay I have no idea what was the point of the other one
it literally didn't do anything
okay let's go
spider bear
spider bear
spider bear
oh god
okay I need to be fast
I need to be fast
fast and furious
let's go
come on
come on
come on
me just standing up with like zero expression
just frozen
yes it is
I don't need the binoculars
it doesn't help okay
okay let's see what do we need to do here
I see a lot of balls here
so we need to do something with the balls I assume
come on G sons I know there's enough balls of you to put in here
so help me fix the puzzle
ooh shiny
look at this pretty light
that looks so cool look
oh my god it looks like I'm in the rave
look it looks like I could DJ here
imagine if I DJ'd in here
in these lights that would be so pretty
look
now I just need like a DJ booth over here
and I could DJ that would be so cool
okay
there's a ball here
how do I get it though
okay I'll worry about that later
maybe I go up first
and figure it out from there
I can't jump here
where can I jump then
oh fuck
oh no
do I need to put the balls somewhere else maybe
hmm
oh no I don't know where to go
hmm
let's see if it makes any difference if I take the ball somewhere
somewhere else
what the heck is with the sound
hmm
hmm
okay
fuck
what is this camera angle
okay
um
um
I really need that other ball
how do I get it
where is the other ball
I really want to get it
but I don't know how
can I jump on any of these
hmm
hmm
fuck how do I get this thing
help
help
fuck I really need another ball
ooh
I really need another ball
oh my god my chat didn't work for a moment

I was getting so nervous
I was like where did everyone go
oh jeez that left me
grapple I don't know how to grapple
I thought it's e
you can borrow mine
okay thank you for your ball donation
how do I
I thought it's e
why doesn't it do it
we're still here don't worry yeah I know that now
but before that I was like
no where did everyone go
no one wants to talk to the poor bear anymore
everyone hates me
man I don't understand this
like why doesn't the grapple work
am I just stupid
like how
how do I get
how do I get up there
how do I get up there how do I get up
how do I get
how how how how how
I'm stupid I can't figure this out
how do I get up there
fuck
try moving the ball to the third button
yeah that's that's I had it
I had it here
but I guess I can move to the other one
I'm not balling right now
I'm not balling right now snowberries
I'm not balling
oh wait maybe that is the solution
wait maybe that is the solution hold on
wow maybe you were right
okay okay let's see what happens here
okay let's see what happens
okay let's see
okay
I think I go up here
up here
over here
okay and then
I can put this ball down
nice
okay
is there anything
here for me to do
I'm wondering
I don't think so
I'm thinking for me to do here
look
wait
I became the pee pee
okay let's move the other one
let's move the other one
over here
come here
let's put it right there
okay and now it opens up
this one so
maybe there's a way to get to that one
come on
too proud of that of course I'm proud of that
that was a genius idea
okay let's see
I don't see a ball over there though
is there supposed to be one
because I don't see it
I don't see more balls
where's the balls
how do I get there
I need the third ball

it's like
if he is like the binoculars in this game
when you're lost and stuff like that
it just goes
oh this is a
blah blah blah
this is a blah blah blah
yeah it just says what it is
it doesn't say what to do with it
maybe move the other balls
to other buttons
