Hello everyone! How are you guys doing? Hello! Hello to all the Snow Berries! Welcome! Welcome! Hi!
Okay, can I just be honest, like, even though it's past debut, I'm still feeling pretty nervous right now, so I'm sorry in advance if I'm still going to be a bit awkward and stuff.
It will take me a few streams to kind of get the hold of stuff and, you know, get completely fully comfy, so I hope that's understandable with you guys.
But thank you so much for showing to my 2.0 debut stream. For those who don't know what a 2.0 stream basically, most debuts these days usually don't have enough time for you to really introduce yourself fully.
Actually, we have limited time and yeah, I only had 30 minutes and well, everyone did. Sorry, I don't know why but I'm so nervous. I'm so nervous. I don't know, I'm so nervous.
I feel like I'm even more nervous than during the debut, honestly. I don't know why. I think it's because now that the debut is over, I'm like, I can actually read the chat and see what you guys are saying.
So it's like trying to read everything and trying to like settle in and stuff, so I'm sorry if I'm even more awkward than I was yesterday.
Maybe you should chill out. You know, maybe I should. Maybe I should try doing that.
I'll ban anyone trying to be mean. Oh, Amy, you're so sweet. Thank you. Yeah, be careful. Amy is here. She has lots of tricks up her sleeve because of her magic book, so make sure you behave.
Alright, there's...
There's just so many things to talk about that I don't even know where to even begin. Like, I'll be honest. I feel like I...
Okay, so there were two slides yesterday that I didn't show during my debut because I didn't have time for them.
And one of them was actually my interest on hobbies. To be honest, I have more interests than what's shown on the slide, but I can't think of them right now because I'm feeling pretty brain dead.
I took a nap before the stream. I was just so sleepy. I woke up kind of early, but it wasn't enough. I went to sleep around...
I think I went to sleep around 1 or 2 a.m. yesterday, so I was really, really tired. Very, very sleepy. I was so out of it.
That's why I was also wheezing non-stop at the group collab because my brain just dies when I get extremely sleepy.
And I just start being extra dumb and silly, and it just results in me sometimes just laughing for no reason.
Do you have a brain freeze? I do, actually. So if I go non-verbal or I go...
That's why. Because I am still nervous and I'm still kind of like... I need to shake off all those feelings.
The wheezes were cute. Thank you. I'm glad you think so.
I was scared. I didn't want to be rude because Strani was talking and then Azora was going to talk about her stuff.
And I tried so hard not to laugh. And my body just kept laughing and laughing.
And I could not stop. It was so hard to physically stop my body from laughing.
And I just couldn't. So it was wrong.
How are you, Cobb? I'm doing pretty good.
I feel like I need to take a deep breath and slowly relax.
I feel like every time I talk right now, I'm overthinking every single thing that I'm saying right now to the point where I'm saying something.
And at the same time in my brain, I'm like, oh no, what the fuck are you saying? Oh no, you sound so stupid.
Oh no, shut up. Oh no, this and that. And I'm trying so hard to make my brain stop.
I'm really overwhelmed. So it will take me a few strings before I can get the groove of things.
So I apologize in advance if I'm really all over the place.
No, I sound so cute right now. Thank you, Yumi. I appreciate it.
Okay, well, I guess let's get started. Before we get started though.
On yesterday's debut, I realized that I didn't really show off my full body.
So I'm kind of wondering if I should do that right now. Would you guys like me to start with that?
Because I feel like I zoomed in on my face, but I didn't really show my full body.
So I don't know if that's something you're interested in seeing.
Okay, okay, okay. Hold on, let me put myself in front.
Let me put myself over here.
Oh no, what the hell.
Why am I rotated like this? No.
No, why am I rotated like this? No.
I'm trying to... Oh fuck.
Okay, well, at least this is not the debut stream, so whatever.
Oh wow.
Oh wow.
Okay, so this is... Let me stand up on the desk.
So this is what my full body looks like.
And I actually didn't show you guys yesterday,
but I can actually take off my shoes as well.
I can take my shoes off. Yay.
I was thinking, you know, we are literally in my room right now,
and we're all hanging out together.
So why would I wear shoes inside my own house, you know?
So I might just take them off.
Here, have a nice once in a lifetime experience for my feet.
I don't have any nail polish or anything like that on my feet.
I'm just a polar bear.
I don't care about the stuff.
However, if you want to do it for me and you're more than welcome,
that will make it a lot easier on me.
If you want to put nail polish on me, that's fine by me.
And let's zoom in into some other parts.
I know you didn't even get to see my paws, but now you can.
So this is my really nice, juicy size.
And you can see my paws also.
You didn't really get to see that yesterday,
besides when I was showing the slides and stuff,
but now you can.
I'll try to do some streams where I show more of my body
so that you can actually see my paws and stuff like that
whenever I'm gaming and stuff like that.
Also, speaking of paws,
I want to do sometimes paw cam streams.
I think that would be pretty funny to see how clumsy I get
when I try to do things.
Maybe do some paw streams where I try snacks
or maybe paw streams where I write something cute for you
or decorate stuff.
I don't know.
My brain is kind of all over the place right now, but...
But yeah.
Let me get back in my chair.
Mm-hmm.
Whoops.
Okay.
Okay, that's better.
That's better.
I just noticed her belt is a seat belt from a crashed vehicle.
I wouldn't really say a vehicle more from...
If you saw the lore from...
Fuck, I can't talk.
From the plane that crashed.
Also, another thing, I don't know if you guys noticed,
but my necklace is made of teeth.
And I don't know if you know,
but those teeth that I have on my necklace
are actually the teeth from the big beast
in the lore video that I have defeated.
And basically what happened is
after that big event happened,
I took the teeth from that beast,
I made them into a necklace
and I put them around my neck
as a reminder for myself
that I can defeat the scariest of things
and no matter how scared I can get,
if I can defeat something as scary and big as that beast,
I can defeat anything that scares me
and push through it.
That's kind of the deeper meaning
that this necklace of teeth has for me
and I've been wearing it ever since then.
Helps remind myself when I'm scared of stuff.
Kind of like yesterday.
I was so nervous yesterday.
I was literally shaking.
My hands were shaking.
I was trying my best
not to ever look at the chat
and just pretend that I was doing another mock stream.
And I was just like...
Let's go through this.
Let's do as best as we can
and just get this over with.
Honestly, it's really nerve-wracking to go first,
but at the same time it was nice
when I was done,
when I was finally done with my debut,
it was really nice to be able to just sit back
and relax and watch all my other genmates debut
and eat nice dinner while they're doing their debuts.
I'm honestly so proud of all of my genmates.
They're amazing.
Everyone is so talented.
Whenever we were doing the mock streams and stuff,
I was like...
Honestly, I was scared.
I don't know if scared is the right word,
but I was worried.
I think worried maybe is...
Hold on, let me sit in a more comfy way.
Sorry.
I'm trying to adjust my stuff
and sit in a more comfy position.
But yeah, so...
When we were doing the mock streams
and I saw all the mocks of my genmates and stuff,
I was worried.
I was worried because they're all so talented.
They all have such good ideas
and everything that I was really worried.
I was like, oh no, I go first
and I'm gonna have the most boring and shitty debut.
So I was making me really worried
and stuff like that.
They're all so sweet and kind to me
and reassured me that it is good
and that everything is going to be okay.
There's really...
There's really not enough words for me to describe
just how amazing these girls are.
They're all so sweet, so supportive.
Also talented.
I really love them
and I appreciate any time
that they have helped me
or gave me courage
or gave me reassurance whenever.
I second yes myself
but get really insecure
and stuff like that.
But debuts are extremely nerve wracking.
They definitely are
because it's supposed to be this big day
where you want to make a good impression
and you want to do the best that you can.
I tried my best.
I tried to do the best with what I have
and I hope that it was at least good enough
or okay to be enjoyable to watch.
Sorry I keep taking deep breaths.
I talk so much that I forget to breathe in the middle.
So that's why I take deep breaths
because I'm talking so much that
I forget to breathe in the middle.
Oh my God.
It was enjoyable.
Thank you.
I'm really glad to hear that.
There's going to be a lot of yapping today
and I hope that's okay with you.
There's...
Breathe pokey.
Okay Amy.
I'm gonna do breathing exercises with Amy.
She's gonna do a guided meditation for me.
Oh my God.
Alright.
So I wanted to go over some of the slides
and some stuff that I didn't have.
That I didn't have with my slides yesterday.
So as you can already see
the slide has been here for like the best
22 minutes of me just yapping
interesting hobbies.
So DJ.
As you already probably know from yesterday
I enjoy DJing.
I'm still very amateur.
I'm still learning.
But when I tried it for the first time
I just completely fell in love with it.
It was just so fun.
I was like oh my God.
Listening to good music
and do stuff during and after it.
Especially doing transitions between songs.
It's just fun for me.
I don't know how to explain it.
I think sometimes it's one of those things
where you have to try it for yourself
and then you just end up really liking it.
The DJ part was really damn good.
Aw, thank you.
Thank you.
I'm really glad.
What made you want to start DJing?
So actually what made me start
want to try DJing
is honestly watching other DJ streamers.
I would a lot of times
just watch the DJs
and some of them had such good vibes.
They would have so much energy.
They would have all the pretty lights.
They would play really good music.
They would interact with their viewers as well.
I was like that is just so much fun.
You get to play cool music.
You get to just party and go crazy.
And you also get to talk to your viewers
and basically feel in a way like you're partying with them.
And stuff like that.
So for me it was like the more I watched other DJ streamers
the more I was like wow.
I really want to try to do that.
I want to see if I like it
and maybe do DJ streams sometime in the future
and I started getting more and more into it
and now it's going to be one of those stuff
that I would like to do at least once a week.
If not once a week
then once every other week and that makes sense.
I don't know. It depends.
I guess it depends on how I'm feeling that week
because you don't need to have a lot of energy
and be super hype and stuff.
If you DJ you can't really be like
oh hi guys.
Yeah let's DJ.
And then I turn on the music
and I'm not talking the entire time
and I'm not interacting with any of you.
Like you know what I mean?
That would be just so boring.
At that point why even DJ?
At that point why even DJ?
I also saw
Emi
write 3D rave with ICS the DJ please
and actually that is
that is actually one of my goals
one of my biggest goals
is to one day when we have
3D models
is to hopefully
I don't know how possible that would be
but I say don't let your dreams
stay dreams you know
make them a reality
and one of my biggest dreams and goals
being here in BLR is
once we have 3D models
to eventually have this really really huge event
where we will have like IRL venue
where you could come into that venue
and buy tickets
and see me and all the other girls
in 3D interact with you
while I DJ
while we all party together
and you will be able to also watch it
live online as well
as it happens
that is my biggest dream
it would just be so cool you know
I just think it would be so cool
because right now
there is like 3D VTuber concerts and stuff
but I haven't seen anyone do yet
like a cool party
with like a DJ
and dancing
and like that kind of interaction
and I don't know just
something that
that's one of my big dreams
I think it would be extremely fun
also whenever I get 3D in general
there's just so many things that I want to do
I want to do dancing streams
because I like to dance
not professionally
not professionally or anything
I just enjoy dancing it's fun
so when I have 3D I would like to do some streams
where I just dance to like different songs
or DJ in like a 3D like place
and explore different worlds
and I just think
I just think there's so many things
that you can do when you are 3D you know
like generally there's
the options are limitless
another thing that I would like to do
another idea that I had
is we would have like a 3D summer event
when me and all my gen mates
we would all be in 3D
but it would be like a summer event
so I would play a lot of house music
for that you know summer vibe
and we would be at like a 3D area
that would have like a pool
and look like all exotic and summery
while I play some music
and we are all in swimsuits
or bikinis
and we interact with you
and we party and we have fun
really another thing that I would
I would really really love to do like
a 3D pool party
with music
so I can't believe how much I've been yapping already
I need to remember to breathe
ok so
honestly I don't know
if I even need to go over it
like I wrote napping but like
who cares
like why did I think it's a good idea to
to write that like
ok and
you like napping I mean ok
what about
who cares
I don't know I'm stupid
I was really overwhelmed
but yeah I like taking naps
and usually I like to take naps before stream
so that I can wake up feeling more energized
oh my god
we enjoy the yap don't worry
thank you I'm glad to hear that
where's your favorite place to nap
I mean the bed obviously
I also
like to cook sometimes
I need to be in the right
mood for it most of the time though
I'll be honest most of the time I'm not in the mood for cooking
but when I am I can make some
pretty good stuff
yesterday I made
rice with chicken curry
and it was so yummy and delicious
I actually wanted to take a picture of that
but I forgot like
cause I ate it for lunch
and that's when I took the nap
I was extremely sleepy
I mean your loading screen has a cooking
yeah it does so I think it fits pretty well
hmm
and then next we have
ASMR
I'm actually gonna do an ASMR stream
this week
and I want you to know
like in advance
that
until I move out
which is gonna be probably around September
sadly I can't do anything
like soundproofing or anything like that
so
when I do ASMR streams
if you ever hear something from outside
or my neighbors from upstairs
the 3DO picks up
them like walking upstairs sometimes
or doing stuff it's honestly
insane how it just picks up things from the outside
it's like next time but
I'll try to see if maybe I can put
like maybe
thunder or
maybe rain sounds in the background
so that you can't
hear the background noise as much
basically
I just wanted to give a heads up
that until around September
that's my situation, that's my living situation
and I will still do my very best
to give you a good ASMR experience
and make do with what I have
basically and I hope that you'll enjoy it
I've enjoyed ASMR
for a very long time
for years now
and whenever I found out about it
that's when I felt those
those ASMR tingles and
I was like wow what is that feeling
and the thing is I have experienced ASMR
before I even knew what ASMR is
like I would get sometimes
tingles from certain sounds
but I never really knew what that sensation is
or if there's a name for it
so when I found out about ASMR
I was like wow
this is exactly the same feeling
that I got
back then
and so the more I started listening to ASMR
the more I was like
this sounds fun
I think it would be really cool to try making ASMR myself
and
try to make sounds
with different items
and seeing
what sounds they make because the cool thing about ASMR
is that
sometimes you can find an item
to make sounds with
and it can actually produce
many different sounds more than one
depending on how you tap it or how you hold it
or how you play around with it
and that's another thing that I always found cool
so sometimes I would go to random stores
and I would literally start tapping different items
or grab them
or move them around my ear
to see if it would make for a good sound
and stuff
so yeah
I'm definitely excited
to do nice ASMR
for you
and I really hope that you will enjoy it
I'm definitely going to have to
I'm definitely going to have to
make my collection bigger and bigger
I want to have an ASMR tingle box
where I will place
all the products that I'll be using to make ASMR
sounds with
so every time that I stream I can bring my tingle box
and play around with it
and make nice sounds with it
another thing
I know that ASMR also includes
whispering
and heartbeats
and sometimes
I also love to give hugs
so sometimes I will give you a hug
or a whisper
or maybe even say something
in Russian
I think I actually saw a Maro
asking me if there will be Russian
in my ASMR
and the answer is
during my ASMR streams
if there's ever a request
here we speak Russian
in my ASMR streams I could try
and do that sometimes
or take requests
something dirty
no
no Emi
I'm on YouTube
I need to be careful
you should be careful too
unless
you know maybe
okay listen maybe once we have
memberships open
maybe ASMR
membership ASMR streams
maybe there
I could get away with a little bit more
if it's also on archives
I don't know
YouTube has been
YouTube has been really weird lately
I'm just trying my best not to get in trouble
at the moment but
we'll see what happens
I also like to
make funny duels sometimes
I don't do that all the much
but when I do I have a lot of fun with it
so I'm thinking of maybe doing
eventually like a stream where
I
fuck my brain
oh my god
where I will
draw a customized version
of each
and every member that joins
on my membership
on my membership stream
I think maybe it would be a cute idea
if like I drew some
custom snowberries
for each and every person that joins
the membership
I don't know why I'm struggling so hard to talk
I really don't
I think it's because I also didn't talk for this long
in a very long time
like I really don't talk much
oh my god
a doodle stream while you're DJing would be cute
I can't do that
I need to
I need to have focus on the DJing when I DJ
that wouldn't be
possible
but it could be like a separate stream idea
where sometimes I do these stupid doodles
streams where I take requests
and draw the weirdest
ugliest things that I can
DJing requires two hands doesn't it
yeah it does
the thing is right now I don't even have a DJ deck
so my skills are not even fully
unleashed I use virtual
fuck I can't fucking talk
I use
I use
I use virtual
virtual
DJ in order to DJ
but that means I can really only use
mainly one hand
and I want to get an actual
DJ deck so that I can use both my hands
it will make it easier to mix
the songs as well in between
so that is something
that I would like to get eventually
so I can improve
I feel like not having a DJ deck
definitely limits my skills
or my ability to improve on it
uh
virtual DJ that's not what I said
I said virtual DJ
oh my god
oh my god
okay and then
oh god I'm gonna be here forever
one hand in DJing
wait a minute that's not what you think
no not like that
no I need to be on focus
I need to be on focus you know why
because I have had times when like
I was DJing and I would get
song to the music that I would actually forget to DJ
and then the song would end and I didn't do like
a transition to like another song
and I didn't mix in between so there was like complete silence
and I was like what the fuck
so no no no no I need to be fully focused
on my DJ streams because I don't want that to happen
it's so it's so embarrassing
I can't help myself some music is just so good
that I just get very into it
especially when I drink
like imagine you listen to good music and you drink
it's very easy to lose focus
to lose focus of yourself when you do those things
and then another thing
that's in my interest is retro games
I really really love retro games
it's a big part of my childhood
I will say though retro games
is not the only stuff that I will be playing
I will have like a game or two
that is more modern
or not retro
I like to try all types of different games
and if I think that I will like something I will play it
but if you do see quite a bit
of retro games and stuff like that
some weeks
that's why because I really love retro games
and there's
a lot of games that I would actually like to play
on stream
let me see
actually brought that up
there it is, here is a big listing
of some of my all time favorite
retro games actually
American McGee's Alice
it's actually the first game that comes between
before
excuse me
that
that comes before Alice Madras returns
and I actually think that this game
is even better than the second one
it's one of my all time favorites
Jazz Jack Rabbit 2
another game that's
one of my biggest childhood games
Blood Rain
all of these games here
I would be really happy to play them
so if you see anything
that you remember
or anything that looks like it would be fun
or you're excited about
then I hope you will
I hope you will enjoy watching me play those games
I really love the Tomb Raider series
all of them
but I will say though that I'm very bad at it
even in the past
when I played it as a kid
I was always bad at it
to the point that I would look for cheats
to skip certain levels
I'm just so bad at this game I don't know what it is
but I get lost very easily in games
very easily and I'm also
I'm also bad at puzzles as well
so I don't know
I love those games but I'm also too dumb to play them
that's basically what it is
and back then in Tomb Raider games
they didn't have maps
they didn't have a thing that showed you where to go next
or what to do so sometimes I would literally
spend hours and hours just circling
around the entire place
and not getting anywhere
so I was like fuck this shit I'm gonna use a cheat code
and I'm just gonna skip to the next level
so I can make progress
will I love for back seating
then to help you out
there's definitely games
where I would be more than happy
if you help me and tell me where to go
or how to solve a puzzle and stuff like that
I'll be honest
I'm not the smartest
I'm not the smartest period
I was gonna make like a sentence
but I didn't know what to say so I'm just gonna say
yeah I'm just not the smartest
to say this
I'm not good at video games but I guess it's also not surprising
I only recently came to the civilization
also I don't know if you noticed
but I also have Barbie Explorer
in my list
and the reason why it's another favorite for me
is because that game actually felt a lot like Tomb Raider
but
for babies basically
Tomb Raider but Barbie Edition
that is for
you know
for not so smart
challenged cubs like me
so that game was a lot easier
for me to play because
it was a lot easier obviously
but it still had a lot of Tomb Raider elements
so I enjoyed it a lot
GTA, Vice City
another really amazing game
that I love a lot
definitely one of my favorites, definitely a game I wanna play on stream
I'm definitely excited to
do GTA Vice City streams
I feel like it would be really funny
to do them
and when they showed
the trailer for the newest
GTA that's also in Vice City
but with the high graphics
and everything that will be available
either next
I can't remember, I think it's gonna be ready in like
2 years
I can't remember but the trailer looked so fucking good
and I'm so excited to play it whenever it does come out
yeah GTA 6
GTA 6 is gonna be wild and seeing Vice City
in almost like high graphics
I was like wow
look Vice City is looking so freaking good
I'm just so freaking high for it
it's gonna be amazing
but until then
GTA Vice City
and maybe even GTA San Andreas
are the 2 GTA games
that I would really love to play on stream
I think that would be really fun
lots of stuff to do
then we also have
ok so the thing is
silent hill
3
I remember getting this game
and wanting to play it really really badly
but I was too scared
I remember playing some levels during the day
to make it as least scary as possible
and I beat some levels
but I was too scared
I wonder if I play Silent Hill 3
on stream with your help
if maybe that would help me feel less scared
then maybe it could help me figure out
where to go
and how to solve puzzles
and all that stuff
cause I wanna like play through all of it
because it genuinely just looks so good
and cool but I'm scared
I'm too scared
I need my snowberries
to help me
and protect me
you get to prove your own growth
yeah I guess we'll see about that
there's also
there's also
there's also another one on this list
Drakan
Order of the Flames
another really good retro game
that I remember playing
but I never got to finish it because I remember
I was kinda near the end
at least I believe I was but I could never beat the level
because I think there was a puzzle or something
and I just could not figure it out
so I got to play it on stream
and hopefully actually get to finish the game
and see the ending
and you know I just think it will be
a very very nice experience to play all of these
childhood games
with you by my side
so I can talk about these games and play them
and have fun also I have the sims
I really want to make a household
in the sims of me and my gen mates
I think that would make for a really really fun stream
where it will be
excuse me
where it will be all six of us in a household
doing different things
definitely want to do that
I'll be honest
I want to play all of these games
at some point on stream so
there will obviously be other games that are now listed here
that I will
that I will play lakas in a pool and drown us
in me
I don't think I want to do stuff like that
not to my beloved friends anyways
not to my beloved friends
but I might do it to other people
depending on what happens
because the sims
the sims has an expansion pack
I think with
celebrities and stuff
and sometimes when you get very famous
sometimes you get a stalker
in your house
I think what will make for a fun content is
if we lock the stalker in a room
and then either burn him
or drown him in the water
or just like
figure out some funny things to do
that stalker me
I hope not
because your life will be ending very soon
what's wrong with VLurgers?
nothing, we are all amazing
there's nothing wrong with us
we are perfect
bruh she's gonna water board us
let's go
I need to be with the reaper
yes you do
sims 1 has very limited interactions
with the reaper
we are mentally ill
but I think it adds to our perfection
because what is a VTuber without mental illness?
bland and boring
that's right
sorry I don't know why I said that but I mean
it does add to our personality
you know
sorry
for saying weird things
I don't know what I'm doing
oh my god
ok so now that I've
yapped about some of my favorite games
let me go to
oops
no that's not what I wanted
ok here we go
oh god
here is a list
of some of my most
shameless
vlog
mistakes were made
mistakes were made
don't
ignore that
ignore that that did not happen
you did not see that that was nothing there
it was a joke guys
I put it there
and then showed it for one second exactly to get your reaction
it doesn't mean anything
anyways
here is a list of some of my most
favorite anime
happy sugar life
mitsudemoe kanon
2006
kurejime dg charat
ok I will say dg charat
I loved it so much and I'm so sad that
the original series
was like
each episode was just 5 minutes
because I tried to watch
other seasons
where they have full episodes
but they don't have the same art style
as the original dg charat
and so it just didn't hit the same
so I was like
I was like man that sucks
because I was enjoying it so much
and I just love how back then
they made the funniest expressions
back then in anime
one of the stuff that I love about older anime
is how the art style looked
and also
and also how
the expressions that they drew
I don't know they just have so much life
they just have so much soul
they don't make them like that anymore
then there is akunohana
there is nana
ichigo machimato
definitely an anime
that I want to do a watch along with
if you would like to join me
there is a couple of anime here
that I really want to do a watch along with you all
I think it would be really nice to
cozy up and watch some nice anime together
and this is definitely one of the ones that I would like
it's just really nice and cozy
elf and light
such a good anime
honestly
it's weird back then I used to be able to watch
really
what's the word
I'm trying to say
hard to watch
maybe or
let's just say
for me now
I don't know if I would be able to rewatch it
because I feel like it would just make me cry
and make me too sad
but back then I was able to watch stuff like that
without any problem it's really weird
it's like I develop emotions
it's like I develop emotions now
now that I'm here in civilization
suddenly I'm feeling emotions
and I can't watch some stuff that I used to watch
I can't fucking talk
I don't master Cinderella girls
you 149
another one I would love to do a watch along with
another one that I want to do a watch along with
it's so funny I love it
I don't think I'll do a watch along with that
the thing for me with Made on Abyss
it is such a freaking good anime
but it is too hard breaking for me to
rewatch it
I remember crying so much watching it
I felt like I'm gonna get into depression
or something after watching it
I don't want to risk that
it's just too sad to watch again
but it is extremely extremely good anime
the story is very good
but my heart is just too soft
to rewatch stuff like that
as a mankadeyo
another good anime
and a huge huge favorite of mine
I just remember so many good memories watching it
I think it would be genuinely so so fun
school days
another good anime
the ending
I love the ending it was so good
another really good and funny one
that I used to enjoy a lot
I also remember
NHK
Yugosl
another big anime
that was one of my favorites
I don't know if it sounds cringe
but welcome to the NHK
sorry
fuck I can't talk
I'm talking so much that I feel like I'm eating my words
and like I can't talk
okay okay
okay
okay
they are being
okay
so when I watched
welcome to the NHK
I don't know if it's cringe
but
you know the girl in the anime
that he talks to the girl with the short hair
that's wearing a white yellow t-shirt
I can't remember what her name is
but I remember watching this anime
and being like
yeah she saw me
one day I'm gonna find a guy just like that
and I'm gonna fix
I'm gonna be just like her
and then I'm gonna find someone to fix
and then there's like that scene
at the end
where she's really sad
and I think I can't remember
but correct me if I'm wrong
she is you know really depressed
and sad as well
and I think she is like about to
end her life I think
and I was like oh my god that's literally me
I would like literally watch that episode
while I was crying and I was like
it's literally me
they made this anime about me
oh my god
yeah um I relate
I relate it too hard too
she's literally me
oh my god yeah that was one of those
moments where I look back on
and I'm kinda cringing
I can't fix each other
you never know we might
I'm hopeful
I'm hopeful for the future
in the book he fixes her
yeah I was like oh my god that's so romantic
I really wanted him to kiss her
in that scene I was like oh my god I hope they kiss
I hope they kiss
it makes each other by being together
and then love life
I love
why does that sentence sound so weird to say
I love love life
I'm probably overthinking it
I really love the love life series
I've watched all the seasons
I've loved every single one of them
and I might go watch along
of those as well
who is your love life best girl
for each generation
it's a different girl
so for me
in the first generation
honestly first generation is so good
it's hard to pick a favorite
but whenever I played the rhythm
love life game
I would always make sure to get
the ultra rare cards
for Niko's birthday
and Allie
I used to really like Allie because
she is part Russian
and she loves chocolate a lot
and I was like oh my god she is literally me
but her personality wasn't really me
but because
she was part Russian
and because
she would really love chocolate
I was like she is literally me
I think
I think now I would probably be closer
I would probably be closer to Niko
to be honest
but I don't have my sweet moments
as well so I would
I would definitely have to be like a mix between Niko
and like another girl
but I'm not sure who
maybe Rin
because I don't know if you ever watched
love life but
in the first generation
there is an episode about Rin
where
where she really wants to
feel girly
and cute and she struggles
to feel that way
and I can't remember
in details about the episode but basically
she feels like she is not cute enough
but she wants to be
and I think at some point of the episode
she finally gets to wear a really
feminine and super cute
freely idol dress
for one of her performances
and that's when she gets extremely happy
and she finally feels cute enough
and I really
I really relate it to that
episode and to her because
I would have moments too
where I wanted to be
extremely cute
and I would always worry that
I'm not cute enough
I don't know, my personality is not cute enough
and yeah
and that's the thing, I really love
girly stuff
I really love plushies, I love cute dresses
and skirts and all of that stuff
and it actually
wasn't until later in my life that I started
wearing dresses and skirts
because
in my early life
I felt like Rin, you know
I felt like I'm not cute enough to wear dresses
or skirts and stuff like that
but you know the more time went by
I started to experiment with
wearing dresses and skirts and stuff
and now that's pretty much the only thing that I wear
I don't have
any pants or anything
when I go outside I always wear either a skirt
or a dress when I go outside
so yeah I do wear
a bunch of cute stuff these days
and yeah that's
like one of the stuff that made me think about it
so I think
I would probably be like a mix between Rin
and Nico
also because Rin can be pretty hyper
and when I have lots of energy I can get super hyper
and extremely silly and dumb and that is
a big part of her personality as well
and then for
the second generation
for the second generation of love life
Ruby
Ruby is actually my most favorite one
because she is extremely shy and insecure
and second guesses herself
a lot
but she wants to do the best
to overcome that
and as you read
her stuff
and as time goes by
she gains confidence
and gets better and better in what she does
and it's really nice to see
the development
like from how she started
versus how she
what's the word
I'm trying to think of the word
I'm trying to say
fully develop
character development
basically she wants
from being insecure
and shy and second guessing herself
to becoming a lot more confident
and really shining through
and that's how I want to be
I want to be the same way
and whenever I get insecure and when I second guess myself
I think of Ruby and I remind myself
that if she did it I can do the same thing
and I can grow as well
and yeah
I really can't wait to see
like compare a year from now
how much I changed
I think it would be really funny if a year from now
we rewatched this exact stream
and see the difference in how I talk
and the difference in my manners
and the way that I communicate with you guys
I think that would be really funny
to be honest
because I think there would be a big difference
because right now I'm still like saddling in and shy
and overwhelmed and nervous
and I have moments where I get insecure
or second guess myself
but I know that we can all grow with time
and improve on this thing
so yeah
lane
another good anime
all of the anime here are really good
I'm just yapping so much that I end up not
talking about each and every one of them
because I feel like
I feel like I'm yapping too much
and I'm like who cares
shut up who asked
like while I'm talking about it
I'm just like who asked
who cares
why was I talking about this
no no we love the app
we care
we asked
you're yapping is good
we ask thank you very much
thank you
that's really sweet
thank you for saying all that stuff
it's really reassuring
and helps me
gain a little bit more confidence
I'm still
I know I'm like a big confident
like brat on twitter
and stuff like that
but when I get on stream
I'm like
I just get all shy
I don't know why
I don't know why I'm shy
why would I be shy
of some OGs that are watching me
why would I be shy
I can't help it
I'm really nervous
yeah
I wish I was naturally confident
from day one I wish I did
my 2.0 stream today and I was like
hello OGs you're all disgusting
I don't care about what you say we're gonna be talking about me
because that's all that matters
and blah blah blah
but I don't know I just I
I can't do that right now
I'm still
I'm still
I'm still trying to
get over my shyness
yeah
now that you said it you know what I think would be funny
I think it would be really funny if like right now
a lot of you enjoy my shyness
and awkwardness
and then once I get more confident
you will be like man I miss the days
when I see snow paws was so cute
and shy and reserved
now she's such a bitch
now she's such a fucking brat
what happened
oh no
oh no
no
gap might
maybe
no
kindness doesn't go away
maybe I don't know
I guess I'm just trying to be
my most authentic self
there's a sentence
that someone once said
where it says
being your authentic self
is your ideal self
so whenever I second guess myself
or I'm not sure
how much to show
of myself and stuff like that
I think of that
sentence and I'm like
just be authentic
just be as authentic as you can be because that is
the most best version of yourself
so that's what I'm gonna do
and that's just what I'm gonna do
and what I think is the best thing to do
and that's just like naturally how I am
that's the thing with me
I've always been like that
people around like new people
that I'm still getting to know
and
just start talking to
I'm always more shy and reserved
but then once you get to know me
and I get really comfortable around you
I just become a man
sometimes and I just become extra ready
and that's when you will see all of those
sides of me shine more
this small period of time
where I'm feeling still
extra shy and stuff
so enjoy this shyness
while you can I guess
so you're saying you need to defrost
that's actually a good way to
put it I think so
I think I need to defrost
give me a few more streams
and you'll probably start to see
my other parts
start to show
more and more
honestly I don't really know
what else to say regarding my anime taste
all I will say is
that I will have
um
I will do watch-alongs
of some of them and also some
that aren't listening here
because I think it would be fun
but again I also want your honest opinion
like for example if we ever do a watch-along
and you find it boring
and enjoy it
I would want you to give me feedback
and let me know
and I just won't do watch-alongs anymore
or I'll do them less or something like that
because I want to have fun
but I also want you to have fun as well
I want to still hang out together and
enjoy each other's company
one stream of overcooked 2 would kill the allure
okay I agree
I have played that game before a couple of times
and oh my god that game
at the start it's kinda manageable
but it gets so difficult
that my brain just can't handle it and it becomes just complete chaos
like I don't even know what I'm doing anymore
kinda chaos
okay so
enough
enough with this
what was I gonna show
there was another slide
I'm trying to find it
sorry
where is it
I already showed this one
where is the one I'm looking for
no not this one
no not this one
no not this one
professional streamer
okay
okay
okay so
before you say anything
I know I have some
really big goals
enormous goals
to say the least but
again
I'm a believer in
the ability
for us to reach our dreams and make them
a reality even if at first they seem
really out of reach
and big
the more time goes the more
I think it's possible to reach them
and continue working towards
all of them
so my first goal
is a youtube play button
to get
and such a big milestone to reach
I think when a few years pass by
and I look back on it I would be like wow
I really did that
I actually achieved that
that's so cool
another goal that I have is the 3D DJ party
that I already actually brought up
in today's stream I already touched
based on that and explained it
I really want to have a 3D DJ party
in an IRL venue
where you guys could actually go inside an IRL venue
and see us in 3D
and dance with us and party with us
and interact with us
I think that would be such a cool concept
that's different than the usual
Vtuber concerts because that's been done
multiple times but this specific thing
hasn't been done yet and I'm really hoping that
VLR can be the first
place to make that happen
I just think it would be a really cool thing to do
original song
is another thing that I'm hoping to achieve
now I'm not a singer
by any means
I don't have those amazing singing skills
or nothing
but again it's one of those things
that I really want to
write off my bucket list
it's one of the things that I want to know
that I did at least once in my life
really cute and cool to have
my own original song made
and I don't know I think that would be exciting
and really cool
any ideas for the song
as of right now I'll be honest
I'm not so sure
but I think the more time goes
the more I'll probably
have more of an idea
right now it's more of a general goal
I don't really have the details
figured out and stuff like that yet
another goal of mine
is by parents
a house or be able
to support them enough so that
they can retire
my parents are both really the most amazing people
in the world
they've given everything for me and beyond
they always made sure
to keep me as happy as I can
always work extremely hard
always been supportive
of what I wanted to do
always loved me and accepted me
the more time goes by
the more I'm like
I just really want them to retire
I really want the rest of their lives
to be just relaxing
and having a good time
and not worry about work anymore
and get them a nice house
where they can be living life
because they genuinely deserve it
they've given me so much love
just so many things
to be honest this goal
is my number one goal
to be honest
if I can give that to them one day
I'll honestly be the most fulfilled
and happy that I can be
you know that I can give my parents a better life
and give them back
for all the insane
amount of love and attention and hard work
that they've put into me
I love them very much
they actually
know that I'm a VTuber and that I stream
and they're extremely supportive
and they're super sweet about it
actually whenever I
sometimes I would talk with them
and video chat with them
and so there was this one time when I showed them
what I look like
in my polar bear form
and they were amazed
they were like wow it looks just like you
they were so excited they got
and I also remember when I got
the email
the big email from VLR
for an interview and stuff
I told my parents when I finally got accepted
and my dad was so happy for me
that he started dancing
and he almost fell
I was so sweet and supportive
and happy for me
it was just super cute and I'm like
man I do it for that
I also want to adopt
many more cats
so they can have better life
and a forever home
I have two cats already but I do want to have more
because I really love going to the animal shelter
and check
on the new cats that I have sometimes
and
sorry
and there's just so many
cats in there that are super sweet
and nice and
I just want them to give them a good life
I want to know
that this cute cat or these cute cats
will live their best life
that they possibly can experience
so that's another thing that I really want to do
there's also a lot of
such sweet old cats that don't get adopted
I really want to adopt
some old cats as well
I feel like they really deserve a lot of love
and I really want to make sure that the time
that they do have left
will be spent being the happiest that they can be
and then another goal
is to appear at cons
or meet ups and stuff like that to meet you
it's just such a big dream of mine
I think it would be like honestly
the coolest thing ever to actually see all of you
and talk to you and say hi to you
and I don't know isn't that exciting
that would be just
like you know
the coolest thing ever
and it's just
I don't know there's just something about it
that would make me feel really happy
and excited to actually get to meet each and one of you
and it's just
it's just really cool and I hope I get
to do that
I really hope I get to do that someday
I think that would be really nice thing
to do
hold on
sorry
my eye was itchy
I had to scratch it back
okay so
this
my mom
okay now
okay so
I mean
I don't know if you know
but
but
oops

へா, Normal the stuff that
ар, That we are土
I want to say something else that I
have a word almost salad in my mouth
and I keep talking
and
and
OK
Take a deep breath
OK, so
Now that the merch is officially open, I want you all to know that 100% of...
How do you word it? Fuck, man, I'm really bad at this, huh?
Why did they hire me?
I basically got 100% of all sales, yeah, yeah, yeah, all sales, yeah, I get 100% of sales.
So if you want to support me, this is a really, really good way to support me and my gen mates, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Amazing, right? Okay, so let me show you some of the merch.
We have a cute keychain with an acrylic, me being all EP and cute.
And look at that.
Thank God this is not my official debut, because wow, that would have been like the shittiest debut in all history.
The cute thing about the keychain is that you can basically carry me around anywhere you go.
You go, if you go anywhere, just put me on your back or as a phone charm or wherever and I'll just be there.
Just like pocket, icy snowpies, always there to give you moral support.
I don't know what I'm saying.
And then another thing that we have, excuse me, an acrylic stand.
So in those days that you don't go anywhere, if you just want to be home and stay and relax,
and let's say, you know, it's the middle of the night and you're feeling lonely and you miss me and you're like,
man, I miss icy snowpies.
I wish you was here with me, coddling me.
Well, do I have the solution for you?
You see this? Just get this acrylic stand of me and put it in your bed, put the cover and
cuddle with me and just go to town.
Do whatever you want with me, you know?
Pleasure all my...
The fuck is my problem?
What is my problem?
And we also have really cool sweatpants.
So whenever you want to wear something inside your house, but still feel cool and fashionable,
you can get these sweatpants that look really cute and really cool.
They have all of these snow prints on it.
So whenever you walk around the house and someone comes in or you just look in the mirror
and you're like, man, these snow prints, wow, they make me think of icy.
Man, I miss her, but damn, do I look cool with these sweatpants?
Oh my god, I'm so sorry that you're witnessing this.
I apologize.
And then we also have a really, really cute hoodie with this really, really nice art with me on it.
So if you are the kind of person that loves hoodies and feels comfy in them, well, look at this amazing thing.
It has this beautiful art of me and then on the sides of the arms, it has those eyes.
Not eyes, fuck, I'm stupid, the freaking snowflakes.
The freaking snowflakes, that's the word I was looking for.
Oh my god, I'm stupid.
It has snowflakes on the arms and if you get it together with the sweatpants, it will be basically like I said.
However, if a hoodie is in your thing or the weather is getting too hot for a hoodie right now, for most places anyways, you can just get a t-shirt.
Yeah, now that it's getting hotter and it's becoming somewhere, you can just wear a t-shirt as well.
So if you wanna go outside or even wear it inside the house and always have me around or show everyone how cool you are, this t-shirt is definitely for you.
Definitely recommend.
I really hope that you like all these merch stuff.
Let me post the link again.
Fuck, what is enough?
Oh, okay.
Oh no, my arm, fuck.
I need to get rid of that.
I keep bringing the other fucking cold ice cones.
I keep bringing up the freaking third arm with ice cones.
I need to get rid of that.
I keep pushing it accidentally.
I just keep pushing it accidentally like a dumbass.
Oh my god, I'm sorry about that.
Hold on.
Let me sit back.
Let me sit, fuck.
Okay, let me...
Okay, now more comfy.
Nice, nice, nice.
Is that your special merch I see?
What do you mean by special?
I mean, if there's a merch of me, I mean, all of it is special, right?
Spy Team Fortress 2?
Well, what do you mean?
How could my kusuga be so cute and pun?
I honestly don't know.
It's just the nature of me, strongy.
That's how I am at first.
And as time goes by, I become more and more ready.
You are special?
Yeah, mentally.
But thank you.
What are we talking about, chat?
We're talking about my merch.
Merch?
Yeah!
Man, that was so embarrassing.
Like, what was that?
I think I'm gonna cringe at that for the rest of my life.
I'm really trying to sell stuff to you and all I have to say is merch, yeah.
Well, we know you are, but underneath the bradians...
Wait, I'm a bit confused.
What do you mean by that?
I think you missworded what you were trying to say.
Do we get an icy cup to come pre-filled?
No.
Not yet anyways.
I think.
I mean, we'll see what happens, maybe.
Maybe in the future.
You already sold it to me easy.
Wow, really?
Wow, I'm honestly impressed.
That just that alone would be enough.
It's our thing now.
Merch, yes?
Get your sentence?
Oh, no.
Out of all, like, cool sentences that I could have, like, come up with, or, like, a motto or something, like, that's the best that I have, like, really?
I think they meant underneath your guffinius, your brad.
Yeah, well, it is.
I would say that I can be, like, a bit of a sweet brat.
I don't know if that makes any sense.
Like, I enjoy being a brat because obviously it's really funny and entertaining for me,
but I have my sweet moments as well, you know?
Don't undersell yourself.
Yeah, I'm trying my best to work on becoming more confident and stuff like that, and that's second guessing myself as much.
Honestly, I would 100% buy a shirt that just says Merch, yeah?
Wow, new Merch idea.
Oh my God, Stroney, look at that.
Here you go, here's the new Merch idea.
Get a t-shirt and have it say Merch, yeah, and a picture of me.
Oh my God, that would be so goofy.
You're Merch missing a hat and shoes, if there are, it'll be full armor.
Who knows, maybe eventually that would be a thing.
I'm not really sure.
Oh my God, I keep having to clear my throat so much, I'm so sorry.
But yeah, if you notice me muting a lot, it's because I keep having to clear my throat.
I don't think, I don't know the last time I have talked so much, honestly.
I've been yapping for almost two hours non-stop, so I guess that would make sense.
I just constantly have to clear my throat, I didn't speak that much for such a long time.
Clearing your throat, she just liked me.
It's honestly really annoying, it's so annoying.
I just want to be able to talk and talk non-stop and not have it cut in my way.
At least you're comfortable streaming.
Yeah, the more streams I have, the more comfortable I'm with.
Don't mute yourself, we need every cough.
We just want to hear your sneezes because of that.
I don't know about that.
I don't know if you want to hear it.
I don't know about that.
I don't know if you want to hear it.
I don't know.
I don't know if you want to hear me clear my throat.
I don't know, that's a very pleasant sound.
Fastest yapper in the west.
That sniffing video was, well, not video short.
It's pretty cute.
Actually, I don't know if I'm allowed to say it, but I hope it's okay.
I don't think it's a bad thing.
There's actually going to be a short meme ASMR video coming up of me sniffing.
I actually noticed that after my short, a lot of people said that they really like when I do the sniffing in ASMR.
So yeah, if you really like sniffing in ASMR, a short video is going to come up.
Oh my god, no graduate right now.
I see you on that sandwich.
Okay, okay, I wasn't sure.
I wasn't sure how much I'm allowed to say or not.
But yeah, if you're into ASMR sniffing out, there will be a short ASMR video coming up with that.
I don't like sniffing ASMR.
I think it could be pretty nice.
But it's a bit tricky to do because whenever I do it, I'm not sure if I'm doing it too loud or if it sounds good or not.
So I guess you can give me feedback on that when that video is going to be up.
But will you be sniffing though?
You of course!
Yeah!
Obviously I'm going to be sniffing you.
Who cares about anything else?
I want to sniff you and know your nice scent.
Video goes up later today.
Oh, nice! I had no idea. That's awesome.
Okay, that's good to know.
So see, the sniffing ASMR is actually going to be up later today.
So yeah, thank you for letting me know, Strani.
That's awesome.
Oh, do you sound sniffing?
Yeah, trying to make sure I remember that scent very well.
Oh, do you sound sniffing?
Wait, wait, let me shower first.
Okay, well, time is ticking, so you better get in that shower.
The thing was by TF2 is there's a glitch in the mission where he has three arms, so kind of reference.
I used to play a lot of TF2 in the past.
And I used to main the heavy.
I don't know if you know why, but his Russian accent.
And because I speak Russian, I thought it would be funny to main him.
Besides that, I also really love his weapon.
I really love the ability to be extra strong in games.
And I love how fast his weapon goes.
Because it just goes just shooting non-stop.
So yeah, I used to main the heavy and it's always been really fun.
Sometimes I would also play as engineer, I think.
Sometimes I would also play as engineer, but yeah, heavy was my main.
Heavy was my main, and I just have such good memories playing TF2.
I wonder if it would be possible to ever play TF2 with you?
I would have to figure that out. How would that work if it was possible?
Because it wouldn't be cool if we played it together or something.
I mean, I'm gonna suck. I haven't played it in a few years.
It's been such a long time, but I think that would be really cool.
So if it was possible and I could figure out a way to make it work, I think that would be cool.
But regardless of that, I really want to find games that, you know, games where a lot of people can play together, if that makes sense.
I think that would be really fun as well.
I know there's like the usual fall guys and stuff, but if you have any recommendations for multiplayer games that allow quite a bit of people in it, I think that would be really cool if we can do that.
I think that would be fun to meet you in-game and play and do fun stuff.
I think that would be really nice.
Nice quality time together in a way.
I know technically this is our quality time because I'm talking to you right now, but I meant quality time where we actually do stuff together, if that makes sense.
Monster Hunter?
I'm really bad at Monster Hunter.
Like really bad.
Like so bad that...
Man, I'm really bad at games.
Like I feel in group games and stuff like that.
I'm probably just going to hold back.
Hold everyone down?
Is that how you say it?
I can't forget, there's a way to say it.
Like hold everyone back or hold everyone down.
Just because of how bad I am in games, but...
Oh well.
Minecraft?
Okay, so...
Okay, Minecraft, so...
Ah...
How do I...
How do I explain it?
Okay, so Minecraft for me, I will say right now, I don't care about the building part of it.
I just don't care about the building.
If I do build something, it's going to look like a freaking box.
And it's going to look messy.
It's going to look like trash.
I'm the kind of person that if I will play Minecraft,
I will be the person that causes trouble.
I will start throwing explosives everywhere.
I will start punching everyone and run away.
I will want to go exploring and kill monsters.
And collect like cool shiny stuff or like heal.
You know, things are hard to kill, but like team up and stuff like that.
But yeah, like the building aspect of Minecraft is just...
Not for me, I just...
I just don't care about that part of the game.
I just don't.
I want to like do funny and cool stuff.
Breddy bear blows up a Jason's house with TNT traps.
Yeah, that is something I would definitely do.
Do you like Terraria?
I've played it a bit here and there.
It was a nice game, but I could never like really fully get into it.
Not that I'm like into Minecraft either.
Like for me, I would only play it with my gen mates, you know?
Like when we get like a server and we can play together,
then I would love to play it with them, you know?
But I'm not into like playing it on my own
because that would just be like really boring for me personally.
Sorry, my brain is getting fried.
Hold on, I also want to check something.
I want to check something.
I know that Strani is supposed to stream pretty soon, I think, right?
If I'm correct, let me check.
Oh yeah, she's going to stream in like six minutes.
She's going to stream in like six minutes.
So I wonder if it would be a good idea if I end the stream here
and I redirect you guys to her stream
because honestly, I want to be in that stream
and be in her chat and listen to her
because she's going to have a really fun stream today.
She's going to be exposing via lore.
She's going to be exposing via lore.
Talk about behind the scenes and all that stuff.
So it's going to be super, super fun.
So I think what I should do right now is I'm going to end the stream.
Please, please don't leave, please don't leave.
Once I end the stream, you will automatically be redirected into Strani's stream
and she'll be talking about all behind the scenes,
all the juicy stuff.
And yeah, I think you will really, really enjoy it.
I know I will and I am in VLR.
So we can both hang out in her chat.
So for I leave, I wanted to say thank you, thank you, thank you so much
for showing up to my stream today.
Thank you for hearing me up for two hours.
I had a lot of fun with you.
Thank you for being so sweet to me.
Thank you for all the kind words
and support.
And I will see you again tomorrow at the same time.
I will be playing Tomb Raider Legends,
which is one of my favorite Tomb Raider games.
I will see you tomorrow.
I'm going to miss you.
Don't miss me too much.
You'll see me again soon.
And let's go.
Let's go to Strani.
Let's go watch her stream.
Bye bye for now.
Bye bye.
