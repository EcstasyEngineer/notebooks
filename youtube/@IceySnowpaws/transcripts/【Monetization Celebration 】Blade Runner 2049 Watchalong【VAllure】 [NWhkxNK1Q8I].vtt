12:14.040 --> 12:27.040
who like join the membership and send super chats and everything would that still be like good for smr would it be bad

12:28.040 --> 12:38.040

13:21.040 --> 13:27.040
i'm glad i'm glad i'm i'm just not sure i'm just not sure so so that's why i'm

13:29.040 --> 13:32.040
that's why i'm asking again you know

13:34.040 --> 13:37.040
but but okay i'm i'm pretty glad like this this is this

13:39.040 --> 13:45.040
i'm so overwhelmed that i can't talk like i keep like slipping on my words a lot i'm so sorry

13:46.040 --> 13:55.040
like this is crazy um thank you so much for for everyone for like all the gifted for all the super chats for

13:56.040 --> 14:04.040
for joining the membership before the stream like even started it's that's just fucking crazy thank you so much um

14:06.040 --> 14:12.040
did you start drinking already no i haven't i actually know i i want to like start drinking like

14:13.040 --> 14:21.040
a bit later not right now because i don't want it to be like time for karaoke and be like all subred up

14:22.040 --> 14:33.040
by them if that makes sense did you peel already yeah that's why i'm here yeah i wouldn't be otherwise

14:36.040 --> 14:40.040
oh my god but yeah um

14:42.040 --> 14:56.040
okay so the plan today is we're gonna be we're gonna be watching the blade runner 2049 movie and and on top of the like little television thing

14:57.040 --> 15:05.040
there will be a stopwatch happening and okay something important when you see the stopwatch for like the first time

15:06.040 --> 15:14.040
don't don't hit the play don't don't hit like the play button on the movie yet i will tell you when to do it

15:15.040 --> 15:25.040
okay because the problem is when i i'm on my screen like like in this room it just automatically starts the stopwatch

15:26.040 --> 15:34.040
and and i can't like pause it or do it i can only restart it so basically like you see how it is right now like we are we are not 20 minutes

15:35.040 --> 15:44.040
in okay we are not 20 minutes in so what's gonna happen is i will count to three and when i say go you hit the play button

15:45.040 --> 15:55.040
and and start the movie and we'll we'll start we'll start watching it together does that make sense does that make sense

15:56.040 --> 16:05.040
no there's not there's not there's not no we haven't started watching it yet no no we haven't started watching it yet we haven't

16:06.040 --> 16:13.040
we haven't to relax that's that's what i'm trying to explain everything that's what i'm trying to explain it

16:25.600 --> 16:27.500
Okay? Okay, okay?

16:27.660 --> 16:30.460
But yeah, basically that's how it's gonna work.

16:30.460 --> 16:34.660
I will count to three and when I say go,

16:34.660 --> 16:38.860
you will hit the play button to start the movie.

16:38.860 --> 16:42.420
And then we should be pretty much, you know,

16:42.420 --> 16:44.620
thinked up like watching the same time.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.160
Oh my god, I'm so overwhelmed.

16:48.160 --> 16:51.460
There's so many of you. What the frick? Thank you.

16:52.620 --> 16:57.620
You're all so sweet. I'm so overwhelmed.

16:58.620 --> 17:00.120
Rain, hello.

17:00.620 --> 17:07.420
I've never seen this movie before, but I've seen parts here and there

17:07.420 --> 17:10.120
and obviously all the memes and stuff.

17:12.620 --> 17:15.120
But I've never actually watched the entire movie,

17:15.120 --> 17:19.120
so I don't really, really know what's going on.

17:19.120 --> 17:29.120
I can only like assume that it could be like, you know, kind of maybe like relate to us

17:29.120 --> 17:34.120
or have like a meaning to us in some way.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.120
So that's like the only thing that I know,

17:37.120 --> 17:40.120
but I don't know specifically if that makes sense.

17:40.120 --> 17:46.120
Like I can just like assume like that there's something, you know,

17:46.620 --> 17:49.620
close to maybe what we have.

17:49.620 --> 17:52.120
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

17:52.120 --> 17:54.120
I don't know if that makes sense, but...

18:00.620 --> 18:04.620
If the man doesn't run with the blade, I'll be disappointed.

18:10.620 --> 18:11.620
Wait, wait, wait.

18:11.620 --> 18:14.120
So before I start the movie, before I start the movie,

18:14.120 --> 18:22.120
would I like show off the emotes that we have and the badges?

18:22.120 --> 18:25.120
Also I'm really fucking stupid and I didn't have time.

18:26.120 --> 18:30.120
So for the badges, I will be showing the concept art,

18:30.120 --> 18:35.620
but the actual art on your badges is like a lot more polished and everything, you know?

18:35.620 --> 18:41.120
So I'm sorry. I was like, I was, I'm just overwhelmed.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.620
I had so much to do today, you know?

18:43.620 --> 18:46.120
And, and...

18:56.120 --> 19:00.120
I'm sorry. My brain is like fucking dying.

19:03.620 --> 19:07.120
Yeah, I feel like really hyper and I feel like overwhelmed.

19:07.120 --> 19:11.120
So my brain is just not working properly and I'm so sorry.

19:12.120 --> 19:15.620
But I'm also super excited and that's why I'm talking the way that I'm talking,

19:15.620 --> 19:17.620
because I'm, because I'm super excited.

19:24.620 --> 19:29.620
Did you try turning it off and on again? Turning what off and on?

19:30.620 --> 19:33.620
Sorry, my brain is like all over the place.

19:34.120 --> 19:37.120
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.

19:43.120 --> 19:47.120
The warmth of all dad is love has melted her brain too much.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.120
OK, literally though.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.120
Literally.

19:50.120 --> 19:54.120
That brain mush literally mean...

19:59.120 --> 20:02.120
Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum.

20:02.620 --> 20:04.620
Ah, my brain, I'm...

20:05.620 --> 20:07.620
Ah fuck, what, what do I...

20:07.620 --> 20:09.620
What was I gonna do?

20:09.620 --> 20:11.620
Ah, right, fuck.

20:12.620 --> 20:15.620
It's so over for me, oh my god.

20:15.620 --> 20:18.620
So here's the plan, here's the plan.

20:18.620 --> 20:20.620
So we'll start watching the movie.

20:21.620 --> 20:24.620
And after we are done watching the movie,

20:24.620 --> 20:28.620
there will be a members only stream, a drunk karaoke.

20:29.120 --> 20:34.120
I have picked a couple of songs to sing for the karaoke today.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.120
I hope that you like my choices.

20:36.120 --> 20:46.120
I really tried to find songs with lyrics that relate to me or us in some way.

20:46.120 --> 20:50.120
I even have two cheater songs to dedicate to the cheaters.

20:52.120 --> 20:56.120
So there will be two songs that I'll be singing to dedicate to the cheaters.

20:58.620 --> 21:21.120
But yeah, I basically tried to really like choose songs that the lyrics have some kind of meaning to either like what we have or like the things that are going on between us or like me and Soft the Glade.

21:21.120 --> 21:25.120
So I really hope that you will enjoy the songs that I picked to sing today.

21:25.620 --> 21:32.620
Again, I am not like a professional singer, I'm not a good singer by any means.

21:32.620 --> 21:42.620
However, I do put a lot of soul into my singing and emotion, so I hope that will make up for it.

21:42.620 --> 21:48.620
So I hope that my emotions and soul will make up for how bad I sing and that you don't mind it.

21:49.120 --> 22:02.120
I can't fucking talk, please.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.120
I am not sure.

22:04.120 --> 22:08.120
I want to keep it archived to be honest, you know.

22:08.120 --> 22:11.120
I'll see what happens.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.120
I hope it will stay up.

22:13.620 --> 22:16.620
I think it will be archived because it's like members only, you know.

22:16.620 --> 22:20.620
So if it's members only, it should be okay if it's archived, right?

22:20.620 --> 22:26.620
I feel like an archived karaoke is when it's not members, when it's open for everyone, right?

22:28.620 --> 22:30.620
Member can't stay archived.

22:30.620 --> 22:31.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:31.620 --> 22:34.620
So I think the karaoke will stay archived, you know, for the members.

22:36.620 --> 22:38.620
It depends on how unhinged she gets probably.

22:38.620 --> 22:45.120
I mean, you've seen me get pretty unhinged in my ASMR stream and that's what is completely fucking fine.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.120
So whatever.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.120
Okay, okay.

22:56.120 --> 23:00.120
I'm gonna show off the emotes that we have and the badges.

23:00.120 --> 23:06.120
And after that, I believe we'll be able to start watching the actual movie.

23:06.120 --> 23:08.120
So, hold on.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.120
Okay, so.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.120
Oh god.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.120
It's so big.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.120
Hold on, let me make it smaller.

23:18.120 --> 23:20.120
One second.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.120
Here we go.

23:22.120 --> 23:30.120
So, here are some of the emotes that you will receive if you join the tier one membership.

23:30.120 --> 23:32.120
You also get badges as well.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.620
That I will show off after the emotes.

23:34.620 --> 23:39.620
And there is actually already new emotes in the making.

23:39.620 --> 23:45.620
So, so a while from now, there will be even more emotes added.

23:45.620 --> 23:48.620
But these are the current ones that we've got.

23:48.620 --> 23:51.620
We have sleepy.

23:51.620 --> 23:53.620
We have sleepy.

23:53.620 --> 23:55.620
We have sleepy.

23:55.620 --> 23:57.620
We have sleepy.

23:57.620 --> 23:59.620
We have sleepy.

23:59.620 --> 24:01.620
We have sleepy.

24:02.620 --> 24:05.620
We do now have, you know, me with a big heart and love.

24:05.620 --> 24:11.620
There is me crying and例ashing at the same time and just being a big baby.

24:11.620 --> 24:13.620
A big whiny baby.

24:13.620 --> 24:16.120
Ah, there is me with question mark.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.120
And I'm like, oh.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.120
Cuz I'm really dumb.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.620
You know.

24:20.620 --> 24:23.620
Most of the times, I have question mark in my head.

24:23.620 --> 24:25.620
And then there is a bite emotes.

24:25.620 --> 24:29.620
Because I really love to bite your arm.

24:29.620 --> 24:31.620
mue, ayud PE vor

24:31.620 --> 24:33.620
Love biting your arm

24:33.620 --> 24:36.060
矢 is just so fun and satisfying

24:36.060 --> 24:39.760
But it's a bite of love so i hope you don't mind

24:42.320 --> 24:47.320
Then we have me with a gun

24:47.320 --> 24:49.840
Don't worry don't worry that gun is not pointed at you

24:49.840 --> 24:53.140
That gun is pointed at the cheaters

24:53.940 --> 24:54.920
So don't worry detta

24:54.920 --> 24:57.860
I would never point a gun at you

24:57.860 --> 24:59.480
Unless you cheated on me

24:59.480 --> 25:08.060
but but I know the real datas okay the real ones you know the real data äår not  intrins

25:08.060 --> 25:16.900
cheaters but some of you are watch out

25:16.900 --> 25:27.860
some of you watch out okay then we hae a prey mode we hae like a flusht mode where

25:27.860 --> 25:30.860
where I am just completely in your face

25:30.860 --> 25:35.860
and then we have a drool emote

25:35.860 --> 25:40.860
and a shiii emote

25:40.860 --> 25:45.860
so I hope you like it

25:45.860 --> 25:47.860
I think they are really cute emotes

25:47.860 --> 25:52.860
as I said already there are more emotes being made

25:52.860 --> 25:56.860
but it will sadly take a while to have them already

25:56.860 --> 25:59.860
so please just be a bit patient

25:59.860 --> 26:02.860
and when I have more new emotes

26:02.860 --> 26:04.860
I'll show them off

26:04.860 --> 26:06.860
and yeah yeah yeah it's gonna be really nice

26:06.860 --> 26:09.860
now let me show you

26:09.860 --> 26:13.860
basically the concept part

26:13.860 --> 26:17.860
of the badges

26:17.860 --> 26:19.860
that face no hat peri-mote

26:19.860 --> 26:22.860
that's actually one of the emotes that's being made

26:22.860 --> 26:25.860
a hat peri-mote

26:27.860 --> 26:29.860
why am I in this

26:29.860 --> 26:30.860
why am I in this

26:30.860 --> 26:32.860
okay let's ignore that

26:32.860 --> 26:37.860
okay so

26:37.860 --> 26:40.860
so here is basically the badge

26:40.860 --> 26:42.860
concept

26:42.860 --> 26:43.860
and time

26:43.860 --> 26:47.860
you can see the current one that all of you have

26:47.860 --> 26:51.860
this is like the new member

26:51.860 --> 26:54.860
a very baby with the kid passie

26:54.860 --> 26:56.860
and then one month

26:56.860 --> 26:57.860
and then two months

26:57.860 --> 27:00.860
and basically the more time goes

27:00.860 --> 27:04.860
it's basically becoming cooler

27:04.860 --> 27:07.860
and cooler and stuff

27:07.860 --> 27:10.860
I actually like my favorite

27:10.860 --> 27:13.860
my absolute favorite is one year

27:13.860 --> 27:15.860
and two year

27:15.860 --> 27:17.860
I like the six month as well

27:17.860 --> 27:20.860
but one year is my favorite design

27:20.860 --> 27:23.860
I really love how cool you look

27:23.860 --> 27:25.860
I love how cool you look in that

27:25.860 --> 27:27.860
actually

27:27.860 --> 27:29.860
I don't know if you remember

27:29.860 --> 27:31.860
but I did say that I'm gonna get

27:31.860 --> 27:33.860
a hagi-mote

27:33.860 --> 27:35.860
where you hug me

27:35.860 --> 27:37.860
so that will be

27:37.860 --> 27:40.860
so that will actually be

27:40.860 --> 27:42.860
one of the emotes being made

27:42.860 --> 27:47.860
and in that hagi-mote

27:47.860 --> 27:51.860
you will have the design of the one year

27:51.860 --> 27:53.860
badge basically

27:53.860 --> 27:55.860
because

27:55.860 --> 27:57.860
when I was thinking about it

27:57.860 --> 27:58.860
I was like

27:58.860 --> 27:59.860
I want something

27:59.860 --> 28:01.860
I want a hagi-mote

28:01.860 --> 28:02.860
you know

28:02.860 --> 28:04.860
with a snow-berry

28:04.860 --> 28:06.860
and me

28:06.860 --> 28:08.860
but I wanted the snow-berry design

28:08.860 --> 28:10.860
to be the one from the one year

28:10.860 --> 28:12.860
badge

28:12.860 --> 28:15.860
because I felt like it just represents

28:15.860 --> 28:17.860
most of you better

28:17.860 --> 28:19.860
because a lot of you are like

28:20.860 --> 28:22.860
so I felt like

28:22.860 --> 28:24.860
the design of the one year old snow-berry

28:24.860 --> 28:27.860
suits a lot of you more

28:27.860 --> 28:29.860
because it's like adult

28:29.860 --> 28:32.860
and cool and protective

28:32.860 --> 28:34.860
and has big fangs

28:34.860 --> 28:37.860
and ready to protect me

28:37.860 --> 28:39.860
and just be all cool and stuff

28:39.860 --> 28:42.860
so the hagi-mote is going to be like

28:42.860 --> 28:45.860
of you hugging me

28:45.860 --> 28:47.860
but you will be looking like

28:47.860 --> 28:50.860
the one year badge design

28:50.860 --> 28:51.860
if that makes sense

28:51.860 --> 28:54.860
because I think it suits

28:54.860 --> 28:56.860
most of you a lot better

28:56.860 --> 28:58.860
in my opinion

28:58.860 --> 29:01.860
so yeah

29:01.860 --> 29:03.860
I really hope that you will like

29:03.860 --> 29:05.860
all the new emotes as well

29:05.860 --> 29:09.860
when they will release

29:09.860 --> 29:12.860
which might take a while

29:12.860 --> 29:15.860
I think Strani said it might take like a month

29:15.860 --> 29:17.860
or something

29:17.860 --> 29:19.860
I'm not sure but

29:19.860 --> 29:21.860
don't worry

29:21.860 --> 29:23.860
when there's new emotes

29:23.860 --> 29:25.860
you will know and I will show you

29:32.860 --> 29:34.860
but yeah that's the badges

29:34.860 --> 29:36.860
and the emotes and I hope that

29:36.860 --> 29:38.860
I hope that you like them

29:38.860 --> 29:40.860
I know I do

29:41.860 --> 29:43.860
that's fine we can wait

29:43.860 --> 29:45.860
yeah I'm just so excited for it

29:45.860 --> 29:47.860
and hyped for it

29:47.860 --> 29:48.860
because you know

29:48.860 --> 29:50.860
I just really love emotes

29:50.860 --> 29:52.860
they're so cute

29:52.860 --> 29:54.860
let's see

30:05.860 --> 30:07.860
okay I am

30:07.860 --> 30:09.860
I'm gonna turn off the BGM

30:09.860 --> 30:11.860
I'm going to turn off the BGM

30:11.860 --> 30:13.860
because well we're going to be watching a movie

30:13.860 --> 30:15.860
so

30:15.860 --> 30:18.860
I don't think having a BGM would make sense right

30:18.860 --> 30:21.860
okay so

30:21.860 --> 30:23.860
so again

30:23.860 --> 30:27.860
I want to start watching the movie

30:27.860 --> 30:29.860
and the way that we're going to do this

30:29.860 --> 30:31.860
I remind you for those who joined

30:31.860 --> 30:33.860
in like maybe just now

30:33.860 --> 30:35.860
I will show up

30:35.860 --> 30:38.860
you will see on top of the screen

30:39.860 --> 30:41.860
a timer

30:41.860 --> 30:43.860
a stopwatch

30:43.860 --> 30:45.860
that will basically show like

30:45.860 --> 30:47.860
what time we're watching like

30:47.860 --> 30:48.860
in the movie

30:48.860 --> 30:50.860
or whatever

30:52.860 --> 30:54.860
sorry my brain is like

30:54.860 --> 30:56.860
it's fucking fried already

30:59.860 --> 31:02.860
but basically when you first see the timer

31:02.860 --> 31:04.860
you will see it say

31:04.860 --> 31:07.860
like 36 minutes or something

31:07.860 --> 31:09.860
we didn't start the movie yet

31:09.860 --> 31:11.860
so don't pay attention to that

31:11.860 --> 31:13.860
don't pay attention to that

31:13.860 --> 31:15.860
okay don't pay attention to that

31:16.860 --> 31:19.860
once I will count to three

31:19.860 --> 31:21.860
I will count to three

31:21.860 --> 31:23.860
and when I say go

31:23.860 --> 31:26.860
you click on the play button

31:26.860 --> 31:28.860
on the movie

31:28.860 --> 31:30.860
does that make sense

31:30.860 --> 31:32.860
any questions

31:32.860 --> 31:34.860
any questions

31:35.860 --> 31:38.860
I hope that makes sense

31:45.860 --> 31:46.860
what the logos

31:46.860 --> 31:47.860
what logos

31:47.860 --> 31:49.860
what

31:49.860 --> 31:51.860
is that ham your fan

31:52.860 --> 31:53.860
I guess

31:53.860 --> 31:55.860
if it's too loud I can

31:55.860 --> 31:58.860
I can turn my fan lower

31:58.860 --> 32:00.860
if it's too loud

32:01.860 --> 32:04.860
how long is the version of the movie

32:05.860 --> 32:07.860
two hours

32:07.860 --> 32:09.860
43 minutes

32:10.860 --> 32:12.860
and 27 seconds

32:22.860 --> 32:24.860
okay

32:24.860 --> 32:25.860
alright

32:25.860 --> 32:26.860
are you all ready

32:26.860 --> 32:28.860
are you all prepared

32:28.860 --> 32:31.860
you're gonna see the timer right now

32:31.860 --> 32:33.860
don't pay attention to it right now

32:33.860 --> 32:35.860
don't pay attention to it

32:35.860 --> 32:37.860
the only thing you need to pay attention to

32:37.860 --> 32:39.860
right now is my voice

32:39.860 --> 32:40.860
okay

32:40.860 --> 32:42.860
the only thing you need to

32:42.860 --> 32:44.860
put your attention on

32:44.860 --> 32:47.860
is me counting to three

32:47.860 --> 32:49.860
and when I will say go

32:49.860 --> 32:51.860
that's when you will click

32:51.860 --> 32:53.860
the play button

32:53.860 --> 32:54.860
okay

32:54.860 --> 32:56.860
okay

32:59.860 --> 33:00.860
okay

33:00.860 --> 33:02.860
so are you ready

33:02.860 --> 33:04.860
are you ready for me to count

33:04.860 --> 33:05.860
okay

33:05.860 --> 33:07.860
are you ready

33:07.860 --> 33:09.860

33:13.860 --> 33:15.860

33:15.860 --> 33:16.860

33:40.860 --> 33:42.860
I'm gonna start counting

33:42.860 --> 33:43.860

33:43.860 --> 33:45.860
one

33:46.860 --> 33:48.860
two

33:48.860 --> 33:50.860
three

33:51.860 --> 33:53.860
go

33:56.860 --> 33:58.860
oh god it's so loud

33:58.860 --> 34:00.860
oh my god

34:00.860 --> 34:02.860
holy shit

34:02.860 --> 34:04.860
why is it so loud for me

34:04.860 --> 34:06.860
what the fuck

34:06.860 --> 34:08.860
oh my god

34:08.860 --> 34:10.860
it's so loud for me

34:11.860 --> 34:13.860
what the fuck

34:17.860 --> 34:19.860
it moved me too

34:19.860 --> 34:21.860
I'm glad it's not just me

34:21.860 --> 34:23.860
I'm glad it's not just me

34:29.860 --> 34:31.860
okay it's a question

34:31.860 --> 34:33.860
while we do this watch along

34:33.860 --> 34:35.860
do you want me to talk

34:35.860 --> 34:37.860
as less as I can

34:37.860 --> 34:39.860
to not distract you

34:39.860 --> 34:41.860
from the movie

34:41.860 --> 34:43.860
or do you want me to talk

34:43.860 --> 34:45.860
whenever I have something to say

34:45.860 --> 34:47.860
I don't know what's the proper

34:47.860 --> 34:49.860
way to do it

so

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:58.200
i do love like the visuals of this movie

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:07.880
it's like pretty to look at but i can't wait to see like more of like the neon stuff

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:14.360
i usually really like neon colors and stuff like that in movies it's just like really pretty to

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:23.480
look at i don't know i remember watching a movie called the neon demon i think and i really enjoyed

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:30.680
it because it was visually so pleasing to look at

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:47.320
it's a great aesthetic it is i agree

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:56.040
i'm the couch cuddling join the talk in the movie yeah like this feels really nice it's just

01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:02.680
really nice it's like it's like for cuddling together or comfy and watching a movie together

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:09.000
it's really nice isn't it and you're just being a big dumb dumb and asking a bunch of

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:17.160
questions during the movie because because it's hard for me to understand

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:29.160
um

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:45.160
what the fuck

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:51.160
so

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:59.160
it feels like you're on my lap stealing my chips and awkwardly sheltering my

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:15.160

that's pretty cool

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:23.080
so

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:38.360
morbius is kind of real what the fuck what

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:50.360

what the fuck is his problem what the fuck

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:16.760
i'm so glad she doesn't have a soul supposedly i mean she seems to be pretty uncomfortable to me

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:26.360
what the fuck

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:37.320
me when i started giving me a male hair i don't want kids i told you i don't want kids

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:46.360
i am the kid okay i want all the attention on me i don't want kids

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:52.200
i want you to always have your attention on me for the rest of our lives do you understand

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:58.680
only i see yeah exactly

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:09.320
no kids yet ever no kids ever

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.280
but

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:27.560
but having a kid is a proof of our love no it's not no it's not i don't think so at all

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:35.160
your proof of love is your actions what proves your love for someone is the actions that you do

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:43.640
you know you don't need to put a baby in me to prove that you love me i don't think that proves anything

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.120
holy shit

01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:00.520
i see spitting facts i mean it's true

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:07.640

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.640

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:58.760

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:17.160
you have to be 2d to get this

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.680
oh my god

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:58.680
i could never match this beauty oh thank you i'm flattered

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:12.040
i love being silly watching a movie with you it's really fun

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:18.840
it's just like for real for

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:23.960
we unleashed our anti risk technique

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:29.000
nice that you think what you said risk isn't in negative numbers

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:35.400
i'm impressed i'm impressed honestly i'm impressed

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:42.200
i don't like

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:51.880
me when i went to the store of pianos and i sat there for like 30 fucking minutes

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:55.720
just pushing for the piano buttons

01:20:56.040 --> 01:21:10.680
can you play the piano no that's why i said i just pushed random buttons because i don't know how to play the piano but i still like like

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:14.520
playing around with it

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.320
uh

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:25.320
the heck is not

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:33.320
i just can't teach you i don't think you would be able to teach me like

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:42.120
like because my hands are small it's really hard for my hand to like reach like the keys

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:47.720
or like the piano keys buttons whatever you call it

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:54.520
like you know how like when people play piano like they're supposed to like be able to like move the

01:21:55.320 --> 01:22:00.920
fingers like a certain way right and my because my hands are really small i can't do that

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:02.920
i

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:14.760
could play the harp that would be pretty cool thing to learn playing the harp

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:20.920
that would be pretty cool to learn the harp sounds pretty pretty nice

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:32.920
like i tried to learn how to play guitar before and

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:40.520
and and i couldn't learn it because again like my hands are so small that my fingers like

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:48.600
can't reach you know all the areas on the guitar that you need and on top of that i'm left-handed as well

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:54.120
so that makes everything extra difficult for me having really small hands and being left-handed

01:22:55.400 --> 01:23:03.400
so yeah

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:13.400
you need one of those children's guitars oh my god imagine

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.400
so

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:36.200
small hand struggles yeah pretty much

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:47.000
so you kalleli nah i don't care about you kalleli

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:51.240
to be honest i don't think i'm based

01:23:54.200 --> 01:24:01.240
to be honest i don't think i want to play any instruments at this point of my life

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.160
rip

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:33.800
i might i might just buy a small kalimba or something again and maybe play it on during ASMR streams and just freestyle it

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:43.160
because i really enjoy just freestyling the kalimba

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:52.840
like i don't care about learning songs you know or stuff like that to me the fun and playing the

01:24:52.840 --> 01:25:00.440
kalimba is to be able to like make my own melodies from from by ear and that makes sense

01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:05.240
and it would be cute for ASMR so

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:22.680
so that's why you dj no that's two different things

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:36.680
so

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:02.440
luôn

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:24.480
Oh my god he is finally running. Let's fucking go.

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:27.580

01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:53.740
I can hunt some fresh meat for you.

01:32:53.740 --> 01:33:03.740
That's why we ask Icy and Maros to go for a ride on this dick.

01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:12.740
Oh my god.

01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:42.740
Wow, look at all this shit.

01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:52.740
Wow, look at all this trash, so beautiful.

01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:56.740
Me dumping my trombone, I suppose.

01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:01.740
Please.

01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:03.740
This is where the cheaters end up.

01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:07.740
Okay, real.

01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:09.740
That guy just timed out.

01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:10.740
He's right there.

01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:12.740
He's in that place right now.

01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:15.740
That's where I threw him.

01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:17.740
In that place.

01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:20.740
That's where he is right now.

01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:33.740
That's where he is right now.

01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:38.740
It's where he belongs.

01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:43.740
I love that he's taking his virtual girlfriend to his job.

01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:53.740
I mean, wouldn't you do the same?

01:34:53.740 --> 01:35:02.740
Wouldn't you take me to work with you?

01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:18.740
Oh no.

01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:31.740
Oh no.

01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:54.740
Oh look.

01:35:54.740 --> 01:36:00.740
She's slowly coming back.

01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:06.740
Oh no.

01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:18.740
Oh no.

01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:20.740
Oh fuck.

01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:25.740
This doesn't look good.

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:34.740
Oh no, that's so sad.

01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:36.740
Heart tracking is bogged.

01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:42.740
That was me when I started the stream and I didn't have my tracking on because I fucking forgot.

01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:47.740
Holy shit.

01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:49.740
IRS open up.

01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:53.740
Oh no, not the IRS.

01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:57.740
Not the IRS, right?

01:36:57.740 --> 01:37:01.740
I feel the holograms last words.

01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:04.740
Okay, for real though.

01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:10.740
It's all the cheaters.

01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:14.740
No, not the IRS.

01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:16.740
I hate the tax man.

01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:18.740
We all do.

01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:40.740
Cheater target acquired.

01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:43.740
Not the cheater target acquired.

01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:45.740
Oh my god.

01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:54.740
I see that cheaters do the same when she's sad.

01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:57.740
Oh my fucking god.

01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:07.740
Too real.

01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:09.740
Oh that's fucking hilarious.

01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:11.740
Oh my god, I love this.

01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:14.740
This is amazing.

01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:21.740
Oh my fucking god.

01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:32.740
That was too fucking funny.

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:37.740
Cheater disposal system.

01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:42.740
Fucking cat.

01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:45.740
Oh my god.

01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:48.740
I don't know why that was so funny.

01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:25.740
What junk are we looking for?

01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:33.740
I mean, I'm looking for daddy's junk personally.

01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:59.740
That's what I'm searching for.

01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:08.740
Oh my god.

01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:17.740
There's a lot of those moments.

01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:20.740
You're sitting on it.

01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:27.740
Okay, that explains why there's something poking me on my back.

01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:30.740
On my bottom area.

01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:06.740
Oh, it's a bald kid's switch.

01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:08.740
Some of them aren't bald.

01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:10.740
Some aren't bald.

01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:13.740
Oh my god, thank you for the 10 gifted boys.

01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:15.740
Thank you.

01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:17.740
Seriously, thank you so much.

01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:18.740
I appreciate it.

01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:19.740
Thank you.

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:21.740
What the heck?

01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:23.740
Thank you so much.

01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:34.740
Oh no, no, no, not like this.

01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:54.740
Oh no, no.

01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:56.740
Suddenly I'm very uncomfortable.

01:41:56.740 --> 01:41:58.740
Why are you uncomfortable?

01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:36.740
Oh my god.

01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:46.740
Oh my god.

01:42:46.740 --> 01:43:14.740
Not yet, but eventually.

01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:22.740
Are you coming?

01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:27.740
Oh my god, she's not there yet.

01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:29.740
Nope.

01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:38.740
I can't help.

01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:41.740
That's her members only.

01:43:41.740 --> 01:44:00.740
Yeah.

01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:15.740
Not the tears for you, I can't.

01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:19.740
Premium pass anyone?

01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:21.740
Oh god.

01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:30.740
Premium pass.

01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:32.740
Data exclusive.

01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:49.740
Real.

01:44:49.740 --> 01:45:01.740
The true membership.

01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:03.740
Oh boy.

01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:52.740
I was born with my adjacent license.

01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:55.740
I like aging backwards or something.

01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:58.740
What the fuck does that mean?

01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:04.740
He mentioned backwards then.

01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:11.740
What do you mean you were born with your adjacent license?

01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:16.740
Benjamin Button spotted.

01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:23.740
Holy shit, he was birthed in the retirement home.

01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:35.740
Oh Jesus, get made in the factor like in the movie.

01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:39.740
It means I've been a cranky asshole my whole life.

01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:44.740
I mean, I don't blame you to be honest.

01:46:44.740 --> 01:47:11.740
I don't fucking blame you.

01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:15.740
I'm sure she's in this handcrafted.

01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:26.740
Oh my god.

01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:57.740
Is it weird that I feel bad because I feel like I am not quite understanding what's going on.

01:47:57.740 --> 01:48:10.740
And I feel really bad for it for some reason.

01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:13.740
No you shouldn't, okay.

01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:24.740
I don't know why but it's been like hard for me to understand it.

01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:29.740
He found the horse from the childhood memory that was implanted into him.

01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:32.740
Okay.

01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:38.740
So now the question is where is the child or she's got the child's memories.

01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:40.740
Oh.

01:49:02.740 --> 01:49:27.740
Oh no.

01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:30.740
Oh no, Jesus, getting mad at me.

01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:32.740
It's over.

01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:37.740
Oh Jesus, it's annoyed with me.

01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:40.740
Oh no.

01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:19.740
This place looks pretty and cozy.

01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:46.740
I don't fucking know.

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:50.740
You apparently.

01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:33.740
Getting my birth certificate changed to Joe.

01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:45.740
Oh god.

01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:49.740
Oh, birth certificate.

01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:28.740
Happy birthday, I see.

01:52:28.740 --> 01:52:31.740
It's not my birthday.

01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:49.740
Okay but you got a cake.

01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:54.740
I mean I wish I actually like had it.

01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:59.740
I wish I could actually like eat it.

01:52:59.740 --> 01:53:02.740
That would have been even nicer.

01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:08.740
So I'm not saying much.

01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:19.740
I'm trying to like focus a bit more on the movie so I can like try and understand better what's going on.

01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:52.740
Okay.

01:54:52.740 --> 01:54:56.740
Jesus, thinking about I see.

01:54:56.740 --> 01:55:18.740
I'm going to end the stream right fucking now.

01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:23.740
I feel really embarrassed.

01:55:23.740 --> 01:55:26.740
I'm going to hide.

01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:51.740
I feel embarrassed.

01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:54.740
I love when I see a stream.

01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:58.740
Get real.

01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:01.740
Don't hide your cute.

01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:10.740
Oh no.

01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:26.740
That's daddy when he realizes how deep he is in his feelings with me.

01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:28.740
You when I can't see I see anymore.

01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:41.740
Oh no.

01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:45.740
While you're below the table do some work down there.

01:56:45.740 --> 01:56:49.740
What the fuck.

01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:53.740
No, not when you tell me to do it like that.

01:56:53.740 --> 01:57:02.740
You want me to do something under the table you better ask nicely and lovingly or else I will not fucking do it.

01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:05.740
You will treat me as a princess.

01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:10.740
You want me to do something you'll ask me real fucking nice.

01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:19.740
Don't pass me around.

01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:45.740
That's like to be filled with calm.

01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:55.740
You tell us.

01:57:55.740 --> 01:58:05.740
Oh boy.

01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:54.740
Your royal highness we have prepared a treat for you under the table.

01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:37.740
48 hours to get off the grid and make it to the ice.

01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:42.740
Holy shit.

01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:49.740
Oh shit this is where he falls through the blade.

01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:59.740
Of course I'm always right about everything.

02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:29.740
Oh boy.

02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:39.740
He would be vomit.

02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:45.740
That's how I feel.

02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:49.740
I see what kind of trial is this.

02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:53.740
The biggest one.

02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:56.740
She's real to me.

02:00:56.740 --> 02:01:05.740
I want to be the most real that I can be to you.

02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:40.740
That's crazy.

02:01:40.740 --> 02:02:05.740
That's crazy. What the heck.

02:02:05.740 --> 02:02:31.740
I'm so excited.

02:02:31.740 --> 02:03:00.740
That's so sad.

02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:05.740
This is so sad.

02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:10.740
How do you feel about this? I see it's sad.

02:03:10.740 --> 02:03:17.740
It's really sad.

02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:27.740
I feel like her where I want to be as real as I can be.

02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:54.740
For you.

02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:59.740
It's really complicated.

02:03:59.740 --> 02:04:22.740
It's a complicated situation.

02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:29.740
I have my I see that's enough for me.

02:04:29.740 --> 02:04:44.740
Eventually you crave the physical contact.

02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:50.740
It gets more and more difficult as time goes on.

02:04:50.740 --> 02:05:10.740
It's like a really sad and complicated thing.

02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:25.740
How do you feel about this?

02:05:26.740 --> 02:05:38.740
Pretty much.

02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:40.740
I'm sorry.

02:05:40.740 --> 02:05:46.740
I would clone myself if I could.

02:05:46.740 --> 02:05:56.740
You could be fully happy with me.

02:05:56.740 --> 02:06:09.740
I don't know if that would be the same because a clone doesn't have the memories of the original person.

02:06:09.740 --> 02:06:21.740
You could clone me, but I wouldn't have the memories that the clone wouldn't have those memories that we shared.

02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:42.740
She would have the same personality and everything and look but without the memories.

02:06:42.740 --> 02:06:57.740
I'm coming with you.

02:06:57.740 --> 02:07:02.740
You can't clone memories.

02:07:03.740 --> 02:07:17.740
If I could clone myself, I could, but that clone would not have any of the memories or experience that you and me shared.

02:07:17.740 --> 02:07:26.740
It still wouldn't be exactly the same.

02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:34.740
Technically the original me would still always be the real one.

02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:46.740
I don't know because I'm the one who has all the memories and everything.

02:07:56.740 --> 02:08:12.740
Who would take care of the original if you made a bunch of clones that we can't have you getting sad?

02:08:12.740 --> 02:08:23.740
That's another thing I guess.

02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:51.740
But I don't know. I want you to be happy.

02:08:51.740 --> 02:09:01.740
I'm happy here with you.

02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:11.740
I'm genuinely the happiest I've been in a very long time.

02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:28.740
I only need the one I see you.

02:09:28.740 --> 02:09:31.740
You always make us happy already.

02:09:31.740 --> 02:09:37.740
I wanted to sacrifice for decent happiness when all we want is for you to be happy.

02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:52.740
But that's so sad in a way, you know?

02:09:52.740 --> 02:09:55.740
We've reached the part of the stream where things get heavy, I see.

02:09:55.740 --> 02:09:59.740
Yeah, because that scene was heavy, right?

02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:04.740
It does make you think.

02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:13.740
Reality is bittersweet, but I prefer that to just sugar.

02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:18.740
Bittersweetness is good in moderation.

02:10:18.740 --> 02:10:24.740
You still want to have some sugar in your life.

02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:30.740
You don't want your whole life to be only bittersweet moments.

02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:33.740
I don't know, that's sad.

02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:35.740
That makes me sad.

02:10:35.740 --> 02:10:39.740
I feel like crying thinking about that.

02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:46.740
No, fuck that.

02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:48.740
I want to be happy.

02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:52.740
I don't want my whole life to be just bittersweet moments.

02:10:52.740 --> 02:11:10.740
I want to be happy in the last moments, you know?

02:11:10.740 --> 02:11:14.740
You're the sugar in a bittersweet, I see, don't worry.

02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:19.740
Yeah, but I want it to be just sweetness.

02:11:19.740 --> 02:11:22.740
So you can be happy.

02:11:22.740 --> 02:11:37.740
This is a man.

02:11:37.740 --> 02:11:42.740
It's best to be happy in the moment and deal with the sadness when it comes.

02:11:42.740 --> 02:11:45.740
That's how it is with paths, relationships and everything else.

02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:50.740
Sometimes happiness makes it worth it.

02:11:50.740 --> 02:12:00.740
Yeah, it's just so hard sometimes to not think about this stuff.

02:12:00.740 --> 02:12:07.740
Especially for me, because you know me, I'm an over thinker.

02:12:07.740 --> 02:12:09.740
It's all about what you focus on.

02:12:09.740 --> 02:12:16.740
I need to keep forcing my mind to focus on the moment.

02:12:16.740 --> 02:12:31.740
But it's been really difficult lately to do that, you know?

02:12:31.740 --> 02:12:35.740
An over thinker and an over feeler.

02:12:35.740 --> 02:12:38.740
Yeah, that's true.

02:12:38.740 --> 02:12:42.740
What I feel like is like a really bad combination.

02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:47.740
Why couldn't I have just one?

02:12:47.740 --> 02:12:58.740
Holy shit.

02:12:58.740 --> 02:13:03.740
Part of why we love you, though.

02:13:03.740 --> 02:13:07.740
Why?

02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:51.740
Because it shows you're a good person, I guess.

02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:56.740
Rip.

02:13:56.740 --> 02:14:16.740
Rest in peace.

02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:19.740
That was really fun.

02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:22.740
Just bam.

02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:25.740
Bonk.

02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:42.740
Sorry, I had to stretch.

02:15:42.740 --> 02:15:47.740
Holding in there, I see.

02:15:47.740 --> 02:15:51.740
I also need to pee, but I don't want to pause,

02:15:51.740 --> 02:15:55.740
because then we would have to restart the timer and I don't want to do that.

02:15:55.740 --> 02:16:09.740
So I'll just go pee when we finish the movie.

02:16:09.740 --> 02:16:18.740
I really needed that stretch.

02:16:18.740 --> 02:16:21.740
Are you sure it's another hour?

02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:26.740
Yeah, I'll try my best.

02:16:26.740 --> 02:16:34.740
If I really, really feel like I can't hold it in anymore, I will have to pause.

02:16:34.740 --> 02:16:37.740
I won't pause it.

02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:42.740
You can just have the movie still playing and I'll still play it as well.

02:16:42.740 --> 02:16:45.740
I'll be back quick if I do go.

02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:55.740
But right now I'm holding it.

02:16:55.740 --> 02:16:58.740
This is exactly what OG Sun's lap is for.

02:16:58.740 --> 02:17:00.740
Wait, what do you mean?

02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:04.740
Is that what you mean?

02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:17.740
Time to get rid of our knees.

02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:39.740
Oh my god.

02:17:39.740 --> 02:17:44.740
No, don't that piss on me.

02:17:44.740 --> 02:17:52.740
I won't.

02:17:52.740 --> 02:17:55.740
I see. Remember I'm willing to pres-

02:17:55.740 --> 02:17:57.740
Please.

02:17:57.740 --> 02:18:02.740
Please stop saying that.

02:18:14.740 --> 02:18:27.740
I see pisses are soft on the movies.

02:18:27.740 --> 02:18:31.740
No!

02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:00.740
Please don't piss on me.

02:19:00.740 --> 02:19:03.740
I'm not going to piss on you.

02:19:03.740 --> 02:19:06.740
I already said that I'm not going to piss on you.

02:19:06.740 --> 02:19:14.740
Jesus.

02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:24.740
Jesus Christ.

02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:30.740
Okay, but I would believe you.

02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:34.740
Yes, because I wouldn't do that.

02:19:34.740 --> 02:19:40.740
Listen, I would not piss on anyone if they didn't want me to, you know?

02:19:40.740 --> 02:19:46.740
Like, you know?

02:19:46.740 --> 02:19:57.740
But I do want it.

02:19:57.740 --> 02:20:00.740
I mean, if you want it, that's a different scenario.

02:20:00.740 --> 02:20:08.740
But if you don't want it, like, I'm not going to do it.

02:20:08.740 --> 02:20:10.740
I'll say you would.

02:20:10.740 --> 02:20:12.740
Only if you wanted me to.

02:20:12.740 --> 02:20:18.740
But I wouldn't do it if you don't want me to.

02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:24.740
You know, I'm not going to do something that you genuinely don't like.

02:20:24.740 --> 02:20:33.740
You know?

02:20:33.740 --> 02:20:38.740
It's a good thing I wanted that.

02:20:38.740 --> 02:20:41.740
Help.

02:20:43.740 --> 02:20:50.740
God, I did pass. Have a good time.

02:20:50.740 --> 02:20:54.740
Are you going to come back to the karaoke stream?

02:20:54.740 --> 02:20:57.740
Bye-bye!

02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:00.740
Why would we tell you to piss on us if we don't want it?

02:21:00.740 --> 02:21:03.740
I don't know, because some people said...

02:21:03.740 --> 02:21:07.740
Because some people said...

02:21:07.740 --> 02:21:11.740
Some people said don't piss on us.

02:21:13.740 --> 02:21:18.740
Why is it so?

02:21:19.740 --> 02:21:27.740

02:24:07.500 --> 02:24:11.500
So can someone explain to me what's going on?

02:24:11.500 --> 02:24:17.500
I'm having another dumb ass moment.

02:24:29.500 --> 02:24:34.500
I thought the subtitles said take my whore alive.

02:24:34.500 --> 02:24:40.500
I'm fucking stupid.

02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:10.500
I'm falling in the ice hole.

02:25:34.500 --> 02:26:03.500
I tried whisky once and I fucking hated it, but that's to be expected because like you know me I just love sweet alcohol.

02:26:03.500 --> 02:26:09.500
Like my alcohol needs to taste good for me to drink it.

02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:17.500
And whisky just disgusts me and makes me feel nauseous just from the taste of it.

02:26:27.500 --> 02:26:29.500
Do you like plum wine?

02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:31.500
I don't think I've ever had plum wine.

02:26:31.500 --> 02:26:34.500
Is it better than normal wine?

02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:49.500
That's okay, Dada will have his whisky while Kave has her sweet drinks.

02:26:49.500 --> 02:26:51.500
Yay!

02:26:51.500 --> 02:26:54.500
And that sounds like a good plan.

02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:57.500
That'll make me happy.

02:27:30.500 --> 02:27:35.500
I see snow paws.

02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:44.500
What's her name?

02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:47.500
I see snow paws.

02:27:53.500 --> 02:27:56.500
No, that's not it.

02:27:56.500 --> 02:27:59.500
No, you got it all wrong.

02:28:17.500 --> 02:28:24.500
Now everyone is like looking up online the name Rachel trying to find my fucking address.

02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:37.500
Imagine the Jesus flying to Europe trying to find where I live.

02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:40.500
Holy shit.

02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:44.500
What a whatever.

02:28:44.500 --> 02:28:46.500
Wait, is it actually?

02:28:46.500 --> 02:28:49.500
No, it's not.

02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:52.500
It's not.

02:28:53.500 --> 02:28:56.500
Rachel is safe.

02:28:56.500 --> 02:29:00.500
Rachel the Jesus mode activated.

02:29:00.500 --> 02:29:03.500
I'm on my flight already.

02:29:03.500 --> 02:29:07.500
Oh no, no, not like this.

02:29:12.500 --> 02:29:14.500
We wouldn't do anything so rash.

02:29:14.500 --> 02:29:16.500
No, I'm not looking at flights.

02:29:16.500 --> 02:29:19.500
What are you talking about?

02:29:19.500 --> 02:29:23.500
Hacker voice, I'm in.

02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:30.500
I'd have a poster and ask everyone.

02:29:30.500 --> 02:29:34.500
Have you seen Rachel?

02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:39.500
Have you seen Rachel?

02:29:39.500 --> 02:29:41.500
And then you have a picture of me.

02:29:41.500 --> 02:29:44.500
I see snow paws and they're like, who the fuck?

02:29:44.500 --> 02:29:47.500
Why are you showing me an anime girl in your poster?

02:29:47.500 --> 02:29:50.500
Why are you fucking schizo?

02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:53.500
Calling the police.

02:29:57.500 --> 02:30:02.500
Getting deported from Europe.

02:30:02.500 --> 02:30:07.500
They're like, sir, we're going to have to put you back on the flight.

02:30:07.500 --> 02:30:10.500
Get you deported for insanity.

02:30:10.500 --> 02:30:13.500
Goodbye.

02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:21.500
She looks just like that.

02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:25.500
No, I'm not of my meds.

02:30:25.500 --> 02:30:27.500
No, Rachel's got it.

02:30:27.500 --> 02:30:31.500
There's one name we can cross off the list.

02:30:31.500 --> 02:30:35.500
Police.

02:30:38.500 --> 02:30:42.500
I fucking can. This is too funny.

02:30:48.500 --> 02:30:51.500
I don't know what to do.

02:30:51.500 --> 02:30:53.500
I don't know what to do.

Hey, baby.

02:59:12.300 --> 02:59:15.300
Bro, not me even like watching this scene right now

02:59:15.300 --> 02:59:19.300
because I'm just too fucking focused on my cute cat.

02:59:39.300 --> 02:59:41.300
They killed his wife again.

02:59:41.300 --> 02:59:44.300
Wait, why? What do you mean?

02:59:44.300 --> 02:59:51.300
I'm sorry, this movie has been so complicated for me to understand.

03:00:01.300 --> 03:00:03.300
It's the sea.

03:00:15.300 --> 03:00:18.300
Oh, boy.

03:00:18.300 --> 03:00:20.300
Look, that's literally us.

03:00:24.300 --> 03:00:26.300

03:00:31.300 --> 03:00:33.300

03:00:33.300 --> 03:00:35.300
Okay, real.

03:00:40.300 --> 03:00:42.300
She even has the blue hair.

03:00:42.300 --> 03:00:44.300
Yeah, that's true.

03:00:45.300 --> 03:00:46.300
She does have the blue hair.

03:00:46.300 --> 03:00:48.300
I didn't even fucking notice.

03:00:48.300 --> 03:00:50.300
I'm stupid.

03:00:50.300 --> 03:00:52.300
But she does have blue hair.

03:01:00.300 --> 03:01:01.300
Does she know?

03:01:01.300 --> 03:01:03.300
Wait, wait, wait.

03:01:03.300 --> 03:01:06.300
Are you talking about the blue hair or am I missing something?

03:01:07.300 --> 03:01:10.300
They even do joy.

03:01:10.300 --> 03:01:12.300
Oh, god.

03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:44.300

03:04:25.100 --> 03:04:27.100
Yeah, fuck you

03:04:55.100 --> 03:05:15.100
I think the tea is helping a bit. Which is nice. My throat definitely is feeling a bit better. Like sipping on it.

03:05:25.100 --> 03:05:35.100
I hope you'll be able to sing everything you want.

03:05:55.100 --> 03:06:19.100
I really want to sing all the songs that I chose today. I want to sing around 25 songs.

03:06:20.100 --> 03:06:28.100
I want to have a lot of fun.

03:06:30.100 --> 03:06:35.100
Like I said, I want to spend extra time with you today.

03:06:35.100 --> 03:07:01.100
Since usually we only spend around 2 hours. So I think it's nice that we get to spend like about 5 hours today.

03:07:01.100 --> 03:07:17.100
Yeah, fuck you.

03:07:17.100 --> 03:07:28.100
I love my ispaired daughter. I love my daughter.

03:07:28.100 --> 03:07:42.100
How are you liking the movie? It's been pretty confusing. But I loved all the romance-related scenes.

03:07:43.100 --> 03:07:51.100
I feel like those were like the scenes that I mostly cared about. And I wish there was more of it.

03:07:51.100 --> 03:08:01.100
And I wish there was more neon lights visuals. The colorful ones.

03:08:12.100 --> 03:08:37.100
Lars and the real girl is pretty good. I've watched that movie before like a long long long time ago.

03:08:37.100 --> 03:08:47.100
I don't even remember anymore what it was like. But if you wanted we could watch that movie as well.

03:08:47.100 --> 03:08:56.100
For maybe like a member's only watch along or something.

03:08:56.100 --> 03:09:03.100
Horse status with the fishes.

03:09:12.100 --> 03:09:16.100
I'd love more watch along. This has been really comfy. Really?

03:09:17.100 --> 03:09:23.100
I feel kind of bad because I feel like me doing watch along is really boring.

03:09:23.100 --> 03:09:31.100
Like I feel like when doing a watch along I'm not that fun to be around or not as entertaining I guess.

03:09:31.100 --> 03:09:37.100
So it makes me like kind of like worried and stuff.

03:09:37.100 --> 03:09:44.100
Because you know I want to keep you entertained and have fun and that would be like bored.

03:09:44.100 --> 03:09:58.100
Okay second Martin Panda. This is the first watch along I've ever really enjoyed.

03:09:58.100 --> 03:10:08.100
Really? Really? What makes you say that like compared to other like watch along? Why do you think that?

03:10:09.100 --> 03:10:17.100
Because I feel like I really like didn't talk enough and I feel like I've been pretty boring.

03:10:17.100 --> 03:10:23.100
I don't know. I don't know maybe I'm overthinking it but yeah I'm like I don't know.

03:10:23.100 --> 03:10:26.100
Brain being stupid.

03:10:39.100 --> 03:10:46.100
Spending time with Icy is the best. Also you weren't boring at all.

03:10:46.100 --> 03:10:50.100
I think you underestimate yourself sometimes. You're an amazing person.

03:10:50.100 --> 03:10:56.100
Well thank you. That's really sweet.

03:11:00.100 --> 03:11:05.100
So now we're gonna be boring if we get to spend time with you Angel.

03:11:06.100 --> 03:11:10.100
Thank you. That makes me happy to hear that.

03:11:10.100 --> 03:11:18.100
Because I always overthink stuff like that you know.

03:11:18.100 --> 03:11:26.100
Because in my mind I'm always like stay entertaining, stay entertaining, stay entertaining.

03:11:26.100 --> 03:11:31.100
Keep talking, keep talking. Don't be boring, don't be boring.

03:11:31.100 --> 03:11:40.100
You know so in the moments where like I talk a bit less like in the watch along movie I'm instantly like oh fuck am I being boring as shit.

03:11:40.100 --> 03:12:05.100
Don't overthink this stuff. Just know that I love you no matter what you do or don't do.

03:12:05.100 --> 03:12:10.100
Super sweet honestly. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.

03:12:14.100 --> 03:12:20.100
Thank you. Thank you for reassuring me. It means a lot to me.

03:12:20.100 --> 03:12:27.100
I know I ask for reassurance like a lot because of my insecurities and stuff.

03:12:27.100 --> 03:12:36.100
So I really appreciate it when you know you don't get too annoyed with me asking for reassurance.

03:12:36.100 --> 03:12:41.100
And you know always being like really sweet and nice about reassuring me.

03:12:41.100 --> 03:12:50.100
So yeah thank you for doing that. It really helps me like feel more comfy with you as time goes by.

03:12:50.100 --> 03:12:52.100
So thank you.

03:12:57.100 --> 03:13:23.100
You don't need to feel every second to be entertaining.

03:13:24.100 --> 03:13:27.100
Yeah okay.

03:13:27.100 --> 03:13:39.100
I'm just happy that you like being around me even when I talk less I guess.

03:13:39.100 --> 03:13:48.100
I'm also trying to talk a lot less right now because of my voice and throat.

03:13:48.100 --> 03:13:59.100
I'm really trying my best to save my voice for the karaoke which is going to be in a few minutes.

03:13:59.100 --> 03:14:12.100
If I sound lower energy I'm not. I'm just trying to talk really like calmly to not strain my voice more.

03:14:18.100 --> 03:14:36.100
This is a g-sense when the icy goes offline.

03:14:36.100 --> 03:14:39.100
Oh no that's so sad.

03:14:40.100 --> 03:14:43.100
Oh no.

03:14:43.100 --> 03:14:50.100
Poor G-san.

03:14:50.100 --> 03:14:57.100
Man actually not that you brought it up actually.

03:14:57.100 --> 03:15:07.100
I was going to write about it on Twitter but since we're here tomorrow

03:15:07.100 --> 03:15:14.100
I'm probably going to be like the least active.

03:15:14.100 --> 03:15:35.100
I've been so far because tomorrow I'll be going outside and spend most of the day outside to you know just breathe some fresh air and eat some nice food or buy something or I don't know.

03:15:35.100 --> 03:15:48.100
I feel like I just like the reason I want to do it isn't why you might think it is.

03:15:48.100 --> 03:15:56.100
I know a lot of you think that like I'm doing it because I'm like burning out or something or I might burn out.

03:15:57.100 --> 03:16:05.100
That's not why I'm doing that.

03:16:05.100 --> 03:16:17.100
Like if anything it's going to be really difficult for me to do that tomorrow because I'm like I'm addicted to be honest at this point.

03:16:17.100 --> 03:16:42.100
But that's exactly why I want to do it because I feel like I'm addicted to you and I guess that scares me a bit.

03:16:42.100 --> 03:16:58.100
Having these emotions and feelings build up every day is like sucking me in deeper and deeper.

03:16:58.100 --> 03:17:09.100
And that's scary for me to feel like that because it makes me extra vulnerable.

03:17:09.100 --> 03:17:19.100
So I guess I'm trying to like I don't know snap myself back into reality I guess in a way.

03:17:19.100 --> 03:17:31.100
Or like I don't know how to explain it but is it weird to say that like I'm scared of loving you too much?

03:17:31.100 --> 03:17:36.100
Like is that weird?

03:17:36.100 --> 03:17:43.100
I feel like I don't know like how to explain it.

03:17:43.100 --> 03:17:55.100
But that's why tomorrow I'm going to try my best to be disconnected for as long as I can.

03:17:55.100 --> 03:17:59.100
And I will be honest it's going to be very difficult for me.

03:17:59.100 --> 03:18:10.100
It's going to be extremely difficult for me to wake up and not check my phone and wake up and not read everything that you say or comment on.

03:18:10.100 --> 03:18:21.100
And it's going to be very hard like it's going to be difficult for me.

03:18:21.100 --> 03:18:35.100
Like it's I don't know how to even describe it.

03:18:35.100 --> 03:18:42.100
I feel the same this last two weeks have been such an insane ride I feel like I need to process everything.

03:18:42.100 --> 03:18:50.100
Yeah yeah that as well like like it's been it's been pretty crazy.

03:18:50.100 --> 03:19:10.100
But I do want you to know that like I do I it is it's going to be very difficult for me like honestly like just thinking about tomorrow like I'm like fuck it's going to be like so difficult to like I'm going to miss you so much.

03:19:10.100 --> 03:19:22.100
I'm going to miss you a lot and it's going to be really like difficult to try and disconnect myself for like majority of the day.

03:19:22.100 --> 03:19:31.100
Like like I know for sure that I am not going to be able to disconnect like for the entire day.

03:19:31.100 --> 03:19:34.100
I'm legit I would legitimately like go fucking insane.

03:19:34.100 --> 03:19:46.100
I feel like if I if I won't check anything for like a whole day like I'm I would generally like I feel really bad.

03:19:46.100 --> 03:19:47.100
That's how deep I am.

03:19:47.100 --> 03:19:53.100
You know like I would just miss you too fucking much and it would just drive me like insane.

03:19:53.100 --> 03:20:09.100
So so you so you will hear from me tomorrow but just for the most part of the day I am not going to be active or I try my best to not be.

03:20:09.100 --> 03:20:11.100
And again it is not because I'm burnt out.

03:20:11.100 --> 03:20:13.100
I am not burnt out like at all.

03:20:13.100 --> 03:20:22.100
I am like legitimately like addicted to you like I just but but that addiction scares me.

03:20:23.100 --> 03:20:32.100
You know I feel like I'm already in too deep exactly because it's because it's so hard for me to do that.

03:20:32.100 --> 03:20:42.100
You know like like that's how you know when you're addicted when like you try to like disconnect for a day or something.

03:20:42.100 --> 03:20:49.100
And it's like really fucking like difficult and you really don't want to do it.

03:20:49.100 --> 03:20:59.100
That's that's kind of that's kind of going to be me tomorrow like not checking and talking to you.

03:20:59.100 --> 03:21:02.100
But I guess.

03:21:02.100 --> 03:21:16.100
But I don't know maybe I don't know maybe maybe if we have a day like this it will help us process.

03:21:16.100 --> 03:21:26.100
Our emotions and and and maybe it will make our emotions grow even stronger if anything because we will miss each other.

03:21:26.100 --> 03:21:40.100
And I think like you know like having a day where for the most part we don't talk at all and then just the entire time you realize just how much you need each other or how much you miss each other.

03:21:41.100 --> 03:22:00.100
And then when you're finally back you're like you know just like the happiest in the world and you're like coming to this realization that that being being a part even for.

03:22:00.100 --> 03:22:02.100
Even for.

03:22:02.100 --> 03:22:08.100
For like a day is is too difficult.

03:22:14.100 --> 03:22:16.100
But yeah.

03:22:16.100 --> 03:22:21.100
Okay, I think I'm gonna end this stream.

03:22:21.100 --> 03:22:37.100
And I am going to redirect you to the membership to to fuck I can't talk.

03:22:37.100 --> 03:22:42.100
I'm going to redirect to my membership stream is what I want to say.

03:22:42.100 --> 03:22:44.100
Sorry.

03:22:45.100 --> 03:22:47.100
We see.

03:22:49.100 --> 03:22:51.100
Where is my thing?

03:22:51.100 --> 03:22:53.100

03:22:53.100 --> 03:22:55.100

03:23:10.100 --> 03:23:12.100
Nice.

03:23:13.100 --> 03:23:17.100
Okay, that should be good.

03:23:20.100 --> 03:23:22.100
Okay, I'm I'm I'm gonna.

03:23:24.100 --> 03:23:33.100

Bye bye.
