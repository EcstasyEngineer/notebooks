00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Hi, my snow fairy is doing today. Have you had a good day?

60
00:08:37,440 --> 00:09:02,440
Now I see you sound great, okay okay okay, I guess I'll trust you and if for some reason it is to quiet, I can always try and make myself louder next ASMR stream

61
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:20,440
How long are you planning to be live for today? Probably the usual 2 hours I think

62
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:56,440
I don't have too many triggers at the moment, so we are just gonna have to make do with what we've got

63
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:05,440
Which is not much, but hopefully good enough for all the snow fairies in here

64
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:24,440
I came live just the day from my lunch break, well hopefully you don't fall asleep on your lunch break, that wouldn't be good, wouldn't?

65
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:44,440
You're talking this amazing ASMR, really? Thank you, I'm very flattered

66
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,440
This is suddenly popping sounds

67
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,440
If you're gonna tap with nails on things you have infinite triggers, that is true

68
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:40,440
I woke up for this, but I'm about to fall asleep again this way this day

69
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:53,440
See, I don't blame you sometimes, I watch ASMR in the morning when I wake up and then I'm like okay, going back to sleep, goodnight

70
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:13,440
It's been so long since I've done ASMR, I feel like an opal of weekend

71
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:29,440
In advance, I apologize for any background sounds, you will hear this apartment is very bad for 3DO havers like me

72
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,440
I'm feeling better already

73
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:53,440
The background noise makes it more cozy, maybe for now, but sometimes you will hear stuff like motorcycles or people talking

74
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,440
That's when it gets kind of annoying

75
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:28,440
As nervous as he may be about it, all I see manage to soothe us instantly

76
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:37,440
The first head of your whisper was like magic, yay, I'm glad to hear that, thank you

ASMR

78
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:09,440
No, there will be no pieces of ASMR, I'm not trying to get in trouble

79
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:19,440
I want to try to keep it comfy and cozy

80
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:28,440
I don't think a busy is comfy or cozy

81
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:36,440
I don't know if it's just not the way that I see it, that's for some other stuff

82
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,440
Good idea for a pageant, I don't know about that

83
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:51,440
I feel like they're probably against it, to be honest, they have so many rules

84
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:19,440
I will never do that, I'm not going to do that on the microphone, I'm not trying to break out the stupid book

85
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Book

86
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,440
Can we request triggers normally?

87
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Some days I would say yes, but since right now, I don't have a lot of triggers

88
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:53,440
You're just going to have to enjoy what I have to offer for now, until I can buy some more

89
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:04,440
I'm not sure what it is with ear licking, I think if you do ear licking, but you don't breathe

90
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:14,440
I'm not sure what it is with ear licking, I think if you do ear licking, but you don't breathe, then it's supposed to be okay

91
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:24,440
But if you do ear licks and you breathe, then it's some bad thing

92
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Am I supposed to just die and not breathe when I do ASMR with the egg?

93
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Can the heart beat?

94
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was actually planning on doing it

95
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,440
I'm nervous, don't judge my heart beat, please

96
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,440
Please don't, thank you

97
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:26,440
Oh god, I'm nervous, I'm nervous

98
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,440
Hopefully you can hear my heartbeat, okay?

99
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,440
Okay, I'm not wearing a shirt, so there should be no sad break

100
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Blood ginkgo cheese on from hearing my heartbeat

101
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Can you hear my heart?

102
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:41,440
I can hear it a little bit, sorry

103
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:53,440
Oh god, you probably hear that from outside, I know

104
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:14,440
I don't know why I'm so nervous

105
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:23,440
I guess because when I do ASMR, I want it to be as good and nice as possible

106
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:34,440
So basically every small sound I start over thinking, get worried

107
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,440
That it's gonna be bad

108
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,440
I think we're really great, I see, don't worry, thank you

109
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,440
If you burp really loudly when a car drives by, we won't notice

110
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,440
I don't want to burp, I prefer not to

111
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,440
I try to avoid doing that

112
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,440
That's why sometimes you hear me hiccup instead or a crackle or something

113
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:22,440
I was sitting in a weird position, so my leg is like

114
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,440
kind of uncomfortable, so I needed to stretch

115
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,440
Will this stream be available afterwards?

116
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:41,440
I generally don't know, I generally don't know up to YouTube

117
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:50,440
I see your heart was trying to beat faster, it's because I'm nervous

118
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,440
I don't know, I don't know

119
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,440

123
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:34,440
I wonder what YouTube's stance on your biting

124
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,440
I was thinking it would be cute if I bit your ears

125
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,440
Because I don't know if you remember, but I like to bite sometimes

126

00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,440
I'm so sorry about that.

161
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,440
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

162
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,440
I'm sorry.

163
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,440
I can mute if you would like me to.

164
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,440
By the way, should I mute?

165
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,440
Should I mute?

166
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
No muting allowed.

167
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Why not?

168
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,440
Can you whisper singing your favorite song?

169
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
Umm...

170
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,440
I can't even think of a favorite song right now, to be honest with you.

171
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,440
I like your voice. Thank you, I'm glad.

172
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,440
Dog got a bit too excited.

173
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,440
I'm sorry.

174
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,440
I know what I could do.

175
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,440
I remember I wanted to give you a hug.

176
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
Come here.

177
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
Let me give you a hug.

178
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,440
I'll tell you thank you for working so hard and supporting me, okay?

179
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,440
Come here.

180
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
Come here.

181
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,440
Hug, hug, hug, hug.

182
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,440
Hug, hug, hug, hug.

183
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,440
Maybe I can give some hugs to you, I don't know.

184
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
It depends.

185
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,440
And if you like my hugs.

186
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,440
Hug.

187
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,440

00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,840
it's just on your tapping

194
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,840
tapping on your ears

195
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,840
I feel like

196
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,840
I feel like a big ASMR noob

197
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,840
I used to

198
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,840
have so many different triggers and

199
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
I feel like

200
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,840
I can't have nothing

201
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840

202
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,840
okay, let's do

203
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,840
shh

204
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,840
your voice is the best trigger

205
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,840
I don't know about that

206
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,840
but thank you

207
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,840
I see as the trigger

208
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
I don't know, I don't know

209
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,840

00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,240
I'm sorry, I'm being silly

214
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,240
do not know

215
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,240
I thought I would give you a quick

216
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
like on your ears

217
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240

stick stuff

00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
snow berries, eras

263
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,040
and make sure they stay clean

264
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
because

265
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040

266
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,040

But I don't know how long that would take.
