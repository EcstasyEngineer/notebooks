Did you undress you beary?!

06:33.760 --> 06:34.880
I hope you are doing well lol

06:39.800 --> 06:42.040
I took a nap eldersday

06:42.880 --> 06:45.040
awlair than yesterday

06:47.840 --> 06:50.920
to make sure that

06:52.020 --> 07:01.940
that I'm not going to have any chance to wake up for stream

07:01.940 --> 07:27.760
ဵျံ ဧေိဏဴအ. ပ

07:31.940 --> 07:36.980
about them for me. I don't know. I guess I also get like really immersed in some of them so

07:39.540 --> 07:44.420
so yeah, I hope you will enjoy watching me trying my best to become

07:45.300 --> 07:52.260
the number one rock star. I'm also dumb. I got myself some tea and I was gonna drink it

07:52.260 --> 07:59.380
while the loading screen was going, but I forgot. Hold on, I wanna see if it's still warm.

08:02.100 --> 08:05.860
Oh no, I think it's kind of warm, but

08:12.180 --> 08:19.380
it's warm. It's warm, but it's not as hot as I want it to be.

08:19.380 --> 08:24.820
I also want to drink it, but I'm also scared if I drink it, I'm gonna have to

08:26.260 --> 08:30.660
go to the bathroom a lot and I really don't want to have like

08:32.260 --> 08:37.780
a bunch of rewrite backscreens while we're playing this, so I don't know what to do.

08:39.300 --> 08:42.820
I don't want to see it, go do I see it, but I don't know.

08:48.980 --> 08:55.860
But yeah, it's really good to see you everyone. Before I start, yesterday I

08:55.860 --> 09:07.620
saw that some people donated to me while I was streaming, but the thing is, I didn't hear the

09:07.620 --> 09:16.820
alerts go off, so I couldn't know, but also on top of that, I wouldn't even know who to thank,

09:16.820 --> 09:26.980
because my so-called abomination of a setup is not gonna really let me see who did it,

09:26.980 --> 09:35.620
so I thought that for now, so for now, I think that what I'm gonna do is

09:36.900 --> 09:43.940
when there's donations, I will read them and thank the people at the end of the stream,

09:44.580 --> 09:50.580
if that's okay, until I can get a better setup, I hope that's okay with you,

09:51.380 --> 10:00.340
because I still want to thank people, because I appreciate when people support me.

10:01.940 --> 10:07.300
Here's a cute adjoin, a video where I watch a long video to be, oh really, it's not how you

10:07.300 --> 10:18.740
found me, that's so cool, zip it slowly, yeah I could, but I don't know, I can already feel

10:20.660 --> 10:27.780
I can already feel that I'm gonna have to go eventually,

10:27.780 --> 10:37.380
and I don't want to deal with it, but yeah, I prefer them to be read at the end anyway,

10:37.380 --> 10:41.380
and helps keep it flow, okay okay, that's good to know,

10:44.420 --> 10:56.260
hello, just don't wheeze, I'll try, I'll try, no promises, no promises there, if I wheeze,

10:56.260 --> 11:08.100
well at least I had a good laugh, you know, oh no, I shouldn't have told you about the wheezing

11:08.100 --> 11:19.060
on my alt account, we'll try not to make too good of jokes, oh please do, I do love laughing,

11:19.060 --> 11:27.860
I do love laughing, okay, let me open the game, and as usual, when I open the game, please let me know

11:27.860 --> 11:38.980
if the sound is okay, and if you can hear me fine, and see everything, so yeah, I also try to figure

11:38.980 --> 11:44.740
out if I can fix my mouth tracking a bit, because I feel like it's been like so so bad,

11:45.700 --> 11:51.780
do you guys think it's any better, I don't think it's like better by that much, but

11:51.780 --> 11:58.820
I feel like my mouth opens more, so I hope, I hope that's at least a little bit better,

12:03.860 --> 12:10.340
that wheeze isn't really very contagious, I hear that a lot actually, that my laugh is very contagious,

12:10.420 --> 12:20.020
I'm flattered, it's a bit, it's a bit, fuck I can't fucking read help, it's a bit better,

12:20.020 --> 12:25.380
mouth opens wider now, yeah I feel like my mouth like opens more now, because usually like,

12:26.660 --> 12:35.540
I talk and my mouth is like closed, or has my teeth out, I don't know how to fix it fully,

12:35.540 --> 12:41.620
like I've tried like many different things, and it just doesn't, it just doesn't work,

12:44.020 --> 12:50.820
I don't know if it's uh, because my mouth is small, like I remember talking about it

12:50.820 --> 13:00.260

40:30.420 --> 40:37.700
oh there's the bar, oh we should go to the bar later, we should go to the bar after we're done with work,

40:38.500 --> 40:50.500
okay, okay, okay, oh fuck, okay, let's go fix some guitars, sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to,

40:50.900 --> 41:13.380
I'm sorry, no I'm not, okay, hello, I'm here to fix guitars, repair room, okay, I guess I need to go,

41:13.860 --> 41:20.740

Emi, do you want this guitar, I think this guitar will suit you very well,

42:38.180 --> 42:45.140
like it has your aesthetic and stuff, guys, we should give this guitar to Emi, I think it will

42:45.220 --> 42:47.380

42:54.180 --> 43:03.060
okay, nice, complete, okay, next one, next one, let's clean

43:24.340 --> 43:30.020
for myself or something, is that what you mean, it'll be perfect for playing boner gems,

43:30.820 --> 43:35.460
yeah, I think so too, you know what, I think that would be great, that would make a great gift,

43:35.460 --> 43:37.860
I know, I think Emi will really love my gift,

43:46.740 --> 43:57.060
nice, okay, now paint, okay, who do you want me to gift this next guitar to,

44:00.100 --> 44:09.300
I want to make custom guitars with beautiful designs, oh Jesus, approved,

44:12.100 --> 44:19.780

44:46.100 --> 44:52.980
you could make a yellow snow guitar, that's true, man, what would be a good thing,

44:53.060 --> 45:08.100
BDSM guitar, bondage guitar, tie it, oh maybe, if I was like shit, she be the toilet,

45:09.300 --> 45:17.220

Let's buy some beer. Nice, nice. Hello. Can I have some beer? Thank you.

48:53.460 --> 49:00.660
This sounds. Yeah, look at me. Hello.

49:00.660 --> 49:16.660
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Big hello to all my fans. Hello. Okay, let's talk to you, Snowberry.

49:16.660 --> 49:27.660
I want to flirt with you, Snowberry. Well, I can't because apparently I have no fucking personality.

49:27.660 --> 49:40.660
Can I talk to you, Snowberry? No. Wow. I really suck so much. I'm not even allowed to flirt with the Snowberries. What the fuck?

49:40.660 --> 49:44.660
Snowberries out of my league. What the fuck?

49:45.660 --> 50:02.660
Oh, no, the fuck? No, not enough risk. Come on. Hello. Ask.

50:03.660 --> 50:11.660
Okay, okay. We can flirt with you after all. I've still got all of us.

50:11.660 --> 50:25.660
Okay, let's raise you real good, Oji-san. You've been rejected, but there was... What the fuck? Can I not even talk?

50:25.660 --> 50:29.660
Can I not even talk? Hello?

50:32.660 --> 50:42.660
Why can't I even talk? Bro, why can't I even talk to anyone? What the fuck? It's fucking over. It's fucking over.

50:42.660 --> 50:53.660
I can't flirt. I can't even fucking talk to you. I'm not even allowed to talk to my Snowberries. What the fuck is this about?

50:54.660 --> 51:03.660
Oh, my God. Okay, well, I'm hungry, so I'm gonna start eating my emotions. Yeah. Thank you.

51:03.660 --> 51:14.660
Well, that was a good day. You know what? Okay, you know what? You know what? Fuck you. You can't urinate in here.

51:14.660 --> 51:27.660
Oh, my God. Fuck off. Can I talk to you? No. Can I talk to anyone here? No. Please.

51:27.660 --> 51:36.660
I just want to talk to my Snowberries. Lady, why are you standing here like a fucking statue? Please.

51:36.660 --> 51:41.660
Hi, Oji-san. You would probably be interested, right?

51:45.660 --> 52:02.660
It's for being urinated in public. No, it's not. Yeah, fuck you. Fuck you for not letting me talk to my Snowberries. What the fuck?

52:02.660 --> 52:16.660
On the bright side, only minus one popularity. I mean, at that point, I have zero popularity then because apparently I have negative fucking risk to the point that I can't even talk to you Snowberries.

52:16.660 --> 52:23.660
So, yeah, that's fucking great. Press the K key and spin your first skill point.

52:24.660 --> 52:29.660
Ooh.

52:29.660 --> 52:33.660
I just need a breath.

52:33.660 --> 52:40.660
Let's just chat with Snowberries. Fuck yes, I'm unlocking that.

52:40.660 --> 52:49.660
Okay, wait. Can I do it now then? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Let's test it. Maybe now I can. Maybe now I can.

52:50.660 --> 52:55.660
Okay, let's try again.

52:55.660 --> 53:01.660
Okay, now I'm actually allowed to talk.

53:01.660 --> 53:09.660
Hello, Oji-san. I don't know who this is, but it doesn't matter, okay? This is about me.

53:09.660 --> 53:24.660
This is about me. Ignore her. Ignore her. She will never. She is trashed here. I'm the one who matters here. Pay attention to me, okay?

53:24.660 --> 53:31.660
Because fucking damn it. Let me stand. Okay, fuck you. Let me stand. Hello!

53:31.660 --> 53:39.660
Fucking bitch. Okay, whatever. Okay, now I can finally talk to you Snowberry. Let's go.

53:39.660 --> 53:44.660
Okay, what do you want?

53:45.660 --> 53:52.660
What do you want?

53:56.660 --> 54:00.660
I need your loving.

54:00.660 --> 54:08.660
Snowberry. Fuck, I have zero reason. I don't know how to fucking flirt.

54:08.660 --> 54:17.660
Well, my love's like a pub on Monday. None existed.

54:21.660 --> 54:31.660
That's okay, because I can provide you that love wink.

54:32.660 --> 54:47.660
Charmour, are you? My heart's like my wallet mate. Better when it's full, but Alice is always empty.

54:47.660 --> 54:59.660
I'm sorry, Snowberry, but I have no idea what the fuck that means.

55:00.660 --> 55:06.660
What the fuck? I heard it like in my fucking ear. Oh my god, that scared the shit out of me.

55:06.660 --> 55:15.660
It's a high level technique called avoiding commitment by using metaphors, advanced stuff really.

55:15.660 --> 55:22.660
Okay, and how did that work for you so far?

55:23.660 --> 55:31.660
Look at Charm, unless I'm trying to find a job, then it's as effective as chocolate tea pot.

55:31.660 --> 55:38.660
I'm not talking about jobs here.

55:38.660 --> 55:46.660
What the fuck? Why did I get minus fifty dollars? What the fuck? I'm not talking about jobs here, okay?

55:47.660 --> 55:56.660
Okay, I'm just gonna be straight forward. Let me suck here.

56:02.660 --> 56:10.660
I'm gonna be straight forward. Let me suck you dick, baby.

56:11.660 --> 56:23.660
Sorry, my dear, but the menu's not served at this spot. Try the fantasy section of the library.

56:23.660 --> 56:34.660
What the fuck? How dare you reject me? I am number one whore.

56:41.660 --> 56:53.660
Well, I prefer a more exclusive club. Membership, just me. Cheers to your ambition, Tom.

56:53.660 --> 57:08.660
I'm actually gonna open a membership, a membership eventually. Are you interested?

57:11.660 --> 57:27.660
Membership for what? The number one whore club. Oh, pass, but thanks for the exclusive.

57:28.660 --> 57:33.660
What the fuck?

57:33.660 --> 57:39.660
Bro, what the fuck is this?

57:39.660 --> 57:43.660
What the fuck?

57:43.660 --> 57:48.660
Hold on, let me adjust my sitting position.

57:48.660 --> 57:52.660
Oh my god, what the fuck, Rufus?

57:52.660 --> 58:00.660
What the fuck? I thought you're my fan. How could you? How could you do this to me? What the fuck?

58:04.660 --> 58:11.660
You are totally missing out, my dude.

58:11.660 --> 58:17.660
There is dick suck.

58:25.660 --> 58:30.660
Well, that sounds like a niche market you've cornered.

58:30.660 --> 58:37.660
Enjoy the echoes. Stick to my point. It's over.

58:37.660 --> 58:52.660
It's over. He said I hate this shit. Zero res. Nobody is interested. Fuck my life.

58:52.660 --> 58:58.660
He is a hater. He is a hater. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, Snow Berries, you know?

58:58.660 --> 59:06.660
Sometimes there's gonna be haters and that's completely fine, you know?

59:06.660 --> 59:13.660
Not everyone is gonna want to join my big membership club and that's totally fine.

59:13.660 --> 59:17.660
You know why? Because I'm sure someone will love it.

59:17.660 --> 59:24.660
Okay, okay, okay. It's gonna be okay. Just like he said. Okay, okay, okay.

59:24.660 --> 59:32.660
Okay, where's my fucking car?

59:33.660 --> 59:35.660
Is this my car?

59:35.660 --> 59:41.660
Let's see. Instead of asking people out directly, how can they...

59:41.660 --> 59:45.660
I'm a person who doesn't want to talk to them.

59:45.660 --> 59:48.660
I mean, I already talked to them. Why do I need to ask them out?

59:48.660 --> 59:51.660
Okay, well, whatever. Okay.

59:51.660 --> 59:55.660
I'm gonna do it just to get this fucking thing.

59:55.660 --> 01:00:00.660
So, do you want to go out with me after our big talk?

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:03.660
No. Okay, bye.

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:05.660
Go home.

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:07.660
If you want, you can use the bus stop.

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:13.660
Why would I use the bus stops when I can literally just drive home?

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.660
Literally, why?

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:19.660
Please explain it to me.

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:33.660
I'll join your number one whore club. Oh my god, thank you. I appreciate it.

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:42.660
Thank you for supporting me, Snowberry. I promise you, you will have the best number one experience in my club.

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.660
The worst you can say is no.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:51.660
And then there's Rufus just completely fucking obliterating me

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:58.660
and killing any confidence that I have left.

01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:01.660
I can't put the fucking sounds in this game.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:04.660
Okay, get out of my fucking way.

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.660
Get out of my way. I had a bad day, okay?

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:08.660
Okay, I had a bad day.

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:11.660
Leave me alone. Fuck all of you.

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:14.660
Home sweet home.

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:20.660
Open the melotify app on your phone and withdraw your welcome income.

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:23.660
Okay.

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:29.660
And withdraw your welcome income? What?

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:34.660
Huh?

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:38.660
Yeah, money.

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:42.660
Yes, Snow. Wow.

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:44.660
Thank you.

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:46.660
Give me fucking nothing.

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:50.660
Police department. Oh, great.

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:56.660
You received the traffic ticket because your car was walking traffic and car was fucked off.

01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:03.660
Please, please just let me just fucking sleep after this horrible day.

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:08.660
Press tab to say smartwatch at your end of the day start.

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:13.660
Well, fuck is...

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:18.660
I don't see a smartwatch.

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:22.660
Oh, that's what they mean. Never mind. I'm fucking stupid.

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:24.660
Being a rock star is so difficult.

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:28.660
I know. I can't even raise anyone.

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.660
What is the point?

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:36.660
Go to your bed and press the E key to sleep.

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:37.660
Okay.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:40.660
Okay, good night, Snowberries. It's been...

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:42.660
What the fuck is my bad?

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:44.660
Wait, what?

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:48.660
Ew! Where's my bad?

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.660
Am I...

01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:59.660
Oh, okay, I'm fucking stupid.

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:03.660
Okay, let's go sleep.

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:11.660
Wait, I didn't read what it said.

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.660
I didn't read what it said.

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.660
Fuck.

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:17.660
Okay, what do you want?

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.660
Who the fuck is this?

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:21.660
Hulkster.

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.660
Buddy.

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.660
I totally rocked the casino yesterday.

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:28.660
You gotta go try your luck for sure.

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:30.660
I don't know about that.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:34.660
Fuck, I'm starving. I need to eat.

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:36.660
I need to eat.

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:38.660
Hello.

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:40.660
Can I have some food, please?

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:42.660
Thank you.

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.660
Oh, that was just a tutorial.

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:50.660
Yeah, a tutorial for getting roasted.

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:56.660
Fuck, excuse me for clearing my throat so much.

01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:58.660
I would mute myself,

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:01.660
but my microphone doesn't have a mute button

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:04.660
and with my setup,

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:08.660
it's just full-screen the game, so...

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:11.660
Please bear with me. No pun intended.

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.660
Read.

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:18.660
What the fuck is this?

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:21.660
Wait!

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.660
Wait, this thing at the bottom!

01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:30.660
Isn't that one of those sock artists?

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:34.660
Flark. Flork. Flark. Flark.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.660
Art?

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.660
Are they allowed to do this?

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:42.660
Flork.

01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:44.660
Yeah, that's what I meant.

01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:46.660
Is that a flork art?

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:49.660
Are they allowed to use it?

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:52.660
I wonder if they're even allowed to use it.

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:58.660
Okay, let's read my diary out loud for you, snowberries.

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:01.660
I'm sharing this very important page with you

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:03.660
just because you're my snowberry,

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:07.660
so that's why I'm sharing with you my cringe fucking diary, okay?

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:11.660
Yo, yo, yo, buddy.

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:13.660
I'm so full of energy today.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.660
I have tons of things to tell you.

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:18.660
First of all, my grandmother.

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:21.660
She's an amazing woman.

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:24.660
Thanks to her, I'm one step closer to my dreams.

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.660
No, I'm not.

01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:30.660
My grandma sold her antique watch to buy me a guitar.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.660
Can you believe it?

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.660
She sacrificed something so valuable for my dreams.

01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:38.660
That watch was very precious to my grandma,

01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:41.660
but she put my happiness above her own.

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:43.660
I can never thank her enough.

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:46.660
And here I am, on the streets,

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.660
pissing on people, making music with Riki.

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:53.660
Our shared passion for music brought us together.

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:56.660
Seeing the smiles on people's face,

01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:59.660
watching their feet move to the rhythm

01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:01.660
is an incredible feeling.

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:05.660
With our music, to bring joy to people's days,

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.660
to make them feel good,

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:09.660
even if for just a few moments,

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:11.660
it's indescribable.

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:14.660
I can't fucking read.

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:18.660
I'm working tirelessly every day to play my guitar better.

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:21.660
Each chord, each melody

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:24.660
brings me a little closer to my dream.

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:28.660
My admiration for Lara Croft is as fresh

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:31.660
as it was on the first day,

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:35.660
and she remains a great source of inspiration for me.

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:38.660
I don't know if I'll ever be as good as her,

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:41.660
but I'll never stop trying.

01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:43.660
Life can be tough at times,

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:45.660
but with the happiness music gives me,

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.660
I can overcome anything.

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:50.660
And remember, Diary,

01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:52.660
as I've always said,

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:55.660
I'm going to be a rock star.

01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:59.660
Bro, what the fuck?

01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:01.660
Okay, great.

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.660
Very nice, Diary.

01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:05.660
Can I write a new song yet?

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:07.660
No.

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.660
Where is this?

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:16.660
And why the fuck has my door opened the entire time?

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.660
I don't think that's very safe.

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:23.660
Do I have anything in here?

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:28.660
Charlotte.

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:33.660
Wait, didn't this guy try to talk to me or something?

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.660
Unless I'm stupid.

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:41.660
Noah.

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:43.660
Hello.

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:46.660
I'm going to give you a very important piece of advice.

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:48.660
Listen carefully. Yes, yes.

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.660
Be the one who listens.

01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:52.660
Don't you dare tell anyone.

01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:00.660
You must have a lot of courage to make that move.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.660
Yes, I do.

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:04.660
That's how I roll.

01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:06.660
Despite all your efforts,

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:09.660
I don't think you'll ever become a real rock star.

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.660
Not that easy? Yes, it is.

01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:15.660
You know what happens to dreamy punks like you around here?

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:17.660
No.

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:23.660
Why do I need to...

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.660
Where did you go to?

01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:31.660
Ooh, there's a clothing store.

01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.660
I'm kind of curious.

01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:39.660
Kind of curious what they have at the store.

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:41.660
Let's see.

01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:46.660
I wouldn't see if they have anything cute that I could buy, you know?

01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:51.660
Because I mean, I've been looking like a homeless person this entire time, so...

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:55.660
I want to see if they have like a cute skirt or something cute.

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:01.660
Hello.

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:07.660
Okay, how do I...

01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:10.660
How do I buy clothes?

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:12.660
Hello?

01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:17.660
Okay.

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:19.660
Okay.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.660
Do we have any skirts?

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.660
What is...

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:34.660
Okay, all these clothes are fucking shit.

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:37.660
This skirt is like...

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:41.660
This skirt is like the most...

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:44.660
Okay, out of all of them.

01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:49.660
But none of them are like, wow, that's my style.

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:54.660
Okay, some heels.

01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:58.660
And everything is like fucking 500.

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:03.660
Look at the glasses, I look so cool with them. Should I buy them?

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:06.660
Ooh, I might buy the glasses to look extra cool.

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:08.660
It also increases my charisma.

01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:12.660
Okay, I should go to work then and save my money.

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:16.660
As much as I can anyways.

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:21.660
170 cents, that's broke.

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:26.660
Yes, that's why you need to give me money, Snowberry.

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:32.660
So I can finally look like not a fucking homeless person, okay?

01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:38.660
Don't you understand the importance of fashion in the rock star music industry?

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:39.660
Come on.

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:40.660
Okay.

01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:42.660
Oh fuck.

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:43.660
Why isn't...

01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:44.660
What the fuck?

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.660
Why is it on this side?

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:48.660
Okay, a map.

01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:54.660
Where is my...

01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:02.660
Where is my fucking job place?

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:06.660
Uh...

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:10.660
That is not the center.

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.660
Oh, that's how you move the map.

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:15.660
Okay, I need to move it that way, guitar shop.

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:20.660
Okay, let's go to the guitar shop so I can make some more money.

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:26.660
Okay, get out of my way, lady.

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:29.660
Get out of my way.

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.660
Get out of my way.

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:35.660
Look at the map, look at...

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:42.660
Why does literally everyone have the same fucking car?

01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:44.660
What's your problem?

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:57.660
I really wish this freaking game had music.

01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:00.660
Like, how are you gonna drive in the car and not have music?

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:02.660
Something ...

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:18.660
Okay, I got the...

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:24.660
Fuck I'm stuck!

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:25.660
Please.

01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:27.660
No.

01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:29.660

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.420
How big it is段

01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:50.300
What?

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:55.180
Why is it showing as blue?, I am trying to make, it purple

01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:58.460
Okay

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:03.320
They brought drop it in dirt. No, I think I think they dropped it in shit to be honest

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:08.700
Okay

01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:15.100
Let's see. Oh, I know I know we can start with some scissors.

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:24.220
I mean to be fair that does not look like scissors

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.020
but

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:30.000
That looks like a fucking ribbon

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:36.760
Wow, that looks like shit. Well, I'm sorry, okay? I'm not I'm not a

01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:43.580
Scaled artist like the rest of my gen mates, okay? I'm sorry, but but it's but it's the truth. I

01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:50.060
I am I'm better at drawing ugly things that that's

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.580
That's my

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:59.580
My talent drawing ugly things, okay? And that's okay because that means that

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:02.780
It has more soul to it, right? So

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:05.340
So that's fine

01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:10.380
Man, I really want to fix it all like fuck. This is bothering me. This is bothering me too much

01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:15.180
It just it just looks so bad like I I can't

01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:18.540
Okay, that's

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.700
A little better, I guess

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:25.820
I

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:30.700
Can't even make a stick figure

01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:35.260
I I can I can you're skilled in other ways

01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:40.060
God I wish you don't I I really wish I would

01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:43.900
I really feel like I'm not skilled in anything

01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:47.740
But if you ever find something that you think I'm skilled at

01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:51.740
Please let me know that will that will make me very happy

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:55.980
Okay, so we have the scissors now

01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:58.940
What else do we want to add

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:01.020
to mercy's

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:05.900
Thing oh, I know we can add some like blood like

01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:11.660
Blood stains and stuff. Yeah, we can make it look like blood stains, I think

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:15.420
No, that's

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:17.660
I needed it to be a bit brighter

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.500
More like this I think

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.700
I

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:27.100
Wow

01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:29.340
Wow, I can't even

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:31.740
Throw fucking blood properly

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.300
Okay

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:36.700
Wow, look at me go

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.500
That looks like

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.860
Like a fucking disease on a guitar. That's what it looks like

01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:46.220
To be honest with you

01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:50.780
But that's okay, I'm sure she will appreciate my effort

01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:55.660
It's it's always about the intention, you know, I think it's always about the intention

01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:59.420
That's what truly truly matters

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:02.300
She will be like wow, I see

01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:07.020
Thank you for this ugly fucking guitar that you made for me. I love

01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:10.380
Draw a heart, okay

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:12.460
True

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:17.180
Ooh, I can do like a broken heart because that's what her eyes are like

01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:24.460
She had like a broken heart, okay, well

01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:36.060
I just can't win I just can't fucking win it's fucking over

01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:43.420
Okay, that's that's the closest that I can get to a broken heart

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:46.300
Heart I meant to say heart

01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.860
eyepatch

01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:57.580

For me, it's I guess resting

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.900
A sad voice

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:23.820

Do anything

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:23.020
I don't know about that

01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:25.420
But thank you

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:28.140
Stabith

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.620
Oh, no

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:33.900
Not me having the joystick name originally

01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:38.700
Joystick snow paws god damn

01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:47.100
Now do yours no, I don't want to do mine yet. I want to first make sure I make

01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:51.340
Guitar for each and every one of the girls and then

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:54.940
And then I'll make

01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:57.020
One for myself

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:03.020
So many guitars are being dropped in the mod. I think they're being dropped in shit

01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:09.100
Fuck

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.500
Okay, nice

01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:15.340
Uh

01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:18.460
I see shawl

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:21.180
Yeah, why don't you don't even know what that means?

01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:25.260
Uh, who who should we make the next guitar for?

01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:36.620
Uh

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:45.420
I think I guess I'll make one for strongy

01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:54.300
And then next time I do this job, I'll make one uh for azzer

01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:58.860
Fondle of both of

01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:07.980
I already made one for shibi shibi's guitar has a toilet on it and ebony

01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:14.780
You're good. Stop saying you sound sad. I'm not sad. What the fuck

01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:20.780
God damn it stupid ogisan. I'm not sad. What is your problem?

01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:28.460
Holy fuck ogisan. I think you're deaf. Okay. I'm not sad. What the fuck is your problem?

01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:33.260
Okay, let's make one for strongy

01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:42.780
I was trying to drive tentacle, but

01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:47.340
I don't I don't know how I feel about this

01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:53.820
What the fuck

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:57.900
The tentacles have dots on them

01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:02.620
I can't remember what tentacles look like so pretend

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:06.540
Tentacles have weird circles on them

01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:12.060
Tentacle looking guitar for strongy

01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:15.740
Tentacle looking

01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:18.780
Suction cups

01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:22.460
Rings. Okay, so I have this. I also wanted to have something

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:26.220
A little bit pink to resemble

01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:31.820
The kashies pink and green in her hair. What would be the pink?

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:39.740
Uh depends on the tentacle

01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:42.620
Yeah

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:45.740
Oh, I think I know hold on. I think I know

01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:56.620
Eyes no no no no not eyes. I was thinking of um she has like the cute seashells she has

01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:04.380
Seashells on her hair

01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:09.360
Nice that looks cute

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.440
Good

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:17.440
Halen Bieler has seen the most tentacles as a wonder. I mean probably strongy

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:25.760
She literally lives under the sea so I assume she sees tentacles every freaking day

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.600
I think that would make sense

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:33.200
Okay, well this one looks like fucking shit because I don't have enough

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.800
Space and I can't make the brush small enough

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.600
Under the sea

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:45.280
There are videos you can use for reference for reference for what to draw

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.960
No, I'm good

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:56.640
Trolley and artist of all time. Thank you. I'm glad you think so. What else could we add?

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.640
Write her name too. Okay

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:04.000
I don't know if I will have space. Where could I

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.320
Give me here

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.600
Strah

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.120
Knee

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.000
Nice and then also put a heart in here

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.640
Okay, nice. Okay, that's cute

01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:32.880
Should we put a sticker? What stickers do we have?

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:36.960
I

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:39.520
Wish we had more stickers

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.040
They really don't

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:47.920
They really don't have a big variety. Um

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.320
Oh

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.320
How do I can I make the stickers

01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:58.320
I

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:06.800
What the fuck am I doing? I want to make the stickers bigger, but I can't

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.760
Okay, whatever

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:14.260
I don't know how you put it in there

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:23.680
Just just just pretend it makes sense this this sticker here is supposed to uh resemble

01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.640
Uh the fact that she is

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.600
Mine and my gen mates mommy

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:35.120
Okay, this sticker that that's what it resembles. It resembles mommy

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:44.480
Oh, there's another one. Okay, I didn't know I'm doing three today. Okay. I can make azeris then

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:47.840
You can make azeris as well then

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.560
This has literally become a fucking

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:57.680
Costume guitar make up make up. Fuck. I can't talk this has officially become

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.400
um

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:04.080
A fucking uh, we can't talk costume

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:09.760
Uh guitar maker simulator. That's what this game has become apparently for me

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.560
The best few minutes

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:22.960
Me

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.120
Fuck

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:38.720
Okay, nice. Okay. So uh next

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:44.000
We're going to be doing

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:46.240
We're going to be doing

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Acera

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:53.040
Okay, so I think

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.240
She be soggy at the guitar

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:03.280
Wait, really? Did she did you see it?

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:07.200
Really? What did you say? What did she say?

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.320
Oh, no, she's probably gonna kill me

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.040
Oh, no, she's probably gonna kill me

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:18.320
What did she say about my guitar? I want to know

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:26.560
You get spanked. I snitched. Yeah, she says you're getting a spanking. Oh, no

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:29.440
Not like this

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:32.640
I'm sorry, she be

She add your twitter responding to it. Oh god, I see a sweater god you're getting spanked for this

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:56.560
Okay, I'm wondering though. I'm really wondering what's himi's reaction is gonna be when she sees hers

01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:01.840
Because hers is the most fucking unhinged one that I've made

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:05.360
Like I made everyone

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.400

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:15.760
And imi are the most unhinged and like funny ones and let me see me make for everyone else like

I know what I want to draw

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:37.520
Could you show the guitars again?

01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:41.760
I can't you you'll have to watch the vod and go back

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:47.920
Uh to see all of them. There's no option to like see these guitars again or anything like that

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:54.240
Um, okay, I want to I want to draw a baby bottle. I want to draw a baby bottle

01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.880
Let's start with a baby bottle. I think that would be good

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:01.120
Hmm

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:07.280
Let's start with

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:11.680
Okay, I know what this looks like right now

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:14.880
But please

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:20.640
This is not the final result. Okay, this is this is not the final result. Trust the process

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:23.280
Trust the process, okay

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.680
Okay

01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:31.200
Okay

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:33.280
No

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:39.760
Leave it like that. No, I I don't want to get in trouble with acera as well. I'm good

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:44.240
I don't want to get in trouble with acera as well

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.960
Or imi because I don't know what what's going to be imi's reaction when she sees hers

01:30:50.960 --> 01:31:00.960
Hopefully she doesn't curse me with her magic book. Or like fucking kills me

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:05.520
Ah

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.800
Oh, that's not the same

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:12.560
I fucked up

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:16.080
Nice, look that looks cute, right?

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:20.000
I think that looks cute. We have like a milk thing

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:25.680
Because because she has uh the baby bottle in her oshi mark. So I think that's cute, right?

01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:32.320
I like it. I think it's cute should I add uh one of those like lines that they have

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:36.880
That show like how much uh of the milk you have

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:39.120
You

01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:48.080
Should put a brown gold but small that's the thing that's the smallest that I can make my

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:54.080
Brush which kind of sucks if I could make it smaller. I could probably drive in better stuff

01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:00.080
Yeah, but why you draw poop? What do you mean? I didn't draw poop. What are you talking about?

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:04.240
This is a baby bottle and this is the thing you suckle on

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:06.880
What the fuck has her in it?

01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:09.920
um

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:11.920
Wait

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:15.680
I went back to see imi's because I forgot hers is just

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:21.200
Okay, so imi's imi's guitar has a big dunk, but

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:24.800
It has a skeleton on top of it

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:28.720
So

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:30.720
Do you see what i'm saying?

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.680
I don't even know what i'm saying, so don't pay attention

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:41.840
It's a nipple. Yeah, yeah, it's like it's it's the baby bottle the nipple thing like uh you suck on on the baby bottle

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:46.640
That that that's what it is

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.440
Okay, what else should we draw?

01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:51.840
I want to draw a gold, but I don't know if I would be

01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:57.120
Able to really draw a gold because the brush is just not small enough

01:32:58.400 --> 01:32:59.920
uh

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
I'm not sure

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:04.960
Like I would draw a gold otherwise cookies

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:08.800
Just her horns

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:13.360
I don't remember how to draw

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:20.000
Draw the letters milf. Oh, that's a good one hold on

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:24.720
Sorry about the noise outside if you can hear it

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.560
Beep beep, okay, we're gonna put this

01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:31.920
I

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:36.080
Milf

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.600
Nice

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:48.320
I don't have space to write all of that. Okay. I have very limited space, okay

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:51.600
Maybe like blue in the white part

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:55.520
Wait, what do you mean? What do you mean like?

01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:03.360
And then put a heart maybe

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:09.840
Well, that's at least fucking hard I've ever seen

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
What is my fucking problem?

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:21.120
That's the problem with with with this the problem with this thing

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:27.440
Is that because the brush is so fucking thick like I can't draw things as well as I usually would when I do

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.680
Stuff with my mouse

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:35.680
Below the strings thingy wait, what do you want me to put?

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:39.920
Below the strings thingy

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:49.360
Is cute do you think it's good enough or or are we missing or should we add something else?

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.360
Small diamond

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.400
Hmm

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.520
Can I even draw a diamond that's not gonna look like complete fucking shit

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:12.720
Fuck how do you draw a diamond I forgot I think like this

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:17.520
Wow, that looks like shit

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:21.360
Man, I hate the brush in this game

01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:34.880
Could you draw being conquerors? Sure, you know what let's do this

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:46.880
There you go

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:55.920
Why did I out of pee what the fuck I didn't even click to pee what the fuck

01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:59.600
What the fuck I didn't

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:06.320
What oh fuck I'm starving as well. What the fuck happened

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:13.280
I finished making the guitars and I instantly started pissing. What the fuck?

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:18.400
I'm starving. I need to get food. What is happening?

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:24.000
Pissing over the floor or like pissing simulator. Okay, real

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.800
Oh my god, can my

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:30.320
My stomach stop me in those rooms. Is it what the fuck?

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:34.080
Okay, I need I need to go back home

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.320
Need to desperately go home

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:42.640
Yeah, what are those noises?

01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:51.040
See this is this is why I I don't want anyone to hear my tummy sounds and

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:56.960
Bitch, please stop. Oh my god. I hate the sound. What the fuck?

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:02.240
What the hell is this?

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.400
Holy fuck

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:08.560
What are those noises?

01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:10.720
What the fuck did you eat?

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:15.360
All I ate is baby food and a banana before stream

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:18.400
What the fuck?

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:23.200
Are you okay?

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:28.880
Uh, I will be when I become the number one star

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:34.160
The fuck I had this fucking game

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:38.160
Oh my god

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:47.360
Those aren't the fun time you sound this smart. Yeah, no shit. Come on, please give me food

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:54.000
The hell are you doing eating baby food? Um, I like to get

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.280
pouches of

01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:03.760
Baby food because they're easy to eat for me and they're like a nice quick snack

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:05.520
so

01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:12.000
Before a stream I I don't like to have a full meal. I like to eat my full dinner after stream

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:14.080
so before a stream I always get

01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:18.960
A banana and like a pouch of baby food and that keeps me full

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.640
While I stream

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:29.040
I really I really like mango flavored ones. Those are the best

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:34.560
What kind of baby food? Uh, it has banana mango

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.760
And and gojava in it. I think

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.800
Okay, let's do piss time

01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:50.960
You know, I should have pissed on someone outside, but I already have like minus one charisma, so

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:54.080
I don't know if I want to ruin that

01:38:55.280 --> 01:39:01.280
Doesn't look gross. I mean, I don't see it. It's it's in a pouch like you it's in a pouch

01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:03.920
And then you open it and then you like

01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:07.680
You know, like you suck it basically the food

01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:12.080
Why baby food

01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:18.720
Because it's it's just convenient. It's like it's in a pouch. It's fast. It's easy. I open it

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:22.480
I I suck it up. It gives me full

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:25.200
for the time that I stream and

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:28.400
Yeah

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.400
Convenient fast healthy

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:33.840
Sweet and nice

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:36.160
Good enough for me

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:39.360
Why are so we do right behind the toilet?

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:41.600
Um

01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:48.560
You know, you want to know why because when I stand here and I piss I like to look outside

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:55.200
You know, like I really want to get a nice view while I pee that makes me really happy

01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:03.280
Why not astronaut food sounds way cooler? I don't know where I would get

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:07.120
astronaut food to be honest. I don't know

01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:15.600
Uh, where's my bed is supposed to be here, right? I'm supposed to go to sleep, right? Can I make a new song yet or no?

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:21.360
Wow, no, I fucking can't okay, whatever

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:24.560
It's bad time

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:28.080
Every time I open this

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:32.000
I'm sorry. Okay. I have a small bladder

01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:35.200
I can't help it

01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:37.600
Okay, so what the fuck?

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:49.040
Oh, I was supposed to go to the casino

01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:55.440
Right, let's go to the casino. I completely forgot about that

01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:58.080
Yeah, we should we should try it out

01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:01.040
We should try it out and see if we can get lucky

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Stop staring at me

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:06.240
Where's my car?

01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:08.240
Did they tow my car again?

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:13.200
I think they did because I'm too lazy to park it anywhere

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:28.080
Rufus took it. I'm gonna kill Rufus. How dare he reject me? Okay, let's see the map

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:30.800
Uh

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:34.160
Where is

01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:38.720
Uh park on strong car dealer

01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:45.760
Uh casino, okay nice. Okay, let's go

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:54.880
Did they steal your car? I don't think so. I think I think they went to like tow it

01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:57.680
or something like that

01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:00.800
I want you to break up with him

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:02.880
We weren't even in a relationship

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
I got straight up rejected

01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:11.440
Rufus straight up fucking rejected me. Did you not see the conversation?

Sounds like a rockstar to me.

That's a rockstar life. You go piss on people.

02:09:52.040 --> 02:09:56.040
GAMBALL and make custom guitars for your friends.

02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:08.040
Fuck, fuck.

02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:20.040
Since I'm here, I'm gonna exit the game.

02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:28.040
And I am gonna thank the people who have donated.

02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:36.040
And then I'm gonna redirect you into Strani.

02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:40.040
Let me see.

Let me see.

Let me add any top on my stream elements.

02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:02.040

02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:30.040
Thank you for watching the stream.

02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:34.040
I know you're telling me thank you for the stream.

02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:40.040
But it's big thanks for your snowberries.

02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:42.040
For being here.

02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:48.040
How do I view it in a bigger thing?

02:11:52.040 --> 02:12:06.040
I'm gonna read the ones from yesterday and from today.

02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:08.040
Okay, so Mike Honey said.

02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:10.040
Russian honey.

02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:12.040
Oh, bratty lolly baba.

02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:14.040
It's correction.

02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:16.040
Oh, sorry for the cringe.

02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:18.040
It's fine.

02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:20.040
It's fine. Thank you so much.

02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:24.040
Thank you for the $6.9 tip, Mike Honey.

02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:30.040
Anonymous, thank you for the $4.2 donation.

02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:34.040
Why didn't the polar bear bright turn up to her wedding?

02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:36.040
She got cold feet.

02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:44.040
I'm sorry, I don't get the joke on, but I appreciate the effort.

02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:54.040
Joshua, thank you for the $4.2 donation.

02:12:54.040 --> 02:13:04.040
Thank you for the $10 donation.

02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:06.040
Why am I freezing?

02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:08.040
What the fuck?

02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:10.040
This is shit.

02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:12.040
We believe in UIC.

02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:14.040
Thank you for believing in me.

02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:16.040
I appreciate it.

02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:22.040
Joshua, thank you for the $6.9 donation.

02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:30.040
Mike Honey, thank you for the $3.33 donation.

02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:34.040
Now watch Netflix with a polar bear.

02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:38.040
They're always pressing pause.

02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:42.040
Okay, Mike Honey, okay.

02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:44.040
Joshua, thank you for the donation.

02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:46.040
Thank you for the stream.

02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:48.040
I keep up the good work.

02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:50.040
Thank you, thank you for coming to my stream.

02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:52.040
I appreciate it.

02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:58.040
And another donation from Joshua.

02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:00.040
Thank you again.

02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:10.040
Namecatguy said cute brat.

02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:14.040
Thank you for the $4 donation.

02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:18.040
Joshua, thank you for the $6 donation.

02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:28.040
Mike Honey, why do you call a polar bear who likes to sunbathe a solar bear?

02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:32.040
Oh gee, son, you better get better jokes.

02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:34.040
Why are these jokes?

02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:40.040
I'm not laughing, but thank you for the $3 donation.

02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:46.040
Mike Honey, baby food equals true lolly.

02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:52.040
Thank you Mike Honey for the $6 donation.

02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:54.040
Oh my god, help.

02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:56.040
I fucking can.

02:14:56.040 --> 02:14:58.040
But yeah, thank you.

02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:00.040
Thank you for everyone who's dead.

02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:02.040
I can't fucking talk.

02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:06.040
Thank you to everyone who donated yesterday and in today's stream.

02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:10.040
I really, really appreciate it.

02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:12.040
Oh wait.

02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:14.040
Wait, there's another one.

02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:22.040
Oh, tuning in on my lunch hour is becoming a cozy part of my daily routine.

02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:26.040
Oh, thank you for the $10 donation.

02:15:26.040 --> 02:15:28.040
And thank you.

02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:34.040
I'm very happy that I can be a cozy part of your daily routine.

02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:40.040
Although I don't know how cozy I am to be honest with how chaotic I can get.

02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:42.040
But thank you, I appreciate it.

02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:44.040
Okay, okay, okay.

02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:52.040
So again, thank you very much for everyone who came to my stream today

02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:56.040
and talked to me and made me laugh and donated.

02:15:56.040 --> 02:15:58.040
I really appreciate it.

02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:03.040
I don't know why the fuck my tracking keeps fucking pausing.

02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:07.040
I think it's because my phone probably needs to be charged or something like that.

02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:09.040
I'm not sure what the problem is.

02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:14.040
But hopefully that didn't happen last stream.

02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:16.040
I hope that didn't happen last stream.

02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:18.040
I don't think it did.

02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:25.040
But before I go, let me make sure that I redirect.

02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:30.040
I need to remember how to do it.

02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:37.040
We will be redirecting into Strani.

02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:45.040
I need to go into my settings to do that.

02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:49.040
So, please give me a moment.

02:16:49.040 --> 02:17:03.040
Okay, redirect and Strani save.

02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:11.040
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:13.040
Okay, okay.

02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:16.040
All right, I'm gonna finish.

02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:23.040
I am not streaming tomorrow, but I will be streaming on Thursday.

02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:27.040
So I will see you guys on Thursday again.

02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:32.040
I believe Thursday I'll be playing the polar bear game if I'm not wrong.

02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:37.040
And then Friday should be a summer and Saturday the DJ stream.

02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:39.040
So yeah, thank you.

02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:41.040
Thank you for stepping by.

02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:43.040
I love you.

02:17:44.040 --> 02:17:46.040
I love you and thank you for being here.

02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:48.040
And I'll see you next time.

02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:50.040
Bye bye for now.

02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:52.040
Bye.
