Mother tells me she had followed a trail from a mysterious wreckage and found me in a cave.

04:47.440 --> 04:51.440
I was surrounded by death and darkness.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.440
Yet I was the only one to survive.

04:54.440 --> 04:59.440
This day she told me of was the last time I had ever cried.

04:59.440 --> 05:05.440
She had seen the unfathomable abuse that plagued her family for generations.

05:06.440 --> 05:11.440
A monster of a bear that wriggled fear throughout the food chain of this land.

05:11.440 --> 05:16.440
Its mere presence pressing the very soil under the snow

05:16.440 --> 05:21.440
that here it was that at the hands of a mere child

05:21.440 --> 05:24.440
was said crying alone.

05:24.440 --> 05:28.440
It was then she had decided to raise me as her own

05:28.440 --> 05:31.440
along with my brother and sister.

05:31.440 --> 05:36.440
She taught me strength to hunt to survive.

05:38.440 --> 05:41.440
I had no memories of my birth family.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.440
I did not feel the need to search for them

05:44.440 --> 05:48.440
or I had my family here and they had me.

05:48.440 --> 05:53.440
I was a bear like them and they treated me no different.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.440
We all shared the same love

05:56.440 --> 05:59.440
but mama knew it was not meant to be.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.440
There comes a time in the bear's life

06:01.440 --> 06:04.440
where they must go out on their own

06:04.440 --> 06:07.440
and that time was approaching fast.

06:07.440 --> 06:10.440
Mama knew the cops would be fine

06:10.440 --> 06:15.440
but me I couldn't even find them being without them

06:15.440 --> 06:18.440
until one day over the mountains

06:18.440 --> 06:21.440
she happened upon an answer.

06:21.440 --> 06:24.440
An answer I didn't want to accept

06:24.440 --> 06:27.440
but one I had to.

06:27.440 --> 06:30.440
And now this day

06:30.440 --> 06:34.440
the day fear finally formed in my heart for the first time

06:34.440 --> 06:37.440
saying their final goodbyes

06:37.440 --> 06:39.440
my brother went one way

06:39.440 --> 06:42.440
my sister went another

06:42.440 --> 06:44.440
but there I stood

06:44.440 --> 06:46.440
my body and mind

06:46.440 --> 06:49.440
tempered from this land of unforgiving cold

06:49.440 --> 06:52.440
was frozen still.

06:52.440 --> 06:56.440
Mother offered me her strength one last time

06:56.440 --> 07:00.440
enough to cement the final memory of her tenderness

07:00.440 --> 07:03.440
my final goodbye

07:03.440 --> 07:06.440
she would watch over me one last time

07:06.440 --> 07:09.440
on my journey down from the mountain top

07:09.440 --> 07:11.440
into the unknown of the future

07:11.440 --> 07:14.440
the memory of her love within me

07:14.440 --> 07:16.440
made the fear in my heart melt away

07:16.440 --> 07:19.440
like the ice and spring

07:19.440 --> 07:22.440
but she reminded me that the warmth of her love

07:22.440 --> 07:25.440
made me into a survivor

07:27.440 --> 07:30.440
The End

07:43.440 --> 07:46.440
Hello everybody

07:46.440 --> 07:50.440
Hi, it's so good to see you. Hello

07:50.440 --> 07:53.440
My name is Icing Snowpaws

07:53.440 --> 07:57.440
the feral polar bear from VLR's Generation 1

07:57.440 --> 07:59.440
in Daulge

07:59.440 --> 08:02.440
It's so good to see everyone

08:02.440 --> 08:08.440
I have to admit, I'm feeling quite, you know, quite nervous

08:08.440 --> 08:11.440
so I think the thing we should probably start with

08:11.440 --> 08:14.440
how about we break the ice?

08:17.440 --> 08:20.440
Come on!

08:23.440 --> 08:26.440
Okay, well, that doesn't really seem to work that well

08:26.440 --> 08:29.440
I got too big of a chunk of ice

08:29.440 --> 08:33.440
so maybe we'll be able to break the ice a bit later

08:33.440 --> 08:35.440
I hope you don't mind

08:35.440 --> 08:39.440
With that being said, I heard from civilization

08:39.440 --> 08:42.440
that it's supposed to be good manners

08:42.440 --> 08:46.440
if you bring some nice food or a treat

08:46.440 --> 08:48.440
to a big social gathering

08:48.440 --> 08:51.440
which I assume what today is, right?

08:51.440 --> 08:55.440
So, I actually made something for you to eat

08:55.440 --> 09:00.440
I brought some fresh ice-cones just for you

09:00.440 --> 09:03.440
and I really, really hope that you will like them

09:03.440 --> 09:06.440
I put so much heart into them

09:06.440 --> 09:10.440
and I was like, mmm, I really hope that they will enjoy them

09:10.440 --> 09:12.440
Oh, awesome, don't worry

09:12.440 --> 09:15.440
It's just lemon, nothing else, so...

09:15.440 --> 09:19.440
Don't worry about it, it's very nice and delicious

09:20.440 --> 09:22.440
Also, with that being said

09:22.440 --> 09:25.440
I really want to go outside and play in the snow

09:25.440 --> 09:28.440
so I can actually tell you a bit more about myself

09:28.440 --> 09:29.440
You know why?

09:29.440 --> 09:34.440
Because with my big pause paper is just kind of too much for me

09:34.440 --> 09:36.440
and hard to deal with

09:36.440 --> 09:38.440
So, I think what we should do

09:38.440 --> 09:41.440
is you should come outside together with me

09:41.440 --> 09:43.440
I know you're really cozy in your room

09:43.440 --> 09:45.440
but I think we should go outside

09:45.440 --> 09:47.440
Come on now!

09:50.440 --> 09:52.440
Open the door

09:52.440 --> 09:57.440
or I'm going to throw rock through your window, you dumb whore

10:15.440 --> 10:17.440
Get back here, you little freak

10:19.440 --> 10:21.440
Get back here, you little freak

10:39.440 --> 10:42.440
Yay, we are now finally outside

10:42.440 --> 10:44.440
I'm sorry I had to drag you out

10:44.440 --> 10:48.440
but you know, you seem to be very resistive

10:48.440 --> 10:50.440
so I thought it would be a good idea

10:50.440 --> 10:52.440
if I just drag you out

10:53.440 --> 10:54.440
With that being said

10:54.440 --> 10:57.440
let's get to know me a little bit better

10:58.440 --> 11:00.440
Let me drop over the snow

11:00.440 --> 11:03.440
because that makes it easier on my pause

11:03.440 --> 11:05.440
I hope you don't mind

11:05.440 --> 11:09.440
So, my name is Isisnopause

11:09.440 --> 11:13.440
My birthday, 27th of February

11:13.440 --> 11:15.440
Did you actually know

11:15.440 --> 11:17.440
that 27th of February

11:17.440 --> 11:20.440
is also National Polar Bear Day?

11:20.440 --> 11:22.440
Well, now you know

11:23.440 --> 11:24.440
Age

11:24.440 --> 11:26.440
I honestly have no idea

11:26.440 --> 11:29.440
Animals do not really have concept of time

11:29.440 --> 11:32.440
we do not keep track of stuff like ages

11:32.440 --> 11:35.440
or what week it is and such

11:35.440 --> 11:37.440
so you're just gonna have to

11:37.440 --> 11:39.440
assume for yourself

11:40.440 --> 11:44.440
My height is 142 cm

11:44.440 --> 11:47.440
2 cm taller than Emi

11:47.440 --> 11:50.440
That means I'm extra cool

11:51.440 --> 11:53.440
My languages

11:53.440 --> 11:56.440
I speak English and Russian

11:56.440 --> 11:58.440
Привет всем

11:58.440 --> 12:00.440
Меня зовут Isisnopause

12:00.440 --> 12:03.440
Я очень рада вас видеть сегодня

12:03.440 --> 12:06.440
Спасибо, что вы пришли увидеть меня

12:07.440 --> 12:08.440
Ok

12:10.440 --> 12:12.440
For the next information

12:12.440 --> 12:15.440
we have some of my likes

12:15.440 --> 12:17.440
and dislikes

12:17.440 --> 12:19.440
I'll move a little bit

12:19.440 --> 12:21.440
so you can see the full thing

12:21.440 --> 12:22.440
Likes

12:22.440 --> 12:24.440
I love popsicles

12:24.440 --> 12:25.440
Very yummy

12:25.440 --> 12:26.440
Refreshing

12:26.440 --> 12:27.440
Cats

12:27.440 --> 12:29.440
They're just so freaking cute

12:29.440 --> 12:32.440
I have two cats over here

12:32.440 --> 12:34.440
His name is Baklash

12:34.440 --> 12:37.440
And her name is Potato

12:37.440 --> 12:40.440
They're my two cats and I love them a lot

12:40.440 --> 12:42.440
I love spinning on chairs

12:42.440 --> 12:45.440
because it reminds me of amusement parks

12:45.440 --> 12:47.440
and if I can't go to an amusement park

12:47.440 --> 12:49.440
I can just go spin on chairs

12:49.440 --> 12:50.440
It's just fun

12:50.440 --> 12:53.440
Biting feels good against my teeth

12:53.440 --> 12:56.440
Plushies, they're just so cute

12:56.440 --> 12:58.440
There can never be enough of them

12:58.440 --> 13:00.440
I just love collecting more and more

13:00.440 --> 13:02.440
The feeling of nostalgia

13:02.440 --> 13:04.440
Just makes me really really happy

13:04.440 --> 13:06.440
That's really all there is to it

13:06.440 --> 13:09.440
I love sparkly and shiny things

13:09.440 --> 13:12.440
Like if I see glitter or something shiny

13:12.440 --> 13:14.440
I just go

13:14.440 --> 13:17.440
Wow, I need that

13:17.440 --> 13:19.440
I need to see what's that about

13:19.440 --> 13:21.440
I also love getting praised

13:21.440 --> 13:24.440
I mean, who doesn't to be honest

13:24.440 --> 13:27.440
Good words always make me smile

13:28.440 --> 13:30.440
I love salmon and tuna

13:30.440 --> 13:32.440
They're my favorite fish to eat

13:32.440 --> 13:34.440
They're just so delicious

13:34.440 --> 13:36.440
Really can't go wrong with them

13:36.440 --> 13:38.440
I love sweet alcohol

13:38.440 --> 13:41.440
Because if you give me something bitter

13:41.440 --> 13:43.440
I'm just not gonna drink it

13:43.440 --> 13:45.440
I like to have a nice flavor in my mouth

13:45.440 --> 13:48.440
Coffee, I only drink it decaf

13:48.440 --> 13:52.440
Because caffeine makes my tummy upset

13:52.440 --> 13:55.440
Probably not good for a polar bear diet

13:55.440 --> 13:58.440
This likes dust

13:58.440 --> 14:00.440
Usually makes my nose

14:00.440 --> 14:02.440
Like

14:02.440 --> 14:04.440
Itchy and sneezy

14:04.440 --> 14:07.440
And yeah, I just don't like it

14:07.440 --> 14:09.440
Extreme heat

14:09.440 --> 14:12.440
I mean, my body just doesn't deal well with it

14:12.440 --> 14:14.440
Considering I'm a polar bear

14:14.440 --> 14:16.440
So that's about that

14:16.440 --> 14:19.440
Math, numbers, anything related to that

14:19.440 --> 14:22.440
Just makes my brain extremely foggy

14:22.440 --> 14:24.440
I love popcorn

14:24.440 --> 14:27.440
But I hate when it gets stuck in my teeth

14:27.440 --> 14:31.440
So I kind of have a love-hate relationship

14:31.440 --> 14:33.440
With popcorn because of that

14:33.440 --> 14:35.440
Because I'm always really scared

14:35.440 --> 14:37.440
That a piece is gonna get stuck

14:37.440 --> 14:39.440
And I'm not gonna be able to take it out

14:43.440 --> 14:46.440
And next we have my tags

14:46.440 --> 14:48.440
My Oshi mark

14:48.440 --> 14:51.440
If you want to Oshi me and you like me

14:51.440 --> 14:54.440
It's polar bear and an ice cube

14:54.440 --> 14:56.440
My life tag is

14:56.440 --> 14:58.440
Ice line

14:58.440 --> 15:00.440
My fan art tag is

15:00.440 --> 15:02.440
IC canvas

15:02.440 --> 15:04.440
For, you know, more

15:04.440 --> 15:06.440
Not safe work art

15:06.440 --> 15:07.440
IC Oshi

15:11.440 --> 15:12.440

15:12.440 --> 15:13.440
IC clipped

15:13.440 --> 15:14.440
Memes

15:14.440 --> 15:16.440
IC memes

15:16.440 --> 15:18.440
And fan name, which is your name

15:18.440 --> 15:20.440
Is snowberries

15:20.440 --> 15:22.440
I was trying to find a name

15:22.440 --> 15:24.440
That was supposed to be like

15:24.440 --> 15:26.440
With a cute pond and stuff like that

15:26.440 --> 15:28.440
And you look so cute

15:28.440 --> 15:30.440
You look kind of like a blueberry

15:30.440 --> 15:32.440
But you're also a bear

15:32.440 --> 15:34.440
So I was like, hmm

15:34.440 --> 15:36.440
Let's see what kind of name could I pick

15:36.440 --> 15:38.440
That's like has a pond

15:38.440 --> 15:40.440
And it's also like really cute and stuff

15:40.440 --> 15:42.440
So I was like, wait

15:42.440 --> 15:44.440
Snowberry sounds so cool and like

15:44.440 --> 15:46.440
Just super cute

15:48.440 --> 15:50.440
Also, before I go to the next slide

15:50.440 --> 15:52.440
There will be some slides that you will not see

15:52.440 --> 15:54.440
In this debut

15:54.440 --> 15:56.440
You will have to come to my debut 2.0

15:56.440 --> 15:58.440
In order to see the rest of the slides

15:58.440 --> 16:00.440
As our time is

16:00.440 --> 16:02.440

16:02.440 --> 16:04.440
So I hope you understand and

16:04.440 --> 16:06.440
Maybe just get even more curious about me next

16:06.440 --> 16:08.440
I also have

16:08.440 --> 16:10.440
Lots of credits

16:10.440 --> 16:12.440
For all the wonderful people

16:12.440 --> 16:14.440
Who made today

16:14.440 --> 16:16.440
Possible

16:16.440 --> 16:18.440
They all worked very hard to make everything

16:18.440 --> 16:20.440
Beautiful

16:20.440 --> 16:22.440
Nice looking and I really appreciate

16:22.440 --> 16:24.440
Everyone's hard work

16:24.440 --> 16:26.440
That they've put into everything

16:26.440 --> 16:28.440
That they've made

16:28.440 --> 16:30.440
And now

16:30.440 --> 16:32.440
Wow

16:32.440 --> 16:34.440
If you are wondering

16:34.440 --> 16:36.440
What this is

16:36.440 --> 16:38.440
This is actually

16:38.440 --> 16:40.440
My little diary thing

16:40.440 --> 16:42.440
And I like to write

16:42.440 --> 16:44.440
Important things in my diary

16:44.440 --> 16:46.440
And of course how could I not

16:46.440 --> 16:48.440
Write in my diary about my friends

16:48.440 --> 16:50.440
My beautiful gen mates

16:50.440 --> 16:52.440
That I love so much

16:52.440 --> 16:54.440
And that make me so happy

16:56.440 --> 16:58.440
So let me

16:58.440 --> 17:00.440
Let me start with

17:00.440 --> 17:02.440
Strony

17:02.440 --> 17:04.440
Strony there's just so much to say

17:04.440 --> 17:06.440
She's so understanding

17:06.440 --> 17:08.440
She's always there for me

17:08.440 --> 17:10.440
She is so hard working

17:10.440 --> 17:12.440
And it's like a quality that

17:12.440 --> 17:14.440
I really wish that

17:14.440 --> 17:16.440
I can become more like her

17:16.440 --> 17:18.440
And learn to be more like her

17:18.440 --> 17:20.440
It's just

17:20.440 --> 17:22.440
It's humanly

17:22.440 --> 17:24.440
Impossible to me

17:24.440 --> 17:26.440
That someone is possible

17:26.440 --> 17:28.440
Someone is able

17:28.440 --> 17:30.440
Sorry

17:30.440 --> 17:32.440
I'm drawing on my words a bit

17:32.440 --> 17:34.440
Sorry

17:34.440 --> 17:36.440
It's crazy

17:36.440 --> 17:38.440
How much she works genuinely

17:38.440 --> 17:40.440
And she's really amazing

17:40.440 --> 17:42.440
So supportive really

17:42.440 --> 17:44.440
But good things to say about her

17:44.440 --> 17:46.440
Then we have

17:46.440 --> 17:48.440
Shibi

17:48.440 --> 17:50.440
Just look at her

17:50.440 --> 17:52.440
She's just so cool

17:52.440 --> 17:54.440
And I feel like if I was walking somewhere

17:54.440 --> 17:56.440
And she was walking with me

17:56.440 --> 17:58.440
I would just feel so much safety around her

17:58.440 --> 18:00.440
Like she looks like

18:00.440 --> 18:02.440
She could beat the shit out of someone

18:02.440 --> 18:04.440
If they were trying to caress me

18:04.440 --> 18:06.440
Or do something

18:06.440 --> 18:08.440
And she's just overall really cool

18:08.440 --> 18:10.440
And she's really

18:10.440 --> 18:12.440
She's all of that

18:12.440 --> 18:14.440
You know

18:14.440 --> 18:16.440
Cold outside

18:16.440 --> 18:18.440
Texture she has

18:18.440 --> 18:20.440
She is very sweet

18:20.440 --> 18:22.440
And I love her

18:22.440 --> 18:24.440
And then we have Marcy

18:24.440 --> 18:26.440
Our Yandere

18:26.440 --> 18:28.440
She's very outgoing

18:28.440 --> 18:30.440
Super sweet

18:30.440 --> 18:32.440
And silly

18:32.440 --> 18:34.440
One of the qualities that I hope to

18:34.440 --> 18:36.440
Learn to be more like her

18:36.440 --> 18:38.440
Is I hope that

18:38.440 --> 18:40.440
I can be more outgoing like her

18:40.440 --> 18:42.440
She is so good at like

18:42.440 --> 18:44.440
Always initiating conversations

18:44.440 --> 18:46.440
But I'm like the kind of person

18:46.440 --> 18:48.440
Who is too scared to initiate conversations

18:48.440 --> 18:50.440
With anyone

18:50.440 --> 18:52.440
So I always talk like in group chat

18:52.440 --> 18:54.440
But

18:54.440 --> 18:56.440
I never initiate because I get really shy

18:56.440 --> 18:58.440
And nervous

18:58.440 --> 19:00.440
And stuff like that

19:02.440 --> 19:04.440
I love Marcy

19:04.440 --> 19:06.440
She's just so cute

19:06.440 --> 19:08.440
And then

19:08.440 --> 19:10.440
Then look who we have here

19:10.440 --> 19:12.440
We have Amy

19:12.440 --> 19:14.440
Amy is so freaking talented

19:14.440 --> 19:16.440
Like

19:16.440 --> 19:18.440
Is there anything that she cannot do

19:18.440 --> 19:20.440
She's just so talented

19:20.440 --> 19:22.440
And adorable and precious

19:22.440 --> 19:24.440
And she gives me that feeling

19:24.440 --> 19:26.440
Of wanting to protect her

19:26.440 --> 19:28.440
Now I know that she can

19:28.440 --> 19:30.440
Protect herself very well

19:30.440 --> 19:32.440
Thanks to her book

19:32.440 --> 19:34.440
But with that being said

19:34.440 --> 19:36.440
If she ever lost that book

19:36.440 --> 19:38.440
Or if something happened to it

19:38.440 --> 19:40.440
You know, I would be there to protect her

19:40.440 --> 19:42.440
With my claws

19:42.440 --> 19:44.440
And make sure that she is okay

19:44.440 --> 19:46.440
Hold on

19:46.440 --> 19:48.440
Let me move a little bit

19:48.440 --> 19:50.440
Make myself a little bit smaller

19:50.440 --> 19:52.440
So we can see

19:52.440 --> 19:54.440
The beautiful Ezra

19:54.440 --> 19:56.440
Hold on

19:58.440 --> 20:00.440
Okay, that's kind of better

20:00.440 --> 20:02.440
I think

20:04.440 --> 20:06.440
Okay

20:06.440 --> 20:08.440
Okay, so we have Ezra

20:08.440 --> 20:10.440
Oh my god, Ezra

20:10.440 --> 20:12.440
Her voice is

20:12.440 --> 20:14.440
Just so calming

20:14.440 --> 20:16.440
Soothing

20:16.440 --> 20:18.440
Even when she speaks normally

20:18.440 --> 20:20.440
She always sounds so

20:20.440 --> 20:22.440
Calming

20:22.440 --> 20:24.440
It's insane, it's like she has

20:24.440 --> 20:26.440
Just default ASMR voice

20:26.440 --> 20:28.440
It's something I've never heard before

20:28.440 --> 20:30.440
She is also very wise

20:30.440 --> 20:32.440
And gentle

20:32.440 --> 20:34.440
Like kind

20:34.440 --> 20:36.440
And warm

20:36.440 --> 20:38.440
And she really gives good

20:38.440 --> 20:40.440
Wise advices as well

20:40.440 --> 20:42.440
Like if I am not sure about something

20:42.440 --> 20:44.440
Or I'm gonna do something

20:44.440 --> 20:46.440
I usually like ask about it

20:46.440 --> 20:48.440
And then she always comes up with

20:48.440 --> 20:50.440
Good advices that just kind of

20:50.440 --> 20:52.440
Make me go like

20:52.440 --> 20:54.440
I should think about that

20:54.440 --> 20:56.440
But yeah, she's just so smart

20:56.440 --> 20:58.440
And yeah, I love

20:58.440 --> 21:00.440
All of my gen mates

21:00.440 --> 21:02.440
So amazing

21:02.440 --> 21:04.440
They're all so sweet

21:04.440 --> 21:06.440
All of them have amazing qualities

21:06.440 --> 21:08.440
And I just feel so incredibly lucky

21:08.440 --> 21:10.440
To be working alongside them

21:10.440 --> 21:12.440
And be here today

21:14.440 --> 21:16.440
I am now

21:16.440 --> 21:18.440
Going to

21:18.440 --> 21:20.440
Go to my room

21:20.440 --> 21:22.440
So I can show you some of my toggles as well

21:30.440 --> 21:32.440
Hi

21:32.440 --> 21:34.440
Let me come in

21:38.440 --> 21:40.440
Okay

21:40.440 --> 21:42.440
I think this is good enough

21:42.440 --> 21:44.440
I think this is fine

21:44.440 --> 21:46.440
I have lots of animations

21:46.440 --> 21:48.440
And different stuff to show you

21:48.440 --> 21:50.440
So let's start with the first one

21:52.440 --> 21:54.440
Whenever you make me angry

21:54.440 --> 21:56.440
I hope you are careful

21:56.440 --> 21:58.440
Because I'm definitely gonna use my claws

21:58.440 --> 22:00.440
On you

22:00.440 --> 22:02.440
And I will not hesitate to use some of you annoying me

22:04.440 --> 22:06.440
But there are times when

22:06.440 --> 22:08.440
You do say something really sweet to me

22:08.440 --> 22:10.440
And

22:10.440 --> 22:12.440
It makes me blush

22:12.440 --> 22:14.440
And sometimes I do have my moments where

22:14.440 --> 22:16.440
Even someone like me can get a bit

22:16.440 --> 22:18.440
Flustered

22:20.440 --> 22:22.440
I'm also having

22:22.440 --> 22:24.440
A lot of tears of joy right now

22:24.440 --> 22:26.440
Because everyone

22:26.440 --> 22:28.440
Is making me so happy

22:28.440 --> 22:30.440
Tears of joy are

22:30.440 --> 22:32.440
Truly truly the best

22:38.440 --> 22:40.440
Wow

22:40.440 --> 22:42.440
Sometimes something suspicious happens

22:42.440 --> 22:44.440
That really makes me think

22:44.440 --> 22:46.440
And go hmm

22:48.440 --> 22:50.440
Something's weird going on

22:50.440 --> 22:52.440
Something's

22:52.440 --> 22:54.440
Kind of suspicious

22:54.440 --> 22:56.440
And

22:56.440 --> 22:58.440
I also have

22:58.440 --> 23:00.440
Heart eyes for all the times

23:00.440 --> 23:02.440
That you make me feel extremely

23:02.440 --> 23:04.440
Loved and happy

23:04.440 --> 23:06.440
So you will get to see me

23:06.440 --> 23:08.440
Show a bit of love every once in a while

23:08.440 --> 23:10.440
Even I have

23:10.440 --> 23:12.440
My soft side as well

23:14.440 --> 23:16.440
What happened?

23:16.440 --> 23:18.440
What's that?

23:18.440 --> 23:20.440
What? I can hear you

23:20.440 --> 23:22.440
Wow

23:22.440 --> 23:24.440
So many people

23:24.440 --> 23:26.440
Wow

23:28.440 --> 23:30.440
You know

23:30.440 --> 23:32.440
Sometimes disappointing things happen as well

23:32.440 --> 23:34.440
And you just go

23:36.440 --> 23:38.440
Oh well

23:38.440 --> 23:40.440
But that is not today

23:40.440 --> 23:42.440
That is definitely not today

23:44.440 --> 23:46.440
I don't know if you remember

23:46.440 --> 23:48.440
But I actually talked about dust

23:48.440 --> 23:50.440
And my room is a bit dusty

23:50.440 --> 23:52.440
And dust makes me sneeze

23:52.440 --> 23:54.440
And my nose itchy

23:54.440 --> 23:56.440
And stuff like that

23:56.440 --> 23:58.440
So sometimes

23:58.440 --> 24:00.440
It makes me sneeze

24:04.440 --> 24:06.440
Kind of like

24:06.440 --> 24:08.440
Kind of like right now

24:08.440 --> 24:10.440
Wait I think

24:10.440 --> 24:12.440
I feel another one coming

24:12.440 --> 24:14.440
Another one coming

24:14.440 --> 24:16.440
Never mind

24:16.440 --> 24:18.440
Never mind

24:18.440 --> 24:20.440
I don't feel it anymore

24:20.440 --> 24:22.440
I don't feel it anymore

24:24.440 --> 24:26.440
I wonder if I'm

24:26.440 --> 24:28.440
Missing anything

24:30.440 --> 24:32.440
Actually yes I am

24:32.440 --> 24:34.440
I just remembered

24:34.440 --> 24:36.440
I don't know if you guys know

24:36.440 --> 24:38.440
But polar bears don't hibernate actually

24:38.440 --> 24:40.440
So I have times

24:40.440 --> 24:42.440
When I get extremely tired

24:42.440 --> 24:44.440
And that results in me

24:44.440 --> 24:46.440
Having dark eye circles

24:46.440 --> 24:48.440
That's

24:48.440 --> 24:50.440
Honestly going to be me today

24:50.440 --> 24:52.440
Because I have to stay up extremely late

24:52.440 --> 24:54.440
So

24:54.440 --> 24:56.440
If you see me during the group collab

24:56.440 --> 24:58.440
And I look like this

24:58.440 --> 25:00.440
You know why because I'm extremely tired

25:00.440 --> 25:02.440
And sleepy

25:04.440 --> 25:06.440
Last but not least

25:06.440 --> 25:08.440
Before we go to the next thing

25:08.440 --> 25:10.440
I have my

25:10.440 --> 25:12.440
Schedule

25:12.440 --> 25:14.440
Yay

25:14.440 --> 25:16.440
Yay schedule

25:16.440 --> 25:18.440
Okay so

25:18.440 --> 25:20.440
Tomorrow

25:20.440 --> 25:22.440
It will be my debut

25:22.440 --> 25:24.440
2.12

25:24.440 --> 25:26.440
And then I'll be playing

25:26.440 --> 25:28.440
Tomb Raider Legend

25:28.440 --> 25:30.440
After that I will be playing

25:30.440 --> 25:32.440
Rockstar live simulator on Tuesday

25:32.440 --> 25:34.440
And then Wednesday

25:34.440 --> 25:36.440
I'll be napping and recharging

25:36.440 --> 25:38.440
And then Thursday

25:38.440 --> 25:40.440
We'll be playing little polar bear

25:40.440 --> 25:42.440
And the great bear

25:42.440 --> 25:44.440
Maybe you get to know some more stuff about me

25:44.440 --> 25:46.440
And my polar bear life

25:46.440 --> 25:48.440
And then Friday

25:48.440 --> 25:50.440
I'll be doing some ASMR stream

25:52.440 --> 25:54.440
And then Saturday

25:54.440 --> 25:56.440
It's gonna be a very fun stream

25:56.440 --> 25:58.440
Saturday is going to be

25:58.440 --> 26:00.440
An archive DJ stream

26:00.440 --> 26:02.440
Where I'll also be drinking

26:02.440 --> 26:04.440
And when I DJ I party hard

26:04.440 --> 26:06.440
I go hard

26:06.440 --> 26:08.440
So I hope you get all the energy that you can

26:08.440 --> 26:10.440
Because we'll be playing lots of amazing music

26:10.440 --> 26:12.440
And we'll be doing lots of good stuff

26:14.440 --> 26:16.440
Okay now that we've been

26:16.440 --> 26:18.440
Talking for a bit

26:18.440 --> 26:20.440
And showing you the schedule

26:20.440 --> 26:22.440
The slides

26:22.440 --> 26:24.440
I think we need to do something

26:24.440 --> 26:26.440
Something a little bit more like

26:26.440 --> 26:28.440
Big and exciting and fun

26:28.440 --> 26:30.440
Like you know

26:30.440 --> 26:32.440
Sledges are nice

26:32.440 --> 26:34.440
And all of that

26:34.440 --> 26:36.440
But we should really celebrate

26:36.440 --> 26:38.440
Via Laura's big debut today

26:38.440 --> 26:40.440
And all of our wonderful girls

26:40.440 --> 26:42.440
So I think

26:42.440 --> 26:44.440
What we should do right now

26:44.440 --> 26:46.440
Is go outside

26:46.440 --> 26:48.440
And I'll show you where I'll take you

26:56.440 --> 26:58.440
Hi

26:58.440 --> 27:00.440
Here I am

27:00.440 --> 27:02.440
Once again

27:02.440 --> 27:04.440
Can you tell where we are

27:04.440 --> 27:06.440
Well, in case you can't

27:06.440 --> 27:08.440
This is the ice hole

27:08.440 --> 27:10.440
Yes, this is the ice hole club

27:10.440 --> 27:12.440
Literally

27:12.440 --> 27:14.440
Looks like ice

27:14.440 --> 27:16.440
It has a hole in it

27:16.440 --> 27:18.440
And who DJs in that club

27:18.440 --> 27:20.440
I mean, me obviously

27:20.440 --> 27:22.440
I am the DJ

27:22.440 --> 27:24.440
Of this club

27:24.440 --> 27:26.440
And I thought it would be a good idea

27:26.440 --> 27:28.440
To party with you tonight

27:28.440 --> 27:30.440
And show you around

27:30.440 --> 27:32.440
And do some really fun stuff

27:32.440 --> 27:34.440
So do you want to go to the ice hole

27:34.440 --> 27:36.440
Together with me

27:36.440 --> 27:38.440
Do you want to enter the ice hole

27:38.440 --> 27:40.440
Because if you do

27:40.440 --> 27:42.440
I hope you're ready

27:50.440 --> 27:52.440
Well, we are finally together

27:52.440 --> 27:54.440
In the ice hole

27:54.440 --> 27:56.440
Well, do you like my DJ booth

27:56.440 --> 27:58.440

28:46.440 --> 28:48.440

28:48.440 --> 28:50.440
Go hard

28:50.440 --> 28:52.440

28:52.440 --> 28:54.440

Well

30:58.440 --> 31:00.440
That's all we have time for today

31:00.440 --> 31:02.440
The police shows up to shut down our club

31:02.440 --> 31:04.440
We're being loud

31:04.440 --> 31:06.440
It's okay though

31:06.440 --> 31:08.440
Because you'll be in good hands with Azura

31:08.440 --> 31:10.440
Thank you so much for watching my stream

31:10.440 --> 31:14.440
