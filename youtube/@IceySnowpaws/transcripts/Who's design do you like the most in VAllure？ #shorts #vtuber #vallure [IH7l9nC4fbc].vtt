00:00.000 --> 00:04.160
All six VLR designs have been revealed, including myself.

00:04.160 --> 00:08.480
It's not traditional for an agency to have six talents for one generation,

00:08.480 --> 00:11.760
but the development team said, and I quote,

00:11.760 --> 00:15.440
there should be one design you naturally gravitate towards.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.200
So, who do you like the most?

00:17.200 --> 00:18.240
Is it Icy?

00:19.520 --> 00:22.320
The insomniac polar bear with scars?

00:22.320 --> 00:27.440
Any the Hexmaniac of the group and the only one of us with a tattoo?

00:27.520 --> 00:32.320
Strony the hypnotizing cuttlefish that's also siren, but can't sing.

00:34.320 --> 00:39.760
Mercy the love-struck yonder, but can't seem to ever love right.

00:39.760 --> 00:45.120
She be the bunny-milk who likes to work hard, but play harder.

00:45.120 --> 00:48.640
And last but certainly not least,

00:48.640 --> 00:54.800
Ezra the goat goddess with milkers bigger than your b**ch.
