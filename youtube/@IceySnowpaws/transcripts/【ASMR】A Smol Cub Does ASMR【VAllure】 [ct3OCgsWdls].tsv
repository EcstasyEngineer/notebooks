330000	334000	You can see if it's going well today's video, see you in the next video!
334000	336000	Thank you for watching, bye!
360000	368000	Hello, my sweet and lovely Snow Berries.
368000	374000	Hello, hello, hello.
374000	378000	I hope you're doing well today.
378000	385000	And if for some reason you're not doing all that great, that's okay.
385000	388000	That's what I mean if what.
389000	391000	I missed you.
391000	395000	It's really good to see all of you here.
395000	400000	Thank you for always keeping me company.
400000	418000	That's very sweet.
418000	424000	I'm glad the feeling is mutual.
425000	436000	I just wanted to say in advance that last stream I had my big window closed.
436000	444000	And today I have it open so that it won't get too hard, too hot.
444000	446000	I can't talk.
448000	451000	So it won't get too hot in my room.
451000	460000	However, with that being said, if it's too loud or too distracting,
460000	467000	please tell me I want to get upset and I will close the big window.
467000	474000	Because you can literally sometimes hear people walking outside.
474000	476000	It's crazy.
476000	480000	This microphone literally picks up everything.
483000	489000	So please do tell me if it ever gets too loud or too annoying.
489000	499000	Because I want the ASMR to be as comfy as it can be.
500000	502000	Yeah.
503000	512000	Also, I saw a comment on my last ASMR thought that
512000	517000	they don't know if I do this intentionally or not.
517000	526000	That I usually focus a lot on one ear and if it was intentional.
526000	535000	So the answer is no, it's not intentional.
535000	541000	I generally just forget to switch between the ears.
541000	546000	So if you ever feel that I talk for too long in one ear,
546000	552000	don't hesitate to remind me to switch between them.
552000	560000	So that I can make the experience better for you.
583000	585000	Okay.
598000	604000	You have all been so kind and sweet to me.
604000	610000	It's been really overwhelming, but not in a bad way.
610000	615000	Like in a good way, but still overwhelming.
615000	622000	So it's something that I'll have to get used to.
622000	625000	I guess it's very new to me.
626000	632000	But I don't want to say that I appreciate it so much.
632000	636000	You've all been so sweet and kind to me.
636000	641000	And there's really not enough words to express.
644000	647000	Just, I don't know, just so much.
647000	649000	I appreciate it.
650000	654000	Thank you. You're being all just too kind to me.
654000	662000	I don't know what I did to deserve such nice treatment from you, but
662000	668000	I'm glad that you think I'm worth it either way.
680000	685000	Lots of emotions for a little cutie.
685000	689000	Yeah, I feel my emotions very strongly.
689000	697000	So I apologize if sometimes the things I say sound weird,
697000	700000	or we're like, I'm yapping too much.
700000	704000	I feel like I've been yapping way too much today.
704000	707000	But at the same time, just I can help it.
707000	712000	I really want you all to know just how much it means to me.
712000	717000	But if you like, no matter how many things I write or say,
717000	727000	it's never going to really be enough to truly describe how I feel about all of this.
734000	736000	Thank you.
748000	751000	I did love you, Ozzy. Good job, yapping too much.
751000	754000	Thank you. How's it going, sir?
764000	780000	I brought some, you stopped today, some additional triggers that I think
780000	786000	could sound potentially good for today's stream.
787000	795000	So one of the things that I brought is a cat toy that I have,
795000	799000	and it makes some really, really nice crinkly sounds.
801000	805000	And I really enjoy sounds like that, so I thought,
805000	810000	well, how did I not think about last stream?
812000	815000	Let's make some nice sounds with it.
817000	819000	Here.
832000	836000	Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.
837000	840000	Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.
845000	848000	You have a cat. I have two cats.
848000	851000	Yeah, I have two cats.
866000	871000	Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.
881000	883000	Crinkle.
885000	887000	Crinkle.
888000	890000	Crinkle.
902000	905000	Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.
906000	909000	What are your cat's names if you don't mind me asking?
910000	914000	One of them is Bucklush.
915000	918000	And the second one is Potato.
920000	924000	Bucklush has been really whiny and needy today.
927000	932000	Like, I initially closed the door and he was like
932000	936000	moving with his paws and like whining and stuff.
937000	939000	But he's okay now.
940000	942000	He's just super whiny.
942000	948000	So I don't want him to be super loud and whiny in your ears.
952000	954000	He's a very good boy.
956000	960000	But really whiny and vocal, but super cute.
960000	967000	And Potato is really tiny and she is this cute funny little gremlin.
967000	972000	They're both really cute gremlins. I love them both.
997000	1009000	This toy also has a soft texture on top of it.
1011000	1015000	So when I move it against your ears like this,
1015000	1020000	it can cause fun. It feels soft against the ear.
1027000	1028000	Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
1058000	1062160	oh
1062160	1075160	okay
1075160	1077660	was never interested in ASMR
1077660	1080160	but you make it so comfy
1080160	1083160	ah, thank you
1083160	1084160	I'm flattered

1551040	1554040	How are these days, by the way? Are you doing fine?
1554040	1558040	I'm doing more than fine, I'm doing amazing, to be honest.
1559040	1564040	It's been just one week, but it was the best week ever.
1566040	1572040	I don't know, it's been so crazy, but every day has been genuinely just so great.
1577040	1579040	I'm sorry, I apologize.
1589040	1591040	I'm sorry.
1611040	1616040	I remember how nervous you were before the video.
1616040	1619040	Yeah, I was extremely nervous.
1619040	1625040	When I was done with the video, I was legitimately shaking.
1625040	1630040	My whole body was buzzing and shaking.
1646040	1649040	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
1676040	1686040	I'm glad you're here, I'm glad to be here.
1688040	1692040	I'm very happy to be here, and I feel very lucky.
1692040	1695040	I feel very lucky too.
1696040	1699040	I feel so lucky that it's only been a weekend.
1700040	1708040	I already have so many nice and kind people here with me.
1708040	1713040	I don't know, it feels so real, it feels like a dream.
1714040	1718040	But it's a dream that became a reality.
1719040	1728040	It's like that one meme that I saw before I joined the L.R.
1728040	1738040	And it was like, a girl wakes up one day and realizes she's living her dream.
1738040	1747040	And that's how I feel, I wake up and I'm like, wow, my dream is amazing.
1748040	1752040	My reality, that's so magical, you know.
1752040	1756040	I think it's just so cool.
1771040	1775040	Let me play around with some other triggers.
1776040	1784040	It's like a bunch of paper strings or something like that.
1786040	1790040	So I thought maybe I could try making some sounds with it.
1791040	1793040	Rather variety.
1797040	1800040	Some of them are falling out of my hand.
1800040	1805040	That's probably gonna make a mess, but it's okay.
1807040	1809040	As long as it makes nice sounds.
1810040	1812040	Hopefully it does.
1830040	1832040	I love it when you say mister.
1834040	1839040	It can help that my mister's are so kind to me and so loving.
1839040	1841040	Love you mister.
1860040	1879040	Yeah, this is one of the new triggers, yeah, it is.
1890040	1912040	Sometimes I feel self-conscious about being older, but you still like me.
1912040	1914040	Of course I like you, what do you mean?
1914040	1916040	What do you mean, of course?
1917040	1921040	And I mean, being older is not a bad thing, I think.
1922040	1925040	I think that's a nice thing, if anything.
1929040	1935040	I think being older does add to it in some ways.
1936040	1943040	But I think it's also about the way your soul is.
1944040	1952040	Your age could be maybe not older or anything, but you have an old soul, if that makes sense.
1953040	1959040	So in either scenario, it works.
1960040	1962040	I love all my mister's.
1966040	1967040	Okay.
1967040	1992040	As for the tip that you just mentioned that I missed,
1992040	2000040	I always read any donations or tips at the end of every stream.
2001040	2006040	So I will do that towards the end of the stream, don't worry.
2018040	2020040	I love you mister.
2023040	2036040	If the spring's a love for me, then I'm gonna put them back for now.
2041040	2044040	Nice spring's everywhere.
2045040	2049040	Thank you.
2050040	2054040	Let me see my comfort rate.
2055040	2061040	I'm not in the next comfort right now.
2064040	2066040	Those cables are everywhere.
2067040	2083040	They have two stones or minerals, whatever you wanna call them.
2084040	2089040	I thought that they would make for nice sounds.
2090040	2094040	One of them is blue and the other one is green.
2095040	2099040	I don't remember what their names are.
2100040	2102040	I'm too down to remember.
2103040	2105040	My memory is pretty bad.
2106040	2113040	But I hope you will like the sounds that they make together.
2124040	2126040	Thank you.
2154040	2156040	Thank you.
2185040	2186040	Thank you.

2216040	2220040	Here I'm gonna get some hugs and cuddles today.
2222040	2224040	Just like last week.
2247040	2249040	Sorry for muting.
2250040	2253040	My throat felt scratchy and I had to cough.
2276040	2285040	No worries, I'm not sick.
2286040	2291040	My throat just felt itchy or scratchy for some reason.
2292040	2295040	So I had to cough it up basically.
2295040	2297040	I'm glad you do.
2298040	2313040	Don't hesitate to ask for previous triggers that I have already done during this stream.
2314040	2317040	If you want to hear more of them, that's completely fine.
2325040	2327040	Thank you very much.

2798260	2799660	我 God アンケ edition of01!
2799660	2800820	Can I get a verse again?
2800820	2830820	I don't blame you, this has been me, like every day, like I feel butterflies somewhat lately with just how loving and sweet mister is to me, I admit sometimes there's moments where like even one
2830820	2859820	to maybe call you Dada or you know other stuff but I guess really embarrassed about it and shy and I also don't want to make it weird so for now I just stick to ojizan and mister and you know snow pairing but sometimes I have like I just do all you boy other stuff too but
2860820	2877820	I hold myself back because I get really shy and embarrassed so maybe at some point I will but I'm really embarrassed right now
2877820	2897820	for now it's gonna be like this but I just wanted to tell you about it just to you know let it out and tell you how I felt
2908820	2923820	is there any pet names you like, like cutie or kitten or darling?
2924820	2935820	I really like just having the word little at it so let me like little icy, it's cute
2937820	2939820	I think it's cute doesn't it?
2940820	2941820	just um
2948820	2949820	oh god
2951820	2958820	I feel that's like one of my big favorites, darling is good as well, darling is cute too
2962820	2964820	or baby icy
2965820	2974820	I don't know why I just embarrassed about it but I'm like all blushing right now
2988820	2991820	icy little boys, it's really cute
2994820	2995820	it's really cute
3007820	3008820	you're my baby darling
3011820	3012820	that's really cute
3016820	3020820	so I'm getting really flustered
3025820	3032820	I have a small box here and it has something in it but
3033820	3042820	but I don't know if I should do anything about it
3043820	3045820	but it's really cute
3046820	3053820	I have a small box here and it has something in it
3053820	3054820	but
3059820	3065820	but I don't know if I should do any like triggers or anything with it
3070820	3072820	I feel embarrassed
3074820	3076820	but can you guess what it is?
3078820	3079820	what's in the box?
3083820	3084820	what's in the box?
3098820	3099820	is it toy?
3100820	3104820	not necessarily no, I wouldn't really say it's a toy no
3107820	3109820	yes, a best find
3110820	3112820	how did you know?
3113820	3115820	how did you know what the egg?
3119820	3128820	it has a really cute pacifier that one of my masters got me from the farm
3130820	3136820	so I've been wondering if I should use it as a striker or something like that
3137820	3143820	but I don't know if that would be like really weird or if it's, I don't know
3143820	3146820	I just feel really shy the best
3147820	3148820	ah
3161820	3164820	I already said no, I'm sorry
3165820	3167820	but I'm shy
3168820	3171820	I really am embarrassed
3171820	3173820	I don't know
3174820	3176820	I don't know
3181820	3186820	it would be funny if I have the best seat and I try to talk
3187820	3189820	I think that would be funny
3191820	3193820	without opening it
3194820	3196820	it's not a way to make it weird
3196820	3198820	but I'm sorry ok, I'm really embarrassed
3204820	3206820	I don't know, I'm so embarrassed
3206820	3208820	I don't know
3209820	3211820	oh, it's so cute though
3212820	3214820	it's so cute though
3214820	3221820	it has a moon and a polar bear with a heart and ribbons
3221820	3224820	and it is cute on it
3224820	3227820	and it has like a candy
3228820	3230820	like stuff and like
3231820	3235820	like lots of like shiny sparkly things on it
3236820	3240820	and it's really really cute
3252820	3255820	I really love the way that it looks, it's so freaking cute
3261820	3262820	ah
3271820	3275820	I'm kinda wondering if I could maybe
3275820	3278820	actually like take a picture of it
3278820	3280820	and then cut it out
3280820	3285820	and use it like as an on-stream asset
3285820	3291820	basically have it used on my model as well
3292820	3294820	I think that would be really cute
3296820	3299820	and more immersive maybe
3299820	3301820	I don't know
3308820	3311820	like a toggle, yeah, something like that

3885000	3891000	I'm trying to remember what other triggers I did last time.
3891000	3895000	But my memory is so bad.
3895000	3905000	I didn't know that I can remember if there was more stuff that I did last time.
3905000	3911000	I don't know if I remember what other triggers I did last time.
3911000	3917000	But I don't know if I remember what other triggers I did last time.
3917000	3923000	I don't know if I remember what other triggers I did last time.
3923000	3927000	But yeah, that's true. I was tapping the microphone yesterday.
3927000	3931000	Not yesterday, but last time somewhere strange.
3931000	3935000	I was tapping the microphone yesterday.
3935000	3939000	I was tapping the microphone yesterday.
3939000	3943000	I was tapping the microphone yesterday.
3943000	3947000	I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

3971000	3975000	I was tapping the microphone yesterday.
3975000	3979000	I was tapping the microphone yesterday.
3979000	3983000	I was tapping the microphone yesterday.
3983000	4001000	I remember when I heard this trigger for the first time that someone was scratching against the radio mic.
4001000	4005000	I felt so many details. It was crazy.
4005000	4015000	It really sucks how rarely I get tingles now.
4015000	4027000	In the first year or two that I got into ASMR, I got tingles so often and so much of it.
4027000	4031000	But it's really rare now.
4031000	4035000	Can I try saying coconut?
4035000	4037000	Okay.
4037000	4039000	Coconut.
4041000	4043000	Coconut.
4045000	4047000	Coconut.
4061000	4069000	Yeah, you just said that the sun is nice.
4069000	4073000	Yeah, it's sad really.
4073000	4079000	I still get tingles here and there but it's rare and it makes me sad.
4079000	4083000	Because it feels so nice.
4091000	4117000	Oh, I know. Maybe this will make a good sound. It's like a sticker.
4117000	4123000	Oh, I know. Maybe this will make a good sound. It's like a sticker.
4123000	4127000	Or maybe not. Maybe I'm just stupid.
4137000	4141000	I don't know if that sounds good or not. I can't tell.
4147000	4163000	It's so cute with these tumbles over her words.
4163000	4171000	It's almost just really hard for her to say no.
4171000	4179000	Okay, how are we feeling about this sticker trigger?
4179000	4187000	Is it any good? Or is it like, man, whatever?
4187000	4203000	It's like, man, I wish it was more sticky.
4203000	4227000	Maybe mister can help me make this sticker more sticky.
4227000	4237000	What about this sound?
4237000	4251000	Is this any good?
4251000	4265000	I don't know where it pleases you but I want to please mister. That's important.
4265000	4269000	Maybe with some kind of tape.
4269000	4275000	There are bits to gear. I would try that.
4275000	4285000	Okay, let's start with the other ear.
4285000	4301000	I don't know if I can see them better.
4301000	4305000	We are not decent anymore, mister. You're both.
4305000	4315000	It just depends on what I feel like calling you in the moment.
4315000	4321000	That's really weird. I feel like this sticker doesn't really stick much in this ear.
4321000	4333000	Because it sounded a lot better in the other ear. More sticky.
4333000	4341000	I think it is a spaghetti. Spaghetti. Spaghetti.
4363000	4383000	I don't think I feel safe putting this sticker anywhere near my skin if you know what I mean.
4393000	4407000	Okay, let's start with the other ear.
4407000	4423000	Okay, let's start with the other ear.
4423000	4443000	Okay, let's start with the other ear.
4443000	4463000	Okay, let's start with the other ear.
4463000	4487000	Okay.
4487000	4515000	Okay.
4515000	4533000	Yes, yes, yes.
4533000	4555000	Okay, let's start with the other ear.
4555000	4579000	Yes, yes, yes.
4579000	4605000	Yes, yes, yes.
4605000	4629000	I love you.
4629000	4641000	I had bubble wrap like a few weeks ago, but I don't have it anymore.
4641000	4663000	But I promise whenever I do get bubble wrap in any of my packages, I'll be sure to save it and use it as a trigger for my ASMR streams.
4663000	4685000	Yes, yes, yes.
4685000	4709000	Yes, yes, yes.
4709000	4737000	Yes, yes, yes.
4737000	4765000	I'm going to do a little bit of sniffing since I did the last stream as well.
4765000	4781000	Sniffing.
4781000	4809000	What is sniffing so happily? You, of course, silly.
4809000	4827000	Sniffing.
4827000	4843000	The smell of a snow fairy. My favorite.
4843000	4869000	You stink very nice.
4869000	4871000	My favorite smell.
4871000	4881000	Sniffing.
4881000	4905000	Sniffing.
4905000	4933000	Sniffing.
4933000	4953000	Sniffing.
4953000	4981000	Sniffing.
4981000	5001000	Sniffing.
5001000	5029000	Sniffing.
5029000	5037000	Sniffing.
5037000	5063000	Sniffing.
5063000	5073000	Sniffing.
5073000	5083000	Let me give you a hug. I think you deserve a nice warm hug. Come here.
5083000	5095000	Come here, my beloved. You deserve some nice nice hugs to get you feel relaxed and loved and nice.
5095000	5113000	Sniffing.
5113000	5121000	I love you, snow fairy. So, so much.
5121000	5145000	You deserve all the hugs in the world. You deserve to get some nice warm cuddles after a hard day of work.
5145000	5165000	Snow fairy has been working so hard for me. It's so sweet, aren't you? The sweetest in the world. I love you so, so much.
5165000	5181000	I love you.
5181000	5205000	It feels nice cuddling you like this. So nice and comfy.
5205000	5217000	Wishing I could clone herself like she tweeted so I could have icy hugs for real. We all need an icy. I feel the same.
5217000	5231000	It makes me sad when I think about it too deeply. I try not to overthink it, but I don't know. I gotta help with it today.
5231000	5245000	And I just felt like really sad and was like, man, if I could clone myself for this reason, I would.
5245000	5255000	Would you cuddle with your clone self? No, that would be weird.
5255000	5271000	Would you make us happy if that's all that matters? Yeah, but I want to make you even happier, you know?
5271000	5287000	And I think about it like, I still feel like I want to be able to make you happier, but like I also, I don't know, just makes me a little sad, I guess.
5287000	5299000	But I should stop thinking about it and enjoy what we have.
5299000	5305000	That question would you cuddle with your model if it was real?
5306000	5320000	I don't know how to answer this question because my model is me, you know? Like I see is me and I am icy, you know?
5320000	5337000	So, I don't even know how to answer this question because it's literally me. It's literally me, so like, I don't know how to answer it.
5338000	5356000	I think we already are happy. Then offer to yourself for a sake, okay? I'll try. I'll try.
5357000	5365000	I'll offer my best to you to make you as happy as I can within my ability.
5374000	5381000	Have you enjoyed that nice cuddle we had? I know I did.
5386000	5415000	Let's stay out with you, Rocky, during the stream. I mean, then do you...
5415000	5425000	As always. Like I said, during summer, when it's hot, I just wear panties. That's it.
5425000	5434000	What color?
5434000	5444000	I posted it on my old Twitter, actually. A picture of the panties. I posted it on my old Twitter.
5444000	5450000	Some of you probably have seen it. Nothing else. Yeah, nothing else.
5450000	5468000	I feel like that's normal for me, anyways. Like, it's summer, but while they wear anything else, I'm in my own space, I'm not outside or anything.
5481000	5495000	I'm not gonna get a cold, the weather is hot.
5495000	5522000	I don't wear socks around. I wear slippers. Have, like, really cute reindeer slippers that I wear around the house. They very soft and comfy to wear.
5525000	5554000	Let me know what you think of this sound. Is it any good or not?
5555000	5584000	Yeah, it's good.
5584000	5613000	I feel like I really need some time to establish myself and get into the growth of things, especially now that I'm overwhelmed with all the support and attention I've been getting in the future.
5614000	5627000	Maybe, I don't know, it might happen if it depends how I feel a while from now.
5627000	5633000	Can we get some cows later? Yeah, yeah, of course, definitely.
5634000	5646000	I don't feel pressured to do anything you're not ready for. Yeah, thank you for understanding. I definitely only want to do stuff that I feel comfortable doing.
5646000	5663000	But, you know, it doesn't mean it will never happen. Like, there's always the possibility that something's gonna happen. You live and you see what happens.
5663000	5671000	Wait, Ben, there's only no bra. I don't need a bra.
5693000	5722000	I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra.
5723000	5747000	I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra.
5747000	5760000	As I plan to be an ASMR tomorrow as well or on Thursday tomorrow, there will be another ASMR stream tomorrow as well. Back to back.
5777000	5806000	ASMR. Thank you.
5806000	5812000	I just sleep in bed naked. No, not fully naked. Just with my panties.
5812000	5830000	But yeah, I feel like ASMR streams are definitely very nice for the days where I don't really feel like playing anything, you know?
5830000	5847000	And I just want to in bed and just relax together with you and just be comfy together, comfy quality. I can't talk. Comfy, quality time together.
5848000	5867000	I see do you play any instruments? No, I don't. I used to have a kalimba, a small one.
5868000	5879000	And I used to use a Disney smart trigger and play it sometimes, but I never played any actual songs or anything like that.
5879000	5898000	I just randomly pressed it in whatever sounded good to me, I guess. I freestyled the kalimba because that's how I enjoyed doing it the most.
5898000	5925000	What's your favorite ASMR trigger? I actually really love visual ASMR triggers, so I really enjoy triggers where there's like hand movements or bright lights and stuff like that.
5925000	5940000	Combined with whispers, there's something really calming about it. I just used to play piano. Oh, that's so cool. That's really nice.
5941000	5955000	That makes me think of a memory that I have. I remember when I was a little younger, I had a friend and me and her would sometimes go to the mall together.
5955000	5971000	And the mall had this big piano store. And in the piano store, they had actually headphones plugged into the piano so you could sit and play it.
5971000	5991000	And obviously, I don't know how to play the piano, but I would sometimes go to that store, sit and just make up my own melodies for like a while.
5992000	6000000	Sometimes I would sit there for like 20 minutes or something because it was just like a really fun thing to do.
6001000	6023000	Sculpt massage is 10 out of 10. Actually, I think I might be able to do a sculpt massage. I have a wig, so I think if I put the wig on the 3DO and I scratched the top of it, maybe it would feel or sound like head scratches.
6024000	6026000	I would say I hope so.
6031000	6036000	Maybe you just will have to pick a piano again, learn a song for you.
6039000	6046000	Oh, that's so sweet. That's really sweet.
6053000	6063000	I don't know why it makes me want to peer up, but I think that's really sweet. Thank you.
6064000	6074000	Can you try hair brushing with it, too? It's such a very trigger brush, so comfy.
6074000	6081000	Do you mean like get a hair brush and brush the wig hair? Is that what you mean?
6081000	6089000	Because yeah, definitely something that I would do. I think that would be really nice.
6089000	6108000	Let's see. I have some scissors here. I want to see if it would make for good sounds. So let me know what you think.
6120000	6135000	Snip, snip, snip, snip. Don't worry. I'm always snipping away the dead ends, so your hair...
6135000	6143000	Fuck, I can't talk because that's so stupid. So your hair can grow healthy.
6150000	6156000	Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip.
6160000	6173000	You know what else I like to do? Sometimes I like to use scissors for ASMR, but not for hair cutting.
6174000	6194000	For cutting away negative energy. So if snowberries are feeling a bit down or tired, I'm going to snip it all away, and you're going to feel much better after it.
6194000	6203000	I know it sounds kind of silly, but I like to think of it that way sometimes.
6224000	6229000	Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip.
6254000	6269000	Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip.
6269000	6296000	Lemonade audio for your decent. I mean, yeah, I could, but I guess my thought pattern about it is like, well, I've already made two of them,
6297000	6301000	so I feel like if I make a third one, then it's boring.
6302000	6312000	Like, I don't know what would make it better.
6314000	6323000	I don't want to just upload a bunch of lemonade sounds every day because I mean, that's just going to be boring.
6326000	6333000	I think I'm going to get cat noises, meow somewhere, meow.
6340000	6349000	Wait, you did too? Yeah, I did too. If you go through my media, you will find the second one or just scroll down.
6357000	6366000	It's not boring, just boost up what you're doing at the time, doing a random stream.
6367000	6371000	Maybe, maybe I'll do that. Maybe I'll do that.
6387000	6399000	Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snipe, snip
6401000	6407000	Snipe, snipe, snipe, snipe, snip, snip, snipe, snip, snip, snip
6407000	6414640	All right, someone asked if I can do some yawing or yaw sounds.
6437000	6467000	yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, y
6467000	6485280	yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw,
6515280	6545280	ха-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-
6545280	6575280	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
6575280	6604280	Because I feel bad if when I raid, if there's people that are asleep, or are really comfy, will get like jump scared, and I don't want that, and I did raid Stranny last days in my stream, but I don't know how.
6605780	6615280	How you feel? I guess I feel bad for the people that might get jump scared, cause I don't know.
6615280	6642280	I don't know. I'll try to duck louder towards the end of the stream, like last ASMR stream.
6646280	6657280	What is Mano raid? I don't know what that is. Oh no, it's people talking outside.
6666280	6671280	Sorry, people talking outside.
6675280	6693280	I don't know. I would feel like too shy to raid anyone else. That's not my gen mates, so there's bad too.
6694280	6704280	I mostly just keep to myself, and I'm only more comfy around my gen mates.
6706280	6714280	But I will talk a bit louder, or let no one advance towards the end of the stream like I did.
6716280	6718280	Anyways, let me drink some water.
6723280	6752280	I'm too shy for that. I'm really bad with initiating with the people.
6753280	6762280	And even with my gen mates, a lot of times I don't initiate conversations. Just how my brain is, I guess.
6765280	6772280	I say can you try finger flattering? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's do some finger flattering.
6813280	6842280	What the fuck is that question? What? What is the power of something so what?
6843280	6852280	I'm sorry, but I have literally no idea what that question means. I literally do not understand what.
6862280	6865280	I don't know what this word means either.
6866280	6885280	I'm sorry, I don't know. I have no idea what this is. I've never seen that meme, so I don't know.
6886280	6901280	The biology meme? Well, I'm just stupid, so you can't give me memes about any science or biology or any of that, because I'm just a baby.
6904280	6908280	I'm just a little baby. I don't know what any of that stuff.
6916280	6936280	The only biology you need to know is what it is that you just see personally.
6936280	6942280	True, that all that really matters, I agree.
6966280	6969280	I'm sorry.
6997280	6999280	I'm sorry.
6999280	7001280	I'm sorry.
7024280	7026280	I'm sorry.
7030280	7032280	I'm sorry.
7044280	7052280	I'm sorry, because I have a death in my mouth. That's why I'm sorry.
7059280	7061280	I'm sorry.
7061280	7063280	I'm sorry.
7086280	7088280	I love you so much.
7089280	7092280	I love you so very much.
7092280	7094280	I love you so very much.
7110280	7112280	I love you so very much.
7123280	7126280	I love you so very much.
7126280	7128280	I love you so very much.
7141280	7143280	I love you so very much.
7153280	7155280	I love you so very much.
7173280	7175280	I love you so very much.
7182280	7184280	I love you so very much.
7196280	7198280	I love you so very much.
7212280	7214280	I love you so very much.
7222280	7224280	I'm so embarrassed.
7227280	7231280	Someone said I sound like a nerd.
7236280	7238280	I know it's your way.
7242280	7246280	Snow bears would hate me now because it sounds like a nerd.
7246280	7249280	When I have my passion, you aren't the one.
7256280	7260280	I want to sound cute, but if I don't sound cute,
7260280	7264280	when I use the pacifier, I won't use it.
7273280	7277280	Snow bears would hate me now because it sounds like a nerd.
7287280	7290280	I love you so very much.
7302280	7304280	I love you so very much.
7310280	7312280	I love you so very much.
7332280	7335280	I love you so very much.
7362280	7364280	I love you so very much.
7379280	7381280	I love you so very much.
7389280	7391280	I love you so very much.
7393280	7397280	Even if the fart gets taken down,
7397280	7400280	if someone archives this stream,
7401280	7406280	I will tweet the link to the archive.
7408280	7410280	Just don't worry.
7423280	7425280	I love you so very much.
7429280	7431280	I love you so very much.
7431280	7433280	I love you so very much.
7452280	7454280	I love you so very much.
7477280	7479280	I love you so very much.
7482280	7484280	I'm very joy with
7485280	7488280	the little magic tub.
7488280	7490280	Oh no.
7490280	7492280	It's so much fun.
7493280	7494280	Shut up.
7494280	7496280	I'm the only baby here.
7503280	7505280	I'm the only baby.
7506280	7507280	Shut up.
7508280	7510280	I'm the only baby here.
7513280	7515280	I'm the only baby here.
7527280	7529280	I'm the only baby here.
7532280	7533280	No.
7533280	7534280	Ew.
7535280	7536280	No.
7536280	7538280	It's from the outside.
7539280	7540280	I told you.
7541280	7542280	It's from the outside.
7542280	7545280	Because my mic picks up everything from the outside.
7546280	7547280	Ew.
7547280	7548280	I don't have kids.
7550280	7551280	No.
7552280	7554280	It's from the outside.
7555280	7557280	I'm the only baby here.
7558280	7560280	I'm the only baby here.
7569280	7570280	No.
7570280	7572280	I'm the only kid.
