next time i will definitely go to kenapi

09:45.400 --> 09:49.480
earlier because this was really close

09:52.040 --> 09:58.280
yeah so today we're going to be playing tomb raider legend

09:59.160 --> 10:07.480
it's one of my most favorite games i love all of the tomb raider games from the very first one

10:08.440 --> 10:17.240
and the thing with this game is that i can't remember exactly but i think

10:18.440 --> 10:29.720
it it released after angel of darkness if i'm if i'm correct and and back then when tomb raider

10:29.720 --> 10:39.000
legend got released it was like really like this big thing because the graphics were like completely

10:39.000 --> 10:49.000
like uh different and much more realistic and it was like this really really uh big thing

10:49.000 --> 10:58.200
you know i would like go um i would basically go on forums and stuff like that for tomb raider community

10:58.200 --> 11:05.800
and stuff and we would all like post like uh screenshots from the game whenever they would give

11:05.800 --> 11:12.760
like an update or a trailer about this game and we would all like talk about it and how cool

11:12.760 --> 11:22.680
each area looks and just it was just a whole another time you know um so i really wanted to

11:23.640 --> 11:29.480
um play this game today while you're here because uh it's definitely one of my favorites

11:29.480 --> 11:41.560
i really love it because it's also uh for someone like me it's easier than that all the older

11:41.560 --> 11:47.400
tomb raider games because it was easier to navigate or like figure out where to go and stuff like

11:47.400 --> 11:53.960
that but but yeah yeah yeah i'm gonna stop yapping i'm gonna stop yapping and i am going to

11:55.880 --> 12:02.520
uh start the game and when i start the game please let me know if the sound is too loud

12:03.320 --> 12:09.960
let me know if you can see everything and if the sound is too loud or anything i'm gonna have to

12:09.960 --> 12:17.080
close the game again because when you try to tap out of this game it just shits itself and

12:17.560 --> 12:26.760
freezes so you have to fully close it and reopen it so uh what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna mute the bgm

12:29.480 --> 12:38.040
uh i'm gonna set this thing over here for the sound of the game

12:38.040 --> 12:49.880
um now let me open the game and then once i'm in the game uh just just let me know if there's

12:49.880 --> 13:00.120
anything you want me to change blah blah blah blah okay hopefully hopefully this works

13:00.760 --> 13:02.200

flare's too hot for icy i want more flares i really like the red lighting that they give

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.840
so i'm sad that i don't have more

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.840
while he's dead

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:36.120
oh no no no it's my inner demons

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:48.440
um um um okay okay um

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:58.440
that was such a weird angle that was so awkward to do oh okay where am i

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:04.280
have i been here before no

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:10.280
okay there is a ball here what are what do we need it for

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:17.640
are some one of these things put that ball down here

01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:27.960
we're balling we're balling we're balling tonight

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:36.920
he likes to ball with me he wants to go balling with me okay enough with the dramatic music

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:45.560
okay please just just let me think let me think here you go here

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:56.120
yeah it's your fault it's probably your fault

01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:59.320
why did you drag us in here

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:22.680
i see how tired are you um i'm okay i'm okay i'm definitely less tired than i was

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:28.600
at the start uh when i started the stream i was very sleepy because i was

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:37.160
still waking up from a nappy but the more i'm playing this the more i'm like getting into the game

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:44.360
how much did you sleep uh i napped for

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:56.120
for two hours i know a lot of you are probably gonna be like i see a nap is not two hours okay

01:26:56.120 --> 01:27:03.160
a nap is like 10 minutes maybe 15 but you don't understand for me naps are

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:13.000
anywhere from one to three or four hours that's just the way i am okay that's my kind of nap

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:19.160
okay i guess we'll go back here

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:31.480
ice an app is not two hours i was like 10 minutes maybe 15 while for you maybe for you

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:42.840
an app is 15 minutes but for me a polar bear an app can take anywhere between two to four hours

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.840
and that that's just the way it is for polar bears

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:57.960
we don't hibernate so we need to take very long naps in between the day to keep our energy

01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:04.680
levels up the door might be trapped we're trapped she might be producing hibernation yeah something like

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:21.000
that exactly something like that micro dosing hibernation yeah

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.320
come on

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:39.320
producing all of my strength come on Amanda get out of there i only have limited strength come on

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:41.320
come on

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:48.520
it's over

01:28:51.400 --> 01:29:02.360
nap stream when maybe during asmr sometimes when i do asmr i get really sleepy while i do it

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:10.840
so maybe we could have an asmr stream where i do asmr and then in the middle of it in the middle

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:17.960
of the stream i nap for a few minutes and you can like listen to my heartbeat or something while i nap

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:21.160
i don't know we'll figure it out

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:30.520
to be perfectly honest i think this is a terrible idea everyone agreed to leave things as they were

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:37.080
i will as much as i can but from what rottland said i'm sure there's a clue down there about what killed my

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:44.280
mother i have to go back there's no use trying to enter at this same point it's getting

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:51.640
in the river had to get in there somehow i leave you to forget snow bears do asmr for i see

01:29:52.360 --> 01:30:02.360
no that that's not what i meant i'm still the one doing the asmr but like when i do asmr it

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:09.960
calms me down as well as i do it and then it makes me sleepy as a result the water i hope if you get a call

01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:14.040
from an eye patch her through straight away i'm a little concerned about leaving her by herself

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:23.320
heartbeat asmr forbidden tommy noises oh god please please please don't remind me of tommy noises

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:30.440
uh that's you just reminded me one of the things that i hate the most about doing asmr is when

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:38.200
my tommy like grumbles or makes sounds it's so embarrassing that's like my least favorite part about

01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:40.120
doing asmr

01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:50.280
okay but what do i do what do i do i um i think i need to use my grenade

01:30:53.880 --> 01:31:02.520
no okay i thought i could use my grenade okay maybe that's not the way maybe that's not the way

01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:07.160
tommy noises are so cute no they're not they're embarrassing

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:14.600
i don't want disgusting a decent listen to my tommy making weird sounds that's so gross

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:23.240
oh god oh i'm scared

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:30.840

01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:00.120

01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:36.420
good swimmer but still needs to breathe

01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:38.420
yeah

01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:42.420
okay I'm confused as of

01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:47.420
in what order I need to do this

01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:51.420
I thought originally there's no order

01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:54.420
and I'm fine

01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:58.420
but that doesn't seem to be the case

01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:07.420
come on, come on

01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:11.420
come on, come on

01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:13.420
do I need to do it maybe fast enough?

01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:16.420
I'm kinda wondering if that's the case

01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:19.420
do I do it?

01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:21.420
I do it

01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:23.420
come on

01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:27.420
nice! I did it! I did it!

01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:30.420
okay I just needed to do it really fast

01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:33.420
I just needed to do it very very fast

01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:35.420
okay

01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:39.420
that makes sense

01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:45.420
okay I made it

01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:50.420
look at me girl

01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:53.420
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:03.420
is that what I think it is?

01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:05.420
yeah it's a shoe

01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:07.420
it was Amanda's

01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:10.420
I doubt so fall off your feet bad easy

01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:12.420
it's been unlaced

01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:15.420
I never imagined she could have survived

01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:18.420
there was a loss of water

01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:20.420
she still might not have

01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:27.420
okay we are finally out of the water

01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:29.420
thank god

01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:31.420
ah

01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:37.420
finally out of the water don't need to worry about

01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:40.420
drowning anymore

01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:41.420
okay

01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:44.420
okay

01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:49.420
where do I go? I think I go this way

01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:51.420
I hope

01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:53.420
okay

01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:58.420
it's story time

01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:01.420
haha

01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:09.420
hmm my ears

01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:20.420
do you still find swimming relaxing?

01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:25.420
yeah when I don't have to go underneath it for too long

01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:27.420
that's when

01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:30.420
that's why I do enjoy it

01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:42.420
when Edamata gave Lara Ice's hair and ears

01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:44.420
that would be so cool

01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:47.420
oh my god that would be so cool

01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:50.420
I think that would be so cute if it was possible

01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:53.420
oh my god imagine

01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:55.420
that would be amazing

01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:57.420
oh my face

01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:07.420
okay where do I go?

01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:10.420
nah I go here

01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:13.420
models do you hear me?

01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:18.420
okay I think I go here

01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:20.420
and go here

01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:23.420
and go here

01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:27.420
okay okay I'm doing good I'm doing good

01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:30.420

why that happen?

01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:42.420
why did it break? that doesn't make any sense

01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:47.420
why you break? why you break on me?

01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:49.420

okay there must be something that I'm doing wrong

01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:11.420
let's try this again

01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:13.420
let's try this again

01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:15.420
one last time

01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:18.420
hmm

01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:21.420
should be possible we need a mother or G sun

01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:23.420
yeah we do

01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:26.420
mother or G sun where are you?

01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:29.420
what the fuck

01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:33.420
okay I mean

01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:36.420
what was the point of that?

01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:38.420
hello?

01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:40.420
what's up there?

01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:43.420
um okay

01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:46.420
that seems like it was really pointless

01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:48.420
can I

01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:52.420
fuck

01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:54.420
oh my eye

01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:02.420
why does it keep doing that though? I don't understand that

01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:07.420
can I jump over here?

01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:11.420
this looks like really really grab a ball right?

01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:13.420
like it's not just me

01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:16.420
it looks very like something you can grab

01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:21.420
man my nose keeps being itchy

01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:22.420

01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:24.420
oh can I do this?

01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:25.420
okay

01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:29.420
okay I have no idea what was the point of the other one

01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:32.420
it literally didn't do anything

01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:34.420
okay let's go

01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:37.420
spider bear

01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:39.420
spider bear

01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:41.420
spider bear

01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:46.420

01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:48.420
okay I need to be fast

01:41:48.420 --> 01:41:50.420
I need to be fast

01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:52.420
fast and furious

01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:54.420
let's go

01:41:56.420 --> 01:41:58.420
come on

01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:00.420
come on

01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:03.420
come on

01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:08.420
me just standing up with like zero expression

01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:10.420
just frozen

01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:16.420
yes it is

01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:19.420
I don't need the binoculars

01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:21.420
it doesn't help okay

01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:29.420
okay let's see what do we need to do here

01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:31.420
I see a lot of balls here

01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:34.420
so we need to do something with the balls I assume

01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:39.420
come on G sons I know there's enough balls of you to put in here

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:42.420
so help me fix the puzzle

01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:44.420
ooh shiny

01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:46.420
look at this pretty light

01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:50.420
that looks so cool look

01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:53.420
oh my god it looks like I'm in the rave

01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:56.420
look it looks like I could DJ here

01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:58.420
imagine if I DJ'd in here

01:42:58.420 --> 01:43:00.420
in these lights that would be so pretty

01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:02.420
look

01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:05.420
now I just need like a DJ booth over here

01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:08.420
and I could DJ that would be so cool

01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:13.420
okay

01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:16.420
there's a ball here

01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:22.420
how do I get it though

01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:26.420
okay I'll worry about that later

01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:29.420
maybe I go up first

01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:32.420
and figure it out from there

01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:38.420
I can't jump here

01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:43.420
where can I jump then

01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:45.420
oh fuck

01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:47.420
oh no

01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:51.420
do I need to put the balls somewhere else maybe

01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:55.420
hmm

01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:05.420
oh no I don't know where to go

01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:08.420
hmm

01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:12.420
let's see if it makes any difference if I take the ball somewhere

01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:15.420
somewhere else

01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:20.420

here for me to do

01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:12.420
I'm wondering

01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:15.420
I don't think so

01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:18.420
I'm thinking for me to do here

01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:21.420
look

01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:24.420

okay and now it opens up

01:49:56.420 --> 01:49:59.420
this one so

01:49:59.420 --> 01:50:02.420
maybe there's a way to get to that one

01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:05.420
come on

01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:12.420
too proud of that of course I'm proud of that

01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:15.420
that was a genius idea

01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:21.420
okay let's see

01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:40.420
I don't see a ball over there though

01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:45.420
is there supposed to be one

01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:48.420
because I don't see it

01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:51.420
I don't see more balls

01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:55.420

I need the third ball

01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:06.420
but I don't know how to get it

01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:09.420
fuck what is this view

01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:12.420
can I

01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:15.420
no

01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:18.420
I keep losing so much health

01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:21.420
and I'm out of all of my medkits as well

01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:27.420

01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:36.420
how do I

01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:39.420
how do I get up there

01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:42.420
how do I get the third ball

01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:45.420
how do I get the third ball

01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:48.420
I need the third ball

01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:51.420
you don't understand it's not a want

01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:54.420
it's a need

01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:57.420
okay

01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:02.420
that binoculars doesn't help at all

01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:06.420
it's the dumbest system they have in this game

01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:09.420
it's like

01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:12.420
if he is like the binoculars in this game

01:52:12.420 --> 01:52:15.420
when you're lost and stuff like that

01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:17.420
it just goes

01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:20.420
oh this is a

01:52:20.420 --> 01:52:23.420
blah blah blah

01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:26.420
this is a blah blah blah

01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:29.420
yeah it just says what it is

01:52:29.420 --> 01:52:32.420
it doesn't say what to do with it

01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:35.420
maybe move the other balls

01:52:35.420 --> 01:52:38.420
to other buttons

01:52:38.420 --> 01:52:41.420
maybe

01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:50.420
okay maybe let's try to move this one

01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:53.420
over here

01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:56.420
no I have rocks falling on me

01:52:56.420 --> 01:52:59.420
okay this one is still

01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:02.420
will this help me

01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:09.420
okay I don't think I really did anything

01:53:10.420 --> 01:53:13.420
I don't think that really helped

01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:23.420
come on why is my thing not working

01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:26.420

01:53:57.420 --> 01:54:00.420
like 30 minutes ago probably

01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:03.420

01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:06.420
I'm so stupid I just didn't press the right button

01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:09.420
I was like oh why doesn't my grapple work

01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:12.420

01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:15.420

01:55:24.420 --> 01:55:27.420

01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:33.420
that you will have to figure out on your own

01:55:37.420 --> 01:55:40.420
very big brain but smooth

01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:43.420
