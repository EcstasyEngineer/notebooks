You

05:28.680 --> 05:30.680
You

05:58.680 --> 06:00.680
You

06:28.680 --> 06:30.680
You

06:52.680 --> 06:56.680
Hello my sweet snowberries. Hi.

06:56.680 --> 07:00.680
Hello. Hello.

07:08.680 --> 07:14.680
I hope that you are doing well today.

07:16.680 --> 07:22.680
I have a bit of problems with my throat.

07:22.680 --> 07:44.680
So if I don't speak as much as I usually do during my ASMR streams, that's why then on top of that I also have a migraine as well.

07:44.680 --> 07:54.680
I take some painkillers before the stream but they still didn't kick in yet.

07:54.680 --> 08:04.680
So sorry in advance if I'm not at my best performance today.

08:04.680 --> 08:08.680
I hope you can understand.

08:14.680 --> 08:26.680
Feel free to end stream really if it's too much. Yeah I will but for now I'm completely okay.

08:26.680 --> 08:32.680
I miss you a lot and I really want to spend some time together.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.680
Thank you.

09:14.680 --> 09:38.680
So yesterday, as some of you know, I kind of had a day for disconnecting from you.

09:38.680 --> 09:48.680
From what I do and from breathing anything and from social media etc.

09:48.680 --> 09:54.680
And I'll be honest, it was so fucking difficult.

09:54.680 --> 09:58.680
It was like really really difficult.

09:58.680 --> 10:06.680
I legitimately felt like a physical feeling in my chest.

10:06.680 --> 10:22.680
My chest felt really tight the whole day because I kept wanting to read everything and respond to things and all of that.

10:22.680 --> 10:30.680
So it was really more difficult than I thought it would be.

10:30.680 --> 10:44.680
And that's kind of scary because it literally felt like how people describe it when you're addicted to something.

10:44.680 --> 10:56.680
And then you try to stop doing it and you just have the strongest urges to do it.

10:56.680 --> 11:08.680
And you have to basically restrain yourself and it takes so much control and effort to do that.

11:08.680 --> 11:16.680
With that being said, I don't think you realized actually what happened yesterday.

11:16.680 --> 11:20.680
Yes, I did disconnect from everything.

11:20.680 --> 11:34.680
However, I actually ended up not going outside because I was so sleepy and tired

11:34.680 --> 11:40.680
that I ended up just like sleeping pretty much the whole day.

11:40.680 --> 11:44.680
So basically what happened is I woke up.

11:44.680 --> 11:54.680
I was awake for like a little bit, got sleepy, went back to sleep, woke up again.

11:54.680 --> 12:04.680
I had lunch, watched some videos, felt sleepy again, went back to sleep again until like 6pm.

12:04.680 --> 12:08.680
Like no joke, I woke up at like 6pm.

12:08.680 --> 12:14.680
I was so sleepy, like really really sleepy.

12:14.680 --> 12:20.680
And so when I woke up at like 6pm I was like fuck, I'm so tired.

12:20.680 --> 12:28.680
Like I really really don't want to go anywhere.

12:28.680 --> 12:36.680
So I just, yeah, yesterday was just me just sleeping pretty much.

12:36.680 --> 12:42.680
I didn't go outside.

12:42.680 --> 12:54.680
But I actually did go outside today because I still wanted to go outside like I promised myself.

12:54.680 --> 13:04.680
So I did go outside and I just walked around and just breathed some nice fresh air.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.680
The weather was really nice.

13:06.680 --> 13:12.680
It was like warm but not overbearing, you know.

13:12.680 --> 13:16.680
There was like a nice wind.

13:16.680 --> 13:24.680
And actually in the middle of it it started raining really hard, like out of nowhere.

13:24.680 --> 13:32.680
And everyone was like surprised because on the weather forecast it was not supposed to rain today.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.680
But it did.

13:34.680 --> 13:40.680
But it was really refreshing because I could smell, you know, that good scent of the rain.

13:40.680 --> 13:50.680
So it was like, but fresh rain, scent.

13:50.680 --> 13:58.680
It was extremely nice and refreshing.

13:58.680 --> 14:20.680
And then I went to a store just to see if there's anything I need or if there's any like stuff that I could like maybe use for ASMR triggers.

14:20.680 --> 14:33.680
And it's pretty crazy but when I was there, there was a song that started playing.

14:33.680 --> 14:45.680
And the beginning of that song sounded a lot like fade into you, the song that I was singing at the karaoke.

14:45.680 --> 14:55.680
So when I heard like the first few seconds of the melody, like I instantly like thought about, you know, the karaoke night we had.

14:55.680 --> 15:00.680
And my heart like skipped a beat, you know.

15:00.680 --> 15:09.680
And then, and not after that, they played Braining Man.

15:09.680 --> 15:13.680
Like I'm not fucking kidding, they played Braining Man.

15:13.680 --> 15:19.680
And I was like, no fucking way, no fucking way.

15:19.680 --> 15:31.680
I thought it was really crazy because you know, I go outside to disconnect from you, right?

15:31.680 --> 15:34.680
And not think about any of this.

15:34.680 --> 15:42.680
But then even when I go outside, you know, to distract myself, there's things that remind me of you.

15:42.680 --> 15:52.680
Like the songs from the karaoke that started playing and like instantly like my brain went, what the fuck?

15:52.680 --> 15:57.680
Like no, no, no way that happened.

15:57.680 --> 16:08.680
And I instantly, you know, smiled and remembered how amazing the karaoke was and how much fun I had.

16:12.680 --> 16:36.680
I also ordered some food to get home with me.

16:36.680 --> 16:53.680
It was like this really, really good like dish salad that had like grilled vegetables and some lettuce and like small baby potatoes.

16:53.680 --> 16:57.680
It was so freaking good, holy fuck.

16:57.680 --> 17:03.680
Like I didn't not expect it to taste that good, but it was really, really fucking good.

17:03.680 --> 17:19.680
I think I think it had like red peppers in it, eggplant, some lettuce and some, I don't know what else was there.

17:19.680 --> 17:29.680
There were more stuff, but I don't remember the name of it, but anyways, it tasted really, really, really good as the point.

17:29.680 --> 17:36.680
So I was really happy that I got that.

17:36.680 --> 17:48.680
So when I was at the store, I bought like this lollipop chupa chups.

17:48.680 --> 17:51.680
This is a lollipop candy.

17:51.680 --> 18:05.680
I bought it because when I was a kid, I remember I used to really love these and I haven't had it since then, pretty much.

18:05.680 --> 18:17.680
So I thought I could buy it and maybe I'll use it too for some of my smart triggers, possibly.

18:22.680 --> 18:25.680
The flavor is strawberry.

18:25.680 --> 18:54.680
And then I bought like this squishy stress toy, I guess.

18:54.680 --> 19:01.680
It's very like bright pink, and it has like a really stupid and silly face.

19:01.680 --> 19:13.680
And I thought maybe I could use it as an ASMR trigger, but to be fair, I don't know how good of a sound it makes.

19:24.680 --> 19:39.680
It actually sounds pretty nice.

19:39.680 --> 19:48.680
I'm glad to hear that, because the thing is, it was inside like a packaging.

19:48.680 --> 20:06.680
So it was hard for me to figure out exactly what it's going to sound like outside of it, but it's a squishy toy, so I thought maybe it would make good sounds.

20:06.680 --> 20:11.680
I also have bubble wrap.

20:11.680 --> 20:27.680
I remember that someone has requested bubble wrap as an ASMR trigger, so today's your lucky day, because they have some bubble wrap.

20:36.680 --> 20:50.680
The bubble wrap makes really, really good sounds, really tingly ones, I think.

20:50.680 --> 20:56.680
So I have a feeling most of you would probably enjoy it.

20:57.680 --> 21:04.680
Okay, let me bring the bubble wrap.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.680
I can't wait to talk.

21:26.680 --> 21:55.680
Right, it sounds so good, doesn't it?

21:55.680 --> 22:24.680
I think bubble wrap makes really good sounds.

22:24.680 --> 22:28.680
I think a decent bubble wrap makes a lot of sounds.

22:55.680 --> 23:07.680
I'm kicking and thinking of forgetting a text from why is he saying this song remind me of you and the speaker explodes with a training man.

23:07.680 --> 23:10.680
Thank you.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.680
Super.

23:26.680 --> 23:30.680
Packaging my tea sands up to ship them to your address.

23:30.680 --> 23:32.680
Okay, real.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.680
Thank you.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.680
I'm here.

23:41.680 --> 23:51.680
That's why I need to wrap you in bubble wrap so I can be shipped to your address.

24:02.680 --> 24:05.680
Okay.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.680
Okay.

25:02.680 --> 25:05.680
Okay.

25:32.680 --> 25:35.680
Okay.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.680
Okay.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.680
Okay.

26:50.680 --> 26:54.680
I love pulling you together like a ship.

27:02.680 --> 27:05.680
Okay.

27:33.680 --> 27:35.680
Okay.

27:53.680 --> 27:55.680
I love you.

27:56.680 --> 27:58.680
Okay.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.680
I love you.

28:14.680 --> 28:16.680
Touch.

28:25.680 --> 28:27.680
Okay.

28:55.680 --> 28:58.680
Okay.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.680
I hope it's okay with you.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.680
It'll be right back.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.680
Okay, I need to.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.680
I need to be super super fat.

29:35.680 --> 29:36.680
I'll be right back.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.680
I'll be right back.

29:38.680 --> 29:39.680
Okay.

29:39.680 --> 29:40.680
Okay.

29:40.680 --> 29:41.680
I love you.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.680
I love you.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.680
Take it.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.680
Okay.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.680
Okay.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.680
Okay.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.680
Okay.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.680
Okay.

32:08.680 --> 32:16.680
So I see how if you're playing the game again, huh?

32:17.680 --> 32:25.680
I'm actually wearing black panties today.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.680
And thank you for all the welcome back.

32:46.680 --> 32:48.680
Okay.

33:16.680 --> 33:18.680
Okay.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.680
Okay.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.680
Okay.

33:55.680 --> 33:57.680
Okay.

34:04.680 --> 34:06.680
Okay.

34:06.680 --> 34:08.680
Okay.

34:12.680 --> 34:14.680
Okay.

34:16.680 --> 34:18.680
Okay.

34:47.680 --> 34:49.680
Okay.

34:55.680 --> 34:57.680
Okay.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.680
Okay.

35:12.680 --> 35:14.680
Okay.

35:46.680 --> 36:13.740
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.

36:13.740 --> 36:15.740
I love you

36:43.740 --> 36:45.740
I love you

37:14.740 --> 37:19.740
I love you

37:20.740 --> 37:23.740
I love you

37:44.740 --> 37:46.740
I love you

37:49.740 --> 37:51.740
I love you

37:51.740 --> 37:53.740
I love you

37:53.740 --> 37:55.740
I love you

37:55.740 --> 37:57.740
I love you

37:57.740 --> 37:59.740
I love you

37:59.740 --> 38:01.740
I love you

38:01.740 --> 38:03.740
I love you

38:07.740 --> 38:09.740
I love you

38:09.740 --> 38:11.740
I love you

38:12.740 --> 38:14.740
I love you

38:22.740 --> 38:27.740
Scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch.

38:27.740 --> 38:34.740
Scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch.

38:37.740 --> 38:40.740
Scratch, scratch.

38:41.740 --> 38:51.740
ca-chis-chis, ca-chis-chis

38:51.740 --> 39:06.740
ca-chis-chis, ca-chis-chis, ca-chis-chis

39:06.740 --> 39:09.740
Plus six

39:09.740 --> 39:10.740

39:10.740 --> 39:11.740

39:11.740 --> 39:12.740
a-side-but-load

39:12.740 --> 39:14.740
outside

39:44.740 --> 40:13.240
oh my god, I can't... I can't find the juice... I can't find the juice

40:14.740 --> 40:22.740
somber, thank you so much for joining funpush it, I love

40:44.740 --> 40:46.740
you

41:14.740 --> 41:41.740
how do you come up with these triggers?

41:42.740 --> 41:50.740
I just look around the house and see if there's anything I can make good sounds with

41:50.740 --> 41:54.740
that's pretty much all it is

42:20.740 --> 42:38.740
make good choices, this is super comfy, yay, thank you

42:38.740 --> 43:04.740
I try my best to find the triggers every time there's an ASMR stream

43:04.740 --> 43:12.740
can we get something in Russian too? depends, like what?

43:35.740 --> 43:42.740
I would say that, but my parents hooked my thoughts

43:42.740 --> 43:52.740
so how about I say that in the member stream? would that be okay?

43:52.740 --> 44:04.740
I could say that in a member stream tomorrow, but I can still say I love you in Russian

44:23.740 --> 44:25.740
I love you

44:30.740 --> 44:33.740
I love you

44:35.740 --> 44:38.740
very much

44:39.740 --> 44:53.740
what do you mean discovered? they know

44:53.740 --> 45:02.740
what do you mean oof? they support me, they're very sweet about it

45:08.740 --> 45:37.740
so they approve of your misters, I mean I think they would prefer if I have one mister

45:37.740 --> 45:39.740
but

45:46.740 --> 45:51.740
hello Kevin, thank you for the membership, welcome

45:51.740 --> 46:07.740
I can't, you always make me laugh, you're so funny

46:07.740 --> 46:27.740
for 100 people turning up to your brand's house to ask permission to marry you

46:28.740 --> 46:37.740
imagine, oh my god, my dad would be like, what the fuck, who are these people?

46:42.740 --> 46:48.740
fucking kicks you down the fucking stairs, punches you

46:57.740 --> 47:06.740
oh my god, now we'd win

47:06.740 --> 47:21.740
my dad is super nice, he's really sweet, he's not much of a talker and he looks very serious but he's a good person

47:27.740 --> 47:38.740
it's good to be an interesting family for you

47:38.740 --> 47:50.740
I don't think that would be enough space for all of you to be honest, they live like in a really really small apartment

47:58.740 --> 48:04.740
basement, they don't have a basement

48:04.740 --> 48:23.740
can I just hang out on the porch with Bob up here while the other guy sits right there

48:23.740 --> 48:31.740
I mean, I suppose if you get to talk to him then maybe your chance is higher

48:31.740 --> 48:38.740
than if you spend it fighting with others

48:38.740 --> 48:48.740
like if you drink a beer with him or something like that then he would enjoy that

49:01.740 --> 49:27.740
I don't drink though, well, if you don't drink, I don't know how you're gonna bond with my dad to be honest

49:31.740 --> 49:38.740
oh my god, pure and fraught, I fucking can't

49:38.740 --> 49:43.740
rogue Robin, thank you so much for the membership, welcome in

49:43.740 --> 49:46.740
can I live in the fridge?

49:46.740 --> 49:48.740
no

49:49.740 --> 49:56.740
I can take him to dinner and go fishing

49:56.740 --> 50:05.740
fishing, he would love the heck out of that, my dad actually loves fishing

50:05.740 --> 50:11.740
sometimes he goes on the weekends fishing with his friends

50:11.740 --> 50:17.740
and then he comes back home and cooks the fish that he got for my mom

50:17.740 --> 50:24.740
and it always makes her extremely happy, I think it's super sweet

50:41.740 --> 50:47.740
ah

51:11.740 --> 51:21.740
the real question is if Papa Bear is single, what the fuck, no

51:21.740 --> 51:29.740
my parents are married for like 25 years, they are very much happily married

51:29.740 --> 51:37.740
they're definitely not single, happily married for 25 years

51:59.740 --> 52:15.740
no, there's no chance, shut up, I love my parents' relationship and their marriage

52:16.740 --> 52:31.740
they're the only reason that I have hope that marriages can work and that you can be married for so long

52:31.740 --> 52:39.740
and still show affection to each other and still do nice gestures for each other

52:39.740 --> 52:47.740
you know, not to have this basically dead relationship just because you're married

52:47.740 --> 52:58.740
so they're literally the reason that I still believe that it's possible to have a really good and healthy marriage

52:59.740 --> 53:14.740
like, whenever it's her anniversary or her birthday, my dad always buys her either jewelry or some flowers and stuff like that

53:14.740 --> 53:23.740
and you know, when he goes fishing, he really likes to cook the fish that he gets for her

53:23.740 --> 53:31.740
and they love traveling as well, which is another thing that I think is super cute

53:31.740 --> 53:44.740
at least once a year they go travel somewhere around the world and you know, enjoy their life to the best together and make memories

53:44.740 --> 54:02.740
so, yeah, I really love the relationship that my parents have and they would be like the perfect example for, you know, a good, healthy and loving marriage

54:03.740 --> 54:09.740
do they always travel together?

54:09.740 --> 54:12.740
do they always travel together?

54:12.740 --> 54:14.740
yes, always

54:14.740 --> 54:16.740
yes, always

54:16.740 --> 54:33.740
like, a couple of months ago, it was my dad's birthday

54:34.740 --> 54:42.740
and my mom basically planned a trip to Austria with him

54:42.740 --> 54:53.740
and I actually took a train to Austria so that I could see my dad and celebrate his birthday together with him

54:54.740 --> 54:56.740
so, yeah

54:57.740 --> 55:00.740
I love their relationship

55:00.740 --> 55:02.740
their relationship

55:03.740 --> 55:05.740
and I love them in general

55:05.740 --> 55:17.740
they have always been very sweet and supportive of me, always loving and I really can't say enough good things about my mom and dad

55:17.740 --> 55:20.740
both very amazing people

55:24.740 --> 55:27.740
and my grandparents

55:29.740 --> 55:36.740
my grandparents have been married for like 60 years

55:37.740 --> 55:42.740
would have been longer if he didn't pass away

55:44.740 --> 55:48.740
but basically they had like, you know, a really good relationship as well

55:48.740 --> 55:54.740
and the way that they met is actually a crazy story

55:54.740 --> 56:05.740
if you want, I'll tell you like, the crazy story about my grandma and grandpa got together

56:05.740 --> 56:12.740
when my mom told me the story, it was like, holy shit, that's crazy

56:18.740 --> 56:29.740
so basically, so back story, my grandpa was actually already engaged

56:29.740 --> 56:35.740
and he was actually supposed to have a wedding and marry someone

56:37.740 --> 56:43.740
and just one day, when he was at the train station

56:44.740 --> 56:51.740
my grandma just casually walked out of that train

56:51.740 --> 56:59.740
and he saw her and he just like, you know, like instantly knew that she's the one

56:59.740 --> 57:03.740
like, he saw her and he knew that she's the one

57:04.740 --> 57:09.740
and he ended up cancelling the wedding

57:10.740 --> 57:16.740
and, you know, tried to get my grandma's attention

57:16.740 --> 57:20.740
and, you know, get her and he did

57:20.740 --> 57:25.740
and they've had a really amazing relationship

57:25.740 --> 57:30.740
and they have been married for 60 years

57:30.740 --> 57:34.740
freaking 60 years, you know

57:34.740 --> 57:46.740
so, yeah, it's like, sometimes, sometimes, like, he just knew, you know, like, he saw her

57:46.740 --> 57:53.740
and he instantly knew that, yes, this is my person, you know, this is the person that

57:53.740 --> 57:59.740
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with and he just did everything he could

58:00.740 --> 58:03.740
to, you know, get together with her

58:03.740 --> 58:10.740
and they ended up getting married and being married for 60 years

58:10.740 --> 58:19.740
so, yeah, that's the story of how my grandparents got together

58:29.740 --> 58:31.740
so

58:49.740 --> 58:53.740
you're not a feminist, you're just

59:45.740 --> 59:48.740
I fucking can't, but there will be no kids

59:48.740 --> 59:50.740
no kids, because I don't want kids

59:51.740 --> 59:53.740
I am the kid
