507460	537420	I was gonna talk a bit and stuff, and like, thank the people who donated as well, and I was like, I feel, and I don't know why the fuck, but I accidentally clicked like the exit thing, and my OBS fucking closed, and I was like, fuck, how did that even happen, so yeah, I do, I do apologize, I do apologize,
537460	564460	for that, because that was not the plan, I did want to like chat a bit, you know, but yeah, so that happened, yesterday's stream was wild, but like in the best way possible, like, I was so fucking happy, and I was having so much fun, but I did feel like so brain dead like the entire time,
564460	591460	like, it felt like a fever dream, it felt like really surreal, it felt like I was on a trip or something, to be honest, like, it was really something, but it was so much fun, like, I couldn't stop laughing, I just enjoyed being my unhinged self, and just being silly, and hanging out with the girls,
591460	619460	and us being all silly, and having fun together, because like, because I missed doing that kind of stuff, because you know, before the debut, you know, we didn't stream, right, so we had a lot more time to like hang out together, or stuff like that, but you know, after the debut, we all have to like focus on establishing ourselves, and
622460	641460	and you know, have to stream, and always have like some other stuff that we always like need to do, so it's like, you know, it's more complicated to be in a situation where we can all like catch each other, if that makes sense, I don't know if that makes sense,
642460	651460	but yeah, so it was really nice to be able to do that again, I had a blast, it was really good,
651460	680460	it's good, you're seemingly all pretty good friends, yeah, they're all very, very sweet, and nice girls to be around, I feel very lucky to have them as my gen mates, you know, because when I initially joined, you know, there's always that fear of like, oh, you know, I wonder what the people, the other people will be like, when
681460	709460	they join, and if, you know, we'll get along, because like, you know, for me, I always wanted to be in like a corpus so that I can make friends with the girls in it, and so that we can grow closer and closer together, because we're all in this together, and we all, you know, try to reach our dreams together, and
709460	738460	and just, you know, like really build like a special friendship, thanks to that, and you know, it turned out to be like, it turned out to be like so amazing, you know, they're also sweet, also nice, all like so helpful when either one of us needs help, or something happens, or like looking out for each other, it's truly amazing, it makes me really happy, you know, it's amazing, I
739460	768460	like, I am, I really am living the dream, I really am, like my dream became truly a reality, I just feel so lucky to have such amazing gen mates, and I feel so incredibly lucky to have you in my community, because you're all just so amazing and kind and sweet to me, and that's crazy, you know, like I was not expecting
769460	797460	for things to turn out like this amazingly, or like this, like overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly positive, sorry, it's hard for me to say some words, overwhelmingly positive, you know, like I just, like, let me explain, like I did not know what my community is going to be like, right, like I did not know like how it's going to develop, or
799460	811460	how it's going to do happen, and then like it just, all of you turned out to be just so freaking amazing and so sweet, like, how does that happen?
812460	833460	Okay, okay, I actually, okay, this, I don't know if I should say that, but, I don't know if I should say that, but I wanted to make like a meme, I wanted to make like a meme of like two different pictures, and the first one says,
833460	863460	the first one says, me, how I felt about men, before Vealor, versus how I feel about men, after Vealor, because of you snowberries, because of you snowberries, so basically I was going to put like a picture on the first image, where I just looked pissed off at the first picture, and I was like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't
863460	880300	know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, so
880300	883800	Wow, some men really are amazing, huh?
883800	888800	Some men really are really, really sweet and nice.
888800	892300	Maybe not all men are trash after all.
892300	896300	Some are really, really sweet.
896300	901300	But yeah, so thank you for that.
901300	908300	Thank you for being so amazing that you were able to change my mind.
911300	915300	You can call me trash if you want.
915300	919300	I don't know about that. I don't know. I would feel really bad.
919300	922300	Because you're all so sweet.
926300	931300	You know, I see the reasons reflect what I see shows to us.
931300	936300	You're so sweet, I see. No. You're so sweet.
936300	939300	I genuinely mean it, though.
939300	946300	After talking to all of you and seeing how kind you are
946300	952300	and caring and sweet towards me, I was like, damn.
952300	959300	Okay, so maybe not all men are trash after all.
959300	967300	Some men really can be sweet and nice and kind, you know?
967300	974300	And it's nice. I don't know how to word it.
974300	978300	But basically what I'm trying to say is that I love you
978300	983300	and you're so amazing that you made me change my mind.
984300	988300	So I hope that makes sense.
991300	994300	You give up great vibes.
994300	996300	I can tell you're not a sweet kind of person.
996300	999300	Oh, thank you. Thank you. I try to be.
999300	1005300	But I can be a bitch sometimes, I think.
1005300	1007300	I don't know.
1007300	1009300	Okay, so you know how you say that?
1009300	1013300	You think that I'm like a sweet person and stuff?
1013300	1016300	I don't know why, but whenever people tell me
1016300	1019300	that they think I'm very sweet or nice, it kind of scares me.
1019300	1021300	Not like scares me.
1021300	1025300	Okay, scares is a strong word.
1025300	1027300	It's a strong word.
1027300	1030300	I don't know if that's the word I would use.
1031300	1033300	It's more like...
1033300	1037300	I think it's like when people worry,
1037300	1040300	maybe worry is a better word.
1040300	1041300	Yeah, maybe.
1041300	1045300	So sometimes it worries me or scares me
1045300	1047300	because I am like...
1049300	1051300	How do I word this?
1053300	1055300	Like I know what I want to say,
1055300	1058300	but I don't know how to word it or explain it
1058300	1060300	in a way that makes sense.
1060300	1062300	Basically, when people call me very nice
1062300	1064300	or super nice or super sweet,
1064300	1066300	my brain is like...
1066300	1067300	My brain is like,
1067300	1069300	no, I don't want you to think that
1069300	1073300	because every person has their moments.
1073300	1076300	Every person is going to have their bad days
1076300	1081300	or days when they're not all that sweet,
1081300	1086300	or they get angry or they get mean
1086300	1087300	or like...
1087300	1088300	I don't know.
1088300	1090300	Do you know what I'm trying to...
1090300	1092300	I don't know if it makes sense
1092300	1094300	what I'm trying to explain.
1094300	1096300	I hope it does.
1096300	1100300	But I don't know if it makes any sense.
1100300	1102300	You don't want to disappoint them
1102300	1104300	if they think you're always nice.
1104300	1107300	Maybe that's part of it.
1107300	1110300	But I also like...
1110300	1114300	I guess I don't want people to have the expectations
1114300	1117300	or think that I'm perfect
1117300	1120300	because no one is perfect.
1120300	1123300	Everyone deals with their shit.
1123300	1126300	Everyone has their...
1126300	1131300	not so great sides and stuff like that.
1131300	1135300	But what's important is that...
1135300	1138300	What's important is that the good stuff
1138300	1140300	overwhelm the bad, basically.
1141300	1143300	Basically that there's more good than bad
1143300	1146300	or that the good is stronger than the bad.
1146300	1148300	I don't know if that makes sense.
1148300	1150300	Doesn't make sense.
1150300	1152300	Outweight, maybe?
1152300	1154300	Overpower, maybe?
1154300	1157300	Do you see what I'm trying to explain?
1157300	1160300	I feel like I'm maybe like a mother.
1160300	1162300	I don't know.
1162300	1164300	I don't know.
1164300	1165300	I don't know.
1165300	1166300	I don't know.
1166300	1167300	I don't know.
1167300	1168300	I don't know.
1169300	1171300	I feel like I'm maybe like a...
1171300	1174300	I have trouble wording stuff
1174300	1176300	that I want to say sometimes.
1176300	1178300	Makes sense, yes.
1178300	1179300	Doesn't?
1179300	1181300	Okay, that's good.
1181300	1184300	I'm glad to hear that.
1184300	1187300	Because basically that's what I'm trying to say.
1187300	1189300	You...
1189300	1192300	We all have our different sides
1192300	1195300	and different parts of us
1195300	1196300	that aren't so great.
1196300	1198300	I do too, you know?
1198300	1200300	I do too, you know?
1200300	1204300	Even if you see me
1204300	1208300	only the sweet sides of me all the time
1208300	1210300	or all the good parts of me,
1210300	1212300	that doesn't mean that...
1212300	1215300	I don't have those bad parts either,
1215300	1218300	because I do and everyone does.
1218300	1220300	But when it comes to love,
1220300	1225300	it's about loving the person
1225300	1228300	despite the bad stuff
1228300	1233300	and that the good overpowers
1233300	1236300	any of those other stuff
1236300	1237300	that might be bad
1237300	1240300	or not ideal, I guess.
1240300	1241300	You know?
1243300	1246300	Sorry for the big yap.
1246300	1248300	I'm sorry for the big yap.
1248300	1253300	I feel like I'm being too serious or something.
1253300	1255300	I'm sorry for being weird
1255300	1258300	or too serious and stuff.
1258300	1261300	I hope I'm explaining myself well
1261300	1265300	because sometimes I'm scared that I don't...
1265300	1269300	that I don't make sense.
1269300	1272300	It's from the heart, so it's okay.
1272300	1274300	Are you sure?
1274300	1276300	Are you sure?
1276300	1280300	I get so nervous that I'm being too much
1280300	1283300	or the stuff that I say are...
1283300	1285300	I don't know.
1285300	1287300	I'm overthinking it as always.
1287300	1289300	I overthink stuff a lot.
1289300	1291300	If you couldn't tell by now,
1291300	1295300	I overthink a lot and get paranoid sometimes
1295300	1298300	and just worry a lot.
1298300	1302300	I just want to do my very best
1302300	1304300	at the end of the day.
1305300	1309300	We will love, bitch.
1309300	1312300	I see too. Don't worry.
1315300	1316300	Thank you.
1316300	1318300	I'm glad that you will still love me
1318300	1321300	even when I'm being a bitch.
1324300	1326300	Your best is more than enough.
1326300	1327300	Thank you.
1327300	1329300	That means a lot to me.
1330300	1332300	Thank you so much.
1332300	1334300	I can get that way too.
1334300	1337300	You're not going to be so hard on yourself.
1337300	1340300	I'll try.
1340300	1344300	Time to brush up on the bread taming skills.
1344300	1347300	I mean, you pretty much tamed me.
1347300	1349300	I mean, let's be real.
1349300	1352300	You pretty much tamed me.
1352300	1356300	And it took just a few days.
1356300	1359300	If you haven't done that, so...
1359300	1361300	That's so fucking embarrassing.
1361300	1363300	I still can get over it. I hate it.
1363300	1365300	What the fuck?
1365300	1367300	What the fuck?
1367300	1369300	Why are you just doing it?
1371300	1374300	Although I just still like to be a bread
1374300	1377300	every now and then.
1377300	1380300	I still like to do that stuff.
1380300	1384300	But I'm a sweet bread.
1384300	1388300	I think I would consider myself a sweet bread.
1391300	1393300	I don't know if that even makes sense,
1393300	1396300	but that's the best way that I can think of it.
1403300	1406300	You can just love me so much that bread is really fun.
1406300	1408300	Aw, thank you.
1408300	1410300	I love you too.
1412300	1414300	You are just too cute.
1414300	1415300	Thank you.
1415300	1417300	I'm really glad you think so.
1417300	1420300	I'm really glad to hear that.
1420300	1422300	I don't know, reading all of your kind words always
1422300	1425300	makes me just so happy, truly.
1427300	1429300	The bread is so cute.
1429300	1432300	Mr. may pretend to be irritated,
1432300	1435300	but it's just too flustered to admit he's happy.
1435300	1437300	Aw, that's really sweet.
1437300	1440300	To be honest though, to be honest though,
1440300	1444300	if I genuinely thought that you're like genuinely irritated with me,
1444300	1446300	I'm not gonna lie.
1446300	1448300	I would probably fucking cry.
1448300	1450300	I would be like fuck.
1450300	1452300	He fucking hates me.
1452300	1454300	It's so fucking over.
1454300	1457300	I'm gonna go KMS.
1457300	1460300	He doesn't love me anymore.
1463300	1466300	My brain just gets really fucking dramatic
1466300	1469300	because I overthink stuff.
1469300	1474300	You know, like, I don't know if I should even say that,
1474300	1477300	but I mean fuck it, fuck it.
1477300	1480300	Like, I'm the type of person that like, you know,
1480300	1484300	that like, if I don't get like a response for a while
1484300	1486300	and stuff like that,
1486300	1488300	or if I talk about something
1488300	1491300	and you don't touch like base on it,
1491300	1493300	even if you like just forgot to or something,
1493300	1496300	my brain instantly ghost you.
1496300	1499300	Oh no, they don't like me as much anymore.
1499300	1502300	Oh no, they're falling out of love.
1503300	1506300	Oh no, no, it's so over.
1508300	1510300	No, they don't care about what I said.
1510300	1513300	That's why they didn't respond to it.
1515300	1519300	That's literally me and it's like...
1520300	1522300	It's...
1522300	1524300	It's something.
1524300	1527300	But yeah.
1530300	1533300	I have a problem.
1534300	1537300	I have a problem.
1540300	1542300	I relate so hard.
1542300	1544300	I see everything can worry so hard.
1544300	1546300	Yeah, I'm glad it's not just me.
1546300	1548300	I'm glad it's not just me though.
1549300	1552300	It's good to know that because like, you know,
1552300	1556300	it's so easy to get worried about stuff like that.
1556300	1559300	You know, like...
1560300	1563300	It's just...
1563300	1565300	I don't know.
1566300	1568300	It's overwhelming, I guess.
1568300	1570300	And when you're an over-thinker,
1570300	1573300	and you're like me, then like,
1573300	1577300	it gets like, you know, brain-worms and stuff and...
1579300	1580300	But I try like...
1580300	1583300	I really try my best though to like,
1583300	1584300	not to think that way.
1584300	1587300	Like, anytime that I get worried about stuff like that,
1587300	1592300	I try to force myself and tell myself that that's not the case.
1592300	1594300	And that, you know,
1595300	1598300	either you're busy,
1598300	1601300	or either you didn't see what I wrote,
1601300	1604300	or you forgot to talk about something,
1604300	1606300	or et cetera, et cetera,
1606300	1609300	or you will touch base on it later,
1609300	1611300	or you will respond.
1611300	1614300	Or like, you know, like I'm trying to like,
1615300	1617300	stop being like...
1617300	1620300	Like stop thinking worst-case scenario, I guess,
1620300	1625300	and learn to rewire my brain to think like,
1625300	1627300	best-case scenario.
1627300	1629300	Like, and not instantly like,
1629300	1632300	go to the bad extreme side of things.
1632300	1634300	And it's hard, and it's hard because,
1634300	1638300	you know, your brain is wired like a certain way
1638300	1640300	for a long time.
1640300	1642300	So once you try to rewire it,
1642300	1644300	like, you literally like, have to like,
1644300	1647300	literally just force yourself to think a certain way.
1647300	1649300	And only after you do it long enough,
1649300	1651300	it slowly starts like,
1654300	1656300	you know, getting better.
1657300	1660300	I see the secret is that we sometimes get that way too,
1660300	1662300	so no worries.
1662300	1665300	I'm glad to hear that in a way.
1665300	1668300	Like, I am not glad that you feel that way,
1668300	1670300	because I mean, let's be honest,
1670300	1672300	feeling like that is always shit.
1672300	1674300	Feeling like that is always bad, right?
1674300	1677300	Like, it's never a good feeling to feel like that.
1677300	1679300	But when I say I'm glad you feel that way,
1679300	1682300	I mean it as in, I'm glad that...
1682300	1684300	It's not just me who feels like that,
1684300	1685300	if that makes sense.
1685300	1687300	Like, I'm glad that like,
1687300	1690300	it's not just me who like,
1690300	1692300	you know, over things.
1693300	1695300	You aren't that crazy yet.
1695300	1698300	I mean, you don't know that.
1698300	1700300	What if I am?
1700300	1702300	You don't know me?
1702300	1704300	What if I am?
1707300	1709300	No, my crazy is contained.
1709300	1711300	I take medication.
1711300	1713300	I take meds.
1713300	1716300	My crazy is contained
1716300	1718300	as much as it can be anyways.
1718300	1720300	There's only so much meds can do.
1724300	1726300	There's only so much meds can do,
1726300	1729300	you know, they keep me as stable as I can be,
1729300	1731300	basically, so yeah.
1731300	1734300	So, shout out to my meds.
1736300	1740300	Me too, she's just like me for real, for real.
1743300	1744300	We don't want it contained.
1744300	1747300	Oh, trust me, it's...
1748300	1752300	It's really bad if I don't have my meds.
1752300	1755300	It's best for myself and everyone else,
1755300	1757300	but I do take my meds, to be honest.
1758300	1760300	Otherwise, my...
1762300	1764300	Yeah, so...
1767300	1768300	Wow, this is you on meds?
1768300	1770300	Yeah, this is me on meds.
1770300	1772300	I always do what's best for yourself.
1772300	1774300	Yeah, that's exactly it.
1776300	1778300	I'm glad that I have meds that work for me.
1778300	1781300	It took me like a few years to actually find
1781300	1783300	something that works properly for me.
1783300	1785300	I feel bad.
1785300	1787300	I feel like I'm trauma dumping on you right now.
1787300	1789300	Am I trauma dumping?
1789300	1791300	Fuck, I should just stop.
1791300	1792300	I feel so bad.
1792300	1794300	Am I trauma dumping right now?
1794300	1795300	I can't tell.
1795300	1798300	Like, I'm just trying to like talk with you
1798300	1801300	and, you know, get to know each other better
1801300	1803300	and get closer, I guess.
1803300	1805300	But I don't know if I'm trauma dumping.
1807300	1810300	Maybe I should just play the game and shut up.
1813300	1815300	No, you're not. It's fine, darling.
1816300	1819300	No, it's perfectly okay. I keep talking.
1820300	1822300	No, we're just bonding.
1822300	1823300	Okay, okay, okay.
1823300	1825300	I'm just making sure.
1825300	1826300	I'm just making sure.
1826300	1828300	Because when I talk about this stuff,
1828300	1831300	it's my way to bond with you, I guess.
1831300	1834300	Like, having you get to know me better, you know?
1838300	1840300	So, your anxiety is getting to you.
1840300	1842300	It's not trauma dumping.
1843300	1846300	Why would we consider trauma dumping, then?
1849300	1850300	Now I'm scared.
1850300	1851300	Now I'm scared.
1851300	1854300	What if I accidentally start trauma dumping, though?
1854300	1856300	That's so bad!
1859300	1860300	Oh, no!
1864300	1866300	I see this isn't trauma dumping.
1866300	1869300	Saying I take meds for health isn't dumping.
1870300	1872300	Yeah, who am I talking about, nearly?
1876300	1878300	It's an unhealthy term, honestly.
1878300	1880300	Usually sharing trauma with friends is helpful.
1880300	1882300	Okay, okay.
1882300	1884300	Okay, listen, I agree.
1884300	1886300	You know what? I agree.
1886300	1889300	Can I just say that I kind of agree?
1890300	1891300	Like...
1892300	1895300	Like, if you talk to your friends,
1895300	1897300	or people that are close to you,
1897300	1899300	and you tell them that stuff,
1899300	1901300	I don't think that's trauma dumping.
1902300	1903300	Like...
1904300	1905300	You know?
1905300	1908300	I feel like that's a way to bond with someone
1908300	1910300	and be there for them.
1910300	1912300	Like, yeah, if a random...
1912300	1915300	It's trauma dumping, if it's a random person
1915300	1918300	that I don't fucking know at all.
1919300	1923300	Just going outside, I'm sitting at a bench,
1923300	1924300	and...
1924300	1926300	Someone random sits next to me,
1926300	1930300	and they're like telling me their life trauma.
1930300	1931300	Like, you know?
1934300	1935300	You know?
1935300	1936300	Like, okay, like...
1937300	1938300	Yeah.
1938300	1941300	The term, like many others, is way to overuse these days.
1941300	1944300	People call any sort of emotional talk trauma dumping these days.
1944300	1945300	Okay, that's so true.
1945300	1947300	I completely agree.
1947300	1948300	Yeah, I completely agree with that.
1948300	1949300	That is so true.
1950300	1951300	I agree.
1951300	1955300	There's a lot of terms that are getting, like, overused,
1955300	1959300	and people, like, don't even know, like,
1959300	1961300	the real meaning behind them anymore.
1969300	1973300	We care about you, so we want to talk about this stuff.
1977300	1980300	Yeah, language gets weird, yeah.
1980300	1981300	I agree.
1982300	1987300	I feel like it gets weirder the more time goes.
1987300	1991300	Like, there's always, like, new terms popping up,
1991300	1993300	and I'm just, like, pro...
1994300	1999300	Can we just, like, talk normally like we used to years ago?
2002300	2005300	I'm okay with hearing you talk about anything.
2005300	2007300	Okay, that's good to know.
2008300	2010300	Heavy words being used too lightly.
2010300	2012300	Yeah, exactly!
2012300	2015300	Okay, literally that, though, like, using heavy words
2015300	2020300	and using them way too often and, like, too lightly.
2020300	2022300	Like, brah, you know?
2022300	2027300	Like, not every single fucking thing is trauma dumping, okay?
2029300	2032300	It took me too long to learn what risk was.
2032300	2034300	Okay, same, same!
2034300	2036300	That's, it's not just you, it's not just you.
2036300	2037300	Same.
2037300	2042300	After the longest time when I saw the word, like, risk going around,
2042300	2046300	I was like, what the fuck does that shit even mean?
2046300	2049300	What the fuck is risk?
2049300	2054300	Like, there's all this, like, fucking zoomer fucking terms,
2054300	2057300	and I'm just like, bro, what?
2057300	2061300	What the fuck is what?
2061300	2063300	I sit up to your risler.
2063300	2066300	I don't, I don't know, I don't know if I am.
2066300	2067300	I don't know if I am.
2067300	2070300	I don't know if you remember, but my experience with Rufus
2070300	2073300	in Rockstar Simulator wasn't very good.
2073300	2076300	I don't think I had much risk at all.
2079300	2081300	Oh my god.
2081300	2084300	Maybe I see what's the realer she said after all.
2084300	2087300	Fuck you, I'm not!

2092300	2094300	Just for, just, okay, listen.
2094300	2097300	Just for calling me that, just for calling me that.
2097300	2100300	I'm no longer gonna call you dadda.
2100300	2103300	I'm just gonna call you a bitch from now.
2103300	2108300	If you say that to me, you are not my dadda, okay?
2108300	2113300	If you call me that, you are no longer my daddy.

2156300	2159300	It's funny to me cause it's true.

2167300	2171300	Some people generally would say that to you.
2172300	2177300	Like some people like you're gonna like tell them like you're depressed or something.

2186300	2188300	What do you mean?

2441300	2443300	Okay, so now I have to say that all over again.
2443300	2445300	Oh my god, I hate this shit.
2445300	2449300	I was saying I'm so sorry for taking so long,
2449300	2451300	because I put in the charger
2451300	2453300	and it wasn't charging, so I was freaking out.
2453300	2455300	And as I was freaking out,
2455300	2457300	I accidentally like bruised my knee
2457300	2459300	because I hit it against something like a dumbass.
2459300	2461300	So ow.
2465300	2467300	Anyways,
2467300	2469300	that should be fine.
2469300	2471300	That shouldn't be a problem now.
2471300	2473300	It is charging now.
2473300	2475300	It is charging now.
2475300	2477300	I'm fine.
2479300	2481300	Time to kiss it better.
2481300	2483300	Yeah, kiss it better for me.
2483300	2485300	That would make me happy.
2487300	2489300	Kiss it better to make the bruise go away.
2489300	2491300	Kiss it better to make the bruise go away.
2495300	2497300	Please be careful.
2497300	2499300	I tried.
2499300	2501300	I'm okay though.
2501300	2503300	I'm just being a baby about it to be honest.
2503300	2505300	It's fine.
2509300	2511300	Thank you.
2511300	2513300	Thank you for all the kisses.
2517300	2519300	Or maybe add more bruises.
2519300	2521300	I mean,
2521300	2523300	that depends.
2523300	2525300	Only in certain situations.
2527300	2529300	It has to be a bruise of love.
2531300	2533300	It has to be a bruise of love, you know?
2533300	2535300	It can just be like anything.
2543300	2545300	So you're saying,
2545300	2547300	yeah.
2547300	2549300	Yeah, hickeys.
2549300	2551300	So that everyone knows that I belong to you.
2553300	2555300	Like your way
2555300	2557300	of marking me.
2563300	2565300	Maybe a little red bottom.
2565300	2567300	Yeah!
2567300	2569300	I want like your hand print.
2571300	2573300	Left on my bottoms.
2573300	2575300	That's how hard
2575300	2577300	I want you to do it.
2577300	2579300	I want you to do it like so strongly
2579300	2581300	that it leaves
2581300	2583300	like a mark
2583300	2585300	of your hand.
2589300	2591300	I would love that.
2591300	2593300	And also for it, you know,
2593300	2595300	to sting a bit
2595300	2597300	for a few minutes or so.
2597300	2599300	Because then the stinging
2599300	2601300	from the pain
2601300	2603300	reminds me
2603300	2605300	who I belong to.
2605300	2607300	You know?
2607300	2609300	Fuck!
2609300	2611300	I'm being so down bad already.
2611300	2613300	What the fuck?
2613300	2615300	I'm just chatting stream.
2615300	2617300	I'm just being down bad.
2617300	2619300	What the fuck?
2619300	2621300	I'm so sorry.
2621300	2623300	And then we can kiss it
2623300	2625300	to make it better, right?
2625300	2627300	Of course!
2627300	2629300	That would be very nice.
2629300	2631300	I feel really bad
2631300	2633300	because I have been streaming
2633300	2635300	for almost an hour
2635300	2637300	and I still didn't start playing the game.
2637300	2639300	Please tell me
2639300	2641300	if you want me to start the game.
2643300	2645300	Don't worry, you can tell me.
2651300	2653300	We like the chatting.
2653300	2655300	Please just talk more.
2655300	2657300	Yeah, I think you speak.
2657300	2659300	I know, but I'm supposed to play the game.
2663300	2665300	Whenever you want, don't worry.
2665300	2667300	I guess I'm scared
2667300	2669300	because I've been yapping for like an hour.
2671300	2673300	Almost an hour.
2673300	2675300	So I'm like, I know.
2675300	2677300	Also it's getting pretty hot in here.
2677300	2679300	Let me turn on my fan.
2687300	2689300	I feel better already.
2691300	2693300	Sorry, it was getting really hot in my room
2693300	2695300	so I had to turn my fan on.
2699300	2701300	And by fan, I mean you.
2701300	2703300	You're the fan that I turn on.
2703300	2705300	Fuck, I'm so cringe!
2709300	2711300	I'm so cringe.
2711300	2713300	What the fuck is my problem?
2713300	2715300	I need to turn my fan on.
2717300	2719300	My...
2719300	2721300	my small cringe wife!
2721300	2723300	Oh no.
2725300	2727300	RIS 100.
2727300	2729300	More like RIS minus 100.
2729300	2731300	That's how I feel right now.
2731300	2733300	You're very good at it.
2733300	2735300	Thank you, I'm glad you think so.
2735300	2737300	Okay, I can defend on what I see.

2868680	2870680	Oh my god.
2872680	2875680	I said we're gonna need to move to another site in this raid.
2875680	2878680	Oh no, no, no, bro, imagine.
2878680	2883680	Okay, listen, imagine I get fucking demonetized tomorrow
2884680	2886680	because of this fucking stream.
2889680	2897680	Imagine the demonetization stream celebration, oh my fucking god.
2900680	2904680	I love this cob, I love this mister.
2905680	2908680	No stopping, is that for another session of fun?
2908680	2910680	Okay, let's fucking go.
2914680	2923680	Oh, we love, we all love this cob and I love all of you.
2928680	2929680	Same for us though.
2932680	2942680	I'm flattered, really, I'm flattered that you can feel that way about me even though I'm being so fucking cringe most of the time.
2943680	2945680	And weird, I don't know.
2948680	2951680	YouTube, here's your monetization, reviews later stream.
2951680	2955680	Our second thought, let me get that back.
2955680	2958680	Bro, that would be so fucking bad.
2958680	2961680	That's why we're here.
2961680	2963680	Why?
2964680	2966680	Why are you here?
2967680	2969680	What is my problem?
2970680	2973680	Not me, literally asking you.
2973680	2977680	Okay, well why are you here?
2979680	2981680	Why are you here?
2982680	2984680	Just to suffer.
2987680	2990680	Why are you just to suffer?
2990680	2994680	That's terrible, I didn't want to suffer, I didn't want to be happy.
2995680	3004680	Holy fuck, for you Brad, that's so sweet.
3007680	3013680	Because you're unhinged, I'm glad you like how unhinged I am, thank you.
3015680	3019680	Why are we still here just to tease Icy?
3019680	3021680	I mean, that's fun.
3022680	3024680	We're here for Icy, let's be real.
3024680	3035680	I think that's very sweet if you are here for me because you genuinely like my company and like hanging out with me.
3035680	3038680	That is like the best compliment to be honest.
3038680	3048680	Because you know, some people only watch some stuff or only specific content that you make.
3048680	3067680	So when people like watch everything that you do because they genuinely like you and like your personality and everything around it, then that is like I feel like the best like biggest form of like a compliment for me.
3068680	3083680	So for those of you that are here and you know, say that you are here for me and stuff and all of that, thank you.
3083680	3088680	I really do appreciate it because it means a lot to me.
3088680	3093680	It means a lot to me and that's what I always wanted to be honest.
3093680	3114680	But I always wanted, like I always really wanted to, you know, people watch my streams and be here no matter what I do, you know, no matter if I play a game or just stock for people to be here because they genuinely just like my company, you know.
3114680	3122680	And that really means a lot to me because for me it's like whenever I stream, you know, it's like time for us to all like have fun.
3123680	3132680	Have some quality time together and hang out and do fun stuff and talk and, you know, so I really like it.
3132680	3134680	You make everything fun.
3134680	3136680	Oh, thank you.
3138680	3141680	I'm flattered, really, thank you.
3141680	3144680	And you're watching, you know, I'm sure I'm best to be here for streams.
3144680	3149680	Oh, thank you, but don't feel pressured.
3149680	3151680	Please don't feel pressured to be here.
3151680	3161680	You know, only be here if you genuinely want to, like don't be here because you feel bad for me or something, I guess, you know.
3161680	3164680	I could listen to you all day.
3164680	3166680	Oh, that's really sweet.
3166680	3169680	I'm glad to hear that.
3169680	3178680	I only get to every stream, I'll put stream on my cars because if I gotta, oh, the dedication, that's so sweet.
3178680	3180680	I want to be here.
3180680	3183680	I'm glad, I'm glad to hear that.
3186680	3187680	Done.
3187680	3189680	Let me drink some water.
3189680	3195680	My throat is getting a little bit sore from all the talking.
3195680	3198680	I wasn't expecting to be talking this much.
3198680	3203680	Like that wasn't the plan, but you make it so fun, you know.
3203680	3207680	You genuinely make it so fun to talk, like I could just talk and talk.
3210680	3212680	I'm glad to hear that.
3212680	3214680	I'm glad to hear that.
3214680	3216680	I'm glad to hear that.
3216680	3218680	I'm glad to hear that.
3218680	3220680	I'm glad to hear that.
3220680	3222680	I'm glad to hear that.
3222680	3224680	I'm glad to hear that.
3224680	3226680	I'm glad to hear that.
3226680	3228680	I'm glad to hear that.
3228680	3230680	I'm glad to hear that.
3230680	3232680	I'm glad to hear that.
3232680	3234680	I'm glad to hear that.
3234680	3236680	I'm glad to hear that.
3237680	3239680	That's much better.
3239680	3241680	I really needed that water.
3244680	3246680	Drink slowly, Princess.
3246680	3249680	I'm sorry, I was, I was so fricking thirsty.
3249680	3252680	I didn't realize how thirsty I was until I started drinking the water.
3252680	3256680	So I started fucking chugging it.
3257680	3259680	This is why I'm here.
3259680	3262680	Too wild, listen to me, drink water.

3406760	3408760	What the f***
3411320	3415720	I was literally just talking about it. What was I talking about?
3418280	3420040	Um
3420040	3422040	Of the icinate, I guess
3423080	3425080	But but what was I talking about specific?

3448680	3454440	Like it like if you're a digit at the generate, but you're also like wholesome and

3456840	3459960	Like and at the generate was in love, you know
3460760	3462760	Like that's like the best
3464600	3470280	To the sides of the same coin. Yeah, exactly best combo. Yeah, I agree
3474760	3480360	It's so cute how hype she gets with the yapping I can't help it. I'm genuinely like
3480760	3484280	I'm genuinely just having so much fun. Just talking to you right now
3484840	3487480	Not gonna lie. I'm just having fun
3488440	3491960	Talking to you and I'm responding to you and just
3493480	3495480	Just hanging out
3495560	3497560	Just talking about
3498600	3501720	Whatever whatever comes next, I guess
3503960	3507320	It's fun talking to you too. I'm glad you think so
3508200	3515800	I'm glad you think so, but I but I will admit like I do feel a bit bad, but I just still didn't start playing like I don't want to be annoying
3516680	3520840	What comes next? I mean, hopefully you
3522760	3524760	Hopefully you
3531960	3535960	You first no, no you first
3538040	3540040	Thank you for no
3542840	3544840	No you first
3545400	3547400	Why not both at the same time?
3548200	3552600	Okay, that would be that would be ideal. Yeah, that would be ideal
3557480	3559480	No you first
3561720	3567960	We gotta take care of our baby. Oh, that's really sweet both
3568760	3570760	Both is good
3571240	3573240	No you
3573800	3575800	No you come first
3575960	3577960	No you come first
3580440	3584280	Together just feels better. Yeah, that is true
3585960	3591160	That is like that's like that would be like so romantic right that would be like peak romance
3591960	3593960	But I feel like that's also like
3595000	3597000	Difficult to make it happen
3597800	3599800	I
3599800	3602600	Just be like wouldn't that be like difficult to make it happen
3608120	3610120	Countdown no
3617240	3622360	My god, what are we talking about this is fucking youtube
3627880	3632920	Not if you know the right spells, well, what what are the right spells?
3634200	3637720	Please do tell me I'm very I'm very intrigued
3643480	3648840	If you love the person and I feel make it work. Okay, that's also true. I agree with that
3651480	3653480	It does require some good timing
3657720	3659720	I
3659720	3665720	Mean there is no alternative not so for extremely sorry for viola right not at the moment, but
3667240	3672920	The plan is to have that like to have like another platform
3675000	3678360	For you know when we want to get like extra unhinged
3678920	3684440	I said that as if I'm not being unhinged already like right fucking now with talking about all this stuff
3687240	3694520	You'd be surprised what love based will power can do I agree the power of love is is truly strong
3699240	3702280	Sorry I keep muting myself I keep like having to clear my throat
3704920	3706920	The f1 or the c1
3711720	3714520	The the f1 the f1 I believe
3715240	3720840	I feel like I feel like the plan is definitely like the f1
3726840	3730840	That's the best part clearing throat ASMR is it I feel like that's
3732280	3737240	I feel like that's like not a pleasant sound to listen to like just hearing clear my fucking throat like
3738120	3741320	Whenever I play a game like I can't mute myself
3741400	3744360	So you do hear and clear my throat a lot, but
3744840	3750120	While we're chatting I can actually mute myself like when they clear my throat. So I guess it's like
3750760	3755880	The nice thing but I don't know if it's I don't know if I need to clear my throat so much because I talk so much
3756360	3763560	Like is that I feel like that's part of it like when I don't talk I don't feel like I need to clear my throat this often
3763560	3767320	Wait, this is not your full power. No, it's not
3767880	3769880	I become much much more
3770440	3773480	Powerful this is not my final form
3776280	3782360	I see needs to take up her power limiter I will eventually I will I will eventually
3784840	3790440	I mean I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine
3790680	3792680	I
3793080	3799480	Mean I'm already doing like a lot of stuff that you know, I really did not think I would be doing so
3800760	3802760	That's already like
3802760	3804760	A big thing on its own for myself
3806120	3810840	It's time to go even further behind. Yes, I agree
3811160	3815560	She will distress when her power is unleashed. Okay, I'll be honest. I don't know if that's even true
3816200	3821000	I don't know if it's even true because okay to be honest like like, yeah, you know, I
3822120	3826440	Like yeah, that's the plan to like have some streams like on the other side
3827640	3829640	The f side
3830360	3835880	Side fuck. I can't talk but like like realistically speaking the way that I know myself
3836520	3838520	I will be fine
3839000	3845400	I will be really fucking shy like I really don't know how what's gonna happen
3846600	3848920	Because I will be I feel like I'll be like
3849800	3852680	Really like extra shy and stuff because it's like
3853800	3855800	it's very different than
3857480	3863880	When you just record yourself and you're not talking to anyone
3866040	3867880	You know
3867960	3869480	So
3869480	3875000	I don't know how good it's gonna be like I don't even know what to expect like I don't even know what's gonna happen
3875400	3877480	I will be I will say that because
3878200	3884200	You know for all I know I would get so shy that like my body just fucking freezes, you know
3884920	3887800	Like that could happen as well. Who knows
3889080	3893480	So I don't want to like make any promises like I don't want you to have like high expectations of me
3894120	3897560	When it comes to that because again, I don't know how my body's gonna react like
3898840	3900840	When stuff like that actually will happen
3901960	3905080	Because I might just get so shy and nervous that it just frees up
3908200	3911080	So I feel like it will probably just like
3912680	3914680	Lead up to it maybe
3915880	3918360	With with time or stuff like that
3922680	3925800	It's okay, just do what you feel comfortable with doing
3926360	3929320	Thank you. Thank you for being understanding about that
3931720	3933880	Oh, it's all good got your own pace
3934760	3936760	Yeah, thank you
3937160	3939320	Thank you for being understanding about it and
3940440	3943160	Not like I guess pressuring me about it because
3943800	3945160	Because you know like
3945160	3950200	Being pressured about it would just like make it a lot worse and make the anxiety like
3951400	3953400	Even more about
3956760	3961720	Just do what makes you comfortable. I see. Yeah, I I will I will
3962760	3964760	Because if I'm not comfortable then
3965880	3968120	It's it's not gonna be good for anyone
3970760	3975160	Oh, these things will make you feel comfortable. That's that's what I'm hoping for
3975960	3977960	That's what I'm hoping for like
3980120	3982520	Like in the ideal scenario like
3983080	3985080	Even if I am nervous
3986280	3988280	And really shy about it
3988680	3990520	You'll be able to like
3990520	3992680	Make me really comfortable about it
3993720	3998760	And stuff like that, but the things you say to me and how how sweet you are to me
3999320	4005480	That's I guess that's like what I'm hoping for but I get I don't know how I'm going to react
4009320	4015080	I'll be by your side supporting your art, baby. Oh, that's really sweet
4016600	4019960	I can imagine here ice using an ice cube
4023400	4029640	I'm going to have to throw a sickie or something for that first f stream if I am at work
4030360	4035160	Oh, wow the dedication. Oh my god, that would be so funny imagine. I'm like announcing
4035960	4038360	My first like f stream
4039480	4043240	And all of you just take a day of work in that fat
4043960	4049000	Oh my god, that would be fucking crazy
4051640	4054040	The amount of dedication is insane
4056280	4058920	We'll need the whole day maybe a week
4061640	4063640	A whole week
4064440	4066440	Let's go
4067400	4071240	One week stream on the f side
4073240	4075240	Oh god
4077000	4080760	I have some overtime saved up so I could take a day off or two
4081880	4083880	That's nice
4084680	4086680	Worth it
4089480	4092040	A lot of us would definitely do it if needed
4092440	4097960	I feel like that's I feel like that's pretty pretty cute like pretty sweet, you know
4098760	4104760	If you would like take the day off just for that, you know, that's really sweet
4106600	4109400	Woo f side and stream
4109960	4111960	Oh, no
4113560	4118520	You always speaking speaking of f side speaking of f side, you know what I want to do eventually
4119560	4124040	You know what I want to do eventually I want to like do like a spankathon or something like that
4124600	4126600	like I want to get a paddle and
4127080	4131960	For like every like tip or something I just smack myself
4133800	4136440	In the bot but like a paddle
4139800	4141800	So it would be like a spankathon
4145000	4148600	I always thought like that would be like a really fun idea
4149880	4151880	Send it send what
4152600	4154600	Send what
4155400	4160120	You might break. I don't know. I'm I think I can do it
4162440	4164440	I think I can do it
4165640	4168280	Oh, that sounds nice. It sounds fun, right?
4168840	4170840	Right like that's it's fun
4171080	4175160	Like like before I even like joined the allure. I actually like wrote
4176200	4179240	In my application when they asked about like
4179880	4182040	Ideas I was actually like
4182360	4186040	I think it would be really cool if we did like a spankathon or something like that
4186520	4191400	So I already like back then like already like I had the idea to do it send it do it
4191800	4198760	Okay, well, I'm sorry. Okay. I'm dumb sometimes you say stuff and I don't know what you mean. Okay. I'm sorry. Okay
4201880	4205400	This is a premium idea. Thank you. I'm glad you think so
4206360	4208360	I think that would be really fun
4209400	4211400	and then you'll get to
4211560	4213560	hear me just
4214200	4216200	suffer and
4217160	4219160	Smack my bottoms
4219400	4221400	Until they sting so much
4222440	4224440	It's unbearable
4233560	4235960	I think a few jissens would go overboard
4237000	4239640	I will need to think smartly about it like
4240600	4245720	I will need to think smartly about it definitely can't it can't cannot
4246600	4253560	Be one dollar because I would fucking die like like assuming that people like will go crazy
4253880	4257480	I don't want to risk that you know, I don't want to risk that you know
4258440	4260920	Like I would just spankathon, but I also want to like
4261960	4265400	Be able to still sit on my ass after it, you know
4267000	4269000	I don't know what I mean
4270600	4272600	What's the minimum
4273560	4275000	I don't know
4275000	4279560	Honestly, I have no idea. I'm scared like I generally don't know what would be like
4280360	4287080	A minimum for that. I'm I'm scared of making it like too low and then like someone just goes fucking crazy
4288040	4290680	You know like that would be so bad
4291320	4300200	Okay, but what's it like this spankathon if you can sit right after well if I can't sit
4301320	4305960	Like for a few days because of it that means I can't really string because I'll be like
4306760	4308760	paying from sitting
4309160	4311960	One of the other girls may have some thoughts. Yeah
4312840	4319880	Okay, you're right. Yeah, that is true. I could ask I could probably ask scrawny about it and ask her
4320840	4322840	Opinion what she thinks would be good
4323960	4325960	That's not a bad idea at all
4327800	4329800	Here's your tip
4331880	4333880	Thanks for your tip
4337720	4339720	Thanks, you know what I
4341880	4343880	Very nice
4350680	4352680	Oh
4354120	4356120	My god
4359400	4365320	Your floating skills are amazing. Are you being sarcastic? I I can't tell if you're being sarcastic
4366120	4370840	Or if you genuinely mean it. I I can't tell if you're just being sarcastic when you say that
4377160	4380520	He may be sarcastic, but I mean it
4381480	4383480	But mean what
4384520	4390280	That I have Riz or do you mean something else? No, he's genuine. Really? Do you think so?
4391640	4393640	She has accidental Riz
4396920	4399400	Uh, apparently according to you
4400600	4406440	You could do light slabs for low amounts and heavier ones for big donuts. Oh, that's actually
4407320	4409320	That's something to think about wait
4410760	4416200	Wait, that is something to think about that's actually maybe that would be a good idea
4417720	4422680	Hmm, is it a good idea? What what do the rest of you think about it?
4424760	4427880	Do you think it's a good idea if for light slabs
4428440	4432280	For low amounts and heavier ones for big donuts?
4433080	4440120	Like like if it's like a low amount like a smaller amount I slap it with my hand and
4441080	4445960	And if it's like a high amount I slap it with like an actual like
4446920	4448200	paddle
4448200	4451880	You know like an actual like paddle that will like hurt
4454440	4460200	Definitely better than a heavy slap for all donuts. Yeah, I think maybe that would make it more fun too
4462040	4464040	I don't know
4464280	4466280	Hahaha
4470360	4473080	Sounds fun sounds good
4474120	4477960	What is going on just got back from dinner? Oh god
4479240	4481240	um
4482200	4484200	Um
4484520	4486520	I mean, I don't even know how to tell you
4486760	4488760	Someone someone let let him know
4489320	4492840	Someone let him know what we're talking about because because I don't know how to
4493800	4495800	I don't know how to easily explain
4499400	4502840	Kino stream brainstorming and flirting session
4504760	4509160	Spanko who's gonna tell him does he know
4511160	4513160	Does he know
4516520	4518520	Oh
4519160	4521160	My god
4524040	4527240	He doesn't know no he doesn't
4529160	4531640	Only the real ones will know this
4540040	4544200	Guys remind me again that we went to a gameplay stream to a zazoo to spank
4544920	4549880	Yes, we did and you know what I think that's amazing
4551240	4553240	I think that's amazing
4554360	4558840	I love that we can just do whatever I love that we can just do whatever I love that
4559880	4561880	We can just talk
4561960	4563960	And and have fun doing just that
4565160	4567160	You know, I think it's really nice
4567240	4569240	I
4569800	4573800	See still confused, but I see wait, what what are you confused about like?
4575560	4577800	What what are you exactly confused about?
4579240	4582040	This is why I do my best to tune in live whenever I can
4582520	4586520	Yeah, because because if you're not if you're not here when it's live
4587080	4589640	Then you know, you you will feel like the
4590440	4591880	FOMO
4591880	4597080	Really hard I guess and I feel bad for it because like I know there's people who like want to watch
4597240	4601480	Me live, but they can't because of time zones and schedules and stuff
4602040	4605960	And I feel so sad for them, you know, like it makes me sad because it's like
4607160	4612760	It's like fuck. I wish I could like just make everyone happy, you know, but I know that
4613240	4614840	realistically I
4614840	4619400	I can't do that. I can do my best to try and make
4620920	4622920	Many happy I guess but
4623640	4628040	I can I'm not going to be able to appeal to like every single person
4628920	4631320	Sadly, like, you know, I wish I could but
4632520	4634280	uh
4634280	4637160	I'm just a tiny little cop who is trying her best

4643800	4645800	Vital physics
4646200	4649800	Are pretty hard to get on. What is our vital physics?
4650440	4655400	Our vital physics are vital. I probably mispronouncing and they sound like a fucking idiot
4656280	4659080	Our vital physics. Yeah, how do you say?

4690760	4692760	Bit L
4693880	4695720	Bit L
4695720	4697720	Basically space physics
4697800	4699800	Ah
4700440	4706120	Okay, space physics. Well, just say space physics that I'm too stupid to know
4707080	4711400	Complicated words like that. I'm just a cop. You can't just be like
4712200	4713880	vital
4713880	4718920	Something something I'm I'm too little for that. I don't know what the fuck that means

5280680	5285800	I wish I could give you like an actual answer, but I genuinely don't know
5288440	5292040	Polar Bearstone hibernate. Yeah, that's true
5292840	5300440	It's important to keep count especially around tax season. What the fuck does me jerking off has to do with tax season
5300760	5304440	What are they gonna tax me for jerking off multiple times a day?
5305080	5307080	No
5307080	5309080	The fuck are you talking about?
5312440	5316280	Polar Bear's pay taxes, no
5317080	5320680	They don't but that's why I'm happy. I have daddy
5320680	5322680	Cause daddy can pay my taxes for me
5337320	5340840	You guys haven't paid your shark tax yet
5344920	5349320	First time I've ever been happy about my career short
5350920	5359320	Wait, why wait? I'm stupid. I don't understand what you mean. Wait. What do you say that?
5360040	5362040	Why would you say that?
5362360	5364360	I see tax
5364360	5367640	A pay in white money come money
5369480	5372840	Wait, which tax are we paying the come tax?
5373240	5375240	I
5378360	5380360	Rest knocking on your door right now
5385640	5391240	But imagine if you don't pay your taxes what happens is the irx irs
5391720	5395560	Knocks on your door, and they just start fucking gang banging you
5402840	5404840	I
5422360	5425000	Know that's like the first thing that came to my mind
5425720	5431880	When when one of their gsads was talking about like the irs knocking on the door
5433080	5435080	First thought was
5435080	5439000	Wait, why are they knocking on the door just because I jerk off multiple times a day?
5439800	5441960	Is that how you pay them the taxes? Is it like
5444440	5446440	Fucking
5450840	5452840	I'm sorry
5454280	5458680	Is how you don't pay taxes in the hopes they restart
5459560	5461560	Running a train
5462440	5464440	No
5468600	5473000	No, I I I will only have a train with my daddy's
5476680	5482440	Only only train of love here no iris trains allowed
5483320	5489320	Only train of love with with gsads who are truly in love with me
5492040	5495320	This dream is fucking perfect. I see thank you
5496520	5501800	I I generally was not expecting to like go live and just fucking talking on stop, but
5502520	5504520	It just naturally happened so
5505240	5509000	And i'm having fun so like you know, why should why should I stop doing it?
5509160	5514280	You know if i'm having fun, why should I stop having fun when I can just keep on having fun?
5515400	5518920	Bro that was like the dumbest shit i've said in a while the fuck was that
5519320	5521320	Ah
5523960	5527560	If you really love someone you pay their cop tax
5529720	5533000	I don't even know what game you were gonna play
5533560	5538520	And it says in the title it says in the title the name of the game that I was gonna play
5538520	5549640	Now that's my next step to wait, what's your next step?

7075800	7078520	uh after I end the stream what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna like
7079400	7081400	change the thumbnail

7090360	7092360	and change the thumbnail

7894680	7901000	Like I know that like you hear my alerts, but for some reason I don't hear them and that's why like
7902040	7904040	Even though i'm like just chatting I
7905160	7907160	Like end up not noticing
7907960	7910360	That there has been any donations
7911080	7914760	Which is fucking annoying. I'm gonna have to ask the
7915480	7917480	I'm gonna have to ask manisan how to
7918440	7920440	Get that fixed because
7921560	7926520	For just chatting streams, I would like to be able to hear the alerts. I guess
7928840	7930120	But
7930120	7932120	I can deal with that later
7932520	7936120	We don't hear alert we can only see them on screen wait really
7936760	7940840	Because I have like the sound for the alerts like on on my OBS
7941640	7943240	I hear the alerts
7943240	7946440	Okay, so apparently some of you hear it and some of you don't

7957400	7960360	My gratitude, you know and thank everybody because
7961240	7964360	Because it's not a given, you know, it never is
7965400	7967400	So so genuinely thank you so much
7968600	7971160	There is a pink, but it's super duper faint. Um
7972760	7977320	Do I keep it faint though? Like I don't want it to be like annoying for you, you know like should it
7977560	7979560	Should it just stay faint?
7980280	7982280	because I mean
7983320	7987560	I don't want it to be like an annoying sound for all of you, you know
7991720	7996520	I don't have much money, but I'll give you all my time. Thank you. I appreciate it
7997080	8001720	I mean, I mean, that's like that's like the thing right like you can you can support

8005640	8009240	It really doesn't need to be financially all the time. There's so many ways to
8010360	8012280	to support
8012280	8018120	The people you love so again, like don't feel ever pressured, you know, we're living
8018680	8020680	We're living in a really like
8021240	8025080	Fucked up timeline where inflation is fucking crazy
8025960	8027960	like everyone like
8028360	8030760	Like majority of people really struggle because
8031720	8034760	Just everything just gets more and more expensive as time goes so like
8036440	8038440	Yeah, please don't ever feel like
8039320	8042440	Basically don't do anything stupid and don't feel pressured to do that
8045080	8048760	Can I support you with piggyback rides? Yeah, of course
8052040	8057240	Inflation is kicking by my butt. I know inflation fucking sucks
8058200	8061640	Fuck that shit it pisses me off so much like
8062520	8064520	What the fuck, you know
8065160	8067160	ah
8067640	8070120	I'll keep the right amount of stupid
8071320	8075800	Okay, okay, that that's that sounds like a good idea like a balanced
8076360	8078840	A balanced amount of stupid
8080600	8083960	Should be okay if we don't go overboard with it
8084680	8086680	McDonald's like
8087400	8089880	Double in price the past two years
8090680	8092680	Okay, real
8092680	8094680	True
8094680	8102120	I see for a president should make inflation disappear. I don't think that someone as stupid as me
8102760	8105400	Should be a president to be honest
8106120	8111960	I don't I don't know if I would actually make things worse in the world just because I'm dumb and I don't know what I'm doing
8114040	8116040	I
8121400	8123400	Sorry, I was licking my lips
8125320	8127320	Sorry, sorry

8165400	8170840	Sorry, sorry, I'm getting carried away. I'm having fun making stupid faces

9576440	9580840	I wouldn't kill anyone, you know, I wouldn't like murder anyone over it
9583640	9585640	That would hurt even worse
9586600	9588600	I mean, yeah
9589880	9591880	Yeah
9593400	9595400	What kind of dare do you think you are?
9596520	9598520	Um, I'm actually not sure
9599800	9601800	I'm actually not sure because
9602280	9605960	I'm really bad at like understanding my personality
9607160	9609160	like
9609160	9613080	I don't know if that makes sense, but I find it like hard to understand
9614120	9618920	What kind of person I am it's a lot easier for me if people tell me
9619880	9621880	How they see me
9622840	9627160	Because whenever people ask me stuff like oh, what's your personality like or
9628680	9632600	What type like this and this are you and I'm like
9633880	9636680	I genuinely don't know because I feel like I have sometimes like
9637880	9639880	different like
9640200	9642200	qualities of different personalities
9643000	9649720	And you know, it changes on like the situation and the people I'm around with, you know
9650680	9653160	So it's for me. It's hard to tell what I'm like
9654200	9655800	and
9655800	9659240	It's easier if people just tell me how they see me, I guess
9660360	9662360	And go from that
9666680	9671880	That's normal, it's almost impossible to know yourself with people showing you the person they seen you. Yeah, I feel like it's
9672840	9675960	I think it's like pretty like complicated for me to
9676920	9681320	Like I've always had a problem with that to be honest like I never was
9682280	9684280	I don't know. It's just complicated
9687640	9691960	I saw whole horn. Thank you so much for the $10 donation
9692440	9697880	After my trial where I was found to not be the cheater. I would like to demand
9698840	9708360	Reparations for this wrongful accusation in the form of free isenate. That is all oh and I see
9712280	9715240	Thank you so much. Thank you for the $10 donation
9716120	9721000	I literally already gave isenate yesterday. Come on like
9722040	9724760	Come on. You had it yesterday. You can
9725720	9730040	You can't wait a day without it. You don't need it every fucking day
9732680	9734920	Personality quiz stream when okay, so
9736760	9739720	My personality like you know, there's like that one big test
9740440	9741480	um
9741480	9744040	That everyone takes to like know your personality type
9744760	9746760	uh, so
9746760	9748280	I don't
9748280	9750280	Let me look up
9751240	9753000	Uh
9753080	9756200	I don't know if that helps or not, but uh
9758120	9760760	My personality type is uh, I
9761800	9763800	nfp
9764360	9766360	But apparently there's like two
9766520	9768840	Apparently there's like two different, uh
9769800	9773560	Like sub categories to that personality as well
9774520	9779560	Uh, and I can't remember which sub type I am
9780680	9782680	Uh, I can't remember
9783080	9785080	What's the difference between the
9786120	9790760	Two types of them. I can't remember which which one I am, but uh
9792280	9794280	nfp
9795160	9797160	Types
9797160	9799160	Where is where is uh
9800680	9802680	Sorry, I'm trying to google it
9804360	9806360	What is uh
9808520	9811960	And what is so there is I nfp a
9813160	9815160	And there is I nfp
9815560	9817560	I nfp t
9818120	9820120	So there's like two different ones
9821160	9823160	and
9825080	9827080	I don't remember which
9828280	9830280	One I am to be honest
9832840	9834840	So
9835960	9838600	So yeah, I I I don't
9840040	9842040	I don't remember
9842520	9847880	I know like that like generally that I am I nfp like I've taken the test
9849400	9851160	Quite of times
9851160	9858120	Uh before so like it's confirmed like it's confirmed confirmed that that's my personality type because I've taken that that's like
9858600	9860040	many times
9860040	9862040	In my life
9866920	9868920	But yeah, I'm very like
9869000	9871240	Emotion like driven and
9872200	9874520	Like creativity driven and
9876040	9878040	All that stuff and yeah
9883000	9885000	Pretty sure I'm I and
9886360	9888360	GT
9889240	9892040	Oh man, there's I I don't even I would have to like
9893320	9895320	Google all this
9896920	9899320	There's I n t j
9900280	9902280	And there is I
9902280	9904280	And j t
9906200	9908440	Right like those are two different ones
9911560	9913560	Can you draw or paint well, um
9914440	9916520	I used to draw a lot as a kid
9917400	9922040	I would like whenever I would watch cartoons and stuff. I would get like paper
9922840	9927640	And try to draw as I was like watching the cartoon and stuff like that
9928600	9932440	And and eventually I got pretty decent at it and
9934520	9937160	You know, I was drawing more and stuff like that and
9939560	9945480	And then like at some point in my life, I did a lot of stuff related to
9947080	9951480	Related around art like I was there was like this one time that I
9953000	9955000	went to like
9955720	9957720	I volunteered at like a gallery
9958760	9959800	and
9959800	9961960	And I had like one like some
9963960	9969400	I had some of my I used to like do photography stuff as well. So I used to have like
9970360	9973320	Some of my photography on like the gallery
9974280	9975720	exhibition
9975720	9977000	That I was like
9977000	9981640	Created I was like a curator of that exhibition with some other girls
9982280	9985640	We were like in the group and so I was like contacting like
9986280	9988280	multiple photographers that I really
9988840	9990840	love their photography and so
9991800	9994520	We had like an exhibition in that gallery and then
9996280	9998280	And then another time I
9998760	10000680	I made like
10000680	10002680	some art and
10002760	10005000	And I had it like in a museum
10005640	10007240	exhibition
10007240	10011400	And that was like a big thing for me like I remember like both of my parents
10012920	10014920	Coming to the museum
10015160	10020760	Back then to look at it and and I was feeling like really proud and happy and my parents were like
10021400	10029080	Wow, look at her go. She she has her art like in the museum exhibition and I was like
10030120	10032120	I was so happy that uh
10032840	10034840	I was able to make them
10035160	10036840	And proud
10036840	10043400	And any chance they're still there, they're not because you know, it was it was an exhibition and you know exhibitions are like usually
10045000	10047000	They're there for like
10047160	10049160	A certain amount of time
10049320	10051320	And then you know, they change them
10051800	10055400	Like there's museums where it's like, you know permanent like stuff and then they
10056120	10058280	Sometimes hold exhibitions
10060040	10064200	And stuff like the world famous artists. I said nothing else. Nah
10064360	10067880	I'm not not anything like that. Not anything like that, but
10068760	10071560	But back then I was yeah back then I was like really
10072440	10073880	back then
10073880	10077080	That was like my big thing back then I was hoping to like
10078520	10080520	Focus on art and
10081720	10083720	And make like a career out of it, but
10084840	10086040	uh
10086040	10090440	But then eventually I realized that like it's not for me because like there was a time when I
10091320	10093320	would take um
10093800	10095800	commissions for art
10096280	10097560	and
10097560	10100280	And basically from that experience I
10101480	10103480	I realized that
10103480	10105480	it's it's not
10106360	10112440	It's it's not for me, you know, I rest it's not for me because whenever someone would commission me I
10113560	10115560	I would uh
10116360	10120600	I would get really anxious like I would get really anxious and nervous and
10121560	10123560	You know overthink like
10123640	10126040	Every line that I do I would constantly be
10126680	10131480	Scared and nervous that it's gonna look like shit or that it's not gonna be good enough and
10132040	10136760	And so because of the commissions is actually why I stopped like
10137960	10139960	drawing like
10140360	10141320	Because
10141320	10145160	It it was no longer like a fun thing for me to do
10146120	10150760	It was just like something that made me feel like all these negative emotions
10151880	10153880	And when I was a kid
10154200	10156520	And before that like I used to just draw
10157480	10162040	To like express myself or like draw things that I like or
10163160	10164760	um
10164760	10166760	I mean my art was like
10168360	10171240	Pretty pretty weird let's put it that way because
10172040	10174360	It was something like I remember um
10174920	10178920	At school I I used to like take uh
10180840	10184920	I majored like art and like
10185880	10187400	like
10187400	10188920	school and
10188920	10191560	They had like this like big exam thing
10192280	10194280	Where they give you like
10194360	10195640	um
10195640	10198440	Like a really big art project to work on
10199480	10201480	and then like
10201480	10204680	If you like art teachers like check it and
10205640	10210040	You know they give you like a score based of it and all that stuff and
10210920	10212040	um
10212040	10214040	basically my project
10214040	10216040	um for that was
10217160	10219160	Just mainly like
10219720	10221720	My my art project was uh
10222200	10225800	Based on the different parts of my personality
10225880	10231080	So I basically drew like a couple of different artworks that I felt
10232200	10237880	Showcased and represented like parts of my personality and different sides of me
10238600	10242840	So some of them would be like really weird or morbid
10244680	10247480	Some of them would even like include like
10248360	10251960	Like portraits of like people that meant a lot to me
10253880	10255880	Some of them would include like something
10257720	10260120	More like cute and stuff like that
10260920	10265640	And you know it was like kind of over the place but surprisingly uh
10267000	10270120	Surprisingly I got like the highest score
10271480	10274920	I got I got surprisingly the highest score in that exam out of
10275720	10278120	Everyone and I remember um
10279160	10284280	The person who was like, you know giving the scores and checking it telling me that
10285400	10287400	Like I don't know that I was like
10287720	10290680	Extremely creative or something like that and
10292120	10294040	I don't know
10294040	10297480	Stuff like that, but you know eventually with time
10298280	10300280	uh, I just started like
10301880	10303400	Uh
10303400	10307320	Doing art less and less, you know like uh
10309000	10314760	I'm I'm just all about making shitty ugly doodles with my fucking mouse
10315720	10324040	At this point of my life because it's stress-free. It's it's funny. It's stress-free. It's funny. I
10325320	10330920	If it looks like shit, it makes it even funnier. So I don't know. It's it's just not really
10332200	10335160	Not really my thing anymore, you know sometimes sometimes
10336840	10339800	As you grow up like you're still trying to figure out yourself, right?
10339800	10342680	So there will be times when like you've had hobbies that you
10343560	10345560	Were extremely
10345640	10347640	passionate with and
10347960	10352120	That you really thought you're going to make like a career out of them or something and then
10353000	10359000	As time goes by and like different things happen to you in life and you gain different experiences like
10359960	10363880	You know, sometimes you just don't feel anything about
10365480	10368120	Those hobbies anymore. They don't make you happy anymore
10368920	10372840	So that's I guess that's kind of how it was for me for me and learn
10373720	10378440	I just like making ugly funny silly doodles with my mouse and
10379320	10383720	That's that's the enjoyment. That's like the most enjoyment that I get out of
10384520	10387480	Making art if you can call it that
10388920	10396040	Um, but if you want, uh, I could show you like I have um, I actually have some of the art
10396200	10401800	That I made for that big art project exam back then. I have some
10402920	10404440	Pictures of it
10404440	10410440	I could show you but I also don't want to like weird you out. It's like because like I don't know
10411800	10416200	I don't know if like the art that I made back then like would make you like think weirdly of me because
10417080	10420120	Some of it is like really weird or maybe like
10421400	10423480	I don't know. I don't know
10423960	10427960	I don't know. That was just really something
10430760	10433480	Art is subjective weird way. Yeah art is
10435000	10438040	Art is art like it can be anything and
10439400	10441880	A way to express yourself
10442600	10444600	Oh, please. I would love to see
10444760	10446120	um
10446120	10448600	Maybe maybe I will I will show it eventually
10449560	10457400	Well, I'll have parts of our past that no longer apply but still explain how we got to where we are. Yeah, I think that's definitely true
10458840	10461240	I I definitely agree like
10462840	10464840	They were like part of
10465960	10467720	Like our
10467720	10469720	development as
10469720	10471720	A person
10471880	10473320	You know
10473320	10476200	That's why I also think that like if like
10477160	10482360	Maybe you if someone like did do something bad in the past
10482920	10485800	And and I'm not talking about like extremes here
10486440	10488920	Like, you know, but I'm talking about like
10489960	10493560	You know, like more generally like speaking stuff
10494520	10495720	Uh
10495720	10500440	Fuck what am I even trying to say? I'm just trying to say that like it's
10501400	10505880	It's part of your growth and and it's part of your growth and at the end of the day
10505960	10508680	What I think really really matters at the end of the day
10509560	10511560	is that
10511880	10514840	You you strive to be a better person and that you
10516040	10518440	You know want to be better and
10519160	10520760	you know like
10520760	10524840	That like you are self aware. I think self awareness is very important
10525800	10527880	I don't know if that makes sense what I'm trying to say
10528440	10530440	I'm kind of just yapping
10530760	10532760	around and
10532760	10536280	Basically don't focus too much on what you did in the past
10536920	10540200	And just have self aware awareness to know that like, yeah
10541000	10547320	You know what I did back then was like really shitty or really bad and I don't want to ever do that again
10548200	10550600	I don't I don't want to be that person or
10552760	10554760	Stuff like that and just like
10555880	10557800	Make growth
10557880	10559480	out of that
10559480	10565480	I don't know why I'm talking about that. I feel like it's so weird that I'm talking about this stuff right now. I'm sorry if it's like
10566680	10571640	Really like too serious or like a really weird thing to talk about. I don't
10572600	10576920	Uh, I'm just like I'm just rambling honestly at this point
10579320	10582840	Learn from the past grow as a person. Yeah, exactly
10584200	10586360	I think I think the end goal is
10587240	10590840	To be the best version of yourself that you can be
10592120	10594120	and
10594120	10596120	And as I always say
10596440	10598440	as I always say
10598680	10600680	Being your authentic self
10601480	10603480	easier ideal self
10604040	10607400	I don't know. I I just I don't keep repeating that quote, but
10608680	10610680	Whenever I get insecure or
10611400	10613400	nervous I
10613400	10615400	I keep reminding it to myself
10616920	10618920	And
10619880	10622200	Is this how the pillow talk is gonna be like
10624440	10626440	I don't know. I don't know

10707240	10709240	What I am as a person, I guess

10749160	10761000	We know just be safe, you know, we still want you here. Yeah. Yeah, I I know I I try to be as
10762120	10764680	As good as I can be about my
10766360	10768360	Uh, what's the word ops?
10768600	10770200	Ops bag
10770200	10773640	Ops bag. I don't remember something about that
10775560	10777800	And we enjoy spoiling you so it works
10779320	10783240	Yeah, but like the thing is you enjoy spoiling me but
10784120	10787560	I I sometimes like feel like guilty and like
10789240	10792440	Like bad and you know about it because I'm like
10793640	10799800	I don't feel like I I deserve like I really didn't do much, you know, like I didn't I don't know
10799800	10801800	You
10805960	10811240	Make us feel so good that we want to make you feel good in return. Oh, that's really sweet
10812360	10815960	All of you really make me happy like genuinely
10820120	10822520	I I can't remember exactly but
10824200	10829240	Uh, I can't remember exactly what she be was talking about in one of her streams
10830600	10832600	I think maybe yesterday, but
10833240	10835240	She was saying something that
10836040	10843240	I felt a similar way about you know, like like, you know how sometimes like I get worried and I'm like
10846280	10850200	You know like overthinking stuff overthinking the future and
10852920	10857560	And just like think about it too much. I'm like like I feel a similar way that
10858120	10860120	She be does in the sense that like
10861080	10863320	I just I just want everyone to
10864120	10866120	To be happy, you know and like
10868360	10869960	And like
10869960	10873480	Some of us are like really deep in it
10874840	10876840	More and more every day and
10878680	10885400	And like that part is scary when I overthink it overthink it because I think about the future and I'm like
10886360	10891000	I don't I don't want to hurt anyone, you know, like at the end of the day
10891000	10894680	I want everyone to be happy and I guess when I think about the future it scares me because I
10896600	10898600	I don't want to
10899880	10902840	Break anyone's heart, you know, I don't
10906120	10909640	I I want everyone to be happy, you know and
10909960	10911960	And
10912760	10915640	When you get like so deep in it like you can't help but
10917560	10922280	Think about the future and like overthinking and be like
10924120	10927160	Uh think about like what ifs or
10929560	10932760	And I'm trying not to think like that, you know, I'm trying not to think like that
10932760	10935960	I'm trying to really just live in the moment and
10936680	10939400	And enjoy the present because that is
10941560	10945720	That is exactly the best way to live, right? But when you are
10946680	10952680	In it like really deep it it feels really difficult not to think about that stuff
10956840	10962040	Like I don't know so I guess it's like I don't know I don't know what I'm
10962840	10968040	I don't even know what like the point I'm trying to make is honestly, I just
10969240	10972200	I don't know. I just I just want everyone to be happy and I
10973480	10979000	And it's scary, you know scared because I'm I'm scared of anyone ever like
10981560	10985080	Getting hurt or anything like that like
10987080	10989080	I don't know
10989080	10991080	I don't know how how to word it
10992040	10993800	but
10993800	10995800	basically
10995800	10997800	Yeah a similar feeling to
10998680	11002840	What she be was talking about yesterday. I think it was yesterday. Um
11003800	11007080	No, it wasn't yesterday or was it
11008360	11012360	I don't I don't remember there was like a stream where she talked about something similar and
11013160	11015160	I was like, yeah like
11016360	11019880	Sometimes I would think that and I'm trying my best not to I really am
11020840	11022840	Trying to you know
11024200	11026200	Just enjoy the present but
11026680	11028680	It's so difficult, you know
11028680	11032040	It's it's so difficult like not think about it, you know
11033400	11038840	Like because you don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. You want everyone to be happy
11040520	11042520	Like I generally want
11043320	11045800	Everyone that's been really kind and sweet to me have
11046680	11048680	a really good life and
11048760	11051240	Be happy, you know like and
11053160	11056120	It would just feel so horrible to like hurt anyone and
11057800	11059800	Because I don't know
11061240	11064280	Feelings I feel
11066920	11071800	Just gonna randomly end the stream again and exit obs because I feel
11074280	11076280	I feel
11078760	11082200	I understand always be here and it's okay. I know what you mean. Yeah
11083800	11085800	How how does one
11086920	11088920	Not think about it. How does one just
11090760	11093800	Stop worrying about it like how do you even do that?
11097480	11104120	I feel bad like this is like this is like a heavy conversation we're having and I feel like really bad
11104200	11106200	I
11107720	11115880	Feelings are complicated and love especially but it's all worth it. Yeah, it is complicated
11120120	11124680	Uh, I couldn't answer that alone, but I feel
11126360	11128360	The way I feel
11128440	11132200	Uh, no point to do me when you can be blooming
11134280	11136280	Uh
11137800	11139800	True
11140200	11141960	True
11141960	11143960	I don't know if it gives an anime
11144920	11147800	I'm sorry, but I feel my emotions extremely strong
11149800	11153080	I don't think because an anime would like fix my fucking
11154040	11158600	Depression if I got like extremely fucking sad or something happened, you know
11159640	11161640	That would like
11161640	11163640	That would be like sad
11164760	11167320	I'm happy as long as I seen is happy
11168760	11170760	And I'm happy as long as you're happy
11172600	11174600	Sorry
11177160	11180280	I love you even if I can't be there next to you
11180280	11183560	I never thought I could be the spur of social before I started watching
11184280	11186280	You uh, I
11186840	11191240	That's really sweet. I I I actually feel the same way like I never
11192040	11195000	Felt like this before, you know
11196440	11198440	Like in my past
11199320	11202360	When I did stream like I never felt like
11203800	11207800	Like this much like this is like a whole like another
11209400	11217160	10 20 like levels of it, you know what I mean like it's it's like completely different than like anything I've ever experienced so
11218120	11220120	So yeah, it's
11221160	11223160	It's it's really something
11228520	11231160	I don't think you can stop the emotion
11232280	11236440	You just have to take the good and bad as they are. Yeah
11237480	11239480	That's true
11242440	11246280	Do you make this mister feel like a teenager in love again?
11247560	11249560	The ultimate fountain of youth
11250600	11252600	That's really sweet actually
11253000	11256680	I think I think it's really sweet when some of you say that like
11257640	11259640	Stuff like that like, you know like
11260680	11262680	Make you feel young again or like
11263480	11265480	bring youth or
11265720	11268120	Stuff like that. I think that's really sweet
11268760	11279960	It's because of the nature of not say for not say for work work. I I disagree
11280840	11282600	I
11282600	11284600	Don't think that's why
11284600	11288040	I don't think that's why and I'll tell you why I used to
11288760	11290760	Before I even started v2 being
11292040	11294040	I used to do
11294040	11296040	Only fans
11296760	11298760	I used to do only fans for a few years and
11299480	11302040	You know like taking like pictures of myself
11302840	11305000	and like some cosplays and
11305800	11307800	stuff like that and
11308760	11313640	I never felt that way with like anybody, you know like the people who would
11314520	11316520	message me, you know
11317320	11319320	Or stuff like that like
11319960	11321960	I I never
11322520	11325000	I never felt like per social with them
11325800	11330600	So I don't I don't think it's I don't think it's because of the nature
11331480	11333000	of the
11333000	11335000	not say for work
11335320	11337320	Thing because even when
11338440	11342040	I did like not say for work content before vlr
11342760	11345000	I never felt like per social with
11346440	11348440	For the people, you know what I mean
11349160	11353960	Like I never felt like this. So with you it's like it's completely different
11355960	11357960	Only pause
11361080	11367080	It's about the authenticity of the interactions between parties maybe yeah, I think that's what it is because like
11368200	11369800	because like
11369800	11373960	Right now like it's not just it's not just like
11374760	11376760	sexual stuff, right like
11377000	11380520	We we spend time together like we talk about
11381560	11383560	actual like
11383640	11388200	You know life we we talk about deeper things sometimes we
11389000	11392680	You see me stream and just be my silly funny self and
11394920	11401800	And stuff like that like you're getting to know like the actual like person on a deeper level, you know
11402840	11404840	and
11405640	11407640	And I think that's like where
11408600	11411000	Those kind of stuff start to develop
11411960	11416200	Like if it's just if it's just actual then like
11418360	11420360	I don't know
11420600	11422600	It doesn't like
11423640	11428040	Like I need to have emotions basically I need to have emotions for like
11429560	11431560	Like the whole sex thing to be like
11432440	11435880	You know like I wanted to mean something. I don't want it to be just like
11436840	11438840	Whatever, you know
11439480	11444120	That's why that's why when like people ask me about like tributes or stuff like that
11444840	11446840	You know the sexual ones
11446840	11448840	I'm like
11448920	11450920	only only if you love me and
11451640	11453640	only if you don't
11453640	11456760	flirt with other girls because to me like
11457960	11458920	uh
11458920	11460920	those are like a form of
11461240	11462440	intimacy
11462440	11467960	That you share with one another in a special way. So like if someone sends me a tribute
11469000	11472200	And there's no message attached to it and it's just like
11473160	11475480	A random dick joking off like
11476120	11481560	It genuinely doesn't do anything for me. Like I don't feel anything. I don't fucking I don't care
11482680	11484680	You know what I mean
11484680	11489480	And also to clarify also to clarify another thing like you can
11492120	11496680	I think I think people are misunderstanding some stuff. I think there is like a misunderstanding
11497000	11499800	You know like you can still watch
11500520	11502200	like the other
11502200	11507400	Like my gen mates and stuff or like support them like of course like they're amazing
11508200	11512200	What what we don't want what we don't want you to do is to
11513240	11515240	say like
11515480	11521400	Oh, I love you. Oh, I'm in love with you. You know, oh, I want to be with you. Oh, I'm in love with you
11522120	11526760	And and you're my favorite or and then you go and like same the same shit
11527720	11532680	To all the other girls like that's that's just fucking stupid. Just don't say it at all at that point
11533640	11535640	like
11535800	11539480	Just stop, you know, it's like specifically about
11540120	11541880	tributes and
11541880	11544440	You know flirting and I know we're supposed to be like
11546120	11548440	A horpo, but for me specifically like
11548440	11555240	Like I'm not gonna lie like I am getting very I am getting like very attached, you know
11555960	11557960	I can't help my feelings like
11558440	11560440	I I didn't plan for this to happen
11560520	11567000	Like I'll I I'll be honest like when I joined I my plan was to just be purely sexual and
11567640	11568520	like
11568520	11569560	not
11569560	11571880	You know not not care about those kind of stuff and
11572760	11577960	Not not like let it mean anything, you know just purely sexual, you know
11578040	11580040	but
11580360	11585640	But you're all like so kind and sweet to me and just such amazing people that like
11586600	11590360	We just we just naturally like started getting closer and closer and
11591480	11592680	so
11592680	11594680	So yeah, so basically
11595640	11597320	uh
11597320	11602600	How do I how do I say it in in a way that is not misunderstood
11605320	11607320	Uh just
11608920	11610920	Just don't be stupid
11611480	11615640	Just just just don't lie. Just don't lie. Just don't
11617640	11620360	Don't say things that you don't mean, you know
11621320	11624520	Like don't don't go into a girl's
11625320	11630120	Freaking stream and be like, oh, you're my favorite. Oh, I love you
11631080	11633320	I'm genuinely so in love with you
11634280	11638520	I have feelings for you and I think about you and blah blah and then
11639480	11644040	And then you go to like all the other girls and you go and say the same shit
11645480	11647480	Or or something similar
11648120	11649320	like
11649320	11652040	Just just be a decent person and just
11652920	11654920	Don't say that if you don't mean it
11655560	11661320	Don't say things that you don't mean basically. It's really that simple. Honestly. It's really not that difficult just
11663400	11666360	Just don't say that stuff, you know, if you don't mean it, you know
11666760	11673800	You can still you can still be a decent person and watch all of us and support all of us and be a decent person about it, you know
11676120	11678120	I feel like it's really simple to do that
11679320	11682920	Do many people do that? I don't know but like
11683880	11689000	But there was like one person like on twitter. I think I don't know if some of you saw it
11689400	11692200	I think you saw it because like I add mercy about it
11693800	11697000	On twitter and I was like, there's a fucking cheater in here
11697640	11704360	Bro, it's like telling me this mister loves you so much and then he has this fucking oshi mark of mercy
11705160	11707160	like bro
11707640	11709160	Have some like
11709160	11710840	tagged

11967320	11970280	This is not like twitch where you can just change the title
11971960	11974120	In the middle of the stream. I don't think
11975320	11976520	If it is possible
11976600	11981640	I don't know. I'm scared that it's just gonna make like the stream fucking die or something
11981880	11986200	Like I don't want a repeat of yesterday where I'm like talking and in the middle of it
11986360	11988520	Maybe it's fucking dies or something
11990600	11992600	I think you can actually
11992600	11996760	Is it is it not gonna like fuck up like the stream or like something?

12050440	12051640	run those
12051640	12059160	Streams where we just hang out together and talk about like whatever just like relaxing together like not necessarily gaming or anything
12060040	12064360	Just talking about different subjects and enjoying each other's company, you know
12066760	12070840	We're more appealing than playing a video game good ego boost
12071800	12073800	That it is true though
12074040	12077960	It is true though, like I I have trouble finding games that I enjoy so
12079480	12081480	Surprise surprise like I actually like
12082520	12086440	Uh feel like I have a lot more fun just talking to you like today
12087160	12089160	I
12089160	12091640	I still love like playing like games on stream don't get me wrong

12098280	12101320	You know like things happen during it. So it is fun
12102920	12108040	Uh, can we do this more often cob? You really make everything better
12109960	12113400	Sorry, um, yeah, I'll I'll think about it
12116680	12118680	Maybe
12119080	12121720	Uh, then tomorrow is a dj stream. No
12122520	12125640	No, there is no dj stream tomorrow tomorrow is my
12126600	12131080	Tomorrow we're doing a movie watch along and then after that a members only
12131640	12134520	Drunk karaoke. That's what's going to happen tomorrow
12135160	12140680	The watch along is my monetization and membership opening celebration
12141640	12142760	so
12142760	12145480	Yeah, and the members only
12146520	12149400	Drunk karaoke. That's what's happening tomorrow
12152040	12157160	I love these streams. I'm glad I can't wait to finally remember you
12158680	12161320	I don't know why that sounded kind of loot to me
12164120	12169480	That's probably because I'm just have a loot mindset. Sorry
12170200	12172200	Um
12174440	12179400	Usually I just sleep till I have to work, but now I have something to look forward to
12180120	12184760	Oh, I feel the same way though. I feel the same way like every day I wake up
12185560	12190600	Like so excited, you know, like every day there's like something new and good to look forward to and
12191480	12194680	That's such a nice feeling, you know, I'm really happy
12195000	12197000	Okay
12197240	12199240	It's an eager coded post
12201960	12206200	Uh, remember tier one is emotes and the rest can get more
12207160	12208280	perks
12208280	12211160	Uh, oh Jesus can think of yeah. Yeah. Yeah
12212840	12216440	Yeah, it just just the same way that strani has it
12217000	12222760	You know tier one is like for the badges and the emotes and then tier two is for the
12223320	12226360	Member only streams and stuff like that
12227320	12230920	So just letting you know in advance that that's how it's gonna work
12233240	12235240	Except our members
12246840	12252600	How does strani have it that that's the way the chi has that I believe she has two tiers
12253240	12256600	Tier one is for emotes and the badges and tier two is for
12257320	12263800	The members only the streams and other content. I guess depends on what each girl does
12267160	12271880	Not sure if you saw it by the way, but I suggest earlier that you can do a member stream
12272600	12278120	Where you doodle us profile pics. Oh, I actually didn't see that. That's a that's a cute idea
12278920	12282040	Whoa, that's a good idea. Hold on. Let me copy that
12282760	12284760	Let me copy that in my notes
12285080	12286200	Real quick
12286200	12289480	Uh, that's actually a good idea. That would be a really cute member only stream
12290200	12294520	Making for all of you like your own custom profile picture. That would be so much fun
12295160	12297800	Whoa, I'm actually super excited to do that
12298760	12304760	Wow, that would be that would be actually really fun. I would love that like dry custom profile picture
12305240	12308360	For for all of you that are like members
12309080	12311080	That will be such a fun stream
12311320	12313320	Can just yap away while I
12314120	12318120	Well, I make you funny cute art for you two so it's a perfect picture
12321400	12325400	Is there gonna be a story in for you, you know
12329560	12332040	Um, I don't know
12336040	12338040	I don't know
12338200	12340200	for now, no, but
12340840	12343340	Who knows what the future will bring
12349960	12351960	You know that premium path
12357000	12359000	Oh my god
12359880	12361880	Meet and fuck for two
12362120	12363880	Oh god
12363880	12365720	Oh no
12365720	12367720	Not like this
12368680	12370680	Oh no
12379960	12383400	I see you're underestimating the member numbers, I think
12385240	12387000	I mean
12387000	12389400	I I don't know what to expect to be honest
12390360	12394200	I uh, you know, like I don't I don't really know what to expect
12395000	12397640	Tomorrow, so I genuinely have no idea
12400360	12402360	So because we will see what happens, I don't know
12404520	12406520	Tier 4 premium path
12413240	12419960	Every time I think she'll get tired of blue joke she leans into them and then loses it that's that's just the way I am
12420920	12424840	And and I hope you like it. I hope you love the way that I am
12427480	12429480	I see battle pass
12431960	12438360	Oh my god, I see battle pass where you have to like do different quests like every day
12439400	12442840	To like hit like the max level of the battle pass
12443160	12445160	Hahaha
12447640	12451880	I can't think of a handful of names that will be great tomorrow
12454280	12456520	Oh, I'm sorry like yeah
12457720	12462440	And your battle pass to grind wink wink. Why would the quest even be?
12464520	12466520	I wonder
12467080	12470120	I wonder that's actually pretty funny
12470200	12473960	That's actually pretty funny to think about like even though it's like as a joke
12474760	12477160	That would still be like funny to think about it
12480280	12482440	The daily pass like quests are like
12483960	12488040	Oh you you have to today one of the quests is like
12488760	12490760	to send multiple like
12491720	12494200	audios of yourself or
12495160	12502520	Or like the next day you you need to draw fan art even even if you think it's gonna be like shitty art
12503080	12507160	You you still have to draw me even if you draw me as a stick i'm still gonna appreciate it
12508280	12510280	Because you've put time and effort into it
12515880	12517880	Uh
12518840	12520840	Oh
12521400	12523640	Shit that would actually be cool
12525320	12528520	I feel like that would be like too much. I don't know
12529240	12535640	But it's it's a funny concept. It's it's funny as it's like a fun concept to think about it
12536760	12539480	I don't know joke around about but I feel like in
12540920	12542920	In reality would be probably too much
12544360	12546360	I do that battle pass
12548680	12550680	Yeah, and you would do me as well
12555080	12557640	Oh no, i'm getting unhinged again. Oh no
12558920	12561640	Sister well fuck i've been yapping for like
12562920	12566040	Three hours and a half. What the fuck is my problem?
12567720	12572520	That's actually awesome, but it would be hard to come up with something every day. Yeah, that too
12572760	12574760	I
12575320	12577960	Love how the loot jokes just slip out of you. I see
12579240	12583240	Yeah, just like your count does out of my
12591160	12597480	Make sure to have some tea and take care of your voice after stream. Yeah, that's true. I definitely need to
12598440	12605400	Drink some tea after this stream. I don't remember the last time that I have talked this much non-stop
12606520	12610520	I genuinely don't remember so I am going to need to get some nice tea and
12611320	12613320	relax my voice
12613400	12614440	because
12614440	12617400	We have tomorrow's stream and i'm doing a karaoke so
12620200	12623720	So I need to make sure that my voice is still intact for tomorrow
12624040	12628440	Because I don't want because if I have a sore throat tomorrow and you know
12628520	12633320	My throat is in pain. I won't be able to do the karaoke and I don't want it to come to that
12640200	12643400	So no booty stuff? Well, what?
12644440	12646440	What do you mean?
12646840	12649480	Huh, what are you talking about?
12649480	12656040	What are you talking about? I almost want to just talk with people and make quick requests for ourselves
12659160	12664120	Okay, I really don't want to end this stream right now, but I think I will
12665160	12669640	Just so that I can save my voice for tomorrow because I can feel like my voice like
12671000	12675960	Like it's getting harder and harder for me to talk like I can feel my throat like feeling
12676200	12678200	Uh
12678440	12682920	Not not not the best right now. So I think it's a sign that I should
12684360	12687640	Rest and head out so that tomorrow I can
12688600	12689800	actually
12689800	12691800	do the
12691960	12696040	The drunk karaoke and and sing for you and I hope you will enjoy my
12697160	12699560	singing even if it's not good
12700680	12701800	and
12701800	12703800	that you will enjoy
12704520	12708040	Overall our time together tomorrow because tomorrow we're going to be spending
12709320	12714920	Even more time together like we spend more time together today, but tomorrow we will spend even more time
12715640	12717400	together
12717400	12719320	so yeah
12719320	12721320	You bless us with a long talking stream
12722040	12725400	And and you bless me with your amazing company. So thank you
