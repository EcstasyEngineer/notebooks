You can see if it's going well today's video, see you in the next video!
Thank you for watching, bye!
Hello, my sweet and lovely Snow Berries.
Hello, hello, hello.
I hope you're doing well today.
And if for some reason you're not doing all that great, that's okay.
That's what I mean if what.
I missed you.
It's really good to see all of you here.
Thank you for always keeping me company.
That's very sweet.
I'm glad the feeling is mutual.
I just wanted to say in advance that last stream I had my big window closed.
And today I have it open so that it won't get too hard, too hot.
I can't talk.
So it won't get too hot in my room.
However, with that being said, if it's too loud or too distracting,
please tell me I want to get upset and I will close the big window.
Because you can literally sometimes hear people walking outside.
It's crazy.
This microphone literally picks up everything.
So please do tell me if it ever gets too loud or too annoying.
Because I want the ASMR to be as comfy as it can be.
Yeah.
Also, I saw a comment on my last ASMR thought that
they don't know if I do this intentionally or not.
That I usually focus a lot on one ear and if it was intentional.
So the answer is no, it's not intentional.
I generally just forget to switch between the ears.
So if you ever feel that I talk for too long in one ear,
don't hesitate to remind me to switch between them.
So that I can make the experience better for you.
Okay.
You have all been so kind and sweet to me.
It's been really overwhelming, but not in a bad way.
Like in a good way, but still overwhelming.
So it's something that I'll have to get used to.
I guess it's very new to me.
But I don't want to say that I appreciate it so much.
You've all been so sweet and kind to me.
And there's really not enough words to express.
Just, I don't know, just so much.
I appreciate it.
Thank you. You're being all just too kind to me.
I don't know what I did to deserve such nice treatment from you, but
I'm glad that you think I'm worth it either way.
Lots of emotions for a little cutie.
Yeah, I feel my emotions very strongly.
So I apologize if sometimes the things I say sound weird,
or we're like, I'm yapping too much.
I feel like I've been yapping way too much today.
But at the same time, just I can help it.
I really want you all to know just how much it means to me.
But if you like, no matter how many things I write or say,
it's never going to really be enough to truly describe how I feel about all of this.
Thank you.
I did love you, Ozzy. Good job, yapping too much.
Thank you. How's it going, sir?
I brought some, you stopped today, some additional triggers that I think
could sound potentially good for today's stream.
So one of the things that I brought is a cat toy that I have,
and it makes some really, really nice crinkly sounds.
And I really enjoy sounds like that, so I thought,
well, how did I not think about last stream?
Let's make some nice sounds with it.
Here.
Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.
Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.
You have a cat. I have two cats.
Yeah, I have two cats.
Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.
Crinkle.
Crinkle.
Crinkle.
Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.
What are your cat's names if you don't mind me asking?
One of them is Bucklush.
And the second one is Potato.
Bucklush has been really whiny and needy today.
Like, I initially closed the door and he was like
moving with his paws and like whining and stuff.
But he's okay now.
He's just super whiny.
So I don't want him to be super loud and whiny in your ears.
He's a very good boy.
But really whiny and vocal, but super cute.
And Potato is really tiny and she is this cute funny little gremlin.
They're both really cute gremlins. I love them both.
This toy also has a soft texture on top of it.
So when I move it against your ears like this,
it can cause fun. It feels soft against the ear.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
oh

You deserve the kisses in the world for being so sweet.
Where is the ASMR stream yet?
I'm so fucking sorry.
I feel so bad. I feel so mad. I'm so sorry.
I hope my kisses can make up for it.
I hope my kisses can make up for it.
I hope my kisses can make up for it.

I love you
I love you very much rocket to success  Bayern
I love you so much, I love you so much.
I love you so much, I love you so much.
I love you so much, I love you so much.
That's how Mr. makes me feel. Mr. makes my heart go tucky-tucky-tucky.
That's how Mr. makes me feel.
How are these days, by the way? Are you doing fine?
I'm doing more than fine, I'm doing amazing, to be honest.
It's been just one week, but it was the best week ever.
I don't know, it's been so crazy, but every day has been genuinely just so great.
I'm sorry, I apologize.
I'm sorry.
I remember how nervous you were before the video.
Yeah, I was extremely nervous.
When I was done with the video, I was legitimately shaking.
My whole body was buzzing and shaking.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here, I'm glad to be here.
I'm very happy to be here, and I feel very lucky.
I feel very lucky too.
I feel so lucky that it's only been a weekend.
I already have so many nice and kind people here with me.
I don't know, it feels so real, it feels like a dream.
But it's a dream that became a reality.
It's like that one meme that I saw before I joined the L.R.
And it was like, a girl wakes up one day and realizes she's living her dream.
And that's how I feel, I wake up and I'm like, wow, my dream is amazing.
My reality, that's so magical, you know.
I think it's just so cool.
Let me play around with some other triggers.
It's like a bunch of paper strings or something like that.
So I thought maybe I could try making some sounds with it.
Rather variety.
Some of them are falling out of my hand.
That's probably gonna make a mess, but it's okay.
As long as it makes nice sounds.
Hopefully it does.
I love it when you say mister.
It can help that my mister's are so kind to me and so loving.
Love you mister.
Yeah, this is one of the new triggers, yeah, it is.
Sometimes I feel self-conscious about being older, but you still like me.
Of course I like you, what do you mean?
What do you mean, of course?
And I mean, being older is not a bad thing, I think.
I think that's a nice thing, if anything.
I think being older does add to it in some ways.
But I think it's also about the way your soul is.
Your age could be maybe not older or anything, but you have an old soul, if that makes sense.
So in either scenario, it works.
I love all my mister's.
Okay.
As for the tip that you just mentioned that I missed,
I always read any donations or tips at the end of every stream.
So I will do that towards the end of the stream, don't worry.
I love you mister.
If the spring's a love for me, then I'm gonna put them back for now.
Nice spring's everywhere.
Thank you.
Let me see my comfort rate.
I'm not in the next comfort right now.
Those cables are everywhere.
They have two stones or minerals, whatever you wanna call them.
I thought that they would make for nice sounds.
One of them is blue and the other one is green.
I don't remember what their names are.
I'm too down to remember.
My memory is pretty bad.
But I hope you will like the sounds that they make together.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Do you really make me crave for cuddles that way?
Here I'm gonna get some hugs and cuddles today.
Just like last week.
Sorry for muting.
My throat felt scratchy and I had to cough.
No worries, I'm not sick.
My throat just felt itchy or scratchy for some reason.
So I had to cough it up basically.
I'm glad you do.
Don't hesitate to ask for previous triggers that I have already done during this stream.
If you want to hear more of them, that's completely fine.
Thank you very much.
Can I bring back the tippy tabs?
Yes, we can definitely do that.

我 God アンケ edition of01!
Can I get a verse again?
I don't blame you, this has been me, like every day, like I feel butterflies somewhat lately with just how loving and sweet mister is to me, I admit sometimes there's moments where like even one
to maybe call you Dada or you know other stuff but I guess really embarrassed about it and shy and I also don't want to make it weird so for now I just stick to ojizan and mister and you know snow pairing but sometimes I have like I just do all you boy other stuff too but
I hold myself back because I get really shy and embarrassed so maybe at some point I will but I'm really embarrassed right now
for now it's gonna be like this but I just wanted to tell you about it just to you know let it out and tell you how I felt
is there any pet names you like, like cutie or kitten or darling?
I really like just having the word little at it so let me like little icy, it's cute
I think it's cute doesn't it?
just um
oh god
I feel that's like one of my big favorites, darling is good as well, darling is cute too
or baby icy
I don't know why I just embarrassed about it but I'm like all blushing right now
icy little boys, it's really cute
it's really cute
you're my baby darling
that's really cute
so I'm getting really flustered
I have a small box here and it has something in it but
but I don't know if I should do anything about it
but it's really cute
I have a small box here and it has something in it
but
but I don't know if I should do any like triggers or anything with it
I feel embarrassed
but can you guess what it is?
what's in the box?
what's in the box?
is it toy?
not necessarily no, I wouldn't really say it's a toy no
yes, a best find
how did you know?
how did you know what the egg?
it has a really cute pacifier that one of my masters got me from the farm
so I've been wondering if I should use it as a striker or something like that
but I don't know if that would be like really weird or if it's, I don't know
I just feel really shy the best
ah
I already said no, I'm sorry
but I'm shy
I really am embarrassed
I don't know
I don't know
it would be funny if I have the best seat and I try to talk
I think that would be funny
without opening it
it's not a way to make it weird
but I'm sorry ok, I'm really embarrassed
I don't know, I'm so embarrassed
I don't know
oh, it's so cute though
it's so cute though
it has a moon and a polar bear with a heart and ribbons
and it is cute on it
and it has like a candy
like stuff and like
like lots of like shiny sparkly things on it
and it's really really cute
I really love the way that it looks, it's so freaking cute
ah
I'm kinda wondering if I could maybe
actually like take a picture of it
and then cut it out
and use it like as an on-stream asset
basically have it used on my model as well
I think that would be really cute
and more immersive maybe
I don't know
like a toggle, yeah, something like that
one

I'm trying to remember what other triggers I did last time.
But my memory is so bad.
I didn't know that I can remember if there was more stuff that I did last time.
I don't know if I remember what other triggers I did last time.
But I don't know if I remember what other triggers I did last time.
I don't know if I remember what other triggers I did last time.
But yeah, that's true. I was tapping the microphone yesterday.
Not yesterday, but last time somewhere strange.
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

I was tapping the microphone yesterday.
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.
I remember when I heard this trigger for the first time that someone was scratching against the radio mic.
I felt so many details. It was crazy.
It really sucks how rarely I get tingles now.
In the first year or two that I got into ASMR, I got tingles so often and so much of it.
But it's really rare now.
Can I try saying coconut?
Okay.
Coconut.
Coconut.
Coconut.
Yeah, you just said that the sun is nice.
Yeah, it's sad really.
I still get tingles here and there but it's rare and it makes me sad.
Because it feels so nice.
Oh, I know. Maybe this will make a good sound. It's like a sticker.
Oh, I know. Maybe this will make a good sound. It's like a sticker.
Or maybe not. Maybe I'm just stupid.
I don't know if that sounds good or not. I can't tell.
It's so cute with these tumbles over her words.
It's almost just really hard for her to say no.
Okay, how are we feeling about this sticker trigger?
Is it any good? Or is it like, man, whatever?
It's like, man, I wish it was more sticky.
Maybe mister can help me make this sticker more sticky.
What about this sound?
Is this any good?
I don't know where it pleases you but I want to please mister. That's important.
Maybe with some kind of tape.
There are bits to gear. I would try that.
Okay, let's start with the other ear.
I don't know if I can see them better.
We are not decent anymore, mister. You're both.
It just depends on what I feel like calling you in the moment.
That's really weird. I feel like this sticker doesn't really stick much in this ear.
Because it sounded a lot better in the other ear. More sticky.
I think it is a spaghetti. Spaghetti. Spaghetti.
I don't think I feel safe putting this sticker anywhere near my skin if you know what I mean.
Okay, let's start with the other ear.
Okay, let's start with the other ear.
Okay, let's start with the other ear.

I love you.
I had bubble wrap like a few weeks ago, but I don't have it anymore.
But I promise whenever I do get bubble wrap in any of my packages, I'll be sure to save it and use it as a trigger for my ASMR streams.
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
I'm going to do a little bit of sniffing since I did the last stream as well.
Sniffing.
What is sniffing so happily? You, of course, silly.
Sniffing.
The smell of a snow fairy. My favorite.
You stink very nice.
My favorite smell.
Sniffing.
Sniffing.
Sniffing.
Sniffing.
Sniffing.
Sniffing.
Sniffing.
Sniffing.
Sniffing.
Sniffing.
Let me give you a hug. I think you deserve a nice warm hug. Come here.
Come here, my beloved. You deserve some nice nice hugs to get you feel relaxed and loved and nice.
Sniffing.
I love you, snow fairy. So, so much.
You deserve all the hugs in the world. You deserve to get some nice warm cuddles after a hard day of work.
Snow fairy has been working so hard for me. It's so sweet, aren't you? The sweetest in the world. I love you so, so much.
I love you.
It feels nice cuddling you like this. So nice and comfy.
Wishing I could clone herself like she tweeted so I could have icy hugs for real. We all need an icy. I feel the same.
It makes me sad when I think about it too deeply. I try not to overthink it, but I don't know. I gotta help with it today.
And I just felt like really sad and was like, man, if I could clone myself for this reason, I would.
Would you cuddle with your clone self? No, that would be weird.
Would you make us happy if that's all that matters? Yeah, but I want to make you even happier, you know?
And I think about it like, I still feel like I want to be able to make you happier, but like I also, I don't know, just makes me a little sad, I guess.
But I should stop thinking about it and enjoy what we have.
That question would you cuddle with your model if it was real?
I don't know how to answer this question because my model is me, you know? Like I see is me and I am icy, you know?
So, I don't even know how to answer this question because it's literally me. It's literally me, so like, I don't know how to answer it.
I think we already are happy. Then offer to yourself for a sake, okay? I'll try. I'll try.
I'll offer my best to you to make you as happy as I can within my ability.
Have you enjoyed that nice cuddle we had? I know I did.
Let's stay out with you, Rocky, during the stream. I mean, then do you...
As always. Like I said, during summer, when it's hot, I just wear panties. That's it.
What color?
I posted it on my old Twitter, actually. A picture of the panties. I posted it on my old Twitter.
Some of you probably have seen it. Nothing else. Yeah, nothing else.
I feel like that's normal for me, anyways. Like, it's summer, but while they wear anything else, I'm in my own space, I'm not outside or anything.
I'm not gonna get a cold, the weather is hot.
I don't wear socks around. I wear slippers. Have, like, really cute reindeer slippers that I wear around the house. They very soft and comfy to wear.
Let me know what you think of this sound. Is it any good or not?
Yeah, it's good.
I feel like I really need some time to establish myself and get into the growth of things, especially now that I'm overwhelmed with all the support and attention I've been getting in the future.
Maybe, I don't know, it might happen if it depends how I feel a while from now.
Can we get some cows later? Yeah, yeah, of course, definitely.
I don't feel pressured to do anything you're not ready for. Yeah, thank you for understanding. I definitely only want to do stuff that I feel comfortable doing.
But, you know, it doesn't mean it will never happen. Like, there's always the possibility that something's gonna happen. You live and you see what happens.
Wait, Ben, there's only no bra. I don't need a bra.
I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra.
I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra.
As I plan to be an ASMR tomorrow as well or on Thursday tomorrow, there will be another ASMR stream tomorrow as well. Back to back.
ASMR. Thank you.
I just sleep in bed naked. No, not fully naked. Just with my panties.
But yeah, I feel like ASMR streams are definitely very nice for the days where I don't really feel like playing anything, you know?
And I just want to in bed and just relax together with you and just be comfy together, comfy quality. I can't talk. Comfy, quality time together.
I see do you play any instruments? No, I don't. I used to have a kalimba, a small one.
And I used to use a Disney smart trigger and play it sometimes, but I never played any actual songs or anything like that.
I just randomly pressed it in whatever sounded good to me, I guess. I freestyled the kalimba because that's how I enjoyed doing it the most.
What's your favorite ASMR trigger? I actually really love visual ASMR triggers, so I really enjoy triggers where there's like hand movements or bright lights and stuff like that.
Combined with whispers, there's something really calming about it. I just used to play piano. Oh, that's so cool. That's really nice.
That makes me think of a memory that I have. I remember when I was a little younger, I had a friend and me and her would sometimes go to the mall together.
And the mall had this big piano store. And in the piano store, they had actually headphones plugged into the piano so you could sit and play it.
And obviously, I don't know how to play the piano, but I would sometimes go to that store, sit and just make up my own melodies for like a while.
Sometimes I would sit there for like 20 minutes or something because it was just like a really fun thing to do.
Sculpt massage is 10 out of 10. Actually, I think I might be able to do a sculpt massage. I have a wig, so I think if I put the wig on the 3DO and I scratched the top of it, maybe it would feel or sound like head scratches.
I would say I hope so.
Maybe you just will have to pick a piano again, learn a song for you.
Oh, that's so sweet. That's really sweet.
I don't know why it makes me want to peer up, but I think that's really sweet. Thank you.
Can you try hair brushing with it, too? It's such a very trigger brush, so comfy.
Do you mean like get a hair brush and brush the wig hair? Is that what you mean?
Because yeah, definitely something that I would do. I think that would be really nice.
Let's see. I have some scissors here. I want to see if it would make for good sounds. So let me know what you think.
Snip, snip, snip, snip. Don't worry. I'm always snipping away the dead ends, so your hair...
Fuck, I can't talk because that's so stupid. So your hair can grow healthy.
Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip.
You know what else I like to do? Sometimes I like to use scissors for ASMR, but not for hair cutting.
For cutting away negative energy. So if snowberries are feeling a bit down or tired, I'm going to snip it all away, and you're going to feel much better after it.
I know it sounds kind of silly, but I like to think of it that way sometimes.
Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip.
Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip.
Lemonade audio for your decent. I mean, yeah, I could, but I guess my thought pattern about it is like, well, I've already made two of them,
so I feel like if I make a third one, then it's boring.
Like, I don't know what would make it better.
I don't want to just upload a bunch of lemonade sounds every day because I mean, that's just going to be boring.
I think I'm going to get cat noises, meow somewhere, meow.
Wait, you did too? Yeah, I did too. If you go through my media, you will find the second one or just scroll down.
It's not boring, just boost up what you're doing at the time, doing a random stream.
Maybe, maybe I'll do that. Maybe I'll do that.
Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snipe, snip
Snipe, snipe, snipe, snipe, snip, snip, snipe, snip, snip, snip
All right, someone asked if I can do some yawing or yaw sounds.
yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, y
yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw,

Because I feel bad if when I raid, if there's people that are asleep, or are really comfy, will get like jump scared, and I don't want that, and I did raid Stranny last days in my stream, but I don't know how.
How you feel? I guess I feel bad for the people that might get jump scared, cause I don't know.
I don't know. I'll try to duck louder towards the end of the stream, like last ASMR stream.
What is Mano raid? I don't know what that is. Oh no, it's people talking outside.
Sorry, people talking outside.
I don't know. I would feel like too shy to raid anyone else. That's not my gen mates, so there's bad too.
I mostly just keep to myself, and I'm only more comfy around my gen mates.
But I will talk a bit louder, or let no one advance towards the end of the stream like I did.
Anyways, let me drink some water.
I'm too shy for that. I'm really bad with initiating with the people.
And even with my gen mates, a lot of times I don't initiate conversations. Just how my brain is, I guess.
I say can you try finger flattering? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's do some finger flattering.
What the fuck is that question? What? What is the power of something so what?
I'm sorry, but I have literally no idea what that question means. I literally do not understand what.
I don't know what this word means either.
I'm sorry, I don't know. I have no idea what this is. I've never seen that meme, so I don't know.
The biology meme? Well, I'm just stupid, so you can't give me memes about any science or biology or any of that, because I'm just a baby.
I'm just a little baby. I don't know what any of that stuff.
The only biology you need to know is what it is that you just see personally.
True, that all that really matters, I agree.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, because I have a death in my mouth. That's why I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

Someone said I sound like a nerd.
I know it's your way.
Snow bears would hate me now because it sounds like a nerd.
When I have my passion, you aren't the one.
I want to sound cute, but if I don't sound cute,
when I use the pacifier, I won't use it.
Snow bears would hate me now because it sounds like a nerd.

Just don't worry.

I'm the only baby here.

No.
I'm the only kid.
I wouldn't want kids.
When I'm the kid.
I want all these things to give all the attention to me forever.
All attention on me.
And me only.
Mm-hmm.
It's the best thing to do.
That's what I am.

And the time you're here with me, I enjoy the stream.
But more important, I hope that you enjoyed the stream as well.
I'm sorry if it wasn't as good as the first ASMR stream.
Okay, so I'm gonna talk a little louder so that you can wakey-wakey.
Wakey-wakey is not very...
Wakey-wakey is not very...
I'm gonna miss you, Snow Berries.
I'm gonna miss you, Snow Berries.
But it's okay, cause tomorrow...
Cause tomorrow I will be doing another stream, another ASMR stream.
So it's okay, I will do more ASMR tomorrow.
But I am gonna miss you, and I am gonna think of you.
Like, I always do.
But yeah, Snow Berries, try to wake up.
Because I'm gonna be waiting strongy.
I miss you, I see you.
I'm gonna miss you too.
I'm gonna miss all of you.
We'll meet again tomorrow again, for more ASMR.
Okay, I promise.
I love you, Snow Berries.
I love you now, be thinking of you.
Okay, you're always on my mind, 24-7.
I love you, Snow Berries.
Okay, thank you again for being here.
I'll see you again tomorrow, okay?
Bye-bye, Sonyeo.
I love you.
Bye-bye, bye-bye.
