04:26.000 --> 04:55.000
Hello everyone! How are you guys doing? Hello! Hello to all the Snow Berries! Welcome! Welcome! Hi!

04:56.000 --> 05:16.000
Okay, can I just be honest, like, even though it's past debut, I'm still feeling pretty nervous right now, so I'm sorry in advance if I'm still going to be a bit awkward and stuff.

05:17.000 --> 05:32.000
It will take me a few streams to kind of get the hold of stuff and, you know, get completely fully comfy, so I hope that's understandable with you guys.

05:32.000 --> 05:58.000
But thank you so much for showing to my 2.0 debut stream. For those who don't know what a 2.0 stream basically, most debuts these days usually don't have enough time for you to really introduce yourself fully.

05:58.000 --> 06:19.000
Actually, we have limited time and yeah, I only had 30 minutes and well, everyone did. Sorry, I don't know why but I'm so nervous. I'm so nervous. I don't know, I'm so nervous.

06:20.000 --> 06:36.000
I feel like I'm even more nervous than during the debut, honestly. I don't know why. I think it's because now that the debut is over, I'm like, I can actually read the chat and see what you guys are saying.

06:37.000 --> 06:51.000
So it's like trying to read everything and trying to like settle in and stuff, so I'm sorry if I'm even more awkward than I was yesterday.

06:52.000 --> 07:00.000
Maybe you should chill out. You know, maybe I should. Maybe I should try doing that.

07:00.000 --> 07:15.000
I'll ban anyone trying to be mean. Oh, Amy, you're so sweet. Thank you. Yeah, be careful. Amy is here. She has lots of tricks up her sleeve because of her magic book, so make sure you behave.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
Alright, there's...

07:21.000 --> 07:36.000
There's just so many things to talk about that I don't even know where to even begin. Like, I'll be honest. I feel like I...

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
Okay, so there were two slides yesterday that I didn't show during my debut because I didn't have time for them.

07:43.000 --> 07:59.000
And one of them was actually my interest on hobbies. To be honest, I have more interests than what's shown on the slide, but I can't think of them right now because I'm feeling pretty brain dead.

08:00.000 --> 08:12.000
I took a nap before the stream. I was just so sleepy. I woke up kind of early, but it wasn't enough. I went to sleep around...

08:13.000 --> 08:28.000
I think I went to sleep around 1 or 2 a.m. yesterday, so I was really, really tired. Very, very sleepy. I was so out of it.

08:29.000 --> 08:39.000
That's why I was also wheezing non-stop at the group collab because my brain just dies when I get extremely sleepy.

08:39.000 --> 08:53.000
And I just start being extra dumb and silly, and it just results in me sometimes just laughing for no reason.

08:54.000 --> 09:03.000
Do you have a brain freeze? I do, actually. So if I go non-verbal or I go...

09:06.000 --> 09:17.000
That's why. Because I am still nervous and I'm still kind of like... I need to shake off all those feelings.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
The wheezes were cute. Thank you. I'm glad you think so.

09:24.000 --> 09:36.000
I was scared. I didn't want to be rude because Strani was talking and then Azora was going to talk about her stuff.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
And I tried so hard not to laugh. And my body just kept laughing and laughing.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
And I could not stop. It was so hard to physically stop my body from laughing.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
And I just couldn't. So it was wrong.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
How are you, Cobb? I'm doing pretty good.

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
I feel like I need to take a deep breath and slowly relax.

10:05.000 --> 10:15.000
I feel like every time I talk right now, I'm overthinking every single thing that I'm saying right now to the point where I'm saying something.

10:15.000 --> 10:22.000
And at the same time in my brain, I'm like, oh no, what the fuck are you saying? Oh no, you sound so stupid.

10:22.000 --> 10:28.000
Oh no, shut up. Oh no, this and that. And I'm trying so hard to make my brain stop.

10:28.000 --> 10:36.000
I'm really overwhelmed. So it will take me a few strings before I can get the groove of things.

10:36.000 --> 10:45.000
So I apologize in advance if I'm really all over the place.

10:45.000 --> 10:52.000
No, I sound so cute right now. Thank you, Yumi. I appreciate it.

10:53.000 --> 11:00.000
Okay, well, I guess let's get started. Before we get started though.

11:00.000 --> 11:08.000
On yesterday's debut, I realized that I didn't really show off my full body.

11:08.000 --> 11:15.000
So I'm kind of wondering if I should do that right now. Would you guys like me to start with that?

11:15.000 --> 11:23.000
Because I feel like I zoomed in on my face, but I didn't really show my full body.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
So I don't know if that's something you're interested in seeing.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
Okay, okay, okay. Hold on, let me put myself in front.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Let me put myself over here.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Oh no, what the hell.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
Why am I rotated like this? No.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
No, why am I rotated like this? No.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
I'm trying to... Oh fuck.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
Okay, well, at least this is not the debut stream, so whatever.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Oh wow.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Oh wow.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
Okay, so this is... Let me stand up on the desk.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
So this is what my full body looks like.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
And I actually didn't show you guys yesterday,

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
but I can actually take off my shoes as well.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
I can take my shoes off. Yay.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
I was thinking, you know, we are literally in my room right now,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
and we're all hanging out together.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
So why would I wear shoes inside my own house, you know?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
So I might just take them off.

13:07.000 --> 13:16.000
Here, have a nice once in a lifetime experience for my feet.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
I don't have any nail polish or anything like that on my feet.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
I'm just a polar bear.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I don't care about the stuff.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
However, if you want to do it for me and you're more than welcome,

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
that will make it a lot easier on me.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
If you want to put nail polish on me, that's fine by me.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
And let's zoom in into some other parts.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
I know you didn't even get to see my paws, but now you can.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
So this is my really nice, juicy size.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
And you can see my paws also.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
You didn't really get to see that yesterday,

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
besides when I was showing the slides and stuff,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
but now you can.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
I'll try to do some streams where I show more of my body

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
so that you can actually see my paws and stuff like that

14:16.000 --> 14:22.000
whenever I'm gaming and stuff like that.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
Also, speaking of paws,

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
I want to do sometimes paw cam streams.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
I think that would be pretty funny to see how clumsy I get

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
when I try to do things.

14:37.000 --> 14:47.000
Maybe do some paw streams where I try snacks

14:47.000 --> 14:53.000
or maybe paw streams where I write something cute for you

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
or decorate stuff.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I don't know.

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
My brain is kind of all over the place right now, but...

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
But yeah.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
Let me get back in my chair.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Mm-hmm.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Whoops.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Okay.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Okay, that's better.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
That's better.

15:31.000 --> 15:37.000
I just noticed her belt is a seat belt from a crashed vehicle.

15:38.000 --> 15:45.000
I wouldn't really say a vehicle more from...

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
If you saw the lore from...

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Fuck, I can't talk.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
From the plane that crashed.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Also, another thing, I don't know if you guys noticed,

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
but my necklace is made of teeth.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
And I don't know if you know,

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
but those teeth that I have on my necklace

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
are actually the teeth from the big beast

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
in the lore video that I have defeated.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
And basically what happened is

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
after that big event happened,

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
I took the teeth from that beast,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I made them into a necklace

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
and I put them around my neck

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
as a reminder for myself

16:38.000 --> 16:44.000
that I can defeat the scariest of things

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
and no matter how scared I can get,

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
if I can defeat something as scary and big as that beast,

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
I can defeat anything that scares me

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
and push through it.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
That's kind of the deeper meaning

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
that this necklace of teeth has for me

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
and I've been wearing it ever since then.

17:12.000 --> 17:18.000
Helps remind myself when I'm scared of stuff.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Kind of like yesterday.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
I was so nervous yesterday.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I was literally shaking.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
My hands were shaking.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
I was trying my best

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
not to ever look at the chat

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
and just pretend that I was doing another mock stream.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
And I was just like...

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Let's go through this.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Let's do as best as we can

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
and just get this over with.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Honestly, it's really nerve-wracking to go first,

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
but at the same time it was nice

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
when I was done,

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
when I was finally done with my debut,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
it was really nice to be able to just sit back

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
and relax and watch all my other genmates debut

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
and eat nice dinner while they're doing their debuts.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
I'm honestly so proud of all of my genmates.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
They're amazing.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
Everyone is so talented.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Whenever we were doing the mock streams and stuff,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I was like...

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Honestly, I was scared.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
I don't know if scared is the right word,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
but I was worried.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I think worried maybe is...

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
Hold on, let me sit in a more comfy way.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Sorry.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
I'm trying to adjust my stuff

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
and sit in a more comfy position.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
But yeah, so...

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
When we were doing the mock streams

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
and I saw all the mocks of my genmates and stuff,

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
I was worried.

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
I was worried because they're all so talented.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
They all have such good ideas

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
and everything that I was really worried.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
I was like, oh no, I go first

19:27.000 --> 19:33.000
and I'm gonna have the most boring and shitty debut.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
So I was making me really worried

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
and stuff like that.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
They're all so sweet and kind to me

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
and reassured me that it is good

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
and that everything is going to be okay.

19:53.000 --> 19:58.000
There's really...

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
There's really not enough words for me to describe

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
just how amazing these girls are.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
They're all so sweet, so supportive.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
Also talented.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I really love them

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
and I appreciate any time

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
that they have helped me

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
or gave me courage

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
or gave me reassurance whenever.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I second yes myself

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
but get really insecure

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
and stuff like that.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
But debuts are extremely nerve wracking.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
They definitely are

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
because it's supposed to be this big day

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
where you want to make a good impression

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
and you want to do the best that you can.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
I tried my best.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
I tried to do the best with what I have

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
and I hope that it was at least good enough

21:01.000 --> 21:09.000
or okay to be enjoyable to watch.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Sorry I keep taking deep breaths.

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
I talk so much that I forget to breathe in the middle.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
So that's why I take deep breaths

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
because I'm talking so much that

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
I forget to breathe in the middle.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Oh my God.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
It was enjoyable.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Thank you.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
I'm really glad to hear that.

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
There's going to be a lot of yapping today

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
and I hope that's okay with you.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
There's...

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Breathe pokey.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Okay Amy.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
I'm gonna do breathing exercises with Amy.

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
She's gonna do a guided meditation for me.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
Oh my God.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Alright.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
So I wanted to go over some of the slides

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
and some stuff that I didn't have.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
That I didn't have with my slides yesterday.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
So as you can already see

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
the slide has been here for like the best

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
22 minutes of me just yapping

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
interesting hobbies.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
So DJ.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
As you already probably know from yesterday

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
I enjoy DJing.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
I'm still very amateur.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
I'm still learning.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
But when I tried it for the first time

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I just completely fell in love with it.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
It was just so fun.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I was like oh my God.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Listening to good music

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
and do stuff during and after it.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
Especially doing transitions between songs.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
It's just fun for me.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
I don't know how to explain it.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I think sometimes it's one of those things

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
where you have to try it for yourself

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
and then you just end up really liking it.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
The DJ part was really damn good.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Aw, thank you.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Thank you.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
I'm really glad.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
What made you want to start DJing?

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
So actually what made me start

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
want to try DJing

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
is honestly watching other DJ streamers.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
I would a lot of times

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
just watch the DJs

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
and some of them had such good vibes.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
They would have so much energy.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
They would have all the pretty lights.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
They would play really good music.

24:04.000 --> 24:10.000
They would interact with their viewers as well.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
I was like that is just so much fun.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
You get to play cool music.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
You get to just party and go crazy.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
And you also get to talk to your viewers

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
and basically feel in a way like you're partying with them.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
And stuff like that.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
So for me it was like the more I watched other DJ streamers

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
the more I was like wow.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
I really want to try to do that.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
I want to see if I like it

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
and maybe do DJ streams sometime in the future

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
and I started getting more and more into it

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
and now it's going to be one of those stuff

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
that I would like to do at least once a week.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
If not once a week

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
then once every other week and that makes sense.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I don't know. It depends.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
I guess it depends on how I'm feeling that week

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
because you don't need to have a lot of energy

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
and be super hype and stuff.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
If you DJ you can't really be like

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
oh hi guys.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Yeah let's DJ.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
And then I turn on the music

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
and I'm not talking the entire time

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
and I'm not interacting with any of you.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Like you know what I mean?

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
That would be just so boring.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
At that point why even DJ?

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
At that point why even DJ?

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
I also saw

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Emi

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
write 3D rave with ICS the DJ please

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
and actually that is

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
that is actually one of my goals

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
one of my biggest goals

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
is to one day when we have

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
3D models

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
is to hopefully

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I don't know how possible that would be

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
but I say don't let your dreams

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
stay dreams you know

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
make them a reality

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
and one of my biggest dreams and goals

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
being here in BLR is

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
once we have 3D models

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
to eventually have this really really huge event

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
where we will have like IRL venue

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
where you could come into that venue

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
and buy tickets

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
and see me and all the other girls

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
in 3D interact with you

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
while I DJ

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
while we all party together

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
and you will be able to also watch it

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
live online as well

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
as it happens

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
that is my biggest dream

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
it would just be so cool you know

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
I just think it would be so cool

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
because right now

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
there is like 3D VTuber concerts and stuff

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
but I haven't seen anyone do yet

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
like a cool party

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
with like a DJ

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
and dancing

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
and like that kind of interaction

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
and I don't know just

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
something that

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
that's one of my big dreams

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
I think it would be extremely fun

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
also whenever I get 3D in general

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
there's just so many things that I want to do

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
I want to do dancing streams

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
because I like to dance

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
not professionally

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
not professionally or anything

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
I just enjoy dancing it's fun

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
so when I have 3D I would like to do some streams

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
where I just dance to like different songs

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
or DJ in like a 3D like place

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
and explore different worlds

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
and I just think

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
I just think there's so many things

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
that you can do when you are 3D you know

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
like generally there's

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
the options are limitless

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
another thing that I would like to do

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
another idea that I had

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
is we would have like a 3D summer event

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
when me and all my gen mates

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
we would all be in 3D

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
but it would be like a summer event

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
so I would play a lot of house music

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
for that you know summer vibe

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
and we would be at like a 3D area

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
that would have like a pool

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
and look like all exotic and summery

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
while I play some music

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
and we are all in swimsuits

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
or bikinis

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
and we interact with you

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
and we party and we have fun

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
really another thing that I would

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
I would really really love to do like

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
a 3D pool party

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
with music

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
so I can't believe how much I've been yapping already

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I need to remember to breathe

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
ok so

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
honestly I don't know

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
if I even need to go over it

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
like I wrote napping but like

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
who cares

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
like why did I think it's a good idea to

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
to write that like

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
ok and

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
you like napping I mean ok

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
what about

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
who cares

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I don't know I'm stupid

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
I was really overwhelmed

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
but yeah I like taking naps

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
and usually I like to take naps before stream

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
so that I can wake up feeling more energized

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
oh my god

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
we enjoy the yap don't worry

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
thank you I'm glad to hear that

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
where's your favorite place to nap

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
I mean the bed obviously

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
I also

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
like to cook sometimes

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I need to be in the right

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
mood for it most of the time though

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
I'll be honest most of the time I'm not in the mood for cooking

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
but when I am I can make some

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
pretty good stuff

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
yesterday I made

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
rice with chicken curry

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
and it was so yummy and delicious

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
I actually wanted to take a picture of that

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
but I forgot like

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
cause I ate it for lunch

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
and that's when I took the nap

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I was extremely sleepy

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
I mean your loading screen has a cooking

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
yeah it does so I think it fits pretty well

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
hmm

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
and then next we have

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
ASMR

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
I'm actually gonna do an ASMR stream

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
this week

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
and I want you to know

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
like in advance

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
that

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
until I move out

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
which is gonna be probably around September

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
sadly I can't do anything

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
like soundproofing or anything like that

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
so

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
when I do ASMR streams

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
if you ever hear something from outside

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
or my neighbors from upstairs

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
the 3DO picks up

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
them like walking upstairs sometimes

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
or doing stuff it's honestly

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
insane how it just picks up things from the outside

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
it's like next time but

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
I'll try to see if maybe I can put

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
like maybe

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
thunder or

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
maybe rain sounds in the background

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
so that you can't

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
hear the background noise as much

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
basically

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
I just wanted to give a heads up

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
that until around September

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
that's my situation, that's my living situation

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
and I will still do my very best

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
to give you a good ASMR experience

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
and make do with what I have

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
basically and I hope that you'll enjoy it

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
I've enjoyed ASMR

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
for a very long time

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
for years now

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
and whenever I found out about it

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
that's when I felt those

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
those ASMR tingles and

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
I was like wow what is that feeling

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
and the thing is I have experienced ASMR

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
before I even knew what ASMR is

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
like I would get sometimes

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
tingles from certain sounds

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
but I never really knew what that sensation is

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
or if there's a name for it

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
so when I found out about ASMR

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
I was like wow

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
this is exactly the same feeling

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
that I got

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
back then

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
and so the more I started listening to ASMR

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
the more I was like

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
this sounds fun

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
I think it would be really cool to try making ASMR myself

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
and

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
try to make sounds

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
with different items

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
and seeing

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
what sounds they make because the cool thing about ASMR

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
is that

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
sometimes you can find an item

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
to make sounds with

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
and it can actually produce

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
many different sounds more than one

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
depending on how you tap it or how you hold it

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
or how you play around with it

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
and that's another thing that I always found cool

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
so sometimes I would go to random stores

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
and I would literally start tapping different items

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
or grab them

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
or move them around my ear

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
to see if it would make for a good sound

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
and stuff

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
so yeah

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
I'm definitely excited

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
to do nice ASMR

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
for you

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
and I really hope that you will enjoy it

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
I'm definitely going to have to

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
I'm definitely going to have to

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
make my collection bigger and bigger

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
I want to have an ASMR tingle box

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
where I will place

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
all the products that I'll be using to make ASMR

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
sounds with

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
so every time that I stream I can bring my tingle box

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
and play around with it

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
and make nice sounds with it

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
another thing

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
I know that ASMR also includes

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
whispering

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
and heartbeats

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
and sometimes

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
I also love to give hugs

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
so sometimes I will give you a hug

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
or a whisper

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
or maybe even say something

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
in Russian

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
I think I actually saw a Maro

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
asking me if there will be Russian

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
in my ASMR

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
and the answer is

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
during my ASMR streams

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
if there's ever a request

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
here we speak Russian

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
in my ASMR streams I could try

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
and do that sometimes

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
or take requests

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
something dirty

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
no

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
no Emi

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
I'm on YouTube

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
I need to be careful

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
you should be careful too

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
unless

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
you know maybe

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
okay listen maybe once we have

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
memberships open

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
maybe ASMR

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
membership ASMR streams

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
maybe there

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
I could get away with a little bit more

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
if it's also on archives

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
I don't know

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
YouTube has been

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
YouTube has been really weird lately

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
I'm just trying my best not to get in trouble

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
at the moment but

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
we'll see what happens

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
I also like to

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
make funny duels sometimes

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
I don't do that all the much

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
but when I do I have a lot of fun with it

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
so I'm thinking of maybe doing

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
eventually like a stream where

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
I

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
fuck my brain

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
oh my god

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
where I will

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
draw a customized version

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
of each

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
and every member that joins

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
on my membership

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
on my membership stream

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
I think maybe it would be a cute idea

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
if like I drew some

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
custom snowberries

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
for each and every person that joins

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
the membership

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
I don't know why I'm struggling so hard to talk

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
I really don't

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
I think it's because I also didn't talk for this long

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
in a very long time

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
like I really don't talk much

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
oh my god

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
a doodle stream while you're DJing would be cute

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
I can't do that

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
I need to

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
I need to have focus on the DJing when I DJ

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
that wouldn't be

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
possible

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
but it could be like a separate stream idea

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
where sometimes I do these stupid doodles

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
streams where I take requests

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
and draw the weirdest

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
ugliest things that I can

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
DJing requires two hands doesn't it

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
yeah it does

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
the thing is right now I don't even have a DJ deck

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
so my skills are not even fully

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
unleashed I use virtual

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
fuck I can't fucking talk

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
I use

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
I use

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
I use virtual

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
virtual

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
DJ in order to DJ

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
but that means I can really only use

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
mainly one hand

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
and I want to get an actual

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
DJ deck so that I can use both my hands

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
it will make it easier to mix

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
the songs as well in between

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
so that is something

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
that I would like to get eventually

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
so I can improve

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
I feel like not having a DJ deck

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
definitely limits my skills

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
or my ability to improve on it

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
uh

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
virtual DJ that's not what I said

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
I said virtual DJ

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
oh my god

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
oh my god

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
okay and then

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
oh god I'm gonna be here forever

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
one hand in DJing

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
wait a minute that's not what you think

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
no not like that

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
no I need to be on focus

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
I need to be on focus you know why

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
because I have had times when like

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
I was DJing and I would get

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
song to the music that I would actually forget to DJ

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
and then the song would end and I didn't do like

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
a transition to like another song

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
and I didn't mix in between so there was like complete silence

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
and I was like what the fuck

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
so no no no no I need to be fully focused

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
on my DJ streams because I don't want that to happen

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
it's so it's so embarrassing

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
I can't help myself some music is just so good

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
that I just get very into it

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
especially when I drink

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
like imagine you listen to good music and you drink

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
it's very easy to lose focus

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
to lose focus of yourself when you do those things

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
and then another thing

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
that's in my interest is retro games

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
I really really love retro games

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
it's a big part of my childhood

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
I will say though retro games

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
is not the only stuff that I will be playing

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
I will have like a game or two

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
that is more modern

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
or not retro

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
I like to try all types of different games

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
and if I think that I will like something I will play it

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
but if you do see quite a bit

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
of retro games and stuff like that

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
some weeks

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
that's why because I really love retro games

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
and there's

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
a lot of games that I would actually like to play

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
on stream

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
let me see

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
actually brought that up

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
there it is, here is a big listing

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
of some of my all time favorite

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
retro games actually

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
American McGee's Alice

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
it's actually the first game that comes between

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
before

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
excuse me

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
that

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
that comes before Alice Madras returns

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
and I actually think that this game

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
is even better than the second one

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
it's one of my all time favorites

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
Jazz Jack Rabbit 2

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
another game that's

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
one of my biggest childhood games

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
Blood Rain

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
all of these games here

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
I would be really happy to play them

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
so if you see anything

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
that you remember

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
or anything that looks like it would be fun

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
or you're excited about

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
then I hope you will

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
I hope you will enjoy watching me play those games

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
I really love the Tomb Raider series

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
all of them

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
but I will say though that I'm very bad at it

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
even in the past

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
when I played it as a kid

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
I was always bad at it

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
to the point that I would look for cheats

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
to skip certain levels

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
I'm just so bad at this game I don't know what it is

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
but I get lost very easily in games

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
very easily and I'm also

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
I'm also bad at puzzles as well

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
so I don't know

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
I love those games but I'm also too dumb to play them

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
that's basically what it is

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
and back then in Tomb Raider games

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
they didn't have maps

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
they didn't have a thing that showed you where to go next

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
or what to do so sometimes I would literally

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
spend hours and hours just circling

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
around the entire place

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
and not getting anywhere

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
so I was like fuck this shit I'm gonna use a cheat code

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
and I'm just gonna skip to the next level

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
so I can make progress

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
will I love for back seating

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
then to help you out

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
there's definitely games

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
where I would be more than happy

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
if you help me and tell me where to go

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
or how to solve a puzzle and stuff like that

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
I'll be honest

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
I'm not the smartest

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
I'm not the smartest period

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
I was gonna make like a sentence

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
but I didn't know what to say so I'm just gonna say

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
yeah I'm just not the smartest

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
to say this

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
I'm not good at video games but I guess it's also not surprising

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
I only recently came to the civilization

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
also I don't know if you noticed

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
but I also have Barbie Explorer

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
in my list

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
and the reason why it's another favorite for me

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
is because that game actually felt a lot like Tomb Raider

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
but

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
for babies basically

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
Tomb Raider but Barbie Edition

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
that is for

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
you know

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
for not so smart

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
challenged cubs like me

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
so that game was a lot easier

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
for me to play because

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
it was a lot easier obviously

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
but it still had a lot of Tomb Raider elements

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
so I enjoyed it a lot

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
GTA, Vice City

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
another really amazing game

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
that I love a lot

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
definitely one of my favorites, definitely a game I wanna play on stream

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
I'm definitely excited to

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
do GTA Vice City streams

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
I feel like it would be really funny

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
to do them

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
and when they showed

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
the trailer for the newest

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
GTA that's also in Vice City

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
but with the high graphics

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
and everything that will be available

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
either next

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
I can't remember, I think it's gonna be ready in like

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
2 years

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
I can't remember but the trailer looked so fucking good

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
and I'm so excited to play it whenever it does come out

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
yeah GTA 6

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
GTA 6 is gonna be wild and seeing Vice City

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
in almost like high graphics

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
I was like wow

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
look Vice City is looking so freaking good

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
I'm just so freaking high for it

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
it's gonna be amazing

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
but until then

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
GTA Vice City

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
and maybe even GTA San Andreas

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
are the 2 GTA games

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
that I would really love to play on stream

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
I think that would be really fun

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
lots of stuff to do

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
then we also have

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
ok so the thing is

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
silent hill

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
3

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
I remember getting this game

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
and wanting to play it really really badly

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
but I was too scared

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
I remember playing some levels during the day

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
to make it as least scary as possible

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
and I beat some levels

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
but I was too scared

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
I wonder if I play Silent Hill 3

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
on stream with your help

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
if maybe that would help me feel less scared

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
then maybe it could help me figure out

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
where to go

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
and how to solve puzzles

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
and all that stuff

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
cause I wanna like play through all of it

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
because it genuinely just looks so good

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
and cool but I'm scared

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
I'm too scared

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
I need my snowberries

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
to help me

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
and protect me

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
you get to prove your own growth

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
yeah I guess we'll see about that

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
there's also

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
there's also

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
there's also another one on this list

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
Drakan

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
Order of the Flames

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
another really good retro game

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
that I remember playing

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
but I never got to finish it because I remember

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
I was kinda near the end

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
at least I believe I was but I could never beat the level

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
because I think there was a puzzle or something

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
and I just could not figure it out

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
so I got to play it on stream

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
and hopefully actually get to finish the game

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
and see the ending

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
and you know I just think it will be

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
a very very nice experience to play all of these

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
childhood games

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
with you by my side

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
so I can talk about these games and play them

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
and have fun also I have the sims

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
I really want to make a household

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
in the sims of me and my gen mates

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
I think that would make for a really really fun stream

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
where it will be

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
excuse me

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
where it will be all six of us in a household

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
doing different things

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
definitely want to do that

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
I'll be honest

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
I want to play all of these games

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
at some point on stream so

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
there will obviously be other games that are now listed here

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
that I will

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
that I will play lakas in a pool and drown us

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
in me

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
I don't think I want to do stuff like that

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
not to my beloved friends anyways

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
not to my beloved friends

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
but I might do it to other people

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
depending on what happens

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
because the sims

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
the sims has an expansion pack

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
I think with

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
celebrities and stuff

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
and sometimes when you get very famous

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
sometimes you get a stalker

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
in your house

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
I think what will make for a fun content is

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
if we lock the stalker in a room

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
and then either burn him

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
or drown him in the water

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
or just like

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
figure out some funny things to do

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
that stalker me

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
I hope not

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
because your life will be ending very soon

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
what's wrong with VLurgers?

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
nothing, we are all amazing

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
there's nothing wrong with us

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
we are perfect

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
bruh she's gonna water board us

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
let's go

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
I need to be with the reaper

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
yes you do

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
sims 1 has very limited interactions

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
with the reaper

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
we are mentally ill

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
but I think it adds to our perfection

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
because what is a VTuber without mental illness?

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
bland and boring

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
that's right

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
sorry I don't know why I said that but I mean

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
it does add to our personality

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
you know

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
sorry

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
for saying weird things

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
I don't know what I'm doing

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
oh my god

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
ok so now that I've

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
yapped about some of my favorite games

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
let me go to

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
oops

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
no that's not what I wanted

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
ok here we go

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
oh god

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
here is a list

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
of some of my most

55:31.000 --> 55:34.000
shameless

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
vlog

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
mistakes were made

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
mistakes were made

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
don't

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
ignore that

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
ignore that that did not happen

55:52.000 --> 55:55.000
you did not see that that was nothing there

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
it was a joke guys

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
I put it there

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
and then showed it for one second exactly to get your reaction

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
it doesn't mean anything

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
anyways

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
here is a list of some of my most

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
favorite anime

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
happy sugar life

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
mitsudemoe kanon

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
2006

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
kurejime dg charat

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
ok I will say dg charat

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
I loved it so much and I'm so sad that

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
the original series

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
was like

56:40.000 --> 56:43.000
each episode was just 5 minutes

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
because I tried to watch

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
other seasons

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
where they have full episodes

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
but they don't have the same art style

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
as the original dg charat

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
and so it just didn't hit the same

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
so I was like

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
I was like man that sucks

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
because I was enjoying it so much

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
and I just love how back then

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
they made the funniest expressions

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
back then in anime

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
one of the stuff that I love about older anime

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
is how the art style looked

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
and also

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
and also how

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
the expressions that they drew

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
I don't know they just have so much life

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
they just have so much soul

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
they don't make them like that anymore

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
then there is akunohana

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
there is nana

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
ichigo machimato

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
definitely an anime

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
that I want to do a watch along with

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
if you would like to join me

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
there is a couple of anime here

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
that I really want to do a watch along with you all

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
I think it would be really nice to

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
cozy up and watch some nice anime together

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
and this is definitely one of the ones that I would like

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
it's just really nice and cozy

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
elf and light

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
such a good anime

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
honestly

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
it's weird back then I used to be able to watch

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
really

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
what's the word

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
I'm trying to say

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
hard to watch

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
maybe or

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
let's just say

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
for me now

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
I don't know if I would be able to rewatch it

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
because I feel like it would just make me cry

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
and make me too sad

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
but back then I was able to watch stuff like that

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
without any problem it's really weird

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
it's like I develop emotions

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
it's like I develop emotions now

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
now that I'm here in civilization

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
suddenly I'm feeling emotions

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
and I can't watch some stuff that I used to watch

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
I can't fucking talk

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
I don't master Cinderella girls

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
you 149

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
another one I would love to do a watch along with

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
another one that I want to do a watch along with

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
it's so funny I love it

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
I don't think I'll do a watch along with that

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
the thing for me with Made on Abyss

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
it is such a freaking good anime

59:53.000 --> 59:56.000
but it is too hard breaking for me to

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
rewatch it

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I remember crying so much watching it

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I felt like I'm gonna get into depression

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
or something after watching it

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I don't want to risk that

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
it's just too sad to watch again

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
but it is extremely extremely good anime

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
the story is very good

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
but my heart is just too soft

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
to rewatch stuff like that

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
as a mankadeyo

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
another good anime

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
and a huge huge favorite of mine

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I just remember so many good memories watching it

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I think it would be genuinely so so fun

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
school days

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
another good anime

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
the ending

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I love the ending it was so good

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
another really good and funny one

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
that I used to enjoy a lot

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I also remember

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
NHK

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Yugosl

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
another big anime

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
that was one of my favorites

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I don't know if it sounds cringe

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
but welcome to the NHK

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
sorry

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
fuck I can't talk

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I'm talking so much that I feel like I'm eating my words

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
and like I can't talk

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
okay okay

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
okay

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
okay

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
they are being

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
okay

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
so when I watched

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
welcome to the NHK

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I don't know if it's cringe

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
but

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
you know the girl in the anime

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
that he talks to the girl with the short hair

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
that's wearing a white yellow t-shirt

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I can't remember what her name is

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
but I remember watching this anime

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
and being like

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
yeah she saw me

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
one day I'm gonna find a guy just like that

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
and I'm gonna fix

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I'm gonna be just like her

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
and then I'm gonna find someone to fix

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
and then there's like that scene

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
at the end

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
where she's really sad

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
and I think I can't remember

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
but correct me if I'm wrong

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
she is you know really depressed

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
and sad as well

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
and I think she is like about to

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
end her life I think

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
and I was like oh my god that's literally me

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I would like literally watch that episode

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
while I was crying and I was like

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
it's literally me

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
they made this anime about me

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
oh my god

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
yeah um I relate

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
I relate it too hard too

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
she's literally me

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
oh my god yeah that was one of those

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
moments where I look back on

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
and I'm kinda cringing

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I can't fix each other

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
you never know we might

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I'm hopeful

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I'm hopeful for the future

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
in the book he fixes her

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
yeah I was like oh my god that's so romantic

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
I really wanted him to kiss her

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
in that scene I was like oh my god I hope they kiss

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I hope they kiss

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
it makes each other by being together

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
and then love life

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I love

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
why does that sentence sound so weird to say

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
I love love life

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I'm probably overthinking it

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I really love the love life series

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I've watched all the seasons

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I've loved every single one of them

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
and I might go watch along

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
of those as well

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
who is your love life best girl

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
for each generation

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
it's a different girl

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
so for me

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
in the first generation

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
honestly first generation is so good

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
it's hard to pick a favorite

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
but whenever I played the rhythm

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
love life game

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
I would always make sure to get

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
the ultra rare cards

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
for Niko's birthday

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
and Allie

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I used to really like Allie because

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
she is part Russian

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
and she loves chocolate a lot

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
and I was like oh my god she is literally me

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
but her personality wasn't really me

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
but because

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
she was part Russian

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
and because

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
she would really love chocolate

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I was like she is literally me

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I think

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I think now I would probably be closer

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I would probably be closer to Niko

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
to be honest

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
but I don't have my sweet moments

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
as well so I would

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I would definitely have to be like a mix between Niko

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
and like another girl

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
but I'm not sure who

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
maybe Rin

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
because I don't know if you ever watched

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
love life but

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
in the first generation

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
there is an episode about Rin

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
where

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
where she really wants to

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
feel girly

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
and cute and she struggles

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
to feel that way

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
and I can't remember

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
in details about the episode but basically

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
she feels like she is not cute enough

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
but she wants to be

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
and I think at some point of the episode

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
she finally gets to wear a really

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
feminine and super cute

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
freely idol dress

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
for one of her performances

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
and that's when she gets extremely happy

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
and she finally feels cute enough

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
and I really

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I really relate it to that

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
episode and to her because

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I would have moments too

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
where I wanted to be

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
extremely cute

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
and I would always worry that

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I'm not cute enough

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I don't know, my personality is not cute enough

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
and yeah

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
and that's the thing, I really love

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
girly stuff

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I really love plushies, I love cute dresses

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
and skirts and all of that stuff

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
and it actually

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
wasn't until later in my life that I started

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
wearing dresses and skirts

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
because

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
in my early life

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I felt like Rin, you know

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I felt like I'm not cute enough to wear dresses

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
or skirts and stuff like that

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
but you know the more time went by

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I started to experiment with

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
wearing dresses and skirts and stuff

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
and now that's pretty much the only thing that I wear

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
I don't have

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
any pants or anything

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
when I go outside I always wear either a skirt

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
or a dress when I go outside

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
so yeah I do wear

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
a bunch of cute stuff these days

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
and yeah that's

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
like one of the stuff that made me think about it

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
so I think

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I would probably be like a mix between Rin

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
and Nico

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
also because Rin can be pretty hyper

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
and when I have lots of energy I can get super hyper

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
and extremely silly and dumb and that is

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
a big part of her personality as well

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
and then for

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
the second generation

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
for the second generation of love life

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Ruby

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Ruby is actually my most favorite one

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
because she is extremely shy and insecure

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
and second guesses herself

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
a lot

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
but she wants to do the best

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
to overcome that

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
and as you read

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
her stuff

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
and as time goes by

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
she gains confidence

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
and gets better and better in what she does

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
and it's really nice to see

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000
the development

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
like from how she started

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000
versus how she

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
what's the word

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I'm trying to think of the word

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
I'm trying to say

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
fully develop

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
character development

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
basically she wants

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
from being insecure

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
and shy and second guessing herself

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
to becoming a lot more confident

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
and really shining through

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
and that's how I want to be

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I want to be the same way

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
and whenever I get insecure and when I second guess myself

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I think of Ruby and I remind myself

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
that if she did it I can do the same thing

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
and I can grow as well

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
and yeah

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I really can't wait to see

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
like compare a year from now

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
how much I changed

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I think it would be really funny if a year from now

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
we rewatched this exact stream

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
and see the difference in how I talk

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
and the difference in my manners

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
and the way that I communicate with you guys

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I think that would be really funny

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
to be honest

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
because I think there would be a big difference

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
because right now I'm still like saddling in and shy

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000
and overwhelmed and nervous

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
and I have moments where I get insecure

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
or second guess myself

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
but I know that we can all grow with time

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
and improve on this thing

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
so yeah

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
lane

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
another good anime

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
all of the anime here are really good

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I'm just yapping so much that I end up not

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
talking about each and every one of them

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
because I feel like

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I feel like I'm yapping too much

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
and I'm like who cares

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
shut up who asked

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
like while I'm talking about it

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I'm just like who asked

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
who cares

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000
why was I talking about this

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
no no we love the app

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
we care

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
we asked

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
you're yapping is good

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
we ask thank you very much

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
thank you

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
that's really sweet

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
thank you for saying all that stuff

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
it's really reassuring

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
and helps me

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
gain a little bit more confidence

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I'm still

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I know I'm like a big confident

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
like brat on twitter

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
and stuff like that

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
but when I get on stream

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I'm like

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I just get all shy

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
I don't know why

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I don't know why I'm shy

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
why would I be shy

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
of some OGs that are watching me

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
why would I be shy

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
I can't help it

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I'm really nervous

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
yeah

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I wish I was naturally confident

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
from day one I wish I did

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
my 2.0 stream today and I was like

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
hello OGs you're all disgusting

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I don't care about what you say we're gonna be talking about me

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
because that's all that matters

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
and blah blah blah

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
but I don't know I just I

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I can't do that right now

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I'm still

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I'm still

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I'm still trying to

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
get over my shyness

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
yeah

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
now that you said it you know what I think would be funny

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
I think it would be really funny if like right now

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
a lot of you enjoy my shyness

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
and awkwardness

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
and then once I get more confident

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
you will be like man I miss the days

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000
when I see snow paws was so cute

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
and shy and reserved

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
now she's such a bitch

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
now she's such a fucking brat

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
what happened

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
oh no

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
oh no

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
no

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
gap might

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
maybe

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
no

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
kindness doesn't go away

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
maybe I don't know

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I guess I'm just trying to be

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
my most authentic self

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
there's a sentence

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000
that someone once said

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000
where it says

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
being your authentic self

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
is your ideal self

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000
so whenever I second guess myself

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
or I'm not sure

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
how much to show

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
of myself and stuff like that

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I think of that

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
sentence and I'm like

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
just be authentic

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000
just be as authentic as you can be because that is

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
the most best version of yourself

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
so that's what I'm gonna do

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
and that's just what I'm gonna do

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
and what I think is the best thing to do

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
and that's just like naturally how I am

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
that's the thing with me

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
I've always been like that

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000
people around like new people

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
that I'm still getting to know

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
and

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
just start talking to

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
I'm always more shy and reserved

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
but then once you get to know me

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
and I get really comfortable around you

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
I just become a man

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
sometimes and I just become extra ready

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
and that's when you will see all of those

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
sides of me shine more

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
this small period of time

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
where I'm feeling still

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
extra shy and stuff

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
so enjoy this shyness

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
while you can I guess

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
so you're saying you need to defrost

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
that's actually a good way to

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
put it I think so

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I think I need to defrost

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
give me a few more streams

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
and you'll probably start to see

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
my other parts

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
start to show

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
more and more

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
honestly I don't really know

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
what else to say regarding my anime taste

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
all I will say is

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000
that I will have

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
um

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I will do watch-alongs

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
of some of them and also some

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
that aren't listening here

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000
because I think it would be fun

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
but again I also want your honest opinion

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
like for example if we ever do a watch-along

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
and you find it boring

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
and enjoy it

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I would want you to give me feedback

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
and let me know

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
and I just won't do watch-alongs anymore

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
or I'll do them less or something like that

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
because I want to have fun

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
but I also want you to have fun as well

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I want to still hang out together and

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
enjoy each other's company

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
one stream of overcooked 2 would kill the allure

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
okay I agree

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
I have played that game before a couple of times

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
and oh my god that game

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
at the start it's kinda manageable

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
but it gets so difficult

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
that my brain just can't handle it and it becomes just complete chaos

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
like I don't even know what I'm doing anymore

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
kinda chaos

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
okay so

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
enough

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000
enough with this

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
what was I gonna show

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
there was another slide

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I'm trying to find it

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
sorry

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
where is it

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
I already showed this one

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
where is the one I'm looking for

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
no not this one

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
no not this one

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
no not this one

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
professional streamer

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
okay

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
okay

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
okay so

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
before you say anything

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I know I have some

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
really big goals

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
enormous goals

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
to say the least but

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
again

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I'm a believer in

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000
the ability

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000
for us to reach our dreams and make them

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
a reality even if at first they seem

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
really out of reach

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000
and big

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
the more time goes the more

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I think it's possible to reach them

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
and continue working towards

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
all of them

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
so my first goal

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
is a youtube play button

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000
to get

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
and such a big milestone to reach

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
I think when a few years pass by

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
and I look back on it I would be like wow

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
I really did that

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
I actually achieved that

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
that's so cool

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
another goal that I have is the 3D DJ party

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
that I already actually brought up

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
in today's stream I already touched

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000
based on that and explained it

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I really want to have a 3D DJ party

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
in an IRL venue

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
where you guys could actually go inside an IRL venue

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
and see us in 3D

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
and dance with us and party with us

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
and interact with us

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I think that would be such a cool concept

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
that's different than the usual

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Vtuber concerts because that's been done

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
multiple times but this specific thing

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000
hasn't been done yet and I'm really hoping that

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
VLR can be the first

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
place to make that happen

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
I just think it would be a really cool thing to do

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
original song

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
is another thing that I'm hoping to achieve

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
now I'm not a singer

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
by any means

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
I don't have those amazing singing skills

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
or nothing

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
but again it's one of those things

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
that I really want to

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
write off my bucket list

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
it's one of the things that I want to know

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
that I did at least once in my life

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
really cute and cool to have

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000
my own original song made

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000
and I don't know I think that would be exciting

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
and really cool

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
any ideas for the song

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
as of right now I'll be honest

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
I'm not so sure

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
but I think the more time goes

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000
the more I'll probably

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000
have more of an idea

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000
right now it's more of a general goal

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000
I don't really have the details

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
figured out and stuff like that yet

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000
another goal of mine

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.000
is by parents

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000
a house or be able

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000
to support them enough so that

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
they can retire

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000
my parents are both really the most amazing people

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
in the world

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
they've given everything for me and beyond

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
they always made sure

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000
to keep me as happy as I can

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000
always work extremely hard

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
always been supportive

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
of what I wanted to do

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
always loved me and accepted me

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
the more time goes by

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
the more I'm like

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
I just really want them to retire

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
I really want the rest of their lives

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
to be just relaxing

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
and having a good time

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
and not worry about work anymore

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
and get them a nice house

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
where they can be living life

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
because they genuinely deserve it

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000
they've given me so much love

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
just so many things

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
to be honest this goal

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
is my number one goal

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
to be honest

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000
if I can give that to them one day

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000
I'll honestly be the most fulfilled

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000
and happy that I can be

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
you know that I can give my parents a better life

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
and give them back

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
for all the insane

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
amount of love and attention and hard work

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
that they've put into me

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I love them very much

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000
they actually

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
know that I'm a VTuber and that I stream

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
and they're extremely supportive

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
and they're super sweet about it

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
actually whenever I

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000
sometimes I would talk with them

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
and video chat with them

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
and so there was this one time when I showed them

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
what I look like

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
in my polar bear form

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
and they were amazed

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
they were like wow it looks just like you

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
they were so excited they got

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000
and I also remember when I got

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
the email

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000
the big email from VLR

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000
for an interview and stuff

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I told my parents when I finally got accepted

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
and my dad was so happy for me

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
that he started dancing

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
and he almost fell

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
I was so sweet and supportive

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000
and happy for me

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
it was just super cute and I'm like

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000
man I do it for that

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000
I also want to adopt

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000
many more cats

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000
so they can have better life

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000
and a forever home

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000
I have two cats already but I do want to have more

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000
because I really love going to the animal shelter

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
and check

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000
on the new cats that I have sometimes

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
and

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
sorry

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
and there's just so many

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
cats in there that are super sweet

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
and nice and

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I just want them to give them a good life

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I want to know

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
that this cute cat or these cute cats

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
will live their best life

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000
that they possibly can experience

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
so that's another thing that I really want to do

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
there's also a lot of

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
such sweet old cats that don't get adopted

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I really want to adopt

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
some old cats as well

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
I feel like they really deserve a lot of love

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000
and I really want to make sure that the time

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
that they do have left

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.000
will be spent being the happiest that they can be

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
and then another goal

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000
is to appear at cons

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000
or meet ups and stuff like that to meet you

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000
it's just such a big dream of mine

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
I think it would be like honestly

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
the coolest thing ever to actually see all of you

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000
and talk to you and say hi to you

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000
and I don't know isn't that exciting

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000
that would be just

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000
like you know

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
the coolest thing ever

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
and it's just

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I don't know there's just something about it

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
that would make me feel really happy

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
and excited to actually get to meet each and one of you

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
and it's just

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
it's just really cool and I hope I get

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000
to do that

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I really hope I get to do that someday

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I think that would be really nice thing

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000
to do

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
hold on

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
sorry

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
my eye was itchy

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
I had to scratch it back

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000
okay so

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:41.760
I basically got 100% of all sales, yeah, yeah, yeah, all sales, yeah, I get 100% of sales.

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:49.760
So if you want to support me, this is a really, really good way to support me and my gen mates, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:54.760
Amazing, right? Okay, so let me show you some of the merch.

01:35:54.760 --> 01:36:04.760
We have a cute keychain with an acrylic, me being all EP and cute.

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:07.760
And look at that.

01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:20.760
Thank God this is not my official debut, because wow, that would have been like the shittiest debut in all history.

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:28.760
The cute thing about the keychain is that you can basically carry me around anywhere you go.

01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:40.760
You go, if you go anywhere, just put me on your back or as a phone charm or wherever and I'll just be there.

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:48.760
Just like pocket, icy snowpies, always there to give you moral support.

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.760
I don't know what I'm saying.

01:36:50.760 --> 01:37:03.760
And then another thing that we have, excuse me, an acrylic stand.

01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:11.760
So in those days that you don't go anywhere, if you just want to be home and stay and relax,

01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:19.760
and let's say, you know, it's the middle of the night and you're feeling lonely and you miss me and you're like,

01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:23.760
man, I miss icy snowpies.

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:27.760
I wish you was here with me, coddling me.

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:30.760
Well, do I have the solution for you?

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:39.760
You see this? Just get this acrylic stand of me and put it in your bed, put the cover and

01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:44.760
cuddle with me and just go to town.

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:47.760
Do whatever you want with me, you know?

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:50.760
Pleasure all my...

01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:54.760
The fuck is my problem?

01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:58.760
What is my problem?

01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:03.760
And we also have really cool sweatpants.

01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:12.760
So whenever you want to wear something inside your house, but still feel cool and fashionable,

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:17.760
you can get these sweatpants that look really cute and really cool.

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:24.760
They have all of these snow prints on it.

01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:31.760
So whenever you walk around the house and someone comes in or you just look in the mirror

01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:41.760
and you're like, man, these snow prints, wow, they make me think of icy.

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:49.760
Man, I miss her, but damn, do I look cool with these sweatpants?

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:57.760
Oh my god, I'm so sorry that you're witnessing this.

01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:59.760
I apologize.

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:12.760
And then we also have a really, really cute hoodie with this really, really nice art with me on it.

01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:23.760
So if you are the kind of person that loves hoodies and feels comfy in them, well, look at this amazing thing.

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:35.760
It has this beautiful art of me and then on the sides of the arms, it has those eyes.

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:39.760
Not eyes, fuck, I'm stupid, the freaking snowflakes.

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:43.760
The freaking snowflakes, that's the word I was looking for.

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.760
Oh my god, I'm stupid.

01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:52.760
It has snowflakes on the arms and if you get it together with the sweatpants, it will be basically like I said.

01:39:52.760 --> 01:40:07.760
However, if a hoodie is in your thing or the weather is getting too hot for a hoodie right now, for most places anyways, you can just get a t-shirt.

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:15.760
Yeah, now that it's getting hotter and it's becoming somewhere, you can just wear a t-shirt as well.

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:29.760
So if you wanna go outside or even wear it inside the house and always have me around or show everyone how cool you are, this t-shirt is definitely for you.

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.760
Definitely recommend.

01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:41.760
I really hope that you like all these merch stuff.

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:44.760
Let me post the link again.

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:49.760
Fuck, what is enough?

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:50.760
Oh, okay.

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.760
Oh no, my arm, fuck.

01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:56.760
I need to get rid of that.

01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:06.760
I keep bringing the other fucking cold ice cones.

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:11.760
I keep bringing up the freaking third arm with ice cones.

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:13.760
I need to get rid of that.

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:17.760
I keep pushing it accidentally.

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:21.760
I just keep pushing it accidentally like a dumbass.

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:24.760
Oh my god, I'm sorry about that.

01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:26.760
Hold on.

01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:29.760
Let me sit back.

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:31.760
Let me sit, fuck.

01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:33.760
Okay, let me...

01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:38.760
Okay, now more comfy.

01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:40.760
Nice, nice, nice.

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:45.760
Is that your special merch I see?

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:47.760
What do you mean by special?

01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:56.760
I mean, if there's a merch of me, I mean, all of it is special, right?

01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:58.760
Spy Team Fortress 2?

01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:01.760
Well, what do you mean?

01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:07.760
How could my kusuga be so cute and pun?

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:09.760
I honestly don't know.

01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:12.760
It's just the nature of me, strongy.

01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:15.760
That's how I am at first.

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:20.760
And as time goes by, I become more and more ready.

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.760
You are special?

01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:25.760
Yeah, mentally.

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.760
But thank you.

01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:30.760
What are we talking about, chat?

01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:33.760
We're talking about my merch.

01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:35.760
Merch?

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:37.760
Yeah!

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:41.760
Man, that was so embarrassing.

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:44.760
Like, what was that?

01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:48.760
I think I'm gonna cringe at that for the rest of my life.

01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:57.760
I'm really trying to sell stuff to you and all I have to say is merch, yeah.

01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:04.760
Well, we know you are, but underneath the bradians...

01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:06.760
Wait, I'm a bit confused.

01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:08.760
What do you mean by that?

01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:11.760
I think you missworded what you were trying to say.

01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:15.760
Do we get an icy cup to come pre-filled?

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:19.760
No.

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.760
Not yet anyways.

01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:22.760
I think.

01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:24.760
I mean, we'll see what happens, maybe.

01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:26.760
Maybe in the future.

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:29.760
You already sold it to me easy.

01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:30.760
Wow, really?

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:33.760
Wow, I'm honestly impressed.

01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:37.760
That just that alone would be enough.

01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:40.760
It's our thing now.

01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:41.760
Merch, yes?

01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:42.760
Get your sentence?

01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:43.760
Oh, no.

01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:57.760
Out of all, like, cool sentences that I could have, like, come up with, or, like, a motto or something, like, that's the best that I have, like, really?

01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:06.760
I think they meant underneath your guffinius, your brad.

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:08.760
Yeah, well, it is.

01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:15.760
I would say that I can be, like, a bit of a sweet brat.

01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:17.760
I don't know if that makes any sense.

01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:23.760
Like, I enjoy being a brat because obviously it's really funny and entertaining for me,

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:28.760
but I have my sweet moments as well, you know?

01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:32.760
Don't undersell yourself.

01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:42.760
Yeah, I'm trying my best to work on becoming more confident and stuff like that, and that's second guessing myself as much.

01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:52.760
Honestly, I would 100% buy a shirt that just says Merch, yeah?

01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:54.760
Wow, new Merch idea.

01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:56.760
Oh my God, Stroney, look at that.

01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:59.760
Here you go, here's the new Merch idea.

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:07.760
Get a t-shirt and have it say Merch, yeah, and a picture of me.

01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:12.760
Oh my God, that would be so goofy.

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:25.760
You're Merch missing a hat and shoes, if there are, it'll be full armor.

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.760
Who knows, maybe eventually that would be a thing.

01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:31.760
I'm not really sure.

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:35.760
Oh my God, I keep having to clear my throat so much, I'm so sorry.

01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:41.760
But yeah, if you notice me muting a lot, it's because I keep having to clear my throat.

01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:48.760
I don't think, I don't know the last time I have talked so much, honestly.

01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:56.760
I've been yapping for almost two hours non-stop, so I guess that would make sense.

01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:02.760
I just constantly have to clear my throat, I didn't speak that much for such a long time.

01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:05.760
Clearing your throat, she just liked me.

01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:08.760
It's honestly really annoying, it's so annoying.

01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:14.760
I just want to be able to talk and talk non-stop and not have it cut in my way.

01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:17.760
At least you're comfortable streaming.

01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:24.760
Yeah, the more streams I have, the more comfortable I'm with.

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:29.760
Don't mute yourself, we need every cough.

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:33.760
We just want to hear your sneezes because of that.

01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:36.760
I don't know about that.

01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:40.760
I don't know if you want to hear it.

01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:44.760
I don't know about that.

01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:47.760
I don't know if you want to hear it.

01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:50.760
I don't know.

01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:56.760
I don't know if you want to hear me clear my throat.

01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:59.760
I don't know, that's a very pleasant sound.

01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:06.760
Fastest yapper in the west.

01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:14.760
That sniffing video was, well, not video short.

01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:15.760
It's pretty cute.

01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:22.760
Actually, I don't know if I'm allowed to say it, but I hope it's okay.

01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:25.760
I don't think it's a bad thing.

01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:36.760
There's actually going to be a short meme ASMR video coming up of me sniffing.

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:50.760
I actually noticed that after my short, a lot of people said that they really like when I do the sniffing in ASMR.

01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:58.760
So yeah, if you really like sniffing in ASMR, a short video is going to come up.

01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:00.760
Oh my god, no graduate right now.

01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:02.760
I see you on that sandwich.

01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:04.760
Okay, okay, I wasn't sure.

01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:09.760
I wasn't sure how much I'm allowed to say or not.

01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:18.760
But yeah, if you're into ASMR sniffing out, there will be a short ASMR video coming up with that.

01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:20.760
I don't like sniffing ASMR.

01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:23.760
I think it could be pretty nice.

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:33.760
But it's a bit tricky to do because whenever I do it, I'm not sure if I'm doing it too loud or if it sounds good or not.

01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:45.760
So I guess you can give me feedback on that when that video is going to be up.

01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:47.760
But will you be sniffing though?

01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:49.760
You of course!

01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:51.760
Yeah!

01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:53.760
Obviously I'm going to be sniffing you.

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:55.760
Who cares about anything else?

01:48:55.760 --> 01:49:02.760
I want to sniff you and know your nice scent.

01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:04.760
Video goes up later today.

01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:07.760
Oh, nice! I had no idea. That's awesome.

01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:09.760
Okay, that's good to know.

01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:13.760
So see, the sniffing ASMR is actually going to be up later today.

01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:16.760
So yeah, thank you for letting me know, Strani.

01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:18.760
That's awesome.

01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:20.760
Oh, do you sound sniffing?

01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:24.760
Yeah, trying to make sure I remember that scent very well.

01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:26.760
Oh, do you sound sniffing?

01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:32.760
Wait, wait, let me shower first.

01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:38.760
Okay, well, time is ticking, so you better get in that shower.

01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:51.760
The thing was by TF2 is there's a glitch in the mission where he has three arms, so kind of reference.

01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:59.760
I used to play a lot of TF2 in the past.

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:02.760
And I used to main the heavy.

01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:09.760
I don't know if you know why, but his Russian accent.

01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:17.760
And because I speak Russian, I thought it would be funny to main him.

01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:22.760
Besides that, I also really love his weapon.

01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:29.760
I really love the ability to be extra strong in games.

01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:33.760
And I love how fast his weapon goes.

01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:39.760
Because it just goes just shooting non-stop.

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:44.760
So yeah, I used to main the heavy and it's always been really fun.

01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:52.760
Sometimes I would also play as engineer, I think.

01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:58.760
Sometimes I would also play as engineer, but yeah, heavy was my main.

01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:05.760
Heavy was my main, and I just have such good memories playing TF2.

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:18.760
I wonder if it would be possible to ever play TF2 with you?

01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:23.760
I would have to figure that out. How would that work if it was possible?

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:28.760
Because it wouldn't be cool if we played it together or something.

01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:34.760
I mean, I'm gonna suck. I haven't played it in a few years.

01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:38.760
It's been such a long time, but I think that would be really cool.

01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:47.760
So if it was possible and I could figure out a way to make it work, I think that would be cool.

01:51:47.760 --> 01:52:03.760
But regardless of that, I really want to find games that, you know, games where a lot of people can play together, if that makes sense.

01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:08.760
I think that would be really fun as well.

01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:29.760
I know there's like the usual fall guys and stuff, but if you have any recommendations for multiplayer games that allow quite a bit of people in it, I think that would be really cool if we can do that.

01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:37.760
I think that would be fun to meet you in-game and play and do fun stuff.

01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:40.760
I think that would be really nice.

01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:43.760
Nice quality time together in a way.

01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:55.760
I know technically this is our quality time because I'm talking to you right now, but I meant quality time where we actually do stuff together, if that makes sense.

01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:59.760
Monster Hunter?

01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:03.760
I'm really bad at Monster Hunter.

01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:05.760
Like really bad.

01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:07.760
Like so bad that...

01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:11.760
Man, I'm really bad at games.

01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:15.760
Like I feel in group games and stuff like that.

01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:19.760
I'm probably just going to hold back.

01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:21.760
Hold everyone down?

01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:23.760
Is that how you say it?

01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:27.760
I can't forget, there's a way to say it.

01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:32.760
Like hold everyone back or hold everyone down.

01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:35.760
Just because of how bad I am in games, but...

01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:37.760
Oh well.

01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:40.760
Minecraft?

01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:43.760
Okay, so...

01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:46.760
Okay, Minecraft, so...

01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:49.760
Ah...

01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:54.760
How do I...

01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:58.760
How do I explain it?

01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:06.760
Okay, so Minecraft for me, I will say right now, I don't care about the building part of it.

01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:08.760
I just don't care about the building.

01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:14.760
If I do build something, it's going to look like a freaking box.

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:16.760
And it's going to look messy.

01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:18.760
It's going to look like trash.

01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:22.760
I'm the kind of person that if I will play Minecraft,

01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:25.760
I will be the person that causes trouble.

01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:29.760
I will start throwing explosives everywhere.

01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:33.760
I will start punching everyone and run away.

01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:38.760
I will want to go exploring and kill monsters.

01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:42.760
And collect like cool shiny stuff or like heal.

01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:49.760
You know, things are hard to kill, but like team up and stuff like that.

01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:56.760
But yeah, like the building aspect of Minecraft is just...

01:54:56.760 --> 01:54:59.760
Not for me, I just...

01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:02.760
I just don't care about that part of the game.

01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:04.760
I just don't.

01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:11.760
I want to like do funny and cool stuff.

01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:18.760
Breddy bear blows up a Jason's house with TNT traps.

01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:21.760
Yeah, that is something I would definitely do.

01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:23.760
Do you like Terraria?

01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:26.760
I've played it a bit here and there.

01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:32.760
It was a nice game, but I could never like really fully get into it.

01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:37.760
Not that I'm like into Minecraft either.

01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:45.760
Like for me, I would only play it with my gen mates, you know?

01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:51.760
Like when we get like a server and we can play together,

01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:54.760
then I would love to play it with them, you know?

01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:57.760
But I'm not into like playing it on my own

01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:01.760
because that would just be like really boring for me personally.

01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:13.760
Sorry, my brain is getting fried.

01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:16.760
Hold on, I also want to check something.

01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:18.760
I want to check something.

01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:29.760
I know that Strani is supposed to stream pretty soon, I think, right?

01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:32.760
If I'm correct, let me check.

01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:43.760
Oh yeah, she's going to stream in like six minutes.

01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:45.760
She's going to stream in like six minutes.

01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:50.760
So I wonder if it would be a good idea if I end the stream here

01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:53.760
and I redirect you guys to her stream

01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:56.760
because honestly, I want to be in that stream

01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:00.760
and be in her chat and listen to her

01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:02.760
because she's going to have a really fun stream today.

01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:06.760
She's going to be exposing via lore.

01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:08.760
She's going to be exposing via lore.

01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:10.760
Talk about behind the scenes and all that stuff.

01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:13.760
So it's going to be super, super fun.

01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:19.760
So I think what I should do right now is I'm going to end the stream.

01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:22.760
Please, please don't leave, please don't leave.

01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:27.760
Once I end the stream, you will automatically be redirected into Strani's stream

01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:31.760
and she'll be talking about all behind the scenes,

01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:34.760
all the juicy stuff.

01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:37.760
And yeah, I think you will really, really enjoy it.

01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:40.760
I know I will and I am in VLR.

01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:44.760
So we can both hang out in her chat.

01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:49.760
So for I leave, I wanted to say thank you, thank you, thank you so much

01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:51.760
for showing up to my stream today.

01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:56.760
Thank you for hearing me up for two hours.

01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:58.760
I had a lot of fun with you.

01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:00.760
Thank you for being so sweet to me.

01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:03.760
Thank you for all the kind words

01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:05.760
and support.

01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:10.760
And I will see you again tomorrow at the same time.

01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:13.760
I will be playing Tomb Raider Legends,

01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:16.760
which is one of my favorite Tomb Raider games.

01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:23.760
I will see you tomorrow.

01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:25.760
I'm going to miss you.

01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:26.760
Don't miss me too much.

01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:28.760
You'll see me again soon.

01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:30.760
And let's go.

01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:31.760
Let's go to Strani.

01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:33.760
Let's go watch her stream.

01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:35.760
Bye bye for now.

01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:38.760
Bye bye.
