1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,680
Fear is an emotion that has faded my mind for as long as I can remember, yet, today,

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,280
I am scared.

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,040
I cannot remember when or how I came to this land.

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,880
Mother tells me she had followed a trail from a mysterious wreckage and found me in a cave.

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:38,680
I was surrounded by death and darkness, yet I was the only one to survive.

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,240
This day she told me of was the last time I had ever cried.

7
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:50,520
She had seen the unfathomable abuse that plagued her family for generations, the monster of

8
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,240
a bear that wriggled fear throughout the food chain of this land.

9
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:03,840
Its mere presence cursing the very soil under the snow, that, here it was, that at the hands

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,400
of a mere child who said crying alone.

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,200
It was then she had decided to raise me as her own, along with my brother and sister.

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:22,360
She taught me strength to hunt, to survive.

13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,360
I had no memories of my birth family.

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,960
I did not feel the need to search for them, or I had my family here, and they had me.

15
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,320
I was a bear like them, and they treated me no different.

16
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,600
We all shared the same love, but Mama knew it was not meant to be.

17
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:49,640
There comes a time in the bear's life where they must go out on their own, and that time

18
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,080
was approaching fast.

19
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:59,880
Mama knew the cops would be fine, but me, I couldn't even find them being without them.

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,560
Until one day, over the mountains, she happened upon an answer.

21
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,320
An answer I didn't want to accept, but one I had to.

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:19,120
And now, this day, the day if fear finally formed in my heart for the first time, saying

23
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,400
their final goodbyes, my brother went one way, my sister went another.

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,440
But there I stood, my body and mind, tempered from this land of unforgiving cold, was frozen

25
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,360
still.

26
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,640
Mother offered me her strength one last time, enough to cement the final memory of her tenderness,

27
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,160
my final goodbye.

28
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,600
She would watch over me one last time, when my journey down from the mountaintop into

29
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,800
the unknown of the future.

30
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,400
The memory of her love within me made the fear in my heart melt away, like the ice and

31
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
spring.

32
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,000
But she reminded me that the warmth of her love made me into a survivor.
