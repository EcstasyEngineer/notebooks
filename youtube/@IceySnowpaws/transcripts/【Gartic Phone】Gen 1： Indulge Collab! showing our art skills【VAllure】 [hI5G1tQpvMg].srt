1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, I don't know.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What?

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What is happening?

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm live right now. I'm live. I'm live too.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What are we even doing?

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh God, what a disaster.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What?

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Blah blah blah blah blah.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What? We're live! We're live in me!

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
She's like, fuck this stream. I'm gonna go make some tea.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What a disaster.

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh my God.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What?

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Power washer, if you haven't played the entire campaign, it doesn't allow you to have six persons in your lobby.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And I'm the only one with a finished save file and it was too late to like ship all the like code and information to like send on on your stream.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And so basically she be rescued. She be was like, right, I'll set this one out. You guys just do it.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And we're like, no, we can't do it. The whole point of this is that we're all together in this.

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So then we're like, right, who's got Gmod, right? I don't have it, right? Who's got Raph, right? I don't have it, right? Who's got this game? I don't have it.

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I was trying my best.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
She was like going through the list. She was flicking them pages like next page, next page, next game, next game.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Okay, that won't work.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay, sure.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
All right, we'll do Jack Fox. And then wait, that requires us to screen record this court.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm like, we can't have that. We see every just things in the discord.

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We don't even have a HR department. So we can't share.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So then, um, garlic phone, which I've never played before is coming in clutch right now.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Um, Amy's currently making a cup of tea at Mercy.

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Um, is just getting a room set up for her.

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Um, because she accidentally nuked her vault of her, the collapse room.

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It was an accident.

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh my God.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This couldn't have gone any worse.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I think that's like pretty on character.

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If someone could insert that meme and put all of her hairs on it and be like, oh, aren't, aren't VTubers cute when they're almost, or a little, almost, a little.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's all I'm going to say. Well, you guys can finish the sentence after that.

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But that was, I can't.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No, I'm kidding.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I was like, okay, I'm going to be honest. When they, when the harem told me they were called harem, I read it as harem.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And I was like, that makes no sense for she be character design.

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I was like, what?

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I have a harem of so many people that are my little, you know, play things and clients and they're my harem and that's hair.

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Which is a rabbit.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But it's not a rabbit.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Hair and rabbit are different.

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But you know what I mean?

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's a pun.

50
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's a pun.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Exactly.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah.

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And they're also called harlots.

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The individuals are harlots or harlots.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Wait, hold on.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I thought you said hairless.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
They're hairless.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Some of them aren't.

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can tell you that.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Check it.

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Marcy, you could.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Do you still have that thumbnail, Marcy?

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Are we good now?

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I got it.

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Almost.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Almost, I mean.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm back with tea.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Marcy, if you still have that thumbnail, if you just throw up the stream.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Is she going to throw up on stream?

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The audience beaming.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It should default to that.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If you just change to the thumbnail and pick our take four.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm literally telling herself the stream was just streaming.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I cannot right now.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
My goodness gracious.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Why are they too loud?

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
How's the volume?

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's my volume.

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Can you hear everyone else?

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Who said the harlots are waxed in my chat?

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The harlots are waxed.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I need them to be clean and proper.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm good.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I see it.

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I see it.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's good.

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's good.

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No.

96
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm not going to.

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000

But yes, the whole premise of the power washer was I was gonna do a gag and be like oh

Vealor isn't doing so well. We might go bust so everyone put a bikini on and get clean in well that I

Flash game where your guy was on like a snowboard. I love that game. Yeah, someone's literally just drawn that

There is whispering some like evil incantations to it

459
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:25,640
This is all I see right now, and I'm not even gonna pretend otherwise. It was definitely zero that drew the ball sack a hundred percent

460
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,680
Why does like why do I feel like this is a lie?

01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,120
Get creative nerds. Jeez. It's not that

01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,160
Okay, miss artists

622
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,920

01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:02,200
Emmy comes at Emmy's like, oh, I'm just gonna draw myself casual and it comes out with like this fucking banger of a commission

624
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,840
It probably costs like $500 to do

625
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:08,360
Oh, yeah, she's like bang that out and I'm like, oh my god

626
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I'm gonna make a vtuber model

627
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,960
Wish I could wish I had a pink a pager durable talent

628
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:27,080
Speaking of that, so it's heavy a fucking marshmallow. They were like, thank you for not tying down your talents

629
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:31,640
To the designs that you assigned them and they can be more themselves and I'm like, yeah

630
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,280
Why would I do that?

631
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:40,520
I was like, I don't know why I feel like it's such a basic things. What the fuck I need drawn out a bleeding heart

632
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,040
Yeah, we're just we're more or so like building upon

633
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:49,880
I tried the characters rather than I have changing everything literally because um

634
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,920
Oh someone rated the vtuber. They were like the only thing that would have been it better

635
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,840
As if you let them design their models like from the start

636
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:03,720
I'm like, bro, it took me a fucking year to get here. Like, oh my god. Give me like a fucking

637
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,120
It takes forever to

638
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:11,160
It is it is not like an overnight rig a vtuber model. Yeah, honestly, right? Who am I?

639
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:15,320
You can ask him. He knows how to do it. I'm gonna run a lot of work

640
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,440
Oh my god

641
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:27,080
Yeah, there's only a select few corpos that will let you do that. Oh, literally it takes so long. Oh, shit. Oh, shit

642
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,320
This is rough

643
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,320
Usually ones that have like artists in

644
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,680
Yeah, we don't

645
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:43,720
If not all of them say first you will have pre

646
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,600
pre-made

647
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:53,720
So it's not actually standard for the people to choose. Yeah, it's really not you

648
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:57,320
That's why it's usually they cast for the roles

649
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,600
What the fuck is that star

650
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,600
Oh

651
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:43,480
Okay, now we have to draw it. Are we ready?

652
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:53,320
I just I have to be ready for it even if I'm not

653
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,920
It's okay

654
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:01,080
Just draw it your way and that's the fun part. Yeah, very nice

655
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,040
I've already forgot which position everyone

656
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:10,040
Oh, this is so bad

657
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:20,120
Sorry, we flinch honestly, I would talk more but this takes so much brain power to do this

658
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,480
I'm so brain dad like I'm fucking done. I'm like

659
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:33,400
I'm reading chat. I'm reading everything, but I'm not responding. I'm so sorry because the everyone's

660
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,840
I'm just really in this

661
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,640
That's far too short so

662
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:56,280
This is why

663
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,840
I don't remember what

664
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,120
Oh

665
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,920
We draw this as fast as we can oh fuck

666
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,960
No, no, no, not like this

667
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,040
Shit, shit, shit. I can't remember what it looked like

668
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,960
Is there supposed to be someone in a pirate boat by the way because I don't think I saw it

669
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,960
That's supposed to be a person in it. I don't know. It's already never already gone

670
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,520
if there's a person

671
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,640
Oh my god

01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,640
Okay, that's that's easy enough

673
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,520
This is enough

674
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:10,280
Okay, gotta go fast gotta go fast

675
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,440
Oh my god, I am so sorry

676
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,800

I mean, that's that's close enough. What if

687
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,440
Oh my god, that was rough enough

688
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,880
That was rough

689
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,200
That's amazing

690
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,880

So I did a little campfire with all of us together

694
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,240
Let's not surprise me

696
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:53,400
Oh, that's so good. At the end of the day, we're all just

697
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,160
Okay, this is good. This stage this stage

698
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,920
Perfect circle

699
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,520
Oh

700
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,500
She's not in jail. She's at the cage

701
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,520
Oh

702
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,160
Wow

703
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,560
One piece I was like

704
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,520
Oh

705
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:53,000
I was like, why is she shooting her piss?

706
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,400
Okay, that's supposed to be me

707
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:05,640
You're giving your big balls the best you need to serve us

708
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,160
The piss will revive him

709
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,440
Oh, the piss will revive you

710
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,440
Oh

711
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:26,920
That was so good, right one more one more

712
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,840
What when have we not done

713
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,920
I don't know

714
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:46,120
I don't remember all the actions are a mystery drawing and sentences are hitting during the game

715
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,920
Which one is this secret

716
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:53,000
Secret seems rough. I've never done that one before

717
01:15:53,720 --> 01:16:00,920
All right, I'm sorry. Mr. Okay. We'll try it. We'll try it. All right last room boys last room. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um

718
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,480
Oh, what I can't see what I'm ready

719
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,760
Oh

720
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,480
Huh

721
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:22,120
Yeah, oh no, wait you run out of freaking words. Oh, bro. I can't erase my sense. I don't know

722
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:37,720
It just appears. Oh, we can't see what we're drawing

723
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,680
Oh

724
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,800
Okay, I don't know I think

725
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,720
I'm gonna just guess

726
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:57,080
What it is where it is. Oh god, that's so funny. What the fuck?

727
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,840
Oh, no, no

728
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:08,200
I'm gonna try to draw. Why is it so hard to draw with the mouse?

729
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:25,640
Can I can I put backwards does it work like that? I didn't give you his legs

730
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,360
Oh

731
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,880
Yeah, um

732
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,680
I used to somewhere there

733
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,920
Okay

734
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,880
Okay

735
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:58,600
Okay, that's a lot all wrong. No

736
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,880
What

737
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,040
Okay

738
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,000
Oh

739
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:24,680
Oh, I don't know what else to draw. That's that's exactly what I drew. I think

740
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:30,760
This is a vain reference. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

741
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,240
Oh

742
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,440

743
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,440
I locked in did I give

744
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:41,800
Wait, I spelled that wrong. Wait. Did I give them bodies? I don't think I gave them bodies. Oh my god

745
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,360
I don't even know where they are

746
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,320
I'm taking a shot in the dark

747
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:53,320
What that is going to be interpreted as and will I stop the creative flow?

748
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,880
Do you

749
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:00,200
No, Amy. Amy's got a hoodie here. Oh sugar. I don't

750
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,840
Fucking I put juice on her

751
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:13,720
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing anymore. I'm fucking dying

752
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:18,600
What what is this? What is this?

753
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,640
It's beautiful. What?

754
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:26,200
Okay, cousin. What is happening? What is this?

755
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:33,080
Someone had a stroke who drew this one. Hope you're feeling okay. Hope you're doing all right. Make sure you hydrate

756
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,640
Oh, fuck. I didn't have enough time to write it

757
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:39,480
Uh, man, how do I even draw this?

758
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,840
This is uh

759
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,080
That's the tongue

760
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,920
And then this is literally everyone

761
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:00,120
This is so difficult. What the fuck am I drawing?

762
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:02,120
I

763
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:14,040
I need like a motion swipes as well and a little arrow to indicate

764
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:22,440
Yeah, there we go. I think I drew it correctly. Well, where is it?

765
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,360
Cute

766
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,920
I need

767
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:37,560
No, my hair my hair. I can't wait to see the end of this. Yeah, that's

768
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:42,920
Something else. This is a great. This is gonna be fucking insane

769
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:49,960
What's going on the ceiling on each row on the ceiling quick? Oh, I think I've dropped something. I don't know boy

770
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,120
Oh, I'm so scared of what these look like

771
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,760
Same

772
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,080

774
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,360
Oh

775
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:44,920
That's why you're humming Indiana Jones. I was like, where did that come from?

776
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,600
I was trying to write cowboy, but I did

777
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,360
Oh

778
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:04,520
Hey, did you draw it in white?

779
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:18,120
And right I used to write as well and orange

780
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:21,080
Oh

781
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,960
Eraser, that's why you can't see it

782
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,120
That potato is really bad never mind

783
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,640
Oh

784
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,680
You learn number one

01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,080
