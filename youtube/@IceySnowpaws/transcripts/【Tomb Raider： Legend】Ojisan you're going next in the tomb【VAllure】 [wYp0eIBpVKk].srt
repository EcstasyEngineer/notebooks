next time i will definitely go to kenapi

80
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,480
earlier because this was really close

81
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,280
yeah so today we're going to be playing tomb raider legend

82
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:07,480
it's one of my most favorite games i love all of the tomb raider games from the very first one

83
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:17,240
and the thing with this game is that i can't remember exactly but i think

84
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:29,720
it it released after angel of darkness if i'm if i'm correct and and back then when tomb raider

85
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:39,000
legend got released it was like really like this big thing because the graphics were like completely

86
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:49,000
like uh different and much more realistic and it was like this really really uh big thing

87
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,200
you know i would like go um i would basically go on forums and stuff like that for tomb raider community

88
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:05,800
and stuff and we would all like post like uh screenshots from the game whenever they would give

89
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:12,760
like an update or a trailer about this game and we would all like talk about it and how cool

90
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:22,680
each area looks and just it was just a whole another time you know um so i really wanted to

91
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,480
um play this game today while you're here because uh it's definitely one of my favorites

92
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:41,560
i really love it because it's also uh for someone like me it's easier than that all the older

93
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:47,400
tomb raider games because it was easier to navigate or like figure out where to go and stuff like

94
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:53,960
that but but yeah yeah yeah i'm gonna stop yapping i'm gonna stop yapping and i am going to

95
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:02,520
uh start the game and when i start the game please let me know if the sound is too loud

96
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,960
let me know if you can see everything and if the sound is too loud or anything i'm gonna have to

97
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:17,080
close the game again because when you try to tap out of this game it just shits itself and

98
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:26,760
freezes so you have to fully close it and reopen it so uh what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna mute the bgm

99
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:38,040
uh i'm gonna set this thing over here for the sound of the game

100
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:49,880
um now let me open the game and then once i'm in the game uh just just let me know if there's

101
00:12:49,880 --> 00:13:00,120
anything you want me to change blah blah blah blah okay hopefully hopefully this works

102
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,200
so

01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:22,680
i see how tired are you um i'm okay i'm okay i'm definitely less tired than i was

649
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:28,600
at the start uh when i started the stream i was very sleepy because i was

650
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:37,160
still waking up from a nappy but the more i'm playing this the more i'm like getting into the game

651
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:44,360
how much did you sleep uh i napped for

652
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:56,120
for two hours i know a lot of you are probably gonna be like i see a nap is not two hours okay

653
01:26:56,120 --> 01:27:03,160
a nap is like 10 minutes maybe 15 but you don't understand for me naps are

654
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:13,000
anywhere from one to three or four hours that's just the way i am okay that's my kind of nap

655
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:19,160
okay i guess we'll go back here

656
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:31,480
ice an app is not two hours i was like 10 minutes maybe 15 while for you maybe for you

657
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:42,840
an app is 15 minutes but for me a polar bear an app can take anywhere between two to four hours

658
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:48,840
and that that's just the way it is for polar bears

659
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:57,960
we don't hibernate so we need to take very long naps in between the day to keep our energy

660
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:04,680
levels up the door might be trapped we're trapped she might be producing hibernation yeah something like

661
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:21,000
that exactly something like that micro dosing hibernation yeah

662
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,320
come on

663
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:39,320
producing all of my strength come on Amanda get out of there i only have limited strength come on

664
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:41,320
come on

665
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:48,520
it's over

666
01:28:51,400 --> 01:29:02,360
nap stream when maybe during asmr sometimes when i do asmr i get really sleepy while i do it

667
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:10,840
so maybe we could have an asmr stream where i do asmr and then in the middle of it in the middle

668
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:17,960
of the stream i nap for a few minutes and you can like listen to my heartbeat or something while i nap

669
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:21,160
i don't know we'll figure it out

670
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:30,520
to be perfectly honest i think this is a terrible idea everyone agreed to leave things as they were

671
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:37,080
i will as much as i can but from what rottland said i'm sure there's a clue down there about what killed my

672
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:44,280
mother i have to go back there's no use trying to enter at this same point it's getting

673
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:51,640
in the river had to get in there somehow i leave you to forget snow bears do asmr for i see

674
01:29:52,360 --> 01:30:02,360
no that that's not what i meant i'm still the one doing the asmr but like when i do asmr it

675
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:09,960
calms me down as well as i do it and then it makes me sleepy as a result the water i hope if you get a call

676
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:14,040
from an eye patch her through straight away i'm a little concerned about leaving her by herself

677
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:23,320
heartbeat asmr forbidden tommy noises oh god please please please don't remind me of tommy noises

678
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:30,440
uh that's you just reminded me one of the things that i hate the most about doing asmr is when

679
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:38,200
my tommy like grumbles or makes sounds it's so embarrassing that's like my least favorite part about

680
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,120
doing asmr

681
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:50,280
okay but what do i do what do i do i um i think i need to use my grenade

682
01:30:53,880 --> 01:31:02,520
no okay i thought i could use my grenade okay maybe that's not the way maybe that's not the way

683
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:07,160
tommy noises are so cute no they're not they're embarrassing

684
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:14,600
i don't want disgusting a decent listen to my tommy making weird sounds that's so gross

685
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,240

01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:36,420
good swimmer but still needs to breathe

729
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:38,420
yeah

730
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:42,420
okay I'm confused as of

731
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:47,420
in what order I need to do this

732
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:51,420
I thought originally there's no order

733
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:54,420
and I'm fine

734
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:58,420
but that doesn't seem to be the case

735
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:07,420
come on, come on

736
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:11,420
come on, come on

737
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:13,420
do I need to do it maybe fast enough?

738
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:16,420
I'm kinda wondering if that's the case

739
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:19,420
do I do it?

740
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:21,420
I do it

741
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:23,420
come on

742
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:27,420
nice! I did it! I did it!

743
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:30,420
okay I just needed to do it really fast

744
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:33,420
I just needed to do it very very fast

745
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:35,420
okay

746
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:39,420
that makes sense

747
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:45,420
okay I made it

748
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:50,420
look at me girl

749
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:53,420
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

750
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:03,420
is that what I think it is?

751
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:05,420
yeah it's a shoe

752
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:07,420
it was Amanda's

753
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:10,420
I doubt so fall off your feet bad easy

754
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:12,420
it's been unlaced

755
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:15,420
I never imagined she could have survived

756
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:18,420
there was a loss of water

757
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:20,420
she still might not have

758
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:27,420
okay we are finally out of the water

759
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:29,420
thank god

760
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:31,420
ah

761
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:37,420
finally out of the water don't need to worry about

762
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:40,420
drowning anymore

763
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:41,420
okay

764
01:37:43,420 --> 01:37:44,420
okay

765
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:49,420
where do I go? I think I go this way

766
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:51,420
I hope

767
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:53,420
okay

768
01:37:56,420 --> 01:37:58,420
it's story time

769
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:01,420
haha

770
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:09,420
hmm my ears

771
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:20,420
do you still find swimming relaxing?

772
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:25,420
yeah when I don't have to go underneath it for too long

773
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:27,420
that's when

774
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:30,420
that's why I do enjoy it

775
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:42,420
when Edamata gave Lara Ice's hair and ears

776
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:44,420
that would be so cool

777
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:47,420
oh my god that would be so cool

778
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:50,420
I think that would be so cute if it was possible

779
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:53,420
oh my god imagine

780
01:38:53,420 --> 01:38:55,420
that would be amazing

781
01:38:55,420 --> 01:38:57,420
oh my face

782
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:07,420
okay where do I go?

783
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:10,420

784
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:13,420
models do you hear me?

785
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:18,420
okay I think I go here

786
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:20,420
and go here

787
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:23,420
and go here

788
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:27,420
okay okay I'm doing good I'm doing good

789
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:30,420
oh no what?

790
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:32,420
why why?

791
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:34,420
why why?

792
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:36,420
why that happen?

793
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:42,420
why did it break? that doesn't make any sense

794
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:47,420
why you break? why you break on me?

795
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:49,420
stupid

796
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:51,420
hmm

797
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:53,420
okay

798
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:54,420
okay

799
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:56,420

801
01:39:58,420 --> 01:40:00,420
I'm begging

802
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:04,420
no no no no no no

803
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:09,420
okay there must be something that I'm doing wrong

804
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:11,420
let's try this again

805
01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:13,420
let's try this again

806
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:15,420
one last time

807
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:18,420
hmm

808
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:21,420
should be possible we need a mother or G sun

809
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:23,420
yeah we do

810
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:26,420
mother or G sun where are you?

811
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:29,420
what the fuck

812
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:33,420
okay I mean

813
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:36,420
what was the point of that?

814
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:38,420
hello?

815
01:40:38,420 --> 01:40:40,420
what's up there?

816
01:40:41,420 --> 01:40:43,420
um okay

817
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:46,420
that seems like it was really pointless

818
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:48,420
can I

819
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:52,420
fuck

820
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:54,420
oh my eye

821
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:02,420

822
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:07,420
can I jump over here?

823
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:11,420

01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:13,420

825
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:16,420

01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:21,420

827
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:22,420

okay I have no idea what was the point of the other one

831
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:32,420

832
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:34,420

01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:19,420
I don't need the binoculars

848
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:21,420
it doesn't help okay

849
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:29,420
okay let's see what do we need to do here

850
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:31,420
I see a lot of balls here

851
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:34,420
so we need to do something with the balls I assume

852
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:39,420
come on G sons I know there's enough balls of you to put in here

853
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:42,420

854
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:44,420

01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:53,420
oh my god it looks like I'm in the rave

858
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:56,420
look it looks like I could DJ here

859
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,420
imagine if I DJ'd in here

860
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:00,420
in these lights that would be so pretty

861
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:02,420
look

862
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:05,420
now I just need like a DJ booth over here

863
01:43:05,420 --> 01:43:08,420
and I could DJ that would be so cool

864
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:13,420
okay

865
01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:16,420

866
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:22,420
how do I get it though

867
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:26,420
okay I'll worry about that later

868
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:29,420
maybe I go up first

869
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:32,420
and figure it out from there

870
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:38,420
I can't jump here

871
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:43,420
where can I jump then

872
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:45,420

01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:20,420

974
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:21,420
okay let's see

975
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:40,420
I don't see a ball over there though

976
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:45,420
is there supposed to be one

977
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:48,420
because I don't see it

978
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:51,420

01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:18,420
I keep losing so much health

987
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:21,420

988
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:27,420

01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:36,420

you don't understand it's not a want

995
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:54,420
it's a need

996
01:51:54,420 --> 01:51:57,420
okay

997
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:02,420
that binoculars doesn't help at all

998
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:06,420
it's the dumbest system they have in this game

999
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:09,420
it's like

1000
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:12,420
if he is like the binoculars in this game

1001
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:15,420
when you're lost and stuff like that

1002
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:17,420
it just goes

1003
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:20,420
oh this is a

1004
01:52:20,420 --> 01:52:23,420
blah blah blah

1005
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:26,420
this is a blah blah blah

1006
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:29,420
yeah it just says what it is

1007
01:52:29,420 --> 01:52:32,420
it doesn't say what to do with it

1008
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:35,420
maybe move the other balls

1009
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:38,420
to other buttons

1010
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:41,420
maybe

1011
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:50,420

exactly what I did just now

1030
01:53:57,420 --> 01:54:00,420
like 30 minutes ago probably

1031
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:03,420

1032
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:06,420

1035
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:15,420

1036
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:18,420

01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:23,420

01:55:30,420 --> 01:55:33,420
that you will have to figure out on your own

1060
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:40,420
very big brain but smooth

1061
01:55:40,420 --> 01:55:43,420

1085
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:35,420

1086
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:38,420

I mean even if I did it wouldn't do much

1149
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:07,420
cause I have like one or two brain cells

1150
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:10,420
