You can see if it's going well today's video, see you in the next video!

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Thank you for watching, bye!

06:00.000 --> 06:08.000
Hello, my sweet and lovely Snow Berries.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
Hello, hello, hello.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
I hope you're doing well today.

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
And if for some reason you're not doing all that great, that's okay.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
That's what I mean if what.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I missed you.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
It's really good to see all of you here.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
Thank you for always keeping me company.

06:40.000 --> 06:58.000
That's very sweet.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
I'm glad the feeling is mutual.

07:05.000 --> 07:16.000
I just wanted to say in advance that last stream I had my big window closed.

07:16.000 --> 07:24.000
And today I have it open so that it won't get too hard, too hot.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I can't talk.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
So it won't get too hot in my room.

07:31.000 --> 07:40.000
However, with that being said, if it's too loud or too distracting,

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
please tell me I want to get upset and I will close the big window.

07:47.000 --> 07:54.000
Because you can literally sometimes hear people walking outside.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
It's crazy.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
This microphone literally picks up everything.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
So please do tell me if it ever gets too loud or too annoying.

08:09.000 --> 08:19.000
Because I want the ASMR to be as comfy as it can be.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Yeah.

08:23.000 --> 08:32.000
Also, I saw a comment on my last ASMR thought that

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
they don't know if I do this intentionally or not.

08:37.000 --> 08:46.000
That I usually focus a lot on one ear and if it was intentional.

08:46.000 --> 08:55.000
So the answer is no, it's not intentional.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
I generally just forget to switch between the ears.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
So if you ever feel that I talk for too long in one ear,

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
don't hesitate to remind me to switch between them.

09:12.000 --> 09:20.000
So that I can make the experience better for you.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Okay.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
You have all been so kind and sweet to me.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
It's been really overwhelming, but not in a bad way.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
Like in a good way, but still overwhelming.

10:15.000 --> 10:22.000
So it's something that I'll have to get used to.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I guess it's very new to me.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
But I don't want to say that I appreciate it so much.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
You've all been so sweet and kind to me.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
And there's really not enough words to express.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Just, I don't know, just so much.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I appreciate it.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
Thank you. You're being all just too kind to me.

10:54.000 --> 11:02.000
I don't know what I did to deserve such nice treatment from you, but

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
I'm glad that you think I'm worth it either way.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
Lots of emotions for a little cutie.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah, I feel my emotions very strongly.

11:29.000 --> 11:37.000
So I apologize if sometimes the things I say sound weird,

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
or we're like, I'm yapping too much.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
I feel like I've been yapping way too much today.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
But at the same time, just I can help it.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
I really want you all to know just how much it means to me.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
But if you like, no matter how many things I write or say,

11:57.000 --> 12:07.000
it's never going to really be enough to truly describe how I feel about all of this.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Thank you.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
I did love you, Ozzy. Good job, yapping too much.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Thank you. How's it going, sir?

12:44.000 --> 13:00.000
I brought some, you stopped today, some additional triggers that I think

13:00.000 --> 13:06.000
could sound potentially good for today's stream.

13:07.000 --> 13:15.000
So one of the things that I brought is a cat toy that I have,

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
and it makes some really, really nice crinkly sounds.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
And I really enjoy sounds like that, so I thought,

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
well, how did I not think about last stream?

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Let's make some nice sounds with it.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Here.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
You have a cat. I have two cats.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Yeah, I have two cats.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Crinkle.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Crinkle.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Crinkle.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
What are your cat's names if you don't mind me asking?

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
One of them is Bucklush.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
And the second one is Potato.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
Bucklush has been really whiny and needy today.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
Like, I initially closed the door and he was like

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
moving with his paws and like whining and stuff.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
But he's okay now.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
He's just super whiny.

15:42.000 --> 15:48.000
So I don't want him to be super loud and whiny in your ears.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
He's a very good boy.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
But really whiny and vocal, but super cute.

16:00.000 --> 16:07.000
And Potato is really tiny and she is this cute funny little gremlin.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
They're both really cute gremlins. I love them both.

16:37.000 --> 16:49.000
This toy also has a soft texture on top of it.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
So when I move it against your ears like this,

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
it can cause fun. It feels soft against the ear.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

17:38.000 --> 17:42.160
oh

17:42.160 --> 17:55.160
okay

17:55.160 --> 17:57.660
was never interested in ASMR

17:57.660 --> 18:00.160
but you make it so comfy

18:00.160 --> 18:03.160
ah, thank you

18:03.160 --> 18:04.160
I'm flattered

18:04.160 --> 18:06.000

I'm doing more than fine, I'm doing amazing, to be honest.

25:59.040 --> 26:04.040
It's been just one week, but it was the best week ever.

26:06.040 --> 26:12.040
I don't know, it's been so crazy, but every day has been genuinely just so great.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.040
I'm sorry, I apologize.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.040
I'm sorry.

26:51.040 --> 26:56.040
I remember how nervous you were before the video.

26:56.040 --> 26:59.040
Yeah, I was extremely nervous.

26:59.040 --> 27:05.040
When I was done with the video, I was legitimately shaking.

27:05.040 --> 27:10.040
My whole body was buzzing and shaking.

27:26.040 --> 27:29.040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28:28.040 --> 28:33.040
I don't know, it feels so real, it feels like a dream.

28:34.040 --> 28:38.040
But it's a dream that became a reality.

28:39.040 --> 28:48.040
It's like that one meme that I saw before I joined the L.R.

28:48.040 --> 28:58.040
And it was like, a girl wakes up one day and realizes she's living her dream.

28:58.040 --> 29:07.040
And that's how I feel, I wake up and I'm like, wow, my dream is amazing.

29:08.040 --> 29:12.040
My reality, that's so magical, you know.

29:12.040 --> 29:16.040
I think it's just so cool.

29:31.040 --> 29:35.040
Let me play around with some other triggers.

29:36.040 --> 29:44.040
It's like a bunch of paper strings or something like that.

29:46.040 --> 29:50.040
So I thought maybe I could try making some sounds with it.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.040
Rather variety.

29:57.040 --> 30:00.040
Some of them are falling out of my hand.

30:00.040 --> 30:05.040
That's probably gonna make a mess, but it's okay.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.040
As long as it makes nice sounds.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.040
Hopefully it does.

30:30.040 --> 30:32.040
I love it when you say mister.

30:34.040 --> 30:39.040
It can help that my mister's are so kind to me and so loving.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.040
Love you mister.

31:00.040 --> 31:19.040
Yeah, this is one of the new triggers, yeah, it is.

31:30.040 --> 31:52.040
Sometimes I feel self-conscious about being older, but you still like me.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.040
Of course I like you, what do you mean?

31:54.040 --> 31:56.040
What do you mean, of course?

31:57.040 --> 32:01.040
And I mean, being older is not a bad thing, I think.

32:02.040 --> 32:05.040
I think that's a nice thing, if anything.

32:09.040 --> 32:15.040
I think being older does add to it in some ways.

32:16.040 --> 32:23.040
But I think it's also about the way your soul is.

32:24.040 --> 32:32.040
Your age could be maybe not older or anything, but you have an old soul, if that makes sense.

32:33.040 --> 32:39.040
So in either scenario, it works.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.040
I love all my mister's.

32:46.040 --> 32:47.040
Okay.

32:47.040 --> 33:12.040
As for the tip that you just mentioned that I missed,

33:12.040 --> 33:20.040
I always read any donations or tips at the end of every stream.

33:21.040 --> 33:26.040
So I will do that towards the end of the stream, don't worry.

33:38.040 --> 33:40.040
I love you mister.

33:43.040 --> 33:56.040
If the spring's a love for me, then I'm gonna put them back for now.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.040
Nice spring's everywhere.

34:05.040 --> 34:09.040
Thank you.

34:10.040 --> 34:14.040
Let me see my comfort rate.

34:15.040 --> 34:21.040
I'm not in the next comfort right now.

34:24.040 --> 34:26.040
Those cables are everywhere.

34:27.040 --> 34:43.040
They have two stones or minerals, whatever you wanna call them.

34:44.040 --> 34:49.040
I thought that they would make for nice sounds.

34:50.040 --> 34:54.040
One of them is blue and the other one is green.

34:55.040 --> 34:59.040
I don't remember what their names are.

35:00.040 --> 35:02.040
I'm too down to remember.

35:03.040 --> 35:05.040
My memory is pretty bad.

35:06.040 --> 35:13.040
But I hope you will like the sounds that they make together.

35:24.040 --> 35:26.040
Thank you.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.040
Thank you.

36:25.040 --> 36:26.040
Thank you.

36:26.040 --> 36:55.040
Do you really make me crave for cuddles that way?

36:56.040 --> 37:00.040
Here I'm gonna get some hugs and cuddles today.

37:02.040 --> 37:04.040
Just like last week.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.040
Sorry for muting.

37:30.040 --> 37:33.040
My throat felt scratchy and I had to cough.

37:56.040 --> 38:05.040
No worries, I'm not sick.

38:06.040 --> 38:11.040
My throat just felt itchy or scratchy for some reason.

38:12.040 --> 38:15.040
So I had to cough it up basically.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.040
I'm glad you do.

38:18.040 --> 38:33.040
Don't hesitate to ask for previous triggers that I have already done during this stream.

38:34.040 --> 38:37.040
If you want to hear more of them, that's completely fine.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.040
Thank you very much.

39:15.040 --> 39:26.040
Can I bring back the tippy tabs?

39:27.040 --> 39:30.040
Yes, we can definitely do that.

39:45.040 --> 40:15.040

so the police is looking for them, but it's okay

41:14.020 --> 41:16.020
you're safe here with me

41:21.020 --> 41:23.020
gotta do what you gotta do

41:24.020 --> 41:27.020
if you misbehave, I must use the buzzer

41:28.020 --> 41:30.020
and the police will be looking for you

41:30.020 --> 41:32.020
so if you hear police in the background

41:32.020 --> 41:34.020
you know why

41:35.020 --> 41:39.020
they're looking for misbehaving snow bears

41:40.020 --> 41:42.020

46:39.660 --> 46:40.820
Can I get a verse again?

46:40.820 --> 47:10.820
I don't blame you, this has been me, like every day, like I feel butterflies somewhat lately with just how loving and sweet mister is to me, I admit sometimes there's moments where like even one

47:10.820 --> 47:39.820
to maybe call you Dada or you know other stuff but I guess really embarrassed about it and shy and I also don't want to make it weird so for now I just stick to ojizan and mister and you know snow pairing but sometimes I have like I just do all you boy other stuff too but

47:40.820 --> 47:57.820
I hold myself back because I get really shy and embarrassed so maybe at some point I will but I'm really embarrassed right now

47:57.820 --> 48:17.820
for now it's gonna be like this but I just wanted to tell you about it just to you know let it out and tell you how I felt

48:28.820 --> 48:43.820
is there any pet names you like, like cutie or kitten or darling?

48:44.820 --> 48:55.820
I really like just having the word little at it so let me like little icy, it's cute

48:57.820 --> 48:59.820
I think it's cute doesn't it?

49:00.820 --> 49:01.820
just um

49:08.820 --> 49:09.820
oh god

49:11.820 --> 49:18.820
I feel that's like one of my big favorites, darling is good as well, darling is cute too

49:22.820 --> 49:24.820
or baby icy

49:25.820 --> 49:34.820
I don't know why I just embarrassed about it but I'm like all blushing right now

49:48.820 --> 49:51.820
icy little boys, it's really cute

49:54.820 --> 49:55.820
it's really cute

50:07.820 --> 50:08.820
you're my baby darling

50:11.820 --> 50:12.820
that's really cute

50:16.820 --> 50:20.820
so I'm getting really flustered

50:25.820 --> 50:32.820
I have a small box here and it has something in it but

50:33.820 --> 50:42.820
but I don't know if I should do anything about it

50:43.820 --> 50:45.820
but it's really cute

50:46.820 --> 50:53.820
I have a small box here and it has something in it

50:53.820 --> 50:54.820
but

50:59.820 --> 51:05.820
but I don't know if I should do any like triggers or anything with it

51:10.820 --> 51:12.820
I feel embarrassed

51:14.820 --> 51:16.820
but can you guess what it is?

51:18.820 --> 51:19.820
what's in the box?

51:23.820 --> 51:24.820
what's in the box?

51:38.820 --> 51:39.820
is it toy?

51:40.820 --> 51:44.820
not necessarily no, I wouldn't really say it's a toy no

51:47.820 --> 51:49.820
yes, a best find

51:50.820 --> 51:52.820
how did you know?

51:53.820 --> 51:55.820
how did you know what the egg?

51:59.820 --> 52:08.820
it has a really cute pacifier that one of my masters got me from the farm

52:10.820 --> 52:16.820
so I've been wondering if I should use it as a striker or something like that

52:17.820 --> 52:23.820
but I don't know if that would be like really weird or if it's, I don't know

52:23.820 --> 52:26.820
I just feel really shy the best

52:27.820 --> 52:28.820
ah

52:41.820 --> 52:44.820
I already said no, I'm sorry

52:45.820 --> 52:47.820
but I'm shy

52:48.820 --> 52:51.820
I really am embarrassed

52:51.820 --> 52:53.820
I don't know

52:54.820 --> 52:56.820
I don't know

53:01.820 --> 53:06.820
it would be funny if I have the best seat and I try to talk

53:07.820 --> 53:09.820
I think that would be funny

53:11.820 --> 53:13.820
without opening it

53:14.820 --> 53:16.820
it's not a way to make it weird

53:16.820 --> 53:18.820
but I'm sorry ok, I'm really embarrassed

53:24.820 --> 53:26.820
I don't know, I'm so embarrassed

53:26.820 --> 53:28.820
I don't know

53:29.820 --> 53:31.820
oh, it's so cute though

53:32.820 --> 53:34.820
it's so cute though

53:34.820 --> 53:41.820
it has a moon and a polar bear with a heart and ribbons

53:41.820 --> 53:44.820
and it is cute on it

53:44.820 --> 53:47.820
and it has like a candy

53:48.820 --> 53:50.820
like stuff and like

53:51.820 --> 53:55.820
like lots of like shiny sparkly things on it

53:56.820 --> 54:00.820
and it's really really cute

54:12.820 --> 54:15.820
I really love the way that it looks, it's so freaking cute

54:21.820 --> 54:22.820
ah

54:31.820 --> 54:35.820
I'm kinda wondering if I could maybe

54:35.820 --> 54:38.820
actually like take a picture of it

54:38.820 --> 54:40.820
and then cut it out

54:40.820 --> 54:45.820
and use it like as an on-stream asset

54:45.820 --> 54:51.820
basically have it used on my model as well

54:52.820 --> 54:54.820
I think that would be really cute

54:56.820 --> 54:59.820
and more immersive maybe

54:59.820 --> 55:01.820
I don't know

55:08.820 --> 55:11.820
like a toggle, yeah, something like that

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:51.000
I'm trying to remember what other triggers I did last time.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
But my memory is so bad.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I didn't know that I can remember if there was more stuff that I did last time.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:11.000
I don't know if I remember what other triggers I did last time.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.000
But I don't know if I remember what other triggers I did last time.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I don't know if I remember what other triggers I did last time.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
But yeah, that's true. I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Not yesterday, but last time somewhere strange.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I was tapping the microphone yesterday.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:41.000
I remember when I heard this trigger for the first time that someone was scratching against the radio mic.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I felt so many details. It was crazy.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:55.000
It really sucks how rarely I get tingles now.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:07.000
In the first year or two that I got into ASMR, I got tingles so often and so much of it.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
But it's really rare now.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Can I try saying coconut?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Okay.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Coconut.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Coconut.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Coconut.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Yeah, you just said that the sun is nice.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Yeah, it's sad really.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I still get tingles here and there but it's rare and it makes me sad.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Because it feels so nice.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Oh, I know. Maybe this will make a good sound. It's like a sticker.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Oh, I know. Maybe this will make a good sound. It's like a sticker.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Or maybe not. Maybe I'm just stupid.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I don't know if that sounds good or not. I can't tell.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:23.000
It's so cute with these tumbles over her words.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:31.000
It's almost just really hard for her to say no.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Okay, how are we feeling about this sticker trigger?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Is it any good? Or is it like, man, whatever?

01:09:47.000 --> 01:10:03.000
It's like, man, I wish it was more sticky.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Maybe mister can help me make this sticker more sticky.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:37.000
What about this sound?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Is this any good?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:11:05.000
I don't know where it pleases you but I want to please mister. That's important.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Maybe with some kind of tape.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:15.000
There are bits to gear. I would try that.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Okay, let's start with the other ear.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I don't know if I can see them better.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000
We are not decent anymore, mister. You're both.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:55.000
It just depends on what I feel like calling you in the moment.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.000
That's really weird. I feel like this sticker doesn't really stick much in this ear.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Because it sounded a lot better in the other ear. More sticky.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I think it is a spaghetti. Spaghetti. Spaghetti.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I don't think I feel safe putting this sticker anywhere near my skin if you know what I mean.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Okay, let's start with the other ear.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Okay, let's start with the other ear.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Okay, let's start with the other ear.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Okay, let's start with the other ear.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Okay.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Okay.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Yes, yes, yes.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Okay, let's start with the other ear.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Yes, yes, yes.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Yes, yes, yes.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:17:09.000
I love you.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:21.000
I had bubble wrap like a few weeks ago, but I don't have it anymore.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:43.000
But I promise whenever I do get bubble wrap in any of my packages, I'll be sure to save it and use it as a trigger for my ASMR streams.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Yes, yes, yes.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Yes, yes, yes.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Yes, yes, yes.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I'm going to do a little bit of sniffing since I did the last stream as well.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Sniffing.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:20:09.000
What is sniffing so happily? You, of course, silly.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Sniffing.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:43.000
The smell of a snow fairy. My favorite.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:21:09.000
You stink very nice.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
My favorite smell.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Sniffing.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Sniffing.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Sniffing.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Sniffing.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Sniffing.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Sniffing.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Sniffing.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Sniffing.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Sniffing.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Sniffing.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Let me give you a hug. I think you deserve a nice warm hug. Come here.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Come here, my beloved. You deserve some nice nice hugs to get you feel relaxed and loved and nice.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Sniffing.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:21.000
I love you, snow fairy. So, so much.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:45.000
You deserve all the hugs in the world. You deserve to get some nice warm cuddles after a hard day of work.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Snow fairy has been working so hard for me. It's so sweet, aren't you? The sweetest in the world. I love you so, so much.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I love you.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:45.000
It feels nice cuddling you like this. So nice and comfy.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Wishing I could clone herself like she tweeted so I could have icy hugs for real. We all need an icy. I feel the same.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:11.000
It makes me sad when I think about it too deeply. I try not to overthink it, but I don't know. I gotta help with it today.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:25.000
And I just felt like really sad and was like, man, if I could clone myself for this reason, I would.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Would you cuddle with your clone self? No, that would be weird.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Would you make us happy if that's all that matters? Yeah, but I want to make you even happier, you know?

01:27:51.000 --> 01:28:07.000
And I think about it like, I still feel like I want to be able to make you happier, but like I also, I don't know, just makes me a little sad, I guess.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:19.000
But I should stop thinking about it and enjoy what we have.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:25.000
That question would you cuddle with your model if it was real?

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:40.000
I don't know how to answer this question because my model is me, you know? Like I see is me and I am icy, you know?

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:57.000
So, I don't even know how to answer this question because it's literally me. It's literally me, so like, I don't know how to answer it.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:16.000
I think we already are happy. Then offer to yourself for a sake, okay? I'll try. I'll try.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I'll offer my best to you to make you as happy as I can within my ability.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Have you enjoyed that nice cuddle we had? I know I did.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Let's stay out with you, Rocky, during the stream. I mean, then do you...

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:25.000
As always. Like I said, during summer, when it's hot, I just wear panties. That's it.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:34.000
What color?

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:44.000
I posted it on my old Twitter, actually. A picture of the panties. I posted it on my old Twitter.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Some of you probably have seen it. Nothing else. Yeah, nothing else.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:31:08.000
I feel like that's normal for me, anyways. Like, it's summer, but while they wear anything else, I'm in my own space, I'm not outside or anything.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I'm not gonna get a cold, the weather is hot.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I don't wear socks around. I wear slippers. Have, like, really cute reindeer slippers that I wear around the house. They very soft and comfy to wear.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Let me know what you think of this sound. Is it any good or not?

01:32:35.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Yeah, it's good.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:33.000
I feel like I really need some time to establish myself and get into the growth of things, especially now that I'm overwhelmed with all the support and attention I've been getting in the future.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Maybe, I don't know, it might happen if it depends how I feel a while from now.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Can we get some cows later? Yeah, yeah, of course, definitely.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:06.000
I don't feel pressured to do anything you're not ready for. Yeah, thank you for understanding. I definitely only want to do stuff that I feel comfortable doing.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:23.000
But, you know, it doesn't mean it will never happen. Like, there's always the possibility that something's gonna happen. You live and you see what happens.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Wait, Ben, there's only no bra. I don't need a bra.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:22.000
I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:47.000
I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra. I don't need a bra.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:36:00.000
As I plan to be an ASMR tomorrow as well or on Thursday tomorrow, there will be another ASMR stream tomorrow as well. Back to back.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:46.000
ASMR. Thank you.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:52.000
I just sleep in bed naked. No, not fully naked. Just with my panties.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:10.000
But yeah, I feel like ASMR streams are definitely very nice for the days where I don't really feel like playing anything, you know?

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:27.000
And I just want to in bed and just relax together with you and just be comfy together, comfy quality. I can't talk. Comfy, quality time together.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:47.000
I see do you play any instruments? No, I don't. I used to have a kalimba, a small one.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:59.000
And I used to use a Disney smart trigger and play it sometimes, but I never played any actual songs or anything like that.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:18.000
I just randomly pressed it in whatever sounded good to me, I guess. I freestyled the kalimba because that's how I enjoyed doing it the most.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:45.000
What's your favorite ASMR trigger? I actually really love visual ASMR triggers, so I really enjoy triggers where there's like hand movements or bright lights and stuff like that.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Combined with whispers, there's something really calming about it. I just used to play piano. Oh, that's so cool. That's really nice.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:15.000
That makes me think of a memory that I have. I remember when I was a little younger, I had a friend and me and her would sometimes go to the mall together.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:31.000
And the mall had this big piano store. And in the piano store, they had actually headphones plugged into the piano so you could sit and play it.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:51.000
And obviously, I don't know how to play the piano, but I would sometimes go to that store, sit and just make up my own melodies for like a while.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Sometimes I would sit there for like 20 minutes or something because it was just like a really fun thing to do.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Sculpt massage is 10 out of 10. Actually, I think I might be able to do a sculpt massage. I have a wig, so I think if I put the wig on the 3DO and I scratched the top of it, maybe it would feel or sound like head scratches.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I would say I hope so.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Maybe you just will have to pick a piano again, learn a song for you.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Oh, that's so sweet. That's really sweet.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:03.000
I don't know why it makes me want to peer up, but I think that's really sweet. Thank you.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Can you try hair brushing with it, too? It's such a very trigger brush, so comfy.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Do you mean like get a hair brush and brush the wig hair? Is that what you mean?

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Because yeah, definitely something that I would do. I think that would be really nice.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Let's see. I have some scissors here. I want to see if it would make for good sounds. So let me know what you think.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Snip, snip, snip, snip. Don't worry. I'm always snipping away the dead ends, so your hair...

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Fuck, I can't talk because that's so stupid. So your hair can grow healthy.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:53.000
You know what else I like to do? Sometimes I like to use scissors for ASMR, but not for hair cutting.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:14.000
For cutting away negative energy. So if snowberries are feeling a bit down or tired, I'm going to snip it all away, and you're going to feel much better after it.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:23.000
I know it sounds kind of silly, but I like to think of it that way sometimes.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Lemonade audio for your decent. I mean, yeah, I could, but I guess my thought pattern about it is like, well, I've already made two of them,

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000
so I feel like if I make a third one, then it's boring.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Like, I don't know what would make it better.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:23.000
I don't want to just upload a bunch of lemonade sounds every day because I mean, that's just going to be boring.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:33.000
I think I'm going to get cat noises, meow somewhere, meow.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Wait, you did too? Yeah, I did too. If you go through my media, you will find the second one or just scroll down.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:06.000
It's not boring, just boost up what you're doing at the time, doing a random stream.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Maybe, maybe I'll do that. Maybe I'll do that.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snipe, snip

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Snipe, snipe, snipe, snipe, snip, snip, snipe, snip, snip, snip

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:54.640
All right, someone asked if I can do some yawing or yaw sounds.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:47.000
yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, y

01:47:47.000 --> 01:48:05.280
yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw,

01:48:35.280 --> 01:49:05.280
ха-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-а-

01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:35.280
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

01:49:35.280 --> 01:50:04.280
Because I feel bad if when I raid, if there's people that are asleep, or are really comfy, will get like jump scared, and I don't want that, and I did raid Stranny last days in my stream, but I don't know how.

01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:15.280
How you feel? I guess I feel bad for the people that might get jump scared, cause I don't know.

01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:42.280
I don't know. I'll try to duck louder towards the end of the stream, like last ASMR stream.

01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:57.280
What is Mano raid? I don't know what that is. Oh no, it's people talking outside.

01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:11.280
Sorry, people talking outside.

01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:33.280
I don't know. I would feel like too shy to raid anyone else. That's not my gen mates, so there's bad too.

01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:44.280
I mostly just keep to myself, and I'm only more comfy around my gen mates.

01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:54.280
But I will talk a bit louder, or let no one advance towards the end of the stream like I did.

01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:58.280
Anyways, let me drink some water.

01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:32.280
I'm too shy for that. I'm really bad with initiating with the people.

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:42.280
And even with my gen mates, a lot of times I don't initiate conversations. Just how my brain is, I guess.

01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:52.280
I say can you try finger flattering? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's do some finger flattering.

01:53:33.280 --> 01:54:02.280
What the fuck is that question? What? What is the power of something so what?

01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:12.280
I'm sorry, but I have literally no idea what that question means. I literally do not understand what.

01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:25.280
I don't know what this word means either.

01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:45.280
I'm sorry, I don't know. I have no idea what this is. I've never seen that meme, so I don't know.

01:54:46.280 --> 01:55:01.280
The biology meme? Well, I'm just stupid, so you can't give me memes about any science or biology or any of that, because I'm just a baby.

01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:08.280
I'm just a little baby. I don't know what any of that stuff.

01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:36.280
The only biology you need to know is what it is that you just see personally.

01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:42.280
True, that all that really matters, I agree.

01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:09.280
I'm sorry.

01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:39.280
I'm sorry.

01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:41.280
I'm sorry.

01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:06.280
I'm sorry.

01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:12.280
I'm sorry.

01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:32.280
I'm sorry, because I have a death in my mouth. That's why I'm sorry.

01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:41.280
I'm sorry.

01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:43.280
I'm sorry.

01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:08.280
I love you so much.

01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:12.280
I love you so very much.

01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:14.280
I love you so very much.

01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:32.280
I love you so very much.

01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:46.280
I love you so very much.

01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:48.280
I love you so very much.

01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:03.280
I love you so very much.

01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:15.280
I love you so very much.

01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:35.280
I love you so very much.

01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:44.280
I love you so very much.

01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:58.280
I love you so very much.

02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:14.280
I love you so very much.

02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:24.280
I'm so embarrassed.

02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:31.280
Someone said I sound like a nerd.

02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:38.280
I know it's your way.

02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:46.280
Snow bears would hate me now because it sounds like a nerd.

02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:49.280
When I have my passion, you aren't the one.

02:00:56.280 --> 02:01:00.280
I want to sound cute, but if I don't sound cute,

02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:04.280
when I use the pacifier, I won't use it.

02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:17.280
Snow bears would hate me now because it sounds like a nerd.

02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:30.280
I love you so very much.

02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:44.280
I love you so very much.

02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:52.280
I love you so very much.

02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:15.280
I love you so very much.

02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:44.280
I love you so very much.

02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:01.280
I love you so very much.

02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:11.280
I love you so very much.

02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:17.280
Even if the fart gets taken down,

02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:20.280
if someone archives this stream,

02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:26.280
I will tweet the link to the archive.

02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:30.280
Just don't worry.

02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:45.280
I love you so very much.

02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:51.280
I love you so very much.

02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:53.280
I love you so very much.

02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:14.280
I love you so very much.

02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:39.280
I love you so very much.

02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:44.280
I'm very joy with

02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:48.280
the little magic tub.

02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:50.280
Oh no.

02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:52.280
It's so much fun.

02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:54.280
Shut up.

02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:56.280
I'm the only baby here.

02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:05.280
I'm the only baby.

02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:07.280
Shut up.

02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:10.280
I'm the only baby here.

02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:15.280
I'm the only baby here.

02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:29.280
I'm the only baby here.

02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:33.280
No.

02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:34.280
Ew.

02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:36.280
No.

02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:38.280
It's from the outside.

02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:40.280
I told you.

02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:42.280
It's from the outside.

02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:45.280
Because my mic picks up everything from the outside.

02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:47.280
Ew.

02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:48.280
I don't have kids.

02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:51.280
No.

02:05:52.280 --> 02:05:54.280
It's from the outside.

02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:57.280
I'm the only baby here.

02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:00.280
I'm the only baby here.

02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:10.280
No.

02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:12.280
I'm the only kid.

02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:14.280
I wouldn't want kids.

02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:16.280
When I'm the kid.

02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:22.280
I want all these things to give all the attention to me forever.

02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:26.280
All attention on me.

02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:28.280
And me only.

02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:40.280
Mm-hmm.

02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:48.280
It's the best thing to do.

02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:51.280
That's what I am.

02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:10.280
No.

02:07:10.280 --> 02:07:11.280
No.

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:12.280
No.

02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:37.280
No.

02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:38.280
No nothing.
