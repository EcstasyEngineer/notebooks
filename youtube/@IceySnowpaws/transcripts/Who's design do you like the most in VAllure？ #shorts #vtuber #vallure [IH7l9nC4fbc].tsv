0	4160	All six VLR designs have been revealed, including myself.
4160	8480	It's not traditional for an agency to have six talents for one generation,
8480	11760	but the development team said, and I quote,
11760	15440	there should be one design you naturally gravitate towards.
15440	17200	So, who do you like the most?
17200	18240	Is it Icy?
19520	22320	The insomniac polar bear with scars?
22320	27440	Any the Hexmaniac of the group and the only one of us with a tattoo?
27520	32320	Strony the hypnotizing cuttlefish that's also siren, but can't sing.
34320	39760	Mercy the love-struck yonder, but can't seem to ever love right.
39760	45120	She be the bunny-milk who likes to work hard, but play harder.
45120	48640	And last but certainly not least,
48640	54800	Ezra the goat goddess with milkers bigger than your b**ch.
