07:18.300 --> 07:32.400

The mom stream man's always wants to see you again.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.400
That's really sweet.

08:26.400 --> 08:32.400
When I end the stream, I miss you too, to be honest.

08:32.400 --> 08:42.400
That's why I don't know you have so much on Twitter because I miss you.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.400
I want to give you some kisses.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.400
I miss you so much.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.400
I miss you so much.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.400
I miss you so much.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.400
I miss you so much.

09:55.400 --> 09:59.400
It's nice to get up from work and calm down with your ASMR.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.400
Thank you.

10:01.400 --> 10:05.400
I'm glad I can calm you down and get you all relaxed.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.400
I love your kisses.

10:10.400 --> 10:14.400
I love giving those kisses to you.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.400
That works perfectly, doesn't it?

10:30.400 --> 10:36.400
I think I'm gonna melt her a mystery before they can start his day, but that's okay.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.400
I'll be a bottle full for my cup.

10:38.400 --> 10:56.400
I mean, this is kind of embarrassing, but to be honest, I felt like a bottle the whole day today.

10:57.400 --> 11:14.400
It's like I read your messages and you know, some of the other snappies sent me and it makes me feel a lot of feelings and stuff.

11:17.400 --> 11:23.400
So I've been kind of like a bottle that's been feeling like butterflies all day.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.400
I didn't make a bottle.

11:26.400 --> 11:36.400
I mean, I kind of did, but that's embarrassing.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.400
I hope you are too overwhelmed.

11:54.400 --> 12:03.400
I'm definitely overwhelmed, but I don't think it's gotten to a bad point.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.400
Does that make sense?

12:06.400 --> 12:11.400
It's overwhelmed, but in a good way, you know, overwhelmed.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.400
How would I describe it?

12:17.400 --> 12:22.400
Basically overflowing with happiness and good feelings.

12:24.400 --> 12:29.400
So I'm not like feeling bad.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.400
So it's all okay.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.400
The strong feelings can be overwhelming.

12:45.400 --> 12:53.400
Yeah, especially when you're like me, someone who feels their emotions extra strong.

12:55.400 --> 13:00.400
And it's like just like a whole wave taking a hold of me.

13:01.400 --> 13:15.400
Overflowing with our love and loving.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.400
Yes.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.400
Very true.

13:22.400 --> 13:29.400
I know you're strong, got emptied out, people really love you.

13:29.400 --> 13:37.400
Yeah, I still don't know what I did to deserve it, to be honest.

13:37.400 --> 13:43.400
Like when it happened, I thought I was like half asleep or something.

13:44.400 --> 13:52.400
It was just, I was like, I don't know, it's like really nice.

13:52.400 --> 14:07.400
But at the same time, I feel like a little bad because I feel like super spoiled and like I really didn't do all the much to deserve it or anything like that.

14:14.400 --> 14:23.400
Can you add more to your surround so we can get you more stuff?

14:27.400 --> 14:28.400
I don't know.

14:29.400 --> 14:35.400
I feel really bad, like I feel really, really spoiled, rotten.

14:36.400 --> 14:48.400
I feel bad if I'm gonna like add more stuff, you know, cause like it just got emptied and I don't know.

14:48.400 --> 14:56.400
I'm gonna feel like, I don't know, like a bad person and like greedy if I put more stuff.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.400
You know what I mean?

15:06.400 --> 15:17.400
Thank you for everything. No, thank you for everything. You've done so much for me. You've opened so kind to me.

15:17.400 --> 15:41.400
But we want to spoil, but I feel so bad. I feel like, I don't know, I don't know, it's like a mental thing I guess.

15:41.400 --> 15:59.400
Like it's really weird, like it's really nice, you know, it's sweet to be this spoiled, but it's like when it happens, you know, and then you see it happen, it's like, oh no, I feel so bad.

15:59.400 --> 16:14.400
I don't know, you're telling me like not to feel bad about it and that you genuinely want me, that you genuinely want to spoil me and stuff, and I find that very sweet.

16:15.400 --> 16:31.400
But for now at least, I don't know if I'm gonna add more stuff, just cause like it just got emptied, you know, and it just feel really greedy like instantly putting more stuff on it.

16:32.400 --> 16:43.400
I don't know, okay, maybe this is extreme, but if like, you know, my wish list got emptied and I put more stuff on it right away, I would feel like a bitch.

16:44.400 --> 16:59.400
And that's, maybe it sounds like extreme, but like in my head it's like, wow what a fucking bitch, she just got like her entire wish list like cleared and she's adding more, what the fuck is her problem?

17:00.400 --> 17:16.400
You know, like that's how my brain works, I'm like, no, like maybe after a while, you know, but alright now I guess, cause I would feel pretty bad.

17:17.400 --> 17:27.400
It's okay to set stuff when you feel like it, yeah, exactly.

17:32.400 --> 17:37.400
Are you holding onto a pillow or an arm? It's a pillow.

17:38.400 --> 17:45.400
Think about it like this, a jesus on Thursday and every day is Christmas.

17:47.400 --> 17:56.400
But I don't know if I've been such a good girl every single day that I deserve for it to be Christmas every day, you know.

18:07.400 --> 18:25.400
I don't have a chimney though, so that wouldn't work.

18:26.400 --> 18:43.400
I guess when you're monetized people can spoil you then, I suppose, if they want to, you know, there's no pressure.

18:44.400 --> 19:10.400
Speaking of that, speaking of being monetized and stuff, I'm actually monetized and this Saturday at 6pm CET, like the same time that I always start my streams, I will have two different streams in the same day,

19:10.400 --> 19:33.400
so basically at my usual time when I start, it will be monetization and membership celebration and I know it's not all that interactive or maybe sounds all that much fun,

19:33.400 --> 20:02.400
but I really want to watch Blade Runner 4029, I think it's the number, but my memory is really bad, but that's what I want to do and then after that, after that there will be a drunk,

20:03.400 --> 20:17.400
karaoke stream for members only, so anyone who is a member will be able to join it and it will happen once we're finished watching the movie.

20:18.400 --> 20:41.400
Also, another thing I feel like the best thing would be is to thank all the people that join a membership to thank all of you at the end of the karaoke stream so that I don't do it in the middle of us watching the movie, I guess, so it's not too destructive,

20:42.400 --> 20:51.400
but at the end of the karaoke stream, I will thank each and every person who joined.

20:51.400 --> 21:20.400
I'm not a good singer, but I'm definitely not a good singer, I just think for fun, not cause I'm good at it or anything.

21:21.400 --> 21:43.400
And then drunk and karaoke sounds like a perfect night with IC, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm really excited because that means that on Saturday we will be spending extra time together, usually, you know, I stream two hours, so I will spend like maybe four hours on Saturday.

21:52.400 --> 22:03.400
I'm also sorry for you having so much, there's just a lot to talk about today at the start of the stream anyways.

22:08.400 --> 22:14.400
You're singing during the DJ stream was cute. Thank you, thank you.

22:15.400 --> 22:24.400
Oh, you see, Donkey Kong wanted to thank donors and stuff from yesterday through. Thank you for reminding me. My memory is so fucking bad.

22:25.400 --> 22:30.400
Thank you for reminding me. I almost forgot us.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.400
Let me get closer to my screen.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.400
Okay, so during the DJ stream.

22:51.400 --> 22:58.400
Oh, thank you very, very much for the $100 tip. Holy shit.

23:00.400 --> 23:05.400
That's a lot. Why did you do that? But thank you. I really appreciate it.

23:06.400 --> 23:14.400
Your DJ stream is blessed. Thank you. I'm glad you enjoyed the DJ stream. I had plenty of fun.

23:15.400 --> 23:28.400
And thank you Anonymous for the $5 tip. There was no message attached to this one, but thank you for supporting me. I appreciate it.

23:36.400 --> 23:43.400
We love the herbs. I'm glad. I'm glad you do.

23:50.400 --> 23:56.400
It's not like that every streamer just wanted to get those stuff out of the way.

24:06.400 --> 24:21.400
The DJ stream was big. Thank you. I'm glad you think so. I genuinely had so much fun. And I'm so excited to do another one. It's just so much fun, you know. It was amazing.

24:22.400 --> 24:36.400
The DJ was so damn fun. Only downside was me drinking shitty dry gin. Well, next time you get a nice drink so you can enjoy the stream even more. Okay?

24:36.400 --> 25:01.400
I really liked your eyes wings if it's all around you. Right? I thought it looked so freaking cute too. It was like perfect cute outfit for me.

25:06.400 --> 25:22.400
But yeah, I'm genuinely excited for another DJ stream. I had a total blast. I just had so much fun the entire time. There was no dull moment.

25:36.400 --> 25:46.400
It was so much fun. I'm so excited to do another one. I'm so excited to do another one.

25:46.400 --> 26:01.400
I'm so excited to do another one. I'm so excited to do another one. I'm so excited to do another one.

26:01.400 --> 26:11.400
I'm so excited to do another one. I'm so excited to do another one. I'm so excited to do another one.

26:31.400 --> 26:58.400
By the way, I just remembered there was another thing. I was initially just gonna write it on Twitter, but I feel like I might as well bring it up here, I think, except that I don't know how to talk about it without feeling all shy about it. I'm embarrassed.

27:01.400 --> 27:27.400
So, you know how earlier I was talking about Maros and all the sweet stuff you sent me and all your kind of loving words and you know, the lustful Maros?

27:32.400 --> 27:57.400
So, I don't know if anyone knows that, but if you ever want to send another one, obviously to me only, I don't want those things from people who send it to multiple girls.

27:58.400 --> 28:22.400
But if you know you know basically, say if you've already sent it before and you want to send it again only to me, cause you love me, then don't feel bad about sending it again, like if you want to.

28:23.400 --> 28:40.400
You know what I mean? So, if you want to make another one, show me how in love you are with me and show how much love you have pouring out of you.

28:41.400 --> 28:56.400
I think that's really sweet if you send it again, like don't feel bad that like, oh it's the same person or it's more like, oh it's me again, like you can send it again, you know?

28:57.400 --> 29:16.400
I give all my love to you, I see, thank you, I find that extremely sweet and romantic, so thank you.

29:17.400 --> 29:31.400
But yeah, sorry, if it's not weird, I just get really shy talking about the stuff out loud like this.

29:32.400 --> 29:57.400
But yeah, I only accept them again from the misters who love me, so please don't send me any if you send them to the other girls as well.

29:57.400 --> 30:13.400
Cause the way that I see it, it's a way for us to be intimate, you know, and special together, you know, it's like, I don't know, that's just how I see it I guess.

30:14.400 --> 30:33.400
So if you go and do it and send it like to another girl, it will make me sad, you know, it will make me genuinely sad and I don't want to be sad, so just avoid sending it all together to me in that case, you know?

30:33.400 --> 30:35.400
I hope that makes sense.

30:35.400 --> 30:48.400
I'll never send one to anyone else, I see it's my one and only. Thank you, I'm glad.

31:06.400 --> 31:31.400
So can we send one to you that's made only for you because I want to love all of you? Wait, what do you mean? I'm a bit confused with the last part of the question.

31:32.400 --> 31:44.400
You're the only person I've ever sent to a video. I'm glad that it makes me feel, I don't know, really special and happy as well.

31:45.400 --> 31:54.400
I'm actually happy you spoke about it instead of keeping quiet and holding it in. Thanks for telling us your feelings.

31:55.400 --> 32:13.400
Yeah, I just, I feel like I should be honest with how things make me feel because, you know, if something makes me sad, then I'm clearly not going to enjoy it.

32:13.400 --> 32:37.400
You know, if I get, like, a tribute and then, like, it wasn't sent just to me or because Mr. loves only me, then, you know, that's gonna make me sad because I feel it as something special and, like, intimate between us.

32:37.400 --> 32:54.400
And if you don't see it the same way, then I don't want it, you know? Like, there's just, I don't get anything, like, from it like it doesn't make me feel happy or good or anything.

32:54.400 --> 33:15.400
So that's why I thought that I should, like, address it so that, you know, I can be happy and those who love me can, you know, get to share special moments like that with me.

33:24.400 --> 33:30.400
Thank you very much.

33:54.400 --> 33:59.400
Can we get one round? Because we have a condition update.

33:59.400 --> 34:21.400
It's been pretty nice today. The wind has been cold for the most part of the day, starting out right now, but that's because I closed my big window because I thought just a small one would be enough, but apparently it's not.

34:24.400 --> 34:52.400
Hi, Ms. Ma. Welcome in. How are you doing? Hello.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.400
It's good to see you.

35:00.400 --> 35:08.400
I didn't think I could send one little long to more than one person, but I do appreciate that you and your work. Thank you.

35:08.400 --> 35:18.400
Stop asking me what panties I'm wearing.

35:18.400 --> 35:23.400
Stop spamming. The same question.

35:24.400 --> 35:33.400
I see, like, some of you constantly asking me, but what outfit are you wearing today? What panties are you wearing today?

35:33.400 --> 35:43.400
What do you mean? What outfit? It's always the same thing. Panties and nothing else. That's my daily outfit. Stop asking me that every day.

35:43.400 --> 35:49.400
It's not gonna change until it's, like, winter, okay?

35:50.400 --> 35:54.400
Stupido G-san. Goddamn it.

35:57.400 --> 36:07.400
But what color are they? They're pink. They're basically similar to the ones from yesterday, except that they have teddy bears on them.

36:07.400 --> 36:15.400
So basically the same, like, pattern, but they have also teddy bears on them. So very cute.

36:19.400 --> 36:46.400
You don't only wear panties in the winter. Sometimes I do, because sometimes I like to feel cold, because then when I put the blanket on, it feels like extra cozy and nice.

36:50.400 --> 36:57.400
Will you also tweet an after picture later? No, not yet.

37:00.400 --> 37:04.400
Not yet. Maybe in the future, I will, but not yet.

37:04.400 --> 37:17.400
You have to understand that I'm, you know, taking time with things, like, I feel like it's better when, like, how do I award this?

37:20.400 --> 37:28.400
Oh, okay, I know. I like it when things build up to something, you know?

37:28.400 --> 37:36.400
Like, I don't wanna, like, just in one day, like, do everything and show everything, you know?

37:36.400 --> 37:47.400
I feel like that will just take the fun out of it. And if I do it, like, gradually, then I'll be comfortable doing it, you know?

37:47.400 --> 37:56.400
But I'm not gonna be comfortable if I keep being, like, pressured about it, you know?

37:56.400 --> 38:00.400
Things are better anyways when you build up to them.

38:17.400 --> 38:22.400
And again, doing things gradually is what's gonna make me feel the most comfortable.

38:26.400 --> 38:33.400
Like, you have to understand that it takes me time to open up more and more.

38:33.400 --> 38:49.400
Good, the pace you want to. Yeah, that's what I've been doing.

39:03.400 --> 39:32.400
You already opened up to us plenty the first day. I mean, yeah, but, like,

39:32.400 --> 39:45.400
it needs to be on, like, you know, what feels natural to me in the moment that it happens, because I don't know how else to explain it.

40:02.400 --> 40:17.400
I'm sorry about the background noise.

40:17.400 --> 40:22.400
Make sure your ear is up in.

40:47.400 --> 40:57.400
It's always love and support I see take your time, darling. Thank you for understanding and being patient.

41:17.400 --> 41:23.400
Thank you so much.

41:47.400 --> 41:58.400
And the secret is not here today, but it's not a secret. That was too funny.

42:17.400 --> 42:46.400
What do you consider doing hardiness for some point? Yeah, I've done it twice. The best two streams.

42:47.400 --> 42:54.400
Can you give us a kiss too? Yes, of course.

43:17.400 --> 43:41.400
I love your heartbeat. It suits me so much and it feels so close to you. Thank you.

43:41.400 --> 43:51.400
I was kind of embarrassed yesterday about my heartbeat because it was going so fast and loud. It was kind of embarrassing.

44:12.400 --> 44:17.400
Let me hold your breath.

44:21.400 --> 44:24.400
Stupid fucking cable.

44:41.400 --> 44:57.400
Okay, let me give you a big cuddle like yesterday.

45:11.400 --> 45:20.400
Just give me a big tight hug so you can feel how much I love you.

45:24.400 --> 45:29.400
Stop comfy cuddling with my mister.

45:41.400 --> 45:45.400
Some kisses for you as well.

45:47.400 --> 45:50.400
Kisses for you in cuddle.

45:58.400 --> 46:05.400
I love you so much. I love you so much.

46:12.400 --> 46:18.400
So comfy and nice.

46:21.400 --> 46:24.400
Mister is so nice and warm.

46:29.400 --> 46:32.400
You feel so nice in my arms.

46:41.400 --> 47:07.400
You've been doing so well. I'm so proud of you and everything that you do.

47:11.400 --> 47:22.400
I just appreciate you so much and I appreciate all the love that you have for me as well.

47:22.400 --> 47:35.400
It makes me very happy. It fills my heart with joy but you do fill me up with other stuff too.

47:35.400 --> 47:38.400
I'll be even joy.

47:41.400 --> 47:44.400
And that feels nice too.

47:53.400 --> 47:58.400
I'm sorry. I had to say it. I couldn't help myself.

47:59.400 --> 48:04.400
But I love you so I hope you don't mind.

48:10.400 --> 48:19.400
Last full little cup today aren't we? I mean I have been like a few days now to be honest.

48:20.400 --> 48:25.400
Oh my god there's people from outside. I'm so sorry.

48:25.400 --> 48:32.400
I thought that if I close my bigger window then you wouldn't hear people talking from outside as much.

48:33.400 --> 48:42.400
I'm sorry. If I close the other window it's going to be too hot in my room and then I'm going to get all sweaty and gross.

48:43.400 --> 48:53.400
We were all thinking it but you were brave enough to speak it.

48:53.400 --> 48:58.400
I just like saying stuff like that. I don't know.

48:58.400 --> 49:03.400
I like being sweet and I like to tease sometimes as well.

49:03.400 --> 49:12.400
I think it's really fun to see you get flustered or to tease you.

49:13.400 --> 49:16.400
But I do it out of love.

49:34.400 --> 49:40.400
So comfy. I love something like this.

49:46.400 --> 49:49.400
I love you mister.

50:03.400 --> 50:32.400
Give me lots and lots of kisses because you deserve many and plenty of them.

50:33.400 --> 50:38.400
I love you so much.

51:04.400 --> 51:18.400
So I found two new triggers that I could do today and I wanted to ask you which one you would like me to start with.

51:18.400 --> 51:32.400
One of them is I will put a wig on the 3DO and I will brush the hair and I will do head scratches as well.

51:33.400 --> 51:38.400
And then the second trigger is lotion ear massage.

51:38.400 --> 51:46.400
So basically I'm going to put some lotion on my hands and I'm going to rub your ears nice and slowly.

51:46.400 --> 51:52.400
And make sure they're all nice and moisturized and give you a nice ear massage.

51:52.400 --> 52:04.400
So I will be doing both of them today but I wanted to ask you which one you would like me to start with I guess.

52:05.400 --> 52:07.400
So yeah.

52:20.400 --> 52:23.400
Let's see lotion brushing.

52:24.400 --> 52:28.400
I did look a lot of people want the lotion first.

52:28.400 --> 52:32.400
So I'm going to start with the lotion ear massage.

52:34.400 --> 52:39.400
After that I will do ear brushing and head scratches.

52:39.400 --> 52:44.400
It's that like head scratches scalp massage type of thing.

52:51.400 --> 52:53.400
Hold on. I need you.

52:53.400 --> 53:02.400
Sorry. My stupid cables are like everywhere.

53:02.400 --> 53:05.400
I'm making it hard like two more.

53:05.400 --> 53:07.400
No I'm only.

53:07.400 --> 53:11.400
Because you know how stupid my side of this is.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.400
I think this will be good.

53:24.400 --> 53:26.400
Oh my god.

53:28.400 --> 53:30.400
The freaking people outside.

53:30.400 --> 53:32.400
I can never.

53:32.400 --> 53:39.400
I can never freaking do properly ASMR without some kids screaming in the background. I'm so sorry.

53:41.400 --> 53:43.400
Okay.

53:45.400 --> 53:46.400
So.

53:48.400 --> 53:49.400
What?

53:49.400 --> 53:51.400
I'm trying to put.

53:51.400 --> 53:54.400
My phone in a way that I can see you well.

53:54.400 --> 53:56.400
I do the ear massage.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.400
Kind of complicated.

54:01.400 --> 54:03.400
Fuck.

54:04.400 --> 54:07.400
How do you squeeze this? How do you squeeze it?

54:07.400 --> 54:08.400
Come on.

54:11.400 --> 54:13.400
To be honest this lotion.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.400
Kind of looks like.

54:18.400 --> 54:21.400
Something of yours.

54:26.400 --> 54:28.400
But don't worry. It's not.

54:28.400 --> 54:30.400
It's actual lotion.

54:30.400 --> 54:36.400
Don't worry. I promise I will not take your gummies and rub it on your ears.

54:36.400 --> 54:40.400
I'm not that of a brat. Okay. I still love you.

54:40.400 --> 54:42.400
I will not put you.

54:43.400 --> 54:45.400
Come here.

54:52.400 --> 54:53.400
Okay.

54:53.400 --> 54:55.400
Let me rub my hands.

55:13.400 --> 55:15.400
My hands are a mess.

55:17.400 --> 55:21.400
That's the sound you make when you make love with me.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.400
Okay.

55:34.400 --> 55:36.400
Let's be serious.

55:36.400 --> 55:43.400
This is important moment of me giving you ear massage.

55:43.400 --> 55:45.400
Okay.

56:07.400 --> 56:09.400
One.

56:11.400 --> 56:13.400
One.

56:19.400 --> 56:21.400
One.

56:24.400 --> 56:26.400
Three.

56:27.400 --> 56:29.400
Three.

56:30.400 --> 56:32.400
Three.

56:37.400 --> 56:39.400
Four.

56:42.400 --> 56:46.400
Let me massage your ears so they can feel all nice.

56:47.400 --> 56:49.400
All nice and moist moist.

57:06.400 --> 57:08.400
Okay.

57:37.400 --> 57:39.400
Okay.

57:52.400 --> 57:54.400
What kind of lotion?

57:54.400 --> 57:56.400
No.

57:56.400 --> 57:58.400
No, it's not.

57:59.400 --> 58:01.400
It's not more.

58:02.400 --> 58:04.400
Okay.

58:04.400 --> 58:06.400
It's not soap.

58:07.400 --> 58:09.400
Blah blah blah blah.

58:10.400 --> 58:12.400
Okay.

58:30.400 --> 58:33.400
It's like for the face.

58:40.400 --> 58:42.400
Okay.

58:49.400 --> 58:53.400
It's just that I'm not the only officer at this time.

58:53.400 --> 59:02.400
I don't know why but I think there's like something really cute about like knowing what Jason is in the office at work.

59:02.400 --> 59:04.400
I don't know.

59:04.400 --> 59:06.400
I think there's something I'm not like.

59:07.400 --> 59:11.400
I can tease or tease him at work.

59:11.400 --> 59:14.400
I'll get him more worked up.

59:17.400 --> 59:19.400
Does it have a sound?

59:19.400 --> 59:21.400
No, not really.

59:37.400 --> 59:40.400
I had work coming to be careful.

59:43.400 --> 01:00:03.400
I think like a cute and like funny scenario is like if you're at work and you get like a major boner because of me and you get all embarrassed about it.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.400
Okay.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.400
You can't hold it, I see.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:47.400
So you're taking your pants off right now in the office for me.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:57.400
I got fun dynamic work.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:00.400
Put them on mine and I'll get to listen to you.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.400
Nice.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.400
Is she like all flustered?

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.400
It's a bit from the office when...

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.400
Oh my god, that would be really, that would be really like sweet.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.400
I love the suggestions running through the bathroom right now.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.400
Please.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:31.400
I was trying to get me fired.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.400
Fired up for me.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.400
Sorry.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.400
You're perfect.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.400
That was very important.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:56.400
Imagine you're like, I'm sorry, but I have this huge boner and I just have to turn it.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.400
Or I can't keep working.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.400
This is an emergency, please understand.

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.400
Now that is an interesting game we're playing.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.400
Yeah, but it's fun.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.400
That's why I want to play it.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.400
I want to do something.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.400
To do it up your ass.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.400
And send it to me on my maros.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:26.400
And then tell me how much you love me.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.400
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.400
There's just something hard about it, okay?

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:50.400
Like, the idea of mister, you know, being so in love with me

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.400
and feeling so much lost for me isn't.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:01.400
You just can't help it and, you know, just stop it.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.400
I'm so nudge today, I'm sorry.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.400
I can't help myself.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.400
Dangerous to the copper bath.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.400
As you should.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.400
I'm getting dangerous because I'm doing something and now I shouldn't.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.400
No, no, you're overthinking it.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.400
I think you should.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.400
You should definitely do it.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.400
For me.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.400
Cup in heat.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.400
Yes, in heat for the best few days.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.400
Can I make a seat on the couch?

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.400
Fuck.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.400
I see you need to relax.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.400
No, I need to fuck.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.400
I need to fuck with something.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:32.400
I'm sorry, I can't stop.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.400
I can't stop.

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.400
I'm trying so hard to behave, but I just can't.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.400
I see on the road to get into one of those seats.

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.400
I hope not.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.400
I hope not.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.400
That would be so bad.

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.400
Stranny's gonna kill me.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:21.400
Sounds like being a naughty couple is some correction of destiny.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.400
No, no, I don't.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.400
I'm a good girl.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.400
I don't need no correction.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.400
I'm number one good girl.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.400
Says she's a good girl.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:40.400
Gets you fired from your job because she tells you to jerk off in the office.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.400
I'm a good girl.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:03.400
Maybe this suck you was better than you after.

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.400
Maybe it was.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.400
You're a very good girl.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.400
But you being naughty, we know.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.400
No, I'm not.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.400
No, I'm being a good girl.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:29.400
I'm a good girl for my Mr. that's all types right now.

01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:33.180
Hello kinda girl, Thank you for joking with me.

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:46.180
Are you thin or dying with this quickening?

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:51.200
