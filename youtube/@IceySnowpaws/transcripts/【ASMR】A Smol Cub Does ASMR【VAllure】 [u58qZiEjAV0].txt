Okay, I'm gonna end the stream then, if you didn't miss me, if you don't want my attention, I will end the stream right now.
I'm glad you miss me, that makes me happy, because I'm bucketsrill, but you already know that so.
ვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვ�
It's really nice and excitement and lots and lots of good feelings.
The mom stream man's always wants to see you again.
That's really sweet.
When I end the stream, I miss you too, to be honest.
That's why I don't know you have so much on Twitter because I miss you.
I want to give you some kisses.
I miss you so much.
I miss you so much.
I miss you so much.
I miss you so much.
It's nice to get up from work and calm down with your ASMR.
Thank you.
I'm glad I can calm you down and get you all relaxed.
I love your kisses.
I love giving those kisses to you.
That works perfectly, doesn't it?
I think I'm gonna melt her a mystery before they can start his day, but that's okay.
I'll be a bottle full for my cup.
I mean, this is kind of embarrassing, but to be honest, I felt like a bottle the whole day today.
It's like I read your messages and you know, some of the other snappies sent me and it makes me feel a lot of feelings and stuff.
So I've been kind of like a bottle that's been feeling like butterflies all day.
I didn't make a bottle.
I mean, I kind of did, but that's embarrassing.
I hope you are too overwhelmed.
I'm definitely overwhelmed, but I don't think it's gotten to a bad point.
Does that make sense?
It's overwhelmed, but in a good way, you know, overwhelmed.
How would I describe it?
Basically overflowing with happiness and good feelings.
So I'm not like feeling bad.
So it's all okay.
The strong feelings can be overwhelming.
Yeah, especially when you're like me, someone who feels their emotions extra strong.
And it's like just like a whole wave taking a hold of me.
Overflowing with our love and loving.
Yes.
Very true.
I know you're strong, got emptied out, people really love you.
Yeah, I still don't know what I did to deserve it, to be honest.
Like when it happened, I thought I was like half asleep or something.
It was just, I was like, I don't know, it's like really nice.
But at the same time, I feel like a little bad because I feel like super spoiled and like I really didn't do all the much to deserve it or anything like that.
Can you add more to your surround so we can get you more stuff?
I don't know.
I feel really bad, like I feel really, really spoiled, rotten.
I feel bad if I'm gonna like add more stuff, you know, cause like it just got emptied and I don't know.
I'm gonna feel like, I don't know, like a bad person and like greedy if I put more stuff.
You know what I mean?
Thank you for everything. No, thank you for everything. You've done so much for me. You've opened so kind to me.
But we want to spoil, but I feel so bad. I feel like, I don't know, I don't know, it's like a mental thing I guess.
Like it's really weird, like it's really nice, you know, it's sweet to be this spoiled, but it's like when it happens, you know, and then you see it happen, it's like, oh no, I feel so bad.
I don't know, you're telling me like not to feel bad about it and that you genuinely want me, that you genuinely want to spoil me and stuff, and I find that very sweet.
But for now at least, I don't know if I'm gonna add more stuff, just cause like it just got emptied, you know, and it just feel really greedy like instantly putting more stuff on it.
I don't know, okay, maybe this is extreme, but if like, you know, my wish list got emptied and I put more stuff on it right away, I would feel like a bitch.
And that's, maybe it sounds like extreme, but like in my head it's like, wow what a fucking bitch, she just got like her entire wish list like cleared and she's adding more, what the fuck is her problem?
You know, like that's how my brain works, I'm like, no, like maybe after a while, you know, but alright now I guess, cause I would feel pretty bad.
It's okay to set stuff when you feel like it, yeah, exactly.
Are you holding onto a pillow or an arm? It's a pillow.
Think about it like this, a jesus on Thursday and every day is Christmas.
But I don't know if I've been such a good girl every single day that I deserve for it to be Christmas every day, you know.
I don't have a chimney though, so that wouldn't work.
I guess when you're monetized people can spoil you then, I suppose, if they want to, you know, there's no pressure.
Speaking of that, speaking of being monetized and stuff, I'm actually monetized and this Saturday at 6pm CET, like the same time that I always start my streams, I will have two different streams in the same day,
so basically at my usual time when I start, it will be monetization and membership celebration and I know it's not all that interactive or maybe sounds all that much fun,
but I really want to watch Blade Runner 4029, I think it's the number, but my memory is really bad, but that's what I want to do and then after that, after that there will be a drunk,
karaoke stream for members only, so anyone who is a member will be able to join it and it will happen once we're finished watching the movie.
Also, another thing I feel like the best thing would be is to thank all the people that join a membership to thank all of you at the end of the karaoke stream so that I don't do it in the middle of us watching the movie, I guess, so it's not too destructive,
but at the end of the karaoke stream, I will thank each and every person who joined.
I'm not a good singer, but I'm definitely not a good singer, I just think for fun, not cause I'm good at it or anything.
And then drunk and karaoke sounds like a perfect night with IC, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm really excited because that means that on Saturday we will be spending extra time together, usually, you know, I stream two hours, so I will spend like maybe four hours on Saturday.
I'm also sorry for you having so much, there's just a lot to talk about today at the start of the stream anyways.
You're singing during the DJ stream was cute. Thank you, thank you.
Oh, you see, Donkey Kong wanted to thank donors and stuff from yesterday through. Thank you for reminding me. My memory is so fucking bad.
Thank you for reminding me. I almost forgot us.
Let me get closer to my screen.
Okay, so during the DJ stream.
Oh, thank you very, very much for the $100 tip. Holy shit.
That's a lot. Why did you do that? But thank you. I really appreciate it.
Your DJ stream is blessed. Thank you. I'm glad you enjoyed the DJ stream. I had plenty of fun.
And thank you Anonymous for the $5 tip. There was no message attached to this one, but thank you for supporting me. I appreciate it.
We love the herbs. I'm glad. I'm glad you do.
It's not like that every streamer just wanted to get those stuff out of the way.
The DJ stream was big. Thank you. I'm glad you think so. I genuinely had so much fun. And I'm so excited to do another one. It's just so much fun, you know. It was amazing.
The DJ was so damn fun. Only downside was me drinking shitty dry gin. Well, next time you get a nice drink so you can enjoy the stream even more. Okay?
I really liked your eyes wings if it's all around you. Right? I thought it looked so freaking cute too. It was like perfect cute outfit for me.
But yeah, I'm genuinely excited for another DJ stream. I had a total blast. I just had so much fun the entire time. There was no dull moment.
It was so much fun. I'm so excited to do another one. I'm so excited to do another one.
I'm so excited to do another one. I'm so excited to do another one. I'm so excited to do another one.
I'm so excited to do another one. I'm so excited to do another one. I'm so excited to do another one.
By the way, I just remembered there was another thing. I was initially just gonna write it on Twitter, but I feel like I might as well bring it up here, I think, except that I don't know how to talk about it without feeling all shy about it. I'm embarrassed.
So, you know how earlier I was talking about Maros and all the sweet stuff you sent me and all your kind of loving words and you know, the lustful Maros?
So, I don't know if anyone knows that, but if you ever want to send another one, obviously to me only, I don't want those things from people who send it to multiple girls.
But if you know you know basically, say if you've already sent it before and you want to send it again only to me, cause you love me, then don't feel bad about sending it again, like if you want to.
You know what I mean? So, if you want to make another one, show me how in love you are with me and show how much love you have pouring out of you.
I think that's really sweet if you send it again, like don't feel bad that like, oh it's the same person or it's more like, oh it's me again, like you can send it again, you know?
I give all my love to you, I see, thank you, I find that extremely sweet and romantic, so thank you.
But yeah, sorry, if it's not weird, I just get really shy talking about the stuff out loud like this.
But yeah, I only accept them again from the misters who love me, so please don't send me any if you send them to the other girls as well.
Cause the way that I see it, it's a way for us to be intimate, you know, and special together, you know, it's like, I don't know, that's just how I see it I guess.
So if you go and do it and send it like to another girl, it will make me sad, you know, it will make me genuinely sad and I don't want to be sad, so just avoid sending it all together to me in that case, you know?
I hope that makes sense.
I'll never send one to anyone else, I see it's my one and only. Thank you, I'm glad.
So can we send one to you that's made only for you because I want to love all of you? Wait, what do you mean? I'm a bit confused with the last part of the question.
You're the only person I've ever sent to a video. I'm glad that it makes me feel, I don't know, really special and happy as well.
I'm actually happy you spoke about it instead of keeping quiet and holding it in. Thanks for telling us your feelings.
Yeah, I just, I feel like I should be honest with how things make me feel because, you know, if something makes me sad, then I'm clearly not going to enjoy it.
You know, if I get, like, a tribute and then, like, it wasn't sent just to me or because Mr. loves only me, then, you know, that's gonna make me sad because I feel it as something special and, like, intimate between us.
And if you don't see it the same way, then I don't want it, you know? Like, there's just, I don't get anything, like, from it like it doesn't make me feel happy or good or anything.
So that's why I thought that I should, like, address it so that, you know, I can be happy and those who love me can, you know, get to share special moments like that with me.
Thank you very much.
Can we get one round? Because we have a condition update.
It's been pretty nice today. The wind has been cold for the most part of the day, starting out right now, but that's because I closed my big window because I thought just a small one would be enough, but apparently it's not.
Hi, Ms. Ma. Welcome in. How are you doing? Hello.
It's good to see you.
I didn't think I could send one little long to more than one person, but I do appreciate that you and your work. Thank you.
Stop asking me what panties I'm wearing.
Stop spamming. The same question.
I see, like, some of you constantly asking me, but what outfit are you wearing today? What panties are you wearing today?
What do you mean? What outfit? It's always the same thing. Panties and nothing else. That's my daily outfit. Stop asking me that every day.
It's not gonna change until it's, like, winter, okay?
Stupido G-san. Goddamn it.
But what color are they? They're pink. They're basically similar to the ones from yesterday, except that they have teddy bears on them.
So basically the same, like, pattern, but they have also teddy bears on them. So very cute.
You don't only wear panties in the winter. Sometimes I do, because sometimes I like to feel cold, because then when I put the blanket on, it feels like extra cozy and nice.
Will you also tweet an after picture later? No, not yet.
Not yet. Maybe in the future, I will, but not yet.
You have to understand that I'm, you know, taking time with things, like, I feel like it's better when, like, how do I award this?
Oh, okay, I know. I like it when things build up to something, you know?
Like, I don't wanna, like, just in one day, like, do everything and show everything, you know?
I feel like that will just take the fun out of it. And if I do it, like, gradually, then I'll be comfortable doing it, you know?
But I'm not gonna be comfortable if I keep being, like, pressured about it, you know?
Things are better anyways when you build up to them.
And again, doing things gradually is what's gonna make me feel the most comfortable.
Like, you have to understand that it takes me time to open up more and more.
Good, the pace you want to. Yeah, that's what I've been doing.
You already opened up to us plenty the first day. I mean, yeah, but, like,
it needs to be on, like, you know, what feels natural to me in the moment that it happens, because I don't know how else to explain it.
I'm sorry about the background noise.
Make sure your ear is up in.
It's always love and support I see take your time, darling. Thank you for understanding and being patient.
Thank you so much.
And the secret is not here today, but it's not a secret. That was too funny.
What do you consider doing hardiness for some point? Yeah, I've done it twice. The best two streams.
Can you give us a kiss too? Yes, of course.
I love your heartbeat. It suits me so much and it feels so close to you. Thank you.
I was kind of embarrassed yesterday about my heartbeat because it was going so fast and loud. It was kind of embarrassing.
Let me hold your breath.
Stupid fucking cable.
Okay, let me give you a big cuddle like yesterday.
Just give me a big tight hug so you can feel how much I love you.
Stop comfy cuddling with my mister.
Some kisses for you as well.
Kisses for you in cuddle.
I love you so much. I love you so much.
So comfy and nice.
Mister is so nice and warm.
You feel so nice in my arms.
You've been doing so well. I'm so proud of you and everything that you do.
I just appreciate you so much and I appreciate all the love that you have for me as well.
It makes me very happy. It fills my heart with joy but you do fill me up with other stuff too.
I'll be even joy.
And that feels nice too.
I'm sorry. I had to say it. I couldn't help myself.
But I love you so I hope you don't mind.
Last full little cup today aren't we? I mean I have been like a few days now to be honest.
Oh my god there's people from outside. I'm so sorry.
I thought that if I close my bigger window then you wouldn't hear people talking from outside as much.
I'm sorry. If I close the other window it's going to be too hot in my room and then I'm going to get all sweaty and gross.
We were all thinking it but you were brave enough to speak it.
I just like saying stuff like that. I don't know.
I like being sweet and I like to tease sometimes as well.
I think it's really fun to see you get flustered or to tease you.
But I do it out of love.
So comfy. I love something like this.
I love you mister.
Give me lots and lots of kisses because you deserve many and plenty of them.
I love you so much.
So I found two new triggers that I could do today and I wanted to ask you which one you would like me to start with.
One of them is I will put a wig on the 3DO and I will brush the hair and I will do head scratches as well.
And then the second trigger is lotion ear massage.
So basically I'm going to put some lotion on my hands and I'm going to rub your ears nice and slowly.
And make sure they're all nice and moisturized and give you a nice ear massage.
So I will be doing both of them today but I wanted to ask you which one you would like me to start with I guess.
So yeah.
Let's see lotion brushing.
I did look a lot of people want the lotion first.
So I'm going to start with the lotion ear massage.
After that I will do ear brushing and head scratches.
It's that like head scratches scalp massage type of thing.
Hold on. I need you.
Sorry. My stupid cables are like everywhere.
I'm making it hard like two more.
No I'm only.
Because you know how stupid my side of this is.
I think this will be good.
Oh my god.
The freaking people outside.
I can never.
I can never freaking do properly ASMR without some kids screaming in the background. I'm so sorry.
Okay.
So.
What?
I'm trying to put.
My phone in a way that I can see you well.
I do the ear massage.
Kind of complicated.
Fuck.
How do you squeeze this? How do you squeeze it?
Come on.
To be honest this lotion.
Kind of looks like.
Something of yours.
But don't worry. It's not.
It's actual lotion.
Don't worry. I promise I will not take your gummies and rub it on your ears.
I'm not that of a brat. Okay. I still love you.
I will not put you.
Come here.
Okay.
Let me rub my hands.
My hands are a mess.
That's the sound you make when you make love with me.
Okay.
Let's be serious.
This is important moment of me giving you ear massage.
Okay.
One.
One.
One.
Three.
Three.
Three.
Four.
Let me massage your ears so they can feel all nice.
All nice and moist moist.
Okay.
Okay.
What kind of lotion?
No.
No, it's not.
It's not more.
Okay.
It's not soap.
Blah blah blah blah.
Okay.
It's like for the face.
Okay.
It's just that I'm not the only officer at this time.
I don't know why but I think there's like something really cute about like knowing what Jason is in the office at work.
I don't know.
I think there's something I'm not like.
I can tease or tease him at work.
I'll get him more worked up.
Does it have a sound?
No, not really.
I had work coming to be careful.
I think like a cute and like funny scenario is like if you're at work and you get like a major boner because of me and you get all embarrassed about it.
Okay.
You can't hold it, I see.
So you're taking your pants off right now in the office for me.
I got fun dynamic work.
Put them on mine and I'll get to listen to you.
Nice.
Is she like all flustered?
It's a bit from the office when...
Oh my god, that would be really, that would be really like sweet.
I love the suggestions running through the bathroom right now.
Please.
I was trying to get me fired.
Fired up for me.
Sorry.
You're perfect.
That was very important.
Imagine you're like, I'm sorry, but I have this huge boner and I just have to turn it.
Or I can't keep working.
This is an emergency, please understand.
Now that is an interesting game we're playing.
Yeah, but it's fun.
That's why I want to play it.
I want to do something.
To do it up your ass.
And send it to me on my maros.
And then tell me how much you love me.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.
There's just something hard about it, okay?
Like, the idea of mister, you know, being so in love with me
and feeling so much lost for me isn't.
You just can't help it and, you know, just stop it.
I'm so nudge today, I'm sorry.
I can't help myself.
Dangerous to the copper bath.
As you should.
I'm getting dangerous because I'm doing something and now I shouldn't.
No, no, you're overthinking it.
I think you should.
You should definitely do it.
For me.
Cup in heat.
Yes, in heat for the best few days.
Can I make a seat on the couch?
Fuck.
I see you need to relax.
No, I need to fuck.
I need to fuck with something.
I'm sorry, I can't stop.
I can't stop.
I'm trying so hard to behave, but I just can't.
I see on the road to get into one of those seats.
I hope not.
I hope not.
That would be so bad.
Stranny's gonna kill me.
Sounds like being a naughty couple is some correction of destiny.
No, no, I don't.
I'm a good girl.
I don't need no correction.
I'm number one good girl.
Says she's a good girl.
Gets you fired from your job because she tells you to jerk off in the office.
I'm a good girl.
Maybe this suck you was better than you after.
Maybe it was.
You're a very good girl.
But you being naughty, we know.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm being a good girl.
I'm a good girl for my Mr. that's all types right now.
Hello kinda girl, Thank you for joking with me.
Are you thin or dying with this quickening?
Every hair and light kind of thing,
