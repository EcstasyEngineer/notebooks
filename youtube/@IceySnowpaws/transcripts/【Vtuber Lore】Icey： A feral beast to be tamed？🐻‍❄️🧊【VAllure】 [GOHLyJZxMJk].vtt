00:00.000 --> 00:15.680
Fear is an emotion that has faded my mind for as long as I can remember, yet, today,

00:15.680 --> 00:20.280
I am scared.

00:20.280 --> 00:25.040
I cannot remember when or how I came to this land.

00:25.040 --> 00:31.880
Mother tells me she had followed a trail from a mysterious wreckage and found me in a cave.

00:31.880 --> 00:38.680
I was surrounded by death and darkness, yet I was the only one to survive.

00:38.680 --> 00:44.240
This day she told me of was the last time I had ever cried.

00:44.240 --> 00:50.520
She had seen the unfathomable abuse that plagued her family for generations, the monster of

00:50.520 --> 00:55.240
a bear that wriggled fear throughout the food chain of this land.

00:55.240 --> 01:03.840
Its mere presence cursing the very soil under the snow, that, here it was, that at the hands

01:03.840 --> 01:08.400
of a mere child who said crying alone.

01:08.400 --> 01:15.200
It was then she had decided to raise me as her own, along with my brother and sister.

01:15.200 --> 01:22.360
She taught me strength to hunt, to survive.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.360
I had no memories of my birth family.

01:25.360 --> 01:31.960
I did not feel the need to search for them, or I had my family here, and they had me.

01:31.960 --> 01:37.320
I was a bear like them, and they treated me no different.

01:37.320 --> 01:43.600
We all shared the same love, but Mama knew it was not meant to be.

01:43.720 --> 01:49.640
There comes a time in the bear's life where they must go out on their own, and that time

01:49.640 --> 01:52.080
was approaching fast.

01:52.080 --> 01:59.880
Mama knew the cops would be fine, but me, I couldn't even find them being without them.

01:59.880 --> 02:05.560
Until one day, over the mountains, she happened upon an answer.

02:05.560 --> 02:11.320
An answer I didn't want to accept, but one I had to.

02:11.360 --> 02:19.120
And now, this day, the day if fear finally formed in my heart for the first time, saying

02:19.120 --> 02:26.400
their final goodbyes, my brother went one way, my sister went another.

02:26.400 --> 02:34.440
But there I stood, my body and mind, tempered from this land of unforgiving cold, was frozen

02:34.440 --> 02:37.360
still.

02:37.400 --> 02:44.640
Mother offered me her strength one last time, enough to cement the final memory of her tenderness,

02:44.640 --> 02:48.160
my final goodbye.

02:48.160 --> 02:53.600
She would watch over me one last time, when my journey down from the mountaintop into

02:53.600 --> 02:55.800
the unknown of the future.

02:55.800 --> 03:02.400
The memory of her love within me made the fear in my heart melt away, like the ice and

03:02.400 --> 03:03.400
spring.

03:03.400 --> 03:09.000
But she reminded me that the warmth of her love made me into a survivor.
