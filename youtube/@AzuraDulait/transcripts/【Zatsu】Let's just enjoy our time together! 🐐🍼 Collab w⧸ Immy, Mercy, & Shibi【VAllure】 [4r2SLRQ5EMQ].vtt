01:55.560 --> 02:07.560
We might do some like Q&A and then some like would you rather questions or like will you press the button questions or just maybe we'll just tell each other really bad pickup lines there.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.560
Try to raise each other up.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.560
We spent like what was it like the first.

02:15.560 --> 02:16.560
It was like an hour.

02:16.560 --> 02:17.560
It was a legit hour.

02:17.560 --> 02:21.560
Yeah like an hour trying to make this work and I'm so sorry everyone that it didn't work out.

02:21.560 --> 02:26.560
Literally Ubisoft said you don't own Uno and I said what do you mean it's right here.

02:26.560 --> 02:36.560
Yeah I purchased it and did like family sharing from our other accounts and then to let me had to buy it on our normal accounts and that still didn't work.

02:36.560 --> 02:43.560
Only it only worked for me and Emmy and Azura and then it just wouldn't open and then it just nothing was working.

02:43.560 --> 02:44.560
It was so dumb.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.560
It was press play and then just close it out again.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.560
Press play, close it out again.

02:48.560 --> 02:49.560
Crash.

02:50.560 --> 02:53.560
So I hate Ubisoft.

02:53.560 --> 02:54.560
We all hate Ubisoft.

02:54.560 --> 02:55.560
We all hate Ubisoft.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.560
We all hate Ubisoft in this house.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.560
That's why my thumbnail is annoying.

03:03.560 --> 03:04.560
We paid twice.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.560
We paid twice and it still didn't work.

03:08.560 --> 03:09.560
They're just trying to steal our money.

03:09.560 --> 03:12.560
I can't wait to refund every game title from them.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.560
Sending the CEO a personalized letter.

03:17.560 --> 03:19.560
Sending the CEO a seasoned assist.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.560
It doesn't make any sense but I'm doing it.

03:24.560 --> 03:36.560
But yeah if you guys have questions for us let's do, we'll do a couple of would you, will you press the button questions and then you guys can come up with questions and post them in our respective chats.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.560
And then maybe we'll read like one from each of our chats.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.560
The questions are going to be like did you guys have sex in real life yet?

03:44.560 --> 03:47.560
When are you going to have sex in real life?

03:48.560 --> 03:49.560
Not yet.

03:49.560 --> 03:50.560
With each other?

03:50.560 --> 03:51.560
Soon.

03:52.560 --> 03:53.560
Very soon.

03:54.560 --> 03:58.560
But yeah that will give you some time to think of questions to ask us.

03:59.560 --> 04:00.560
Let's see.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.560
Let me find a good will you.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.560
I'm wondering if I should do this one.

04:07.560 --> 04:12.560
I don't think we want to be based right off the bat.

04:13.560 --> 04:14.560
I do!

04:14.560 --> 04:19.560
I'm going to send you guys a screenshot of the question it just asked.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.560
I'm dying.

04:24.560 --> 04:25.560
Oh god here you go.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.560
What is the screenshot?

04:28.560 --> 04:29.560
It's in general.

04:31.560 --> 04:32.560
Oh shit.

04:33.560 --> 04:34.560
Maybe not that close.

04:34.560 --> 04:35.560
I'm not American I don't care.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.560
Maybe not that one.

04:41.560 --> 04:42.560
Maybe not that one.

04:42.560 --> 04:43.560
I'm not American but.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.560
Some Americans might get triggered.

04:48.560 --> 04:51.560
A lot of people said no to that question.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.560
They wouldn't pass the point which is funny.

04:56.560 --> 04:57.560
This one doesn't make any sense.

04:58.560 --> 04:59.560
What though?

04:59.560 --> 05:00.560
I don't like these.

05:02.560 --> 05:06.560
You will become an extremely attractive girl but no guys will find you attractive.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.560
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.560
What?

05:08.560 --> 05:09.560
It makes sense.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.560
I would be extremely attractive.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.560
I'm already an extremely attractive girl.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.560
What's there to lose?

05:19.560 --> 05:20.560
Oh okay here you go.

05:21.560 --> 05:22.560
Will you press the button?

05:23.560 --> 05:26.560
If you could change the weather at will.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.560
But the weather you choose lasts for a month.

05:31.560 --> 05:32.560
Yes.

05:33.560 --> 05:34.560
Mercy was that a no for me?

05:34.560 --> 05:35.560
That was a no for me.

05:36.560 --> 05:37.560
Okay.

05:37.560 --> 05:38.560
Was there a no life?

05:39.560 --> 05:40.560
It's crazy.

05:40.560 --> 05:41.560
It's changed at will?

05:42.560 --> 05:44.560
Yeah you can change the weather at will.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.560
But the weather you choose lasts for a month.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.560
Oh I will not press the button.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.560
I think I just like rain a lot and I don't want to terrain for a month though.

05:56.560 --> 05:57.560
Oh I do.

05:58.560 --> 05:59.560
You would?

05:59.560 --> 06:00.560
I do want to terrain for a month.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.560
I would just be emo.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.560
I thought you meant like season.

06:03.560 --> 06:04.560
I don't know why.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.560
I thought it was the season.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.560
Weather.

06:09.560 --> 06:12.560
No I don't want it to last a month.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.560
I think that would be too much.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.560
People said they would press the button for that.

06:17.560 --> 06:18.560
Yeah it's a weather.

06:18.560 --> 06:19.560
Yeah it ran.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.560
Because they probably be like oh I want it to be sunny.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.560
No I want it.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.560
I want the opposite.

06:25.560 --> 06:26.560
Fuck the sun dude.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.560
I mean I got a basement.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.560
And all the senpais are there.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.560
They'll all drown if there's too much rain.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.560
But a month is so long.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.560
Yeah you could have given floods.

06:36.560 --> 06:37.560
Yeah depends where people are.

06:38.560 --> 06:39.560
Okay here's the next one.

06:40.560 --> 06:43.560
You can revive and keep loved ones from dying.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.560
But every time you use your powers 50,000 people will die.

06:50.560 --> 06:51.560
I think it's a good idea.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.560
For my big brother yes.

06:54.560 --> 06:55.560
I'm pressing it.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.560
I'm conflicted.

07:01.560 --> 07:04.560
Because I would just kill a senpai.

07:05.560 --> 07:06.560
If I even suspect anything.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.560
But then I already have Emmy.

07:11.560 --> 07:12.560
Who can already do that.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.560
Yeah but usually I don't know.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.560
I don't know.

07:17.560 --> 07:18.560
I don't know.

07:19.560 --> 07:20.560
I don't know.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.560
But usually Emmy's powers come with a sort of twist.

07:24.560 --> 07:25.560
No humans need to die.

07:26.560 --> 07:27.560
No one needs to die.

07:27.560 --> 07:28.560
Everyone live.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.560
I'm killing 50,000 people to bring that back to my house.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.560
Can I choose who to die though?

07:33.560 --> 07:34.560
Like 50,000?

07:35.560 --> 07:37.560
You want to choose 50,000 people specifically by name?

07:38.560 --> 07:39.560
I can choose a country right?

07:41.560 --> 07:42.560
Which country are you choosing?

07:43.560 --> 07:44.560
Okay.

07:45.560 --> 07:46.560
No don't.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.560
Anyway.

07:51.560 --> 07:52.560
That one was almost split.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.560
People put 45% and 55% said no.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.560
Can I kill a country?

07:59.560 --> 08:01.560
Ethno cleansing from Mercy over here.

08:06.560 --> 08:07.560
I'm joshing.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.560
I'm joshing around.

08:10.560 --> 08:11.560
I'm not joshing.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.560
I want to do the...

08:15.560 --> 08:16.560
I want to do it too.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.560
Should we all do the poll?

08:22.560 --> 08:23.560
Where is this poll?

08:25.560 --> 08:27.560
Oh I'm just reading off the questions from the website.

08:30.560 --> 08:34.560
You receive a diary that tells you everything that happens in the future.

08:35.560 --> 08:42.560
But you'll participate in a game where you have to be hunted down by other diary users that can also see the future.

08:42.560 --> 08:43.560
Ooh that sounds like an anime.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.560
Yeah right?

08:47.560 --> 08:48.560
It should be.

08:49.560 --> 08:50.560
It should be.

08:51.560 --> 08:52.560
Future diary?

08:54.560 --> 08:55.560
Oh wait, yeah that's wait.

08:56.560 --> 08:57.560
That's fucking true actually.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.560
I'm like why does it sound so familiar?

09:03.560 --> 09:04.560
I would do it.

09:04.560 --> 09:05.560
I would do it.

09:05.560 --> 09:06.560
It sounds fun.

09:06.560 --> 09:07.560
And plus you have a diary and it tells you.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.560
Yeah that's true.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.560
I feel like would you be clever enough to outwit other diary users though?

09:13.560 --> 09:14.560
What do you mean outwit?

09:14.560 --> 09:15.560
We just killed them.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.560
But they're going to try to kill you too.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.560
They also have the diary.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.560
Yeah but I'll kill them first.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.560
I'm not if I kill them first.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.560
I think I would die so I won't kill them.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.560
You find five dollars, but...

09:36.560 --> 09:38.560
You find five dollars, but...

09:39.560 --> 09:41.560
You give it back to the person who dropped it.

09:43.560 --> 09:44.560
No!

09:44.560 --> 09:45.560
No!

09:45.560 --> 09:46.560
It's a five dollars is mine.

09:47.560 --> 09:48.560
Yeah.

09:48.560 --> 09:52.560
Maybe I want to feel good for that day and be like yeah I did something nice.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.560
You feel good by stealing five dollars.

09:56.560 --> 09:57.560
Yeah exactly.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.560
Five finger discount and get five dollars.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.560
I'll mine if I do.

10:03.560 --> 10:04.560
Yeah.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.560
I wish I could make it smaller.

10:06.560 --> 10:07.560
Probably do it though.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.560
I mean like that's something I just do normal.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.560
Okay stop being a good person.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.560
Yeah what the fuck.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.560
I mean I'm a terrible person.

10:16.560 --> 10:17.560
So awful.

10:17.560 --> 10:20.560
I think babies are gross and...

10:22.560 --> 10:23.560
Babies are gross.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.560
I don't know if I can ask this word.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.560
Ask it.

10:28.560 --> 10:29.560
Ask it.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.560
You have the house of your dreams.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.560
Furniture etc.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.560
All included.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.560
But it's in Somalia.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.560
What's wrong with Somalia?

10:40.560 --> 10:43.560
Well specifically it's in Mogadishu Somalia.

10:43.560 --> 10:47.560
Which is not the same place.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.560
Oh I don't know anything about that place.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.560
Okay ignore that one.

10:52.560 --> 10:53.560
I'll skip it.

10:53.560 --> 10:54.560
I'll skip it.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.560
Yeah we'll skip that.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.560
Pirates?

10:58.560 --> 10:59.560
What?

10:59.560 --> 11:00.560
Furniture.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.560
Wow there's a lot of murderous questions.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.560
You save 10,000 people around the world.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.560
But you have to drown a person with your bare hands.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.560
Easy.

11:12.560 --> 11:13.560
Easy peasy.

11:14.560 --> 11:15.560
I've already done that before.

11:15.560 --> 11:16.560
I've already done that before.

11:16.560 --> 11:17.560
You've already done that before?

11:17.560 --> 11:19.560
I'll just choose a senpai.

11:20.560 --> 11:22.560
Yeah someone that's a willing sacrifice?

11:23.560 --> 11:27.560
Well I mean it's not that hard to sacrifice someone.

11:27.560 --> 11:28.560
Yeah maybe yeah.

11:29.560 --> 11:30.560
Why does every-

11:30.560 --> 11:32.560
Why does all these questions have to do with death?

11:32.560 --> 11:33.560
What is this?

11:34.560 --> 11:36.560
You'd rather push the button.

11:36.560 --> 11:39.560
This one has to do with the fucking FIFA World Cup.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.560
So I'm skipping it.

11:41.560 --> 11:42.560
I don't know anything about FIFA.

11:42.560 --> 11:43.560
I'm sorry senpai.

11:43.560 --> 11:46.560
I'm sorry pin pals.

11:46.560 --> 11:47.560
I'm sorry harems.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.560
I'm sorry bleeding hearts.

11:49.560 --> 11:50.560
I don't know anything about FIFA.

11:51.560 --> 11:52.560
I mean either it's okay.

11:53.560 --> 11:56.560
You can listen to any song with perfect quality in your head.

11:56.560 --> 11:57.560
At any time.

11:58.560 --> 12:01.560
But you must listen to a 30 second ad after this.

12:02.560 --> 12:03.560
No.

12:03.560 --> 12:04.560
No.

12:04.560 --> 12:05.560
This is just Spotify.

12:05.560 --> 12:06.560
Music.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.560
Except in your head.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.560
Spotify.

12:09.560 --> 12:10.560
This is the future.

12:10.560 --> 12:11.560
This is the neural link.

12:11.560 --> 12:12.560
Yeah I was gonna say.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.560
I'm like this is what Elon Musk is gonna do.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.560
This is what Elon Musk is trying to do.

12:16.560 --> 12:17.560
That's what he wants.

12:17.560 --> 12:18.560
No.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.560
I would not.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.560
Yeah I wouldn't either.

12:20.560 --> 12:21.560
I wouldn't.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.560
Probably also because I don't really listen to music.

12:27.560 --> 12:29.560
Ads are the most annoying thing.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.560
Yeah.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.560
Especially it's like that really like annoying ad voice.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.560
Like try Lexa Bro.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.560
Wanna break from the ads?

12:39.560 --> 12:41.560
My favorite hatred of ads is like.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.560
I can't believe I'm playing this game.

12:45.560 --> 12:46.560
Oh my gosh.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.560
And it's like a really big titty woman walking in a line.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.560
All men stack on top of her or something.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.560
Wait I've seen that one too.

12:55.560 --> 12:56.560
That like giantist one right?

12:56.560 --> 12:57.560
Yeah.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.560
I was like Ayo.

13:00.560 --> 13:01.560
How long is the ad?

13:01.560 --> 13:02.560
How long was the ad?

13:03.560 --> 13:05.560
It was like 30 seconds.

13:05.560 --> 13:06.560
Yeah like 30 seconds.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.560
This is a good one.

13:09.560 --> 13:12.560
You become a very famous celebrity.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.560
But you cannot see your family or loved ones often.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.560

13:36.560 --> 13:38.560
I'd be really sad without my mom.

13:40.560 --> 13:41.560
I love my parents.

13:41.560 --> 13:42.560
Get me out of here.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.560
I could love them.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.560
Get me out of here.

It's just...

14:25.280 --> 14:27.280
No, I understand what you mean.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.280
Living with them can be hard.

14:29.280 --> 14:32.280
You pay with your soul instead of with a rent.

14:35.280 --> 14:38.280
Any person of your choosing will want to have sex with you,

14:38.280 --> 14:41.280
but you will die in five years.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.280
I'm not pressing the button, this is already my reality.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.280
Fun!

14:50.280 --> 14:53.280
I know, yeah, I love my hair, I love entertaining my hair.

14:53.280 --> 14:56.280
I don't want to die, so no thank you.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.280
A lot of people said no to that.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.280
You will never experience...

15:05.280 --> 15:07.280
This is a good one for Emmy.

15:07.280 --> 15:10.280
You will never experience difficulty going to the bathroom again,

15:10.280 --> 15:13.280
but you will never remember whether you flushed or not.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.280
This already happens to me!

15:20.280 --> 15:23.280
Sure, I'll press the button, I already don't remember if I flushed.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.280
Yeah, I press it too.

15:25.280 --> 15:26.280
Oh my gosh.

15:27.280 --> 15:30.280
It's like muscle memory to flush, no?

15:30.280 --> 15:32.280
Yeah, so who cares?

15:33.280 --> 15:36.280
And then you're just hoping, because what if you forgot that one time?

15:37.280 --> 15:41.280
Well that's fine, as long as you're not over at a friend's house.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.280
So are you guys pressing the button?

15:45.280 --> 15:46.280
Yes.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.280
Not pressing the button, I'm already regular.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.280
Mercy doesn't suffer with constipation like the rest of us?

15:57.280 --> 16:01.280
I know, she doesn't have irritable bowel syndrome or something.

16:01.280 --> 16:04.280
I do have IBS, just not that IBS.

16:06.280 --> 16:09.280
Irritable, bouncy boobies syndrome.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.280
Okay, so this is a good question.

16:16.280 --> 16:21.280
Any children you have with your fans will be very beautiful,

16:22.280 --> 16:24.280
but they'll be really really dumb.

16:25.280 --> 16:29.280
So if you, your senpais, how to, you know, chat with your senpais,

16:29.280 --> 16:31.280
they just be really dumb ass child, but they're...

16:31.280 --> 16:35.280
I'm pressing the button because I'm kinda already dumb, so it's like...

16:37.280 --> 16:38.280
It's already gonna happen.

16:38.280 --> 16:43.280
I'm pressing the button, as long as I'm kind.

16:43.280 --> 16:46.280
As long as I'm found as kind and thoughtful,

16:46.280 --> 16:48.280
as a little stupidity, it's okay.

16:48.280 --> 16:52.280
Hopefully they're not, like, the one character from the one book

16:52.280 --> 16:57.280
that accidentally kills things because she's really dumb.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.280
She's like Rape's a wrap, I don't know.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.280
Same author, forget it.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.280
Yeah, I hit the button.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.280

26:14.240 --> 26:15.360

26:39.360 --> 26:46.080
oh someone said who do you think is the most degen of the four of us degen straw um i think a

26:46.080 --> 26:48.640
lot of us hide our power will level from each other

26:50.960 --> 26:57.280
they say out of the i think i say out of the four of us out of the four of us the four of us

26:57.440 --> 27:00.480
out of the four of us might be in me

27:02.880 --> 27:08.560
if i was in another form i might uh i think it's in me match in me's degen this but

27:08.560 --> 27:13.760
i think it's in me i gotta keep it classy being being mad at him you know

27:15.520 --> 27:18.000
although just wait for my hentai tag tier list

who is the strongest drinker out of all four of us not me

27:34.640 --> 27:40.160

27:41.520 --> 27:48.240
how much do you drink i i feel like a drink three three to four bottles of soju

27:49.120 --> 27:54.800
of soju i don't so i'll have like one bottle of soju and halfway through it i'm already gone

27:55.680 --> 28:03.360
i don't know how much i drink but if i want to have fun i'll have like a whole bottle of baileys

28:04.240 --> 28:06.240
why are you blushing at me is something the matter

28:10.240 --> 28:18.000

28:26.560 --> 28:33.200
uh few sips and i'm gone yeah all the fucking medication i'm on i'm done

28:36.320 --> 28:37.920
someone said who could squirt the farthest

and i'm like in the shower i feel like i could piss pretty far if i like the force when wait was

29:00.240 --> 29:05.520
there a question about pipi how did this happen where is the four like and squirt is essentially

29:05.520 --> 29:09.680

like a constant like notification pop popping up over and over

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:43.680

yeah management experience and not even lore wise just like me

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.920

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:30.880
yeah we're all we're all adults so give me one sex test allegations

what's the favorite audio you've recorded so far

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:20.720
i liked my armpit audio the most because i feel like i'm not really good

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:26.720
at acting subby i feel like my audio is where i act more dominant i feel more comfortable

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:32.560
so that's my favorite one where you fucking lick the sweat off of my armpit while you're jork in it

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.840
