Can you guys hear me?

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Can you hear me?

12
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,360
I am.

13
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,360
Hi hi.

14
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Hi.

15
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
How are you?

16
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
Hi hi.

17
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
How are my babies?

18
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,360
How are my sweet little bleeding hearts?

19
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,360
How are you all?

20
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,360
I am doing good.

21
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
I am doing good.

22
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
I am doing good.

23
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
I am doing good.

24
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,360
I am glad you are all doing really well.

25
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
I am doing okay.

26
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
I have some

27
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
some things

28
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,360
that we can talk about before we start.

29
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,360
Okay?

30
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
Oh wow!

31
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Welcome in Penpal.

32
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Hi Penpal.

33
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,360
Thank you Emmy for the red.

34
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,360
Welcome in everyone.

35
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
How are you all?

36
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Hi hi.

37
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,360
Hi hi.

38
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,360
Hi hi. Welcome in. Welcome in.

39
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,360
I hope your stream was really fun.

40
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,360
I think it was your monetization stream.

41
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
Monetization celebration.

42
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Congratulations.

43
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Congratulations Emmy. Yay.

44
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Hello.

45
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,360
Thank you.

46
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Thank you thank you.

47
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Yeah it was super fun.

48
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
I am glad you had fun!

49
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
It's so good.

50
00:06:42,360 --> 00:07:06,360
While speaking of monetisation, though we'll probably have to wait a little longer, I'll have to take even extra steps to being a little more careful.

51
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:21,360
That also includes no more singing on stream as well, so we've got to be careful.

52
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:48,360
I got copyrighted by some fake singing for just acapella singing, which isn't because of just the copyright itself, it interferes with stuff.

53
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:58,360
I got copyrighted three times.

54
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:26,360
Youtube is strict against it, but they're also strict against the scammers, the fake people, copyrighting stuff that isn't actually theirs, so we'll just have to wait till things are safer, to start doing stuff again.

55
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Thank you so much for the 6th dollar, the beer.

56
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
Otter.

57
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Biscotti?

58
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
So you see your name?

59
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
I think I butcher that.

60
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
Like so bad.

61
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:59,360
So I'll be even extra careful.

62
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Let me turn on my light.

63
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
I just realised it's really dark.

64
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360

65
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:42,360
I head.

66
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
I head.

67
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Your tube.

68
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Your womb.

69
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
Yeah, it's a little poopy, but it's our head.

70
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
No worries.

71
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,360
All we can do is continue streaming like normal.

72
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,360
And enjoy us playing and stuff.

73
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,360
I'm just at.

74
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360

thank you

112
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,780
Thank you, appreciate you

113
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,000
thank you, thank you

114
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,920
Very sweet, and I appreciate all of you

115
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:16,620
I am, thank you. I don't really know how to put into words my feelings. I'm really bad

116
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:26,460
with expressing how I feel. So I just kind of just power through everything because that's what

117
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:35,180
I'm used to doing. I'm not really good at emotions because I get really, really, really emotional

118
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,140
and I get nervous and then I don't want to get nervous and then I'll freak out and then I'll cry

119
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:50,300
and I'll be a baby and I want to be a baby. So you gotta be strong, me strong,

120
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:57,500
mama strong because if mama isn't strong then who is gonna be strong?

121
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:03,020
Mama has to be the strongest.

122
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,540
Play league if you want to. That's okay. I want to play straight today.

123
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,180
I really do. I want to play straight.

124
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,860
Yeah, it's car simulator.

125
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,020
Car simulator.

126
00:14:49,020 --> 00:15:17,740
Thank you. Thank you all for fun. I appreciate it so much. Thank you friends.

127
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:24,540
That's $5 to pay. That's very sweet of you. I'm happy that you all stay and stick by me.

128
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,220
I may not be doing so well and I may be like the extreme smallest.

129
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:41,500
Thank you. I had hope so. I really do hope they do. Thank you Phoenix.

130
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:57,900
Hang on.

131
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,660
I feel like there was something else I was supposed to have mentioned. I completely

132
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:18,620
forgot. Don't mind my heart rate. My heart rate is like crazy high. It's fine, okay?

133
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,340
It's fine. Do not be concerned about it. It's perfectly fine.

134
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:36,940
A combination of not really sleeping and I had a thought on my mind so I didn't really get much sleep.

135
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:47,500
I tried but I couldn't so it's just not on my heart rate, okay? Okay, okay.

136
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:58,540
I don't want you guys to constantly tell me to relax unless I really need to.

137
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:06,780
I'll say so otherwise, okay? I don't want you guys to be worried. It makes me a little sad when you

138
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:12,300
guys are extremely worried about me. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine, okay?

139
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,180
All right.

140
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,420
I would hope you would trust me.

141
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:28,620
All right.

142
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:36,220
Wow.

143
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,760
Ndo.

144
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,680
I didn't turn this on.

145
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,540
Uh oh.

146
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:13,540
Ie, we're fine. We're doing things.

147
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:56,540
So, this is part two of stray. If you guys haven't seen the start stray yet, make sure you watch part one.

148
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:13,540
So, remember to watch part one of this game session.

149
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:19,540
Okay, so this is portal. We're continuing from the last stream.

150
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:36,540
If you guys haven't already seen that, okay?

151
00:19:36,540 --> 00:20:04,540
Ie, hang on. That's very strange.

152
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:18,540
It never did that before. Now it's doing it. That's really weird.

153
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:25,540
Okay, that's fine, I guess. When I click off the video, the sound goes away.

154
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:35,540
I want that to come back. How do you bring that back?

155
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:42,540
I know some games have it, and I know some games don't.

156
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:48,540
Oh, they have a thing where you can turn off and cap that.

157
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,540
Oh, for the distance though.

158
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:59,540
Oh, that's so cute.

159
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:06,540
Pause on focus? Pause on focus? Where is that?

160
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:17,540
This? No, that's not. That's not doing it either. It's so strange. Let me change the mode as well.

161
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:23,540
So, I'm not super bright in your face.

162
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Dim lighting.

163
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:36,540
Oh, wait. Am I supposed to go back and then do it, accept it, and then do it?

164
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:57,540
No, that didn't work.

165
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:02,540
Now this is definitely going to be the last, I think.

166
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:09,540
I couldn't get through this. I promise. Watch me. I'm going to get straight through this game.

167
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:15,540
This whole next part.

168
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:20,540
Okay, give me one second.

169
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:58,540
Okay.

170
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:04,540
Right, we're on a rescue mission. This is where we last left off.

171
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:19,540
On rescue mission.

172
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:25,540
Look at all these zerk eggs. They will eat us. I can't do this.

173
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:30,540
I'm not as fast as you. The zerk will get me for sure.

174
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:39,540
Here, take this badge. My papa will recognise it. He will know that you're a friend.

175
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:56,540
You don't know I don't. Open the door for you.

176
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:08,540
Think shameless.

177
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:15,540
This place is really nice, even though it's the slums. I don't know why. I really like it.

178
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:24,540
Imagine if when this place was cleaned up, like super cleaned up and full of light.

179
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:32,540
The only reason why it's falling apart is because people haven't been taken care of it, because they've been gone for hundreds of years.

180
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:57,540
Imagine when this place was all cleaned up. It looked super nice.

181
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:02,540
I don't like the music. It's making me nervous.

182
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:10,540
Look at how huge this wall is.

183
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:18,540
I remember it. It was a symbol of the division between those and the slums in the midtown.

184
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:26,540
The fact that they kept throwing their garbage down here won't man.

185
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:34,540
What a horrible thing to do. Maybe that's why they failed.

186
00:25:48,540 --> 00:26:09,540
Dead end. I'm so nervous. I'm so nervous.

187
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:35,540
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

188
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:44,540
I can't jump. No!

189
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:51,540
I couldn't jump. It wouldn't let me jump. It didn't give me the option.

190
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,540
That's so dumb.

191
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:37,540
No, no, no, no, no!

192
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:56,540
Now what? Oh, under!

193
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,540
Mae'n siwet, mae'n siwet.

194
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,540
Mae'n siwet.

195
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,540

Y Llywodraeth?

219
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:25,540
I can go that way. What's up here?

220
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:42,540
There's two ways to go up here and then I can't come back down or over here.

221
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:55,540
Well, a memory.

222
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:07,540
The scientist I used to work for always said he wanted to retire to a little cottage fishing all day long.

223
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:18,540
Of course, that was not a possibility in the city and nobody could have done that for at least hundreds of years.

224
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:28,540
Let me get to the outside. We found ourselves a little cottage, the harmless fishing rod and a lot of books.

225
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:42,540
I think that's what the scientist would have wanted. But first, we should go find out.

226
00:31:42,540 --> 00:32:09,540
I could not be here.

227
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:38,540
Let's go find out.

228
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:56,540
This is very relaxing. This comes my heart. I like this very much.

229
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:11,540
Guys, how is the game audio so far by the way?

230
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:39,540
It's fine. Audio is fine. Sounds good to me.

231
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:58,540
That was a good little song. Time to go back on to our adventure. Nice relaxation time.

232
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:18,540
Big stretch.

233
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:38,540
You mean car? Clearly I'm a car. What do you mean?

234
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:56,540
Obviously a car.

235
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:08,540
I want to make sure everyone can still hear the game.

236
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:30,540
What are we doing here? I'm assuming I have to go over there. Do I just jump over? Is there anything I have to do with this stuff here?

237
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:46,540
I don't have anything. It's an electric generator. It seems to require some other part of function.

238
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:16,540
It's all gloo-y out here.

239
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:43,540
That was where I was just going to come either way. A window.

240
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:18,540
Egg vincar.

241
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:31,540
Why are the zircs so dirty?

242
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:55,540
And two zircs. They mutated after the humans disappeared.

243
00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:07,540
So now they eat everything and anything. Even metal.

244
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:13,540
Wait, you're in a house there. Who are you?

245
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:23,540
That's my badge. You're wearing. How did you find it? Did my son send you? Oh, shameless. You clever boy.

246
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:33,540
I've been here alone for ages. I came here to test the flux or what it didn't go as planned.

247
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:41,540
I wish I could go back home. I miss my son dearly.

248
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:59,540
You can have a lot around the house if you want, but I have no idea how to escape this place.

249
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:07,540
Who is this?

250
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:13,540
I've seen humans wear costumes like this.

251
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:18,540
They were small and running around, making lots of noise. Children.

252
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:27,540
Oh yes, I remember now. Yeah, they were children. The streets felt much more alive with them.

253
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:42,540
Is their voice always like this? Yeah. I hope it doesn't bother you. I'm sorry.

254
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:52,540
You want the difficulty they brought. You don't seem to love them very much.

255
00:39:52,540 --> 00:40:12,540
Is that the same thing? Seems like it.

256
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:25,540
Wow.

257
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:34,540
I'll stop. Oh, I cute.

258
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:43,540
That's a bear.

259
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:57,540
Sometimes she goes Bremlin and it's adorable. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm pretty old man.

260
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:07,540
Hey, be careful with that defluxer. A full charge it can explode zirks like conferee.

261
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:17,540
This baby needs 1.21 gigawatts to work. And the only thing around here with that kind of juice is the generator outside the house.

262
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:24,540
The problem is that it won't start. I think a fuse blew.

263
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:29,540
And with all the zirks around it's too dangerous for me to go out and fix it.

264
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:40,540
I'm not fast enough, but you just might be. If you can reach the generator and replace the fuse, I should be able to get the defluxer recharged.

265
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:55,540
Come on, follow me. I'll show you what they do.

266
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:24,540
Is there anything else here?

267
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:35,540
I just like jumping on things and destroying stuff. It's fun.

268
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:47,540
I like the sliding doors.

269
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:53,540
Here, it's like this fuse. It's brand new.

270
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,540
Turning on the generator will be loud so expect some zirks.

271
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:06,540
Once you fix the generator, I should be able to charge the end kickstart, the defluxer.

272
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:16,540
You just need to follow this cable, change the fuse, then meet me back here.

273
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:34,540
Cars have the biggest claws, did you know?

274
00:43:46,540 --> 00:44:07,540
May I sleep to your voice? Yeah, you can. Of course you can. That's perfectly fine.

275
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:43,540
Is that it? Are you done? Is that over?

276
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:57,540
Did I come back?

277
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:07,540
I think that's it.

278
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:20,540
Oh my God! Ah no!

279
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:35,540
I didn't even see it though.

280
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:47,540
Excited robot noises. Super excited robot noises.

281
00:45:47,540 --> 00:46:11,540
Amazing you got the generator back on. Yes!

282
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:18,540
Have you seen how powerful the defluxer is? It's definitely our way out of here.

283
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:25,540
Firstly, listening to your stream yesterday, already getting sleepy again. It's inevitable.

284
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:36,540
Just accept your fate and fall asleep fall.

285
00:46:36,540 --> 00:47:00,540
Wait a minute, I might be able to mount this defluxer to your drone.

286
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:07,540
It worked. The defluxer is now installed on your fancy drone here.

287
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:14,540
It's not meant to run off such a small power source. If you use it too much, it cannot function.

288
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:19,540
Just remember, it's dangerous. Now let's go back to the village.

289
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:39,540
I'm coming home son. I'm coming home my baby. I'm coming home.

290
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:51,540
How do you turn it on?

291
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:57,540
I need to help Doc get back to the slums. I have to defluxer now.

292
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:12,540
Oh, it's because I'm messing around. I'm sorry.

293
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:21,540
Oh.

294
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:28,540
Yeah, I'm aware. Take out all the zerk so we can get through.

295
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:36,540
Oh. Wow, it's working great, but I was expecting it can overheat.

296
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:44,540
Let it cool for a bit when that happens. I hope it will last until we reach the village.

297
00:48:44,540 --> 00:49:09,540
That's how you use it.

298
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:23,540
That switch doesn't work. It looks like the electricity has been cut.

299
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:42,540
There must be a way to open the door.

300
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:55,540
Like this?

301
00:49:55,540 --> 00:50:04,540
Wait, I think I know.

302
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:17,540
Like this? I'm smart. I'm so smart.

303
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:34,540
I'm intelligent.

304
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:46,540
Oh, hello.

305
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:29,540
I like having a way to protect myself. I feel so much safer when I can kill things.

306
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:38,540
Murdering things is fun. It's fine. In a game, of course. In a game.

307
00:51:38,540 --> 00:52:03,540
Oh. Run!

308
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:08,540
That was close. Let's go back home.

309
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:34,540
I'm on the door. He was dying.

310
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:50,540
This looks so, like, interesting to live, you know? Like everywhere you go, there's probably, like, these are probably like storefronts or something. Homes. You'd pass by.

311
00:52:51,540 --> 00:53:03,540
I don't know why. I know inner city is definitely not good to live in, but it looks so fun.

312
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:19,540
We're home.

313
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:29,540
Hello.

314
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:38,540
I found the sun. I heard.

315
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:43,540
I go already am.

316
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:50,540
Thanks for saving Doc, little friend. It's great to see the shame. This is no longer alone.

317
00:53:50,540 --> 00:54:04,540
Now we know that we can fight back against the Zergs. Mama has been waiting for you by the Zergs.

318
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:15,540
Doc and Shamans look happy. I think we did a good thing together.

319
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:28,540
Hey, Daddy. What's up, Rosie? Billy? You know my son, Shamans? It's thanks to him that I came back from that damn place.

320
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:52,540
Yeah, sure. I thought happy is back. Aw. That's so sweet.

321
00:54:53,540 --> 00:55:12,540
Aw. No go. Did I do everything here? I think I did everything here. I have nothing else on my inventory.

322
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:21,540
We ran out 51% through the game.

323
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:36,540
It's time to move on. Hi. Mama was waiting for you on his boat. You can join him, but have you done everything you wanted here? I think so.

324
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:48,540
I'll close the door behind you. Don't want any Zergs coming through. I think so, right? Was there anything else we needed to do?

325
00:55:48,540 --> 00:56:01,540
Hi there. Hi.

326
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:11,540
The Fluxer is actually is really just a giant LED light. It's true. You will.

327
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:19,540
Yeah, we're leaving. Well, we're going to go a little deeper, I think. We're going to go into the sewers next.

328
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:26,540
I love this place. So nice.

329
00:56:50,540 --> 00:57:15,540

I king!

332
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:52,540
Was there even anyone in here? I remember scratching on the door. Surgery?

333
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,540
Is that a robot doctor?

334
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:05,540
I think we leave now. I don't think we have anything else to do here.

335
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,540
I think we can go.

336
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,540
Y, y, y.

337
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,540
Y, y, y.

338
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,540
Ysle. Ysle.

339
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,540
Ysle.

340
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,540
Y, y.

341
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,540
Y, y.

342
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,540
Oh.

343
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,540
Ni.

344
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,540
Ysle so nice.

345
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,540
Ysle.

346
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,540
Ysle.

347
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,540
Ysle?

348
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,540
Ysle?

349
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,540
Ysle.

350
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,540
Ysle.

351
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,540
Ysle.

352
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:33,060
I can't believe you fell back and got the defluxer with this now we can go find both

353
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:42,580
Let's go. Let's go. Welcome everyone and anyone who's now joining in. It's good to have you.

354
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,580
I hope that you'll have me.

355
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:56,580
This is hilarious.

356
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,460
Are they a doctor or a mechanic?

357
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:13,460
Since the majority of them don't even know how to fix other machinery,

358
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,180
I'd say they are robot doctor.

359
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:33,460
Oh, I can zoom in.

360
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:43,460
This place is creepy.

361
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:15,460
I don't see any way to open this gate. Can you take a look on the other side?

362
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,460
Of course.

363
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:35,460
I don't like what I'm seeing over there.

364
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:45,460
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

365
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:25,460
Disgusting. I sneezed. Did I sneeze? I didn't even notice, but I actually sneezed.

366
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:41,460
It's all icky, sticky, squelchy. Thank you.

367
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:51,460
Thank you.

368
01:02:55,460 --> 01:03:01,460
I've never been this far out of the slums with you here. I'm not even scared.

369
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:09,460
Are you guys not scared with me here?

370
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:13,460
Are you guys not scared?

371
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,460
They're watching us.

372
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:21,460
Look at it. It's watching us.

373
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:31,460
Are you guys not scared?

374
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:41,460
Are you guys not scared?

375
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:51,460
I'm not scared at all.

376
01:03:51,460 --> 01:04:01,460
I'm not scared at all.

377
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:11,460
Are you guys not scared?

378
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:39,460
All this old machinery is broken now. I think we can only open it manually.

379
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:49,460
Are you guys not scared?

380
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:59,460
Are you guys scared?

381
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:17,460
Quick. Jump below the door. It won't hold for long.

382
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:23,460
I got it. I'm going.

383
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:29,460
I can't go with you, but I won't stop looking for a way.

384
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:39,460
We better not. I don't want to leave Momo.

385
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:57,460
We're leaving you?

386
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:09,460
He wouldn't have made it in here anyways.

387
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:23,460
Oh my gosh.

388
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:49,460
Oh no, there's a robot.

389
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:59,460
Oh.

390
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:27,460
Oh no.

391
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:53,460
I'm not taking chances. I'm still scared.

392
01:07:53,460 --> 01:08:19,460
Oh my gosh.

393
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:31,460
I mean I can't go that way. What's over here? There's something over here?

394
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:41,460
A memory.

395
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:53,460
The sewer system. Yes, I remember now. Clean water was scarce.

396
01:08:53,460 --> 01:09:01,460
The city was supplied by a huge machinery that dug deep into the earth.

397
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:09,460
It was like everything else. It was rationed out to sustain people.

398
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:13,460
Oh my gosh. My brain is lagging.

399
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:25,460
Just like everything else, it was rationed out to sustain people during times of drought.

400
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:33,460
Oh boy.

401
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:37,460
Dyslexia is hitting me really hard right now.

402
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:45,460
Give me one second.

403
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:55,460
I can read.

404
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:59,460
The scientists showed me the blueprint of the water tanks.

405
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:11,460
They are huge and contain a whole building in them.

406
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:33,460
Is there anything else? No.

407
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:57,460
Oh.

408
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:05,460
Okay.

409
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:23,460
Is there any other memories? I don't want to miss a memory. No. Here.

410
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:27,460
It's so dangerous.

411
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:45,460
Can you cast a break out? I would be traumatized after dealing with pipes.

412
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:57,460
Oh boy.

413
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:03,460
So so. Thank you mom and mister Vondella to be.

414
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:13,460
If you're looking for praise. You've all been very, very good for me.

415
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:39,460
Good baby crabs. My sweet little things.

416
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:49,460
Can I just go this way? Can I just avoid them?

417
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:59,460
Oh oh oh shit.

418
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:09,460
I have to clear them out one by one.

419
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:19,460
Okay.

420
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:49,460
Okay.

421
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:59,460
Are you fine?

422
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:39,460
Get off me.

423
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:49,460
Get off me.

424
01:14:49,460 --> 01:15:13,460
Oh no.

425
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:21,460
What is this place? This looks extremely creepy.

426
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:35,460
Am I missing something? Am I missing something?

427
01:15:35,460 --> 01:16:01,460
I'm so scared. I'm procrastinating because I don't want to go home.

428
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:11,460
Can you avoid some of those? There's a lot of eggs. I can avoid some of the eggs. Probably not all of them because loud noises activate them.

429
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:25,460
So if I would have left a majority of those eggs out and then hit that lever, all of them probably would have been activated along with the ones coming out of the door.

430
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:35,460
And they also activate when you get really close to them.

431
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:53,460
What the fuck?

432
01:16:53,460 --> 01:17:03,460
Ah! Ah! Ah!

433
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:33,460
Oh shit!

434
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:51,460
Can I just run? Oh there's too many. This is so dangerous.

435
01:17:51,460 --> 01:18:01,460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

436
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:11,460
Can I just go?

437
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:31,460
Oh my god. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

438
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:40,460
OK. You're OK.

439
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:57,460
All of those terrifying.

440
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:15,460
Hold on.

441
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:44,460
Are they closed?

442
01:19:44,460 --> 01:20:13,460
Uh-oh.

443
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:24,460
Oh.

444
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:52,460
Oh no. Oh no. I walk them up, I walk them up, I walk them up. I walk them up, I walk them up, I walk them up.

01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,240
I don't like this

455
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:13,240
I don't like this at all

not Sheamus, Momo

468
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,240
imagine if Momo came with us

469
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:01,240
you think he would have survived this?

470
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,240
if Momo came with us

471
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,240
you think Momo would have survived?

472
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,240
come on

473
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,240

No, no, no! Please, please, please, please!

485
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:30,240
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please!

486
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:35,240
No!

487
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,240
How do you have run bad?

488
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,240
There's no way.

489
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,680
Youth

490
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:02,920
amddwch.

491
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:04,520
I'm going.. It's coming.

492
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:04,600
I'm going.

493
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:07,960
I'm doing...

494
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,800
no no no no no no no no no.

495
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,720
Come on..

496
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:14,600
Ar ingredient

497
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:16,280
so good.

498
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,240
O, yswet.

499
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,440
O, yswet.

500
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,240
No! No! No! No!

501
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,840
Go, go, go, go!

502
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,640
It's closing! It's closing!

503
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,040
I made it.

504
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,880
Oh, wake up!

505
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,680
Wake up!

506
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,680
Oh, okay.

507
01:25:54,360 --> 01:26:00,360
It was dark. I was alone. I felt like I was back in the network.

508
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,360
But you saved me. Thank you, friend.

509
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:13,880
During that month, power was rough on my core.

510
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:19,880
But the fluxer is completely destroyed now. I have to be careful.

511
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,880
No.

512
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,880
The fluxer was what made me brave without it. I am nothing.

513
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,880
Was there anything else?

514
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,880
So much water. So much wet.

515
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,880
I made it.

516
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,880
I'm here. Did I miss a memory?

517
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,880
I think I missed a memory.

518
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,880
I made it.

519
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,880
Traveller from the sewers.

520
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,880
I made it.

521
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,880
I made it.

522
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,880
I made it.

523
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:39,880
I made it.

524
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:41,880
I made it.

525
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,880
Traveller from the sewers.

526
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:45,880
I want to see one of you in ages.

527
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,880
Are you the one who contacted us earlier?

528
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,880
A little outsider?

529
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:55,880
Balsahar, the outsider, has been expecting you.

530
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:59,880
He's meditating at the top of our village.

531
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,880
Thank you.

532
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,880
Baladan.

533
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:07,880
Ant village. I think I missed a memory.

534
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:09,880
Let me see.

535
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:13,880
No.

536
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,880
I missed a memory.

537
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:19,880
Oh no.

538
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:27,880
I missed a memory.

539
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,880
I wonder what that memory was.

540
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,880
Oh, hang on.

541
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:47,080
ond? I'm not moving on. I think this crashed.

542
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:57,080
Yeah, this crashed. Give me one second.

543
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,880
I'm not moving on. I think this crashed. Give me one second.

544
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:25,880
Wow, hello. It's me. Mario.

545
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,880
Okay.

546
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:55,880
My only weapon is gone, you know? This machine, the scientist, has introduced one of the others.

547
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:03,880
He was sick. This was his last hope. He walked into the machine.

548
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:09,880
But I wasn't with him. He was alone. What was he doing?

549
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:19,880
Isn't that the machine that was in the room when we first got B12?

550
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:29,880
He uploaded himself into the computer and everything was different.

551
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:43,880
But the upload something went wrong. He was stuck for hundreds of years until a little cat appeared.

552
01:30:49,880 --> 01:31:01,880
Was it? It was me. I was the scientist. I was human.

553
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,880
I need a moment.

554
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:19,880
Oh no. Oh no.

555
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:38,880
I'm sorry. I need a moment. I don't feel like talking right now.

556
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:49,880
Oh, that's understandable. Go ahead. We just look around. Something scratch.

557
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:16,880
I get an achievement for that.

558
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,880
I'm a tree.

559
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:49,880
I'm a tree.

560
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:55,880
I'm a tree.

561
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,880
I'm a tree.

562
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:25,880
What else have I forgotten?

563
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:31,880
Unless I've had parents, friends. What happened to everyone?

564
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:39,880
I wanted to open the city, but is there even anyone left to say?

565
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:49,880
It's over here.

566
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:59,880
That's where I came from.

567
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,880
Up up below.

568
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:26,880
I blushed. Wait, I sneezed again? When did I sneeze? What? I don't... How come I never remember?

569
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:32,880
I don't remember sneezing. What is this?

570
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,880
I really sneezed.

571
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,880
Thank you.

572
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,880
Thank you.

573
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,880
I gotta need a scratchy.

574
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,880
I'm hungry.

575
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:36,880
I'm hungry. Why? I'm hungry. Why? Why?

576
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,880
I'm hungry.

577
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:48,880
Toast time. I want toast. I gotta go get bread though.

578
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,880
I'll get it after.

579
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,880
I'll get an orange. I don't have an orange.

580
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,880
What is this?

581
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,880
I'll get an orange.

582
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,880
My balls are hard.

583
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:30,880
Hey, don't you know not to interrupt a fellow during his transcendental meditation?

584
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:41,880
Oh, it's you. You were with Momo when we received a call earlier. I'm glad to meet you at last little outsider.

585
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:53,880
You know Momo and Doc, so you're already familiar with those outsiders. I miss them, and memory brings me peace.

586
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:11,880
Momo slyt, Momo staed yn y slums. I heard you helped find Doc in Clementine. She's in Midtown now.

587
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:21,880
If you still want to see the outside, she's the one who can get you there. Apparently she had some kind of plan to leave the city.

588
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:33,880
Here, take this. This is meaning you can never leave or her address in the back of this picture. Clementine's picture.

589
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:51,880
Come in a new item. To reach in Midtown, climb up our little village. It should be easy for a Dick Styrious, one like you.

590
01:37:51,880 --> 01:38:02,880
If you manage to reach the outside, you will be the very first. I would wish you good luck, but you don't need it. I believe in you.

591
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:10,880
He believes in me. Yeah.

592
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:26,880
If you had to pick one Pokemon as your partner, what would it be? Either Weed Cat or Lovatar. I really like Lovatar. I have a Lovatar stuffy.

593
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:36,880
Lovatar.

594
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:45,880
Weed Cat or Lovatar. Lovatar.

595
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:54,880
Or any of the Eevee evolutions.

596
01:38:54,880 --> 01:39:13,880
Especially the grass evolution of Eevee. It's my favorite evolution. It doesn't get much love, but I love it.

597
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:38,880
Leafeon. Yeah, Leafeon.

598
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:55,880
Sorry, sorry.

599
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:15,880
Did you know that Vaporeon is... Don't start with that here, alright? Don't start with that.

600
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:23,880
Don't start. I'm giving my eye on you.

601
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:33,880
Good night Azura. I hope you have fun. Good night to you too. Have a good night.

602
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:59,880
Mum.

603
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:09,880
I love Peter. I can't stop hearing him. Oh my gosh.

604
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:39,880
No.

605
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:18,880
Hang on. Give me a second.

606
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:28,880
I'm not falling asleep, I swear.

607
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:41,880
I'm not falling asleep. I'm looking at pizza.

608
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:25,880
I'm not falling asleep.

609
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:43,880
Let me stretch.

610
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:53,880
The eapiness is starting to hit me.

611
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:42,880
I'm getting pizza.

612
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:57,880
Yeah, we ordered a pizza.

613
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:06,880
Guys, I'm already done, so please get yourself a snack, water or something to drink. Get a blankie and get comfy.

614
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:15,880
Mine will probably take time to get here, but I'm going to get it.

615
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:22,880
I really shouldn't, but I've been craving a pizza for like two weeks.

616
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:37,880
I've been craving pizza since before they built when we were chatting about pizza in the chat. I still haven't forgotten.

617
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:52,880
I haven't had pizza since then. Even before that. I haven't had pizza in a long time.

618
01:46:52,880 --> 01:47:02,880
Pizza is very expensive over here. It's very expensive.

619
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:21,880
It's fine. You don't worry about it. It's fine.

620
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:31,880
Let me put this in the way you keep playing.

621
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:54,880
It's fine.

622
01:47:54,880 --> 01:48:14,880
No, it's a bad drink.

623
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:44,880
It's fine.

624
01:48:44,880 --> 01:49:10,880
No break.

625
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:27,880
Let me grab this.

626
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:37,880
Oh my God, I am a river. You don't have to do that. Thank you. Thank you for the 30. Thank you.

627
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:45,880
You're insane. Thank you.

628
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:17,880
Thank you.

629
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:49,880
Oh, how cute. My legs are, I feel like jelly. It was sitting for so long.

630
01:50:49,880 --> 01:51:06,880
Okay.

631
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:15,880
Is it an honor? Is it an honor for you?

632
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:25,880
First week young ladies will, that's so sweet of you. Oh my God. That's so very sweet of you. Thank you.

633
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:37,880
Thank you. Thank you. Let's continue with the game while we wait for foods to come.

634
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:47,880
Let me take another small break.

635
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:53,880
Where is the cave? Sorry for shutting down earlier.

636
01:51:53,880 --> 01:52:02,880
I'm human, probably the last in the world. Now it was left to me.

637
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:10,880
So much has come back to me. How much have I forgotten?

638
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:22,880
Maybe if we find something, we can restore my memories and get you back home at the same time.

639
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:33,880
So we can go back down and find out more, the companions are head onward to Mattel.

640
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:38,880
You should go find Clementine. Oh, nothing has happened to her.

641
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:44,880
Clementine at the top of our village and find a path to reach Mattel.

642
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:54,880
But before we do that, we're going to have a look around.

643
01:52:54,880 --> 01:53:00,880
Oh, I want to go down. I want to go down. I want to look around for us.

644
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:10,880
Now we can talk to people, I think.

645
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:17,880
This food is actually horrible, but it's the only thing around.

646
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:31,880
I'll have to unscrew my front casing if I keep eating this trash.

647
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:42,880
Maybe I should open my own place because I really can't get any worse than that.

648
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:52,880
A GPU done, all you can eat buffet. Imagine that. I can eat that stuff forever.

649
01:53:53,880 --> 01:54:05,880
People call me the Teng Chef. I specialize in upcycling leftovers.

650
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:14,880
Raman. Raman C45. That's my secret ingredient.

651
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:32,880
Who told you about the secret ingredient?

652
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:41,880
It's a kitchen.

653
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:46,880
Can I go down there? I can.

654
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:50,880
Mine. Thanks.

655
01:54:50,880 --> 01:55:11,880
Flower.

656
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:20,880
Where's the stove?

657
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:31,880
It's a cute little area to lay down.

658
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:39,880
It's another one of those spots.

659
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:53,880
Raman. Raman GPU done.

660
01:55:53,880 --> 01:56:00,880
I've only ever had udon once, but I didn't have all the other stuff in it. It was just the noodles.

661
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:17,880
I've only had udon noodles. I haven't had the other stuff they put in it.

662
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:28,880
I can't eat pre-packaged ramen noodles because it messes with my stomach for some reason.

663
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:36,880
My stomach can't digest the packaged ramen, so I end up like it comes back up after like 10 minutes.

664
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:46,880
I can not even very long. It hurts. It makes my tummy hurt a lot.

665
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:57,880
So I can only eat actual freshly cooked ramen.

666
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:04,880
I used to eat at a certain place.

667
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:10,880
They make the best ramen. It tastes so good.

668
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:16,880
It's the only place that I can actually stomach eating it.

669
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:26,880
Other than that, I can't stomach anything else.

670
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:46,880
Raman. Raman.

671
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:58,880
We don't have many Raman places that are made traditionally.

672
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:07,880
There are people who are learning how to make it, but they are making it.

673
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:11,880
It doesn't taste good.

674
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:17,880
It doesn't taste very good. It doesn't taste like traditional ramen at all.

675
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:26,880
That's why there's only so many places that I will go to to make ramen really good, in my opinion.

676
01:58:41,880 --> 01:59:03,880
Raman. Raman.

677
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:18,880
Yeah. It isn't many places.

678
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:22,880
I have a car too.

679
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:28,880
One thing I don't like about my city is that there are no dedicated ramen places.

680
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:33,880
What are they about to see in the world though?

681
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:38,880
Or soba. I like yaki soba.

682
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:42,880
But I think that's the only packaged one that I can eat.

683
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:46,880
I can eat packaged yaki soba.

684
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:50,880
I think it's made very differently.

685
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:54,880
I can eat that and it tastes so good.

686
01:59:54,880 --> 02:00:09,880
I wish I had the one I could tell you.

687
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:19,880
Zori reviews.

688
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:25,880
I got a few very few ramen places around here, but they're just okay, sadly.

689
02:00:25,880 --> 02:00:35,880
This is a way of life.

690
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:39,880
I have a few sushi places. We have everything.

691
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:45,880
I wish we had more.

692
02:00:45,880 --> 02:01:04,880
More Asian cuisine.

693
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:09,880
Oh hello there. It has been so long since we've had a visitor.

694
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:12,880
We'll accept those dimsirks of course.

695
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:17,880
Imagine if we could harness their power.

696
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:20,880
Have them run in a wheel or something.

697
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:26,880
Just to waste the potential.

698
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:33,880
When I grow up, I want to be great like Aunt Clementine.

699
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:37,880
I look so new.

700
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:42,880
I look like such a new robot.

701
02:01:42,880 --> 02:02:02,880
I wanted to explore like she did, but the grown-ups verbatised the antithlet.

702
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:17,880
Is there anything else around here?

703
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:27,880
Zia's electric zerk everywhere.

704
02:02:27,880 --> 02:02:49,880
Why don't you wake up?

705
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:55,880
We have a lot of robots that are pretty rusty.

706
02:02:55,880 --> 02:03:02,880
All the old robots are kind of rusty.

707
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:06,880
They have a little bit of rust on them.

708
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:15,880
In this language, a companion robot made it up from scratch. How impressive.

709
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:19,880
I remember it happening when I was in the network.

710
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:29,880
I don't know when exactly, but at one time all the communications started to switch to the symbols.

711
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:34,880
I was stuck in a computer and alone for a long time.

712
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:41,880
So I translated every symbol in word one by one until I was able to understand everything.

713
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:49,880
Now that I'm out, I know their language. I'm curious to hear all they have to say.

714
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:57,880
I hate that gap. I can't believe I missed a memory.

715
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:27,880
Does this wake them up?

716
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:57,880
The painter.

717
02:04:57,880 --> 02:05:07,880
Mae. Do you know there are more than 900 sads of white pant?

718
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:26,880
I don't tell anyone, but I'm creating my own shade of pant.

719
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:31,880
I'm calling it garbage brown.

720
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:36,880
Ew. White garbage brown.

721
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:40,880
Hang on, this is a door. I'll be right back.

722
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:44,880
Robot. Robot, robot.

723

882

I just want like a purple-ish pink and I like this color of that.

883
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:21,720
One of my favorite colors.

884
02:16:25,480 --> 02:16:31,880
I was a bellbut many cycles ago but I repurposed myself into a treasure hunter.

885
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:40,200
Don't be fooled by the sound of it. It can be hard and gruesome just like this arm I just found.

886
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:47,640
Oh, I mean they lost an arm. Oh, they did. They found a new arm.

887
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:52,280
For a fellow may he rest in peace.

888
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:06,120
Isn't it like lavender? Yeah, it's called periwinkle.

889
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:16,440
It's a color that tricks you. It's my favorite color that tricks you in the spectrum because it looks like it's purple, but it's actually blue.

890
02:17:32,840 --> 02:17:34,840
It's my favorite color.

891
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:36,840
I love the color.

892
02:17:55,320 --> 02:17:58,760
Is that what I call a junk? I call it treasure.

893
02:17:58,760 --> 02:18:09,240
Yeah, it's one of my favorite, favorite colors. I like baby colors like baby blue,

894
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:19,400
yellow, but really, really light yellow, orange, but super light. I like the little baby color spectrum.

895
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:23,800
It's my favorite.

896
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:28,520
It's gay, can I? Do I just go back the same way?

897
02:18:39,560 --> 02:18:41,560
This way.

898
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:53,080
Indeed. Sorry for leaving early again. Oh, that's okay. Don't worry about it.

899
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:59,400

902
02:20:17,320 --> 02:20:19,880

921

02:22:52,760 --> 02:23:02,920
even to this day and she's older than me

923
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:28,920

942
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:12,040
White plant.

943
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:18,040
I hate it.

944
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:22,040
Is there an area I can go to?

02:26:24,040 --> 02:26:27,040
Really there's another area. Am I missing?

946

02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:41,040

Can I jump down from there?

950
02:27:02,040 --> 02:27:04,040
Is it possible?

951
02:27:04,040 --> 02:27:06,040

954
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:13,040
Can I jump down from there?

955
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:15,040
Jump on the television?

956
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:17,040
To wake him up?

957
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:23,040

958
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:25,040

Nothing over here?

977
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:31,040
Am I supposed to be up here? Oh, this way.

978
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:37,040
Hello?

02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:45,040

I have only some small and agile look good get them for you.

1015
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:01,680
Hello, I'll call her. Thanks buddy.

1016
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:05,040
You got any other one for me please? Please?

1017
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:08,800
Oh wow, you're so pretty. Thank you.

1018
02:31:09,680 --> 02:31:13,120
Can you find me another one for me? Please? Please?

1019
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:16,560
Hi, hello. Welcome then. Hi.

1020
02:31:17,440 --> 02:31:18,240
How are you?

1021
02:31:20,480 --> 02:31:23,600
Oh, I heard it's a rare plant. Thank you.

1022
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:28,960
Bona mam. Thank you so much here as a reward to my badge.

1023
02:31:34,880 --> 02:31:41,280
It looks so good. It looks so good with it. It looks, it looks, it looks.

1024
02:31:46,480 --> 02:31:51,600
Not you, but it as in like the thingy that's on my back. It looks so good with it.

1025
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:54,960
All right. I'll take care now. I'll see you friend.

1026
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:18,240
I'm bored. I'm claiming that I used the whole classes here so you learn a lot of cool stuff.

1027
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:28,960
It's like a little classroom. That's so cute.

1028
02:32:52,400 --> 02:33:03,360
Oh. Wait, am I supposed to jump on that?

1029
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:10,960
No? Oh. It just took me all the way back. No.

1030
02:33:18,240 --> 02:33:19,120
I'll go back up.

1031
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:37,760
Only up, only up. Wait, can I knock these over? Oh.

1032
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:44,400
I want to knock those over. Do you want to jump over there? I can't.

1033
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:48,560
Is it? It's a second.

1034
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:30,560
You guys see uncle and son? Can you tell me that everyone's a sister? Sure. You can do that.

1035
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:40,000
Up to daisy, up to daisy.

1036
02:34:42,400 --> 02:34:48,000
I feel like I'm forgetting something. Is there memory that I forgot about? No, I think there's only one.

1037
02:34:48,000 --> 02:35:03,440
I go up here.

1038
02:35:03,440 --> 02:35:20,880
It looks like the sun up there, but you know it's not. Fake white lights.

1039
02:35:24,640 --> 02:35:27,680
Is it normal for a cat to be obsessed with socks?

1040
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:31,120
I suppose so.

1041
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:39,280
I know my cat used to be obsessed with my shoes.

1042
02:35:42,240 --> 02:35:45,120
He'd lay on my shoes all the time.

1043
02:35:57,680 --> 02:36:15,120
I'm sorry for a fourth size of pizza. I'm having a fourth slice. This kills me.

1044
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:25,040
I'm going to drink.

1045
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:42,560
You like seafood?

1046
02:36:43,360 --> 02:36:52,000
You like seafood?

1047
02:36:52,000 --> 02:37:09,440
You do? You do like seafood?

1048
02:37:09,440 --> 02:37:20,880
You do? You do like seafood?

1049
02:37:39,440 --> 02:38:08,880
No, I spilled it everywhere. No, my blanket.

1050
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:12,480
No, I got to suck it out of the blanket.

1051
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:30,880
No, it's all wet.

1052
02:38:30,880 --> 02:38:52,320
I'm back. You're all no fun.

1053
02:38:52,320 --> 02:39:02,400
I like the little detail of the tail sticking up.

1054
02:39:05,040 --> 02:39:08,880
The tail sticking up literally for a cat is a greeting, by the way.

1055
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:13,360
When a cat's tail sticks up, it's literally saying hello.

1056
02:39:14,480 --> 02:39:21,440
So every time robot comes out, the tail sticks up. I think that's so cute. Such a cute detail.

1057
02:39:22,320 --> 02:39:28,160
No manners.

1058
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:34,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

1059
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:51,200
I completely forgotten this kind of transportation existence.

1060
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:56,960
You can ride anywhere in the city. People used to take it to go to work.

1061
02:39:57,520 --> 02:40:02,400
I used to take it too. Every morning after saying goodbye to my family at home.

1062
02:40:05,360 --> 02:40:12,240
I remember I was doing this for them. They were gone now. It was a long ago.

1063
02:40:15,360 --> 02:40:19,360
You wanted to see the outside, but does that even matter anymore?

1064
02:40:20,320 --> 02:40:22,800
What happened to them? What happened to everyone?

1065
02:40:22,960 --> 02:40:33,760
Anyway, we're near Mitano. Let's find this Clementine.

1066
02:40:38,800 --> 02:40:41,520
We can have a picture of her. We have a picture of her.

1067
02:40:42,160 --> 02:40:48,640
We can show it so some of the companions are on here. Maybe they'll point us in the right direction.

1068
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:59,600
Make your memory.

1069
02:41:10,640 --> 02:41:15,600
That's a transdation.

1070
02:41:18,640 --> 02:41:27,600
That's a transdation.

1071
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:42,560
I don't know what to say.

1072
02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:48,560
I don't know what to say.

1073
02:41:48,560 --> 02:41:52,560
Translay it.

1074
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:58,080
Clothes due to pandemic restrictions, please do not enter.

1075
02:41:58,080 --> 02:42:02,160
Any violations of rules can result heavy prison sentence.

1076
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:06,160
Were the people in the lower section sick?

1077
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:13,520
Were they sick?

1078
02:42:18,880 --> 02:42:19,520
I remember.

1079
02:42:22,560 --> 02:42:26,880
There's so many books here.

1080
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:34,640
Deterian, test legacy, the ethics of artificial intelligence.

1081
02:42:35,360 --> 02:42:39,840
I recognise some of these books. I have a library.

1082
02:42:40,640 --> 02:42:45,040
I remember nothing was quiet like the smell of books in the turn of payage.

1083
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:47,920
It was a feeling almost like comfort.

1084
02:42:47,920 --> 02:42:56,880
A book was like spending time with someone.

1085
02:42:56,880 --> 02:43:10,880
Miao. Miao. Miao. Miao. Miao. Miao.

1086
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:13,680
Hee hee. What a cute face.

1087
02:43:17,280 --> 02:43:21,840
Lidoc.

1088
02:43:27,760 --> 02:43:35,840
I know something.

1089
02:43:40,880 --> 02:43:51,840
I don't know what to say.

1090
02:43:51,840 --> 02:44:01,840
I don't know what to say.

1091
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:12,800
I don't know what to say.

1092
02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:25,200
Translation wanted.

1093
02:44:25,200 --> 02:44:30,800
Clementine, trouble maker, outsider, rebellious, please report any sightings.

1094
02:44:32,400 --> 02:44:32,800
Yeah.

1095
02:44:34,400 --> 02:44:36,000
I told you five times.

1096
02:44:37,200 --> 02:44:39,280
You can't run around like that.

1097
02:44:39,280 --> 02:44:40,240
It's dangerous.

1098
02:44:41,680 --> 02:44:44,960
Hey, this is the first time I've seen this kind of robot.

1099
02:44:44,960 --> 02:44:46,080
He looks so fluffy.

1100
02:44:49,120 --> 02:44:52,640
Oh, it's the girl displayed on this one screen, right?

1101
02:44:53,360 --> 02:44:54,720
You should ask somebody else.

1102
02:44:54,720 --> 02:44:57,440
I'm just busy with yours here to know anything.

1103
02:45:02,640 --> 02:45:04,000
No, I already read that.

1104
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,720
Oh, can I talk to the little guy?

1105
02:45:08,080 --> 02:45:08,880
Little guy?

1106
02:45:08,880 --> 02:45:09,120
No.

1107
02:45:13,200 --> 02:45:15,520
Don't worry about trash.

1108
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:18,160
Nicocorporatio takes care of everything.

1109
02:45:18,160 --> 02:45:19,680
They didn't take care of anything.

1110
02:45:20,480 --> 02:45:20,800
Ruh.

1111
02:45:20,800 --> 02:45:31,280
Oh.

1112
02:45:31,280 --> 02:45:35,280
Is there another?

1113
02:45:35,280 --> 02:45:47,760
I arrest them.

1114
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:49,760
What's this?

1115
02:45:49,760 --> 02:45:55,760
Access to lower level is restricted due to organic life hazards.

1116
02:45:55,760 --> 02:45:57,760
Please keep out of this area.

1117
02:45:57,760 --> 02:45:59,360
I closed the elevator.

1118
02:45:59,360 --> 02:46:02,240
This is the elevator that leads down below, isn't it?

1119
02:46:12,800 --> 02:46:15,200
Well, yeah, look.

1120
02:46:17,360 --> 02:46:19,200
I'm right below inside the elevator.

1121
02:46:21,120 --> 02:46:21,840
It's dumb.

1122
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:22,880
It's the town.

1123
02:46:23,840 --> 02:46:31,360
They're down there.

1124
02:46:31,360 --> 02:46:35,360
Hee.

1125
02:46:37,360 --> 02:46:39,360
Do you hear that down below?

1126
02:46:39,360 --> 02:46:42,160
That ebb, that flow?

1127
02:46:42,160 --> 02:46:44,160
Is that he haunts me?

1128
02:46:44,160 --> 02:46:45,360
It haunts me?

1129
02:46:45,360 --> 02:46:46,560
I don't hear that.

1130
02:46:46,560 --> 02:46:48,160
I don't hear that.

1131
02:46:48,160 --> 02:46:49,440
I don't hear that.

1132
02:46:49,440 --> 02:46:50,560
I don't hear that.

1133
02:46:50,560 --> 02:46:51,440
City haunts me?

1134
02:46:51,440 --> 02:46:52,240
It haunts me?

1135
02:46:54,480 --> 02:46:54,960
Probably.

1136
02:46:58,160 --> 02:47:00,320
Caz buzzed for an only sad.

1137
02:47:00,320 --> 02:47:01,280
Why is he sad?

1138
02:47:03,040 --> 02:47:04,160
Won't he sad?

1139
02:47:08,080 --> 02:47:09,520
Pan a team up for that.

1140
02:47:14,640 --> 02:47:19,600
That trash, that trash city blast is no joke.

1141
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:24,960
EverydayNekoCorp is doing this relentless work on me.

1142
02:47:27,440 --> 02:47:28,720
Oh, Clementine?

1143
02:47:28,720 --> 02:47:30,160
Yeah, I used to hang out with her.

1144
02:47:30,720 --> 02:47:31,840
She wanted to live.

1145
02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:35,520
She was a breeze and then she flew.

1146
02:47:36,400 --> 02:47:37,760
She's a wanted person now.

1147
02:47:38,560 --> 02:47:39,680
I'm too heavy for me.

1148
02:47:41,280 --> 02:47:41,840
Hear that?

1149
02:47:42,480 --> 02:47:44,320
That ebb, that flow?

1150
02:47:50,560 --> 02:47:52,560
I don't hear that.

1151
02:48:06,560 --> 02:48:08,000
How did I get over here?

1152
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:09,280
Oh, what's over there?

1153
02:48:20,560 --> 02:48:22,640
Did I hear that?

1154
02:48:38,800 --> 02:48:41,760
It's the transmitter tower over there.

1155
02:48:41,760 --> 02:48:43,760
That's where I turned on the power.

1156
02:48:50,560 --> 02:48:54,560

1169
02:50:01,580 --> 02:50:03,580
.. it's very creepy music

1170
02:50:18,560 --> 02:50:46,840
I don't know the jingle started to remind me of Undertale, this is now sort of reminding

1171
02:50:46,840 --> 02:51:08,240
of Undertale, there's a tiny bit, some of the parts of the jingle, this is the tale with

1172
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:34,160
underground, well you are underground, top of fucks, doesn't know how to say that word, I won't even try.

1173
02:51:38,240 --> 02:52:06,640
Resting in this barren city fills you with determination,

1174
02:52:06,640 --> 02:52:29,760
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

1175
02:52:29,760 --> 02:52:52,880
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

1176
02:52:52,880 --> 02:53:22,000
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

1177
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:45,120
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

1178
02:53:45,120 --> 02:54:08,240
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

1179
02:54:08,240 --> 02:54:31,360
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

1180
02:54:31,360 --> 02:54:56,480
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

1181
02:54:56,480 --> 02:55:21,600
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

1182
02:55:21,600 --> 02:55:46,720
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

1183
02:55:46,720 --> 02:56:11,840
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

1184
02:56:11,840 --> 02:56:26,960
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

1185
02:56:26,960 --> 02:56:52,080
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

1186
02:56:52,080 --> 02:57:07,200
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

1187
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:32,560
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, oh wait, i know, I don't know, I don't know,

1188
02:57:32,560 --> 02:57:34,560
Hello?

1189
02:57:45,560 --> 02:57:47,560
Excuse me?

1190
02:57:53,560 --> 02:57:55,560
Drilling nothing over here?

1191
02:57:55,560 --> 02:58:01,560
There's something supposed to be over here?

1192
02:58:06,560 --> 02:58:08,560
I'm a little confused.

1193
02:58:10,560 --> 02:58:12,560
There's a bunch of boxes to jump on.

1194
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:23,560
Please state your identity as a peacemaker.

1195
02:58:26,560 --> 02:58:35,560
Co-operate, or we will have to transfer you to jail and reboot you.

1196
02:58:38,560 --> 02:58:41,560
Please leave me alone. I'm not the one you're looking for.

1197
02:58:44,560 --> 02:58:48,560
If you're looking for Clement Simon, I'm sure she's hiding in the residence.

1198
02:58:55,560 --> 02:58:59,560
Midtown, this looks so cool.

1199
02:58:59,560 --> 02:59:00,560
This is what I mean.

1200
02:59:00,560 --> 02:59:04,560
This is what I mean by living in a place like this.

1201
02:59:04,560 --> 02:59:05,560
Looks really cool.

1202
02:59:05,560 --> 02:59:06,560
Doesn't it?

1203
02:59:08,560 --> 02:59:10,560
This looks so cool.

1204
02:59:13,560 --> 02:59:14,560
I.

1205
02:59:14,560 --> 02:59:28,560
Consider this tomorrow if I replace my arm with another robotic arm.

1206
02:59:28,560 --> 02:59:31,560
Then the next day my other arm too.

1207
02:59:31,560 --> 02:59:36,560
Then my body and so on until I replace all my parts and upgrade my software.

1208
02:59:36,560 --> 02:59:39,560
Will I be the same robot you're talking to now?

1209
02:59:39,560 --> 02:59:43,560
If you maintain the same memory as I think so.

1210
02:59:44,560 --> 02:59:47,560
Oh hey, what are you showing me right now?

1211
02:59:48,560 --> 02:59:50,560
A bunch of people I don't know.

1212
02:59:50,560 --> 02:59:55,560
My guess is that they probably live in the massive housing building further uptown.

1213
02:59:56,560 --> 02:59:58,560
Do what you want with that.

1214
03:00:00,560 --> 03:00:03,560
Thanks, Mr. Bloody.

1215
03:00:06,560 --> 03:00:08,560
Destruction.

1216
03:00:09,560 --> 03:00:12,560
Destruction, no.

1217
03:00:14,560 --> 03:00:16,560
Something else in here.

1218
03:00:17,560 --> 03:00:19,560
Meow.

1219
03:00:41,560 --> 03:00:43,560
Wonton ni ar?

1220
03:00:46,560 --> 03:00:53,560
Hey, I'm off to work. See you later.

1221
03:00:53,560 --> 03:00:57,560
Okay honey, be cautious of sentinels.

1222
03:00:57,560 --> 03:01:02,560
They're quite, they're quick to make a rest for no reason, for no good reason.

1223
03:01:02,560 --> 03:01:05,560
Don't worry about me, babe, I'm good.

1224
03:01:17,560 --> 03:01:19,560
Hello.

1225
03:01:22,560 --> 03:01:24,560
Gray.

1226
03:01:24,560 --> 03:01:30,560
At Nygle Corp, we work all day long together the ways and send it downstairs,

1227
03:01:30,560 --> 03:01:33,560
where they recycle and repurpose it.

1228
03:01:35,560 --> 03:01:41,560
Speaking of downstairs, it has been a while since we had news from them.

1229
03:01:42,560 --> 03:01:45,560
We'll picture that one.

1230
03:01:45,560 --> 03:01:48,560
Hey, is that an address on the back?

1231
03:01:48,560 --> 03:01:54,560
First symbol is the street, and then there is a floor and a door number.

1232
03:01:54,560 --> 03:01:56,560
It's gonna be easy to find.

1233
03:01:56,560 --> 03:01:58,560
Ready?

1234
03:01:58,560 --> 03:02:00,560
How do you...

1235
03:02:02,560 --> 03:02:04,560
Uh, examine.

1236
03:02:05,560 --> 03:02:07,560
Oh.

1237
03:02:07,560 --> 03:02:09,560
Oh.

1238
03:02:11,560 --> 03:02:13,560
They said a...

1239
03:02:13,560 --> 03:02:15,560
Come on, I can do this.

1240
03:02:15,560 --> 03:02:17,560
Ha ha.

1241
03:02:17,560 --> 03:02:21,560
A street, a street door number, and then what?

1242
03:02:21,560 --> 03:02:23,560
What was it?

1243
03:02:29,560 --> 03:02:33,560
Whatever that symbol is, three five?

1244
03:02:37,560 --> 03:02:39,560
Floor.

1245
03:02:42,560 --> 03:02:44,560
Flo.

1246
03:02:45,560 --> 03:02:48,560
Sorry, little one, you can't play over here.

1247
03:02:51,560 --> 03:02:56,560
The Nygle Corp factory is no place for a little fussball idea.

1248
03:02:56,560 --> 03:03:02,560
Access is restricted, but only for a little while.

1249
03:03:02,560 --> 03:03:07,560
If you can wait a few years, we'll open right back up.

1250
03:03:07,560 --> 03:03:10,560
Wait, I didn't show in the picture.

1251
03:03:12,560 --> 03:03:15,560
Cool picture, is that address on the back?

1252
03:03:15,560 --> 03:03:18,560
Oh, you're just gonna tell me the same thing.

1253
03:03:19,560 --> 03:03:21,560
Ha ha.

1254
03:03:44,560 --> 03:03:46,560
D感謝 wel yn cael ei gael.

1267
03:04:37,460 --> 03:04:58,060
Hi. Clubs closed. Get lost? Oh yeah? Who are you? Police? Everyone's looking for her.

1268
03:04:58,060 --> 03:05:03,060
I'll let her in if that's what you want to know.

1269
03:05:07,060 --> 03:05:09,060
Ooh, what's down there?

1270
03:05:12,060 --> 03:05:16,060
This merchant crook sold me a faulty battery the other day.

1271
03:05:17,060 --> 03:05:22,060
Now he just prisions not to hear me. Every time I try to confront him.

1272
03:05:22,060 --> 03:05:28,060
If he wasn't for the Sentinel on patrol he'd end up a spare part.

1273
03:05:34,060 --> 03:05:39,060
I don't think he has any. I think he needs to be charged.

1274
03:05:46,060 --> 03:05:47,060
Translate.

1275
03:05:47,060 --> 03:06:00,060
Code is a 2458 or 8542. 2458 or 8542. Looks like it's backwards.

1276
03:06:03,060 --> 03:06:06,060
Tiaw, remember that? You guys are smart.

1277
03:06:07,060 --> 03:06:13,060
Oh wait, it's this. What was it? What was it again?

1278
03:06:13,060 --> 03:06:14,060
Again?

1279
03:06:25,060 --> 03:06:27,060
458? Oh.

1280
03:06:27,060 --> 03:06:42,060
That didn't work. 22548. 22548. Nope, that didn't work.

1281
03:06:43,060 --> 03:06:58,060
8458. Oh, wait. Not in the dictionary.

1282
03:06:59,060 --> 03:07:12,060
8452? Oh. 8452. Ha!

1283
03:07:16,060 --> 03:07:20,060
I can't do no bad. I can't have a cat bad.

1284
03:07:21,060 --> 03:07:23,060
I am cool.

1285
03:07:33,060 --> 03:07:35,060
What? I'm a little hippie.

1286
03:07:50,060 --> 03:07:52,060
I'm a little hippie.

1287
03:08:20,060 --> 03:08:25,060
Can I go any further up or anything like that?

1288
03:08:50,060 --> 03:09:16,060
Surgery and then a bunch of robot parts.

1289
03:09:20,060 --> 03:09:35,060
You've been in the city below? I had a friend there.

1290
03:09:35,060 --> 03:09:39,060
Fifi. I haven't seen him in ages. Did we see someone named Fifi?

1291
03:09:45,060 --> 03:09:47,060
Down in the city below?

1292
03:09:50,060 --> 03:09:54,060
I don't remember seeing anyone named Fifi.

1293
03:10:21,060 --> 03:10:27,060
I don't remember. I don't remember. Me too.

1294
03:10:31,060 --> 03:10:36,060
I don't know what the downstairs neighbors are up to.

1295
03:10:36,060 --> 03:10:40,060
I keep hearing bazaar and hammer noises.

1296
03:10:41,060 --> 03:10:43,060
Is the doctor?

1297
03:10:50,060 --> 03:10:52,060
I don't know.

1298
03:11:03,060 --> 03:11:06,060
I didn't say I could jump on their head.

1299
03:11:06,060 --> 03:11:10,060
Oh no. I thought that was an option too.

1300
03:11:10,060 --> 03:11:12,060
That'd be funny.

1301
03:11:16,060 --> 03:11:18,060
Translate.

1302
03:11:19,060 --> 03:11:22,060
Announcement.

1303
03:11:23,060 --> 03:11:29,060
If you're looking for some company to talk about poetry, I live behind the elevator.

1304
03:11:29,060 --> 03:11:31,060
Bonobot.

1305
03:11:31,060 --> 03:11:36,060
I went and talked to them.

1306
03:11:48,060 --> 03:12:12,060
I used to own a bar. It was the coziest place around here until I took a screwdriver in the knee and it's closed now.

1307
03:12:18,060 --> 03:12:24,060
Even if this guy bums me out, he's my only customer. Try not to scare him away.

1308
03:12:37,060 --> 03:12:39,060
Big city.

1309
03:12:42,060 --> 03:12:46,060
Sorry shops closed. I'm waiting for the delivery guys.

1310
03:12:46,060 --> 03:12:50,060
It seems they're taking their sweet time.

1311
03:12:50,060 --> 03:12:58,060
What's this picture? Oh I know her. She was one of those people who all obsessed with the outside.

1312
03:13:16,060 --> 03:13:18,060
I don't know.

1313
03:13:18,060 --> 03:13:20,060
I don't know.

1314
03:13:26,060 --> 03:13:28,060
I don't know.

1315
03:13:28,060 --> 03:13:30,060
Oh.

1316
03:13:43,060 --> 03:13:46,060
I'm feeling really epi.

1317
03:13:46,060 --> 03:13:56,060
It's this triniest shop in the meantime where the shopkeeper is pretty grumpy.

1318
03:13:56,060 --> 03:14:02,060
What a nice looking picture. Is that an address in the back?

1319
03:14:02,060 --> 03:14:05,060
Yeah I know what the address is.

1320
03:14:11,060 --> 03:14:14,060
I thought there was a door here.

1321
03:14:16,060 --> 03:14:29,060
Are you one of those young punks listening to loud music all day? No.

1322
03:14:29,060 --> 03:14:34,060
Don't touch anything. Don't make any noise. Don't ask for your credit.

1323
03:14:34,060 --> 03:14:40,060
Whatever. I was going to ask you for anything anyways.

1324
03:14:40,060 --> 03:14:42,060
Whatever.

1325
03:14:42,060 --> 03:14:45,060
It's over here.

1326
03:15:12,060 --> 03:15:22,060
I don't have anything to put in there.

1327
03:15:29,060 --> 03:15:31,060
What was this?

1328
03:15:35,060 --> 03:15:37,060
Where am I?

1329
03:15:42,060 --> 03:15:46,060
It wouldn't let me the option to knock it down then pop up.

1330
03:15:50,060 --> 03:15:52,060
It's another shop.

1331
03:16:00,060 --> 03:16:02,060
What's this?

1332
03:16:02,060 --> 03:16:04,060
Translate.

1333
03:16:05,060 --> 03:16:10,060
Is it hell with the symptoms along with the outsiders?

1334
03:16:16,060 --> 03:16:18,060
Chat.

1335
03:16:18,060 --> 03:16:20,060
Chat.

1336
03:16:24,060 --> 03:16:26,060
I'm tired.

1337
03:16:30,060 --> 03:16:32,060
I'm really tired.

1338
03:16:34,060 --> 03:16:36,060
I'm really tired.

1339
03:16:43,060 --> 03:16:45,060
I'm so tired.

1340
03:16:56,060 --> 03:16:59,060
I thought I could finish this.

1341
03:17:00,060 --> 03:17:03,060
I could finish this in one sitting.

1342
03:17:03,060 --> 03:17:05,060
But I did not get any sleep.

1343
03:17:06,060 --> 03:17:08,060
But you could soon.

1344
03:17:11,060 --> 03:17:14,060
I really need to go to sleep.

1345
03:17:14,060 --> 03:17:16,060
I gotta go to bed.

1346
03:17:18,060 --> 03:17:21,060
I have part three. Let's go.

1347
03:17:21,060 --> 03:17:27,060
Don't ever believe in me again.

1348
03:17:27,060 --> 03:17:29,060
I can do it.

1349
03:17:30,060 --> 03:17:32,060
I can do it.

1350
03:17:33,060 --> 03:17:36,060
Work hard again later.

1351
03:17:43,060 --> 03:17:47,060
It's so hard. I cannot keep my eyes open.

1352
03:17:47,060 --> 03:17:55,060
If I had gotten some really good sleep, baby, I could have gone on a little longer.

1353
03:17:55,060 --> 03:17:57,060
But I haven't.

1354
03:17:57,060 --> 03:18:01,060
I didn't sleep very good last night.

1355
03:18:04,060 --> 03:18:06,060
The lady is getting a sleep.

1356
03:18:06,060 --> 03:18:10,060
I have so much on my mind that was bothering me.

1357
03:18:10,060 --> 03:18:13,060
How do you save the game?

1358
03:18:13,060 --> 03:18:15,060
Is there a way to save?

1359
03:18:17,060 --> 03:18:21,060
I don't know if it gets to a checkpoint or something.

1360
03:18:23,060 --> 03:18:26,060
Where's the next checkpoint?

1361
03:18:26,060 --> 03:18:29,060
I can save the game.

1362
03:18:43,060 --> 03:18:45,060
I can save the game.

1363
03:18:58,060 --> 03:19:00,060
I can save the game.

1364
03:19:00,060 --> 03:19:13,060
Is there really nothing over there?

1365
03:19:13,060 --> 03:19:15,060
Is it here?

1366
03:19:15,060 --> 03:19:17,060
Or is it here?

1367
03:19:30,060 --> 03:19:32,060
What's this?

1368
03:19:32,060 --> 03:19:34,060
It's a jail.

1369
03:20:01,060 --> 03:20:06,060
I can't believe that.

1370
03:20:10,060 --> 03:20:15,060
If they threw them in jail, then their battery ran out.

1371
03:20:15,060 --> 03:20:18,060
It's so horrible.

1372
03:20:30,060 --> 03:20:35,060
Did the game save when I picked up the badge?

1373
03:20:35,060 --> 03:20:37,060
I didn't look.

1374
03:20:37,060 --> 03:20:40,060
I didn't check.

1375
03:20:54,060 --> 03:20:57,060
How do you check?

1376
03:20:58,060 --> 03:21:00,060
49 seconds.

1377
03:21:00,060 --> 03:21:02,060
We're fine.

1378
03:21:10,060 --> 03:21:14,060
We'll play the rest in the next one.

1379
03:21:14,060 --> 03:21:16,060
I'm so tired.

1380
03:21:16,060 --> 03:21:18,060
I'm so sorry, everyone.

1381
03:21:18,060 --> 03:21:20,060
I'm so exhausted.

1382
03:21:20,060 --> 03:21:23,060
I just really needed some sleep.

1383
03:21:24,060 --> 03:21:27,060
It's time for bed.

1384
03:21:34,060 --> 03:21:36,060
It's a fun game, though.

1385
03:21:36,060 --> 03:21:38,060
I really like it a lot.

1386
03:21:38,060 --> 03:21:41,060
It's super fun.

1387
03:21:53,060 --> 03:21:55,060
It's a fun game.

1388
03:21:55,060 --> 03:21:57,060
It's a fun game.

1389
03:21:57,060 --> 03:21:59,060
It's a fun game.

1390
03:21:59,060 --> 03:22:01,060
It's a fun game.

1391
03:22:01,060 --> 03:22:03,060
It's a fun game.

1392
03:22:03,060 --> 03:22:05,060
It's a fun game.

1393
03:22:05,060 --> 03:22:07,060
It's a fun game.

1394
03:22:07,060 --> 03:22:09,060
It's a fun game.

1395
03:22:09,060 --> 03:22:11,060
It's a fun game.

1396
03:22:11,060 --> 03:22:13,060
It's a fun game.

1397
03:22:13,060 --> 03:22:15,060
It's a fun game.

1398
03:22:15,060 --> 03:22:17,060
It's a fun game.

1399
03:22:17,060 --> 03:22:19,060
It's a fun game.

1400
03:22:19,060 --> 03:22:21,060
It's a fun game.

1401
03:22:21,060 --> 03:22:23,060
It's a fun game.

1402
03:22:23,060 --> 03:22:25,060
It's a fun game.

1403
03:22:25,060 --> 03:22:27,060
It's a fun game.

1404
03:22:27,060 --> 03:22:29,060
It's a fun game.

1405
03:22:29,060 --> 03:22:31,060
It's a fun game.

1406
03:22:31,060 --> 03:22:33,060
It's a fun game.

1407
03:22:33,060 --> 03:22:35,060
It's a fun game.

1408
03:22:35,060 --> 03:22:37,060
It's a fun game.

1409
03:22:37,060 --> 03:22:39,060
It's a fun game.

1410
03:22:39,060 --> 03:22:41,060
It's a fun game.

1411
03:22:43,060 --> 03:22:45,060
It's a fun game.

1412
03:22:45,060 --> 03:22:47,060
It's a fun game.

1413
03:22:47,060 --> 03:22:49,060
It's a fun game

1414
03:22:49,060 --> 03:22:51,060
It's a fun game.

1415
03:22:51,060 --> 03:22:53,060
It's a fun game.

1416
03:22:53,060 --> 03:22:55,060
It's a fun game.

1417
03:22:55,060 --> 03:22:57,060
It's a fun game.

1418
03:22:57,060 --> 03:22:59,060
It's a fun game.

1419
03:22:59,060 --> 03:23:01,060
It's a fun game.

1420
03:23:01,060 --> 03:23:03,060
It's a fun game.

1421
03:23:03,060 --> 03:23:05,060
It's a fun game.

1422
03:23:05,060 --> 03:23:07,060
It's a fun game.

1423
03:23:07,060 --> 03:23:09,060
It's a fun game.

1424
03:23:09,060 --> 03:23:11,060
It's a fun game.

1425
03:23:11,060 --> 03:23:13,060
Can anyone read my poetry?

1426
03:23:13,060 --> 03:23:15,060
Can anyone read my poetry?

1427
03:23:15,060 --> 03:23:17,060
I can see you today.

1428
03:23:17,060 --> 03:23:19,060
Well, well.

1429
03:23:19,060 --> 03:23:21,060
Okay.

1430
03:23:45,060 --> 03:23:47,060
Ychydig.

1431
03:23:47,060 --> 03:23:49,060
Ychydig.

1432
03:23:49,060 --> 03:23:51,060
Ychydig.

1433
03:23:51,060 --> 03:23:53,060
Ychydig.

1434
03:23:53,060 --> 03:23:55,060
Ychydig.

1435
03:23:55,060 --> 03:23:57,060
Ychydig.

1436
03:23:57,060 --> 03:23:59,060
Ychydig.

1437
03:23:59,060 --> 03:24:01,060
Ychydig.

1438
03:24:01,060 --> 03:24:03,060
Ychydig.

1439
03:24:03,060 --> 03:24:05,060
Ychydig.

1440
03:24:05,060 --> 03:24:07,060
Ychydig.

1441
03:24:09,060 --> 03:24:11,060
Ychydig.

1442
03:24:11,060 --> 03:24:13,060
Ychydig.

1443
03:24:13,060 --> 03:24:15,060
Ychydig.

1444
03:24:15,060 --> 03:24:17,060
Ychydig.

1445
03:24:19,060 --> 03:24:21,060
Ychydig.

1446
03:24:21,060 --> 03:24:23,060
Ychydig.

1447
03:24:23,060 --> 03:24:25,060
Ychydig.

1448
03:24:25,060 --> 03:24:27,060
Ychydig.

1449
03:24:27,060 --> 03:24:29,060
Ychydig.

1450
03:24:29,060 --> 03:24:31,060
Ychydig.

1451
03:24:31,060 --> 03:24:33,060
Ychydig.

1452
03:24:33,060 --> 03:24:35,060
Ychydig.

1453
03:24:35,060 --> 03:24:37,060
Ychydig.

1454
03:24:37,060 --> 03:24:39,060
Ychydig.

1455
03:24:39,060 --> 03:24:41,060
Ychydig.

1456
03:24:41,060 --> 03:24:50,180
I went through Helen back to fix my settings to make sure that my sound sounded okay and then

1457
03:24:50,180 --> 03:25:03,220
my volume was okay. It could be hard, it wasn't too loud, it was too quiet. I finally fixed my audio

1458
03:25:03,220 --> 03:25:15,780
and I think it's fine. Finally okay now. No strange noises, no buzzing, no nothing like that

1459
03:25:15,780 --> 03:25:21,460
because none of that should be in it. None of that should be in it. Am I hearing background noises

1460
03:25:21,460 --> 03:25:32,020
every now and then, but excuse me, that's okay. My god, it's good, it's been great honestly,

1461
03:25:32,020 --> 03:25:48,900
it's good, yay. I'm happy, almost happy. Oh my goodness. And, and, and guess what, guess what, guess

1462
03:25:48,900 --> 03:25:54,420
what? Oh my god, guess what? It's going on, never sorry, please don't forget to take your meds. Oh,

1463
03:25:54,420 --> 03:25:59,860
I have completely forgot about that. Why? Yeah, I'll take my meds, I'll take on the meds right now,

1464
03:25:59,860 --> 03:26:00,580
right now, right now.

1465
03:26:00,740 --> 03:26:22,660
I don't think everything's on your stream, but it's good for the time I was here. I'm glad, I'm good.

1466
03:26:23,540 --> 03:26:34,580
Yes, guess what? Also, also, also, I haven't crashed, I haven't crashed or my internet hasn't

1467
03:26:34,580 --> 03:26:53,700
went out. This whole stream, is that amazing? I didn't crash, I didn't go out.

1468
03:26:56,420 --> 03:27:00,740
Yay, we had a really good, really good stream.

1469
03:27:04,580 --> 03:27:20,180
I love W. Yeah, we had an extreme score. I only think I wish me being very happy. Very happy.

1470
03:27:23,780 --> 03:27:30,820
I promise I'll sleep. I'll be, I'll be up for a little bit and then I'm gonna just go sleep.

1471
03:27:31,540 --> 03:27:39,540
I'm so tired. I was up all night because I was so sad. I was so sad last night.

1472
03:27:43,060 --> 03:27:47,620
I must have, I should have been way more careful.

1473
03:27:49,460 --> 03:27:56,820
And then I would have probably got monetized much earlier. But I was, I was being naughty.

1474
03:27:56,820 --> 03:28:04,660
I guess you could say. I was being the stinker. I was the stinker.

1475
03:28:17,300 --> 03:28:21,620
I was so sad and I was just constantly thinking about it last night.

1476
03:28:22,580 --> 03:28:29,860
I ended up doing all my, I had an audio setting last night. I was just doing audio.

1477
03:28:30,900 --> 03:28:35,060
As you know, audio found out why my volume was so messed up.

1478
03:28:36,340 --> 03:28:40,020
Hawaii sounded so different. I finally figured it out.

1479
03:28:40,740 --> 03:28:47,700
Set it up and it removed stuff. All my settings I had previously was okay.

1480
03:28:47,700 --> 03:28:51,620
I couldn't figure out why everything else was messed up.

1481
03:28:53,700 --> 03:28:56,420
Come to find out that it was just my window settings.

1482
03:28:57,540 --> 03:29:05,780
My window volume went down for some reason and I fixed that up. That's all fixed up.

1483
03:29:08,020 --> 03:29:13,460
And it was causing, like everything else was causing ducking and stuff. So

1484
03:29:13,460 --> 03:29:20,980
if the other girls need help with their audio constantly ducking or peaking,

1485
03:29:21,860 --> 03:29:25,220
I can help with it since I worked on it all night.

1486
03:29:30,020 --> 03:29:31,620
It wasn't volume mixer.

1487
03:29:31,620 --> 03:29:43,780
Cut out with the bleeding hires. Yeah, we could all cut out.

1488
03:29:47,060 --> 03:29:50,340
No one expects you to marathon streams every day.

1489
03:29:50,340 --> 03:29:54,420
I like streaming for a long time though. It keeps me very distracted.

1490
03:29:54,500 --> 03:30:04,260
The world is a terrible place. Streaming is very fun. Very fun, very distracting.

1491
03:30:06,580 --> 03:30:10,740
And I like being that distraction for other people as well,

1492
03:30:11,300 --> 03:30:17,380
where you could just come in, relax, get cozy, focus on your voice, and then get some tears.

1493
03:30:25,220 --> 03:30:40,420
I might do sleepy time stories for videos for you guys instead of live streams.

1494
03:30:41,220 --> 03:30:46,020
Like just video videos of ASMR slayup.

1495
03:30:46,980 --> 03:30:59,060
Aw, thank you. That's so sweet. Thank you so much for the $5 tip they had all for fun.

1496
03:30:59,060 --> 03:31:09,620
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

1497
03:31:16,020 --> 03:31:23,620
Mm-mm.

1498
03:31:27,700 --> 03:31:29,620
Okay, are you with those two?

1499
03:31:30,740 --> 03:31:37,700
Here, my best distraction. I'm glad. I'm glad I can be that space for you guys.

1500
03:31:38,740 --> 03:31:43,060
I want to be that safe space. I might not be the extreme

1501
03:31:43,780 --> 03:31:48,100
lwyd, like the other girls, because I know they can be a little

1502
03:31:49,540 --> 03:31:59,540
intense. I can always be that nice, relaxing, comfy zone that you can retreat to.

1503
03:32:00,260 --> 03:32:06,820
If the intensity is too much for you, you can always come to me and mama will take care of you.

1504
03:32:06,820 --> 03:32:12,980
Mm-hmm. That's taking. No, I won't take it right now.

1505
03:32:36,820 --> 03:32:42,980
Wow.

1506
03:32:48,020 --> 03:33:04,980
That's good. I really need to pick up my pain meds, though. My shoulder has been killing me.

1507
03:33:06,820 --> 03:33:13,780
Oh, thank you.

1508
03:33:18,020 --> 03:33:22,980
You're just so sweet. Oh, my gosh. You're so sweet. Thank you, Peony,

1509
03:33:23,540 --> 03:33:30,980
because I still don't know how to pronounce your name correctly. Peony. Peony.

1510
03:33:30,980 --> 03:33:40,900
Thank you for the $4 tip, Peony. I'm so glad you enjoy my strength.

1511
03:33:41,780 --> 03:33:45,940
And yes, Black Wolf. Black Wolf, thank you so much for the $4 tip.

1512
03:33:46,820 --> 03:33:50,900
Every time because I was with Mommy. I'm glad you enjoy it.

1513
03:33:50,900 --> 03:34:01,860
I'm so sorry, Peony.

1514
03:34:13,940 --> 03:34:18,180
I have taken my meds if anyone is asking. I'm wondering they have been taken.

1515
03:34:18,180 --> 03:34:29,140
And when you get your soft voice going, my back just shimmers. That's it.

1516
03:34:29,140 --> 03:34:45,140
Oh, am I glasses? Yeah. I need to pick those up, too.

1517
03:34:45,140 --> 03:35:01,140
That's true. I'll call them tomorrow. I promise. Just remind me. I'll do it. I'll call them tomorrow.

1518
03:35:01,140 --> 03:35:11,140
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow.

1519
03:35:23,700 --> 03:35:28,100
I love being here so much just because it's so calm and relaxing. Letters can be too much

1520
03:35:28,100 --> 03:35:36,020
at times. That's why I like it here. I'm glad I've been kind of beating myself up to be like the other girls.

1521
03:35:37,300 --> 03:35:44,100
Like, I don't know. I just don't have it in me to be that way when I'm live, you know?

1522
03:35:44,740 --> 03:35:52,100
I'm a little embarrassed and I get really red with face burns.

1523
03:35:52,100 --> 03:36:06,100
But being like this is very easy for me. It's natural. It's just who I am. I just be myself when I stream live.

1524
03:36:06,100 --> 03:36:16,100
It'd be me and then I like it comfy and being as sweet to you guys. But you're so sweet to me.

1525
03:36:16,660 --> 03:36:25,300
Well, I don't know. As to purposely trying to be loose with them as it's my thing.

1526
03:36:27,620 --> 03:36:35,540
Especially while live. But doing like recordings and stuff is easy. I can record. I can do that.

1527
03:36:37,380 --> 03:36:42,100
I don't have too many eyes on me watching me.

1528
03:36:46,100 --> 03:36:48,100
What?

1529
03:37:02,340 --> 03:37:10,100
You're doing great. Nothing of yourself about it. So that makes you feel comfy. You know, I enjoy the comfy.

1530
03:37:10,100 --> 03:37:20,100
Yeah, it's just I've already gotten a few morals wishing that I was more fluid by so many morals.

1531
03:37:20,100 --> 03:37:27,700
I haven't really sorry. I haven't I've been reading everyone's morals. So many people sent me some really nice things, but

1532
03:37:28,500 --> 03:37:38,100
I haven't been able to respond to a majority of morals lately because I think I've flooded with quite a few of things that got me a little

1533
03:37:38,100 --> 03:37:43,860
sad. So I've been avoiding the morals for the time being.

1534
03:37:48,100 --> 03:37:55,300
But it's perfectly fine. They're not bad. They're not extremely bad. It's just me being the little overthinker that I am.

1535
03:37:56,020 --> 03:37:58,660
That's all. Nothing extremely bad.

1536
03:37:58,660 --> 03:38:08,820
Just a lot of morals. Every time I go through like 50 morals, there's like 100 more.

1537
03:38:09,620 --> 03:38:15,780
I go through like 25 morals and there's another 100 more. I can't. It's so many.

1538
03:38:16,260 --> 03:38:23,220
And then I have to skip some and I feel bad skipping morals. It's so many morals.

1539
03:38:23,220 --> 03:38:27,780
It's so many.

1540
03:38:27,780 --> 03:38:46,740
I

1541
03:38:47,140 --> 03:38:54,700
Mi'n ddana yn bwysig mae hwnna o'r tîngr o gyfo.

03:38:54,980 --> 03:39:14,380
Snw'n hefyd yn ystod drosh o

1543
03:39:14,380 --> 03:39:17,660
I'm glad. I like the way you guys react whenever I hit you with something.

1544
03:39:22,940 --> 03:39:29,100
The way you guys fall. Have hiccups. The way you guys fall and crumple.

1545
03:39:33,020 --> 03:39:35,660
Ravel in my feet.

1546
03:39:35,660 --> 03:39:37,660
I'm glad.

1547
03:39:41,340 --> 03:39:43,340
Yeah.

1548
03:39:44,620 --> 03:39:47,900
As long as I'm after a carrot, I am pretty much.

1549
03:39:51,340 --> 03:39:53,340
You love gremlin also.

1550
03:40:06,460 --> 03:40:08,460
Mmm. That's fine.

1551
03:40:11,020 --> 03:40:17,420
There's like many great emails at work. There's so many of them. Yeah. They're hard.

1552
03:40:19,820 --> 03:40:25,260
You guys, there's one. There's a small amount. I will try. I'll do my absolute best.

1553
03:40:26,860 --> 03:40:33,100
I just feel so bad because I answered so many morals, but I never used marshmallow before.

1554
03:40:33,900 --> 03:40:37,580
So I didn't know how to make them public, nor like or

1555
03:40:38,300 --> 03:40:43,900
send morals before, but now I know and I can try.

1556
03:40:44,940 --> 03:40:46,940
I'll try again.

1557
03:40:49,500 --> 03:40:51,500
I'll try again.

1558
03:40:51,500 --> 03:41:04,460
Mmm. I'll read them out to my own pairs.

1559
03:41:06,700 --> 03:41:11,820
Your voice is loud enough for me. It's just my normal voice.

1560
03:41:15,420 --> 03:41:17,420
What a man.

1561
03:41:19,100 --> 03:41:21,100
Melt from her words.

1562
03:41:22,300 --> 03:41:27,340
Melt. Melt away. Melt for me.

1563
03:41:31,580 --> 03:41:35,500
Mwami. Mwai a crumbel anasura saeth anethang.

1564
03:41:40,540 --> 03:41:42,540
Come on, melt away.

1565
03:41:43,340 --> 03:41:47,100
You might need a higher person. Just sort your morals.

1566
03:41:48,540 --> 03:41:50,300
Possibly.

1567
03:41:50,300 --> 03:41:56,540
But I like going through them. I just feel, I just have this urge not to miss out on anything.

1568
03:41:57,500 --> 03:42:02,220
And I don't know. Maybe I'll have to think on it.

1569
03:42:05,020 --> 03:42:10,380
But I'm sure that we are kind of already like, I can like

1570
03:42:12,620 --> 03:42:14,620
get that figured out regardless.

1571
03:42:16,060 --> 03:42:18,060
So it'll be fine.

1572
03:42:18,860 --> 03:42:23,900
I'm sure I can take up any kind of offers

1573
03:42:25,180 --> 03:42:27,180
that they can help me out with.

1574
03:42:27,740 --> 03:42:32,060
Manzan and Shrani has done an amazing job thus far with helping me out.

1575
03:42:32,700 --> 03:42:36,540
I'm a very clumsy person and I think I have like the worst luck in the world.

1576
03:42:37,260 --> 03:42:40,220
The worst absolutely fucked world luck in the world.

1577
03:42:40,700 --> 03:42:43,500
And it's been like that for years ever since I was young.

1578
03:42:44,380 --> 03:42:46,220
I've gotten hurt.

1579
03:42:46,220 --> 03:42:48,700
Restrained as accidents have been around me.

1580
03:42:49,980 --> 03:42:52,620
I cause big things to happen on accident.

1581
03:42:54,540 --> 03:42:59,580
This has been like a thing that has been running on with me for like a long, long, long time.

1582
03:43:00,540 --> 03:43:02,540
So yeah.

1583
03:43:04,300 --> 03:43:07,340
All I can do is power through it because I'm used to it.

1584
03:43:07,820 --> 03:43:13,180
But I feel so bad when other people get involved and then messes with them.

1585
03:43:14,060 --> 03:43:15,180
As well.

1586
03:43:15,180 --> 03:43:17,340
If it's just me, it's fine.

1587
03:43:17,340 --> 03:43:19,980
Yeah, I'll be sad about it, but it is what it is.

1588
03:43:29,500 --> 03:43:31,500
I know I defy as a puddle.

1589
03:43:32,300 --> 03:43:33,580
I'll be doing okay.

1590
03:43:33,580 --> 03:43:36,300
Don't do things that make you uncomfortable.

1591
03:43:36,300 --> 03:43:39,820
Be comfy and we'll be comfy.

1592
03:43:39,820 --> 03:43:40,540
I'm comfy.

1593
03:43:41,100 --> 03:43:41,820
I'm very comfy.

1594
03:43:41,820 --> 03:43:44,460
Today was a really nice comfy stream today.

1595
03:43:44,460 --> 03:43:46,380
So I really enjoyed the day.

1596
03:43:46,380 --> 03:43:47,260
A lot of fun.

1597
03:43:48,140 --> 03:43:53,580
I'm just very sleepy and I'll be sleeping very soon.

1598
03:43:53,580 --> 03:43:57,340
Once this medication starts kicking in, I'm definitely going to go head to head.

1599
03:44:04,700 --> 03:44:07,900
We want to be good boys and girls for you, Mumu.

1600
03:44:07,900 --> 03:44:09,420
You are good boys.

1601
03:44:09,980 --> 03:44:11,740
And you are good girls.

1602
03:44:12,380 --> 03:44:16,540
I'm very proud of you for being here and supporting your Mumu.

1603
03:44:19,020 --> 03:44:21,180
You're all very brave and very good.

1604
03:44:23,820 --> 03:44:25,660
Take it at your own pace, Mumu.

1605
03:44:25,660 --> 03:44:26,220
I will.

1606
03:44:27,340 --> 03:44:29,340
Are you today or more yet?

1607
03:44:29,340 --> 03:44:30,060
Just a bit.

1608
03:44:31,660 --> 03:44:33,020
Well, I'm lucky to find you.

1609
03:44:34,540 --> 03:44:35,260
That's so sweet.

1610
03:44:35,260 --> 03:44:35,740
Thank you.

1611
03:44:40,220 --> 03:44:43,340
I'll be here to support you 100% of the way.

1612
03:44:43,900 --> 03:44:44,460
Thank you.

1613
03:44:55,980 --> 03:44:58,940
I can only wish and hope that is the case.

1614
03:45:00,140 --> 03:45:01,580
I can only hope.

1615
03:45:03,260 --> 03:45:06,460
I'd rather be kind than mean to gain good luck.

1616
03:45:07,260 --> 03:45:13,020
If it just means that it's just me getting at fault, then that's fine.

1617
03:45:13,660 --> 03:45:16,460
But I just don't like when other people get affected.

1618
03:45:17,900 --> 03:45:21,500
Thank you so much for the $4 tip the iron reaper.

1619
03:45:21,500 --> 03:45:22,300
Thank you so much.

1620
03:45:22,300 --> 03:45:22,620
Thank you.

1621
03:45:22,620 --> 03:45:23,100
Thank you.

1622
03:45:32,700 --> 03:45:33,820
I love your goddess.

1623
03:45:33,820 --> 03:45:34,380
That's why.

1624
03:45:34,380 --> 03:45:35,020
Thank you.

1625
03:45:35,020 --> 03:45:36,060
Maximum comfort.

1626
03:45:37,820 --> 03:45:40,380
Will you can get a great sleep tonight?

1627
03:45:40,380 --> 03:45:41,660
I'm very sure I will.

1628
03:45:42,940 --> 03:45:45,900
I am going to just sleep tonight.

1629
03:45:46,620 --> 03:45:48,140
You guys got me this fan.

1630
03:45:48,140 --> 03:45:49,420
I have a toaster.

1631
03:45:49,420 --> 03:45:50,620
I've been eating toast.

1632
03:45:50,620 --> 03:45:52,140
I've been actually eating some food.

1633
03:45:53,820 --> 03:45:55,580
Though I caved and got pizza,

1634
03:45:56,220 --> 03:46:00,140
but I have so much more pizza left over and this can last me for a few days.

1635
03:46:01,020 --> 03:46:02,860
I'll make sure to stretch it out.

1636
03:46:02,940 --> 03:46:06,380
Even though I ate like four slices and three cheese sticks.

1637
03:46:10,300 --> 03:46:10,940
That's fine.

1638
03:46:12,300 --> 03:46:15,340
I guess stretch the rest out for the rest of the days.

1639
03:46:22,380 --> 03:46:25,100
Can we get a good night kiss before you go?

1640
03:46:25,100 --> 03:46:25,660
Yeah, sure.

1641
03:46:25,660 --> 03:46:26,620
I can do that for you.

1642
03:46:28,940 --> 03:46:30,380
But it will have to be a quick one.

1643
03:46:33,660 --> 03:46:34,460
There you go.

1644
03:46:36,620 --> 03:46:42,140
I'm really looking forward to what you have planned for ASMR videos and stuff like that.

1645
03:46:42,140 --> 03:46:47,500
Most of it's just going to be some of the stuff I already talked about.

1646
03:46:48,780 --> 03:46:53,260
And I was really, really looking forward to doing the workout ASMRs, but

1647
03:46:54,860 --> 03:46:56,460
I hope you enjoyed it.

1648
03:46:56,460 --> 03:46:58,460
I'll see you in the next video.

1649
03:47:02,860 --> 03:47:06,620
With YouTube being the way it's being right now, I don't think that's a really wise idea.

1650
03:47:07,420 --> 03:47:12,220
So we'll have to put that on hold for a while until it seems safe to do so.

1651
03:47:13,660 --> 03:47:16,540
For now, I'll stick to doing regular ASMRs.

1652
03:47:17,420 --> 03:47:21,740
I'm trying to find some triggers for you guys that I can do,

1653
03:47:21,740 --> 03:47:28,620
but I'll probably mostly praising and taking in requests of things you want me to say.

1654
03:47:28,700 --> 03:47:29,820
Because I'll do that then.

1655
03:47:31,660 --> 03:47:32,300
Request.

1656
03:47:33,500 --> 03:47:37,260
And some petting and brushing.

1657
03:47:38,300 --> 03:47:44,060
And I have bubble wrap, plastic licking and tapping.

1658
03:47:44,060 --> 03:47:47,420
I don't really have much to tap with,

1659
03:47:49,740 --> 03:47:52,060
but I can do tapping and stuff like that.

1660
03:47:53,180 --> 03:47:54,220
Oh, and heartbeats.

1661
03:47:54,220 --> 03:47:58,460
Thank you to heartbeats for you guys.

1662
03:48:02,940 --> 03:48:06,780
If you're ever feeling bad just remember we are always here for you in our world.

1663
03:48:06,780 --> 03:48:07,500
Thank you.

1664
03:48:07,500 --> 03:48:10,220
I'm so happy to have all of you here.

1665
03:48:10,940 --> 03:48:13,660
My sweet little bleeding hearts.

1666
03:48:14,620 --> 03:48:15,980
My sweet sweet babies.

1667
03:48:15,980 --> 03:48:23,020
Thank you all so much for all of your support and my endeavours.

1668
03:48:25,020 --> 03:48:27,020
Mmm.

1669
03:48:30,700 --> 03:48:33,900
Hopefully you'll get the monetization soon.

1670
03:48:33,900 --> 03:48:37,740
Hopefully, but it'll probably take quite some time.

1671
03:48:38,460 --> 03:48:42,620
So I hope you're all able to wait for me.

1672
03:48:43,820 --> 03:48:45,100
Wait for me please.

1673
03:48:46,940 --> 03:48:51,740
Really sorry that I wasn't more prepared.

1674
03:48:54,620 --> 03:48:56,140
For the monetization.

1675
03:48:56,140 --> 03:48:56,940
I'm really sorry.

1676
03:49:02,460 --> 03:49:04,380
I want you to say you're good.

1677
03:49:05,740 --> 03:49:09,420
I'll feel as long as you request it.

1678
03:49:10,140 --> 03:49:11,020
I can do that.

1679
03:49:20,460 --> 03:49:22,380
Heartbeats are one of my favourites.

1680
03:49:22,380 --> 03:49:23,260
They help me calm.

1681
03:49:23,820 --> 03:49:24,620
I'm glad.

1682
03:49:26,620 --> 03:49:27,420
I'll wait.

1683
03:49:27,420 --> 03:49:29,420
I'll wait for you as long as it takes.

1684
03:49:30,140 --> 03:49:30,780
Wait.

1685
03:49:30,780 --> 03:49:31,660
I'm glad.

1686
03:49:31,660 --> 03:49:32,220
Thank you.

1687
03:49:32,860 --> 03:49:33,500
I love you.

1688
03:49:36,300 --> 03:49:37,180
In the meantime.

1689
03:49:45,820 --> 03:49:46,860
In the meantime.

1690
03:49:46,860 --> 03:49:57,580
Let us see who we can read for tonight.

1691
03:49:59,260 --> 03:50:00,380
I believe we can read

1692
03:50:05,340 --> 03:50:07,340
Mercerys, Mercy Live.

1693
03:50:08,380 --> 03:50:09,660
Oh, just not.

1694
03:50:11,100 --> 03:50:11,660
Is she not?

1695
03:50:12,300 --> 03:50:13,580
I have to refresh the page.

1696
03:50:14,700 --> 03:50:16,140
So let me, you know.

1697
03:50:17,820 --> 03:50:20,940
Well, nobody's live.

1698
03:50:21,980 --> 03:50:23,020
Nobody's live.

1699
03:50:29,420 --> 03:50:31,020
We can read into Aimee.

1700
03:50:34,060 --> 03:50:37,420
Aimee from Yumi Plus.

1701
03:50:39,500 --> 03:50:41,420
From Yumi Plus we'll read into Aimee.

1702
03:50:42,060 --> 03:50:45,420
This is my first read that isn't within

1703
03:50:46,860 --> 03:50:47,420
aimee.

1704
03:50:48,860 --> 03:50:53,260
It's not within aimee alor.

1705
03:50:55,180 --> 03:50:57,340
I almost forgot my own company's name.

1706
03:50:59,100 --> 03:51:00,780
Well, I'm really unsleepy.

1707
03:51:12,460 --> 03:51:14,300
That means you have to stay right?

1708
03:51:14,300 --> 03:51:14,540
No.

1709
03:51:14,540 --> 03:51:15,100
No.

1710
03:51:16,780 --> 03:51:19,660
On those day I have to go get a cleave.

1711
03:51:19,660 --> 03:51:25,020
I'll be streaming tomorrow some supermarket simulator.

1712
03:51:25,580 --> 03:51:26,700
And we'll have some more.

1713
03:51:27,340 --> 03:51:29,340
I'm going to bit my lip just now.

1714
03:51:31,340 --> 03:51:34,140
We'll have some more cozy time together.

1715
03:51:40,940 --> 03:51:41,900
I really bit my lip.

1716
03:51:44,540 --> 03:51:54,140
So, let's read into them.

1717
03:51:54,140 --> 03:51:57,260
And via Zora, via Zora, via Zora.

1718
03:51:57,260 --> 03:51:58,940

I'm really sorry if any of my audio has been really boopy

1731
03:52:49,740 --> 03:52:54,300
in any of the videos and stuff.

1732
03:52:55,580 --> 03:52:57,180
I was really bad with audio.

1733
03:52:57,180 --> 03:52:59,740
And over time, I'll definitely get better.

1734
03:52:59,740 --> 03:53:00,860
So please understand.

1735
03:53:00,860 --> 03:53:05,260
I'm really sorry if anything hasn't been up to your expectations.

1736
03:53:06,220 --> 03:53:07,100
I'm really sorry.

1737
03:53:10,620 --> 03:53:13,180
So, have a really good night everyone.

1738
03:53:13,180 --> 03:53:14,700
I hope I'm not forgetting anything.

1739
03:53:16,380 --> 03:53:18,380
And I'll see you guys tomorrow, okay?

1740
03:53:21,740 --> 03:53:24,940
Good night, my sweet loves, my sweet pleading hearts.

1741
03:53:26,540 --> 03:53:27,420
Good night, good night.

1742
03:53:31,820 --> 03:53:33,420
Night.

1743
03:53:35,500 --> 03:53:36,220
Bye.

1744
03:53:37,740 --> 03:53:40,380
I wanna miss you till tomorrow.

1745
03:53:40,380 --> 03:53:41,820
I'll think about you.

1746
03:53:41,820 --> 03:53:43,100
I dream about you.

1747
03:53:43,900 --> 03:53:44,860
Dream about me.
