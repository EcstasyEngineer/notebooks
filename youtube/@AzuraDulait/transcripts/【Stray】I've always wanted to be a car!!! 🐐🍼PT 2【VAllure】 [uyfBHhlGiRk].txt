I am glad you are all doing really well.
I am doing okay.
I have some
some things
that we can talk about before we start.
Okay?
Oh wow!
Welcome in Penpal.
Hi Penpal.
Thank you Emmy for the red.
Welcome in everyone.
How are you all?
Hi hi.
Hi hi.
Hi hi. Welcome in. Welcome in.
I hope your stream was really fun.
I think it was your monetization stream.
Monetization celebration.
Congratulations.
Congratulations Emmy. Yay.
Hello.
Thank you.
Thank you thank you.
Yeah it was super fun.
I am glad you had fun!
It's so good.
While speaking of monetisation, though we'll probably have to wait a little longer, I'll have to take even extra steps to being a little more careful.
That also includes no more singing on stream as well, so we've got to be careful.
I got copyrighted by some fake singing for just acapella singing, which isn't because of just the copyright itself, it interferes with stuff.
I got copyrighted three times.
Youtube is strict against it, but they're also strict against the scammers, the fake people, copyrighting stuff that isn't actually theirs, so we'll just have to wait till things are safer, to start doing stuff again.
Thank you so much for the 6th dollar, the beer.
Otter.
Biscotti?
So you see your name?
I think I butcher that.
Like so bad.
So I'll be even extra careful.
Let me turn on my light.
I just realised it's really dark.
I head.
I head.
I head.
Your tube.
Your womb.
Yeah, it's a little poopy, but it's our head.
No worries.
All we can do is continue streaming like normal.
And enjoy us playing and stuff.
I'm just at.
I head.

Thank you, appreciate you
thank you, thank you
Very sweet, and I appreciate all of you
I am, thank you. I don't really know how to put into words my feelings. I'm really bad
with expressing how I feel. So I just kind of just power through everything because that's what
I'm used to doing. I'm not really good at emotions because I get really, really, really emotional
and I get nervous and then I don't want to get nervous and then I'll freak out and then I'll cry
and I'll be a baby and I want to be a baby. So you gotta be strong, me strong,
mama strong because if mama isn't strong then who is gonna be strong?
Mama has to be the strongest.
Play league if you want to. That's okay. I want to play straight today.
I really do. I want to play straight.
Yeah, it's car simulator.
Car simulator.
Thank you. Thank you all for fun. I appreciate it so much. Thank you friends.
That's $5 to pay. That's very sweet of you. I'm happy that you all stay and stick by me.
I may not be doing so well and I may be like the extreme smallest.
Thank you. I had hope so. I really do hope they do. Thank you Phoenix.
Hang on.
I feel like there was something else I was supposed to have mentioned. I completely
forgot. Don't mind my heart rate. My heart rate is like crazy high. It's fine, okay?
It's fine. Do not be concerned about it. It's perfectly fine.
A combination of not really sleeping and I had a thought on my mind so I didn't really get much sleep.
I tried but I couldn't so it's just not on my heart rate, okay? Okay, okay.
I don't want you guys to constantly tell me to relax unless I really need to.
I'll say so otherwise, okay? I don't want you guys to be worried. It makes me a little sad when you
guys are extremely worried about me. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine, okay?
All right.
I would hope you would trust me.
All right.
Wow.
Ndo.
I didn't turn this on.
Uh oh.
Ie, we're fine. We're doing things.
So, this is part two of stray. If you guys haven't seen the start stray yet, make sure you watch part one.
So, remember to watch part one of this game session.
Okay, so this is portal. We're continuing from the last stream.
If you guys haven't already seen that, okay?
Ie, hang on. That's very strange.
It never did that before. Now it's doing it. That's really weird.
Okay, that's fine, I guess. When I click off the video, the sound goes away.
I want that to come back. How do you bring that back?
I know some games have it, and I know some games don't.
Oh, they have a thing where you can turn off and cap that.
Oh, for the distance though.
Oh, that's so cute.
Pause on focus? Pause on focus? Where is that?
This? No, that's not. That's not doing it either. It's so strange. Let me change the mode as well.
So, I'm not super bright in your face.
Dim lighting.
Oh, wait. Am I supposed to go back and then do it, accept it, and then do it?
No, that didn't work.
Now this is definitely going to be the last, I think.
I couldn't get through this. I promise. Watch me. I'm going to get straight through this game.
This whole next part.
Okay, give me one second.
Okay.
Right, we're on a rescue mission. This is where we last left off.
On rescue mission.
Look at all these zerk eggs. They will eat us. I can't do this.
I'm not as fast as you. The zerk will get me for sure.
Here, take this badge. My papa will recognise it. He will know that you're a friend.
You don't know I don't. Open the door for you.
Think shameless.
This place is really nice, even though it's the slums. I don't know why. I really like it.
Imagine if when this place was cleaned up, like super cleaned up and full of light.
The only reason why it's falling apart is because people haven't been taken care of it, because they've been gone for hundreds of years.
Imagine when this place was all cleaned up. It looked super nice.
I don't like the music. It's making me nervous.
Look at how huge this wall is.
I remember it. It was a symbol of the division between those and the slums in the midtown.
The fact that they kept throwing their garbage down here won't man.
What a horrible thing to do. Maybe that's why they failed.
Dead end. I'm so nervous. I'm so nervous.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
I can't jump. No!
I couldn't jump. It wouldn't let me jump. It didn't give me the option.
That's so dumb.
No, no, no, no, no!

I can go that way. What's up here?
There's two ways to go up here and then I can't come back down or over here.
Well, a memory.
The scientist I used to work for always said he wanted to retire to a little cottage fishing all day long.
Of course, that was not a possibility in the city and nobody could have done that for at least hundreds of years.
Let me get to the outside. We found ourselves a little cottage, the harmless fishing rod and a lot of books.
I think that's what the scientist would have wanted. But first, we should go find out.
I could not be here.
Let's go find out.
This is very relaxing. This comes my heart. I like this very much.
Guys, how is the game audio so far by the way?
It's fine. Audio is fine. Sounds good to me.
That was a good little song. Time to go back on to our adventure. Nice relaxation time.
Big stretch.
You mean car? Clearly I'm a car. What do you mean?
Obviously a car.
I want to make sure everyone can still hear the game.
What are we doing here? I'm assuming I have to go over there. Do I just jump over? Is there anything I have to do with this stuff here?
I don't have anything. It's an electric generator. It seems to require some other part of function.
It's all gloo-y out here.
That was where I was just going to come either way. A window.
Egg vincar.
Why are the zircs so dirty?
And two zircs. They mutated after the humans disappeared.
So now they eat everything and anything. Even metal.
Wait, you're in a house there. Who are you?
That's my badge. You're wearing. How did you find it? Did my son send you? Oh, shameless. You clever boy.
I've been here alone for ages. I came here to test the flux or what it didn't go as planned.
I wish I could go back home. I miss my son dearly.
You can have a lot around the house if you want, but I have no idea how to escape this place.
Who is this?
I've seen humans wear costumes like this.
They were small and running around, making lots of noise. Children.
Oh yes, I remember now. Yeah, they were children. The streets felt much more alive with them.
Is their voice always like this? Yeah. I hope it doesn't bother you. I'm sorry.
You want the difficulty they brought. You don't seem to love them very much.
Is that the same thing? Seems like it.
Wow.
I'll stop. Oh, I cute.
That's a bear.
Sometimes she goes Bremlin and it's adorable. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm pretty old man.
Hey, be careful with that defluxer. A full charge it can explode zirks like conferee.
This baby needs 1.21 gigawatts to work. And the only thing around here with that kind of juice is the generator outside the house.
The problem is that it won't start. I think a fuse blew.
And with all the zirks around it's too dangerous for me to go out and fix it.
I'm not fast enough, but you just might be. If you can reach the generator and replace the fuse, I should be able to get the defluxer recharged.
Come on, follow me. I'll show you what they do.
Is there anything else here?
I just like jumping on things and destroying stuff. It's fun.
I like the sliding doors.
Here, it's like this fuse. It's brand new.
Turning on the generator will be loud so expect some zirks.
Once you fix the generator, I should be able to charge the end kickstart, the defluxer.
You just need to follow this cable, change the fuse, then meet me back here.
Cars have the biggest claws, did you know?
May I sleep to your voice? Yeah, you can. Of course you can. That's perfectly fine.
Is that it? Are you done? Is that over?
Did I come back?
I think that's it.
Oh my God! Ah no!
I didn't even see it though.
Excited robot noises. Super excited robot noises.
Amazing you got the generator back on. Yes!
Have you seen how powerful the defluxer is? It's definitely our way out of here.
Firstly, listening to your stream yesterday, already getting sleepy again. It's inevitable.
Just accept your fate and fall asleep fall.
Wait a minute, I might be able to mount this defluxer to your drone.
It worked. The defluxer is now installed on your fancy drone here.
It's not meant to run off such a small power source. If you use it too much, it cannot function.
Just remember, it's dangerous. Now let's go back to the village.
I'm coming home son. I'm coming home my baby. I'm coming home.
How do you turn it on?
I need to help Doc get back to the slums. I have to defluxer now.
Oh, it's because I'm messing around. I'm sorry.
Oh.
Yeah, I'm aware. Take out all the zerk so we can get through.
Oh. Wow, it's working great, but I was expecting it can overheat.
Let it cool for a bit when that happens. I hope it will last until we reach the village.
That's how you use it.
That switch doesn't work. It looks like the electricity has been cut.
There must be a way to open the door.
Like this?
Wait, I think I know.
Like this? I'm smart. I'm so smart.
I'm intelligent.
Oh, hello.
I like having a way to protect myself. I feel so much safer when I can kill things.
Murdering things is fun. It's fine. In a game, of course. In a game.
Oh. Run!
That was close. Let's go back home.
I'm on the door. He was dying.
This looks so, like, interesting to live, you know? Like everywhere you go, there's probably, like, these are probably like storefronts or something. Homes. You'd pass by.
I don't know why. I know inner city is definitely not good to live in, but it looks so fun.
We're home.
Hello.
I found the sun. I heard.
I go already am.
Thanks for saving Doc, little friend. It's great to see the shame. This is no longer alone.
Now we know that we can fight back against the Zergs. Mama has been waiting for you by the Zergs.
Doc and Shamans look happy. I think we did a good thing together.
Hey, Daddy. What's up, Rosie? Billy? You know my son, Shamans? It's thanks to him that I came back from that damn place.
Yeah, sure. I thought happy is back. Aw. That's so sweet.
Aw. No go. Did I do everything here? I think I did everything here. I have nothing else on my inventory.
We ran out 51% through the game.
It's time to move on. Hi. Mama was waiting for you on his boat. You can join him, but have you done everything you wanted here? I think so.
I'll close the door behind you. Don't want any Zergs coming through. I think so, right? Was there anything else we needed to do?
Hi there. Hi.
The Fluxer is actually is really just a giant LED light. It's true. You will.
Yeah, we're leaving. Well, we're going to go a little deeper, I think. We're going to go into the sewers next.
I love this place. So nice.

I king!
Was there even anyone in here? I remember scratching on the door. Surgery?
Is that a robot doctor?
I think we leave now. I don't think we have anything else to do here.
I think we can go.
Y, y, y.
Y, y, y.

I can't believe you fell back and got the defluxer with this now we can go find both
Let's go. Let's go. Welcome everyone and anyone who's now joining in. It's good to have you.
I hope that you'll have me.
This is hilarious.
Are they a doctor or a mechanic?
Since the majority of them don't even know how to fix other machinery,
I'd say they are robot doctor.
Oh, I can zoom in.
This place is creepy.
I don't see any way to open this gate. Can you take a look on the other side?
Of course.
I don't like what I'm seeing over there.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Disgusting. I sneezed. Did I sneeze? I didn't even notice, but I actually sneezed.
It's all icky, sticky, squelchy. Thank you.
Thank you.
I've never been this far out of the slums with you here. I'm not even scared.
Are you guys not scared with me here?
Are you guys not scared?
They're watching us.
Look at it. It's watching us.
Are you guys not scared?
Are you guys not scared?
I'm not scared at all.
I'm not scared at all.
Are you guys not scared?
All this old machinery is broken now. I think we can only open it manually.
Are you guys not scared?
Are you guys scared?
Quick. Jump below the door. It won't hold for long.
I got it. I'm going.
I can't go with you, but I won't stop looking for a way.
We better not. I don't want to leave Momo.
We're leaving you?
He wouldn't have made it in here anyways.
Oh my gosh.
Oh no, there's a robot.
Oh.
Oh no.
I'm not taking chances. I'm still scared.
Oh my gosh.
I mean I can't go that way. What's over here? There's something over here?
A memory.
The sewer system. Yes, I remember now. Clean water was scarce.
The city was supplied by a huge machinery that dug deep into the earth.
It was like everything else. It was rationed out to sustain people.
Oh my gosh. My brain is lagging.
Just like everything else, it was rationed out to sustain people during times of drought.
Oh boy.
Dyslexia is hitting me really hard right now.
Give me one second.
I can read.
The scientists showed me the blueprint of the water tanks.
They are huge and contain a whole building in them.
Is there anything else? No.
Oh.
Okay.
Is there any other memories? I don't want to miss a memory. No. Here.
It's so dangerous.
Can you cast a break out? I would be traumatized after dealing with pipes.
Oh boy.
So so. Thank you mom and mister Vondella to be.
If you're looking for praise. You've all been very, very good for me.
Good baby crabs. My sweet little things.
Can I just go this way? Can I just avoid them?
Oh oh oh shit.
I have to clear them out one by one.
Okay.
Okay.
Are you fine?
Get off me.
Get off me.
Oh no.
What is this place? This looks extremely creepy.
Am I missing something? Am I missing something?
I'm so scared. I'm procrastinating because I don't want to go home.
Can you avoid some of those? There's a lot of eggs. I can avoid some of the eggs. Probably not all of them because loud noises activate them.
So if I would have left a majority of those eggs out and then hit that lever, all of them probably would have been activated along with the ones coming out of the door.
And they also activate when you get really close to them.
What the fuck?
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Oh shit!
Can I just run? Oh there's too many. This is so dangerous.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Can I just go?
Oh my god. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
OK. You're OK.
All of those terrifying.
Hold on.
Are they closed?
Uh-oh.
Oh.
Oh no. Oh no. I walk them up, I walk them up, I walk them up. I walk them up, I walk them up, I walk them up.

But you saved me. Thank you, friend.
During that month, power was rough on my core.
But the fluxer is completely destroyed now. I have to be careful.
No.
The fluxer was what made me brave without it. I am nothing.
Was there anything else?
So much water. So much wet.
I made it.
I'm here. Did I miss a memory?
I think I missed a memory.

Wow, hello. It's me. Mario.
Okay.
My only weapon is gone, you know? This machine, the scientist, has introduced one of the others.
He was sick. This was his last hope. He walked into the machine.
But I wasn't with him. He was alone. What was he doing?
Isn't that the machine that was in the room when we first got B12?
He uploaded himself into the computer and everything was different.
But the upload something went wrong. He was stuck for hundreds of years until a little cat appeared.
Was it? It was me. I was the scientist. I was human.
I need a moment.
Oh no. Oh no.
I'm sorry. I need a moment. I don't feel like talking right now.
Oh, that's understandable. Go ahead. We just look around. Something scratch.
I get an achievement for that.
I'm a tree.
I'm a tree.
I'm a tree.
I'm a tree.
What else have I forgotten?
Unless I've had parents, friends. What happened to everyone?
I wanted to open the city, but is there even anyone left to say?
It's over here.
That's where I came from.
Up up below.
I blushed. Wait, I sneezed again? When did I sneeze? What? I don't... How come I never remember?
I don't remember sneezing. What is this?
I really sneezed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I gotta need a scratchy.
I'm hungry.
I'm hungry. Why? I'm hungry. Why? Why?
I'm hungry.
Toast time. I want toast. I gotta go get bread though.
I'll get it after.
I'll get an orange. I don't have an orange.
What is this?
I'll get an orange.
My balls are hard.
Hey, don't you know not to interrupt a fellow during his transcendental meditation?
Oh, it's you. You were with Momo when we received a call earlier. I'm glad to meet you at last little outsider.
You know Momo and Doc, so you're already familiar with those outsiders. I miss them, and memory brings me peace.
Momo slyt, Momo staed yn y slums. I heard you helped find Doc in Clementine. She's in Midtown now.
If you still want to see the outside, she's the one who can get you there. Apparently she had some kind of plan to leave the city.
Here, take this. This is meaning you can never leave or her address in the back of this picture. Clementine's picture.
Come in a new item. To reach in Midtown, climb up our little village. It should be easy for a Dick Styrious, one like you.
If you manage to reach the outside, you will be the very first. I would wish you good luck, but you don't need it. I believe in you.
He believes in me. Yeah.
If you had to pick one Pokemon as your partner, what would it be? Either Weed Cat or Lovatar. I really like Lovatar. I have a Lovatar stuffy.
Lovatar.
Weed Cat or Lovatar. Lovatar.
Or any of the Eevee evolutions.
Especially the grass evolution of Eevee. It's my favorite evolution. It doesn't get much love, but I love it.
Leafeon. Yeah, Leafeon.
Sorry, sorry.
Did you know that Vaporeon is... Don't start with that here, alright? Don't start with that.
Don't start. I'm giving my eye on you.
Good night Azura. I hope you have fun. Good night to you too. Have a good night.
Mum.
I love Peter. I can't stop hearing him. Oh my gosh.
No.
Hang on. Give me a second.
I'm not falling asleep, I swear.
I'm not falling asleep. I'm looking at pizza.
I'm not falling asleep.
Let me stretch.
The eapiness is starting to hit me.
I'm getting pizza.
Yeah, we ordered a pizza.
Guys, I'm already done, so please get yourself a snack, water or something to drink. Get a blankie and get comfy.
Mine will probably take time to get here, but I'm going to get it.
I really shouldn't, but I've been craving a pizza for like two weeks.
I've been craving pizza since before they built when we were chatting about pizza in the chat. I still haven't forgotten.
I haven't had pizza since then. Even before that. I haven't had pizza in a long time.
Pizza is very expensive over here. It's very expensive.
It's fine. You don't worry about it. It's fine.
Let me put this in the way you keep playing.
It's fine.
No, it's a bad drink.
It's fine.
No break.
Let me grab this.
Oh my God, I am a river. You don't have to do that. Thank you. Thank you for the 30. Thank you.
You're insane. Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, how cute. My legs are, I feel like jelly. It was sitting for so long.
Okay.
Is it an honor? Is it an honor for you?
First week young ladies will, that's so sweet of you. Oh my God. That's so very sweet of you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Let's continue with the game while we wait for foods to come.
Let me take another small break.
Where is the cave? Sorry for shutting down earlier.
I'm human, probably the last in the world. Now it was left to me.
So much has come back to me. How much have I forgotten?
Maybe if we find something, we can restore my memories and get you back home at the same time.
So we can go back down and find out more, the companions are head onward to Mattel.
You should go find Clementine. Oh, nothing has happened to her.
Clementine at the top of our village and find a path to reach Mattel.
But before we do that, we're going to have a look around.
Oh, I want to go down. I want to go down. I want to look around for us.
Now we can talk to people, I think.
This food is actually horrible, but it's the only thing around.
I'll have to unscrew my front casing if I keep eating this trash.
Maybe I should open my own place because I really can't get any worse than that.
A GPU done, all you can eat buffet. Imagine that. I can eat that stuff forever.
People call me the Teng Chef. I specialize in upcycling leftovers.
Raman. Raman C45. That's my secret ingredient.
Who told you about the secret ingredient?
It's a kitchen.
Can I go down there? I can.
Mine. Thanks.
Flower.
Where's the stove?
It's a cute little area to lay down.
It's another one of those spots.
Raman. Raman GPU done.
I've only ever had udon once, but I didn't have all the other stuff in it. It was just the noodles.
I've only had udon noodles. I haven't had the other stuff they put in it.
I can't eat pre-packaged ramen noodles because it messes with my stomach for some reason.
My stomach can't digest the packaged ramen, so I end up like it comes back up after like 10 minutes.
I can not even very long. It hurts. It makes my tummy hurt a lot.
So I can only eat actual freshly cooked ramen.
I used to eat at a certain place.
They make the best ramen. It tastes so good.
It's the only place that I can actually stomach eating it.
Other than that, I can't stomach anything else.
Raman. Raman.
We don't have many Raman places that are made traditionally.
There are people who are learning how to make it, but they are making it.
It doesn't taste good.
It doesn't taste very good. It doesn't taste like traditional ramen at all.
That's why there's only so many places that I will go to to make ramen really good, in my opinion.
Raman. Raman.
Yeah. It isn't many places.
I have a car too.
One thing I don't like about my city is that there are no dedicated ramen places.
What are they about to see in the world though?
Or soba. I like yaki soba.
But I think that's the only packaged one that I can eat.
I can eat packaged yaki soba.
I think it's made very differently.
I can eat that and it tastes so good.
I wish I had the one I could tell you.
Zori reviews.
I got a few very few ramen places around here, but they're just okay, sadly.
This is a way of life.
I have a few sushi places. We have everything.
I wish we had more.
More Asian cuisine.
Oh hello there. It has been so long since we've had a visitor.
We'll accept those dimsirks of course.
Imagine if we could harness their power.
Have them run in a wheel or something.
Just to waste the potential.
When I grow up, I want to be great like Aunt Clementine.
I look so new.
I look like such a new robot.
I wanted to explore like she did, but the grown-ups verbatised the antithlet.
Is there anything else around here?
Zia's electric zerk everywhere.
Why don't you wake up?
We have a lot of robots that are pretty rusty.
All the old robots are kind of rusty.
They have a little bit of rust on them.
In this language, a companion robot made it up from scratch. How impressive.
I remember it happening when I was in the network.
I don't know when exactly, but at one time all the communications started to switch to the symbols.
I was stuck in a computer and alone for a long time.
So I translated every symbol in word one by one until I was able to understand everything.
Now that I'm out, I know their language. I'm curious to hear all they have to say.
I hate that gap. I can't believe I missed a memory.
Does this wake them up?
The painter.
Mae. Do you know there are more than 900 sads of white pant?
I don't tell anyone, but I'm creating my own shade of pant.
I'm calling it garbage brown.
Ew. White garbage brown.
Hang on, this is a door. I'll be right back.

I just want like a purple-ish pink and I like this color of that.
One of my favorite colors.
I was a bellbut many cycles ago but I repurposed myself into a treasure hunter.
Don't be fooled by the sound of it. It can be hard and gruesome just like this arm I just found.
Oh, I mean they lost an arm. Oh, they did. They found a new arm.
For a fellow may he rest in peace.
Isn't it like lavender? Yeah, it's called periwinkle.
It's a color that tricks you. It's my favorite color that tricks you in the spectrum because it looks like it's purple, but it's actually blue.
It's my favorite color.
I love the color.
Is that what I call a junk? I call it treasure.
Yeah, it's one of my favorite, favorite colors. I like baby colors like baby blue,
yellow, but really, really light yellow, orange, but super light. I like the little baby color spectrum.
It's my favorite.
It's gay, can I? Do I just go back the same way?
This way.
Indeed. Sorry for leaving early again. Oh, that's okay. Don't worry about it.
I'll see you in the next round.
I'm getting very epic. Good night, Russ. Good night.
I mean.
What's going on there on the top bunk? It's pant.

Hello, I'll call her. Thanks buddy.
You got any other one for me please? Please?
Oh wow, you're so pretty. Thank you.
Can you find me another one for me? Please? Please?
Hi, hello. Welcome then. Hi.
How are you?
Oh, I heard it's a rare plant. Thank you.
Bona mam. Thank you so much here as a reward to my badge.
It looks so good. It looks so good with it. It looks, it looks, it looks.
Not you, but it as in like the thingy that's on my back. It looks so good with it.
All right. I'll take care now. I'll see you friend.
I'm bored. I'm claiming that I used the whole classes here so you learn a lot of cool stuff.
It's like a little classroom. That's so cute.
Oh. Wait, am I supposed to jump on that?
No? Oh. It just took me all the way back. No.
I'll go back up.
Only up, only up. Wait, can I knock these over? Oh.
I want to knock those over. Do you want to jump over there? I can't.
Is it? It's a second.
You guys see uncle and son? Can you tell me that everyone's a sister? Sure. You can do that.
Up to daisy, up to daisy.
I feel like I'm forgetting something. Is there memory that I forgot about? No, I think there's only one.
I go up here.
It looks like the sun up there, but you know it's not. Fake white lights.
Is it normal for a cat to be obsessed with socks?
I suppose so.
I know my cat used to be obsessed with my shoes.
He'd lay on my shoes all the time.
I'm sorry for a fourth size of pizza. I'm having a fourth slice. This kills me.
I'm going to drink.
You like seafood?
You like seafood?
You do? You do like seafood?
You do? You do like seafood?
No, I spilled it everywhere. No, my blanket.
No, I got to suck it out of the blanket.
No, it's all wet.
I'm back. You're all no fun.
I like the little detail of the tail sticking up.
The tail sticking up literally for a cat is a greeting, by the way.
When a cat's tail sticks up, it's literally saying hello.
So every time robot comes out, the tail sticks up. I think that's so cute. Such a cute detail.
No manners.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I completely forgotten this kind of transportation existence.
You can ride anywhere in the city. People used to take it to go to work.
I used to take it too. Every morning after saying goodbye to my family at home.
I remember I was doing this for them. They were gone now. It was a long ago.
You wanted to see the outside, but does that even matter anymore?
What happened to them? What happened to everyone?
Anyway, we're near Mitano. Let's find this Clementine.
We can have a picture of her. We have a picture of her.
We can show it so some of the companions are on here. Maybe they'll point us in the right direction.
Make your memory.
That's a transdation.
That's a transdation.
I don't know what to say.
I don't know what to say.
Translay it.
Clothes due to pandemic restrictions, please do not enter.
Any violations of rules can result heavy prison sentence.
Were the people in the lower section sick?
Were they sick?
I remember.
There's so many books here.
Deterian, test legacy, the ethics of artificial intelligence.
I recognise some of these books. I have a library.
I remember nothing was quiet like the smell of books in the turn of payage.
It was a feeling almost like comfort.
A book was like spending time with someone.
Miao. Miao. Miao. Miao. Miao. Miao.

I don't know what to say.

Clementine, trouble maker, outsider, rebellious, please report any sightings.
Yeah.
I told you five times.
You can't run around like that.
It's dangerous.
Hey, this is the first time I've seen this kind of robot.
He looks so fluffy.
Oh, it's the girl displayed on this one screen, right?
You should ask somebody else.
I'm just busy with yours here to know anything.
No, I already read that.
Oh, can I talk to the little guy?
Little guy?
No.
Don't worry about trash.
Nicocorporatio takes care of everything.
They didn't take care of anything.
Ruh.
Oh.
Is there another?
I arrest them.
What's this?
Access to lower level is restricted due to organic life hazards.
Please keep out of this area.
I closed the elevator.
This is the elevator that leads down below, isn't it?
Well, yeah, look.
I'm right below inside the elevator.
It's dumb.
It's the town.
They're down there.
Hee.
Do you hear that down below?
That ebb, that flow?
Is that he haunts me?
It haunts me?
I don't hear that.
I don't hear that.
I don't hear that.
I don't hear that.
City haunts me?
It haunts me?
Probably.
Caz buzzed for an only sad.
Why is he sad?
Won't he sad?
Pan a team up for that.
That trash, that trash city blast is no joke.
EverydayNekoCorp is doing this relentless work on me.
Oh, Clementine?
Yeah, I used to hang out with her.
She wanted to live.
She was a breeze and then she flew.
She's a wanted person now.
I'm too heavy for me.
Hear that?
That ebb, that flow?
I don't hear that.
How did I get over here?
Oh, what's over there?
Did I hear that?
It's the transmitter tower over there.
That's where I turned on the power.

Excuse me?
Drilling nothing over here?
There's something supposed to be over here?
I'm a little confused.
There's a bunch of boxes to jump on.
Please state your identity as a peacemaker.
Co-operate, or we will have to transfer you to jail and reboot you.
Please leave me alone. I'm not the one you're looking for.
If you're looking for Clement Simon, I'm sure she's hiding in the residence.
Midtown, this looks so cool.
This is what I mean.
This is what I mean by living in a place like this.
Looks really cool.
Doesn't it?
This looks so cool.
I.
Consider this tomorrow if I replace my arm with another robotic arm.
Then the next day my other arm too.
Then my body and so on until I replace all my parts and upgrade my software.
Will I be the same robot you're talking to now?
If you maintain the same memory as I think so.
Oh hey, what are you showing me right now?
A bunch of people I don't know.
My guess is that they probably live in the massive housing building further uptown.
Do what you want with that.
Thanks, Mr. Bloody.
Destruction.
Destruction, no.
Something else in here.
Meow.
Wonton ni ar?
Hey, I'm off to work. See you later.
Okay honey, be cautious of sentinels.
They're quite, they're quick to make a rest for no reason, for no good reason.
Don't worry about me, babe, I'm good.
Hello.
Gray.
At Nygle Corp, we work all day long together the ways and send it downstairs,
where they recycle and repurpose it.
Speaking of downstairs, it has been a while since we had news from them.
We'll picture that one.
Hey, is that an address on the back?
First symbol is the street, and then there is a floor and a door number.
It's gonna be easy to find.
Ready?
How do you...
Uh, examine.
Oh.
Oh.
They said a...
Come on, I can do this.
Ha ha.
A street, a street door number, and then what?
What was it?
Whatever that symbol is, three five?
Floor.
Flo.
Sorry, little one, you can't play over here.
The Nygle Corp factory is no place for a little fussball idea.
Access is restricted, but only for a little while.
If you can wait a few years, we'll open right back up.
Wait, I didn't show in the picture.
Cool picture, is that address on the back?
Oh, you're just gonna tell me the same thing.
Ha ha.

Hi. Clubs closed. Get lost? Oh yeah? Who are you? Police? Everyone's looking for her.
I'll let her in if that's what you want to know.
Ooh, what's down there?
This merchant crook sold me a faulty battery the other day.
Now he just prisions not to hear me. Every time I try to confront him.
If he wasn't for the Sentinel on patrol he'd end up a spare part.
I don't think he has any. I think he needs to be charged.
Translate.
Code is a 2458 or 8542. 2458 or 8542. Looks like it's backwards.
Tiaw, remember that? You guys are smart.
Oh wait, it's this. What was it? What was it again?
Again?
458? Oh.
That didn't work. 22548. 22548. Nope, that didn't work.
8458. Oh, wait. Not in the dictionary.
8452? Oh. 8452. Ha!
I can't do no bad. I can't have a cat bad.
I am cool.
What? I'm a little hippie.
I'm a little hippie.
Can I go any further up or anything like that?
Surgery and then a bunch of robot parts.
You've been in the city below? I had a friend there.
Fifi. I haven't seen him in ages. Did we see someone named Fifi?
Down in the city below?
I don't remember seeing anyone named Fifi.
I don't remember. I don't remember. Me too.
I don't know what the downstairs neighbors are up to.
I keep hearing bazaar and hammer noises.
Is the doctor?
I don't know.
I didn't say I could jump on their head.
Oh no. I thought that was an option too.
That'd be funny.
Translate.
Announcement.
If you're looking for some company to talk about poetry, I live behind the elevator.
Bonobot.
I went and talked to them.
I used to own a bar. It was the coziest place around here until I took a screwdriver in the knee and it's closed now.
Even if this guy bums me out, he's my only customer. Try not to scare him away.
Big city.
Sorry shops closed. I'm waiting for the delivery guys.
It seems they're taking their sweet time.
What's this picture? Oh I know her. She was one of those people who all obsessed with the outside.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Oh.
I'm feeling really epi.
It's this triniest shop in the meantime where the shopkeeper is pretty grumpy.
What a nice looking picture. Is that an address in the back?
Yeah I know what the address is.
I thought there was a door here.
Are you one of those young punks listening to loud music all day? No.
Don't touch anything. Don't make any noise. Don't ask for your credit.
Whatever. I was going to ask you for anything anyways.
Whatever.
It's over here.
I don't have anything to put in there.
What was this?
Where am I?
It wouldn't let me the option to knock it down then pop up.
It's another shop.
What's this?
Translate.
Is it hell with the symptoms along with the outsiders?
Chat.
Chat.
I'm tired.
I'm really tired.
I'm really tired.
I'm so tired.
I thought I could finish this.
I could finish this in one sitting.
But I did not get any sleep.
But you could soon.
I really need to go to sleep.
I gotta go to bed.
I have part three. Let's go.
Don't ever believe in me again.
I can do it.
I can do it.
Work hard again later.
It's so hard. I cannot keep my eyes open.
If I had gotten some really good sleep, baby, I could have gone on a little longer.
But I haven't.
I didn't sleep very good last night.
The lady is getting a sleep.
I have so much on my mind that was bothering me.
How do you save the game?
Is there a way to save?
I don't know if it gets to a checkpoint or something.
Where's the next checkpoint?
I can save the game.
I can save the game.
I can save the game.
Is there really nothing over there?
Is it here?
Or is it here?
What's this?
It's a jail.
I can't believe that.
If they threw them in jail, then their battery ran out.
It's so horrible.
Did the game save when I picked up the badge?
I didn't look.
I didn't check.
How do you check?
49 seconds.
We're fine.
We'll play the rest in the next one.
I'm so tired.
I'm so sorry, everyone.
I'm so exhausted.
I just really needed some sleep.
It's time for bed.
It's a fun game, though.
I really like it a lot.
It's super fun.

I went through Helen back to fix my settings to make sure that my sound sounded okay and then
my volume was okay. It could be hard, it wasn't too loud, it was too quiet. I finally fixed my audio
and I think it's fine. Finally okay now. No strange noises, no buzzing, no nothing like that
because none of that should be in it. None of that should be in it. Am I hearing background noises
every now and then, but excuse me, that's okay. My god, it's good, it's been great honestly,
it's good, yay. I'm happy, almost happy. Oh my goodness. And, and, and guess what, guess what, guess
what? Oh my god, guess what? It's going on, never sorry, please don't forget to take your meds. Oh,
I have completely forgot about that. Why? Yeah, I'll take my meds, I'll take on the meds right now,
right now, right now.
I don't think everything's on your stream, but it's good for the time I was here. I'm glad, I'm good.
Yes, guess what? Also, also, also, I haven't crashed, I haven't crashed or my internet hasn't
went out. This whole stream, is that amazing? I didn't crash, I didn't go out.
Yay, we had a really good, really good stream.
I love W. Yeah, we had an extreme score. I only think I wish me being very happy. Very happy.
I promise I'll sleep. I'll be, I'll be up for a little bit and then I'm gonna just go sleep.
I'm so tired. I was up all night because I was so sad. I was so sad last night.
I must have, I should have been way more careful.
And then I would have probably got monetized much earlier. But I was, I was being naughty.
I guess you could say. I was being the stinker. I was the stinker.
I was so sad and I was just constantly thinking about it last night.
I ended up doing all my, I had an audio setting last night. I was just doing audio.
As you know, audio found out why my volume was so messed up.
Hawaii sounded so different. I finally figured it out.
Set it up and it removed stuff. All my settings I had previously was okay.
I couldn't figure out why everything else was messed up.
Come to find out that it was just my window settings.
My window volume went down for some reason and I fixed that up. That's all fixed up.
And it was causing, like everything else was causing ducking and stuff. So
if the other girls need help with their audio constantly ducking or peaking,
I can help with it since I worked on it all night.
It wasn't volume mixer.
Cut out with the bleeding hires. Yeah, we could all cut out.
No one expects you to marathon streams every day.
I like streaming for a long time though. It keeps me very distracted.
The world is a terrible place. Streaming is very fun. Very fun, very distracting.
And I like being that distraction for other people as well,
where you could just come in, relax, get cozy, focus on your voice, and then get some tears.
I might do sleepy time stories for videos for you guys instead of live streams.
Like just video videos of ASMR slayup.
Aw, thank you. That's so sweet. Thank you so much for the $5 tip they had all for fun.
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.
Mm-mm.
Okay, are you with those two?
Here, my best distraction. I'm glad. I'm glad I can be that space for you guys.
I want to be that safe space. I might not be the extreme
lwyd, like the other girls, because I know they can be a little
intense. I can always be that nice, relaxing, comfy zone that you can retreat to.
If the intensity is too much for you, you can always come to me and mama will take care of you.
Mm-hmm. That's taking. No, I won't take it right now.
Wow.
That's good. I really need to pick up my pain meds, though. My shoulder has been killing me.
Oh, thank you.
You're just so sweet. Oh, my gosh. You're so sweet. Thank you, Peony,
because I still don't know how to pronounce your name correctly. Peony. Peony.
Thank you for the $4 tip, Peony. I'm so glad you enjoy my strength.
And yes, Black Wolf. Black Wolf, thank you so much for the $4 tip.
Every time because I was with Mommy. I'm glad you enjoy it.
I'm so sorry, Peony.
I have taken my meds if anyone is asking. I'm wondering they have been taken.
And when you get your soft voice going, my back just shimmers. That's it.
Oh, am I glasses? Yeah. I need to pick those up, too.
That's true. I'll call them tomorrow. I promise. Just remind me. I'll do it. I'll call them tomorrow.
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow.
I love being here so much just because it's so calm and relaxing. Letters can be too much
at times. That's why I like it here. I'm glad I've been kind of beating myself up to be like the other girls.
Like, I don't know. I just don't have it in me to be that way when I'm live, you know?
I'm a little embarrassed and I get really red with face burns.
But being like this is very easy for me. It's natural. It's just who I am. I just be myself when I stream live.
It'd be me and then I like it comfy and being as sweet to you guys. But you're so sweet to me.
Well, I don't know. As to purposely trying to be loose with them as it's my thing.
Especially while live. But doing like recordings and stuff is easy. I can record. I can do that.
I don't have too many eyes on me watching me.
What?
You're doing great. Nothing of yourself about it. So that makes you feel comfy. You know, I enjoy the comfy.
Yeah, it's just I've already gotten a few morals wishing that I was more fluid by so many morals.
I haven't really sorry. I haven't I've been reading everyone's morals. So many people sent me some really nice things, but
I haven't been able to respond to a majority of morals lately because I think I've flooded with quite a few of things that got me a little
sad. So I've been avoiding the morals for the time being.
But it's perfectly fine. They're not bad. They're not extremely bad. It's just me being the little overthinker that I am.
That's all. Nothing extremely bad.
Just a lot of morals. Every time I go through like 50 morals, there's like 100 more.
I go through like 25 morals and there's another 100 more. I can't. It's so many.
And then I have to skip some and I feel bad skipping morals. It's so many morals.
It's so many.

Mi'n ddana yn bwysig mae hwnna o'r tîngr o gyfo.

I'm glad. I like the way you guys react whenever I hit you with something.
The way you guys fall. Have hiccups. The way you guys fall and crumple.
Ravel in my feet.
I'm glad.
Yeah.
As long as I'm after a carrot, I am pretty much.
You love gremlin also.
Mmm. That's fine.
There's like many great emails at work. There's so many of them. Yeah. They're hard.
You guys, there's one. There's a small amount. I will try. I'll do my absolute best.
I just feel so bad because I answered so many morals, but I never used marshmallow before.
So I didn't know how to make them public, nor like or
send morals before, but now I know and I can try.
I'll try again.
I'll try again.
Mmm. I'll read them out to my own pairs.
Your voice is loud enough for me. It's just my normal voice.
What a man.
Melt from her words.
Melt. Melt away. Melt for me.
Mwami. Mwai a crumbel anasura saeth anethang.
Come on, melt away.
You might need a higher person. Just sort your morals.
Possibly.
But I like going through them. I just feel, I just have this urge not to miss out on anything.
And I don't know. Maybe I'll have to think on it.
But I'm sure that we are kind of already like, I can like
get that figured out regardless.
So it'll be fine.
I'm sure I can take up any kind of offers
that they can help me out with.
Manzan and Shrani has done an amazing job thus far with helping me out.
I'm a very clumsy person and I think I have like the worst luck in the world.
The worst absolutely fucked world luck in the world.
And it's been like that for years ever since I was young.
I've gotten hurt.
Restrained as accidents have been around me.
I cause big things to happen on accident.
This has been like a thing that has been running on with me for like a long, long, long time.
So yeah.
All I can do is power through it because I'm used to it.
But I feel so bad when other people get involved and then messes with them.
As well.
If it's just me, it's fine.
Yeah, I'll be sad about it, but it is what it is.
I know I defy as a puddle.
I'll be doing okay.
Don't do things that make you uncomfortable.
Be comfy and we'll be comfy.
I'm comfy.
I'm very comfy.
Today was a really nice comfy stream today.
So I really enjoyed the day.
A lot of fun.
I'm just very sleepy and I'll be sleeping very soon.
Once this medication starts kicking in, I'm definitely going to go head to head.
We want to be good boys and girls for you, Mumu.
You are good boys.
And you are good girls.
I'm very proud of you for being here and supporting your Mumu.
You're all very brave and very good.
Take it at your own pace, Mumu.
I will.
Are you today or more yet?
Just a bit.
Well, I'm lucky to find you.
That's so sweet.
Thank you.
I'll be here to support you 100% of the way.
Thank you.
I can only wish and hope that is the case.
I can only hope.
I'd rather be kind than mean to gain good luck.
If it just means that it's just me getting at fault, then that's fine.
But I just don't like when other people get affected.
Thank you so much for the $4 tip the iron reaper.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I love your goddess.
That's why.
Thank you.
Maximum comfort.
Will you can get a great sleep tonight?
I'm very sure I will.
I am going to just sleep tonight.
You guys got me this fan.
I have a toaster.
I've been eating toast.
I've been actually eating some food.
Though I caved and got pizza,
but I have so much more pizza left over and this can last me for a few days.
I'll make sure to stretch it out.
Even though I ate like four slices and three cheese sticks.
That's fine.
I guess stretch the rest out for the rest of the days.
Can we get a good night kiss before you go?
Yeah, sure.
I can do that for you.
But it will have to be a quick one.
There you go.
I'm really looking forward to what you have planned for ASMR videos and stuff like that.
Most of it's just going to be some of the stuff I already talked about.
And I was really, really looking forward to doing the workout ASMRs, but
I hope you enjoyed it.
I'll see you in the next video.
With YouTube being the way it's being right now, I don't think that's a really wise idea.
So we'll have to put that on hold for a while until it seems safe to do so.
For now, I'll stick to doing regular ASMRs.
I'm trying to find some triggers for you guys that I can do,
but I'll probably mostly praising and taking in requests of things you want me to say.
Because I'll do that then.
Request.
And some petting and brushing.
And I have bubble wrap, plastic licking and tapping.
I don't really have much to tap with,
but I can do tapping and stuff like that.
Oh, and heartbeats.
Thank you to heartbeats for you guys.
If you're ever feeling bad just remember we are always here for you in our world.
Thank you.
I'm so happy to have all of you here.
My sweet little bleeding hearts.
My sweet sweet babies.
Thank you all so much for all of your support and my endeavours.
Mmm.
Hopefully you'll get the monetization soon.
Hopefully, but it'll probably take quite some time.
So I hope you're all able to wait for me.
Wait for me please.
Really sorry that I wasn't more prepared.
For the monetization.
I'm really sorry.
I want you to say you're good.
I'll feel as long as you request it.
I can do that.
Heartbeats are one of my favourites.
They help me calm.
I'm glad.
I'll wait.
I'll wait for you as long as it takes.
Wait.
I'm glad.
Thank you.
I love you.
In the meantime.
In the meantime.
Let us see who we can read for tonight.
I believe we can read

Well, I'm really unsleepy.
That means you have to stay right?
No.
No.
On those day I have to go get a cleave.
I'll be streaming tomorrow some supermarket simulator.
And we'll have some more.
