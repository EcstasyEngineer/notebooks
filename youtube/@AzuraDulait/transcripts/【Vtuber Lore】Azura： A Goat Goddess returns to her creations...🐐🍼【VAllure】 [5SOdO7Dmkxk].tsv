0	10840	The earth was juvenile, barren in its infancy, then from dust and darkness, the lifeless
10840	18160	silence was broken, the crust of the earth cracked and moored, and from the bed of creation
18160	21880	within it rose the first family.
21880	27480	Upon seeing the empty earth, they used the immeasurable power within themselves to form
27480	31120	beauty in an empty canvas of the land.
31120	38880	They lit the sky with stars, pulled the mountains from the ground, and filled craters with oceans.
38880	44720	Among the divines, the sister Azira would colour the land's invertency, fill the blue
44720	51680	oceans with life, and instil within these creations the potential to grow and repopulate.
51680	57760	In her accomplishment, she would be known as the Goddess of Fertility.
57760	62880	In time, Azira's creations would grow in intellect and complexity.
62880	68920	From their scattered tribes, the gods took to guiding humanity with their superior knowledge.
68920	75160	In this exchange, humanity gave them worship and devotion, the gods would shape the foundations
75160	81880	of human civilization across the land in each celebrating their divine benefactor.
81880	87880	The gods, confident that mankind could stand on their own, sought to create the heavens,
87880	92680	a place where the gods could raise families of their own kind, as earth was no space for
92680	94180	them to grow.
94180	99480	They rightfully seeked the same prosperity that they offered for their own and left.
99480	105040	Out of all the gods, it was Azira who could not leave humanity.
105040	111860	She loved her creations, yet she also loved the gods.
111860	117720	She left a piece of her divinity with her family in remembrance and remained on earth
117720	125280	to live among humanity, not as a ruler, but as a watcher and caretaker.
125280	131320	It would be after the gods departure that the long peace would end.
131320	136560	With the imbalance of power, wars between the regions could not be prevented.
136560	143640	Anger, strife, and hunger for power would taint the ego of man, and Azira's limited
143640	149640	power could not restore the will the gods had left behind for humanity.
149640	156240	In her perceived failure, Azira would seemingly disappear from the walks of history.
156240	161440	It has been long theorized that the goddess still lives amongst us in secret.
161440	167360	There has been a long time speculation that, throughout history, Azira has been guiding
167360	174560	humanity in small leadership roles, humanitarian efforts in philanthropy, or using her power
174560	178680	to prevent cataclysmic disasters.
178680	185000	However she is, we can all rest easy that she is watching over us from a position befitting
185000	187440	a goddess among men.
187440	193040	Well, Billy, I think we all learned an important lesson here today.
193040	195120	That's right, Papa.
195120	198080	Whatever happens, we're all family.
198080	202880	That's exactly right, Billy, and there's nothing more important than family.
202880	203880	Oh, shucks.
203880	207440	I'm so happy I have such a big happy loving family.
207520	210640	I'd be such a sucker if I didn't have a family.
210640	212640	Aw, Billy.
223640	229640	It has been a few years since I came to the realization that I could no longer outrun
229640	232240	the reach of mankind.
232240	238240	Living among animals, I tried to run from civilization for as long as time would allow.
238240	244840	I am content to play the role of a commoner among humanity, yet I am tortured still by
244840	248240	loneliness, by desires.
248240	250640	I cannot fight my needs anymore.
250640	257400	I must find my place among the humans and start a family.
257400	264440	In my inaugural efforts to integrate into modern society, it became clear that I lack
264440	269440	the necessary knowledge to fraternize as humans do.
269440	277080	With animals, it's so simple, yet with humans, my knowledge avails me no aid.
277080	282840	Again and again, I accumulated countless attempts at courting a suitable mate.
282840	289200	How could I, before my goddess of fertility, struggle in this venture?
289200	293840	Yet seeing the progress humanity has earned themselves, astounds me.
293840	300240	They have become creators in themselves, expanding upon the earth we had given them.
300240	306560	The tiny seed I had planted all those eons ago, well how it blossomed.
306560	312800	I had believed my heart broken beyond repair, but living as they do, I see now, I see now,
313000	317640	that they don't need the wills of higher beings to find their own happiness.
317640	322840	Perhaps this, in itself, was the will of the gods.
322840	331200	I see now the beauty in the human spirit, for all its ugliness and evil, but also in its kindness and community.
331200	336840	It is the dichotomy of these aspects that makes them worthy of my love.
336840	340000	I only regret not growing alongside them.
340000	345160	I must make up for lost time, for every kindling of my passion.
345160	351560	I have found, I have endless love to give, and give it a shell.
351560	353720	Any takers?
