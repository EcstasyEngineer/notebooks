i put energy in reserve
and the reserves and then i pull it out for the girls
how she she be is not wrong i'm i'm kind of a little bit different very high energy a little more
high energy over it more talking and calls and stuff
ow my knee
i just hit the microphone sorry
trying to wrap this around me because i'm a bit nippy
i wish i had a hoodie i don't have a hoodie
but if you guys want a hoodie you can wear mine so buy it on the merch
buy it on the merch
no i don't have a hoodie
i i basically i pretty much wear the same clothes um as uh you know technically
i don't really uh i don't really like clothes and i really mean that like seriously i don't like wearing clothes
i'm super uncomfy
so
check out the merch store in the description and you can see what my merch really does look like
i did have this turned off though
there you go
um
stop stop stop
mama
there we are
there we are
another really mad house
i'm just a small boy
oh no see you're gonna get me copyrighted you can't sing you can't save lyrics in the chat
you're gonna make me sing them i'm a kid can't be right
she'd be worrying us with the info she didn't know that was hilarious
she almost she almost died
i almost died
like that actually threw me off so bad i i i couldn't i can't breathe i can't breathe
my sides was hurting so much i haven't laughed that hard in like a long time it's been so
long since i laughed that hard i was like literally in tears i was crying my eyes are
super dry right now because i was crying so hard
um
wearing oversized shorts that sounds so comfy
um
you know i don't sit in your like leather chairs with like nothing on you don't
like sit niki in your chair and then leave like an imprint
of sticks and balls sticks and um the balls you know you don't leave an imprint
um
i'm not in my leather chair with my sweaty ass
i'm gonna be all up in my chair it's already falling apart like i can barely turn the chair
without the chair make it noise
um
she's a doll she makes me laugh she's really funny
i like uh bouncing off that kind of energy it's fun
since i don't like you know interrupting people so i really don't mind when other people
when other people talky you know
like i really don't mind it so if she she has a lot of energy herself then it turns me a little energetic a little more than normal
uh give me one second i think my sound is messed up me oops no i didn't mean to open that
my apologies let's me open the crack thing there we go nope all my settings are okay
for me um did i mess up something somewhere along the line
i wonder
everything's okay for me is it really low
i know my i didn't turn down my bmg bgm like it's on me because i forgot
if i'm fine
i can turn this up a little more just a tiny bit
tell me if this is okay not too high
okay let me know
i know uh
excellent sorry keep like touching the microphone
ah i'm so sorry or
this is fine don't worry about me and the strolling
um
uh when i do my ASMRs i actually have to switch out my chair
i have to switch out my chair because um you can hear it in the 3dio every time i move like the slightest movement it'll just go
i try really hard but so hard
it's so hard to to move in my chair
yeah it picks up my creaks so i have to sit and i i like to take a chair from out of the kitchen
and i use the kitchen chair it's like a tall chair really tall chair i sit on top of it
um the chair is like the same size like the same height as my like my desk my my kitchen table
kitchen table
so i'm like really high up
the thing in the ASMR thing with the 3dio is really fun i'm the it was like since it was like my first time using the 3dio
as a whole i might really do it using it so i'm like figuring all the kinks out and stuff
i want to figure out oh i'll figure it out okay
yeah there's an ASMR this week yes yes yes sir
oh speaking of table table table speaking of table speaking of table someone did get
me a table um someone actually did get me a table i however i i i just um what happened was
um
what's going on here
someone got me a table someone asked me this in the morrow i think yeah i was anonymous
someone asked me in the morrow uh if i got the table i completely forgot i was gonna talk about it
in the last stream in the beginning but i forgot um i mean at the end um
it was put through a credit like some sort of credit so i gotta buy it myself with it so it's
gonna take me a little bit of time to do that so it's just sitting there waiting for me to do it
so don't worry you didn't get scammed don't worry i have to actually do it myself
so it's just sitting there you gotta wait um which is kind of good giving the fact that my
room is extremely cluttered and i really honestly didn't think anyone would get that table
i thought it was just gonna be there the entire time i appreciate it so much so i
didn't need a table i just didn't think it would be like given to me right now
once i make some space i'll i'll uh i'll get to that and it'll just sit here until i sort
stuff out and then i'm able to move i don't want to unpack it and then put it together immediately
you know what i mean if i'm planning on moving very soon
so sitting sitting in the credit right now and then i'll do it and then i'll get it and then i'll
get the table
and then each entire chazzo someone will really think that'd be the life i wouldn't have to do it myself
now you got an excuse to clean your room technically yeah but am i really gonna clean it
i'm kind of gonna abandon a lot of stuff in here
i'm kind of gonna abandon quite a lot of stuff in here
after i take the things that i want i'm gonna just it's free reign
for my uh
yeah
i i don't know i don't know if uh if i can take a lot of this stuff with me that's the thing
i can't take apart my bed frame because that bed frame was the first
bed frame i ever bought with money that i earned with my hard work
it was the first thing i ever bought besides the computer
because i was tired of sleeping on the floor
i'd be more than willing to put together
yeah yeah yeah first i had like um let's see first i slept on the floor
then i had a like a like a like a you know one of those foldable futon
beds
then i had that
like with the really tiny thin mattress then that broke
then i slept on just the little mattress
and then i got a cat then my cat peed on it and then you can't get rid of cat pee smell
so then i had to throw that away and i slept on the floor again
and then i was lint um i keep saying lint but then i was given a mattress
like an old old used mattress from a family family member
so then i had a yeah
so then that was on like they gave me the not just the mattress but they gave me the bed frame
but it was a really big bed frame like it took up like a lot of the space in my room
so i i i got a new
uh oh did my sister move back in for a little while she moved back in
and then i had to get rid of the bed and then we got a bunk bed
we got a bunk bed and then i put the mattress on the top because i had to sleep on the top
and then i slept on the top and then my sister moved out
and then i got rid of the bunk bed and i bought me a new bed frame
yeah that's that's how it went
yeah i used to share the room with my my sister for a long time
um
wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow
sorry
yeah i broke my bed frame broke like it was like a metal like really like you
know those flimsy little metal like futons one that folds i guess it like folded wrong
no i remember what happened so my mom decided to come into my room when i wasn't there
and i think she like like like you know how when you flop onto a bed but your whole body
you just flop onto it so she flopped onto it and she broke my bed so she broke the metal
part of my bed
she broke it
yeah that's how it broke i couldn't remember how it broke i had it for quite some time
it was like horrible sleeping on it but i was used to it
as she broke my bed
and before that oh way before that i owned a couch i didn't have a bed i didn't have a mattress
or a or a bed i had a couch
and my my auntie was getting rid of her her couch and i took it i took her couch
it was like a futon couch
you ever did that thing where you like laid on it and then you folded yourself inside
or like a family member inside
we used to do that a lot i stopped doing that when i heard of the story of some kids that actually got like
uh sent to the shadow realm um uh for doing that so i stopped doing it
yeah
yeah they got sent to the shadow realm
yeah i had a bed in it
but the couch was like really worn down and worn out creaking and breaking it was like
like springs were popping out of it
so i stopped i had to throw it away and i slept on the floor again yay floor again floor again
i used to cut myself on that spring all the time
it was like it was like sticking out and you'd walk past it and it would just go
i'm so i'm nervous to do a
a handcam stream like handcam and are all the body streams i'm probably gonna do like cover-ups
because i have a lot of scars
i'm covered in quite a lot of scars
some of them are from my cat but um some of them are from a lot of accidents that i had so
i'm not really comfortable with showing my scars
and i know if i show you my hands you're gonna probably say i have grandma hands
because i think i do
i have really really big hands they're really like big as i'm like
i don't know how to describe it
i got yowly hands
and
i

my hands and feet have it the worst everywhere else is fine my hands and feet are
look just just make sure you guys eat don't not eat like don't eat like how i did don't eat don't
like not eat for like a week then eat like one meal a day and then skip like three meals
and stuff like that i literally couldn't eat i was really i was pretty chunky a while back
but i lost quite a lot of weight because i literally couldn't eat everything i ate just came
back up i just i couldn't keep any food down and not because like i'm like like mental issue
or something or something like like no it was my stomach issue uh ulcer of the pain
sorry for going out so early i haven't eaten anything and i still need to cook so have fun today
and i hope you can finish the game tonight slash remember your meds oh yeah i'll remember thank you
anonymous for the dollar to be appreciated too don't worry if you have to leave early make sure you
eat and drink water and stuff yeah my stomach thing was really really bad my stomach was
like very very very very very very bad i couldn't eat anything so i ended up losing like weight
like beyond what i i i should have eaten
i was like super afraid to eat anything because i was scared my stomach was gonna start hurting
and then when someone convinced me to finally eat i'd eat it and then my fears would come true
my stomach was starting i didn't understand my allergies at the time i didn't know i was
like lactose intolerant to that degree and i didn't know i was lack i was sugar intolerant
i didn't know i was i was allergic to sugar uh i'm not allergic intolerant to sugar i didn't know
i couldn't really eat bread a lot like a lot a lot of bread i couldn't i didn't know any of this
information so every time i consumed it i would have like humongous stomach aches
and then i had like a bunch of stomach acid so it would like go up and i would always constantly
feel the need to like even when nothing was in there because it would hit my esophagus
so i had a erosion i had all the problems i had did you try yogurt yogurt has milk in it too
yogurt has milk in it
i have to find brands of yogurt that didn't have milk in it and i don't know brands
i try lactose free milk but for some reason oh yeah the sugar there you go
there's sugar in some milk
so it was hard i had to i had to find i had to finally start drinking almond milk
i made a mistake and accidentally bought the sweetened version which has sugar in it
and that does it that it messed me up it messed me up
it messed me up it's horrible
i don't mind i just laugh about it i know all of you are probably like sad
that i'm talking about it but this is just i'm i this is just an experience
like i was just happy to finally find out what the fuck was wrong with me
i was happy to find out i didn't have anything extremely wrong with me or something like hella bad
because um i had a lot of like internal bleeding and they were very concerned like like we don't know what is causing this like that's that's bad
but they they were like finding out that my my like whole track system was just messed up from all the things i've been eating
and my mom was so confused she's like we've been eating these things for so long nothing was wrong
and i had to ask her i said mom have you had a normal poo poo she's like i guess she's like so you haven't had
a solid poo poo she was like no actually i haven't
she just thought it was normal she just thought it was normal to have have bad poo poo
because she's also lactose intolerant she's probably also sugar intolerant
but she never got that check
yeah
oh
but sorry my back is like
okay well let's open up one side now we've chatted for a little bit
oh excuse me that was so soft it's like you have a burp and it doesn't come out like
it comes out here like the burp usually happens like in your mouth
but that burp happened like in my esophagus that was so weird
and like my whole throat rumbled from that
that was weird
aa
Ah we're done
give me a second
I can't find the name
oh here we go

darkness time for penguin boy
let's go
how did my stomach handle the rice?
rice is fine, I don't know why
it's a really weird thing i can eat rice but like bread bread uh
because bread has sugar in it it's harder to eat bread
because the bread here in america has sugar in it bread has sugar
make sure to be careful with the bright flashing lights i have my main lights on this time so maybe
like balance it out maybe we'll balance it out
today i thought i was getting food poisoned when i eat because i love subways i used to get
subway sandwiches all the time i would get a subway sandwich and like not even like an hour later
i would be in riddering pain and i'd be on the the shitter just
but now that i know why
not that i know why uh not that i know that i'm sugar intolerant it really 100% makes sense why
subways messed me up 10 times worse than anything else
that's why i have to get like a specific bread because i know they have different types of bread
you can ask for a specific bread
or balance it with other stuff so that it doesn't make your tummy hurt all the more
can i add a garlic bread i love garlic bread is one of my favorite breads
um i think so
i eat garlic bread quite often
but not often enough so i'm not too sure because when i eat a garlic bread i'm usually probably
eating pizza on the side while i'm not sure
so

我 Add alot of stuff plugged ins.
Plugged in.
I have a lot of things plugged in.
My cable malent Health��head has been really bad.
Umm...
They have...
You know the boxes that you plug into your main outlet
and then you can plug in more things well i have three of those i have three i have three of those
and to top it all off um to top it all off the electricity running through my home isn't really
up to par
i i don't know
they want me to unplug stuff but i can't i can't i basically can't if i unplug this this
turns off that if i unplug this this turns off that if i unplug that that turns off the little fridge
with my medicine in it and then it will leak because you know that's what happens when you
unplug it for a while if i unplug that i'll be in darkness
and everything else is already off and i don't know where i don't know what cable leads to what
what cable leads to what i don't know my cable management is really bad
i don't know what i don't even know what that is i don't even know what that box is
i don't know what that is i i don't know what that is
what is that
i don't know i don't know
these are the questions we should be asking you
you
have a fire department speed up yes easy
if they make sparks and bursts
oh it'd be over a w yet i don't know
wow
a majority of the other cables are like on the other side of my room
that's connected to all their stuff that i would unplug but there's like
kind of no point unplugging it because the electricity in my home and my house is really
weird so my room is connected to my room is connected to my bathroom my living room my kitchen
the hallway and the half half of my mom's room i'm connected to all of those rooms
so like if they're pulling power if anyone turns on anything in the living room
the power in this section of the house is gonna go out
oh my god thank you raider thank you so much for the raid thank you thank you
welcome in raider hi cool thank you thank you so much for the raid
welcome in welcome in
hi hi i'm azura delay your fertility guys will be a lord it's nice to meet all of you
welcome welcome welcome to the greatest Gulf stream you'll ever have in your entire life
i like
i uh i hope your stream was really well i hope you enjoyed whatever games or little chats you had

so i had a little i had a little okay so do you have the power box in your room no it's
it's like it's in the kitchen the power box in the kitchen you go in there and you
switch but you have to pray that it's the correct one
they used to be labeled but whoever did the electricity like when they were fixing it up
they they fucked that they like switched everything all over again
it was labeled but the labels are incorrect
it's like the switch in my hallway uh do you know when you flip a switch up the light turns on
and then when you flip a switch down the light turns off well the person who came to do the
electricity turned off the power box but didn't flip the switch down so when he when they fixed it
when they fixed the light um they left the light main switch on so when you flip the switch down
the light turns on when you flip the switch up the light turns off so we have that issue
in our hallway
just the mask got it he's supposedly out there
i think my other sibling has it the best i think they're connected to
i think they're connected to the bathroom the bathroom the other half of my
my mom's room and like the middle of the middle of the hallway i think they're
connected to that so it's like only like a few outlets so they can use up a bunch of
like power in there without having issues like me but because i'm connected to the living
room there's an ac in the living room and if someone turned that on it's over
i'm good i'm like everything's gonna turn off everything my
oh summer is gonna be great
but we haven't had this issue in a while so maybe not maybe not
because my ac broke i don't have one we currently the ac was taken out
and they installed a separate outlet for the ac in the living room so i think they kind of
fixed that issue so i think it's fine but if i turn on anything extra in here i don't think
my power will be able to handle it
okay
i think it's i think it's okay it's fine
we'll be okay
it's like a hotbox in your room it's when i said that i was really hot in here i really wasn't
kidding i was not kidding it's it's baking in here i i bake in here like every day
for the last like four no for last
yeah for the last like four years four three years three four years i baked in here and i didn't
have an ac i didn't have a fan it was very hot
i streamed in that in that heat baking baking i was i was so distraught when my ac broke i was so
sad i was so so sad
hey uh how'd it go mount
crashes again
excuse me
how many electrical fires have you had one but it wasn't in this place i lived in a different place
only one but it was a faulty a faulty like microwave i think it was the microwave
it's like a faulty microwave and it was like
and i like kind of exploded not really but it smoked it was scary
it was very loud it scared me
and then my mom swore that she'll never buy a cheap kitchen appliance ever again
i have finished translating the journal by the way yay
oh that's fast what was it what was the last time we played one time
like last week it took her a week well you were out for a while yeah
anyway it looks like this journal might be meant for azura or me
oh here it's a good look for yourself
greetings
azura you can finally read this that means you're near the tower i am
the tower is the domain of an elusive entity this being is connected to the world
for now you can think of it as the spirit of the world
all it has no physical form but it can communicate through computers and other machinery
you know who i am talking about of course when you first arrived here
they're saver savior saver saver savior and no doubt contacted you right away
there is only an entity who will guide you
there's no you who guides the both of you to the tower what did i skip three words
the entry road is at the tower's base not only do you need the sun there
but also three pieces of the previous sun
savior will not be able to do anything there
you azura on the other hand
look at the pattern on the floor do as it says
the window will be gone so you need to bring it back
is that all yeah the rest of the pages were for now i guess you don't know what happened to those
nope uh i was wondering what window was supposed to be
ah well i guess it's a little hard to figure it out
figure out that one oh but i have a good night
good night good night thanks for stopping by
you
right
ᆆᆅᅱ
Here, you can have this then.
It's not a die.
A die, sorry.
It's only one, so it's a die.
Oh, it looks like me, right?
I have a little keepsake from the library.
Thank you.
No problem.
Looks like you're all set.
I only read.
I can't read.
Okay.
Okay.
Good luck now.
Thanks.
Oh, do you need me to explain again?
Yes, please.
Alright.
Oh, I don't need an explanation.
No.
I don't know this one, but...
Oh, good.
I just wanted to see if she said anything else.
I'm smart.
I'll let me get your help.
Okay, now where do we go?
Is there anything else?
Is there really like anywhere else to go?
Is that it?
Is there anything else here?
Is the game's velocity is very relaxing?
Oh, that scared me.
Oh my god.
That actually scared me so bad.
Maybe I should award the heart on that monitor.
That was not me.
That was Niko.
Those Niko's tell me, not mine.
That was Niko's tell me.
Hey Azura, do you remember that cafe?
Yes.
Oh, good.
I'm asking because...
That's actually what my stomach sounds like, by the way.
When I get hungry, it makes that exact noise.
Isn't that weird?
Wow, funny.
Maybe even louder, and then not once, but like multiple times.
Like back to back.
Like that.
I'm a little hungry.
Actually, I'm really hungry.
I don't eat anything since I got here.
So, it's okay if we go get some food before we enter the tower.
I was going to say eat the tower.
Oh my god.
I love pancakes.
Oh, pancakes.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go get a pancake.
Pancake, pancake, pancake, pancake, pancake.
He needs some milk.
Oh, we gotta go get some milk.
Pancake, pancake, pancake, pancake.

What will happen?
Are they safe in this world?
I dont know why I should not be here.
I just wanna see my mother again.
Oh, oh, they're there.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay, baby. It's okay, baby. Don't worry. Everything's gonna be just okay.
You'll find your mama. You'll meet her again.
And I'm sure you'll be able to save the world. You're a tough kid. You managed to get this far already, right?
Yeah, I'll fuck it. And you'll get to go home afterwards, right?
Right? It's okay, baby.
A. Want some more pancakes?
It's okay. It'll be fine.
Oh yeah, so yeah, thanks for coming by. Thanks for listening.
I like the person behind the cooking person, the person that makes the food.
I like them because they make food and they make pancakes and they comfort the baby for me.
I like them because they comfort the baby.
And for the pancakes.
No problem. Good luck.
Thanks. Oh, pancakes.
I'm gonna do it. Thanks.
Let's go.
I don't know.
It's okay. I don't need it.
I got this. Oh, since I'm up here, I can do this now, yeah?
Since I'm up here, might as well.
Hello? No? Nope. I'll be gone.
Bye-bye.
Hi, Platt.
Oh, wait. I think I have to go.
I have to, like, put up water and to refer to it.
I have to, like, put up water and to refer to it.
No water in the tool.
No, I don't need me to. Actually, I'm really on pancakes right now.
My stomach is making the same noise.
Okay.

I guess not. I know we don't do that.

The world is literally about to be at an end.
I would rather spend my time at peace.
At peace, relaxing until it's time.
And I run too sad for crime.
I'd rather eat, to feed me.
Maybe a food.
I'd go um-um-um.
Think about crime later.
There's no point in wishing for like a new house,
a new pair of shoes, a TV.
I don't care about that anymore.
Everything's gonna be over.
Okay, what was I supposed to do here?
No, not that.
Uh, something, a number of files, I think?
Something...
Uh, hang on.
There's a knock at my door.
So give me one second chat, I'll be right back.
I'm so jelly, ow.
I'm so jelly, ow.
See you again.

Someone got themselves something to eat, see us.

You woke up.
It's Niko.
Niko.
Is this the inside of the tower?
It's a lot darker than I thought.
Wait.
Where's the sun?
Azura?
You know what happens to the sun?
Azura?
I'm sorry baby.
No, he's a little pig. He's panicking.
He's panicking.
Come on, Azura.
Say something.
I can't. I can't talk to you baby.
I can't.
Azura.
Baby, no.
I can't. I can't talk to you.
What's going on?
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
What are you doing?
What are you doing here?
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Are you as well?
Wait.
Hang on.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry baby.
I'm sorry baby.
I'm sorry baby.
I'm sorry baby.
I'm sorry baby.
I'm sorry baby.
I'm sorry baby.
I'm sorry baby.
Can you tell? No.

Where am I supposed to go?
Where am I supposed to go?
Where am I supposed to go?
Where am I supposed to go?
Where am I supposed to go?
Where am I supposed to go?
Hello?
Congratulations, you are now inside the tower.
Are you talking to me?
Well, correct.
But you're always talking to Azura before.
Where is...?
Azura has already left.
I had to resort to contacting you directly.
Wait, so Azura is gone?
Just like that?
Correct.
I'm still here!
Don't lie to Niko, you lying computer!
We're good, correct?
Azura has already finished their mission.
And so, have you, Niko, here?
Rest now.
Please, that's happening.
It's like a bad dream.
You wake up, you'll be home.
Oh, but what's wrong?
I thought there would be more to it, you know?
I thought we were supposed to go to the top of the tower.
I thought there was supposed to be somewhere we need to put the sun.
And now, I don't even have the sun anymore.
Azura is just gone.
This feels wrong.
But you did good.
You saved the world, Niko.
Are you not happy?
I guess I am.
But it's just...
Oh.
Is this really it?
Is that it?
Neri, I'm glad to say goodbye to Azura.
Oh baby boy, I'm so sorry.
Oh.
As for me, what I do?
What I do?
As for you, Azura?
Yeah?
Yeah?
What's up?
We're done here.
Done here? What do you mean? We're done here.
Please don't return to this world anymore.
What the fuck?
What do you mean?
What just happened?
Thank you.
Thank you.
What the fuck?
They can't close.
What the fuck?
Wait.
No, I don't want to give up.
I want to help Niko.
What's that?
Only you can do something.
Well, how's if I...
What can I do?
What can I do?
What can I do?
How do I beat the evil computer person?
I think I'll uninstall the game or reinstall it.
Task manager?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Is there anything new in here?
Not really.
No, there's nothing new in here.
Let me check elsewhere.
Oh my god, I thought that said program but plug, but it said program bug check.
What the fuck?
I'm so confused.
I'm so confused.
Ever read?
What's on my mind?
Save Niko.
Save Niko is on my mind right now.
So look elsewhere?
Where else would you look?
On my desktop?
Got minimize stuff, hang on.
Oh, what's this?
Oh no, that's not anything new.
I know what that is.
It knows nothing on my desktop.
How strange.
What am I looking for?
I'm looking for something that's a hint.
What is that?
Tell a dildon?
What?
What is this?
There's more than one way to open the game?
Oh, well an administrator.
How's what you open the game?
Put an administrator from the file itself.
There's a bolder.
Yeah, there's a couple of files here.
There's this one and then this one.
Can't, could not initialize.
Do I delete one?
We've got another thing to open.
This one.
Yeah, I have it open.
What about it?
I have it open right now.
Is it supposed to do anything?
Oh shit.
That actually scared me.
Are we saving Niko?
Niko.
Hello?
Azura?
Was that you just now?
I thought I heard your voice.
We back, we did it!
I almost already missed it.
I'm saving the world.
Yeah, save the world!
I'm in a dream.
Ah, I guess you're still not there.
There's something in my pocket.
I don't remember what I got there.
Oh yeah, oh.
A computer's on again.
You're still here.
Niko, why are you still here?
Oh god, it's angry at me!
The computer's angry!
It's angry at me!
It's angry!
You said you.
Why did you come back Azura?
I told you to stay away!
You knew.
I tried to cut the story short.
Is that it?
You want more out of me?
Is that it?
Fine.
You don't want to leave?
I'll make sure you never do.
Eh?
What's going on?
I'm scared.
See?
Oh, this is how you do this!
I got it! I got it! I'm smart! I'm smart!
I got this! Wait, hang on.
And then...
Wait.
Hang on.
Wait, I'm smart. Hang on, I'm cooking.
Hang on, hang on.
Eh?
Oh, I didn't even read it. Something happened.
It said something on the first one. I didn't read it.
I didn't read it. I didn't read it.
Oh, no.
Oh!
It said, back then, I told you about the entity.
As little as possible.
And then it says...
Apologies for that.
I did not want to put the library in a danger.
And then we go this way.
And then, I did.
I did.
I did.
This being has a habit of silencing the people
to learn of its true nature.
And we just keep going this way.
Hang on, hang on.
I can't read sideways.
Regrettably, I have seen it happen to dear friends.
That's what's up.
Let's play.
I do not worry. The entity cannot touch you.
We go back this way.
Nor can it do anything to me.
Okay, back this way, back this way.
I already left the world on my own terms.
Hang on this way.
Oh.
I never meant for the entity to exist.
But now that it is fully sentient,
one thing became clear.
The entity seeks death.
Where?
So.
Death to itself, death to the world.
A relentless desire that manifested physically.
So.
You have already seen the scars.
Yeah.
Right now, the entity is doing everything it can
to impede your progress.
Stalling for even a few minutes.
I think it was this one.
Before you inevitably bring the sun to the tower summit.
This is so much work.
So much work.
That is where you, God, will make the final judgment for the world.
Of course, the entity will contact you again there.
And when it does, it will trick you into shattering the sun.
This will end the world instantly.
Wait, what just happened? Did I go to the wrong door?
Oh, I think I went to the wrong door.
No? Or is it just silence?
Okay, this is scaring me.
No, no.
It is not that simple.
I'm sorry.
I do not know what to do in a situation like this.
I, I'm, what's happening?
But I think I have to tell you the truth.
The sun is the Messiah's tide to the world.
Oh, no. I'm not going to remember that.
Where'd it go?
Hey, come back!
Where are you?
If only you guys could see what I have to freaking do.
What I have to do?
As long as the sun is intact, the Messiah remains trapped here.
Yeah, here.
And then all the way down, this side, this side, this side, this side.
Bad hurry.
It remains trapped here.
What do I do?
What do I do wrong?
Is it the opposite way?
I don't think so.
No. What?
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I don't understand.
Is it like a specific way?
I am not good with puzzles.
I think you guys already figured out that I'm horrendously bad with puzzles.
Yeah, it's making a shape.
But this is the shape. It looks like this.
This is the shape it's making.
It stops there.
Oh! Oh my gosh!
I can hang on. I think I got it.
My shoulder just popped. I felt so good.
Shattering the sun may terminate this world, but...
How can I make everything big?
How am I supposed to find that?
There's no way I'm going to find that.
Okay, I got this.
Okay, so first...
Oh shit. Like that.
Let's go!
I'm amazing.
My memory is so bad, but I did it.
Oh shit.
Oh shit.
I spoke too soon.
They gave me something much harder.
Oh my god.
I see.
This is a test all along.
Oh, they don't like me.
Oh, they don't like me at all.
I didn't read the last letter, did I?
I think I did.
Something about shattering.
It is also the only way for the Messiah to return home.
Okay, oh, there you go.
Okay, let's start.
Let's start here.
Okay.
And then...
Oh shit.
Why is there a bug?
You know, crazy.
There you go.
Okay.
I feel like I'm cooking very slowly.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
And then...
Shit, shit.
Oh shit.
Okay.
I'm doing this.
I'm doing this.
I'm doing it.
Okay.
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
Oh shit.
Okay.
This is here.
Here.
Here.
Okay, can I leave?
I missed a spot.
Okay.
I did it.
I did it.
I did not realize things could end up like this.
Please forgive me.
Okay.
There's a light bulb.
I guess it's here.
I don't know why.
Where is it coming from?
There you go.
I'm here.
I'm here baby.
Yay.
Yeah.
Is that really you?
I thought you were gone.
I never loved you.
I was really a bit scared back there.
I thought I was completely alone.
That was silly of me to assume, wasn't it?
No baby, it wasn't.
I guess we need to figure out where to go now.
What is that?
A song.
Is that on a song?
I guess we should pick it up.
Right Azura?
Everything's so small.
I think it screams out by accident.
There again?
It's all neatly stacked.
It's all cleaned up.
It's not broken the last time.
There's nothing in the fridge.
Did you hear that?
Was it the first closing?
It was.
I got a little spooked.
Wait, what's in here?
I had a friend at home.
I had a friend at home, what does that mean?
I don't know where the light is coming from.
We'll turn it on.
A little tree.
It's a mirror.
It's a toilet.
I don't know.
So, you actually made it here.
I guess you're in Azura.
I'll tell you how to save the world then.
You reached the summit.
Shattered the lightbulb.
I'm just humoring you.
I know you've been getting help from a certain someone.
This computer is scary.
He didn't already told you about the choice.
Baby?
Are you still planning to save the world, Azura?
Why are you trying so hard for this?
Haven't you even figured out what this world is?
I told you at the beginning, your mission is to help Niko leave.
Because Niko isn't part of this world.
Niko is the only thing worth saving here.
The final choice is up to you.
I can't go against my programming.
You only have one shot, Azura.
If you choose to smash the lightbulb, then Niko wakes back up.
Back home, like it was all a dream.
Niko returns the sun.
The child will have to bear the weight of this sacrifice.
At least, tell Niko the truth.
You don't care about Niko, do you?
I don't care about Niko.
I don't care about Niko.
I don't care about Niko.
I'm sure it's taking a while.
I guess this elevator leads to the top of the tower, Azura.
Are you excited, Azura?
Or are you finally going to say bye now?
I know it's the realest time.
What is there here?
And then...
I have to go home for real this time, too.
I can't wait to see everyone again.
Are you okay, Azura?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.

I don't want the world to be destroyed.
I don't want the world to be destroyed.
Hang on, hang on, hang on. What's this?
I like tilted my head so hard that my whole neck thick.
Wait, what do I do?
Don't worry, give me one second.
Hmm?
Wait, is it in here?
Import, no, that's not what that is.
No, no, no, no.
Hang on, hang on.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
Hang on, hang on.
I just got an achievement.
What did I do?
Wait, what just happened?
Hello?
I thought we started over.
What did I do?
Say that word, sir.
Why does it sound so familiar?
Okay, all right, give me a second.
Okay, all right.
Okay, cool, that's cool.
Hi, what's this?
What are you doing in here? You shouldn't be in there. Why are you in there?
It looks like you were able to remove the restriction.
In that case, you are ready to continue. The necessary preparations are already in place.
This is a night run, very different or depending on your actions.
If you can recognize my symbol, you'll know what you should do.
I confess, it will be risky.
The probability that the entity is conditioned or worsened is quite high.
And if that happens, then the hints are here.
Hang on.
Look at me, asking you for favors only to become so apprehensive once you agree.
I understand if you wish to leave some questions unanswered.
I understand if you do not believe in a happy resolution.
I understand if you are simply afraid of all my habit.
Because I am afraid too.
No one.
If you enjoy the world as it is, if you are satisfied with the story as it is,
if you really do not want to see anything change or better or worse, then pretend you never saw this.
Carry the session as you normally would.
Do not use my journal or anything other than what you are already familiar with.
This option will always remain for you though.
That's why I implore you to consider the Messiah,
the world, my children.
They all deserve their good ending.
Thank you for listening. Goodbye.
Is the person who sent us the letters the actual God of this world?
See me.
Solstice.
Access granted.
Thank you.
Hi.
Hi.
You found me.
Why?
You are ready to leave. Not much of the world remains.
This will be apparent when she goes outside.
This place was never worth saving. Do you still want to try?
Do you remember this? Your actions will affect you.
Your mission.
Your style will make you leave.
And most importantly...
No.
This does not feel right at all. Have we already been through this?
But that should be impossible. You only had one shot.
I wasn't supposed to exist after that.
Here is the sound of a door locking.
Azura? That sounds so familiar.
I'll turn it on.
Dusty books. So dark are you here.
Weather, plants, it's here.
I'm going to see a little eyeball.
Hello? Hello? Anyone?
How did we do this again?
Do we have to do everything all over again?
Where did we go?
What did we do again?
What did we do again?
What did we do again?
What did we do again?
What did we do again?
What did we do again?
What did we do again?
What did we do again?
What did we do again?

What did we do?
What did we do again?
What did we do again?
What did we do again?
My eyes.
My eyes.
What did we do again?
What did we do again?
What did we do again?
What did we do again?
Okay, it's over.
There's no bud here.
How are you?
How are you?
What am I supposed to be looking for?
The light bulb, you are here.
I am the most humbled by your presence.
I am sorry, it triggered my theory.
I am sorry, it triggered my theory.
I like how my Siri responds.
What is it?
Is anyone else's Siri does that?
They have such a peppy tone in their voice. I like it.
I didn't used to do that before.
I am an android peasant.
I used to be an android peasant too.
But a lot of jobs that I worked at required that I had an iPhone.
I had no choice.
I had no other choice but to switch to the dock side.
I remember the old Australian English female PA working for a bookstore team.
All extra in the trenches, prepaid foam. Crazy.
We went so far back in time. I feel old now after you said that.
He has a burner.
I woke up in this new house. It was really dark.
I will not fight him.
I woke up in this house.
I remember something about that.
My brain is weak. Give me one second.
You do?
How was the one who was supposed to inform you of that?
I don't know.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I want to know what I need to do.
I want to know what I need to do.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't remember.
Does anyone remember the code?
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you are.
I gotta become a robot too. Hang on.
There you go.
Man, scratching your ear just feels so good.
Are you okay? You were starting to black out.
I saw something. It was like a really short dream just now.
I saw something like a robot with a yellow eye. That's strange.
Are you sure you're okay? Yeah. You know how you have mentioned it.
There's a robot always insisting on going back.
It's not a bad end of the line.
That's why I hope one of the minds have been in despair.
Kobe's okay. He doesn't look broken or anything.
But I don't. I didn't really see him. See him. You know?
He said it was kind of a dream. He was up close.
It was like some kind of shell glitch or hallucination.
Whatever it is. That living being.
It is that living beings have.
There's a robot, you know. I hope to have a yellow eye.
I don't think you've seen any other robots like that.
I would not know. I didn't prevent it myself.
I only heard of your friend tonight. Your friend.
Hold on. Something. My pocket is.
Oh.
What?
That wasn't going before. What is this?
It's going to be my question. Who did you have?
Oh. It was with me when I woke up.
I didn't really question it at the time.
I flipped through a couple of pages but I'm not sure where it is.
Is that just something that's either supposed to make up it?
No. I have never heard of anything like that.
But I know a world that's dark.
Huh? Never.
I've only seen this book with a black glover on the cover.
Hey, what did the trouble of putting yellow phosphor in it?
The fact that you woke up is it?
In the first place. Really just a dream.
It was phosphor. But yeah, it's a rare, rare, rare, rare phosphor.
I don't think the sun is middle.

Spiders are friends, some of them, some of them are friends.
How spider is a friend, other ones are not so friend.
Not so friend.
I did tuck my toe in it's home.
So it's technically my fault.
I put my toesies in it's home.
I probably messed up it's like web.
And then it came to investigate.
It's my fault.
It's my fault.
And I kinda hurt the scooter.
It's just a splutter.
It made a little home there.
Normally I'm not really back there so it's fine.
It could be back there.
I don't know where it went this time.
I probably scared it somewhere.
Hopefully.
I won't be in.
I probably startled it really bad.
As well.
We startled each other.
Don't hurt the scooter.
Wait a minute.
How do I know this?
I don't think anyone's told me about it.
I can show you if you like.
My friend gave me this one time ago.
Pretty.
Wow.
Looks like there's a clover in the necklace too.
Like in the book.
Wow.
It is the same person.
Oh?
That's why I think this journal would be important.
You said it just started glowing?
Yeah.
That was right after your vision.
This has made something.
We should at least try to read it again.
Oh.
I found this.
It looks kind of like a drawing of this room.
Maybe it's telling us we should come here.
But she's here already.
So it looks like we're on the right track.
We're on the right track.
Oh, that one.
What do you do?
I just wake the journal a bit closer.
Wait.
Wait.
I have it.
Wait.
It's a clover.
It's a clover on the floor.
It's a clover on the floor.
Whoa.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you for stopping by.
I hope you have a wonderful night.
And dream of me.
Sweet sweet.
Sweet sweet.
Sweet sweet.
Sweet sweet.
Sweet sweet.
Sweet sweet.
Sweet sweet.
Sweet sweet.
Sweet sweet.
Sweet sweet.
Sweet beautiful dreams of me.
What just happened?
I'm not sure.
I wasn't looking.
To be honest, neither was I.
I was just taking a closer look at the journal.
And then I found this page.
It looks like a drawing of this room.
I look back up.
This is my card to show it up.
Out of the there.
Should I be worried?
This looks like a standard issue in my card though.
Which means
it likely detected the motion in this room.
Since it's a clover.
That doesn't make sense.
Not really.
Doesn't make sense to me.
I'm just surprised it still works.
Yes.
Excuse me.
I'm not sure why you would want to visit the Deeper Minds.
But
If you wanted to.
We now have that option.
Is the mind card even going to fit both of us?
No.
But I wanted you to come with us.
I know I've got a sore butt.
Honestly, this place just
This place gives me the creeps.
I sneezed?
What?
Did I actually?
Thank you.
I don't remember sneezing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Have I sneezed?
What?
What?
What?
What?
I don't remember sneezing.
What?
I know I've got a sore butt.
Have you read this?
I can still come with.
I just
I would just have to follow along the way.
Doesn't it look a little
precarious?
A big word
for a little cat.
A big word for a little cat.
Precarious.
The magnetic
magnetic rails
can hold me
in place.
It's only ever dangerous
to walk on
if you're an organic being
which
you are.
Gotcha.
Wrong button.
I'm only waiting here
for the evening.
Let's go.
Right away.
How do I?
Okay, here we go.
Hello.
Do you
need anything?
I like her.
I like her a lot.
I really like her.
I like her face.
I like her face.
I'm heading to sleep. Good night.
Have a good night.
Thank you for stopping by today's stream.
Good night.
No. Okay.
Okay.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
Hello.
Hello.
So,
hello.
So,
hello.
I
do not recognize this place
and protocol.
This
this isn't what I'm supposed to be
showing you at all.
How did you get here?
I thought about
this.
I've been doing this.
It doesn't matter at this point.
You're going out of bounds.
Please turn back.
Please turn back.
I think it's annoying to happen.
Very bad things.
At this rate,
I think it will be a danger.
Please turn back.
Hello?
Hmm?
What's wrong?
I...
I have a bad feeling about this.
I'm sorry.
It's like I should not be here.
Do you want to go back then?
I don't know.
What do you think, sir? Should we head back?
Continue.
As soon as we should keep going.
We're going to continue.
Or it's until the unknown continues.
I'm listening to the omnipresent computer.
Ever been a good thing?
Adventure!
Alright.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Continue.
Turn around.
They give you so much time to change your mind.
They give you so much time to change your mind.
That's really scary.
They give you so much time to change your mind.
Hello?
Huh?
That was your last chance to change your mind?
Assuming...
Oh.
The card stopped.
Looks like this is as far as tracks go.
So...
Where are we?
That was the oldest observation room.
Looks like...
It's still mostly intact.
Ooh.
What?
Huh?
The terminal just reactivated.
The power was cut off so long ago.
Weird.
Maybe it runs on battery?
No.
That's not it.
Whatever it is.
Okay.
Maybe okay by yourself for a bit.
Don't worry, it's the rest with me.
Alright.
Excuse me.
I was like a burp in my throat.
Minecraft server room?
Minecraft!
Minecraft!
It's a sort of computer.
What was the guy idea?
Looks like these terminals are running on a completely separate power source.
I can't really recognize any of the data format on this terminal either.
It's all new.
Or at least encrypted.
It will need to...
I will need to analyze it in my own system.
I'll take some time.
So...
You don't need to stay.
Isn't these one of the machines that belong to a robot?
I don't know what it is.
I can feel my hair standing up a little.
Whoa.
It's a blue robot.
The music's gone.
Hi.
Recognize the light in your eyes?
You are the person I'm destined to meet.
What is your name?
Hi, Nico.
Do you know who sent you?
Oh.
Oh.
Wait.
Do you mean...
Who sent me to this world?
I know the robot a lot.
Parker told me about how I am the Messiah and stuff.
Oh, excuse me.
Hey!
That was a mosquito.
Literally...
Die.
Did I get it?
Probably not.
It was resting on my arm.
That's going to be itchy later.
Do you know I'm allergic to certain type of mosquito?
You know those mosquitoes with the black stripes on it?
The black and white or is it white stripes?
There's a mosquito with white stripes on it.
I'm allergic to that mosquito.
If it bites me, I turn into a balloon.
I only found this out when I was at a park.
When I was younger, I was at a park.
And I was playing in the sprinklers.
And that mosquito landed on me.
And they had white stripes on it.
And then it bit me on my arm.
And then I like shoot it away, went home.
And then my arm turned into a giant balloon.
My whole entire arm.
Hahaha.
I'm allergic to that kind of mosquito.
I can't let that one bite me.
Specifically that one.
Hahaha.
The regular mosquitoes are fine.
It's just a little itchy.
I'm also allergic to certain trees, dust mites.
I'm allergic to cat hair.
But that didn't stop me.
I still had a cat.
I had multiple cats.
I'm allergic to citrus.
I'm allergic to...
Some other things I can't remember.
I'm allergic to the bark of trees.
Like certain trees.
I don't remember what kind of trees though.
Pine trees?
And another like two different kinds of trees and plants.
Hahaha.
Does that mean you're allergic to lemons?
Sort of, kind of, yes.
But not to like an extreme.
Like, not to like an extreme.
I'm not allergic to these things to an extreme.
Except for the tree bark.
Apparently I had a pretty bad reaction to that.
When they did the test on me.
Hahaha.
Hahaha.
But it wasn't like extreme.
Like, oh really bad.
Hahaha.
But every, like citrus just makes my throat a little swollen and itchy.
Just a little bit.
Just a little bit.
Not too bad.
My favorite fruit is literally mango.
So...
Hahaha.
You're allergic to oak hickory.
Me too!
I think oak hickory.
And something else.
But I don't think I'm allergic to pecan.
I think I'm allergic to pecan.
I'm allergic to like a bunch of various trees.
You should get an allergy test.
Don't tell you.
But the place I went and got an allergy test at.
They only did.
Just like the common things.
They only did allergy test for common things.
Not for all the other stuff.
Yeah pine trees oak.
Hickory.
And some other trees.
No.
Actually I'm not allergic to pine.
Am I?
I don't remember.
Am I allergic to pine tree?
I don't think so.
I remember touching a pine tree.
And breaking out into a rash.
But I remember us owning a pine tree when I was younger.
And I was really, really little.
And I remember not being able to breathe.
Around this tree.
That's all I remember.
I don't remember anything else.
My memory is very foggy.
Very very very foggy.
When it comes to thinking about that tree.
Um.
Um.
Um.
I don't think my throat closed up though.
I don't think my throat closed up.
I don't think my throat closed up.
I think.
I think it triggered an asthma attack.
I think it triggered an asthma attack.

more than ten years ago so I think it's just best not to worry about it there's no need to worry about it I haven't been worried about it because it's been way more than ten years it's been over ten years since that time so it's literally a childhood memory childhood time so I don't know I don't remember
so we moved past it and I've been living just fine without that memory though it does kinda give me headaches trying to remember stuff and when things suddenly pop up in my head and I suddenly remember something random
so it happens that is what it is
alright moving on game there was a robot a while back who told me about um science stuff so um my head really hurts give me one second I'm gonna have to do good
sorry
um
okay
that's gonna take a little bit to kick in and it'll be fine
yeah let's go
I'm okay it's fine
ow man
so I'm guessing Azura sent me
and with them being god and all the robot looks a little bit like you even
maybe you know each other I cannot say
oh a lot of my memories have been removed for safety reasons your memories were removed
that's terrible wait I'm guessing that's less of a big deal for a robot
I'm going to assume you do not know who sent you how did you get here then how did you reach this room
I got here in a mine cart when the mine cart wasn't there when you entered the mines was it
yeah so that is fine I didn't really find it
about 8 things it was just a mine cart coming through but I remember looking at the journal
it happened and when I looked up again the car was just there
poof just like that interesting
okay I should do this journal
then
words then it has already begun
Nico's face
here
what is that
I'm interesting you with my main memories
you have passed the first test
you are showing me the walk
now you will need to find a way to install the backup
install it
before you do that though someone else is with you right
someone aside from Azura
a resident of Azura's world
yeah a robot lady
she's in the chamber and she's in the chamber and she's in the chamber
she's in the computer room right now
then if we
please do not tell her you found me
at least not yet
I can't be seen like that
okay
please help me restore my memory
bring this back once you have the backup
110, 111, 121, 181, 131, this thing
residents with tracking machine
we're residents at rivers
my brain is like shutting down
every time I try to speak my
