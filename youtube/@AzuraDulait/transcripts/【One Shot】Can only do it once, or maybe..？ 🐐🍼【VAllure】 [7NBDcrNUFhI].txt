I'm already like in a little bit of pain so I took an electric bike
To the to the store yeah
To get to the store
You guys you guys
I
I ate you I ate it I ate it I ate it hard
I ate it
I fell so hard my legs was twisted in between the bike
I I was laying on the ground for like a minute that a bunch of people crowded around me to see if I was alive
It was bad, but I'm fine. Don't worry. I'm fine now. Don't worry
No, I didn't land on my face thankfully I put my hands out in front of me
um
I don't know what happened like
the wheel like just went out of control and then
Uh, I think I hit something because I felt a bump
and the wheel just started like
Wiggling out of control and no matter how much I turned the steering at the top
To get it straight it wouldn't go straight
And it was over. I knew it was over
I I I bit my tongue and I just said oh well is that goodbye everybody
And I and I fell I ate it
Yeah
Um, I hurt like my whole left side um pretty bad
During that entire ASMR stream I was in a lot of pain
Only one of you guys to worry so I was like I'll tell them tomorrow
I'll tell them tomorrow. Stoney was like you should cancel stream
No, that's fine. It's fine. Everything's okay
So currently my leg is a little swollen
I hit my shoulder my elbow
And my all on my left side and my right but she kind of hurt
I
You died of embarrassment. No, I was fine. I was it's it's crazy because I expected people to laugh
If someone would have started laughing then I'd probably be embarrassed, but no
No one laughed. I think they were very concerned. I really think they thought I was
Not a single person laughed
So I have like ice on it right now. I've had ice on it since yesterday and
And my whole body is so sore
I think I like flipped I don't know. I think I like flipped I think I like flipped I think I like flipped
I think I like flipped I don't even know how I ended up on my back because I fell forward
So I think I flipped like I did a roller some side some type of something
Because I fell forward with my hands out
Slid on my hands and then somehow ended up on my back
And I just laid there for a minute
I
Survive another to another day I'll live I'll be fine. It's nothing worse than
Other incidents I had
I had incidents where my finger got jammed in a
In a safe
Uh
Was an accident
Finger got slammed in it
Big big heavy metal safe
I split my finger
Finger
In two
I've had worse injuries right that's that's fine that
It was fine. It's perfectly fine
I think that's one of the worst injuries I had
Was the finger thing and I've had various others
but
so
There was no need for me to go to a doctor. It's fine as long as the bruise didn't turn like
Colors and
And that would be fine if it was like black and blue
Then maybe I would have maybe I would have to go see a doctor
But the skin tone and everything nothing changed just a big giant bump with the little bruise on the top
I got a little bump on my my forehead, but I'm very sure I didn't land on my head
So maybe something hit me there, but I don't know
But I'm fine
Did I do a backflip? I think it was a front flip. I think that's what you call a front flip
Maybe a backflip. I don't know. I don't remember
I only remember making sure I didn't want to land on my head
I had to protect my head at all costs. I did not have a helmet on so
My my head was my main my head and neck was my main concern when I fell so I made sure to fall on the way I didn't land on my head
So everyone remember to wear a helmet ride safely. It doesn't matter how slow you're going
Wear a helmet wear a helmet
It doesn't matter how slow you're going. You can move like a snail. It does not matter
Stay safe. Do not do what I did. I was unsafe even though I know I can easily get injured. I was
Don't do what I did
I
I'm good. Don't worry. I'm fine. Don't worry about me though. Okay. I'm fine
I can laugh about it now. I was laughing about it then. I was literally laughing when I fell
Everyone came over and they were like, are you okay? And I just gave them a thumbs up like
Just a big old thumbs up
I
Always wear protection
When riding a bike
Yes, or riding any feel-good
um that that doesn't
Required you to be inside of it like a
Even even then even inside of a like a race car. You still wear a helmet because you're going really fast
Yeah
Yeah
No, don't be worried. I'm fine. I'm fine. I promise. I promise
I'm just healing now. It's all that matters. It's a little bit of healing
I took some pink color so
Soon I will kick in and I'll be fine
I just want to chat it up with you guys. I told you about what happened yesterday
I wanted to stream a little longer
Yesterday, but I was like
I don't think I can keep going

I set up donation alerts
Um, they're set up now. I think I hope I think I hope

But I set them up and I'm very proud of myself because it took me so long to figure it out
I couldn't figure it out. I swear
So I have that and
Yes, um the tips through stream elements have also been fixed
So you can send the donation tips through there now
And the link is in the description if you need it

I have been using really bad equipment a while back
So I'm not used to the
this
equipment uh sharoni had helped me get um so
I'm still learning how to use it
And uh man sound has been helping with uh with it a lot uh so
And now it's just up to me to really figure out how a majority of it work
Since microphones are very different from each other
Asmr microphone picks up everything
Every single sound so I had a filter on it, but
Uh
It did not work
I'll wear one I promise thank you. Thank you for the $4 don't know thank you. Thank you
No worries your learning experience. Yes, please. I hope you'll have patience with me. I'm still learning
I

I think that should be good
If you need it louder, let me know
Bye bye thanks for stopping by
Um
I'm like I'm like
I opened something and I shouldn't have opened it. I don't know how to pronounce it. Oh, there we go. Yay
I figured that out. Oh my gosh. Why was that so hard?
It shouldn't have been that hard
Yay
All my boys suits are mine, grand. I'm very happy with those
After
I
I'm so like unprepared I was so prepared but unprepared, you know
You know how you have everything set up and you're like ready and you're like, I'm gonna do this
I won't do that and then now you're just like
Oh, yeah
I also did want to mention that I uh
Want to do more asmrs, but we're probably gonna have to
Tone it down because our cookie eating was too much for youtube
so
We're gonna have to tone down the cookie eating
And and stick to just some brushing
some brazes and requests and stuff
I
And some milk pouring I like doing the milk pouring that was pretty fun
We can test a few limits, but sadly
All right
Yes, I only say I agree
Um
We're gonna get started on the one shot
I had a really good sleep
Last last night, so I'm really like
Still feeling the effects of the heart
So
Can you hear that is or is it too loud
What does that sound you ask what is that sound
Do you really want to know you want to know what that sound is?
Yeah
Do you want to know
Well, that sound is
One shot
One shot
The game is a block

Yes, yes. Yeah, one of my favourites.
I never really think about a favourite game.
I play it and I go, I like this.
And then I move on.
I like this. This is nice.

Let me rest in peace.
I'm not going to remember any of this, by the way.
Arrows.
Arrows.
So it's only keyboard, no mouse.
Examines z.
Examines z.
X to Council.
Array.
Walk faster, shift.
A for Ming and Bra.
S for M for Bra.
S for C.
I'm not going to remember any of this.
Let's get started.
Explore and interact with the environment and characters.
Sometimes you may find an item.
Once you have picked up an item,
you may select it from your inventory.
When the item is active, you can either combine it with other items in the inventory
or use it at certain locations in order to progress.
Array.
I played this game like really really really really really long time ago.
So I remember nothing.
Maybe like some things here and there.
Uh, I don't remember.
A proven broad.
Uh.
Although full screen is an option, the game is best experienced in window mode.
Really? How do you exit window mode? I mean how do you exit full screen mode?
Oh.
Oh.
But it's so little I can't see.
It's so little.
It's so tiny.
Glasses?
I have glasses.
I got reading glasses.
No, it won't let you resize it.
It's so tiny.
It's so little.
Small.
I'm making it big and there's no way.
There's no way I can see.
Okay.
I love the green man.
The green man is a really good anime.
One of my favorites actually.
One of my favorites.
I have many favorites.
Okay.
This is fine.
I might try to move this over here.
Oh, my shoulder.
We're fine.
Everything's fine.
Hmm.
Hello there.
Hello?
Hello there.
Oh.
I'm giving up.
In what password?
Access denied.
Dusty books.
That's too dark to read in here.
The soft glowing light trickles through the window.
What's this?
It's even out here.
Niko picks up the door.
What's in here?
Door's locked.
Door's locked.
Hiya.
Oh, terrible.
No.
I don't know what we do at the senior level.
Okay.
What the?
Hello?
Hello?
What do I do?
Oh.
The game sound is louder than my voice.
I turn it down.
Don't worry, I turn it down.
I turn it down.
Is that better?
Is that better?
I can turn myself up, actually.
What am I always down there?
What the fuck?
How did that happen?
Why am I always down there?
Oh, there we go.
Is that better?
Let me know if I'm too loud, okay?
Am I just...
Am I just dumb?
Am I just dumb?
How do you use an item?
How do you use an item?
What?
What?
What?
What? I don't...
I don't understand.
I woke up here.
The door is locked.
What?
I don't remember.
What do I do?
Help me.
Maybe something has to do with this window.
Maybe I hold this in my hand.
Or something.
Ah!
In the faint light,
you can glimpse
the face of the remote.
Ah! All of our numbers accept.
Zero, six, three.
Seven are missing.
Zero, six, three.
Zero.
No.
This is six, this is three, yeah?
X is granted.
Okay. Ah, computer.
I'm in.
Let's go!
Okay.
You found me.
Why?
You're already too late.
Not much of the world remains.
This will be apparent once you go outside.
This place was never worth saving.
Do you still want to try?
I remember this.
Your actions here will affect Miko.
You talking to me?
You talking to me?
Your mission is to help Miko leave.
And most importantly,
Oh!
You only have one shot.
Azura.
This will be so fun.
If I was on like
display,
I'll show you my monitor.
And you guys can see the little things pop up too.
It makes it small windowed again.
No, I gotta make it big.
Here we go.
Miko, here's the sound of a door unlocking.
A weathered plant sits here,
stiff and dry.
A branch snaps off.
A branch.
It's me! It's me, I'm Miko.
I'm Miko.
Miko, Miko
Miko, Miko
Miko, Miko
Miko, Miko
Miko, Miko
A pair of luminous yellow eyes stare back at Miko.
There's no water in the toilet.
Are you gonna take a poop ball?
Let's help won't run.
Dang, Miko stinky.

What's this?
What's this?
What's this?
What's this?
What's this?
Stairs.
Very long stairs.
It's a light bulb.
You can fill the empty bottle with milk.
It's a light bulb.
Flashbang!
I have a sensitivity to light.
My poor eye.
Yeah, we're fine.
I'm gonna have to use some eye drops later.
I have a light bulb.
The urge to break it is real.
It's left of a computer terminal.
What in here?
I might have to dim the brightness.
You can quickly travel to the locations you have already visited by selecting the fast travel option in the menu.
You wanna know something funny?
When I played this game the first time, I didn't know there was a fast travel option.
Did you know I walked everywhere on foot?
That's the only thing I remember from this game.
I walked everywhere on foot.
The default key for opening the menu is A.
I didn't mind it.
I like the slight realism of just walking everywhere.
It was fun.
It wasn't. It wasn't added there in the start. It's new.
Well, that makes sense.
That makes sense.
I played it when there wasn't a fast travel then because I walked everywhere.
It was fun though.
I remember getting lost in this place. A robot.
And no longer has power.
There's a robot left.
There's a robot left.
I don't like long walks.
I don't know why that scared me, but it did.
There's a robot left.
I don't know why that scared me.
I don't know why that scared me.
Thanks.
Sorry. I'm a little lost.
Alright. Allow me to explain some things.
May I first ask how you arrived here?
I'm not sure.
I woke up in this weird house.
It was really dark.
So you woke up in an unfamiliar dark location?
Just as my prophecy foretold, yes.
You are the savior we have been waiting for.
You will be the one to save our world from internal darkness.
I will now provide you with vital information.
Please ask me anything.
Well, can you tell me about this world?
I'm not sure where I am exactly.
I can't see too far off everything so dark.
Our world was not always this dim.
Tomorrow was it so broken.
But time waits for nobody, not even saviors.
The world is divided into three regions.
You are on the fringe right now, the barons.
The tower you see in the distance once held our sun.
Oh, so that's what the tall thing was?
As you go further toward the center, you will cross the other regions.
There should be a map still.
And this outpost somewhere.
Oh, can you tell me about the label?
I found it in the house I woke up in.
But then your hands is our new sun.
Bro, I can't read your sun.
It's child. He's holding his child.
Yes, years ago, our previous sun set atop that tower
and spilled its life into the land.
But one day, the light went out.
Oh.
The world is still hanging on by a thread.
The surface of this world is abundant with an element called phosphor.
Fortunately for us, this element stored light, energy from our previous sun.
It's now our only source of illumination.
But its energy is...
Vinnit! Vinnit! Find it!
Find it! Find it! Find it! Find it! Find it! Find it!
ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ�
Good night.
Sleep well.
When the last of the light dies, our world will too.
Ah.
But now that you are here, with the new sun, all is well.
You will need to restore it to the power.
That looks pretty far off.
Yes.
So begins your pilgrimage.
Also, the sun is fragile.
So be careful.
If the sun shatters, the world will end in an instant.
Oh.
Can you tell me about a computer?
In the house, I found this computer.
It kept saying stuff like, your actions here will affect Niko.
But I'm Niko.
I'm Niko. I'm Niko.
Yes, you are Niko.
Are those messages meant for someone else?
Hmm.
If I had to guess, they might be trying to pass the message to Azura.
It's me!
It's me!
Azura!
It's me!
Azura?
That would be our god.
I'm your god.
Your goddess.
Azura.
Dule.
If you are here, that means Azura is here also.
Azura will provide guidance for your journey.
In fact, they already have.
Really?
I haven't seen anyone else, anyone though.
Have you not contacted Azura yet?
I don't think so.
Being the bringer of our sun, you have the sacred ability to communicate directly with Azura.
Ah, an ability that no one else possesses.
Certainly not I.
Hmm? Hmm?
Please close your eyes and focus.
Alright.
Hello? Azura? Are you there?
Yes, I am.
Oh, nice to meet you, Azura.
My name is Niko.
I see you too, Niko. You are so cute.
That's horrible.
I actually heard someone.
They said their name is Azura.
This is incredible.
Do not be afraid to ask Azura for assistance.
You are a messiah after all.
Can you tell me about going home?
Home. I don't mean to be rude, but I'm not sure about this.
I still don't know how I got here.
I was just with my mama a few hours ago.
And now it feels like I'm in a bad dream.
I just want to go home.
Your mission is to save our world.
Just as my mission is to tell you about our world,
I'm unable to help you beyond my programming.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
I think that's all I have to ask for now.
Excellent.
I wish you luck.
Going on here?
It's in there.
A robot without power.
Dusty shells.
Where does the shell splutter?
The use of a robot as our placement had engineer seems unorthodox.
Especially the one responsible for the last year's incident.
I suppose they had to get her away from the city.
But that doesn't make it easier to swallow for those of us who worked here.
I hope that man knows what he's doing.
Management.
Dusty shells.
Where does the shell?
Where does the shell?
The faded poster.
Reminder to all workers,
the rarest form of blue phosphor is found during the fall.
The rarest form of blue phosphor is found during the fall.
The rarest form of blue phosphor is found during the phosphor shrimp spawn.
Period.
If you observe a pond with a bubbled over surface, please contact management immediately.
We will dispatch to harvest team ASAP.
ASAP. ASAP. ASAP. ASAP.
It's a faded poster.
Five new positions available at the mine.
Housing, other provisions are included upon hiring.
First come, first serve.
I keep freaking out at run.
Run.
Robot. It seems to be okay. Just doesn't have power.
Dusty shells. Dusty shells.
It won't turn on.
Mama Zura is doing well. Don't worry about me.
Hope you're all doing well and welcoming those who just came in.
Welcome, welcome.
Self-charging solar battery model.
N87. One year warranty included.
Simply place your self-charging battery in full daylight with the lens facing up.
Charges in seconds. No external powers needed.
Troubleshooting manual.
If the battery fails to charge, check to see if the lens on the front side has been dislodged during transport.
One charge cycle will last about 10 days.
If you notice a decline in the charge cycle within the warranty period, please contact the manufacturer.
This box looks interesting.
I wish I had something to pry it open with.
A robot may not injure a living person, or through an action, allow a person to come to harm.
A robot must obey the orders given to it by people, except where such orders would conflict with the first law.
A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.
The world.
We're in the bare hands.
Then inside is the glen.
And then the refuge.
And then the tower in the center.
How open? Do I have anything?
Oh, a bottle can open it.
Robot without power.
Paper with faded ink.
Able to provide power to all robots and machinery in an area via a large electromagnetic field.
Maintenance efforts are quite high as expected.
We have provided customized backup cells for the few most important robots.
Their electromagnetic fields are much weaker, and the signals are high specific.
Highly supposed to be a good amount.
In other words, these small cells can only charge one single.
Ah.
It's a sort of small machine. I wonder what it does.
I can feel my hair standing up a little.
There's a lot of small goings from swimming in the bottle.
Can I use it?
That's a big machine.
Those seem to be doing anything though.
It's a rectangular shape hole in the middle.
Like something you use to fit in here.
How do you use items?
Hmm.
Don't walk me walk.
Do I have to look for something?
Am I missing something?
I don't know.
It's over here.
I was going to leave it on spooky in here.
A robot sitting on a conveyor belt doesn't seem enough power.
Robot? It seems to be okay. Just enough power.
You imagine equal trips on a pebble,
and the orb shotters would be catastrophic.
Did she get it?
Catastrophic.
Catastrophic.
Catastrophic.
Catastrophic.
A big machine.
Looks to be used to crush metal.
It's barely damaged.
A robot's arm.
A robot's arm.
A robot's arm.
A robot's arm.
A robot's arm.
A robot's arm.
Why would you want to smash a bottle here, Ezra?
The shots could get anywhere.

... so the vent zone, barren workers was still recommended to wear gas masks.
This mask would mandatory around active vent sites of course. As more and more of the workforce got
replaced by robots, we found ourselves with the surplus of abandoned gas masks. It seemed like
like a waste to get rid of them all, so we kept a few for our emergencies.
I don't know where I got our, my brain just inserted the word.
Wait, there's a note over there.
I don't see the note. How do I get that note?
Oh, a middle safe. It seems like it's locked with a six digit code.
I don't remember seeing any six digit codes to use or up.
No, that wasn't it.
This way.
Let me have a six line, six line, six line.
I'm not evil. I'm innocent.
The sun will not return and the abyss is calling my name.
I'm sorry everyone for choosing to leave before the darkness of the case is all.
Yikes.
Oh, this is where I was going to go anyway.
What's up there?
I don't think I should be here.
So we will not go there.
Wait, what's that? Was I there?
Did I go this way?
What's another note?
I turn page with faded inks.
X, X, X, X.
With the mining operation going smoothly,
materials are no longer a limiting factor.
We will be able to build more resilient robots, both in body and mind.
Specifically, the discovery of metal alloy 291 will likely allow the development of highly efficient circuitry.
Cool.
Are these just rocks?
Can I like jump?
It's okay to be scared of the dark. Don't worry.
It's a robot.
A robot with no power, just like the rest.
It's a house.
Oh, the light bulb.
So are you the Messiah?
That's what I've been told.
I expected someone taller.
Vrulda? Vrulda?
I can get big for you, alright?
I'll get nice and big.
Or at least someone that doesn't look like a kitten.
Leave me alone, you bully.
Leave me alone.
He's still growing.
Love you guys on mine, I'm gonna eat a snack.
And that's what you are, right?
Some sort of cat.
Vrulda?
No.
I'm a person.
That's right, you tell him, Niko.
You're a person.
You got the eyes of a cat.
But cats walk on four legs.
Well, either way.
A child like you being the Messiah just doesn't feel right.
But that robot back there said there's no mistake.
I know.
This is going to be, this is going to sound cold, but
I honestly think you're better off just leaving
and letting the world die naturally.
Wow, no.
What a downer, man, mama.
You go party, Popar.
The world has its bones.
Wow, I don't know what happened.
But English just decided not to work with me.
The world has been falling apart for a long time.
This manner of decay is highly unprobable.
Probable that the sun can fix it.
It doesn't hurt to try.
Jesus.
You've already seen how bad it can get, right?
They haven't seen much of anything, actually.
And you can't really just leave.
Oh, so you just got here.
Then you must be headed towards the tower.
Mm-hmm.
It's where I'm supposed to put the light bulb.
Or sun, isn't it?
Yeah, at the very top.
We know that the tower contains a force
that nobody could comprehend.
And the power is strongest at the summit.
Maybe it will send you back home after you complete your mission.
Oh?
Don't take my word for it, though.
This is definitely not Dark Souls.
Mm-hmm.
It went up.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Just leave the world before it's in our time.
Ah, wrong button.
A glass is a bit too foggy to see details, though.
A shelf of weird tools and a piece of metal.
Still silver.
I heard the news about the mines.
I'm sorry, I can't imagine what you're feeling.
It's been two weeks.
I know it must be hard.
But maybe it's better that you come back.
It's only a matter of time before the roll.
Robots.
That's right. Robots.
What a cute misspell.
Are we called?
At least let me know you got my message, okay?
Kip.
Something is poking out of the shelf.
Ah, the screwdriver.
You can take it if you want.
It may help you.
Oh, are you sure?
Yes, I have many.
Thank you.
A shelf of weird tools and a piece of metal.
Please don't touch that.
Oh, sorry, I got curious.
What is this thing?
Back-up power cell.
It keeps me functional.
The main generator for the barons ran out of power some time ago.
It could not even last a week without the sun.
Sorry to hear that.
All we can do is make use of the light we have.
It's a metal chess table covered in dust.
I have, oh my god.
Water time. Water break.
Oh.
Having a swollen esophagus really sucks.
I haven't played chess with anyone else for a very long time.
Ahem.
Oh?
Not even with the other robots?
No.
Nobody in the barons have that capacity in their programming.
Nobody here is tamed for that matter.
What is tamed? I remember.
Talk to me.
What's inside the tower?
I don't know. Nobody's ever entered it before.
At least nobody.
Nobody history knows.
Nobody history knows.
Nobody history knows.
Nobody history knows.
Nobody history knows.
Moving on.
Then who built it?
Built?
As far as anyone can tell, it's been there since the beginning of time.
I know someone who wanted to study it before, but...
Oh?
He never told me if it went anywhere.
Do you need further assistance?
We're good, thanks.
Huh?
Hmm.
I don't know.
Am I supposed to be this way?
Wait.
I saw you heading towards this direction.
The Mayans have been abandoned for a long time.
I can't not guarantee that it's safe.
If you must enter it, it's my duty to accompany you at least.
Oh, thanks.
They're so fast.
It's cool.
Do be careful in here.
There's a little gadget on the ground.
Looks kinda like a camera.
But it's left of a camera anyway.
Probably even part of a robot at one point.
Oh? Or not? I don't know.
Can I go this way?
I see a faint yellow glow in the distance.
I'll stand so close to the edge.
Sorry.
Looks like even the entrance tunnel collapsed.
Without a vehicle, we can't foresee it.
Can we walk? I can.
But for you, it's a safety violation.
I won't allow it.
What's ahead anyway?
It's a huge network of underground lines that source
a source of this world's metal and non-phosphor fuel.
This is what propelled the world into industrial age.
So now it's lost forever.
It's been for a while now.
When the sun went out, the mines were the first to be abandoned
and missed initial panic.
Even the robots have been all cleared out and repurposed.
That makes sense.
It's like how you can say history, forgot someone,
an event if the records of it are lost.
Oh!
I've never heard anyone say it like that before,
so it's good to know now.
Those are definitely words.
Yeah.
No, there was one that always insist on going back.
No?
I'll be okay.
You know, when you read a word or a sentence or something
and it just doesn't sound right, no matter how you say it,
or like when you spell out a word and you're spelling it correctly,
but it just doesn't look right.
It's like you finally looked at the word and actually looked at it
and it still doesn't look right.
That's what that felt like right then and there.
They have kind of uncanny valley of grammar.
I think that's it.
Oh, there's anything else in here.
We'll leave.
Ready to leave?
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
All right.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Oh yeah, I forgot I got fast travel.
I was going to walk all the way back.
How do you fast travel again?
Which one is it?
I don't remember.
Aha!
It was good.
Are you the one?
Wait.
You have this screwdriver.
I can open up the box.
Hello again.
Are there more questions you wish to ask?
No.
It's all right. Thank you.
I'm not kidding. I wish you safe travels.
The screwdriver is not nearly big enough to pry it open.
Come on.
Come on. It's open.
I'm feeling I'm missing something.
What would you need the screwdriver for?
I forgot I can run as well.
I'm slow walking.
What if my scarf got caught in there
and then it'll pull me in
and not going to finish that sentence?
That's the...
That's a horrible thought.
A big machine.
What do you use the machine for?
What can I use the screwdriver for?
I'm not forgetting something.
Am I forgetting something?
I feel I am forgetting something.
Is there anything in here?
Anything up here?
I don't know.
What is this?
A metal pipe.
It must have broken out from one of these terminals.
It's not bad.
I'm a little tired from walking.
It's all right if I take a nap.
It's all right if I take a nap.
It's all right if I take a nap.
It's all right if I take a nap.
It's all right if I take a nap.
It's all right if I take a nap.
It's all right if I take a nap.
It's all right if I take a nap.
Sure.
A little nappy.
Nappy for Nico.
Hello?
L goodbye?
Hello?
Hello?

Did I break the game?

იაიბპ thanking the hope for you, June Owens..!
იიზღუჼიუეჟ the Vomit..
You're so cute!
You're so cute!
Azura, are you still there?
Yes.
I'm awake.
I had a dream just now.
I saw it.
You did?
Wow.
I...
I really thought I was back home.
Oh, the sun back in my home world is in a light bulb.
There's a big ball of fire in the sky.
I don't...
I don't think I would be able to hold it
like I do with the sun for your world.
This isn't my world.
Huh?
This isn't the world I live in.
Really?
I guess not.
If you're the god of this world,
you wouldn't necessarily be in it.
What's your home world called?
Earth.
Earth.
Earth.
Like, the stuff on the ground.
Why is he so cute?
I want to squish him.
I want to squish him.
Squish.
Wait.
Do you live on the ground?
No, silly.
No.
Ah,
neither do we.
Bustros and field mice and stuff too.
Does your world have a sun?
Yes.
It's also a ball of fire.
Really?
Wow.
Can you hold it?
That was a silly question, wasn't it?
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.
No silly question.
Actually, little nickel.
The sun in my home world is very bright.
Warm too.
You saw, right?
But it goes away sometimes at night.
Everything gets dark.
Kind of like how this world is now.
But it's okay because sun always comes back the next day.
That's good, won't you think?
My world is like that too.
Ah.
Do you sleep during the night?
We go to sleep usually.
I sometimes sleep.
I have a hard time sleeping a little bit of insomnia.
So I have to take my medication that usually puts me to sleep.
But sometimes it doesn't work.
And I'll be up for hours before falling asleep around like 6 in the morning.
Sleep is very hard.
That's why I was surprised to have extremely good sleep last night.
I went to sleep pretty early.
It was really good.
I think I was snoring.
I usually do not snore, but I feel like I did.
I woke up drooling.
It was like all over my arm.
I don't have to explain what they are.
Do I?
Did I miss something?
There's a bunch of them in this world.
A bunch of what?
Did I miss something?
Anyway, you should probably get going.
Do you have some shams?
I think I'll sit here.
Oh, computers? You're talking about computers?
Let's see.
There's something in the air here.
It hurts to breathe.
I have a lot.
The pipe won't fit under the cracks.
We need to flatten it.
I know. I know how.
We can flatten it. Let's go flatten it.
Big scary machine.
Do you want me to crush the pipe in here, Azora?
I don't want to get too close.
That was scary.
I was scared for you. Don't worry.
I wouldn't be near this at all.
Good night.
Good night.
Good girl.
We're being here.
Stopping by.
Hello.
9-9.
We're in the way.
Hello.
It's turning my way.
This bus looks interesting.
Wait, I wasn't holding it.
I have a crowbar now.
Wait, did I not click on it?
This bar should open it.
This little mill cube and some broken glass in here
looks like what I used
to be
what used to be a machine bar.
Wow, my English is just so horrendous.
It says solar battery on the side.
You screwed right up the lens out?
Okay.
The lens pops right in.
Broken battery.
Boom, boom, boom.
Let's go.
It's like my hand.
Empty.
We're using the sun directly on the battery?
Yes.
I would have never thought of that.
Good thinking, Azura.
I'm smart.
It looks like it's already fully charged.
That was fast.
Let's hope the charge battery does something.
Oh, my eyes.
It was.
It wasn't even that bright.
Oh, I wasn't sneezing.
Sorry.
I wasn't sneezing.
I didn't sneeze.
I wasn't sneezing.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Ow.
I just got shot.
Oh, you're not getting out of the tube, man.
Shot, not fun.
Robots are right.
I am functional.
Did you power the generator?
I, I guess we did.
Right, Azura?
I am functional.
I can walk.
Congratulations.
I see you.
I see you've made progress in the world, Azura.
Oh, I didn't mean click, click, click.
Oh, no, I don't know what it said.
I believe you need a code to unlock certain bots.
Well, the code no longer exists in this world.
Do you understand what that means, Azura?
Yes.
Good.
Start looking.
All right.
I think
if I remember correctly,
I go here, then here,
browse local files.
Ah,
read me.
No, not here.
Uh,
but,
but,
I don't,
I don't remember.
Oh, no, that's, that's the game, right?
Oh.
What do I do?
I'm scared.
I'm actually frightened.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
What the heck is this?
I,
I don't know.
Oh, I found it.
Oh, no, I exited.
I found it.
I'm smart.
I'm intelligent.
I'm smart.
Where was the box this way, right?
A computer asked me to find some files
to find the password for the box.
It wasn't to me.
Directly to me.
And I think it's for this box right here.
A metal safe.
Seems like it's locked with a 66 code.
I don't remember the code.
Ah, it's an 86 code.
I do, I have it.
Five,
two,
five,
three, zero.
Oh.
Okay, if that wasn't it, then what is it?
Or is it a code for something else?
No.
What?
I'm so confused.
Yeah, this is,
this is what they sent me.
What now?
A code for a box?
A code for a box?
Is one of the zeros an eight?
No.
That's a, it's definitely a zero.
It's definitely, definitely a zero.
Um.
Yes?
Oh, no.
Wait, wait.
I wasn't paying attention.
Can I ask him that again?
Is it the same?
So empty here is why it's called a baron.
Are there any people living in this area besides robots?
I mean, I don't know.
I was not built to wander,
not built to,
so you just stand here and speak boring.
Do you at least have friends,
robot friends?
I cannot desire companionship.
I have not been tamed.
Not tamed?
There was no time.
I see.
Close the other questions.
Prophecy?
What is this prophecy exactly?
The prophet predicted that a savior
will arrive from another land.
The savior will wake up in a strange house,
find the sun, and illuminate the world.
So, what else did you foresee?
What do you mean?
What else did you see in the prophecy?
Wait.
You are a prophet, right?
Good heavens, no.
We called it my prophecy earlier.
That just means it is built into my programming.
You are what?
Ah, my programming is what guides me.
I am a robot after all.
I see.
Another question.
Tower?
How tall is the tower?
I can't seem to even see the top.
I'm not allowed to answer.
But how do I get up there?
In time, as we all know what to do,
I see.
Is that it?
Yeah, what do I do?
Zora?
I am not going to smash this book.
Just let me smash it.
Let me smash.
Let me smash, please.
Let me smash.
What do I do?
What am I...
I'm functional.
I have fast travel, I forgot again.
How do I...
I have fast travel, I forgot again.
How do I...
Is this it?
Hello, small person.
You are not much better than me.
Welcome to the lookout point.
Below us is the old quarry.
The head engineer lives a little more to the east.
Never eat soggy waffles.
The entrance to the old mine is further to the east.
I see.
They take me there.
I can't open that box for some reason.
You need further suits for a good thing.
What do I do?
Oh, safety violation.

I should be fine with this mask on.
Is that I want to do it like me?
Can't help but look at everything.
Hello person, welcome to the old chemical processing plant.
Most of the equipments have already been relocated.
The door is ported out. The door seems loose though.
I would be able to pull it off with the right tool.
I, I have a tool. I can do that
with my trusty screwdriver to think of this
Screwdriver? I mean crowbar.
Hello workout.
This is a pair of rubber gloves.
I'll be heavy.
Is that a robot?
Hello person, the robot assembly and repair services have been discontinued at the parent.
If you have further inquiry, please contact the head of engineer.
It seems to be a page or set of a book.
Cannot overstate
the importance of cleaning solvents in the environment.
Here is a simple recipe using the alternative method discussed in the last chapter.
Utilizing the natural properties of blue phosphor.
Re, reagent? reagents?
Oh no, go back.
Instructions. I didn't see it. Dang.
I know well, ventilated.
Oops, cut.
Come on, let me read it.
I set a gas blue phosphor, rare form.
Instructions.
It's like my brain automatically presses the space bar.
I don't want to press the space bar.
I want in a well-ventilated area, directed the gas into your container of choice.
See you immediately.
Why is there bread?
My chest?
It comes from abroad.
That's why.
It comes from abroad.
I really like bread.
That's why.
And I think YouTube likes it too.
YouTube is in love with bread.
So I gave YouTube bread.
Want to robot without power?
I guess the generator can only do so much.
It's a big metal box, complicated machinery inside.
Kind of looks rusty.
It seems to be a payer tripped out of a box.
Without breaking the seal, inject the liquid phosphor into the container.
Shake vigorously to initiate the reaction.
Use as soon as possible.
If elements begin to separate, further shaking is required.
Also note, hand protection is critical after this step.
The resulting acid is moderately stronger than common household cleaners.
I don't know what the half of these words mean.
It's a good thing you're here, Azura.
Oh yeah, I'm smart.
Mm-hmm.
I know everything.
I got you, I got you, Miko.
A cleaning sponge with a rough surface.
Anything further up here?
It's a gas vent.
There's something weird about the robots who get sent to work near the gas field.
They appear to accumulate rust at a much slower rate than the others.
The few who work directly with gas harvesting looks practically new.
Is that a result of the atmosphere, fear, or am I just seeing things?
I just came from there.
Anything else?
I'm just like exploring everything, making sure I've seen it all, you know?
It's a giant robot. I'm scared.
Oh, hello. What are you doing here?
A living person such as yourself should have evacuated this place long ago.
But I just got here to this world of you. See? I have a son.
Oh, the Messiah. I do not know what to say.
Greetings. You were not part of my programming. Have you spoken to the Prophet Bot?
I think so, yeah. Prophet Bot was built with the sole purpose of greeting you.
Really? Yes, you cannot speak with anyone else.
At least not with ease. Oh, that's kind of sad. Indeed it is.
What are you built for then? My purpose is to guard this settlement.
Even though the residents have long gone, I must remain.
Uh, why though? I have not been damned. Damned?
It was not worth the effort. Worth the effort.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Ah, reporting for duty. I saw that you spoke with the guardian of this element.
I will not escort you until you reach your dormitory.
Um, what?
It's not very good at following me.
Are you just going to follow me? Yes.
Until you safely reach a building of your destination.
Okay, we'll go in here.
Looks like they're evacuating a few tamed robots we have here.
It's gonna take Nico out.
Hello.
Makes sense. No point in keeping them in the barrens if all the people are already gone.
I wonder if the engineer is going to...
Apparently phase one of the evacuation ended prematurely.
The big ships started malfunctioning only after a few round trips.
They said it was due to something with squares.
I'm not sure what they mean by that.
Bummer. Looks like they won't be able to transport most of these surplus bots to the city at this rate.
And we worked so hard on those.
I suppose the robots are busy enough with the transporting people as is.
I think it's going to be our turn soon.
It's a parcel, I think. There's writing on this one too.
It says Guardian of Residential Area.
I'm scared of ladders.
Hmm.
Some of the ink in this page is faded.
Likely due to some sort of electrical and magnetic interference.
I'm afraid this operation can no longer be sustained.
If the servers continue to fail, so much that maintenance cannot keep up the pace.
Fortunately it does not seem to be happening to the robots.
At least not at a significant rate. Time to tell.
All of these terminals are not good. I'm not sure what to do now.
Check it. Check it. Terminals does not respond. This is a problem.
You can't catch me.
I remember being taught in school how the water is surrounding the forest,
stretched until the boundaries.
Boundaries. The word just does not look right here.
I don't know why. It just doesn't look right.
Boundaries of space.
But at some point, the fifth prehistoric oceans resend.
Forming what is now the parents. I wonder where all that water went.
A picture of a robot.
A picture of a robot.
You know, I've never been around so many robots before, Azora.
Or any robots at all. I mean, I've seen them in cartoons and stuff.
But I've never seen one in person. They're pretty neat. They're pretty neat.
Don't you think?
I need to go do a robot voice.
What? Did I talk like a robot?
Be boop. Be boop.
Be boop. I'm a robot. Be boop.
I'm a robot and I eat batteries instead of normal people food.
He's so cute.
That is not Greg.
Robots do not consume batteries in the same way people consume food.
In fact, robots do not possess digestive systems. Some robots do not even have mouths.
Azora.
I'm sorry, Nika. I'm so sorry.
You made me look sorry.
I'm so cute.
I'm sorry, Nika.
Hello. Hi. What are you doing up there?
I'm stationed here by yourself. Yes.
Azora? Yeah, nothing else to say?
Is that it? Alright. It's cool.
Hello, organic person who is alive.
An infirmary is a bad infirmary.
Reporting for duty, it seems that you already have an assigned escort.
Would you like me to leave? You can follow me if you want.
Understood. I will now escort you until you reach your dormitory.
Doctor. Hello, person of organic makeup.
Welcome to the infirmary. Scanning for injuries?
Scan complete. Ender is detected? None. Treatment required? None. You're good to go.
Thanks.
What's this? The box of medical clothes?
Most of them are broken or rested beyond you, but this plastic syringe seems to be okay.
Cool. Hello, person.
Are you seeking admission to the infirmary? No?
Oh. Carry on then.
Anyone up there?
Anyone up here? No one up there?
Hey.
Was I in this building already? 118? I was.
It's in this one.
Hey sweetie. Six more weeks until you can come home. About time, huh?
Gosh. I can't imagine living in that awful capsule wall.
Dorm. Thing. But guess what?
Soon you'll get to sleep in a real bed and eat real food again. Right back soon. Love, mom.
Looks like we're supposed to pack stuff for the evacuation starting today. I wish these books weren't so heavy.
It's gonna be a pain to carry them onto the ship, but there by the author, I can't just throw them away.
Anyone up here? No.
Anyone up here? No.
Let's go bowling.
Are you guys not supposed to go into buildings? Correct. We are built for outdoor use only.
And during buildings is not part of our programming. That's strange. Excuse me.
Is this evacuation? As such short notice, I can't believe this. First the sun dies, and now I'm out of a job.
Some sort of medical, mechanical drying.
A robot beyond repair.
We are a cat person because that is what the prophet told. We have no choice.
Honestly, I shall accept your fate.
Nothing down here.
It's a lot over here.
Am I forgetting something? Am I supposed to do something over here?
This vent is on the ground. All the others are taller than me.
Are these syringe?
The vent is on the ground. No, not syringe.
A bottle? I guess you want to fill the bottle with the gas, Sarah? Yeah. I don't want to do it.
Initially the amount of noxious fumes emitted by the natural gas vents caught our team of guard.
Thank goodness the medical team reacted as quickly as they did.
Despite its failure, that the first expedition did bring up some interesting observations about the parents, we found that there is not one but two such vent songs.
With fumes being pumped out at such high concentrations, it seems a miracle that the gas hasn't spread anywhere else.
Our biologists concluded that the phosphorus wrench.
Phosphor shrimp and the creator pools were actively consuming the gas. The shrimp in the ocean also prevent the gas from laughting off into the cleans.
If that's the case, then we owe a lot to these little guys.
What's that?
Hello? Can we go back now?
E, what's over there?
Was I here already? I feel like I was.
I guess not. What the heck is that?
Anything else over here? A robot.
Sky's dark. That it is. Do you know when the sun will be back up? We're working on it.
What is this?
Pond sure looks different, but it looks like jelly. It's formed a bubble over the surface of the pond.
Is that what this is for?
So, fulfilling all the syringes are, I guess it's kind of like a funnel, but the liquid might be a bit too thick to fit in the needle.
Hey, it actually went in. Gross.
So, should I inject the liquid through the cork, right, Azora? Yeah, it's like I'm a doctor.
Oh, I should probably shake this too.
Change color.
A bottle of acid.
It reminds you of that food segment of ASMR.
A cookie eating.
Where is he?
It's a robot.
That's a place right there.
A mirror hanging there.
A bottle of acid.
A sponge. I guess you want me to pour this acid into a sponge?
Because I have these gloves.
I hope this works.
Oh, it's a sponge.
Alright, I'll still have no other choice.
What a funny robot.
There. How's that?
I can move again. Thank you.
Little heart.
I'm able to fulfill my purpose again.
Where would you like to go?
Can you take me to the tower?
Calculating.
Of course, the destination to the tower is the Glen Port.
My build and navigation circuits are fried.
I'm gonna assume that's not good.
But it's not good at all.
Once again, I cannot follow my programming.
Is there anything I can do to help?
If I end up in here, I should speak to the head engineer.
She will know what to do.
I'm assuming that redhead lady or redhead person.
Redhead man?
Redhead man. Redhead person.
Red, redhead.
Fast, fast, fast travel.
You're right.
I forgot.
I forgot.
Excuse me again, Miss.
Miss.
Good-bye, lady.
I found a robot who can take me towards the tower.
But, maverick's in trouble.
Well, tell me to talk to you.
Alright, what is the issue?
Is there something about navigation circuits being fried?
Just the navigation circuit?
Apparently.
Sir and I fixed everything else, I think.
I have something that may help.
Robots.
Robots.
Robo, robo.
How the ability to trace material from their source locations.
Have you let the robot borrow this,
and this backup tracking system should activate?
Ah.
That's a very pretty necklace.
What's it made of?
amber
found from the glen
what's the thing inside the amber
black clover
that's a common plant in our world
it's also
I'm not sure if I can bear the part with this
my programming says yes
but I still feel complicated
a robot that feels
feelings
you need to finish your mission
more than I need to keep saying
here
thank you
what a cute jingle
before I go
is there anything I can do in return
actually
you know how to play chess
yeah
well, Florida
I played it with some older kids before
then will you play a game with me
I mean
I don't know the rules very well
but I guess it's the least I can do
really good at this
thank you
it was built into my code
ah
so
what's it like being a robot and all
I've talked to other robots
and
they all say something about programming
and code and stuff
even you did just now
it's a little hard to understand sometimes
I know
I know
most of the robots here are
not tamed
tamed
watch out
here goes my bishop
taming
it's complicated
oh
how complicated exactly
there goes my other bishop
niko ma go da chas
I mean
neither
I'm horrible at it
I'm good at checkers
is that count
I like checkers
I can't really explain
what tamed robots are
but
I'm one of them
all the other tamed robots
move to other regions
exactly where
I don't know
oh
there goes my little horse
knight
right
wow
a feeling robot
my dream
wow
I have to go now
I have a good dream
thank you and have a good day
or night
hope to see you soon
checkers are fun too
it is
very fun
I like checkers
just as hard
my memory
it's very bad
so I can't really remember rules
easy
oh
have you ever been to any other regions
I heard that there's two more
in the past
yes
I have the data
the coordinates
the coordinates
the memories
I don't know how much of that still holds true
the world
the world may be very different
place now
the sun is gone
no
I said this already, didn't I
the sun probably won't save the world
the decaying started back
before the sun went out
the sun's sudden death
was just the tipping point
and things went south really fast
after that
oh
then there's nothing I can do
check
what?
the only thing you can do
is complete your
pilgrimage
in a way
you're only supposed to be a second chance for the people
just like how the barons
was only supposed to be a second chance for me
there's no guarantee
that things will work out
but
checkmate
alright
guess I've kept you long enough
thank you for listening
I hope
you get home safely
thank you also
am I gonna be able to go
off you go
there's no reason for you to linger in the barons
am I able to go
to this right side of this area
will they take me
or is that a no
safety violation
take me I want to go
I want to see
will I ever be able to go over there
sorry
excuse me for yawning
I have an asterisk
me too
wait I can just
best travel
I'm sorry again
old factory
hundreds
or wait
can I go
box
nice
there he is
what
have you talked to the head engineer yet
he lives in the main mine entrance
I would have given up on
what
I did
that's not what I meant to do
oh this is amber
from the glen
I can remember now
activating tracking system
setting course
wait
this boat
is over capacity
you'll need to leave behind
some of your possession
oh well
I don't think I'll be needing this crowbar anymore
for this gas mag
this is acceptable
onwards we go
I don't know
row row row
your boat down lay down
a stream
merrily merrily merrily
life is but a dream
so cute
oh shit
here's your stop
the glen
wow
thank you
you should be a village to the north
that's all I can recall
that's good to know
farewell
may your mission be a success
are you leaving
yes I must return to my station
but you'll be all alone again
it's okay
I have not been tamed
I think
water
oh
there's two doors
was there anything else over there
was that they scared me
they're running in a circle
I think
I think
I think we'll call it
for today
for one shot
I will play the rest tomorrow
yeah
since we're in a new place now
I think they said when we leave
it automatically saves yes
I think
yeah
you should auto save
excellent
that's good
we can sit and chat for a little bit
before I go
we don't have to leave right away
we can chat for a little bit
but
we'll stop the game here
right now
this action will record your progress in this world
to return to this world again
we need to relaunch
the app
we'll see it
yes
excellent
yeah
yes let's chat
that was fun
so far
a lot of things I don't remember
while playing
the game
make me bugger
bugger
I have to take my medication
medication time
go
you saw nothing
you saw nothing
are you
are you fine
where are they
how are you feeling
I'm feeling alright
just a little bit yippie
a tiny bit
I'm very happy
and relaxed
so far though
so yeah
bro
bro
do we have a patreon scheduled
I am actually
not really sure when
the stuff does get released
or I was probably told
and I forgot
so I can't really tell you
so if you want to know that
information
I can't give that to you right now
yeah
if it's for
per month
per month
shouldn't it be every saturday
possibly
possibly but I'm not sure
I am actually not sure
I can't help but still whisper
I don't have to
but
as it feels
like a habit
where I need to whisper
but I lie
bro
oh man
it's alright
one step at a time
don't worry things will come
into play this time guys
so don't worry
or anything will be fine
bigger
bigger
bigger
bigger
I can't stop
I can't stop
I can't stop
I'm used to whispering
being your natural voice
I don't naturally
I don't normally whisper
but
it just comes
let me
say bye
ok
sorry it's really hard to swallow
because of my esophagus
being swollen
so taking my
medication sometimes hurts
a little bit
I don't have
I'm just vibing
right now
so how has everyone been
I hope you all had
a good day
and if not good I hope
I made it a little better
I hope we made it a little better
maybe
let me wake up to work tomorrow good night
thanks for this dream have a good night
and good luck with work tomorrow
enjoy your 2 grade

so so not today
i don't think youtube wants to see that right now
no
i'm gonna show you my toes
they're my toes
but
oh yeah
you guys saw nothing
saw nothing
good thing i'm so bad at everything
yeah stuff you don't need but would like to have yes
i just add random stuff to the
the list i have a mini fridge in my my my my room uh because uh i need to store some of my medication in a fridge
and it's better to have it close behind so i have some water and some drinks that i can get to really fast
in the mini fridge
but i've had this mini fridge for so long that it mount my functions every now and then
so i added that to the throw list i just added whatever i already kind of have but i know it's broken or whatever
so i'm like hi i guess i can add this all right it's whatever here you go put that there
i didn't want to have the the thrown empty so i added random stuff
so
we need a code word for it is more
uh
uh to my little bit of stretching sorry my arm is really hurt
oh okay uh oh my arms oh my gosh
for free
for free
um
exquisite jewelry you have there thank you like my gems
no i just saw someone do something way worse with asr
in the title and they're fine
i don't know what's up with the bias i have no clue either but it's fine i don't mind it i have no complaints
i just like being given the chance to stream overhaul for you guys
if youtube uh wants to come after us then it's fine that is what it is
yes
yeah i think it's a fruitless battle to try and fight it
but if uh stroney and everyone wants to fight it i will be there by their side regardless of it all
fighting
uh
uh
snuggle time it was called word snuggle time fitness snuggle time fitness sounds
funny snuggle time fitness
maybe it's because they're live streams probably most likely
to be honest i think i got hit mid of that stream like in the middle of it because um
in the middle of the stream
uh no one could search me up for some reason uh some of my
gen mates up but i don't know who knows but possibly
thankfully the archivists are very reliable so you won't lose any of it and i appreciate them
thank you so much for those who archive the the god
um i don't think we're able to um
i can't i don't know how to archive stuff so it's out of my knowledge
i am not advanced in that technique
technology and technicality however you say it
i do know how to uh download it but unfortunately if a video gets taken down you can't
download it i i already tried it won't let you video is gone completely if a video gets taken down
you cannot download it um well
where
time to find a way to get Johnny to own youtube
you gotta make her rich and then she can pay it by a
no it's gonna cost like a trillion billion dollars or something
um
no matter what youtube does i'll still be here by a mama's side
hey thank you appreciate it thank you thank you
no totally happens a lot to be a lower girl yeah
me either thankfully someone else archived it yep i'm also thankful for that too
yes the option though doesn't always the option to record and stream i would have to remember to click the button
it doesn't just ask you to do both uh
and i don't really have the memory to always press that button i wanted to record it
yesterday i'm fully aware that i can record it but that um uh i cannot help
if i don't remember so i'm really sorry about that
it's not in my programming
i just leave the archiving to your bleeding heart thank you i appreciate that
i could be uh cpu intensive depending on your pc
probably most likely yes um i think it will be fine for me but not too sure
won't know until i do it right
if you leave all of us as mama don't worry you're adorable go help me thank you
i'm not adorable you are you're all adorable
are we able to find the archived ones so far uh for me uh i did post one of uh
