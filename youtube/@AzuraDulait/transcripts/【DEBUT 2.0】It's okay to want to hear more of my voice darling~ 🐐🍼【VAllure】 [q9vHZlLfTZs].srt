1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

6
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,040
Hi

7
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Hi

8
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,320
Hi

9
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,880
Can you hear me? Can you hear me, okay?

10
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,920
My mic's not being like extremely bad this time

11
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,880
Not so good. I'm so happy

12
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,880
B&U kinda loud, I heard that I got you

13
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What's up? Welcome in everyone from from M.A.S.

14
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
M.A.S. Dream. Have you all enjoyed M.A.S. Dream?

15
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Hello hello

16
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can do louder

17
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay

18
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yay! Am I right? Am I right?

19
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hi, welcome in everyone

20
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And it was Nia's

21
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What are you guys there for?

22
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Stronius and Shavius and IcyStream too?

23
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I hope you are

24
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Thank you

25
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
My mic sounds better now, yay!

26
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm so happy, I'm glad

27
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I made a mistake

28
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It was like a big mistake last time

29
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm so sorry

30
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I swear to you, I was checking

31
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
All my audio

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I was checking my audio yesterday before that

33
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The day before that

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And just before I went live

35
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And then all of a sudden

36
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It was bad, it was so bad

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I was so loud

38
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Beating in your ear

39
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm so happy, it sounds so much better

40
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Music is loud, my queen

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What? I just turned it down

42
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay, I got you, I'll turn it down some more

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Cheers

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Is that good?

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Is it better?

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I pray

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Power of God

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Good, good

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And

50
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I know it's impossible to stream without scuff

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It happens, it comes

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It comes and it goes

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You have another choice

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What to do?

55
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Get through it

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's like the voice

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm mercy

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm mercy

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm chibi

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm mercy chibi

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm so like

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
My throat is so dry

63
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I feel sick

64
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's cold

65
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's nice and cold

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Much better

67
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
My throat is almost better

68
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah, I'm hydrating with milk

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Nice fresh milk

70
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah

71
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I wouldn't be surprised

72
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
if there are some of you already falling asleep

73
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If you find my voice super

74
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You know

75
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Relaxing to that point

76
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
of falling asleep

77
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I understand

78
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Come closer to the mic

79
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Actually, I think I'll turn it up a little bit

80
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Cause I did turn it down

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
quite a bit

82
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So scared that I'd be too loud

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Hang on, whoop, I made a mistake

84
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Uh

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Is this better?

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let me know

87
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is this good?

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Can you hear me?

89
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Sounds good

90
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes

91
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Good audio?

92
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Sounds good

93
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Better

94
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I heard solution

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Silly

96
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I love this

97
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
There we go

98
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What, alright

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We'll get this down

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We'll get this down

101
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Trust, we'll get this down

102
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And we won't have to worry about this cup anymore

103
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Well

104
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Here's eventually

105
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Are you nervous?

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Me?

107
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Maybe

108
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Maybe

109
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Maybe a little bit

110
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Maybe a little bit

111
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm a little nervous

112
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm a big brave

113
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm a big brave woman, alright

114
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
A lot of big brave women

115
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Alright, okay

116
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I was just setting everything up

117
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And I thought we'd just, you know, relax

118
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And chill and talk about

119
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The day veiled in some of my interests

120
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And stuff that

121
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I went over

122
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I didn't really get to list everything

123
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That I had on there

124
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Sadly, because I thought that

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It would just be better just to list like ten things

126
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Five things

127
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And not like crowded with so much stuff

128
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So

129
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I had

130
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Just a few things

131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And I do want to go over some of the entrusts

132
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Especially anime choices

133
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And some really big game choices

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And stuff, and some more stuff I want to talk about

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So if you guys have any questions for me

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'll be happy to

137
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Go over some questions that you have for me

138
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I also want to go over some morals

139
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And talk about

140
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Some things that just came out

141
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Today

142
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yay

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Blessed with the legendary voice

144
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I heard a lot of people tell me that

145
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
She can't keep up that voice

146
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's impossible

147
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I want to say that this is

148
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is actually my voice

149
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So I don't know

150
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I have quite a range

151
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
In my voice

152
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So I can change the voice

153
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But this is my natural voice

154
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So yeah

155
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Can you do impressions too?

156
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
There is one impression that I think I can't do

157
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But I don't want to

158
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Because I don't have confidence in it

159
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But I used to do a really good Cartman voice

160
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
For self perk

161
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I can't hear it

162
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm like so nervous

163
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm kind of messing up with a bunch of it

164
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm so scared

165
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's that

166
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's the Cartman voice

167
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's the Cartman voice

168
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's the Cartman voice

169
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's the Cartman voice

170
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's the Cartman voice

171
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's that

172
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's the Cartman voice

173
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And the goofy voice that I can do

174
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's like the only impressions that I ever did

175
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
When I get really excited or bored

176
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Or having fun or playing games and stuff

177
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll probably do them randomly out of the blue

178
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's like a... how do you call it?

179
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Stimulize? Stimulation?

180
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
People do random sounds and noises

181
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Every now and then

182
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You'll probably hear me do it out of the blue

183
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Cartman voice line and goofy teaser please

184
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes gamer, I get my girl

185
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
This is true

186
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Cartman ASMR win

187
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh my god

188
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That's hilarious

189
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That sounds like fun

190
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I get me and ASMR, I would love to do that

191
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I probably wouldn't be able to get through it

192
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'd laugh the entire time

193
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I wouldn't be able to stop laughing

194
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I can't even imagine doing a goofy ASMR

195
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh god, that sounds amazing

196
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That sounds so awesome

197
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You?

198
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I can't do it

199
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I can't do it

200
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
My body just won't let me

201
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I can't do it

202
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh my god

203
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Oh man, okay

204
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I have like bad like

205
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I have like ADHD right?

206
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I would weekend end up sitting here talking for like

207
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
For hours

208
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And I'd forget everything else that I'm supposed to be doing

209
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So let's make sure we stay on track

210
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Okay

211
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Chatting is the best thing

212
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It is, I enjoy it a lot

213
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I still want to get through a lot of stuff

214
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't want to get too distracted

215
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But I do like talking to you guys a lot

216
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Like seeing what you guys have to say

217
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And your questions

218
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And you guys get to know me as me

219
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I am still Azura, but yeah

220
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Professional Yapper, yeah

221
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Totally professional

222
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm sorry I needed more water

223
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You know when you talk a lot

224
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You gotta drink a lot of water

225
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
A lot, a lot, a lot of water

226
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Don't stop water

227
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Okay

228
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I want you to do this

229
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And

230
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Okay, hang on

231
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Plop, plop, plop, plop, plop, plop, plop

232
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What do I click?

233
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Where are we?

234
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I still just see him

235
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I did it

236
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I figured it out

237
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh no, that's not supposed to be on screen yet

238
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Oh no

239
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh no

240
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That's fine, that's pretend

241
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That everything is fine

242
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Everything is perfectly fine

243
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Just like this

244
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
This is how it's supposed to have been

245
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Just like this

246
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It was like this from the start

247
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Ever from the start

248
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That's right, you saw nothing

249
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You saw nothing

250
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Only mommy

251
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Only me, you only saw me

252
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No one else

253
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Nothing else

254
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Okay

255
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Alright

256
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm on it

257
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I worried so like

258
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I was like

259
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
When I set up these slides

260
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I swear

261
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I thought it was super fun

262
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I was looking up these collars

263
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
To look like a little milk

264
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Like animation

265
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I wanted this little animation to be like

266
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Milk

267
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So I didn't know

268
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
How to like

269
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Do it

270
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So I did the little waves

271
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And I like searched it up

272
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Like how to do the waves

273
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm not really good with the technical stuff

274
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
When it comes to these kind of things

275
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But I really don't

276
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I really do like looking into it

277
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And so I was like

278
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I want milk

279
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I want it to be on the background

280
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So I thought it was like really cool

281
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Okay

282
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So I thought that was Zura

283
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I just wanted to add that

284
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So I did want to go over

285
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
My interest

286
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
My interest

287
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And I mentioned

288
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That I watch a lot of anime

289
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
But

290
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
When I said a lot of anime

291
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And I said a thousand anime

292
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I really meant it

293
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Like I've actually

294
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
When I was younger

295
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I used to

296
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Make a list

297
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Like I would

298
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I had a book

299
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I still have it

300
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I had a book

301
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Like a notebook

302
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Where I wrote down

303
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Every anime I finished

304
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I would write down

305
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Every anime I finished

306
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And I got up to

307
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
A thousand seven hundred

308
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And then I

309
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I just stopped

310
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Writing down anime

311
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
After that

312
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So the threshold

313
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Of how much anime

314
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I've watched in between there

315
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And then and there

316
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Was

317
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Probably in like

318
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Two thousand four hundred now

319
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Does Azul like

320
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Overlord?

321
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yes!

322
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I've watched Overlord

323
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Do I like Re Zero?

324
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yes! I've watched Re Zero

325
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I

326
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Thoughts on

327
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Reincarnation

328
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
To the slime season

329
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm actually

330
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Kind of a little bit

331
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Disappointed

332
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
In the

333
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The new season

334
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Because

335
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It was like

336
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
They spent like

337
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Six episodes

338
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm over exaggerating

339
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
They spent so many episodes just talking

340
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Talking

341
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Talking

342
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Talking

343
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And I'm up to date

344
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So you have to wait a week

345
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
For the next episode

346
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Only for them to

347
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Talk more

348
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Talk more

349
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Talk more

350
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Then they're like

351
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh there's going to be a fight

352
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
In the next episode

353
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
More talking

354
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
More talking

355
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
More talking

356
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
They spent

357
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Those episodes

358
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Literally at the same table

359
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The same table

360
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The same scene

361
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
All they did was switch seats

362
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
All they did was switch seats

363
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And then when the

364
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Big scene came

365
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I won't spoil it

366
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
For anyone who's watching

367
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Won't spoil it

368
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Then when the big scene came

369
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The big big major scene

370
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Where you know

371
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The big stuff was going to happen

372
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Literally they

373
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
They like separate it and was like

374
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Yeah let's

375
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Me and you pair up

376
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah how about we go over here

377
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
How about we go over here

378
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Then they don't even show it

379
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
They don't even show the fight

380
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
They don't even show it

381
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
We don't even get to see

382
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Each character fight

383
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Yeah I was disappointed

384
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I was disappointed

385
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Animation's still good

386
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But I was very disappointed

387
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I finally

388
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Kept up

389
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What other animals

390
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yes I've watched TVZ

391
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I've watched the big threes

392
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I've watched the big fives

393
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I've watched all the big ones

394
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Really famous ones

395
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
100%

396
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm a big Naruto fan

397
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I've watched it

398
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
For the whole 15 years

399
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Of Naruto

400
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So I'm a huge Naruto fan

401
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I have all the games

402
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I've had all the games

403
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Someone stole two of my games

404
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But we won't

405
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
We'll talk about that

406
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I am not a fan of

407
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Naruto

408
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm sorry

409
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I know a lot of people like

410
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Naruto

411
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
But I'm not a fan of

412
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Naruto

413
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I don't like

414
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I don't like that child

415
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Though I still watch it

416
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Because I'm still a fan

417
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Of the series itself

418
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I have to watch it

419
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I cannot not watch it

420
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I have to watch it

421
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Naruto made me angry

422
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It's like

423
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I've been with Naruto

424
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
For so long

425
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That I understand

426
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
His pain

427
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
What he had to do

428
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
To get to where he was

429
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And he doesn't understand

430
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
The concept of being a parent

431
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And I understand

432
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Naruto

433
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Needing a parent by him

434
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
But

435
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And I understand he's still a kid

436
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And he can't understand

437
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
This concept

438
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Of what Naruto went through

439
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
But they're hiding it from him

440
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And it made it a little worse

441
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Like just tell the kid

442
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Tell him

443
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Tell him

444
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Tell him what happened

445
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Tell him

446
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So that he could finally understand

447
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And mature

448
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And stop being a brat

449
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It's such a brat

450
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Well of course

451
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
My favorite character

452
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Is Hinata

453
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Sorry

454
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
It's my boo-dang

455
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I love Hinata

456
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's Hinata and Rock Lee

457
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I really like Rock Lee

458
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Like come on

459
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
A character that worked

460
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Really really hard

461
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
To get where he is

462
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And to be

463
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
At the top of where everyone is

464
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Like come on

465
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's Rock Lee

466
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And guys and Zebra

467
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I like them

468
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Oh man

469
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You guys have so much less

470
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Of a

471
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
More anime

472
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
More questions

473
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
But other anime

474
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I'm trying to keep up

475
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm so not used to

476
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
This chat movement so fast

477
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I

478
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Yeah

479
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Rock Lee vs. Gar was the best fight

480
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Whenever

481
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Little

482
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It was a great fight

483
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Hype was crazy

484
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Uncle bad

485
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Get very cute

486
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I like Uncle too

487
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I

488
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Had to raise Zebra

489
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I know you're pissed

490
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I watched so many more anime

491
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I watched Yu Yu Hakusho

492
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I watched all the old old anime

493
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Dang

494
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I watched Inuyasha

495
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I think Inuyasha was like

496
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
What

497
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Like really got me into anime

498
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
A long time ago

499
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Since

500
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Way back when

501
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I used to be a poor poor child

502
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I still am

503
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Didn't have a TV

504
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Didn't have anything

505
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So

506
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
When I went to go visit

507
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Family

508
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I would stay over

509
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And they had a TV

510
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And it would stay on all night

511
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And I would sleep

512
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And watching cartoons

513
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Cartoons

514
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And

515
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
You fall asleep

516
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And in the middle of the night

517
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You know

518
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
The ending would play

519
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And

520
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And it would wake me up

521
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And then I would sit there

522
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And I would watch it

523
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Like

524
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And then I'd end up watching

525
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
You Know Yasha

526
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And then after that

527
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I really got into watching

528
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You Know Yasha

529
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And then I started watching

530
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
More anime

531
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And more

532
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I was watching

533
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
The Big O

534
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Cowboy Bebop

535
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
All of this came on

536
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
On Adult Swem

537
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I was watching all of these

538
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
On the TV

539
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I definitely shouldn't

540
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Have been watching these things

541
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Given how old I was then

542
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But I was watching all of them

543
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I remember

544
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
When I first watched

545
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Caster & Sins

546
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It was a

547
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Thanksgiving day

548
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And

549
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
They turned on the TV

550
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
To keep the

551
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Kitties distracted

552
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And

553
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
They knew I liked anime

554
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
But they didn't know

555
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
What anime was really about

556
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
So they just turned it on

557
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
The TV

558
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And Caster & Sins

559
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Like a marathon was running

560
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And I watched the whole thing

561
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
While I was sitting there

562
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
On the floor

563
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Like

564
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Wah

565
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Wah

566
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That's crazy

567
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It's like a

568
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Whole marathon

569
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Are you watching the new

570
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Spice & Wolf?

571
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
It's on my

572
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
To watch list

573
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I really enjoyed

574
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
The first

575
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Spice & Wolf

576
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
The original

577
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Before they did the remake

578
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I really

579
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I watched the whole thing

580
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And I know the whole song

581
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Seven apples on a

582
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Witch's tree

583
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
With seven seas

584
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
A plant inside of me

585
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And springtime

586
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I sing

587
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
A magic song

588
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Then skipping along

589
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I sing

590
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
A song to everyone

591
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I look at the world

592
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Through

593
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Apple eyes

594
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I cut myself a slice

595
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Of sunshine pie

596
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I know that whole song

597
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So I have it on my

598
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
To watch list

599
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I was waiting

600
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
For all the episodes

601
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
To come out

602
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So it's on my list

603
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
To watch the

604
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
New Spice & Wolf

605
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Any guilty pleasure

606
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Animated

607
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Ease

608
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Like

609
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
An anime that's trash

610
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
But you can't get enough

611
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
None that I could

612
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Think of

613
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I don't think

614
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I could think

615
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Of one right now

616
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I know a

617
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Bunch of anime

618
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That has

619
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Like really bad animation

620
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
But the plot

621
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Is so funny

622
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
So I still like it

623
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Or like

624
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's chaotic

625
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,640
like childish anime that I really like it was an anime that I used to watch when I

626
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,420
was younger called Kadocha Kadocha was like a little girl named like was it

627
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:52,740
Sonako? Sonako? She would sing into this toy.

628
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:06,360
Super old anime so old no one knows of it but it was so funny to me it was

629
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,060
hilarious to me I found it very funny a lot of people would probably watch it

630
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:15,220
now I'd be like what the hell sounds horrible this looks terrible

631
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:31,180
I do like Belle's above 100% it's a good it's a good anime I really love

632
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,900
anime is that um that have delinquents in it I love delinquency

633
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:46,660
delinquency anime is so good I just love their voice

634
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:55,020
I just like the way they talk and the way they yell at each other it's my

635
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,260
favorite so one or there is a delinquent in an anime they're like usually my

636
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:13,420
favorite favorite characters and yes I watched I shield 21 as well I really

637
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:17,700
like sports anime as well so I put blue lock because it was like one of the

638
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:24,300
newest like recent ones that I've watched and I like I like when they're

639
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:29,020
really suspenseful and I think blue lock really hit that like I've been

640
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:34,500
craving a sports anime with really good animation that is really suspenseful for

641
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,740
a while and then with blue lock came out it was like that was that was it that

642
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:45,460
was the one it was really hype it had me really into it and I've watched a

643
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:50,460
haikyo I've watched I've watched and read the manga of Prince of Tennis

644
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:55,500
because I've read the manga first before I watched the anime so I read the manga

645
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:09,420
I read Prince of Tennis I free haikyo I liked haikyo a lot I liked a lot of a

646
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:17,700
lot of the anime is any opinion on the JoJo series I watched the whole JoJo

647
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:32,100
series I've seen the whole thing all of it I love that I just people there's a

648
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:41,780
what's that sumo anime called haji haji haji something sumo I don't know sumo I

649
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:48,140
watch that too I really love the opening of that song a lot it's one of my

650
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:57,060
favorite openings he know he mode he no matter sumo yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

651
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:03,180
yeah yeah the opening is so awesome I love it it's a really good opening I

652
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:10,540
didn't expect it and I think the opening is what really made me continue to watch

653
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:17,900
the anime have you seen our bleach I haven't seen the new bleach stuff that

654
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:25,660
came out because I don't like cliffhangers so I was waiting for a majority of

655
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,380
episodes to come out cuz I like to bench sit down with some ice cream some

656
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:38,580
popcorn turn off my lights good comfy cozy wrapping up like it and then bench

657
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:47,420
big old bench I haven't seen the new bleach yet but I stopped at the the old

658
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:54,020
old bleach I seen the whole season like can you get a big hug yeah you can get a

659
00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:01,460
big hug a big hug there you go yeah hug for a job

660
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:13,980
binging is the best favorite bleach opening oh that's hard that's very hard

661
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,980
because I listened to like a bunch of openings and I think all of them are

662
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:31,060
really good I don't know that one stuck in my head so that one gets easily stuck

663
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:37,980
in my head so probably that one I think it's opening six if I remember correctly

664
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:57,860
yeah I think that's opening sex

665
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:10,620
NASA loans now I'm stuck in my head it gets stuck in my head really like fast

666
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:25,060
do you watch harem anime I do but I am not like a mega big fan of certain harem

667
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:32,220
anime because I'm not a fan of certain MC characters that are like like

668
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:39,060
extremely dumb they make me really mad

669
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:44,700
it makes me super mad with how dense they could be like how can you be so

670
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:53,060
dense how how how are you stop it are you dumb

671
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:59,540
who's right with you she wants you

672
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:15,300
I watched it is only certain harem anime that really catch my attention and I

673
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,500
guess it's I guess it's where the MC sometimes really don't want anything to

674
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:27,780
do with the other girls and they don't get beat up I like where the girls

675
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:33,820
aren't that cliche niche where they like beat up the MC all the time for like

676
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:46,020
small things like really small things like why are you beating him up why why I

677
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:52,620
thought his joke was really funny I thought it was funny I laughed

678
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,260
he didn't do nothing wrong

679
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,420
especially if you really like the character like if she the character

680
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:16,900
right really likes the MC and he happened to see something right and he

681
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:22,420
actually generally felt bad about it why hit him there's no need to hit him

682
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,060
it'll be different if he was like one of those characters to really really really

683
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:41,580
really really poorly what and they did that you know the extreme I would get it

684
00:38:41,580 --> 00:39:00,660
I would get one in you know beat them up all right but so Cassie yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

685
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,640
yeah

686
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:12,820
we're them up deserved

687
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:23,320
guy probably not dense because I keep hitting him in the head

688
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,700
its probably true

689
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:43,020
I've seen Beyblade X. I don't have a big opinion on it actually. I've seen it so long ago

690
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:47,900
that I don't really have it. I can't really give an opinion on like extremely extremely

691
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:54,700
old anime or shows or cartoons because they're really old. That's like asking me what are

692
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:59,900
my opinions on Pokemon and I've watched the entire Pokemon series. I'm a huge Pokemon

693
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:08,500
fan. I've played almost a majority of all Pokemon games. I love Pokemon. Do I have an

694
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:13,260
opinion on the show itself? No. I don't. I don't. I can't give you that. I can't give

695
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:26,660
you that answer. I love Pokemon. That's all that matters. I even have a Digimon plushie

696
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:36,660
sitting up there. But Digimon plushie, Pikachu plushie, a bunch of plushies. I collect quite

697
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:47,620
a lot of them. Oh my god someone mentioned Negima. Oh my god I really loved Negima. I

698
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:55,740
don't know why. But I loved Negima. It gets a pass. A big pass for me. He was an intelligent

699
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:01,260
character. He was really smart. He may be a little bit dense but he was smart. I liked

700
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:13,860
him. I liked Negima. That was good anime. Singles for that Yokai anime. What was it called?

701
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:29,180
It's not really a harem. I wouldn't really call it a harem anime. What was it called?

702
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:39,620
It's like the Yokai anime where he turns into the guy with the really long hair. The white

703
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:58,580
hair that comes out really long in the back. Yeah. Yes! That's the one. That's the one.

704
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:22,500
Oh my god I can't even say that. I can't even say that. I'm gonna butcher it. I can't

705
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:33,740
for that stuff. Look I said I'm still learning Japanese. The big words like that's hard. It

706
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:51,140
is norari. I like that one. That's good. I sure people mentioned some more anime but

707
00:42:51,140 --> 00:43:00,740
I probably missed it. I'm sorry if I missed it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've seen a few

708
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:24,500
other anime. We've been talking about anime for almost literally an hour. Oh no. No tarem.

709
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:38,180
We have the hardest role. Yes I've seen Shaman King. I can tell you my favorite cartoons

710
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:51,180
or anime from Four Kids TV. I watched Yu-Gi-Oh! Pokemon. Spider Writers. I watched Bakugan

711
00:43:51,180 --> 00:44:09,780
and Battle Brawlers. I watched all of them. Everything. I literally went on when I first

712
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:20,940
got my big chunky PC. I was like binging all the shows that I could get my hands on. With

713
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:27,340
the Wicked Rise, The World Girl, Howling Hall, Spider Writers. Spider Writers V2. If you

714
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:33,180
truly want to be V2, it's cool. You can join our team. I know all the songs too.

715
00:44:33,180 --> 00:45:02,620
Oh, I like my favorite song. I like the original Yu-Gi-Oh! But there's not a lot of singing. It's

716
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:13,020
just. But I think Five D's was my favorite. Yu-Gi-Oh! Five D's.

717
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:39,820
Feel the wind is blowing me around. Take a shot at me and run this side by side. It's

718
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:49,180
a blur as I go by. I can't hear you breathing. I can't see you coming. I can't feel the wind

719
00:45:49,180 --> 00:46:01,100
is blowing me around. See the sunrise and fire in the sky. Greatness thrust itself into our lives.

720
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,220
Yeah.

721
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:21,180
I loved Yu-Gi-Oh! Five D's. It was good. And the show called Blue Dragon. Blue Dragon, yeah.

722
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:27,020
It looks like, I think the artist is literally the creator of Dragon Ball Z because they look the

723
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:34,620
same. They look exactly the same. I've watched Detective Conan. Yes, yes, yes. Isn't Detective

724
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:40,380
Conan still ongoing? I've watched like a few seasons but I don't think I've continued to watch it

725
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:45,020
because there was so much. It's like one piece and I'm like also watching one piece as well.

726
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:56,060
It's like the Conan is still kicking.

727
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:07,820
Blue Dragon game was kind of ass. It's true. I agree. But the series was pretty good. And then it

728
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:12,780
just kind of died. I don't know what happened to it. I don't know if it got cancelled or something.

729
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:17,180
It just was gone. The show Akira, I watched that too.

730
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,740
Goddess of Anime and Fertility.

731
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:38,380
Any genre I dislike? Probably Mecha. I'm sorry everyone. I'm sorry. There's only a few Mecha

732
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:47,260
that are in my heart early. But any other Mecha besides Neon Genesis, besides Full Metal Panic,

733
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:50,700
Code Geass. If it's not those animes, I don't like it.

734
00:47:55,660 --> 00:48:02,700
I love Code Geass. I love Full Metal Panic and I love Neon Genesis. And was it, was the other one?

735
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:08,220
There was another Mecha anime that I like but I don't remember the name of.

736
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:17,420
Even Gallant. Yes, yes, yes. I like that too. No worries. No worries there. If it's not those,

737
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:20,620
if it's like those other Mecha anime, I'm not really a big fan.

738
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:31,900
Oh, I love Fuli Kuli. I love Fuli Kuli. Fuli Kuli is awesome. What? It's not even like a big Mecha anime.

739
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:39,580
I like Goren Lagin but I really hate one of the characters.

740
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:47,420
One of the female characters made me angry so she makes me not like the show.

741
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:56,940
Eruka 7? I like Eruka 7. Like I said, there's only a few Mecha anime that win my heart over.

742
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,180
Only a few. Majority of the new ones I don't really like.

743
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:18,940
Yes, I watched Sparx Family. I really like the first season so I haven't really, I started

744
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:26,460
on the next season but I haven't gone up to date so I like watched three episodes of the new season

745
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:33,660
and then I kind of stopped. Their approach on the new season kind of like got me a little bored

746
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:39,500
because they're like individually going at every character, giving each character their own episode.

747
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:45,260
They didn't really do that in the first season so it kind of throws me off a little bit because I don't

748
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:51,980
really like, usually it was a combination of everyone and then focused on Anya and now it's

749
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,300
everyone gets their own special episode and I kind of like don't care.

750
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:06,300
I don't know if that's just me not being able to process it very well but

751
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:12,940
have you seen To Your Internity? To Your Internity is the first anime to ever make me cry

752
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:17,900
in the first episode. The first anime to ever make me cry in the first episode.

753
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:31,900
I love Death Note, of course I do. Oh my god, I love Durarara. I love Durarara as well.

754
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:37,820
We're gonna sit here and talk about anime this entire time. There's so much stuff I wanted to talk about.

755
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:50,140
I'm having fun. This is fun. Talking about anime gives you like really relaxed,

756
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:56,140
really into it and it's like one of my biggest passions because when I'm really sad and feeling

757
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:05,340
down and you know, I want to watch anime. It makes me feel so much better.

758
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:12,060
So I like binged anime like throughout my whole life. Anime is great.

759
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:29,740
Free Wren. Free Wren is, I finished that whole, I think that anime was amazing.

760
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:36,060
There are a lot of hate on Free Wren. There's so much hate on that anime because it's like,

761
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:45,020
it seems boring to the eyes of a lot of people. It doesn't meet the target audience,

762
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:56,300
but I think it's so good. It tackles a whole another view on adventure as a whole.

763
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:04,540
All anime is always focused, fantasy focus is always on the focus of what happens before.

764
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:10,940
They defeat the demon lord, what happens before, everything they have to do and go through and

765
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:19,020
you build this like towards the character in the moment. But imagine being someone who lives

766
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:29,180
for a long time and being surrounded by people who don't and you spent an entire time living

767
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:34,460
up with these people throughout your whole life and then they're gone.

768
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:41,340
And now you have this, now it's like usually, anime would end on that and be like, oh that was the

769
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:46,060
story of how we defeated the demon lord and then we'll never see what happens afterwards. We get

770
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:54,460
to see the after, the memories and still gain a connection to old characters that you don't see

771
00:52:54,460 --> 00:53:00,700
later on and I think that's really awesome. And then the animation is amazing given the fact

772
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:09,580
that it was drawn by hand. Everything was drawn by hand. It is amazing. They did so good for,

773
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:15,740
especially for a studio that was, you know, a lot of their stuff in the past was really bad.

774
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:22,940
They stepped it up. They stepped it up with this anime. Oh sorry, I got really into that one. I'm so sorry.

775
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:38,380
I'm sorry, I got really passionate with that one.

776
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:49,420
Oh yes, I watched Assassination Classroom. I think it's a really good anime as well.

777
00:53:55,180 --> 00:54:16,060
I feel so bad for the the elf though, for Friren. Given the fact that she is, you know,

778
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:21,900
an elf and living for a long time, you don't really process the feelings of how humans process them.

779
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:29,980
So I understand that. I really do understand that of being so out of touch with their own emotion

780
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:40,860
sometimes and not understanding the concept of love and other feelings of, you know, things like

781
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:45,420
that because, you know, when you say I'll see you later for an elf, that could be like, I'll see you

782
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:54,300
later, like a hundred years later, like imagine someone liking you and you're like, and it's

783
00:54:54,300 --> 00:55:03,420
whatever. And then they like, then they're gone and then you're like, well, damn, well, damn.

784
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:09,660
Now you know, you know, you cry, you cry. All you could do is cry and you feel for her like, oh,

785
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:14,700
it took her so long to realize this and understand.

786
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:26,380
Make me cry. I'm really emotional when it comes to watching anime. Anime does not fail to make

787
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:30,620
me cry. If it's like really an emotional part or piece, I will probably cry.

788
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:37,500
Pixel games? Yeah, I like pixel games, like, you know, like One Shot,

789
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:47,260
Stardew Valley, you know, games like that. I like those kind of games, but I didn't really know

790
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:54,140
how to like pinpoint it, like Terraria. I call those pixel games because I don't know what else to

791
00:55:54,140 --> 00:56:00,140
call them though. I call those pixel games. I don't know what else to call them though.

792
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:07,500
Yeah, I like Cal World. I like open world games and building games. I like farming games. I like

793
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:15,820
simulating games. I like games where you just shut your brain off and play. I love it. I do, do, do.

794
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:25,820
Let me do a Monster Hunter stream. I want to, I'm a little nervous too, because it's not a game that I

795
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:34,140
play often, but I have played it a few times and I loved it, but I never found the time to play it

796
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:41,500
again. So I played it a few times, so it became one of my favorite games to play every now and then.

797
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:48,940
Um, do I like the game Dead by Daylight? I have played it once when it was free to play,

798
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:57,660
but I've never actually played it, but I have watched some gameplay because I did like the game

799
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:15,020
itself. It looks fun, but yeah. I really do like One Shot a lot because I think it's super cute.

800
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:25,660
I liked it so much so that I ended up getting a Nico, a Nico plushie. I have a Nico plushie,

801
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:30,460
and the light bulb is like magnet and it like attaches to his hands.

802
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:43,900
That's one of my favorite games. I really like that. So I can't wait to play it again. I'm so

803
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:49,980
excited to play it once more. Yeah, I mean, or for the first time ever. Yeah.

804
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:09,500
I actually added a few games that I haven't played. No, I haven't actually, I'm reading this list.

805
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:19,260
There's only one game I haven't played and that's Little Nightmares. I have the game and I've had

806
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:25,980
the game in my library for a really, really long time, for a really, really, really long time,

807
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:32,460
but I've never played it. So it's been a game that I've been wanting to play for a really long time.

808
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,860
This is there.

809
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:45,260
Yeah, I hear it's short, but I want to play the whole series, Little Nightmares.

810
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:54,300
One, two, and I don't think three is out yet. So that's why I want to play it.

811
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:07,980
All right, fine. Fine. I've been seeing this question a lot. All right. Listen to me. Listen

812
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:14,380
to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Are you guys listening? Are you listening? Are you listening?

813
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:21,580
Can you hear me? Are you listening? Listen to me. Listen, listen, listen.

814
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:35,020
I like it, all right? I like it. I like it. I like League of Legends. All right? All right? All right?

815
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,820
I like League of Legends.

816
00:59:44,380 --> 01:00:10,940
Look, look, look, look, look, look. I don't know why. Look, I don't know why.

817
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:19,660
I don't know why. I do not recommend playing this game. Don't play it. It's a dictation.

818
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:29,740
But I played it for so long. I played it for so long. For so, so very long. All right? I can't help it.

819
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:37,100
It's a good game for me. I don't listen. I don't, I don't really talk in the chat. I don't really

820
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:43,340
talk in the, in the game. I don't really, I just like to turn off my brain, play some good old norms,

821
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:51,660
go mid lane, and just farm, murder a person in a game.

822
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:59,660
And, and, and, you know, just chat, you know? It's like really, it's like,

823
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:06,300
it's like the, it's like a good chatting stream for me. I have ADHD and I like flashing colors,

824
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:14,060
okay? I like the flashing colors and the abilities. While I'm just literally staring at my screen,

825
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:31,820
all right? I've gotten so far in the game as in like, it's like, it's like a, it's like a

826
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:41,500
gotcha game, almost kind of like, similar. Yeah. I have so much stuff on it, on the account that I had

827
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:47,260
that I, I didn't want to stop playing. I collected so much stuff. I was like, I don't want to stop

828
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:55,260
playing. I got so much stuff, I could get more, more, I need more, more, please, more, please, more.

829
01:01:55,740 --> 01:02:05,980
Please, please. I almost have every champion, more champions, more, more.

830
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:12,620
We can fix her.

831
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:24,380
We're rolled to your man. I usually made mid. I usually made mid lane, but sometimes I go support.

832
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:32,140
But I made mid. My favorite champion that I like to play is Zyra.

833
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:37,500
She's a babe, bro. That's a very hot babe.

834
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,620
Something about her seeds being inside of you, some chat.

835
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:49,660
Isn't that one of her lines?

836
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:56,780
Wait until my, wait as I plant my seeds inside of you.

837
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:02,940
That's one of her voice lines. I swear. I swear.

838
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:05,980
I swear.

839
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:07,340
Wait.

840
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:19,340
I swear.

841
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,820
I could be a little bit thummy sometimes.

842
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,220
Hey, sometimes.

843
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,580
Only if you want me to be.

844
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:49,260
Look, all right. I know some of you have sent me a lot of things asking if I was

845
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:55,980
so boredom and stuff like that, but I'm, I'm, I'm just, I'm weird.

846
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:04,620
You'll get what I give you and you'll love it regardless. So does it really matter?

847
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:10,300
You'll probably get a little bit of both. So, you know.

848
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:12,140
All right.

849
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,220
That's the first one. The answer is I swear to you.

850
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,580
Chat volume warning.

851
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:42,140
Okay. We've been on this slide for a while. We could always talk about more anime

852
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:47,020
and another like Zazzledon stream or something. It's a little just chatting stream.

853
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:59,980
So let's move on. I want to just go over some more things and stuff with you guys.

854
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:10,780
We, we spent over an hour on that. Maybe we could talk more about it another time.

855
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:19,580
We have, we have more than enough time to talk about so many things, right?

856
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:21,900
So many, so many things.

857
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:26,140
But yes.

858
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:37,980
To say my name was anime talk true. All right. I'm about to keep thing up with time. So

859
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:47,740
it feels shorter. It really does. It feels like we just started.

860
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,260
I do want to say

861
01:05:53,580 --> 01:06:04,780
that these cookies have been staring at me this entire time and they're taunting me.

862
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:07,420
And I want to eat them. I want to eat them so bad.

863
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:24,780
I want you to understand me. I want you to know that I do. I know a lot of people were like confused

864
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:35,100
about my, wait, was that, was it squishy, squishy, squishy, squishy? Are you a baker? Because I want to

865
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:49,740
grab your, bro, bro, bro.

866
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:54,700
Squishy why? Squishy why?

867
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:06,620
I thought it was like a genuine question.

868
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:11,180
I got trolled.

869
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:26,300
Dang it. Papa's over here scaring, trolling me.

870
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:41,100
I believe there is a public discord server that gives you notifications when we go live and

871
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:48,060
stuff. But we are not in it. You will not find us in it. But I do recommend joining it if you

872
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:52,620
want updates for when everyone goes live. Especially me. Because I know you want to be

873
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:59,980
up to date whenever I'm here. I want everyone to see me, hear my voice, talk to me.

874
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,140
Oh my god.

875
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,020
I'm gone.

876
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:18,540
Oh my tootie crap.

877
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:35,820
I didn't go anywhere. I don't know what you're talking about. I was here the whole time.

878
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:39,340
I was here the whole time.

879
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:59,020
Oh, we're fine. Everything's fine. Everything's okay.

880
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:14,060
You're probably going to experience so much scuff and all my streams, extreme extreme scuff.

881
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:21,020
We're fine. Everything's great.

882
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:40,220
All right. So yes, I am a baker. I bake stuff sometimes when I'm like feeling like in a really

883
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:45,500
mood to have sweets and I really want it. I make brownies, cupcakes, cakes.

884
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:52,140
I was learning how to make cheesecakes and all sorts of stuff. Grand crackers, cookies.

885
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:56,300
So many other stuff.

886
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:07,660
So, however, these are things that I wanted to do on stream, like a handcam stream and stuff like

887
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:15,180
that. So I want to do these things. I want to cook for you guys and show you my cakes and stuff,

888
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:21,020
but I am very limited in being able to do that with my living situation.

889
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:37,020
Yeah, I live with a pretty big family. So doing that won't be possible right away.

890
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:50,460
So when I'm able to move out, which I hope is soon, but I would have to save up quite a bit

891
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:58,940
before I could do that. I will be free to do a lot more things for streams and stuff like that.

892
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:04,060
That's so sudden.

893
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:14,780
I want to make threads and fake stuff.

894
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:28,140
For now, I could just like show you like pictures and stuff on stream or on Twitter,

895
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:40,700
the Twitter, Twitter, or X, I mean, sorry, X, X, Xter, X sweeter. What do you call it?

896
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:44,620
Is it okay to say that here? Can I say that here?

897
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:50,460
I want to show you pictures and stuff, and I'll do that and stuff right now.

898
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:03,820
I still call it Twitter.

899
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:16,300
I want, I think, Stronius spoke about this, about how there were some people wanting to make

900
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:21,660
cover songs. I think I was one of the girls that really, really, really, really, really,

901
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:37,660
super one to make of our song. I want to sing for you guys. I want to sing for you guys.

902
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:50,780
I sing songs and stuff for you. I'm very subconscious of my voice when I speak normally. I'm really

903
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:58,460
surprised you guys like my voice. I was really surprised when Stroni liked my voice. I was

904
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:05,660
all very surprised. This is a very honest opinion of mine. A lot of people think my voice is fake

905
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:11,980
or my voice is like I'm doing too much. There are people who would always tell me that I sound

906
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:19,660
like a child or a kid. Or I sound like a pupas and child and stuff like that. People tell me that

907
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:25,980
all the time. But I've been very subconscious of my voice for a long time.

908
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:37,420
To me, I think my voice is horrible. But a lot of you really like my voice. So I'm happy. You do.

909
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:49,500
I'm happy. I'm glad you like it. But I do have a list. So I pronounce a lot of words really

910
01:13:49,500 --> 01:14:01,340
badly. I have a really bad list. List. List. I swear the person who created that word is evil.

911
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:07,340
They created that word knowing that people with one can't say it. They're evil. That's all I'll say.

912
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:31,740
They're evil. So that's why I speak the way I speak. Because I have a list.

913
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:36,460
So I'm sorry. I'm really sorry if my grammar is wack.

914
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:48,700
Or we're getting off track.

915
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:16,700
I am

916
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:27,820
really new to the ASMR scene.

917
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:37,180
I hope you don't mind. I'm a little new to ASMR scene.

918
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:49,180
So I hope you don't mind.

919
01:15:49,420 --> 01:16:02,380
Drunk. A lot of people say that. That I sound like that. That I'm drunk. Do I?

920
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:09,340
Really? Do I sound like I'm drunk? But you don't really want to know what it really sounds like

921
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:30,620
when I get drunk. I don't know how a drunk person really sounds. But this is how I sound.

922
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:35,900
I don't know. It's very common. A lot of people say it. My family says the same thing to me.

923
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:42,220
That I always sound like I'm drunk. So I don't know. I think it's just my speech. It's very slurrish.

924
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:48,940
It's very slurrish. And the combination of the list makes it a lot more worse.

925
01:16:54,700 --> 01:17:03,500
So yeah. I do have plans to do a drunk stream. But I want to also go over some things that

926
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:12,140
I kind of have to deal with that. With the drinking part thing. So

927
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:19,420
I do want to let everyone know that I am a little sickly.

928
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:33,900
I've been sick since I was like really young. I've had a lot of issues going on with like

929
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:45,340
my stomach. Intestinal issues. A lot of issues there. They found like a

930
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:49,180
kind of like a mass. But not like a

931
01:17:51,340 --> 01:18:04,940
the the C word. Serous. The C word. Serous mass. It was found in my nose. My nasal cavity.

932
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:11,980
And it infected a lot of tissue. And I had to get that surgically removed.

933
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:21,340
So I have a lot of nasal issues. So that could also be why I sound kind of stuffy if I do to you.

934
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:28,940
But my nasal patches is pretty cleared up now after the surgery. So I'm good now.

935
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:35,740
So every now and then you'll probably I'll have to probably like spray my nose.

936
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:41,180
Just in case I get really stuffy. And then I start sounding like this the entire time.

937
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:48,140
Like I'm Squidward. And we don't want that.

938
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:02,940
So yeah.

939
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:10,140
So we don't want that.

940
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:31,340
I'm going miles per second. I click something I shouldn't have. All right, all right, we're fine.

941
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:48,700
And I'm not really green guys. I'm like I'm like a teal. I'm blue. All right. I look green.

942
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:59,740
But I'm blue. Don't let the colors fool you. The color spectrum is evil. All right. It's evil.

943
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:02,780
I see green. Yeah, I'm blue. All right.

944
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:16,620
I'm blue. And these are neck pillows. They are ears. They are my little gold ears. Okay. They're ears.

945
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:20,860
Please, please. Thank you.

946
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:35,980
That is all. Welcome back. Thank you for participating in my talk. Thank you.

947
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:36,700
Thank you.

948
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:51,980
But yes, I got a lot of physical issues with my shoulder.

949
01:20:53,980 --> 01:21:01,180
My shoulder didn't develop properly. My shoulder didn't develop properly. And it took them like

950
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:06,460
many years for them to figure this out. So they finally took x-ray after telling me that I was

951
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:11,580
fine saying it was stress, stress, stress, stress, stress, stress. It's fine. It's fine. You're fine.

952
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:17,820
You're fine. And then they finally took x-ray. I got a better doctor like this is my 10th 12th

953
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:24,220
doctor that I went through. And they finally took x-ray. They seen that my shoulder is

954
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:33,260
didn't develop fully. So it causes pain in my right hand and in my elbow. And it travels

955
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:38,780
through my whole arm. So I have extreme pain. So I'm on like a bunch of pain medication.

956
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:47,180
So it makes me kind of loopy a little bit. So I'm just another reason why I probably sound like I'm

957
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:59,580
drunk. I also have my spine at my neck is isn't curved like a sea like it's supposed to. It's

958
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:07,500
actually straight. So I have permanent headaches that don't really go away. And I've had them

959
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:09,500
for a long time for years.

960
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:21,260
So I got a, I have pink colors for that too.

961
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:35,020
So yeah.

962
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:37,020
This is where I'm going to be the second care of you.

963
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:48,780
No.

964
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:59,660
I'm fine. Don't worry. I'm fine. I just want to be treated like everyone else.

965
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:06,380
A lot of people I usually tell always end up feeling really bad for me. Don't feel bad for me.

966
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:13,260
I just want to live my life. I want to live a life. It was really hard enough for me to

967
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:20,060
find work like outside of everything. People wouldn't hire me. And when they did hire me,

968
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:24,860
I was limited to doing stuff and they didn't like that. And I had to visit, I have to visit

969
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:34,300
a doctor every week. I have doctor's appointments every week. So they were upset that I had to

970
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:39,500
take time off every week. They didn't like that. They wanted me, they wanted all my time. So they

971
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:47,260
would always end up, you know, firing me. Whenever I got randomly sick on the job, they would get

972
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:55,900
upset. Ambulance had to come pick me up one time because I got really, really badly sick.

973
01:23:56,860 --> 01:24:04,220
So I had stomach problems. So my stomach is very sensitive. If I eat certain food,

974
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:10,300
I could get food poisoning pretty easy. It could be really bad.

975
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:19,980
So I have a lot of issues. I don't mind talking about them. I really don't. I think I

976
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:26,700
saw that in there. I can show you. I don't mind talking about them. I don't. However,

977
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:33,580
I would appreciate if people wouldn't ask too much questions on it though. I appreciate it.

978
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:39,100
Please, please thank you. I just want to let you know now so that everyone knows and that if

979
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:43,420
anyone else asks, it's out there. The information is out there.

980
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:50,300
Okay, yeah, yeah.

981
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:51,020
Yeah.

982
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:10,220
There's some other issues I have. But a lot of it just deals with my, I was kind of

983
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:18,620
malnourished for a while. Yes, I'm a huge eater. I eat a lot and I used to, I have a really fast

984
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:28,780
metabolism. So I would eat like nonstop. This was like a few years ago. I used to eat like

985
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:36,860
three pizza pies, three whole pizza pies by myself. My metabolism is that fast. It was

986
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:40,540
that fast. I think it's slowly slowing down. Maybe, I don't know, I don't think so.

987
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:51,900
I eat a lot. So I'm a big foodie. I like food a lot.

988
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:06,620
But because of this, because I eat a ton or not enough when I need to, because I can go like

989
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:12,540
days without eating because I will forget. I feel like I like have this thing where I forget to eat.

990
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:23,260
And I wouldn't eat for days and stuff like that. So and then I'll have a random binge day and I'd

991
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:32,060
eat like a ton. So technically today, today I forgot to eat. Today, today I forgot to eat.

992
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:35,260
I'll tell the ones I didn't eat today.

993
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:47,260
I also forgot to eat yesterday.

994
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:57,420
But my family made me something to eat yesterday after they built. Don't worry.

995
01:26:57,820 --> 01:27:03,900
Don't worry. Don't worry. I ate a little bit yesterday. It wasn't a lot, but I still ate a

996
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:08,700
little bit yesterday. Like a plate. I ate like one plate of something.

997
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:15,500
Don't tell everyone. No. Don't tell everyone. No. Don't tell.

998
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:29,660
Eat silly. Oh, eat. Eat. Don't tell Stroney. Don't tell Stroney.

999
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:39,260
But that's really just scold me. I'm getting in trouble. I'm getting in trouble.

1000
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:50,780
Let me eat the cookies. I have cookies. I have cookies. I'll eat this. I'll eat this.

1001
01:27:51,580 --> 01:28:00,700
What the? Isn't this supposed to be like a a flap? Oh, you peel it like this.

1002
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:13,660
Cool. Okay. That's my acacia slice. I sat on them so I broke them. I accidentally sat on them.

1003
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:16,540
I forgot I put them in my in my in my chair.

1004
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:48,540
Free ASMR.

1005
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:54,540
It should have been me. It's not fair.

1006
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:00,540
It should have been me.

1007
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:01,420
It should have been me.

1008
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:17,420
Nani water. Hang on. It should have been me. Not him.

1009
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:37,420
Well, was that a good impersonation?

1010
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:53,740
All right. I ate a cookie. There you go.

1011
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:01,660
I ate a cookie and got any milk with those cookies? I do.

1012
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:12,780
Yeah, I got milk. Got milk. Yeah.

1013
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:18,860
I like to drink tea with these, though, these cookies. They're

1014
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:25,420
what do you call it? They're shortbread cookies called

1015
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:33,980
Lorna Dome? Lorna Dome? Lorna Dome? Lorna Dome or Lorna Dome? I don't know. One of the two.

1016
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:42,300
Yeah, Lorna Dome or Lorna Dome cookie. They're good. They're my favorite. I like those a lot. Good cookies.

1017
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:57,580
They're like, yeah, they're like, it's called shortbread, shortbread cookies.

1018
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:02,220
Sort of like a, I don't know if it's a biscuit. Maybe a biscuit?

1019
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:04,220
That's a biscuit.

1020
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:12,940
It's pronounced Dome. Lorna Dome. Lorna Dome. Yeah, Lorna Dome.

1021
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:22,940
Yeah, it tastes really good with tea. I like it with tea the most.

1022
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:29,500
If you guys have them, you should try it. I think you should.

1023
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:36,220
They're yummy. I have a really big sweet tooth and a salty tooth. I don't know if you call it a salty tooth.

1024
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:45,020
I really like salt, salty foods, like really, really salty foods. I have a slim gym addiction.

1025
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:57,980
Oh my god, I have HD bad. Like, we were talking about one thing and then we go to another and then to another and then to another and then to another, we never stay on topic.

1026
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,980
I

1027
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:13,580
Need tea recommendations

1028
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:18,380
I know I'm gonna say this tea wrong and

1029
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:21,740
A lot of people always correct me

1030
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:25,020
But say it wrong on is it

1031
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:27,820
Chum, chum, chum

1032
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:30,940

1036
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:46,300
Chum, oh, lech, chum, chum, ah, chum, ah, chum, oh

1037
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:49,260
My oh, chum, oh my oh

1038
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:51,580
Oh

1039
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:13,660
Come on meal come on meal come on meal come on here come on here. Yeah

1040
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:18,140
Come on, yeah

1041
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:37,780
Yeah, I'm a meal T. Yeah, yeah, that one.

1042
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:48,460
I did it.

1043
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:49,860
I do like Camomile tea.

1044
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:53,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1045
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,340
And Earl Grey.

1046
01:33:55,340 --> 01:33:56,300
I like Earl Grey.

1047
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:57,180
I really like tea.

1048
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:58,620
Different types of tea.

1049
01:33:58,620 --> 01:33:59,900
Drink many types.

1050
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:02,220
I like milk tea as well.

1051
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,220
Milk tea is good.

1052
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:27,220
You guys want to know a secret?

1053
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:42,540
Come here, tell your secret, tell your secret.

1054
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:59,540
I'm lactose intolerant.

1055
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:27,940
I'm fat and I'm also sugar intolerant.

1056
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:54,980
I can't have gluten, I can't have gluten.

1057
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:57,940
But that doesn't stop me, all right?

1058
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:00,420
I love me some cheese.

1059
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:07,660
I love me some milk, some good old ice cream.

1060
01:36:07,660 --> 01:36:11,020
I should be eating these cookies right now, but here we are.

1061
01:36:11,020 --> 01:36:12,020
Oh, yeah.

1062
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:14,020
So good.

1063
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:27,020
So good.

1064
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:47,020
It's so good.

1065
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:49,020
How could you not?

1066
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:51,020
How could you not?

1067
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:53,020
It's like a curse.

1068
01:36:53,020 --> 01:37:07,020
All my favorite foods consist of milk and sugar.

1069
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:09,020
I just have to be careful.

1070
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:15,020
And so I know someone asked me about what kind of milk I like.

1071
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:23,020
And I've been drinking almond milk, but I think I might have a slight peanut allergy,

1072
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:24,020
but I'm not sure.

1073
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:34,020
So I'm going to go take a test to go find out soon.

1074
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:36,020
Almond milk is so good though.

1075
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:41,020
I did the sweetened one though, and I didn't realize that there was a sweetened version,

1076
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:54,020
and I grabbed that without looking, brought that home, drunk that, and then died the next day.

1077
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:55,020
It was bad.

1078
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:57,020
It was my stomach.

1079
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:00,020
It was so bad.

1080
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:07,020
What happened?

1081
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:09,020
What's going on?

1082
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:12,020
Why does it hurt so bad?

1083
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:15,020
Help, help me.

1084
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:36,020
I've never had rice milk before, or oat milk before, and I want to try it.

1085
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:38,020
I want to try it.

1086
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:45,020
So maybe I'll try it out on another Zazzledon stream, or just chatting the stream like now,

1087
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:48,020
until you guess how I feel about it.

1088
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:52,020
I hope you guys have like brands.

1089
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:53,020
I need brands.

1090
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:54,020
I need the fine ones.

1091
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:56,020
Find the best ones.

1092
01:38:57,020 --> 01:39:01,020
I can drink and stuff.

1093
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:11,020
Milk sampling stream.

1094
01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:12,020
Yeah!

1095
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:14,020
All kinds of milk.

1096
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:24,020
I think rice milk.

1097
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:34,020
Don't they use rice milk or just rice to make rice wine or something like that?

1098
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:40,020
Or am I like having a moment right now?

1099
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:42,020
Cause I don't know.

1100
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:50,020
Yeah, sake.

1101
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:57,020
Yeah, sake.

1102
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:01,020
Is it just rice?

1103
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:06,020
I thought they put rice milk in it as well.

1104
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:11,020
Or is that just different brands of sake that do different things?

1105
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:13,020
Or am I just...

1106
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:18,020
I've only had sake once.

1107
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:20,020
One time.

1108
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:24,020
And on the menu, it was called rice wine.

1109
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:25,020
So...

1110
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:30,020
That was the first time I had sake.

1111
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:32,020
And I don't remember...

1112
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:35,020
Don't remember...

1113
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:40,020
What it tasted like.

1114
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:46,020
Because before that, I was drinking a lot of soju.

1115
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:49,020
I was kind of drunk that day.

1116
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:52,020
I was drinking a lot of soju.

1117
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:55,020
I was a really, really big drunk that day.

1118
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:04,020
And then we visited like Korean barbecue.

1119
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:06,020
Korean barbecue.

1120
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:08,020
Korean barbecue.

1121
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:17,020
It's not a vibe.

1122
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:20,020
It's not that scary.

1123
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:22,020
But she's just hot.

1124
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:26,020
She gets really strict when she needs to.

1125
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:29,020
I might do later on down the line.

1126
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:31,020
I could see it happening.

1127
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:47,020
So, I wanted to say that...

1128
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:55,020
To go over all the sick stuff that I've mentioned so far.

1129
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:59,020
If you can remember all the things I just listed.

1130
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:02,020
Because there was all over the place, I'm sorry.

1131
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:10,020
In order to keep up with my health, I have to do a bit of exercise.

1132
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:15,020
I'm gonna keep myself nice and fat.

1133
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:18,020
Nice and fat.

1134
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:24,020
I forgot.

1135
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:31,020
Which is what gave me the idea.

1136
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:35,020
To do ASMR workout streams.

1137
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:40,020
Where I whisper and tell you guys where to go.

1138
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:44,020
And we exercise together.

1139
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:03,020
So, we could do my workouts together.

1140
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:06,020
So, I have to do things like yoga.

1141
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:09,020
And keep my arm strength up.

1142
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:12,020
To handle my shoulder issue.

1143
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:14,020
And my neck issue.

1144
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:19,020
Because if the rest of my body can't hold up my own big old head.

1145
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:25,020
I had to make it all strong.

1146
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:32,020
I had to make it all strong to help with that pain.

1147
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:34,020
My doctors are yelling at me.

1148
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:36,020
You need to get stronger.

1149
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:38,020
Stronger. Worked out.

1150
01:43:38,020 --> 01:43:40,020
Unfit.

1151
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:42,020
So, I had to do that.

1152
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:46,020
Pits just arrived.

1153
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:49,020
I'm so jealous.

1154
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:52,020
So, yeah.

1155
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:55,020
So, with all the food I'm eating and stuff.

1156
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:57,020
Can go to...

1157
01:43:58,020 --> 01:44:01,020
The rest of my body.

1158
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:07,020
And I cannot...

1159
01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:10,020
You know.

1160
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:14,020
Be a big, big, big strong.

1161
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:31,020
So, those streams will probably be...

1162
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:33,020
I don't...

1163
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:36,020
I think those will be streams here on YouTube.

1164
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:39,020
If I'm able to.

1165
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:42,020
Because I'm not sure if I...

1166
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:45,020
Those would be okay to do.

1167
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:48,020
Maybe we could like test the waters.

1168
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:51,020
But I'd have to see how Stroni feels about that.

1169
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:54,020
And then...

1170
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:56,020
Um...

1171
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:03,020
I know a lot of people really want me to do...

1172
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:05,020
Like the...

1173
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:09,020
The hypnosis stuff.

1174
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:11,020
And the...

1175
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:15,020
Extreme dummy stuff.

1176
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:17,020
Or be extreme dumb.

1177
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:19,020
I think I covered some of that.

1178
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:23,020
But I don't think I'm going to be taking over any of the girls.

1179
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:24,020
Other girls' roles.

1180
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:26,020
That's their thing.

1181
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:28,020
That's what they do.

1182
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:30,020
And...

1183
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:32,020
I would have to discuss...

1184
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:34,020
Maybe some...

1185
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:38,020
Things...

1186
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:42,020
With my gen mates to see how they feel about it.

1187
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:45,020
Maybe collabs or something.

1188
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:48,020
A little collab here and there.

1189
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:50,020
You know?

1190
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:53,020
I like to be vague.

1191
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:56,020
I don't like telling you guys anything.

1192
01:45:56,020 --> 01:45:59,020
I know everyone else is really sharing with you.

1193
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:01,020
On what everyone's doing.

1194
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:04,020
But I like to surprise people.

1195
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:07,020
I really like to stay on the download.

1196
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:09,020
And I go...

1197
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:12,020
I did a thing.

1198
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:14,020
Do you see it?

1199
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:16,020
Are you looking at it?

1200
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:18,020
Do you like it?

1201
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:24,020
I don't like sharing.

1202
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:26,020
I like the mystery.

1203
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:27,020
It's fun.

1204
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:29,020
And I love seeing all your reactions.

1205
01:46:29,020 --> 01:46:31,020
When it does come out.

1206
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:33,020
Where everyone freaks out.

1207
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:36,020
Talking about how I'm hiding my true powers.

1208
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:38,020
I've seen the morows.

1209
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:42,020
I got quite a few morows about the shock.

1210
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:48,020
I bide my time and wait.

1211
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:50,020
To surprise you.

1212
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:53,020
Mystery milk.

1213
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:06,020
So there are things in the work.

1214
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:09,020
And there are things that are being planned out.

1215
01:47:09,020 --> 01:47:12,020
And it caters quite a lot.

1216
01:47:12,020 --> 01:47:15,020
To a lot of the things that were asked for.

1217
01:47:15,020 --> 01:47:17,020
Some of the...

1218
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:20,020
A lot of the things that were asked for.

1219
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:31,020
So you won't have to worry about a thing.

1220
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:33,020
It's probably gonna be there.

1221
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:35,020
Most likely.

1222
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:39,020
But will I say it is?

1223
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:51,020
So if anyone wants to know about any of the saucier stuff.

1224
01:47:51,020 --> 01:47:54,020
ASMRs and stuff that's most likely gonna be on the Patreon.

1225
01:47:54,020 --> 01:47:56,020
You'll find it.

1226
01:47:56,020 --> 01:47:58,020
In the description.

1227
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:02,020
If anyone else wants to send me more morows.

1228
01:48:02,020 --> 01:48:04,020
That's also in the description.

1229
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:09,020
Is that what you call?

1230
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:11,020
Did I do that right?

1231
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:15,020
Did I do that right?

1232
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:20,020
I do like teasing.

1233
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:22,020
It's fun.

1234
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:28,020
Yes!

1235
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:29,020
Mertz 2.

1236
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:30,020
Mertz 2.

1237
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:32,020
Also in the description.

1238
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:34,020
No, just sleep under your chair.

1239
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:35,020
My ears.

1240
01:48:35,020 --> 01:48:37,020
You wanna see one of my ears?

1241
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:39,020
Please, thank you.

1242
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:42,020
Are they nice and fluffy?

1243
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:46,020
Are they really soft?

1244
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:48,020
You wanna touch them?

1245
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:52,020
Wanna wrap them around you like a blanket?

1246
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:57,020
I'm gonna get on to the merch very soon.

1247
01:48:57,020 --> 01:49:00,020
I was going to save that for last.

1248
01:49:00,020 --> 01:49:03,020
Okay, we'll talk about that soon.

1249
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:06,020
Thank you for the reminder.

1250
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:11,020
I have a list of things to talk to you guys about.

1251
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:13,020
We're gonna talk about this.

1252
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:14,020
We're gonna talk about this.

1253
01:49:14,020 --> 01:49:15,020
And then this.

1254
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:16,020
And then this.

1255
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:18,020
And then we just spend hours talking about anime.

1256
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:32,020
I don't think I...

1257
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:34,020
I'm not really...

1258
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:36,020
I'm really bad at using the moral.

1259
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:38,020
The marshmallow.

1260
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:40,020
The moral.

1261
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:42,020
I'm really bad at using it.

1262
01:49:42,020 --> 01:49:46,020
So I don't know how to post things.

1263
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:50,020
I'm so sorry.

1264
01:49:50,020 --> 01:49:51,020
It's like...

1265
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:55,020
It's my first time using this thing.

1266
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:59,020
So I'm slowly figuring things out.

1267
01:49:59,020 --> 01:50:01,020
So...

1268
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:04,020
What's that?

1269
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:06,020
The moral is the marshmallow.

1270
01:50:06,020 --> 01:50:09,020
Where you can ask me questions there.

1271
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:11,020
And usually I will answer your questions there.

1272
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:15,020
Or send it to you via there.

1273
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:18,020
So you can send me stuff in there.

1274
01:50:18,020 --> 01:50:20,020
And you know.

1275
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:27,020
I'm like old.

1276
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:29,020
Says you.

1277
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:31,020
Says you.

1278
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:33,020
Gotta speaking.

1279
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:34,020
Hello.

1280
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:36,020
Been around for eons.

1281
01:50:36,020 --> 01:50:37,020
You know?

1282
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:38,020
Kinda...

1283
01:50:38,020 --> 01:50:40,020
Kinda been around for a long time.

1284
01:50:40,020 --> 01:50:42,020
You know?

1285
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:44,020
Been around for a long, really long time.

1286
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:45,020
You know?

1287
01:50:45,020 --> 01:50:46,020
Yeah.

1288
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:47,020
Uh...

1289
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:48,020
Yeah.

1290
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:49,020
Yeah.

1291
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:50,020
Yeah.

1292
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:51,020
Yeah.

1293
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:54,020
Got us here.

1294
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:57,020
Yee-haw.

1295
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:06,020
Hell yeah, brother.

1296
01:51:06,020 --> 01:51:07,020
That's right.

1297
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:08,020
That's what I'm talking about.

1298
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:09,020
That's it.

1299
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:10,020
That's it.

1300
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:11,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1301
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:12,020
Understand.

1302
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:13,020
That's good.

1303
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:14,020
Yeah, yeah.

1304
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:15,020
Yee-haw.

1305
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:18,020
Guess what?

1306
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:19,020
Those are good.

1307
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:20,020
Sorry.

1308
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:21,020
Sorry.

1309
01:51:21,020 --> 01:51:23,020
You could just...

1310
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:24,020
You could like...

1311
01:51:24,020 --> 01:51:27,020
There's like a permanent translate.

1312
01:51:27,020 --> 01:51:28,020
Like...

1313
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:29,020
I think...

1314
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:30,020
There's a permanent...

1315
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:31,020
You could add...

1316
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:34,020
You could put a permanent Google translate.

1317
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:36,020
At the top.

1318
01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:38,020
It pops up for me.

1319
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:39,020
You could like put a permanent...

1320
01:51:39,020 --> 01:51:40,020
Like a little...

1321
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:41,020
Little thingy.

1322
01:51:41,020 --> 01:51:42,020
Little thingy.

1323
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:44,020
And it translates it for you.

1324
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:48,020
Just hit random buttons until it works.

1325
01:51:53,020 --> 01:52:00,020
That's about it, kind of you.

1326
01:52:00,020 --> 01:52:09,020
We're riding away to the sunset with this one.

1327
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:19,020
I don't know if I should say...

1328
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:34,020
Yeah, I don't know if I should say...

1329
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:44,020
I know a lot of people are wondering what my accent is.

1330
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:56,020
I heard some cries about my accent and not being able to figure it out.

1331
01:52:56,020 --> 01:53:05,020
But I'm not Aussie though.

1332
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:08,020
Keep the accent a mystery?

1333
01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:09,020
Sure, I can do that.

1334
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:16,020
But what I can tell you is this.

1335
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:18,020
I am not Dutch.

1336
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:20,020
No, I'm learning Dutch.

1337
01:53:20,020 --> 01:53:27,020
I've traveled to the Netherlands before, I think last year.

1338
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:29,020
And it was fun.

1339
01:53:29,020 --> 01:53:33,020
So, I'm learning Dutch.

1340
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:37,020
Dutch, Dutch, Dutch, Dutch, Dutch.

1341
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:39,020
Alright, so I'm going to tell you.

1342
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:44,020
I don't speak various languages.

1343
01:53:44,020 --> 01:53:51,020
But I was raised around various communities.

1344
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:53,020
And...

1345
01:53:53,020 --> 01:53:55,020
What do you call it?

1346
01:54:03,020 --> 01:54:06,020
So what do you want it?

1347
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:23,020
Yes, I was raised around a lot of ethnic groups.

1348
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:34,020
She's just turning to her roots.

1349
01:54:34,020 --> 01:54:41,020
Thank you.

1350
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:43,020
Oh, my bleeding heart.

1351
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:48,020
That's so cute.

1352
01:54:48,020 --> 01:54:54,020
That's so cute.

1353
01:54:54,020 --> 01:55:00,020
I like that so much.

1354
01:55:00,020 --> 01:55:07,020
But when I was younger, I was raised around a lot of people who spoke Spanish.

1355
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:10,020
A lot of people who spoke Spanish.

1356
01:55:10,020 --> 01:55:13,020
I don't speak the language.

1357
01:55:13,020 --> 01:55:21,020
A lot of them were Mexican and Puerto Rican.

1358
01:55:21,020 --> 01:55:26,020
So I was raised around a lot of people who spoke Spanish for a long time.

1359
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:32,020
So I don't speak Spanish, but because they spoke to me in Spanish a lot and never in English,

1360
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:35,020
I had to learn to understand Spanish.

1361
01:55:35,020 --> 01:55:42,020
I'm not good at it now, but I was really good at it before where they would talk to me, have a conversation in Spanish,

1362
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:45,020
and I would just do or respond in English.

1363
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:49,020
So I cannot read Spanish.

1364
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:55,020
I can't read it. I can't do that. I'm sorry.

1365
01:55:55,020 --> 01:56:05,020
And then as I got older, I was raised around a lot of people who spoke Japanese and Korean and Mandarin.

1366
01:56:05,020 --> 01:56:16,020
I met a lot of people who came overseas to visit where I live, and they spoke Japanese.

1367
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:21,020
So I learned a lot from them when I was younger.

1368
01:56:21,020 --> 01:56:23,020
I just so happened to be interested in anime.

1369
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:28,020
So a lot of people used to be like, oh, you want to be trying to do that.

1370
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:30,020
You want to be, want to be, want to be.

1371
01:56:30,020 --> 01:56:33,020
It's whatever. I don't care.

1372
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:47,020
But I was friends with a lot of people who were Asian, so I just picked up a lot of their manualisms.

1373
01:56:47,020 --> 01:56:56,020
I picked up a lot of their manualisms, and I started learning Korean and Japanese back then.

1374
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:59,020
No, not Cantonese, but Tengalong.

1375
01:56:59,020 --> 01:57:01,020
And Tengalong.

1376
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:08,020
I knew some people who spoke Tengalong, which I think is the Philippines.

1377
01:57:08,020 --> 01:57:13,020
Filipino. I was friends with a lot of Filipinos.

1378
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:26,020
And then as I got older, as I got older, I was friends with a lot of people who spoke Russian.

1379
01:57:26,020 --> 01:57:47,020
I didn't travel. I didn't go anywhere. I just happened to meet these people.

1380
01:57:47,020 --> 01:57:49,020
I was just surrounded by these people.

1381
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:53,020
You know how you meet one person, and then they introduce you to their group of friends,

1382
01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:57,020
and their whole group of friends speak that one language, but you, you're the only one?

1383
01:57:57,020 --> 01:58:02,020
I was always the one person in the group that spoke only English.

1384
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:05,020
That was me. I was that person.

1385
01:58:05,020 --> 01:58:15,020
I was always the one person in every group, so just the one person that didn't speak the language.

1386
01:58:15,020 --> 01:58:18,020
I was that one person.

1387
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:29,020
So, yeah.

1388
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:36,020
So I met a bunch of people who spoke Russian, and then they started teaching me Russian, and they started teaching me.

1389
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:46,020
And they started, like, talking about it and doing that and doing this, and I was like, oh, yeah, it's cool, it's cool.

1390
01:58:46,020 --> 01:58:56,020
And then there was some people in the group who were Swedish and Poland.

1391
01:58:56,020 --> 01:59:04,020
And so they started teaching me some of the things that they say, some of the words they say, and Swedish and Poland, and I was like, oh, cool, cool, cool.

1392
01:59:04,020 --> 01:59:07,020
I started learning that for, like, a year.

1393
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:12,020
But of course, nothing sticks because I'm dumb.

1394
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:20,020
Nothing ever sticks. I'm interested in it for a little while, and then I just kind of, like, since I have no one to talk to in that language, it's gone.

1395
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:22,020
It's gone.

1396
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:44,020
And then after that, after that, I started learning Dutch, yeah.

1397
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:50,020
And then I actually left for the first time ever to go to the Netherlands.

1398
01:59:50,020 --> 02:00:02,020
That was my first time ever leaving my country.

1399
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:08,020
That was my first time. I've never left it before, so I was excited.

1400
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:14,020
It was very scary, but it was really fun.

1401
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:21,020
I was very happy, and I had a lot of fun. I ate a lot of food, and it was really fun.

1402
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:23,020
Would I go again? Yes.

1403
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:34,020
I want to travel more. It's like my biggest dream, because with my health, I was scared that I wasn't going to be able to do that.

1404
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:40,020
To travel and stuff, because my health is, like, really bad.

1405
02:00:40,020 --> 02:00:46,020
So I was very happy to travel for the first time ever.

1406
02:00:46,020 --> 02:00:51,020
And when I got my passport, I was so excited. I cried.

1407
02:00:51,020 --> 02:00:53,020
I got emotional.

1408
02:00:54,020 --> 02:00:59,020
I was crying.

1409
02:01:02,020 --> 02:01:06,020
It was good. It was good. It was fun. I had a fun time.

1410
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:14,020
Okay.

1411
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:29,020
Oh, thank you.

1412
02:01:29,020 --> 02:01:34,020
Oh, thank you.

1413
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:44,020
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

1414
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:46,020
I'm so sorry.

1415
02:01:47,020 --> 02:01:51,020
We're fine. We're fine.

1416
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:57,020
I'm a big strong girl.

1417
02:01:57,020 --> 02:02:00,020
I don't cry.

1418
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:04,020
Crying. I don't do that.

1419
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:10,020
We don't cry here.

1420
02:02:16,020 --> 02:02:20,020
We're fine.

1421
02:02:24,020 --> 02:02:27,020
More.

1422
02:02:27,020 --> 02:02:29,020
Why?

1423
02:02:29,020 --> 02:02:32,020
But yeah.

1424
02:02:33,020 --> 02:02:42,020
But the last thing on this thread I wanted to mention was fan art.

1425
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:55,020
I'm okay with any fan art, as long as it's not, you know, the, you know, that word down there.

1426
02:02:56,020 --> 02:02:59,020
As long as it's not done, we're fine.

1427
02:02:59,020 --> 02:03:02,020
Please and thank you.

1428
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:07,020
Draw what you want. Draw what you will.

1429
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:12,020
Anything goes. I don't care on paper, little doodles.

1430
02:03:12,020 --> 02:03:15,020
I don't care. Art is art. There's not just anything as bad art.

1431
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:18,020
I don't care what it looks like.

1432
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:21,020
Let me share it with the world.

1433
02:03:21,020 --> 02:03:24,020
I really like art. I'm an artist myself.

1434
02:03:24,020 --> 02:03:28,020
I draw too, but I'm a lazy artist.

1435
02:03:28,020 --> 02:03:33,020
So you only get flat colors and messy sketches from me.

1436
02:03:33,020 --> 02:03:41,020
I do draw really detailed stuff sometimes, but I have really bad.

1437
02:03:41,020 --> 02:03:49,020
I have a zone that I get into and I can draw for hours.

1438
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:52,020
I remember drawing for like 24 hours.

1439
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:56,020
I didn't eat. I didn't sleep.

1440
02:03:56,020 --> 02:03:58,020
I didn't use the bathroom.

1441
02:03:58,020 --> 02:04:03,020
I don't know what happened. It was like a zone. I was in a zone.

1442
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:13,020
And I went into extreme details on the art that I drew and I was like going in and I'm like, yeah.

1443
02:04:13,020 --> 02:04:19,020
And if I stop, I can never get that back and draw what was ever on my mind.

1444
02:04:19,020 --> 02:04:25,020
And then I get like stuck and I can't finish the piece and it goes undone forever.

1445
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:31,020
So I get in a zone and I can't really leave it.

1446
02:04:31,020 --> 02:04:36,020
So that's why I only doodle like sketches and I try to leave it at that.

1447
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:40,020
I do a doodle and I throw a little color in there and I leave it.

1448
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:45,020
Or it's just the doodle when I go like I did. I posted this.

1449
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:53,020
So yeah.

1450
02:04:53,020 --> 02:05:00,020
Yeah, I'm trying to keep you guys here for as long as possible.

1451
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:08,020
I'll give you company until you see your little sharp friend.

1452
02:05:08,020 --> 02:05:14,020
I was going to keep this so short, but I don't know. I don't know what happened.

1453
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:20,020
I don't know what happened. We just started rounding about everything.

1454
02:05:20,020 --> 02:05:28,020
This is supposed to be like a super short stream.

1455
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:31,020
I'm supposed to be so short.

1456
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:36,020
But I'm rambling. Oh gosh. Am I the apper?

1457
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:46,020
Am I the apper?

1458
02:05:46,020 --> 02:06:00,020
Time does fly when you're having fun. It's true. I agree.

1459
02:06:00,020 --> 02:06:06,020
Okay.

1460
02:06:06,020 --> 02:06:13,020
Speaking Japanese.

1461
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:19,020
Am I the endurance streamer from the company? Oh my gosh.

1462
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:24,020
Oh.

1463
02:06:24,020 --> 02:06:29,020
I did it.

1464
02:06:29,020 --> 02:06:35,020
Oh.

1465
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:40,020
Sorry.

1466
02:06:40,020 --> 02:06:44,020
The voice is pretty enough. I'm going to say thank you.

1467
02:06:45,020 --> 02:06:50,020
I really don't understand. You guys like my voice.

1468
02:06:50,020 --> 02:06:55,020
Even Amy brought it up earlier and she was talking about it.

1469
02:06:55,020 --> 02:06:59,020
She was conscious of her voice. I think her voice is so cute.

1470
02:06:59,020 --> 02:07:02,020
I wish I could have a voice like hers.

1471
02:07:02,020 --> 02:07:08,020
It's just soft.

1472
02:07:08,020 --> 02:07:11,020
I think it's so cute.

1473
02:07:11,020 --> 02:07:18,020
It's so cute.

1474
02:07:18,020 --> 02:07:23,020
And same goes for Icy's voice. Icy's voice is so cute.

1475
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:28,020
The small bien. The super small bien.

1476
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:33,020
I'm going to smush both of them.

1477
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:38,020
Smush them to their pop.

1478
02:07:38,020 --> 02:07:46,020
Everyone's voice is so good.

1479
02:07:46,020 --> 02:07:52,020
She's beginning to feel like a yep god.

1480
02:07:52,020 --> 02:07:58,020
A minimum reference.

1481
02:07:58,020 --> 02:08:02,020
I never really got to talk about my music taste.

1482
02:08:02,020 --> 02:08:06,020
It's a...

1483
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:10,020
Everyone has a taste. A specific genre of music.

1484
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:17,020
But I don't actually listen to extreme, huge range of music.

1485
02:08:17,020 --> 02:08:23,020
When I was younger, I used to be in a choir.

1486
02:08:23,020 --> 02:08:27,020
An advanced choir. So I sung songs a lot.

1487
02:08:27,020 --> 02:08:31,020
Choir like opera.

1488
02:08:31,020 --> 02:08:34,020
It's late.

1489
02:08:34,020 --> 02:08:37,020
It's a little bit you get.

1490
02:08:37,020 --> 02:08:41,020
You used to sing opera?

1491
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:45,020
I don't want it to be too loud for the microphone.

1492
02:08:45,020 --> 02:08:48,020
I'm scared I'm going to blow your ears off.

1493
02:08:48,020 --> 02:08:52,020
When I sing like that, it gets really loud.

1494
02:08:52,020 --> 02:08:57,020
I used to listen to all sorts of music.

1495
02:08:57,020 --> 02:09:01,020
Classical rap.

1496
02:09:01,020 --> 02:09:05,020
K-pop. Japanese songs.

1497
02:09:05,020 --> 02:09:09,020
Japanese rock. Japanese pop.

1498
02:09:09,020 --> 02:09:13,020
Regular pop.

1499
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:17,020
So many things. I listen to Mandarin songs.

1500
02:09:17,020 --> 02:09:20,020
Rock.

1501
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:23,020
Metal. I really like metal.

1502
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:27,020
Mose. They're fun too.

1503
02:09:27,020 --> 02:09:31,020
I listen to quite a bit.

1504
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:35,020
I would call it a bit of everything.

1505
02:09:35,020 --> 02:09:39,020
We never do karaoke streams.

1506
02:09:39,020 --> 02:09:43,020
I want to. I do.

1507
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:47,020
I do. I do. I do.

1508
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:51,020
But since it's like...

1509
02:09:51,020 --> 02:09:55,020
Since I usually end up singing randomly on stream.

1510
02:09:55,020 --> 02:09:59,020
Just randomly out of the blue.

1511
02:09:59,020 --> 02:10:03,020
I get a little nervous.

1512
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:07,020
When it comes to prepping for a karaoke stream. What songs are loud?

1513
02:10:07,020 --> 02:10:11,020
What can I pick? What can I sing?

1514
02:10:11,020 --> 02:10:15,020
You know how I get in trouble?

1515
02:10:15,020 --> 02:10:19,020
I'm nervous. I don't want to get in trouble.

1516
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:23,020
So I don't know what songs to pick. I don't know what is appropriate.

1517
02:10:23,020 --> 02:10:27,020
You know, the YouTubes.

1518
02:10:27,020 --> 02:10:31,020
Don't come for me.

1519
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:35,020
Bunk me upside the head and go dumb goat.

1520
02:10:35,020 --> 02:10:39,020
I'm so sorry.

1521
02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:47,020
I have a big range of music. I listen to a lot of anime.

1522
02:10:47,020 --> 02:10:51,020
Openings and songs. Opening and endings. I don't really skip them.

1523
02:10:51,020 --> 02:10:55,020
Because I like music. Music is like...

1524
02:10:55,020 --> 02:10:59,020
It speaks to me. It's my heart.

1525
02:10:59,020 --> 02:11:03,020
I get emotional when it comes to anime and music.

1526
02:11:03,020 --> 02:11:07,020
It's my heart. It's what I was raised for. For a long time.

1527
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:11,020
So if lyrics suddenly start... If I start finally paying attention.

1528
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:15,020
Usually you listen to a song and you never really...

1529
02:11:15,020 --> 02:11:19,020
You say you don't like the song. But then like a year later or two.

1530
02:11:19,020 --> 02:11:23,020
You listen to the lyrics and now you're like

1531
02:11:23,020 --> 02:11:27,020
What? Wow. This really hits me this time.

1532
02:11:27,020 --> 02:11:31,020
I like this. And now all of a sudden the song is your favorite.

1533
02:11:31,020 --> 02:11:35,020
After hitting on it for like a couple of years.

1534
02:11:35,020 --> 02:11:39,020
I kind of go through that quite often.

1535
02:11:45,020 --> 02:11:49,020
I'm crying in my room.

1536
02:11:53,020 --> 02:11:57,020
You feel the song but never learn it. This is true.

1537
02:11:57,020 --> 02:12:01,020
This is very true. I either feel the song, never learn it.

1538
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:05,020
Or hate the song. Don't bother to learn it.

1539
02:12:05,020 --> 02:12:09,020
End up liking it.

1540
02:12:09,020 --> 02:12:13,020
Or just... Or like a song

1541
02:12:13,020 --> 02:12:17,020
So much that it's the... That like...

1542
02:12:17,020 --> 02:12:21,020
You have to play this song every day. Every day you go outside.

1543
02:12:21,020 --> 02:12:25,020
Play that song. Or repeat. Not stop.

1544
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:29,020
I have songs like that. Where I like

1545
02:12:29,020 --> 02:12:33,020
listen to the song over and over and over again.

1546
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:37,020
It might be a little acoustic there.

1547
02:12:37,020 --> 02:12:41,020
And that record.

1548
02:12:41,020 --> 02:12:45,020
Um...

1549
02:12:45,020 --> 02:12:49,020
Uh oh.

1550
02:12:49,020 --> 02:12:53,020
Oh here we go. Okay chat like

1551
02:12:53,020 --> 02:12:57,020
froze for me for a second.

1552
02:12:57,020 --> 02:13:01,020
I couldn't even read chat.

1553
02:13:01,020 --> 02:13:05,020
The heck?

1554
02:13:05,020 --> 02:13:09,020
Sorry about that.

1555
02:13:09,020 --> 02:13:13,020
I'll just stop moving.

1556
02:13:13,020 --> 02:13:17,020
There we go.

1557
02:13:17,020 --> 02:13:21,020
Uh oh. Uh oh. I used to love Scooby-Doo.

1558
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:25,020
This was good stuff. Scooby-Doo was great.

1559
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:33,020
Now chat's back. You're back. Don't worry. It's fixed.

1560
02:13:33,020 --> 02:13:37,020
It's fixed. You're live. You're live. You're live.

1561
02:13:37,020 --> 02:13:41,020
You're back. You're back.

1562
02:13:47,020 --> 02:13:51,020
Do I like plays? Does that mean I like plays as well? Sometimes.

1563
02:13:51,020 --> 02:13:55,020
I am... I can't really... I have a hard time

1564
02:13:55,020 --> 02:13:59,020
focusing. So if the music isn't really catchy. Or like

1565
02:13:59,020 --> 02:14:03,020
pulls me in.

1566
02:14:03,020 --> 02:14:07,020
I'll... I'll... I'll probably fall asleep.

1567
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:11,020
If I'm honest. I'll probably fall asleep.

1568
02:14:11,020 --> 02:14:15,020
I'll probably fall asleep.

1569
02:14:15,020 --> 02:14:19,020
If it's like long winded speech plays

1570
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:23,020
like where they're just talking. I'll probably fall asleep. I usually wake up

1571
02:14:23,020 --> 02:14:27,020
but I used to go to plays a lot and I would wake up when they start singing.

1572
02:14:27,020 --> 02:14:31,020
It would always be when they're singing where I will wake up.

1573
02:14:31,020 --> 02:14:35,020
When the moment they start like, she did this. What?

1574
02:14:35,020 --> 02:14:39,020
Oh my god. And then I'm just like...

1575
02:14:49,020 --> 02:14:53,020
But if it's all music? Probably. I'll probably pay attention to it.

1576
02:14:53,020 --> 02:14:57,020
I've seen Hamilton before I believe.

1577
02:14:57,020 --> 02:15:01,020
So yeah.

1578
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:05,020
If it's all music I'll probably... I'll probably

1579
02:15:05,020 --> 02:15:09,020
have a good watch. A good listen.

1580
02:15:09,020 --> 02:15:13,020
Because I can clap along like, yay!

1581
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:17,020
Yay!

1582
02:15:17,020 --> 02:15:21,020
And if it's a song I know, I'll sing along.

1583
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:31,020
Okay.

1584
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:51,020
I don't know what that was.

1585
02:15:51,020 --> 02:15:55,020
Are there more slides?

1586
02:15:55,020 --> 02:15:59,020
Yeah. I was going to go over the goals again

1587
02:15:59,020 --> 02:16:03,020
but we already did that and we ignored that.

1588
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:07,020
Oh yeah! Oh my god!

1589
02:16:15,020 --> 02:16:19,020
Oh my god I can believe we forgot!

1590
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:23,020
I...

1591
02:16:23,020 --> 02:16:27,020
I...

1592
02:16:27,020 --> 02:16:31,020
I...

1593
02:16:31,020 --> 02:16:35,020
I'm so sorry. I'm just going so fast

1594
02:16:35,020 --> 02:16:39,020
and I... I... I...

1595
02:16:39,020 --> 02:16:43,020
I'm so sorry. I'm so distracted.

1596
02:16:43,020 --> 02:16:47,020
Mama forgot. Yeah, she forgot.

1597
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:51,020
I had some ideas

1598
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:55,020
for some tags so I had some. And I wanted to see

1599
02:16:55,020 --> 02:16:59,020
if you guys could come up with some as we went. So if any of you had

1600
02:16:59,020 --> 02:17:03,020
like...

1601
02:17:03,020 --> 02:17:07,020
some ideas for live and clips and memes

1602
02:17:07,020 --> 02:17:11,020
we could add them.

1603
02:17:17,020 --> 02:17:21,020
Whoa!

1604
02:17:25,020 --> 02:17:29,020
Let me try and not like open this right now.

1605
02:17:29,020 --> 02:17:33,020

Oh no. Do lay laughs. Do lay laughs.

1612
02:17:57,020 --> 02:18:01,020
Sounds very exotic.

1613
02:18:01,020 --> 02:18:05,020
Do lay laughs.

1614
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:09,020
Was it trying to trick my eyebrows?

1615
02:18:09,020 --> 02:18:13,020
Eyebrows moving too fast.

1616
02:18:13,020 --> 02:18:17,020

Okay.

1632
02:19:23,020 --> 02:19:27,020
Okay.

1633
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:31,020
My brain is slow, make this up.

1634
02:19:31,020 --> 02:19:35,020
Oh here we go. Let's grow up down.

1635
02:19:35,020 --> 02:19:39,020

Sorry, was I praying? Oh, I'm sorry.

How do you do a poll? I want to do a poll. How do you do a poll?

1645
02:20:15,020 --> 02:20:19,020
For the live. Which live hashtag you guys want?

02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:23,020
Asu live or do a live? Are you doing a poll? I'm not useless. How do you do a poll?

How do you make poll? I got you. Don't worry.

1651
02:20:39,020 --> 02:20:43,020
I'm smart. I got this. I'm intelligent.

1652
02:20:43,020 --> 02:20:47,020
I'm intelligent.

1653
02:20:47,020 --> 02:20:51,020
I found it. I'm smart.

1654
02:20:51,020 --> 02:20:55,020
Which live

1655
02:20:55,020 --> 02:20:59,020
tag. Watch the mark.

1656
02:20:59,020 --> 02:21:03,020
Asu live

1657
02:21:03,020 --> 02:21:07,020
or do a live

1658
02:21:07,020 --> 02:21:11,020
like that. Am I smart or what?

1659
02:21:11,020 --> 02:21:15,020
Hell yeah. That's right. I'm intelligent.

1660
02:21:15,020 --> 02:21:19,020
I'm so smart.

1661
02:21:19,020 --> 02:21:23,020
Ha ha ha.

1662
02:21:23,020 --> 02:21:27,020
I'm intelligent. I'm smart.

1663
02:21:27,020 --> 02:21:31,020
That's right.

1664
02:21:31,020 --> 02:21:35,020
I'm smart. I'm actually smart.

1665
02:21:39,020 --> 02:21:43,020
And then it goes out like that.

1666
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:47,020
Yay. I did it.

1667
02:21:47,020 --> 02:21:51,020
I mean, I knew this from the start. I knew how to do this.

1668
02:21:51,020 --> 02:21:55,020
I was just pulling your leg.

1669
02:22:01,020 --> 02:22:05,020
That's right.

1670
02:22:05,020 --> 02:22:09,020
That's right. I'm smart. I'm intelligent.

1671
02:22:09,020 --> 02:22:13,020
Ha ha ha.

1672
02:22:13,020 --> 02:22:17,020
Ha ha ha.

1673
02:22:17,020 --> 02:22:21,020
Ha ha ha.

1674
02:22:21,020 --> 02:22:25,020
Ha ha ha.

1675
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:29,020
Ha ha ha.

1676
02:22:29,020 --> 02:22:43,420
when does the pole end? does it end by itself?

1677
02:22:43,420 --> 02:22:53,420
when does the pole end? wait, end it?

1678
02:22:53,420 --> 02:22:59,420
oh, I have to end it!

1679
02:22:59,420 --> 02:23:11,420
oh, okay, okay, I think everyone's voted so far, right?

1680
02:23:11,420 --> 02:23:15,420
there's more votes, so many more votes coming in

1681
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:21,420
but I think it's pretty clear which one won though

1682
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:41,420
and we end the pole, and the one that won

1683
02:23:41,420 --> 02:23:47,420
asal lives! asal life won!

1684
02:23:47,420 --> 02:23:51,420
alright, so we're gonna add that in here

1685
02:23:51,420 --> 02:23:57,420
stop it, please, come on, work for me

1686
02:23:57,420 --> 02:23:59,420
won't do me like that

1687
02:23:59,420 --> 02:24:01,420
alright, here we go, yeah, that's right

1688
02:24:01,420 --> 02:24:03,420
that's what I'm talking about

1689
02:24:03,420 --> 02:24:13,420
asal lives!

1690
02:24:13,420 --> 02:24:19,420
is it being used of fudge?

1691
02:24:19,420 --> 02:24:21,420
we gotta come up with something else then

1692
02:24:21,420 --> 02:24:25,420
let me check

1693
02:24:25,420 --> 02:24:29,420
no, we're gonna steal someone else's house tag

1694
02:24:29,420 --> 02:24:33,420
asal life

1695
02:24:33,420 --> 02:24:35,420
yeah, that belongs to someone

1696
02:24:35,420 --> 02:24:37,420
a couple of people actually

1697
02:24:37,420 --> 02:24:43,420
there's a few people who use the same one

1698
02:24:43,420 --> 02:24:51,420
not just one person, but it looks like they took it over

1699
02:24:51,420 --> 02:24:53,420
yeah, that's fine

1700
02:24:53,420 --> 02:24:57,420
alright, so I guess we have to use doolive

1701
02:24:57,420 --> 02:25:01,420
the doolive it is

1702
02:25:01,420 --> 02:25:05,420
we'll check it right now

1703
02:25:05,420 --> 02:25:09,420
a paxry boys

1704
02:25:09,420 --> 02:25:13,420
I went to go look it up real fast, and all I saw was paxry boys

1705
02:25:13,420 --> 02:25:17,420
that's funny

1706
02:25:17,420 --> 02:25:21,420
is that like an event?

1707
02:25:21,420 --> 02:25:33,420
like some sort of event?

1708
02:25:33,420 --> 02:25:37,420
oh my, I mean, I'm sure this event has other tags

1709
02:25:37,420 --> 02:25:45,420
they don't need this tag

1710
02:25:45,420 --> 02:25:49,420
oh yeah, this is really old, it was very long ago

1711
02:25:49,420 --> 02:25:53,420
it doesn't look

1712
02:25:53,420 --> 02:25:59,420
but like it's been used recently

1713
02:25:59,420 --> 02:26:05,420
so, I think we're free

1714
02:26:05,420 --> 02:26:07,420
free to use doolive

1715
02:26:07,420 --> 02:26:09,420
alright, doolive it is

1716
02:26:09,420 --> 02:26:17,420
next we'll do the next one

1717
02:26:17,420 --> 02:26:23,420
we have the clips, which is the daily doolay

1718
02:26:23,420 --> 02:26:29,420
I have daily doolay

1719
02:26:29,420 --> 02:26:35,420
and what else?

1720
02:26:35,420 --> 02:26:39,420
I have daily doolay

1721
02:26:39,420 --> 02:26:41,420
what was it?

1722
02:26:41,420 --> 02:26:55,420
or your other ideas for our clips?

1723
02:26:55,420 --> 02:26:59,420
milky moments, no, I don't think I can use that

1724
02:26:59,420 --> 02:27:03,420
there are other creators with that name

1725
02:27:03,420 --> 02:27:07,420
so I don't want to

1726
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:11,420
take that

1727
02:27:11,420 --> 02:27:17,420
azuclips

1728
02:27:17,420 --> 02:27:23,420
sounds nice, I like that

1729
02:27:23,420 --> 02:27:25,420
I don't think I should use anything with goat in it

1730
02:27:25,420 --> 02:27:31,420
because there's like a bunch of other, you know, goats like myself

1731
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:35,420
so, very sure

1732
02:27:35,420 --> 02:27:39,420
I want it to be like

1733
02:27:39,420 --> 02:27:43,420
kind of obvious it's mine

1734
02:27:43,420 --> 02:27:47,420
that's our goat

1735
02:27:55,420 --> 02:27:57,420
doolay clips

1736
02:27:57,420 --> 02:27:59,420
I'll add a third option

1737
02:27:59,420 --> 02:28:09,420
and I think that's the last one and you guys will have to pick from that, okay?

1738
02:28:09,420 --> 02:28:13,420
alright, starting pull now

1739
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:15,420
which ones do you like?

1740
02:28:15,420 --> 02:28:17,420
which ones do you want?

1741
02:28:17,420 --> 02:28:19,420
which ones do you like?

1742
02:28:19,420 --> 02:28:23,420
my nose is itchy

1743
02:28:27,420 --> 02:28:31,420
scratch, scratch, scratch

1744
02:28:43,420 --> 02:28:45,420
I'll wait a little bit

1745
02:28:45,420 --> 02:28:49,420
little bit, little bit

1746
02:28:49,420 --> 02:28:53,420
scratch, scratch, scratch

1747
02:29:13,420 --> 02:29:17,420
and I think that

1748
02:29:17,420 --> 02:29:19,420
50, 50

1749
02:29:19,420 --> 02:29:23,420
it's like at a hard 50

1750
02:29:23,420 --> 02:29:25,420
let's count down from 3

1751
02:29:25,420 --> 02:29:31,420
3, 2, 1

1752
02:29:31,420 --> 02:29:35,420
and 0, we end the pull

1753
02:29:43,420 --> 02:29:45,420
what, 1?

1754
02:29:45,420 --> 02:29:49,420
it was no 50, I was wrong, I was off

1755
02:29:49,420 --> 02:29:55,420
it only showed me 1

1756
02:29:55,420 --> 02:29:57,420
doolay, daily doolay

1757
02:29:57,420 --> 02:29:59,420

02:30:11,420 --> 02:30:13,420

1769
02:30:41,420 --> 02:30:45,420

I

1863
02:40:51,540 --> 02:40:57,660
Yeah, for corn for clips by Azura for for me that's a good idea

1864
02:40:58,660 --> 02:41:00,660
What do we have for clips again?

1865
02:41:03,300 --> 02:41:07,100
Daily delay well daily delay for clips

1866
02:41:23,940 --> 02:41:25,940
Daily delay

1867
02:41:28,660 --> 02:41:30,660
Okay, so

1868
02:41:34,940 --> 02:41:36,940
Hey, so

1869
02:41:37,060 --> 02:41:38,540

see

1871
02:41:40,020 --> 02:41:43,340
By Azura we can leave yapper

1872
02:41:43,940 --> 02:41:49,100
We can leave by Azura as the meme since I see everyone seems to agree with this

1873
02:41:49,900 --> 02:41:53,420
Everyone's like that more we're gonna do yapper corn versus

1874
02:41:54,420 --> 02:41:56,420
Daily delay

1875
02:41:58,180 --> 02:42:00,620
Okay, how's that?

1876
02:42:03,020 --> 02:42:07,540
Everyone's happy with that we're gonna vote on this one

Yes

1879
02:42:19,820 --> 02:42:21,820
The people have chosen

1880
02:42:22,820 --> 02:42:28,980
And your goddess wills what she wants

1881
02:42:37,860 --> 02:42:41,140
And I think there should be a second poll

1882
02:42:51,940 --> 02:42:56,160
It's either it's either you guys pick it for like we don't have a lot

1883
02:43:03,660 --> 02:43:09,060
Do you want yapper corn for the live or do you guys want it for the

1884
02:43:21,980 --> 02:43:23,980
For the

1885
02:43:25,500 --> 02:43:27,500

1900
02:44:39,340 --> 02:44:41,500
Yapper corn for life

1911
02:46:08,380 --> 02:46:10,380
It's great

1912
02:46:10,380 --> 02:46:12,380

1914
02:46:41,340 --> 02:46:46,380

02:47:04,940 --> 02:47:06,940
You're elder scroll

1918
02:47:08,940 --> 02:47:13,340
Scrolls, but I don't think we should call ourselves that. I hear it call yourself

1919
02:47:13,900 --> 02:47:17,740
It's cute. I love it, but we can keep it for like a inside joke. How's that?

1920
02:47:19,020 --> 02:47:21,020
Hmm, how's that?

1921
02:47:21,420 --> 02:47:28,540
And I can address you as adoring fans every now and then. All right, how's that keep that between us?

1922
02:47:28,780 --> 02:47:30,780
Okay

1923
02:47:55,020 --> 02:47:57,020
Yes

1924
02:47:58,540 --> 02:48:02,740
Good. I'm happy. I'm happy you're great, and

1925
02:48:06,100 --> 02:48:08,100
And that's it for that

1926
02:48:09,620 --> 02:48:11,620
And I think that's it I

1927
02:48:12,340 --> 02:48:14,340
Think we went over

1928
02:48:14,340 --> 02:48:20,060
Pretty much everything and then I just had these I wanted to just go over some of these and then that was it

1929
02:48:20,580 --> 02:48:22,580
We're good

1930
02:48:23,300 --> 02:48:25,300
We did it we made it through the slides

1931
02:48:26,100 --> 02:48:28,100
We did it

1932
02:48:32,340 --> 02:48:34,340
Yay

1933
02:48:40,300 --> 02:48:42,300
We did it

1934
02:48:55,300 --> 02:48:57,300
I

1935
02:49:12,740 --> 02:49:19,580
Picked out some morals, but I I'm praying

1936
02:49:19,580 --> 02:49:21,580
I

1937
02:49:24,340 --> 02:49:26,340
Properly filtered something

1938
02:49:36,580 --> 02:49:38,580
Let's go through this

1939
02:49:49,580 --> 02:49:55,060
We do that you're smart you're so smart you're so smart

1940
02:50:20,420 --> 02:50:25,020
Oh, that's not this one's not too bad

1941
02:50:33,660 --> 02:50:35,660
This is fine

1942
02:50:38,180 --> 02:50:40,180
I swear that's already in here it is

1943
02:50:50,340 --> 02:50:52,340
Yeah

1944
02:51:05,060 --> 02:51:07,060
Wow

1945
02:51:07,940 --> 02:51:12,100
So congratulations on your day feels as well

1946
02:51:12,460 --> 02:51:18,540
My question is in your opinion after working with VLOR for some time now

1947
02:51:18,700 --> 02:51:20,700
How would you describe their management?

1948
02:51:21,260 --> 02:51:25,140
They asked me if I could not ignore it. I say management is awesome

1949
02:51:26,620 --> 02:51:30,140
They work really hard to get everyone's stuff done and they

1950
02:51:31,220 --> 02:51:35,900
Get it done very quickly, and I think it's that's pretty cool, and they're very

1951
02:51:36,940 --> 02:51:38,940
How do you say?

1952
02:51:39,380 --> 02:51:41,020
understanding

1953
02:51:41,060 --> 02:51:43,060
very understanding and I

1954
02:51:43,660 --> 02:51:49,260
Appreciate that. I feel very welcomed and wanted and I really love it here already

1955
02:51:49,260 --> 02:51:52,860
And I hope it will continue to be the best

1956
02:51:53,620 --> 02:51:55,620
experience it can be

1957
02:51:56,300 --> 02:51:59,700
So far so please I really love this

1958
02:52:01,100 --> 02:52:03,100
Company so much already

1959
02:52:04,100 --> 02:52:11,140
I mean son has been very helpful the manager son has been very very very helpful and very good at what they do

1960
02:52:16,540 --> 02:52:20,820
All my mistakes were on me if I'm really honest I did make a

1961
02:52:21,260 --> 02:52:26,820
Trying to like fix stuff at PC issues. I had so many issues going on

1962
02:52:27,740 --> 02:52:32,460
The person who helped me out with all of that was means and manager

1963
02:52:34,100 --> 02:52:37,860
Manager help me out so much with everything so

1964
02:52:40,300 --> 02:52:42,300
I'm not a very tech savvy

1965
02:52:43,220 --> 02:52:45,220
so I

1966
02:52:45,980 --> 02:52:48,820
Appreciate that that hope that I got it was very necessary

1967
02:52:51,540 --> 02:52:53,820
So yeah, that's all I feel

1968
02:52:57,460 --> 02:52:59,460
The next question

1969
02:52:59,980 --> 02:53:01,980
Hello, that's debut

1970
02:53:03,180 --> 02:53:10,020
My question is have you met your gen maids in your life or have you only the chance to meet them online?

1971
02:53:10,340 --> 02:53:13,980
Also, what is your first impression on them? I've given my impression on them

1972
02:53:14,820 --> 02:53:17,460
very shortly during the deal and I

1973
02:53:18,460 --> 02:53:20,460
Really love them so much

1974
02:53:20,660 --> 02:53:22,660
They make me feel very

1975
02:53:24,100 --> 02:53:26,100
At home

1976
02:53:26,740 --> 02:53:27,900
I

1977
02:53:27,900 --> 02:53:31,780
Do get kind of nervous around them, and I've heard that I'm quite

1978
02:53:32,540 --> 02:53:41,820
Intimidating so I hope that we can warm up even more as time goes and we've done played games together already

1979
02:53:43,220 --> 02:53:49,460
Thank you saying I was really good at the game, but I just I don't know I I I I was just

1980
02:53:50,340 --> 02:53:53,020
Normally playing said games and enjoying it

1981
02:53:53,020 --> 02:53:55,020
So

1982
02:53:56,380 --> 02:54:00,540
I'm just very observant and I like to like pick out things I see it

1983
02:54:24,020 --> 02:54:25,020
I

1984
02:54:25,020 --> 02:54:31,420
Hopefully we'll warm up a little more and no I have not met them in real life yet, but maybe one day we will

1985
02:54:33,580 --> 02:54:35,580
And I hope that

1986
02:54:35,940 --> 02:54:39,460
That comes to the past and I really do want to meet my gen maids

1987
02:54:39,460 --> 02:54:44,820
I think it'd be really fun like going to conventions or cons together our events and stuff as

1988
02:54:45,620 --> 02:54:47,620
us

1989
02:54:48,780 --> 02:54:50,780
As me

1990
02:54:51,660 --> 02:54:59,620
And stuff like that and maybe even stream like in person together. That'd be fun, but yeah, I think what

1991
02:54:59,620 --> 02:55:01,620
And

1992
02:55:15,380 --> 02:55:18,900
Okay, I wouldn't be a surprised if you're getting other

1993
02:55:22,660 --> 02:55:24,660
So here's something

1994
02:55:24,660 --> 02:55:31,220
I would love comfort sleep ASMR just coming breathing heartbeat, maybe some comforting speech for me, you know, whatever

1995
02:55:31,860 --> 02:55:33,860
I just like the idea

1996
02:55:35,980 --> 02:55:40,020
Interaction so far. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to the baby. Oh

1997
02:55:41,220 --> 02:55:42,620
What's to come?

1998
02:55:42,620 --> 02:55:46,140
Yes, actually, this is something that I've always wanted to do

1999
02:55:46,140 --> 02:55:50,820
I think I've mentioned it in the debut where I said I wanted to do sleep ASMR

2000
02:55:51,820 --> 02:55:57,800
He obeyed or I either sing you a lullaby read you a bedtime story or like just

2001
02:55:58,380 --> 02:56:04,700
Babble to you about something and comfort you like it's okay. You could sleep. It's fine

2002
02:56:05,820 --> 02:56:13,060
Nina little head pad. I've had your head with some ASMR sounds of me cuddling or petting you

2003
02:56:13,500 --> 02:56:18,060
Things like that, you know and healthy sleep. I wanted to do things like like that

2004
02:56:21,780 --> 02:56:28,300
The heartbeat breathing all of that all of it. I want to do all of that comfort comfort ASMR

2005
02:56:33,820 --> 02:56:39,620
So I want to just bring that up so I that you all know what kind of content to expect from me

2006
02:56:39,620 --> 02:56:41,300
Maybe in the future

2007
02:56:41,300 --> 02:56:46,540
But the majority of the time is yes, I am a gamer. I am a gamer. I play a lot of games. I

2008
02:56:48,100 --> 02:56:50,100
Don't think I'll

2009
02:56:51,820 --> 02:56:53,820
Don't think I'll be

2010
02:56:58,700 --> 02:57:03,540
Streaming a lot of league League of Legends. Yes, I said I like league and yes

2011
02:57:03,540 --> 02:57:08,500
I said I like playing league, but do not expect me to play league. Um, I

2012
02:57:08,940 --> 02:57:10,940
Don't think I'm going to play it

2013
02:57:14,740 --> 02:57:16,740
So yeah

2014
02:57:17,420 --> 02:57:21,900
So I brought up league early, but I forgot to mention that I wasn't gonna play it

2015
02:57:25,100 --> 02:57:30,900
There might be a random time when like if I have free time and I have a and I do a random morning

2016
02:57:30,900 --> 02:57:38,100
Stream that I plan at the time or something if it's a morning stream. Oh, I probably might be bored and

2017
02:57:39,300 --> 02:57:45,860
Choose to stream some league just like hey, there's a random league stream if anyone wants to come you're free to come

2018
02:57:45,860 --> 02:57:48,740
It's fine. I understand a lot of people don't like league, but

2019
02:57:51,460 --> 02:57:55,860
League is my comfort game league is a game that I actually enjoy that helps me like

2020
02:57:57,140 --> 02:58:03,140
With racing thoughts. So I play league. I don't have to stream it. I could play it off stream

2021
02:58:03,860 --> 02:58:05,860
So it doesn't need to be streamed

2022
02:58:07,940 --> 02:58:09,940
It's just uh

2023
02:58:09,940 --> 02:58:14,580
A thing that I like to play and I thought that sharing my interest is better than um

2024
02:58:15,460 --> 02:58:17,460
Just you know, yeah

2025
02:58:20,420 --> 02:58:24,820
Everyone has a comfort game. I hear some people have apex legends as their comfort game

2026
02:58:25,140 --> 02:58:29,860
People have shooting games of their comfort game. I can have mine. Come on. Come on

2027
02:58:30,740 --> 02:58:32,740
Come on

2028
02:58:34,580 --> 02:58:36,580
League isn't that bad

2029
02:58:37,540 --> 02:58:39,540
I

2030
02:58:42,580 --> 02:58:47,220
Understand their concerns of how Lee can be a bit not comforting

2031
02:58:56,340 --> 02:59:01,380
Worry odds that you will do a total gen one collab like all of us collabing together

2032
02:59:01,940 --> 02:59:03,940
There's a high chance for that

2033
02:59:04,580 --> 02:59:06,580
It's pretty high

2034
02:59:07,620 --> 02:59:13,140
I thought we would never not do it. So all of us clubbing together. Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty high

2035
02:59:14,500 --> 02:59:16,500
It's pretty pretty it's pretty pretty high

2036
02:59:23,540 --> 02:59:27,860
Technically, yeah, technically, I'll redone one. Yeah, right. It has happened before. Yeah

2037
02:59:29,860 --> 02:59:31,860
It's pretty high

2038
02:59:32,580 --> 02:59:34,580
Um, and we have

2039
02:59:36,260 --> 02:59:40,980
This one's not that bad, right? It's not that bad. I'm not that bad. It's not that bad, all right

2040
02:59:41,540 --> 02:59:45,060
Well, mommy enjoys being a sub too, right? I'm sort of being a sub

2041
02:59:47,460 --> 02:59:49,460
Encouraging, you know

2042
02:59:49,780 --> 02:59:51,780
Though I have bad kids so sometimes

2043
02:59:52,420 --> 02:59:55,140
I already mentioned this before that. Yes

2044
02:59:56,500 --> 03:00:00,900
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I cater to quite a lot of things and

2045
03:00:01,540 --> 03:00:03,540
You should expect both

2046
03:00:04,340 --> 03:00:06,340
So not at all

2047
03:00:21,060 --> 03:00:25,780
She been everyone and Emmy and everyone has been talking about what they want to do and the things that they will do

2048
03:00:26,420 --> 03:00:27,540
um

2049
03:00:27,540 --> 03:00:29,540
That's fine. I don't mind

2050
03:00:30,260 --> 03:00:32,260
Uh it at all. Um

2051
03:00:32,900 --> 03:00:34,900
I'm going to do what I like regardless

2052
03:00:35,220 --> 03:00:37,220
um, and that has always been my plan

2053
03:00:37,540 --> 03:00:42,420
And I do not mind. I'm fine with that. It's perfectly fine. Um

2054
03:00:44,100 --> 03:00:48,820
Besides, I think I already fit the vibes already. So I don't think that's a problem

2055
03:00:49,700 --> 03:00:51,700
Oh

2056
03:00:55,940 --> 03:00:59,940
And do I prefer mama or mommy, I think I mentioned this in a tweet

2057
03:01:00,420 --> 03:01:02,420
Uh, I

2058
03:01:02,500 --> 03:01:04,500
They both sound good

2059
03:01:04,500 --> 03:01:06,500
I like mama asu

2060
03:01:06,500 --> 03:01:08,500
But I don't mind being called mommy

2061
03:01:08,820 --> 03:01:10,820
so

2062
03:01:11,060 --> 03:01:13,060
Yeah

2063
03:01:13,780 --> 03:01:16,980
Yeah, I don't mind. I thought I just bring it up here

2064
03:01:19,220 --> 03:01:21,220
I

2065
03:01:26,740 --> 03:01:31,380
How do you like your coffee with lots of sugar and milk or cream

2066
03:01:32,100 --> 03:01:37,700
Of vanilla cream. Actually, I like it sweet. I don't like it dark

2067
03:01:38,420 --> 03:01:44,180
How do you call it black? Thank you for coffee. I like, uh, really sweet milky coffee

2068
03:01:44,660 --> 03:01:48,100
Mm-hmm. I would put like at least three

2069
03:01:57,140 --> 03:01:59,940
That is my alarm

2070
03:02:01,060 --> 03:02:08,500
For me to take my medication. Yay medication and it is also 11. So um, I believe

2071
03:02:09,460 --> 03:02:16,020
Marcy should be going live soon and we'll be reading it to her very soon. So

2072
03:02:17,060 --> 03:02:20,580
We'll gather around the campfire and get ready for our Marcy's ring

2073
03:02:20,580 --> 03:02:22,580
And

2074
03:02:34,100 --> 03:02:35,620
So I am

2075
03:02:35,620 --> 03:02:37,620
And then the last one was the same thing

2076
03:02:37,620 --> 03:02:41,700
I think had a question of the plans of the asmr content streams

2077
03:02:42,100 --> 03:02:44,100
