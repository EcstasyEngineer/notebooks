466680	472680	I'm already like in a little bit of pain so I took an electric bike
474840	478840	To the to the store yeah
480040	482040	To get to the store
487720	490780	You guys you guys
490780	492780	I
496220	500540	I ate you I ate it I ate it I ate it hard
501500	503500	I ate it
520460	526620	I fell so hard my legs was twisted in between the bike
527420	534300	I I was laying on the ground for like a minute that a bunch of people crowded around me to see if I was alive
543020	547900	It was bad, but I'm fine. Don't worry. I'm fine now. Don't worry
557580	565660	No, I didn't land on my face thankfully I put my hands out in front of me
566380	567660	um
567660	569660	I don't know what happened like
570220	573740	the wheel like just went out of control and then
574620	577180	Uh, I think I hit something because I felt a bump
578060	580060	and the wheel just started like
580860	586220	Wiggling out of control and no matter how much I turned the steering at the top
586620	588620	To get it straight it wouldn't go straight
589660	591660	And it was over. I knew it was over
594620	599420	I I I bit my tongue and I just said oh well is that goodbye everybody
604860	606860	And I and I fell I ate it
609500	611500	Yeah
612380	620940	Um, I hurt like my whole left side um pretty bad
623580	627980	During that entire ASMR stream I was in a lot of pain
630860	634700	Only one of you guys to worry so I was like I'll tell them tomorrow
636140	640380	I'll tell them tomorrow. Stoney was like you should cancel stream
641660	644940	No, that's fine. It's fine. Everything's okay
646140	648620	So currently my leg is a little swollen
649180	652460	I hit my shoulder my elbow
653340	657660	And my all on my left side and my right but she kind of hurt
658060	660060	I
666860	673580	You died of embarrassment. No, I was fine. I was it's it's crazy because I expected people to laugh
674060	678700	If someone would have started laughing then I'd probably be embarrassed, but no
679420	683020	No one laughed. I think they were very concerned. I really think they thought I was
683820	685820	Not a single person laughed
693020	697420	So I have like ice on it right now. I've had ice on it since yesterday and
698460	701020	And my whole body is so sore
703180	709580	I think I like flipped I don't know. I think I like flipped I think I like flipped I think I like flipped
710380	716380	I think I like flipped I don't even know how I ended up on my back because I fell forward
716860	721260	So I think I flipped like I did a roller some side some type of something
721740	724860	Because I fell forward with my hands out
725500	729580	Slid on my hands and then somehow ended up on my back
731580	733580	And I just laid there for a minute
739900	741900	I
744700	749820	Survive another to another day I'll live I'll be fine. It's nothing worse than
751260	753260	Other incidents I had
754300	757100	I had incidents where my finger got jammed in a
758380	760380	In a safe
760380	762060	Uh
762060	764060	Was an accident
765500	767500	Finger got slammed in it
768460	770460	Big big heavy metal safe
771260	773260	I split my finger
773260	774620	Finger
774620	776620	In two
777340	781340	I've had worse injuries right that's that's fine that
782060	785020	It was fine. It's perfectly fine
785740	789020	I think that's one of the worst injuries I had
789900	792780	Was the finger thing and I've had various others
793660	794700	but
794700	795740	so
795820	800060	There was no need for me to go to a doctor. It's fine as long as the bruise didn't turn like
800860	802620	Colors and
802620	805420	And that would be fine if it was like black and blue
806140	809660	Then maybe I would have maybe I would have to go see a doctor
809820	816620	But the skin tone and everything nothing changed just a big giant bump with the little bruise on the top
820220	824540	I got a little bump on my my forehead, but I'm very sure I didn't land on my head
825500	827980	So maybe something hit me there, but I don't know
829900	831900	But I'm fine
839900	843340	Did I do a backflip? I think it was a front flip. I think that's what you call a front flip
849180	851500	Maybe a backflip. I don't know. I don't remember
852300	854860	I only remember making sure I didn't want to land on my head
855660	859820	I had to protect my head at all costs. I did not have a helmet on so
861420	868860	My my head was my main my head and neck was my main concern when I fell so I made sure to fall on the way I didn't land on my head
870460	876380	So everyone remember to wear a helmet ride safely. It doesn't matter how slow you're going
877420	879920	Wear a helmet wear a helmet
880880	886080	It doesn't matter how slow you're going. You can move like a snail. It does not matter
896800	904240	Stay safe. Do not do what I did. I was unsafe even though I know I can easily get injured. I was
907040	909040	Don't do what I did
909920	911920	I
922000	925520	I'm good. Don't worry. I'm fine. Don't worry about me though. Okay. I'm fine
926160	930320	I can laugh about it now. I was laughing about it then. I was literally laughing when I fell
931440	935280	Everyone came over and they were like, are you okay? And I just gave them a thumbs up like
937120	939120	Just a big old thumbs up
940320	942320	I
943840	945840	Always wear protection
946640	948240	When riding a bike
948240	950800	Yes, or riding any feel-good
951680	953680	um that that doesn't
954480	957120	Required you to be inside of it like a
958000	964000	Even even then even inside of a like a race car. You still wear a helmet because you're going really fast
965120	967120	Yeah
967920	969920	Yeah
976080	980560	No, don't be worried. I'm fine. I'm fine. I promise. I promise
981600	985680	I'm just healing now. It's all that matters. It's a little bit of healing
986800	988800	I took some pink color so
989520	991520	Soon I will kick in and I'll be fine
991840	997440	I just want to chat it up with you guys. I told you about what happened yesterday
1001040	1003760	I wanted to stream a little longer
1004480	1006480	Yesterday, but I was like

1354080	1356080	During the uh
1358160	1362160	I am still new to the uh the audio stuff
1363360	1364400	as um
1364400	1365280	I
1365280	1368880	I have been using really bad equipment a while back
1369440	1371600	So I'm not used to the
1372320	1373360	this
1373360	1377120	equipment uh sharoni had helped me get um so
1378480	1380480	I'm still learning how to use it
1381120	1387440	And uh man sound has been helping with uh with it a lot uh so
1388320	1392720	And now it's just up to me to really figure out how a majority of it work
1393440	1396480	Since microphones are very different from each other
1397920	1401040	Asmr microphone picks up everything
1402560	1406720	Every single sound so I had a filter on it, but

1726560	1728240	Oh, yeah
1728320	1730320	I also did want to mention that I uh
1732160	1735360	Want to do more asmrs, but we're probably gonna have to
1737200	1741360	Tone it down because our cookie eating was too much for youtube
1742240	1743600	so
1743600	1745760	We're gonna have to tone down the cookie eating
1747840	1749840	And and stick to just some brushing
1751120	1754240	some brazes and requests and stuff
1754320	1756320	I
1757520	1761360	And some milk pouring I like doing the milk pouring that was pretty fun
1764320	1768720	We can test a few limits, but sadly
1785040	1787040	All right
1803440	1805440	Yes, I only say I agree
1814880	1816880	Um
1817440	1820720	We're gonna get started on the one shot
1824560	1826560	I had a really good sleep
1829760	1832160	Last last night, so I'm really like
1837040	1839840	Still feeling the effects of the heart
1844240	1846240	So
1858960	1860960	Can you hear that is or is it too loud
1870240	1873120	What does that sound you ask what is that sound
1874560	1879120	Do you really want to know you want to know what that sound is?
1898640	1900640	Yeah
1900880	1902880	Do you want to know
1907280	1909280	Well, that sound is
1912880	1914880	One shot
1918800	1920800	One shot
1922320	1924320	The game is a block

2001300	2005300	Yes, yes. Yeah, one of my favourites.
2005300	2009300	I never really think about a favourite game.
2009300	2013300	I play it and I go, I like this.
2013300	2016300	And then I move on.
2016300	2020300	I like this. This is nice.

2099040	2103040	dedicated to our beloved friend Felix.
2103040	2105040	Let me rest in peace.
2109040	2112040	I'm not going to remember any of this, by the way.
2113040	2115040	Arrows.
2117040	2119040	Arrows.
2127040	2131040	So it's only keyboard, no mouse.

2139040	2141040	Examines z.
2141040	2143040	X to Council.
2143040	2145040	Array.
2145040	2147040	Walk faster, shift.
2151040	2153040	A for Ming and Bra.
2155040	2157040	S for M for Bra.
2159040	2161040	S for C.
2164040	2167040	I'm not going to remember any of this.
2167040	2169040	Let's get started.
2171040	2175040	Explore and interact with the environment and characters.
2175040	2177040	Sometimes you may find an item.
2177040	2179040	Once you have picked up an item,
2179040	2183040	you may select it from your inventory.
2183040	2189040	When the item is active, you can either combine it with other items in the inventory
2189040	2193040	or use it at certain locations in order to progress.
2197040	2199040	Array.
2201040	2207040	I played this game like really really really really really long time ago.
2207040	2209040	So I remember nothing.
2211040	2215040	Maybe like some things here and there.
2215040	2219040	Uh, I don't remember.
2225040	2227040	A proven broad.
2231040	2233040	Uh.
2233040	2247040	Although full screen is an option, the game is best experienced in window mode.
2247040	2253040	Really? How do you exit window mode? I mean how do you exit full screen mode?
2257040	2259040	Oh.
2259040	2261040	Oh.
2261040	2265040	But it's so little I can't see.
2267040	2269040	It's so little.
2269040	2271040	It's so tiny.
2283040	2285040	Glasses?
2287040	2289040	I have glasses.
2289040	2291040	I got reading glasses.
2307040	2309040	No, it won't let you resize it.
2313040	2315040	It's so tiny.
2315040	2317040	It's so little.
2317040	2319040	Small.
2325040	2327040	I'm making it big and there's no way.
2327040	2329040	There's no way I can see.
2347040	2349040	Okay.
2351040	2353040	I love the green man.
2353040	2355040	The green man is a really good anime.
2355040	2357040	One of my favorites actually.
2357040	2359040	One of my favorites.
2359040	2361040	I have many favorites.
2371040	2373040	Okay.
2373040	2375040	This is fine.
2375040	2379040	I might try to move this over here.
2379040	2381040	Oh, my shoulder.
2389040	2391040	We're fine.
2391040	2393040	Everything's fine.
2405040	2407040	Hmm.
2411040	2413040	Hello there.
2413040	2415040	Hello?
2417040	2419040	Hello there.
2423040	2425040	Oh.
2427040	2429040	I'm giving up.
2431040	2433040	In what password?
2433040	2435040	Access denied.
2439040	2441040	Dusty books.
2441040	2443040	That's too dark to read in here.
2445040	2449040	The soft glowing light trickles through the window.
2449040	2451040	What's this?
2451040	2453040	It's even out here.
2453040	2455040	Niko picks up the door.
2455040	2457040	What's in here?
2463040	2465040	Door's locked.
2469040	2471040	Door's locked.
2479040	2481040	Hiya.
2483040	2485040	Oh, terrible.
2485040	2487040	No.
2491040	2495040	I don't know what we do at the senior level.
2507040	2509040	Okay.
2511040	2513040	What the?
2513040	2515040	Hello?
2515040	2517040	Hello?
2517040	2519040	What do I do?
2519040	2521040	Oh.
2529040	2531040	The game sound is louder than my voice.
2531040	2533040	I turn it down.
2533040	2535040	Don't worry, I turn it down.
2535040	2537040	I turn it down.
2539040	2541040	Is that better?
2541040	2543040	Is that better?
2549040	2551040	I can turn myself up, actually.
2551040	2553040	What am I always down there?
2553040	2555040	What the fuck?
2557040	2559040	How did that happen?
2559040	2561040	Why am I always down there?
2561040	2563040	Oh, there we go.
2563040	2565040	Is that better?
2565040	2567040	Let me know if I'm too loud, okay?
2583040	2585040	Am I just...
2587040	2589040	Am I just dumb?
2595040	2597040	Am I just dumb?
2605040	2607040	How do you use an item?
2613040	2615040	How do you use an item?
2615040	2617040	What?
2619040	2621040	What?
2625040	2627040	What?
2633040	2635040	What? I don't...
2635040	2637040	I don't understand.
2637040	2639040	I woke up here.
2651040	2653040	The door is locked.
2655040	2657040	What?
2659040	2661040	I don't remember.
2665040	2667040	What do I do?
2667040	2669040	Help me.
2675040	2677040	Maybe something has to do with this window.
2677040	2679040	Maybe I hold this in my hand.
2679040	2681040	Or something.
2681040	2683040	Ah!
2683040	2685040	In the faint light,
2685040	2687040	you can glimpse
2687040	2689040	the face of the remote.
2691040	2693040	Ah! All of our numbers accept.
2697040	2699040	Zero, six, three.
2699040	2701040	Seven are missing.
2703040	2705040	Zero, six, three.
2711040	2713040	Zero.
2723040	2725040	No.
2737040	2739040	This is six, this is three, yeah?
2741040	2743040	X is granted.
2747040	2749040	Okay. Ah, computer.
2749040	2751040	I'm in.
2751040	2753040	Let's go!
2753040	2755040	Okay.
2755040	2757040	You found me.
2757040	2759040	Why?
2761040	2763040	You're already too late.
2763040	2765040	Not much of the world remains.
2767040	2769040	This will be apparent once you go outside.
2771040	2773040	This place was never worth saving.
2775040	2777040	Do you still want to try?
2779040	2781040	I remember this.
2781040	2785040	Your actions here will affect Miko.
2785040	2787040	You talking to me?
2789040	2791040	You talking to me?
2793040	2795040	Your mission is to help Miko leave.
2797040	2799040	And most importantly,
2799040	2801040	Oh!
2807040	2809040	You only have one shot.
2811040	2813040	Azura.
2817040	2819040	This will be so fun.
2819040	2821040	If I was on like
2821040	2823040	display,
2823040	2825040	I'll show you my monitor.
2829040	2833040	And you guys can see the little things pop up too.
2847040	2849040	It makes it small windowed again.
2851040	2853040	No, I gotta make it big.
2853040	2855040	Here we go.
2859040	2861040	Miko, here's the sound of a door unlocking.
2875040	2877040	A weathered plant sits here,
2877040	2879040	stiff and dry.
2879040	2881040	A branch snaps off.
2881040	2883040	A branch.
2883040	2885040	It's me! It's me, I'm Miko.
2885040	2887040	I'm Miko.

2897040	2899040	A pair of luminous yellow eyes stare back at Miko.
2903040	2905040	There's no water in the toilet.
2905040	2907040	Are you gonna take a poop ball?

3306840	3335840	The urge to break it is real.
3335840	3349840	It's left of a computer terminal.
3349840	3358840	What in here?
3358840	3367840	I might have to dim the brightness.
3367840	3374840	You can quickly travel to the locations you have already visited by selecting the fast travel option in the menu.
3374840	3377840	You wanna know something funny?
3377840	3381840	When I played this game the first time, I didn't know there was a fast travel option.
3381840	3387840	Did you know I walked everywhere on foot?
3387840	3391840	That's the only thing I remember from this game.
3391840	3399840	I walked everywhere on foot.
3399840	3407840	The default key for opening the menu is A.
3407840	3410840	I didn't mind it.
3410840	3415840	I like the slight realism of just walking everywhere.
3415840	3422840	It was fun.
3422840	3425840	It wasn't. It wasn't added there in the start. It's new.
3425840	3428840	Well, that makes sense.
3428840	3433840	That makes sense.
3433840	3440840	I played it when there wasn't a fast travel then because I walked everywhere.
3440840	3444840	It was fun though.
3444840	3449840	I remember getting lost in this place. A robot.
3449840	3460840	And no longer has power.
3460840	3481840	There's a robot left.
3481840	3487840	There's a robot left.
3487840	3497840	I don't like long walks.
3497840	3501840	I don't know why that scared me, but it did.
3501840	3512840	There's a robot left.
3512840	3522840	I don't know why that scared me.
3522840	3532840	I don't know why that scared me.
3533840	3538840	Thanks.
3538840	3542840	Sorry. I'm a little lost.
3542840	3547840	Alright. Allow me to explain some things.
3547840	3550840	May I first ask how you arrived here?
3550840	3554840	I'm not sure.
3554840	3559840	I woke up in this weird house.
3559840	3563840	It was really dark.
3563840	3570840	So you woke up in an unfamiliar dark location?
3570840	3574840	Just as my prophecy foretold, yes.
3574840	3578840	You are the savior we have been waiting for.
3578840	3586840	You will be the one to save our world from internal darkness.
3586840	3590840	I will now provide you with vital information.
3590840	3593840	Please ask me anything.
3593840	3600840	Well, can you tell me about this world?
3600840	3603840	I'm not sure where I am exactly.
3603840	3608840	I can't see too far off everything so dark.
3608840	3615840	Our world was not always this dim.
3615840	3618840	Tomorrow was it so broken.
3618840	3624840	But time waits for nobody, not even saviors.
3624840	3627840	The world is divided into three regions.
3627840	3632840	You are on the fringe right now, the barons.
3632840	3648840	The tower you see in the distance once held our sun.
3648840	3652840	Oh, so that's what the tall thing was?
3652840	3661840	As you go further toward the center, you will cross the other regions.
3661840	3664840	There should be a map still.
3664840	3667840	And this outpost somewhere.
3667840	3674840	Oh, can you tell me about the label?
3674840	3679840	I found it in the house I woke up in.
3679840	3685840	But then your hands is our new sun.
3685840	3689840	Bro, I can't read your sun.
3689840	3695840	It's child. He's holding his child.
3695840	3701840	Yes, years ago, our previous sun set atop that tower
3701840	3704840	and spilled its life into the land.
3704840	3708840	But one day, the light went out.
3708840	3713840	Oh.
3713840	3717840	The world is still hanging on by a thread.
3717840	3725840	The surface of this world is abundant with an element called phosphor.
3725840	3734840	Fortunately for us, this element stored light, energy from our previous sun.
3734840	3738840	It's now our only source of illumination.
3738840	3748840	But its energy is...
3748840	3752840	Vinnit! Vinnit! Find it!
3752840	3761840	Find it! Find it! Find it! Find it! Find it! Find it!
3761840	3791840	ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ�
3791840	3793840	Good night.
3793840	3795840	Sleep well.
3795840	3800840	When the last of the light dies, our world will too.
3800840	3803840	Ah.
3803840	3810840	But now that you are here, with the new sun, all is well.
3810840	3814840	You will need to restore it to the power.
3814840	3819840	That looks pretty far off.
3819840	3821840	Yes.
3821840	3827840	So begins your pilgrimage.
3827840	3831840	Also, the sun is fragile.
3831840	3833840	So be careful.
3833840	3840840	If the sun shatters, the world will end in an instant.
3840840	3842840	Oh.
3842840	3846840	Can you tell me about a computer?
3846840	3853840	In the house, I found this computer.
3853840	3859840	It kept saying stuff like, your actions here will affect Niko.
3859840	3863840	But I'm Niko.
3863840	3866840	I'm Niko. I'm Niko.
3866840	3869840	Yes, you are Niko.
3869840	3873840	Are those messages meant for someone else?
3873840	3875840	Hmm.
3875840	3882840	If I had to guess, they might be trying to pass the message to Azura.
3882840	3886840	It's me!
3886840	3888840	It's me!
3888840	3892840	Azura!
3892840	3897840	It's me!
3897840	3900840	Azura?
3901840	3905840	That would be our god.
3905840	3907840	I'm your god.
3907840	3909840	Your goddess.
3909840	3911840	Azura.
3911840	3913840	Dule.
3918840	3926840	If you are here, that means Azura is here also.
3926840	3930840	Azura will provide guidance for your journey.
3930840	3935840	In fact, they already have.
3935840	3937840	Really?
3937840	3941840	I haven't seen anyone else, anyone though.
3941840	3947840	Have you not contacted Azura yet?
3947840	3950840	I don't think so.
3950840	3955840	Being the bringer of our sun, you have the sacred ability to communicate directly with Azura.
3956840	3961840	Ah, an ability that no one else possesses.
3961840	3964840	Certainly not I.
3964840	3967840	Hmm? Hmm?
3967840	3972840	Please close your eyes and focus.
3972840	3975840	Alright.
3977840	3984840	Hello? Azura? Are you there?
3985840	3990840	Yes, I am.
3990840	3996840	Oh, nice to meet you, Azura.
3996840	3998840	My name is Niko.
3998840	4002840	I see you too, Niko. You are so cute.
4002840	4007840	That's horrible.
4010840	4013840	I actually heard someone.
4014840	4018840	They said their name is Azura.
4018840	4021840	This is incredible.
4021840	4025840	Do not be afraid to ask Azura for assistance.
4025840	4030840	You are a messiah after all.
4030840	4035840	Can you tell me about going home?
4035840	4041840	Home. I don't mean to be rude, but I'm not sure about this.
4041840	4044840	I still don't know how I got here.
4044840	4047840	I was just with my mama a few hours ago.
4052840	4058840	And now it feels like I'm in a bad dream.
4058840	4062840	I just want to go home.
4062840	4065840	Your mission is to save our world.
4065840	4070840	Just as my mission is to tell you about our world,
4070840	4073840	I'm unable to help you beyond my programming.
4073840	4076840	I'm sorry.
4076840	4081840	Oh.
4081840	4084840	I think that's all I have to ask for now.
4084840	4086840	Excellent.
4086840	4088840	I wish you luck.
4088840	4090840	Going on here?
4090840	4092840	It's in there.
4092840	4097840	A robot without power.
4097840	4099840	Dusty shells.
4100840	4103840	Where does the shell splutter?
4103840	4109840	The use of a robot as our placement had engineer seems unorthodox.
4109840	4114840	Especially the one responsible for the last year's incident.
4114840	4119840	I suppose they had to get her away from the city.
4119840	4124840	But that doesn't make it easier to swallow for those of us who worked here.
4124840	4126840	I hope that man knows what he's doing.
4126840	4129840	Management.
4131840	4134840	Dusty shells.
4134840	4136840	Where does the shell?
4138840	4140840	Where does the shell?
4144840	4146840	The faded poster.
4146840	4148840	Reminder to all workers,
4148840	4152840	the rarest form of blue phosphor is found during the fall.
4152840	4155840	The rarest form of blue phosphor is found during the fall.
4156840	4161840	The rarest form of blue phosphor is found during the phosphor shrimp spawn.
4161840	4164840	Period.
4164840	4171840	If you observe a pond with a bubbled over surface, please contact management immediately.
4171840	4174840	We will dispatch to harvest team ASAP.
4174840	4180840	ASAP. ASAP. ASAP. ASAP.
4180840	4183840	It's a faded poster.
4183840	4187840	Five new positions available at the mine.
4187840	4192840	Housing, other provisions are included upon hiring.
4192840	4195840	First come, first serve.
4195840	4199840	I keep freaking out at run.
4199840	4202840	Run.
4202840	4207840	Robot. It seems to be okay. Just doesn't have power.
4207840	4211840	Dusty shells. Dusty shells.
4212840	4214840	It won't turn on.
4229840	4233840	Mama Zura is doing well. Don't worry about me.
4233840	4237840	Hope you're all doing well and welcoming those who just came in.
4237840	4239840	Welcome, welcome.
4239840	4243840	Self-charging solar battery model.
4243840	4248840	N87. One year warranty included.
4253840	4259840	Simply place your self-charging battery in full daylight with the lens facing up.
4259840	4262840	Charges in seconds. No external powers needed.
4262840	4265840	Troubleshooting manual.
4266840	4275840	If the battery fails to charge, check to see if the lens on the front side has been dislodged during transport.
4275840	4279840	One charge cycle will last about 10 days.
4279840	4287840	If you notice a decline in the charge cycle within the warranty period, please contact the manufacturer.
4287840	4290840	This box looks interesting.
4290840	4293840	I wish I had something to pry it open with.
4298840	4308840	A robot may not injure a living person, or through an action, allow a person to come to harm.
4308840	4319840	A robot must obey the orders given to it by people, except where such orders would conflict with the first law.
4319840	4330840	A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.
4331840	4334840	The world.
4334840	4336840	We're in the bare hands.
4336840	4339840	Then inside is the glen.
4339840	4342840	And then the refuge.
4342840	4345840	And then the tower in the center.
4349840	4352840	How open? Do I have anything?
4353840	4359840	Oh, a bottle can open it.
4365840	4368840	Robot without power.
4378840	4381840	Paper with faded ink.
4381840	4390840	Able to provide power to all robots and machinery in an area via a large electromagnetic field.
4390840	4395840	Maintenance efforts are quite high as expected.
4395840	4404840	We have provided customized backup cells for the few most important robots.
4404840	4411840	Their electromagnetic fields are much weaker, and the signals are high specific.
4411840	4414840	Highly supposed to be a good amount.
4419840	4425840	In other words, these small cells can only charge one single.
4425840	4427840	Ah.
4430840	4433840	It's a sort of small machine. I wonder what it does.
4433840	4436840	I can feel my hair standing up a little.
4438840	4444840	There's a lot of small goings from swimming in the bottle.
4444840	4446840	Can I use it?
4456840	4458840	That's a big machine.
4458840	4461840	Those seem to be doing anything though.
4461840	4464840	It's a rectangular shape hole in the middle.
4464840	4467840	Like something you use to fit in here.
4471840	4473840	How do you use items?
4479840	4481840	Hmm.
4482840	4489840	Don't walk me walk.
4493840	4495840	Do I have to look for something?
4496840	4498840	Am I missing something?
4511840	4513840	I don't know.
4542840	4545840	It's over here.
4553840	4556840	I was going to leave it on spooky in here.
4556840	4560840	A robot sitting on a conveyor belt doesn't seem enough power.
4562840	4566840	Robot? It seems to be okay. Just enough power.
4572840	4577840	You imagine equal trips on a pebble,
4577840	4580840	and the orb shotters would be catastrophic.
4580840	4582840	Did she get it?
4582840	4584840	Catastrophic.
4589840	4591840	Catastrophic.
4591840	4593840	Catastrophic.
4593840	4595840	Catastrophic.
4600840	4602840	A big machine.
4602840	4604840	Looks to be used to crush metal.
4615840	4617840	It's barely damaged.
4619840	4621840	A robot's arm.
4623840	4625840	A robot's arm.
4625840	4627840	A robot's arm.
4627840	4629840	A robot's arm.
4629840	4631840	A robot's arm.
4631840	4633840	A robot's arm.
4637840	4639840	Why would you want to smash a bottle here, Ezra?
4639840	4642840	The shots could get anywhere.

4781980	4788380	... so the vent zone, barren workers was still recommended to wear gas masks.
4788380	4795820	This mask would mandatory around active vent sites of course. As more and more of the workforce got
4795820	4803500	replaced by robots, we found ourselves with the surplus of abandoned gas masks. It seemed like
4803500	4809500	like a waste to get rid of them all, so we kept a few for our emergencies.
4810500	4814500	I don't know where I got our, my brain just inserted the word.
4834500	4837500	Wait, there's a note over there.
4841500	4844500	I don't see the note. How do I get that note?
4844500	4860500	Oh, a middle safe. It seems like it's locked with a six digit code.
4860500	4865500	I don't remember seeing any six digit codes to use or up.
4868500	4872500	No, that wasn't it.
4875500	4877500	This way.
4886500	4892500	Let me have a six line, six line, six line.
4893500	4897500	I'm not evil. I'm innocent.
4898500	4904500	The sun will not return and the abyss is calling my name.
4904500	4910500	I'm sorry everyone for choosing to leave before the darkness of the case is all.
4915500	4917500	Yikes.
4928500	4932500	Oh, this is where I was going to go anyway.
4933500	4935500	What's up there?
4943500	4946500	I don't think I should be here.
4948500	4951500	So we will not go there.
4958500	4961500	Wait, what's that? Was I there?
4962500	4964500	Did I go this way?
4965500	4967500	What's another note?
4972500	4975500	I turn page with faded inks.
4976500	4978500	X, X, X, X.
4979500	4983500	With the mining operation going smoothly,
4983500	4987500	materials are no longer a limiting factor.
4988500	4995500	We will be able to build more resilient robots, both in body and mind.
4995500	5008500	Specifically, the discovery of metal alloy 291 will likely allow the development of highly efficient circuitry.
5008500	5010500	Cool.
5010500	5012500	Are these just rocks?
5014500	5017500	Can I like jump?
5025500	5029500	It's okay to be scared of the dark. Don't worry.
5029500	5031500	It's a robot.
5031500	5034500	A robot with no power, just like the rest.
5056500	5058500	It's a house.
5060500	5063500	Oh, the light bulb.
5064500	5067500	So are you the Messiah?
5067500	5069500	That's what I've been told.
5069500	5073500	I expected someone taller.
5073500	5075500	Vrulda? Vrulda?
5075500	5077500	I can get big for you, alright?
5077500	5079500	I'll get nice and big.
5081500	5085500	Or at least someone that doesn't look like a kitten.
5085500	5088500	Leave me alone, you bully.
5088500	5090500	Leave me alone.
5091500	5094500	He's still growing.
5094500	5097500	Love you guys on mine, I'm gonna eat a snack.
5106500	5109500	And that's what you are, right?
5109500	5112500	Some sort of cat.
5112500	5114500	Vrulda?
5114500	5116500	No.
5116500	5118500	I'm a person.
5121500	5123500	That's right, you tell him, Niko.
5123500	5125500	You're a person.
5125500	5129500	You got the eyes of a cat.
5129500	5133500	But cats walk on four legs.
5133500	5135500	Well, either way.
5156500	5161500	A child like you being the Messiah just doesn't feel right.
5161500	5166500	But that robot back there said there's no mistake.
5166500	5168500	I know.
5173500	5178500	This is going to be, this is going to sound cold, but
5178500	5183500	I honestly think you're better off just leaving
5183500	5186500	and letting the world die naturally.
5186500	5189500	Wow, no.
5192500	5195500	What a downer, man, mama.
5199500	5202500	You go party, Popar.
5204500	5206500	The world has its bones.
5206500	5208500	Wow, I don't know what happened.
5208500	5211500	But English just decided not to work with me.
5213500	5217500	The world has been falling apart for a long time.
5217500	5223500	This manner of decay is highly unprobable.
5223500	5227500	Probable that the sun can fix it.
5227500	5230500	It doesn't hurt to try.
5230500	5232500	Jesus.
5232500	5236500	You've already seen how bad it can get, right?
5236500	5239500	They haven't seen much of anything, actually.
5239500	5242500	And you can't really just leave.
5242500	5245500	Oh, so you just got here.
5245500	5248500	Then you must be headed towards the tower.
5248500	5250500	Mm-hmm.
5250500	5252500	It's where I'm supposed to put the light bulb.
5252500	5256500	Or sun, isn't it?
5256500	5258500	Yeah, at the very top.
5258500	5261500	We know that the tower contains a force
5261500	5264500	that nobody could comprehend.
5264500	5267500	And the power is strongest at the summit.
5267500	5271500	Maybe it will send you back home after you complete your mission.
5271500	5273500	Oh?
5273500	5275500	Don't take my word for it, though.
5295500	5298500	This is definitely not Dark Souls.
5302500	5304500	Mm-hmm.
5304500	5306500	It went up.
5306500	5308500	Mm-hmm.
5308500	5310500	Mm-hmm.
5330500	5333500	Just leave the world before it's in our time.
5338500	5340500	Ah, wrong button.
5368500	5371500	A glass is a bit too foggy to see details, though.
5376500	5380500	A shelf of weird tools and a piece of metal.
5380500	5382500	Still silver.
5382500	5384500	I heard the news about the mines.
5384500	5387500	I'm sorry, I can't imagine what you're feeling.
5387500	5389500	It's been two weeks.
5389500	5391500	I know it must be hard.
5391500	5394500	But maybe it's better that you come back.
5394500	5397500	It's only a matter of time before the roll.
5397500	5399500	Robots.
5399500	5402500	That's right. Robots.
5402500	5405500	What a cute misspell.
5405500	5407500	Are we called?
5407500	5411500	At least let me know you got my message, okay?
5411500	5413500	Kip.
5413500	5416500	Something is poking out of the shelf.
5416500	5418500	Ah, the screwdriver.
5418500	5420500	You can take it if you want.
5420500	5421500	It may help you.
5421500	5423500	Oh, are you sure?
5423500	5425500	Yes, I have many.
5425500	5427500	Thank you.
5429500	5433500	A shelf of weird tools and a piece of metal.
5433500	5435500	Please don't touch that.
5435500	5437500	Oh, sorry, I got curious.
5437500	5439500	What is this thing?
5439500	5441500	Back-up power cell.
5441500	5443500	It keeps me functional.
5443500	5450500	The main generator for the barons ran out of power some time ago.
5450500	5453500	It could not even last a week without the sun.
5453500	5455500	Sorry to hear that.
5457500	5461500	All we can do is make use of the light we have.
5468500	5471500	It's a metal chess table covered in dust.
5473500	5475500	I have, oh my god.
5479500	5482500	Water time. Water break.
5484500	5486500	Oh.
5490500	5493500	Having a swollen esophagus really sucks.
5500500	5504500	I haven't played chess with anyone else for a very long time.
5505500	5507500	Ahem.
5510500	5512500	Oh?
5512500	5516500	Not even with the other robots?
5516500	5518500	No.
5518500	5523500	Nobody in the barons have that capacity in their programming.
5523500	5527500	Nobody here is tamed for that matter.
5527500	5530500	What is tamed? I remember.
5534500	5536500	Talk to me.
5536500	5538500	What's inside the tower?
5538500	5542500	I don't know. Nobody's ever entered it before.
5542500	5546500	At least nobody.
5546500	5549500	Nobody history knows.
5549500	5552500	Nobody history knows.
5552500	5556500	Nobody history knows.
5556500	5559500	Nobody history knows.
5564500	5567500	Nobody history knows.
5569500	5571500	Moving on.
5571500	5573500	Then who built it?
5577500	5579500	Built?
5579500	5583500	As far as anyone can tell, it's been there since the beginning of time.
5587500	5590500	I know someone who wanted to study it before, but...
5591500	5593500	Oh?
5593500	5596500	He never told me if it went anywhere.
5604500	5606500	Do you need further assistance?
5606500	5608500	We're good, thanks.
5608500	5610500	Huh?
5613500	5615500	Hmm.
5621500	5623500	I don't know.
5628500	5630500	Am I supposed to be this way?
5634500	5636500	Wait.
5639500	5642500	I saw you heading towards this direction.
5642500	5645500	The Mayans have been abandoned for a long time.
5645500	5648500	I can't not guarantee that it's safe.
5648500	5653500	If you must enter it, it's my duty to accompany you at least.
5653500	5655500	Oh, thanks.
5659500	5661500	They're so fast.
5661500	5663500	It's cool.
5663500	5665500	Do be careful in here.
5667500	5669500	There's a little gadget on the ground.
5669500	5671500	Looks kinda like a camera.
5671500	5673500	But it's left of a camera anyway.
5673500	5676500	Probably even part of a robot at one point.
5676500	5679500	Oh? Or not? I don't know.
5683500	5685500	Can I go this way?
5687500	5689500	I see a faint yellow glow in the distance.
5689500	5692500	I'll stand so close to the edge.
5692500	5694500	Sorry.
5694500	5698500	Looks like even the entrance tunnel collapsed.
5699500	5702500	Without a vehicle, we can't foresee it.
5702500	5704500	Can we walk? I can.
5704500	5707500	But for you, it's a safety violation.
5707500	5709500	I won't allow it.
5709500	5711500	What's ahead anyway?
5711500	5715500	It's a huge network of underground lines that source
5715500	5720500	a source of this world's metal and non-phosphor fuel.
5720500	5725500	This is what propelled the world into industrial age.
5725500	5729500	So now it's lost forever.
5729500	5731500	It's been for a while now.
5731500	5734500	When the sun went out, the mines were the first to be abandoned
5734500	5737500	and missed initial panic.
5737500	5741500	Even the robots have been all cleared out and repurposed.
5741500	5743500	That makes sense.
5745500	5749500	It's like how you can say history, forgot someone,
5749500	5752500	an event if the records of it are lost.
5752500	5754500	Oh!
5754500	5757500	I've never heard anyone say it like that before,
5757500	5760500	so it's good to know now.
5761500	5764500	Those are definitely words.
5764500	5766500	Yeah.
5768500	5772500	No, there was one that always insist on going back.
5772500	5774500	No?
5774500	5776500	I'll be okay.
5776500	5780500	You know, when you read a word or a sentence or something
5780500	5783500	and it just doesn't sound right, no matter how you say it,
5783500	5788500	or like when you spell out a word and you're spelling it correctly,
5788500	5791500	but it just doesn't look right.
5791500	5795500	It's like you finally looked at the word and actually looked at it
5795500	5798500	and it still doesn't look right.
5798500	5802500	That's what that felt like right then and there.
5819500	5824500	They have kind of uncanny valley of grammar.
5824500	5826500	I think that's it.
5826500	5828500	Oh, there's anything else in here.
5828500	5830500	We'll leave.
5830500	5832500	Ready to leave?
5832500	5834500	Mm-hmm.
5834500	5836500	Mm.
5842500	5844500	All right.
5849500	5851500	Mm-hmm.
5869500	5871500	Mm-hmm.
5871500	5874500	Oh yeah, I forgot I got fast travel.
5875500	5878500	I was going to walk all the way back.
5878500	5881500	How do you fast travel again?
5896500	5898500	Which one is it?
5900500	5902500	I don't remember.
5904500	5906500	Aha!
5906500	5908500	It was good.
5908500	5910500	Are you the one?
5918500	5920500	Wait.
5920500	5922500	You have this screwdriver.
5922500	5924500	I can open up the box.
5928500	5930500	Hello again.
5930500	5932500	Are there more questions you wish to ask?
5932500	5934500	No.
5934500	5936500	It's all right. Thank you.
5936500	5938500	I'm not kidding. I wish you safe travels.
5958500	5961500	The screwdriver is not nearly big enough to pry it open.
5961500	5963500	Come on.
5963500	5965500	Come on. It's open.
5985500	5987500	I'm feeling I'm missing something.
5991500	5993500	What would you need the screwdriver for?
6017500	6019500	I forgot I can run as well.
6019500	6021500	I'm slow walking.
6045500	6047500	What if my scarf got caught in there
6047500	6049500	and then it'll pull me in
6049500	6051500	and not going to finish that sentence?
6051500	6053500	That's the...
6057500	6059500	That's a horrible thought.
6061500	6063500	A big machine.
6065500	6067500	What do you use the machine for?
6071500	6073500	What can I use the screwdriver for?
6077500	6079500	I'm not forgetting something.
6081500	6083500	Am I forgetting something?
6085500	6087500	I feel I am forgetting something.
6107500	6109500	Is there anything in here?
6129500	6131500	Anything up here?
6137500	6139500	I don't know.
6167500	6169500	What is this?
6169500	6171500	A metal pipe.
6171500	6173500	It must have broken out from one of these terminals.
6175500	6177500	It's not bad.
6179500	6181500	I'm a little tired from walking.
6181500	6183500	It's all right if I take a nap.
6183500	6185500	It's all right if I take a nap.
6185500	6187500	It's all right if I take a nap.
6187500	6189500	It's all right if I take a nap.
6189500	6191500	It's all right if I take a nap.
6191500	6193500	It's all right if I take a nap.
6193500	6195500	It's all right if I take a nap.
6195500	6197500	It's all right if I take a nap.
6197500	6199500	Sure.
6199500	6201500	A little nappy.
6201500	6203500	Nappy for Nico.
6222500	6223500	Hello?
6224500	6225500	L goodbye?
6227500	6228500	Hello?
6231500	6232500	Hello?
6234500	6236500	Did I break the game?
6237500	6238500	Did I break the game?

6304280	6306280	You're so cute!
6313280	6315280	You're so cute!
6323280	6325280	Azura, are you still there?
6328280	6329280	Yes.
6331280	6332280	I'm awake.
6333280	6334280	I had a dream just now.
6335280	6336280	I saw it.
6336280	6337280	You did?
6338280	6339280	Wow.
6340280	6341280	I...
6341280	6343280	I really thought I was back home.
6347280	6350280	Oh, the sun back in my home world is in a light bulb.
6351280	6353280	There's a big ball of fire in the sky.
6355280	6356280	I don't...
6356280	6359280	I don't think I would be able to hold it
6359280	6363280	like I do with the sun for your world.
6364280	6365280	This isn't my world.
6366280	6367280	Huh?
6368280	6370280	This isn't the world I live in.
6371280	6372280	Really?
6373280	6374280	I guess not.
6378280	6381280	If you're the god of this world,
6382280	6384280	you wouldn't necessarily be in it.
6385280	6387280	What's your home world called?
6390280	6391280	Earth.
6395280	6396280	Earth.
6398280	6399280	Earth.
6401280	6404280	Like, the stuff on the ground.
6406280	6408280	Why is he so cute?
6412280	6414280	I want to squish him.
6414280	6416280	I want to squish him.
6419280	6420280	Squish.
6425280	6426280	Wait.
6426280	6428280	Do you live on the ground?
6428280	6430280	No, silly.
6432280	6433280	No.
6435280	6436280	Ah,
6437280	6438280	neither do we.
6440280	6443280	Bustros and field mice and stuff too.
6444280	6446280	Does your world have a sun?
6450280	6451280	Yes.
6451280	6453280	It's also a ball of fire.
6454280	6455280	Really?
6455280	6456280	Wow.
6457280	6459280	Can you hold it?
6462280	6464280	That was a silly question, wasn't it?
6465280	6467280	It's okay, baby.
6467280	6468280	It's okay.
6469280	6471280	No silly question.
6472280	6475280	Actually, little nickel.
6480280	6485280	The sun in my home world is very bright.
6486280	6487280	Warm too.
6488280	6489280	You saw, right?
6490280	6492280	But it goes away sometimes at night.
6493280	6494280	Everything gets dark.
6495280	6497280	Kind of like how this world is now.
6498280	6501280	But it's okay because sun always comes back the next day.
6502280	6504280	That's good, won't you think?
6505280	6507280	My world is like that too.
6508280	6509280	Ah.
6510280	6512280	Do you sleep during the night?
6512280	6514280	We go to sleep usually.
6515280	6518280	I sometimes sleep.
6519280	6523280	I have a hard time sleeping a little bit of insomnia.
6524280	6530280	So I have to take my medication that usually puts me to sleep.
6530280	6532280	But sometimes it doesn't work.
6532280	6536280	And I'll be up for hours before falling asleep around like 6 in the morning.
6538280	6540280	Sleep is very hard.
6543280	6546280	That's why I was surprised to have extremely good sleep last night.
6546280	6548280	I went to sleep pretty early.
6548280	6550280	It was really good.
6550280	6552280	I think I was snoring.
6553280	6556280	I usually do not snore, but I feel like I did.
6556280	6558280	I woke up drooling.
6558280	6560280	It was like all over my arm.
6568280	6571280	I don't have to explain what they are.
6571280	6572280	Do I?
6573280	6575280	Did I miss something?
6576280	6578280	There's a bunch of them in this world.
6578280	6579280	A bunch of what?
6579280	6580280	Did I miss something?
6587280	6590280	Anyway, you should probably get going.
6595280	6597280	Do you have some shams?
6597280	6599280	I think I'll sit here.
6602280	6605280	Oh, computers? You're talking about computers?
6607280	6608280	Let's see.
6617280	6620280	There's something in the air here.
6620280	6622280	It hurts to breathe.
6647280	6649280	I have a lot.
6672280	6675280	The pipe won't fit under the cracks.
6675280	6677280	We need to flatten it.
6678280	6681280	I know. I know how.
6681280	6684280	We can flatten it. Let's go flatten it.
6685280	6687280	Big scary machine.
6694280	6697280	Do you want me to crush the pipe in here, Azora?
6698280	6700280	I don't want to get too close.
6701280	6703280	That was scary.
6704280	6706280	I was scared for you. Don't worry.
6707280	6709280	I wouldn't be near this at all.
6712280	6713280	Good night.
6714280	6715280	Good night.
6715280	6716280	Good girl.
6716280	6717280	We're being here.
6717280	6718280	Stopping by.
6719280	6720280	Hello.
6721280	6722280	9-9.
6724280	6726280	We're in the way.
6726280	6727280	Hello.
6728280	6730280	It's turning my way.
6732280	6734280	This bus looks interesting.
6734280	6736280	Wait, I wasn't holding it.
6737280	6739280	I have a crowbar now.
6741280	6743280	Wait, did I not click on it?
6745280	6747280	This bar should open it.
6748280	6751280	This little mill cube and some broken glass in here
6751280	6753280	looks like what I used
6754280	6755280	to be
6756280	6757280	what used to be a machine bar.
6757280	6760280	Wow, my English is just so horrendous.
6761280	6765280	It says solar battery on the side.
6771280	6773280	You screwed right up the lens out?
6773280	6774280	Okay.
6778280	6779280	The lens pops right in.
6780280	6781280	Broken battery.
6782280	6784280	Boom, boom, boom.
6784280	6785280	Let's go.
6793280	6794280	It's like my hand.
6798280	6799280	Empty.
6800280	6802280	We're using the sun directly on the battery?
6802280	6803280	Yes.
6804280	6806280	I would have never thought of that.
6807280	6808280	Good thinking, Azura.
6808280	6809280	I'm smart.
6811280	6814280	It looks like it's already fully charged.
6814280	6815280	That was fast.
6821280	6824280	Let's hope the charge battery does something.
6830280	6831280	Oh, my eyes.
6831280	6832280	It was.
6839280	6841280	It wasn't even that bright.
6852280	6853280	Oh, I wasn't sneezing.
6853280	6854280	Sorry.
6854280	6855280	I wasn't sneezing.
6855280	6856280	I didn't sneeze.
6858280	6859280	I wasn't sneezing.
6861280	6862280	Oh, thank you.
6862280	6863280	Thank you.
6875280	6876280	Ow.
6876280	6877280	I just got shot.
6878280	6880280	Oh, you're not getting out of the tube, man.
6884280	6885280	Shot, not fun.
6885280	6887280	Robots are right.
6887280	6888280	I am functional.
6888280	6890280	Did you power the generator?
6890280	6892280	I, I guess we did.
6892280	6893280	Right, Azura?
6897280	6898280	I am functional.
6898280	6899280	I can walk.
6901280	6902280	Congratulations.
6915280	6916280	I see you.
6919280	6921280	I see you've made progress in the world, Azura.
6921280	6923280	Oh, I didn't mean click, click, click.
6923280	6925280	Oh, no, I don't know what it said.
6926280	6929280	I believe you need a code to unlock certain bots.
6930280	6933280	Well, the code no longer exists in this world.
6936280	6938280	Do you understand what that means, Azura?
6940280	6941280	Yes.
6941280	6942280	Good.
6942280	6943280	Start looking.
6943280	6944280	All right.
6959280	6960280	I think
6963280	6965280	if I remember correctly,
6967280	6970280	I go here, then here,
6971280	6973280	browse local files.
6976280	6977280	Ah,
6978280	6979280	read me.
6983280	6984280	No, not here.
6988280	6989280	Uh,
6994280	6995280	but,
6995280	6996280	but,
6999280	7000280	I don't,
7010280	7011280	I don't remember.
7019280	7022280	Oh, no, that's, that's the game, right?
7026280	7027280	Oh.
7031280	7032280	What do I do?
7033280	7034280	I'm scared.
7041280	7042280	I'm actually frightened.
7042280	7043280	Oh.
7044280	7045280	Oh.
7055280	7056280	Oh.
7077280	7079280	What the heck is this?
7081280	7082280	I,
7085280	7086280	I don't know.
7102280	7103280	Oh, I found it.
7106280	7107280	Oh, no, I exited.
7110280	7111280	I found it.
7111280	7112280	I'm smart.
7112280	7113280	I'm intelligent.
7115280	7116280	I'm smart.
7130280	7132280	Where was the box this way, right?
7137280	7140280	A computer asked me to find some files
7140280	7143280	to find the password for the box.
7143280	7145280	It wasn't to me.
7145280	7147280	Directly to me.
7149280	7152280	And I think it's for this box right here.
7153280	7154280	A metal safe.
7154280	7157280	Seems like it's locked with a 66 code.
7157280	7159280	I don't remember the code.
7159280	7161280	Ah, it's an 86 code.
7161280	7163280	I do, I have it.
7166280	7167280	Five,
7167280	7168280	two,
7169280	7170280	five,
7171280	7172280	three, zero.
7173280	7174280	Oh.
7186280	7189280	Okay, if that wasn't it, then what is it?
7197280	7199280	Or is it a code for something else?
7203280	7204280	No.
7213280	7214280	What?
7214280	7216280	I'm so confused.
7222280	7223280	Yeah, this is,
7224280	7226280	this is what they sent me.
7227280	7228280	What now?
7229280	7231280	A code for a box?
7232280	7234280	A code for a box?
7243280	7245280	Is one of the zeros an eight?
7245280	7246280	No.
7247280	7249280	That's a, it's definitely a zero.
7252280	7254280	It's definitely, definitely a zero.
7255280	7256280	Um.
7259280	7260280	Yes?
7262280	7263280	Oh, no.
7267280	7269280	Wait, wait.
7270280	7272280	I wasn't paying attention.
7277280	7279280	Can I ask him that again?
7280280	7285280	Is it the same?
7285280	7287280	So empty here is why it's called a baron.
7287280	7291280	Are there any people living in this area besides robots?
7291280	7293280	I mean, I don't know.
7293280	7295280	I was not built to wander,
7295280	7297280	not built to,
7297280	7300280	so you just stand here and speak boring.
7300280	7302280	Do you at least have friends,
7302280	7305280	robot friends?
7305280	7308280	I cannot desire companionship.
7308280	7310280	I have not been tamed.
7310280	7311280	Not tamed?
7311280	7313280	There was no time.
7313280	7314280	I see.
7317280	7319280	Close the other questions.
7319280	7320280	Prophecy?
7320280	7323280	What is this prophecy exactly?
7325280	7328280	The prophet predicted that a savior
7328280	7331280	will arrive from another land.
7331280	7333280	The savior will wake up in a strange house,
7333280	7336280	find the sun, and illuminate the world.
7336280	7339280	So, what else did you foresee?
7339280	7340280	What do you mean?
7340280	7343280	What else did you see in the prophecy?
7343280	7344280	Wait.
7344280	7347280	You are a prophet, right?
7347280	7349280	Good heavens, no.
7349280	7353280	We called it my prophecy earlier.
7353280	7356280	That just means it is built into my programming.
7356280	7357280	You are what?
7357280	7360280	Ah, my programming is what guides me.
7360280	7362280	I am a robot after all.
7362280	7363280	I see.
7364280	7366280	Another question.
7370280	7371280	Tower?
7371280	7373280	How tall is the tower?
7373280	7376280	I can't seem to even see the top.
7376280	7378280	I'm not allowed to answer.
7378280	7380280	But how do I get up there?
7380280	7383280	In time, as we all know what to do,
7383280	7384280	I see.
7386280	7387280	Is that it?
7387280	7389280	Yeah, what do I do?
7394280	7395280	Zora?
7397280	7400280	I am not going to smash this book.
7407280	7409280	Just let me smash it.
7409280	7410280	Let me smash.
7411280	7413280	Let me smash, please.
7414280	7415280	Let me smash.
7421280	7422280	What do I do?
7424280	7425280	What am I...
7427280	7429280	I'm functional.
7429280	7432280	I have fast travel, I forgot again.
7432280	7433280	How do I...
7451280	7454280	I have fast travel, I forgot again.
7454280	7455280	How do I...
7459280	7460280	Is this it?
7468280	7470280	Hello, small person.
7470280	7473280	You are not much better than me.
7473280	7476280	Welcome to the lookout point.
7476280	7479280	Below us is the old quarry.
7480280	7484280	The head engineer lives a little more to the east.
7485280	7487280	Never eat soggy waffles.
7487280	7492280	The entrance to the old mine is further to the east.
7492280	7493280	I see.
7495280	7497280	They take me there.
7497280	7500280	I can't open that box for some reason.
7502280	7505280	You need further suits for a good thing.
7517280	7519280	What do I do?

8193820	8195820	I should be fine with this mask on.
8212460	8214460	Is that I want to do it like me?
8215260	8217260	Can't help but look at everything.
8219500	8223500	Hello person, welcome to the old chemical processing plant.
8223500	8225500	Most of the equipments have already been relocated.
8230220	8232940	The door is ported out. The door seems loose though.
8233580	8235580	I would be able to pull it off with the right tool.
8236460	8241980	I, I have a tool. I can do that
8243100	8246940	with my trusty screwdriver to think of this
8248860	8250860	Screwdriver? I mean crowbar.
8251660	8253660	Hello workout.
8254700	8256700	This is a pair of rubber gloves.
8256700	8258700	I'll be heavy.
8260300	8262300	Is that a robot?
8262300	8269500	Hello person, the robot assembly and repair services have been discontinued at the parent.
8269500	8274460	If you have further inquiry, please contact the head of engineer.
8281020	8283020	It seems to be a page or set of a book.
8284060	8286060	Cannot overstate
8286940	8290780	the importance of cleaning solvents in the environment.
8291500	8297980	Here is a simple recipe using the alternative method discussed in the last chapter.
8298540	8301900	Utilizing the natural properties of blue phosphor.
8304940	8308140	Re, reagent? reagents?
8309100	8311100	Oh no, go back.
8311100	8313100	Instructions. I didn't see it. Dang.
8313100	8315100	I know well, ventilated.
8315100	8317100	Oops, cut.
8317100	8319100	Come on, let me read it.
8321100	8325100	I set a gas blue phosphor, rare form.
8327100	8329100	Instructions.
8329100	8332140	It's like my brain automatically presses the space bar.
8332140	8335100	I don't want to press the space bar.
8336060	8342060	I want in a well-ventilated area, directed the gas into your container of choice.
8342060	8344060	See you immediately.
8349100	8351100	Why is there bread?
8351100	8353100	My chest?
8353100	8355100	It comes from abroad.
8355100	8357100	That's why.
8357100	8359100	It comes from abroad.
8359100	8361100	I really like bread.
8361100	8363100	That's why.
8363100	8365100	And I think YouTube likes it too.
8365100	8367100	YouTube is in love with bread.
8367100	8369100	So I gave YouTube bread.
8387100	8389100	Want to robot without power?
8389100	8391100	I guess the generator can only do so much.
8393100	8399100	It's a big metal box, complicated machinery inside.
8401100	8403100	Kind of looks rusty.
8405100	8409100	It seems to be a payer tripped out of a box.
8409100	8413100	Without breaking the seal, inject the liquid phosphor into the container.
8413100	8419100	Shake vigorously to initiate the reaction.
8419100	8421100	Use as soon as possible.
8421100	8425100	If elements begin to separate, further shaking is required.
8429100	8433100	Also note, hand protection is critical after this step.
8433100	8439100	The resulting acid is moderately stronger than common household cleaners.
8439100	8445100	I don't know what the half of these words mean.
8445100	8447100	It's a good thing you're here, Azura.
8447100	8449100	Oh yeah, I'm smart.
8449100	8451100	Mm-hmm.
8451100	8453100	I know everything.
8459100	8461100	I got you, I got you, Miko.
8465100	8469100	A cleaning sponge with a rough surface.
8479100	8485100	Anything further up here?
8491100	8493100	It's a gas vent.
8497100	8503100	There's something weird about the robots who get sent to work near the gas field.
8503100	8509100	They appear to accumulate rust at a much slower rate than the others.
8509100	8515100	The few who work directly with gas harvesting looks practically new.
8517100	8523100	Is that a result of the atmosphere, fear, or am I just seeing things?
8527100	8529100	I just came from there.
8533100	8535100	Anything else?
8545100	8551100	I'm just like exploring everything, making sure I've seen it all, you know?
8551100	8555100	It's a giant robot. I'm scared.
8563100	8567100	Oh, hello. What are you doing here?
8567100	8573100	A living person such as yourself should have evacuated this place long ago.
8573100	8579100	But I just got here to this world of you. See? I have a son.
8579100	8583100	Oh, the Messiah. I do not know what to say.
8583100	8589100	Greetings. You were not part of my programming. Have you spoken to the Prophet Bot?
8589100	8595100	I think so, yeah. Prophet Bot was built with the sole purpose of greeting you.
8595100	8599100	Really? Yes, you cannot speak with anyone else.
8599100	8609100	At least not with ease. Oh, that's kind of sad. Indeed it is.
8609100	8613100	What are you built for then? My purpose is to guard this settlement.
8613100	8617100	Even though the residents have long gone, I must remain.
8617100	8623100	Uh, why though? I have not been damned. Damned?
8623100	8629100	It was not worth the effort. Worth the effort.
8629100	8639100	Oh, it's beautiful.
8649100	8655100	Ah, reporting for duty. I saw that you spoke with the guardian of this element.
8655100	8659100	I will not escort you until you reach your dormitory.
8659100	8671100	Um, what?
8671100	8675100	It's not very good at following me.
8675100	8679100	Are you just going to follow me? Yes.
8679100	8683100	Until you safely reach a building of your destination.
8683100	8689100	Okay, we'll go in here.
8689100	8695100	Looks like they're evacuating a few tamed robots we have here.
8695100	8707100	It's gonna take Nico out.
8707100	8709100	Hello.
8709100	8717100	Makes sense. No point in keeping them in the barrens if all the people are already gone.
8717100	8723100	I wonder if the engineer is going to...
8723100	8729100	Apparently phase one of the evacuation ended prematurely.
8729100	8735100	The big ships started malfunctioning only after a few round trips.
8735100	8741100	They said it was due to something with squares.
8741100	8744100	I'm not sure what they mean by that.
8744100	8754100	Bummer. Looks like they won't be able to transport most of these surplus bots to the city at this rate.
8754100	8758100	And we worked so hard on those.
8758100	8766100	I suppose the robots are busy enough with the transporting people as is.
8766100	8772100	I think it's going to be our turn soon.
8772100	8776100	It's a parcel, I think. There's writing on this one too.
8776100	8789100	It says Guardian of Residential Area.
8789100	8802100	I'm scared of ladders.
8802100	8814100	Hmm.
8814100	8830100	Some of the ink in this page is faded.
8830100	8837100	Likely due to some sort of electrical and magnetic interference.
8837100	8841100	I'm afraid this operation can no longer be sustained.
8841100	8848100	If the servers continue to fail, so much that maintenance cannot keep up the pace.
8848100	8852100	Fortunately it does not seem to be happening to the robots.
8852100	8860100	At least not at a significant rate. Time to tell.
8860100	8868100	All of these terminals are not good. I'm not sure what to do now.
8868100	8874100	Check it. Check it. Terminals does not respond. This is a problem.
8882100	8888100	You can't catch me.
8888100	8894100	I remember being taught in school how the water is surrounding the forest,
8894100	8902100	stretched until the boundaries.
8902100	8905100	Boundaries. The word just does not look right here.
8905100	8908100	I don't know why. It just doesn't look right.
8908100	8912100	Boundaries of space.
8912100	8924100	But at some point, the fifth prehistoric oceans resend.
8924100	8934100	Forming what is now the parents. I wonder where all that water went.
8934100	8959100	A picture of a robot.
8959100	8963100	A picture of a robot.
8963100	8967100	You know, I've never been around so many robots before, Azora.
8967100	8974100	Or any robots at all. I mean, I've seen them in cartoons and stuff.
8974100	8980100	But I've never seen one in person. They're pretty neat. They're pretty neat.
8980100	8985100	Don't you think?
8985100	8989100	I need to go do a robot voice.
8989100	8995100	What? Did I talk like a robot?
8995100	8999100	Be boop. Be boop.
8999100	9004100	Be boop. I'm a robot. Be boop.
9004100	9015100	I'm a robot and I eat batteries instead of normal people food.
9015100	9018100	He's so cute.
9018100	9025100	That is not Greg.
9025100	9031100	Robots do not consume batteries in the same way people consume food.
9031100	9043100	In fact, robots do not possess digestive systems. Some robots do not even have mouths.
9043100	9054100	Azora.
9054100	9065100	I'm sorry, Nika. I'm so sorry.
9065100	9079100	You made me look sorry.
9079100	9101100	I'm so cute.
9101100	9106100	I'm sorry, Nika.
9106100	9113100	Hello. Hi. What are you doing up there?
9113100	9121100	I'm stationed here by yourself. Yes.
9121100	9128100	Azora? Yeah, nothing else to say?
9128100	9139100	Is that it? Alright. It's cool.
9139100	9142100	Hello, organic person who is alive.
9142100	9147100	An infirmary is a bad infirmary.
9147100	9153100	Reporting for duty, it seems that you already have an assigned escort.
9153100	9157100	Would you like me to leave? You can follow me if you want.
9157100	9166100	Understood. I will now escort you until you reach your dormitory.
9166100	9173100	Doctor. Hello, person of organic makeup.
9173100	9178100	Welcome to the infirmary. Scanning for injuries?
9178100	9185100	Scan complete. Ender is detected? None. Treatment required? None. You're good to go.
9185100	9189100	Thanks.
9189100	9193100	What's this? The box of medical clothes?
9193100	9200100	Most of them are broken or rested beyond you, but this plastic syringe seems to be okay.
9200100	9203100	Cool. Hello, person.
9203100	9208100	Are you seeking admission to the infirmary? No?
9208100	9212100	Oh. Carry on then.
9212100	9219100	Anyone up there?
9219100	9225100	Anyone up here? No one up there?
9225100	9230100	Hey.
9231100	9239100	Was I in this building already? 118? I was.
9239100	9244100	It's in this one.
9244100	9251100	Hey sweetie. Six more weeks until you can come home. About time, huh?
9251100	9256100	Gosh. I can't imagine living in that awful capsule wall.
9256100	9261100	Dorm. Thing. But guess what?
9261100	9271100	Soon you'll get to sleep in a real bed and eat real food again. Right back soon. Love, mom.
9277100	9285100	Looks like we're supposed to pack stuff for the evacuation starting today. I wish these books weren't so heavy.
9285100	9298100	It's gonna be a pain to carry them onto the ship, but there by the author, I can't just throw them away.
9298100	9303100	Anyone up here? No.
9303100	9314100	Anyone up here? No.
9314100	9317100	Let's go bowling.
9317100	9327100	Are you guys not supposed to go into buildings? Correct. We are built for outdoor use only.
9327100	9338100	And during buildings is not part of our programming. That's strange. Excuse me.
9338100	9349100	Is this evacuation? As such short notice, I can't believe this. First the sun dies, and now I'm out of a job.
9349100	9357100	Some sort of medical, mechanical drying.
9357100	9363100	A robot beyond repair.
9368100	9379100	We are a cat person because that is what the prophet told. We have no choice.
9379100	9388100	Honestly, I shall accept your fate.
9388100	9394100	Nothing down here.
9398100	9416100	It's a lot over here.
9416100	9422100	Am I forgetting something? Am I supposed to do something over here?
9423100	9436100	This vent is on the ground. All the others are taller than me.
9436100	9441100	Are these syringe?
9441100	9449100	The vent is on the ground. No, not syringe.
9449100	9465100	A bottle? I guess you want to fill the bottle with the gas, Sarah? Yeah. I don't want to do it.
9466100	9476100	Initially the amount of noxious fumes emitted by the natural gas vents caught our team of guard.
9476100	9481100	Thank goodness the medical team reacted as quickly as they did.
9481100	9495100	Despite its failure, that the first expedition did bring up some interesting observations about the parents, we found that there is not one but two such vent songs.
9495100	9505100	With fumes being pumped out at such high concentrations, it seems a miracle that the gas hasn't spread anywhere else.
9505100	9512100	Our biologists concluded that the phosphorus wrench.
9512100	9525100	Phosphor shrimp and the creator pools were actively consuming the gas. The shrimp in the ocean also prevent the gas from laughting off into the cleans.
9525100	9533100	If that's the case, then we owe a lot to these little guys.
9533100	9548100	What's that?
9549100	9553100	Hello? Can we go back now?
9553100	9556100	E, what's over there?
9556100	9561100	Was I here already? I feel like I was.
9561100	9565100	I guess not. What the heck is that?
9565100	9569100	Anything else over here? A robot.
9569100	9581100	Sky's dark. That it is. Do you know when the sun will be back up? We're working on it.
9581100	9585100	What is this?
9585100	9594100	Pond sure looks different, but it looks like jelly. It's formed a bubble over the surface of the pond.
9595100	9601100	Is that what this is for?
9601100	9613100	So, fulfilling all the syringes are, I guess it's kind of like a funnel, but the liquid might be a bit too thick to fit in the needle.
9613100	9619100	Hey, it actually went in. Gross.
9624100	9642100	So, should I inject the liquid through the cork, right, Azora? Yeah, it's like I'm a doctor.
9642100	9647100	Oh, I should probably shake this too.
9647100	9651100	Change color.
9651100	9676100	A bottle of acid.
9676100	9682100	It reminds you of that food segment of ASMR.
9682100	9686100	A cookie eating.
9686100	9689100	Where is he?
9689100	9691100	It's a robot.
9691100	9694100	That's a place right there.
9694100	9700100	A mirror hanging there.
9700100	9705100	A bottle of acid.
9705100	9710100	A sponge. I guess you want me to pour this acid into a sponge?
9710100	9714100	Because I have these gloves.
9714100	9716100	I hope this works.
9716100	9724100	Oh, it's a sponge.
9724100	9729100	Alright, I'll still have no other choice.
9729100	9734100	What a funny robot.
9734100	9737100	There. How's that?
9737100	9741100	I can move again. Thank you.
9741100	9743100	Little heart.
9743100	9747100	I'm able to fulfill my purpose again.
9747100	9749100	Where would you like to go?
9749100	9751100	Can you take me to the tower?
9751100	9752100	Calculating.
9752100	9758100	Of course, the destination to the tower is the Glen Port.
9758100	9761100	My build and navigation circuits are fried.
9761100	9765100	I'm gonna assume that's not good.
9765100	9768100	But it's not good at all.
9768100	9771100	Once again, I cannot follow my programming.
9771100	9774100	Is there anything I can do to help?
9774100	9777100	If I end up in here, I should speak to the head engineer.
9777100	9780100	She will know what to do.
9780100	9792100	I'm assuming that redhead lady or redhead person.
9792100	9794100	Redhead man?
9794100	9798100	Redhead man. Redhead person.
9798100	9805100	Red, redhead.
9805100	9808100	Fast, fast, fast travel.
9808100	9811100	You're right.
9811100	9813100	I forgot.
9813100	9819100	I forgot.
9819100	9822100	Excuse me again, Miss.
9822100	9823100	Miss.
9823100	9826100	Good-bye, lady.
9826100	9830100	I found a robot who can take me towards the tower.
9830100	9833100	But, maverick's in trouble.
9833100	9835100	Well, tell me to talk to you.
9835100	9837100	Alright, what is the issue?
9837100	9841100	Is there something about navigation circuits being fried?
9841100	9843100	Just the navigation circuit?
9843100	9844100	Apparently.
9844100	9847100	Sir and I fixed everything else, I think.
9847100	9850100	I have something that may help.
9850100	9852100	Robots.
9852100	9854100	Robots.
9854100	9859100	Robo, robo.
9859100	9866100	How the ability to trace material from their source locations.
9866100	9868100	Have you let the robot borrow this,
9868100	9871100	and this backup tracking system should activate?
9871100	9872100	Ah.
9877100	9879100	That's a very pretty necklace.
9879100	9880100	What's it made of?
9880100	9882100	amber
9882100	9884100	found from the glen
9884100	9886100	what's the thing inside the amber
9886100	9888100	black clover
9888100	9890100	that's a common plant in our world
9890100	9892100	it's also
9896100	9900100	I'm not sure if I can bear the part with this
9900100	9902100	my programming says yes
9902100	9906100	but I still feel complicated
9906100	9908100	a robot that feels
9908100	9910100	feelings
9920100	9922100	you need to finish your mission
9922100	9924100	more than I need to keep saying
9924100	9926100	here
9926100	9928100	thank you
9938100	9940100	what a cute jingle
9940100	9942100	before I go
9942100	9944100	is there anything I can do in return
9944100	9946100	actually
9946100	9948100	you know how to play chess
9948100	9950100	yeah
9950100	9952100	well, Florida
9952100	9954100	I played it with some older kids before
9954100	9956100	then will you play a game with me
9956100	9958100	I mean
9958100	9960100	I don't know the rules very well
9960100	9962100	but I guess it's the least I can do
9962100	9964100	really good at this
9964100	9966100	thank you
9966100	9968100	it was built into my code
9968100	9970100	ah
9970100	9972100	so
9972100	9974100	what's it like being a robot and all
9974100	9976100	I've talked to other robots
9976100	9978100	and
9978100	9980100	they all say something about programming
9980100	9982100	and code and stuff
9982100	9984100	even you did just now
9984100	9986100	it's a little hard to understand sometimes
9986100	9988100	I know
9988100	9990100	I know
9990100	9992100	most of the robots here are
9992100	9994100	not tamed
9994100	9996100	tamed
9996100	9998100	watch out
9998100	10000100	here goes my bishop
10000100	10002100	taming
10002100	10004100	it's complicated
10004100	10006100	oh
10006100	10008100	how complicated exactly
10010100	10012100	there goes my other bishop
10012100	10014100	niko ma go da chas
10014100	10016100	I mean
10016100	10018100	neither
10018100	10020100	I'm horrible at it
10020100	10022100	I'm good at checkers
10022100	10024100	is that count
10024100	10026100	I like checkers
10030100	10032100	I can't really explain
10032100	10034100	what tamed robots are
10034100	10036100	but
10036100	10038100	I'm one of them
10040100	10042100	all the other tamed robots
10042100	10044100	move to other regions
10044100	10046100	exactly where
10046100	10048100	I don't know
10048100	10050100	oh
10052100	10054100	there goes my little horse
10054100	10056100	knight
10056100	10058100	right
10058100	10060100	wow
10064100	10066100	a feeling robot
10066100	10068100	my dream
10068100	10070100	wow
10072100	10074100	I have to go now
10074100	10076100	I have a good dream
10076100	10078100	thank you and have a good day
10078100	10080100	or night
10080100	10082100	hope to see you soon
10082100	10084100	checkers are fun too
10084100	10086100	it is
10086100	10088100	very fun
10088100	10090100	I like checkers
10090100	10092100	just as hard
10092100	10094100	my memory
10094100	10096100	it's very bad
10096100	10098100	so I can't really remember rules
10098100	10100100	easy
10100100	10102100	oh
10102100	10104100	have you ever been to any other regions
10104100	10106100	I heard that there's two more
10106100	10108100	in the past
10108100	10110100	yes
10110100	10112100	I have the data
10112100	10114100	the coordinates
10114100	10116100	the coordinates
10116100	10118100	the memories
10118100	10120100	I don't know how much of that still holds true
10122100	10124100	the world
10124100	10126100	the world may be very different
10126100	10128100	place now
10128100	10130100	the sun is gone
10130100	10132100	no
10132100	10134100	I said this already, didn't I
10134100	10136100	the sun probably won't save the world
10136100	10138100	the decaying started back
10138100	10140100	before the sun went out
10140100	10142100	the sun's sudden death
10142100	10144100	was just the tipping point
10144100	10146100	and things went south really fast
10146100	10148100	after that
10148100	10150100	oh
10150100	10152100	then there's nothing I can do
10152100	10154100	check
10154100	10156100	what?
10156100	10158100	the only thing you can do
10158100	10160100	is complete your
10160100	10162100	pilgrimage
10162100	10164100	in a way
10164100	10166100	you're only supposed to be a second chance for the people
10168100	10170100	just like how the barons
10170100	10172100	was only supposed to be a second chance for me
10172100	10174100	there's no guarantee
10174100	10176100	that things will work out
10176100	10178100	but
10178100	10180100	checkmate
10180100	10182100	alright
10182100	10184100	guess I've kept you long enough
10184100	10186100	thank you for listening

10198100	10200100	off you go

10202100	10204100	am I able to go
10206100	10208100	to this right side of this area
10210100	10212100	will they take me
10212100	10214100	or is that a no
10216100	10218100	safety violation
10220100	10222100	take me I want to go
10222100	10224100	I want to see
10224100	10226100	will I ever be able to go over there

10268100	10270100	have you talked to the head engineer yet
10270100	10272100	he lives in the main mine entrance
10272100	10274100	I would have given up on
10274100	10276100	what
10276100	10278100	I did
10282100	10284100	that's not what I meant to do
10288100	10290100	oh this is amber
10290100	10292100	from the glen
10292100	10294100	I can remember now
10294100	10296100	activating tracking system
10296100	10298100	setting course
10298100	10300100	wait
10300100	10302100	this boat
10302100	10304100	is over capacity
10304100	10306100	you'll need to leave behind
10306100	10308100	some of your possession
10308100	10310100	oh well
10310100	10312100	I don't think I'll be needing this crowbar anymore
10312100	10314100	for this gas mag
10316100	10318100	this is acceptable
10318100	10320100	onwards we go
10320100	10322100	I don't know
10322100	10324100	row row row
10324100	10326100	your boat down lay down
10326100	10328100	a stream
10328100	10330100	merrily merrily merrily
10330100	10332100	life is but a dream
10332100	10334100	so cute
10338100	10340100	oh shit
10346100	10348100	here's your stop

10354100	10356100	thank you
10358100	10360100	you should be a village to the north

10362100	10364100	that's good to know
10364100	10366100	farewell
10366100	10368100	may your mission be a success
10368100	10370100	are you leaving
10370100	10372100	yes I must return to my station
10374100	10376100	but you'll be all alone again
10376100	10378100	it's okay
10378100	10380100	I have not been tamed
10388100	10390100	I think
10390100	10392100	water
10396100	10398100	oh
10406100	10408100	there's two doors
10422100	10424100	was there anything else over there
10424100	10426100	was that they scared me
10426100	10428100	they're running in a circle
10432100	10434100	I think
10434100	10436100	I think
10438100	10440100	I think we'll call it
10440100	10442100	for today
10442100	10444100	for one shot
10446100	10448100	I will play the rest tomorrow
10448100	10450100	yeah
10460100	10462100	since we're in a new place now
10462100	10464100	I think they said when we leave
10466100	10468100	it automatically saves yes
10468100	10470100	I think
10476100	10478100	yeah
10480100	10482100	you should auto save
10484100	10486100	excellent
10486100	10488100	that's good
10492100	10494100	we can sit and chat for a little bit

10498100	10500100	we can chat for a little bit
10500100	10502100	but
10502100	10504100	we'll stop the game here
10504100	10506100	right now
10512100	10514100	this action will record your progress in this world
10516100	10518100	to return to this world again
10518100	10520100	we need to relaunch
10520100	10522100	the app
10522100	10524100	we'll see it
10524100	10526100	yes

10554100	10556100	a lot of things I don't remember
10556100	10558100	while playing

10662100	10664100	or I was probably told
10664100	10666100	and I forgot
10668100	10670100	so I can't really tell you
10676100	10678100	so if you want to know that
10678100	10680100	information

10730100	10732100	but
10732100	10734100	as it feels
10734100	10736100	like a habit
10736100	10738100	where I need to whisper
10740100	10742100	but I lie

10798100	10800100	I can't stop
10804100	10806100	I'm used to whispering
10808100	10810100	being your natural voice
10810100	10812100	I don't naturally
10812100	10814100	I don't normally whisper
10814100	10816100	but

11899780	11902020	i just add random stuff to the
11902820	11912980	the list i have a mini fridge in my my my my room uh because uh i need to store some of my medication in a fridge
11912980	11920100	and it's better to have it close behind so i have some water and some drinks that i can get to really fast
11920820	11922260	in the mini fridge
11922260	11926580	but i've had this mini fridge for so long that it mount my functions every now and then
11927220	11935380	so i added that to the throw list i just added whatever i already kind of have but i know it's broken or whatever
11935780	11942100	so i'm like hi i guess i can add this all right it's whatever here you go put that there
11942820	11948500	i didn't want to have the the thrown empty so i added random stuff
11950740	11952740	so
11965780	11968100	we need a code word for it is more

12024340	12031700	i don't know what's up with the bias i have no clue either but it's fine i don't mind it i have no complaints
12033140	12037300	i just like being given the chance to stream overhaul for you guys
12040180	12045140	if youtube uh wants to come after us then it's fine that is what it is
12045700	12047700	yes
12049860	12053940	yeah i think it's a fruitless battle to try and fight it
12057300	12066260	but if uh stroney and everyone wants to fight it i will be there by their side regardless of it all
12068580	12070580	fighting

12100580	12103380	funny snuggle time fitness
12105940	12109700	maybe it's because they're live streams probably most likely
12112660	12118660	to be honest i think i got hit mid of that stream like in the middle of it because um
12120420	12122420	in the middle of the stream
12123380	12130420	uh no one could search me up for some reason uh some of my

12197620	12203620	i do know how to uh download it but unfortunately if a video gets taken down you can't
12204260	12212420	download it i i already tried it won't let you video is gone completely if a video gets taken down
12214900	12217540	you cannot download it um well
12221300	12222180	where
12227380	12229620	time to find a way to get Johnny to own youtube
12231300	12235540	you gotta make her rich and then she can pay it by a
12237220	12241060	no it's gonna cost like a trillion billion dollars or something
12241060	12247540	um
12250420	12253620	no matter what youtube does i'll still be here by a mama's side

12271620	12283540	no totally happens a lot to be a lower girl yeah
12286820	12293540	me either thankfully someone else archived it yep i'm also thankful for that too
12293860	12306340	yes the option though doesn't always the option to record and stream i would have to remember to click the button
12306900	12310020	it doesn't just ask you to do both uh
12312100	12318580	and i don't really have the memory to always press that button i wanted to record it
12319140	12326980	yesterday i'm fully aware that i can record it but that um uh i cannot help
12328100	12332740	if i don't remember so i'm really sorry about that

12341380	12356740	i just leave the archiving to your bleeding heart thank you i appreciate that
12361300	12368100	i could be uh cpu intensive depending on your pc

12375620	12379300	won't know until i do it right

12606900	12613940	to put it in my eye i also learned do not put eyedrops in if the bottle is cold try to get the
12613940	12620980	liquid a little warm a little bit warmer before putting in your eyes cold liquid in your eye
12620980	12629940	does not feel good it does not feel good at all it almost feels like it you have pressure on your eye
