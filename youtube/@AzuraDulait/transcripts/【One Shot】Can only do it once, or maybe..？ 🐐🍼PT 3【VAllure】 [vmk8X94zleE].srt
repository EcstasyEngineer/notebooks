I went live. It was so weird.

24
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,320
I went live and then all of a sudden my internet just died.

25
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,320
My internet just ceased to exist for a minute.

26
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,320
What happened to you two?

27
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,320

00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,320

I didn't eat it. It was too burnt.

39
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
It was like badly burnt.

40
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,320
When I tried to take it off,

41
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,320
take it off of the foil,

42
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,320
it was like sticking to it.

43
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,320
It was like as it feel it,

44
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,320

00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,320

89
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:56,000
mine decided to make toast yeah i think i was sleeping when this happened i don't remember where i was

90
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:07,520
i just know i was in my room i was in my room i was in my room having a good time doing whatever

91
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:14,800
i was doing aki but then all of a sudden i smelled something it smelled

92
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,520
it smelled like fire fire where's that smoke

93
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,920
what's that what what i gotta go check it out

94
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:42,800
so i get up and i open my door and then a huge cloud of gray smoke fills my room

95
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,720
the entire ceiling is covered in smoke

96
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:57,600
the entire ceiling is covered in smoke and i had to bend down and walk all the way to the kitchen

97
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,000
to see what the heck happened

98
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:13,920
i go into the the the kitchen and there my sibling is coming out of their room at the same time

99
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:21,680
and we we both walk in there together and i'm like what the heck's going on why is there smoke

100
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,120
what's going on and they were like i was making toast

101
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,280
we're like toast that's the toaster and then we go in there and then there's more smoke

102
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:45,120
spewing out of the toaster spewing out of the toaster

103
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:57,120
so for like a couple of years before this incident our toaster was actually broken

104
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:05,040
it was broken for like a couple of years every time you push the toaster down every now and then

105
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,720
the button doesn't come back up so the toaster would stay on even if the timer was over

106
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,840
it didn't pop pop pop back up so

107
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,640
it was like rule of thumb not to leave the toaster when when you make toast but

108
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,520
i think in between the time it was broken and the incident it was working for a little bit

109
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:39,520
so my sibling left the toaster alone with the toast and forgot about it

110
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:54,640
so yeah um when uh when we got to the toaster

111
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,480
we got to the toaster um my sibling popped the toaster out

112
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:14,000
popped the toast out and it was black like charred like it looked like charcoal

113
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,120
it looked like burning charcoal the center was a little like little grayish but it was

114
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,880
like it looked like magma in the center like in the very very center it looked like

115
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:34,720
it was like bubbling and popping in the center of the of the toast of the now charcoal bread

116
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:44,320
it was it was it was like bubbling and popping my my my sibling took it out with a like

117
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,680
they tried to use their like hand and it was too hot so they used an oven mat

118
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,920
and they pulled it out with the oven mat and then the oven mat caught fire yeah

119
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,920
so

120
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,920
and we haven't had a toaster since

121
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,680
no toaster

122
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,120
okay

123
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,480
let me add a toaster oven i'm not really sure what happened to that one

124
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,120
it just disappeared i went in there one day to make me a toaster and it was gone

125
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,160
so we don't own a toaster or a toaster oven but someone got us a toaster on throw now

126
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:03,360
so yay we'll we'll have a toaster i'll have a toaster again i can make toast normally

127
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,600
yay

128
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,480
make sure no fires occur i'll just i'll just keep the toaster in my room

129
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,280
i don't want my sibling to come asking to make toast

130
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:34,880
i think the reason why the old toaster broke was because people forced it to pop you know how you

131
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,680
push the pop button up and it will pop um not a lot of toasters are designed to do that

132
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,920
so i think

133
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:52,400
i think uh i think they broke it by doing that so i'm afraid of of leaving the new one in there

134
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,360
and them doing that again

135
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:12,160
so they um and broke it perfect the toaster i have molts and hot toast yeah it's not the first time

136
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,280
it's not the first time we had a fire though yeah we had a fire a couple of times

137
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,560
um in this house in this house

138
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
i'll show you guys if i want to hear about that

139
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:53,360
yeah a couple of times yeah

140
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,040
here you go my lips are a little dry

141
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:06,000
oh yeah put this on my lips yeah we had a few fires

142
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,000
so

143
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,320
some of them were accidental

144
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,880
there's no way to sound on my internet

145
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,600
it keeps going on and off it's gone again

146
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,360
it's back again

147
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,680

00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:51,140
various other ethnicities, cultures

236
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,140

00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,140
you want to know my original accent?

251
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,140
no one that's underneath it all

252
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,140
my original accent is actually southern

253
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,140
yeah

254
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,140

255
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,140
no

256
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,140
my family is though

257
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,140
but they moved

258
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,140
and my family has

259
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,140
the accent

260
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,140
it kind of goes down a few generations before it disappears

261
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,140
and it's kind of going with me

262
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,140
so because

263
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,140
my family have all of them have

264
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,140
a southern accent

00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,140

01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:19,500
I think it was my birthday.

687
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:26,500
Because people always get their favorite food on their birthdays.

688
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:41,500
I remember my birthdays, they sucked really badly.

689
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:45,500
I get a little emotional when it comes to birthdays.

690
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:52,500
My birthday was always forgotten.

691
01:14:52,500 --> 01:15:02,500
My birthday was forgotten for 3-4 years straight in a row.

692
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:14,500
A whole lot of it.

693
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:17,500
Do you have a birthday?

694
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,500
I do.

695
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:24,500
It's August 21st.

696
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:32,500
August 24th.

697
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:35,500
Oh, accidentally.

698
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:42,500
Where's that?

699
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,500
Yes, I do.

700
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,500
Oh, then what's your favorite food?

701
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,500
Is it pancakes?

702
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,500
Wait, do you like pancakes?

703
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,500
I do.

704
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,500
Yes, me too.

705
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:01,500
On my last birthday, I ate two of them.

706
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:02,500
So many.

707
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:06,500
I was so full I didn't eat anything else that day.

708
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:10,500
But you're telling her, be careful.

709
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:18,500
It's so much, you're telling her.

710
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,500
We won't regret it.

711
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,500
I hope you won't.

712
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,500
Thank you.

713
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:28,500
Thank you everyone.

714
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,500
You have it on your calendar.

715
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,500
Yay.

716
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:41,500
Yeah, no birthday for 3 years.

717
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:51,500
Yes, it's my day of creation.

718
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:55,500
My mama makes the best packets.

719
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,500
And some of the neighbors make really good noodles.

720
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:02,500
My mom made the best oatmeal.

721
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:11,500
It was mostly my grandma's oatmeal.

722
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,500
She made it with absolute love.

723
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,500
I don't know how she did it.

724
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:21,500
We don't know what her secret ingredient was and we'll never know.

725
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:26,500
All we can do is experiment and see if we can get it to taste the same.

726
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:30,500
There's just no way we can ever get it to taste the same.

727
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:35,500
So my mom's oatmeal came in second.

728
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:40,500
It was close, very close enough to it.

729
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:55,500
It was my favorite food that she would make.

730
01:17:55,500 --> 01:18:01,500
Oh, one of our neighbors makes a lot of bread.

731
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:10,500
Bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread.

732
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,500
Do you have any neighbors?

733
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,500
Yeah, they're kind of them.

734
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:15,500
They're great.

735
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:21,500
I like my neighbors so much.

736
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,500
Good neighbors.

737
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:31,500
Well, one of them is actually a really, really good neighbor.

738
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,500
She's a sweetheart.

739
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:37,500
A really, really old lady.

740
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:40,500
Really, really old lady.

741
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:43,500
Sweetheart.

742
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,500
Yes.

743
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:48,500
Oh, do they share their food with you?

744
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,500
She used to, not anymore.

745
01:18:51,500 --> 01:19:05,500
Now she comes over and asks if we have sugar to lend or a roll of toilet paper.

746
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,500
I guess I'll say no.

747
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:11,500
It's been years since then, since we last shared.

748
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:14,500
We're the ones that share food with her now.

749
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:25,500
Whenever we have big events and stuff, we'll make a supper plate for her and give it to her.

750
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:30,500
Such as I know her, yes.

751
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:34,500
Since it's an occasional thing and she doesn't share food with us.

752
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,500
We share food with her.

753
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,500
Yeah, they say no.

754
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,500
They say no.

755
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,500
It's not very nice of them.

756
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:55,500
It's true.

757
01:19:55,500 --> 01:20:01,500
Our neighbors and my mama take turns making food at the whole village each day.

758
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,500
That's sweet.

759
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:10,500
Aw.

760
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:14,500
I still tell a little white lie.

761
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,500
Nah.

762
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,500
I tell the truth.

763
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:23,500
I'm really actually really bad at telling lies.

764
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:26,500
It's not my forte.

765
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,500
But I do like trolling.

766
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:33,500
It's my favorite thing to do.

767
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:46,500
I'm not really good at lying, but I do like trolling.

768
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:50,500
Everyone also takes turns doing chores and watching the little kids.

769
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:58,500
It sounds like a very nice village.

770
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,500
I don't need to be watched anymore though.

771
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,500
I'm old enough to help out.

772
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:06,500
Yeah, you are. You're a big boy now.

773
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,500
Big boy Nico.

774
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,500
You're a big boy.

775
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,500
You are so cute.

776
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,500
I miss everyone.

777
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,500
Aw.

778
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:28,500
I've been gone for a while now, haven't I?

779
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:31,500
I wonder if they're worried about me.

780
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:36,500
Speaking of helping out, I should probably go now.

781
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,500
Right.

782
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,500
Do I have to take a nap?

783
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,500
How do you run again?

784
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,500
Yeah.

785
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,500
Alright.

786
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:50,500
So where I left off, I was trying to figure out how do you...

787
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:55,500
Oh yeah, I need scissors.

788
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:04,500
Where get scissors?

789
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,500
Wait, this is a bakery, right?

790
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,500
This is like a cafe.

791
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:18,500
I need scissors to, I think, cut the tape.

792
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:22,500
But where the heck do you get scissors from?

793
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,500
Okay.

794
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,500
Probably I'm missing something.

795
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,500
Oh.

796
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:14,500
Does this person do anything?

797
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,500
Like, do I, like, give her something?

798
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,500
No, I think I already tried that.

799
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:34,500
I'm not very good at lying.

800
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:52,500
Then you're probably going to answer the personality quiz and mystery dungeon, honestly.

801
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,500
Most likely.

802
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,500
Okay.

803
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:23,500
Where the heck do you get scissors from?

804
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,500
Wait a minute.

805
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:32,500
I think I saw an extra room. Was it an extra room?

806
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,500
Is this the library?

807
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:38,500
Yeah, that one was this room, I know.

808
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:42,500
I saw a hallway or something.

809
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:44,500
This.

810
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,500
Oh!

811
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:49,500
A room I haven't been in!

812
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,500
Scissors.

813
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,500
The pair of scissors on the ground.

814
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,500
A pile of hair.

815
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:01,500
I don't think anyone's using this anymore.

816
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,500
The sink.

817
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:17,500
Soap dispenser.

818
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,500
I found scissors.

819
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:29,500
Hm, hahaha.

01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:29,500
How are we gonna connect it to the elevator?

825
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,500
So, let's find out.

826
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:43,500
Okay, let's save this one there.

827
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:53,500
What if we just fold the magnet under this edge?

828
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,500
And it's holding together just barely.

829
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,500
How does this go on now?

830
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,500
And what's the tape for?

831
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:06,500
Save this one there.

832
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,500
Oh, of course.

833
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,500
I had to tape it together or it might fall apart.

834
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,500
Yeah?

835
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,500
I'm thinking, sir.

836
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:14,500
I'm smart!

837
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,500
You know that?

838
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,500
I'm so smart.

839
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,500
Look at me.

840
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,500
I'm so smart.

841
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,500
Yeah, so now we can go to the surface.

842
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:43,500
Oh!

843
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:54,500
Reactivating elevator services.

844
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:57,500
Please input security code to continue.

845
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,500
What?

846
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,500
What's never happened before?

847
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:01,500
The squares?

848
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,500
Huh?

849
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:03,500
You saw them, right?

850
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:05,500
They were on the door and...

851
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,500
Oh, no.

852
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:08,500
The scores have happened all the time.

853
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,500
I meant the whole security code thing.

854
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,500
But then again, the elevator hasn't been as broken before.

855
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,500
Hmm.

856
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:20,500
I guess we should go look for a code, is there a?

857
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,500
Yeah, let's go look for a code.

858
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,500
I broke it.

859
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,500
Security code to continue.

860
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:30,500
Oh.

861
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,500
Access denied.

862
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,500
Can I help with anything?

863
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:36,500
Anyhow.

864
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:38,500
Things are unproductive for so long.

865
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:40,500
It's really...

866
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:46,500
Thank you.

867
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,500
Thank you so much.

868
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,500
I'm going to head out for the five dollar tip.

869
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,500
Thank you, thank you.

870
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,500
What?

871
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,500
Yeah, they're super jealous.

872
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:03,500
They want a piece of this bread and they can't have it.

873
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,500
Sorry.

874
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,500
It's really getting to me.

875
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:10,500
I think it's Zora and I got an handle.

876
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,500
What do you think, Zora?

877
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:19,500
It's on the standard.

878
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,500
It's on these random codes.

879
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:26,500
Maybe you could just try out some numbers until you get it?

880
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:30,500
Alright, I suppose that's better than doing nothing.

881
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:31,500
Let's see.

882
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,500
Yep, gonna be here for a while.

883
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:41,500
You aren't seriously doing this, are you?

884
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,500
Which way was it to that door?

885
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,500
Oh, it's upright.

886
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,500
I think I have to get it from up here.

887
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,500
Wait, should I go check on plant?

888
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,500
Plant lady?

889
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,500
Is plant lady okay?

890
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:11,500
I have access...

891
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:15,500
I have the code from last time, I think, do I?

892
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:18,500
Do I?

893
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,500
I do! You're right!

894
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,500
I do, I do, I do.

895
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,500
Is she okay?

896
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,500
Alright, she's okay.

897
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:38,500
Yeah, the film, the film!

898
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,500
The film!

899
01:30:40,500 --> 01:31:04,500
It was 6304.

900
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,500
6304.

901
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:09,500
I'm gonna move myself out of the way a little more.

902
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,500
No?

903
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,500
Yeah.

904
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:45,500
Can't find him.

905
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,500
Hang on one moment.

906
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:57,500
Hit.

907
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:58,500
Hit.

908
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,500
Oh my goodness.

909
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,500
6304.

910
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,500
What?

911
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,500
Yeah.

912
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:30,500
What?

913
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,500
It works!

914
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:35,500
I don't know what you did, but it actually works.

915
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,500
Good job, Kat.

916
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,500
You're a genius, you know that?

917
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,500
And I hope for Missouri, too.

918
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,500
I think, I think...

919
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,500
Oh, right.

920
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,500
The whole Messiah business.

921
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,500
Anyway, ready to go?

922
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:53,500
Bye bye.

923
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:55,500
Wait.

924
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,500
Doesn't he do one last thing here?

925
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,500
Don't be afraid to ask if you're hungry.

926
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:15,500
I don't get a pancake or a Nikko.

927
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:18,500
I thought I got a pancake for a Nikko.

928
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:22,500
I think I hear my door.

929
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,500
Hang on, I hear my door.

930
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,500
Give me one second.

931
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,500
Give me one second, give me one second.

932
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,500
Hang on, I hear my door.

933
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:31,500
Give me one second.

934
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:33,500
Give me one second, give me one second.

935
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,500
No, that wasn't my door.

936
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,500
That was just someone else out there.

937
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,500
I got tricked.

938
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,500
I was tricked.

939
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,500
I was tricked.

940
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:20,500
I was tricked.

941
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:22,500
I was tricked.

942
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:24,500
I was tricked.

943
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,500
I was tricked.

944
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,500
I was tricked.

945
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,500
I was tricked.

946
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,500
Oh, hey. Welcome back.

947
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,500
That shirt took you a while, huh?

948
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,500
Oh shoot, you've been waiting this whole time.

949
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:41,500
I wasn't gone that long!

950
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,500
And holding the door open.

951
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,500
Well, I don't want to be rude.

952
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,500
I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that, god!

953
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,500
I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that, god!

954
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

955

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

956
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,500
Oh no!

957
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:01,500
I wasn't gone that long.

958
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:03,500
I just walked away for a tiny bit.

most of the city's stuff. Oh, we used to have a small army of delivery robots doing that, but

1015
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:42,640
lately a bunch of them have been breaking down. So until they fix them, I'll just have more work on

1016
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:51,600
my plate, and it's left into long. When will the robots get fixed? I have no idea. It's all up to the

1017
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:58,400
scientists over at the labs, but they seem really concerned about something else lately. Oh,

1018
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:08,640
never a good sign when even the smart folks are worried. All right, Zora, should I ask about the city?

1019
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:19,040
The city is very big. It's smaller than it looks. Dang, this whole conversation while we're going

1020
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:33,840
to the floor. We must be really high up. I knew you here. Welcome in. Nice to see you,

1021
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:37,040
but I'm very sure I've seen you before.

1022
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:53,680
I love to be trapped in an elevator with a Zora with you. I might ravish you.

1023
01:41:53,680 --> 01:42:08,720
Good evening, Muldor. Good evening.

1024
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:18,160
Getting pretty crowded too. First there was the refugees from the barrens, and now more

1025
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:27,840
women folks are moving into. Oh, it's a safer here, you know? I mean, it's not a haven by any means.

1026
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:34,160
That square stuff that we just saw, we have more of that here than anywhere else apparently,

1027
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:42,080
I noticed. We're lucky it only seems to affect the city's infrastructures. The land mass

1028
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:50,400
itself is still holding up, which is good since there isn't much solid land here in the first place.

1029
01:42:54,080 --> 01:43:02,880
All right, how's Zora? Should I ask about the library? Can you tell me about the library?

1030
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:09,600
I'm supposed to go there. Oh yeah, that's one of my main delivery spots.

1031
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:14,000
Those reading lights are pretty high maintenance.

1032
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:21,520
Well, I just feel out of place surrounded by smart people. Well, here's just pretty smart

1033
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:28,720
yourself, so you'll fit in line, you and Zora. I'm dumb. I don't know what he's talking about.

1034
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:38,800
I mean, no, I'm smart. I am so smart. I am intelligent. I am the brightest person ever.

1035
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,840
I am intelligent.

1036
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:57,760
Anyway, it was a nice meeting you.

1037
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,200
Right, see you around. Good, good around now.

1038
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:17,200
I guess we should hurry too. Zora, people are counting on us. Yeah, let's go find that library.

1039

Amos the robot. Beep boop. Beep boop.

Suspicious person, sigh. You all right? Uh, what was I at? Perhaps this is a sigh.

1042
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:46,080
Tell me, do you think you could fix the world with the sun? Honestly, I don't know.

1043
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:53,120
I've been getting mixed messages. I know. But what do you think? I think.

1044
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:58,400
I think I should listen to Zora. After all, Zora helped me get this far.

1045
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:04,800
That'll take your faith or an answer then. What do you mean by that? It means what

1046
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:06,800
you think it means.

1047
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:27,520
Strage man. Strage man.

1048
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,800
Strage man.

1049
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:12,800
It's fine. It's fine. I'm really scared.

1050
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:50,800
Oh, the business gave me so bad a heart. It hurt me so bad. It gave me, oh my god.

1051
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:12,160
I was so unprepared for that. My chest hurt for a second. It hurt for a split second.

1052
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:14,800
I'm fine.

1053
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:25,920
Zora, did you see what happened? Yeah, my vision went blank for a second.

1054
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:31,200
And then I saw something, like a really short dream. I don't know what that was about.

1055
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:37,200
Strage man. Strage man.

1056
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:44,240
What's up here?

1057
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:51,680
Another alleyway?

1058
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:56,880
Why should I check out over here first?

1059
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:07,520
It's a faded flyer. It's a faded flyer.

1060
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:15,200
I'm curious and marking on the ball. Looks like a round.

1061
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:16,640
He-ee.

1062
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,640
What's down here?

1063
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,840
This is strangely warm in this room.

1064
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:37,840
Oh, a cat. Are you lost? Me? Do you wish to join us?

1065
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:46,720
I want to be with the cats. I want this. It's not fair. I want this. This I want. I want.

1066
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:58,720
I want this. I want this.

1067
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:11,040
Join your cats? Yes. But I'm not a cat. I don't walk on far likes like they do.

1068
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:18,960
You have cat eyes? My eyes are normal, people eyes. Well, I'm normal back home.

1069
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:26,320
You're how to shoot like a cat. But I'm just a person. You're still welcome here.

1070
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:34,400
I protect lost people as well. Thanks. No, not lost though. You got a sword to guide me. I see.

1071
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:41,440
Why must our cat map? The cats are cute.

1072
01:49:41,440 --> 01:50:07,920
Oh, please. Do not approach.

1073
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:11,920
Oh.

1074
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:18,880
Oh, not going in there. Not yet.

1075
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:26,960
What's up here? Oh, not going in there. What's up here?

1076
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:38,640
What's this? The bag has some big plastic disc here. Looks like they're supposed to go in something.

1077
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:45,760
Wait, is there are really going to take these with us? They look so heavy. All right.

1078
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:55,680
They're actually pretty light. It's a big book. The title says understanding robots.

1079
01:50:58,160 --> 01:51:06,720
An empty glass jar with water handle. A bed. The blanket has quite a few patches.

1080
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:21,120
I don't know if I can see. There's some broken glass in there. Big coffee cups.

1081
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:25,520
A lantern plant. Hang on. I need to

1082
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:33,360
put cream on my wrist. My wrist is starting to

1083
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:45,840
hurt.

1084
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:59,840
Goodbye never a second.

1085
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:18,400
Oh.

01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:29,840

1342
02:16:39,160 --> 02:16:40,160
Just now

1343
02:17:06,480 --> 02:17:08,760
I got a rather calm heart, right?

1344
02:17:10,160 --> 02:17:12,160
Come for now

1345
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:15,160
But my issue with my heart rate is that it goes

1346
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:19,160
It becomes too slow

1347
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:22,160
So the numbers are dipping

1348
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:24,160
Don't be concerned

1349
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:26,160
It's fine

1350
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:28,160
I might feel a little faint

1351
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:29,160
But I just need to relax

1352
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:30,160
That's all

1353
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:33,160
Not the only thing you'll probably notice

1354
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:36,160
Is it dipping

1355
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:38,160
If it goes any higher

1356
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:43,160
It's probably because I took my medication

1357
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:47,160
My medication sometimes makes my heart rate go a little high

1358
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:06,160
Yeah, the heart rate monitor takes time to go up

1359
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:08,160
It doesn't go up right away

1360
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:10,160
So when I got scared it

1361
02:18:10,160 --> 02:18:14,160
It definitely went up to like 70-something

1362
02:18:14,160 --> 02:18:19,160
But it takes time to read the heart

1363
02:18:19,160 --> 02:18:21,160
Promise you'll be okay

1364
02:18:21,160 --> 02:18:24,160
I'm fine, I'll be okay

1365
02:18:29,160 --> 02:18:31,160
They don't taste too bad though

1366
02:18:31,160 --> 02:18:33,160
Do you want one?

1367
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:35,160
It's okay, thank you

1368
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:39,160
Hey, hey

1369
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:42,160
Ready for me to blow your mind?

1370
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:44,160
Yeah, okay, so

1371
02:18:44,160 --> 02:18:47,160
I've invented a machine, a medicine

1372
02:18:47,160 --> 02:18:50,160
To prepare everyone for the upcoming water shortage

1373
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:54,160
All you gotta do is dissolve one of these pills in water

1374
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:56,160
Then you drink the water

1375
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:59,160
Then you never need to drink water again

1376
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:00,160
What?

1377
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:03,160
It also makes plants grow faster

1378
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:05,160
How does it work?

1379
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:08,160
Here, why don't you take a free sample?

1380
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:10,160
Oh, thanks

1381
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:13,160
Don't thank me, go spread the word

1382
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:45,160

The library is up ahead.

1395
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:55,160
When the world ends, would it be better if it was gone and an instant are slowly fading away?

1396
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:57,160
An instant.

1397
02:20:57,160 --> 02:21:09,160
If I were to witness the world perishing, I would rather it be spontaneous.

1398
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:11,160
Boom!

1399
02:21:11,160 --> 02:21:13,160
It's fast.

1400
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:15,160
Boom!

1401
02:21:15,160 --> 02:21:17,160
It's fun.

1402
02:21:17,160 --> 02:21:19,160
I feel a thing.

1403
02:21:19,160 --> 02:21:21,160
Boom!

1404
02:21:21,160 --> 02:21:29,160
To be honest, I'd rather the former.

1405
02:21:29,160 --> 02:21:37,160
Anything over here?

1406
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:43,160
But in all honesty, I don't want it to end.

1407
02:21:43,160 --> 02:21:45,160
Or do I?

1408
02:21:45,160 --> 02:21:47,160
No, I don't want it to end.

1409
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:49,160
I don't want it to end.

1410
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:53,160
Oh, we're in the library.

1411
02:21:53,160 --> 02:21:55,160
It's a little bridge bridge.

1412
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:57,160
It's a box by the box.

1413
02:21:57,160 --> 02:21:59,160
Some sort of something.

1414
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:01,160
I have a person with white hair.

1415
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:03,160
I like your hair.

1416
02:22:03,160 --> 02:22:05,160
What?

1417
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:07,160
Well, I didn't say anything.

1418
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:09,160
Stop staring at me, then.

1419
02:22:09,160 --> 02:22:11,160
I was looking at your book.

1420
02:22:11,160 --> 02:22:13,160
Yes, you're in the library.

1421
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:17,160
There's books in the library.

1422
02:22:17,160 --> 02:22:21,160
Go bug the chatty one upstairs.

1423
02:22:21,160 --> 02:22:25,160
Others books covered a wide range of topics.

1424
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:29,160
It seems there are no subjects.

1425
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:31,160
It is not right.

1426
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:33,160
Right about.

1427
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:37,160
Quite the renaissance, man.

1428
02:22:37,160 --> 02:22:39,160
What do you think?

1429
02:22:39,160 --> 02:22:41,160
I hate this brace.

1430
02:22:41,160 --> 02:22:43,160
It makes my wrist so itchy.

1431
02:22:43,160 --> 02:22:45,160
I guess so.

1432
02:22:45,160 --> 02:22:47,160
But he's been focusing on documenting the world.

1433
02:22:47,160 --> 02:22:49,160
As a boy.

1434
02:22:49,160 --> 02:22:51,160
Oh?

1435
02:22:51,160 --> 02:22:53,160
Is it a city that's the last...

1436
02:22:53,160 --> 02:22:55,160
Beixion?

1437
02:22:55,160 --> 02:22:57,160
Beixion?

1438
02:22:57,160 --> 02:22:59,160
As a boy.

1439
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:01,160
Is it a city that's the last...

1440
02:23:01,160 --> 02:23:03,160
Beixion?

1441
02:23:03,160 --> 02:23:05,160
Beixion?

1442
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:07,160
Observation?

1443
02:23:07,160 --> 02:23:09,160
Beixion?

1444
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:11,160
Beison?

1445
02:23:11,160 --> 02:23:13,160
Beison?

1446
02:23:23,160 --> 02:23:25,160
Some of these books

1447
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:27,160
may be the only thing

1448
02:23:27,160 --> 02:23:29,160
we have to remember

1449
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:31,160
the rest of the world.

1450
02:23:33,160 --> 02:23:35,160
But our goddess wouldn't let that happen.

1451
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:37,160
The world ending?

1452
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:39,160
I'll do my best,

1453
02:23:39,160 --> 02:23:41,160
but I could barely

1454
02:23:41,160 --> 02:23:43,160
I could

1455
02:23:43,160 --> 02:23:45,160
I could barely stop a war.

1456
02:23:49,160 --> 02:23:51,160
I like lost a lot of my

1457
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:53,160
my powers.

1458
02:23:55,160 --> 02:23:57,160
I'm not as strong as I used to be.

1459
02:24:03,160 --> 02:24:05,160
I'm not as strong as I used to be.

1460
02:24:07,160 --> 02:24:09,160
Sorry, I barely could stop a war.

1461
02:24:09,160 --> 02:24:11,160
I don't think I could stop the world from ending.

1462
02:24:19,160 --> 02:24:21,160
Beison?

1463
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:23,160
Beison?

1464
02:24:23,160 --> 02:24:25,160
Beison?

1465
02:24:25,160 --> 02:24:27,160
Beison?

1466
02:24:27,160 --> 02:24:29,160
Beis-ti-on?

1467
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:31,160
Beis-ti-on?

1468
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:33,160
Ah.

1469
02:24:33,160 --> 02:24:35,160
Beis-ti-on?

1470
02:24:43,160 --> 02:24:45,160
I prefer instant death.

1471
02:24:45,160 --> 02:24:47,160
Yes.

1472
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:49,160
Yes.

1473
02:24:49,160 --> 02:24:51,160
Yes.

1474
02:24:51,160 --> 02:24:53,160
Beis-ti-on?

1475
02:24:53,160 --> 02:24:55,160
Ah.

1476
02:25:03,160 --> 02:25:05,160
Oh, hello. Do you need directions?

1477
02:25:05,160 --> 02:25:07,160
Let's see. This area here

1478
02:25:07,160 --> 02:25:09,160
is mostly historical accounts.

1479
02:25:09,160 --> 02:25:11,160
The reference section

1480
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:13,160
is downstairs.

1481
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:15,160
I'm not sure where the children's section is.

1482
02:25:15,160 --> 02:25:17,160
It's okay.

1483
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:19,160
I'm not really looking for books.

1484
02:25:19,160 --> 02:25:21,160
I'm looking to look for

1485
02:25:21,160 --> 02:25:23,160
the author then.

1486
02:25:23,160 --> 02:25:25,160
Oh, that's good.

1487
02:25:25,160 --> 02:25:27,160
I mean

1488
02:25:27,160 --> 02:25:29,160
that means you won't be disappointed

1489
02:25:29,160 --> 02:25:31,160
when volunteering here

1490
02:25:31,160 --> 02:25:33,160
for months and I've never seen him.

1491
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:35,160
I haven't once.

1492
02:25:35,160 --> 02:25:37,160
It works together with the head librarian

1493
02:25:37,160 --> 02:25:39,160
on publishing.

1494
02:25:39,160 --> 02:25:41,160
So you'd think he would at least

1495
02:25:41,160 --> 02:25:43,160
show up once in a while.

1496
02:25:43,160 --> 02:25:45,160
But

1497
02:25:45,160 --> 02:25:47,160
he doesn't?

1498
02:25:47,160 --> 02:25:49,160
He seems kind of

1499
02:25:49,160 --> 02:25:51,160
kind of

1500
02:25:51,160 --> 02:25:53,160
reclusive.

1501
02:25:55,160 --> 02:25:57,160
Which is weird

1502
02:25:57,160 --> 02:25:59,160
for a guy who supposedly

1503
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:01,160
travels for it.

1504
02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:03,160
Maybe it's just around people.

1505
02:26:05,160 --> 02:26:07,160
Let me by.

1506
02:26:07,160 --> 02:26:09,160
Let me in.

1507
02:26:09,160 --> 02:26:11,160
Computer, it's currently all.

1508
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:15,160
Let's over here.

1509
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:17,160
Robot.

1510
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:19,160
Oh, person.

1511
02:26:19,160 --> 02:26:21,160
Hi.

1512
02:26:21,160 --> 02:26:23,160
Reselving in progress.

1513
02:26:23,160 --> 02:26:25,160
Please watch out

1514
02:26:25,160 --> 02:26:27,160
for potential

1515
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:29,160
following books.

1516
02:26:29,160 --> 02:26:31,160
I will.

1517
02:26:31,160 --> 02:26:33,160
Still scared of ladders.

1518
02:26:45,160 --> 02:26:47,160
Oh.

1519
02:26:55,160 --> 02:26:57,160
You know what I forgot to do today?

1520
02:26:57,160 --> 02:26:59,160
Before stream.

1521
02:27:01,160 --> 02:27:03,160
It was something I forgot to do today.

1522
02:27:07,160 --> 02:27:09,160
I forgot.

1523
02:27:09,160 --> 02:27:11,160
I completely forgot.

1524
02:27:11,160 --> 02:27:13,160
I forgot to say on twitter

1525
02:27:13,160 --> 02:27:15,160
that I was live.

1526
02:27:23,160 --> 02:27:25,160
Oops.

1527
02:27:25,160 --> 02:27:27,160
I react.

1528
02:27:37,160 --> 02:27:39,160
Butter late than ever.

1529
02:27:39,160 --> 02:27:41,160
Yeah, let's do that right now.

1530
02:27:43,160 --> 02:27:45,160
We'll be live for a little while.

1531
02:27:59,160 --> 02:28:01,160
It's almost hibernation time.

1532
02:28:03,160 --> 02:28:05,160
One day I'm going to sleep

1533
02:28:05,160 --> 02:28:07,160
for like 13 hours.

1534
02:28:07,160 --> 02:28:09,160
So.

1535
02:28:09,160 --> 02:28:11,160
Ready for it.

1536
02:28:13,160 --> 02:28:15,160
Oh.

1537
02:28:15,160 --> 02:28:17,160
Ow.

1538
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:19,160
I hit my head.

1539
02:28:19,160 --> 02:28:21,160

You're going through these pages pretty fast.

1641
02:36:55,460 --> 02:36:58,460
Also known as seed shrimp.

1642
02:36:58,460 --> 02:37:04,460
And certain vernaculars due to the shape of their transparent coat.

1643
02:37:04,460 --> 02:37:10,460
These aquatic invertebrates are the most abundant life form

1644
02:37:10,460 --> 02:37:13,460
in the oceans surrounding the barrens.

1645
02:37:14,460 --> 02:37:19,460

1647

sometimes captured and messed and put in jars

1648
02:37:28,460 --> 02:37:33,460
to be used as living lamps by the Glen's residents.

1649
02:37:33,460 --> 02:37:37,460
This has inspired the now common practice

1650
02:37:37,460 --> 02:37:42,460
of using phosphor shrimps to do the same.

1651
02:37:42,460 --> 02:37:48,460
That made me light-headed.

1652
02:38:13,460 --> 02:38:18,460

02:38:18,460 --> 02:38:23,460

1657
02:38:37,460 --> 02:38:41,460

1658
02:38:41,460 --> 02:38:43,460

1661
02:39:03,460 --> 02:39:05,460
Book reading is smart.

1662
02:39:05,460 --> 02:39:09,460
Using that voice really kind of...

1663
02:39:09,460 --> 02:39:12,460
It's because I can't take breaths in between,

1664
02:39:12,460 --> 02:39:15,460
like proper breaths.

1665
02:39:15,460 --> 02:39:18,460
And my lungs aren't so great.

1666
02:39:21,460 --> 02:39:25,460
So when I read in that voice,

1667
02:39:25,460 --> 02:39:28,460
it's hard to take a breath.

1668
02:39:28,460 --> 02:39:33,460

1669
02:39:34,460 --> 02:39:39,460

As a general rule, if a phosphorous loses its glow entirely, it cannot be re-lit unless exposed to the sun.

1733
02:43:46,580 --> 02:43:56,580
If the phosphor is merely dim, it may be possible to boost it through exposure through another phosphor of higher energy.

1734
02:43:59,580 --> 02:44:06,580
But even so, the boosted phosphor will never return to its original brightness.

Chapter 5. A survey of phosphors found in the natural world.

1736

Chapter 6. Blue Phosphor Location

1737
02:44:29,580 --> 02:44:47,580
Blue Phosphor is of moderate levels of energy. It can exist in both organic and mineral forms.

1738
02:44:48,580 --> 02:44:55,580
A mineral form is most commonly found in the metallic sound of the parents.

1739
02:44:56,580 --> 02:45:05,580
The organic form is most commonly found in phosphor strength and in secretions.

1740
02:45:06,580 --> 02:45:20,580
Although the light emission of blue phosphor is powerful, it has what I would describe as self-conserving properties.

1741
02:45:20,580 --> 02:45:35,580
That is to say, the glow may not be constant. Most forms of blue phosphor will stop glowing if left undisturbed for long periods of time.

1742
02:45:35,580 --> 02:45:54,580
If using blue phosphor to perform machines, a motor should be set at a baseline level of activity to ensure constant agitation of the phosphor. Alternatively, live phosphors from can be used.

1743
02:45:55,580 --> 02:46:02,580
Chapter 7. Green Phosphor Location

1744
02:46:02,580 --> 02:46:18,580
Green Phosphor is one of the highest energy. It is almost the rarest of the common phosphor as it can only be found in organic form.

1745
02:46:18,580 --> 02:46:27,580
The known sources include the sap of phosphor trees, fireflies, and various mosses.

1746
02:46:27,580 --> 02:46:52,580
Although this phosphor is present in a... uh oh, what word is that? Apoquitas grounds covering moss in the glen. It is only a minute or months and almost impossible to concentrate.

1747
02:46:52,580 --> 02:47:06,580
Green Phosphor is ideal or industrial use, however, due to its relative scarcity and past over-arvesting.

1748
02:47:06,580 --> 02:47:18,580
And there is currently no reliable source. Thankfully, at least locals of the glen still have enough to get by.

1749
02:47:19,580 --> 02:47:21,580
Ubiquitas.

1750
02:47:22,580 --> 02:47:24,580
Ubiquitas?

1751
02:47:25,580 --> 02:47:28,580
What a strange word. Ubiquitas.

1752
02:47:31,580 --> 02:47:35,580
English is silly. And there it is.

There's nothing you can do this time.

1772
02:50:25,220 --> 02:50:32,220
Out of the common phosphorus, red phosphorus is the lowest energy.

1773
02:50:32,220 --> 02:50:43,220
It exists exclusively in mineral form and can only give light when in solution.

1774
02:50:43,220 --> 02:51:03,220
There's nothing you can do this time.

1775
02:51:03,220 --> 02:51:12,220

There's nothing you can do this time.

1778
02:51:33,220 --> 02:51:46,220
I'll take my meds in 30 minutes.

1779
02:51:46,220 --> 02:51:51,220
If I take it now, pull me to sleep.

1780
02:51:51,220 --> 02:52:00,220
I'm swimming.

1781
02:52:00,220 --> 02:52:05,220
Don't do this to me.

1782
02:52:05,220 --> 02:52:09,220
30 minutes, I promise.

1783
02:52:09,220 --> 02:52:22,220
Believe me.

1784
02:52:22,220 --> 02:52:28,220
I sleep like a pterodactyl.

1785
02:52:29,220 --> 02:52:45,220
I sleep like a pterodactyl.

1786
02:52:45,220 --> 02:53:05,220
I'll take my meds.

1787
02:53:05,220 --> 02:53:14,220
I'll take them.

1788
02:53:15,220 --> 02:53:22,220
I just ripped the scab off my hand.

1789
02:53:22,220 --> 02:53:30,220
The scab from the bike incident.

1790
02:53:30,220 --> 02:53:42,220
I was finally feeling.

1791
02:53:42,220 --> 02:53:53,220
Don't come, baby.

1792
02:53:53,220 --> 02:54:01,220
I make that noise when I fly to scare people sometimes.

1793
02:54:01,220 --> 02:54:12,220
Maybe fly around.

1794
02:54:12,220 --> 02:54:16,220
And also grow massive and still fly around.

1795
02:54:16,220 --> 02:54:26,220
Just a giant figure in the sky.

1796
02:54:31,220 --> 02:54:47,220
Just get really big.

1797
02:54:47,220 --> 02:55:16,220
Oh, no.

1798
02:55:17,220 --> 02:55:37,220
Oh, no.

1799
02:55:38,220 --> 02:55:45,220
It's just closed out.

1800
02:55:45,220 --> 02:55:54,220
Where did I stop reading?

1801
02:55:54,220 --> 02:56:01,220
This can create an artificial light energy stage with great luminosity.

1802
02:56:01,220 --> 02:56:17,220
The major caveat is that the phosphor is the super saturated solution will precipitate out rather quickly.

1803
02:56:17,220 --> 02:56:28,220
As soon as the phosphor recrystallizes, it loses its glow permanently.

1804
02:56:28,220 --> 02:56:48,220
If using super saturated red phosphor as a power source, make sure there are proper facilities or services that can replace it frequently.

1805
02:56:49,220 --> 02:56:55,220
I yield the author is so cool.

1806
02:56:55,220 --> 02:57:02,220
I already can travel over the world with a flying machine as I gather materials for his books.

1807
02:57:02,220 --> 02:57:04,220
Wow.

1808
02:57:04,220 --> 02:57:09,220
You know, I've tried looking for the flying machine with my binoculars for ages.

1809
02:57:09,220 --> 02:57:15,220
I was so such a thing, though.

1810
02:57:16,220 --> 02:57:20,220
What are you doing to that book?

1811
02:57:20,220 --> 02:57:24,220
Don't worry. These are my own books that I wrote.

1812
02:57:24,220 --> 02:57:28,220
I just pulled them off the shelves to modify them.

1813
02:57:28,220 --> 02:57:31,220
I have to cross out some sections.

1814
02:57:31,220 --> 02:57:33,220
Most sections.

1815
02:57:33,220 --> 02:57:35,220
I don't know how come.

1816
02:57:35,220 --> 02:57:38,220
Because otherwise they'll think I copied him.

1817
02:57:38,220 --> 02:57:41,220
Him the other.

1818
02:57:41,220 --> 02:57:45,220
Man, I really don't see the point of writing anything anymore.

1819
02:57:45,220 --> 02:57:49,220
The author is just gonna write about the same thing.

1820
02:57:49,220 --> 02:57:51,220
Then everyone will love it.

1821
02:57:51,220 --> 02:57:55,220
I know he's gonna remember the books that I came out before it is.

1822
02:57:55,220 --> 02:57:57,220
Oh, man.

1823
02:57:57,220 --> 02:57:59,220
I ain't hatin'.

1824
02:57:59,220 --> 02:58:01,220
I ain't hatin'.

1825
02:58:01,220 --> 02:58:05,220
I ain't hatin'.

1826
02:58:05,220 --> 02:58:08,220
I ain't hatin'.

1827
02:58:08,220 --> 02:58:11,220
I can see why people go nuts with this stuff.

1828
02:58:11,220 --> 02:58:14,220
That guy's got major talent.

1829
02:58:14,220 --> 02:58:18,220
This just hurts, you know?

1830
02:58:18,220 --> 02:58:20,220
I've had that before.

1831
02:58:20,220 --> 02:58:24,220
I used to draw stuff.

1832
02:58:24,220 --> 02:58:30,220
And I would draw like poses and stuff.

1833
02:58:30,220 --> 02:58:33,220
People would be like, you're just using that pose.

1834
02:58:33,220 --> 02:58:35,220
Someone else used that pose.

1835
02:58:35,220 --> 02:58:38,220
I'm just using this pose.

1836
02:58:38,220 --> 02:58:41,220
Oh.

1837
02:58:41,220 --> 02:58:44,220
Oh.

1838
02:58:44,220 --> 02:58:53,220
It's not a problem if people call you a copycat for something you wrote about first.

1839
02:58:53,220 --> 02:58:55,220
I can see that.

1840
02:58:55,220 --> 02:59:00,220
People call me a cat all the time.

1841
02:59:00,220 --> 02:59:02,220
Have me go.

1842
02:59:02,220 --> 02:59:04,220
Why is he so cute?

1843
02:59:04,220 --> 02:59:06,220
I don't know.

1844
02:59:06,220 --> 02:59:10,220
I don't want to be this cute.

1845
02:59:15,220 --> 02:59:18,220
It's a crime.

1846
02:59:18,220 --> 02:59:24,220
Even though I'm a person and cats are pets and mousebers.

1847
02:59:24,220 --> 02:59:31,220
I sure, I sure, I sure hope people don't think I eat mice.

1848
02:59:31,220 --> 02:59:35,220
I guess we're in the same boat, kiddo.

1849
02:59:35,220 --> 02:59:39,220
I think I changed at least half of books worth of content.

1850
02:59:39,220 --> 02:59:42,220
Even then, it's still too similar.

1851
02:59:42,220 --> 02:59:44,220
Looks like I'll just have to accept my fate.

1852
02:59:44,220 --> 02:59:48,220
But I guess being called a cat isn't all that bad.

1853
02:59:48,220 --> 02:59:52,220
As long as people don't assume you eat mice.

1854
02:59:54,220 --> 02:59:56,220
I'm done.

1855
02:59:56,220 --> 02:59:59,220
I'm done.

1856
02:59:59,220 --> 03:00:01,220
Excuse me.

1857
03:00:01,220 --> 03:00:04,220
Oh, you are the messiah.

1858
03:00:04,220 --> 03:00:06,220
Welcome.

1859
03:00:06,220 --> 03:00:09,220
I have to take this bracelet off the sternart.

1860
03:00:09,220 --> 03:00:11,220
Annoy me.

1861
03:00:11,220 --> 03:00:13,220
Get off me, get off me!

1862
03:00:13,220 --> 03:00:16,220
We're good.

1863
03:00:16,220 --> 03:00:19,220
We're fine.

1864
03:00:19,220 --> 03:00:21,220

03:01:40,520 --> 03:02:10,520
ítulo 5  crucifix

1874
03:02:10,520 --> 03:02:16,520
She is here. She is in the archival room upstairs.

1875
03:02:16,520 --> 03:02:24,520
When she is concentrating on her work, she will ignore any and all phone call for several days.

1876
03:02:24,520 --> 03:02:30,520
Nice. Can you go get her in person then? Leaving this post is not in my programming.

1877
03:02:30,520 --> 03:02:36,520
And can I go myself? Of course. The archival room is accessible through the stairway behind me.

1878
03:02:37,520 --> 03:02:38,520
Gosh, I think.

1879
03:02:43,520 --> 03:02:45,520
Hello, very interesting archival room.

1880
03:02:48,520 --> 03:02:51,520
Coffee. Coffee is for grown-ups.

1881
03:02:52,520 --> 03:02:54,520
You know, Miko, you said you were a grown-up.

1882
03:02:55,520 --> 03:02:59,520
On authorised entry. Library card required for further access. Wait, what?

1883
03:03:00,520 --> 03:03:02,520
Library card required for further access.

1884
03:03:02,520 --> 03:03:04,520
No library card though. We're gonna get one.

1885
03:03:04,520 --> 03:03:07,520
This is a question for the headlamp.

1886
03:03:17,520 --> 03:03:18,520
Tell me to call her.

1887
03:03:29,520 --> 03:03:31,520
Are you heading to bed? Good night.

1888
03:03:32,520 --> 03:03:33,520
Have a good night.

1889
03:03:34,520 --> 03:03:35,520
Good night.

1890
03:03:40,520 --> 03:03:43,520
Thank you for stopping by the day's stream.

1891
03:03:54,520 --> 03:03:55,520
She is not picking up.

1892
03:03:56,520 --> 03:03:57,520
I figured.

1893
03:03:58,520 --> 03:04:00,520
Are you sure you can't just let me through?

1894
03:04:00,520 --> 03:04:03,520
Letting you through with that library card is against my programming.

1895
03:04:03,520 --> 03:04:04,520
What?

1896
03:04:05,520 --> 03:04:08,520
Even in an emergency, my program is not flexible.

1897
03:04:09,520 --> 03:04:10,520
I have not been tamed.

1898
03:04:18,520 --> 03:04:19,520
What if I just run?

1899
03:04:21,520 --> 03:04:23,520
What if I just run in with stopping me?

1900
03:04:24,520 --> 03:04:26,520
What's he gonna do, blow me up?

1901
03:04:27,520 --> 03:04:31,520
I thought the rules was not to hurt humans or any living creature.

1902
03:04:33,520 --> 03:04:35,520
I'm on my third cup of coffee.

1903
03:04:36,520 --> 03:04:38,520
I can't feel my limbs and stop drinking.

1904
03:04:39,520 --> 03:04:42,520
When I have to stay awake, I need to find out how this book ends.

1905
03:04:42,520 --> 03:04:44,520
You can read it the next day.

1906
03:04:45,520 --> 03:04:47,520
Wait, but the world is kind of ending.

1907
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:51,520
Wanting to finish your book before it does.

1908
03:04:52,520 --> 03:04:53,520
Relatable.

1909
03:04:53,520 --> 03:04:54,520
Relatable?

1910
03:04:55,520 --> 03:04:57,520
Because the author and his beautiful clipping hurts.

1911
03:05:00,520 --> 03:05:02,520
I got a library card.

1912
03:05:08,520 --> 03:05:10,520
A library card.

1913
03:05:15,520 --> 03:05:16,520
He just played at me.

1914
03:05:17,520 --> 03:05:18,520
I don't think we should bother him.

1915
03:05:19,520 --> 03:05:20,520
What a jerk.

1916
03:05:21,520 --> 03:05:23,520
What a stinky poo poo head.

1917
03:05:24,520 --> 03:05:25,520
What a stinker.

1918
03:05:26,520 --> 03:05:27,520
Smells like kaka.

1919
03:05:32,520 --> 03:05:33,520
Street up.

1920
03:05:34,520 --> 03:05:35,520
Poopoo.

1921
03:05:36,520 --> 03:05:37,520
Love person.

1922
03:05:37,520 --> 03:05:38,520
Libraries up ahead, thanks.

1923
03:05:43,520 --> 03:05:46,520
Okay, that promises the least pain on your grave.

1924
03:05:46,520 --> 03:05:47,520
I do.

1925
03:05:50,520 --> 03:05:51,520
Um...

1926
03:06:04,520 --> 03:06:06,520
Oh, excuse me.

1927
03:06:08,520 --> 03:06:11,520
Wait, did I come from that way?

1928
03:06:21,520 --> 03:06:24,520
It's an elevator.

1929
03:06:26,520 --> 03:06:28,520
We have been here before.

1930
03:06:40,520 --> 03:06:42,520
Fish tank. It's a big fish tank.

1931
03:06:42,520 --> 03:06:43,520
Oh, hey there.

1932
03:06:44,520 --> 03:06:45,520
You have a lot of fish.

1933
03:06:45,520 --> 03:06:47,520
Yeah, I'm worried about them.

1934
03:06:47,520 --> 03:06:48,520
Huh?

1935
03:06:48,520 --> 03:06:54,520
Or something about how the square particle stuff just took out a major pipeline.

1936
03:06:54,520 --> 03:06:58,520
I guess I should take advantage of the running water while I still can.

1937
03:07:01,520 --> 03:07:02,520
The sink.

1938
03:07:04,520 --> 03:07:05,520
Big fish.

1939
03:07:05,520 --> 03:07:06,520
Nope.

1940
03:07:06,520 --> 03:07:08,520
Not looking for it's that water shortage.

1941
03:07:12,520 --> 03:07:14,520
Is there anything I can do in here?

1942
03:07:35,520 --> 03:07:36,520
Does he want this?

1943
03:07:38,520 --> 03:07:39,520
No?

1944
03:07:39,520 --> 03:07:40,520
No.

1945
03:07:45,520 --> 03:07:46,520
Anything else?

1946
03:07:46,520 --> 03:07:48,520
Anything else?

1947
03:07:48,520 --> 03:07:50,520
Are you here to purchase a copy?

1948
03:07:50,520 --> 03:07:51,520
No?

1949
03:07:51,520 --> 03:07:52,520
Favorite for grown-ups?

1950
03:07:52,520 --> 03:07:53,520
Grown-ups?

1951
03:07:53,520 --> 03:07:54,520
Yeah.

1952
03:07:54,520 --> 03:07:55,520
What does that mean?

1953
03:07:55,520 --> 03:07:56,520
I don't know.

1954
03:07:56,520 --> 03:07:57,520

1961

Grown-ups?

1962
03:08:04,520 --> 03:08:05,520
Yeah.

1963
03:08:05,520 --> 03:08:06,520
What does that mean?

1964
03:08:06,520 --> 03:08:07,520
It means people who aren't kids.

1965
03:08:07,520 --> 03:08:08,520
Kids?

1966
03:08:08,520 --> 03:08:10,520
Or aren't you a kid?

1967
03:08:10,520 --> 03:08:11,520
I'm a robot.

1968
03:08:11,520 --> 03:08:12,520

2107

It suddenly appeared. It was missing for like a whole two weeks. Now it's right in front of me.

2108
03:24:01,800 --> 03:24:04,800
I can't find it. I have it.

2109
03:24:07,800 --> 03:24:09,800
Oh shh.

2110
03:24:14,800 --> 03:24:16,800
I did not feel good.

2111
03:24:20,800 --> 03:24:23,800
Burned.

2112
03:24:51,800 --> 03:24:53,800
Alright.

2113
03:24:54,800 --> 03:25:01,800
All my vets have been taken. I even put my cream on. I did all of that.

2114
03:25:11,800 --> 03:25:13,800
And I'm gonna light this candle.

2115
03:25:21,800 --> 03:25:23,800
Can you help me?

2116
03:25:24,800 --> 03:25:26,800
Here you go.

2117
03:25:27,800 --> 03:25:29,800
Oh, that was hot.

2118
03:25:29,800 --> 03:25:31,800
I'm working here.

2119
03:25:57,800 --> 03:25:59,800
How about my schedule?

2120
03:26:17,800 --> 03:26:20,800
That was a thought that was in my head and I said it all out.

2121
03:26:21,800 --> 03:26:28,800
I wonder what the author would do in this situation.

2122
03:26:28,800 --> 03:26:32,800
I thought this little blank usually references his work.

2123
03:26:37,800 --> 03:26:39,800
There's work here.

2124
03:26:40,800 --> 03:26:45,800
The barrens in there just reported another sighting of the particles.

2125
03:26:45,800 --> 03:26:51,800
The particles are commonly not here unusual at this point.

2126
03:26:54,800 --> 03:26:57,800
Those squares particles just took it out.

2127
03:26:57,800 --> 03:26:59,800
I don't know about that one.

2128
03:27:00,800 --> 03:27:03,800
I might have to put on water and it was...

2129
03:27:03,800 --> 03:27:05,800
...adaptable.

2130
03:27:07,800 --> 03:27:09,800
Alright.

2131
03:27:15,800 --> 03:27:19,800
And we have some more disruptions.

2132
03:27:19,800 --> 03:27:23,800
And Sector 8 of the city.

2133
03:27:24,800 --> 03:27:30,800
This is consistent with our earlier findings. Not good at all.

2134
03:27:39,800 --> 03:27:42,800
I can barely keep my eyes open.

2135
03:27:42,800 --> 03:27:44,800
Help me too.

2136
03:27:44,800 --> 03:27:50,800
How does a doctor's silver blank get that all out energy?

2137
03:27:53,800 --> 03:27:57,800
These are of a thermal functioning at a frightening rate.

2138
03:27:57,800 --> 03:28:04,800
The school damage from square particle anomalies is almost impossible to reverse.

2139
03:28:04,800 --> 03:28:08,800
Not a living person can touch them unless they have a death wish.

2140
03:28:08,800 --> 03:28:13,800
But if we're lucky, sometimes the squares go away on their own.

2141
03:28:13,800 --> 03:28:20,800
But not before taking away one of the robot's arms or legs or head.

2142
03:28:21,800 --> 03:28:23,800
Okay.

2143
03:28:25,800 --> 03:28:27,800
I cannot stop spinning.

2144
03:28:28,800 --> 03:28:30,800
Robot.

2145
03:28:31,800 --> 03:28:33,800
You're waiting to be repaired.

2146
03:28:34,800 --> 03:28:36,800
You're waiting to be repaired.

2147
03:28:37,800 --> 03:28:39,800
This one is an active.

2148
03:28:40,800 --> 03:28:43,800
This is so tedious.

2149
03:28:43,800 --> 03:28:50,800
I miss the good old days before our robot repairing robots broke down.

2150
03:28:50,800 --> 03:28:54,800
All robots have to be assembled by actual people.

2151
03:28:54,800 --> 03:28:57,800
But aren't you a robot?

2152
03:28:57,800 --> 03:28:59,800
No?

2153
03:28:59,800 --> 03:29:01,800
Do I sound like a robot to you?

2154
03:29:01,800 --> 03:29:02,800
Or really?

2155
03:29:02,800 --> 03:29:04,800
Your head is a TV.

2156
03:29:04,800 --> 03:29:07,800
What does that have to do with anything?

2157
03:29:07,800 --> 03:29:09,800
Nevermind.

2158
03:29:10,800 --> 03:29:12,800
Robot.

2159
03:29:19,800 --> 03:29:22,800
A lot of us have been sleeping.

2160
03:29:22,800 --> 03:29:27,800
Sleeping very well in light of recent events.

2161
03:29:27,800 --> 03:29:31,800
And the square particle stuck out a few of my robots, I think.

2162
03:29:32,800 --> 03:29:34,800
She's still asleep.

2163
03:29:35,800 --> 03:29:37,800
She's still asleep.

2164
03:29:43,800 --> 03:29:44,800
That's me.

2165
03:29:44,800 --> 03:29:48,800
Ah, so I thought I'd sleep some time.

2166
03:29:49,800 --> 03:29:51,800
Hello?

2167
03:29:52,800 --> 03:29:54,800
Oh, shoot.

2168
03:29:54,800 --> 03:29:56,800
But I know you would be here so soon.

2169
03:29:56,800 --> 03:29:59,800
I would've turned off the darn wall.

2170
03:30:00,800 --> 03:30:02,800
Hello there.

2171
03:30:02,800 --> 03:30:04,800
What about the weird security measures?

2172
03:30:04,800 --> 03:30:05,800
Oh, yeah.

2173
03:30:05,800 --> 03:30:07,800
They're holding something.

2174
03:30:07,800 --> 03:30:08,800
I don't know.

2175
03:30:08,800 --> 03:30:10,800
Can I help you with anything?

2176
03:30:10,800 --> 03:30:11,800
Yeah.

2177
03:30:11,800 --> 03:30:13,800
Do you know how you get a library card?

2178
03:30:13,800 --> 03:30:14,800
A library card?

2179
03:30:14,800 --> 03:30:17,800
No, there's a library for that to try.

2180
03:30:17,800 --> 03:30:20,800
I need it to see the library.

2181
03:30:20,800 --> 03:30:22,800
But I can't get through the library card.

2182
03:30:22,800 --> 03:30:25,800
But at the same time, she's the one who gives out library cards.

2183
03:30:25,800 --> 03:30:26,800
Really.

2184
03:30:27,800 --> 03:30:28,800
Yeah.

2185
03:30:29,800 --> 03:30:31,800
I'm just going.

2186
03:30:32,800 --> 03:30:34,800
Please get some Eve for me.

2187
03:30:34,800 --> 03:30:36,800
Okay, I'm okay.

2188
03:30:40,800 --> 03:30:42,800
I'll go to sleep soon, alright?

2189
03:30:42,800 --> 03:30:43,800
I'm fine.

2190
03:30:44,800 --> 03:30:47,800
We're almost done with the game, I think, right?

2191
03:30:47,800 --> 03:30:50,800
How much longer do you think we have?

2192
03:30:51,800 --> 03:30:54,800
How much more do we have?

2193
03:30:55,800 --> 03:30:57,800
I want to keep going.

2194
03:30:57,800 --> 03:30:59,800
If we're so close, let's finish it.

2195
03:30:59,800 --> 03:31:01,800
We could finish it.

2196
03:31:03,800 --> 03:31:05,800
It will finish this.

2197
03:31:05,800 --> 03:31:06,800
I'm fine.

2198
03:31:08,800 --> 03:31:10,800
That sounds like JoJo already.

2199
03:31:10,800 --> 03:31:13,800
I'm sorry you can't hear all that fuzzy.

2200
03:31:14,800 --> 03:31:15,800
Wait, I don't know.

2201
03:31:15,800 --> 03:31:17,800
I need to see the library card.

2202
03:31:17,800 --> 03:31:19,800
It won't be hard for me to get on.

2203
03:31:19,800 --> 03:31:20,800
Okay.

2204
03:31:21,800 --> 03:31:22,800
There.

2205
03:31:22,800 --> 03:31:24,800
You're also, I think.

2206
03:31:24,800 --> 03:31:25,800
Wait.

2207
03:31:25,800 --> 03:31:26,800
Shoot.

2208
03:31:26,800 --> 03:31:27,800
I forgot.

2209
03:31:27,800 --> 03:31:30,800
If I'm just a library bot.

2210
03:31:30,800 --> 03:31:32,800
I have a face recognition function.

2211
03:31:32,800 --> 03:31:33,800
My photo.

2212
03:31:33,800 --> 03:31:35,800
The card won't match you.

2213
03:31:36,800 --> 03:31:38,800
How much do I have to have a photo?

2214
03:31:38,800 --> 03:31:39,800
Keep a photo.

2215
03:31:40,800 --> 03:31:42,800
My face to your face.

2216
03:31:42,800 --> 03:31:44,800
That was a joke.

2217
03:31:45,800 --> 03:31:48,800
No, no, maybe you'll get lucky enough about the video.

2218
03:31:49,800 --> 03:31:51,800
First comes first.

2219
03:31:51,800 --> 03:31:54,800
I always find stories in the photo.

2220
03:31:55,800 --> 03:31:56,800
What's this?

2221
03:31:56,800 --> 03:31:58,800
I'm always looking out for stuff.

2222
03:31:58,800 --> 03:31:59,800
The shit with glittering glue.

2223
03:31:59,800 --> 03:32:01,800
You know how that feels.

2224
03:32:01,800 --> 03:32:03,800
I don't know any glitter.

2225
03:32:03,800 --> 03:32:04,800
You sure?

2226
03:32:04,800 --> 03:32:05,800
Yeah.

2227
03:32:05,800 --> 03:32:07,800
How much on do those?

2228
03:32:07,800 --> 03:32:09,800
I'll throw us during your hair.

2229
03:32:09,800 --> 03:32:11,800
I know I do a little bit.

2230
03:32:15,800 --> 03:32:18,800
I've been walking all over the world.

2231
03:32:18,800 --> 03:32:19,800
Yeah.

2232
03:32:19,800 --> 03:32:20,800
Imagine.

2233
03:32:21,800 --> 03:32:23,800
Do you get really tired sometimes?

2234
03:32:23,800 --> 03:32:24,800
Yeah.

2235
03:32:24,800 --> 03:32:25,800
Yeah.

2236
03:32:26,800 --> 03:32:27,800
Yeah, kind of.

2237
03:32:27,800 --> 03:32:28,800
Yeah.

2238
03:32:29,800 --> 03:32:30,800
Yeah.

2239
03:32:31,800 --> 03:32:32,800
But I don't mind.

2240
03:32:32,800 --> 03:32:34,800
It's actually really pretty.

2241
03:32:34,800 --> 03:32:36,800
Yeah, this game is really great.

2242
03:32:38,800 --> 03:32:40,800
I'm glad that you think so.

2243
03:32:41,800 --> 03:32:43,800
Even when the sun's gone.

2244
03:32:43,800 --> 03:32:45,800
But it's still a beautiful place.

2245
03:32:46,800 --> 03:32:49,800
What does the world look like with the sun?

2246
03:32:49,800 --> 03:32:50,800
Oh.

2247
03:32:50,800 --> 03:32:51,800
Uh.

2248
03:32:51,800 --> 03:32:52,800
You know.

2249
03:32:52,800 --> 03:32:54,800
Some of the birds that I've met.

2250
03:32:54,800 --> 03:32:56,800
A little of us have actually seen it.

2251
03:32:56,800 --> 03:32:57,800
Oh.

2252
03:32:57,800 --> 03:32:59,800
Ironic, isn't it?

2253
03:32:59,800 --> 03:33:02,800
It was on the world's leading researcher.

2254
03:33:02,800 --> 03:33:05,800
While I just stay here and build robots.

2255
03:33:06,800 --> 03:33:08,800
They're the ones exploring the world.

2256
03:33:08,800 --> 03:33:10,800
I just write down the data.

2257
03:33:10,800 --> 03:33:11,800
Crunch numbers.

2258
03:33:11,800 --> 03:33:12,800
Generate graphs.

2259
03:33:12,800 --> 03:33:13,800
Right.

2260
03:33:14,800 --> 03:33:16,800
I've been seeing robots everywhere.

2261
03:33:16,800 --> 03:33:20,800
I thought it was because the world was too dangerous for most people to explore.

2262
03:33:20,800 --> 03:33:23,800
That's not far from the truth, actually.

2263
03:33:23,800 --> 03:33:25,800
But I know someone.

2264
03:33:25,800 --> 03:33:27,800
Still does this research for a second.

2265
03:33:27,800 --> 03:33:28,800
Oh.

2266
03:33:29,800 --> 03:33:32,800
Even after segments.

2267
03:33:32,800 --> 03:33:35,800
The land started collapsing and access.

2268
03:33:35,800 --> 03:33:37,800
But the more remote.

2269
03:33:38,800 --> 03:33:39,800
Uh.

2270
03:33:39,800 --> 03:33:40,800
There's a stretch.

2271
03:33:40,800 --> 03:33:41,800
You got it.

2272
03:33:41,800 --> 03:33:42,800
Here it is.

2273
03:33:42,800 --> 03:33:44,800
It became difficult.

2274
03:34:06,800 --> 03:34:08,800
We can finish an hour.

2275
03:34:08,800 --> 03:34:09,800
That's fine.

2276
03:34:09,800 --> 03:34:11,800
Let's finish this.

2277
03:34:12,800 --> 03:34:14,800
Because tomorrow we play stray.

2278
03:34:14,800 --> 03:34:16,800
And we get to be a cat.

2279
03:34:18,800 --> 03:34:20,800
Cat games.

2280
03:34:20,800 --> 03:34:22,800
The best kind of games.

2281
03:34:27,800 --> 03:34:29,800
Our game is calling you out.

2282
03:34:29,800 --> 03:34:30,800
It's true.

2283
03:34:30,800 --> 03:34:31,800
Drink water.

2284
03:34:31,800 --> 03:34:33,800
I've been drinking soda.

2285
03:34:33,800 --> 03:34:35,800
I haven't been drinking water.

2286
03:34:36,800 --> 03:34:39,800
I drunk all you an entire thing of orange juice today.

2287
03:34:42,800 --> 03:34:43,800
Oh.

2288
03:34:52,800 --> 03:34:54,800
Tomorrow's collab.

2289
03:34:54,800 --> 03:34:55,800
I forgot.

2290
03:34:55,800 --> 03:34:56,800
Okay.

2291
03:34:56,800 --> 03:34:57,800
I forgot.

2292
03:34:57,800 --> 03:34:58,800
I forgot.

2293
03:34:58,800 --> 03:34:59,800
I forgot.

2294
03:34:59,800 --> 03:35:01,800
Tomorrow we have a group collab with the adults.

2295
03:35:03,800 --> 03:35:05,800
There are some of the adults girls.

2296
03:35:12,800 --> 03:35:13,800
Yeah.

2297
03:35:25,800 --> 03:35:26,800
I'll watch them.

2298
03:35:26,800 --> 03:35:27,800
I'm 40.

2299
03:35:27,800 --> 03:35:29,800
Turn it over with the voices.

2300
03:35:30,800 --> 03:35:32,800
You don't have all of our streams of them.

2301
03:35:34,800 --> 03:35:36,800
Fun.

2302
03:35:36,800 --> 03:35:37,800
Yeah.

2303
03:35:37,800 --> 03:35:39,800

03:48:59,360 --> 03:49:02,960

03:59:42,740 --> 03:59:44,540
can you tell me what i need to do next?

2537
03:59:45,040 --> 03:59:47,200
i am not supposed to go to the Tower

2538
03:59:47,700 --> 03:59:49,880
do you know how I get in?

2539
03:59:49,940 --> 03:59:51,920
given? Nope

2540
03:59:52,620 --> 03:59:56,020
oh- i don't think anyone is supposed to get inside the tower

2541
03:59:59,480 --> 04:00:02,100
why is it so far away?

2542
04:00:02,100 --> 04:00:32,100
ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ�

2543
04:00:32,100 --> 04:00:34,100
Wow

2544
04:00:51,100 --> 04:00:58,100
In my experience, the kind of knowledge is usually recorded in some cryptic book.

2545
04:00:58,100 --> 04:01:04,100
But I haven't read anything like that before. Sorry.

2546
04:01:04,100 --> 04:01:10,100
I have a cryptic book.

2547
04:01:10,100 --> 04:01:16,100
These books are full of cool speakers.

2548
04:01:16,100 --> 04:01:22,100
Those are my manuscripts that others sent me as a head librarian.

2549
04:01:22,100 --> 04:01:28,100
It's my job to help them with the publication process.

2550
04:01:28,100 --> 04:01:34,100
But it really hasn't been sending me anything.

2551
04:01:34,100 --> 04:01:38,100
This is an icon.

2552
04:01:38,100 --> 04:01:44,100
I guess it does give me some extra time to work through this backlog.

2553
04:01:44,100 --> 04:01:48,100
To be honest, I'm a little behind.

2554
04:01:48,100 --> 04:01:52,100
Here is another one.

2555
04:01:52,100 --> 04:01:56,100
This is an crossing book.

2556
04:01:56,100 --> 04:02:02,100
He stopped sending me many things with a pile of Korean semicircles the other day.

2557
04:02:02,100 --> 04:02:16,060
This is where

2558

2567
04:05:46,060 --> 04:05:50,060
I will never recognize the objects, at least.

2568
04:05:53,060 --> 04:05:58,060
9, 10, 45, 23, Thursday.

2569
04:05:58,060 --> 04:06:01,060
Very sketchy practice.

2570
04:06:05,060 --> 04:06:07,060
What the fuck happened?

2571
04:06:07,060 --> 04:06:09,060
Hey, I need this book.

2572
04:06:09,060 --> 04:06:11,060
It's actually a book lover.

2573
04:06:12,060 --> 04:06:15,060
Although this documentation

2574
04:06:15,060 --> 04:06:18,060
is primarily backed with black,

2575
04:06:18,060 --> 04:06:21,060
the leaves display incredible resistance

2576
04:06:21,060 --> 04:06:24,060
and exposes just in light.

2577
04:06:24,060 --> 04:06:28,060
These curious lands are more resilient, resilient,

2578
04:06:28,060 --> 04:06:32,060
and can even thrive in the metallic sand

2579
04:06:32,060 --> 04:06:35,060
and harsh climate of the land.

2580
04:06:36,060 --> 04:06:38,060
In the Glen,

2581
04:06:38,060 --> 04:06:41,060
you can also grow dark on top of the moss layer

2582
04:06:41,060 --> 04:06:44,060
without competing with the moss for resources.

2583
04:06:45,060 --> 04:06:49,060
Radiocarbon-dating fossils suggest

2584
04:06:49,060 --> 04:06:51,060
that these plants

2585
04:06:51,060 --> 04:06:54,060
would be the first lifeforms of the Glen Lake Outer World.

2586
04:06:56,060 --> 04:06:58,060
Cool.

2587
04:07:08,060 --> 04:07:11,060
A book is working out, isn't it?

2588
04:07:12,060 --> 04:07:14,060
Oh.

2589
04:07:16,060 --> 04:07:19,060
Thankfully, Dr. Silver points to you

2590
04:07:19,060 --> 04:07:22,060
with able to replicate our prototype.

2591
04:07:24,060 --> 04:07:27,060
On the right is an update sketch

2592
04:07:27,060 --> 04:07:29,060
of some modifications

2593
04:07:29,060 --> 04:07:31,060
of the external design.

2594
04:07:31,060 --> 04:07:33,060
More importantly,

2595
04:07:33,060 --> 04:07:35,060
we used a radical,

2596
04:07:35,060 --> 04:07:40,060
we used a radically different architecture

2597
04:07:40,060 --> 04:07:42,060
rather than micro-processors.

2598
04:07:42,060 --> 04:07:45,060
Due to the limited resources this time,

2599
04:07:45,060 --> 04:07:49,060
it still should be able to deliver

2600
04:07:49,060 --> 04:07:53,060
a label delivering the Lake Broadmasters' message.

2601
04:07:53,060 --> 04:07:57,060
The teams suggested that taming will last cause.

2602
04:08:11,060 --> 04:08:14,060
It's a bun.

2603
04:08:16,060 --> 04:08:19,060
It's a stack of paper.

2604
04:08:19,060 --> 04:08:21,060
My new script.

2605
04:08:22,060 --> 04:08:24,060
A full background.

2606
04:08:25,060 --> 04:08:28,060
But she did believe in the multiverse theory

2607
04:08:28,060 --> 04:08:31,060
regarding alternate verses.

2608
04:08:31,060 --> 04:08:34,060
She liked the probability

2609
04:08:34,060 --> 04:08:36,060
of the rolling of dice.

2610
04:08:37,060 --> 04:08:39,060
Searchingly,

2611
04:08:39,060 --> 04:08:42,060
I found that very easier and easier to believe,

2612
04:08:42,060 --> 04:08:45,060
but I could not describe it very well back then.

2613
04:08:45,060 --> 04:08:47,060
Nevertheless,

2614
04:08:47,060 --> 04:08:50,060
I still wrote it to the best of my abilities.

2615
04:08:50,060 --> 04:08:53,060
After all, it felt only right to honor

2616
04:08:53,060 --> 04:08:55,060
how hard this way.

2617
04:08:55,060 --> 04:08:57,060
There are six.

2618
04:08:57,060 --> 04:09:00,060
Which one did you encounter?

2619
04:09:00,060 --> 04:09:02,060
Four.

2620
04:09:02,060 --> 04:09:04,060
I've encountered four.

2621
04:09:07,060 --> 04:09:10,060
So that I won't sleep again.

2622
04:09:14,060 --> 04:09:17,060
The bridge is full of bottled water

2623
04:09:17,060 --> 04:09:20,060
and take-out boxes.

2624
04:09:21,060 --> 04:09:23,060
Work, work, work.

2625
04:09:23,060 --> 04:09:25,060
Work, work.

2626
04:09:25,060 --> 04:09:27,060
Click the scanner

2627
04:09:27,060 --> 04:09:29,060
and the printer.

2628
04:09:29,060 --> 04:09:31,060
I'm pretty sure you said something about

2629
04:09:31,060 --> 04:09:34,060
unupdated databases.

2630
04:09:34,060 --> 04:09:36,060
Unupdated databases.

2631
04:09:36,060 --> 04:09:38,060
Oh, man.

2632
04:09:38,060 --> 04:09:40,060
I see those here.

2633
04:09:49,060 --> 04:09:51,060
Work, work, work.

2634
04:09:51,060 --> 04:09:53,060
Work, work, work.

2635
04:09:53,060 --> 04:09:55,060
I keep a cover of everything that I published

2636
04:09:55,060 --> 04:09:57,060
for him in the archival room.

2637
04:09:57,060 --> 04:09:59,060
He didn't read some of it.

2638
04:10:00,060 --> 04:10:02,060
He didn't read some.

2639
04:10:02,060 --> 04:10:04,060
There are even illustrations.

2640
04:10:04,060 --> 04:10:06,060
Kids like pictures.

2641
04:10:06,060 --> 04:10:08,060
Right?

2642
04:10:12,060 --> 04:10:14,060
It's like a box back there.

2643
04:10:16,060 --> 04:10:18,060
And the painting is a box.

2644
04:10:32,060 --> 04:10:34,060
Hi, travel good night.

2645
04:10:34,060 --> 04:10:36,060
Thank you for stopping by today's stream.

2646
04:10:36,060 --> 04:10:38,060
I appreciate that.

2647
04:10:38,060 --> 04:10:40,060
Appreciate you.

2648
04:10:51,060 --> 04:10:53,060
Maybe...

2649
04:10:56,060 --> 04:10:59,060
Are you guys really trying to give me that?

2650
04:11:00,060 --> 04:11:02,060
To lengthen this?

2651
04:11:04,060 --> 04:11:07,060
I thought this game was going to be super short.

2652
04:11:07,060 --> 04:11:09,060
Like, not short.

2653
04:11:09,060 --> 04:11:11,060
I thought I could finish this game much faster.

2654
04:11:11,060 --> 04:11:13,060
But I get so distracted.

2655
04:11:13,060 --> 04:11:17,060
And then I don't even finish anything.

2656
04:11:20,060 --> 04:11:22,060
I'm ready yet.

2657
04:11:22,060 --> 04:11:24,060
Do you have any questions about books?

2658
04:11:24,060 --> 04:11:26,060
I can answer them.

2659
04:11:26,060 --> 04:11:28,060
I love books.

2660
04:11:30,060 --> 04:11:32,060
Haha.

2661
04:11:33,060 --> 04:11:35,060
It's about four to five hours to refresh it.

2662
04:11:35,060 --> 04:11:37,060
I thought I could.

2663
04:11:37,060 --> 04:11:39,060
I thought I could do that.

2664
04:11:39,060 --> 04:11:41,060
But I'm so slow.

2665
04:11:47,060 --> 04:11:49,060
I'm so slow.

2666
04:11:54,060 --> 04:11:56,060
Yeah.

2667
04:12:00,060 --> 04:12:02,060
Yes, I was only at the rest.

2668
04:12:05,060 --> 04:12:08,060
Can I share this strange journal?

2669
04:12:08,060 --> 04:12:10,060
Do you like this?

2670
04:12:10,060 --> 04:12:12,060
Oh, I did have this.

2671
04:12:12,060 --> 04:12:14,060
I think it's written in some kind of...

2672
04:12:14,060 --> 04:12:16,060
Swiss.

2673
04:12:16,060 --> 04:12:18,060
I moved my microphone something.

2674
04:12:20,060 --> 04:12:22,060
I'm leaning back.

2675
04:12:22,060 --> 04:12:24,060
Wrapped in a blanket right now.

2676
04:12:25,060 --> 04:12:27,060
Haha.

2677
04:12:27,060 --> 04:12:30,060
It was so cozy.

2678
04:12:30,060 --> 04:12:32,060
I was so cozy and comfy.

2679
04:12:33,060 --> 04:12:35,060
Haha.

2680
04:12:53,060 --> 04:12:55,060
I'm fine. I'm fine, thank you.

2681
04:12:58,060 --> 04:13:00,060
Damn mosquito.

2682
04:13:02,060 --> 04:13:04,060
I'm going to squish it when I get the chance.

2683
04:13:07,060 --> 04:13:10,060
He'll rule the day that he fucked with me.

2684
04:13:15,060 --> 04:13:17,060
I'll absolutely obliterate him.

2685
04:13:23,060 --> 04:13:25,060
I'll clap him with these shakes.

2686
04:13:25,060 --> 04:13:27,060
Haha.

2687
04:13:31,060 --> 04:13:33,060
Ow.

2688
04:13:35,060 --> 04:13:37,060
I think it's written in some sort of word.

2689
04:13:37,060 --> 04:13:39,060
I don't recognize it.

2690
04:13:39,060 --> 04:13:41,060
Oh my gosh.

2691
04:13:41,060 --> 04:13:43,060
It's a book.

2692
04:13:49,060 --> 04:13:51,060
It's not just any book.

2693
04:13:51,060 --> 04:13:53,060
Golly, which one is this?

2694
04:13:53,060 --> 04:13:55,060
Somewhere in the baron?

2695
04:13:55,060 --> 04:13:57,060
Oh.

2696
04:13:57,060 --> 04:13:59,060
We found it.

2697
04:13:59,060 --> 04:14:01,060
A safe.

2698
04:14:01,060 --> 04:14:03,060
Where is that?

2699
04:14:03,060 --> 04:14:05,060
To the cell?

2700
04:14:05,060 --> 04:14:07,060
In that case.

2701
04:14:07,060 --> 04:14:09,060
What do I have to do now?

2702
04:14:09,060 --> 04:14:11,060
And where is the journal?

2703
04:14:11,060 --> 04:14:13,060
Oh cool.

2704
04:14:13,060 --> 04:14:15,060
It might take a while though.

2705
04:14:15,060 --> 04:14:17,060
That's fine.

2706
04:14:17,060 --> 04:14:19,060
Excuse me.

2707

You look really tired.

2709
04:14:23,060 --> 04:14:25,060
A little bit.

2710
04:14:25,060 --> 04:14:27,060
Yeah.

2711
04:14:27,060 --> 04:14:29,060
A little bit.

2712
04:14:29,060 --> 04:14:31,060
A little bit.

2713
04:14:31,060 --> 04:14:33,060
So we finished this game like next week.

2714
04:14:43,060 --> 04:14:45,060
Can I just add it?

2715
04:14:45,060 --> 04:14:47,060

2716
04:14:47,060 --> 04:14:49,060

2722
04:15:09,060 --> 04:15:11,060
Four parts is insane.

2723
04:15:11,060 --> 04:15:13,060
Am I just slow and dumb?

2724
04:15:17,060 --> 04:15:19,060
Why am I so slow and dumb?

2744
04:16:37,060 --> 04:16:39,060
