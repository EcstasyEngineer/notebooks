Hello?
What the heck?
I'm back.
I'm back.
I'm home.
I want to be here in the chat room with you.
Yes I'm home.
What the heck?

What is this?
It's pissing me off.
Is it because I'm eating a hot dog?
I found hot dogs.
I saw one made hot dogs, I'm eating it.
But I did say, I think, if, I don't know if you heard me or not, but I did say I'd stream
around this time in the future.
Majority of my streams are at night, but that was just for the beginning.
I'm getting in to the valour.
We wanted to have a consistent stream time, but
but I do plan to do noon streams or morning streams in the future.
So maybe one day you'll be able to catch those streams as well.
I have no clue why it's so broken.
I Google that anyone who's running on like the same Internet kind of
service is having issues as well.
It's not just me.
It seems to be like a whole city wide thing.
I was extremely fun and chaotic club.
I enjoyed that a lot.
Oh, that was so good.
Happy.
I think we're back though, right?
No issues right now.
I could go for another hot dog.
Oh no.
No, please.
Help.
I hear a fine.
We're fine.
Having consistency is totally fine.
It's also better for your planning as well.
But I'm all right.
I'll just look forward to times.
I'll be able to watch.
I'm glad.
I'm happy you understand.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry.
I feel a little bad streaming at such EU times.
But I am a cozy streamer.
So I thought that streaming at night would be a way better than streaming midday.
You know.
But then I realized that there's so many of you who are in different time zones.
So I didn't really think to put you into it.
I just said, well, that's nighttime for me when I want to feel the cozy is right before bed.
So I chose that time to stream.
It's 421 for me as well.
It's 421 pm for me.
I usually just been streaming around 8 o'clock.
And that's the time this stream was supposed to have took place.
Let me pull this game up.
I'm a little sad though.
I really wanted to play it in powerwatch.
It's really my first time playing it.
And it just went like a...
It went so chaotic.
I'm so sad.
I'm so sad.
I'm so sad.
I'm so sad.
I'm so sad.
I'm so sad.
I'm so sad.
I'm so sad.
I'm so sad.
I'm so sad.
I'm so sad.
I'm so chaotic.
So bad.
I'm so chaotic.
And hopefully we'll be able to play it next time.
I will look forward to next time.
Maybe my internet will be better.
It will be better than...
Right now I'm running on like the cheapest internet ever in my city.
I can't afford...
I can't afford the other internet stuff.
So yeah, the cheapest internet.
So it goes down every now and then.
I don't have a life that I guess I'm gonna do.
Yay!
I don't have one either.
This is my life.
This is my life.
Yay!
I don't like raccoons.
You know, they're more active at night.
Okay.
And our stud.
I have fun time Friday.
I hope you get an upgrade in the future.
Yeah.
With all of your support and help.
I'm sure I will probably have better internet.
A better internet anytime.
I'm sure, I'm sure.
Yeah, the club is extremely fun.
I also can't wait for more.
Alright.
Wow!
Nope.
Oh, sorry.
I'm so not...
I'm so unprepared.
Flight everything.
Yeah.
I'm so cold.
Arctic and docksbox are absolutely good at clubs for sure, yeah.
They were our heroes saved us.
Just still being able to do something.
Yeah.
It was the best paraglider simulation.
The best.
Alright guys, let me know if my microphone is peaking or something.
Do not hesitate to tell me okay.
Do not let me have poopy mic like before.
Yeah, play more stars in the valley.
Yeah.
BGM is on.
Why is this game so loud?
What the hell?
Why is it so loud?
Hang on.
Is this game not loud for anyone else?
BGM is on.
You didn't see any of those.
Sorry.
You didn't see any of those?
You didn't see any of those?
Okay, that wasn't there.

Why is this so loud when you play?
Why is this so loud when you take mi unterstüt or微 звон insurance?
Why did you do something Zhi did to scare your song?
It's a mystery to me that I haven't played sticky rice files before.
It's a mystery to me that I haven't played sticky rice phones before.

I can't.
I can't.
This is just too loud for me.
This is just too loud for me.
It's none of this.
It's just so loud.
It's just so loud.
Is it quiet for you guys now?
It's so loud.
It's so much better.
I did.
It's completely lowered for me.
It's at 15%
and it's just blasting in my ears.
I tried.
It was not working.
Everything is still so loud.
I don't know what the cause is.
Why all of a sudden it's so loud?
Yeah, it does.
I turned it down
as well.
But I want to also make sure I hear
notifications and stuff.
I turn it back up a little bit
for you guys.
Just a little bit.
It's like all my settings
reset somehow.
It's so strange.
Hi everyone.
Hi.
Right now we're just going to play.
I don't...
I can't answer yet.
Oh, that's what that is.
This is fine.
Everything is fine.

I don't know what is going on right now.
I don't know what is going on right now.
There's a stranger in my house.
I don't know what is going on right now.
I don't know.
There's no way you can be who you say you are.
Gotta be someone else.
Cause that wasn't me.
I'm not totally wasn't me.
So I don't know what you saw cause that wasn't me.
I'm glad she went great. That was amazing. I enjoyed it.
I don't know what you saw cause that wasn't me.

I don't know what you saw cause that wasn't me.
Sounds delish.
More please.
More please.
I told you.
It was voted.
That is what it must be.
I don't know what you saw cause that wasn't me.
I don't know what you saw cause that wasn't me.
So much stuff got broken.
So much stuff got broken.
I don't know what you saw cause that wasn't me.
I haven't done anything with her yet.
Thank you for liking my farm even though it's so empty.

I don't know what you saw cause that wasn't me.
I don't know what you saw cause that wasn't me.
Oh, I got caught.
How much friendship do you lose?
I lost a whole heart.
It's like you filthy ingrate.
I want to play the Jamias on the stream but I know I can't.
Thank you so much and welcome back home.
Thank you for the $5 to help them later.
Thank you, thank you.
It's so sweet of you.
I think turnips or fast cabbage might only be 4 or 5 days.
I don't think I can grow cabbage in the spring.
This takes a long time.
I don't think this grows in 4 or 5 days.
I think it takes much longer.
I planted this some time ago.
It goes on the internet.
I know my stream...
I'm glad I'm able to put a smile on all your faces.
I know my streams are very chill and very chaotic in the sense of very scuffed streams.
I'm probably entertaining and very annoying.
Thank you for the $5 to help them later.

If I lose it all, sleeping fall Will you laugh at me? If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all, lose it all, lose it all, lose it all, sleeping fall
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all, lose it all, if I lose it all, I'll sign a wall to die another day I don't want to be in the future
The ball
Bromble it, bromble it
The you
Bromble it, bromble it
