01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
You

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000

03:30.000 --> 03:50.000
You

03:50.000 --> 04:06.000
You

04:06.000 --> 04:18.000
You

04:18.000 --> 04:30.000
You

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
You

04:32.000 --> 04:44.000
You

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
You

04:50.000 --> 04:58.000
You

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
You

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
You

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
You

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
You

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
You

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Hopefully they won't mind, hopefully.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Hey.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Ugh.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Stressful?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Aw.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Usually this helps out a lot of your work.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Work can be very stressful.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
I'm hoping that your day gets better as we go.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Way better now, that's good.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Hugs friends, Laura?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Thank you.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Hmm.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Far from that I'm not active.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
I'm currently watching an elderly dog for a friend.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Oh, I hope the dog is okay though.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
I mean, it never reminds me of when I was working with dogs.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
There was this really old dog that was like,

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
obsessed with me.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Will follow me everywhere.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Will leave me alone.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
And the other ones which is lay on my lap.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Oh no, won't buggy.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Buggies are so cute.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I love them.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
I like doggies a lot.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Am I easily scared?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Depends.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Depends.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
I think my form of fear of games is,

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
of like a scary game is like,

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
the act of being like,

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
realistically chased.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Sort of like, my biggest fear.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
The game that made me like, drool.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
When I screamed.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
I think it was, um, Alien Isolation.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
I don't think anyone's ever gonna give me to play that game.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
What?

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
I don't think anyone's gonna ever give me to play that game.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Not in a million years.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Sorry, I meant to go turn on my light.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
I didn't even make it past the tutorial.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
I didn't even finish the tutorial.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
That's how scared I was of that game.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Less than three?

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
That's funny.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I love you too.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Love you too.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Thank you so much for the six dollars that we won.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Thank you, thank you.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Have you ever played Resident Evil or Death Space?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I played a little bit of Death Space

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
and I like the Resident Evil series, so yeah.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Death Space is still kind of scary.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Death Space is kind of very scary.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Resident Evil not so much.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
I don't know.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Ah, that big dog. Best toys ever.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
I'm very sorry.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
My condolences were lost.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
My body was a good doggy.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Very good doggy.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Me?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
I'm just reading, child.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Sorry.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
It's very hot. You're so squishy.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Am I?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Super soft and warm.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Thank you.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
I'm not discouraged, don't worry.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
It might be disappointing as a whole, but don't worry.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I'll be okay.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Oh.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
I just hang on in there and keep on streaming like normal.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
I appreciate your concern, though.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
A lot.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
And I don't think I'm the best out of the Villalor girls.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I don't think I'm the best.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Um.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
But I do appreciate that it's very sweet.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
Thank you for the $1.00 details, Villalor.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
As a Villalor.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
I've been talking so much lately.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
You know, like when you work out and your muscles get sore?

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Oh, thank you so much.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
You're so sweet.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Thank you.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Thank you for the $4.00.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Thank you, Papa.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Appreciate it.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Thank you.

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
You know how when you exercise and you work out and your muscles get sore?

12:59.000 --> 13:08.000
I've been talking so much that my, my neck, my actual neck is sore.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
It hurts to touch.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
I've been using my neck muscles.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
So much now that my throat is like sore.

13:43.000 --> 13:58.000
I don't really take any more morning pills or morning medication.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
All my medication is always taken at night.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Always at night.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
Speaking of which, let me turn off that alarm for today.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Sorry to do that.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Scared me.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
I read that wrong.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Sorry.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
I'm so glad.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I wish you good luck at a run.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I hope you have a good stream.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Oh, it's nice to you.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Thank you for stopping by.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Appreciate you.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
Um, how do you came to just say hello?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Okay, um,

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
I bought the hoodie and joggers.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I can't wait for them.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
I'm excited.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Well, thank you for buying the merch.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
Alright, I hope you enjoy and feel comfy and cozy and dumb.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Appreciate you.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Thank you.

15:20.000 --> 15:46.000
If anyone else wants merch, go ahead and just go in the description down below and you can get your merch there.

15:50.000 --> 15:56.000
I hope you spend another great day with you, especially since I had a very bad day at work.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
I'm sorry you had a really bad day at work.

15:59.000 --> 16:09.000
I hope that you enjoy your time here and the stream and you feel much better as we play.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
Thank you so much for $5 to be all for fun.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Thank you, thank you.

16:20.000 --> 16:30.000
Because you said big yawn, I ended up yawning.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I was trying to hold it in.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Look what you did.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
I need to turn this up, so give me one second.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Let me turn this up.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Alright, can you guys hear me a little better?

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
Is this better or worse?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Better or worse?

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
Or can I be a little louder?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I think it should be fine.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Right here?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Oh goodness.

17:18.000 --> 17:29.000
Okay, I don't want to make too loud of a noise or something.

17:29.000 --> 17:36.000
It's going to be extremely loud because small noises that I make can get really loud.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
So I just want to be careful about that.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
More Pog.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Pog?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Pog.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Pog.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Ah.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Ah.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Ah.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Are you guys ready to play?

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
I have none, I don't really, I didn't, oh.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
I mean, I don't want you guys to worry.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
I don't want to, I didn't want to tell you about this.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I didn't want you guys to worry.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
I sat here and I debated it in my head.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Should I tell them?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Should I tell them?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Okay, okay.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Okay, okay, okay.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
It's not bad, it's really not bad.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
It's okay, it's fine.

19:53.000 --> 20:01.000
I have like a vacuum cleaner and I was cleaning up and the vacuum pinched my finger.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
It's fine.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
The swelling went down a little bit.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
I keep playing with my finger.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
It's like a little purple on one side.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
It's like purple on the part that got pinched.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Like purple and numb.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
I have sensitive skin.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
If I got like tapped, like that area is going to turn purple.

20:36.000 --> 20:42.000
It's normal, it's normal, it's normal.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Do not be worried, it's fine.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I think it's fine.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
I was just contemplating on whether or not my finger is okay.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
She's a scared toe.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
I'm not losing my toe, my toe is fine.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
And I said I pinched my finger, not my toe.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Can I guess the booboo?

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
If she's going to kiss the booboo.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Yes, you can kiss the booboo.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Yeah, you can kiss the booboo.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
No, not my precious vacuum.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
It keeps my floor clean.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
I might be like, I might have clutter in my room,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
but I really don't like crumbs.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Crumbs annoy me.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
But I don't hurt my vacuum.

22:06.000 --> 22:12.000
I don't like, I really like to keep things tidy in a specific way.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
I'm sorry, that was my OCD speaking.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
I had slight panic in my brain about my vacuum being broken,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
and it made me feel very sad.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
No, not the vacuum, please.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
No, no.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Mm-hmm.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
Viking funeral for a vacuum.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Wow.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Wow.

23:15.000 --> 23:27.000
Okay, what is this?

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
Oh, I'm ready when I'm not.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I thought I was ready.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
I'm not ready.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
I'm not ready, I'm not ready, you know.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
Booboo.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
Where does this keep coming from?

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
I always delete this, and it always comes back.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
That's so strange.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Mm-hmm.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
It's very strange.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
It's not super scuffed, what do you mean?

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
It's fine, we're not scuffed yet.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
We're fine, we're fine.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
I do not have malware issues.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
I was only deleting a file on OBS that somehow keeps coming back.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
It won't go away.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
Leave me alone, go away.

25:04.000 --> 25:09.000
I used to one time, leave me alone.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
We're fine, we're fine.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Okay, now I turn this off.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Okay.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Oh, like this.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Oh, we got it.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Yay.

25:33.000 --> 25:40.000
Now he's going to switch over now and prepares for the games.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Ha ha ha.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
See, no scoof.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
We're fine, no scoof.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
No scoof, no scoof.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
No, no, no.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
No, no.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
No, scoof.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
No, scoof.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
No, scoof.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
No, no, no.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Mm-hmm.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Oh

26:32.920 --> 26:38.400
Should I dim the lights for me for your eyes for your eyes

40:19.440 --> 40:29.440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

40:29.440 --> 40:39.440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

40:39.440 --> 40:48.440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

40:48.440 --> 40:58.440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

40:58.440 --> 41:08.440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

41:08.440 --> 41:23.440
What is that?

41:23.440 --> 41:37.440
Ew.

41:37.440 --> 41:40.440

41:40.440 --> 41:47.440
I'm so nervous. I don't even know what to say. You don't understand. I'm so scared.

41:47.440 --> 41:52.440
I'm so scared.

41:52.440 --> 41:59.440
I'm so scared. I'm so nervous. Am I supposed to be back here?

41:59.440 --> 42:02.440
Do I have to take out the lighter?

42:02.440 --> 42:19.440
That's a wall.

42:19.440 --> 42:41.440
No, bring that back. It's dark.

42:41.440 --> 43:01.440
Okay, what do I do in here?

43:01.440 --> 43:29.440
I'm really not good with puzzles. I don't think there'd be puzzles in here.

43:29.440 --> 43:34.440
Can I push that?

43:34.440 --> 43:50.440
Yeah, I noticed the handprint on the fridge.

43:50.440 --> 44:03.440
Can I grab this? No, I can't grab anything.

44:03.440 --> 44:11.440
I thought I had to push this or something, but I can't do that either.

44:11.440 --> 44:40.440
I can't climb up here.

44:40.440 --> 45:09.440
I think I have to be in this room.

45:09.440 --> 45:38.440
Okay, the little thing ran over here.

45:38.440 --> 45:47.440
Is it on here? Oh, yes.

45:47.440 --> 46:09.440
The nose.

46:09.440 --> 46:13.440
I can't take a win me.

46:13.440 --> 46:38.440
I can't jump. You just hold the button and hold up.

46:38.440 --> 46:51.440
I can't climb.

46:51.440 --> 47:04.440
Is that a reach?

47:04.440 --> 47:24.440
I can't reach.

47:25.440 --> 47:53.440
I can't reach.

47:53.440 --> 48:02.440
I can't reach.

48:02.440 --> 48:22.440
I can't reach.

48:22.440 --> 48:43.440
I can't run. Where am I supposed to go?

48:44.440 --> 48:59.440
No! It wouldn't let me run. I couldn't run.

48:59.440 --> 49:28.440
This way, I think.

49:29.440 --> 49:38.440
Climb. Climb. There you go.

49:38.440 --> 50:00.440
Uh-oh.

50:00.440 --> 50:29.440
I'm not scared of you.

50:30.440 --> 50:40.440
I'm not scared of you.

51:10.440 --> 51:39.440
I'm so nervous.

51:39.440 --> 51:49.440
There's another thingy.

51:49.440 --> 51:52.440
What is that on the door?

51:52.440 --> 51:58.440
Isn't that eyeball?

51:58.440 --> 52:13.440
Is this toilet?

52:14.440 --> 52:28.440
Did you see that?

52:28.440 --> 52:57.440
I'm not scared of you.

52:57.440 --> 53:07.440
I'm not scared of you.

53:07.440 --> 53:27.440
I'm not scared of you.

53:27.440 --> 53:52.440
I can't reach that. It's too high up.

53:53.440 --> 54:10.440
That's a timer.

54:10.440 --> 54:17.440
Why is there kids toys?

54:17.440 --> 54:40.440
Yeah. That's kind of scary.

54:40.440 --> 55:00.440
I'm not scared of you.

55:00.440 --> 55:09.440
That's nice.

55:09.440 --> 55:29.440
I'm not scared of you.

55:29.440 --> 55:39.440
I'm not scared of you.

55:39.440 --> 55:49.440
I'm not scared of you.

55:49.440 --> 56:09.440
I'm not scared of you.

56:09.440 --> 56:29.440
I'm not scared of you.

56:29.440 --> 56:36.440
Are we supposed to come back in here?

56:36.440 --> 56:40.440
Do we have to run all the way across the room?

56:40.440 --> 57:07.440
Like really fast?

57:07.440 --> 57:13.440
Is there anything in the way?

57:13.440 --> 57:42.440
I'm not scared of you.

57:42.440 --> 57:53.440
This isn't very dangerous.

57:53.440 --> 58:00.440
Nah.

58:00.440 --> 58:04.440
I don't like that.

58:04.440 --> 58:14.440
It's my lucky block.

58:14.440 --> 58:38.440
Is it something that can hear me?

58:38.440 --> 58:58.440
I can't take the block with me.

58:58.440 --> 59:27.440
Can I jump and climb now?

59:27.440 --> 59:34.440
Can I go up?

59:34.440 --> 59:42.440
I want to help them.

59:42.440 --> 59:51.440
I'll climb up.

59:51.440 --> 01:00:08.440
With this?

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:12.440
I thought he was trapped.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.440
Are they not trapped?

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:28.440
What's up here?

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:39.440
I am lucky.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:52.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:59.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:09.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:19.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:29.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:49.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:02:14.440
I know me.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:24.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:44.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:03:04.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:14.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:42.440
I'm scared.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:52.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:04:12.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:22.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:32.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:42.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:52.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:05:02.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:22.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:42.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:06:02.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:22.440
I don't know which way to go.

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:32.440
We're hungry.

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:42.440
We're hungry.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:52.440
I know this feeling on too well.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:07:02.440
I'm going to give it to me.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:12.440
Was that bread? Why is it so squelchy?

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:24.440
Thank you.

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:38.440
What did I eat? Was that bread?

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:44.440
My dear mommy, you got this. I've got some free time so I'll watch you.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:48.440
Thank you. I appreciate that.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:56.440
Thank you for the $5 tipi.

01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:02.440
I hope you'll join me in your free time.

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:20.440
It's a noose.

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:40.440
It's too shower.

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:54.440
There's so many cages.

01:08:54.440 --> 01:09:06.440
I got to remember that you don't press space when climbing. Do not press space.

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:16.440
What was that?

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:42.440
What was that?

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:58.440
Now what?

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:14.440
What was that?

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:34.440
What was that?

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:52.440
That noise.

01:10:52.440 --> 01:11:16.440
Am I supposed to do something with this?

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:36.440
What was that?

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:52.440
That's a long fall.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:12:14.440
Is that supposed to be up here?

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:32.440
I pressed space by accident.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:40.440
Can I push this? No.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:48.440
I won't get it.

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:52.440
What am I supposed to do here?

01:12:52.440 --> 01:13:06.440
I climbed that.

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:16.440
Keep climbing.

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:28.440
Not then.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:46.440
There's a little water here. What did this go to?

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:56.440
What do you pull first?

01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:06.440
What was that?

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:16.440
What was that?

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:44.440
I'm a genius.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:54.440
I'm a genius.

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:38.440
I can't let me climb it now.

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:48.440
I'm stuck.

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:58.440
I'm stuck.

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:18.440
I'm stuck.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:28.440
I'm stuck.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:56.440
I'm stuck.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:06.440
I'm stuck.

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:16.440
I'm stuck.

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:42.440
Nothing else in here?

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:52.440
I'm stuck.

01:17:52.440 --> 01:18:12.440
I'm stuck.

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:22.440
I'm stuck.

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:32.440
I'm stuck.

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:52.440
I'm stuck.

01:18:52.440 --> 01:19:02.440
I'm stuck.

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:12.440
I'm stuck.

01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:22.440
I'm stuck.

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:48.440
I'm stuck.

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:58.440
I'm stuck.

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:08.440
I'm stuck.

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:18.440
I'm stuck.

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:28.440
I'm stuck.

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:48.440
I'm stuck.

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:58.440
Hey, isn't this where it was before?

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:08.440
Where are the children?

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:24.440
Oh, no.

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:40.440
Why is this area all of a sudden really dark and scary?

01:21:40.440 --> 01:22:00.440
I don't like this camera angle. Why do I feel like something's going to come?

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:28.440
I'm stuck.

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:38.440
I'm stuck.

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:48.440
I'm stuck.

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:58.440
I'm stuck.

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:18.440

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:44.440
I'm stuck.

01:23:44.440 --> 01:24:00.440
I'm stuck.

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:26.440
I don't know what sound came out of me.

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:36.440
Why is this so scary? I don't like that. It's scary.

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:52.440
It's so scary.

01:24:52.440 --> 01:25:16.440
I'm stuck.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:36.440
I'm stuck.

01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:54.440
That was dark.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:26:02.440
Oh, it's the gnomes.

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:22.440
I made it out.

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:32.440

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:42.440

01:26:52.440 --> 01:27:12.440
I'm stuck.

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:32.440
I'm stuck.

01:27:32.440 --> 01:28:00.440
I'm stuck.

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:10.440

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:30.440
I'm stuck.

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:40.440
I want to go up there. I want to know what's up there.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:29:06.440
What's up here? Am I going to fall again?

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:16.440
What's in here?

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:56.440
Am I going to fall again?

01:29:56.440 --> 01:30:06.440

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:36.440
Am I going to fall again?

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:58.440
I don't know what's in there.

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:18.440
Is this an entire area?

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:28.440
It's not open.

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:38.440
I can't see.

01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:48.440
It's a floor.

01:31:48.440 --> 01:32:02.440
If I go in there, then I can't go up the stairs.

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:30.440
The chair.

01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:40.440
I want to know what's up the stairs.

01:32:40.440 --> 01:33:08.440
What's up here?

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:28.440
It's a door.

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:36.440
What if I fall?

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:46.440
The stairs are evil.

01:33:46.440 --> 01:34:14.440
Can I leave?

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:34.440
I'm stuck.

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:54.440
I want to go back.

01:34:54.440 --> 01:35:04.440
I didn't want to go.

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:14.440
I shouldn't have come up here.

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:42.440
Am I going to fall again?

01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:52.440

Am I going to fall again?

01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:38.440
I can't always do this key, not that we have a key.

01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:58.440
I don't know what's that.

01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:18.440
Am I going to fall again?

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:38.440
Am I going to fall again?

01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:48.440

01:38:48.440 --> 01:39:08.440

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:28.440
Am I going to fall again?

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:48.440
Am I going to fall again?

01:39:48.440 --> 01:40:08.440
Am I going to fall again?

01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:28.440

Am I going to fall again?

01:42:48.440 --> 01:43:02.440
Dang, no sympathy.

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:28.440
What's over here?

01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:40.440
Wait, am I going to make that?

01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:50.440
How do I make that?

01:43:50.440 --> 01:44:00.440
Downstairs, evil stairs.

01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:10.440
Do I just run?

01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:38.440
I'm doing it.

01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:58.440
Now the game wants to start giving me advice.

01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:18.440
How do I get in there?

01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:42.440
How do I get in there?

01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:52.440
What's the kid?

01:45:52.440 --> 01:46:10.440
Is the kid alive?

01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:20.440
They're definitely still alive, right?

01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:30.440

I'm so sad, my mom isn't here, she's not going to be here for a couple of days again.

01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:58.440
She's like never here, she's like never home.

01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:04.440
She left me something and I can get something.

This is amazing hearing you telling me he didn't hear that.

02:06:40.440 --> 02:07:02.440
I had to climb up there.

02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:22.440

02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:52.440

02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:08.440
Was I supposed to have put the thingy in there?

02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:24.440
Am I trapped?

02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:44.440
I have to go.

02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:48.440
I passed it a few times.

02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:54.440
Can you leave?

02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:56.440
Why are you breathing so hard?

02:10:56.440 --> 02:10:58.440
Why is he breathing so hard?

02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:00.440
Why is he still in here?

02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:04.440
Use monkeys?

02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:20.440
What if he turns around really fast?

02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:40.440
Okay.

02:11:40.440 --> 02:12:02.440
Hang on one second.

02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:20.440
Okay.

Thank you, food came. I have food now.

02:13:56.440 --> 02:14:08.440
Usually they like call you to let you know they're there, but they didn't call me this morning.

02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:26.440
They're their phone.

02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:44.440
I have beef, beef, beef broccoli, and white rice.

02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:54.440
I haven't had beef in a while.

02:14:54.440 --> 02:15:04.440
Okay.

02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:14.440
Okay.

02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:26.440
I'm so sorry if that hurt anyone's ears.

02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:34.440
I hit my hand on the microphone really, really hard.

02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:44.440
Hang on.

02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:24.440
Okay.

02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:56.440
Okay.

02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:06.440
Okay.

02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:26.440
Okay.

02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:36.440
Okay.

02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:46.440
Okay.

02:18:46.440 --> 02:18:56.440
Okay.

02:18:56.440 --> 02:19:06.440
Okay.

02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:16.440
Okay.

02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:44.440
Okay.

02:19:44.440 --> 02:20:00.440
Okay.

02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:12.440
I mean, like, it's so weird. There's sauce on the broccoli, but I don't taste the sauce. You know what I mean? There's sauce on the broccoli.

02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:32.440
Am I weird?

02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:42.440
Okay.

02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:54.440
Maybe there's like a few pieces of broccoli in here that just don't taste good.

02:20:54.440 --> 02:21:14.440
It's like a mix.

02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:34.440
Maybe you're getting sick and losing your sense of taste.

02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:50.440
I thought I hope not. If I get sick, I get sick for a really long time. I would have to take a few days off if I get really sick. If I get sick to the point I lose sense of taste.

02:21:50.440 --> 02:22:06.440
I would have to take a few days off once like symptoms start hitting me. My immune system takes a long time to fight stuff off.

02:22:06.440 --> 02:22:32.440
My immune system takes a long time. So I'd be sick in bed for a really long time. Sleeping. Long stop sleeping. Got a rest.

02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:44.440
The sauce. The sauce tastes funny. It's like they changed the sauce. Like it tastes different.

02:22:44.440 --> 02:23:04.440
I like celery too, but imagine eating something and tasting something entirely different. Just because you like that taste of the food that you usually eat doesn't mean you want to taste it in the food that you're eating right now.

02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:32.440
What you've been is the sauce? I don't even know. Does anyone ever question or know what's in their food when they order it?

02:23:32.440 --> 02:23:54.440
Really? So you go to a Chinese spot and you go what's in the sauce? What's in the sauce?

02:23:54.440 --> 02:24:04.440
What is in there?

02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:20.440
You think they'll really tell you?

02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:30.440
A secret formula?

02:24:50.440 --> 02:25:12.440
I want the secret formula.

02:25:12.440 --> 02:25:31.440
A secret formula.

02:25:31.440 --> 02:26:00.440
I think I know what it is. It's the combination of the rice and the sauce. Every time I put the rice and the sauce together and I eat it, the taste is very hard to describe.

02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:18.440
It doesn't taste great when you combine the rice and the sauce. Usually that's never the case. I'm confused why it's so bad right now.

02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:40.440
But the sauce with the meat and the broccoli is kind of okay, but when you combine the rice, it tastes kind of funny.

02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:48.440
It tastes a little funny.

02:26:48.440 --> 02:27:16.440
Yes, white rice, beef and broccoli.

02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:29.440
Yeah, it's a soda. I only drink the ginger ale. Nope. Ginger ale.

02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:51.440
Do you guys open your can halfway, not all the way? And then suck on it? I do that. I barely open it. I'm in my suck on it.

02:27:51.440 --> 02:28:02.440
I do it all the time. It's fun.

02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:27.440
But if you do that, remember to clean your can, clean the top of your can before you do that. If anyone ever gets curious to do it, wipe the top of your can.

02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:42.440
No, I don't like this. Sorry, excuse me. I really don't like this.

02:28:57.440 --> 02:29:18.440
That's a dub. No, thank you.

02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:28.440
That almost made me barf.

02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:42.440
Whatever sauce this is, the sauce ruined everything.

02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:58.440
I have a very sensitive stomach and taste buds. So I trust my gut.

02:29:58.440 --> 02:30:09.440
If my tongue tells me that this isn't good, I shouldn't eat it.

02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:19.440
Even my mom, my mom and my sister and all my other siblings trust my taste buds. They used to question it.

02:30:19.440 --> 02:30:25.440
They used to be like, oh, there's no way that every time you eat something in your tongue says it tastes bad that we shouldn't eat it.

02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:36.440
I'm like, go ahead, eat it. Then they either get food poisoning or they like throw it up or they get really sick.

02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:46.440
So whatever. I trust my tongue. I'm not eating that.

02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:56.440
My body, I tried to swallow it and then my body literally made it come back up. Nope. I'm good. I'm not going to eat it.

02:31:17.440 --> 02:31:44.440
Some of it that I already swallowed, my stomach is starting to hurt a little bit.

02:31:44.440 --> 02:32:03.440
Alright, it's fine. It was a burp. We're okay. We're okay. It was a burp. I'm just a tiny bit nauseous. That's all.

02:32:14.440 --> 02:32:34.440
I can eat this. I can't eat that. This is fine. But every time I eat that, it's not fine. What is that?

02:32:34.440 --> 02:32:47.440
Yeah, the rice. The rice is just not, it's not hitting me very well. I don't want to eat that. The other stuff is fine.

02:32:47.440 --> 02:33:11.440
But the rice was wrong with the rice. No, it's not overcooked, I don't think.

02:33:11.440 --> 02:33:31.440
Probably old rice, maybe. Every time I try to eat the rice, I get really nauseous. It tastes strange. Really strange. I don't like it. I don't like it.

02:33:31.440 --> 02:33:52.440
It's time for pancakes. I can't have sugar any more today. I already had pancakes earlier. Too much sugar. It's fine if I can eat some of it. It's fine as long as I eat something, right?

02:33:52.440 --> 02:34:11.440
It should be okay. Yeah.

02:34:11.440 --> 02:34:38.440
It wasn't burnt. It wasn't burnt. It wasn't a burnt pancake, okay? It was not burnt. It was nice pancake-y, okay? I made the pancake-y and it was good. My camera on my phone makes everything much darker. I don't know why. I can't fix it.

02:34:38.440 --> 02:35:05.440
The pancake was literally golden with brown edges. It was golden with brown edges. It was golden and had brown edges, but the camera made the edges look black. It's not my fault.

02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:32.440
It wasn't slimy. It was perfect. You know when you take a bite out of the edge and it goes crunch and then soft? Like the tiny, tiny little piece of the edge is crunch, crunch, crunch. And it's yummy.

02:35:32.440 --> 02:35:56.440
Just a little toasting. Well, it was fried. It was fried. I did use quite a bit of butter. And someone said that there was garlic on top of it. Why the heck would I put garlic on top of a pancake? It was melted butter. Melted butter.

02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:22.440
You will feel how there is melted butter.

02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:52.440
It's like how my grandpa used to make pancakes. Really? It was good. It's a lot of butter. Butter makes the edges really crispy.

02:36:53.440 --> 02:37:06.440
Edges of pancakes really crispy. It was super nice. It was super soft and really white on the inside. Like puffy, like puffy white.

02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:24.440
That was a good pancake, I mean. It was just one giant pancake. Someone asked if I dusted in syrup. I didn't. The syrup just like slid off the top all around the side. So it looked like it was like sitting in syrup.

02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:32.440
But trust it wasn't. It was just a tiny bit of syrup because I can't have too much sugar.

02:37:54.440 --> 02:38:14.440
The more you tease, the higher the chances of me eating you instead of my pancakes. The choice is yours. Promise.

02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:37.440
You'd be an honor. My body is ready.

02:38:55.440 --> 02:39:15.440
Imagine. I could see it. I want to get some art done. I don't want to draw it. I want to see a professional draw it. I want to do it. I want to get a professional draw certain things.

02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:30.440
I just need to see where, you know, where.

02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:37.440
Oh.

02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:41.440
Ha ha ha.

02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:56.440
I'm excited a little bit of this, but I am nauseous and I have a high sneaking suspicion that this is going to come right back up in like a few minutes.

02:39:56.440 --> 02:40:21.440
With the off chance that it doesn't, I eat it.

02:40:21.440 --> 02:40:23.440
Ew.

02:40:51.440 --> 02:41:12.440
I think this is going to make me sick. Continues eating it.

02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:28.440
Ew.

02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:32.440
I don't know what you're talking about.

02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:51.440
I'm hungry. It's better to eat it and then barf it up and let your body do the talking or eat it and chances you keep it down and then you're full. Bam, you have food in there and then the digest and you're fine.

02:41:51.440 --> 02:42:14.440
I have nutrition. You have food in there. You don't waste it. No waste food. You don't waste it. You eat some of it.

02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:43.440
If your body is really hungry and starving it will ignore some of the some of the bad stuff.

02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:58.440
If it's hungry enough, don't eat it. It will take it. Take what it can get.

02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:06.440
Yeah, it'll be fine. It's fine.

02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:33.440
Not to stop drinking this boil milk. Only if you're absolutely starving. But I don't recommend drinking spoiled milk or dairy.

02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:39.440
I've been drinking spoiled milk before.

02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:46.440
Those were the days.

02:43:46.440 --> 02:44:05.440
It was like absolutely nothing. Nothing in the fridge. I remember I hadn't eaten for days. I was so hungry. I was so hungry and my mom was out working so she was like never home and it was just me and my sibling, my younger sibling.

02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:25.440
And I was like, oh, yeah, I am so hungry. I took the cereal. It was like really stale cereal. I had born me a bowl and the milk was like kind of like chunky.

02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:41.440
And I sat on the floor, crouched on the floor with my sibling in front of me and we stared at the bowl and I was like, I'll eat it first if it kills me. Don't eat it.

02:44:55.440 --> 02:45:19.440
I couldn't let my younger sibling eat it and then what if they like perish and then I didn't want to meet my mom's wrath of letting my younger sibling eat the spoiled food.

02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:41.440
So I ate it. I ate a little bit of it and it made me so sick. I was so sick. Yeah, I saw it was spoiled. I was hungry. Excuse me.

02:45:41.440 --> 02:46:09.440
I was starving. Yeah, me and my sibling was starving. We were hungry. We were very hungry. I felt like something stuck in my throat. Oh my god.

02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:18.440
I hear a fine.

02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:28.440
A yogurt with spoiled milk. That sounds gross.

02:46:49.440 --> 02:47:08.440
I mean, I know yogurt is made out of that kind of like made out of that but don't you need like a special process to make it like like doesn't it take like a long time to make yogurt.

02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:26.440
It doesn't like all the bad stuff kind of need to be like filtered out of it. Did your mom do all of that? It's not that hard. I guess so people make their own cheese with spoiled milk so I'm not surprised.

02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:35.440
It still sounds gross.

02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:57.440
My long distance family member makes their own cheese with spoiled milk. They make a mozzarella cheese for their pizza.

02:47:57.440 --> 02:48:13.440
Well, I guess it's not spoiled milk. I guess it's normal milk before it spoils and they just warm it up and then make cheese with the milk. I don't think it's really spoiled though.

02:48:13.440 --> 02:48:36.440
Mozzarella cheese with mozzarella cheese. Yeah, soon to be spoiled. I mean homemade cheese is how you make cheese instead of having to go all the way out to go buy cheese you can make just make your own cheese.

02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:53.440
I remember making ice cream in school but you don't use spoiled milk to make ice cream. No more, no more, no more normal milk.

02:48:53.440 --> 02:49:04.440
I have another minute after that story.

02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:16.440
I mean you could but why? It would murder you. You know.

02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:33.440
You know sherbet ice cream? You know I can't eat that. I can't have sherbet ice cream.

02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:52.440
I will absolutely destroy my stomach beyond what anything else I can eat. I don't know. I think it's the sugar because sherbet ice cream does have a ton of sugar.

02:49:52.440 --> 02:50:15.440
I think it's the sugar but I cannot have sherbet. I used to eat so much of it. I think I like gained that thing. I used to eat so much sherbet ice cream in the past when I was younger. I used to eat so much of it.

02:50:15.440 --> 02:50:36.440
And then after a little while like years later all of a sudden every time I ate it I was in excruciating pain. I was in so much pain. It was so bad.

02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:49.440
And then I would test it. I would I bought another one again. Like not recently but like a few years ago I bought one and I was like I'm gonna test it and only eat a tiny bit. Just two spoonfuls.

02:50:49.440 --> 02:51:00.440
My stomach. That was it. I couldn't eat it. It's impossible. It's absolutely impossible.

02:51:00.440 --> 02:51:12.440
Well because my doctor said the only way to find out if I have an actual intolerance the stuff is to eat them. So I was testing it by eating it.

02:51:12.440 --> 02:51:23.440
My doctor was like well the only way to know is to eat it. And I was like okay. And I ate it. And then I was like.

02:51:23.440 --> 02:51:47.440
Yeah I actually have the mess around to find out.

02:51:48.440 --> 02:52:00.440
That was years ago when I had the huge humongous stomach aches. Then I stopped eating it for a couple of years. And then my doctor was like and then I got a new doctor and my doctor was like what can you not eat.

02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:13.440
And I said sherbet ice cream. It makes my stomach hurt. And I was like are you sure. And I was like well like what if it doesn't hurt now. And I was like I don't know.

02:52:13.440 --> 02:52:23.440
I haven't eaten it since then because it made my stomach hurt. And I was like well the only way you can know is to eat it. And I was like okay.

02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:37.440
I guess I'll taste it again. And yes. And I ate it again. I had to do the same thing with cheese and everything else. They made me eat it again.

02:52:37.440 --> 02:52:58.440
And I went back in and they were like so what can you not eat. And I was like oh yeah for sure sherbet ice cream can't eat that.

02:52:58.440 --> 02:53:12.440
Was that loud. I was drinking soda. Was that loud. I really thought I turned that off. I guess I didn't. I think I forgot to turn it off.

02:53:29.440 --> 02:53:35.440
No.

02:53:35.440 --> 02:53:45.440
No.

02:53:45.440 --> 02:53:51.440
Help me. Help me.

02:53:51.440 --> 02:53:59.440
Help me.

02:53:59.440 --> 02:54:03.440
Help me.

02:54:21.440 --> 02:54:35.440
Was it realistic that you thought it was real.

02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:43.440
I can't do this anymore.

02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:48.440
Help me.

02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:50.440
I can't take it.

02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:54.440
Help me.

02:54:54.440 --> 02:55:09.560
oh shit I drilled oh man

02:55:24.440 --> 02:55:50.880
yeah yeah yeah would you think you're acting like a zombie

02:55:50.880 --> 02:56:20.760
I'm a zombie

02:56:20.760 --> 02:56:28.520
I love you zombie

02:56:50.760 --> 02:57:15.720
I don't know why I think that you like that I at first I thought the YouTube emotes were

02:57:15.720 --> 02:57:20.720
a little silly looking but they're growing on me I don't know why they're really growing

02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:48.720
on me. I think I really like some of these YouTube emotes. I think they're great.

02:57:50.720 --> 02:58:18.680
So we stop procrastinating. I don't like that one. I don't I don't like that one. No that one I

02:58:18.680 --> 02:58:47.680
don't like it. So what about this one? No, I don't like that one. I don't like it.

02:58:47.680 --> 02:58:54.680
The game scared you so far. What do you think? What do you think?

02:59:17.680 --> 02:59:46.680
I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it.

02:59:46.680 --> 03:00:15.680
I didn't mean to do that. I pressed the wrong button. I pressed the wrong button. I pressed the wrong button.

03:00:15.680 --> 03:00:44.680
I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it.

03:00:44.680 --> 03:00:59.680
I don't like it. I don't like it.

03:00:59.680 --> 03:01:23.680
I don't like it. I don't like it.

03:01:23.680 --> 03:01:52.680
I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it.

03:01:52.680 --> 03:02:21.680
I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it.

03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:51.680
I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it.

03:02:51.680 --> 03:03:12.680
I can't see. This is on my way. I have to move it. You gotta go up there. On my way. I'm scared.

03:03:12.680 --> 03:03:41.680
I'm scared.

03:03:41.680 --> 03:03:52.680
What's wrong?

03:03:52.680 --> 03:04:09.680
No. No, no, no.

03:04:09.680 --> 03:04:19.680
No, no, no, no.

03:04:19.680 --> 03:04:48.680
What are you supposed to do there?

I can try and do tingles but I'm not too sure.

03:43:09.680 --> 03:43:16.680
I'm not at all like super like extreme knowledgeable of all the like every single trigger.

03:43:16.680 --> 03:43:23.680
So I've been looking up some stuff but I don't have the I don't have a lot of stuff to do this.

03:43:23.680 --> 03:43:29.680
The triggers but eventually I will get them and then I can do all the stuff.

03:43:29.680 --> 03:43:40.680
I have more triggers for you guys and I was more than just happy to use my voice and my praises and stuff.

03:43:40.680 --> 03:43:45.680
But since I can't really do all the extra sounds and stuff I got to be careful.

03:43:45.680 --> 03:43:50.680
So I need a little extra more other other stuff.

03:43:50.680 --> 03:43:51.680
I can still do praises.

03:43:51.680 --> 03:43:53.680
I can still do requests.

03:43:53.680 --> 03:43:55.680
I can still say stuff.

03:43:55.680 --> 03:44:01.680
But I have to be careful with noises.

03:44:01.680 --> 03:44:08.680
Scalp scratches.

03:44:08.680 --> 03:44:28.680
Scalp scratches.

03:44:28.680 --> 03:44:55.680
Scalp scratches.

03:44:55.680 --> 03:45:02.680
Scalp scratches.

03:45:02.680 --> 03:45:21.680
Scalp scratches.

03:45:21.680 --> 03:45:29.680
Scalp scratches.

03:45:29.680 --> 03:45:32.680
You have to also be careful with the breathing as well.

03:45:32.680 --> 03:45:37.680
I hate that too.

03:45:37.680 --> 03:45:40.680

03:51:05.700 --> 03:51:14.900

03:55:05.660 --> 03:55:08.660
Stop bullying me.

03:55:08.660 --> 03:55:11.660
My pancake was good.

03:55:11.660 --> 03:55:14.660
One day, I want to make you eat it.

Not that late.

I thought it was like super late.

03:57:04.660 --> 03:57:06.660
