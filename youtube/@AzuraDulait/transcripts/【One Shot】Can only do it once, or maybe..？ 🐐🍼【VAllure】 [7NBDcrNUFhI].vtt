07:46.680 --> 07:52.680
I'm already like in a little bit of pain so I took an electric bike

07:54.840 --> 07:58.840
To the to the store yeah

08:00.040 --> 08:02.040
To get to the store

08:07.720 --> 08:10.780
You guys you guys

08:10.780 --> 08:12.780
I

08:16.220 --> 08:20.540
I ate you I ate it I ate it I ate it hard

08:21.500 --> 08:23.500
I ate it

08:40.460 --> 08:46.620
I fell so hard my legs was twisted in between the bike

08:47.420 --> 08:54.300
I I was laying on the ground for like a minute that a bunch of people crowded around me to see if I was alive

09:03.020 --> 09:07.900
It was bad, but I'm fine. Don't worry. I'm fine now. Don't worry

09:17.580 --> 09:25.660
No, I didn't land on my face thankfully I put my hands out in front of me

09:26.380 --> 09:27.660
um

09:27.660 --> 09:29.660
I don't know what happened like

09:30.220 --> 09:33.740
the wheel like just went out of control and then

09:34.620 --> 09:37.180
Uh, I think I hit something because I felt a bump

09:38.060 --> 09:40.060
and the wheel just started like

09:40.860 --> 09:46.220
Wiggling out of control and no matter how much I turned the steering at the top

09:46.620 --> 09:48.620
To get it straight it wouldn't go straight

09:49.660 --> 09:51.660
And it was over. I knew it was over

09:54.620 --> 09:59.420
I I I bit my tongue and I just said oh well is that goodbye everybody

10:04.860 --> 10:06.860
And I and I fell I ate it

10:09.500 --> 10:11.500
Yeah

10:12.380 --> 10:20.940
Um, I hurt like my whole left side um pretty bad

10:23.580 --> 10:27.980
During that entire ASMR stream I was in a lot of pain

10:30.860 --> 10:34.700
Only one of you guys to worry so I was like I'll tell them tomorrow

10:36.140 --> 10:40.380
I'll tell them tomorrow. Stoney was like you should cancel stream

10:41.660 --> 10:44.940
No, that's fine. It's fine. Everything's okay

10:46.140 --> 10:48.620
So currently my leg is a little swollen

10:49.180 --> 10:52.460
I hit my shoulder my elbow

10:53.340 --> 10:57.660
And my all on my left side and my right but she kind of hurt

10:58.060 --> 11:00.060
I

11:06.860 --> 11:13.580
You died of embarrassment. No, I was fine. I was it's it's crazy because I expected people to laugh

11:14.060 --> 11:18.700
If someone would have started laughing then I'd probably be embarrassed, but no

11:19.420 --> 11:23.020
No one laughed. I think they were very concerned. I really think they thought I was

11:23.820 --> 11:25.820
Not a single person laughed

11:33.020 --> 11:37.420
So I have like ice on it right now. I've had ice on it since yesterday and

11:38.460 --> 11:41.020
And my whole body is so sore

11:43.180 --> 11:49.580
I think I like flipped I don't know. I think I like flipped I think I like flipped I think I like flipped

11:50.380 --> 11:56.380
I think I like flipped I don't even know how I ended up on my back because I fell forward

11:56.860 --> 12:01.260
So I think I flipped like I did a roller some side some type of something

12:01.740 --> 12:04.860
Because I fell forward with my hands out

12:05.500 --> 12:09.580
Slid on my hands and then somehow ended up on my back

12:11.580 --> 12:13.580
And I just laid there for a minute

12:19.900 --> 12:21.900
I

12:24.700 --> 12:29.820
Survive another to another day I'll live I'll be fine. It's nothing worse than

12:31.260 --> 12:33.260
Other incidents I had

12:34.300 --> 12:37.100
I had incidents where my finger got jammed in a

12:38.380 --> 12:40.380
In a safe

12:40.380 --> 12:42.060
Uh

12:42.060 --> 12:44.060
Was an accident

12:45.500 --> 12:47.500
Finger got slammed in it

12:48.460 --> 12:50.460
Big big heavy metal safe

12:51.260 --> 12:53.260
I split my finger

12:53.260 --> 12:54.620
Finger

12:54.620 --> 12:56.620
In two

12:57.340 --> 13:01.340
I've had worse injuries right that's that's fine that

13:02.060 --> 13:05.020
It was fine. It's perfectly fine

13:05.740 --> 13:09.020
I think that's one of the worst injuries I had

13:09.900 --> 13:12.780
Was the finger thing and I've had various others

13:13.660 --> 13:14.700
but

13:14.700 --> 13:15.740
so

13:15.820 --> 13:20.060
There was no need for me to go to a doctor. It's fine as long as the bruise didn't turn like

13:20.860 --> 13:22.620
Colors and

13:22.620 --> 13:25.420
And that would be fine if it was like black and blue

13:26.140 --> 13:29.660
Then maybe I would have maybe I would have to go see a doctor

13:29.820 --> 13:36.620
But the skin tone and everything nothing changed just a big giant bump with the little bruise on the top

13:40.220 --> 13:44.540
I got a little bump on my my forehead, but I'm very sure I didn't land on my head

13:45.500 --> 13:47.980
So maybe something hit me there, but I don't know

13:49.900 --> 13:51.900
But I'm fine

13:59.900 --> 14:03.340
Did I do a backflip? I think it was a front flip. I think that's what you call a front flip

14:09.180 --> 14:11.500
Maybe a backflip. I don't know. I don't remember

14:12.300 --> 14:14.860
I only remember making sure I didn't want to land on my head

14:15.660 --> 14:19.820
I had to protect my head at all costs. I did not have a helmet on so

14:21.420 --> 14:28.860
My my head was my main my head and neck was my main concern when I fell so I made sure to fall on the way I didn't land on my head

14:30.460 --> 14:36.380
So everyone remember to wear a helmet ride safely. It doesn't matter how slow you're going

14:37.420 --> 14:39.920
Wear a helmet wear a helmet

14:40.880 --> 14:46.080
It doesn't matter how slow you're going. You can move like a snail. It does not matter

14:56.800 --> 15:04.240
Stay safe. Do not do what I did. I was unsafe even though I know I can easily get injured. I was

15:07.040 --> 15:09.040
Don't do what I did

15:09.920 --> 15:11.920
I

15:22.000 --> 15:25.520
I'm good. Don't worry. I'm fine. Don't worry about me though. Okay. I'm fine

15:26.160 --> 15:30.320
I can laugh about it now. I was laughing about it then. I was literally laughing when I fell

15:31.440 --> 15:35.280
Everyone came over and they were like, are you okay? And I just gave them a thumbs up like

15:37.120 --> 15:39.120
Just a big old thumbs up

15:40.320 --> 15:42.320
I

15:43.840 --> 15:45.840
Always wear protection

15:46.640 --> 15:48.240
When riding a bike

15:48.240 --> 15:50.800
Yes, or riding any feel-good

15:51.680 --> 15:53.680
um that that doesn't

15:54.480 --> 15:57.120
Required you to be inside of it like a

15:58.000 --> 16:04.000
Even even then even inside of a like a race car. You still wear a helmet because you're going really fast

16:05.120 --> 16:07.120
Yeah

16:07.920 --> 16:09.920
Yeah

16:16.080 --> 16:20.560
No, don't be worried. I'm fine. I'm fine. I promise. I promise

16:21.600 --> 16:25.680
I'm just healing now. It's all that matters. It's a little bit of healing

16:26.800 --> 16:28.800
I took some pink color so

16:29.520 --> 16:31.520
Soon I will kick in and I'll be fine

16:31.840 --> 16:37.440
I just want to chat it up with you guys. I told you about what happened yesterday

16:41.040 --> 16:43.760
I wanted to stream a little longer

16:44.480 --> 16:46.480
Yesterday, but I was like

16:47.200 --> 16:49.200
I don't think I can keep going

16:49.520 --> 16:50.960
longer

16:50.960 --> 16:52.960
I need I need to rest

16:54.800 --> 16:57.200
So I didn't really say proper goodbyes yesterday

16:57.760 --> 17:01.440

22:34.080 --> 22:36.080
During the uh

22:38.160 --> 22:42.160
I am still new to the uh the audio stuff

22:43.360 --> 22:44.400
as um

22:44.400 --> 22:45.280
I

22:45.280 --> 22:48.880
I have been using really bad equipment a while back

22:49.440 --> 22:51.600
So I'm not used to the

22:52.320 --> 22:53.360
this

22:53.360 --> 22:57.120
equipment uh sharoni had helped me get um so

22:58.480 --> 23:00.480
I'm still learning how to use it

23:01.120 --> 23:07.440
And uh man sound has been helping with uh with it a lot uh so

23:08.320 --> 23:12.720
And now it's just up to me to really figure out how a majority of it work

23:13.440 --> 23:16.480
Since microphones are very different from each other

23:17.920 --> 23:21.040
Asmr microphone picks up everything

23:22.560 --> 23:26.720
Every single sound so I had a filter on it, but

23:28.000 --> 23:29.200
Uh

23:29.280 --> 23:31.280
It did not work

23:36.000 --> 23:40.160
I'll wear one I promise thank you. Thank you for the $4 don't know thank you. Thank you

23:47.440 --> 23:53.840
No worries your learning experience. Yes, please. I hope you'll have patience with me. I'm still learning

23:59.840 --> 24:01.840
I

24:03.520 --> 24:05.840
Can turn up this

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
What a helmet on your throne

24:24.560 --> 24:26.560
Okay, I will

24:27.520 --> 24:29.520
I'm gonna put a helmet on my throne

24:30.080 --> 24:32.080
I'll do it later

24:34.240 --> 24:39.120
I don't have a helmet which is crazy. I should have maybe gotten one but I don't have one

24:43.920 --> 24:45.920
Thank you for $2 don't know thank you

24:49.920 --> 24:51.920
I don't know the math

24:56.880 --> 24:58.880

Thank you

26:05.280 --> 26:07.280
No

26:26.880 --> 26:28.880
Oh

26:33.840 --> 26:41.440
Okay, what did I do? Oh, yeah, I was turning this up for you guys. I was so confused. What was I doing? Yeah

26:43.120 --> 26:47.040
Um it's here. You said you said you wanted it louder, right?

26:53.520 --> 26:55.520
I think that should be good

26:57.440 --> 26:59.440
If you need it louder, let me know

27:09.520 --> 27:12.020
Bye bye thanks for stopping by

27:19.520 --> 27:21.520
Um

27:22.400 --> 27:27.280
I'm like I'm like

27:38.080 --> 27:43.520
I opened something and I shouldn't have opened it. I don't know how to pronounce it. Oh, there we go. Yay

27:44.960 --> 27:49.280
I figured that out. Oh my gosh. Why was that so hard?

27:49.600 --> 27:52.720
It shouldn't have been that hard

27:58.480 --> 28:00.480
Yay

28:06.000 --> 28:10.160
All my boys suits are mine, grand. I'm very happy with those

28:17.200 --> 28:19.200
After

28:19.840 --> 28:21.840
I

28:25.680 --> 28:30.160
I'm so like unprepared I was so prepared but unprepared, you know

28:30.560 --> 28:34.160
You know how you have everything set up and you're like ready and you're like, I'm gonna do this

28:34.240 --> 28:36.240
I won't do that and then now you're just like

28:46.560 --> 28:48.240
Oh, yeah

28:48.320 --> 28:50.320
I also did want to mention that I uh

28:52.160 --> 28:55.360
Want to do more asmrs, but we're probably gonna have to

28:57.200 --> 29:01.360
Tone it down because our cookie eating was too much for youtube

29:02.240 --> 29:03.600
so

29:03.600 --> 29:05.760
We're gonna have to tone down the cookie eating

29:07.840 --> 29:09.840
And and stick to just some brushing

29:11.120 --> 29:14.240
some brazes and requests and stuff

29:14.320 --> 29:16.320
I

29:17.520 --> 29:21.360
And some milk pouring I like doing the milk pouring that was pretty fun

29:24.320 --> 29:28.720
We can test a few limits, but sadly

29:45.040 --> 29:47.040
All right

30:03.440 --> 30:05.440
Yes, I only say I agree

30:14.880 --> 30:16.880
Um

30:17.440 --> 30:20.720
We're gonna get started on the one shot

30:24.560 --> 30:26.560
I had a really good sleep

30:29.760 --> 30:32.160
Last last night, so I'm really like

30:37.040 --> 30:39.840
Still feeling the effects of the heart

30:44.240 --> 30:46.240
So

30:58.960 --> 31:00.960
Can you hear that is or is it too loud

31:10.240 --> 31:13.120
What does that sound you ask what is that sound

31:14.560 --> 31:19.120
Do you really want to know you want to know what that sound is?

31:38.640 --> 31:40.640
Yeah

31:40.880 --> 31:42.880
Do you want to know

31:47.280 --> 31:49.280
Well, that sound is

31:52.880 --> 31:54.880
One shot

31:58.800 --> 32:00.800
One shot

32:02.320 --> 32:04.320
The game is a block

32:11.360 --> 32:13.360

33:21.300 --> 33:25.300
Yes, yes. Yeah, one of my favourites.

33:25.300 --> 33:29.300
I never really think about a favourite game.

33:29.300 --> 33:33.300
I play it and I go, I like this.

33:33.300 --> 33:36.300
And then I move on.

33:36.300 --> 33:40.300
I like this. This is nice.

33:43.300 --> 33:46.300
I like this.

33:47.300 --> 33:52.300
Is this something you ate in school?

33:54.300 --> 33:58.300
Right.

I click start by accident, we're going,

34:59.040 --> 35:03.040
dedicated to our beloved friend Felix.

35:03.040 --> 35:05.040
Let me rest in peace.

35:09.040 --> 35:12.040
I'm not going to remember any of this, by the way.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.040
Arrows.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.040
Arrows.

35:27.040 --> 35:31.040
So it's only keyboard, no mouse.

35:34.040 --> 35:37.040
Examines z.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.040
Examines z.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.040
X to Council.

35:43.040 --> 35:45.040
Array.

35:45.040 --> 35:47.040
Walk faster, shift.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.040
A for Ming and Bra.

35:55.040 --> 35:57.040
S for M for Bra.

35:59.040 --> 36:01.040
S for C.

36:04.040 --> 36:07.040
I'm not going to remember any of this.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.040
Let's get started.

36:11.040 --> 36:15.040
Explore and interact with the environment and characters.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.040
Sometimes you may find an item.

36:17.040 --> 36:19.040
Once you have picked up an item,

36:19.040 --> 36:23.040
you may select it from your inventory.

36:23.040 --> 36:29.040
When the item is active, you can either combine it with other items in the inventory

36:29.040 --> 36:33.040
or use it at certain locations in order to progress.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.040
Array.

36:41.040 --> 36:47.040
I played this game like really really really really really long time ago.

36:47.040 --> 36:49.040
So I remember nothing.

36:51.040 --> 36:55.040
Maybe like some things here and there.

36:55.040 --> 36:59.040
Uh, I don't remember.

37:05.040 --> 37:07.040
A proven broad.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.040
Uh.

37:13.040 --> 37:27.040
Although full screen is an option, the game is best experienced in window mode.

37:27.040 --> 37:33.040
Really? How do you exit window mode? I mean how do you exit full screen mode?

37:37.040 --> 37:39.040
Oh.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.040
Oh.

37:41.040 --> 37:45.040
But it's so little I can't see.

37:47.040 --> 37:49.040
It's so little.

37:49.040 --> 37:51.040
It's so tiny.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.040
Glasses?

38:07.040 --> 38:09.040
I have glasses.

38:09.040 --> 38:11.040
I got reading glasses.

38:27.040 --> 38:29.040
No, it won't let you resize it.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.040
It's so tiny.

38:35.040 --> 38:37.040
It's so little.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.040
Small.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.040
I'm making it big and there's no way.

38:47.040 --> 38:49.040
There's no way I can see.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.040
Okay.

39:11.040 --> 39:13.040
I love the green man.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.040
The green man is a really good anime.

39:15.040 --> 39:17.040
One of my favorites actually.

39:17.040 --> 39:19.040
One of my favorites.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.040
I have many favorites.

39:31.040 --> 39:33.040
Okay.

39:33.040 --> 39:35.040
This is fine.

39:35.040 --> 39:39.040
I might try to move this over here.

39:39.040 --> 39:41.040
Oh, my shoulder.

39:49.040 --> 39:51.040
We're fine.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.040
Everything's fine.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.040
Hmm.

40:11.040 --> 40:13.040
Hello there.

40:13.040 --> 40:15.040
Hello?

40:17.040 --> 40:19.040
Hello there.

40:23.040 --> 40:25.040
Oh.

40:27.040 --> 40:29.040
I'm giving up.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.040
In what password?

40:33.040 --> 40:35.040
Access denied.

40:39.040 --> 40:41.040
Dusty books.

40:41.040 --> 40:43.040
That's too dark to read in here.

40:45.040 --> 40:49.040
The soft glowing light trickles through the window.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.040
What's this?

40:51.040 --> 40:53.040
It's even out here.

40:53.040 --> 40:55.040
Niko picks up the door.

40:55.040 --> 40:57.040
What's in here?

41:03.040 --> 41:05.040
Door's locked.

41:09.040 --> 41:11.040
Door's locked.

41:19.040 --> 41:21.040
Hiya.

41:23.040 --> 41:25.040
Oh, terrible.

41:25.040 --> 41:27.040
No.

41:31.040 --> 41:35.040
I don't know what we do at the senior level.

41:47.040 --> 41:49.040
Okay.

41:51.040 --> 41:53.040
What the?

41:53.040 --> 41:55.040
Hello?

41:55.040 --> 41:57.040
Hello?

41:57.040 --> 41:59.040
What do I do?

41:59.040 --> 42:01.040
Oh.

42:09.040 --> 42:11.040
The game sound is louder than my voice.

42:11.040 --> 42:13.040
I turn it down.

42:13.040 --> 42:15.040
Don't worry, I turn it down.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.040
I turn it down.

42:19.040 --> 42:21.040
Is that better?

42:21.040 --> 42:23.040
Is that better?

42:29.040 --> 42:31.040
I can turn myself up, actually.

42:31.040 --> 42:33.040
What am I always down there?

42:33.040 --> 42:35.040
What the fuck?

42:37.040 --> 42:39.040
How did that happen?

42:39.040 --> 42:41.040
Why am I always down there?

42:41.040 --> 42:43.040
Oh, there we go.

42:43.040 --> 42:45.040
Is that better?

42:45.040 --> 42:47.040
Let me know if I'm too loud, okay?

43:03.040 --> 43:05.040
Am I just...

43:07.040 --> 43:09.040
Am I just dumb?

43:15.040 --> 43:17.040
Am I just dumb?

43:25.040 --> 43:27.040
How do you use an item?

43:33.040 --> 43:35.040
How do you use an item?

43:35.040 --> 43:37.040
What?

43:39.040 --> 43:41.040
What?

43:45.040 --> 43:47.040
What?

43:53.040 --> 43:55.040
What? I don't...

43:55.040 --> 43:57.040
I don't understand.

43:57.040 --> 43:59.040
I woke up here.

44:11.040 --> 44:13.040
The door is locked.

44:15.040 --> 44:17.040
What?

44:19.040 --> 44:21.040
I don't remember.

44:25.040 --> 44:27.040
What do I do?

44:27.040 --> 44:29.040
Help me.

44:35.040 --> 44:37.040
Maybe something has to do with this window.

44:37.040 --> 44:39.040
Maybe I hold this in my hand.

44:39.040 --> 44:41.040
Or something.

44:41.040 --> 44:43.040
Ah!

44:43.040 --> 44:45.040
In the faint light,

44:45.040 --> 44:47.040
you can glimpse

44:47.040 --> 44:49.040
the face of the remote.

44:51.040 --> 44:53.040
Ah! All of our numbers accept.

44:57.040 --> 44:59.040
Zero, six, three.

44:59.040 --> 45:01.040
Seven are missing.

45:03.040 --> 45:05.040
Zero, six, three.

45:11.040 --> 45:13.040
Zero.

45:23.040 --> 45:25.040
No.

45:37.040 --> 45:39.040
This is six, this is three, yeah?

45:41.040 --> 45:43.040
X is granted.

45:47.040 --> 45:49.040
Okay. Ah, computer.

45:49.040 --> 45:51.040
I'm in.

45:51.040 --> 45:53.040
Let's go!

45:53.040 --> 45:55.040
Okay.

45:55.040 --> 45:57.040
You found me.

45:57.040 --> 45:59.040
Why?

46:01.040 --> 46:03.040
You're already too late.

46:03.040 --> 46:05.040
Not much of the world remains.

46:07.040 --> 46:09.040
This will be apparent once you go outside.

46:11.040 --> 46:13.040
This place was never worth saving.

46:15.040 --> 46:17.040
Do you still want to try?

46:19.040 --> 46:21.040
I remember this.

46:21.040 --> 46:25.040
Your actions here will affect Miko.

46:25.040 --> 46:27.040
You talking to me?

46:29.040 --> 46:31.040
You talking to me?

46:33.040 --> 46:35.040
Your mission is to help Miko leave.

46:37.040 --> 46:39.040
And most importantly,

46:39.040 --> 46:41.040
Oh!

46:47.040 --> 46:49.040
You only have one shot.

46:51.040 --> 46:53.040
Azura.

46:57.040 --> 46:59.040
This will be so fun.

46:59.040 --> 47:01.040
If I was on like

47:01.040 --> 47:03.040
display,

47:03.040 --> 47:05.040
I'll show you my monitor.

47:09.040 --> 47:13.040
And you guys can see the little things pop up too.

47:27.040 --> 47:29.040
It makes it small windowed again.

47:31.040 --> 47:33.040
No, I gotta make it big.

47:33.040 --> 47:35.040
Here we go.

47:39.040 --> 47:41.040
Miko, here's the sound of a door unlocking.

47:55.040 --> 47:57.040
A weathered plant sits here,

47:57.040 --> 47:59.040
stiff and dry.

47:59.040 --> 48:01.040
A branch snaps off.

48:01.040 --> 48:03.040
A branch.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.040
It's me! It's me, I'm Miko.

48:05.040 --> 48:07.040
I'm Miko.

48:07.040 --> 48:09.040

48:15.040 --> 48:17.040
Miko, Miko

48:17.040 --> 48:19.040
A pair of luminous yellow eyes stare back at Miko.

48:23.040 --> 48:25.040
There's no water in the toilet.

48:25.040 --> 48:27.040
Are you gonna take a poop ball?

48:29.040 --> 48:31.040
Let's help won't run.

What's this?

52:36.840 --> 52:44.840
What's this?

52:44.840 --> 53:01.840
Stairs.

53:01.840 --> 53:07.840
Very long stairs.

53:07.840 --> 53:14.840
It's a light bulb.

53:14.840 --> 53:24.840
You can fill the empty bottle with milk.

53:24.840 --> 53:32.840
It's a light bulb.

53:33.840 --> 53:47.840
Flashbang!

53:47.840 --> 54:07.840
I have a sensitivity to light.

54:07.840 --> 54:17.840
My poor eye.

54:17.840 --> 54:37.840
Yeah, we're fine.

54:37.840 --> 54:54.840
I'm gonna have to use some eye drops later.

54:54.840 --> 55:06.840
I have a light bulb.

55:06.840 --> 55:35.840
The urge to break it is real.

55:35.840 --> 55:49.840
It's left of a computer terminal.

55:49.840 --> 55:58.840
What in here?

55:58.840 --> 56:07.840
I might have to dim the brightness.

56:07.840 --> 56:14.840
You can quickly travel to the locations you have already visited by selecting the fast travel option in the menu.

56:14.840 --> 56:17.840
You wanna know something funny?

56:17.840 --> 56:21.840
When I played this game the first time, I didn't know there was a fast travel option.

56:21.840 --> 56:27.840
Did you know I walked everywhere on foot?

56:27.840 --> 56:31.840
That's the only thing I remember from this game.

56:31.840 --> 56:39.840
I walked everywhere on foot.

56:39.840 --> 56:47.840
The default key for opening the menu is A.

56:47.840 --> 56:50.840
I didn't mind it.

56:50.840 --> 56:55.840
I like the slight realism of just walking everywhere.

56:55.840 --> 57:02.840
It was fun.

57:02.840 --> 57:05.840
It wasn't. It wasn't added there in the start. It's new.

57:05.840 --> 57:08.840
Well, that makes sense.

57:08.840 --> 57:13.840
That makes sense.

57:13.840 --> 57:20.840
I played it when there wasn't a fast travel then because I walked everywhere.

57:20.840 --> 57:24.840
It was fun though.

57:24.840 --> 57:29.840
I remember getting lost in this place. A robot.

57:29.840 --> 57:40.840
And no longer has power.

57:40.840 --> 58:01.840
There's a robot left.

58:01.840 --> 58:07.840
There's a robot left.

58:07.840 --> 58:17.840
I don't like long walks.

58:17.840 --> 58:21.840
I don't know why that scared me, but it did.

58:21.840 --> 58:32.840
There's a robot left.

58:32.840 --> 58:42.840
I don't know why that scared me.

58:42.840 --> 58:52.840
I don't know why that scared me.

58:53.840 --> 58:58.840
Thanks.

58:58.840 --> 59:02.840
Sorry. I'm a little lost.

59:02.840 --> 59:07.840
Alright. Allow me to explain some things.

59:07.840 --> 59:10.840
May I first ask how you arrived here?

59:10.840 --> 59:14.840
I'm not sure.

59:14.840 --> 59:19.840
I woke up in this weird house.

59:19.840 --> 59:23.840
It was really dark.

59:23.840 --> 59:30.840
So you woke up in an unfamiliar dark location?

59:30.840 --> 59:34.840
Just as my prophecy foretold, yes.

59:34.840 --> 59:38.840
You are the savior we have been waiting for.

59:38.840 --> 59:46.840
You will be the one to save our world from internal darkness.

59:46.840 --> 59:50.840
I will now provide you with vital information.

59:50.840 --> 59:53.840
Please ask me anything.

59:53.840 --> 01:00:00.840
Well, can you tell me about this world?

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.840
I'm not sure where I am exactly.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:08.840
I can't see too far off everything so dark.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:15.840
Our world was not always this dim.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.840
Tomorrow was it so broken.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:24.840
But time waits for nobody, not even saviors.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.840
The world is divided into three regions.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:32.840
You are on the fringe right now, the barons.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:48.840
The tower you see in the distance once held our sun.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.840
Oh, so that's what the tall thing was?

01:00:52.840 --> 01:01:01.840
As you go further toward the center, you will cross the other regions.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:04.840
There should be a map still.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.840
And this outpost somewhere.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:14.840
Oh, can you tell me about the label?

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:19.840
I found it in the house I woke up in.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.840
But then your hands is our new sun.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.840
Bro, I can't read your sun.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:35.840
It's child. He's holding his child.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:41.840
Yes, years ago, our previous sun set atop that tower

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.840
and spilled its life into the land.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.840
But one day, the light went out.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:53.840
Oh.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.840
The world is still hanging on by a thread.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:05.840
The surface of this world is abundant with an element called phosphor.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:14.840
Fortunately for us, this element stored light, energy from our previous sun.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.840
It's now our only source of illumination.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:28.840
But its energy is...

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:32.840
Vinnit! Vinnit! Find it!

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:41.840
Find it! Find it! Find it! Find it! Find it! Find it!

01:02:41.840 --> 01:03:11.840
ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ�

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:13.840
Good night.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.840
Sleep well.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:20.840
When the last of the light dies, our world will too.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.840
Ah.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:30.840
But now that you are here, with the new sun, all is well.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:34.840
You will need to restore it to the power.

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:39.840
That looks pretty far off.

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.840
Yes.

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:47.840
So begins your pilgrimage.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.840
Also, the sun is fragile.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.840
So be careful.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:04:00.840
If the sun shatters, the world will end in an instant.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.840
Oh.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:06.840
Can you tell me about a computer?

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:13.840
In the house, I found this computer.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:19.840
It kept saying stuff like, your actions here will affect Niko.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:23.840
But I'm Niko.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.840
I'm Niko. I'm Niko.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:29.840
Yes, you are Niko.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.840
Are those messages meant for someone else?

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.840
Hmm.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:42.840
If I had to guess, they might be trying to pass the message to Azura.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.840
It's me!

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.840
It's me!

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:52.840
Azura!

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:57.840
It's me!

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:00.840
Azura?

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.840
That would be our god.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.840
I'm your god.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.840
Your goddess.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.840
Azura.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.840
Dule.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:26.840
If you are here, that means Azura is here also.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:30.840
Azura will provide guidance for your journey.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:35.840
In fact, they already have.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.840
Really?

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:41.840
I haven't seen anyone else, anyone though.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:47.840
Have you not contacted Azura yet?

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.840
I don't think so.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:55.840
Being the bringer of our sun, you have the sacred ability to communicate directly with Azura.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:01.840
Ah, an ability that no one else possesses.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.840
Certainly not I.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:07.840
Hmm? Hmm?

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:12.840
Please close your eyes and focus.

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:15.840
Alright.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:24.840
Hello? Azura? Are you there?

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:30.840
Yes, I am.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:36.840
Oh, nice to meet you, Azura.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.840
My name is Niko.

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:42.840
I see you too, Niko. You are so cute.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:47.840
That's horrible.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.840
I actually heard someone.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:58.840
They said their name is Azura.

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.840
This is incredible.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:05.840
Do not be afraid to ask Azura for assistance.

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:10.840
You are a messiah after all.

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:15.840
Can you tell me about going home?

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:21.840
Home. I don't mean to be rude, but I'm not sure about this.

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.840
I still don't know how I got here.

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:27.840
I was just with my mama a few hours ago.

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:38.840
And now it feels like I'm in a bad dream.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:42.840
I just want to go home.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:45.840
Your mission is to save our world.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:50.840
Just as my mission is to tell you about our world,

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.840
I'm unable to help you beyond my programming.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.840
I'm sorry.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:01.840
Oh.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.840
I think that's all I have to ask for now.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.840
Excellent.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.840
I wish you luck.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.840
Going on here?

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.840
It's in there.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:17.840
A robot without power.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.840
Dusty shells.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.840
Where does the shell splutter?

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:29.840
The use of a robot as our placement had engineer seems unorthodox.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:34.840
Especially the one responsible for the last year's incident.

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:39.840
I suppose they had to get her away from the city.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:44.840
But that doesn't make it easier to swallow for those of us who worked here.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.840
I hope that man knows what he's doing.

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:49.840
Management.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.840
Dusty shells.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.840
Where does the shell?

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.840
Where does the shell?

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.840
The faded poster.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.840
Reminder to all workers,

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:12.840
the rarest form of blue phosphor is found during the fall.

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.840
The rarest form of blue phosphor is found during the fall.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:21.840
The rarest form of blue phosphor is found during the phosphor shrimp spawn.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.840
Period.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:31.840
If you observe a pond with a bubbled over surface, please contact management immediately.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:34.840
We will dispatch to harvest team ASAP.

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:40.840
ASAP. ASAP. ASAP. ASAP.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.840
It's a faded poster.

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:47.840
Five new positions available at the mine.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:52.840
Housing, other provisions are included upon hiring.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.840
First come, first serve.

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:59.840
I keep freaking out at run.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:02.840
Run.

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:07.840
Robot. It seems to be okay. Just doesn't have power.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:11.840
Dusty shells. Dusty shells.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.840
It won't turn on.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:33.840
Mama Zura is doing well. Don't worry about me.

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.840
Hope you're all doing well and welcoming those who just came in.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.840
Welcome, welcome.

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.840
Self-charging solar battery model.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:48.840
N87. One year warranty included.

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:59.840
Simply place your self-charging battery in full daylight with the lens facing up.

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.840
Charges in seconds. No external powers needed.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.840
Troubleshooting manual.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:15.840
If the battery fails to charge, check to see if the lens on the front side has been dislodged during transport.

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.840
One charge cycle will last about 10 days.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:27.840
If you notice a decline in the charge cycle within the warranty period, please contact the manufacturer.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:30.840
This box looks interesting.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:33.840
I wish I had something to pry it open with.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:48.840
A robot may not injure a living person, or through an action, allow a person to come to harm.

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:59.840
A robot must obey the orders given to it by people, except where such orders would conflict with the first law.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:10.840
A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.840
The world.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.840
We're in the bare hands.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:19.840
Then inside is the glen.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:22.840
And then the refuge.

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:25.840
And then the tower in the center.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.840
How open? Do I have anything?

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:39.840
Oh, a bottle can open it.

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:48.840
Robot without power.

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:01.840
Paper with faded ink.

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:10.840
Able to provide power to all robots and machinery in an area via a large electromagnetic field.

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:15.840
Maintenance efforts are quite high as expected.

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:24.840
We have provided customized backup cells for the few most important robots.

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:31.840
Their electromagnetic fields are much weaker, and the signals are high specific.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:34.840
Highly supposed to be a good amount.

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:45.840
In other words, these small cells can only charge one single.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.840
Ah.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.840
It's a sort of small machine. I wonder what it does.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:56.840
I can feel my hair standing up a little.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:04.840
There's a lot of small goings from swimming in the bottle.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.840
Can I use it?

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.840
That's a big machine.

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.840
Those seem to be doing anything though.

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.840
It's a rectangular shape hole in the middle.

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.840
Like something you use to fit in here.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:33.840
How do you use items?

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.840
Hmm.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:49.840
Don't walk me walk.

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.840
Do I have to look for something?

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.840
Am I missing something?

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.840
I don't know.

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:45.840
It's over here.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.840
I was going to leave it on spooky in here.

01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:00.840
A robot sitting on a conveyor belt doesn't seem enough power.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:06.840
Robot? It seems to be okay. Just enough power.

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:17.840
You imagine equal trips on a pebble,

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:20.840
and the orb shotters would be catastrophic.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.840
Did she get it?

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.840
Catastrophic.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.840
Catastrophic.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.840
Catastrophic.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.840
Catastrophic.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.840
A big machine.

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.840
Looks to be used to crush metal.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.840
It's barely damaged.

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.840
A robot's arm.

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.840
A robot's arm.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.840
A robot's arm.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.840
A robot's arm.

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.840
A robot's arm.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.840
A robot's arm.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.840
Why would you want to smash a bottle here, Ezra?

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.840
The shots could get anywhere.

... so the vent zone, barren workers was still recommended to wear gas masks.

01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:55.820
This mask would mandatory around active vent sites of course. As more and more of the workforce got

01:19:55.820 --> 01:20:03.500
replaced by robots, we found ourselves with the surplus of abandoned gas masks. It seemed like

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:09.500
like a waste to get rid of them all, so we kept a few for our emergencies.

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:14.500
I don't know where I got our, my brain just inserted the word.

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:37.500
Wait, there's a note over there.

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:44.500
I don't see the note. How do I get that note?

01:20:44.500 --> 01:21:00.500
Oh, a middle safe. It seems like it's locked with a six digit code.

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:05.500
I don't remember seeing any six digit codes to use or up.

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:12.500
No, that wasn't it.

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.500
This way.

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:32.500
Let me have a six line, six line, six line.

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:37.500
I'm not evil. I'm innocent.

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:44.500
The sun will not return and the abyss is calling my name.

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:50.500
I'm sorry everyone for choosing to leave before the darkness of the case is all.

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.500
Yikes.

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:12.500
Oh, this is where I was going to go anyway.

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.500
What's up there?

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:26.500
I don't think I should be here.

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:31.500
So we will not go there.

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:41.500
Wait, what's that? Was I there?

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:44.500
Did I go this way?

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.500
What's another note?

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:55.500
I turn page with faded inks.

01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.500
X, X, X, X.

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:03.500
With the mining operation going smoothly,

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:07.500
materials are no longer a limiting factor.

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:15.500
We will be able to build more resilient robots, both in body and mind.

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:28.500
Specifically, the discovery of metal alloy 291 will likely allow the development of highly efficient circuitry.

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:30.500
Cool.

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:32.500
Are these just rocks?

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:37.500
Can I like jump?

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:49.500
It's okay to be scared of the dark. Don't worry.

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.500
It's a robot.

01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:54.500
A robot with no power, just like the rest.

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:18.500
It's a house.

01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:23.500
Oh, the light bulb.

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:27.500
So are you the Messiah?

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.500
That's what I've been told.

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:33.500
I expected someone taller.

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:35.500
Vrulda? Vrulda?

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:37.500
I can get big for you, alright?

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.500
I'll get nice and big.

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:45.500
Or at least someone that doesn't look like a kitten.

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:48.500
Leave me alone, you bully.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.500
Leave me alone.

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:54.500
He's still growing.

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:57.500
Love you guys on mine, I'm gonna eat a snack.

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:09.500
And that's what you are, right?

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:12.500
Some sort of cat.

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:14.500
Vrulda?

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.500
No.

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.500
I'm a person.

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:23.500
That's right, you tell him, Niko.

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:25.500
You're a person.

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:29.500
You got the eyes of a cat.

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:33.500
But cats walk on four legs.

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.500
Well, either way.

01:25:56.500 --> 01:26:01.500
A child like you being the Messiah just doesn't feel right.

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:06.500
But that robot back there said there's no mistake.

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.500
I know.

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:18.500
This is going to be, this is going to sound cold, but

01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:23.500
I honestly think you're better off just leaving

01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:26.500
and letting the world die naturally.

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:29.500
Wow, no.

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:35.500
What a downer, man, mama.

01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:42.500
You go party, Popar.

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.500
The world has its bones.

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:48.500
Wow, I don't know what happened.

01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:51.500
But English just decided not to work with me.

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:57.500
The world has been falling apart for a long time.

01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:03.500
This manner of decay is highly unprobable.

01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:07.500
Probable that the sun can fix it.

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:10.500
It doesn't hurt to try.

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.500
Jesus.

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:16.500
You've already seen how bad it can get, right?

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:19.500
They haven't seen much of anything, actually.

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:22.500
And you can't really just leave.

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:25.500
Oh, so you just got here.

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:28.500
Then you must be headed towards the tower.

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.500
Mm-hmm.

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.500
It's where I'm supposed to put the light bulb.

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:36.500
Or sun, isn't it?

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:38.500
Yeah, at the very top.

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:41.500
We know that the tower contains a force

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:44.500
that nobody could comprehend.

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:47.500
And the power is strongest at the summit.

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:51.500
Maybe it will send you back home after you complete your mission.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.500
Oh?

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:55.500
Don't take my word for it, though.

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:18.500
This is definitely not Dark Souls.

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:24.500
Mm-hmm.

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.500
It went up.

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:28.500
Mm-hmm.

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.500
Mm-hmm.

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:53.500
Just leave the world before it's in our time.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.500
Ah, wrong button.

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:31.500
A glass is a bit too foggy to see details, though.

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:40.500
A shelf of weird tools and a piece of metal.

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:42.500
Still silver.

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:44.500
I heard the news about the mines.

01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:47.500
I'm sorry, I can't imagine what you're feeling.

01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.500
It's been two weeks.

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:51.500
I know it must be hard.

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:54.500
But maybe it's better that you come back.

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:57.500
It's only a matter of time before the roll.

01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.500
Robots.

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:02.500
That's right. Robots.

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:05.500
What a cute misspell.

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.500
Are we called?

01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:11.500
At least let me know you got my message, okay?

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.500
Kip.

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:16.500
Something is poking out of the shelf.

01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:18.500
Ah, the screwdriver.

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.500
You can take it if you want.

01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:21.500
It may help you.

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.500
Oh, are you sure?

01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:25.500
Yes, I have many.

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.500
Thank you.

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:33.500
A shelf of weird tools and a piece of metal.

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:35.500
Please don't touch that.

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:37.500
Oh, sorry, I got curious.

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:39.500
What is this thing?

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.500
Back-up power cell.

01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:43.500
It keeps me functional.

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:50.500
The main generator for the barons ran out of power some time ago.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:53.500
It could not even last a week without the sun.

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:55.500
Sorry to hear that.

01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:01.500
All we can do is make use of the light we have.

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:11.500
It's a metal chess table covered in dust.

01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:15.500
I have, oh my god.

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:22.500
Water time. Water break.

01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:26.500
Oh.

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:33.500
Having a swollen esophagus really sucks.

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:44.500
I haven't played chess with anyone else for a very long time.

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.500
Ahem.

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:52.500
Oh?

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:56.500
Not even with the other robots?

01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:58.500
No.

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:03.500
Nobody in the barons have that capacity in their programming.

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:07.500
Nobody here is tamed for that matter.

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:10.500
What is tamed? I remember.

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:16.500
Talk to me.

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:18.500
What's inside the tower?

01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:22.500
I don't know. Nobody's ever entered it before.

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:26.500
At least nobody.

01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.500
Nobody history knows.

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:32.500
Nobody history knows.

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:36.500
Nobody history knows.

01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:39.500
Nobody history knows.

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:47.500
Nobody history knows.

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.500
Moving on.

01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.500
Then who built it?

01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.500
Built?

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:03.500
As far as anyone can tell, it's been there since the beginning of time.

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:10.500
I know someone who wanted to study it before, but...

01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:13.500
Oh?

01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:16.500
He never told me if it went anywhere.

01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:26.500
Do you need further assistance?

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.500
We're good, thanks.

01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:30.500
Huh?

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.500
Hmm.

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:43.500
I don't know.

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:50.500
Am I supposed to be this way?

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:56.500
Wait.

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:02.500
I saw you heading towards this direction.

01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:05.500
The Mayans have been abandoned for a long time.

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:08.500
I can't not guarantee that it's safe.

01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:13.500
If you must enter it, it's my duty to accompany you at least.

01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:15.500
Oh, thanks.

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.500
They're so fast.

01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.500
It's cool.

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:25.500
Do be careful in here.

01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:29.500
There's a little gadget on the ground.

01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.500
Looks kinda like a camera.

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:33.500
But it's left of a camera anyway.

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:36.500
Probably even part of a robot at one point.

01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:39.500
Oh? Or not? I don't know.

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.500
Can I go this way?

01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:49.500
I see a faint yellow glow in the distance.

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:52.500
I'll stand so close to the edge.

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:54.500
Sorry.

01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:58.500
Looks like even the entrance tunnel collapsed.

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:02.500
Without a vehicle, we can't foresee it.

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:04.500
Can we walk? I can.

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:07.500
But for you, it's a safety violation.

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.500
I won't allow it.

01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.500
What's ahead anyway?

01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:15.500
It's a huge network of underground lines that source

01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:20.500
a source of this world's metal and non-phosphor fuel.

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:25.500
This is what propelled the world into industrial age.

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:29.500
So now it's lost forever.

01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:31.500
It's been for a while now.

01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:34.500
When the sun went out, the mines were the first to be abandoned

01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:37.500
and missed initial panic.

01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:41.500
Even the robots have been all cleared out and repurposed.

01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.500
That makes sense.

01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:49.500
It's like how you can say history, forgot someone,

01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:52.500
an event if the records of it are lost.

01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:54.500
Oh!

01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:57.500
I've never heard anyone say it like that before,

01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:00.500
so it's good to know now.

01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:04.500
Those are definitely words.

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:06.500
Yeah.

01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:12.500
No, there was one that always insist on going back.

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.500
No?

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:16.500
I'll be okay.

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:20.500
You know, when you read a word or a sentence or something

01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:23.500
and it just doesn't sound right, no matter how you say it,

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:28.500
or like when you spell out a word and you're spelling it correctly,

01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:31.500
but it just doesn't look right.

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:35.500
It's like you finally looked at the word and actually looked at it

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:38.500
and it still doesn't look right.

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:42.500
That's what that felt like right then and there.

01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:04.500
They have kind of uncanny valley of grammar.

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:06.500
I think that's it.

01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:08.500
Oh, there's anything else in here.

01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:10.500
We'll leave.

01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:12.500
Ready to leave?

01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:14.500
Mm-hmm.

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.500
Mm.

01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:24.500
All right.

01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:31.500
Mm-hmm.

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:51.500
Mm-hmm.

01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:54.500
Oh yeah, I forgot I got fast travel.

01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.500
I was going to walk all the way back.

01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:01.500
How do you fast travel again?

01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:18.500
Which one is it?

01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:22.500
I don't remember.

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:26.500
Aha!

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:28.500
It was good.

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:30.500
Are you the one?

01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:40.500
Wait.

01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:42.500
You have this screwdriver.

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:44.500
I can open up the box.

01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:50.500
Hello again.

01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:52.500
Are there more questions you wish to ask?

01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:54.500
No.

01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:56.500
It's all right. Thank you.

01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:58.500
I'm not kidding. I wish you safe travels.

01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:21.500
The screwdriver is not nearly big enough to pry it open.

01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:23.500
Come on.

01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.500
Come on. It's open.

01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:47.500
I'm feeling I'm missing something.

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:53.500
What would you need the screwdriver for?

01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:19.500
I forgot I can run as well.

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.500
I'm slow walking.

01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:47.500
What if my scarf got caught in there

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:49.500
and then it'll pull me in

01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:51.500
and not going to finish that sentence?

01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.500
That's the...

01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:59.500
That's a horrible thought.

01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:03.500
A big machine.

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.500
What do you use the machine for?

01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:13.500
What can I use the screwdriver for?

01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.500
I'm not forgetting something.

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.500
Am I forgetting something?

01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:27.500
I feel I am forgetting something.

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:49.500
Is there anything in here?

01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:11.500
Anything up here?

01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:19.500
I don't know.

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:49.500
What is this?

01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:51.500
A metal pipe.

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:53.500
It must have broken out from one of these terminals.

01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:57.500
It's not bad.

01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.500
I'm a little tired from walking.

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.500
It's all right if I take a nap.

01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:05.500
It's all right if I take a nap.

01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:07.500
It's all right if I take a nap.

01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:09.500
It's all right if I take a nap.

01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:11.500
It's all right if I take a nap.

01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:13.500
It's all right if I take a nap.

01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:15.500
It's all right if I take a nap.

01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:17.500
It's all right if I take a nap.

01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.500
Sure.

01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:21.500
A little nappy.

01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:23.500
Nappy for Nico.

01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:43.500
Hello?

01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:45.500
L goodbye?

01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:48.500
Hello?

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:52.500
Hello?

01:43:54.500 --> 01:43:56.500
Did I break the game?

01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:58.500
Did I break the game?

01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:01.500
What happened?

01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:05.700
What happened?

01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:07.500
What happened?

You're so cute!

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:25.280
Azura, are you still there?

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:29.280
Yes.

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:32.280
I'm awake.

01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:34.280
I had a dream just now.

01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:36.280
I saw it.

01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:37.280
You did?

01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:39.280
Wow.

01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:41.280
I...

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:43.280
I really thought I was back home.

01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:50.280
Oh, the sun back in my home world is in a light bulb.

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:53.280
There's a big ball of fire in the sky.

01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:56.280
I don't...

01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:59.280
I don't think I would be able to hold it

01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:03.280
like I do with the sun for your world.

01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:05.280
This isn't my world.

01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:07.280
Huh?

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:10.280
This isn't the world I live in.

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.280
Really?

01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:14.280
I guess not.

01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:21.280
If you're the god of this world,

01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:24.280
you wouldn't necessarily be in it.

01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:27.280
What's your home world called?

01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:31.280
Earth.

01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:36.280
Earth.

01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:39.280
Earth.

01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:44.280
Like, the stuff on the ground.

01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:48.280
Why is he so cute?

01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:54.280
I want to squish him.

01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:56.280
I want to squish him.

01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:00.280
Squish.

01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:06.280
Wait.

01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:08.280
Do you live on the ground?

01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:10.280
No, silly.

01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.280
No.

01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:16.280
Ah,

01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:18.280
neither do we.

01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:23.280
Bustros and field mice and stuff too.

01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:26.280
Does your world have a sun?

01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:31.280
Yes.

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:33.280
It's also a ball of fire.

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:35.280
Really?

01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:36.280
Wow.

01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:39.280
Can you hold it?

01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:44.280
That was a silly question, wasn't it?

01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:47.280
It's okay, baby.

01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:48.280
It's okay.

01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:51.280
No silly question.

01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:55.280
Actually, little nickel.

01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:05.280
The sun in my home world is very bright.

01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:07.280
Warm too.

01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:09.280
You saw, right?

01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:12.280
But it goes away sometimes at night.

01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:14.280
Everything gets dark.

01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:17.280
Kind of like how this world is now.

01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:21.280
But it's okay because sun always comes back the next day.

01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:24.280
That's good, won't you think?

01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:27.280
My world is like that too.

01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:29.280
Ah.

01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:32.280
Do you sleep during the night?

01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:34.280
We go to sleep usually.

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:38.280
I sometimes sleep.

01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:43.280
I have a hard time sleeping a little bit of insomnia.

01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:50.280
So I have to take my medication that usually puts me to sleep.

01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:52.280
But sometimes it doesn't work.

01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:56.280
And I'll be up for hours before falling asleep around like 6 in the morning.

01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:00.280
Sleep is very hard.

01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:06.280
That's why I was surprised to have extremely good sleep last night.

01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.280
I went to sleep pretty early.

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:10.280
It was really good.

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:12.280
I think I was snoring.

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:16.280
I usually do not snore, but I feel like I did.

01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:18.280
I woke up drooling.

01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:20.280
It was like all over my arm.

01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:31.280
I don't have to explain what they are.

01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:32.280
Do I?

01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:35.280
Did I miss something?

01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:38.280
There's a bunch of them in this world.

01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:39.280
A bunch of what?

01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:40.280
Did I miss something?

01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:50.280
Anyway, you should probably get going.

01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:57.280
Do you have some shams?

01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:59.280
I think I'll sit here.

01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:05.280
Oh, computers? You're talking about computers?

01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:08.280
Let's see.

01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:20.280
There's something in the air here.

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:22.280
It hurts to breathe.

01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:49.280
I have a lot.

01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:15.280
The pipe won't fit under the cracks.

01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:17.280
We need to flatten it.

01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:21.280
I know. I know how.

01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:24.280
We can flatten it. Let's go flatten it.

01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:27.280
Big scary machine.

01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:37.280
Do you want me to crush the pipe in here, Azora?

01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:40.280
I don't want to get too close.

01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:43.280
That was scary.

01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:46.280
I was scared for you. Don't worry.

01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:49.280
I wouldn't be near this at all.

01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:53.280
Good night.

01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:55.280
Good night.

01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:56.280
Good girl.

01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:57.280
We're being here.

01:51:57.280 --> 01:51:58.280
Stopping by.

01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:00.280
Hello.

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:02.280
9-9.

01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:06.280
We're in the way.

01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:07.280
Hello.

01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:10.280
It's turning my way.

01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:14.280
This bus looks interesting.

01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:16.280
Wait, I wasn't holding it.

01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:19.280
I have a crowbar now.

01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:23.280
Wait, did I not click on it?

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:27.280
This bar should open it.

01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:31.280
This little mill cube and some broken glass in here

01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:33.280
looks like what I used

01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:35.280
to be

01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:37.280
what used to be a machine bar.

01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:40.280
Wow, my English is just so horrendous.

01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:45.280
It says solar battery on the side.

01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:53.280
You screwed right up the lens out?

01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:54.280
Okay.

01:52:58.280 --> 01:52:59.280
The lens pops right in.

01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:01.280
Broken battery.

01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:04.280
Boom, boom, boom.

01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:05.280
Let's go.

01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:14.280
It's like my hand.

01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:19.280
Empty.

01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:22.280
We're using the sun directly on the battery?

01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:23.280
Yes.

01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:26.280
I would have never thought of that.

01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:28.280
Good thinking, Azura.

01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:29.280
I'm smart.

01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:34.280
It looks like it's already fully charged.

01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:35.280
That was fast.

01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:44.280
Let's hope the charge battery does something.

01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:51.280
Oh, my eyes.

01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:52.280
It was.

01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:01.280
It wasn't even that bright.

01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:13.280
Oh, I wasn't sneezing.

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:14.280
Sorry.

01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:15.280
I wasn't sneezing.

01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:16.280
I didn't sneeze.

01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:19.280
I wasn't sneezing.

01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:22.280
Oh, thank you.

01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:23.280
Thank you.

01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:36.280
Ow.

01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:37.280
I just got shot.

01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:40.280
Oh, you're not getting out of the tube, man.

01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:45.280
Shot, not fun.

01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:47.280
Robots are right.

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:48.280
I am functional.

01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:50.280
Did you power the generator?

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:52.280
I, I guess we did.

01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:53.280
Right, Azura?

01:54:57.280 --> 01:54:58.280
I am functional.

01:54:58.280 --> 01:54:59.280
I can walk.

01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:02.280
Congratulations.

01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:16.280
I see you.

01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:21.280
I see you've made progress in the world, Azura.

01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:23.280
Oh, I didn't mean click, click, click.

01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:25.280
Oh, no, I don't know what it said.

01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:29.280
I believe you need a code to unlock certain bots.

01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:33.280
Well, the code no longer exists in this world.

01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:38.280
Do you understand what that means, Azura?

01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:41.280
Yes.

01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:42.280
Good.

01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:43.280
Start looking.

01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:44.280
All right.

01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:00.280
I think

01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:05.280
if I remember correctly,

01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:10.280
I go here, then here,

01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:13.280
browse local files.

01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:17.280
Ah,

01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:19.280
read me.

01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:24.280
No, not here.

01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:29.280
Uh,

01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:35.280
but,

01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:36.280
but,

01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:40.280
I don't,

01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:51.280
I don't remember.

01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:02.280
Oh, no, that's, that's the game, right?

01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:07.280
Oh.

01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:12.280
What do I do?

01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:14.280
I'm scared.

01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:22.280
I'm actually frightened.

01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:23.280
Oh.

01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:25.280
Oh.

01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:36.280
Oh.

01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:59.280
What the heck is this?

01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:02.280
I,

01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:06.280
I don't know.

01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:23.280
Oh, I found it.

01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:27.280
Oh, no, I exited.

01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:31.280
I found it.

01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:32.280
I'm smart.

01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:33.280
I'm intelligent.

01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:36.280
I'm smart.

01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:52.280
Where was the box this way, right?

01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:00.280
A computer asked me to find some files

01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:03.280
to find the password for the box.

01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:05.280
It wasn't to me.

01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:07.280
Directly to me.

01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:12.280
And I think it's for this box right here.

01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:14.280
A metal safe.

01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:17.280
Seems like it's locked with a 66 code.

01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:19.280
I don't remember the code.

01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:21.280
Ah, it's an 86 code.

01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:23.280
I do, I have it.

01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:27.280
Five,

01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:28.280
two,

01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:30.280
five,

01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:32.280
three, zero.

01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:34.280
Oh.

01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:49.280
Okay, if that wasn't it, then what is it?

01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:59.280
Or is it a code for something else?

02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:04.280
No.

02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:14.280
What?

02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:16.280
I'm so confused.

02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:23.280
Yeah, this is,

02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:26.280
this is what they sent me.

02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:28.280
What now?

02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:31.280
A code for a box?

02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:34.280
A code for a box?

02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:45.280
Is one of the zeros an eight?

02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:46.280
No.

02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:49.280
That's a, it's definitely a zero.

02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:54.280
It's definitely, definitely a zero.

02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:56.280
Um.

02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:00.280
Yes?

02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:03.280
Oh, no.

02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:09.280
Wait, wait.

02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:12.280
I wasn't paying attention.

02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:19.280
Can I ask him that again?

02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:25.280
Is it the same?

02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:27.280
So empty here is why it's called a baron.

02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:31.280
Are there any people living in this area besides robots?

02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:33.280
I mean, I don't know.

02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:35.280
I was not built to wander,

02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:37.280
not built to,

02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:40.280
so you just stand here and speak boring.

02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:42.280
Do you at least have friends,

02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:45.280
robot friends?

02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:48.280
I cannot desire companionship.

02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:50.280
I have not been tamed.

02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:51.280
Not tamed?

02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:53.280
There was no time.

02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:54.280
I see.

02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:59.280
Close the other questions.

02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:00.280
Prophecy?

02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:03.280
What is this prophecy exactly?

02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:08.280
The prophet predicted that a savior

02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:11.280
will arrive from another land.

02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:13.280
The savior will wake up in a strange house,

02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:16.280
find the sun, and illuminate the world.

02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:19.280
So, what else did you foresee?

02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:20.280
What do you mean?

02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:23.280
What else did you see in the prophecy?

02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:24.280
Wait.

02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:27.280
You are a prophet, right?

02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:29.280
Good heavens, no.

02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:33.280
We called it my prophecy earlier.

02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.280
That just means it is built into my programming.

02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:37.280
You are what?

02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:40.280
Ah, my programming is what guides me.

02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:42.280
I am a robot after all.

02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:43.280
I see.

02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:46.280
Another question.

02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:51.280
Tower?

02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:53.280
How tall is the tower?

02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:56.280
I can't seem to even see the top.

02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:58.280
I'm not allowed to answer.

02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:00.280
But how do I get up there?

02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:03.280
In time, as we all know what to do,

02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:04.280
I see.

02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:07.280
Is that it?

02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:09.280
Yeah, what do I do?

02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:15.280
Zora?

02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:20.280
I am not going to smash this book.

02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:29.280
Just let me smash it.

02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:30.280
Let me smash.

02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:33.280
Let me smash, please.

02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:35.280
Let me smash.

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:42.280
What do I do?

02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:45.280
What am I...

02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:49.280
I'm functional.

02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:52.280
I have fast travel, I forgot again.

02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:53.280
How do I...

02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:14.280
I have fast travel, I forgot again.

02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:15.280
How do I...

02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:20.280
Is this it?

02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:30.280
Hello, small person.

02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:33.280
You are not much better than me.

02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:36.280
Welcome to the lookout point.

02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:39.280
Below us is the old quarry.

02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:44.280
The head engineer lives a little more to the east.

02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:47.280
Never eat soggy waffles.

02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:52.280
The entrance to the old mine is further to the east.

02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:53.280
I see.

02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:57.280
They take me there.

02:04:57.280 --> 02:05:00.280
I can't open that box for some reason.

02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:05.280
You need further suits for a good thing.

02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:19.280
What do I do?

02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:38.280

02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:23.860
Sans turn off?!

02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:25.860
I can't go by those too...

I should be fine with this mask on.

02:16:52.460 --> 02:16:54.460
Is that I want to do it like me?

02:16:55.260 --> 02:16:57.260
Can't help but look at everything.

02:16:59.500 --> 02:17:03.500
Hello person, welcome to the old chemical processing plant.

02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:05.500
Most of the equipments have already been relocated.

02:17:10.220 --> 02:17:12.940
The door is ported out. The door seems loose though.

02:17:13.580 --> 02:17:15.580
I would be able to pull it off with the right tool.

02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:21.980
I, I have a tool. I can do that

02:17:23.100 --> 02:17:26.940
with my trusty screwdriver to think of this

02:17:28.860 --> 02:17:30.860
Screwdriver? I mean crowbar.

02:17:31.660 --> 02:17:33.660
Hello workout.

02:17:34.700 --> 02:17:36.700
This is a pair of rubber gloves.

02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:38.700
I'll be heavy.

02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:42.300
Is that a robot?

02:17:42.300 --> 02:17:49.500
Hello person, the robot assembly and repair services have been discontinued at the parent.

02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:54.460
If you have further inquiry, please contact the head of engineer.

02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:03.020
It seems to be a page or set of a book.

02:18:04.060 --> 02:18:06.060
Cannot overstate

02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:10.780
the importance of cleaning solvents in the environment.

02:18:11.500 --> 02:18:17.980
Here is a simple recipe using the alternative method discussed in the last chapter.

02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:21.900
Utilizing the natural properties of blue phosphor.

02:18:24.940 --> 02:18:28.140
Re, reagent? reagents?

02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:31.100
Oh no, go back.

02:18:31.100 --> 02:18:33.100
Instructions. I didn't see it. Dang.

02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:35.100
I know well, ventilated.

02:18:35.100 --> 02:18:37.100
Oops, cut.

02:18:37.100 --> 02:18:39.100
Come on, let me read it.

02:18:41.100 --> 02:18:45.100
I set a gas blue phosphor, rare form.

02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:49.100
Instructions.

02:18:49.100 --> 02:18:52.140
It's like my brain automatically presses the space bar.

02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:55.100
I don't want to press the space bar.

02:18:56.060 --> 02:19:02.060
I want in a well-ventilated area, directed the gas into your container of choice.

02:19:02.060 --> 02:19:04.060
See you immediately.

02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:11.100
Why is there bread?

02:19:11.100 --> 02:19:13.100
My chest?

02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:15.100
It comes from abroad.

02:19:15.100 --> 02:19:17.100
That's why.

02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:19.100
It comes from abroad.

02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:21.100
I really like bread.

02:19:21.100 --> 02:19:23.100
That's why.

02:19:23.100 --> 02:19:25.100
And I think YouTube likes it too.

02:19:25.100 --> 02:19:27.100
YouTube is in love with bread.

02:19:27.100 --> 02:19:29.100
So I gave YouTube bread.

02:19:47.100 --> 02:19:49.100
Want to robot without power?

02:19:49.100 --> 02:19:51.100
I guess the generator can only do so much.

02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:59.100
It's a big metal box, complicated machinery inside.

02:20:01.100 --> 02:20:03.100
Kind of looks rusty.

02:20:05.100 --> 02:20:09.100
It seems to be a payer tripped out of a box.

02:20:09.100 --> 02:20:13.100
Without breaking the seal, inject the liquid phosphor into the container.

02:20:13.100 --> 02:20:19.100
Shake vigorously to initiate the reaction.

02:20:19.100 --> 02:20:21.100
Use as soon as possible.

02:20:21.100 --> 02:20:25.100
If elements begin to separate, further shaking is required.

02:20:29.100 --> 02:20:33.100
Also note, hand protection is critical after this step.

02:20:33.100 --> 02:20:39.100
The resulting acid is moderately stronger than common household cleaners.

02:20:39.100 --> 02:20:45.100
I don't know what the half of these words mean.

02:20:45.100 --> 02:20:47.100
It's a good thing you're here, Azura.

02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:49.100
Oh yeah, I'm smart.

02:20:49.100 --> 02:20:51.100
Mm-hmm.

02:20:51.100 --> 02:20:53.100
I know everything.

02:20:59.100 --> 02:21:01.100
I got you, I got you, Miko.

02:21:05.100 --> 02:21:09.100
A cleaning sponge with a rough surface.

02:21:19.100 --> 02:21:25.100
Anything further up here?

02:21:31.100 --> 02:21:33.100
It's a gas vent.

02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:43.100
There's something weird about the robots who get sent to work near the gas field.

02:21:43.100 --> 02:21:49.100
They appear to accumulate rust at a much slower rate than the others.

02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:55.100
The few who work directly with gas harvesting looks practically new.

02:21:57.100 --> 02:22:03.100
Is that a result of the atmosphere, fear, or am I just seeing things?

02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:09.100
I just came from there.

02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:15.100
Anything else?

02:22:25.100 --> 02:22:31.100
I'm just like exploring everything, making sure I've seen it all, you know?

02:22:31.100 --> 02:22:35.100
It's a giant robot. I'm scared.

02:22:43.100 --> 02:22:47.100
Oh, hello. What are you doing here?

02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:53.100
A living person such as yourself should have evacuated this place long ago.

02:22:53.100 --> 02:22:59.100
But I just got here to this world of you. See? I have a son.

02:22:59.100 --> 02:23:03.100
Oh, the Messiah. I do not know what to say.

02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:09.100
Greetings. You were not part of my programming. Have you spoken to the Prophet Bot?

02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:15.100
I think so, yeah. Prophet Bot was built with the sole purpose of greeting you.

02:23:15.100 --> 02:23:19.100
Really? Yes, you cannot speak with anyone else.

02:23:19.100 --> 02:23:29.100
At least not with ease. Oh, that's kind of sad. Indeed it is.

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:33.100
What are you built for then? My purpose is to guard this settlement.

02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:37.100
Even though the residents have long gone, I must remain.

02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:43.100
Uh, why though? I have not been damned. Damned?

02:23:43.100 --> 02:23:49.100
It was not worth the effort. Worth the effort.

02:23:49.100 --> 02:23:59.100
Oh, it's beautiful.

02:24:09.100 --> 02:24:15.100
Ah, reporting for duty. I saw that you spoke with the guardian of this element.

02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:19.100
I will not escort you until you reach your dormitory.

02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:31.100
Um, what?

02:24:31.100 --> 02:24:35.100
It's not very good at following me.

02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:39.100
Are you just going to follow me? Yes.

02:24:39.100 --> 02:24:43.100
Until you safely reach a building of your destination.

02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:49.100
Okay, we'll go in here.

02:24:49.100 --> 02:24:55.100
Looks like they're evacuating a few tamed robots we have here.

02:24:55.100 --> 02:25:07.100
It's gonna take Nico out.

02:25:07.100 --> 02:25:09.100
Hello.

02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:17.100
Makes sense. No point in keeping them in the barrens if all the people are already gone.

02:25:17.100 --> 02:25:23.100
I wonder if the engineer is going to...

02:25:23.100 --> 02:25:29.100
Apparently phase one of the evacuation ended prematurely.

02:25:29.100 --> 02:25:35.100
The big ships started malfunctioning only after a few round trips.

02:25:35.100 --> 02:25:41.100
They said it was due to something with squares.

02:25:41.100 --> 02:25:44.100
I'm not sure what they mean by that.

02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:54.100
Bummer. Looks like they won't be able to transport most of these surplus bots to the city at this rate.

02:25:54.100 --> 02:25:58.100
And we worked so hard on those.

02:25:58.100 --> 02:26:06.100
I suppose the robots are busy enough with the transporting people as is.

02:26:06.100 --> 02:26:12.100
I think it's going to be our turn soon.

02:26:12.100 --> 02:26:16.100
It's a parcel, I think. There's writing on this one too.

02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:29.100
It says Guardian of Residential Area.

02:26:29.100 --> 02:26:42.100
I'm scared of ladders.

02:26:42.100 --> 02:26:54.100
Hmm.

02:26:54.100 --> 02:27:10.100
Some of the ink in this page is faded.

02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:17.100
Likely due to some sort of electrical and magnetic interference.

02:27:17.100 --> 02:27:21.100
I'm afraid this operation can no longer be sustained.

02:27:21.100 --> 02:27:28.100
If the servers continue to fail, so much that maintenance cannot keep up the pace.

02:27:28.100 --> 02:27:32.100
Fortunately it does not seem to be happening to the robots.

02:27:32.100 --> 02:27:40.100
At least not at a significant rate. Time to tell.

02:27:40.100 --> 02:27:48.100
All of these terminals are not good. I'm not sure what to do now.

02:27:48.100 --> 02:27:54.100
Check it. Check it. Terminals does not respond. This is a problem.

02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:08.100
You can't catch me.

02:28:08.100 --> 02:28:14.100
I remember being taught in school how the water is surrounding the forest,

02:28:14.100 --> 02:28:22.100
stretched until the boundaries.

02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:25.100
Boundaries. The word just does not look right here.

02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:28.100
I don't know why. It just doesn't look right.

02:28:28.100 --> 02:28:32.100
Boundaries of space.

02:28:32.100 --> 02:28:44.100
But at some point, the fifth prehistoric oceans resend.

02:28:44.100 --> 02:28:54.100
Forming what is now the parents. I wonder where all that water went.

02:28:54.100 --> 02:29:19.100
A picture of a robot.

02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:23.100
A picture of a robot.

02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:27.100
You know, I've never been around so many robots before, Azora.

02:29:27.100 --> 02:29:34.100
Or any robots at all. I mean, I've seen them in cartoons and stuff.

02:29:34.100 --> 02:29:40.100
But I've never seen one in person. They're pretty neat. They're pretty neat.

02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:45.100
Don't you think?

02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:49.100
I need to go do a robot voice.

02:29:49.100 --> 02:29:55.100
What? Did I talk like a robot?

02:29:55.100 --> 02:29:59.100
Be boop. Be boop.

02:29:59.100 --> 02:30:04.100
Be boop. I'm a robot. Be boop.

02:30:04.100 --> 02:30:15.100
I'm a robot and I eat batteries instead of normal people food.

02:30:15.100 --> 02:30:18.100
He's so cute.

02:30:18.100 --> 02:30:25.100
That is not Greg.

02:30:25.100 --> 02:30:31.100
Robots do not consume batteries in the same way people consume food.

02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:43.100
In fact, robots do not possess digestive systems. Some robots do not even have mouths.

02:30:43.100 --> 02:30:54.100
Azora.

02:30:54.100 --> 02:31:05.100
I'm sorry, Nika. I'm so sorry.

02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:19.100
You made me look sorry.

02:31:19.100 --> 02:31:41.100
I'm so cute.

02:31:41.100 --> 02:31:46.100
I'm sorry, Nika.

02:31:46.100 --> 02:31:53.100
Hello. Hi. What are you doing up there?

02:31:53.100 --> 02:32:01.100
I'm stationed here by yourself. Yes.

02:32:01.100 --> 02:32:08.100
Azora? Yeah, nothing else to say?

02:32:08.100 --> 02:32:19.100
Is that it? Alright. It's cool.

02:32:19.100 --> 02:32:22.100
Hello, organic person who is alive.

02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:27.100
An infirmary is a bad infirmary.

02:32:27.100 --> 02:32:33.100
Reporting for duty, it seems that you already have an assigned escort.

02:32:33.100 --> 02:32:37.100
Would you like me to leave? You can follow me if you want.

02:32:37.100 --> 02:32:46.100
Understood. I will now escort you until you reach your dormitory.

02:32:46.100 --> 02:32:53.100
Doctor. Hello, person of organic makeup.

02:32:53.100 --> 02:32:58.100
Welcome to the infirmary. Scanning for injuries?

02:32:58.100 --> 02:33:05.100
Scan complete. Ender is detected? None. Treatment required? None. You're good to go.

02:33:05.100 --> 02:33:09.100
Thanks.

02:33:09.100 --> 02:33:13.100
What's this? The box of medical clothes?

02:33:13.100 --> 02:33:20.100
Most of them are broken or rested beyond you, but this plastic syringe seems to be okay.

02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:23.100
Cool. Hello, person.

02:33:23.100 --> 02:33:28.100
Are you seeking admission to the infirmary? No?

02:33:28.100 --> 02:33:32.100
Oh. Carry on then.

02:33:32.100 --> 02:33:39.100
Anyone up there?

02:33:39.100 --> 02:33:45.100
Anyone up here? No one up there?

02:33:45.100 --> 02:33:50.100
Hey.

02:33:51.100 --> 02:33:59.100
Was I in this building already? 118? I was.

02:33:59.100 --> 02:34:04.100
It's in this one.

02:34:04.100 --> 02:34:11.100
Hey sweetie. Six more weeks until you can come home. About time, huh?

02:34:11.100 --> 02:34:16.100
Gosh. I can't imagine living in that awful capsule wall.

02:34:16.100 --> 02:34:21.100
Dorm. Thing. But guess what?

02:34:21.100 --> 02:34:31.100
Soon you'll get to sleep in a real bed and eat real food again. Right back soon. Love, mom.

02:34:37.100 --> 02:34:45.100
Looks like we're supposed to pack stuff for the evacuation starting today. I wish these books weren't so heavy.

02:34:45.100 --> 02:34:58.100
It's gonna be a pain to carry them onto the ship, but there by the author, I can't just throw them away.

02:34:58.100 --> 02:35:03.100
Anyone up here? No.

02:35:03.100 --> 02:35:14.100
Anyone up here? No.

02:35:14.100 --> 02:35:17.100
Let's go bowling.

02:35:17.100 --> 02:35:27.100
Are you guys not supposed to go into buildings? Correct. We are built for outdoor use only.

02:35:27.100 --> 02:35:38.100
And during buildings is not part of our programming. That's strange. Excuse me.

02:35:38.100 --> 02:35:49.100
Is this evacuation? As such short notice, I can't believe this. First the sun dies, and now I'm out of a job.

02:35:49.100 --> 02:35:57.100
Some sort of medical, mechanical drying.

02:35:57.100 --> 02:36:03.100
A robot beyond repair.

02:36:08.100 --> 02:36:19.100
We are a cat person because that is what the prophet told. We have no choice.

02:36:19.100 --> 02:36:28.100
Honestly, I shall accept your fate.

02:36:28.100 --> 02:36:34.100
Nothing down here.

02:36:38.100 --> 02:36:56.100
It's a lot over here.

02:36:56.100 --> 02:37:02.100
Am I forgetting something? Am I supposed to do something over here?

02:37:03.100 --> 02:37:16.100
This vent is on the ground. All the others are taller than me.

02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:21.100
Are these syringe?

02:37:21.100 --> 02:37:29.100
The vent is on the ground. No, not syringe.

02:37:29.100 --> 02:37:45.100
A bottle? I guess you want to fill the bottle with the gas, Sarah? Yeah. I don't want to do it.

02:37:46.100 --> 02:37:56.100
Initially the amount of noxious fumes emitted by the natural gas vents caught our team of guard.

02:37:56.100 --> 02:38:01.100
Thank goodness the medical team reacted as quickly as they did.

02:38:01.100 --> 02:38:15.100
Despite its failure, that the first expedition did bring up some interesting observations about the parents, we found that there is not one but two such vent songs.

02:38:15.100 --> 02:38:25.100
With fumes being pumped out at such high concentrations, it seems a miracle that the gas hasn't spread anywhere else.

02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:32.100
Our biologists concluded that the phosphorus wrench.

02:38:32.100 --> 02:38:45.100
Phosphor shrimp and the creator pools were actively consuming the gas. The shrimp in the ocean also prevent the gas from laughting off into the cleans.

02:38:45.100 --> 02:38:53.100
If that's the case, then we owe a lot to these little guys.

02:38:53.100 --> 02:39:08.100
What's that?

02:39:09.100 --> 02:39:13.100
Hello? Can we go back now?

02:39:13.100 --> 02:39:16.100
E, what's over there?

02:39:16.100 --> 02:39:21.100
Was I here already? I feel like I was.

02:39:21.100 --> 02:39:25.100
I guess not. What the heck is that?

02:39:25.100 --> 02:39:29.100
Anything else over here? A robot.

02:39:29.100 --> 02:39:41.100
Sky's dark. That it is. Do you know when the sun will be back up? We're working on it.

02:39:41.100 --> 02:39:45.100
What is this?

02:39:45.100 --> 02:39:54.100
Pond sure looks different, but it looks like jelly. It's formed a bubble over the surface of the pond.

02:39:55.100 --> 02:40:01.100
Is that what this is for?

02:40:01.100 --> 02:40:13.100
So, fulfilling all the syringes are, I guess it's kind of like a funnel, but the liquid might be a bit too thick to fit in the needle.

02:40:13.100 --> 02:40:19.100
Hey, it actually went in. Gross.

02:40:24.100 --> 02:40:42.100
So, should I inject the liquid through the cork, right, Azora? Yeah, it's like I'm a doctor.

02:40:42.100 --> 02:40:47.100
Oh, I should probably shake this too.

02:40:47.100 --> 02:40:51.100
Change color.

02:40:51.100 --> 02:41:16.100
A bottle of acid.

02:41:16.100 --> 02:41:22.100
It reminds you of that food segment of ASMR.

02:41:22.100 --> 02:41:26.100
A cookie eating.

02:41:26.100 --> 02:41:29.100
Where is he?

02:41:29.100 --> 02:41:31.100
It's a robot.

02:41:31.100 --> 02:41:34.100
That's a place right there.

02:41:34.100 --> 02:41:40.100
A mirror hanging there.

02:41:40.100 --> 02:41:45.100
A bottle of acid.

02:41:45.100 --> 02:41:50.100
A sponge. I guess you want me to pour this acid into a sponge?

02:41:50.100 --> 02:41:54.100
Because I have these gloves.

02:41:54.100 --> 02:41:56.100
I hope this works.

02:41:56.100 --> 02:42:04.100
Oh, it's a sponge.

02:42:04.100 --> 02:42:09.100
Alright, I'll still have no other choice.

02:42:09.100 --> 02:42:14.100
What a funny robot.

02:42:14.100 --> 02:42:17.100
There. How's that?

02:42:17.100 --> 02:42:21.100
I can move again. Thank you.

02:42:21.100 --> 02:42:23.100
Little heart.

02:42:23.100 --> 02:42:27.100
I'm able to fulfill my purpose again.

02:42:27.100 --> 02:42:29.100
Where would you like to go?

02:42:29.100 --> 02:42:31.100
Can you take me to the tower?

02:42:31.100 --> 02:42:32.100
Calculating.

02:42:32.100 --> 02:42:38.100
Of course, the destination to the tower is the Glen Port.

02:42:38.100 --> 02:42:41.100
My build and navigation circuits are fried.

02:42:41.100 --> 02:42:45.100
I'm gonna assume that's not good.

02:42:45.100 --> 02:42:48.100
But it's not good at all.

02:42:48.100 --> 02:42:51.100
Once again, I cannot follow my programming.

02:42:51.100 --> 02:42:54.100
Is there anything I can do to help?

02:42:54.100 --> 02:42:57.100
If I end up in here, I should speak to the head engineer.

02:42:57.100 --> 02:43:00.100
She will know what to do.

02:43:00.100 --> 02:43:12.100
I'm assuming that redhead lady or redhead person.

02:43:12.100 --> 02:43:14.100
Redhead man?

02:43:14.100 --> 02:43:18.100
Redhead man. Redhead person.

02:43:18.100 --> 02:43:25.100
Red, redhead.

02:43:25.100 --> 02:43:28.100
Fast, fast, fast travel.

02:43:28.100 --> 02:43:31.100
You're right.

02:43:31.100 --> 02:43:33.100
I forgot.

02:43:33.100 --> 02:43:39.100
I forgot.

02:43:39.100 --> 02:43:42.100
Excuse me again, Miss.

02:43:42.100 --> 02:43:43.100
Miss.

02:43:43.100 --> 02:43:46.100
Good-bye, lady.

02:43:46.100 --> 02:43:50.100
I found a robot who can take me towards the tower.

02:43:50.100 --> 02:43:53.100
But, maverick's in trouble.

02:43:53.100 --> 02:43:55.100
Well, tell me to talk to you.

02:43:55.100 --> 02:43:57.100
Alright, what is the issue?

02:43:57.100 --> 02:44:01.100
Is there something about navigation circuits being fried?

02:44:01.100 --> 02:44:03.100
Just the navigation circuit?

02:44:03.100 --> 02:44:04.100
Apparently.

02:44:04.100 --> 02:44:07.100
Sir and I fixed everything else, I think.

02:44:07.100 --> 02:44:10.100
I have something that may help.

02:44:10.100 --> 02:44:12.100
Robots.

02:44:12.100 --> 02:44:14.100
Robots.

02:44:14.100 --> 02:44:19.100
Robo, robo.

02:44:19.100 --> 02:44:26.100
How the ability to trace material from their source locations.

02:44:26.100 --> 02:44:28.100
Have you let the robot borrow this,

02:44:28.100 --> 02:44:31.100
and this backup tracking system should activate?

02:44:31.100 --> 02:44:32.100
Ah.

02:44:37.100 --> 02:44:39.100
That's a very pretty necklace.

02:44:39.100 --> 02:44:40.100
What's it made of?

02:44:40.100 --> 02:44:42.100
amber

02:44:42.100 --> 02:44:44.100
found from the glen

02:44:44.100 --> 02:44:46.100
what's the thing inside the amber

02:44:46.100 --> 02:44:48.100
black clover

02:44:48.100 --> 02:44:50.100
that's a common plant in our world

02:44:50.100 --> 02:44:52.100
it's also

02:44:56.100 --> 02:45:00.100
I'm not sure if I can bear the part with this

02:45:00.100 --> 02:45:02.100
my programming says yes

02:45:02.100 --> 02:45:06.100
but I still feel complicated

02:45:06.100 --> 02:45:08.100
a robot that feels

02:45:08.100 --> 02:45:10.100
feelings

02:45:20.100 --> 02:45:22.100
you need to finish your mission

02:45:22.100 --> 02:45:24.100
more than I need to keep saying

02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:26.100
here

02:45:26.100 --> 02:45:28.100
thank you

02:45:38.100 --> 02:45:40.100
what a cute jingle

02:45:40.100 --> 02:45:42.100
before I go

02:45:42.100 --> 02:45:44.100
is there anything I can do in return

02:45:44.100 --> 02:45:46.100
actually

02:45:46.100 --> 02:45:48.100
you know how to play chess

02:45:48.100 --> 02:45:50.100
yeah

02:45:50.100 --> 02:45:52.100
well, Florida

02:45:52.100 --> 02:45:54.100
I played it with some older kids before

02:45:54.100 --> 02:45:56.100
then will you play a game with me

02:45:56.100 --> 02:45:58.100
I mean

02:45:58.100 --> 02:46:00.100
I don't know the rules very well

02:46:00.100 --> 02:46:02.100
but I guess it's the least I can do

02:46:02.100 --> 02:46:04.100
really good at this

02:46:04.100 --> 02:46:06.100
thank you

02:46:06.100 --> 02:46:08.100
it was built into my code

02:46:08.100 --> 02:46:10.100
ah

02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:12.100
so

02:46:12.100 --> 02:46:14.100
what's it like being a robot and all

02:46:14.100 --> 02:46:16.100
I've talked to other robots

02:46:16.100 --> 02:46:18.100
and

02:46:18.100 --> 02:46:20.100
they all say something about programming

02:46:20.100 --> 02:46:22.100
and code and stuff

02:46:22.100 --> 02:46:24.100
even you did just now

02:46:24.100 --> 02:46:26.100
it's a little hard to understand sometimes

02:46:26.100 --> 02:46:28.100
I know

02:46:28.100 --> 02:46:30.100
I know

02:46:30.100 --> 02:46:32.100
most of the robots here are

02:46:32.100 --> 02:46:34.100
not tamed

02:46:34.100 --> 02:46:36.100
tamed

02:46:36.100 --> 02:46:38.100
watch out

02:46:38.100 --> 02:46:40.100
here goes my bishop

02:46:40.100 --> 02:46:42.100
taming

02:46:42.100 --> 02:46:44.100
it's complicated

02:46:44.100 --> 02:46:46.100
oh

02:46:46.100 --> 02:46:48.100
how complicated exactly

02:46:50.100 --> 02:46:52.100
there goes my other bishop

02:46:52.100 --> 02:46:54.100
niko ma go da chas

02:46:54.100 --> 02:46:56.100
I mean

02:46:56.100 --> 02:46:58.100
neither

02:46:58.100 --> 02:47:00.100
I'm horrible at it

02:47:00.100 --> 02:47:02.100
I'm good at checkers

02:47:02.100 --> 02:47:04.100
is that count

02:47:04.100 --> 02:47:06.100
I like checkers

02:47:10.100 --> 02:47:12.100
I can't really explain

02:47:12.100 --> 02:47:14.100
what tamed robots are

02:47:14.100 --> 02:47:16.100
but

02:47:16.100 --> 02:47:18.100
I'm one of them

02:47:20.100 --> 02:47:22.100
all the other tamed robots

02:47:22.100 --> 02:47:24.100
move to other regions

02:47:24.100 --> 02:47:26.100
exactly where

02:47:26.100 --> 02:47:28.100
I don't know

02:47:28.100 --> 02:47:30.100
oh

02:47:32.100 --> 02:47:34.100
there goes my little horse

02:47:34.100 --> 02:47:36.100
knight

02:47:36.100 --> 02:47:38.100
right

02:47:38.100 --> 02:47:40.100
wow

02:47:44.100 --> 02:47:46.100
a feeling robot

02:47:46.100 --> 02:47:48.100
my dream

02:47:48.100 --> 02:47:50.100
wow

02:47:52.100 --> 02:47:54.100
I have to go now

02:47:54.100 --> 02:47:56.100
I have a good dream

02:47:56.100 --> 02:47:58.100
thank you and have a good day

02:47:58.100 --> 02:48:00.100
or night

02:48:00.100 --> 02:48:02.100
hope to see you soon

02:48:02.100 --> 02:48:04.100
checkers are fun too

02:48:04.100 --> 02:48:06.100
it is

02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:08.100
very fun

02:48:08.100 --> 02:48:10.100
I like checkers

02:48:10.100 --> 02:48:12.100
just as hard

02:48:12.100 --> 02:48:14.100
my memory

02:48:14.100 --> 02:48:16.100
it's very bad

02:48:16.100 --> 02:48:18.100
so I can't really remember rules

02:48:18.100 --> 02:48:20.100
easy

02:48:20.100 --> 02:48:22.100
oh

02:48:22.100 --> 02:48:24.100
have you ever been to any other regions

02:48:24.100 --> 02:48:26.100
I heard that there's two more

02:48:26.100 --> 02:48:28.100
in the past

02:48:28.100 --> 02:48:30.100
yes

02:48:30.100 --> 02:48:32.100
I have the data

02:48:32.100 --> 02:48:34.100
the coordinates

02:48:34.100 --> 02:48:36.100
the coordinates

02:48:36.100 --> 02:48:38.100
the memories

02:48:38.100 --> 02:48:40.100
I don't know how much of that still holds true

02:48:42.100 --> 02:48:44.100
the world

02:48:44.100 --> 02:48:46.100
the world may be very different

02:48:46.100 --> 02:48:48.100
place now

02:48:48.100 --> 02:48:50.100
the sun is gone

02:48:50.100 --> 02:48:52.100
no

02:48:52.100 --> 02:48:54.100
I said this already, didn't I

02:48:54.100 --> 02:48:56.100
the sun probably won't save the world

02:48:56.100 --> 02:48:58.100
the decaying started back

02:48:58.100 --> 02:49:00.100
before the sun went out

02:49:00.100 --> 02:49:02.100
the sun's sudden death

02:49:02.100 --> 02:49:04.100
was just the tipping point

02:49:04.100 --> 02:49:06.100
and things went south really fast

02:49:06.100 --> 02:49:08.100
after that

02:49:08.100 --> 02:49:10.100
oh

02:49:10.100 --> 02:49:12.100
then there's nothing I can do

02:49:12.100 --> 02:49:14.100
check

02:49:14.100 --> 02:49:16.100
what?

02:49:16.100 --> 02:49:18.100
the only thing you can do

02:49:18.100 --> 02:49:20.100
is complete your

02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:22.100
pilgrimage

02:49:22.100 --> 02:49:24.100
in a way

02:49:24.100 --> 02:49:26.100
you're only supposed to be a second chance for the people

02:49:28.100 --> 02:49:30.100
just like how the barons

02:49:30.100 --> 02:49:32.100
was only supposed to be a second chance for me

02:49:32.100 --> 02:49:34.100
there's no guarantee

02:49:34.100 --> 02:49:36.100
that things will work out

02:49:36.100 --> 02:49:38.100
but

02:49:38.100 --> 02:49:40.100
checkmate

02:49:40.100 --> 02:49:42.100
alright

02:49:42.100 --> 02:49:44.100
guess I've kept you long enough

02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:46.100
thank you for listening

02:49:46.100 --> 02:49:48.100
I hope

02:49:48.100 --> 02:49:50.100

02:49:58.100 --> 02:50:00.100
off you go

02:50:00.100 --> 02:50:02.100

02:50:02.100 --> 02:50:04.100
am I able to go

02:50:06.100 --> 02:50:08.100

02:50:10.100 --> 02:50:12.100
will they take me

02:50:12.100 --> 02:50:14.100
or is that a no

02:50:16.100 --> 02:50:18.100
safety violation

02:50:20.100 --> 02:50:22.100
take me I want to go

02:50:22.100 --> 02:50:24.100

02:50:24.100 --> 02:50:26.100
will I ever be able to go over there

02:50:32.100 --> 02:50:34.100
sorry

02:50:34.100 --> 02:50:36.100
excuse me for yawning

02:50:36.100 --> 02:50:38.100
I have an asterisk

02:50:38.100 --> 02:50:40.100

02:50:40.100 --> 02:50:42.100

02:50:42.100 --> 02:50:44.100
best travel

02:50:44.100 --> 02:50:46.100
I'm sorry again

02:50:46.100 --> 02:50:48.100
old factory

02:50:48.100 --> 02:50:50.100
hundreds

02:50:50.100 --> 02:50:52.100
or wait

02:50:52.100 --> 02:50:54.100
can I go

02:50:54.100 --> 02:50:56.100
box

02:50:56.100 --> 02:50:58.100
nice

02:51:02.100 --> 02:51:04.100
there he is

02:51:04.100 --> 02:51:06.100
what

02:51:08.100 --> 02:51:10.100
have you talked to the head engineer yet

02:51:10.100 --> 02:51:12.100
he lives in the main mine entrance

02:51:12.100 --> 02:51:14.100
I would have given up on

02:51:14.100 --> 02:51:16.100
what

02:51:16.100 --> 02:51:18.100
I did

02:51:22.100 --> 02:51:24.100
that's not what I meant to do

02:51:28.100 --> 02:51:30.100
oh this is amber

02:51:30.100 --> 02:51:32.100
from the glen

02:51:32.100 --> 02:51:34.100
I can remember now

02:51:34.100 --> 02:51:36.100
activating tracking system

02:51:36.100 --> 02:51:38.100
setting course

02:51:38.100 --> 02:51:40.100
wait

02:51:40.100 --> 02:51:42.100
this boat

02:51:42.100 --> 02:51:44.100
is over capacity

02:51:44.100 --> 02:51:46.100
you'll need to leave behind

02:51:46.100 --> 02:51:48.100
some of your possession

02:51:48.100 --> 02:51:50.100
oh well

02:51:50.100 --> 02:51:52.100
I don't think I'll be needing this crowbar anymore

02:51:52.100 --> 02:51:54.100
for this gas mag

02:51:56.100 --> 02:51:58.100
this is acceptable

02:51:58.100 --> 02:52:00.100
onwards we go

02:52:00.100 --> 02:52:02.100
I don't know

02:52:02.100 --> 02:52:04.100
row row row

02:52:04.100 --> 02:52:06.100
your boat down lay down

02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:08.100
a stream

02:52:08.100 --> 02:52:10.100
merrily merrily merrily

02:52:10.100 --> 02:52:12.100
life is but a dream

02:52:12.100 --> 02:52:14.100
so cute

02:52:18.100 --> 02:52:20.100
oh shit

02:52:26.100 --> 02:52:28.100
here's your stop

02:52:28.100 --> 02:52:30.100
the glen

02:52:30.100 --> 02:52:32.100
wow

02:52:34.100 --> 02:52:36.100
thank you

02:52:38.100 --> 02:52:40.100
you should be a village to the north

02:52:40.100 --> 02:52:42.100
that's all I can recall

02:52:42.100 --> 02:52:44.100
that's good to know

02:52:44.100 --> 02:52:46.100
farewell

02:52:46.100 --> 02:52:48.100
may your mission be a success

02:52:48.100 --> 02:52:50.100
are you leaving

02:52:50.100 --> 02:52:52.100
yes I must return to my station

02:52:54.100 --> 02:52:56.100
but you'll be all alone again

02:52:56.100 --> 02:52:58.100
it's okay

02:52:58.100 --> 02:53:00.100
I have not been tamed

02:53:08.100 --> 02:53:10.100
I think

02:53:10.100 --> 02:53:12.100
water

02:53:16.100 --> 02:53:18.100
oh

02:53:26.100 --> 02:53:28.100
there's two doors

02:53:42.100 --> 02:53:44.100
was there anything else over there

02:53:44.100 --> 02:53:46.100
was that they scared me

02:53:46.100 --> 02:53:48.100
they're running in a circle

02:53:52.100 --> 02:53:54.100
I think

02:53:54.100 --> 02:53:56.100
I think

02:53:58.100 --> 02:54:00.100
I think we'll call it

02:54:00.100 --> 02:54:02.100
for today

02:54:02.100 --> 02:54:04.100
for one shot

02:54:06.100 --> 02:54:08.100
I will play the rest tomorrow

02:54:08.100 --> 02:54:10.100
yeah

02:54:20.100 --> 02:54:22.100
since we're in a new place now

02:54:22.100 --> 02:54:24.100
I think they said when we leave

02:54:26.100 --> 02:54:28.100
it automatically saves yes

02:54:28.100 --> 02:54:30.100
I think

02:54:36.100 --> 02:54:38.100
yeah

02:54:40.100 --> 02:54:42.100
you should auto save

02:54:44.100 --> 02:54:46.100
excellent

02:54:46.100 --> 02:54:48.100
that's good

02:54:52.100 --> 02:54:54.100
we can sit and chat for a little bit

02:54:54.100 --> 02:54:56.100
before I go

02:54:56.100 --> 02:54:58.100
we don't have to leave right away

02:54:58.100 --> 02:55:00.100
we can chat for a little bit

02:55:00.100 --> 02:55:02.100
but

02:55:02.100 --> 02:55:04.100
we'll stop the game here

02:55:04.100 --> 02:55:06.100
right now

02:55:12.100 --> 02:55:14.100
this action will record your progress in this world

02:55:16.100 --> 02:55:18.100
to return to this world again

02:55:18.100 --> 02:55:20.100
we need to relaunch

02:55:20.100 --> 02:55:22.100
the app

02:55:22.100 --> 02:55:24.100
we'll see it

02:55:24.100 --> 02:55:26.100
yes

02:55:26.100 --> 02:55:28.100
excellent

02:55:30.100 --> 02:55:32.100
yeah

02:55:40.100 --> 02:55:42.100
yes let's chat

02:55:50.100 --> 02:55:52.100
that was fun

02:55:52.100 --> 02:55:54.100
so far

02:55:54.100 --> 02:55:56.100
a lot of things I don't remember

02:55:56.100 --> 02:55:58.100
while playing

02:55:58.100 --> 02:56:00.100
the game

02:56:00.100 --> 02:56:02.100
make me bugger

02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:04.100
bugger

02:56:08.100 --> 02:56:10.100
I have to take my medication

02:56:10.100 --> 02:56:12.100
medication time

02:56:12.100 --> 02:56:14.100
go

02:56:20.100 --> 02:56:22.100
you saw nothing

02:56:22.100 --> 02:56:24.100
you saw nothing

02:56:28.100 --> 02:56:30.100
are you

02:56:30.100 --> 02:56:32.100
are you fine

02:56:44.100 --> 02:56:46.100
where are they

02:56:46.100 --> 02:56:48.100
how are you feeling

02:56:48.100 --> 02:56:50.100
I'm feeling alright

02:56:50.100 --> 02:56:52.100
just a little bit yippie

02:56:52.100 --> 02:56:54.100
a tiny bit

02:56:58.100 --> 02:57:00.100
I'm very happy

02:57:00.100 --> 02:57:02.100
and relaxed

02:57:02.100 --> 02:57:04.100
so far though

02:57:06.100 --> 02:57:08.100
so yeah

02:57:10.100 --> 02:57:12.100
bro

02:57:16.100 --> 02:57:18.100
bro

02:57:30.100 --> 02:57:32.100
do we have a patreon scheduled

02:57:34.100 --> 02:57:36.100
I am actually

02:57:36.100 --> 02:57:38.100
not really sure when

02:57:38.100 --> 02:57:40.100
the stuff does get released

02:57:42.100 --> 02:57:44.100
or I was probably told

02:57:44.100 --> 02:57:46.100
and I forgot

02:57:48.100 --> 02:57:50.100
so I can't really tell you

02:57:56.100 --> 02:57:58.100
so if you want to know that

02:57:58.100 --> 02:58:00.100
information

02:58:00.100 --> 02:58:02.100
I can't give that to you right now

02:58:14.100 --> 02:58:16.100
yeah

02:58:28.100 --> 02:58:30.100
if it's for

02:58:30.100 --> 02:58:32.100
per month

02:58:32.100 --> 02:58:34.100
per month

02:58:36.100 --> 02:58:38.100
shouldn't it be every saturday

02:58:38.100 --> 02:58:40.100
possibly

02:58:40.100 --> 02:58:42.100
possibly but I'm not sure

02:58:44.100 --> 02:58:46.100
I am actually not sure

02:58:46.100 --> 02:58:48.100
I can't help but still whisper

02:58:48.100 --> 02:58:50.100
I don't have to

02:58:50.100 --> 02:58:52.100
but

02:58:52.100 --> 02:58:54.100
as it feels

02:58:54.100 --> 02:58:56.100
like a habit

02:58:56.100 --> 02:58:58.100
where I need to whisper

02:59:00.100 --> 02:59:02.100
but I lie

02:59:14.100 --> 02:59:16.100
bro

02:59:30.100 --> 02:59:32.100
oh man

02:59:32.100 --> 02:59:34.100
it's alright

02:59:34.100 --> 02:59:36.100
one step at a time

02:59:36.100 --> 02:59:38.100
don't worry things will come

02:59:38.100 --> 02:59:40.100
into play this time guys

02:59:40.100 --> 02:59:42.100
so don't worry

02:59:42.100 --> 02:59:44.100
or anything will be fine

02:59:44.100 --> 02:59:46.100
bigger

02:59:46.100 --> 02:59:48.100
bigger

02:59:48.100 --> 02:59:50.100
bigger

02:59:50.100 --> 02:59:52.100
bigger

02:59:54.100 --> 02:59:56.100
I can't stop

02:59:56.100 --> 02:59:58.100
I can't stop

02:59:58.100 --> 03:00:00.100
I can't stop

03:00:04.100 --> 03:00:06.100
I'm used to whispering

03:00:08.100 --> 03:00:10.100
being your natural voice

03:00:10.100 --> 03:00:12.100
I don't naturally

03:00:12.100 --> 03:00:14.100
I don't normally whisper

03:00:14.100 --> 03:00:16.100
but

03:00:16.100 --> 03:00:18.100
it just comes

03:00:18.100 --> 03:00:20.100
let me

03:00:20.100 --> 03:00:22.100
say bye

03:00:22.100 --> 03:00:24.100
ok

03:00:48.100 --> 03:00:50.100
sorry it's really hard to swallow

03:00:50.100 --> 03:00:52.100
because of my esophagus

03:00:52.100 --> 03:00:54.100
being swollen

03:00:54.100 --> 03:00:56.100
so taking my

03:00:56.100 --> 03:00:58.100
medication sometimes hurts

03:00:58.100 --> 03:01:00.100
a little bit

03:01:16.100 --> 03:01:18.100
I don't have

03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:20.100
I'm just vibing

03:01:20.100 --> 03:01:22.100
right now

03:01:30.100 --> 03:01:32.100
so how has everyone been

03:01:32.100 --> 03:01:34.100
I hope you all had

03:01:34.100 --> 03:01:36.100
a good day

03:01:36.100 --> 03:01:38.100
and if not good I hope

03:01:38.100 --> 03:01:40.100
I made it a little better

03:01:40.100 --> 03:01:42.100
I hope we made it a little better

03:01:48.100 --> 03:01:50.100
maybe

03:02:00.100 --> 03:02:02.100
let me wake up to work tomorrow good night

03:02:02.100 --> 03:02:04.100

03:17:09.060 --> 03:17:10.260
so so not today

03:17:14.260 --> 03:17:16.660
i don't think youtube wants to see that right now

03:17:16.660 --> 03:17:18.660
no

03:17:24.180 --> 03:17:26.180
i'm gonna show you my toes

03:17:34.340 --> 03:17:36.340
but

03:17:39.700 --> 03:17:41.700
oh yeah

03:17:41.700 --> 03:17:43.700
you guys saw nothing

03:17:43.780 --> 03:17:45.780
saw nothing

03:18:08.340 --> 03:18:11.380
good thing i'm so bad at everything

03:18:14.020 --> 03:18:18.500
yeah stuff you don't need but would like to have yes

03:18:19.780 --> 03:18:22.020
i just add random stuff to the

03:18:22.820 --> 03:18:32.980
the list i have a mini fridge in my my my my room uh because uh i need to store some of my medication in a fridge

03:18:32.980 --> 03:18:40.100
and it's better to have it close behind so i have some water and some drinks that i can get to really fast

03:18:40.820 --> 03:18:42.260
in the mini fridge

03:18:42.260 --> 03:18:46.580
but i've had this mini fridge for so long that it mount my functions every now and then

03:18:47.220 --> 03:18:55.380
so i added that to the throw list i just added whatever i already kind of have but i know it's broken or whatever

03:18:55.780 --> 03:19:02.100
so i'm like hi i guess i can add this all right it's whatever here you go put that there

03:19:02.820 --> 03:19:08.500
i didn't want to have the the thrown empty so i added random stuff

03:19:10.740 --> 03:19:12.740
so

03:19:25.780 --> 03:19:28.100
we need a code word for it is more

03:20:33.140 --> 03:20:37.300
i just like being given the chance to stream overhaul for you guys

03:20:40.180 --> 03:20:45.140
if youtube uh wants to come after us then it's fine that is what it is

03:20:45.700 --> 03:20:47.700
yes

03:20:49.860 --> 03:20:53.940

03:20:57.300 --> 03:21:06.260
but if uh stroney and everyone wants to fight it i will be there by their side regardless of it all

maybe it's because they're live streams probably most likely

03:21:52.660 --> 03:21:58.660
to be honest i think i got hit mid of that stream like in the middle of it because um

03:22:00.420 --> 03:22:02.420
in the middle of the stream

03:22:03.380 --> 03:22:10.420
uh no one could search me up for some reason uh some of my

03:22:10.580 --> 03:22:18.420
gen mates up but i don't know who knows but possibly

03:22:41.060 --> 03:22:46.180
thankfully the archivists are very reliable so you won't lose any of it and i appreciate them

03:22:46.180 --> 03:22:49.780
thank you so much for those who archive the the god

03:22:52.660 --> 03:22:56.340
um i don't think we're able to um

03:22:58.580 --> 03:23:04.900
i can't i don't know how to archive stuff so it's out of my knowledge

03:23:06.260 --> 03:23:08.900
i am not advanced in that technique

03:23:10.740 --> 03:23:14.580
technology and technicality however you say it

03:23:17.620 --> 03:23:23.620

03:23:24.260 --> 03:23:32.420
download it i i already tried it won't let you video is gone completely if a video gets taken down

03:23:34.900 --> 03:23:37.540

03:24:01.060 --> 03:24:07.540
um

03:24:10.420 --> 03:24:13.620

03:24:53.860 --> 03:25:06.340
yes the option though doesn't always the option to record and stream i would have to remember to click the button

03:25:06.900 --> 03:25:10.020
it doesn't just ask you to do both uh

03:25:12.100 --> 03:25:18.580
and i don't really have the memory to always press that button i wanted to record it

03:25:19.140 --> 03:25:26.980
yesterday i'm fully aware that i can record it but that um uh i cannot help

03:25:28.100 --> 03:25:32.740
if i don't remember so i'm really sorry about that

talented no this was actually one of my first times using eyedrops never used eyedrops before

03:30:00.260 --> 03:30:06.900
when my my eye doctor recommended it i was like i'm a little scared i was very very scared

03:30:06.900 --> 03:30:13.940
to put it in my eye i also learned do not put eyedrops in if the bottle is cold try to get the

03:30:13.940 --> 03:30:20.980
liquid a little warm a little bit warmer before putting in your eyes cold liquid in your eye

03:30:20.980 --> 03:30:29.940
does not feel good it does not feel good at all it almost feels like it you have pressure on your eye

03:30:30.740 --> 03:30:31.380
and it hurts

03:30:37.300 --> 03:30:42.420
i got tons of autoimmune problems i'm so sorry to hear that and i hope i hope everything's still fine

03:30:42.420 --> 03:30:51.620
though and you're still you know enjoying everything else about life i don't i i i have a really

03:30:51.620 --> 03:30:55.940
bad immune system but it's not outright outrageously bad

03:30:58.580 --> 03:31:04.900
i understand getting sick really easily and stuff because that happens to me but um

03:31:05.860 --> 03:31:08.260
ouch sorry i'm not really

03:31:11.060 --> 03:31:15.860
like needing safety measures for my health so

03:31:17.780 --> 03:31:22.020
uh just gotta be careful not to um fall

03:31:24.500 --> 03:31:26.740

03:31:35.460 --> 03:31:37.860

03:34:04.580 --> 03:34:11.700
peroxide in our ears to like soften up like wax and stuff and she'd clean our ears herself

03:34:12.260 --> 03:34:18.100
and we'd lay on her lap and put my head on her lap and she'd clean her ears

03:34:21.060 --> 03:34:23.860
so she'd use water and peroxide

03:34:26.660 --> 03:34:30.900
mostly peroxide i don't know if that was actually really safe to do though

03:34:31.380 --> 03:34:42.980
but the peroxide was always cold and when i went in the air i was like so tingly

03:34:43.860 --> 03:34:45.460
