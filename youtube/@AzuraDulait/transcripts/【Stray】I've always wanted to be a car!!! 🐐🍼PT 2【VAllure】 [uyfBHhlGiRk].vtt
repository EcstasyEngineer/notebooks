03:25.360 --> 03:27.360
Can you guys hear me?

03:27.360 --> 03:29.360
Can you hear me?

03:46.360 --> 03:48.360
I am.

03:49.360 --> 03:52.360
Hi hi.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.360
Hi.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.360
How are you?

04:08.360 --> 04:10.360
Hi hi.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.360
How are my babies?

04:14.360 --> 04:17.360
How are my sweet little bleeding hearts?

04:18.360 --> 04:20.360
How are you all?

04:44.360 --> 04:47.360
I am doing good.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.360
I am doing good.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.360
I am doing good.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.360
I am doing good.

04:56.360 --> 04:59.360
I am glad you are all doing really well.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.360
I am doing okay.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.360
I have some

05:07.360 --> 05:09.360
some things

05:09.360 --> 05:12.360
that we can talk about before we start.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.360
Okay?

05:17.360 --> 05:19.360
Oh wow!

05:19.360 --> 05:21.360
Welcome in Penpal.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.360
Hi Penpal.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.360
Thank you Emmy for the red.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.360
Welcome in everyone.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.360
How are you all?

05:34.360 --> 05:36.360
Hi hi.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.360
Hi hi.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.360
Hi hi. Welcome in. Welcome in.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.360
I hope your stream was really fun.

05:58.360 --> 06:02.360
I think it was your monetization stream.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.360
Monetization celebration.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.360
Congratulations.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.360
Congratulations Emmy. Yay.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.360
Hello.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.360
Thank you.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.360
Thank you thank you.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.360
Yeah it was super fun.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.360
I am glad you had fun!

06:33.360 --> 06:35.360
It's so good.

06:42.360 --> 07:06.360
While speaking of monetisation, though we'll probably have to wait a little longer, I'll have to take even extra steps to being a little more careful.

07:06.360 --> 07:21.360
That also includes no more singing on stream as well, so we've got to be careful.

07:21.360 --> 07:48.360
I got copyrighted by some fake singing for just acapella singing, which isn't because of just the copyright itself, it interferes with stuff.

07:48.360 --> 07:58.360
I got copyrighted three times.

07:58.360 --> 08:26.360
Youtube is strict against it, but they're also strict against the scammers, the fake people, copyrighting stuff that isn't actually theirs, so we'll just have to wait till things are safer, to start doing stuff again.

08:29.360 --> 08:33.360
Thank you so much for the 6th dollar, the beer.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.360
Otter.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.360
Biscotti?

08:41.360 --> 08:43.360
So you see your name?

08:43.360 --> 08:44.360
I think I butcher that.

08:44.360 --> 08:45.360
Like so bad.

08:45.360 --> 08:59.360
So I'll be even extra careful.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.360
Let me turn on my light.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.360
I just realised it's really dark.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.360
I head.

09:17.360 --> 09:42.360
I head.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.360
I head.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.360
Your tube.

09:49.360 --> 09:51.360
Your womb.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.360
Yeah, it's a little poopy, but it's our head.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.360
No worries.

09:55.360 --> 10:00.360
All we can do is continue streaming like normal.

10:00.360 --> 10:03.360
And enjoy us playing and stuff.

10:13.360 --> 10:18.360
I'm just at.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.360

thank you

12:58.760 --> 12:59.780
Thank you, appreciate you

13:01.720 --> 13:03.000
thank you, thank you

13:04.760 --> 13:06.920
Very sweet, and I appreciate all of you

13:08.940 --> 13:16.620
I am, thank you. I don't really know how to put into words my feelings. I'm really bad

13:17.980 --> 13:26.460
with expressing how I feel. So I just kind of just power through everything because that's what

13:26.460 --> 13:35.180
I'm used to doing. I'm not really good at emotions because I get really, really, really emotional

13:35.740 --> 13:40.140
and I get nervous and then I don't want to get nervous and then I'll freak out and then I'll cry

13:40.140 --> 13:50.300
and I'll be a baby and I want to be a baby. So you gotta be strong, me strong,

13:51.420 --> 13:57.500
mama strong because if mama isn't strong then who is gonna be strong?

13:57.500 --> 14:03.020
Mama has to be the strongest.

14:21.980 --> 14:26.540
Play league if you want to. That's okay. I want to play straight today.

14:27.260 --> 14:29.180
I really do. I want to play straight.

14:43.180 --> 14:44.860
Yeah, it's car simulator.

14:44.860 --> 14:49.020
Car simulator.

14:49.020 --> 15:17.740
Thank you. Thank you all for fun. I appreciate it so much. Thank you friends.

15:17.740 --> 15:24.540
That's $5 to pay. That's very sweet of you. I'm happy that you all stay and stick by me.

15:25.820 --> 15:30.220
I may not be doing so well and I may be like the extreme smallest.

15:35.580 --> 15:41.500
Thank you. I had hope so. I really do hope they do. Thank you Phoenix.

15:48.460 --> 15:57.900
Hang on.

16:00.700 --> 16:03.660
I feel like there was something else I was supposed to have mentioned. I completely

16:03.660 --> 16:18.620
forgot. Don't mind my heart rate. My heart rate is like crazy high. It's fine, okay?

16:20.700 --> 16:25.340
It's fine. Do not be concerned about it. It's perfectly fine.

16:25.340 --> 16:36.940
A combination of not really sleeping and I had a thought on my mind so I didn't really get much sleep.

16:38.860 --> 16:47.500
I tried but I couldn't so it's just not on my heart rate, okay? Okay, okay.

16:48.060 --> 16:58.540
I don't want you guys to constantly tell me to relax unless I really need to.

16:59.660 --> 17:06.780
I'll say so otherwise, okay? I don't want you guys to be worried. It makes me a little sad when you

17:06.780 --> 17:12.300
guys are extremely worried about me. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine, okay?

17:16.780 --> 17:17.180
All right.

17:21.820 --> 17:23.420
I would hope you would trust me.

17:28.220 --> 17:28.620
All right.

17:28.780 --> 17:36.220
Wow.

17:36.220 --> 17:38.760
Ndo.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.680
I didn't turn this on.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.540
Uh oh.

18:03.540 --> 18:13.540
Ie, we're fine. We're doing things.

18:43.540 --> 18:56.540
So, this is part two of stray. If you guys haven't seen the start stray yet, make sure you watch part one.

18:56.540 --> 19:13.540
So, remember to watch part one of this game session.

19:13.540 --> 19:19.540
Okay, so this is portal. We're continuing from the last stream.

19:19.540 --> 19:36.540
If you guys haven't already seen that, okay?

19:36.540 --> 20:04.540
Ie, hang on. That's very strange.

20:04.540 --> 20:18.540
It never did that before. Now it's doing it. That's really weird.

20:18.540 --> 20:25.540
Okay, that's fine, I guess. When I click off the video, the sound goes away.

20:26.540 --> 20:35.540
I want that to come back. How do you bring that back?

20:35.540 --> 20:42.540
I know some games have it, and I know some games don't.

20:42.540 --> 20:48.540
Oh, they have a thing where you can turn off and cap that.

20:48.540 --> 20:52.540
Oh, for the distance though.

20:52.540 --> 20:59.540
Oh, that's so cute.

20:59.540 --> 21:06.540
Pause on focus? Pause on focus? Where is that?

21:06.540 --> 21:17.540
This? No, that's not. That's not doing it either. It's so strange. Let me change the mode as well.

21:17.540 --> 21:23.540
So, I'm not super bright in your face.

21:24.540 --> 21:30.540
Dim lighting.

21:30.540 --> 21:36.540
Oh, wait. Am I supposed to go back and then do it, accept it, and then do it?

21:36.540 --> 21:57.540
No, that didn't work.

21:57.540 --> 22:02.540
Now this is definitely going to be the last, I think.

22:02.540 --> 22:09.540
I couldn't get through this. I promise. Watch me. I'm going to get straight through this game.

22:09.540 --> 22:15.540
This whole next part.

22:15.540 --> 22:20.540
Okay, give me one second.

22:45.540 --> 22:58.540
Okay.

22:58.540 --> 23:04.540
Right, we're on a rescue mission. This is where we last left off.

23:04.540 --> 23:19.540
On rescue mission.

23:19.540 --> 23:25.540
Look at all these zerk eggs. They will eat us. I can't do this.

23:25.540 --> 23:30.540
I'm not as fast as you. The zerk will get me for sure.

23:30.540 --> 23:39.540
Here, take this badge. My papa will recognise it. He will know that you're a friend.

23:39.540 --> 23:56.540
You don't know I don't. Open the door for you.

23:56.540 --> 24:08.540
Think shameless.

24:08.540 --> 24:15.540
This place is really nice, even though it's the slums. I don't know why. I really like it.

24:15.540 --> 24:24.540
Imagine if when this place was cleaned up, like super cleaned up and full of light.

24:24.540 --> 24:32.540
The only reason why it's falling apart is because people haven't been taken care of it, because they've been gone for hundreds of years.

24:32.540 --> 24:57.540
Imagine when this place was all cleaned up. It looked super nice.

24:57.540 --> 25:02.540
I don't like the music. It's making me nervous.

25:02.540 --> 25:10.540
Look at how huge this wall is.

25:10.540 --> 25:18.540
I remember it. It was a symbol of the division between those and the slums in the midtown.

25:18.540 --> 25:26.540
The fact that they kept throwing their garbage down here won't man.

25:26.540 --> 25:34.540
What a horrible thing to do. Maybe that's why they failed.

25:48.540 --> 26:09.540
Dead end. I'm so nervous. I'm so nervous.

26:10.540 --> 26:35.540
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

26:36.540 --> 26:44.540
I can't jump. No!

26:44.540 --> 26:51.540
I couldn't jump. It wouldn't let me jump. It didn't give me the option.

26:51.540 --> 26:53.540
That's so dumb.

27:21.540 --> 27:37.540
No, no, no, no, no!

27:37.540 --> 27:56.540
Now what? Oh, under!

27:56.540 --> 27:58.540
Mae'n siwet, mae'n siwet.

28:01.540 --> 28:02.540

29:22.540 --> 29:25.540

29:25.540 --> 29:27.540
Y Llywodraeth?

29:27.540 --> 29:29.540

29:46.540 --> 29:55.540
Y Llywodraeth nith var clarifywch.

29:55.540 --> 29:57.540
Y Llywodraeth...

29:58.540 --> 30:00.540
Y Llywodraeth?

30:00.540 --> 30:25.540
I can go that way. What's up here?

30:25.540 --> 30:42.540
There's two ways to go up here and then I can't come back down or over here.

30:42.540 --> 30:55.540
Well, a memory.

30:55.540 --> 31:07.540
The scientist I used to work for always said he wanted to retire to a little cottage fishing all day long.

31:07.540 --> 31:18.540
Of course, that was not a possibility in the city and nobody could have done that for at least hundreds of years.

31:18.540 --> 31:28.540
Let me get to the outside. We found ourselves a little cottage, the harmless fishing rod and a lot of books.

31:28.540 --> 31:42.540
I think that's what the scientist would have wanted. But first, we should go find out.

31:42.540 --> 32:09.540
I could not be here.

32:09.540 --> 32:38.540
Let's go find out.

32:39.540 --> 32:56.540
This is very relaxing. This comes my heart. I like this very much.

32:56.540 --> 33:11.540
Guys, how is the game audio so far by the way?

33:26.540 --> 33:39.540
It's fine. Audio is fine. Sounds good to me.

33:40.540 --> 33:58.540
That was a good little song. Time to go back on to our adventure. Nice relaxation time.

33:58.540 --> 34:18.540
Big stretch.

34:18.540 --> 34:38.540
You mean car? Clearly I'm a car. What do you mean?

34:49.540 --> 34:56.540
Obviously a car.

34:56.540 --> 35:08.540
I want to make sure everyone can still hear the game.

35:08.540 --> 35:30.540
What are we doing here? I'm assuming I have to go over there. Do I just jump over? Is there anything I have to do with this stuff here?

35:30.540 --> 35:46.540
I don't have anything. It's an electric generator. It seems to require some other part of function.

36:00.540 --> 36:16.540
It's all gloo-y out here.

36:30.540 --> 36:43.540
That was where I was just going to come either way. A window.

37:01.540 --> 37:18.540
Egg vincar.

37:18.540 --> 37:31.540
Why are the zircs so dirty?

37:48.540 --> 37:55.540
And two zircs. They mutated after the humans disappeared.

37:55.540 --> 38:07.540
So now they eat everything and anything. Even metal.

38:07.540 --> 38:13.540
Wait, you're in a house there. Who are you?

38:13.540 --> 38:23.540
That's my badge. You're wearing. How did you find it? Did my son send you? Oh, shameless. You clever boy.

38:23.540 --> 38:33.540
I've been here alone for ages. I came here to test the flux or what it didn't go as planned.

38:33.540 --> 38:41.540
I wish I could go back home. I miss my son dearly.

38:41.540 --> 38:59.540
You can have a lot around the house if you want, but I have no idea how to escape this place.

38:59.540 --> 39:07.540
Who is this?

39:07.540 --> 39:13.540
I've seen humans wear costumes like this.

39:13.540 --> 39:18.540
They were small and running around, making lots of noise. Children.

39:18.540 --> 39:27.540
Oh yes, I remember now. Yeah, they were children. The streets felt much more alive with them.

39:27.540 --> 39:42.540
Is their voice always like this? Yeah. I hope it doesn't bother you. I'm sorry.

39:42.540 --> 39:52.540
You want the difficulty they brought. You don't seem to love them very much.

39:52.540 --> 40:12.540
Is that the same thing? Seems like it.

40:12.540 --> 40:25.540
Wow.

40:25.540 --> 40:34.540
I'll stop. Oh, I cute.

40:34.540 --> 40:43.540
That's a bear.

40:43.540 --> 40:57.540
Sometimes she goes Bremlin and it's adorable. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm pretty old man.

40:57.540 --> 41:07.540
Hey, be careful with that defluxer. A full charge it can explode zirks like conferee.

41:07.540 --> 41:17.540
This baby needs 1.21 gigawatts to work. And the only thing around here with that kind of juice is the generator outside the house.

41:17.540 --> 41:24.540
The problem is that it won't start. I think a fuse blew.

41:24.540 --> 41:29.540
And with all the zirks around it's too dangerous for me to go out and fix it.

41:29.540 --> 41:40.540
I'm not fast enough, but you just might be. If you can reach the generator and replace the fuse, I should be able to get the defluxer recharged.

41:40.540 --> 41:55.540
Come on, follow me. I'll show you what they do.

41:55.540 --> 42:24.540
Is there anything else here?

42:25.540 --> 42:35.540
I just like jumping on things and destroying stuff. It's fun.

42:35.540 --> 42:47.540
I like the sliding doors.

42:48.540 --> 42:53.540
Here, it's like this fuse. It's brand new.

42:53.540 --> 42:58.540
Turning on the generator will be loud so expect some zirks.

42:58.540 --> 43:06.540
Once you fix the generator, I should be able to charge the end kickstart, the defluxer.

43:06.540 --> 43:16.540
You just need to follow this cable, change the fuse, then meet me back here.

43:16.540 --> 43:34.540
Cars have the biggest claws, did you know?

43:46.540 --> 44:07.540
May I sleep to your voice? Yeah, you can. Of course you can. That's perfectly fine.

44:38.540 --> 44:43.540
Is that it? Are you done? Is that over?

44:43.540 --> 44:57.540
Did I come back?

44:57.540 --> 45:07.540
I think that's it.

45:07.540 --> 45:20.540
Oh my God! Ah no!

45:20.540 --> 45:35.540
I didn't even see it though.

45:35.540 --> 45:47.540
Excited robot noises. Super excited robot noises.

45:47.540 --> 46:11.540
Amazing you got the generator back on. Yes!

46:11.540 --> 46:18.540
Have you seen how powerful the defluxer is? It's definitely our way out of here.

46:18.540 --> 46:25.540
Firstly, listening to your stream yesterday, already getting sleepy again. It's inevitable.

46:25.540 --> 46:36.540
Just accept your fate and fall asleep fall.

46:36.540 --> 47:00.540
Wait a minute, I might be able to mount this defluxer to your drone.

47:00.540 --> 47:07.540
It worked. The defluxer is now installed on your fancy drone here.

47:07.540 --> 47:14.540
It's not meant to run off such a small power source. If you use it too much, it cannot function.

47:14.540 --> 47:19.540
Just remember, it's dangerous. Now let's go back to the village.

47:19.540 --> 47:39.540
I'm coming home son. I'm coming home my baby. I'm coming home.

47:39.540 --> 47:51.540
How do you turn it on?

47:51.540 --> 47:57.540
I need to help Doc get back to the slums. I have to defluxer now.

47:57.540 --> 48:12.540
Oh, it's because I'm messing around. I'm sorry.

48:12.540 --> 48:21.540
Oh.

48:21.540 --> 48:28.540
Yeah, I'm aware. Take out all the zerk so we can get through.

48:28.540 --> 48:36.540
Oh. Wow, it's working great, but I was expecting it can overheat.

48:36.540 --> 48:44.540
Let it cool for a bit when that happens. I hope it will last until we reach the village.

48:44.540 --> 49:09.540
That's how you use it.

49:09.540 --> 49:23.540
That switch doesn't work. It looks like the electricity has been cut.

49:23.540 --> 49:42.540
There must be a way to open the door.

49:42.540 --> 49:55.540
Like this?

49:55.540 --> 50:04.540
Wait, I think I know.

50:04.540 --> 50:17.540
Like this? I'm smart. I'm so smart.

50:17.540 --> 50:34.540
I'm intelligent.

50:34.540 --> 50:46.540
Oh, hello.

51:04.540 --> 51:29.540
I like having a way to protect myself. I feel so much safer when I can kill things.

51:29.540 --> 51:38.540
Murdering things is fun. It's fine. In a game, of course. In a game.

51:38.540 --> 52:03.540
Oh. Run!

52:04.540 --> 52:08.540
That was close. Let's go back home.

52:08.540 --> 52:34.540
I'm on the door. He was dying.

52:34.540 --> 52:50.540
This looks so, like, interesting to live, you know? Like everywhere you go, there's probably, like, these are probably like storefronts or something. Homes. You'd pass by.

52:51.540 --> 53:03.540
I don't know why. I know inner city is definitely not good to live in, but it looks so fun.

53:03.540 --> 53:19.540
We're home.

53:20.540 --> 53:29.540
Hello.

53:29.540 --> 53:38.540
I found the sun. I heard.

53:38.540 --> 53:43.540
I go already am.

53:43.540 --> 53:50.540
Thanks for saving Doc, little friend. It's great to see the shame. This is no longer alone.

53:50.540 --> 54:04.540
Now we know that we can fight back against the Zergs. Mama has been waiting for you by the Zergs.

54:04.540 --> 54:15.540
Doc and Shamans look happy. I think we did a good thing together.

54:15.540 --> 54:28.540
Hey, Daddy. What's up, Rosie? Billy? You know my son, Shamans? It's thanks to him that I came back from that damn place.

54:28.540 --> 54:52.540
Yeah, sure. I thought happy is back. Aw. That's so sweet.

54:53.540 --> 55:12.540
Aw. No go. Did I do everything here? I think I did everything here. I have nothing else on my inventory.

55:12.540 --> 55:21.540
We ran out 51% through the game.

55:21.540 --> 55:36.540
It's time to move on. Hi. Mama was waiting for you on his boat. You can join him, but have you done everything you wanted here? I think so.

55:36.540 --> 55:48.540
I'll close the door behind you. Don't want any Zergs coming through. I think so, right? Was there anything else we needed to do?

55:48.540 --> 56:01.540
Hi there. Hi.

56:02.540 --> 56:11.540
The Fluxer is actually is really just a giant LED light. It's true. You will.

56:11.540 --> 56:19.540
Yeah, we're leaving. Well, we're going to go a little deeper, I think. We're going to go into the sewers next.

56:19.540 --> 56:26.540
I love this place. So nice.

56:50.540 --> 57:15.540
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

57:45.540 --> 57:47.540
I king!

57:47.540 --> 57:52.540
Was there even anyone in here? I remember scratching on the door. Surgery?

57:54.540 --> 57:56.540
Is that a robot doctor?

58:01.540 --> 58:05.540
I think we leave now. I don't think we have anything else to do here.

58:06.540 --> 58:08.540
I think we can go.

58:15.540 --> 58:17.540
Y, y, y.

58:17.540 --> 58:19.540
Y, y, y.

58:19.540 --> 58:21.540
Ysle. Ysle.

58:21.540 --> 58:23.540
Ysle.

58:23.540 --> 58:25.540
Y, y.

58:25.540 --> 58:27.540
Y, y.

58:29.540 --> 58:31.540
Oh.

58:33.540 --> 58:35.540
Ni.

58:41.540 --> 58:43.540
Ysle so nice.

58:45.540 --> 58:47.540
Ysle.

58:55.540 --> 58:57.540
Ysle.

58:57.540 --> 58:59.540
Ysle?

59:05.540 --> 59:07.540
Ysle?

59:07.540 --> 59:09.540
Ysle.

59:09.540 --> 59:11.540
Ysle.

59:11.540 --> 59:13.540
Ysle.

59:13.540 --> 59:33.060
I can't believe you fell back and got the defluxer with this now we can go find both

59:33.780 --> 59:42.580
Let's go. Let's go. Welcome everyone and anyone who's now joining in. It's good to have you.

59:45.300 --> 59:46.580
I hope that you'll have me.

59:46.580 --> 59:56.580
This is hilarious.

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.460
Are they a doctor or a mechanic?

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:13.460
Since the majority of them don't even know how to fix other machinery,

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:16.180
I'd say they are robot doctor.

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:33.460
Oh, I can zoom in.

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:43.460
This place is creepy.

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:15.460
I don't see any way to open this gate. Can you take a look on the other side?

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.460
Of course.

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:35.460
I don't like what I'm seeing over there.

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:45.460
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:25.460
Disgusting. I sneezed. Did I sneeze? I didn't even notice, but I actually sneezed.

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:41.460
It's all icky, sticky, squelchy. Thank you.

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:51.460
Thank you.

01:02:55.460 --> 01:03:01.460
I've never been this far out of the slums with you here. I'm not even scared.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:09.460
Are you guys not scared with me here?

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:13.460
Are you guys not scared?

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.460
They're watching us.

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:21.460
Look at it. It's watching us.

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:31.460
Are you guys not scared?

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:41.460
Are you guys not scared?

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:51.460
I'm not scared at all.

01:03:51.460 --> 01:04:01.460
I'm not scared at all.

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:11.460
Are you guys not scared?

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:39.460
All this old machinery is broken now. I think we can only open it manually.

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:49.460
Are you guys not scared?

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:59.460
Are you guys scared?

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:17.460
Quick. Jump below the door. It won't hold for long.

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:23.460
I got it. I'm going.

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:29.460
I can't go with you, but I won't stop looking for a way.

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:39.460
We better not. I don't want to leave Momo.

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:57.460
We're leaving you?

01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:09.460
He wouldn't have made it in here anyways.

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:23.460
Oh my gosh.

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:49.460
Oh no, there's a robot.

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:59.460
Oh.

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:27.460
Oh no.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:53.460
I'm not taking chances. I'm still scared.

01:07:53.460 --> 01:08:19.460
Oh my gosh.

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:31.460
I mean I can't go that way. What's over here? There's something over here?

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:41.460
A memory.

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:53.460
The sewer system. Yes, I remember now. Clean water was scarce.

01:08:53.460 --> 01:09:01.460
The city was supplied by a huge machinery that dug deep into the earth.

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:09.460
It was like everything else. It was rationed out to sustain people.

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:13.460
Oh my gosh. My brain is lagging.

01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:25.460
Just like everything else, it was rationed out to sustain people during times of drought.

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:33.460
Oh boy.

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:37.460
Dyslexia is hitting me really hard right now.

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:45.460
Give me one second.

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:55.460
I can read.

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:59.460
The scientists showed me the blueprint of the water tanks.

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:11.460
They are huge and contain a whole building in them.

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:33.460
Is there anything else? No.

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:57.460
Oh.

01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:05.460
Okay.

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:23.460
Is there any other memories? I don't want to miss a memory. No. Here.

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:27.460
It's so dangerous.

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:45.460
Can you cast a break out? I would be traumatized after dealing with pipes.

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:57.460
Oh boy.

01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:03.460
So so. Thank you mom and mister Vondella to be.

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:13.460
If you're looking for praise. You've all been very, very good for me.

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:39.460
Good baby crabs. My sweet little things.

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:49.460
Can I just go this way? Can I just avoid them?

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:59.460
Oh oh oh shit.

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:09.460
I have to clear them out one by one.

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:19.460
Okay.

01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:49.460
Okay.

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:59.460
Are you fine?

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:39.460
Get off me.

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:49.460
Get off me.

01:14:49.460 --> 01:15:13.460
Oh no.

01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:21.460
What is this place? This looks extremely creepy.

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:35.460
Am I missing something? Am I missing something?

01:15:35.460 --> 01:16:01.460
I'm so scared. I'm procrastinating because I don't want to go home.

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:11.460
Can you avoid some of those? There's a lot of eggs. I can avoid some of the eggs. Probably not all of them because loud noises activate them.

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:25.460
So if I would have left a majority of those eggs out and then hit that lever, all of them probably would have been activated along with the ones coming out of the door.

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:35.460
And they also activate when you get really close to them.

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:53.460
What the fuck?

01:16:53.460 --> 01:17:03.460
Ah! Ah! Ah!

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:33.460
Oh shit!

01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:51.460
Can I just run? Oh there's too many. This is so dangerous.

01:17:51.460 --> 01:18:01.460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:11.460
Can I just go?

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:31.460
Oh my god. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:40.460
OK. You're OK.

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:57.460
All of those terrifying.

01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:15.460
Hold on.

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:44.460
Are they closed?

01:19:44.460 --> 01:20:13.460
Uh-oh.

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:24.460
Oh.

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:52.460
Oh no. Oh no. I walk them up, I walk them up, I walk them up. I walk them up, I walk them up, I walk them up.

I don't like this

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:13.240
I don't like this at all

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:01.240
you think he would have survived this?

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.240
if Momo came with us

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:05.240
you think Momo would have survived?

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.240
come on

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.240
I don't want to do this

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:21.240

No! No! No! No!

Go, go, go, go!

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.640
It's closing! It's closing!

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:42.040
I made it.

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:47.880
Oh, wake up!

01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:50.680
Wake up!

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:52.680
Oh, okay.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:26:00.360
It was dark. I was alone. I felt like I was back in the network.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.360
But you saved me. Thank you, friend.

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:13.880
During that month, power was rough on my core.

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:19.880
But the fluxer is completely destroyed now. I have to be careful.

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.880
No.

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:29.880
The fluxer was what made me brave without it. I am nothing.

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.880
Was there anything else?

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:01.880
So much water. So much wet.

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:15.880
I made it.

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:19.880
I'm here. Did I miss a memory?

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.880
I think I missed a memory.

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:25.880
I made it.

01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:27.880
Traveller from the sewers.

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.880
I made it.

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.880
I made it.

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.880
I made it.

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:39.880
I made it.

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.880
I made it.

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:43.880
Traveller from the sewers.

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.880
I want to see one of you in ages.

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:49.880
Are you the one who contacted us earlier?

01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.880
A little outsider?

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:55.880
Balsahar, the outsider, has been expecting you.

01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:59.880
He's meditating at the top of our village.

01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:01.880
Thank you.

01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:03.880
Baladan.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:07.880
Ant village. I think I missed a memory.

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.880
Let me see.

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.880
No.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:17.880
I missed a memory.

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.880
Oh no.

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:27.880
I missed a memory.

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:29.880
I wonder what that memory was.

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:39.880
Oh, hang on.

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:47.080
ond? I'm not moving on. I think this crashed.

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:57.080
Yeah, this crashed. Give me one second.

01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:11.880
I'm not moving on. I think this crashed. Give me one second.

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:25.880
Wow, hello. It's me. Mario.

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:31.880
Okay.

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:55.880
My only weapon is gone, you know? This machine, the scientist, has introduced one of the others.

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:03.880
He was sick. This was his last hope. He walked into the machine.

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:09.880
But I wasn't with him. He was alone. What was he doing?

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:19.880
Isn't that the machine that was in the room when we first got B12?

01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:29.880
He uploaded himself into the computer and everything was different.

01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:43.880
But the upload something went wrong. He was stuck for hundreds of years until a little cat appeared.

01:30:49.880 --> 01:31:01.880
Was it? It was me. I was the scientist. I was human.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:07.880
I need a moment.

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:19.880
Oh no. Oh no.

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:38.880
I'm sorry. I need a moment. I don't feel like talking right now.

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:49.880
Oh, that's understandable. Go ahead. We just look around. Something scratch.

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:16.880
I get an achievement for that.

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:18.880
I'm a tree.

01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:49.880
I'm a tree.

01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:55.880
I'm a tree.

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:06.880
I'm a tree.

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:25.880
What else have I forgotten?

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:31.880
Unless I've had parents, friends. What happened to everyone?

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:39.880
I wanted to open the city, but is there even anyone left to say?

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:49.880
It's over here.

01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:59.880
That's where I came from.

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:04.880
Up up below.

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:26.880
I blushed. Wait, I sneezed again? When did I sneeze? What? I don't... How come I never remember?

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:32.880
I don't remember sneezing. What is this?

01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:36.880
I really sneezed.

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.880
Thank you.

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:49.880
Thank you.

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:07.880
I gotta need a scratchy.

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:18.880
I'm hungry.

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:36.880
I'm hungry. Why? I'm hungry. Why? Why?

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:38.880
I'm hungry.

01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:48.880
Toast time. I want toast. I gotta go get bread though.

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.880
I'll get it after.

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:58.880
I'll get an orange. I don't have an orange.

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:04.880
What is this?

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:08.880
I'll get an orange.

01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.880
My balls are hard.

01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:30.880
Hey, don't you know not to interrupt a fellow during his transcendental meditation?

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:41.880
Oh, it's you. You were with Momo when we received a call earlier. I'm glad to meet you at last little outsider.

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:53.880
You know Momo and Doc, so you're already familiar with those outsiders. I miss them, and memory brings me peace.

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:11.880
Momo slyt, Momo staed yn y slums. I heard you helped find Doc in Clementine. She's in Midtown now.

01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:21.880
If you still want to see the outside, she's the one who can get you there. Apparently she had some kind of plan to leave the city.

01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:33.880
Here, take this. This is meaning you can never leave or her address in the back of this picture. Clementine's picture.

01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:51.880
Come in a new item. To reach in Midtown, climb up our little village. It should be easy for a Dick Styrious, one like you.

01:37:51.880 --> 01:38:02.880
If you manage to reach the outside, you will be the very first. I would wish you good luck, but you don't need it. I believe in you.

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:10.880
He believes in me. Yeah.

01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:26.880
If you had to pick one Pokemon as your partner, what would it be? Either Weed Cat or Lovatar. I really like Lovatar. I have a Lovatar stuffy.

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:36.880
Lovatar.

01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:45.880
Weed Cat or Lovatar. Lovatar.

01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:54.880
Or any of the Eevee evolutions.

01:38:54.880 --> 01:39:13.880
Especially the grass evolution of Eevee. It's my favorite evolution. It doesn't get much love, but I love it.

01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:38.880
Leafeon. Yeah, Leafeon.

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:55.880
Sorry, sorry.

01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:15.880
Did you know that Vaporeon is... Don't start with that here, alright? Don't start with that.

01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:23.880
Don't start. I'm giving my eye on you.

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:33.880
Good night Azura. I hope you have fun. Good night to you too. Have a good night.

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:59.880
Mum.

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:09.880
I love Peter. I can't stop hearing him. Oh my gosh.

01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:39.880
No.

01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:18.880
Hang on. Give me a second.

01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:28.880
I'm not falling asleep, I swear.

01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:41.880
I'm not falling asleep. I'm looking at pizza.

01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:25.880
I'm not falling asleep.

01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:43.880
Let me stretch.

01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:53.880
The eapiness is starting to hit me.

01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:42.880
I'm getting pizza.

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:57.880
Yeah, we ordered a pizza.

01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:06.880
Guys, I'm already done, so please get yourself a snack, water or something to drink. Get a blankie and get comfy.

01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:15.880
Mine will probably take time to get here, but I'm going to get it.

01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:22.880
I really shouldn't, but I've been craving a pizza for like two weeks.

01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:37.880
I've been craving pizza since before they built when we were chatting about pizza in the chat. I still haven't forgotten.

01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:52.880
I haven't had pizza since then. Even before that. I haven't had pizza in a long time.

01:46:52.880 --> 01:47:02.880
Pizza is very expensive over here. It's very expensive.

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:21.880
It's fine. You don't worry about it. It's fine.

01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:31.880
Let me put this in the way you keep playing.

01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:54.880
It's fine.

01:47:54.880 --> 01:48:14.880
No, it's a bad drink.

01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:44.880
It's fine.

01:48:44.880 --> 01:49:10.880
No break.

01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:27.880
Let me grab this.

01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:37.880
Oh my God, I am a river. You don't have to do that. Thank you. Thank you for the 30. Thank you.

01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:45.880
You're insane. Thank you.

01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:17.880
Thank you.

01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:49.880
Oh, how cute. My legs are, I feel like jelly. It was sitting for so long.

01:50:49.880 --> 01:51:06.880
Okay.

01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:15.880
Is it an honor? Is it an honor for you?

01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:25.880
First week young ladies will, that's so sweet of you. Oh my God. That's so very sweet of you. Thank you.

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:37.880
Thank you. Thank you. Let's continue with the game while we wait for foods to come.

01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:47.880
Let me take another small break.

01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:53.880
Where is the cave? Sorry for shutting down earlier.

01:51:53.880 --> 01:52:02.880
I'm human, probably the last in the world. Now it was left to me.

01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:10.880
So much has come back to me. How much have I forgotten?

01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:22.880
Maybe if we find something, we can restore my memories and get you back home at the same time.

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:33.880
So we can go back down and find out more, the companions are head onward to Mattel.

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:38.880
You should go find Clementine. Oh, nothing has happened to her.

01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:44.880
Clementine at the top of our village and find a path to reach Mattel.

01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:54.880
But before we do that, we're going to have a look around.

01:52:54.880 --> 01:53:00.880
Oh, I want to go down. I want to go down. I want to look around for us.

01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:10.880
Now we can talk to people, I think.

01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:17.880
This food is actually horrible, but it's the only thing around.

01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:31.880
I'll have to unscrew my front casing if I keep eating this trash.

01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:42.880
Maybe I should open my own place because I really can't get any worse than that.

01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:52.880
A GPU done, all you can eat buffet. Imagine that. I can eat that stuff forever.

01:53:53.880 --> 01:54:05.880
People call me the Teng Chef. I specialize in upcycling leftovers.

01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:14.880
Raman. Raman C45. That's my secret ingredient.

01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:32.880
Who told you about the secret ingredient?

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:41.880
It's a kitchen.

01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:46.880
Can I go down there? I can.

01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:50.880
Mine. Thanks.

01:54:50.880 --> 01:55:11.880
Flower.

01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:20.880
Where's the stove?

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:31.880
It's a cute little area to lay down.

01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:39.880
It's another one of those spots.

01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:53.880
Raman. Raman GPU done.

01:55:53.880 --> 01:56:00.880
I've only ever had udon once, but I didn't have all the other stuff in it. It was just the noodles.

01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:17.880
I've only had udon noodles. I haven't had the other stuff they put in it.

01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:28.880
I can't eat pre-packaged ramen noodles because it messes with my stomach for some reason.

01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:36.880
My stomach can't digest the packaged ramen, so I end up like it comes back up after like 10 minutes.

01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:46.880
I can not even very long. It hurts. It makes my tummy hurt a lot.

01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:57.880
So I can only eat actual freshly cooked ramen.

01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:04.880
I used to eat at a certain place.

01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:10.880
They make the best ramen. It tastes so good.

01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:16.880
It's the only place that I can actually stomach eating it.

01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:26.880
Other than that, I can't stomach anything else.

01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:46.880
Raman. Raman.

01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:58.880
We don't have many Raman places that are made traditionally.

01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:07.880
There are people who are learning how to make it, but they are making it.

01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:11.880
It doesn't taste good.

01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:17.880
It doesn't taste very good. It doesn't taste like traditional ramen at all.

01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:26.880
That's why there's only so many places that I will go to to make ramen really good, in my opinion.

01:58:41.880 --> 01:59:03.880
Raman. Raman.

01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:18.880
Yeah. It isn't many places.

01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:22.880
I have a car too.

01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:28.880
One thing I don't like about my city is that there are no dedicated ramen places.

01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:33.880
What are they about to see in the world though?

01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:38.880
Or soba. I like yaki soba.

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:42.880
But I think that's the only packaged one that I can eat.

01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:46.880
I can eat packaged yaki soba.

01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:50.880
I think it's made very differently.

01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:54.880
I can eat that and it tastes so good.

01:59:54.880 --> 02:00:09.880
I wish I had the one I could tell you.

02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:19.880
Zori reviews.

02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:25.880
I got a few very few ramen places around here, but they're just okay, sadly.

02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:35.880
This is a way of life.

02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:39.880
I have a few sushi places. We have everything.

02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:45.880
I wish we had more.

02:00:45.880 --> 02:01:04.880
More Asian cuisine.

02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:09.880
Oh hello there. It has been so long since we've had a visitor.

02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:12.880
We'll accept those dimsirks of course.

02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:17.880
Imagine if we could harness their power.

02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:20.880
Have them run in a wheel or something.

02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:26.880
Just to waste the potential.

02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:33.880
When I grow up, I want to be great like Aunt Clementine.

02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:37.880
I look so new.

02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:42.880
I look like such a new robot.

02:01:42.880 --> 02:02:02.880
I wanted to explore like she did, but the grown-ups verbatised the antithlet.

02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:17.880
Is there anything else around here?

02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:27.880
Zia's electric zerk everywhere.

02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:49.880
Why don't you wake up?

02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:55.880
We have a lot of robots that are pretty rusty.

02:02:55.880 --> 02:03:02.880
All the old robots are kind of rusty.

02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:06.880
They have a little bit of rust on them.

02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:15.880
In this language, a companion robot made it up from scratch. How impressive.

02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:19.880
I remember it happening when I was in the network.

02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:29.880
I don't know when exactly, but at one time all the communications started to switch to the symbols.

02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:34.880
I was stuck in a computer and alone for a long time.

02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:41.880
So I translated every symbol in word one by one until I was able to understand everything.

02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:49.880
Now that I'm out, I know their language. I'm curious to hear all they have to say.

02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:57.880
I hate that gap. I can't believe I missed a memory.

02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:27.880
Does this wake them up?

02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:57.880
The painter.

02:04:57.880 --> 02:05:07.880
Mae. Do you know there are more than 900 sads of white pant?

02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:26.880
I don't tell anyone, but I'm creating my own shade of pant.

02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:31.880
I'm calling it garbage brown.

02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:36.880
Ew. White garbage brown.

02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:40.880
Hang on, this is a door. I'll be right back.

02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:44.880
Robot. Robot, robot.

02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:12.880
Robot. Robot.

02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:14.880

02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:31.960
Ydw.

02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:52.600
Can we just say a math is officially not my forte I cannot do math do not expect me to do math

02:09:52.600 --> 02:10:08.600
I cannot do math I cannot do math

02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:22.600
I cannot do math I cannot do math I cannot do math I cannot do math

02:10:38.600 --> 02:11:04.600
2 x 4 is 8, that's easy

One of my favorite colors.

02:16:25.480 --> 02:16:31.880
I was a bellbut many cycles ago but I repurposed myself into a treasure hunter.

02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:40.200
Don't be fooled by the sound of it. It can be hard and gruesome just like this arm I just found.

02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:47.640
Oh, I mean they lost an arm. Oh, they did. They found a new arm.

02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:52.280
For a fellow may he rest in peace.

02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:06.120
Isn't it like lavender? Yeah, it's called periwinkle.

02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:16.440
It's a color that tricks you. It's my favorite color that tricks you in the spectrum because it looks like it's purple, but it's actually blue.

02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:34.840
It's my favorite color.

02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:36.840
I love the color.

02:17:55.320 --> 02:17:58.760
Is that what I call a junk? I call it treasure.

02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:09.240
Yeah, it's one of my favorite, favorite colors. I like baby colors like baby blue,

02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:19.400
yellow, but really, really light yellow, orange, but super light. I like the little baby color spectrum.

02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:23.800
It's my favorite.

02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:28.520
It's gay, can I? Do I just go back the same way?

02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:41.560
This way.

02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:53.080
Indeed. Sorry for leaving early again. Oh, that's okay. Don't worry about it.

02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:59.400

Hello, I'll call her. Thanks buddy.

02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:05.040
You got any other one for me please? Please?

02:31:06.560 --> 02:31:08.800
Oh wow, you're so pretty. Thank you.

02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:13.120
Can you find me another one for me? Please? Please?

02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:16.560
Hi, hello. Welcome then. Hi.

02:31:17.440 --> 02:31:18.240
How are you?

02:31:20.480 --> 02:31:23.600
Oh, I heard it's a rare plant. Thank you.

02:31:24.400 --> 02:31:28.960
Bona mam. Thank you so much here as a reward to my badge.

02:31:34.880 --> 02:31:41.280
It looks so good. It looks so good with it. It looks, it looks, it looks.

02:31:46.480 --> 02:31:51.600
Not you, but it as in like the thingy that's on my back. It looks so good with it.

02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:54.960
All right. I'll take care now. I'll see you friend.

02:32:11.680 --> 02:32:18.240
I'm bored. I'm claiming that I used the whole classes here so you learn a lot of cool stuff.

02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:28.960
It's like a little classroom. That's so cute.

02:32:52.400 --> 02:33:03.360
Oh. Wait, am I supposed to jump on that?

02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:10.960
No? Oh. It just took me all the way back. No.

02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:19.120
I'll go back up.

02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:37.760
Only up, only up. Wait, can I knock these over? Oh.

02:33:39.120 --> 02:33:44.400
I want to knock those over. Do you want to jump over there? I can't.

02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:48.560
Is it? It's a second.

02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:30.560
You guys see uncle and son? Can you tell me that everyone's a sister? Sure. You can do that.

02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:40.000
Up to daisy, up to daisy.

02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:48.000
I feel like I'm forgetting something. Is there memory that I forgot about? No, I think there's only one.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:35:03.440
I go up here.

02:35:03.440 --> 02:35:20.880
It looks like the sun up there, but you know it's not. Fake white lights.

02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:27.680
Is it normal for a cat to be obsessed with socks?

02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:31.120
I suppose so.

02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:39.280
I know my cat used to be obsessed with my shoes.

02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:45.120
He'd lay on my shoes all the time.

02:35:57.680 --> 02:36:15.120
I'm sorry for a fourth size of pizza. I'm having a fourth slice. This kills me.

02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:25.040
I'm going to drink.

02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:42.560
You like seafood?

02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:52.000
You like seafood?

02:36:52.000 --> 02:37:09.440
You do? You do like seafood?

02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:20.880
You do? You do like seafood?

02:37:39.440 --> 02:38:08.880
No, I spilled it everywhere. No, my blanket.

02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:12.480
No, I got to suck it out of the blanket.

02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:30.880
No, it's all wet.

02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:52.320
I'm back. You're all no fun.

02:38:52.320 --> 02:39:02.400
I like the little detail of the tail sticking up.

02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:08.880
The tail sticking up literally for a cat is a greeting, by the way.

02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:13.360
When a cat's tail sticks up, it's literally saying hello.

02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:21.440
So every time robot comes out, the tail sticks up. I think that's so cute. Such a cute detail.

02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:28.160
No manners.

02:39:32.720 --> 02:39:34.400
I don't know what you're talking about.

02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:51.200
I completely forgotten this kind of transportation existence.

02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:56.960
You can ride anywhere in the city. People used to take it to go to work.

02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:02.400
I used to take it too. Every morning after saying goodbye to my family at home.

02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:12.240
I remember I was doing this for them. They were gone now. It was a long ago.

02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:19.360
You wanted to see the outside, but does that even matter anymore?

02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:22.800
What happened to them? What happened to everyone?

02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:33.760
Anyway, we're near Mitano. Let's find this Clementine.

02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:41.520
We can have a picture of her. We have a picture of her.

02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:48.640
We can show it so some of the companions are on here. Maybe they'll point us in the right direction.

02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:59.600
Make your memory.

02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:15.600
That's a transdation.

02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:27.600
That's a transdation.

02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:42.560
I don't know what to say.

02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:48.560
I don't know what to say.

02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:52.560
Translay it.

02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:58.080
Clothes due to pandemic restrictions, please do not enter.

02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:02.160
Any violations of rules can result heavy prison sentence.

02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:06.160
Were the people in the lower section sick?

02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:13.520
Were they sick?

02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:19.520
I remember.

02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:26.880
There's so many books here.

02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:34.640
Deterian, test legacy, the ethics of artificial intelligence.

02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:39.840
I recognise some of these books. I have a library.

02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:45.040
I remember nothing was quiet like the smell of books in the turn of payage.

02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:47.920
It was a feeling almost like comfort.

02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:56.880
A book was like spending time with someone.

02:42:56.880 --> 02:43:10.880
Miao. Miao. Miao. Miao. Miao. Miao.

02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:13.680
Hee hee. What a cute face.

02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:21.840
Lidoc.

02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:35.840
I know something.

02:43:40.880 --> 02:43:51.840
I don't know what to say.

02:43:51.840 --> 02:44:01.840
I don't know what to say.

02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:12.800
I don't know what to say.

02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:25.200
Translation wanted.

02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:30.800
Clementine, trouble maker, outsider, rebellious, please report any sightings.

02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:32.800
Yeah.

02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:36.000
I told you five times.

02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:39.280
You can't run around like that.

02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:40.240
It's dangerous.

02:44:41.680 --> 02:44:44.960
Hey, this is the first time I've seen this kind of robot.

02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:46.080
He looks so fluffy.

02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:52.640
Oh, it's the girl displayed on this one screen, right?

02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:54.720
You should ask somebody else.

02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:57.440
I'm just busy with yours here to know anything.

02:45:02.640 --> 02:45:04.000
No, I already read that.

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.720
Oh, can I talk to the little guy?

02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:08.880
Little guy?

02:45:08.880 --> 02:45:09.120
No.

02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:15.520
Don't worry about trash.

02:45:15.520 --> 02:45:18.160
Nicocorporatio takes care of everything.

02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:19.680
They didn't take care of anything.

02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:20.800
Ruh.

02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:31.280
Oh.

02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:35.280
Is there another?

02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:47.760
I arrest them.

02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:49.760
What's this?

02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:55.760
Access to lower level is restricted due to organic life hazards.

02:45:55.760 --> 02:45:57.760
Please keep out of this area.

02:45:57.760 --> 02:45:59.360
I closed the elevator.

02:45:59.360 --> 02:46:02.240
This is the elevator that leads down below, isn't it?

02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:15.200
Well, yeah, look.

02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:19.200
I'm right below inside the elevator.

02:46:21.120 --> 02:46:21.840
It's dumb.

02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:22.880
It's the town.

02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:31.360
They're down there.

02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:35.360
Hee.

02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:39.360
Do you hear that down below?

02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:42.160
That ebb, that flow?

02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:44.160
Is that he haunts me?

02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:45.360
It haunts me?

02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:46.560
I don't hear that.

02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:48.160
I don't hear that.

02:46:48.160 --> 02:46:49.440
I don't hear that.

02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:50.560
I don't hear that.

02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:51.440
City haunts me?

02:46:51.440 --> 02:46:52.240
It haunts me?

02:46:54.480 --> 02:46:54.960
Probably.

02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:00.320
Caz buzzed for an only sad.

02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:01.280
Why is he sad?

02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:04.160
Won't he sad?

02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:09.520
Pan a team up for that.

02:47:14.640 --> 02:47:19.600
That trash, that trash city blast is no joke.

02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:24.960
EverydayNekoCorp is doing this relentless work on me.

02:47:27.440 --> 02:47:28.720
Oh, Clementine?

02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:30.160
Yeah, I used to hang out with her.

02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:31.840
She wanted to live.

02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:35.520
She was a breeze and then she flew.

02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:37.760
She's a wanted person now.

02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:39.680
I'm too heavy for me.

02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:41.840
Hear that?

02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:44.320
That ebb, that flow?

02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:52.560
I don't hear that.

02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:08.000
How did I get over here?

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:09.280
Oh, what's over there?

02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:22.640
Did I hear that?

02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:41.760
It's the transmitter tower over there.

02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:43.760
That's where I turned on the power.

02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:54.560

02:50:01.580 --> 02:50:03.580
.. it's very creepy music

02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:46.840
I don't know the jingle started to remind me of Undertale, this is now sort of reminding

02:50:46.840 --> 02:51:08.240
of Undertale, there's a tiny bit, some of the parts of the jingle, this is the tale with

02:51:08.240 --> 02:51:34.160
underground, well you are underground, top of fucks, doesn't know how to say that word, I won't even try.

02:51:38.240 --> 02:52:06.640
Resting in this barren city fills you with determination,

02:52:06.640 --> 02:52:29.760
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

02:52:29.760 --> 02:52:52.880

Excuse me?

02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:55.560
Drilling nothing over here?

02:57:55.560 --> 02:58:01.560
There's something supposed to be over here?

02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:08.560
I'm a little confused.

02:58:10.560 --> 02:58:12.560
There's a bunch of boxes to jump on.

02:58:19.560 --> 02:58:23.560
Please state your identity as a peacemaker.

02:58:26.560 --> 02:58:35.560
Co-operate, or we will have to transfer you to jail and reboot you.

02:58:38.560 --> 02:58:41.560
Please leave me alone. I'm not the one you're looking for.

02:58:44.560 --> 02:58:48.560
If you're looking for Clement Simon, I'm sure she's hiding in the residence.

02:58:55.560 --> 02:58:59.560
Midtown, this looks so cool.

02:58:59.560 --> 02:59:00.560
This is what I mean.

02:59:00.560 --> 02:59:04.560
This is what I mean by living in a place like this.

02:59:04.560 --> 02:59:05.560
Looks really cool.

02:59:05.560 --> 02:59:06.560
Doesn't it?

02:59:08.560 --> 02:59:10.560
This looks so cool.

02:59:13.560 --> 02:59:14.560
I.

02:59:14.560 --> 02:59:28.560
Consider this tomorrow if I replace my arm with another robotic arm.

02:59:28.560 --> 02:59:31.560
Then the next day my other arm too.

02:59:31.560 --> 02:59:36.560
Then my body and so on until I replace all my parts and upgrade my software.

02:59:36.560 --> 02:59:39.560
Will I be the same robot you're talking to now?

02:59:39.560 --> 02:59:43.560
If you maintain the same memory as I think so.

02:59:44.560 --> 02:59:47.560
Oh hey, what are you showing me right now?

02:59:48.560 --> 02:59:50.560
A bunch of people I don't know.

02:59:50.560 --> 02:59:55.560
My guess is that they probably live in the massive housing building further uptown.

02:59:56.560 --> 02:59:58.560
Do what you want with that.

03:00:00.560 --> 03:00:03.560
Thanks, Mr. Bloody.

03:00:06.560 --> 03:00:08.560
Destruction.

03:00:09.560 --> 03:00:12.560
Destruction, no.

03:00:14.560 --> 03:00:16.560
Something else in here.

03:00:17.560 --> 03:00:19.560
Meow.

03:00:41.560 --> 03:00:43.560
Wonton ni ar?

03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:53.560
Hey, I'm off to work. See you later.

03:00:53.560 --> 03:00:57.560
Okay honey, be cautious of sentinels.

03:00:57.560 --> 03:01:02.560
They're quite, they're quick to make a rest for no reason, for no good reason.

03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:05.560
Don't worry about me, babe, I'm good.

03:01:17.560 --> 03:01:19.560
Hello.

03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:24.560
Gray.

03:01:24.560 --> 03:01:30.560
At Nygle Corp, we work all day long together the ways and send it downstairs,

03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:33.560
where they recycle and repurpose it.

03:01:35.560 --> 03:01:41.560
Speaking of downstairs, it has been a while since we had news from them.

03:01:42.560 --> 03:01:45.560
We'll picture that one.

03:01:45.560 --> 03:01:48.560
Hey, is that an address on the back?

03:01:48.560 --> 03:01:54.560
First symbol is the street, and then there is a floor and a door number.

03:01:54.560 --> 03:01:56.560
It's gonna be easy to find.

03:01:56.560 --> 03:01:58.560
Ready?

03:01:58.560 --> 03:02:00.560
How do you...

03:02:02.560 --> 03:02:04.560
Uh, examine.

03:02:05.560 --> 03:02:07.560
Oh.

03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:09.560
Oh.

03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:13.560
They said a...

03:02:13.560 --> 03:02:15.560
Come on, I can do this.

03:02:15.560 --> 03:02:17.560
Ha ha.

03:02:17.560 --> 03:02:21.560
A street, a street door number, and then what?

03:02:21.560 --> 03:02:23.560
What was it?

03:02:29.560 --> 03:02:33.560
Whatever that symbol is, three five?

03:02:37.560 --> 03:02:39.560
Floor.

03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:44.560
Flo.

03:02:45.560 --> 03:02:48.560
Sorry, little one, you can't play over here.

03:02:51.560 --> 03:02:56.560
The Nygle Corp factory is no place for a little fussball idea.

03:02:56.560 --> 03:03:02.560
Access is restricted, but only for a little while.

03:03:02.560 --> 03:03:07.560
If you can wait a few years, we'll open right back up.

03:03:07.560 --> 03:03:10.560
Wait, I didn't show in the picture.

03:03:12.560 --> 03:03:15.560
Cool picture, is that address on the back?

03:03:15.560 --> 03:03:18.560
Oh, you're just gonna tell me the same thing.

03:03:19.560 --> 03:03:21.560
Ha ha.

03:03:44.560 --> 03:03:46.560
D感謝 wel yn cael ei gael.

03:03:46.560 --> 03:03:58.560

03:03:58.560 --> 03:04:02.560
I hide the

03:04:02.560 --> 03:04:10.560
I hide the

03:04:10.700 --> 03:04:12.300

03:04:37.460 --> 03:04:58.060
Hi. Clubs closed. Get lost? Oh yeah? Who are you? Police? Everyone's looking for her.

03:04:58.060 --> 03:05:03.060
I'll let her in if that's what you want to know.

03:05:07.060 --> 03:05:09.060
Ooh, what's down there?

03:05:12.060 --> 03:05:16.060
This merchant crook sold me a faulty battery the other day.

03:05:17.060 --> 03:05:22.060
Now he just prisions not to hear me. Every time I try to confront him.

03:05:22.060 --> 03:05:28.060
If he wasn't for the Sentinel on patrol he'd end up a spare part.

03:05:34.060 --> 03:05:39.060
I don't think he has any. I think he needs to be charged.

03:05:46.060 --> 03:05:47.060
Translate.

03:05:47.060 --> 03:06:00.060
Code is a 2458 or 8542. 2458 or 8542. Looks like it's backwards.

03:06:03.060 --> 03:06:06.060
Tiaw, remember that? You guys are smart.

03:06:07.060 --> 03:06:13.060
Oh wait, it's this. What was it? What was it again?

03:06:13.060 --> 03:06:14.060
Again?

03:06:25.060 --> 03:06:27.060
458? Oh.

03:06:27.060 --> 03:06:42.060
That didn't work. 22548. 22548. Nope, that didn't work.

03:06:43.060 --> 03:06:58.060
8458. Oh, wait. Not in the dictionary.

03:06:59.060 --> 03:07:12.060
8452? Oh. 8452. Ha!

03:07:16.060 --> 03:07:20.060
I can't do no bad. I can't have a cat bad.

03:07:21.060 --> 03:07:23.060
I am cool.

03:07:33.060 --> 03:07:35.060
What? I'm a little hippie.

03:07:50.060 --> 03:07:52.060
I'm a little hippie.

03:08:20.060 --> 03:08:25.060
Can I go any further up or anything like that?

03:08:50.060 --> 03:09:16.060
Surgery and then a bunch of robot parts.

03:09:20.060 --> 03:09:35.060
You've been in the city below? I had a friend there.

03:09:35.060 --> 03:09:39.060
Fifi. I haven't seen him in ages. Did we see someone named Fifi?

03:09:45.060 --> 03:09:47.060
Down in the city below?

03:09:50.060 --> 03:09:54.060
I don't remember seeing anyone named Fifi.

03:10:21.060 --> 03:10:27.060
I don't remember. I don't remember. Me too.

03:10:31.060 --> 03:10:36.060
I don't know what the downstairs neighbors are up to.

03:10:36.060 --> 03:10:40.060
I keep hearing bazaar and hammer noises.

03:10:41.060 --> 03:10:43.060
Is the doctor?

03:10:50.060 --> 03:10:52.060
I don't know.

03:11:03.060 --> 03:11:06.060
I didn't say I could jump on their head.

03:11:06.060 --> 03:11:10.060
Oh no. I thought that was an option too.

03:11:10.060 --> 03:11:12.060
That'd be funny.

03:11:16.060 --> 03:11:18.060
Translate.

03:11:19.060 --> 03:11:22.060
Announcement.

03:11:23.060 --> 03:11:29.060
If you're looking for some company to talk about poetry, I live behind the elevator.

03:11:29.060 --> 03:11:31.060
Bonobot.

03:11:31.060 --> 03:11:36.060
I went and talked to them.

03:11:48.060 --> 03:12:12.060
I used to own a bar. It was the coziest place around here until I took a screwdriver in the knee and it's closed now.

03:12:18.060 --> 03:12:24.060
Even if this guy bums me out, he's my only customer. Try not to scare him away.

03:12:37.060 --> 03:12:39.060
Big city.

03:12:42.060 --> 03:12:46.060
Sorry shops closed. I'm waiting for the delivery guys.

03:12:46.060 --> 03:12:50.060
It seems they're taking their sweet time.

03:12:50.060 --> 03:12:58.060
What's this picture? Oh I know her. She was one of those people who all obsessed with the outside.

03:13:16.060 --> 03:13:18.060
I don't know.

03:13:18.060 --> 03:13:20.060
I don't know.

03:13:26.060 --> 03:13:28.060
I don't know.

03:13:28.060 --> 03:13:30.060
Oh.

03:13:43.060 --> 03:13:46.060
I'm feeling really epi.

03:13:46.060 --> 03:13:56.060
It's this triniest shop in the meantime where the shopkeeper is pretty grumpy.

03:13:56.060 --> 03:14:02.060
What a nice looking picture. Is that an address in the back?

03:14:02.060 --> 03:14:05.060
Yeah I know what the address is.

03:14:11.060 --> 03:14:14.060
I thought there was a door here.

03:14:16.060 --> 03:14:29.060
Are you one of those young punks listening to loud music all day? No.

03:14:29.060 --> 03:14:34.060
Don't touch anything. Don't make any noise. Don't ask for your credit.

03:14:34.060 --> 03:14:40.060
Whatever. I was going to ask you for anything anyways.

03:14:40.060 --> 03:14:42.060
Whatever.

03:14:42.060 --> 03:14:45.060
It's over here.

03:15:12.060 --> 03:15:22.060
I don't have anything to put in there.

03:15:29.060 --> 03:15:31.060
What was this?

03:15:35.060 --> 03:15:37.060
Where am I?

03:15:42.060 --> 03:15:46.060
It wouldn't let me the option to knock it down then pop up.

03:15:50.060 --> 03:15:52.060
It's another shop.

03:16:00.060 --> 03:16:02.060
What's this?

03:16:02.060 --> 03:16:04.060
Translate.

03:16:05.060 --> 03:16:10.060
Is it hell with the symptoms along with the outsiders?

03:16:16.060 --> 03:16:18.060
Chat.

03:16:18.060 --> 03:16:20.060
Chat.

03:16:24.060 --> 03:16:26.060
I'm tired.

03:16:30.060 --> 03:16:32.060
I'm really tired.

03:16:34.060 --> 03:16:36.060
I'm really tired.

03:16:43.060 --> 03:16:45.060
I'm so tired.

03:16:56.060 --> 03:16:59.060
I thought I could finish this.

03:17:00.060 --> 03:17:03.060
I could finish this in one sitting.

03:17:03.060 --> 03:17:05.060
But I did not get any sleep.

03:17:06.060 --> 03:17:08.060
But you could soon.

03:17:11.060 --> 03:17:14.060
I really need to go to sleep.

03:17:14.060 --> 03:17:16.060
I gotta go to bed.

03:17:18.060 --> 03:17:21.060
I have part three. Let's go.

03:17:21.060 --> 03:17:27.060
Don't ever believe in me again.

03:17:27.060 --> 03:17:29.060
I can do it.

03:17:30.060 --> 03:17:32.060
I can do it.

03:17:33.060 --> 03:17:36.060
Work hard again later.

03:17:43.060 --> 03:17:47.060
It's so hard. I cannot keep my eyes open.

03:17:47.060 --> 03:17:55.060
If I had gotten some really good sleep, baby, I could have gone on a little longer.

03:17:55.060 --> 03:17:57.060
But I haven't.

03:17:57.060 --> 03:18:01.060
I didn't sleep very good last night.

03:18:04.060 --> 03:18:06.060
The lady is getting a sleep.

03:18:06.060 --> 03:18:10.060
I have so much on my mind that was bothering me.

03:18:10.060 --> 03:18:13.060
How do you save the game?

03:18:13.060 --> 03:18:15.060
Is there a way to save?

03:18:17.060 --> 03:18:21.060
I don't know if it gets to a checkpoint or something.

03:18:23.060 --> 03:18:26.060
Where's the next checkpoint?

03:18:26.060 --> 03:18:29.060
I can save the game.

03:18:43.060 --> 03:18:45.060
I can save the game.

03:18:58.060 --> 03:19:00.060
I can save the game.

03:19:00.060 --> 03:19:13.060
Is there really nothing over there?

03:19:13.060 --> 03:19:15.060
Is it here?

03:19:15.060 --> 03:19:17.060
Or is it here?

03:19:30.060 --> 03:19:32.060
What's this?

03:19:32.060 --> 03:19:34.060
It's a jail.

03:20:01.060 --> 03:20:06.060
I can't believe that.

03:20:10.060 --> 03:20:15.060
If they threw them in jail, then their battery ran out.

03:20:15.060 --> 03:20:18.060
It's so horrible.

03:20:30.060 --> 03:20:35.060
Did the game save when I picked up the badge?

03:20:35.060 --> 03:20:37.060
I didn't look.

03:20:37.060 --> 03:20:40.060
I didn't check.

03:20:54.060 --> 03:20:57.060
How do you check?

03:20:58.060 --> 03:21:00.060
49 seconds.

03:21:00.060 --> 03:21:02.060
We're fine.

03:21:10.060 --> 03:21:14.060
We'll play the rest in the next one.

03:21:14.060 --> 03:21:16.060
I'm so tired.

03:21:16.060 --> 03:21:18.060
I'm so sorry, everyone.

03:21:18.060 --> 03:21:20.060
I'm so exhausted.

03:21:20.060 --> 03:21:23.060
I just really needed some sleep.

03:21:24.060 --> 03:21:27.060
It's time for bed.

03:21:34.060 --> 03:21:36.060
It's a fun game, though.

03:21:36.060 --> 03:21:38.060
I really like it a lot.

03:21:38.060 --> 03:21:41.060
It's super fun.

03:21:53.060 --> 03:21:55.060
It's a fun game.

03:21:55.060 --> 03:21:57.060
It's a fun game.

03:21:57.060 --> 03:21:59.060
It's a fun game.

03:21:59.060 --> 03:22:01.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:01.060 --> 03:22:03.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:03.060 --> 03:22:05.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:05.060 --> 03:22:07.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:07.060 --> 03:22:09.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:09.060 --> 03:22:11.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:11.060 --> 03:22:13.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:13.060 --> 03:22:15.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:15.060 --> 03:22:17.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:17.060 --> 03:22:19.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:19.060 --> 03:22:21.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:21.060 --> 03:22:23.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:23.060 --> 03:22:25.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:25.060 --> 03:22:27.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:27.060 --> 03:22:29.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:29.060 --> 03:22:31.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:31.060 --> 03:22:33.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:33.060 --> 03:22:35.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:35.060 --> 03:22:37.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:37.060 --> 03:22:39.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:39.060 --> 03:22:41.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:43.060 --> 03:22:45.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:45.060 --> 03:22:47.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:47.060 --> 03:22:49.060
It's a fun game

03:22:49.060 --> 03:22:51.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:51.060 --> 03:22:53.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:53.060 --> 03:22:55.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:55.060 --> 03:22:57.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:57.060 --> 03:22:59.060
It's a fun game.

03:22:59.060 --> 03:23:01.060
It's a fun game.

03:23:01.060 --> 03:23:03.060
It's a fun game.

03:23:03.060 --> 03:23:05.060
It's a fun game.

03:23:05.060 --> 03:23:07.060
It's a fun game.

03:23:07.060 --> 03:23:09.060
It's a fun game.

03:23:09.060 --> 03:23:11.060
It's a fun game.

03:23:11.060 --> 03:23:13.060
Can anyone read my poetry?

03:23:13.060 --> 03:23:15.060
Can anyone read my poetry?

03:23:15.060 --> 03:23:17.060
I can see you today.

03:23:17.060 --> 03:23:19.060
Well, well.

03:23:19.060 --> 03:23:21.060
Okay.

03:23:45.060 --> 03:23:47.060
Ychydig.

03:23:47.060 --> 03:23:49.060
Ychydig.

03:23:49.060 --> 03:23:51.060
Ychydig.

03:23:51.060 --> 03:23:53.060
Ychydig.

03:23:53.060 --> 03:23:55.060
Ychydig.

03:23:55.060 --> 03:23:57.060
Ychydig.

03:23:57.060 --> 03:23:59.060
Ychydig.

03:23:59.060 --> 03:24:01.060
Ychydig.

03:24:01.060 --> 03:24:03.060
Ychydig.

03:24:03.060 --> 03:24:05.060
Ychydig.

03:24:05.060 --> 03:24:07.060
Ychydig.

03:24:09.060 --> 03:24:11.060
Ychydig.

03:24:11.060 --> 03:24:13.060
Ychydig.

03:24:13.060 --> 03:24:15.060
Ychydig.

03:24:15.060 --> 03:24:17.060
Ychydig.

03:24:19.060 --> 03:24:21.060
Ychydig.

03:24:21.060 --> 03:24:23.060
Ychydig.

03:24:23.060 --> 03:24:25.060
Ychydig.

03:24:25.060 --> 03:24:27.060
Ychydig.

03:24:27.060 --> 03:24:29.060
Ychydig.

03:24:29.060 --> 03:24:31.060
Ychydig.

03:24:31.060 --> 03:24:33.060
Ychydig.

03:24:33.060 --> 03:24:35.060
Ychydig.

03:24:35.060 --> 03:24:37.060
Ychydig.

03:24:37.060 --> 03:24:39.060
Ychydig.

03:24:39.060 --> 03:24:41.060
Ychydig.

03:24:41.060 --> 03:24:50.180
I went through Helen back to fix my settings to make sure that my sound sounded okay and then

03:24:50.180 --> 03:25:03.220
my volume was okay. It could be hard, it wasn't too loud, it was too quiet. I finally fixed my audio

03:25:03.220 --> 03:25:15.780
and I think it's fine. Finally okay now. No strange noises, no buzzing, no nothing like that

03:25:15.780 --> 03:25:21.460
because none of that should be in it. None of that should be in it. Am I hearing background noises

03:25:21.460 --> 03:25:32.020
every now and then, but excuse me, that's okay. My god, it's good, it's been great honestly,

03:25:32.020 --> 03:25:48.900
it's good, yay. I'm happy, almost happy. Oh my goodness. And, and, and guess what, guess what, guess

03:25:48.900 --> 03:25:54.420
what? Oh my god, guess what? It's going on, never sorry, please don't forget to take your meds. Oh,

03:25:54.420 --> 03:25:59.860
I have completely forgot about that. Why? Yeah, I'll take my meds, I'll take on the meds right now,

03:25:59.860 --> 03:26:00.580
right now, right now.

03:26:00.740 --> 03:26:22.660
I don't think everything's on your stream, but it's good for the time I was here. I'm glad, I'm good.

03:26:23.540 --> 03:26:34.580
Yes, guess what? Also, also, also, I haven't crashed, I haven't crashed or my internet hasn't

03:26:34.580 --> 03:26:53.700
went out. This whole stream, is that amazing? I didn't crash, I didn't go out.

03:26:56.420 --> 03:27:00.740
Yay, we had a really good, really good stream.

03:27:04.580 --> 03:27:20.180
I love W. Yeah, we had an extreme score. I only think I wish me being very happy. Very happy.

03:27:23.780 --> 03:27:30.820
I promise I'll sleep. I'll be, I'll be up for a little bit and then I'm gonna just go sleep.

03:27:31.540 --> 03:27:39.540
I'm so tired. I was up all night because I was so sad. I was so sad last night.

03:27:43.060 --> 03:27:47.620
I must have, I should have been way more careful.

03:27:49.460 --> 03:27:56.820
And then I would have probably got monetized much earlier. But I was, I was being naughty.

03:27:56.820 --> 03:28:04.660
I guess you could say. I was being the stinker. I was the stinker.

03:28:17.300 --> 03:28:21.620
I was so sad and I was just constantly thinking about it last night.

03:28:22.580 --> 03:28:29.860
I ended up doing all my, I had an audio setting last night. I was just doing audio.

03:28:30.900 --> 03:28:35.060
As you know, audio found out why my volume was so messed up.

03:28:36.340 --> 03:28:40.020
Hawaii sounded so different. I finally figured it out.

03:28:40.740 --> 03:28:47.700
Set it up and it removed stuff. All my settings I had previously was okay.

03:28:47.700 --> 03:28:51.620
I couldn't figure out why everything else was messed up.

03:28:53.700 --> 03:28:56.420
Come to find out that it was just my window settings.

03:28:57.540 --> 03:29:05.780
My window volume went down for some reason and I fixed that up. That's all fixed up.

03:29:08.020 --> 03:29:13.460
And it was causing, like everything else was causing ducking and stuff. So

03:29:13.460 --> 03:29:20.980
if the other girls need help with their audio constantly ducking or peaking,

03:29:21.860 --> 03:29:25.220
I can help with it since I worked on it all night.

03:29:30.020 --> 03:29:31.620
It wasn't volume mixer.

03:29:31.620 --> 03:29:43.780
Cut out with the bleeding hires. Yeah, we could all cut out.

03:29:47.060 --> 03:29:50.340
No one expects you to marathon streams every day.

03:29:50.340 --> 03:29:54.420
I like streaming for a long time though. It keeps me very distracted.

03:29:54.500 --> 03:30:04.260
The world is a terrible place. Streaming is very fun. Very fun, very distracting.

03:30:06.580 --> 03:30:10.740
And I like being that distraction for other people as well,

03:30:11.300 --> 03:30:17.380
where you could just come in, relax, get cozy, focus on your voice, and then get some tears.

03:30:25.220 --> 03:30:40.420
I might do sleepy time stories for videos for you guys instead of live streams.

03:30:41.220 --> 03:30:46.020
Like just video videos of ASMR slayup.

03:30:46.980 --> 03:30:59.060
Aw, thank you. That's so sweet. Thank you so much for the $5 tip they had all for fun.

03:30:59.060 --> 03:31:09.620
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

03:31:16.020 --> 03:31:23.620
Mm-mm.

03:31:27.700 --> 03:31:29.620
Okay, are you with those two?

03:31:30.740 --> 03:31:37.700
Here, my best distraction. I'm glad. I'm glad I can be that space for you guys.

03:31:38.740 --> 03:31:43.060
I want to be that safe space. I might not be the extreme

03:31:43.780 --> 03:31:48.100
lwyd, like the other girls, because I know they can be a little

03:31:49.540 --> 03:31:59.540
intense. I can always be that nice, relaxing, comfy zone that you can retreat to.

03:32:00.260 --> 03:32:06.820
If the intensity is too much for you, you can always come to me and mama will take care of you.

03:32:06.820 --> 03:32:12.980
Mm-hmm. That's taking. No, I won't take it right now.

03:32:36.820 --> 03:32:42.980
Wow.

03:32:48.020 --> 03:33:04.980
That's good. I really need to pick up my pain meds, though. My shoulder has been killing me.

03:33:06.820 --> 03:33:13.780
Oh, thank you.

03:33:18.020 --> 03:33:22.980
You're just so sweet. Oh, my gosh. You're so sweet. Thank you, Peony,

03:33:23.540 --> 03:33:30.980
because I still don't know how to pronounce your name correctly. Peony. Peony.

03:33:30.980 --> 03:33:40.900
Thank you for the $4 tip, Peony. I'm so glad you enjoy my strength.

03:33:41.780 --> 03:33:45.940
And yes, Black Wolf. Black Wolf, thank you so much for the $4 tip.

03:33:46.820 --> 03:33:50.900
Every time because I was with Mommy. I'm glad you enjoy it.

03:33:50.900 --> 03:34:01.860
I'm so sorry, Peony.

03:34:13.940 --> 03:34:18.180
I have taken my meds if anyone is asking. I'm wondering they have been taken.

03:34:18.180 --> 03:34:29.140
And when you get your soft voice going, my back just shimmers. That's it.

03:34:29.140 --> 03:34:45.140
Oh, am I glasses? Yeah. I need to pick those up, too.

03:34:45.140 --> 03:35:01.140
That's true. I'll call them tomorrow. I promise. Just remind me. I'll do it. I'll call them tomorrow.

03:35:01.140 --> 03:35:11.140
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow.

03:35:23.700 --> 03:35:28.100
I love being here so much just because it's so calm and relaxing. Letters can be too much

03:35:28.100 --> 03:35:36.020
at times. That's why I like it here. I'm glad I've been kind of beating myself up to be like the other girls.

03:35:37.300 --> 03:35:44.100
Like, I don't know. I just don't have it in me to be that way when I'm live, you know?

03:35:44.740 --> 03:35:52.100
I'm a little embarrassed and I get really red with face burns.

03:35:52.100 --> 03:36:06.100
But being like this is very easy for me. It's natural. It's just who I am. I just be myself when I stream live.

03:36:06.100 --> 03:36:16.100
It'd be me and then I like it comfy and being as sweet to you guys. But you're so sweet to me.

03:36:16.660 --> 03:36:25.300
Well, I don't know. As to purposely trying to be loose with them as it's my thing.

03:36:27.620 --> 03:36:35.540
Especially while live. But doing like recordings and stuff is easy. I can record. I can do that.

03:36:37.380 --> 03:36:42.100
I don't have too many eyes on me watching me.

03:36:46.100 --> 03:36:48.100
What?

03:37:02.340 --> 03:37:10.100
You're doing great. Nothing of yourself about it. So that makes you feel comfy. You know, I enjoy the comfy.

03:37:10.100 --> 03:37:20.100
Yeah, it's just I've already gotten a few morals wishing that I was more fluid by so many morals.

03:37:20.100 --> 03:37:27.700
I haven't really sorry. I haven't I've been reading everyone's morals. So many people sent me some really nice things, but

03:37:28.500 --> 03:37:38.100
I haven't been able to respond to a majority of morals lately because I think I've flooded with quite a few of things that got me a little

03:37:38.100 --> 03:37:43.860
sad. So I've been avoiding the morals for the time being.

03:37:48.100 --> 03:37:55.300
But it's perfectly fine. They're not bad. They're not extremely bad. It's just me being the little overthinker that I am.

03:37:56.020 --> 03:37:58.660
That's all. Nothing extremely bad.

03:37:58.660 --> 03:38:08.820
Just a lot of morals. Every time I go through like 50 morals, there's like 100 more.

03:38:09.620 --> 03:38:15.780
I go through like 25 morals and there's another 100 more. I can't. It's so many.

03:38:16.260 --> 03:38:23.220
And then I have to skip some and I feel bad skipping morals. It's so many morals.

03:38:23.220 --> 03:38:27.780
It's so many.

03:38:27.780 --> 03:38:46.740
I

03:38:47.140 --> 03:38:54.700
Mi'n ddana yn bwysig mae hwnna o'r tîngr o gyfo.

Snw'n hefyd yn ystod drosh o

03:39:14.380 --> 03:39:17.660
I'm glad. I like the way you guys react whenever I hit you with something.

03:39:22.940 --> 03:39:29.100
The way you guys fall. Have hiccups. The way you guys fall and crumple.

03:39:33.020 --> 03:39:35.660
Ravel in my feet.

03:39:35.660 --> 03:39:37.660
I'm glad.

03:39:41.340 --> 03:39:43.340
Yeah.

03:39:44.620 --> 03:39:47.900
As long as I'm after a carrot, I am pretty much.

03:39:51.340 --> 03:39:53.340
You love gremlin also.

03:40:06.460 --> 03:40:08.460
Mmm. That's fine.

03:40:11.020 --> 03:40:17.420
There's like many great emails at work. There's so many of them. Yeah. They're hard.

03:40:19.820 --> 03:40:25.260
You guys, there's one. There's a small amount. I will try. I'll do my absolute best.

03:40:26.860 --> 03:40:33.100
I just feel so bad because I answered so many morals, but I never used marshmallow before.

03:40:33.900 --> 03:40:37.580
So I didn't know how to make them public, nor like or

03:40:38.300 --> 03:40:43.900
send morals before, but now I know and I can try.

03:40:44.940 --> 03:40:46.940
I'll try again.

03:40:49.500 --> 03:40:51.500
I'll try again.

03:40:51.500 --> 03:41:04.460
Mmm. I'll read them out to my own pairs.

03:41:06.700 --> 03:41:11.820
Your voice is loud enough for me. It's just my normal voice.

03:41:15.420 --> 03:41:17.420
What a man.

03:41:19.100 --> 03:41:21.100
Melt from her words.

03:41:22.300 --> 03:41:27.340
Melt. Melt away. Melt for me.

03:41:31.580 --> 03:41:35.500
Mwami. Mwai a crumbel anasura saeth anethang.

03:41:40.540 --> 03:41:42.540
Come on, melt away.

03:41:43.340 --> 03:41:47.100
You might need a higher person. Just sort your morals.

03:41:48.540 --> 03:41:50.300
Possibly.

03:41:50.300 --> 03:41:56.540
But I like going through them. I just feel, I just have this urge not to miss out on anything.

03:41:57.500 --> 03:42:02.220
And I don't know. Maybe I'll have to think on it.

03:42:05.020 --> 03:42:10.380
But I'm sure that we are kind of already like, I can like

03:42:12.620 --> 03:42:14.620
get that figured out regardless.

03:42:16.060 --> 03:42:18.060
So it'll be fine.

03:42:18.860 --> 03:42:23.900
I'm sure I can take up any kind of offers

03:42:25.180 --> 03:42:27.180
that they can help me out with.

03:42:27.740 --> 03:42:32.060
Manzan and Shrani has done an amazing job thus far with helping me out.

03:42:32.700 --> 03:42:36.540
I'm a very clumsy person and I think I have like the worst luck in the world.

03:42:37.260 --> 03:42:40.220
The worst absolutely fucked world luck in the world.

03:42:40.700 --> 03:42:43.500
And it's been like that for years ever since I was young.

03:42:44.380 --> 03:42:46.220
I've gotten hurt.

03:42:46.220 --> 03:42:48.700
Restrained as accidents have been around me.

03:42:49.980 --> 03:42:52.620
I cause big things to happen on accident.

03:42:54.540 --> 03:42:59.580
This has been like a thing that has been running on with me for like a long, long, long time.

03:43:00.540 --> 03:43:02.540
So yeah.

03:43:04.300 --> 03:43:07.340
All I can do is power through it because I'm used to it.

03:43:07.820 --> 03:43:13.180
But I feel so bad when other people get involved and then messes with them.

03:43:14.060 --> 03:43:15.180
As well.

03:43:15.180 --> 03:43:17.340
If it's just me, it's fine.

03:43:17.340 --> 03:43:19.980
Yeah, I'll be sad about it, but it is what it is.

03:43:29.500 --> 03:43:31.500
I know I defy as a puddle.

03:43:32.300 --> 03:43:33.580
I'll be doing okay.

03:43:33.580 --> 03:43:36.300
Don't do things that make you uncomfortable.

03:43:36.300 --> 03:43:39.820
Be comfy and we'll be comfy.

03:43:39.820 --> 03:43:40.540
I'm comfy.

03:43:41.100 --> 03:43:41.820
I'm very comfy.

03:43:41.820 --> 03:43:44.460
Today was a really nice comfy stream today.

03:43:44.460 --> 03:43:46.380
So I really enjoyed the day.

03:43:46.380 --> 03:43:47.260
A lot of fun.

03:43:48.140 --> 03:43:53.580
I'm just very sleepy and I'll be sleeping very soon.

03:43:53.580 --> 03:43:57.340
Once this medication starts kicking in, I'm definitely going to go head to head.

03:44:04.700 --> 03:44:07.900
We want to be good boys and girls for you, Mumu.

03:44:07.900 --> 03:44:09.420
You are good boys.

03:44:09.980 --> 03:44:11.740
And you are good girls.

03:44:12.380 --> 03:44:16.540
I'm very proud of you for being here and supporting your Mumu.

03:44:19.020 --> 03:44:21.180
You're all very brave and very good.

03:44:23.820 --> 03:44:25.660
Take it at your own pace, Mumu.

03:44:25.660 --> 03:44:26.220
I will.

03:44:27.340 --> 03:44:29.340
Are you today or more yet?

03:44:29.340 --> 03:44:30.060
Just a bit.

03:44:31.660 --> 03:44:33.020
Well, I'm lucky to find you.

03:44:34.540 --> 03:44:35.260
That's so sweet.

03:44:35.260 --> 03:44:35.740
Thank you.

03:44:40.220 --> 03:44:43.340
I'll be here to support you 100% of the way.

03:44:43.900 --> 03:44:44.460
Thank you.

03:44:55.980 --> 03:44:58.940
I can only wish and hope that is the case.

03:45:00.140 --> 03:45:01.580
I can only hope.

03:45:03.260 --> 03:45:06.460
I'd rather be kind than mean to gain good luck.

03:45:07.260 --> 03:45:13.020
If it just means that it's just me getting at fault, then that's fine.

03:45:13.660 --> 03:45:16.460
But I just don't like when other people get affected.

03:45:17.900 --> 03:45:21.500
Thank you so much for the $4 tip the iron reaper.

03:45:21.500 --> 03:45:22.300
Thank you so much.

03:45:22.300 --> 03:45:22.620
Thank you.

03:45:22.620 --> 03:45:23.100
Thank you.

03:45:32.700 --> 03:45:33.820
I love your goddess.

03:45:33.820 --> 03:45:34.380
That's why.

03:45:34.380 --> 03:45:35.020
Thank you.

03:45:35.020 --> 03:45:36.060
Maximum comfort.

03:45:37.820 --> 03:45:40.380
Will you can get a great sleep tonight?

03:45:40.380 --> 03:45:41.660
I'm very sure I will.

03:45:42.940 --> 03:45:45.900
I am going to just sleep tonight.

03:45:46.620 --> 03:45:48.140
You guys got me this fan.

03:45:48.140 --> 03:45:49.420
I have a toaster.

03:45:49.420 --> 03:45:50.620
I've been eating toast.

03:45:50.620 --> 03:45:52.140
I've been actually eating some food.

03:45:53.820 --> 03:45:55.580
Though I caved and got pizza,

03:45:56.220 --> 03:46:00.140
but I have so much more pizza left over and this can last me for a few days.

03:46:01.020 --> 03:46:02.860
I'll make sure to stretch it out.

03:46:02.940 --> 03:46:06.380
Even though I ate like four slices and three cheese sticks.

03:46:10.300 --> 03:46:10.940
That's fine.

03:46:12.300 --> 03:46:15.340
I guess stretch the rest out for the rest of the days.

03:46:22.380 --> 03:46:25.100
Can we get a good night kiss before you go?

03:46:25.100 --> 03:46:25.660
Yeah, sure.

03:46:25.660 --> 03:46:26.620
I can do that for you.

03:46:28.940 --> 03:46:30.380
But it will have to be a quick one.

03:46:33.660 --> 03:46:34.460
There you go.

03:46:36.620 --> 03:46:42.140
I'm really looking forward to what you have planned for ASMR videos and stuff like that.

03:46:42.140 --> 03:46:47.500
Most of it's just going to be some of the stuff I already talked about.

03:46:48.780 --> 03:46:53.260
And I was really, really looking forward to doing the workout ASMRs, but

03:46:54.860 --> 03:46:56.460
I hope you enjoyed it.

03:46:56.460 --> 03:46:58.460
I'll see you in the next video.

03:47:02.860 --> 03:47:06.620
With YouTube being the way it's being right now, I don't think that's a really wise idea.

03:47:07.420 --> 03:47:12.220
So we'll have to put that on hold for a while until it seems safe to do so.

03:47:13.660 --> 03:47:16.540
For now, I'll stick to doing regular ASMRs.

03:47:17.420 --> 03:47:21.740
I'm trying to find some triggers for you guys that I can do,

03:47:21.740 --> 03:47:28.620
but I'll probably mostly praising and taking in requests of things you want me to say.

03:47:28.700 --> 03:47:29.820
Because I'll do that then.

03:47:31.660 --> 03:47:32.300
Request.

03:47:33.500 --> 03:47:37.260
And some petting and brushing.

03:47:38.300 --> 03:47:44.060
And I have bubble wrap, plastic licking and tapping.

03:47:44.060 --> 03:47:47.420
I don't really have much to tap with,

03:47:49.740 --> 03:47:52.060
but I can do tapping and stuff like that.

03:47:53.180 --> 03:47:54.220
Oh, and heartbeats.

03:47:54.220 --> 03:47:58.460
Thank you to heartbeats for you guys.

03:48:02.940 --> 03:48:06.780
If you're ever feeling bad just remember we are always here for you in our world.

03:48:06.780 --> 03:48:07.500
Thank you.

03:48:07.500 --> 03:48:10.220
I'm so happy to have all of you here.

03:48:10.940 --> 03:48:13.660
My sweet little bleeding hearts.

03:48:14.620 --> 03:48:15.980
My sweet sweet babies.

03:48:15.980 --> 03:48:23.020
Thank you all so much for all of your support and my endeavours.

03:48:25.020 --> 03:48:27.020
Mmm.

03:48:30.700 --> 03:48:33.900
Hopefully you'll get the monetization soon.

03:48:33.900 --> 03:48:37.740
Hopefully, but it'll probably take quite some time.

03:48:38.460 --> 03:48:42.620
So I hope you're all able to wait for me.

03:48:43.820 --> 03:48:45.100
Wait for me please.

03:48:46.940 --> 03:48:51.740
Really sorry that I wasn't more prepared.

03:48:54.620 --> 03:48:56.140
For the monetization.

03:48:56.140 --> 03:48:56.940
I'm really sorry.

03:49:02.460 --> 03:49:04.380
I want you to say you're good.

03:49:05.740 --> 03:49:09.420
I'll feel as long as you request it.

03:49:10.140 --> 03:49:11.020
I can do that.

03:49:20.460 --> 03:49:22.380
Heartbeats are one of my favourites.

03:49:22.380 --> 03:49:23.260
They help me calm.

03:49:23.820 --> 03:49:24.620
I'm glad.

03:49:26.620 --> 03:49:27.420
I'll wait.

03:49:27.420 --> 03:49:29.420
I'll wait for you as long as it takes.

03:49:30.140 --> 03:49:30.780
Wait.

03:49:30.780 --> 03:49:31.660
I'm glad.

03:49:31.660 --> 03:49:32.220
Thank you.

03:49:32.860 --> 03:49:33.500
I love you.

03:49:36.300 --> 03:49:37.180
In the meantime.

03:49:45.820 --> 03:49:46.860
In the meantime.

03:49:46.860 --> 03:49:57.580
Let us see who we can read for tonight.

03:49:59.260 --> 03:50:00.380
I believe we can read

03:50:05.340 --> 03:50:07.340
Mercerys, Mercy Live.

03:50:08.380 --> 03:50:09.660
Oh, just not.

03:50:11.100 --> 03:50:11.660
Is she not?

03:50:12.300 --> 03:50:13.580
I have to refresh the page.

03:50:14.700 --> 03:50:16.140
So let me, you know.

03:50:17.820 --> 03:50:20.940
Well, nobody's live.

03:50:21.980 --> 03:50:23.020
Nobody's live.

03:50:29.420 --> 03:50:31.020
We can read into Aimee.

03:50:34.060 --> 03:50:37.420
Aimee from Yumi Plus.

03:50:39.500 --> 03:50:41.420
From Yumi Plus we'll read into Aimee.

03:50:42.060 --> 03:50:45.420
This is my first read that isn't within

03:50:46.860 --> 03:50:47.420
aimee.

03:50:48.860 --> 03:50:53.260
It's not within aimee alor.

03:50:55.180 --> 03:50:57.340
I almost forgot my own company's name.

03:50:59.100 --> 03:51:00.780
Well, I'm really unsleepy.

03:51:12.460 --> 03:51:14.300
That means you have to stay right?

03:51:14.300 --> 03:51:14.540
No.

03:51:14.540 --> 03:51:15.100
No.

03:51:16.780 --> 03:51:19.660
On those day I have to go get a cleave.

03:51:19.660 --> 03:51:25.020
I'll be streaming tomorrow some supermarket simulator.

03:51:25.580 --> 03:51:26.700
And we'll have some more.

03:51:27.340 --> 03:51:29.340
I'm going to bit my lip just now.

03:51:31.340 --> 03:51:34.140
We'll have some more cozy time together.

03:51:40.940 --> 03:51:41.900
I really bit my lip.

03:51:44.540 --> 03:51:54.140
So, let's read into them.

03:51:54.140 --> 03:51:57.260
And via Zora, via Zora, via Zora.

03:51:57.260 --> 03:51:58.940
If you made it this far into the video,

03:51:58.940 --> 03:52:00.940
please leave a comment down below.

03:52:00.940 --> 03:52:05.980
And tell me, what is your favorite Pokemon?

03:52:08.140 --> 03:52:09.900
What is your favorite Pokemon?

03:52:09.900 --> 03:52:13.900
Since you asked me, what's yours?

03:52:13.900 --> 03:52:16.140
In the comments down below if you made it this far.

03:52:17.580 --> 03:52:19.580

03:52:26.540 --> 03:52:28.460
Please subscribe, please.

03:52:30.460 --> 03:52:32.620
I need a please.

03:52:32.620 --> 03:52:38.220
I had, don't forget to buy a merch.

03:52:38.220 --> 03:52:44.700
And visit my Patreon with the link down below.

03:52:44.700 --> 03:52:48.620
I'm really sorry if any of my audio has been really boopy

03:52:49.740 --> 03:52:54.300
in any of the videos and stuff.

03:52:55.580 --> 03:52:57.180
I was really bad with audio.

03:52:57.180 --> 03:52:59.740
And over time, I'll definitely get better.

03:52:59.740 --> 03:53:00.860
So please understand.

03:53:00.860 --> 03:53:05.260
I'm really sorry if anything hasn't been up to your expectations.

03:53:06.220 --> 03:53:07.100
I'm really sorry.

03:53:10.620 --> 03:53:13.180
So, have a really good night everyone.

03:53:13.180 --> 03:53:14.700
I hope I'm not forgetting anything.

03:53:16.380 --> 03:53:18.380
And I'll see you guys tomorrow, okay?

03:53:21.740 --> 03:53:24.940
Good night, my sweet loves, my sweet pleading hearts.

03:53:26.540 --> 03:53:27.420
Good night, good night.

03:53:31.820 --> 03:53:33.420
Night.

03:53:35.500 --> 03:53:36.220
Bye.

03:53:37.740 --> 03:53:40.380
I wanna miss you till tomorrow.

03:53:40.380 --> 03:53:41.820
I'll think about you.

03:53:41.820 --> 03:53:43.100
I dream about you.

03:53:43.900 --> 03:53:44.860
Dream about me.

03:53:45.580 --> 03:53:46.060
Please.

03:53:47.420 --> 03:53:48.140
Love you.

03:53:49.020 --> 03:53:50.140
Mommy loves you.
