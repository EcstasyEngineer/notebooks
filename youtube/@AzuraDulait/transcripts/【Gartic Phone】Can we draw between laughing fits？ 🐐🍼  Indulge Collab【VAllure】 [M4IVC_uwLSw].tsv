1278960	1279960	Are you in the lobby?
1279960	1281960	Do you need to reload the lobby?
1281960	1283960	It's going to do it on its own usually.
1283960	1285960	No, I'm gone.
1286880	1288880	The link should be in the discord.
1288880	1291880	Don't show your fucking screen on the discord.
1291880	1293880	Yeah.
1293880	1294880	Don't do that.
1294880	1295880	Don't do that.
1295880	1298880	I don't see all of our naughty photos we just send to each other.
1298880	1300880	I want to do that.
1300880	1302880	It's mostly memes.
1302880	1304880	Any memes.
1304880	1306880	I mean, to be fair, we did share.
1306880	1308880	We did share some actually.
1308880	1312880	We did share some lucky nudes of ours.
1312880	1314880	They've seen my titties.
1315800	1318800	I saw Brooklyn as the girls with my nudes.
1318800	1320800	So I was like, this is what Amy would do.
1320800	1322800	This is what A.C. would do.
1322800	1324800	Your discord is so chaotic.
1324800	1326800	Okay, real though.
1328800	1331800	But also, I did snort out my tea.
1331800	1334800	It went down the wrong hole and went up my nose.
1334800	1338800	Wow, Marcy, I hear you snort in tea.
1338800	1341800	This is what got me off at the stock throne.
1341800	1343800	Is this better?
1343800	1345800	It hurts so much.
1345800	1347800	Can you hear me now?
1347800	1349800	Oh, yeah.
1349800	1351800	Oh my god.

1353800	1355800	I'm so sorry.
1355800	1357800	My clit is getting a little heart beat right now every time you talk.
1357800	1359800	Oh no.
1361800	1365800	I was muted and my thingy was turned down.
1365800	1367800	That's my bad.
1367800	1369800	Oopsie.
1369800	1371800	Oopsie.
1371800	1375800	I feel like Azura could do a really good Jennifer Coolidge impression.

1405800	1407800	Speaking of your gap for the Rizzler.

1409800	1413800	Why are we opening our gap for the Rizzler?

1433800	1435800	All I hear is screaming.
1435800	1437800	Your mic cuts out.
1437800	1439800	So it just goes eww.
1439800	1441800	Eww.
1441800	1443800	Eww.
1443800	1445800	I don't even know what's happening.
1445800	1447800	It's constantly loading.
1447800	1449800	It says, did you know
1449800	1451800	Group DLs
1451800	1453800	can have up to 10 members?
1453800	1455800	I'm sorry.
1455800	1457800	Now I see the discord.
1457800	1459800	If I open it up, you guys can't see it.
1459800	1461800	My discord is just broken.
1461800	1463800	I don't see anything else.
1463800	1465800	I would close the window capture
1465800	1467800	in the OBS just in case.
1467800	1469800	Yes, you can turn it off.
1469800	1471800	Are we starting a new lobby?
1471800	1473800	A new lobby?
1473800	1475800	Hang on.
1475800	1477800	Let me invite to this lobby.
1477800	1479800	That's power.
1479800	1481800	Are we going to a different room?
1481800	1483800	I don't know.
1483800	1485800	What is that?
1485800	1487800	I only see one of you.
1487800	1489800	On mine, sorry.
1489800	1491800	A new one?
1491800	1493800	There's another one.
1493800	1495800	Are you okay?
1495800	1497800	Okay, which one should we play?
1497800	1499800	Which one?
1499800	1501800	Normal, which we just did.
1501800	1503800	Knock off, keep yourself focused.
1503800	1505800	Try to replicate the drawings while the clock gets faster.
1505800	1507800	Animation.
1507800	1509800	Create animations in a collaborative way.
1509800	1511800	Icebreaker, play with a sentence.
1511800	1513800	Drawings, exquisite corpse.
1513800	1515800	Create surrealist characters connected by the top of the drawings.
1515800	1517800	Don't know what that means.
1517800	1519800	Hold on.
1519800	1521800	Burp friends, have a good time with that.
1521800	1523800	Compliment, complete the sketch.
1523800	1525800	Start with basic lines and see other players' interpretations.
1525800	1527800	Masterpiece,
1527800	1529800	create a piece of art, play in a single turn with no time limit.
1529800	1531800	I feel like story would be funny.
1531800	1533800	Write a narrative using only the previous sentence as a reference.
1533800	1535800	Yes, okay, okay.
1535800	1537800	Story, story, story.
1537800	1539800	Do you want to do a story?
1539800	1541800	Let's try story.
1541800	1543800	What are we doing?
1543800	1545800	What is this?
1545800	1547800	Start writing a story.
1551800	1553800	Wait, do I have to write a full story or just a sentence?
1553800	1555800	Just a sentence.
1555800	1557800	Just one sentence.
1557800	1559800	Okay, okay.
1561800	1563800	Do you like write the whole story or no?
1563800	1565800	No, you have really limited characters.
1569800	1571800	I don't know it.
1571800	1573800	No!
1573800	1575800	What did you do?
1575800	1577800	There's time, there's time.
1579800	1581800	15 seconds, love.
1581800	1583800	Oh my god, I wanted to write more.
1583800	1585800	I wanted to write more.
1585800	1587800	You can only write one sentence.
1587800	1589800	Fuck.
1589800	1591800	Shit.
1591800	1593800	The end.
1595800	1597800	We are not being attack allegations.
1597800	1599800	We are not.
1599800	1601800	What the fuck is happening?
1609800	1611800	Oh, they're going to know this is me spelling it
1611800	1613800	because I didn't use a Z on that.
1617800	1619800	I'm just going to leave it like that.
1619800	1621800	Yep, I'm sending it.
1621800	1623800	I'm not even spell checking.
1623800	1625800	Fuck it.
1625800	1627800	Fuck it.
1627800	1629800	Fuck it.
1629800	1631800	I'm bad at stories.
1631800	1633800	What?
1641800	1643800	So big.
1649800	1651800	Oh, the sentence is so small.
1651800	1653800	I want to give up everything.
1653800	1655800	Me too.
1655800	1657800	Let's do short.
1657800	1659800	I think I get shorter over time.
1661800	1663800	I want to be like, bi-bing.
1669800	1671800	I'm going to write until, fuck.
1671800	1673800	What?
1675800	1677800	Um, okay.
1679800	1681800	Let's see.
1681800	1683800	Let's see.
1685800	1687800	Oh, no.
1687800	1689800	Fuck.
1689800	1691800	Fuck, I'm so bad.
1693800	1695800	Fuck.
1695800	1697800	It's funny because
1697800	1699800	I hate this. I can't think of anything.
1699800	1701800	The wavelengths, the snowberries, the snippets,
1701800	1703800	the pin pals,
1703800	1705800	the bleeding hearts and the harem
1705800	1707800	all get to see this unfold
1707800	1709800	and we're all just taping like
1709800	1711800	Oh, fuck it.
1711800	1713800	I don't fucking know.
1713800	1715800	Oh, you.
1715800	1717800	Wait, is that the fucking
1719800	1721800	and
1721800	1723800	happy kitty
1723800	1725800	sleepy kitty
1725800	1727800	purr purr purr.
1727800	1729800	You watch fucking
1729800	1731800	big bang theory.
1731800	1733800	Wait, that's my spell.
1733800	1735800	Paris.
1735800	1737800	Fuck.
1737800	1739800	Give me more.
1745800	1747800	I need more letters.
1747800	1749800	I need more like
1749800	1751800	amazing
1751800	1753800	amazing
1753800	1755800	writer.
1755800	1757800	They jerk so hard.
1757800	1759800	Motherfuckers want to find me.
1759800	1761800	That sounds like sheavey.
1761800	1763800	No.
1765800	1767800	They jerk so hard.
1767800	1769800	Motherfuckers want to find me.
1769800	1771800	I don't know this lyric though.
1771800	1773800	This agency
1773800	1775800	is crazy.
1775800	1777800	We can't just
1777800	1779800	I spelled it wrong but that's the point.
1779800	1781800	I hate that's like
1781800	1783800	they don't give you enough to write.
1783800	1785800	It's like
1785800	1787800	this is not enough.
1787800	1789800	Fuck off.
1791800	1793800	Oh boy. Okay, let's see what's happening.
1793800	1795800	What the fuck is going to be?
1795800	1797800	Let's do the auto.
1797800	1799800	This is terrible.
1799800	1801800	How about everybody reads their own story?
1801800	1803800	Yeah, of course.
1803800	1805800	Okay, I go first.
1805800	1807800	In a galaxy far far away
1807800	1809800	there was a goat with big titties.
1809800	1811800	She had so much milkers
1811800	1813800	and started raining milk.
1813800	1815800	Azera then went home
1815800	1817800	to make an empire made milk daily.
1817800	1819800	It was so successful
1819800	1821800	the neighboring kingdoms became jealous.
1821800	1823800	They also wanted some of the juicy.
1827800	1829800	Ew cooties are not good.
1829800	1831800	Good.
1831800	1833800	You're not good.
1833800	1835800	You're not good.
1835800	1837800	Oh boy.
1837800	1839800	Why do we both start to sing?
1841800	1843800	There was a boy by a princess
1843800	1845800	who was trying to fit in too.
1846780	1848780	Oh
1848780	1850780	My hand yeah
1867780	1869780	I didn't know what this is but
1869780	1871780	I was like this thing didn't change.
1871780	1873780	Oh gosh.
1873780	1875780	Oh my god.
1875780	1877380	I was so hard.
1877380	1879380	Ronnie, who was in Paris?
1879380	1881380	I was in Paris!
1881380	1883380	I was in Paris!
1883380	1885380	I was in Paris!
1885380	1889380	It was just a beach of agency that was lit.
1889380	1895380	They all couldn't control the urges that they had.
1895380	1899380	So they danced, the pee-pee danced until they...
1899380	1906980	Then finally, they peed everywhere on the floor, the walls, the bed, the kind.
1906980	1908980	We're all filled up.
1908980	1910980	There's everywhere, but he loved it.
1910980	1916980	The fact that we got the best prompt before AC came out with that.
1916980	1918980	He's either going to be AC or not.
1918980	1920980	AC got a box of booze!
1920980	1922980	AC in the morn.
1922980	1924980	Heard.
1924980	1926980	Sevens character added.
1926980	1928980	This is so good.
1929580	1930580	Okay.
1930580	1932580	Once upon a time, there were whores.
1932580	1934580	They were the eliters of whores.
1934580	1936580	Bitches in the wild west.
1936580	1938580	They all were really cute cowgirls.
1938580	1940580	Boozy cats.
1940580	1942580	So cute.
1942580	1944580	So fuzzy.
1944580	1946580	So pussy-warm.
1946580	1948580	Big bang theory.
1948580	1950580	More like bang-bang your mom last night.
1950580	1952580	You keep my mom out of your home now.
1954580	1956580	Sorry.
1956580	1958580	10 out of 10.
1959180	1961180	At the time, they were like big thoms.
1961180	1963180	Oh, no.
1963180	1965180	Oh, no.
1969180	1971180	Oh, no.
1971180	1973180	What's going on?
1973180	1975180	Big thoms!
1979180	1981180	What's going on?
1981180	1983180	What's going on?
1983780	1985780	No, no, no.
1986780	1988780	It took a lot!
1988780	1990780	What's going on?
1990780	1992780	My face hurts a lot.
1992780	1994780	This is so bad.
1998780	2000780	Once upon a time,
2000780	2002780	she even had to take a nap.
2002780	2004780	A community zero wrote about each other.
2004780	2006780	She was sad because she realized
2006780	2008780	she didn't have a prostate.
2008780	2010780	I said shit.
2010780	2012780	No way!
2012780	2015740	Why do I keep talking about shit all the time?
2018740	2022140	Alright, this is so bad. I hate this.
2023540	2025540	Fuck no!
2027540	2030540	No, I didn't want to be pregnant by Sonic!
2030540	2033700	Ezra, do you have a make filter on? I can never hear you.
2033700	2034500	I don't.
2034500	2035500	Piss me, you don't!
2035500	2036620	Turn that mic.
2036620	2037100	Get us!
2037100	2040700	I don't have a filter on!
2040700	2041700	No, it's fine!
2041700	2044700	You don't have a filter on!
2044700	2046020	There's no filter on?
2046020	2048020	No, there's no filter on.
2048020	2050020	You're still series filter.
2050020	2054020	I don't have a filter. I don't have one on.
2054020	2056020	Definitely, so you guys can hear it on all my phones.
2056020	2058020	What is happening?
2058020	2060020	Hang on.
2060020	2062020	Can't wait for the board if they survive.
2062020	2064020	Yeah, these ones, I don't know.
2064020	2066020	They'll be fine, don't worry about it.
2066020	2068020	You guys don't play this one or do you want to try another one?
2068020	2070020	It's peaking.
2070020	2072020	That was an incomplete drawing.
2072020	2074020	Please, please, no more shits.
2074020	2076020	No more shits!
2076020	2078020	No more shits!
2078020	2080020	No promises!
2080020	2082020	No promises, I can't promise.
2082020	2084020	Did you guys miss stuff?
2084020	2086020	Did you miss the compliment?
2086020	2088020	Yeah, I promised that.
2088020	2090020	Compliment.
2090020	2092020	All the actions are a mystery.
2092020	2094020	Drawings and sentences are hidden during this.
2094020	2096020	You can't hear Mercy?
2096020	2098020	Sorry, sorry.
2098020	2100020	Because I was coughing because I was laughing
2100020	2102020	my side hurts so badly.
2102020	2104020	No.
2104020	2106020	Okay, Mercy test complete.
2106020	2108020	Do you want to do compliment?
2110020	2112020	What is that?
2112020	2114020	We draw on each other's drawings, basically.
2114020	2116020	Oh, we should try that.
2116020	2118020	I think that would be fun.
2118020	2120020	Yeah.
2120020	2122020	We could draw so much piss.
2122020	2124020	Oh god.
2124020	2126020	Let's start sketching some basic lines.
2126020	2128020	Okay.
2128020	2130020	Let me do this.
2132020	2134020	Maybe I could just...
2134020	2136020	Maybe I'll do some basic lines.
2136020	2138020	Like, ooh.
2138020	2140020	Okay, boom.
2142020	2144020	Ooh.
2144020	2146020	Wait, now I'm just going to draw a bunch of dicks.
2146020	2148020	The castle.
2148020	2150020	I can't believe it.
2150020	2152020	The castle.
2152020	2154020	No!
2154020	2156020	Cute.
2156020	2158020	Blockers.
2158020	2160020	Oh god.
2160020	2162020	You know exactly what you did.
2162020	2164020	And no, I don't have the strength to resist.
2164020	2166020	What?
2166020	2168020	Wait, I got it. I got it.
2168020	2170020	I can make this. I can salvage this.
2170020	2172020	This is the back legs of it.
2172020	2174020	And then this is its huge
2174020	2176020	milkers.
2180020	2182020	Like...
2182020	2184020	Oh.
2184020	2186020	Oh.
2186020	2188020	Oh.
2188020	2190020	A big
2190020	2192020	fish up bruh.
2192020	2194020	Oh my god, I've just made shimmy up.
2194020	2196020	What the hell?
2196020	2198020	What is my name?
2198020	2200020	Oh wait, that's a thing.
2200020	2202020	Oh no, that looks like...
2202020	2204020	Dang it.
2204020	2206020	Give me the pencil.
2206020	2208020	There we go.
2208020	2210020	I saved it.
2210020	2212020	I saved it.
2212020	2214020	Baby, give you a lot more time
2214020	2216020	for the second one.
2216020	2218020	Yeah, you're to finish it.
2218020	2220020	Ah, you need to finish it.
2220020	2222020	Okay, I'm fucking stupid, never mind.
2222020	2224020	Okay.
2224020	2226020	So am I, don't worry. Saved it.
2226020	2228020	Let me look at it.
2228020	2230020	Help.
2230020	2232020	Let's put some nice shading in.
2232020	2234020	To make this look extra beautiful.
2234020	2236020	Wow.
2236020	2238020	Let's put lipstick on.
2238020	2240020	Beautiful.
2240020	2242020	Yeah.
2242020	2244020	So beautiful.
2246020	2248020	I saved it.
2252020	2254020	They prank him.
2254020	2256020	I think this is the best one.
2256020	2258020	Maybe a better one.
2258020	2260020	Oh, wait.
2260020	2262020	Who drew a pair of hairy ballsack?
2262020	2264020	Come on.
2264020	2266020	What the fuck?
2266020	2268020	What the fuck?
2270020	2272020	You have to add the shaft.
2276020	2278020	I really know what I want to do,
2278020	2280020	but I know I shouldn't do it
2280020	2282020	because we're on YouTube.
2282020	2284020	I'm missing this.
2284020	2286020	Oh, no.
2288020	2290020	I can't make one thing.
2290020	2292020	This is amazing.
2292020	2294020	Oh, wait, maybe. Hold on.
2294020	2296020	I got it.
2296020	2298020	I got it.
2298020	2300020	I got it.
2300020	2302020	I gotta go back.
2314020	2316020	This is so fucking good.
2316020	2318020	Let's fucking go.
2320020	2322020	I'm trying so hard right now.
2322020	2324020	I can't even think of anything to say.
2324020	2326020	I'm like trying so hard.
2330020	2332020	Oh, my gosh. Use your imagination.
2334020	2336020	Use your imagination.
2344020	2346020	There you go.
2346020	2348020	I'm so proud of you.
2352020	2354020	Aww.
2354020	2356020	Refling.
2356020	2358020	We need to be nice to the camera.
2358020	2360020	Your laugh is so fucking lazy.
2360020	2362020	Thank you.
2362020	2364020	I got you a six.
2368020	2370020	I think they did my really well.
2372020	2374020	Yeah, it's a water bottle.
2378020	2380020	That's the best I got.
2382020	2382920	Quick quick quick.
2382920	2384580	I saved the pair of mall sacs.
2391080	2393720	Did you make it into a dog or something?
2393720	2395580	No, it just works.
2395580	2398860	Can you, Senpais, can you do better, shut the fuck up.
2401700	2402800	I love when you do that.
2402800	2403720	Shut the fuck up.
2403720	2405800	Oh my God.
2405800	2407800	What is this?
2407800	2409800	What is this?
2409800	2411800	I got the hairy mall facts.
2411800	2413800	What?
2413800	2415800	Hold on. Give me a second.
2415800	2417800	You're asking me not to draw a vagina.
2417800	2419800	What do I do here?
2419800	2421800	How am I supposed to do this?
2421800	2423800	What can we do here?
2423800	2425800	What can we do here?
2425800	2427800	How do I make this?
2427800	2429800	How do I save this?
2429800	2431800	Hmm.
2431800	2433800	Uh...
2433800	2435800	Hmm.
2435800	2437800	Hmm.
2437800	2439800	Hmm.
2439800	2441800	Okay.
2441800	2443800	Okay, I won't draw that.
2443800	2445800	Because that would be...
2445800	2447800	Oh my god. I just realized...
2447800	2449800	I'll draw this in the sky.
2449800	2451800	Mercy snippets of like fucking Grogu.
2451800	2453800	Hmm.
2453800	2455800	From Star Wars.
2455800	2457800	Oh wait, no. Is it heartbreak on the chair?
2457800	2459800	I did it! Saved it!
2459800	2461800	I saved it!
2461800	2463800	Women were less immature than men.
2463800	2465800	You're wrong.
2469800	2471800	I was gonna draw a coochie or a woman giving birth,
2471800	2473800	but I'm not gonna...
2473800	2475800	I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
2475800	2477800	I literally don't know what the fuck I'm doing right now.
2477800	2479800	There you go.
2479800	2481800	Wait, hold on.
2481800	2483800	Oh my god, I have time.
2483800	2485800	One, two, three.
2485800	2487800	I guess who it is now.
2487800	2489800	I can do this.
2489800	2491800	What the fuck I'm doing?
2491800	2493800	Fuck!
2501800	2503800	And then pen pals.
2503800	2505800	Pen pals.
2505800	2507800	Fuck.
2507800	2509800	Pen pals.
2509800	2511800	I'm running out of time.
2515800	2517800	Oh my god, this is...
2517800	2519800	And then volcano.
2523800	2525800	These are light ones.
2529800	2531800	I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.
2531800	2533800	I got it, I got it, I got it.
2535800	2537800	Fuck!
2537800	2539800	Are you out of...
2539800	2541800	I don't know, I don't know.
2541800	2543800	These are light ones!
2543800	2545800	I did it.
2545800	2547800	Oh god, refunds.
2547800	2549800	Refunds, how could I forget your...
2551800	2553800	I saved it, I saved it!
2553800	2555800	I think I did a good job.
2555800	2557800	This is the best I got.
2557800	2559800	I ain't got nothing.
2559800	2561800	No!
2563800	2565800	I don't like this.
2565800	2567800	Why do I feel like...
2567800	2571800	This is a really specific reference.
2571800	2573800	I don't know if anyone's gonna get it,
2573800	2576800	but there used to be a flash game
2576800	2579800	where your guy was on like a snowboard.
2579800	2581800	I love that game!
2581800	2583800	Yeah, someone should literally just drawn that.
2583800	2585800	Literally, this is perfect.
2593800	2595800	That's my drawing.
2595800	2597800	Someone says lane raider.
2597800	2599800	Oh, is that what it's called?
2601800	2603800	Rift.
2603800	2605800	Rift.
2605800	2607800	Rift.
2611800	2613800	What is bear pantsu?
2613800	2615800	Oh!
2615800	2617800	Panties.
2617800	2619800	Panties.
2621800	2623800	I don't want to weigh all of this.
2623800	2627800	People were asking me to draw a bear wearing underwear.
2627800	2629800	I was like, what the fuck is wrong with you guys?
2629800	2631800	Panties and pants.
2631800	2633800	I remember fancy pants.
2633800	2637800	Because he had big old pants that were fancy.
2639800	2641800	Rain up and now it's not the time.
2641800	2643800	And you know the story!
2643800	2645800	Is he blundered or did I make that up?
2645800	2647800	You know the story!
2649800	2651800	I might make that up.
2651800	2653800	I might make that up.
2657800	2659800	Wait, hydration check, girl.
2659800	2661800	Is that a one-year-old dying?
2661800	2663800	Okay.
2663800	2665800	You know the story.
2669800	2671800	His pants read.
2671800	2673800	He's gargling my balls, sorry.
2673800	2675800	He had no hair color, but his pants read yellow.
2677800	2679800	Did he have a beard? I don't know.
2679800	2681800	I'm going to do something.
2685800	2687800	Needs hip dial.
2687800	2689800	Yeah, you're right.
2689800	2691800	I don't really know how to do that though.
2691800	2693800	Can I zoom in?
2695800	2697800	Yeah!
2699800	2701800	Something with a beer braid.
2701800	2703800	Braid is pantsu?
2703800	2705800	Wait, it doesn't have pants?
2705800	2707800	Yeah!
2707800	2709800	No fuck, I didn't mean to have that.
2709800	2711800	What is this? Who drew ball sacks everywhere?
2713800	2715800	It's not you, Shibi.
2715800	2717800	I only see boobs.
2717800	2719800	No, I didn't draw a ball sack.
2723800	2725800	I got it.
2725800	2727800	Who's whispering?
2727800	2729800	What? I have no idea.
2729800	2731800	What? Who's whispering?
2731800	2733800	Who's whispering?
2733800	2735800	Who's whispering some evil incantations to us?
2739800	2741800	Wait, no, that's not nice.
2741800	2743800	This is all a C right now,
2743800	2745800	and I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.
2745800	2747800	It was definitely Azura that drew the ball sack, 100%.
2749800	2751800	Why do I feel like this is a lie?
2753800	2755800	No, I didn't draw it.
2755800	2757800	I'm really drawing over it right now.
2757800	2759800	If you guys didn't know,
2759800	2761800	Azura's ears actually have golden
2761800	2763800	little jewelry on the end of them.
2763800	2765800	Oh no.
2765800	2767800	This is icing.
2767800	2769800	She pimped out with jewelry, but it's like
2769800	2771800	not a vanity thing.
2771800	2773800	Here you go. Gifts.
2773800	2775800	Going for her first bike ride.
2775800	2777800	Right.
2777800	2779800	Isn't cheating to erase? Aw, fuck it is.
2779800	2781800	Isn't it cute?
2781800	2783800	Right.
2783800	2785800	So if you didn't know, when a woman
2785800	2787800	when a woman lactates,
2787800	2789800	she will have a...
2789800	2791800	I got it.
2791800	2793800	It goes through the fabric, okay?
2793800	2795800	So they'll be like a couple.
2799800	2801800	I know this isn't Azura's.
2801800	2803800	Aw, it's terrible.
2803800	2805800	Get rid of that.
2805800	2807800	Oh my god.
2807800	2809800	I want to live with my life.
2809800	2811800	I was trying to talk about lactation, though.
2815800	2817800	Yeah, it was right before she said chocolate.
2817800	2819800	Milk.
2819800	2821800	Milk.
2829800	2831800	The best I got.
2831800	2833800	Shit.
2833800	2835800	That's the timer.
2835800	2837800	Oh.
2839800	2841800	I thought you were drawing a cute bunny face.
2841800	2843800	Nah, they have some titties, mate.
2843800	2845800	It's all I can see.
2845800	2847800	I have saved...
2847800	2849800	I have single-handedly saved the stream, probably.
2849800	2851800	Let me do that.
2851800	2853800	This is supposed to be it.
2853800	2855800	The liquid.
2855800	2857800	The liquid.
2857800	2859800	Oh, I have to draw my own drawing?
2859800	2861800	Fine.
2861800	2863800	What is this?
2863800	2865800	That's nothing!
2865800	2867800	That's nothing!
2867800	2869800	Fine.
2869800	2871800	I don't even know what to draw for my own drawing.
2871800	2873800	Fine.
2873800	2875800	I started it,
2875800	2877800	and I'm going to finish it.
2877800	2879800	It's me.
2879800	2881800	Okay, fucking man over here.
2885800	2887800	I don't know.
2887800	2889800	I'm already pooped from this.
2889800	2891800	Just make a little snack.
2891800	2893800	Just a little snack.
2893800	2895800	A little whip.
2897800	2899800	It's the old...
2899800	2901800	It's the old Mac, okay?
2903800	2905800	Okay.
2905800	2907800	Okay.
2907800	2909800	I would talk, but it takes too much brain power
2909800	2911800	to do this.
2911800	2913800	You're a little cheery.
2913800	2915800	And talk.
2915800	2917800	Get a little...
2923800	2925800	Yeah.
2925800	2927800	Yeah.
2928800	2930800	Stop!
2939800	2941800	This is a net.
2945800	2947800	Yeah.
2951800	2953800	Pretty good net.
2953800	2955800	Yeah.
2955800	2957800	I think I need to grab one.
2967800	2969800	How do you spell squelch?
2969800	2971800	Squelch?
2971800	2973800	Squelch?
2973800	2975800	Yeah.
2975800	2977800	Yeah.
2977800	2979800	Is it the arm that's going?
2979800	2981800	Oh my god.
2983800	2985800	Is it the reverse Amazon position
2985800	2987800	when the girls...
2987800	2989800	What are you drawing?
2989800	2991800	Reverse Amazon is like eBay?
2991800	2993800	Reverse Amazon is like eBay?
2993800	2995800	Yeah.
2995800	2997800	That's definitely what it's about.
3003800	3005800	Wait, any quicker?
3005800	3007800	Is it hydrate?
3007800	3009800	No!
3009800	3011800	Okay, let's see our albums.
3011800	3013800	Is anybody need to take a quick break
3013800	3015800	before...
3015800	3017800	I'm ready.
3017800	3019800	Let's go.
3019800	3021800	I'm ready.
3021800	3023800	Let's do this.
3023800	3025800	That was yours.
3025800	3027800	Okay, okay.
3031800	3033800	What the hell?
3033800	3035800	What?
3035800	3037800	Oh, he's...
3037800	3039800	Okay.
3039800	3041800	Okay.
3049800	3051800	Is it Orsor's hand?
3051800	3053800	Oh my god, I think it's the other...
3053800	3055800	Yeah, the other me.
3055800	3057800	Oh, that's so good.
3057800	3059800	What do you mean you're a bad artist?
3059800	3061800	That's a very good little bear.
3061800	3063800	That's beautiful.
3063800	3065800	That's good.
3065800	3067800	He got a border under the blanket and everything.
3069800	3071800	Oh, it's the artist.
3071800	3073800	Beautiful.
3077800	3079800	What else could I draw for this?
3079800	3081800	Oh, that's so cute.
3081800	3083800	That's so cute.
3083800	3085800	We're so, so cute.
3085800	3087800	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
3089800	3091800	Oh, die.
3091800	3093800	Die.
3097800	3099800	I like it.
3099800	3101800	I did it for his milk.
3101800	3103800	Open now.
3109800	3111800	Oh my god.
3111800	3113800	Oh my god.
3113800	3115800	I saved them.
3115800	3117800	I lied.
3117800	3119800	I didn't save the stream at all.
3119800	3121800	I was...
3121800	3123800	If I don't see a snail...
3123800	3125800	Oh my god.

3135800	3137800	It is.
3137800	3139800	I love replays.
3139800	3141800	Oh my god, that's so cute.
3141800	3143800	Oh.
3143800	3145800	And then there's me.
3145800	3147800	And then there's...
3147800	3149800	I was like, it makes me...
3149800	3151800	Oh my god.
3151800	3153800	Mine broke.
3153800	3155800	Oh my god.
3155800	3157800	Oh, that's so cute.
3157800	3159800	Oh.
3159800	3161800	How is he cute?
3161800	3163800	Yeah, that was cute.
3163800	3165800	He's a rat boy.
3165800	3167800	Oh my god.
3167800	3169800	Oh, that's so cute.
3169800	3171800	That's so cute.
3171800	3173800	Oh.
3173800	3175800	Oh my god.
3175800	3177800	That's so cute.
3177800	3179800	Oh.
3179800	3181800	Literally me.
3181800	3183800	That's me.
3183800	3185800	Oh.
3185800	3187800	That's mine.
3187800	3189800	Oh my god.
3189800	3191800	He's so bad.
3191800	3193800	I can't show that.
3193800	3195800	I see.
3195800	3197800	We'll do it me and the boys.
3197800	3199800	Oh, okay, okay.
3203800	3205800	Oh my god, that's so good.
3205800	3207800	Why the mono bro?
3207800	3209800	Wait.
3209800	3211800	Why are you guys...
3211800	3213800	Oh my god.
3215800	3217800	Really calm.
3217800	3219800	Wait, I drew this little game.
3219800	3221800	I was like, oh, this is a lane ranger.
3221800	3223800	I like it.
3223800	3225800	Oh, that's good.
3225800	3227800	That's creative.
3227800	3229800	Yeah, that's good.
3229800	3231800	Oh, I love that.
3231800	3233800	Oh.
3233800	3235800	That's really cute.
3235800	3237800	I love that.
3237800	3239800	Oh, that's cute.
3241800	3243800	I told you.
3243800	3245800	I told you.
3245800	3247800	I told you.
3247800	3249800	I love you.
3249800	3251800	What is this?
3251800	3253800	Lama Chuba for Gentoo.
3253800	3255800	I was gonna say that's a good one
3255800	3257800	and then I saw the thing on the right.
3259800	3261800	That's cute, Mercy.
3267800	3269800	I told you.
3269800	3271800	She's learning how to ride a bike.
3273800	3275800	What the fuck?
3275800	3277800	Oh, that was good.
3277800	3279800	Oh, that was so fucking good.
3279800	3281800	I ended up being the most innocent.
3281800	3283800	Oh, that was good.
3283800	3285800	Oh my god.
3285800	3287800	Time and stuff.
3287800	3289800	Help.
3289800	3291800	I can't breathe.
3295800	3297800	This is what it's like to be in VLR.
3297800	3299800	So fucking giving birth!
3301800	3303800	I want to figure out what icebreaker is.
3303800	3305800	Icebreaker is kind of boring.
3305800	3307800	What are we doing?
3307800	3309800	I'll stop it.
3309800	3311800	What are we doing?
3311800	3313800	What?
3313800	3315800	Icebreaker is kind of boring.
3315800	3317800	Yeah, it's boring.
3317800	3319800	Can I cancel it?
3319800	3321800	If you want.
3321800	3323800	How do I cancel it?
3323800	3325800	Wait, are we doing this or are we cancelling it?
3325800	3327800	I don't know.
3327800	3329800	I cancel it.
3329800	3331800	What is happening?
3331800	3333800	What is happening?
3333800	3335800	Oh, there's a fucking ad.
3335800	3337800	I'm just making another room.
3337800	3339800	I'm making another room.
3339800	3341800	Okay, okay, okay.
3341800	3343800	All right.
3343800	3345800	Where is my carrier that?
3345800	3347800	You guys can see John Snow and Sansa start.
3349800	3351800	Wait, no, you put me back in.
3351800	3353800	They still advertise.
3355800	3357800	Wait, so do we have a new one?
3357800	3359800	Do we have a new one?
3359800	3361800	Yeah, it says one of seven.
3361800	3363800	Wait, what is happening?
3363800	3365800	I don't know what is happening.
3365800	3367800	Somebody else make a lobby.
3367800	3369800	It's not the greatest, but we can just play it.
3369800	3371800	No, somebody else make a lobby.
3373800	3375800	Do we have a new lobby or not?
3375800	3377800	Somebody else make it because
3377800	3379800	I made a new one.
3379800	3381800	I was trying to make a new one.
3381800	3383800	Everyone, hate the asset.
3383800	3385800	Hate the game.
3385800	3387800	The graphic phone window.
3387800	3389800	And then someone make a new one.
3389800	3391800	I can't make it because of my connections.
3391800	3393800	I'll do it.
3393800	3395800	Okay.
3395800	3397800	See, Emmy proven what a big girl she is.
3397800	3399800	That was so fucking weird.
3399800	3401800	I'm sorry.
3401800	3403800	So fucking creepy.
3403800	3405800	I'm so sorry.
3405800	3407800	Sorry.
3407800	3409800	It's so chaotic.
3409800	3411800	I don't know why there's two of me on the screen.
3411800	3413800	I hate that.
3413800	3415800	I hate that.
3415800	3417800	So we are opening in your lobby?
3417800	3419800	I hate that.
3419800	3421800	Let me just put up a new one.
3421800	3423800	She was a link in the discord, you can hate.
3423800	3425800	Okay, okay, okay.
3425800	3427800	I understand.
3427800	3429800	Okay.
3429800	3431800	Understood.
3431800	3433800	So, yes sir.
3433800	3435800	Let me open the link.
3435800	3437800	There we go, nice and easy.
3437800	3439800	I'll go Apecha.
3439800	3441800	Okay, is everyone here?
3441800	3443800	I'm here.
3443800	3445800	I'm here.
3445800	3447800	Yeah, we're here.
3447800	3449800	Okay, which one do you want to play?
3449800	3451800	I don't know.
3451800	3453800	Knock off is fun.
3453800	3455800	Because it's like, super...
3455800	3457800	Try to replicate the drawing.
3457800	3459800	Oh yeah, do knock off.
3459800	3461800	Do knock off, that looks good.
3461800	3463800	Okay.
3463800	3465800	Because you make it pretty drawing and then
3465800	3467800	it becomes hell.
3467800	3469800	Wait, why are we supposed to draw?
3469800	3471800	Anything you want.
3471800	3473800	Anything?
3473800	3475800	No, not you.
3475800	3477800	Maybe not anything for you.
3477800	3479800	No, not shit.
3479800	3481800	Please give us something.
3481800	3483800	I'm being put on the spot, my main's going blank.
3483800	3485800	Okay, hold on.
3485800	3487800	Let's do a count.
3487800	3489800	Cheebie, we can't see.
3489800	3491800	I'll draw.
3491800	3493800	I'm taking off the blindfold or fine now.
3493800	3495800	I'll draw Cheebie.
3495800	3497800	Should we all just draw somebody?
3497800	3499800	Oh.
3499800	3501800	No, I'm joking.
3501800	3503800	I was like, ooh, I'm kind of locked in now.
3503800	3505800	Sorry, sorry.
3505800	3507800	I've decided to draw one of us
3507800	3509800	that I have already said out loud.
3509800	3511800	I don't know what to draw.
3511800	3513800	Guys, give me an idea.
3513800	3515800	Don't put me on the spot.
3515800	3517800	Don't put me on the spot, I don't know.
3517800	3519800	I don't even know what to draw.
3519800	3521800	Put me on the G-spot.
3521800	3523800	Oh, one of you guys, so I'm going to choose.
3523800	3525800	Yeah.
3525800	3527800	Are you coming for a ride?
3529800	3531800	This is terrible on a mouse.
3533800	3535800	That one's actually funny.
3537800	3539800	How much time do we have?
3539800	3541800	Can I draw the whole gang again?
3541800	3543800	I'll make it.
3543800	3545800	You have quite a bit of time with this one.
3545800	3547800	Okay, hold on.
3547800	3549800	What the fuck is the whole gang with this?
3549800	3551800	Oh, that's not very...
3555800	3557800	No, no, no, no.
3561800	3563800	How the fuck do you draw something sitting down?
3563800	3565800	Oh my God, I'm having a stroke.
3565800	3567800	I'm not a good guy.
3567800	3569800	What on earth?
3569800	3571800	There's a good kind?
3571800	3573800	I'm supposed to be at the very...
3575800	3577800	That's close enough.
3577800	3579800	How do you say after this?
3579800	3581800	Oh my God.
3581800	3583800	Oh my God.
3583800	3585800	I'm going to draw harmony.
3585800	3587800	I'm going to draw your name.
3589800	3591800	Perfect. I can't draw like this.
3591800	3593800	Wait, it has kind of like...
3593800	3595800	His nickname.
3595800	3597800	We need to draw the devilish hat.
3599800	3601800	Fuck.
3601800	3603800	This is hard because I don't know what to fucking draw.
3605800	3607800	Get creative, nerds.
3607800	3609800	Jeez, it's not that hard.
3609800	3611800	I'm doing it.
3611800	3613800	I'm playing dead, okay?
3613800	3615800	Okay, Miss Artis.
3615800	3617800	I'm playing dead.
3619800	3621800	I'm just going to draw myself casual
3621800	3623800	and it comes out with this fucking banger of a commission.
3623800	3625800	It would probably cost like $500 to do.
3627800	3629800	And I'm like, oh my God.
3631800	3633800	I'm going to make a VTuber model.
3635800	3637800	Don't ask the way.
3637800	3639800	I wish I could...
3639800	3641800	I'm doing a figure-nerval talent.
3641800	3643800	Speaking of that,
3643800	3645800	send me a fucking marshmallow.
3645800	3647800	They were like, thank you for not tying down
3647800	3649800	your talents to the designs
3649800	3651800	that you assigned them and they can be more themselves.
3651800	3653800	And I'm like, yeah, well,
3653800	3655800	why would I do that?
3655800	3657800	I was like, I don't know why.
3657800	3659800	I feel like it's such a basic thing.
3659800	3661800	What the fuck do I need to draw next?
3661800	3663800	A bleeding heart.
3663800	3665800	Yeah, we're more like building upon
3665800	3667800	characters rather than
3667800	3669800	changing everything.
3671800	3673800	Oh, someone rated the VTuber.
3673800	3675800	They were like, the only thing that would have
3675800	3677800	been better is if you let them design
3677800	3679800	their models.
3679800	3681800	From the start, I'm like, bro, it took me
3681800	3683800	a fucking year to get here.
3683800	3685800	Oh my God, give me...
3685800	3687800	It takes forever to...
3687800	3689800	It is not like an overnight thing.
3689800	3691800	Draw and rig a VTuber model.
3691800	3693800	You can ask Amy.
3693800	3695800	She knows how to do it.
3695800	3697800	It's a lot of work.
3697800	3699800	Oh my God.
3701800	3703800	Yeah, there's only a select few corpos
3703800	3705800	that will let you do that.
3705800	3707800	It literally takes a little long.
3707800	3709800	Oh shit. Oh shit.
3709800	3711800	Man, this is rough.
3711800	3713800	Usually ones that have like artists in house
3713800	3715800	are like...
3715800	3717800	Yeah, we don't.
3717800	3719800	This is so bad.
3719800	3721800	Most companies, if not all of them,
3721800	3723800	say first, you
3723800	3725800	will have
3725800	3727800	pre-made
3727800	3729800	pre-made.
3729800	3731800	So it's not actually standard
3731800	3733800	for people to choose.
3733800	3735800	Yeah, it's really not.
3735800	3737800	That's why it's usually they
3737800	3739800	cast for the roles.
3739800	3741800	You have to fit the character they're looking for
3741800	3743800	and have the voice.
3753800	3755800	Oh.
3755800	3757800	There.
3757800	3759800	What the fuck is that?
3759800	3761800	Stop.
3761800	3763800	Oh, it looks like an abomination.
3765800	3767800	Oh.
3767800	3769800	Oh no.
3769800	3771800	I'm complicated.
3771800	3773800	What is this?
3773800	3775800	Fuck.
3775800	3777800	Okay.
3777800	3779800	I like how cute this is.
3779800	3781800	Okay.
3781800	3783800	Okay, now we have to draw it.
3783800	3785800	Are we ready?
3785800	3787800	Yeah.
3787800	3789800	No, but...
3789800	3791800	I have to be...
3791800	3793800	I have to be ready for it.
3793800	3795800	Even if I'm not...
3795800	3797800	It's okay.
3797800	3799800	Just draw it your way
3799800	3801800	and that's the fun part.
3801800	3803800	Yeah. Very nice.
3805800	3807800	I've already forgot which position everyone...
3808800	3810800	Fuck.
3810800	3812800	Bro, this is so bad.
3816800	3818800	Sorry, we flinched honestly.
3818800	3820800	I would talk more, but this takes so much brain power
3820800	3822800	to do this.
3822800	3824800	I'm so brain dead.
3824800	3826800	I feel so bad.
3826800	3828800	I'm like dying.
3828800	3830800	I'm reading chat, I'm reading everything,
3830800	3832800	but I'm not responding.
3832800	3834800	I'm so sorry.
3834800	3836800	I can see everyone and see what you're all saying.
3836800	3838800	I'm just really in this.
3840800	3842800	I feel like I'm just...
3842800	3844800	Fuck, I'm just fucking losing it.
3847800	3849800	Oh my god, wait!
3849800	3851800	I forgot there was a shorter time!
3851800	3853800	Fuck!
3853800	3855800	That's far too short, so it's...
3855800	3857800	This is why it's chaotic.
3857800	3859800	Why was the other one longer?
3859800	3861800	I don't remember what...
3867800	3869800	Ah!
3869800	3871800	Oh my god, what?
3871800	3873800	What is this?
3873800	3875800	Okay.
3875800	3877800	Okay.
3877800	3879800	I have no clue what it was.
3879800	3881800	Okay, okay, okay.
3881800	3883800	Okay.
3883800	3885800	Fuck, the time!
3885800	3888800	We draw this as fast as we can.
3889800	3891800	Oh fuck!
3891800	3893800	Ah!
3894800	3896800	No, no, no, no!
3896800	3898800	Not like this!
3898800	3900800	Shit, shit, shit!
3900800	3902800	I can't remember what it looked like.
3903800	3906800	Is there supposed to be someone in a pirate boat, by the way?
3906800	3908800	Because I don't think I saw it.
3908800	3910800	Is there supposed to be a person in it?
3910800	3912800	I don't know, it's already gone.
3912800	3914800	It's just a person.
3914800	3916800	It's supposed to...
3916800	3918800	It's supposed to go really fast, so it...
3918800	3920800	Oh my god!
3920800	3923800	Okay, that's easy enough.
3923800	3926800	That's easy enough.
3926800	3928800	Oh, it's already up!
3928800	3930800	Okay.
3930800	3932800	Gotta go fast, gotta go fast!
3932800	3934800	Gotta go fast!
3934800	3936800	Faster, faster, oh fuck.
3936800	3938800	Faster, faster!
3938800	3940800	Ah!
3940800	3943800	Oh my god, I am so sorry.
3943800	3945800	Come on.
3945800	3947800	Faster, oh!
3947800	3949800	Faster!
3949800	3951800	Faster!
3951800	3953800	Ah!
3953800	3955800	Okay, okay, okay.
3955800	3957800	Oh, hey, it's me.
3957800	3959800	Why is it so flat?
3959800	3961800	Oh no, no, no!
3961800	3964800	Okay, okay, okay, okay, we can do this, we can do this.
3964800	3966800	We can do this.
3966800	3968800	Okay, okay, okay.
3968800	3970800	Let's go, let's go, let's go.
3970800	3972800	Don't panic, don't panic.
3973800	3976800	The great part is that we are all panicking.
3977800	3980800	Oh no, no, no, no!
3980800	3982800	One more time.
3982800	3984800	One more time.
3984800	3986800	What is this?
3986800	3988800	What even is that?
3991800	3994800	Okay, this is easy, this is easy, easy, easy.
3994800	3997800	This has to be mittens, this has to be mittens.
3997800	3999800	Easy, easy, easy.
3999800	4001800	Was it blue? I can't remember blue.
4001800	4003800	Let's fucking go.
4004800	4007800	Man, this looks like shade, but oh wow.
4011800	4014800	I mean, that's close enough.
4014800	4016800	Oh my god.
4016800	4018800	That's close enough.
4024800	4026800	Oh my god.
4026800	4028800	That's amazing.
4028800	4030800	I love this.
4033800	4036800	What does her have all the time?
4036800	4039800	I did not have any time for this.
4039800	4041800	I was like, this is Mr. Min.
4041800	4043800	This is Mr. Min.
4043800	4045800	At least it's me and the cat.
4045800	4047800	Oh my god.
4047800	4049800	I'm excited to cat.
4049800	4052800	That's a little campfire with all of us together.
4052800	4054800	That's fucking cute.
4054800	4057800	That's a little campfire with all of us together.
4057800	4060800	That's a little campfire with all of us together.
4061800	4063800	That's fucking cute.
4063800	4065800	I don't have time.
4065800	4067800	I don't have time.
4067800	4069800	That's what it's supposed to be.
4069800	4071800	I'm stuck.
4071800	4073800	I'm stuck in the face.
4073800	4075800	I'm stuck in the face.
4075800	4077800	I'm stuck in the face.
4084800	4086800	I'm stuck in the face.
4086800	4088800	I'm stuck in the face.
4088800	4089800	I'm stuck in the face.
4092800	4094800	That's so good.
4094800	4095800	At the end of the day,
4095800	4097800	we're all just suffering here.
4099800	4101800	This is good.
4101800	4102800	This stayed good.
4111800	4114800	That's perfect circle.
4118800	4130440	I was getting more and more depressed, somebody said.
4130440	4133880	Oh, she's not in jail.
4133880	4135920	She's at the cage.
4135920	4138240	I thought she was in jail.
4138240	4139720	OK, that's fine.
4139720	4140720	I get it.
4140720	4143200	Oh, my god.
4143200	4144680	She was under arrest.
4149400	4153400	I love this.
4153400	4156400	Help.
4156400	4158400	It's back down.
4158400	4161800	She broke her jail by the end.
4161800	4163800	Oh, my goodness.
4163800	4166800	She's free.
4166800	4167800	Wow.
4167800	4169800	I love all the details.
4169800	4170800	One piece.
4170800	4173800	I was like, why the heck are we doing this?
4173800	4176800	I was like, what the heck are we doing here?
4176800	4182800	I was like, stop me.
4182800	4183800	Oh, no.
4186800	4188800	I was just getting ugly.
4188800	4191800	I was trying to draw the line.
4191800	4192800	Oh, my god.
4195800	4197800	I was trying to draw the line on it.
4203800	4205800	I was like, I can't.
4206800	4209800	I was like, oh.
4212800	4216800	She was shooting her piss.
4216800	4218800	Wait, that's supposed to be me?
4218800	4220800	Are you kissing as a girl?
4223800	4228800	You're giving the rest of the piss it needs to serve her?
4228800	4231800	The piss will revive him.
4231800	4232800	Oh.
4232800	4235800	The piss will revive him.
4236800	4239800	Oh, my god.
4244800	4246800	Oh, it's still good, right?
4246800	4247800	One more.
4247800	4248800	One more.
4248800	4249800	Which one?
4249800	4251800	One more.
4251800	4253800	Give us one more.
4253800	4255800	One more.
4255800	4257800	One more.
4257800	4260800	What would have we not done?
4260800	4262800	I don't know.
4262800	4263800	I don't remember.
4263800	4264800	Secret.
4264800	4265800	All the actions are a mystery.
4265800	4268800	Drawing incentives are hitting during the game.
4268800	4270800	What's secret?
4270800	4272800	Secret seems rough.
4272800	4275800	I've never done that one before.
4275800	4276800	All right, since they're a mystery.
4276800	4277800	OK.
4277800	4278800	We'll try it.
4278800	4279800	We'll try it.
4279800	4280800	Last friend, boys.
4280800	4281800	Last friend.
4281800	4284800	OK, OK, OK.
4284800	4285800	Oh, shit.
4285800	4286800	Oh, what?
4286800	4287800	I can't see what I'm writing.
4287800	4288800	Oh, secret.
4288800	4290800	How am I supposed to know what I'm writing?
4290800	4292800	Wait, what?
4292800	4295800	Huh?
4295800	4296800	Yeah.
4296800	4297800	Oh, no, wait.
4297800	4299800	You run out of freaking words?
4299800	4300800	Oh, bro.
4300800	4302800	I can't erase my things.
4302800	4304800	I don't know.
4304800	4308800	What is this?
4308800	4310800	Of course.
4310800	4312800	What is this?
4312800	4314800	What is happening?
4314800	4316800	It just appears.
4316800	4319800	Oh, we can't see what we're drawing.
4319800	4320800	What?
4320800	4321800	OK, we'll draw fast.
4321800	4322800	We'll draw fast.
4322800	4324800	What the fuck?
4324800	4327800	OK.
4327800	4328800	OK.
4328800	4329800	I don't know.
4329800	4335800	I think I'm going to just guess what it is, where it is.
4335800	4336800	That's so funny.
4336800	4337800	Oh, god.
4337800	4340800	What the fuck?
4340800	4346800	Oh, no, no.
4346800	4347800	I'm going to try to draw.
4347800	4349800	Why is it so hard to draw with a bow?
4349800	4351800	What is that?
4351800	4354800	OK.
4354800	4359800	OK.
4359800	4360800	OK.
4360800	4361800	I failed that.
4361800	4362800	Oh, no.
4362800	4365800	I didn't finish it.
4365800	4366800	Oh, come on.
4366800	4368800	What the fuck?
4368800	4370800	What?
4370800	4373800	What does that even mean?
4373800	4374800	What the fuck?
4374800	4375800	What does that even mean?
4375800	4377800	What the fuck?
4377800	4379800	I think it's so sad.
4379800	4380800	OK.
4380800	4381800	OK.
4381800	4382800	OK.
4382800	4384800	Oh, fuck.
4384800	4385800	Oh, fuck.
4385800	4386800	I don't know what else to draw.
4386800	4392800	That's exactly what I drew, I think.
4392800	4394800	Is this a vain reference?
4394800	4397800	I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
4397800	4399800	Locked in.
4399800	4400800	I locked in.
4400800	4401800	Did I give...
4401800	4402800	Wait, I spelled that wrong.
4402800	4404800	Wait, did I give them bodies?
4405800	4406800	Oh, my God.
4406800	4408800	I don't even know where they are.
4408800	4410800	I don't know.
4410800	4412800	Taking a shot in the dark.
4412800	4415800	Where do you know what that is going to be interpreted as?
4415800	4418800	And will I stop the creative flow?
4418800	4420800	Do you stop?
4420800	4421800	Oh, my God.
4421800	4422800	No.
4422800	4423800	Emmy's got a hoodie here.
4423800	4424800	Oh, sugar.
4424800	4425800	I don't...
4425800	4426800	Fucking...
4426800	4428800	I put juice on her right now.
4431800	4433800	I don't fucking know.
4433800	4437800	I didn't even know what the fuck I'm doing anymore.
4437800	4439800	I'm fucking dying.
4439800	4441800	What is this?
4441800	4443800	What is this?
4443800	4445800	What is this?
4445800	4447800	What?
4447800	4449800	What is happening?
4449800	4451800	What is this?
4451800	4452800	Someone had a stroke.
4452800	4454800	Could you ever do this one?
4454800	4455800	Hope you're feeling OK.
4455800	4456800	Hope you're doing all right.
4456800	4458800	Make sure you hydrate.
4458800	4460800	Fuck, I didn't have enough time to write it.
4460800	4462800	Oh, man.
4462800	4465800	How do I even draw this?
4465800	4467800	This is...
4469800	4472800	That's the tongue.
4472800	4476800	This is literally everywhere.
4476800	4478800	Wait.
4481800	4483800	Okay, this is so difficult.
4483800	4486800	Fuck am I drawing?
4493800	4496800	I need like motion swipes as well.
4496800	4498800	And a little arrow to indicate.
4498800	4500800	I don't know what I'm doing.
4500800	4502800	I don't know.
4502800	4503800	Yeah, there we go.
4503800	4505800	I think I drew it correctly.
4505800	4506800	A little bit of lips.
4506800	4508800	Cute?
4508800	4509800	Cute?
4509800	4510800	I don't know.
4510800	4511800	I just drew anything.
4511800	4513800	I don't know.
4513800	4515800	I don't know what I'm doing.
4515800	4517800	I just drew everything.
4517800	4518800	What did you say?
4518800	4521800	I can't wait to see the end of this.
4521800	4523800	Yeah, you're all in trouble.
4523800	4525800	This is going to be something else.
4525800	4528800	This is going to be fucking interesting.
4528800	4530800	What's going on in the ceiling?
4530800	4532800	Oh, I need to draw on the ceiling quick.
4532800	4533800	Oh, I think I just drew it.
4533800	4534800	Oh, God.
4534800	4535800	Oh, boy.
4535800	4537800	I'm so scared of what these look like.
4537800	4539800	Same.
4540800	4542800	Are you serious?
4542800	4544800	What the fuck?
4549800	4550800	Oh, my God.
4550800	4552800	I think she's beautiful.
4552800	4555800	I was like, oh, you're not okay.
4555800	4557800	I completely missed the book.
4557800	4559800	She's fucking going.
4559800	4561800	What are you doing?
4561800	4565800	I was going to write.
4565800	4570800	I was going to write even being cooked.
4570800	4575800	It looked like she was on a stick that's rotating.
4575800	4577800	No.
4577800	4587800	Oh, that's why you were humming Indiana Jones.
4587800	4590800	I was like, where did that come from?
4590800	4594800	I was trying to write cowboy, but I didn't fit it.
4594800	4597800	Oh, that's so normal.
4597800	4599800	I'm kidding.
4602800	4605800	Wait, where's my coin?
4605800	4607800	Oh, my God.
4607800	4621800	I used the color black and I used red as well.
4621800	4623800	And orange.
4623800	4625800	Oh, my God.
4625800	4627800	What is my one?
4627800	4629800	What the fuck?
4629800	4631800	I can't read.
4631800	4633800	Oh, my face.
4633800	4635800	Snowcow.
4635800	4637800	Hey.
4637800	4639800	How are you?
4639800	4641800	Wait, wait, wait.
4641800	4643800	Oh, my God.
