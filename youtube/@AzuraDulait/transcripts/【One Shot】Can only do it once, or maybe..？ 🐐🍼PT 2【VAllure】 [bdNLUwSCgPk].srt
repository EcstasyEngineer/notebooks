today

218
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,080
i'm still a little bit upset though i guess i'm a little still upset

219
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:39,080
i want to see i want to see violence i want to see fighting i want to see blood murder

220
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:59,080
you know i want to see that i want to see that it's none of that it's none of that it's not fair

221
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:12,200
it's not much talking it's actually some action it's pretty pretty actiony right now in the last two episodes yeah

222
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:22,200
pretty actiony but just not the action that i i was expecting i'll put it that way

223
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,120
it's definitely not what i was expecting it was expecting more a little more than what they gave us

224
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,120
what they provided us

225
00:28:48,440 --> 00:29:05,800
i i like tower of god don't get me wrong i've read the comic the comic is amazing

226
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:15,480
great comic i do not like the anime anime was trash

227
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:26,840
the animation amazing but the pacing they ruined it they removed so much plot

228
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:33,720
that it was unnecessary where's the plot they removed so much they changed stuff to make it fit

229
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:43,400
and it and it didn't make sense i don't i like the comic it's really good anime it's really bad

230
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,800
no hate towards it it's really good you should read it it's really good

231
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:06,440
it's not gonna be no season two it got a lot of hate got a lot of hate i'd be surprised if

232
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:13,560
there was a season two honestly if there is i'm surprised i'd be there's no season

233
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:36,120
my expectations i've been lowered now

234
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,640
it skips a lot it's the same thing with um what anime was that

235
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:55,960
that school school of god oh brain come on brain you got this

236
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,440
i can't nope can't think of it

237
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:10,760
but

238
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:26,760
the god of high school ha ha hey got it yeah yeah brain yeah

239
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:42,760
ha ha

240
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,880
and the same goes for the god of high school they changed quite a bit in there too they mushed

241
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:54,600
a lot of episodes together they they ruined the plot in there as well in the anime comic amazing

242
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:01,160
i i read up to like there's like i read up to like 600 chapters i i lost track

243
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:07,720
but it was really good it was really good really good comic it derails a lot sometimes

244
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:14,840
but hey it's all right but they mushed so much together they mushed so much together

245
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:20,600
they look mashing and it ruined it for me so i didn't want to watch it plus the opening is really

246
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:26,840
weird i know a lot of people like idiom i love idiom i don't get me wrong i love idiom i love a lot

247
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,360
i like that want want you know you know

248
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:47,160
but the the opening does not match the theme of the anime itself it was really weird

249
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:56,280
combination so i couldn't really get into it like i really like music so like an anime theme music

250
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:04,760
needs to like really really really like draw me and draw me and take me and

251
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:09,720
take me take me take me take me you know but it didn't take me it didn't take me at all

252
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:17,400
then like it didn't like it not one bit it was a good song though it would have been really good for

253
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:26,600
like a like a like a mecca anime or a or like a half kind of like android-y like futuristic kind of anime

254
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:33,400
you know it would have been really nice for that like it would have got you really in it like oh it's crazy

255
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:45,560
i like that i like that i like that so much yeah yeah oh yeah yeah sort of like sci-fi yeah

256
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:55,160
but uh it wasn't it wasn't like that it didn't fit the theme of the anime at all so i couldn't get into it

257
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,560
you've been watching this house needs a classroom yeah it's good i like it i even like the

258
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:14,040
second season i think they did a really good job with uh each season i like it it's really good

259
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:21,160
they really and they don't derail from the plot like even them even the filler episodes are still like

260
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:27,240
with the plot of the anime itself so yeah it's all funny and they're all fun and games and

261
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:33,720
ha ha he but it doesn't like you don't lose the story it doesn't become like a random filler

262
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:39,720
whereas like random the plot still stays the same so it's really good

263
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:48,200
yeah it's the alien the yellow alien teacher yeah yeah yeah

264
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:59,560
oh i love trigon um i really do who's one of my favorite one of my favorite

265
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:14,280
animes in the past i love all the oldies all the oldies i didn't watch the new trigon though

266
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,880
the new one that came out they did a remake or something or something like that i don't know if

267
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:27,640
it's a remake i just know they did read it and it's sort of sort of like cgi cgi ish i think cgi ish

268
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:34,040
i haven't watched it yet i heard i saw some clips and stuff and it was really amazing so it's on

269
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:40,440
my list to watch but i'm really nervous to watch og stuff because you know when you watch like really

270
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:47,400
old stuff it starts and you watch the remix of it it loses the charm it loses the charm that it

271
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:54,120
once had and it kind of makes me sad so i'm a little afraid a little afraid to

272
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,480
so you don't have into that into that

273
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:23,240
i also love the art style of kiju number kiju number haven't uh really watched it yet though

274
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:33,400
but i've seen also like i really like gathering seasonal anime like my habit is i gather

275
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:40,920
and then i can pick which ones i've been dying to watch and which ones i really want to watch

276
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:47,560
based off the trailer and i watch those first i binge like i stay up to date with those and then

277
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:53,480
i let the others sit in the back and like all i wait for all the episodes and stuff to come out

278
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,680
and then i binge those that's how i watch my anime

279
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,640
so there's some things i haven't watched yet and there's some things i'm sitting on and there's

280
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:09,080
some things i've been spoiled or like i stopped watching stuff i've been spoiled on and i wait

281
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:14,920
like a few weeks for my brain to forget and then i'll go back and watch it so yeah

282
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,720
it's okay you're not late there's no lateness here

283
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:32,120
i love binge watching but sometimes hard to wait it is very hard to wait it's very hard

284
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:41,160
i have i spoke about the spice and wolf one too i've seen the original i know the whole song of the

285
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:48,520
original the ending song i have not seen the new one yet

286
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:22,520
the world

287
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:52,520
and

288
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,080
yeah i like spice and wolf a lot oh it's quite a lot of anime

289
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:12,200
i'm surprised like it got to the point where i can no longer remember the anime i've watched

290
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:18,600
that's how bad it is i've watched too much anime even i can say that i've watched too much anime

291
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:25,160
way too much way too much that if someone were to ask me to give them a recommendation like on the spot

292
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:31,480
i wouldn't be able to think of any one anime that i'll only be able to say right away is a really good

293
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:38,840
starter anime is hunter x hunter that's it and then and then after that i'd probably name some new anime

294
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:49,080
i'm really bad at recommending anime because i can never remember any any uh

295
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:57,080
like i my brain likes to be like well what if they don't like old anime if you send them straight

296
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:03,880
away to old anime they might not watch it because of the art style and i know how new people are to anime

297
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:10,760
they will not watch something if the art looks stupid if it doesn't look like hd look clean or blah blah

298
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,680
no one will watch it no one will watch it yeah i used to recommend death no but like i said people don't

299
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:24,360
like the art style new people these new generations they don't like it they don't like the art style

300
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,720
they will not watch it so i stopped recommending it

301
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:41,160
but hunter x hunter is like really clean with their animation um uh the remake of hunter x hunter

302
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:49,000
the remake the remake uh and formal alchemist brotherhood yelp is also a good recommendation

303
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:58,520
but uh i just feel sad recommending full metal alchemist brotherhood only because the original is so good

304
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:06,280
it's so good because they don't like they give you the emotion emotional attachment to the characters

305
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:13,000
by doing the side stories by doing the other stuff brotherhood just takes that away to make it shorter

306
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,240
so that you only watch the main plot and the original the original ending

307
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:30,600
of full metal alchemist isn't canon sadly it isn't canon but apparently brotherhood's ending is canon

308
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:39,960
so that's that's what makes it sad so it's a little sloppy it's a little messy i like the original i like

309
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,600
feeling attachment to the characters i like feeling how they feel and so it's at work

310
00:41:44,680 --> 00:42:10,040
i hope you guys don't mind us just chilling out for a second

311
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,080
before we play one shot

312
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,280
never watch hunter x hunter you're missing out better get the watch in

313
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:32,680
missing out get the watch in right after stream though what right after stream not right now

314
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:45,000
yep spyax family is also a good recommendation but like i said spyax family is still a new anime

315
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,200
technically still a new anime just because of the season 2 does not make it an old anime it is brand new

316
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:59,000
it is brand new uh so it's you can only recommend anime that are like two years old to people now

317
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,480
because no one's gonna watch the old stuff if it's if the animation's not good

318
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,840
if the animation's not good they're not gonna watch it you know they're gonna be like

319
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:17,400
ah that's just trash that's trash artwork trash ah that's terrible terrible and then they'll

320
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,240
talk about how dbz is the main one that's amazing well nothing's on there's nothing on dbz

321
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,920
there's nothing on there don't get me wrong i like dbz i watch all of it even super even

322
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:41,640
super i watch it but that's literally what people say there's nothing on dbz like okay all right

323
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:50,040
okay i try i even it's it's starting to get sad that i recommend Naruto to people and people are like

324
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:58,680
like irl gross all because of the old artwork in the original when they were in the when they

325
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:03,240
were younger because that's why i tell them to watch first when they're younger and animation

326
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:13,160
when they were younger is it is a memory it's nostalgia all right

327
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:23,000
so tokyo gu is also a good starter that's true i also recommend that

328
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:30,520
that's a good starter if you haven't watched any anime tokyo gu tokyo gu uh however

329
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:36,680
i will say i always forget this i am only gonna say i like tokyo gu season one

330
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:47,960
i hate the fact that the next season like forces you to read the manga in order for you to be up to date

331
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:54,600
and i think that's dumb i think this is the dumbest thing any any any anime any show you have a tv show i don't

332
00:44:54,600 --> 00:45:00,360
care what show it is i don't care i don't care i don't care i don't care i don't i don't i don't care

333
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:11,880
i think it's the dumbest thing that any show could ever do why why why just add it add it in the end

334
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,120
season two that's the whole point of you making it into an anime so i could watch it with my eyeballs

335
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:23,800
with my eyeballs watch the animation with my eyeballs i want to see moving pictures i want

336
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:30,200
to see flashing lights i want to see all of it i i don't i don't i don't i don't like the fact that they

337
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:39,240
they force you to go read the manga and then you can watch season two season one banger banger

338
00:45:53,960 --> 00:46:05,160
why did you choose brad to cover i like brad you know man it's only hair because i like brad

339
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,800

00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,240

get kidnapped

424
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,240
no she walked into the arms of the enemy

425
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,240

i hate when they

431
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,240
when they make female characters

432
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,240
those forced damsels

433
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,240
in distress

434
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,240
she didn't have to go

435
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,240
she didn't have to do that

436
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,240
she didn't have to do that

437
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,240
it wasn't necessary

438
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,240
it wasn't necessary

439
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,240
hueco mundo was literally

440
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,240

441
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,240
ouch i hit my arm

442
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,240
it was preventable

443
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,240
it was

444
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,240
but they needed something

445
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,240
they needed something to get them to do things

446
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,240
i guess i guess

447
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,240
so she was the anchor

448
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,240
she was the forced anchor

449
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,240
i guess

450
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,240

451
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,240

To be there. She didn't need to go anywhere. She put herself in a situation she didn't need to be in.

482
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:47,140
I guess the only reason why they needed her to go was to give emotion to the antagonist.

483
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:57,140
The antagonist needed to gain something, a feeling or something. And the only person that can give that to him was Orohime.

484
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:03,140
I'm trying not to say too much without much spoiling.

485
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:19,140
He needed a reason. He needed something, some feelings.

486
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:23,140
Orohime was I guess the only person that can really give that to him.

487
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,140
That's what I have.

488
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:29,140
I hate when stories kind of like force.

489
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,140
Like it feels so forced.

490
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:40,140
Like who thinks that? Who goes I'm just gonna go to the enemy. I have no other choice.

491
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:49,140
And then act surprised when the characters spent like how many seasons saving people

492
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:53,140
And acting as if the person would never save you.

493
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,140
And then you wish him a goodbye.

494
00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:04,140
Goodbye. Don't worry about me. Don't come for me. I'm sorry. Goodbye.

495
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:13,140
I also like Grimjall a lot. I guess he'd be my third favorite.

496
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:16,140
Grimjall Jaggerjack. I like Grimjall.

497
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:20,140
Yeah, he'd be my third.

498
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,140
How disrespectful he was during a fight. True.

499
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:45,140
I really just like them delinquents. I don't know.

500
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:52,140
He's so cute. His little bells and his little tenet.

501
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:56,140
He won't kill a puppy. He didn't want to kill baby.

502
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:11,140
It's a new anime of Bleach. I heard it at Remake.

503
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:15,140
It's not really a remake. It's more like a new season. Like a continuation.

504
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:20,140
So yeah, it's out now. Actually, I haven't seen it yet though.

505
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,140
I haven't seen it yet.

506
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:29,140
I don't like cliffhangers when it comes to that show. So I'm waiting.

507
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:35,140
It's like a new season. How many years? Excuse me.

508
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,140
Excuse me.

509
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:43,140
Oh, my throat. Oh my gosh.

510
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:50,140
How many years? It's been a long time.

511
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:56,140
You thought Bleach ended officially? No, it did not.

512
00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:00,140
Bleach, when Bleach ended, the manga was still ongoing.

513
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:04,140
The manga never stopped. The manga kept going.

514
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,140
So it did not end.

515
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:19,140
Sadly, it's because a lot of people in the fanbase pressured the author to make more.

516
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:24,140
I think he made an interview where he said he didn't want to make more.

517
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:28,140
But he was pressured to make more.

518
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:33,140
So the manga kept going.

519
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,140
parameters

520
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,140
Yeah.

521
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,140

but i i don't like repetitive things i really don't but i really do like one piece

532
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:44,500
but the beginning one piece was really good and then i don't know what happened

533
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:51,220
it just it just started to get worse and worse as time went

534
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:04,260
i did not read the manga of jujutsu kaisen unfortunately no

535
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:13,620
i am not up to date with jujutsu kaisen either i watched the movie the movie and then i stopped there

536
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:20,100
i didn't watch the new season i'm scared i saw spoilers so i like stopped what i stopped

537
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:25,860
and i don't want to watch anything yet until my brain forgets some things i already forgot a bunch

546
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:51,780
shield hero amazing it was great i loved it it was good i loved season one season two

547
01:02:52,580 --> 01:03:04,900
was all right but the ending was rushed then season three came and it was boring it was boring

548
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:16,340
it was bad it was bad i don't like season three and i and i and i i haven't even watched it

549
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:22,100
the rest of it i don't like it i like i even try to come back to watching it again i got like

550
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:29,300
try it again three episode rule three episode rule watch three episodes and see where it takes

551
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:35,060
you i watch three episodes i'm like all right this is it season episode the fourth episode

552
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:41,780
should be something crazy right something yeah i watch episode four what is this what is happening

553
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:45,540
i'm i don't i don't

554
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:56,340
try to watch another no i can't do this i don't know what is this i don't want it i don't want it

555
01:03:57,060 --> 01:04:03,460
no i'm okay i'm not gonna watch this i'm not i'm taking this off my list uh uh trash

556
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:14,100
you gotta finish season two i forced myself to get through season two i forced myself

557
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:19,780
you want to know how you want to know how i got through season two you want to know how i got

558
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:35,220
through season two of rise and to hero so whenever i started whenever i started an episode

559
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:44,340
i would take season one's opening song play it skip the season two opening song

560
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:52,340
so

561
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:12,340
that's how that's how i got through it

562
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:14,900
so

563
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:22,500
you just couldn't do that for season three it just didn't work that way it was so boring

564
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:28,100
gaslighting yourself

565
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:36,100
so the the opening for season one was so good come on

566
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:41,060
it was so good

567
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:52,180
one piece favorite character is zoro um i'm um zoro

568
01:05:55,060 --> 01:06:05,620
i think i think that's i think that i don't think i don't think uh i guess zoro and robin robin robin robin

569
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:12,420
yeah zoro zoro my favorite one piece character ace was

570
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:18,260
white beard was

571
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:32,020
and now we have now i'm left with zoro and luffy those are my two favorite characters the main character

572
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,940
and zoro

573
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:09,220
um almost unprecedented levels of culture from i just watched too much anime

574
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:14,740
i don't leave home so i just watched too much anime

575
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:22,260
i've watched quite a lot of anime so much actually

576
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:28,180
yeah oh my gosh we've been chilling here for an hour

577
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:32,340
we're gonna be streaming for quite some time

578
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:44,260
it's already been an hour holy shit

579
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:48,660
i mean

580
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:57,540
we haven't even started playing the game i was so worried about the lag

581
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:09,540
i was so worried about the lag it was so weird

582
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:20,900
um

583
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:30,020
do i have a favorite anime or genre you can't ask me that question

584
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:38,420
i don't i don't have a i don't have a favorite anime i i have a current favorite anime

585
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:43,460
i don't have an all-time favorite anime i have a bunch of all-time favorite anime

586
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:48,260
but i can't put them on a wait on a wait and weigh them

587
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:54,100
like which is better i can't do that i've watched too many i can't do that

588
01:08:56,260 --> 01:09:03,140
least favorite anime my brain probably forgot them so i can't think of them right now

589
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:07,860
you know how when something was like really bad experience when you were watching it

590
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:13,380
so your brain blocked it out so your brain just blocks it out

591
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:19,700
not can't think of one

592
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:30,500
but i'm on my current favorite right now that is even topping slime at the moment

593
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:34,900
slime and tsukimichi because tsukimichi is also just talking at the moment

594
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:38,420
uh they they're doing the same thing as slime

595
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:44,100
he really doesn't want to fight he's like avoiding fighting by doing other things

596
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:50,260
and there's too many cliffhangers he was falling for this from the sky for two episodes

597
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:54,180
i i two episodes he was falling from the sky i don't know

598
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:01,060
and it was just going to everyone else i don't care about everyone else i want to see him fight

599
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:09,780
uh what if i want to see him murder die die die kill kill kill you know yeah yeah

600
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:19,780
so um right now my the anime i'm watching at at the moment that has like really god-tier animation

601
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:26,900
i think the animation is crazy my eyes are blessed uh seventh prince reincarnate into the seventh prince

602
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,780
um something about focus on non-magic

603
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:35,220
something about focusing on magic i could pull it up hang on

604
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:45,060
it's like right here bam right in my face as the seventh prince so i can take my time

605
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:52,020
perfecting my magical ability you know god-tier animation mcs hellcube

606
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:52,980
uh

607
01:10:55,700 --> 01:11:01,300
muskwish so adorable i like characters who are absolutely insane

608
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:07,540
i love that i love revenge i like people who don't care about other people

609
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:12,100
and people who are absolutely op for no reason

610
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:20,100
and i like seeing people scared in shock when they belittle someone because of their appearance

611
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:27,620
i like it i like it a lot like take that you thought he was just a child he thought he was just weak

612
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:31,060
he's gonna absolutely destroy you

613
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:44,980
it's good i like it a lot i i say it's a muskwatch for me

614
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:51,860
i'm also watching remonster it's good for like a like a

615
01:11:53,060 --> 01:12:00,340
you uh board kind of thing and you like just want to chill and watch something that tells a story in a little

616
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:08,580
in a in a different way so remonster is pretty good the opening was made fun of a lot

617
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:11,620
but it kind of grows on you as you keep watching

618
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:21,060
and the opening was really weird the animation of the opening is weird the opening song itself

619
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:28,260
is pretty amazing it's good the song is good but whoever made the animation for the opening

620
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:35,700
whoever made the animation is questionable it's questionable

621
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:44,500
the song is good the anime is good the opening of the animations

622
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:52,340
strange yeah remonster remonster yeah yeah yeah

623
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:00,500
it's about goblins

624
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:14,420
someone got reincarnated as a a monster i think and that's the the rest is you find out by watching it

625
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:19,220
i can't really say much or everything i'll say about the show is basically a spoiler

626
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:23,620
go watch it i am

627
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:35,540
it was always a harem anime though it was always a harem anime i guess what made people

628
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:41,380
kind of like it more is that the main the emcee doesn't doesn't freak out

629
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:50,820
like like all the original emcees when they're around a bunch of girls they freak out or they play dumb

630
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:58,820
or they're scared or they're terrified uh yada yada yada this emcee is not like that at all

631
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:07,380
he accepts everything with open arms and he's very uh logical and stuff about it

632
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:10,900
but he's like a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do

633
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:21,380
and i think that's i guess his own appeal to it so it's always been a harem even in the manga so yeah

634
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,820
so if you weren't ready for it yeah

635
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:37,300
yeah i'm not a big fan of harem either but i like the plot of the story itself of where everything leads

636
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:45,300
uh it keeps you interested um the i guess you'd call it random fanservice

637
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,940
then it's a big old fanservice

638
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:55,460
yeah the harem part of the manga was a little too much

639

652
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:55,300
but the newer voice actors lately aren't doing it for me they don't get into their role

653
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:58,900

684
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:46,660
what

685
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:51,140
i'm so sad

686
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:56,100
everything's fine niko was even a late

687
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:00,660

01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:09,860
hi you i'm catching fireflies for mommy

690
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:17,940
how cute is this like a village

691
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:22,900
look like crab shells filled with smelt right fish

692
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:25,940
it's full of fish heads

693
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:29,380
these are filled with smelt right fish

694
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:30,980
oh

695
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:37,780
it's like emotional damage uh maybe that made me really sad

696
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:43,780
hmm nothing's fighting i talked to him it's all you're there

697
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:50,420
so are you going here

698
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:53,540
hi person

699
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:59,460
there was a time where our people used to live in these runs

700
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:05,540
but due to the flooding most of us have moved to the less permanent settlement

701
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:10,820
flooding a the land has gotten brittle

702
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,940
and glenn used to be in one piece you know

703
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:21,300
but now it's just a bunch of islands that get smaller and smaller uh

704
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:26,500
is that it do you still live here sorry though

705
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:35,220
fish populations near the village are thinning so we fisher folk are making temporary shelter here

706
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:40,340
makes sense the deeper ruins have been abandoned for a while though

707
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:47,380
well i do see some kids coming in and out of those i think they actually live there

708
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:54,260
i hope those kids are safe one core it's fish too

709
01:22:56,180 --> 01:23:03,940
empty jar jar worms bros he i actually used to play with worms when i was a kid

710
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:10,740
when i was a kid i used to play with worms but well really a mattress

711
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:20,340
i used to play with worms i was the biggest tomboy when i was uh young

712
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:24,740

okay i'm sorry i apologize

727
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:48,660
most of the green moss covering our village has already lost its glow

728
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:57,700
if it wasn't for the thin strip left on the bowl boundaries of the land people could easily

729
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:06,020
fall into the ocean without light and water becomes indistinguishable here

730
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:10,020

759
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:56,020

760
01:29:56,660 --> 01:30:01,220
it doesn't matter one day the world will finally give this give up this fight

761
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:04,340

i'm going back this way as the brother was in the forest right

978
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:05,080

hey baby sister calomus alula you're okay thank goodness

980
02:02:15,480 --> 02:02:20,200
i was trapped inside this room and it was really scary but then the messiah saved me

981
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:28,440
trapped in the room yeah there was that weird stuff in the door you know the floating squares we

982

02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:22,280
the edges are glowing yellow it's a sacred feather

1009
02:06:22,280 --> 02:06:28,200

what or something like that she gave me she gave one of her feathers

1013
02:06:57,240 --> 02:07:04,440
to father before she died father used to pass this down as a heirloom although

1014
02:07:05,080 --> 02:07:11,560
it feels more fitting for you to have it all right are you sure totally sure i think that's

1015
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:18,280
what father would have wanted thank you i have a feather now you know who i'm gonna give it to

The south is a peninsula inhabited by my rams. They are all standing and for unfortunate spots. You have to move them onto the darker moths.

1102
02:16:14,180 --> 02:16:21,180
If you get stuck, ring a bell, and they'll all return to their original positions. Good luck.

1103
02:16:24,180 --> 02:16:25,180
Over here.

1104
02:16:34,180 --> 02:16:37,180
If you ring the bell, do you move, you do.

1105
02:16:54,180 --> 02:16:56,180
Ring the bell.

1106
02:16:59,180 --> 02:17:01,180
Ring the bell.

Ring the bell.

Ring the bell.

1110
02:17:18,180 --> 02:17:21,180
Wait, if I pushed them into the corner, wouldn't I get stuck?

1111
02:17:22,180 --> 02:17:24,180
Ring the bell.

1112
02:17:25,180 --> 02:17:27,180

02:17:34,180 --> 02:17:36,180
Ring the bell.

1116
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:42,180
Ring the bell.

1117
02:17:53,180 --> 02:17:55,180
I'm not smart.

1118
02:17:55,180 --> 02:17:57,180
I'm not smart.

1119
02:18:10,180 --> 02:18:12,180

I'm smart.

1124
02:18:54,180 --> 02:18:56,180
Ring the bell.

Thank you.

1126
02:19:06,180 --> 02:19:10,180
It was all thanks to you guys believing in me that I could do it.

1127
02:19:12,180 --> 02:19:14,180
Thanks everyone.

1128
02:19:16,180 --> 02:19:20,180
You've provided a great service for all of Ramkind.

1129
02:19:21,180 --> 02:19:28,180
In return, I take this fine ram little things.

1130
02:19:34,180 --> 02:19:36,180
You're heading to the city, aren't you?

1131
02:19:36,180 --> 02:19:38,180
Been there, done that.

1132
02:19:38,180 --> 02:19:40,180
Too cramped, you know?

1133
02:19:41,180 --> 02:19:43,180
True.

1134
02:19:44,180 --> 02:19:48,180
But it's not like this place, it's getting any bigger.

1135
02:19:48,180 --> 02:19:51,180
The rising waters and all.

1136
02:19:51,180 --> 02:19:54,180
Maybe the city isn't so bad after all.

1137
02:19:55,180 --> 02:19:58,180
You won't be able to take your rams with you.

1138
02:20:01,180 --> 02:20:04,180
What are you gonna do with your rams?

1139
02:20:18,180 --> 02:20:20,180
Ring the bell.

1140
02:20:26,180 --> 02:20:28,180
Ring the bell.

1141
02:20:44,180 --> 02:20:46,180
Ring the bell.

1142
02:20:49,180 --> 02:20:52,180
I think I have something I'd like to trade.

1143
02:20:52,180 --> 02:20:54,180
You'll take wool, right?

1144
02:20:54,180 --> 02:20:56,180
What can this wool get me?

1145
02:20:56,180 --> 02:20:58,180
Wool?

1146
02:20:58,180 --> 02:21:03,180
That'll get you this fine pile of...

1147
02:21:03,180 --> 02:21:05,180
I'm not sure what this is actually.

1148
02:21:05,180 --> 02:21:07,180
Some sort of fabric dye?

1149
02:21:10,180 --> 02:21:12,180
How about a Zura?

1150
02:21:15,180 --> 02:21:17,180
Should I?

1151
02:21:18,180 --> 02:21:20,180
We need fabric dye?

1152
02:21:33,180 --> 02:21:35,180
Should I?

1153
02:21:35,180 --> 02:21:37,180
Should I check if it's fabric dye?

1154
02:21:37,180 --> 02:21:39,180
Minecraft zombie.

1155
02:21:44,180 --> 02:21:46,180
It's like underwater.

1156
02:21:48,180 --> 02:21:50,180
It's like...

1157
02:21:50,180 --> 02:21:52,180

02:22:16,180 --> 02:22:18,180
It's like...

1170
02:22:32,180 --> 02:22:34,180
It's a drowned zombie.

1171
02:22:34,180 --> 02:22:36,180

I mean, eels are edible.

1240

They're definitely edible.

1241

They're about.

1242
02:28:04,160 --> 02:28:06,160
But don't they have to be made in a certain way.

1243
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:09,160
It's not just Reese's Puff. No, it is not.

1244
02:28:09,160 --> 02:28:11,160
It actually tastes very different.

1245

Wait, no.

1246
02:28:15,160 --> 02:28:17,160
It's full of snakes.

1247
02:28:19,160 --> 02:28:21,160
That's worse.

1248
02:28:29,160 --> 02:28:31,160
You're getting snakes.

1249
02:28:31,160 --> 02:28:37,160
Those aren't fish or eels.

1250
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:45,160
It's on here.

1251
02:28:49,160 --> 02:28:52,160
Water sample collecting and process.

1252
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:56,160
And progress.

1253
02:28:57,160 --> 02:28:59,160
I've been over here.

1254
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:02,160
I haven't been over here.

1255
02:29:03,160 --> 02:29:05,160
What's over here?

1256
02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:14,160
I like snakes.

1257
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:17,160
Snakes are so cute. Don't eat snakes.

1258
02:29:17,160 --> 02:29:19,160
I know people who do.

1259
02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:24,160
I can tell you a story about a snake experience.

1260
02:29:24,160 --> 02:29:32,160
My auntie used to have a big snake.

1261
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:34,160
They couldn't keep the snake anymore.

1262
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:36,160
So their neighbor.

1263
02:29:37,160 --> 02:29:39,160
We can take your snake.

1264
02:29:41,160 --> 02:29:44,160
And she gave the snake to them.

1265
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:46,160
And they've had the snake for years.

1266
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:50,160
And she gave them the snake.

1267
02:29:52,160 --> 02:29:55,160
And do you know what they do with the snake?

1268
02:29:55,160 --> 02:29:57,160
They ate it.

1269
02:29:57,160 --> 02:29:59,160
They ate the snake.

1270
02:30:00,160 --> 02:30:02,160
They ate the snake.

1271
02:30:02,160 --> 02:30:04,160
They ate it.

1272
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:06,160
They ate the snake.

1273
02:30:08,160 --> 02:30:10,160
They ate her snake.

1274
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:20,160
She was so upset.

1275
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:22,160
She was so angry.

1276
02:30:22,160 --> 02:30:24,160
She was so sad.

1277
02:30:24,160 --> 02:30:26,160
It was a really big snake.

1278
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:34,160
This is the research station.

1279
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:36,160
Hello.

1280
02:30:36,160 --> 02:30:40,160
Are you Zenhera by Dr. Silver Plant?

1281
02:30:40,160 --> 02:30:42,160
No.

1282
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:52,160
Here we are then.

1283
02:30:55,160 --> 02:30:57,160
Hello person. Welcome to the research station.

1284
02:30:57,160 --> 02:30:59,160
Hello.

1285
02:30:59,160 --> 02:31:01,160
Did Dr. Silver Plant send you?

1286
02:31:01,160 --> 02:31:02,160
No.

1287
02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:03,160
Matazura.

1288
02:31:03,160 --> 02:31:05,160
Oh, carry on then.

1289
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:12,160
Oh, not here.

1290
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:16,160
How come you're red instead of green?

1291
02:31:16,160 --> 02:31:20,160
Well, more of a purple than red.

1292
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:22,160
But your eyes and stuff are red.

1293
02:31:22,160 --> 02:31:26,160
I'm only here to pick up this week's small sample.

1294
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:29,160
I'll return to my station in the city soon.

1295
02:31:29,160 --> 02:31:31,160
I see it.

1296
02:31:32,160 --> 02:31:35,160
I am in charge of collecting the small samples.

1297
02:31:35,160 --> 02:31:37,160
Cool.

1298
02:31:49,160 --> 02:31:53,160
Phosphoric trees are now being protected under the new laws.

1299
02:31:53,160 --> 02:31:55,160
Please do not harvest them.

1300
02:31:55,160 --> 02:31:57,160
I'm not.

1301
02:31:58,160 --> 02:32:02,160
Phosphoric trees reduce the blade.

1302
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:10,160
Oh, it's the square.

1303
02:32:11,160 --> 02:32:13,160
Monitoring.

1304
02:32:13,160 --> 02:32:16,160
Monitoring.

1305
02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:18,160
Monitoring.

1306
02:32:18,160 --> 02:32:20,160
Monitoring.

1307
02:32:20,160 --> 02:32:22,160
Monitoring.

1308
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:25,160
Monitoring.

1309
02:32:25,160 --> 02:32:27,160
Monitoring.

1310
02:32:27,160 --> 02:32:29,160
Abnormality.

1311
02:32:29,160 --> 02:32:31,160
Abnormality.

1312
02:32:31,160 --> 02:32:33,160
What is that thing?

1313
02:32:33,160 --> 02:32:36,160
An anomaly.

1314
02:32:36,160 --> 02:32:38,160
An anomaly.

1315
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:40,160
Oh, anomaly.

1316
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:46,160
Can someone teach me English?

1317
02:32:46,160 --> 02:32:48,160
Because I don't know English.

1318
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:51,160
Can someone please teach me English?

1319
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:59,160
Why are words so hard?

1320
02:32:59,160 --> 02:33:03,160
Words should not be this hard.

1321
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:19,160
I am not a teacher. I can't teach you.

1322
02:33:19,160 --> 02:33:22,160
Become one so that you can't teach me.

1323
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:29,160
Well, yeah, but...

1324
02:33:31,160 --> 02:33:34,160
I used to go to speech therapy.

1325
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:38,160
Because I had a hard time saying certain words.

1326
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:42,160
And I have an issue with drawing out my sentences.

1327
02:33:45,160 --> 02:33:48,160
Even like I'm doing right now.

1328
02:33:48,160 --> 02:33:51,160
And I have a stuttering problem.

1329
02:33:51,160 --> 02:33:53,160
So I used to go to speech therapy.

1330
02:33:53,160 --> 02:33:55,160
I didn't help.

1331
02:34:00,160 --> 02:34:04,160
I saw someone mention themselves about it somewhere.

1332
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:06,160
I think it was in the comments somewhere.

1333
02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:08,160
And I relate to that.

1334
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:11,160
Because they didn't help me at all either.

1335
02:34:13,160 --> 02:34:17,160
I was in speech therapy for years.

1336
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:22,160
People...

1337
02:34:22,160 --> 02:34:25,160
Water collecting... collection project resuming.

1338
02:34:27,160 --> 02:34:29,160
Hello, living person.

1339
02:34:29,160 --> 02:34:34,160
Hello, I have collected a duplicate water sample.

1340
02:34:34,160 --> 02:34:36,160
Would you like it?

1341
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:41,160
My programming says that organic beans need water to survive.

1342
02:34:41,160 --> 02:34:43,160
So I shall offer it to you.

1343
02:34:43,160 --> 02:34:46,160
Oh sure, take it.

it's very true

1358
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:18,160
true

1359
02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:20,160
my lips are feeling quite

1360
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:22,160
well that's gone forever

1361
02:35:22,160 --> 02:35:24,160
i don't know where that went

1362
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:26,160
oh

1363
02:35:42,160 --> 02:35:44,160

1365
02:35:46,160 --> 02:35:48,160

1366
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:50,160
i heard mercy talking about

1367
02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:52,160
um

1368
02:35:52,160 --> 02:35:54,160
mercy was talking about

1369
02:35:54,160 --> 02:35:56,160
some nip nap

1370
02:35:56,160 --> 02:35:58,160

1371
02:35:58,160 --> 02:36:00,160

1372
02:36:00,160 --> 02:36:02,160
for nips

1373
02:36:06,160 --> 02:36:08,160
i want that so bad

1374
02:36:08,160 --> 02:36:10,160
she said it could work

1375
02:36:10,160 --> 02:36:12,160
for your

1376
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:14,160
for your lips

1377
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:18,160
i had crazy dry lips

1378
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:20,160
i had the cream on my lips all the time

1379
02:36:26,160 --> 02:36:28,160
for the nip naps

1380
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:36,160
it was very educational

1381
02:36:36,160 --> 02:36:38,160
very educational conversation

1382
02:36:42,160 --> 02:36:44,160
i was taking notes

1383
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:46,160
she even showed the picture

1384
02:36:46,160 --> 02:36:48,160
i took a screenshot

1385
02:36:48,160 --> 02:36:50,160
give me give me give me

1386
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:52,160
i'm gonna get this

1387
02:37:00,160 --> 02:37:02,160
i suffer from really dry skin as well

1388
02:37:02,160 --> 02:37:04,160
so

1389
02:37:06,160 --> 02:37:08,160
i understand

1390
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:10,160
but mine is a little different

1391
02:37:10,160 --> 02:37:12,160
as i have blotches

1392
02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:14,160
a special lotion

1393
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:18,160
i have a special lotion that i use

1394
02:37:22,160 --> 02:37:24,160
i dropped a cereal on the floor

1395
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:26,160
i'm gonna end up stepping on that later

1396
02:37:26,160 --> 02:37:28,160
i found that

1397
02:37:32,160 --> 02:37:34,160
i have a special lotion

1398
02:37:34,160 --> 02:37:36,160
that i use for my

1399
02:37:36,160 --> 02:37:38,160
for those spots

1400
02:37:38,160 --> 02:37:40,160
they help a lot

1401
02:37:42,160 --> 02:37:44,160
but

1402
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:48,160
if i don't use the lotion

1403
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:50,160
much

1404
02:37:50,160 --> 02:37:52,160
i end up really drying up

1405
02:37:54,160 --> 02:37:56,160
this is why i'm only allowed to take a shower

1406
02:37:56,160 --> 02:37:58,160
once every other day

1407
02:37:58,160 --> 02:38:00,160
or once every two days

1408
02:38:00,160 --> 02:38:02,160
because too much water can make me

1409
02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:04,160
start peeling like a lizard

1410
02:38:08,160 --> 02:38:10,160
i become a full on lizard

1411
02:38:10,160 --> 02:38:12,160
i become a full on lizard

1412
02:38:12,160 --> 02:38:14,160
start peeling

1413
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:24,160

1418
02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:34,160
earlier

1419
02:38:34,160 --> 02:38:36,160
in a place across the ocean

1420
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:38,160
this generator does not need to be fixed right now

1421
02:38:38,160 --> 02:38:40,160

silver instead of skin

1477
02:41:48,160 --> 02:41:50,160
it's like a bath in your own filth

1478
02:41:56,160 --> 02:41:58,160
she's gone

1531

No, it's not me. I'm not allergic to shower.

1532
02:46:27,680 --> 02:46:33,440
It's like an old friend all the way in the past when I was a kid.

1533
02:46:33,440 --> 02:46:40,960
I haven't seen them in a long time. It's been many many many years.

1534
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:44,400
I also knew someone who was allergic to the sun.

1535
02:46:44,400 --> 02:46:46,960
I knew someone who was allergic to the sun rays.

1536
02:46:46,960 --> 02:46:51,760

1552
02:48:06,040 --> 02:48:10,040
Azura had another dream. Did you see this one too?

1553
02:48:10,040 --> 02:48:12,040
Yeah.

1554
02:48:12,040 --> 02:48:16,040
I was in a big field like the one in my last dream.

1555
02:48:16,040 --> 02:48:19,040
And I saw my village.

1556
02:48:19,040 --> 02:48:22,040
But I only woke up.

1557
02:48:22,040 --> 02:48:29,040
Ah, I don't think this world has anything like that.

1558
02:48:29,040 --> 02:48:34,040
I mean, big wheat fields.

1559
02:48:34,040 --> 02:48:41,040
The only big plants I've seen here are a bunch of weird trees.

1560
02:48:41,040 --> 02:48:44,040
And these balls of moss floating in the water.

1561
02:48:44,040 --> 02:48:48,040
Wait, is moss even a plant?

1562
02:48:48,040 --> 02:48:51,040
Say, have you seen a wheat field before?

1563
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:54,040
Yes, I have.

1564
02:48:54,040 --> 02:49:01,040
A long, long time ago, I used to live in one.

1565
02:49:01,040 --> 02:49:05,040
It was massive. It was pretty.

1566
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:09,040
There's a lot of dragonflies everywhere.

1567
02:49:09,040 --> 02:49:10,040
Yes.

1568
02:49:10,040 --> 02:49:13,040
Oh, really pretty, aren't they?

1569
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:18,040
It is very pretty, especially when the sun's up.

1570
02:49:18,040 --> 02:49:24,040
The one around my village goes around for miles.

1571
02:49:24,040 --> 02:49:27,040
I have a really bad throat, so I don't know.

1572
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:30,040
Hydrating isn't always gonna help.

1573
02:49:30,040 --> 02:49:34,040
So it's okay, don't worry about it.

1574
02:49:34,040 --> 02:49:39,040
I will keep hydrating though, so don't you worry.

1575
02:49:39,040 --> 02:49:54,040
I have more water right here.

1576
02:49:54,040 --> 02:49:58,040
Plants are really tall, sometimes I can't even see through them.

1577
02:49:58,040 --> 02:50:02,040
When it's windy out, the wind can make waves in it.

1578
02:50:02,040 --> 02:50:05,040
It's like an ocean of food.

1579
02:50:05,040 --> 02:50:08,040
Oh wait, there's food in regular oceans too.

1580
02:50:08,040 --> 02:50:10,040
Like fish or crabs.

1581
02:50:10,040 --> 02:50:15,040
I've never actually been to a real ocean until now, actually.

1582
02:50:15,040 --> 02:50:17,040
I've been to the ocean.

1583
02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:19,040
Really?

1584
02:50:19,040 --> 02:50:22,040
That's really cool, Azura.

1585
02:50:22,040 --> 02:50:26,040
I've only seen the ocean on TV before.

1586
02:50:26,040 --> 02:50:31,040
I've never thought I'd get to ride on a boat through water.

1587
02:50:31,040 --> 02:50:33,040
I can't read.

1588
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:36,040
I never thought I'd get to ride a boat through one.

1589
02:50:36,040 --> 02:50:43,040
The water back home doesn't have glowy stuff like how it is here either.

1590
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:47,040
But I guess it's because the world is already so dark.

1591
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:56,040
Are you getting sleepy?

1592
02:50:56,040 --> 02:50:58,040
It's okay to fall asleep.

1593
02:50:58,040 --> 02:51:04,040
I don't mind you all resting your eyes if you find yourself falling asleep to the stream.

1594
02:51:04,040 --> 02:51:06,040
It's okay.

1595
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:19,040
Are you just waking up in the morning?

1596
02:51:20,040 --> 02:51:23,040
It's alright. Time to let the differences be.

1597
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:27,040
It's very fun.

1598
02:51:36,040 --> 02:51:39,040
You know, I used to be scared of the dark, Azura.

1599
02:51:39,040 --> 02:51:42,040
Me too! I used to be terrified of the dark!

1600
02:51:42,040 --> 02:51:48,040
I'll tell you, I had some family members who were like big old jerks.

1601
02:51:48,040 --> 02:51:50,040
Bullies, really.

1602
02:51:50,040 --> 02:51:53,040
They used to lock me in a closet when I was younger.

1603
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:59,040
They'd lock me in a closet and let me out for like 30 minutes to an hour.

1604
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:03,040
And I grew a big fear of the dark ever since then.

1605
02:52:03,040 --> 02:52:08,040
They always made fun of me for being scared of the dark as I got older.

1606
02:52:08,040 --> 02:52:12,040
But I mean, it's your fault.

1607
02:52:12,040 --> 02:52:14,040
It's literally your fault.

1608
02:52:14,040 --> 02:52:17,040
I was scared of the dark for a long, long time.

1609
02:52:17,040 --> 02:52:20,040
I'm only literally now getting used to it.

1610
02:52:20,040 --> 02:52:22,040
And I'm so old.

1611
02:52:24,040 --> 02:52:26,040
I'm so old.

1612
02:52:26,040 --> 02:52:28,040
I used to sleep with a TV on.

1613
02:52:28,040 --> 02:52:34,040
It's the only way I can sleep, either with a fan or some little night lights.

1614
02:52:34,040 --> 02:52:36,040
I have like a couple of night lights in my room.

1615
02:52:36,040 --> 02:52:42,040
I have a light that turns like rainbow-y colors, like all the colors of the rainbow.

1616
02:52:42,040 --> 02:52:47,040
And I have a couple of lights on the other side of my room, too.

1617
02:52:51,040 --> 02:52:57,040
So yeah, it's really hard for me to sleep at night, even until this day.

1618
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:07,040
I'm worried so you don't worry about it.

1619
02:53:07,040 --> 02:53:09,040
I'm worried.

1620
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:11,040
I'm fine.

1621
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:15,040
There literally is no need.

1622
02:53:15,040 --> 02:53:19,040
I don't want anyone to feel worried about me, okay?

1623
02:53:19,040 --> 02:53:21,040
Okay?

1624
02:53:21,040 --> 02:53:23,040
I'm okay.

1625
02:53:26,040 --> 02:53:30,040
It's a little hard to imagine that now.

1626
02:53:30,040 --> 02:53:33,040
After spending so much time here.

1627
02:53:34,040 --> 02:53:39,040
But not long ago, I couldn't even go to sleep without a lamp.

1628
02:53:39,040 --> 02:53:41,040
I still can't.

1629
02:53:43,040 --> 02:53:45,040
Me, too.

1630
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:53,040
Really?

1631
02:53:53,040 --> 02:53:57,040
Even though you're a god, gods have fears, too.

1632
02:53:57,040 --> 02:53:59,040
Goddesses have fears, too.

1633
02:54:03,040 --> 02:54:06,040
Yeah, I see it.

1634
02:54:06,040 --> 02:54:10,040
Oh, but it's a good thing I got over that fear.

1635
02:54:10,040 --> 02:54:14,040
Otherwise, I wouldn't last long here.

1636
02:54:14,040 --> 02:54:18,040
And again, I've been carrying around the sun.

1637
02:54:18,040 --> 02:54:20,040
That's not too bad.

1638
02:54:20,040 --> 02:54:23,040
Thanks, Nico more brave than me.

1639
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:29,040
Also, I don't feel scared at all with you guiding me.

1640
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:32,040
So, thanks for that.

1641
02:54:32,040 --> 02:54:34,040
He's so cute.

1642
02:54:34,040 --> 02:54:36,040
Oh my god.

1643
02:54:36,040 --> 02:54:39,040
Oh my god, did you see a little cat smiley there?

1644
02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:41,040
So cute.

1645
02:54:54,040 --> 02:54:58,040
Anyway, maybe we should head out now, Zara.

1646
02:54:58,040 --> 02:55:04,040
How big fear gods have, gods and goddesses definitely have?

1647
02:55:06,040 --> 02:55:10,040
The fear of loneliness, the fear of being alone.

1648
02:55:12,040 --> 02:55:16,040
You live basically forever.

1649
02:55:17,040 --> 02:55:25,040
And then, all of a sudden, everyone around you is gone.

1650
02:55:29,040 --> 02:55:33,040
It's lonely. It's very lonely.

1651
02:55:49,040 --> 02:55:52,040
And that's why I have you guys.

1652
02:55:52,040 --> 02:55:55,040
We will quail each other's loneliness.

1653
02:55:58,040 --> 02:56:02,040
Yeah, yeah.

1654
02:56:28,040 --> 02:56:31,040
All right.

1655
02:56:52,040 --> 02:56:54,040
It's like a fear.

1656
02:56:54,040 --> 02:56:56,040
Everyone's big fear.

1657
02:56:56,040 --> 02:57:09,040
And that's why it's easier for a god or a goddess to understand how that one emotion feels to a full extent.

1658
02:57:18,040 --> 02:57:20,040
You're not alone. I can relate.

1659
02:57:20,040 --> 02:57:24,040
Being the only one left after struggling for so long

1660
02:57:25,040 --> 02:57:33,040
Is I'm just a lonely soul. Relatable. I understand how you feel.

1661
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:40,040
Watch your lore. I away hold forever. Never let go. Never let go.

1662
02:57:40,040 --> 02:57:44,040
How sweet. I appreciate that.

1663
02:57:45,040 --> 02:57:55,040
I found a pen. Sort of. Good. Please write your name here.

1664
02:58:01,040 --> 02:58:02,040
Good luck.

1665
02:58:03,040 --> 02:58:13,040
I like the little jingle. It's cute. It's very cute. Cute jingle.

1666
02:58:13,040 --> 02:58:18,040
Is there anything else I'm supposed to do here? I feel like I'm forgetting something.

1667
02:58:32,040 --> 02:58:34,040
What in the world?

1668
02:58:56,040 --> 02:58:58,040
It's squares.

1669
02:59:02,040 --> 02:59:17,040
It's medication time. I have to take my medication real fast.

1670
02:59:17,040 --> 02:59:19,040
We're in a new location.

1671
02:59:19,040 --> 02:59:32,040
I want to finish the game.

1672
02:59:32,040 --> 02:59:42,040
In another hour, I'll take them.

1673
02:59:42,040 --> 02:59:46,040
I'll take them. I'll take the medication.

1674
02:59:46,040 --> 02:59:48,040
In another hour.

1675
02:59:50,040 --> 02:59:55,040
If I take them now, it'll put me to sleep. I don't want to go to sleep.

1676
02:59:55,040 --> 02:59:59,040
I'm fixating now.

1677
02:59:59,040 --> 03:00:01,040
In another hour, I'll take them.

1678
03:00:07,040 --> 03:00:10,040
Want us to remind you? Sure. You can do that.

1679
03:00:10,040 --> 03:00:12,040
I'd appreciate that.

1680
03:00:16,040 --> 03:00:20,040
The sun. Hello, Messiah. Welcome to the refuge.

1681
03:00:20,040 --> 03:00:24,040
Do you understand what you must do here?

1682
03:00:24,040 --> 03:00:27,040
I'm supposed to go inside the tower, right?

1683
03:00:27,040 --> 03:00:34,040
I already see the tower, so I guess we must be close to the entrance on the surface.

1684
03:00:34,040 --> 03:00:37,040
The surface? Look down, small one.

1685
03:00:37,040 --> 03:00:39,040
Oh, we're pretty high up.

1686
03:00:39,040 --> 03:00:43,040
I guess I gotta get down a lot of stairs.

1687
03:00:43,040 --> 03:00:45,040
I'll find an elevator. Correct.

1688
03:00:45,040 --> 03:00:48,040
However, the tower is a sacred place.

1689
03:00:48,040 --> 03:00:53,040
Finding the entrance may be easy, but that alone will not be enough.

1690
03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:55,040
What do you mean?

1691
03:00:55,040 --> 03:01:02,040
Once you reach the surface, I recommend visiting the library for leads.

1692
03:01:02,040 --> 03:01:04,040
Alright, thank you.

1693
03:01:04,040 --> 03:01:06,040
Off you go then.

1694
03:01:06,040 --> 03:01:09,040
I'm afraid this area is off limits for you.

1695
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:18,040
Only the bearer of the sacred kernel is permitted to access the garden.

1696
03:01:21,040 --> 03:01:24,040
Sacred kernel? Have a kernel.

1697
03:01:30,040 --> 03:01:34,040
Oh, like kernel corn? Have this.

1698
03:01:34,040 --> 03:01:38,040
It was left behind by the plant lady in the glen.

1699
03:01:39,040 --> 03:01:41,040
This is indeed the kernel.

1700
03:01:41,040 --> 03:01:44,040
Then it is your duty to regrow her.

1701
03:01:44,040 --> 03:01:46,040
Do you understand what you must do?

1702
03:01:46,040 --> 03:01:49,040
Um, yep, good.

1703
03:01:49,040 --> 03:01:53,040
We may now pass through to access the garden.

1704
03:01:53,040 --> 03:01:55,040
Weee!

1705
03:02:10,040 --> 03:02:15,040
I'm about to see it in the planter.

1706
03:02:15,040 --> 03:02:21,040
There's no dirt in this pot. Will the seed really grow like this?

1707
03:02:25,040 --> 03:02:27,040
Do I need dirt?

1708
03:02:32,040 --> 03:02:34,040
I gotta get dirt.

1709
03:02:40,040 --> 03:02:43,040
It's the shape of the light bulb.

1710
03:02:46,040 --> 03:02:48,040
We gotta get dirt.

1711
03:02:48,040 --> 03:03:17,040
I agree. I also, I am, being alone has its ups and downs, whether it is the quiet.

1712
03:03:17,040 --> 03:03:19,040
I really like my solitude.

1713
03:03:19,040 --> 03:03:21,040
I really do.

1714
03:03:29,040 --> 03:03:33,040
That didn't scare me. I wasn't scared once.

1715
03:03:33,040 --> 03:03:35,040
That didn't scare me at all.

1716
03:03:35,040 --> 03:03:38,040
Come on!

1717
03:03:38,040 --> 03:03:41,040
Come on!

1718
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:43,040
Work already!

1719
03:03:43,040 --> 03:03:45,040
What was that?

1720
03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:47,040
I really do like my solitude.

1721
03:03:47,040 --> 03:03:50,040
I like spending time to myself sometimes.

1722
03:03:50,040 --> 03:04:00,040
But you really do hate when it's like really, really, really quiet.

1723
03:04:00,040 --> 03:04:05,040
You miss the noise that surrounds it and stuff.

1724
03:04:07,040 --> 03:04:10,040
I don't hate it when I'm like with someone.

1725
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:23,040
It's more like when being talked to when you're like enjoying your solitude.

1726
03:04:23,040 --> 03:04:28,040
You know, like when you're like watching anime and someone starts talking to you.

1727
03:04:28,040 --> 03:04:31,040
Doesn't that not bother you?

1728
03:04:31,040 --> 03:04:34,040
Come on! Come on!

1729
03:04:34,040 --> 03:04:36,040
I'm too busy for this.

1730
03:04:36,040 --> 03:04:38,040
Excuse me?

1731
03:04:38,040 --> 03:04:42,040
Whoa, you are you?

1732
03:04:42,040 --> 03:04:47,040
Oh jeez, I didn't think I was gonna run into.

1733
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:49,040
This is embarrassing.

1734
03:04:49,040 --> 03:04:53,040
Er, is there anything I can help you with?

1735
03:04:53,040 --> 03:04:55,040
Yes please.

1736
03:04:55,040 --> 03:04:58,040
I would like to know how to get to the surface.

1737
03:04:58,040 --> 03:05:02,040
Yeah, I was afraid you were gonna say that.

1738
03:05:02,040 --> 03:05:06,040
Right now, this elevator is the only way to access the surface.

1739
03:05:06,040 --> 03:05:11,040
But yeah, just take a look at it.

1740
03:05:11,040 --> 03:05:14,040
It looks like an elevator.

1741
03:05:14,040 --> 03:05:22,040
Oh, you're not wrong, but go look at the button panel.

1742
03:05:22,040 --> 03:05:23,040
Huh?

1743
03:05:23,040 --> 03:05:25,040
There aren't any buttons.

1744
03:05:25,040 --> 03:05:29,040
Yup, that's a problem.

1745
03:05:29,040 --> 03:05:36,040
There's really a big button here that says ground on it.

1746
03:05:36,040 --> 03:05:39,040
You know, cause it takes you to the ground area.

1747
03:05:39,040 --> 03:05:42,040
Now it's been ripped out or something.

1748
03:05:42,040 --> 03:05:46,040
I tried looking everywhere for it to no avail.

1749
03:05:46,040 --> 03:05:49,040
Maybe it exploded?

1750
03:05:49,040 --> 03:05:52,040
Do you think we'll have to make a new one?

1751
03:05:52,040 --> 03:05:53,040
What?

1752
03:05:53,040 --> 03:05:54,040
How?

1753
03:05:54,040 --> 03:05:57,040
We'll figure it out.

1754
03:05:57,040 --> 03:06:00,040
Do you think we'll be able to make that button?

1755
03:06:00,040 --> 03:06:02,040
Well, no pressure kid.

1756
03:06:02,040 --> 03:06:05,040
I'll just stick with my original plan for now.

1757
03:06:05,040 --> 03:06:10,040
Time to kick the door again.

1758
03:06:10,040 --> 03:06:15,040
My foot hurts.

1759
03:06:15,040 --> 03:06:17,040
Silly Billy.

1760
03:06:17,040 --> 03:06:18,040
Okay.

1761
03:06:18,040 --> 03:06:20,040
They always say go left.

1762
03:06:20,040 --> 03:06:22,040
Oh.

1763
03:06:22,040 --> 03:06:27,040
Well, that's nothing there.

1764
03:06:27,040 --> 03:06:30,040
What's the bed?

1765
03:06:30,040 --> 03:06:37,040
We don't need that yet.

1766
03:06:37,040 --> 03:06:39,040
Oh, there's squares.

1767
03:06:39,040 --> 03:06:50,040
There's squares again.

1768
03:06:50,040 --> 03:06:53,040
You think you can clear the last two areas tonight?

1769
03:06:53,040 --> 03:06:54,040
Yeah.

1770
03:06:54,040 --> 03:06:56,040
We're gonna play for a while tonight.

1771
03:06:56,040 --> 03:06:58,040
I'm feeling up to it.

1772
03:06:58,040 --> 03:07:04,040
You know?

1773
03:07:04,040 --> 03:07:06,040
It is a Friday.

1774
03:07:06,040 --> 03:07:09,040
So I wanna enjoy a Friday night.

1775
03:07:09,040 --> 03:07:24,040
Being a noiseless house disturbs me.

1776
03:07:24,040 --> 03:07:26,040
But I can't stand loud noises.

1777
03:07:26,040 --> 03:07:27,040
Me too.

1778
03:07:27,040 --> 03:07:31,040
Actually, I agree.

1779
03:07:31,040 --> 03:07:32,040
Have fun learning.

1780
03:07:32,040 --> 03:07:34,040
Last time for me to go to sleep.

1781
03:07:34,040 --> 03:07:36,040
I'll have a good night.

1782
03:07:36,040 --> 03:07:38,040
Sweet dreams.

1783
03:07:38,040 --> 03:07:40,040
Good night.

1784
03:07:40,040 --> 03:07:52,040
Night night.

1785
03:07:52,040 --> 03:07:55,040
Wow.

1786
03:07:55,040 --> 03:07:57,040
This tells me go that way.

1787
03:07:57,040 --> 03:08:00,040
This says go down.

1788
03:08:00,040 --> 03:08:07,040
Sweet squares.

1789
03:08:07,040 --> 03:08:10,520
laboratories  Meghan

1790
03:08:37,040 --> 03:08:40,040
because the ground access elevator is broken

1791
03:08:40,360 --> 03:08:41,760
so I've been told

1792
03:08:42,280 --> 03:08:46,640
the city's infrastructure has been suffering a lot lately

1793
03:08:47,280 --> 03:08:50,560
skywalks and stairs breaking off left and right

1794
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:55,040
now the only reliable way of transport of those elevators

1795
03:08:55,160 --> 03:08:57,120
until now anyway

1796
03:08:58,720 --> 03:09:00,040
milk and sugar

1797
03:09:00,040 --> 03:09:01,040
I like both

1798
03:09:01,040 --> 03:09:02,040
me too

1799
03:09:02,040 --> 03:09:03,640
but not in coffee

1800
03:09:04,640 --> 03:09:07,640
I like it in coffee

1801
03:09:09,640 --> 03:09:10,640
a lot of it

1802
03:09:10,640 --> 03:09:12,640
add a lot of it in coffee

1803
03:09:13,640 --> 03:09:14,640
coffee machine

1804
03:09:14,640 --> 03:09:15,640
nearly full

1805
03:09:19,640 --> 03:09:22,640
you know that's all guy came in here earlier

1806
03:09:22,640 --> 03:09:23,640
same the same thing

1807
03:09:24,640 --> 03:09:26,640
he asked me if I've seen a button that says ground on it

1808
03:09:27,640 --> 03:09:29,640
looked pretty stressed

1809
03:09:29,640 --> 03:09:31,640
so I wanted to cheer him up

1810
03:09:31,640 --> 03:09:33,640
until I'm not only ground

1811
03:09:33,640 --> 03:09:36,640
I've seen today's coffee grounds

1812
03:09:52,640 --> 03:09:54,640
I thought she was angry

1813
03:09:54,640 --> 03:09:56,640
I would be too

1814
03:09:58,640 --> 03:09:59,640
he didn't get it

1815
03:10:02,640 --> 03:10:03,640
shh

1816
03:10:06,640 --> 03:10:08,640
I see him around a lot

1817
03:10:08,640 --> 03:10:11,640
but never seems to have time to get a proper meal

1818
03:10:12,640 --> 03:10:14,640
he kind of just rushes in here

1819
03:10:14,640 --> 03:10:16,640
drinks a whole pot of coffee

1820
03:10:16,640 --> 03:10:18,640
and then rushes by out

1821
03:10:18,640 --> 03:10:19,640
yeah

1822
03:10:19,640 --> 03:10:20,640
he really like

1823
03:10:20,640 --> 03:10:23,640
he really takes his job to the extreme

1824
03:10:24,640 --> 03:10:26,640
I mean it's an important job

1825
03:10:26,640 --> 03:10:28,640
but nothing is worth

1826
03:10:28,640 --> 03:10:30,640
that amount of stress I think

1827
03:10:30,640 --> 03:10:32,640
what does he do?

1828
03:10:32,640 --> 03:10:34,640
maintenance I believe

1829
03:10:34,640 --> 03:10:36,640
something to do with the lights

1830
03:10:36,640 --> 03:10:38,640
but I don't know the details

1831
03:10:38,640 --> 03:10:40,640
maybe he can ask me later

1832
03:10:40,640 --> 03:10:41,640
oh

1833
03:10:41,640 --> 03:10:42,640
you're still here

1834
03:10:42,640 --> 03:10:43,640
would you

1835
03:10:45,640 --> 03:10:46,640
like something?

1836
03:10:46,640 --> 03:10:47,640
anything?

1837
03:10:47,640 --> 03:10:49,640
I can cook something for you if you want

1838
03:10:49,640 --> 03:10:51,640
sorry thank you

1839
03:10:53,640 --> 03:10:55,640
I am right here

1840
03:11:01,640 --> 03:11:04,640
okay so I can't go anywhere in there

1841
03:11:09,640 --> 03:11:11,640
was there like an area I missed or something?

1842
03:11:11,640 --> 03:11:12,640
over here

1843
03:11:22,640 --> 03:11:24,640
I'm like probably

1844
03:11:27,640 --> 03:11:28,640
good evening

1845
03:11:29,640 --> 03:11:30,640
well

1846
03:11:30,640 --> 03:11:32,640
the time of day doesn't really mean anything now

1847
03:11:33,640 --> 03:11:35,640
when the sun's gone

1848
03:11:35,640 --> 03:11:37,640
with the sun gone

1849
03:11:37,640 --> 03:11:39,640
the night never seems to end

1850
03:11:40,640 --> 03:11:42,640
well then

1851
03:11:42,640 --> 03:11:43,640
how can you tell?

1852
03:11:43,640 --> 03:11:44,640
time

1853
03:11:44,640 --> 03:11:45,640
I mean

1854
03:11:45,640 --> 03:11:47,640
I have my ways

1855
03:11:47,640 --> 03:11:50,640
because she's a giant walking clock

1856
03:11:51,640 --> 03:11:54,640
there they are a giant walking clock

1857
03:11:55,640 --> 03:11:57,640
there they are

1858
03:11:57,640 --> 03:11:59,640
time is precious

1859
03:11:59,640 --> 03:12:01,640
please cherish it

1860
03:12:01,640 --> 03:12:03,640
I will

1861
03:12:07,640 --> 03:12:09,640
they are just

1862
03:12:09,640 --> 03:12:11,640
bolted so people

1863
03:12:11,640 --> 03:12:14,640
they just bolted so people won't steal them

1864
03:12:14,640 --> 03:12:17,640
they're just bolted so people won't steal them

1865
03:12:17,640 --> 03:12:19,640
feel free to use them

1866
03:12:20,640 --> 03:12:22,640
a tape dispenser

1867
03:12:23,640 --> 03:12:26,640
it's bolted to the table

1868
03:12:26,640 --> 03:12:29,640
oh my god I can't say the word bolted

1869
03:12:30,640 --> 03:12:32,640
why is it so hard?

1870
03:12:36,640 --> 03:12:38,640
a stapler

1871
03:12:40,640 --> 03:12:42,640
some kind of computer terminal

1872
03:12:43,640 --> 03:12:46,640
I am the power room mechanic

1873
03:12:46,640 --> 03:12:48,640
do you have an issue to report?

1874
03:12:48,640 --> 03:12:50,640
yeah actually

1875
03:12:50,640 --> 03:12:52,640
surface axis elevator appears to be broken

1876
03:12:52,640 --> 03:12:54,640
there's a button missing then

1877
03:12:54,640 --> 03:12:56,640
can you take a look?

1878
03:12:56,640 --> 03:12:59,640
leaving this room is not in my programming

1879
03:12:59,640 --> 03:13:01,640
I don't know

1880
03:13:10,640 --> 03:13:12,640
nah I don't like the music change

1881
03:13:12,640 --> 03:13:14,640
all of this button

1882
03:13:14,640 --> 03:13:16,640
I don't like this

1883
03:13:17,640 --> 03:13:19,640
computer

1884
03:13:22,640 --> 03:13:25,640
you're gonna need this soon

1885
03:13:25,640 --> 03:13:27,640
take this phone

1886
03:13:27,640 --> 03:13:29,640
and expose it to the void

1887
03:13:29,640 --> 03:13:32,640
the answer will be revealed when you bring it back again

1888
03:13:33,640 --> 03:13:36,640
the computer printed out a strange transparent sheet

1889
03:13:42,640 --> 03:13:44,640
still clueless

1890
03:13:44,640 --> 03:13:46,640
pick yours

1891
03:13:58,640 --> 03:14:01,640
where have my sense of humor gone?

1892
03:14:01,640 --> 03:14:04,640
why is that so funny to me?

1893
03:14:15,640 --> 03:14:18,640
did I make a weird film?

1894
03:14:23,640 --> 03:14:25,640
why is this happening?

1895
03:14:25,640 --> 03:14:27,640
because I'm hearing the goddess right now

1896
03:14:36,640 --> 03:14:39,640
it shouldn't be so funny but it is

1897
03:14:40,640 --> 03:14:42,640
a heavy piece of metal

1898
03:14:42,640 --> 03:14:44,640
sat into the wall

1899
03:14:44,640 --> 03:14:47,640
I think it might be a door or some kind of a

1900
03:14:47,640 --> 03:14:49,640
small screen here though

1901
03:15:01,640 --> 03:15:03,640
hello

1902
03:15:10,640 --> 03:15:12,640
wow

1903
03:15:13,640 --> 03:15:16,640
I've actually never been to the big city before

1904
03:15:16,640 --> 03:15:18,640
all these lights

1905
03:15:19,640 --> 03:15:21,640
all these people

1906
03:15:22,640 --> 03:15:26,640
I guess most of this world's population live here

1907
03:15:40,640 --> 03:15:43,640
I'm sorry it's the way he turns a look at me

1908
03:15:52,640 --> 03:15:55,640
it's very different from my village

1909
03:15:55,640 --> 03:15:57,640
the village is very small

1910
03:15:57,640 --> 03:15:59,640
surrounded by huge fields

1911
03:15:59,640 --> 03:16:01,640
saw a bit of it

1912
03:16:01,640 --> 03:16:04,640
in one of my dreams from a while ago

1913
03:16:04,640 --> 03:16:06,640
the tallest building in the world

1914
03:16:07,640 --> 03:16:10,640
the tallest buildings in our village

1915
03:16:10,640 --> 03:16:13,640
are only two stories tall

1916
03:16:24,640 --> 03:16:26,640
what about you Zara?

1917
03:16:26,640 --> 03:16:28,640
what do you love?

1918
03:16:32,640 --> 03:16:34,640
a city

1919
03:16:34,640 --> 03:16:36,640
a city like this?

1920
03:16:36,640 --> 03:16:38,640
wow

1921
03:16:38,640 --> 03:16:41,640
kind of mad and living in a city

1922
03:16:43,640 --> 03:16:45,640
must be exciting

1923
03:16:47,640 --> 03:16:49,640
get me out

1924
03:16:49,640 --> 03:16:51,640
get me out

1925
03:16:51,640 --> 03:16:53,640
get me out

1926
03:16:57,640 --> 03:16:59,640
get me out

1927
03:16:59,640 --> 03:17:02,640
you wanna be here no more

1928
03:17:02,640 --> 03:17:04,640
get me out

1929
03:17:04,640 --> 03:17:06,640
help me

1930
03:17:06,640 --> 03:17:08,640
help me

1931
03:17:20,640 --> 03:17:22,640
kind of scary

1932
03:17:27,640 --> 03:17:29,640
the view is nice though

1933
03:17:33,640 --> 03:17:35,640
I'm so tired

1934
03:17:54,640 --> 03:17:56,640
wait

1935
03:17:56,640 --> 03:17:58,640
wait

1936
03:18:02,640 --> 03:18:04,640
wait

1937
03:18:10,640 --> 03:18:12,640
is this a circle?

1938
03:18:12,640 --> 03:18:14,640
did I walk in a circle?

1939
03:18:15,640 --> 03:18:17,640
did I walk in a circle?

1940
03:18:26,640 --> 03:18:29,640
was this just a giant circle?

1941
03:18:30,640 --> 03:18:33,640
I'm so confused

1942
03:18:48,640 --> 03:18:50,640
was it a circle?

1943
03:18:52,640 --> 03:18:54,640
I don't understand

1944
03:18:54,640 --> 03:18:56,640
now let me go back up

1945
03:18:56,640 --> 03:18:58,640
let me go

1946
03:18:59,640 --> 03:19:01,640
let me go

1947
03:19:01,640 --> 03:19:03,640
let me go

1948
03:19:03,640 --> 03:19:07,640
I was just a big massive circle

1949
03:19:07,640 --> 03:19:10,640
you don't need to be in here

1950
03:19:11,640 --> 03:19:14,640
the thingy gave me something

1951
03:19:14,640 --> 03:19:17,640
it's a lot I'm gonna need it later

1952
03:19:20,640 --> 03:19:22,640
let it give me

1953
03:19:29,640 --> 03:19:31,640
let it give me

1954
03:19:54,640 --> 03:19:57,640
I'm looking at my files right now

1955
03:19:57,640 --> 03:19:59,640
looking in there

1956
03:19:59,640 --> 03:20:01,640
let's see what it is

1957
03:20:01,640 --> 03:20:03,640
blinded

1958
03:20:03,640 --> 03:20:05,640
flashbang

1959
03:20:11,640 --> 03:20:13,640
let me see

1960
03:20:14,640 --> 03:20:16,640
what are you giving me

1961
03:20:16,640 --> 03:20:18,640
what is it giving me

1962
03:20:18,640 --> 03:20:20,640
tell the hero take this

1963
03:20:20,640 --> 03:20:23,640
oh it gave me the paper

1964
03:20:23,640 --> 03:20:25,640
the transparent paper

1965
03:20:27,640 --> 03:20:29,640
the paper

1966
03:20:29,640 --> 03:20:31,640
I forgot

1967
03:20:31,640 --> 03:20:33,640
sorry

1968
03:20:33,640 --> 03:20:35,640
slow

1969
03:20:41,640 --> 03:20:45,640
how do I take the thingy off the desk

1970
03:20:57,640 --> 03:20:59,640
what is this

1971
03:21:01,640 --> 03:21:03,640
we didn't even do it this

1972
03:21:27,640 --> 03:21:29,640
I'm so confused

1973
03:21:35,640 --> 03:21:37,640
I'm so confused

1974
03:21:39,640 --> 03:21:41,640
is there something film related?

1975
03:21:43,640 --> 03:21:45,640
it's a lot of numbers

1976
03:21:49,640 --> 03:21:51,640
what about with this

1977
03:21:53,640 --> 03:21:55,640
a new journal

1978
03:21:57,640 --> 03:21:59,640
I don't know

1979
03:22:05,640 --> 03:22:07,640
there's nothing in there

1980
03:22:13,640 --> 03:22:15,640
I think over here was the last

1981
03:22:27,640 --> 03:22:29,640
it's locked

1982
03:22:33,640 --> 03:22:35,640
it's locked

1983
03:22:35,640 --> 03:22:37,640
it's locked

1984
03:22:41,640 --> 03:22:43,640
landscape painting

1985
03:22:45,640 --> 03:22:47,640
an abstract painting

1986
03:22:49,640 --> 03:22:51,640
are you an intruder?

1987
03:22:51,640 --> 03:22:53,640
because if you are

1988
03:22:53,640 --> 03:22:55,640
I model 8

1989
03:22:55,640 --> 03:22:57,640
home security bot

1990
03:22:57,640 --> 03:22:59,640
tm serial number

1991
03:22:59,640 --> 03:23:01,640
39232883904

1992
03:23:03,640 --> 03:23:05,640
will have to report you

1993
03:23:05,640 --> 03:23:07,640
oh sorry

1994
03:23:07,640 --> 03:23:09,640
I cannot just walk in because the door was unlocked

1995
03:23:09,640 --> 03:23:11,640
do you want me to leave

1996
03:23:11,640 --> 03:23:13,640
scanning for suspicious activity

1997
03:23:13,640 --> 03:23:15,640
suspicious activity

1998
03:23:15,640 --> 03:23:17,640
suspicious activity

1999
03:23:17,640 --> 03:23:19,640
why I stuttered so hard

2000
03:23:19,640 --> 03:23:21,640
suspicious activity detected zero

2001
03:23:21,640 --> 03:23:23,640
guess as long as I don't do anything bad

2002
03:23:25,640 --> 03:23:27,640
it's off

2003
03:23:31,640 --> 03:23:33,640

2004
03:23:33,640 --> 03:23:35,640

2006
03:23:39,640 --> 03:23:41,640
looks comfy

2007
03:23:49,640 --> 03:23:51,640

2008
03:23:51,640 --> 03:23:53,640

big penguin plush

2016
03:24:23,640 --> 03:24:25,640
I

2017
03:24:27,640 --> 03:24:29,640

2018
03:24:29,640 --> 03:24:31,640

03:25:23,640 --> 03:25:25,640
I

2029
03:25:31,640 --> 03:25:33,640

03:25:33,640 --> 03:25:35,640

2033
03:25:39,640 --> 03:25:41,640
it's a pink flower

2034
03:25:47,640 --> 03:25:49,640
pink flower

2035
03:25:49,640 --> 03:25:51,640
so

2036
03:25:51,640 --> 03:25:53,640
these houses are so empty

2037
03:25:53,640 --> 03:25:55,640
so depressing

2038
03:25:55,640 --> 03:25:57,640
it's like nothing else in there

2039
03:26:01,640 --> 03:26:03,640
pictures of many ones and zero

2040
03:26:03,640 --> 03:26:05,640
finding a four robot

2041
03:26:05,640 --> 03:26:07,640
playing cards

2042
03:26:07,640 --> 03:26:09,640

do you know rock paper scissors

2046
03:26:15,640 --> 03:26:17,640
it's a higher difficulty level

2047
03:26:17,640 --> 03:26:19,640
hmm

2048
03:26:19,640 --> 03:26:21,640

don't mind

2051
03:26:27,640 --> 03:26:29,640
my parents are like

2052
03:26:29,640 --> 03:26:31,640
literally never home

2053
03:26:31,640 --> 03:26:33,640
and

2054
03:26:33,640 --> 03:26:35,640
my parents are like

2055
03:26:35,640 --> 03:26:37,640
literally never home

2056
03:26:37,640 --> 03:26:39,640
but I don't mind

2057
03:26:39,640 --> 03:26:41,640
I'm used to it

2058
03:26:41,640 --> 03:26:43,640
besides

2059
03:26:43,640 --> 03:26:45,640
I've got models cw2

2060
03:26:45,640 --> 03:26:47,640
2nd gen

2061
03:26:47,640 --> 03:26:49,640
unit 4e here

2062
03:26:49,640 --> 03:26:51,640
to keep me company now

2063
03:26:51,640 --> 03:26:53,640
she still talks a little weird sometimes

2064
03:26:53,640 --> 03:26:55,640
but that's okay

2065
03:26:55,640 --> 03:26:57,640
she's learning

2066
03:26:57,640 --> 03:26:59,640
if I work real hard

2067
03:26:59,640 --> 03:27:01,640
she might even be tamed someday

2068
03:27:03,640 --> 03:27:05,640
I keep hearing that word

2069
03:27:05,640 --> 03:27:07,640
what tamed

2070
03:27:09,640 --> 03:27:11,640
nobody's told me what it means

2071
03:27:11,640 --> 03:27:13,640
yeah

2072
03:27:13,640 --> 03:27:15,640
that's just a robot thing

2073
03:27:15,640 --> 03:27:17,640
oh I didn't even read it

2074
03:27:17,640 --> 03:27:19,640
I can't really

2075
03:27:19,640 --> 03:27:21,640
something

2076
03:27:23,640 --> 03:27:25,640
nope

2077
03:27:25,640 --> 03:27:27,640
nope

2078
03:27:27,640 --> 03:27:29,640
nope

2079
03:27:29,640 --> 03:27:31,640
nope

2080
03:27:31,640 --> 03:27:33,640
can't really explain it either

2081
03:27:33,640 --> 03:27:35,640
while of large books

2082
03:27:35,640 --> 03:27:37,640
one of them is a robot instruction manual

2083
03:27:37,640 --> 03:27:39,640
it's off

2084
03:27:41,640 --> 03:27:43,640
right right here

2085
03:27:43,640 --> 03:27:45,640
there

2086
03:27:45,640 --> 03:27:47,640
there

2087
03:27:47,640 --> 03:27:49,640
another one

2088
03:27:51,640 --> 03:27:53,640
picture of a ram

2089
03:27:53,640 --> 03:27:55,640
wearing a little pink bow

2090
03:27:55,640 --> 03:27:57,640
it's a landscape portrait of the glen

2091
03:28:01,640 --> 03:28:03,640
something has been chewing on this plant

2092
03:28:03,640 --> 03:28:05,640
it's the ram

2093
03:28:05,640 --> 03:28:07,640
ram

2094
03:28:07,640 --> 03:28:09,640
ram

2095
03:28:09,640 --> 03:28:11,640
ram

2096
03:28:11,640 --> 03:28:13,640
ram

2097
03:28:13,640 --> 03:28:15,640
ram

2098
03:28:15,640 --> 03:28:17,640
more books

2099
03:28:17,640 --> 03:28:19,640
this city life

2100
03:28:19,640 --> 03:28:21,640
what to expect

2101
03:28:21,640 --> 03:28:23,640
I just moved here from the glen

2102
03:28:23,640 --> 03:28:25,640
it's so different in the city

2103
03:28:25,640 --> 03:28:27,640
you went to the glen right?

2104
03:28:27,640 --> 03:28:29,640
yeah

2105
03:28:29,640 --> 03:28:31,640
everything's so green back there

2106
03:28:31,640 --> 03:28:33,640
I really miss it

2107
03:28:33,640 --> 03:28:35,640
I already gave me some plants to cheer me up

2108
03:28:35,640 --> 03:28:37,640
but

2109
03:28:37,640 --> 03:28:39,640
I should probably get a muzzle

2110
03:28:39,640 --> 03:28:41,640
for bestie here

2111
03:28:41,640 --> 03:28:43,640
bestie

2112
03:28:47,640 --> 03:28:49,640
how much of this plant

2113
03:28:49,640 --> 03:28:51,640
nope

2114
03:28:51,640 --> 03:28:53,640
just repeat

2115
03:28:53,640 --> 03:28:55,640
usually they always have a second dialogue

2116
03:28:55,640 --> 03:28:57,640
but sometimes they don't

2117
03:28:57,640 --> 03:28:59,640
I like to check just in case

2118
03:28:59,640 --> 03:29:01,640
hehe

2119
03:29:01,640 --> 03:29:03,640

hehe

2122
03:29:09,640 --> 03:29:11,640
can I sit on it?

2123
03:29:11,640 --> 03:29:13,640
I'm not sure what this is

2124
03:29:13,640 --> 03:29:15,640
it's like a little car

2125
03:29:15,640 --> 03:29:17,640
you should write on it

2126
03:29:19,640 --> 03:29:21,640
what?

2127
03:29:21,640 --> 03:29:23,640
do it

2128
03:29:23,640 --> 03:29:25,640
home

2129
03:29:25,640 --> 03:29:27,640

i don't know excuses from me what do you mean

2158
03:31:36,680 --> 03:31:40,680
there was a word missing from that

2159
03:31:40,680 --> 03:31:48,680
i'm like a copium

03:31:48,680 --> 03:31:54,680
no copium here i don't even know that means

We got these growing lambs.

2167
03:32:44,680 --> 03:32:48,680
But they are a poor substitute for the sun.

2168
03:32:54,680 --> 03:32:56,680
This tree has leaves.

2169
03:32:56,680 --> 03:32:58,680
Ah yes, true.

2170
03:32:58,680 --> 03:33:02,680
Bully is just hard to come by nowadays.

2171
03:33:02,680 --> 03:33:08,680
You hardly ever see trees like these in the wild anymore.

2172
03:33:08,680 --> 03:33:16,680
And the ones you do see are pretty much all raised artificially by people like me.

2173
03:33:16,680 --> 03:33:20,680
Mostly for nostalgia purposes.

2174
03:33:26,680 --> 03:33:28,680
It's sweet.

2175
03:33:30,680 --> 03:33:32,680
Why is it in a flower pot?

2176
03:33:32,680 --> 03:33:35,680
Well, doesn't it look nice?

2177
03:33:35,680 --> 03:33:37,680
I guess.

2178
03:33:39,680 --> 03:33:43,680
I like to stand in the middle of the wheat fields back in my village.

2179
03:33:43,680 --> 03:33:45,680
It goes on for miles.

2180
03:33:45,680 --> 03:33:48,680
Ah, I wish I could have seen it.

2181
03:33:48,680 --> 03:33:54,680
In our world, meat is usually only grown in small isolated pots.

2182
03:33:54,680 --> 03:33:57,680
Or in a flower pot.

2183
03:33:59,680 --> 03:34:01,680
There's a phosphor tree.

2184
03:34:01,680 --> 03:34:05,680
Oh, like the ones we saw in the Glen.

2185
03:34:06,680 --> 03:34:08,680
Where are the leaves?

2186
03:34:08,680 --> 03:34:10,680
They're not dead, are they?

2187
03:34:10,680 --> 03:34:12,680
Oh, not at all.

2188
03:34:12,680 --> 03:34:19,680
Although these trees are common, composed of woody tissue, they are closer to grass.

2189
03:34:19,680 --> 03:34:22,680
Anonymy-wise.

2190
03:34:22,680 --> 03:34:25,680
So the branches are actually leaves?

2191
03:34:25,680 --> 03:34:27,680
Sort of.

2192
03:34:27,680 --> 03:34:33,680
What is interesting about these plants is the amount of phosphorus they generate.

2193
03:34:33,680 --> 03:34:35,680
Zero before dinner?

2194
03:34:35,680 --> 03:34:36,680
Yeah.

2195
03:34:36,680 --> 03:34:38,680
I'm an adult!

2196
03:34:56,680 --> 03:34:57,680
Phosphor.

2197
03:34:57,680 --> 03:34:59,680
That's the glowy stuff, right?

2198
03:34:59,680 --> 03:35:00,680
Yup.

2199
03:35:00,680 --> 03:35:05,680
Phosphor can store light energy and slowly emit it over time.

2200
03:35:10,680 --> 03:35:16,680
Most of the phosphorus from this world still contains energy from before the sun went out.

2201
03:35:16,680 --> 03:35:18,680
Without the sun to recharge them though.

2202
03:35:18,680 --> 03:35:21,680
Well, let's talk about something else.

2203
03:35:31,680 --> 03:35:32,680
Hmm.

2204
03:35:35,680 --> 03:35:38,680
A water again is half full.

2205
03:35:41,680 --> 03:35:44,680

2219
03:37:47,340 --> 03:37:49,340
They could have saved it.

2220
03:37:49,340 --> 03:37:52,340
They didn't have to make so many back to back to back.

2221
03:38:00,340 --> 03:38:02,340
Couldn't get into black over.

2222
03:38:04,340 --> 03:38:07,340
The power system was a bit weird to understand.

2223
03:38:07,340 --> 03:38:12,340
They eventually explained it to you in better detail further into the anime.

2224
03:38:12,340 --> 03:38:21,340
But it's meant to confuse you because even to the regular like even to the emcee it was confusing.

2225
03:38:21,340 --> 03:38:27,340
So it was like meant to kind of confuse you like what's going on.

2226
03:38:27,340 --> 03:38:35,340
Like this is dumb whatever this hierarchy stuff is dumb and it makes you agree with the emcee.

2227
03:38:36,340 --> 03:38:39,340
So yeah, it was silly.

2228
03:38:40,340 --> 03:38:44,340
But then they eventually explain it properly over time.

2229
03:38:45,340 --> 03:38:51,340
Probably don't only plant hard enough to survive naturally outside the glenn.

2230
03:38:53,340 --> 03:39:00,340
Personally, I think they're really born look at one of my customers really loves them though.

2231
03:39:01,340 --> 03:39:05,340
I think all of the black clovers I'm growing here are for him actually.

2232
03:39:05,340 --> 03:39:07,340
And I think of it.

2233
03:39:07,340 --> 03:39:09,340
Haven't seen him in a while.

2234
03:39:09,340 --> 03:39:11,340
Wonder when he's coming back.

2235
03:39:12,340 --> 03:39:15,340
Coming to pick the mom these up.

2236
03:39:18,340 --> 03:39:20,340
Hmm, it's a pink flower.

2237
03:39:22,340 --> 03:39:24,340
Smoke garden tool.

2238
03:39:24,340 --> 03:39:28,340
And the part shaped like an owl.

2239
03:39:28,340 --> 03:39:30,340
I get it.

2240
03:39:36,340 --> 03:39:38,340
I don't get it.

2241
03:39:46,340 --> 03:39:48,340
I don't get it.

2242
03:39:48,340 --> 03:39:50,340
I don't get it.

2243
03:39:50,340 --> 03:39:52,340
I don't get it.

2244
03:39:57,340 --> 03:39:59,340
A hoe?

2245
03:39:59,340 --> 03:40:01,340
Is it because it's like a hoe?

2246
03:40:01,340 --> 03:40:03,340
So it's like who who?

2247
03:40:03,340 --> 03:40:05,340
A hoe?

2248
03:40:05,340 --> 03:40:07,340
No, but it's not a hoe.

2249
03:40:09,340 --> 03:40:11,340
That's not what you call it.

2250
03:40:13,340 --> 03:40:15,340
Garden tool.

2251
03:40:16,340 --> 03:40:18,340
Trowel.

2252
03:40:39,340 --> 03:40:41,340
I knew that.

2253
03:40:41,340 --> 03:40:43,340
I knew that.

2254
03:40:44,340 --> 03:40:46,340
I knew that.

2255
03:40:48,340 --> 03:40:49,340
Hello there.

2256
03:40:49,340 --> 03:40:51,340
You have a lot of plants.

2257
03:40:51,340 --> 03:40:52,340
A dune.

2258
03:40:52,340 --> 03:40:54,340
All of these myself you see.

2259
03:40:57,340 --> 03:40:59,340
Feel free to ask.

2260
03:40:59,340 --> 03:41:01,340
Oh, you're a gardener right?

2261
03:41:01,340 --> 03:41:05,340
Do you have any dirt for growing plants I mean?

2262
03:41:05,340 --> 03:41:07,340
Yup, do you need some?

2263
03:41:07,340 --> 03:41:08,340
Yes.

2264
03:41:08,340 --> 03:41:12,340
I'm supposed to plant the seeds I find while I plant later.

2265
03:41:13,340 --> 03:41:16,340
The pod in the garden doesn't have any soil.

2266
03:41:16,340 --> 03:41:17,340
I see.

2267
03:41:17,340 --> 03:41:19,340
I know what you're talking about.

2268
03:41:19,340 --> 03:41:22,340
Here, take this whole bag.

2269
03:41:22,340 --> 03:41:24,340
Thanks Mr. Plant person.

2270
03:41:24,340 --> 03:41:26,340
I like your little bowl.

2271
03:41:26,340 --> 03:41:29,340
Little bowl around your neck.

2272
03:41:29,340 --> 03:41:32,340
Most of the plants in our world tend to grow in the plant.

2273
03:41:32,340 --> 03:41:36,340
Even if it's facing the flooding issue.

2274
03:41:36,340 --> 03:41:41,340
It's still in better condition than the other two areas.

2275
03:41:41,340 --> 03:41:45,340
The barrens is, well, the barrens.

2276
03:41:45,340 --> 03:41:50,340
And Refuge City has barely enough ground to stand on.

2277
03:41:50,340 --> 03:41:52,340
Let alone grow still.

2278
03:41:52,340 --> 03:41:56,340
On a larger scale like this, I mean.

2279
03:41:56,340 --> 03:41:57,340
Is that it?

2280
03:41:57,340 --> 03:41:59,340
Good luck with the seed now.

2281
03:41:59,340 --> 03:42:01,340
Thank you, bye bye.

2282
03:42:01,340 --> 03:42:15,340
Our stairs here.

2283
03:42:15,340 --> 03:42:17,340
Coffee cups.

2284
03:42:17,340 --> 03:42:19,340
I'm too young to drink coffee.

2285
03:42:19,340 --> 03:42:21,340
Eh?

2286
03:42:21,340 --> 03:42:22,340
The coffee machine.

2287
03:42:22,340 --> 03:42:24,340
It's very warm.

2288
03:42:24,340 --> 03:42:26,340
Are you really?

2289
03:42:26,340 --> 03:42:27,340
What's the library?

2290
03:42:27,340 --> 03:42:28,340
I love books.

2291
03:42:28,340 --> 03:42:30,340
It looks like fun books.

2292
03:42:34,340 --> 03:42:36,340
Dog ear?

2293
03:42:36,340 --> 03:42:38,340
Dog ear.

2294
03:42:38,340 --> 03:42:41,340
Yeah, I was just testing you.

2295
03:42:41,340 --> 03:42:43,340
Just testing you guys.

2296
03:42:43,340 --> 03:42:45,340
We're bleeding hearts.

2297
03:42:45,340 --> 03:42:47,340
I was just testing you.

2298
03:42:47,340 --> 03:42:49,340
Hey there.

2299
03:42:49,340 --> 03:42:51,340
Hello.

2300
03:42:51,340 --> 03:42:53,340
You the Messiah?

2301
03:42:53,340 --> 03:42:56,340
I like your scarf.

2302
03:42:56,340 --> 03:42:58,340
Thank you.

2303
03:42:58,340 --> 03:43:00,340
Mama made it for me.

2304
03:43:00,340 --> 03:43:02,340
Tell her I like her needlework.

2305
03:43:02,340 --> 03:43:03,340
I will.

2306
03:43:03,340 --> 03:43:05,340
When I see her again.

2307
03:43:05,340 --> 03:43:06,340
Well.

2308
03:43:12,340 --> 03:43:14,340
Okay.

2309
03:43:14,340 --> 03:43:16,340
It's a kitchen.

2310
03:43:16,340 --> 03:43:18,340
Oh, it's a fridge.

2311
03:43:20,340 --> 03:43:22,340
A sink.

2312
03:43:22,340 --> 03:43:24,340
A trash can.

2313
03:43:24,340 --> 03:43:26,340
There's just magnets on it.

2314
03:43:26,340 --> 03:43:28,340
Maybe they'll come in handy.

2315
03:43:28,340 --> 03:43:31,340
I hope nobody will mind us taking them.

2316
03:43:31,340 --> 03:43:34,340
I have magnets now.

2317
03:43:34,340 --> 03:43:36,340
What's over here?

2318
03:43:36,340 --> 03:43:38,340
The door.

2319
03:43:38,340 --> 03:43:40,340
Trash can.

2320
03:43:42,340 --> 03:43:44,340
Is that it?

2321
03:43:44,340 --> 03:43:46,340
Your books?

2322
03:43:46,340 --> 03:43:48,340
Who knows that?

2323
03:43:48,340 --> 03:43:49,340
I think it's in here.

2324
03:43:49,340 --> 03:43:53,340
Looks like I can un-latch this door.

2325
03:43:53,340 --> 03:43:55,340
Nice.

2326
03:43:55,340 --> 03:43:57,340
Nothing is locked right here.

2327
03:43:59,340 --> 03:44:01,340
There's dirt now.

2328
03:44:20,340 --> 03:44:22,340
How old is Nico?

2329
03:44:22,340 --> 03:44:23,340
About a kitten.

2330
03:44:23,340 --> 03:44:25,340
Nico's a kitten.

2331
03:44:25,340 --> 03:44:27,340
Nico's quite young.

2332
03:44:27,340 --> 03:44:28,340
And cute.

2333
03:44:28,340 --> 03:44:30,340
Hello again, Messiah.

2334
03:44:30,340 --> 03:44:32,340
Do you need help?

2335
03:44:32,340 --> 03:44:33,340
No.

2336
03:44:33,340 --> 03:44:35,340
Off you go then.

2337
03:44:35,340 --> 03:44:36,340
Off you go.

2338
03:44:36,340 --> 03:44:38,340
I'm going.

2339
03:44:38,340 --> 03:44:41,340
Nico's a baby.

2340
03:44:41,340 --> 03:44:44,340
Nico's a cute little baby.

2341
03:44:48,340 --> 03:44:51,340
I hope this helps you grow a little seed.

2342
03:44:52,340 --> 03:44:56,340
Seeds in the soil, but it looks a bit dry.

2343
03:44:59,340 --> 03:45:01,340
Good thinking, Sarah.

2344
03:45:01,340 --> 03:45:04,340
Oh, there should help this seed grow.

2345
03:45:05,340 --> 03:45:06,340
Hmm.

2346
03:45:06,340 --> 03:45:09,340
The dirt's nice and moist now, but...

2347
03:45:09,340 --> 03:45:11,340
What if it dries out?

2348
03:45:11,340 --> 03:45:14,340
There's only so much water in this little tube.

2349
03:45:14,340 --> 03:45:16,340
I'll hold onto the tube for now.

2350
03:45:16,340 --> 03:45:18,340
Just in case.

2351
03:45:19,340 --> 03:45:22,340
I'll be giving it dirt and water.

2352
03:45:22,340 --> 03:45:24,340
But will that be enough?

2353
03:45:24,340 --> 03:45:26,340
I can't wait.

2354
03:45:26,340 --> 03:45:28,340
I'm coming to you.

2355
03:45:46,340 --> 03:45:48,340
I'm losing so much time.

2356
03:45:48,340 --> 03:45:50,340
I probably have 42 minutes of work already.

2357
03:45:50,340 --> 03:45:52,340
I hate this.

And I saw water up here.

2382
03:47:06,340 --> 03:47:09,340
Can I, like, take water from there?

2383
03:47:19,340 --> 03:47:23,340
Or is it not gonna ask me for it yet?

2384
03:47:33,340 --> 03:47:36,340
Am I missing something?

2385
03:47:38,340 --> 03:47:42,340
I think I'm missing some sort of information.

2386
03:47:43,340 --> 03:47:47,340
I don't know what I'm missing, though.

2387
03:47:48,340 --> 03:47:51,340
I think I'm missing something.

2388
03:48:01,340 --> 03:48:05,340
I had my fan blowing in my direction this whole time.

2389
03:48:06,340 --> 03:48:09,340
I really hope it wasn't loud.

2390
03:48:12,340 --> 03:48:15,340
Was it, like, super loud?

2391
03:48:16,340 --> 03:48:21,340
I, like, just noticed the fan blowing in this direction.

2392
03:48:24,340 --> 03:48:26,340
No?

2393
03:48:28,340 --> 03:48:30,340
No? No?

2394
03:48:31,340 --> 03:48:33,340
Does anyone hear it?

2395
03:48:33,340 --> 03:48:36,340
I turned it down just in case.

2396
03:48:46,340 --> 03:48:51,340
I get stuck in games like this a lot. Me, too.

2397
03:48:51,340 --> 03:48:55,340
Did you find the computer in the area?

2398
03:48:55,340 --> 03:48:58,340
Oh, yeah, that's right! I forgot all about that.

2399
03:48:58,340 --> 03:49:01,340
Yeah, I found that. They gave me a film.

2400
03:49:06,340 --> 03:49:10,340
I heard nothing. The fan I was talking about was you, obviously, silly.

2401
03:49:10,340 --> 03:49:14,340
Oh, yeah, I have to get this. This thing.

2402
03:49:15,340 --> 03:49:18,340
It's bolted to the table.

2403
03:49:24,340 --> 03:49:27,340
How do I get it off the table?

2404
03:49:45,340 --> 03:49:48,340
I think I'm missing something.

2405
03:49:48,340 --> 03:49:51,340
I don't know what I'm missing.

2406
03:49:51,340 --> 03:49:54,340
I don't know what I'm missing.

2407
03:49:54,340 --> 03:49:57,340
I don't know what I'm missing.

2408
03:49:57,340 --> 03:50:00,340
I don't know what I'm missing.

2409
03:50:00,340 --> 03:50:03,340
I don't know what I'm missing.

2410
03:50:03,340 --> 03:50:06,340
I don't know what I'm missing.

2411
03:50:06,340 --> 03:50:09,340
I don't know what I'm missing.

2412
03:50:09,340 --> 03:50:12,340
I don't know what I'm missing.

2413
03:50:13,340 --> 03:50:16,340
I got this. I can figure it out.

2414
03:50:16,340 --> 03:50:19,340
I'm smart. I'm smart.

2415
03:50:19,340 --> 03:50:22,340
I got this. I'll figure it out.

2416
03:50:22,340 --> 03:50:25,340
I'll figure it out.

2417
03:50:25,340 --> 03:50:28,340
We'll grab a hand first, and we'll see.

2418
03:50:28,340 --> 03:50:31,340
Still clueless.

2419
03:50:31,340 --> 03:50:34,340
Yeah! Yeah!

2420
03:50:34,340 --> 03:50:37,340
Yeah, clueless.

2421
03:50:37,340 --> 03:50:40,340
Yeah, clueless.

2422
03:50:40,340 --> 03:50:43,340
Yeah, clueless.

2423
03:50:43,340 --> 03:50:46,340
I'm so real clueless.

2424
03:50:46,340 --> 03:50:49,340
We'll see.

2425
03:50:49,340 --> 03:50:52,340
Thank you.

2426
03:50:52,340 --> 03:50:54,340
I mean, figures.

2427
03:50:54,340 --> 03:50:57,340
We have to do it like that.

2428
03:50:57,340 --> 03:51:00,340
Well, no, Jim, yes.

2429
03:51:00,340 --> 03:51:04,340
There is void beyond the four walls.

2430
03:51:04,340 --> 03:51:08,340
The binder world to yours.

2431
03:51:08,340 --> 03:51:12,340
The edges of your viewport.

2432
03:51:12,340 --> 03:51:16,340
Where everything is obscure.

2433
03:51:16,340 --> 03:51:19,340
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

2434
03:51:25,340 --> 03:51:29,340
Pass the film through the void, and back again.

2435
03:51:30,340 --> 03:51:33,340
I don't know.

2436
03:51:33,340 --> 03:51:36,340
I don't know.

2437
03:51:36,340 --> 03:51:39,340
I don't know.

2438
03:51:39,340 --> 03:51:42,340
I don't know.

2439
03:51:42,340 --> 03:51:45,340
The screen?

2440
03:51:45,340 --> 03:51:48,340
Oh, the screen?

2441
03:51:48,340 --> 03:51:51,340
I remember this part. It's so funny.

2442
03:51:51,340 --> 03:51:54,340
Oh, sorry.

2443
03:51:54,340 --> 03:51:57,340
Okay.

2444
03:51:58,340 --> 03:52:01,340
I...

2445
03:52:01,340 --> 03:52:04,340
I...

2446
03:52:04,340 --> 03:52:07,340
What am I doing with this?

2447
03:52:10,340 --> 03:52:14,340
Pass it through the void.

2448
03:52:14,340 --> 03:52:17,340
And then back again.

2449
03:52:20,340 --> 03:52:26,340
How do you pass this through the void?

2450
03:52:27,340 --> 03:52:30,340
Back again.

2451
03:52:30,340 --> 03:52:33,340
Through the void.

2452
03:52:33,340 --> 03:52:36,340
Back again.

2453
03:52:44,340 --> 03:52:47,340
What?

2454
03:52:47,340 --> 03:52:51,340
I don't get it.

2455
03:52:51,340 --> 03:52:55,340
It's windowed currently, yeah?

2456
03:53:05,340 --> 03:53:09,340
Oh!

2457
03:53:09,340 --> 03:53:13,340
Oh!

2458
03:53:13,340 --> 03:53:16,340
Oh!

2459
03:53:26,340 --> 03:53:30,340
I feel that I'm still an accident.

2460
03:53:31,340 --> 03:53:34,340
That's what they mean by the void.

2461
03:53:34,340 --> 03:53:37,340
That's so stupid.

2462
03:53:37,340 --> 03:53:40,340
That's so stupid.

2463
03:53:40,340 --> 03:53:43,340
I can't believe I forgot.

2464
03:53:43,340 --> 03:53:47,340
I don't remember any of this.

2465
03:53:47,340 --> 03:53:51,340
I played this game so long ago.

2466
03:53:51,340 --> 03:53:54,340
Memory lane.

2467
03:53:54,340 --> 03:53:57,340
That's so dull.

2468
03:53:57,340 --> 03:54:01,340
I'm not going to tell a single soul what I did.

2469
03:54:01,340 --> 03:54:05,340
When one day you play the game yourself,

2470
03:54:05,340 --> 03:54:08,340
when one day you play the game yourself,

2471
03:54:08,340 --> 03:54:12,340
it'll be stuck like me.

2472
03:54:12,340 --> 03:54:15,340
It'll be stuck like me.

2473
03:54:15,340 --> 03:54:18,340
It'll be stuck like me.

2474
03:54:18,340 --> 03:54:21,340
It'll be stuck like me.

2475
03:54:21,340 --> 03:54:24,340
It'll be stuck like me.

2476
03:54:24,340 --> 03:54:27,340
Like me.

2477
03:54:35,340 --> 03:54:38,340
It'll get stuck.

2478
03:54:38,340 --> 03:54:41,340
It'll get stuck.

2479
03:54:41,340 --> 03:54:44,340
It'll get stuck.

2480
03:54:49,340 --> 03:54:52,340
Let me see.

2481
03:54:52,340 --> 03:54:55,340
Where do you put the code?

2482
03:54:55,340 --> 03:54:58,340
Was it up here?

2483
03:54:58,340 --> 03:55:01,340
Was it up here?

2484
03:55:01,340 --> 03:55:04,340
I don't know.

2485
03:55:04,340 --> 03:55:07,340
What was the code for?

2486
03:55:07,340 --> 03:55:10,340
Was it a code again? Do you guys remember?

2487
03:55:10,340 --> 03:55:13,340
Do you guys remember the code?

2488
03:55:13,340 --> 03:55:17,340
I need you guys to help me remember the code.

2489
03:55:18,340 --> 03:55:21,340
My little bleeding hearts help me.

2490
03:55:32,340 --> 03:55:34,340
Hi, Zara.

2491
03:55:34,340 --> 03:55:37,340
Start to watch your videos and make me happy and comfy.

2492
03:55:37,340 --> 03:55:40,340
I hope you do it.

2493
03:55:40,340 --> 03:55:43,340
Do it well in the future.

2494
03:55:43,340 --> 03:55:46,340
Thank you. Appreciate you for stopping by.

2495
03:55:46,340 --> 03:55:49,340
I'm glad you find my videos nice and cozy.

2496
03:55:49,340 --> 03:55:52,340
I hope you will continue to find them nice and cozy.

2497
03:55:52,340 --> 03:55:55,340
Thank you.

2498
03:56:04,340 --> 03:56:07,340
Look at it again.

2499
03:56:11,340 --> 03:56:14,340
63014

2500
03:56:14,340 --> 03:56:17,340
63014

2501
03:56:22,340 --> 03:56:25,340
Stabler.

2502
03:56:28,340 --> 03:56:31,340
Do I need a stabler?

2503
03:56:44,340 --> 03:56:47,340
I'm so confused. What now?

2504
03:56:59,340 --> 03:57:02,340
What now?

2505
03:57:02,340 --> 03:57:05,340
Uh oh, I'm yelling.

2506
03:57:05,340 --> 03:57:08,340
Was there a place that needed a lock?

2507
03:57:08,340 --> 03:57:11,340
That had a lock on it?

2508
03:57:29,340 --> 03:57:32,340
Do you guys remember a place like that?

2509
03:57:32,340 --> 03:57:35,340
But a lock on it?

2510
03:57:38,340 --> 03:57:41,340
That needed a passcode or something?

2511
03:57:48,340 --> 03:57:51,340
Don't be afraid to ask if you are hungry.

2512
03:57:51,340 --> 03:57:54,340
I want to make you something.

2513
03:57:58,340 --> 03:58:01,340
I don't remember seeing anything that a lock on it.

2514
03:58:02,340 --> 03:58:05,340
I don't know.

2515
03:58:23,340 --> 03:58:26,340
This is the bed, right?

2516
03:58:26,340 --> 03:58:29,340
Yeah.

2517
03:58:29,340 --> 03:58:32,340
I don't need bed right now.

2518
03:58:32,340 --> 03:58:35,340
I'm in bed.

2519
03:58:59,340 --> 03:59:02,340
A game like this?

2520
03:59:02,340 --> 03:59:05,340
I hate how I'm going to use my head,

2521
03:59:05,340 --> 03:59:08,340
but it's so satisfying to be.

2522
03:59:08,340 --> 03:59:11,340
Yeah, I agree.

2523
03:59:11,340 --> 03:59:14,340
I also hate using my head.

2524
03:59:20,340 --> 03:59:23,340

No, it's not that.

2586
04:05:35,460 --> 04:05:37,460
It's terrifying.

2587
04:05:50,460 --> 04:05:52,460
A true gamer.

2588
04:05:53,460 --> 04:05:55,460
Okay.

2589
04:05:58,460 --> 04:06:00,460
Does she, like, do anything?

2590
04:06:00,460 --> 04:06:02,460
Can I give her something?

2591
04:06:02,460 --> 04:06:03,460
Is she gonna...

2592
04:06:03,460 --> 04:06:05,460
Does she like something?

2593
04:06:05,460 --> 04:06:06,460
Like...

2594
04:06:07,460 --> 04:06:09,460
What does she want?

2595
04:06:11,460 --> 04:06:12,460
Hello.

2596
04:06:13,460 --> 04:06:14,460
Hello.

2597
04:06:16,460 --> 04:06:17,460
Uh-huh.

2598
04:06:23,460 --> 04:06:26,460
How do you go ahead and rock it to red people's rooms, yeah?

2599
04:06:32,460 --> 04:06:34,460
I'm still monitoring you.

2600
04:06:34,460 --> 04:06:36,460
Alert level has been set to low.

2601
04:06:36,460 --> 04:06:37,460
Don't worry.

2602
04:06:37,460 --> 04:06:39,460
Bronze will be a good cast.

2603
04:06:49,460 --> 04:06:50,460
But...

2604
04:06:51,460 --> 04:06:53,460
But what am I supposed to do here?

2605
04:06:59,460 --> 04:07:01,460
Where can I stick the magnets onto?

2606
04:07:03,460 --> 04:07:05,460
And what do I do with the codes?

2607
04:07:21,460 --> 04:07:23,460
Like, what am I missing?

2608
04:07:30,460 --> 04:07:32,460
I just got back from dinner.

2609
04:07:32,460 --> 04:07:34,460
I hope what did you eat yet?

2610
04:07:50,460 --> 04:07:52,460
I took my meds, don't worry.

2611
04:07:55,460 --> 04:07:58,460
You guys reminded me.

2612
04:07:59,460 --> 04:08:01,460
Taco burger is what?

2613
04:08:03,460 --> 04:08:04,460
That sounds amazing.

2614
04:08:06,460 --> 04:08:08,460
I really need to find a way to get to the library.

2615
04:08:09,460 --> 04:08:10,460
On the surface.

2616
04:08:10,460 --> 04:08:12,460
Or the library on the surface.

2617
04:08:20,460 --> 04:08:21,460
Oh, what?

2618
04:08:21,460 --> 04:08:23,460
How do you get it to fit?

2619
04:08:51,460 --> 04:08:53,460
This man said something about magnets.

2620
04:08:53,460 --> 04:08:57,460
But I don't see a way of these fitting into the panel by themselves.

2621
04:08:59,460 --> 04:09:02,460
The only thing that I can think of is the tape.

2622
04:09:03,460 --> 04:09:06,460
But I walked up to the tape.

2623
04:09:06,460 --> 04:09:08,460
I clicked on the tape.

2624
04:09:09,460 --> 04:09:11,460
But nothing happened.

2625
04:09:12,460 --> 04:09:13,460
I'll take this one there.

2626
04:09:13,460 --> 04:09:14,460
I'll take this one there.

2627
04:09:14,460 --> 04:09:16,460
Yeah, see you.

2628
04:09:21,460 --> 04:09:30,460
And the only hint I have is this table.

2629
04:09:30,460 --> 04:09:32,460
I mean this tape.

2630
04:09:33,460 --> 04:09:36,460
Like, what do you do with this tape?

2631
04:09:36,460 --> 04:09:38,460
What do you do with this tape?

2632
04:09:42,460 --> 04:09:44,460
Feel free to use though.

2633
04:09:45,460 --> 04:09:47,460
Can I, like, take some?

2634
04:09:48,460 --> 04:09:50,460
Give me tape.

2635
04:09:51,460 --> 04:09:53,460
There's no way to use this tape.

2636
04:09:54,460 --> 04:09:55,460
I don't know.

2637
04:09:56,460 --> 04:09:57,460
I don't know.

2638
04:09:57,460 --> 04:09:58,460
I don't know.

04:09:58,460 --> 04:09:59,460

04:10:02,460 --> 04:10:03,460
I don't know.

2643
04:10:03,460 --> 04:10:04,460
I don't know.

2644
04:10:05,460 --> 04:10:07,460
There's no way to take it off.

2645
04:10:08,460 --> 04:10:09,460
Right?

2646
04:10:24,460 --> 04:10:25,460
Need a hand?

2647
04:10:25,460 --> 04:10:26,460
Yeah, I need a hand.

2648
04:10:26,460 --> 04:10:28,460
Give me a hand, please.

2649
04:10:28,460 --> 04:10:30,460
Please help.

2650
04:10:30,460 --> 04:10:32,460
Help, help.

2651
04:10:33,460 --> 04:10:35,460

Please, please.

2653
04:10:38,460 --> 04:10:40,460
Give me a little hand.

2654
04:10:55,460 --> 04:10:57,460
I'm missing an item.

2655
04:10:57,460 --> 04:10:59,460
Look at that.

2656
04:10:59,460 --> 04:11:01,460
Is it not the tape?

2657
04:11:03,460 --> 04:11:05,460
How do I get this item?

2658
04:11:11,460 --> 04:11:13,460
There's something to do with the codes.

2659
04:11:14,460 --> 04:11:15,460
Right?

2660
04:11:21,460 --> 04:11:23,460
There's something to do with the codes.

I need scissors.

2682
04:13:24,180 --> 04:13:26,180
Is the scissors in one of the rooms?

2683
04:13:26,180 --> 04:13:28,180
I want to have the bed.

One of the bedrooms?

2685
04:13:34,180 --> 04:13:36,180
The scissors.

2686
04:13:37,180 --> 04:13:39,180
One of the bedrooms.

04:13:41,180 --> 04:13:42,180

I don't have scissors in the air.

2691
04:14:03,180 --> 04:14:05,180
Does she can lend me?

2692
04:14:05,180 --> 04:14:07,180

Want this feather?

There's an empty tube. No, you can't have that.

2706
04:15:14,180 --> 04:15:16,180
You have such a long dialogue.

2708
04:15:22,180 --> 04:15:24,180
Where are the scissors?

2709

The scissors in the air.

2710
04:15:40,180 --> 04:15:42,180
I wasn't here.

2711
04:15:42,180 --> 04:15:44,180
There was nothing you can hear.

Do they want a feather?

where i'd like watch like

2932
04:39:47,260 --> 04:39:49,100
what do you call them ticky talkies

2933
04:39:51,740 --> 04:39:53,340
so how do you call them ticky talkies

2934
04:39:55,980 --> 04:40:00,540
ticky talkies

2935
04:40:09,660 --> 04:40:15,980
rest to get better mama oh well oh well don't worry we're having a good time here

2936
04:40:16,940 --> 04:40:17,660
where are they at

2937
04:40:21,260 --> 04:40:26,780
how many medications have you been on in your long life as a goddess

2938
04:40:29,100 --> 04:40:34,780
well i mean so they found this mass in my nose they told me it wasn't the c word

2939
04:40:34,860 --> 04:40:48,940
i said it wasn't that um which is thank goodness but um i had this

2940
04:40:50,140 --> 04:40:57,660
thing in my nose for a long time for about seven years and my doctors kept telling me i was fine

2941
04:40:58,220 --> 04:41:02,140
it's nothing to worry about all you're fine oh it's probably just a headache

2942
04:41:02,220 --> 04:41:07,420
i was probably just stressed i was probably just this probably just that like there's nothing

2943
04:41:07,420 --> 04:41:14,300
wrong with you you're fine so for seven whole years seven the nine years they kept dismissing me

2944
04:41:14,300 --> 04:41:29,980
sending me home so uh yeah um i one day i was working i was working at a job and i got hit with

2945
04:41:32,220 --> 04:41:38,220
like this is after they were already trying to fire me because i had a doctor's appointment

2946
04:41:38,220 --> 04:41:42,780
every week i had to see a therapist every week because i had just got out of the hospital

2947
04:41:44,300 --> 04:41:52,380
i just i got out of the hospital so i had to see a doctor every week and um it was mandatory and uh

2948
04:41:52,460 --> 04:42:03,740
uh uh um in order to get my medication i had to see the therapist therapist wouldn't prescribe

2949
04:42:03,740 --> 04:42:09,740
me anything unless i talked to them directly so it was mandatory that i went to these doctors

2950
04:42:09,740 --> 04:42:17,020
appointments and it was mandatory that i went to see my therapist i'm on and my psychiatrist

2951
04:42:17,020 --> 04:42:23,580
however um my the place i was working at did not like this even though i told them

2952
04:42:24,380 --> 04:42:31,580
before they hired me i set it on my application that i cannot work on this day which is

2953
04:42:32,380 --> 04:42:43,020
what would be old monday monday monday mondays i'm i'm i'm i cannot uh do anything on mondays

2954
04:42:43,020 --> 04:42:48,540
and tuesdays because i added tuesday because i have other doctors appointments that

2955
04:42:49,660 --> 04:42:56,140
layer on top of monday doctor appointments so now it's monday and tuesdays where you most likely

2956
04:42:56,140 --> 04:43:05,020
won't see me which is why i don't stream on mondays and tuesdays last week or this week was a exception

2957
04:43:05,020 --> 04:43:13,020
so yeah

2958
04:43:15,980 --> 04:43:25,660
it took them my job did not like the fact that i worked those days uh that i had to

2959
04:43:25,660 --> 04:43:33,100
go to my doctor's appointments those days so they uh they let me go and then they asked me

2960
04:43:33,100 --> 04:43:43,580
if i wanted to continue um if i wanted to continue working the next few days with them

2961
04:43:43,580 --> 04:43:54,700
and i said yeah and lo and behold at two days before my last day i got sick like it wasn't

2962
04:43:54,780 --> 04:43:58,300
like a normal sick

2963
04:44:11,500 --> 04:44:17,180
it wasn't like a normal sick i got a headache was i um

all right my throat is fine i'm fine

2966
04:44:32,060 --> 04:44:36,140
i think i just need to take pain pain meds real fast uh the other ones

2967
04:44:38,860 --> 04:44:41,820
these i take only when i'm feeling a certain pain

2968
04:44:47,820 --> 04:44:53,020
i think these i'll be fine i'll be okay all right don't worry don't worry don't worry

2969
04:44:57,980 --> 04:45:05,260
wow i got like an excruciating headache while i was working um this job

2970
04:45:06,140 --> 04:45:09,020
and it wouldn't go away i had taken um

2971
04:45:17,900 --> 04:45:29,980
i had taken some like painkillers for the headache and the headache didn't go away

2972
04:45:29,980 --> 04:45:36,940
i was so confused and it just persisted and got worse and worse and worse i'm like this is

2973
04:45:36,940 --> 04:45:45,020
the same headache i had like six years ago like this is the headache this is the pain

2974
04:45:45,100 --> 04:45:52,460
that i felt in my face that would not go away um and then it like just suddenly went away like a little later

2975
04:45:54,780 --> 04:45:57,420
uh and i'm like whatever so

2976
04:46:00,140 --> 04:46:05,420
and like no this this is not it this is this something wrong this one very very wrong

2977
04:46:06,060 --> 04:46:14,060
and the pain just traveled like in between the crease of your eye you know the nose the bridge of your nose

2978
04:46:14,620 --> 04:46:18,460
and that's where the pain was the bridge of my nose in between my eyebrows

2979
04:46:21,180 --> 04:46:23,020
um yeah

2980
04:46:26,620 --> 04:46:30,460
and it just it was like vibrating throughout my whole head

2981
04:46:31,100 --> 04:46:33,020
like starting from the front of my face

2982
04:46:33,740 --> 04:46:45,180
it was like that it was like wouldn't stop suddenly every light in my vicinity every bright light

2983
04:46:46,140 --> 04:46:52,380
i couldn't open my eyes if i opened my eyes the headache got worse it was so

2984
04:46:53,180 --> 04:47:01,260
bad i had to go home had to go home i do not remember if they called the hospital or not

2985
04:47:03,980 --> 04:47:21,820
my uh my uh my mom wasn't very um mom in back then she didn't mom back then um when i was working

2986
04:47:22,300 --> 04:47:26,940
she didn't want to come get me she had a car at the time and she didn't want to come get me

2987
04:47:27,500 --> 04:47:31,020
because she was sleeping and i was working late night it was like

2988
04:47:31,020 --> 04:47:37,260
uh 10 in the morning not 10 in the morning sorry 10 at night or something like that

2989
04:47:38,060 --> 04:47:44,940
she didn't want to come get me and i worked that late night shift and i was very far away

2990
04:47:44,940 --> 04:47:55,580
from home so i had to pay like 160 something dollars no i'm reading that it was this it was

2991
04:47:55,580 --> 04:48:04,860
70 something dollars for a cab to take me home because i couldn't

2992
04:48:06,060 --> 04:48:12,140
kind of ride it on train or bus or anywhere i can take public transportation

2993
04:48:17,980 --> 04:48:21,660
so i ended up going home

2994
04:48:21,980 --> 04:48:32,380
and then i went home and then i just remember being in excruciating pain and i couldn't come

2995
04:48:32,380 --> 04:48:39,740
into work for the next two days because i wasn't just i don't i can't remember it was really bad

2996
04:48:41,500 --> 04:48:46,620
it was so bad that my brain is literally blocking out a majority of my memory

2997
04:48:47,580 --> 04:48:53,340
but it was really bad and then i had to go to the er and the er did a

2998
04:48:54,620 --> 04:49:02,060
um they wouldn't like uh they wouldn't like really check me out as it was an emergency

2999
04:49:03,820 --> 04:49:10,940
they wouldn't check me out i went to the er and they were like well since it's like

3000
04:49:11,900 --> 04:49:18,380
your head and stuff we don't have the equipment to test you for anything

3001
04:49:22,940 --> 04:49:24,860
we don't have any we can't help you

3002
04:49:27,980 --> 04:49:36,060
so i was there for like six hours and they had me sitting in a chair and they refused to see me

3003
04:49:36,940 --> 04:49:50,940
uh and then i remember them giving me pain meds and a referral to go see a professional in that

3004
04:49:50,940 --> 04:49:53,900
record and i had to wait

3005
04:50:02,220 --> 04:50:06,700
no they didn't give me pain meds it was after they gave me pain meds after

3006
04:50:07,340 --> 04:50:10,940
it was after the second trip to the er because i had to go a second time

3007
04:50:11,580 --> 04:50:17,260
because the pain got even worse it was it was the second trip i went to the er

3008
04:50:17,660 --> 04:50:26,060
wait after uh so i they referred me to a professional and i had to wait to see the i had to wait

3009
04:50:27,820 --> 04:50:36,220
three months to see the professional and and while waiting in between that time while waiting

3010
04:50:36,220 --> 04:50:43,340
i had to go back to the er because i was in too much pain i couldn't sleep i went like days without

3011
04:50:43,340 --> 04:50:50,380
sleep i was in so much pain to the point where i would pass out just to sleep i'd pass out i would

3012
04:50:50,380 --> 04:50:57,740
cry i was crying i remember crying crying and crying and wanting it to just end

3013
04:50:59,500 --> 04:51:09,020
i wow what's that crying i just wanted it over i wanted it to end it was like the worst pain ever

3014
04:51:13,500 --> 04:51:22,860
i don't think i'll ever experience pain like that ever again and i never want to go through that again

3015
04:51:28,460 --> 04:51:31,020
am i better now yes don't worry i'm better now

3016
04:51:32,060 --> 04:51:37,500
what's better now it was just the whole process of all of it and then missing that appointment

3017
04:51:37,500 --> 04:51:42,860
after three months and then running out of pain meds i ran out of pain meds

3018
04:51:44,700 --> 04:51:49,020
after the three months and then i had to i had to wait another three months

3019
04:51:50,300 --> 04:51:52,940
because they didn't want to schedule me any earlier

3020
04:51:54,860 --> 04:52:01,100
another three months and then the er never gave me another refill for the pain meds so it was in pain again

3021
04:52:01,100 --> 04:52:09,660
and then for the whole three months and then i finally saw the doctor and he gave me medication and

3022
04:52:10,620 --> 04:52:21,980
i remember my face swelling like a balloon it was so big my face was massive my head was huge

3023
04:52:22,620 --> 04:52:27,020
i felt like my eyeballs was gonna pop out of my my fucking head

3024
04:52:27,900 --> 04:52:35,580
oh gosh i was just remembering it as alice as so much

3025
04:52:35,580 --> 04:52:54,620
it was it was horrible

3026
04:52:57,580 --> 04:53:04,220
and then the doctor treated me well he found out i had chronic severe chronic sinusitis

3027
04:53:05,580 --> 04:53:10,780
i had lymph like what do you call them the lymph nodes or something and some other stuff

3028
04:53:11,500 --> 04:53:19,020
all up in there i had like everything all of the above it was where i had tissue infected tissue

3029
04:53:19,020 --> 04:53:27,100
that spread near close to my brain and they said if it was left untreated for another like

3030
04:53:27,100 --> 04:53:33,740
year or so and more that it probably would have spread to my spine and then maybe eventually

3031
04:53:33,740 --> 04:53:37,820
became the bigsy so

3032
04:53:44,060 --> 04:53:50,460
so that mass that i found um they found in my nose wasn't even found during that appointment

3033
04:53:51,900 --> 04:53:58,940
during that entire timespan the mass that was found in my nose was at a place and no other doctors

3034
04:53:58,940 --> 04:54:03,980
have heard about they kept sending me to a different place that took x-rays and they were like

3035
04:54:03,980 --> 04:54:09,900
oh we found a mass in your nose why not probably not that big of a problem and then they gave me

3036
04:54:09,900 --> 04:54:16,460
like a cd scan or the cat scan or whatever you want to call it they gave me it i remember sleeping

3037
04:54:16,460 --> 04:54:21,500
in this machine i had to sit in this machine for three hours while they were scanning my face

3038
04:54:21,500 --> 04:54:31,500
and they uh they didn't find they didn't find anything else just the mass and then uh i went to

3039
04:54:31,500 --> 04:54:36,860
the doctor and told him about it and then they were like from where did you go and i was like this

3040
04:54:36,860 --> 04:54:41,980
place and they're like never heard of it so i had to do it all again at a different place

3041
04:54:44,220 --> 04:54:47,660
and that took two years to do two whole years

3042
04:54:52,140 --> 04:54:57,740
um you know there's so much and i hope you know how to go through this ad again

3043
04:54:58,460 --> 04:55:07,820
me too me too not fine though now um then i had my first ever surgery

3044
04:55:09,740 --> 04:55:17,180
they scheduled me for surgery last year last year february last year february

3045
04:55:18,060 --> 04:55:25,980
so i have been fine for the past year uh just i was healing a lot uh afterwards there was a lot of

3046
04:55:26,700 --> 04:55:33,020
a lot of bleeding i couldn't blow my nose i had to be careful with sneezing

3047
04:55:33,900 --> 04:55:41,340
because if i sneezed it was just red everywhere red red

3048
04:55:41,740 --> 04:55:50,780
i had to be careful with holding my head down or it would just leak red everywhere red

3049
04:55:54,780 --> 04:55:59,900
so i had to lay in bed because i was on like heavy medication i just woke up from anesthesia

3050
04:55:59,900 --> 04:56:01,740
and i was just like laying there like uh

3051
04:56:02,060 --> 04:56:11,740
i was so nervous i waited so long to get the surgery because they they said they'll wait

3052
04:56:11,740 --> 04:56:18,860
because they knew i was really scared because he did um the doctor did warn me that it was very

3053
04:56:18,860 --> 04:56:27,020
close to my brain um that there could be chance that if they were to mess with anything like

3054
04:56:27,980 --> 04:56:36,300
hit anything that it could affect my personality my emotions and something else and i remember

3055
04:56:37,340 --> 04:56:44,540
and then they were like then the other doctor i know it's like procedure and i have to tell you

3056
04:56:44,540 --> 04:56:48,780
that you could possibly you know perish

3057
04:56:49,340 --> 04:56:54,540
but the way he said it to me scared the living

3058
04:56:55,340 --> 04:57:02,380
let me shut out of me okay and that's why i waited he scared me so much

3059
04:57:06,060 --> 04:57:09,900
he was like and death and he gave me a look like

3060
04:57:10,620 --> 04:57:13,020
oh

3061
04:57:18,140 --> 04:57:25,020
no we didn't finish the game we're just trying it up we're gonna play the game next week next

3062
04:57:25,020 --> 04:57:33,020
week on stay that's likely

3063
04:57:33,260 --> 04:57:42,700
so i was on a bunch of medication for that whole timespan i was on like

3064
04:57:43,740 --> 04:57:53,260
so much pain meds antibiotics uh stuff for my stomach i was on uh like

3065
04:57:54,540 --> 04:58:00,540
some some other stuff i don't remember what for so i was on that and then i was on it for

3066
04:58:01,340 --> 04:58:07,500
uh the headaches because this is before they found out about my spine and my shoulder

3067
04:58:08,460 --> 04:58:16,300
this is before that so i had that and i was on i i i messed up my knees

3068
04:58:17,500 --> 04:58:20,140
i had all accident so my knees are messed up

3069
04:58:23,660 --> 04:58:29,980
i only have physical things wrong with me it's not that bad i know people got it worse so

3070
04:58:30,540 --> 04:58:33,900
i just went through some really messed up experiences all of these things could have

3071
04:58:33,900 --> 04:58:42,620
been caught and fixed if the doctors weren't so dismissive of me uh and actually believed me

3072
04:58:42,620 --> 04:58:48,940
one doctor told me that it was all in my head another doctor told me that uh that i was only

3073
04:58:48,940 --> 04:58:55,580
coming in for the pain medication they were saying that i was an addict uh another doc another

3074
04:58:55,580 --> 04:59:01,420
doctor turned me away uh because i came too much too frequently uh because i was in pain

3075
04:59:02,780 --> 04:59:15,020
um i also had uh the uh i had an ovarian ovarian ovarian cyst on my left ovary that burst

3076
04:59:16,940 --> 04:59:22,620
i had to call 911 for that one i couldn't walk i couldn't move i couldn't do anything

3077
04:59:22,940 --> 04:59:25,980
and 911 came and picked me up

3078
04:59:28,700 --> 04:59:32,700
um uh it did a little

3079
04:59:37,900 --> 04:59:44,060
i felt it and heard it uh when it did uh when it popped i was taking a massive

3080
04:59:44,620 --> 04:59:47,820
a mash of shit on the toilet

3081
04:59:50,940 --> 04:59:55,900
i was i was constipated i was taking a massive

3082
04:59:55,900 --> 05:00:05,180
massive poop and i strained too hard and all i felt and heard was and i was like ah what was that

3083
05:00:05,820 --> 05:00:12,860
that was weird and then the pain gradually got worse and i'm like ah

3084
05:00:18,460 --> 05:00:20,860
and i was like dragging myself on the floor like

3085
05:00:25,100 --> 05:00:27,260
when my pants down half down

3086
05:00:28,060 --> 05:00:33,420
i was calling out to my mom

3087
05:00:44,460 --> 05:00:51,260
wait did you wipe first nothing came out i was straining i said i was constipated nothing came out

3088
05:00:57,500 --> 05:00:59,260
i was taking the poop

3089
05:01:07,340 --> 05:01:14,700
then they took a like a like a uh ultrasound of the cyst and it was the size of a tennis ball

3090
05:01:14,700 --> 05:01:21,340
it was massive it was huge it was like a massive cyst on my on my left ovary it was massive

3091
05:01:21,340 --> 05:01:29,740
and just like a little bit of it like popped so i was bleeding only inside

3092
05:01:31,100 --> 05:01:32,620
so i was a well tennis ball

3093
05:01:43,820 --> 05:01:48,300
they were worried they they had to monitor me i was in the hospital for two days that day

3094
05:01:48,380 --> 05:01:55,740
they had to monitor me to make sure i didn't like you know bleed out eternally

3095
05:01:56,540 --> 05:02:02,860
and uh since i'm also like anemic slightly on the borderline uh the more blood i lost

3096
05:02:06,460 --> 05:02:12,220
it was cold and i was very tired so i had to uh they had to be careful

3097
05:02:13,340 --> 05:02:17,580
um so they wanted to watch me and monitor me they took so much blood for me

3098
05:02:17,580 --> 05:02:20,300
that's how they had to monitor me they took so much

3099
05:02:25,980 --> 05:02:26,700
it was a lot

3100
05:02:34,860 --> 05:02:41,420
yeah i got to break uh i'm uh i've been through quite a lot over the past couple of years

3101
05:02:42,060 --> 05:02:49,580
so that's all right though it's what made me me makes me me makes me who i am

3102
05:02:49,980 --> 05:02:55,820
i suppose pray i'm just very accepting i guess

3103
05:02:59,820 --> 05:03:04,060
and i have many other stories but we could save those for the other side

3104
05:03:05,260 --> 05:03:08,380
right now this is just my some of my medical stories

3105
05:03:12,060 --> 05:03:15,980
so i'm just glad i'm off quite a couple of the meds now i'm not on a lot of them

3106
05:03:15,980 --> 05:03:23,180
so i'm happy now right i am and i only hope for better things i didn't have a lot of support

3107
05:03:23,180 --> 05:03:30,460
as i was getting older i had to do everything myself so i guess you could say i matured way too early

3108
05:03:30,460 --> 05:03:37,500
for my for the age that i was when i was younger i had to do everything myself

3109
05:03:37,580 --> 05:03:43,660
i had to teach myself many things that many young young girls should definitely have already

3110
05:03:43,660 --> 05:03:47,420
been taught i had to teach it to myself so yeah

3111
05:03:55,340 --> 05:04:01,180
wait some yeah because there is a lot of girls that aren't taught these things i mean as in some as in

3112
05:04:01,180 --> 05:04:06,300
like the glass half full kind of thing i mean there are some girls out there that don't know

3113
05:04:06,300 --> 05:04:13,420
currently that they're they were like me there's a lot that do know right now i mean some as in

3114
05:04:13,420 --> 05:04:20,300
there are some girls out there who still right now at this moment still aren't taught about hygiene

3115
05:04:21,580 --> 05:04:24,300
as they should be taught even now

3116
05:04:37,100 --> 05:04:48,940
uh i've been there a bit i've had my extreme extreme downs extreme downs my therapist was four

3117
05:04:53,980 --> 05:05:00,700
we don't talk about those those are not what i'm gonna cover anytime soon maybe like

3118
05:05:01,020 --> 05:05:03,100
like years later down the line

3119
05:05:22,780 --> 05:05:27,820
but i also had my ups so i was satisfied i found some people who support me

3120
05:05:28,540 --> 05:05:36,140
and my endeavors so i'm very happy um and a lot of family issues i've had

3121
05:05:36,140 --> 05:05:43,660
has been sorted out so yeah i just need to to eventually find a place of my own so i can

3122
05:05:43,660 --> 05:05:51,900
do my own thing yeah let's go do my own thing yeah i wanted my own thing

3123
05:05:52,140 --> 05:05:59,500
and i want to pursue this v-tubing thing that i'm doing right now um quite some time

3124
05:06:02,140 --> 05:06:05,980
it's my uh main source of of living

3125
05:06:14,460 --> 05:06:15,820
i hope you all understand

3126
05:06:16,620 --> 05:06:22,860
i am totally understandable i understand

3127
05:06:26,860 --> 05:06:28,220
thank you i'm glad

3128
05:06:35,180 --> 05:06:41,580
i know it's less important but i feel like we aren't uh we aren't taught proper hygiene either

3129
05:06:41,660 --> 05:06:45,260
and i think guys aren't taught proper hygiene either as well

3130
05:06:47,980 --> 05:06:55,100
i know one thing for for sure is that there are guys who actually truly believe that you don't wipe

3131
05:06:56,140 --> 05:07:00,380
that you don't need to wipe the the pepe the pepe

3132
05:07:01,340 --> 05:07:10,380
uh but uh the the the pepe there's there's there's there's actually guys out there who

3133
05:07:10,380 --> 05:07:16,380
aren't taught that or don't know or other guys taught them not to do it so it's not their fault

3134
05:07:16,380 --> 05:07:23,900
really but there are guys who teach other guys that i have been around quite a few of them

3135
05:07:24,060 --> 05:07:33,500
um in the past long long time ago don't talk to them anymore though because they were um

3136
05:07:34,220 --> 05:07:36,300
they're rude they're rude people

3137
05:07:41,500 --> 05:07:49,260
but if you are a guy that don't know about wiping you do wipe you do you do a tap tap

3138
05:07:49,420 --> 05:07:54,780
you could take just one or two squares and do a tap tap you tap it up tap it up tap it up tap

3139
05:07:54,780 --> 05:08:01,180
up tap up the tip tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap and wipe

3140
05:08:04,220 --> 05:08:09,500
there's nothing too extremely it's like yes a lot of people might find it gross but it is what it is

3141
05:08:10,060 --> 05:08:16,460
so don't judge too harshly understand their situations or circumstances that they probably

3142
05:08:16,460 --> 05:08:27,260
weren't taught

3143
05:08:31,580 --> 05:08:32,140
it's okay

3144
05:08:35,660 --> 05:08:39,100
and i understand the little jokies that are made where you know

3145
05:08:39,100 --> 05:08:45,900
oh yeah people just helicopter it up

3146
05:09:10,060 --> 05:09:15,260
this is not a joke this is not the sacred ritual i wouldn't know

3147
05:09:20,540 --> 05:09:22,620
it requires a lot of rhythm

3148
05:09:24,780 --> 05:09:29,900
i'm working them hips huh we're working them hips

3149
05:09:39,100 --> 05:09:48,700
it's not just the way but leaving the washroom and not washing hands

3150
05:09:50,620 --> 05:09:58,700
please please wash your hands please wash your hands i know there are guys who don't

3151
05:09:58,700 --> 05:10:08,860
who don't even need to use hands hands free but still wash your hands wash them wash

3152
05:10:09,100 --> 05:10:14,060
your hands you touch the door knobs you touch the doors you had to come into there

3153
05:10:14,060 --> 05:10:21,900
you had to leave you had to touch things wash your hands it is gross that is gross wash your hands

3154
05:10:22,460 --> 05:10:35,100
all right as long as you wash your hands

3155
05:10:38,940 --> 05:10:40,700
someone's gonna run for it boys

3156
05:10:41,660 --> 05:10:42,300
hahaha

3157
05:10:47,980 --> 05:10:52,300
bring it around town bring it around town

3158
05:10:57,100 --> 05:11:00,700

3159
05:11:01,100 --> 05:11:11,740
do you wash your hands it's good good good don't worry it's not just boys

3160
05:11:11,740 --> 05:11:17,020
i know girls that do the same thing a lot of boys don't know this but there are girls

3161
05:11:17,020 --> 05:11:23,420
that literally don't even like they don't clean up after themselves trust trust

3162
05:11:24,380 --> 05:11:28,620
don't think just because a lot of girls bathrooms are like super spotless sometimes

3163
05:11:28,620 --> 05:11:34,140
and has like pretty plants and stuff but those bathrooms are disgusting

3164
05:11:34,940 --> 05:11:42,860
you see things that you don't want to see don't want to see things left unflushed

3165

sequence

3168
05:13:12,860 --> 05:13:25,860
We do not harshly judge them as they're probably, like I said, not taught, not taught, didn't learn, learned the hard way, self-taught, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

3169
05:13:28,860 --> 05:13:35,860
I knew of girls that didn't even know about shaving at all, like overall.

3170
05:13:36,860 --> 05:13:49,860
And it becomes very unhygienic not to shave or trim because if hairs get really long, too long, you can accumulate bacteria and stuff.

3171
05:13:50,860 --> 05:14:01,860
And women are very susceptible to UTIs, it's easier for women to get them the most.

3172
05:14:02,860 --> 05:14:11,860
So we gotta take cleanly, like so you take care of your little beddies, take care of your little beddies.

3173
05:14:13,860 --> 05:14:27,860
It's called a urinary tract infection, you get an infection in the, in your bladder basically, or in the, your, your, your itta.

3174
05:14:28,860 --> 05:14:44,860
Yeah, guys can get it too, but you guys get less, less chance of them getting it because you know, you guys have a longer ways to getting to the bladder unlike women.

3175
05:14:45,860 --> 05:14:55,860
Got shorter, shorter ways of getting there, so bacteria can travel faster, easier for women than for men.

3176
05:14:58,860 --> 05:15:03,860
Is that like guineastones? No.

3177
05:15:04,860 --> 05:15:12,860
But I think the pain could be similar, the pain could be similar.

3178
05:15:28,860 --> 05:15:33,860
Oh my god, I'm not gonna read that.

3179
05:15:37,860 --> 05:15:41,860
Yeah, so hygiene is very important, so make sure you take care of yourself.

3180
05:15:41,860 --> 05:16:04,860
Yeah, I think you have a fire, we'll take care of it, stay clean in that regard, and you won't have to worry, at least you don't have your, your parents telling you it's gonna fall off.

3181
05:16:12,860 --> 05:16:29,860
I heard that's what a lot of, a lot of boys got told when they were younger that it was gonna fall off as they don't take care of it.

3182
05:16:30,860 --> 05:16:31,860
Yeah.

3183
05:16:35,860 --> 05:16:37,860
And even as a student.

3184
05:16:41,860 --> 05:16:43,860
My grandma says that.

3185
05:17:00,860 --> 05:17:05,860
