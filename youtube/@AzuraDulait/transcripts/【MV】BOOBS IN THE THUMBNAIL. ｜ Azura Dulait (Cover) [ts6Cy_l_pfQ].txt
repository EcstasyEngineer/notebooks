This one goes out to all of y'all who's struggling to get high views on YouTube
I'm about to tell you the secret that no one knows about except me
Cause I just figured it out Listen carefully, boys and girls
Ayo, it's the never one falcon lover back Now sit down, relax, hear her have a snack
Have a mountain to six pack I'm sorry if my grammar's wack
But we're getting off the track The song is about Iraq
No, I'm not talking about the nation I'm gonna tell you all about the great titillation
If you're first at videos for more interviews And some nice music news that might come to you
We've all been there, we all have struggled We tried to pay for subs, they just said no to scrubs
We tried to do collabs, they just gave you some crowds
You tried to false flags, you didn't mess up false flags
Was the secret to you two views? There must be a trick
Are they part of the monotony? No, I swear they can't be it
Do they work really hard? Do they commit?
You've got it all wrong, the secret lies in the tip
Blue's in the thumbnail, bitch

Give some money out of winning, fucking quick
Blue's in the thumbnail, bitch

Run your mom, then you gotta think about it twice
Blue's in the thumbnail, bitch

The trick is simple, I learned from the best
The secret lies within my messy, fully blessed chest
