soupas,
super chat.
If you put in a description
of what you want, like a small
description on your soupa
for 15, I think.
So that I have time.
So that I have time.
15 on your soupa
and your description.
I didn't turn this on
because I'm a dummy.
I'm so dumb.
Did I not add this?
I swear I did.
What's right here?
The text. I have to change the color.
Here we go.
No, that's not it. That's the wrong one.
Dumb.
Dumb.
I think that's it, right?
Do I do that right?
I'm super sculpt.
It's super sculpt.
I draw a little doodle for you.
With your soupa.
Dumb.
You love your eye.
I love you too.
When you fill up.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much for the $15 tip.
This does this.
My ideal house.
My ideal house.
Thank you so much for the $15 tip.
My ideal house.
I mean, I guess it would be like...
Thank you for the soupa.
I really appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
I mean, I want a backyard.
I want a backyard.
Not too big.
Just something to have like a small little garden in it.
You know the rain protector?
This is from like the top view.
So I guess.
And then like a side gate.
Big fences.
Around it.
A side gate that has like a really nice path.
But this is for a house.
And then steps that like.
Go like this.
And then like a small little gate.
And then the front door here.
And then the front door here.
And a little window.
Is this a yard?
This is a toilet and this would be like the bathroom.
Like a shower and a tub.
I think chat broke.
For me.
My chat has frozen.
So broke.
Oh, it's back.
All this broke.
That's all it does.
Oh, it's back. It's back.
Now it's gone.
So I'm so happy.
And then like stairs that go up.
On the side.
That go up.
To an upstairs.
And then like.
I guess.
This would be.
This would be a kitchen.
So like.
The cabinets.
Or stove and stuff.
Like that.
And an island.
And then.
Some plants or something.
And then this would be like the living space.
So this would be like the lead outside to the backyard.
So this would be like the door or sliding door.
It would be like a little sliding door.
And.
I don't know.
It gives.
A bookshelf.
With the TV on the side.
And then like a couch.
Or something.
Or area to sit.
Or.
Baby.

I gotta ask, new outfit?
Mostly casual, I believe you want to stay monetized, right?
But I think Strone already talked about that before on our streams prior.
That we'd be getting like cover-ups very soon.
And that they're already in the works and being worked on, you know?
Say so, toggle, yeah it's gonna be needed.
So that I definitely stay monetized.
Yeah, definitely being say so.

What about a sweater or something?
I would love to wear a sweater like a turtleneck.
I want a turtleneck.
I think it'd be so cute.
