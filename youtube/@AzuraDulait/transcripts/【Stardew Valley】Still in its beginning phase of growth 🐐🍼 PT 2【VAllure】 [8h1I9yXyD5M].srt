26
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,240
fine and then all of a sudden i started streaming and it turns off and on and off

27
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:56,080
and on and off and on so i had to give my mom my mom had to come and help me to turn it back on

28
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,320
she's like all right we're gonna have to call them we have to call them and see what's going on

29
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,840
you can literally see it in the thingy and behind me the chat over there behind me you see

30
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,880
when it disconnects reconnects disconnects reconnects it was doing that the whole time

31
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,720
and then it would like be okay for like for for a little long while and then it would just break

32
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:37,440
all over again so she was like at two o'clock which was right when we were gonna start streaming

33
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:45,280
she she goes to me oh well they have to turn the internet off for 10 minutes to check the

34
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:55,440
connection to see why it's doing it 10 minutes so as i was like gone i couldn't start streaming

35
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,840
for the first 20 minutes because they had to check the internet

36
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,000
it was so chaotic it was like so much going on

37
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,200
that was a super fun club

38
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:41,280
i enjoyed it i'm sorry i'm not i was not very talkative joining in but yeah

39
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:50,080
being in a like a like a in a group it's a little harder to like talk over other people

40
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,760
i'm not the really type to do that so i tend to be a little more quieter when in when in a group

41
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,480
so i'm sorry

42
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:06,160
i'm not i'm not an extreme talkative person overall i must like i'm talking like right now

43
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,200
so i didn't i felt a little rude trying to talk over everyone

44
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,800
so i was a little quiet

45
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,280
yes i quietly vibe and group calls

46
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,680
besides the other girls are extremely energetic they have so much energy for you guys more than me

47
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,480
so that's okay

48
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,120

53
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,120

i don't have a tablet i've been using my my ipad

61

I'm back.

105
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,420
I'm back.

106
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,440
I'm home.

107
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,440
I want to be here in the chat room with you.

108
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,420
Yes I'm home.

109
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:04,440
What the heck?

110
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:34,440
umbre

111
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,480
tires

112
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,480

Margaret

115
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
What is this?

116
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
It's pissing me off.

117
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
Is it because I'm eating a hot dog?

118
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,440
I found hot dogs.

119
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,440
I saw one made hot dogs, I'm eating it.

120
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,440
But I did say, I think, if, I don't know if you heard me or not, but I did say I'd stream

121
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,440
around this time in the future.

122
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,440
Majority of my streams are at night, but that was just for the beginning.

123
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,440
I'm getting in to the valour.

124
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,440
We wanted to have a consistent stream time, but

125
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:12,440
but I do plan to do noon streams or morning streams in the future.

126
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,440
So maybe one day you'll be able to catch those streams as well.

127
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:44,440
I have no clue why it's so broken.

128
00:19:44,440 --> 00:20:12,440
I Google that anyone who's running on like the same Internet kind of

129
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,440
service is having issues as well.

130
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
It's not just me.

131
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,440
It seems to be like a whole city wide thing.

132
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:59,440
I was extremely fun and chaotic club.

133
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
I enjoyed that a lot.

134
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,440
Oh, that was so good.

135
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,440
Happy.

136
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
I think we're back though, right?

137
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,440
No issues right now.

138
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
I could go for another hot dog.

139
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
Oh no.

140
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,440
No, please.

141
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,440
Help.

142
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
I hear a fine.

143
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,440
We're fine.

144
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,440
Having consistency is totally fine.

145
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,440
It's also better for your planning as well.

146
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
But I'm all right.

147
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
I'll just look forward to times.

148
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,440
I'll be able to watch.

149
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
I'm glad.

150
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,440
I'm happy you understand.

151
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Thank you.

152
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,440
I'm so sorry.

153
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,440
I feel a little bad streaming at such EU times.

154
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,440
But I am a cozy streamer.

155
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:49,440
So I thought that streaming at night would be a way better than streaming midday.

156
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
You know.

157
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,440
But then I realized that there's so many of you who are in different time zones.

158
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,440
So I didn't really think to put you into it.

159
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:16,440
I just said, well, that's nighttime for me when I want to feel the cozy is right before bed.

160
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
So I chose that time to stream.

161
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,440
It's 421 for me as well.

162
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
It's 421 pm for me.

163
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,440
I usually just been streaming around 8 o'clock.

164
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,440
And that's the time this stream was supposed to have took place.

165
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,440
Let me pull this game up.

166
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,440
I'm a little sad though.

167
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
I really wanted to play it in powerwatch.

168
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,440
It's really my first time playing it.

169
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,440
And it just went like a...

170
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,440
It went so chaotic.

171
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
I'm so sad.

172
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,440
I'm so sad.

173
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,440
I'm so sad.

174
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
I'm so sad.

175
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
I'm so sad.

176
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
I'm so sad.

177
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
I'm so sad.

178
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
I'm so sad.

179
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
I'm so sad.

180
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,440
I'm so sad.

181
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
I'm so sad.

182
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
I'm so chaotic.

183
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,440
So bad.

184
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
I'm so chaotic.

185
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,440
And hopefully we'll be able to play it next time.

186
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,440
I will look forward to next time.

187
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
Maybe my internet will be better.

188
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,440
It will be better than...

189
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Right now I'm running on like the cheapest internet ever in my city.

190
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,440
I can't afford...

191
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:54,440
I can't afford the other internet stuff.

192
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,440
So yeah, the cheapest internet.

193
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,440
So it goes down every now and then.

194
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,440
I don't have a life that I guess I'm gonna do.

195
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,440
Yay!

196
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
I don't have one either.

197
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
This is my life.

198
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
This is my life.

199
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,440
Yay!

200
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
I don't like raccoons.

201
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,440
You know, they're more active at night.

202
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
Okay.

203
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,440
And our stud.

204
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,440
I have fun time Friday.

205
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,440
I hope you get an upgrade in the future.

206
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
Yeah.

207
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,440
With all of your support and help.

208
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,440
I'm sure I will probably have better internet.

209
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,440
A better internet anytime.

210
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,440
I'm sure, I'm sure.

211
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,440
Yeah, the club is extremely fun.

212
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
I also can't wait for more.

213
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
Alright.

214
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
Wow!

215
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
Nope.

216
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Oh, sorry.

217
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,440
I'm so not...

218
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,440
I'm so unprepared.

219
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,440
Flight everything.

220
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,440
Yeah.

221
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,440
I'm so cold.

222
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,440
Arctic and docksbox are absolutely good at clubs for sure, yeah.

223
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,440
They were our heroes saved us.

224
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,440
Just still being able to do something.

225
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,440
Yeah.

226
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,440
It was the best paraglider simulation.

227
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,440
The best.

228
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,440
Alright guys, let me know if my microphone is peaking or something.

229
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,440
Do not hesitate to tell me okay.

230
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,440
Do not let me have poopy mic like before.

231
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,440
Yeah, play more stars in the valley.

232
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
Yeah.

233
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
BGM is on.

234
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
Why is this game so loud?

235
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,440
What the hell?

236
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
Why is it so loud?

237
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Hang on.

238
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,440
Is this game not loud for anyone else?

239
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
BGM is on.

240
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,440
You didn't see any of those.

241
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
Sorry.

242
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,440
You didn't see any of those?

243
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,440
You didn't see any of those?

244
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,440
Okay, that wasn't there.

245
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Why is this so loud?

246
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,440
Why is this so loud?

247
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,440
Why is this so loud?

Why is this so loud?

249
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,440
Why is this so loud?

250
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,440
Why is this so loud?

Why is this so loud?

Why is this so loud?

Why is this so loud?

265
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
Why is this so much louder than the noise?

266
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
Why is this so loud?

267
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,440
Why is this so loud?

268
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,440
Why is this so loud when you play?

269
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,440
Why is this so loud when you take mi unterstüt or微 звон insurance?

270
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
Why did you do something Zhi did to scare your song?

271
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,440
It's a mystery to me that I haven't played sticky rice files before.

272
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
It's a mystery to me that I haven't played sticky rice phones before.

I can't.

This is just too loud for me.

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,720
This is just too loud for me.

It's none of this.

297
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
It's just so loud.

298
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
It's just so loud.

299
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
Is it quiet for you guys now?

300
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
It's so loud.

301
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,720
It's so much better.

302
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,720
I did.

303
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,720
It's completely lowered for me.

304
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,720
It's at 15%

305
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,720
and it's just blasting in my ears.

306
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
I tried.

307
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
It was not working.

308
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
Everything is still so loud.

309
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
I don't know what the cause is.

310
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
Why all of a sudden it's so loud?

311
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,720
Yeah, it does.

312
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
I turned it down

313
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
as well.

314
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,720
But I want to also make sure I hear

315
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,720
notifications and stuff.

316
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,720
I turn it back up a little bit

317
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,720
for you guys.

318
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
Just a little bit.

319
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,720
It's like all my settings

320
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,720
reset somehow.

321
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,720
It's so strange.

322
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Hi everyone.

323
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
Hi.

324
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Right now we're just going to play.

325
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,720
I don't...

326
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
I can't answer yet.

327
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,720
Oh, that's what that is.

328
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,720
This is fine.

329
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,720
Everything is fine.

330
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,720
It's so loud.

331
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,720
It's so loud.

332
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,720
I can't answer yet.

333
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
I don't know.

334
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,720
I can't answer yet.

335
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
It's so loud.

336
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,720
I'm a little bit loud.

337
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,720
I don't know what is going on right now.

338
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,720
I don't know what is going on right now.

339
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,720
There's a stranger in my house.

340
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
I don't know what is going on right now.

341
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
I don't know.

342
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:29,720
There's no way you can be who you say you are.

343
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Gotta be someone else.

I'm not totally wasn't me.

346
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:51,720
So I don't know what you saw cause that wasn't me.

347
00:35:51,720 --> 00:36:17,720
I'm glad she went great. That was amazing. I enjoyed it.

348
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,720
I don't know what you saw cause that wasn't me.

357
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:34,720
I told you.

358
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,720
It was voted.

359
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:48,720

375
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,720
How much friendship do you lose?

376
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:52,720
I lost a whole heart.

377
00:42:52,720 --> 00:43:20,720
It's like you filthy ingrate.

378
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:44,720
I want to play the Jamias on the stream but I know I can't.

379
00:43:50,720 --> 00:44:00,720
Thank you so much and welcome back home.

Thank you, thank you.

382
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:21,720
It's so sweet of you.

383
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:27,720
I think turnips or fast cabbage might only be 4 or 5 days.

384
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:33,720
I don't think I can grow cabbage in the spring.

385
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,720
This takes a long time.

386
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,720
I don't think this grows in 4 or 5 days.

387
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,720
I think it takes much longer.

388
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:46,720
I planted this some time ago.

389
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,720
It goes on the internet.

390
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,720
I know my stream...

391
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,720
I'm glad I'm able to put a smile on all your faces.

392
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:07,720
I know my streams are very chill and very chaotic in the sense of very scuffed streams.

393
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,720
I'm probably entertaining and very annoying.
