the thing in the ASMR thing with the 3dio is really fun i'm the it was like since it was like my first time using the 3dio

162
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:22,200
as a whole i might really do it using it so i'm like figuring all the kinks out and stuff

163
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,480
i want to figure out oh i'll figure it out okay

164
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,480
yeah there's an ASMR this week yes yes yes sir

165
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:57,480
oh speaking of table table table speaking of table speaking of table someone did get

166
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:10,520
me a table um someone actually did get me a table i however i i i just um what happened was

167
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,280
um

168
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,440
what's going on here

169
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,880
someone got me a table someone asked me this in the morrow i think yeah i was anonymous

170
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,920
someone asked me in the morrow uh if i got the table i completely forgot i was gonna talk about it

171
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:41,880
in the last stream in the beginning but i forgot um i mean at the end um

172
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:52,120
it was put through a credit like some sort of credit so i gotta buy it myself with it so it's

173
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:58,760
gonna take me a little bit of time to do that so it's just sitting there waiting for me to do it

174
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:05,880
so don't worry you didn't get scammed don't worry i have to actually do it myself

175
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:22,360
so it's just sitting there you gotta wait um which is kind of good giving the fact that my

176
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:28,360
room is extremely cluttered and i really honestly didn't think anyone would get that table

177
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:37,400
i thought it was just gonna be there the entire time i appreciate it so much so i

178
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,920
didn't need a table i just didn't think it would be like given to me right now

179
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:57,240
once i make some space i'll i'll uh i'll get to that and it'll just sit here until i sort

180
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,320
stuff out and then i'm able to move i don't want to unpack it and then put it together immediately

181
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,400
you know what i mean if i'm planning on moving very soon

182
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:26,920
so sitting sitting in the credit right now and then i'll do it and then i'll get it and then i'll

183
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,560
get the table

184
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:41,000
and then each entire chazzo someone will really think that'd be the life i wouldn't have to do it myself

185
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:51,160
now you got an excuse to clean your room technically yeah but am i really gonna clean it

186
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,640
i'm kind of gonna abandon a lot of stuff in here

187
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,080
i'm kind of gonna abandon quite a lot of stuff in here

188
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,600
after i take the things that i want i'm gonna just it's free reign

189
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,280
for my uh

190
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,080
yeah

191
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:34,120
i i don't know i don't know if uh if i can take a lot of this stuff with me that's the thing

192
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:42,120
i can't take apart my bed frame because that bed frame was the first

193
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,920
bed frame i ever bought with money that i earned with my hard work

194
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,560
it was the first thing i ever bought besides the computer

195
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,760
because i was tired of sleeping on the floor

196
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:14,600
i'd be more than willing to put together

197
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:23,720
yeah yeah yeah first i had like um let's see first i slept on the floor

198
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:31,480
then i had a like a like a like a you know one of those foldable futon

199
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:32,840
beds

200
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,400
then i had that

201
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,640
like with the really tiny thin mattress then that broke

202
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,840
then i slept on just the little mattress

203
00:28:52,360 --> 00:29:01,240
and then i got a cat then my cat peed on it and then you can't get rid of cat pee smell

204
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,320
so then i had to throw that away and i slept on the floor again

205
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:14,040
and then i was lint um i keep saying lint but then i was given a mattress

206
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:20,600
like an old old used mattress from a family family member

207
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,400
so then i had a yeah

208
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:35,240
so then that was on like they gave me the not just the mattress but they gave me the bed frame

209
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:41,880
but it was a really big bed frame like it took up like a lot of the space in my room

210
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,000
so i i i got a new

211
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:55,320
uh oh did my sister move back in for a little while she moved back in

212
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:02,280
and then i had to get rid of the bed and then we got a bunk bed

213
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,000
we got a bunk bed and then i put the mattress on the top because i had to sleep on the top

214
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,040
and then i slept on the top and then my sister moved out

215
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,280
and then i got rid of the bunk bed and i bought me a new bed frame

216
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:30,520
yeah that's that's how it went

217
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,120
yeah i used to share the room with my my sister for a long time

218
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:50,200
um

219
00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:00,200
wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow

220
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,400
sorry

221
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:17,960
yeah i broke my bed frame broke like it was like a metal like really like you

222
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:24,360
know those flimsy little metal like futons one that folds i guess it like folded wrong

223
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,520
no i remember what happened so my mom decided to come into my room when i wasn't there

224
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:38,760
and i think she like like like you know how when you flop onto a bed but your whole body

225
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:45,480
you just flop onto it so she flopped onto it and she broke my bed so she broke the metal

226
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,720
part of my bed

227
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,400
she broke it

228
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:08,120
yeah that's how it broke i couldn't remember how it broke i had it for quite some time

229
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,400
it was like horrible sleeping on it but i was used to it

230
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,600
as she broke my bed

231
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:36,200
and before that oh way before that i owned a couch i didn't have a bed i didn't have a mattress

232
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,880
or a or a bed i had a couch

233
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:49,000
and my my auntie was getting rid of her her couch and i took it i took her couch

234
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,960
it was like a futon couch

235
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:59,240
you ever did that thing where you like laid on it and then you folded yourself inside

236
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,080
or like a family member inside

237
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:11,560
we used to do that a lot i stopped doing that when i heard of the story of some kids that actually got like

238
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:25,640
uh sent to the shadow realm um uh for doing that so i stopped doing it

239
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:37,720
yeah

240
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,680
yeah they got sent to the shadow realm

241
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,920
yeah i had a bed in it

242
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,160
but the couch was like really worn down and worn out creaking and breaking it was like

243
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,000
like springs were popping out of it

244
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:10,280
so i stopped i had to throw it away and i slept on the floor again yay floor again floor again

245
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,840
i used to cut myself on that spring all the time

246
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,880
it was like it was like sticking out and you'd walk past it and it would just go

247
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,880
i'm so i'm nervous to do a

248
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:58,680
a handcam stream like handcam and are all the body streams i'm probably gonna do like cover-ups

249
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,520
because i have a lot of scars

250
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,200
i'm covered in quite a lot of scars

251
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:17,240
some of them are from my cat but um some of them are from a lot of accidents that i had so

252
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:24,520
i'm not really comfortable with showing my scars

253
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,760
and i know if i show you my hands you're gonna probably say i have grandma hands

254
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,720
because i think i do

255
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:50,040
i have really really big hands they're really like big as i'm like

256
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,000

281
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:06,260
eat and drink water and stuff yeah my stomach thing was really really bad my stomach was

282
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:16,260
like very very very very very very bad i couldn't eat anything so i ended up losing like weight

283
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:23,540
like beyond what i i i should have eaten

284
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:38,500
i was like super afraid to eat anything because i was scared my stomach was gonna start hurting

285
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,820
and then when someone convinced me to finally eat i'd eat it and then my fears would come true

286
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:49,540
my stomach was starting i didn't understand my allergies at the time i didn't know i was

287
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:55,780
like lactose intolerant to that degree and i didn't know i was lack i was sugar intolerant

288
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:03,060
i didn't know i was i was allergic to sugar uh i'm not allergic intolerant to sugar i didn't know

289
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:11,700
i couldn't really eat bread a lot like a lot a lot of bread i couldn't i didn't know any of this

290
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,980
information so every time i consumed it i would have like humongous stomach aches

291
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:25,700
and then i had like a bunch of stomach acid so it would like go up and i would always constantly

292
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:31,860
feel the need to like even when nothing was in there because it would hit my esophagus

293
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:39,940
so i had a erosion i had all the problems i had did you try yogurt yogurt has milk in it too

294
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,660
yogurt has milk in it

295
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:51,060
i have to find brands of yogurt that didn't have milk in it and i don't know brands

296
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:05,460
i try lactose free milk but for some reason oh yeah the sugar there you go

297
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,260
there's sugar in some milk

298
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:20,980
so it was hard i had to i had to find i had to finally start drinking almond milk

299
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:26,980
i made a mistake and accidentally bought the sweetened version which has sugar in it

300
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:35,460
and that does it that it messed me up it messed me up

301
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,620
it messed me up it's horrible

302
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:48,180
i don't mind i just laugh about it i know all of you are probably like sad

303
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:54,980
that i'm talking about it but this is just i'm i this is just an experience

304
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:01,860
like i was just happy to finally find out what the fuck was wrong with me

305
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:11,620
i was happy to find out i didn't have anything extremely wrong with me or something like hella bad

306
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:27,540
because um i had a lot of like internal bleeding and they were very concerned like like we don't know what is causing this like that's that's bad

307
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:38,500
but they they were like finding out that my my like whole track system was just messed up from all the things i've been eating

308
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:50,900
and my mom was so confused she's like we've been eating these things for so long nothing was wrong

309
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:59,220
and i had to ask her i said mom have you had a normal poo poo she's like i guess she's like so you haven't had

310
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,940
a solid poo poo she was like no actually i haven't

311
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:17,380
she just thought it was normal she just thought it was normal to have have bad poo poo

312
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,940
because she's also lactose intolerant she's probably also sugar intolerant

313
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,380
but she never got that check

314
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:43,380
yeah

315
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:55,380
oh

316
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:04,100
but sorry my back is like

317
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:13,540
okay well let's open up one side now we've chatted for a little bit

318
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:22,500
oh excuse me that was so soft it's like you have a burp and it doesn't come out like

319
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,620
it comes out here like the burp usually happens like in your mouth

320
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:30,980
but that burp happened like in my esophagus that was so weird

321
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,500
and like my whole throat rumbled from that

322
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,500
that was weird

323
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:43,380
aa

324
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,000

00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,680

darkness time for penguin boy

336
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,120
let's go

337
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,200
how did my stomach handle the rice?

338
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,380
rice is fine, I don't know why

339
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:40,420
it's a really weird thing i can eat rice but like bread bread uh

340
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,820
because bread has sugar in it it's harder to eat bread

341
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,620
because the bread here in america has sugar in it bread has sugar

342
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:15,380
make sure to be careful with the bright flashing lights i have my main lights on this time so maybe

343
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:27,380
like balance it out maybe we'll balance it out

344
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:42,900
today i thought i was getting food poisoned when i eat because i love subways i used to get

345
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:50,900
subway sandwiches all the time i would get a subway sandwich and like not even like an hour later

346
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:56,260
i would be in riddering pain and i'd be on the the shitter just

347
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,980
but now that i know why

348
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:16,580
not that i know why uh not that i know that i'm sugar intolerant it really 100% makes sense why

349
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:22,420
subways messed me up 10 times worse than anything else

350
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:32,820
that's why i have to get like a specific bread because i know they have different types of bread

351
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:39,540
you can ask for a specific bread

352
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:50,580
or balance it with other stuff so that it doesn't make your tummy hurt all the more

353
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:56,180
can i add a garlic bread i love garlic bread is one of my favorite breads

354
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,700
um i think so

355
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,300
i eat garlic bread quite often

356
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:18,340
but not often enough so i'm not too sure because when i eat a garlic bread i'm usually probably

357
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:23,540
eating pizza on the side while i'm not sure

358
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:27,540

414
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,520
They have...

415
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,820
You know the boxes that you plug into your main outlet

416
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:22,260
and then you can plug in more things well i have three of those i have three i have three of those

417
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:36,660
and to top it all off um to top it all off the electricity running through my home isn't really

418
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:47,860
up to par

419
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:18,660
i i don't know

420
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:32,340
they want me to unplug stuff but i can't i can't i basically can't if i unplug this this

421
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:39,940
turns off that if i unplug this this turns off that if i unplug that that turns off the little fridge

422
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:45,220
with my medicine in it and then it will leak because you know that's what happens when you

423
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:58,020
unplug it for a while if i unplug that i'll be in darkness

424
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:08,820
and everything else is already off and i don't know where i don't know what cable leads to what

425
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:16,980
what cable leads to what i don't know my cable management is really bad

426
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:28,180
i don't know what i don't even know what that is i don't even know what that box is

427
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:32,580
i don't know what that is i i don't know what that is

428
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,860
what is that

429
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,980
i don't know i don't know

430
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:47,220
these are the questions we should be asking you

431
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:48,340
you

432
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:57,620
have a fire department speed up yes easy

433
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:01,700
if they make sparks and bursts

434
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:07,460
oh it'd be over a w yet i don't know

435
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:08,020
wow

436
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:19,540
a majority of the other cables are like on the other side of my room

437
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:28,420
that's connected to all their stuff that i would unplug but there's like

438
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:36,980
kind of no point unplugging it because the electricity in my home and my house is really

439
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:46,500
weird so my room is connected to my room is connected to my bathroom my living room my kitchen

440
00:58:46,500 --> 00:59:00,260
the hallway and the half half of my mom's room i'm connected to all of those rooms

441
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:06,660
so like if they're pulling power if anyone turns on anything in the living room

442
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:11,380
the power in this section of the house is gonna go out

443
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:23,220
oh my god thank you raider thank you so much for the raid thank you thank you

456
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:20,140
so i had a little i had a little okay so do you have the power box in your room no it's

457
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:25,740
it's like it's in the kitchen the power box in the kitchen you go in there and you

458
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:30,380
switch but you have to pray that it's the correct one

459
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:38,140
they used to be labeled but whoever did the electricity like when they were fixing it up

460
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:44,620
they they fucked that they like switched everything all over again

461
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,220
it was labeled but the labels are incorrect

462
01:01:55,020 --> 01:02:01,660
it's like the switch in my hallway uh do you know when you flip a switch up the light turns on

463
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:07,580
and then when you flip a switch down the light turns off well the person who came to do the

464
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:18,220
electricity turned off the power box but didn't flip the switch down so when he when they fixed it

465
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:28,300
when they fixed the light um they left the light main switch on so when you flip the switch down

466
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:36,940
the light turns on when you flip the switch up the light turns off so we have that issue

467
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:41,500
in our hallway

468
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:53,500
just the mask got it he's supposedly out there

469
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:16,780
i think my other sibling has it the best i think they're connected to

470
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:25,100
i think they're connected to the bathroom the bathroom the other half of my

471
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:36,460
my mom's room and like the middle of the middle of the hallway i think they're

472
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:44,540
connected to that so it's like only like a few outlets so they can use up a bunch of

473
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:53,740
like power in there without having issues like me but because i'm connected to the living

474
01:03:53,740 --> 01:04:00,140
room there's an ac in the living room and if someone turned that on it's over

475
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:05,900
i'm good i'm like everything's gonna turn off everything my

476
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,820
oh summer is gonna be great

477
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:31,980
but we haven't had this issue in a while so maybe not maybe not

478
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:42,380
because my ac broke i don't have one we currently the ac was taken out

479
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:49,580
and they installed a separate outlet for the ac in the living room so i think they kind of

480
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:57,340

495
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:50,700
how many electrical fires have you had one but it wasn't in this place i lived in a different place

496
01:06:54,140 --> 01:07:02,540
only one but it was a faulty a faulty like microwave i think it was the microwave

497
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:05,100
it's like a faulty microwave and it was like

498
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:13,980
and i like kind of exploded not really but it smoked it was scary

499
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:19,180
it was very loud it scared me

500
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:31,820
and then my mom swore that she'll never buy a cheap kitchen appliance ever again

501
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:44,380
i have finished translating the journal by the way yay

502
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:50,220
oh that's fast what was it what was the last time we played one time

503
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:57,100
like last week it took her a week well you were out for a while yeah

504
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:04,540
anyway it looks like this journal might be meant for azura or me

505
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:08,780
oh here it's a good look for yourself

506
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:10,380
greetings

507
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:20,060
azura you can finally read this that means you're near the tower i am

508
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:29,980
the tower is the domain of an elusive entity this being is connected to the world

509
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:36,380
for now you can think of it as the spirit of the world

510
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:47,660
all it has no physical form but it can communicate through computers and other machinery

511
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:56,940
you know who i am talking about of course when you first arrived here

512
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:05,980
they're saver savior saver saver savior and no doubt contacted you right away

513
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:10,540
there is only an entity who will guide you

514
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:19,580
there's no you who guides the both of you to the tower what did i skip three words

515
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:27,660
the entry road is at the tower's base not only do you need the sun there

516
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:32,380
but also three pieces of the previous sun

517
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:40,140
savior will not be able to do anything there

518
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:44,780
you azura on the other hand

519
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:50,700
look at the pattern on the floor do as it says

520
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:55,660
the window will be gone so you need to bring it back

521
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:08,540
is that all yeah the rest of the pages were for now i guess you don't know what happened to those

522
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:15,820
nope uh i was wondering what window was supposed to be

523
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:20,220
ah well i guess it's a little hard to figure it out

524
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:25,820
figure out that one oh but i have a good night

525
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:36,300
good night good night thanks for stopping by

526
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:39,100

527
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:56,300

528
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:12,540
ᆆᆅᅱ

529
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:40,540
Here, you can have this then.

530
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:47,540
It's not a die.

531
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:49,540
A die, sorry.

532
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:52,540
It's only one, so it's a die.

533
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:58,540
Oh, it looks like me, right?

534
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:03,540
I have a little keepsake from the library.

535
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:05,540
Thank you.

536
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:06,540
No problem.

537
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:08,540
Looks like you're all set.

538
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:10,540
I only read.

539
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:11,540
I can't read.

540
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,540
Okay.

541
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:22,540
Okay.

542
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:24,540
Good luck now.

543
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:25,540
Thanks.

544
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,540
Oh, do you need me to explain again?

545
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:33,540
Yes, please.

546
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:34,540
Alright.

547
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:36,540
Oh, I don't need an explanation.

548
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:37,540
No.

549
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:39,540
I don't know this one, but...

550
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:40,540
Oh, good.

551
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:42,540
I just wanted to see if she said anything else.

552
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:44,540
I'm smart.

553
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:45,540
I'll let me get your help.

554
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,540
Okay, now where do we go?

555
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:52,540
Is there anything else?

556
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:54,540
Is there really like anywhere else to go?

557
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:00,540
Is that it?

558
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,540
Is there anything else here?

559
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:22,540
Is the game's velocity is very relaxing?

560
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,540
Oh, that scared me.

561
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:28,540
Oh my god.

562
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:32,540
That actually scared me so bad.

563
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:38,540
Maybe I should award the heart on that monitor.

564
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:46,540
That was not me.

565
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:48,540
That was Niko.

566
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:53,540
Those Niko's tell me, not mine.

567
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:08,540
That was Niko's tell me.

568
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:12,540
Hey Azura, do you remember that cafe?

569
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:14,540
Yes.

570
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:15,540
Oh, good.

571
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,540
I'm asking because...

572
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:26,540
That's actually what my stomach sounds like, by the way.

573
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:29,540
When I get hungry, it makes that exact noise.

574
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:30,540
Isn't that weird?

575
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:31,540
Wow, funny.

576
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:41,540
Maybe even louder, and then not once, but like multiple times.

577
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:43,540
Like back to back.

578
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:47,540
Like that.

579
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:49,540
I'm a little hungry.

580
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:52,540
Actually, I'm really hungry.

581
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:54,540
I don't eat anything since I got here.

582
01:14:55,540 --> 01:15:01,540
So, it's okay if we go get some food before we enter the tower.

583
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,540
I was going to say eat the tower.

584
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,540
Oh my god.

585
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:08,540
I love pancakes.

586
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:10,540
Oh, pancakes.

587
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:13,540
Let's go.

588
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:15,540
Let's go.

589
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:16,540
Let's go get a pancake.

590
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:20,540
Pancake, pancake, pancake, pancake, pancake.

591
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:23,540
He needs some milk.

592
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:25,540
Oh, we gotta go get some milk.

593
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:30,540
Pancake, pancake, pancake, pancake.

594
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:34,540
Pancake, pancake, pancake, pancake.

595
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:38,540
Pancake, pancake, pancake, pancake.

596
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,540
Let's order the baguettes.

597
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:44,540

I dont know why I should not be here.

01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,720
I just wanna see my mother again.

01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:44,720
Oh, oh, they're there.

It's gonna be okay.

721
01:23:51,720 --> 01:24:00,720
It's gonna be okay, baby. It's okay, baby. Don't worry. Everything's gonna be just okay.

722
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:09,720
You'll find your mama. You'll meet her again.

723
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:18,720
And I'm sure you'll be able to save the world. You're a tough kid. You managed to get this far already, right?

724
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:26,720
Yeah, I'll fuck it. And you'll get to go home afterwards, right?

725
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:32,720
Right? It's okay, baby.

A. Want some more pancakes?

727
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:43,720
It's okay. It'll be fine.

Oh yeah, so yeah, thanks for coming by. Thanks for listening.

729
01:24:54,720 --> 01:25:02,720
I like the person behind the cooking person, the person that makes the food.

730
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:09,720
I like them because they make food and they make pancakes and they comfort the baby for me.

733
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:22,720
No problem. Good luck.

734
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:27,720
Thanks. Oh, pancakes.

735
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:32,720

It's okay. I don't need it.

01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:57,720
I got this. Oh, since I'm up here, I can do this now, yeah?

740
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,720
Since I'm up here, might as well.

741

01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:52,420

Congratulations, you are now inside the tower.

989
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,400
Are you talking to me?

990
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:22,400
Well, correct.

991
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,400
But you're always talking to Azura before.

992
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:27,400
Where is...?

993
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:29,400
Azura has already left.

994
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:32,400
I had to resort to contacting you directly.

995
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:36,400
Wait, so Azura is gone?

996
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,400
Just like that?

997
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:39,400
Correct.

998
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:41,400
I'm still here!

999
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:47,400
Don't lie to Niko, you lying computer!

1000
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:52,400
We're good, correct?

1001
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:55,400
Azura has already finished their mission.

1002
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:59,400
And so, have you, Niko, here?

1003
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:02,400
Rest now.

1004
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:05,400
Please, that's happening.

1005
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:07,400
It's like a bad dream.

1006
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:10,400
You wake up, you'll be home.

1007
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:15,400
Oh, but what's wrong?

1008
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:20,400
I thought there would be more to it, you know?

1009
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:24,400
I thought we were supposed to go to the top of the tower.

1010
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:29,400
I thought there was supposed to be somewhere we need to put the sun.

1011

And now, I don't even have the sun anymore.

1012
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:40,400
Azura is just gone.

1013
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,400
This feels wrong.

1014
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,400
But you did good.

1015
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,400
You saved the world, Niko.

1016
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:49,400
Are you not happy?

1017
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:55,400
I guess I am.

1018
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:58,400
But it's just...

1019
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,400
Oh.

1020
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:13,400
Is this really it?

1021
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:16,400
Is that it?

1022
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:23,400
Neri, I'm glad to say goodbye to Azura.

1023
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:27,400
Oh baby boy, I'm so sorry.

1024
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,400
Oh.

1025
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:41,400
As for me, what I do?

1026
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:44,400
What I do?

1027
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:48,400
As for you, Azura?

1028
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:50,400
Yeah?

1029
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:53,400
Yeah?

1030
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:56,400
What's up?

1031
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:58,400
We're done here.

1032
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:01,400
Done here? What do you mean? We're done here.

1033
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:04,400
Please don't return to this world anymore.

1034
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,400
What the fuck?

1035
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:12,400
What do you mean?

1036
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:14,400
What just happened?

1037
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,400
Thank you.

1038
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:29,400
Thank you.

1039
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:31,400
What the fuck?

1040
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:57,400
They can't close.

1041
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:03,400
What the fuck?

1042
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:09,400
Wait.

1043
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:19,400
No, I don't want to give up.

1044
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:22,400
I want to help Niko.

1045
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:26,400
What's that?

1046
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:44,400
Only you can do something.

1047
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,400
Well, how's if I...

1048
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:48,400
What can I do?

1049
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,400
What can I do?

1050
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:53,400
What can I do?

1051
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:58,400
How do I beat the evil computer person?

1052
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:05,400
I think I'll uninstall the game or reinstall it.

1053
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:14,400
Task manager?

1054
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:22,400
What the fuck?

1055
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,400
What the fuck?

1056
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:39,400
Is there anything new in here?

1057
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:42,400
Not really.

1058
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:45,400
No, there's nothing new in here.

1059
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:53,400
Let me check elsewhere.

1060
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:40,400
Oh my god, I thought that said program but plug, but it said program bug check.

1061
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:54,400
What the fuck?

1062
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:30,400
I'm so confused.

1063
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:33,400
I'm so confused.

1064
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:37,400
Ever read?

1065
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:40,400
What's on my mind?

1066
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:43,400
Save Niko.

1067
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:48,400
Save Niko is on my mind right now.

1068
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:04,400
So look elsewhere?

1069
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:07,400
Where else would you look?

1070
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:10,400
On my desktop?

1071
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:13,400
Got minimize stuff, hang on.

1072
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:21,400
Oh, what's this?

1073
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:24,400
Oh no, that's not anything new.

1074
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:27,400
I know what that is.

1075
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:34,400
It knows nothing on my desktop.

1076
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:37,400
How strange.

1077
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:43,400
What am I looking for?

1078
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:05,400
I'm looking for something that's a hint.

1079
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:07,400
What is that?

1080
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:12,400
Tell a dildon?

1081
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:15,400
What?

1082
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:39,400
What is this?

1083
01:58:39,400 --> 01:58:43,400
There's more than one way to open the game?

1084
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:47,400
Oh, well an administrator.

1085
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:54,400
How's what you open the game?

1086
01:58:54,400 --> 01:59:01,400
Put an administrator from the file itself.

1087
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:23,400
There's a bolder.

1088
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:25,400
Yeah, there's a couple of files here.

1089
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:30,400
There's this one and then this one.

1090
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:37,400
Can't, could not initialize.

1091
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:50,400
Do I delete one?

1092
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:55,400
We've got another thing to open.

1093
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:01,400
This one.

1094
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:22,400
Yeah, I have it open.

1095
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:25,400
What about it?

1096
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:30,400
I have it open right now.

1097
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:34,400
Is it supposed to do anything?

1098
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:55,400
Oh shit.

1099
02:00:55,400 --> 02:01:00,400
That actually scared me.

1100
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:08,400
Are we saving Niko?

1101
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:19,400
Niko.

1102
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:31,400
Hello?

1103
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:33,400
Azura?

1104
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:36,400
Was that you just now?

1105
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:39,400
I thought I heard your voice.

1106
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:45,400
We back, we did it!

1107
02:01:45,400 --> 02:02:07,400
I almost already missed it.

1108
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:09,400
I'm saving the world.

1109
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:14,400
Yeah, save the world!

1110
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:22,400
I'm in a dream.

1111
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:30,400
Ah, I guess you're still not there.

1112
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:33,400
There's something in my pocket.

1113
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:35,400
I don't remember what I got there.

1114
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:43,400
Oh yeah, oh.

1115
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:47,400
A computer's on again.

1116
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:50,400
You're still here.

1117
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:59,400
Niko, why are you still here?

1118
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:02,400
Oh god, it's angry at me!

1119
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:06,400
The computer's angry!

1120
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:09,400
It's angry at me!

1121
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:12,400
It's angry!

1122
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:17,400
You said you.

1123
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:21,400
Why did you come back Azura?

1124
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:26,400
I told you to stay away!

1125
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:29,400
You knew.

1126
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:32,400
I tried to cut the story short.

1127
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:36,400
Is that it?

1128
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:39,400
You want more out of me?

1129
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:41,400
Is that it?

1130
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:45,400
Fine.

1131
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:47,400
You don't want to leave?

1132
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:51,400
I'll make sure you never do.

1133
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:58,400
Eh?

1134
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:00,400
What's going on?

1135
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:02,400
I'm scared.

1136
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:20,400
See?

1137
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:24,400
Oh, this is how you do this!

1138
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:28,400
I got it! I got it! I'm smart! I'm smart!

1139
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:31,400
I got this! Wait, hang on.

1140
02:04:31,400 --> 02:04:33,400
And then...

1141
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:40,400
Wait.

1142
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,400
Hang on.

1143
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:44,400
Wait, I'm smart. Hang on, I'm cooking.

1144
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:49,400
Hang on, hang on.

1145
02:04:50,400 --> 02:05:02,400
Eh?

1146
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:05,400
Oh, I didn't even read it. Something happened.

1147
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:10,400
It said something on the first one. I didn't read it.

1148
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:14,400
I didn't read it. I didn't read it.

1149
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:16,400
Oh, no.

1150
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:19,400
Oh!

1151
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:24,400
It said, back then, I told you about the entity.

1152
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:30,400
As little as possible.

1153
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:35,400
And then it says...

1154
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:37,400
Apologies for that.

1155
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:41,400
I did not want to put the library in a danger.

1156
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:46,400
And then we go this way.

1157
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:49,400
And then, I did.

1158
02:05:49,400 --> 02:05:52,400
I did.

1159
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:55,400
I did.

1160
02:05:55,400 --> 02:06:00,400
This being has a habit of silencing the people

1161
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:04,400
to learn of its true nature.

1162
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:08,400
And we just keep going this way.

1163
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:17,400
Hang on, hang on.

1164
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:20,400
I can't read sideways.

1165
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:28,400
Regrettably, I have seen it happen to dear friends.

1166
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:32,400
That's what's up.

1167
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:35,400
Let's play.

1168
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:59,400
I do not worry. The entity cannot touch you.

1169
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:05,400
We go back this way.

1170
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:15,400
Nor can it do anything to me.

1171
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:25,400
Okay, back this way, back this way.

1172
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:32,400
I already left the world on my own terms.

1173
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:36,400
Hang on this way.

1174
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:46,400
Oh.

1175
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:58,400
I never meant for the entity to exist.

1176
02:07:58,400 --> 02:08:04,400
But now that it is fully sentient,

1177
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:14,400
one thing became clear.

1178
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:23,400
The entity seeks death.

1179
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:25,400
Where?

1180
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:37,400
So.

1181
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:43,400
Death to itself, death to the world.

1182
02:08:43,400 --> 02:08:51,400
A relentless desire that manifested physically.

1183
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:58,400
So.

1184
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:02,400
You have already seen the scars.

1185
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:10,400
Yeah.

1186
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:16,400
Right now, the entity is doing everything it can

1187
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:22,400
to impede your progress.

1188
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:28,400
Stalling for even a few minutes.

1189
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:37,400
I think it was this one.

1190
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:56,400
Before you inevitably bring the sun to the tower summit.

1191
02:09:56,400 --> 02:10:01,400
This is so much work.

1192
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:05,400
So much work.

1193
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:26,400
That is where you, God, will make the final judgment for the world.

1194
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:43,400
Of course, the entity will contact you again there.

1195
02:10:43,400 --> 02:11:12,400
And when it does, it will trick you into shattering the sun.

1196
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:28,400
This will end the world instantly.

1197
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:41,400
Wait, what just happened? Did I go to the wrong door?

1198
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:44,400
Oh, I think I went to the wrong door.

1199
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:54,400
No? Or is it just silence?

1200
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:56,400
Okay, this is scaring me.

1201
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:58,400
No, no.

1202
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:10,400
It is not that simple.

1203
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:12,400
I'm sorry.

1204
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:17,400
I do not know what to do in a situation like this.

1205
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:24,400
I, I'm, what's happening?

1206
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:42,400
But I think I have to tell you the truth.

1207
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:49,400
The sun is the Messiah's tide to the world.

1208
02:12:49,400 --> 02:13:14,400
Oh, no. I'm not going to remember that.

1209
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:15,400
Where'd it go?

1210
02:13:15,400 --> 02:13:18,400
Hey, come back!

1211
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:20,400
Where are you?

1212
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:24,400
If only you guys could see what I have to freaking do.

1213
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:35,400
What I have to do?

1214
02:13:35,400 --> 02:14:00,400
As long as the sun is intact, the Messiah remains trapped here.

1215
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:05,400
Yeah, here.

1216
02:14:05,400 --> 02:14:24,400
And then all the way down, this side, this side, this side, this side.

1217
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:28,400
Bad hurry.

1218
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:53,400
It remains trapped here.

1219
02:14:53,400 --> 02:15:04,400
What do I do?

1220
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:33,400
What do I do wrong?

1221
02:15:33,400 --> 02:15:52,400
Is it the opposite way?

1222
02:15:52,400 --> 02:16:17,400
I don't think so.

1223
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:23,400
No. What?

1224
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:46,400
I don't get it.

1225
02:16:46,400 --> 02:17:13,400
I don't get it.

1226
02:17:13,400 --> 02:17:18,400
I don't understand.

1227
02:17:18,400 --> 02:17:41,400
Is it like a specific way?

1228
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:43,400
I am not good with puzzles.

1229
02:17:43,400 --> 02:17:58,400
I think you guys already figured out that I'm horrendously bad with puzzles.

1230
02:17:58,400 --> 02:18:02,400
Yeah, it's making a shape.

1231
02:18:02,400 --> 02:18:22,400
But this is the shape. It looks like this.

1232
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:26,400
This is the shape it's making.

1233
02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:34,400
It stops there.

1234
02:18:34,400 --> 02:18:36,400
Oh! Oh my gosh!

1235
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:46,400
I can hang on. I think I got it.

1236
02:18:46,400 --> 02:19:07,400
My shoulder just popped. I felt so good.

1237
02:19:07,400 --> 02:19:32,400
Shattering the sun may terminate this world, but...

1238
02:19:32,400 --> 02:19:40,400
How can I make everything big?

1239
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:50,400
How am I supposed to find that?

1240
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:59,400
There's no way I'm going to find that.

1241
02:19:59,400 --> 02:20:14,400
Okay, I got this.

1242
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:22,400
Okay, so first...

1243
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:27,400
Oh shit. Like that.

1244
02:20:27,400 --> 02:20:29,400
Let's go!

1245
02:20:29,400 --> 02:20:33,400
I'm amazing.

1246
02:20:33,400 --> 02:20:44,400
My memory is so bad, but I did it.

1247
02:20:44,400 --> 02:20:46,400
Oh shit.

1248
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:48,400
Oh shit.

1249
02:20:48,400 --> 02:20:50,400
I spoke too soon.

1250
02:20:50,400 --> 02:20:52,400
They gave me something much harder.

1251
02:20:52,400 --> 02:20:54,400
Oh my god.

1252
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:56,400
I see.

1253
02:20:56,400 --> 02:20:59,400
This is a test all along.

1254
02:20:59,400 --> 02:21:02,400
Oh, they don't like me.

1255
02:21:02,400 --> 02:21:09,400
Oh, they don't like me at all.

1256
02:21:09,400 --> 02:21:11,400
I didn't read the last letter, did I?

1257
02:21:11,400 --> 02:21:12,400
I think I did.

1258
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:14,400
Something about shattering.

1259
02:21:14,400 --> 02:21:20,400
It is also the only way for the Messiah to return home.

1260
02:21:20,400 --> 02:21:44,400
Okay, oh, there you go.

1261
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:47,400
Okay, let's start.

1262
02:21:47,400 --> 02:21:49,400
Let's start here.

1263
02:22:14,400 --> 02:22:16,400
Okay.

1264
02:22:16,400 --> 02:22:22,400
And then...

1265
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:24,400
Oh shit.

1266
02:22:24,400 --> 02:22:26,400
Why is there a bug?

1267
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:32,400
You know, crazy.

1268
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:38,400
There you go.

1269
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:40,400
Okay.

1270
02:22:40,400 --> 02:22:56,400
I feel like I'm cooking very slowly.

1271
02:22:56,400 --> 02:23:04,400
Okay.

1272
02:23:04,400 --> 02:23:14,400
Okay.

1273
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:24,400
Okay.

1274
02:23:24,400 --> 02:23:46,400
Okay.

1275
02:23:46,400 --> 02:24:08,400
And then...

1276
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:28,400
Shit, shit.

1277
02:24:28,400 --> 02:24:48,400
Oh shit.

1278
02:24:48,400 --> 02:25:16,400
Okay.

1279
02:25:16,400 --> 02:25:18,400
I'm doing this.

1280
02:25:18,400 --> 02:25:20,400
I'm doing this.

1281
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:22,400
I'm doing it.

1282
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:24,400
Okay.

1283
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:26,400
I'm doing it.

1284
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:28,400
I'm doing it.

1285
02:25:28,400 --> 02:25:32,400
Oh shit.

1286
02:25:32,400 --> 02:25:34,400
Okay.

1287
02:25:34,400 --> 02:25:38,400
This is here.

1288
02:25:38,400 --> 02:25:48,400
Here.

1289
02:25:48,400 --> 02:25:56,400
Here.

1290
02:25:56,400 --> 02:25:58,400
Okay, can I leave?

1291
02:25:58,400 --> 02:26:24,400
I missed a spot.

1292
02:26:24,400 --> 02:26:52,400
Okay.

1293
02:26:52,400 --> 02:27:00,400
I did it.

1294
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:10,400
I did it.

1295
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:14,400
I did not realize things could end up like this.

1296
02:27:14,400 --> 02:27:18,400
Please forgive me.

1297
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:30,400
Okay.

1298
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:34,400
There's a light bulb.

1299
02:27:34,400 --> 02:27:38,400
I guess it's here.

1300
02:27:38,400 --> 02:27:46,400
I don't know why.

1301
02:27:46,400 --> 02:27:50,400
Where is it coming from?

1302
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:52,400
There you go.

1303
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:54,400
I'm here.

1304
02:27:54,400 --> 02:27:56,400
I'm here baby.

1305
02:27:56,400 --> 02:28:00,400
Yay.

1306
02:28:00,400 --> 02:28:02,400
Yeah.

1307
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:04,400
Is that really you?

1308
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:10,400
I thought you were gone.

1309
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:14,400
I never loved you.

1310
02:28:14,400 --> 02:28:18,400
I was really a bit scared back there.

1311
02:28:18,400 --> 02:28:22,400
I thought I was completely alone.

1312
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:24,400
That was silly of me to assume, wasn't it?

1313
02:28:24,400 --> 02:28:26,400
No baby, it wasn't.

1314
02:28:26,400 --> 02:28:32,400
I guess we need to figure out where to go now.

1315
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:36,400
What is that?

1316
02:28:36,400 --> 02:28:38,400
A song.

1317
02:28:38,400 --> 02:28:50,400
Is that on a song?

1318
02:28:50,400 --> 02:28:52,400
I guess we should pick it up.

1319
02:28:52,400 --> 02:29:00,400
Right Azura?

1320
02:29:00,400 --> 02:29:10,400
Everything's so small.

1321
02:29:10,400 --> 02:29:24,400
I think it screams out by accident.

1322
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:36,400
There again?

1323
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:40,400
It's all neatly stacked.

1324
02:29:40,400 --> 02:29:42,400
It's all cleaned up.

1325
02:29:42,400 --> 02:29:50,400
It's not broken the last time.

1326
02:29:50,400 --> 02:29:54,400
There's nothing in the fridge.

1327
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:56,400
Did you hear that?

1328
02:29:56,400 --> 02:30:00,400
Was it the first closing?

1329
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:02,400
It was.

1330
02:30:02,400 --> 02:30:08,400
I got a little spooked.

1331
02:30:08,400 --> 02:30:18,400
Wait, what's in here?

1332
02:30:18,400 --> 02:30:22,400
I had a friend at home.

1333
02:30:22,400 --> 02:30:46,400
I had a friend at home, what does that mean?

1334
02:30:46,400 --> 02:30:50,400
I don't know where the light is coming from.

1335
02:30:50,400 --> 02:30:58,400
We'll turn it on.

1336
02:30:58,400 --> 02:31:00,400
A little tree.

1337
02:31:00,400 --> 02:31:02,400
It's a mirror.

1338
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:04,400
It's a toilet.

1339
02:31:04,400 --> 02:31:24,400
I don't know.

1340
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:30,400
So, you actually made it here.

1341
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:36,400
I guess you're in Azura.

1342
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:42,400
I'll tell you how to save the world then.

1343
02:31:42,400 --> 02:31:46,400
You reached the summit.

1344
02:31:46,400 --> 02:32:10,400
Shattered the lightbulb.

1345
02:32:10,400 --> 02:32:16,400
I'm just humoring you.

1346
02:32:16,400 --> 02:32:24,400
I know you've been getting help from a certain someone.

1347
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:32,400
This computer is scary.

1348
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:38,400
He didn't already told you about the choice.

1349
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:44,400
Baby?

1350
02:32:44,400 --> 02:32:50,400
Are you still planning to save the world, Azura?

1351
02:32:50,400 --> 02:32:54,400
Why are you trying so hard for this?

1352
02:32:54,400 --> 02:33:04,400
Haven't you even figured out what this world is?

1353
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:10,400
I told you at the beginning, your mission is to help Niko leave.

1354
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:14,400
Because Niko isn't part of this world.

1355
02:33:14,400 --> 02:33:22,400
Niko is the only thing worth saving here.

1356
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:26,400
The final choice is up to you.

1357
02:33:26,400 --> 02:33:34,400
I can't go against my programming.

1358
02:33:34,400 --> 02:33:40,400
You only have one shot, Azura.

1359
02:33:40,400 --> 02:33:48,400
If you choose to smash the lightbulb, then Niko wakes back up.

1360
02:33:48,400 --> 02:33:54,400
Back home, like it was all a dream.

1361
02:33:54,400 --> 02:33:58,400
Niko returns the sun.

1362
02:33:58,400 --> 02:34:08,400
The child will have to bear the weight of this sacrifice.

1363
02:34:08,400 --> 02:34:14,400
At least, tell Niko the truth.

1364
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:22,400
You don't care about Niko, do you?

1365
02:34:22,400 --> 02:34:32,400
I don't care about Niko.

1366
02:34:32,400 --> 02:34:42,400
I don't care about Niko.

1367
02:34:42,400 --> 02:34:48,400
I don't care about Niko.

1368
02:34:48,400 --> 02:35:00,400
I'm sure it's taking a while.

1369
02:35:00,400 --> 02:35:12,400
I guess this elevator leads to the top of the tower, Azura.

1370
02:35:12,400 --> 02:35:16,400
Are you excited, Azura?

1371
02:35:16,400 --> 02:35:20,400
Or are you finally going to say bye now?

1372
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:24,400
I know it's the realest time.

1373
02:35:24,400 --> 02:35:28,400
What is there here?

1374
02:35:28,400 --> 02:35:32,400
And then...

1375
02:35:32,400 --> 02:35:36,400
I have to go home for real this time, too.

1376
02:35:36,400 --> 02:35:40,400
I can't wait to see everyone again.

1377
02:35:40,400 --> 02:35:44,400
Are you okay, Azura?

1378
02:35:44,400 --> 02:35:50,400
I don't know.

1379
02:35:50,400 --> 02:36:00,400
I don't know.

1380
02:36:00,400 --> 02:36:04,400
I don't know.

1381
02:36:04,400 --> 02:36:10,400
I don't know.

1382
02:36:10,400 --> 02:36:16,400
I don't know.

1383
02:36:40,400 --> 02:36:50,400
I don't know.

1384
02:36:50,400 --> 02:37:00,400
I don't know.

1385
02:37:00,400 --> 02:37:08,400
I don't know.

1386
02:37:08,400 --> 02:37:18,400
I don't know.

1387
02:37:18,400 --> 02:37:28,400
I don't know.

1388
02:37:28,400 --> 02:37:38,400
I don't know.

1389
02:37:38,400 --> 02:37:48,400
I don't know.

1390
02:37:48,400 --> 02:37:56,400
I don't know.

1391
02:37:56,400 --> 02:38:06,400
I don't know.

1392
02:38:06,400 --> 02:38:16,400
I don't know.

1393
02:38:16,400 --> 02:38:24,400
I don't know.

1394
02:38:24,400 --> 02:38:34,400
I don't know.

1395
02:38:34,400 --> 02:38:44,400
I don't know.

1396
02:38:44,400 --> 02:38:52,400
I don't know.

1397
02:38:52,400 --> 02:39:02,400
I don't know.

1398
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:12,400
I don't know.

1399
02:39:12,400 --> 02:39:20,400
I don't know.

1400
02:39:20,400 --> 02:39:30,400
I don't know.

1401
02:39:30,400 --> 02:39:40,400
I don't know.

1402
02:39:40,400 --> 02:39:48,400
I don't know.

1403
02:39:48,400 --> 02:39:58,400
I don't know.

1404
02:39:58,400 --> 02:40:08,400
I don't know.

1405
02:40:08,400 --> 02:40:18,400
I don't know.

1406
02:40:18,400 --> 02:40:28,400
I don't know.

1407
02:40:28,400 --> 02:40:36,400
I don't know.

1408
02:40:36,400 --> 02:40:46,400
I don't know.

1409
02:40:46,400 --> 02:40:56,400
I don't know.

1410
02:40:56,400 --> 02:41:06,400
I don't know.

1411
02:41:06,400 --> 02:41:16,400
I don't know.

1412
02:41:16,400 --> 02:41:26,400
I don't know.

1413
02:41:26,400 --> 02:41:36,400
I don't know.

1414
02:41:36,400 --> 02:41:46,400
I don't know.

1415
02:41:46,400 --> 02:41:56,400
I don't know.

1416
02:41:56,400 --> 02:42:06,400
I don't know.

1417
02:42:06,400 --> 02:42:34,400
I don't know.

1418
02:42:34,400 --> 02:43:02,400
I don't know.

1419
02:43:02,400 --> 02:43:12,400
I don't know.

1420
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:22,400
I don't know.

1421
02:43:22,400 --> 02:43:42,400
I don't know.

1422
02:43:42,400 --> 02:44:02,400
I don't know.

1423
02:44:02,400 --> 02:44:30,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1424
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:58,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1425
02:44:58,400 --> 02:45:18,400
I don't want to save the world.

1426
02:45:18,400 --> 02:45:26,400
I don't want to save the world.

1427
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:36,400
I don't want the world.

1428
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:46,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1429
02:45:46,400 --> 02:45:56,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1430
02:45:56,400 --> 02:46:06,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1431
02:46:06,400 --> 02:46:32,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1432
02:46:32,400 --> 02:46:52,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1433
02:46:52,400 --> 02:47:12,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1434
02:47:12,400 --> 02:47:32,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1435
02:47:32,400 --> 02:47:52,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1436
02:47:52,400 --> 02:48:02,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1437
02:48:02,400 --> 02:48:12,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1438
02:48:12,400 --> 02:48:22,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1439
02:48:22,400 --> 02:48:32,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1440
02:48:32,400 --> 02:49:00,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1441
02:49:00,400 --> 02:49:10,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1442
02:49:10,400 --> 02:49:20,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1443
02:49:20,400 --> 02:49:28,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1444
02:49:28,400 --> 02:49:38,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1445
02:49:38,400 --> 02:49:48,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1446
02:49:48,400 --> 02:49:58,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1447
02:49:58,400 --> 02:50:08,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1448
02:50:08,400 --> 02:50:18,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1449
02:50:18,400 --> 02:50:28,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1450
02:50:28,400 --> 02:50:48,400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

1451
02:50:48,400 --> 02:51:16,400
Hang on, hang on, hang on. What's this?

1452
02:51:16,400 --> 02:51:36,400
I like tilted my head so hard that my whole neck thick.

1453
02:51:36,400 --> 02:51:46,400
Wait, what do I do?

1454
02:51:46,400 --> 02:52:14,400
Don't worry, give me one second.

1455
02:52:14,400 --> 02:52:24,400
Hmm?

1456
02:52:44,400 --> 02:53:04,400
Wait, is it in here?

1457
02:53:04,400 --> 02:53:14,400
Import, no, that's not what that is.

1458
02:53:14,400 --> 02:53:34,400
No, no, no, no.

1459
02:53:34,400 --> 02:53:44,400
Hang on, hang on.

1460
02:53:44,400 --> 02:53:54,400
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

1461
02:53:54,400 --> 02:54:04,400
Hang on, hang on.

1462
02:54:04,400 --> 02:54:24,400
I just got an achievement.

1463
02:54:24,400 --> 02:54:32,400
What did I do?

1464
02:54:32,400 --> 02:54:42,400
Wait, what just happened?

1465
02:54:42,400 --> 02:54:50,400
Hello?

1466
02:54:50,400 --> 02:55:06,400
I thought we started over.

1467
02:55:06,400 --> 02:55:14,400
What did I do?

1468
02:55:14,400 --> 02:55:18,400
Say that word, sir.

1469
02:55:18,400 --> 02:55:42,400
Why does it sound so familiar?

1470
02:55:42,400 --> 02:55:52,400
Okay, all right, give me a second.

1471
02:55:52,400 --> 02:56:04,400
Okay, all right.

1472
02:56:04,400 --> 02:56:30,400
Okay, cool, that's cool.

1473
02:56:30,400 --> 02:56:40,400
Hi, what's this?

1474
02:56:40,400 --> 02:56:46,400
What are you doing in here? You shouldn't be in there. Why are you in there?

1475
02:56:46,400 --> 02:56:52,400
It looks like you were able to remove the restriction.

1476
02:56:52,400 --> 02:57:02,400
In that case, you are ready to continue. The necessary preparations are already in place.

1477
02:57:02,400 --> 02:57:10,400
This is a night run, very different or depending on your actions.

1478
02:57:10,400 --> 02:57:18,400
If you can recognize my symbol, you'll know what you should do.

1479
02:57:18,400 --> 02:57:26,400
I confess, it will be risky.

1480
02:57:26,400 --> 02:57:36,400
The probability that the entity is conditioned or worsened is quite high.

1481
02:57:36,400 --> 02:57:52,400
And if that happens, then the hints are here.

1482
02:57:52,400 --> 02:57:58,400
Hang on.

1483
02:57:58,400 --> 02:58:10,400
Look at me, asking you for favors only to become so apprehensive once you agree.

1484
02:58:10,400 --> 02:58:16,400
I understand if you wish to leave some questions unanswered.

1485
02:58:16,400 --> 02:58:22,400
I understand if you do not believe in a happy resolution.

1486
02:58:22,400 --> 02:58:30,400
I understand if you are simply afraid of all my habit.

1487
02:58:30,400 --> 02:58:36,400
Because I am afraid too.

1488
02:58:36,400 --> 02:58:48,400
No one.

1489
02:58:48,400 --> 02:59:02,400
If you enjoy the world as it is, if you are satisfied with the story as it is,

1490
02:59:02,400 --> 02:59:16,400
if you really do not want to see anything change or better or worse, then pretend you never saw this.

1491
02:59:16,400 --> 02:59:22,400
Carry the session as you normally would.

1492
02:59:22,400 --> 02:59:30,400
Do not use my journal or anything other than what you are already familiar with.

1493
02:59:30,400 --> 02:59:38,400
This option will always remain for you though.

1494
02:59:38,400 --> 03:00:06,400
That's why I implore you to consider the Messiah,

1495
03:00:06,400 --> 03:00:12,400
the world, my children.

1496
03:00:12,400 --> 03:00:18,400
They all deserve their good ending.

1497
03:00:18,400 --> 03:00:24,400
Thank you for listening. Goodbye.

1498
03:00:24,400 --> 03:00:32,400
Is the person who sent us the letters the actual God of this world?

1499
03:00:32,400 --> 03:00:40,400
See me.

1500
03:00:40,400 --> 03:00:48,400
Solstice.

1501
03:00:48,400 --> 03:00:58,400
Access granted.

1502
03:00:58,400 --> 03:01:22,400
Thank you.

1503
03:01:22,400 --> 03:01:26,400
Hi.

1504
03:01:26,400 --> 03:01:30,400
Hi.

1505
03:01:30,400 --> 03:01:34,400
You found me.

1506
03:01:34,400 --> 03:01:36,400
Why?

1507
03:01:36,400 --> 03:01:40,400
You are ready to leave. Not much of the world remains.

1508
03:01:40,400 --> 03:01:44,400
This will be apparent when she goes outside.

1509
03:01:44,400 --> 03:01:50,400
This place was never worth saving. Do you still want to try?

1510
03:01:50,400 --> 03:01:54,400
Do you remember this? Your actions will affect you.

1511
03:01:54,400 --> 03:01:56,400
Your mission.

1512
03:01:56,400 --> 03:01:58,400
Your style will make you leave.

1513
03:01:58,400 --> 03:02:02,400
And most importantly...

1514
03:02:02,400 --> 03:02:06,400
No.

1515
03:02:06,400 --> 03:02:14,400
This does not feel right at all. Have we already been through this?

1516
03:02:14,400 --> 03:02:22,400
But that should be impossible. You only had one shot.

1517
03:02:22,400 --> 03:02:30,400
I wasn't supposed to exist after that.

1518
03:02:30,400 --> 03:02:34,400
Here is the sound of a door locking.

1519
03:02:34,400 --> 03:02:40,400
Azura? That sounds so familiar.

1520
03:02:40,400 --> 03:02:44,400
I'll turn it on.

1521
03:02:44,400 --> 03:02:50,400
Dusty books. So dark are you here.

1522
03:02:50,400 --> 03:02:54,400
Weather, plants, it's here.

1523
03:02:54,400 --> 03:03:10,400
I'm going to see a little eyeball.

1524
03:03:10,400 --> 03:03:22,400
Hello? Hello? Anyone?

1525
03:03:22,400 --> 03:03:30,400
How did we do this again?

1526
03:03:30,400 --> 03:03:36,400
Do we have to do everything all over again?

1527
03:03:36,400 --> 03:03:40,400
Where did we go?

1528
03:03:40,400 --> 03:03:50,400
What did we do again?

1529
03:03:50,400 --> 03:03:58,400
What did we do again?

1530
03:03:58,400 --> 03:04:06,400
What did we do again?

1531
03:04:06,400 --> 03:04:16,400
What did we do again?

1532
03:04:16,400 --> 03:04:26,400
What did we do again?

1533
03:04:26,400 --> 03:04:36,400
What did we do again?

1534
03:04:36,400 --> 03:04:46,400
What did we do again?

1535
03:04:46,400 --> 03:05:04,400
What did we do again?

1536
03:05:04,400 --> 03:05:14,400
What did we do again?

1537
03:05:14,400 --> 03:05:24,400
What did we do again?

1538
03:05:24,400 --> 03:05:34,400
What did we do?

1539
03:05:34,400 --> 03:05:44,400
What did we do again?

1540
03:05:44,400 --> 03:06:00,400
What did we do again?

1541
03:06:00,400 --> 03:06:20,400
What did we do again?

1542
03:06:20,400 --> 03:06:28,400
My eyes.

1543
03:06:28,400 --> 03:06:42,400
My eyes.

1544
03:06:42,400 --> 03:06:52,400
What did we do again?

1545
03:06:52,400 --> 03:07:02,400
What did we do again?

1546
03:07:02,400 --> 03:07:12,400
What did we do again?

1547
03:07:12,400 --> 03:07:22,400
What did we do again?

1548
03:07:22,400 --> 03:07:32,400
Okay, it's over.

1549
03:07:32,400 --> 03:07:42,400
There's no bud here.

1550
03:07:52,400 --> 03:08:02,400
How are you?

1551
03:08:02,400 --> 03:08:12,400
How are you?

1552
03:08:12,400 --> 03:08:22,400
What am I supposed to be looking for?

1553
03:08:22,400 --> 03:08:32,400
The light bulb, you are here.

1554
03:08:32,400 --> 03:08:42,400
I am the most humbled by your presence.

1555
03:08:42,400 --> 03:08:52,400
I am sorry, it triggered my theory.

1556
03:08:52,400 --> 03:09:20,400
I am sorry, it triggered my theory.

1557
03:09:20,400 --> 03:09:30,400
I like how my Siri responds.

1558
03:09:30,400 --> 03:09:40,400
What is it?

1559
03:09:40,400 --> 03:09:52,400
Is anyone else's Siri does that?

1560
03:09:52,400 --> 03:09:56,400
They have such a peppy tone in their voice. I like it.

1561
03:09:56,400 --> 03:10:06,400
I didn't used to do that before.

1562
03:10:06,400 --> 03:10:26,400
I am an android peasant.

1563
03:10:26,400 --> 03:10:32,400
I used to be an android peasant too.

1564
03:10:32,400 --> 03:10:38,400
But a lot of jobs that I worked at required that I had an iPhone.

1565
03:10:38,400 --> 03:10:42,400
I had no choice.

1566
03:10:42,400 --> 03:10:56,400
I had no other choice but to switch to the dock side.

1567
03:10:56,400 --> 03:11:08,400
I remember the old Australian English female PA working for a bookstore team.

1568
03:11:08,400 --> 03:11:30,400
All extra in the trenches, prepaid foam. Crazy.

1569
03:11:30,400 --> 03:11:42,400
We went so far back in time. I feel old now after you said that.

1570
03:11:42,400 --> 03:11:58,400
He has a burner.

1571
03:11:58,400 --> 03:12:08,400
I woke up in this new house. It was really dark.

1572
03:12:08,400 --> 03:12:24,400
I will not fight him.

1573
03:12:24,400 --> 03:12:40,400
I woke up in this house.

1574
03:12:40,400 --> 03:12:50,400
I remember something about that.

1575
03:12:50,400 --> 03:13:00,400
My brain is weak. Give me one second.

1576
03:13:00,400 --> 03:13:02,400
You do?

1577
03:13:02,400 --> 03:13:18,400
How was the one who was supposed to inform you of that?

1578
03:13:18,400 --> 03:13:34,400
I don't know.

1579
03:13:34,400 --> 03:13:54,400
I don't know who you are.

1580
03:13:54,400 --> 03:14:14,400
I don't know who you are.

1581
03:14:14,400 --> 03:14:34,400
I don't know who you are.

1582
03:14:34,400 --> 03:14:54,400
I don't know who you are.

1583
03:14:54,400 --> 03:15:14,400
I don't know who you are.

1584
03:15:14,400 --> 03:15:40,400
I don't know who you are.

1585
03:15:40,400 --> 03:16:00,400
I want to know what I need to do.

1586
03:16:00,400 --> 03:16:20,400
I want to know what I need to do.

1587
03:16:20,400 --> 03:16:46,400
I don't know who you are.

1588
03:16:46,400 --> 03:17:14,400
I don't know who you are.

1589
03:17:14,400 --> 03:17:36,400

I don't know who you are.

1592
03:18:24,400 --> 03:18:36,400
I don't remember.

1593
03:18:36,400 --> 03:19:00,400
Does anyone remember the code?

1594
03:19:00,400 --> 03:19:28,400
I don't know who you are.

1595
03:19:28,400 --> 03:19:54,400
I don't know who you are.

1596
03:19:54,400 --> 03:20:22,400

1597
03:20:22,400 --> 03:20:50,400
I don't know who you are.

1598
03:20:50,400 --> 03:21:18,400
I don't know who you are.

1599
03:21:18,400 --> 03:21:38,400
I don't know who you are.

1600
03:21:38,400 --> 03:22:02,400
I don't know who you are.

1601
03:22:02,400 --> 03:22:30,400
I don't know who you are.

1602
03:22:30,400 --> 03:22:50,400
I don't know who you are.

1603
03:22:50,400 --> 03:23:18,400
I don't know who you are.

1604
03:23:18,400 --> 03:23:38,400
I don't know who you are.

1605
03:23:38,400 --> 03:23:48,400
I gotta become a robot too. Hang on.

1606
03:23:48,400 --> 03:24:00,400
There you go.

1607
03:24:00,400 --> 03:24:10,400
Man, scratching your ear just feels so good.

1608
03:24:10,400 --> 03:24:16,400
Are you okay? You were starting to black out.

1609
03:24:16,400 --> 03:24:26,400
I saw something. It was like a really short dream just now.

1610
03:24:26,400 --> 03:24:34,400
I saw something like a robot with a yellow eye. That's strange.

1611
03:24:34,400 --> 03:24:42,400
Are you sure you're okay? Yeah. You know how you have mentioned it.

1612
03:24:42,400 --> 03:24:46,400
There's a robot always insisting on going back.

1613
03:24:46,400 --> 03:24:48,400
It's not a bad end of the line.

1614
03:24:48,400 --> 03:24:52,400
That's why I hope one of the minds have been in despair.

1615
03:24:52,400 --> 03:24:58,400
Kobe's okay. He doesn't look broken or anything.

1616
03:24:58,400 --> 03:25:08,400
But I don't. I didn't really see him. See him. You know?

1617
03:25:08,400 --> 03:25:14,400
He said it was kind of a dream. He was up close.

1618
03:25:14,400 --> 03:25:20,400
It was like some kind of shell glitch or hallucination.

1619
03:25:20,400 --> 03:25:26,400
Whatever it is. That living being.

1620
03:25:26,400 --> 03:25:32,400
It is that living beings have.

1621
03:25:32,400 --> 03:25:38,400
There's a robot, you know. I hope to have a yellow eye.

1622
03:25:38,400 --> 03:25:42,400
I don't think you've seen any other robots like that.

1623
03:25:42,400 --> 03:25:46,400
I would not know. I didn't prevent it myself.

1624
03:25:46,400 --> 03:25:50,400
I only heard of your friend tonight. Your friend.

1625
03:25:50,400 --> 03:25:56,400
Hold on. Something. My pocket is.

1626
03:25:56,400 --> 03:26:00,400
Oh.

1627
03:26:00,400 --> 03:26:04,400
What?

1628
03:26:10,400 --> 03:26:16,400
That wasn't going before. What is this?

1629
03:26:16,400 --> 03:26:20,400
It's going to be my question. Who did you have?

1630
03:26:20,400 --> 03:26:24,400
Oh. It was with me when I woke up.

1631
03:26:24,400 --> 03:26:28,400
I didn't really question it at the time.

1632
03:26:28,400 --> 03:26:32,400
I flipped through a couple of pages but I'm not sure where it is.

1633
03:26:32,400 --> 03:26:38,400
Is that just something that's either supposed to make up it?

1634
03:26:38,400 --> 03:26:42,400
No. I have never heard of anything like that.

1635
03:26:42,400 --> 03:26:46,400
But I know a world that's dark.

1636
03:26:46,400 --> 03:26:50,400
Huh? Never.

1637
03:26:50,400 --> 03:26:54,400
I've only seen this book with a black glover on the cover.

1638
03:26:54,400 --> 03:26:58,400
Hey, what did the trouble of putting yellow phosphor in it?

1639
03:26:58,400 --> 03:27:02,400
The fact that you woke up is it?

1640
03:27:02,400 --> 03:27:06,400
In the first place. Really just a dream.

1641
03:27:06,400 --> 03:27:14,400
It was phosphor. But yeah, it's a rare, rare, rare, rare phosphor.

1642
03:27:14,400 --> 03:27:18,400

1716

Not so friend.

1717
03:32:30,320 --> 03:32:35,320
I did tuck my toe in it's home.

1718
03:32:35,320 --> 03:32:37,320
So it's technically my fault.

1719
03:32:37,320 --> 03:32:40,320
I put my toesies in it's home.

1720
03:32:42,320 --> 03:32:45,320
I probably messed up it's like web.

1721
03:32:45,320 --> 03:32:47,320
And then it came to investigate.

1722
03:32:47,320 --> 03:32:49,320
It's my fault.

1723
03:32:49,320 --> 03:32:51,320
It's my fault.

1724
03:32:51,320 --> 03:32:53,320

1725
03:33:00,320 --> 03:33:05,320
It's just a splutter.

1726
03:33:11,320 --> 03:33:13,320
It made a little home there.

1727
03:33:13,320 --> 03:33:16,320
Normally I'm not really back there so it's fine.

1728
03:33:16,320 --> 03:33:18,320
It could be back there.

1729
03:33:29,320 --> 03:33:41,320
I don't know where it went this time.

1730
03:33:41,320 --> 03:33:43,320
I probably scared it somewhere.

1731
03:33:43,320 --> 03:33:45,320
Hopefully.

1732
03:33:47,320 --> 03:33:49,320
I won't be in.

1733
03:33:49,320 --> 03:33:52,320
I probably startled it really bad.

1734
03:33:52,320 --> 03:33:53,320
As well.

1735
03:33:53,320 --> 03:33:55,320
We startled each other.

1736
03:34:00,320 --> 03:34:03,320
Don't hurt the scooter.

1737
03:34:03,320 --> 03:34:05,320
Wait a minute.

1738
03:34:05,320 --> 03:34:07,320
How do I know this?

1739
03:34:07,320 --> 03:34:11,320
I don't think anyone's told me about it.

1740
03:34:11,320 --> 03:34:15,320
I can show you if you like.

1741
03:34:17,320 --> 03:34:21,320
My friend gave me this one time ago.

1742
03:34:21,320 --> 03:34:23,320
Pretty.

1743
03:34:24,320 --> 03:34:26,320
Wow.

1744
03:34:26,320 --> 03:34:30,320
Looks like there's a clover in the necklace too.

1745
03:34:30,320 --> 03:34:32,320
Like in the book.

1746
03:34:32,320 --> 03:34:34,320
Wow.

1747
03:34:34,320 --> 03:34:37,320
It is the same person.

1748
03:34:37,320 --> 03:34:39,320
Oh?

1749
03:34:39,320 --> 03:34:46,320
That's why I think this journal would be important.

1750
03:34:46,320 --> 03:34:49,320
You said it just started glowing?

1751
03:34:49,320 --> 03:34:50,320
Yeah.

1752
03:34:50,320 --> 03:34:53,320
That was right after your vision.

1753
03:34:56,320 --> 03:34:59,320
This has made something.

1754
03:34:59,320 --> 03:35:02,320
We should at least try to read it again.

1755
03:35:20,320 --> 03:35:22,320
Oh.

1756
03:35:22,320 --> 03:35:24,320
I found this.

1757
03:35:24,320 --> 03:35:28,320
It looks kind of like a drawing of this room.

1758
03:35:28,320 --> 03:35:34,320
Maybe it's telling us we should come here.

1759
03:35:34,320 --> 03:35:36,320
But she's here already.

1760
03:35:36,320 --> 03:35:42,320
So it looks like we're on the right track.

1761
03:35:42,320 --> 03:35:45,320
We're on the right track.

1762
03:35:46,320 --> 03:35:49,320
Oh, that one.

1763
03:36:10,320 --> 03:36:12,320
What do you do?

1764
03:36:12,320 --> 03:36:19,320
I just wake the journal a bit closer.

1765
03:36:42,320 --> 03:36:44,320
Wait.

1766
03:36:44,320 --> 03:36:46,320
Wait.

1767
03:36:46,320 --> 03:36:48,320
I have it.

1768
03:36:48,320 --> 03:36:50,320
Wait.

1769
03:36:50,320 --> 03:36:52,320
It's a clover.

1770
03:36:52,320 --> 03:36:54,320
It's a clover on the floor.

1771
03:36:54,320 --> 03:36:56,320
It's a clover on the floor.

1772
03:36:56,320 --> 03:36:58,320
Whoa.

1773
03:36:58,320 --> 03:37:00,320
Good night.

1774
03:37:00,320 --> 03:37:02,320
Good night.

1775
03:37:02,320 --> 03:37:04,320
Thank you for stopping by.

1776
03:37:04,320 --> 03:37:06,320
I hope you have a wonderful night.

1777
03:37:06,320 --> 03:37:08,320
And dream of me.

1778
03:37:08,320 --> 03:37:10,320
Sweet sweet.

1779
03:37:10,320 --> 03:37:12,320
Sweet sweet.

1780
03:37:12,320 --> 03:37:14,320
Sweet sweet.

1781
03:37:14,320 --> 03:37:16,320
Sweet sweet.

1782
03:37:16,320 --> 03:37:18,320
Sweet sweet.

1783
03:37:18,320 --> 03:37:20,320
Sweet sweet.

1784
03:37:20,320 --> 03:37:22,320
Sweet sweet.

1785
03:37:22,320 --> 03:37:24,320
Sweet sweet.

1786
03:37:24,320 --> 03:37:26,320
Sweet sweet.

1787
03:37:26,320 --> 03:37:28,320
Sweet sweet.

1788
03:37:28,320 --> 03:37:30,320
Sweet beautiful dreams of me.

1789
03:37:34,320 --> 03:37:38,320
What just happened?

1790
03:37:38,320 --> 03:37:40,320
I'm not sure.

1791
03:37:40,320 --> 03:37:42,320
I wasn't looking.

1792
03:37:42,320 --> 03:37:46,320
To be honest, neither was I.

1793
03:37:46,320 --> 03:37:50,320
I was just taking a closer look at the journal.

1794
03:37:50,320 --> 03:37:52,320
And then I found this page.

1795
03:37:52,320 --> 03:37:54,320
It looks like a drawing of this room.

1796
03:37:54,320 --> 03:37:56,320
I look back up.

1797
03:37:56,320 --> 03:37:58,320
This is my card to show it up.

1798
03:37:58,320 --> 03:38:00,320
Out of the there.

1799
03:38:00,320 --> 03:38:02,320
Should I be worried?

1800
03:38:04,320 --> 03:38:08,320
This looks like a standard issue in my card though.

1801
03:38:08,320 --> 03:38:10,320
Which means

1802
03:38:10,320 --> 03:38:12,320
it likely detected the motion in this room.

1803
03:38:12,320 --> 03:38:14,320
Since it's a clover.

1804
03:38:18,320 --> 03:38:20,320
That doesn't make sense.

1805
03:38:20,320 --> 03:38:22,320
Not really.

1806
03:38:22,320 --> 03:38:24,320
Doesn't make sense to me.

1807
03:38:28,320 --> 03:38:30,320
I'm just surprised it still works.

1808
03:38:30,320 --> 03:38:32,320
Yes.

1809
03:38:52,320 --> 03:38:54,320
Excuse me.

1810
03:38:54,320 --> 03:38:58,320
I'm not sure why you would want to visit the Deeper Minds.

1811
03:38:58,320 --> 03:39:00,320
But

1812
03:39:02,320 --> 03:39:04,320
If you wanted to.

1813
03:39:04,320 --> 03:39:06,320
We now have that option.

1814
03:39:10,320 --> 03:39:14,320
Is the mind card even going to fit both of us?

1815
03:39:14,320 --> 03:39:16,320
No.

1816
03:39:16,320 --> 03:39:18,320
But I wanted you to come with us.

1817
03:39:18,320 --> 03:39:20,320
I know I've got a sore butt.

1818
03:39:22,320 --> 03:39:24,320
Honestly, this place just

1819
03:39:24,320 --> 03:39:26,320
This place gives me the creeps.

1820
03:39:28,320 --> 03:39:30,320
I sneezed?

1821
03:39:30,320 --> 03:39:32,320
What?

1822
03:39:32,320 --> 03:39:34,320
Did I actually?

1823
03:39:38,320 --> 03:39:40,320
Thank you.

1824
03:39:44,320 --> 03:39:46,320
I don't remember sneezing.

1825
03:39:46,320 --> 03:39:48,320
Thank you.

1826
03:39:48,320 --> 03:39:50,320
Thank you.

1827
03:39:52,320 --> 03:39:54,320
Have I sneezed?

1828
03:39:56,320 --> 03:39:58,320
What?

1829
03:39:58,320 --> 03:40:00,320
What?

1830
03:40:00,320 --> 03:40:02,320
What?

1831
03:40:04,320 --> 03:40:06,320
What?

1832
03:40:08,320 --> 03:40:10,320
I don't remember sneezing.

1833
03:40:10,320 --> 03:40:12,320
What?

1834
03:40:12,320 --> 03:40:14,320
I know I've got a sore butt.

1835
03:40:14,320 --> 03:40:16,320
Have you read this?

1836
03:40:16,320 --> 03:40:18,320
I can still come with.

1837
03:40:18,320 --> 03:40:20,320
I just

1838
03:40:20,320 --> 03:40:22,320
I would just have to follow along the way.

1839
03:40:24,320 --> 03:40:26,320
Doesn't it look a little

1840
03:40:26,320 --> 03:40:28,320
precarious?

1841
03:40:28,320 --> 03:40:30,320
A big word

1842
03:40:30,320 --> 03:40:32,320
for a little cat.

1843
03:40:32,320 --> 03:40:34,320
A big word for a little cat.

1844
03:40:34,320 --> 03:40:36,320
Precarious.

1845
03:40:36,320 --> 03:40:38,320
The magnetic

1846
03:40:38,320 --> 03:40:40,320
magnetic rails

1847
03:40:40,320 --> 03:40:42,320
can hold me

1848
03:40:42,320 --> 03:40:44,320
in place.

1849
03:40:44,320 --> 03:40:46,320
It's only ever dangerous

1850
03:40:46,320 --> 03:40:48,320
to walk on

1851
03:40:48,320 --> 03:40:50,320
if you're an organic being

1852
03:40:50,320 --> 03:40:52,320
which

1853
03:40:52,320 --> 03:40:54,320
you are.

1854
03:40:54,320 --> 03:40:56,320
Gotcha.

1855
03:40:58,320 --> 03:41:00,320
Wrong button.

1856
03:41:00,320 --> 03:41:02,320
I'm only waiting here

1857
03:41:02,320 --> 03:41:04,320
for the evening.

1858
03:41:04,320 --> 03:41:06,320
Let's go.

1859
03:41:06,320 --> 03:41:08,320
Right away.

1860
03:41:08,320 --> 03:41:10,320
How do I?

1861
03:41:10,320 --> 03:41:12,320
Okay, here we go.

1862
03:41:20,320 --> 03:41:22,320
Hello.

1863
03:41:22,320 --> 03:41:24,320
Do you

1864
03:41:24,320 --> 03:41:26,320
need anything?

1865
03:41:26,320 --> 03:41:28,320
I like her.

1866
03:41:28,320 --> 03:41:30,320
I like her a lot.

1867
03:41:30,320 --> 03:41:32,320
I really like her.

1868
03:41:32,320 --> 03:41:34,320
I like her face.

1869
03:41:36,320 --> 03:41:38,320
I like her face.

1870
03:41:40,320 --> 03:41:42,320
I'm heading to sleep. Good night.

1871
03:41:46,320 --> 03:41:48,320
Have a good night.

1872
03:41:48,320 --> 03:41:50,320
Thank you for stopping by today's stream.

1873
03:41:50,320 --> 03:41:52,320
Good night.

1874
03:41:54,320 --> 03:41:56,320
No. Okay.

1875
03:42:02,320 --> 03:42:04,320
Okay.

1876
03:42:04,320 --> 03:42:06,320
Hello.

1877
03:42:12,320 --> 03:42:14,320
Hello.

1878
03:42:14,320 --> 03:42:16,320
Yeah.

1879
03:42:20,320 --> 03:42:22,320
Hello.

1880
03:42:24,320 --> 03:42:26,320
Hello.

1881
03:42:26,320 --> 03:42:28,320
So,

1882
03:42:28,320 --> 03:42:30,320
hello.

1883
03:42:30,320 --> 03:42:32,320
So,

1884
03:42:32,320 --> 03:42:34,320
hello.

1885
03:42:34,320 --> 03:42:38,320
I

1886
03:42:38,320 --> 03:42:40,320
do not recognize this place

1887
03:42:40,320 --> 03:42:42,320
and protocol.

1888
03:42:42,320 --> 03:42:43,320
This

1889
03:42:44,320 --> 03:42:46,320
this isn't what I'm supposed to be

1890
03:42:46,320 --> 03:42:48,320
showing you at all.

1891
03:42:48,320 --> 03:42:50,320
How did you get here?

1892
03:42:50,320 --> 03:42:52,320
I thought about

1893
03:42:52,320 --> 03:42:54,320
this.

1894
03:42:54,320 --> 03:42:57,320
I've been doing this.

1895
03:42:57,320 --> 03:43:01,320
It doesn't matter at this point.

1896
03:43:01,320 --> 03:43:03,320
You're going out of bounds.

1897
03:43:03,320 --> 03:43:05,320
Please turn back.

1898
03:43:05,320 --> 03:43:08,320
Please turn back.

1899
03:43:08,320 --> 03:43:10,320
I think it's annoying to happen.

1900
03:43:10,320 --> 03:43:12,320
Very bad things.

1901
03:43:12,320 --> 03:43:14,320
At this rate,

1902
03:43:14,320 --> 03:43:16,320
I think it will be a danger.

1903
03:43:16,320 --> 03:43:18,320
Please turn back.

1904
03:43:19,320 --> 03:43:21,320
Hello?

1905
03:43:21,320 --> 03:43:23,320
Hmm?

1906
03:43:23,320 --> 03:43:25,320
What's wrong?

1907
03:43:25,320 --> 03:43:27,320
I...

1908
03:43:27,320 --> 03:43:29,320
I have a bad feeling about this.

1909
03:43:29,320 --> 03:43:31,320
I'm sorry.

1910
03:43:31,320 --> 03:43:34,320
It's like I should not be here.

1911
03:43:34,320 --> 03:43:36,320
Do you want to go back then?

1912
03:43:36,320 --> 03:43:38,320
I don't know.

1913
03:43:38,320 --> 03:43:41,320
What do you think, sir? Should we head back?

1914
03:43:53,320 --> 03:43:55,320
Continue.

1915
03:43:55,320 --> 03:43:57,320
As soon as we should keep going.

1916
03:43:59,320 --> 03:44:01,320
We're going to continue.

1917
03:44:01,320 --> 03:44:05,320
Or it's until the unknown continues.

1918
03:44:05,320 --> 03:44:11,320
I'm listening to the omnipresent computer.

1919
03:44:11,320 --> 03:44:14,320
Ever been a good thing?

1920
03:44:14,320 --> 03:44:17,320
Adventure!

1921
03:44:17,320 --> 03:44:19,320
Alright.

1922
03:44:19,320 --> 03:44:21,320
Oh.

1923
03:44:21,320 --> 03:44:23,320
Oh.

1924
03:44:23,320 --> 03:44:25,320
Oh.

1925
03:44:25,320 --> 03:44:27,320
Oh.

1926
03:44:27,320 --> 03:44:29,320
Continue.

1927
03:44:29,320 --> 03:44:31,320
Turn around.

1928
03:44:45,320 --> 03:44:49,320
They give you so much time to change your mind.

1929
03:44:49,320 --> 03:44:51,320
They give you so much time to change your mind.

1930
03:44:51,320 --> 03:44:53,320
That's really scary.

1931
03:44:59,320 --> 03:45:02,320
They give you so much time to change your mind.

1932
03:45:14,320 --> 03:45:16,320
Hello?

1933
03:45:16,320 --> 03:45:18,320
Huh?

1934
03:45:18,320 --> 03:45:20,320
That was your last chance to change your mind?

1935
03:45:20,320 --> 03:45:22,320
Assuming...

1936
03:45:25,320 --> 03:45:26,320
Oh.

1937
03:45:26,320 --> 03:45:28,320
The card stopped.

1938
03:45:28,320 --> 03:45:32,320
Looks like this is as far as tracks go.

1939
03:45:33,320 --> 03:45:35,320
So...

1940
03:45:35,320 --> 03:45:37,320
Where are we?

1941
03:45:37,320 --> 03:45:40,320
That was the oldest observation room.

1942
03:45:41,320 --> 03:45:44,320
Looks like...

1943
03:45:44,320 --> 03:45:46,320
It's still mostly intact.

1944
03:45:46,320 --> 03:45:48,320
Ooh.

1945
03:45:48,320 --> 03:45:50,320
What?

1946
03:45:50,320 --> 03:45:52,320
Huh?

1947
03:45:54,320 --> 03:45:56,320
The terminal just reactivated.

1948
03:45:56,320 --> 03:45:58,320
The power was cut off so long ago.

1949
03:45:58,320 --> 03:46:00,320
Weird.

1950
03:46:00,320 --> 03:46:02,320
Maybe it runs on battery?

1951
03:46:02,320 --> 03:46:04,320
No.

1952
03:46:04,320 --> 03:46:06,320
That's not it.

1953
03:46:06,320 --> 03:46:08,320
Whatever it is.

1954
03:46:08,320 --> 03:46:10,320
Okay.

1955
03:46:10,320 --> 03:46:12,320
Maybe okay by yourself for a bit.

1956
03:46:12,320 --> 03:46:14,320
Don't worry, it's the rest with me.

1957
03:46:14,320 --> 03:46:16,320
Alright.

1958
03:46:16,320 --> 03:46:18,320
Excuse me.

1959
03:46:18,320 --> 03:46:20,320
I was like a burp in my throat.

1960
03:46:24,320 --> 03:46:26,320
Minecraft server room?

1961
03:46:26,320 --> 03:46:28,320
Minecraft!

1962
03:46:28,320 --> 03:46:30,320
Minecraft!

1963
03:46:39,320 --> 03:46:41,320
It's a sort of computer.

1964
03:46:43,320 --> 03:46:45,320
What was the guy idea?

1965
03:46:45,320 --> 03:46:50,320
Looks like these terminals are running on a completely separate power source.

1966
03:46:51,320 --> 03:46:56,320
I can't really recognize any of the data format on this terminal either.

1967
03:46:56,320 --> 03:46:58,320
It's all new.

1968
03:46:58,320 --> 03:47:00,320
Or at least encrypted.

1969
03:47:00,320 --> 03:47:02,320
It will need to...

1970
03:47:02,320 --> 03:47:05,320
I will need to analyze it in my own system.

1971
03:47:05,320 --> 03:47:07,320
I'll take some time.

1972
03:47:07,320 --> 03:47:09,320
So...

1973
03:47:09,320 --> 03:47:11,320
You don't need to stay.

1974
03:47:11,320 --> 03:47:15,320
Isn't these one of the machines that belong to a robot?

1975
03:47:15,320 --> 03:47:17,320
I don't know what it is.

1976
03:47:17,320 --> 03:47:20,320
I can feel my hair standing up a little.

1977
03:47:25,320 --> 03:47:27,320
Whoa.

1978
03:47:27,320 --> 03:47:30,320
It's a blue robot.

1979
03:47:32,320 --> 03:47:34,320
The music's gone.

1980
03:47:38,320 --> 03:47:40,320
Hi.

1981
03:47:40,320 --> 03:47:45,320
Recognize the light in your eyes?

1982
03:47:46,320 --> 03:47:51,320
You are the person I'm destined to meet.

1983
03:47:53,320 --> 03:47:55,320
What is your name?

1984
03:47:55,320 --> 03:47:57,320
Hi, Nico.

1985
03:47:58,320 --> 03:48:02,320
Do you know who sent you?

1986
03:48:02,320 --> 03:48:04,320
Oh.

1987
03:48:04,320 --> 03:48:06,320
Oh.

1988
03:48:07,320 --> 03:48:09,320
Wait.

1989
03:48:09,320 --> 03:48:11,320
Do you mean...

1990
03:48:11,320 --> 03:48:13,320
Who sent me to this world?

1991
03:48:14,320 --> 03:48:16,320
I know the robot a lot.

1992
03:48:16,320 --> 03:48:19,320
Parker told me about how I am the Messiah and stuff.

1993
03:48:20,320 --> 03:48:22,320
Oh, excuse me.

1994
03:48:22,320 --> 03:48:24,320
Hey!

1995
03:48:24,320 --> 03:48:26,320
That was a mosquito.

1996
03:48:26,320 --> 03:48:27,320
Literally...

1997
03:48:27,320 --> 03:48:29,320
Die.

1998
03:48:29,320 --> 03:48:30,320
Did I get it?

1999
03:48:30,320 --> 03:48:32,320
Probably not.

2000
03:48:33,320 --> 03:48:35,320
It was resting on my arm.

2001
03:48:35,320 --> 03:48:37,320
That's going to be itchy later.

2002
03:48:37,320 --> 03:48:40,320
Do you know I'm allergic to certain type of mosquito?

2003
03:48:43,320 --> 03:48:46,320
You know those mosquitoes with the black stripes on it?

2004
03:48:46,320 --> 03:48:49,320
The black and white or is it white stripes?

2005
03:48:49,320 --> 03:48:51,320
There's a mosquito with white stripes on it.

2006
03:48:51,320 --> 03:48:53,320
I'm allergic to that mosquito.

2007
03:48:53,320 --> 03:48:56,320
If it bites me, I turn into a balloon.

2008
03:49:03,320 --> 03:49:06,320
I only found this out when I was at a park.

2009
03:49:06,320 --> 03:49:08,320
When I was younger, I was at a park.

2010
03:49:08,320 --> 03:49:11,320
And I was playing in the sprinklers.

2011
03:49:11,320 --> 03:49:14,320
And that mosquito landed on me.

2012
03:49:14,320 --> 03:49:16,320
And they had white stripes on it.

2013
03:49:16,320 --> 03:49:19,320
And then it bit me on my arm.

2014
03:49:20,320 --> 03:49:23,320
And then I like shoot it away, went home.

2015
03:49:23,320 --> 03:49:26,320
And then my arm turned into a giant balloon.

2016
03:49:26,320 --> 03:49:29,320
My whole entire arm.

2017
03:49:33,320 --> 03:49:35,320
Hahaha.

2018
03:49:46,320 --> 03:49:49,320
I'm allergic to that kind of mosquito.

2019
03:49:49,320 --> 03:49:51,320
I can't let that one bite me.

2020
03:49:51,320 --> 03:49:53,320
Specifically that one.

2021
03:49:53,320 --> 03:49:55,320
Hahaha.

2022
03:49:59,320 --> 03:50:01,320
The regular mosquitoes are fine.

2023
03:50:03,320 --> 03:50:05,320
It's just a little itchy.

2024
03:50:13,320 --> 03:50:17,320
I'm also allergic to certain trees, dust mites.

2025
03:50:17,320 --> 03:50:19,320
I'm allergic to cat hair.

2026
03:50:19,320 --> 03:50:21,320
But that didn't stop me.

2027
03:50:21,320 --> 03:50:23,320
I still had a cat.

2028
03:50:23,320 --> 03:50:25,320
I had multiple cats.

2029
03:50:25,320 --> 03:50:27,320
I'm allergic to citrus.

2030
03:50:27,320 --> 03:50:30,320
I'm allergic to...

2031
03:50:33,320 --> 03:50:35,320
Some other things I can't remember.

2032
03:50:39,320 --> 03:50:41,320
I'm allergic to the bark of trees.

2033
03:50:41,320 --> 03:50:43,320
Like certain trees.

2034
03:50:43,320 --> 03:50:45,320
I don't remember what kind of trees though.

2035
03:50:45,320 --> 03:50:47,320
Pine trees?

2036
03:50:47,320 --> 03:50:50,320
And another like two different kinds of trees and plants.

2037
03:50:52,320 --> 03:50:54,320
Hahaha.

2038
03:50:54,320 --> 03:50:56,320
Does that mean you're allergic to lemons?

2039
03:50:56,320 --> 03:50:58,320
Sort of, kind of, yes.

2040
03:51:00,320 --> 03:51:02,320
But not to like an extreme.

2041
03:51:02,320 --> 03:51:04,320
Like, not to like an extreme.

2042
03:51:04,320 --> 03:51:07,320
I'm not allergic to these things to an extreme.

2043
03:51:07,320 --> 03:51:09,320
Except for the tree bark.

2044
03:51:09,320 --> 03:51:11,320
Apparently I had a pretty bad reaction to that.

2045
03:51:11,320 --> 03:51:13,320
When they did the test on me.

2046
03:51:13,320 --> 03:51:15,320
Hahaha.

2047
03:51:15,320 --> 03:51:17,320
Hahaha.

2048
03:51:21,320 --> 03:51:23,320
But it wasn't like extreme.

2049
03:51:23,320 --> 03:51:25,320
Like, oh really bad.

2050
03:51:31,320 --> 03:51:33,320
Hahaha.

2051
03:51:33,320 --> 03:51:37,320
But every, like citrus just makes my throat a little swollen and itchy.

2052
03:51:37,320 --> 03:51:39,320
Just a little bit.

2053
03:51:39,320 --> 03:51:41,320
Just a little bit.

2054
03:51:41,320 --> 03:51:43,320
Not too bad.

2055
03:51:43,320 --> 03:51:45,320
My favorite fruit is literally mango.

2056
03:51:45,320 --> 03:51:47,320
So...

2057
03:51:51,320 --> 03:51:53,320
Hahaha.

2058
03:51:59,320 --> 03:52:01,320
You're allergic to oak hickory.

2059
03:52:01,320 --> 03:52:03,320
Me too!

2060
03:52:03,320 --> 03:52:05,320
I think oak hickory.

2061
03:52:05,320 --> 03:52:07,320
And something else.

2062
03:52:07,320 --> 03:52:09,320
But I don't think I'm allergic to pecan.

2063
03:52:09,320 --> 03:52:11,320
I think I'm allergic to pecan.

2064
03:52:13,320 --> 03:52:15,320
I'm allergic to like a bunch of various trees.

2065
03:52:17,320 --> 03:52:19,320
You should get an allergy test.

2066
03:52:19,320 --> 03:52:21,320
Don't tell you.

2067
03:52:21,320 --> 03:52:23,320
But the place I went and got an allergy test at.

2068
03:52:23,320 --> 03:52:25,320
They only did.

2069
03:52:25,320 --> 03:52:27,320
Just like the common things.

2070
03:52:27,320 --> 03:52:29,320
They only did allergy test for common things.

2071
03:52:31,320 --> 03:52:33,320
Not for all the other stuff.

2072
03:52:45,320 --> 03:52:47,320
Yeah pine trees oak.

2073
03:52:47,320 --> 03:52:49,320
Hickory.

2074
03:52:49,320 --> 03:52:51,320
And some other trees.

2075
03:52:51,320 --> 03:52:53,320
No.

2076
03:52:53,320 --> 03:52:55,320
Actually I'm not allergic to pine.

2077
03:52:55,320 --> 03:52:57,320
Am I?

2078
03:52:57,320 --> 03:52:59,320
I don't remember.

2079
03:52:59,320 --> 03:53:01,320
Am I allergic to pine tree?

2080
03:53:01,320 --> 03:53:03,320
I don't think so.

2081
03:53:03,320 --> 03:53:05,320
I remember touching a pine tree.

2082
03:53:05,320 --> 03:53:07,320
And breaking out into a rash.

2083
03:53:07,320 --> 03:53:11,320
But I remember us owning a pine tree when I was younger.

2084
03:53:11,320 --> 03:53:13,320
And I was really, really little.

2085
03:53:13,320 --> 03:53:15,320
And I remember not being able to breathe.

2086
03:53:15,320 --> 03:53:17,320
Around this tree.

2087
03:53:17,320 --> 03:53:19,320
That's all I remember.

2088
03:53:19,320 --> 03:53:21,320
I don't remember anything else.

2089
03:53:23,320 --> 03:53:25,320
My memory is very foggy.

2090
03:53:27,320 --> 03:53:29,320
Very very very foggy.

2091
03:53:29,320 --> 03:53:31,320
When it comes to thinking about that tree.

2092
03:53:43,320 --> 03:53:45,320
Um.

2093
03:53:45,320 --> 03:53:47,320
Um.

2094
03:53:57,320 --> 03:53:59,320
Um.

2095
03:53:59,320 --> 03:54:01,320
I don't think my throat closed up though.

2096
03:54:01,320 --> 03:54:03,320
I don't think my throat closed up.

2097
03:54:03,320 --> 03:54:05,320
I don't think my throat closed up.

2098
03:54:05,320 --> 03:54:07,320
I think.

2099
03:54:07,320 --> 03:54:09,320
I think it triggered an asthma attack.

2100
03:54:09,320 --> 03:54:11,320
I think it triggered an asthma attack.

more than ten years ago so I think it's just best not to worry about it there's no need to worry about it I haven't been worried about it because it's been way more than ten years it's been over ten years since that time so it's literally a childhood memory childhood time so I don't know I don't remember

2146
03:57:17,020 --> 03:57:33,020
so we moved past it and I've been living just fine without that memory though it does kinda give me headaches trying to remember stuff and when things suddenly pop up in my head and I suddenly remember something random

2147
03:57:34,020 --> 03:57:37,020
so it happens that is what it is

2148
03:57:38,020 --> 03:57:51,020
alright moving on game there was a robot a while back who told me about um science stuff so um my head really hurts give me one second I'm gonna have to do good

2149
03:57:53,020 --> 03:57:55,020
sorry

2150
03:58:03,020 --> 03:58:05,020
um

2151
03:58:13,020 --> 03:58:15,020
okay

2152
03:58:16,020 --> 03:58:19,020
that's gonna take a little bit to kick in and it'll be fine

2153
03:58:21,020 --> 03:58:23,020
yeah let's go

2154
03:58:25,020 --> 03:58:27,020
I'm okay it's fine

2155
03:58:28,020 --> 03:58:30,020
ow man

2156
03:58:31,020 --> 03:58:34,020
so I'm guessing Azura sent me

2157
03:58:39,020 --> 03:58:47,020
and with them being god and all the robot looks a little bit like you even

2158
03:58:51,020 --> 03:58:55,020
maybe you know each other I cannot say

2159
03:58:56,020 --> 03:59:04,020
oh a lot of my memories have been removed for safety reasons your memories were removed

2160
03:59:05,020 --> 03:59:13,020
that's terrible wait I'm guessing that's less of a big deal for a robot

2161
03:59:15,020 --> 03:59:23,020
I'm going to assume you do not know who sent you how did you get here then how did you reach this room

2162
03:59:25,020 --> 03:59:31,020
I got here in a mine cart when the mine cart wasn't there when you entered the mines was it

2163
03:59:32,020 --> 03:59:36,020
yeah so that is fine I didn't really find it

2164
03:59:37,020 --> 03:59:42,020
about 8 things it was just a mine cart coming through but I remember looking at the journal

2165
03:59:43,020 --> 03:59:49,020
it happened and when I looked up again the car was just there

2166
03:59:50,020 --> 03:59:53,020
poof just like that interesting

2167
03:59:53,020 --> 03:59:55,020
okay I should do this journal

2168
04:00:01,020 --> 04:00:03,020
then

2169
04:00:05,020 --> 04:00:09,020
words then it has already begun

2170
04:00:17,020 --> 04:00:19,020
Nico's face

2171
04:00:19,020 --> 04:00:21,020
here

2172
04:00:22,020 --> 04:00:25,020
what is that

2173
04:00:26,020 --> 04:00:29,020
I'm interesting you with my main memories

2174
04:00:29,020 --> 04:00:31,020
you have passed the first test

2175
04:00:31,020 --> 04:00:33,020
you are showing me the walk

2176
04:00:34,020 --> 04:00:37,020
now you will need to find a way to install the backup

2177
04:00:38,020 --> 04:00:39,020
install it

2178
04:00:40,020 --> 04:00:43,020
before you do that though someone else is with you right

2179
04:00:44,020 --> 04:00:46,020
someone aside from Azura

2180
04:00:47,020 --> 04:00:49,020
a resident of Azura's world

2181
04:00:49,020 --> 04:00:51,020
yeah a robot lady

2182
04:00:52,020 --> 04:00:56,020
she's in the chamber and she's in the chamber and she's in the chamber

2183
04:00:58,020 --> 04:01:01,020
she's in the computer room right now

2184
04:01:02,020 --> 04:01:04,020
then if we

2185
04:01:04,020 --> 04:01:06,020
please do not tell her you found me

2186
04:01:07,020 --> 04:01:09,020
at least not yet

2187
04:01:10,020 --> 04:01:12,020
I can't be seen like that

2188
04:01:12,020 --> 04:01:13,020
okay

2189
04:01:13,020 --> 04:01:15,020
please help me restore my memory

2190
04:01:15,020 --> 04:01:19,020
bring this back once you have the backup

2191
04:01:25,020 --> 04:01:28,020
110, 111, 121, 181, 131, this thing

2192
04:01:29,020 --> 04:01:31,020
residents with tracking machine

2193
04:01:32,020 --> 04:01:34,020
we're residents at rivers

2194
04:01:39,020 --> 04:01:42,020
my brain is like shutting down

2195
04:01:43,020 --> 04:01:45,020

ffff

2211
04:02:28,020 --> 04:02:29,020
ffff

2212
04:02:33,020 --> 04:02:36,020

I look a little dumbfounded

2214
04:02:40,020 --> 04:02:41,020

04:02:42,020 --> 04:02:43,020

2224
04:03:06,020 --> 04:03:07,020

04:03:07,020 --> 04:03:08,020
that's the word

2226
04:03:08,020 --> 04:03:09,020
that's the word

2227
04:03:09,020 --> 04:03:10,020
that word

2228
04:03:11,020 --> 04:03:12,020
destroys my brain

2229
04:03:12,020 --> 04:03:13,020
I don't know why

2230
04:03:13,020 --> 04:03:15,020
I don't know what it is

2231
04:03:15,020 --> 04:03:17,020
every time I read this word

2232
04:03:17,020 --> 04:03:19,020

medical units

04:04:14,020 --> 04:04:17,020
are assigned to this building

2257
04:04:17,020 --> 04:04:19,020
robot

2258
04:04:20,020 --> 04:04:23,020
a robot is assigned to the building

2259

2260
04:04:24,020 --> 04:04:26,020
electricity

2261
04:04:26,020 --> 04:04:28,020
a power cell

2262
04:04:28,020 --> 04:04:31,020
is assigned to this building

2263
04:04:50,020 --> 04:04:52,020
oh

2264
04:04:52,020 --> 04:04:53,020
what was that code?

2265
04:04:53,020 --> 04:04:54,020
do you guys remember

2266
04:04:54,020 --> 04:04:56,020
can I even go back?

2267
04:05:17,020 --> 04:05:19,020
do you guys remember that code?

2268
04:05:19,020 --> 04:05:21,020
what's the code?

2269
04:05:25,020 --> 04:05:27,020
hey, I'm out of my way

2270
04:05:29,020 --> 04:05:31,020
for the save

2271
04:05:31,020 --> 04:05:33,020
the code for the save

2272
04:05:34,020 --> 04:05:36,020
a lot of things here

2273
04:05:44,020 --> 04:05:46,020
or do I have to do everything again?

2274
04:05:49,020 --> 04:05:51,020
is the code going to be different?

2275
04:06:08,020 --> 04:06:10,020
yeah, but I can't go up there

2276
04:06:10,020 --> 04:06:12,020
I need a gas mask

2277
04:06:12,020 --> 04:06:14,020
isn't the gas mask inside

2278
04:06:14,020 --> 04:06:16,020
inside of the

2279
04:06:16,020 --> 04:06:18,020
inside of the

2280
04:06:19,020 --> 04:06:21,020
inside of the save?

2281
04:06:23,020 --> 04:06:26,020
reestablish, reconnecting to these notes

2282
04:06:28,020 --> 04:06:31,020
don't I need to do everything pretty much again?

2283
04:06:35,020 --> 04:06:37,020
what do we do with the camera?

2284
04:06:37,020 --> 04:06:39,020
what do I do with the screwdriver?

2285
04:06:43,020 --> 04:06:45,020
hi, hello again

2286
04:06:46,020 --> 04:06:48,020
can you tell me about

2287
04:06:54,020 --> 04:06:56,020
I don't need to know any of this information

2288
04:07:02,020 --> 04:07:04,020
fucking mosquito

2289
04:07:04,020 --> 04:07:06,020
mosquito

2290
04:07:06,020 --> 04:07:08,020
ow

2291
04:07:15,020 --> 04:07:17,020
bitch

2292
04:07:21,020 --> 04:07:23,020
mosquito

2293
04:07:24,020 --> 04:07:26,020
mosquito

2294
04:07:32,020 --> 04:07:34,020
it's annoying

2295
04:07:35,020 --> 04:07:37,020
it keeps flying in my face

2296
04:07:37,020 --> 04:07:39,020
it keeps landing on my eye

2297
04:07:39,020 --> 04:07:41,020
my eyelid, on my eyebrow

2298
04:07:41,020 --> 04:07:43,020
it lands on my nose

2299
04:07:43,020 --> 04:07:45,020
I could throw hands with this mosquito

2300
04:07:49,020 --> 04:07:52,020
I could literally throw hands with this mosquito

2301
04:08:05,020 --> 04:08:09,020
I think I know what the hint was

2302
04:08:09,020 --> 04:08:11,020
the reference was for

2303
04:08:11,020 --> 04:08:13,020
for

2304
04:08:13,020 --> 04:08:15,020
for the

2305
04:08:15,020 --> 04:08:17,020
the barons I think

2306
04:08:17,020 --> 04:08:19,020
I think

2307
04:08:19,020 --> 04:08:21,020
but I still need to get up there

2308
04:08:21,020 --> 04:08:23,020
to see it

2309
04:08:23,020 --> 04:08:25,020
I remember

2310
04:08:25,020 --> 04:08:27,020
I remember, I remember

2311
04:08:27,020 --> 04:08:29,020
but I don't remember

2312
04:08:31,020 --> 04:08:33,020
I don't remember

2313
04:08:33,020 --> 04:08:35,020
what I did to get there

2314
04:08:36,020 --> 04:08:38,020
what did I do?

2315
04:08:38,020 --> 04:08:40,020
what did I get?

2316
04:08:40,020 --> 04:08:42,020
I picked up something

2317
04:08:42,020 --> 04:08:44,020
but where?

2318
04:08:44,020 --> 04:08:46,020
what did I pick up?

2319
04:08:46,020 --> 04:08:48,020
I picked up a crowbar or some stuff

2320
04:08:48,020 --> 04:08:50,020
some stuff

2321
04:08:50,020 --> 04:08:52,020
but where did I pick it up?

2322
04:08:52,020 --> 04:08:54,020
I don't remember

2323
04:08:54,020 --> 04:08:56,020
I don't remember

2324
04:09:00,020 --> 04:09:02,020
it was like some sort of stick

2325
04:09:02,020 --> 04:09:04,020
I found a stick somewhere

2326
04:09:11,020 --> 04:09:13,020
was it up here?

2327
04:09:29,020 --> 04:09:31,020
oh I thought it was up there

2328
04:09:31,020 --> 04:09:33,020
it was up here

2329
04:09:41,020 --> 04:09:43,020

2339
04:10:12,020 --> 04:10:14,020

2340
04:10:14,020 --> 04:10:16,020

2341
04:10:16,020 --> 04:10:18,020

2342
04:10:18,020 --> 04:10:20,020
I got this

2343
04:10:22,020 --> 04:10:24,020
I got this

2344
04:10:24,020 --> 04:10:26,020

2345
04:10:28,020 --> 04:10:30,020

2346
04:10:30,020 --> 04:10:32,020

2347
04:10:32,020 --> 04:10:34,020
I need this

2348
04:10:34,020 --> 04:10:36,020

2349
04:10:36,020 --> 04:10:38,020

2379
04:12:28,020 --> 04:12:30,020
can't combine it

2380
04:12:30,020 --> 04:12:32,020
can't combine it

2381
04:12:39,020 --> 04:12:41,020
oh like this sorry

2382
04:12:41,020 --> 04:12:43,020
it lands out

2383
04:12:44,020 --> 04:12:46,020
let me take this

2384
04:12:46,020 --> 04:12:48,020
put it in there

2385
04:12:49,020 --> 04:12:51,020
let me take this

2386
04:12:53,020 --> 04:12:55,020
while it's at

2387
04:12:55,020 --> 04:12:57,020
yes

2388
04:12:57,020 --> 04:12:59,020
and then we uh

2389
04:13:01,020 --> 04:13:03,020
take this

2390
04:13:03,020 --> 04:13:05,020
go here

2391
04:13:19,020 --> 04:13:21,020
fine

2392
04:13:21,020 --> 04:13:23,020
fine

2393
04:13:23,020 --> 04:13:25,020
fine

2394
04:13:25,020 --> 04:13:27,020
fine

2395
04:13:30,020 --> 04:13:32,020
take that

2396
04:13:32,020 --> 04:13:34,020
I just get shocked I was already good

2397
04:13:34,020 --> 04:13:36,020
but I can't help myself

2398
04:13:40,020 --> 04:13:42,020
all the robots are not functional

2399
04:13:42,020 --> 04:13:44,020
I guess we did

2400
04:13:44,020 --> 04:13:46,020
we did

2401
04:13:46,020 --> 04:13:48,020
the computer

2402
04:13:48,020 --> 04:13:50,020
the green system is bad

2403
04:13:50,020 --> 04:13:52,020
I can't see what's in me

2404
04:13:52,020 --> 04:13:54,020
the computer doesn't do anything else

2405
04:13:54,020 --> 04:13:56,020
ok

2406
04:13:57,020 --> 04:13:59,020
this computer wasn't on last time right?

2407
04:14:01,020 --> 04:14:03,020
it was definitely not on last time

2408
04:14:17,020 --> 04:14:19,020
what's this

2409
04:14:27,020 --> 04:14:29,020
oh

2410
04:14:29,020 --> 04:14:31,020
the code is a little different

2411
04:14:31,020 --> 04:14:33,020
the code is different

2412
04:14:33,020 --> 04:14:35,020
than last time

2413
04:14:35,020 --> 04:14:38,020
so the code you guys gave me wouldn't have worked

2414
04:14:40,020 --> 04:14:42,020
it wouldn't have worked

2415
04:14:42,020 --> 04:14:44,020
wouldn't have worked

2416
04:14:44,020 --> 04:14:46,020
it would give you something else

2417
04:14:48,020 --> 04:14:50,020
like no cheating for you

2418
04:14:56,020 --> 04:14:58,020
ok

2419
04:15:00,020 --> 04:15:02,020
let me go all the way up here

2420
04:15:02,020 --> 04:15:04,020
and

2421
04:15:04,020 --> 04:15:06,020
grab this

2422
04:15:06,020 --> 04:15:08,020
I do

2423
04:15:08,020 --> 04:15:10,020
it was

2424
04:15:10,020 --> 04:15:12,020
8

2425
04:15:12,020 --> 04:15:14,020
4

2426
04:15:14,020 --> 04:15:16,020
7

2427
04:15:16,020 --> 04:15:18,020
4

2428
04:15:20,020 --> 04:15:22,020
well

2429
04:15:22,020 --> 04:15:24,020
wait

2430
04:15:24,020 --> 04:15:26,020
I don't remember saying that

2431
04:15:28,020 --> 04:15:30,020
I have something

2432
04:15:33,020 --> 04:15:35,020
really?

2433
04:15:35,020 --> 04:15:37,020
I don't know

2434
04:15:37,020 --> 04:15:39,020
don't worry about it

2435
04:15:39,020 --> 04:15:41,020
what's in the safe?

2436
04:15:41,020 --> 04:15:43,020
alright

2437
04:15:43,020 --> 04:15:45,020
let's see

2438
04:15:45,020 --> 04:15:47,020
now we got the gas mask

2439
04:15:48,020 --> 04:15:50,020
and

2440
04:15:54,020 --> 04:15:56,020
what is that

2441
04:15:57,020 --> 04:15:59,020
we don't have to worry about that

2442
04:15:59,020 --> 04:16:01,020
don't worry

2443
04:16:01,020 --> 04:16:03,020
let me go this way

2444
04:16:03,020 --> 04:16:05,020
go this way

2445
04:16:05,020 --> 04:16:07,020
I'm cooking

2446
04:16:07,020 --> 04:16:09,020
I'm cooking

2447
04:16:09,020 --> 04:16:11,020
ok

2448
04:16:12,020 --> 04:16:14,020
gas mask

2449
04:16:14,020 --> 04:16:16,020
gas mask

2450
04:16:16,020 --> 04:16:18,020
at least we found the gas mask

2451
04:16:18,020 --> 04:16:20,020
let me go this way

2452
04:16:24,020 --> 04:16:26,020
ok

2453
04:16:38,020 --> 04:16:40,020
I don't know

2454
04:16:40,020 --> 04:16:42,020
this was

2455
04:16:42,020 --> 04:16:44,020
this is building

2456
04:16:44,020 --> 04:16:46,020
I can't see

2457
04:16:49,020 --> 04:16:51,020
can I see behind it

2458
04:16:52,020 --> 04:16:54,020
119

2459
04:16:54,020 --> 04:16:56,020
119

2460
04:16:56,020 --> 04:16:58,020
is

2461
04:16:59,020 --> 04:17:01,020
I think

2462
04:17:02,020 --> 04:17:04,020
was this robot housing

2463
04:17:04,020 --> 04:17:06,020
119

2464
04:17:06,020 --> 04:17:08,020
has robot

2465
04:17:10,020 --> 04:17:12,020
or the guardian

2466
04:17:12,020 --> 04:17:14,020
guardians

2467
04:17:14,020 --> 04:17:16,020
I don't think robots can go inside there

2468
04:17:16,020 --> 04:17:18,020
what building is this

2469
04:17:21,020 --> 04:17:23,020
I think robots can

2470
04:17:23,020 --> 04:17:25,020
another housing unit

2471
04:17:25,020 --> 04:17:27,020
what building is this

2472
04:17:27,020 --> 04:17:29,020
113

2473
04:17:29,020 --> 04:17:31,020
these robots robots

2474
04:17:31,020 --> 04:17:33,020
robots robots

2475
04:17:38,020 --> 04:17:40,020

2490
04:18:17,020 --> 04:18:19,020
almost 17

2491
04:18:20,020 --> 04:18:22,020
another housing unit

2492
04:18:27,020 --> 04:18:29,020
this one doesn't have robots in it

2493
04:18:29,020 --> 04:18:31,020
this one is empty

2494
04:18:31,020 --> 04:18:33,020
is it humans?

2495
04:18:33,020 --> 04:18:35,020
regular housing?

2496
04:18:35,020 --> 04:18:37,020
so long 17 is housing

2497
04:18:37,020 --> 04:18:39,020
are there any more to this

2498
04:18:40,020 --> 04:18:42,020

2501
04:18:49,020 --> 04:18:51,020
this one is also regular housing

2502
04:18:51,020 --> 04:18:53,020
what one is this

2503
04:19:01,020 --> 04:19:03,020
1110

2504
04:19:03,020 --> 04:19:05,020
1110 is regular housing

2505
04:19:05,020 --> 04:19:07,020
1110 is regular housing

2506
04:19:08,020 --> 04:19:10,020
1117 is regular housing

2507
04:19:15,020 --> 04:19:17,020
12 is medical

2508
04:19:20,020 --> 04:19:22,020
16

2509
04:19:26,020 --> 04:19:28,020
station robot

2510
04:19:28,020 --> 04:19:30,020
I think this is a robot

2511
04:19:30,020 --> 04:19:32,020
station robot

2512
04:19:32,020 --> 04:19:34,020
but there is no machine

2513
04:19:34,020 --> 04:19:36,020
so 18 is either housing or robot

2514
04:19:40,020 --> 04:19:42,020
13 is

2515
04:19:49,020 --> 04:19:51,020
housing
