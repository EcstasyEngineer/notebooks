1787560	1815560	And they have a limit, a cap limit of how much they can give you over the counter, the cap limit was 200 IU 200 200 can have any more than that, you know how do you know how much she gave me, can you guess how much IU she gave me IU caps she gave me for each cap.
1817560	1844560	It's over 9000. How could this be?
1845560	1846560	Sorry.
1855560	1859560	He triggered a memory. That chatter triggered a memory. I'm sorry.
1859560	1882560	Is that it? Is that everyone's guesses? 400, 500, 400, 500, 1,000, 500, 5, 100, 5,000.
1890560	1892560	Is that all your guesses?
1895560	1900560	Alright, so what they prescribed me was actually 50,000.
1904560	1908560	50,000 IU. 50,000.
1919560	1929560	50,000 IU.
1930560	1935560	I feel like alive, right? Yeah, I'm alive. I'm okay.
1936560	1942560	I have to take one every week. One cap a week.
1943560	1951560	And I keep forgetting to take it. I suppose I took it on Friday on Friday, but I forgot.
1954560	1961560	Friday passed and I was like, did I take this? I saw it sitting behind my TV and I'm like, did I take that?
1964560	1967560	I'm like, no, I did not. I definitely did not.
1967560	1980560	Yeah, every Friday I was supposed to take it. Now it's every Sunday now since I took it before I started the stream.
1980560	2002560	Is there ever a bone marrow transplant? No. I hear it hurts and I hear you have to be awake for it.
2003560	2005560	It sounds terrifying.
2010560	2012560	It sounds scary.
2015560	2018560	It's over 9,000 then literally.
2018560	2032560	Keep your phone always with you. My phone is always with me. It's right here.
2039560	2042560	It's right here. One second.

2071560	2078560	Yeah, that's how low. That's why you're not supposed to be in the single digits of your vitamins, especially vitamin D.
2078560	2095000	And I found out that low vitamin B count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.
2096000	2101000	I found out.
2101000	2108000	I didn't know that.
2108000	2118000	I found out that low vitamin B count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.
2118000	2128000	I found out that low vitamin B count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.

2148000	2158000	I found out that low vitamin D count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.
2158000	2170000	I found out that low vitamin D count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.
2189000	2194000	Help me! Help me!
2194000	2200000	Help me!
2224000	2230000	My calcium levels most likely very very low.
2254000	2260000	My calcium levels most likely very low.
2284000	2291000	My calcium levels most likely very low.
2314000	2320000	My calcium levels most likely very low.
2344000	2350000	My calcium levels most likely very low.
2375000	2381000	Well now you guys get to hear it though because I fixed my, I officially fixed my mic settings.
2381000	2386000	I'm so happy. I think I mentioned this yesterday. I'm so happy.
2386000	2390000	Every time I went high pitch my microphone went and pick it up.
2390000	2394000	But I think my microphone can now pick it up.
2394000	2399000	I think I'm good. I'm good for now.
2405000	2412000	So now you can hear all my ranges because my microphone before couldn't pick up my laugh.
2412000	2417000	I bet you guys still don't even really know what my real laugh is like.
2417000	2431000	My real life is my, my, my, well I mean they're all my real laughs but I guess when I really laugh really really hard it goes up really really really high.
2432000	2439000	If I laugh really really really hard my laugh becomes extremely high pitched.
2439000	2447000	Thus my mic doesn't pick it up. Thus it sounds like I'm not responding to people but I'm busy laughing.
2447000	2456000	So you can never hear it. All my previous streams whenever I laughed my microphone couldn't pick it up.
2462000	2466000	No you don't want to hear that. You don't want to hear that.
2466000	2469000	You don't want to hear that.
2492000	2499000	You didn't turn up great. I'm so happy. I hope my microphone sounds okay.
2499000	2507000	I feel like I could do a little better. I feel like if I cut out or dip or anything just let me know.
2507000	2513000	I can easily fix it. Let me know. Let me know.
2521000	2526000	You want a highest note? I could say Ara Ara.
2526000	2530000	And then a lowest note.
2532000	2538000	You really need to hear it. My laugh.
2538000	2551000	Quick so I'll make her laugh. Like a submarine radar.
2551000	2557000	I wheeze when I laugh too hard. I snort when I laugh too hard.
2557000	2562000	Or when something catches me off guard. I snort.
2563000	2571000	It's brown and sticky.
2575000	2581000	Poop. Poop. Poop is brown and sticky.
2581000	2585000	Poop. Poop-o.
2592000	2596000	Poop. Poop.
2596000	2599000	Poop. Poop. Poop.
2599000	2602000	Poop. Poop. Poop.
2602000	2606000	Poop. Poop. Poop.
2606000	2609000	Poop. Poop. Poop.
2612000	2616000	I'm sorry. I didn't like that emo.
2616000	2622000	I like the red face emo a lot.
2647000	2672000	I don't know why I like trolling and then feeling as if I annoyed you so much and then this face pops up.
2673000	2678000	It makes me laugh.
2678000	2682000	I laugh every time I lose connection and you guys use this face.
2682000	2688000	I laugh the entire time. It's so funny.
2688000	2693000	It's so hilarious.
2693000	2698000	I love that face so much.
2702000	2714000	I think the only time I snorted was when I tripped the robot in stray.
2732000	2737000	It's so funny.
2751000	2756000	My side hurts.
2763000	2774000	I'd rather you guys show disappointment in my stupid jokes.
2774000	2776000	Is that weird?
2776000	2778000	Is that weird? Am I weird for that?
2778000	2780000	Is that a weird thing?
2780000	2782000	Is that weird?
2783000	2786000	If you guys laugh, I'm like, that wasn't funny.
2786000	2788000	Why are you laughing?
2792000	2802000	But I take great pleasure when you are all disappointed in my dumb jokes.
2823000	2827000	Help, I can't stop laughing.
2830000	2835000	Am I an M? I don't know. I don't know. I don't think so.
2835000	2838000	I don't know. Maybe to an extent.
2838000	2842000	Any further than that, I'll probably get upset.
2842000	2844000	I'll probably get a little ingy.
2844000	2847000	I don't think I'm an M.
2853000	2856000	Is it levels for you?
2856000	2858000	Yeah, it's levels for me.
2858000	2860000	To a great extent.
2863000	2865000	She just likes being annoying.
2865000	2867000	I do. I really do.
2869000	2871000	I do like being annoying.
2874000	2876000	I take great pleasure in it.
2876000	2881000	Seeing the disdain on your face from my stupidity.
2883000	2885000	Is that so bad?
2889000	2891000	Just straight disdain.
2898000	2899000	You're supposed to comfort.
2899000	2902000	I do. I comfort you after I annoy you.
2903000	2908000	After I tease and annoy you, I comfort you after.
2913000	2916000	Oh, was it?
2919000	2921000	Glad you enjoyed it.
2932000	2934000	Is that a type of aftercare?
2934000	2936000	Yeah, of course.
2943000	2946000	It's got the zoomies.
2946000	2948000	I did drink with some soda.
2948000	2950000	So I have a lot of sugar in me right now.
2953000	2955000	I just cracked my thumbs.
2973000	2976000	Why did the bike fall over?
2987000	2990000	The only reason why that made me laugh
2990000	2993000	is because I fell off the bike.
2993000	2995000	The only reason why that made me laugh
2995000	2997000	is because I fell off the bike.
2997000	3000000	The only reason why that made me laugh
3000000	3002000	is because I fell off the bike.
3031000	3033000	How do you crack your thumbs?
3033000	3035000	Oh, I pull them.
3035000	3037000	I pull them or accidentally bend them.
3037000	3039000	I bend them accidently.
3039000	3041000	Like I put my hand on the table.
3041000	3044000	And if my thumb is folded in front of my palm,
3044000	3046000	like in front of the hand,
3046000	3048000	and then I put my hand down,
3048000	3050000	it cracks.
3050000	3052000	I gotta do that.
3053000	3055000	This doesn't look like a supermarket.
3055000	3057000	We're getting there.
3057000	3059000	We're gonna be in the supermarket.
3059000	3061000	God, this is great, fine.
3061000	3063000	Let's get on over in the supermarket.
3063000	3065000	We're gonna run out of supermarket.
3065000	3067000	God, you're so impatient.
3067000	3069000	You don't want to even want to talk to me.
3069000	3071000	Whatever.
3071000	3073000	Fine.
3073000	3075000	We won't.

4447740	4457740	Really, thank you so much for the red. How was your stream? What did you play?
4457740	4460740	Welcome in.
4460740	4480740	It's very nice to meet all of you. My name is Azur Dulay. If you haven't already heard of me, I am your fertility goddess from Bialor.
4480740	4484740	Welcome in.
4484740	4490740	So if you need to go rest, rain, I appreciate it.
4490740	4504740	I understand that if you have to rain and go, go eat, rest, drink water, eat food. Thank you so much.
4504740	4510740	It was fun. I see you're getting milk.
4510740	4515740	I'm more like selling my milk.
4515740	4520740	If you would like to purchase some, you can purchase some.
4520740	4530740	I can give you a discount.
4530740	4539740	Now water is important. Why is water important? Are you thirsty?
4539740	4552740	I give cute girl discount.
4569740	4593740	You'll get your turn chat. You'll get your turn. You'll get your little discount as well.
4593740	4612740	Eventually. What a goddess gotta do, what a goddess gotta do. Just gotta make some money.
4612740	4622740	It's over.
4622740	4630740	$100?
4630740	4644740	He looks suspicious. I won't question anything.
4644740	4656740	$200 for $299.
4656740	4665740	Am I in it? I am.
4665740	4679740	$199.
4679740	4705740	Why does this FBI agent keep coming into my store? He's scary. He's scaring me. What does he need flour for?
4705740	4710740	He's watching me.
4710740	4714740	He took sprints out. Did you get the milk out, Leia?
4714740	4717740	I am.
4717740	4727740	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, you too. Milk and cheese, I see how it is.
4727740	4738740	Oh, it's you again. Hi.
4738740	4743740	I really like that tank top.
4743740	4755740	Oh, thank you.
4755740	4765740	Will you sell cereal too? Do you really want cereal with your milk? You want cereal, you just don't want my milk alone. Do you want cereal?
4765740	4771740	Here, I will avoid a pole.
4771740	4780740	And cereal.
4780740	4807740	Is that it? Anyone else?
4807740	4831740	My ear is ringing. Oh my god.
4831740	4842740	cereal is called Chucky Pig.
4842740	4851740	It looks like graham crackers in the shape of a bear.
4851740	4865740	Chocolate flavor.
4865740	4873740	Chocolate cereal with chocolate milk.
4873740	4894740	You don't have chocolate powder, but it comes from a chocolate goat.
4894740	4906740	Let me turn this off.
4906740	4912740	Is this okay? Can you hear me?
4912740	4920740	Can you hear me?
4920740	4929740	Yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4929740	4933740	I keep going back here.
4933740	4939740	Because you love it here, that's why. You love it here.
4939740	4947740	You love it here. You're obsessed with me.
4947740	4955740	You need me. Just like how I need you.
4955740	4960740	Yes?
4960740	4968740	Glad. Yay. Hey, can you hear me?
4968740	4973740	Let you go?
4973740	4986740	You think I have a hold on you? I don't have to do anything. All I have to do is talk sweet nothings into your ear and you'll be back.
4986740	4998740	You'll be back.
4998740	5003740	I'll give you free reign.
5003740	5018740	All of you are already mine. You already belong to me. What do I need to fight for?
5018740	5031740	You don't want your goddess?
5031740	5040740	Can't get over chocolate. Have you eaten cocoa puffs? I have. I'm not a big fan of cocoa puffs though.
5040740	5045740	I do like Reese's puffs.
5045740	5050740	Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs.
5050740	5053740	I've been about a chocolate famous.
5053740	5063740	Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs.
5063740	5069740	I can't watch the homies now. I keep coming back here.
5069740	5074740	I'm sure the homies will understand.
5074740	5090740	They might make fun of you and then they'll be back in here too.
5090740	5097740	Cherry goat cinnamon goat crunch.
5097740	5102740	Goat goat puffs.
5102740	5107740	I like that a lot. Someone needs to draw those.
5107740	5119740	My own personal cereal. Special cereal that you can eat with my milk.
5119740	5127740	But my favorite cereal is actually Captain Crunch.
5127740	5132740	I burnt that up last time.
5132740	5139740	It's Captain Crunch. Favorite flavor is peanut butter.
5139740	5147740	Peanut butter. Captain Crunch. It's so good. I'll eat it without milk.
5148740	5156740	Just be careful with the roof of your mouth.
5156740	5175740	Captain Crunch will destroy it. Absolutely destroy it.
5175740	5181740	Lord in by the milk held by the siren voice.
5181740	5184740	You like it?
5184740	5190740	I mean, I can get even deeper into your ear.
5190740	5195740	I can take over your mind.
5195740	5198740	But I don't have hypnosis.
5198740	5208740	I can't do something like what the siren can do.
5208740	5218740	Hypnosis is the milk.
5218740	5223740	Who told you this?
5223740	5227740	You're not supposed to know.
5228740	5235740	Ow! My cup hit my tooth.
5245740	5249740	Now I have to eat you.
5258740	5270740	I like all of Captain Crunch cereal.
5270740	5276740	But my favorite cereal out of the Captain Crunch is probably the peanut butter.
5276740	5283740	But I do mix it. Mix it up. Mix it up. Mix it up.
5288740	5293740	I'm so excited for more. I hope you can tell about it.
5293740	5299740	We're going to be doing... Oh, I forgot to... I completely forgot to release that.
5299740	5305740	I completely forgot. I'll do it after the stream.
5305740	5310740	I completely forgot to release my schedule.
5310740	5316740	Oopsie. You have to not cross my mind.
5317740	5343740	I don't know what to do with you.
5343740	5349740	I don't know what to do with you.
5349740	5356740	I'm such a good streamer.
5356740	5370740	I don't know what to do with you.
5370740	5375740	I look a bit scuffed. No!
5375740	5382740	It's anything but the scuff.
5382740	5386740	Why?
5386740	5392740	I have a special ingredient to make my milk. Do you want to know what it is?
5392740	5399740	Do you want to know? Do you want to know what it is?

5792880	5794880	Do it for the milk.
5804880	5807880	Oh, do you actually want to know an actual educational...
5807880	5811880	an actual educational thing, though?
5813880	5815880	Jokes aside.
5819880	5821880	Jokes aside.
5827880	5829880	Well, you see,
5829880	5833880	when women give birth, right?
5835880	5837880	And they breastfeed.
5839880	5842880	And there was a lady who...
5842880	5844880	who pumps her...
5844880	5846880	she pumps her breast milk.
5846880	5848880	She pumps it.
5849880	5853880	And she was really scared that it...
5853880	5856880	she was really confused of why I kept turning pink,
5856880	5858880	like strawberry milk.
5859880	5861880	It's actually...
5861880	5864880	we can actually produce strawberry milk.
5864880	5866880	It's actually possible.
5866880	5869880	The reason for that is because
5869880	5873880	a tiny bit of blood
5873880	5875880	gets into the...
5875880	5877880	into the breast milk.
5877880	5879880	A tiny bit of blood.
5879880	5881880	So...
5883880	5885880	This is actually true.
5885880	5887880	This is a true fact.
5887880	5889880	Don't...
5889880	5891880	Just look it up. Google it.
5891880	5893880	Google it.
5893880	5895880	You see?
5895880	5897880	I could have been...
5897880	5899880	I could have been...
5900880	5902880	It's true.
5909880	5911880	That's not true, Raymond.
5911880	5913880	Like that.
5924880	5927880	Did it taste like strawberry, though?
5927880	5929880	I mean, it can.
5929880	5932880	Sometimes it tastes a little sweet.
5934880	5936880	Like it happens, too.
5937880	5940880	Like it's 100% happened where it tastes sweet.
5940880	5943880	After all, you are still drinking milk.
5948880	5950880	I think it depends on her diet.
5950880	5953880	On her diet as well, so...
5959880	5962880	Blood milk and strawberry milk.
5962880	5964880	Strawberry milk.
5973880	5975880	I see.
5975880	5977880	I see.
5978880	5980880	Google it. Google it.
5980880	5982880	It's true. It can happen.
5987880	5990880	He cursed strawberry milk.
5992880	5994880	Mmm.
6004880	6006880	Four.
6006880	6008880	Two.
6010880	6012880	You know, if it wasn't for machines...
6014880	6017880	I wouldn't be able to do math.
6023880	6026880	Math is hard.
6030880	6032880	Is it your blood?
6032880	6034880	Is it?
6034880	6036880	Is it my blood?
6036880	6039880	I mean, it could be.
6042880	6046880	But sacrifices are needed.
6052880	6055880	But is my blood red, though?
6056880	6058880	Is my blood red?
6058880	6060880	What if my blood is golden?
6062880	6064880	Are you sure it's my blood?
6064880	6067880	Have you ever seen a goddess bleed?
6070880	6073880	Have you ever seen a goddess bleed?
6077880	6080880	Have you ever seen a goddess bleed?
6082880	6084880	Tell me.
6096880	6098880	What if it's acidic like an alien?
6098880	6100880	Am I an alien?
6100880	6102880	Am I an alien?
6104880	6106880	Am I an alien now?
6113880	6115880	No. Give that back.
6127880	6130880	To expender. To expender.
6130880	6132880	To expender.
6142880	6144880	Is that it?
6144880	6146880	I was only seven?
6156880	6158880	I have cereal.
6166880	6168880	Two.
6173880	6176880	Do you think he's gonna get away with it?
6178880	6180880	Haha, you didn't get away with it.
6180880	6182880	You thought you could try to grab it before I take the prize.
6182880	6184880	You thought you could try to grab it before I take the prize.
6184880	6186880	You thought you could try to grab it before I take the prize.
6186880	6188880	Get off!
6202880	6204880	Yeah, that's right.
6204880	6206880	Yeah, that's right.
6206880	6208880	Yeah, that's right.
6208880	6210880	Yeah, that's right.
6210880	6212880	I'm gonna buy my cereal.
6212880	6214880	Mm-hmm.
6218880	6220880	Yeah.
6242880	6244880	They're goddess.
6244880	6246880	So don't be scared.
6246880	6248880	Don't be scared.
6265880	6267880	It's illial.
6267880	6270880	It's illial.
6273880	6275880	What a friend.
6280880	6282880	Consent is sexy.
6282880	6284880	Sometimes.
6287880	6289880	Very sexy.
6296880	6298880	Huh? What? What?
6298880	6300880	What happened? What happened?
6301880	6303880	Huh? What?
6303880	6305880	Mm-hmm.
6305880	6307880	What?
6330880	6333880	The area of cereal for the milk.
6333880	6335880	Is it healthy?
6341880	6343880	Cereal for the milk.
6360880	6362880	Mm-hmm.
6374880	6376880	This is no cup.
6376880	6378880	What do you mean?
6383880	6385880	Yes, eight dollars for the cereal.
6385880	6387880	Why? Because look.
6387880	6388880	Look, look.
6388880	6390880	It says market price.
6390880	6393880	Market price is six dollars and sixty-two cents.
6393880	6395880	We gotta make a little more than that, you know?
6395880	6398880	So it's wise to make it a dollar more.
6398880	6400880	A dollar or two dollars more.
6400880	6403880	I mean, we're looking at the market price.
6403880	6405880	Fuck this price. Whatever this is.
6405880	6407880	We're looking at this.
6409880	6411880	This is what it sells for.
6411880	6413880	So we do a little more than that.
6414880	6417880	Otherwise, I'd be making no money.
6418880	6420880	I'd be broke.
6421880	6423880	I'm gonna be a broke-go.
6425880	6428880	You want me to be a broke-go to you?
6429880	6431880	I believe you're getting crazy.
6443880	6446880	I broke God's hands from earlier.
6473880	6475880	I...
6480880	6482880	I...
6486880	6488880	Boat for the milk.
6488880	6492880	Milk for the cereal. The internal cycle of a syrup.
6492880	6505880	You're mistaking market price and cost.
6505880	6507880	We're not paying attention to this.
6507880	6509880	This is nothing.
6510880	6512880	What do you mean? Mistaking?
6513880	6515880	They're still buying it, aren't they?
6515880	6517880	Aren't they?
6518880	6520880	They're still buying it.
6521880	6524880	I see no problems here.
6525880	6527880	They're still buying it.
6529880	6532880	If they had a problem, they wouldn't be buying it.
6540880	6542880	Are you going to the next day?
6542880	6544880	Oh, right. Enter.
6550880	6552880	Okay.
6561880	6565880	So we have bread, we have milk, we have cheese.
6570880	6572880	What else do we need?
6574880	6578880	We need $550 to unlock.
6579880	6582880	Oh, the special milk.
6582880	6584880	Special milk.
6584880	6586880	The fresher kind of milk.
6586880	6588880	We need this.
6588880	6590880	That one right there.
6591880	6593880	Extremely fresh.
6593880	6595880	Delicious.
6595880	6597880	Delicious? Delicious.
6598880	6600880	Delicious milk.
6601880	6603880	Delicious.
6603880	6605880	Delish.
6605880	6608880	Straight from the top.
6608880	6611880	It's the milk that you can leave on the counter.
6612880	6614880	Right after.
6616880	6618880	Purchase.
6618880	6620880	We need this one.
6623880	6625880	Do we have to buy this?
6625880	6629880	Like in order to buy this?
6629880	6631880	Do we have to buy this?
6635880	6637880	What else do we need?
6637880	6639880	Salt and rice.
6639880	6641880	Oh, I like rice though.
6643880	6645880	We don't need all of these.
6645880	6647880	We don't need any of these.
6647880	6653880	We don't need the salt, peanut butter, flour, olive oils, pasta, rice and salt.
6653880	6655880	What we need is milk.
6655880	6657880	We need more milk.
6657880	6659880	We want this right there.
6659880	6661880	We want milk and we want yogurt.
6661880	6663880	More cereal.
6663880	6665880	Milk, yogurt.
6665880	6667880	Oh, cakes.
6667880	6669880	Cakes.
6669880	6671880	Yeah, there's different levels to milk.
6671880	6673880	There's processed milk.
6673880	6675880	Like after they take the milk from me.
6699880	6701880	I got you little lambs.
6705880	6707880	Little lambs.
6707880	6709880	Thank you so much for the $1.

6759880	6763880	The hallucinogens you put in the milk is working mama.
6763880	6765880	Now we just got to sacrifice them.

7988900	7995900	Are you sure about that?
8004900	8014900	You won't melt, you won't melt.
8014900	8019900	Just a little, you refuse to fold, huh?
8019900	8025900	I see, I see.
8026900	8037900	A little baby boy scared, scared to accept your fate.
8037900	8054900	Your loyalty should not bound, you cannot escape this goddess.
8054900	8060900	Are you sure you want someone as useless as you?
8060900	8072900	Your uselessness means nothing, because you are already of use to me, as long as I have your heart.
8072900	8089900	Everything I ever wanted, each and every one of you.
8089900	8101900	A piece for the phabias.
8101900	8116900	I can't give you all a piece, did you forget that I can get really, really big?
8116900	8124900	The bigger I can get, the more of you I can hold.
8131900	8160900	Ah, so cute.
8160900	8189900	You are all my precious little babies.
8189900	8193900	And nothing can take that away.
8193900	8206900	The only one that gets in your way is yourself, and all you have to do is let it go and accept your fate.
8220900	8227900	What are you scared of?
8227900	8229900	There's nothing to be afraid of.
8229900	8236900	Mommy's here, mommy's got you, mommy's going to hold you.
8249900	8272900	Yes, yes, I'll piece for the phabias.
8272900	8293900	Melgue's for the phabias.
8293900	8312900	Arra, ara.
8312900	8315900	Your soothing voice helps me keep going.
8315900	8320900	You are the sweetest woman in your generation and a blessing for a man's mental health.
8320900	8323900	Thank you Azura.
8323900	8332900	Wow, it's so sweet of you to say anonymous. Thank you for the $1 to happy. Thank you.
8332900	8361900	So sweet.
8361900	8376900	Oh, I have to sneeze.
8376900	8382900	Oh my gosh, my eyes are watery.
8383900	8387900	Don't die, don't die.
8387900	8392900	Thank you for the $3 to happy.
8392900	8397900	Thank you, thank you.
8397900	8402900	Don't die, you must live, you must survive.
8402900	8406900	I'm a survivor, I wanna make it.
8406900	8422900	I'm a survivor, keep on surviving.
8422900	8439900	Thank you for the blessures.
8439900	8467900	Is that Leopold?
8468900	8477900	I want to keep listening to you, but I need to go to sleep for work tomorrow. So conflicting. May I get a hug and kiss goodnight mommy?
8477900	8495900	Thank you so much for the $1 to happy. I'm the late lover. Here's your hug.
8495900	8514900	Good night.
8514900	8525900	Do I kill you guys? Chat time.
8525900	8534900	They're dead, they're dead.
8544900	8567900	Thank you for the $1 to happy.
8567900	8586900	It was my mouth, but I stood tall. I can wonder what other things are standing tall.
8586900	8614900	Thank you for the $1 to happy.
8614900	8625900	Thank you for the $1 to happy.
8625900	8648900	Oh that's so bright, oh my eyeballs.
8648900	8658900	Okay, I wanna see if I can buy that thing now or buy any level 9.
8678900	8697900	I don't trust it. I feel like I'm playing Pokemon all over again. You know, when the game crashes, so you're so scared of your process being lost and when you play Pokemon on the DS, so you save it every 2 minutes.
8697900	8716900	That's what I feel like right now.
8716900	8735900	Because there's no warning when it crashes or anything, it just closes the game. That's it, just close. I've boop, gone.
8735900	8752900	Better channel doesn't have our ASMRs. Well, yeah, it's unfortunate. I only had one ASMR though. I believe next week I'll be having another ASMR, but I think it's gonna be called ASMR.
8752900	8764900	If you understand my grip, we gotta be more safe with the thickness that we do on here.
8764900	8780900	Yeah, yeah, yeah, see, yeah, see, yeah.
8794900	8820900	Oh, she scared me. She scared me so bad. I don't think anyone else is gonna come in here. Yeah, she, yeah.
8820900	8842900	Big toe.
8842900	8855900	Anyone else? Nobody else? Anybody else wanna come in here? Anybody else? Nobody else? Ah, see? Alright, I see all this.
8855900	8872900	And I closed door. Yay! And now it saves, right? I don't see it.
8872900	8891900	We're like barely making any money with our milk.
8891900	8910900	It stays.
8910900	8939900	I hear. Oh. Since whole yapping. This goat mafia you see. I'm hungry. I wanna eat. I wanna eat food.
8940900	8964900	Yeah, no more cookie eating for the ASMR.
8964900	8993900	Nope. No toast today. Instead, I'm going to eat weyanya. Weyanya. I'm going to eat weyanya.
8994900	9010900	Weyanya. Weyanya.
9010900	9034900	FBI agents coming to have a taste of my milk. It's definitely chocolate.
9035900	9051900	Why are there so many FBI agents in here?
9051900	9070900	I hear the rumors about your strawberry milk. Hey.
9070900	9087900	We just use a little bit of powder. A little bit of powder, you know?
9100900	9129900	Can I hire someone to register? Is that possible? Oh, hiring.
9130900	9147900	Aww. No, good to see you.
9160900	9189900	How about we make this the last night and then we just sit and chat? Sit and chat. Sit and chat for a little bit.
9190900	9209900	But I do want to eat.
9220900	9249900	Oh, we already had a bread in cereal.
9280900	9309900	Mmm. I'll take the goat milk entire stock and production and factory all together. It'll cost you.
9310900	9323900	I don't think you'd have enough to sacrifice to own all of it, now would you? It might cost you more than an arm and a leg.
9323900	9352900	Maybe your entire heart?
9353900	9379900	How's the stream going? Really well. I'm enjoying myself. Very much so. Oh, thank God that was empty. Oh, my goodness.
9379900	9392900	Oh, my goodness. Thank goodness that cup was empty.
9392900	9407900	That was close. Anyone else? Anybody else?
9407900	9428900	I'm going to save it for the next day. Save it just in case.
9437900	9456900	I hear.
9456900	9479900	Where's your timer for the mess?
9479900	9494900	Do you think goat mom could crush chat if she wanted to? Yes, she can.
9495900	9505900	And you'd perish. But would I? No, I wouldn't do that. Why?
9505900	9520900	Because I need you. I need you. Just like how you need me. I need you.
9520900	9535900	Well, it's with little babies. How else am I supposed to breed?
9550900	9579900	How are the tables turned?
9579900	9586900	What do you mean?
9586900	9593900	Alright, let me grab me my food and I'll be right back.
9593900	9601900	Play some sports with each other while I go be right back. Alright, I'm gonna be right back.
9601900	9608900	I have this pretty screen.
9691900	9706900	I have this pretty screen.
9706900	9721900	I have this pretty screen.
9721900	9736900	I have this pretty screen.
9736900	9751900	I have this pretty screen.
9751900	9766900	I have this pretty screen.
9766900	9790900	I have this pretty screen.
9790900	9808900	I'm looking at all of you playing all sports.
9809900	9817900	I'm back.
9817900	9823900	I have lasagna.
9838900	9859900	I'm very good. I'm proud of you.
9859900	9869900	Are you guys eating? I hope you all are eating.
9869900	9879900	If you can't eat right now, I'll help you eat later.
9879900	9892900	I need drinks. I still have the soda left over.
9892900	9903900	Am I peaking?
9903900	9911900	Is that better? Oh no. That's not what happened.
9911900	9938900	That's not what happened at all. I know why I'm peaking. Every time I move my keyboard and my keyboard accidentally hits one of my equipment and turns the knob up or down.
9938900	9949900	Oh my god, it was at 80. I am so sorry.
9949900	9956900	Oh my god.
9956900	9967900	My keyboard keeps hitting the knob and turns it up and I have to keep looking out for that. I moved my keyboard out of the way so I could put my plate down.
9967900	9982900	Is that better? I'm so sorry about that.
9982900	9988900	It scared me.
9988900	9995900	It's fine. My ears are yours. I don't want your ears to be destroyed.
9995900	10011900	If your ears get destroyed, how else are you going to listen to me? You'll be sad. You won't be able to hear my voice anymore.
10011900	10017900	You'll go crazy. You'll lose your mind.
10017900	10028900	Do you know how? Because you already got a taste of what my voice already sounds like. You like my voice. You love it. You will be hearing it.
10028900	10042900	You wait for my streams. Even when I'm gone, you think about my voice. When I stream, you're happy. You like my voice. My voice is there. It's in your ears. You want to hear more.
10042900	10055900	One day, you lose your hearing. You can't hear anymore. You can't hear. But you want to hear my voice. But you can't hear.
10055900	10072900	Now you have the thought of what you used to know. All you can do is remember the voice in your head. My voice in your head. You think about it. About what you could do to hear my voice again.
10072900	10082900	You do anything. Anything. You want to hear my voice. You want to hear my voice. You're losing your mind.
10082900	10107900	You need to hear my voice. You have to hear my voice. Days go by. You're starting to forget. You're starting to forget. What my voice sounds like. You're gonna forget. You don't want to forget. You want to hear my voice. You want to hear my voice. You're losing your mind. You're going crazy. You want to hear my voice.
10112900	10122900	Is that what you want to do? Is that what you want to go through?
10142900	10160900	If you don't want that, take care of your ears. Tell me if my volume peaks. Tell me if it goes low. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience.
10172900	10173900	If you don't want that, take care of your ears. Tell me if it goes low. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me.

Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's
10202900	10216580	the horror you want to experience.
10216580	10218580	There you go.
10224180	10227220	Help I'm a rock. Help I'm a rock.
10246580	10250420	I'm already kind of deaf in one ear.
10253300	10260420	That's all right. You have another ear. Another ear you'll need to take care of.
10276580	10292580	I'll do my best to let you know. Careful eating mama. Clearly that is just way too up.
10296580	10298580	I'll be careful.
10298580	10308580	I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube.
10328580	10348580	Did I post it yet? No I didn't post it yet. Excuse me. I can post it right now. Give me one second. I have to find it though.
10358580	10364580	One second please.
10388580	10396580	I sneezed. Thank you.
10418580	10438580	Let me grab this. My brain isn't braining right now.
10438580	10454580	My brain is kind of trying to remember where I put it but it's only in one place and I don't know why I can't remember that place.
10468580	10478580	I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube.
10498580	10508580	I'm in love with YouTube.
10528580	10538580	I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube.
10558580	10568580	I'm in love with YouTube.
10588580	10606580	I did it. Yay.
10606580	10616580	Do you want some Messiah? Open it up.
10636580	10652580	I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube.
10652580	10680580	Come on. You'd like it. You love it.
10682580	10702580	You'd eat it.
10702580	10722580	I'm a good girl. I'm the best girl.
10732580	10760580	I'm a good girl.
10762580	10772580	I'm a good girl. I'm a good girl.
10792580	10802580	Oh God.
10802580	10812580	I have a little square left. I've got to gather all of the crumbs together.
10812580	10820580	The last bite. The last bite.
10820580	10836580	It's pretty full of crumbs together.
10836580	10846580	Yeah.
10846580	10858580	Mmm.
10858580	10868580	What kind of lasagna was it?
10868580	10874580	Beef? Beef lasagna?
10874580	10884580	I don't know. It's homemade lasagna. I don't know.
10884580	10904580	I don't know about other kinds of lasagna.
10904580	10908580	I don't know. She's going to move on to us next.
10908580	10916580	Maybe.
10916580	10928580	Beef lasagna.
10928580	10934580	Move. Move. Move.
10934580	10960580	Move. Move.
10960580	10970580	How? How to do cow noise?
10970580	10998580	How is it?
10998580	11004580	I have really good at doing animal impressions. I never mentioned that in my debut.
11004580	11014580	Because that was embarrassed. I'm sorry.
11014580	11042580	But I get really loud when I do it.
11042580	11048580	I don't know how to whisper to it. It's not possible.
11048580	11054580	So just then that was probably extremely loud.
11054580	11060580	I probably woke up someone.
11060580	11070580	I don't know how to whisper. I have to use my entire vocal box to be able to do it.
11070580	11098580	For a girl, you're especially good at sounding like a cow.
11098580	11116580	How are you?
11116580	11122580	I'm too embarrassed to do any other sounds.
11122580	11128580	I'm so flustered. My face is burning. Oh my gosh.
11128580	11134580	I could do a duck. I could do a duck.
11134580	11144580	I could do chicken. I could do small birds.
11144580	11154580	I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it.
11154580	11162580	I didn't mention any of my impressions on debut because I knew I was going to get too embarrassed to do it.
11162580	11166580	Then I was going to do it and I was going to mess up on doing it.
11166580	11172580	Then I was going to be so embarrassed that I would want to perish.
11172580	11184580	I didn't add it at all.
11184580	11196580	Oh shit.
11196580	11210580	We're too loud. We're too loud. We're too loud.
11210580	11218580	Trying to do it and whisper is so hard.
11218580	11230580	It's so hard. How do you whisper and make noises?
11230580	11240580	Why? Don't tell him.
11240580	11258580	Don't tell him.
11258580	11272580	I can't do the rooster noise. The one that wakes you up in the morning because it's way too loud.
11272580	11280580	There's a quiet one. There you go.
11280580	11288580	How do you whisper? It's so hard.
11302580	11312580	No.
11312580	11322580	What a cute poem.
11322580	11344580	Look at that.
11344580	11356580	That one hurts.
11356580	11376580	I'm a kitty.
11376580	11398580	I'm a kitty.
11398580	11424580	We used to yell at each other all the time.
11424580	11428580	I miss him so much.
11428580	11446580	We just go back and forth doing that to each other.
11446580	11466580	I miss him so much.
11466580	11492580	Hello. Hi.
11492580	11504580	I didn't voice-act the cat and stray. The cat and stray is actually voice-acted and modeled after an actual cat.
11504580	11518580	And he is a cutie. Such a cutie. Did you see him?
11518580	11538580	I can never take the job of a real cat.
11538580	11554580	I was meat stuck in my teeth.
11554580	11564580	Did they hire cat voice actor? Not a real person but an actual cat.
11564580	11570580	Thanks we got a real cat and let him meow into a microphone.
11570580	11578580	I think it's the same cat that we also put the tape and stuff over.
11578580	11584580	And the cat walked around with the stuff all over it.
11584580	11588580	I liked the behind the scene video. It was very cute.
11588580	11610580	Have you guys seen the video of the cat doing the stuff for the game?
11610580	11636580	It's an actual kitty cat.
11636580	11644580	Sorry to serve. I'll show you.
11644580	11654580	Hi.
11674580	11686580	Oops.
11686580	11698580	Ignore that.
11698580	11726580	Yeah but how do I make it?
11726580	11742580	Is it lost? Work for me.
11742580	11758580	I can't do that. It's so dumb.
11758580	11768580	Close.
11768580	11782580	Again you are going to fight over us.
11782580	11786580	It's not what I want to move. It's not what I moved.
11786580	11792580	Work with me. Work with me.
11792580	11798580	Do you literally have the thingy up? It's not working.
11798580	11804580	I changed it. Why is it not working? What happened?
11804580	11812580	What the heck? What's happening? What can I...
11812580	11822580	No.
11822580	11828580	I did it. I'm so smart.
11828580	11838580	Let's go. I'm intelligent.
11838580	11846580	I'm so smart. Oh my god. You believe it how smart I am?
11846580	11854580	I'm so smart. Is this too small? Should I make it bigger?
11854580	11862580	Is this too small?
11862580	11870580	This is a kitty cat.
11870580	11874580	This is a cat that they have for the thingy. I don't even think you can hear it.
11874580	11886580	Hang on.
11886580	11898580	You can't hear it. I can't hear it.
11898580	11904580	Sorry. I heard myself. My apologies.
11904580	11918580	Ew. I heard myself.
11918580	11924580	How do I move it?
11924580	11926580	Can you hear it now?
11954580	11980580	Now there. I went through all that for a really short video.
11980580	12002580	Today we are group.
12002580	12010580	I can't really watch it alone.
12010580	12026580	I'd watch memes and videos with you guys.
12026580	12048580	I can't hear it.
12048580	12058580	The fat cat. Big chunkers.
12058580	12066580	Where the cats paid? I think the owners were paid.
12066580	12076580	I think the owners got paid for their kitty cat audition.
12076580	12096580	Maybe we can add that to a dono.
12096580	12100580	Where you guys submit your funniest memes to me.
12100580	12112580	I'll have someone go through them before sending them to me.
12112580	12120580	Just in case you guys send me something out of this world.
12120580	12130580	I don't trust you to be good but I don't trust all of you.
12130580	12152580	I don't trust you to be good but I don't trust all of you.
12152580	12164580	If I don't laugh at your memes don't take it the hard way right?
12164580	12170580	There's only so many things that can really make me laugh and my humor is kind of lost.
12170580	12180580	I laugh at the dumbest things and I really like people falling.
12180580	12190580	I don't know it's hard to explain. It's like a specific kind of funny.
12190580	12196580	It's like people get caught doing something they're not supposed to.
12196580	12214580	Other people laughing about it.
12214580	12218580	Caught lacking not me.
12218580	12228580	As long as they don't get seriously hurt is this fine with me.
12228580	12238580	As long as someone gets horrendously hurt or really badly hurt.
12238580	12248580	Make me go oof.
12248580	12251580	But every now and then it's fine.
12251580	12254580	You know how when you're like scrolling memes.
12254580	12260580	Scrolling the memes and you're scrolling and scrolling.
12260580	12270580	Ha ha hee hee every now and then and then you get hit with a random fall meme.
12270580	12280580	It gives you a good laugh.
12280580	12283580	Do you want to scroll through my tiktok?
12283580	12292580	Well if we scroll through tiktok it will be on the new account which I haven't really been on.

13337800	13343800	I am back.
13368800	13375800	I would never abandon you. Never. Never abandon you.
13376800	13383800	I would never abandon you. Never. Never.
13395800	13399800	It's okay, don't be scared. Mommy's back now.
13399800	13412800	You don't get the milk as broke. I give it to you every day. Are you ever gonna get tired of it?
13429800	13434800	No, I don't.
13459800	13466800	Never. Never. Never.
13466800	13472800	It won't leave again, right?
13472800	13477800	If I do leave, right?
13477800	13485800	It is only going to be for a little while. Only for a short while, yeah?
13486800	13493800	It's just a short while, and you guys can wait for me, right?
13493800	13498800	Mommy has to go every now and then.
13503800	13507800	Mommy has to.
13508800	13517800	Mommy is going to be gone for the next two days, and she'll be back. Don't worry.
13517800	13522800	Mommy will be back on Wednesday.
13522800	13527800	On Wednesday, you guys can wait till then, yes?
13538800	13543800	No.
13558800	13565800	Today is a period. There is no misery. You guys will be fine.
13565800	13576800	I am not abandoning you. Azra has things to do on those two days. Mondays and Tuesdays are very busy days for me.
13579800	13586800	Very busy days, and then you have me Wednesday all the way to Sunday.
13586800	13592800	So many things planned for you guys. So many things.
13595800	13605800	You're not getting abandoned. No one is getting abandoned.
13605800	13614800	Mommy is taking care of her health for you. If mommy doesn't take care of her health, there will be no mommy.
13614800	13622800	If mommy doesn't take care of her health, there will be no mommy.
13645800	13650800	Mommy is crying.
13651800	13656800	Mommy is crying.
13663800	13670800	In the meantime, while you all wait for me to come back, you can send me sweet, sweet morals.
13670800	13683800	You can send me morals, sweet messages, like there's letters to me, and I'll read them, and I'll go over them, and I'll heart them, so I know that I read them.
13687800	13694800	Okay, send me morals. That's fine. I'll take your morals.
13695800	13704800	I'm not really bothered by all the other morals. I just wanted to talk about it a little bit, that it was silly. That's all.
13708800	13712800	And I'll be the last time I talk about those morals, alright?
13715800	13717800	That is the last.
13718800	13736800	But other than that, I have received so many kind morals from so many of you already, and I feel so bad that I haven't responded to some of them, but I have given a lot of hearts to them.
13736800	13741800	I think I was told that you guys can still see when I heart a moral.
13748800	13750800	I think.
13766800	13771800	So, send me your sweet words, and I'll listen to them. I'll read them.
13772800	13780800	I started responding to really old morals that I didn't respond to like 14 days ago.
13781800	13789800	I think I'm now in the 12 days ago ones, so it's taking me time, but I'll get through it.
13790800	13792800	I'm so sorry.
13802800	13813800	Yeah, so, you can like literally see, I think, a few morals that I made public, I think.
13814800	13826800	If you like scroll down the moral page, you can like scroll down. You can see the ones I have publicly responded to, so that you guys do not ask me the same questions over and over again.
13826800	13844800	I'm sorry if I don't answer some questions, but I get asked some questions like 20 times already and counting, so I just give it a heart and then I go past it.
13844800	13855800	It's been 84 years.
13859800	13862800	Read material as not to miss you.
13863800	13872800	If you guys haven't seen some of my vans or my past dreams, you can go take a look at those.
13873800	13878800	There's also the Patreon. You can visit the Patreon.
13880800	13882800	You can go in there.
13883800	13890800	There's also like in the future there will be other videos. There's as more download on the Twitter if you couldn't find that.
13891800	13899800	There's that. There's also my art that I do on the old. There's so much material already out and ready for you.
13900800	13907800	So if you really want to get that material, you know where to visit. Just check out in the description below.
13909800	13915800	It's not the same. How is it not the same? It's me. It's all me.
13920800	13929800	You can also buy my merch, buy the merch, and you can literally have me closer to your heart than ever before.
13950800	13965800	It's inevitable, sadly.
13965800	13983800	I might have to do more on the VOD Squad since my hour is at Oracle Chance. That's perfectly fine. I don't mind.
13984800	13991800	Whenever you have the time, you'll always bop in because I believe in your loyalty. I believe in it.
13992800	14001800	Don't worry. I believe in you. And I'll always be streaming for you.
14001800	14014800	A bottle of drool.
14014800	14024800	I'm glad I got a bit of the stream. Glad to have you here. We're just about to end it though.
14025800	14032800	We're going to pop in and raid Marseille. Sweet baby Marseille.
14032800	14043800	And she's doing a karaoke stream today, I think. Yeah, she's doing a karaoke stream.
14043800	14053800	To get to hear her sing, because I can't. Not yet.
14054800	14061800	And you to hear her sing, you can hear her sweet little voice.
14062800	14068800	I'm actually excited to listen to it a little bit.
14073800	14082800	You'll be waiting for my karaoke one day? Yeah, I'll do a karaoke stream.
14083800	14088800	I know tons of songs already.
14088800	14104800	Maybe, but it'll probably be an unarchived, however you say it, stream so that I don't get smacked with anything bad.
14105800	14111800	It sums to radio. That'd be fun.
14112800	14118800	I would have to learn a bunch of songs in some long language.
14118800	14134800	He is irate.
14135800	14140800	Like the Stardew Valley. Stardew Streams aren't karaoke enough.
14141800	14151800	They were, but because they weren't marked as so, I got hit.
14152800	14159800	I got copyrighted in that stream, in both of them.
14159800	14170800	So we got to be careful in normal streaming.
14171800	14175800	I'm probably going to get hit for playing that one jingle just for a little bit.
14176800	14182800	So I'm probably going to go and mute that section of the stream.
14183800	14187800	Because I completely forgot when I played it.
14187800	14194800	Oopsie, I forgot, I forgot, I'm stupid.
14205800	14208800	Yeah, I better be safe than sorry, yeah.
14209800	14216800	I gotta stop forgetting, I gotta remember, but I do just like singing some jingles that pop into my head.
14217800	14219800	I'm sure you never know, yeah.
14220800	14227800	Alright, so if you guys haven't already done so, please leave a like and subscribe.
