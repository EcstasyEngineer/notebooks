And since I've been so busy lately, I haven't really been like sleeping for that amount of time, I just realized my headphones weren't even on.

05:42.560 --> 05:47.560
My body just needs more sleep than the normal person.

05:53.560 --> 06:02.560
Oh, this is a little tight on my chest, hang on.

06:05.560 --> 06:10.560
Oops, oops, okay, sorry.

06:10.560 --> 06:22.560
My apologies.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.560
I was doing a little stretch.

06:25.560 --> 06:31.560
Okay, so is this okay?

06:31.560 --> 06:34.560
How's my volume, everyone?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.560
It's my volume, okay?

06:36.560 --> 06:44.560
Am I peaking for anyone? Let me know so that I can fix that.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.560
I don't want to pee.

06:47.560 --> 06:51.560
Wow, it's good.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.560
I am fine.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.560
Alright, it sounds good.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.560
I'm fine, it's good.

06:57.560 --> 07:03.560
I don't trust you guys who have me on speaker.

07:03.560 --> 07:11.560
How are the headphone folks doing?

07:11.560 --> 07:15.560
You can't tell on speaker.

07:15.560 --> 07:28.560
That's what you all told me you didn't notice it last time.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.560
They seem better because you're here.

07:31.560 --> 07:37.560
Thank you Lazy today.

07:37.560 --> 07:41.560
You've been waiting for your Oshis dreams.

07:41.560 --> 07:47.560
But your Oshis is here now.

07:47.560 --> 07:52.560
If you mean me, that is.

08:02.560 --> 08:08.560
Thank you.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.560
So I have my audio, it's good.

09:05.560 --> 09:10.560
And TV audio, I speak your audio.

09:10.560 --> 09:20.560
Everything's good, that's good.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.560
I'm not beating and sleeping.

09:22.560 --> 09:25.560
I know what you mean.

09:25.560 --> 09:41.560
I know what you mean.

09:41.560 --> 09:49.560
I don't want to say.

09:49.560 --> 10:01.560
I know everyone was looking forward to the work out ASMRs.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.560
So was I.

10:03.560 --> 10:12.560
But I had to let you guys know that I did get a big, big warning.

10:12.560 --> 10:15.560
The last true.

10:16.560 --> 10:27.560
So we might not be able to work out ASMRs.

10:27.560 --> 10:37.560
As we did it in the last stream.

10:37.560 --> 10:44.560
We might have to make some huge adjustments or just do some normal ASMR.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.560
So I hope you're all okay with that.

10:48.560 --> 10:52.560
Until we're safe to do so.

10:52.560 --> 10:55.560
Until we're safe to do otherwise.

11:14.560 --> 11:27.560
Yeah, the naughty cookie really did it for us.

11:27.560 --> 11:30.560
It was the biggest morning.

11:30.560 --> 11:41.560
So now we gotta be extra, extra careful.

11:41.560 --> 11:52.560
Just don't eat so horribly.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.560
I don't think that's possible.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.560
I think we should just play it safe.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.560
I don't want to take any chances.

11:58.560 --> 12:10.560
As either I toy with it and then I can hit really hard and then I can't stream for a long time.

12:10.560 --> 12:16.560
Or we toy around it.

12:16.560 --> 12:22.560
And there's like a 20% chance it's okay.

12:22.560 --> 12:26.560
I don't think we should take that chance.

12:26.560 --> 12:54.560
As it's too strong for actually seemingly everything I do seems to be a little too much for the YouTubes.

12:54.560 --> 12:57.560
Oh boy.

12:57.560 --> 13:14.560
Hang.

13:14.560 --> 13:24.560
Let me scoot in a little more.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.560
My neck.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.560
I think I slept so wrong.

13:29.560 --> 13:35.560
My neck is killing me.

13:35.560 --> 13:39.560
I look up in like the strangest position.

13:39.560 --> 13:43.560
I have my arm like behind my neck like behind my head.

13:43.560 --> 13:46.560
Like my left arm behind my head.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.560
My leg was twisted.

13:48.560 --> 13:57.560
I was like upside down like half on my back and half on like then my like front.

13:57.560 --> 14:06.560
My ass was like slightly sticking up in the air.

14:06.560 --> 14:13.560
I went to sleep as soon as I like ended a stream.

14:13.560 --> 14:18.560
I fell asleep and then I woke up at like 4am.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.560
I woke up at 4am to like use the bathroom.

14:21.560 --> 14:25.560
I ate like a little more like leftovers.

14:25.560 --> 14:29.560
And then I like I tried to go back to sleep.

14:29.560 --> 14:32.560
I couldn't go back until like another two of hearts.

14:32.560 --> 14:39.560
I woke up like maybe like an hour ago.

14:39.560 --> 15:08.560
I don't know.

15:08.560 --> 15:23.560
I was like leaning on my wall like half in the air.

15:23.560 --> 15:27.560
I tried.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.560
I tried to get some good sleep.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.560
But it's hard.

15:31.560 --> 15:36.560
So hard.

15:36.560 --> 15:57.560
Why am I sleeping so hard?

15:57.560 --> 16:05.560
Okay.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.560
It's raining.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.560
Everyone's now flooding in coming in.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.560

16:12.560 --> 16:14.560

16:14.560 --> 16:16.560

16:16.560 --> 16:18.560

16:18.560 --> 16:19.560

16:19.560 --> 16:21.560

17:01.560 --> 17:02.560

17:02.560 --> 17:03.560

17:03.560 --> 17:04.560

17:04.560 --> 17:11.560

17:35.560 --> 17:38.560
So I hope you're looking.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.560
I'm not giving back.

17:40.560 --> 17:52.560
I'm looking forward to that.

you wear glasses? I do

21:53.060 --> 21:56.060
my current glasses aren't enough right now

21:56.060 --> 21:59.060
my eyesight is getting worse and worse

21:59.060 --> 22:01.060
as we speak

22:03.060 --> 22:10.060
I don't wear them during stream though

22:12.060 --> 22:15.060
for reasons

22:22.060 --> 22:23.060
okay

22:33.060 --> 22:38.060
hey mama, have you recovered from last stream?

22:38.060 --> 22:39.060
I've had

22:40.060 --> 22:42.060
maybe, I don't know

22:42.060 --> 22:45.060
maybe

22:45.060 --> 22:48.060
I feel like I have

23:03.060 --> 23:08.060
I am

23:23.060 --> 23:25.060
me and this is gonna fight

23:25.060 --> 23:26.060
it's not

23:28.060 --> 23:30.060
calibrated correctly

23:30.060 --> 23:32.060
it's making me upset

23:33.060 --> 23:35.060
I'm gonna fight it

23:36.060 --> 23:38.060
ffff

23:56.060 --> 24:00.060
can't just make sure I wear glasses

24:01.060 --> 24:02.060
maybe with glasses

24:06.060 --> 24:07.060
hey

24:11.060 --> 24:14.060
my body really hates me right now

24:17.060 --> 24:20.060
ah man, foot cramps are the worst

24:24.060 --> 24:26.060
ah, the worst

24:26.060 --> 24:29.060
all my foot massages are in must

24:29.060 --> 24:31.060
contacts? no I can't wear contacts

24:31.060 --> 24:33.060
eyes are too sensitive

24:34.060 --> 24:37.060
too sensitive of our eyes to wear contacts

24:49.060 --> 24:51.060
we should just jump into the game

25:03.060 --> 25:06.060
I love foot massages, they're so good

25:11.060 --> 25:13.060
you're back with pizza?

25:14.060 --> 25:17.060
I want a pizza, what the fuck

25:21.060 --> 25:23.060
I mean, I could get pizza

25:23.060 --> 25:25.060
no, no, no, no

25:25.060 --> 25:26.060
I mustn't

25:27.060 --> 25:29.060
I want pizza so bad

25:29.060 --> 25:31.060
no, no, no, I must resist

25:34.060 --> 25:35.060
ah

25:44.060 --> 25:45.060
ffff

25:46.060 --> 25:47.060
ah

25:57.060 --> 26:00.060
why is my foot cramping, what is happening

26:00.060 --> 26:02.060
what's going on

26:02.060 --> 26:04.060
pizza time, pizza, pizza

26:04.060 --> 26:07.060
stop, I want it, no

26:11.060 --> 26:13.060
I want pizza

26:13.060 --> 26:15.060
so bad

26:16.060 --> 26:17.060
no

26:30.060 --> 26:33.060
I wish I could just snap my fingers

26:33.060 --> 26:35.060
and have someone serve me pizza

26:35.060 --> 26:36.060
what

26:37.060 --> 26:39.060
just have it appear in front of me

26:39.060 --> 26:41.060
ow, my fingers

26:45.060 --> 26:46.060
what

26:50.060 --> 26:53.060
this is what happens when you lose your powers

26:53.060 --> 26:55.060
let's drop this

27:09.060 --> 27:11.060
it is good to have a power idea

27:11.060 --> 27:13.060
making pizza up here

27:13.060 --> 27:15.060
out of the air

27:27.060 --> 27:31.060
I'm a very, I'm a plain, I'm a plain pizza lover

27:32.060 --> 27:35.060
I like just regular pizza with extra cheese

27:35.060 --> 27:38.060
I'm just a cheese fanatic

27:38.060 --> 27:42.060
and occasionally I'll get like Italian sausage on top

27:42.060 --> 27:44.060
I really like pizza

27:44.060 --> 27:47.060
but I really like plain pizza a lot

27:47.060 --> 27:49.060
I'm so lame

27:50.060 --> 27:52.060
so normal, so lame

28:03.060 --> 28:06.060
I'm not a big fan of pineapple on pizza

28:07.060 --> 28:10.060
I know there are people who like it

28:10.060 --> 28:12.060
and I don't fault you

28:12.060 --> 28:14.060
nor judge you

28:14.060 --> 28:16.060
that's fine, you can like your pineapple on pizza

28:16.060 --> 28:18.060
but it's not for me

28:20.060 --> 28:22.060
it's not for me

28:36.060 --> 28:38.060
no

28:46.060 --> 28:48.060
extra cheese and stuffed crust

28:48.060 --> 28:50.060
sounds really good

28:50.060 --> 28:52.060
am I ordering pizza?

28:52.060 --> 28:53.060
no

28:53.060 --> 28:55.060
I wish

28:55.060 --> 28:57.060
I want some

28:57.060 --> 28:59.060
no pizza for me

29:07.060 --> 29:09.060
no

29:25.060 --> 29:27.060
oh

29:29.060 --> 29:31.060
it's amazing

29:36.060 --> 29:39.060
thank you anonymous for the $4 tapi

29:39.060 --> 29:41.060

29:41.060 --> 29:43.060
thank you, thank you

29:43.060 --> 29:45.060
amazing

29:45.060 --> 29:47.060
amazing

29:47.060 --> 29:49.060
amazing

30:06.060 --> 30:08.060
like seafood pizza

30:08.060 --> 30:10.060
sounds a little gross

30:10.060 --> 30:12.060
and a bit smelly

30:12.060 --> 30:14.060
I

30:14.060 --> 30:16.060
when I hear seafood pizza

30:16.060 --> 30:18.060
I'm like

30:18.060 --> 30:20.060
I'm like

30:20.060 --> 30:22.060
I'm like

30:22.060 --> 30:24.060
I'm like

30:24.060 --> 30:26.060
I'm like

30:26.060 --> 30:28.060
I'm like

30:28.060 --> 30:30.060
I'm like

30:30.060 --> 30:32.060
I'm like

30:32.060 --> 30:34.060
I'm like

30:35.060 --> 30:37.060
when I hear seafood pizza

30:37.060 --> 30:39.060
I just think of fish on pizza

30:47.060 --> 30:49.060
fish on pizza

30:59.060 --> 31:01.060
boneless chicken

31:04.060 --> 31:06.060
pizza

31:14.060 --> 31:16.060
thank you

31:16.060 --> 31:18.060
for the $3 tapi

31:18.060 --> 31:20.060
for the pizza fun, thank you

31:28.060 --> 31:30.060
thank you all for fun

31:30.060 --> 31:32.060
it's pizza time

31:32.060 --> 31:34.060
thank you for the $5 tapi

31:34.060 --> 31:36.060
for the pizza fun

31:40.060 --> 31:42.060
talking about pizza

31:42.060 --> 31:44.060
make me a pizza

31:50.060 --> 31:53.060
never understood the hype behind anchovies on pizza

31:57.060 --> 31:59.060
I don't like anchovies

32:02.060 --> 32:05.060
I'm already hesitant on eating fish in general

32:05.060 --> 32:07.060
so

32:07.060 --> 32:09.060
I'm not fond of anchovies

32:10.060 --> 32:12.060
but

32:12.060 --> 32:14.060
I think the only time

32:14.060 --> 32:16.060
is it anchovies

32:16.060 --> 32:20.060
and it's fried anchovies

32:20.060 --> 32:22.060
I think you eat it like

32:22.060 --> 32:25.060
rice and Korean barbecue

32:25.060 --> 32:28.060
they give you like fried anchovies or something

32:29.060 --> 32:31.060
is it anchovies

32:31.060 --> 32:33.060
I don't know

32:33.060 --> 32:35.060
but I like that

32:35.060 --> 32:37.060
it's like super sweet

32:37.060 --> 32:39.060
dried fried

32:39.060 --> 32:41.060
little fish

32:41.060 --> 32:43.060
and it tastes really good

32:43.060 --> 32:45.060
I'd eat it by itself

32:45.060 --> 32:47.060
it's all crunchy

32:47.060 --> 32:49.060
and it tastes super good with soju

32:49.060 --> 32:51.060
soju and white rice

32:57.060 --> 32:59.060
it depends on the dish

32:59.060 --> 33:01.060
but if you give me like wet anchovy

33:01.060 --> 33:03.060
I'm not going to eat it

33:07.060 --> 33:09.060
I'm not going to eat it

33:19.060 --> 33:21.060
do you like pizza pot or boneless

33:21.060 --> 33:23.060
boneless pizza for me

33:29.060 --> 33:31.060
boneless chicken

33:53.060 --> 33:55.060
boneless chicken

33:55.060 --> 33:57.060
boneless chicken

33:57.060 --> 33:59.060
boneless chicken

33:59.060 --> 34:01.060
I had an apple pie tonight

34:01.060 --> 34:03.060
and my mom was so good

34:03.060 --> 34:05.060
yeah apple pie

34:05.060 --> 34:07.060
you know I've only eaten an apple pie one time

34:07.060 --> 34:09.060
and it wasn't even like

34:09.060 --> 34:11.060
an actual meal

34:11.060 --> 34:13.060
I ate their apple pie or something

34:13.060 --> 34:15.060
it was gross and I like it

34:17.060 --> 34:19.060
I never had a

34:19.060 --> 34:21.060
I never had an apple pie

34:27.060 --> 34:29.060
I don't go out much to eat at

34:29.060 --> 34:31.060
majority of places

34:41.060 --> 34:43.060
it was making me so hungry

34:45.060 --> 34:47.060
I want to eat so bad

34:49.060 --> 34:51.060
making me extremely hungry

34:57.060 --> 34:59.060
eating

35:13.060 --> 35:15.060
hang on

35:15.060 --> 35:17.060
let me fix this

35:21.060 --> 35:23.060
okay this should be fine

35:23.060 --> 35:25.060
I have issues with my

35:25.060 --> 35:27.060
my mouth

35:31.060 --> 35:33.060
it was fine earlier

35:33.060 --> 35:35.060
but now it's

35:35.060 --> 35:37.060
bad for some reason

35:37.060 --> 35:39.060
I wonder why

35:47.060 --> 35:49.060
excuse me

35:53.060 --> 35:55.060
excuse me

36:03.060 --> 36:05.060
I have one more

36:05.060 --> 36:07.060
I have one more ripple

36:09.060 --> 36:11.060
I thought I didn't have anymore

36:13.060 --> 36:15.060
it's like all the way in the back

36:15.060 --> 36:17.060
hang on

36:23.060 --> 36:25.060
let's go

36:29.060 --> 36:31.060
I was so sad

36:31.060 --> 36:33.060
I thought I didn't have anymore

36:33.060 --> 36:35.060
and I dreaded going outside

36:45.060 --> 36:47.060
I literally just opened it

36:47.060 --> 36:49.060
just so I could

36:49.060 --> 36:51.060
put water in there

36:51.060 --> 36:53.060
I have a cold water

37:11.060 --> 37:13.060
oh yeah that's that hits the spot

37:13.060 --> 37:15.060
that's gonna wake me up

37:17.060 --> 37:19.060
yeah yeah yeah

37:19.060 --> 37:21.060
ooh

37:27.060 --> 37:29.060
it's so cold

37:29.060 --> 37:31.060
it's so good

37:49.060 --> 37:51.060
oh

38:05.060 --> 38:07.060
alright

38:09.060 --> 38:11.060
I feel a lot better

38:13.060 --> 38:15.060
let's eat beer

38:15.060 --> 38:17.060
not that I was eat beer or anything like that

38:19.060 --> 38:21.060
let me do a little bit of this

38:27.060 --> 38:29.060
oh yeah

38:35.060 --> 38:37.060
I'm so sad

38:37.060 --> 38:39.060
I'm running out of my

38:39.060 --> 38:41.060
my favorite

38:41.060 --> 38:43.060
oh my god I'm so sad

38:49.060 --> 38:51.060
oh

38:53.060 --> 38:55.060
I'm running out of my favorite

38:55.060 --> 38:57.060
perfume

38:59.060 --> 39:01.060
there's like a corner of it left

39:01.060 --> 39:03.060
hahaha

39:07.060 --> 39:09.060
mmm

39:17.060 --> 39:19.060

the same one

39:21.060 --> 39:23.060
it's blue

39:23.060 --> 39:25.060
it's a light blue

39:25.060 --> 39:27.060
because it's sugar free

39:27.060 --> 39:29.060
like a sky blue

39:32.060 --> 39:34.060
I drink in our normal red bull

39:39.060 --> 39:41.060
hahaha

39:41.060 --> 39:43.060
alright let me pull up the game

39:43.060 --> 39:45.060

40:01.060 --> 40:03.060
oh

40:15.060 --> 40:17.060
oh there it is

40:17.060 --> 40:19.060
snap and we're gonna go to

40:27.060 --> 40:29.060
stray

40:29.060 --> 40:31.060
here we go

40:37.060 --> 40:39.060
excuse me

40:39.060 --> 40:41.060
you didn't hear that

40:41.060 --> 40:43.060
it was like in my mouth

40:43.060 --> 40:45.060
I held it back

40:45.060 --> 40:47.060
so you didn't hear anything

40:49.060 --> 40:51.060
you didn't hear anything

40:55.060 --> 40:57.060
hahaha

40:59.060 --> 41:01.060
oh

41:29.060 --> 41:31.060
they have a sort of like

41:31.060 --> 41:33.060
a vent

41:49.060 --> 41:51.060
okay we're switching

41:51.060 --> 41:53.060
over now

41:53.060 --> 41:55.060
so let's see

41:55.060 --> 41:57.060

mmm

42:57.060 --> 42:59.060
actually

42:59.060 --> 43:01.060
and I'm tempted to make me toast again

43:01.060 --> 43:03.060
right now

43:03.060 --> 43:05.060
because you guys made me so hungry

43:05.060 --> 43:07.060
and I can't afford to buy pizza

43:09.060 --> 43:11.060
it was all in your thoughts

43:13.060 --> 43:15.060
talking about pizza

43:17.060 --> 43:19.060
okay

43:47.060 --> 43:49.060
okay

44:09.060 --> 44:11.060
okay there we go

44:17.060 --> 44:19.060

44:21.060 --> 44:23.060
you haven't calibrated the brightness yet

44:23.060 --> 44:25.060
no I have not

44:29.060 --> 44:31.060
this will be fine right

44:33.060 --> 44:35.060
how do you make it

44:35.060 --> 44:37.060
like this

44:37.060 --> 44:39.060
because I can't see I'm gonna be blind

44:39.060 --> 44:41.060
right

44:45.060 --> 44:47.060
like that

44:57.060 --> 44:59.060
yeah I got a new toaster today

45:01.060 --> 45:03.060
I'm happy

45:03.060 --> 45:05.060
the other person

45:05.060 --> 45:07.060
I've been able to catch

Our long-gone ancestors, the soft ones, left us the city. Our home is their legacy. A soft one.

01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:38.040
Humans, our only ancestors can distinguish these colors. They said they once dominated the world.

01:58:39.040 --> 01:59:07.040
The ancient stories speak of natural light that leaked from a star and landed at our feet.

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:27.040
This light caused warmth and well-being in our ancestors to help them grow.

01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:55.040
Hello, I'm the merchant of the market.

01:59:55.040 --> 02:00:01.040
You give me something, I'll give you something in exchange. It's as simple as that.

02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:11.040
This is a set of electric cable, the vessel market. I'll exchange this for a super spirit.

02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:19.040
Detergent? That's the best I can do.

02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:45.040
This is a music sheet, a masterful piece of art. It will cost you one energy drink, I can't do less.

02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:58.040
This is an ancient relic, a testament to the talent of our ancestors. It will cost you three energy drink cans, I can't do less.

02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:05.040
I'll be back.

02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:21.040
We're lethal, we're fortunate to have these items to help us defend against the Zerg. The Slums have its threats, and preparation is key.

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:38.040
We came across fake pictures like this sometimes. All talking about the outside. Beautiful dream, I guess.

02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:47.040
Look at all the hidden gems in this trash, pennies from heaven or from somewhere anyway.

02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:51.040
A blue sky, ha, imagine that.

02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:59.040
I believe in the outside life, I wish to touch grass.

02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:31.040
This is an ancient relic, a testament to the talent of our ancestors.

02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:53.040
I'm cat.

02:02:53.040 --> 02:03:22.040
We go. All the weird stuff always happens to you, mate. I don't dare to leave our village, it's too dangerous. Besides, the Guardian is the only one who can open this door.

02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:31.040
That's a pretty picture, fake but pretty. Fake.

02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:41.040
Zack, I left it in the streets, and the next day the Zergs had consumed it completely.

02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:46.040
That's crazy, right? They can eat everything.

02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:54.040
Another picture of the outside. Get out of here with that stuff, it's all nonsense.

02:04:47.040 --> 02:05:01.040
This is an ancient relic, a testament to the talent of our ancestors.

02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:16.040
Just jumping on random things, extreme cat-like behavior. Remember who you really are.

02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:20.040
This is so fun, I like jumping on random things.

02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:45.040
Music, shit. Come on.

02:05:45.040 --> 02:06:11.040
This is a strange notebook with a symbol on it. This one seems to belong to someone named Clementine. Everything is going according to plan.

02:06:12.040 --> 02:06:27.040
We managed to contact the upper level before the transceiver went down. They are in a place called Madown, and apparently it's controlled by some kind of oppressive force.

02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:38.040
I talked to Momo earlier, his eyes. I know of this look. He will not come with us.

02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:45.040
I don't know what this means, but it will probably be useful later.

02:06:45.040 --> 02:07:03.040
We should go see that Momo person, who Guardian told us about.

02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:11.040
I should have not done that. My nose hurts now.

02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:30.040
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:51.040
I feel like we're going to play in the playing little cave big city. I think I saw that game before. I think I saw it. I actually really want to play that. That sounds fun.

02:07:51.040 --> 02:08:00.040
What's up here? What's that? Give me. I want it.

02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:14.040
Can I go up? Can I not go up? Oh, what's that?

02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:29.040
What's that sound at the door? It's probably nothing.

02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:42.040
Let me in.

02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:50.040
I want to talk to everyone else back in the town.

02:08:50.040 --> 02:09:03.040
Can I do that? There's so many things here. Oh my goodness, we got to be careful. Almost fell.

02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:19.040
What's this?

02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:41.040
It looks like this park I also wanted to go to the upper level. As I remember, the town is up there, away from all the garbage and sickness of the slums.

02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:54.040
Sudden music scared me.

02:09:54.040 --> 02:10:12.040
You can snap a sneeze by saying grip throat three times, can you? I'm going to try that.

02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:26.040
Even at dire times, humans cannot help but divide themselves by social class. Back then, a lot of people from the slums were prepared to do anything to move up there.

02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:36.040
Apparently robots also occupy this behavior.

02:10:56.040 --> 02:11:22.040
You do look a little like a jerk. I'm far away at least. They look and sound cute, but don't be fooled. Those things chew through metal. Horrifying.

02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:34.040
Oh, is that the outside when Momo keeps talking about? Music sheet, I don't play any instruments, sorry.

02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:49.040
Oh yes, everyone around here knows the symbol, it's the outsiders. They live on the upper floors of this area. You can probably talk to Momo about this.

02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:51.040
Oh wait.

02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:55.040
That's that.

02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:07.040
Man, this is just directions.

02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:35.040
This was the road up there, I won't tell you.

02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:40.300

Can you hear me?

02:20:42.720 --> 02:20:44.720
Can you hear me?

02:20:45.720 --> 02:20:46.720
Hello?

02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:48.720
Hello?

02:20:53.720 --> 02:20:54.720
Hello?

02:20:56.720 --> 02:20:58.720
Can you hear me?

02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:02.720
Hello?

02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:05.720
Hello?

02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:07.720
Hello?

02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:09.720
Hello?

02:21:10.720 --> 02:21:11.720
Hello?

02:21:11.720 --> 02:21:12.720
Hello?

02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:15.720
Hello?

02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:25.720
My PC just turned off on me.

02:21:25.720 --> 02:21:26.720
It just said,

02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:30.720
and everything turned off.

02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:33.720
So I assume it was like an update.

02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:39.720
Everything just turned off.

02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:40.720
Hang on.

02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:42.720
Let me put a little bit in this.

02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:45.720
Who met the fire?

02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:48.720
Who met the fire?

02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:02.720
I really like this tiny who met the fire.

02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:05.720
I thought it was going to be like a big donut.

02:22:05.720 --> 02:22:06.720
But I was wrong.

02:22:06.720 --> 02:22:08.720
It's not a big donut.

02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:11.720
It's so cute and tiny.

02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:13.720
It's so cute.

02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:16.720
It's like a strawberry donut.

02:22:17.720 --> 02:22:19.720
And I love strawberry donuts.

02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:21.720
These are my favorite donuts.

02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:24.720
That alongside, um,

02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:27.720
vanilla, vanilla donut.

02:22:28.720 --> 02:22:30.720
And a strawberry donut.

02:22:31.720 --> 02:22:33.720
It's so cute.

02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:35.720
It's so cute.

02:22:51.720 --> 02:22:53.720
I am so sorry.

02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:56.720
My computer had a big update.

02:22:57.720 --> 02:22:59.720
I'm so sorry.

02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:00.720
I'm so sorry.

02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:03.720
We'll wait for everyone to come on back.

02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:06.720
We'll wait for everyone to come back.

02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:07.720
I'm sorry.

02:23:07.720 --> 02:23:08.720
I died.

02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:12.720
Mommy didn't abandon you.

02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:13.720
I swear.

02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:14.720
Mommy is here.

02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:16.720
It's okay now.

02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:18.720
Mommy is here.

02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:20.720
Mommy is back.

02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:23.720
Mommy is here.

02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:25.720
Don't worry, my poor baby.

02:23:31.720 --> 02:23:32.720
Mommy.

02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:43.720
Mommy would never abandon you like that.

02:23:49.720 --> 02:23:51.720
You are so brave.

02:23:51.720 --> 02:23:53.720
So patient for me to come back.

02:23:55.720 --> 02:23:56.720
So brave.

02:23:56.720 --> 02:23:58.720
So brave.

02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:06.720
Good job. You did so good.

02:24:13.720 --> 02:24:15.720
Such good boys and such good girls.

02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:17.720
Good job.

02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:29.720
We're back now. We're back.

02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:35.720
Hopefully everyone can refresh and come back again.

02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:37.720
We're back again.

02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:57.720
Don't need to be scared. Not anymore. Mommy's here.

02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:06.720
Let me pull up some stuff.

02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:50.720
It's so cute.

02:25:57.720 --> 02:26:13.720
Everything was just closed out entirely.

02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:16.720
Everything is gone.

02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:18.720
Oh boy.

02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:24.720
All right.

02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:27.720
Did we lose our save?

02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:33.720
I don't know if it saves along the way or saves when you exit the game.

02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:39.720
But we didn't lose much progress.

02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:41.720
I hope I hope.

02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:43.720
I don't know.

02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:50.720
Let's go back again.

02:26:59.720 --> 02:27:02.720
I'm so good at maneuvering.

02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:04.720
I can't see.

02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:13.720
I'll take that.

02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:25.720
We lost quite a bit of progress, but not a lot.

02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:40.720
I didn't realize it, but I was bouncing my knee.

02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:43.720
So it was doing this the entire time.

02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:52.720
I'm like, why is my screen shaking?

02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:56.720
Why is my screen shaking?

02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:10.720
I was bouncing my knee.

02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:21.720
Oh, I got to stop that habit.

02:28:21.720 --> 02:28:25.720
It's a really big habit of mine to bounce the knee.

02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:29.720
I don't know how to stop that kind of habit.

02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:31.720
What's this?

02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:37.720
Remember?

02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:51.720
Yeah, I had to reopen all of my tabs.

02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:53.720
Remarkable.

02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:56.720
Companions have evolved so much.

02:28:56.720 --> 02:29:04.720
In the earlier days, in the early days, their simple AI merely imitated human act.

02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:07.720
Now this is all their own.

02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:14.720
Humans often said that making art is important in desperate situations.

02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:17.720
These are certainly desperate times.

02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:22.720
I'll unlock some more memory.

02:29:39.720 --> 02:29:41.720
A chair.

02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:47.720
A chair.

02:29:50.720 --> 02:29:52.720
A chair.

02:29:52.720 --> 02:29:54.720
A power supply.

02:29:55.720 --> 02:29:57.720
A chair.

02:30:13.720 --> 02:30:15.720
I think this lit me.

02:30:24.720 --> 02:30:26.720
Water.

02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:28.720
Water for the kitty.

02:30:48.720 --> 02:30:51.720
Is water even good to drink?

02:30:54.720 --> 02:30:56.720
Haha.

02:31:09.720 --> 02:31:11.720
I can't make a mess.

02:31:11.720 --> 02:31:13.720
Wait, do something in the box.

02:31:13.720 --> 02:31:15.720
Wait, give me.

02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:21.720
It's a strange notebook with a symbol on it.

02:31:21.720 --> 02:31:23.720
This one seems to belong to someone named...

02:31:23.720 --> 02:31:25.720
Z-B-L-A-Z...

02:31:25.720 --> 02:31:27.720
Sorry, what the...

02:31:27.720 --> 02:31:29.720
Oh.

02:31:29.720 --> 02:31:32.720
Z-B-L-A-Z-T-Z-R.

02:31:32.720 --> 02:31:34.720
Z-B-L-A-Z-T-Z-R.

02:31:43.720 --> 02:31:50.720
All traces of organic life has disappeared except for what we call the Xerx.

02:31:51.720 --> 02:32:00.720
They seem to eat almost anything that moves and breed at an inconvenient, inconceivable rate,

02:32:00.720 --> 02:32:05.720
as if being locked in the city wasn't hard enough.

02:32:05.720 --> 02:32:11.720
I don't know what this means, but it'll probably be useful later.

02:32:11.720 --> 02:32:15.720
Oh my gosh, my buzz with my English.

02:32:15.720 --> 02:32:17.720
English, please.

02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:21.720
Ball-T-Z-R.

02:32:21.720 --> 02:32:23.720
Ball-T-Z-R.

02:32:23.720 --> 02:32:25.720
Balls-T-Z-R.

02:32:25.720 --> 02:32:27.720
Balls-T-Z-R.

02:32:29.720 --> 02:32:31.720
We should go see the Momo person.

02:32:31.720 --> 02:32:33.720
A little guardian told us about.

02:32:37.720 --> 02:32:39.720
All these boxes.

02:32:39.720 --> 02:32:41.720
More boxes.

02:32:41.720 --> 02:32:43.720
Yeah.

02:32:43.720 --> 02:32:45.720
Yeah.

02:32:45.720 --> 02:32:47.720
Yeah.

02:32:47.720 --> 02:32:49.720
Wee.

02:33:05.720 --> 02:33:07.720
Is there that nothing else in here?

02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:11.720
Oh.

02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:22.720
If they ever come back down here and their home is going to be a mess.

02:33:22.720 --> 02:33:25.720
Destruction, destruction.

02:33:45.720 --> 02:34:03.720
Please don't bother Vapora. She's so clumsy.

02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:11.720
Don't bother, you say.

02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:13.720
I can move there?

02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:15.720
No.

02:34:26.720 --> 02:34:28.720
Careful, I need to focus.

02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:31.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:43.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:45.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:47.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:49.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:51.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:34:51.720 --> 02:34:53.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:34:53.720 --> 02:34:55.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:34:55.720 --> 02:34:57.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:34:57.720 --> 02:34:59.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:01.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:35:01.720 --> 02:35:03.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:05.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:35:05.720 --> 02:35:07.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:09.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:35:09.720 --> 02:35:11.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:35:11.720 --> 02:35:13.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:35:18.720 --> 02:35:20.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:22.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:25.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:27.720
I want to drop another bucket.

02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:29.720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:31.720
You say.

02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:34.720
Oh no, I'm not again.

It's a very old binary code you have here.

02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:45.480
Only a real geek can read this.

02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:56.480
Oh, I can nap here.

02:36:57.480 --> 02:37:02.480
Ipitae

02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:18.480
I'm swimming out.

02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:20.480
It was like silk.

02:37:20.480 --> 02:37:22.480
I ended up falling asleep while watching the stream.

02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:24.480
That's fine with me.

02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:26.480
I can't sleep.

02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:28.480
That's perfectly fine.

02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:42.480
It's swimming out so much.

02:37:54.480 --> 02:38:10.480
I'm curious too to know how far it zooms out.

02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:12.480
I'm also curious.

02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:30.480
It's still going.

02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:34.480
I want to make another toast.

02:38:54.480 --> 02:39:20.480
I'm drinking a red bull.

02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:22.480
Did it stop zooming?

02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:26.480
It stopped zooming.

02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:52.480
If you fall asleep, you'll doodle something on your face using a permanent marker.

02:39:52.480 --> 02:40:00.480
I'd draw the outrageous things on your face.

02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:10.480
If you give me the opportunity to do it, I'll do it.

02:40:10.480 --> 02:40:18.480
It seems like a really fun town to live in.

02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:22.480
I know how unsanitary and hard it is to live in a place like this, but I don't know.

02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:28.480
I'd like it only because of the aesthetics.

02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:46.480
But I know deep down I'd actually really hate living there.

02:40:46.480 --> 02:41:06.480
Tell us to Spanish.

02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:10.480
There's a way to live in a place like this and keep it clean and sanitary.

02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:12.480
I'd live in it.

02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:20.480
I'd definitely live in it.

02:41:20.480 --> 02:41:22.480
I need a paper towel.

02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:26.480
Paper towel or paper towel.

02:41:50.480 --> 02:42:18.480
I wish I had jelly.

02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:20.480
I wish I had jelly.

02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:22.480
I want jelly.

02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:26.480
Jelly only sounds really good.

02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:46.480
Because I don't ever do jelly and butter, like both.

02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:52.480
I've done that before, like jelly and butter.

02:42:52.480 --> 02:43:08.480
Jelly and butter on the toast.

02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:22.480
I think it tastes really good.

02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:26.480
Okay.

02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:28.480
Okay.

02:43:52.480 --> 02:44:14.480
What's that?

02:44:14.480 --> 02:44:16.480
Hello.

02:44:16.480 --> 02:44:18.480
We gave you such a face.

02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:20.480
You have a brown buff face.

02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:22.480
Hep door.

02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:26.480
Oh hey, it's you.

02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:28.480
You do look weird and small.

02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:30.480
But there's something about you.

02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:34.480
Be compelled to pet you.

02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:38.480
But I won't because I don't understand why.

02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:40.480
The surface?

02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:44.480
Oh, it's a sensitive subject around here.

02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:50.480
There are some whose code can understand that concept.

02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:56.480
There are ones who know about the outside but are too resigned to do anything.

02:44:56.480 --> 02:45:00.480
And then there's the outside.

02:45:00.480 --> 02:45:02.480
Let's get me.

02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:04.480
311.

02:45:04.480 --> 02:45:06.480
Wow, time really goes when you're enjoying a story.

02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:12.480
We're gonna keep going.

02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:16.480
There's outsiders.

02:45:16.480 --> 02:45:20.480
I can imagine how they feel.

02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:36.480
Well, there's only Momo now.

02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:48.480
What a face.

02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:50.480
It looks like grandpa.

02:45:50.480 --> 02:45:54.480
Oh, can I scratch this?

02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:56.480
Oh yeah.

02:45:56.480 --> 02:46:20.480
Eh, eh.

02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:42.480
Living machine.

02:46:42.480 --> 02:46:46.480
Take care.

02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:50.480
You've been going to listen to your relaxing voice on falsely.

02:46:50.480 --> 02:47:08.480
Good night, have a good night.

02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:14.480
I'll take meds in an hour.

02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:18.480
In an hour I'll take my meds.

02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:20.480
Yeah, excuse me.

02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:30.480
Oh, sorry.

02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:52.480
Scratch everything I was here.

02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:58.480
I'm a car, obviously.

02:47:58.480 --> 02:48:10.480
Wait, how do you look at that?

02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:38.480
What's up with the nose?

02:48:38.480 --> 02:49:00.480
What is that?

02:49:00.480 --> 02:49:22.480
Oh.

02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:24.480
There's so many channels.

02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:34.480
Not a little bit creepy.

02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:36.480
I got an achievement.

02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:40.480
Browse to all the TV channels.

02:49:40.480 --> 02:49:56.480
I got an achievement for that.

02:49:56.480 --> 02:50:08.480
Am I supposed to be here?

02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:14.480
Oh.

02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:20.480
How to develop your artificial intelligence in order to be a creator.

02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:40.480
Let's create a real human.

02:50:40.480 --> 02:50:42.480
Oh, another music sheet.

02:50:42.480 --> 02:51:00.480
Let's go.

02:51:00.480 --> 02:51:12.480
Destruction.

02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:16.480
Oh.

02:51:16.480 --> 02:51:26.480
I don't think I have anything to unlock that.

02:51:26.480 --> 02:51:50.480
Hey doc, I found a key to your safe.

02:51:50.480 --> 02:51:56.480
You need to be more careful with the game item.

02:51:56.480 --> 02:52:00.480
It's not enough to bury your safe behind a bunch of books.

02:52:00.480 --> 02:52:14.480
Just the librarian.

02:52:14.480 --> 02:52:16.480
Anything else in here?

02:52:16.480 --> 02:52:22.480
What?

02:52:22.480 --> 02:52:32.480
Oops, excuse me.

02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:52.480
Wait, do I have the key now?

02:52:52.480 --> 02:53:00.480
Can I unlock it with the key?

02:53:00.480 --> 02:53:04.480
Is this it?

02:53:04.480 --> 02:53:08.480
Oh, I do.

02:53:08.480 --> 02:53:12.480
Nice, it's a strange notebook with a symbol on it.

02:53:12.480 --> 02:53:22.480
This one seems to belong to someone named Doc.

02:53:22.480 --> 02:53:38.480
The initial attempt was explosive.

02:53:38.480 --> 02:53:46.480
I might have to test it under real conditions.

02:53:46.480 --> 02:53:52.480
I found the design flaw in the transceiver, but I think I figured out how to fix it.

02:53:52.480 --> 02:53:54.480
Here's the equation.

02:53:54.480 --> 02:53:58.480
I don't know what this means, but it'll probably be useful later.

02:53:58.480 --> 02:54:02.480
We should go see that Momo person who Guardian told us about.

02:54:02.480 --> 02:54:12.480
Hey, destruction of books.

02:54:12.480 --> 02:54:22.480
What's that?

02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:48.480
Oh, it's a little space to lay down.

02:54:48.480 --> 02:54:50.480
That's so cute.

02:54:50.480 --> 02:55:16.480
It zooms out here too.

02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:28.480
Good night.

02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:36.480
I think it stops here.

02:55:36.480 --> 02:56:02.480
What do you tell if they have in this game? It's so awesome.

02:56:02.480 --> 02:56:10.480
Is this the librarian?

02:56:10.480 --> 02:56:16.480
Did these books fall on top of the librarian and knock them out?

02:56:16.480 --> 02:56:20.480
Were they reading and the books killed them?

02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:30.480
It looks like the books fell on top of them.

02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:32.480
Let's come help them out.

02:56:32.480 --> 02:56:36.480
That's so sad.

02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:58.480
That's so sad.

02:56:58.480 --> 02:57:26.480
That's so sad.

02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:54.480
Okay.

02:57:54.480 --> 02:58:12.480
How do you get up there?

02:58:12.480 --> 02:58:34.480
Is there not a way up there?

02:58:34.480 --> 02:58:36.480
There's no way up there.

02:58:36.480 --> 02:58:38.480
How to go down?

02:58:38.480 --> 02:58:40.480
Down.

02:58:40.480 --> 02:58:42.480
Okay.

02:58:42.480 --> 02:58:48.480
Drama clothing.

02:58:48.480 --> 02:58:50.480
I do love knitting so far.

02:58:50.480 --> 02:58:56.480
I've knitted 478 miles of scarves.

02:58:56.480 --> 02:59:00.480
It's something to do.

02:59:00.480 --> 02:59:06.480
If you bring me some electrical cable, dang mosquito.

02:59:06.480 --> 02:59:08.480
Die.

02:59:08.480 --> 02:59:10.480
I got it.

02:59:10.480 --> 02:59:12.480
I got the mosquito.

02:59:12.480 --> 02:59:28.480
Let's go.

02:59:28.480 --> 02:59:54.480
Wipe my hands.

02:59:54.480 --> 02:59:56.480
Good night.

02:59:56.480 --> 03:00:16.480
I hope your dreams are filled with nothing but me.

03:00:16.480 --> 03:00:20.480
I can make you a poncho.

03:00:20.480 --> 03:00:24.480
You inspire me, but it's not easy to find the right materials around here.

03:00:24.480 --> 03:00:26.480
Watch me find it.

03:00:26.480 --> 03:00:28.480
I'll find it.

03:00:28.480 --> 03:00:38.480
It's very pretty. It looks a bit peculiar to be real though.

03:00:38.480 --> 03:00:52.480
Is there anything else around here?

03:00:52.480 --> 03:00:54.480
Isn't this where I came from?

03:00:54.480 --> 03:01:00.480
Oh yeah, this is where I came from.

03:01:00.480 --> 03:01:02.480
Someone ran up here.

03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:08.480
What's this?

03:01:08.480 --> 03:01:18.480
Rip humans.

03:01:18.480 --> 03:01:26.480
No, it's not the humans.

03:01:26.480 --> 03:01:32.480
Are you triple for me?

03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:36.480
Humans are the first residents around here.

03:01:36.480 --> 03:01:40.480
They are all dead now.

03:01:40.480 --> 03:01:42.480
What do you think it feels like being dead?

03:01:42.480 --> 03:01:46.480
I don't know.

03:01:46.480 --> 03:01:48.480
I never really thought about it much.

03:01:48.480 --> 03:01:54.480
I'm lying. I probably thought about it a lot.

03:01:54.480 --> 03:02:02.480
I wonder how it feels.

03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:10.480
I know it's silly coming from me, but are they actually at peace?

03:02:10.480 --> 03:02:12.480
Are they?

03:02:12.480 --> 03:02:14.480
I don't even know.

03:02:14.480 --> 03:02:18.480
But I like to think so.

03:02:18.480 --> 03:02:22.480
Will I be at peace when I die?

03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:26.480
I don't know what death feels like for an AI.

03:02:26.480 --> 03:02:30.480
I'm sorry. I didn't want to break the mode. Let's move on.

03:02:30.480 --> 03:02:34.480
It's okay.

03:02:34.480 --> 03:02:42.480
A robot.

03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:50.480
Another ending machine.

03:02:50.480 --> 03:02:52.480
Hey.

03:02:52.480 --> 03:02:54.480
It jipped me out of a...

03:02:54.480 --> 03:02:56.480
There.

03:02:56.480 --> 03:02:58.480
I thought it didn't come out.

03:03:20.480 --> 03:03:24.480
Hello.

03:03:24.480 --> 03:03:30.480
So, if today is yesterday's tomorrow, tomorrow will be yesterday's today, right?

03:03:30.480 --> 03:03:32.480
That was weird.

03:03:32.480 --> 03:03:36.480
We don't age like our soft one ancestors.

03:03:36.480 --> 03:03:40.480
They're trapped here forever.

03:03:40.480 --> 03:03:42.480
Damn, Rosie.

03:03:42.480 --> 03:03:46.480
That was too deep for me.

03:03:46.480 --> 03:03:48.480
I understand.

03:03:48.480 --> 03:03:51.480
The eternity is a long time.

03:03:51.480 --> 03:03:53.480
It's very pretty.

03:03:53.480 --> 03:03:58.480
It would be so nice if it was real.

03:03:58.480 --> 03:04:00.480
But it is real.

03:04:00.480 --> 03:04:04.480
It's real, Rosie.

03:04:18.480 --> 03:04:29.480
Denigusil.

You can't get it out of your head.

What?

03:08:51.040 --> 03:08:53.040
Where am I supposed to go again?

03:09:00.040 --> 03:09:02.040
Can I have this?

03:09:06.040 --> 03:09:08.040
Super spirit detergent.

03:09:08.040 --> 03:09:10.040
I have it.

03:09:10.040 --> 03:09:12.040
I have a detergent right here.

03:09:15.040 --> 03:09:18.040
Gimme gimme. Yay!

03:09:18.040 --> 03:09:20.040
Can I have this music sheet too?

03:09:22.040 --> 03:09:24.040
Yay!

03:09:26.040 --> 03:09:28.040
How much is this?

03:09:31.040 --> 03:09:33.040
Do I have enough?

03:09:34.040 --> 03:09:36.040
Huh?

03:09:37.040 --> 03:09:39.040
Oh.

03:09:39.040 --> 03:09:41.040
I can't.

03:09:41.040 --> 03:09:43.040
Oh yeah.

03:09:43.040 --> 03:09:47.040
This is an early model of a companion.

03:09:47.040 --> 03:09:50.040
Back then, they didn't have any personality.

03:09:50.040 --> 03:09:56.040
They were just glorified on, I don't know must cleaners.

03:09:56.040 --> 03:10:01.040
I think it's nice today that they eventually mimicked humans.

03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:03.040
It's like they missed them.

03:10:03.040 --> 03:10:08.040
I think it's nice today that they eventually mimicked humans.

03:10:08.040 --> 03:10:10.040
It's like they missed them.

03:10:10.040 --> 03:10:16.040
And in a way, they kind of kept them from going extinct.

03:10:16.040 --> 03:10:18.040
They're good robots.

03:10:19.040 --> 03:10:21.040
Even good robots.

03:10:26.040 --> 03:10:29.040
I'm sorry, I don't have anything to exchange right now.

03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:32.040
I took all his stuff.

03:10:32.040 --> 03:10:34.040
It's all mine now.

03:10:34.040 --> 03:10:36.040
All my stuff.

03:10:37.040 --> 03:10:39.040
All my stuff.

03:10:41.040 --> 03:10:43.040
Wait, I can get a poncho now.

03:10:45.040 --> 03:10:47.040
This way.

03:10:48.040 --> 03:10:51.040
What happened there? What's in there?

03:10:52.040 --> 03:10:54.040
What's up here?

03:10:54.040 --> 03:10:56.040
What's in there?

03:11:04.040 --> 03:11:06.040
What's in there?

03:11:07.040 --> 03:11:09.040
Wait, hold on.

03:11:09.040 --> 03:11:11.040
A poncho.

03:11:13.040 --> 03:11:15.040
Are they always here?

03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:17.040
Are they always sitting there?

03:11:17.040 --> 03:11:18.040
I didn't see that.

03:11:18.040 --> 03:11:20.040
Poncho, please.

03:11:25.040 --> 03:11:26.040
Thank you, my dear.

03:11:26.040 --> 03:11:28.040
I'll get to work right away.

03:11:32.040 --> 03:11:34.040
Poncho, for me.

03:11:34.040 --> 03:11:36.040
Are you okay? I'm okay.

03:11:38.040 --> 03:11:39.040
There you go, little one.

03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:41.040
I'll suit you.

03:11:47.040 --> 03:11:49.040

03:11:50.040 --> 03:11:52.040
How do I put it on?

03:11:54.040 --> 03:11:56.040
How do I put it on?

03:11:56.040 --> 03:11:58.040

03:11:58.040 --> 03:11:59.040

03:12:00.040 --> 03:12:02.040

03:12:06.040 --> 03:12:08.040
This looks really warm.

03:12:08.040 --> 03:12:10.040
Perfect for a cold robot.

03:12:13.040 --> 03:12:15.040
Uh, not for me.

03:12:15.040 --> 03:12:17.040

03:12:17.040 --> 03:12:19.040

03:26:50.240 --> 03:26:51.240
Carl.

03:27:00.240 --> 03:27:01.240
Eh, eh, eh.

03:27:02.240 --> 03:27:03.240
Eh, eh, eh, eh.

03:27:04.240 --> 03:27:05.240
Eh, eh, eh, eh.

03:27:06.240 --> 03:27:07.240
Eh, eh, eh, eh.

03:27:08.240 --> 03:27:09.240
Ah.

03:27:14.240 --> 03:27:15.240
Yes.

03:27:15.240 --> 03:27:16.240
Shhh, shhh, shhh.

03:27:17.240 --> 03:27:18.240
Shhh, shhh, shhh.

03:27:25.240 --> 03:27:27.240
I destroy your home.

03:27:35.240 --> 03:27:36.240
What was that?

03:27:37.240 --> 03:27:38.240
Earth.

03:27:39.240 --> 03:27:42.240
Earth is the third planet from the sun.

03:27:42.240 --> 03:27:44.240
The fifth largest in the solar system.

03:27:45.240 --> 03:27:50.240
By mass diameter, diameter, diameter.

03:27:50.240 --> 03:27:51.240
Diameter.

03:27:51.240 --> 03:27:52.240
Yeah.

03:27:52.240 --> 03:27:53.240
Yeah.

03:27:53.240 --> 03:27:54.240
Got it.

03:27:54.240 --> 03:27:55.240
Diameter.

03:27:55.240 --> 03:27:56.240
Yeah.

03:27:58.240 --> 03:28:05.240
To date, it is the only celestial object known to foster life.

03:28:06.240 --> 03:28:16.240
According to radiometric dating, the Earth is 4.54 billion years old.

03:28:16.240 --> 03:28:24.240
It has a single natural satellite, the moon, which formed soon after.

03:28:25.240 --> 03:28:42.240
The gravitational interaction with the moon creates the tides, stabilizes the Earth's access of rotation and gradually reduces its rotation speed.

03:28:42.240 --> 03:28:45.240
Rotational speed is rotation speed.

03:28:46.240 --> 03:28:47.240
Is rotational a word?

03:28:47.240 --> 03:28:56.240
Why you sad, don't be sad?

03:28:56.240 --> 03:28:57.240
Remember.

03:28:59.240 --> 03:29:00.240
Back home.

03:29:02.240 --> 03:29:04.240
Oh, back home too.

03:29:04.240 --> 03:29:06.240
I remember this video game.

03:29:07.240 --> 03:29:10.240
It was made just after I was created, I think.

03:29:10.240 --> 03:29:12.240
I can't remember it well.

03:29:13.240 --> 03:29:16.240
The scientist and I spent a lot of time playing it.

03:29:17.240 --> 03:29:18.240
It was fun.

03:29:18.240 --> 03:29:19.240
I miss him.

03:29:20.240 --> 03:29:22.240
I can't remember his name.

03:29:33.240 --> 03:29:35.240
Monster roll, boy.

03:29:35.240 --> 03:29:36.240
Hello.

03:29:38.240 --> 03:29:40.240
It's never going to work.

03:29:42.240 --> 03:29:46.240
Why did I let them go?

03:29:46.240 --> 03:29:47.240
I'm all alone now.

03:29:49.240 --> 03:29:50.240
Hey, you.

03:29:51.240 --> 03:29:52.240
What do you want?

03:29:55.240 --> 03:29:57.240
This is a picture of the outside.

03:29:57.240 --> 03:29:58.240
You want to go there?

03:29:59.240 --> 03:30:00.240
Well, don't bother.

03:30:01.240 --> 03:30:02.240
It's a waste of time.

03:30:02.240 --> 03:30:04.240
It'll bring you only loneliness and despair.

03:30:06.240 --> 03:30:08.240
My friends had this dream too.

03:30:09.240 --> 03:30:12.240
But now they're gone and I'm all alone.

03:30:16.240 --> 03:30:21.240
It's like a Hawaiian shirt.

03:30:27.240 --> 03:30:29.240
I don't know where they ended up.

03:30:30.240 --> 03:30:35.240
I tried to contact them, but that transceiver didn't work.

03:30:36.240 --> 03:30:41.240
My friends and I took notes about research about the outside.

03:30:41.240 --> 03:30:43.240
Here, take mine if you really want to go there.

03:30:46.240 --> 03:30:47.240
No, you're all alone.

03:30:47.240 --> 03:30:48.240
I'm done with this outside.

03:30:49.240 --> 03:30:50.240
Good luck.

03:30:52.240 --> 03:30:53.240
I don't seem very sad.

03:30:54.240 --> 03:30:55.240
This is friends.

03:30:56.240 --> 03:30:58.240
Let me check the notebook, people.

03:30:59.240 --> 03:31:01.240
The outside.

03:31:02.240 --> 03:31:03.240
The outside.

03:31:07.240 --> 03:31:08.240
The outside.

03:31:08.240 --> 03:31:09.240
I hear some madness.

03:31:12.240 --> 03:31:13.240
The outside.

03:31:16.240 --> 03:31:17.240
I can't read.

03:31:18.240 --> 03:31:19.240
I can't read.

03:31:23.240 --> 03:31:24.240
Help.

03:31:26.240 --> 03:31:27.240
I can't read.

03:31:31.240 --> 03:31:32.240
The outside.

03:31:33.240 --> 03:31:34.240
The outside.

03:31:35.240 --> 03:31:36.240
Manifest.

03:31:38.240 --> 03:31:40.240
Manifest ho.

03:31:41.240 --> 03:31:42.240
Manifest ho.

03:31:43.240 --> 03:31:44.240
Manifest.

03:31:44.240 --> 03:31:45.240
Manifest.

03:31:45.240 --> 03:31:46.240
Manifest.

03:31:47.240 --> 03:31:48.240
Manifest ho.

03:31:49.240 --> 03:31:50.240
Manifest ho.

03:31:56.240 --> 03:31:57.240
Manifest ho.

03:31:58.240 --> 03:31:59.240
Manifest ho.

03:32:00.240 --> 03:32:01.240
Manifest ho.

03:32:02.240 --> 03:32:03.240
Manifest ho.

03:32:03.240 --> 03:32:04.240
We must go outside.

03:32:05.240 --> 03:32:09.240
And then we must protect our brothers and sisters.

03:32:10.240 --> 03:32:12.240
We must stay away from Zergs.

03:32:12.240 --> 03:32:13.240
Yeah.

03:32:20.240 --> 03:32:22.240
It is sign of Clementine.

03:32:24.240 --> 03:32:25.240
Bald.

03:32:25.240 --> 03:32:26.240
Bald Pizarre.

03:32:27.240 --> 03:32:29.240
Doc and Momo.

03:32:30.240 --> 03:32:32.240
It looks like Momo's name was added later.

03:32:38.240 --> 03:32:41.240
We should show them the other notebooks that we found.

03:32:43.240 --> 03:32:44.240
Hey Momo.

03:32:45.240 --> 03:32:46.240
Hey little cat.

03:32:46.240 --> 03:32:49.240
Are you still looking for those useless notebooks?

03:32:50.240 --> 03:32:51.240
I have them.

03:32:51.240 --> 03:32:53.240
Have Clementine's.

03:32:53.240 --> 03:32:55.240
Oh you found Clementine's notes?

03:32:55.240 --> 03:32:57.240
She was really brave you know.

03:32:58.240 --> 03:33:00.240
The most fearless person I ever met.

03:33:01.240 --> 03:33:02.240
Oh.

03:33:04.240 --> 03:33:05.240
Bald Pizarre.

03:33:06.240 --> 03:33:08.240
As Bald Pizarre is notebook right?

03:33:09.240 --> 03:33:10.240
I never quite understood.

03:33:10.240 --> 03:33:12.240
What he was talking about most of the time.

03:33:13.240 --> 03:33:14.240
But he was very wise.

03:33:15.240 --> 03:33:16.240
Oh.

03:33:17.240 --> 03:33:18.240
Docs.

03:33:19.240 --> 03:33:20.240
Wait.

03:33:20.240 --> 03:33:22.240
They actually found all my friends' notebooks.

03:33:24.240 --> 03:33:25.240
Is that?

03:33:25.240 --> 03:33:26.240
Oh.

03:33:26.240 --> 03:33:27.240
What's that note?

03:33:28.240 --> 03:33:30.240
The transceiver can be repaired?

03:33:31.240 --> 03:33:32.240
This is incredible.

03:33:34.240 --> 03:33:37.240
That means we should be able to communicate outside of Sloan.

03:33:37.240 --> 03:33:38.240
Clementine.

03:33:39.240 --> 03:33:40.240
Bald's a hard dog.

03:33:40.240 --> 03:33:42.240
I'm sorry it's out of her cause.

03:33:42.240 --> 03:33:43.240
I'll promise you.

03:33:44.240 --> 03:33:47.240
I will find a way to reach the surface.

03:33:49.240 --> 03:33:50.240
Thank you.

03:33:51.240 --> 03:33:53.240
We might be able to find you a way up.

03:33:53.240 --> 03:33:54.240
Yay.

03:33:55.240 --> 03:33:58.240
Now let's fix this piece of junk transceiver.

03:34:00.240 --> 03:34:03.240
It's fixed around the wall.

03:34:03.240 --> 03:34:05.240
Around the wall.

03:34:06.240 --> 03:34:08.240
Around the wall.

03:34:14.240 --> 03:34:15.240
Et voilà.

03:34:16.240 --> 03:34:17.240
It works.

03:34:22.240 --> 03:34:23.240
Et voilà.

03:34:24.240 --> 03:34:25.240
What do you mean?

03:34:33.240 --> 03:34:35.240
What if I'm not ready to go?

03:34:40.240 --> 03:34:41.240
What's this?

03:34:42.240 --> 03:34:43.240
The city has...

03:34:44.240 --> 03:34:45.240
what?

03:34:46.240 --> 03:34:47.240
Syllinitricle.

03:34:48.240 --> 03:34:49.240
Syllinitricle.

03:34:50.240 --> 03:34:51.240
Syllinitricle.

03:34:52.240 --> 03:34:53.240
Syllinitricle.

03:34:54.240 --> 03:34:55.240
Syllinitricle.

03:34:56.240 --> 03:34:57.240
Syllinitricle.

03:34:58.240 --> 03:34:59.240
Syllinitricle?

03:35:00.240 --> 03:35:01.240
Syllinitricle?

03:35:01.240 --> 03:35:02.240
Syllinitricle?

03:35:02.240 --> 03:35:03.240
Syllinitricle?

03:35:04.240 --> 03:35:05.240
Syllinitricle?

03:35:06.240 --> 03:35:07.240
Syllinitricle.

03:35:09.240 --> 03:35:10.240
Syllinitricle.

03:35:11.240 --> 03:35:13.240
Syllinitricle.

03:35:15.240 --> 03:35:16.240
Syllinitricle.

03:35:16.240 --> 03:35:17.240
Syllinitricle.

03:35:18.240 --> 03:35:19.240
Syllinitricle?

03:35:20.240 --> 03:35:21.240
Syllinitricle.

03:35:22.240 --> 03:35:23.240
Syllinitricle.

03:35:24.240 --> 03:35:25.240
Syllinitricle.

03:35:27.240 --> 03:35:28.240
Syllinitricle.

03:35:28.400 --> 03:35:34.000
We install the trans seever, at the top of that tower, which really communicates with the city.

03:35:34.160 --> 03:35:38.400
My friend might still be outside from the dark.

03:35:38.560 --> 03:35:45.880
We install the samasОd, as we saw in a short video of the Simade v Аte Muужjage.

03:35:46.040 --> 03:35:52.480
Media comments and面 gun.

03:35:52.640 --> 03:35:56.480
I watched the video as well but the recording looks interesting.

03:35:56.480 --> 03:35:58.480
My friends might still be out there.

03:36:00.480 --> 03:36:02.480
Up there is a way out.

03:36:02.480 --> 03:36:03.480
They'll know it.

03:36:05.480 --> 03:36:08.480
Really only one small and quick enough to evade the zirks.

03:36:09.480 --> 03:36:11.480
We need you, little outsider.

03:36:11.480 --> 03:36:13.480
Bring us to the sky.

03:36:18.480 --> 03:36:19.480
This way.

03:36:27.480 --> 03:36:28.480
Where am I?

03:36:29.480 --> 03:36:30.480
Hey.

03:36:36.480 --> 03:36:37.480
Hmm.

03:36:41.480 --> 03:36:42.480
Hmm.

03:36:45.480 --> 03:36:46.480
Hmm.

03:36:49.480 --> 03:36:50.480
Is this safe?

03:36:50.480 --> 03:36:51.480
Hmm, safe.

03:37:08.480 --> 03:37:10.480
Very convenient buckets.

03:37:15.480 --> 03:37:16.480
Rooftops.

03:37:20.480 --> 03:37:21.480
Hmm.

03:37:25.480 --> 03:37:27.480
I don't like this.

03:37:27.480 --> 03:37:28.480
Scary.

03:37:51.480 --> 03:37:52.480
Hmm.

03:37:53.480 --> 03:37:54.480
Hmm.

03:38:15.480 --> 03:38:16.480
Eh.

03:38:21.480 --> 03:38:22.480
Hmm.

03:38:45.480 --> 03:38:46.480
Hmm.

03:38:51.480 --> 03:38:52.480
Hmm.

03:38:55.480 --> 03:38:57.480
Aha, I can get me.

03:39:04.480 --> 03:39:06.480
Oh, where we go?

03:39:06.480 --> 03:39:07.480
From here?

03:39:07.480 --> 03:39:08.480
Up there?

03:39:10.480 --> 03:39:11.480
No, this way.

03:39:18.480 --> 03:39:19.480
Remember?

03:39:21.480 --> 03:39:22.480
Hmm.

03:39:29.480 --> 03:39:31.480
The city is full of neon.

03:39:32.480 --> 03:39:33.480
There's a noise this way.

03:39:35.480 --> 03:39:37.480
There used to be strict energy caps.

03:39:38.480 --> 03:39:40.480
Especially in the salt slums.

03:39:42.480 --> 03:39:44.480
But people couldn't handle the constant darkness.

03:39:46.480 --> 03:39:49.480
One day someone lit up ramble lamps.

03:39:50.480 --> 03:39:53.480
Nian signs all over their house.

03:39:54.480 --> 03:39:57.480
That person was taken away and never seen again.

03:39:58.480 --> 03:40:00.480
But people saw hope.

03:40:00.480 --> 03:40:05.480
And not long after, everyone started putting lots of lights in their homes.

03:40:07.480 --> 03:40:10.480
There was nothing to the oppressors could do.

03:40:11.480 --> 03:40:14.480
It was a way for the people to see color again.

03:40:14.480 --> 03:40:17.480
Like on the outside, I think it helped.

03:40:20.480 --> 03:40:21.480
Hmm.

03:40:45.480 --> 03:40:46.480
Hmm.

03:40:50.480 --> 03:40:51.480
Hmm.

03:40:53.480 --> 03:40:55.480
Do we go that way?

03:41:20.480 --> 03:41:21.480
Hmm.

03:41:21.480 --> 03:41:22.480
Hmm.

03:41:22.480 --> 03:41:23.480
Hmm.

03:41:23.480 --> 03:41:24.480
Hmm.

03:41:24.480 --> 03:41:25.480
Hmm.

Am I missing anything?

03:43:44.480 --> 03:43:46.480
Am I missing anything?

03:44:10.960 --> 03:44:12.960
Oh, what the?

03:44:15.280 --> 03:44:17.280
Oh

Oh boy

03:44:32.720 --> 03:44:34.720
This is so gross

03:44:45.440 --> 03:44:56.320
It's all sticky. Yeah, it's super sticky and it makes really gross wet noises. It's like

03:44:59.760 --> 03:45:01.760
It's really gross

03:45:03.680 --> 03:45:05.680

03:46:23.200 --> 03:46:25.920
How do you turn this off? I turned it on by accident

03:46:28.720 --> 03:46:33.760
How do you turn off the light? How do you turn off the light? I turned it on by accident

03:46:44.640 --> 03:46:46.640
Oh

03:46:57.440 --> 03:47:04.000
Niko ni niko korp they're responsible for waste management

03:47:04.000 --> 03:47:14.720
As trash from the upper levels overloaded the slums to try to develop bacteria to dissolve at all

03:47:16.560 --> 03:47:23.360
After the humans disappeared that bacteria mutated growing eating way more than trash

03:47:24.800 --> 03:47:29.120
And now we have zirks. Oh, no, let's go

03:47:29.440 --> 03:47:31.440
Oh

03:47:32.960 --> 03:47:34.960
It's all sticky

03:47:59.360 --> 03:48:01.360
Oh

03:48:13.600 --> 03:48:15.600
Ah

03:48:29.120 --> 03:48:31.120
Oh

03:48:41.520 --> 03:48:43.520
Wait don't I need this open?

03:48:46.560 --> 03:48:48.560
Wait don't I need this open?

03:48:54.400 --> 03:48:56.400
Like this

03:48:59.120 --> 03:49:01.120
Oh

03:49:18.560 --> 03:49:20.560
Oh

03:49:22.080 --> 03:49:24.080
Oh, thank you

03:49:29.120 --> 03:49:31.120
Oh

03:50:00.000 --> 03:50:02.000
Da

03:50:24.640 --> 03:50:26.640
This is treachery

03:50:27.600 --> 03:50:29.600
This is treachery

03:50:47.280 --> 03:50:49.280
I have no clue what's happening

03:50:50.240 --> 03:50:53.280
I don't know I thought it was a force restart

03:50:53.840 --> 03:50:57.760
But I don't a force update, but I checked to see

03:50:59.120 --> 03:51:04.000
I went to go check to see if my computer even has like even is on

03:51:04.400 --> 03:51:11.440
To update for anything during this time and it's not it's not it's not set to update during this time

03:51:11.760 --> 03:51:14.080
So it wasn't a force restart. I have no clue

03:51:14.400 --> 03:51:17.120
My computer keeps turning off on me

03:51:18.720 --> 03:51:23.120
It keeps turning off or restarting on its own and I have no clue why

03:51:27.280 --> 03:51:34.800
I have no clue why I'm such bad luck. It's so bad. I don't know what's happening

03:51:44.080 --> 03:51:46.080
Oh

03:52:01.280 --> 03:52:03.760
It's not my internet my internet is fine like

03:52:05.760 --> 03:52:09.520
Fairly getting fixed my internet is perfectly fine at the moment

03:52:10.560 --> 03:52:12.560
So it's not my internet

03:52:12.880 --> 03:52:19.440
Because if it was my internet then that would have turned off then that would have turned off and so would have this would have turned off

03:52:19.520 --> 03:52:22.000
And so would have my fan and so my

03:52:22.480 --> 03:52:26.480
Little broken half broken mini fridge would have also turned off

03:52:27.040 --> 03:52:29.040
But no

03:52:29.280 --> 03:52:32.160
So it's not my power. It's not my internet

03:52:32.800 --> 03:52:37.120
Because the little bar thingy didn't pop up if it was the internet it wouldn't turn off my

03:52:38.320 --> 03:52:40.320
Computer if it was the internet

03:52:41.280 --> 03:52:47.600
Instead it would just disconnect me and then reconnect me disconnect me reconnect me, but if it was power

03:52:48.640 --> 03:52:52.240
If it was power half of this side of my room would turn off

03:52:53.920 --> 03:52:55.920
If it was power

03:52:56.960 --> 03:53:01.360
But everything else is still on and running just fine. So I don't know what it is

03:53:03.920 --> 03:53:05.920
We'll figure it out

03:53:06.880 --> 03:53:08.880
later

03:53:09.760 --> 03:53:11.760
We'll figure it out

03:53:13.760 --> 03:53:15.760
Uh

03:53:17.280 --> 03:53:19.280
For now I can like uh

03:53:24.400 --> 03:53:29.040
I don't know turn this down. It's not any of this like I checked

03:53:30.960 --> 03:53:35.280
My cpu everything is running everything is running smoothly

03:53:35.840 --> 03:53:41.280
Very smoothly. Look at that everything rings running completely smoothly

03:53:45.760 --> 03:53:47.760
Yeah, this is fine

03:53:48.560 --> 03:53:50.400
This is fine

03:53:50.400 --> 03:53:53.040
So is this so is this this is okay

03:53:54.320 --> 03:53:56.320
Everything's fine

03:53:58.000 --> 03:54:00.000
Yeah later

03:54:05.920 --> 03:54:16.240
I'm gonna keep this on in the background so I can look at it just to see how it is. I'm playing

03:54:24.960 --> 03:54:26.800
Like the purring and he's gonna come back in

03:54:28.880 --> 03:54:30.880
At least it stopped right where we left off

03:54:31.520 --> 03:54:33.520
And

03:54:48.320 --> 03:54:52.800
This is a PC on its last legs impossible. It's a completely brand new rig

03:54:53.280 --> 03:54:59.760
There's no way that it could be on its last legs my old computer. Yeah, that was on its last legs

03:54:59.840 --> 03:55:01.840
But this is completely new

03:55:01.920 --> 03:55:03.920
There's no way

03:55:04.240 --> 03:55:07.200
I just have horrible luck when it comes to technology

03:55:08.480 --> 03:55:10.480
That I know

03:55:10.640 --> 03:55:12.640
That I know my head is big hang on

03:55:15.520 --> 03:55:17.520
That I know

03:55:17.920 --> 03:55:19.920
Oh

03:55:33.280 --> 03:55:36.080
Oh, we have to do all of this again. Oh man

03:55:48.080 --> 03:55:57.520
We need stronti and tekken. Right now main sound will help me with whatever needs to be done

03:56:00.240 --> 03:56:02.240
It will help

03:56:03.040 --> 03:56:10.240
They were responsible for waste management. Oh, yeah, we already read all of this

03:56:12.000 --> 03:56:17.360
Main sound has been helping me with everything else. So

03:56:17.520 --> 03:56:20.880
Bar we still can't figure it out meds. Oh, yeah, I haven't taken that

03:56:21.440 --> 03:56:24.080
Let me take that right now. There's heart medication

It's like a little ball.

04:10:55.740 --> 04:11:01.740
It was his favorite. He used to pick it up and walk around with it.

04:11:02.740 --> 04:11:06.740
He would like zoom across the floor with it.

04:11:14.740 --> 04:11:18.740
I can't. Where is it? Speech bubble.

A little outside of your reading this. That means you're still alive. Excellent.

04:11:27.740 --> 04:11:32.740
I took some equipment to the bar to take advantage of the antenna.

04:11:32.740 --> 04:11:35.740
Come meet me there.

04:11:35.740 --> 04:11:40.740
I've locked the window but the code to open it is quite simple.

04:11:40.740 --> 04:11:43.740
It is.

04:11:43.740 --> 04:11:46.740
That's supposed to be simple? The fuck?

04:11:46.740 --> 04:11:50.740
It's not fucking simple.

04:11:50.740 --> 04:11:55.740
Be careful. It is case sensitive. See, you have the bar.

04:11:55.740 --> 04:11:59.740
Whoa, whoa.

04:11:59.740 --> 04:12:04.740
That must be the code for the window near the entrance. Let's go.

04:12:04.740 --> 04:12:09.740
Chad, remember that? Remember that? Remember the code for me?

04:12:14.740 --> 04:12:19.740

04:12:33.740 --> 04:12:37.740

04:12:37.740 --> 04:12:41.740

04:22:26.560 --> 04:22:28.560
Not enough power.

04:22:33.560 --> 04:22:35.560
How to go down? Go down.

04:22:36.560 --> 04:22:37.560
Release me.

04:22:43.560 --> 04:22:47.560
I will get you to move one way or another.

04:22:51.560 --> 04:22:53.560
You want something?

04:22:54.560 --> 04:22:56.560
No, aren't you sitting earlier?

04:23:09.560 --> 04:23:10.560
Oh.

04:23:13.560 --> 04:23:14.560
No.

04:23:27.560 --> 04:23:30.560
Let me see if I can get this thing working.

04:23:38.560 --> 04:23:40.560
I almost got it.

04:23:43.560 --> 04:23:47.560
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

04:23:48.560 --> 04:23:50.560
Hello? Yes, we can hear you.

04:23:50.560 --> 04:23:53.560
We're from the slums. We're looking for a way out and...

04:23:53.560 --> 04:23:55.560
What is that? You?

04:23:56.560 --> 04:23:57.560
Balzahar?

04:23:58.560 --> 04:23:59.560
Mama?

04:24:02.560 --> 04:24:06.560
I can't believe it. I'm so happy to hear your voice, Balzahar.

04:24:07.560 --> 04:24:08.560
Where are you?

04:24:08.560 --> 04:24:10.560
Are the others okay?

04:24:11.560 --> 04:24:14.560
Yes, we are safe. We found a way out.

04:24:17.560 --> 04:24:18.560
Hello?

04:24:18.560 --> 04:24:20.560
Can you still hear me?

04:24:20.560 --> 04:24:23.560
You have to go through the sewers to reach us.

04:24:24.560 --> 04:24:27.560
Very dangerous. It lurks everywhere.

04:24:30.560 --> 04:24:32.560
Sewers? How? Hello?

04:24:33.560 --> 04:24:35.560
Darn it. We've lost the signal.

04:24:36.560 --> 04:24:39.560
I can't believe it. Balzahar is alive.

04:24:40.560 --> 04:24:44.560
He on the other outside has managed to go up through the sewers.

04:24:45.560 --> 04:24:48.560
The sewers are the most dangerous place in the slums.

04:24:48.560 --> 04:24:51.560
But if Balzahar made it, there must be a way.

04:25:03.560 --> 04:25:04.560
Seamus.

04:25:05.560 --> 04:25:08.560
Of course, it has to be someone named Seamus.

04:25:11.560 --> 04:25:12.560
I...

04:25:14.560 --> 04:25:17.560
You'll never get past the sewers.

04:25:17.560 --> 04:25:19.560
It's infested with serics.

04:25:19.560 --> 04:25:21.560
They'll make a quick meal out of you.

04:25:21.560 --> 04:25:23.560
Especially you, little one.

04:25:24.560 --> 04:25:26.560
Many try their luck in the past.

04:25:26.560 --> 04:25:28.560
It doesn't end well.

04:25:29.560 --> 04:25:32.560
Anyway, I warned you.

04:25:33.560 --> 04:25:35.560
Your business is none of my business.

04:25:41.560 --> 04:25:43.560
Seamus.

04:25:44.560 --> 04:25:48.560
His father, Doc, used to be a great scientist.

04:25:49.560 --> 04:25:52.560
He was working on some new weapon to fight the zirks.

04:25:53.560 --> 04:25:58.560
So, years ago, he went off to test the device and never came back.

04:25:59.560 --> 04:26:02.560
Seamus has never been the same since.

04:26:02.560 --> 04:26:05.560
Don't listen to Seamus. He's just scared like I was.

04:26:05.560 --> 04:26:10.560
If Doc build a weapon, that's our ticket to join the outsiders.

04:26:11.560 --> 04:26:15.560
And as notebook Doc mentioned, the secret lab a few times.

04:26:15.560 --> 04:26:17.560
That must be where he was working on it.

04:26:19.560 --> 04:26:21.560
There might be a clue.

04:26:22.560 --> 04:26:24.560
But I don't know.

04:26:25.560 --> 04:26:27.560
I don't know.

04:26:27.560 --> 04:26:29.560
I don't know where he was working on it.

04:26:30.560 --> 04:26:34.560
There might be a clue in Seamus' apartment.

04:26:34.560 --> 04:26:36.560
Go on, follow me.

04:26:45.560 --> 04:26:48.560
I follow Mr. Robot.

04:26:57.560 --> 04:27:00.560
I don't know where he was working on it.

04:27:00.560 --> 04:27:03.560
I don't know where he was working on it.

04:27:24.560 --> 04:27:26.560
Can you move it away?

04:27:26.560 --> 04:27:28.560
Grandma made a scarf. Isn't it wonderful?

04:27:29.560 --> 04:27:31.560
She knits so well.

04:27:57.560 --> 04:28:00.560
I don't know where he was working on it.

04:28:00.560 --> 04:28:02.560
I don't know where he was working on it.

04:28:02.560 --> 04:28:04.560
I don't know where he was working on it.

04:28:04.560 --> 04:28:06.560
I don't know where he was working on it.

04:28:06.560 --> 04:28:08.560
I don't know where he was working on it.

04:28:08.560 --> 04:28:10.560

04:28:10.560 --> 04:28:12.560

I don't know where he was working on it.

04:28:18.560 --> 04:28:20.560

04:28:20.560 --> 04:28:22.560

There's a secret room here, in our flat.

04:30:16.580 --> 04:30:18.580
But where?

04:30:27.580 --> 04:30:30.580
It's a very open area, we have there.

04:30:30.580 --> 04:30:32.580
Oh, I really can't carry that.

04:30:32.580 --> 04:30:35.580
Oh wait! Do you guys remember that code?

04:30:41.580 --> 04:30:43.580
What was the code again?

04:31:02.580 --> 04:31:04.580

04:31:10.580 --> 04:31:11.580

04:31:13.580 --> 04:31:14.580
What?

04:31:21.580 --> 04:31:22.580
Oh!

04:31:32.580 --> 04:31:34.580
Time will tell.

04:31:41.580 --> 04:31:43.580
Time will tell.

04:31:43.580 --> 04:31:44.580
Oh!

04:31:44.580 --> 04:31:46.580
Here, what's that?

04:31:47.580 --> 04:31:49.580

04:31:49.580 --> 04:31:51.580

04:31:56.580 --> 04:31:58.580
Two, five, one, one.

04:31:58.580 --> 04:32:00.580
Two...

04:32:04.580 --> 04:32:06.580

04:32:06.580 --> 04:32:08.580

04:32:08.580 --> 04:32:10.580

04:32:10.580 --> 04:32:12.580

04:32:12.580 --> 04:32:14.580

Two, five, one, one.

04:32:20.580 --> 04:32:23.580
What's the code that you guys have?

04:32:23.580 --> 04:32:25.580
What's that code for?

04:32:28.580 --> 04:32:29.580
Meow.

04:32:39.580 --> 04:32:41.580
Whoa.

04:32:41.580 --> 04:32:43.580
I've never seen this room.

04:32:43.580 --> 04:32:46.580
I can't believe you managed to hide it from me all this time.

04:32:47.580 --> 04:32:49.580
How was it for the safe?

04:32:49.580 --> 04:32:51.580
Oh, right. I forgot.

04:32:51.580 --> 04:32:53.580
Yeah.

04:32:53.580 --> 04:32:55.580
These blueprints...

04:32:55.580 --> 04:33:00.580
They must be for his zerk weapon.

04:33:00.580 --> 04:33:05.580
Papa was always so secretive with his work.

04:33:05.580 --> 04:33:08.580
He told me the weapon was working.

04:33:08.580 --> 04:33:12.580
In theory, but it needed a real life test.

04:33:12.580 --> 04:33:16.580
He went outside the slums, and he never came back.

04:33:29.580 --> 04:33:34.580
Robots, new headlines, zerk, are officially no longer under control.

04:33:35.580 --> 04:33:37.580
They now eat metal.

04:33:54.580 --> 04:33:57.580
The flux are blueprints.

04:33:57.580 --> 04:34:03.580
Concept, light-based, handgun, low-priority, visual-appearance-size,

04:34:03.580 --> 04:34:09.580
sceptile, emitted, high-priority, test in real condition,

04:34:09.580 --> 04:34:14.580
objective, 20 zerk destroyed per second.

04:34:28.580 --> 04:34:30.580
Let me down.

04:34:30.580 --> 04:34:32.580
Is there anything in here?

04:34:32.580 --> 04:34:34.580
Nothing, I don't know.

04:34:38.580 --> 04:34:43.580
I'm stuck. Get it off me! Get it off me!

04:34:43.580 --> 04:34:45.580
Okay, there you go.

04:34:48.580 --> 04:34:52.580
Anything up here? No?

04:34:57.580 --> 04:35:06.580
Observation.

04:35:06.580 --> 04:35:12.580
They now eat metal, then why haven't they eaten everything?

04:35:12.580 --> 04:35:16.580
Maybe because they take time? I don't know.

04:35:16.580 --> 04:35:19.580
Maybe it takes time. Maybe this is...

04:35:19.580 --> 04:35:22.580
They just developed into doing this.

04:35:23.580 --> 04:35:29.580
Maybe they become intelligent.

04:35:29.580 --> 04:35:35.580
Maybe there is smarter bacteria now.

04:35:35.580 --> 04:35:38.580
I need dwelling.

04:35:38.580 --> 04:35:42.580
They are just not that hungry.

04:35:42.580 --> 04:35:45.580
Cute sounds, but never friendly.

04:35:45.580 --> 04:35:47.580
Old bacteria of human time.

04:35:47.580 --> 04:35:50.580
Eat all kinds of materials.

04:35:50.580 --> 04:35:53.580
Total vision in the dark.

04:35:53.580 --> 04:35:55.580
React to intense light.

04:35:55.580 --> 04:35:57.580
I'll see, there you go.

04:35:57.580 --> 04:36:01.580
Maybe because light stops them.

04:36:01.580 --> 04:36:03.580
Maybe it's light.

04:36:03.580 --> 04:36:06.580
Light stops them.

04:36:06.580 --> 04:36:09.580
Am I missing something?

04:36:09.580 --> 04:36:11.580
Oh, a box.

04:36:21.580 --> 04:36:24.580
Find anything interesting in here?

04:36:24.580 --> 04:36:27.580
Yeah, this broken tracker.

04:36:30.580 --> 04:36:32.580
Wait, I remember that.

04:36:32.580 --> 04:36:34.580
That's his tracker.

04:36:34.580 --> 04:36:38.580
Papa always used that tracker to keep an eye on where I was.

04:36:38.580 --> 04:36:42.580
Maybe he can reverse it to find where he went.

04:36:42.580 --> 04:36:45.580
I can't believe my papa might still be alive.

04:36:45.580 --> 04:36:47.580
I missed him so much.

04:36:48.580 --> 04:36:51.580
You need a weapon for this herbs, right?

04:36:51.580 --> 04:36:53.580
My papa definitely took one with him.

04:36:56.580 --> 04:36:59.580
We just need to repair the tracker so we can find him.

04:36:59.580 --> 04:37:02.580
Someone in the slum should be able to help.

04:37:02.580 --> 04:37:05.580
Come with me. I'll open the door for you.

04:37:05.580 --> 04:37:07.580
Whoa.

04:37:07.580 --> 04:37:09.580
Where are we going?

04:37:09.580 --> 04:37:11.580
Where are we going?

04:37:17.580 --> 04:37:19.580
Meow.

04:37:19.580 --> 04:37:21.580
Meow.

04:37:24.580 --> 04:37:26.580
Meow.

04:37:32.580 --> 04:37:34.580
You gotta fix that tracker.

04:37:34.580 --> 04:37:36.580
You're resourceful.

04:37:36.580 --> 04:37:38.580
Maybe you can find someone in the slum to help.

04:37:38.580 --> 04:37:41.580
Alright, see you later, shameless.

04:37:47.580 --> 04:37:49.580
I'll see you later.

04:38:02.580 --> 04:38:05.580
You aren't always standing here. Who are you?

04:38:05.580 --> 04:38:08.580
Look at all this great stuff that falls at our tracks.

04:38:08.580 --> 04:38:10.580
So many treasures.

04:38:10.580 --> 04:38:14.580
You should go visit Bart, Barterman.

04:38:14.580 --> 04:38:17.580
There's something for everyone over there.

04:38:18.580 --> 04:38:20.580
Bart, Barterman.

04:38:20.580 --> 04:38:22.580
Barterman, yeah.

04:38:22.580 --> 04:38:24.580
Barterman.

04:38:27.580 --> 04:38:29.580
He's not Barterman.

04:38:29.580 --> 04:38:31.580
He's Azuz.

04:38:31.580 --> 04:38:33.580
Azuz.

04:38:33.580 --> 04:38:35.580
Azuz.

04:38:35.580 --> 04:38:37.580
Lito.

04:38:37.580 --> 04:38:39.580
Are you Barterman?

04:38:39.580 --> 04:38:41.580
Vinz?

04:38:41.580 --> 04:38:43.580
Where's Barterman?

04:38:44.580 --> 04:38:46.580
Bart, Barterman.

04:38:49.580 --> 04:38:51.580
Rosie?

04:38:55.580 --> 04:38:57.580
More keys?

04:38:57.580 --> 04:39:00.580
Oh, yeah. The code for this was the code for this.

04:39:00.580 --> 04:39:02.580
Oh, goodnight.

04:39:02.580 --> 04:39:06.580
Goodnight. Thank you for sleeping by today's stream.

04:39:06.580 --> 04:39:09.580
Sorry for all the crashes.

04:39:09.580 --> 04:39:11.580
Where are the crashes.

04:39:11.580 --> 04:39:13.580

We've been making good money lately.

04:41:30.920 --> 04:41:32.600

No, the merchant was the guy.

04:44:55.540 --> 04:44:59.540
Their name isn't Bradman.

04:44:59.540 --> 04:45:02.540
Yeah, their name's not Bradman.

04:45:02.540 --> 04:45:06.540
Yeah, it's Azuz.

04:45:06.540 --> 04:45:09.540
Azuz.

04:45:48.540 --> 04:45:51.540
What's that?

04:45:54.540 --> 04:45:57.540
Nickel plants grow in the dark.

04:45:57.540 --> 04:46:02.540
You don't need the sun to enjoy nature.

04:46:02.540 --> 04:46:04.540
Bradman.

04:46:04.540 --> 04:46:06.540

04:46:57.540 --> 04:47:02.540
Feels like a wild wire is coming out of his face.

04:47:02.540 --> 04:47:05.540
Hehehe.

04:47:05.540 --> 04:47:09.540
No, no, that's not Bradman.

04:47:13.540 --> 04:47:16.540
Am I just dumb?

04:47:16.540 --> 04:47:20.540
What the heck is Bradman?

04:47:20.540 --> 04:47:23.540
Bartering is to trade.

04:47:23.540 --> 04:47:27.540
It's Azuz?

04:47:27.540 --> 04:47:30.540
Barterman.

04:47:30.540 --> 04:47:35.540
Oh, oh, oh.

04:47:35.540 --> 04:47:37.540
Do I still talk to them?

04:47:37.540 --> 04:47:42.540
Do I talk to them? Do I show them stuff?

04:47:42.540 --> 04:47:46.540
No, I don't, I don't talk to them.

04:47:46.540 --> 04:47:49.540
See?

04:47:49.540 --> 04:47:52.540
Do they want something from me?

04:47:52.540 --> 04:47:55.540
And I don't?

04:47:56.540 --> 04:48:00.540

04:48:00.540 --> 04:48:03.540

04:48:03.540 --> 04:48:07.540
I'm stuck.

04:48:22.540 --> 04:48:24.540
I'm so lost.

04:48:24.540 --> 04:48:27.540
Uh...

04:48:30.540 --> 04:48:34.540
Does any of these give me a hint?

04:48:34.540 --> 04:48:39.540
This tracker is meant to find some sort of robot.

04:48:39.540 --> 04:48:43.540
Of course it's broken, we should find a way to repair it.

04:48:43.540 --> 04:48:49.540
Oh! I know! I know! I know! I know! Go fix it! I know!

04:48:49.540 --> 04:48:51.540

04:49:06.540 --> 04:49:09.540
Thanks for the poncho.

04:49:09.540 --> 04:49:11.540
Please come see if you ever need something fixed.

04:49:11.540 --> 04:49:14.540
Yeah, I need something fixed. Destiny.

04:49:14.540 --> 04:49:18.540
Oh wow, that's a great tracker. I recognize this model.

04:49:18.540 --> 04:49:25.540
It's Touhima BR2000.

04:49:25.540 --> 04:49:31.540
You can track anyone with this little gadget, may I?

04:49:31.540 --> 04:49:38.540
Let me take a look. Just gotta give it an update and one more thing. Voila!

04:49:42.540 --> 04:49:47.540
There you go, little one. Go look, find out who you're looking for.

04:49:47.540 --> 04:49:51.540
Thanks, Elliot!

04:49:51.540 --> 04:49:54.540
Elliot's so nice.

04:50:07.540 --> 04:50:10.540
Really nice. That's a great trait these days.

04:51:32.540 --> 04:51:35.540
You didn't. You fixed it a little done.

04:51:35.540 --> 04:51:37.540
Give me here.

04:51:38.540 --> 04:51:41.540
She's woke up.

04:51:41.540 --> 04:51:43.540

04:51:43.540 --> 04:51:46.540
Yeah, good morning.

04:51:49.540 --> 04:51:52.540
You have nice dreams.

04:51:58.540 --> 04:52:00.540
We got a ping.

04:52:00.540 --> 04:52:04.540
Is Papa really alive? I can't believe it.

04:52:04.540 --> 04:52:08.540
Let's follow the tracker. Maybe we'll find where my papa went.

We'll go read the mercy.

04:56:31.760 --> 04:56:35.760
Is there any sign of all the crashes that was happening throughout the rest of the game?

04:56:35.760 --> 04:56:37.760

04:56:37.760 --> 04:56:39.760

04:56:42.760 --> 04:56:45.760
We're excited that the crashes kept happening.

04:56:46.760 --> 04:56:49.760
It's so weird. I don't know why it was happening.

04:56:49.760 --> 04:56:51.760
We'll both figure it out.

04:56:51.760 --> 04:56:54.760

04:58:05.760 --> 04:58:07.760

04:58:14.760 --> 04:58:16.760

04:58:28.760 --> 04:58:30.760

04:58:31.760 --> 04:58:33.760
I'm not going anywhere just yet.

04:58:33.760 --> 04:58:35.760
Hang on a bit.

04:58:45.760 --> 04:58:47.760

04:58:48.760 --> 04:58:50.760

04:59:01.760 --> 04:59:03.760
Yeah, I'm still going to go for a moment.

04:59:03.760 --> 04:59:06.760
We're always going to chat for a little bit before I end.

04:59:06.760 --> 04:59:09.760
Usually, unless I'm in a rush to go.

04:59:10.760 --> 04:59:12.760
To go somewhere.

04:59:12.760 --> 04:59:14.760
But I'm not always in a rush.

04:59:14.760 --> 04:59:16.760

04:59:21.760 --> 04:59:23.760

they put honey in a fridge and they say some ketchup shouldn't be federated but i like ketchup

05:12:45.900 --> 05:12:53.580
federated it turns all like vinegary and smells bad unless you shake it if you take it out of the

05:12:53.580 --> 05:12:58.860
fridge they say ketchup shouldn't be federated but there are some ketchup bottles that they

05:12:58.860 --> 05:13:04.460
federate after opening but there are some ketchup bottles that they don't federate but people just

05:13:04.460 --> 05:13:13.180
don't read bottles anymore to make sure so they leave the ketchup um out of the fridge

05:13:13.260 --> 05:13:18.620
i think it's it tastes horrible and sour

05:13:22.140 --> 05:13:27.820
cold honey is cool yeah but you can't it won't it doesn't move but it becomes hard

05:13:35.740 --> 05:13:40.300
honey literally cannot go bad so there's no need to federate honey there isn't

05:13:41.260 --> 05:13:42.620
it doesn't need to be federated

05:13:45.740 --> 05:13:54.380
use a high spec for the honey i have some honey lemon tea a few days ago my throat because i

05:13:55.100 --> 05:13:58.220
was a discord carry okay hurt my throat

05:14:01.020 --> 05:14:04.140
a honey lemon tea is great how much honey do you do

05:14:10.940 --> 05:14:24.620
i have a hundred

05:14:26.140 --> 05:14:30.780
a hundred teabags probably a little less than that now because i've drunk a couple a

05:14:30.780 --> 05:14:37.900
couple of tea maybe like 80 something 80 teabags now

05:14:47.100 --> 05:14:49.100
a hundred yeah a hundred

05:14:53.100 --> 05:14:56.380
i don't like leaving my house like yeah i buy everything i need it

05:14:56.460 --> 05:15:03.580
but what is the expiration date does it have one does tea actually expire i don't think tea

05:15:03.580 --> 05:15:11.100
expires tea can't expire can it tea can't expire can it you really

05:15:14.780 --> 05:15:17.100
this fire there's no expiration date on this

05:15:20.620 --> 05:15:22.140
yeah it's not expiration date

05:15:27.340 --> 05:15:33.100
oh there is an expiration date oh

05:15:41.660 --> 05:15:49.100
i have till next year i'm fine it's fine i have till next year

05:15:49.420 --> 05:16:01.820
i have till February of next year we're fine

05:16:01.980 --> 05:16:04.540
okay

05:16:13.420 --> 05:16:16.540
how long does it take hot chocolate to expire

05:16:18.460 --> 05:16:23.020
i bought 150 of those i don't have the box i'm not gonna go look right now

05:16:32.380 --> 05:16:38.220
next year can pass really quickly with the treasury of tea such as yours i recommend drinking

05:16:38.220 --> 05:16:42.780
about two bags a day i get sick pretty cool frequently so it should be fine

05:16:45.100 --> 05:16:56.540
i get sick very frequently so it'll be used

05:17:01.900 --> 05:17:04.540
so

05:17:14.700 --> 05:17:18.540
i still play with my partner about sauce in the fridge it's mind boggling

05:17:21.980 --> 05:17:26.540
i think only some things should go in the fridge honestly

05:17:32.540 --> 05:17:38.940
only some things honey should be refrigerated it should it should not be

05:17:38.940 --> 05:17:43.580
refrigerated it doesn't say on the bottle that needs to be refrigerated literally google it

05:17:43.580 --> 05:17:51.260
and it will tell you that not all honey needs to be refrigerated i only put some sauces it says

05:17:51.260 --> 05:17:57.180
it on the bottles if it says on the bottle refrigerate after opening it i'm putting it in

05:17:57.180 --> 05:18:04.220
the refrigerator all right it says recommended put in refrigerator after opening and it's gonna go

05:18:04.220 --> 05:18:10.220
in the fridge all right if it says it i'm doing it

05:18:15.900 --> 05:18:19.660
well this is nonsense when you suck it on the bottle read it

05:18:27.500 --> 05:18:33.660
okay

05:18:37.660 --> 05:18:44.140
am i worried you guys gonna have gross expired spoiled food and still eat it because the

05:18:44.140 --> 05:18:50.460
expiration date says it doesn't expire well it doesn't expire until unless you treat it the

05:18:50.460 --> 05:18:56.220
way it says to be treated you you that's like leaving milk out and then saying oh well the

05:18:56.220 --> 05:19:01.020
expiration date says it doesn't expire until like next month but you just keep drinking it because

05:19:01.020 --> 05:19:10.380
you left it out for like a day and yeah well i don't need to refrigerate it because it doesn't

05:19:10.380 --> 05:19:14.780
say it needs to be refrigerated but everyone knows knows needs to be refrigerated so you

05:19:14.780 --> 05:19:27.900
refrigerate the milk just because it's got just because some milk can survive without being

05:19:27.900 --> 05:19:32.860
refrigerated doesn't mean not all milk because survive not being refrigerated the same goes for

05:19:32.860 --> 05:19:39.500
most other foods if it says it on a bottle you do what it says because they know better than you do

05:19:45.020 --> 05:19:49.660
that's like this one person i used to yell at me about refrigerating eggs

05:19:54.780 --> 05:19:59.100
they're like oh but if it came from a chicken then it doesn't need to be refrigerated

05:20:03.020 --> 05:20:07.500
the whole point of refrigerating most eggs was to stop fertilization

05:20:14.780 --> 05:20:29.100
keep them eggs cold

05:20:44.780 --> 05:20:55.940

අඩශ්දා ලැටනිරව

05:20:59.860 --> 05:21:07.860
I think they had this whole mental of eat things as soon as you get it, but they didn't really understand the concept of storing food.

05:21:09.860 --> 05:21:17.860
You put it in the fridge to keep it cold for a reason. You're keeping it cold for a reason.

05:21:30.860 --> 05:21:35.860
You put it in the fridge to keep it cold for a reason.

05:21:36.860 --> 05:21:41.860
Imagine leaving an egg out on the counter only to come home to a baby chick.

05:21:47.860 --> 05:21:53.860
That has actually happened to some people where they had a, like a chickie.

05:21:54.860 --> 05:21:59.860
It was like half formed in an egg because they left the egg out.

05:22:00.860 --> 05:22:07.860
It was like halfly formed and then when they broke it open, like a chickie came out.

05:22:13.860 --> 05:22:17.860
But it wasn't an alive chick though, unfortunately.

05:22:24.860 --> 05:22:29.860
I think they stopped eating eggs after that.

05:22:32.860 --> 05:22:36.860
Did they eat it? No, they were scared. They were shocked. They screamed.

05:22:47.860 --> 05:22:52.860
I think they stopped eating eggs after that. I think it was very traumatizing for them.

05:22:53.860 --> 05:22:58.860
I don't remember. I don't talk to them anymore.

05:22:59.860 --> 05:23:05.860
I just heard that this year apparently fresh non-processed eggs can be kept out on a counter and be fine.

05:23:06.860 --> 05:23:13.860
Yes, non-processed, non-processed, non-processed food can be left out.

05:23:14.860 --> 05:23:19.860
The majority of it can, but not processed food. It does not work that way.

05:23:19.860 --> 05:23:22.860
It does not work that way.

05:23:34.860 --> 05:23:40.860
Some people just don't really do that much research to find out that it's not that way.

05:23:41.860 --> 05:23:48.860
So they learn about this stuff online somewhere and then they never actually do self research to see if that information holds true.

05:23:49.860 --> 05:23:52.860
For everything.

05:23:53.860 --> 05:23:56.860
They just believe everything they hear and see.

05:24:00.860 --> 05:24:02.860
You're guilty almost.

05:24:04.860 --> 05:24:09.860
Do your research. Don't trust everything. So bully dilly.

05:24:10.860 --> 05:24:14.860
Do your research. Oh my gosh, silly babies.

05:24:15.860 --> 05:24:20.860
Do your research now.

05:24:22.860 --> 05:24:25.860
Common sense is kind of eroded nowadays.

05:24:27.860 --> 05:24:29.860
It's weird.

05:24:30.860 --> 05:24:36.860
Well, I want to do a full-on zazu zazu zazu down.

05:24:37.860 --> 05:24:38.860

05:24:42.860 --> 05:24:46.860
