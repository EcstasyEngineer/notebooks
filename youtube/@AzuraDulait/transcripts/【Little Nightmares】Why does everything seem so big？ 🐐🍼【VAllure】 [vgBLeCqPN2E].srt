00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

3
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

4
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

5
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You

6
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You

7
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You

8
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You

9
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You

10
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You

11
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You

12
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You

13
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You

14
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You

15
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You

16
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You

17
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You

18
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Hopefully they won't mind, hopefully.

19
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hey.

20
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Ugh.

21
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Stressful?

22
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Aw.

23
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Usually this helps out a lot of your work.

24
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Work can be very stressful.

25
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm hoping that your day gets better as we go.

26
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Way better now, that's good.

27
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Hugs friends, Laura?

28
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Thank you.

29
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Hmm.

30
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Far from that I'm not active.

31
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm currently watching an elderly dog for a friend.

32
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, I hope the dog is okay though.

33
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I mean, it never reminds me of when I was working with dogs.

34
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
There was this really old dog that was like,

35
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
obsessed with me.

36
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Will follow me everywhere.

37
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Will leave me alone.

38
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And the other ones which is lay on my lap.

39
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh no, won't buggy.

40
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Buggies are so cute.

41
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I love them.

42
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I like doggies a lot.

43
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Am I easily scared?

44
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Depends.

45
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Depends.

46
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I think my form of fear of games is,

47
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
of like a scary game is like,

48
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
the act of being like,

49
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
realistically chased.

50
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Sort of like, my biggest fear.

51
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The game that made me like, drool.

52
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
When I screamed.

53
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I think it was, um, Alien Isolation.

54
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't think anyone's ever gonna give me to play that game.

55
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What?

56
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't think anyone's gonna ever give me to play that game.

57
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Not in a million years.

58
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Sorry, I meant to go turn on my light.

59
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I didn't even make it past the tutorial.

60
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I didn't even finish the tutorial.

61
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's how scared I was of that game.

62
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Less than three?

63
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's funny.

64
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I love you too.

65
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Love you too.

66
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Thank you so much for the six dollars that we won.

67
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Thank you, thank you.

68
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Have you ever played Resident Evil or Death Space?

69
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I played a little bit of Death Space

70
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and I like the Resident Evil series, so yeah.

71
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Death Space is still kind of scary.

72
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Death Space is kind of very scary.

73
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Resident Evil not so much.

74
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't know.

75
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Ah, that big dog. Best toys ever.

76
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm very sorry.

77
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
My condolences were lost.

78
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
My body was a good doggy.

79
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Very good doggy.

80
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Me?

81
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm just reading, child.

82
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Sorry.

83
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's very hot. You're so squishy.

84
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Am I?

85
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Super soft and warm.

86
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Thank you.

87
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm not discouraged, don't worry.

88
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It might be disappointing as a whole, but don't worry.

89
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll be okay.

90
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh.

91
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I just hang on in there and keep on streaming like normal.

92
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I appreciate your concern, though.

93
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
A lot.

94
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And I don't think I'm the best out of the Villalor girls.

95
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I don't think I'm the best.

96
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Um.

97
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But I do appreciate that it's very sweet.

98
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Thank you for the $1.00 details, Villalor.

99
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
As a Villalor.

100
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I've been talking so much lately.

101
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You know, like when you work out and your muscles get sore?

102
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, thank you so much.

103
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You're so sweet.

104
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Thank you.

105
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Thank you for the $4.00.

106
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Thank you, Papa.

107
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Appreciate it.

108
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Thank you.

109
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You know how when you exercise and you work out and your muscles get sore?

110
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I've been talking so much that my, my neck, my actual neck is sore.

111
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It hurts to touch.

112
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I've been using my neck muscles.

113
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So much now that my throat is like sore.

114
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't really take any more morning pills or morning medication.

115
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
All my medication is always taken at night.

116
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Always at night.

117
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Speaking of which, let me turn off that alarm for today.

118
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Sorry to do that.

119
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Scared me.

120
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I read that wrong.

121
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Sorry.

122
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm so glad.

123
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I wish you good luck at a run.

124
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I hope you have a good stream.

125
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh, it's nice to you.

126
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Thank you for stopping by.

127
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Appreciate you.

128
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Um, how do you came to just say hello?

129
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Okay, um,

130
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I bought the hoodie and joggers.

131
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I can't wait for them.

132
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm excited.

133
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Well, thank you for buying the merch.

134
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Alright, I hope you enjoy and feel comfy and cozy and dumb.

135
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Appreciate you.

136
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Thank you.

137
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:46,000
If anyone else wants merch, go ahead and just go in the description down below and you can get your merch there.

138
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I hope you spend another great day with you, especially since I had a very bad day at work.

139
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm sorry you had a really bad day at work.

140
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I hope that you enjoy your time here and the stream and you feel much better as we play.

141
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Thank you so much for $5 to be all for fun.

142
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Thank you, thank you.

143
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Because you said big yawn, I ended up yawning.

144
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I was trying to hold it in.

145
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Look what you did.

146
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I need to turn this up, so give me one second.

147
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Let me turn this up.

148
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Alright, can you guys hear me a little better?

149
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Is this better or worse?

150
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Better or worse?

151
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Or can I be a little louder?

152
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I think it should be fine.

153
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Right here?

154
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Oh goodness.

155
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Okay, I don't want to make too loud of a noise or something.

156
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's going to be extremely loud because small noises that I make can get really loud.

157
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So I just want to be careful about that.

158
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
More Pog.

159
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Pog?

160
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Pog.

161
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Pog.

162
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Ah.

163
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Ah.

164
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Ah.

165
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Are you guys ready to play?

166
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I have none, I don't really, I didn't, oh.

167
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I mean, I don't want you guys to worry.

168
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't want to, I didn't want to tell you about this.

169
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I didn't want you guys to worry.

170
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I sat here and I debated it in my head.

171
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Should I tell them?

172
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Should I tell them?

173
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Okay, okay.

174
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Okay, okay, okay.

175
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's not bad, it's really not bad.

176
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's okay, it's fine.

177
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I have like a vacuum cleaner and I was cleaning up and the vacuum pinched my finger.

178
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's fine.

179
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The swelling went down a little bit.

180
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I keep playing with my finger.

181
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's like a little purple on one side.

182
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's like purple on the part that got pinched.

183
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Like purple and numb.

184
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I have sensitive skin.

185
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
If I got like tapped, like that area is going to turn purple.

186
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's normal, it's normal, it's normal.

187
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Do not be worried, it's fine.

188
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I think it's fine.

189
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I was just contemplating on whether or not my finger is okay.

190
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
She's a scared toe.

191
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm not losing my toe, my toe is fine.

192
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And I said I pinched my finger, not my toe.

193
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Can I guess the booboo?

194
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
If she's going to kiss the booboo.

195
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yes, you can kiss the booboo.

196
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah, you can kiss the booboo.

197
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
No, not my precious vacuum.

198
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It keeps my floor clean.

199
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I might be like, I might have clutter in my room,

200
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
but I really don't like crumbs.

201
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Crumbs annoy me.

202
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But I don't hurt my vacuum.

203
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I don't like, I really like to keep things tidy in a specific way.

204
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm sorry, that was my OCD speaking.

205
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I had slight panic in my brain about my vacuum being broken,

206
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and it made me feel very sad.

207
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
No, not the vacuum, please.

208
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
No, no.

209
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Mm-hmm.

210
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Viking funeral for a vacuum.

211
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Wow.

212
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Wow.

213
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Okay, what is this?

214
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh, I'm ready when I'm not.

215
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I thought I was ready.

216
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm not ready.

217
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm not ready, I'm not ready, you know.

218
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Booboo.

219
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Where does this keep coming from?

220
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I always delete this, and it always comes back.

221
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That's so strange.

222
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Mm-hmm.

223
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's very strange.

224
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's not super scuffed, what do you mean?

225
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's fine, we're not scuffed yet.

226
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
We're fine, we're fine.

227
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I do not have malware issues.

228
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I was only deleting a file on OBS that somehow keeps coming back.

229
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It won't go away.

230
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Leave me alone, go away.

231
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I used to one time, leave me alone.

232
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
We're fine, we're fine.

233
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Okay, now I turn this off.

234
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Okay.

235
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Oh, like this.

236
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Oh, we got it.

237
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Yay.

238
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Now he's going to switch over now and prepares for the games.

239
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Ha ha ha.

240
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
See, no scoof.

241
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
We're fine, no scoof.

242
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
No scoof, no scoof.

243
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
No, no, no.

244
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
No, no.

245
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
No, scoof.

246
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
No, scoof.

247
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
No, scoof.

248
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
No, no, no.

249
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Mm-hmm.

250
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh

251
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:38,400
Should I dim the lights for me for your eyes for your eyes

252
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,520
Like this

00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,760
Like that

254
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,800
You like that

255
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
Yay

256
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,280

I do here. I can't see it

261
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,480
This is barely visible for me

262
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
Am I blind?

263
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
Oh, right. I am

This is my first time playing the first top one. I'm not too sure. I don't really remember much from this game

315
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:29,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

316
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:39,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

317
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:48,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

318
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:58,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

319
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:08,440
I don't know what I'm talking about.

320
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:23,440
What is that?

321
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:37,440
Ew.

322
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,440
No, I'm scared.

323
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:47,440
I'm so nervous. I don't even know what to say. You don't understand. I'm so scared.

324
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,440
I'm so scared.

325
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:59,440
I'm so scared. I'm so nervous. Am I supposed to be back here?

326
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,440
Do I have to take out the lighter?

327
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:19,440
That's a wall.

328
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:41,440
No, bring that back. It's dark.

329
00:42:41,440 --> 00:43:01,440
Okay, what do I do in here?

330
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:29,440
I'm really not good with puzzles. I don't think there'd be puzzles in here.

331
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,440
Can I push that?

332
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:50,440
Yeah, I noticed the handprint on the fridge.

333
00:43:50,440 --> 00:44:03,440
Can I grab this? No, I can't grab anything.

334
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:11,440
I thought I had to push this or something, but I can't do that either.

335
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:40,440
I can't climb up here.

336
00:44:40,440 --> 00:45:09,440
I think I have to be in this room.

337
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:38,440
Okay, the little thing ran over here.

338
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:47,440
Is it on here? Oh, yes.

339
00:45:47,440 --> 00:46:09,440
The nose.

340
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,440
I can't take a win me.

341
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:38,440
I can't jump. You just hold the button and hold up.

342
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:51,440
I can't climb.

343
00:46:51,440 --> 00:47:04,440
Is that a reach?

344
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:24,440
I can't reach.

345
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:53,440
I can't reach.

346
00:47:53,440 --> 00:48:02,440
I can't reach.

347
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:22,440
I can't reach.

348
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:43,440
I can't run. Where am I supposed to go?

349
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:59,440
No! It wouldn't let me run. I couldn't run.

350
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:28,440
This way, I think.

351
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:38,440
Climb. Climb. There you go.

352
00:49:38,440 --> 00:50:00,440
Uh-oh.

353
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:29,440
I'm not scared of you.

354
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:40,440
I'm not scared of you.

355
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:39,440
I'm so nervous.

356
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:49,440
There's another thingy.

357
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,440
What is that on the door?

358
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:58,440
Isn't that eyeball?

359
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:13,440
Is this toilet?

360
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:28,440
Did you see that?

361
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:57,440
I'm not scared of you.

362
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:07,440
I'm not scared of you.

363
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:27,440
I'm not scared of you.

364
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:52,440
I can't reach that. It's too high up.

365
00:53:53,440 --> 00:54:10,440
That's a timer.

366
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:17,440
Why is there kids toys?

367
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:40,440
Yeah. That's kind of scary.

368
00:54:40,440 --> 00:55:00,440
I'm not scared of you.

369
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:09,440
That's nice.

370
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:29,440
I'm not scared of you.

371
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:39,440
I'm not scared of you.

372
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:49,440
I'm not scared of you.

373
00:55:49,440 --> 00:56:09,440
I'm not scared of you.

374
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:29,440
I'm not scared of you.

375
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:36,440
Are we supposed to come back in here?

376
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,440
Do we have to run all the way across the room?

377
00:56:40,440 --> 00:57:07,440
Like really fast?

378
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:13,440
Is there anything in the way?

379
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:42,440
I'm not scared of you.

380
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:53,440
This isn't very dangerous.

381
00:57:53,440 --> 00:58:00,440
Nah.

382
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,440
I don't like that.

383
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:14,440
It's my lucky block.

384
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:38,440
Is it something that can hear me?

385
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:58,440
I can't take the block with me.

386
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:27,440
Can I jump and climb now?

387
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:34,440
Can I go up?

388
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:42,440
I want to help them.

389
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:51,440
I'll climb up.

390
00:59:51,440 --> 01:00:08,440
With this?

391
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,440
I thought he was trapped.

392
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:16,440
Are they not trapped?

393
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:28,440
What's up here?

394
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:39,440
I am lucky.

395
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:52,440
I don't know which way to go.

396
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:59,440
I don't know which way to go.

397
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:09,440
I don't know which way to go.

398
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:19,440
I don't know which way to go.

399
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:29,440
I don't know which way to go.

400
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:49,440
I don't know which way to go.

401
01:01:49,440 --> 01:02:14,440
I know me.

402
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:24,440
I don't know which way to go.

403
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:44,440
I don't know which way to go.

404
01:02:44,440 --> 01:03:04,440
I don't know which way to go.

405
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:14,440
I don't know which way to go.

406
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:42,440
I'm scared.

407
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:52,440
I don't know which way to go.

408
01:03:52,440 --> 01:04:12,440
I don't know which way to go.

409
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:22,440
I don't know which way to go.

410
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:32,440
I don't know which way to go.

411
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:42,440
I don't know which way to go.

412
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:52,440
I don't know which way to go.

413
01:04:52,440 --> 01:05:02,440
I don't know which way to go.

414
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:22,440
I don't know which way to go.

415
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:42,440
I don't know which way to go.

416
01:05:42,440 --> 01:06:02,440
I don't know which way to go.

417
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:22,440
I don't know which way to go.

418
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:32,440
We're hungry.

419
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:42,440
We're hungry.

420
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:52,440
I know this feeling on too well.

421
01:06:52,440 --> 01:07:02,440
I'm going to give it to me.

422
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:12,440
Was that bread? Why is it so squelchy?

423
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:24,440
Thank you.

424
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:38,440
What did I eat? Was that bread?

425
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:44,440
My dear mommy, you got this. I've got some free time so I'll watch you.

426
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,440
Thank you. I appreciate that.

427
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:56,440
Thank you for the $5 tipi.

428
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:02,440
I hope you'll join me in your free time.

429
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:20,440
It's a noose.

430
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:40,440
It's too shower.

431
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:54,440
There's so many cages.

432
01:08:54,440 --> 01:09:06,440
I got to remember that you don't press space when climbing. Do not press space.

433
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:16,440
What was that?

434
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:42,440
What was that?

435
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:58,440
Now what?

436
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:14,440
What was that?

437
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:34,440
What was that?

438
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:52,440
That noise.

439
01:10:52,440 --> 01:11:16,440
Am I supposed to do something with this?

440
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:36,440
What was that?

441
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:52,440
That's a long fall.

442
01:11:52,440 --> 01:12:14,440
Is that supposed to be up here?

443
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:32,440
I pressed space by accident.

444
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:40,440
Can I push this? No.

445
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:48,440
I won't get it.

446
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:52,440
What am I supposed to do here?

447
01:12:52,440 --> 01:13:06,440
I climbed that.

448
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:16,440
Keep climbing.

449
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:28,440
Not then.

450
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:46,440
There's a little water here. What did this go to?

451
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:56,440
What do you pull first?

452
01:13:56,440 --> 01:14:06,440
What was that?

453
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:16,440
What was that?

454
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:44,440
I'm a genius.

455
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:54,440
I'm a genius.

456
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:38,440
I can't let me climb it now.

457
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:48,440
I'm stuck.

458
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:58,440
I'm stuck.

459
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:18,440
I'm stuck.

460
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:28,440
I'm stuck.

461
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:56,440
I'm stuck.

462
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:06,440
I'm stuck.

463
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:16,440
I'm stuck.

464
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:42,440
Nothing else in here?

465
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:52,440
I'm stuck.

466
01:17:52,440 --> 01:18:12,440
I'm stuck.

467
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:22,440
I'm stuck.

468
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:32,440
I'm stuck.

469
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:52,440
I'm stuck.

470
01:18:52,440 --> 01:19:02,440
I'm stuck.

471
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:12,440
I'm stuck.

472
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:22,440
I'm stuck.

473
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:48,440
I'm stuck.

474
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:58,440
I'm stuck.

475
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:08,440
I'm stuck.

476
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:18,440
I'm stuck.

477
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:28,440
I'm stuck.

478
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:48,440
I'm stuck.

479
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:58,440
Hey, isn't this where it was before?

480
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:08,440
Where are the children?

481
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:24,440
Oh, no.

482
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:40,440
Why is this area all of a sudden really dark and scary?

483
01:21:40,440 --> 01:22:00,440
I don't like this camera angle. Why do I feel like something's going to come?

484
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:28,440
I'm stuck.

485
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:38,440
I'm stuck.

486
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:48,440
I'm stuck.

487
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:58,440
I'm stuck.

488
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:18,440
I'm stuck.

489
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:44,440
I'm stuck.

490
01:23:44,440 --> 01:24:00,440
I'm stuck.

491
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:26,440
I don't know what sound came out of me.

492
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:36,440
Why is this so scary? I don't like that. It's scary.

493
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:52,440
It's so scary.

494
01:24:52,440 --> 01:25:16,440
I'm stuck.

495
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:36,440
I'm stuck.

496
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:54,440
That was dark.

497
01:25:54,440 --> 01:26:02,440
Oh, it's the gnomes.

498
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:22,440
I made it out.

499
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:32,440
I'm stuck.

500
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:42,440
I'm stuck.

501
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:52,440
I'm stuck.

502
01:26:52,440 --> 01:27:12,440
I'm stuck.

503
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:32,440
I'm stuck.

504
01:27:32,440 --> 01:28:00,440
I'm stuck.

505
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:10,440
I'm stuck.

506
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:20,440
I'm stuck.

507
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:30,440
I'm stuck.

508
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:40,440
I want to go up there. I want to know what's up there.

509
01:28:40,440 --> 01:29:06,440
What's up here? Am I going to fall again?

510
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:16,440
What's in here?

511
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:56,440
Am I going to fall again?

512
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:06,440
Am I going to fall again?

513
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:16,440
Am I going to fall again?

514
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:36,440
Am I going to fall again?

515
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:58,440
I don't know what's in there.

516
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:18,440
Is this an entire area?

517
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:28,440
It's not open.

518
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:38,440
I can't see.

519
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:48,440
It's a floor.

520
01:31:48,440 --> 01:32:02,440
If I go in there, then I can't go up the stairs.

521
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:30,440
The chair.

522
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:40,440
I want to know what's up the stairs.

523
01:32:40,440 --> 01:33:08,440
What's up here?

524
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:28,440
It's a door.

525
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:36,440
What if I fall?

526
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:46,440
The stairs are evil.

527
01:33:46,440 --> 01:34:14,440
Can I leave?

528
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:34,440
I'm stuck.

529
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:54,440
I want to go back.

530
01:34:54,440 --> 01:35:04,440
I didn't want to go.

531
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:14,440
I shouldn't have come up here.

532
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:42,440
Am I going to fall again?

533
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:52,440
Am I going to fall again?

534
01:35:52,440 --> 01:36:12,440
Am I going to fall?

535
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:32,440
Am I going to fall again?

536
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:52,440
Am I going to fall again?

537
01:36:52,440 --> 01:37:02,440
Yeah.

538
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:22,440
Am I going to fall again?

539
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:38,440
I can't always do this key, not that we have a key.

540
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:58,440
I don't know what's that.

541
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:18,440
Am I going to fall again?

542
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:38,440
Am I going to fall again?

543
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:48,440
Am I going to fall again?

544
01:38:48,440 --> 01:39:08,440
Am I going to fall again?

545
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:28,440
Am I going to fall again?

546
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:48,440
Am I going to fall again?

547
01:39:48,440 --> 01:40:08,440
Am I going to fall again?

548
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:28,440
Am I going to fall again?

549
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:48,440
Am I going to fall again?

550
01:40:48,440 --> 01:41:08,440
Am I going to fall again?

551
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:28,440
Am I going to fall again?

552
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:48,440
Am I going to fall again?

553
01:41:48,440 --> 01:42:08,440
Am I going to fall again?

554
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:28,440
Am I going to fall again?

555
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:48,440
Am I going to fall again?

556
01:42:48,440 --> 01:43:02,440
Dang, no sympathy.

557
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:28,440
What's over here?

558
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:40,440
Wait, am I going to make that?

559
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:50,440
How do I make that?

560
01:43:50,440 --> 01:44:00,440
Downstairs, evil stairs.

561
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:10,440
Do I just run?

562
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:38,440
I'm doing it.

563
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:58,440
Now the game wants to start giving me advice.

564
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:18,440
How do I get in there?

565
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:42,440
How do I get in there?

566
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:52,440
What's the kid?

567
01:45:52,440 --> 01:46:10,440
Is the kid alive?

568
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:20,440
They're definitely still alive, right?

569
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:30,440
How do I get in there?

570
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:40,440
How do I get in there?

571
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:50,440
How do I get in there?

572
01:46:50,440 --> 01:47:00,440
How do I get in there?

573
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:20,440
How do I get in there?

574
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:30,440
How do I get in there?

575
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:50,440
How do I get in there?

576
01:47:50,440 --> 01:48:18,440
How do I get in there?

577
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:28,440
What am I supposed to do?

578
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:38,440
How do I get in there?

579
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:48,440
How do I get in there?

580
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:58,440

581
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:18,440
How do I get in there?

582
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:28,440
How do I get in there?

583
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:54,440
I did it.

584
01:49:54,440 --> 01:50:14,440
Why is this so loud?

585
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:24,440
How do I get in there?

586
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:44,440

587
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:54,440

01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:14,440
How do I get in there?

590
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:34,440
How do I get in there?

591
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:44,440
How do I get in there?

592
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:54,440
How do I get in there?

593
01:51:54,440 --> 01:52:04,440
How do I get in there?

594
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:14,440
How do I get in there?

595
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:24,440
How do I get in there?

596
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:34,440
How do I get in there?

597
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:44,440
How do I get in there?

598
01:52:44,440 --> 01:52:54,440
How do I get in there?

599
01:52:54,440 --> 01:53:04,440
How do I get in there?

600
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:14,440
How do I get in there?

601
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:24,440

How do I get in there?

608
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:34,440
How do I get in there?

609
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:44,440
How do I get in there?

610
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:54,440

How do I get in there?

620
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:44,440
Hang on, give me one second.

621
01:56:44,440 --> 01:57:04,440
I need a second.

622
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:14,440
I need a second, give me a second.

623
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:26,440
How can people play that so normally, like nonchalant, like just be so unfair, I don't understand how you guys do that.

624
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:38,440
I don't understand.

625
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:52,440
I'm so sad, my mom isn't here, she's not going to be here for a couple of days again.

626
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:58,440
She's like never here, she's like never home.

627
01:57:58,440 --> 01:58:04,440
She left me something and I can get something.

628
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:12,440
So give me one moment, I want to order something.

629
01:58:12,440 --> 01:58:20,440
Give me a moment.

630
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:22,440
Yeah.

631
01:58:50,440 --> 01:59:00,440
Yeah.

632
01:59:00,440 --> 01:59:10,440
Yeah.

633
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:20,440
Yeah.

634
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:40,440
Yeah.

635
01:59:40,440 --> 02:00:00,440
Yeah.

636
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:20,440
Yeah.

637
02:00:20,440 --> 02:00:40,440
Yeah.

638
02:00:40,440 --> 02:01:00,440
Yeah.

639
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:28,440
Yeah.

640
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:56,440
Yeah.

641
02:01:56,440 --> 02:02:22,440
Yeah.

642
02:02:22,440 --> 02:02:48,440
Yeah.

643
02:02:48,440 --> 02:03:14,440
This heart monitor sucks for people with breasts.

644
02:03:14,440 --> 02:03:40,440
Yeah.

645
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:54,440
Okay.

646
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:56,440
I'm doing alright.

647
02:03:56,440 --> 02:04:10,440
Let's do it.

648
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:30,440
No.

649
02:04:40,440 --> 02:05:08,440
Okay.

650
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:18,440
Okay.

651
02:05:38,440 --> 02:06:06,440
Okay.

652
02:06:06,440 --> 02:06:14,440
Okay.

653
02:06:14,440 --> 02:06:40,440
This is amazing hearing you telling me he didn't hear that.

654
02:06:40,440 --> 02:07:02,440
I had to climb up there.

655
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:22,440
I have to go all the way up here.

656
02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:52,440
Okay, so how do I go back up?

657
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:56,440
How do I go back up?

658
02:07:56,440 --> 02:08:00,440
How do I go up there?

659
02:08:00,440 --> 02:08:04,440
Did I trap myself?

660
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:08,440
Was I supposed to have put the thingy in there?

661
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:24,440
Am I trapped?

662
02:08:24,440 --> 02:08:44,440
I have to go.

663
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:48,440
I passed it a few times.

664
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:58,440
Yeah.

665
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:10,440
Over here.

666
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:20,440
Yeah.

667
02:09:20,440 --> 02:09:30,440
Yeah.

668
02:09:30,440 --> 02:09:46,440
Alright.

669
02:09:46,440 --> 02:10:14,440
Okay.

670
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:42,440
Can you like leave?

671
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:54,440
Can you leave?

672
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:56,440
Why are you breathing so hard?

673
02:10:56,440 --> 02:10:58,440
Why is he breathing so hard?

674
02:10:58,440 --> 02:11:00,440
Why is he still in here?

675
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:04,440
Use monkeys?

676
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:20,440
What if he turns around really fast?

677
02:11:20,440 --> 02:11:40,440
Okay.

678
02:11:40,440 --> 02:12:02,440
Hang on one second.

679
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:20,440
Okay.

680
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:30,440
Okay.

681
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:40,440
Okay.

682
02:12:40,440 --> 02:12:50,440
Okay.

683
02:12:50,440 --> 02:13:00,440
Okay.

684
02:13:00,440 --> 02:13:10,440
Okay.

685
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:20,440
Okay.

686
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:40,440
Okay.

687
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:56,440
Thank you, food came. I have food now.

688
02:13:56,440 --> 02:14:08,440
Usually they like call you to let you know they're there, but they didn't call me this morning.

689
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:26,440
They're their phone.

690
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:44,440
I have beef, beef, beef broccoli, and white rice.

691
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:54,440
I haven't had beef in a while.

692
02:14:54,440 --> 02:15:04,440
Okay.

693
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:14,440
Okay.

694
02:15:14,440 --> 02:15:26,440
I'm so sorry if that hurt anyone's ears.

695
02:15:26,440 --> 02:15:34,440
I hit my hand on the microphone really, really hard.

696
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:44,440
Hang on.

697
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:24,440
Okay.

698
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:44,440
Okay.

699
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:54,440
Okay.

700
02:16:54,440 --> 02:17:18,440
Okay.

701
02:17:18,440 --> 02:17:46,440
Okay.

702
02:17:46,440 --> 02:17:56,440
Okay.

703
02:17:56,440 --> 02:18:06,440
Okay.

704
02:18:06,440 --> 02:18:26,440
Okay.

705
02:18:26,440 --> 02:18:36,440
Okay.

706
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:46,440
Okay.

707
02:18:46,440 --> 02:18:56,440
Okay.

708
02:18:56,440 --> 02:19:06,440
Okay.

709
02:19:06,440 --> 02:19:16,440
Okay.

710
02:19:16,440 --> 02:19:44,440
Okay.

711
02:19:44,440 --> 02:20:00,440
Okay.

712
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:12,440
I mean, like, it's so weird. There's sauce on the broccoli, but I don't taste the sauce. You know what I mean? There's sauce on the broccoli.

713
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:32,440
Am I weird?

714
02:20:32,440 --> 02:20:42,440
Okay.

715
02:20:42,440 --> 02:20:54,440
Maybe there's like a few pieces of broccoli in here that just don't taste good.

716
02:20:54,440 --> 02:21:14,440
It's like a mix.

717
02:21:14,440 --> 02:21:34,440
Maybe you're getting sick and losing your sense of taste.

718
02:21:34,440 --> 02:21:50,440
I thought I hope not. If I get sick, I get sick for a really long time. I would have to take a few days off if I get really sick. If I get sick to the point I lose sense of taste.

719
02:21:50,440 --> 02:22:06,440
I would have to take a few days off once like symptoms start hitting me. My immune system takes a long time to fight stuff off.

720
02:22:06,440 --> 02:22:32,440
My immune system takes a long time. So I'd be sick in bed for a really long time. Sleeping. Long stop sleeping. Got a rest.

721
02:22:32,440 --> 02:22:44,440
The sauce. The sauce tastes funny. It's like they changed the sauce. Like it tastes different.

722
02:22:44,440 --> 02:23:04,440
I like celery too, but imagine eating something and tasting something entirely different. Just because you like that taste of the food that you usually eat doesn't mean you want to taste it in the food that you're eating right now.

723
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:32,440
What you've been is the sauce? I don't even know. Does anyone ever question or know what's in their food when they order it?

724
02:23:32,440 --> 02:23:54,440
Really? So you go to a Chinese spot and you go what's in the sauce? What's in the sauce?

725
02:23:54,440 --> 02:24:04,440
What is in there?

726
02:24:04,440 --> 02:24:20,440
You think they'll really tell you?

727
02:24:20,440 --> 02:24:30,440
A secret formula?

728
02:24:50,440 --> 02:25:12,440
I want the secret formula.

729
02:25:12,440 --> 02:25:31,440
A secret formula.

730
02:25:31,440 --> 02:26:00,440
I think I know what it is. It's the combination of the rice and the sauce. Every time I put the rice and the sauce together and I eat it, the taste is very hard to describe.

731
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:18,440
It doesn't taste great when you combine the rice and the sauce. Usually that's never the case. I'm confused why it's so bad right now.

732
02:26:18,440 --> 02:26:40,440
But the sauce with the meat and the broccoli is kind of okay, but when you combine the rice, it tastes kind of funny.

733
02:26:40,440 --> 02:26:48,440
It tastes a little funny.

734
02:26:48,440 --> 02:27:16,440
Yes, white rice, beef and broccoli.

735
02:27:16,440 --> 02:27:29,440
Yeah, it's a soda. I only drink the ginger ale. Nope. Ginger ale.

736
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:51,440
Do you guys open your can halfway, not all the way? And then suck on it? I do that. I barely open it. I'm in my suck on it.

737
02:27:51,440 --> 02:28:02,440
I do it all the time. It's fun.

738
02:28:02,440 --> 02:28:27,440
But if you do that, remember to clean your can, clean the top of your can before you do that. If anyone ever gets curious to do it, wipe the top of your can.

739
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:42,440
No, I don't like this. Sorry, excuse me. I really don't like this.

740
02:28:57,440 --> 02:29:18,440
That's a dub. No, thank you.

741
02:29:18,440 --> 02:29:28,440
That almost made me barf.

742
02:29:28,440 --> 02:29:42,440
Whatever sauce this is, the sauce ruined everything.

743
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:58,440
I have a very sensitive stomach and taste buds. So I trust my gut.

744
02:29:58,440 --> 02:30:09,440
If my tongue tells me that this isn't good, I shouldn't eat it.

745
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:19,440
Even my mom, my mom and my sister and all my other siblings trust my taste buds. They used to question it.

746
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:25,440
They used to be like, oh, there's no way that every time you eat something in your tongue says it tastes bad that we shouldn't eat it.

747
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:36,440
I'm like, go ahead, eat it. Then they either get food poisoning or they like throw it up or they get really sick.

748
02:30:36,440 --> 02:30:46,440
So whatever. I trust my tongue. I'm not eating that.

749
02:30:46,440 --> 02:30:56,440
My body, I tried to swallow it and then my body literally made it come back up. Nope. I'm good. I'm not going to eat it.

750
02:31:17,440 --> 02:31:44,440
Some of it that I already swallowed, my stomach is starting to hurt a little bit.

751
02:31:44,440 --> 02:32:03,440
Alright, it's fine. It was a burp. We're okay. We're okay. It was a burp. I'm just a tiny bit nauseous. That's all.

752
02:32:14,440 --> 02:32:34,440
I can eat this. I can't eat that. This is fine. But every time I eat that, it's not fine. What is that?

753
02:32:34,440 --> 02:32:47,440
Yeah, the rice. The rice is just not, it's not hitting me very well. I don't want to eat that. The other stuff is fine.

754
02:32:47,440 --> 02:33:11,440
But the rice was wrong with the rice. No, it's not overcooked, I don't think.

755
02:33:11,440 --> 02:33:31,440
Probably old rice, maybe. Every time I try to eat the rice, I get really nauseous. It tastes strange. Really strange. I don't like it. I don't like it.

756
02:33:31,440 --> 02:33:52,440
It's time for pancakes. I can't have sugar any more today. I already had pancakes earlier. Too much sugar. It's fine if I can eat some of it. It's fine as long as I eat something, right?

757
02:33:52,440 --> 02:34:11,440
It should be okay. Yeah.

758
02:34:11,440 --> 02:34:38,440
It wasn't burnt. It wasn't burnt. It wasn't a burnt pancake, okay? It was not burnt. It was nice pancake-y, okay? I made the pancake-y and it was good. My camera on my phone makes everything much darker. I don't know why. I can't fix it.

759
02:34:38,440 --> 02:35:05,440
The pancake was literally golden with brown edges. It was golden with brown edges. It was golden and had brown edges, but the camera made the edges look black. It's not my fault.

760
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:32,440
It wasn't slimy. It was perfect. You know when you take a bite out of the edge and it goes crunch and then soft? Like the tiny, tiny little piece of the edge is crunch, crunch, crunch. And it's yummy.

761
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:56,440
Just a little toasting. Well, it was fried. It was fried. I did use quite a bit of butter. And someone said that there was garlic on top of it. Why the heck would I put garlic on top of a pancake? It was melted butter. Melted butter.

762
02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:22,440
You will feel how there is melted butter.

763
02:36:32,440 --> 02:36:52,440
It's like how my grandpa used to make pancakes. Really? It was good. It's a lot of butter. Butter makes the edges really crispy.

764
02:36:53,440 --> 02:37:06,440
Edges of pancakes really crispy. It was super nice. It was super soft and really white on the inside. Like puffy, like puffy white.

765
02:37:07,440 --> 02:37:24,440
That was a good pancake, I mean. It was just one giant pancake. Someone asked if I dusted in syrup. I didn't. The syrup just like slid off the top all around the side. So it looked like it was like sitting in syrup.

766
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:32,440
But trust it wasn't. It was just a tiny bit of syrup because I can't have too much sugar.

767
02:37:54,440 --> 02:38:14,440
The more you tease, the higher the chances of me eating you instead of my pancakes. The choice is yours. Promise.

768
02:38:24,440 --> 02:38:37,440
You'd be an honor. My body is ready.

769
02:38:55,440 --> 02:39:15,440
Imagine. I could see it. I want to get some art done. I don't want to draw it. I want to see a professional draw it. I want to do it. I want to get a professional draw certain things.

770
02:39:15,440 --> 02:39:30,440
I just need to see where, you know, where.

771
02:39:31,440 --> 02:39:37,440
Oh.

772
02:39:37,440 --> 02:39:41,440
Ha ha ha.

773
02:39:41,440 --> 02:39:56,440
I'm excited a little bit of this, but I am nauseous and I have a high sneaking suspicion that this is going to come right back up in like a few minutes.

774
02:39:56,440 --> 02:40:21,440
With the off chance that it doesn't, I eat it.

775
02:40:21,440 --> 02:40:23,440
Ew.

776
02:40:51,440 --> 02:41:12,440
I think this is going to make me sick. Continues eating it.

777
02:41:12,440 --> 02:41:28,440
Ew.

778
02:41:28,440 --> 02:41:32,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

779
02:41:32,440 --> 02:41:51,440
I'm hungry. It's better to eat it and then barf it up and let your body do the talking or eat it and chances you keep it down and then you're full. Bam, you have food in there and then the digest and you're fine.

780
02:41:51,440 --> 02:42:14,440
I have nutrition. You have food in there. You don't waste it. No waste food. You don't waste it. You eat some of it.

781
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:43,440
If your body is really hungry and starving it will ignore some of the some of the bad stuff.

782
02:42:43,440 --> 02:42:58,440
If it's hungry enough, don't eat it. It will take it. Take what it can get.

783
02:42:58,440 --> 02:43:06,440
Yeah, it'll be fine. It's fine.

784
02:43:07,440 --> 02:43:33,440
Not to stop drinking this boil milk. Only if you're absolutely starving. But I don't recommend drinking spoiled milk or dairy.

785
02:43:33,440 --> 02:43:39,440
I've been drinking spoiled milk before.

786
02:43:39,440 --> 02:43:46,440
Those were the days.

787
02:43:46,440 --> 02:44:05,440
It was like absolutely nothing. Nothing in the fridge. I remember I hadn't eaten for days. I was so hungry. I was so hungry and my mom was out working so she was like never home and it was just me and my sibling, my younger sibling.

788
02:44:05,440 --> 02:44:25,440
And I was like, oh, yeah, I am so hungry. I took the cereal. It was like really stale cereal. I had born me a bowl and the milk was like kind of like chunky.

789
02:44:25,440 --> 02:44:41,440
And I sat on the floor, crouched on the floor with my sibling in front of me and we stared at the bowl and I was like, I'll eat it first if it kills me. Don't eat it.

790
02:44:55,440 --> 02:45:19,440
I couldn't let my younger sibling eat it and then what if they like perish and then I didn't want to meet my mom's wrath of letting my younger sibling eat the spoiled food.

791
02:45:25,440 --> 02:45:41,440
So I ate it. I ate a little bit of it and it made me so sick. I was so sick. Yeah, I saw it was spoiled. I was hungry. Excuse me.

792
02:45:41,440 --> 02:46:09,440
I was starving. Yeah, me and my sibling was starving. We were hungry. We were very hungry. I felt like something stuck in my throat. Oh my god.

793
02:46:11,440 --> 02:46:18,440
I hear a fine.

794
02:46:18,440 --> 02:46:28,440
A yogurt with spoiled milk. That sounds gross.

795
02:46:49,440 --> 02:47:08,440
I mean, I know yogurt is made out of that kind of like made out of that but don't you need like a special process to make it like like doesn't it take like a long time to make yogurt.

796
02:47:08,440 --> 02:47:26,440
It doesn't like all the bad stuff kind of need to be like filtered out of it. Did your mom do all of that? It's not that hard. I guess so people make their own cheese with spoiled milk so I'm not surprised.

797
02:47:26,440 --> 02:47:35,440
It still sounds gross.

798
02:47:35,440 --> 02:47:57,440
My long distance family member makes their own cheese with spoiled milk. They make a mozzarella cheese for their pizza.

799
02:47:57,440 --> 02:48:13,440
Well, I guess it's not spoiled milk. I guess it's normal milk before it spoils and they just warm it up and then make cheese with the milk. I don't think it's really spoiled though.

800
02:48:13,440 --> 02:48:36,440
Mozzarella cheese with mozzarella cheese. Yeah, soon to be spoiled. I mean homemade cheese is how you make cheese instead of having to go all the way out to go buy cheese you can make just make your own cheese.

801
02:48:36,440 --> 02:48:53,440
I remember making ice cream in school but you don't use spoiled milk to make ice cream. No more, no more, no more normal milk.

802
02:48:53,440 --> 02:49:04,440
I have another minute after that story.

803
02:49:04,440 --> 02:49:16,440
I mean you could but why? It would murder you. You know.

804
02:49:16,440 --> 02:49:33,440
You know sherbet ice cream? You know I can't eat that. I can't have sherbet ice cream.

805
02:49:33,440 --> 02:49:52,440
I will absolutely destroy my stomach beyond what anything else I can eat. I don't know. I think it's the sugar because sherbet ice cream does have a ton of sugar.

806
02:49:52,440 --> 02:50:15,440
I think it's the sugar but I cannot have sherbet. I used to eat so much of it. I think I like gained that thing. I used to eat so much sherbet ice cream in the past when I was younger. I used to eat so much of it.

807
02:50:15,440 --> 02:50:36,440
And then after a little while like years later all of a sudden every time I ate it I was in excruciating pain. I was in so much pain. It was so bad.

808
02:50:36,440 --> 02:50:49,440
And then I would test it. I would I bought another one again. Like not recently but like a few years ago I bought one and I was like I'm gonna test it and only eat a tiny bit. Just two spoonfuls.

809
02:50:49,440 --> 02:51:00,440
My stomach. That was it. I couldn't eat it. It's impossible. It's absolutely impossible.

810
02:51:00,440 --> 02:51:12,440
Well because my doctor said the only way to find out if I have an actual intolerance the stuff is to eat them. So I was testing it by eating it.

811
02:51:12,440 --> 02:51:23,440
My doctor was like well the only way to know is to eat it. And I was like okay. And I ate it. And then I was like.

812
02:51:23,440 --> 02:51:47,440
Yeah I actually have the mess around to find out.

813
02:51:48,440 --> 02:52:00,440
That was years ago when I had the huge humongous stomach aches. Then I stopped eating it for a couple of years. And then my doctor was like and then I got a new doctor and my doctor was like what can you not eat.

814
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:13,440
And I said sherbet ice cream. It makes my stomach hurt. And I was like are you sure. And I was like well like what if it doesn't hurt now. And I was like I don't know.

815
02:52:13,440 --> 02:52:23,440
I haven't eaten it since then because it made my stomach hurt. And I was like well the only way you can know is to eat it. And I was like okay.

816
02:52:23,440 --> 02:52:37,440
I guess I'll taste it again. And yes. And I ate it again. I had to do the same thing with cheese and everything else. They made me eat it again.

817
02:52:37,440 --> 02:52:58,440
And I went back in and they were like so what can you not eat. And I was like oh yeah for sure sherbet ice cream can't eat that.

818
02:52:58,440 --> 02:53:12,440
Was that loud. I was drinking soda. Was that loud. I really thought I turned that off. I guess I didn't. I think I forgot to turn it off.

819
02:53:29,440 --> 02:53:35,440
No.

820
02:53:35,440 --> 02:53:45,440
No.

821
02:53:45,440 --> 02:53:51,440
Help me. Help me.

822
02:53:51,440 --> 02:53:59,440
Help me.

823
02:53:59,440 --> 02:54:03,440
Help me.

824
02:54:21,440 --> 02:54:35,440
Was it realistic that you thought it was real.

825
02:54:36,440 --> 02:54:43,440
I can't do this anymore.

826
02:54:43,440 --> 02:54:48,440
Help me.

827
02:54:48,440 --> 02:54:50,440
I can't take it.

828
02:54:50,440 --> 02:54:54,440
Help me.

829
02:54:54,440 --> 02:55:09,560
oh shit I drilled oh man

830
02:55:24,440 --> 02:55:50,880
yeah yeah yeah would you think you're acting like a zombie

831
02:55:50,880 --> 02:56:20,760
I'm a zombie

832
02:56:20,760 --> 02:56:28,520
I love you zombie

833
02:56:50,760 --> 02:57:15,720
I don't know why I think that you like that I at first I thought the YouTube emotes were

834
02:57:15,720 --> 02:57:20,720
a little silly looking but they're growing on me I don't know why they're really growing

835
02:57:20,720 --> 02:57:48,720
on me. I think I really like some of these YouTube emotes. I think they're great.

836
02:57:50,720 --> 02:58:18,680
So we stop procrastinating. I don't like that one. I don't I don't like that one. No that one I

837
02:58:18,680 --> 02:58:47,680
don't like it. So what about this one? No, I don't like that one. I don't like it.

838
02:58:47,680 --> 02:58:54,680
The game scared you so far. What do you think? What do you think?

839
02:59:17,680 --> 02:59:46,680
I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it.

840
02:59:46,680 --> 03:00:15,680
I didn't mean to do that. I pressed the wrong button. I pressed the wrong button. I pressed the wrong button.

841
03:00:15,680 --> 03:00:44,680
I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it.

842
03:00:44,680 --> 03:00:59,680
I don't like it. I don't like it.

843
03:00:59,680 --> 03:01:23,680
I don't like it. I don't like it.

844
03:01:23,680 --> 03:01:52,680
I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it.

845
03:01:52,680 --> 03:02:21,680
I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it.

846
03:02:22,680 --> 03:02:51,680
I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it.

847
03:02:51,680 --> 03:03:12,680
I can't see. This is on my way. I have to move it. You gotta go up there. On my way. I'm scared.

848
03:03:12,680 --> 03:03:41,680
I'm scared.

849
03:03:41,680 --> 03:03:52,680
What's wrong?

850
03:03:52,680 --> 03:04:09,680
No. No, no, no.

851
03:04:09,680 --> 03:04:19,680
No, no, no, no.

852
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:48,680
What are you supposed to do there?

853
03:04:48,680 --> 03:04:54,680
Hide?

854
03:05:18,680 --> 03:05:45,680
What? What am I supposed to do? Just run? I don't know. I don't know what am I supposed to do? I kept running last time. He still got me.

855
03:05:45,680 --> 03:06:14,680
I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it.

856
03:06:14,680 --> 03:06:43,680
I don't like it. I don't like it.

857
03:06:44,680 --> 03:07:09,680
Sonic X.

858
03:07:09,680 --> 03:07:38,680
What the heck am I supposed to do up here?

859
03:07:39,680 --> 03:08:08,680
What the heck am I supposed to do?

860
03:08:08,680 --> 03:08:37,680
What the heck am I supposed to do here?

861
03:08:37,680 --> 03:09:06,680
What the heck am I supposed to do?

862
03:09:06,680 --> 03:09:30,680
Why?

863
03:09:30,680 --> 03:09:59,680
Why?

864
03:09:59,680 --> 03:10:05,680
I don't know what I'm supposed to do here.

865
03:10:05,680 --> 03:10:29,680
Oh. Oh!

866
03:10:29,680 --> 03:10:55,680
I just have this line.

867
03:10:55,680 --> 03:11:20,680
Stop tripping.

868
03:11:20,680 --> 03:11:49,680
What the heck am I supposed to do here?

869
03:11:50,680 --> 03:12:17,680

What the heck am I supposed to do here?

940
03:43:05,680 --> 03:43:09,680
I can try and do tingles but I'm not too sure.

941
03:43:09,680 --> 03:43:16,680
I'm not at all like super like extreme knowledgeable of all the like every single trigger.

942
03:43:16,680 --> 03:43:23,680
So I've been looking up some stuff but I don't have the I don't have a lot of stuff to do this.

943
03:43:23,680 --> 03:43:29,680
The triggers but eventually I will get them and then I can do all the stuff.

944
03:43:29,680 --> 03:43:40,680
I have more triggers for you guys and I was more than just happy to use my voice and my praises and stuff.

945
03:43:40,680 --> 03:43:45,680
But since I can't really do all the extra sounds and stuff I got to be careful.

946
03:43:45,680 --> 03:43:50,680
So I need a little extra more other other stuff.

947
03:43:50,680 --> 03:43:51,680
I can still do praises.

948
03:43:51,680 --> 03:43:53,680
I can still do requests.

949
03:43:53,680 --> 03:43:55,680
I can still say stuff.

950
03:43:55,680 --> 03:44:01,680
But I have to be careful with noises.

951
03:44:01,680 --> 03:44:08,680
Scalp scratches.

952
03:44:08,680 --> 03:44:28,680
Scalp scratches.

953
03:44:28,680 --> 03:44:55,680

954
03:44:55,680 --> 03:45:02,680

955
03:45:02,680 --> 03:45:21,680
Scalp scratches.

956
03:45:21,680 --> 03:45:29,680
Scalp scratches.

957
03:45:29,680 --> 03:45:32,680
You have to also be careful with the breathing as well.

958
03:45:32,680 --> 03:45:37,680
I hate that too.

959
03:45:37,680 --> 03:45:40,680

1022
03:50:52,420 --> 03:50:57,140
Like I woke after I went to sleep. I was asleep for like three hours. I knocked out and I was like

1023
03:50:57,220 --> 03:51:05,700
and then I like woke up and then I went and then I fell back asleep like hours later. I ate

1024
03:51:05,700 --> 03:51:14,900
like food. I made pancake. After the pancake, I took a nap. After the pancake, I went to sleep

03:53:50,860 --> 03:53:53,980
We should make a plushie with all of us with this face.

1048
03:54:13,860 --> 03:54:19,300
The pancake was really good.

1049
03:54:19,300 --> 03:54:20,660
It was amazing.

1050
03:54:28,140 --> 03:54:30,340
Hey, that's mean.

1051
03:54:30,340 --> 03:54:31,660
Why do you say that?

1052
03:54:31,660 --> 03:54:33,820
That's mean.

1053
03:54:33,820 --> 03:54:36,660
I don't need classes to make pancake.

1054
03:54:36,660 --> 03:54:42,660
My pancake was good.

1055
03:54:45,660 --> 03:54:47,660
It was a good pancake.

1056
03:55:03,660 --> 03:55:05,660
Stop bullying me for my pancakes, OK?

1057
03:55:05,660 --> 03:55:08,660
Stop bullying me.

1058
03:55:08,660 --> 03:55:11,660
My pancake was good.

1059
03:55:11,660 --> 03:55:14,660
One day, I want to make you eat it.

1060
03:55:14,660 --> 03:55:18,660
And you're going to like my pancake.

1061
03:55:18,660 --> 03:55:20,660
You hear me?

1062
03:55:20,660 --> 03:55:22,660
You're going to like it.

03:55:22,660 --> 03:55:24,660
You're going to like it.

03:55:24,660 --> 03:55:26,660
You're going to enjoy it.

1065
03:55:36,660 --> 03:55:39,660
Oh, I'm going to make you eat it.

1066
03:55:52,660 --> 03:55:54,660
I'm cakey.

1067

Work feed.

1068
03:56:05,660 --> 03:56:11,660
Or you're going to have another taste of my other cake.

1069
03:56:35,660 --> 03:56:37,660
I'm going to make you eat it.

1070
03:56:50,660 --> 03:56:54,660
It's a big stretch.

1071
03:56:54,660 --> 03:56:56,660
And fireman's a hit.

1072
03:56:56,660 --> 03:57:00,660
Oh, it's only 12.

1073
03:57:00,660 --> 03:57:02,660
Not that late.

1074
03:57:02,660 --> 03:57:04,660
I thought it was like super late.

1075
03:57:04,660 --> 03:57:06,660
Who's live right now?

1076
03:57:06,660 --> 03:57:09,660

You lied to her.

1091
03:58:37,660 --> 03:58:40,660
She is not lying.
