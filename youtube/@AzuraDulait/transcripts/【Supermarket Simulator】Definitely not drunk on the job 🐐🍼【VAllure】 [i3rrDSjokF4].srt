00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,060
Let me

180
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,520
let me

181
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,340
Let me

182
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,620
Let me

183
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,620
let me

184
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,560
let me

185
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,000
Let me

186
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,860
let me

187
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,020
let me

188
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,560
now

189
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,500
Now

190
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,460
now

191
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,500
now

192
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:35,660
I've had some vegan food. Vegan food isn't too bad. There was like these like meatballs

193
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:41,660
that weren't really meat and I don't know what it was made out of and I ate it and it

194
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:57,580
was so good. I don't remember. It was like whole foods I think. It was very yummy. It

195
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:05,660
was super yummy. I didn't even know it was vegan. I just picked it up and I ate it.

196
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:23,100
That was crazy.

197
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,100
hmm

198
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:40,540
Adora is via lawyers most intellectuals from that's right

199
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:48,520
That's right. I'm the most intellectuals we're here. I know everything is to know about anything

200
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,580
I'm intelligent. Mm-hmm

201
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,340
hmm

202
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,260
Mm

203
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,740
There's no nine of our line and we need a record with the jukebox. I'm here with you, Lele

204
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:28,080
I was a little bit late to stream though.

205
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,020
I had to pee pee.

206
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:40,540
If I came all of a sudden I had to go.

207
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:45,260
Um, actually.

208
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:55,780
Could have been artificial meat maybe, but it was the lesses.

209
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,420
I don't care what it was.

210
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,620
Give me more of that and just don't tell me what it was because if you tell me it was

211
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:19,980
something crazy I'll probably be sick to my stomach.

212
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:39,420
Still better than Taco Bell meat?

213
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,980
You know, I had Taco Bell for the first time in like 5 years.

214
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,540
It was actually pretty good.

215
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:53,900
I had Taco Bell so long because I used to really fuck my stomach.

216
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,420
Really bad.

217
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:02,620
I destroyed my stomach, but I had it recently.

218
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,460
It was good.

219
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,020
It was really good, but I couldn't finish that quesadilla.

220
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:14,300
It was uh, too much.

221
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,980
Too much.

222
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:21,100
Too much my stomach, not until it.

223
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,060
I'm a big fan of soft tacos though.

224
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,060
I like a soft taco.

225
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:32,060
I'm traumatized by a hard taco because I remember biting into one and then like the shell like

226
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,300
shanked my gum.

227
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:46,700
I remember being in so much pain and I was like nah, I'm not eating a hard taco again.

228
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,420
It's horrible.

229
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:57,260
I have a bad experience.

230
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,900
It's true, I think so.

231
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,780
I believe so.

232
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:20,860
Oh my gosh, that reminds me of when I got food poisoning from Mickey D.

233
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,620
I had heavy food poisoning, twice.

234
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:46,300
I haven't eaten anything really, but this like chicken.

235
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,380
Hey, just like two pieces of chicken.

236
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,940
That was all I had today, nothing else.

237
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,660
And there's icy.

238
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,260
No.

239
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,660
No bread.

240
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,700
I'm all out of bread.

241
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,860
I'm all out of bread.

242
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,860
Only bread I have is this one right here.

243
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,540
I want.

244
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,580
One double.

245
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,900
Oh, can't reach it.

246
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,580
That's too far.

247
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,460
Yeah, twice.

248
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,380
I got food poisoning at Mickey D.

249
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:49,660
I ate 20 pieces of chicken nuggets, chicken nuggets.

250
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,500
I ate 20 pieces and the other time I had a 40 piece.

251
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,340
And then I got sick.

252
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:09,980
I went to bed and I was laying on the floor because I couldn't lay on the sofa at the time

253
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,260
because I didn't have the actual bed.

254
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,060
I had a sofa.

255
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:22,300
A family member was staying over so they took my sofa and they kept kicking me so I laid on the

256
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:22,940
floor.

257
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:30,140
I was on the floor and I was sleeping and then all of a sudden my stomach was hurting.

258
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,300
It woke me up, but I couldn't move.

259
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,740
I was like paralyzed.

260
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,380
I couldn't move.

261
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,420
I couldn't get up.

262
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,140
I was laying there.

263
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:50,140
I was on my stomach and I woke up and I was like my head up and I was like,

264
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,300
whoa, I can't, I can't move.

265
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,580
I gotta go to the bathroom.

266
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,420
I can't, I can't move.

267
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,580
And I was like, and I almost like choked.

268
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,660
I had to turn over to the side, like as hard as I could.

269
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,460
I had to force myself to turn to the side and I was just like,

270
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,660
it wouldn't stop.

271
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,540
It was horrible.

272
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:34,460
And then after that, I didn't have Mickey D's for like three years and then I had it again later on.

273
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,940
Everyone was eating it.

274
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,380
It was the only thing I could afford at the time.

275
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:48,540
They're not when they still have the dollar menus.

276
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,900
Yeah, no other choice.

277
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,460
I was a hungry.

278
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,660
I was a hungry.

279
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,540
Mmm.

280
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,740
Sweet and sour sauce is good.

281
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,300
I like the sauce for chimkin nuggets.

282
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:40,540
I had sweet and sour sauce with my nuggets.

283
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,380
Mmm.

284
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,820
I'm going to have one more drink.

285
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,740
Totally not alki-hole, nothing like that.

286
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,380
Oh, nope, nope, nope.

287
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,380
And then we'll play and we'll head on over to work.

288
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,820

01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:22,580

545
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:24,580

546
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,580

01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:29,540
Two bridge hi Trevor how you doing?

567
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,420
He's still not close yet

568
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,420
Oh

569
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,300
My eyeballs

570
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:13,100
You know my favorite part of a sigh, you know you know when you know long stockings

571
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:17,620
You know when they're like really tight and they got that little plump

572
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:20,540
Little plump to it

573
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:26,580
Just I just want to

574
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,100
Yeah

575
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:11,220
Isn't there this artist that makes food out of like makes clothes out of food

576
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:16,340
Like candy and then the like models wear it

577
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:23,060
I'd eat that I eat that I

578
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,500
Eat that they don't have to take it off

579
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,500
I eat it right off

580
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:46,500
We didn't make 200 bug barons we're broke. How do you close again? Oh

581
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:54,620
Start next day start next day

582
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,500
But

583
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:18,060
I have no clue why that popped into my head, but about into my head

584
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,580
What did I pop into my head?

585
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:31,740
The period about the taxes

586
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,140
He taxes

587
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:52,740
Taxi

588
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,740
Who doesn't like taxes?

589
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:56,740
Who doesn't like taxes?

590
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:58,740
Two taxes, stupid.

591
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:00,740
Stupid taxes.

592
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:02,740
I hate taxes.

593
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:12,740
You're welcome, Forgotten Memories.

594
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:14,740
You're gonna experience that a lot here.

595
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:16,740
Two breads.

596
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,740
Sure.

597
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:20,740
I'll see you.

598
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:24,740
Hey, you tall guy.

599
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:26,740
You back again.

600
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:28,740
How you doing?

601
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:30,740
Have a nice day.

602
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,740
So a big boy.

603
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:34,740
A big boy.

604
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,740
Big boy.

605
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:38,740
Massive boy.

606
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:44,740
But no matter how big you are,

607
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:46,740
you'll always be a big boy.

608
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:50,740
But no matter how big you are,

609
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:54,740
you'll always be small to me.

610
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:04,740
Wow.

611
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:06,740
You have nice hair.

612
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:08,740
It's kind of like doing a little

613
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:10,740
light show for me.

614
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:12,740
Kind of.

615
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:22,740
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t.

616
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,740
I'm sorry.

617
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:28,740
My apologies.

618
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,740
Ooh, a whole white suit.

619
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:36,740
Brass fancy.

620
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:38,740
Fancy.

621
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,740
Oh.

622
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:50,740
Fancy two breads.

623
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:52,740
I like them when they get two breads.

624
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,740
You know, you can't...

625
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:56,740
You gotta make sure you pay attention

626
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,740
to the other one, you know?

627
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,740
So it's always two.

628
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:02,740
Bye-bye.

629
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:04,740
Hi, girl. How you doing?

630
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,740
Got a little weird...

631
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,740
Is that a bed head?

632
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:10,740
A little thing going on over there.

633
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:12,740
Right there.

634
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:14,740
Come.

635
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:16,740
I guess it's kind of cute.

636
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:18,740
It's kind of cute like you.

637
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:20,740
Kind of endearing.

638
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:22,740
Kind of cute.

639
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:26,740
Bye-bye.

640
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:28,740
Dang, that skirt snatched.

641
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:34,740
Life seems rough.

642
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,740
I hope it gets better.

643
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,740
I'm gonna say...

644
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,740
Ooh.

645
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:42,740
Thank you.

646
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:44,740
Thank you.

647
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,740
I'm gonna say...

648
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,740
How you doing?

649
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,740
Feel like a bartender?

650
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,740
Like in your bar or something?

651
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,740
Can I get milk now?

652
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,740
I want milk.

653
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,740
How do I get it?

654
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:02,740
How do I get milk?

655
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,740
I...

656
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,740
Management.

657
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,740
Licenses.

658
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:10,740
Purchase.

659
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:12,740
Milk, milk, milk, milk.

660
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:14,740
What the heck?

661
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:16,740
I just have a marker.

662
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:18,740
Milk, milk, milk.

663
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:20,740
Milk, milk, milk.

664
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,740
Milk.

665
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:24,740
Bar.

666
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,740
Wait, do I need a fridge?

667
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:28,740
How much is a fridge?

668
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,740
Oh boy.

669
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,740
Okay.

670
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:36,740
We got this.

671
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,740
Yeah, yeah.

672
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:40,740
Gotta make that buck runny.

673
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,740
Gotta make that buck runny.

674
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,740
When you gave me a hundred dollars.

675
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,740
Five, five, two...

676
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,740
Alright, Walter.

677
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:52,740
My apologies.

678
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:54,740
My apologies.

679
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:56,740
Let's pretend...

680
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:58,740
I said nothing.

681
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,740
Go ahead and take that.

682
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,740
And...

683
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,740
Complete a 50...

684
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:06,740
Ouch!

685
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,740
Have a nice day, Walter.

686
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:10,740
My bad, my bad.

687
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,740
Probably needs that.

688
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,740
Buck runies, you know.

689
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:20,740
Probably only got 100 buck runies.

690
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:26,740
Thanks for shopping.

691
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,740
Bye-bye.

01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:56,500
off slowly you could do it on the table right now and see how it is when you slide it grab it

721
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:02,900
and then you slide it so my thumb was hanging off of this of the safe and they closed it right on my

722
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:15,860
finger thank goodness she didn't um the uh they didn't close it all the way on my finger like it

723
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:23,300
didn't completely close or it probably would have been worse but they managed to open it back up

724
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:34,580
really quickly uh before it closed fully but my finger was shamushed it was split in two

725
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:37,620
hey the big two

726
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:43,460
hey and next day it was split in two

727
01:14:56,820 --> 01:15:03,540
working there was a nightmare it was a nightmare do you have a scar I have a small one

728
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:09,460
it's tiny it's not very visible um they didn't even have like a first aid kit

729
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:16,980
and my boss was like just slap a bandaid on it and get back to work I was like oh okay

730
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:23,380
I was like I didn't scream or anything you know adrenaline rushed in and I was really I was the

731
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:32,020
calmest while everyone else was freaking out I was so calm super calm yeah

732
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:39,300
and then um I had to walk because they didn't want to call anyone to come get me so I had to walk to

733
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:48,260
the hospital on foot I had to walk I wish I knew I was really young so I wish I knew about you

734
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:54,820
know suing and stuff but two years already passed more than two years that's so long I don't like

735
01:15:55,060 --> 01:16:02,820
it way more than two years has passed so I think there's like a you can't really uh

736
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:10,580
so anyone after two two two years I think it's the thingy so I didn't know what I just moved on

737
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:16,980
past it and ever since then I just hated that place they did more and more things that really

738
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:24,660
made me upset so I had to walk to the hospital and they got like uh they put like skin glue

739
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:30,580
on me uh and they had to like shift the finger they have to shift it

740
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:39,060
for it to realign itself and then they stuck it together they smushed it together and then they

741
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:45,780
put skin glue on it to keep it together

742
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:46,900
so

743
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:52,900
yeah

744
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:02,820
and then they healed they healed after that had a big old band-aid and a big old band-aid it was

745
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:10,900
like a big wrap around it

746
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:16,900
and

747
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:24,100
yeah I think that's it wasn't worse it could be like what happened to a what do you say

748
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:31,620
I don't got nothing else for you get out yeah we don't sell sugar maybe

749
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:40,900
I got some sort of sugar for you

750
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,900
ah

751
01:17:56,820 --> 01:18:02,260
it could be worse it could have been worse with my finger because I think the person who got it

752
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:09,460
the worst was um a family member of mine we had a doggie

753
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:21,140
we had a doggie and doggie was tied to the door the front door and

754
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:35,620
and family member decided to open door with doggie still tied to door and doggie loves outdoor

755
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:41,460
loves outdoors you know loves out being outdoors and doggie slipped through the crack of the door

756
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:44,740
and pulled the door shut

757
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:49,540
and family member

758
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:54,740
lost finger

759
01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:00,260
finger was hanging on by skin

760
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:05,620
um so it could have been worse

761
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:18,500
I remember being traumatized by that I had it took me a long a long time to get over that scene

762

983
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:30,880
Excuse me.

984
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,880
I didn't hear that.

985
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:35,880
I think I got a, I think I got a, I think I just drank some water.

986
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:37,880
I think I just drank water.

987
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:38,880
Mmm.

988
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:43,880
I don't, I don't feel so good.

989
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:50,880
I don't feel so good.

990
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:59,880
I don't feel so good.

991
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:08,880
I don't feel so good.

992
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:18,880
Oh my gosh.

993
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:25,880
I hope that I found it.

994
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:32,880
I am feeling about, about to, I don't know.

995
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:37,880
It's a long line.

996
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:38,880
Oh boy.

997
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:41,880
We're fine.

998
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:43,880
I am okay.

999
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:48,880
I think I'm okay.

1000
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,880
I drank a whole bottle.

1001
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:57,880
An entire whole bottle of green grape soju.

1002
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:06,880
I had a whole bottle.

1003
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:32,880
The discovery of cheese was by accident and bit the first cheese to taste tested.

1004
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:37,880
I was probably consumed because it's like, well, that milk was the only thing I had for food.

1005
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:39,880
And then ate it for survival.

1006
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:40,880
True.

1007
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:44,880
I think that's probably what happened.

1008
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,880
You know the first sonic?

1009
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,880
You know the very first sonic?

1010
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:49,880
Not the very first sonic.

1011
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:50,880
You know the one.

1012
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:53,880
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

1013
01:47:53,880 --> 01:48:01,880
When you're underwater and you butt it down.

1014
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:03,880
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

1015
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:08,880
I remember what sonic with that was.

1016
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,880
That's the first one really?

1017
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:13,880
I want to play that.

1018
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:17,880
I want to play that.

1019
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:22,880
That was like the best ADHD game ever.

1020
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:44,640
I want to play that. It's not fair. Where is it? I can't find it anywhere. I don't think

1021
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:46,640
we can play Sonic on stream though, I don't think.

1022
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:16,080
Wasn't it?

1023
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:24,240
Why not? I don't think we can even find that game. I don't think. I don't think you can really find

1024
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:30,800
that. I don't think you're gonna be able to find that at all on PC. Give me.

1025
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:42,000
So sorry. I'm a little gassy. I'm so sorry. Oh, so unclassy. So unladylike.

1026
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,920
I'm a little gassy.

1027
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:45,920
No

1028
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:11,480
Oh

1029
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:19,640
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

1030
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:29,120
Sonic 2? I like the Sonic games a lot. I used to play them a lot when I was a

1031
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:34,920
kid. However, I wasn't allowed to play. I was second player. You know that kid

1032
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:43,940
that had the remote control that wasn't actually plugged in. I was second

1033
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:57,760
player. I wasn't allowed to play. But I was a pretty smart kid so I knew that I

1034
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:08,120
wasn't playing the game. So I figured it out really fast. I didn't complain though.

1035
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:13,320
Rest in peace. I'm God!

1036
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:30,800
I'm back.

1037
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:38,840
I'm back.

1038
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:17,160
Gas! See, I wasn't passing that kind of gas. I was just belching. I was just belching.

1039
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:22,920
What do you mean? I have a different sound. I was like lagging a little bit. Sorry, I'm

1040
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:38,080
catching up. I did a little bit of crashy. You know, I still have my Xbox 360. I've

1041
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:47,800
had it for years. I still have it and it works. I have a bunch of Xbox 360 games.

1042
01:52:48,240 --> 01:53:01,600
Let me see. Let me look up at my bookshelf. Left 4 Dead 2, Payday 2. Does that be

1043
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:12,880
jeweled? I said Arkham, Arkham, Arkham, Arkham Asylum Batman. I have Assassin's Creed

1044
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:18,840
Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed. What other Assassin's Creed? The first one?

1045
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:28,440
Assassin's Creed 2. I have Sims, pets. Oh no, it's PC. That's a PC disc. Why is that

1046
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:39,720
in the middle of there? I have BioShock, BioShock Infinite, Call of Duty Black Ops 2. I have

1047
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:52,360
another Assassin's Creed. I think I bought two because one disc wasn't working. Assassin's

1048
01:53:52,440 --> 01:54:05,760
Creed 4? Is that what that says? Grand Theft Auto? Grand Theft Auto? Yeah. Then I have another

1049
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:12,640
Call of Duty Black Ops 2 disc because the other one wasn't working. I have Destiny. I never really

1050
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:26,320
played it. Destiny. Final Fantasy X2. And then everything else is GameCube games. A bunch of

1051
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:34,600
GameCube games at PlayStation 2 games. I haven't been up there on that shelf in like four years.

1052
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:36,720
Everything's just been sitting up there.

1053
01:54:54,720 --> 01:55:00,320
Yeah, my Xbox still works. I took kind of good care of it. I haven't received the red thing,

1054
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:07,760
red ring of death yet. It's still good. Still working. My other one used to turn on by itself.

1055
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:15,000
Actually, I think this is the one. If it's not unplugged, it turns on by itself. I don't know

1056
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:25,600
why, but it turns on by itself. If you leave it plugged in, it will just turn on. I think that's

1057
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:34,000
the only thing wrong with it. All my other games are long gone.

1058
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:47,280
And then I have the Naruto Ultimate Ninja for PlayStation 2. I have all of them,

1059
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:52,400
except for one because someone stole it. I had Chronicles as well.

1060
01:55:56,560 --> 01:56:02,160
I don't have four because I came out after I got the whole pack series.

1061
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:14,480
Then I have Storm Chronicles as well. I have the first Sims and Sims 2.

1062
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:24,640
I have the Brats. I remember getting that for my birthday long time ago. The Brats.

1063
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:32,960
It was a really fun game for Gamecube and Road Rage, the Simpsons Road Rage. I have that too.

1064
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:34,800
So enough there.

1065
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:48,400
Yeah, games up there. Everything else broke, so everything else had to go in the trash.

1066
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:54,880
A lot of CD discs broke. I had Super Smash Bros for Gamecube. Both discs broke.

1067
01:56:55,440 --> 01:57:06,560
My favorite Pokemon game was Colosseum. Pokemon Colosseum was my favorite one. Was it Pokemon

1068
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:21,120
Colosseum? It was. Haha. It was my favorite Pokemon game. I played that on Gamecube.

1069
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:29,120
I played that like five times before it broke.

1070
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:42,640
A family member of mine thought that they could fix the Gamecube and they ended up

1071
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:47,440
breaking it further by taking it apart, so I could never play it again. Then they broke the

1072
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:51,440
discs to the Smash Bros and Colosseum.

1073
01:57:58,640 --> 01:58:03,360
Any Kirby? I didn't get to play Kirby. I was only allowed to watch, sadly.

1074
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:10,320
I was a brokey growing up, so I could only get my hands on so much. The majority of the games

1075
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:14,800
that I got was free. People who were done playing it and didn't want it anymore,

1076
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:22,080
so I was very lucky to be able to play a lot of the games. I think there was this one scary game

1077
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:29,040
with aliens or something on PlayStation 2. Extermination? I think it was called extermination.

1078
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:34,320
I don't have that anymore either. I used to play that too. I think it was the only scary game that

1079
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:46,000
I could stomach besides Resident Evil 6? Six and four? Or was it three? No, not three.

1080
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:50,320
Which one's the one with silver in it?

1081
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:03,040
Which one's that one? Which one was that one in Resident Evil?

1082
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:14,880
Five? Resident Evil 5? Yeah, that's the one. I can only play Resident Evil 5 and 6. It wasn't

1083
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:22,480
scary. It wasn't too scary for me. Don't have a lot of jump scares. Do I have a Wii? I do have a Wii.

1084
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:29,440
My favorite game to play on the Wii was the Michael Jackson game. It kept me fit.

1085
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:34,720
I knew all the dances, all the dance moves. I still do.

1086
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:46,160
I remember playing the dance games on the Gamecube 2. We had the little dance pad,

1087
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:56,880
the little plastic dance pad. You step on it. I remember that too. We had that too.

1088
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:12,880
Good night to anyone heading to bed. Have a sweet dream. Thank you for stopping by. Appreciate you.

1089
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:38,000
Is that real? It came with a Michael's glove? I think so. I don't remember.

1090
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:42,080
I don't remember the glove. We had the game for so long. I don't remember.

1091
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:48,400
It was really fun dancing to it. I would literally do that over stream.

1092
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:55,200
But I don't think we can play any other songs on stream. I don't think. I don't think.

1093
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:07,840
My first zombie game was Left 4 Dead. My first zombie game was Left 4 Dead too. I have it right up there.

1094
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:13,360
That was my very first game that I played. It was Left 4 Dead.

1095
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:23,040
Do you have Gamecube games to play it on? Do you have a Gamecube to play it on? No.

1096
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:32,960
I no longer have one. I haven't had one for over 10 years. It's been 10 years.

1097
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:36,720
I have one in a minute.

1098
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:41,520
That was one in a minute.

1099
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:58,240
I still have my remote controls though. I have an orange one and a gray one.

1100
02:01:58,240 --> 02:02:00,960
Had a purple one. I don't know where that went. Disappeared.

1101
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:05,600
I still have my orange remote. It was my favorite remote.

1102
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:12,640
Yeah, I still have it sitting right there.

1103
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:31,360
Do I have Gamecube games? Yeah, I do. I have the Bratz and Road Rage. The Simpsons Road Rage.

1104
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:38,560
Those are my only two Gamecube games I still have. I lost the Colosseum game. That was broken long time ago.

1105
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:43,200
Oh, and I have the Michael Jackson game.

1106
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:56,560
My mom is a little bit of a gamer, but I highly doubt that she'll let me touch her Mario game.

1107
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:04,000
I do not think she'll let me touch it.

1108
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:12,960
She bit me up.

1109
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:18,960
Highly doubt she'll let me touch that.

1110
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:22,240
She plays that like every day.

1111
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:33,040
She plays her Super Mario game every day. I think they got the newest one too.

1112
02:03:34,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Oh, I forgot I was writing the story. I guess I'm golfing story time.

1113
02:04:04,720 --> 02:04:11,440
Ah, I have two milks, one bread.

1114
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:19,920
I am via fritz now.

1115
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:32,000
Purchase. I ran up with our cheese in it.

1116
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:48,000
How much is she as? Oh, we can sell it for five dollars. She does it expensive. What the hell?

1117
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:08,240
I missed the crabs now.

1118
02:05:17,680 --> 02:05:22,000
Yeah, Pokemon Colosseum is my favorite Pokemon game for a long time.

1119
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Ah, I'm starting to get hit with the sleeps. I'm going to eat me really fast. I feel so old.

1120
02:05:52,000 --> 02:06:15,120
I would love to play Left 4 Dead with the girls. That sounds so fun.

1121
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:26,240
It's like a trip down memory lane. Like hardcore. Hardcore down memory lane.

1122
02:06:46,000 --> 02:07:01,280
Yeah, I remember. I remember playing Final Fantasy a long time ago.

1123
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:09,120
I remember it like it was yesterday. I didn't have a bed. I didn't have a bed frame. I didn't own one.

1124
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:22,960
I stopped on the floor. The hard floor. I remember. We had those big bulky TVs.

1125
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:33,920
You know, the old TVs. Big bulky TVs. I had to play PlayStation 2.

1126
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:45,520
That was the first time I got to play a game really, myself, to myself that I owned.

1127
02:07:46,000 --> 02:08:02,160
I remember I was given Final Fantasy X2 as a gift and I used to watch all the Final Fantasy games.

1128
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:07,840
I really like Final Fantasy and I think someone in my family was like, I heard you like this game.

1129
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:14,400
I don't know which one this is, but here's this one and it gave it to me and I played it.

1130
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:19,360
I never got to finish that game. Never got to finish it.

1131
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:28,880
There I got to finish it because the disc was scratched in a specific spot.

1132
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,360
A really small specific spot was damaged on the disc.

1133
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:39,840
So whenever I got near the ending of the game, it would freeze.

1134
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:47,680
The crash and freeze. I'd start over mainly because I didn't have a memory disc.

1135
02:08:48,240 --> 02:08:55,120
So I had to play the game from the start because I didn't own a memory disc. All my other memory

1136
02:08:55,120 --> 02:09:06,080
discs were lost or stolen. So I started the game over from the start and I would play all the way

1137
02:09:06,160 --> 02:09:10,160
through because I thought maybe it was just an issue with something and I'd play it all the way

1138
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:16,080
through and I'd get to that concert part. The concert. Never got to get to you.

1139
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:27,440
Never got to you. And then the game crashes. I realized that it was just a scratch on the disc

1140
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:38,560
and I was never going to be able to finish it. That was a good game though.

1141
02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:48,640
I did the same thing with Pokemon Colosseum as well. I finished the game and then someone

1142
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:58,320
lent me their, I had the disc still. Someone lent me their Gamecube and I got to play the game but

1143
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:04,960
I had to like zoom through it because I didn't have a memory disc. So I had to play it again

1144
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:14,320
one last time. That person was very nice and I gave them back their Gamecube. I was very happy.

1145
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:28,320
They lent me play one last time.

1146
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:45,040
I was so excited to get my first job.

1147
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:54,000
When I was crazy, my first job was actually this job. It was the job where I hurt my finger.

1148
02:10:54,000 --> 02:11:00,640
That was my very first job. My very first official job.

1149
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:14,800
I was so happy. I bought so many things. I bought this disc that I still have but unfortunately

1150
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:18,640
I messed up and I didn't realize that this disc was actually a dinner table.

1151
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:23,440
This is why I have a dinner table disc.

1152
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:45,280
So my clamp on for the for the my microphone stand thingy is like barely hanging on because

1153
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:51,520
this is not properly clamped because the outside part like comes out.

1154
02:11:55,280 --> 02:12:00,960
That's why I added a desk on the the thingy. I think I mentioned this before how I just add

1155
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:08,960
I add random things due to what I like experienced or went through. Like I could tell you a story

1156
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:14,560
almost all the things I added onto that list of things on the throne.

1157
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:24,560
So it was the first time I got that job and I started buying like I was saving up as much

1158
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:34,960
about this desk. I bought me a like a bed frame my first bed frame. I was lent the mattress.

1159
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:39,200
One gave me a mattress so I still have that mattress to this day.

1160
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:46,160
I got my first dresser because I never had a dresser.

1161
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:55,440
I had an old one and my cat used to sleep in it. He used to pull it open and he

1162
02:12:55,440 --> 02:13:00,720
will sleep at the bottom of it. I had a little table. I got my first TV.

1163
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:05,760
All of that with this job and these bookshelves and stuff.

1164
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:12,960
Then after that I saved up as much as possible and I got my first PC.

1165
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:21,440
I broke my motherboard to that PC though. It was an accident. It was my first time really like

1166
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:29,680
doing stuff with a PC. It was my very first time and I snapped my motherboard in half.

1167
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:49,680
I didn't know about like unscrewing stuff and how to move stuff. I thought I unscrewed it

1168
02:13:49,680 --> 02:13:55,760
really well and I was like moving stuff and then I like pulled on it. I'm like maybe I have to like

1169
02:13:55,760 --> 02:14:01,600
pull on it a little more and I pulled on it and it's like I'm like

1170
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:34,880
okay and then after that I broke. I got another PC and I broke my graphics card.

1171
02:14:36,720 --> 02:14:41,760
I yanked that out because the first one was really hard to come out so I thought it was

1172
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:48,960
going to be the same for the next one and I just yanked it out and the part that's usually like

1173
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:55,120
clamped in on the thingy came off and came off the graphics card.

1174
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:12,080
And then the fans broke on it too so that's the reason why I was taking it out. I was

1175
02:15:12,080 --> 02:15:17,280
going to try and replace the fans but then it ended up where I had to replace the whole thing.

1176
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:30,080
How expensive was that mistake? I was really broke so I had to, I was saving up a lot of

1177
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:36,560
money to get new parts so I had to use the money that I was saving up to get a new computer which

1178
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:46,800
only cost me like 800, 899 dollars. I got it on Black Friday. It was a Black Friday. I got it

1179
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:57,120
right after Thanksgiving. I got it on a Black Friday. Well, Cyber Monday. They call it Cyber

1180
02:15:57,120 --> 02:16:05,120
Monday. It's people who can't really go out on Black Friday so yeah I got it like 899 dollars.

1181
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:12,240
It was on sale. It was on sale. It was a really cheap computer.

1182
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:26,080
I still got it though it's falling apart and it's what I was streaming with

1183
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:36,000
before this for a while. I had to take off the glass because it was overheating and I needed

1184
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:45,120
to put a fan and like facing it to blow on it. It was overheating really bad. My CPU was bad.

1185
02:16:45,600 --> 02:16:54,960
Everything was bad. It was falling apart. I still got it. I was really surprised.

1186
02:16:56,720 --> 02:17:06,240
I was really happy when Strony found me and Strony found me. I had like the worst equipment.

1187
02:17:06,480 --> 02:17:15,200
So when everyone says, when everyone's really confused about why my audio and everything's

1188
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:25,680
so bad now, I had horrible equipment before this. I have no clue how to work this equipment.

1189
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:34,960
I'm so new to using all this stuff. It's so technical. I'm just like

1190
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:44,080
yeah yeah yeah yeah but I'm pretty nerdy and geeky in the sense where I like to study this

1191
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:52,240
stuff so I watched a bunch of videos learning how to work stuff. I'm learning. It's going to take

1192
02:17:52,240 --> 02:18:14,000
me time though. I had the worst equipment. So I'm very happy. Strony saved me.

1193
02:18:14,160 --> 02:18:26,800
Literally just before, just before things went down and I got the email. Two of my fans stopped

1194
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:39,600
working. Two of my fans stopped working. The fans on my graphics card. One of the fans wouldn't spin.

1195
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:45,920
She has saved me. She has saved me.

1196

1197
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:07,680
My monitors were like breaking slowly. The color in the monitors were leaving.

1198
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:18,240
It was bad. I was the brokest of the brokest. I have tape on everything. I currently have tape

Yeah.

1222
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:21,040
This game is fun. It's very like the fun game you just play on the side when you're especially

1223
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:28,400
when you're not all up there in the head. This is a great game to play especially when you're not

1224
02:24:28,400 --> 02:24:34,560
all up there in the head. You just relax and play this game and enjoy your time.

1225
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:45,040
Look at your shirt. I want to touch his forehead. It looks like it looks like it'll be soft.

1226
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:51,600
Oh that'll be soft. I'll touch you. Poke at it.

1227
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:54,560
Poke poke. Travis is back. They are.

1228
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:11,280
My head is hurting. My head is starting to hurt.

1229
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:27,280
Water. I don't need water.

1230
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:35,120
Whoa.

1231
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:50,000
Whoa. I had green grab. Green grab. So joy. It was good. Very yummy.

1234
02:26:07,520 --> 02:26:10,560
I wanted to save it for another special occasion.

1235
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:14,400
Oh. Well.

1236
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:31,280
Taking money back. You can take your money back by right clicking on the bills in the

1237
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:38,320
cash register. Thank you. I'll just take that. Thank you.

1238
02:26:40,560 --> 02:27:10,200
I think this will be the last day for this game.

1239
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:16,460
We'll get through this day and we'll just stop and chat it up for a bit.

1240
02:27:16,460 --> 02:27:17,960
Last day, last day.

1241
02:27:17,960 --> 02:27:27,160
I'm, I'm, yippee, like, yippee.

1242
02:27:27,160 --> 02:27:37,440
Well, I think it's my headphones.

1243
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:42,280
Do you guys ever get, like, these, like, crazy headaches from your headphones being on your

1244
02:27:42,280 --> 02:27:43,920
head for too long?

1245
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:49,760
And here's my headphones.

1246
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:55,320
They, like, squishing my head.

1247
02:27:55,320 --> 02:28:06,400
My head is being, like, squished, squished, and I'm hot, I'm so hot.

1248
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:08,640
Oh, get this off me!

1249
02:28:14,640 --> 02:28:16,520
Are you ever fine?

1250
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:18,600
Oh.

1251
02:28:18,600 --> 02:28:21,280
Oh, it's so hot.

1252
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:25,200
I'm burning.

1253
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:27,640
Oh my god.

1254
02:28:27,640 --> 02:28:29,800
Oh, I hate clothes.

1255
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:30,840
Why wear clothes?

1256
02:28:30,840 --> 02:28:33,280
Clothes is unnecessary.

1257
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:36,000
You don't need a...

1258
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,800
Oh.

1259
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:41,640
Oh.

1260
02:28:45,640 --> 02:28:49,120
Oh my god.

1261
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:52,600
Okay, I'm sorry if this fan...

1262
02:28:52,600 --> 02:28:54,240
Oh, it's too high.

1263
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:56,720
Are you?

1264
02:28:56,720 --> 02:29:00,880
Oh, okay.

1265
02:29:00,880 --> 02:29:03,000
It gets boiling in my room.

1266
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:04,360
You don't understand.

1267
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:10,000
If you guys didn't help me get this fan, I would have been melting in here.

1268
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:16,240
Like, like, this is what I was used to, this is what I had to deal with.

1269
02:29:16,240 --> 02:29:21,760
I would sweat, like, no tomorrow, and I usually don't sweat.

1270
02:29:21,760 --> 02:29:28,600
I sweat in random places, like, the bitties and stuff, you know?

1271
02:29:28,600 --> 02:29:32,120
It would sweat, like, crazy.

1272
02:29:32,120 --> 02:29:33,680
And my armpit, and that's it.

1273
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:34,920
I wouldn't sweat anywhere else.

1274
02:29:34,920 --> 02:29:36,400
My forehead, don't sweat.

1275
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:40,920
I'm dry everywhere else.

1276
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:51,320
So I don't know why, but I sweat everywhere else, like, under the bubba, under bubba, would

1277
02:29:51,320 --> 02:29:53,120
sweat, crazy.

1278
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:09,120
It gets so hot in here.

1279
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:18,120
Oh, man.

1280
02:30:18,120 --> 02:30:30,480
Well, I kind of, like, technically I suffer from headaches 24-7, so I'm, like, it could

1281
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:39,000
just be, like, a, you know, like, an addition, you know what I mean?

1282
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:50,160
Like, an addition, an additional pain, since, you know, I suffer from headaches all the time.

1283
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:57,160
So, like, the combination of the half-ones and everything else just, like, sucks.

1284
02:30:57,840 --> 02:30:59,840
Well.

1285
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:02,840
Oh, we passed the day.

1289
02:31:31,520 --> 02:31:36,520
But I'm done with Supermarket for now.

1290
02:31:36,520 --> 02:31:43,520

1291
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:52,520
Uh, yeah, I won't be a bigger, I'm too small to make me bigger.

But, uh, yeah, I like that, and it's gonna, uh, but, uh, it's a very chill game, I like it.

Your offering of this fan was the best, the best offering ever.

For your water balance

That's fine

1317
02:36:34,660 --> 02:36:36,180
Don't worry about that

02:36:36,180 --> 02:36:41,180
That's, that's fine, that's covered, that's okay.

1319
02:36:52,180 --> 02:36:55,140
I'm a little bit ipsy, but I'm coming off it.

1320
02:36:56,380 --> 02:36:59,380
I'm hungry and I haven't really eaten anything

1321
02:36:59,380 --> 02:37:00,820
except for this chicken.

1322
02:37:02,500 --> 02:37:04,380
And my stomach is like,

1323
02:37:06,260 --> 02:37:08,460
growling at me right now.

1324
02:37:18,540 --> 02:37:19,660
I'm really hungry.

1325
02:37:23,100 --> 02:37:28,100
I wanna order food, but I don't think it's a wise idea.

1326
02:37:29,300 --> 02:37:31,340
I got the bill leaves coming up.

1327
02:37:32,820 --> 02:37:34,380
I got the bills coming up.

1328
02:37:36,460 --> 02:37:41,460
And my, my mama Dulay left again.

1329
02:37:42,820 --> 02:37:47,820
She left, she's not here again, so I'm gonna starve.

1330
02:37:52,020 --> 02:37:54,180
My source of food is gone.

1331
02:38:06,300 --> 02:38:11,300
You stand in your shower, not me.

1332
02:38:20,060 --> 02:38:22,260
I sit in my shower like a psychopath.

1333
02:38:36,780 --> 02:38:41,740
I can't stand for long.

1334
02:38:41,740 --> 02:38:45,100
I can't even stand for longer than like 10 minutes, bro.

1335
02:38:45,100 --> 02:38:48,900
My spine hurts, I guess it's down.

1336
02:38:48,900 --> 02:38:51,140
I sit down and I let it run on me like,

1337
02:38:53,540 --> 02:38:58,220
a blasting hot boiling water right on my chest.

1338
02:39:06,860 --> 02:39:11,860
The water feels so good, it makes my legs wobble.

1339
02:39:11,860 --> 02:39:13,180
So I gotta sit down.

1340
02:39:16,100 --> 02:39:16,940
Go sit down.

1341
02:39:19,020 --> 02:39:20,940
Yo, my stomach is like,

1342
02:39:25,900 --> 02:39:29,540
I wish I could like, I wish you could like hear it.

1343
02:39:29,540 --> 02:39:32,420
I wish I could like bring you to it so you could hear it.

1344
02:39:32,420 --> 02:39:34,060
It is going.

1345
02:39:37,140 --> 02:39:39,900
I ate some cereal.

1346
02:39:39,900 --> 02:39:42,060
Maybe that'll just sum up my hunger.

1347
02:39:43,460 --> 02:39:44,620
I ate some cereal.

1348
02:39:50,620 --> 02:39:51,900
Yeah, here it goes.

1349
02:39:56,380 --> 02:39:57,220
Ah, no!

1350
02:39:57,220 --> 02:39:58,060
Ah, I got it.

1351
02:39:59,340 --> 02:40:02,620
Can't waste a single piece of cereal.

1352
02:40:03,620 --> 02:40:07,940
We brokeie brokeie, we can't waste a single piece.

1353
02:40:07,940 --> 02:40:09,180
It almost fell.

1354
02:40:33,620 --> 02:40:34,460
Mm.

1355
02:40:41,060 --> 02:40:43,220
Sitting in the shower is nasty work.

1356
02:40:43,220 --> 02:40:45,700
Hey, I cleaned the shower.

1357
02:40:45,700 --> 02:40:48,740
I wiped that, that I've wiped that bitch down real good,

1358
02:40:48,740 --> 02:40:49,580
all right?

1359
02:40:49,580 --> 02:40:53,620
If I clean it, it's clean enough for me, all right?

1360
02:40:53,620 --> 02:40:54,940
I have OCD.

1361
02:40:57,780 --> 02:40:59,620
Whoa, thank you, thank you so much

1362
02:40:59,620 --> 02:41:02,220
for the food all the time, thank you, thank you.

1363
02:41:03,620 --> 02:41:06,980
If I clean my shower, it's clean, all right?

1364
02:41:06,980 --> 02:41:08,860
I understand how people feel though,

1365
02:41:08,860 --> 02:41:11,580
about not wanting to shower in other people's showers.

1366
02:41:13,060 --> 02:41:14,140
Feel a little dirty.

1367
02:41:15,460 --> 02:41:17,060
I know that feeling.

1368
02:41:17,060 --> 02:41:19,340
My shower is good, right?

1369
02:41:19,340 --> 02:41:20,300
I clean it.

1370
02:41:23,540 --> 02:41:25,580
The bathroom is like my safe haven.

1371
02:41:27,380 --> 02:41:29,140
I spend the most time on there.

1372
02:41:30,620 --> 02:41:31,460
Oh, yeah.

1373
02:41:33,260 --> 02:41:35,980
I sit on a toilet watching memes for like,

1374
02:41:35,980 --> 02:41:37,980
for like three hours.

1375
02:41:40,460 --> 02:41:41,300
Oh.

1376
02:41:41,300 --> 02:41:42,140
Oh.

1377
02:41:43,140 --> 02:41:43,980
Mm-hmm.

1378
02:41:54,140 --> 02:41:54,980
Mm-hmm.

1379
02:42:00,420 --> 02:42:01,260
Mm-hmm.

1380
02:42:05,260 --> 02:42:06,100
Oh.

1381
02:42:08,180 --> 02:42:09,540
I didn't think about life.

1382
02:42:09,540 --> 02:42:11,300
I bring my phone with me.

1383
02:42:11,300 --> 02:42:13,620
I'm really sad when I forget my phone.

1384
02:42:16,340 --> 02:42:20,980
I get really sad, I'm like, no, no memes.

1385
02:42:20,980 --> 02:42:21,820
No.

1386
02:42:22,020 --> 02:42:22,860
Mm-hmm.

1387
02:42:28,180 --> 02:42:30,940
I know you start reading stuff off of like,

1388
02:42:30,940 --> 02:42:33,780
bottles, ingredients off the bottles.

1389
02:42:35,140 --> 02:42:35,980
Mm-hmm.

1390
02:42:36,060 --> 02:42:36,900
Mm-hmm.

1391
02:42:48,820 --> 02:42:50,420
Showering in other people's showers

1392
02:42:50,420 --> 02:42:51,820
is how you get foot fungus?

1393
02:42:51,820 --> 02:42:52,660
Ew.

1394
02:42:56,100 --> 02:42:58,100
You ain't gonna get that in my shower.

1395
02:42:58,100 --> 02:43:01,380
Not with my family's OCD.

1396
02:43:06,980 --> 02:43:09,220
You know how many times a week my,

1397
02:43:11,380 --> 02:43:12,220
my,

1398
02:43:15,220 --> 02:43:17,060
mama delay cleans?

1399
02:43:17,060 --> 02:43:18,460
Do you know how many times?

1400
02:43:20,380 --> 02:43:22,580
Yeah, I don't think you have to worry about foot fungus.

1401
02:43:24,580 --> 02:43:25,420
Mm-hmm.

1402
02:43:35,980 --> 02:43:36,820
Mm-hmm.

1403
02:43:44,500 --> 02:43:48,020
No, I think it's an average amount of time that you clean.

1404
02:43:53,420 --> 02:43:54,260
Mm-hmm.

1405
02:43:58,380 --> 02:44:00,700
She cleans every time she uses it.

1406
02:44:00,700 --> 02:44:03,660
Every time she uses the bathroom, she cleans it.

1407
02:44:03,660 --> 02:44:04,500
No.

1408
02:44:13,100 --> 02:44:14,340
I do the same thing.

1409
02:44:14,340 --> 02:44:16,100
I also clean it before I use it.

1410
02:44:17,180 --> 02:44:19,060
I wipe the seat down.

1411
02:44:19,060 --> 02:44:22,340
I don't want my poor, soft, sensitive skin touching the

1412
02:44:22,340 --> 02:44:24,100
seats that someone else sat on.

1413
02:44:28,100 --> 02:44:29,020
I'm nervous.

1414
02:44:30,060 --> 02:44:32,600
So I clean it every time before I sit on it.

1415
02:44:33,660 --> 02:44:34,500
Mm-hmm.

1416
02:44:44,780 --> 02:44:46,100
Mm.

1417
02:44:46,100 --> 02:44:47,780
Thank you, thank you for the $2 to help.

1418
02:44:47,780 --> 02:44:49,660
Thank you, I'm not a mouse.

1419
02:44:49,660 --> 02:44:50,500
Thank you.

1420
02:45:02,460 --> 02:45:03,620
Mm-hmm.

1421
02:45:03,620 --> 02:45:04,780
Thank you, thank you.

1422
02:45:04,780 --> 02:45:05,620
Mm-hmm.

1423
02:45:08,380 --> 02:45:09,220
Oh.

1424
02:45:14,820 --> 02:45:17,860
Thinking about life as reserve for the shower.

1425
02:45:17,860 --> 02:45:20,300
I think about some ratchet things in the shower.

1426
02:45:20,620 --> 02:45:21,460
Mm-hmm.

1427
02:45:21,460 --> 02:45:22,300
Mm-hmm.

1428
02:45:27,940 --> 02:45:29,820
My imagination runs wild.

1429
02:45:31,340 --> 02:45:32,180
Mm-hmm.

1430
02:45:34,620 --> 02:45:37,620
Sometimes I even bring my iPad with me.

1431
02:45:37,620 --> 02:45:39,940
iPad and put it on a little stand.

1432
02:45:39,940 --> 02:45:42,420
And I watch things in the shower.

1433
02:45:42,420 --> 02:45:43,260
Mm-hmm.

1434
02:45:58,140 --> 02:46:00,020
Yes, you may, you may use my lap.

1435
02:46:00,540 --> 02:46:01,740
You can use my lap.

1436
02:46:01,740 --> 02:46:03,140
I'm always sitting in chat.

1437
02:46:12,340 --> 02:46:13,180
Mm-hmm.

1438
02:46:19,180 --> 02:46:20,020
Mm-hmm.

1439
02:46:30,020 --> 02:46:30,860
Mm-hmm.

1440
02:46:39,020 --> 02:46:39,860
Mm-hmm.

1441
02:46:43,700 --> 02:46:44,540
Mm-hmm.

1442
02:46:44,540 --> 02:46:46,460
Shower iPad is wild.

1443
02:46:46,460 --> 02:46:47,300
Oh, man.

1444
02:46:49,220 --> 02:46:51,260
Man, I'm bored, I get bored.

1445
02:46:52,380 --> 02:46:54,660
Did you get bored taking a shower?

1446
02:46:54,660 --> 02:46:56,860
I'm bored, I gotta bring some entertainment.

1447
02:46:56,860 --> 02:46:57,700
Oh, man.

1448
02:46:57,700 --> 02:46:59,780
I'm bored, I gotta bring some entertainment.

1449
02:46:59,780 --> 02:47:00,620
Oh.

1450
02:47:00,620 --> 02:47:01,460
Oh, man.

1451
02:47:19,460 --> 02:47:22,020
Clearly, she means she watches my hero academia.

1452
02:47:22,020 --> 02:47:23,460
I do.

1453
02:47:23,460 --> 02:47:24,940
But not on the iPad.

1454
02:47:27,700 --> 02:47:28,540
Mm-hmm.

1455
02:47:42,540 --> 02:47:43,620
I mean my cereal.

1456
02:47:45,660 --> 02:47:47,060
That's actually really good.

1457
02:47:48,140 --> 02:47:49,740
Tasted really good.

1458
02:47:49,740 --> 02:47:51,740
I'm running out of cereal.

1459
02:47:51,740 --> 02:47:52,580
No.

1460
02:47:57,700 --> 02:47:58,540
Mm-hmm.

1461
02:48:10,620 --> 02:48:12,340
I always play music while I shower,

1462
02:48:12,340 --> 02:48:14,620
so I don't have to think about life.

1463
02:48:14,620 --> 02:48:16,220
Music isn't enough for me.

1464
02:48:17,580 --> 02:48:20,060
Music, I resonate with music too much

1465
02:48:20,060 --> 02:48:24,780
that it puts me in the, it makes me think sometimes.

1466
02:48:24,780 --> 02:48:27,500
So instead, I gotta dance in the shower

1467
02:48:27,540 --> 02:48:28,820
while playing music.

1468
02:48:32,100 --> 02:48:35,820
But sometimes, because my range in music is so broad,

1469
02:48:36,700 --> 02:48:38,780
if I play with songs on shuffle,

1470
02:48:38,780 --> 02:48:41,420
there's a high chance I'm gonna get hit with a sad song.

1471
02:48:41,420 --> 02:48:42,540
And I don't want that song.

1472
02:48:44,340 --> 02:48:46,100
I already had that happen twice.

1473
02:48:47,540 --> 02:48:48,780
And I said to myself,

1474
02:48:48,780 --> 02:48:51,780
I am not gonna play music, it's a shower anymore.

1475
02:48:52,780 --> 02:48:58,580
I had me sad, and it had me feeling like Vegeta in the rain.

1476
02:49:03,940 --> 02:49:06,100
That Vegeta gift in the rain.

1477
02:49:22,620 --> 02:49:24,500
You scared to put your electronics in your water?

1478
02:49:24,500 --> 02:49:25,740
Just get a little cover.

1479
02:49:25,740 --> 02:49:27,100
Get a water cover.

1480
02:49:27,100 --> 02:49:28,900
Protect your electronics.

1481
02:49:29,900 --> 02:49:30,740
It'll be fine.

1482
02:49:30,740 --> 02:49:31,580
Mm-hmm.

1483
02:49:34,740 --> 02:49:35,580
No!

1484
02:49:36,580 --> 02:49:38,380
I dropped some cereal.

1485
02:49:38,380 --> 02:49:39,220
No!

1486
02:49:48,220 --> 02:49:49,060
Mm-hmm.

1487
02:49:51,780 --> 02:49:52,620
Mm-hmm.

1488
02:50:02,100 --> 02:50:05,180
I watched anime in the shower.

1489
02:50:05,180 --> 02:50:06,020
I'd do them.

1490
02:50:06,860 --> 02:50:09,620
I even watched a movie in the shower.

1491
02:50:09,620 --> 02:50:10,460
Mm-hmm.

1492
02:50:10,460 --> 02:50:11,300
Mm-hmm.

1493
02:50:22,620 --> 02:50:23,460
Mm-hmm.

1494
02:50:26,620 --> 02:50:27,900
That's why you gotta make a playlist

1495
02:50:27,900 --> 02:50:29,980
for specific moods.

1496
02:50:33,140 --> 02:50:34,860
I'm too organized that

1497
02:50:37,580 --> 02:50:38,940
my playlists are like

1498
02:50:40,460 --> 02:50:41,380
emo,

1499
02:50:43,060 --> 02:50:43,900
rock,

1500
02:50:46,900 --> 02:50:48,660
Japanese openings,

1501
02:50:49,540 --> 02:50:50,660
and songs.

1502
02:50:52,140 --> 02:50:53,060
K-pop.

1503
02:50:54,460 --> 02:50:55,300
R&B.

1504
02:51:06,700 --> 02:51:08,380
My playlist is too broad.

1505
02:51:09,500 --> 02:51:10,340
I can't do that,

1506
02:51:10,340 --> 02:51:13,660
because then one day I'm gonna be listening to rock,

1507
02:51:13,660 --> 02:51:14,500
and I'm like,

1508
02:51:15,860 --> 02:51:17,140
and then I'm gonna be like,

1509
02:51:17,140 --> 02:51:19,300
well, I wanna listen to this specific song

1510
02:51:19,300 --> 02:51:20,940
that's also kind of rock-ish,

1511
02:51:20,940 --> 02:51:21,900
but it's not rock-ish.

1512
02:51:21,900 --> 02:51:23,180
It's in the Japanese playlist.

1513
02:51:23,180 --> 02:51:24,660
Now I gotta go to the Japanese playlist

1514
02:51:24,660 --> 02:51:25,820
and you'll find the song.

1515
02:51:26,820 --> 02:51:27,860
Just to play the song.

1516
02:51:27,860 --> 02:51:30,100
That's why I just leave everything on shuffle.

1517
02:51:30,100 --> 02:51:30,940
Mm-hmm.

1518
02:51:33,300 --> 02:51:34,580
Just leave it on shuffle.

1519
02:51:46,380 --> 02:51:48,780
Do I listen to blues rock music?

1520
02:51:48,780 --> 02:51:50,220
I think so.

1521
02:51:50,220 --> 02:51:51,140
Sometimes.

1522
02:51:52,740 --> 02:51:53,780
What's cereal you're eating?

1523
02:51:53,780 --> 02:51:55,020
My favorite kind.

1524
02:51:56,860 --> 02:51:58,140
Captain Crunch,

1525
02:51:58,140 --> 02:51:59,020
peanut butter.

1526
02:52:14,140 --> 02:52:16,260
I'm not pouring another bowl.

1527
02:52:16,260 --> 02:52:18,340
I didn't eat the other one really fast.

1528
02:52:18,340 --> 02:52:20,260
I don't know what you're talking about.

1529
02:52:20,260 --> 02:52:22,100
This is only my second bowl.

1530
02:52:22,100 --> 02:52:22,940
Right?

1531
02:52:41,860 --> 02:52:43,380
I like cinnamon toast crunch,

1532
02:52:43,380 --> 02:52:44,220
but...

1533
02:52:45,220 --> 02:52:48,660
Okay, let's see it this way.

1534
02:52:48,660 --> 02:52:52,620
Imagine eating something for three years straight.

1535
02:52:52,620 --> 02:52:53,620
The same thing.

1536
02:52:53,620 --> 02:52:55,820
Nothing else, nothing new.

1537
02:52:55,820 --> 02:52:57,300
Three years straight.

1538
02:52:57,300 --> 02:52:58,660
The same thing.

1539
02:52:58,660 --> 02:53:03,660
Over and over and over and over and over and over again.

1540
02:53:05,580 --> 02:53:07,380
Are you not gonna get tired of it?

1541
02:53:08,940 --> 02:53:11,740
Cinnamon toast crunch used to be my favorite cereal

1542
02:53:11,740 --> 02:53:12,660
in the past.

1543
02:53:15,060 --> 02:53:19,540
But it was all my mom ever bought.

1544
02:53:23,580 --> 02:53:25,820
So I got tired of it really fast.

1545
02:53:44,860 --> 02:53:45,820
Three years straight.

1546
02:53:47,860 --> 02:53:49,260
It was all we could afford.

1547
02:53:51,060 --> 02:53:52,300
All the other brands were,

1548
02:53:52,300 --> 02:53:54,300
or stuff were a little more expensive.

1549
02:53:55,700 --> 02:53:57,460
But we couldn't get anything else.

1550
02:53:59,220 --> 02:54:02,980
She would only buy that and Lucky Charms.

1551
02:54:02,980 --> 02:54:04,860
But we weren't allowed to eat the Lucky Charms.

1552
02:54:04,860 --> 02:54:06,860
They were hers and hers alone.

1553
02:54:07,900 --> 02:54:08,860
Oh, we ate Lucky Charms.

1554
02:54:08,860 --> 02:54:09,820
You'd get angry.

1555
02:54:14,620 --> 02:54:17,140
Sorry I have a lot of aunties within my class.

1556
02:54:22,340 --> 02:54:23,940
I would star in an ice cream bar,

1557
02:54:23,940 --> 02:54:24,500
a hit sparkling tea bar

1558
02:54:24,500 --> 02:54:25,660
or a social television bar,

1559
02:54:25,660 --> 02:54:27,660
too stupid to be an ice cream lover.

1560
02:54:27,700 --> 02:54:31,660
I would be an ice cream lover if they'd offered me ice cream.

1561
02:54:32,460 --> 02:54:33,620
Friends would do that,

1562
02:54:33,620 --> 02:54:34,980
without 보이 rice and other cereals.

1563
02:54:37,820 --> 02:54:39,340
Three, four, three, four.

1564
02:54:39,340 --> 02:54:40,220
Let's go.

1565
02:54:44,220 --> 02:54:46,220
How long was your longest shower?

1566
02:54:48,140 --> 02:54:50,340
Five hours I fell asleep. I

1567
02:54:51,860 --> 02:54:54,500
Fell asleep then slid down and almost drowned

1568
02:55:14,220 --> 02:55:18,980
It woke me up there's a great big splash to the face

1569
02:55:44,820 --> 02:55:46,820
I

1570
02:55:49,780 --> 02:55:51,780
Rice is different though

1571
02:55:52,220 --> 02:55:56,460
You ate rice for 22 years rice is different. I fucking love rice

1572
02:55:56,460 --> 02:56:02,260
I don't think I'll ever get tired of rice. You could do so many things with rice so many different combinations with rice

1573
02:56:02,260 --> 02:56:04,260
Rice is like the best the best thing ever

1574
02:56:05,100 --> 02:56:07,820
People talk down a white rice. Right rice is amazing

1575
02:56:07,820 --> 02:56:09,820
A little bit of salt

1576
02:56:12,500 --> 02:56:15,540
Me some rice fried rice work rice

1577
02:56:17,620 --> 02:56:19,620
All the rice

1578
02:56:19,780 --> 02:56:23,940
Rice and peas rice and beans rice rice rice rice rice rice rice

1579
02:56:25,980 --> 02:56:29,340
That's literally why I put a rice cooker on my throat

1580
02:56:38,660 --> 02:56:44,380
My family has a rice cooker, but I'm not allowed to use it

1581
02:56:46,380 --> 02:56:48,900
I'm not allowed to use the the rice cooker

1582
02:56:53,900 --> 02:56:58,980
It's cuz I have really bad memory my memory is really really really bad and

1583
02:57:03,060 --> 02:57:07,220
My my mom wasn't aware that if you leave the rice cooker closed

1584
02:57:08,020 --> 02:57:11,220
Insealed the rice is still good for the next day

1585
02:57:12,580 --> 02:57:14,580
It's still good for the next day

1586
02:57:15,220 --> 02:57:19,660
But she kept opening it and then leaving it open

1587
02:57:20,460 --> 02:57:23,500
And then complaining that there was mold on it

1588
02:57:24,060 --> 02:57:26,060
I

1589
02:57:34,260 --> 02:57:42,580
So I had a teacher to stop opening it and leaving it open but because of the whole situation medication time

1590
02:57:53,660 --> 02:57:59,340
My alarm went off medication time

1591
02:58:01,100 --> 02:58:04,140
But I had to teach her not to open it and stuff

1592
02:58:04,700 --> 02:58:10,260
But because of the whole situation it took me like months to teach her not to do it or touch it or whatever

1593
02:58:11,220 --> 02:58:17,260
When she started doing it and leaving it closed. I thought that she was cleaning it out and

1594
02:58:17,980 --> 02:58:20,020
I would forget about it

1595
02:58:20,940 --> 02:58:25,260
I would completely forget about it. So I'd leave it in there for like days

1596
02:58:27,060 --> 02:58:29,060
Until it was time for me to use it again

1597
02:58:31,380 --> 02:58:33,700
So the rice was still in the collecting mold

1598
02:58:46,780 --> 02:58:49,820
So yeah, I would forget about it being in there

1599
02:58:50,140 --> 02:58:52,140
and then I would collect mold

1600
02:58:56,340 --> 02:59:00,340
But it's different if the rice cooker belonged to me and only me

1601
02:59:00,340 --> 02:59:05,340
I'd freely be able to eat out of it save food and I have to worry about people touching it

1602
02:59:05,340 --> 02:59:11,020
If no one's touching it then I can I will know when something's in it and when something isn't in it

1603
02:59:11,580 --> 02:59:13,580
And I would solely clean it myself

1604
02:59:20,420 --> 02:59:23,900
It was just really annoying because she would like

1605
02:59:25,500 --> 02:59:27,500
She would like take a picture

1606
02:59:28,220 --> 02:59:32,260
Send it to me, but like hey look it's moldy

1607
02:59:33,900 --> 02:59:39,140
Am I okay? Right? I'm gonna clean it. Clean it

1608
02:59:41,500 --> 02:59:44,540
And she just keep doing that over and over

1609
02:59:44,940 --> 02:59:51,260
Even if someone else used it, I had to clean it. So it was annoying. It was very annoying

1610
03:00:00,580 --> 03:00:09,760
To constantly be annoyed by it my brain just automatically like just no longer cared about it anymore

1611
03:00:10,200 --> 03:00:12,200
I

1612
03:00:12,480 --> 03:00:14,480
Stressed out over a rice cooker

1613
03:00:18,320 --> 03:00:24,360
I was like I'll forget about it. I just won't eat rice won't make my own rice anymore

1614
03:00:26,760 --> 03:00:29,640
After a rice is good for fried white rice, it's true

1615
03:00:40,400 --> 03:00:42,900
I'm right so bad

1616
03:00:49,680 --> 03:00:51,680
You met a cereal by the way

1617
03:01:00,160 --> 03:01:06,560
You had fried chicken and fried rice for dinner nice. I only had fried chicken, but it wasn't for dinner

1618
03:01:07,280 --> 03:01:08,880
sadly

1619
03:01:08,880 --> 03:01:10,880
It was for lunch

1620
03:01:13,920 --> 03:01:15,920
My mom made it before she left

1621
03:01:25,560 --> 03:01:32,560
Excuse me to talk about rice. Rice is amazing. What? You don't have time to talk about rice

1622
03:01:38,880 --> 03:01:40,880
I

1623
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:53,600
Don't realize

1624
03:02:08,960 --> 03:02:12,120
I think the most food traumatizing thing

1625
03:02:12,760 --> 03:02:18,020
That my mom did was forced me to eat mushrooms. It's one of the reasons why I don't like mushrooms

1626
03:02:18,520 --> 03:02:20,880
I'm a little traumatized from mushrooms

1627
03:02:23,240 --> 03:02:25,240
So I really don't like mushrooms

1628
03:02:26,560 --> 03:02:30,360
She would make us eat it we were broke II so she would force us to eat

1629
03:02:32,240 --> 03:02:35,400
One thing she'd would make was you know spaghetti and meatballs

1630
03:02:36,400 --> 03:02:41,480
Spaghetti and meatballs minus the meatball replace it with mushrooms

1631
03:02:42,920 --> 03:02:44,920
She'd make that all the time

1632
03:02:47,280 --> 03:02:51,400
All the time and I can't I can't I can't no

1633
03:02:52,680 --> 03:02:54,680
No

1634
03:03:05,400 --> 03:03:07,400
Oh

1635
03:03:18,440 --> 03:03:23,000
She would get so angry we wouldn't finish our food she'd make us stay up at the table

1636
03:03:23,640 --> 03:03:28,360
We have to sit there and she was like you can't leave you can't go to bed unless you finish this

1637
03:03:29,080 --> 03:03:34,760
Me and my my siblings

1638
03:03:38,280 --> 03:03:41,800
We were such bad children ah

1639
03:03:45,560 --> 03:03:50,000
We would find multiple ways to dispose of the evidence

1640
03:03:58,600 --> 03:04:00,600
Oh

1641
03:04:12,760 --> 03:04:20,680
No, we chuck it chuck it out the window we hide it we'll flush it

1642
03:04:28,360 --> 03:04:30,360
So bad

1643
03:04:48,360 --> 03:04:50,360
Oh man

1644
03:04:50,360 --> 03:04:52,360
Oh

1645
03:04:59,800 --> 03:05:05,400
We used to be such food wasters things changed after that

1646
03:05:08,120 --> 03:05:10,120
Things changed so much

1647
03:05:12,680 --> 03:05:15,080
I remember being um

1648
03:05:15,160 --> 03:05:22,120
We were like I experienced true starvation for the first time

1649
03:05:22,840 --> 03:05:24,840
We were homeless for a little bit

1650
03:05:25,560 --> 03:05:27,560
For a little bit we were homeless

1651
03:05:28,120 --> 03:05:29,400
Yeah

1652
03:05:29,400 --> 03:05:31,400
Yeah, like a big dead

1653
03:05:31,720 --> 03:05:33,720
We're homeless

1654
03:05:33,800 --> 03:05:35,800
I've been homeless before

1655
03:05:35,880 --> 03:05:37,160
So I know

1656
03:05:37,160 --> 03:05:39,160
I'm gonna have a big tail and

1657
03:05:39,640 --> 03:05:41,640
We won't eat for

1658
03:05:42,200 --> 03:05:43,960
For so long

1659
03:05:44,040 --> 03:05:46,040
And all I would eat was bread

1660
03:05:46,040 --> 03:05:49,400
Bread bread. I love bread. It's my savior

1661
03:05:51,240 --> 03:05:53,240
Uh

1662
03:05:53,480 --> 03:05:58,600
I felt so bad about how much food I wasted in the past

1663
03:06:01,800 --> 03:06:03,800
Makes you really think

1664
03:06:08,280 --> 03:06:10,680
I'm not out of the clear water yet

1665
03:06:11,640 --> 03:06:14,200
I'm barely hanging on with rent

1666
03:06:17,080 --> 03:06:19,080
We're barely hanging on

1667
03:06:21,480 --> 03:06:24,360
But hopefully you're hopefully it won't happen again

1668
03:06:26,120 --> 03:06:28,120
We're fine now

1669
03:06:28,600 --> 03:06:30,600
For now

1670
03:06:30,600 --> 03:06:32,600
I

1671
03:06:39,240 --> 03:06:45,400
Thank you appreciate that. That's very sweet of you to say about my love. Thank you

1672
03:06:50,520 --> 03:06:53,480
They were chopped mushrooms by the way

1673
03:07:00,840 --> 03:07:07,000
Is it a flavor thing or texture thing? No, it's just trauma. I think it's just trauma

1674
03:07:08,920 --> 03:07:10,920
Uh mental mental thing

1675
03:07:13,400 --> 03:07:18,040
I get really nauseous whenever I try to eat a mushroom every now and then

1676
03:07:19,960 --> 03:07:24,760
They're really nauseous even if I eat it and I don't know what's a mushroom. It's like

1677
03:07:25,800 --> 03:07:28,120
It's like a taste you can't really forget

1678
03:07:30,840 --> 03:07:32,840
So I think it's just a mental thing

1679
03:07:33,800 --> 03:07:38,600
Same goes for raisins. I used to really like raisins a lot growing up

1680
03:07:39,320 --> 03:07:41,320
but again trauma

1681
03:07:41,800 --> 03:07:48,680
My grandma my grandma's house when I stayed with her she had a mice and stuff and

1682
03:07:49,400 --> 03:07:51,400
bugs infestation and

1683
03:07:52,920 --> 03:07:54,920
Wasn't like extremely bad, but

1684
03:07:57,160 --> 03:07:59,160
Her food was not safe

1685
03:08:00,040 --> 03:08:01,880
um

1686
03:08:01,880 --> 03:08:04,280
I think flies got into the

1687
03:08:05,240 --> 03:08:06,600
raisins

1688
03:08:06,600 --> 03:08:08,600
And I was eating them

1689
03:08:08,920 --> 03:08:14,760
Eating the box of raisins. It's just enjoying them. Hmm raisins. Yum. Yum. Yum. So good. Hmm

1690
03:08:15,640 --> 03:08:18,360
And then I poured out the last little bit into my hand

1691
03:08:19,400 --> 03:08:23,640
And there were about four maggots in my hand

1692
03:08:23,880 --> 03:08:25,880
And

1693
03:08:27,400 --> 03:08:29,400
Swiggling about in my hand

1694
03:08:31,480 --> 03:08:33,480
And ever since then I never ate raisins

1695
03:08:54,520 --> 03:08:59,080
You let an interesting life, I guess I suppose so

1696
03:09:01,480 --> 03:09:03,480
I've been through quite a lot

1697
03:09:23,880 --> 03:09:25,880
I

1698
03:09:31,320 --> 03:09:35,560
Have like so many stories I can tell you guys I have I have

1699
03:09:36,280 --> 03:09:39,320
I've been through quite a bit and they're very memorable

1700
03:09:40,440 --> 03:09:42,440
I remember stuff when I was five

1701
03:09:43,240 --> 03:09:48,200
I was five years old. I remember stuff way back then a lot of memories

1702
03:09:49,160 --> 03:09:54,600
I remember it's pretty good when it comes to remembering the really really good and the really really bad

1703
03:09:56,520 --> 03:09:58,520
But it's not good for much anything else

1704
03:10:00,840 --> 03:10:04,360
It has to have a stain on my brain for me to remember

1705
03:10:04,440 --> 03:10:06,440
I

1706
03:10:13,240 --> 03:10:18,200
Give me the elevator perch for your weirdest stories mention them speaking of elevators

1707
03:10:20,760 --> 03:10:26,520
Speaking of elevators, I have a bunch of elevator story for you

1708
03:10:34,920 --> 03:10:36,920
I

1709
03:10:42,520 --> 03:10:49,880
Didn't get stuck in an elevator that's old news. Come on. Everybody has had had gone. They had been stuck. Wow

1710
03:10:53,080 --> 03:10:55,080
Wow

1711
03:10:55,560 --> 03:10:57,560
Wow

1712
03:10:57,960 --> 03:11:03,240
English English is great

1713
03:11:06,840 --> 03:11:11,240
Everyone's gone stuck in an elevator at least once at least once

1714
03:11:13,800 --> 03:11:15,800
I got stuck in an elevator twice

1715
03:11:17,480 --> 03:11:19,480
twice

1716
03:11:20,760 --> 03:11:23,160
I was really really really young when the first time it happened

1717
03:11:23,880 --> 03:11:29,400
And there was a blackout and the elevator stopped working the blackout in the building and the elevator stopped working

1718
03:11:30,440 --> 03:11:34,040
So it was dark in the elevator. I remember being in an elevator with other people

1719
03:11:34,120 --> 03:11:39,160
I didn't really know what was happening. I was confused. So I was like, what's happening? Why is it so dark? And then

1720
03:11:40,440 --> 03:11:42,440
I was in an elevator with like a

1721
03:11:43,240 --> 03:11:46,440
family member and they were screaming at the top foot there

1722
03:11:46,520 --> 03:11:53,640
And that is what scared me. I'm actually really terrified of the dark and terrified of elevators

1723
03:11:55,240 --> 03:12:03,480
All right, let me put on details more details. It's not just elevators. I'm afraid of I'm afraid of man-made machinery

1724
03:12:06,840 --> 03:12:14,120
Man-made machinery that can and will mount function as what I'm afraid of I have a fear of machines

1725
03:12:16,520 --> 03:12:19,720
But I have no other choice but to use them. So I tough through it

1726
03:12:20,200 --> 03:12:24,120
I tough through it. I'm also claustrophobic. So yeah

1727
03:12:27,320 --> 03:12:29,320
Yes, I'm scared of escalators as well

1728
03:12:29,960 --> 03:12:34,440
I get shaky knees when I'm on them, but I have no other choice. I'm also afraid of planes

1729
03:12:35,160 --> 03:12:36,920
I'm afraid of planes

1730
03:12:36,920 --> 03:12:38,600
I'm not

1731
03:12:38,600 --> 03:12:40,440
super afraid of cars

1732
03:12:40,440 --> 03:12:42,440
But I I do

1733
03:12:43,400 --> 03:12:49,240
Get really really sick. I don't know if it's motion sickness, but I doubt it because I've been on a boat

1734
03:12:50,280 --> 03:12:55,880
I don't think it's motion sickness. I think I just get car sick the smell of the car

1735
03:12:56,520 --> 03:13:00,120
Being in it feeling closed off

1736
03:13:01,560 --> 03:13:03,560
I uh

1737
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:07,000
Oh, I'm sorry give me a second

1738
03:13:08,280 --> 03:13:09,720
Wow

1739
03:13:09,720 --> 03:13:11,720
Even thinking about it makes me freak out

1740
03:13:13,080 --> 03:13:14,520
a little

1741
03:13:14,520 --> 03:13:19,240
Panic attack and then I uh, I get really nauseous and I really massive headache

1742
03:13:20,520 --> 03:13:22,520
Massive really big

1743
03:13:24,200 --> 03:13:27,240
So the only way I could ride in a car is if I uh

1744
03:13:34,920 --> 03:13:36,920
If I have a window open

1745
03:13:36,920 --> 03:13:38,920
I

1746
03:13:40,440 --> 03:13:42,600
But I tough through it usually I don't say anything

1747
03:13:42,600 --> 03:13:47,400
I sit in the car really quietly and I like lean my head against the door and I don't say anything

1748
03:13:48,120 --> 03:13:52,520
I don't want no one to worry or freak out and stuff the last time I brought it up to

1749
03:13:52,920 --> 03:13:57,880
It was like I was in a cab and the person in the cab freaked out because I was like panicking

1750
03:13:58,120 --> 03:14:02,840
I was like, please please can you open a window and they were like, it's cold. I was like, please please

1751
03:14:03,080 --> 03:14:05,080
Please please please please and they were like

1752
03:14:05,880 --> 03:14:08,680
And then I freaked out and then I freaked out and then we were freaking out

1753
03:14:10,760 --> 03:14:12,760
So I just don't say anything

1754
03:14:20,680 --> 03:14:26,440
I know what I don't want I don't want I don't want to freak out my hands are shaking. Oh my gosh

1755
03:14:33,480 --> 03:14:37,640
And I think I've been in a near accident in a car before

1756
03:14:38,120 --> 03:14:42,280
I've been in an accident twice, but the other one wasn't that bad, but I think it was like

1757
03:14:43,160 --> 03:14:47,400
Uh, one of my family members kind of scared me

1758
03:14:48,360 --> 03:14:50,680
They were like, oh, we got to be careful. We got to be careful

1759
03:14:51,640 --> 03:14:56,920
We're all gonna be doomed and oh it's gonna be over and then she started doing a prayer and I was like, oh my god

1760
03:14:57,080 --> 03:14:59,080
I'm going to die

1761
03:14:59,080 --> 03:15:01,080
Oh

1762
03:15:29,400 --> 03:15:31,400
Oh

1763
03:15:42,200 --> 03:15:47,640
But yeah, I've been stuck at elevator a couple of times, but I think the funny elevator stories I have for you

1764
03:15:48,040 --> 03:15:50,040
Don't have to really deal with these

1765
03:15:50,040 --> 03:15:52,040
It's just

1766
03:15:53,080 --> 03:15:55,080
Sorry

1767
03:15:59,080 --> 03:16:02,280
It's not my story, but let me tell you

1768
03:16:04,760 --> 03:16:06,760
About my mom

1769
03:16:09,800 --> 03:16:12,200
I'm tearing up already

1770
03:16:13,160 --> 03:16:20,600
So, you know, I I live in a in a place where you know bugs are a big problem

1771
03:16:21,640 --> 03:16:24,760
And you know what kind of like bug is a really big problem

1774
03:16:30,440 --> 03:16:33,320
And a creepy crawly, you know, they're big and gross

1775
03:16:34,040 --> 03:16:35,640
We call them

1776
03:16:35,640 --> 03:16:41,080
Waterbugs, but I know what a real water bug looks like. It's not really a water bug. It's just a giant

1777
03:16:42,760 --> 03:16:44,760
Cockroach

1778
03:16:45,400 --> 03:16:47,400
This is a really big one

1779
03:16:48,120 --> 03:16:50,120
And you know

1780
03:16:50,600 --> 03:16:56,840
You know, they're really not nice to be around. They're scary. They're big. They're massive

1781
03:16:57,800 --> 03:17:01,000
No, it's like it's a cockroach cockroach

1782
03:17:02,200 --> 03:17:07,000
Those those are not nice. Those are gross. They're gross and they're massive

1783
03:17:12,840 --> 03:17:19,320
Well, my mom got into an elevator with a kind gentleman

1784
03:17:23,080 --> 03:17:31,240
She got into the elevator with a kind gentleman and they were added up in the elevator

1785
03:17:34,040 --> 03:17:36,280
And bam, there it was

1786
03:17:37,160 --> 03:17:44,360
It was crawling about and my mom she really just

1787
03:17:47,080 --> 03:17:52,200
She does not like insects. She does not like them at all not one bit

1788
03:17:58,200 --> 03:18:05,560
And did you do you know a fun fact about cockroaches you want to know a fun fact

1789
03:18:06,280 --> 03:18:08,280
You

1790
03:18:25,560 --> 03:18:29,000
The cockroaches have this thing they can do

1791
03:18:30,040 --> 03:18:33,400
Cockroaches have this really cool thing they can do

1792
03:18:34,120 --> 03:18:36,120
Which is fly

1793
03:18:36,600 --> 03:18:38,600
They can fly

1794
03:18:54,360 --> 03:19:02,760
So this cockroach starts flying and it's flying everywhere and then she's stuck in this elevator with this kind gentleman

1795
03:19:02,760 --> 03:19:09,320
And she sits flying and she's screaming and she's screaming

1796
03:19:32,840 --> 03:19:41,400
And she starts clinging to this poor man

1797
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:50,520
She's holding him for dear life. She's clinging to him like a Scooby-Doo

1798
03:20:03,320 --> 03:20:05,320
Oh

1799
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:25,000
Oh god

1800
03:20:25,160 --> 03:20:27,160

And you know what makes it better, you know what makes why I laugh so hard you want to know why I laugh so hard

1802
03:20:45,720 --> 03:20:53,720
It's because I could hear everything I can hear I hear screaming

1803
03:20:55,400 --> 03:20:57,400
Ah

1804
03:21:06,920 --> 03:21:15,640
That's a lot she was screaming she was screaming so loud I can't hear everything she's in the elevator

1805
03:21:17,080 --> 03:21:21,960
And she came out she said she was so embarrassed

1806
03:21:21,960 --> 03:21:26,120
She was so embarrassed

1807
03:21:28,680 --> 03:21:34,360
She said the guy didn't even react he didn't move he didn't even do anything. He just stood there

1808
03:21:34,680 --> 03:21:38,040
She screamed at yourself hiding in it. Oh my god

1809
03:21:39,640 --> 03:21:42,600
She said he didn't even react. He just stood there

1810
03:21:52,680 --> 03:21:54,680
Oh

1811
03:22:01,640 --> 03:22:06,520

1812
03:22:16,200 --> 03:22:18,200
And you know

You know, it's great. This is the first time this happened

1814
03:22:25,800 --> 03:22:28,200
This also happened to another sibling of mine

1815
03:22:29,560 --> 03:22:32,120
How it happened to my my sister

1816
03:22:35,880 --> 03:22:39,720
She also got stuck in the elevator, but she was by herself this time

1817
03:22:48,520 --> 03:22:50,520
And I also heard her too

1818
03:23:03,320 --> 03:23:05,320
Ah

1819
03:23:18,920 --> 03:23:20,920

03:23:40,440 --> 03:23:42,200
Wow

1823
03:23:42,200 --> 03:23:45,160
I can't say that I haven't gone through

1824
03:23:46,520 --> 03:23:53,160
I I haven't gone through what they went through being stuck in the elevator with one, but I've had a similar

1825
03:23:54,200 --> 03:23:56,200
situation

1826
03:23:57,800 --> 03:23:59,800
A similar situation

1827
03:24:00,920 --> 03:24:03,080
When I still had my my cat

1828
03:24:04,200 --> 03:24:05,240

When I saw my cat

1835
03:24:28,600 --> 03:24:31,080
He liked to hunt down bugs and stuff

1836
03:24:32,840 --> 03:24:35,240
But one day I decided to take a bath

03:28:05,400 --> 03:28:07,400
We had a

1880
03:28:07,400 --> 03:28:12,600
Cockroaches incident in a while. It's been a couple of years now. This was so long ago

1881
03:28:14,200 --> 03:28:15,880
It's a while now

1882
03:28:15,880 --> 03:28:17,880
They clean it up now

1883
03:28:17,880 --> 03:28:19,880
We haven't had an incident in a while

1884
03:28:20,840 --> 03:28:22,840
This is good

1885
03:28:27,080 --> 03:28:31,480
I don't mind the small ones the small ones are fine like I'm I'm murder those

1886
03:28:33,880 --> 03:28:37,080
Die die evens die

1887
03:28:41,560 --> 03:28:43,560
But the big ones

1888
03:28:49,880 --> 03:28:53,960
Because then what are you going to do like how are you going how you going to murder it?

1889
03:28:54,440 --> 03:28:56,440
We shoot like

1890
03:28:56,840 --> 03:28:59,000
Oh, like it's going to go crunch

1891
03:28:59,800 --> 03:29:01,800
Squelch and pop like

1892
03:29:04,360 --> 03:29:13,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1893
03:29:20,840 --> 03:29:22,840
I

1894
03:29:24,600 --> 03:29:29,560
Hate mosquitoes hate them with a burning passion. I suffer to them every day

1895
03:29:30,760 --> 03:29:36,200
But because of this fan, I haven't had a mosquito problem in a minute. Thanks

1896
03:29:37,960 --> 03:29:43,100
They they they they are annoying. I hate when they buzz in your ear

1897
03:29:50,360 --> 03:29:52,360
He

1898
03:30:00,600 --> 03:30:02,600
Hate mosquitoes

1899
03:30:04,440 --> 03:30:05,960
I like

1900
03:30:05,960 --> 03:30:11,960
Some spiders, but I'm actually really scared of spiders, but I think some of them are really cute

1901
03:30:12,520 --> 03:30:17,400
I think jumping spiders and tarantulas are the cutest things that they're so fuzzy so dangerous

1902
03:30:17,720 --> 03:30:19,720
But so fuzzy and cute

1903
03:30:21,160 --> 03:30:25,960
Look at that. So cute. I like jumping spiders. I think the big beady eyes are as little

1904
03:30:28,600 --> 03:30:30,600
Big eyes

1905
03:30:31,320 --> 03:30:33,320
They're really cute

1906
03:30:34,120 --> 03:30:36,120
But I am still scared of

1907
03:30:36,120 --> 03:30:41,320
Spiders I leave the house spiders alone. I used to have a spider friend in the corner of my room

1908
03:30:41,320 --> 03:30:43,320
But I haven't seen it in a while

1909
03:30:44,280 --> 03:30:48,520
Um, it usually like disappears for a few days and then comes back in the same corner

1910
03:30:49,000 --> 03:30:51,480
But it's been gone for like two weeks now

1911
03:30:52,840 --> 03:30:55,320
Probably moved on to new endeavors

1912
03:31:01,080 --> 03:31:05,000
But I had spider scares where a spider would appear in my showers

1913
03:31:05,960 --> 03:31:10,600
Like uh fall down. I've had a spear fear of spiders for a while

1914
03:31:13,480 --> 03:31:15,480
And

1915
03:31:34,920 --> 03:31:38,920
Yeah, I usually take them out of the house too and put them out in the window

1916
03:31:39,400 --> 03:31:41,400
Yeah, go away little spider

1917
03:31:42,360 --> 03:31:44,360
Goodbye

1918
03:31:44,760 --> 03:31:49,800
But I don't do it. I get someone else to do it because I'm not gonna do it. I'm not going nowhere near one

1919
03:31:53,240 --> 03:31:57,320
Same goes for fireflies. I'm just really I just don't I'm not a big bug person

1920
03:31:58,200 --> 03:32:00,200
I'm not a big bug person

1921
03:32:02,840 --> 03:32:10,840
Like I like fireflies they look so pretty and I'm sure they're very they're harmless, but they're terrifying

1922
03:32:12,360 --> 03:32:14,360
They move around so much

1923
03:32:35,160 --> 03:32:38,840
I think spiders are fine though. I really like snakes and all those stuff

1924
03:32:39,240 --> 03:32:41,960
But the fire is okay some of them

1925
03:32:43,240 --> 03:32:45,240
If they look scary, I don't like them

1926
03:32:45,800 --> 03:32:52,760
But if they look big like they're cute and fuzzy and stuff, then that's fine. I like those the big fuzzy big fuzzy ones

1927
03:32:54,120 --> 03:32:56,120
I think those are cute

1928
03:32:56,120 --> 03:32:58,120
You

1929
03:33:03,560 --> 03:33:08,680
Would not believe your eyes is 10 million fireflies lit up the world

1930
03:33:18,680 --> 03:33:20,680
Stare

1931
03:33:26,120 --> 03:33:28,120
I

1932
03:33:35,720 --> 03:33:43,400
Fireflies big some depends there's multiple different types of fireflies and the ones over here pretty pretty fucking big

1933
03:33:44,360 --> 03:33:47,320
But I think they're like going extinct over here

1934
03:33:48,200 --> 03:33:51,400
Haven't really had many for the last couple of years

1935
03:33:53,000 --> 03:33:55,000
Yeah, they kind of like show up and then

1936
03:33:56,120 --> 03:33:58,120
Be no more

1937
03:33:59,880 --> 03:34:01,880
There's less and less every year

1938
03:34:17,880 --> 03:34:19,880
I make my stomach hurt

1939
03:34:20,600 --> 03:34:22,600
Oh

1940
03:34:24,280 --> 03:34:28,920
Road-sized fireflies. Oh my stomach

1941
03:34:32,200 --> 03:34:34,600
No, please no, no

1942
03:34:45,400 --> 03:34:49,000
We had a nice chat today. It was a nice chatting

1943
03:34:50,200 --> 03:34:52,200
You guys are pretty chill

1944
03:35:00,040 --> 03:35:05,240
Yeah, yeah, there's a little behaved but you're good boys and girls in here

1945
03:35:05,960 --> 03:35:07,960
Ah

1946
03:35:16,200 --> 03:35:22,280
My throat is starting to hurt. I don't remember if I took my medication if I'm honest

1947
03:35:25,160 --> 03:35:32,200
I mentioned my alarm and then I mentioned my medication, but I do not remember if I took it

1948
03:35:35,400 --> 03:35:37,400
I

1949
03:35:43,000 --> 03:35:45,000
Can't take the

1950
03:35:49,960 --> 03:35:52,440
I can't take the heart medication because I did drink

1951
03:35:53,880 --> 03:35:59,400
And I'm uh, I don't want to take chances. So we're not going to take that for today. It's okay to miss a day

1952
03:36:00,360 --> 03:36:02,360
It's perfectly fine. I miss a day, but the

1953
03:36:03,480 --> 03:36:07,080
Pankillers I need it would make if I didn't take my

1954
03:36:07,800 --> 03:36:12,040
If I didn't take the painkillers, it would make sense why I have a massive like

1955
03:36:13,000 --> 03:36:15,000
The robbing like headache on a side

1956
03:36:29,880 --> 03:36:31,880
I

1957
03:36:33,560 --> 03:36:35,560
Feel like I did

1958
03:36:36,680 --> 03:36:38,680
That's a myth

1959
03:36:39,320 --> 03:36:41,320
I remember taking something

1960
03:36:42,280 --> 03:36:44,280
I remember taking something

1961
03:36:45,160 --> 03:36:47,160
I think I did

1962
03:36:48,280 --> 03:36:54,280
I think I did I did I did I 100% did I did

1963
03:37:00,120 --> 03:37:02,120
I

1964
03:37:03,960 --> 03:37:08,600
Did not take my inhaler though that I did not take that's for sure

1965
03:37:12,280 --> 03:37:15,960
I think I did take it immediately. I have my memory is just so bad

1966
03:37:30,280 --> 03:37:38,120
And I don't need to take my nasal spray today. I took it earlier in the day because I was having those problems earlier

1967
03:37:42,040 --> 03:37:45,400
That's it, you know, I think I'm good. I think it's fine. Yeah

1968
03:37:45,400 --> 03:37:47,400
Yeah

1969
03:37:53,800 --> 03:37:55,800
Hey reminds me

1970
03:37:57,720 --> 03:38:00,600

1974
03:38:20,120 --> 03:38:21,720

1975
03:38:21,720 --> 03:38:26,520
