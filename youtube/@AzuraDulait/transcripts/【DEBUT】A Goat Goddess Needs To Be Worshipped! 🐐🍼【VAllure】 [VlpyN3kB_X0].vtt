00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
You

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
You

04:00.000 --> 04:20.000
You

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
You

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
You

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
You

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
You

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
You

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
You

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
You

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
You

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
You

04:42.000 --> 04:54.000
You

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
You

04:56.000 --> 04:59.840
Among the Divines, the sister Azura would colour the land's

04:59.840 --> 05:06.000
Invertency, fill the blue oceans with life, and instill within these creations the potential

05:06.000 --> 05:09.080
to grow and repopulate.

05:09.080 --> 05:15.160
In her accomplishment, she would be known as the Goddess of Fertility.

05:15.160 --> 05:20.280
In time, Azura's creations would grow in intellect and complexity.

05:20.280 --> 05:26.280
In their scattered tribes, the gods took to guiding humanity with their superior knowledge.

05:26.280 --> 05:32.520
In this exchange, humanity gave them worship and devotion, the gods which shaped the foundations

05:32.520 --> 05:39.280
of human civilization across the lands in each celebrating their divine benefactor.

05:39.280 --> 05:45.280
The gods, confident that mankind could stand on their own, sought to create the heavens,

05:45.280 --> 05:50.040
a place where the gods could raise families of their own kind, as Earth was no space for

05:50.040 --> 05:51.540
them to grow.

05:51.540 --> 05:56.840
They rightfully seeked the same prosperity that they offered for their own and loved.

05:56.840 --> 06:02.400
Out of all the gods, it was Azura who could not leave humanity.

06:02.400 --> 06:09.200
She loved her creations, yet she also loved the gods.

06:09.200 --> 06:15.080
She left a piece of her divinity with her family in remembrance and remained on Earth

06:15.080 --> 06:22.640
to live among humanity, not as a ruler, but as a watcher and caretaker.

06:22.640 --> 06:28.680
It would be after the gods' departure that the long peace would end.

06:28.680 --> 06:33.880
With the imbalance of power, wars between the regions could not be prevented.

06:33.880 --> 06:41.000
Anger, strife, and hunger for power would taint the ego of man, and Azura's limited

06:41.000 --> 06:47.040
power could not restore the will of the gods that left behind for humanity.

06:47.040 --> 06:53.600
In her perceived failure, Azura would seemingly disappear from the walks of history.

06:53.600 --> 06:58.800
It has been long theorized that the goddess still lives amongst us in secret.

06:58.800 --> 07:04.720
There has been a long time speculation that throughout history, Azura has been guiding

07:04.720 --> 07:11.960
humanity in small leadership roles, humanitarian efforts in philanthropy, or using her power

07:11.960 --> 07:15.800
to prevent cataclysmic disasters.

07:15.800 --> 07:22.400
Wherever she is, we can all rest easy that she is watching over us from a position befitting

07:22.400 --> 07:25.040
a goddess among men.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.760
Well, Billy, I think we all learned an important lesson here today.

07:30.760 --> 07:35.240
That's right, Papa. Whatever happens, we're all family.

07:35.240 --> 07:40.080
That's exactly right, Billy, and there's nothing more important than family.

07:40.080 --> 07:44.800
Aw, Shucks, I'm so happy I have such a big, happy loving family.

07:44.800 --> 07:48.080
I'd be such a sucker if I didn't have a family.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.080
Aw, Billy.

07:55.040 --> 08:07.040
It has been a few years since I came to the realization that I could no longer outrun

08:07.040 --> 08:09.840
the reach of mankind.

08:09.840 --> 08:15.640
Living among animals, I tried to run from civilization for as long as time would allow.

08:15.640 --> 08:21.960
I am content to play the role of a commoner among humanity, yet I am tortured still by

08:21.960 --> 08:25.600
loneliness, by desires.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.000
I cannot fight my needs anymore.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.760
I must find my place among the humans and start a family.

08:34.760 --> 08:41.840
In my inaugural efforts to integrate into modern society, it became clear that I lack

08:41.840 --> 08:46.800
the necessary knowledge to fraternize as humans do.

08:46.800 --> 08:54.440
With animals, it's so simple, yet with humans, my knowledge avails me no aid.

08:54.440 --> 09:00.240
Again and again, I accumulated countless attempts at courting a suitable mate.

09:00.240 --> 09:06.560
How could I, before my goddess of fertility, struggle in his venture?

09:06.560 --> 09:11.240
Yet seeing the progress humanity has earned themselves, astonishes me.

09:11.240 --> 09:17.600
They have become creators in themselves, expanding upon the earth we had given them.

09:17.600 --> 09:23.920
The tiny seed I had planted all those eons ago, well how it blossomed.

09:23.920 --> 09:30.600
I had believed my heart broken beyond repair, but living as they do, I see now that they

09:30.600 --> 09:35.360
don't need the wills of higher beings to find their own happiness.

09:35.360 --> 09:40.280
Perhaps this in itself was the will of the gods.

09:40.280 --> 09:46.600
I see now the beauty in the human spirit, for all its ugliness and evil, but also in

09:46.600 --> 09:48.720
its kindness and community.

09:48.720 --> 09:54.240
It is the dichotomy of these aspects that makes them worthy of my love.

09:54.240 --> 09:57.400
I only regret not growing alongside them.

09:57.400 --> 10:02.560
I must make up for lost time, for every kindling of my passion.

10:02.560 --> 10:09.960
I have found I have endless love to give, and give it I shall.

10:09.960 --> 10:26.640
Any takers?

10:26.640 --> 10:30.800
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

10:30.800 --> 10:34.800
I am Azura.

10:34.800 --> 10:50.560
I bet you feel like devoting yourself to me now, don't you?

10:50.560 --> 10:57.040
Oh, you just came back from an ISE concert?

10:57.040 --> 11:02.520
Did you have fun?

11:02.520 --> 11:08.560
My eyes are up here.

11:08.560 --> 11:13.720
I suppose I don't mind you taking a peek.

11:13.720 --> 11:21.160
After all, I do have two rather big personalities, wouldn't you say?

11:21.160 --> 11:28.720
Oh, you'd make such a perfect servant for me.

11:29.720 --> 11:34.480
Aren't you convinced to serve me at just a glance?

11:34.480 --> 11:37.640
Ah, fine.

11:37.640 --> 11:42.320
If I have to convince you, then it's okay.

11:42.320 --> 11:46.480
Why don't I tell you about myself first?

11:59.720 --> 12:02.720
Wah!

12:02.720 --> 12:05.720
It's me.

12:05.720 --> 12:10.720
Hi.

12:10.720 --> 12:16.720
I hope you enjoyed the crazy concert from ISE,

12:16.720 --> 12:22.720
because now it's time to relax and vibe with me.

12:29.720 --> 12:36.720
My name is Azura Doulay, pronounced Doulay.

12:36.720 --> 12:41.720
Azura for blue and Doulay, which is French for of milk.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.720
So, blue milk.

12:44.720 --> 12:48.720
I bet you're wondering why blue.

12:48.720 --> 12:52.720
Well, because I'm blue.

12:52.720 --> 12:58.720
As for milk, I wonder.

12:58.720 --> 13:03.720
My day of creation is the 21st of August,

13:03.720 --> 13:09.720
which also happens to be National Gold Day.

13:09.720 --> 13:12.720
What are the odds?

13:15.720 --> 13:18.720
You want to know my age?

13:18.720 --> 13:23.720
Well, a goddess lives for so many human years.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.720
It's hard to keep up.

13:25.720 --> 13:29.720
I've long forgotten.

13:29.720 --> 13:36.720
Oh, you're also wondering what type of goddess I am?

13:36.720 --> 13:39.720
I am a goat goddess.

13:39.720 --> 13:43.720
And I've been around for eons.

13:43.720 --> 13:46.720
Did you know goats bring fertility to the land,

13:46.720 --> 13:51.720
and that's exactly what I did to get you here?

13:55.720 --> 14:03.720
I am also 185 centimeters, while around adorable humans like yourself.

14:03.720 --> 14:11.720
But the truth is, this isn't the biggest I can get.

14:11.720 --> 14:16.720
I can be as tall as a skyscraper.

14:16.720 --> 14:24.720
But doing that right now wouldn't be so wise.

14:24.720 --> 14:31.720
I only have English listed because that is what I mainly speak,

14:31.720 --> 14:37.720
but I am currently learning Japanese and Dutch.

14:37.720 --> 14:40.720
Who got hit all the more?

14:40.720 --> 14:48.720
Mina genki de, yate kureru toin de, takeru.

14:48.720 --> 14:55.720
Well, even goddesses have things they like and dislike.

14:55.720 --> 14:59.720
Here are mine.

14:59.720 --> 15:07.720
I love to pamper humans, which also involves nursing you,

15:07.720 --> 15:11.720
while also praising you,

15:11.720 --> 15:22.720
because I love seeing you flustered when I call you a good boy or a good girl.

15:22.720 --> 15:25.720
And did it work?

15:25.720 --> 15:32.720
You are so well-behaved, sitting through my debut.

15:32.720 --> 15:38.720
I really like getting all cuddled up nice and warm together,

15:38.720 --> 15:43.720
and foot massages too, but sometimes it tickles.

15:43.720 --> 15:47.720
So let's not get too carried away.

15:47.720 --> 15:50.720
I do love exotic pets.

15:50.720 --> 15:53.720
I think they're very cute and unique.

15:53.720 --> 16:01.720
I mean, like raccoons, ferrets, axolotls, even snakes and fuzzy spiders too.

16:01.720 --> 16:09.720
Well, I'm sure some of you are going to be very rebellious,

16:09.720 --> 16:15.720
and that's just how some humans are, but why disobey me?

16:15.720 --> 16:22.720
Wouldn't it be nice to feel my warm embrace rather than be scolded by me?

16:23.720 --> 16:31.720
And for those who do not listen, are called stinkers.

16:31.720 --> 16:38.720
So if you don't want to be one, behave.

16:38.720 --> 16:41.720
Next are pickles.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.720
They are disgusting.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.720
Only went on a burger though.

16:45.720 --> 16:49.720
I wouldn't mind sucking on them alone.

16:49.720 --> 16:59.720
But I don't think they taste great with anything else.

16:59.720 --> 17:04.720
And you see, well, I wouldn't be able to present myself in front of you

17:04.720 --> 17:12.720
without the help of some incredibly creative people.

17:13.720 --> 17:20.720
Thank you all so so much for all your hard work and dedication to our creation.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.720
Thank you, Mama.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.720
Thank you, Papa.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.720
And thank you, everyone else.

17:26.720 --> 17:32.720
I truly appreciate you.

17:32.720 --> 17:41.720
Oh, and I can't wait to tell you about my interests.

17:41.720 --> 17:47.720
I'm a huge anime fan, and I'm not picky either.

17:47.720 --> 17:54.720
I have watched over thousands of anime, love, comedy, adventure, action,

17:54.720 --> 17:59.720
and especially a good revenge story.

17:59.720 --> 18:06.720
My all-time favorite, it's Tsukumichi Moonlight Fantasy.

18:06.720 --> 18:16.720
The ancient Magus Bride, and the world god only knows.

18:16.720 --> 18:23.720
As for games, the relaxed and chill ones are my go-to most of the time,

18:23.720 --> 18:30.720
but I don't shy away from kicking some butt now and then.

18:30.720 --> 18:37.720
All my topics are Minecraft, starting Valley, and League.

18:37.720 --> 18:42.720
I mean, The Sims! The Sims!

18:42.720 --> 18:48.720
Yeah!

18:48.720 --> 18:52.720
I've also got so many great things on my mind,

18:52.720 --> 18:59.720
but here are some of my goals.

18:59.720 --> 19:04.720
I can't wait to achieve with you all.

19:04.720 --> 19:11.720
Like, reading bedtime stories so you can get the best sleep,

19:11.720 --> 19:15.720
but play all yours and my favorite games,

19:15.720 --> 19:19.720
grow a big loving community,

19:19.720 --> 19:26.720
and I absolutely can't wait to fulfill your requests for all kinds of ASMRs.

19:26.720 --> 19:34.720
For the more exclusive ASMRs, you'll find them over on the Patreon.

19:34.720 --> 19:42.720
Not to mention, I would love to collaborate with other amazing creators.

19:42.720 --> 19:47.720
Workout streams as an ASMR are something I'm very interested in,

19:47.720 --> 19:51.720
and I can't wait to try out with you all.

19:51.720 --> 19:57.720
Let's get fit together.

19:57.720 --> 20:00.720
And last but definitely not least,

20:00.720 --> 20:12.720
making so many precious memories with all of you.

20:12.720 --> 20:15.720
And here are my tags.

20:15.720 --> 20:18.720
Tags haven't been decided yet,

20:18.720 --> 20:23.720
but I was hoping that we could all come up with some,

20:23.720 --> 20:26.720
which we will do in 2.0.

20:26.720 --> 20:31.720
So far, we have, of course, our June tag indulge,

20:31.720 --> 20:34.720
our art tag Azul Arts,

20:34.720 --> 20:39.720
for all your favorite works devoted to me,

20:39.720 --> 20:43.720
and our NSW tag Azul Leagues

20:43.720 --> 20:50.720
for the more spicier works of art, or mentions.

20:50.720 --> 20:57.720
Some ideas for tags are live Azul Live,

20:57.720 --> 21:01.720
the clips Daily Delay,

21:01.720 --> 21:10.720
and the memes are Azul Meme or Delay Last.

21:10.720 --> 21:15.720
Since we are limited in time, I do hope you understand,

21:15.720 --> 21:28.720
so please help me come up with the rest in 2.0, okay?

21:28.720 --> 21:33.720
Here would be our fandom,

21:33.720 --> 21:38.720
but we have now is Bleeding Hearts.

21:38.720 --> 21:43.720
If you guys have other ideas, I'd love to hear them in 2.0.

21:43.720 --> 21:49.720
As for my Oshimarks, it is a goat emoji,

21:49.720 --> 21:53.720
because, you know, I'm the goat.

21:53.720 --> 21:57.720
The milk bottle emoji to represent you guys,

21:57.720 --> 22:01.720
my little babes.

22:01.720 --> 22:05.720
Azul, look at our mascot!

22:05.720 --> 22:07.720
Aren't they so cute?

22:07.720 --> 22:15.720
They're big ears and absorb a little face and fits you.

22:15.720 --> 22:21.720
Oh, let me tell you about my genmets.

22:21.720 --> 22:27.720
First, there is Meme, very creative.

22:27.720 --> 22:31.720
The things I've seen her do are out of this world,

22:31.720 --> 22:35.720
yet she's also a funny little oddball,

22:35.720 --> 22:38.720
and sometimes surprisingly chill.

22:38.720 --> 22:45.720
However, I'm really worried about what you'll do with that hammer.

22:45.720 --> 22:50.720
I see. I love this cute roll of love,

22:50.720 --> 22:54.720
but I swear she has a menace to food.

22:54.720 --> 23:02.720
Some of her old food combinations are insane and traumatized me.

23:02.720 --> 23:08.720
I really love her big claws, though.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.720
And she be.

23:11.720 --> 23:18.720
She's so funny and says the wildest jokes that really catch me off guard.

23:18.720 --> 23:22.720
Her extremely high energy pulls you in,

23:22.720 --> 23:27.720
and I can see her getting into trouble a lot.

23:27.720 --> 23:32.720
And she's definitely the biggest yapper.

23:32.720 --> 23:40.720
Her ears look so soft, and I want to stroke them.

23:40.720 --> 23:46.720
Then there's Mercy.

23:46.720 --> 23:50.720
She's the most adorable thing I've met.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.720
So sweet.

23:53.720 --> 23:59.720
So yummy.

23:59.720 --> 24:05.720
And last but not least, Strony.

24:05.720 --> 24:09.720
I truly hard-working fish,

24:09.720 --> 24:15.720
but I sometimes worry about how much rest she's been getting.

24:15.720 --> 24:23.720
Maybe I'll help her out and relieve some stress.

24:23.720 --> 24:28.720
I love all my gen mates very, very much.

24:28.720 --> 24:39.720
Now come, let's head over to my room.

24:39.720 --> 24:45.720
Welcome to my room.

24:45.720 --> 24:48.720
Feel free to have a look around.

24:48.720 --> 24:52.720
Isn't it spacious?

24:52.720 --> 24:57.720
As all the things I need and like.

24:57.720 --> 25:00.720
A great view from the balcony.

25:00.720 --> 25:03.720
Watch yourself up there, though.

25:03.720 --> 25:05.720
You might fall.

25:05.720 --> 25:10.720
There is a big comfy bed with lots of pillows.

25:10.720 --> 25:14.720
Good for many things, yeah?

25:14.720 --> 25:16.720
Food to snack on.

25:16.720 --> 25:22.720
And my personal favorite, a large, steaming hot bath.

25:22.720 --> 25:26.720
It's perfect for relaxing after a long day,

25:26.720 --> 25:32.720
and it has my favorite scent, lavender.

25:32.720 --> 25:37.720
Oh, me?

25:37.720 --> 25:41.720
I'm wearing only what I need to.

25:41.720 --> 25:46.720
Too many clothes, just getting the way.

25:46.720 --> 25:54.720
It might not be much, but it's made from the best material around.

25:54.720 --> 25:58.720
Of course, I like to decorate my hair.

25:58.720 --> 26:03.720
Just look.

26:03.720 --> 26:08.720
My horns are no exception.

26:08.720 --> 26:12.720
Aren't they pretty?

26:12.720 --> 26:15.720
I'm a big fan of jewels, you know.

26:15.720 --> 26:20.720
Oh, and how could I forget my rings?

26:20.720 --> 26:22.720
That's right.

26:22.720 --> 26:27.720
Toe rings.

26:27.720 --> 26:34.720
Are they just wonderful?

26:34.720 --> 26:38.720
I hope you like my looks.

26:38.720 --> 26:42.720
But that's not all.

26:42.720 --> 26:49.720
I'm very ex-brushes, goddess.

26:49.720 --> 26:54.720
You know, you'll get to see my...

26:54.720 --> 27:05.720
little face.

27:05.720 --> 27:14.720
My angry face.

27:14.720 --> 27:23.720
My dark face.

27:23.720 --> 27:32.720
When I cry.

27:32.720 --> 27:39.720
When I'm shocked.

27:39.720 --> 27:52.720
And when I sweat.

27:52.720 --> 28:01.720
My dead fish eyes.

28:01.720 --> 28:17.720
And when I'm confused.

28:17.720 --> 28:26.720
And when I'm blustered.

28:26.720 --> 28:41.720
Or how about when I'm in love.

28:41.720 --> 29:10.720
Or even wanting more.

29:10.720 --> 29:15.720
I hope all of you love...

29:15.720 --> 29:20.720
of all of you love my beautiful expressions.

29:20.720 --> 29:24.720
But one thing I never go anywhere without

29:24.720 --> 29:31.720
is some emergency milk.

29:31.720 --> 29:43.720
And some...

29:43.720 --> 29:55.720
And here is my schedule for the week.

29:55.720 --> 30:00.720
Tomorrow is debut 2.0.

30:00.720 --> 30:05.720
And I'll share some of my more interesting things with you then.

30:05.720 --> 30:09.720
Monday will play a place forbidden.

30:09.720 --> 30:16.720
And then after a day of rest, I have my very first ASMR stream for you all.

30:16.720 --> 30:21.720
Followed by one shot, some more one shot.

30:21.720 --> 30:25.720
And then some relaxing supermarket simulator

30:25.720 --> 30:43.720
where I'll sell my top tear milk.

30:43.720 --> 30:53.720
Wow, I'm getting a little sleepy.

30:53.720 --> 30:59.720
Sadly, that's all I've got time for my darlings.

30:59.720 --> 31:07.720
But if you like and subscribe, you can get a whole lot more of me very soon.

31:07.720 --> 31:09.720
The fun isn't over though.

31:09.720 --> 31:14.720
Because next we have Mercy to give you entertainment.

31:14.720 --> 31:17.720
Just watch out though.

31:17.720 --> 31:20.720
She's not as soft as me.

31:20.720 --> 31:25.720
In fact, I would describe her as very...

31:25.720 --> 31:29.720
Sharp.

31:29.720 --> 31:35.720
So please stay a while as the read-it direct will take some time.

31:35.720 --> 31:41.720
See you very soon, my lovelies.

31:41.720 --> 31:45.720
Bye bye!

32:20.720 --> 32:44.720
Thank you for watching!
