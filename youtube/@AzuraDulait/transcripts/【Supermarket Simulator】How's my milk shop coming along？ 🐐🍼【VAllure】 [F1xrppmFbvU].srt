i took like a little break in between

118
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,860
it took me like two hours to draw that

119
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000

120
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000

She's like you just have to watch me because I can't tell you.

191
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
So we can do as is watch watch her.

I'm not I don't really have much to do except for like my doctor's appointments on Mondays

195
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,720
and I kind of look forward to taking a walk outside.

196
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,720
It's like the only time I go outside.

197
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,720
This is when I go to my doctor's appointment and the weather is really nice lately.

198
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,720
The trees are growing.

199
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,720
The terriblossums bloomed for a little while and it was really pretty.

200
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
I was so pretty.

201
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
I like going outside.

202
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,720
It's really nice going on a walk feeling the nice gentle breeze on my skin.

203
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,720
As long as it's not raining, it's fine rain on a Monday kind of sucks.

204
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,720
I don't know why.

205
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,720
Did you get your glasses and must know?

206
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,720

00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,720
Today Sunday Sunday Sunday Sunday.

208
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,720
I said I'd call them to make sure that it's still there.

209
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
Oh, that reminds me.

210
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
I was literally trying.

211
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,720
Okay, so I missed a package from I missed a package from the delivery and

212
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,720
I had to call them as well today.

213
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,720
I had to call them as well today and I called them and I called.

214
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,720
They made me go on the website and they're like, oh, put in your your

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
your tracking number.

216
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
Put in a tracking number.

217
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,720
And then all that telling me that my package can't be redelivered.

218
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,720
I'm I'm so I'm getting upset.

219
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
I'm upset.

220
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
I don't want to think about that.

Thank you.

224
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,720
And then they're like, oh, then ask us where is your package?

225
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Yes, where is it?

226
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
I put it in the tracking number.

227
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,720
Oh, it's nowhere to be seen.

228
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
This does not exist.

229
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
Like what do you mean?

230
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
It doesn't exist.

231
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720

I love the rain.

237
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,720
Honestly, I love the rain.

238
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,720
But what I don't like about the rain is the location.

239
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
City rain is gross.

240
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,720

It's not clean.

246
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,720
It's been in dance in the rain, if I could.

247
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,720
But it's really gross outside.

00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:09,560
50,000 IU.

330
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:15,560
I feel like alive, right? Yeah, I'm alive. I'm okay.

331
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:22,560
I have to take one every week. One cap a week.

332
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:31,560
And I keep forgetting to take it. I suppose I took it on Friday on Friday, but I forgot.

333
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:41,560
Friday passed and I was like, did I take this? I saw it sitting behind my TV and I'm like, did I take that?

334
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,560
I'm like, no, I did not. I definitely did not.

335
00:32:47,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Yeah, every Friday I was supposed to take it. Now it's every Sunday now since I took it before I started the stream.

336
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:22,560
Is there ever a bone marrow transplant? No. I hear it hurts and I hear you have to be awake for it.

337
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,560
It sounds terrifying.

338
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,560
It sounds scary.

339
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,560
It's over 9,000 then literally.

340
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:52,560
Keep your phone always with you. My phone is always with me. It's right here.

341
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,560
It's right here. One second.

342
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,560
One second.

343
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
One second.

344
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
One second.

345
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,560
One second.

346
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,560
One second.

347
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:38,560
Yeah, that's how low. That's why you're not supposed to be in the single digits of your vitamins, especially vitamin D.

348
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:55,000
And I found out that low vitamin B count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.

349
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I found out.

350
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I didn't know that.

351
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I found out that low vitamin B count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.

352
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I found out that low vitamin B count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.

353
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I found out that low vitamin D count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.

354
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I found out that low vitamin D count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.

355
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I found out that low vitamin D count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.

356
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Help me! Help me!

357
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Help me!

358
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
My calcium levels most likely very very low.

359
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
My calcium levels most likely very low.

360
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:11,000
My calcium levels most likely very low.

361
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
My calcium levels most likely very low.

362
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
My calcium levels most likely very low.

363
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Well now you guys get to hear it though because I fixed my, I officially fixed my mic settings.

364
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I'm so happy. I think I mentioned this yesterday. I'm so happy.

365
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Every time I went high pitch my microphone went and pick it up.

366
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
But I think my microphone can now pick it up.

367
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I think I'm good. I'm good for now.

368
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:12,000
So now you can hear all my ranges because my microphone before couldn't pick up my laugh.

369
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I bet you guys still don't even really know what my real laugh is like.

370
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:31,000
My real life is my, my, my, well I mean they're all my real laughs but I guess when I really laugh really really hard it goes up really really really high.

371
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,000
If I laugh really really really hard my laugh becomes extremely high pitched.

372
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Thus my mic doesn't pick it up. Thus it sounds like I'm not responding to people but I'm busy laughing.

373
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So you can never hear it. All my previous streams whenever I laughed my microphone couldn't pick it up.

374
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
No you don't want to hear that. You don't want to hear that.

375
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
You don't want to hear that.

376
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,000
You didn't turn up great. I'm so happy. I hope my microphone sounds okay.

377
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I feel like I could do a little better. I feel like if I cut out or dip or anything just let me know.

378
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I can easily fix it. Let me know. Let me know.

379
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You want a highest note? I could say Ara Ara.

380
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And then a lowest note.

381
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You really need to hear it. My laugh.

382
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Quick so I'll make her laugh. Like a submarine radar.

383
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I wheeze when I laugh too hard. I snort when I laugh too hard.

384
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Or when something catches me off guard. I snort.

385
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It's brown and sticky.

386
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Poop. Poop. Poop is brown and sticky.

387
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Poop. Poop-o.

388
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Poop. Poop.

389
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Poop. Poop. Poop.

390
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Poop. Poop. Poop.

391
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Poop. Poop. Poop.

392
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Poop. Poop. Poop.

393
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I'm sorry. I didn't like that emo.

394
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I like the red face emo a lot.

395
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I don't know why I like trolling and then feeling as if I annoyed you so much and then this face pops up.

396
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It makes me laugh.

397
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I laugh every time I lose connection and you guys use this face.

398
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I laugh the entire time. It's so funny.

399
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
It's so hilarious.

400
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I love that face so much.

401
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I think the only time I snorted was when I tripped the robot in stray.

402
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
It's so funny.

403
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
My side hurts.

404
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I'd rather you guys show disappointment in my stupid jokes.

405
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Is that weird?

406
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Is that weird? Am I weird for that?

407
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Is that a weird thing?

408
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Is that weird?

409
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
If you guys laugh, I'm like, that wasn't funny.

410
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Why are you laughing?

411
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:42,000
But I take great pleasure when you are all disappointed in my dumb jokes.

412
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Help, I can't stop laughing.

413
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Am I an M? I don't know. I don't know. I don't think so.

414
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I don't know. Maybe to an extent.

415
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Any further than that, I'll probably get upset.

416
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I'll probably get a little ingy.

417
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I don't think I'm an M.

418
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Is it levels for you?

419
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Yeah, it's levels for me.

420
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
To a great extent.

421
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
She just likes being annoying.

422
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I do. I really do.

423
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I do like being annoying.

424
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I take great pleasure in it.

425
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Seeing the disdain on your face from my stupidity.

426
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Is that so bad?

427
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Just straight disdain.

428
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You're supposed to comfort.

429
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I do. I comfort you after I annoy you.

430
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
After I tease and annoy you, I comfort you after.

431
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Oh, was it?

432
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Glad you enjoyed it.

433
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Is that a type of aftercare?

434
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Yeah, of course.

435
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It's got the zoomies.

436
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I did drink with some soda.

437
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
So I have a lot of sugar in me right now.

438
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I just cracked my thumbs.

439
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Why did the bike fall over?

440
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
The only reason why that made me laugh

441
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
is because I fell off the bike.

442
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
The only reason why that made me laugh

443
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
is because I fell off the bike.

444
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
The only reason why that made me laugh

445
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
is because I fell off the bike.

446
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
How do you crack your thumbs?

447
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Oh, I pull them.

448
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I pull them or accidentally bend them.

449
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I bend them accidently.

450
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Like I put my hand on the table.

451
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
And if my thumb is folded in front of my palm,

452
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
like in front of the hand,

453
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
and then I put my hand down,

454
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
it cracks.

455
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I gotta do that.

456
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
This doesn't look like a supermarket.

457
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
We're getting there.

458
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
We're gonna be in the supermarket.

459
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
God, this is great, fine.

460
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Let's get on over in the supermarket.

461
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
We're gonna run out of supermarket.

462
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
God, you're so impatient.

463
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
You don't want to even want to talk to me.

464
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Whatever.

465
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Fine.

466
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
We won't.

467
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Sit and chat.

468
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
We'll go in the game.

469
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Whatever. I don't care.

470
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Whatever. I don't care.

471
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
We're gonna go.

472
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Let's go. We're gonna go into the game.

473
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
We're going in the game.

474
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Woo!

475
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Woo!

476
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Whatever. I don't care.

477
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Whatever.

478
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
We're gonna be in here.

479
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
We're gonna be in here.

480
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
We're gonna be in here.

481
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
We're gonna run out of supermarket.

482
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
We're gonna go in the game.

483
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
We're gonna be in here.

484
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Whatever.

485
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000

Hi, welcome in, welcome in. Thank you, Ran.

712
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:17,740
Really, thank you so much for the red. How was your stream? What did you play?

713
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:20,740
Welcome in.

714
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:40,740
It's very nice to meet all of you. My name is Azur Dulay. If you haven't already heard of me, I am your fertility goddess from Bialor.

715
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:44,740
Welcome in.

716
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:50,740
So if you need to go rest, rain, I appreciate it.

717
01:14:50,740 --> 01:15:04,740
I understand that if you have to rain and go, go eat, rest, drink water, eat food. Thank you so much.

718
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:10,740
It was fun. I see you're getting milk.

719
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:15,740
I'm more like selling my milk.

720
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:20,740
If you would like to purchase some, you can purchase some.

721
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:30,740
I can give you a discount.

722
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:39,740
Now water is important. Why is water important? Are you thirsty?

723
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:52,740
I give cute girl discount.

724
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:33,740
You'll get your turn chat. You'll get your turn. You'll get your little discount as well.

725
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:52,740
Eventually. What a goddess gotta do, what a goddess gotta do. Just gotta make some money.

726
01:16:52,740 --> 01:17:02,740
It's over.

727
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:10,740
$100?

728
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:24,740
He looks suspicious. I won't question anything.

729
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:36,740
$200 for $299.

730
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:45,740
Am I in it? I am.

731
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:59,740
$199.

732
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:25,740
Why does this FBI agent keep coming into my store? He's scary. He's scaring me. What does he need flour for?

733
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:30,740
He's watching me.

734
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:34,740
He took sprints out. Did you get the milk out, Leia?

735
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:37,740
I am.

736
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:47,740
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, you too. Milk and cheese, I see how it is.

737
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:58,740
Oh, it's you again. Hi.

738
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:03,740
I really like that tank top.

739
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:15,740
Oh, thank you.

740
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:25,740
Will you sell cereal too? Do you really want cereal with your milk? You want cereal, you just don't want my milk alone. Do you want cereal?

741
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:31,740
Here, I will avoid a pole.

742
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:40,740
And cereal.

743
01:19:40,740 --> 01:20:07,740
Is that it? Anyone else?

744
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:31,740
My ear is ringing. Oh my god.

745
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:42,740
cereal is called Chucky Pig.

746
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:51,740
It looks like graham crackers in the shape of a bear.

747
01:20:51,740 --> 01:21:05,740
Chocolate flavor.

748
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:13,740
Chocolate cereal with chocolate milk.

749
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:34,740
You don't have chocolate powder, but it comes from a chocolate goat.

750
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:46,740
Let me turn this off.

751
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:52,740
Is this okay? Can you hear me?

752
01:21:52,740 --> 01:22:00,740
Can you hear me?

753
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:09,740
Yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

754
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:13,740
I keep going back here.

755
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:19,740
Because you love it here, that's why. You love it here.

756
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:27,740
You love it here. You're obsessed with me.

757
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:35,740
You need me. Just like how I need you.

758
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:40,740
Yes?

759
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:48,740
Glad. Yay. Hey, can you hear me?

760
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:53,740
Let you go?

761
01:22:53,740 --> 01:23:06,740
You think I have a hold on you? I don't have to do anything. All I have to do is talk sweet nothings into your ear and you'll be back.

762
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:18,740
You'll be back.

763
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:23,740
I'll give you free reign.

764
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:38,740
All of you are already mine. You already belong to me. What do I need to fight for?

765
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:51,740
You don't want your goddess?

766
01:23:51,740 --> 01:24:00,740
Can't get over chocolate. Have you eaten cocoa puffs? I have. I'm not a big fan of cocoa puffs though.

767
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:05,740
I do like Reese's puffs.

768
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:10,740
Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs.

769
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:13,740
I've been about a chocolate famous.

770
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:23,740
Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs.

771
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:29,740
I can't watch the homies now. I keep coming back here.

772
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:34,740
I'm sure the homies will understand.

773
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:50,740
They might make fun of you and then they'll be back in here too.

774
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:57,740
Cherry goat cinnamon goat crunch.

775
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:02,740
Goat goat puffs.

776
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:07,740
I like that a lot. Someone needs to draw those.

777
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:19,740
My own personal cereal. Special cereal that you can eat with my milk.

778
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:27,740
But my favorite cereal is actually Captain Crunch.

779
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:32,740
I burnt that up last time.

780
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:39,740
It's Captain Crunch. Favorite flavor is peanut butter.

781
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:47,740
Peanut butter. Captain Crunch. It's so good. I'll eat it without milk.

782
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:56,740
Just be careful with the roof of your mouth.

783
01:25:56,740 --> 01:26:15,740
Captain Crunch will destroy it. Absolutely destroy it.

784
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:21,740
Lord in by the milk held by the siren voice.

785
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:24,740
You like it?

786
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:30,740
I mean, I can get even deeper into your ear.

787
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:35,740
I can take over your mind.

788
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:38,740
But I don't have hypnosis.

789
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:48,740
I can't do something like what the siren can do.

790
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:58,740
Hypnosis is the milk.

791
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:03,740
Who told you this?

792
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:07,740
You're not supposed to know.

793
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:15,740
Ow! My cup hit my tooth.

794
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:29,740
Now I have to eat you.

795
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:50,740
I like all of Captain Crunch cereal.

796
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:56,740
But my favorite cereal out of the Captain Crunch is probably the peanut butter.

797
01:27:56,740 --> 01:28:03,740
But I do mix it. Mix it up. Mix it up. Mix it up.

798
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:13,740
I'm so excited for more. I hope you can tell about it.

799
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:19,740
We're going to be doing... Oh, I forgot to... I completely forgot to release that.

800
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:25,740
I completely forgot. I'll do it after the stream.

801
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:30,740
I completely forgot to release my schedule.

802
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:36,740
Oopsie. You have to not cross my mind.

803
01:28:37,740 --> 01:29:03,740
I don't know what to do with you.

804
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:09,740
I don't know what to do with you.

805
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:16,740
I'm such a good streamer.

806
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:30,740
I don't know what to do with you.

807
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:35,740
I look a bit scuffed. No!

808
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:42,740
It's anything but the scuff.

809
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:46,740
Why?

810
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:52,740
I have a special ingredient to make my milk. Do you want to know what it is?

811
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:59,740
Do you want to know? Do you want to know what it is?

812
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:05,740
Yeah?

813
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:12,740
Well, I think it's love. Now it's you.

814
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:36,740
I'm back.

815
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:41,740
I'm back.

816
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:47,740
I'm back.

817
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:53,740
I'm back.

818
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:59,740
I'm back.

819
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:02,740
I'm back. All the lurkers got terrified.

820
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:08,740
All the lurkers who were not really listening.

821
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:11,740
I'm so sorry.

822
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:16,740
I'm so sorry.

823
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:42,740
I'm so sorry.

Oh, do you actually want to know an actual educational...

886
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:51,880
an actual educational thing, though?

888
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,880
Jokes aside.

889
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:09,880
Well, you see,

890
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:13,880
when women give birth, right?

891
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:17,880
And they breastfeed.

892
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:22,880
And there was a lady who...

893
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,880
who pumps her...

894
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,880
she pumps her breast milk.

895
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,880
She pumps it.

896
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:33,880
And she was really scared that it...

897
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:36,880
she was really confused of why I kept turning pink,

898
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,880
like strawberry milk.

899
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:41,880
It's actually...

900
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:44,880
we can actually produce strawberry milk.

901
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,880
It's actually possible.

902
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:49,880
The reason for that is because

903
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:53,880
a tiny bit of blood

904
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:55,880
gets into the...

905
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:57,880
into the breast milk.

906
01:37:57,880 --> 01:37:59,880
A tiny bit of blood.

907
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:01,880
So...

908
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:05,880
This is actually true.

909
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,880
This is a true fact.

910
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:09,880
Don't...

911
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:11,880
Just look it up. Google it.

912
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:13,880
Google it.

913
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:15,880
You see?

914
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:17,880
I could have been...

915
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:19,880
I could have been...

916
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,880
It's true.

917
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:31,880
That's not true, Raymond.

918
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:33,880
Like that.

919
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,880
Did it taste like strawberry, though?

920
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,880
I mean, it can.

921
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:52,880
Sometimes it tastes a little sweet.

922
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,880
Like it happens, too.

923
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:00,880
Like it's 100% happened where it tastes sweet.

924
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:03,880
After all, you are still drinking milk.

925
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,880
I think it depends on her diet.

926
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,880
On her diet as well, so...

927
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:22,880
Blood milk and strawberry milk.

928
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,880
Strawberry milk.

929
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:35,880
I see.

930
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:37,880
I see.

931
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,880
Google it. Google it.

932
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,880
It's true. It can happen.

933
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:50,880
He cursed strawberry milk.

934
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,880
Mmm.

935
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,880
Four.

936
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,880
Two.

937
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,880
You know, if it wasn't for machines...

938
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,880
I wouldn't be able to do math.

939
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:26,880
Math is hard.

940
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,880
Is it your blood?

941
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,880
Is it?

942
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,880
Is it my blood?

943
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,880
I mean, it could be.

944
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,880
But sacrifices are needed.

945
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,880
But is my blood red, though?

946
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,880
Is my blood red?

947
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:00,880
What if my blood is golden?

948
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,880
Are you sure it's my blood?

949
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:07,880
Have you ever seen a goddess bleed?

950
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:13,880
Have you ever seen a goddess bleed?

951
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:20,880
Have you ever seen a goddess bleed?

952
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,880
Tell me.

953
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,880
What if it's acidic like an alien?

954
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,880
Am I an alien?

955
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,880
Am I an alien?

956
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:46,880
Am I an alien now?

957
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:55,880
No. Give that back.

958
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:10,880
To expender. To expender.

959
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,880
To expender.

960
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,880
Is that it?

961
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,880
I was only seven?

962
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:38,880
I have cereal.

963
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:48,880
Two.

964
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:56,880
Do you think he's gonna get away with it?

965
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,880
Haha, you didn't get away with it.

966
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,880
You thought you could try to grab it before I take the prize.

967
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,880
You thought you could try to grab it before I take the prize.

968
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,880
You thought you could try to grab it before I take the prize.

969
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,880
Get off!

970
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,880
Yeah, that's right.

971
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,880
Yeah, that's right.

972
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,880
Yeah, that's right.

973
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,880
Yeah, that's right.

974
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,880
I'm gonna buy my cereal.

975
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,880
Mm-hmm.

976
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,880
Yeah.

977
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,880
They're goddess.

978
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,880
So don't be scared.

979
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,880
Don't be scared.

980
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,880
It's illial.

981
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:30,880
It's illial.

982
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:35,880
What a friend.

983
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,880
Consent is sexy.

984
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,880
Sometimes.

985
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:49,880
Very sexy.

986
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:58,880
Huh? What? What?

987
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,880
What happened? What happened?

988
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:03,880
Huh? What?

989
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:05,880
Mm-hmm.

990
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:07,880
What?

991
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:33,880
The area of cereal for the milk.

992
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:35,880
Is it healthy?

993
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:43,880
Cereal for the milk.

994
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:02,880
Mm-hmm.

995
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,880
This is no cup.

996
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,880
What do you mean?

997
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:25,880
Yes, eight dollars for the cereal.

998
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:27,880
Why? Because look.

999
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:28,880
Look, look.

1000
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:30,880
It says market price.

1001
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,880
Market price is six dollars and sixty-two cents.

1002
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:35,880
We gotta make a little more than that, you know?

1003
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:38,880
So it's wise to make it a dollar more.

1004
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,880
A dollar or two dollars more.

1005
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:43,880
I mean, we're looking at the market price.

1006
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:45,880
Fuck this price. Whatever this is.

1007
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:47,880
We're looking at this.

1008
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:51,880
This is what it sells for.

1009
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:53,880
So we do a little more than that.

1010
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:57,880
Otherwise, I'd be making no money.

1011
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:00,880
I'd be broke.

1012
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:03,880
I'm gonna be a broke-go.

1013
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:08,880
You want me to be a broke-go to you?

1014
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:11,880
I believe you're getting crazy.

1015
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:26,880
I broke God's hands from earlier.

1016
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:55,880
I...

1017
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:02,880
I...

1018
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,880
Boat for the milk.

1019
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:12,880
Milk for the cereal. The internal cycle of a syrup.

1020
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:25,880
You're mistaking market price and cost.

1021
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:27,880
We're not paying attention to this.

1022
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:29,880
This is nothing.

1023
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,880
What do you mean? Mistaking?

1024
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:35,880
They're still buying it, aren't they?

1025
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,880
Aren't they?

1026
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,880
They're still buying it.

1027
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:44,880
I see no problems here.

1028
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:47,880
They're still buying it.

1029
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:52,880
If they had a problem, they wouldn't be buying it.

1030
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,880
Are you going to the next day?

1031
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,880
Oh, right. Enter.

1032
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,880
Okay.

1033
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:25,880
So we have bread, we have milk, we have cheese.

1034
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:32,880
What else do we need?

1035
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:38,880
We need $550 to unlock.

1036
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:42,880
Oh, the special milk.

1037
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,880
Special milk.

1038
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,880
The fresher kind of milk.

1039
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,880
We need this.

1040
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,880
That one right there.

1041
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:53,880
Extremely fresh.

1042
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:55,880
Delicious.

1043
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:57,880
Delicious? Delicious.

1044
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:00,880
Delicious milk.

1045
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:03,880
Delicious.

1046
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:05,880
Delish.

1047
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:08,880
Straight from the top.

1048
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:11,880
It's the milk that you can leave on the counter.

1049
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,880
Right after.

1050
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:18,880
Purchase.

1051
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,880
We need this one.

1052
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:25,880
Do we have to buy this?

1053
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:29,880
Like in order to buy this?

1054
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:31,880
Do we have to buy this?

1055
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:37,880
What else do we need?

1056
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:39,880
Salt and rice.

1057
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:41,880
Oh, I like rice though.

1058
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:45,880
We don't need all of these.

1059
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:47,880
We don't need any of these.

1060
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:53,880
We don't need the salt, peanut butter, flour, olive oils, pasta, rice and salt.

1061
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:55,880
What we need is milk.

1062
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:57,880
We need more milk.

1063
01:50:57,880 --> 01:50:59,880
We want this right there.

1064
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:01,880
We want milk and we want yogurt.

1065
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:03,880
More cereal.

1066
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:05,880
Milk, yogurt.

1067
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:07,880
Oh, cakes.

1068
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:09,880
Cakes.

1069
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,880
Yeah, there's different levels to milk.

1070
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:13,880
There's processed milk.

1071
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:15,880
Like after they take the milk from me.

1072
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:41,880
I got you little lambs.

1073
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:47,880
Little lambs.

1074
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:49,880
Thank you so much for the $1.

1075
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:51,880
To be miss Morgan.

1076
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:53,880

1077
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:57,880

Oh, watching you all pull this so cute.

1083
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:35,880
My little lambs.

1084
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:43,880
The hallucinogens you put in the milk is working mama.

1085
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:45,880
Now we just got to sacrifice them.

1086
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:47,880
Smiley face.

1087
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:49,880
Sacrifice.

1088
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:51,880

Sacrifice.

1090
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:55,880
Sacrifice.

1091
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:57,880
Thanks for the $3.

1092
01:52:57,880 --> 01:52:59,880
To be miss Misaka.

1093
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:01,880
Misaka.

1094

Are you sure about that?

You won't melt, you won't melt.

1244
02:13:34,900 --> 02:13:39,900
Just a little, you refuse to fold, huh?

1245

I see, I see.

1246
02:13:46,900 --> 02:13:57,900
A little baby boy scared, scared to accept your fate.

1247
02:13:57,900 --> 02:14:14,900
Your loyalty should not bound, you cannot escape this goddess.

1248
02:14:14,900 --> 02:14:20,900
Are you sure you want someone as useless as you?

1249
02:14:20,900 --> 02:14:32,900
Your uselessness means nothing, because you are already of use to me, as long as I have your heart.

1250
02:14:32,900 --> 02:14:49,900
Everything I ever wanted, each and every one of you.

1251
02:14:49,900 --> 02:15:01,900
A piece for the phabias.

1252
02:15:01,900 --> 02:15:16,900
I can't give you all a piece, did you forget that I can get really, really big?

1253
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:24,900
The bigger I can get, the more of you I can hold.

1254
02:15:31,900 --> 02:16:00,900
Ah, so cute.

1255
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:29,900
You are all my precious little babies.

1256
02:16:29,900 --> 02:16:33,900
And nothing can take that away.

1257
02:16:33,900 --> 02:16:46,900
The only one that gets in your way is yourself, and all you have to do is let it go and accept your fate.

1258
02:17:00,900 --> 02:17:07,900
What are you scared of?

1259
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:09,900
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1260
02:17:09,900 --> 02:17:16,900
Mommy's here, mommy's got you, mommy's going to hold you.

1261
02:17:29,900 --> 02:17:52,900
Yes, yes, I'll piece for the phabias.

1262
02:17:52,900 --> 02:18:13,900
Melgue's for the phabias.

1263
02:18:13,900 --> 02:18:32,900
Arra, ara.

1264
02:18:32,900 --> 02:18:35,900
Your soothing voice helps me keep going.

1265
02:18:35,900 --> 02:18:40,900
You are the sweetest woman in your generation and a blessing for a man's mental health.

1266
02:18:40,900 --> 02:18:43,900
Thank you Azura.

1267
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:52,900
Wow, it's so sweet of you to say anonymous. Thank you for the $1 to happy. Thank you.

1268
02:18:52,900 --> 02:19:21,900
So sweet.

1269
02:19:21,900 --> 02:19:36,900
Oh, I have to sneeze.

1270
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:42,900
Oh my gosh, my eyes are watery.

1271
02:19:43,900 --> 02:19:47,900
Don't die, don't die.

1272
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:52,900
Thank you for the $3 to happy.

1273
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:57,900
Thank you, thank you.

1274
02:19:57,900 --> 02:20:02,900
Don't die, you must live, you must survive.

1275
02:20:02,900 --> 02:20:06,900
I'm a survivor, I wanna make it.

1276
02:20:06,900 --> 02:20:22,900
I'm a survivor, keep on surviving.

1277
02:20:22,900 --> 02:20:39,900
Thank you for the blessures.

1278
02:20:39,900 --> 02:21:07,900
Is that Leopold?

1279
02:21:08,900 --> 02:21:17,900
I want to keep listening to you, but I need to go to sleep for work tomorrow. So conflicting. May I get a hug and kiss goodnight mommy?

1280
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:35,900
Thank you so much for the $1 to happy. I'm the late lover. Here's your hug.

1281
02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:54,900
Good night.

1282
02:21:54,900 --> 02:22:05,900
Do I kill you guys? Chat time.

1283
02:22:05,900 --> 02:22:14,900
They're dead, they're dead.

1284
02:22:24,900 --> 02:22:47,900
Thank you for the $1 to happy.

1285
02:22:47,900 --> 02:23:06,900
It was my mouth, but I stood tall. I can wonder what other things are standing tall.

1286
02:23:06,900 --> 02:23:34,900
Thank you for the $1 to happy.

1287
02:23:34,900 --> 02:23:45,900
Thank you for the $1 to happy.

1288
02:23:45,900 --> 02:24:08,900
Oh that's so bright, oh my eyeballs.

1289
02:24:08,900 --> 02:24:18,900
Okay, I wanna see if I can buy that thing now or buy any level 9.

1290
02:24:38,900 --> 02:24:57,900
I don't trust it. I feel like I'm playing Pokemon all over again. You know, when the game crashes, so you're so scared of your process being lost and when you play Pokemon on the DS, so you save it every 2 minutes.

1291
02:24:57,900 --> 02:25:16,900
That's what I feel like right now.

1292
02:25:16,900 --> 02:25:35,900
Because there's no warning when it crashes or anything, it just closes the game. That's it, just close. I've boop, gone.

1293
02:25:35,900 --> 02:25:52,900
Better channel doesn't have our ASMRs. Well, yeah, it's unfortunate. I only had one ASMR though. I believe next week I'll be having another ASMR, but I think it's gonna be called ASMR.

1294
02:25:52,900 --> 02:26:04,900
If you understand my grip, we gotta be more safe with the thickness that we do on here.

1295
02:26:04,900 --> 02:26:20,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, see, yeah, see, yeah.

1296
02:26:34,900 --> 02:27:00,900
Oh, she scared me. She scared me so bad. I don't think anyone else is gonna come in here. Yeah, she, yeah.

1297
02:27:00,900 --> 02:27:22,900
Big toe.

1298
02:27:22,900 --> 02:27:35,900
Anyone else? Nobody else? Anybody else wanna come in here? Anybody else? Nobody else? Ah, see? Alright, I see all this.

1299
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:52,900
And I closed door. Yay! And now it saves, right? I don't see it.

1300
02:27:52,900 --> 02:28:11,900
We're like barely making any money with our milk.

1301
02:28:11,900 --> 02:28:30,900
It stays.

1302
02:28:30,900 --> 02:28:59,900
I hear. Oh. Since whole yapping. This goat mafia you see. I'm hungry. I wanna eat. I wanna eat food.

1303
02:29:00,900 --> 02:29:24,900
Yeah, no more cookie eating for the ASMR.

1304
02:29:24,900 --> 02:29:53,900
Nope. No toast today. Instead, I'm going to eat weyanya. Weyanya. I'm going to eat weyanya.

1305
02:29:54,900 --> 02:30:10,900
Weyanya. Weyanya.

1306
02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:34,900
FBI agents coming to have a taste of my milk. It's definitely chocolate.

1307
02:30:35,900 --> 02:30:51,900
Why are there so many FBI agents in here?

1308
02:30:51,900 --> 02:31:10,900
I hear the rumors about your strawberry milk. Hey.

1309
02:31:10,900 --> 02:31:27,900
We just use a little bit of powder. A little bit of powder, you know?

1310
02:31:40,900 --> 02:32:09,900
Can I hire someone to register? Is that possible? Oh, hiring.

1311
02:32:10,900 --> 02:32:27,900
Aww. No, good to see you.

1312
02:32:40,900 --> 02:33:09,900
How about we make this the last night and then we just sit and chat? Sit and chat. Sit and chat for a little bit.

1313
02:33:10,900 --> 02:33:29,900
But I do want to eat.

1314
02:33:40,900 --> 02:34:09,900
Oh, we already had a bread in cereal.

1315
02:34:40,900 --> 02:35:09,900
Mmm. I'll take the goat milk entire stock and production and factory all together. It'll cost you.

1316
02:35:10,900 --> 02:35:23,900
I don't think you'd have enough to sacrifice to own all of it, now would you? It might cost you more than an arm and a leg.

1317
02:35:23,900 --> 02:35:52,900
Maybe your entire heart?

1318
02:35:53,900 --> 02:36:19,900
How's the stream going? Really well. I'm enjoying myself. Very much so. Oh, thank God that was empty. Oh, my goodness.

1319
02:36:19,900 --> 02:36:32,900
Oh, my goodness. Thank goodness that cup was empty.

1320
02:36:32,900 --> 02:36:47,900
That was close. Anyone else? Anybody else?

1321
02:36:47,900 --> 02:37:08,900
I'm going to save it for the next day. Save it just in case.

1322
02:37:17,900 --> 02:37:36,900
I hear.

1323
02:37:36,900 --> 02:37:59,900
Where's your timer for the mess?

1324
02:37:59,900 --> 02:38:14,900
Do you think goat mom could crush chat if she wanted to? Yes, she can.

1325
02:38:15,900 --> 02:38:25,900
And you'd perish. But would I? No, I wouldn't do that. Why?

1326
02:38:25,900 --> 02:38:40,900
Because I need you. I need you. Just like how you need me. I need you.

1327
02:38:40,900 --> 02:38:55,900
Well, it's with little babies. How else am I supposed to breed?

1328
02:39:10,900 --> 02:39:39,900
How are the tables turned?

1329
02:39:39,900 --> 02:39:46,900
What do you mean?

1330
02:39:46,900 --> 02:39:53,900
Alright, let me grab me my food and I'll be right back.

1331
02:39:53,900 --> 02:40:01,900
Play some sports with each other while I go be right back. Alright, I'm gonna be right back.

1332
02:40:01,900 --> 02:40:08,900
I have this pretty screen.

1333
02:41:31,900 --> 02:41:46,900
I have this pretty screen.

1334
02:41:46,900 --> 02:42:01,900
I have this pretty screen.

1335
02:42:01,900 --> 02:42:16,900
I have this pretty screen.

1336
02:42:16,900 --> 02:42:31,900
I have this pretty screen.

1337
02:42:31,900 --> 02:42:46,900
I have this pretty screen.

1338
02:42:46,900 --> 02:43:10,900
I have this pretty screen.

1339
02:43:10,900 --> 02:43:28,900
I'm looking at all of you playing all sports.

1340
02:43:29,900 --> 02:43:37,900
I'm back.

1341
02:43:37,900 --> 02:43:43,900
I have lasagna.

1342
02:43:58,900 --> 02:44:19,900
I'm very good. I'm proud of you.

1343
02:44:19,900 --> 02:44:29,900
Are you guys eating? I hope you all are eating.

1344
02:44:29,900 --> 02:44:39,900
If you can't eat right now, I'll help you eat later.

1345
02:44:39,900 --> 02:44:52,900
I need drinks. I still have the soda left over.

1346
02:44:52,900 --> 02:45:03,900
Am I peaking?

1347
02:45:03,900 --> 02:45:11,900
Is that better? Oh no. That's not what happened.

1348
02:45:11,900 --> 02:45:38,900
That's not what happened at all. I know why I'm peaking. Every time I move my keyboard and my keyboard accidentally hits one of my equipment and turns the knob up or down.

1349
02:45:38,900 --> 02:45:49,900
Oh my god, it was at 80. I am so sorry.

1350
02:45:49,900 --> 02:45:56,900
Oh my god.

1351
02:45:56,900 --> 02:46:07,900
My keyboard keeps hitting the knob and turns it up and I have to keep looking out for that. I moved my keyboard out of the way so I could put my plate down.

1352
02:46:07,900 --> 02:46:22,900
Is that better? I'm so sorry about that.

1353
02:46:22,900 --> 02:46:28,900
It scared me.

1354
02:46:28,900 --> 02:46:35,900
It's fine. My ears are yours. I don't want your ears to be destroyed.

1355
02:46:35,900 --> 02:46:51,900
If your ears get destroyed, how else are you going to listen to me? You'll be sad. You won't be able to hear my voice anymore.

1356
02:46:51,900 --> 02:46:57,900
You'll go crazy. You'll lose your mind.

1357
02:46:57,900 --> 02:47:08,900
Do you know how? Because you already got a taste of what my voice already sounds like. You like my voice. You love it. You will be hearing it.

1358
02:47:08,900 --> 02:47:22,900
You wait for my streams. Even when I'm gone, you think about my voice. When I stream, you're happy. You like my voice. My voice is there. It's in your ears. You want to hear more.

1359
02:47:22,900 --> 02:47:35,900
One day, you lose your hearing. You can't hear anymore. You can't hear. But you want to hear my voice. But you can't hear.

1360
02:47:35,900 --> 02:47:52,900
Now you have the thought of what you used to know. All you can do is remember the voice in your head. My voice in your head. You think about it. About what you could do to hear my voice again.

1361
02:47:52,900 --> 02:48:02,900
You do anything. Anything. You want to hear my voice. You want to hear my voice. You're losing your mind.

1362
02:48:02,900 --> 02:48:27,900
You need to hear my voice. You have to hear my voice. Days go by. You're starting to forget. You're starting to forget. What my voice sounds like. You're gonna forget. You don't want to forget. You want to hear my voice. You want to hear my voice. You're losing your mind. You're going crazy. You want to hear my voice.

1363
02:48:32,900 --> 02:48:42,900
Is that what you want to do? Is that what you want to go through?

1364
02:49:02,900 --> 02:49:20,900
If you don't want that, take care of your ears. Tell me if my volume peaks. Tell me if it goes low. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience.

1365
02:49:32,900 --> 02:49:33,900
If you don't want that, take care of your ears. Tell me if it goes low. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's

1366
02:50:02,900 --> 02:50:16,580
the horror you want to experience.

1367
02:50:16,580 --> 02:50:18,580
There you go.

1368
02:50:24,180 --> 02:50:27,220
Help I'm a rock. Help I'm a rock.

1369
02:50:46,580 --> 02:50:50,420
I'm already kind of deaf in one ear.

1370
02:50:53,300 --> 02:51:00,420
That's all right. You have another ear. Another ear you'll need to take care of.

1371
02:51:16,580 --> 02:51:32,580
I'll do my best to let you know. Careful eating mama. Clearly that is just way too up.

1372
02:51:36,580 --> 02:51:38,580
I'll be careful.

1373
02:51:38,580 --> 02:51:48,580
I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube.

1374
02:52:08,580 --> 02:52:28,580
Did I post it yet? No I didn't post it yet. Excuse me. I can post it right now. Give me one second. I have to find it though.

1375
02:52:38,580 --> 02:52:44,580
One second please.

1376
02:53:08,580 --> 02:53:16,580
I sneezed. Thank you.

1377
02:53:38,580 --> 02:53:58,580
Let me grab this. My brain isn't braining right now.

1378
02:53:58,580 --> 02:54:14,580
My brain is kind of trying to remember where I put it but it's only in one place and I don't know why I can't remember that place.

1379
02:54:28,580 --> 02:54:38,580
I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube.

1380
02:54:58,580 --> 02:55:08,580
I'm in love with YouTube.

1381
02:55:28,580 --> 02:55:38,580
I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube.

1382
02:55:58,580 --> 02:56:08,580
I'm in love with YouTube.

1383
02:56:28,580 --> 02:56:46,580
I did it. Yay.

1384
02:56:46,580 --> 02:56:56,580
Do you want some Messiah? Open it up.

1385
02:57:16,580 --> 02:57:32,580
I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube.

1386
02:57:32,580 --> 02:58:00,580
Come on. You'd like it. You love it.

1387
02:58:02,580 --> 02:58:22,580
You'd eat it.

1388
02:58:22,580 --> 02:58:42,580
I'm a good girl. I'm the best girl.

1389
02:58:52,580 --> 02:59:20,580
I'm a good girl.

1390
02:59:22,580 --> 02:59:32,580
I'm a good girl. I'm a good girl.

1391
02:59:52,580 --> 03:00:02,580
Oh God.

1392
03:00:02,580 --> 03:00:12,580
I have a little square left. I've got to gather all of the crumbs together.

1393
03:00:12,580 --> 03:00:20,580
The last bite. The last bite.

1394
03:00:20,580 --> 03:00:36,580
It's pretty full of crumbs together.

1395
03:00:36,580 --> 03:00:46,580
Yeah.

1396
03:00:46,580 --> 03:00:58,580
Mmm.

1397
03:00:58,580 --> 03:01:08,580
What kind of lasagna was it?

1398
03:01:08,580 --> 03:01:14,580
Beef? Beef lasagna?

1399
03:01:14,580 --> 03:01:24,580
I don't know. It's homemade lasagna. I don't know.

1400
03:01:24,580 --> 03:01:44,580
I don't know about other kinds of lasagna.

1401
03:01:44,580 --> 03:01:48,580
I don't know. She's going to move on to us next.

1402
03:01:48,580 --> 03:01:56,580
Maybe.

1403
03:01:56,580 --> 03:02:08,580
Beef lasagna.

1404
03:02:08,580 --> 03:02:14,580
Move. Move. Move.

1405
03:02:14,580 --> 03:02:40,580
Move. Move.

1406
03:02:40,580 --> 03:02:50,580
How? How to do cow noise?

1407
03:02:50,580 --> 03:03:18,580
How is it?

1408
03:03:18,580 --> 03:03:24,580
I have really good at doing animal impressions. I never mentioned that in my debut.

1409
03:03:24,580 --> 03:03:34,580
Because that was embarrassed. I'm sorry.

1410
03:03:34,580 --> 03:04:02,580
But I get really loud when I do it.

1411
03:04:02,580 --> 03:04:08,580
I don't know how to whisper to it. It's not possible.

1412
03:04:08,580 --> 03:04:14,580
So just then that was probably extremely loud.

1413
03:04:14,580 --> 03:04:20,580
I probably woke up someone.

1414
03:04:20,580 --> 03:04:30,580
I don't know how to whisper. I have to use my entire vocal box to be able to do it.

1415
03:04:30,580 --> 03:04:58,580
For a girl, you're especially good at sounding like a cow.

1416
03:04:58,580 --> 03:05:16,580
How are you?

1417
03:05:16,580 --> 03:05:22,580
I'm too embarrassed to do any other sounds.

1418
03:05:22,580 --> 03:05:28,580
I'm so flustered. My face is burning. Oh my gosh.

1419
03:05:28,580 --> 03:05:34,580
I could do a duck. I could do a duck.

1420
03:05:34,580 --> 03:05:44,580
I could do chicken. I could do small birds.

1421
03:05:44,580 --> 03:05:54,580
I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it.

1422
03:05:54,580 --> 03:06:02,580
I didn't mention any of my impressions on debut because I knew I was going to get too embarrassed to do it.

1423
03:06:02,580 --> 03:06:06,580
Then I was going to do it and I was going to mess up on doing it.

1424
03:06:06,580 --> 03:06:12,580
Then I was going to be so embarrassed that I would want to perish.

1425
03:06:12,580 --> 03:06:24,580
I didn't add it at all.

1426
03:06:24,580 --> 03:06:36,580
Oh shit.

1427
03:06:36,580 --> 03:06:50,580
We're too loud. We're too loud. We're too loud.

1428
03:06:50,580 --> 03:06:58,580
Trying to do it and whisper is so hard.

1429
03:06:58,580 --> 03:07:10,580
It's so hard. How do you whisper and make noises?

1430
03:07:10,580 --> 03:07:20,580
Why? Don't tell him.

1431
03:07:20,580 --> 03:07:38,580
Don't tell him.

1432
03:07:38,580 --> 03:07:52,580
I can't do the rooster noise. The one that wakes you up in the morning because it's way too loud.

1433
03:07:52,580 --> 03:08:00,580
There's a quiet one. There you go.

1434
03:08:00,580 --> 03:08:08,580
How do you whisper? It's so hard.

1435
03:08:22,580 --> 03:08:32,580
No.

1436
03:08:32,580 --> 03:08:42,580
What a cute poem.

1437
03:08:42,580 --> 03:09:04,580
Look at that.

1438
03:09:04,580 --> 03:09:16,580
That one hurts.

1439
03:09:16,580 --> 03:09:36,580
I'm a kitty.

1440
03:09:36,580 --> 03:09:58,580
I'm a kitty.

1441
03:09:58,580 --> 03:10:24,580
We used to yell at each other all the time.

1442
03:10:24,580 --> 03:10:28,580
I miss him so much.

1443
03:10:28,580 --> 03:10:46,580
We just go back and forth doing that to each other.

1444
03:10:46,580 --> 03:11:06,580
I miss him so much.

1445
03:11:06,580 --> 03:11:32,580
Hello. Hi.

1446
03:11:32,580 --> 03:11:44,580
I didn't voice-act the cat and stray. The cat and stray is actually voice-acted and modeled after an actual cat.

1447
03:11:44,580 --> 03:11:58,580
And he is a cutie. Such a cutie. Did you see him?

1448
03:11:58,580 --> 03:12:18,580
I can never take the job of a real cat.

1449
03:12:18,580 --> 03:12:34,580
I was meat stuck in my teeth.

1450
03:12:34,580 --> 03:12:44,580
Did they hire cat voice actor? Not a real person but an actual cat.

1451
03:12:44,580 --> 03:12:50,580
Thanks we got a real cat and let him meow into a microphone.

1452
03:12:50,580 --> 03:12:58,580
I think it's the same cat that we also put the tape and stuff over.

1453
03:12:58,580 --> 03:13:04,580
And the cat walked around with the stuff all over it.

1454
03:13:04,580 --> 03:13:08,580
I liked the behind the scene video. It was very cute.

1455
03:13:08,580 --> 03:13:30,580
Have you guys seen the video of the cat doing the stuff for the game?

1456
03:13:30,580 --> 03:13:56,580
It's an actual kitty cat.

1457
03:13:56,580 --> 03:14:04,580
Sorry to serve. I'll show you.

1458
03:14:04,580 --> 03:14:14,580
Hi.

1459
03:14:34,580 --> 03:14:46,580
Oops.

1460
03:14:46,580 --> 03:14:58,580
Ignore that.

1461
03:14:58,580 --> 03:15:26,580
Yeah but how do I make it?

1462
03:15:26,580 --> 03:15:42,580
Is it lost? Work for me.

1463
03:15:42,580 --> 03:15:58,580
I can't do that. It's so dumb.

1464
03:15:58,580 --> 03:16:08,580
Close.

1465
03:16:08,580 --> 03:16:22,580
Again you are going to fight over us.

1466
03:16:22,580 --> 03:16:26,580
It's not what I want to move. It's not what I moved.

1467
03:16:26,580 --> 03:16:32,580
Work with me. Work with me.

1468
03:16:32,580 --> 03:16:38,580
Do you literally have the thingy up? It's not working.

1469
03:16:38,580 --> 03:16:44,580
I changed it. Why is it not working? What happened?

1470
03:16:44,580 --> 03:16:52,580
What the heck? What's happening? What can I...

1471
03:16:52,580 --> 03:17:02,580
No.

1472
03:17:02,580 --> 03:17:08,580
I did it. I'm so smart.

1473
03:17:08,580 --> 03:17:18,580
Let's go. I'm intelligent.

1474
03:17:18,580 --> 03:17:26,580
I'm so smart. Oh my god. You believe it how smart I am?

1475
03:17:26,580 --> 03:17:34,580
I'm so smart. Is this too small? Should I make it bigger?

1476
03:17:34,580 --> 03:17:42,580
Is this too small?

1477
03:17:42,580 --> 03:17:50,580
This is a kitty cat.

1478
03:17:50,580 --> 03:17:54,580
This is a cat that they have for the thingy. I don't even think you can hear it.

1479
03:17:54,580 --> 03:18:06,580
Hang on.

1480
03:18:06,580 --> 03:18:18,580
You can't hear it. I can't hear it.

1481
03:18:18,580 --> 03:18:24,580
Sorry. I heard myself. My apologies.

1482
03:18:24,580 --> 03:18:38,580
Ew. I heard myself.

1483
03:18:38,580 --> 03:18:44,580
How do I move it?

1484
03:18:44,580 --> 03:18:46,580
Can you hear it now?

1485
03:19:14,580 --> 03:19:40,580
Now there. I went through all that for a really short video.

1486
03:19:40,580 --> 03:20:02,580
Today we are group.

1487
03:20:02,580 --> 03:20:10,580
I can't really watch it alone.

1488
03:20:10,580 --> 03:20:26,580
I'd watch memes and videos with you guys.

1489
03:20:26,580 --> 03:20:48,580
I can't hear it.

1490
03:20:48,580 --> 03:20:58,580
The fat cat. Big chunkers.

1491
03:20:58,580 --> 03:21:06,580
Where the cats paid? I think the owners were paid.

1492
03:21:06,580 --> 03:21:16,580
I think the owners got paid for their kitty cat audition.

1493
03:21:16,580 --> 03:21:36,580
Maybe we can add that to a dono.

1494
03:21:36,580 --> 03:21:40,580
Where you guys submit your funniest memes to me.

1495
03:21:40,580 --> 03:21:52,580
I'll have someone go through them before sending them to me.

1496
03:21:52,580 --> 03:22:00,580
Just in case you guys send me something out of this world.

1497
03:22:00,580 --> 03:22:10,580
I don't trust you to be good but I don't trust all of you.

1498
03:22:10,580 --> 03:22:32,580
I don't trust you to be good but I don't trust all of you.

1499
03:22:32,580 --> 03:22:44,580
If I don't laugh at your memes don't take it the hard way right?

1500
03:22:44,580 --> 03:22:50,580
There's only so many things that can really make me laugh and my humor is kind of lost.

1501
03:22:50,580 --> 03:23:00,580
I laugh at the dumbest things and I really like people falling.

1502
03:23:00,580 --> 03:23:10,580
I don't know it's hard to explain. It's like a specific kind of funny.

1503
03:23:10,580 --> 03:23:16,580
It's like people get caught doing something they're not supposed to.

1504
03:23:16,580 --> 03:23:34,580
Other people laughing about it.

1505
03:23:34,580 --> 03:23:38,580
Caught lacking not me.

1506
03:23:38,580 --> 03:23:48,580
As long as they don't get seriously hurt is this fine with me.

1507
03:23:48,580 --> 03:23:58,580
As long as someone gets horrendously hurt or really badly hurt.

1508
03:23:58,580 --> 03:24:08,580
Make me go oof.

1509
03:24:08,580 --> 03:24:11,580
But every now and then it's fine.

1510
03:24:11,580 --> 03:24:14,580
You know how when you're like scrolling memes.

1511
03:24:14,580 --> 03:24:20,580
Scrolling the memes and you're scrolling and scrolling.

1512
03:24:20,580 --> 03:24:30,580
Ha ha hee hee every now and then and then you get hit with a random fall meme.

1513
03:24:30,580 --> 03:24:40,580
It gives you a good laugh.

1514
03:24:40,580 --> 03:24:43,580
Do you want to scroll through my tiktok?

1515
03:24:43,580 --> 03:24:52,580
Well if we scroll through tiktok it will be on the new account which I haven't really been on.

1516
03:24:52,580 --> 03:25:03,580

1517
03:25:03,580 --> 03:25:10,580

1519
03:25:13,580 --> 03:25:21,580

03:44:19,800 --> 03:44:26,800
Never. Never. Never.

1668
03:44:26,800 --> 03:44:32,800
It won't leave again, right?

1669
03:44:32,800 --> 03:44:37,800
If I do leave, right?

1670
03:44:37,800 --> 03:44:45,800
It is only going to be for a little while. Only for a short while, yeah?

1671
03:44:46,800 --> 03:44:53,800
It's just a short while, and you guys can wait for me, right?

1672
03:44:53,800 --> 03:44:58,800
Mommy has to go every now and then.

1673
03:45:03,800 --> 03:45:07,800
Mommy has to.

1674
03:45:08,800 --> 03:45:17,800
Mommy is going to be gone for the next two days, and she'll be back. Don't worry.

1675
03:45:17,800 --> 03:45:22,800
Mommy will be back on Wednesday.

1676
03:45:22,800 --> 03:45:27,800
On Wednesday, you guys can wait till then, yes?

1677
03:45:38,800 --> 03:45:43,800
No.

1678
03:45:58,800 --> 03:46:05,800
Today is a period. There is no misery. You guys will be fine.

1679
03:46:05,800 --> 03:46:16,800
I am not abandoning you. Azra has things to do on those two days. Mondays and Tuesdays are very busy days for me.

1680
03:46:19,800 --> 03:46:26,800
Very busy days, and then you have me Wednesday all the way to Sunday.

1681
03:46:26,800 --> 03:46:32,800
So many things planned for you guys. So many things.

1682
03:46:35,800 --> 03:46:45,800
You're not getting abandoned. No one is getting abandoned.

1683
03:46:45,800 --> 03:46:54,800
Mommy is taking care of her health for you. If mommy doesn't take care of her health, there will be no mommy.

1684
03:46:54,800 --> 03:47:02,800
If mommy doesn't take care of her health, there will be no mommy.

1685
03:47:25,800 --> 03:47:30,800
Mommy is crying.

1686
03:47:31,800 --> 03:47:36,800
Mommy is crying.

1687
03:47:43,800 --> 03:47:50,800
In the meantime, while you all wait for me to come back, you can send me sweet, sweet morals.

1688
03:47:50,800 --> 03:48:03,800
You can send me morals, sweet messages, like there's letters to me, and I'll read them, and I'll go over them, and I'll heart them, so I know that I read them.

1689
03:48:07,800 --> 03:48:14,800
Okay, send me morals. That's fine. I'll take your morals.

1690
03:48:15,800 --> 03:48:24,800
I'm not really bothered by all the other morals. I just wanted to talk about it a little bit, that it was silly. That's all.

1691
03:48:28,800 --> 03:48:32,800
And I'll be the last time I talk about those morals, alright?

1692
03:48:35,800 --> 03:48:37,800
That is the last.

1693
03:48:38,800 --> 03:48:56,800
But other than that, I have received so many kind morals from so many of you already, and I feel so bad that I haven't responded to some of them, but I have given a lot of hearts to them.

1694
03:48:56,800 --> 03:49:01,800
I think I was told that you guys can still see when I heart a moral.

1695
03:49:08,800 --> 03:49:10,800
I think.

1696
03:49:26,800 --> 03:49:31,800
So, send me your sweet words, and I'll listen to them. I'll read them.

1697
03:49:32,800 --> 03:49:40,800
I started responding to really old morals that I didn't respond to like 14 days ago.

1698
03:49:41,800 --> 03:49:49,800
I think I'm now in the 12 days ago ones, so it's taking me time, but I'll get through it.

1699
03:49:50,800 --> 03:49:52,800
I'm so sorry.

1700
03:50:02,800 --> 03:50:13,800
Yeah, so, you can like literally see, I think, a few morals that I made public, I think.

1701
03:50:14,800 --> 03:50:26,800
If you like scroll down the moral page, you can like scroll down. You can see the ones I have publicly responded to, so that you guys do not ask me the same questions over and over again.

1702
03:50:26,800 --> 03:50:44,800
I'm sorry if I don't answer some questions, but I get asked some questions like 20 times already and counting, so I just give it a heart and then I go past it.

1703
03:50:44,800 --> 03:50:55,800
It's been 84 years.

1704
03:50:59,800 --> 03:51:02,800
Read material as not to miss you.

1705
03:51:03,800 --> 03:51:12,800
If you guys haven't seen some of my vans or my past dreams, you can go take a look at those.

1706
03:51:13,800 --> 03:51:18,800
There's also the Patreon. You can visit the Patreon.

1707
03:51:20,800 --> 03:51:22,800
You can go in there.

1708
03:51:23,800 --> 03:51:30,800
There's also like in the future there will be other videos. There's as more download on the Twitter if you couldn't find that.

1709
03:51:31,800 --> 03:51:39,800
There's that. There's also my art that I do on the old. There's so much material already out and ready for you.

1710
03:51:40,800 --> 03:51:47,800
So if you really want to get that material, you know where to visit. Just check out in the description below.

1711
03:51:49,800 --> 03:51:55,800
It's not the same. How is it not the same? It's me. It's all me.

1712
03:52:00,800 --> 03:52:09,800
You can also buy my merch, buy the merch, and you can literally have me closer to your heart than ever before.

1713
03:52:30,800 --> 03:52:45,800
It's inevitable, sadly.

1714
03:52:45,800 --> 03:53:03,800
I might have to do more on the VOD Squad since my hour is at Oracle Chance. That's perfectly fine. I don't mind.

1715
03:53:04,800 --> 03:53:11,800
Whenever you have the time, you'll always bop in because I believe in your loyalty. I believe in it.

1716
03:53:12,800 --> 03:53:21,800
Don't worry. I believe in you. And I'll always be streaming for you.

1717
03:53:21,800 --> 03:53:34,800
A bottle of drool.

1718
03:53:34,800 --> 03:53:44,800
I'm glad I got a bit of the stream. Glad to have you here. We're just about to end it though.

1719
03:53:45,800 --> 03:53:52,800
We're going to pop in and raid Marseille. Sweet baby Marseille.

1720
03:53:52,800 --> 03:54:03,800
And she's doing a karaoke stream today, I think. Yeah, she's doing a karaoke stream.

1721
03:54:03,800 --> 03:54:13,800
To get to hear her sing, because I can't. Not yet.

1722
03:54:14,800 --> 03:54:21,800
And you to hear her sing, you can hear her sweet little voice.

1723
03:54:22,800 --> 03:54:28,800
I'm actually excited to listen to it a little bit.

1724
03:54:33,800 --> 03:54:42,800
You'll be waiting for my karaoke one day? Yeah, I'll do a karaoke stream.

1725
03:54:43,800 --> 03:54:48,800
I know tons of songs already.

1726
03:54:48,800 --> 03:55:04,800
Maybe, but it'll probably be an unarchived, however you say it, stream so that I don't get smacked with anything bad.

1727
03:55:05,800 --> 03:55:11,800
It sums to radio. That'd be fun.

1728
03:55:12,800 --> 03:55:18,800
I would have to learn a bunch of songs in some long language.

1729
03:55:18,800 --> 03:55:34,800
He is irate.

1730
03:55:35,800 --> 03:55:40,800
Like the Stardew Valley. Stardew Streams aren't karaoke enough.

1731
03:55:41,800 --> 03:55:51,800
They were, but because they weren't marked as so, I got hit.

1732
03:55:52,800 --> 03:55:59,800
I got copyrighted in that stream, in both of them.

1733
03:55:59,800 --> 03:56:10,800
So we got to be careful in normal streaming.

1734
03:56:11,800 --> 03:56:15,800
I'm probably going to get hit for playing that one jingle just for a little bit.

1735
03:56:16,800 --> 03:56:22,800
So I'm probably going to go and mute that section of the stream.

1736
03:56:23,800 --> 03:56:27,800
Because I completely forgot when I played it.

1737
03:56:27,800 --> 03:56:34,800
Oopsie, I forgot, I forgot, I'm stupid.

1738
03:56:45,800 --> 03:56:48,800
Yeah, I better be safe than sorry, yeah.

1739
03:56:49,800 --> 03:56:56,800
I gotta stop forgetting, I gotta remember, but I do just like singing some jingles that pop into my head.

1740
03:56:57,800 --> 03:56:59,800
I'm sure you never know, yeah.

1741
03:57:00,800 --> 03:57:07,800

03:57:30,800 --> 03:57:33,800
You have the other girls you can watch and enjoy.

1746

See you in two days.

On Wednesday, I'll post my schedule up right after.

1751
03:58:00,800 --> 03:58:04,800
And I'll see my schedule and what we have planned for the week.

1752
03:58:04,800 --> 03:58:09,800
Yay, good night everyone, night night.

1753
03:58:10,800 --> 03:58:15,800
And I hope you all had a wonderful, happy Father's Day.

1754
03:58:19,800 --> 03:58:21,800
Bye bye.

1755
03:58:34,800 --> 03:58:47,800
Good night Daddy.
