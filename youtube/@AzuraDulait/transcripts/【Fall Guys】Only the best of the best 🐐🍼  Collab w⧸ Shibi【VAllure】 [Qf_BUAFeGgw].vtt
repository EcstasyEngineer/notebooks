24:31.040 --> 24:35.920
oh my god i'm gonna do your mod job for them but the thing on twitch is that you could

24:35.920 --> 24:43.520
like what is it what do you do uh you could separate the audio like the complete audio so that

24:43.520 --> 24:51.360
when you should go live on twitch they can't hear uh the music at all but they can hear the music

24:51.360 --> 24:58.480
when you're live but it doesn't stay in the vod so the vod doesn't get muted yeah yeah youtube the

24:58.480 --> 25:05.920
whole freaking vod gets muted yeah so you can't do that on youtube are you allowed to join yes you're

25:05.920 --> 25:12.400
allowed to join you think we just have 42 friends with us

25:19.520 --> 25:29.440
i'm not used to uh not singing i got used to it for me i kept getting demonetized um because of

25:29.440 --> 25:36.720
because of my boobs so i literally had a smack so much like strani was showing me

25:37.520 --> 25:44.320
her monetization versus mine and i was just like holy i was like ineligible ineligible ineligible

25:44.320 --> 25:50.560
copyright ineligible limited ads limited ads limited and i was like but then i changed thumbnails

25:50.560 --> 25:57.280
and stuff and i um i appealed a bunch and thankfully i was able to i wonder if i'll get

25:57.440 --> 26:03.360
i want to stuff i'll get hit with that after probably yeah like you've been doing the right thing

26:03.360 --> 26:10.960
with the the bread you have to cover your whole boob crack i changed it to the boob bubble tea

26:11.680 --> 26:16.320
you changed it to boob a tea oh that's funny i have i just have the sign in front of my boobs

26:16.960 --> 26:24.560
for you for today um yeah because it like it did make a difference if i didn't cover it all the way

26:24.560 --> 26:30.240
if the boob boob thing was still there but hey i think we'll be getting cover-ups anyways so

26:31.120 --> 26:38.400
very slow and i cannot wait i know i can button my shirt and maybe i can pop a button that'd be cool

26:39.920 --> 26:46.560
cool toggle oh i thought you just love bread yeah she loves bread so much she's just stuck

26:46.560 --> 26:52.000
it in between her boobs i love bread will you man it's the best thing that's how i chose it

26:53.600 --> 27:01.200
i need uh monison to cut out a picture of the harem um so i could stick it on my boobs just have

27:01.200 --> 27:08.240
you guys just wedged in between as a cover it's just funny how much the algorithm has changed because

27:08.240 --> 27:17.200
like evident by azura's song covering beauty pie boobs and the thumbnail that used to be such a main

27:18.480 --> 27:27.920
like thing like i struggled so hard singing that song really i had to do so many retakes

27:27.920 --> 27:34.560
because i could not stop laughing like i would see it i would laugh i would sing it i would laugh

27:34.560 --> 27:40.960
and it ended with me having to sing monotone because if i didn't sing monotone i would laugh

27:42.000 --> 27:46.160
i know like people are like why do you sound like you're singing because you're trying not to wake

27:46.160 --> 27:51.920
up your parents i'm like because i yeah i also couldn't take it seriously and i'm not a good singer so

27:54.240 --> 27:58.480
that's what i'm like and and it's so hard to match up

27:58.480 --> 28:08.640
um it's a hard to match a pitch of someone who also can't sing yeah that's the like yeah pretty can't sing right

28:08.640 --> 28:14.240
william johnson can't sing like i can come i could probably like the next song i'm probably gonna cover

28:14.240 --> 28:23.200
is like stacy's mom which i'll be able to sing because there's actual flow and yeah and most of the lines

28:23.200 --> 28:28.080
that that were put in the song it's literally a few words masked masked together

28:29.280 --> 28:35.280
and i have a lisp so pewdiepie's accent and my lisp do not mesh well

28:37.280 --> 28:41.920
i thought it really was good though i thought yours and shawnee's were actually like all of her

28:42.400 --> 28:47.040
things like yeah i did a lot of takes for mine and i was going insane listening to the song

28:47.120 --> 28:55.520
over and over and over again um and then yeah i was i didn't even they sent me the edited version

28:55.520 --> 28:59.520
i'm like yeah great because i was i'm like it's probably cringy as hell i'm not listening to this

29:01.360 --> 29:02.640
i don't want to hear myself

29:05.440 --> 29:11.760
it was fun though really fun experience yeah i like because of that i now i know what's involved

29:12.240 --> 29:17.600
i really want to try harder and do a better cover you want to do one with me

29:18.960 --> 29:26.960
what song i don't know that'd be cool though i don't know what's i don't know what we could do

29:27.600 --> 29:31.920
can you i have a bunch of songs already on list that i want to do for covers

29:31.920 --> 29:39.840
like i have a big list yeah a little bit yeah a little bit i'm like trying to think

29:40.080 --> 29:44.480
a little bit it can't be high card rap like like extremely like

29:46.640 --> 29:51.600
we're not covering rap god i'm not i'm not i'm not i don't wanna do

29:58.400 --> 30:02.880
well what song would you think um you sounded like you didn't want to be there

30:03.200 --> 30:09.440
what song what song would you guys want us to cover little john

30:11.600 --> 30:12.480

30:16.480 --> 30:18.080
little john is on the menu

30:19.040 --> 30:19.680
you

30:21.440 --> 30:24.240
in the club with mohommies and then it's just

30:39.840 --> 30:45.760
i think it would be cool if we um did like an english cover of like as a

30:46.560 --> 30:49.520
i could hear his music i was like uh

30:50.880 --> 30:55.280
actually no i feel like i feel like k-pop girlies will come for us because i was gonna say a k-pop song

30:56.560 --> 31:03.040
um i think because this because like we can just find a girl group of six and just pick a person and do the lines

31:04.160 --> 31:11.040
flow rida shuddy got them apple bottom oh i'm gonna put a karaoke for next week i should do that

You should be scared. You should be very scared.

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:32.120
I got toast. I got some peanut butter and Nutella toast.

01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:35.120
Usually I put some banana on it, but I don't have any banana.

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:45.120
I kept hearing about how people see her as mommy and all, but one of the first drinks.

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:48.120
I went to person involved or being concerned about our new toaster.

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:51.120
Yes, Azura is cute as fuck.

01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:01.120
All the girls have quite a bit of gat moe.

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:03.120
Moe, sorry.

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.120
Nutella, yeah, it's like a hazelnut spread.

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:23.120
Yeah, she's a cutesy caring type and then I'm the Sundari type.

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:32.120
Sundari, but you actually hate us.

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:34.120
I don't hate you guys.

01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:36.120
Don't say that maybe.

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:38.120
I don't know.

01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:40.120
I should think about it.

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:53.120
Sundari, but you actually beat us to death.

01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:57.120
Yes, let me beat the shit out of you.

01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:00.120
Azura has got meow.

01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:02.120
I'll see myself.

01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:06.120
Meow.

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.120
Oh, that was good.

01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:14.120
I hate this affectionately.

01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:22.120
Yeah, I got to keep you guessing, guys.

01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:31.120
I'm going to sacrifice myself so Azura gets to the final round.

01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:40.120
I don't know what she's getting as a snack.

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:44.120
I feel like she's getting some sort of fruit or crackers.

01:37:53.120 --> 01:38:02.120
Or toast, she just burns her toast.

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:09.120
Eating animation under her mouth.

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:11.120
It's actually just my mouth tracking.

01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:21.120
I promise you, I don't chew with my mouth open,

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:25.120
but the model tracking picks it up as I'm being like...

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:45.120
I'm making rice ball.

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:48.120
You're making a rice ball?

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:52.120
That's not a snack, that's a whole ass rice ball.

01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:00.120
How are you making it?

01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:09.120
No, but rice balls are different in different places,

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:12.120
but what type of rice ball are you making?

01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:16.120
For me, a rice ball, I think of Italian rice balls,

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:19.120
but you're probably doing a Japanese rice ball.

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:21.120
Most likely Japanese.

01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:28.120
Yeah, but I don't have anything to put in it.

01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:31.120
So you're literally just eating a ball of rice.

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.120
I tried to look for something to put in it,

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:39.120
and I set it up to put something in it,

01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:41.120
and then I was like,

01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:43.120
let me put something in it,

01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:45.120
and then I don't have anything.

01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:47.120
I could have put tuna in it,

01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:49.120
but then I would have to go get it.

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:51.120
I was going to say,

01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:53.120
do you have tuna, canned tuna,

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:55.120
and put tomato in it or something?

01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:59.120
Rice ball filled with air.

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:05.120
No cheese.

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:08.120
My fridge is so empty.

01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:10.120
So is mine.

01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:16.120
I desperately need to go grocery shopping,

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:18.120
but I'm just way too lazy.

01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:21.120
It's too much of an effort to get ready

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:23.120
just to go to the grocery store.

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:27.120
Oh my God, that's very relatable.

01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:31.120
Let me go watch my hand.

01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:34.120
I did this without a glove.

01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:37.120
Gasp! She went in raw.

01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:40.120
She went in raw.

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.120
Reminds me of this one,

01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:53.120
Chinese mythology I learned.

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:55.120
Basically, the lead girl was supposed to slay a dragon.

01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.120
She set up rice balls, so the dragon would be like,

01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:59.120
ooh, snacks.

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:03.120
Rice is the best snack, all right?

01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:07.120
I think I have some like Jasmine rice.

01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:10.120
I'm chewing.

01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:28.120
No glove, extra love.

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:34.120
Yeah, I love biryani rice.

01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:37.120
Oh no, I broke this.

01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:40.120
Oh no, that's not good.

01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:43.120
My salt, the opening of my salt,

01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:45.120
it can only open one way.

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:49.120
It's completely broken.

01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.120
How did that happen?

01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:53.120
I don't know, I think I stepped on it.

01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:56.120
How did you step on it?

01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:58.120
I don't know, I'm lazy,

01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:00.120
and I never put things back on the top of my fridge,

01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:02.120
and they end up on the floor.

01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:05.120
Damn, bitch, you live like this?

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:09.120
I literally have my toaster on the floor.

01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:12.120
Why is your toaster on the floor?

01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:15.120
I have nowhere to put it.

01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:18.120
I have nowhere to put it.

01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:22.120
You don't have a counter to put it on?

01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:28.120
Do you need to clean off your counter, Sarah?

01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:32.120
If anyone can see how cluttered my room looked,

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:34.120
you'd be appalled.

01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:39.120
I can't even look at my TV,

01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:42.120
there's like things in front of it blocking it,

01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:44.120
things hanging off of the TV.

01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:47.120
I feel a little bit better, but the little,

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.120
little bit of clutter that's at my house,

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.120
I mostly picked up yesterday.

01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:54.120
Squalor core, mama.

01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:59.120
They literally just called you squalor core.

01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:03.120
As there is a true knee, 100%.

01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:09.120
It's true, want to hear my bag of bottles?

01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:11.120
Please.

01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:15.120

01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:19.120

01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:20.120
Do it again?

01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:31.120
Do you just have a bag of piss bottles?

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:33.120
What? No!

01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:39.120

Just watch either my bunny garden playthrough or my class of 09 playthrough the first one

01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:01.960

01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:22.960

01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:23.960
I don't either

01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:25.960

01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:27.960

I don't think YouTube likes brown people

01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:30.960

Actually no there is one girl in a different company that's brown

01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:09.960
We are your brown chubas

01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:10.960

01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:13.960

01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:18.960
Relax

01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:20.960
It's fine

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:23.960
She didn't even have to cover up her tatas bro

01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:24.960
It's not fair

01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:25.960
Yeah

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:27.960
It's literally

01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:30.960
The reason why we're both getting demonetized is because

01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:32.960
Me and Azura have giant titties

01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:37.960
And I just started covering up mine in the thumbnails

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:40.960
And so then I was able to get monetized

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:43.960
And I don't have copyright issues like you have

01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:44.960
That's another thing

01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:46.960
Thank you for the gift dude

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:48.960
Much thanks

01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:52.960
She had to throw that one last jab in

01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:54.960
I'm just saying

01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:57.960
I was wondering that

01:47:57.960 --> 01:47:58.960
Excuse me I was wondering that too though

01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:00.960
Because I'm like why the hell

01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:03.960
Was Azura getting monetized for me

01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:07.960
And then I remember you talking about the copyright strikes

01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:08.960
In Discord

01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:10.960
And I was like okay that makes a little bit more sense then

01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:11.960
Because

01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:12.960
Yeah

01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:15.960
The only copyright I got was for

01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:17.960
The Vampire the Masquerade music

01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:19.960
And I was pissed about that

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.960
Because it's literally the club asylum music

01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:23.960
And I'm like why would I get copyrighted on that?

01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:26.960
So I disputed it because it's fucking stupid

01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:29.960
It isn't fair

01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:30.960
It isn't fair

01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:33.960
And they can't dispute the copyright strikes

01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:38.960
Because they're the scammers

01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:39.960
Yeah

01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:44.960
So all you can do is like mute it and wait

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:48.960
Mute, wait and hopefully YouTube will like hit them

01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:53.960
For being, for faking a copyright

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:54.960
Yeah

01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:58.960
So even though Azura doesn't have memberships open

01:48:58.960 --> 01:48:59.960
Is a monetized yet

01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:03.960
You could still support her by once a month

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:05.960
Giving five dollars

01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:09.960
On her Patreon

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:11.960
And through streamelevance

01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:16.960
By her merch

01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:18.960
By my merch

01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:21.960
Come support me please

01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:22.960
I need it

01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:23.960
Yeah I need it

01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:28.960
Azura's info

01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:30.960
Is in the description below

01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:32.960
Please go to her channel

01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:34.960
Like, comment, subscribe

01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:38.960
Smash her two giant brown like buttons

01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:43.960
If I pay you fifteen dollars will you clean your room?

01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:44.960
So much so

01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:45.960
Aw shit

01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:50.960
Yeah

01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:52.960
Ring her bell

01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:53.960
You gotta ring her bell too

01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:55.960
Make sure you ring her bell

01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:57.960
Yeah, I'll do that

01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:10.960
I have so many plates in here

01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:15.960
I got my bed frame in

01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:18.960
And I, cause I've been sleeping on a mattress on my floor

01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:21.960
In my apartment for like almost two years now

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:25.960
And just like me and my cats in my bed

01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:27.960
And so I have to go downstairs

01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:29.960
Bring up this, go to the bathroom

01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:31.960
Bring up several flights

01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:33.960
Thankfully we have an elevator

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:37.960
And then I don't know how I'm gonna move my mattress

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:39.960
And then build the thing

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.960
And then put the mattress on top of my bed

01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:43.960
It is so fucking heavy

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:45.960
It's a lot of work

01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:47.960
Just put the mattress on the floor

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:50.960
But like it's not good to have a mattress on the floor

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:53.960
Because the moisture and the heat from your body

01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:55.960
Cause the floor is carpeted

01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:57.960
Oh, you have carpet

01:50:57.960 --> 01:50:58.960
Yeah

01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:01.960
I never had a mattress before that

01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:03.960
I didn't have a mattress before that

01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:05.960
So I slept on my floor

01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:07.960
And I don't have carpet

01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:08.960
Oh, ow

01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:10.960
Could you have a bed roll or something

01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:12.960
No, I just slept on a sheet

01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:14.960
And a blanket

01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:16.960
Oh

01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.960
Somebody buy her a bed

01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:22.960
Well, get it out of her house right now

01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:24.960
She needs her own place

01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:25.960
I have a bed now

01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:28.960
One of my family members lent me a mattress

01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:30.960
Yeah, but you need a...

01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:31.960
They lent it to you?

01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:33.960
Do they have to give it back?

01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:35.960
Do you have to give it back to them?

01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:36.960
No

01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:40.960
They gave me a mattress

01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:42.960
Why?

01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:46.960
Please

01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:49.960
For only the small amount

01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:51.960
Of five dollars a month

01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:55.960
You can support your favorite brown vtuber, Izura

01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:57.960
Thank you so much for the ten

01:51:57.960 --> 01:51:59.960
No, not of us

01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:02.960
Please get her out of that

01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:04.960
Please let her have her own apartment

01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:06.960
So she could be

01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:08.960
As messy as she wants to

01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:12.960
Five dollars

01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:14.960
I have to put a bed roll

01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:17.960
Yeah, so I have to figure out

01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:19.960
I might have to ask my dad and my mom for help

01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:21.960
Or maybe some friends because I cannot

01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:23.960
The bed is way too heavy

01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:25.960
It's fucking huge

01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:29.960
They will like cleaning ASMR

01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:32.960
That would actually be cool

01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:34.960
You could do a twitter space

01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:36.960
And you could just ramble and chat while you clean your room

01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:38.960
That's actually might help you

01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:40.960
I might have ADHD

01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:43.960
Well, they can help you stay on

01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:45.960
Focus

01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:48.960
For me, I have to have something

01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:50.960
Playing in the background

01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:51.960
Yeah, like music

01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:53.960
Yeah, otherwise it can't focus

01:52:56.960 --> 01:52:58.960
We need a dono goal

01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:01.960
Yeah, Izura, you need to make a dono goal

01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:03.960
On your throne saying get me out of my house

01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:06.960
And then just put the first and last month of rent

01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:08.960
For wherever you are

01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:11.960
For the goal

01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:13.960
Maybe the donathon that I'm going to have

01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:14.960
For my birthday

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:16.960
Oh true, your birthday

01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:18.960
It's August, right?

01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:20.960
Yeah, August 21

01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:22.960
Yeah

01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:24.960
Mark out on your calendars, ladies and gentlemen

01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:26.960
Yeah, come to my birthday

01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:28.960
Come and celebrate with me

01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:30.960
I'm very excited

01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:32.960
Because you'll be the first one of us to have a donathon

01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:34.960
Yeah

01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:36.960
We're gonna stay up longer

01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:38.960
Oh, and yeah, I think mine's after yours

01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:40.960
Because I'm September 28

01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:42.960
So

01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:44.960
Scary

01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:46.960
I might try to do a 24 hour

01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:48.960
I have to talk to Strani about it

01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:50.960
Like an actual 24 hours

01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:52.960
I think all of us are doing 24 hours, no

01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:54.960
But not like 12 hours a day

01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:56.960
But like continuous streaming

01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:58.960
Yeah, like for 24 hours

01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:00.960
That's what I was gonna do

01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:02.960
Oh, fuck yeah, okay, perfect

01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:04.960
Sounds like so confused

01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:06.960
I'm not supposed to do that

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:08.960
No, sometimes people say they do like a 24 hour

01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:10.960
Donathon, but then they break it up over a couple

01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:12.960
Days

01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:14.960
True

01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:16.960
So, yeah

01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:18.960
So we

01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:20.960
But like I think

01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:22.960
We're kind of known for

01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:24.960
We do a lot of endurance stuff

01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:26.960
Between me, actually everybody I think has done

01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:28.960
At least one endurance stream

01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:30.960
I think

01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:32.960
I'm not quite sure

01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:34.960
Yeah, I don't even know what I want to do for my

01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:36.960
Donathon

01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:38.960
I have a few plans to do

01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:40.960
But I'm gonna do a Zatsu

01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:42.960
We're all gonna chat about what we're gonna do

01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:44.960
What they want me to do

01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:46.960
What they do with ideas and stuff

01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:48.960
We have a few already

01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:50.960
So what I'm going to

01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:52.960
Dooring the Donathon is what I don't know

01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:54.960
Yeah, there's somebody

01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:56.960
That's so far behind in your VOD

01:54:56.960 --> 01:54:58.960
And it's really funny because they just responded with

01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:00.960
Lent you like with the bed thing

01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:02.960
Let me talk about it 10 minutes ago

01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:06.960
This one

01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:08.960
Poor thing

01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:10.960
Yeah, VODs end at 12 hours

01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:12.960
So yeah, they'll have to be two parts

01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:14.960
But I think it'll be cool

01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:16.960
Yeah

01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:18.960
I do that and then in the 12th part

01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:20.960
You can take a breakie

01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:22.960
Before the next one

01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:24.960
You can do like a smoke breakie

01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:26.960
I didn't say that

01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:28.960
I didn't say that

01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:30.960
I didn't say that

01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:32.960
A small breakie

01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:34.960
That's what you said

01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:36.960
I'm sorry

01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:38.960
I'm sorry

01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:40.960
I totally misheard

01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:42.960
I was like A.O

01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:44.960
Imagine

01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:46.960
Like Azura dressed as like

01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:48.960
A beautiful 1920s flapper

01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:50.960
With one of those cool

01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:52.960
Cigarette holders in her mouth

01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:54.960
And she's like hey dawg

01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:56.960
She was talking about cigarettes

01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:58.960
I thought she was talking about something else

01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:00.960
Entirely different

01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:02.960
Bro, we are not on the same page

01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:14.960
I'm like laughing behind you

01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:18.960
I was just like

01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:20.960
Sultry cigarettes

01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:22.960
After copulation

01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:24.960
I didn't talk about

01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:26.960
You know grass

01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:30.960
Like outside

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:40.960
Okay, what?

01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:44.960
I love struggling to breathe

01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:48.960
The dank grass

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:50.960
What?

01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:56.960
I got it

01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:58.960
I understand now

01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:02.960
I get it, I'm smart

01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:04.960
The devil's lettuce

01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:06.960
Indeed

01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:12.960
Whoops

01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:14.960
I think I killed Azura

01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:20.960
The wacky tobacco

01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:24.960
The sticky icky

01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:44.960
Okay

01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:46.960
Azura breathes

01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:50.960
Like

01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:52.960
The za

01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:54.960
Like pizza

01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:56.960
Like I

01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:58.960
When people say za I think of pizza

01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:00.960
Like you want to grab a slice of za

01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:06.960
I can't tell either

01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:08.960
If she's kidding

01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:10.960
She's not so far away like she ran across the room to cry

01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:16.960
She be here's blinker

01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:18.960
What's

01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:20.960
What the fuck is a blinker

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:22.960
I'm thinking about cars

01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:24.960
I don't

01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:26.960
They call it, what's a

01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:28.960
Is that like

01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:30.960
I've never heard of that

01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:32.960
I've never heard that called that

01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:40.960
When you hit a vape for long enough

01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:42.960
And the light starts blink

01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:44.960
Like

01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:46.960
I have friends that smoke vapes

01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:48.960
And stuff

01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:50.960
I didn't know that was a thing

01:58:56.960 --> 01:58:58.960
Wait till

01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:00.960
I'll expose myself more right now

01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:02.960
A part of me

01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:04.960
Was very thankful

01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:06.960
That nobody recalled

01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:08.960
In my past life

01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:10.960
That I sat during a stream

01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:12.960
For about an hour

01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:14.960
Debating male anatomy

01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:16.960
With my viewers because I thought

01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:20.960
I thought

01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:24.960
That

01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:26.960
The little

01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:28.960
You know beans in the sack

01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:30.960
Were on

01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:32.960
Like behind your legs

01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:36.960
And that's why you had to like

01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:38.960
Manspray

01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:40.960
And I remember just like complaining

01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:42.960
Because I'm just like

01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:44.960
Men's anatomy is just so weird

01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:46.960
Because it's like why is it on the front like that

01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:50.960
And I thought it was because I'm thinking about like

01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:52.960
In terms of like the distance of like a woman's

01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:54.960
Stuff and a man's stuff

01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:56.960
I'm like isn't okay is the ball in between

01:59:56.960 --> 01:59:58.960
The leg like

02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:02.960
And so I remember I was drawing

02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:04.960
My example for people

02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:06.960
And they were just like kind of doing

02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:08.960
What's happening now

02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:10.960
And I was

02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:12.960
And I don't know

02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:14.960
Why I thought that because it's not like I don't

02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:16.960
Like I don't want stuff so I'm just

02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:18.960
But I'd like

02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:20.960
You know

02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:22.960
I'm just going to stop talking

02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:28.960
You want me to draw it again?

02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:38.960
Yeah

02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:44.960
Oh god she's drawing it

02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:46.960
I gotta see this

02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:48.960
I gotta see this

02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:50.960
I'll show you

02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:52.960
What I need

02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:56.960
I need to see this

02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:00.960
People forget

02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:02.960
I grew up in a very religious Christian household

02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:08.960
Cool

02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:10.960
I'm sweating so bad

02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:18.960
Wait they actually taught you

02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:20.960
Like they actually taught you

02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:22.960
I thought like you were like in a religious household

02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:24.960
Where like they like kept you away from them

02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:26.960
Because my mom

02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:28.960
My parents were like we don't want you getting molested

02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:30.960
So like here's some information

02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:34.960
And they're like if somebody asks you to do this

02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:36.960
Don't do it

02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:38.960
But I don't even remember my sex ed class

02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:40.960
In high school like I'll be honest with you

02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:42.960
Like I think I might have like blanked

02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:44.960
That out for my own mental health

02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:46.960
And safety

02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:48.960
Yeah pretty decent parents

02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:50.960
Telling you that early age

02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:52.960
Oh yeah yeah yeah

02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:54.960
Being a girl and an only child

02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:56.960
They didn't want me to get like

02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:58.960
Diddle by someone in church or whatever

02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:00.960
So

02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:02.960
Every time she hits me with these like

02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:04.960
Terms

02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:06.960
It really shocks me

02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:10.960
So this is the head of the dude

02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:12.960
And he's just hanging out

02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:14.960
And then I'm going to do this from the side

02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:16.960
So I'm going to

02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:18.960
This is his leg

02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:20.960
Wait we can't see

02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:22.960
We can't see it

02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:24.960
What do you mean you can't see it

02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:26.960
Oh wait I'm delayed nevermind

02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:28.960
Don't worry about me

02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:30.960
Okay and so I thought

02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:34.960
Um

02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:36.960
I kind of made his leg too thick

02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:38.960
Don't worry about it

02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:40.960
I thought like this is the butt

02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:42.960
And

02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:44.960
Let me get this one

02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:46.960
How do I make this bigger

02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:48.960
Damn look at that cake

02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:50.960
I know he's kind of he's caked up

02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:52.960
He's caked up

02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:54.960
So

02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:56.960
I thought

02:02:56.960 --> 02:02:58.960
Like a guy's stuff was over here

02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:00.960
Like that's where the peepee is

02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:02.960
Where the balls are

02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:04.960
Because they're like in between the legs

02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:06.960
But then

02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:08.960
Come to find out

02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:10.960
They're actually like weirdly at the front

02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:12.960
And I just think that's stupid

02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:14.960
Because as a woman

02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:16.960
You know you have like

02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:18.960
There's like too much space between asshole

02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:20.960
And the balls

02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:22.960
I just think it's dumb

02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:24.960
Whereas as a woman your stuff is just like down here

02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:26.960
All chilling

02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:28.960
And then you got your asshole

02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:30.960
Like

02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:32.960
The space between

02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:34.960
A man's asshole and the balls

02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:36.960
You want to pin

02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:38.960
What

02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:40.960
Do you want to pinch it

02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:42.960
I've heard it's called the Gooch

02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:44.960
Yes the Gooch existence

02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:46.960
I think it's stupid

02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:48.960
I don't like men anatomy

02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:50.960
I feel like their stuff should be a little bit different

02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:52.960
But yeah the women's stuff is there

02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:54.960
So I'm just like

02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:56.960
Like I feel like I could just pop this off

02:03:56.960 --> 02:03:58.960
And make you a kendall

02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:00.960
And then your asshole is all the way over here

02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:02.960
Like I don't understand it it's stupid

02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:04.960
Like there's too much space

02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:06.960
There's too much distance

02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:12.960
I think the reason why the tack is on the front like that

02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:14.960
Because it's the root of where it grew

02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:16.960
What

02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:20.960
Anatomy was

02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:22.960
Guys stop

02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:24.960
I thought that prostate was like inside

02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:26.960
Yeah isn't that inside

02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:28.960
Yeah the prostate is inside

02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:30.960
Yeah that's in like

02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:32.960
You got the booty hole and then it's like

02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:34.960
Because the man's geospot is literally in their booty hole

02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:36.960
Yeah

02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:38.960
And then I know like they can also get there

02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:40.960
With like sounding and stuff

02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:42.960
Which is terrifying by the way

02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:46.960
P is stored in the balls

02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:48.960
That's true

02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:50.960
You know I remember when I was younger

02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:52.960
In mind you again I was probably like 5

02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:54.960
And they got me about like

02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:56.960
Like how to make sure that I'm not being taken advantage of

02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:58.960
So I don't remember a lot

02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:00.960
Because they bought me like a whole ass anatomy book

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:02.960
And they also got me a little book

02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:04.960
I think it's called

02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:06.960
The caring keeping of you

02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:08.960
Which is really cool for like girls who are going through puberty

02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:10.960
But like I also

02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:12.960
It took me a while to figure out where my pee hole was

02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:14.960
Because I thought I peed out of my clit for the longest time

02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:16.960
But I discovered that wasn't the case

02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:18.960
Are you serious?

02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:20.960
Damn what's going on

02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:22.960
Was I just

02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:24.960
Was I just that exploratory

02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:26.960
When I was younger

02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:28.960
I knew all of this from the get

02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:30.960
Like what do you mean vods cooked

02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:32.960
Vods fine

02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:34.960
This is educational purposes

02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:36.960
Yes educational

02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:38.960
Educational purposes

02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:40.960
Educational purposes

02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:44.960
Precisely

02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:46.960
I'm getting educated

02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:48.960
Well I've been educated

02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:50.960
But like this was probably a couple months ago

02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:54.960
What just happened excuse me

02:05:58.960 --> 02:06:00.960
I think I was just very exploratory

02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:02.960
Just overall with anatomy

02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:04.960
As a whole since I was very very young

02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:06.960
But it's funny cause like

02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:08.960
I would draw in stuff

02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:10.960
But I didn't draw like that stuff

02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:12.960
And then like I would read like

02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:14.960
Yeah and like watch stuff

02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:16.960
Like a little fuji

02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:18.960
There's no way that you watch

02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:20.960
Yahweh

02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:22.960
And didn't understand the anatomy

02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:24.960
Of the

02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:26.960
Of the boobda

02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:28.960
I think it was like object permanence

02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:30.960
I don't know like I just thought

02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:32.960
It like moves around more often

02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:34.960
But it's really just tack to the front

02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:36.960
And I thought you could like tuck it

02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:38.960
Like that's why I'm like oh guys can tuck

02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:40.960
If they don't want to like show

02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:42.960
How much they're packing you know

02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:44.960
You know

02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:48.960
Am I just embarrassing myself

02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:50.960
Why am I in the poor corpo

02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:52.960
Of the anatomy

02:06:56.960 --> 02:06:58.960
I was curious since day one

02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:00.960
I really thought that when they showed you the

02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:02.960
The you know the

02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:04.960
Sacky wacky

02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:06.960
Can't call it a Sacky wacky

02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:10.960
When they showed you it in the pictures

02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:12.960
I always thought it was like an egg

02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:14.960
And I kept thinking of packing it

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:16.960
So I was very curious

02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:18.960
And like

02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:20.960
Because like

02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:22.960
Their stuff is on the inside

02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:24.960
I thought it was

02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:26.960
I didn't know there was like holding stuff on the inside

02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:28.960
I thought it was like the organ itself

02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:30.960
Like I didn't like the sack is holding the testies

02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:32.960
I just thought it was like

02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:34.960
It was the testies just covered in skin

02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:38.960
Don't crack it everybody is terrified

02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:40.960
Of you cracking the nuts

02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:42.960
Oh say crack the nuts

02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:44.960
Yeah

02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:46.960
I always thought it was

02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:48.960
It would actually crack

02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:50.960
When I was younger I was like

02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:52.960
I accidentally kicked someone

02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:54.960
A long time ago

02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:56.960
It was an accident

02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:58.960
I didn't do it on purpose

02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:00.960
Believe me

02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:02.960
Believe me

02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:04.960
It wasn't on purpose

02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:06.960
I remember when I was younger

02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:08.960
I was playing tag with friends

02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:10.960
At recess

02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:12.960
I don't know if any European friends know what recess is

02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:14.960
But just like break time

02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:16.960
From after lunch and stuff

02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:18.960
And we were playing tag

02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:20.960
And this one kid jumped off of a

02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:22.960
We had like these like benches

02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:24.960
And he jumped off of it

02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:26.960
And I went to go tag him

02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:28.960
And I ended up punching him in the nuts

02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:30.960
As he jumped off

02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:32.960
And he just started crying

02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:34.960
And I being a girl

02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:36.960
Called him a little bitch because I'm like

02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:38.960
Why the fuck do you cry cause like I've taken

02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:40.960
I've taken shots to the pussy

02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:42.960
You know

02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:44.960
There's no way because I remember

02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:46.960
When I was younger I fell

02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:48.960
You know those old wooden beds

02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:50.960
Oh yeah

02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:52.960
I fell on one

02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:54.960
Yeah I fell on the headboard

02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:56.960
Like I was fucking with it

02:08:56.960 --> 02:08:58.960
Cause you know I was like a badass child

02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:00.960
When I was little I was like running around

02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:02.960
Jumping on the bed and like on the board

02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:04.960
And like doing flips and shit

02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:06.960
And then I slipped

02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:08.960
And I fell in between on the bed

02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:10.960
And ran between my legs

02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:12.960
No that shit hurt

02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:14.960
Like I thought I broke bone

02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:16.960
I thought I cracked bone

02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:18.960
Does that mean my pussy can take more of a pound

02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:20.960
I don't know bro

02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:22.960
Cause there's no fucking way that you didn't feel shit

02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:24.960
There's no way

02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:26.960
Okay the only time

02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:28.960
The only time it hurt

02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:30.960
The only time it's hurt for me

02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:32.960
Nobody really does that a lot

02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:34.960
The only time it's hurt for me

02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:36.960
I'm gonna draw

02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:38.960
This is educational

02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:40.960
So like you know there's like

02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:42.960
The pubic bone like up here

02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:44.960
Or it's like your lippies are right there

02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:46.960
It's like this bone

02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:48.960
I had there was a girl that like

02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:50.960
This looks like a bush

02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:52.960
There was a girl that cut this out

02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:54.960
Like right there

02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:56.960
There was a girl that swung

02:09:56.960 --> 02:09:58.960
Her music case that had like her clarinet

02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:00.960
Or something and it hit me right at the bone

02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:02.960
This one is nuked

02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:04.960
And I'm just cutting this out

02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:06.960
Don't worry about it

02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:08.960
And it hurt so bad

02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:10.960
Like that was the only time it was like on the tip

02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:12.960
Like the bone like right where your

02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:14.960
Pussy lips start to happen

02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:16.960
Yeah that really hurt

02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:18.960
Like I've bruised that before

02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:20.960
Like going too hard but otherwise

02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:24.960

This is the energy you have when you are like to try to sleep.

I fell so bad for my cat, but my cat was a thrasher too.

02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:47.560
We'd sleep and he'd sleep on my chest.

02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:51.560
And he'd sleep and I'd lay there like sprawled out.

02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:54.560
And he'd be like on my chest, sprawled out.

02:44:57.560 --> 02:45:00.560
And we'd sleep like that and he'd snore.

02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:03.560
My cat was a snorer, he'd snore and he'd be like...

02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:11.560
Shuu. Shuu. Shuu.

02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:16.560
You ever heard a cat snore before?

02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:30.560
He'll say lucky cat, but he was a good boy.

02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:33.560
I miss him very dearly.

02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:39.560
My cat had a whistle in his snore.

02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:44.560
Instead of like a shuu, it would come out like...

02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:53.560

02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:54.560

02:45:58.560 --> 02:46:00.560

02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:24.560

02:46:37.560 --> 02:46:40.560

02:46:40.560 --> 02:46:45.560
If you have anyone else you can want to, can or want to read, you can do that.

02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:47.560
That's fine.

02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:49.560

02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:51.560

02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:54.560
I'm gonna take like an hour break before I start stream back up.

02:46:55.560 --> 02:47:00.560

02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:02.560

02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:09.560

02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:31.560

02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:35.560

02:47:35.560 --> 02:47:39.560
Someone literally asked me that I'm the morrow.

02:47:58.560 --> 02:48:00.560
And I was like...

02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:14.560

02:48:14.560 --> 02:48:16.560

02:52:08.500 --> 02:52:10.500
28

02:52:10.500 --> 02:52:12.500
28

02:52:12.500 --> 02:52:14.500
28

02:52:14.500 --> 02:52:16.500
28

02:52:16.500 --> 02:52:18.500
28

02:52:18.500 --> 02:52:20.500
28

02:52:20.500 --> 02:52:22.500
28

02:52:22.500 --> 02:52:24.500
28

02:52:24.500 --> 02:52:26.500
28

02:52:26.500 --> 02:52:28.500
28

02:52:28.500 --> 02:52:39.500
because it was butt medication and I was tired of taking it and before I was taking the pill that you like the suppository and then

02:52:39.500 --> 02:52:52.500
and then they were like I was like oh it's really uncomfortable and then they were like okay well we can give you an enema and I was like okay I'll take that and then I didn't realize how uncomfortable it was

02:52:52.500 --> 02:53:06.500
and then like so then they just piled up and then they were like okay we'll just switch you back to whatever and I was like okay and then I just have an enema medication on my floor

02:53:06.500 --> 02:53:08.500
I don't know what to do with it

02:53:15.500 --> 02:53:19.500
what do I do with this, this here, this here

02:53:23.500 --> 02:53:24.500
I don't know

02:53:25.500 --> 02:53:30.500
it's either I take it because they said I could still continue to take it I finish it

02:53:30.500 --> 02:53:37.500
like I take it I finish it or I don't know just throw it out do you just throw it on the trash

02:53:38.500 --> 02:53:40.500
do you just throw it on the trash

02:53:41.500 --> 02:53:42.500
and then it's like

02:53:43.500 --> 02:53:48.500
I have clothes but the clothes isn't an issue because I have like bags for those

02:53:48.500 --> 02:53:53.500
and I just throw those in a pile and I re-wash clothes because I don't go outside anyways

02:53:53.500 --> 02:53:55.500
so I like rarely wear anything

02:54:02.500 --> 02:54:04.500
I really wear these things

02:54:04.500 --> 02:54:06.500
I don't know just take it

02:54:07.500 --> 02:54:15.500
throw it in a pile and then wash it and then put it away and then pull it back out again

02:54:22.500 --> 02:54:24.500
my room used to be so clean

02:54:26.500 --> 02:54:31.500
but then it got so bad once I got into violor

02:54:31.500 --> 02:54:33.500
I don't know what happened

02:54:35.500 --> 02:54:38.500
it just it just kept getting worse

02:54:39.500 --> 02:54:42.500
I don't know what happened

02:54:46.500 --> 02:54:49.500
it was like semi clean it was lately better

02:54:50.500 --> 02:54:55.500
I had space to walk in now you can only walk in a straight line to get into my room and out

02:54:56.500 --> 02:54:58.500
there's so much stuff in the way

02:55:04.500 --> 02:55:07.500
room got as dirty as your mind

02:55:11.500 --> 02:55:13.500
lack of time most likely

02:55:14.500 --> 02:55:17.500
I spent ever since I got into violor I spent like

02:55:18.500 --> 02:55:22.500
like a majority of the time sleeping

02:55:22.500 --> 02:55:24.500
just sleeping

02:55:24.500 --> 02:55:26.500
I've been so tired

02:55:28.500 --> 02:55:30.500
so tired

02:55:30.500 --> 02:55:32.500
I just sleep

02:55:34.500 --> 02:55:36.500
sleep

02:55:42.500 --> 02:55:47.500
damn my neighbors are being jerks right now

02:56:05.500 --> 02:56:07.500
hahaha

02:56:15.500 --> 02:56:18.500
I thought the gremlin thing was just a quirky thing

02:56:18.500 --> 02:56:22.500
now you are actually a gremlin

02:56:22.500 --> 02:56:24.500
I'm a gremlin

02:56:24.500 --> 02:56:26.500
for real for real

02:56:27.500 --> 02:56:29.500
I'm an actual gremlin

02:56:29.500 --> 02:56:32.500
I'm an anime nerded gremlin

02:56:32.500 --> 02:56:35.500
and spent most of my time watching anime

02:56:35.500 --> 02:56:38.500
scared to socialize with humans

02:56:41.500 --> 02:56:43.500
humans are scary

02:56:43.500 --> 02:56:45.500
scary human

02:56:46.500 --> 02:56:48.500
wow

02:56:49.500 --> 02:56:51.500
I want to do a room cleaning

02:56:51.500 --> 02:56:54.500
a room cleaning ASMR

02:56:56.500 --> 02:57:00.500
like a Zatsudan room cleaning ASMR

02:57:02.500 --> 02:57:04.500
sleep stream

02:57:14.500 --> 02:57:17.500
sleep stream where viewers can send in videos

02:57:17.500 --> 02:57:21.500
yes yes maybe possibly we'll have to have someone go through

02:57:23.500 --> 02:57:26.500
we'd probably end up doing a sleep stream on the

02:57:26.500 --> 02:57:28.500
on the tonothon

02:57:29.500 --> 02:57:31.500
probably maybe

02:57:31.500 --> 02:57:33.500
possibly

02:57:36.500 --> 02:57:38.500
or

02:57:38.500 --> 02:57:43.500
or it would be in two parts since stream stops at 12 hours

02:57:43.500 --> 02:57:46.500
it would be in two parts I stay awake for 12 hours

02:57:46.500 --> 02:57:48.500
and then

02:57:49.500 --> 02:57:52.500
in between the mark I go to sleep

02:57:52.500 --> 02:57:54.500
and then I wake up

02:57:54.500 --> 02:57:56.500
I wake up

02:57:58.500 --> 02:58:03.500
and then stream the next part

02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:05.500
wow I'm actually getting really tired

02:58:05.500 --> 02:58:07.500
holy moly

02:58:12.500 --> 02:58:14.500
holy moly

02:58:16.500 --> 02:58:18.500
I'm gonna have to look after you

02:58:18.500 --> 02:58:20.500
you don't I'm fine

02:58:21.500 --> 02:58:23.500
I'm a big girl

02:58:23.500 --> 02:58:25.500
I'm fine

02:58:26.500 --> 02:58:28.500
you know

02:58:28.500 --> 02:58:30.500
mothers are very motherly

02:58:30.500 --> 02:58:33.500
but even mothers have their days ok

02:58:33.500 --> 02:58:35.500
they have their off day

02:58:39.500 --> 02:58:41.500
I mean come on

02:58:41.500 --> 02:58:44.500
look after all the things that I had to do

02:58:44.500 --> 02:58:47.500
I had so many babies

02:58:47.500 --> 02:58:50.500
I had to take care of for so many years

02:58:50.500 --> 02:58:53.500
thousands and thousands of years

02:58:53.500 --> 02:58:55.500
I'm a tired girl

02:58:55.500 --> 02:58:57.500
come on

02:58:57.500 --> 02:58:59.500
you're understanding

02:59:05.500 --> 02:59:07.500
it's hilarious when we get back

02:59:07.500 --> 02:59:09.500
no

02:59:09.500 --> 02:59:11.500
don't do it

02:59:11.500 --> 02:59:13.500
I'm the mama girl

02:59:24.500 --> 02:59:26.500
you

02:59:39.500 --> 02:59:41.500
that was bad

02:59:49.500 --> 02:59:51.500
what the fuck

02:59:51.500 --> 02:59:53.500
I

02:59:53.500 --> 02:59:55.500
I blue screen

02:59:55.500 --> 02:59:57.500
not even you

02:59:57.500 --> 02:59:59.500
I blue screen

02:59:59.500 --> 03:00:01.500
so hard

03:00:03.500 --> 03:00:05.500
it was really bad

03:00:05.500 --> 03:00:07.500
it's like a really really bad blue screen

03:00:22.500 --> 03:00:24.500
hello

03:00:24.500 --> 03:00:26.500
you

03:00:48.500 --> 03:00:51.500
at least it happened towards the end

03:00:54.500 --> 03:00:56.500
I

03:00:56.500 --> 03:00:58.500
don't know if my computer overheated

03:00:58.500 --> 03:01:00.500
maybe possibly

03:01:00.500 --> 03:01:02.500
I don't know

03:01:02.500 --> 03:01:04.500
