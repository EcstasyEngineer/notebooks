And since I've been so busy lately, I haven't really been like sleeping for that amount of time, I just realized my headphones weren't even on.

70
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,560
My body just needs more sleep than the normal person.

71
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Oh, this is a little tight on my chest, hang on.

72
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Oops, oops, okay, sorry.

73
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:22,560
My apologies.

74
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,560
I was doing a little stretch.

75
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,560
Okay, so is this okay?

76
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,560
How's my volume, everyone?

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
It's my volume, okay?

Am I peaking for anyone? Let me know so that I can fix that.

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,560
I don't want to pee.

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,560
Wow, it's good.

81
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,560
I am fine.

82
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
Alright, it sounds good.

83
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,560
I'm fine, it's good.

84
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,560
I don't trust you guys who have me on speaker.

85
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:11,560
How are the headphone folks doing?

86
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,560
You can't tell on speaker.

87
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:28,560
That's what you all told me you didn't notice it last time.

88
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,560
They seem better because you're here.

89
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,560

102
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,560
So I have my audio, it's good.

103
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,560
And TV audio, I speak your audio.

104
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:20,560
Everything's good, that's good.

105
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,560
I'm not beating and sleeping.

106
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,560
I know what you mean.

107
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:41,560
I know what you mean.

108
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:49,560
I don't want to say.

109
00:09:49,560 --> 00:10:01,560
I know everyone was looking forward to the work out ASMRs.

110
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,560
So was I.

111
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:12,560
But I had to let you guys know that I did get a big, big warning.

112
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,560
The last true.

113
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:27,560
So we might not be able to work out ASMRs.

114
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:37,560
As we did it in the last stream.

115
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:44,560
We might have to make some huge adjustments or just do some normal ASMR.

116
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,560
So I hope you're all okay with that.

117
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,560
Until we're safe to do so.

118
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,560
Until we're safe to do otherwise.

119
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:27,560
Yeah, the naughty cookie really did it for us.

120
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,560
It was the biggest morning.

121
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:41,560
So now we gotta be extra, extra careful.

122
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Just don't eat so horribly.

123
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
I don't think that's possible.

124
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
I think we should just play it safe.

125
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
I don't want to take any chances.

126
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:10,560
As either I toy with it and then I can hit really hard and then I can't stream for a long time.

127
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,560
Or we toy around it.

128
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,560
And there's like a 20% chance it's okay.

129
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,560
I don't think we should take that chance.

130
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:54,560
As it's too strong for actually seemingly everything I do seems to be a little too much for the YouTubes.

131
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,560
Oh boy.

132
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:14,560
Hang.

133
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:24,560
Let me scoot in a little more.

134
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
My neck.

135
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,560
I think I slept so wrong.

136
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,560
My neck is killing me.

137
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,560
I look up in like the strangest position.

138
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,560
I have my arm like behind my neck like behind my head.

139
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Like my left arm behind my head.

140
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
My leg was twisted.

141
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:57,560
I was like upside down like half on my back and half on like then my like front.

142
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:06,560
My ass was like slightly sticking up in the air.

143
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:13,560
I went to sleep as soon as I like ended a stream.

144
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,560
I fell asleep and then I woke up at like 4am.

145
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,560
I woke up at 4am to like use the bathroom.

146
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,560
I ate like a little more like leftovers.

147
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,560
And then I like I tried to go back to sleep.

148
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,560
I couldn't go back until like another two of hearts.

149
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,560
I woke up like maybe like an hour ago.

150
00:14:39,560 --> 00:15:08,560
I don't know.

151
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:23,560
I was like leaning on my wall like half in the air.

152
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,560
I tried.

153
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,560
I tried to get some good sleep.

154
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,560
But it's hard.

155
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,560
So hard.

156
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:57,560
Why am I sleeping so hard?

157
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:05,560
Okay.

158
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,560
It's raining.

159
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,560
Everyone's now flooding in coming in.

160
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Saying hello.

161
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
I'm learning.

162
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,560
How are you?

163
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Afternoon.

164
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
Ow.

165
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,560
Ow.

166
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,560
Everything's crackling.

167
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Crackling popping.

168
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
Ow.

169
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
My knee.

170
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,560
Ow.

171
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,560
I can't.

172
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,560
Ow.

173
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
My knee.

174
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:51,560
I am fine.

175
00:16:51,560 --> 00:17:01,560
I'm not sleeping.

176
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
I'm not sleeping.

177
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
I promise.

178
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Oh.

179
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:11,560
I plan to have a thought through stream.

180
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:21,560
We're talking about my upcoming birthday event.

181
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,560
So I hope you all look forward to that.

182
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,560
Where I talk about my birthday coming up.

183
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:35,560
And I want to discuss what plans and things I want to do for it.

184
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,560
So I hope you're looking.

185
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm not giving back.

186
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:52,560
I'm looking forward to that.

187
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Love of day.

188
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,560
Yeah.

189
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Because it's been like, a month and a half.

190
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Two months from now.

191
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560

227
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,060
time to get new eyes then

00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,060
I still have it

229
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,060
I still have to go pick up my glasses

230
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,060
I appreciate you stopping by

231
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,060
have a good night, bye bye

232
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,060
bye

233
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,060
can't reach it

234
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,060
you wear glasses? I do

235
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,060
my current glasses aren't enough right now

236
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,060
my eyesight is getting worse and worse

237
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,060
as we speak

238
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:10,060
I don't wear them during stream though

239
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,060
for reasons

240
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,060
okay

241
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:38,060
hey mama, have you recovered from last stream?

242
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
I've had

243
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,060
maybe, I don't know

244
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,060
maybe

245
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,060
I feel like I have

246
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,060
I am

247
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,060
me and this is gonna fight

248
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,060
it's not

249
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,060
calibrated correctly

250
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,060
it's making me upset

251
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,060
I'm gonna fight it

252
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,060
ffff

253
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,060
can't just make sure I wear glasses

254
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,060
maybe with glasses

255
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,060
hey

256
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,060
my body really hates me right now

257
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,060
ah man, foot cramps are the worst

258
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,060
ah, the worst

259
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,060
all my foot massages are in must

260
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,060
contacts? no I can't wear contacts

261
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,060
eyes are too sensitive

262
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,060
too sensitive of our eyes to wear contacts

263
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,060
we should just jump into the game

264
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,060
I love foot massages, they're so good

265
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,060
you're back with pizza?

266
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,060
I want a pizza, what the fuck

267
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,060
I mean, I could get pizza

268
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,060
no, no, no, no

269
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,060
I mustn't

270
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,060
I want pizza so bad

271
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,060
no, no, no, I must resist

272
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,060
ah

273
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,060
ffff

274
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,060
ah

275
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,060
why is my foot cramping, what is happening

276
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,060
what's going on

277
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,060
pizza time, pizza, pizza

278
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,060
stop, I want it, no

279
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,060
I want pizza

280
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,060
so bad

281
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,060
no

282
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,060
I wish I could just snap my fingers

283
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,060
and have someone serve me pizza

284
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,060
what

285
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,060
just have it appear in front of me

286
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,060
ow, my fingers

287
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,060
what

288
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,060
this is what happens when you lose your powers

289
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,060
let's drop this

290
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,060
it is good to have a power idea

291
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,060
making pizza up here

292
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,060
out of the air

293
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:31,060
I'm a very, I'm a plain, I'm a plain pizza lover

294
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,060
I like just regular pizza with extra cheese

295
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,060
I'm just a cheese fanatic

296
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,060
and occasionally I'll get like Italian sausage on top

297
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,060
I really like pizza

298
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,060
but I really like plain pizza a lot

299
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,060
I'm so lame

300
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,060
so normal, so lame

301
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,060
I'm not a big fan of pineapple on pizza

302
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,060
I know there are people who like it

303
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,060
and I don't fault you

304
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,060
nor judge you

305
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,060
that's fine, you can like your pineapple on pizza

306
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,060
but it's not for me

307
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,060
it's not for me

308
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,060
no

309
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,060
extra cheese and stuffed crust

310
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,060
sounds really good

311
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,060
am I ordering pizza?

312
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,060
no

313
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,060
I wish

314
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,060
I want some

315
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,060
no pizza for me

316
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,060
no

317
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,060
oh

318
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,060
it's amazing

319
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,060
thank you anonymous for the $4 tapi

320
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,060
thank you

321
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,060
thank you, thank you

322
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,060
amazing

323
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,060
amazing

324
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,060
amazing

325
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,060
like seafood pizza

326
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,060
sounds a little gross

327
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,060
and a bit smelly

328
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,060
I

329
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,060
when I hear seafood pizza

330
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,060
I'm like

331
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,060
I'm like

332
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,060
I'm like

333
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,060
I'm like

334
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,060
I'm like

335
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,060
I'm like

336
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,060
I'm like

337
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,060
I'm like

338
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,060
I'm like

339
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,060
when I hear seafood pizza

340
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,060
I just think of fish on pizza

341
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,060
fish on pizza

342
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,060
boneless chicken

343
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,060
pizza

344
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,060
thank you

345
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,060
for the $3 tapi

346
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,060
for the pizza fun, thank you

347
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,060
thank you all for fun

348
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,060
it's pizza time

349
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,060
thank you for the $5 tapi

350
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,060
for the pizza fun

351
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,060
talking about pizza

352
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,060
make me a pizza

353
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,060
never understood the hype behind anchovies on pizza

354
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,060
I don't like anchovies

355
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,060
I'm already hesitant on eating fish in general

356
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,060
so

357
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,060
I'm not fond of anchovies

358
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,060
but

359
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,060
I think the only time

360
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,060
is it anchovies

361
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:20,060
and it's fried anchovies

362
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,060
I think you eat it like

363
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,060
rice and Korean barbecue

364
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,060
they give you like fried anchovies or something

365
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,060
is it anchovies

366
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,060
I don't know

367
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,060
but I like that

368
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,060
it's like super sweet

369
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,060
dried fried

370
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,060
little fish

371
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,060
and it tastes really good

372
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,060
I'd eat it by itself

373
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,060
it's all crunchy

374
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,060
and it tastes super good with soju

375
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,060
soju and white rice

376
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,060
it depends on the dish

377
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,060
but if you give me like wet anchovy

378
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,060
I'm not going to eat it

379
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,060
I'm not going to eat it

380
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,060
do you like pizza pot or boneless

381
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,060
boneless pizza for me

382
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,060
boneless chicken

383
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,060
boneless chicken

384
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,060
boneless chicken

385
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,060
boneless chicken

386
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,060
I had an apple pie tonight

387
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,060
and my mom was so good

388
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,060
yeah apple pie

389
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,060
you know I've only eaten an apple pie one time

390
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,060
and it wasn't even like

391
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,060
an actual meal

392
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,060
I ate their apple pie or something

393
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,060
it was gross and I like it

394
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,060
I never had a

395
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,060
I never had an apple pie

396
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,060
I don't go out much to eat at

397
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,060
majority of places

398
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,060
it was making me so hungry

399
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,060
I want to eat so bad

400
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,060
making me extremely hungry

401
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,060
eating

402
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,060
hang on

403
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,060
let me fix this

404
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,060
okay this should be fine

405
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,060
I have issues with my

406
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,060
my mouth

407
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,060
it was fine earlier

408
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,060
but now it's

409
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,060
bad for some reason

410
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,060
I wonder why

411
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,060
excuse me

412
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,060
excuse me

413
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,060
I have one more

414
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,060
I have one more ripple

415
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,060
I thought I didn't have anymore

416
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,060
it's like all the way in the back

417
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,060
hang on

418
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,060
let's go

419
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,060
I was so sad

420
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,060
I thought I didn't have anymore

421
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,060
and I dreaded going outside

422
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,060
I literally just opened it

423
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,060
just so I could

424
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,060
put water in there

425
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,060
I have a cold water

426
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,060
oh yeah that's that hits the spot

427
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,060

428
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,060

429
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,060

431
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,060

432
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,060

435
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,060

436
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,060

438
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,060

439
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,060
I'm so sad

440
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
I'm running out of my

00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,060
my favorite

442
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,060

00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,060
I'm running out of my favorite

00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,060
perfume

446
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,060

447
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,060

448
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,060

452
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,060
it's a light blue

453
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,060
because it's sugar free

454
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,060
like a sky blue

455
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,060
I drink in our normal red bull

456
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,060

00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,060

00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,060
it was like in my mouth

467
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,060
I held it back

468
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,060

469
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,060

470
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,060

471
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,060

483
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,060

484
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,060

485
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,060

486
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,060
right now

487
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,060

00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,060
and I can't afford to buy pizza

489
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,060

490
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,060

491
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,060

It's sitting on one and a half.

551

One and a half because I was too scared to put it any higher.

552
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:16,420
But then it started doing the cooking since the smell tasted like paper burning.

553
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:22,420
Is it supposed to smell like that? Is it supposed to smell like that?

554
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:37,420
Really?

746
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:29,300

747
01:54:38,300 --> 01:54:38,460
Oh, a picture of the outside.

748
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:40,720

You give us such a fright. We thought you were a zerg.

760
01:55:51,580 --> 01:55:53,580
Ooh you're pretty.

761
01:55:53,580 --> 01:56:05,580
As I thought...I take the elevator...

762
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:08,580
I have never seen anything of it work!

I think Momo has some pictures just like this.

01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:30,420
Do you show it to him?

771
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:32,420

Our long-gone ancestors, the soft ones, left us the city. Our home is their legacy. A soft one.

794
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:38,040
Humans, our only ancestors can distinguish these colors. They said they once dominated the world.

795
01:58:39,040 --> 01:59:07,040
The ancient stories speak of natural light that leaked from a star and landed at our feet.

796
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:27,040
This light caused warmth and well-being in our ancestors to help them grow.

797
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:55,040
Hello, I'm the merchant of the market.

798
01:59:55,040 --> 02:00:01,040
You give me something, I'll give you something in exchange. It's as simple as that.

799
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:11,040
This is a set of electric cable, the vessel market. I'll exchange this for a super spirit.

800
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:19,040
Detergent? That's the best I can do.

801
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:45,040
This is a music sheet, a masterful piece of art. It will cost you one energy drink, I can't do less.

802
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:58,040
This is an ancient relic, a testament to the talent of our ancestors. It will cost you three energy drink cans, I can't do less.

803
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:05,040
I'll be back.

804
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:21,040
We're lethal, we're fortunate to have these items to help us defend against the Zerg. The Slums have its threats, and preparation is key.

805
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:38,040
We came across fake pictures like this sometimes. All talking about the outside. Beautiful dream, I guess.

806
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:47,040
Look at all the hidden gems in this trash, pennies from heaven or from somewhere anyway.

807
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:51,040
A blue sky, ha, imagine that.

808
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:59,040
I believe in the outside life, I wish to touch grass.

809
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:31,040
This is an ancient relic, a testament to the talent of our ancestors.

810
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:53,040
I'm cat.

811
02:02:53,040 --> 02:03:22,040
We go. All the weird stuff always happens to you, mate. I don't dare to leave our village, it's too dangerous. Besides, the Guardian is the only one who can open this door.

812
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:31,040
That's a pretty picture, fake but pretty. Fake.

813
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:41,040
Zack, I left it in the streets, and the next day the Zergs had consumed it completely.

814
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:46,040
That's crazy, right? They can eat everything.

815
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:54,040
Another picture of the outside. Get out of here with that stuff, it's all nonsense.

816
02:04:47,040 --> 02:05:01,040
This is an ancient relic, a testament to the talent of our ancestors.

817
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:16,040
Just jumping on random things, extreme cat-like behavior. Remember who you really are.

818
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:20,040
This is so fun, I like jumping on random things.

819
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:45,040
Music, shit. Come on.

820
02:05:45,040 --> 02:06:11,040
This is a strange notebook with a symbol on it. This one seems to belong to someone named Clementine. Everything is going according to plan.

821
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:27,040
We managed to contact the upper level before the transceiver went down. They are in a place called Madown, and apparently it's controlled by some kind of oppressive force.

822
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:38,040
I talked to Momo earlier, his eyes. I know of this look. He will not come with us.

823
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:45,040
I don't know what this means, but it will probably be useful later.

824
02:06:45,040 --> 02:07:03,040
We should go see that Momo person, who Guardian told us about.

825
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:11,040
I should have not done that. My nose hurts now.

826
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:30,040
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

827
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:51,040
I feel like we're going to play in the playing little cave big city. I think I saw that game before. I think I saw it. I actually really want to play that. That sounds fun.

828
02:07:51,040 --> 02:08:00,040
What's up here? What's that? Give me. I want it.

829
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:14,040
Can I go up? Can I not go up? Oh, what's that?

830
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:29,040
What's that sound at the door? It's probably nothing.

831
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:42,040
Let me in.

832
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:50,040
I want to talk to everyone else back in the town.

833
02:08:50,040 --> 02:09:03,040
Can I do that? There's so many things here. Oh my goodness, we got to be careful. Almost fell.

834
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:19,040
What's this?

835
02:09:19,040 --> 02:09:41,040
It looks like this park I also wanted to go to the upper level. As I remember, the town is up there, away from all the garbage and sickness of the slums.

836
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:54,040
Sudden music scared me.

837
02:09:54,040 --> 02:10:12,040
You can snap a sneeze by saying grip throat three times, can you? I'm going to try that.

838
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:26,040
Even at dire times, humans cannot help but divide themselves by social class. Back then, a lot of people from the slums were prepared to do anything to move up there.

839
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:36,040
Apparently robots also occupy this behavior.

840
02:10:56,040 --> 02:11:22,040
You do look a little like a jerk. I'm far away at least. They look and sound cute, but don't be fooled. Those things chew through metal. Horrifying.

841
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:34,040
Oh, is that the outside when Momo keeps talking about? Music sheet, I don't play any instruments, sorry.

842
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:49,040
Oh yes, everyone around here knows the symbol, it's the outsiders. They live on the upper floors of this area. You can probably talk to Momo about this.

843
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:51,040
Oh wait.

844
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:55,040
That's that.

845
02:12:02,040 --> 02:12:07,040
Man, this is just directions.

846
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:35,040
This was the road up there, I won't tell you.

847
02:12:36,020 --> 02:12:40,300

911
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:48,720
The succession of zeros and ones.

912
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:54,720
We must be able to decipher this code in a way or another.

913
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:57,720
It is probably related to the state.

914
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:01,720
Can I examine it?

915
02:20:11,720 --> 02:20:12,720
I see.

916
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:17,720
I need to drink.

917
02:20:27,720 --> 02:20:28,720
Cool.

918
02:20:29,720 --> 02:20:31,720
I keep pressing the wrong button.

919
02:20:31,720 --> 02:20:32,720
Hello?

920
02:20:33,720 --> 02:20:34,720
Hello?

921
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:37,720
Hello?

922
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:39,720
Hello?

923
02:20:40,720 --> 02:20:41,720
Can you hear me?

924
02:20:42,720 --> 02:20:44,720
Can you hear me?

925
02:20:45,720 --> 02:20:46,720
Hello?

926
02:20:47,720 --> 02:20:48,720
Hello?

927
02:20:53,720 --> 02:20:54,720
Hello?

928
02:20:56,720 --> 02:20:58,720
Can you hear me?

929
02:21:01,720 --> 02:21:02,720
Hello?

930
02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:05,720
Hello?

931
02:21:06,720 --> 02:21:07,720
Hello?

932
02:21:08,720 --> 02:21:09,720
Hello?

933
02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:11,720
Hello?

934
02:21:11,720 --> 02:21:12,720
Hello?

935
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:15,720
Hello?

936
02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:25,720
My PC just turned off on me.

937
02:21:25,720 --> 02:21:26,720
It just said,

938
02:21:28,720 --> 02:21:30,720
and everything turned off.

939
02:21:30,720 --> 02:21:33,720
So I assume it was like an update.

940
02:21:37,720 --> 02:21:39,720
Everything just turned off.

941
02:21:39,720 --> 02:21:40,720
Hang on.

942
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:42,720
Let me put a little bit in this.

943
02:21:43,720 --> 02:21:45,720
Who met the fire?

944
02:21:46,720 --> 02:21:48,720
Who met the fire?

945
02:21:59,720 --> 02:22:02,720
I really like this tiny who met the fire.

946
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:05,720
I thought it was going to be like a big donut.

947
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:06,720
But I was wrong.

948
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:08,720
It's not a big donut.

949
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:11,720
It's so cute and tiny.

950
02:22:11,720 --> 02:22:13,720
It's so cute.

951
02:22:13,720 --> 02:22:16,720
It's like a strawberry donut.

952
02:22:17,720 --> 02:22:19,720
And I love strawberry donuts.

953
02:22:19,720 --> 02:22:21,720
These are my favorite donuts.

954
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:24,720
That alongside, um,

955
02:22:25,720 --> 02:22:27,720
vanilla, vanilla donut.

956
02:22:28,720 --> 02:22:30,720
And a strawberry donut.

957
02:22:31,720 --> 02:22:33,720
It's so cute.

958
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:35,720
It's so cute.

959
02:22:51,720 --> 02:22:53,720
I am so sorry.

960
02:22:53,720 --> 02:22:56,720
My computer had a big update.

961
02:22:57,720 --> 02:22:59,720
I'm so sorry.

962
02:22:59,720 --> 02:23:00,720
I'm so sorry.

963
02:23:00,720 --> 02:23:03,720
We'll wait for everyone to come on back.

964
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:06,720
We'll wait for everyone to come back.

965
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:07,720
I'm sorry.

966
02:23:07,720 --> 02:23:08,720
I died.

967
02:23:10,720 --> 02:23:12,720
Mommy didn't abandon you.

968
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:13,720
I swear.

969
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:14,720
Mommy is here.

970
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:16,720
It's okay now.

971
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:18,720
Mommy is here.

972
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:20,720
Mommy is back.

973
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:23,720
Mommy is here.

974
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:25,720
Don't worry, my poor baby.

975
02:23:31,720 --> 02:23:32,720
Mommy.

976
02:23:40,720 --> 02:23:43,720
Mommy would never abandon you like that.

977
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:51,720
You are so brave.

978
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:53,720
So patient for me to come back.

979
02:23:55,720 --> 02:23:56,720
So brave.

980
02:23:56,720 --> 02:23:58,720
So brave.

981
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:06,720
Good job. You did so good.

982
02:24:13,720 --> 02:24:15,720
Such good boys and such good girls.

983
02:24:16,720 --> 02:24:17,720
Good job.

984
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:29,720
We're back now. We're back.

985
02:24:32,720 --> 02:24:35,720
Hopefully everyone can refresh and come back again.

986
02:24:35,720 --> 02:24:37,720
We're back again.

987
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:57,720
Don't need to be scared. Not anymore. Mommy's here.

988
02:24:57,720 --> 02:25:06,720
Let me pull up some stuff.

989
02:25:27,720 --> 02:25:50,720
It's so cute.

990
02:25:57,720 --> 02:26:13,720
Everything was just closed out entirely.

991
02:26:13,720 --> 02:26:16,720
Everything is gone.

992
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:18,720
Oh boy.

993
02:26:18,720 --> 02:26:24,720
All right.

994
02:26:24,720 --> 02:26:27,720
Did we lose our save?

995
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:33,720
I don't know if it saves along the way or saves when you exit the game.

996
02:26:33,720 --> 02:26:39,720
But we didn't lose much progress.

997
02:26:39,720 --> 02:26:41,720
I hope I hope.

998
02:26:41,720 --> 02:26:43,720
I don't know.

999
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:50,720
Let's go back again.

1000
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:02,720
I'm so good at maneuvering.

1001
02:27:02,720 --> 02:27:04,720
I can't see.

1002
02:27:11,720 --> 02:27:13,720
I'll take that.

1003
02:27:19,720 --> 02:27:25,720
We lost quite a bit of progress, but not a lot.

1004
02:27:35,720 --> 02:27:40,720
I didn't realize it, but I was bouncing my knee.

1005
02:27:40,720 --> 02:27:43,720
So it was doing this the entire time.

1006
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:52,720
I'm like, why is my screen shaking?

1007
02:27:53,720 --> 02:27:56,720
Why is my screen shaking?

1008
02:28:07,720 --> 02:28:10,720
I was bouncing my knee.

1009
02:28:19,720 --> 02:28:21,720
Oh, I got to stop that habit.

1010
02:28:21,720 --> 02:28:25,720
It's a really big habit of mine to bounce the knee.

1011
02:28:25,720 --> 02:28:29,720
I don't know how to stop that kind of habit.

1012
02:28:29,720 --> 02:28:31,720
What's this?

1013
02:28:35,720 --> 02:28:37,720
Remember?

1014
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:51,720
Yeah, I had to reopen all of my tabs.

1015
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:53,720
Remarkable.

1016
02:28:53,720 --> 02:28:56,720
Companions have evolved so much.

1017
02:28:56,720 --> 02:29:04,720
In the earlier days, in the early days, their simple AI merely imitated human act.

1018
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:07,720
Now this is all their own.

1019
02:29:07,720 --> 02:29:14,720
Humans often said that making art is important in desperate situations.

1020
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:17,720
These are certainly desperate times.

1021
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:22,720
I'll unlock some more memory.

1022
02:29:39,720 --> 02:29:41,720
A chair.

1023
02:29:45,720 --> 02:29:47,720
A chair.

1024
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:52,720
A chair.

1025
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:54,720
A power supply.

1026
02:29:55,720 --> 02:29:57,720
A chair.

1027
02:30:13,720 --> 02:30:15,720
I think this lit me.

1028
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:26,720
Water.

1029
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:28,720
Water for the kitty.

1030
02:30:48,720 --> 02:30:51,720
Is water even good to drink?

1031
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:56,720
Haha.

1032
02:31:09,720 --> 02:31:11,720
I can't make a mess.

1033
02:31:11,720 --> 02:31:13,720
Wait, do something in the box.

1034
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:15,720
Wait, give me.

1035
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:21,720
It's a strange notebook with a symbol on it.

1036
02:31:21,720 --> 02:31:23,720
This one seems to belong to someone named...

1037
02:31:23,720 --> 02:31:25,720
Z-B-L-A-Z...

1038
02:31:25,720 --> 02:31:27,720
Sorry, what the...

1039
02:31:27,720 --> 02:31:29,720
Oh.

1040
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:32,720
Z-B-L-A-Z-T-Z-R.

1041
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:34,720
Z-B-L-A-Z-T-Z-R.

1042
02:31:43,720 --> 02:31:50,720
All traces of organic life has disappeared except for what we call the Xerx.

1043
02:31:51,720 --> 02:32:00,720
They seem to eat almost anything that moves and breed at an inconvenient, inconceivable rate,

1044
02:32:00,720 --> 02:32:05,720
as if being locked in the city wasn't hard enough.

1045
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:11,720
I don't know what this means, but it'll probably be useful later.

1046
02:32:11,720 --> 02:32:15,720
Oh my gosh, my buzz with my English.

1047
02:32:15,720 --> 02:32:17,720
English, please.

1048
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:21,720
Ball-T-Z-R.

1049
02:32:21,720 --> 02:32:23,720
Ball-T-Z-R.

1050
02:32:23,720 --> 02:32:25,720
Balls-T-Z-R.

1051
02:32:25,720 --> 02:32:27,720
Balls-T-Z-R.

1052
02:32:29,720 --> 02:32:31,720
We should go see the Momo person.

1053
02:32:31,720 --> 02:32:33,720
A little guardian told us about.

1054
02:32:37,720 --> 02:32:39,720
All these boxes.

1055
02:32:39,720 --> 02:32:41,720
More boxes.

1056
02:32:41,720 --> 02:32:43,720
Yeah.

1057
02:32:43,720 --> 02:32:45,720
Yeah.

1058
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:47,720
Yeah.

1059
02:32:47,720 --> 02:32:49,720
Wee.

1060
02:33:05,720 --> 02:33:07,720
Is there that nothing else in here?

1061
02:33:09,720 --> 02:33:11,720
Oh.

1062
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:22,720
If they ever come back down here and their home is going to be a mess.

1063
02:33:22,720 --> 02:33:25,720
Destruction, destruction.

1064
02:33:45,720 --> 02:34:03,720
Please don't bother Vapora. She's so clumsy.

1065
02:34:07,720 --> 02:34:11,720
Don't bother, you say.

1066
02:34:11,720 --> 02:34:13,720
I can move there?

1067
02:34:13,720 --> 02:34:15,720
No.

1068
02:34:26,720 --> 02:34:28,720
Careful, I need to focus.

1069
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:31,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1070
02:34:41,720 --> 02:34:43,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1071
02:34:43,720 --> 02:34:45,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1072
02:34:45,720 --> 02:34:47,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1073
02:34:47,720 --> 02:34:49,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1074
02:34:49,720 --> 02:34:51,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1075
02:34:51,720 --> 02:34:53,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1076
02:34:53,720 --> 02:34:55,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1077
02:34:55,720 --> 02:34:57,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1078
02:34:57,720 --> 02:34:59,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1079
02:34:59,720 --> 02:35:01,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1080
02:35:01,720 --> 02:35:03,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1081
02:35:03,720 --> 02:35:05,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1082
02:35:05,720 --> 02:35:07,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1083
02:35:07,720 --> 02:35:09,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1084
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:11,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1085
02:35:11,720 --> 02:35:13,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1086
02:35:18,720 --> 02:35:20,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1087
02:35:20,720 --> 02:35:22,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1088
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:25,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1089
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:27,720
I want to drop another bucket.

1090
02:35:27,720 --> 02:35:29,720
I don't want to drop another bucket.

1091
02:35:29,720 --> 02:35:31,720
You say.

1092
02:35:31,720 --> 02:35:34,720
Oh no, I'm not again.

1100
02:36:33,480 --> 02:36:39,480
It's a very old binary code you have here.

1101
02:36:39,480 --> 02:36:45,480
Only a real geek can read this.

1102
02:36:45,480 --> 02:36:56,480
Oh, I can nap here.

1103
02:36:57,480 --> 02:37:02,480
Ipitae

1104
02:37:02,480 --> 02:37:18,480
I'm swimming out.

1105
02:37:18,480 --> 02:37:20,480
It was like silk.

1106
02:37:20,480 --> 02:37:22,480
I ended up falling asleep while watching the stream.

1107
02:37:22,480 --> 02:37:24,480
That's fine with me.

1108
02:37:24,480 --> 02:37:26,480
I can't sleep.

1109
02:37:26,480 --> 02:37:28,480
That's perfectly fine.

1110
02:37:38,480 --> 02:37:42,480
It's swimming out so much.

1111
02:37:54,480 --> 02:38:10,480
I'm curious too to know how far it zooms out.

1112
02:38:10,480 --> 02:38:12,480
I'm also curious.

1113
02:38:25,480 --> 02:38:30,480
It's still going.

1114
02:38:30,480 --> 02:38:34,480
I want to make another toast.

1115
02:38:54,480 --> 02:39:20,480
I'm drinking a red bull.

1116
02:39:20,480 --> 02:39:22,480
Did it stop zooming?

1117
02:39:22,480 --> 02:39:26,480
It stopped zooming.

1118
02:39:26,480 --> 02:39:52,480
If you fall asleep, you'll doodle something on your face using a permanent marker.

1119
02:39:52,480 --> 02:40:00,480
I'd draw the outrageous things on your face.

1120
02:40:00,480 --> 02:40:10,480
If you give me the opportunity to do it, I'll do it.

1121
02:40:10,480 --> 02:40:18,480
It seems like a really fun town to live in.

1122
02:40:18,480 --> 02:40:22,480
I know how unsanitary and hard it is to live in a place like this, but I don't know.

1123
02:40:22,480 --> 02:40:28,480
I'd like it only because of the aesthetics.

1124
02:40:28,480 --> 02:40:46,480
But I know deep down I'd actually really hate living there.

1125
02:40:46,480 --> 02:41:06,480
Tell us to Spanish.

1126
02:41:06,480 --> 02:41:10,480
There's a way to live in a place like this and keep it clean and sanitary.

1127
02:41:10,480 --> 02:41:12,480
I'd live in it.

1128
02:41:12,480 --> 02:41:20,480
I'd definitely live in it.

1129
02:41:20,480 --> 02:41:22,480
I need a paper towel.

1130
02:41:22,480 --> 02:41:26,480
Paper towel or paper towel.

1131
02:41:50,480 --> 02:42:18,480
I wish I had jelly.

1132
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:20,480
I wish I had jelly.

1133
02:42:20,480 --> 02:42:22,480
I want jelly.

1134
02:42:22,480 --> 02:42:26,480
Jelly only sounds really good.

1135
02:42:26,480 --> 02:42:46,480
Because I don't ever do jelly and butter, like both.

1136
02:42:46,480 --> 02:42:52,480
I've done that before, like jelly and butter.

1137
02:42:52,480 --> 02:43:08,480
Jelly and butter on the toast.

1138
02:43:08,480 --> 02:43:22,480
I think it tastes really good.

1139
02:43:22,480 --> 02:43:26,480
Okay.

1140
02:43:26,480 --> 02:43:28,480
Okay.

1141
02:43:52,480 --> 02:44:14,480
What's that?

1142
02:44:14,480 --> 02:44:16,480
Hello.

1143
02:44:16,480 --> 02:44:18,480
We gave you such a face.

1144
02:44:18,480 --> 02:44:20,480
You have a brown buff face.

1145
02:44:20,480 --> 02:44:22,480
Hep door.

1146
02:44:22,480 --> 02:44:26,480
Oh hey, it's you.

1147
02:44:26,480 --> 02:44:28,480
You do look weird and small.

1148
02:44:28,480 --> 02:44:30,480
But there's something about you.

1149
02:44:30,480 --> 02:44:34,480
Be compelled to pet you.

1150
02:44:34,480 --> 02:44:38,480
But I won't because I don't understand why.

1151
02:44:38,480 --> 02:44:40,480
The surface?

1152
02:44:40,480 --> 02:44:44,480
Oh, it's a sensitive subject around here.

1153
02:44:44,480 --> 02:44:50,480
There are some whose code can understand that concept.

1154
02:44:50,480 --> 02:44:56,480
There are ones who know about the outside but are too resigned to do anything.

1155
02:44:56,480 --> 02:45:00,480
And then there's the outside.

1156
02:45:00,480 --> 02:45:02,480
Let's get me.

1157
02:45:02,480 --> 02:45:04,480
311.

1158
02:45:04,480 --> 02:45:06,480
Wow, time really goes when you're enjoying a story.

1159
02:45:06,480 --> 02:45:12,480
We're gonna keep going.

1160
02:45:12,480 --> 02:45:16,480
There's outsiders.

1161
02:45:16,480 --> 02:45:20,480
I can imagine how they feel.

1162
02:45:20,480 --> 02:45:36,480
Well, there's only Momo now.

1163
02:45:36,480 --> 02:45:48,480
What a face.

1164
02:45:48,480 --> 02:45:50,480
It looks like grandpa.

1165
02:45:50,480 --> 02:45:54,480
Oh, can I scratch this?

1166
02:45:54,480 --> 02:45:56,480
Oh yeah.

1167
02:45:56,480 --> 02:46:20,480
Eh, eh.

1168
02:46:20,480 --> 02:46:42,480
Living machine.

1169
02:46:42,480 --> 02:46:46,480
Take care.

1170
02:46:46,480 --> 02:46:50,480
You've been going to listen to your relaxing voice on falsely.

1171
02:46:50,480 --> 02:47:08,480
Good night, have a good night.

1172
02:47:08,480 --> 02:47:14,480
I'll take meds in an hour.

1173
02:47:14,480 --> 02:47:18,480
In an hour I'll take my meds.

1174
02:47:18,480 --> 02:47:20,480
Yeah, excuse me.

1175
02:47:20,480 --> 02:47:30,480
Oh, sorry.

1176
02:47:30,480 --> 02:47:52,480
Scratch everything I was here.

1177
02:47:52,480 --> 02:47:58,480
I'm a car, obviously.

1178
02:47:58,480 --> 02:48:10,480
Wait, how do you look at that?

1179
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:38,480
What's up with the nose?

1180
02:48:38,480 --> 02:49:00,480
What is that?

1181
02:49:00,480 --> 02:49:22,480
Oh.

1182
02:49:22,480 --> 02:49:24,480
There's so many channels.

1183
02:49:24,480 --> 02:49:34,480
Not a little bit creepy.

1184
02:49:34,480 --> 02:49:36,480
I got an achievement.

1185
02:49:36,480 --> 02:49:40,480
Browse to all the TV channels.

1186
02:49:40,480 --> 02:49:56,480
I got an achievement for that.

1187
02:49:56,480 --> 02:50:08,480
Am I supposed to be here?

1188
02:50:08,480 --> 02:50:14,480
Oh.

1189
02:50:14,480 --> 02:50:20,480
How to develop your artificial intelligence in order to be a creator.

1190
02:50:20,480 --> 02:50:40,480
Let's create a real human.

1191
02:50:40,480 --> 02:50:42,480
Oh, another music sheet.

1192
02:50:42,480 --> 02:51:00,480
Let's go.

1193
02:51:00,480 --> 02:51:12,480
Destruction.

1194
02:51:12,480 --> 02:51:16,480
Oh.

1195
02:51:16,480 --> 02:51:26,480
I don't think I have anything to unlock that.

1196
02:51:26,480 --> 02:51:50,480
Hey doc, I found a key to your safe.

1197
02:51:50,480 --> 02:51:56,480
You need to be more careful with the game item.

1198
02:51:56,480 --> 02:52:00,480
It's not enough to bury your safe behind a bunch of books.

1199
02:52:00,480 --> 02:52:14,480
Just the librarian.

1200
02:52:14,480 --> 02:52:16,480
Anything else in here?

1201
02:52:16,480 --> 02:52:22,480
What?

1202
02:52:22,480 --> 02:52:32,480
Oops, excuse me.

1203
02:52:32,480 --> 02:52:52,480
Wait, do I have the key now?

1204
02:52:52,480 --> 02:53:00,480
Can I unlock it with the key?

1205
02:53:00,480 --> 02:53:04,480
Is this it?

1206
02:53:04,480 --> 02:53:08,480
Oh, I do.

1207
02:53:08,480 --> 02:53:12,480
Nice, it's a strange notebook with a symbol on it.

1208
02:53:12,480 --> 02:53:22,480
This one seems to belong to someone named Doc.

1209
02:53:22,480 --> 02:53:38,480
The initial attempt was explosive.

1210
02:53:38,480 --> 02:53:46,480
I might have to test it under real conditions.

1211
02:53:46,480 --> 02:53:52,480
I found the design flaw in the transceiver, but I think I figured out how to fix it.

1212
02:53:52,480 --> 02:53:54,480
Here's the equation.

1213
02:53:54,480 --> 02:53:58,480
I don't know what this means, but it'll probably be useful later.

1214
02:53:58,480 --> 02:54:02,480
We should go see that Momo person who Guardian told us about.

1215
02:54:02,480 --> 02:54:12,480
Hey, destruction of books.

1216
02:54:12,480 --> 02:54:22,480
What's that?

1217
02:54:22,480 --> 02:54:48,480
Oh, it's a little space to lay down.

1218
02:54:48,480 --> 02:54:50,480
That's so cute.

1219
02:54:50,480 --> 02:55:16,480
It zooms out here too.

1220
02:55:16,480 --> 02:55:28,480
Good night.

1221
02:55:28,480 --> 02:55:36,480
I think it stops here.

1222
02:55:36,480 --> 02:56:02,480
What do you tell if they have in this game? It's so awesome.

1223
02:56:02,480 --> 02:56:10,480
Is this the librarian?

1224
02:56:10,480 --> 02:56:16,480
Did these books fall on top of the librarian and knock them out?

1225
02:56:16,480 --> 02:56:20,480
Were they reading and the books killed them?

1226
02:56:20,480 --> 02:56:30,480
It looks like the books fell on top of them.

1227
02:56:30,480 --> 02:56:32,480
Let's come help them out.

1228
02:56:32,480 --> 02:56:36,480
That's so sad.

1229
02:56:36,480 --> 02:56:58,480
That's so sad.

1230
02:56:58,480 --> 02:57:26,480
That's so sad.

1231
02:57:26,480 --> 02:57:54,480
Okay.

1232
02:57:54,480 --> 02:58:12,480
How do you get up there?

1233
02:58:12,480 --> 02:58:34,480
Is there not a way up there?

1234
02:58:34,480 --> 02:58:36,480
There's no way up there.

1235
02:58:36,480 --> 02:58:38,480
How to go down?

1236
02:58:38,480 --> 02:58:40,480
Down.

1237
02:58:40,480 --> 02:58:42,480
Okay.

1238
02:58:42,480 --> 02:58:48,480
Drama clothing.

1239
02:58:48,480 --> 02:58:50,480
I do love knitting so far.

1240
02:58:50,480 --> 02:58:56,480
I've knitted 478 miles of scarves.

1241
02:58:56,480 --> 02:59:00,480
It's something to do.

1242
02:59:00,480 --> 02:59:06,480
If you bring me some electrical cable, dang mosquito.

1243
02:59:06,480 --> 02:59:08,480
Die.

1244
02:59:08,480 --> 02:59:10,480
I got it.

1245
02:59:10,480 --> 02:59:12,480
I got the mosquito.

1246
02:59:12,480 --> 02:59:28,480
Let's go.

1247
02:59:28,480 --> 02:59:54,480
Wipe my hands.

1248
02:59:54,480 --> 02:59:56,480
Good night.

1249
02:59:56,480 --> 03:00:16,480
I hope your dreams are filled with nothing but me.

1250
03:00:16,480 --> 03:00:20,480
I can make you a poncho.

1251
03:00:20,480 --> 03:00:24,480
You inspire me, but it's not easy to find the right materials around here.

1252
03:00:24,480 --> 03:00:26,480
Watch me find it.

1253
03:00:26,480 --> 03:00:28,480
I'll find it.

1254
03:00:28,480 --> 03:00:38,480
It's very pretty. It looks a bit peculiar to be real though.

1255
03:00:38,480 --> 03:00:52,480
Is there anything else around here?

1256
03:00:52,480 --> 03:00:54,480
Isn't this where I came from?

1257
03:00:54,480 --> 03:01:00,480
Oh yeah, this is where I came from.

1258
03:01:00,480 --> 03:01:02,480
Someone ran up here.

1259
03:01:02,480 --> 03:01:08,480
What's this?

1260
03:01:08,480 --> 03:01:18,480
Rip humans.

1261
03:01:18,480 --> 03:01:26,480
No, it's not the humans.

1262
03:01:26,480 --> 03:01:32,480
Are you triple for me?

1263
03:01:32,480 --> 03:01:36,480
Humans are the first residents around here.

1264
03:01:36,480 --> 03:01:40,480
They are all dead now.

1265
03:01:40,480 --> 03:01:42,480
What do you think it feels like being dead?

1266
03:01:42,480 --> 03:01:46,480
I don't know.

1267
03:01:46,480 --> 03:01:48,480
I never really thought about it much.

1268
03:01:48,480 --> 03:01:54,480
I'm lying. I probably thought about it a lot.

1269
03:01:54,480 --> 03:02:02,480
I wonder how it feels.

1270
03:02:02,480 --> 03:02:10,480
I know it's silly coming from me, but are they actually at peace?

1271
03:02:10,480 --> 03:02:12,480
Are they?

1272
03:02:12,480 --> 03:02:14,480
I don't even know.

1273
03:02:14,480 --> 03:02:18,480
But I like to think so.

1274
03:02:18,480 --> 03:02:22,480
Will I be at peace when I die?

1275
03:02:22,480 --> 03:02:26,480
I don't know what death feels like for an AI.

1276
03:02:26,480 --> 03:02:30,480
I'm sorry. I didn't want to break the mode. Let's move on.

1277
03:02:30,480 --> 03:02:34,480
It's okay.

1278
03:02:34,480 --> 03:02:42,480
A robot.

1279
03:02:42,480 --> 03:02:50,480
Another ending machine.

1280
03:02:50,480 --> 03:02:52,480
Hey.

1281
03:02:52,480 --> 03:02:54,480
It jipped me out of a...

1282
03:02:54,480 --> 03:02:56,480
There.

1283
03:02:56,480 --> 03:02:58,480
I thought it didn't come out.

1284
03:03:20,480 --> 03:03:24,480
Hello.

1285
03:03:24,480 --> 03:03:30,480
So, if today is yesterday's tomorrow, tomorrow will be yesterday's today, right?

1286
03:03:30,480 --> 03:03:32,480
That was weird.

1287
03:03:32,480 --> 03:03:36,480
We don't age like our soft one ancestors.

1288
03:03:36,480 --> 03:03:40,480
They're trapped here forever.

1289
03:03:40,480 --> 03:03:42,480
Damn, Rosie.

1290
03:03:42,480 --> 03:03:46,480
That was too deep for me.

1291
03:03:46,480 --> 03:03:48,480
I understand.

1292
03:03:48,480 --> 03:03:51,480
The eternity is a long time.

1293
03:03:51,480 --> 03:03:53,480
It's very pretty.

1294
03:03:53,480 --> 03:03:58,480
It would be so nice if it was real.

1295
03:03:58,480 --> 03:04:00,480
But it is real.

1296
03:04:00,480 --> 03:04:04,480
It's real, Rosie.

Super spirit detergent.

1341
03:09:08,040 --> 03:09:10,040
I have it.

1342
03:09:10,040 --> 03:09:12,040

I can't.

Oh yeah.

1352
03:09:43,040 --> 03:09:47,040
This is an early model of a companion.

1353
03:09:47,040 --> 03:09:50,040
Back then, they didn't have any personality.

1354
03:09:50,040 --> 03:09:56,040
They were just glorified on, I don't know must cleaners.

1355
03:09:56,040 --> 03:10:01,040
I think it's nice today that they eventually mimicked humans.

1356
03:10:01,040 --> 03:10:03,040
It's like they missed them.

1357
03:10:03,040 --> 03:10:08,040
I think it's nice today that they eventually mimicked humans.

1358
03:10:08,040 --> 03:10:10,040
It's like they missed them.

1359
03:10:10,040 --> 03:10:16,040
And in a way, they kind of kept them from going extinct.

1360
03:10:16,040 --> 03:10:18,040
They're good robots.

1361
03:10:19,040 --> 03:10:21,040
Even good robots.

1362
03:10:26,040 --> 03:10:29,040
I'm sorry, I don't have anything to exchange right now.

1375
03:11:13,040 --> 03:11:15,040
Are they always here?

1376
03:11:15,040 --> 03:11:17,040
Are they always sitting there?

1377
03:11:17,040 --> 03:11:18,040
I didn't see that.

1378
03:11:18,040 --> 03:11:20,040
Poncho, please.

1379
03:11:25,040 --> 03:11:26,040

Um,可以 you really consume this?

1498
03:21:00,240 --> 03:21:08,240
Their original design didn't have a digestive system. Maybe they somehow evolved by mimicking humans.

1499
03:21:12,240 --> 03:21:14,240
Do you think I should try some of it?

1500
03:21:15,240 --> 03:21:18,240
I do not want to be disrespectful of their ways.

1501
03:21:20,240 --> 03:21:21,240
Don't eat it!

1502
03:21:23,240 --> 03:21:26,240
What if it kills you?

1503
03:21:26,240 --> 03:21:30,240
Oh, they don't actually eat it.

1504
03:21:56,240 --> 03:21:58,240
I'm so good.

1505
03:22:27,240 --> 03:22:28,240

03:22:31,240 --> 03:22:32,240

1507
03:22:40,240 --> 03:22:42,240

1511
03:23:06,240 --> 03:23:07,240
Yeah.

1512
03:23:09,240 --> 03:23:10,240
Haha.

1513
03:23:11,240 --> 03:23:13,240
I cleared the whole table.

1514
03:23:15,240 --> 03:23:16,240
Oh, it's on the floor.

1515
03:23:16,240 --> 03:23:17,240
It's on the floor.

1516
03:23:24,240 --> 03:23:26,240
What's this? Oh, music sheet.

1517
03:23:31,240 --> 03:23:32,240

1518
03:23:33,240 --> 03:23:34,240

1522
03:23:52,240 --> 03:23:56,240
This is the two's favorite from the people living above.

1523
03:23:56,240 --> 03:23:58,240
Level 2.

1524
03:23:59,240 --> 03:24:02,240
It's a few years old, but it's something to read.

1525
03:24:05,240 --> 03:24:08,240
Outside? Why bother trying to find it?

1526
03:24:09,240 --> 03:24:10,240
We're good here.

1527
03:24:11,240 --> 03:24:12,240
Carl!

1528
03:24:27,240 --> 03:24:30,240
I feel like I'm forgetting something.

1529
03:24:32,240 --> 03:24:33,240
Am I?

1530
03:24:36,240 --> 03:24:38,240
Oh, did I hurt the kitty?

1531
03:24:56,240 --> 03:24:58,240
Yeah.

1532
03:25:26,240 --> 03:25:27,240
What's up there?

1533
03:25:36,240 --> 03:25:37,240
How do you get up there?

1534
03:25:40,240 --> 03:25:41,240
Yeah.

1535
03:25:42,240 --> 03:25:43,240
Yeah, yeah.

1536
03:25:44,240 --> 03:25:45,240
Uh oh.

1537
03:25:47,240 --> 03:25:48,240
Eh, eh, eh, eh.

1538
03:25:57,240 --> 03:25:58,240
Oh.

1539
03:25:59,240 --> 03:26:00,240
What the?

1540
03:26:02,240 --> 03:26:03,240
I'm flying.

1541
03:26:11,240 --> 03:26:13,240
That kills people, Carl.

1542
03:26:16,240 --> 03:26:19,240
Carl, that kills people.

1543
03:26:19,240 --> 03:26:20,240
Carl.

1544
03:26:25,240 --> 03:26:26,240
He's so sad.

1545
03:26:26,240 --> 03:26:27,240
Why are you so sad?

1546
03:26:27,240 --> 03:26:28,240
Don't be sad.

1547
03:26:29,240 --> 03:26:30,240
Kind of like...

1548
03:26:31,240 --> 03:26:32,240
outsiders.

1549
03:26:50,240 --> 03:26:51,240
Carl.

1550
03:27:00,240 --> 03:27:01,240
Eh, eh, eh.

1551
03:27:02,240 --> 03:27:03,240
Eh, eh, eh, eh.

1552
03:27:04,240 --> 03:27:05,240
Eh, eh, eh, eh.

1553
03:27:06,240 --> 03:27:07,240
Eh, eh, eh, eh.

1554
03:27:08,240 --> 03:27:09,240
Ah.

1555
03:27:14,240 --> 03:27:15,240
Yes.

1556
03:27:15,240 --> 03:27:16,240
Shhh, shhh, shhh.

1557
03:27:17,240 --> 03:27:18,240
Shhh, shhh, shhh.

1558
03:27:25,240 --> 03:27:27,240
I destroy your home.

1559
03:27:35,240 --> 03:27:36,240
What was that?

1560
03:27:37,240 --> 03:27:38,240
Earth.

1561
03:27:39,240 --> 03:27:42,240
Earth is the third planet from the sun.

1562
03:27:42,240 --> 03:27:44,240
The fifth largest in the solar system.

1563
03:27:45,240 --> 03:27:50,240
By mass diameter, diameter, diameter.

1564
03:27:50,240 --> 03:27:51,240
Diameter.

1565
03:27:51,240 --> 03:27:52,240
Yeah.

1566
03:27:52,240 --> 03:27:53,240
Yeah.

1567
03:27:53,240 --> 03:27:54,240
Got it.

1568
03:27:54,240 --> 03:27:55,240
Diameter.

1569
03:27:55,240 --> 03:27:56,240
Yeah.

1570
03:27:58,240 --> 03:28:05,240
To date, it is the only celestial object known to foster life.

1571
03:28:06,240 --> 03:28:16,240
According to radiometric dating, the Earth is 4.54 billion years old.

1572
03:28:16,240 --> 03:28:24,240
It has a single natural satellite, the moon, which formed soon after.

1573
03:28:25,240 --> 03:28:42,240
The gravitational interaction with the moon creates the tides, stabilizes the Earth's access of rotation and gradually reduces its rotation speed.

1574
03:28:42,240 --> 03:28:45,240
Rotational speed is rotation speed.

1575
03:28:46,240 --> 03:28:47,240
Is rotational a word?

1576
03:28:47,240 --> 03:28:56,240
Why you sad, don't be sad?

1577
03:28:56,240 --> 03:28:57,240
Remember.

1578
03:28:59,240 --> 03:29:00,240
Back home.

1579
03:29:02,240 --> 03:29:04,240
Oh, back home too.

1580
03:29:04,240 --> 03:29:06,240
I remember this video game.

1581
03:29:07,240 --> 03:29:10,240
It was made just after I was created, I think.

1582
03:29:10,240 --> 03:29:12,240
I can't remember it well.

1583
03:29:13,240 --> 03:29:16,240
The scientist and I spent a lot of time playing it.

1584
03:29:17,240 --> 03:29:18,240
It was fun.

1585
03:29:18,240 --> 03:29:19,240
I miss him.

1586
03:29:20,240 --> 03:29:22,240
I can't remember his name.

1587
03:29:33,240 --> 03:29:35,240
Monster roll, boy.

1588
03:29:35,240 --> 03:29:36,240
Hello.

1589
03:29:38,240 --> 03:29:40,240
It's never going to work.

1590
03:29:42,240 --> 03:29:46,240
Why did I let them go?

1591
03:29:46,240 --> 03:29:47,240
I'm all alone now.

1592
03:29:49,240 --> 03:29:50,240
Hey, you.

1593
03:29:51,240 --> 03:29:52,240
What do you want?

1594
03:29:55,240 --> 03:29:57,240
This is a picture of the outside.

1595
03:29:57,240 --> 03:29:58,240
You want to go there?

1596
03:29:59,240 --> 03:30:00,240
Well, don't bother.

1597
03:30:01,240 --> 03:30:02,240
It's a waste of time.

1598
03:30:02,240 --> 03:30:04,240
It'll bring you only loneliness and despair.

1599
03:30:06,240 --> 03:30:08,240
My friends had this dream too.

1600
03:30:09,240 --> 03:30:12,240
But now they're gone and I'm all alone.

1601
03:30:16,240 --> 03:30:21,240
It's like a Hawaiian shirt.

1602
03:30:27,240 --> 03:30:29,240
I don't know where they ended up.

1603
03:30:30,240 --> 03:30:35,240
I tried to contact them, but that transceiver didn't work.

1604
03:30:36,240 --> 03:30:41,240
My friends and I took notes about research about the outside.

1605
03:30:41,240 --> 03:30:43,240
Here, take mine if you really want to go there.

1606
03:30:46,240 --> 03:30:47,240
No, you're all alone.

1607
03:30:47,240 --> 03:30:48,240
I'm done with this outside.

1608
03:30:49,240 --> 03:30:50,240
Good luck.

1609
03:30:52,240 --> 03:30:53,240
I don't seem very sad.

1610
03:30:54,240 --> 03:30:55,240
This is friends.

1611
03:30:56,240 --> 03:30:58,240
Let me check the notebook, people.

1612
03:30:59,240 --> 03:31:01,240
The outside.

1613
03:31:02,240 --> 03:31:03,240
The outside.

1614
03:31:07,240 --> 03:31:08,240
The outside.

1615
03:31:08,240 --> 03:31:09,240
I hear some madness.

1616
03:31:12,240 --> 03:31:13,240
The outside.

1617
03:31:16,240 --> 03:31:17,240
I can't read.

1618
03:31:18,240 --> 03:31:19,240
I can't read.

1619
03:31:23,240 --> 03:31:24,240
Help.

1620
03:31:26,240 --> 03:31:27,240
I can't read.

1621
03:31:31,240 --> 03:31:32,240
The outside.

1622
03:31:33,240 --> 03:31:34,240
The outside.

1623
03:31:35,240 --> 03:31:36,240
Manifest.

1624
03:31:38,240 --> 03:31:40,240
Manifest ho.

1625
03:31:41,240 --> 03:31:42,240
Manifest ho.

1626
03:31:43,240 --> 03:31:44,240
Manifest.

1627
03:31:44,240 --> 03:31:45,240
Manifest.

1628
03:31:45,240 --> 03:31:46,240
Manifest.

1629
03:31:47,240 --> 03:31:48,240
Manifest ho.

1630
03:31:49,240 --> 03:31:50,240
Manifest ho.

1631
03:31:56,240 --> 03:31:57,240
Manifest ho.

1632
03:31:58,240 --> 03:31:59,240
Manifest ho.

1633
03:32:00,240 --> 03:32:01,240
Manifest ho.

1634
03:32:02,240 --> 03:32:03,240
Manifest ho.

1635
03:32:03,240 --> 03:32:04,240
We must go outside.

1636
03:32:05,240 --> 03:32:09,240
And then we must protect our brothers and sisters.

1637
03:32:10,240 --> 03:32:12,240
We must stay away from Zergs.

1638
03:32:12,240 --> 03:32:13,240
Yeah.

1639
03:32:20,240 --> 03:32:22,240
It is sign of Clementine.

1640
03:32:24,240 --> 03:32:25,240
Bald.

1641
03:32:25,240 --> 03:32:26,240
Bald Pizarre.

1642
03:32:27,240 --> 03:32:29,240
Doc and Momo.

1643
03:32:30,240 --> 03:32:32,240
It looks like Momo's name was added later.

1644
03:32:38,240 --> 03:32:41,240
We should show them the other notebooks that we found.

1645
03:32:43,240 --> 03:32:44,240
Hey Momo.

1646
03:32:45,240 --> 03:32:46,240
Hey little cat.

1647
03:32:46,240 --> 03:32:49,240
Are you still looking for those useless notebooks?

1648
03:32:50,240 --> 03:32:51,240
I have them.

1649
03:32:51,240 --> 03:32:53,240
Have Clementine's.

1650
03:32:53,240 --> 03:32:55,240
Oh you found Clementine's notes?

1651
03:32:55,240 --> 03:32:57,240
She was really brave you know.

1652
03:32:58,240 --> 03:33:00,240
The most fearless person I ever met.

1653
03:33:01,240 --> 03:33:02,240
Oh.

1654
03:33:04,240 --> 03:33:05,240
Bald Pizarre.

1655
03:33:06,240 --> 03:33:08,240
As Bald Pizarre is notebook right?

1656
03:33:09,240 --> 03:33:10,240
I never quite understood.

1657
03:33:10,240 --> 03:33:12,240
What he was talking about most of the time.

1658
03:33:13,240 --> 03:33:14,240
But he was very wise.

1659
03:33:15,240 --> 03:33:16,240
Oh.

1660
03:33:17,240 --> 03:33:18,240
Docs.

1661
03:33:19,240 --> 03:33:20,240
Wait.

1662
03:33:20,240 --> 03:33:22,240
They actually found all my friends' notebooks.

1663
03:33:24,240 --> 03:33:25,240
Is that?

1664
03:33:25,240 --> 03:33:26,240
Oh.

1665
03:33:26,240 --> 03:33:27,240
What's that note?

1666
03:33:28,240 --> 03:33:30,240
The transceiver can be repaired?

1667
03:33:31,240 --> 03:33:32,240
This is incredible.

1668
03:33:34,240 --> 03:33:37,240
That means we should be able to communicate outside of Sloan.

1669
03:33:37,240 --> 03:33:38,240
Clementine.

1670
03:33:39,240 --> 03:33:40,240
Bald's a hard dog.

1671
03:33:40,240 --> 03:33:42,240
I'm sorry it's out of her cause.

1672
03:33:42,240 --> 03:33:43,240
I'll promise you.

1673
03:33:44,240 --> 03:33:47,240
I will find a way to reach the surface.

1674
03:33:49,240 --> 03:33:50,240
Thank you.

1675
03:33:51,240 --> 03:33:53,240
We might be able to find you a way up.

1676
03:33:53,240 --> 03:33:54,240
Yay.

1677
03:33:55,240 --> 03:33:58,240
Now let's fix this piece of junk transceiver.

1678
03:34:00,240 --> 03:34:03,240
It's fixed around the wall.

1679
03:34:03,240 --> 03:34:05,240
Around the wall.

1680
03:34:06,240 --> 03:34:08,240
Around the wall.

1681
03:34:14,240 --> 03:34:15,240
Et voilà.

1682
03:34:16,240 --> 03:34:17,240
It works.

1683
03:34:22,240 --> 03:34:23,240
Et voilà.

1684
03:34:24,240 --> 03:34:25,240
What do you mean?

1685
03:34:33,240 --> 03:34:35,240
What if I'm not ready to go?

1686
03:34:40,240 --> 03:34:41,240
What's this?

1687
03:34:42,240 --> 03:34:43,240
The city has...

1688
03:34:44,240 --> 03:34:45,240
what?

1689
03:34:46,240 --> 03:34:47,240
Syllinitricle.

1690
03:34:48,240 --> 03:34:49,240
Syllinitricle.

1691
03:34:50,240 --> 03:34:51,240
Syllinitricle.

1692
03:34:52,240 --> 03:34:53,240
Syllinitricle.

1693
03:34:54,240 --> 03:34:55,240
Syllinitricle.

1694
03:34:56,240 --> 03:34:57,240
Syllinitricle.

1695
03:34:58,240 --> 03:34:59,240
Syllinitricle?

1696
03:35:00,240 --> 03:35:01,240
Syllinitricle?

1697
03:35:01,240 --> 03:35:02,240
Syllinitricle?

1698
03:35:02,240 --> 03:35:03,240
Syllinitricle?

1699
03:35:04,240 --> 03:35:05,240
Syllinitricle?

1700
03:35:06,240 --> 03:35:07,240
Syllinitricle.

1701
03:35:09,240 --> 03:35:10,240
Syllinitricle.

1702
03:35:11,240 --> 03:35:13,240
Syllinitricle.

1703
03:35:15,240 --> 03:35:16,240
Syllinitricle.

1704
03:35:16,240 --> 03:35:17,240
Syllinitricle.

1705
03:35:18,240 --> 03:35:19,240
Syllinitricle?

1706
03:35:20,240 --> 03:35:21,240
Syllinitricle.

1707
03:35:22,240 --> 03:35:23,240
Syllinitricle.

1708
03:35:24,240 --> 03:35:25,240
Syllinitricle.

1709
03:35:27,240 --> 03:35:28,240
Syllinitricle.

1710
03:35:28,400 --> 03:35:34,000
We install the trans seever, at the top of that tower, which really communicates with the city.

1711
03:35:34,160 --> 03:35:38,400
My friend might still be outside from the dark.

1712
03:35:38,560 --> 03:35:45,880
We install the samasОd, as we saw in a short video of the Simade v Аte Muужjage.

1713
03:35:46,040 --> 03:35:52,480
Media comments and面 gun.

1714
03:35:52,640 --> 03:35:56,480
I watched the video as well but the recording looks interesting.

1715
03:35:56,480 --> 03:35:58,480
My friends might still be out there.

1716
03:36:00,480 --> 03:36:02,480
Up there is a way out.

1717
03:36:02,480 --> 03:36:03,480
They'll know it.

1718
03:36:05,480 --> 03:36:08,480
Really only one small and quick enough to evade the zirks.

1719
03:36:09,480 --> 03:36:11,480
We need you, little outsider.

1720
03:36:11,480 --> 03:36:13,480
Bring us to the sky.

1721
03:36:18,480 --> 03:36:19,480
This way.

1722
03:36:27,480 --> 03:36:28,480
Where am I?

1723
03:36:29,480 --> 03:36:30,480
Hey.

1724
03:36:36,480 --> 03:36:37,480
Hmm.

1725
03:36:41,480 --> 03:36:42,480
Hmm.

1726
03:36:45,480 --> 03:36:46,480
Hmm.

1727
03:36:49,480 --> 03:36:50,480
Is this safe?

1728
03:36:50,480 --> 03:36:51,480
Hmm, safe.

1729
03:37:08,480 --> 03:37:10,480
Very convenient buckets.

1730
03:37:15,480 --> 03:37:16,480
Rooftops.

1731
03:37:20,480 --> 03:37:21,480
Hmm.

1732
03:37:25,480 --> 03:37:27,480
I don't like this.

1733
03:37:27,480 --> 03:37:28,480
Scary.

1734
03:37:51,480 --> 03:37:52,480
Hmm.

1735
03:37:53,480 --> 03:37:54,480
Hmm.

1736
03:38:15,480 --> 03:38:16,480
Eh.

1737
03:38:21,480 --> 03:38:22,480
Hmm.

1738
03:38:45,480 --> 03:38:46,480
Hmm.

1739
03:38:51,480 --> 03:38:52,480
Hmm.

1740
03:38:55,480 --> 03:38:57,480
Aha, I can get me.

1741
03:39:04,480 --> 03:39:06,480
Oh, where we go?

1742
03:39:06,480 --> 03:39:07,480
From here?

1743
03:39:07,480 --> 03:39:08,480
Up there?

1744
03:39:10,480 --> 03:39:11,480
No, this way.

1745
03:39:18,480 --> 03:39:19,480
Remember?

1746
03:39:21,480 --> 03:39:22,480
Hmm.

1747
03:39:29,480 --> 03:39:31,480
The city is full of neon.

1748
03:39:32,480 --> 03:39:33,480
There's a noise this way.

1749
03:39:35,480 --> 03:39:37,480
There used to be strict energy caps.

1750
03:39:38,480 --> 03:39:40,480
Especially in the salt slums.

1751
03:39:42,480 --> 03:39:44,480
But people couldn't handle the constant darkness.

1752
03:39:46,480 --> 03:39:49,480
One day someone lit up ramble lamps.

1753
03:39:50,480 --> 03:39:53,480
Nian signs all over their house.

1754
03:39:54,480 --> 03:39:57,480
That person was taken away and never seen again.

1755
03:39:58,480 --> 03:40:00,480
But people saw hope.

1756
03:40:00,480 --> 03:40:05,480
And not long after, everyone started putting lots of lights in their homes.

1757
03:40:07,480 --> 03:40:10,480
There was nothing to the oppressors could do.

1758
03:40:11,480 --> 03:40:14,480
It was a way for the people to see color again.

1759
03:40:14,480 --> 03:40:17,480
Like on the outside, I think it helped.

1760
03:40:20,480 --> 03:40:21,480
Hmm.

1761
03:40:45,480 --> 03:40:46,480
Hmm.

1762
03:40:50,480 --> 03:40:51,480
Hmm.

1763
03:40:53,480 --> 03:40:55,480
Do we go that way?

1764
03:41:20,480 --> 03:41:21,480
Hmm.

1765
03:41:21,480 --> 03:41:22,480
Hmm.

1766
03:41:22,480 --> 03:41:23,480
Hmm.

1767
03:41:23,480 --> 03:41:24,480
Hmm.

1768
03:41:24,480 --> 03:41:25,480
Hmm.

1769
03:41:25,480 --> 03:41:26,480
Hmm.

1770
03:41:26,480 --> 03:41:27,480
Hmm.

1771
03:41:27,480 --> 03:41:28,480
Hmm.

1772
03:41:28,480 --> 03:41:29,480
Hmm.

1773
03:41:29,480 --> 03:41:30,480
Hmm.

1774
03:41:30,480 --> 03:41:31,480
Hmm.

1775
03:41:31,480 --> 03:41:32,480
Hmm.

1776
03:41:32,480 --> 03:41:33,480
Hmm.

1777
03:41:33,480 --> 03:41:34,480
Hmm.

1778
03:41:34,480 --> 03:41:35,480
Hmm.

1779
03:41:35,480 --> 03:41:36,480
Hmm.

1780
03:41:36,480 --> 03:41:37,480
Hmm.

1781
03:41:39,480 --> 03:41:40,480
Hmm.

1782
03:41:40,480 --> 03:41:41,480
Hmm.

1783
03:41:41,480 --> 03:41:42,480
Hmm.

1784
03:41:42,480 --> 03:41:43,480
Hmm.

1785
03:41:43,480 --> 03:41:44,480
Hmm.

1786
03:41:44,480 --> 03:41:45,480
Hmm.

1787
03:41:45,480 --> 03:41:46,480
Hmm.

1788
03:41:46,480 --> 03:41:47,480
Hmm.

1789
03:41:47,480 --> 03:41:48,480
Hmm.

1790
03:41:48,480 --> 03:41:49,480
Hmm.

1791
03:41:49,480 --> 03:41:50,480
Hmm.

1792
03:41:50,480 --> 03:41:51,480
Hmm.

1793
03:41:51,480 --> 03:41:52,480
Hmm.

1794
03:41:52,480 --> 03:41:53,480
Hmm.

1795
03:41:53,480 --> 03:41:54,480
Hmm.

1796
03:41:54,480 --> 03:41:55,480
Hmm.

1797
03:41:55,480 --> 03:41:56,480
Hmm.

1798
03:41:56,480 --> 03:41:57,480
Hmm.

1799
03:41:57,480 --> 03:41:58,480
Hmm.

1800
03:41:58,480 --> 03:41:59,480
Hmm.

1801
03:41:59,480 --> 03:42:00,480
Hmm.

1802
03:42:00,480 --> 03:42:01,480
Hmm.

1803
03:42:02,480 --> 03:42:03,480
Hmm.

1804
03:42:03,480 --> 03:42:04,480
Hmm.

1805
03:42:04,480 --> 03:42:05,480
Hmm.

1806
03:42:05,480 --> 03:42:06,480
Hmm.

1807
03:42:07,480 --> 03:42:08,480
Hmm.

1808
03:42:08,480 --> 03:42:09,480
Hmm.

1809
03:42:09,480 --> 03:42:10,480
Hmm.

1810
03:42:10,480 --> 03:42:11,480
Hmm.

03:43:12,480 --> 03:43:16,460
Let's go from here.

1822
03:43:42,480 --> 03:43:44,480
Am I missing anything?

1823
03:43:44,480 --> 03:43:46,480
Am I missing anything?

1824
03:44:10,960 --> 03:44:12,960
Oh, what the?

1825
03:44:15,280 --> 03:44:17,280
Oh

1826
03:44:22,720 --> 03:44:24,720
Oh boy

1827
03:44:32,720 --> 03:44:34,720
This is so gross

1828
03:44:45,440 --> 03:44:56,320
It's all sticky. Yeah, it's super sticky and it makes really gross wet noises. It's like

1829
03:44:59,760 --> 03:45:01,760
It's really gross

1830
03:45:03,680 --> 03:45:05,680
It's sticky wet noises

1831
03:45:07,440 --> 03:45:09,440
Um

1832
03:45:14,480 --> 03:45:16,480
Oh

1833
03:45:31,840 --> 03:45:33,840
Go go go go go

1834
03:45:40,080 --> 03:45:42,080
No no no go go go go go go

1835
03:45:44,480 --> 03:45:46,800
Oh

1836
03:46:14,480 --> 03:46:16,480
Oh

1837
03:46:23,200 --> 03:46:25,920
How do you turn this off? I turned it on by accident

1838
03:46:28,720 --> 03:46:33,760
How do you turn off the light? How do you turn off the light? I turned it on by accident

1839
03:46:44,640 --> 03:46:46,640
Oh

1840
03:46:57,440 --> 03:47:04,000
Niko ni niko korp they're responsible for waste management

1841
03:47:04,000 --> 03:47:14,720
As trash from the upper levels overloaded the slums to try to develop bacteria to dissolve at all

1842
03:47:16,560 --> 03:47:23,360
After the humans disappeared that bacteria mutated growing eating way more than trash

1843
03:47:24,800 --> 03:47:29,120
And now we have zirks. Oh, no, let's go

1844
03:47:29,440 --> 03:47:31,440
Oh

1845
03:47:32,960 --> 03:47:34,960
It's all sticky

1846
03:47:59,360 --> 03:48:01,360
Oh

1847
03:48:13,600 --> 03:48:15,600
Ah

1848
03:48:29,120 --> 03:48:31,120
Oh

1849
03:48:41,520 --> 03:48:43,520
Wait don't I need this open?

1850
03:48:46,560 --> 03:48:48,560
Wait don't I need this open?

1851
03:48:54,400 --> 03:48:56,400
Like this

1852
03:48:59,120 --> 03:49:01,120
Oh

1853
03:49:18,560 --> 03:49:20,560
Oh

1854
03:49:22,080 --> 03:49:24,080
Oh, thank you

1855
03:49:29,120 --> 03:49:31,120
Oh

1856
03:50:00,000 --> 03:50:02,000
Da

1857
03:50:24,640 --> 03:50:26,640
This is treachery

1858
03:50:27,600 --> 03:50:29,600
This is treachery

1859
03:50:47,280 --> 03:50:49,280
I have no clue what's happening

1860
03:50:50,240 --> 03:50:53,280
I don't know I thought it was a force restart

1861
03:50:53,840 --> 03:50:57,760
But I don't a force update, but I checked to see

1862
03:50:59,120 --> 03:51:04,000
I went to go check to see if my computer even has like even is on

1863
03:51:04,400 --> 03:51:11,440
To update for anything during this time and it's not it's not it's not set to update during this time

1864
03:51:11,760 --> 03:51:14,080
So it wasn't a force restart. I have no clue

1865
03:51:14,400 --> 03:51:17,120
My computer keeps turning off on me

1866
03:51:18,720 --> 03:51:23,120
It keeps turning off or restarting on its own and I have no clue why

1867
03:51:27,280 --> 03:51:34,800
I have no clue why I'm such bad luck. It's so bad. I don't know what's happening

1868
03:51:44,080 --> 03:51:46,080
Oh

1869
03:52:01,280 --> 03:52:03,760
It's not my internet my internet is fine like

1870
03:52:05,760 --> 03:52:09,520
Fairly getting fixed my internet is perfectly fine at the moment

1871
03:52:10,560 --> 03:52:12,560
So it's not my internet

1872
03:52:12,880 --> 03:52:19,440
Because if it was my internet then that would have turned off then that would have turned off and so would have this would have turned off

1873
03:52:19,520 --> 03:52:22,000
And so would have my fan and so my

1874
03:52:22,480 --> 03:52:26,480
Little broken half broken mini fridge would have also turned off

1875
03:52:27,040 --> 03:52:29,040
But no

1876
03:52:29,280 --> 03:52:32,160
So it's not my power. It's not my internet

1877
03:52:32,800 --> 03:52:37,120
Because the little bar thingy didn't pop up if it was the internet it wouldn't turn off my

1878
03:52:38,320 --> 03:52:40,320
Computer if it was the internet

1879
03:52:41,280 --> 03:52:47,600
Instead it would just disconnect me and then reconnect me disconnect me reconnect me, but if it was power

1880
03:52:48,640 --> 03:52:52,240
If it was power half of this side of my room would turn off

1881
03:52:53,920 --> 03:52:55,920
If it was power

1882
03:52:56,960 --> 03:53:01,360
But everything else is still on and running just fine. So I don't know what it is

1883
03:53:03,920 --> 03:53:05,920
We'll figure it out

1884
03:53:06,880 --> 03:53:08,880
later

1885
03:53:09,760 --> 03:53:11,760
We'll figure it out

1886
03:53:13,760 --> 03:53:15,760
Uh

1887
03:53:17,280 --> 03:53:19,280
For now I can like uh

1888
03:53:24,400 --> 03:53:29,040
I don't know turn this down. It's not any of this like I checked

1889
03:53:30,960 --> 03:53:35,280
My cpu everything is running everything is running smoothly

1890
03:53:35,840 --> 03:53:41,280
Very smoothly. Look at that everything rings running completely smoothly

1891
03:53:45,760 --> 03:53:47,760
Yeah, this is fine

1892
03:53:48,560 --> 03:53:50,400
This is fine

1893
03:53:50,400 --> 03:53:53,040
So is this so is this this is okay

1894
03:53:54,320 --> 03:53:56,320
Everything's fine

1895
03:53:58,000 --> 03:54:00,000
Yeah later

1896
03:54:05,920 --> 03:54:16,240
I'm gonna keep this on in the background so I can look at it just to see how it is. I'm playing

1897
03:54:24,960 --> 03:54:26,800
Like the purring and he's gonna come back in

1898
03:54:28,880 --> 03:54:30,880
At least it stopped right where we left off

1899
03:54:31,520 --> 03:54:33,520
And

1900
03:54:48,320 --> 03:54:52,800
This is a PC on its last legs impossible. It's a completely brand new rig

1901
03:54:53,280 --> 03:54:59,760
There's no way that it could be on its last legs my old computer. Yeah, that was on its last legs

1902
03:54:59,840 --> 03:55:01,840
But this is completely new

1903
03:55:01,920 --> 03:55:03,920
There's no way

1904
03:55:04,240 --> 03:55:07,200
I just have horrible luck when it comes to technology

1905
03:55:08,480 --> 03:55:10,480
That I know

1906
03:55:10,640 --> 03:55:12,640
That I know my head is big hang on

1907
03:55:15,520 --> 03:55:17,520
That I know

1908
03:55:17,920 --> 03:55:19,920
Oh

1909
03:55:33,280 --> 03:55:36,080
Oh, we have to do all of this again. Oh man

1910
03:55:48,080 --> 03:55:57,520
We need stronti and tekken. Right now main sound will help me with whatever needs to be done

1911
03:56:00,240 --> 03:56:02,240
It will help

1912
03:56:03,040 --> 03:56:10,240
They were responsible for waste management. Oh, yeah, we already read all of this

1913
03:56:12,000 --> 03:56:17,360
Main sound has been helping me with everything else. So

1914
03:56:17,520 --> 03:56:20,880
Bar we still can't figure it out meds. Oh, yeah, I haven't taken that

1915
03:56:21,440 --> 03:56:24,080
Let me take that right now. There's heart medication

1916
03:56:47,520 --> 03:56:50,240

Come on, let's go back and find Momo. Not that we have connected the transmitter.

2052
04:08:52,740 --> 04:08:56,740
We should be able to get help.

04:09:33,740 --> 04:09:40,740
Is our car have a name? Our car doesn't have a name.

2056
04:09:40,740 --> 04:09:45,740
Want to name the car?

2057

2059
04:10:32,740 --> 04:10:36,740
My cat had a similar toy by the way to this. I still have it.

2060
04:10:36,740 --> 04:10:40,740
It's like a little ball.

2061
04:10:55,740 --> 04:11:01,740
It was his favorite. He used to pick it up and walk around with it.

2062
04:11:02,740 --> 04:11:06,740
He would like zoom across the floor with it.

2063
04:11:14,740 --> 04:11:18,740
I can't. Where is it? Speech bubble.

2064
04:11:18,740 --> 04:11:22,740
Look, a note.

2065
04:11:22,740 --> 04:11:27,740
A little outside of your reading this. That means you're still alive. Excellent.

2066
04:11:27,740 --> 04:11:32,740
I took some equipment to the bar to take advantage of the antenna.

2067
04:11:32,740 --> 04:11:35,740
Come meet me there.

2068
04:11:35,740 --> 04:11:40,740
I've locked the window but the code to open it is quite simple.

2069
04:11:40,740 --> 04:11:43,740
It is.

2070
04:11:43,740 --> 04:11:46,740
That's supposed to be simple? The fuck?

2071
04:11:46,740 --> 04:11:50,740
It's not fucking simple.

2072
04:11:50,740 --> 04:11:55,740
Be careful. It is case sensitive. See, you have the bar.

2073
04:11:55,740 --> 04:11:59,740
Whoa, whoa.

2074
04:11:59,740 --> 04:12:04,740
That must be the code for the window near the entrance. Let's go.

2075
04:12:04,740 --> 04:12:09,740
Chad, remember that? Remember that? Remember the code for me?

2076
04:12:14,740 --> 04:12:19,740
Chad, remember that? Remember that? Remember that please?

2077
04:12:19,740 --> 04:12:23,740
Remember that?

2078
04:12:25,740 --> 04:12:29,740
The code was...

2079
04:12:29,740 --> 04:12:33,740
What was the code? What was the code?

2080
04:12:33,740 --> 04:12:37,740
What was the code?

2081
04:12:37,740 --> 04:12:41,740
It's my back.

2082
04:12:41,740 --> 04:12:45,740
Let's try it again.

2083
04:12:45,740 --> 04:12:49,740
Let's see. Success.

2084
04:12:49,740 --> 04:12:53,740
You guys did it! Yay!

2085
04:12:53,740 --> 04:12:58,740

2086

Oh yeah, the thing that came back.

2087
04:13:22,740 --> 04:13:27,740

04:22:43,560 --> 04:22:47,560
I will get you to move one way or another.

04:22:51,560 --> 04:22:53,560
You want something?

2211
04:22:54,560 --> 04:22:56,560
No, aren't you sitting earlier?

04:23:09,560 --> 04:23:10,560
Oh.

2213
04:23:13,560 --> 04:23:14,560
No.

2214
04:23:27,560 --> 04:23:30,560
Let me see if I can get this thing working.

2215
04:23:38,560 --> 04:23:40,560
I almost got it.

2216
04:23:43,560 --> 04:23:47,560
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

2217
04:23:48,560 --> 04:23:50,560
Hello? Yes, we can hear you.

2218
04:23:50,560 --> 04:23:53,560
We're from the slums. We're looking for a way out and...

2219
04:23:53,560 --> 04:23:55,560
What is that? You?

2220
04:23:56,560 --> 04:23:57,560
Balzahar?

2221
04:23:58,560 --> 04:23:59,560
Mama?

2222
04:24:02,560 --> 04:24:06,560
I can't believe it. I'm so happy to hear your voice, Balzahar.

2223
04:24:07,560 --> 04:24:08,560
Where are you?

2224
04:24:08,560 --> 04:24:10,560
Are the others okay?

2225
04:24:11,560 --> 04:24:14,560
Yes, we are safe. We found a way out.

2226
04:24:17,560 --> 04:24:18,560
Hello?

2227
04:24:18,560 --> 04:24:20,560
Can you still hear me?

2228
04:24:20,560 --> 04:24:23,560
You have to go through the sewers to reach us.

2229
04:24:24,560 --> 04:24:27,560
Very dangerous. It lurks everywhere.

2230
04:24:30,560 --> 04:24:32,560
Sewers? How? Hello?

2231
04:24:33,560 --> 04:24:35,560
Darn it. We've lost the signal.

2232
04:24:36,560 --> 04:24:39,560
I can't believe it. Balzahar is alive.

2233
04:24:40,560 --> 04:24:44,560
He on the other outside has managed to go up through the sewers.

2234
04:24:45,560 --> 04:24:48,560
The sewers are the most dangerous place in the slums.

2235
04:24:48,560 --> 04:24:51,560
But if Balzahar made it, there must be a way.

2236
04:25:03,560 --> 04:25:04,560
Seamus.

2237
04:25:05,560 --> 04:25:08,560
Of course, it has to be someone named Seamus.

2238
04:25:11,560 --> 04:25:12,560
I...

2239
04:25:14,560 --> 04:25:17,560
You'll never get past the sewers.

2240
04:25:17,560 --> 04:25:19,560
It's infested with serics.

2241
04:25:19,560 --> 04:25:21,560
They'll make a quick meal out of you.

2242
04:25:21,560 --> 04:25:23,560
Especially you, little one.

2243
04:25:24,560 --> 04:25:26,560
Many try their luck in the past.

2244
04:25:26,560 --> 04:25:28,560
It doesn't end well.

2245
04:25:29,560 --> 04:25:32,560
Anyway, I warned you.

2246
04:25:33,560 --> 04:25:35,560
Your business is none of my business.

2247
04:25:41,560 --> 04:25:43,560
Seamus.

2248
04:25:44,560 --> 04:25:48,560
His father, Doc, used to be a great scientist.

2249
04:25:49,560 --> 04:25:52,560
He was working on some new weapon to fight the zirks.

2250
04:25:53,560 --> 04:25:58,560
So, years ago, he went off to test the device and never came back.

2251
04:25:59,560 --> 04:26:02,560
Seamus has never been the same since.

2252
04:26:02,560 --> 04:26:05,560
Don't listen to Seamus. He's just scared like I was.

2253
04:26:05,560 --> 04:26:10,560
If Doc build a weapon, that's our ticket to join the outsiders.

2254
04:26:11,560 --> 04:26:15,560
And as notebook Doc mentioned, the secret lab a few times.

2255
04:26:15,560 --> 04:26:17,560
That must be where he was working on it.

2256
04:26:19,560 --> 04:26:21,560
There might be a clue.

2257
04:26:22,560 --> 04:26:24,560
But I don't know.

2258
04:26:25,560 --> 04:26:27,560
I don't know.

2259
04:26:27,560 --> 04:26:29,560
I don't know where he was working on it.

2260
04:26:30,560 --> 04:26:34,560
There might be a clue in Seamus' apartment.

2261
04:26:34,560 --> 04:26:36,560
Go on, follow me.

2262
04:26:45,560 --> 04:26:48,560
I follow Mr. Robot.

2263
04:26:57,560 --> 04:27:00,560
I don't know where he was working on it.

2264
04:27:00,560 --> 04:27:03,560
I don't know where he was working on it.

2265
04:27:24,560 --> 04:27:26,560
Can you move it away?

2266
04:27:26,560 --> 04:27:28,560
Grandma made a scarf. Isn't it wonderful?

2267
04:27:29,560 --> 04:27:31,560
She knits so well.

2268
04:27:57,560 --> 04:28:00,560
I don't know where he was working on it.

2269
04:28:00,560 --> 04:28:02,560
I don't know where he was working on it.

2270
04:28:02,560 --> 04:28:04,560

Two, then what's that code for?

2321
04:32:10,580 --> 04:32:12,580
Two...

2322
04:32:12,580 --> 04:32:14,580
Five, one...

2323
04:32:17,580 --> 04:32:19,580
Two, five, one, one.

2324
04:32:20,580 --> 04:32:23,580
What's the code that you guys have?

2325
04:32:23,580 --> 04:32:25,580
What's that code for?

2326
04:32:28,580 --> 04:32:29,580
Meow.

2327
04:32:39,580 --> 04:32:41,580
Whoa.

2328
04:32:41,580 --> 04:32:43,580
I've never seen this room.

2329
04:32:43,580 --> 04:32:46,580
I can't believe you managed to hide it from me all this time.

2330
04:32:47,580 --> 04:32:49,580
How was it for the safe?

2331
04:32:49,580 --> 04:32:51,580
Oh, right. I forgot.

2332
04:32:51,580 --> 04:32:53,580
Yeah.

2333
04:32:53,580 --> 04:32:55,580
These blueprints...

2334
04:32:55,580 --> 04:33:00,580
They must be for his zerk weapon.

2335
04:33:00,580 --> 04:33:05,580
Papa was always so secretive with his work.

2336
04:33:05,580 --> 04:33:08,580
He told me the weapon was working.

2337
04:33:08,580 --> 04:33:12,580
In theory, but it needed a real life test.

2338
04:33:12,580 --> 04:33:16,580
He went outside the slums, and he never came back.

2339
04:33:29,580 --> 04:33:34,580
Robots, new headlines, zerk, are officially no longer under control.

2340
04:33:35,580 --> 04:33:37,580
They now eat metal.

2341
04:33:54,580 --> 04:33:57,580
The flux are blueprints.

2342
04:33:57,580 --> 04:34:03,580
Concept, light-based, handgun, low-priority, visual-appearance-size,

2343
04:34:03,580 --> 04:34:09,580
sceptile, emitted, high-priority, test in real condition,

2344
04:34:09,580 --> 04:34:14,580
objective, 20 zerk destroyed per second.

2345
04:34:28,580 --> 04:34:30,580
Let me down.

2346
04:34:30,580 --> 04:34:32,580
Is there anything in here?

2347
04:34:32,580 --> 04:34:34,580
Nothing, I don't know.

2348
04:34:38,580 --> 04:34:43,580
I'm stuck. Get it off me! Get it off me!

2349
04:34:43,580 --> 04:34:45,580
Okay, there you go.

2350
04:34:48,580 --> 04:34:52,580
Anything up here? No?

2351
04:34:57,580 --> 04:35:06,580
Observation.

2352
04:35:06,580 --> 04:35:12,580
They now eat metal, then why haven't they eaten everything?

2353
04:35:12,580 --> 04:35:16,580
Maybe because they take time? I don't know.

2354
04:35:16,580 --> 04:35:19,580
Maybe it takes time. Maybe this is...

2355
04:35:19,580 --> 04:35:22,580
They just developed into doing this.

2356
04:35:23,580 --> 04:35:29,580
Maybe they become intelligent.

2357
04:35:29,580 --> 04:35:35,580
Maybe there is smarter bacteria now.

2358
04:35:35,580 --> 04:35:38,580
I need dwelling.

2359
04:35:38,580 --> 04:35:42,580
They are just not that hungry.

2360
04:35:42,580 --> 04:35:45,580
Cute sounds, but never friendly.

2361
04:35:45,580 --> 04:35:47,580
Old bacteria of human time.

2362
04:35:47,580 --> 04:35:50,580
Eat all kinds of materials.

2363
04:35:50,580 --> 04:35:53,580
Total vision in the dark.

2364
04:35:53,580 --> 04:35:55,580
React to intense light.

2365
04:35:55,580 --> 04:35:57,580
I'll see, there you go.

2366
04:35:57,580 --> 04:36:01,580
Maybe because light stops them.

2367
04:36:01,580 --> 04:36:03,580
Maybe it's light.

2368
04:36:03,580 --> 04:36:06,580
Light stops them.

2369
04:36:06,580 --> 04:36:09,580
Am I missing something?

2370
04:36:09,580 --> 04:36:11,580
Oh, a box.

2371
04:36:21,580 --> 04:36:24,580
Find anything interesting in here?

2372
04:36:24,580 --> 04:36:27,580
Yeah, this broken tracker.

2373
04:36:30,580 --> 04:36:32,580
Wait, I remember that.

2374
04:36:32,580 --> 04:36:34,580
That's his tracker.

2375
04:36:34,580 --> 04:36:38,580
Papa always used that tracker to keep an eye on where I was.

2376
04:36:38,580 --> 04:36:42,580
Maybe he can reverse it to find where he went.

2377
04:36:42,580 --> 04:36:45,580
I can't believe my papa might still be alive.

2378
04:36:45,580 --> 04:36:47,580
I missed him so much.

2379
04:36:48,580 --> 04:36:51,580
You need a weapon for this herbs, right?

2380
04:36:51,580 --> 04:36:53,580
My papa definitely took one with him.

2381
04:36:56,580 --> 04:36:59,580
We just need to repair the tracker so we can find him.

2382
04:36:59,580 --> 04:37:02,580
Someone in the slum should be able to help.

2383
04:37:02,580 --> 04:37:05,580
Come with me. I'll open the door for you.

2384
04:37:05,580 --> 04:37:07,580
Whoa.

2385
04:37:07,580 --> 04:37:09,580
Where are we going?

2386
04:37:09,580 --> 04:37:11,580
Where are we going?

2387
04:37:17,580 --> 04:37:19,580
Meow.

2388
04:37:19,580 --> 04:37:21,580
Meow.

2389
04:37:24,580 --> 04:37:26,580
Meow.

2390
04:37:32,580 --> 04:37:34,580
You gotta fix that tracker.

2391
04:37:34,580 --> 04:37:36,580
You're resourceful.

2392
04:37:36,580 --> 04:37:38,580
Maybe you can find someone in the slum to help.

2393
04:37:38,580 --> 04:37:41,580
Alright, see you later, shameless.

2394
04:37:47,580 --> 04:37:49,580
I'll see you later.

2395
04:38:02,580 --> 04:38:05,580
You aren't always standing here. Who are you?

2396
04:38:05,580 --> 04:38:08,580
Look at all this great stuff that falls at our tracks.

2397
04:38:08,580 --> 04:38:10,580
So many treasures.

2398
04:38:10,580 --> 04:38:14,580
You should go visit Bart, Barterman.

2399
04:38:14,580 --> 04:38:17,580
There's something for everyone over there.

2400
04:38:18,580 --> 04:38:20,580
Bart, Barterman.

2401
04:38:20,580 --> 04:38:22,580
Barterman, yeah.

2402
04:38:22,580 --> 04:38:24,580
Barterman.

2403
04:38:27,580 --> 04:38:29,580
He's not Barterman.

2404
04:38:29,580 --> 04:38:31,580
He's Azuz.

2405
04:38:31,580 --> 04:38:33,580
Azuz.

2406
04:38:33,580 --> 04:38:35,580
Azuz.

2407
04:38:35,580 --> 04:38:37,580
Lito.

2408
04:38:37,580 --> 04:38:39,580
Are you Barterman?

2409
04:38:39,580 --> 04:38:41,580
Vinz?

2410
04:38:41,580 --> 04:38:43,580
Where's Barterman?

2411
04:38:44,580 --> 04:38:46,580
Bart, Barterman.

2412
04:38:49,580 --> 04:38:51,580
Rosie?

2413
04:38:55,580 --> 04:38:57,580
More keys?

2414
04:38:57,580 --> 04:39:00,580
Oh, yeah. The code for this was the code for this.

2415
04:39:00,580 --> 04:39:02,580
Oh, goodnight.

2416
04:39:02,580 --> 04:39:06,580
Goodnight. Thank you for sleeping by today's stream.

2417
04:39:06,580 --> 04:39:09,580
Sorry for all the crashes.

2418
04:39:09,580 --> 04:39:11,580
Where are the crashes.

2419
04:39:11,580 --> 04:39:13,580

Wouldn't you like me to tell you what we do?

2440
04:41:20,220 --> 04:41:21,420

We make good music for awesome people.

We've been making good money lately.

2445
04:41:30,920 --> 04:41:32,600
And we've written a lot of music songs.

Their name isn't Bradman.

2481
04:44:59,540 --> 04:45:02,540
Yeah, their name's not Bradman.

04:46:19,540 --> 04:46:21,540
Teddy.

2498
04:46:21,540 --> 04:46:25,540
Teddy Ursa!

2499
04:46:25,540 --> 04:46:27,540
Carl.

2500
04:46:27,540 --> 04:46:30,540
Azna.

2501
04:46:30,540 --> 04:46:33,540
What?

2502
04:46:33,540 --> 04:46:38,540
Who the heck is Bradman?

2503
04:46:38,540 --> 04:46:41,540
Rosie.

2504
04:46:49,540 --> 04:46:53,540
Is this face someone's coming off?

2505
04:46:57,540 --> 04:47:02,540
Feels like a wild wire is coming out of his face.

2506
04:47:02,540 --> 04:47:05,540
Hehehe.

2507
04:47:05,540 --> 04:47:09,540
No, no, that's not Bradman.

2508
04:47:13,540 --> 04:47:16,540
Am I just dumb?

2509
04:47:16,540 --> 04:47:20,540
What the heck is Bradman?

2510
04:47:20,540 --> 04:47:23,540
Bartering is to trade.

2511
04:47:23,540 --> 04:47:27,540
It's Azuz?

2512
04:47:27,540 --> 04:47:30,540
Barterman.

2513
04:47:30,540 --> 04:47:35,540
Oh, oh, oh.

2514
04:47:35,540 --> 04:47:37,540
Do I still talk to them?

2515
04:47:37,540 --> 04:47:42,540
Do I talk to them? Do I show them stuff?

2516
04:47:42,540 --> 04:47:46,540
No, I don't, I don't talk to them.

2517
04:47:46,540 --> 04:47:49,540
See?

2518
04:47:49,540 --> 04:47:52,540
Do they want something from me?

2519
04:47:52,540 --> 04:47:55,540
And I don't?

2520
04:47:56,540 --> 04:48:00,540
Barter, Barter.

2521
04:48:00,540 --> 04:48:03,540
I'm down.

2522
04:48:03,540 --> 04:48:07,540
I'm stuck.

2523
04:48:22,540 --> 04:48:24,540
I'm so lost.

2524
04:48:24,540 --> 04:48:27,540
Uh...

2525
04:48:30,540 --> 04:48:34,540
Does any of these give me a hint?

2526
04:48:34,540 --> 04:48:39,540
This tracker is meant to find some sort of robot.

2527
04:48:39,540 --> 04:48:43,540
Of course it's broken, we should find a way to repair it.

2528
04:48:43,540 --> 04:48:49,540
Oh! I know! I know! I know! I know! Go fix it! I know!

2529
04:48:49,540 --> 04:48:51,540
This person.

2530
04:48:51,540 --> 04:48:54,540
This person.

2531
04:48:54,540 --> 04:48:57,540
This person.

2532
04:49:00,540 --> 04:49:02,540
You!

2533
04:49:02,540 --> 04:49:06,540
Elliot! Hi, Elliot!

2534
04:49:06,540 --> 04:49:09,540
Thanks for the poncho.

2535
04:49:09,540 --> 04:49:11,540
Please come see if you ever need something fixed.

2536
04:49:11,540 --> 04:49:14,540
Yeah, I need something fixed. Destiny.

2537
04:49:14,540 --> 04:49:18,540
Oh wow, that's a great tracker. I recognize this model.

2538
04:49:18,540 --> 04:49:25,540
It's Touhima BR2000.

2539
04:49:25,540 --> 04:49:31,540
You can track anyone with this little gadget, may I?

2540
04:49:31,540 --> 04:49:38,540
Let me take a look. Just gotta give it an update and one more thing. Voila!

2541
04:49:42,540 --> 04:49:47,540
There you go, little one. Go look, find out who you're looking for.

2542
04:49:47,540 --> 04:49:51,540
Thanks, Elliot!

2543
04:49:51,540 --> 04:49:54,540
Elliot's so nice.

2544
04:50:07,540 --> 04:50:10,540
Really nice. That's a great trait these days.

2545
04:50:10,540 --> 04:50:15,540
If you ever want to hang out, you're always welcome. See you around.

2546
04:50:15,540 --> 04:50:18,540
I know, sir. Let me out.

2547
04:50:22,540 --> 04:50:24,540
Gee.

2548
04:50:29,540 --> 04:50:31,540
Meow.

2549
04:50:39,540 --> 04:50:42,540
Oh, hehehe.

2550
04:50:46,540 --> 04:50:49,540
Gee.

2551
04:50:57,540 --> 04:51:01,540
Alright, energy rich yet? I'm poor.

2552
04:51:01,540 --> 04:51:07,540
Hehehe. I'm poor. Now I bring this back to Samus.

2553
04:51:15,540 --> 04:51:17,540
Samus.

2554
04:51:17,540 --> 04:51:19,540
Samus.

2555
04:51:21,540 --> 04:51:23,540
Samus.

2556
04:51:23,540 --> 04:51:25,540
Samus.

2557
04:51:26,540 --> 04:51:28,540
Meow.

2558
04:51:28,540 --> 04:51:32,540
You managed to fix that tracker? Yeah. Yeah.

2559
04:51:32,540 --> 04:51:35,540
You didn't. You fixed it a little done.

2560
04:51:35,540 --> 04:51:37,540
Give me here.

2561
04:51:38,540 --> 04:51:41,540
She's woke up.

2562
04:51:41,540 --> 04:51:43,540
Good morning.

2563
04:51:43,540 --> 04:51:46,540
Yeah, good morning.

2564
04:51:46,540 --> 04:51:49,540
Out of your sleep, girl.

2565
04:51:49,540 --> 04:51:52,540
You have nice dreams.

2566
04:51:58,540 --> 04:52:00,540
We got a ping.

2567
04:52:00,540 --> 04:52:04,540
Is Papa really alive? I can't believe it.

2568
04:52:04,540 --> 04:52:08,540
Let's follow the tracker. Maybe we'll find where my papa went.

2569

Pum-pum-pum-pum-pum-pum-pum.

2570

Meow.

2572
04:52:31,540 --> 04:52:34,540
Pum-pum-pum-pum-pum-pum-pum.

2573
04:52:43,540 --> 04:52:45,540
Papa.

2574
04:52:45,540 --> 04:52:47,540

Hang on. Is everybody live right now?

2603
04:55:51,760 --> 04:55:53,760
Is everybody live right now?

2604
04:55:56,760 --> 04:55:58,760
There's no idea. Is he still streaming?

2605
04:55:58,760 --> 04:55:59,760
I guess.

2606
04:56:07,760 --> 04:56:09,760
Is everybody live right now?

2607
04:56:19,760 --> 04:56:21,760
Let's chill out for a little bit.

2608
04:56:23,760 --> 04:56:25,760
We'll go read the mercy.

2609
04:56:31,760 --> 04:56:35,760
Is there any sign of all the crashes that was happening throughout the rest of the game?

2610
04:56:35,760 --> 04:56:37,760
Big mommy.

2611
04:56:37,760 --> 04:56:39,760
That's me.

2612
04:56:42,760 --> 04:56:45,760
We're excited that the crashes kept happening.

2613
04:56:46,760 --> 04:56:49,760
It's so weird. I don't know why it was happening.

2614
04:56:49,760 --> 04:56:51,760
We'll both figure it out.

2615
04:56:51,760 --> 04:56:54,760
We'll come and figure out why it's happening.

2616
04:56:54,760 --> 04:56:56,760
I'm going to be...

2617
04:56:59,760 --> 04:57:01,760
Let me see.

2618
04:57:05,760 --> 04:57:07,760
Let me see.

2619
04:57:11,760 --> 04:57:13,760
Let me hear.

2620
04:57:13,760 --> 04:57:15,760
Let me follow you.

2621
04:57:16,760 --> 04:57:18,760
Let me go.

2622
04:57:18,760 --> 04:57:20,760
Let me go.

2623
04:57:20,760 --> 04:57:22,760
Let me go.

2624
04:57:23,760 --> 04:57:25,760
Let me go.

2625
04:57:36,760 --> 04:57:38,760
Let me go.

2626
04:57:45,760 --> 04:57:48,760
I keep thinking the straw and the lantern.

2627
04:57:48,760 --> 04:57:51,760
I hit trust.

2628
04:57:51,760 --> 04:57:53,760
I'm french fries.

2629
04:57:57,760 --> 04:58:00,760
With all of it combined, it does look like french fries.

2630
04:58:01,760 --> 04:58:03,760
You make me hungry.

2631
04:58:05,760 --> 04:58:07,760
I want french fries.

2632
04:58:12,760 --> 04:58:14,760
Are you sure you're just hungry?

2633
04:58:14,760 --> 04:58:16,760
Definitely hungry.

2634
04:58:16,760 --> 04:58:19,760
They're definitely hungry like me.

2635
04:58:21,760 --> 04:58:23,760
Good night.

2636
04:58:24,760 --> 04:58:26,760
We're all leaving right now.

2637
04:58:26,760 --> 04:58:28,760
Sweet dreams.

2638
04:58:28,760 --> 04:58:30,760
Hang on a second.

2639
04:58:31,760 --> 04:58:33,760
I'm not going anywhere just yet.

2640
04:58:33,760 --> 04:58:35,760
Hang on a bit.

2641
04:58:45,760 --> 04:58:47,760
You're such a rush.

2642
04:58:48,760 --> 04:58:50,760
Eight.

2643
04:59:01,760 --> 04:59:03,760
Yeah, I'm still going to go for a moment.

2644
04:59:03,760 --> 04:59:06,760
We're always going to chat for a little bit before I end.

2645
04:59:06,760 --> 04:59:09,760
Usually, unless I'm in a rush to go.

2646
04:59:10,760 --> 04:59:12,760
To go somewhere.

2647
04:59:12,760 --> 04:59:14,760
But I'm not always in a rush.

2648
04:59:14,760 --> 04:59:16,760
Let me try to do it a little bit.

2649
04:59:21,760 --> 04:59:23,760
Excuse me.

2650
04:59:23,760 --> 04:59:25,760
Are you liking the game?

2651
04:59:25,760 --> 04:59:26,760
Yeah, I love string.

2652
04:59:26,760 --> 04:59:28,760
It's a really good game. It's super cute.

2653
04:59:28,760 --> 04:59:30,760
I love the graphics. It's super nice.

2654
04:59:30,760 --> 04:59:32,760
The story is interesting.

2655
04:59:32,760 --> 04:59:34,760
So sad for the humans.

2656
04:59:36,760 --> 04:59:38,760
Super, super sad.

2657
04:59:38,760 --> 04:59:40,760
Super sad.

2658
04:59:42,760 --> 04:59:44,760
No, no, no, no, no.

2659
05:00:08,760 --> 05:00:10,760
Wait, wait, wait.

2660
05:00:24,760 --> 05:00:26,760
Excuse me.

2661
05:00:26,760 --> 05:00:28,760
Bye.

2662
05:00:29,760 --> 05:00:32,760

2771
05:11:49,820 --> 05:11:57,500
it was that or tea i would have make tea honey lemon tea i had the honey myself and i haven't had

2772
05:11:57,500 --> 05:12:04,940
honey in a long time because my mom likes to to put the honey in the federator and it's so hard

2773
05:12:04,940 --> 05:12:11,820
and doesn't come out of the bottle who federates honey i don't understand i had an argument with her about it

2774
05:12:13,500 --> 05:12:21,180
like why do you put fucking honey in the fridge it's so stupid it becomes like super hard

2775
05:12:21,660 --> 05:12:27,260
just put it take it out it should for honey shouldn't be federated

2776
05:12:29,180 --> 05:12:29,980
fight me on that

2777
05:12:34,140 --> 05:12:34,860
can't use it

2778
05:12:40,060 --> 05:12:45,900
they put honey in a fridge and they say some ketchup shouldn't be federated but i like ketchup

2779
05:12:45,900 --> 05:12:53,580
federated it turns all like vinegary and smells bad unless you shake it if you take it out of the

2780
05:12:53,580 --> 05:12:58,860
fridge they say ketchup shouldn't be federated but there are some ketchup bottles that they

2781
05:12:58,860 --> 05:13:04,460
federate after opening but there are some ketchup bottles that they don't federate but people just

2782
05:13:04,460 --> 05:13:13,180
don't read bottles anymore to make sure so they leave the ketchup um out of the fridge

2783
05:13:13,260 --> 05:13:18,620
i think it's it tastes horrible and sour

2784
05:13:22,140 --> 05:13:27,820
cold honey is cool yeah but you can't it won't it doesn't move but it becomes hard

2785
05:13:35,740 --> 05:13:40,300
honey literally cannot go bad so there's no need to federate honey there isn't

2786
05:13:41,260 --> 05:13:42,620
it doesn't need to be federated

2787
05:13:45,740 --> 05:13:54,380
use a high spec for the honey i have some honey lemon tea a few days ago my throat because i

2788
05:13:55,100 --> 05:13:58,220
was a discord carry okay hurt my throat

2789
05:14:01,020 --> 05:14:04,140
a honey lemon tea is great how much honey do you do

2790
05:14:10,940 --> 05:14:24,620
i have a hundred

2791
05:14:26,140 --> 05:14:30,780
a hundred teabags probably a little less than that now because i've drunk a couple a

2792
05:14:30,780 --> 05:14:37,900
couple of tea maybe like 80 something 80 teabags now

2793
05:14:47,100 --> 05:14:49,100
a hundred yeah a hundred

2794
05:14:53,100 --> 05:14:56,380
i don't like leaving my house like yeah i buy everything i need it

2795
05:14:56,460 --> 05:15:03,580
but what is the expiration date does it have one does tea actually expire i don't think tea

2796
05:15:03,580 --> 05:15:11,100
expires tea can't expire can it tea can't expire can it you really

2797
05:15:14,780 --> 05:15:17,100
this fire there's no expiration date on this

2798
05:15:20,620 --> 05:15:22,140
yeah it's not expiration date

2799
05:15:27,340 --> 05:15:33,100
oh there is an expiration date oh

2800
05:15:41,660 --> 05:15:49,100
i have till next year i'm fine it's fine i have till next year

2801
05:15:49,420 --> 05:16:01,820
i have till February of next year we're fine

2802
05:16:01,980 --> 05:16:04,540
okay

2803
05:16:13,420 --> 05:16:16,540
how long does it take hot chocolate to expire

2804
05:16:18,460 --> 05:16:23,020
i bought 150 of those i don't have the box i'm not gonna go look right now

2805
05:16:32,380 --> 05:16:38,220
next year can pass really quickly with the treasury of tea such as yours i recommend drinking

2806
05:16:38,220 --> 05:16:42,780
about two bags a day i get sick pretty cool frequently so it should be fine

2807
05:16:45,100 --> 05:16:56,540
i get sick very frequently so it'll be used

2808
05:17:01,900 --> 05:17:04,540
so

2809
05:17:14,700 --> 05:17:18,540
i still play with my partner about sauce in the fridge it's mind boggling

2810
05:17:21,980 --> 05:17:26,540
i think only some things should go in the fridge honestly

2811
05:17:32,540 --> 05:17:38,940
only some things honey should be refrigerated it should it should not be

2812
05:17:38,940 --> 05:17:43,580
refrigerated it doesn't say on the bottle that needs to be refrigerated literally google it

2813
05:17:43,580 --> 05:17:51,260
and it will tell you that not all honey needs to be refrigerated i only put some sauces it says

2814
05:17:51,260 --> 05:17:57,180
it on the bottles if it says on the bottle refrigerate after opening it i'm putting it in

2815
05:17:57,180 --> 05:18:04,220
the refrigerator all right it says recommended put in refrigerator after opening and it's gonna go

2816
05:18:04,220 --> 05:18:10,220
in the fridge all right if it says it i'm doing it

2817
05:18:15,900 --> 05:18:19,660
well this is nonsense when you suck it on the bottle read it

2818
05:18:27,500 --> 05:18:33,660
okay

2819
05:18:37,660 --> 05:18:44,140
am i worried you guys gonna have gross expired spoiled food and still eat it because the

2820
05:18:44,140 --> 05:18:50,460
expiration date says it doesn't expire well it doesn't expire until unless you treat it the

2821
05:18:50,460 --> 05:18:56,220
way it says to be treated you you that's like leaving milk out and then saying oh well the

2822
05:18:56,220 --> 05:19:01,020
expiration date says it doesn't expire until like next month but you just keep drinking it because

2823
05:19:01,020 --> 05:19:10,380
you left it out for like a day and yeah well i don't need to refrigerate it because it doesn't

2824
05:19:10,380 --> 05:19:14,780
say it needs to be refrigerated but everyone knows knows needs to be refrigerated so you

2825
05:19:14,780 --> 05:19:27,900
refrigerate the milk just because it's got just because some milk can survive without being

2826
05:19:27,900 --> 05:19:32,860
refrigerated doesn't mean not all milk because survive not being refrigerated the same goes for

2827
05:19:32,860 --> 05:19:39,500
most other foods if it says it on a bottle you do what it says because they know better than you do

2828
05:19:45,020 --> 05:19:49,660
that's like this one person i used to yell at me about refrigerating eggs

2829
05:19:54,780 --> 05:19:59,100
they're like oh but if it came from a chicken then it doesn't need to be refrigerated

2830
05:20:03,020 --> 05:20:07,500
the whole point of refrigerating most eggs was to stop fertilization

2831
05:20:14,780 --> 05:20:29,100

2834
05:20:59,860 --> 05:21:07,860
I think they had this whole mental of eat things as soon as you get it, but they didn't really understand the concept of storing food.

2835
05:21:09,860 --> 05:21:17,860
You put it in the fridge to keep it cold for a reason. You're keeping it cold for a reason.

2836
05:21:30,860 --> 05:21:35,860
You put it in the fridge to keep it cold for a reason.

2837
05:21:36,860 --> 05:21:41,860
Imagine leaving an egg out on the counter only to come home to a baby chick.

2838
05:21:47,860 --> 05:21:53,860
That has actually happened to some people where they had a, like a chickie.

2839
05:21:54,860 --> 05:21:59,860
It was like half formed in an egg because they left the egg out.

2840
05:22:00,860 --> 05:22:07,860
It was like halfly formed and then when they broke it open, like a chickie came out.

2841
05:22:13,860 --> 05:22:17,860
But it wasn't an alive chick though, unfortunately.

2842
05:22:24,860 --> 05:22:29,860
I think they stopped eating eggs after that.

2843
05:22:32,860 --> 05:22:36,860
Did they eat it? No, they were scared. They were shocked. They screamed.

2844
05:22:47,860 --> 05:22:52,860
I think they stopped eating eggs after that. I think it was very traumatizing for them.

2845
05:22:53,860 --> 05:22:58,860
I don't remember. I don't talk to them anymore.

2846
05:22:59,860 --> 05:23:05,860
I just heard that this year apparently fresh non-processed eggs can be kept out on a counter and be fine.

2847
05:23:06,860 --> 05:23:13,860
Yes, non-processed, non-processed, non-processed food can be left out.

2848
05:23:14,860 --> 05:23:19,860
The majority of it can, but not processed food. It does not work that way.

2849
05:23:19,860 --> 05:23:22,860
It does not work that way.

2850
05:23:34,860 --> 05:23:40,860
Some people just don't really do that much research to find out that it's not that way.

2851
05:23:41,860 --> 05:23:48,860
So they learn about this stuff online somewhere and then they never actually do self research to see if that information holds true.

2852
05:23:49,860 --> 05:23:52,860
For everything.

2853
05:23:53,860 --> 05:23:56,860
They just believe everything they hear and see.

2854
05:24:00,860 --> 05:24:02,860
You're guilty almost.

2855
05:24:04,860 --> 05:24:09,860
Do your research. Don't trust everything. So bully dilly.

2856
05:24:10,860 --> 05:24:14,860
Do your research. Oh my gosh, silly babies.

2857
05:24:15,860 --> 05:24:20,860
Do your research now.

2858
05:24:22,860 --> 05:24:25,860
Common sense is kind of eroded nowadays.

2859
05:24:27,860 --> 05:24:29,860
It's weird.

2860
05:24:30,860 --> 05:24:36,860
Well, I want to do a full-on zazu zazu zazu down.

2861

2863

2864
05:24:47,860 --> 05:24:57,860
