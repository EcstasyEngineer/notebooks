194
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,320
let me move this fan over here

195
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:35,760

196
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,120
i'm acting i'm i'm tucking that in the back of my head

197
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,280
let me nothing i might get a little copyright again

198
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,920
did you get hit with copyright because you sing just just random songs i get hit with

199
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,480
oh man copyrights they're not even of the like the people that actually do copyright the song

200
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:14,000
that don't belong to those people it's fake i know that's so dumb Jesus i i i would also sing a lot

201
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,280
like when i streamed on twitch i don't know i said twitch like i'm

202
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,280
i'm

203
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,240
yeah i sung like a lot on twitch it was my favorite thing to do and i would play music too

204
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,920
oh my god i'm gonna do your mod job for them but the thing on twitch is that you could

205
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:43,520
like what is it what do you do uh you could separate the audio like the complete audio so that

206
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:51,360
when you should go live on twitch they can't hear uh the music at all but they can hear the music

207
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:58,480
when you're live but it doesn't stay in the vod so the vod doesn't get muted yeah yeah youtube the

208
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:05,920
whole freaking vod gets muted yeah so you can't do that on youtube are you allowed to join yes you're

209
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:12,400
allowed to join you think we just have 42 friends with us

210
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:29,440
i'm not used to uh not singing i got used to it for me i kept getting demonetized um because of

211
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:36,720
because of my boobs so i literally had a smack so much like strani was showing me

212
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:44,320
her monetization versus mine and i was just like holy i was like ineligible ineligible ineligible

213
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,560
copyright ineligible limited ads limited ads limited and i was like but then i changed thumbnails

214
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:57,280
and stuff and i um i appealed a bunch and thankfully i was able to i wonder if i'll get

215
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,360
i want to stuff i'll get hit with that after probably yeah like you've been doing the right thing

216
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:10,960
with the the bread you have to cover your whole boob crack i changed it to the boob bubble tea

217
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,320
you changed it to boob a tea oh that's funny i have i just have the sign in front of my boobs

218
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:24,560
for you for today um yeah because it like it did make a difference if i didn't cover it all the way

219
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:30,240
if the boob boob thing was still there but hey i think we'll be getting cover-ups anyways so

220
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:38,400
very slow and i cannot wait i know i can button my shirt and maybe i can pop a button that'd be cool

221
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:46,560
cool toggle oh i thought you just love bread yeah she loves bread so much she's just stuck

222
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,000
it in between her boobs i love bread will you man it's the best thing that's how i chose it

223
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:01,200
i need uh monison to cut out a picture of the harem um so i could stick it on my boobs just have

224
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:08,240
you guys just wedged in between as a cover it's just funny how much the algorithm has changed because

225
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:17,200
like evident by azura's song covering beauty pie boobs and the thumbnail that used to be such a main

226
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:27,920
like thing like i struggled so hard singing that song really i had to do so many retakes

227
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:34,560
because i could not stop laughing like i would see it i would laugh i would sing it i would laugh

228
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:40,960
and it ended with me having to sing monotone because if i didn't sing monotone i would laugh

229
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,160
i know like people are like why do you sound like you're singing because you're trying not to wake

230
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:51,920
up your parents i'm like because i yeah i also couldn't take it seriously and i'm not a good singer so

231
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,480
that's what i'm like and and it's so hard to match up

232
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:08,640
um it's a hard to match a pitch of someone who also can't sing yeah that's the like yeah pretty can't sing right

233
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,240
william johnson can't sing like i can come i could probably like the next song i'm probably gonna cover

234
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:23,200
is like stacy's mom which i'll be able to sing because there's actual flow and yeah and most of the lines

235
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,080
that that were put in the song it's literally a few words masked masked together

236
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:35,280
and i have a lisp so pewdiepie's accent and my lisp do not mesh well

237
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,920
i thought it really was good though i thought yours and shawnee's were actually like all of her

238
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,040
things like yeah i did a lot of takes for mine and i was going insane listening to the song

239
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:55,520
over and over and over again um and then yeah i was i didn't even they sent me the edited version

240
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,520
i'm like yeah great because i was i'm like it's probably cringy as hell i'm not listening to this

241
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,640
i don't want to hear myself

242
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,760
it was fun though really fun experience yeah i like because of that i now i know what's involved

243
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,600
i really want to try harder and do a better cover you want to do one with me

244
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:26,960
what song i don't know that'd be cool though i don't know what's i don't know what we could do

245
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,920
can you i have a bunch of songs already on list that i want to do for covers

246
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:39,840
like i have a big list yeah a little bit yeah a little bit i'm like trying to think

247
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,480
a little bit it can't be high card rap like like extremely like

248
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,600
we're not covering rap god i'm not i'm not i'm not i don't wanna do

249
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,880
well what song would you think um you sounded like you didn't want to be there

250
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,440
what song what song would you guys want us to cover little john

251
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,480

252
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,080
little john is on the menu

253
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,680
you

254
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,240
in the club with mohommies and then it's just

255
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,760
i think it would be cool if we um did like an english cover of like as a

256
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,520
i could hear his music i was like uh

257
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,280
actually no i feel like i feel like k-pop girlies will come for us because i was gonna say a k-pop song

258
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:03,040
um i think because this because like we can just find a girl group of six and just pick a person and do the lines

259
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:11,040
flow rida shuddy got them apple bottom oh i'm gonna put a karaoke for next week i should do that

You should be scared. You should be very scared.

I got toast. I got some peanut butter and Nutella toast.

838
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:35,120
Usually I put some banana on it, but I don't have any banana.

839
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:45,120
I kept hearing about how people see her as mommy and all, but one of the first drinks.

840
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:48,120
I went to person involved or being concerned about our new toaster.

841
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:51,120
Yes, Azura is cute as fuck.

842
01:35:57,120 --> 01:36:01,120
All the girls have quite a bit of gat moe.

843
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,120
Moe, sorry.

844
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:10,120
Nutella, yeah, it's like a hazelnut spread.

845
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:23,120
Yeah, she's a cutesy caring type and then I'm the Sundari type.

846
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:32,120
Sundari, but you actually hate us.

847
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,120
I don't hate you guys.

848
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,120
Don't say that maybe.

849
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:38,120
I don't know.

850
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:40,120
I should think about it.

851
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:53,120
Sundari, but you actually beat us to death.

852
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:57,120
Yes, let me beat the shit out of you.

853
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:00,120
Azura has got meow.

854
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:02,120
I'll see myself.

855
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:06,120
Meow.

856
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,120
Oh, that was good.

857
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:14,120
I hate this affectionately.

858
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:22,120
Yeah, I got to keep you guessing, guys.

859
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:31,120
I'm going to sacrifice myself so Azura gets to the final round.

860
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:40,120
I don't know what she's getting as a snack.

861
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:44,120
I feel like she's getting some sort of fruit or crackers.

862
01:37:53,120 --> 01:38:02,120
Or toast, she just burns her toast.

863
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:09,120
Eating animation under her mouth.

864
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,120
It's actually just my mouth tracking.

865
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:21,120
I promise you, I don't chew with my mouth open,

866
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:25,120
but the model tracking picks it up as I'm being like...

867
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:45,120
I'm making rice ball.

868
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:48,120
You're making a rice ball?

869
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:52,120
That's not a snack, that's a whole ass rice ball.

870
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:00,120
How are you making it?

871
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:09,120
No, but rice balls are different in different places,

872
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:12,120
but what type of rice ball are you making?

873
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:16,120
For me, a rice ball, I think of Italian rice balls,

874
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:19,120
but you're probably doing a Japanese rice ball.

875
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:21,120
Most likely Japanese.

876
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:28,120
Yeah, but I don't have anything to put in it.

877
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:31,120
So you're literally just eating a ball of rice.

878
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:37,120
I tried to look for something to put in it,

879
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:39,120
and I set it up to put something in it,

880
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,120
and then I was like,

881
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:43,120
let me put something in it,

882
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:45,120
and then I don't have anything.

883
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:47,120
I could have put tuna in it,

884
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:49,120
but then I would have to go get it.

885
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,120
I was going to say,

886
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:53,120
do you have tuna, canned tuna,

887
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:55,120
and put tomato in it or something?

888
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:59,120
Rice ball filled with air.

889
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:05,120
No cheese.

890
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:08,120
My fridge is so empty.

891
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:10,120
So is mine.

892
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:16,120
I desperately need to go grocery shopping,

893
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:18,120
but I'm just way too lazy.

894
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:21,120
It's too much of an effort to get ready

895
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,120
just to go to the grocery store.

896
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:27,120
Oh my God, that's very relatable.

897
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:31,120
Let me go watch my hand.

898
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:34,120
I did this without a glove.

899
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:37,120
Gasp! She went in raw.

900
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:40,120
She went in raw.

901
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,120
Reminds me of this one,

902
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:53,120
Chinese mythology I learned.

903
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,120
Basically, the lead girl was supposed to slay a dragon.

904
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:57,120
She set up rice balls, so the dragon would be like,

905
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:59,120
ooh, snacks.

906
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:03,120
Rice is the best snack, all right?

907
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:07,120
I think I have some like Jasmine rice.

908
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:10,120
I'm chewing.

909
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,120
No glove, extra love.

910
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:34,120
Yeah, I love biryani rice.

911
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:37,120
Oh no, I broke this.

912
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:40,120
Oh no, that's not good.

913
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:43,120
My salt, the opening of my salt,

914
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:45,120
it can only open one way.

915
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:49,120
It's completely broken.

916
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:51,120
How did that happen?

917
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:53,120
I don't know, I think I stepped on it.

918
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:56,120
How did you step on it?

919
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:58,120
I don't know, I'm lazy,

920
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:00,120
and I never put things back on the top of my fridge,

921
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:02,120
and they end up on the floor.

922
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:05,120
Damn, bitch, you live like this?

923
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,120
I literally have my toaster on the floor.

924
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:12,120
Why is your toaster on the floor?

925
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:15,120
I have nowhere to put it.

926
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:18,120
I have nowhere to put it.

927
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:22,120
You don't have a counter to put it on?

928
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:28,120
Do you need to clean off your counter, Sarah?

929
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:32,120
If anyone can see how cluttered my room looked,

930
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:34,120
you'd be appalled.

931
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:39,120
I can't even look at my TV,

932
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:42,120
there's like things in front of it blocking it,

933
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:44,120
things hanging off of the TV.

934
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:47,120
I feel a little bit better, but the little,

935
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:49,120
little bit of clutter that's at my house,

936
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:51,120
I mostly picked up yesterday.

937
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:54,120
Squalor core, mama.

938
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:59,120
They literally just called you squalor core.

939
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:03,120
As there is a true knee, 100%.

940
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:09,120

945

Do it again?

946
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:31,120
Do you just have a bag of piss bottles?

947
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:33,120
What? No!

948
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:39,120

01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:25,960
I don't either

990
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:27,960
I just

991
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:29,960
I don't think YouTube likes brown people

992
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:30,960
I mean

993
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:57,960
For those who don't know I am brown

994
01:46:58,960 --> 01:46:59,960
Me and Azura

995
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:01,960
Are you one and only

996
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:04,960
Actually no there is one girl in a different company that's brown

997
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:09,960
We are your brown chubas

998
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:10,960
I know I can't

999
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:13,960
I've said a lot of things before the brown toggle

1000
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:16,960
It's not even bad

1001
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:17,960
It's not even bad

1002
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:18,960
Relax

1003
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,960
It's fine

1004
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,960
She didn't even have to cover up her tatas bro

1005
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:24,960
It's not fair

1006
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:25,960
Yeah

1007
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:27,960
It's literally

1008
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:30,960
The reason why we're both getting demonetized is because

1009
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,960
Me and Azura have giant titties

1010
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:37,960
And I just started covering up mine in the thumbnails

1011
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:40,960
And so then I was able to get monetized

1012
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:43,960
And I don't have copyright issues like you have

1013
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:44,960
That's another thing

1014
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:46,960
Thank you for the gift dude

1015
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,960
Much thanks

1016
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:52,960
She had to throw that one last jab in

1017
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,960
I'm just saying

1018
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:57,960
I was wondering that

1019
01:47:57,960 --> 01:47:58,960
Excuse me I was wondering that too though

1020
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,960
Because I'm like why the hell

1021
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:03,960
Was Azura getting monetized for me

1022
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:07,960
And then I remember you talking about the copyright strikes

1023
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:08,960
In Discord

1024
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:10,960
And I was like okay that makes a little bit more sense then

1025
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:11,960
Because

1026
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:12,960
Yeah

1027
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,960
The only copyright I got was for

1028
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:17,960
The Vampire the Masquerade music

1029
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:19,960
And I was pissed about that

1030
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:21,960
Because it's literally the club asylum music

1031
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,960
And I'm like why would I get copyrighted on that?

1032
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,960
So I disputed it because it's fucking stupid

1033
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:29,960
It isn't fair

1034
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:30,960
It isn't fair

1035
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:33,960
And they can't dispute the copyright strikes

1036
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:38,960
Because they're the scammers

1037
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:39,960
Yeah

1038
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:44,960
So all you can do is like mute it and wait

1039
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:48,960
Mute, wait and hopefully YouTube will like hit them

1040
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:53,960
For being, for faking a copyright

1041
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:54,960
Yeah

1042
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:58,960
So even though Azura doesn't have memberships open

1043
01:48:58,960 --> 01:48:59,960
Is a monetized yet

1044
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:03,960
You could still support her by once a month

1045
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:05,960
Giving five dollars

1046
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:09,960
On her Patreon

1047
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:11,960
And through streamelevance

1048
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:16,960
By her merch

1049
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,960
By my merch

1050
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:21,960
Come support me please

1051
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:22,960
I need it

1052
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:23,960
Yeah I need it

1053
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:28,960
Azura's info

1054
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,960
Is in the description below

1055
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:32,960
Please go to her channel

1056
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:34,960
Like, comment, subscribe

1057
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:38,960
Smash her two giant brown like buttons

1058
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:43,960
If I pay you fifteen dollars will you clean your room?

1059
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:44,960
So much so

1060
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:45,960
Aw shit

1061
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:50,960
Yeah

1062
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:52,960
Ring her bell

1063
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:53,960
You gotta ring her bell too

1064
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:55,960
Make sure you ring her bell

1065
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:57,960
Yeah, I'll do that

1066
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:10,960
I have so many plates in here

1067
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:15,960
I got my bed frame in

1068
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:18,960
And I, cause I've been sleeping on a mattress on my floor

1069
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:21,960
In my apartment for like almost two years now

1070
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:25,960
And just like me and my cats in my bed

1071
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:27,960
And so I have to go downstairs

1072
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,960
Bring up this, go to the bathroom

1073
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:31,960
Bring up several flights

1074
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:33,960
Thankfully we have an elevator

1075
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:37,960
And then I don't know how I'm gonna move my mattress

1076
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:39,960
And then build the thing

1077
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:41,960
And then put the mattress on top of my bed

1078
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:43,960
It is so fucking heavy

1079
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:45,960
It's a lot of work

1080
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:47,960
Just put the mattress on the floor

1081
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:50,960
But like it's not good to have a mattress on the floor

1082
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:53,960
Because the moisture and the heat from your body

1083
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:55,960
Cause the floor is carpeted

1084
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:57,960
Oh, you have carpet

1085
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:58,960
Yeah

1086
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:01,960
I never had a mattress before that

1087
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:03,960
I didn't have a mattress before that

1088
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:05,960
So I slept on my floor

1089
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:07,960
And I don't have carpet

1090
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:08,960
Oh, ow

1091
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:10,960
Could you have a bed roll or something

1092
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,960
No, I just slept on a sheet

1093
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,960
And a blanket

1094
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:16,960
Oh

1095
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,960
Somebody buy her a bed

1096
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:22,960
Well, get it out of her house right now

1097
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,960
She needs her own place

1098
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:25,960
I have a bed now

1099
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:28,960
One of my family members lent me a mattress

1100
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:30,960
Yeah, but you need a...

1101
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:31,960
They lent it to you?

1102
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:33,960
Do they have to give it back?

1103
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:35,960
Do you have to give it back to them?

1104
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:36,960
No

1105
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:40,960
They gave me a mattress

1106
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,960
Why?

1107
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:46,960
Please

1108
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:49,960
For only the small amount

1109
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:51,960
Of five dollars a month

1110
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:55,960
You can support your favorite brown vtuber, Izura

1111
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:57,960
Thank you so much for the ten

1112
01:51:57,960 --> 01:51:59,960
No, not of us

1113
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:02,960
Please get her out of that

1114
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:04,960
Please let her have her own apartment

1115
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,960
So she could be

1116
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:08,960
As messy as she wants to

1117
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:12,960
Five dollars

1118
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,960
I have to put a bed roll

1119
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:17,960
Yeah, so I have to figure out

1120
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:19,960
I might have to ask my dad and my mom for help

1121
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:21,960
Or maybe some friends because I cannot

1122
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:23,960
The bed is way too heavy

1123
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:25,960
It's fucking huge

1124
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:29,960
They will like cleaning ASMR

1125
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:32,960
That would actually be cool

1126
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:34,960
You could do a twitter space

1127
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:36,960
And you could just ramble and chat while you clean your room

1128
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:38,960
That's actually might help you

1129
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,960
I might have ADHD

1130
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:43,960
Well, they can help you stay on

1131
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:45,960
Focus

1132
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:48,960
For me, I have to have something

1133
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,960
Playing in the background

1134
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:51,960
Yeah, like music

1135
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:53,960
Yeah, otherwise it can't focus

1136
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:58,960
We need a dono goal

1137
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:01,960
Yeah, Izura, you need to make a dono goal

1138
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:03,960
On your throne saying get me out of my house

1139
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:06,960
And then just put the first and last month of rent

1140
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:08,960
For wherever you are

1141
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:11,960
For the goal

1142
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:13,960
Maybe the donathon that I'm going to have

1143
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:14,960
For my birthday

1144
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:16,960
Oh true, your birthday

1145
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:18,960
It's August, right?

1146
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,960
Yeah, August 21

1147
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,960
Yeah

1148
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,960
Mark out on your calendars, ladies and gentlemen

1149
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:26,960
Yeah, come to my birthday

1150
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,960
Come and celebrate with me

1151
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:30,960
I'm very excited

1152
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:32,960
Because you'll be the first one of us to have a donathon

1153
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:34,960
Yeah

1154
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:36,960
We're gonna stay up longer

1155
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:38,960
Oh, and yeah, I think mine's after yours

1156
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:40,960
Because I'm September 28

1157
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:42,960
So

1158
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:44,960
Scary

1159
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,960
I might try to do a 24 hour

1160
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,960
I have to talk to Strani about it

1161
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,960
Like an actual 24 hours

1162
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:52,960
I think all of us are doing 24 hours, no

1163
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,960
But not like 12 hours a day

1164
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:56,960
But like continuous streaming

1165
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:58,960
Yeah, like for 24 hours

1166
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:00,960
That's what I was gonna do

1167
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:02,960
Oh, fuck yeah, okay, perfect

1168
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:04,960
Sounds like so confused

1169
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:06,960
I'm not supposed to do that

1170
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:08,960
No, sometimes people say they do like a 24 hour

1171
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:10,960
Donathon, but then they break it up over a couple

1172
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:12,960
Days

1173
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:14,960
True

1174
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:16,960
So, yeah

1175
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,960
So we

1176
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:20,960
But like I think

1177
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,960
We're kind of known for

1178
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:24,960
We do a lot of endurance stuff

1179
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:26,960
Between me, actually everybody I think has done

1180
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:28,960
At least one endurance stream

1181
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:30,960
I think

1182
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:32,960
I'm not quite sure

1183
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:34,960
Yeah, I don't even know what I want to do for my

1184
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:36,960
Donathon

1185
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:38,960
I have a few plans to do

1186
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,960
But I'm gonna do a Zatsu

1187
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:42,960
We're all gonna chat about what we're gonna do

1188
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:44,960
What they want me to do

1189
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,960
What they do with ideas and stuff

1190
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:48,960
We have a few already

1191
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,960
So what I'm going to

1192
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,960
Dooring the Donathon is what I don't know

1193
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:54,960
Yeah, there's somebody

1194
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:56,960
That's so far behind in your VOD

1195
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:58,960
And it's really funny because they just responded with

1196
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:00,960
Lent you like with the bed thing

1197
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:02,960
Let me talk about it 10 minutes ago

1198
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:06,960
This one

1199
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:08,960
Poor thing

1200
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:10,960
Yeah, VODs end at 12 hours

1201
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:12,960
So yeah, they'll have to be two parts

1202
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:14,960
But I think it'll be cool

1203
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:16,960
Yeah

1204
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:18,960
I do that and then in the 12th part

1205
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:20,960
You can take a breakie

1206
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,960
Before the next one

1207
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:24,960
You can do like a smoke breakie

1208
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:26,960
I didn't say that

1209
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:28,960
I didn't say that

1210
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:30,960
I didn't say that

1211
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,960
A small breakie

1212
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:34,960
That's what you said

1213
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:36,960
I'm sorry

1214
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:38,960
I'm sorry

1215
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:40,960
I totally misheard

1216
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:42,960
I was like A.O

1217
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:44,960
Imagine

1218
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:46,960
Like Azura dressed as like

1219
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:48,960
A beautiful 1920s flapper

1220
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,960
With one of those cool

1221
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:52,960
Cigarette holders in her mouth

1222
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:54,960
And she's like hey dawg

1223
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:56,960
She was talking about cigarettes

1224
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:58,960
I thought she was talking about something else

1225
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:00,960
Entirely different

1226
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,960
Bro, we are not on the same page

1227
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:14,960
I'm like laughing behind you

1228
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:18,960
I was just like

1229
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:20,960
Sultry cigarettes

1230
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:22,960
After copulation

1231
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:24,960
I didn't talk about

1232
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,960
You know grass

1233
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:30,960
Like outside

1234
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,960
Okay, what?

1235
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:44,960
I love struggling to breathe

1236
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:48,960
The dank grass

1237
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:50,960
What?

1238
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:56,960
I got it

1239
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:58,960
I understand now

1240
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:02,960
I get it, I'm smart

1241
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:04,960
The devil's lettuce

1242
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:06,960
Indeed

1243
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:12,960
Whoops

1244
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,960
I think I killed Azura

1245
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:20,960
The wacky tobacco

1246
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:24,960
The sticky icky

1247
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,960
Okay

1248
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:46,960
Azura breathes

1249
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:50,960
Like

1250
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:52,960
The za

1251
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:54,960
Like pizza

1252
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:56,960
Like I

1253
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:58,960
When people say za I think of pizza

1254
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:00,960
Like you want to grab a slice of za

1255
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:06,960
I can't tell either

1256
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,960
If she's kidding

1257
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:10,960
She's not so far away like she ran across the room to cry

1258
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:16,960
She be here's blinker

1259
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:18,960
What's

1260
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,960
What the fuck is a blinker

1261
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:22,960
I'm thinking about cars

1262
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:24,960
I don't

1263
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:26,960
They call it, what's a

1264
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:28,960
Is that like

1265
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:30,960
I've never heard of that

1266
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:32,960
I've never heard that called that

1267
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:40,960
When you hit a vape for long enough

1268
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:42,960
And the light starts blink

1269
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:44,960
Like

1270
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:46,960
I have friends that smoke vapes

1271
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:48,960
And stuff

1272
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:50,960
I didn't know that was a thing

1273
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:58,960
Wait till

1274
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:00,960
I'll expose myself more right now

1275
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:02,960
A part of me

1276
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:04,960
Was very thankful

1277
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:06,960
That nobody recalled

1278
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:08,960
In my past life

1279
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:10,960
That I sat during a stream

1280
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:12,960
For about an hour

1281
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:14,960
Debating male anatomy

1282
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:16,960
With my viewers because I thought

1283
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:20,960
I thought

1284
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:24,960
That

1285
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:26,960
The little

1286
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:28,960
You know beans in the sack

1287
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:30,960
Were on

1288
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:32,960
Like behind your legs

1289
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:36,960
And that's why you had to like

1290
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:38,960
Manspray

1291
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:40,960
And I remember just like complaining

1292
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:42,960
Because I'm just like

1293
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:44,960
Men's anatomy is just so weird

1294
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:46,960
Because it's like why is it on the front like that

1295
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:50,960
And I thought it was because I'm thinking about like

1296
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:52,960
In terms of like the distance of like a woman's

1297
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,960
Stuff and a man's stuff

1298
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:56,960
I'm like isn't okay is the ball in between

1299
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:58,960
The leg like

1300
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:02,960
And so I remember I was drawing

1301
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:04,960
My example for people

1302
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:06,960
And they were just like kind of doing

1303
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:08,960
What's happening now

1304
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:10,960
And I was

1305
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:12,960
And I don't know

1306
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:14,960
Why I thought that because it's not like I don't

1307
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:16,960
Like I don't want stuff so I'm just

1308
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:18,960
But I'd like

1309
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:20,960
You know

1310
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:22,960
I'm just going to stop talking

1311
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:28,960
You want me to draw it again?

1312
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:38,960
Yeah

1313
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:44,960
Oh god she's drawing it

1314
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:46,960
I gotta see this

1315
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:48,960
I gotta see this

1316
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:50,960
I'll show you

1317
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:52,960
What I need

1318
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:56,960
I need to see this

1319
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:00,960
People forget

1320
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,960
I grew up in a very religious Christian household

1321
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:08,960
Cool

1322
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:10,960
I'm sweating so bad

1323
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:18,960
Wait they actually taught you

1324
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:20,960
Like they actually taught you

1325
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:22,960
I thought like you were like in a religious household

1326
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:24,960
Where like they like kept you away from them

1327
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:26,960
Because my mom

1328
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:28,960
My parents were like we don't want you getting molested

1329
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:30,960
So like here's some information

1330
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:34,960
And they're like if somebody asks you to do this

1331
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:36,960
Don't do it

1332
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:38,960
But I don't even remember my sex ed class

1333
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:40,960
In high school like I'll be honest with you

1334
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:42,960
Like I think I might have like blanked

1335
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:44,960
That out for my own mental health

1336
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:46,960
And safety

1337
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:48,960
Yeah pretty decent parents

1338
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:50,960
Telling you that early age

1339
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:52,960
Oh yeah yeah yeah

1340
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:54,960
Being a girl and an only child

1341
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:56,960
They didn't want me to get like

1342
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:58,960
Diddle by someone in church or whatever

1343
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:00,960
So

1344
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:02,960
Every time she hits me with these like

1345
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:04,960
Terms

1346
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:06,960
It really shocks me

1347
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:10,960
So this is the head of the dude

1348
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:12,960
And he's just hanging out

1349
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:14,960
And then I'm going to do this from the side

1350
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:16,960
So I'm going to

1351
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:18,960
This is his leg

1352
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:20,960
Wait we can't see

1353
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:22,960
We can't see it

1354
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:24,960
What do you mean you can't see it

1355
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:26,960
Oh wait I'm delayed nevermind

1356
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:28,960
Don't worry about me

1357
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:30,960
Okay and so I thought

1358
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:34,960
Um

1359
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:36,960
I kind of made his leg too thick

1360
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:38,960
Don't worry about it

1361
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:40,960
I thought like this is the butt

1362
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:42,960
And

1363
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:44,960
Let me get this one

1364
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:46,960
How do I make this bigger

1365
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:48,960
Damn look at that cake

1366
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:50,960
I know he's kind of he's caked up

1367
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:52,960
He's caked up

1368
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:54,960
So

1369
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:56,960
I thought

1370
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,960
Like a guy's stuff was over here

1371
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:00,960
Like that's where the peepee is

1372
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:02,960
Where the balls are

1373
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:04,960
Because they're like in between the legs

1374
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:06,960
But then

1375
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:08,960
Come to find out

1376
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:10,960
They're actually like weirdly at the front

1377
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:12,960
And I just think that's stupid

1378
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:14,960
Because as a woman

1379
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:16,960
You know you have like

1380
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:18,960
There's like too much space between asshole

1381
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:20,960
And the balls

1382
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:22,960
I just think it's dumb

1383
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:24,960
Whereas as a woman your stuff is just like down here

1384
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:26,960
All chilling

1385
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:28,960
And then you got your asshole

1386
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:30,960
Like

1387
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:32,960
The space between

1388
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:34,960
A man's asshole and the balls

1389
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:36,960
You want to pin

1390
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:38,960
What

1391
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:40,960
Do you want to pinch it

1392
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:42,960
I've heard it's called the Gooch

1393
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:44,960
Yes the Gooch existence

1394
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:46,960
I think it's stupid

1395
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:48,960
I don't like men anatomy

1396
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:50,960
I feel like their stuff should be a little bit different

1397
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:52,960
But yeah the women's stuff is there

1398
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:54,960
So I'm just like

1399
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:56,960
Like I feel like I could just pop this off

1400
02:03:56,960 --> 02:03:58,960
And make you a kendall

1401
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:00,960
And then your asshole is all the way over here

1402
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:02,960
Like I don't understand it it's stupid

1403
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:04,960
Like there's too much space

1404
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:06,960
There's too much distance

1405
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:12,960
I think the reason why the tack is on the front like that

1406
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:14,960
Because it's the root of where it grew

1407
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:16,960
What

1408
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:20,960
Anatomy was

1409
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:22,960
Guys stop

1410
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:24,960
I thought that prostate was like inside

1411
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,960
Yeah isn't that inside

1412
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:28,960
Yeah the prostate is inside

1413
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:30,960
Yeah that's in like

1414
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:32,960
You got the booty hole and then it's like

1415
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:34,960
Because the man's geospot is literally in their booty hole

1416
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:36,960
Yeah

1417
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:38,960
And then I know like they can also get there

1418
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:40,960
With like sounding and stuff

1419
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:42,960
Which is terrifying by the way

1420
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:46,960
P is stored in the balls

1421
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:48,960
That's true

1422
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:50,960
You know I remember when I was younger

1423
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:52,960
In mind you again I was probably like 5

1424
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:54,960
And they got me about like

1425
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:56,960
Like how to make sure that I'm not being taken advantage of

1426
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:58,960
So I don't remember a lot

1427
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:00,960
Because they bought me like a whole ass anatomy book

1428
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:02,960
And they also got me a little book

1429
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:04,960
I think it's called

1430
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:06,960
The caring keeping of you

1431
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:08,960
Which is really cool for like girls who are going through puberty

1432
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:10,960
But like I also

1433
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:12,960
It took me a while to figure out where my pee hole was

1434
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:14,960
Because I thought I peed out of my clit for the longest time

1435
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:16,960
But I discovered that wasn't the case

1436
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:18,960
Are you serious?

1437
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:20,960
Damn what's going on

1438
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:22,960
Was I just

1439
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:24,960
Was I just that exploratory

1440
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:26,960
When I was younger

1441
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:28,960
I knew all of this from the get

1442
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:30,960
Like what do you mean vods cooked

1443
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:32,960
Vods fine

1444
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:34,960
This is educational purposes

1445
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:36,960
Yes educational

1446
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,960
Educational purposes

1447
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:40,960
Educational purposes

1448
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:44,960
Precisely

1449
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:46,960
I'm getting educated

1450
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:48,960
Well I've been educated

1451
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:50,960
But like this was probably a couple months ago

1452
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:54,960
What just happened excuse me

1453
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:00,960
I think I was just very exploratory

1454
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,960
Just overall with anatomy

1455
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:04,960
As a whole since I was very very young

1456
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:06,960
But it's funny cause like

1457
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:08,960
I would draw in stuff

1458
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:10,960
But I didn't draw like that stuff

1459
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:12,960
And then like I would read like

1460
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:14,960
Yeah and like watch stuff

1461
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:16,960
Like a little fuji

1462
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:18,960
There's no way that you watch

1463
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:20,960
Yahweh

1464
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:22,960
And didn't understand the anatomy

1465
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:24,960
Of the

1466
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:26,960
Of the boobda

1467
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:28,960
I think it was like object permanence

1468
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:30,960
I don't know like I just thought

1469
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:32,960
It like moves around more often

1470
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,960
But it's really just tack to the front

1471
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:36,960
And I thought you could like tuck it

1472
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:38,960
Like that's why I'm like oh guys can tuck

1473
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:40,960
If they don't want to like show

1474
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:42,960
How much they're packing you know

1475
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:44,960
You know

1476
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,960
Am I just embarrassing myself

1477
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:50,960
Why am I in the poor corpo

1478
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:52,960
Of the anatomy

1479
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:58,960
I was curious since day one

1480
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:00,960
I really thought that when they showed you the

1481
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:02,960
The you know the

1482
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:04,960
Sacky wacky

1483
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:06,960
Can't call it a Sacky wacky

1484
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:10,960
When they showed you it in the pictures

1485
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:12,960
I always thought it was like an egg

1486
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:14,960
And I kept thinking of packing it

1487
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:16,960
So I was very curious

1488
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:18,960
And like

1489
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:20,960
Because like

1490
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:22,960
Their stuff is on the inside

1491
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:24,960
I thought it was

1492
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:26,960
I didn't know there was like holding stuff on the inside

1493
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:28,960
I thought it was like the organ itself

1494
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:30,960
Like I didn't like the sack is holding the testies

1495
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:32,960
I just thought it was like

1496
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:34,960
It was the testies just covered in skin

1497
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:38,960
Don't crack it everybody is terrified

1498
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:40,960
Of you cracking the nuts

1499
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:42,960
Oh say crack the nuts

1500
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:44,960
Yeah

1501
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:46,960
I always thought it was

1502
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:48,960
It would actually crack

1503
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:50,960
When I was younger I was like

1504
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:52,960
I accidentally kicked someone

1505
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:54,960
A long time ago

1506
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:56,960
It was an accident

1507
02:07:56,960 --> 02:07:58,960
I didn't do it on purpose

1508
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:00,960
Believe me

1509
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:02,960
Believe me

1510
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:04,960
It wasn't on purpose

1511
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:06,960
I remember when I was younger

1512
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:08,960
I was playing tag with friends

1513
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:10,960
At recess

1514
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:12,960
I don't know if any European friends know what recess is

1515
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:14,960
But just like break time

1516
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:16,960
From after lunch and stuff

1517
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:18,960
And we were playing tag

1518
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:20,960
And this one kid jumped off of a

1519
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:22,960
We had like these like benches

1520
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:24,960
And he jumped off of it

1521
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:26,960
And I went to go tag him

1522
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:28,960
And I ended up punching him in the nuts

1523
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:30,960
As he jumped off

1524
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:32,960
And he just started crying

1525
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:34,960
And I being a girl

1526
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:36,960
Called him a little bitch because I'm like

1527
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:38,960
Why the fuck do you cry cause like I've taken

1528
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:40,960
I've taken shots to the pussy

1529
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:42,960
You know

1530
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:44,960
There's no way because I remember

1531
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:46,960
When I was younger I fell

1532
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:48,960
You know those old wooden beds

1533
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:50,960
Oh yeah

1534
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:52,960
I fell on one

1535
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:54,960
Yeah I fell on the headboard

1536
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:56,960
Like I was fucking with it

1537
02:08:56,960 --> 02:08:58,960
Cause you know I was like a badass child

1538
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:00,960
When I was little I was like running around

1539
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:02,960
Jumping on the bed and like on the board

1540
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:04,960
And like doing flips and shit

1541
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:06,960
And then I slipped

1542
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:08,960
And I fell in between on the bed

1543
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:10,960
And ran between my legs

1544
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:12,960
No that shit hurt

1545
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:14,960
Like I thought I broke bone

1546
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:16,960
I thought I cracked bone

1547
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:18,960
Does that mean my pussy can take more of a pound

1548
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:20,960
I don't know bro

1549
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:22,960
Cause there's no fucking way that you didn't feel shit

1550
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:24,960
There's no way

1551
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:26,960
Okay the only time

1552
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:28,960
The only time it hurt

1553
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:30,960
The only time it's hurt for me

1554
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:32,960
Nobody really does that a lot

1555
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:34,960
The only time it's hurt for me

1556
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:36,960
I'm gonna draw

1557
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:38,960
This is educational

1558
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:40,960
So like you know there's like

1559
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:42,960
The pubic bone like up here

1560
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:44,960
Or it's like your lippies are right there

02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:46,960
It's like this bone

1562
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:48,960
I had there was a girl that like

1563
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:50,960
This looks like a bush

1564
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:52,960
There was a girl that cut this out

1565
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:54,960
Like right there

1566
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:56,960

1567
02:09:56,960 --> 02:09:58,960
Her music case that had like her clarinet

1568
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:00,960
Or something and it hit me right at the bone

1569
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:02,960
This one is nuked

1570
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:04,960
And I'm just cutting this out

1571
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:06,960
Don't worry about it

1572
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:08,960
And it hurt so bad

1573
02:10:08,960 --> 02:10:10,960

I fell so bad for my cat, but my cat was a thrasher too.

1927
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:47,560
We'd sleep and he'd sleep on my chest.

1928
02:44:47,560 --> 02:44:51,560
And he'd sleep and I'd lay there like sprawled out.

1929
02:44:51,560 --> 02:44:54,560
And he'd be like on my chest, sprawled out.

1930
02:44:57,560 --> 02:45:00,560
And we'd sleep like that and he'd snore.

1931
02:45:00,560 --> 02:45:03,560
My cat was a snorer, he'd snore and he'd be like...

1932
02:45:06,560 --> 02:45:11,560
Shuu. Shuu. Shuu.

1933
02:45:13,560 --> 02:45:16,560
You ever heard a cat snore before?

1934
02:45:26,560 --> 02:45:30,560
He'll say lucky cat, but he was a good boy.

1935
02:45:30,560 --> 02:45:33,560
I miss him very dearly.

1936
02:45:36,560 --> 02:45:39,560
My cat had a whistle in his snore.

1937
02:45:39,560 --> 02:45:44,560
Instead of like a shuu, it would come out like...

1938
02:45:50,560 --> 02:45:53,560
Are you ending? And like 15 minutes.

1939
02:45:53,560 --> 02:45:54,560

1940
02:45:58,560 --> 02:46:00,560

1942
02:46:22,560 --> 02:46:24,560

1943
02:46:31,560 --> 02:46:33,560

1944
02:46:37,560 --> 02:46:40,560
You're gonna read?

1945
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:45,560
If you have anyone else you can want to, can or want to read, you can do that.

1946
02:46:45,560 --> 02:46:47,560
That's fine.

1947
02:46:47,560 --> 02:46:49,560
I end in 15 minutes.

1948
02:46:49,560 --> 02:46:51,560
I start stream back up in an hour.

1949
02:46:51,560 --> 02:46:54,560
I'm gonna take like an hour break before I start stream back up.

1950
02:46:55,560 --> 02:47:00,560
So, if you have anyone else to read, recommend reading them.

1951
02:47:00,560 --> 02:47:02,560
I'm not.

1952
02:47:06,560 --> 02:47:09,560

1953
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:14,560

1954
02:47:16,560 --> 02:47:18,560

1955
02:47:21,560 --> 02:47:23,560

1956
02:47:23,560 --> 02:47:24,560
No.

1957
02:47:25,560 --> 02:47:27,560
No, I did not.

1958
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:31,560
I did not.

1959
02:47:31,560 --> 02:47:35,560
Someone asked me that I'm the morrow.

1960
02:47:35,560 --> 02:47:39,560
Someone literally asked me that I'm the morrow.

1961
02:47:58,560 --> 02:48:00,560
And I was like...

1962
02:48:11,560 --> 02:48:14,560
I've answered quite a few morrows too, so that's good.

1963
02:48:14,560 --> 02:48:16,560
They're all public.

1964
02:48:16,560 --> 02:48:19,560
So you just scroll down the page, you can see everything I've answered.

1965
02:48:19,560 --> 02:48:25,560
If anyone had questions that are similar to a lot of the people in the morrows, you could see those there.

1966

02:52:52,500 --> 02:53:06,500
and then like so then they just piled up and then they were like okay we'll just switch you back to whatever and I was like okay and then I just have an enema medication on my floor

2027
02:53:06,500 --> 02:53:08,500
I don't know what to do with it

2028
02:53:15,500 --> 02:53:19,500
what do I do with this, this here, this here

2029
02:53:23,500 --> 02:53:24,500
I don't know

2030
02:53:25,500 --> 02:53:30,500
it's either I take it because they said I could still continue to take it I finish it

2031
02:53:30,500 --> 02:53:37,500
like I take it I finish it or I don't know just throw it out do you just throw it on the trash

2032
02:53:38,500 --> 02:53:40,500
do you just throw it on the trash

2033
02:53:41,500 --> 02:53:42,500
and then it's like

2034
02:53:43,500 --> 02:53:48,500
I have clothes but the clothes isn't an issue because I have like bags for those

2035
02:53:48,500 --> 02:53:53,500
and I just throw those in a pile and I re-wash clothes because I don't go outside anyways

2036
02:53:53,500 --> 02:53:55,500
so I like rarely wear anything

2037
02:54:02,500 --> 02:54:04,500
I really wear these things

2038
02:54:04,500 --> 02:54:06,500
I don't know just take it

2039
02:54:07,500 --> 02:54:15,500
throw it in a pile and then wash it and then put it away and then pull it back out again

2040
02:54:22,500 --> 02:54:24,500
my room used to be so clean

2041
02:54:26,500 --> 02:54:31,500
but then it got so bad once I got into violor

2042
02:54:31,500 --> 02:54:33,500
I don't know what happened

2043
02:54:35,500 --> 02:54:38,500
it just it just kept getting worse

2044
02:54:39,500 --> 02:54:42,500
I don't know what happened

2045
02:54:46,500 --> 02:54:49,500
it was like semi clean it was lately better

2046
02:54:50,500 --> 02:54:55,500
I had space to walk in now you can only walk in a straight line to get into my room and out

2047
02:54:56,500 --> 02:54:58,500
there's so much stuff in the way

2048
02:55:04,500 --> 02:55:07,500
room got as dirty as your mind

2049
02:55:11,500 --> 02:55:13,500
lack of time most likely

2050
02:55:14,500 --> 02:55:17,500
I spent ever since I got into violor I spent like

2051
02:55:18,500 --> 02:55:22,500
like a majority of the time sleeping

2052
02:55:22,500 --> 02:55:24,500
just sleeping

2053
02:55:24,500 --> 02:55:26,500
I've been so tired

2054
02:55:28,500 --> 02:55:30,500
so tired

2055
02:55:30,500 --> 02:55:32,500
I just sleep

2056
02:55:34,500 --> 02:55:36,500
sleep

2057
02:55:42,500 --> 02:55:47,500
damn my neighbors are being jerks right now

2058
02:56:05,500 --> 02:56:07,500
hahaha

2059
02:56:15,500 --> 02:56:18,500
I thought the gremlin thing was just a quirky thing

2060
02:56:18,500 --> 02:56:22,500
now you are actually a gremlin

2061
02:56:22,500 --> 02:56:24,500
I'm a gremlin

2062
02:56:24,500 --> 02:56:26,500
for real for real

2063
02:56:27,500 --> 02:56:29,500
I'm an actual gremlin

2064
02:56:29,500 --> 02:56:32,500
I'm an anime nerded gremlin

2065
02:56:32,500 --> 02:56:35,500
and spent most of my time watching anime

2066
02:56:35,500 --> 02:56:38,500
scared to socialize with humans

2067
02:56:41,500 --> 02:56:43,500
humans are scary

2068
02:56:43,500 --> 02:56:45,500
scary human

2069
02:56:46,500 --> 02:56:48,500
wow

2070
02:56:49,500 --> 02:56:51,500
I want to do a room cleaning

2071
02:56:51,500 --> 02:56:54,500
a room cleaning ASMR

2072
02:56:56,500 --> 02:57:00,500
like a Zatsudan room cleaning ASMR

2073
02:57:02,500 --> 02:57:04,500
sleep stream

2074
02:57:14,500 --> 02:57:17,500
sleep stream where viewers can send in videos

2075
02:57:17,500 --> 02:57:21,500
yes yes maybe possibly we'll have to have someone go through

2076
02:57:23,500 --> 02:57:26,500
we'd probably end up doing a sleep stream on the

2077
02:57:26,500 --> 02:57:28,500
on the tonothon

2078
02:57:29,500 --> 02:57:31,500
probably maybe

2079
02:57:31,500 --> 02:57:33,500
possibly

2080
02:57:36,500 --> 02:57:38,500
or

2081
02:57:38,500 --> 02:57:43,500
or it would be in two parts since stream stops at 12 hours

2082
02:57:43,500 --> 02:57:46,500
it would be in two parts I stay awake for 12 hours

2083
02:57:46,500 --> 02:57:48,500
and then

2084
02:57:49,500 --> 02:57:52,500
in between the mark I go to sleep

2085
02:57:52,500 --> 02:57:54,500
and then I wake up

2086
02:57:54,500 --> 02:57:56,500
I wake up

2087
02:57:58,500 --> 02:58:03,500
and then stream the next part

2088
02:58:03,500 --> 02:58:05,500
wow I'm actually getting really tired

2089
02:58:05,500 --> 02:58:07,500
holy moly

2090
02:58:12,500 --> 02:58:14,500
holy moly

2091
02:58:16,500 --> 02:58:18,500
I'm gonna have to look after you

2092
02:58:18,500 --> 02:58:20,500
you don't I'm fine

2093
02:58:21,500 --> 02:58:23,500
I'm a big girl

2094
02:58:23,500 --> 02:58:25,500
I'm fine

2095
02:58:26,500 --> 02:58:28,500
you know

2096
02:58:28,500 --> 02:58:30,500
mothers are very motherly

2097
02:58:30,500 --> 02:58:33,500
but even mothers have their days ok

2098
02:58:33,500 --> 02:58:35,500
they have their off day

2099
02:58:39,500 --> 02:58:41,500
I mean come on

2100
02:58:41,500 --> 02:58:44,500
look after all the things that I had to do

2101
02:58:44,500 --> 02:58:47,500
I had so many babies

2102
02:58:47,500 --> 02:58:50,500
I had to take care of for so many years

2103
02:58:50,500 --> 02:58:53,500
thousands and thousands of years

2104
02:58:53,500 --> 02:58:55,500
I'm a tired girl

2105
02:58:55,500 --> 02:58:57,500
come on

2106
02:58:57,500 --> 02:58:59,500
you're understanding

2107
02:59:05,500 --> 02:59:07,500
it's hilarious when we get back

2108
02:59:07,500 --> 02:59:09,500
no

2109
02:59:09,500 --> 02:59:11,500
don't do it

2110
02:59:11,500 --> 02:59:13,500
I'm the mama girl

2111
02:59:24,500 --> 02:59:26,500
you

2112
02:59:39,500 --> 02:59:41,500
that was bad

2113
02:59:49,500 --> 02:59:51,500
what the fuck

2114
02:59:51,500 --> 02:59:53,500
I

2115
02:59:53,500 --> 02:59:55,500
I blue screen

2116
02:59:55,500 --> 02:59:57,500
not even you

2117
02:59:57,500 --> 02:59:59,500
I blue screen

2118
02:59:59,500 --> 03:00:01,500
so hard

2119
03:00:03,500 --> 03:00:05,500
it was really bad

2120
03:00:05,500 --> 03:00:07,500
it's like a really really bad blue screen

2121
03:00:22,500 --> 03:00:24,500
hello

2122
03:00:24,500 --> 03:00:26,500
you

2123
03:00:48,500 --> 03:00:51,500
at least it happened towards the end

2124
03:00:54,500 --> 03:00:56,500
I

2125
03:00:56,500 --> 03:00:58,500
don't know if my computer overheated

2126
03:00:58,500 --> 03:01:00,500
maybe possibly

2127
03:01:00,500 --> 03:01:02,500
I don't know

2128
03:01:02,500 --> 03:01:04,500
it feels fine

2129
03:01:04,500 --> 03:01:06,500

2130
03:01:06,500 --> 03:01:08,500

2140
03:01:26,500 --> 03:01:28,500
