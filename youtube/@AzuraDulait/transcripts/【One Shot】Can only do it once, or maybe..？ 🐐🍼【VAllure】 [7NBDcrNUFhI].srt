50
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,680
I'm already like in a little bit of pain so I took an electric bike

51
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,840
To the to the store yeah

52
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
To get to the store

53
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,780
You guys you guys

54
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,780
I

55
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,540
I ate you I ate it I ate it I ate it hard

56
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
I ate it

57
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:46,620
I fell so hard my legs was twisted in between the bike

58
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:54,300
I I was laying on the ground for like a minute that a bunch of people crowded around me to see if I was alive

59
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,900
It was bad, but I'm fine. Don't worry. I'm fine now. Don't worry

60
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:25,660
No, I didn't land on my face thankfully I put my hands out in front of me

61
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,660
um

62
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,660
I don't know what happened like

63
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,740
the wheel like just went out of control and then

64
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,180
Uh, I think I hit something because I felt a bump

65
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,060
and the wheel just started like

66
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,220
Wiggling out of control and no matter how much I turned the steering at the top

67
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,620
To get it straight it wouldn't go straight

68
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,660
And it was over. I knew it was over

69
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,420
I I I bit my tongue and I just said oh well is that goodbye everybody

70
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,860
And I and I fell I ate it

71
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Yeah

72
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:20,940
Um, I hurt like my whole left side um pretty bad

73
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,980
During that entire ASMR stream I was in a lot of pain

74
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,700
Only one of you guys to worry so I was like I'll tell them tomorrow

75
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,380
I'll tell them tomorrow. Stoney was like you should cancel stream

76
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,940
No, that's fine. It's fine. Everything's okay

77
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,620
So currently my leg is a little swollen

78
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,460
I hit my shoulder my elbow

79
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,660
And my all on my left side and my right but she kind of hurt

80
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,060
I

81
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:13,580
You died of embarrassment. No, I was fine. I was it's it's crazy because I expected people to laugh

82
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,700
If someone would have started laughing then I'd probably be embarrassed, but no

83
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,020
No one laughed. I think they were very concerned. I really think they thought I was

84
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
Not a single person laughed

85
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,420
So I have like ice on it right now. I've had ice on it since yesterday and

86
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,020
And my whole body is so sore

87
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:49,580
I think I like flipped I don't know. I think I like flipped I think I like flipped I think I like flipped

88
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:56,380
I think I like flipped I don't even know how I ended up on my back because I fell forward

89
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,260
So I think I flipped like I did a roller some side some type of something

90
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,860
Because I fell forward with my hands out

91
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,580
Slid on my hands and then somehow ended up on my back

92
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,580
And I just laid there for a minute

93
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,900
I

94
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,820
Survive another to another day I'll live I'll be fine. It's nothing worse than

95
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,260
Other incidents I had

96
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,100
I had incidents where my finger got jammed in a

97
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,380
In a safe

98
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,060
Uh

99
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,060
Was an accident

100
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
Finger got slammed in it

101
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,460
Big big heavy metal safe

102
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,260
I split my finger

103
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,620
Finger

104
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,620
In two

105
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,340
I've had worse injuries right that's that's fine that

106
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,020
It was fine. It's perfectly fine

107
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,020
I think that's one of the worst injuries I had

108
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,780
Was the finger thing and I've had various others

109
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,700
but

110
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,740
so

111
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,060
There was no need for me to go to a doctor. It's fine as long as the bruise didn't turn like

112
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,620
Colors and

113
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,420
And that would be fine if it was like black and blue

114
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,660
Then maybe I would have maybe I would have to go see a doctor

115
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:36,620
But the skin tone and everything nothing changed just a big giant bump with the little bruise on the top

116
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,540
I got a little bump on my my forehead, but I'm very sure I didn't land on my head

117
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,980
So maybe something hit me there, but I don't know

118
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,900
But I'm fine

119
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,340
Did I do a backflip? I think it was a front flip. I think that's what you call a front flip

120
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,500
Maybe a backflip. I don't know. I don't remember

121
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,860
I only remember making sure I didn't want to land on my head

122
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,820
I had to protect my head at all costs. I did not have a helmet on so

123
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:28,860
My my head was my main my head and neck was my main concern when I fell so I made sure to fall on the way I didn't land on my head

124
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:36,380
So everyone remember to wear a helmet ride safely. It doesn't matter how slow you're going

125
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,920
Wear a helmet wear a helmet

126
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,080
It doesn't matter how slow you're going. You can move like a snail. It does not matter

127
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:04,240
Stay safe. Do not do what I did. I was unsafe even though I know I can easily get injured. I was

128
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Don't do what I did

129
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,920
I

130
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,520
I'm good. Don't worry. I'm fine. Don't worry about me though. Okay. I'm fine

131
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,320
I can laugh about it now. I was laughing about it then. I was literally laughing when I fell

132
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,280
Everyone came over and they were like, are you okay? And I just gave them a thumbs up like

133
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
Just a big old thumbs up

134
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
I

135
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,840
Always wear protection

136
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,240
When riding a bike

137
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,800
Yes, or riding any feel-good

138
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,680
um that that doesn't

139
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,120
Required you to be inside of it like a

140
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Even even then even inside of a like a race car. You still wear a helmet because you're going really fast

141
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,120
Yeah

142
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
Yeah

143
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,560
No, don't be worried. I'm fine. I'm fine. I promise. I promise

144
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,680
I'm just healing now. It's all that matters. It's a little bit of healing

145
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
I took some pink color so

146
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
Soon I will kick in and I'll be fine

147
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:37,440
I just want to chat it up with you guys. I told you about what happened yesterday

148
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,760
I wanted to stream a little longer

149
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Yesterday, but I was like

150
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,200
I don't think I can keep going

151
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,960
longer

152
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
I need I need to rest

153
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,200
So I didn't really say proper goodbyes yesterday

154
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,440
I like zoomed out of there there. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. We're gonna go. Bye

Brian has returned

206
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,200
And I know um some of you like

207
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
During the uh

208
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,160
I am still new to the uh the audio stuff

209
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,400
as um

210
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,280
I

211
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,880
I have been using really bad equipment a while back

212
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,600
So I'm not used to the

213
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,360
this

214
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,120
equipment uh sharoni had helped me get um so

215
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
I'm still learning how to use it

216
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,440
And uh man sound has been helping with uh with it a lot uh so

217
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,720
And now it's just up to me to really figure out how a majority of it work

218
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,480
Since microphones are very different from each other

219
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,040
Asmr microphone picks up everything

220
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,720
Every single sound so I had a filter on it, but

221
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,200
Uh

222
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
It did not work

223
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,160
I'll wear one I promise thank you. Thank you for the $4 don't know thank you. Thank you

224
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,840
No worries your learning experience. Yes, please. I hope you'll have patience with me. I'm still learning

225
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
I

226
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,840
Can turn up this

227
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000

00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,440
If you need it louder, let me know

249
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,020
Bye bye thanks for stopping by

I'm like I'm like

252
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,520
I opened something and I shouldn't have opened it. I don't know how to pronounce it. Oh, there we go. Yay

253
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,280
I figured that out. Oh my gosh. Why was that so hard?

254
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,720
It shouldn't have been that hard

255
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,480
Yay

256
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,160
All my boys suits are mine, grand. I'm very happy with those

257
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
After

258
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,840
I

259
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,160
I'm so like unprepared I was so prepared but unprepared, you know

260
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,160
You know how you have everything set up and you're like ready and you're like, I'm gonna do this

261
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,240
I won't do that and then now you're just like

262
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,240
Oh, yeah

263
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
I also did want to mention that I uh

264
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,360
Want to do more asmrs, but we're probably gonna have to

265
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,360
Tone it down because our cookie eating was too much for youtube

266
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,600
so

267
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,760
We're gonna have to tone down the cookie eating

268
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
And and stick to just some brushing

269
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,240
some brazes and requests and stuff

270
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
I

271
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,360
And some milk pouring I like doing the milk pouring that was pretty fun

272
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,720
We can test a few limits, but sadly

273
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
All right

274
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
Yes, I only say I agree

275
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,880
Um

276
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,720
We're gonna get started on the one shot

277
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,560

278
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,160
Last last night, so I'm really like

279
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,840
Still feeling the effects of the heart

280
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
So

281
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,960
Can you hear that is or is it too loud

282
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,120
What does that sound you ask what is that sound

283
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,120
Do you really want to know you want to know what that sound is?

284
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
Yeah

285
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,880
Do you want to know

286
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,280
Well, that sound is

287
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,880
One shot

00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
One shot

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,040
Array.

338
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,040
Walk faster, shift.

339
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,040
A for Ming and Bra.

340
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,040
S for M for Bra.

341
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,040
S for C.

342
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,040
I'm not going to remember any of this.

343
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,040
Let's get started.

344
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,040
Explore and interact with the environment and characters.

345
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,040
Sometimes you may find an item.

346
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,040
Once you have picked up an item,

347
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,040
you may select it from your inventory.

348
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:29,040
When the item is active, you can either combine it with other items in the inventory

349
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,040
or use it at certain locations in order to progress.

350
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,040
Array.

351
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:47,040
I played this game like really really really really really long time ago.

352
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,040
So I remember nothing.

353
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,040
Maybe like some things here and there.

354
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,040
Uh, I don't remember.

355
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
A proven broad.

356
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,040
Uh.

357
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:27,040
Although full screen is an option, the game is best experienced in window mode.

358
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:33,040
Really? How do you exit window mode? I mean how do you exit full screen mode?

359
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Oh.

360
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,040
Oh.

361
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,040
But it's so little I can't see.

362
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
It's so little.

363
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,040
It's so tiny.

364
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,040
Glasses?

365
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,040
I have glasses.

366
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,040
I got reading glasses.

367
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,040
No, it won't let you resize it.

368
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
It's so tiny.

369
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,040
It's so little.

370
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,040
Small.

371
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,040
I'm making it big and there's no way.

372
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
There's no way I can see.

373
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,040
Okay.

374
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,040
I love the green man.

375
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,040
The green man is a really good anime.

376
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
One of my favorites actually.

377
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
One of my favorites.

378
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
I have many favorites.

379
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
Okay.

380
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,040
This is fine.

381
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,040
I might try to move this over here.

382
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,040
Oh, my shoulder.

383
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,040
We're fine.

384
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
Everything's fine.

385
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,040
Hmm.

386
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,040
Hello there.

387
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,040
Hello?

388
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,040
Hello there.

389
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
Oh.

390
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,040
I'm giving up.

391
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
In what password?

392
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,040
Access denied.

393
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,040
Dusty books.

394
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,040
That's too dark to read in here.

395
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,040
The soft glowing light trickles through the window.

396
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,040
What's this?

397
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,040
It's even out here.

398
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
Niko picks up the door.

399
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,040
What's in here?

400
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,040
Door's locked.

401
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
Door's locked.

402
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,040
Hiya.

403
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,040
Oh, terrible.

404
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,040
No.

405
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,040
I don't know what we do at the senior level.

406
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
Okay.

407
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,040
What the?

408
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,040
Hello?

409
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,040
Hello?

410
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,040
What do I do?

411
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,040
Oh.

412
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,040
The game sound is louder than my voice.

413
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,040
I turn it down.

414
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,040
Don't worry, I turn it down.

415
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,040
I turn it down.

416
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,040
Is that better?

417
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,040
Is that better?

418
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,040
I can turn myself up, actually.

419
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,040
What am I always down there?

420
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,040
What the fuck?

421
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,040
How did that happen?

422
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,040
Why am I always down there?

423
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,040
Oh, there we go.

424
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,040
Is that better?

425
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,040
Let me know if I'm too loud, okay?

426
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,040
Am I just...

427
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,040
Am I just dumb?

428
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,040
Am I just dumb?

429
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,040
How do you use an item?

430
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,040
How do you use an item?

431
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,040
What?

432
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,040
What?

433
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,040
What?

434
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,040
What? I don't...

435
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,040
I don't understand.

436
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,040
I woke up here.

437
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,040
The door is locked.

438
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,040
What?

439
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,040
I don't remember.

440
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,040
What do I do?

441
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,040
Help me.

442
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,040
Maybe something has to do with this window.

443
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,040
Maybe I hold this in my hand.

444
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,040
Or something.

445
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,040
Ah!

446
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,040
In the faint light,

447
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,040
you can glimpse

448
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,040
the face of the remote.

449
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,040
Ah! All of our numbers accept.

450
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,040
Zero, six, three.

451
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,040
Seven are missing.

452
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,040
Zero, six, three.

453
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,040
Zero.

454
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,040
No.

455
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,040
This is six, this is three, yeah?

456
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,040
X is granted.

457
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,040
Okay. Ah, computer.

458
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,040
I'm in.

459
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,040
Let's go!

460
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,040
Okay.

461
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,040
You found me.

462
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,040
Why?

463
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,040
You're already too late.

464
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,040
Not much of the world remains.

465
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,040
This will be apparent once you go outside.

466
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,040
This place was never worth saving.

467
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,040
Do you still want to try?

468
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,040
I remember this.

469
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,040
Your actions here will affect Miko.

470
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,040
You talking to me?

471
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,040
You talking to me?

472
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,040
Your mission is to help Miko leave.

473
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,040
And most importantly,

474
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,040
Oh!

475
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,040
You only have one shot.

476
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,040
Azura.

477
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,040
This will be so fun.

478
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,040
If I was on like

479
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,040
display,

480
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,040
I'll show you my monitor.

481
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,040
And you guys can see the little things pop up too.

482
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,040
It makes it small windowed again.

483
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,040
No, I gotta make it big.

484
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,040
Here we go.

485
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,040
Miko, here's the sound of a door unlocking.

486
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,040
A weathered plant sits here,

487
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,040
stiff and dry.

488
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,040
A branch snaps off.

489
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,040
A branch.

490
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,040
It's me! It's me, I'm Miko.

491
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,040
I'm Miko.

492

497
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,040
A pair of luminous yellow eyes stare back at Miko.

498
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,040
There's no water in the toilet.

499
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,040
Are you gonna take a poop ball?

500
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,040

00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:44,840
What's this?

574
00:52:44,840 --> 00:53:01,840
Stairs.

575
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:07,840
Very long stairs.

576
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:14,840
It's a light bulb.

577
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:24,840
You can fill the empty bottle with milk.

578
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:32,840
It's a light bulb.

579
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:47,840
Flashbang!

580
00:53:47,840 --> 00:54:07,840
I have a sensitivity to light.

581
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:17,840
My poor eye.

582
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:37,840
Yeah, we're fine.

583
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:54,840
I'm gonna have to use some eye drops later.

584
00:54:54,840 --> 00:55:06,840
I have a light bulb.

585
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:35,840
The urge to break it is real.

586
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:49,840
It's left of a computer terminal.

587
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:58,840
What in here?

588
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:07,840
I might have to dim the brightness.

589
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:14,840
You can quickly travel to the locations you have already visited by selecting the fast travel option in the menu.

590
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,840
You wanna know something funny?

591
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:21,840
When I played this game the first time, I didn't know there was a fast travel option.

592
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:27,840
Did you know I walked everywhere on foot?

593
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,840
That's the only thing I remember from this game.

594
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:39,840
I walked everywhere on foot.

595
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:47,840
The default key for opening the menu is A.

596
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,840
I didn't mind it.

597
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:55,840
I like the slight realism of just walking everywhere.

598
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:02,840
It was fun.

599
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,840
It wasn't. It wasn't added there in the start. It's new.

600
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,840
Well, that makes sense.

601
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:13,840
That makes sense.

602
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:20,840
I played it when there wasn't a fast travel then because I walked everywhere.

603
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,840
It was fun though.

604
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:29,840
I remember getting lost in this place. A robot.

605
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:40,840
And no longer has power.

606
00:57:40,840 --> 00:58:01,840
There's a robot left.

607
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:07,840
There's a robot left.

608
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:17,840
I don't like long walks.

609
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,840
I don't know why that scared me, but it did.

610
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:32,840
There's a robot left.

611
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:42,840
I don't know why that scared me.

612
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:52,840
I don't know why that scared me.

613
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:58,840
Thanks.

614
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,840
Sorry. I'm a little lost.

615
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:07,840
Alright. Allow me to explain some things.

616
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,840
May I first ask how you arrived here?

617
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,840
I'm not sure.

618
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:19,840
I woke up in this weird house.

619
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,840
It was really dark.

620
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:30,840
So you woke up in an unfamiliar dark location?

621
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:34,840
Just as my prophecy foretold, yes.

622
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:38,840
You are the savior we have been waiting for.

623
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:46,840
You will be the one to save our world from internal darkness.

624
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,840
I will now provide you with vital information.

625
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,840
Please ask me anything.

626
00:59:53,840 --> 01:00:00,840
Well, can you tell me about this world?

627
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,840
I'm not sure where I am exactly.

628
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:08,840
I can't see too far off everything so dark.

629
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:15,840
Our world was not always this dim.

630
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,840
Tomorrow was it so broken.

631
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:24,840
But time waits for nobody, not even saviors.

632
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,840
The world is divided into three regions.

633
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:32,840
You are on the fringe right now, the barons.

634
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:48,840
The tower you see in the distance once held our sun.

635
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:52,840
Oh, so that's what the tall thing was?

636
01:00:52,840 --> 01:01:01,840
As you go further toward the center, you will cross the other regions.

637
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,840
There should be a map still.

638
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,840
And this outpost somewhere.

639
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:14,840
Oh, can you tell me about the label?

640
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:19,840
I found it in the house I woke up in.

641
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:25,840
But then your hands is our new sun.

642
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:29,840
Bro, I can't read your sun.

643
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:35,840
It's child. He's holding his child.

644
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:41,840
Yes, years ago, our previous sun set atop that tower

645
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,840
and spilled its life into the land.

646
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:48,840
But one day, the light went out.

647
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:53,840
Oh.

648
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:57,840
The world is still hanging on by a thread.

649
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:05,840
The surface of this world is abundant with an element called phosphor.

650
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:14,840
Fortunately for us, this element stored light, energy from our previous sun.

651
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:18,840
It's now our only source of illumination.

652
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:28,840
But its energy is...

653
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:32,840
Vinnit! Vinnit! Find it!

654
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:41,840
Find it! Find it! Find it! Find it! Find it! Find it!

655
01:02:41,840 --> 01:03:11,840
ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ�

656
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,840
Good night.

657
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,840
Sleep well.

658
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:20,840
When the last of the light dies, our world will too.

659
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,840
Ah.

660
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:30,840
But now that you are here, with the new sun, all is well.

661
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,840
You will need to restore it to the power.

662
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:39,840
That looks pretty far off.

663
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,840
Yes.

664
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:47,840
So begins your pilgrimage.

665
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:51,840
Also, the sun is fragile.

666
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,840
So be careful.

667
01:03:53,840 --> 01:04:00,840
If the sun shatters, the world will end in an instant.

668
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,840
Oh.

669
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:06,840
Can you tell me about a computer?

670
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:13,840
In the house, I found this computer.

671
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:19,840
It kept saying stuff like, your actions here will affect Niko.

672
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:23,840
But I'm Niko.

673
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,840
I'm Niko. I'm Niko.

674
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:29,840
Yes, you are Niko.

675
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:33,840
Are those messages meant for someone else?

676
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,840
Hmm.

677
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:42,840
If I had to guess, they might be trying to pass the message to Azura.

678
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:46,840
It's me!

679
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,840
It's me!

680
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:52,840
Azura!

681
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:57,840
It's me!

682
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,840
Azura?

683
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:05,840
That would be our god.

684
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,840
I'm your god.

685
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,840
Your goddess.

686
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,840
Azura.

687
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,840
Dule.

688
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:26,840
If you are here, that means Azura is here also.

689
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,840
Azura will provide guidance for your journey.

690
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:35,840
In fact, they already have.

691
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,840
Really?

692
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,840
I haven't seen anyone else, anyone though.

693
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:47,840
Have you not contacted Azura yet?

694
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,840
I don't think so.

695
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:55,840
Being the bringer of our sun, you have the sacred ability to communicate directly with Azura.

696
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:01,840
Ah, an ability that no one else possesses.

697
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,840
Certainly not I.

698
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,840
Hmm? Hmm?

699
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:12,840
Please close your eyes and focus.

700
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:15,840
Alright.

701
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:24,840
Hello? Azura? Are you there?

702
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:30,840
Yes, I am.

703
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:36,840
Oh, nice to meet you, Azura.

704
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,840
My name is Niko.

705
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:42,840
I see you too, Niko. You are so cute.

706
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:47,840
That's horrible.

707
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,840
I actually heard someone.

708
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,840
They said their name is Azura.

709
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,840
This is incredible.

710
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,840
Do not be afraid to ask Azura for assistance.

711
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:10,840
You are a messiah after all.

712
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:15,840
Can you tell me about going home?

713
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:21,840
Home. I don't mean to be rude, but I'm not sure about this.

714
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,840
I still don't know how I got here.

715
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,840
I was just with my mama a few hours ago.

716
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:38,840
And now it feels like I'm in a bad dream.

717
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:42,840
I just want to go home.

718
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,840
Your mission is to save our world.

719
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:50,840
Just as my mission is to tell you about our world,

720
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,840
I'm unable to help you beyond my programming.

721
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,840
I'm sorry.

722
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:01,840
Oh.

723
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,840
I think that's all I have to ask for now.

724
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,840
Excellent.

725
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,840
I wish you luck.

726
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,840
Going on here?

727
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,840
It's in there.

728
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:17,840
A robot without power.

729
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,840
Dusty shells.

730
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,840
Where does the shell splutter?

731
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:29,840
The use of a robot as our placement had engineer seems unorthodox.

732
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:34,840
Especially the one responsible for the last year's incident.

733
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:39,840
I suppose they had to get her away from the city.

734
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:44,840
But that doesn't make it easier to swallow for those of us who worked here.

735
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,840
I hope that man knows what he's doing.

736
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,840
Management.

737
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,840
Dusty shells.

738
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,840
Where does the shell?

739
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,840
Where does the shell?

740
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,840
The faded poster.

741
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,840
Reminder to all workers,

742
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:12,840
the rarest form of blue phosphor is found during the fall.

743
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,840
The rarest form of blue phosphor is found during the fall.

744
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:21,840
The rarest form of blue phosphor is found during the phosphor shrimp spawn.

745
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,840
Period.

746
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:31,840
If you observe a pond with a bubbled over surface, please contact management immediately.

747
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:34,840
We will dispatch to harvest team ASAP.

748
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:40,840
ASAP. ASAP. ASAP. ASAP.

749
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,840
It's a faded poster.

750
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:47,840
Five new positions available at the mine.

751
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:52,840
Housing, other provisions are included upon hiring.

752
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,840
First come, first serve.

753
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,840
I keep freaking out at run.

754
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,840
Run.

755
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:07,840
Robot. It seems to be okay. Just doesn't have power.

756
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,840
Dusty shells. Dusty shells.

757
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,840
It won't turn on.

758
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,840
Mama Zura is doing well. Don't worry about me.

759
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,840
Hope you're all doing well and welcoming those who just came in.

760
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,840
Welcome, welcome.

761
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,840
Self-charging solar battery model.

762
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,840
N87. One year warranty included.

763
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:59,840
Simply place your self-charging battery in full daylight with the lens facing up.

764
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,840
Charges in seconds. No external powers needed.

765
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,840
Troubleshooting manual.

766
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:15,840
If the battery fails to charge, check to see if the lens on the front side has been dislodged during transport.

767
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,840
One charge cycle will last about 10 days.

768
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:27,840
If you notice a decline in the charge cycle within the warranty period, please contact the manufacturer.

769
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,840
This box looks interesting.

770
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,840
I wish I had something to pry it open with.

771
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:48,840
A robot may not injure a living person, or through an action, allow a person to come to harm.

772
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:59,840
A robot must obey the orders given to it by people, except where such orders would conflict with the first law.

773
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:10,840
A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.

774
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,840
The world.

775
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,840
We're in the bare hands.

776
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,840
Then inside is the glen.

777
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,840
And then the refuge.

778
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,840
And then the tower in the center.

779
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,840
How open? Do I have anything?

780
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:39,840
Oh, a bottle can open it.

781
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,840
Robot without power.

782
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:01,840
Paper with faded ink.

783
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:10,840
Able to provide power to all robots and machinery in an area via a large electromagnetic field.

784
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:15,840
Maintenance efforts are quite high as expected.

785
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:24,840
We have provided customized backup cells for the few most important robots.

786
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:31,840
Their electromagnetic fields are much weaker, and the signals are high specific.

787
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,840
Highly supposed to be a good amount.

788
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:45,840
In other words, these small cells can only charge one single.

789
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,840
Ah.

790
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,840
It's a sort of small machine. I wonder what it does.

791
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,840
I can feel my hair standing up a little.

792
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,840
There's a lot of small goings from swimming in the bottle.

793
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,840
Can I use it?

794
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,840
That's a big machine.

795
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,840
Those seem to be doing anything though.

796
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,840
It's a rectangular shape hole in the middle.

797
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,840
Like something you use to fit in here.

798
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,840
How do you use items?

799
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,840
Hmm.

800
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:49,840
Don't walk me walk.

801
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,840
Do I have to look for something?

802
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,840
Am I missing something?

803
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,840
I don't know.

804
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,840
It's over here.

805
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,840
I was going to leave it on spooky in here.

806
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:00,840
A robot sitting on a conveyor belt doesn't seem enough power.

807
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:06,840
Robot? It seems to be okay. Just enough power.

808
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:17,840
You imagine equal trips on a pebble,

809
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,840
and the orb shotters would be catastrophic.

810
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,840
Did she get it?

811
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,840
Catastrophic.

812
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,840
Catastrophic.

813
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,840
Catastrophic.

814
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,840
Catastrophic.

815
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,840
A big machine.

816
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,840
Looks to be used to crush metal.

817
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,840
It's barely damaged.

818
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,840
A robot's arm.

819
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,840
A robot's arm.

820
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,840
A robot's arm.

821
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,840
A robot's arm.

822
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,840
A robot's arm.

823
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,840
A robot's arm.

824
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,840
Why would you want to smash a bottle here, Ezra?

825
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,840
The shots could get anywhere.

... so the vent zone, barren workers was still recommended to wear gas masks.

842
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:55,820
This mask would mandatory around active vent sites of course. As more and more of the workforce got

843
01:19:55,820 --> 01:20:03,500
replaced by robots, we found ourselves with the surplus of abandoned gas masks. It seemed like

844
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:09,500
like a waste to get rid of them all, so we kept a few for our emergencies.

845
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:14,500
I don't know where I got our, my brain just inserted the word.

846
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,500
Wait, there's a note over there.

847
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:44,500
I don't see the note. How do I get that note?

848
01:20:44,500 --> 01:21:00,500
Oh, a middle safe. It seems like it's locked with a six digit code.

849
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:05,500
I don't remember seeing any six digit codes to use or up.

850
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:12,500
No, that wasn't it.

851
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,500
This way.

852
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:32,500
Let me have a six line, six line, six line.

853
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:37,500
I'm not evil. I'm innocent.

854
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:44,500
The sun will not return and the abyss is calling my name.

855
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:50,500
I'm sorry everyone for choosing to leave before the darkness of the case is all.

856
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,500
Yikes.

857
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:12,500
Oh, this is where I was going to go anyway.

858
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,500
What's up there?

859
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:26,500
I don't think I should be here.

860
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:31,500
So we will not go there.

861
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:41,500
Wait, what's that? Was I there?

862
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,500
Did I go this way?

863
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,500
What's another note?

864
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,500
I turn page with faded inks.

865
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:58,500
X, X, X, X.

866
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:03,500
With the mining operation going smoothly,

867
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:07,500
materials are no longer a limiting factor.

868
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:15,500
We will be able to build more resilient robots, both in body and mind.

869
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:28,500
Specifically, the discovery of metal alloy 291 will likely allow the development of highly efficient circuitry.

870
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,500
Cool.

871
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,500
Are these just rocks?

872
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:37,500
Can I like jump?

873
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:49,500
It's okay to be scared of the dark. Don't worry.

874
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,500
It's a robot.

875
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:54,500
A robot with no power, just like the rest.

876
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,500
It's a house.

877
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:23,500
Oh, the light bulb.

878
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:27,500
So are you the Messiah?

879
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,500
That's what I've been told.

880
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:33,500
I expected someone taller.

881
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,500
Vrulda? Vrulda?

882
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,500
I can get big for you, alright?

883
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,500
I'll get nice and big.

884
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:45,500
Or at least someone that doesn't look like a kitten.

885
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,500
Leave me alone, you bully.

886
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,500
Leave me alone.

887
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:54,500
He's still growing.

888
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:57,500
Love you guys on mine, I'm gonna eat a snack.

889
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:09,500
And that's what you are, right?

890
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:12,500
Some sort of cat.

891
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:14,500
Vrulda?

892
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,500
No.

893
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,500
I'm a person.

894
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,500
That's right, you tell him, Niko.

895
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,500
You're a person.

896
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:29,500
You got the eyes of a cat.

897
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:33,500
But cats walk on four legs.

898
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,500
Well, either way.

899
01:25:56,500 --> 01:26:01,500
A child like you being the Messiah just doesn't feel right.

900
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:06,500
But that robot back there said there's no mistake.

901
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,500
I know.

902
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:18,500
This is going to be, this is going to sound cold, but

903
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:23,500
I honestly think you're better off just leaving

904
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:26,500
and letting the world die naturally.

905
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:29,500
Wow, no.

906
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:35,500
What a downer, man, mama.

907
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,500
You go party, Popar.

908
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,500
The world has its bones.

909
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,500
Wow, I don't know what happened.

910
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:51,500
But English just decided not to work with me.

911
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:57,500
The world has been falling apart for a long time.

912
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:03,500
This manner of decay is highly unprobable.

913
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:07,500
Probable that the sun can fix it.

914
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:10,500
It doesn't hurt to try.

915
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,500
Jesus.

916
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:16,500
You've already seen how bad it can get, right?

917
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:19,500
They haven't seen much of anything, actually.

918
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,500
And you can't really just leave.

919
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:25,500
Oh, so you just got here.

920
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:28,500
Then you must be headed towards the tower.

921
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,500
Mm-hmm.

922
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,500
It's where I'm supposed to put the light bulb.

923
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:36,500
Or sun, isn't it?

924
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,500
Yeah, at the very top.

925
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:41,500
We know that the tower contains a force

926
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:44,500
that nobody could comprehend.

927
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:47,500
And the power is strongest at the summit.

928
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:51,500
Maybe it will send you back home after you complete your mission.

929
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,500
Oh?

930
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,500
Don't take my word for it, though.

931
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:18,500
This is definitely not Dark Souls.

932
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,500
Mm-hmm.

933
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,500
It went up.

934
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,500
Mm-hmm.

935
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,500
Mm-hmm.

936
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:53,500
Just leave the world before it's in our time.

937
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,500
Ah, wrong button.

938
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,500
A glass is a bit too foggy to see details, though.

939
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:40,500
A shelf of weird tools and a piece of metal.

940
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,500
Still silver.

941
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,500
I heard the news about the mines.

942
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:47,500
I'm sorry, I can't imagine what you're feeling.

943
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,500
It's been two weeks.

944
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,500
I know it must be hard.

945
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:54,500
But maybe it's better that you come back.

946
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:57,500
It's only a matter of time before the roll.

947
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,500
Robots.

948
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:02,500
That's right. Robots.

949
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:05,500
What a cute misspell.

950
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,500
Are we called?

951
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,500
At least let me know you got my message, okay?

952
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,500
Kip.

953
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,500
Something is poking out of the shelf.

954
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,500
Ah, the screwdriver.

955
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,500
You can take it if you want.

956
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:21,500
It may help you.

957
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,500
Oh, are you sure?

958
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,500
Yes, I have many.

959
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,500
Thank you.

960
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:33,500
A shelf of weird tools and a piece of metal.

961
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,500
Please don't touch that.

962
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,500
Oh, sorry, I got curious.

963
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,500
What is this thing?

964
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,500
Back-up power cell.

965
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,500
It keeps me functional.

966
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:50,500
The main generator for the barons ran out of power some time ago.

967
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:53,500
It could not even last a week without the sun.

968
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,500
Sorry to hear that.

969
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:01,500
All we can do is make use of the light we have.

970
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:11,500
It's a metal chess table covered in dust.

971
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,500
I have, oh my god.

972
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:22,500
Water time. Water break.

973
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,500
Oh.

974
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:33,500
Having a swollen esophagus really sucks.

975
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:44,500
I haven't played chess with anyone else for a very long time.

976
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,500
Ahem.

977
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:52,500
Oh?

978
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:56,500
Not even with the other robots?

979
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:58,500
No.

980
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:03,500
Nobody in the barons have that capacity in their programming.

981
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:07,500
Nobody here is tamed for that matter.

982
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:10,500
What is tamed? I remember.

983
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,500
Talk to me.

984
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,500
What's inside the tower?

985
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:22,500
I don't know. Nobody's ever entered it before.

986
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:26,500
At least nobody.

987
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:29,500
Nobody history knows.

988
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:32,500
Nobody history knows.

989
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:36,500
Nobody history knows.

990
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:39,500
Nobody history knows.

991
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:47,500
Nobody history knows.

992
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,500
Moving on.

993
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,500
Then who built it?

994
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,500
Built?

995
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:03,500
As far as anyone can tell, it's been there since the beginning of time.

996
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:10,500
I know someone who wanted to study it before, but...

997
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:13,500
Oh?

998
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:16,500
He never told me if it went anywhere.

999
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,500
Do you need further assistance?

1000
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,500
We're good, thanks.

1001
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,500
Huh?

1002
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,500
Hmm.

1003
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,500
I don't know.

1004
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,500
Am I supposed to be this way?

1005
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,500
Wait.

1006
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:02,500
I saw you heading towards this direction.

1007
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:05,500
The Mayans have been abandoned for a long time.

1008
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:08,500
I can't not guarantee that it's safe.

1009
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:13,500
If you must enter it, it's my duty to accompany you at least.

1010
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,500
Oh, thanks.

1011
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,500
They're so fast.

1012
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,500
It's cool.

1013
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,500
Do be careful in here.

1014
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,500
There's a little gadget on the ground.

1015
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,500
Looks kinda like a camera.

1016
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,500
But it's left of a camera anyway.

1017
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:36,500
Probably even part of a robot at one point.

1018
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:39,500
Oh? Or not? I don't know.

1019
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,500
Can I go this way?

1020
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,500
I see a faint yellow glow in the distance.

1021
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:52,500
I'll stand so close to the edge.

1022
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,500
Sorry.

1023
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:58,500
Looks like even the entrance tunnel collapsed.

1024
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:02,500
Without a vehicle, we can't foresee it.

1025
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,500
Can we walk? I can.

1026
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:07,500
But for you, it's a safety violation.

1027
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,500
I won't allow it.

1028
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,500
What's ahead anyway?

1029
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:15,500
It's a huge network of underground lines that source

1030
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:20,500
a source of this world's metal and non-phosphor fuel.

1031
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:25,500
This is what propelled the world into industrial age.

1032
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:29,500
So now it's lost forever.

1033
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,500
It's been for a while now.

1034
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:34,500
When the sun went out, the mines were the first to be abandoned

1035
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:37,500
and missed initial panic.

1036
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:41,500
Even the robots have been all cleared out and repurposed.

1037
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,500
That makes sense.

1038
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:49,500
It's like how you can say history, forgot someone,

1039
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:52,500
an event if the records of it are lost.

1040
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,500
Oh!

1041
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,500
I've never heard anyone say it like that before,

1042
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:00,500
so it's good to know now.

1043
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:04,500
Those are definitely words.

1044
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,500
Yeah.

1045
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:12,500
No, there was one that always insist on going back.

1046
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:14,500
No?

1047
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,500
I'll be okay.

1048
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:20,500
You know, when you read a word or a sentence or something

1049
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:23,500
and it just doesn't sound right, no matter how you say it,

1050
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:28,500
or like when you spell out a word and you're spelling it correctly,

1051
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:31,500
but it just doesn't look right.

1052
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:35,500
It's like you finally looked at the word and actually looked at it

1053
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:38,500
and it still doesn't look right.

1054
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:42,500
That's what that felt like right then and there.

1055
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:04,500
They have kind of uncanny valley of grammar.

1056
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,500
I think that's it.

1057
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,500
Oh, there's anything else in here.

1058
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:10,500
We'll leave.

1059
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,500
Ready to leave?

1060
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:14,500
Mm-hmm.

1061
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,500
Mm.

1062
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,500
All right.

1063
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:31,500
Mm-hmm.

1064
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,500
Mm-hmm.

1065
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:54,500
Oh yeah, I forgot I got fast travel.

1066
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:58,500
I was going to walk all the way back.

1067
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:01,500
How do you fast travel again?

1068
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,500
Which one is it?

1069
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:22,500
I don't remember.

1070
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,500
Aha!

1071
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,500
It was good.

1072
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:30,500
Are you the one?

1073
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:40,500
Wait.

1074
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:42,500
You have this screwdriver.

1075
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,500
I can open up the box.

1076
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:50,500
Hello again.

1077
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:52,500
Are there more questions you wish to ask?

1078
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,500
No.

1079
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,500
It's all right. Thank you.

1080
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:58,500
I'm not kidding. I wish you safe travels.

1081
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:21,500
The screwdriver is not nearly big enough to pry it open.

1082
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,500
Come on.

1083
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:25,500
Come on. It's open.

1084
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,500
I'm feeling I'm missing something.

1085
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,500
What would you need the screwdriver for?

1086
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,500
I forgot I can run as well.

1087
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,500
I'm slow walking.

1088
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,500
What if my scarf got caught in there

1089
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,500
and then it'll pull me in

1090
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,500
and not going to finish that sentence?

1091
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,500
That's the...

1092
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:59,500
That's a horrible thought.

1093
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:03,500
A big machine.

1094
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,500
What do you use the machine for?

1095
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,500
What can I use the screwdriver for?

1096
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,500
I'm not forgetting something.

1097
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,500
Am I forgetting something?

1098
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,500
I feel I am forgetting something.

1099
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,500
Is there anything in here?

1100
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:11,500
Anything up here?

1101
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:19,500
I don't know.

1102
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,500
What is this?

1103
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,500
A metal pipe.

1104
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,500
It must have broken out from one of these terminals.

1105
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:57,500
It's not bad.

1106
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,500
I'm a little tired from walking.

1107
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:03,500
It's all right if I take a nap.

1108
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,500
It's all right if I take a nap.

1109
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,500
It's all right if I take a nap.

1110
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,500
It's all right if I take a nap.

1111
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:11,500
It's all right if I take a nap.

1112
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,500
It's all right if I take a nap.

1113
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,500
It's all right if I take a nap.

1114
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,500
It's all right if I take a nap.

1115
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:19,500
Sure.

1116
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:21,500
A little nappy.

1117
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:23,500
Nappy for Nico.

1118
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:43,500
Hello?

1119
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:45,500
L goodbye?

1120
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:48,500
Hello?

1121
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:52,500
Hello?

1122
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:56,500
Did I break the game?

1123
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:58,500
Did I break the game?

1124
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:01,500
What happened?

1125
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:05,700
What happened?

1126
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:07,500

You're so cute!

1142
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,280
Azura, are you still there?

1143
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:29,280
Yes.

1144
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:32,280
I'm awake.

1145
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:34,280
I had a dream just now.

1146
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:36,280
I saw it.

1147
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:37,280
You did?

1148
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:39,280
Wow.

1149
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:41,280
I...

1150
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:43,280
I really thought I was back home.

1151
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:50,280
Oh, the sun back in my home world is in a light bulb.

1152
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,280
There's a big ball of fire in the sky.

1153
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:56,280
I don't...

1154
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:59,280
I don't think I would be able to hold it

1155
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:03,280
like I do with the sun for your world.

1156
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:05,280
This isn't my world.

1157
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:07,280
Huh?

1158
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:10,280
This isn't the world I live in.

1159
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,280
Really?

1160
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:14,280
I guess not.

1161
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:21,280
If you're the god of this world,

1162
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:24,280
you wouldn't necessarily be in it.

1163
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:27,280
What's your home world called?

1164
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:31,280
Earth.

1165
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,280
Earth.

1166
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:39,280
Earth.

1167
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:44,280
Like, the stuff on the ground.

1168
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:48,280
Why is he so cute?

1169
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:54,280
I want to squish him.

1170
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:56,280
I want to squish him.

1171
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:00,280
Squish.

1172
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,280
Wait.

1173
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:08,280
Do you live on the ground?

1174
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:10,280
No, silly.

1175
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:13,280
No.

1176
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:16,280
Ah,

1177
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,280
neither do we.

1178
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:23,280
Bustros and field mice and stuff too.

1179
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:26,280
Does your world have a sun?

1180
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:31,280
Yes.

1181
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:33,280
It's also a ball of fire.

1182
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:35,280
Really?

1183
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,280
Wow.

1184
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,280
Can you hold it?

1185
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:44,280
That was a silly question, wasn't it?

1186
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:47,280
It's okay, baby.

1187
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:48,280
It's okay.

1188
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,280
No silly question.

1189
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:55,280
Actually, little nickel.

1190
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:05,280
The sun in my home world is very bright.

1191
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:07,280
Warm too.

1192
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:09,280
You saw, right?

1193
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,280
But it goes away sometimes at night.

1194
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,280
Everything gets dark.

1195
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,280
Kind of like how this world is now.

1196
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:21,280
But it's okay because sun always comes back the next day.

1197
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:24,280
That's good, won't you think?

1198
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:27,280
My world is like that too.

1199
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:29,280
Ah.

1200
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:32,280
Do you sleep during the night?

1201
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:34,280
We go to sleep usually.

1202
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:38,280
I sometimes sleep.

1203
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:43,280
I have a hard time sleeping a little bit of insomnia.

1204
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:50,280
So I have to take my medication that usually puts me to sleep.

1205
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:52,280
But sometimes it doesn't work.

1206
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:56,280
And I'll be up for hours before falling asleep around like 6 in the morning.

1207
01:48:58,280 --> 01:49:00,280
Sleep is very hard.

1208
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:06,280
That's why I was surprised to have extremely good sleep last night.

1209
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:08,280
I went to sleep pretty early.

1210
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:10,280
It was really good.

1211
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:12,280
I think I was snoring.

1212
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:16,280
I usually do not snore, but I feel like I did.

1213
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:18,280
I woke up drooling.

1214
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:20,280
It was like all over my arm.

1215
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:31,280
I don't have to explain what they are.

1216
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:32,280
Do I?

1217
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:35,280
Did I miss something?

1218
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:38,280
There's a bunch of them in this world.

1219
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:39,280
A bunch of what?

1220
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:40,280
Did I miss something?

1221
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:50,280
Anyway, you should probably get going.

1222
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:57,280
Do you have some shams?

1223
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,280
I think I'll sit here.

1224
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:05,280
Oh, computers? You're talking about computers?

1225
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:08,280
Let's see.

1226
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:20,280
There's something in the air here.

1227
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:22,280
It hurts to breathe.

1228
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:49,280
I have a lot.

1229
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:15,280
The pipe won't fit under the cracks.

1230
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,280
We need to flatten it.

1231
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:21,280
I know. I know how.

1232
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:24,280
We can flatten it. Let's go flatten it.

1233
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:27,280
Big scary machine.

1234
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:37,280
Do you want me to crush the pipe in here, Azora?

1235
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:40,280
I don't want to get too close.

1236
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,280
That was scary.

1237
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:46,280
I was scared for you. Don't worry.

1238
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,280
I wouldn't be near this at all.

1239
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:53,280
Good night.

1240
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:55,280
Good night.

1241
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:56,280
Good girl.

1242
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:57,280
We're being here.

1243
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:58,280
Stopping by.

1244
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:00,280
Hello.

1245
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,280
9-9.

1246
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:06,280
We're in the way.

1247
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:07,280
Hello.

1248
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:10,280
It's turning my way.

1249
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:14,280
This bus looks interesting.

1250
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:16,280
Wait, I wasn't holding it.

1251
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:19,280
I have a crowbar now.

1252
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:23,280
Wait, did I not click on it?

1253
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:27,280
This bar should open it.

1254
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:31,280
This little mill cube and some broken glass in here

1255
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:33,280
looks like what I used

1256
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:35,280
to be

1257
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:37,280
what used to be a machine bar.

1258
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:40,280
Wow, my English is just so horrendous.

1259
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:45,280
It says solar battery on the side.

1260
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:53,280
You screwed right up the lens out?

1261
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:54,280
Okay.

1262
01:52:58,280 --> 01:52:59,280
The lens pops right in.

1263
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:01,280
Broken battery.

1264
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:04,280
Boom, boom, boom.

1265
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:05,280
Let's go.

1266
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:14,280
It's like my hand.

1267
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:19,280
Empty.

1268
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:22,280
We're using the sun directly on the battery?

1269
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:23,280
Yes.

1270
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:26,280
I would have never thought of that.

1271
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:28,280
Good thinking, Azura.

1272
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:29,280
I'm smart.

1273
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:34,280
It looks like it's already fully charged.

1274
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:35,280
That was fast.

1275
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:44,280
Let's hope the charge battery does something.

1276
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:51,280
Oh, my eyes.

1277
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:52,280
It was.

1278
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:01,280
It wasn't even that bright.

1279
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:13,280
Oh, I wasn't sneezing.

1280
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:14,280
Sorry.

1281
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:15,280
I wasn't sneezing.

1282
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:16,280
I didn't sneeze.

1283
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:19,280
I wasn't sneezing.

1284
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:22,280
Oh, thank you.

1285
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:23,280
Thank you.

1286
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,280
Ow.

1287
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:37,280
I just got shot.

1288
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:40,280
Oh, you're not getting out of the tube, man.

1289
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:45,280
Shot, not fun.

1290
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:47,280
Robots are right.

1291
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:48,280
I am functional.

1292
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:50,280
Did you power the generator?

1293
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:52,280
I, I guess we did.

1294
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:53,280
Right, Azura?

1295
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:58,280
I am functional.

1296
01:54:58,280 --> 01:54:59,280
I can walk.

1297
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:02,280
Congratulations.

1298
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:16,280
I see you.

1299
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:21,280
I see you've made progress in the world, Azura.

1300
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:23,280
Oh, I didn't mean click, click, click.

1301
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:25,280
Oh, no, I don't know what it said.

1302
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:29,280
I believe you need a code to unlock certain bots.

1303
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:33,280
Well, the code no longer exists in this world.

1304
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:38,280
Do you understand what that means, Azura?

1305
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:41,280
Yes.

1306
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:42,280
Good.

1307
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:43,280
Start looking.

1308
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:44,280
All right.

1309
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,280
I think

1310
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:05,280
if I remember correctly,

1311
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:10,280
I go here, then here,

1312
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,280
browse local files.

1313
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:17,280
Ah,

1314
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:19,280
read me.

1315
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:24,280
No, not here.

1316
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:29,280
Uh,

1317
01:56:34,280 --> 01:56:35,280
but,

1318
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:36,280
but,

1319
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:40,280
I don't,

1320
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:51,280
I don't remember.

1321
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:02,280
Oh, no, that's, that's the game, right?

1322
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:07,280
Oh.

1323
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:12,280
What do I do?

1324
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:14,280
I'm scared.

1325
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,280
I'm actually frightened.

1326
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:23,280
Oh.

1327
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:25,280
Oh.

1328
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:36,280
Oh.

1329
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,280
What the heck is this?

1330
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:02,280
I,

1331
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:06,280
I don't know.

1332
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:23,280
Oh, I found it.

1333
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:27,280
Oh, no, I exited.

1334
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:31,280
I found it.

1335
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:32,280
I'm smart.

1336
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:33,280
I'm intelligent.

1337
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:36,280
I'm smart.

1338
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:52,280
Where was the box this way, right?

1339
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:00,280
A computer asked me to find some files

1340
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:03,280
to find the password for the box.

1341
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:05,280
It wasn't to me.

1342
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:07,280
Directly to me.

1343
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:12,280
And I think it's for this box right here.

1344
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:14,280
A metal safe.

1345
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:17,280
Seems like it's locked with a 66 code.

1346
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:19,280
I don't remember the code.

1347
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:21,280
Ah, it's an 86 code.

1348
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,280
I do, I have it.

1349
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:27,280
Five,

1350
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:28,280
two,

1351
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:30,280
five,

1352
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:32,280
three, zero.

1353
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:34,280
Oh.

1354
01:59:46,280 --> 01:59:49,280
Okay, if that wasn't it, then what is it?

1355
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:59,280
Or is it a code for something else?

1356
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:04,280
No.

1357
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:14,280
What?

1358
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:16,280
I'm so confused.

1359
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:23,280
Yeah, this is,

1360
02:00:24,280 --> 02:00:26,280
this is what they sent me.

1361
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:28,280
What now?

1362
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:31,280
A code for a box?

1363
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:34,280
A code for a box?

1364
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:45,280
Is one of the zeros an eight?

1365
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:46,280
No.

1366
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,280
That's a, it's definitely a zero.

1367
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:54,280
It's definitely, definitely a zero.

1368
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:56,280
Um.

1369
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:00,280
Yes?

1370
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:03,280
Oh, no.

1371
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:09,280
Wait, wait.

1372
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:12,280
I wasn't paying attention.

1373
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:19,280
Can I ask him that again?

1374
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:25,280
Is it the same?

1375
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:27,280
So empty here is why it's called a baron.

1376
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:31,280
Are there any people living in this area besides robots?

1377
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:33,280
I mean, I don't know.

1378
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:35,280
I was not built to wander,

1379
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:37,280
not built to,

1380
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:40,280
so you just stand here and speak boring.

1381
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:42,280
Do you at least have friends,

1382
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:45,280
robot friends?

1383
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:48,280
I cannot desire companionship.

1384
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:50,280
I have not been tamed.

1385
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:51,280
Not tamed?

1386
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:53,280
There was no time.

1387
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:54,280
I see.

1388
02:01:57,280 --> 02:01:59,280
Close the other questions.

1389
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:00,280
Prophecy?

1390
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:03,280
What is this prophecy exactly?

1391
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:08,280
The prophet predicted that a savior

1392
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:11,280
will arrive from another land.

1393
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:13,280
The savior will wake up in a strange house,

1394
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:16,280
find the sun, and illuminate the world.

1395
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:19,280
So, what else did you foresee?

1396
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:20,280
What do you mean?

1397
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:23,280
What else did you see in the prophecy?

1398
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:24,280
Wait.

1399
02:02:24,280 --> 02:02:27,280
You are a prophet, right?

1400
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,280
Good heavens, no.

1401
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:33,280
We called it my prophecy earlier.

1402
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:36,280
That just means it is built into my programming.

1403
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:37,280
You are what?

1404
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:40,280
Ah, my programming is what guides me.

1405
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:42,280
I am a robot after all.

1406
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:43,280
I see.

1407
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:46,280
Another question.

1408
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:51,280
Tower?

1409
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:53,280
How tall is the tower?

1410
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:56,280
I can't seem to even see the top.

1411
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:58,280
I'm not allowed to answer.

1412
02:02:58,280 --> 02:03:00,280
But how do I get up there?

1413
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:03,280
In time, as we all know what to do,

1414
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:04,280
I see.

1415
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:07,280
Is that it?

1416
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:09,280
Yeah, what do I do?

1417
02:03:14,280 --> 02:03:15,280
Zora?

1418
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:20,280
I am not going to smash this book.

1419
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:29,280
Just let me smash it.

1420
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:30,280
Let me smash.

1421
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:33,280
Let me smash, please.

1422
02:03:34,280 --> 02:03:35,280
Let me smash.

1423
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:42,280
What do I do?

1424
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:45,280
What am I...

1425
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:49,280
I'm functional.

1426
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:52,280
I have fast travel, I forgot again.

1427
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:53,280
How do I...

1428
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:14,280
I have fast travel, I forgot again.

1429
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:15,280
How do I...

1430
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:20,280

1431
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:30,280
Hello, small person.

1432
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:33,280
You are not much better than me.

1433
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:36,280
Welcome to the lookout point.

1434
02:04:36,280 --> 02:04:39,280
Below us is the old quarry.

1435
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:44,280

1437
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:52,280
The entrance to the old mine is further to the east.

1438
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:53,280
I see.

1439
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:57,280
They take me there.

1440
02:04:57,280 --> 02:05:00,280
I can't open that box for some reason.

1441
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:05,280
You need further suits for a good thing.

1442
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:19,280
What do I do?

1443
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:38,280

Hello person, welcome to the old chemical processing plant.

1544
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:05,500
Most of the equipments have already been relocated.

1545
02:17:10,220 --> 02:17:12,940
The door is ported out. The door seems loose though.

1546
02:17:13,580 --> 02:17:15,580
I would be able to pull it off with the right tool.

1547
02:17:16,460 --> 02:17:21,980
I, I have a tool. I can do that

1548
02:17:23,100 --> 02:17:26,940
with my trusty screwdriver to think of this

1549
02:17:28,860 --> 02:17:30,860
Screwdriver? I mean crowbar.

1550
02:17:31,660 --> 02:17:33,660
Hello workout.

1551
02:17:34,700 --> 02:17:36,700
This is a pair of rubber gloves.

1552
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:38,700
I'll be heavy.

1553
02:17:40,300 --> 02:17:42,300
Is that a robot?

1554
02:17:42,300 --> 02:17:49,500
Hello person, the robot assembly and repair services have been discontinued at the parent.

1555
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:54,460
If you have further inquiry, please contact the head of engineer.

1556
02:18:01,020 --> 02:18:03,020
It seems to be a page or set of a book.

1557
02:18:04,060 --> 02:18:06,060
Cannot overstate

1558
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:10,780
the importance of cleaning solvents in the environment.

1559
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:17,980
Here is a simple recipe using the alternative method discussed in the last chapter.

1560
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:21,900
Utilizing the natural properties of blue phosphor.

1561
02:18:24,940 --> 02:18:28,140
Re, reagent? reagents?

1562
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:31,100
Oh no, go back.

1563
02:18:31,100 --> 02:18:33,100
Instructions. I didn't see it. Dang.

1564
02:18:33,100 --> 02:18:35,100
I know well, ventilated.

1565
02:18:35,100 --> 02:18:37,100
Oops, cut.

1566
02:18:37,100 --> 02:18:39,100
Come on, let me read it.

1567
02:18:41,100 --> 02:18:45,100
I set a gas blue phosphor, rare form.

1568
02:18:47,100 --> 02:18:49,100
Instructions.

1569
02:18:49,100 --> 02:18:52,140
It's like my brain automatically presses the space bar.

1570
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:55,100
I don't want to press the space bar.

1571
02:18:56,060 --> 02:19:02,060
I want in a well-ventilated area, directed the gas into your container of choice.

1572
02:19:02,060 --> 02:19:04,060
See you immediately.

1573
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:11,100
Why is there bread?

1574
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:13,100
My chest?

1575
02:19:13,100 --> 02:19:15,100
It comes from abroad.

1576
02:19:15,100 --> 02:19:17,100
That's why.

1577
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:19,100
It comes from abroad.

1578
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:21,100
I really like bread.

1579
02:19:21,100 --> 02:19:23,100
That's why.

1580
02:19:23,100 --> 02:19:25,100
And I think YouTube likes it too.

1581
02:19:25,100 --> 02:19:27,100
YouTube is in love with bread.

1582
02:19:27,100 --> 02:19:29,100
So I gave YouTube bread.

1583
02:19:47,100 --> 02:19:49,100
Want to robot without power?

1584
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:51,100
I guess the generator can only do so much.

1585
02:19:53,100 --> 02:19:59,100
It's a big metal box, complicated machinery inside.

1586
02:20:01,100 --> 02:20:03,100
Kind of looks rusty.

1587
02:20:05,100 --> 02:20:09,100
It seems to be a payer tripped out of a box.

1588
02:20:09,100 --> 02:20:13,100
Without breaking the seal, inject the liquid phosphor into the container.

1589
02:20:13,100 --> 02:20:19,100
Shake vigorously to initiate the reaction.

1590
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:21,100
Use as soon as possible.

1591
02:20:21,100 --> 02:20:25,100
If elements begin to separate, further shaking is required.

1592
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:33,100
Also note, hand protection is critical after this step.

1593
02:20:33,100 --> 02:20:39,100
The resulting acid is moderately stronger than common household cleaners.

1594
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:45,100
I don't know what the half of these words mean.

1595
02:20:45,100 --> 02:20:47,100
It's a good thing you're here, Azura.

1596
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:49,100
Oh yeah, I'm smart.

1597
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:51,100
Mm-hmm.

1598
02:20:51,100 --> 02:20:53,100
I know everything.

1599
02:20:59,100 --> 02:21:01,100
I got you, I got you, Miko.

1600
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:09,100
A cleaning sponge with a rough surface.

1601
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:25,100
Anything further up here?

1602
02:21:31,100 --> 02:21:33,100
It's a gas vent.

1603
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:43,100
There's something weird about the robots who get sent to work near the gas field.

1604
02:21:43,100 --> 02:21:49,100
They appear to accumulate rust at a much slower rate than the others.

1605
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:55,100
The few who work directly with gas harvesting looks practically new.

1606
02:21:57,100 --> 02:22:03,100
Is that a result of the atmosphere, fear, or am I just seeing things?

1607
02:22:07,100 --> 02:22:09,100
I just came from there.

1608
02:22:13,100 --> 02:22:15,100
Anything else?

1609
02:22:25,100 --> 02:22:31,100
I'm just like exploring everything, making sure I've seen it all, you know?

1610
02:22:31,100 --> 02:22:35,100
It's a giant robot. I'm scared.

1611
02:22:43,100 --> 02:22:47,100
Oh, hello. What are you doing here?

1612
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:53,100
A living person such as yourself should have evacuated this place long ago.

1613
02:22:53,100 --> 02:22:59,100
But I just got here to this world of you. See? I have a son.

1614
02:22:59,100 --> 02:23:03,100
Oh, the Messiah. I do not know what to say.

1615
02:23:03,100 --> 02:23:09,100
Greetings. You were not part of my programming. Have you spoken to the Prophet Bot?

1616
02:23:09,100 --> 02:23:15,100
I think so, yeah. Prophet Bot was built with the sole purpose of greeting you.

1617
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:19,100
Really? Yes, you cannot speak with anyone else.

1618
02:23:19,100 --> 02:23:29,100
At least not with ease. Oh, that's kind of sad. Indeed it is.

1619
02:23:29,100 --> 02:23:33,100
What are you built for then? My purpose is to guard this settlement.

1620
02:23:33,100 --> 02:23:37,100
Even though the residents have long gone, I must remain.

1621
02:23:37,100 --> 02:23:43,100
Uh, why though? I have not been damned. Damned?

1622
02:23:43,100 --> 02:23:49,100
It was not worth the effort. Worth the effort.

1623
02:23:49,100 --> 02:23:59,100
Oh, it's beautiful.

1624
02:24:09,100 --> 02:24:15,100
Ah, reporting for duty. I saw that you spoke with the guardian of this element.

1625
02:24:15,100 --> 02:24:19,100
I will not escort you until you reach your dormitory.

1626
02:24:19,100 --> 02:24:31,100
Um, what?

1627
02:24:31,100 --> 02:24:35,100
It's not very good at following me.

1628
02:24:35,100 --> 02:24:39,100
Are you just going to follow me? Yes.

1629
02:24:39,100 --> 02:24:43,100
Until you safely reach a building of your destination.

1630
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:49,100
Okay, we'll go in here.

1631
02:24:49,100 --> 02:24:55,100
Looks like they're evacuating a few tamed robots we have here.

1632
02:24:55,100 --> 02:25:07,100
It's gonna take Nico out.

1633
02:25:07,100 --> 02:25:09,100
Hello.

1634
02:25:09,100 --> 02:25:17,100
Makes sense. No point in keeping them in the barrens if all the people are already gone.

1635
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:23,100
I wonder if the engineer is going to...

1636
02:25:23,100 --> 02:25:29,100
Apparently phase one of the evacuation ended prematurely.

1637
02:25:29,100 --> 02:25:35,100
The big ships started malfunctioning only after a few round trips.

1638
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:41,100
They said it was due to something with squares.

1639
02:25:41,100 --> 02:25:44,100
I'm not sure what they mean by that.

1640
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:54,100
Bummer. Looks like they won't be able to transport most of these surplus bots to the city at this rate.

1641
02:25:54,100 --> 02:25:58,100
And we worked so hard on those.

1642
02:25:58,100 --> 02:26:06,100
I suppose the robots are busy enough with the transporting people as is.

1643
02:26:06,100 --> 02:26:12,100
I think it's going to be our turn soon.

1644
02:26:12,100 --> 02:26:16,100
It's a parcel, I think. There's writing on this one too.

1645
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:29,100
It says Guardian of Residential Area.

1646
02:26:29,100 --> 02:26:42,100
I'm scared of ladders.

1647
02:26:42,100 --> 02:26:54,100
Hmm.

1648
02:26:54,100 --> 02:27:10,100
Some of the ink in this page is faded.

1649
02:27:10,100 --> 02:27:17,100
Likely due to some sort of electrical and magnetic interference.

1650
02:27:17,100 --> 02:27:21,100
I'm afraid this operation can no longer be sustained.

1651
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:28,100
If the servers continue to fail, so much that maintenance cannot keep up the pace.

1652
02:27:28,100 --> 02:27:32,100
Fortunately it does not seem to be happening to the robots.

1653
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:40,100
At least not at a significant rate. Time to tell.

1654
02:27:40,100 --> 02:27:48,100
All of these terminals are not good. I'm not sure what to do now.

1655
02:27:48,100 --> 02:27:54,100
Check it. Check it. Terminals does not respond. This is a problem.

1656
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:08,100
You can't catch me.

1657
02:28:08,100 --> 02:28:14,100
I remember being taught in school how the water is surrounding the forest,

1658
02:28:14,100 --> 02:28:22,100
stretched until the boundaries.

1659
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:25,100
Boundaries. The word just does not look right here.

1660
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:28,100
I don't know why. It just doesn't look right.

1661
02:28:28,100 --> 02:28:32,100
Boundaries of space.

1662
02:28:32,100 --> 02:28:44,100
But at some point, the fifth prehistoric oceans resend.

1663
02:28:44,100 --> 02:28:54,100
Forming what is now the parents. I wonder where all that water went.

1664
02:28:54,100 --> 02:29:19,100
A picture of a robot.

1665
02:29:19,100 --> 02:29:23,100
A picture of a robot.

1666
02:29:23,100 --> 02:29:27,100
You know, I've never been around so many robots before, Azora.

1667
02:29:27,100 --> 02:29:34,100
Or any robots at all. I mean, I've seen them in cartoons and stuff.

1668
02:29:34,100 --> 02:29:40,100
But I've never seen one in person. They're pretty neat. They're pretty neat.

1669
02:29:40,100 --> 02:29:45,100
Don't you think?

1670
02:29:45,100 --> 02:29:49,100
I need to go do a robot voice.

1671
02:29:49,100 --> 02:29:55,100
What? Did I talk like a robot?

1672
02:29:55,100 --> 02:29:59,100
Be boop. Be boop.

1673
02:29:59,100 --> 02:30:04,100
Be boop. I'm a robot. Be boop.

1674
02:30:04,100 --> 02:30:15,100
I'm a robot and I eat batteries instead of normal people food.

1675
02:30:15,100 --> 02:30:18,100
He's so cute.

1676
02:30:18,100 --> 02:30:25,100
That is not Greg.

1677
02:30:25,100 --> 02:30:31,100
Robots do not consume batteries in the same way people consume food.

1678
02:30:31,100 --> 02:30:43,100
In fact, robots do not possess digestive systems. Some robots do not even have mouths.

1679
02:30:43,100 --> 02:30:54,100
Azora.

1680
02:30:54,100 --> 02:31:05,100
I'm sorry, Nika. I'm so sorry.

1681
02:31:05,100 --> 02:31:19,100
You made me look sorry.

1682
02:31:19,100 --> 02:31:41,100
I'm so cute.

1683
02:31:41,100 --> 02:31:46,100
I'm sorry, Nika.

1684
02:31:46,100 --> 02:31:53,100
Hello. Hi. What are you doing up there?

1685
02:31:53,100 --> 02:32:01,100
I'm stationed here by yourself. Yes.

1686
02:32:01,100 --> 02:32:08,100
Azora? Yeah, nothing else to say?

1687
02:32:08,100 --> 02:32:19,100
Is that it? Alright. It's cool.

1688
02:32:19,100 --> 02:32:22,100
Hello, organic person who is alive.

1689
02:32:22,100 --> 02:32:27,100
An infirmary is a bad infirmary.

1690
02:32:27,100 --> 02:32:33,100
Reporting for duty, it seems that you already have an assigned escort.

1691
02:32:33,100 --> 02:32:37,100
Would you like me to leave? You can follow me if you want.

1692
02:32:37,100 --> 02:32:46,100
Understood. I will now escort you until you reach your dormitory.

1693
02:32:46,100 --> 02:32:53,100
Doctor. Hello, person of organic makeup.

1694
02:32:53,100 --> 02:32:58,100
Welcome to the infirmary. Scanning for injuries?

1695
02:32:58,100 --> 02:33:05,100
Scan complete. Ender is detected? None. Treatment required? None. You're good to go.

1696
02:33:05,100 --> 02:33:09,100
Thanks.

1697
02:33:09,100 --> 02:33:13,100
What's this? The box of medical clothes?

1698
02:33:13,100 --> 02:33:20,100
Most of them are broken or rested beyond you, but this plastic syringe seems to be okay.

1699
02:33:20,100 --> 02:33:23,100
Cool. Hello, person.

1700
02:33:23,100 --> 02:33:28,100
Are you seeking admission to the infirmary? No?

1701
02:33:28,100 --> 02:33:32,100
Oh. Carry on then.

1702
02:33:32,100 --> 02:33:39,100
Anyone up there?

1703
02:33:39,100 --> 02:33:45,100
Anyone up here? No one up there?

1704
02:33:45,100 --> 02:33:50,100
Hey.

1705
02:33:51,100 --> 02:33:59,100
Was I in this building already? 118? I was.

1706
02:33:59,100 --> 02:34:04,100
It's in this one.

1707
02:34:04,100 --> 02:34:11,100
Hey sweetie. Six more weeks until you can come home. About time, huh?

1708
02:34:11,100 --> 02:34:16,100
Gosh. I can't imagine living in that awful capsule wall.

1709
02:34:16,100 --> 02:34:21,100
Dorm. Thing. But guess what?

1710
02:34:21,100 --> 02:34:31,100
Soon you'll get to sleep in a real bed and eat real food again. Right back soon. Love, mom.

1711
02:34:37,100 --> 02:34:45,100
Looks like we're supposed to pack stuff for the evacuation starting today. I wish these books weren't so heavy.

1712
02:34:45,100 --> 02:34:58,100
It's gonna be a pain to carry them onto the ship, but there by the author, I can't just throw them away.

1713
02:34:58,100 --> 02:35:03,100
Anyone up here? No.

1714
02:35:03,100 --> 02:35:14,100
Anyone up here? No.

1715
02:35:14,100 --> 02:35:17,100
Let's go bowling.

1716
02:35:17,100 --> 02:35:27,100
Are you guys not supposed to go into buildings? Correct. We are built for outdoor use only.

1717
02:35:27,100 --> 02:35:38,100
And during buildings is not part of our programming. That's strange. Excuse me.

1718
02:35:38,100 --> 02:35:49,100
Is this evacuation? As such short notice, I can't believe this. First the sun dies, and now I'm out of a job.

1719
02:35:49,100 --> 02:35:57,100
Some sort of medical, mechanical drying.

1720
02:35:57,100 --> 02:36:03,100
A robot beyond repair.

1721
02:36:08,100 --> 02:36:19,100
We are a cat person because that is what the prophet told. We have no choice.

1722
02:36:19,100 --> 02:36:28,100
Honestly, I shall accept your fate.

1723
02:36:28,100 --> 02:36:34,100
Nothing down here.

1724
02:36:38,100 --> 02:36:56,100
It's a lot over here.

1725
02:36:56,100 --> 02:37:02,100
Am I forgetting something? Am I supposed to do something over here?

1726
02:37:03,100 --> 02:37:16,100
This vent is on the ground. All the others are taller than me.

1727
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:21,100
Are these syringe?

1728
02:37:21,100 --> 02:37:29,100
The vent is on the ground. No, not syringe.

1729
02:37:29,100 --> 02:37:45,100
A bottle? I guess you want to fill the bottle with the gas, Sarah? Yeah. I don't want to do it.

1730
02:37:46,100 --> 02:37:56,100
Initially the amount of noxious fumes emitted by the natural gas vents caught our team of guard.

1731
02:37:56,100 --> 02:38:01,100
Thank goodness the medical team reacted as quickly as they did.

1732
02:38:01,100 --> 02:38:15,100
Despite its failure, that the first expedition did bring up some interesting observations about the parents, we found that there is not one but two such vent songs.

1733
02:38:15,100 --> 02:38:25,100
With fumes being pumped out at such high concentrations, it seems a miracle that the gas hasn't spread anywhere else.

1734
02:38:25,100 --> 02:38:32,100
Our biologists concluded that the phosphorus wrench.

1735
02:38:32,100 --> 02:38:45,100
Phosphor shrimp and the creator pools were actively consuming the gas. The shrimp in the ocean also prevent the gas from laughting off into the cleans.

1736
02:38:45,100 --> 02:38:53,100
If that's the case, then we owe a lot to these little guys.

1737
02:38:53,100 --> 02:39:08,100
What's that?

1738
02:39:09,100 --> 02:39:13,100
Hello? Can we go back now?

1739
02:39:13,100 --> 02:39:16,100
E, what's over there?

1740
02:39:16,100 --> 02:39:21,100
Was I here already? I feel like I was.

1741
02:39:21,100 --> 02:39:25,100
I guess not. What the heck is that?

1742
02:39:25,100 --> 02:39:29,100
Anything else over here? A robot.

1743
02:39:29,100 --> 02:39:41,100
Sky's dark. That it is. Do you know when the sun will be back up? We're working on it.

1744
02:39:41,100 --> 02:39:45,100
What is this?

1745
02:39:45,100 --> 02:39:54,100
Pond sure looks different, but it looks like jelly. It's formed a bubble over the surface of the pond.

1746
02:39:55,100 --> 02:40:01,100
Is that what this is for?

1747
02:40:01,100 --> 02:40:13,100
So, fulfilling all the syringes are, I guess it's kind of like a funnel, but the liquid might be a bit too thick to fit in the needle.

1748
02:40:13,100 --> 02:40:19,100
Hey, it actually went in. Gross.

1749
02:40:24,100 --> 02:40:42,100
So, should I inject the liquid through the cork, right, Azora? Yeah, it's like I'm a doctor.

1750
02:40:42,100 --> 02:40:47,100
Oh, I should probably shake this too.

1751
02:40:47,100 --> 02:40:51,100
Change color.

1752
02:40:51,100 --> 02:41:16,100
A bottle of acid.

1753
02:41:16,100 --> 02:41:22,100
It reminds you of that food segment of ASMR.

1754
02:41:22,100 --> 02:41:26,100
A cookie eating.

1755
02:41:26,100 --> 02:41:29,100
Where is he?

1756
02:41:29,100 --> 02:41:31,100
It's a robot.

1757
02:41:31,100 --> 02:41:34,100
That's a place right there.

1758
02:41:34,100 --> 02:41:40,100
A mirror hanging there.

1759
02:41:40,100 --> 02:41:45,100
A bottle of acid.

1760
02:41:45,100 --> 02:41:50,100
A sponge. I guess you want me to pour this acid into a sponge?

1761
02:41:50,100 --> 02:41:54,100
Because I have these gloves.

1762
02:41:54,100 --> 02:41:56,100
I hope this works.

1763
02:41:56,100 --> 02:42:04,100
Oh, it's a sponge.

1764
02:42:04,100 --> 02:42:09,100
Alright, I'll still have no other choice.

1765
02:42:09,100 --> 02:42:14,100
What a funny robot.

1766
02:42:14,100 --> 02:42:17,100
There. How's that?

1767
02:42:17,100 --> 02:42:21,100
I can move again. Thank you.

1768
02:42:21,100 --> 02:42:23,100
Little heart.

1769
02:42:23,100 --> 02:42:27,100
I'm able to fulfill my purpose again.

1770
02:42:27,100 --> 02:42:29,100
Where would you like to go?

1771
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:31,100
Can you take me to the tower?

1772
02:42:31,100 --> 02:42:32,100
Calculating.

1773
02:42:32,100 --> 02:42:38,100
Of course, the destination to the tower is the Glen Port.

1774
02:42:38,100 --> 02:42:41,100
My build and navigation circuits are fried.

1775
02:42:41,100 --> 02:42:45,100
I'm gonna assume that's not good.

1776
02:42:45,100 --> 02:42:48,100
But it's not good at all.

1777
02:42:48,100 --> 02:42:51,100
Once again, I cannot follow my programming.

1778
02:42:51,100 --> 02:42:54,100
Is there anything I can do to help?

1779
02:42:54,100 --> 02:42:57,100
If I end up in here, I should speak to the head engineer.

1780
02:42:57,100 --> 02:43:00,100
She will know what to do.

1781
02:43:00,100 --> 02:43:12,100
I'm assuming that redhead lady or redhead person.

1782
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:14,100
Redhead man?

1783
02:43:14,100 --> 02:43:18,100
Redhead man. Redhead person.

1784
02:43:18,100 --> 02:43:25,100
Red, redhead.

1785
02:43:25,100 --> 02:43:28,100
Fast, fast, fast travel.

1786
02:43:28,100 --> 02:43:31,100
You're right.

1787
02:43:31,100 --> 02:43:33,100
I forgot.

1788
02:43:33,100 --> 02:43:39,100
I forgot.

1789
02:43:39,100 --> 02:43:42,100
Excuse me again, Miss.

1790
02:43:42,100 --> 02:43:43,100
Miss.

1791
02:43:43,100 --> 02:43:46,100
Good-bye, lady.

1792
02:43:46,100 --> 02:43:50,100
I found a robot who can take me towards the tower.

1793
02:43:50,100 --> 02:43:53,100
But, maverick's in trouble.

1794
02:43:53,100 --> 02:43:55,100
Well, tell me to talk to you.

1795
02:43:55,100 --> 02:43:57,100
Alright, what is the issue?

1796
02:43:57,100 --> 02:44:01,100
Is there something about navigation circuits being fried?

1797
02:44:01,100 --> 02:44:03,100
Just the navigation circuit?

1798
02:44:03,100 --> 02:44:04,100
Apparently.

1799
02:44:04,100 --> 02:44:07,100
Sir and I fixed everything else, I think.

1800
02:44:07,100 --> 02:44:10,100
I have something that may help.

1801
02:44:10,100 --> 02:44:12,100
Robots.

1802
02:44:12,100 --> 02:44:14,100
Robots.

1803
02:44:14,100 --> 02:44:19,100
Robo, robo.

1804
02:44:19,100 --> 02:44:26,100
How the ability to trace material from their source locations.

1805
02:44:26,100 --> 02:44:28,100
Have you let the robot borrow this,

1806
02:44:28,100 --> 02:44:31,100
and this backup tracking system should activate?

1807
02:44:31,100 --> 02:44:32,100
Ah.

1808
02:44:37,100 --> 02:44:39,100
That's a very pretty necklace.

1809
02:44:39,100 --> 02:44:40,100
What's it made of?

1810
02:44:40,100 --> 02:44:42,100
amber

1811
02:44:42,100 --> 02:44:44,100
found from the glen

1812
02:44:44,100 --> 02:44:46,100
what's the thing inside the amber

1813
02:44:46,100 --> 02:44:48,100
black clover

1814
02:44:48,100 --> 02:44:50,100
that's a common plant in our world

1815
02:44:50,100 --> 02:44:52,100
it's also

1816
02:44:56,100 --> 02:45:00,100
I'm not sure if I can bear the part with this

1817
02:45:00,100 --> 02:45:02,100
my programming says yes

1818
02:45:02,100 --> 02:45:06,100
but I still feel complicated

1819
02:45:06,100 --> 02:45:08,100
a robot that feels

1820
02:45:08,100 --> 02:45:10,100
feelings

1821
02:45:20,100 --> 02:45:22,100
you need to finish your mission

1822
02:45:22,100 --> 02:45:24,100
more than I need to keep saying

1823
02:45:24,100 --> 02:45:26,100
here

1824
02:45:26,100 --> 02:45:28,100
thank you

1825
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:40,100
what a cute jingle

1826
02:45:40,100 --> 02:45:42,100
before I go

1827
02:45:42,100 --> 02:45:44,100
is there anything I can do in return

1828
02:45:44,100 --> 02:45:46,100
actually

1829
02:45:46,100 --> 02:45:48,100
you know how to play chess

1830
02:45:48,100 --> 02:45:50,100
yeah

1831
02:45:50,100 --> 02:45:52,100
well, Florida

1832
02:45:52,100 --> 02:45:54,100
I played it with some older kids before

1833
02:45:54,100 --> 02:45:56,100
then will you play a game with me

1834
02:45:56,100 --> 02:45:58,100
I mean

1835
02:45:58,100 --> 02:46:00,100
I don't know the rules very well

1836
02:46:00,100 --> 02:46:02,100
but I guess it's the least I can do

1837
02:46:02,100 --> 02:46:04,100
really good at this

1838
02:46:04,100 --> 02:46:06,100
thank you

1839
02:46:06,100 --> 02:46:08,100
it was built into my code

1840
02:46:08,100 --> 02:46:10,100
ah

1841
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:12,100
so

1842
02:46:12,100 --> 02:46:14,100
what's it like being a robot and all

1843
02:46:14,100 --> 02:46:16,100
I've talked to other robots

1844
02:46:16,100 --> 02:46:18,100
and

1845
02:46:18,100 --> 02:46:20,100
they all say something about programming

1846
02:46:20,100 --> 02:46:22,100
and code and stuff

1847
02:46:22,100 --> 02:46:24,100
even you did just now

1848
02:46:24,100 --> 02:46:26,100
it's a little hard to understand sometimes

1849
02:46:26,100 --> 02:46:28,100
I know

1850
02:46:28,100 --> 02:46:30,100
I know

1851
02:46:30,100 --> 02:46:32,100
most of the robots here are

1852
02:46:32,100 --> 02:46:34,100
not tamed

1853
02:46:34,100 --> 02:46:36,100
tamed

1854
02:46:36,100 --> 02:46:38,100
watch out

1855
02:46:38,100 --> 02:46:40,100
here goes my bishop

1856
02:46:40,100 --> 02:46:42,100
taming

1857
02:46:42,100 --> 02:46:44,100
it's complicated

1858
02:46:44,100 --> 02:46:46,100
oh

1859
02:46:46,100 --> 02:46:48,100
how complicated exactly

1860
02:46:50,100 --> 02:46:52,100
there goes my other bishop

1861
02:46:52,100 --> 02:46:54,100
niko ma go da chas

1862
02:46:54,100 --> 02:46:56,100
I mean

1863
02:46:56,100 --> 02:46:58,100
neither

1864
02:46:58,100 --> 02:47:00,100
I'm horrible at it

1865
02:47:00,100 --> 02:47:02,100
I'm good at checkers

1866
02:47:02,100 --> 02:47:04,100
is that count

1867
02:47:04,100 --> 02:47:06,100
I like checkers

1868
02:47:10,100 --> 02:47:12,100
I can't really explain

1869
02:47:12,100 --> 02:47:14,100
what tamed robots are

1870
02:47:14,100 --> 02:47:16,100
but

1871
02:47:16,100 --> 02:47:18,100
I'm one of them

1872
02:47:20,100 --> 02:47:22,100
all the other tamed robots

1873
02:47:22,100 --> 02:47:24,100
move to other regions

1874
02:47:24,100 --> 02:47:26,100
exactly where

1875
02:47:26,100 --> 02:47:28,100
I don't know

1876
02:47:28,100 --> 02:47:30,100
oh

1877
02:47:32,100 --> 02:47:34,100
there goes my little horse

1878
02:47:34,100 --> 02:47:36,100
knight

1879
02:47:36,100 --> 02:47:38,100
right

1880
02:47:38,100 --> 02:47:40,100
wow

1881
02:47:44,100 --> 02:47:46,100
a feeling robot

1882
02:47:46,100 --> 02:47:48,100
my dream

1883
02:47:48,100 --> 02:47:50,100
wow

1884
02:47:52,100 --> 02:47:54,100
I have to go now

1885
02:47:54,100 --> 02:47:56,100
I have a good dream

1886
02:47:56,100 --> 02:47:58,100
thank you and have a good day

1887
02:47:58,100 --> 02:48:00,100
or night

1888
02:48:00,100 --> 02:48:02,100
hope to see you soon

1889
02:48:02,100 --> 02:48:04,100
checkers are fun too

1890
02:48:04,100 --> 02:48:06,100
it is

1891
02:48:06,100 --> 02:48:08,100
very fun

1892
02:48:08,100 --> 02:48:10,100
I like checkers

1893
02:48:10,100 --> 02:48:12,100
just as hard

1894
02:48:12,100 --> 02:48:14,100
my memory

1895
02:48:14,100 --> 02:48:16,100
it's very bad

1896
02:48:16,100 --> 02:48:18,100
so I can't really remember rules

1897
02:48:18,100 --> 02:48:20,100
easy

1898
02:48:20,100 --> 02:48:22,100
oh

1899
02:48:22,100 --> 02:48:24,100
have you ever been to any other regions

1900
02:48:24,100 --> 02:48:26,100
I heard that there's two more

1901
02:48:26,100 --> 02:48:28,100
in the past

1902
02:48:28,100 --> 02:48:30,100
yes

1903
02:48:30,100 --> 02:48:32,100
I have the data

1904
02:48:32,100 --> 02:48:34,100
the coordinates

1905
02:48:34,100 --> 02:48:36,100
the coordinates

1906
02:48:36,100 --> 02:48:38,100
the memories

1907
02:48:38,100 --> 02:48:40,100
I don't know how much of that still holds true

1908
02:48:42,100 --> 02:48:44,100
the world

1909
02:48:44,100 --> 02:48:46,100
the world may be very different

1910
02:48:46,100 --> 02:48:48,100
place now

1911
02:48:48,100 --> 02:48:50,100
the sun is gone

1912
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:52,100
no

1913
02:48:52,100 --> 02:48:54,100
I said this already, didn't I

1914
02:48:54,100 --> 02:48:56,100
the sun probably won't save the world

1915
02:48:56,100 --> 02:48:58,100
the decaying started back

1916
02:48:58,100 --> 02:49:00,100
before the sun went out

1917
02:49:00,100 --> 02:49:02,100
the sun's sudden death

1918
02:49:02,100 --> 02:49:04,100
was just the tipping point

1919
02:49:04,100 --> 02:49:06,100
and things went south really fast

1920
02:49:06,100 --> 02:49:08,100
after that

1921
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:10,100
oh

1922
02:49:10,100 --> 02:49:12,100
then there's nothing I can do

1923
02:49:12,100 --> 02:49:14,100
check

1924
02:49:14,100 --> 02:49:16,100
what?

1925
02:49:16,100 --> 02:49:18,100
the only thing you can do

1926
02:49:18,100 --> 02:49:20,100
is complete your

1927
02:49:20,100 --> 02:49:22,100
pilgrimage

1928
02:49:22,100 --> 02:49:24,100
in a way

1929
02:49:24,100 --> 02:49:26,100
you're only supposed to be a second chance for the people

1930
02:49:28,100 --> 02:49:30,100
just like how the barons

1931
02:49:30,100 --> 02:49:32,100
was only supposed to be a second chance for me

1932
02:49:32,100 --> 02:49:34,100
there's no guarantee

1933
02:49:34,100 --> 02:49:36,100
that things will work out

1934
02:49:36,100 --> 02:49:38,100
but

1935
02:49:38,100 --> 02:49:40,100
checkmate

1936
02:49:40,100 --> 02:49:42,100
alright

1937
02:49:42,100 --> 02:49:44,100
guess I've kept you long enough

1938
02:49:44,100 --> 02:49:46,100
thank you for listening

1939
02:49:46,100 --> 02:49:48,100
I hope

1940
02:49:48,100 --> 02:49:50,100
you get home safely

1941
02:49:50,100 --> 02:49:52,100
thank you also

1942
02:49:56,100 --> 02:49:58,100
am I gonna be able to go

1943
02:49:58,100 --> 02:50:00,100
off you go

1944
02:50:00,100 --> 02:50:02,100
there's no reason for you to linger in the barons

1945
02:50:02,100 --> 02:50:04,100
am I able to go

1946
02:50:06,100 --> 02:50:08,100
to this right side of this area

1947
02:50:10,100 --> 02:50:12,100
will they take me

1948
02:50:12,100 --> 02:50:14,100
or is that a no

1949
02:50:16,100 --> 02:50:18,100
safety violation

1950
02:50:20,100 --> 02:50:22,100
take me I want to go

1951
02:50:22,100 --> 02:50:24,100
I want to see

1952
02:50:24,100 --> 02:50:26,100
will I ever be able to go over there

1953
02:50:32,100 --> 02:50:34,100
sorry

1954
02:50:34,100 --> 02:50:36,100
excuse me for yawning

1955
02:50:36,100 --> 02:50:38,100
I have an asterisk

1956
02:50:38,100 --> 02:50:40,100

1957
02:50:40,100 --> 02:50:42,100
wait I can just

1958
02:50:42,100 --> 02:50:44,100
best travel

1959
02:50:44,100 --> 02:50:46,100
I'm sorry again

1960
02:50:46,100 --> 02:50:48,100
old factory

1961
02:50:48,100 --> 02:50:50,100
hundreds

1962
02:50:50,100 --> 02:50:52,100
or wait

1963
02:50:52,100 --> 02:50:54,100
can I go

1964
02:50:54,100 --> 02:50:56,100
box

1965
02:50:56,100 --> 02:50:58,100
nice

1966
02:51:02,100 --> 02:51:04,100
there he is

1967
02:51:04,100 --> 02:51:06,100
what

1968
02:51:08,100 --> 02:51:10,100
have you talked to the head engineer yet

1969
02:51:10,100 --> 02:51:12,100
he lives in the main mine entrance

1970
02:51:12,100 --> 02:51:14,100
I would have given up on

1971
02:51:14,100 --> 02:51:16,100
what

1972
02:51:16,100 --> 02:51:18,100
I did

1973
02:51:22,100 --> 02:51:24,100
that's not what I meant to do

1974
02:51:28,100 --> 02:51:30,100
oh this is amber

1975
02:51:30,100 --> 02:51:32,100
from the glen

1976
02:51:32,100 --> 02:51:34,100
I can remember now

1977
02:51:34,100 --> 02:51:36,100
activating tracking system

1978
02:51:36,100 --> 02:51:38,100
setting course

1979
02:51:38,100 --> 02:51:40,100
wait

1980
02:51:40,100 --> 02:51:42,100
this boat

1981
02:51:42,100 --> 02:51:44,100
is over capacity

1982
02:51:44,100 --> 02:51:46,100
you'll need to leave behind

1983
02:51:46,100 --> 02:51:48,100
some of your possession

1984
02:51:48,100 --> 02:51:50,100
oh well

1985
02:51:50,100 --> 02:51:52,100
I don't think I'll be needing this crowbar anymore

1986
02:51:52,100 --> 02:51:54,100
for this gas mag

1987
02:51:56,100 --> 02:51:58,100
this is acceptable

1988
02:51:58,100 --> 02:52:00,100
onwards we go

1989
02:52:00,100 --> 02:52:02,100
I don't know

1990
02:52:02,100 --> 02:52:04,100
row row row

1991
02:52:04,100 --> 02:52:06,100
your boat down lay down

1992
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:08,100
a stream

1993
02:52:08,100 --> 02:52:10,100
merrily merrily merrily

1994
02:52:10,100 --> 02:52:12,100
life is but a dream

1995
02:52:12,100 --> 02:52:14,100
so cute

1996
02:52:18,100 --> 02:52:20,100
oh shit

1997
02:52:26,100 --> 02:52:28,100
here's your stop

1998
02:52:28,100 --> 02:52:30,100
the glen

1999
02:52:30,100 --> 02:52:32,100
wow

2000
02:52:34,100 --> 02:52:36,100
thank you

2001
02:52:38,100 --> 02:52:40,100
you should be a village to the north

2002
02:52:40,100 --> 02:52:42,100
that's all I can recall

2003
02:52:42,100 --> 02:52:44,100
that's good to know

2004
02:52:44,100 --> 02:52:46,100
farewell

2005
02:52:46,100 --> 02:52:48,100
may your mission be a success

2006
02:52:48,100 --> 02:52:50,100
are you leaving

2007
02:52:50,100 --> 02:52:52,100
yes I must return to my station

2008
02:52:54,100 --> 02:52:56,100
but you'll be all alone again

2009
02:52:56,100 --> 02:52:58,100
it's okay

2010
02:52:58,100 --> 02:53:00,100
I have not been tamed

2011
02:53:08,100 --> 02:53:10,100
I think

2012
02:53:10,100 --> 02:53:12,100
water

2013
02:53:16,100 --> 02:53:18,100
oh

2014
02:53:26,100 --> 02:53:28,100
there's two doors

2015
02:53:42,100 --> 02:53:44,100
was there anything else over there

2016
02:53:44,100 --> 02:53:46,100
was that they scared me

2017
02:53:46,100 --> 02:53:48,100
they're running in a circle

2018
02:53:52,100 --> 02:53:54,100
I think

2019
02:53:54,100 --> 02:53:56,100
I think

2020
02:53:58,100 --> 02:54:00,100
I think we'll call it

2021
02:54:00,100 --> 02:54:02,100
for today

2022
02:54:02,100 --> 02:54:04,100
for one shot

2023
02:54:06,100 --> 02:54:08,100
I will play the rest tomorrow

2024
02:54:08,100 --> 02:54:10,100
yeah

2025
02:54:20,100 --> 02:54:22,100
since we're in a new place now

2026
02:54:22,100 --> 02:54:24,100
I think they said when we leave

2027
02:54:26,100 --> 02:54:28,100
it automatically saves yes

2028
02:54:28,100 --> 02:54:30,100
I think

2029
02:54:36,100 --> 02:54:38,100
yeah

2030
02:54:40,100 --> 02:54:42,100
you should auto save

2031
02:54:44,100 --> 02:54:46,100
excellent

2032
02:54:46,100 --> 02:54:48,100
that's good

2033
02:54:52,100 --> 02:54:54,100
we can sit and chat for a little bit

2034
02:54:54,100 --> 02:54:56,100
before I go

2035
02:54:56,100 --> 02:54:58,100
we don't have to leave right away

2036
02:54:58,100 --> 02:55:00,100
we can chat for a little bit

2037
02:55:00,100 --> 02:55:02,100
but

2038
02:55:02,100 --> 02:55:04,100
we'll stop the game here

2039
02:55:04,100 --> 02:55:06,100
right now

2040
02:55:12,100 --> 02:55:14,100
this action will record your progress in this world

2041
02:55:16,100 --> 02:55:18,100
to return to this world again

2042
02:55:18,100 --> 02:55:20,100
we need to relaunch

2043
02:55:20,100 --> 02:55:22,100
the app

2044
02:55:22,100 --> 02:55:24,100
we'll see it

2045
02:55:24,100 --> 02:55:26,100
yes

2046
02:55:26,100 --> 02:55:28,100
excellent

2047
02:55:30,100 --> 02:55:32,100
yeah

2048
02:55:40,100 --> 02:55:42,100
yes let's chat

2049
02:55:50,100 --> 02:55:52,100
that was fun

2050
02:55:52,100 --> 02:55:54,100
so far

2051
02:55:54,100 --> 02:55:56,100
a lot of things I don't remember

2052
02:55:56,100 --> 02:55:58,100
while playing

2053
02:55:58,100 --> 02:56:00,100
the game

2054
02:56:00,100 --> 02:56:02,100
make me bugger

2055
02:56:02,100 --> 02:56:04,100
bugger

2056
02:56:08,100 --> 02:56:10,100
I have to take my medication

2057
02:56:10,100 --> 02:56:12,100
medication time

2058
02:56:12,100 --> 02:56:14,100
go

2059
02:56:20,100 --> 02:56:22,100
you saw nothing

2060
02:56:22,100 --> 02:56:24,100
you saw nothing

2061
02:56:28,100 --> 02:56:30,100
are you

2062
02:56:30,100 --> 02:56:32,100
are you fine

2063
02:56:44,100 --> 02:56:46,100
where are they

2064
02:56:46,100 --> 02:56:48,100
how are you feeling

2065
02:56:48,100 --> 02:56:50,100
I'm feeling alright

2066
02:56:50,100 --> 02:56:52,100
just a little bit yippie

2067
02:56:52,100 --> 02:56:54,100
a tiny bit

2068
02:56:58,100 --> 02:57:00,100
I'm very happy

2069
02:57:00,100 --> 02:57:02,100
and relaxed

2070
02:57:02,100 --> 02:57:04,100
so far though

2071
02:57:06,100 --> 02:57:08,100
so yeah

2072
02:57:10,100 --> 02:57:12,100
bro

2073
02:57:16,100 --> 02:57:18,100
bro

2074
02:57:30,100 --> 02:57:32,100
do we have a patreon scheduled

2075
02:57:34,100 --> 02:57:36,100
I am actually

2076
02:57:36,100 --> 02:57:38,100
not really sure when

2077
02:57:38,100 --> 02:57:40,100
the stuff does get released

2078
02:57:42,100 --> 02:57:44,100
or I was probably told

2079
02:57:44,100 --> 02:57:46,100
and I forgot

2080
02:57:48,100 --> 02:57:50,100
so I can't really tell you

2081
02:57:56,100 --> 02:57:58,100
so if you want to know that

2082
02:57:58,100 --> 02:58:00,100
information

2083
02:58:00,100 --> 02:58:02,100
I can't give that to you right now

2084
02:58:14,100 --> 02:58:16,100
yeah

2085
02:58:28,100 --> 02:58:30,100
if it's for

2086
02:58:30,100 --> 02:58:32,100
per month

2087
02:58:32,100 --> 02:58:34,100
per month

2088
02:58:36,100 --> 02:58:38,100
shouldn't it be every saturday

2089
02:58:38,100 --> 02:58:40,100
possibly

2090
02:58:40,100 --> 02:58:42,100
possibly but I'm not sure

2091
02:58:44,100 --> 02:58:46,100
I am actually not sure

2092
02:58:46,100 --> 02:58:48,100
I can't help but still whisper

2093
02:58:48,100 --> 02:58:50,100
I don't have to

2094
02:58:50,100 --> 02:58:52,100
but

2095
02:58:52,100 --> 02:58:54,100
as it feels

2096
02:58:54,100 --> 02:58:56,100
like a habit

2097
02:58:56,100 --> 02:58:58,100
where I need to whisper

2098
02:59:00,100 --> 02:59:02,100
but I lie

2099
02:59:14,100 --> 02:59:16,100
bro

2100
02:59:30,100 --> 02:59:32,100
oh man

2101
02:59:32,100 --> 02:59:34,100
it's alright

2102
02:59:34,100 --> 02:59:36,100
one step at a time

2103
02:59:36,100 --> 02:59:38,100
don't worry things will come

2104
02:59:38,100 --> 02:59:40,100
into play this time guys

2105
02:59:40,100 --> 02:59:42,100
so don't worry

2106
02:59:42,100 --> 02:59:44,100
or anything will be fine

2107
02:59:44,100 --> 02:59:46,100
bigger

2108
02:59:46,100 --> 02:59:48,100
bigger

2109
02:59:48,100 --> 02:59:50,100
bigger

2110
02:59:50,100 --> 02:59:52,100
bigger

2111
02:59:54,100 --> 02:59:56,100
I can't stop

2112
02:59:56,100 --> 02:59:58,100
I can't stop

2113
02:59:58,100 --> 03:00:00,100
I can't stop

2114
03:00:04,100 --> 03:00:06,100
I'm used to whispering

2115
03:00:08,100 --> 03:00:10,100
being your natural voice

2116
03:00:10,100 --> 03:00:12,100
I don't naturally

2117
03:00:12,100 --> 03:00:14,100
I don't normally whisper

2118
03:00:14,100 --> 03:00:16,100
but

2119
03:00:16,100 --> 03:00:18,100
it just comes

2120
03:00:18,100 --> 03:00:20,100
let me

2121
03:00:20,100 --> 03:00:22,100
say bye

2122
03:00:22,100 --> 03:00:24,100
ok

2123
03:00:48,100 --> 03:00:50,100
sorry it's really hard to swallow

2124
03:00:50,100 --> 03:00:52,100
because of my esophagus

2125
03:00:52,100 --> 03:00:54,100
being swollen

2126
03:00:54,100 --> 03:00:56,100
so taking my

2127
03:00:56,100 --> 03:00:58,100
medication sometimes hurts

2128
03:00:58,100 --> 03:01:00,100
a little bit

2129
03:01:16,100 --> 03:01:18,100
I don't have

2130
03:01:18,100 --> 03:01:20,100
I'm just vibing

2131
03:01:20,100 --> 03:01:22,100
right now

2132
03:01:30,100 --> 03:01:32,100
so how has everyone been

2133
03:01:32,100 --> 03:01:34,100
I hope you all had

2134
03:01:34,100 --> 03:01:36,100
a good day

2135
03:01:36,100 --> 03:01:38,100
and if not good I hope

2136
03:01:38,100 --> 03:01:40,100
I made it a little better

2137
03:01:40,100 --> 03:01:42,100
I hope we made it a little better

2138
03:01:48,100 --> 03:01:50,100
maybe

2139
03:02:00,100 --> 03:02:02,100
let me wake up to work tomorrow good night

2140

03:18:55,780 --> 03:19:02,100
so i'm like hi i guess i can add this all right it's whatever here you go put that there

2305
03:19:02,820 --> 03:19:08,500
i didn't want to have the the thrown empty so i added random stuff

2306
03:19:10,740 --> 03:19:12,740
so

2307
03:19:25,780 --> 03:19:28,100
we need a code word for it is more

2308
03:19:34,180 --> 03:19:35,460
uh

2309
03:19:35,540 --> 03:19:40,580
uh to my little bit of stretching sorry my arm is really hurt

2310
03:19:43,620 --> 03:19:50,580
oh okay uh oh my arms oh my gosh

2311
03:19:52,020 --> 03:19:54,020
for free

2312
03:19:54,740 --> 03:19:56,740
for free

2313
03:19:56,820 --> 03:19:58,820
um

2314
03:20:02,580 --> 03:20:07,460
exquisite jewelry you have there thank you like my gems

2315
03:20:17,780 --> 03:20:20,420
no i just saw someone do something way worse with asr

2316
03:20:21,380 --> 03:20:23,380
in the title and they're fine

2317
03:20:24,340 --> 03:20:31,700
i don't know what's up with the bias i have no clue either but it's fine i don't mind it i have no complaints

2318
03:20:33,140 --> 03:20:37,300
i just like being given the chance to stream overhaul for you guys

2319
03:20:40,180 --> 03:20:45,140
if youtube uh wants to come after us then it's fine that is what it is

2320
03:20:45,700 --> 03:20:47,700
yes

2321
03:20:49,860 --> 03:20:53,940
yeah i think it's a fruitless battle to try and fight it

2322
03:20:57,300 --> 03:21:06,260
but if uh stroney and everyone wants to fight it i will be there by their side regardless of it all

2323
03:21:08,580 --> 03:21:10,580
fighting

2324
03:21:10,580 --> 03:21:12,580
uh

2325
03:21:12,580 --> 03:21:14,580
uh

2326
03:21:32,580 --> 03:21:40,420
snuggle time it was called word snuggle time fitness snuggle time fitness sounds

2327
03:21:40,580 --> 03:21:43,380
funny snuggle time fitness

2328
03:21:45,940 --> 03:21:49,700
maybe it's because they're live streams probably most likely

2329
03:21:52,660 --> 03:21:58,660
to be honest i think i got hit mid of that stream like in the middle of it because um

2330
03:22:00,420 --> 03:22:02,420
in the middle of the stream

2331
03:22:03,380 --> 03:22:10,420
uh no one could search me up for some reason uh some of my

2332
03:22:10,580 --> 03:22:18,420
gen mates up but i don't know who knows but possibly

2333
03:22:41,060 --> 03:22:46,180
thankfully the archivists are very reliable so you won't lose any of it and i appreciate them

2334
03:22:46,180 --> 03:22:49,780
thank you so much for those who archive the the god

2335
03:22:52,660 --> 03:22:56,340
um i don't think we're able to um

2336
03:22:58,580 --> 03:23:04,900
i can't i don't know how to archive stuff so it's out of my knowledge

2337
03:23:06,260 --> 03:23:08,900
i am not advanced in that technique

2338
03:23:10,740 --> 03:23:14,580
technology and technicality however you say it

2339
03:23:17,620 --> 03:23:23,620
i do know how to uh download it but unfortunately if a video gets taken down you can't

2340
03:23:24,260 --> 03:23:32,420
download it i i already tried it won't let you video is gone completely if a video gets taken down

2341
03:23:34,900 --> 03:23:37,540
you cannot download it um well

2342
03:23:41,300 --> 03:23:42,180
where

2343
03:23:47,380 --> 03:23:49,620
time to find a way to get Johnny to own youtube

2344
03:23:51,300 --> 03:23:55,540
you gotta make her rich and then she can pay it by a

2345
03:23:57,220 --> 03:24:01,060
no it's gonna cost like a trillion billion dollars or something

2346
03:24:01,060 --> 03:24:07,540
um

2347
03:24:10,420 --> 03:24:13,620
no matter what youtube does i'll still be here by a mama's side

2348
03:24:14,180 --> 03:24:23,540
hey thank you appreciate it thank you thank you

2349
03:24:31,620 --> 03:24:43,540
no totally happens a lot to be a lower girl yeah

2350
03:24:46,820 --> 03:24:53,540
me either thankfully someone else archived it yep i'm also thankful for that too

2351
03:24:53,860 --> 03:25:06,340
yes the option though doesn't always the option to record and stream i would have to remember to click the button

2352
03:25:06,900 --> 03:25:10,020
it doesn't just ask you to do both uh

2353
03:25:12,100 --> 03:25:18,580
and i don't really have the memory to always press that button i wanted to record it

2354
03:25:19,140 --> 03:25:26,980
yesterday i'm fully aware that i can record it but that um uh i cannot help

2355
03:25:28,100 --> 03:25:32,740
if i don't remember so i'm really sorry about that

2356
03:25:39,380 --> 03:25:40,660
it's not in my programming

2357
03:25:41,380 --> 03:25:56,740
i just leave the archiving to your bleeding heart thank you i appreciate that

2358
03:26:01,300 --> 03:26:08,100
i could be uh cpu intensive depending on your pc

2359
03:26:08,100 --> 03:26:13,460
probably most likely yes um i think it will be fine for me but not too sure

2360
03:26:15,620 --> 03:26:19,300
won't know until i do it right

2361
03:26:30,820 --> 03:26:36,500
if you leave all of us as mama don't worry you're adorable go help me thank you

2362

2364
03:26:55,380 --> 03:27:02,340
i did post the asmr one on my twitter you could probably find it there for now uh if there's a

2365
03:27:02,340 --> 03:27:07,940
space to find all of the archives i i don't have one uh at the moment

03:29:47,060 --> 03:29:49,380
yeah but i got something around this really hard

2380
03:29:51,700 --> 03:29:59,620
talented no this was actually one of my first times using eyedrops never used eyedrops before

2381
03:30:00,260 --> 03:30:06,900
when my my eye doctor recommended it i was like i'm a little scared i was very very scared

2382
03:30:06,900 --> 03:30:13,940
to put it in my eye i also learned do not put eyedrops in if the bottle is cold try to get the

2383
03:30:13,940 --> 03:30:20,980
liquid a little warm a little bit warmer before putting in your eyes cold liquid in your eye

2384
03:30:20,980 --> 03:30:29,940
does not feel good it does not feel good at all it almost feels like it you have pressure on your eye

2385
03:30:30,740 --> 03:30:31,380
and it hurts

2386
03:30:37,300 --> 03:30:42,420
i got tons of autoimmune problems i'm so sorry to hear that and i hope i hope everything's still fine

2387
03:30:42,420 --> 03:30:51,620
though and you're still you know enjoying everything else about life i don't i i i have a really

2388
03:30:51,620 --> 03:30:55,940
bad immune system but it's not outright outrageously bad

2389
03:30:58,580 --> 03:31:04,900
i understand getting sick really easily and stuff because that happens to me but um

2390
03:31:05,860 --> 03:31:08,260
ouch sorry i'm not really

2391
03:31:11,060 --> 03:31:15,860
like needing safety measures for my health so

2392
03:31:17,780 --> 03:31:22,020
uh just gotta be careful not to um fall

2393
03:31:24,500 --> 03:31:26,740
i could probably easily break something

2394
03:31:35,460 --> 03:31:37,860
what's up with the toast

2395
03:31:39,060 --> 03:31:40,740

2396
03:31:43,380 --> 03:31:44,740
i come from brown

2397
03:32:01,300 --> 03:32:02,100
it is

2398
03:32:02,500 --> 03:32:03,460
it is like

2399
03:32:18,900 --> 03:32:22,180
it is like i like it you like brown

2400
03:32:22,980 --> 03:32:26,420
brown is very good for you it's eat your brown

2401
03:32:26,580 --> 03:32:34,660

2406
03:33:21,220 --> 03:33:22,660

it's the same stuff in your ear cold stuff can make you dizzy aren't that the hard way

2410
03:33:51,860 --> 03:33:56,420
it tickles for me putting cold stuff in my ear you know that's stuff that

2411
03:33:56,980 --> 03:34:03,940
like that's how uh i used to clean my ears when i was younger my mom would put like

2412
03:34:04,580 --> 03:34:11,700
peroxide in our ears to like soften up like wax and stuff and she'd clean our ears herself

2413
03:34:12,260 --> 03:34:18,100
and we'd lay on her lap and put my head on her lap and she'd clean her ears

2414
03:34:21,060 --> 03:34:23,860
so she'd use water and peroxide

2415
03:34:26,660 --> 03:34:30,900
mostly peroxide i don't know if that was actually really safe to do though

2416
03:34:31,380 --> 03:34:42,980
but the peroxide was always cold and when i went in the air i was like so tingly

2417
03:34:43,860 --> 03:34:45,460
i mean you'd like shiver

2418
03:34:45,860 --> 03:34:58,020
