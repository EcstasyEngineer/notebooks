330000	334000	alright
334000	338000	why
338000	342000	I'm wondering how much I'm going to be
342000	346000	I was setting up
346000	357000	stuff for today. I added the merch thingies on there. You see that? On there. Look at that. Right there.
357000	373000	I added the merch and I added alerts and a bunch of new things. It was really hard trying to set it all up.
373000	378000	So I'm glad it went okay.
379000	384000	Um, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
386000	392000	As I believe I am not. So I'm 20, 30. What is called your book?
392000	398000	Or if my bullies wrote in that. I never amount to anything.
398000	403000	Your amount to so much more. Do not believe your bullies. They mean nothing.
403000	408000	Alright, you are everything and you are what?
410000	413000	I already want you to be.
417000	421000	You are great. You are amazing.
421000	425000	And you're all good boys and good girls.
425000	430000	Oops. Yeah, yeah.
435000	443000	Come on. Are you okay? I'm okay. Just a lot of energy. A lot, a lot, a lot of energy. I'm sorry.
456000	474000	I'm having like a bit of issue on Twitter at the moment where people are sending me art or um, they're putting the tag in their art and stuff.
474000	485000	Unfortunately, when I click on the tags, a lot of the art and um, memes and stuff that you guys sent me, some of it do not appear in there.
485000	489000	So I'm really sorry if I missed some of your art and stuff.
489000	493000	I'm really sorry. I'm so sorry.
494000	509000	So I do get some of your stuff, but I have to like literally be sent some stuff that get unseen.
510000	521000	So Twitter has hit you with anything or you know, they're probably not letting you, your hashtags get seen.
521000	528000	Unfortunately, Twitter, Twitter being Twitter, yeah, yeah, yeah. I agree.
529000	539000	Sorry, I do not take DMs. They have no clothes.
539000	544000	I know that's what the hashtags are for, but don't worry.
544000	550000	We'll sort it itself out, I'm sure. We'll sort it itself out.
558000	577000	It helps for people to comment under posts with the tags, weird Twitter thing. I didn't know that.
577000	583000	Maybe it does. I know when some people comment, that's how I end up seeing some of the posts.
583000	592000	Um, so I end up seeing it only because someone else responded or retweeted that, so I end up seeing it.
592000	600000	Oh, that's me! Understand.
600000	604000	Yeah, it seems a bit ginky today. Very ginky.
604000	607000	Here you go, yo, yo, yo.
617000	620000	Don't let Michael Kong go.
620000	630000	Those eyes are very hypnotic, are they?
650000	665000	Have you eaten today, Azu? Have I eaten today?
680000	690000	Yeah, yeah, no, I haven't eaten.
710000	720000	I'll eat, I promise, I promise, I promise.
720000	729000	I promise, I promise, I'll eat, I'll eat, I'll eat. I have more cookies, does that count?
729000	739000	More cookies. I had cookies. I kind of ate them before I started, so I only have one left.
740000	758000	I don't have, no, no, eat actual food.
758000	765000	Fine, fine, alright, I'll eat something, I promise. I promise, I promise.
765000	774000	Yes, I pinky promise, I pinky swear.
774000	778000	You guys don't want your astronomy? Please don't, no!
778000	783000	My bag, my bag, my bag. Please stop. I don't do it.
783000	791000	It's not worth it. It's not, I swear, it's not worth it.
791000	797000	Yes, after a stream, I'll eat a proper meal.
797000	811000	Am I too close? Let me back up. E.
811000	820000	Money, money, close.
821000	824000	If you pass out, we're going to be upsetty spaghetti.
824000	832000	No, I won, I promise, I promise, I'll be fine. I've been drinking lots of water.
832000	848000	Aren't you proud of me? Water.
848000	855000	I have a fan on, so let me know if the fan is bothering the mic, okay?
855000	868000	Thank you. This is the first fan I've ever had. I've never had a fan before.
868000	877000	I've had an AC, but that broke, so I don't have AC. It's currently still in my window, broken.
877000	891000	It doesn't work. I used to hate it so much, because every time I turned on the AC, it would like literally turn off my power.
891000	916000	I'm not used to my own alert.
916000	938000	Water is important. Yes, I'm migrating.
939000	946000	And they're fine, they're my fans now. Yay! And I appreciate every last one of you.
946000	950000	Thank you so much for the subscriptions.
950000	958000	Is that what they call them? Subscription? Does that sound weird, or is it just subscribers?
958000	967000	Is subscriptions weird, or is subscribers better?
967000	974000	So subscribe! If you're not subscribed, subscribe!
974000	981000	Smash that like button. Is there still a bell?
981000	987000	And click on that little bell, or something like that. Is it like that?
987000	999000	Yeah, there was a big purge. I had 4k, and then it died.
999000	1007000	I came back and I had 2.8k. Wow, that was massive purge. It was a big, big purge.
1007000	1016000	It's alright, I don't mind. I'm having fun just hanging out with you guys. I don't mind this at all.
1016000	1028000	I'm actually really procrastinating right now. I'm really scared to play the game.
1028000	1037000	I'm procrastinating.
1047000	1053000	Am I good with horror at all? No.
1054000	1060000	Okay, let's put it this way. There was a game that I played a long time ago.
1060000	1072000	I played this game. I was suggested to play this game, and I'm not good when it comes to feeling like I'm being chased.
1072000	1082000	And it got up to that part in the game, and I screamed so hard that I started drooling.
1082000	1091000	I was screaming nonstop, and I was drooling and screaming and drooling.
1113000	1121000	I thought it would be fun if I got a heart monitor to track my heart rate.
1121000	1134000	Because, low and surprised, I didn't mention this yesterday, but I actually have, when I said towards the end of the stream, I said that I take medication.
1134000	1142000	Yes, one of the medications is actually for my heart.
1148000	1152000	So that would be really interesting if I got a heart rate monitor.
1152000	1158000	So I put it on the wishlist.
1159000	1164000	I'll be okay. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll be okay. I'll be okay.
1164000	1168000	That's what the medication is for.
1168000	1183000	I think I was fighting for her life. I was. I really was, and then I didn't even get past the first part of the game.
1183000	1189000	And then someone told me that that part of the game was actually the tutorial.
1189000	1205000	Some time later, it was the tutorial. I haven't even gotten it to the actual game, and I never opened the game again.
1220000	1227000	The biggest chance is that I'll probably cry.
1227000	1235000	I'll probably start weeping and crying. And if anything, I'll probably ask one of the gen-mates to help me.
1235000	1240000	Please, please, someone, anyone come in here and comfort me.
1240000	1247000	Maybe hopefully one of them will come help in, you know, give me some good old slap on the back, you know.
1247000	1273000	I know some goats who do that do faint, but I don't know.
1273000	1278000	I have fainted before, so I think good gods can faint.
1278000	1296000	Yeah, I'll be super bored.
1296000	1301000	I'm brave. I'm sure this game isn't that scary. I'm sure it's fine.
1301000	1311000	I'm sure it's okay, and I'm gonna get right through it and be just fine.
1311000	1328000	I'm so ready. I'm so ready. I'm so excited to play this game. I'm gonna do amazing things.
1329000	1334000	That's right.
1334000	1346000	Well, hello everyone who's just now coming and welcome and hi, hi, hi.
1347000	1355000	I hope all of you have been well yourselves, yes? You all had a good day. You've all eaten breakfast, lunch or dinner.
1355000	1360000	Brush your teeth.
1360000	1378000	Showered.
1378000	1382000	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1382000	1391000	That's right. That's right. That's what I call good boys and girls.
1391000	1401000	Nyeom, nyeom, nyeom, nyeom, nyeom, nyeom, nyeom, nyeom, nyeom, nyeom.
1401000	1408000	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1408000	1413000	My God, is that a sword to lay? Yes it is! It's me, a sword to lay.
1413000	1420000	Okay, the fertility goddess, Apia Lojas, Gen 1, and Dolce.
1428000	1431000	Why is the first king me streaming a horror game?
1431000	1436000	I don't know, I thought I like, I wanted to add a little spiciness to it.
1436000	1439000	You know, to the weak, little spicy.
1440000	1444000	A little bit of spice.
1444000	1450000	Because we're gonna be biving the rest of the week, you know, chilling, biving.
1450000	1459000	I really wanted to say, there was a lot of medication that I was on for my stomach.
1459000	1465000	Because they found like internal, you know, internal bleeds and stuff.
1465000	1473000	And some issues with my stomach and yadda yadda yadda erosion, yadda yadda yadda, you know, ulcers, yadda yadda yadda.
1473000	1476000	All of the whatnot, blah blah blah.
1476000	1480000	I was on some really heavy medication.
1480000	1486000	Some butt medication.
1486000	1492000	And it was really, it was really making me super woozy.
1492000	1496000	I was being really, really slourish.
1496000	1500000	It made me tired, really sleepy.
1500000	1507000	But yay, I just got a notice from my doctor that I don't have to take them anymore.
1507000	1514000	And the one thing that those medications did to me that I was kind of a little sad and disappointed on,
1514000	1521000	I was on that medication for about a year, a whole year I was on that medication.
1522000	1527000	Or like close to a year, not really a whole year.
1527000	1530000	But I was on that medication for a long time.
1530000	1539000	But what I couldn't do well on that medication and taking oral medication as well,
1539000	1545000	because I had to take both for the stomach and butt medication.
1545000	1550000	A booty, booty medication.
1550000	1554000	I couldn't drink. I couldn't have alcohol.
1554000	1559000	I couldn't drink for a whole like almost a year.
1559000	1562000	I wasn't allowed to drink.
1568000	1573000	I wasn't allowed to have all the alcohols. I was so sad.
1574000	1582000	And now, now I'm able to drink again.
1582000	1589000	Yay! I'm so happy. It's been so long.
1591000	1594000	Yay!
1595000	1598000	We're off the land, yay!
1598000	1602000	We're so lonely, healing, slowly.
1602000	1610000	I still can't eat certain things or make me go blah, but I'm slowly healing.
1610000	1617000	Yeah, that means streaming, that means drinking streams are good to go.
1617000	1626000	Yeah, and I wanted to celebrate a little bit with everything that's happening.
1626000	1636000	So, I'm probably gonna go do a bit of drinking on the, I think it's the 8th.
1636000	1639000	I'm probably gonna do a little bit of drinking.
1639000	1646000	So I might come back for super, I think we're playing in supermarkets and later,
1646000	1651000	I might be a little a little bit dizzy.
1651000	1653000	Welcome back.
1660000	1662000	Little tipsy.
1664000	1675000	It's me celebrating with my fans, me getting off medication and stuff and all the things that I missed out on.
1676000	1680000	Celebrate from now, come on!
1683000	1687000	Celebrate from now, come on!
1706000	1708000	What's my favorite drink?
1708000	1712000	My favorite drink is soju. Actually, I like soju a lot.
1712000	1723000	I'm not keen on the really, how you call it, bitter, bitterness of drinks.
1723000	1728000	I have an extreme sweet tooth, like a really bad sweet tooth.
1728000	1730000	So I really like sweet drinks.
1730000	1732000	So I really like soju.
1732000	1738000	I drink all the flavors so far, not all, most of all the flavors so far.
1738000	1744000	I think I like peach a lot, peach and the strawberry, the mango one's pretty good.
1744000	1748000	I like yogurt as well, it's good.
1748000	1751000	And green, is it green crepe?
1751000	1753000	Green crepe?
1753000	1755000	Yeah, an example.
1761000	1763000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1780000	1783000	Yeah, crepe soju is really good too.
1784000	1794000	I think soju has 12% so I think that's pretty a lot.
1794000	1797000	I don't think that's a little bit.
1797000	1804000	It's either 6% to 12% so I think that's a little bit.
1804000	1819000	I also, for regular drinks, I guess my two favorite drinks would be amaretto sour.
1819000	1823000	And what's the other one sour?
1823000	1829000	Amaretto sour and jet.
1829000	1832000	There's another one.
1833000	1835000	Something, something, other sour?
1835000	1837000	No, not lemon sour.
1837000	1844000	Amaretto sour and it kind of looks and tastes like ginger ale.
1850000	1855000	Samurai sour is green and the other one is like, looks like ginger ale.
1855000	1857000	I don't know, what?
1857000	1859000	I can't remember the name.
1859000	1861000	What's the name?
1861000	1864000	I can't remember.
1864000	1867000	No, not whiskey sour.
1877000	1882000	I really can't remember, I can't remember.
1885000	1889000	Yeah, there's a berry soju, the strawberry soju.
1892000	1897000	I actually really don't like beer.
1897000	1900000	It smells like pee-pee.
1900000	1903000	It smells like pee-pee.
1903000	1906000	Oh, like beer.
1906000	1912000	My first experience with beer was that it smelled like pee-pee and tasted like mop water.
1912000	1915000	You ever smelled dirty mop water?
1915000	1917000	Ever just smelled it?
1917000	1919000	And you can smell what you taste.
1919000	1922000	You can taste what you smell, I mean.
1929000	1932000	I hate beer, me and me too.
1937000	1941000	Yeah, it's a midori sour.
1941000	1943000	Amaretto sour and midori sour.
1943000	1950000	Midori sour is green and amaretto looks like, I mixed it up.
1950000	1957000	Yeah, amaretto looks like, looks like ginger ale.
1957000	1959000	Oh my god, I had a brain fart.
1959000	1962000	Yeah, yeah, I had it mixed up, I had it mixed up.
1962000	1964000	Midori and amaretto sour.
1964000	1968000	Those are the two of my favorite sweet drinks I like.
1969000	1972000	Midori, midori sour and amaretto sour.
1976000	1978000	I had the midori too mixed up.
1978000	1982000	Midori is green and amaretto looks like ginger ale.
1982000	1984000	Dirty mop water is stinky.
1984000	1988000	Yeah, imagine tasting beer and it tastes like that smell.
1993000	1996000	That was the first time I ever drunk beer and it was horrible.
1996000	1998000	I hated it.
1998000	2000000	I was so bad.
2007000	2013000	There is some good beer out there, but because of that one experience,
2013000	2015000	I tend to try to stay away from it.
2019000	2022000	Do you remember the beer? No, because it was at a bar.
2022000	2025000	It was at a bar, it was my first, it was in a picture.
2025000	2033000	And there was like a, like sort of, sort of like a sale, I guess.
2033000	2039000	So it was like really crowded and you got a picture for like, I think a dollar or something.
2039000	2041000	I gave you dirt beer.
2041000	2043000	I was a dirt beer.
2051000	2053000	It was at a bar, I was a first amaretto.
2055000	2057000	I had a beer.
2057000	2060000	It was in a really large picture.
2065000	2067000	How about non-alcoholic beer?
2067000	2071000	I don't think I ever had a non-alcoholic beer.
2071000	2075000	I've had a other beer.
2075000	2078000	Ah, hi everyone, hi.
2078000	2080000	Hi Emmy.
2080000	2082000	What come in?
2083000	2085000	Hi, hi.
2085000	2088000	Welcome everyone from Emmy's stream.
2088000	2091000	How did you all enjoy her stream?
2096000	2098000	Hi, hi, welcome in.
2101000	2107000	I, I saw Emmy did an ASMR stream today.
2107000	2113000	I, did you all enjoy the ASMR from Emmy?
2113000	2117000	I watched a little bit, I enjoyed it.
2120000	2122000	How are you doing, Emmy?
2123000	2125000	Hi Nana.
2132000	2134000	Hi.
2138000	2141000	Oh, ouch.
2143000	2145000	I'm sweaty and stinky.
2145000	2147000	I need to go shower.
2147000	2150000	Well, thank you so much for the little bread.
2150000	2152000	I appreciate it.
2152000	2155000	Go ahead and wash up so you're not a little stinker.
2155000	2157000	Nice and clean.
2157000	2159000	What?
2164000	2169000	So I hope the vibes meet you all well while you're all in here for now.
2169000	2173000	After such an amazing ASMR stream.
2173000	2175000	Sniff, sniff, sniff.
2187000	2189000	Sniff, sniff.
2193000	2195000	Sniff, sniff.
2199000	2201000	Sniff, sniff.
2201000	2203000	Sniff, sniff.
2209000	2211000	Sniff, sniff.
2211000	2214000	Yes, we do.
2214000	2240000	If you guys don't know, I do get 100% of merch sales, so if you guys really want to support me that way, you can indeed buy my merch and I get 100% of the merch.
2245000	2248000	Thank you for bringing that up, thank you.
2248000	2251000	I didn't get forgot about that yesterday.
2253000	2257000	You played this game 3 years ago, it's quite the surreal experience.
2257000	2258000	Oh god.
2261000	2263000	I'm so ready.
2264000	2267000	Should we stop procrastinating and start playing now?
2269000	2272000	Should we stop procrastinating?
2274000	2275000	Haha.
2284000	2285000	What's up?
2288000	2295000	You really like the design on the pant leg on your merch? Thank you, I'm glad you like it.
2296000	2299000	I forgot to mention I bought a t-shirt yesterday too.
2299000	2301000	There's also a t-shirt on there.
2301000	2310000	A sweater, a sweatpants, a t-shirt, a keychain and a standee.
2312000	2316000	If you get all of them, you can be even closer to me.
2316000	2322000	Hold me close to your heart, put me on your keys on your most important object when you're outside.
2322000	2324000	One of your most important objects.
2325000	2326000	Haha.
2338000	2340000	Are we ready? Are we ready?
2341000	2343000	Are we ready when you are?
2344000	2345000	Ready when you are?
2345000	2348000	You should play League on stream, I love League.
2348000	2353000	Maybe, maybe once in a while, like in a blue moon, I will.
2353000	2355000	Maybe do a morning stream.
2357000	2359000	So I have two streams in one day.
2359000	2364000	One for League and one for another game or something.
2364000	2366000	I can do that.
2366000	2370000	If you really, really, really want me to.
2374000	2382000	But it's not gonna be a comment, they play it on stream.
2382000	2383000	Yeah.
2388000	2391000	Isn't the longest I've seen someone chatting.
2391000	2395000	That goes two hour away before.
2401000	2403000	Any good anime coming out this season?
2403000	2411000	I haven't actually looked at the summer season anime yet.
2411000	2413000	I haven't looked at any trailers yet.
2413000	2415000	I am not sure.
2415000	2421000	Maybe when I see a video come out or I get a notification, we can watch it together.
2421000	2423000	If that's allowed.
2423000	2426000	Cause I don't think that's allowed.
2434000	2437000	I really don't mind if you guys fall asleep to my streams.
2437000	2438000	I do not mind.
2438000	2440000	It's understandable.
2441000	2449000	If you find me very relaxing, snoozing and the vibes are that real for you.
2449000	2452000	Then it's understandable that you'd fall asleep.
2453000	2458000	If I listen to myself, I probably fall asleep too after doing a little bit of cringing.
2461000	2462000	Yuck.
2463000	2465000	I hear myself yuck.
2465000	2466000	Ew.
2472000	2477000	Don't get it started on anime.
2487000	2492000	Someone mentioned Rama One Half yesterday and I didn't see it.
2492000	2496000	And I ended up seeing it when I was going through comments.
2496000	2500000	And I was like, someone mentioned Rama One Half!
2500000	2502000	Oh, I'm sorry.
2502000	2504000	I love Rama!
2504000	2508000	My favorite voice actors in Rama One Half.
2510000	2513000	Sorry, the thought just popped into my head.
2516000	2518000	Remember this?
2520000	2521000	I love Rama One Half.
2521000	2526000	Rama is my favorite voice actor and I really love Ryuga a lot.
2526000	2528000	Ryuga is one of my favorite characters.
2528000	2530000	If you ask me who my favorite character is.
2533000	2534000	In Rama.
2537000	2539000	I mean, I watched the Inuyasha series.
2539000	2541000	Like, come on, how can I not like Rama?
2545000	2547000	Shampoo is your favorite?
2547000	2548000	I like shampoo too.
2549000	2552000	I love that her grandma's name is Cologne.
2552000	2553000	What a combination.
2554000	2555000	Cologne and shampoo.
2556000	2557000	Shampoo.
2575000	2577000	You want a bedtime story later?
2577000	2580000	Maybe I can read you one after we play a scary game.
2580000	2582000	Because, you know, we're playing a scary game.
2583000	2585000	I don't know if we're all too scared.
2585000	2588000	I might like, soothe you all up.
2596000	2598000	Shampoo is best girl.
2598000	2601000	Her OST is my favorite in Inuyasha.
2601000	2605000	I really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really like her OST.
2605000	2607000	It's one of my favorites.
2613000	2614000	Shampoo.
2627000	2628000	No way.
2630000	2631000	No way.
2632000	2633000	I didn't.
2634000	2635000	No way.
2643000	2646000	I don't know what you're talking about.
2646000	2649000	It was place the entire time.
2649000	2652000	It was place the entire time.
2656000	2658000	I don't know what you're talking about.
2658000	2659000	What?
2659000	2660000	That's crazy.
2660000	2661000	What?
2662000	2663000	What?
2666000	2667000	No.
2667000	2669000	No, no, no, no.
2673000	2676000	It was place the whole time.
2676000	2678000	What you're talking about?
2679000	2680000	Swing pace?
2680000	2681000	What?
2681000	2683000	I didn't add that.
2683000	2684000	What?
2684000	2685000	What?
2700000	2702000	Well, anyway, it's time to game.
2702000	2704000	Let's go game.
2704000	2707000	Let's go game, yeah.
2712000	2713000	We're gaming.
2713000	2714000	We're so gaming.
2714000	2716000	We're so ready.
2716000	2719000	We're so ready to game.
2719000	2721000	Are we all so ready?
2722000	2725000	Yes, time.
2726000	2728000	It's so time.
2729000	2731000	I'm so ready.
2735000	2738000	Let me know if the game sound is really loud.
2738000	2740000	It's hella loud for me.
2740000	2742000	It's all loud.
2743000	2745000	Turn it up for me.
2745000	2748000	For me, for me, for me.
2748000	2750000	For me, for me.
2750000	2752000	For me.
2752000	2754000	For me.
2758000	2760000	For me.
2763000	2766000	A little loud for you guys too.
2766000	2768000	Gotcha.
2773000	2775000	How's this? Is this better or no?
2775000	2777000	No, it's still even louder for me.
2777000	2779000	I'm gonna turn it down here.
2780000	2782000	Is it better?
2795000	2796000	Better.
2796000	2797000	Awesome.
2797000	2798000	Excellent.
2798000	2800000	Let's add some ambience.
2800000	2802000	Yeah.
2802000	2804000	Ambience.
2820000	2822000	Is my head too big?
2824000	2826000	Am I too big?
2827000	2829000	Am I in the way?
2830000	2832000	Am I massive?
2832000	2834000	Am I too small?
2842000	2844000	I'll be doing Vans here.
2844000	2846000	It's on.
2846000	2848000	Let me turn that off.
2853000	2855000	It's too small.
2855000	2857000	No.
2873000	2875000	I'm ready.
2875000	2878000	I'm so ready to game.
2878000	2881000	I'm so ready.
2881000	2884000	I'm so excited.
2884000	2886000	Oh, yeah.
2886000	2888000	I'm so very excited.
2888000	2890000	Cannot wait.
2890000	2892000	Wow.
2892000	2894000	I'm so excited.
2894000	2896000	Can't wait.
2903000	2906000	My heart is already hurting.
2914000	2917000	I don't like the music.
2917000	2920000	I don't like it. Can I turn it down?
2926000	2928000	Yeah.
2934000	2936000	Okay.
2937000	2939000	Okay.
2939000	2941000	I'm ready.
2941000	2943000	Let's do this.
2953000	2955000	Oh, my God.
2955000	2957000	Okay.
2957000	2959000	Okay.
2959000	2961000	Okay.
2961000	2964000	A place forbidden, everyone.
2964000	2966000	A place forbidden, everyone.
2966000	2968000	A place forbidden.
2968000	2971000	I honestly don't really know much about the game.
2974000	2976000	This story is a help.
2976000	2978000	Isn't my apartment?
2980000	2982000	Then what are we doing in it?
2982000	2984000	If it's in your apartment?
2985000	2988000	I definitely didn't fall asleep in this chair.
2989000	2991000	Okay.
2991000	2993000	It's kind of spooky.
2994000	2996000	Uh...
3001000	3003000	What's that?
3003000	3005000	What is this?
3005000	3007000	A book for ants?
3017000	3019000	Is there a way to run?
3019000	3021000	Do you only walk slow?
3024000	3026000	Yeah.
3026000	3028000	Pretty depressing.
3033000	3035000	Um...
3035000	3037000	Oh, I...
3037000	3039000	I...
3039000	3041000	Okay. We're fine.
3045000	3047000	I was...
3054000	3056000	I was...
3056000	3058000	I was...

3064000	3066000	I was...
3066000	3068000	I was...
3068000	3070000	I was...
3070000	3072000	I was...
3072000	3074000	I was scared.
3074000	3076000	I was scared.
3076000	3078000	Okay.
3078000	3080000	I can do this.
3080000	3083000	I'm the one that wanted to do this.
3083000	3085000	I...
3085000	3087000	I'm fine. Everything's fine.
3087000	3089000	Everything's fine.
3094000	3096000	Okay.

3129000	3131000	Greetings for your visitor.
3135000	3140000	There are more than welcome to sign your name and a date of your visit in this class book.
3140000	3142000	Once you've done that,
3142000	3145000	we welcome you to explore the library to your heart's content
3145000	3148000	as long as it isn't after closing.
3148000	3150000	Once you've had your fill,
3150000	3152000	please let yourself out.
3152000	3154000	We'll find a key to the front door
3154000	3157000	on one of the desks in the study.
3170000	3172000	Oh, God.
3172000	3174000	Oh.
3174000	3176000	Okay.
3176000	3178000	Okay, we're fine.
3178000	3180000	What's in here?
3180000	3182000	Okay, it doesn't look like it's plugged in.
3182000	3184000	Unresponsive.
3184000	3186000	The mouse on the floor.
3186000	3188000	Oh.
3188000	3190000	Oh.
3190000	3192000	Oh.
3192000	3194000	Oh.
3194000	3196000	Oh.
3196000	3198000	Oh.
3198000	3200000	Oh.
3204000	3206000	Dad.
3206000	3208000	Oh.
3208000	3210000	Come on, baby.
3210000	3212000	My other notes are scaring me.
3222000	3224000	Okay.
3224000	3226000	What?
3226000	3228000	The book just moved?
3228000	3230000	All right.
3230000	3232000	I'm scared.
3236000	3238000	Greetings, visitor.
3238000	3240000	We'd like to take a moment to tell you about
3240000	3242000	our car extender,
3242000	3244000	car extender,
3244000	3246000	warranty.
3250000	3252000	Our wonderful library.
3252000	3254000	A library of
3254000	3256000	books as a state
3256000	3258000	of the art facility.
3258000	3260000	The signs
3260000	3262000	replicate the rural charm found
3262000	3264000	in many older
3264000	3266000	buildings without associated risks.
3266000	3268000	Such buildings are
3268000	3270000	known and accumulate.
3272000	3274000	The building might
3274000	3276000	seem like a strange sight
3276000	3278000	among wall streets.
3278000	3280000	Many towering skyscrapers.
3280000	3282000	But we believe
3282000	3284000	this dichotomy
3284000	3286000	will be
3286000	3288000	what sets us apart.
3288000	3290000	We're glad you've decided
3290000	3292000	to give us a chance
3292000	3294000	and hope that our stock
3294000	3296000	of books will appeal to you.
3296000	3298000	Obviously,
3298000	3300000	our collection of information isn't so vast
3300000	3302000	as to encapsulate

3845760	3873760	I need to find the right key.
3873760	3901760	I need to find the right key.
3901760	3927760	I need to find the right key.
3927760	3940760	We know you've traveled far to arrive here, so please do rest, keep an open mind, read your heart's content, and we'll be sure you're well provided for.
3940760	3963760	One matter note, we ask you not to linger after closing, or to descend too far into the library's vows. Some of our books are quite old and very sensitive to the increase of foreign temperatures and washers.
3963760	3970760	Thank you for understanding.
3970760	3980760	Weird, almost all of the words will cross out, and the pages are stuck together. I can't open this any further.
3980760	4004760	A boros, a circular symbol, a snake swallowing its tail, a representation of the endless cycle of death and rebirth,
4004760	4023760	of wholeness, the infinite, and certain kind of no, this is, this is, this is one of those games. This is one of those games where it's like infinite, infinite rooms, where you go in a circle.
4023760	4034760	Oh no, what have I got myself into? Oh no, this is one of those games.
4035760	4043760	Oh, don't go. Oh, oh, don't go.
4043760	4070760	Oh, and the certain kind of kawaii meaninglessness never puts much stock and mysticism, but in this place it's past pasted all over the goddamn walls.
4070760	4086760	Though to avoid that, last I remember, I was on some occult's website, sitting on the farthest end of the internet, past the places that normally dissuade the less curious.
4086760	4110760	I had just a little too much time in my hands, I remember falling asleep. Now I'm here. No recording said that this place is the library of a borough. Or ro boros. Remember reading something about that, but not what or where.
4110760	4138760	If you're reading this, keep an eye out. Something isn't right. That's the last person who signed the library. It was V.
4138760	4144760	Oh, it's the flies. I got scared for a second.
4144760	4167760	Rest the brass. Rest the brass for the key. Rest the brass. Thanks for visiting Arba. Thanks for visiting. Thanks for visiting. Thanks for coming. You can go now.
4175760	4178760	Can I just go? Can I just leave?
4178760	4195760	How did the mug get all the hair? Wasn't it on the desk?
4209760	4214760	Is it okay to leave? I'm just gonna go.
4219760	4227760	This can't be right. Oh god. Oh god.
4239760	4246760	The game. The game. The game it crashed.
4246760	4271760	It crashed. I hear it's back or back.
4276760	4289760	Hello. We'd like to inform you that the library is now closed. Note that it is unlawful to remain on the premises after closing. This is your one and only warning.
4306760	4335760	I'm so terrified right now. I'm so sorry.
4336760	4351960	I'm so scared.
4351960	4352960	I'm so scared.
4352960	4354720	I don't know why I'm cleaning.
4354720	4356760	Am I stress cleaning right now?
4356760	4358760	Am I stress cleaning?
4359760	4361760	Am I stress cleaning?
4372760	4374760	Oh, man.
4380760	4382760	Oh, man.
4382760	4384760	Oh, this is so scary.
4384760	4396760	So, Mr. Storm, Act 3, Scene 2, Bernice enters while closely by the librarian...
4396760	4400760	I'm, like, stuttering and everything.
4400760	4402760	Oh, my gosh.
4402760	4408760	The librarian, Bernice's breathless, looking both exasperated and slightly excited.
4408760	4413760	The librarian's expression is unreadable.
4413760	4419760	As per usual, Bernice, but my husband will find out about us.
4419760	4420760	Wow.
4420760	4423760	He won't stay out forever.
4423760	4431760	Librarian, I wouldn't be so sure, my dear, but shall we retire to the living room
4431760	4440760	if we're to speak of such unpleasantness as your husband?
4440760	4442760	Yee.
4448760	4452760	Bernice's face breaks suddenly into a grin.
4452760	4457760	She grabs the librarian's hand, taking him onto the couch beside her.
4457760	4460760	Bernice, I'm fine.
4460760	4469760	Then if you are to stay, I want to hear some of those secrets you keep talking about.
4470760	4475760	You can't play with me for the fool forever.
4475760	4481760	Librarian, I would never claim to do such a thing, my dear.
4481760	4489760	Would you care to hear how I can stop a human heart with but a word?
4489760	4491760	Oh.
4491760	4494760	Oh, Bernice.
4494760	4500760	Goodness, that sounds dangerous.
4500760	4506760	Librarian, it most certainly is.
4506760	4509760	I wish to hear it.
4509760	4513760	Then, of course, you shall.
4513760	4519760	He leans close to Bernice, closes her eyes as if expecting a kiss.
4519760	4525760	The librarian leans past her, whispering something into her ear.
4525760	4528760	Bernice's eyes open wide.
4528760	4539760	She gives a single jerk, a strangled groan, and goes limp, sliding off the couch.
4539760	4543760	Eh? Eh?
4543760	4547760	Too curious for her own good.
4547760	4557760	What? What he do? What he do? What he say?
4557760	4569760	He stands, reaching in one of his pockets to withdraw a single black case containing Bernice's wedding ring.
4569760	4579760	Taking a cur-cur-cur-curusary?
4579760	4583760	Curious? Curusary?
4583760	4587760	Cursory? Cursory look around the living room.
4587760	4589760	I've never seen that word before.
4589760	4598760	The librarian eventually focuses on a single point on the opposite side.
4598760	4619760	The librarian crosses the floor, leaves his item, and turns to leave as he does so the scene darkens,
4619760	4623760	leaving only a single spotlight to eliminate the stage.
4623760	4632760	It is fixed on the small black case, which the librarian has decided to leave, sitting on top of the minister's writing desk.
4632760	4637760	What happened? What he do to her?
4637760	4641760	He murdered her? Is she dead?
4641760	4644760	Is she dead?
4644760	4648760	Very early into my profession.
4648760	4658760	Professorship? Professorship? Is that a word?
4658760	4662760	Professorship?
4662760	4673760	A student came to my office one spring afternoon with a stack of papers in her arms.
4673760	4681760	She said, she'd be having strange dreams of a place stretching forward and backwards into infinity,
4681760	4694760	dreams of hallways splitting to hallways, dreams of being lost in the incarnate cuts of some gigantic place that could not possibly exist.
4694760	4697760	On the papers were crude scratches.
4697760	4716760	She was no artist, she said, but something about the dreams had left some vivid impression on her that putting what was in her brain on the page seemed her only option.
4716760	4719760	She was clearly distressed.
4719760	4730760	When I was gently suggested, when I gently just suggested that she visited the university psychologist rather than the resident,
4730760	4741760	ancient history professor, she violently shook her head asking if I knew anything about something called an oral boroughs library,
4741760	4745760	or perhaps a library of oral boroughs.
4745760	4748760	It wasn't entirely clear.
4748760	4762760	I told her the common knowledge about the symbol taken from the Egyptians by the Greeks and from the Greeks by the Middle Europeans,
4762760	4769760	a sign in alchemy of death and rebirth and so forth.
4769760	4778760	The students continued shaking her head all through my explanation until she suddenly cut me off.
4778760	4786760	Oh, this one's long.
4786760	4792760	Those are too old, she said.
4792760	4796760	The place from my dreams was modern.
4796760	4808760	It was electricity, computers, but everything seemed ancient and stink of old dust, damped wood and something else.
4808760	4816760	Please, don't you know of anything in recent times that might have stemmed from that idea?
4816760	4825760	I confessed, but I hadn't, especially considering the size and the many niches of the modern world.
4825760	4832760	She left without another word. They were her drawings by and something about the conversation shook me.
4832760	4846760	I looked through the crude drawings made in a shaky hand and saw in the familiar shapes design an odd air of ominousness.
4846760	4857760	Ominousness.
4857760	4873760	I'm a little bit dyslexic, so I hope you guys can understand.
4873760	4892760	Oh my god.
4892760	4907760	English is so hard.
4907760	4924760	It's like ominousness, like looking at the facade of a dark building and hearing the slightest stretching and things that shouldn't be just behind the stones.
4924760	4946760	All very juvenile thoughts, and yet when I went home that evening, I brought the drawings. I can help but want to look more into what we discuss into that library of arboreals.
4946760	4965760	It was largely fruitless. I found many sites and articles on alchemy, the symbol itself, or the public library in Obros, county, which was located somewhere in the rural Wisconsin.
4966760	4978760	But just as the hour crept past midnight, I found something, the slight snatch of information at the bottom of a rabbit hole series of links.
4978760	4988760	I will not repeat the website's domain or my steps to arrive there for fear that someone might try to replicate what I did.
4988760	5007760	But I will repeat what I found, because just as that student couldn't get the ideas from her head without drawing, I find I can't think of anything else, waking or sleeping.
5008760	5022760	I hope those will help. The library of arboreals, a kind of waking nightmare, arrived upon by those too curious for their own good.
5023760	5038760	Rich in the black secrets, rich in the dark ideas lost to time, rich in languages from dead races on other planets.
5039760	5059760	The fortunate die. The truly lucky, or perhaps the most unfortunate of all, become tenders for all time, knowing far more than any living being could ever hope to learn without becoming a permanent,
5060760	5066760	prematurely screaming stain on the face of space's time forever.
5070760	5077760	This is so scary. Why is reading this even more scary than actually playing the game?
5079760	5085760	Though we are actually playing the game. There's a lot of reading, and I don't mind it.
5089760	5093760	It helps me distract myself from the game itself.
5098760	5102760	None have left. It's unscathed.
5103760	5120760	There are forbidden tunes on that will that would prevent you from breathing, so to merely touch them, and the tenders are beyond sanity and jealously kept their terrible secrets.
5121760	5126760	We've searched enough, and this is your final warning.
5127760	5141760	That night I slept fitfully, my dreams beset by images of dark, dusty plays eerie for its supposed normalcy.
5142760	5149760	I could almost feel things passing by, just beneath the floorboards within the walls, watching me.
5150760	5163760	Every exit led to another room, nearly the same as the one before it, and out the window I saw only black.
5164760	5177760	My dreams have been consistently disturbed since that night, so much so that it is hard for me to teach, so heavily preoccupied is my waking mind.
5178760	5187760	Waking mind, I hope this writing will be enough for my mind to use one last thing.
5188760	5194760	I've since tried to find the student who first contacted me to tell her what I learned.
5195760	5202760	My hope was that I might be able to put her mind at ease, or at least commiserate with her.
5203760	5205760	But I haven't been able to find her.
5206760	5213760	In fact, since the day she visited my office, her roommates haven't seen her, nor has anyone else.
5214760	5216760	And I fear I might be next.
5222760	5224760	I'm so scared to turn around.
5226760	5228760	It's so scary to turn around.
5228760	5242760	The note is largely obscured by blood. You can make out only a handful of words.
5243760	5254760	And one of the dustier books fell apart in my hands. There were these arcane scribbles, feels. I've tried to read away, but it's still not quite right.
5255760	5257760	Like something watching.
5271760	5279760	The vent bolted in pretty tight. I don't see myself tearing this out with bare hands anytime soon.
5279760	5290760	What's that? More garbage? More trash?
5292760	5298760	I don't know, I feel this urge to clean, like it will make everything better.
5299760	5303760	I gotta be less scared if I just clean.
5310760	5312760	It's locked.
5325760	5327760	Oh no, I missed the garbage can.
5333760	5335760	Can I not pick that up?
5340760	5345760	What the fuck is?
5349760	5350760	What is that?
5351760	5352760	What is that?
5354760	5355760	Am I okay?
5356760	5357760	Am I okay?
5369760	5373760	Is this a screwdriver?
5400760	5402760	If I like get cookies, if I like clean up the library?
5404760	5413560	It's gone! It's gone, it's gone.
5417760	5422760	No, no no, no.
5422760	5439520	No. No. No. No. No, no. No. No. No, no, no. No. No. No. Carine. No. No. No. It's just

5852100	5858580	black knowledge slithered it's away from those stained pages and into my brain
5858580	5866780	and now it grips my eyelids forcing them wide the diner sideways I'm like this
5866780	5875620	for a few minutes then there is someone else standing sideways in front of me that man

5939180	5946180	there's a flicker of feeling of warm thing that cuts through the fog that's
5946180	5952780	wallowed up my head for days as he withdraws his hand I see a strip of ragged
5953020	5960860	flesh in it which he brings to his face when he lifts his hand again the flesh is gone

6022260	6031740	of red there's feeling the tiredness becomes more pronounced he doesn't ask
6031740	6037820	anymore just takes each time his hands come down a little part of me leaves but

7512380	7527380	Well apparently my doctor told me that caffeine is really good for putting people with ADHD to sleep
7527380	7536380	and helping them like focus for like a small bit but usually instead of a crash you get tired
7537380	7547380	and this is more common with people with ADHD so I was recommended to drink a lot of caffeine
7547380	7554980	so I have well I have I have red bull I have some caffeine tea or is it yeah I've
7554980	7572980	caffeinated tea and coffee have a lot of caffeine stuff
7602980	7615980	blueberry red bull the heck is that that sounds horrible
7615980	7636980	it goes hard down now I have to try it down it only took one person to say it tastes good
7636980	7644980	I thought everyone was gonna be like yeah yeah don't drink that now I have to try it
7666980	7685980	the snuggers is so sticky oh it's so sticky

7806980	7812980	like don't get me wrong I like chocolate my favorite kind of chocolate is milk chocolate
7812980	7819980	but I don't like dark chocolate at all I really don't like bitter things
7819980	7848980	I'm a quietist I hear dark chocolate is healthy for healthier for your skin
7848980	7861980	though I tried it to eat dark chocolate there's only so many brands I can eat
7861980	7873980	and too much chocolate on my some of my foods is a bit much my favorite flavors
7873980	7880980	are strawberry and vanilla so if especially if it's ice cream related strawberry and vanilla
7880980	7888980	I do like chocolate ice cream I do sometimes I hate it but I wouldn't it wouldn't be my go-to
7888980	7906980	cacao yeah I like cacao I like white chocolate too it's good

9266300	9269300	Don't make the promise.
9269300	9273300	Pull pink.
9273300	9280300	Pinkie, pinkie, pinkie, pinkie, pinkie, from love.
9280300	9289300	I'm very rubbing my own tummy.
9289300	9297300	I don't like tummy.
9297300	9301300	It doesn't really help.
9301300	9305300	Not all the time.
9305300	9309300	Cookies, chocolate, bread bowl.
9309300	9314300	That's what I'm going to eat today.
9314300	9317300	It's the best meal.
9317300	9320300	The only meal I eat today.
9320300	9322300	Cookies, chocolate, and bread bowl.
9322300	9327300	I'm going to eat some bread.
9327300	9347300	My finger.
9347300	9362300	I have a lot of bread bowl and water.
9362300	9374300	I have to drink water because my kidney has been having issues lately.
9374300	9378300	I have tons of water.
9378300	9384300	What's 24?
9384300	9386300	24.
9386300	9388300	I'm doing math.
9388300	9390300	48.
9390300	9394300	48 water is sitting right here next to me.
9394300	9399300	I drunk all 24 in the span of a week.
9399300	9402300	I have a ton of water next to me.
9402300	9416300	Water is very important in my diet.
9416300	9418300	Basically a four course meal.
9418300	9421300	It's true.
9421300	9430300	Alright, mama's okay.
9430300	9438300	I'm going to put anything between the bread to make a sandwich.
9438300	9444300	I have male nails.
9444300	9449300	I can't have male nails that make my stomach hurt.
9449300	9459300	It makes me go bleh at the same time.
9459300	9463300	I can't eat male nails.
9463300	9471300	Have you ever been like, this is a poor person's story.
9471300	9476300	I've ever been so broke.
9476300	9482300	What was your brokeest food you ever ate?
9482300	9485300	Mine was bread and mayo.
9485300	9506300	I would take mayo, put it on a slice of bread and eat that.
9506300	9511300	Sleep. Relatable.
9511300	9519300	So relatable.
9519300	9535300	I'm so funny.
9535300	9537300	You see bread mayo because you liked it.
9537300	9540300	I ended up liking it afterwards.
9540300	9544300	But it was definitely just broke person food at the time.
9544300	9551300	It was literally all I could eat.
9551300	9554300	Where I used to live, we had mice.
9554300	9560300	So a lot of our food wasn't really good to eat.
9560300	9563300	We had the big ol' micey micey.
9563300	9566300	Small, really small, tiny micey micey.
9566300	9568300	Air.
9568300	9570300	Jam sandwich.
9570300	9573300	Spam in the dollar store.
9573300	9587300	A squid of mustard to get some kick.
9587300	9590300	Gold Caesar salad, isn't that dangerous?
9590300	9595300	I heard people got really ill from eating old salad.
9595300	9597300	Sounds dangerous.
9597300	9599300	Careful.
9599300	9607300	I read in sauce and stories, some crazy stories about the most innocent food murdering people.
9607300	9611300	Potatoes.
9611300	9615300	You guys heard about the potatoes?
9615300	9624300	This is getting dark fast.
9624300	9626300	I actually can't eat ramen.
9626300	9628300	Packaged ramen.
9628300	9633300	My stomach can't digest the noodles for some reason.
9633300	9635300	Processed noodles.
9635300	9642300	Whatever they're putting in the noodles and packaged ramen, my stomach can't digest it.
9642300	9653300	So like 5 to 10 minutes after eating it, it comes back up really fast.
9653300	9658300	It comes all back up right away.
9658300	9662300	I can have ramen, unfortunately, unless it's freshly made.
9662300	9666300	Freshly made ramen.
9666300	9668300	Very very fresh.
9668300	9671300	I have a favorite ramen spot that I go to.
9671300	9673300	I can't go often because it's really far away from me.
9673300	9677300	And I can't really travel far because of my health.
9677300	9680300	So if I'm feeling really good, I go there.
9680300	9684300	It's my favorite place.
9684300	9687300	And I'll eat there because it's homemade.
9687300	9689300	Scratch. Ramen made out of scratch.
9689300	9690300	From scratch.
9690300	9692300	And it's really really good.
9699300	9703300	When you're so broke, you look for things to smell to fill you up.
9703300	9706300	Bro!
9706300	9708300	I get you.
9714300	9716300	Bro.
9716300	9719300	I understand.
9719300	9722300	Bro, I understand it, but I understand you.
9729300	9731300	Bro, I get you.
9736300	9740300	Water in Cheerios is crazy!
9740300	9742300	No!
9742300	9745300	Water in Cheerios!
9746300	9748300	No!
9764300	9766300	Yeah, I can't travel far because of my health.
9766300	9769300	That is indeed what I said.
9769300	9779300	So when I feel really really good and I take all my meds and I'm feeling really great,
9779300	9781300	and I can go far, I do.
9781300	9783300	And I go even further.
9783300	9785300	Even further than that.
9785300	9788300	But I get really tired really fast.
9788300	9793300	And because the medication I'm on makes me sleepy,
9793300	9802300	I end up falling asleep in public on public transportation and stuff.
9802300	9804300	So I go.
9811300	9815300	I get really really really exhausted easy and then my back starts hurting,
9815300	9817300	my legs and my arms.
9817300	9819300	And I'm like, I gotta sit down.
9819300	9820300	I have to sit down.
9820300	9823300	I can't walk anymore.
9824300	9827300	I have to sit down.
9827300	9830300	So I end up like sitting and stuff.
9836300	9838300	I have to...
9847300	9849300	I have to sit down.
9853300	9855300	My little brothers are like,
9855300	9859300	ah, two guys talking about how poor they were growing up.
9859300	9862300	We ate the fruit off the wallpaper.
9862300	9865300	No way!
9865300	9870300	And I'm mad, I know what fruit wallpaper they're talking about.
9873300	9875300	How do I know that?
9875300	9879300	My grandma used to have the...
9879300	9885300	She used to put wallpaper on her cabinets.
9885300	9890300	Her cabinets used to have the fruit wallpaper,
9890300	9892300	usually on the inside, on the floor of it,
9892300	9895300	or like somewhere in the kitchen.
9895300	9897300	When grandma comes,
9897300	9899300	rum rum.
9919300	9921300	Hope I'll be less broke now.
9921300	9923300	Me too.
9923300	9925300	Me too.
9928300	9935300	And then I'll be able to finally give my own place.
9935300	9939300	I still live with my family.
9939300	9942300	There's quite a lot of them here.
9942300	9945300	This place is really small, very loud.
9945300	9950300	I can't really do my ASMRs for you guys properly.
9950300	9954300	So I hope you guys understand about the quality
9954300	9957300	of some of my ASMRs
9957300	9963300	and the quality of some of my, uh...
9963300	9965300	things.
9965300	9967300	I, uh...
9967300	9969300	Unfortunately...
9969300	9971300	I'm sorry.
9971300	9973300	Voice crack.
9973300	9976300	Unfortunately, be, uh...
9976300	9981300	careful when it comes to sounds and stuff.
9981300	9984300	My chat froze again.
9987300	9991300	And I think...
9993300	9995300	I think it's back?
9995300	9997300	Oh, it's back.
10012300	10015300	You'll like it your country, huh?
10015300	10019300	I mean, being my age
10019300	10023300	and still being, you know, here
10023300	10026300	makes me feel a little down.
10026300	10030300	But I understand, given, um...
10030300	10034300	the generation is smart
10034300	10038300	to stay with your parents anyways.
10038300	10040300	But I, I can't...
10040300	10043300	I cannot take it much longer.
10045300	10048300	Okay, I have, like, no freedom.
10048300	10051300	No freedom to do what you want.
10053300	10055300	Can't even walk around my own...
10055300	10057300	my, um, the house
10057300	10059300	or my own room.
10059300	10063300	Uh, Nicky, a majority of the time.
10063300	10065300	Can't even do that.
10065300	10067300	It's not fair.
10067300	10070300	I have to worry about people just opening my door.
10070300	10072300	Hello?
10074300	10077300	Aw, man, come on.
10078300	10081300	Let me be free.
10082300	10084300	Nicky.
10096300	10098300	Does the merch go directly to you
10098300	10100300	or to Valor, Valor?
10100300	10102300	Uh, directly to me.
10102300	10105300	I get 100% a merch.
10106300	10110300	Directly to me, yeah.
10116300	10118300	It's, uh, my heart.
10118300	10121300	Uh, it's doing, uh,
10121300	10124300	loop-de-loops right now.
10124300	10126300	It's almost time for me
10126300	10129300	to take my medication, I believe, I think.
10129300	10132300	I'm not really paying attention to the time.
10133300	10137300	I was supposed to be reading you guys a story,
10137300	10142300	but I'm just fiving here with you guys.
10147300	10149300	You sure it's not the Red Bull?
10149300	10151300	I haven't drunk any yet.
10151300	10153300	I only mentioned that I have Red Bull,
10153300	10156300	but I haven't drunk any yet.
10156300	10158300	I have Red Bull yet.
10158300	10160300	Not yet.
10160300	10163300	I'm just thinking about it, but not yet.
10168300	10170300	Please don't go.
10170300	10172300	I'm not going anywhere yet.
10175300	10177300	Not yet, not yet.
10177300	10179300	A lot of yet-yets.
10179300	10181300	Not yet.
10182300	10185300	I'll be around for a while.
10191300	10193300	You're enjoying the chit chat?
10193300	10195300	You already got your hoodie?
10195300	10197300	Well, thank you.
10197300	10200300	I'm glad you could say, where's the hoodie?
10202300	10206300	Eventually, you'll even get the sweatpants, too, to match.
10221300	10225300	You was trying to tip on stream elements,
10225300	10227300	and I won't let you.
10227300	10230300	I am not really sure
10230300	10233300	what their issue there is.
10245300	10247300	Hmm.
10250300	10252300	Hmm.
10252300	10254300	Hmm.
10254300	10256300	Hmm.
10278300	10280300	Can you have a pat?
10280300	10282300	Sure you can.
10282300	10284300	Good boy.
10284300	10286300	Good girl.
10287300	10289300	Here you go.
10291300	10293300	Wanna have a pat too?
10293300	10295300	Wanna hug, too?
10295300	10297300	I'll give you a hug.
10300300	10302300	Hmm.
10302300	10304300	You like that?
10304300	10306300	Hmm. Here you go.
10306300	10308300	Nice hug.
10308300	10312300	There you go. Nice hug.
10326300	10332300	Trani said, uh, was saying that some girls had paper restricted because it was coming in so fast.
10332300	10336300	Most likely, yes, I think that's what I remember as well.
10336300	10340300	That's probably the case.
10344300	10348300	Chad is greedy. No, Chad is a cutie.
10348300	10352300	That's what mommy is here for.
10352300	10356300	Chad wants hugs. Chad wants cuddles.
10356300	10360300	Chad wants kisses.
10360300	10364300	I don't want to get hit by YouTube.
10378300	10382300	It's gonna be a thing, isn't it? Just hashtag no pants gang.
10382300	10386300	True. I'm not wearing pants either.
10390300	10394300	Who wears pants? Who needs pants?
10394300	10398300	Surely not me.
10420300	10424300	There's someone who doesn't like it when they don't wear pants.
10424300	10428300	You're so lucky.
10428300	10432300	I was just out of space with my own.
10432300	10436300	No pants, no nothing.
10436300	10440300	With an AC.
10440300	10444300	I get it though.
10452300	10456300	Pants shouldn't even exist. I don't even know why clothes exist.
10456300	10460300	It's so uncomfy.
10460300	10464300	Does anyone else get a little overstimulated when they wear clothes?
10464300	10468300	Like, do you ever get this feeling when clothes rub against your skin?
10468300	10472300	And it feels like some sort of like burning sensation?
10478300	10482300	Over-stimulated.
10488300	10492300	Clothes exist so you won't get banned on YouTube.
10492300	10496300	True. True.
10496300	10500300	It's like not really like a burning burning,
10500300	10504300	not like a real burning, but like a
10504300	10508300	strange tingling sensation
10508300	10512300	that gets intensified on your skin
10512300	10516300	when certain material rubs against your skin
10516300	10520300	for a really long period of time. It's like an extreme tingling.
10526300	10530300	I get that.
10530300	10534300	I get overstimulated so I don't like wearing clothes.
10534300	10538300	Then I'm gonna rip it off.
10538300	10542300	Get it off me! Get this off me!
10556300	10560300	Get it off me!
10580300	10584300	And sometimes the heat doesn't make it any better.
10584300	10588300	Imagine being like, imagine getting that tingling feeling
10588300	10592300	and feeling hot and sweaty.
10592300	10596300	I hate it.
10614300	10618300	I love the cold air.
10618300	10622300	I love cold air.
10622300	10626300	My favorite season needs to be spring
10626300	10630300	but because spring doesn't
10630300	10634300	last very long where I am,
10634300	10638300	I don't think spring is going to last that long.
10638300	10642300	I don't think spring is going to last that long.
10642300	10646300	Spring lasts very long where I am.
10646300	10650300	Spring disappears in like a month or two
10650300	10654300	because spring doesn't last very long. Fall has kind of become
10654300	10658300	the stand-in since fall does kind of last
10658300	10662300	a little longer until it starts snowing.
10662300	10666300	Spring and fall are my favorite seasons.
10666300	10670300	I really like the smell of flowers
10670300	10674300	and the plants growing and stuff.
10674300	10678300	Everything's sprouting. I like it walking by.
10686300	10690300	What time do I shower at?
10690300	10694300	At the hottest. Like boiling.
10694300	10698300	If you were a normal human or to put their hand
10698300	10702300	in the water, it would burn you.
10702300	10706300	I shower at excruciatingly hot
10706300	10710300	hot water. I don't know why but when I feel
10710300	10714300	lukewarm water on me while I'm showering,
10714300	10718300	I lose it. I don't know. It's not hot enough. It's not hot enough.
10718300	10722300	I have to turn it up a little more. It's not hot enough. More. It's not hot enough.
10722300	10726300	More. And then it goes all the way at the end
10726300	10730300	and sometimes it's still not hot enough.
10740300	10744300	I gotta be careful though sometimes because
10744300	10748300	the play...
10752300	10756300	Sarah just scared me so bad. It's medication time.
10760300	10764300	My poor heart.
10774300	10778300	Let me grow my plants.
10786300	10790300	They're fine.
10790300	10794300	But yeah. I gotta be careful sometimes.
10794300	10798300	The hot water can get excruciatingly hot.
10798300	10802300	It's never the same temperature every time you use it.
10802300	10806300	So sometimes I guess the boiler
10806300	10810300	is doing really good for one night
10810300	10814300	and
10814300	10818300	it'd be really bad.
10822300	10826300	Sometimes it does burn me right away. That's why you gotta start in the center.
10826300	10830300	You gotta start warm and then turn it up slowly.
10832300	10836300	Okay.
10840300	10844300	I don't know where my water went.
10844300	10848300	I got it.
10848300	10852300	Yeah.
10862300	10866300	Sorry about that.
10866300	10870300	Hard on me to hear that at all.
10892300	10896300	I can't...
10896300	10900300	I can't...
10908300	10912300	I really don't think
10912300	10916300	V2P Studio likes me...
10916300	10920300	I really don't think V2P Studio likes me very much.
10920300	10939500	very much. Is that asthma medication I hear? It is. It is. I have everything wrong with
10939500	10944140	me. I check the full bingo book. I did bingo five times.
11000460	11000940	Hi.
11010300	11011580	You guys are so cute.
11018700	11023980	I'm putting on my cream from my spine and my shoulder.
11026220	11027020	It's all wet.
11030300	11035100	It's almost super wet.
11037900	11038300	Wow.
11060380	11075260	It's so creamy. It's like weird white, like
11077500	11086620	kind of milky, but it's like kind of clear, but slightly white. Cream looks weird.
11089740	11090220	It's,
11117340	11117820	It's
11119500	11136620	Are you the type to sleep in the cold with a blanket or the type to not wear it and be
11136620	11140620	woken in the middle of the night?
11140620	11151660	If it's really cold out I'd wear like three blankets because it gets really really cold here like super super cold
11151660	11169340	So three blankets, lots and lots of blankets
11182620	11192620	Honestly it's very... during the year of nurturing a passionate person just by the things you have to deal with
11192620	11199260	I appreciate that so so very much thank you thank you so much
11199340	11207660	It's very kind of you to say I I like to think that being positive uh
11209100	11217740	being staying positive keeps the energy high and keeps you at peace uh at peace of mind when you
11217740	11226780	know you're uh if you are sad all the time you feel kind of bad a lot of the time so being positive
11227740	11236460	wanting to keep the vibes high and not wanting to be you know sad all the time really helps
11238620	11246460	with that so I don't want to be that person so I do my very best when it comes to that
11257500	11266460	um
11266460	11296260	Okay, yeah, so I understand being sad though.
11296980	11301940	It cannot be helped. I have my days too. I'm sure everyone does too,
11302580	11312340	but they feel absolutely lonely or really sad and down and that's why I resonate with people
11312340	11323060	like that and I've felt that feeling of extreme loneliness before and I don't like it. So it's
11323060	11331140	kind of one of the reasons why I wanted to be a vtuber from the very beginning. I always thought
11331140	11336900	it was something nice, but even before that, just a streamer period, I wanted to
11339460	11341620	build a community of people who are like me,
11342340	11354340	people who need a place, people who need someone to talk to, someone to keep them company when
11354340	11361220	they are down and sad. So I always wanted to be someone like that for other people because I
11361220	11368900	didn't want no one to ever feel or felt, feel like how I felt in the past. Oh god, I'm such an emotional
11368900	11384820	person. What's wrong with me? I am like hanging on by a thread.
11398980	11405220	And it's very, very, very, very, very much okay to be sad. It's okay to feel the way you feel
11405220	11412340	because it's easier to get through your emotions and understand them so that you feel better
11412340	11418260	about everything else as long as you understand how you feel and how you are and the way
11418580	11434740	as an overall and then you'd know and you can move past it. You accept it and you move past it
11435380	11440420	and there's always going to be some things you can never get over. There are some things I don't
11440420	11449780	think I could never get over so I understand. It's already been six months since I lost my
11450660	11464980	fur baby and I think about him every day. I think about him every single day.
11465620	11469540	Yeah.
11480740	11484580	I have pictures of him if you guys ever want to see him one day.
11484740	11493140	I have some pictures and I hold the air.
11507860	11510180	I can always post them later, later on, okay?
11510340	11516500	I'm sorry to anyone who has also lost
11519940	11530740	a friend, not to say a friend or a family because he was my family. It was my friend.
11540580	11561140	So, baby, I'm going to
11561620	11566900	I'm probably going to one day ask you guys to show me your pets.
11568980	11576180	So, I'm prepared. I do love seeing everyone else's pets and it doesn't matter what kind of pet you
11576180	11587300	have. Cat, dog, goat, horse, pet chickens, spider,
11591540	11596740	axolotl fishes, any kind of fish, even a dangerous kind.
11596820	11602340	I love them dearly.
11605140	11606740	Life is amazing.
11614820	11615940	I think they're all cute.
11618500	11626500	They're your little friend. They're cute. I think snakes are really, really cute.
11626820	11632900	So, yeah, adorable little snoops and then a little tongue-tickle.
11646580	11647300	I love it.
11647300	11657700	I used to have a cat that knew how to turn on the faucet.
11659220	11662900	He really liked water and he would sit in it.
11665620	11668820	He'd always ask for a bath. I miss him too.
11669540	11679940	I had quite a lot of pets when I was growing up. I had a big heart for pets. Even had a pet pigeon.
11684020	11689540	One of my family members saved it during a storm. Its entire nest had fallen.
11690180	11696260	The others were unfortunately unable to be saved. They saved a little baby pigeon.
11697060	11698660	The other pet pigeon for a while.
11702420	11707140	We didn't really get a chance to give it a name because we weren't going to keep it.
11708260	11709700	This was a long time ago though.
11714660	11723700	I've had parrots. I've had five cats. I think we had two. We had two cats that we thought one was a
11724660	11733780	girl but turned out to be a boy. He had a little peepee.
11735620	11742500	It was a little peepee and we couldn't tell. It was a little peepee.
11746340	11747380	It was very cute.
11754100	11758420	He was my favorite. He was my favorite kitty.
11766180	11771300	We found out. We found out he was a boy when he got older.
11771780	11789220	Unfortunately we couldn't change his name. He had a name for years and we didn't know.
11791380	11793140	He had a name for years.
11795780	11797140	So he had a girly name.
11801700	11806740	He had a girly name. His name was Mimi.
11810740	11819220	His name was Mimi.
11831300	11848100	He had gimme pigs growing up. I knew someone who had a bunch of gimme pigs.
11851860	11857620	They had so many that they had to leave their apartment door open.
11857860	11865300	They had to leave it open and put a pin outside the door.
11866740	11882420	The gimme pigs were massive. They were huge. They had four of them.
11887620	11897620	I had a tuxedo cat.
11898580	11907620	We found out it was a male.
11918740	11921700	He made me feel so used to their name. We couldn't really change it.
11922580	11926020	They responded to the name. Imagine changing their name
11926020	11928100	as they got older. They would have been so confused.
11928260	11936100	It's not my name.
11936100	11962100	We kept the other people and let them run around the living room every once in a while to get
11962100	11966100	their exercise done. It's so cute. It's so cute.
11969380	11978100	I like that. I like that a lot.
11978100	11998100	Unfortunately, I don't live in a place where we can have outside pets.
11999060	12002580	I don't live in a place where that's possible.
12005860	12007780	So they endure, endure only.
12010260	12018100	A lot of harm outside. Endure, endure only.
12028100	12053060	I'm sorry. I'm quiet. I'm just reading what you guys are saying.
12053060	12058020	You guys bring a big smile to my face or hair.
12058020	12066980	I'm going to undercap the goblin king.
12066980	12075940	I thought we said jarred.
12097940	12103940	Don't eat rocks, please.
12103940	12109940	It's not good for you. It's not good for your tummy.
12109940	12130900	I had two birds a long time ago named Red and Wilma. That's cute.
12133380	12139620	Surprisingly, Mimi wasn't a big cat. Mimi looked very feminine.
12139620	12145780	Even when he got older, he was like the runt of his litter. He was very, very small.
12145780	12150580	He was tiny. And as he got older, he was extremely small then.
12150580	12171540	So he looked a lot like a female cat.
12171700	12180980	All right. I think it's time.
12185140	12193460	I can read. I was going to read your story, but we were vibing so hard.
12193620	12209380	And I, myself, am getting really sleepy. We can always save the story for another time.
12211940	12221380	Yeah, we all forgot, huh? We all forgot about the story.
12223460	12250500	That's probably going to be a lot of a majority of these streams where we derail quite a lot.
12250980	12258260	But it's fine if the vibes are right. I don't mind this. It's fun.
12265140	12269140	I love chatting with you guys and reading what you'll have to say.
12269940	12274340	That hurt mine.
12278820	12286100	Yeah, there was supposed to be a story time, but it was decided because of the game
12287780	12298580	crashing me. But I do want to start getting ready for bed. My medication does make me extremely tired,
12298580	12304900	so I'm like hanging in there now. My medication makes me really sleepy.
12313060	12322740	Yeah, I'm on a raid of Mercy. I will go say hi. Let's prepare to raid Mercy.
12329300	12340820	And then whoever is going to bed, please get rest. Everyone deserves to feel rested and feel good.
12342900	12343300	Sorry.
12343300	12358020	Okay, let me make sure I have this.
12365860	12368020	Oh, dang.
12373300	12380020	Oh, dang.
12388100	12390020	Okay.
12398820	12402020	Ok.
12403300	12417940	Marcy is doing killer, killer 7. I think she's playing killer 7. So let's all say hi.
12417940	12437460	Bleeding Raid. Bleeding Raid. Thank you. I'll miss you. I'll miss you too. I'll see you guys.
12438100	12448020	Right. So I won't be streaming tomorrow. I'm gonna get some rest. Usually I don't stream
12448900	12455940	on um yeah for Gorn Raid. Usually I don't stream on Mondays and Tuesdays.
12456660	12466180	So today was an exception because I have doctor's appointments every week and Monday and Tuesday
12466180	12477300	are the days that I go to doctors. So and I can try and squeeze streams in on either day
12478020	12483300	but this is a high chance that I'll have an appointment that I would need to go to.
12484420	12490900	Usually they're in the noon and then I come I gotta come home and then I can stream
12491300	12501700	uh right after but because I'm on like heavy medication um I'm usually really tired before
12501700	12518900	the stream um so yeah there's that and uh I feel like there was something else that I completely
12519060	12530980	forgot to mention. My brain is not there right now. Oh yeah um I'm sure you guys saw the tags.
12531540	12540820	I posted our tags on Twitter um I completely forgot about our general tag so everyone got
