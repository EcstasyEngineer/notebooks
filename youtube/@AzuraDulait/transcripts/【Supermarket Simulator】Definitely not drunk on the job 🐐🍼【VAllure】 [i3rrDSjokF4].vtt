22:20.020 --> 22:20.560
now

22:20.560 --> 22:21.500
Now

22:21.500 --> 22:22.460
now

22:22.460 --> 22:23.500
now

22:23.500 --> 22:35.660
I've had some vegan food. Vegan food isn't too bad. There was like these like meatballs

22:35.660 --> 22:41.660
that weren't really meat and I don't know what it was made out of and I ate it and it

22:41.660 --> 22:57.580
was so good. I don't remember. It was like whole foods I think. It was very yummy. It

22:57.580 --> 23:05.660
was super yummy. I didn't even know it was vegan. I just picked it up and I ate it.

23:11.660 --> 23:23.100
That was crazy.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.100
hmm

23:34.620 --> 23:40.540
Adora is via lawyers most intellectuals from that's right

23:41.180 --> 23:48.520
That's right. I'm the most intellectuals we're here. I know everything is to know about anything

23:49.580 --> 23:51.580
I'm intelligent. Mm-hmm

23:53.340 --> 23:55.340
hmm

24:07.260 --> 24:09.260
Mm

24:11.180 --> 24:15.740
There's no nine of our line and we need a record with the jukebox. I'm here with you, Lele

24:23.100 --> 24:28.080
I was a little bit late to stream though.

24:28.080 --> 24:31.020
I had to pee pee.

24:31.020 --> 24:40.540
If I came all of a sudden I had to go.

24:40.540 --> 24:45.260
Um, actually.

24:45.260 --> 24:55.780
Could have been artificial meat maybe, but it was the lesses.

24:55.780 --> 24:58.420
I don't care what it was.

24:58.420 --> 25:02.620
Give me more of that and just don't tell me what it was because if you tell me it was

25:02.620 --> 25:19.980
something crazy I'll probably be sick to my stomach.

25:19.980 --> 25:39.420
Still better than Taco Bell meat?

25:39.420 --> 25:43.980
You know, I had Taco Bell for the first time in like 5 years.

25:43.980 --> 25:46.540
It was actually pretty good.

25:47.260 --> 25:53.900
I had Taco Bell so long because I used to really fuck my stomach.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.420
Really bad.

25:55.420 --> 26:02.620
I destroyed my stomach, but I had it recently.

26:02.620 --> 26:04.460
It was good.

26:04.460 --> 26:09.020
It was really good, but I couldn't finish that quesadilla.

26:09.100 --> 26:14.300
It was uh, too much.

26:14.300 --> 26:15.980
Too much.

26:15.980 --> 26:21.100
Too much my stomach, not until it.

26:21.100 --> 26:24.060
I'm a big fan of soft tacos though.

26:24.060 --> 26:26.060
I like a soft taco.

26:26.060 --> 26:32.060
I'm traumatized by a hard taco because I remember biting into one and then like the shell like

26:32.140 --> 26:34.300
shanked my gum.

26:39.340 --> 26:46.700
I remember being in so much pain and I was like nah, I'm not eating a hard taco again.

26:47.820 --> 26:49.420
It's horrible.

26:49.420 --> 26:57.260
I have a bad experience.

27:10.620 --> 27:11.900
It's true, I think so.

27:11.900 --> 27:12.780
I believe so.

27:13.500 --> 27:20.860
Oh my gosh, that reminds me of when I got food poisoning from Mickey D.

27:22.620 --> 27:26.620
I had heavy food poisoning, twice.

27:26.860 --> 27:46.300
I haven't eaten anything really, but this like chicken.

27:48.060 --> 27:50.380
Hey, just like two pieces of chicken.

27:50.380 --> 27:52.940
That was all I had today, nothing else.

27:54.780 --> 27:55.660
And there's icy.

27:56.780 --> 27:57.260

28:06.860 --> 28:07.660

28:11.340 --> 28:12.860
I'm all out of bread.

28:14.940 --> 28:16.860
Only bread I have is this one right here.

28:18.060 --> 28:18.540

28:20.940 --> 28:21.580
One double.

28:27.180 --> 28:29.900
Oh, can't reach it.

28:30.780 --> 28:31.580
That's too far.

28:39.740 --> 28:40.460
Yeah, twice.

28:40.460 --> 28:42.380
I got food poisoning at Mickey D.

28:43.820 --> 28:49.660
I ate 20 pieces of chicken nuggets, chicken nuggets.

28:50.380 --> 28:55.500
I ate 20 pieces and the other time I had a 40 piece.

28:57.020 --> 28:59.340
And then I got sick.

29:00.060 --> 29:09.980
I went to bed and I was laying on the floor because I couldn't lay on the sofa at the time

29:09.980 --> 29:11.260
because I didn't have the actual bed.

29:11.260 --> 29:12.060
I had a sofa.

29:15.820 --> 29:22.300
A family member was staying over so they took my sofa and they kept kicking me so I laid on the

29:22.300 --> 29:22.940
floor.

29:22.940 --> 29:30.140
I was on the floor and I was sleeping and then all of a sudden my stomach was hurting.

29:30.140 --> 29:32.300
It woke me up, but I couldn't move.

29:32.300 --> 29:33.740
I was like paralyzed.

29:33.740 --> 29:34.380
I couldn't move.

29:34.380 --> 29:35.420
I couldn't get up.

29:35.420 --> 29:36.140
I was laying there.

29:41.420 --> 29:50.140
I was on my stomach and I woke up and I was like my head up and I was like,

29:50.220 --> 29:52.300
whoa, I can't, I can't move.

29:52.300 --> 29:53.580
I gotta go to the bathroom.

29:53.580 --> 29:55.420
I can't, I can't move.

29:55.420 --> 29:59.580
And I was like, and I almost like choked.

30:00.300 --> 30:03.660
I had to turn over to the side, like as hard as I could.

30:03.660 --> 30:06.460
I had to force myself to turn to the side and I was just like,

30:12.780 --> 30:13.660
it wouldn't stop.

30:15.740 --> 30:16.540
It was horrible.

30:20.620 --> 30:34.460
And then after that, I didn't have Mickey D's for like three years and then I had it again later on.

30:37.820 --> 30:38.940
Everyone was eating it.

30:39.820 --> 30:42.380
It was the only thing I could afford at the time.

30:42.380 --> 30:48.540
They're not when they still have the dollar menus.

30:52.540 --> 30:53.900
Yeah, no other choice.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.460

30:56.460 --> 30:57.660

31:12.540 --> 31:14.540
Mmm.

31:23.980 --> 31:25.740

31:27.340 --> 31:30.300

31:34.460 --> 31:40.540

You know my favorite part of a sigh, you know you know when you know long stockings

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:17.620
You know when they're like really tight and they got that little plump

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.540
Little plump to it

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:16.340

01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:23.060

I have no clue why that popped into my head, but about into my head

01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:24.580
What did I pop into my head?

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:31.740
The period about the taxes

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.140
He taxes

01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:52.740

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:56.740
Who doesn't like taxes?

01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:58.740
Two taxes, stupid.

01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.740
Stupid taxes.

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:02.740
I hate taxes.

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:12.740
You're welcome, Forgotten Memories.

01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:14.740
You're gonna experience that a lot here.

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:16.740
Two breads.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.740
Sure.

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:20.740
I'll see you.

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.740

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:30.740
Have a nice day.

01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:32.740
So a big boy.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.740
A big boy.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.740
Big boy.

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:38.740
Massive boy.

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.740
But no matter how big you are,

01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.740
you'll always be a big boy.

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:50.740
But no matter how big you are,

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:54.740
you'll always be small to me.

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.740
Wow.

01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:06.740
You have nice hair.

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:08.740
It's kind of like doing a little

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.740
light show for me.

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:12.740
Kind of.

01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:22.740
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t.

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.740
I'm sorry.

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:28.740
My apologies.

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.740
Ooh, a whole white suit.

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:36.740
Brass fancy.

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:38.740
Fancy.

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:44.740
Oh.

01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:50.740
Fancy two breads.

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:52.740
I like them when they get two breads.

01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:54.740
You know, you can't...

01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:56.740
You gotta make sure you pay attention

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.740
to the other one, you know?

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:00.740
So it's always two.

01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:02.740
Bye-bye.

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:04.740
Hi, girl. How you doing?

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:06.740
Got a little weird...

01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:08.740
Is that a bed head?

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:10.740
A little thing going on over there.

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:12.740
Right there.

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:14.740
Come.

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:16.740
I guess it's kind of cute.

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:18.740
It's kind of cute like you.

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:20.740
Kind of endearing.

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.740
Kind of cute.

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:26.740
Bye-bye.

01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:28.740
Dang, that skirt snatched.

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:34.740
Life seems rough.

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.740
I hope it gets better.

01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:38.740
I'm gonna say...

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.740
Ooh.

Thank you.

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:44.740
Thank you.

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:46.740
I'm gonna say...

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:48.740
How you doing?

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:50.740
Feel like a bartender?

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:52.740
Like in your bar or something?

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.740
Can I get milk now?

01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:58.740
I want milk.

01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:00.740
How do I get it?

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:02.740
How do I get milk?

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.740

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.740
Management.

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.740
Licenses.

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:10.740
Purchase.

01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:12.740
Milk, milk, milk, milk.

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:14.740
What the heck?

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:16.740
I just have a marker.

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:18.740
Milk, milk, milk.

01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:20.740
Milk, milk, milk.

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:22.740
Milk.

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.740
Bar.

01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:26.740
Wait, do I need a fridge?

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:28.740
How much is a fridge?

01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:32.740
Oh boy.

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:34.740
Okay.

01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:36.740
We got this.

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.740
Yeah, yeah.

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:40.740
Gotta make that buck runny.

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.740
Gotta make that buck runny.

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:44.740
When you gave me a hundred dollars.

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:46.740
Five, five, two...

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:50.740
Alright, Walter.

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.740

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:54.740
My apologies.

01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:56.740
Let's pretend...

01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:58.740
I said nothing.

01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.740
Go ahead and take that.

01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:02.740
And...

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.740
Complete a 50...

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.740

Have a nice day, Walter.

01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:20.740
Probably only got 100 buck runies.

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.740

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.740

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:27.380
was a whole accident it was a big complete accident you know how so they

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:36.740
like they back then I don't know if they do it the same but you know how you know

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:46.100
how when um uh you would uh you work at the cashier but every employee had their

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:56.420
own um little banky so we would have to take it out we would take the whole thing

01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:03.780
out and we'd take it with us to each register every time we go to a new register so we all

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:11.780
had our own little banky that we were in charge of and the finger in the safe yeah yeah that one

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:20.180
yeah so it would we so every time you would run out of money or something or something that you need

01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:27.060
change for you'd give them the big bills and then they would go into the safe and give you like

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:37.860
smaller bills and stuff so that you can like give change to the customer and stuff and I

01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:45.540
um they would take it expensive bye trevor bye bye

01:12:54.980 --> 01:13:03.460
uh much money oh so they would like give you change that you would need to um

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:14.500
uh give give give to the customer and I went to go give get change and they put the bill

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:21.780
like on the edge on top of the safe while it was open and I went to grab it like I went to like

01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:32.820
reach up to grab it and they closed the door of the safe like a giant metal safe

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:42.900
they closed it and it's not one where you put in a coat or anything they closed it on my finger

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:50.660
on my thumb because my thumb was hanging off you know like when you grab something you slide it

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:56.500
off slowly you could do it on the table right now and see how it is when you slide it grab it

01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:02.900
and then you slide it so my thumb was hanging off of this of the safe and they closed it right on my

01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:15.860
finger thank goodness she didn't um the uh they didn't close it all the way on my finger like it

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:23.300
didn't completely close or it probably would have been worse but they managed to open it back up

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:34.580
really quickly uh before it closed fully but my finger was shamushed it was split in two

01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:37.620
hey the big two

01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:43.460
hey and next day it was split in two

01:14:56.820 --> 01:15:03.540
working there was a nightmare it was a nightmare do you have a scar I have a small one

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:09.460
it's tiny it's not very visible um they didn't even have like a first aid kit

01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:16.980
and my boss was like just slap a bandaid on it and get back to work I was like oh okay

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:23.380
I was like I didn't scream or anything you know adrenaline rushed in and I was really I was the

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:32.020
calmest while everyone else was freaking out I was so calm super calm yeah

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:39.300
and then um I had to walk because they didn't want to call anyone to come get me so I had to walk to

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:48.260
the hospital on foot I had to walk I wish I knew I was really young so I wish I knew about you

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:54.820
know suing and stuff but two years already passed more than two years that's so long I don't like

01:15:55.060 --> 01:16:02.820
it way more than two years has passed so I think there's like a you can't really uh

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:10.580
so anyone after two two two years I think it's the thingy so I didn't know what I just moved on

01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:16.980
past it and ever since then I just hated that place they did more and more things that really

01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:24.660
made me upset so I had to walk to the hospital and they got like uh they put like skin glue

01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:30.580
on me uh and they had to like shift the finger they have to shift it

01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:39.060
for it to realign itself and then they stuck it together they smushed it together and then they

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:45.780
put skin glue on it to keep it together

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:46.900
so

01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:52.900
yeah

01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:02.820
and then they healed they healed after that had a big old band-aid and a big old band-aid it was

01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:10.900
like a big wrap around it

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:16.900
and

01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:24.100
yeah I think that's it wasn't worse it could be like what happened to a what do you say

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:31.620
I don't got nothing else for you get out yeah we don't sell sugar maybe

01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:40.900
I got some sort of sugar for you

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.900
ah

01:17:56.820 --> 01:18:02.260
it could be worse it could have been worse with my finger because I think the person who got it

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:09.460
the worst was um a family member of mine we had a doggie

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:21.140
we had a doggie and doggie was tied to the door the front door and

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:35.620
and family member decided to open door with doggie still tied to door and doggie loves outdoor

01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:41.460
loves outdoors you know loves out being outdoors and doggie slipped through the crack of the door

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:44.740
and pulled the door shut

01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:49.540
and family member

01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:54.740
lost finger

01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:00.260
finger was hanging on by skin

01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:05.620
um so it could have been worse

01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:18.500
I remember being traumatized by that I had it took me a long a long time to get over that scene

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:26.580

I

01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:38.120
Now that's gonna be stuck in my head really forever. I

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:54.160
Wonder what the other song is. Oh, it's this one. I like this one. This is my other one. That's my other favorite one

01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:02.880
It's called Invasion.

01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:05.880
It's my other favorite list here.

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:33.880
Yeah, I like that one.

01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:43.880
It's my other favorite one.

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:46.880
I have a customer.

01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:50.880
I need to buy a fridge.

01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:51.880
I want a duck.

01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:52.880
Duck?

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:53.880
I'm turning ducks.

01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:56.880
That's a lot of chickens.

01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:02.880
Look at all those chickens.

01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:11.880
I like, wait, hang on.

01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:16.880
So we're going to sell bread, cheese, and milk.

01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:23.880
Bread, bread, cheese, and milk.

01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:38.880
I'm going to make my own bread and my own cheese.

01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:39.880
I want to play Sonic.

01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:43.880
I want to play the old Sonic.

01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:44.880
I want to play a lot.

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.880
Welcome in everyone who came in.

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:50.880
I hope you all had a good day at work, school, wherever you're coming from and had a great day.

01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:51.880
Welcome in.

01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:52.880
You're not late.

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:53.880
Okay.

01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:54.880
That's fine.

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:55.880
It's perfectly fine.

01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:56.880
I love you.

01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:57.880
I love you.

01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:58.880
Welcome in.

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:00.880
You know the old.

01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:02.880
Oh, hang on.

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:29.880
I got it.

01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:30.880
Excuse me.

01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:31.880
I didn't hear that.

01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:35.880
I think I got a, I think I got a, I think I just drank some water.

01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:37.880
I think I just drank water.

01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:38.880
Mmm.

01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:43.880
I don't, I don't feel so good.

01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:50.880
I don't feel so good.

01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:59.880
I don't feel so good.

01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:08.880
I don't feel so good.

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:18.880
Oh my gosh.

01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:25.880
I hope that I found it.

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:32.880
I am feeling about, about to, I don't know.

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:37.880
It's a long line.

01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:38.880
Oh boy.

01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:41.880
We're fine.

01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:43.880
I am okay.

01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:48.880
I think I'm okay.

01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:50.880
I drank a whole bottle.

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:57.880
An entire whole bottle of green grape soju.

01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:06.880
I had a whole bottle.

01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:32.880
The discovery of cheese was by accident and bit the first cheese to taste tested.

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:37.880
I was probably consumed because it's like, well, that milk was the only thing I had for food.

01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:39.880
And then ate it for survival.

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:40.880
True.

01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:44.880
I think that's probably what happened.

01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:46.880
You know the first sonic?

01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:48.880
You know the very first sonic?

01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:49.880
Not the very first sonic.

01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:50.880
You know the one.

01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:53.880
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

01:47:53.880 --> 01:48:01.880
When you're underwater and you butt it down.

01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:03.880
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:08.880
I remember what sonic with that was.

01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:10.880
That's the first one really?

01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:13.880
I want to play that.

01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:17.880
I want to play that.

01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:22.880
That was like the best ADHD game ever.

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:44.640
I want to play that. It's not fair. Where is it? I can't find it anywhere. I don't think

01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:46.640
we can play Sonic on stream though, I don't think.

01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:16.080
Wasn't it?

01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:24.240
Why not? I don't think we can even find that game. I don't think. I don't think you can really find

01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:30.800
that. I don't think you're gonna be able to find that at all on PC. Give me.

01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:42.000
So sorry. I'm a little gassy. I'm so sorry. Oh, so unclassy. So unladylike.

01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:43.920
I'm a little gassy.

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:45.920
No

01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:11.480
Oh

01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:19.640
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:29.120
Sonic 2? I like the Sonic games a lot. I used to play them a lot when I was a

01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:34.920
kid. However, I wasn't allowed to play. I was second player. You know that kid

01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:43.940
that had the remote control that wasn't actually plugged in. I was second

01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:57.760
player. I wasn't allowed to play. But I was a pretty smart kid so I knew that I

01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:08.120
wasn't playing the game. So I figured it out really fast. I didn't complain though.

01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:13.320
Rest in peace. I'm God!

01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:30.800
I'm back.

01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:38.840
I'm back.

01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:17.160
Gas! See, I wasn't passing that kind of gas. I was just belching. I was just belching.

01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:22.920
What do you mean? I have a different sound. I was like lagging a little bit. Sorry, I'm

01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:38.080
catching up. I did a little bit of crashy. You know, I still have my Xbox 360. I've

01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:47.800
had it for years. I still have it and it works. I have a bunch of Xbox 360 games.

01:52:48.240 --> 01:53:01.600
Let me see. Let me look up at my bookshelf. Left 4 Dead 2, Payday 2. Does that be

01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:12.880
jeweled? I said Arkham, Arkham, Arkham, Arkham Asylum Batman. I have Assassin's Creed

01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:18.840
Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed. What other Assassin's Creed? The first one?

01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:28.440
Assassin's Creed 2. I have Sims, pets. Oh no, it's PC. That's a PC disc. Why is that

01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:39.720
in the middle of there? I have BioShock, BioShock Infinite, Call of Duty Black Ops 2. I have

01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:52.360
another Assassin's Creed. I think I bought two because one disc wasn't working. Assassin's

01:53:52.440 --> 01:54:05.760
Creed 4? Is that what that says? Grand Theft Auto? Grand Theft Auto? Yeah. Then I have another

01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:12.640
Call of Duty Black Ops 2 disc because the other one wasn't working. I have Destiny. I never really

01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:26.320
played it. Destiny. Final Fantasy X2. And then everything else is GameCube games. A bunch of

01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:34.600
GameCube games at PlayStation 2 games. I haven't been up there on that shelf in like four years.

01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:36.720
Everything's just been sitting up there.

01:54:54.720 --> 01:55:00.320
Yeah, my Xbox still works. I took kind of good care of it. I haven't received the red thing,

01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:07.760
red ring of death yet. It's still good. Still working. My other one used to turn on by itself.

01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:15.000
Actually, I think this is the one. If it's not unplugged, it turns on by itself. I don't know

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:25.600
why, but it turns on by itself. If you leave it plugged in, it will just turn on. I think that's

01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:34.000
the only thing wrong with it. All my other games are long gone.

01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:47.280
And then I have the Naruto Ultimate Ninja for PlayStation 2. I have all of them,

01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:52.400
except for one because someone stole it. I had Chronicles as well.

01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:02.160
I don't have four because I came out after I got the whole pack series.

01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:14.480
Then I have Storm Chronicles as well. I have the first Sims and Sims 2.

01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:24.640
I have the Brats. I remember getting that for my birthday long time ago. The Brats.

01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:32.960
It was a really fun game for Gamecube and Road Rage, the Simpsons Road Rage. I have that too.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:34.800
So enough there.

01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:48.400
Yeah, games up there. Everything else broke, so everything else had to go in the trash.

01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:54.880
A lot of CD discs broke. I had Super Smash Bros for Gamecube. Both discs broke.

01:56:55.440 --> 01:57:06.560
My favorite Pokemon game was Colosseum. Pokemon Colosseum was my favorite one. Was it Pokemon

01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:21.120
Colosseum? It was. Haha. It was my favorite Pokemon game. I played that on Gamecube.

01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:29.120
I played that like five times before it broke.

01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:42.640
A family member of mine thought that they could fix the Gamecube and they ended up

01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:47.440
breaking it further by taking it apart, so I could never play it again. Then they broke the

01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:51.440
discs to the Smash Bros and Colosseum.

01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:03.360
Any Kirby? I didn't get to play Kirby. I was only allowed to watch, sadly.

01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:10.320
I was a brokey growing up, so I could only get my hands on so much. The majority of the games

01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:14.800
that I got was free. People who were done playing it and didn't want it anymore,

01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:22.080
so I was very lucky to be able to play a lot of the games. I think there was this one scary game

01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:29.040
with aliens or something on PlayStation 2. Extermination? I think it was called extermination.

01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:34.320
I don't have that anymore either. I used to play that too. I think it was the only scary game that

01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:46.000
I could stomach besides Resident Evil 6? Six and four? Or was it three? No, not three.

01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:50.320
Which one's the one with silver in it?

01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:03.040
Which one's that one? Which one was that one in Resident Evil?

01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:14.880
Five? Resident Evil 5? Yeah, that's the one. I can only play Resident Evil 5 and 6. It wasn't

01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:22.480
scary. It wasn't too scary for me. Don't have a lot of jump scares. Do I have a Wii? I do have a Wii.

01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:29.440
My favorite game to play on the Wii was the Michael Jackson game. It kept me fit.

01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:34.720
I knew all the dances, all the dance moves. I still do.

01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:46.160
I remember playing the dance games on the Gamecube 2. We had the little dance pad,

01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:56.880
the little plastic dance pad. You step on it. I remember that too. We had that too.

01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:12.880
Good night to anyone heading to bed. Have a sweet dream. Thank you for stopping by. Appreciate you.

02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:38.000
Is that real? It came with a Michael's glove? I think so. I don't remember.

02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:42.080
I don't remember the glove. We had the game for so long. I don't remember.

02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:48.400
It was really fun dancing to it. I would literally do that over stream.

02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:55.200
But I don't think we can play any other songs on stream. I don't think. I don't think.

02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:07.840
My first zombie game was Left 4 Dead. My first zombie game was Left 4 Dead too. I have it right up there.

02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:13.360
That was my very first game that I played. It was Left 4 Dead.

02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:23.040
Do you have Gamecube games to play it on? Do you have a Gamecube to play it on? No.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:32.960
I no longer have one. I haven't had one for over 10 years. It's been 10 years.

02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:36.720
I have one in a minute.

02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:41.520
That was one in a minute.

02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:58.240
I still have my remote controls though. I have an orange one and a gray one.

02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:00.960
Had a purple one. I don't know where that went. Disappeared.

02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:05.600
I still have my orange remote. It was my favorite remote.

02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:12.640
Yeah, I still have it sitting right there.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:31.360
Do I have Gamecube games? Yeah, I do. I have the Bratz and Road Rage. The Simpsons Road Rage.

02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:38.560
Those are my only two Gamecube games I still have. I lost the Colosseum game. That was broken long time ago.

02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:43.200
Oh, and I have the Michael Jackson game.

02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:56.560
My mom is a little bit of a gamer, but I highly doubt that she'll let me touch her Mario game.

02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:04.000
I do not think she'll let me touch it.

02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:12.960
She bit me up.

02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:18.960
Highly doubt she'll let me touch that.

02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:22.240
She plays that like every day.

02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:33.040
She plays her Super Mario game every day. I think they got the newest one too.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Oh, I forgot I was writing the story. I guess I'm golfing story time.

02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:11.440
Ah, I have two milks, one bread.

02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:19.920
I am via fritz now.

02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:32.000
Purchase. I ran up with our cheese in it.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:48.000
How much is she as? Oh, we can sell it for five dollars. She does it expensive. What the hell?

02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:08.240
I missed the crabs now.

02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:22.000
Yeah, Pokemon Colosseum is my favorite Pokemon game for a long time.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Ah, I'm starting to get hit with the sleeps. I'm going to eat me really fast. I feel so old.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:06:15.120
I would love to play Left 4 Dead with the girls. That sounds so fun.

02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:26.240
It's like a trip down memory lane. Like hardcore. Hardcore down memory lane.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:07:01.280
Yeah, I remember. I remember playing Final Fantasy a long time ago.

02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:09.120
I remember it like it was yesterday. I didn't have a bed. I didn't have a bed frame. I didn't own one.

02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:22.960
I stopped on the floor. The hard floor. I remember. We had those big bulky TVs.

02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:33.920
You know, the old TVs. Big bulky TVs. I had to play PlayStation 2.

02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:45.520
That was the first time I got to play a game really, myself, to myself that I owned.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:08:02.160
I remember I was given Final Fantasy X2 as a gift and I used to watch all the Final Fantasy games.

02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:07.840
I really like Final Fantasy and I think someone in my family was like, I heard you like this game.

02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:14.400
I don't know which one this is, but here's this one and it gave it to me and I played it.

02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:19.360
I never got to finish that game. Never got to finish it.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:28.880
There I got to finish it because the disc was scratched in a specific spot.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:33.360
A really small specific spot was damaged on the disc.

02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:39.840
So whenever I got near the ending of the game, it would freeze.

02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:47.680
The crash and freeze. I'd start over mainly because I didn't have a memory disc.

02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:55.120
So I had to play the game from the start because I didn't own a memory disc. All my other memory

02:08:55.120 --> 02:09:06.080
discs were lost or stolen. So I started the game over from the start and I would play all the way

02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:10.160
through because I thought maybe it was just an issue with something and I'd play it all the way

02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:16.080
through and I'd get to that concert part. The concert. Never got to get to you.

02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:27.440
Never got to you. And then the game crashes. I realized that it was just a scratch on the disc

02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:38.560
and I was never going to be able to finish it. That was a good game though.

02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:48.640
I did the same thing with Pokemon Colosseum as well. I finished the game and then someone

02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:58.320
lent me their, I had the disc still. Someone lent me their Gamecube and I got to play the game but

02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:04.960
I had to like zoom through it because I didn't have a memory disc. So I had to play it again

02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:14.320
one last time. That person was very nice and I gave them back their Gamecube. I was very happy.

02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:28.320
They lent me play one last time.

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:45.040
I was so excited to get my first job.

02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:54.000
When I was crazy, my first job was actually this job. It was the job where I hurt my finger.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:11:00.640
That was my very first job. My very first official job.

02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:14.800
I was so happy. I bought so many things. I bought this disc that I still have but unfortunately

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:18.640
I messed up and I didn't realize that this disc was actually a dinner table.

02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:23.440
This is why I have a dinner table disc.

02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:45.280
So my clamp on for the for the my microphone stand thingy is like barely hanging on because

02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:51.520
this is not properly clamped because the outside part like comes out.

02:11:55.280 --> 02:12:00.960
That's why I added a desk on the the thingy. I think I mentioned this before how I just add

02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:08.960
I add random things due to what I like experienced or went through. Like I could tell you a story

02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:14.560
almost all the things I added onto that list of things on the throne.

02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:24.560
So it was the first time I got that job and I started buying like I was saving up as much

02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:34.960
about this desk. I bought me a like a bed frame my first bed frame. I was lent the mattress.

02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:39.200
One gave me a mattress so I still have that mattress to this day.

02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:46.160
I got my first dresser because I never had a dresser.

02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:55.440
I had an old one and my cat used to sleep in it. He used to pull it open and he

02:12:55.440 --> 02:13:00.720
will sleep at the bottom of it. I had a little table. I got my first TV.

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:05.760
All of that with this job and these bookshelves and stuff.

02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:12.960
Then after that I saved up as much as possible and I got my first PC.

02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:21.440
I broke my motherboard to that PC though. It was an accident. It was my first time really like

02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:29.680
doing stuff with a PC. It was my very first time and I snapped my motherboard in half.

02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:49.680
I didn't know about like unscrewing stuff and how to move stuff. I thought I unscrewed it

02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:55.760
really well and I was like moving stuff and then I like pulled on it. I'm like maybe I have to like

02:13:55.760 --> 02:14:01.600
pull on it a little more and I pulled on it and it's like I'm like

02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:34.880
okay and then after that I broke. I got another PC and I broke my graphics card.

02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:41.760
I yanked that out because the first one was really hard to come out so I thought it was

02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:48.960
going to be the same for the next one and I just yanked it out and the part that's usually like

02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:55.120
clamped in on the thingy came off and came off the graphics card.

02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:12.080
And then the fans broke on it too so that's the reason why I was taking it out. I was

02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:17.280
going to try and replace the fans but then it ended up where I had to replace the whole thing.

02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:30.080
How expensive was that mistake? I was really broke so I had to, I was saving up a lot of

02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:36.560
money to get new parts so I had to use the money that I was saving up to get a new computer which

02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:46.800
only cost me like 800, 899 dollars. I got it on Black Friday. It was a Black Friday. I got it

02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:57.120
right after Thanksgiving. I got it on a Black Friday. Well, Cyber Monday. They call it Cyber

02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:05.120
Monday. It's people who can't really go out on Black Friday so yeah I got it like 899 dollars.

02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:12.240
It was on sale. It was on sale. It was a really cheap computer.

02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:26.080
I still got it though it's falling apart and it's what I was streaming with

02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:36.000
before this for a while. I had to take off the glass because it was overheating and I needed

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:45.120
to put a fan and like facing it to blow on it. It was overheating really bad. My CPU was bad.

02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:54.960
Everything was bad. It was falling apart. I still got it. I was really surprised.

02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:06.240
I was really happy when Strony found me and Strony found me. I had like the worst equipment.

02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:15.200
So when everyone says, when everyone's really confused about why my audio and everything's

02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:25.680
so bad now, I had horrible equipment before this. I have no clue how to work this equipment.

02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:34.960
I'm so new to using all this stuff. It's so technical. I'm just like

02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:44.080
yeah yeah yeah yeah but I'm pretty nerdy and geeky in the sense where I like to study this

02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:52.240
stuff so I watched a bunch of videos learning how to work stuff. I'm learning. It's going to take

02:17:52.240 --> 02:18:14.000
me time though. I had the worst equipment. So I'm very happy. Strony saved me.

02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:26.800
Literally just before, just before things went down and I got the email. Two of my fans stopped

02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:39.600
working. Two of my fans stopped working. The fans on my graphics card. One of the fans wouldn't spin.

02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:45.920
She has saved me. She has saved me.

02:18:57.360 --> 02:18:58.880
She sent me up really good.

02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:07.680
My monitors were like breaking slowly. The color in the monitors were leaving.

02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:18.240
It was bad. I was the brokest of the brokest. I have tape on everything. I currently have tape

02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:23.520
on my chair. She can only help me put so much. I think I mentioned this.

02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:33.360
She can only help me put so much.

02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:45.840
My milk is really selling. I really like my milk.

02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:53.280
All milk.

02:19:53.360 --> 02:20:11.920
It's nice to meet all of you. I know there is new of you in here and stuff so I want to say

02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:19.120

02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:26.880
a mix of vibes here. They're really the same. So I hope you understand.

02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:53.760
I am milk and bread. I'm getting a little bit. I even have a little bit. A lot of

02:20:54.720 --> 02:20:55.440
bit a little bit.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.280

02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:16.640

02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:36.640

Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:10.160
Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you.

Happy birthday dear bread. Happy birthday to you.

02:22:40.480 --> 02:22:50.000
Have a good one. I hope you enjoy your birthday.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:23:09.840
I would never.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:37.600
I'm glad to be here. I'm happy that you're here too.

02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:46.000
I'm very happy that you're here. I'm glad that all of you are here. Thank you all for being here.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:53.600
All of your bird support. You're all sweet and I appreciate you all very much. Please leave.

02:23:56.880 --> 02:24:04.000
Yeah I like that. Goat cheers. Goat cheers. Goat milk. Yeah grab it. That's right.

02:24:04.960 --> 02:24:05.440
Yeah.

02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:21.040
This game is fun. It's very like the fun game you just play on the side when you're especially

02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:28.400
when you're not all up there in the head. This is a great game to play especially when you're not

02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:34.560
all up there in the head. You just relax and play this game and enjoy your time.

02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:45.040
Look at your shirt. I want to touch his forehead. It looks like it looks like it'll be soft.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:51.600
Oh that'll be soft. I'll touch you. Poke at it.

02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:54.560
Poke poke. Travis is back. They are.

02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:11.280
My head is hurting. My head is starting to hurt.

02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:27.280
Water. I don't need water.

02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:35.120
Whoa.

02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:50.000
Whoa. I had green grab. Green grab. So joy. It was good. Very yummy.

02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:50.720
Yeah.

02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:06.800
I have other. I have two more soju. I don't think it's good. I didn't drink it right now.

02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:10.560
I wanted to save it for another special occasion.

02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:14.400
Oh. Well.

02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:31.280
Taking money back. You can take your money back by right clicking on the bills in the

02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:38.320
cash register. Thank you. I'll just take that. Thank you.

02:26:40.560 --> 02:27:10.200
I think this will be the last day for this game.

02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:16.460
We'll get through this day and we'll just stop and chat it up for a bit.

02:27:16.460 --> 02:27:17.960
Last day, last day.

02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:27.160
I'm, I'm, yippee, like, yippee.

02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:37.440
Well, I think it's my headphones.

02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:42.280
Do you guys ever get, like, these, like, crazy headaches from your headphones being on your

02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:43.920
head for too long?

02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:49.760
And here's my headphones.

02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:55.320
They, like, squishing my head.

02:27:55.320 --> 02:28:06.400
My head is being, like, squished, squished, and I'm hot, I'm so hot.

02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:08.640
Oh, get this off me!

02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:16.520
Are you ever fine?

02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:18.600
Oh.

02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:21.280
Oh, it's so hot.

02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:25.200
I'm burning.

02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:27.640
Oh my god.

02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:29.800
Oh, I hate clothes.

02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:30.840
Why wear clothes?

02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:33.280
Clothes is unnecessary.

02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:36.000
You don't need a...

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.800
Oh.

02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:41.640
Oh.

02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:49.120
Oh my god.

02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:52.600
Okay, I'm sorry if this fan...

02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:54.240
Oh, it's too high.

02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:56.720
Are you?

02:28:56.720 --> 02:29:00.880
Oh, okay.

02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:03.000
It gets boiling in my room.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:04.360
You don't understand.

02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:10.000
If you guys didn't help me get this fan, I would have been melting in here.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:16.240
Like, like, this is what I was used to, this is what I had to deal with.

02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:21.760
I would sweat, like, no tomorrow, and I usually don't sweat.

02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:28.600
I sweat in random places, like, the bitties and stuff, you know?

02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:32.120
It would sweat, like, crazy.

02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:33.680
And my armpit, and that's it.

02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:34.920
I wouldn't sweat anywhere else.

02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:36.400
My forehead, don't sweat.

02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:40.920
I'm dry everywhere else.

02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:51.320
So I don't know why, but I sweat everywhere else, like, under the bubba, under bubba, would

02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:53.120
sweat, crazy.

02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:09.120
It gets so hot in here.

02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:18.120
Oh, man.

02:30:18.120 --> 02:30:30.480
Well, I kind of, like, technically I suffer from headaches 24-7, so I'm, like, it could

02:30:30.480 --> 02:30:39.000
just be, like, a, you know, like, an addition, you know what I mean?

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:50.160
Like, an addition, an additional pain, since, you know, I suffer from headaches all the time.

02:30:50.160 --> 02:30:57.160
So, like, the combination of the half-ones and everything else just, like, sucks.

02:30:57.840 --> 02:30:59.840
Well.

02:30:59.840 --> 02:31:02.840
Oh, we passed the day.

We'll chat for a bit, don't worry, but if you guys got to go, that's understandable.

02:31:31.520 --> 02:31:36.520
But I'm done with Supermarket for now.

02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:43.520
I'm done with the Supermarket, for the time being.

02:31:43.520 --> 02:31:52.520

This fan has been a blessing.

02:32:42.680 --> 02:32:48.680
Your offering of this fan was the best, the best offering ever.

02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:54.760
It feels so good, so good.

02:32:54.840 --> 02:33:01.840

02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:10.220
hours

02:36:29.540 --> 02:36:31.320
For your water balance

02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:33.560
That's fine

02:36:34.660 --> 02:36:36.180
Don't worry about that

02:36:36.180 --> 02:36:41.180
That's, that's fine, that's covered, that's okay.

02:36:52.180 --> 02:36:55.140
I'm a little bit ipsy, but I'm coming off it.

02:36:56.380 --> 02:36:59.380
I'm hungry and I haven't really eaten anything

02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:00.820
except for this chicken.

02:37:02.500 --> 02:37:04.380
And my stomach is like,

02:37:06.260 --> 02:37:08.460
growling at me right now.

02:37:18.540 --> 02:37:19.660
I'm really hungry.

02:37:23.100 --> 02:37:28.100
I wanna order food, but I don't think it's a wise idea.

02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:31.340
I got the bill leaves coming up.

02:37:32.820 --> 02:37:34.380
I got the bills coming up.

02:37:36.460 --> 02:37:41.460
And my, my mama Dulay left again.

02:37:42.820 --> 02:37:47.820
She left, she's not here again, so I'm gonna starve.

02:37:52.020 --> 02:37:54.180
My source of food is gone.

02:38:06.300 --> 02:38:11.300
You stand in your shower, not me.

02:38:20.060 --> 02:38:22.260
I sit in my shower like a psychopath.

02:38:36.780 --> 02:38:41.740
I can't stand for long.

02:38:41.740 --> 02:38:45.100
I can't even stand for longer than like 10 minutes, bro.

02:38:45.100 --> 02:38:48.900
My spine hurts, I guess it's down.

02:38:48.900 --> 02:38:51.140
I sit down and I let it run on me like,

02:38:53.540 --> 02:38:58.220
a blasting hot boiling water right on my chest.

02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:11.860
The water feels so good, it makes my legs wobble.

02:39:11.860 --> 02:39:13.180
So I gotta sit down.

02:39:16.100 --> 02:39:16.940
Go sit down.

02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:20.940
Yo, my stomach is like,

02:39:25.900 --> 02:39:29.540
I wish I could like, I wish you could like hear it.

02:39:29.540 --> 02:39:32.420
I wish I could like bring you to it so you could hear it.

02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:34.060
It is going.

02:39:37.140 --> 02:39:39.900
I ate some cereal.

02:39:39.900 --> 02:39:42.060
Maybe that'll just sum up my hunger.

02:39:43.460 --> 02:39:44.620
I ate some cereal.

02:39:50.620 --> 02:39:51.900
Yeah, here it goes.

02:39:56.380 --> 02:39:57.220
Ah, no!

02:39:57.220 --> 02:39:58.060
Ah, I got it.

02:39:59.340 --> 02:40:02.620
Can't waste a single piece of cereal.

02:40:03.620 --> 02:40:07.940
We brokeie brokeie, we can't waste a single piece.

02:40:07.940 --> 02:40:09.180
It almost fell.

02:40:33.620 --> 02:40:34.460
Mm.

02:40:41.060 --> 02:40:43.220
Sitting in the shower is nasty work.

02:40:43.220 --> 02:40:45.700
Hey, I cleaned the shower.

02:40:45.700 --> 02:40:48.740
I wiped that, that I've wiped that bitch down real good,

02:40:48.740 --> 02:40:49.580
all right?

02:40:49.580 --> 02:40:53.620
If I clean it, it's clean enough for me, all right?

02:40:53.620 --> 02:40:54.940
I have OCD.

02:40:57.780 --> 02:40:59.620
Whoa, thank you, thank you so much

02:40:59.620 --> 02:41:02.220
for the food all the time, thank you, thank you.

02:41:03.620 --> 02:41:06.980
If I clean my shower, it's clean, all right?

02:41:06.980 --> 02:41:08.860
I understand how people feel though,

02:41:08.860 --> 02:41:11.580
about not wanting to shower in other people's showers.

02:41:13.060 --> 02:41:14.140
Feel a little dirty.

02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:17.060
I know that feeling.

02:41:17.060 --> 02:41:19.340
My shower is good, right?

02:41:19.340 --> 02:41:20.300
I clean it.

02:41:23.540 --> 02:41:25.580
The bathroom is like my safe haven.

02:41:27.380 --> 02:41:29.140
I spend the most time on there.

02:41:30.620 --> 02:41:31.460
Oh, yeah.

02:41:33.260 --> 02:41:35.980
I sit on a toilet watching memes for like,

02:41:35.980 --> 02:41:37.980
for like three hours.

02:41:40.460 --> 02:41:41.300
Oh.

02:41:41.300 --> 02:41:42.140
Oh.

02:41:43.140 --> 02:41:43.980
Mm-hmm.

02:41:54.140 --> 02:41:54.980
Mm-hmm.

02:42:00.420 --> 02:42:01.260
Mm-hmm.

02:42:05.260 --> 02:42:06.100
Oh.

02:42:08.180 --> 02:42:09.540
I didn't think about life.

02:42:09.540 --> 02:42:11.300
I bring my phone with me.

02:42:11.300 --> 02:42:13.620
I'm really sad when I forget my phone.

02:42:16.340 --> 02:42:20.980
I get really sad, I'm like, no, no memes.

02:42:20.980 --> 02:42:21.820
No.

02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:22.860
Mm-hmm.

02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:30.940
I know you start reading stuff off of like,

02:42:30.940 --> 02:42:33.780
bottles, ingredients off the bottles.

02:42:35.140 --> 02:42:35.980
Mm-hmm.

02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:36.900
Mm-hmm.

02:42:48.820 --> 02:42:50.420
Showering in other people's showers

02:42:50.420 --> 02:42:51.820
is how you get foot fungus?

02:42:51.820 --> 02:42:52.660
Ew.

02:42:56.100 --> 02:42:58.100
You ain't gonna get that in my shower.

02:42:58.100 --> 02:43:01.380
Not with my family's OCD.

02:43:06.980 --> 02:43:09.220
You know how many times a week my,

02:43:11.380 --> 02:43:12.220
my,

02:43:15.220 --> 02:43:17.060
mama delay cleans?

02:43:17.060 --> 02:43:18.460
Do you know how many times?

02:43:20.380 --> 02:43:22.580
Yeah, I don't think you have to worry about foot fungus.

02:43:24.580 --> 02:43:25.420
Mm-hmm.

02:43:35.980 --> 02:43:36.820
Mm-hmm.

02:43:44.500 --> 02:43:48.020
No, I think it's an average amount of time that you clean.

02:43:53.420 --> 02:43:54.260
Mm-hmm.

02:43:58.380 --> 02:44:00.700
She cleans every time she uses it.

02:44:00.700 --> 02:44:03.660
Every time she uses the bathroom, she cleans it.

02:44:03.660 --> 02:44:04.500
No.

02:44:13.100 --> 02:44:14.340
I do the same thing.

02:44:14.340 --> 02:44:16.100
I also clean it before I use it.

02:44:17.180 --> 02:44:19.060
I wipe the seat down.

02:44:19.060 --> 02:44:22.340
I don't want my poor, soft, sensitive skin touching the

02:44:22.340 --> 02:44:24.100
seats that someone else sat on.

02:44:28.100 --> 02:44:29.020
I'm nervous.

02:44:30.060 --> 02:44:32.600
So I clean it every time before I sit on it.

02:44:33.660 --> 02:44:34.500
Mm-hmm.

02:44:44.780 --> 02:44:46.100
Mm.

02:44:46.100 --> 02:44:47.780
Thank you, thank you for the $2 to help.

02:44:47.780 --> 02:44:49.660
Thank you, I'm not a mouse.

02:44:49.660 --> 02:44:50.500
Thank you.

02:45:02.460 --> 02:45:03.620
Mm-hmm.

02:45:03.620 --> 02:45:04.780
Thank you, thank you.

02:45:04.780 --> 02:45:05.620
Mm-hmm.

02:45:08.380 --> 02:45:09.220
Oh.

02:45:14.820 --> 02:45:17.860
Thinking about life as reserve for the shower.

02:45:17.860 --> 02:45:20.300
I think about some ratchet things in the shower.

02:45:20.620 --> 02:45:21.460
Mm-hmm.

02:45:21.460 --> 02:45:22.300
Mm-hmm.

02:45:27.940 --> 02:45:29.820
My imagination runs wild.

02:45:31.340 --> 02:45:32.180
Mm-hmm.

02:45:34.620 --> 02:45:37.620
Sometimes I even bring my iPad with me.

02:45:37.620 --> 02:45:39.940
iPad and put it on a little stand.

02:45:39.940 --> 02:45:42.420
And I watch things in the shower.

02:45:42.420 --> 02:45:43.260
Mm-hmm.

02:45:58.140 --> 02:46:00.020
Yes, you may, you may use my lap.

02:46:00.540 --> 02:46:01.740
You can use my lap.

02:46:01.740 --> 02:46:03.140
I'm always sitting in chat.

02:46:12.340 --> 02:46:13.180
Mm-hmm.

02:46:19.180 --> 02:46:20.020
Mm-hmm.

02:46:30.020 --> 02:46:30.860
Mm-hmm.

02:46:39.020 --> 02:46:39.860
Mm-hmm.

02:46:43.700 --> 02:46:44.540
Mm-hmm.

02:46:44.540 --> 02:46:46.460
Shower iPad is wild.

02:46:46.460 --> 02:46:47.300
Oh, man.

02:46:49.220 --> 02:46:51.260
Man, I'm bored, I get bored.

02:46:52.380 --> 02:46:54.660
Did you get bored taking a shower?

02:46:54.660 --> 02:46:56.860
I'm bored, I gotta bring some entertainment.

02:46:56.860 --> 02:46:57.700
Oh, man.

02:46:57.700 --> 02:46:59.780
I'm bored, I gotta bring some entertainment.

02:46:59.780 --> 02:47:00.620
Oh.

02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:01.460
Oh, man.

02:47:19.460 --> 02:47:22.020
Clearly, she means she watches my hero academia.

02:47:22.020 --> 02:47:23.460
I do.

02:47:23.460 --> 02:47:24.940
But not on the iPad.

02:47:27.700 --> 02:47:28.540
Mm-hmm.

02:47:42.540 --> 02:47:43.620
I mean my cereal.

02:47:45.660 --> 02:47:47.060
That's actually really good.

02:47:48.140 --> 02:47:49.740
Tasted really good.

02:47:49.740 --> 02:47:51.740
I'm running out of cereal.

02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:52.580
No.

02:47:57.700 --> 02:47:58.540
Mm-hmm.

02:48:10.620 --> 02:48:12.340
I always play music while I shower,

02:48:12.340 --> 02:48:14.620
so I don't have to think about life.

02:48:14.620 --> 02:48:16.220
Music isn't enough for me.

02:48:17.580 --> 02:48:20.060
Music, I resonate with music too much

02:48:20.060 --> 02:48:24.780
that it puts me in the, it makes me think sometimes.

02:48:24.780 --> 02:48:27.500
So instead, I gotta dance in the shower

02:48:27.540 --> 02:48:28.820
while playing music.

02:48:32.100 --> 02:48:35.820
But sometimes, because my range in music is so broad,

02:48:36.700 --> 02:48:38.780
if I play with songs on shuffle,

02:48:38.780 --> 02:48:41.420
there's a high chance I'm gonna get hit with a sad song.

02:48:41.420 --> 02:48:42.540
And I don't want that song.

02:48:44.340 --> 02:48:46.100
I already had that happen twice.

02:48:47.540 --> 02:48:48.780
And I said to myself,

02:48:48.780 --> 02:48:51.780
I am not gonna play music, it's a shower anymore.

02:48:52.780 --> 02:48:58.580
I had me sad, and it had me feeling like Vegeta in the rain.

02:49:03.940 --> 02:49:06.100
That Vegeta gift in the rain.

02:49:22.620 --> 02:49:24.500
You scared to put your electronics in your water?

02:49:24.500 --> 02:49:25.740
Just get a little cover.

02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:27.100
Get a water cover.

02:49:27.100 --> 02:49:28.900
Protect your electronics.

02:49:29.900 --> 02:49:30.740
It'll be fine.

02:49:30.740 --> 02:49:31.580
Mm-hmm.

02:49:34.740 --> 02:49:35.580
No!

02:49:36.580 --> 02:49:38.380
I dropped some cereal.

02:49:38.380 --> 02:49:39.220
No!

02:49:48.220 --> 02:49:49.060
Mm-hmm.

02:49:51.780 --> 02:49:52.620
Mm-hmm.

02:50:02.100 --> 02:50:05.180
I watched anime in the shower.

02:50:05.180 --> 02:50:06.020
I'd do them.

02:50:06.860 --> 02:50:09.620
I even watched a movie in the shower.

02:50:09.620 --> 02:50:10.460
Mm-hmm.

02:50:10.460 --> 02:50:11.300
Mm-hmm.

02:50:22.620 --> 02:50:23.460
Mm-hmm.

02:50:26.620 --> 02:50:27.900
That's why you gotta make a playlist

02:50:27.900 --> 02:50:29.980
for specific moods.

02:50:33.140 --> 02:50:34.860
I'm too organized that

02:50:37.580 --> 02:50:38.940
my playlists are like

02:50:40.460 --> 02:50:41.380
emo,

02:50:43.060 --> 02:50:43.900
rock,

02:50:46.900 --> 02:50:48.660
Japanese openings,

02:50:49.540 --> 02:50:50.660
and songs.

02:50:52.140 --> 02:50:53.060
K-pop.

02:50:54.460 --> 02:50:55.300
R&B.

02:51:06.700 --> 02:51:08.380
My playlist is too broad.

02:51:09.500 --> 02:51:10.340
I can't do that,

02:51:10.340 --> 02:51:13.660
because then one day I'm gonna be listening to rock,

02:51:13.660 --> 02:51:14.500
and I'm like,

02:51:15.860 --> 02:51:17.140
and then I'm gonna be like,

02:51:17.140 --> 02:51:19.300
well, I wanna listen to this specific song

02:51:19.300 --> 02:51:20.940
that's also kind of rock-ish,

02:51:20.940 --> 02:51:21.900
but it's not rock-ish.

02:51:21.900 --> 02:51:23.180
It's in the Japanese playlist.

02:51:23.180 --> 02:51:24.660
Now I gotta go to the Japanese playlist

02:51:24.660 --> 02:51:25.820
and you'll find the song.

02:51:26.820 --> 02:51:27.860
Just to play the song.

02:51:27.860 --> 02:51:30.100
That's why I just leave everything on shuffle.

02:51:30.100 --> 02:51:30.940
Mm-hmm.

02:51:33.300 --> 02:51:34.580
Just leave it on shuffle.

02:51:46.380 --> 02:51:48.780
Do I listen to blues rock music?

02:51:48.780 --> 02:51:50.220
I think so.

02:51:50.220 --> 02:51:51.140
Sometimes.

02:51:52.740 --> 02:51:53.780
What's cereal you're eating?

02:51:53.780 --> 02:51:55.020
My favorite kind.

02:51:56.860 --> 02:51:58.140
Captain Crunch,

02:51:58.140 --> 02:51:59.020
peanut butter.

02:52:14.140 --> 02:52:16.260
I'm not pouring another bowl.

02:52:16.260 --> 02:52:18.340
I didn't eat the other one really fast.

02:52:18.340 --> 02:52:20.260
I don't know what you're talking about.

02:52:20.260 --> 02:52:22.100
This is only my second bowl.

02:52:22.100 --> 02:52:22.940
Right?

02:52:41.860 --> 02:52:43.380
I like cinnamon toast crunch,

02:52:43.380 --> 02:52:44.220
but...

02:52:45.220 --> 02:52:48.660
Okay, let's see it this way.

02:52:48.660 --> 02:52:52.620
Imagine eating something for three years straight.

02:52:52.620 --> 02:52:53.620
The same thing.

02:52:53.620 --> 02:52:55.820
Nothing else, nothing new.

02:52:55.820 --> 02:52:57.300
Three years straight.

02:52:57.300 --> 02:52:58.660
The same thing.

02:52:58.660 --> 02:53:03.660
Over and over and over and over and over and over again.

02:53:05.580 --> 02:53:07.380
Are you not gonna get tired of it?

02:53:08.940 --> 02:53:11.740
Cinnamon toast crunch used to be my favorite cereal

02:53:11.740 --> 02:53:12.660
in the past.

02:53:15.060 --> 02:53:19.540
But it was all my mom ever bought.

02:53:23.580 --> 02:53:25.820
So I got tired of it really fast.

02:53:44.860 --> 02:53:45.820
Three years straight.

02:53:47.860 --> 02:53:49.260
It was all we could afford.

02:53:51.060 --> 02:53:52.300
All the other brands were,

02:53:52.300 --> 02:53:54.300
or stuff were a little more expensive.

02:53:55.700 --> 02:53:57.460
But we couldn't get anything else.

02:53:59.220 --> 02:54:02.980
She would only buy that and Lucky Charms.

02:54:02.980 --> 02:54:04.860
But we weren't allowed to eat the Lucky Charms.

02:54:04.860 --> 02:54:06.860
They were hers and hers alone.

02:54:07.900 --> 02:54:08.860
Oh, we ate Lucky Charms.

02:54:08.860 --> 02:54:09.820
You'd get angry.

02:54:14.620 --> 02:54:17.140
Sorry I have a lot of aunties within my class.

02:54:22.340 --> 02:54:23.940
I would star in an ice cream bar,

02:54:23.940 --> 02:54:24.500
a hit sparkling tea bar

02:54:24.500 --> 02:54:25.660
or a social television bar,

02:54:25.660 --> 02:54:27.660
too stupid to be an ice cream lover.

02:54:27.700 --> 02:54:31.660
I would be an ice cream lover if they'd offered me ice cream.

02:54:32.460 --> 02:54:33.620
Friends would do that,

02:54:33.620 --> 02:54:34.980
without 보이 rice and other cereals.

02:54:37.820 --> 02:54:39.340
Three, four, three, four.

02:54:39.340 --> 02:54:40.220
Let's go.

02:54:44.220 --> 02:54:46.220
How long was your longest shower?

02:54:48.140 --> 02:54:50.340
Five hours I fell asleep. I

02:54:51.860 --> 02:54:54.500
Fell asleep then slid down and almost drowned

02:55:14.220 --> 02:55:18.980
It woke me up there's a great big splash to the face

02:55:44.820 --> 02:55:46.820
I

02:55:49.780 --> 02:55:51.780
Rice is different though

02:55:52.220 --> 02:55:56.460
You ate rice for 22 years rice is different. I fucking love rice

02:55:56.460 --> 02:56:02.260
I don't think I'll ever get tired of rice. You could do so many things with rice so many different combinations with rice

02:56:02.260 --> 02:56:04.260
Rice is like the best the best thing ever

02:56:05.100 --> 02:56:07.820
People talk down a white rice. Right rice is amazing

02:56:07.820 --> 02:56:09.820
A little bit of salt

02:56:12.500 --> 02:56:15.540
Me some rice fried rice work rice

02:56:17.620 --> 02:56:19.620
All the rice

02:56:19.780 --> 02:56:23.940
Rice and peas rice and beans rice rice rice rice rice rice rice

02:56:25.980 --> 02:56:29.340
That's literally why I put a rice cooker on my throat

02:56:38.660 --> 02:56:44.380
My family has a rice cooker, but I'm not allowed to use it

02:56:46.380 --> 02:56:48.900
I'm not allowed to use the the rice cooker

02:56:53.900 --> 02:56:58.980
It's cuz I have really bad memory my memory is really really really bad and

02:57:03.060 --> 02:57:07.220
My my mom wasn't aware that if you leave the rice cooker closed

02:57:08.020 --> 02:57:11.220
Insealed the rice is still good for the next day

02:57:12.580 --> 02:57:14.580
It's still good for the next day

02:57:15.220 --> 02:57:19.660
But she kept opening it and then leaving it open

02:57:20.460 --> 02:57:23.500
And then complaining that there was mold on it

02:57:24.060 --> 02:57:26.060
I

02:57:34.260 --> 02:57:42.580
So I had a teacher to stop opening it and leaving it open but because of the whole situation medication time

02:57:53.660 --> 02:57:59.340
My alarm went off medication time

02:58:01.100 --> 02:58:04.140
But I had to teach her not to open it and stuff

02:58:04.700 --> 02:58:10.260
But because of the whole situation it took me like months to teach her not to do it or touch it or whatever

02:58:11.220 --> 02:58:17.260
When she started doing it and leaving it closed. I thought that she was cleaning it out and

02:58:17.980 --> 02:58:20.020
I would forget about it

02:58:20.940 --> 02:58:25.260
I would completely forget about it. So I'd leave it in there for like days

02:58:27.060 --> 02:58:29.060
Until it was time for me to use it again

02:58:31.380 --> 02:58:33.700
So the rice was still in the collecting mold

02:58:46.780 --> 02:58:49.820
So yeah, I would forget about it being in there

02:58:50.140 --> 02:58:52.140
and then I would collect mold

02:58:56.340 --> 02:59:00.340
But it's different if the rice cooker belonged to me and only me

02:59:00.340 --> 02:59:05.340
I'd freely be able to eat out of it save food and I have to worry about people touching it

02:59:05.340 --> 02:59:11.020
If no one's touching it then I can I will know when something's in it and when something isn't in it

02:59:11.580 --> 02:59:13.580
And I would solely clean it myself

02:59:20.420 --> 02:59:23.900
It was just really annoying because she would like

02:59:25.500 --> 02:59:27.500
She would like take a picture

02:59:28.220 --> 02:59:32.260
Send it to me, but like hey look it's moldy

02:59:33.900 --> 02:59:39.140
Am I okay? Right? I'm gonna clean it. Clean it

02:59:41.500 --> 02:59:44.540
And she just keep doing that over and over

02:59:44.940 --> 02:59:51.260
Even if someone else used it, I had to clean it. So it was annoying. It was very annoying

03:00:00.580 --> 03:00:09.760
To constantly be annoyed by it my brain just automatically like just no longer cared about it anymore

03:00:10.200 --> 03:00:12.200
I

03:00:12.480 --> 03:00:14.480
Stressed out over a rice cooker

03:00:18.320 --> 03:00:24.360
I was like I'll forget about it. I just won't eat rice won't make my own rice anymore

03:00:26.760 --> 03:00:29.640
After a rice is good for fried white rice, it's true

03:00:40.400 --> 03:00:42.900
I'm right so bad

03:00:49.680 --> 03:00:51.680
You met a cereal by the way

03:01:00.160 --> 03:01:06.560
You had fried chicken and fried rice for dinner nice. I only had fried chicken, but it wasn't for dinner

03:01:07.280 --> 03:01:08.880
sadly

03:01:08.880 --> 03:01:10.880
It was for lunch

03:01:13.920 --> 03:01:15.920
My mom made it before she left

03:01:25.560 --> 03:01:32.560
Excuse me to talk about rice. Rice is amazing. What? You don't have time to talk about rice

03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:40.880
I

03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:53.600
Don't realize

03:02:08.960 --> 03:02:12.120
I think the most food traumatizing thing

03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:18.020
That my mom did was forced me to eat mushrooms. It's one of the reasons why I don't like mushrooms

03:02:18.520 --> 03:02:20.880
I'm a little traumatized from mushrooms

03:02:23.240 --> 03:02:25.240
So I really don't like mushrooms

03:02:26.560 --> 03:02:30.360
She would make us eat it we were broke II so she would force us to eat

03:02:32.240 --> 03:02:35.400
One thing she'd would make was you know spaghetti and meatballs

03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:41.480
Spaghetti and meatballs minus the meatball replace it with mushrooms

03:02:42.920 --> 03:02:44.920
She'd make that all the time

03:02:47.280 --> 03:02:51.400
All the time and I can't I can't I can't no

03:02:52.680 --> 03:02:54.680
No

03:03:05.400 --> 03:03:07.400
Oh

03:03:18.440 --> 03:03:23.000
She would get so angry we wouldn't finish our food she'd make us stay up at the table

03:03:23.640 --> 03:03:28.360
We have to sit there and she was like you can't leave you can't go to bed unless you finish this

03:03:29.080 --> 03:03:34.760
Me and my my siblings

03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:41.800
We were such bad children ah

03:03:45.560 --> 03:03:50.000
We would find multiple ways to dispose of the evidence

03:03:58.600 --> 03:04:00.600
Oh

03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:20.680
No, we chuck it chuck it out the window we hide it we'll flush it

03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:30.360
So bad

03:04:48.360 --> 03:04:50.360
Oh man

03:04:50.360 --> 03:04:52.360
Oh

03:04:59.800 --> 03:05:05.400
We used to be such food wasters things changed after that

03:05:08.120 --> 03:05:10.120
Things changed so much

03:05:12.680 --> 03:05:15.080
I remember being um

03:05:15.160 --> 03:05:22.120
We were like I experienced true starvation for the first time

03:05:22.840 --> 03:05:24.840
We were homeless for a little bit

03:05:25.560 --> 03:05:27.560
For a little bit we were homeless

03:05:28.120 --> 03:05:29.400
Yeah

03:05:29.400 --> 03:05:31.400
Yeah, like a big dead

03:05:31.720 --> 03:05:33.720
We're homeless

03:05:33.800 --> 03:05:35.800
I've been homeless before

03:05:35.880 --> 03:05:37.160
So I know

03:05:37.160 --> 03:05:39.160
I'm gonna have a big tail and

03:05:39.640 --> 03:05:41.640
We won't eat for

03:05:42.200 --> 03:05:43.960
For so long

03:05:44.040 --> 03:05:46.040
And all I would eat was bread

03:05:46.040 --> 03:05:49.400
Bread bread. I love bread. It's my savior

03:05:51.240 --> 03:05:53.240
Uh

03:05:53.480 --> 03:05:58.600
I felt so bad about how much food I wasted in the past

03:06:01.800 --> 03:06:03.800
Makes you really think

03:06:08.280 --> 03:06:10.680
I'm not out of the clear water yet

03:06:11.640 --> 03:06:14.200
I'm barely hanging on with rent

03:06:17.080 --> 03:06:19.080
We're barely hanging on

03:06:21.480 --> 03:06:24.360
But hopefully you're hopefully it won't happen again

03:06:26.120 --> 03:06:28.120
We're fine now

03:06:28.600 --> 03:06:30.600
For now

03:06:30.600 --> 03:06:32.600
I

03:06:39.240 --> 03:06:45.400
Thank you appreciate that. That's very sweet of you to say about my love. Thank you

03:06:50.520 --> 03:06:53.480
They were chopped mushrooms by the way

03:07:00.840 --> 03:07:07.000
Is it a flavor thing or texture thing? No, it's just trauma. I think it's just trauma

03:07:08.920 --> 03:07:10.920
Uh mental mental thing

03:07:13.400 --> 03:07:18.040
I get really nauseous whenever I try to eat a mushroom every now and then

03:07:19.960 --> 03:07:24.760
They're really nauseous even if I eat it and I don't know what's a mushroom. It's like

03:07:25.800 --> 03:07:28.120
It's like a taste you can't really forget

03:07:30.840 --> 03:07:32.840
So I think it's just a mental thing

03:07:33.800 --> 03:07:38.600
Same goes for raisins. I used to really like raisins a lot growing up

03:07:39.320 --> 03:07:41.320
but again trauma

03:07:41.800 --> 03:07:48.680
My grandma my grandma's house when I stayed with her she had a mice and stuff and

03:07:49.400 --> 03:07:51.400
bugs infestation and

03:07:52.920 --> 03:07:54.920
Wasn't like extremely bad, but

03:07:57.160 --> 03:07:59.160
Her food was not safe

03:08:00.040 --> 03:08:01.880
um

03:08:01.880 --> 03:08:04.280
I think flies got into the

03:08:05.240 --> 03:08:06.600
raisins

03:08:06.600 --> 03:08:08.600
And I was eating them

03:08:08.920 --> 03:08:14.760
Eating the box of raisins. It's just enjoying them. Hmm raisins. Yum. Yum. Yum. So good. Hmm

03:08:15.640 --> 03:08:18.360
And then I poured out the last little bit into my hand

03:08:19.400 --> 03:08:23.640
And there were about four maggots in my hand

03:08:23.880 --> 03:08:25.880
And

03:08:27.400 --> 03:08:29.400
Swiggling about in my hand

03:08:31.480 --> 03:08:33.480
And ever since then I never ate raisins

03:08:54.520 --> 03:08:59.080
You let an interesting life, I guess I suppose so

03:09:01.480 --> 03:09:03.480
I've been through quite a lot

03:09:23.880 --> 03:09:25.880
I

03:09:31.320 --> 03:09:35.560
Have like so many stories I can tell you guys I have I have

03:09:36.280 --> 03:09:39.320
I've been through quite a bit and they're very memorable

03:09:40.440 --> 03:09:42.440
I remember stuff when I was five

03:09:43.240 --> 03:09:48.200
I was five years old. I remember stuff way back then a lot of memories

03:09:49.160 --> 03:09:54.600
I remember it's pretty good when it comes to remembering the really really good and the really really bad

03:09:56.520 --> 03:09:58.520
But it's not good for much anything else

03:10:00.840 --> 03:10:04.360
It has to have a stain on my brain for me to remember

03:10:04.440 --> 03:10:06.440
I

03:10:13.240 --> 03:10:18.200
Give me the elevator perch for your weirdest stories mention them speaking of elevators

03:10:20.760 --> 03:10:26.520
Speaking of elevators, I have a bunch of elevator story for you

03:10:34.920 --> 03:10:36.920
I

03:10:42.520 --> 03:10:49.880
Didn't get stuck in an elevator that's old news. Come on. Everybody has had had gone. They had been stuck. Wow

03:10:53.080 --> 03:10:55.080
Wow

03:10:55.560 --> 03:10:57.560
Wow

03:10:57.960 --> 03:11:03.240
English English is great

03:11:06.840 --> 03:11:11.240
Everyone's gone stuck in an elevator at least once at least once

03:11:13.800 --> 03:11:15.800
I got stuck in an elevator twice

03:11:17.480 --> 03:11:19.480
twice

03:11:20.760 --> 03:11:23.160
I was really really really young when the first time it happened

03:11:23.880 --> 03:11:29.400
And there was a blackout and the elevator stopped working the blackout in the building and the elevator stopped working

03:11:30.440 --> 03:11:34.040
So it was dark in the elevator. I remember being in an elevator with other people

03:11:34.120 --> 03:11:39.160
I didn't really know what was happening. I was confused. So I was like, what's happening? Why is it so dark? And then

03:11:40.440 --> 03:11:42.440
I was in an elevator with like a

03:11:43.240 --> 03:11:46.440
family member and they were screaming at the top foot there

03:11:46.520 --> 03:11:53.640
And that is what scared me. I'm actually really terrified of the dark and terrified of elevators

03:11:55.240 --> 03:12:03.480
All right, let me put on details more details. It's not just elevators. I'm afraid of I'm afraid of man-made machinery

03:12:06.840 --> 03:12:14.120
Man-made machinery that can and will mount function as what I'm afraid of I have a fear of machines

03:12:16.520 --> 03:12:19.720
But I have no other choice but to use them. So I tough through it

03:12:20.200 --> 03:12:24.120
I tough through it. I'm also claustrophobic. So yeah

03:12:27.320 --> 03:12:29.320
Yes, I'm scared of escalators as well

03:12:29.960 --> 03:12:34.440
I get shaky knees when I'm on them, but I have no other choice. I'm also afraid of planes

03:12:35.160 --> 03:12:36.920
I'm afraid of planes

03:12:36.920 --> 03:12:38.600
I'm not

03:12:38.600 --> 03:12:40.440
super afraid of cars

03:12:40.440 --> 03:12:42.440
But I I do

03:12:43.400 --> 03:12:49.240
Get really really sick. I don't know if it's motion sickness, but I doubt it because I've been on a boat

03:12:50.280 --> 03:12:55.880
I don't think it's motion sickness. I think I just get car sick the smell of the car

03:12:56.520 --> 03:13:00.120
Being in it feeling closed off

03:13:01.560 --> 03:13:03.560
I uh

03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:07.000
Oh, I'm sorry give me a second

03:13:08.280 --> 03:13:09.720
Wow

03:13:09.720 --> 03:13:11.720
Even thinking about it makes me freak out

03:13:13.080 --> 03:13:14.520
a little

03:13:14.520 --> 03:13:19.240
Panic attack and then I uh, I get really nauseous and I really massive headache

03:13:20.520 --> 03:13:22.520
Massive really big

03:13:24.200 --> 03:13:27.240
So the only way I could ride in a car is if I uh

03:13:34.920 --> 03:13:36.920
If I have a window open

03:13:36.920 --> 03:13:38.920
I

03:13:40.440 --> 03:13:42.600
But I tough through it usually I don't say anything

03:13:42.600 --> 03:13:47.400
I sit in the car really quietly and I like lean my head against the door and I don't say anything

03:13:48.120 --> 03:13:52.520
I don't want no one to worry or freak out and stuff the last time I brought it up to

03:13:52.920 --> 03:13:57.880
It was like I was in a cab and the person in the cab freaked out because I was like panicking

03:13:58.120 --> 03:14:02.840
I was like, please please can you open a window and they were like, it's cold. I was like, please please

03:14:03.080 --> 03:14:05.080
Please please please please and they were like

03:14:05.880 --> 03:14:08.680
And then I freaked out and then I freaked out and then we were freaking out

03:14:10.760 --> 03:14:12.760
So I just don't say anything

03:14:20.680 --> 03:14:26.440
I know what I don't want I don't want I don't want to freak out my hands are shaking. Oh my gosh

03:14:33.480 --> 03:14:37.640
And I think I've been in a near accident in a car before

03:14:38.120 --> 03:14:42.280
I've been in an accident twice, but the other one wasn't that bad, but I think it was like

03:14:43.160 --> 03:14:47.400
Uh, one of my family members kind of scared me

03:14:48.360 --> 03:14:50.680
They were like, oh, we got to be careful. We got to be careful

03:14:51.640 --> 03:14:56.920
We're all gonna be doomed and oh it's gonna be over and then she started doing a prayer and I was like, oh my god

03:14:57.080 --> 03:14:59.080
I'm going to die

03:14:59.080 --> 03:15:01.080
Oh

03:15:29.400 --> 03:15:31.400
Oh

03:15:42.200 --> 03:15:47.640
But yeah, I've been stuck at elevator a couple of times, but I think the funny elevator stories I have for you

03:15:48.040 --> 03:15:50.040
Don't have to really deal with these

03:15:50.040 --> 03:15:52.040
It's just

03:15:53.080 --> 03:15:55.080
Sorry

03:15:59.080 --> 03:16:02.280
It's not my story, but let me tell you

03:16:04.760 --> 03:16:06.760
About my mom

03:16:09.800 --> 03:16:12.200
I'm tearing up already

03:16:13.160 --> 03:16:20.600
So, you know, I I live in a in a place where you know bugs are a big problem

03:16:21.640 --> 03:16:24.760
And you know what kind of like bug is a really big problem

03:16:25.480 --> 03:16:27.480
You know, because they're kind of really big

03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:30.440
And gross

03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:33.320
And a creepy crawly, you know, they're big and gross

03:16:34.040 --> 03:16:35.640
We call them

03:16:35.640 --> 03:16:41.080
Waterbugs, but I know what a real water bug looks like. It's not really a water bug. It's just a giant

03:16:42.760 --> 03:16:44.760
Cockroach

03:16:45.400 --> 03:16:47.400
This is a really big one

03:16:48.120 --> 03:16:50.120
And you know

03:16:50.600 --> 03:16:56.840
You know, they're really not nice to be around. They're scary. They're big. They're massive

03:16:57.800 --> 03:17:01.000
No, it's like it's a cockroach cockroach

03:17:02.200 --> 03:17:07.000
Those those are not nice. Those are gross. They're gross and they're massive

03:17:12.840 --> 03:17:19.320
Well, my mom got into an elevator with a kind gentleman

03:17:23.080 --> 03:17:31.240
She got into the elevator with a kind gentleman and they were added up in the elevator

03:17:34.040 --> 03:17:36.280
And bam, there it was

03:17:37.160 --> 03:17:44.360
It was crawling about and my mom she really just

03:17:47.080 --> 03:17:52.200
She does not like insects. She does not like them at all not one bit

03:17:58.200 --> 03:18:05.560
And did you do you know a fun fact about cockroaches you want to know a fun fact

03:18:06.280 --> 03:18:08.280
You

03:18:25.560 --> 03:18:29.000
The cockroaches have this thing they can do

03:18:30.040 --> 03:18:33.400
Cockroaches have this really cool thing they can do

03:18:34.120 --> 03:18:36.120
Which is fly

03:18:36.600 --> 03:18:38.600
They can fly

03:18:54.360 --> 03:19:02.760
So this cockroach starts flying and it's flying everywhere and then she's stuck in this elevator with this kind gentleman

03:19:02.760 --> 03:19:09.320
And she sits flying and she's screaming and she's screaming

03:19:32.840 --> 03:19:41.400
And she starts clinging to this poor man

03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:50.520
She's holding him for dear life. She's clinging to him like a Scooby-Doo

03:20:03.320 --> 03:20:05.320
Oh

03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:25.000
Oh god

03:20:25.160 --> 03:20:27.160
Oh

03:20:28.680 --> 03:20:37.960
And you know what makes it better, you know what makes why I laugh so hard you want to know why I laugh so hard

03:20:45.720 --> 03:20:53.720
It's because I could hear everything I can hear I hear screaming

03:20:55.400 --> 03:20:57.400
Ah

03:21:06.920 --> 03:21:15.640
That's a lot she was screaming she was screaming so loud I can't hear everything she's in the elevator

03:21:17.080 --> 03:21:21.960
And she came out she said she was so embarrassed

03:21:21.960 --> 03:21:26.120
She was so embarrassed

03:21:28.680 --> 03:21:34.360
She said the guy didn't even react he didn't move he didn't even do anything. He just stood there

03:21:34.680 --> 03:21:38.040
She screamed at yourself hiding in it. Oh my god

03:21:39.640 --> 03:21:42.600
She said he didn't even react. He just stood there

03:21:52.680 --> 03:21:54.680
Oh

03:22:01.640 --> 03:22:06.520
Oh, it was the greatest. Oh, oh, it was amazing

03:22:16.200 --> 03:22:18.200
And you know

03:22:19.160 --> 03:22:23.880
You know, it's great. This is the first time this happened

03:22:25.800 --> 03:22:28.200
This also happened to another sibling of mine

03:22:29.560 --> 03:22:32.120
How it happened to my my sister

03:22:35.880 --> 03:22:39.720
She also got stuck in the elevator, but she was by herself this time

03:22:48.520 --> 03:22:50.520
And I also heard her too

03:23:03.320 --> 03:23:05.320
Ah

03:23:18.920 --> 03:23:20.920
Ah

03:23:32.840 --> 03:23:34.840
It was great

03:23:37.800 --> 03:23:39.800
Uh

03:23:40.440 --> 03:23:42.200
Wow

03:23:42.200 --> 03:23:45.160
I can't say that I haven't gone through

03:23:46.520 --> 03:23:53.160
I I haven't gone through what they went through being stuck in the elevator with one, but I've had a similar

03:23:54.200 --> 03:23:56.200
situation

03:23:57.800 --> 03:23:59.800
A similar situation

03:24:00.920 --> 03:24:03.080
When I still had my my cat

03:24:04.200 --> 03:24:05.240
Uh

03:24:05.240 --> 03:24:07.240
His name was kuro

03:24:07.480 --> 03:24:09.480
Uh, when I saw my cat kuro

03:24:11.160 --> 03:24:13.160
My throat holy water

03:24:13.560 --> 03:24:15.560
Water break

03:24:18.040 --> 03:24:20.040
I'm still laughing too much

03:24:25.880 --> 03:24:27.880
When I saw my cat

03:24:28.600 --> 03:24:31.080
He liked to hunt down bugs and stuff

03:24:32.840 --> 03:24:35.240
But one day I decided to take a bath

03:24:37.960 --> 03:24:41.480
I decided to take a bath a nice

03:24:42.840 --> 03:24:44.840
Relaxing bath

03:24:45.160 --> 03:24:50.200
I showered beforehand get the little muck off me first so I don't bathe in my own

03:24:51.080 --> 03:24:53.080
muck

03:24:53.400 --> 03:24:55.400
And

03:24:56.040 --> 03:25:00.040
I I turned on the water I had candles lit for myself

03:25:00.200 --> 03:25:02.200
Oh

03:25:02.440 --> 03:25:04.600
It was the best and I was like

03:25:05.400 --> 03:25:09.960
I didn't even have a phone with me at some I don't think I I didn't have anything with me in there

03:25:10.840 --> 03:25:13.640
I was relaxing. It was so good

03:25:16.840 --> 03:25:24.600
And I laid there in the bath relaxing with the door cracked door was cracked

03:25:25.160 --> 03:25:31.480
Because my cat hates when I closed the door. He hated it. He did not like when I closed the door

03:25:31.560 --> 03:25:33.560
He would sit at the door scratching at it. Meow

03:25:34.280 --> 03:25:35.800
Meow

03:25:35.800 --> 03:25:37.640

Open the door

03:25:50.600 --> 03:25:52.600
Meow

03:25:53.640 --> 03:25:55.640
He hated it so I had a door cracked

03:25:59.560 --> 03:26:06.200
And he started shuffling about doing I thought he had the zoomies or something and he was like running back for it

03:26:07.640 --> 03:26:09.640
And and then he comes through the cat

03:26:09.800 --> 03:26:11.320
I got a door and just

03:26:11.320 --> 03:26:15.640
Barges in and then he's like at the corner of the tub and the wall

03:26:16.600 --> 03:26:18.600
like

03:26:18.600 --> 03:26:21.880
And I'm like, what are you doing silly? What are you doing?

03:26:23.240 --> 03:26:25.240
What are you doing?

03:26:25.480 --> 03:26:27.720
You're a silly cat. You're so silly

03:26:29.320 --> 03:26:33.160
Is something there? What are you doing? Is it just is it a small bug?

03:26:34.440 --> 03:26:36.760
I'll kill it. I'll get the small bug

03:26:38.200 --> 03:26:40.440

03:27:21.960 --> 03:27:23.960

My mom my mom comes out yells at me. Why am I screaming? Why are you screaming?

03:27:32.440 --> 03:27:36.440
She's angry at me for screaming later at night. Why are you screaming? Why are you screaming?

03:27:36.440 --> 03:27:38.600
And I'm like get it get it get it

03:27:38.680 --> 03:27:40.680
She looks down and she's like

03:27:40.680 --> 03:27:42.680
Oh

03:27:51.720 --> 03:27:53.720
Yeah

03:28:05.400 --> 03:28:07.400
We had a

03:28:07.400 --> 03:28:12.600
Cockroaches incident in a while. It's been a couple of years now. This was so long ago

03:28:14.200 --> 03:28:15.880
It's a while now

03:28:15.880 --> 03:28:17.880
They clean it up now

03:28:17.880 --> 03:28:19.880
We haven't had an incident in a while

03:28:20.840 --> 03:28:22.840
This is good

03:28:27.080 --> 03:28:31.480
I don't mind the small ones the small ones are fine like I'm I'm murder those

03:28:33.880 --> 03:28:37.080
Die die evens die

03:28:41.560 --> 03:28:43.560
But the big ones

03:28:49.880 --> 03:28:53.960
Because then what are you going to do like how are you going how you going to murder it?

03:28:54.440 --> 03:28:56.440
We shoot like

03:28:56.840 --> 03:28:59.000
Oh, like it's going to go crunch

03:28:59.800 --> 03:29:01.800
Squelch and pop like

03:29:04.360 --> 03:29:13.400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

03:29:20.840 --> 03:29:22.840
I

03:29:24.600 --> 03:29:29.560
Hate mosquitoes hate them with a burning passion. I suffer to them every day

03:29:30.760 --> 03:29:36.200
But because of this fan, I haven't had a mosquito problem in a minute. Thanks

03:29:37.960 --> 03:29:43.100
They they they they are annoying. I hate when they buzz in your ear

03:29:50.360 --> 03:29:52.360
He

03:30:00.600 --> 03:30:02.600
Hate mosquitoes

03:30:04.440 --> 03:30:05.960
I like

03:30:05.960 --> 03:30:11.960
Some spiders, but I'm actually really scared of spiders, but I think some of them are really cute

03:30:12.520 --> 03:30:17.400
I think jumping spiders and tarantulas are the cutest things that they're so fuzzy so dangerous

03:30:17.720 --> 03:30:19.720
But so fuzzy and cute

03:30:21.160 --> 03:30:25.960
Look at that. So cute. I like jumping spiders. I think the big beady eyes are as little

03:30:28.600 --> 03:30:30.600
Big eyes

03:30:31.320 --> 03:30:33.320
They're really cute

03:30:34.120 --> 03:30:36.120
But I am still scared of

03:30:36.120 --> 03:30:41.320
Spiders I leave the house spiders alone. I used to have a spider friend in the corner of my room

03:30:41.320 --> 03:30:43.320
But I haven't seen it in a while

03:30:44.280 --> 03:30:48.520
Um, it usually like disappears for a few days and then comes back in the same corner

03:30:49.000 --> 03:30:51.480
But it's been gone for like two weeks now

03:30:52.840 --> 03:30:55.320
Probably moved on to new endeavors

03:31:01.080 --> 03:31:05.000
But I had spider scares where a spider would appear in my showers

03:31:05.960 --> 03:31:10.600
Like uh fall down. I've had a spear fear of spiders for a while

03:31:13.480 --> 03:31:15.480
And

03:31:34.920 --> 03:31:38.920
Yeah, I usually take them out of the house too and put them out in the window

03:31:39.400 --> 03:31:41.400
Yeah, go away little spider

03:31:42.360 --> 03:31:44.360
Goodbye

03:31:44.760 --> 03:31:49.800
But I don't do it. I get someone else to do it because I'm not gonna do it. I'm not going nowhere near one

03:31:53.240 --> 03:31:57.320
Same goes for fireflies. I'm just really I just don't I'm not a big bug person

03:31:58.200 --> 03:32:00.200
I'm not a big bug person

03:32:02.840 --> 03:32:10.840
Like I like fireflies they look so pretty and I'm sure they're very they're harmless, but they're terrifying

03:32:12.360 --> 03:32:14.360
They move around so much

03:32:35.160 --> 03:32:38.840
I think spiders are fine though. I really like snakes and all those stuff

03:32:39.240 --> 03:32:41.960
But the fire is okay some of them

03:32:43.240 --> 03:32:45.240
If they look scary, I don't like them

03:32:45.800 --> 03:32:52.760
But if they look big like they're cute and fuzzy and stuff, then that's fine. I like those the big fuzzy big fuzzy ones

03:32:54.120 --> 03:32:56.120
I think those are cute

03:32:56.120 --> 03:32:58.120
You

03:33:03.560 --> 03:33:08.680
Would not believe your eyes is 10 million fireflies lit up the world

03:33:18.680 --> 03:33:20.680
Stare

03:33:26.120 --> 03:33:28.120
I

03:33:35.720 --> 03:33:43.400
Fireflies big some depends there's multiple different types of fireflies and the ones over here pretty pretty fucking big

03:33:44.360 --> 03:33:47.320
But I think they're like going extinct over here

03:33:48.200 --> 03:33:51.400
Haven't really had many for the last couple of years

03:33:53.000 --> 03:33:55.000
Yeah, they kind of like show up and then

03:33:56.120 --> 03:33:58.120
Be no more

03:33:59.880 --> 03:34:01.880
There's less and less every year

03:34:17.880 --> 03:34:19.880
I make my stomach hurt

03:34:20.600 --> 03:34:22.600
Oh

03:34:24.280 --> 03:34:28.920
Road-sized fireflies. Oh my stomach

03:34:32.200 --> 03:34:34.600
No, please no, no

03:34:45.400 --> 03:34:49.000
We had a nice chat today. It was a nice chatting

03:34:50.200 --> 03:34:52.200
You guys are pretty chill

03:35:00.040 --> 03:35:05.240
Yeah, yeah, there's a little behaved but you're good boys and girls in here

03:35:05.960 --> 03:35:07.960
Ah

03:35:16.200 --> 03:35:22.280
My throat is starting to hurt. I don't remember if I took my medication if I'm honest

03:35:25.160 --> 03:35:32.200
I mentioned my alarm and then I mentioned my medication, but I do not remember if I took it

03:35:35.400 --> 03:35:37.400
I

03:35:43.000 --> 03:35:45.000
Can't take the

03:35:49.960 --> 03:35:52.440
I can't take the heart medication because I did drink

03:35:53.880 --> 03:35:59.400
And I'm uh, I don't want to take chances. So we're not going to take that for today. It's okay to miss a day

03:36:00.360 --> 03:36:02.360
It's perfectly fine. I miss a day, but the

03:36:03.480 --> 03:36:07.080
Pankillers I need it would make if I didn't take my

03:36:07.800 --> 03:36:12.040
If I didn't take the painkillers, it would make sense why I have a massive like

03:36:13.000 --> 03:36:15.000
The robbing like headache on a side

03:36:29.880 --> 03:36:31.880
I

03:36:33.560 --> 03:36:35.560
Feel like I did

03:36:36.680 --> 03:36:38.680
That's a myth

03:36:39.320 --> 03:36:41.320
I remember taking something

03:36:42.280 --> 03:36:44.280
I remember taking something

03:36:45.160 --> 03:36:47.160
I think I did

03:36:48.280 --> 03:36:54.280
I think I did I did I did I 100% did I did

03:37:00.120 --> 03:37:02.120
I

03:37:03.960 --> 03:37:08.600
Did not take my inhaler though that I did not take that's for sure

03:37:12.280 --> 03:37:15.960
I think I did take it immediately. I have my memory is just so bad

03:37:30.280 --> 03:37:38.120
And I don't need to take my nasal spray today. I took it earlier in the day because I was having those problems earlier

03:37:42.040 --> 03:37:45.400
That's it, you know, I think I'm good. I think it's fine. Yeah

03:37:45.400 --> 03:37:47.400
Yeah

03:37:53.800 --> 03:37:55.800
