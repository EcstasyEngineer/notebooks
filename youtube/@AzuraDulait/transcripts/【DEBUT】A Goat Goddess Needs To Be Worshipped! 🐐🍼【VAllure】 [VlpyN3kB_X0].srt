1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

5
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

6
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

7
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You

8
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You

9
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You

10
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You

11
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You

12
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You

13
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You

14
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You

15
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You

16
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You

17
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You

18
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You

19
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You

20
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,840
Among the Divines, the sister Azura would colour the land's

21
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,000
Invertency, fill the blue oceans with life, and instill within these creations the potential

22
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,080
to grow and repopulate.

23
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:15,160
In her accomplishment, she would be known as the Goddess of Fertility.

24
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,280
In time, Azura's creations would grow in intellect and complexity.

25
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,280
In their scattered tribes, the gods took to guiding humanity with their superior knowledge.

26
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,520
In this exchange, humanity gave them worship and devotion, the gods which shaped the foundations

27
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:39,280
of human civilization across the lands in each celebrating their divine benefactor.

28
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,280
The gods, confident that mankind could stand on their own, sought to create the heavens,

29
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,040
a place where the gods could raise families of their own kind, as Earth was no space for

30
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,540
them to grow.

31
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,840
They rightfully seeked the same prosperity that they offered for their own and loved.

32
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,400
Out of all the gods, it was Azura who could not leave humanity.

33
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,200
She loved her creations, yet she also loved the gods.

34
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,080
She left a piece of her divinity with her family in remembrance and remained on Earth

35
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:22,640
to live among humanity, not as a ruler, but as a watcher and caretaker.

36
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,680
It would be after the gods' departure that the long peace would end.

37
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,880
With the imbalance of power, wars between the regions could not be prevented.

38
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:41,000
Anger, strife, and hunger for power would taint the ego of man, and Azura's limited

39
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,040
power could not restore the will of the gods that left behind for humanity.

40
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,600
In her perceived failure, Azura would seemingly disappear from the walks of history.

41
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,800
It has been long theorized that the goddess still lives amongst us in secret.

42
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,720
There has been a long time speculation that throughout history, Azura has been guiding

43
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,960
humanity in small leadership roles, humanitarian efforts in philanthropy, or using her power

44
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,800
to prevent cataclysmic disasters.

45
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,400
Wherever she is, we can all rest easy that she is watching over us from a position befitting

46
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,040
a goddess among men.

47
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,760
Well, Billy, I think we all learned an important lesson here today.

48
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,240
That's right, Papa. Whatever happens, we're all family.

49
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,080
That's exactly right, Billy, and there's nothing more important than family.

50
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,800
Aw, Shucks, I'm so happy I have such a big, happy loving family.

51
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,080
I'd be such a sucker if I didn't have a family.

52
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Aw, Billy.

53
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:07,040
It has been a few years since I came to the realization that I could no longer outrun

54
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,840
the reach of mankind.

55
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,640
Living among animals, I tried to run from civilization for as long as time would allow.

56
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:21,960
I am content to play the role of a commoner among humanity, yet I am tortured still by

57
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,600
loneliness, by desires.

58
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,000
I cannot fight my needs anymore.

59
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,760
I must find my place among the humans and start a family.

60
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:41,840
In my inaugural efforts to integrate into modern society, it became clear that I lack

61
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,800
the necessary knowledge to fraternize as humans do.

62
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:54,440
With animals, it's so simple, yet with humans, my knowledge avails me no aid.

63
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,240
Again and again, I accumulated countless attempts at courting a suitable mate.

64
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,560
How could I, before my goddess of fertility, struggle in his venture?

65
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,240
Yet seeing the progress humanity has earned themselves, astonishes me.

66
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,600
They have become creators in themselves, expanding upon the earth we had given them.

67
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,920
The tiny seed I had planted all those eons ago, well how it blossomed.

68
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,600
I had believed my heart broken beyond repair, but living as they do, I see now that they

69
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,360
don't need the wills of higher beings to find their own happiness.

70
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,280
Perhaps this in itself was the will of the gods.

71
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:46,600
I see now the beauty in the human spirit, for all its ugliness and evil, but also in

72
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,720
its kindness and community.

73
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,240
It is the dichotomy of these aspects that makes them worthy of my love.

74
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,400
I only regret not growing alongside them.

75
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,560
I must make up for lost time, for every kindling of my passion.

76
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,960
I have found I have endless love to give, and give it I shall.

77
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:26,640
Any takers?

78
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,800
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

79
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,800
I am Azura.

80
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:50,560
I bet you feel like devoting yourself to me now, don't you?

81
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,040
Oh, you just came back from an ISE concert?

82
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,520
Did you have fun?

83
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:08,560
My eyes are up here.

84
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,720
I suppose I don't mind you taking a peek.

85
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:21,160
After all, I do have two rather big personalities, wouldn't you say?

86
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:28,720
Oh, you'd make such a perfect servant for me.

87
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,480
Aren't you convinced to serve me at just a glance?

88
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,640
Ah, fine.

89
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,320
If I have to convince you, then it's okay.

90
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,480
Why don't I tell you about myself first?

91
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Wah!

92
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,720
It's me.

93
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,720
Hi.

94
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,720
I hope you enjoyed the crazy concert from ISE,

95
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,720
because now it's time to relax and vibe with me.

96
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:36,720
My name is Azura Doulay, pronounced Doulay.

97
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Azura for blue and Doulay, which is French for of milk.

98
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,720
So, blue milk.

99
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,720
I bet you're wondering why blue.

100
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,720
Well, because I'm blue.

101
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,720
As for milk, I wonder.

102
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,720
My day of creation is the 21st of August,

103
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,720
which also happens to be National Gold Day.

104
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,720
What are the odds?

105
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,720
You want to know my age?

106
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,720
Well, a goddess lives for so many human years.

107
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
It's hard to keep up.

108
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,720
I've long forgotten.

109
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Oh, you're also wondering what type of goddess I am?

110
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,720
I am a goat goddess.

111
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,720
And I've been around for eons.

112
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Did you know goats bring fertility to the land,

113
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,720
and that's exactly what I did to get you here?

114
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:03,720
I am also 185 centimeters, while around adorable humans like yourself.

115
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:11,720
But the truth is, this isn't the biggest I can get.

116
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,720
I can be as tall as a skyscraper.

117
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:24,720
But doing that right now wouldn't be so wise.

118
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,720
I only have English listed because that is what I mainly speak,

119
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,720
but I am currently learning Japanese and Dutch.

120
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Who got hit all the more?

121
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Mina genki de, yate kureru toin de, takeru.

122
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Well, even goddesses have things they like and dislike.

123
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Here are mine.

124
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:07,720
I love to pamper humans, which also involves nursing you,

125
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,720
while also praising you,

126
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:22,720
because I love seeing you flustered when I call you a good boy or a good girl.

127
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,720
And did it work?

128
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:32,720
You are so well-behaved, sitting through my debut.

129
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,720
I really like getting all cuddled up nice and warm together,

130
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,720
and foot massages too, but sometimes it tickles.

131
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,720
So let's not get too carried away.

132
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,720
I do love exotic pets.

133
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,720
I think they're very cute and unique.

134
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:01,720
I mean, like raccoons, ferrets, axolotls, even snakes and fuzzy spiders too.

135
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Well, I'm sure some of you are going to be very rebellious,

136
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,720
and that's just how some humans are, but why disobey me?

137
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Wouldn't it be nice to feel my warm embrace rather than be scolded by me?

138
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:31,720
And for those who do not listen, are called stinkers.

139
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:38,720
So if you don't want to be one, behave.

140
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Next are pickles.

141
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,720
They are disgusting.

142
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,720
Only went on a burger though.

143
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,720
I wouldn't mind sucking on them alone.

144
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:59,720
But I don't think they taste great with anything else.

145
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,720
And you see, well, I wouldn't be able to present myself in front of you

146
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,720
without the help of some incredibly creative people.

147
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Thank you all so so much for all your hard work and dedication to our creation.

148
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
Thank you, Mama.

149
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
Thank you, Papa.

150
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
And thank you, everyone else.

151
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,720
I truly appreciate you.

152
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Oh, and I can't wait to tell you about my interests.

153
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,720
I'm a huge anime fan, and I'm not picky either.

154
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:54,720
I have watched over thousands of anime, love, comedy, adventure, action,

155
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,720
and especially a good revenge story.

156
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:06,720
My all-time favorite, it's Tsukumichi Moonlight Fantasy.

157
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:16,720
The ancient Magus Bride, and the world god only knows.

158
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,720
As for games, the relaxed and chill ones are my go-to most of the time,

159
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:30,720
but I don't shy away from kicking some butt now and then.

160
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,720
All my topics are Minecraft, starting Valley, and League.

161
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,720
I mean, The Sims! The Sims!

162
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,720
Yeah!

163
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,720
I've also got so many great things on my mind,

164
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,720
but here are some of my goals.

165
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,720
I can't wait to achieve with you all.

166
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Like, reading bedtime stories so you can get the best sleep,

167
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,720
but play all yours and my favorite games,

168
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,720
grow a big loving community,

169
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:26,720
and I absolutely can't wait to fulfill your requests for all kinds of ASMRs.

170
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:34,720
For the more exclusive ASMRs, you'll find them over on the Patreon.

171
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Not to mention, I would love to collaborate with other amazing creators.

172
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Workout streams as an ASMR are something I'm very interested in,

173
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,720
and I can't wait to try out with you all.

174
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,720
Let's get fit together.

175
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,720
And last but definitely not least,

176
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:12,720
making so many precious memories with all of you.

177
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,720
And here are my tags.

178
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Tags haven't been decided yet,

179
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,720
but I was hoping that we could all come up with some,

180
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,720
which we will do in 2.0.

181
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,720
So far, we have, of course, our June tag indulge,

182
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,720
our art tag Azul Arts,

183
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,720
for all your favorite works devoted to me,

184
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,720
and our NSW tag Azul Leagues

185
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:50,720
for the more spicier works of art, or mentions.

186
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,720
Some ideas for tags are live Azul Live,

187
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,720
the clips Daily Delay,

188
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:10,720
and the memes are Azul Meme or Delay Last.

189
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Since we are limited in time, I do hope you understand,

190
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:28,720
so please help me come up with the rest in 2.0, okay?

191
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,720
Here would be our fandom,

192
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,720
but we have now is Bleeding Hearts.

193
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,720
If you guys have other ideas, I'd love to hear them in 2.0.

194
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,720
As for my Oshimarks, it is a goat emoji,

195
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,720
because, you know, I'm the goat.

196
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,720
The milk bottle emoji to represent you guys,

197
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,720
my little babes.

198
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Azul, look at our mascot!

199
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
Aren't they so cute?

200
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:15,720
They're big ears and absorb a little face and fits you.

201
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,720
Oh, let me tell you about my genmets.

202
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,720
First, there is Meme, very creative.

203
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,720
The things I've seen her do are out of this world,

204
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,720
yet she's also a funny little oddball,

205
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,720
and sometimes surprisingly chill.

206
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,720
However, I'm really worried about what you'll do with that hammer.

207
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,720
I see. I love this cute roll of love,

208
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,720
but I swear she has a menace to food.

209
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Some of her old food combinations are insane and traumatized me.

210
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,720
I really love her big claws, though.

211
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,720
And she be.

212
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:18,720
She's so funny and says the wildest jokes that really catch me off guard.

213
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,720
Her extremely high energy pulls you in,

214
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,720
and I can see her getting into trouble a lot.

215
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,720
And she's definitely the biggest yapper.

216
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:40,720
Her ears look so soft, and I want to stroke them.

217
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,720
Then there's Mercy.

218
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,720
She's the most adorable thing I've met.

219
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,720
So sweet.

220
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,720
So yummy.

221
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,720
And last but not least, Strony.

222
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,720
I truly hard-working fish,

223
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,720
but I sometimes worry about how much rest she's been getting.

224
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:23,720
Maybe I'll help her out and relieve some stress.

225
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,720
I love all my gen mates very, very much.

226
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Now come, let's head over to my room.

227
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Welcome to my room.

228
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,720
Feel free to have a look around.

229
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,720
Isn't it spacious?

230
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,720
As all the things I need and like.

231
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,720
A great view from the balcony.

232
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,720
Watch yourself up there, though.

233
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,720
You might fall.

234
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,720
There is a big comfy bed with lots of pillows.

235
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,720
Good for many things, yeah?

236
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Food to snack on.

237
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,720
And my personal favorite, a large, steaming hot bath.

238
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,720
It's perfect for relaxing after a long day,

239
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,720
and it has my favorite scent, lavender.

240
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,720
Oh, me?

241
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,720
I'm wearing only what I need to.

242
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,720
Too many clothes, just getting the way.

243
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:54,720
It might not be much, but it's made from the best material around.

244
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,720
Of course, I like to decorate my hair.

245
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Just look.

246
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,720
My horns are no exception.

247
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Aren't they pretty?

248
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,720
I'm a big fan of jewels, you know.

249
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,720
Oh, and how could I forget my rings?

250
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,720
That's right.

251
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,720
Toe rings.

252
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Are they just wonderful?

253
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,720
I hope you like my looks.

254
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,720
But that's not all.

255
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:49,720
I'm very ex-brushes, goddess.

256
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,720
You know, you'll get to see my...

257
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:05,720
little face.

258
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:14,720
My angry face.

259
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:23,720
My dark face.

260
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:32,720
When I cry.

261
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:39,720
When I'm shocked.

262
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:52,720
And when I sweat.

263
00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:01,720
My dead fish eyes.

264
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:17,720
And when I'm confused.

265
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:26,720
And when I'm blustered.

266
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:41,720
Or how about when I'm in love.

267
00:28:41,720 --> 00:29:10,720
Or even wanting more.

268
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,720
I hope all of you love...

269
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,720
of all of you love my beautiful expressions.

270
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,720
But one thing I never go anywhere without

271
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:31,720
is some emergency milk.

272
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:43,720
And some...

273
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:55,720
And here is my schedule for the week.

274
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,720
Tomorrow is debut 2.0.

275
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,720
And I'll share some of my more interesting things with you then.

276
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,720
Monday will play a place forbidden.

277
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:16,720
And then after a day of rest, I have my very first ASMR stream for you all.

278
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,720
Followed by one shot, some more one shot.

279
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,720
And then some relaxing supermarket simulator

280
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:43,720
where I'll sell my top tear milk.

281
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Wow, I'm getting a little sleepy.

282
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Sadly, that's all I've got time for my darlings.

283
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:07,720
But if you like and subscribe, you can get a whole lot more of me very soon.

284
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,720
The fun isn't over though.

285
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Because next we have Mercy to give you entertainment.

286
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,720
Just watch out though.

287
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,720
She's not as soft as me.

288
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,720
In fact, I would describe her as very...

289
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,720
Sharp.

290
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,720
So please stay a while as the read-it direct will take some time.

291
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,720
See you very soon, my lovelies.

292
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Bye bye!

293
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:44,720
Thank you for watching!
