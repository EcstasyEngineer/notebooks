322560	335560	And since I've been so busy lately, I haven't really been like sleeping for that amount of time, I just realized my headphones weren't even on.
342560	347560	My body just needs more sleep than the normal person.
353560	362560	Oh, this is a little tight on my chest, hang on.
365560	370560	Oops, oops, okay, sorry.
370560	382560	My apologies.
382560	385560	I was doing a little stretch.
385560	391560	Okay, so is this okay?
391560	394560	How's my volume, everyone?
394560	396560	It's my volume, okay?
396560	404560	Am I peaking for anyone? Let me know so that I can fix that.
404560	407560	I don't want to pee.
407560	411560	Wow, it's good.
411560	413560	I am fine.
413560	415560	Alright, it sounds good.
415560	417560	I'm fine, it's good.
417560	423560	I don't trust you guys who have me on speaker.
423560	431560	How are the headphone folks doing?
431560	435560	You can't tell on speaker.
435560	448560	That's what you all told me you didn't notice it last time.
448560	451560	They seem better because you're here.
451560	457560	Thank you Lazy today.
457560	461560	You've been waiting for your Oshis dreams.
461560	467560	But your Oshis is here now.
467560	472560	If you mean me, that is.
482560	488560	Thank you.
488560	493560	Thank you.
493560	499560	Thank you.
499560	507560	Thank you.
507560	513560	Thank you.
513560	515560	I'm sorry.
515560	518560	Ayane is contagious.
518560	532560	Ayane is contagious.
532560	542560	I'm not epi, I'm not epi, I swear, I swear.
542560	545560	So I have my audio, it's good.
545560	550560	And TV audio, I speak your audio.
550560	560560	Everything's good, that's good.
560560	562560	I'm not beating and sleeping.
562560	565560	I know what you mean.
565560	581560	I know what you mean.
581560	589560	I don't want to say.
589560	601560	I know everyone was looking forward to the work out ASMRs.
601560	603560	So was I.
603560	612560	But I had to let you guys know that I did get a big, big warning.
612560	615560	The last true.
616560	627560	So we might not be able to work out ASMRs.
627560	637560	As we did it in the last stream.
637560	644560	We might have to make some huge adjustments or just do some normal ASMR.
644560	648560	So I hope you're all okay with that.
648560	652560	Until we're safe to do so.
652560	655560	Until we're safe to do otherwise.
674560	687560	Yeah, the naughty cookie really did it for us.
687560	690560	It was the biggest morning.
690560	701560	So now we gotta be extra, extra careful.
701560	712560	Just don't eat so horribly.
712560	714560	I don't think that's possible.
714560	716560	I think we should just play it safe.
716560	718560	I don't want to take any chances.
718560	730560	As either I toy with it and then I can hit really hard and then I can't stream for a long time.
730560	736560	Or we toy around it.
736560	742560	And there's like a 20% chance it's okay.
742560	746560	I don't think we should take that chance.
746560	774560	As it's too strong for actually seemingly everything I do seems to be a little too much for the YouTubes.
774560	777560	Oh boy.
777560	794560	Hang.
794560	804560	Let me scoot in a little more.
804560	806560	My neck.
806560	809560	I think I slept so wrong.
809560	815560	My neck is killing me.
815560	819560	I look up in like the strangest position.
819560	823560	I have my arm like behind my neck like behind my head.
823560	826560	Like my left arm behind my head.
826560	828560	My leg was twisted.
828560	837560	I was like upside down like half on my back and half on like then my like front.
837560	846560	My ass was like slightly sticking up in the air.
846560	853560	I went to sleep as soon as I like ended a stream.
853560	858560	I fell asleep and then I woke up at like 4am.
858560	861560	I woke up at 4am to like use the bathroom.
861560	865560	I ate like a little more like leftovers.
865560	869560	And then I like I tried to go back to sleep.
869560	872560	I couldn't go back until like another two of hearts.
872560	879560	I woke up like maybe like an hour ago.
879560	908560	I don't know.
908560	923560	I was like leaning on my wall like half in the air.
923560	927560	I tried.
927560	929560	I tried to get some good sleep.
929560	931560	But it's hard.
931560	936560	So hard.
936560	957560	Why am I sleeping so hard?
957560	965560	Okay.
965560	967560	It's raining.
967560	970560	Everyone's now flooding in coming in.
970560	972560	Saying hello.
972560	974560	I'm learning.
974560	976560	How are you?
976560	978560	Afternoon.
978560	979560	Ow.
979560	981560	Ow.
981560	983560	Everything's crackling.
983560	985560	Crackling popping.
985560	986560	Ow.
986560	987560	My knee.
987560	992560	Ow.
992560	993560	I can't.
993560	994560	Ow.
994560	996560	My knee.
996560	1011560	I am fine.
1011560	1021560	I'm not sleeping.
1021560	1022560	I'm not sleeping.
1022560	1023560	I promise.
1023560	1024560	Oh.
1024560	1031560	I plan to have a thought through stream.
1032560	1041560	We're talking about my upcoming birthday event.
1041560	1044560	So I hope you all look forward to that.
1044560	1048560	Where I talk about my birthday coming up.
1048560	1055560	And I want to discuss what plans and things I want to do for it.
1055560	1058560	So I hope you're looking.
1058560	1060560	I'm not giving back.
1060560	1072560	I'm looking forward to that.
1072560	1076560	Love of day.
1076560	1079560	Yeah.
1079560	1084560	Because it's been like, a month and a half.

1489060	1491060	we should just jump into the game

1511060	1513060	you're back with pizza?
1514060	1517060	I want a pizza, what the fuck

1595060	1596060	what
1597060	1599060	just have it appear in front of me
1599060	1601060	ow, my fingers

1610060	1613060	this is what happens when you lose your powers
1613060	1615060	let's drop this
1629060	1631060	it is good to have a power idea
1631060	1633060	making pizza up here
1633060	1635060	out of the air
1647060	1651060	I'm a very, I'm a plain, I'm a plain pizza lover
1652060	1655060	I like just regular pizza with extra cheese
1655060	1658060	I'm just a cheese fanatic
1658060	1662060	and occasionally I'll get like Italian sausage on top
1662060	1664060	I really like pizza
1664060	1667060	but I really like plain pizza a lot
1667060	1669060	I'm so lame
1670060	1672060	so normal, so lame
1683060	1686060	I'm not a big fan of pineapple on pizza
1687060	1690060	I know there are people who like it
1690060	1692060	and I don't fault you
1692060	1694060	nor judge you
1694060	1696060	that's fine, you can like your pineapple on pizza

1902060	1904060	make me a pizza
1910060	1913060	never understood the hype behind anchovies on pizza
1917060	1919060	I don't like anchovies
1922060	1925060	I'm already hesitant on eating fish in general
1925060	1927060	so
1927060	1929060	I'm not fond of anchovies
1930060	1932060	but
1932060	1934060	I think the only time
1934060	1936060	is it anchovies
1936060	1940060	and it's fried anchovies
1940060	1942060	I think you eat it like
1942060	1945060	rice and Korean barbecue
1945060	1948060	they give you like fried anchovies or something
1949060	1951060	is it anchovies
1951060	1953060	I don't know
1953060	1955060	but I like that
1955060	1957060	it's like super sweet
1957060	1959060	dried fried
1959060	1961060	little fish
1961060	1963060	and it tastes really good
1963060	1965060	I'd eat it by itself
1965060	1967060	it's all crunchy
1967060	1969060	and it tastes super good with soju
1969060	1971060	soju and white rice
1977060	1979060	it depends on the dish
1979060	1981060	but if you give me like wet anchovy
1981060	1983060	I'm not going to eat it
1987060	1989060	I'm not going to eat it
1999060	2001060	do you like pizza pot or boneless

6986420	6988420	I think Momo has some pictures just like this.
6988420	6990420	Do you show it to him?

7080040	7094040	Our long-gone ancestors, the soft ones, left us the city. Our home is their legacy. A soft one.
7094040	7118040	Humans, our only ancestors can distinguish these colors. They said they once dominated the world.
7119040	7147040	The ancient stories speak of natural light that leaked from a star and landed at our feet.
7147040	7167040	This light caused warmth and well-being in our ancestors to help them grow.
7167040	7195040	Hello, I'm the merchant of the market.
7195040	7201040	You give me something, I'll give you something in exchange. It's as simple as that.
7202040	7211040	This is a set of electric cable, the vessel market. I'll exchange this for a super spirit.
7211040	7219040	Detergent? That's the best I can do.
7219040	7245040	This is a music sheet, a masterful piece of art. It will cost you one energy drink, I can't do less.
7245040	7258040	This is an ancient relic, a testament to the talent of our ancestors. It will cost you three energy drink cans, I can't do less.
7259040	7265040	I'll be back.
7265040	7281040	We're lethal, we're fortunate to have these items to help us defend against the Zerg. The Slums have its threats, and preparation is key.
7281040	7298040	We came across fake pictures like this sometimes. All talking about the outside. Beautiful dream, I guess.
7298040	7307040	Look at all the hidden gems in this trash, pennies from heaven or from somewhere anyway.
7307040	7311040	A blue sky, ha, imagine that.
7311040	7319040	I believe in the outside life, I wish to touch grass.
7341040	7351040	This is an ancient relic, a testament to the talent of our ancestors.
7371040	7373040	I'm cat.
7373040	7402040	We go. All the weird stuff always happens to you, mate. I don't dare to leave our village, it's too dangerous. Besides, the Guardian is the only one who can open this door.
7403040	7411040	That's a pretty picture, fake but pretty. Fake.
7411040	7421040	Zack, I left it in the streets, and the next day the Zergs had consumed it completely.
7421040	7426040	That's crazy, right? They can eat everything.
7426040	7434040	Another picture of the outside. Get out of here with that stuff, it's all nonsense.
7487040	7501040	This is an ancient relic, a testament to the talent of our ancestors.
7501040	7516040	Just jumping on random things, extreme cat-like behavior. Remember who you really are.
7516040	7520040	This is so fun, I like jumping on random things.
7532040	7545040	Music, shit. Come on.
7545040	7571040	This is a strange notebook with a symbol on it. This one seems to belong to someone named Clementine. Everything is going according to plan.
7572040	7587040	We managed to contact the upper level before the transceiver went down. They are in a place called Madown, and apparently it's controlled by some kind of oppressive force.
7587040	7598040	I talked to Momo earlier, his eyes. I know of this look. He will not come with us.
7598040	7605040	I don't know what this means, but it will probably be useful later.
7605040	7623040	We should go see that Momo person, who Guardian told us about.
7624040	7631040	I should have not done that. My nose hurts now.
7631040	7650040	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
7650040	7671040	I feel like we're going to play in the playing little cave big city. I think I saw that game before. I think I saw it. I actually really want to play that. That sounds fun.
7671040	7680040	What's up here? What's that? Give me. I want it.
7686040	7694040	Can I go up? Can I not go up? Oh, what's that?
7702040	7709040	What's that sound at the door? It's probably nothing.
7709040	7722040	Let me in.
7722040	7730040	I want to talk to everyone else back in the town.
7730040	7743040	Can I do that? There's so many things here. Oh my goodness, we got to be careful. Almost fell.
7743040	7759040	What's this?
7759040	7781040	It looks like this park I also wanted to go to the upper level. As I remember, the town is up there, away from all the garbage and sickness of the slums.
7781040	7794040	Sudden music scared me.
7794040	7812040	You can snap a sneeze by saying grip throat three times, can you? I'm going to try that.
7812040	7826040	Even at dire times, humans cannot help but divide themselves by social class. Back then, a lot of people from the slums were prepared to do anything to move up there.
7826040	7836040	Apparently robots also occupy this behavior.
7856040	7882040	You do look a little like a jerk. I'm far away at least. They look and sound cute, but don't be fooled. Those things chew through metal. Horrifying.
7883040	7894040	Oh, is that the outside when Momo keeps talking about? Music sheet, I don't play any instruments, sorry.
7894040	7909040	Oh yes, everyone around here knows the symbol, it's the outsiders. They live on the upper floors of this area. You can probably talk to Momo about this.
7909040	7911040	Oh wait.
7913040	7915040	That's that.
7922040	7927040	Man, this is just directions.
7940040	7955040	This was the road up there, I won't tell you.
7956020	7960300	Do you want other troublemakers playing with the paint buckets
7960300	7961020	on the real

8429720	8431720	I keep pressing the wrong button.
8431720	8432720	Hello?
8433720	8434720	Hello?
8436720	8437720	Hello?
8438720	8439720	Hello?
8440720	8441720	Can you hear me?
8442720	8444720	Can you hear me?
8445720	8446720	Hello?
8447720	8448720	Hello?
8453720	8454720	Hello?
8456720	8458720	Can you hear me?
8461720	8462720	Hello?
8464720	8465720	Hello?
8466720	8467720	Hello?
8468720	8469720	Hello?
8470720	8471720	Hello?
8471720	8472720	Hello?
8474720	8475720	Hello?
8482720	8485720	My PC just turned off on me.
8485720	8486720	It just said,
8488720	8490720	and everything turned off.
8490720	8493720	So I assume it was like an update.
8497720	8499720	Everything just turned off.
8499720	8500720	Hang on.
8500720	8502720	Let me put a little bit in this.
8503720	8505720	Who met the fire?
8506720	8508720	Who met the fire?
8519720	8522720	I really like this tiny who met the fire.
8522720	8525720	I thought it was going to be like a big donut.
8525720	8526720	But I was wrong.
8526720	8528720	It's not a big donut.
8528720	8531720	It's so cute and tiny.
8531720	8533720	It's so cute.
8533720	8536720	It's like a strawberry donut.
8537720	8539720	And I love strawberry donuts.
8539720	8541720	These are my favorite donuts.
8541720	8544720	That alongside, um,
8545720	8547720	vanilla, vanilla donut.
8548720	8550720	And a strawberry donut.
8551720	8553720	It's so cute.
8553720	8555720	It's so cute.
8571720	8573720	I am so sorry.
8573720	8576720	My computer had a big update.
8577720	8579720	I'm so sorry.
8579720	8580720	I'm so sorry.
8580720	8583720	We'll wait for everyone to come on back.
8583720	8586720	We'll wait for everyone to come back.
8586720	8587720	I'm sorry.
8587720	8588720	I died.
8590720	8592720	Mommy didn't abandon you.
8592720	8593720	I swear.
8593720	8594720	Mommy is here.
8594720	8596720	It's okay now.
8596720	8598720	Mommy is here.
8598720	8600720	Mommy is back.
8601720	8603720	Mommy is here.
8603720	8605720	Don't worry, my poor baby.
8611720	8612720	Mommy.
8620720	8623720	Mommy would never abandon you like that.
8629720	8631720	You are so brave.
8631720	8633720	So patient for me to come back.
8635720	8636720	So brave.
8636720	8638720	So brave.
8643720	8646720	Good job. You did so good.
8653720	8655720	Such good boys and such good girls.
8656720	8657720	Good job.
8667720	8669720	We're back now. We're back.
8672720	8675720	Hopefully everyone can refresh and come back again.
8675720	8677720	We're back again.
8694720	8697720	Don't need to be scared. Not anymore. Mommy's here.
8697720	8706720	Let me pull up some stuff.
8727720	8750720	It's so cute.
8757720	8773720	Everything was just closed out entirely.
8773720	8776720	Everything is gone.
8776720	8778720	Oh boy.
8778720	8784720	All right.
8784720	8787720	Did we lose our save?
8787720	8793720	I don't know if it saves along the way or saves when you exit the game.
8793720	8799720	But we didn't lose much progress.
8799720	8801720	I hope I hope.
8801720	8803720	I don't know.
8808720	8810720	Let's go back again.
8819720	8822720	I'm so good at maneuvering.
8822720	8824720	I can't see.
8831720	8833720	I'll take that.
8839720	8845720	We lost quite a bit of progress, but not a lot.
8855720	8860720	I didn't realize it, but I was bouncing my knee.
8860720	8863720	So it was doing this the entire time.
8869720	8872720	I'm like, why is my screen shaking?
8873720	8876720	Why is my screen shaking?
8887720	8890720	I was bouncing my knee.
8899720	8901720	Oh, I got to stop that habit.
8901720	8905720	It's a really big habit of mine to bounce the knee.
8905720	8909720	I don't know how to stop that kind of habit.
8909720	8911720	What's this?
8915720	8917720	Remember?
8928720	8931720	Yeah, I had to reopen all of my tabs.
8931720	8933720	Remarkable.
8933720	8936720	Companions have evolved so much.
8936720	8944720	In the earlier days, in the early days, their simple AI merely imitated human act.
8944720	8947720	Now this is all their own.
8947720	8954720	Humans often said that making art is important in desperate situations.
8954720	8957720	These are certainly desperate times.
8959720	8962720	I'll unlock some more memory.
8979720	8981720	A chair.
8985720	8987720	A chair.
8990720	8992720	A chair.
8992720	8994720	A power supply.
8995720	8997720	A chair.
9013720	9015720	I think this lit me.
9024720	9026720	Water.
9026720	9028720	Water for the kitty.
9048720	9051720	Is water even good to drink?
9054720	9056720	Haha.
9069720	9071720	I can't make a mess.
9071720	9073720	Wait, do something in the box.
9073720	9075720	Wait, give me.
9078720	9081720	It's a strange notebook with a symbol on it.
9081720	9083720	This one seems to belong to someone named...
9083720	9085720	Z-B-L-A-Z...
9085720	9087720	Sorry, what the...
9087720	9089720	Oh.
9089720	9092720	Z-B-L-A-Z-T-Z-R.
9092720	9094720	Z-B-L-A-Z-T-Z-R.
9103720	9110720	All traces of organic life has disappeared except for what we call the Xerx.
9111720	9120720	They seem to eat almost anything that moves and breed at an inconvenient, inconceivable rate,
9120720	9125720	as if being locked in the city wasn't hard enough.
9125720	9131720	I don't know what this means, but it'll probably be useful later.
9131720	9135720	Oh my gosh, my buzz with my English.
9135720	9137720	English, please.
9138720	9141720	Ball-T-Z-R.
9141720	9143720	Ball-T-Z-R.
9143720	9145720	Balls-T-Z-R.
9145720	9147720	Balls-T-Z-R.
9149720	9151720	We should go see the Momo person.
9151720	9153720	A little guardian told us about.
9157720	9159720	All these boxes.
9159720	9161720	More boxes.
9161720	9163720	Yeah.
9163720	9165720	Yeah.
9165720	9167720	Yeah.
9167720	9169720	Wee.
9185720	9187720	Is there that nothing else in here?
9189720	9191720	Oh.
9196720	9202720	If they ever come back down here and their home is going to be a mess.
9202720	9205720	Destruction, destruction.
9225720	9243720	Please don't bother Vapora. She's so clumsy.
9247720	9251720	Don't bother, you say.
9251720	9253720	I can move there?
9253720	9255720	No.
9266720	9268720	Careful, I need to focus.
9268720	9271720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9281720	9283720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9283720	9285720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9285720	9287720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9287720	9289720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9289720	9291720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9291720	9293720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9293720	9295720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9295720	9297720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9297720	9299720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9299720	9301720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9301720	9303720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9303720	9305720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9305720	9307720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9307720	9309720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9309720	9311720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9311720	9313720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9318720	9320720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9320720	9322720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9322720	9325720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9325720	9327720	I want to drop another bucket.
9327720	9329720	I don't want to drop another bucket.
9329720	9331720	You say.
9331720	9334720	Oh no, I'm not again.

9393480	9399480	It's a very old binary code you have here.
9399480	9405480	Only a real geek can read this.
9405480	9416480	Oh, I can nap here.
9417480	9422480	Ipitae
9422480	9438480	I'm swimming out.
9438480	9440480	It was like silk.
9440480	9442480	I ended up falling asleep while watching the stream.
9442480	9444480	That's fine with me.
9444480	9446480	I can't sleep.
9446480	9448480	That's perfectly fine.
9458480	9462480	It's swimming out so much.
9474480	9490480	I'm curious too to know how far it zooms out.
9490480	9492480	I'm also curious.
9505480	9510480	It's still going.
9510480	9514480	I want to make another toast.
9534480	9560480	I'm drinking a red bull.
9560480	9562480	Did it stop zooming?
9562480	9566480	It stopped zooming.
9566480	9592480	If you fall asleep, you'll doodle something on your face using a permanent marker.
9592480	9600480	I'd draw the outrageous things on your face.
9600480	9610480	If you give me the opportunity to do it, I'll do it.
9610480	9618480	It seems like a really fun town to live in.
9618480	9622480	I know how unsanitary and hard it is to live in a place like this, but I don't know.
9622480	9628480	I'd like it only because of the aesthetics.
9628480	9646480	But I know deep down I'd actually really hate living there.
9646480	9666480	Tell us to Spanish.
9666480	9670480	There's a way to live in a place like this and keep it clean and sanitary.
9670480	9672480	I'd live in it.
9672480	9680480	I'd definitely live in it.
9680480	9682480	I need a paper towel.
9682480	9686480	Paper towel or paper towel.
9710480	9738480	I wish I had jelly.
9738480	9740480	I wish I had jelly.
9740480	9742480	I want jelly.
9742480	9746480	Jelly only sounds really good.
9746480	9766480	Because I don't ever do jelly and butter, like both.
9766480	9772480	I've done that before, like jelly and butter.
9772480	9788480	Jelly and butter on the toast.
9788480	9802480	I think it tastes really good.
9802480	9806480	Okay.
9806480	9808480	Okay.
9832480	9854480	What's that?
9854480	9856480	Hello.
9856480	9858480	We gave you such a face.
9858480	9860480	You have a brown buff face.
9860480	9862480	Hep door.
9862480	9866480	Oh hey, it's you.
9866480	9868480	You do look weird and small.
9868480	9870480	But there's something about you.
9870480	9874480	Be compelled to pet you.
9874480	9878480	But I won't because I don't understand why.
9878480	9880480	The surface?
9880480	9884480	Oh, it's a sensitive subject around here.
9884480	9890480	There are some whose code can understand that concept.
9890480	9896480	There are ones who know about the outside but are too resigned to do anything.
9896480	9900480	And then there's the outside.
9900480	9902480	Let's get me.
9902480	9904480	311.
9904480	9906480	Wow, time really goes when you're enjoying a story.
9906480	9912480	We're gonna keep going.
9912480	9916480	There's outsiders.
9916480	9920480	I can imagine how they feel.
9920480	9936480	Well, there's only Momo now.
9936480	9948480	What a face.
9948480	9950480	It looks like grandpa.
9950480	9954480	Oh, can I scratch this?
9954480	9956480	Oh yeah.
9956480	9980480	Eh, eh.
9980480	10002480	Living machine.
10002480	10006480	Take care.
10006480	10010480	You've been going to listen to your relaxing voice on falsely.
10010480	10028480	Good night, have a good night.
10028480	10034480	I'll take meds in an hour.
10034480	10038480	In an hour I'll take my meds.
10038480	10040480	Yeah, excuse me.
10040480	10050480	Oh, sorry.
10050480	10072480	Scratch everything I was here.
10072480	10078480	I'm a car, obviously.
10078480	10090480	Wait, how do you look at that?
10090480	10118480	What's up with the nose?
10118480	10140480	What is that?
10140480	10162480	Oh.
10162480	10164480	There's so many channels.
10164480	10174480	Not a little bit creepy.
10174480	10176480	I got an achievement.
10176480	10180480	Browse to all the TV channels.
10180480	10196480	I got an achievement for that.
10196480	10208480	Am I supposed to be here?
10208480	10214480	Oh.
10214480	10220480	How to develop your artificial intelligence in order to be a creator.
10220480	10240480	Let's create a real human.
10240480	10242480	Oh, another music sheet.
10242480	10260480	Let's go.
10260480	10272480	Destruction.
10272480	10276480	Oh.
10276480	10286480	I don't think I have anything to unlock that.
10286480	10310480	Hey doc, I found a key to your safe.
10310480	10316480	You need to be more careful with the game item.
10316480	10320480	It's not enough to bury your safe behind a bunch of books.
10320480	10334480	Just the librarian.
10334480	10336480	Anything else in here?
10336480	10342480	What?
10342480	10352480	Oops, excuse me.
10352480	10372480	Wait, do I have the key now?
10372480	10380480	Can I unlock it with the key?
10380480	10384480	Is this it?
10384480	10388480	Oh, I do.
10388480	10392480	Nice, it's a strange notebook with a symbol on it.
10392480	10402480	This one seems to belong to someone named Doc.
10402480	10418480	The initial attempt was explosive.
10418480	10426480	I might have to test it under real conditions.
10426480	10432480	I found the design flaw in the transceiver, but I think I figured out how to fix it.
10432480	10434480	Here's the equation.
10434480	10438480	I don't know what this means, but it'll probably be useful later.
10438480	10442480	We should go see that Momo person who Guardian told us about.
10442480	10452480	Hey, destruction of books.
10452480	10462480	What's that?
10462480	10488480	Oh, it's a little space to lay down.
10488480	10490480	That's so cute.
10490480	10516480	It zooms out here too.
10516480	10528480	Good night.
10528480	10536480	I think it stops here.
10536480	10562480	What do you tell if they have in this game? It's so awesome.
10562480	10570480	Is this the librarian?
10570480	10576480	Did these books fall on top of the librarian and knock them out?
10576480	10580480	Were they reading and the books killed them?
10580480	10590480	It looks like the books fell on top of them.
10590480	10592480	Let's come help them out.
10592480	10596480	That's so sad.
10596480	10618480	That's so sad.
10618480	10646480	That's so sad.
10646480	10674480	Okay.
10674480	10692480	How do you get up there?
10692480	10714480	Is there not a way up there?
10714480	10716480	There's no way up there.
10716480	10718480	How to go down?
10718480	10720480	Down.
10720480	10722480	Okay.
10722480	10728480	Drama clothing.
10728480	10730480	I do love knitting so far.
10730480	10736480	I've knitted 478 miles of scarves.
10736480	10740480	It's something to do.
10740480	10746480	If you bring me some electrical cable, dang mosquito.
10746480	10748480	Die.
10748480	10750480	I got it.
10750480	10752480	I got the mosquito.
10752480	10768480	Let's go.
10768480	10794480	Wipe my hands.
10794480	10796480	Good night.
10796480	10816480	I hope your dreams are filled with nothing but me.
10816480	10820480	I can make you a poncho.
10820480	10824480	You inspire me, but it's not easy to find the right materials around here.
10824480	10826480	Watch me find it.
10826480	10828480	I'll find it.
10828480	10838480	It's very pretty. It looks a bit peculiar to be real though.
10838480	10852480	Is there anything else around here?
10852480	10854480	Isn't this where I came from?
10854480	10860480	Oh yeah, this is where I came from.
10860480	10862480	Someone ran up here.
10862480	10868480	What's this?
10868480	10878480	Rip humans.
10878480	10886480	No, it's not the humans.
10886480	10892480	Are you triple for me?
10892480	10896480	Humans are the first residents around here.
10896480	10900480	They are all dead now.
10900480	10902480	What do you think it feels like being dead?
10902480	10906480	I don't know.
10906480	10908480	I never really thought about it much.
10908480	10914480	I'm lying. I probably thought about it a lot.
10914480	10922480	I wonder how it feels.
10922480	10930480	I know it's silly coming from me, but are they actually at peace?
10930480	10932480	Are they?
10932480	10934480	I don't even know.
10934480	10938480	But I like to think so.
10938480	10942480	Will I be at peace when I die?
10942480	10946480	I don't know what death feels like for an AI.
10946480	10950480	I'm sorry. I didn't want to break the mode. Let's move on.
10950480	10954480	It's okay.
10954480	10962480	A robot.
10962480	10970480	Another ending machine.
10970480	10972480	Hey.
10972480	10974480	It jipped me out of a...
10974480	10976480	There.
10976480	10978480	I thought it didn't come out.
11000480	11004480	Hello.
11004480	11010480	So, if today is yesterday's tomorrow, tomorrow will be yesterday's today, right?
11010480	11012480	That was weird.
11012480	11016480	We don't age like our soft one ancestors.
11016480	11020480	They're trapped here forever.
11020480	11022480	Damn, Rosie.
11022480	11026480	That was too deep for me.
11026480	11028480	I understand.
11028480	11031480	The eternity is a long time.
11031480	11033480	It's very pretty.
11033480	11038480	It would be so nice if it was real.
11038480	11040480	But it is real.
11040480	11044480	It's real, Rosie.
11058480	11069480	Denigusil.
11069480	11076480	Awawawawawawaw.
11076480	11078480	What?
11078480	11082480	You can't get it out of your head.
11082480	11084480	What?
11084480	11087480	Nobody knows.

11381040	11383040	Oh yeah.
11383040	11387040	This is an early model of a companion.
11387040	11390040	Back then, they didn't have any personality.
11390040	11396040	They were just glorified on, I don't know must cleaners.
11396040	11401040	I think it's nice today that they eventually mimicked humans.

11477040	11478040	I didn't see that.

12055980	12058140	Um,可以 you really consume this?
12060240	12068240	Their original design didn't have a digestive system. Maybe they somehow evolved by mimicking humans.
12072240	12074240	Do you think I should try some of it?
12075240	12078240	I do not want to be disrespectful of their ways.
12080240	12081240	Don't eat it!
12083240	12086240	What if it kills you?
12086240	12090240	Oh, they don't actually eat it.

12232240	12236240	This is the two's favorite from the people living above.
12236240	12238240	Level 2.
12239240	12242240	It's a few years old, but it's something to read.
12245240	12248240	Outside? Why bother trying to find it?
12249240	12250240	We're good here.
12251240	12252240	Carl!

12437240	12438240	Shhh, shhh, shhh.
12445240	12447240	I destroy your home.
12455240	12456240	What was that?
12457240	12458240	Earth.
12459240	12462240	Earth is the third planet from the sun.
12462240	12464240	The fifth largest in the solar system.
12465240	12470240	By mass diameter, diameter, diameter.
12470240	12471240	Diameter.
12471240	12472240	Yeah.
12472240	12473240	Yeah.
12473240	12474240	Got it.
12474240	12475240	Diameter.
12475240	12476240	Yeah.
12478240	12485240	To date, it is the only celestial object known to foster life.
12486240	12496240	According to radiometric dating, the Earth is 4.54 billion years old.
12496240	12504240	It has a single natural satellite, the moon, which formed soon after.
12505240	12522240	The gravitational interaction with the moon creates the tides, stabilizes the Earth's access of rotation and gradually reduces its rotation speed.
12522240	12525240	Rotational speed is rotation speed.
12526240	12527240	Is rotational a word?
12527240	12536240	Why you sad, don't be sad?
12536240	12537240	Remember.
12539240	12540240	Back home.
12542240	12544240	Oh, back home too.
12544240	12546240	I remember this video game.
12547240	12550240	It was made just after I was created, I think.
12550240	12552240	I can't remember it well.
12553240	12556240	The scientist and I spent a lot of time playing it.
12557240	12558240	It was fun.
12558240	12559240	I miss him.
12560240	12562240	I can't remember his name.
12573240	12575240	Monster roll, boy.
12575240	12576240	Hello.
12578240	12580240	It's never going to work.
12582240	12586240	Why did I let them go?
12586240	12587240	I'm all alone now.
12589240	12590240	Hey, you.
12591240	12592240	What do you want?
12595240	12597240	This is a picture of the outside.
12597240	12598240	You want to go there?
12599240	12600240	Well, don't bother.
12601240	12602240	It's a waste of time.
12602240	12604240	It'll bring you only loneliness and despair.
12606240	12608240	My friends had this dream too.
12609240	12612240	But now they're gone and I'm all alone.
12616240	12621240	It's like a Hawaiian shirt.
12627240	12629240	I don't know where they ended up.
12630240	12635240	I tried to contact them, but that transceiver didn't work.
12636240	12641240	My friends and I took notes about research about the outside.
12641240	12643240	Here, take mine if you really want to go there.
12646240	12647240	No, you're all alone.
12647240	12648240	I'm done with this outside.
12649240	12650240	Good luck.
12652240	12653240	I don't seem very sad.
12654240	12655240	This is friends.
12656240	12658240	Let me check the notebook, people.
12659240	12661240	The outside.
12662240	12663240	The outside.
12667240	12668240	The outside.
12668240	12669240	I hear some madness.
12672240	12673240	The outside.
12676240	12677240	I can't read.
12678240	12679240	I can't read.
12683240	12684240	Help.
12686240	12687240	I can't read.
12691240	12692240	The outside.
12693240	12694240	The outside.
12695240	12696240	Manifest.
12698240	12700240	Manifest ho.
12701240	12702240	Manifest ho.
12703240	12704240	Manifest.
12704240	12705240	Manifest.

12709240	12710240	Manifest ho.
12716240	12717240	Manifest ho.
12718240	12719240	Manifest ho.
12720240	12721240	Manifest ho.
12722240	12723240	Manifest ho.
12723240	12724240	We must go outside.
12725240	12729240	And then we must protect our brothers and sisters.
12730240	12732240	We must stay away from Zergs.
12732240	12733240	Yeah.
12740240	12742240	It is sign of Clementine.
12744240	12745240	Bald.
12745240	12746240	Bald Pizarre.
12747240	12749240	Doc and Momo.
12750240	12752240	It looks like Momo's name was added later.
12758240	12761240	We should show them the other notebooks that we found.
12763240	12764240	Hey Momo.
12765240	12766240	Hey little cat.
12766240	12769240	Are you still looking for those useless notebooks?
12770240	12771240	I have them.
12771240	12773240	Have Clementine's.
12773240	12775240	Oh you found Clementine's notes?
12775240	12777240	She was really brave you know.
12778240	12780240	The most fearless person I ever met.
12781240	12782240	Oh.
12784240	12785240	Bald Pizarre.
12786240	12788240	As Bald Pizarre is notebook right?
12789240	12790240	I never quite understood.
12790240	12792240	What he was talking about most of the time.
12793240	12794240	But he was very wise.
12795240	12796240	Oh.
12797240	12798240	Docs.
12799240	12800240	Wait.
12800240	12802240	They actually found all my friends' notebooks.
12804240	12805240	Is that?
12805240	12806240	Oh.
12806240	12807240	What's that note?
12808240	12810240	The transceiver can be repaired?
12811240	12812240	This is incredible.
12814240	12817240	That means we should be able to communicate outside of Sloan.
12817240	12818240	Clementine.
12819240	12820240	Bald's a hard dog.
12820240	12822240	I'm sorry it's out of her cause.
12822240	12823240	I'll promise you.
12824240	12827240	I will find a way to reach the surface.
12829240	12830240	Thank you.
12831240	12833240	We might be able to find you a way up.
12833240	12834240	Yay.
12835240	12838240	Now let's fix this piece of junk transceiver.
12840240	12843240	It's fixed around the wall.
12843240	12845240	Around the wall.
12846240	12848240	Around the wall.
12854240	12855240	Et voilà.
12856240	12857240	It works.
12862240	12863240	Et voilà.
12864240	12865240	What do you mean?
12873240	12875240	What if I'm not ready to go?
12880240	12881240	What's this?
12882240	12883240	The city has...
12884240	12885240	what?
12886240	12887240	Syllinitricle.
12888240	12889240	Syllinitricle.
12890240	12891240	Syllinitricle.
12892240	12893240	Syllinitricle.
12894240	12895240	Syllinitricle.
12896240	12897240	Syllinitricle.
12898240	12899240	Syllinitricle?
12900240	12901240	Syllinitricle?
12901240	12902240	Syllinitricle?
12902240	12903240	Syllinitricle?
12904240	12905240	Syllinitricle?
12906240	12907240	Syllinitricle.
12909240	12910240	Syllinitricle.
12911240	12913240	Syllinitricle.
12915240	12916240	Syllinitricle.
12916240	12917240	Syllinitricle.
12918240	12919240	Syllinitricle?
12920240	12921240	Syllinitricle.
12922240	12923240	Syllinitricle.
12924240	12925240	Syllinitricle.
12927240	12928240	Syllinitricle.
12928400	12934000	We install the trans seever, at the top of that tower, which really communicates with the city.
12934160	12938400	My friend might still be outside from the dark.
12938560	12945880	We install the samasОd, as we saw in a short video of the Simade v Аte Muужjage.
12946040	12952480	Media comments and面 gun.
12952640	12956480	I watched the video as well but the recording looks interesting.
12956480	12958480	My friends might still be out there.
12960480	12962480	Up there is a way out.
12962480	12963480	They'll know it.
12965480	12968480	Really only one small and quick enough to evade the zirks.
12969480	12971480	We need you, little outsider.
12971480	12973480	Bring us to the sky.
12978480	12979480	This way.
12987480	12988480	Where am I?
12989480	12990480	Hey.
12996480	12997480	Hmm.
13001480	13002480	Hmm.
13005480	13006480	Hmm.
13009480	13010480	Is this safe?
13010480	13011480	Hmm, safe.
13028480	13030480	Very convenient buckets.
13035480	13036480	Rooftops.
13040480	13041480	Hmm.
13045480	13047480	I don't like this.
13047480	13048480	Scary.
13071480	13072480	Hmm.
13073480	13074480	Hmm.
13095480	13096480	Eh.
13101480	13102480	Hmm.
13125480	13126480	Hmm.
13131480	13132480	Hmm.
13135480	13137480	Aha, I can get me.
13144480	13146480	Oh, where we go?
13146480	13147480	From here?
13147480	13148480	Up there?
13150480	13151480	No, this way.
13158480	13159480	Remember?
13161480	13162480	Hmm.
13169480	13171480	The city is full of neon.
13172480	13173480	There's a noise this way.
13175480	13177480	There used to be strict energy caps.
13178480	13180480	Especially in the salt slums.
13182480	13184480	But people couldn't handle the constant darkness.
13186480	13189480	One day someone lit up ramble lamps.
13190480	13193480	Nian signs all over their house.
13194480	13197480	That person was taken away and never seen again.
13198480	13200480	But people saw hope.
13200480	13205480	And not long after, everyone started putting lots of lights in their homes.
13207480	13210480	There was nothing to the oppressors could do.
13211480	13214480	It was a way for the people to see color again.
13214480	13217480	Like on the outside, I think it helped.
13220480	13221480	Hmm.
13245480	13246480	Hmm.
13250480	13251480	Hmm.
13253480	13255480	Do we go that way?
13280480	13281480	Hmm.
13281480	13282480	Hmm.
13282480	13283480	Hmm.

13617440	13624000	Niko ni niko korp they're responsible for waste management
13624000	13634720	As trash from the upper levels overloaded the slums to try to develop bacteria to dissolve at all
13636560	13643360	After the humans disappeared that bacteria mutated growing eating way more than trash
13644800	13649120	And now we have zirks. Oh, no, let's go
13649440	13651440	Oh
13652960	13654960	It's all sticky

13726560	13728560	Wait don't I need this open?
13734400	13736400	Like this
13739120	13741120	Oh
13758560	13760560	Oh
13762080	13764080	Oh, thank you
13769120	13771120	Oh
13800000	13802000	Da
13824640	13826640	This is treachery
13827600	13829600	This is treachery
13847280	13849280	I have no clue what's happening
13850240	13853280	I don't know I thought it was a force restart
13853840	13857760	But I don't a force update, but I checked to see
13859120	13864000	I went to go check to see if my computer even has like even is on
13864400	13871440	To update for anything during this time and it's not it's not it's not set to update during this time
13871760	13874080	So it wasn't a force restart. I have no clue
13874400	13877120	My computer keeps turning off on me
13878720	13883120	It keeps turning off or restarting on its own and I have no clue why
13887280	13894800	I have no clue why I'm such bad luck. It's so bad. I don't know what's happening
13904080	13906080	Oh
13921280	13923760	It's not my internet my internet is fine like
13925760	13929520	Fairly getting fixed my internet is perfectly fine at the moment
13930560	13932560	So it's not my internet
13932880	13939440	Because if it was my internet then that would have turned off then that would have turned off and so would have this would have turned off
13939520	13942000	And so would have my fan and so my
13942480	13946480	Little broken half broken mini fridge would have also turned off
13947040	13949040	But no
13949280	13952160	So it's not my power. It's not my internet
13952800	13957120	Because the little bar thingy didn't pop up if it was the internet it wouldn't turn off my
13958320	13960320	Computer if it was the internet
13961280	13967600	Instead it would just disconnect me and then reconnect me disconnect me reconnect me, but if it was power
13968640	13972240	If it was power half of this side of my room would turn off
13973920	13975920	If it was power
13976960	13981360	But everything else is still on and running just fine. So I don't know what it is
13983920	13985920	We'll figure it out
13986880	13988880	later
13989760	13991760	We'll figure it out
13993760	13995760	Uh
13997280	13999280	For now I can like uh
14004400	14009040	I don't know turn this down. It's not any of this like I checked
14010960	14015280	My cpu everything is running everything is running smoothly
14015840	14021280	Very smoothly. Look at that everything rings running completely smoothly
14025760	14027760	Yeah, this is fine
14028560	14030400	This is fine
14030400	14033040	So is this so is this this is okay
14034320	14036320	Everything's fine
14038000	14040000	Yeah later
14045920	14056240	I'm gonna keep this on in the background so I can look at it just to see how it is. I'm playing
14064960	14066800	Like the purring and he's gonna come back in
14068880	14070880	At least it stopped right where we left off
14071520	14073520	And
14088320	14092800	This is a PC on its last legs impossible. It's a completely brand new rig
14093280	14099760	There's no way that it could be on its last legs my old computer. Yeah, that was on its last legs
14099840	14101840	But this is completely new
14101920	14103920	There's no way
14104240	14107200	I just have horrible luck when it comes to technology
14108480	14110480	That I know
14110640	14112640	That I know my head is big hang on
14115520	14117520	That I know
14117920	14119920	Oh
14133280	14136080	Oh, we have to do all of this again. Oh man
14148080	14157520	We need stronti and tekken. Right now main sound will help me with whatever needs to be done
14160240	14162240	It will help
14163040	14170240	They were responsible for waste management. Oh, yeah, we already read all of this
14172000	14177360	Main sound has been helping me with everything else. So
14177520	14180880	Bar we still can't figure it out meds. Oh, yeah, I haven't taken that
14181440	14184080	Let me take that right now. There's heart medication

15062740	15066740	He would like zoom across the floor with it.
15074740	15078740	I can't. Where is it? Speech bubble.
15078740	15082740	Look, a note.
15082740	15087740	A little outside of your reading this. That means you're still alive. Excellent.
15087740	15092740	I took some equipment to the bar to take advantage of the antenna.
15092740	15095740	Come meet me there.
15095740	15100740	I've locked the window but the code to open it is quite simple.
15100740	15103740	It is.
15103740	15106740	That's supposed to be simple? The fuck?
15106740	15110740	It's not fucking simple.
15110740	15115740	Be careful. It is case sensitive. See, you have the bar.
15115740	15119740	Whoa, whoa.
15119740	15124740	That must be the code for the window near the entrance. Let's go.
15124740	15129740	Chad, remember that? Remember that? Remember the code for me?
15134740	15139740	Chad, remember that? Remember that? Remember that please?
15139740	15143740	Remember that?
15145740	15149740	The code was...
15149740	15153740	What was the code? What was the code?
15153740	15157740	What was the code?
15157740	15161740	It's my back.
15161740	15165740	Let's try it again.
15165740	15169740	Let's see. Success.
15169740	15173740	You guys did it! Yay!
15173740	15178740	I was at the bar waiting for house.
15197740	15201740	Oh yeah, the thing that came back.
15202740	15207740	I'm going to get the key.
15207740	15211740	Come on.
15211740	15215740	Come on.
15215740	15217740	Come on.
15217740	15221740	Come on, come on.
15221740	15224740	Come on.

15763560	15767560	I will get you to move one way or another.
15771560	15773560	You want something?
15774560	15776560	No, aren't you sitting earlier?

15807560	15810560	Let me see if I can get this thing working.
15818560	15820560	I almost got it.
15823560	15827560	Hello? Can anyone hear me?
15828560	15830560	Hello? Yes, we can hear you.
15830560	15833560	We're from the slums. We're looking for a way out and...
15833560	15835560	What is that? You?
15836560	15837560	Balzahar?
15838560	15839560	Mama?
15842560	15846560	I can't believe it. I'm so happy to hear your voice, Balzahar.
15847560	15848560	Where are you?
15848560	15850560	Are the others okay?
15851560	15854560	Yes, we are safe. We found a way out.
15857560	15858560	Hello?
15858560	15860560	Can you still hear me?
15860560	15863560	You have to go through the sewers to reach us.
15864560	15867560	Very dangerous. It lurks everywhere.
15870560	15872560	Sewers? How? Hello?
15873560	15875560	Darn it. We've lost the signal.
15876560	15879560	I can't believe it. Balzahar is alive.
15880560	15884560	He on the other outside has managed to go up through the sewers.
15885560	15888560	The sewers are the most dangerous place in the slums.
15888560	15891560	But if Balzahar made it, there must be a way.
15903560	15904560	Seamus.
15905560	15908560	Of course, it has to be someone named Seamus.
15911560	15912560	I...
15914560	15917560	You'll never get past the sewers.
15917560	15919560	It's infested with serics.
15919560	15921560	They'll make a quick meal out of you.
15921560	15923560	Especially you, little one.
15924560	15926560	Many try their luck in the past.
15926560	15928560	It doesn't end well.
15929560	15932560	Anyway, I warned you.
15933560	15935560	Your business is none of my business.
15941560	15943560	Seamus.
15944560	15948560	His father, Doc, used to be a great scientist.
15949560	15952560	He was working on some new weapon to fight the zirks.
15953560	15958560	So, years ago, he went off to test the device and never came back.
15959560	15962560	Seamus has never been the same since.
15962560	15965560	Don't listen to Seamus. He's just scared like I was.
15965560	15970560	If Doc build a weapon, that's our ticket to join the outsiders.
15971560	15975560	And as notebook Doc mentioned, the secret lab a few times.
15975560	15977560	That must be where he was working on it.
15979560	15981560	There might be a clue.
15982560	15984560	But I don't know.
15985560	15987560	I don't know.
15987560	15989560	I don't know where he was working on it.
15990560	15994560	There might be a clue in Seamus' apartment.
15994560	15996560	Go on, follow me.
16005560	16008560	I follow Mr. Robot.
16017560	16020560	I don't know where he was working on it.
16020560	16023560	I don't know where he was working on it.
16044560	16046560	Can you move it away?
16046560	16048560	Grandma made a scarf. Isn't it wonderful?
16049560	16051560	She knits so well.
16077560	16080560	I don't know where he was working on it.
16080560	16082560	I don't know where he was working on it.

16369580	16371580	Oh, right. I forgot.
16371580	16373580	Yeah.
16373580	16375580	These blueprints...
16375580	16380580	They must be for his zerk weapon.
16380580	16385580	Papa was always so secretive with his work.
16385580	16388580	He told me the weapon was working.
16388580	16392580	In theory, but it needed a real life test.
16392580	16396580	He went outside the slums, and he never came back.
16409580	16414580	Robots, new headlines, zerk, are officially no longer under control.
16415580	16417580	They now eat metal.
16434580	16437580	The flux are blueprints.
16437580	16443580	Concept, light-based, handgun, low-priority, visual-appearance-size,
16443580	16449580	sceptile, emitted, high-priority, test in real condition,
16449580	16454580	objective, 20 zerk destroyed per second.
16468580	16470580	Let me down.
16470580	16472580	Is there anything in here?
16472580	16474580	Nothing, I don't know.
16478580	16483580	I'm stuck. Get it off me! Get it off me!
16483580	16485580	Okay, there you go.
16488580	16492580	Anything up here? No?
16497580	16506580	Observation.
16506580	16512580	They now eat metal, then why haven't they eaten everything?
16512580	16516580	Maybe because they take time? I don't know.
16516580	16519580	Maybe it takes time. Maybe this is...
16519580	16522580	They just developed into doing this.
16523580	16529580	Maybe they become intelligent.
16529580	16535580	Maybe there is smarter bacteria now.
16535580	16538580	I need dwelling.
16538580	16542580	They are just not that hungry.
16542580	16545580	Cute sounds, but never friendly.
16545580	16547580	Old bacteria of human time.
16547580	16550580	Eat all kinds of materials.
16550580	16553580	Total vision in the dark.
16553580	16555580	React to intense light.
16555580	16557580	I'll see, there you go.
16557580	16561580	Maybe because light stops them.
16561580	16563580	Maybe it's light.
16563580	16566580	Light stops them.
16566580	16569580	Am I missing something?
16569580	16571580	Oh, a box.
16581580	16584580	Find anything interesting in here?
16584580	16587580	Yeah, this broken tracker.
16590580	16592580	Wait, I remember that.
16592580	16594580	That's his tracker.
16594580	16598580	Papa always used that tracker to keep an eye on where I was.
16598580	16602580	Maybe he can reverse it to find where he went.
16602580	16605580	I can't believe my papa might still be alive.
16605580	16607580	I missed him so much.
16608580	16611580	You need a weapon for this herbs, right?
16611580	16613580	My papa definitely took one with him.
16616580	16619580	We just need to repair the tracker so we can find him.
16619580	16622580	Someone in the slum should be able to help.
16622580	16625580	Come with me. I'll open the door for you.
16625580	16627580	Whoa.
16627580	16629580	Where are we going?
16629580	16631580	Where are we going?
16637580	16639580	Meow.
16639580	16641580	Meow.
16644580	16646580	Meow.
16652580	16654580	You gotta fix that tracker.
16654580	16656580	You're resourceful.
16656580	16658580	Maybe you can find someone in the slum to help.
16658580	16661580	Alright, see you later, shameless.
16667580	16669580	I'll see you later.
16682580	16685580	You aren't always standing here. Who are you?
16685580	16688580	Look at all this great stuff that falls at our tracks.
16688580	16690580	So many treasures.
16690580	16694580	You should go visit Bart, Barterman.
16694580	16697580	There's something for everyone over there.
16698580	16700580	Bart, Barterman.
16700580	16702580	Barterman, yeah.
16702580	16704580	Barterman.
16707580	16709580	He's not Barterman.
16709580	16711580	He's Azuz.
16711580	16713580	Azuz.
16713580	16715580	Azuz.
16715580	16717580	Lito.

16719580	16721580	Vinz?
16721580	16723580	Where's Barterman?
16724580	16726580	Bart, Barterman.

17304540	17307540	Uh...
17310540	17314540	Does any of these give me a hint?
17314540	17319540	This tracker is meant to find some sort of robot.
17319540	17323540	Of course it's broken, we should find a way to repair it.
17323540	17329540	Oh! I know! I know! I know! I know! Go fix it! I know!
17329540	17331540	This person.

17354540	17358540	Oh wow, that's a great tracker. I recognize this model.
17358540	17365540	It's Touhima BR2000.
17365540	17371540	You can track anyone with this little gadget, may I?
17371540	17378540	Let me take a look. Just gotta give it an update and one more thing. Voila!
17382540	17387540	There you go, little one. Go look, find out who you're looking for.
17387540	17391540	Thanks, Elliot!
17391540	17394540	Elliot's so nice.
17407540	17410540	Really nice. That's a great trait these days.

17492540	17495540	You didn't. You fixed it a little done.
17495540	17497540	Give me here.

17520540	17524540	Is Papa really alive? I can't believe it.
17524540	17528540	Let's follow the tracker. Maybe we'll find where my papa went.

18617740	18621820	i've always used the stove i've never warmed up milk in the microwave
18623100	18630460	i like barely i barely like warming up food in the microwave unless it's it says you have to
18630460	18636220	i do everything on the stove that stove has been with me through thickened thin
18638460	18644780	i have used that stove for everything
18644780	18653420	i have used that stove for everything microwave milk i have the sneeze
18660780	18663260	nope it went away instead my eyes are watery now
18663580	18676940	yes my milk is the best milk
18683820	18690860	i want some coffee too sometimes i do but why is it warm your milk up on the stove
18693260	18700940	i have never warmed up milk ever you should try it apparently warming up milk is really good for
18700940	18708940	bed for sleeping i used to drink hot chocolate before bed but i haven't been able to do that lately
18709820	18717500	it was that or tea i would have make tea honey lemon tea i had the honey myself and i haven't had
18717500	18724940	honey in a long time because my mom likes to to put the honey in the federator and it's so hard
18724940	18731820	and doesn't come out of the bottle who federates honey i don't understand i had an argument with her about it
18733500	18741180	like why do you put fucking honey in the fridge it's so stupid it becomes like super hard
18741660	18747260	just put it take it out it should for honey shouldn't be federated
18749180	18749980	fight me on that
18754140	18754860	can't use it
18760060	18765900	they put honey in a fridge and they say some ketchup shouldn't be federated but i like ketchup
18765900	18773580	federated it turns all like vinegary and smells bad unless you shake it if you take it out of the
18773580	18778860	fridge they say ketchup shouldn't be federated but there are some ketchup bottles that they
18778860	18784460	federate after opening but there are some ketchup bottles that they don't federate but people just
18784460	18793180	don't read bottles anymore to make sure so they leave the ketchup um out of the fridge
18793260	18798620	i think it's it tastes horrible and sour
18802140	18807820	cold honey is cool yeah but you can't it won't it doesn't move but it becomes hard
18815740	18820300	honey literally cannot go bad so there's no need to federate honey there isn't
18821260	18822620	it doesn't need to be federated
18825740	18834380	use a high spec for the honey i have some honey lemon tea a few days ago my throat because i
18835100	18838220	was a discord carry okay hurt my throat
18841020	18844140	a honey lemon tea is great how much honey do you do
18850940	18864620	i have a hundred
18866140	18870780	a hundred teabags probably a little less than that now because i've drunk a couple a
18870780	18877900	couple of tea maybe like 80 something 80 teabags now
18887100	18889100	a hundred yeah a hundred
18893100	18896380	i don't like leaving my house like yeah i buy everything i need it
18896460	18903580	but what is the expiration date does it have one does tea actually expire i don't think tea
18903580	18911100	expires tea can't expire can it tea can't expire can it you really
18914780	18917100	this fire there's no expiration date on this
18920620	18922140	yeah it's not expiration date
18927340	18933100	oh there is an expiration date oh
18941660	18949100	i have till next year i'm fine it's fine i have till next year
18949420	18961820	i have till February of next year we're fine
18961980	18964540	okay
18973420	18976540	how long does it take hot chocolate to expire
18978460	18983020	i bought 150 of those i don't have the box i'm not gonna go look right now
18992380	18998220	next year can pass really quickly with the treasury of tea such as yours i recommend drinking
18998220	19002780	about two bags a day i get sick pretty cool frequently so it should be fine
19005100	19016540	i get sick very frequently so it'll be used
19021900	19024540	so
19034700	19038540	i still play with my partner about sauce in the fridge it's mind boggling
19041980	19046540	i think only some things should go in the fridge honestly
19052540	19058940	only some things honey should be refrigerated it should it should not be
19058940	19063580	refrigerated it doesn't say on the bottle that needs to be refrigerated literally google it
19063580	19071260	and it will tell you that not all honey needs to be refrigerated i only put some sauces it says
19071260	19077180	it on the bottles if it says on the bottle refrigerate after opening it i'm putting it in
19077180	19084220	the refrigerator all right it says recommended put in refrigerator after opening and it's gonna go
19084220	19090220	in the fridge all right if it says it i'm doing it
19095900	19099660	well this is nonsense when you suck it on the bottle read it
19107500	19113660	okay
19117660	19124140	am i worried you guys gonna have gross expired spoiled food and still eat it because the
19124140	19130460	expiration date says it doesn't expire well it doesn't expire until unless you treat it the
19130460	19136220	way it says to be treated you you that's like leaving milk out and then saying oh well the
19136220	19141020	expiration date says it doesn't expire until like next month but you just keep drinking it because
19141020	19150380	you left it out for like a day and yeah well i don't need to refrigerate it because it doesn't
19150380	19154780	say it needs to be refrigerated but everyone knows knows needs to be refrigerated so you
19154780	19167900	refrigerate the milk just because it's got just because some milk can survive without being
19167900	19172860	refrigerated doesn't mean not all milk because survive not being refrigerated the same goes for
19172860	19179500	most other foods if it says it on a bottle you do what it says because they know better than you do
19185020	19189660	that's like this one person i used to yell at me about refrigerating eggs
19194780	19199100	they're like oh but if it came from a chicken then it doesn't need to be refrigerated
19203020	19207500	the whole point of refrigerating most eggs was to stop fertilization
19214780	19229100	keep them eggs cold

19259860	19267860	I think they had this whole mental of eat things as soon as you get it, but they didn't really understand the concept of storing food.
19269860	19277860	You put it in the fridge to keep it cold for a reason. You're keeping it cold for a reason.
19290860	19295860	You put it in the fridge to keep it cold for a reason.
19296860	19301860	Imagine leaving an egg out on the counter only to come home to a baby chick.
19307860	19313860	That has actually happened to some people where they had a, like a chickie.
19314860	19319860	It was like half formed in an egg because they left the egg out.
19320860	19327860	It was like halfly formed and then when they broke it open, like a chickie came out.
19333860	19337860	But it wasn't an alive chick though, unfortunately.
19344860	19349860	I think they stopped eating eggs after that.
19352860	19356860	Did they eat it? No, they were scared. They were shocked. They screamed.
19367860	19372860	I think they stopped eating eggs after that. I think it was very traumatizing for them.
19373860	19378860	I don't remember. I don't talk to them anymore.
19379860	19385860	I just heard that this year apparently fresh non-processed eggs can be kept out on a counter and be fine.
19386860	19393860	Yes, non-processed, non-processed, non-processed food can be left out.
19394860	19399860	The majority of it can, but not processed food. It does not work that way.
19399860	19402860	It does not work that way.
19414860	19420860	Some people just don't really do that much research to find out that it's not that way.
19421860	19428860	So they learn about this stuff online somewhere and then they never actually do self research to see if that information holds true.
19429860	19432860	For everything.
19433860	19436860	They just believe everything they hear and see.
19440860	19442860	You're guilty almost.
19444860	19449860	Do your research. Don't trust everything. So bully dilly.
19450860	19454860	Do your research. Oh my gosh, silly babies.
19455860	19460860	Do your research now.
19462860	19465860	Common sense is kind of eroded nowadays.
