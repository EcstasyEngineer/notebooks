19:08.360 --> 19:10.680
When your job is a poo,

19:10.680 --> 19:12.680
so when your poo hits your prostate on the way out,

19:12.680 --> 19:14.080
it feels like a poo.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.080
Jarby was a poo.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.080
Jarby is a poo.

19:28.680 --> 19:31.280
Oh wait, is she giving a blowjob?

19:31.320 --> 19:33.320
That's what it looks like.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.480
That's what it looks like to me.

19:35.480 --> 19:36.480
Oh, oh.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.480

20:08.120 --> 20:10.120

20:10.120 --> 20:12.120
Okay, it's a winky face.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.120
I was like, what is meow?

20:14.120 --> 20:15.120

20:17.120 --> 20:19.120

20:43.040 --> 20:45.040

20:46.040 --> 20:48.040
Oh my God.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.040
Oh, this is a good time for it.

20:51.040 --> 20:53.040
I see you understood me.

20:55.040 --> 20:57.040
Oh my God.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.960
Oh, I love the details.

Are you in the lobby?

21:19.960 --> 21:21.960
Do you need to reload the lobby?

21:21.960 --> 21:23.960
It's going to do it on its own usually.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.960
No, I'm gone.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.880
The link should be in the discord.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.880
Don't show your fucking screen on the discord.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.880
Yeah.

21:33.880 --> 21:34.880
Don't do that.

21:34.880 --> 21:35.880
Don't do that.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.880
I don't see all of our naughty photos we just send to each other.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.880
I want to do that.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.880
It's mostly memes.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.880
Any memes.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.880
I mean, to be fair, we did share.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.880
We did share some actually.

21:48.880 --> 21:52.880
We did share some lucky nudes of ours.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.880
They've seen my titties.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.800
I saw Brooklyn as the girls with my nudes.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.800
So I was like, this is what Amy would do.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.800
This is what A.C. would do.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.800
Your discord is so chaotic.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.800
Okay, real though.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.800
But also, I did snort out my tea.

22:11.800 --> 22:14.800
It went down the wrong hole and went up my nose.

22:14.800 --> 22:18.800
Wow, Marcy, I hear you snort in tea.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.800
This is what got me off at the stock throne.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.800
Is this better?

22:23.800 --> 22:25.800
It hurts so much.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.800
Can you hear me now?

22:27.800 --> 22:29.800
Oh, yeah.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.800
Oh my god.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.800
That's why you guys win riffs on to me.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.800
I'm so sorry.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.800
My clit is getting a little heart beat right now every time you talk.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.800
Oh no.

22:41.800 --> 22:45.800
I was muted and my thingy was turned down.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.800
That's my bad.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.800
Oopsie.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.800
Oopsie.

22:51.800 --> 22:55.800
I feel like Azura could do a really good Jennifer Coolidge impression.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.800
Jennifer Coolidge.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.800
I don't know what Jennifer Coolidge is impression.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.800
She was like, wait, you don't know Jennifer Coolidge?

23:01.800 --> 23:03.800
Jennifer Coolidge.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.800
I am such a big tittie.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.800
Oh my god.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.800
I can't do it.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.800
I can't do it.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.800
I can't do it.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.800
I can't do it.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.800
I can't do it.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.800
I can't do it.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.800
I can't do it.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.800
Oh my god.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.800
Jennifer Coolidge.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.800
Speaking of your gap for the Rizzler.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.800
That's so good.

23:29.800 --> 23:33.800
Why are we opening our gap for the Rizzler?

23:33.800 --> 23:35.800
I just dropped the bass.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.800
Blown, blown.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.800
The discreet is not working.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.800
Click that link in the general description.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.800
It's not with discreet's preference.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.800
Is it only in that end?

23:45.800 --> 23:47.800
No.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.800
Are you okay?

23:49.800 --> 23:51.800
Are you okay?

23:51.800 --> 23:53.800
What is happening?

23:53.800 --> 23:55.800
All I hear is screaming.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.800
Your mic cuts out.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.800
So it just goes eww.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.800
Eww.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.800
Eww.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.800
I don't even know what's happening.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.800
It's constantly loading.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.800
It says, did you know

24:09.800 --> 24:11.800
Group DLs

24:11.800 --> 24:13.800
can have up to 10 members?

24:13.800 --> 24:15.800
I'm sorry.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.800
Now I see the discord.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.800
If I open it up, you guys can't see it.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.800
My discord is just broken.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.800
I don't see anything else.

24:23.800 --> 24:25.800
I would close the window capture

24:25.800 --> 24:27.800
in the OBS just in case.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.800
Yes, you can turn it off.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.800
Are we starting a new lobby?

24:31.800 --> 24:33.800
A new lobby?

24:33.800 --> 24:35.800
Hang on.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.800
Let me invite to this lobby.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.800
That's power.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.800
Are we going to a different room?

24:41.800 --> 24:43.800
I don't know.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.800
What is that?

24:45.800 --> 24:47.800
I only see one of you.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.800
On mine, sorry.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.800
A new one?

24:51.800 --> 24:53.800
There's another one.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.800
Are you okay?

24:55.800 --> 24:57.800
Okay, which one should we play?

24:57.800 --> 24:59.800
Which one?

24:59.800 --> 25:01.800
Normal, which we just did.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.800
Knock off, keep yourself focused.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.800
Try to replicate the drawings while the clock gets faster.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.800
Animation.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.800
Create animations in a collaborative way.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.800
Icebreaker, play with a sentence.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.800
Drawings, exquisite corpse.

25:13.800 --> 25:15.800
Create surrealist characters connected by the top of the drawings.

25:15.800 --> 25:17.800
Don't know what that means.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.800
Hold on.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.800
Burp friends, have a good time with that.

25:21.800 --> 25:23.800
Compliment, complete the sketch.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.800
Start with basic lines and see other players' interpretations.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.800
Masterpiece,

25:27.800 --> 25:29.800
create a piece of art, play in a single turn with no time limit.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.800
I feel like story would be funny.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.800
Write a narrative using only the previous sentence as a reference.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.800
Yes, okay, okay.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.800
Story, story, story.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.800
Do you want to do a story?

25:39.800 --> 25:41.800
Let's try story.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.800
What are we doing?

25:43.800 --> 25:45.800
What is this?

25:45.800 --> 25:47.800
Start writing a story.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.800
Wait, do I have to write a full story or just a sentence?

25:53.800 --> 25:55.800
Just a sentence.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.800
Just one sentence.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.800
Okay, okay.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.800
Do you like write the whole story or no?

26:03.800 --> 26:05.800
No, you have really limited characters.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.800
I don't know it.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.800
No!

26:13.800 --> 26:15.800
What did you do?

26:15.800 --> 26:17.800
There's time, there's time.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.800
15 seconds, love.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.800
Oh my god, I wanted to write more.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.800
I wanted to write more.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.800
You can only write one sentence.

26:27.800 --> 26:29.800
Fuck.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.800
Shit.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.800
The end.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.800
We are not being attack allegations.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.800
We are not.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.800
What the fuck is happening?

26:49.800 --> 26:51.800
Oh, they're going to know this is me spelling it

26:51.800 --> 26:53.800
because I didn't use a Z on that.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.800
I'm just going to leave it like that.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.800
Yep, I'm sending it.

27:01.800 --> 27:03.800
I'm not even spell checking.

27:03.800 --> 27:05.800
Fuck it.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.800
Fuck it.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.800
Fuck it.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.800
I'm bad at stories.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.800
What?

27:21.800 --> 27:23.800
So big.

27:29.800 --> 27:31.800
Oh, the sentence is so small.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.800
I want to give up everything.

27:33.800 --> 27:35.800
Me too.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.800
Let's do short.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.800
I think I get shorter over time.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.800
I want to be like, bi-bing.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.800
I'm going to write until, fuck.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.800
What?

27:55.800 --> 27:57.800
Um, okay.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.800
Let's see.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.800
Let's see.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.800
Oh, no.

28:07.800 --> 28:09.800
Fuck.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.800
Fuck, I'm so bad.

28:13.800 --> 28:15.800
Fuck.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.800
It's funny because

28:17.800 --> 28:19.800
I hate this. I can't think of anything.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.800
The wavelengths, the snowberries, the snippets,

28:21.800 --> 28:23.800
the pin pals,

28:23.800 --> 28:25.800
the bleeding hearts and the harem

28:25.800 --> 28:27.800
all get to see this unfold

28:27.800 --> 28:29.800
and we're all just taping like

28:29.800 --> 28:31.800
Oh, fuck it.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.800
I don't fucking know.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.800
Oh, you.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.800
Wait, is that the fucking

28:39.800 --> 28:41.800
and

28:41.800 --> 28:43.800
happy kitty

28:43.800 --> 28:45.800
sleepy kitty

28:45.800 --> 28:47.800
purr purr purr.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.800
You watch fucking

28:49.800 --> 28:51.800
big bang theory.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.800
Wait, that's my spell.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.800
Paris.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.800
Fuck.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.800
Give me more.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.800
I need more letters.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.800
I need more like

29:09.800 --> 29:11.800
amazing

29:11.800 --> 29:13.800
amazing

29:13.800 --> 29:15.800
writer.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.800
They jerk so hard.

29:17.800 --> 29:19.800
Motherfuckers want to find me.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.800
That sounds like sheavey.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.800
No.

29:25.800 --> 29:27.800
They jerk so hard.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.800
Motherfuckers want to find me.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.800
I don't know this lyric though.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.800
This agency

29:33.800 --> 29:35.800
is crazy.

29:35.800 --> 29:37.800
We can't just

29:37.800 --> 29:39.800
I spelled it wrong but that's the point.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.800
I hate that's like

29:41.800 --> 29:43.800
they don't give you enough to write.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.800
It's like

29:45.800 --> 29:47.800
this is not enough.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.800
Fuck off.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.800
Oh boy. Okay, let's see what's happening.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.800
What the fuck is going to be?

29:55.800 --> 29:57.800
Let's do the auto.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.800
This is terrible.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.800
How about everybody reads their own story?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.800
Yeah, of course.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.800
Okay, I go first.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.800
In a galaxy far far away

30:07.800 --> 30:09.800
there was a goat with big titties.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.800
She had so much milkers

30:11.800 --> 30:13.800
and started raining milk.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.800
Azera then went home

30:15.800 --> 30:17.800
to make an empire made milk daily.

30:17.800 --> 30:19.800
It was so successful

30:19.800 --> 30:21.800
the neighboring kingdoms became jealous.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.800
They also wanted some of the juicy.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.800
Ew cooties are not good.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.800
Good.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.800
You're not good.

30:33.800 --> 30:35.800
You're not good.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.800
Oh boy.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.800
Why do we both start to sing?

30:41.800 --> 30:43.800
There was a boy by a princess

30:43.800 --> 30:45.800
who was trying to fit in too.

30:46.780 --> 30:48.780
Oh

30:48.780 --> 30:50.780
My hand yeah

31:07.780 --> 31:09.780
I didn't know what this is but

31:09.780 --> 31:11.780
I was like this thing didn't change.

31:11.780 --> 31:13.780
Oh gosh.

31:13.780 --> 31:15.780
Oh my god.

31:15.780 --> 31:17.380
I was so hard.

31:17.380 --> 31:19.380
Ronnie, who was in Paris?

31:19.380 --> 31:21.380
I was in Paris!

31:21.380 --> 31:23.380
I was in Paris!

31:23.380 --> 31:25.380
I was in Paris!

31:25.380 --> 31:29.380
It was just a beach of agency that was lit.

31:29.380 --> 31:35.380
They all couldn't control the urges that they had.

31:35.380 --> 31:39.380
So they danced, the pee-pee danced until they...

31:39.380 --> 31:46.980
Then finally, they peed everywhere on the floor, the walls, the bed, the kind.

31:46.980 --> 31:48.980
We're all filled up.

31:48.980 --> 31:50.980
There's everywhere, but he loved it.

31:50.980 --> 31:56.980
The fact that we got the best prompt before AC came out with that.

31:56.980 --> 31:58.980
He's either going to be AC or not.

31:58.980 --> 32:00.980
AC got a box of booze!

32:00.980 --> 32:02.980
AC in the morn.

32:02.980 --> 32:04.980
Heard.

32:04.980 --> 32:06.980
Sevens character added.

32:06.980 --> 32:08.980
This is so good.

32:09.580 --> 32:10.580
Okay.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.580
Once upon a time, there were whores.

32:12.580 --> 32:14.580
They were the eliters of whores.

32:14.580 --> 32:16.580
Bitches in the wild west.

32:16.580 --> 32:18.580
They all were really cute cowgirls.

32:18.580 --> 32:20.580
Boozy cats.

32:20.580 --> 32:22.580
So cute.

32:22.580 --> 32:24.580
So fuzzy.

32:24.580 --> 32:26.580
So pussy-warm.

32:26.580 --> 32:28.580
Big bang theory.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.580
More like bang-bang your mom last night.

32:30.580 --> 32:32.580
You keep my mom out of your home now.

32:34.580 --> 32:36.580
Sorry.

32:36.580 --> 32:38.580
10 out of 10.

32:39.180 --> 32:41.180
At the time, they were like big thoms.

32:41.180 --> 32:43.180
Oh, no.

32:43.180 --> 32:45.180
Oh, no.

32:49.180 --> 32:51.180
Oh, no.

32:51.180 --> 32:53.180
What's going on?

32:53.180 --> 32:55.180
Big thoms!

32:59.180 --> 33:01.180
What's going on?

33:01.180 --> 33:03.180
What's going on?

33:03.780 --> 33:05.780
No, no, no.

33:06.780 --> 33:08.780
It took a lot!

33:08.780 --> 33:10.780
What's going on?

33:10.780 --> 33:12.780
My face hurts a lot.

33:12.780 --> 33:14.780
This is so bad.

33:18.780 --> 33:20.780
Once upon a time,

33:20.780 --> 33:22.780
she even had to take a nap.

33:22.780 --> 33:24.780
A community zero wrote about each other.

33:24.780 --> 33:26.780
She was sad because she realized

33:26.780 --> 33:28.780
she didn't have a prostate.

33:28.780 --> 33:30.780
I said shit.

33:30.780 --> 33:32.780
No way!

33:32.780 --> 33:35.740
Why do I keep talking about shit all the time?

33:38.740 --> 33:42.140
Alright, this is so bad. I hate this.

33:43.540 --> 33:45.540
Fuck no!

33:47.540 --> 33:50.540
No, I didn't want to be pregnant by Sonic!

33:50.540 --> 33:53.700
Ezra, do you have a make filter on? I can never hear you.

33:53.700 --> 33:54.500
I don't.

33:54.500 --> 33:55.500
Piss me, you don't!

33:55.500 --> 33:56.620
Turn that mic.

33:56.620 --> 33:57.100
Get us!

33:57.100 --> 34:00.700
I don't have a filter on!

34:00.700 --> 34:01.700
No, it's fine!

34:01.700 --> 34:04.700
You don't have a filter on!

34:04.700 --> 34:06.020
There's no filter on?

34:06.020 --> 34:08.020
No, there's no filter on.

34:08.020 --> 34:10.020
You're still series filter.

34:10.020 --> 34:14.020
I don't have a filter. I don't have one on.

34:14.020 --> 34:16.020
Definitely, so you guys can hear it on all my phones.

34:16.020 --> 34:18.020
What is happening?

34:18.020 --> 34:20.020
Hang on.

34:20.020 --> 34:22.020
Can't wait for the board if they survive.

34:22.020 --> 34:24.020
Yeah, these ones, I don't know.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.020
They'll be fine, don't worry about it.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.020
You guys don't play this one or do you want to try another one?

34:28.020 --> 34:30.020
It's peaking.

34:30.020 --> 34:32.020
That was an incomplete drawing.

34:32.020 --> 34:34.020
Please, please, no more shits.

34:34.020 --> 34:36.020
No more shits!

34:36.020 --> 34:38.020
No more shits!

34:38.020 --> 34:40.020
No promises!

34:40.020 --> 34:42.020
No promises, I can't promise.

34:42.020 --> 34:44.020
Did you guys miss stuff?

34:44.020 --> 34:46.020
Did you miss the compliment?

34:46.020 --> 34:48.020
Yeah, I promised that.

34:48.020 --> 34:50.020
Compliment.

34:50.020 --> 34:52.020
All the actions are a mystery.

34:52.020 --> 34:54.020
Drawings and sentences are hidden during this.

34:54.020 --> 34:56.020
You can't hear Mercy?

34:56.020 --> 34:58.020
Sorry, sorry.

34:58.020 --> 35:00.020
Because I was coughing because I was laughing

35:00.020 --> 35:02.020
my side hurts so badly.

35:02.020 --> 35:04.020
No.

35:04.020 --> 35:06.020
Okay, Mercy test complete.

35:06.020 --> 35:08.020
Do you want to do compliment?

35:10.020 --> 35:12.020
What is that?

35:12.020 --> 35:14.020
We draw on each other's drawings, basically.

35:14.020 --> 35:16.020
Oh, we should try that.

35:16.020 --> 35:18.020
I think that would be fun.

35:18.020 --> 35:20.020
Yeah.

35:20.020 --> 35:22.020
We could draw so much piss.

35:22.020 --> 35:24.020
Oh god.

35:24.020 --> 35:26.020
Let's start sketching some basic lines.

35:26.020 --> 35:28.020
Okay.

35:28.020 --> 35:30.020
Let me do this.

35:32.020 --> 35:34.020
Maybe I could just...

35:34.020 --> 35:36.020
Maybe I'll do some basic lines.

35:36.020 --> 35:38.020
Like, ooh.

35:38.020 --> 35:40.020
Okay, boom.

35:42.020 --> 35:44.020
Ooh.

35:44.020 --> 35:46.020
Wait, now I'm just going to draw a bunch of dicks.

35:46.020 --> 35:48.020
The castle.

35:48.020 --> 35:50.020
I can't believe it.

35:50.020 --> 35:52.020
The castle.

35:52.020 --> 35:54.020
No!

35:54.020 --> 35:56.020
Cute.

35:56.020 --> 35:58.020
Blockers.

35:58.020 --> 36:00.020
Oh god.

36:00.020 --> 36:02.020
You know exactly what you did.

36:02.020 --> 36:04.020
And no, I don't have the strength to resist.

36:04.020 --> 36:06.020
What?

36:06.020 --> 36:08.020
Wait, I got it. I got it.

36:08.020 --> 36:10.020
I can make this. I can salvage this.

36:10.020 --> 36:12.020
This is the back legs of it.

36:12.020 --> 36:14.020
And then this is its huge

36:14.020 --> 36:16.020
milkers.

36:20.020 --> 36:22.020
Like...

36:22.020 --> 36:24.020
Oh.

36:24.020 --> 36:26.020
Oh.

36:26.020 --> 36:28.020
Oh.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.020
A big

36:30.020 --> 36:32.020
fish up bruh.

36:32.020 --> 36:34.020
Oh my god, I've just made shimmy up.

36:34.020 --> 36:36.020
What the hell?

36:36.020 --> 36:38.020
What is my name?

36:38.020 --> 36:40.020
Oh wait, that's a thing.

36:40.020 --> 36:42.020
Oh no, that looks like...

36:42.020 --> 36:44.020
Dang it.

36:44.020 --> 36:46.020
Give me the pencil.

36:46.020 --> 36:48.020
There we go.

36:48.020 --> 36:50.020
I saved it.

36:50.020 --> 36:52.020
I saved it.

36:52.020 --> 36:54.020
Baby, give you a lot more time

36:54.020 --> 36:56.020
for the second one.

36:56.020 --> 36:58.020
Yeah, you're to finish it.

36:58.020 --> 37:00.020
Ah, you need to finish it.

37:00.020 --> 37:02.020
Okay, I'm fucking stupid, never mind.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.020
Okay.

37:04.020 --> 37:06.020
So am I, don't worry. Saved it.

37:06.020 --> 37:08.020
Let me look at it.

37:08.020 --> 37:10.020
Help.

37:10.020 --> 37:12.020
Let's put some nice shading in.

37:12.020 --> 37:14.020
To make this look extra beautiful.

37:14.020 --> 37:16.020
Wow.

37:16.020 --> 37:18.020
Let's put lipstick on.

37:18.020 --> 37:20.020
Beautiful.

37:20.020 --> 37:22.020
Yeah.

37:22.020 --> 37:24.020
So beautiful.

37:26.020 --> 37:28.020
I saved it.

37:32.020 --> 37:34.020
They prank him.

37:34.020 --> 37:36.020
I think this is the best one.

37:36.020 --> 37:38.020
Maybe a better one.

37:38.020 --> 37:40.020
Oh, wait.

37:40.020 --> 37:42.020
Who drew a pair of hairy ballsack?

37:42.020 --> 37:44.020
Come on.

37:44.020 --> 37:46.020
What the fuck?

37:46.020 --> 37:48.020
What the fuck?

37:50.020 --> 37:52.020
You have to add the shaft.

37:56.020 --> 37:58.020
I really know what I want to do,

37:58.020 --> 38:00.020
but I know I shouldn't do it

38:00.020 --> 38:02.020
because we're on YouTube.

38:02.020 --> 38:04.020
I'm missing this.

38:04.020 --> 38:06.020
Oh, no.

38:08.020 --> 38:10.020
I can't make one thing.

38:10.020 --> 38:12.020
This is amazing.

38:12.020 --> 38:14.020
Oh, wait, maybe. Hold on.

38:14.020 --> 38:16.020
I got it.

38:16.020 --> 38:18.020
I got it.

38:18.020 --> 38:20.020
I got it.

38:20.020 --> 38:22.020
I gotta go back.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.020
This is so fucking good.

38:36.020 --> 38:38.020
Let's fucking go.

38:40.020 --> 38:42.020
I'm trying so hard right now.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.020
I can't even think of anything to say.

38:44.020 --> 38:46.020
I'm like trying so hard.

38:50.020 --> 38:52.020
Oh, my gosh. Use your imagination.

38:54.020 --> 38:56.020
Use your imagination.

39:04.020 --> 39:06.020
There you go.

39:06.020 --> 39:08.020
I'm so proud of you.

39:12.020 --> 39:14.020
Aww.

39:14.020 --> 39:16.020
Refling.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.020
We need to be nice to the camera.

39:18.020 --> 39:20.020
Your laugh is so fucking lazy.

39:20.020 --> 39:22.020
Thank you.

39:22.020 --> 39:24.020
I got you a six.

39:28.020 --> 39:30.020
I think they did my really well.

39:32.020 --> 39:34.020
Yeah, it's a water bottle.

39:38.020 --> 39:40.020
That's the best I got.

39:42.020 --> 39:42.920
Quick quick quick.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.580
I saved the pair of mall sacs.

39:51.080 --> 39:53.720
Did you make it into a dog or something?

39:53.720 --> 39:55.580
No, it just works.

39:55.580 --> 39:58.860
Can you, Senpais, can you do better, shut the fuck up.

40:01.700 --> 40:02.800
I love when you do that.

40:02.800 --> 40:03.720
Shut the fuck up.

40:03.720 --> 40:05.800
Oh my God.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.800
What is this?

40:07.800 --> 40:09.800
What is this?

40:09.800 --> 40:11.800
I got the hairy mall facts.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.800
What?

40:13.800 --> 40:15.800
Hold on. Give me a second.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.800
You're asking me not to draw a vagina.

40:17.800 --> 40:19.800
What do I do here?

40:19.800 --> 40:21.800
How am I supposed to do this?

40:21.800 --> 40:23.800
What can we do here?

40:23.800 --> 40:25.800
What can we do here?

40:25.800 --> 40:27.800
How do I make this?

40:27.800 --> 40:29.800
How do I save this?

40:29.800 --> 40:31.800
Hmm.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.800
Uh...

40:33.800 --> 40:35.800
Hmm.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.800
Hmm.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.800
Hmm.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.800
Okay.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.800
Okay, I won't draw that.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.800
Because that would be...

40:45.800 --> 40:47.800
Oh my god. I just realized...

40:47.800 --> 40:49.800
I'll draw this in the sky.

40:49.800 --> 40:51.800
Mercy snippets of like fucking Grogu.

40:51.800 --> 40:53.800
Hmm.

40:53.800 --> 40:55.800
From Star Wars.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.800
Oh wait, no. Is it heartbreak on the chair?

40:57.800 --> 40:59.800
I did it! Saved it!

40:59.800 --> 41:01.800
I saved it!

41:01.800 --> 41:03.800
Women were less immature than men.

41:03.800 --> 41:05.800
You're wrong.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.800
I was gonna draw a coochie or a woman giving birth,

41:11.800 --> 41:13.800
but I'm not gonna...

41:13.800 --> 41:15.800
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

41:15.800 --> 41:17.800
I literally don't know what the fuck I'm doing right now.

41:17.800 --> 41:19.800
There you go.

41:19.800 --> 41:21.800
Wait, hold on.

41:21.800 --> 41:23.800
Oh my god, I have time.

41:23.800 --> 41:25.800
One, two, three.

41:25.800 --> 41:27.800
I guess who it is now.

41:27.800 --> 41:29.800
I can do this.

41:29.800 --> 41:31.800
What the fuck I'm doing?

41:31.800 --> 41:33.800
Fuck!

41:41.800 --> 41:43.800
And then pen pals.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.800
Pen pals.

41:45.800 --> 41:47.800
Fuck.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.800
Pen pals.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.800
I'm running out of time.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.800
Oh my god, this is...

41:57.800 --> 41:59.800
And then volcano.

42:03.800 --> 42:05.800
These are light ones.

42:09.800 --> 42:11.800
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.800
I got it, I got it, I got it.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.800
Fuck!

42:17.800 --> 42:19.800
Are you out of...

42:19.800 --> 42:21.800
I don't know, I don't know.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.800
These are light ones!

42:23.800 --> 42:25.800
I did it.

42:25.800 --> 42:27.800
Oh god, refunds.

42:27.800 --> 42:29.800
Refunds, how could I forget your...

42:31.800 --> 42:33.800
I saved it, I saved it!

42:33.800 --> 42:35.800
I think I did a good job.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.800
This is the best I got.

42:37.800 --> 42:39.800
I ain't got nothing.

42:39.800 --> 42:41.800
No!

42:43.800 --> 42:45.800
I don't like this.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.800
Why do I feel like...

42:47.800 --> 42:51.800
This is a really specific reference.

42:51.800 --> 42:53.800
I don't know if anyone's gonna get it,

42:53.800 --> 42:56.800
but there used to be a flash game

42:56.800 --> 42:59.800
where your guy was on like a snowboard.

42:59.800 --> 43:01.800
I love that game!

43:01.800 --> 43:03.800
Yeah, someone should literally just drawn that.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.800
Literally, this is perfect.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.800
That's my drawing.

43:15.800 --> 43:17.800
Someone says lane raider.

43:17.800 --> 43:19.800
Oh, is that what it's called?

43:21.800 --> 43:23.800
Rift.

43:23.800 --> 43:25.800
Rift.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.800
Rift.

43:31.800 --> 43:33.800
What is bear pantsu?

43:33.800 --> 43:35.800
Oh!

43:35.800 --> 43:37.800
Panties.

43:37.800 --> 43:39.800
Panties.

43:41.800 --> 43:43.800
I don't want to weigh all of this.

43:43.800 --> 43:47.800
People were asking me to draw a bear wearing underwear.

43:47.800 --> 43:49.800
I was like, what the fuck is wrong with you guys?

43:49.800 --> 43:51.800
Panties and pants.

43:51.800 --> 43:53.800
I remember fancy pants.

43:53.800 --> 43:57.800
Because he had big old pants that were fancy.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.800
Rain up and now it's not the time.

44:01.800 --> 44:03.800
And you know the story!

44:03.800 --> 44:05.800
Is he blundered or did I make that up?

44:05.800 --> 44:07.800
You know the story!

44:09.800 --> 44:11.800
I might make that up.

44:11.800 --> 44:13.800
I might make that up.

44:17.800 --> 44:19.800
Wait, hydration check, girl.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.800
Is that a one-year-old dying?

44:21.800 --> 44:23.800
Okay.

44:23.800 --> 44:25.800
You know the story.

44:29.800 --> 44:31.800
His pants read.

44:31.800 --> 44:33.800
He's gargling my balls, sorry.

44:33.800 --> 44:35.800
He had no hair color, but his pants read yellow.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.800
Did he have a beard? I don't know.

44:39.800 --> 44:41.800
I'm going to do something.

44:45.800 --> 44:47.800
Needs hip dial.

44:47.800 --> 44:49.800
Yeah, you're right.

44:49.800 --> 44:51.800
I don't really know how to do that though.

44:51.800 --> 44:53.800
Can I zoom in?

44:55.800 --> 44:57.800
Yeah!

44:59.800 --> 45:01.800
Something with a beer braid.

45:01.800 --> 45:03.800
Braid is pantsu?

45:03.800 --> 45:05.800
Wait, it doesn't have pants?

45:05.800 --> 45:07.800
Yeah!

45:07.800 --> 45:09.800
No fuck, I didn't mean to have that.

45:09.800 --> 45:11.800
What is this? Who drew ball sacks everywhere?

45:13.800 --> 45:15.800
It's not you, Shibi.

45:15.800 --> 45:17.800
I only see boobs.

45:17.800 --> 45:19.800
No, I didn't draw a ball sack.

45:23.800 --> 45:25.800
I got it.

45:25.800 --> 45:27.800
Who's whispering?

45:27.800 --> 45:29.800
What? I have no idea.

45:29.800 --> 45:31.800
What? Who's whispering?

45:31.800 --> 45:33.800
Who's whispering?

45:33.800 --> 45:35.800
Who's whispering some evil incantations to us?

45:39.800 --> 45:41.800
Wait, no, that's not nice.

45:41.800 --> 45:43.800
This is all a C right now,

45:43.800 --> 45:45.800
and I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.

45:45.800 --> 45:47.800
It was definitely Azura that drew the ball sack, 100%.

45:49.800 --> 45:51.800
Why do I feel like this is a lie?

45:53.800 --> 45:55.800
No, I didn't draw it.

45:55.800 --> 45:57.800
I'm really drawing over it right now.

45:57.800 --> 45:59.800
If you guys didn't know,

45:59.800 --> 46:01.800
Azura's ears actually have golden

46:01.800 --> 46:03.800
little jewelry on the end of them.

46:03.800 --> 46:05.800
Oh no.

46:05.800 --> 46:07.800
This is icing.

46:07.800 --> 46:09.800
She pimped out with jewelry, but it's like

46:09.800 --> 46:11.800
not a vanity thing.

46:11.800 --> 46:13.800
Here you go. Gifts.

46:13.800 --> 46:15.800
Going for her first bike ride.

46:15.800 --> 46:17.800
Right.

46:17.800 --> 46:19.800
Isn't cheating to erase? Aw, fuck it is.

46:19.800 --> 46:21.800
Isn't it cute?

46:21.800 --> 46:23.800
Right.

46:23.800 --> 46:25.800
So if you didn't know, when a woman

46:25.800 --> 46:27.800
when a woman lactates,

46:27.800 --> 46:29.800
she will have a...

46:29.800 --> 46:31.800
I got it.

46:31.800 --> 46:33.800
It goes through the fabric, okay?

46:33.800 --> 46:35.800
So they'll be like a couple.

46:39.800 --> 46:41.800
I know this isn't Azura's.

46:41.800 --> 46:43.800
Aw, it's terrible.

46:43.800 --> 46:45.800
Get rid of that.

46:45.800 --> 46:47.800
Oh my god.

46:47.800 --> 46:49.800
I want to live with my life.

46:49.800 --> 46:51.800
I was trying to talk about lactation, though.

46:55.800 --> 46:57.800
Yeah, it was right before she said chocolate.

46:57.800 --> 46:59.800
Milk.

46:59.800 --> 47:01.800
Milk.

47:09.800 --> 47:11.800
The best I got.

47:11.800 --> 47:13.800
Shit.

47:13.800 --> 47:15.800
That's the timer.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.800
Oh.

47:19.800 --> 47:21.800
I thought you were drawing a cute bunny face.

47:21.800 --> 47:23.800
Nah, they have some titties, mate.

47:23.800 --> 47:25.800
It's all I can see.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.800
I have saved...

47:27.800 --> 47:29.800
I have single-handedly saved the stream, probably.

47:29.800 --> 47:31.800
Let me do that.

47:31.800 --> 47:33.800
This is supposed to be it.

47:33.800 --> 47:35.800
The liquid.

47:35.800 --> 47:37.800
The liquid.

47:37.800 --> 47:39.800
Oh, I have to draw my own drawing?

47:39.800 --> 47:41.800
Fine.

47:41.800 --> 47:43.800
What is this?

47:43.800 --> 47:45.800
That's nothing!

47:45.800 --> 47:47.800
That's nothing!

47:47.800 --> 47:49.800
Fine.

47:49.800 --> 47:51.800
I don't even know what to draw for my own drawing.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.800
Fine.

47:53.800 --> 47:55.800
I started it,

47:55.800 --> 47:57.800
and I'm going to finish it.

47:57.800 --> 47:59.800
It's me.

47:59.800 --> 48:01.800
Okay, fucking man over here.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.800
I don't know.

48:07.800 --> 48:09.800
I'm already pooped from this.

48:09.800 --> 48:11.800
Just make a little snack.

48:11.800 --> 48:13.800
Just a little snack.

48:13.800 --> 48:15.800
A little whip.

48:17.800 --> 48:19.800
It's the old...

48:19.800 --> 48:21.800
It's the old Mac, okay?

48:23.800 --> 48:25.800
Okay.

48:25.800 --> 48:27.800
Okay.

48:27.800 --> 48:29.800
I would talk, but it takes too much brain power

48:29.800 --> 48:31.800
to do this.

48:31.800 --> 48:33.800
You're a little cheery.

48:33.800 --> 48:35.800
And talk.

48:35.800 --> 48:37.800
Get a little...

48:43.800 --> 48:45.800
Yeah.

48:45.800 --> 48:47.800
Yeah.

48:48.800 --> 48:50.800
Stop!

48:59.800 --> 49:01.800
This is a net.

49:05.800 --> 49:07.800
Yeah.

49:11.800 --> 49:13.800
Pretty good net.

49:13.800 --> 49:15.800
Yeah.

49:15.800 --> 49:17.800
I think I need to grab one.

49:27.800 --> 49:29.800
How do you spell squelch?

49:29.800 --> 49:31.800
Squelch?

49:31.800 --> 49:33.800
Squelch?

49:33.800 --> 49:35.800
Yeah.

49:35.800 --> 49:37.800
Yeah.

49:37.800 --> 49:39.800
Is it the arm that's going?

49:39.800 --> 49:41.800
Oh my god.

49:43.800 --> 49:45.800
Is it the reverse Amazon position

49:45.800 --> 49:47.800
when the girls...

49:47.800 --> 49:49.800
What are you drawing?

49:49.800 --> 49:51.800
Reverse Amazon is like eBay?

49:51.800 --> 49:53.800
Reverse Amazon is like eBay?

49:53.800 --> 49:55.800
Yeah.

49:55.800 --> 49:57.800
That's definitely what it's about.

50:03.800 --> 50:05.800
Wait, any quicker?

50:05.800 --> 50:07.800
Is it hydrate?

50:07.800 --> 50:09.800
No!

50:09.800 --> 50:11.800
Okay, let's see our albums.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.800
Is anybody need to take a quick break

50:13.800 --> 50:15.800
before...

50:15.800 --> 50:17.800
I'm ready.

50:17.800 --> 50:19.800
Let's go.

50:19.800 --> 50:21.800
I'm ready.

50:21.800 --> 50:23.800
Let's do this.

50:23.800 --> 50:25.800
That was yours.

50:25.800 --> 50:27.800
Okay, okay.

50:31.800 --> 50:33.800
What the hell?

50:33.800 --> 50:35.800
What?

50:35.800 --> 50:37.800
Oh, he's...

50:37.800 --> 50:39.800
Okay.

50:39.800 --> 50:41.800
Okay.

50:49.800 --> 50:51.800
Is it Orsor's hand?

50:51.800 --> 50:53.800
Oh my god, I think it's the other...

50:53.800 --> 50:55.800
Yeah, the other me.

50:55.800 --> 50:57.800
Oh, that's so good.

50:57.800 --> 50:59.800
What do you mean you're a bad artist?

50:59.800 --> 51:01.800
That's a very good little bear.

51:01.800 --> 51:03.800
That's beautiful.

51:03.800 --> 51:05.800
That's good.

51:05.800 --> 51:07.800
He got a border under the blanket and everything.

51:09.800 --> 51:11.800
Oh, it's the artist.

51:11.800 --> 51:13.800
Beautiful.

51:17.800 --> 51:19.800
What else could I draw for this?

51:19.800 --> 51:21.800
Oh, that's so cute.

51:21.800 --> 51:23.800
That's so cute.

51:23.800 --> 51:25.800
We're so, so cute.

51:25.800 --> 51:27.800
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

51:29.800 --> 51:31.800
Oh, die.

51:31.800 --> 51:33.800
Die.

51:37.800 --> 51:39.800
I like it.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.800
I did it for his milk.

51:41.800 --> 51:43.800
Open now.

51:49.800 --> 51:51.800
Oh my god.

51:51.800 --> 51:53.800
Oh my god.

51:53.800 --> 51:55.800
I saved them.

51:55.800 --> 51:57.800
I lied.

51:57.800 --> 51:59.800
I didn't save the stream at all.

51:59.800 --> 52:01.800
I was...

52:01.800 --> 52:03.800
If I don't see a snail...

52:03.800 --> 52:05.800
Oh my god.

52:05.800 --> 52:07.800
Oh, shit.

52:07.800 --> 52:09.800
Oh my god.

52:09.800 --> 52:11.800
Oh, that's so cute.

52:11.800 --> 52:13.800
Oh, that's so cute.

52:13.800 --> 52:15.800
Oh, it's mine.

52:15.800 --> 52:17.800
It is.

52:17.800 --> 52:19.800
I love replays.

52:19.800 --> 52:21.800
Oh my god, that's so cute.

52:21.800 --> 52:23.800
Oh.

52:23.800 --> 52:25.800
And then there's me.

52:25.800 --> 52:27.800
And then there's...

52:27.800 --> 52:29.800
I was like, it makes me...

52:29.800 --> 52:31.800
Oh my god.

52:31.800 --> 52:33.800
Mine broke.

52:33.800 --> 52:35.800
Oh my god.

52:35.800 --> 52:37.800
Oh, that's so cute.

52:37.800 --> 52:39.800
Oh.

52:39.800 --> 52:41.800
How is he cute?

52:41.800 --> 52:43.800
Yeah, that was cute.

52:43.800 --> 52:45.800
He's a rat boy.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.800
Oh my god.

52:47.800 --> 52:49.800
Oh, that's so cute.

52:49.800 --> 52:51.800
That's so cute.

52:51.800 --> 52:53.800
Oh.

52:53.800 --> 52:55.800
Oh my god.

52:55.800 --> 52:57.800
That's so cute.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.800
Oh.

52:59.800 --> 53:01.800
Literally me.

53:01.800 --> 53:03.800
That's me.

53:03.800 --> 53:05.800
Oh.

53:05.800 --> 53:07.800
That's mine.

53:07.800 --> 53:09.800
Oh my god.

53:09.800 --> 53:11.800
He's so bad.

53:11.800 --> 53:13.800
I can't show that.

53:13.800 --> 53:15.800
I see.

53:15.800 --> 53:17.800
We'll do it me and the boys.

53:17.800 --> 53:19.800
Oh, okay, okay.

53:23.800 --> 53:25.800
Oh my god, that's so good.

53:25.800 --> 53:27.800
Why the mono bro?

53:27.800 --> 53:29.800
Wait.

53:29.800 --> 53:31.800
Why are you guys...

53:31.800 --> 53:33.800
Oh my god.

53:35.800 --> 53:37.800
Really calm.

53:37.800 --> 53:39.800
Wait, I drew this little game.

53:39.800 --> 53:41.800
I was like, oh, this is a lane ranger.

53:41.800 --> 53:43.800
I like it.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.800
Oh, that's good.

53:45.800 --> 53:47.800
That's creative.

53:47.800 --> 53:49.800
Yeah, that's good.

53:49.800 --> 53:51.800
Oh, I love that.

53:51.800 --> 53:53.800
Oh.

53:53.800 --> 53:55.800
That's really cute.

53:55.800 --> 53:57.800
I love that.

53:57.800 --> 53:59.800
Oh, that's cute.

54:01.800 --> 54:03.800
I told you.

54:03.800 --> 54:05.800
I told you.

54:05.800 --> 54:07.800
I told you.

54:07.800 --> 54:09.800
I love you.

54:09.800 --> 54:11.800
What is this?

54:11.800 --> 54:13.800
Lama Chuba for Gentoo.

54:13.800 --> 54:15.800
I was gonna say that's a good one

54:15.800 --> 54:17.800
and then I saw the thing on the right.

54:19.800 --> 54:21.800
That's cute, Mercy.

54:27.800 --> 54:29.800
I told you.

54:29.800 --> 54:31.800
She's learning how to ride a bike.

54:33.800 --> 54:35.800
What the fuck?

54:35.800 --> 54:37.800
Oh, that was good.

54:37.800 --> 54:39.800
Oh, that was so fucking good.

54:39.800 --> 54:41.800
I ended up being the most innocent.

54:41.800 --> 54:43.800
Oh, that was good.

54:43.800 --> 54:45.800
Oh my god.

54:45.800 --> 54:47.800
Time and stuff.

54:47.800 --> 54:49.800
Help.

54:49.800 --> 54:51.800
I can't breathe.

54:55.800 --> 54:57.800
This is what it's like to be in VLR.

54:57.800 --> 54:59.800
So fucking giving birth!

55:01.800 --> 55:03.800
I want to figure out what icebreaker is.

55:03.800 --> 55:05.800
Icebreaker is kind of boring.

55:05.800 --> 55:07.800
What are we doing?

55:07.800 --> 55:09.800
I'll stop it.

55:09.800 --> 55:11.800
What are we doing?

55:11.800 --> 55:13.800
What?

55:13.800 --> 55:15.800
Icebreaker is kind of boring.

55:15.800 --> 55:17.800
Yeah, it's boring.

55:17.800 --> 55:19.800
Can I cancel it?

55:19.800 --> 55:21.800
If you want.

55:21.800 --> 55:23.800
How do I cancel it?

55:23.800 --> 55:25.800
Wait, are we doing this or are we cancelling it?

55:25.800 --> 55:27.800
I don't know.

55:27.800 --> 55:29.800
I cancel it.

55:29.800 --> 55:31.800
What is happening?

55:31.800 --> 55:33.800
What is happening?

55:33.800 --> 55:35.800
Oh, there's a fucking ad.

55:35.800 --> 55:37.800
I'm just making another room.

55:37.800 --> 55:39.800
I'm making another room.

55:39.800 --> 55:41.800
Okay, okay, okay.

55:41.800 --> 55:43.800
All right.

55:43.800 --> 55:45.800
Where is my carrier that?

55:45.800 --> 55:47.800
You guys can see John Snow and Sansa start.

55:49.800 --> 55:51.800
Wait, no, you put me back in.

55:51.800 --> 55:53.800
They still advertise.

55:55.800 --> 55:57.800
Wait, so do we have a new one?

55:57.800 --> 55:59.800
Do we have a new one?

55:59.800 --> 56:01.800
Yeah, it says one of seven.

56:01.800 --> 56:03.800
Wait, what is happening?

56:03.800 --> 56:05.800
I don't know what is happening.

56:05.800 --> 56:07.800
Somebody else make a lobby.

56:07.800 --> 56:09.800
It's not the greatest, but we can just play it.

56:09.800 --> 56:11.800
No, somebody else make a lobby.

56:13.800 --> 56:15.800
Do we have a new lobby or not?

56:15.800 --> 56:17.800
Somebody else make it because

56:17.800 --> 56:19.800
I made a new one.

56:19.800 --> 56:21.800
I was trying to make a new one.

56:21.800 --> 56:23.800
Everyone, hate the asset.

56:23.800 --> 56:25.800
Hate the game.

56:25.800 --> 56:27.800
The graphic phone window.

56:27.800 --> 56:29.800
And then someone make a new one.

56:29.800 --> 56:31.800
I can't make it because of my connections.

56:31.800 --> 56:33.800
I'll do it.

56:33.800 --> 56:35.800
Okay.

56:35.800 --> 56:37.800
See, Emmy proven what a big girl she is.

56:37.800 --> 56:39.800
That was so fucking weird.

56:39.800 --> 56:41.800
I'm sorry.

56:41.800 --> 56:43.800
So fucking creepy.

56:43.800 --> 56:45.800
I'm so sorry.

56:45.800 --> 56:47.800
Sorry.

56:47.800 --> 56:49.800
It's so chaotic.

56:49.800 --> 56:51.800
I don't know why there's two of me on the screen.

56:51.800 --> 56:53.800
I hate that.

56:53.800 --> 56:55.800
I hate that.

56:55.800 --> 56:57.800
So we are opening in your lobby?

56:57.800 --> 56:59.800
I hate that.

56:59.800 --> 57:01.800
Let me just put up a new one.

57:01.800 --> 57:03.800
She was a link in the discord, you can hate.

57:03.800 --> 57:05.800
Okay, okay, okay.

57:05.800 --> 57:07.800
I understand.

57:07.800 --> 57:09.800
Okay.

57:09.800 --> 57:11.800
Understood.

57:11.800 --> 57:13.800
So, yes sir.

57:13.800 --> 57:15.800
Let me open the link.

57:15.800 --> 57:17.800
There we go, nice and easy.

57:17.800 --> 57:19.800
I'll go Apecha.

57:19.800 --> 57:21.800
Okay, is everyone here?

57:21.800 --> 57:23.800
I'm here.

57:23.800 --> 57:25.800
I'm here.

57:25.800 --> 57:27.800
Yeah, we're here.

57:27.800 --> 57:29.800
Okay, which one do you want to play?

57:29.800 --> 57:31.800
I don't know.

57:31.800 --> 57:33.800
Knock off is fun.

57:33.800 --> 57:35.800
Because it's like, super...

57:35.800 --> 57:37.800
Try to replicate the drawing.

57:37.800 --> 57:39.800
Oh yeah, do knock off.

57:39.800 --> 57:41.800
Do knock off, that looks good.

57:41.800 --> 57:43.800
Okay.

57:43.800 --> 57:45.800
Because you make it pretty drawing and then

57:45.800 --> 57:47.800
it becomes hell.

57:47.800 --> 57:49.800
Wait, why are we supposed to draw?

57:49.800 --> 57:51.800
Anything you want.

57:51.800 --> 57:53.800
Anything?

57:53.800 --> 57:55.800
No, not you.

57:55.800 --> 57:57.800
Maybe not anything for you.

57:57.800 --> 57:59.800
No, not shit.

57:59.800 --> 58:01.800
Please give us something.

58:01.800 --> 58:03.800
I'm being put on the spot, my main's going blank.

58:03.800 --> 58:05.800
Okay, hold on.

58:05.800 --> 58:07.800
Let's do a count.

58:07.800 --> 58:09.800
Cheebie, we can't see.

58:09.800 --> 58:11.800
I'll draw.

58:11.800 --> 58:13.800
I'm taking off the blindfold or fine now.

58:13.800 --> 58:15.800
I'll draw Cheebie.

58:15.800 --> 58:17.800
Should we all just draw somebody?

58:17.800 --> 58:19.800
Oh.

58:19.800 --> 58:21.800
No, I'm joking.

58:21.800 --> 58:23.800
I was like, ooh, I'm kind of locked in now.

58:23.800 --> 58:25.800
Sorry, sorry.

58:25.800 --> 58:27.800
I've decided to draw one of us

58:27.800 --> 58:29.800
that I have already said out loud.

58:29.800 --> 58:31.800
I don't know what to draw.

58:31.800 --> 58:33.800
Guys, give me an idea.

58:33.800 --> 58:35.800
Don't put me on the spot.

58:35.800 --> 58:37.800
Don't put me on the spot, I don't know.

58:37.800 --> 58:39.800
I don't even know what to draw.

58:39.800 --> 58:41.800
Put me on the G-spot.

58:41.800 --> 58:43.800
Oh, one of you guys, so I'm going to choose.

58:43.800 --> 58:45.800
Yeah.

58:45.800 --> 58:47.800
Are you coming for a ride?

58:49.800 --> 58:51.800
This is terrible on a mouse.

58:53.800 --> 58:55.800
That one's actually funny.

58:57.800 --> 58:59.800
How much time do we have?

58:59.800 --> 59:01.800
Can I draw the whole gang again?

59:01.800 --> 59:03.800
I'll make it.

59:03.800 --> 59:05.800
You have quite a bit of time with this one.

59:05.800 --> 59:07.800
Okay, hold on.

59:07.800 --> 59:09.800
What the fuck is the whole gang with this?

59:09.800 --> 59:11.800
Oh, that's not very...

59:15.800 --> 59:17.800
No, no, no, no.

59:21.800 --> 59:23.800
How the fuck do you draw something sitting down?

59:23.800 --> 59:25.800
Oh my God, I'm having a stroke.

59:25.800 --> 59:27.800
I'm not a good guy.

59:27.800 --> 59:29.800
What on earth?

59:29.800 --> 59:31.800
There's a good kind?

59:31.800 --> 59:33.800
I'm supposed to be at the very...

59:35.800 --> 59:37.800
That's close enough.

59:37.800 --> 59:39.800
How do you say after this?

59:39.800 --> 59:41.800
Oh my God.

59:41.800 --> 59:43.800
Oh my God.

59:43.800 --> 59:45.800
I'm going to draw harmony.

59:45.800 --> 59:47.800
I'm going to draw your name.

59:49.800 --> 59:51.800
Perfect. I can't draw like this.

59:51.800 --> 59:53.800
Wait, it has kind of like...

59:53.800 --> 59:55.800
His nickname.

59:55.800 --> 59:57.800
We need to draw the devilish hat.

59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.800
Fuck.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.800
This is hard because I don't know what to fucking draw.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.800
Get creative, nerds.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.800
Jeez, it's not that hard.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.800
I'm doing it.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.800
I'm playing dead, okay?

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.800
Okay, Miss Artis.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.800
I'm playing dead.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.800
I'm just going to draw myself casual

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.800
and it comes out with this fucking banger of a commission.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.800
It would probably cost like $500 to do.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.800
And I'm like, oh my God.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.800
I'm going to make a VTuber model.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.800
Don't ask the way.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.800
I wish I could...

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.800
I'm doing a figure-nerval talent.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.800
Speaking of that,

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:45.800
send me a fucking marshmallow.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.800
They were like, thank you for not tying down

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.800
your talents to the designs

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.800
that you assigned them and they can be more themselves.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.800
And I'm like, yeah, well,

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.800
why would I do that?

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.800
I was like, I don't know why.

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.800
I feel like it's such a basic thing.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.800
What the fuck do I need to draw next?

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.800
A bleeding heart.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:05.800
Yeah, we're more like building upon

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.800
characters rather than

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.800
changing everything.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.800
Oh, someone rated the VTuber.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.800
They were like, the only thing that would have

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:17.800
been better is if you let them design

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.800
their models.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.800
From the start, I'm like, bro, it took me

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.800
a fucking year to get here.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.800
Oh my God, give me...

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.800
It takes forever to...

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.800
It is not like an overnight thing.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.800
Draw and rig a VTuber model.

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.800
You can ask Amy.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.800
She knows how to do it.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.800
It's a lot of work.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.800
Oh my God.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:43.800
Yeah, there's only a select few corpos

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.800
that will let you do that.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.800
It literally takes a little long.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.800
Oh shit. Oh shit.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.800
Man, this is rough.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.800
Usually ones that have like artists in house

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.800
are like...

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.800
Yeah, we don't.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.800
This is so bad.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.800
Most companies, if not all of them,

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.800
say first, you

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.800
will have

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.800
pre-made

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.800
pre-made.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.800
So it's not actually standard

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.800
for people to choose.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.800
Yeah, it's really not.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.800
That's why it's usually they

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.800
cast for the roles.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.800
You have to fit the character they're looking for

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.800
and have the voice.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.800
Oh.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.800
There.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.800
What the fuck is that?

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.800
Stop.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.800
Oh, it looks like an abomination.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.800
Oh.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.800
Oh no.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.800
I'm complicated.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.800
What is this?

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.800
Fuck.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.800
Okay.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.800
I like how cute this is.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.800
Okay.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.800
Okay, now we have to draw it.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.800
Are we ready?

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.800
Yeah.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.800
No, but...

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.800
I have to be...

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.800
I have to be ready for it.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.800
Even if I'm not...

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.800
It's okay.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.800
Just draw it your way

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.800
and that's the fun part.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.800
Yeah. Very nice.

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.800
I've already forgot which position everyone...

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.800
Fuck.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.800
Bro, this is so bad.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.800
Sorry, we flinched honestly.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.800
I would talk more, but this takes so much brain power

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.800
to do this.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.800
I'm so brain dead.

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.800
I feel so bad.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.800
I'm like dying.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.800
I'm reading chat, I'm reading everything,

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:52.800
but I'm not responding.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.800
I'm so sorry.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.800
I can see everyone and see what you're all saying.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.800
I'm just really in this.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.800
I feel like I'm just...

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.800
Fuck, I'm just fucking losing it.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.800
Oh my god, wait!

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.800
I forgot there was a shorter time!

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.800
Fuck!

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.800
That's far too short, so it's...

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.800
This is why it's chaotic.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.800
Why was the other one longer?

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.800
I don't remember what...

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.800
Ah!

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.800
Oh my god, what?

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.800
What is this?

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.800
Okay.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.800
Okay.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.800
I have no clue what it was.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.800
Okay, okay, okay.

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.800
Okay.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.800
Fuck, the time!

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.800
We draw this as fast as we can.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.800
Oh fuck!

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.800
Ah!

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.800
No, no, no, no!

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.800
Not like this!

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.800
Shit, shit, shit!

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.800
I can't remember what it looked like.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.800
Is there supposed to be someone in a pirate boat, by the way?

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.800
Because I don't think I saw it.

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.800
Is there supposed to be a person in it?

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.800
I don't know, it's already gone.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.800
It's just a person.

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.800
It's supposed to...

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.800
It's supposed to go really fast, so it...

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.800
Oh my god!

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:23.800
Okay, that's easy enough.

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.800
That's easy enough.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.800
Oh, it's already up!

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.800
Okay.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.800
Gotta go fast, gotta go fast!

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.800
Gotta go fast!

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.800
Faster, faster, oh fuck.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.800
Faster, faster!

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.800
Ah!

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:43.800
Oh my god, I am so sorry.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.800
Come on.

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.800
Faster, oh!

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.800
Faster!

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.800
Faster!

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.800
Ah!

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.800
Okay, okay, okay.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.800
Oh, hey, it's me.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:59.800
Why is it so flat?

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.800
Oh no, no, no!

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.800
Okay, okay, okay, okay, we can do this, we can do this.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.800
We can do this.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.800
Okay, okay, okay.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:10.800
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.800
Don't panic, don't panic.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.800
The great part is that we are all panicking.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.800
Oh no, no, no, no!

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.800
One more time.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.800
One more time.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.800
What is this?

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.800
What even is that?

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.800
Okay, this is easy, this is easy, easy, easy.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.800
This has to be mittens, this has to be mittens.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.800
Easy, easy, easy.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.800
Was it blue? I can't remember blue.

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.800
Let's fucking go.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.800
Man, this looks like shade, but oh wow.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.800
I mean, that's close enough.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.800
Oh my god.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.800
That's close enough.

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.800
Oh my god.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.800
That's amazing.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.800
I love this.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.800
What does her have all the time?

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.800
I did not have any time for this.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.800
I was like, this is Mr. Min.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.800
This is Mr. Min.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.800
At least it's me and the cat.

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.800
Oh my god.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.800
I'm excited to cat.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.800
That's a little campfire with all of us together.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.800
That's fucking cute.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.800
That's a little campfire with all of us together.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.800
That's a little campfire with all of us together.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.800
That's fucking cute.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.800
I don't have time.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.800
I don't have time.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.800
That's what it's supposed to be.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.800
I'm stuck.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.800
I'm stuck in the face.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.800
I'm stuck in the face.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.800
I'm stuck in the face.

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.800
I'm stuck in the face.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.800
I'm stuck in the face.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.800
I'm stuck in the face.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.800
That's so good.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.800
At the end of the day,

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.800
we're all just suffering here.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.800
This is good.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:22.800
This stayed good.

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:34.800
That's perfect circle.

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:50.440
I was getting more and more depressed, somebody said.

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:53.880
Oh, she's not in jail.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.920
She's at the cage.

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:58.240
I thought she was in jail.

01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.720
OK, that's fine.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.720
I get it.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.200
Oh, my god.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.680
She was under arrest.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:13.400
I love this.

01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:16.400
Help.

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.400
It's back down.

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:21.800
She broke her jail by the end.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.800
Oh, my goodness.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:26.800
She's free.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:27.800
Wow.

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.800
I love all the details.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.800
One piece.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.800
I was like, why the heck are we doing this?

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.800
I was like, what the heck are we doing here?

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:42.800
I was like, stop me.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:43.800
Oh, no.

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.800
I was just getting ugly.

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.800
I was trying to draw the line.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:52.800
Oh, my god.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.800
I was trying to draw the line on it.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.800
I was like, I can't.

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.800
I was like, oh.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:16.800
She was shooting her piss.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.800
Wait, that's supposed to be me?

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.800
Are you kissing as a girl?

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:28.800
You're giving the rest of the piss it needs to serve her?

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.800
The piss will revive him.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:32.800
Oh.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:35.800
The piss will revive him.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.800
Oh, my god.

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.800
Oh, it's still good, right?

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.800
One more.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.800
One more.

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:49.800
Which one?

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.800
One more.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.800
Give us one more.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.800
One more.

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.800
One more.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.800
What would have we not done?

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.800
I don't know.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:03.800
I don't remember.

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.800
Secret.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:05.800
All the actions are a mystery.

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:08.800
Drawing incentives are hitting during the game.

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.800
What's secret?

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.800
Secret seems rough.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.800
I've never done that one before.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.800
All right, since they're a mystery.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:17.800
OK.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:18.800
We'll try it.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:19.800
We'll try it.

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.800
Last friend, boys.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.800
Last friend.

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:24.800
OK, OK, OK.

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:25.800
Oh, shit.

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:26.800
Oh, what?

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:27.800
I can't see what I'm writing.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:28.800
Oh, secret.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.800
How am I supposed to know what I'm writing?

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.800
Wait, what?

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:35.800
Huh?

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:36.800
Yeah.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:37.800
Oh, no, wait.

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.800
You run out of freaking words?

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.800
Oh, bro.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.800
I can't erase my things.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.800
I don't know.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:48.800
What is this?

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:50.800
Of course.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.800
What is this?

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.800
What is happening?

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.800
It just appears.

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.800
Oh, we can't see what we're drawing.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:00.800
What?

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:01.800
OK, we'll draw fast.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:02.800
We'll draw fast.

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.800
What the fuck?

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:07.800
OK.

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:08.800
OK.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:09.800
I don't know.

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:15.800
I think I'm going to just guess what it is, where it is.

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:16.800
That's so funny.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.800
Oh, god.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.800
What the fuck?

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:26.800
Oh, no, no.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.800
I'm going to try to draw.

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.800
Why is it so hard to draw with a bow?

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.800
What is that?

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:34.800
OK.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.800
OK.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:40.800
OK.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:41.800
I failed that.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:42.800
Oh, no.

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:45.800
I didn't finish it.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.800
Oh, come on.

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.800
What the fuck?

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.800
What?

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.800
What does that even mean?

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:54.800
What the fuck?

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:55.800
What does that even mean?

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.800
What the fuck?

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.800
I think it's so sad.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:00.800
OK.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:01.800
OK.

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:02.800
OK.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.800
Oh, fuck.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.800
Oh, fuck.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.800
I don't know what else to draw.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:12.800
That's exactly what I drew, I think.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.800
Is this a vain reference?

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.800
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.800
Locked in.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:20.800
I locked in.

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:21.800
Did I give...

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:22.800
Wait, I spelled that wrong.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.800
Wait, did I give them bodies?

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:26.800
Oh, my God.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.800
I don't even know where they are.

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.800
I don't know.

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.800
Taking a shot in the dark.

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.800
Where do you know what that is going to be interpreted as?

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.800
And will I stop the creative flow?

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.800
Do you stop?

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:41.800
Oh, my God.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:42.800
No.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:43.800
Emmy's got a hoodie here.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:44.800
Oh, sugar.

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:45.800
I don't...

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:46.800
Fucking...

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.800
I put juice on her right now.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.800
I don't fucking know.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:57.800
I didn't even know what the fuck I'm doing anymore.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.800
I'm fucking dying.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.800
What is this?

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.800
What is this?

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.800
What is this?

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.800
What?

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.800
What is happening?

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:11.800
What is this?

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.800
Someone had a stroke.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.800
Could you ever do this one?

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.800
Hope you're feeling OK.

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:16.800
Hope you're doing all right.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.800
Make sure you hydrate.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.800
Fuck, I didn't have enough time to write it.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.800
Oh, man.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.800
How do I even draw this?

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.800
This is...

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.800
That's the tongue.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.800
This is literally everywhere.

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.800
Wait.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.800
Okay, this is so difficult.

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.800
Fuck am I drawing?

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:56.800
I need like motion swipes as well.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.800
And a little arrow to indicate.

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.800
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.800
I don't know.

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:03.800
Yeah, there we go.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.800
I think I drew it correctly.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:06.800
A little bit of lips.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.800
Cute?

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:09.800
Cute?

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.800
I don't know.

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:11.800
I just drew anything.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.800
I don't know.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.800
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.800
I just drew everything.

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:18.800
What did you say?

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:21.800
I can't wait to see the end of this.

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.800
Yeah, you're all in trouble.

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:25.800
This is going to be something else.

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.800
This is going to be fucking interesting.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.800
What's going on in the ceiling?

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.800
Oh, I need to draw on the ceiling quick.

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:33.800
Oh, I think I just drew it.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:34.800
Oh, God.

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.800
Oh, boy.

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.800
I'm so scared of what these look like.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.800
Same.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.800
Are you serious?

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.800
What the fuck?

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.800
Oh, my God.

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.800
I think she's beautiful.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.800
I was like, oh, you're not okay.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:57.800
I completely missed the book.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.800
She's fucking going.

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.800
What are you doing?

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:05.800
I was going to write.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:10.800
I was going to write even being cooked.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:15.800
It looked like she was on a stick that's rotating.

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.800
No.

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:27.800
Oh, that's why you were humming Indiana Jones.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:30.800
I was like, where did that come from?

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.800
I was trying to write cowboy, but I didn't fit it.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.800
Oh, that's so normal.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:39.800
I'm kidding.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.800
Wait, where's my coin?

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.800
Oh, my God.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:17:01.800
I used the color black and I used red as well.

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:03.800
And orange.

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.800
Oh, my God.

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:07.800
What is my one?

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.800
What the fuck?

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.800
I can't read.

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.800
Oh, my face.

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.800
Snowcow.

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.800
Hey.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.800
How are you?

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.800
Wait, wait, wait.

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.800
Oh, my God.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.800
I used the fucking eraser.

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:27.800
That's why you're going to fucking see it.

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.800
I'm so sorry.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.800
I'm so sorry.

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.800
I'm so sorry.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.800
I'm so sorry.

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.800
I'm so sorry.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:39.800
Oh, my God.

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.800
I'm so sorry.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.800
I'm sorry.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.800
How did I get back to Boob?

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.800
That's not the right way to run.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.800
Oh, my God.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.800
Oh, my God.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.800
Well, actually, that potato was really bad.

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.800
Never mind.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:57.800
Oh, wholesome.

01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.800
You'll learn number one.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.800
Wait, I don't know.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:03.800
Oh, it's not Earth 3D closer.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.800
No.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.800
Oh my god.

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.800
Oh my god.

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.800
Oh my god.

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.800
Oh my god.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.800
Oh my god.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.800
Oh my god.

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.800
Oh my god.

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:21.800
Oh my god.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.800
Oh my god.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.800
Oh my god.

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.800
Oh, this is amazing.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.800
That's what we got there.

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:31.800
That book.

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.800
Oh, they drew us.

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.800
Your mom called me.

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:37.800
Your mom called me.

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.800
Oh it's sexy.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.800
That's so good.

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.800
OH MY GOD.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.800
That's so sick.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:01.800
Oh my god.

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.920
Oh, my God.

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.400
My cheeks hurt from this moment.

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:07.360
Same.

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:08.360
My jaw hurts.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:11.680
Oh, okay, okay.

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.520
Ah!

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.360
Ah!

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.180
Ah!

01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:17.020
Ah!

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:17.860
Ah!

01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:18.700
Ah!

01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:19.520
Ah!

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:20.360
Ah!

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.200
Ah!

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:22.020
Ah!

01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:22.860
Ah!

01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:23.700
Ah!

01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:24.520
Ah!

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:25.360
Ah!

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.200
Ah!

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.020
Ah!

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:27.860
Ah!

01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:28.700
Ah!

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:29.520
Ah!

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.360
Ah!

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.640
Oh, by a train!

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:32.640
Oh, my God.

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:33.480
Oh!

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:34.320
Oh!

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.160
Oh!

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.000
Oh!

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:36.840
Oh!

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.520
Somebody download that one.

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.640
Oh, my God.

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:43.280
That's fucking amazing.

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:44.120
Oh!

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:47.200
That's so fucking funny.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.040
I love this.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.880
What a guy's permission.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.440
That train.

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.040
That train is bad.

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.080
It's not the premium pass.

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:56.920
That is bad.

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:59.000
It's not the premium pass.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.640
As you see at the convention,

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:02.080
they got the premium pass.

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.100
That train.

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:03.940
Me.

01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:04.760
Me.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:06.580
Hahaha!

01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:08.600
Tag yourself on the ropes.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.060
Tying me to the tracks.

01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:13.120
Oh, my God.

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:13.940
Oh, my God.

01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:14.780
Holy shit.

01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:16.200
I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.240
endure the girls to anything more

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:19.800
because like, our faces are ready

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.620
to fall off after that.

01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:24.680
Is anyone doing a stream?

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.520
Me, I am.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.340
Is anyone?

01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:27.380
Are you doing a stream?

01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:28.220
No.

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:29.900
I need to pee really bad.

01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:30.400
Right.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.900
I'm going to jump out of the call.

01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:36.540
And I'm going to jump out of the call.

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:38.980
Man, now I'm sick of my new piss off.

01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:39.480
I know.

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:39.980
I know.

01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:42.140
Let's win it.

01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:44.860
I am going to jump out of the call

01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:45.940
and do a little satsuthe.

01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:48.620
And I'll redirect into Yuzuru, OK?

01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:49.120
OK.

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.820
I'm going to be in Stardil.

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:52.620
OK.

01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:53.540
I might play.

01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:54.420
Do you guys want me?

01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:56.180
I might play some Call of the Lamb.

01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:59.220
If someone does a pop-up stream, just tell me.

01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:01.100
I'll talk to my reef ones for a bit.

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:03.900
Thank you so, so much, all members and dolls,

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:06.620
for this hilarity that ensued after such a miserable start.

01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:07.460
This was amazing.

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:11.980
The art that such a miserable start to power water.

01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:14.300
Shat myself for laughing so hard.

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:16.020
Oh, no.

01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:18.100
We already know Aces panties are soaked.

01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:20.940
So let's not laugh.

01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:22.460
And Amy, probably?

01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:23.860
No.

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.860
No.

01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:26.460
All right.

01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:27.620
Let me sniff.

01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:30.100
Let me sniff test.

01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:31.980
Don't do the sniff test.

01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:33.540
Rather pungent, my dear.

01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:35.500
My bridge just cut out.

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:36.580
You have to take a test.

01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:40.580
Like she just disintegrated.

01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:42.780
Oh, my god.

01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:43.180
Right.

01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:44.380
I'm going to jump out of chat.

01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:45.060
Thank you so much.

01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:46.220
OK, OK, OK.

01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:48.700
We'll be doing collabs next week with each other.

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:51.180
So look out for that.

01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:52.220
And I'll jump out of chat.

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:53.180
Thank you so much.

01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:55.580
My darlings, my daughters, my girls.

01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:57.340
I'll talk to you very shortly, OK?

01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:58.540
I'm off to the refunds.

01:21:58.540 --> 01:21:59.580
I love you, my daughters.

01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:02.980
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:06.060
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:08.900
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:11.700
OK, all these girls.

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:14.180
These are the yellow girl.

01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:17.140
Yeah.

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:19.220
They're so cute, right?

01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:21.660
You know, you're still in call.

01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:23.980
That was really something.

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:26.700
Wait, are you guys still streaming?

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:27.540
Yeah, I am.

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:28.420
I am, yeah.

01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:30.260
I don't know what to do.

01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:32.260
I feel like I lost my ability to stream.

01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:33.620
You got to go off.

01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:34.540
OK, let's go off.

01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:38.140
Go to Jeff Channing and then raid into Azra.

01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:40.100
I think Azra's next, right?

01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:40.980
Yeah, I'm going to be.

01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:42.420
I'll see you, but.

01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:44.260
Me and Azra are going to be streaming.

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:45.380
She's doing Stardew.

01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:47.300
I'm doing Call of the Limb.

01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:48.420
Wait, wait.

01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:51.500
So Shibi and Azra are going to stream right now?

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.660
Yeah, I'm going to keep streaming.

01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:56.580
I'm probably going to end this one

01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:59.020
so that the bot is separated.

01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:01.780
Oh, yeah, actually, I'll end it.

01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:04.020
We can do one.

01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:09.100
OK, hang up and then I'll go to the just chatting

01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:10.380
and then I'll send.

01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:12.180
I'll check if y'all ready.

01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:15.020
OK, let me just go.

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:16.900
Bye bye.

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:18.940
Bye bye.

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:19.780
Bye bye.

01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:23.260
Hey, guys, that was that was fun.

01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:26.380
I'm going to we're going to do a early stream

01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:28.300
because why not?

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:31.100
Since I'm already streaming, I was going to take a break,

01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:32.620
but that was really fast.

01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:36.700
I like in between.

01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:37.620
I'm so sorry.

01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:40.420
I wasn't talking much.

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:43.700
I'm trying to find the group calling you to get rid of that.

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:44.500
I'm so sorry.

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.460
I wasn't talking much.

01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:47.420
I'm so sorry.

01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:50.620
I wasn't talking much.

01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:53.140
I wasn't talking very much.

01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:56.060
I spent the majority of it laughing too hard.

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:03.820
I was laughing too hard the entire time.

01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:06.100
OK, I'm going to end this bot.

01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:08.500
OK, in this video, I'm never going

01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:10.140
to start up the stardo stream.

01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:13.220
OK, so I'll see you guys in just a few minutes.

01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:13.740
Sorry.

01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:20.460
We'll be streaming pretty much all day.

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:28.740
At least you got plenty of talk for the next stream.

01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:29.260
Yeah.

01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:33.540
Yeah.

01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:36.140
OK, bye bye, everyone.

01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:37.180
That was fun.

01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:40.260
See you in a few, in a few minutes.

01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:42.140
Bye.

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:43.180
Bye.
