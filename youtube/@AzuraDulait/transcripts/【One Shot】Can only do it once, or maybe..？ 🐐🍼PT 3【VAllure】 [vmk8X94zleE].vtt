04:15.320 --> 04:17.320
It was like badly burnt.

04:17.320 --> 04:19.320
When I tried to take it off,

04:19.320 --> 04:21.320
take it off of the foil,

04:21.320 --> 04:23.320
it was like sticking to it.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.320
It was like as it feel it,

04:25.320 --> 04:27.320

I have no money.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.320
I have no money.

04:40.320 --> 04:43.320

04:43.320 --> 04:46.320

04:47.320 --> 04:50.320
So yeah, I'll have a toaster.

04:57.320 --> 04:59.320
I can't get a toaster.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.320

05:01.320 --> 05:03.320

05:06.320 --> 05:08.320

05:08.320 --> 05:11.320

ʀk ʀ�कᦀ ʀ� mondo ʏ detailed how

07:42.560 --> 07:56.000
mine decided to make toast yeah i think i was sleeping when this happened i don't remember where i was

07:56.000 --> 08:07.520
i just know i was in my room i was in my room i was in my room having a good time doing whatever

08:07.600 --> 08:14.800
i was doing aki but then all of a sudden i smelled something it smelled

08:17.280 --> 08:21.520
it smelled like fire fire where's that smoke

08:24.080 --> 08:29.920
what's that what what i gotta go check it out

08:29.920 --> 08:42.800
so i get up and i open my door and then a huge cloud of gray smoke fills my room

08:43.600 --> 08:46.720
the entire ceiling is covered in smoke

08:49.200 --> 08:57.600
the entire ceiling is covered in smoke and i had to bend down and walk all the way to the kitchen

08:58.240 --> 09:00.000
to see what the heck happened

09:05.760 --> 09:13.920
i go into the the the kitchen and there my sibling is coming out of their room at the same time

09:14.560 --> 09:21.680
and we we both walk in there together and i'm like what the heck's going on why is there smoke

09:21.760 --> 09:27.120
what's going on and they were like i was making toast

09:30.480 --> 09:37.280
we're like toast that's the toaster and then we go in there and then there's more smoke

09:38.480 --> 09:45.120
spewing out of the toaster spewing out of the toaster

09:45.200 --> 09:57.120
so for like a couple of years before this incident our toaster was actually broken

09:58.080 --> 10:05.040
it was broken for like a couple of years every time you push the toaster down every now and then

10:05.680 --> 10:12.720
the button doesn't come back up so the toaster would stay on even if the timer was over

10:12.800 --> 10:15.840
it didn't pop pop pop back up so

10:18.720 --> 10:24.640
it was like rule of thumb not to leave the toaster when when you make toast but

10:25.440 --> 10:31.520
i think in between the time it was broken and the incident it was working for a little bit

10:32.800 --> 10:39.520
so my sibling left the toaster alone with the toast and forgot about it

10:43.040 --> 10:54.640
so yeah um when uh when we got to the toaster

10:59.920 --> 11:06.480
we got to the toaster um my sibling popped the toaster out

11:07.440 --> 11:14.000
popped the toast out and it was black like charred like it looked like charcoal

11:14.800 --> 11:21.120
it looked like burning charcoal the center was a little like little grayish but it was

11:21.760 --> 11:26.880
like it looked like magma in the center like in the very very center it looked like

11:27.520 --> 11:34.720
it was like bubbling and popping in the center of the of the toast of the now charcoal bread

11:36.880 --> 11:44.320
it was it was it was like bubbling and popping my my my sibling took it out with a like

11:45.200 --> 11:51.680
they tried to use their like hand and it was too hot so they used an oven mat

11:53.200 --> 11:59.920
and they pulled it out with the oven mat and then the oven mat caught fire yeah

12:06.480 --> 12:09.920
so

12:19.200 --> 12:21.920
and we haven't had a toaster since

12:28.720 --> 12:29.680
no toaster

12:30.240 --> 12:31.120
okay

12:35.120 --> 12:38.480
let me add a toaster oven i'm not really sure what happened to that one

12:40.080 --> 12:45.120
it just disappeared i went in there one day to make me a toaster and it was gone

12:49.360 --> 12:56.160
so we don't own a toaster or a toaster oven but someone got us a toaster on throw now

12:56.160 --> 13:03.360
so yay we'll we'll have a toaster i'll have a toaster again i can make toast normally

13:09.200 --> 13:09.600
yay

13:14.000 --> 13:18.480
make sure no fires occur i'll just i'll just keep the toaster in my room

13:18.800 --> 13:25.280
i don't want my sibling to come asking to make toast

13:27.840 --> 13:34.880
i think the reason why the old toaster broke was because people forced it to pop you know how you

13:34.880 --> 13:41.680
push the pop button up and it will pop um not a lot of toasters are designed to do that

13:43.040 --> 13:43.920
so i think

13:44.320 --> 13:52.400
i think uh i think they broke it by doing that so i'm afraid of of leaving the new one in there

13:52.400 --> 13:55.360
and them doing that again

14:03.120 --> 14:12.160
so they um and broke it perfect the toaster i have molts and hot toast yeah it's not the first time

14:12.240 --> 14:17.280
it's not the first time we had a fire though yeah we had a fire a couple of times

14:18.400 --> 14:20.560
um in this house in this house

14:23.920 --> 14:25.920
i'll show you guys if i want to hear about that

14:42.560 --> 14:53.360
yeah a couple of times yeah

14:57.280 --> 14:59.040
here you go my lips are a little dry

15:00.400 --> 15:06.000
oh yeah put this on my lips yeah we had a few fires

15:12.400 --> 15:16.000
so

15:26.560 --> 15:28.320
some of them were accidental

15:34.960 --> 15:36.880
there's no way to sound on my internet

15:37.440 --> 15:43.600
it keeps going on and off it's gone again

15:48.560 --> 15:49.360
it's back again

15:52.880 --> 15:55.680
but it's not my internet internet what the heck

15:56.640 --> 15:58.960
this is not my actual internet i'm watching it

16:00.720 --> 16:05.440

16:07.280 --> 16:12.800

16:36.880 --> 16:48.240
um

16:49.600 --> 16:56.480
but yeah a few of the uh incidents were accidents and maybe one of them was like a

16:59.840 --> 17:01.200

mm-hmm

17:04.960 --> 17:07.360

24:32.140 --> 24:35.140
and I only told you guys about

24:35.140 --> 24:38.140
the people whom I was raised around

24:43.140 --> 24:44.140
yes

24:44.140 --> 24:47.140
my accent is adopted from

24:47.140 --> 24:51.140
various other ethnicities, cultures

24:51.140 --> 24:53.140
and nationalities

24:53.140 --> 24:55.140
yes

24:59.140 --> 25:03.140
would you want to know what my main accent was at first?

25:05.140 --> 25:07.140
do you want to

25:08.140 --> 25:10.140
know

25:10.140 --> 25:12.140
my headphones just turned off on me

25:12.140 --> 25:14.140
would bogus?

25:14.140 --> 25:15.140
hang on

25:17.140 --> 25:19.140
who dare you

25:21.140 --> 25:23.140
come back

25:27.140 --> 25:29.140
eh?

25:34.140 --> 25:36.140
rude

25:41.140 --> 25:43.140
it just turned off on me

25:44.140 --> 25:46.140
yeah

25:52.140 --> 25:55.140
you want to know my original accent?

25:55.140 --> 25:57.140
no one that's underneath it all

26:02.140 --> 26:05.140
my original accent is actually southern

26:13.140 --> 26:15.140
yeah

26:35.140 --> 26:37.140
am I from there?

26:37.140 --> 26:39.140
no

26:39.140 --> 26:41.140
my family is though

26:41.140 --> 26:43.140
but they moved

26:43.140 --> 26:45.140
and my family has

26:45.140 --> 26:47.140
the accent

26:47.140 --> 26:50.140
it kind of goes down a few generations before it disappears

26:50.140 --> 26:53.140
and it's kind of going with me

26:59.140 --> 27:02.140
so because

27:02.140 --> 27:05.140
my family have all of them have

27:05.140 --> 27:08.140
a southern accent

27:11.140 --> 27:14.140
I have adopted that as well

27:35.140 --> 27:37.140
wow

27:38.140 --> 27:41.140
is it that unbelievable?

27:42.140 --> 27:45.140
is it that unbelievable?

27:53.140 --> 27:56.140
just when I tell you all the people you grew up around

27:57.140 --> 28:01.140
I couldn't imagine anywhere all those types of people could be

28:08.140 --> 28:10.140
wait

28:10.140 --> 28:12.140
wait

28:12.140 --> 28:14.140
what is this?

28:14.140 --> 28:16.140
what is this?

28:16.140 --> 28:18.140
what is this?

28:38.140 --> 28:41.140

28:59.140 --> 29:01.140

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.500
I can't see her.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.500
Yes.

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:09.500
She made me pancakes.

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:13.500
What?

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:19.500
I think it was my birthday.

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:26.500
Because people always get their favorite food on their birthdays.

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:41.500
I remember my birthdays, they sucked really badly.

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:45.500
I get a little emotional when it comes to birthdays.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:52.500
My birthday was always forgotten.

01:14:52.500 --> 01:15:02.500
My birthday was forgotten for 3-4 years straight in a row.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:14.500
A whole lot of it.

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:17.500
Do you have a birthday?

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.500
I do.

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:24.500
It's August 21st.

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:32.500
August 24th.

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:35.500
Oh, accidentally.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:42.500
Where's that?

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:44.500
Yes, I do.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.500
Oh, then what's your favorite food?

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.500
Is it pancakes?

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:52.500
Wait, do you like pancakes?

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.500
I do.

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:57.500
Yes, me too.

01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:01.500
On my last birthday, I ate two of them.

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:02.500
So many.

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:06.500
I was so full I didn't eat anything else that day.

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:10.500
But you're telling her, be careful.

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:18.500
It's so much, you're telling her.

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.500
We won't regret it.

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.500
I hope you won't.

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.500
Thank you.

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:28.500
Thank you everyone.

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.500
You have it on your calendar.

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:33.500
Yay.

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:41.500
Yeah, no birthday for 3 years.

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:51.500
Yes, it's my day of creation.

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:55.500
My mama makes the best packets.

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:58.500
And some of the neighbors make really good noodles.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:02.500
My mom made the best oatmeal.

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:11.500
It was mostly my grandma's oatmeal.

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:14.500
She made it with absolute love.

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.500
I don't know how she did it.

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:21.500
We don't know what her secret ingredient was and we'll never know.

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:26.500
All we can do is experiment and see if we can get it to taste the same.

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:30.500
There's just no way we can ever get it to taste the same.

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:35.500
So my mom's oatmeal came in second.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:40.500
It was close, very close enough to it.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:55.500
It was my favorite food that she would make.

01:17:55.500 --> 01:18:01.500
Oh, one of our neighbors makes a lot of bread.

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:10.500
Bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread.

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.500
Do you have any neighbors?

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.500
Yeah, they're kind of them.

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:15.500
They're great.

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:21.500
I like my neighbors so much.

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.500
Good neighbors.

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:31.500
Well, one of them is actually a really, really good neighbor.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.500
She's a sweetheart.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:37.500
A really, really old lady.

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:40.500
Really, really old lady.

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:43.500
Sweetheart.

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.500
Yes.

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.500
Oh, do they share their food with you?

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.500
She used to, not anymore.

01:18:51.500 --> 01:19:05.500
Now she comes over and asks if we have sugar to lend or a roll of toilet paper.

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.500
I guess I'll say no.

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:11.500
It's been years since then, since we last shared.

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:14.500
We're the ones that share food with her now.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:25.500
Whenever we have big events and stuff, we'll make a supper plate for her and give it to her.

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:30.500
Such as I know her, yes.

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:34.500
Since it's an occasional thing and she doesn't share food with us.

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.500
We share food with her.

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:47.500
Yeah, they say no.

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.500
They say no.

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.500
It's not very nice of them.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:55.500
It's true.

01:19:55.500 --> 01:20:01.500
Our neighbors and my mama take turns making food at the whole village each day.

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.500
That's sweet.

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:10.500
Aw.

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:14.500
I still tell a little white lie.

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.500
Nah.

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:17.500
I tell the truth.

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:23.500
I'm really actually really bad at telling lies.

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:26.500
It's not my forte.

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:28.500
But I do like trolling.

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:33.500
It's my favorite thing to do.

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:46.500
I'm not really good at lying, but I do like trolling.

01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:50.500
Everyone also takes turns doing chores and watching the little kids.

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:58.500
It sounds like a very nice village.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.500
I don't need to be watched anymore though.

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.500
I'm old enough to help out.

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.500
Yeah, you are. You're a big boy now.

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:08.500
Big boy Nico.

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.500
You're a big boy.

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.500
You are so cute.

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.500
I miss everyone.

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:24.500
Aw.

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:28.500
I've been gone for a while now, haven't I?

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:31.500
I wonder if they're worried about me.

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:36.500
Speaking of helping out, I should probably go now.

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.500
Right.

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:40.500
Do I have to take a nap?

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:44.500
How do you run again?

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.500
Yeah.

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:46.500
Alright.

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:50.500
So where I left off, I was trying to figure out how do you...

01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:55.500
Oh yeah, I need scissors.

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:04.500
Where get scissors?

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:07.500
Wait, this is a bakery, right?

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:09.500
This is like a cafe.

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:18.500
I need scissors to, I think, cut the tape.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:22.500
But where the heck do you get scissors from?

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.500
Okay.

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:45.500
Probably I'm missing something.

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.500
Oh.

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:14.500
Does this person do anything?

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:17.500
Like, do I, like, give her something?

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.500
No, I think I already tried that.

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:34.500
I'm not very good at lying.

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:52.500
Then you're probably going to answer the personality quiz and mystery dungeon, honestly.

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.500
Most likely.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.500
Okay.

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:23.500
Where the heck do you get scissors from?

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.500
Wait a minute.

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:32.500
I think I saw an extra room. Was it an extra room?

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.500
Is this the library?

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:38.500
Yeah, that one was this room, I know.

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:42.500
I saw a hallway or something.

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:44.500
This.

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.500
Oh!

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:49.500
A room I haven't been in!

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:54.500
Scissors.

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:56.500
The pair of scissors on the ground.

01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:58.500
A pile of hair.

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:01.500
I don't think anyone's using this anymore.

01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:13.500
The sink.

01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:17.500
Soap dispenser.

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.500
I found scissors.

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:29.500

01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.500
So, let's find out.

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:43.500
Okay, let's save this one there.

01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:53.500
What if we just fold the magnet under this edge?

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:57.500
And it's holding together just barely.

01:26:57.500 --> 01:26:59.500
How does this go on now?

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:02.500
And what's the tape for?

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:06.500
Save this one there.

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.500
Oh, of course.

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.500
I had to tape it together or it might fall apart.

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.500
Yeah?

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:13.500
I'm thinking, sir.

01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:14.500
I'm smart!

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.500
You know that?

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.500
I'm so smart.

01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:22.500
Look at me.

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.500
I'm so smart.

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.500
Yeah, so now we can go to the surface.

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:43.500
Oh!

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.500
Reactivating elevator services.

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:57.500
Please input security code to continue.

01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:58.500
What?

01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:00.500
What's never happened before?

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:01.500
The squares?

01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:02.500
Huh?

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:03.500
You saw them, right?

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.500
They were on the door and...

01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:06.500
Oh, no.

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:08.500
The scores have happened all the time.

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:12.500
I meant the whole security code thing.

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:15.500
But then again, the elevator hasn't been as broken before.

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:16.500
Hmm.

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:20.500
I guess we should go look for a code, is there a?

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:22.500
Yeah, let's go look for a code.

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:24.500
I broke it.

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.500
Security code to continue.

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:30.500
Oh.

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:33.500
Access denied.

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:35.500
Can I help with anything?

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:36.500
Anyhow.

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.500
Things are unproductive for so long.

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.500
It's really...

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:46.500
Thank you.

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.500
Thank you so much.

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:51.500
I'm going to head out for the five dollar tip.

01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:53.500
Thank you, thank you.

01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:55.500

01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:57.500
Yeah, they're super jealous.

01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:03.500
They want a piece of this bread and they can't have it.

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:04.500
Sorry.

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:07.500
It's really getting to me.

01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.500
I think it's Zora and I got an handle.

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.500
What do you think, Zora?

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:19.500
It's on the standard.

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.500
It's on these random codes.

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:26.500
Maybe you could just try out some numbers until you get it?

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:30.500
Alright, I suppose that's better than doing nothing.

01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:31.500
Let's see.

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:35.500
Yep, gonna be here for a while.

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:41.500
You aren't seriously doing this, are you?

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:52.500
Which way was it to that door?

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:55.500
Oh, it's upright.

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:58.500
I think I have to get it from up here.

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:04.500
Wait, should I go check on plant?

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:05.500
Plant lady?

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.500
Is plant lady okay?

01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:11.500
I have access...

01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:15.500
I have the code from last time, I think, do I?

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:18.500
Do I?

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.500
I do! You're right!

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.500
I do, I do, I do.

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:33.500
Is she okay?

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:35.500
Alright, she's okay.

01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:38.500
Yeah, the film, the film!

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.500
The film!

01:30:40.500 --> 01:31:04.500
It was 6304.

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:06.500
6304.

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:09.500
I'm gonna move myself out of the way a little more.

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:11.500
No?

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.500
Yeah.

01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:45.500
Can't find him.

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:54.500
Hang on one moment.

01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:57.500
Hit.

01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:58.500
Hit.

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:00.500
Oh my goodness.

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.500
6304.

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.500
What?

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.500
Yeah.

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:30.500
What?

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:32.500
It works!

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:35.500
I don't know what you did, but it actually works.

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:37.500
Good job, Kat.

01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:39.500
You're a genius, you know that?

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.500
And I hope for Missouri, too.

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:46.500
I think, I think...

01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.500
Oh, right.

01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:50.500
The whole Messiah business.

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:52.500
Anyway, ready to go?

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:53.500
Bye bye.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:55.500
Wait.

01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.500
Doesn't he do one last thing here?

01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:12.500
Don't be afraid to ask if you're hungry.

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:15.500
I don't get a pancake or a Nikko.

01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:18.500
I thought I got a pancake for a Nikko.

01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:22.500
I think I hear my door.

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:24.500
Hang on, I hear my door.

01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:26.500
Give me one second.

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.500
Give me one second, give me one second.

01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:30.500
Hang on, I hear my door.

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:31.500
Give me one second.

01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:33.500
Give me one second, give me one second.

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:00.500
No, that wasn't my door.

01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:02.500
That was just someone else out there.

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:05.500
I got tricked.

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.500
I was tricked.

01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:15.500
I was tricked.

01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:20.500
I was tricked.

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:22.500
I was tricked.

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:24.500
I was tricked.

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:26.500
I was tricked.

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.500
I was tricked.

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:30.500
I was tricked.

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.500
Oh, hey. Welcome back.

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.500
That shirt took you a while, huh?

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:39.500
Oh shoot, you've been waiting this whole time.

01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:41.500
I wasn't gone that long!

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.500
And holding the door open.

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:47.500
Well, I don't want to be rude.

01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:49.500
I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that, god!

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:51.500
I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that, god!

01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:53.500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:34:57.500 --> 01:34:59.500
Oh no!

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:01.500
I wasn't gone that long.

01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:03.500
I just walked away for a tiny bit.

01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:19.500

01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:28.500

most of the city's stuff. Oh, we used to have a small army of delivery robots doing that, but

01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:42.640
lately a bunch of them have been breaking down. So until they fix them, I'll just have more work on

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:51.600
my plate, and it's left into long. When will the robots get fixed? I have no idea. It's all up to the

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:58.400
scientists over at the labs, but they seem really concerned about something else lately. Oh,

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:08.640
never a good sign when even the smart folks are worried. All right, Zora, should I ask about the city?

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:19.040
The city is very big. It's smaller than it looks. Dang, this whole conversation while we're going

01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:33.840
to the floor. We must be really high up. I knew you here. Welcome in. Nice to see you,

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:37.040
but I'm very sure I've seen you before.

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:53.680
I love to be trapped in an elevator with a Zora with you. I might ravish you.

01:41:53.680 --> 01:42:08.720
Good evening, Muldor. Good evening.

01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:18.160
Getting pretty crowded too. First there was the refugees from the barrens, and now more

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:27.840
women folks are moving into. Oh, it's a safer here, you know? I mean, it's not a haven by any means.

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:34.160
That square stuff that we just saw, we have more of that here than anywhere else apparently,

01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:42.080
I noticed. We're lucky it only seems to affect the city's infrastructures. The land mass

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:50.400
itself is still holding up, which is good since there isn't much solid land here in the first place.

01:42:54.080 --> 01:43:02.880
All right, how's Zora? Should I ask about the library? Can you tell me about the library?

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:09.600
I'm supposed to go there. Oh yeah, that's one of my main delivery spots.

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:14.000
Those reading lights are pretty high maintenance.

01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:21.520
Well, I just feel out of place surrounded by smart people. Well, here's just pretty smart

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:28.720
yourself, so you'll fit in line, you and Zora. I'm dumb. I don't know what he's talking about.

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:38.800
I mean, no, I'm smart. I am so smart. I am intelligent. I am the brightest person ever.

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:41.840
I am intelligent.

01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:57.760
Anyway, it was a nice meeting you.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.200
Right, see you around. Good, good around now.

01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:17.200
I guess we should hurry too. Zora, people are counting on us. Yeah, let's go find that library.

01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:25.680
Amos the robot. Beep boop. Beep boop.

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.600
Suspicious person.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:38.320
Suspicious person, sigh. You all right? Uh, what was I at? Perhaps this is a sigh.

01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:46.080
Tell me, do you think you could fix the world with the sun? Honestly, I don't know.

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:53.120
I've been getting mixed messages. I know. But what do you think? I think.

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:58.400
I think I should listen to Zora. After all, Zora helped me get this far.

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:04.800
That'll take your faith or an answer then. What do you mean by that? It means what

01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:06.800
you think it means.

01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:27.520
Strage man. Strage man.

01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.800
Strage man.

01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:12.800
It's fine. It's fine. I'm really scared.

01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:50.800
Oh, the business gave me so bad a heart. It hurt me so bad. It gave me, oh my god.

01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:12.160
I was so unprepared for that. My chest hurt for a second. It hurt for a split second.

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:14.800
I'm fine.

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:25.920
Zora, did you see what happened? Yeah, my vision went blank for a second.

01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:31.200
And then I saw something, like a really short dream. I don't know what that was about.

01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:37.200
Strage man. Strage man.

01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:44.240
What's up here?

01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.680
Another alleyway?

01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:56.880
Why should I check out over here first?

01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:07.520
It's a faded flyer. It's a faded flyer.

01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:15.200
I'm curious and marking on the ball. Looks like a round.

01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:16.640
He-ee.

01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:20.640
What's down here?

01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:25.840
This is strangely warm in this room.

01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:37.840
Oh, a cat. Are you lost? Me? Do you wish to join us?

01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:46.720
I want to be with the cats. I want this. It's not fair. I want this. This I want. I want.

01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:58.720

01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:11.040
Join your cats? Yes. But I'm not a cat. I don't walk on far likes like they do.

01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:18.960
You have cat eyes? My eyes are normal, people eyes. Well, I'm normal back home.

01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:26.320
You're how to shoot like a cat. But I'm just a person. You're still welcome here.

01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:34.400
I protect lost people as well. Thanks. No, not lost though. You got a sword to guide me. I see.

01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:41.440

01:49:41.440 --> 01:50:07.920

01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:26.960
What's up here? Oh, not going in there. What's up here?

01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:38.640
What's this? The bag has some big plastic disc here. Looks like they're supposed to go in something.

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:45.760
Wait, is there are really going to take these with us? They look so heavy. All right.

01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:55.680
They're actually pretty light. It's a big book. The title says understanding robots.

01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:06.720
An empty glass jar with water handle. A bed. The blanket has quite a few patches.

01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:21.120
I don't know if I can see. There's some broken glass in there. Big coffee cups.

01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:25.520
A lantern plant. Hang on. I need to

01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:33.360

Just now

02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:08.760
I got a rather calm heart, right?

02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:12.160
Come for now

02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:15.160
But my issue with my heart rate is that it goes

02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:19.160
It becomes too slow

02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:22.160
So the numbers are dipping

02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:24.160
Don't be concerned

02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:26.160
It's fine

02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:28.160
I might feel a little faint

02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:29.160
But I just need to relax

02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:30.160
That's all

02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:33.160
Not the only thing you'll probably notice

02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:36.160
Is it dipping

02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:38.160
If it goes any higher

02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:43.160
It's probably because I took my medication

02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:47.160
My medication sometimes makes my heart rate go a little high

02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:06.160
Yeah, the heart rate monitor takes time to go up

02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:08.160
It doesn't go up right away

02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:10.160
So when I got scared it

02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:14.160
It definitely went up to like 70-something

02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:19.160
But it takes time to read the heart

02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:21.160
Promise you'll be okay

02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:24.160
I'm fine, I'll be okay

02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:31.160
They don't taste too bad though

02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:33.160
Do you want one?

02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:35.160
It's okay, thank you

02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:39.160
Hey, hey

02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:42.160
Ready for me to blow your mind?

02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:44.160
Yeah, okay, so

02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:47.160
I've invented a machine, a medicine

02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:50.160
To prepare everyone for the upcoming water shortage

02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:54.160
All you gotta do is dissolve one of these pills in water

02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:56.160
Then you drink the water

02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:59.160
Then you never need to drink water again

02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:00.160
What?

02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:03.160
It also makes plants grow faster

02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:05.160
How does it work?

02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:08.160
Here, why don't you take a free sample?

02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:10.160
Oh, thanks

02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:13.160

02:20:48.160 --> 02:20:55.160
When the world ends, would it be better if it was gone and an instant are slowly fading away?

02:20:55.160 --> 02:20:57.160
An instant.

02:20:57.160 --> 02:21:09.160
If I were to witness the world perishing, I would rather it be spontaneous.

02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:11.160
Boom!

02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:13.160
It's fast.

02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:15.160
Boom!

02:21:15.160 --> 02:21:17.160
It's fun.

02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:19.160
I feel a thing.

02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:21.160
Boom!

02:21:21.160 --> 02:21:29.160
To be honest, I'd rather the former.

02:21:29.160 --> 02:21:37.160
Anything over here?

02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:43.160
But in all honesty, I don't want it to end.

02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:45.160
Or do I?

02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:47.160
No, I don't want it to end.

02:21:47.160 --> 02:21:49.160
I don't want it to end.

02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:53.160
Oh, we're in the library.

02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:55.160
It's a little bridge bridge.

02:21:55.160 --> 02:21:57.160
It's a box by the box.

02:21:57.160 --> 02:21:59.160
Some sort of something.

02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:01.160
I have a person with white hair.

02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:03.160
I like your hair.

02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:05.160
What?

02:22:05.160 --> 02:22:07.160
Well, I didn't say anything.

02:22:07.160 --> 02:22:09.160
Stop staring at me, then.

02:22:09.160 --> 02:22:11.160
I was looking at your book.

02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:13.160
Yes, you're in the library.

02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:17.160
There's books in the library.

02:22:17.160 --> 02:22:21.160
Go bug the chatty one upstairs.

02:22:21.160 --> 02:22:25.160
Others books covered a wide range of topics.

02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:29.160
It seems there are no subjects.

02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:31.160
It is not right.

02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:33.160
Right about.

02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:37.160
Quite the renaissance, man.

02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:39.160
What do you think?

02:22:39.160 --> 02:22:41.160
I hate this brace.

02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:43.160
It makes my wrist so itchy.

02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:45.160
I guess so.

02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:47.160
But he's been focusing on documenting the world.

02:22:47.160 --> 02:22:49.160
As a boy.

02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:51.160
Oh?

02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:53.160

02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:01.160

02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:07.160
Observation?

02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:09.160
Beixion?

02:23:09.160 --> 02:23:11.160
Beison?

02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:13.160
Beison?

02:23:23.160 --> 02:23:25.160
Some of these books

02:23:25.160 --> 02:23:27.160
may be the only thing

02:23:27.160 --> 02:23:29.160
we have to remember

02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:31.160
the rest of the world.

02:23:33.160 --> 02:23:35.160
But our goddess wouldn't let that happen.

02:23:35.160 --> 02:23:37.160
The world ending?

02:23:37.160 --> 02:23:39.160
I'll do my best,

02:23:39.160 --> 02:23:41.160
but I could barely

02:23:41.160 --> 02:23:43.160
I could

02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:45.160
I could barely stop a war.

02:23:49.160 --> 02:23:51.160
I like lost a lot of my

02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:53.160
my powers.

02:23:55.160 --> 02:23:57.160
I'm not as strong as I used to be.

02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:05.160
I'm not as strong as I used to be.

02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:09.160
Sorry, I barely could stop a war.

02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:11.160
I don't think I could stop the world from ending.

02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:21.160
Beison?

02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:23.160

02:24:23.160 --> 02:24:25.160

02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:27.160

02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:33.160
Ah.

02:24:33.160 --> 02:24:35.160
Beis-ti-on?

02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:45.160
I prefer instant death.

02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:47.160
Yes.

02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:49.160
Yes.

02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:51.160
Yes.

02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:53.160
Beis-ti-on?

02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:55.160
Ah.

02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:05.160
Oh, hello. Do you need directions?

02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:07.160
Let's see. This area here

02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:09.160
is mostly historical accounts.

02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:11.160
The reference section

02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:13.160
is downstairs.

02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:15.160
I'm not sure where the children's section is.

02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:17.160
It's okay.

02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:19.160
I'm not really looking for books.

02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:21.160
I'm looking to look for

02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:23.160
the author then.

02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:25.160
Oh, that's good.

02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:27.160
I mean

02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:29.160
that means you won't be disappointed

02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:31.160
when volunteering here

02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:33.160
for months and I've never seen him.

02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:35.160
I haven't once.

02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:37.160
It works together with the head librarian

02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:39.160
on publishing.

02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:41.160
So you'd think he would at least

02:25:41.160 --> 02:25:43.160
show up once in a while.

02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:45.160
But

02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:47.160
he doesn't?

02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:49.160
He seems kind of

02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:51.160
kind of

02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:53.160
reclusive.

02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:57.160
Which is weird

02:25:57.160 --> 02:25:59.160
for a guy who supposedly

02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:01.160
travels for it.

02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:03.160
Maybe it's just around people.

02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:07.160
Let me by.

02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:09.160
Let me in.

02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:11.160
Computer, it's currently all.

02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:15.160
Let's over here.

02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:17.160
Robot.

02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:19.160
Oh, person.

02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:21.160
Hi.

02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:23.160
Reselving in progress.

02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:25.160
Please watch out

02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:27.160
for potential

02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:29.160
following books.

02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:31.160
I will.

02:26:31.160 --> 02:26:33.160
Still scared of ladders.

02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:47.160
Oh.

02:26:55.160 --> 02:26:57.160
You know what I forgot to do today?

02:26:57.160 --> 02:26:59.160
Before stream.

02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:03.160
It was something I forgot to do today.

02:27:07.160 --> 02:27:09.160
I forgot.

02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:11.160
I completely forgot.

02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:13.160
I forgot to say on twitter

02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:15.160
that I was live.

02:27:23.160 --> 02:27:25.160
Oops.

02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:27.160
I react.

02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:39.160
Butter late than ever.

02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:41.160
Yeah, let's do that right now.

02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:45.160
We'll be live for a little while.

02:27:59.160 --> 02:28:01.160
It's almost hibernation time.

02:28:03.160 --> 02:28:05.160
One day I'm going to sleep

02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:07.160
for like 13 hours.

02:28:07.160 --> 02:28:09.160
So.

02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:11.160
Ready for it.

02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:15.160
Oh.

02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:17.160
Ow.

02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:19.160
I hit my head.

02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:21.160
I feel like.

02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:23.160
My horn is hit.

02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:25.160
Hit the microphone.

02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:39.160
I was just trying to stretch.

02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:43.160
I just wanted to stretch.

02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:09.160
Okie är.

02:29:21.160 --> 02:29:23.160

02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:33.160

Nocturnal beetle with a vibrant glow,

02:37:23.460 --> 02:37:28.460
sometimes captured and messed and put in jars

02:37:28.460 --> 02:37:33.460
to be used as living lamps by the Glen's residents.

02:37:33.460 --> 02:37:37.460
This has inspired the now common practice

02:37:37.460 --> 02:37:42.460
of using phosphor shrimps to do the same.

02:37:42.460 --> 02:37:48.460
That made me light-headed.

02:38:13.460 --> 02:38:18.460
I can't help but laugh.

02:38:18.460 --> 02:38:23.460
I can't help but laugh.

02:38:23.460 --> 02:38:28.460
I can't help but laugh.

02:38:28.460 --> 02:38:33.460
I can't help but laugh.

02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:37.460
I can't help but laugh.

02:38:37.460 --> 02:38:41.460
I can't help but laugh.

02:38:41.460 --> 02:38:43.460
OK.

02:38:52.460 --> 02:38:56.460
Undertailed by host of this game so far.

02:38:56.460 --> 02:38:59.460
Somewhat, yeah, I can see it.

02:39:03.460 --> 02:39:05.460
Book reading is smart.

02:39:05.460 --> 02:39:09.460
Using that voice really kind of...

02:39:09.460 --> 02:39:12.460
It's because I can't take breaths in between,

02:39:12.460 --> 02:39:15.460
like proper breaths.

02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:18.460
And my lungs aren't so great.

02:39:21.460 --> 02:39:25.460
So when I read in that voice,

02:39:25.460 --> 02:39:28.460
it's hard to take a breath.

02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:33.460
The author's latest books are really something, yeah?

02:39:34.460 --> 02:39:39.460
Oh, that librarian just released a bunch last week.

02:39:39.460 --> 02:39:42.460
Oh, they're big.

02:39:42.460 --> 02:39:45.460

02:39:45.460 --> 02:39:48.460

As a general rule, if a phosphorous loses its glow entirely, it cannot be re-lit unless exposed to the sun.

02:43:46.580 --> 02:43:56.580
If the phosphor is merely dim, it may be possible to boost it through exposure through another phosphor of higher energy.

02:43:59.580 --> 02:44:06.580
But even so, the boosted phosphor will never return to its original brightness.

02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:22.580
Chapter 5. A survey of phosphors found in the natural world.

02:44:23.580 --> 02:44:29.580
Chapter 6. Blue Phosphor Location

02:44:29.580 --> 02:44:47.580
Blue Phosphor is of moderate levels of energy. It can exist in both organic and mineral forms.

02:44:48.580 --> 02:44:55.580
A mineral form is most commonly found in the metallic sound of the parents.

02:44:56.580 --> 02:45:05.580
The organic form is most commonly found in phosphor strength and in secretions.

02:45:06.580 --> 02:45:20.580
Although the light emission of blue phosphor is powerful, it has what I would describe as self-conserving properties.

02:45:20.580 --> 02:45:35.580
That is to say, the glow may not be constant. Most forms of blue phosphor will stop glowing if left undisturbed for long periods of time.

02:45:35.580 --> 02:45:54.580
If using blue phosphor to perform machines, a motor should be set at a baseline level of activity to ensure constant agitation of the phosphor. Alternatively, live phosphors from can be used.

02:45:55.580 --> 02:46:02.580
Chapter 7. Green Phosphor Location

02:46:02.580 --> 02:46:18.580
Green Phosphor is one of the highest energy. It is almost the rarest of the common phosphor as it can only be found in organic form.

02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:27.580
The known sources include the sap of phosphor trees, fireflies, and various mosses.

02:46:27.580 --> 02:46:52.580
Although this phosphor is present in a... uh oh, what word is that? Apoquitas grounds covering moss in the glen. It is only a minute or months and almost impossible to concentrate.

02:46:52.580 --> 02:47:06.580
Green Phosphor is ideal or industrial use, however, due to its relative scarcity and past over-arvesting.

02:47:06.580 --> 02:47:18.580
And there is currently no reliable source. Thankfully, at least locals of the glen still have enough to get by.

02:47:19.580 --> 02:47:21.580
Ubiquitas.

02:47:22.580 --> 02:47:24.580
Ubiquitas?

02:47:25.580 --> 02:47:28.580
What a strange word. Ubiquitas.

02:47:31.580 --> 02:47:35.580
English is silly. And there it is.

02:47:36.580 --> 02:47:45.580

02:49:21.220 --> 02:49:26.220
I didn't fall asleep now.

02:49:26.220 --> 02:49:28.220
I didn't.

02:49:29.220 --> 02:49:38.220

Out of the common phosphorus, red phosphorus is the lowest energy.

02:50:32.220 --> 02:50:43.220
It exists exclusively in mineral form and can only give light when in solution.

02:50:43.220 --> 02:51:03.220
There's nothing you can do this time.

02:51:03.220 --> 02:51:12.220

There's nothing you can do this time.

02:51:33.220 --> 02:51:46.220
I'll take my meds in 30 minutes.

02:51:46.220 --> 02:51:51.220
If I take it now, pull me to sleep.

02:51:51.220 --> 02:52:00.220
I'm swimming.

02:52:00.220 --> 02:52:05.220
Don't do this to me.

02:52:05.220 --> 02:52:09.220
30 minutes, I promise.

02:52:09.220 --> 02:52:22.220
Believe me.

02:52:22.220 --> 02:52:28.220
I sleep like a pterodactyl.

02:52:29.220 --> 02:52:45.220
I sleep like a pterodactyl.

02:52:45.220 --> 02:53:05.220
I'll take my meds.

02:53:05.220 --> 02:53:14.220
I'll take them.

02:53:15.220 --> 02:53:22.220
I just ripped the scab off my hand.

02:53:22.220 --> 02:53:30.220
The scab from the bike incident.

02:53:30.220 --> 02:53:42.220
I was finally feeling.

02:53:42.220 --> 02:53:53.220
Don't come, baby.

02:53:53.220 --> 02:54:01.220
I make that noise when I fly to scare people sometimes.

02:54:01.220 --> 02:54:12.220
Maybe fly around.

02:54:12.220 --> 02:54:16.220
And also grow massive and still fly around.

02:54:16.220 --> 02:54:26.220
Just a giant figure in the sky.

02:54:31.220 --> 02:54:47.220
Just get really big.

02:54:47.220 --> 02:55:16.220
Oh, no.

02:55:17.220 --> 02:55:37.220
Oh, no.

02:55:38.220 --> 02:55:45.220
It's just closed out.

02:55:45.220 --> 02:55:54.220
Where did I stop reading?

02:55:54.220 --> 02:56:01.220
This can create an artificial light energy stage with great luminosity.

02:56:01.220 --> 02:56:17.220
The major caveat is that the phosphor is the super saturated solution will precipitate out rather quickly.

02:56:17.220 --> 02:56:28.220
As soon as the phosphor recrystallizes, it loses its glow permanently.

02:56:28.220 --> 02:56:48.220
If using super saturated red phosphor as a power source, make sure there are proper facilities or services that can replace it frequently.

02:56:49.220 --> 02:56:55.220
I yield the author is so cool.

02:56:55.220 --> 02:57:02.220
I already can travel over the world with a flying machine as I gather materials for his books.

02:57:02.220 --> 02:57:04.220
Wow.

02:57:04.220 --> 02:57:09.220
You know, I've tried looking for the flying machine with my binoculars for ages.

02:57:09.220 --> 02:57:15.220
I was so such a thing, though.

02:57:16.220 --> 02:57:20.220
What are you doing to that book?

02:57:20.220 --> 02:57:24.220
Don't worry. These are my own books that I wrote.

02:57:24.220 --> 02:57:28.220
I just pulled them off the shelves to modify them.

02:57:28.220 --> 02:57:31.220
I have to cross out some sections.

02:57:31.220 --> 02:57:33.220
Most sections.

02:57:33.220 --> 02:57:35.220
I don't know how come.

02:57:35.220 --> 02:57:38.220
Because otherwise they'll think I copied him.

02:57:38.220 --> 02:57:41.220
Him the other.

02:57:41.220 --> 02:57:45.220
Man, I really don't see the point of writing anything anymore.

02:57:45.220 --> 02:57:49.220
The author is just gonna write about the same thing.

02:57:49.220 --> 02:57:51.220
Then everyone will love it.

02:57:51.220 --> 02:57:55.220
I know he's gonna remember the books that I came out before it is.

02:57:55.220 --> 02:57:57.220
Oh, man.

02:57:57.220 --> 02:57:59.220
I ain't hatin'.

02:57:59.220 --> 02:58:01.220
I ain't hatin'.

02:58:01.220 --> 02:58:05.220
I ain't hatin'.

02:58:05.220 --> 02:58:08.220
I ain't hatin'.

02:58:08.220 --> 02:58:11.220
I can see why people go nuts with this stuff.

02:58:11.220 --> 02:58:14.220
That guy's got major talent.

02:58:14.220 --> 02:58:18.220
This just hurts, you know?

02:58:18.220 --> 02:58:20.220
I've had that before.

02:58:20.220 --> 02:58:24.220
I used to draw stuff.

02:58:24.220 --> 02:58:30.220
And I would draw like poses and stuff.

02:58:30.220 --> 02:58:33.220
People would be like, you're just using that pose.

02:58:33.220 --> 02:58:35.220
Someone else used that pose.

02:58:35.220 --> 02:58:38.220
I'm just using this pose.

02:58:38.220 --> 02:58:41.220
Oh.

02:58:41.220 --> 02:58:44.220
Oh.

02:58:44.220 --> 02:58:53.220
It's not a problem if people call you a copycat for something you wrote about first.

02:58:53.220 --> 02:58:55.220
I can see that.

02:58:55.220 --> 02:59:00.220
People call me a cat all the time.

02:59:00.220 --> 02:59:02.220
Have me go.

02:59:02.220 --> 02:59:04.220
Why is he so cute?

02:59:04.220 --> 02:59:06.220
I don't know.

02:59:06.220 --> 02:59:10.220
I don't want to be this cute.

02:59:15.220 --> 02:59:18.220
It's a crime.

02:59:18.220 --> 02:59:24.220
Even though I'm a person and cats are pets and mousebers.

02:59:24.220 --> 02:59:31.220
I sure, I sure, I sure hope people don't think I eat mice.

02:59:31.220 --> 02:59:35.220
I guess we're in the same boat, kiddo.

02:59:35.220 --> 02:59:39.220
I think I changed at least half of books worth of content.

02:59:39.220 --> 02:59:42.220
Even then, it's still too similar.

02:59:42.220 --> 02:59:44.220
Looks like I'll just have to accept my fate.

02:59:44.220 --> 02:59:48.220
But I guess being called a cat isn't all that bad.

02:59:48.220 --> 02:59:52.220
As long as people don't assume you eat mice.

02:59:54.220 --> 02:59:56.220
I'm done.

02:59:56.220 --> 02:59:59.220
I'm done.

02:59:59.220 --> 03:00:01.220
Excuse me.

03:00:01.220 --> 03:00:04.220
Oh, you are the messiah.

03:00:04.220 --> 03:00:06.220
Welcome.

03:00:06.220 --> 03:00:09.220
I have to take this bracelet off the sternart.

03:00:09.220 --> 03:00:11.220
Annoy me.

03:00:11.220 --> 03:00:13.220
Get off me, get off me!

03:00:13.220 --> 03:00:16.220
We're good.

03:00:16.220 --> 03:00:19.220
We're fine.

03:00:19.220 --> 03:00:21.220
I'm sorry.

She is here. She is in the archival room upstairs.

03:02:16.520 --> 03:02:24.520
When she is concentrating on her work, she will ignore any and all phone call for several days.

03:02:24.520 --> 03:02:30.520
Nice. Can you go get her in person then? Leaving this post is not in my programming.

03:02:30.520 --> 03:02:36.520
And can I go myself? Of course. The archival room is accessible through the stairway behind me.

03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:38.520
Gosh, I think.

03:02:43.520 --> 03:02:45.520
Hello, very interesting archival room.

03:02:48.520 --> 03:02:51.520
Coffee. Coffee is for grown-ups.

03:02:52.520 --> 03:02:54.520
You know, Miko, you said you were a grown-up.

03:02:55.520 --> 03:02:59.520
On authorised entry. Library card required for further access. Wait, what?

03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:02.520
Library card required for further access.

03:03:02.520 --> 03:03:04.520
No library card though. We're gonna get one.

03:03:04.520 --> 03:03:07.520
This is a question for the headlamp.

03:03:17.520 --> 03:03:18.520
Tell me to call her.

03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:31.520
Are you heading to bed? Good night.

03:03:32.520 --> 03:03:33.520
Have a good night.

03:03:34.520 --> 03:03:35.520
Good night.

03:03:40.520 --> 03:03:43.520
Thank you for stopping by the day's stream.

03:03:54.520 --> 03:03:55.520
She is not picking up.

03:03:56.520 --> 03:03:57.520
I figured.

03:03:58.520 --> 03:04:00.520
Are you sure you can't just let me through?

03:04:00.520 --> 03:04:03.520
Letting you through with that library card is against my programming.

03:04:03.520 --> 03:04:04.520
What?

03:04:05.520 --> 03:04:08.520
Even in an emergency, my program is not flexible.

03:04:09.520 --> 03:04:10.520
I have not been tamed.

03:04:18.520 --> 03:04:19.520
What if I just run?

03:04:21.520 --> 03:04:23.520
What if I just run in with stopping me?

03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:26.520
What's he gonna do, blow me up?

03:04:27.520 --> 03:04:31.520
I thought the rules was not to hurt humans or any living creature.

03:04:33.520 --> 03:04:35.520
I'm on my third cup of coffee.

03:04:36.520 --> 03:04:38.520
I can't feel my limbs and stop drinking.

03:04:39.520 --> 03:04:42.520
When I have to stay awake, I need to find out how this book ends.

03:04:42.520 --> 03:04:44.520
You can read it the next day.

03:04:45.520 --> 03:04:47.520
Wait, but the world is kind of ending.

03:04:49.520 --> 03:04:51.520
Wanting to finish your book before it does.

03:04:52.520 --> 03:04:53.520
Relatable.

03:04:53.520 --> 03:04:54.520
Relatable?

03:04:55.520 --> 03:04:57.520
Because the author and his beautiful clipping hurts.

03:05:00.520 --> 03:05:02.520
I got a library card.

03:05:08.520 --> 03:05:10.520
A library card.

03:05:15.520 --> 03:05:16.520
He just played at me.

03:05:17.520 --> 03:05:18.520
I don't think we should bother him.

03:05:19.520 --> 03:05:20.520
What a jerk.

03:05:21.520 --> 03:05:23.520
What a stinky poo poo head.

03:05:24.520 --> 03:05:25.520
What a stinker.

03:05:26.520 --> 03:05:27.520
Smells like kaka.

03:05:32.520 --> 03:05:33.520
Street up.

03:05:34.520 --> 03:05:35.520
Poopoo.

03:05:36.520 --> 03:05:37.520
Love person.

03:05:37.520 --> 03:05:38.520
Libraries up ahead, thanks.

03:05:43.520 --> 03:05:46.520
Okay, that promises the least pain on your grave.

03:05:46.520 --> 03:05:47.520
I do.

03:05:50.520 --> 03:05:51.520
Um...

03:06:04.520 --> 03:06:06.520
Oh, excuse me.

03:06:08.520 --> 03:06:11.520
Wait, did I come from that way?

03:06:21.520 --> 03:06:24.520
It's an elevator.

03:06:26.520 --> 03:06:28.520
We have been here before.

03:06:40.520 --> 03:06:42.520
Fish tank. It's a big fish tank.

03:06:42.520 --> 03:06:43.520
Oh, hey there.

03:06:44.520 --> 03:06:45.520
You have a lot of fish.

03:06:45.520 --> 03:06:47.520
Yeah, I'm worried about them.

03:06:47.520 --> 03:06:48.520
Huh?

03:06:48.520 --> 03:06:54.520
Or something about how the square particle stuff just took out a major pipeline.

03:06:54.520 --> 03:06:58.520
I guess I should take advantage of the running water while I still can.

03:07:01.520 --> 03:07:02.520
The sink.

03:07:04.520 --> 03:07:05.520
Big fish.

03:07:05.520 --> 03:07:06.520
Nope.

03:07:06.520 --> 03:07:08.520
Not looking for it's that water shortage.

03:07:12.520 --> 03:07:14.520
Is there anything I can do in here?

03:07:35.520 --> 03:07:36.520
Does he want this?

03:07:38.520 --> 03:07:39.520
No?

03:07:39.520 --> 03:07:40.520
No.

03:07:45.520 --> 03:07:46.520
Anything else?

03:07:46.520 --> 03:07:48.520
Anything else?

03:07:48.520 --> 03:07:50.520
Are you here to purchase a copy?

03:07:50.520 --> 03:07:51.520
No?

03:07:51.520 --> 03:07:52.520
Favorite for grown-ups?

03:07:52.520 --> 03:07:53.520
Grown-ups?

03:07:53.520 --> 03:07:54.520
Yeah.

03:07:54.520 --> 03:07:55.520
What does that mean?

03:07:55.520 --> 03:07:56.520
I don't know.

03:07:56.520 --> 03:07:57.520

03:08:05.520 --> 03:08:06.520
What does that mean?

03:08:06.520 --> 03:08:07.520
It means people who aren't kids.

03:08:07.520 --> 03:08:08.520
Kids?

03:08:08.520 --> 03:08:10.520

03:08:10.520 --> 03:08:11.520

03:23:50.800 --> 03:23:58.800
It suddenly appeared. It was missing for like a whole two weeks. Now it's right in front of me.

03:24:01.800 --> 03:24:04.800
I can't find it. I have it.

03:24:07.800 --> 03:24:09.800
Oh shh.

03:24:14.800 --> 03:24:16.800
I did not feel good.

03:24:20.800 --> 03:24:23.800
Burned.

03:24:51.800 --> 03:24:53.800
Alright.

03:24:54.800 --> 03:25:01.800
All my vets have been taken. I even put my cream on. I did all of that.

03:25:11.800 --> 03:25:13.800
And I'm gonna light this candle.

03:25:21.800 --> 03:25:23.800
Can you help me?

03:25:24.800 --> 03:25:26.800
Here you go.

03:25:27.800 --> 03:25:29.800
Oh, that was hot.

03:25:29.800 --> 03:25:31.800
I'm working here.

03:25:57.800 --> 03:25:59.800
How about my schedule?

03:26:17.800 --> 03:26:20.800
That was a thought that was in my head and I said it all out.

03:26:21.800 --> 03:26:28.800
I wonder what the author would do in this situation.

03:26:28.800 --> 03:26:32.800
I thought this little blank usually references his work.

03:26:37.800 --> 03:26:39.800
There's work here.

03:26:40.800 --> 03:26:45.800
The barrens in there just reported another sighting of the particles.

03:26:45.800 --> 03:26:51.800
The particles are commonly not here unusual at this point.

03:26:54.800 --> 03:26:57.800
Those squares particles just took it out.

03:26:57.800 --> 03:26:59.800
I don't know about that one.

03:27:00.800 --> 03:27:03.800
I might have to put on water and it was...

03:27:03.800 --> 03:27:05.800
...adaptable.

03:27:07.800 --> 03:27:09.800
Alright.

03:27:15.800 --> 03:27:19.800
And we have some more disruptions.

03:27:19.800 --> 03:27:23.800
And Sector 8 of the city.

03:27:24.800 --> 03:27:30.800
This is consistent with our earlier findings. Not good at all.

03:27:39.800 --> 03:27:42.800
I can barely keep my eyes open.

03:27:42.800 --> 03:27:44.800
Help me too.

03:27:44.800 --> 03:27:50.800
How does a doctor's silver blank get that all out energy?

03:27:53.800 --> 03:27:57.800
These are of a thermal functioning at a frightening rate.

03:27:57.800 --> 03:28:04.800
The school damage from square particle anomalies is almost impossible to reverse.

03:28:04.800 --> 03:28:08.800
Not a living person can touch them unless they have a death wish.

03:28:08.800 --> 03:28:13.800
But if we're lucky, sometimes the squares go away on their own.

03:28:13.800 --> 03:28:20.800
But not before taking away one of the robot's arms or legs or head.

03:28:21.800 --> 03:28:23.800
Okay.

03:28:25.800 --> 03:28:27.800
I cannot stop spinning.

03:28:28.800 --> 03:28:30.800
Robot.

03:28:31.800 --> 03:28:33.800
You're waiting to be repaired.

03:28:34.800 --> 03:28:36.800
You're waiting to be repaired.

03:28:37.800 --> 03:28:39.800
This one is an active.

03:28:40.800 --> 03:28:43.800
This is so tedious.

03:28:43.800 --> 03:28:50.800
I miss the good old days before our robot repairing robots broke down.

03:28:50.800 --> 03:28:54.800
All robots have to be assembled by actual people.

03:28:54.800 --> 03:28:57.800
But aren't you a robot?

03:28:57.800 --> 03:28:59.800
No?

03:28:59.800 --> 03:29:01.800
Do I sound like a robot to you?

03:29:01.800 --> 03:29:02.800
Or really?

03:29:02.800 --> 03:29:04.800
Your head is a TV.

03:29:04.800 --> 03:29:07.800
What does that have to do with anything?

03:29:07.800 --> 03:29:09.800
Nevermind.

03:29:10.800 --> 03:29:12.800
Robot.

03:29:19.800 --> 03:29:22.800
A lot of us have been sleeping.

03:29:22.800 --> 03:29:27.800
Sleeping very well in light of recent events.

03:29:27.800 --> 03:29:31.800
And the square particle stuck out a few of my robots, I think.

03:29:32.800 --> 03:29:34.800
She's still asleep.

03:29:35.800 --> 03:29:37.800
She's still asleep.

03:29:43.800 --> 03:29:44.800
That's me.

03:29:44.800 --> 03:29:48.800
Ah, so I thought I'd sleep some time.

03:29:49.800 --> 03:29:51.800
Hello?

03:29:52.800 --> 03:29:54.800
Oh, shoot.

03:29:54.800 --> 03:29:56.800
But I know you would be here so soon.

03:29:56.800 --> 03:29:59.800
I would've turned off the darn wall.

03:30:00.800 --> 03:30:02.800
Hello there.

03:30:02.800 --> 03:30:04.800
What about the weird security measures?

03:30:04.800 --> 03:30:05.800
Oh, yeah.

03:30:05.800 --> 03:30:07.800
They're holding something.

03:30:07.800 --> 03:30:08.800
I don't know.

03:30:08.800 --> 03:30:10.800
Can I help you with anything?

03:30:10.800 --> 03:30:11.800
Yeah.

03:30:11.800 --> 03:30:13.800
Do you know how you get a library card?

03:30:13.800 --> 03:30:14.800
A library card?

03:30:14.800 --> 03:30:17.800
No, there's a library for that to try.

03:30:17.800 --> 03:30:20.800
I need it to see the library.

03:30:20.800 --> 03:30:22.800
But I can't get through the library card.

03:30:22.800 --> 03:30:25.800
But at the same time, she's the one who gives out library cards.

03:30:25.800 --> 03:30:26.800
Really.

03:30:27.800 --> 03:30:28.800
Yeah.

03:30:29.800 --> 03:30:31.800
I'm just going.

03:30:32.800 --> 03:30:34.800
Please get some Eve for me.

03:30:34.800 --> 03:30:36.800
Okay, I'm okay.

03:30:40.800 --> 03:30:42.800
I'll go to sleep soon, alright?

03:30:42.800 --> 03:30:43.800
I'm fine.

03:30:44.800 --> 03:30:47.800
We're almost done with the game, I think, right?

03:30:47.800 --> 03:30:50.800
How much longer do you think we have?

03:30:51.800 --> 03:30:54.800
How much more do we have?

03:30:55.800 --> 03:30:57.800
I want to keep going.

03:30:57.800 --> 03:30:59.800
If we're so close, let's finish it.

03:30:59.800 --> 03:31:01.800
We could finish it.

03:31:03.800 --> 03:31:05.800
It will finish this.

03:31:05.800 --> 03:31:06.800
I'm fine.

03:31:08.800 --> 03:31:10.800
That sounds like JoJo already.

03:31:10.800 --> 03:31:13.800
I'm sorry you can't hear all that fuzzy.

03:31:14.800 --> 03:31:15.800
Wait, I don't know.

03:31:15.800 --> 03:31:17.800
I need to see the library card.

03:31:17.800 --> 03:31:19.800
It won't be hard for me to get on.

03:31:19.800 --> 03:31:20.800
Okay.

03:31:21.800 --> 03:31:22.800
There.

03:31:22.800 --> 03:31:24.800
You're also, I think.

03:31:24.800 --> 03:31:25.800
Wait.

03:31:25.800 --> 03:31:26.800
Shoot.

03:31:26.800 --> 03:31:27.800
I forgot.

03:31:27.800 --> 03:31:30.800
If I'm just a library bot.

03:31:30.800 --> 03:31:32.800
I have a face recognition function.

03:31:32.800 --> 03:31:33.800
My photo.

03:31:33.800 --> 03:31:35.800
The card won't match you.

03:31:36.800 --> 03:31:38.800
How much do I have to have a photo?

03:31:38.800 --> 03:31:39.800
Keep a photo.

03:31:40.800 --> 03:31:42.800
My face to your face.

03:31:42.800 --> 03:31:44.800
That was a joke.

03:31:45.800 --> 03:31:48.800
No, no, maybe you'll get lucky enough about the video.

03:31:49.800 --> 03:31:51.800
First comes first.

03:31:51.800 --> 03:31:54.800
I always find stories in the photo.

03:31:55.800 --> 03:31:56.800
What's this?

03:31:56.800 --> 03:31:58.800
I'm always looking out for stuff.

03:31:58.800 --> 03:31:59.800
The shit with glittering glue.

03:31:59.800 --> 03:32:01.800
You know how that feels.

03:32:01.800 --> 03:32:03.800
I don't know any glitter.

03:32:03.800 --> 03:32:04.800
You sure?

03:32:04.800 --> 03:32:05.800
Yeah.

03:32:05.800 --> 03:32:07.800
How much on do those?

03:32:07.800 --> 03:32:09.800
I'll throw us during your hair.

03:32:09.800 --> 03:32:11.800
I know I do a little bit.

03:32:15.800 --> 03:32:18.800
I've been walking all over the world.

03:32:18.800 --> 03:32:19.800
Yeah.

03:32:19.800 --> 03:32:20.800
Imagine.

03:32:21.800 --> 03:32:23.800
Do you get really tired sometimes?

03:32:23.800 --> 03:32:24.800
Yeah.

03:32:24.800 --> 03:32:25.800
Yeah.

03:32:26.800 --> 03:32:27.800
Yeah, kind of.

03:32:27.800 --> 03:32:28.800
Yeah.

03:32:29.800 --> 03:32:30.800
Yeah.

03:32:31.800 --> 03:32:32.800
But I don't mind.

03:32:32.800 --> 03:32:34.800
It's actually really pretty.

03:32:34.800 --> 03:32:36.800
Yeah, this game is really great.

03:32:38.800 --> 03:32:40.800
I'm glad that you think so.

03:32:41.800 --> 03:32:43.800
Even when the sun's gone.

03:32:43.800 --> 03:32:45.800
But it's still a beautiful place.

03:32:46.800 --> 03:32:49.800
What does the world look like with the sun?

03:32:49.800 --> 03:32:50.800
Oh.

03:32:50.800 --> 03:32:51.800
Uh.

03:32:51.800 --> 03:32:52.800
You know.

03:32:52.800 --> 03:32:54.800
Some of the birds that I've met.

03:32:54.800 --> 03:32:56.800
A little of us have actually seen it.

03:32:56.800 --> 03:32:57.800
Oh.

03:32:57.800 --> 03:32:59.800
Ironic, isn't it?

03:32:59.800 --> 03:33:02.800
It was on the world's leading researcher.

03:33:02.800 --> 03:33:05.800
While I just stay here and build robots.

03:33:06.800 --> 03:33:08.800
They're the ones exploring the world.

03:33:08.800 --> 03:33:10.800
I just write down the data.

03:33:10.800 --> 03:33:11.800
Crunch numbers.

03:33:11.800 --> 03:33:12.800
Generate graphs.

03:33:12.800 --> 03:33:13.800
Right.

03:33:14.800 --> 03:33:16.800
I've been seeing robots everywhere.

03:33:16.800 --> 03:33:20.800
I thought it was because the world was too dangerous for most people to explore.

03:33:20.800 --> 03:33:23.800
That's not far from the truth, actually.

03:33:23.800 --> 03:33:25.800
But I know someone.

03:33:25.800 --> 03:33:27.800
Still does this research for a second.

03:33:27.800 --> 03:33:28.800
Oh.

03:33:29.800 --> 03:33:32.800
Even after segments.

03:33:32.800 --> 03:33:35.800
The land started collapsing and access.

03:33:35.800 --> 03:33:37.800
But the more remote.

03:33:38.800 --> 03:33:39.800
Uh.

03:33:39.800 --> 03:33:40.800
There's a stretch.

03:33:40.800 --> 03:33:41.800
You got it.

03:33:41.800 --> 03:33:42.800
Here it is.

03:33:42.800 --> 03:33:44.800
It became difficult.

03:34:06.800 --> 03:34:08.800
We can finish an hour.

03:34:08.800 --> 03:34:09.800
That's fine.

03:34:09.800 --> 03:34:11.800
Let's finish this.

03:34:12.800 --> 03:34:14.800
Because tomorrow we play stray.

03:34:14.800 --> 03:34:16.800
And we get to be a cat.

03:34:18.800 --> 03:34:20.800
Cat games.

03:34:20.800 --> 03:34:22.800
The best kind of games.

03:34:27.800 --> 03:34:29.800
Our game is calling you out.

03:34:29.800 --> 03:34:30.800
It's true.

03:34:30.800 --> 03:34:31.800
Drink water.

03:34:31.800 --> 03:34:33.800
I've been drinking soda.

03:34:33.800 --> 03:34:35.800
I haven't been drinking water.

03:34:36.800 --> 03:34:39.800
I drunk all you an entire thing of orange juice today.

03:34:42.800 --> 03:34:43.800
Oh.

03:34:52.800 --> 03:34:54.800
Tomorrow's collab.

03:34:54.800 --> 03:34:55.800

03:34:55.800 --> 03:34:56.800
Okay.

03:34:57.800 --> 03:34:58.800

03:34:58.800 --> 03:34:59.800

03:34:59.800 --> 03:35:01.800
Tomorrow we have a group collab with the adults.

03:35:03.800 --> 03:35:05.800
There are some of the adults girls.

03:35:12.800 --> 03:35:13.800
Yeah.

03:35:25.800 --> 03:35:26.800
I'll watch them.

03:35:26.800 --> 03:35:27.800
I'm 40.

03:35:27.800 --> 03:35:29.800
Turn it over with the voices.

03:35:30.800 --> 03:35:32.800
You don't have all of our streams of them.

03:35:34.800 --> 03:35:36.800
Fun.

03:35:36.800 --> 03:35:37.800

Is this like this?

03:50:53.660 --> 03:50:55.660

03:51:19.660 --> 03:51:22.660
The bodily ones go at the end.

03:51:22.660 --> 03:51:24.660
This is not bodily.

03:51:24.660 --> 03:51:27.660

03:51:33.660 --> 03:51:35.660
So, if we...

03:51:35.660 --> 03:51:37.660
What do we put over here?

03:51:37.660 --> 03:51:39.660
And then put this...

03:51:40.660 --> 03:51:42.660
Right here.

03:51:42.660 --> 03:51:44.660

03:51:44.660 --> 03:51:46.660

03:51:46.660 --> 03:51:48.660

03:51:48.660 --> 03:51:50.660

03:51:53.660 --> 03:51:55.660

04:00:32.100 --> 04:00:34.100
Wow

04:00:51.100 --> 04:00:58.100
In my experience, the kind of knowledge is usually recorded in some cryptic book.

04:00:58.100 --> 04:01:04.100
But I haven't read anything like that before. Sorry.

04:01:04.100 --> 04:01:10.100
I have a cryptic book.

04:01:10.100 --> 04:01:16.100
These books are full of cool speakers.

04:01:16.100 --> 04:01:22.100
Those are my manuscripts that others sent me as a head librarian.

04:01:22.100 --> 04:01:28.100
It's my job to help them with the publication process.

04:01:28.100 --> 04:01:34.100
But it really hasn't been sending me anything.

04:01:34.100 --> 04:01:38.100
This is an icon.

04:01:38.100 --> 04:01:44.100
I guess it does give me some extra time to work through this backlog.

04:01:44.100 --> 04:01:48.100
To be honest, I'm a little behind.

04:01:48.100 --> 04:01:52.100
Here is another one.

04:01:52.100 --> 04:01:56.100
This is an crossing book.

04:01:56.100 --> 04:02:02.100

9, 10, 45, 23, Thursday.

04:05:58.060 --> 04:06:01.060
Very sketchy practice.

04:06:05.060 --> 04:06:07.060
What the fuck happened?

04:06:07.060 --> 04:06:09.060
Hey, I need this book.

04:06:09.060 --> 04:06:11.060
It's actually a book lover.

04:06:12.060 --> 04:06:15.060
Although this documentation

04:06:15.060 --> 04:06:18.060
is primarily backed with black,

04:06:18.060 --> 04:06:21.060
the leaves display incredible resistance

04:06:21.060 --> 04:06:24.060
and exposes just in light.

04:06:24.060 --> 04:06:28.060
These curious lands are more resilient, resilient,

04:06:28.060 --> 04:06:32.060
and can even thrive in the metallic sand

04:06:32.060 --> 04:06:35.060
and harsh climate of the land.

04:06:36.060 --> 04:06:38.060
In the Glen,

04:06:38.060 --> 04:06:41.060
you can also grow dark on top of the moss layer

04:06:41.060 --> 04:06:44.060
without competing with the moss for resources.

04:06:45.060 --> 04:06:49.060
Radiocarbon-dating fossils suggest

04:06:49.060 --> 04:06:51.060
that these plants

04:06:51.060 --> 04:06:54.060
would be the first lifeforms of the Glen Lake Outer World.

04:06:56.060 --> 04:06:58.060
Cool.

04:07:08.060 --> 04:07:11.060
A book is working out, isn't it?

04:07:12.060 --> 04:07:14.060
Oh.

04:07:16.060 --> 04:07:19.060
Thankfully, Dr. Silver points to you

04:07:19.060 --> 04:07:22.060
with able to replicate our prototype.

04:07:24.060 --> 04:07:27.060
On the right is an update sketch

04:07:27.060 --> 04:07:29.060
of some modifications

04:07:29.060 --> 04:07:31.060
of the external design.

04:07:31.060 --> 04:07:33.060
More importantly,

04:07:33.060 --> 04:07:35.060
we used a radical,

04:07:35.060 --> 04:07:40.060
we used a radically different architecture

04:07:40.060 --> 04:07:42.060
rather than micro-processors.

04:07:42.060 --> 04:07:45.060
Due to the limited resources this time,

04:07:45.060 --> 04:07:49.060
it still should be able to deliver

04:07:49.060 --> 04:07:53.060
a label delivering the Lake Broadmasters' message.

04:07:53.060 --> 04:07:57.060
The teams suggested that taming will last cause.

04:08:11.060 --> 04:08:14.060
It's a bun.

04:08:16.060 --> 04:08:19.060
It's a stack of paper.

04:08:19.060 --> 04:08:21.060
My new script.

04:08:22.060 --> 04:08:24.060
A full background.

04:08:25.060 --> 04:08:28.060
But she did believe in the multiverse theory

04:08:28.060 --> 04:08:31.060
regarding alternate verses.

04:08:31.060 --> 04:08:34.060
She liked the probability

04:08:34.060 --> 04:08:36.060
of the rolling of dice.

04:08:37.060 --> 04:08:39.060
Searchingly,

04:08:39.060 --> 04:08:42.060
I found that very easier and easier to believe,

04:08:42.060 --> 04:08:45.060
but I could not describe it very well back then.

04:08:45.060 --> 04:08:47.060
Nevertheless,

04:08:47.060 --> 04:08:50.060
I still wrote it to the best of my abilities.

04:08:50.060 --> 04:08:53.060
After all, it felt only right to honor

04:08:53.060 --> 04:08:55.060
how hard this way.

04:08:55.060 --> 04:08:57.060
There are six.

04:08:57.060 --> 04:09:00.060
Which one did you encounter?

04:09:00.060 --> 04:09:02.060
Four.

04:09:02.060 --> 04:09:04.060
I've encountered four.

04:09:07.060 --> 04:09:10.060
So that I won't sleep again.

04:09:14.060 --> 04:09:17.060
The bridge is full of bottled water

04:09:17.060 --> 04:09:20.060
and take-out boxes.

04:09:21.060 --> 04:09:23.060
Work, work, work.

04:09:23.060 --> 04:09:25.060
Work, work.

04:09:25.060 --> 04:09:27.060
Click the scanner

04:09:27.060 --> 04:09:29.060
and the printer.

04:09:29.060 --> 04:09:31.060
I'm pretty sure you said something about

04:09:31.060 --> 04:09:34.060
unupdated databases.

04:09:34.060 --> 04:09:36.060
Unupdated databases.

04:09:36.060 --> 04:09:38.060
Oh, man.

04:09:38.060 --> 04:09:40.060
I see those here.

04:09:49.060 --> 04:09:51.060
Work, work, work.

04:09:51.060 --> 04:09:53.060
Work, work, work.

04:09:53.060 --> 04:09:55.060
I keep a cover of everything that I published

04:09:55.060 --> 04:09:57.060
for him in the archival room.

04:09:57.060 --> 04:09:59.060
He didn't read some of it.

04:10:00.060 --> 04:10:02.060
He didn't read some.

04:10:02.060 --> 04:10:04.060
There are even illustrations.

04:10:04.060 --> 04:10:06.060
Kids like pictures.

04:10:06.060 --> 04:10:08.060
Right?

04:10:12.060 --> 04:10:14.060
It's like a box back there.

04:10:16.060 --> 04:10:18.060
And the painting is a box.

04:10:32.060 --> 04:10:34.060
Hi, travel good night.

04:10:34.060 --> 04:10:36.060
Thank you for stopping by today's stream.

04:10:36.060 --> 04:10:38.060
I appreciate that.

04:10:38.060 --> 04:10:40.060
Appreciate you.

04:10:51.060 --> 04:10:53.060
Maybe...

04:10:56.060 --> 04:10:59.060
Are you guys really trying to give me that?

04:11:00.060 --> 04:11:02.060
To lengthen this?

04:11:04.060 --> 04:11:07.060
I thought this game was going to be super short.

04:11:07.060 --> 04:11:09.060
Like, not short.

04:11:09.060 --> 04:11:11.060
I thought I could finish this game much faster.

04:11:11.060 --> 04:11:13.060
But I get so distracted.

04:11:13.060 --> 04:11:17.060
And then I don't even finish anything.

04:11:20.060 --> 04:11:22.060
I'm ready yet.

04:11:22.060 --> 04:11:24.060
Do you have any questions about books?

04:11:24.060 --> 04:11:26.060
I can answer them.

04:11:26.060 --> 04:11:28.060
I love books.

04:11:30.060 --> 04:11:32.060
Haha.

04:11:33.060 --> 04:11:35.060
It's about four to five hours to refresh it.

04:11:35.060 --> 04:11:37.060
I thought I could.

04:11:37.060 --> 04:11:39.060
I thought I could do that.

04:11:39.060 --> 04:11:41.060
But I'm so slow.

04:11:47.060 --> 04:11:49.060
I'm so slow.

04:11:54.060 --> 04:11:56.060
Yeah.

04:12:00.060 --> 04:12:02.060
Yes, I was only at the rest.

04:12:05.060 --> 04:12:08.060
Can I share this strange journal?

04:12:08.060 --> 04:12:10.060
Do you like this?

04:12:10.060 --> 04:12:12.060
Oh, I did have this.

04:12:12.060 --> 04:12:14.060
I think it's written in some kind of...

04:12:14.060 --> 04:12:16.060
Swiss.

04:12:16.060 --> 04:12:18.060
I moved my microphone something.

04:12:20.060 --> 04:12:22.060
I'm leaning back.

04:12:22.060 --> 04:12:24.060
Wrapped in a blanket right now.

04:12:25.060 --> 04:12:27.060
Haha.

04:12:27.060 --> 04:12:30.060
It was so cozy.

04:12:30.060 --> 04:12:32.060
I was so cozy and comfy.

04:12:33.060 --> 04:12:35.060
Haha.

04:12:53.060 --> 04:12:55.060
I'm fine. I'm fine, thank you.

04:12:58.060 --> 04:13:00.060
Damn mosquito.

04:13:02.060 --> 04:13:04.060
I'm going to squish it when I get the chance.

04:13:07.060 --> 04:13:10.060
He'll rule the day that he fucked with me.

04:13:15.060 --> 04:13:17.060
I'll absolutely obliterate him.

04:13:23.060 --> 04:13:25.060
I'll clap him with these shakes.

04:13:25.060 --> 04:13:27.060
Haha.

04:13:31.060 --> 04:13:33.060
Ow.

04:13:35.060 --> 04:13:37.060
I think it's written in some sort of word.

04:13:37.060 --> 04:13:39.060
I don't recognize it.

04:13:39.060 --> 04:13:41.060
Oh my gosh.

04:13:41.060 --> 04:13:43.060
It's a book.

04:13:49.060 --> 04:13:51.060
It's not just any book.

04:13:51.060 --> 04:13:53.060
Golly, which one is this?

04:13:53.060 --> 04:13:55.060
Somewhere in the baron?

04:13:55.060 --> 04:13:57.060
Oh.

04:13:57.060 --> 04:13:59.060
We found it.

04:13:59.060 --> 04:14:01.060
A safe.

04:14:01.060 --> 04:14:03.060
Where is that?

04:14:03.060 --> 04:14:05.060
To the cell?

04:14:05.060 --> 04:14:07.060
In that case.

04:14:07.060 --> 04:14:09.060
What do I have to do now?

04:14:09.060 --> 04:14:11.060
And where is the journal?

04:14:11.060 --> 04:14:13.060
Oh cool.

04:14:13.060 --> 04:14:15.060
It might take a while though.

04:14:15.060 --> 04:14:17.060
That's fine.

04:14:17.060 --> 04:14:19.060
Excuse me.

04:14:19.060 --> 04:14:21.060
Gosh.

04:14:21.060 --> 04:14:23.060
You look really tired.

04:14:23.060 --> 04:14:25.060
A little bit.

04:14:25.060 --> 04:14:27.060
Yeah.

04:14:27.060 --> 04:14:29.060
A little bit.

04:14:29.060 --> 04:14:31.060
A little bit.

04:14:31.060 --> 04:14:33.060
So we finished this game like next week.

04:14:43.060 --> 04:14:45.060
Can I just add it?

04:14:45.060 --> 04:14:47.060
Add it.

04:14:47.060 --> 04:14:49.060
Add it.

04:14:49.060 --> 04:14:51.060
Add it.

04:14:51.060 --> 04:14:53.060
Add it.

04:14:55.060 --> 04:14:57.060
I'm so tired.

04:15:05.060 --> 04:15:07.060
I'm not finished yet.

04:15:07.060 --> 04:15:09.060
So it's faster.

04:15:09.060 --> 04:15:11.060
Four parts is insane.

04:15:11.060 --> 04:15:13.060
Am I just slow and dumb?

04:15:17.060 --> 04:15:19.060
Why am I so slow and dumb?

04:15:27.060 --> 04:15:29.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:15:47.060 --> 04:15:49.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:15:49.060 --> 04:15:51.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:15:51.060 --> 04:15:53.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:15:53.060 --> 04:15:55.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:15:55.060 --> 04:15:57.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:15:57.060 --> 04:15:59.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:15:59.060 --> 04:16:01.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:16:01.060 --> 04:16:03.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:16:03.060 --> 04:16:05.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:16:05.060 --> 04:16:07.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:16:07.060 --> 04:16:09.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:16:09.060 --> 04:16:11.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:16:11.060 --> 04:16:13.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:16:13.060 --> 04:16:15.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:16:15.060 --> 04:16:17.060
How could I be so dumb and dumb?

04:16:27.060 --> 04:16:29.060
How could I be so fast and dumb?

04:16:29.060 --> 04:16:31.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:16:31.060 --> 04:16:33.060
How could I be so slow and dumb?

04:16:37.060 --> 04:16:39.060
I can't remember the length of it.

04:16:39.060 --> 04:16:41.060
I keep thinking that I will get through this really fast.
