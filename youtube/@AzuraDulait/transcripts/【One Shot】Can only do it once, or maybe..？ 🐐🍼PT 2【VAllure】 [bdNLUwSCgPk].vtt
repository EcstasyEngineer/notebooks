27:19.080 --> 27:23.080
today

27:27.080 --> 27:31.080
i'm still a little bit upset though i guess i'm a little still upset

27:31.800 --> 27:39.080
i want to see i want to see violence i want to see fighting i want to see blood murder

27:50.080 --> 27:59.080
you know i want to see that i want to see that it's none of that it's none of that it's not fair

28:05.080 --> 28:12.200
it's not much talking it's actually some action it's pretty pretty actiony right now in the last two episodes yeah

28:12.840 --> 28:22.200
pretty actiony but just not the action that i i was expecting i'll put it that way

28:34.600 --> 28:40.120
it's definitely not what i was expecting it was expecting more a little more than what they gave us

28:40.680 --> 28:42.120
what they provided us

28:48.440 --> 29:05.800
i i like tower of god don't get me wrong i've read the comic the comic is amazing

29:06.680 --> 29:15.480
great comic i do not like the anime anime was trash

29:17.880 --> 29:26.840
the animation amazing but the pacing they ruined it they removed so much plot

29:26.840 --> 29:33.720
that it was unnecessary where's the plot they removed so much they changed stuff to make it fit

29:34.360 --> 29:43.400
and it and it didn't make sense i don't i like the comic it's really good anime it's really bad

29:52.600 --> 29:57.800
no hate towards it it's really good you should read it it's really good

29:58.120 --> 30:06.440
it's not gonna be no season two it got a lot of hate got a lot of hate i'd be surprised if

30:06.440 --> 30:13.560
there was a season two honestly if there is i'm surprised i'd be there's no season

30:28.120 --> 30:36.120
my expectations i've been lowered now

30:43.000 --> 30:47.640
it skips a lot it's the same thing with um what anime was that

30:47.800 --> 30:55.960
that school school of god oh brain come on brain you got this

31:03.240 --> 31:04.440
i can't nope can't think of it

31:04.840 --> 31:10.760
but

31:16.360 --> 31:26.760
the god of high school ha ha hey got it yeah yeah brain yeah

31:34.440 --> 31:42.760
ha ha

31:43.960 --> 31:47.880
and the same goes for the god of high school they changed quite a bit in there too they mushed

31:47.880 --> 31:54.600
a lot of episodes together they they ruined the plot in there as well in the anime comic amazing

31:54.600 --> 32:01.160
i i read up to like there's like i read up to like 600 chapters i i lost track

32:01.480 --> 32:07.720
but it was really good it was really good really good comic it derails a lot sometimes

32:07.720 --> 32:14.840
but hey it's all right but they mushed so much together they mushed so much together

32:14.840 --> 32:20.600
they look mashing and it ruined it for me so i didn't want to watch it plus the opening is really

32:20.600 --> 32:26.840
weird i know a lot of people like idiom i love idiom i don't get me wrong i love idiom i love a lot

32:27.800 --> 32:30.360
i like that want want you know you know

32:39.400 --> 32:47.160
but the the opening does not match the theme of the anime itself it was really weird

32:47.880 --> 32:56.280
combination so i couldn't really get into it like i really like music so like an anime theme music

32:56.280 --> 33:04.760
needs to like really really really like draw me and draw me and take me and

33:04.760 --> 33:09.720
take me take me take me take me you know but it didn't take me it didn't take me at all

33:10.840 --> 33:17.400
then like it didn't like it not one bit it was a good song though it would have been really good for

33:17.400 --> 33:26.600
like a like a like a mecca anime or a or like a half kind of like android-y like futuristic kind of anime

33:26.600 --> 33:33.400
you know it would have been really nice for that like it would have got you really in it like oh it's crazy

33:33.400 --> 33:45.560
i like that i like that i like that so much yeah yeah oh yeah yeah sort of like sci-fi yeah

33:47.480 --> 33:55.160
but uh it wasn't it wasn't like that it didn't fit the theme of the anime at all so i couldn't get into it

34:02.920 --> 34:07.560
you've been watching this house needs a classroom yeah it's good i like it i even like the

34:07.560 --> 34:14.040
second season i think they did a really good job with uh each season i like it it's really good

34:14.600 --> 34:21.160
they really and they don't derail from the plot like even them even the filler episodes are still like

34:22.120 --> 34:27.240
with the plot of the anime itself so yeah it's all funny and they're all fun and games and

34:27.240 --> 34:33.720
ha ha he but it doesn't like you don't lose the story it doesn't become like a random filler

34:33.720 --> 34:39.720
whereas like random the plot still stays the same so it's really good

34:40.360 --> 34:48.200
yeah it's the alien the yellow alien teacher yeah yeah yeah

34:52.840 --> 34:59.560
oh i love trigon um i really do who's one of my favorite one of my favorite

34:59.560 --> 35:14.280
animes in the past i love all the oldies all the oldies i didn't watch the new trigon though

35:14.280 --> 35:17.880
the new one that came out they did a remake or something or something like that i don't know if

35:17.880 --> 35:27.640
it's a remake i just know they did read it and it's sort of sort of like cgi cgi ish i think cgi ish

35:27.640 --> 35:34.040
i haven't watched it yet i heard i saw some clips and stuff and it was really amazing so it's on

35:34.040 --> 35:40.440
my list to watch but i'm really nervous to watch og stuff because you know when you watch like really

35:40.440 --> 35:47.400
old stuff it starts and you watch the remix of it it loses the charm it loses the charm that it

35:47.400 --> 35:54.120
once had and it kind of makes me sad so i'm a little afraid a little afraid to

35:54.280 --> 35:59.480
so you don't have into that into that

36:14.600 --> 36:23.240
i also love the art style of kiju number kiju number haven't uh really watched it yet though

36:24.280 --> 36:33.400
but i've seen also like i really like gathering seasonal anime like my habit is i gather

36:34.200 --> 36:40.920
and then i can pick which ones i've been dying to watch and which ones i really want to watch

36:40.920 --> 36:47.560
based off the trailer and i watch those first i binge like i stay up to date with those and then

36:47.560 --> 36:53.480
i let the others sit in the back and like all i wait for all the episodes and stuff to come out

36:53.560 --> 36:56.680
and then i binge those that's how i watch my anime

36:59.960 --> 37:03.640
so there's some things i haven't watched yet and there's some things i'm sitting on and there's

37:03.640 --> 37:09.080
some things i've been spoiled or like i stopped watching stuff i've been spoiled on and i wait

37:09.080 --> 37:14.920
like a few weeks for my brain to forget and then i'll go back and watch it so yeah

37:17.640 --> 37:21.720
it's okay you're not late there's no lateness here

37:23.560 --> 37:32.120
i love binge watching but sometimes hard to wait it is very hard to wait it's very hard

37:35.480 --> 37:41.160
i have i spoke about the spice and wolf one too i've seen the original i know the whole song of the

37:41.160 --> 37:48.520
original the ending song i have not seen the new one yet

38:11.160 --> 38:22.520
the world

38:41.720 --> 38:52.520
and

39:00.760 --> 39:05.080
yeah i like spice and wolf a lot oh it's quite a lot of anime

39:06.040 --> 39:12.200
i'm surprised like it got to the point where i can no longer remember the anime i've watched

39:12.760 --> 39:18.600
that's how bad it is i've watched too much anime even i can say that i've watched too much anime

39:18.600 --> 39:25.160
way too much way too much that if someone were to ask me to give them a recommendation like on the spot

39:25.160 --> 39:31.480
i wouldn't be able to think of any one anime that i'll only be able to say right away is a really good

39:31.560 --> 39:38.840
starter anime is hunter x hunter that's it and then and then after that i'd probably name some new anime

39:41.880 --> 39:49.080
i'm really bad at recommending anime because i can never remember any any uh

39:49.880 --> 39:57.080
like i my brain likes to be like well what if they don't like old anime if you send them straight

39:57.080 --> 40:03.880
away to old anime they might not watch it because of the art style and i know how new people are to anime

40:03.880 --> 40:10.760
they will not watch something if the art looks stupid if it doesn't look like hd look clean or blah blah

40:10.760 --> 40:16.680
no one will watch it no one will watch it yeah i used to recommend death no but like i said people don't

40:16.680 --> 40:24.360
like the art style new people these new generations they don't like it they don't like the art style

40:24.360 --> 40:27.720
they will not watch it so i stopped recommending it

40:33.640 --> 40:41.160
but hunter x hunter is like really clean with their animation um uh the remake of hunter x hunter

40:41.160 --> 40:49.000
the remake the remake uh and formal alchemist brotherhood yelp is also a good recommendation

40:49.640 --> 40:58.520
but uh i just feel sad recommending full metal alchemist brotherhood only because the original is so good

40:59.640 --> 41:06.280
it's so good because they don't like they give you the emotion emotional attachment to the characters

41:06.840 --> 41:13.000
by doing the side stories by doing the other stuff brotherhood just takes that away to make it shorter

41:13.000 --> 41:19.240
so that you only watch the main plot and the original the original ending

41:20.760 --> 41:30.600
of full metal alchemist isn't canon sadly it isn't canon but apparently brotherhood's ending is canon

41:32.040 --> 41:39.960
so that's that's what makes it sad so it's a little sloppy it's a little messy i like the original i like

41:39.960 --> 41:44.600
feeling attachment to the characters i like feeling how they feel and so it's at work

41:44.680 --> 42:10.040
i hope you guys don't mind us just chilling out for a second

42:10.440 --> 42:15.080
before we play one shot

42:20.600 --> 42:24.280
never watch hunter x hunter you're missing out better get the watch in

42:25.800 --> 42:32.680
missing out get the watch in right after stream though what right after stream not right now

42:33.400 --> 42:45.000
yep spyax family is also a good recommendation but like i said spyax family is still a new anime

42:45.000 --> 42:50.200
technically still a new anime just because of the season 2 does not make it an old anime it is brand new

42:51.560 --> 42:59.000
it is brand new uh so it's you can only recommend anime that are like two years old to people now

42:59.720 --> 43:03.480
because no one's gonna watch the old stuff if it's if the animation's not good

43:05.800 --> 43:08.840
if the animation's not good they're not gonna watch it you know they're gonna be like

43:08.840 --> 43:17.400
ah that's just trash that's trash artwork trash ah that's terrible terrible and then they'll

43:17.400 --> 43:23.240
talk about how dbz is the main one that's amazing well nothing's on there's nothing on dbz

43:24.040 --> 43:28.920
there's nothing on there don't get me wrong i like dbz i watch all of it even super even

43:28.920 --> 43:41.640
super i watch it but that's literally what people say there's nothing on dbz like okay all right

43:43.320 --> 43:50.040
okay i try i even it's it's starting to get sad that i recommend Naruto to people and people are like

43:50.120 --> 43:58.680
like irl gross all because of the old artwork in the original when they were in the when they

43:58.680 --> 44:03.240
were younger because that's why i tell them to watch first when they're younger and animation

44:03.240 --> 44:13.160
when they were younger is it is a memory it's nostalgia all right

44:13.640 --> 44:23.000
so tokyo gu is also a good starter that's true i also recommend that

44:24.040 --> 44:30.520
that's a good starter if you haven't watched any anime tokyo gu tokyo gu uh however

44:31.640 --> 44:36.680
i will say i always forget this i am only gonna say i like tokyo gu season one

44:36.680 --> 44:47.960
i hate the fact that the next season like forces you to read the manga in order for you to be up to date

44:48.680 --> 44:54.600
and i think that's dumb i think this is the dumbest thing any any any anime any show you have a tv show i don't

44:54.600 --> 45:00.360
care what show it is i don't care i don't care i don't care i don't care i don't i don't i don't care

45:00.920 --> 45:11.880
i think it's the dumbest thing that any show could ever do why why why just add it add it in the end

45:11.880 --> 45:16.120
season two that's the whole point of you making it into an anime so i could watch it with my eyeballs

45:16.120 --> 45:23.800
with my eyeballs watch the animation with my eyeballs i want to see moving pictures i want

45:23.800 --> 45:30.200
to see flashing lights i want to see all of it i i don't i don't i don't i don't like the fact that they

45:30.200 --> 45:39.240
they force you to go read the manga and then you can watch season two season one banger banger

45:53.960 --> 46:05.160
why did you choose brad to cover i like brad you know man it's only hair because i like brad

46:06.200 --> 46:07.800
brad don't you like brad

46:07.800 --> 46:09.800
what

46:15.880 --> 46:24.200
they're reanimating original nardo no no no no no no

46:26.440 --> 46:29.880

46:30.040 --> 46:39.160

51:29.240 --> 51:31.240
from everything from the interviews and everything that was read

51:31.240 --> 51:33.240
he admitted it himself

51:33.240 --> 51:35.240
so i don't know

51:35.240 --> 51:37.240
i don't know everything was set up for rukia

51:37.240 --> 51:39.240
and i'm rukia gang all the way

51:41.240 --> 51:43.240
rukia gang all the way

51:43.240 --> 51:45.240
rukia gang

51:45.240 --> 51:47.240
rukia gang

51:47.240 --> 51:49.240
rukia gang

51:49.240 --> 51:51.240
i love yoriichi

51:51.240 --> 51:53.240
but i mean like main female

51:53.240 --> 51:55.240
like character

51:55.240 --> 51:57.240
like

51:57.240 --> 51:59.240
from the whole plot of the story

51:59.240 --> 52:01.240
like main, who, ichigo, you know

52:01.240 --> 52:03.240
you know

52:03.240 --> 52:05.240
i don't like orihime

52:05.240 --> 52:07.240
i literally she claims she likes

52:07.240 --> 52:09.240
she likes

52:09.240 --> 52:11.240
male lead

52:11.240 --> 52:13.240
male lead will never give up on trying to save people

52:13.240 --> 52:15.240
let herself get kidnapped

52:15.240 --> 52:17.240
no she didn't like

52:17.240 --> 52:19.240
get kidnapped

52:19.240 --> 52:21.240
no she walked into the arms of the enemy

52:21.240 --> 52:23.240
and then was like

52:23.240 --> 52:25.240
why are you fighting to save me

52:25.240 --> 52:27.240
oh my god

52:27.240 --> 52:29.240
i don't i don't i don't

52:29.240 --> 52:31.240
i i

52:31.240 --> 52:33.240
i hate when they

52:33.240 --> 52:35.240
when they make female characters

52:35.240 --> 52:37.240
those forced damsels

52:37.240 --> 52:39.240
in distress

52:39.240 --> 52:41.240
she didn't have to go

52:41.240 --> 52:43.240
she didn't have to do that

52:43.240 --> 52:45.240
she didn't have to do that

52:45.240 --> 52:47.240
it wasn't necessary

52:47.240 --> 52:49.240
it wasn't necessary

52:55.240 --> 52:57.240
hueco mundo was literally

52:57.240 --> 52:59.240
preventable yes yes i agree

53:01.240 --> 53:03.240
ouch i hit my arm

53:09.240 --> 53:11.240
it was preventable

53:11.240 --> 53:13.240
it was

53:19.240 --> 53:21.240
but they needed something

53:21.240 --> 53:23.240
they needed something to get them to do things

53:23.240 --> 53:25.240
i guess i guess

53:25.240 --> 53:27.240
so she was the anchor

53:27.240 --> 53:29.240
she was the forced anchor

53:29.240 --> 53:31.240
i guess

53:31.240 --> 53:33.240
i don't like orihime

53:33.240 --> 53:35.240
she made me angry

53:35.240 --> 53:37.240
your iti is

53:37.240 --> 53:39.240
the bomb

53:39.240 --> 53:41.240
and i

53:41.240 --> 53:43.240

53:43.240 --> 53:45.240

53:45.240 --> 53:47.240

53:47.240 --> 53:49.240

you

53:53.240 --> 53:55.240

53:55.240 --> 53:57.240
my favorite character is

53:57.240 --> 53:59.240
in bleed

53:59.240 --> 54:01.240
i

54:03.240 --> 54:05.240

To be there. She didn't need to go anywhere. She put herself in a situation she didn't need to be in.

55:39.140 --> 55:47.140
I guess the only reason why they needed her to go was to give emotion to the antagonist.

55:47.140 --> 55:57.140
The antagonist needed to gain something, a feeling or something. And the only person that can give that to him was Orohime.

55:57.140 --> 56:03.140
I'm trying not to say too much without much spoiling.

56:15.140 --> 56:19.140
He needed a reason. He needed something, some feelings.

56:19.140 --> 56:23.140
Orohime was I guess the only person that can really give that to him.

56:24.140 --> 56:26.140
That's what I have.

56:26.140 --> 56:29.140
I hate when stories kind of like force.

56:29.140 --> 56:32.140
Like it feels so forced.

56:34.140 --> 56:40.140
Like who thinks that? Who goes I'm just gonna go to the enemy. I have no other choice.

56:42.140 --> 56:49.140
And then act surprised when the characters spent like how many seasons saving people

56:49.140 --> 56:53.140
And acting as if the person would never save you.

56:53.140 --> 56:55.140
And then you wish him a goodbye.

56:55.140 --> 57:04.140
Goodbye. Don't worry about me. Don't come for me. I'm sorry. Goodbye.

57:09.140 --> 57:13.140
I also like Grimjall a lot. I guess he'd be my third favorite.

57:13.140 --> 57:16.140
Grimjall Jaggerjack. I like Grimjall.

57:17.140 --> 57:20.140
Yeah, he'd be my third.

57:35.140 --> 57:38.140
How disrespectful he was during a fight. True.

57:41.140 --> 57:45.140
I really just like them delinquents. I don't know.

57:46.140 --> 57:52.140
He's so cute. His little bells and his little tenet.

57:52.140 --> 57:56.140
He won't kill a puppy. He didn't want to kill baby.

58:08.140 --> 58:11.140
It's a new anime of Bleach. I heard it at Remake.

58:11.140 --> 58:15.140
It's not really a remake. It's more like a new season. Like a continuation.

58:16.140 --> 58:20.140
So yeah, it's out now. Actually, I haven't seen it yet though.

58:21.140 --> 58:23.140
I haven't seen it yet.

58:25.140 --> 58:29.140
I don't like cliffhangers when it comes to that show. So I'm waiting.

58:31.140 --> 58:35.140
It's like a new season. How many years? Excuse me.

58:35.140 --> 58:37.140
Excuse me.

58:40.140 --> 58:43.140
Oh, my throat. Oh my gosh.

58:45.140 --> 58:50.140
How many years? It's been a long time.

58:53.140 --> 58:56.140
You thought Bleach ended officially? No, it did not.

58:56.140 --> 59:00.140
Bleach, when Bleach ended, the manga was still ongoing.

59:00.140 --> 59:04.140
The manga never stopped. The manga kept going.

59:04.140 --> 59:06.140
So it did not end.

59:09.140 --> 59:19.140
Sadly, it's because a lot of people in the fanbase pressured the author to make more.

59:19.140 --> 59:24.140
I think he made an interview where he said he didn't want to make more.

59:25.140 --> 59:28.140
But he was pressured to make more.

59:31.140 --> 59:33.140
So the manga kept going.

59:34.140 --> 59:35.140
parameters

59:44.140 --> 59:46.140
Yeah.

59:50.140 --> 59:51.140
I think so.

but i i don't like repetitive things i really don't but i really do like one piece

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:44.500
but the beginning one piece was really good and then i don't know what happened

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:51.220
it just it just started to get worse and worse as time went

01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:04.260
i did not read the manga of jujutsu kaisen unfortunately no

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:13.620
i am not up to date with jujutsu kaisen either i watched the movie the movie and then i stopped there

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:20.100
i didn't watch the new season i'm scared i saw spoilers so i like stopped what i stopped

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:25.860
and i don't want to watch anything yet until my brain forgets some things i already forgot a bunch

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:34.340
of things so please don't spoil please i beg please please i already saw saw saw some spoilers

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.540

sorry i was reading

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:32.100
i like oh my god that's that's

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:41.380
that's that's that's yep you're right you're right the first season of rising uh rising of

01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:51.780
shield hero amazing it was great i loved it it was good i loved season one season two

01:02:52.580 --> 01:03:04.900
was all right but the ending was rushed then season three came and it was boring it was boring

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:16.340
it was bad it was bad i don't like season three and i and i and i i haven't even watched it

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:22.100
the rest of it i don't like it i like i even try to come back to watching it again i got like

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:29.300
try it again three episode rule three episode rule watch three episodes and see where it takes

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:35.060
you i watch three episodes i'm like all right this is it season episode the fourth episode

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:41.780
should be something crazy right something yeah i watch episode four what is this what is happening

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:45.540
i'm i don't i don't

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:56.340
try to watch another no i can't do this i don't know what is this i don't want it i don't want it

01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:03.460
no i'm okay i'm not gonna watch this i'm not i'm taking this off my list uh uh trash

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:14.100
you gotta finish season two i forced myself to get through season two i forced myself

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:19.780
you want to know how you want to know how i got through season two you want to know how i got

01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:35.220
through season two of rise and to hero so whenever i started whenever i started an episode

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:44.340
i would take season one's opening song play it skip the season two opening song

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:52.340
so

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:12.340
that's how that's how i got through it

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:14.900
so

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:22.500
you just couldn't do that for season three it just didn't work that way it was so boring

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.100
gaslighting yourself

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:36.100
so the the opening for season one was so good come on

01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:41.060
it was so good

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:52.180
one piece favorite character is zoro um i'm um zoro

01:05:55.060 --> 01:06:05.620
i think i think that's i think that i don't think i don't think uh i guess zoro and robin robin robin robin

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:12.420
yeah zoro zoro my favorite one piece character ace was

01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:18.260
white beard was

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:32.020
and now we have now i'm left with zoro and luffy those are my two favorite characters the main character

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.940
and zoro

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:09.220
um almost unprecedented levels of culture from i just watched too much anime

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:14.740
i don't leave home so i just watched too much anime

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:22.260
i've watched quite a lot of anime so much actually

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:28.180
yeah oh my gosh we've been chilling here for an hour

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:32.340
we're gonna be streaming for quite some time

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:44.260
it's already been an hour holy shit

01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:48.660
i mean

01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:57.540
we haven't even started playing the game i was so worried about the lag

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:09.540
i was so worried about the lag it was so weird

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:20.900
um

01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:30.020
do i have a favorite anime or genre you can't ask me that question

01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:38.420
i don't i don't have a i don't have a favorite anime i i have a current favorite anime

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:43.460
i don't have an all-time favorite anime i have a bunch of all-time favorite anime

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:48.260
but i can't put them on a wait on a wait and weigh them

01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:54.100
like which is better i can't do that i've watched too many i can't do that

01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:03.140
least favorite anime my brain probably forgot them so i can't think of them right now

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:07.860
you know how when something was like really bad experience when you were watching it

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:13.380
so your brain blocked it out so your brain just blocks it out

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:19.700
not can't think of one

01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:30.500
but i'm on my current favorite right now that is even topping slime at the moment

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:34.900
slime and tsukimichi because tsukimichi is also just talking at the moment

01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:38.420
uh they they're doing the same thing as slime

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:44.100
he really doesn't want to fight he's like avoiding fighting by doing other things

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:50.260
and there's too many cliffhangers he was falling for this from the sky for two episodes

01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:54.180
i i two episodes he was falling from the sky i don't know

01:09:56.420 --> 01:10:01.060
and it was just going to everyone else i don't care about everyone else i want to see him fight

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:09.780
uh what if i want to see him murder die die die kill kill kill you know yeah yeah

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:19.780
so um right now my the anime i'm watching at at the moment that has like really god-tier animation

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:26.900
i think the animation is crazy my eyes are blessed uh seventh prince reincarnate into the seventh prince

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:29.780
um something about focus on non-magic

01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:35.220
something about focusing on magic i could pull it up hang on

01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:45.060
it's like right here bam right in my face as the seventh prince so i can take my time

01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:52.020
perfecting my magical ability you know god-tier animation mcs hellcube

01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:52.980
uh

01:10:55.700 --> 01:11:01.300
muskwish so adorable i like characters who are absolutely insane

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:07.540
i love that i love revenge i like people who don't care about other people

01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:12.100
and people who are absolutely op for no reason

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:20.100
and i like seeing people scared in shock when they belittle someone because of their appearance

01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:27.620
i like it i like it a lot like take that you thought he was just a child he thought he was just weak

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:31.060
he's gonna absolutely destroy you

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:44.980
it's good i like it a lot i i say it's a muskwatch for me

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:51.860
i'm also watching remonster it's good for like a like a

01:11:53.060 --> 01:12:00.340
you uh board kind of thing and you like just want to chill and watch something that tells a story in a little

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:08.580
in a in a different way so remonster is pretty good the opening was made fun of a lot

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:11.620
but it kind of grows on you as you keep watching

01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:21.060
and the opening was really weird the animation of the opening is weird the opening song itself

01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:28.260
is pretty amazing it's good the song is good but whoever made the animation for the opening

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:35.700
whoever made the animation is questionable it's questionable

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:44.500
the song is good the anime is good the opening of the animations

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:52.340
strange yeah remonster remonster yeah yeah yeah

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:00.500
it's about goblins

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:14.420
someone got reincarnated as a a monster i think and that's the the rest is you find out by watching it

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:19.220
i can't really say much or everything i'll say about the show is basically a spoiler

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:23.620
go watch it i am

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:35.540
it was always a harem anime though it was always a harem anime i guess what made people

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:41.380
kind of like it more is that the main the emcee doesn't doesn't freak out

01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:50.820
like like all the original emcees when they're around a bunch of girls they freak out or they play dumb

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:58.820
or they're scared or they're terrified uh yada yada yada this emcee is not like that at all

01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:07.380
he accepts everything with open arms and he's very uh logical and stuff about it

01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:10.900
but he's like a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:21.380
and i think that's i guess his own appeal to it so it's always been a harem even in the manga so yeah

01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:26.820
so if you weren't ready for it yeah

01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:37.300
yeah i'm not a big fan of harem either but i like the plot of the story itself of where everything leads

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:45.300
uh it keeps you interested um the i guess you'd call it random fanservice

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.940
then it's a big old fanservice

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:55.460
yeah the harem part of the manga was a little too much

01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:05.380
i'm not a huge fan of uh harem harem anime but there are just some that are good

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.220
only some that are good

01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:26.740
and maybe i should start on one shot you guys ready to uh watch one shot

01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:34.580
i see some people are still getting the crash or uh the stream end somehow unfortunately

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:39.860
i must be so annoying i really wish i can do something about that

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:48.500

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:48.100
heavy but i do watch some anime in english dubs some of my favorite voice actors are in english dubs

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:55.300
but the newer voice actors lately aren't doing it for me they don't get into their role

01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:58.900
it sounds like they don't care and i hate that i think that sucks

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:02.020
hey why don't you care you need to care

01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:14.820

it was him in the bed i feel so bad well no that's so sad

01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:43.540
that's so scary but what crazy attention to detail is that what the hell

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.060
why would they do that

01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:46.660
what

01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:51.140
i'm so sad

01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:56.100

hi you i'm catching fireflies for mommy

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:17.940
how cute is this like a village

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:22.900
look like crab shells filled with smelt right fish

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:25.940
it's full of fish heads

01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:29.380
these are filled with smelt right fish

01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:30.980
oh

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:37.780
it's like emotional damage uh maybe that made me really sad

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:43.780
hmm nothing's fighting i talked to him it's all you're there

01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:50.420
so are you going here

01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:53.540
hi person

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:59.460
there was a time where our people used to live in these runs

01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:05.540
but due to the flooding most of us have moved to the less permanent settlement

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:10.820
flooding a the land has gotten brittle

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.940
and glenn used to be in one piece you know

01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:21.300
but now it's just a bunch of islands that get smaller and smaller uh

01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:26.500
is that it do you still live here sorry though

01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:35.220
fish populations near the village are thinning so we fisher folk are making temporary shelter here

01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:40.340
makes sense the deeper ruins have been abandoned for a while though

01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:47.380
well i do see some kids coming in and out of those i think they actually live there

01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:54.260
i hope those kids are safe one core it's fish too

01:22:56.180 --> 01:23:03.940
empty jar jar worms bros he i actually used to play with worms when i was a kid

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:10.740
when i was a kid i used to play with worms but well really a mattress

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:20.340
i used to play with worms i was the biggest tomboy when i was uh young

01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:24.740
i used to play in the dirt

01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:38.260
did i used to eat worms no but i used to eat chalk

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:47.780
daddy says the world is very sick well azura can make it better again

01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:57.540

01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:15.140

01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:26.980

01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:30.740

01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:43.380

01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:42.980
okay i'm sorry i apologize

01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:48.660
most of the green moss covering our village has already lost its glow

01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:57.700
if it wasn't for the thin strip left on the bowl boundaries of the land people could easily

01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:06.020
fall into the ocean without light and water becomes indistinguishable here

01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:10.020

it doesn't matter one day the world will finally give this give up this fight

01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:04.340

02:05:56.280 --> 02:06:13.640
further further further

02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:22.280
the edges are glowing yellow it's a sacred feather

02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:28.200

what or something like that she gave me she gave one of her feathers

02:06:57.240 --> 02:07:04.440
to father before she died father used to pass this down as a heirloom although

02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:11.560
it feels more fitting for you to have it all right are you sure totally sure i think that's

02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:18.280
what father would have wanted thank you i have a feather now you know who i'm gonna give it to

her health rapidly deteriorated oh i'm glad you were able to find her in time

02:07:54.040 --> 02:08:00.280

02:15:53.180 --> 02:16:05.180
The south is a peninsula inhabited by my rams. They are all standing and for unfortunate spots. You have to move them onto the darker moths.

02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:21.180
If you get stuck, ring a bell, and they'll all return to their original positions. Good luck.

02:16:24.180 --> 02:16:25.180
Over here.

02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:37.180
If you ring the bell, do you move, you do.

02:16:54.180 --> 02:16:56.180
Ring the bell.

02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:01.180
Ring the bell.

02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:04.180
Ring the bell.

02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:09.180
Ring the bell.

02:17:10.180 --> 02:17:12.180
Ring the bell.

02:17:18.180 --> 02:17:21.180
Wait, if I pushed them into the corner, wouldn't I get stuck?

02:17:22.180 --> 02:17:24.180
Ring the bell.

02:17:25.180 --> 02:17:27.180
Oh no, I get stuck.

02:17:29.180 --> 02:17:30.180
Oh no.

02:17:31.180 --> 02:17:33.180
Hang on, I got this, I'm smart.

02:17:34.180 --> 02:17:36.180
Ring the bell.

02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:42.180
Ring the bell.

02:17:53.180 --> 02:17:55.180
I'm not smart.

02:17:55.180 --> 02:17:57.180
I'm not smart.

02:18:10.180 --> 02:18:12.180
Ring the bell.

02:18:30.180 --> 02:18:32.180
Ring the bell.

02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:37.180
Ring the bell.

02:18:40.180 --> 02:18:42.180
Ring the bell.

02:18:51.180 --> 02:18:53.180
I'm smart.

02:18:54.180 --> 02:18:56.180
Ring the bell.

02:19:05.180 --> 02:19:06.180
Thank you.

02:19:06.180 --> 02:19:10.180
It was all thanks to you guys believing in me that I could do it.

02:19:12.180 --> 02:19:14.180
Thanks everyone.

02:19:16.180 --> 02:19:20.180
You've provided a great service for all of Ramkind.

02:19:21.180 --> 02:19:28.180
In return, I take this fine ram little things.

02:19:34.180 --> 02:19:36.180
You're heading to the city, aren't you?

02:19:36.180 --> 02:19:38.180
Been there, done that.

02:19:38.180 --> 02:19:40.180
Too cramped, you know?

02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:43.180
True.

02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:48.180
But it's not like this place, it's getting any bigger.

02:19:48.180 --> 02:19:51.180
The rising waters and all.

02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:54.180
Maybe the city isn't so bad after all.

02:19:55.180 --> 02:19:58.180
You won't be able to take your rams with you.

02:20:01.180 --> 02:20:04.180
What are you gonna do with your rams?

02:20:18.180 --> 02:20:20.180
Ring the bell.

02:20:26.180 --> 02:20:28.180
Ring the bell.

02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:46.180
Ring the bell.

02:20:49.180 --> 02:20:52.180
I think I have something I'd like to trade.

02:20:52.180 --> 02:20:54.180
You'll take wool, right?

02:20:54.180 --> 02:20:56.180
What can this wool get me?

02:20:56.180 --> 02:20:58.180
Wool?

02:20:58.180 --> 02:21:03.180
That'll get you this fine pile of...

02:21:03.180 --> 02:21:05.180
I'm not sure what this is actually.

02:21:05.180 --> 02:21:07.180
Some sort of fabric dye?

02:21:10.180 --> 02:21:12.180
How about a Zura?

02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:17.180
Should I?

02:21:18.180 --> 02:21:20.180
We need fabric dye?

02:21:33.180 --> 02:21:35.180
Should I?

02:21:35.180 --> 02:21:37.180
Should I check if it's fabric dye?

02:21:37.180 --> 02:21:39.180
Minecraft zombie.

02:21:44.180 --> 02:21:46.180
It's like underwater.

02:21:48.180 --> 02:21:50.180

02:21:50.180 --> 02:21:52.180

02:22:14.180 --> 02:22:16.180
It's like...

02:22:16.180 --> 02:22:18.180
It's like...

02:22:32.180 --> 02:22:34.180
It's a drowned zombie.

I mean, eels are edible.

02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:54.160
They're definitely edible.

02:27:56.160 --> 02:27:58.160
They're about.

02:28:04.160 --> 02:28:06.160

It's not just Reese's Puff. No, it is not.

02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:15.160
Wait, no.

02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:17.160
It's full of snakes.

02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:21.160
That's worse.

02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:31.160
You're getting snakes.

02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:37.160
Those aren't fish or eels.

02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:45.160
It's on here.

02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:52.160
Water sample collecting and process.

02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:56.160
And progress.

02:28:57.160 --> 02:28:59.160
I've been over here.

02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:02.160
I haven't been over here.

02:29:03.160 --> 02:29:05.160
What's over here?

02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:14.160
I like snakes.

02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:17.160
Snakes are so cute. Don't eat snakes.

02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:19.160
I know people who do.

02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:24.160
I can tell you a story about a snake experience.

02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:32.160
My auntie used to have a big snake.

02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:34.160
They couldn't keep the snake anymore.

02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:36.160
So their neighbor.

02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:39.160
We can take your snake.

02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:44.160
And she gave the snake to them.

02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:46.160
And they've had the snake for years.

02:29:48.160 --> 02:29:50.160
And she gave them the snake.

02:29:52.160 --> 02:29:55.160
And do you know what they do with the snake?

02:29:55.160 --> 02:29:57.160
They ate it.

02:29:57.160 --> 02:29:59.160
They ate the snake.

02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:02.160
They ate the snake.

02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:04.160
They ate it.

02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:06.160
They ate the snake.

02:30:08.160 --> 02:30:10.160
They ate her snake.

02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:20.160
She was so upset.

02:30:20.160 --> 02:30:22.160
She was so angry.

02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:24.160
She was so sad.

02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:26.160
It was a really big snake.

02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:34.160
This is the research station.

02:30:34.160 --> 02:30:36.160
Hello.

02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:40.160
Are you Zenhera by Dr. Silver Plant?

02:30:40.160 --> 02:30:42.160
No.

02:30:50.160 --> 02:30:52.160
Here we are then.

02:30:55.160 --> 02:30:57.160
Hello person. Welcome to the research station.

02:30:57.160 --> 02:30:59.160
Hello.

02:30:59.160 --> 02:31:01.160
Did Dr. Silver Plant send you?

02:31:01.160 --> 02:31:02.160
No.

02:31:02.160 --> 02:31:03.160
Matazura.

02:31:03.160 --> 02:31:05.160
Oh, carry on then.

02:31:10.160 --> 02:31:12.160
Oh, not here.

02:31:14.160 --> 02:31:16.160
How come you're red instead of green?

02:31:16.160 --> 02:31:20.160
Well, more of a purple than red.

02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:22.160
But your eyes and stuff are red.

02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:26.160
I'm only here to pick up this week's small sample.

02:31:26.160 --> 02:31:29.160
I'll return to my station in the city soon.

02:31:29.160 --> 02:31:31.160
I see it.

02:31:32.160 --> 02:31:35.160
I am in charge of collecting the small samples.

02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:37.160
Cool.

02:31:49.160 --> 02:31:53.160
Phosphoric trees are now being protected under the new laws.

02:31:53.160 --> 02:31:55.160
Please do not harvest them.

02:31:55.160 --> 02:31:57.160
I'm not.

02:31:58.160 --> 02:32:02.160
Phosphoric trees reduce the blade.

02:32:08.160 --> 02:32:10.160

02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:29.160

02:32:29.160 --> 02:32:31.160
Abnormality.

02:32:31.160 --> 02:32:33.160
What is that thing?

02:32:33.160 --> 02:32:36.160
An anomaly.

02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:38.160
An anomaly.

02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:40.160
Oh, anomaly.

02:32:44.160 --> 02:32:46.160
Can someone teach me English?

02:32:46.160 --> 02:32:48.160
Because I don't know English.

02:32:48.160 --> 02:32:51.160
Can someone please teach me English?

02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:59.160
Why are words so hard?

02:32:59.160 --> 02:33:03.160
Words should not be this hard.

02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:19.160
I am not a teacher. I can't teach you.

02:33:19.160 --> 02:33:22.160
Become one so that you can't teach me.

02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:29.160
Well, yeah, but...

02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:34.160
I used to go to speech therapy.

02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:38.160
Because I had a hard time saying certain words.

02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:42.160
And I have an issue with drawing out my sentences.

02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:48.160
Even like I'm doing right now.

02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:51.160
And I have a stuttering problem.

02:33:51.160 --> 02:33:53.160
So I used to go to speech therapy.

02:33:53.160 --> 02:33:55.160
I didn't help.

02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:04.160
I saw someone mention themselves about it somewhere.

02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:06.160
I think it was in the comments somewhere.

02:34:06.160 --> 02:34:08.160
And I relate to that.

02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:11.160
Because they didn't help me at all either.

02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:17.160
I was in speech therapy for years.

02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:22.160
People...

02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:25.160

Hello, living person.

02:34:29.160 --> 02:34:34.160
Hello, I have collected a duplicate water sample.

02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:36.160
Would you like it?

02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:41.160
My programming says that organic beans need water to survive.

02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:43.160
So I shall offer it to you.

02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:46.160
Oh sure, take it.

02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:24.160

02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:52.160
um

02:35:52.160 --> 02:35:54.160
mercy was talking about

02:35:54.160 --> 02:35:56.160
some nip nap

02:35:56.160 --> 02:35:58.160
nip nap cream

02:35:58.160 --> 02:36:00.160

i want that so bad

02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:10.160
she said it could work

02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:12.160
for your

02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:14.160
for your lips

02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:18.160
i had crazy dry lips

02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:20.160
i had the cream on my lips all the time

02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:28.160
for the nip naps

02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:36.160
it was very educational

02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:38.160
very educational conversation

02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:44.160
i was taking notes

02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:46.160
she even showed the picture

02:36:46.160 --> 02:36:48.160
i took a screenshot

02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:50.160
give me give me give me

02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:52.160
i'm gonna get this

02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:02.160
i suffer from really dry skin as well

02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:04.160
so

02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:08.160
i understand

02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:10.160
but mine is a little different

02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:12.160
as i have blotches

02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:14.160
a special lotion

02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:18.160
i have a special lotion that i use

02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:24.160
i dropped a cereal on the floor

02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:26.160
i'm gonna end up stepping on that later

02:37:26.160 --> 02:37:28.160
i found that

02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:34.160
i have a special lotion

02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:36.160
that i use for my

02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:38.160
for those spots

02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:40.160
they help a lot

02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:44.160
but

02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:48.160
if i don't use the lotion

02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:50.160
much

02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:52.160
i end up really drying up

02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:56.160
this is why i'm only allowed to take a shower

02:37:56.160 --> 02:37:58.160
once every other day

02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:00.160
or once every two days

02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:02.160
because too much water can make me

02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:04.160
start peeling like a lizard

02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:10.160
i become a full on lizard

02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:12.160
i become a full on lizard

02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:14.160
start peeling

02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:24.160
what's in here

02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:26.160
hello person

02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:34.160
earlier

02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:36.160
in a place across the ocean

02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:38.160
this generator does not need to be fixed right now

02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:40.160

02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:42.160

02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:44.160

02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:46.160
silver instead of skin

02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:48.160
it's like a bath

02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:50.160
it's like a bath in your own filth

02:41:56.160 --> 02:41:58.160
she's gone

02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:00.160
she's gone

02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:06.160
the light's gone out

02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:08.160
zura

02:42:08.160 --> 02:42:10.160

02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:30.160

02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:32.160
oh there's something on the ground here

02:42:34.160 --> 02:42:36.160

Is it you? Are you allergic to shower?

02:46:22.480 --> 02:46:26.720
No, it's not me. I'm not allergic to shower.

02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:33.440
It's like an old friend all the way in the past when I was a kid.

02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:40.960
I haven't seen them in a long time. It's been many many many years.

02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:44.400
I also knew someone who was allergic to the sun.

02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:46.960
I knew someone who was allergic to the sun rays.

02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:51.760
They would break out into heavy heavy rash.

Ah, he's home.

02:47:50.040 --> 02:47:56.040
I'm holding my niko plushie right now.

02:47:56.040 --> 02:47:59.040
I'm squeezing out.

Niko so cute.

02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:10.040
Azura had another dream. Did you see this one too?

02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:12.040
Yeah.

02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:16.040
I was in a big field like the one in my last dream.

02:48:16.040 --> 02:48:19.040
And I saw my village.

02:48:19.040 --> 02:48:22.040
But I only woke up.

02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:29.040
Ah, I don't think this world has anything like that.

02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:34.040
I mean, big wheat fields.

02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:41.040
The only big plants I've seen here are a bunch of weird trees.

02:48:41.040 --> 02:48:44.040
And these balls of moss floating in the water.

02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:48.040
Wait, is moss even a plant?

02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:51.040
Say, have you seen a wheat field before?

02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:54.040
Yes, I have.

02:48:54.040 --> 02:49:01.040
A long, long time ago, I used to live in one.

02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:05.040
It was massive. It was pretty.

02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:09.040
There's a lot of dragonflies everywhere.

02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:10.040
Yes.

02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:13.040
Oh, really pretty, aren't they?

02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:18.040
It is very pretty, especially when the sun's up.

02:49:18.040 --> 02:49:24.040
The one around my village goes around for miles.

02:49:24.040 --> 02:49:27.040
I have a really bad throat, so I don't know.

02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:30.040
Hydrating isn't always gonna help.

02:49:30.040 --> 02:49:34.040
So it's okay, don't worry about it.

02:49:34.040 --> 02:49:39.040
I will keep hydrating though, so don't you worry.

02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:54.040
I have more water right here.

02:49:54.040 --> 02:49:58.040
Plants are really tall, sometimes I can't even see through them.

02:49:58.040 --> 02:50:02.040
When it's windy out, the wind can make waves in it.

02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:05.040
It's like an ocean of food.

02:50:05.040 --> 02:50:08.040
Oh wait, there's food in regular oceans too.

02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:10.040
Like fish or crabs.

02:50:10.040 --> 02:50:15.040
I've never actually been to a real ocean until now, actually.

02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:17.040
I've been to the ocean.

02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:19.040
Really?

02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:22.040
That's really cool, Azura.

02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:26.040
I've only seen the ocean on TV before.

02:50:26.040 --> 02:50:31.040
I've never thought I'd get to ride on a boat through water.

02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:33.040
I can't read.

02:50:33.040 --> 02:50:36.040
I never thought I'd get to ride a boat through one.

02:50:36.040 --> 02:50:43.040
The water back home doesn't have glowy stuff like how it is here either.

02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:47.040
But I guess it's because the world is already so dark.

02:50:53.040 --> 02:50:56.040
Are you getting sleepy?

02:50:56.040 --> 02:50:58.040
It's okay to fall asleep.

02:50:58.040 --> 02:51:04.040
I don't mind you all resting your eyes if you find yourself falling asleep to the stream.

02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:06.040
It's okay.

02:51:17.040 --> 02:51:19.040
Are you just waking up in the morning?

02:51:20.040 --> 02:51:23.040
It's alright. Time to let the differences be.

02:51:25.040 --> 02:51:27.040
It's very fun.

02:51:36.040 --> 02:51:39.040
You know, I used to be scared of the dark, Azura.

02:51:39.040 --> 02:51:42.040
Me too! I used to be terrified of the dark!

02:51:42.040 --> 02:51:48.040
I'll tell you, I had some family members who were like big old jerks.

02:51:48.040 --> 02:51:50.040
Bullies, really.

02:51:50.040 --> 02:51:53.040
They used to lock me in a closet when I was younger.

02:51:53.040 --> 02:51:59.040
They'd lock me in a closet and let me out for like 30 minutes to an hour.

02:51:59.040 --> 02:52:03.040
And I grew a big fear of the dark ever since then.

02:52:03.040 --> 02:52:08.040
They always made fun of me for being scared of the dark as I got older.

02:52:08.040 --> 02:52:12.040
But I mean, it's your fault.

02:52:12.040 --> 02:52:14.040
It's literally your fault.

02:52:14.040 --> 02:52:17.040
I was scared of the dark for a long, long time.

02:52:17.040 --> 02:52:20.040
I'm only literally now getting used to it.

02:52:20.040 --> 02:52:22.040
And I'm so old.

02:52:24.040 --> 02:52:26.040
I'm so old.

02:52:26.040 --> 02:52:28.040
I used to sleep with a TV on.

02:52:28.040 --> 02:52:34.040
It's the only way I can sleep, either with a fan or some little night lights.

02:52:34.040 --> 02:52:36.040
I have like a couple of night lights in my room.

02:52:36.040 --> 02:52:42.040
I have a light that turns like rainbow-y colors, like all the colors of the rainbow.

02:52:42.040 --> 02:52:47.040
And I have a couple of lights on the other side of my room, too.

02:52:51.040 --> 02:52:57.040
So yeah, it's really hard for me to sleep at night, even until this day.

02:53:05.040 --> 02:53:07.040
I'm worried so you don't worry about it.

02:53:07.040 --> 02:53:09.040
I'm worried.

02:53:09.040 --> 02:53:11.040
I'm fine.

02:53:11.040 --> 02:53:15.040
There literally is no need.

02:53:15.040 --> 02:53:19.040
I don't want anyone to feel worried about me, okay?

02:53:19.040 --> 02:53:21.040
Okay?

02:53:21.040 --> 02:53:23.040
I'm okay.

02:53:26.040 --> 02:53:30.040
It's a little hard to imagine that now.

02:53:30.040 --> 02:53:33.040
After spending so much time here.

02:53:34.040 --> 02:53:39.040
But not long ago, I couldn't even go to sleep without a lamp.

02:53:39.040 --> 02:53:41.040
I still can't.

02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:45.040
Me, too.

02:53:51.040 --> 02:53:53.040
Really?

02:53:53.040 --> 02:53:57.040
Even though you're a god, gods have fears, too.

02:53:57.040 --> 02:53:59.040
Goddesses have fears, too.

02:54:03.040 --> 02:54:06.040
Yeah, I see it.

02:54:06.040 --> 02:54:10.040
Oh, but it's a good thing I got over that fear.

02:54:10.040 --> 02:54:14.040
Otherwise, I wouldn't last long here.

02:54:14.040 --> 02:54:18.040
And again, I've been carrying around the sun.

02:54:18.040 --> 02:54:20.040
That's not too bad.

02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:23.040
Thanks, Nico more brave than me.

02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:29.040
Also, I don't feel scared at all with you guiding me.

02:54:29.040 --> 02:54:32.040
So, thanks for that.

02:54:32.040 --> 02:54:34.040
He's so cute.

02:54:34.040 --> 02:54:36.040
Oh my god.

02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:39.040
Oh my god, did you see a little cat smiley there?

02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:41.040
So cute.

02:54:54.040 --> 02:54:58.040
Anyway, maybe we should head out now, Zara.

02:54:58.040 --> 02:55:04.040
How big fear gods have, gods and goddesses definitely have?

02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:10.040
The fear of loneliness, the fear of being alone.

02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:16.040
You live basically forever.

02:55:17.040 --> 02:55:25.040
And then, all of a sudden, everyone around you is gone.

02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:33.040
It's lonely. It's very lonely.

02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:52.040
And that's why I have you guys.

02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:55.040
We will quail each other's loneliness.

02:55:58.040 --> 02:56:02.040
Yeah, yeah.

02:56:28.040 --> 02:56:31.040
All right.

02:56:52.040 --> 02:56:54.040
It's like a fear.

02:56:54.040 --> 02:56:56.040
Everyone's big fear.

02:56:56.040 --> 02:57:09.040
And that's why it's easier for a god or a goddess to understand how that one emotion feels to a full extent.

02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:20.040
You're not alone. I can relate.

02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:24.040
Being the only one left after struggling for so long

02:57:25.040 --> 02:57:33.040
Is I'm just a lonely soul. Relatable. I understand how you feel.

02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:40.040
Watch your lore. I away hold forever. Never let go. Never let go.

02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:44.040
How sweet. I appreciate that.

02:57:45.040 --> 02:57:55.040
I found a pen. Sort of. Good. Please write your name here.

02:58:01.040 --> 02:58:02.040
Good luck.

02:58:03.040 --> 02:58:13.040
I like the little jingle. It's cute. It's very cute. Cute jingle.

02:58:13.040 --> 02:58:18.040
Is there anything else I'm supposed to do here? I feel like I'm forgetting something.

02:58:32.040 --> 02:58:34.040
What in the world?

02:58:56.040 --> 02:58:58.040
It's squares.

02:59:02.040 --> 02:59:17.040
It's medication time. I have to take my medication real fast.

02:59:17.040 --> 02:59:19.040
We're in a new location.

02:59:19.040 --> 02:59:32.040
I want to finish the game.

02:59:32.040 --> 02:59:42.040
In another hour, I'll take them.

02:59:42.040 --> 02:59:46.040
I'll take them. I'll take the medication.

02:59:46.040 --> 02:59:48.040
In another hour.

02:59:50.040 --> 02:59:55.040
If I take them now, it'll put me to sleep. I don't want to go to sleep.

02:59:55.040 --> 02:59:59.040
I'm fixating now.

02:59:59.040 --> 03:00:01.040
In another hour, I'll take them.

03:00:07.040 --> 03:00:10.040
Want us to remind you? Sure. You can do that.

03:00:10.040 --> 03:00:12.040
I'd appreciate that.

03:00:16.040 --> 03:00:20.040
The sun. Hello, Messiah. Welcome to the refuge.

03:00:20.040 --> 03:00:24.040
Do you understand what you must do here?

03:00:24.040 --> 03:00:27.040
I'm supposed to go inside the tower, right?

03:00:27.040 --> 03:00:34.040
I already see the tower, so I guess we must be close to the entrance on the surface.

03:00:34.040 --> 03:00:37.040
The surface? Look down, small one.

03:00:37.040 --> 03:00:39.040
Oh, we're pretty high up.

03:00:39.040 --> 03:00:43.040
I guess I gotta get down a lot of stairs.

03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:45.040
I'll find an elevator. Correct.

03:00:45.040 --> 03:00:48.040
However, the tower is a sacred place.

03:00:48.040 --> 03:00:53.040
Finding the entrance may be easy, but that alone will not be enough.

03:00:53.040 --> 03:00:55.040
What do you mean?

03:00:55.040 --> 03:01:02.040
Once you reach the surface, I recommend visiting the library for leads.

03:01:02.040 --> 03:01:04.040
Alright, thank you.

03:01:04.040 --> 03:01:06.040
Off you go then.

03:01:06.040 --> 03:01:09.040
I'm afraid this area is off limits for you.

03:01:09.040 --> 03:01:18.040
Only the bearer of the sacred kernel is permitted to access the garden.

03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:24.040
Sacred kernel? Have a kernel.

03:01:30.040 --> 03:01:34.040
Oh, like kernel corn? Have this.

03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:38.040
It was left behind by the plant lady in the glen.

03:01:39.040 --> 03:01:41.040
This is indeed the kernel.

03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:44.040
Then it is your duty to regrow her.

03:01:44.040 --> 03:01:46.040
Do you understand what you must do?

03:01:46.040 --> 03:01:49.040
Um, yep, good.

03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:53.040
We may now pass through to access the garden.

03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:55.040
Weee!

03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:15.040
I'm about to see it in the planter.

03:02:15.040 --> 03:02:21.040
There's no dirt in this pot. Will the seed really grow like this?

03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:27.040
Do I need dirt?

03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:34.040
I gotta get dirt.

03:02:40.040 --> 03:02:43.040
It's the shape of the light bulb.

03:02:46.040 --> 03:02:48.040
We gotta get dirt.

03:02:48.040 --> 03:03:17.040
I agree. I also, I am, being alone has its ups and downs, whether it is the quiet.

03:03:17.040 --> 03:03:19.040
I really like my solitude.

03:03:19.040 --> 03:03:21.040
I really do.

03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:33.040
That didn't scare me. I wasn't scared once.

03:03:33.040 --> 03:03:35.040
That didn't scare me at all.

03:03:35.040 --> 03:03:38.040
Come on!

03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:41.040
Come on!

03:03:41.040 --> 03:03:43.040
Work already!

03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:45.040
What was that?

03:03:45.040 --> 03:03:47.040
I really do like my solitude.

03:03:47.040 --> 03:03:50.040
I like spending time to myself sometimes.

03:03:50.040 --> 03:04:00.040
But you really do hate when it's like really, really, really quiet.

03:04:00.040 --> 03:04:05.040
You miss the noise that surrounds it and stuff.

03:04:07.040 --> 03:04:10.040
I don't hate it when I'm like with someone.

03:04:11.040 --> 03:04:23.040
It's more like when being talked to when you're like enjoying your solitude.

03:04:23.040 --> 03:04:28.040
You know, like when you're like watching anime and someone starts talking to you.

03:04:28.040 --> 03:04:31.040
Doesn't that not bother you?

03:04:31.040 --> 03:04:34.040
Come on! Come on!

03:04:34.040 --> 03:04:36.040
I'm too busy for this.

03:04:36.040 --> 03:04:38.040
Excuse me?

03:04:38.040 --> 03:04:42.040
Whoa, you are you?

03:04:42.040 --> 03:04:47.040
Oh jeez, I didn't think I was gonna run into.

03:04:47.040 --> 03:04:49.040
This is embarrassing.

03:04:49.040 --> 03:04:53.040
Er, is there anything I can help you with?

03:04:53.040 --> 03:04:55.040
Yes please.

03:04:55.040 --> 03:04:58.040
I would like to know how to get to the surface.

03:04:58.040 --> 03:05:02.040
Yeah, I was afraid you were gonna say that.

03:05:02.040 --> 03:05:06.040
Right now, this elevator is the only way to access the surface.

03:05:06.040 --> 03:05:11.040
But yeah, just take a look at it.

03:05:11.040 --> 03:05:14.040
It looks like an elevator.

03:05:14.040 --> 03:05:22.040
Oh, you're not wrong, but go look at the button panel.

03:05:22.040 --> 03:05:23.040
Huh?

03:05:23.040 --> 03:05:25.040
There aren't any buttons.

03:05:25.040 --> 03:05:29.040
Yup, that's a problem.

03:05:29.040 --> 03:05:36.040
There's really a big button here that says ground on it.

03:05:36.040 --> 03:05:39.040
You know, cause it takes you to the ground area.

03:05:39.040 --> 03:05:42.040
Now it's been ripped out or something.

03:05:42.040 --> 03:05:46.040
I tried looking everywhere for it to no avail.

03:05:46.040 --> 03:05:49.040
Maybe it exploded?

03:05:49.040 --> 03:05:52.040
Do you think we'll have to make a new one?

03:05:52.040 --> 03:05:53.040
What?

03:05:53.040 --> 03:05:54.040
How?

03:05:54.040 --> 03:05:57.040
We'll figure it out.

03:05:57.040 --> 03:06:00.040
Do you think we'll be able to make that button?

03:06:00.040 --> 03:06:02.040
Well, no pressure kid.

03:06:02.040 --> 03:06:05.040
I'll just stick with my original plan for now.

03:06:05.040 --> 03:06:10.040
Time to kick the door again.

03:06:10.040 --> 03:06:15.040
My foot hurts.

03:06:15.040 --> 03:06:17.040
Silly Billy.

03:06:17.040 --> 03:06:18.040
Okay.

03:06:18.040 --> 03:06:20.040
They always say go left.

03:06:20.040 --> 03:06:22.040
Oh.

03:06:22.040 --> 03:06:27.040
Well, that's nothing there.

03:06:27.040 --> 03:06:30.040
What's the bed?

03:06:30.040 --> 03:06:37.040
We don't need that yet.

03:06:37.040 --> 03:06:39.040
Oh, there's squares.

03:06:39.040 --> 03:06:50.040
There's squares again.

03:06:50.040 --> 03:06:53.040
You think you can clear the last two areas tonight?

03:06:53.040 --> 03:06:54.040
Yeah.

03:06:54.040 --> 03:06:56.040
We're gonna play for a while tonight.

03:06:56.040 --> 03:06:58.040
I'm feeling up to it.

03:06:58.040 --> 03:07:04.040
You know?

03:07:04.040 --> 03:07:06.040
It is a Friday.

03:07:06.040 --> 03:07:09.040
So I wanna enjoy a Friday night.

03:07:09.040 --> 03:07:24.040
Being a noiseless house disturbs me.

03:07:24.040 --> 03:07:26.040
But I can't stand loud noises.

03:07:26.040 --> 03:07:27.040
Me too.

03:07:27.040 --> 03:07:31.040
Actually, I agree.

03:07:31.040 --> 03:07:32.040
Have fun learning.

03:07:32.040 --> 03:07:34.040
Last time for me to go to sleep.

03:07:34.040 --> 03:07:36.040
I'll have a good night.

03:07:36.040 --> 03:07:38.040
Sweet dreams.

03:07:38.040 --> 03:07:40.040
Good night.

03:07:40.040 --> 03:07:52.040
Night night.

03:07:52.040 --> 03:07:55.040
Wow.

03:07:55.040 --> 03:07:57.040
This tells me go that way.

03:07:57.040 --> 03:08:00.040
This says go down.

03:08:00.040 --> 03:08:07.040
Sweet squares.

03:08:07.040 --> 03:08:10.520
laboratories  Meghan

03:08:37.040 --> 03:08:40.040
because the ground access elevator is broken

03:08:40.360 --> 03:08:41.760
so I've been told

03:08:42.280 --> 03:08:46.640
the city's infrastructure has been suffering a lot lately

03:08:47.280 --> 03:08:50.560
skywalks and stairs breaking off left and right

03:08:51.040 --> 03:08:55.040
now the only reliable way of transport of those elevators

03:08:55.160 --> 03:08:57.120
until now anyway

03:08:58.720 --> 03:09:00.040
milk and sugar

03:09:00.040 --> 03:09:01.040
I like both

03:09:01.040 --> 03:09:02.040
me too

03:09:02.040 --> 03:09:03.640
but not in coffee

03:09:04.640 --> 03:09:07.640
I like it in coffee

03:09:09.640 --> 03:09:10.640
a lot of it

03:09:10.640 --> 03:09:12.640
add a lot of it in coffee

03:09:13.640 --> 03:09:14.640
coffee machine

03:09:14.640 --> 03:09:15.640
nearly full

03:09:19.640 --> 03:09:22.640
you know that's all guy came in here earlier

03:09:22.640 --> 03:09:23.640
same the same thing

03:09:24.640 --> 03:09:26.640
he asked me if I've seen a button that says ground on it

03:09:27.640 --> 03:09:29.640
looked pretty stressed

03:09:29.640 --> 03:09:31.640
so I wanted to cheer him up

03:09:31.640 --> 03:09:33.640
until I'm not only ground

03:09:33.640 --> 03:09:36.640
I've seen today's coffee grounds

03:09:52.640 --> 03:09:54.640
I thought she was angry

03:09:54.640 --> 03:09:56.640
I would be too

03:09:58.640 --> 03:09:59.640
he didn't get it

03:10:02.640 --> 03:10:03.640
shh

03:10:06.640 --> 03:10:08.640
I see him around a lot

03:10:08.640 --> 03:10:11.640
but never seems to have time to get a proper meal

03:10:12.640 --> 03:10:14.640
he kind of just rushes in here

03:10:14.640 --> 03:10:16.640
drinks a whole pot of coffee

03:10:16.640 --> 03:10:18.640
and then rushes by out

03:10:18.640 --> 03:10:19.640
yeah

03:10:19.640 --> 03:10:20.640
he really like

03:10:20.640 --> 03:10:23.640
he really takes his job to the extreme

03:10:24.640 --> 03:10:26.640
I mean it's an important job

03:10:26.640 --> 03:10:28.640
but nothing is worth

03:10:28.640 --> 03:10:30.640
that amount of stress I think

03:10:30.640 --> 03:10:32.640
what does he do?

03:10:32.640 --> 03:10:34.640
maintenance I believe

03:10:34.640 --> 03:10:36.640
something to do with the lights

03:10:36.640 --> 03:10:38.640
but I don't know the details

03:10:38.640 --> 03:10:40.640
maybe he can ask me later

03:10:40.640 --> 03:10:41.640
oh

03:10:41.640 --> 03:10:42.640
you're still here

03:10:42.640 --> 03:10:43.640
would you

03:10:45.640 --> 03:10:46.640
like something?

03:10:46.640 --> 03:10:47.640
anything?

03:10:47.640 --> 03:10:49.640
I can cook something for you if you want

03:10:49.640 --> 03:10:51.640
sorry thank you

03:10:53.640 --> 03:10:55.640
I am right here

03:11:01.640 --> 03:11:04.640
okay so I can't go anywhere in there

03:11:09.640 --> 03:11:11.640
was there like an area I missed or something?

03:11:11.640 --> 03:11:12.640
over here

03:11:22.640 --> 03:11:24.640
I'm like probably

03:11:27.640 --> 03:11:28.640
good evening

03:11:29.640 --> 03:11:30.640
well

03:11:30.640 --> 03:11:32.640
the time of day doesn't really mean anything now

03:11:33.640 --> 03:11:35.640
when the sun's gone

03:11:35.640 --> 03:11:37.640
with the sun gone

03:11:37.640 --> 03:11:39.640
the night never seems to end

03:11:40.640 --> 03:11:42.640
well then

03:11:42.640 --> 03:11:43.640
how can you tell?

03:11:43.640 --> 03:11:44.640
time

03:11:44.640 --> 03:11:45.640
I mean

03:11:45.640 --> 03:11:47.640
I have my ways

03:11:47.640 --> 03:11:50.640
because she's a giant walking clock

03:11:51.640 --> 03:11:54.640
there they are a giant walking clock

03:11:55.640 --> 03:11:57.640
there they are

03:11:57.640 --> 03:11:59.640
time is precious

03:11:59.640 --> 03:12:01.640
please cherish it

03:12:01.640 --> 03:12:03.640
I will

03:12:07.640 --> 03:12:09.640
they are just

03:12:09.640 --> 03:12:11.640
bolted so people

03:12:11.640 --> 03:12:14.640
they just bolted so people won't steal them

03:12:14.640 --> 03:12:17.640
they're just bolted so people won't steal them

03:12:17.640 --> 03:12:19.640
feel free to use them

03:12:20.640 --> 03:12:22.640
a tape dispenser

03:12:23.640 --> 03:12:26.640
it's bolted to the table

03:12:26.640 --> 03:12:29.640
oh my god I can't say the word bolted

03:12:30.640 --> 03:12:32.640
why is it so hard?

03:12:36.640 --> 03:12:38.640
a stapler

03:12:40.640 --> 03:12:42.640
some kind of computer terminal

03:12:43.640 --> 03:12:46.640
I am the power room mechanic

03:12:46.640 --> 03:12:48.640
do you have an issue to report?

03:12:48.640 --> 03:12:50.640
yeah actually

03:12:50.640 --> 03:12:52.640
surface axis elevator appears to be broken

03:12:52.640 --> 03:12:54.640
there's a button missing then

03:12:54.640 --> 03:12:56.640
can you take a look?

03:12:56.640 --> 03:12:59.640
leaving this room is not in my programming

03:12:59.640 --> 03:13:01.640
I don't know

03:13:10.640 --> 03:13:12.640
nah I don't like the music change

03:13:12.640 --> 03:13:14.640
all of this button

03:13:14.640 --> 03:13:16.640
I don't like this

03:13:17.640 --> 03:13:19.640
computer

03:13:22.640 --> 03:13:25.640
you're gonna need this soon

03:13:25.640 --> 03:13:27.640
take this phone

03:13:27.640 --> 03:13:29.640
and expose it to the void

03:13:29.640 --> 03:13:32.640
the answer will be revealed when you bring it back again

03:13:33.640 --> 03:13:36.640
the computer printed out a strange transparent sheet

03:13:42.640 --> 03:13:44.640
still clueless

03:13:44.640 --> 03:13:46.640
pick yours

03:13:58.640 --> 03:14:01.640
where have my sense of humor gone?

03:14:01.640 --> 03:14:04.640
why is that so funny to me?

03:14:15.640 --> 03:14:18.640
did I make a weird film?

03:14:23.640 --> 03:14:25.640
why is this happening?

03:14:25.640 --> 03:14:27.640
because I'm hearing the goddess right now

03:14:36.640 --> 03:14:39.640
it shouldn't be so funny but it is

03:14:40.640 --> 03:14:42.640
a heavy piece of metal

03:14:42.640 --> 03:14:44.640
sat into the wall

03:14:44.640 --> 03:14:47.640
I think it might be a door or some kind of a

03:14:47.640 --> 03:14:49.640
small screen here though

03:15:01.640 --> 03:15:03.640
hello

03:15:10.640 --> 03:15:12.640
wow

03:15:13.640 --> 03:15:16.640
I've actually never been to the big city before

03:15:16.640 --> 03:15:18.640
all these lights

03:15:19.640 --> 03:15:21.640
all these people

03:15:22.640 --> 03:15:26.640
I guess most of this world's population live here

03:15:40.640 --> 03:15:43.640
I'm sorry it's the way he turns a look at me

03:15:52.640 --> 03:15:55.640
it's very different from my village

03:15:55.640 --> 03:15:57.640
the village is very small

03:15:57.640 --> 03:15:59.640
surrounded by huge fields

03:15:59.640 --> 03:16:01.640
saw a bit of it

03:16:01.640 --> 03:16:04.640
in one of my dreams from a while ago

03:16:04.640 --> 03:16:06.640
the tallest building in the world

03:16:07.640 --> 03:16:10.640
the tallest buildings in our village

03:16:10.640 --> 03:16:13.640
are only two stories tall

03:16:24.640 --> 03:16:26.640
what about you Zara?

03:16:26.640 --> 03:16:28.640
what do you love?

03:16:32.640 --> 03:16:34.640
a city

03:16:34.640 --> 03:16:36.640
a city like this?

03:16:36.640 --> 03:16:38.640
wow

03:16:38.640 --> 03:16:41.640
kind of mad and living in a city

03:16:43.640 --> 03:16:45.640
must be exciting

03:16:47.640 --> 03:16:49.640
get me out

03:16:49.640 --> 03:16:51.640
get me out

03:16:51.640 --> 03:16:53.640
get me out

03:16:57.640 --> 03:16:59.640
get me out

03:16:59.640 --> 03:17:02.640
you wanna be here no more

03:17:02.640 --> 03:17:04.640
get me out

03:17:04.640 --> 03:17:06.640
help me

03:17:06.640 --> 03:17:08.640
help me

03:17:20.640 --> 03:17:22.640
kind of scary

03:17:27.640 --> 03:17:29.640
the view is nice though

03:17:33.640 --> 03:17:35.640
I'm so tired

03:17:54.640 --> 03:17:56.640
wait

03:17:56.640 --> 03:17:58.640
wait

03:18:02.640 --> 03:18:04.640
wait

03:18:10.640 --> 03:18:12.640
is this a circle?

03:18:12.640 --> 03:18:14.640
did I walk in a circle?

03:18:15.640 --> 03:18:17.640
did I walk in a circle?

03:18:26.640 --> 03:18:29.640
was this just a giant circle?

03:18:30.640 --> 03:18:33.640
I'm so confused

03:18:48.640 --> 03:18:50.640
was it a circle?

03:18:52.640 --> 03:18:54.640
I don't understand

03:18:54.640 --> 03:18:56.640
now let me go back up

03:18:56.640 --> 03:18:58.640
let me go

03:18:59.640 --> 03:19:01.640
let me go

03:19:01.640 --> 03:19:03.640
let me go

03:19:03.640 --> 03:19:07.640
I was just a big massive circle

03:19:07.640 --> 03:19:10.640
you don't need to be in here

03:19:11.640 --> 03:19:14.640
the thingy gave me something

03:19:14.640 --> 03:19:17.640
it's a lot I'm gonna need it later

03:19:20.640 --> 03:19:22.640
let it give me

03:19:29.640 --> 03:19:31.640
let it give me

03:19:54.640 --> 03:19:57.640
I'm looking at my files right now

03:19:57.640 --> 03:19:59.640
looking in there

03:19:59.640 --> 03:20:01.640
let's see what it is

03:20:01.640 --> 03:20:03.640
blinded

03:20:03.640 --> 03:20:05.640
flashbang

03:20:11.640 --> 03:20:13.640
let me see

03:20:14.640 --> 03:20:16.640
what are you giving me

03:20:16.640 --> 03:20:18.640
what is it giving me

03:20:18.640 --> 03:20:20.640
tell the hero take this

03:20:20.640 --> 03:20:23.640
oh it gave me the paper

03:20:23.640 --> 03:20:25.640
the transparent paper

03:20:27.640 --> 03:20:29.640
the paper

03:20:29.640 --> 03:20:31.640
I forgot

03:20:31.640 --> 03:20:33.640
sorry

03:20:33.640 --> 03:20:35.640
slow

03:20:41.640 --> 03:20:45.640
how do I take the thingy off the desk

03:20:57.640 --> 03:20:59.640
what is this

03:21:01.640 --> 03:21:03.640
we didn't even do it this

03:21:27.640 --> 03:21:29.640
I'm so confused

03:21:35.640 --> 03:21:37.640
I'm so confused

03:21:39.640 --> 03:21:41.640
is there something film related?

03:21:43.640 --> 03:21:45.640
it's a lot of numbers

03:21:49.640 --> 03:21:51.640
what about with this

03:21:53.640 --> 03:21:55.640
a new journal

03:21:57.640 --> 03:21:59.640
I don't know

03:22:05.640 --> 03:22:07.640
there's nothing in there

03:22:13.640 --> 03:22:15.640
I think over here was the last

03:22:27.640 --> 03:22:29.640
it's locked

03:22:33.640 --> 03:22:35.640
it's locked

03:22:35.640 --> 03:22:37.640
it's locked

03:22:41.640 --> 03:22:43.640
landscape painting

03:22:45.640 --> 03:22:47.640
an abstract painting

03:22:49.640 --> 03:22:51.640
are you an intruder?

03:22:51.640 --> 03:22:53.640
because if you are

03:22:53.640 --> 03:22:55.640
I model 8

03:22:55.640 --> 03:22:57.640
home security bot

03:22:57.640 --> 03:22:59.640
tm serial number

03:22:59.640 --> 03:23:01.640
39232883904

03:23:03.640 --> 03:23:05.640
will have to report you

03:23:05.640 --> 03:23:07.640
oh sorry

03:23:07.640 --> 03:23:09.640
I cannot just walk in because the door was unlocked

03:23:09.640 --> 03:23:11.640
do you want me to leave

03:23:11.640 --> 03:23:13.640
scanning for suspicious activity

03:23:13.640 --> 03:23:15.640
suspicious activity

03:23:15.640 --> 03:23:17.640
suspicious activity

03:23:17.640 --> 03:23:19.640
why I stuttered so hard

03:23:19.640 --> 03:23:21.640
suspicious activity detected zero

03:23:21.640 --> 03:23:23.640
guess as long as I don't do anything bad

03:23:25.640 --> 03:23:27.640
it's off

03:23:31.640 --> 03:23:33.640
is there a small lives here

03:23:33.640 --> 03:23:35.640
we can't just sleep in their bed

03:23:35.640 --> 03:23:37.640
why not

03:23:39.640 --> 03:23:41.640
looks comfy

03:23:49.640 --> 03:23:51.640
all family photos

03:23:51.640 --> 03:23:53.640
hello there

03:23:53.640 --> 03:23:55.640

03:24:03.640 --> 03:24:05.640

03:24:05.640 --> 03:24:07.640
you like feather

03:24:07.640 --> 03:24:09.640
feather

03:24:17.640 --> 03:24:19.640
big penguin plush

03:24:23.640 --> 03:24:25.640
I

03:24:27.640 --> 03:24:29.640
did not like that scared

03:24:29.640 --> 03:24:31.640
that scared me so bad

03:24:31.640 --> 03:24:33.640
oh my god

03:24:35.640 --> 03:24:37.640
oh my

03:24:43.640 --> 03:24:45.640
baby jump out of my chair

03:24:45.640 --> 03:24:47.640
baby jump

03:24:47.640 --> 03:24:49.640
oh my god

03:24:53.640 --> 03:24:55.640
oh my god

03:24:55.640 --> 03:24:57.640
oh my god

03:25:01.640 --> 03:25:03.640
oh that was so scary

03:25:13.640 --> 03:25:15.640
I don't think I'll space

03:25:23.640 --> 03:25:25.640
I

03:25:31.640 --> 03:25:33.640
wait

03:25:33.640 --> 03:25:35.640
they are the penguin

03:25:35.640 --> 03:25:37.640
look

03:25:37.640 --> 03:25:39.640
no I guess not

03:25:39.640 --> 03:25:41.640
it's a pink flower

03:25:47.640 --> 03:25:49.640
pink flower

03:25:49.640 --> 03:25:51.640
so

03:25:51.640 --> 03:25:53.640
these houses are so empty

03:25:53.640 --> 03:25:55.640
so depressing

03:25:55.640 --> 03:25:57.640
it's like nothing else in there

03:26:01.640 --> 03:26:03.640
pictures of many ones and zero

03:26:03.640 --> 03:26:05.640
finding a four robot

03:26:05.640 --> 03:26:07.640
playing cards

03:26:07.640 --> 03:26:09.640
hello

03:26:09.640 --> 03:26:11.640
do you like to play a game

03:26:11.640 --> 03:26:13.640

03:26:13.640 --> 03:26:15.640
do you know rock paper scissors

03:26:15.640 --> 03:26:17.640
it's a higher difficulty level

03:26:17.640 --> 03:26:19.640
hmm

03:26:19.640 --> 03:26:21.640
desired duration of turns

03:26:21.640 --> 03:26:23.640
please save your timer

03:26:23.640 --> 03:26:25.640
don't mind

03:26:27.640 --> 03:26:29.640
my parents are like

03:26:29.640 --> 03:26:31.640
literally never home

03:26:31.640 --> 03:26:33.640
and

03:26:33.640 --> 03:26:35.640
my parents are like

03:26:35.640 --> 03:26:37.640
literally never home

03:26:37.640 --> 03:26:39.640
but I don't mind

03:26:39.640 --> 03:26:41.640
I'm used to it

03:26:41.640 --> 03:26:43.640
besides

03:26:43.640 --> 03:26:45.640
I've got models cw2

03:26:45.640 --> 03:26:47.640
2nd gen

03:26:47.640 --> 03:26:49.640
unit 4e here

03:26:49.640 --> 03:26:51.640
to keep me company now

03:26:51.640 --> 03:26:53.640
she still talks a little weird sometimes

03:26:53.640 --> 03:26:55.640
but that's okay

03:26:55.640 --> 03:26:57.640
she's learning

03:26:57.640 --> 03:26:59.640
if I work real hard

03:26:59.640 --> 03:27:01.640
she might even be tamed someday

03:27:03.640 --> 03:27:05.640
I keep hearing that word

03:27:05.640 --> 03:27:07.640
what tamed

03:27:09.640 --> 03:27:11.640
nobody's told me what it means

03:27:11.640 --> 03:27:13.640
yeah

03:27:13.640 --> 03:27:15.640
that's just a robot thing

03:27:15.640 --> 03:27:17.640
oh I didn't even read it

03:27:17.640 --> 03:27:19.640
I can't really

03:27:19.640 --> 03:27:21.640
something

03:27:23.640 --> 03:27:25.640
nope

03:27:25.640 --> 03:27:27.640
nope

03:27:27.640 --> 03:27:29.640
nope

03:27:29.640 --> 03:27:31.640
nope

03:27:31.640 --> 03:27:33.640
can't really explain it either

03:27:33.640 --> 03:27:35.640
while of large books

03:27:35.640 --> 03:27:37.640
one of them is a robot instruction manual

03:27:37.640 --> 03:27:39.640
it's off

03:27:41.640 --> 03:27:43.640
right right here

03:27:43.640 --> 03:27:45.640
there

03:27:45.640 --> 03:27:47.640
there

03:27:47.640 --> 03:27:49.640
another one

03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:53.640
picture of a ram

03:27:53.640 --> 03:27:55.640
wearing a little pink bow

03:27:55.640 --> 03:27:57.640
it's a landscape portrait of the glen

03:28:01.640 --> 03:28:03.640
something has been chewing on this plant

03:28:03.640 --> 03:28:05.640
it's the ram

03:28:05.640 --> 03:28:07.640
ram

03:28:07.640 --> 03:28:09.640
ram

03:28:09.640 --> 03:28:11.640
ram

03:28:11.640 --> 03:28:13.640
ram

03:28:13.640 --> 03:28:15.640
ram

03:28:15.640 --> 03:28:17.640
more books

03:28:17.640 --> 03:28:19.640
this city life

03:28:19.640 --> 03:28:21.640
what to expect

03:28:21.640 --> 03:28:23.640
I just moved here from the glen

03:28:23.640 --> 03:28:25.640
it's so different in the city

03:28:25.640 --> 03:28:27.640
you went to the glen right?

03:28:27.640 --> 03:28:29.640
yeah

03:28:29.640 --> 03:28:31.640
everything's so green back there

03:28:31.640 --> 03:28:33.640
I really miss it

03:28:33.640 --> 03:28:35.640
I already gave me some plants to cheer me up

03:28:35.640 --> 03:28:37.640
but

03:28:37.640 --> 03:28:39.640
I should probably get a muzzle

03:28:39.640 --> 03:28:41.640
for bestie here

03:28:41.640 --> 03:28:43.640
bestie

03:28:47.640 --> 03:28:49.640
how much of this plant

03:28:49.640 --> 03:28:51.640
nope

03:28:51.640 --> 03:28:53.640
just repeat

03:28:53.640 --> 03:28:55.640
usually they always have a second dialogue

03:28:55.640 --> 03:28:57.640
but sometimes they don't

03:28:57.640 --> 03:28:59.640
I like to check just in case

03:28:59.640 --> 03:29:01.640
hehe

03:29:01.640 --> 03:29:03.640

03:29:03.640 --> 03:29:05.640

03:29:05.640 --> 03:29:07.640
hehe

03:29:09.640 --> 03:29:11.640
can I sit on it?

03:29:11.640 --> 03:29:13.640
I'm not sure what this is

03:29:13.640 --> 03:29:15.640
it's like a little car

03:29:15.640 --> 03:29:17.640
you should write on it

03:29:19.640 --> 03:29:21.640
what?

03:29:21.640 --> 03:29:23.640
do it

03:29:23.640 --> 03:29:25.640
home

03:29:25.640 --> 03:29:27.640
hahahah

03:31:36.680 --> 03:31:40.680
there was a word missing from that

03:31:40.680 --> 03:31:48.680
i'm like a copium

03:31:48.680 --> 03:31:54.680
no copium here i don't even know that means

We got these growing lambs.

03:32:44.680 --> 03:32:48.680
But they are a poor substitute for the sun.

03:32:54.680 --> 03:32:56.680
This tree has leaves.

03:32:56.680 --> 03:32:58.680
Ah yes, true.

03:32:58.680 --> 03:33:02.680
Bully is just hard to come by nowadays.

03:33:02.680 --> 03:33:08.680
You hardly ever see trees like these in the wild anymore.

03:33:08.680 --> 03:33:16.680
And the ones you do see are pretty much all raised artificially by people like me.

03:33:16.680 --> 03:33:20.680
Mostly for nostalgia purposes.

03:33:26.680 --> 03:33:28.680
It's sweet.

03:33:30.680 --> 03:33:32.680
Why is it in a flower pot?

03:33:32.680 --> 03:33:35.680
Well, doesn't it look nice?

03:33:35.680 --> 03:33:37.680
I guess.

03:33:39.680 --> 03:33:43.680
I like to stand in the middle of the wheat fields back in my village.

03:33:43.680 --> 03:33:45.680
It goes on for miles.

03:33:45.680 --> 03:33:48.680
Ah, I wish I could have seen it.

03:33:48.680 --> 03:33:54.680
In our world, meat is usually only grown in small isolated pots.

03:33:54.680 --> 03:33:57.680
Or in a flower pot.

03:33:59.680 --> 03:34:01.680
There's a phosphor tree.

03:34:01.680 --> 03:34:05.680
Oh, like the ones we saw in the Glen.

03:34:06.680 --> 03:34:08.680
Where are the leaves?

03:34:08.680 --> 03:34:10.680
They're not dead, are they?

03:34:10.680 --> 03:34:12.680
Oh, not at all.

03:34:12.680 --> 03:34:19.680
Although these trees are common, composed of woody tissue, they are closer to grass.

03:34:19.680 --> 03:34:22.680
Anonymy-wise.

03:34:22.680 --> 03:34:25.680
So the branches are actually leaves?

03:34:25.680 --> 03:34:27.680
Sort of.

03:34:27.680 --> 03:34:33.680
What is interesting about these plants is the amount of phosphorus they generate.

03:34:33.680 --> 03:34:35.680
Zero before dinner?

03:34:35.680 --> 03:34:36.680
Yeah.

03:34:36.680 --> 03:34:38.680
I'm an adult!

03:34:56.680 --> 03:34:57.680
Phosphor.

03:34:57.680 --> 03:34:59.680
That's the glowy stuff, right?

03:34:59.680 --> 03:35:00.680
Yup.

03:35:00.680 --> 03:35:05.680
Phosphor can store light energy and slowly emit it over time.

03:35:10.680 --> 03:35:16.680
Most of the phosphorus from this world still contains energy from before the sun went out.

03:35:16.680 --> 03:35:18.680
Without the sun to recharge them though.

03:35:18.680 --> 03:35:21.680
Well, let's talk about something else.

03:35:31.680 --> 03:35:32.680
Hmm.

03:35:35.680 --> 03:35:38.680
A water again is half full.

03:35:41.680 --> 03:35:44.680
Built-up plant flippings.

03:35:44.680 --> 03:35:46.680
Like this, like this, like this.

03:35:46.680 --> 03:35:48.680
Like this, like this.

03:35:48.680 --> 03:35:50.680

03:37:41.340 --> 03:37:45.340
They could have saved it, saved those openings for later on.

03:37:47.340 --> 03:37:49.340
They could have saved it.

03:37:49.340 --> 03:37:52.340
They didn't have to make so many back to back to back.

03:38:00.340 --> 03:38:02.340
Couldn't get into black over.

03:38:04.340 --> 03:38:07.340
The power system was a bit weird to understand.

03:38:07.340 --> 03:38:12.340
They eventually explained it to you in better detail further into the anime.

03:38:12.340 --> 03:38:21.340
But it's meant to confuse you because even to the regular like even to the emcee it was confusing.

03:38:21.340 --> 03:38:27.340
So it was like meant to kind of confuse you like what's going on.

03:38:27.340 --> 03:38:35.340
Like this is dumb whatever this hierarchy stuff is dumb and it makes you agree with the emcee.

03:38:36.340 --> 03:38:39.340
So yeah, it was silly.

03:38:40.340 --> 03:38:44.340
But then they eventually explain it properly over time.

03:38:45.340 --> 03:38:51.340
Probably don't only plant hard enough to survive naturally outside the glenn.

03:38:53.340 --> 03:39:00.340
Personally, I think they're really born look at one of my customers really loves them though.

03:39:01.340 --> 03:39:05.340
I think all of the black clovers I'm growing here are for him actually.

03:39:05.340 --> 03:39:07.340
And I think of it.

03:39:07.340 --> 03:39:09.340
Haven't seen him in a while.

03:39:09.340 --> 03:39:11.340
Wonder when he's coming back.

03:39:12.340 --> 03:39:15.340
Coming to pick the mom these up.

03:39:18.340 --> 03:39:20.340
Hmm, it's a pink flower.

03:39:22.340 --> 03:39:24.340
Smoke garden tool.

03:39:24.340 --> 03:39:28.340
And the part shaped like an owl.

03:39:28.340 --> 03:39:30.340
I get it.

03:39:36.340 --> 03:39:38.340
I don't get it.

03:39:46.340 --> 03:39:48.340
I don't get it.

03:39:48.340 --> 03:39:50.340
I don't get it.

03:39:50.340 --> 03:39:52.340
I don't get it.

03:39:57.340 --> 03:39:59.340
A hoe?

03:39:59.340 --> 03:40:01.340
Is it because it's like a hoe?

03:40:01.340 --> 03:40:03.340
So it's like who who?

03:40:03.340 --> 03:40:05.340
A hoe?

03:40:05.340 --> 03:40:07.340
No, but it's not a hoe.

03:40:09.340 --> 03:40:11.340
That's not what you call it.

03:40:13.340 --> 03:40:15.340
Garden tool.

03:40:16.340 --> 03:40:18.340
Trowel.

03:40:39.340 --> 03:40:41.340
I knew that.

03:40:41.340 --> 03:40:43.340
I knew that.

03:40:44.340 --> 03:40:46.340
I knew that.

03:40:48.340 --> 03:40:49.340
Hello there.

03:40:49.340 --> 03:40:51.340
You have a lot of plants.

03:40:51.340 --> 03:40:52.340
A dune.

03:40:52.340 --> 03:40:54.340
All of these myself you see.

03:40:57.340 --> 03:40:59.340
Feel free to ask.

03:40:59.340 --> 03:41:01.340
Oh, you're a gardener right?

03:41:01.340 --> 03:41:05.340
Do you have any dirt for growing plants I mean?

03:41:05.340 --> 03:41:07.340
Yup, do you need some?

03:41:07.340 --> 03:41:08.340
Yes.

03:41:08.340 --> 03:41:12.340
I'm supposed to plant the seeds I find while I plant later.

03:41:13.340 --> 03:41:16.340
The pod in the garden doesn't have any soil.

03:41:16.340 --> 03:41:17.340
I see.

03:41:17.340 --> 03:41:19.340
I know what you're talking about.

03:41:19.340 --> 03:41:22.340
Here, take this whole bag.

03:41:22.340 --> 03:41:24.340
Thanks Mr. Plant person.

03:41:24.340 --> 03:41:26.340
I like your little bowl.

03:41:26.340 --> 03:41:29.340
Little bowl around your neck.

03:41:29.340 --> 03:41:32.340
Most of the plants in our world tend to grow in the plant.

03:41:32.340 --> 03:41:36.340
Even if it's facing the flooding issue.

03:41:36.340 --> 03:41:41.340
It's still in better condition than the other two areas.

03:41:41.340 --> 03:41:45.340
The barrens is, well, the barrens.

03:41:45.340 --> 03:41:50.340
And Refuge City has barely enough ground to stand on.

03:41:50.340 --> 03:41:52.340
Let alone grow still.

03:41:52.340 --> 03:41:56.340
On a larger scale like this, I mean.

03:41:56.340 --> 03:41:57.340
Is that it?

03:41:57.340 --> 03:41:59.340
Good luck with the seed now.

03:41:59.340 --> 03:42:01.340
Thank you, bye bye.

03:42:01.340 --> 03:42:15.340
Our stairs here.

03:42:15.340 --> 03:42:17.340
Coffee cups.

03:42:17.340 --> 03:42:19.340
I'm too young to drink coffee.

03:42:19.340 --> 03:42:21.340
Eh?

03:42:21.340 --> 03:42:22.340
The coffee machine.

03:42:22.340 --> 03:42:24.340
It's very warm.

03:42:24.340 --> 03:42:26.340
Are you really?

03:42:26.340 --> 03:42:27.340
What's the library?

03:42:27.340 --> 03:42:28.340
I love books.

03:42:28.340 --> 03:42:30.340
It looks like fun books.

03:42:34.340 --> 03:42:36.340
Dog ear?

03:42:36.340 --> 03:42:38.340
Dog ear.

03:42:38.340 --> 03:42:41.340
Yeah, I was just testing you.

03:42:41.340 --> 03:42:43.340
Just testing you guys.

03:42:43.340 --> 03:42:45.340
We're bleeding hearts.

03:42:45.340 --> 03:42:47.340
I was just testing you.

03:42:47.340 --> 03:42:49.340
Hey there.

03:42:49.340 --> 03:42:51.340
Hello.

03:42:51.340 --> 03:42:53.340
You the Messiah?

03:42:53.340 --> 03:42:56.340
I like your scarf.

03:42:56.340 --> 03:42:58.340
Thank you.

03:42:58.340 --> 03:43:00.340
Mama made it for me.

03:43:00.340 --> 03:43:02.340
Tell her I like her needlework.

03:43:02.340 --> 03:43:03.340
I will.

03:43:03.340 --> 03:43:05.340
When I see her again.

03:43:05.340 --> 03:43:06.340
Well.

03:43:12.340 --> 03:43:14.340
Okay.

03:43:14.340 --> 03:43:16.340
It's a kitchen.

03:43:16.340 --> 03:43:18.340
Oh, it's a fridge.

03:43:20.340 --> 03:43:22.340
A sink.

03:43:22.340 --> 03:43:24.340
A trash can.

03:43:24.340 --> 03:43:26.340
There's just magnets on it.

03:43:26.340 --> 03:43:28.340
Maybe they'll come in handy.

03:43:28.340 --> 03:43:31.340
I hope nobody will mind us taking them.

03:43:31.340 --> 03:43:34.340
I have magnets now.

03:43:34.340 --> 03:43:36.340
What's over here?

03:43:36.340 --> 03:43:38.340
The door.

03:43:38.340 --> 03:43:40.340
Trash can.

03:43:42.340 --> 03:43:44.340
Is that it?

03:43:44.340 --> 03:43:46.340
Your books?

03:43:46.340 --> 03:43:48.340
Who knows that?

03:43:48.340 --> 03:43:49.340
I think it's in here.

03:43:49.340 --> 03:43:53.340
Looks like I can un-latch this door.

03:43:53.340 --> 03:43:55.340
Nice.

03:43:55.340 --> 03:43:57.340
Nothing is locked right here.

03:43:59.340 --> 03:44:01.340
There's dirt now.

03:44:20.340 --> 03:44:22.340
How old is Nico?

03:44:22.340 --> 03:44:23.340
About a kitten.

03:44:23.340 --> 03:44:25.340
Nico's a kitten.

03:44:25.340 --> 03:44:27.340
Nico's quite young.

03:44:27.340 --> 03:44:28.340
And cute.

03:44:28.340 --> 03:44:30.340
Hello again, Messiah.

03:44:30.340 --> 03:44:32.340
Do you need help?

03:44:32.340 --> 03:44:33.340
No.

03:44:33.340 --> 03:44:35.340
Off you go then.

03:44:35.340 --> 03:44:36.340
Off you go.

03:44:36.340 --> 03:44:38.340
I'm going.

03:44:38.340 --> 03:44:41.340
Nico's a baby.

03:44:41.340 --> 03:44:44.340
Nico's a cute little baby.

03:44:48.340 --> 03:44:51.340
I hope this helps you grow a little seed.

03:44:52.340 --> 03:44:56.340
Seeds in the soil, but it looks a bit dry.

03:44:59.340 --> 03:45:01.340
Good thinking, Sarah.

03:45:01.340 --> 03:45:04.340
Oh, there should help this seed grow.

03:45:05.340 --> 03:45:06.340
Hmm.

03:45:06.340 --> 03:45:09.340
The dirt's nice and moist now, but...

03:45:09.340 --> 03:45:11.340
What if it dries out?

03:45:11.340 --> 03:45:14.340
There's only so much water in this little tube.

03:45:14.340 --> 03:45:16.340
I'll hold onto the tube for now.

03:45:16.340 --> 03:45:18.340
Just in case.

03:45:19.340 --> 03:45:22.340
I'll be giving it dirt and water.

03:45:22.340 --> 03:45:24.340
But will that be enough?

03:45:24.340 --> 03:45:26.340
I can't wait.

03:45:26.340 --> 03:45:28.340
I'm coming to you.

03:45:46.340 --> 03:45:48.340
I'm losing so much time.

03:45:48.340 --> 03:45:50.340
I probably have 42 minutes of work already.

03:45:50.340 --> 03:45:52.340
I hate this.

And I saw water up here.

03:47:06.340 --> 03:47:09.340
Can I, like, take water from there?

03:47:19.340 --> 03:47:23.340
Or is it not gonna ask me for it yet?

03:47:33.340 --> 03:47:36.340
Am I missing something?

03:47:38.340 --> 03:47:42.340
I think I'm missing some sort of information.

03:47:43.340 --> 03:47:47.340
I don't know what I'm missing, though.

03:47:48.340 --> 03:47:51.340
I think I'm missing something.

03:48:01.340 --> 03:48:05.340
I had my fan blowing in my direction this whole time.

03:48:06.340 --> 03:48:09.340
I really hope it wasn't loud.

03:48:12.340 --> 03:48:15.340
Was it, like, super loud?

03:48:16.340 --> 03:48:21.340
I, like, just noticed the fan blowing in this direction.

03:48:24.340 --> 03:48:26.340
No?

03:48:28.340 --> 03:48:30.340
No? No?

03:48:31.340 --> 03:48:33.340
Does anyone hear it?

03:48:33.340 --> 03:48:36.340
I turned it down just in case.

03:48:46.340 --> 03:48:51.340
I get stuck in games like this a lot. Me, too.

03:48:51.340 --> 03:48:55.340
Did you find the computer in the area?

03:48:55.340 --> 03:48:58.340
Oh, yeah, that's right! I forgot all about that.

03:48:58.340 --> 03:49:01.340
Yeah, I found that. They gave me a film.

03:49:06.340 --> 03:49:10.340
I heard nothing. The fan I was talking about was you, obviously, silly.

03:49:10.340 --> 03:49:14.340
Oh, yeah, I have to get this. This thing.

03:49:15.340 --> 03:49:18.340
It's bolted to the table.

03:49:24.340 --> 03:49:27.340
How do I get it off the table?

03:49:45.340 --> 03:49:48.340
I think I'm missing something.

03:49:48.340 --> 03:49:51.340
I don't know what I'm missing.

03:49:51.340 --> 03:49:54.340
I don't know what I'm missing.

03:49:54.340 --> 03:49:57.340
I don't know what I'm missing.

03:49:57.340 --> 03:50:00.340
I don't know what I'm missing.

03:50:00.340 --> 03:50:03.340
I don't know what I'm missing.

03:50:03.340 --> 03:50:06.340
I don't know what I'm missing.

03:50:06.340 --> 03:50:09.340
I don't know what I'm missing.

03:50:09.340 --> 03:50:12.340
I don't know what I'm missing.

03:50:13.340 --> 03:50:16.340
I got this. I can figure it out.

03:50:16.340 --> 03:50:19.340
I'm smart. I'm smart.

03:50:19.340 --> 03:50:22.340
I got this. I'll figure it out.

03:50:22.340 --> 03:50:25.340
I'll figure it out.

03:50:25.340 --> 03:50:28.340
We'll grab a hand first, and we'll see.

03:50:28.340 --> 03:50:31.340
Still clueless.

03:50:31.340 --> 03:50:34.340
Yeah! Yeah!

03:50:34.340 --> 03:50:37.340
Yeah, clueless.

03:50:37.340 --> 03:50:40.340
Yeah, clueless.

03:50:40.340 --> 03:50:43.340
Yeah, clueless.

03:50:43.340 --> 03:50:46.340
I'm so real clueless.

03:50:46.340 --> 03:50:49.340
We'll see.

03:50:49.340 --> 03:50:52.340
Thank you.

03:50:52.340 --> 03:50:54.340
I mean, figures.

03:50:54.340 --> 03:50:57.340
We have to do it like that.

03:50:57.340 --> 03:51:00.340
Well, no, Jim, yes.

03:51:00.340 --> 03:51:04.340
There is void beyond the four walls.

03:51:04.340 --> 03:51:08.340
The binder world to yours.

03:51:08.340 --> 03:51:12.340
The edges of your viewport.

03:51:12.340 --> 03:51:16.340
Where everything is obscure.

03:51:16.340 --> 03:51:19.340
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

03:51:25.340 --> 03:51:29.340
Pass the film through the void, and back again.

03:51:30.340 --> 03:51:33.340
I don't know.

03:51:33.340 --> 03:51:36.340
I don't know.

03:51:36.340 --> 03:51:39.340
I don't know.

03:51:39.340 --> 03:51:42.340
I don't know.

03:51:42.340 --> 03:51:45.340
The screen?

03:51:45.340 --> 03:51:48.340
Oh, the screen?

03:51:48.340 --> 03:51:51.340
I remember this part. It's so funny.

03:51:51.340 --> 03:51:54.340
Oh, sorry.

03:51:54.340 --> 03:51:57.340
Okay.

03:51:58.340 --> 03:52:01.340
I...

03:52:01.340 --> 03:52:04.340
I...

03:52:04.340 --> 03:52:07.340
What am I doing with this?

03:52:10.340 --> 03:52:14.340
Pass it through the void.

03:52:14.340 --> 03:52:17.340
And then back again.

03:52:20.340 --> 03:52:26.340
How do you pass this through the void?

03:52:27.340 --> 03:52:30.340
Back again.

03:52:30.340 --> 03:52:33.340
Through the void.

03:52:33.340 --> 03:52:36.340
Back again.

03:52:44.340 --> 03:52:47.340
What?

03:52:47.340 --> 03:52:51.340
I don't get it.

03:52:51.340 --> 03:52:55.340
It's windowed currently, yeah?

03:53:05.340 --> 03:53:09.340
Oh!

03:53:09.340 --> 03:53:13.340
Oh!

03:53:13.340 --> 03:53:16.340
Oh!

03:53:26.340 --> 03:53:30.340
I feel that I'm still an accident.

03:53:31.340 --> 03:53:34.340
That's what they mean by the void.

03:53:34.340 --> 03:53:37.340
That's so stupid.

03:53:37.340 --> 03:53:40.340
That's so stupid.

03:53:40.340 --> 03:53:43.340
I can't believe I forgot.

03:53:43.340 --> 03:53:47.340
I don't remember any of this.

03:53:47.340 --> 03:53:51.340
I played this game so long ago.

03:53:51.340 --> 03:53:54.340
Memory lane.

03:53:54.340 --> 03:53:57.340
That's so dull.

03:53:57.340 --> 03:54:01.340
I'm not going to tell a single soul what I did.

03:54:01.340 --> 03:54:05.340
When one day you play the game yourself,

03:54:05.340 --> 03:54:08.340
when one day you play the game yourself,

03:54:08.340 --> 03:54:12.340
it'll be stuck like me.

03:54:12.340 --> 03:54:15.340
It'll be stuck like me.

03:54:15.340 --> 03:54:18.340
It'll be stuck like me.

03:54:18.340 --> 03:54:21.340
It'll be stuck like me.

03:54:21.340 --> 03:54:24.340
It'll be stuck like me.

03:54:24.340 --> 03:54:27.340
Like me.

03:54:35.340 --> 03:54:38.340
It'll get stuck.

03:54:38.340 --> 03:54:41.340
It'll get stuck.

03:54:41.340 --> 03:54:44.340
It'll get stuck.

03:54:49.340 --> 03:54:52.340
Let me see.

03:54:52.340 --> 03:54:55.340
Where do you put the code?

03:54:55.340 --> 03:54:58.340
Was it up here?

03:54:58.340 --> 03:55:01.340
Was it up here?

03:55:01.340 --> 03:55:04.340
I don't know.

03:55:04.340 --> 03:55:07.340
What was the code for?

03:55:07.340 --> 03:55:10.340
Was it a code again? Do you guys remember?

03:55:10.340 --> 03:55:13.340
Do you guys remember the code?

03:55:13.340 --> 03:55:17.340
I need you guys to help me remember the code.

03:55:18.340 --> 03:55:21.340
My little bleeding hearts help me.

03:55:32.340 --> 03:55:34.340
Hi, Zara.

03:55:34.340 --> 03:55:37.340
Start to watch your videos and make me happy and comfy.

03:55:37.340 --> 03:55:40.340
I hope you do it.

03:55:40.340 --> 03:55:43.340
Do it well in the future.

03:55:43.340 --> 03:55:46.340
Thank you. Appreciate you for stopping by.

03:55:46.340 --> 03:55:49.340
I'm glad you find my videos nice and cozy.

03:55:49.340 --> 03:55:52.340
I hope you will continue to find them nice and cozy.

03:55:52.340 --> 03:55:55.340
Thank you.

03:56:04.340 --> 03:56:07.340
Look at it again.

03:56:11.340 --> 03:56:14.340

03:56:14.340 --> 03:56:17.340

03:56:22.340 --> 03:56:25.340
Stabler.

03:56:28.340 --> 03:56:31.340
Do I need a stabler?

03:56:44.340 --> 03:56:47.340
I'm so confused. What now?

03:56:59.340 --> 03:57:02.340
What now?

03:57:02.340 --> 03:57:05.340
Uh oh, I'm yelling.

03:57:05.340 --> 03:57:08.340
Was there a place that needed a lock?

03:57:08.340 --> 03:57:11.340
That had a lock on it?

03:57:29.340 --> 03:57:32.340
Do you guys remember a place like that?

03:57:32.340 --> 03:57:35.340
But a lock on it?

03:57:38.340 --> 03:57:41.340
That needed a passcode or something?

03:57:48.340 --> 03:57:51.340
Don't be afraid to ask if you are hungry.

03:57:51.340 --> 03:57:54.340
I want to make you something.

03:57:58.340 --> 03:58:01.340
I don't remember seeing anything that a lock on it.

03:58:02.340 --> 03:58:05.340
I don't know.

03:58:23.340 --> 03:58:26.340
This is the bed, right?

03:58:26.340 --> 03:58:29.340
Yeah.

03:58:29.340 --> 03:58:32.340
I don't need bed right now.

03:58:32.340 --> 03:58:35.340
I'm in bed.

03:58:59.340 --> 03:59:02.340
A game like this?

03:59:02.340 --> 03:59:05.340
I hate how I'm going to use my head,

03:59:05.340 --> 03:59:08.340
but it's so satisfying to be.

03:59:08.340 --> 03:59:11.340
Yeah, I agree.

03:59:11.340 --> 03:59:14.340
I also hate using my head.

03:59:20.340 --> 03:59:23.340

No, it's not that.

It's terrifying.

04:05:50.460 --> 04:05:52.460

04:05:53.460 --> 04:05:55.460
Okay.

04:05:58.460 --> 04:06:00.460
Does she, like, do anything?

04:06:00.460 --> 04:06:02.460
Can I give her something?

04:06:02.460 --> 04:06:03.460
Is she gonna...

04:06:03.460 --> 04:06:05.460
Does she like something?

04:06:05.460 --> 04:06:06.460
Like...

04:06:07.460 --> 04:06:09.460
What does she want?

04:06:11.460 --> 04:06:12.460
Hello.

04:06:13.460 --> 04:06:14.460
Hello.

04:06:16.460 --> 04:06:17.460
Uh-huh.

04:06:23.460 --> 04:06:26.460
How do you go ahead and rock it to red people's rooms, yeah?

04:06:32.460 --> 04:06:34.460
I'm still monitoring you.

04:06:34.460 --> 04:06:36.460
Alert level has been set to low.

04:06:36.460 --> 04:06:37.460
Don't worry.

04:06:37.460 --> 04:06:39.460
Bronze will be a good cast.

04:06:49.460 --> 04:06:50.460
But...

04:06:51.460 --> 04:06:53.460
But what am I supposed to do here?

04:06:59.460 --> 04:07:01.460
Where can I stick the magnets onto?

04:07:03.460 --> 04:07:05.460
And what do I do with the codes?

04:07:21.460 --> 04:07:23.460
Like, what am I missing?

04:07:30.460 --> 04:07:32.460
I just got back from dinner.

04:07:32.460 --> 04:07:34.460
I hope what did you eat yet?

04:07:50.460 --> 04:07:52.460
I took my meds, don't worry.

04:07:55.460 --> 04:07:58.460
You guys reminded me.

04:07:59.460 --> 04:08:01.460
Taco burger is what?

04:08:03.460 --> 04:08:04.460
That sounds amazing.

04:08:06.460 --> 04:08:08.460
I really need to find a way to get to the library.

04:08:09.460 --> 04:08:10.460
On the surface.

04:08:10.460 --> 04:08:12.460
Or the library on the surface.

04:08:20.460 --> 04:08:21.460
Oh, what?

04:08:21.460 --> 04:08:23.460
How do you get it to fit?

04:08:51.460 --> 04:08:53.460
This man said something about magnets.

04:08:53.460 --> 04:08:57.460
But I don't see a way of these fitting into the panel by themselves.

04:08:59.460 --> 04:09:02.460
The only thing that I can think of is the tape.

04:09:03.460 --> 04:09:06.460
But I walked up to the tape.

04:09:06.460 --> 04:09:08.460
I clicked on the tape.

04:09:09.460 --> 04:09:11.460
But nothing happened.

04:09:12.460 --> 04:09:13.460
I'll take this one there.

04:09:13.460 --> 04:09:14.460
I'll take this one there.

04:09:14.460 --> 04:09:16.460
Yeah, see you.

04:09:21.460 --> 04:09:30.460
And the only hint I have is this table.

04:09:30.460 --> 04:09:32.460
I mean this tape.

04:09:33.460 --> 04:09:36.460
Like, what do you do with this tape?

04:09:36.460 --> 04:09:38.460
What do you do with this tape?

04:09:42.460 --> 04:09:44.460
Feel free to use though.

04:09:45.460 --> 04:09:47.460
Can I, like, take some?

04:09:48.460 --> 04:09:50.460
Give me tape.

04:09:51.460 --> 04:09:53.460
There's no way to use this tape.

04:09:54.460 --> 04:09:55.460

I don't know.

04:10:05.460 --> 04:10:07.460
There's no way to take it off.

04:10:08.460 --> 04:10:09.460
Right?

04:10:24.460 --> 04:10:25.460
Need a hand?

04:10:25.460 --> 04:10:26.460
Yeah, I need a hand.

04:10:26.460 --> 04:10:28.460

04:10:28.460 --> 04:10:30.460

04:10:38.460 --> 04:10:40.460
Give me a little hand.

04:10:55.460 --> 04:10:57.460
I'm missing an item.

04:10:57.460 --> 04:10:59.460
Look at that.

04:10:59.460 --> 04:11:01.460
Is it not the tape?

04:11:03.460 --> 04:11:05.460
How do I get this item?

04:11:11.460 --> 04:11:13.460
There's something to do with the codes.

04:11:14.460 --> 04:11:15.460
Right?

04:11:21.460 --> 04:11:23.460

um and make a joke about the sword throw what i think we're all too happy for that

04:36:47.580 --> 04:36:55.020
um it probably none of the jokes you'd threaten me would probably even like

04:36:55.740 --> 04:37:03.100
faze man i have how many times i've received throat jokes it's crazy i had a nickel

04:37:03.100 --> 04:37:08.860
for every time i received one i'd be rich i would really bother swollen throat

04:37:09.820 --> 04:37:17.420
so i get the near the stomach before it enters the stomach it's extremely swollen

04:37:17.980 --> 04:37:23.660
i really badly swollen but it's it's it was getting better since the last time they checked

04:37:24.780 --> 04:37:25.420
so i am

04:37:29.500 --> 04:37:30.380
it's getting better

04:37:30.380 --> 04:37:40.300
they said my doctor did it endoscopy and they were like uh it's probably swollen because of

04:37:41.020 --> 04:37:47.180
i had too much stomach acid in my stomach uh so they had me on a bunch of medication to reduce

04:37:47.180 --> 04:37:55.420
the stomach acid to get rid of the ulcers i also had erosion like there was like big black

04:37:55.500 --> 04:38:01.420
blotches in my stomach that was like eroding my stomach walls were eroding

04:38:03.740 --> 04:38:09.180
they were like it's probably because of uh either medication you are taking or the stomach acid

04:38:11.100 --> 04:38:12.860
so they had me on medication for that

04:38:16.300 --> 04:38:25.260
yeah so yeah so they was like uh i had me a bunch of medication i was sleeping i remember

04:38:25.260 --> 04:38:31.420
i used to sleep for like more than 13 hours because all of medication they gave me they told me

04:38:31.420 --> 04:38:41.100

04:39:55.980 --> 04:40:00.540

04:40:09.660 --> 04:40:15.980
rest to get better mama oh well oh well don't worry we're having a good time here

04:40:16.940 --> 04:40:17.660
where are they at

04:40:21.260 --> 04:40:26.780
how many medications have you been on in your long life as a goddess

04:40:29.100 --> 04:40:34.780
well i mean so they found this mass in my nose they told me it wasn't the c word

04:40:34.860 --> 04:40:48.940
i said it wasn't that um which is thank goodness but um i had this

04:40:50.140 --> 04:40:57.660
thing in my nose for a long time for about seven years and my doctors kept telling me i was fine

04:40:58.220 --> 04:41:02.140
it's nothing to worry about all you're fine oh it's probably just a headache

04:41:02.220 --> 04:41:07.420
i was probably just stressed i was probably just this probably just that like there's nothing

04:41:07.420 --> 04:41:14.300
wrong with you you're fine so for seven whole years seven the nine years they kept dismissing me

04:41:14.300 --> 04:41:29.980
sending me home so uh yeah um i one day i was working i was working at a job and i got hit with

04:41:32.220 --> 04:41:38.220
like this is after they were already trying to fire me because i had a doctor's appointment

04:41:38.220 --> 04:41:42.780
every week i had to see a therapist every week because i had just got out of the hospital

04:41:44.300 --> 04:41:52.380
i just i got out of the hospital so i had to see a doctor every week and um it was mandatory and uh

04:41:52.460 --> 04:42:03.740
uh uh um in order to get my medication i had to see the therapist therapist wouldn't prescribe

04:42:03.740 --> 04:42:09.740
me anything unless i talked to them directly so it was mandatory that i went to these doctors

04:42:09.740 --> 04:42:17.020
appointments and it was mandatory that i went to see my therapist i'm on and my psychiatrist

04:42:17.020 --> 04:42:23.580
however um my the place i was working at did not like this even though i told them

04:42:24.380 --> 04:42:31.580
before they hired me i set it on my application that i cannot work on this day which is

04:42:32.380 --> 04:42:43.020
what would be old monday monday monday mondays i'm i'm i'm i cannot uh do anything on mondays

04:42:43.020 --> 04:42:48.540
and tuesdays because i added tuesday because i have other doctors appointments that

04:42:49.660 --> 04:42:56.140
layer on top of monday doctor appointments so now it's monday and tuesdays where you most likely

04:42:56.140 --> 04:43:05.020
won't see me which is why i don't stream on mondays and tuesdays last week or this week was a exception

04:43:05.020 --> 04:43:13.020
so yeah

04:43:15.980 --> 04:43:25.660
it took them my job did not like the fact that i worked those days uh that i had to

04:43:25.660 --> 04:43:33.100
go to my doctor's appointments those days so they uh they let me go and then they asked me

04:43:33.100 --> 04:43:43.580
if i wanted to continue um if i wanted to continue working the next few days with them

04:43:43.580 --> 04:43:54.700
and i said yeah and lo and behold at two days before my last day i got sick like it wasn't

04:43:54.780 --> 04:43:58.300
like a normal sick

04:44:11.500 --> 04:44:17.180
it wasn't like a normal sick i got a headache was i um

04:44:17.340 --> 04:44:24.940
was a really really really bad headache my throat my throat is really

04:44:26.620 --> 04:44:29.500
all right my throat is fine i'm fine

04:44:32.060 --> 04:44:36.140
i think i just need to take pain pain meds real fast uh the other ones

04:44:38.860 --> 04:44:41.820
these i take only when i'm feeling a certain pain

04:44:47.820 --> 04:44:53.020
i think these i'll be fine i'll be okay all right don't worry don't worry don't worry

04:44:57.980 --> 04:45:05.260
wow i got like an excruciating headache while i was working um this job

04:45:06.140 --> 04:45:09.020
and it wouldn't go away i had taken um

04:45:17.900 --> 04:45:29.980
i had taken some like painkillers for the headache and the headache didn't go away

04:45:29.980 --> 04:45:36.940
i was so confused and it just persisted and got worse and worse and worse i'm like this is

04:45:36.940 --> 04:45:45.020
the same headache i had like six years ago like this is the headache this is the pain

04:45:45.100 --> 04:45:52.460
that i felt in my face that would not go away um and then it like just suddenly went away like a little later

04:45:54.780 --> 04:45:57.420
uh and i'm like whatever so

04:46:00.140 --> 04:46:05.420
and like no this this is not it this is this something wrong this one very very wrong

04:46:06.060 --> 04:46:14.060
and the pain just traveled like in between the crease of your eye you know the nose the bridge of your nose

04:46:14.620 --> 04:46:18.460
and that's where the pain was the bridge of my nose in between my eyebrows

04:46:21.180 --> 04:46:23.020
um yeah

04:46:26.620 --> 04:46:30.460
and it just it was like vibrating throughout my whole head

04:46:31.100 --> 04:46:33.020
like starting from the front of my face

04:46:33.740 --> 04:46:45.180
it was like that it was like wouldn't stop suddenly every light in my vicinity every bright light

04:46:46.140 --> 04:46:52.380
i couldn't open my eyes if i opened my eyes the headache got worse it was so

04:46:53.180 --> 04:47:01.260
bad i had to go home had to go home i do not remember if they called the hospital or not

04:47:03.980 --> 04:47:21.820
my uh my uh my mom wasn't very um mom in back then she didn't mom back then um when i was working

04:47:22.300 --> 04:47:26.940
she didn't want to come get me she had a car at the time and she didn't want to come get me

04:47:27.500 --> 04:47:31.020
because she was sleeping and i was working late night it was like

04:47:31.020 --> 04:47:37.260
uh 10 in the morning not 10 in the morning sorry 10 at night or something like that

04:47:38.060 --> 04:47:44.940
she didn't want to come get me and i worked that late night shift and i was very far away

04:47:44.940 --> 04:47:55.580
from home so i had to pay like 160 something dollars no i'm reading that it was this it was

04:47:55.580 --> 04:48:04.860
70 something dollars for a cab to take me home because i couldn't

04:48:06.060 --> 04:48:12.140
kind of ride it on train or bus or anywhere i can take public transportation

04:48:17.980 --> 04:48:21.660
so i ended up going home

04:48:21.980 --> 04:48:32.380
and then i went home and then i just remember being in excruciating pain and i couldn't come

04:48:32.380 --> 04:48:39.740
into work for the next two days because i wasn't just i don't i can't remember it was really bad

04:48:41.500 --> 04:48:46.620
it was so bad that my brain is literally blocking out a majority of my memory

04:48:47.580 --> 04:48:53.340
but it was really bad and then i had to go to the er and the er did a

04:48:54.620 --> 04:49:02.060
um they wouldn't like uh they wouldn't like really check me out as it was an emergency

04:49:03.820 --> 04:49:10.940
they wouldn't check me out i went to the er and they were like well since it's like

04:49:11.900 --> 04:49:18.380
your head and stuff we don't have the equipment to test you for anything

04:49:22.940 --> 04:49:24.860
we don't have any we can't help you

04:49:27.980 --> 04:49:36.060
so i was there for like six hours and they had me sitting in a chair and they refused to see me

04:49:36.940 --> 04:49:50.940
uh and then i remember them giving me pain meds and a referral to go see a professional in that

04:49:50.940 --> 04:49:53.900
record and i had to wait

04:50:02.220 --> 04:50:06.700
no they didn't give me pain meds it was after they gave me pain meds after

04:50:07.340 --> 04:50:10.940
it was after the second trip to the er because i had to go a second time

04:50:11.580 --> 04:50:17.260
because the pain got even worse it was it was the second trip i went to the er

04:50:17.660 --> 04:50:26.060
wait after uh so i they referred me to a professional and i had to wait to see the i had to wait

04:50:27.820 --> 04:50:36.220
three months to see the professional and and while waiting in between that time while waiting

04:50:36.220 --> 04:50:43.340
i had to go back to the er because i was in too much pain i couldn't sleep i went like days without

04:50:43.340 --> 04:50:50.380
sleep i was in so much pain to the point where i would pass out just to sleep i'd pass out i would

04:50:50.380 --> 04:50:57.740
cry i was crying i remember crying crying and crying and wanting it to just end

04:50:59.500 --> 04:51:09.020
i wow what's that crying i just wanted it over i wanted it to end it was like the worst pain ever

04:51:13.500 --> 04:51:22.860
i don't think i'll ever experience pain like that ever again and i never want to go through that again

04:51:28.460 --> 04:51:31.020
am i better now yes don't worry i'm better now

04:51:32.060 --> 04:51:37.500
what's better now it was just the whole process of all of it and then missing that appointment

04:51:37.500 --> 04:51:42.860
after three months and then running out of pain meds i ran out of pain meds

04:51:44.700 --> 04:51:49.020
after the three months and then i had to i had to wait another three months

04:51:50.300 --> 04:51:52.940
because they didn't want to schedule me any earlier

04:51:54.860 --> 04:52:01.100
another three months and then the er never gave me another refill for the pain meds so it was in pain again

04:52:01.100 --> 04:52:09.660
and then for the whole three months and then i finally saw the doctor and he gave me medication and

04:52:10.620 --> 04:52:21.980
i remember my face swelling like a balloon it was so big my face was massive my head was huge

04:52:22.620 --> 04:52:27.020
i felt like my eyeballs was gonna pop out of my my fucking head

04:52:27.900 --> 04:52:35.580
oh gosh i was just remembering it as alice as so much

04:52:35.580 --> 04:52:54.620
it was it was horrible

04:52:57.580 --> 04:53:04.220
and then the doctor treated me well he found out i had chronic severe chronic sinusitis

04:53:05.580 --> 04:53:10.780
i had lymph like what do you call them the lymph nodes or something and some other stuff

04:53:11.500 --> 04:53:19.020
all up in there i had like everything all of the above it was where i had tissue infected tissue

04:53:19.020 --> 04:53:27.100
that spread near close to my brain and they said if it was left untreated for another like

04:53:27.100 --> 04:53:33.740
year or so and more that it probably would have spread to my spine and then maybe eventually

04:53:33.740 --> 04:53:37.820
became the bigsy so

04:53:44.060 --> 04:53:50.460
so that mass that i found um they found in my nose wasn't even found during that appointment

04:53:51.900 --> 04:53:58.940
during that entire timespan the mass that was found in my nose was at a place and no other doctors

04:53:58.940 --> 04:54:03.980
have heard about they kept sending me to a different place that took x-rays and they were like

04:54:03.980 --> 04:54:09.900
oh we found a mass in your nose why not probably not that big of a problem and then they gave me

04:54:09.900 --> 04:54:16.460
like a cd scan or the cat scan or whatever you want to call it they gave me it i remember sleeping

04:54:16.460 --> 04:54:21.500
in this machine i had to sit in this machine for three hours while they were scanning my face

04:54:21.500 --> 04:54:31.500
and they uh they didn't find they didn't find anything else just the mass and then uh i went to

04:54:31.500 --> 04:54:36.860
the doctor and told him about it and then they were like from where did you go and i was like this

04:54:36.860 --> 04:54:41.980
place and they're like never heard of it so i had to do it all again at a different place

04:54:44.220 --> 04:54:47.660
and that took two years to do two whole years

04:54:52.140 --> 04:54:57.740
um you know there's so much and i hope you know how to go through this ad again

04:54:58.460 --> 04:55:07.820
me too me too not fine though now um then i had my first ever surgery

04:55:09.740 --> 04:55:17.180
they scheduled me for surgery last year last year february last year february

04:55:18.060 --> 04:55:25.980
so i have been fine for the past year uh just i was healing a lot uh afterwards there was a lot of

04:55:26.700 --> 04:55:33.020
a lot of bleeding i couldn't blow my nose i had to be careful with sneezing

04:55:33.900 --> 04:55:41.340
because if i sneezed it was just red everywhere red red

04:55:41.740 --> 04:55:50.780
i had to be careful with holding my head down or it would just leak red everywhere red

04:55:54.780 --> 04:55:59.900
so i had to lay in bed because i was on like heavy medication i just woke up from anesthesia

04:55:59.900 --> 04:56:01.740
and i was just like laying there like uh

04:56:02.060 --> 04:56:11.740
i was so nervous i waited so long to get the surgery because they they said they'll wait

04:56:11.740 --> 04:56:18.860
because they knew i was really scared because he did um the doctor did warn me that it was very

04:56:18.860 --> 04:56:27.020
close to my brain um that there could be chance that if they were to mess with anything like

04:56:27.980 --> 04:56:36.300
hit anything that it could affect my personality my emotions and something else and i remember

04:56:37.340 --> 04:56:44.540
and then they were like then the other doctor i know it's like procedure and i have to tell you

04:56:44.540 --> 04:56:48.780
that you could possibly you know perish

04:56:49.340 --> 04:56:54.540
but the way he said it to me scared the living

04:56:55.340 --> 04:57:02.380
let me shut out of me okay and that's why i waited he scared me so much

04:57:06.060 --> 04:57:09.900
he was like and death and he gave me a look like

04:57:10.620 --> 04:57:13.020
oh

04:57:18.140 --> 04:57:25.020
no we didn't finish the game we're just trying it up we're gonna play the game next week next

04:57:25.020 --> 04:57:33.020
week on stay that's likely

04:57:33.260 --> 04:57:42.700
so i was on a bunch of medication for that whole timespan i was on like

04:57:43.740 --> 04:57:53.260
so much pain meds antibiotics uh stuff for my stomach i was on uh like

04:57:54.540 --> 04:58:00.540
some some other stuff i don't remember what for so i was on that and then i was on it for

04:58:01.340 --> 04:58:07.500
uh the headaches because this is before they found out about my spine and my shoulder

04:58:08.460 --> 04:58:16.300
this is before that so i had that and i was on i i i messed up my knees

04:58:17.500 --> 04:58:20.140
i had all accident so my knees are messed up

04:58:23.660 --> 04:58:29.980
i only have physical things wrong with me it's not that bad i know people got it worse so

04:58:30.540 --> 04:58:33.900
i just went through some really messed up experiences all of these things could have

04:58:33.900 --> 04:58:42.620
been caught and fixed if the doctors weren't so dismissive of me uh and actually believed me

04:58:42.620 --> 04:58:48.940
one doctor told me that it was all in my head another doctor told me that uh that i was only

04:58:48.940 --> 04:58:55.580
coming in for the pain medication they were saying that i was an addict uh another doc another

04:58:55.580 --> 04:59:01.420
doctor turned me away uh because i came too much too frequently uh because i was in pain

04:59:02.780 --> 04:59:15.020
um i also had uh the uh i had an ovarian ovarian ovarian cyst on my left ovary that burst

04:59:16.940 --> 04:59:22.620
i had to call 911 for that one i couldn't walk i couldn't move i couldn't do anything

04:59:22.940 --> 04:59:25.980
and 911 came and picked me up

04:59:28.700 --> 04:59:32.700
um uh it did a little

04:59:37.900 --> 04:59:44.060
i felt it and heard it uh when it did uh when it popped i was taking a massive

04:59:44.620 --> 04:59:47.820
a mash of shit on the toilet

04:59:50.940 --> 04:59:55.900
i was i was constipated i was taking a massive

04:59:55.900 --> 05:00:05.180
massive poop and i strained too hard and all i felt and heard was and i was like ah what was that

05:00:05.820 --> 05:00:12.860
that was weird and then the pain gradually got worse and i'm like ah

05:00:18.460 --> 05:00:20.860
and i was like dragging myself on the floor like

05:00:25.100 --> 05:00:27.260
when my pants down half down

05:00:28.060 --> 05:00:33.420
i was calling out to my mom

05:00:44.460 --> 05:00:51.260
wait did you wipe first nothing came out i was straining i said i was constipated nothing came out

05:00:57.500 --> 05:00:59.260
i was taking the poop

05:01:07.340 --> 05:01:14.700
then they took a like a like a uh ultrasound of the cyst and it was the size of a tennis ball

05:01:14.700 --> 05:01:21.340
it was massive it was huge it was like a massive cyst on my on my left ovary it was massive

05:01:21.340 --> 05:01:29.740
and just like a little bit of it like popped so i was bleeding only inside

05:01:31.100 --> 05:01:32.620
so i was a well tennis ball

05:01:43.820 --> 05:01:48.300
they were worried they they had to monitor me i was in the hospital for two days that day

05:01:48.380 --> 05:01:55.740
they had to monitor me to make sure i didn't like you know bleed out eternally

05:01:56.540 --> 05:02:02.860
and uh since i'm also like anemic slightly on the borderline uh the more blood i lost

05:02:06.460 --> 05:02:12.220
it was cold and i was very tired so i had to uh they had to be careful

05:02:13.340 --> 05:02:17.580
um so they wanted to watch me and monitor me they took so much blood for me

05:02:17.580 --> 05:02:20.300
that's how they had to monitor me they took so much

05:02:25.980 --> 05:02:26.700
it was a lot

05:02:34.860 --> 05:02:41.420
yeah i got to break uh i'm uh i've been through quite a lot over the past couple of years

05:02:42.060 --> 05:02:49.580
so that's all right though it's what made me me makes me me makes me who i am

05:02:49.980 --> 05:02:55.820
i suppose pray i'm just very accepting i guess

05:02:59.820 --> 05:03:04.060
and i have many other stories but we could save those for the other side

05:03:05.260 --> 05:03:08.380
right now this is just my some of my medical stories

05:03:12.060 --> 05:03:15.980
so i'm just glad i'm off quite a couple of the meds now i'm not on a lot of them

05:03:15.980 --> 05:03:23.180
so i'm happy now right i am and i only hope for better things i didn't have a lot of support

05:03:23.180 --> 05:03:30.460
as i was getting older i had to do everything myself so i guess you could say i matured way too early

05:03:30.460 --> 05:03:37.500
for my for the age that i was when i was younger i had to do everything myself

05:03:37.580 --> 05:03:43.660
i had to teach myself many things that many young young girls should definitely have already

05:03:43.660 --> 05:03:47.420
been taught i had to teach it to myself so yeah

05:03:55.340 --> 05:04:01.180
wait some yeah because there is a lot of girls that aren't taught these things i mean as in some as in

05:04:01.180 --> 05:04:06.300
like the glass half full kind of thing i mean there are some girls out there that don't know

05:04:06.300 --> 05:04:13.420
currently that they're they were like me there's a lot that do know right now i mean some as in

05:04:13.420 --> 05:04:20.300
there are some girls out there who still right now at this moment still aren't taught about hygiene

05:04:21.580 --> 05:04:24.300
as they should be taught even now

05:04:37.100 --> 05:04:48.940
uh i've been there a bit i've had my extreme extreme downs extreme downs my therapist was four

05:04:53.980 --> 05:05:00.700
we don't talk about those those are not what i'm gonna cover anytime soon maybe like

05:05:01.020 --> 05:05:03.100
like years later down the line

05:05:22.780 --> 05:05:27.820
but i also had my ups so i was satisfied i found some people who support me

05:05:28.540 --> 05:05:36.140
and my endeavors so i'm very happy um and a lot of family issues i've had

05:05:36.140 --> 05:05:43.660
has been sorted out so yeah i just need to to eventually find a place of my own so i can

05:05:43.660 --> 05:05:51.900
do my own thing yeah let's go do my own thing yeah i wanted my own thing

05:05:52.140 --> 05:05:59.500
and i want to pursue this v-tubing thing that i'm doing right now um quite some time

05:06:02.140 --> 05:06:05.980
it's my uh main source of of living

05:06:14.460 --> 05:06:15.820
i hope you all understand

05:06:16.620 --> 05:06:22.860
i am totally understandable i understand

05:06:26.860 --> 05:06:28.220
thank you i'm glad

05:06:35.180 --> 05:06:41.580
i know it's less important but i feel like we aren't uh we aren't taught proper hygiene either

05:06:41.660 --> 05:06:45.260
and i think guys aren't taught proper hygiene either as well

05:06:47.980 --> 05:06:55.100
i know one thing for for sure is that there are guys who actually truly believe that you don't wipe

05:06:56.140 --> 05:07:00.380
that you don't need to wipe the the pepe the pepe

05:07:01.340 --> 05:07:10.380
uh but uh the the the pepe there's there's there's there's actually guys out there who

05:07:10.380 --> 05:07:16.380
aren't taught that or don't know or other guys taught them not to do it so it's not their fault

05:07:16.380 --> 05:07:23.900
really but there are guys who teach other guys that i have been around quite a few of them

05:07:24.060 --> 05:07:33.500
um in the past long long time ago don't talk to them anymore though because they were um

05:07:34.220 --> 05:07:36.300
they're rude they're rude people

05:07:41.500 --> 05:07:49.260
but if you are a guy that don't know about wiping you do wipe you do you do a tap tap

05:07:49.420 --> 05:07:54.780
you could take just one or two squares and do a tap tap you tap it up tap it up tap it up tap

05:07:54.780 --> 05:08:01.180
up tap up the tip tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap and wipe

05:08:04.220 --> 05:08:09.500
there's nothing too extremely it's like yes a lot of people might find it gross but it is what it is

05:08:10.060 --> 05:08:16.460
so don't judge too harshly understand their situations or circumstances that they probably

05:08:16.460 --> 05:08:27.260
weren't taught

05:08:31.580 --> 05:08:32.140
it's okay

05:08:35.660 --> 05:08:39.100
and i understand the little jokies that are made where you know

05:08:39.100 --> 05:08:45.900
oh yeah people just helicopter it up

05:09:10.060 --> 05:09:15.260
this is not a joke this is not the sacred ritual i wouldn't know

05:09:20.540 --> 05:09:22.620
it requires a lot of rhythm

05:09:24.780 --> 05:09:29.900
i'm working them hips huh we're working them hips

05:09:39.100 --> 05:09:48.700
it's not just the way but leaving the washroom and not washing hands

05:09:50.620 --> 05:09:58.700
please please wash your hands please wash your hands i know there are guys who don't

05:09:58.700 --> 05:10:08.860
who don't even need to use hands hands free but still wash your hands wash them wash

05:10:09.100 --> 05:10:14.060
your hands you touch the door knobs you touch the doors you had to come into there

05:10:14.060 --> 05:10:21.900
you had to leave you had to touch things wash your hands it is gross that is gross wash your hands

05:10:22.460 --> 05:10:35.100
all right as long as you wash your hands

05:10:38.940 --> 05:10:40.700
someone's gonna run for it boys

05:10:41.660 --> 05:10:42.300

05:10:47.980 --> 05:10:52.300

05:10:57.100 --> 05:11:00.700
tell me someone stays in there i'll shake it out

05:11:01.100 --> 05:11:11.740
do you wash your hands it's good good good don't worry it's not just boys

05:11:11.740 --> 05:11:17.020
i know girls that do the same thing a lot of boys don't know this but there are girls

05:11:17.020 --> 05:11:23.420
that literally don't even like they don't clean up after themselves trust trust

05:11:24.380 --> 05:11:28.620
don't think just because a lot of girls bathrooms are like super spotless sometimes

05:11:28.620 --> 05:11:34.140
and has like pretty plants and stuff but those bathrooms are disgusting

05:11:34.940 --> 05:11:42.860
you see things that you don't want to see don't want to see things left unflushed

sequence

05:13:12.860 --> 05:13:25.860
We do not harshly judge them as they're probably, like I said, not taught, not taught, didn't learn, learned the hard way, self-taught, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

05:13:28.860 --> 05:13:35.860
I knew of girls that didn't even know about shaving at all, like overall.

05:13:36.860 --> 05:13:49.860
And it becomes very unhygienic not to shave or trim because if hairs get really long, too long, you can accumulate bacteria and stuff.

05:13:50.860 --> 05:14:01.860
And women are very susceptible to UTIs, it's easier for women to get them the most.

05:14:02.860 --> 05:14:11.860
So we gotta take cleanly, like so you take care of your little beddies, take care of your little beddies.

05:14:13.860 --> 05:14:27.860
It's called a urinary tract infection, you get an infection in the, in your bladder basically, or in the, your, your, your itta.

05:14:28.860 --> 05:14:44.860
Yeah, guys can get it too, but you guys get less, less chance of them getting it because you know, you guys have a longer ways to getting to the bladder unlike women.

05:14:45.860 --> 05:14:55.860
Got shorter, shorter ways of getting there, so bacteria can travel faster, easier for women than for men.

05:14:58.860 --> 05:15:03.860
Is that like guineastones? No.

05:15:04.860 --> 05:15:12.860
But I think the pain could be similar, the pain could be similar.

05:15:28.860 --> 05:15:33.860
Oh my god, I'm not gonna read that.

05:15:37.860 --> 05:15:41.860
Yeah, so hygiene is very important, so make sure you take care of yourself.

05:15:41.860 --> 05:16:04.860
Yeah, I think you have a fire, we'll take care of it, stay clean in that regard, and you won't have to worry, at least you don't have your, your parents telling you it's gonna fall off.

05:16:12.860 --> 05:16:29.860
I heard that's what a lot of, a lot of boys got told when they were younger that it was gonna fall off as they don't take care of it.

05:16:30.860 --> 05:16:31.860
Yeah.

05:16:35.860 --> 05:16:37.860
And even as a student.

05:16:41.860 --> 05:16:43.860

05:17:00.860 --> 05:17:05.860
