you know, everyone's been asking about you,
it's not every day that someone new moves in, it's quite a big deal,
so you're moving into your grandfather's old cottage,
it's a good house, very rustic,
rustic, that's one way to put it, that's rude, crusty, oh,
I need to disrespect, wow,

so that you buy one of her house of grains,

Oh. Is that it? Can you say anything else?
Did I meet everybody? Was that a book? A book?
Was that a book? Where?
The book where?
Can't tell what I got.
I got this.
A prehistoric Hand X.
Nice answer.
To take.
That's what I picked up.
Don't you just like, just chillin.
Relaxin.

I can't play the songs on stream, but I can sing them for you.
That's so much better, right?
Grilled artifact.
Am I missing someone?
What am I missing?
Uh, Abigail.
Oh, alright. I forgot they had a son.
I really had a son.
Oh boy.
Oh, and Linus. Right about Linus.
Who's there?
Absmole.
Not a single person in the entire collection.
Absmole.
Eapsmole.
What's this? You found something? Let me see it.
Remind me of the ball.
It's very old.
It's very old. It's very old.
I love studying it.
Greater detail, but it's yours.
It is yours.
I've got a favor to ask you.
Would you consider donating any new artifacts and minerals that you find?
We could make ground breaking the story together.
Oh, and who knows?
If you keep donating, I might come across some interesting items to send your way.
Think about it, will you?
If you decide to donate, just bring the objects to the front desk.
Okay.
Is there a way to turn down the music?
This is really loud for me.
No matter how much I turn it down, it's so loud.
It's still loud.
Okay, there we go.
It's quiet for me now. It's so loud.
E-Haul, partner.
Acapella is better.
I like my acapella singing.
My horrendous singing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Sleepy.
In my head.
People watching me.
People watching me.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
Well, since we're out and about, why don't we...
Well, we don't have space.
We don't have any space to fish.
We can all catch a couple of the same fish.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
It's like they're watching me.
Wait, I need to talk to you.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
It's like they're watching me.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
You can bet that, never got a sweat that.
Boom.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
My stomach won't stop grumbling.
My stomach is grumbling, really, really hurting.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
It's like I'm losing my mind.
Papa.
Emma.
Is that everybody? Then I talked to everybody.
I swear it was everybody.
Oh Linus.
Linus, oh.
No, bad theory.
Okay.
An Abigail.
Linus, Abigail.
Wait.
I'm not even going to be empty?
Oh, I can fish a little bit.
Yeah.
Oh, what's that?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm not going to be empty.
I think it's just a baby.
It's just a baby.
More carrots! Let's go!
Yay!
I like carrots.
Carrots are nice.
This is right here.
It's a nice little spa.
Oh, I was like, where's my pushing room?
Touch.
Touch.
I remember.
Touch.
Touch.
Touch.
I remember.
I remember.
Oh, where do I belong?
Touch.
I'm something poor.
In my life, I'm fine.
I need something more.
In my mind.
Touch.
Touch.
I remember.
Touch.
Pictures came like touch.
Painter in my mind.
Tell me what you see.
A tourist and a dream.
Visitor, it seems.
A half-forgotten song.
Where do I belong?
There's no fish in here.
Tell me what you see.
I need something more.
Kiss suddenly alive.
Happiness arrived.
Hunger like a storm.
How do I begin?
A room within a room.
A door behind a door.
Touch where you leave.
I need something more.
Tell me what you see.
I need something more.
Oh, my God!
I got it. I got that.
No! No!
Touch.
Touch.
Touch.
Touch.
Touch.
Touch.
Can I do a storm in Prussia from X-Men?
Anime is serious?
I don't know.
Never tried.
But I have to hear her voice again.
I haven't heard her voice in a long time.
It's been a long time since I heard her voice last.
Hold on.
If love is the answer you.
Hold on.
If love is the answer you're home.
Hold on.
If love is the answer you're home.
Hold on.
If love is the answer you're home.
Hold on.
If love is the answer you're home.
Hold on.
If love is the answer you're home.
Hold on.
If love is the answer you're home.
Hold on.
If love is the answer you're home.
Hold on.
If love is the answer you're home.
Love is the answer you hold hold on
Love is the answer you hold
I got this one
I got this one
I'm gonna get this one
It's balancing on water
The plant is Jesus
It's Jesus
Uh oh
Oh no
Can I make it back in this maze?
I don't get stuff
Let me out
Freedom
One fish of each, I think
Should be good
Carrots
Can I make a little bit of Buccarones?
Beautiful voice, why do I like you?
Oh, why do I feel like, wow
Wow, I'm fooling myself
Why do I feel like you could do Steven Universe songs really well?
I sung quite a lot of, my favorite song is Steven Universe's
Pearl song
It's over, isn't it?
Why can't I move on?
One of my favorite ones
Weeping
Unofficial karaoke stream, yeah, super unofficial
Maybe Anya
Maybe Anya
Pearl song hurts a bit
It hurts, like, emotionally
Emotionally
War and glory, reinvention, fusion, freedom
I have tension out in daylight
My potential, bold, precise, experimental
Who am I now in this world without her?
I'm petty and dull, the nerve to doubt her
What does it matter, it's already done
My wife got to be there for her swan
It's over, isn't it?
I don't know, isn't it over?
I love that song
Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee
Look what you've done, now I have to listen to it
Look what you've done
Shhh
Yeah
Gotta pause the game
Gotta pause the game
I was fine
With the mint
Would come into her life now and again
Oh, I was fine
So I knew
That didn't really matter until you
I was fine
Okay
I felt I was all some silly game
Over her
Would she choose
And now let's see if I'd ever thought I'd lose
It's over, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it over?
It's over, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it over you want
And she chose you
And she loved you
And she's gone
It's over, isn't it?
Why can't I move on?
War and glory
Reinvention, fusion, freedom
Retention, out in daylight
My potential, bold, precise
Experimental
Who am I now in this world without her?
Petty and dull with the nerve without her
What does it matter, it's already done
Now I've got to be there for her son
It's over, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it over?
It's over, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it over you want
And she chose you
And she loved you
And she's gone
It's over, isn't it?
Why can't I move on?
It's over, isn't it?
Why can't I move on?
Browl
Browl
I love that song
Uh-oh
If I could begin to be
Half of what you think of me
I could do about anything
I could even learn how to love
When I see the way you act
Wondering I'm coming back
I could do about anything
I could even learn how to love
Like you
Like you
Like you
Like you
Like you
I always thought I might be bad
But why so glad I've skirted you
I think you're so good
And I'm nothing like you. Look at you go. I just adore you and I wish that I knew
What makes you think I'm so special
If I could begin to do something that does right by you
I could do about anything. I would even learn how to love
When I see the way you look shaken by how long it took
I could do about anything. I could even learn how to love like you
Love like you. Love me like you
Come out of your room. I need to greet you. Come out
I loved SU for a long time. Touched my heart. Touched my heart in ways that not many cartoons do
Yeah
Here comes a thought that does calm the mind
Yeah
Let me in when she come out her room
You'd be surprised that I can be really loud when singing
Kind of creepy as hell
I can sing really really loudly but given the fact that I do live with my family
I'm actually singing really quietly
I can't sing any louder
I can get really really really loud
Super super duper duper loud
Yeah, I felt a tiny bit rushed but even though it felt a little rushed
It was still okay. I think it was really good
But is it only her? Does she come out?
Is she still in her room?
I'm only waiting for her to come out
What the f- Where'd she go? Where is she? Where'd she go?
What the f- Where is she?
What the f- Where? What?
What the f- This bitch! Where'd she go?
It's empty
It's empty
How she just live? I don't understand
I was waiting for her
What the f-
She avoiding me. She didn't like me
Oh wow, it disappeared
Give me the fish
Give me that fish
Give me that fish
What if it was you hanging up on this wall?
If it was you, I'd say how much you would be laughing at all
Don't know why that- I don't know
I haven't heard that- I haven't heard a jingle from that commercial in so long
Nor have I heard the song anywhere
I don't know why it decided to enter my brain just now, but it did
What the f-
What, even just singing a song can look a bad?
Oh someone sent me, thank you so much
For the $5 tip
All for fun
Tip for our enchanting song-tris
Thank you, thank you for the tip
I didn't hear it
I didn't hear it go off at all, actually
Try because I muted this
Try because I muted this because the game is so loud for me
I turned this down
Remova
Remova's here
Remova can't move it there
I broke it
I broke it
I broke it, let's just pretend I didn't touch nothing, I didn't touch anything
Yeah, I mean I like us you ending for what it is
But after hearing all the behind the scenes drama, it could have been so much more
It could have, it's so true
So much happened
So much happened
Dang, my whole playlist is now
S.U. songs
And Disney songs
There's just a bunch of Disney songs
You do it for him
And you do it again
You do it for her
That is to say
About the future, I ain't back to where your damn is
Fucking with that passion baby
I'm worried about the future
Future, future, future, future, future
Future, future, future, future
Future, future, future, future
Future, future, future, future
Oh you know what I forgot about?
Birthdays
I ain't no good about that, I'm gone
I ain't make a dollars, at least I'm making sense
But I buy a dollar, money, give me money?
Oh, you started?
I do it
Ain't no sucker baby
And inspect it
I'm worried about the future
I think I broke, hang on
Give me one second
It broke
It broke
I
Can't got no time to waste on bullshit
Uh oh
Second place
Oh
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
I do it
You saw nothing
The farm is going pretty good
We're all relaxed and chillin
Have a good time
Is any birthdays coming up?

On my house
