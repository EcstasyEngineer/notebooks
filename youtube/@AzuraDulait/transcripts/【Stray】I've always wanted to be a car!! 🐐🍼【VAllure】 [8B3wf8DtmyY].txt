And since I've been so busy lately, I haven't really been like sleeping for that amount of time, I just realized my headphones weren't even on.
My body just needs more sleep than the normal person.
Oh, this is a little tight on my chest, hang on.
Oops, oops, okay, sorry.
My apologies.
I was doing a little stretch.
Okay, so is this okay?
How's my volume, everyone?
It's my volume, okay?
Am I peaking for anyone? Let me know so that I can fix that.
I don't want to pee.
Wow, it's good.
I am fine.
Alright, it sounds good.
I'm fine, it's good.
I don't trust you guys who have me on speaker.
How are the headphone folks doing?
You can't tell on speaker.
That's what you all told me you didn't notice it last time.
They seem better because you're here.
Thank you Lazy today.
You've been waiting for your Oshis dreams.
But your Oshis is here now.
If you mean me, that is.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Ayane is contagious.
Ayane is contagious.
I'm not epi, I'm not epi, I swear, I swear.
So I have my audio, it's good.
And TV audio, I speak your audio.
Everything's good, that's good.
I'm not beating and sleeping.
I know what you mean.
I know what you mean.
I don't want to say.
I know everyone was looking forward to the work out ASMRs.
So was I.
But I had to let you guys know that I did get a big, big warning.
The last true.
So we might not be able to work out ASMRs.
As we did it in the last stream.
We might have to make some huge adjustments or just do some normal ASMR.
So I hope you're all okay with that.
Until we're safe to do so.
Until we're safe to do otherwise.
Yeah, the naughty cookie really did it for us.
It was the biggest morning.
So now we gotta be extra, extra careful.
Just don't eat so horribly.
I don't think that's possible.
I think we should just play it safe.
I don't want to take any chances.
As either I toy with it and then I can hit really hard and then I can't stream for a long time.
Or we toy around it.
And there's like a 20% chance it's okay.
I don't think we should take that chance.
As it's too strong for actually seemingly everything I do seems to be a little too much for the YouTubes.
Oh boy.
Hang.
Let me scoot in a little more.
My neck.
I think I slept so wrong.
My neck is killing me.
I look up in like the strangest position.
I have my arm like behind my neck like behind my head.
Like my left arm behind my head.
My leg was twisted.
I was like upside down like half on my back and half on like then my like front.
My ass was like slightly sticking up in the air.
I went to sleep as soon as I like ended a stream.
I fell asleep and then I woke up at like 4am.
I woke up at 4am to like use the bathroom.
I ate like a little more like leftovers.
And then I like I tried to go back to sleep.
I couldn't go back until like another two of hearts.
I woke up like maybe like an hour ago.
I don't know.
I was like leaning on my wall like half in the air.
I tried.
I tried to get some good sleep.
But it's hard.
So hard.
Why am I sleeping so hard?
Okay.
It's raining.
Everyone's now flooding in coming in.
Saying hello.
I'm learning.
How are you?
Afternoon.
Ow.
Ow.
Everything's crackling.
Crackling popping.
Ow.
My knee.
Ow.
I can't.
Ow.
My knee.
I am fine.
I'm not sleeping.
I'm not sleeping.
I promise.
Oh.
I plan to have a thought through stream.
We're talking about my upcoming birthday event.
So I hope you all look forward to that.
Where I talk about my birthday coming up.
And I want to discuss what plans and things I want to do for it.
So I hope you're looking.
I'm not giving back.
I'm looking forward to that.
Love of day.
Yeah.
Because it's been like, a month and a half.
Two months from now.
Technically.

I don't like anchovies
I'm already hesitant on eating fish in general
so
I'm not fond of anchovies

I think you eat it like

It's so scary. It smells so funny.
It's sitting on one and a half.
One and a half because I was too scared to put it any higher.
But then it started doing the cooking since the smell tasted like paper burning.
Is it supposed to smell like that? Is it supposed to smell like that?
Really?
Is it a common smell? It smells like paper burning.
I'll put it back in. I'll put it back in because I can't stop it because I'm scared.
I'll put it back in. The bread is already super hot. It's already hot.
My hands are shaking. I'm so scared.
It's okay.
It's fine.
It came out.
It came out. It's so short.
I can leave it in there a little longer. It's not toasted. It's not toasted at all.
It has a big cancel button on the toaster. I've never had a cancel button on a toaster.
I turned it up a little bit.
It's not going to catch fire or explode or anything, right?
It's starting to smell good. It smells good.
It smells good.
Ow!
I have toast. It's toasted.
I have butter. I have butter on my toast.
I have butter on my toast. It smells good.
I have butter on my toast. It smells good.
I have butter on my toast. It smells good.
I can't.
It tastes so good.
I don't have any jelly or jam. I don't have jelly.

Beans.
I don't have cheese. My fridge is empty right now.
I have to go food shopping.

Our long-gone ancestors, the soft ones, left us the city. Our home is their legacy. A soft one.
Humans, our only ancestors can distinguish these colors. They said they once dominated the world.
The ancient stories speak of natural light that leaked from a star and landed at our feet.
This light caused warmth and well-being in our ancestors to help them grow.
Hello, I'm the merchant of the market.
You give me something, I'll give you something in exchange. It's as simple as that.
This is a set of electric cable, the vessel market. I'll exchange this for a super spirit.
Detergent? That's the best I can do.
This is a music sheet, a masterful piece of art. It will cost you one energy drink, I can't do less.
This is an ancient relic, a testament to the talent of our ancestors. It will cost you three energy drink cans, I can't do less.
I'll be back.
We're lethal, we're fortunate to have these items to help us defend against the Zerg. The Slums have its threats, and preparation is key.
We came across fake pictures like this sometimes. All talking about the outside. Beautiful dream, I guess.
Look at all the hidden gems in this trash, pennies from heaven or from somewhere anyway.
A blue sky, ha, imagine that.
I believe in the outside life, I wish to touch grass.
This is an ancient relic, a testament to the talent of our ancestors.
I'm cat.
We go. All the weird stuff always happens to you, mate. I don't dare to leave our village, it's too dangerous. Besides, the Guardian is the only one who can open this door.
That's a pretty picture, fake but pretty. Fake.
Zack, I left it in the streets, and the next day the Zergs had consumed it completely.
That's crazy, right? They can eat everything.
Another picture of the outside. Get out of here with that stuff, it's all nonsense.
This is an ancient relic, a testament to the talent of our ancestors.
Just jumping on random things, extreme cat-like behavior. Remember who you really are.
This is so fun, I like jumping on random things.
Music, shit. Come on.
This is a strange notebook with a symbol on it. This one seems to belong to someone named Clementine. Everything is going according to plan.
We managed to contact the upper level before the transceiver went down. They are in a place called Madown, and apparently it's controlled by some kind of oppressive force.
I talked to Momo earlier, his eyes. I know of this look. He will not come with us.
I don't know what this means, but it will probably be useful later.
We should go see that Momo person, who Guardian told us about.
I should have not done that. My nose hurts now.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I feel like we're going to play in the playing little cave big city. I think I saw that game before. I think I saw it. I actually really want to play that. That sounds fun.
What's up here? What's that? Give me. I want it.
Can I go up? Can I not go up? Oh, what's that?
What's that sound at the door? It's probably nothing.
Let me in.
I want to talk to everyone else back in the town.
Can I do that? There's so many things here. Oh my goodness, we got to be careful. Almost fell.
What's this?
It looks like this park I also wanted to go to the upper level. As I remember, the town is up there, away from all the garbage and sickness of the slums.
Sudden music scared me.
You can snap a sneeze by saying grip throat three times, can you? I'm going to try that.
Even at dire times, humans cannot help but divide themselves by social class. Back then, a lot of people from the slums were prepared to do anything to move up there.
Apparently robots also occupy this behavior.
You do look a little like a jerk. I'm far away at least. They look and sound cute, but don't be fooled. Those things chew through metal. Horrifying.
Oh, is that the outside when Momo keeps talking about? Music sheet, I don't play any instruments, sorry.
Oh yes, everyone around here knows the symbol, it's the outsiders. They live on the upper floors of this area. You can probably talk to Momo about this.
Oh wait.
That's that.
Man, this is just directions.
This was the road up there, I won't tell you.
Do you want other troublemakers playing with the paint buckets

The succession of zeros and ones.
We must be able to decipher this code in a way or another.
It is probably related to the state.
Can I examine it?
I see.
I need to drink.
Cool.
I keep pressing the wrong button.

Hello?
My PC just turned off on me.
It just said,
and everything turned off.
So I assume it was like an update.
Everything just turned off.
Hang on.
Let me put a little bit in this.
Who met the fire?
Who met the fire?
I really like this tiny who met the fire.
I thought it was going to be like a big donut.
But I was wrong.
It's not a big donut.
It's so cute and tiny.
It's so cute.
It's like a strawberry donut.
And I love strawberry donuts.
These are my favorite donuts.
That alongside, um,
vanilla, vanilla donut.
And a strawberry donut.
It's so cute.
It's so cute.
I am so sorry.
My computer had a big update.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
We'll wait for everyone to come on back.
We'll wait for everyone to come back.
I'm sorry.
I died.
Mommy didn't abandon you.
I swear.
Mommy is here.
It's okay now.
Mommy is here.
Mommy is back.
Mommy is here.
Don't worry, my poor baby.
Mommy.
Mommy would never abandon you like that.
You are so brave.
So patient for me to come back.
So brave.
So brave.
Good job. You did so good.
Such good boys and such good girls.
Good job.
We're back now. We're back.
Hopefully everyone can refresh and come back again.
We're back again.
Don't need to be scared. Not anymore. Mommy's here.
Let me pull up some stuff.
It's so cute.
Everything was just closed out entirely.
Everything is gone.
Oh boy.
All right.
Did we lose our save?
I don't know if it saves along the way or saves when you exit the game.
But we didn't lose much progress.
I hope I hope.
I don't know.
Let's go back again.
I'm so good at maneuvering.
I can't see.
I'll take that.
We lost quite a bit of progress, but not a lot.
I didn't realize it, but I was bouncing my knee.
So it was doing this the entire time.
I'm like, why is my screen shaking?
Why is my screen shaking?
I was bouncing my knee.
Oh, I got to stop that habit.
It's a really big habit of mine to bounce the knee.
I don't know how to stop that kind of habit.
What's this?
Remember?
Yeah, I had to reopen all of my tabs.
Remarkable.
Companions have evolved so much.
In the earlier days, in the early days, their simple AI merely imitated human act.
Now this is all their own.
Humans often said that making art is important in desperate situations.
These are certainly desperate times.
I'll unlock some more memory.
A chair.
A chair.
A chair.
A power supply.
A chair.
I think this lit me.
Water.
Water for the kitty.
Is water even good to drink?
Haha.
I can't make a mess.
Wait, do something in the box.
Wait, give me.
It's a strange notebook with a symbol on it.
This one seems to belong to someone named...
Z-B-L-A-Z...
Sorry, what the...
Oh.
Z-B-L-A-Z-T-Z-R.
Z-B-L-A-Z-T-Z-R.
All traces of organic life has disappeared except for what we call the Xerx.
They seem to eat almost anything that moves and breed at an inconvenient, inconceivable rate,
as if being locked in the city wasn't hard enough.
I don't know what this means, but it'll probably be useful later.
Oh my gosh, my buzz with my English.
English, please.
Ball-T-Z-R.
Ball-T-Z-R.
Balls-T-Z-R.
Balls-T-Z-R.
We should go see the Momo person.
A little guardian told us about.
All these boxes.
More boxes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wee.
Is there that nothing else in here?
Oh.
If they ever come back down here and their home is going to be a mess.
Destruction, destruction.
Please don't bother Vapora. She's so clumsy.
Don't bother, you say.
I can move there?
No.
Careful, I need to focus.

It's a very old binary code you have here.
Only a real geek can read this.
Oh, I can nap here.
Ipitae
I'm swimming out.
It was like silk.
I ended up falling asleep while watching the stream.
That's fine with me.
I can't sleep.
That's perfectly fine.
It's swimming out so much.
I'm curious too to know how far it zooms out.
I'm also curious.
It's still going.
I want to make another toast.
I'm drinking a red bull.
Did it stop zooming?
It stopped zooming.
If you fall asleep, you'll doodle something on your face using a permanent marker.
I'd draw the outrageous things on your face.
If you give me the opportunity to do it, I'll do it.
It seems like a really fun town to live in.
I know how unsanitary and hard it is to live in a place like this, but I don't know.
I'd like it only because of the aesthetics.
But I know deep down I'd actually really hate living there.
Tell us to Spanish.
There's a way to live in a place like this and keep it clean and sanitary.
I'd live in it.
I'd definitely live in it.
I need a paper towel.
Paper towel or paper towel.
I wish I had jelly.
I wish I had jelly.
I want jelly.
Jelly only sounds really good.
Because I don't ever do jelly and butter, like both.
I've done that before, like jelly and butter.
Jelly and butter on the toast.
I think it tastes really good.
Okay.
Okay.
What's that?
Hello.
We gave you such a face.
You have a brown buff face.
Hep door.
Oh hey, it's you.
You do look weird and small.
But there's something about you.
Be compelled to pet you.
But I won't because I don't understand why.
The surface?
Oh, it's a sensitive subject around here.
There are some whose code can understand that concept.
There are ones who know about the outside but are too resigned to do anything.
And then there's the outside.
Let's get me.
311.
Wow, time really goes when you're enjoying a story.
We're gonna keep going.
There's outsiders.
I can imagine how they feel.
Well, there's only Momo now.
What a face.
It looks like grandpa.
Oh, can I scratch this?
Oh yeah.
Eh, eh.
Living machine.
Take care.
You've been going to listen to your relaxing voice on falsely.
Good night, have a good night.
I'll take meds in an hour.
In an hour I'll take my meds.
Yeah, excuse me.
Oh, sorry.
Scratch everything I was here.
I'm a car, obviously.
Wait, how do you look at that?
What's up with the nose?
What is that?
Oh.
There's so many channels.
Not a little bit creepy.
I got an achievement.
Browse to all the TV channels.
I got an achievement for that.
Am I supposed to be here?
Oh.
How to develop your artificial intelligence in order to be a creator.
Let's create a real human.
Oh, another music sheet.
Let's go.
Destruction.
Oh.
I don't think I have anything to unlock that.
Hey doc, I found a key to your safe.
You need to be more careful with the game item.
It's not enough to bury your safe behind a bunch of books.
Just the librarian.
Anything else in here?
What?
Oops, excuse me.
Wait, do I have the key now?
Can I unlock it with the key?
Is this it?
Oh, I do.
Nice, it's a strange notebook with a symbol on it.
This one seems to belong to someone named Doc.
The initial attempt was explosive.
I might have to test it under real conditions.
I found the design flaw in the transceiver, but I think I figured out how to fix it.
Here's the equation.
I don't know what this means, but it'll probably be useful later.
We should go see that Momo person who Guardian told us about.
Hey, destruction of books.
What's that?
Oh, it's a little space to lay down.
That's so cute.
It zooms out here too.
Good night.
I think it stops here.
What do you tell if they have in this game? It's so awesome.
Is this the librarian?
Did these books fall on top of the librarian and knock them out?
Were they reading and the books killed them?
It looks like the books fell on top of them.
Let's come help them out.
That's so sad.
That's so sad.
That's so sad.
Okay.
How do you get up there?
Is there not a way up there?
There's no way up there.
How to go down?
Down.
Okay.
Drama clothing.
I do love knitting so far.
I've knitted 478 miles of scarves.
It's something to do.
If you bring me some electrical cable, dang mosquito.
Die.
I got it.
I got the mosquito.
Let's go.
Wipe my hands.
Good night.
I hope your dreams are filled with nothing but me.
I can make you a poncho.
You inspire me, but it's not easy to find the right materials around here.
Watch me find it.
I'll find it.
It's very pretty. It looks a bit peculiar to be real though.
Is there anything else around here?
Isn't this where I came from?
Oh yeah, this is where I came from.
Someone ran up here.
What's this?
Rip humans.
No, it's not the humans.
Are you triple for me?
Humans are the first residents around here.
They are all dead now.
What do you think it feels like being dead?
I don't know.
I never really thought about it much.
I'm lying. I probably thought about it a lot.
I wonder how it feels.
I know it's silly coming from me, but are they actually at peace?
Are they?
I don't even know.
But I like to think so.
Will I be at peace when I die?
I don't know what death feels like for an AI.
I'm sorry. I didn't want to break the mode. Let's move on.
It's okay.
A robot.
Another ending machine.
Hey.
It jipped me out of a...
There.
I thought it didn't come out.
Hello.
So, if today is yesterday's tomorrow, tomorrow will be yesterday's today, right?
That was weird.
We don't age like our soft one ancestors.
They're trapped here forever.
Damn, Rosie.
That was too deep for me.
I understand.
The eternity is a long time.
It's very pretty.
It would be so nice if it was real.
But it is real.
It's real, Rosie.
Denigusil.
Awawawawawawaw.
What?
You can't get it out of your head.
What?
Nobody knows.

It's a little laundry mat.
He's so angry.
Oh well, at least Cosmo's making use of that all that detergent.
Cosmo.
Oh no.
I have a bunch of stuff.
Where am I supposed to go?
Where am I supposed to go again?
Can I have this?
Super spirit detergent.
I have it.
I have a detergent right here.
Gimme gimme. Yay!
Can I have this music sheet too?
Yay!
How much is this?
Do I have enough?
Huh?
Oh.
I can't.
Oh yeah.
This is an early model of a companion.
Back then, they didn't have any personality.
They were just glorified on, I don't know must cleaners.
I think it's nice today that they eventually mimicked humans.
It's like they missed them.
I think it's nice today that they eventually mimicked humans.
It's like they missed them.
And in a way, they kind of kept them from going extinct.
They're good robots.
Even good robots.
I'm sorry, I don't have anything to exchange right now.
I took all his stuff.
It's all mine now.
All my stuff.
All my stuff.
Wait, I can get a poncho now.
This way.
What happened there? What's in there?
What's up here?
What's in there?
What's in there?
Wait, hold on.
A poncho.
Are they always here?
Are they always sitting there?
I didn't see that.
Poncho, please.
Thank you, my dear.
I'll get to work right away.
Poncho, for me.
Are you okay? I'm okay.
There you go, little one.
I'll suit you.
Some of my finest handiwork.
How do I put it on?
How do I put it on?
How... item?
Inventory?
Oh...
This looks really warm.
Perfect for a cold robot.
Uh, not for me.
I can't wear poncho.

It's so clean
It's this
Um,可以 you really consume this?
Their original design didn't have a digestive system. Maybe they somehow evolved by mimicking humans.
Do you think I should try some of it?
I do not want to be disrespectful of their ways.
Don't eat it!
What if it kills you?
Oh, they don't actually eat it.
I'm so good.
Eh.
Eh.
How do you get it inside?
Eh.
Eh.
Eh.
Yeah.
Haha.
I cleared the whole table.
Oh, it's on the floor.
It's on the floor.
What's this? Oh, music sheet.
Another ear.
Eh.
Carl! Carl!
Carl!
Carl!
This is the two's favorite from the people living above.
Level 2.
It's a few years old, but it's something to read.
Outside? Why bother trying to find it?
We're good here.
Carl!
I feel like I'm forgetting something.
Am I?
Oh, did I hurt the kitty?
Yeah.
What's up there?
How do you get up there?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh oh.
Eh, eh, eh, eh.
Oh.
What the?
I'm flying.
That kills people, Carl.
Carl, that kills people.
Carl.
He's so sad.
Why are you so sad?
Don't be sad.
Kind of like...
outsiders.
Carl.
Eh, eh, eh.
Eh, eh, eh, eh.
Eh, eh, eh, eh.
Eh, eh, eh, eh.
Ah.
Yes.
Shhh, shhh, shhh.
Shhh, shhh, shhh.
I destroy your home.
What was that?
Earth.
Earth is the third planet from the sun.
The fifth largest in the solar system.
By mass diameter, diameter, diameter.
Diameter.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Got it.
Diameter.
Yeah.
To date, it is the only celestial object known to foster life.
According to radiometric dating, the Earth is 4.54 billion years old.
It has a single natural satellite, the moon, which formed soon after.
The gravitational interaction with the moon creates the tides, stabilizes the Earth's access of rotation and gradually reduces its rotation speed.
Rotational speed is rotation speed.
Is rotational a word?
Why you sad, don't be sad?
Remember.
Back home.
Oh, back home too.
I remember this video game.
It was made just after I was created, I think.
I can't remember it well.
The scientist and I spent a lot of time playing it.
It was fun.
I miss him.
I can't remember his name.
Monster roll, boy.
Hello.
It's never going to work.
Why did I let them go?
I'm all alone now.
Hey, you.
What do you want?
This is a picture of the outside.
You want to go there?
Well, don't bother.
It's a waste of time.
It'll bring you only loneliness and despair.
My friends had this dream too.
But now they're gone and I'm all alone.
It's like a Hawaiian shirt.
I don't know where they ended up.
I tried to contact them, but that transceiver didn't work.
My friends and I took notes about research about the outside.
Here, take mine if you really want to go there.
No, you're all alone.
I'm done with this outside.
Good luck.
I don't seem very sad.
This is friends.
Let me check the notebook, people.
The outside.
The outside.
The outside.
I hear some madness.
The outside.
I can't read.
I can't read.
Help.
I can't read.

We must go outside.
And then we must protect our brothers and sisters.
We must stay away from Zergs.
Yeah.
It is sign of Clementine.
Bald.
Bald Pizarre.
Doc and Momo.
It looks like Momo's name was added later.
We should show them the other notebooks that we found.
Hey Momo.
Hey little cat.
Are you still looking for those useless notebooks?
I have them.
Have Clementine's.
Oh you found Clementine's notes?
She was really brave you know.
The most fearless person I ever met.
Oh.
Bald Pizarre.
As Bald Pizarre is notebook right?
I never quite understood.
What he was talking about most of the time.
But he was very wise.
Oh.
Docs.
Wait.
They actually found all my friends' notebooks.
Is that?
Oh.
What's that note?
The transceiver can be repaired?
This is incredible.
That means we should be able to communicate outside of Sloan.
Clementine.
Bald's a hard dog.
I'm sorry it's out of her cause.
I'll promise you.
I will find a way to reach the surface.
Thank you.
We might be able to find you a way up.
Yay.
Now let's fix this piece of junk transceiver.
It's fixed around the wall.
Around the wall.
Around the wall.
Et voilà.
It works.
Et voilà.
What do you mean?
What if I'm not ready to go?
What's this?
The city has...

We install the trans seever, at the top of that tower, which really communicates with the city.
My friend might still be outside from the dark.
We install the samasОd, as we saw in a short video of the Simade v Аte Muужjage.
Media comments and面 gun.
I watched the video as well but the recording looks interesting.
My friends might still be out there.
Up there is a way out.
They'll know it.
Really only one small and quick enough to evade the zirks.
We need you, little outsider.
Bring us to the sky.
This way.
Where am I?
Hey.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Is this safe?
Hmm, safe.
Very convenient buckets.
Rooftops.
Hmm.
I don't like this.
Scary.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Eh.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Aha, I can get me.
Oh, where we go?
From here?
Up there?
No, this way.
Remember?
Hmm.
The city is full of neon.
There's a noise this way.
There used to be strict energy caps.
Especially in the salt slums.
But people couldn't handle the constant darkness.
One day someone lit up ramble lamps.
Nian signs all over their house.
That person was taken away and never seen again.
But people saw hope.
And not long after, everyone started putting lots of lights in their homes.
There was nothing to the oppressors could do.
It was a way for the people to see color again.
Like on the outside, I think it helped.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Do we go that way?

Let's go from here.
Am I missing anything?
Am I missing anything?
Oh, what the?
Oh
Oh boy
This is so gross
It's all sticky. Yeah, it's super sticky and it makes really gross wet noises. It's like
It's really gross
It's sticky wet noises
Um
Oh
Go go go go go
No no no go go go go go go
Oh
Oh
How do you turn this off? I turned it on by accident
How do you turn off the light? How do you turn off the light? I turned it on by accident
Oh
Niko ni niko korp they're responsible for waste management
As trash from the upper levels overloaded the slums to try to develop bacteria to dissolve at all
After the humans disappeared that bacteria mutated growing eating way more than trash
And now we have zirks. Oh, no, let's go
Oh
It's all sticky
Oh
Ah
Oh
Wait don't I need this open?
Wait don't I need this open?
Like this
Oh
Oh
Oh, thank you
Oh

This is treachery
This is treachery
I have no clue what's happening
I don't know I thought it was a force restart
But I don't a force update, but I checked to see
I went to go check to see if my computer even has like even is on
To update for anything during this time and it's not it's not it's not set to update during this time
So it wasn't a force restart. I have no clue
My computer keeps turning off on me
It keeps turning off or restarting on its own and I have no clue why
I have no clue why I'm such bad luck. It's so bad. I don't know what's happening
Oh
It's not my internet my internet is fine like
Fairly getting fixed my internet is perfectly fine at the moment
So it's not my internet
Because if it was my internet then that would have turned off then that would have turned off and so would have this would have turned off
And so would have my fan and so my
Little broken half broken mini fridge would have also turned off
But no
So it's not my power. It's not my internet
Because the little bar thingy didn't pop up if it was the internet it wouldn't turn off my
Computer if it was the internet
Instead it would just disconnect me and then reconnect me disconnect me reconnect me, but if it was power
If it was power half of this side of my room would turn off
If it was power
But everything else is still on and running just fine. So I don't know what it is
We'll figure it out
later
We'll figure it out
Uh
For now I can like uh
I don't know turn this down. It's not any of this like I checked
My cpu everything is running everything is running smoothly
Very smoothly. Look at that everything rings running completely smoothly
Yeah, this is fine
This is fine
So is this so is this this is okay
Everything's fine
Yeah later
I'm gonna keep this on in the background so I can look at it just to see how it is. I'm playing
Like the purring and he's gonna come back in
At least it stopped right where we left off
And
This is a PC on its last legs impossible. It's a completely brand new rig
There's no way that it could be on its last legs my old computer. Yeah, that was on its last legs
But this is completely new
There's no way
I just have horrible luck when it comes to technology
That I know
That I know my head is big hang on
That I know
Oh
Oh, we have to do all of this again. Oh man
We need stronti and tekken. Right now main sound will help me with whatever needs to be done
It will help
They were responsible for waste management. Oh, yeah, we already read all of this
Main sound has been helping me with everything else. So
Bar we still can't figure it out meds. Oh, yeah, I haven't taken that
Let me take that right now. There's heart medication
No

This is my purpose. I have to open a city.
Come on, let's go back and find Momo. Not that we have connected the transmitter.
We should be able to get help.
Weee!
Weee!
Is our car have a name? Our car doesn't have a name.
Want to name the car?
Our car doesn't have a name.
Weee!
My cat had a similar toy by the way to this. I still have it.
It's like a little ball.
It was his favorite. He used to pick it up and walk around with it.
He would like zoom across the floor with it.
I can't. Where is it? Speech bubble.
Look, a note.
A little outside of your reading this. That means you're still alive. Excellent.
I took some equipment to the bar to take advantage of the antenna.
Come meet me there.
I've locked the window but the code to open it is quite simple.
It is.
That's supposed to be simple? The fuck?
It's not fucking simple.
Be careful. It is case sensitive. See, you have the bar.
Whoa, whoa.
That must be the code for the window near the entrance. Let's go.
Chad, remember that? Remember that? Remember the code for me?
Chad, remember that? Remember that? Remember that please?
Remember that?
The code was...
What was the code? What was the code?
What was the code?
It's my back.
Let's try it again.
Let's see. Success.
You guys did it! Yay!
I was at the bar waiting for house.
Oh yeah, the thing that came back.
I'm going to get the key.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on.

Like this?
Can I just aim?
F.
Dang.
Not enough.
Not enough power.
How to go down? Go down.
Release me.
I will get you to move one way or another.
You want something?
No, aren't you sitting earlier?
Oh.
No.
Let me see if I can get this thing working.
I almost got it.
Hello? Can anyone hear me?
Hello? Yes, we can hear you.
We're from the slums. We're looking for a way out and...
What is that? You?
Balzahar?
Mama?
I can't believe it. I'm so happy to hear your voice, Balzahar.
Where are you?
Are the others okay?
Yes, we are safe. We found a way out.
Hello?
Can you still hear me?
You have to go through the sewers to reach us.
Very dangerous. It lurks everywhere.
Sewers? How? Hello?
Darn it. We've lost the signal.
I can't believe it. Balzahar is alive.
He on the other outside has managed to go up through the sewers.
The sewers are the most dangerous place in the slums.
But if Balzahar made it, there must be a way.
Seamus.
Of course, it has to be someone named Seamus.
I...
You'll never get past the sewers.
It's infested with serics.
They'll make a quick meal out of you.
Especially you, little one.
Many try their luck in the past.
It doesn't end well.
Anyway, I warned you.
Your business is none of my business.
Seamus.
His father, Doc, used to be a great scientist.
He was working on some new weapon to fight the zirks.
So, years ago, he went off to test the device and never came back.
Seamus has never been the same since.
Don't listen to Seamus. He's just scared like I was.
If Doc build a weapon, that's our ticket to join the outsiders.
And as notebook Doc mentioned, the secret lab a few times.
That must be where he was working on it.
There might be a clue.
But I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know where he was working on it.
There might be a clue in Seamus' apartment.
Go on, follow me.
I follow Mr. Robot.
I don't know where he was working on it.
I don't know where he was working on it.
Can you move it away?
Grandma made a scarf. Isn't it wonderful?
She knits so well.
I don't know where he was working on it.
I don't know where he was working on it.
I don't know where he was working on it.
I don't know where he was working on it.
I don't know where he was working on it.
I don't know where he was working on it.

Wow. I never knew.
There's a secret room here, in our flat.
But where?
It's a very open area, we have there.
Oh, I really can't carry that.
Oh wait! Do you guys remember that code?
What was the code again?
Time will tell.
Eh?
What?
Oh!
Time will tell.
Time will tell.
Oh!
Here, what's that?
Two...

Two, five, one, one.
What's the code that you guys have?
What's that code for?
Meow.
Whoa.
I've never seen this room.
I can't believe you managed to hide it from me all this time.
How was it for the safe?
Oh, right. I forgot.
Yeah.
These blueprints...
They must be for his zerk weapon.
Papa was always so secretive with his work.
He told me the weapon was working.
In theory, but it needed a real life test.
He went outside the slums, and he never came back.
Robots, new headlines, zerk, are officially no longer under control.
They now eat metal.
The flux are blueprints.
Concept, light-based, handgun, low-priority, visual-appearance-size,
sceptile, emitted, high-priority, test in real condition,
objective, 20 zerk destroyed per second.
Let me down.
Is there anything in here?
Nothing, I don't know.
I'm stuck. Get it off me! Get it off me!
Okay, there you go.
Anything up here? No?
Observation.
They now eat metal, then why haven't they eaten everything?
Maybe because they take time? I don't know.
Maybe it takes time. Maybe this is...
They just developed into doing this.
Maybe they become intelligent.
Maybe there is smarter bacteria now.
I need dwelling.
They are just not that hungry.
Cute sounds, but never friendly.
Old bacteria of human time.
Eat all kinds of materials.
Total vision in the dark.
React to intense light.
I'll see, there you go.
Maybe because light stops them.
Maybe it's light.
Light stops them.
Am I missing something?
Oh, a box.
Find anything interesting in here?
Yeah, this broken tracker.
Wait, I remember that.
That's his tracker.
Papa always used that tracker to keep an eye on where I was.
Maybe he can reverse it to find where he went.
I can't believe my papa might still be alive.
I missed him so much.
You need a weapon for this herbs, right?
My papa definitely took one with him.
We just need to repair the tracker so we can find him.
Someone in the slum should be able to help.
Come with me. I'll open the door for you.
Whoa.
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
Meow.
Meow.
Meow.
You gotta fix that tracker.
You're resourceful.
Maybe you can find someone in the slum to help.
Alright, see you later, shameless.
I'll see you later.
You aren't always standing here. Who are you?
Look at all this great stuff that falls at our tracks.
So many treasures.
You should go visit Bart, Barterman.
There's something for everyone over there.
Bart, Barterman.
Barterman, yeah.
Barterman.
He's not Barterman.
He's Azuz.
Azuz.
Azuz.
Lito.

Thanks for the poncho.
Please come see if you ever need something fixed.
Yeah, I need something fixed. Destiny.
Oh wow, that's a great tracker. I recognize this model.
It's Touhima BR2000.
You can track anyone with this little gadget, may I?
Let me take a look. Just gotta give it an update and one more thing. Voila!
There you go, little one. Go look, find out who you're looking for.
Thanks, Elliot!
Elliot's so nice.
Really nice. That's a great trait these days.
If you ever want to hang out, you're always welcome. See you around.
I know, sir. Let me out.
Gee.

Oh, hehehe.
Gee.
Alright, energy rich yet? I'm poor.
Hehehe. I'm poor. Now I bring this back to Samus.

I guess.
Is everybody live right now?
Let's chill out for a little bit.
We'll go read the mercy.
Is there any sign of all the crashes that was happening throughout the rest of the game?
Big mommy.
That's me.
We're excited that the crashes kept happening.
It's so weird. I don't know why it was happening.
We'll both figure it out.
We'll come and figure out why it's happening.

You make me hungry.
I want french fries.
Are you sure you're just hungry?
Definitely hungry.
They're definitely hungry like me.
Good night.
We're all leaving right now.
Sweet dreams.
Hang on a second.
I'm not going anywhere just yet.
Hang on a bit.
You're such a rush.
Eight.
Yeah, I'm still going to go for a moment.
We're always going to chat for a little bit before I end.
Usually, unless I'm in a rush to go.
To go somewhere.
But I'm not always in a rush.
Let me try to do it a little bit.
Excuse me.
Are you liking the game?
Yeah, I love string.
It's a really good game. It's super cute.
I love the graphics. It's super nice.
The story is interesting.
So sad for the humans.
Super, super sad.
Super sad.
No, no, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
Excuse me.
Bye.
I'm not going through all of this.

after doing 40 push-ups yes yes yeah i get to play league one time
i would slow cook it on a pot rather than in the my ew you guys warm up milk in the microwave
i've always used the stove i've never warmed up milk in the microwave
i like barely i barely like warming up food in the microwave unless it's it says you have to
i do everything on the stove that stove has been with me through thickened thin
i have used that stove for everything
i have used that stove for everything microwave milk i have the sneeze
nope it went away instead my eyes are watery now
yes my milk is the best milk
i want some coffee too sometimes i do but why is it warm your milk up on the stove
i have never warmed up milk ever you should try it apparently warming up milk is really good for
bed for sleeping i used to drink hot chocolate before bed but i haven't been able to do that lately
it was that or tea i would have make tea honey lemon tea i had the honey myself and i haven't had
honey in a long time because my mom likes to to put the honey in the federator and it's so hard
and doesn't come out of the bottle who federates honey i don't understand i had an argument with her about it
like why do you put fucking honey in the fridge it's so stupid it becomes like super hard
just put it take it out it should for honey shouldn't be federated
fight me on that
can't use it
they put honey in a fridge and they say some ketchup shouldn't be federated but i like ketchup
federated it turns all like vinegary and smells bad unless you shake it if you take it out of the
fridge they say ketchup shouldn't be federated but there are some ketchup bottles that they
federate after opening but there are some ketchup bottles that they don't federate but people just
don't read bottles anymore to make sure so they leave the ketchup um out of the fridge
i think it's it tastes horrible and sour
cold honey is cool yeah but you can't it won't it doesn't move but it becomes hard
honey literally cannot go bad so there's no need to federate honey there isn't
it doesn't need to be federated
use a high spec for the honey i have some honey lemon tea a few days ago my throat because i
was a discord carry okay hurt my throat
a honey lemon tea is great how much honey do you do
i have a hundred
a hundred teabags probably a little less than that now because i've drunk a couple a
couple of tea maybe like 80 something 80 teabags now
a hundred yeah a hundred
i don't like leaving my house like yeah i buy everything i need it
but what is the expiration date does it have one does tea actually expire i don't think tea
expires tea can't expire can it tea can't expire can it you really
this fire there's no expiration date on this
yeah it's not expiration date
oh there is an expiration date oh
i have till next year i'm fine it's fine i have till next year
i have till February of next year we're fine
okay
how long does it take hot chocolate to expire
i bought 150 of those i don't have the box i'm not gonna go look right now
next year can pass really quickly with the treasury of tea such as yours i recommend drinking
about two bags a day i get sick pretty cool frequently so it should be fine
i get sick very frequently so it'll be used
so
i still play with my partner about sauce in the fridge it's mind boggling
i think only some things should go in the fridge honestly
only some things honey should be refrigerated it should it should not be
refrigerated it doesn't say on the bottle that needs to be refrigerated literally google it
and it will tell you that not all honey needs to be refrigerated i only put some sauces it says
it on the bottles if it says on the bottle refrigerate after opening it i'm putting it in
the refrigerator all right it says recommended put in refrigerator after opening and it's gonna go
in the fridge all right if it says it i'm doing it
well this is nonsense when you suck it on the bottle read it
okay
am i worried you guys gonna have gross expired spoiled food and still eat it because the
expiration date says it doesn't expire well it doesn't expire until unless you treat it the
way it says to be treated you you that's like leaving milk out and then saying oh well the
expiration date says it doesn't expire until like next month but you just keep drinking it because
you left it out for like a day and yeah well i don't need to refrigerate it because it doesn't
say it needs to be refrigerated but everyone knows knows needs to be refrigerated so you
refrigerate the milk just because it's got just because some milk can survive without being
refrigerated doesn't mean not all milk because survive not being refrigerated the same goes for
most other foods if it says it on a bottle you do what it says because they know better than you do
that's like this one person i used to yell at me about refrigerating eggs
they're like oh but if it came from a chicken then it doesn't need to be refrigerated
the whole point of refrigerating most eggs was to stop fertilization
keep them eggs cold

I think they had this whole mental of eat things as soon as you get it, but they didn't really understand the concept of storing food.
You put it in the fridge to keep it cold for a reason. You're keeping it cold for a reason.
You put it in the fridge to keep it cold for a reason.
Imagine leaving an egg out on the counter only to come home to a baby chick.
That has actually happened to some people where they had a, like a chickie.
It was like half formed in an egg because they left the egg out.
It was like halfly formed and then when they broke it open, like a chickie came out.
But it wasn't an alive chick though, unfortunately.
I think they stopped eating eggs after that.
Did they eat it? No, they were scared. They were shocked. They screamed.
I think they stopped eating eggs after that. I think it was very traumatizing for them.
I don't remember. I don't talk to them anymore.
I just heard that this year apparently fresh non-processed eggs can be kept out on a counter and be fine.
Yes, non-processed, non-processed, non-processed food can be left out.
The majority of it can, but not processed food. It does not work that way.
It does not work that way.
Some people just don't really do that much research to find out that it's not that way.
So they learn about this stuff online somewhere and then they never actually do self research to see if that information holds true.
For everything.
They just believe everything they hear and see.
You're guilty almost.
Do your research. Don't trust everything. So bully dilly.
Do your research. Oh my gosh, silly babies.
Do your research now.
Common sense is kind of eroded nowadays.
It's weird.
Well, I want to do a full-on zazu zazu zazu down.
