1342460	1343500	now
1343500	1355660	I've had some vegan food. Vegan food isn't too bad. There was like these like meatballs
1355660	1361660	that weren't really meat and I don't know what it was made out of and I ate it and it
1361660	1377580	was so good. I don't remember. It was like whole foods I think. It was very yummy. It
1377580	1385660	was super yummy. I didn't even know it was vegan. I just picked it up and I ate it.
1391660	1403100	That was crazy.
1403100	1405100	hmm
1414620	1420540	Adora is via lawyers most intellectuals from that's right
1421180	1428520	That's right. I'm the most intellectuals we're here. I know everything is to know about anything
1429580	1431580	I'm intelligent. Mm-hmm
1433340	1435340	hmm
1447260	1449260	Mm
1451180	1455740	There's no nine of our line and we need a record with the jukebox. I'm here with you, Lele
1463100	1468080	I was a little bit late to stream though.
1468080	1471020	I had to pee pee.
1471020	1480540	If I came all of a sudden I had to go.
1480540	1485260	Um, actually.
1485260	1495780	Could have been artificial meat maybe, but it was the lesses.
1495780	1498420	I don't care what it was.
1498420	1502620	Give me more of that and just don't tell me what it was because if you tell me it was
1502620	1519980	something crazy I'll probably be sick to my stomach.
1519980	1539420	Still better than Taco Bell meat?
1539420	1543980	You know, I had Taco Bell for the first time in like 5 years.
1543980	1546540	It was actually pretty good.
1547260	1553900	I had Taco Bell so long because I used to really fuck my stomach.
1553900	1555420	Really bad.
1555420	1562620	I destroyed my stomach, but I had it recently.
1562620	1564460	It was good.
1564460	1569020	It was really good, but I couldn't finish that quesadilla.
1569100	1574300	It was uh, too much.
1574300	1575980	Too much.
1575980	1581100	Too much my stomach, not until it.
1581100	1584060	I'm a big fan of soft tacos though.
1584060	1586060	I like a soft taco.
1586060	1592060	I'm traumatized by a hard taco because I remember biting into one and then like the shell like
1592140	1594300	shanked my gum.
1599340	1606700	I remember being in so much pain and I was like nah, I'm not eating a hard taco again.
1607820	1609420	It's horrible.
1609420	1617260	I have a bad experience.
1630620	1631900	It's true, I think so.
1631900	1632780	I believe so.
1633500	1640860	Oh my gosh, that reminds me of when I got food poisoning from Mickey D.
1642620	1646620	I had heavy food poisoning, twice.
1646860	1666300	I haven't eaten anything really, but this like chicken.
1668060	1670380	Hey, just like two pieces of chicken.
1670380	1672940	That was all I had today, nothing else.
1674780	1675660	And there's icy.
1676780	1677260	No.
1686860	1687660	No bread.
1687660	1688700	I'm all out of bread.
1691340	1692860	I'm all out of bread.
1694940	1696860	Only bread I have is this one right here.
1698060	1698540	I want.
1700940	1701580	One double.
1707180	1709900	Oh, can't reach it.
1710780	1711580	That's too far.
1719740	1720460	Yeah, twice.
1720460	1722380	I got food poisoning at Mickey D.
1723820	1729660	I ate 20 pieces of chicken nuggets, chicken nuggets.
1730380	1735500	I ate 20 pieces and the other time I had a 40 piece.
1737020	1739340	And then I got sick.
1740060	1749980	I went to bed and I was laying on the floor because I couldn't lay on the sofa at the time
1749980	1751260	because I didn't have the actual bed.
1751260	1752060	I had a sofa.
1755820	1762300	A family member was staying over so they took my sofa and they kept kicking me so I laid on the
1762300	1762940	floor.
1762940	1770140	I was on the floor and I was sleeping and then all of a sudden my stomach was hurting.
1770140	1772300	It woke me up, but I couldn't move.
1772300	1773740	I was like paralyzed.
1773740	1774380	I couldn't move.
1774380	1775420	I couldn't get up.
1775420	1776140	I was laying there.
1781420	1790140	I was on my stomach and I woke up and I was like my head up and I was like,
1790220	1792300	whoa, I can't, I can't move.
1792300	1793580	I gotta go to the bathroom.
1793580	1795420	I can't, I can't move.
1795420	1799580	And I was like, and I almost like choked.
1800300	1803660	I had to turn over to the side, like as hard as I could.
1803660	1806460	I had to force myself to turn to the side and I was just like,
1812780	1813660	it wouldn't stop.
1815740	1816540	It was horrible.
1820620	1834460	And then after that, I didn't have Mickey D's for like three years and then I had it again later on.
1837820	1838940	Everyone was eating it.
1839820	1842380	It was the only thing I could afford at the time.
1842380	1848540	They're not when they still have the dollar menus.
1852540	1853900	Yeah, no other choice.
1854620	1856460	I was a hungry.
1856460	1857660	I was a hungry.
1872540	1874540	Mmm.
1883980	1885740	Sweet and sour sauce is good.
1887340	1890300	I like the sauce for chimkin nuggets.
1894460	1900540	I had sweet and sour sauce with my nuggets.
1902380	1904380	Mmm.
1909660	1911820	I'm going to have one more drink.
1914220	1917740	Totally not alki-hole, nothing like that.
1919340	1922380	Oh, nope, nope, nope.
1925820	1928380	And then we'll play and we'll head on over to work.

4248740	4250740	Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!
4250740	4263380	this reminds me of when I was working um cashier I told you about the internet
4263380	4280420	about my finger right 90 dollars I can't I had to tell you about my finger yeah it
4280420	4287380	was a whole accident it was a big complete accident you know how so they
4287380	4296740	like they back then I don't know if they do it the same but you know how you know
4296740	4306100	how when um uh you would uh you work at the cashier but every employee had their
4306100	4316420	own um little banky so we would have to take it out we would take the whole thing
4316500	4323780	out and we'd take it with us to each register every time we go to a new register so we all
4323780	4331780	had our own little banky that we were in charge of and the finger in the safe yeah yeah that one
4333300	4340180	yeah so it would we so every time you would run out of money or something or something that you need
4340820	4347060	change for you'd give them the big bills and then they would go into the safe and give you like
4347620	4357860	smaller bills and stuff so that you can like give change to the customer and stuff and I
4358340	4365540	um they would take it expensive bye trevor bye bye
4374980	4383460	uh much money oh so they would like give you change that you would need to um
4383780	4394500	uh give give give to the customer and I went to go give get change and they put the bill
4394500	4401780	like on the edge on top of the safe while it was open and I went to grab it like I went to like
4401780	4412820	reach up to grab it and they closed the door of the safe like a giant metal safe
4415780	4422900	they closed it and it's not one where you put in a coat or anything they closed it on my finger
4422900	4430660	on my thumb because my thumb was hanging off you know like when you grab something you slide it
4430660	4436500	off slowly you could do it on the table right now and see how it is when you slide it grab it
4436500	4442900	and then you slide it so my thumb was hanging off of this of the safe and they closed it right on my
4442900	4455860	finger thank goodness she didn't um the uh they didn't close it all the way on my finger like it
4455860	4463300	didn't completely close or it probably would have been worse but they managed to open it back up
4464020	4474580	really quickly uh before it closed fully but my finger was shamushed it was split in two
4475140	4477620	hey the big two
4480180	4483460	hey and next day it was split in two
4496820	4503540	working there was a nightmare it was a nightmare do you have a scar I have a small one
4503620	4509460	it's tiny it's not very visible um they didn't even have like a first aid kit
4510180	4516980	and my boss was like just slap a bandaid on it and get back to work I was like oh okay
4518820	4523380	I was like I didn't scream or anything you know adrenaline rushed in and I was really I was the
4523380	4532020	calmest while everyone else was freaking out I was so calm super calm yeah
4532260	4539300	and then um I had to walk because they didn't want to call anyone to come get me so I had to walk to
4539300	4548260	the hospital on foot I had to walk I wish I knew I was really young so I wish I knew about you
4548260	4554820	know suing and stuff but two years already passed more than two years that's so long I don't like
4555060	4562820	it way more than two years has passed so I think there's like a you can't really uh
4563700	4570580	so anyone after two two two years I think it's the thingy so I didn't know what I just moved on
4570580	4576980	past it and ever since then I just hated that place they did more and more things that really
4576980	4584660	made me upset so I had to walk to the hospital and they got like uh they put like skin glue
4584740	4590580	on me uh and they had to like shift the finger they have to shift it
4592340	4599060	for it to realign itself and then they stuck it together they smushed it together and then they
4599060	4605780	put skin glue on it to keep it together
4606020	4606900	so
4610820	4612900	yeah
4616900	4622820	and then they healed they healed after that had a big old band-aid and a big old band-aid it was
4622820	4630900	like a big wrap around it
4636100	4636900	and
4639620	4644100	yeah I think that's it wasn't worse it could be like what happened to a what do you say
4645460	4651620	I don't got nothing else for you get out yeah we don't sell sugar maybe
4654020	4660900	I got some sort of sugar for you
4666500	4668900	ah
4676820	4682260	it could be worse it could have been worse with my finger because I think the person who got it
4682260	4689460	the worst was um a family member of mine we had a doggie
4689700	4701140	we had a doggie and doggie was tied to the door the front door and
4703700	4715620	and family member decided to open door with doggie still tied to door and doggie loves outdoor
4715620	4721460	loves outdoors you know loves out being outdoors and doggie slipped through the crack of the door
4722100	4724740	and pulled the door shut
4727620	4729540	and family member
4733860	4734740	lost finger
4737380	4740260	finger was hanging on by skin
4741060	4745620	um so it could have been worse
4753060	4758500	I remember being traumatized by that I had it took me a long a long time to get over that scene
4758500	4766580	that I saw I saw with my eyeballs it was like all over the wall it was red over the wall
4766580	4774740	specks and dots and yada yada it was a it was a very gruesome sight

6278880	6279880	I want to play Sonic.
6279880	6283880	I want to play the old Sonic.

6322880	6329880	I got it.
6329880	6330880	Excuse me.
6330880	6331880	I didn't hear that.
6331880	6335880	I think I got a, I think I got a, I think I just drank some water.
6335880	6337880	I think I just drank water.
6337880	6338880	Mmm.
6338880	6343880	I don't, I don't feel so good.
6343880	6350880	I don't feel so good.
6350880	6359880	I don't feel so good.
6359880	6368880	I don't feel so good.
6368880	6378880	Oh my gosh.
6378880	6385880	I hope that I found it.
6385880	6392880	I am feeling about, about to, I don't know.
6392880	6397880	It's a long line.
6397880	6398880	Oh boy.
6398880	6401880	We're fine.
6401880	6403880	I am okay.
6403880	6408880	I think I'm okay.
6408880	6410880	I drank a whole bottle.
6410880	6417880	An entire whole bottle of green grape soju.
6417880	6426880	I had a whole bottle.
6426880	6452880	The discovery of cheese was by accident and bit the first cheese to taste tested.
6452880	6457880	I was probably consumed because it's like, well, that milk was the only thing I had for food.
6457880	6459880	And then ate it for survival.
6459880	6460880	True.
6460880	6464880	I think that's probably what happened.
6464880	6466880	You know the first sonic?
6466880	6468880	You know the very first sonic?
6468880	6469880	Not the very first sonic.
6469880	6470880	You know the one.
6470880	6473880	Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
6473880	6481880	When you're underwater and you butt it down.
6481880	6483880	Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
6483880	6488880	I remember what sonic with that was.
6488880	6490880	That's the first one really?
6490880	6493880	I want to play that.
6493880	6497880	I want to play that.
6497880	6502880	That was like the best ADHD game ever.
6502880	6524640	I want to play that. It's not fair. Where is it? I can't find it anywhere. I don't think
6524640	6526640	we can play Sonic on stream though, I don't think.
6555440	6556080	Wasn't it?
6559840	6564240	Why not? I don't think we can even find that game. I don't think. I don't think you can really find
6564240	6570800	that. I don't think you're gonna be able to find that at all on PC. Give me.
6573760	6582000	So sorry. I'm a little gassy. I'm so sorry. Oh, so unclassy. So unladylike.
6582400	6583920	I'm a little gassy.
6583920	6585920	No
6609480	6611480	Oh
6613920	6619640	Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
6622640	6629120	Sonic 2? I like the Sonic games a lot. I used to play them a lot when I was a
6629120	6634920	kid. However, I wasn't allowed to play. I was second player. You know that kid
6634920	6643940	that had the remote control that wasn't actually plugged in. I was second
6643940	6657760	player. I wasn't allowed to play. But I was a pretty smart kid so I knew that I
6657760	6668120	wasn't playing the game. So I figured it out really fast. I didn't complain though.
6668120	6673320	Rest in peace. I'm God!
6687800	6690800	I'm back.
6695840	6698840	I'm back.
6717760	6737160	Gas! See, I wasn't passing that kind of gas. I was just belching. I was just belching.
6737160	6742920	What do you mean? I have a different sound. I was like lagging a little bit. Sorry, I'm
6742960	6758080	catching up. I did a little bit of crashy. You know, I still have my Xbox 360. I've
6758080	6767800	had it for years. I still have it and it works. I have a bunch of Xbox 360 games.
6768240	6781600	Let me see. Let me look up at my bookshelf. Left 4 Dead 2, Payday 2. Does that be
6781600	6792880	jeweled? I said Arkham, Arkham, Arkham, Arkham Asylum Batman. I have Assassin's Creed
6792880	6798840	Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed. What other Assassin's Creed? The first one?
6798840	6808440	Assassin's Creed 2. I have Sims, pets. Oh no, it's PC. That's a PC disc. Why is that
6808440	6819720	in the middle of there? I have BioShock, BioShock Infinite, Call of Duty Black Ops 2. I have
6819720	6832360	another Assassin's Creed. I think I bought two because one disc wasn't working. Assassin's
6832440	6845760	Creed 4? Is that what that says? Grand Theft Auto? Grand Theft Auto? Yeah. Then I have another
6845760	6852640	Call of Duty Black Ops 2 disc because the other one wasn't working. I have Destiny. I never really
6852640	6866320	played it. Destiny. Final Fantasy X2. And then everything else is GameCube games. A bunch of
6866320	6874600	GameCube games at PlayStation 2 games. I haven't been up there on that shelf in like four years.
6874960	6876720	Everything's just been sitting up there.
6894720	6900320	Yeah, my Xbox still works. I took kind of good care of it. I haven't received the red thing,
6900440	6907760	red ring of death yet. It's still good. Still working. My other one used to turn on by itself.
6907760	6915000	Actually, I think this is the one. If it's not unplugged, it turns on by itself. I don't know
6915000	6925600	why, but it turns on by itself. If you leave it plugged in, it will just turn on. I think that's
6925600	6934000	the only thing wrong with it. All my other games are long gone.
6943120	6947280	And then I have the Naruto Ultimate Ninja for PlayStation 2. I have all of them,
6947280	6952400	except for one because someone stole it. I had Chronicles as well.
6956560	6962160	I don't have four because I came out after I got the whole pack series.
6965520	6974480	Then I have Storm Chronicles as well. I have the first Sims and Sims 2.
6978080	6984640	I have the Brats. I remember getting that for my birthday long time ago. The Brats.
6985600	6992960	It was a really fun game for Gamecube and Road Rage, the Simpsons Road Rage. I have that too.
6994000	6994800	So enough there.
7000480	7008400	Yeah, games up there. Everything else broke, so everything else had to go in the trash.
7008400	7014880	A lot of CD discs broke. I had Super Smash Bros for Gamecube. Both discs broke.
7015440	7026560	My favorite Pokemon game was Colosseum. Pokemon Colosseum was my favorite one. Was it Pokemon
7026560	7041120	Colosseum? It was. Haha. It was my favorite Pokemon game. I played that on Gamecube.
7045840	7049120	I played that like five times before it broke.
7058480	7062640	A family member of mine thought that they could fix the Gamecube and they ended up
7062640	7067440	breaking it further by taking it apart, so I could never play it again. Then they broke the
7067440	7071440	discs to the Smash Bros and Colosseum.
7078640	7083360	Any Kirby? I didn't get to play Kirby. I was only allowed to watch, sadly.
7084640	7090320	I was a brokey growing up, so I could only get my hands on so much. The majority of the games
7090320	7094800	that I got was free. People who were done playing it and didn't want it anymore,
7095680	7102080	so I was very lucky to be able to play a lot of the games. I think there was this one scary game
7102080	7109040	with aliens or something on PlayStation 2. Extermination? I think it was called extermination.
7109040	7114320	I don't have that anymore either. I used to play that too. I think it was the only scary game that
7114320	7126000	I could stomach besides Resident Evil 6? Six and four? Or was it three? No, not three.
7128720	7130320	Which one's the one with silver in it?
7138240	7143040	Which one's that one? Which one was that one in Resident Evil?
7145200	7154880	Five? Resident Evil 5? Yeah, that's the one. I can only play Resident Evil 5 and 6. It wasn't
7154880	7162480	scary. It wasn't too scary for me. Don't have a lot of jump scares. Do I have a Wii? I do have a Wii.
7163440	7169440	My favorite game to play on the Wii was the Michael Jackson game. It kept me fit.
7170240	7174720	I knew all the dances, all the dance moves. I still do.
7179920	7186160	I remember playing the dance games on the Gamecube 2. We had the little dance pad,
7186160	7196880	the little plastic dance pad. You step on it. I remember that too. We had that too.
7199440	7212880	Good night to anyone heading to bed. Have a sweet dream. Thank you for stopping by. Appreciate you.
7229680	7238000	Is that real? It came with a Michael's glove? I think so. I don't remember.
7238800	7242080	I don't remember the glove. We had the game for so long. I don't remember.
7243760	7248400	It was really fun dancing to it. I would literally do that over stream.
7249920	7255200	But I don't think we can play any other songs on stream. I don't think. I don't think.
7259440	7267840	My first zombie game was Left 4 Dead. My first zombie game was Left 4 Dead too. I have it right up there.
7268480	7273360	That was my very first game that I played. It was Left 4 Dead.
7279200	7283040	Do you have Gamecube games to play it on? Do you have a Gamecube to play it on? No.
7284000	7292960	I no longer have one. I haven't had one for over 10 years. It's been 10 years.
7294960	7296720	I have one in a minute.
7300480	7301520	That was one in a minute.
7313520	7318240	I still have my remote controls though. I have an orange one and a gray one.
7318240	7320960	Had a purple one. I don't know where that went. Disappeared.
7322960	7325600	I still have my orange remote. It was my favorite remote.
7329680	7332640	Yeah, I still have it sitting right there.
7344000	7351360	Do I have Gamecube games? Yeah, I do. I have the Bratz and Road Rage. The Simpsons Road Rage.
7351920	7358560	Those are my only two Gamecube games I still have. I lost the Colosseum game. That was broken long time ago.
7360480	7363200	Oh, and I have the Michael Jackson game.
7363360	7376560	My mom is a little bit of a gamer, but I highly doubt that she'll let me touch her Mario game.
7381200	7384000	I do not think she'll let me touch it.
7384720	7392960	She bit me up.
7397280	7398960	Highly doubt she'll let me touch that.
7400880	7402240	She plays that like every day.
7408720	7413040	She plays her Super Mario game every day. I think they got the newest one too.
7414000	7440000	Oh, I forgot I was writing the story. I guess I'm golfing story time.
7444720	7451440	Ah, I have two milks, one bread.
7458320	7459920	I am via fritz now.
7462080	7472000	Purchase. I ran up with our cheese in it.
7474000	7488000	How much is she as? Oh, we can sell it for five dollars. She does it expensive. What the hell?
7504560	7508240	I missed the crabs now.
7517680	7522000	Yeah, Pokemon Colosseum is my favorite Pokemon game for a long time.
7522000	7546000	Ah, I'm starting to get hit with the sleeps. I'm going to eat me really fast. I feel so old.
7552000	7575120	I would love to play Left 4 Dead with the girls. That sounds so fun.
7575120	7586240	It's like a trip down memory lane. Like hardcore. Hardcore down memory lane.
7606000	7621280	Yeah, I remember. I remember playing Final Fantasy a long time ago.
7622240	7629120	I remember it like it was yesterday. I didn't have a bed. I didn't have a bed frame. I didn't own one.
7630080	7642960	I stopped on the floor. The hard floor. I remember. We had those big bulky TVs.
7643680	7653920	You know, the old TVs. Big bulky TVs. I had to play PlayStation 2.
7657120	7665520	That was the first time I got to play a game really, myself, to myself that I owned.
7666000	7682160	I remember I was given Final Fantasy X2 as a gift and I used to watch all the Final Fantasy games.
7682800	7687840	I really like Final Fantasy and I think someone in my family was like, I heard you like this game.
7687840	7694400	I don't know which one this is, but here's this one and it gave it to me and I played it.
7695520	7699360	I never got to finish that game. Never got to finish it.
7702000	7708880	There I got to finish it because the disc was scratched in a specific spot.
7710000	7713360	A really small specific spot was damaged on the disc.
7715600	7719840	So whenever I got near the ending of the game, it would freeze.
7720160	7727680	The crash and freeze. I'd start over mainly because I didn't have a memory disc.
7728240	7735120	So I had to play the game from the start because I didn't own a memory disc. All my other memory
7735120	7746080	discs were lost or stolen. So I started the game over from the start and I would play all the way
7746160	7750160	through because I thought maybe it was just an issue with something and I'd play it all the way
7750160	7756080	through and I'd get to that concert part. The concert. Never got to get to you.
7758720	7767440	Never got to you. And then the game crashes. I realized that it was just a scratch on the disc
7767520	7778560	and I was never going to be able to finish it. That was a good game though.
7782480	7788640	I did the same thing with Pokemon Colosseum as well. I finished the game and then someone
7789120	7798320	lent me their, I had the disc still. Someone lent me their Gamecube and I got to play the game but
7798320	7804960	I had to like zoom through it because I didn't have a memory disc. So I had to play it again
7805600	7814320	one last time. That person was very nice and I gave them back their Gamecube. I was very happy.
7819280	7828320	They lent me play one last time.
7828320	7845040	I was so excited to get my first job.
7845680	7854000	When I was crazy, my first job was actually this job. It was the job where I hurt my finger.
7854000	7860640	That was my very first job. My very first official job.
7865440	7874800	I was so happy. I bought so many things. I bought this disc that I still have but unfortunately
7874800	7878640	I messed up and I didn't realize that this disc was actually a dinner table.
7878640	7883440	This is why I have a dinner table disc.
7893040	7905280	So my clamp on for the for the my microphone stand thingy is like barely hanging on because
7905280	7911520	this is not properly clamped because the outside part like comes out.
7915280	7920960	That's why I added a desk on the the thingy. I think I mentioned this before how I just add
7921520	7928960	I add random things due to what I like experienced or went through. Like I could tell you a story
7929840	7934560	almost all the things I added onto that list of things on the throne.
7938720	7944560	So it was the first time I got that job and I started buying like I was saving up as much
7944560	7954960	about this desk. I bought me a like a bed frame my first bed frame. I was lent the mattress.
7954960	7959200	One gave me a mattress so I still have that mattress to this day.
7963200	7966160	I got my first dresser because I never had a dresser.
7968560	7975440	I had an old one and my cat used to sleep in it. He used to pull it open and he
7975440	7980720	will sleep at the bottom of it. I had a little table. I got my first TV.
7981440	7985760	All of that with this job and these bookshelves and stuff.
7988160	7992960	Then after that I saved up as much as possible and I got my first PC.
7995280	8001440	I broke my motherboard to that PC though. It was an accident. It was my first time really like
8001440	8009680	doing stuff with a PC. It was my very first time and I snapped my motherboard in half.
8011040	8029680	I didn't know about like unscrewing stuff and how to move stuff. I thought I unscrewed it
8029680	8035760	really well and I was like moving stuff and then I like pulled on it. I'm like maybe I have to like
8035760	8041600	pull on it a little more and I pulled on it and it's like I'm like
8066320	8074880	okay and then after that I broke. I got another PC and I broke my graphics card.
8076720	8081760	I yanked that out because the first one was really hard to come out so I thought it was
8081760	8088960	going to be the same for the next one and I just yanked it out and the part that's usually like
8089040	8095120	clamped in on the thingy came off and came off the graphics card.
8107600	8112080	And then the fans broke on it too so that's the reason why I was taking it out. I was
8112080	8117280	going to try and replace the fans but then it ended up where I had to replace the whole thing.
8119840	8130080	How expensive was that mistake? I was really broke so I had to, I was saving up a lot of
8130080	8136560	money to get new parts so I had to use the money that I was saving up to get a new computer which
8136560	8146800	only cost me like 800, 899 dollars. I got it on Black Friday. It was a Black Friday. I got it
8146800	8157120	right after Thanksgiving. I got it on a Black Friday. Well, Cyber Monday. They call it Cyber
8157120	8165120	Monday. It's people who can't really go out on Black Friday so yeah I got it like 899 dollars.
8166080	8172240	It was on sale. It was on sale. It was a really cheap computer.
8176800	8186080	I still got it though it's falling apart and it's what I was streaming with
8186960	8196000	before this for a while. I had to take off the glass because it was overheating and I needed
8196000	8205120	to put a fan and like facing it to blow on it. It was overheating really bad. My CPU was bad.
8205600	8214960	Everything was bad. It was falling apart. I still got it. I was really surprised.
8216720	8226240	I was really happy when Strony found me and Strony found me. I had like the worst equipment.
8226480	8235200	So when everyone says, when everyone's really confused about why my audio and everything's
8235200	8245680	so bad now, I had horrible equipment before this. I have no clue how to work this equipment.
8249040	8254960	I'm so new to using all this stuff. It's so technical. I'm just like
8256640	8264080	yeah yeah yeah yeah but I'm pretty nerdy and geeky in the sense where I like to study this
8264080	8272240	stuff so I watched a bunch of videos learning how to work stuff. I'm learning. It's going to take
8272240	8294000	me time though. I had the worst equipment. So I'm very happy. Strony saved me.
8294160	8306800	Literally just before, just before things went down and I got the email. Two of my fans stopped
8306800	8319600	working. Two of my fans stopped working. The fans on my graphics card. One of the fans wouldn't spin.
8320400	8325920	She has saved me. She has saved me.
8337360	8338880	She sent me up really good.
8342240	8347680	My monitors were like breaking slowly. The color in the monitors were leaving.
8349600	8358240	It was bad. I was the brokest of the brokest. I have tape on everything. I currently have tape
8358240	8363520	on my chair. She can only help me put so much. I think I mentioned this.
8371280	8373360	She can only help me put so much.
8380160	8385840	My milk is really selling. I really like my milk.
8392640	8393280	All milk.

8661040	8668400	when you're not all up there in the head. This is a great game to play especially when you're not
8668400	8674560	all up there in the head. You just relax and play this game and enjoy your time.
8677840	8685040	Look at your shirt. I want to touch his forehead. It looks like it looks like it'll be soft.

8862280	8863920	head for too long?
8863920	8869760	And here's my headphones.
8869760	8875320	They, like, squishing my head.

8905200	8907640	Oh my god.
8907640	8909800	Oh, I hate clothes.
8909800	8910840	Why wear clothes?
8910840	8913280	Clothes is unnecessary.
8913280	8916000	You don't need a...
8916000	8918800	Oh.
8918800	8921640	Oh.

8943000	8944360	You don't understand.
8944400	8950000	If you guys didn't help me get this fan, I would have been melting in here.
8950000	8956240	Like, like, this is what I was used to, this is what I had to deal with.
8956240	8961760	I would sweat, like, no tomorrow, and I usually don't sweat.
8961760	8968600	I sweat in random places, like, the bitties and stuff, you know?
8968600	8972120	It would sweat, like, crazy.
8972120	8973680	And my armpit, and that's it.
8973680	8974920	I wouldn't sweat anywhere else.
8974920	8976400	My forehead, don't sweat.
8976400	8980920	I'm dry everywhere else.
8980920	8991320	So I don't know why, but I sweat everywhere else, like, under the bubba, under bubba, would
8991320	8993120	sweat, crazy.
9003120	9009120	It gets so hot in here.
9009120	9018120	Oh, man.
9018120	9030480	Well, I kind of, like, technically I suffer from headaches 24-7, so I'm, like, it could
9030480	9039000	just be, like, a, you know, like, an addition, you know what I mean?
9039000	9050160	Like, an addition, an additional pain, since, you know, I suffer from headaches all the time.
9050160	9057160	So, like, the combination of the half-ones and everything else just, like, sucks.
9057840	9059840	Well.

9416380	9419380	I'm hungry and I haven't really eaten anything
9419380	9420820	except for this chicken.
9422500	9424380	And my stomach is like,
9426260	9428460	growling at me right now.
9438540	9439660	I'm really hungry.
9443100	9448100	I wanna order food, but I don't think it's a wise idea.
9449300	9451340	I got the bill leaves coming up.
9452820	9454380	I got the bills coming up.
9456460	9461460	And my, my mama Dulay left again.
9462820	9467820	She left, she's not here again, so I'm gonna starve.
9472020	9474180	My source of food is gone.
9486300	9491300	You stand in your shower, not me.
9500060	9502260	I sit in my shower like a psychopath.
9516780	9521740	I can't stand for long.
9521740	9525100	I can't even stand for longer than like 10 minutes, bro.
9525100	9528900	My spine hurts, I guess it's down.
9528900	9531140	I sit down and I let it run on me like,
9533540	9538220	a blasting hot boiling water right on my chest.
9546860	9551860	The water feels so good, it makes my legs wobble.
9551860	9553180	So I gotta sit down.
9556100	9556940	Go sit down.
9559020	9560940	Yo, my stomach is like,
9565900	9569540	I wish I could like, I wish you could like hear it.
9569540	9572420	I wish I could like bring you to it so you could hear it.
9572420	9574060	It is going.
9577140	9579900	I ate some cereal.
9579900	9582060	Maybe that'll just sum up my hunger.
9583460	9584620	I ate some cereal.
9590620	9591900	Yeah, here it goes.
9596380	9597220	Ah, no!
9597220	9598060	Ah, I got it.
9599340	9602620	Can't waste a single piece of cereal.
9603620	9607940	We brokeie brokeie, we can't waste a single piece.
9607940	9609180	It almost fell.
9633620	9634460	Mm.
9641060	9643220	Sitting in the shower is nasty work.
9643220	9645700	Hey, I cleaned the shower.
9645700	9648740	I wiped that, that I've wiped that bitch down real good,
9648740	9649580	all right?
9649580	9653620	If I clean it, it's clean enough for me, all right?
9653620	9654940	I have OCD.
9657780	9659620	Whoa, thank you, thank you so much
9659620	9662220	for the food all the time, thank you, thank you.
9663620	9666980	If I clean my shower, it's clean, all right?
9666980	9668860	I understand how people feel though,
9668860	9671580	about not wanting to shower in other people's showers.
9673060	9674140	Feel a little dirty.
9675460	9677060	I know that feeling.
9677060	9679340	My shower is good, right?
9679340	9680300	I clean it.
9683540	9685580	The bathroom is like my safe haven.
9687380	9689140	I spend the most time on there.
9690620	9691460	Oh, yeah.
9693260	9695980	I sit on a toilet watching memes for like,
9695980	9697980	for like three hours.
9700460	9701300	Oh.
9701300	9702140	Oh.
9703140	9703980	Mm-hmm.
9714140	9714980	Mm-hmm.
9720420	9721260	Mm-hmm.
9725260	9726100	Oh.
9728180	9729540	I didn't think about life.
9729540	9731300	I bring my phone with me.
9731300	9733620	I'm really sad when I forget my phone.
9736340	9740980	I get really sad, I'm like, no, no memes.
9740980	9741820	No.
9742020	9742860	Mm-hmm.
9748180	9750940	I know you start reading stuff off of like,
9750940	9753780	bottles, ingredients off the bottles.
9755140	9755980	Mm-hmm.
9756060	9756900	Mm-hmm.
9768820	9770420	Showering in other people's showers
9770420	9771820	is how you get foot fungus?
9771820	9772660	Ew.
9776100	9778100	You ain't gonna get that in my shower.
9778100	9781380	Not with my family's OCD.
9786980	9789220	You know how many times a week my,
9791380	9792220	my,
9795220	9797060	mama delay cleans?
9797060	9798460	Do you know how many times?
9800380	9802580	Yeah, I don't think you have to worry about foot fungus.
9804580	9805420	Mm-hmm.
9815980	9816820	Mm-hmm.
9824500	9828020	No, I think it's an average amount of time that you clean.
9833420	9834260	Mm-hmm.
9838380	9840700	She cleans every time she uses it.
9840700	9843660	Every time she uses the bathroom, she cleans it.
9843660	9844500	No.
9853100	9854340	I do the same thing.
9854340	9856100	I also clean it before I use it.
9857180	9859060	I wipe the seat down.
9859060	9862340	I don't want my poor, soft, sensitive skin touching the
9862340	9864100	seats that someone else sat on.
9868100	9869020	I'm nervous.
9870060	9872600	So I clean it every time before I sit on it.
9873660	9874500	Mm-hmm.
9884780	9886100	Mm.
9886100	9887780	Thank you, thank you for the $2 to help.
9887780	9889660	Thank you, I'm not a mouse.
9889660	9890500	Thank you.
9902460	9903620	Mm-hmm.
9903620	9904780	Thank you, thank you.
9904780	9905620	Mm-hmm.
9908380	9909220	Oh.
9914820	9917860	Thinking about life as reserve for the shower.
9917860	9920300	I think about some ratchet things in the shower.
9920620	9921460	Mm-hmm.
9921460	9922300	Mm-hmm.
9927940	9929820	My imagination runs wild.
9931340	9932180	Mm-hmm.
9934620	9937620	Sometimes I even bring my iPad with me.
9937620	9939940	iPad and put it on a little stand.
9939940	9942420	And I watch things in the shower.
9942420	9943260	Mm-hmm.
9958140	9960020	Yes, you may, you may use my lap.
9960540	9961740	You can use my lap.
9961740	9963140	I'm always sitting in chat.
9972340	9973180	Mm-hmm.
9979180	9980020	Mm-hmm.
9990020	9990860	Mm-hmm.
9999020	9999860	Mm-hmm.
10003700	10004540	Mm-hmm.
10004540	10006460	Shower iPad is wild.
10006460	10007300	Oh, man.
10009220	10011260	Man, I'm bored, I get bored.
10012380	10014660	Did you get bored taking a shower?
10014660	10016860	I'm bored, I gotta bring some entertainment.
10016860	10017700	Oh, man.
10017700	10019780	I'm bored, I gotta bring some entertainment.
10019780	10020620	Oh.
10020620	10021460	Oh, man.
10039460	10042020	Clearly, she means she watches my hero academia.
10042020	10043460	I do.
10043460	10044940	But not on the iPad.
10047700	10048540	Mm-hmm.
10062540	10063620	I mean my cereal.
10065660	10067060	That's actually really good.
10068140	10069740	Tasted really good.
10069740	10071740	I'm running out of cereal.
10071740	10072580	No.
10077700	10078540	Mm-hmm.
10090620	10092340	I always play music while I shower,
10092340	10094620	so I don't have to think about life.
10094620	10096220	Music isn't enough for me.
10097580	10100060	Music, I resonate with music too much
10100060	10104780	that it puts me in the, it makes me think sometimes.
10104780	10107500	So instead, I gotta dance in the shower
10107540	10108820	while playing music.
10112100	10115820	But sometimes, because my range in music is so broad,
10116700	10118780	if I play with songs on shuffle,
10118780	10121420	there's a high chance I'm gonna get hit with a sad song.
10121420	10122540	And I don't want that song.
10124340	10126100	I already had that happen twice.
10127540	10128780	And I said to myself,
10128780	10131780	I am not gonna play music, it's a shower anymore.
10132780	10138580	I had me sad, and it had me feeling like Vegeta in the rain.
10143940	10146100	That Vegeta gift in the rain.
10162620	10164500	You scared to put your electronics in your water?
10164500	10165740	Just get a little cover.
10165740	10167100	Get a water cover.
10167100	10168900	Protect your electronics.
10169900	10170740	It'll be fine.
10170740	10171580	Mm-hmm.
10174740	10175580	No!
10176580	10178380	I dropped some cereal.
10178380	10179220	No!
10188220	10189060	Mm-hmm.
10191780	10192620	Mm-hmm.
10202100	10205180	I watched anime in the shower.
10205180	10206020	I'd do them.
10206860	10209620	I even watched a movie in the shower.
10209620	10210460	Mm-hmm.
10210460	10211300	Mm-hmm.
10222620	10223460	Mm-hmm.
10226620	10227900	That's why you gotta make a playlist
10227900	10229980	for specific moods.
10233140	10234860	I'm too organized that
10237580	10238940	my playlists are like
10240460	10241380	emo,
10243060	10243900	rock,
10246900	10248660	Japanese openings,
10249540	10250660	and songs.
10252140	10253060	K-pop.
10254460	10255300	R&B.
10266700	10268380	My playlist is too broad.
10269500	10270340	I can't do that,
10270340	10273660	because then one day I'm gonna be listening to rock,
10273660	10274500	and I'm like,
10275860	10277140	and then I'm gonna be like,
10277140	10279300	well, I wanna listen to this specific song
10279300	10280940	that's also kind of rock-ish,
10280940	10281900	but it's not rock-ish.
10281900	10283180	It's in the Japanese playlist.
10283180	10284660	Now I gotta go to the Japanese playlist
10284660	10285820	and you'll find the song.
10286820	10287860	Just to play the song.
10287860	10290100	That's why I just leave everything on shuffle.
10290100	10290940	Mm-hmm.
10293300	10294580	Just leave it on shuffle.
10306380	10308780	Do I listen to blues rock music?
10308780	10310220	I think so.
10310220	10311140	Sometimes.
10312740	10313780	What's cereal you're eating?
10313780	10315020	My favorite kind.
10316860	10318140	Captain Crunch,
10318140	10319020	peanut butter.
10334140	10336260	I'm not pouring another bowl.
10336260	10338340	I didn't eat the other one really fast.
10338340	10340260	I don't know what you're talking about.
10340260	10342100	This is only my second bowl.
10342100	10342940	Right?
10361860	10363380	I like cinnamon toast crunch,
10363380	10364220	but...
10365220	10368660	Okay, let's see it this way.
10368660	10372620	Imagine eating something for three years straight.
10372620	10373620	The same thing.
10373620	10375820	Nothing else, nothing new.
10375820	10377300	Three years straight.
10377300	10378660	The same thing.
10378660	10383660	Over and over and over and over and over and over again.
10385580	10387380	Are you not gonna get tired of it?
10388940	10391740	Cinnamon toast crunch used to be my favorite cereal
10391740	10392660	in the past.
10395060	10399540	But it was all my mom ever bought.
10403580	10405820	So I got tired of it really fast.
10424860	10425820	Three years straight.
10427860	10429260	It was all we could afford.
10431060	10432300	All the other brands were,
10432300	10434300	or stuff were a little more expensive.
10435700	10437460	But we couldn't get anything else.
10439220	10442980	She would only buy that and Lucky Charms.
10442980	10444860	But we weren't allowed to eat the Lucky Charms.
10444860	10446860	They were hers and hers alone.
10447900	10448860	Oh, we ate Lucky Charms.
10448860	10449820	You'd get angry.
10454620	10457140	Sorry I have a lot of aunties within my class.
10462340	10463940	I would star in an ice cream bar,
10463940	10464500	a hit sparkling tea bar
10464500	10465660	or a social television bar,
10465660	10467660	too stupid to be an ice cream lover.
10467700	10471660	I would be an ice cream lover if they'd offered me ice cream.
10472460	10473620	Friends would do that,
10473620	10474980	without 보이 rice and other cereals.
10477820	10479340	Three, four, three, four.
10479340	10480220	Let's go.
10484220	10486220	How long was your longest shower?
10488140	10490340	Five hours I fell asleep. I
10491860	10494500	Fell asleep then slid down and almost drowned
10514220	10518980	It woke me up there's a great big splash to the face
10544820	10546820	I
10549780	10551780	Rice is different though
10552220	10556460	You ate rice for 22 years rice is different. I fucking love rice
10556460	10562260	I don't think I'll ever get tired of rice. You could do so many things with rice so many different combinations with rice
10562260	10564260	Rice is like the best the best thing ever
10565100	10567820	People talk down a white rice. Right rice is amazing
10567820	10569820	A little bit of salt
10572500	10575540	Me some rice fried rice work rice
10577620	10579620	All the rice
10579780	10583940	Rice and peas rice and beans rice rice rice rice rice rice rice
10585980	10589340	That's literally why I put a rice cooker on my throat
10598660	10604380	My family has a rice cooker, but I'm not allowed to use it
10606380	10608900	I'm not allowed to use the the rice cooker
10613900	10618980	It's cuz I have really bad memory my memory is really really really bad and
10623060	10627220	My my mom wasn't aware that if you leave the rice cooker closed
10628020	10631220	Insealed the rice is still good for the next day
10632580	10634580	It's still good for the next day
10635220	10639660	But she kept opening it and then leaving it open
10640460	10643500	And then complaining that there was mold on it
10644060	10646060	I
10654260	10662580	So I had a teacher to stop opening it and leaving it open but because of the whole situation medication time
10673660	10679340	My alarm went off medication time
10681100	10684140	But I had to teach her not to open it and stuff
10684700	10690260	But because of the whole situation it took me like months to teach her not to do it or touch it or whatever
10691220	10697260	When she started doing it and leaving it closed. I thought that she was cleaning it out and
10697980	10700020	I would forget about it
10700940	10705260	I would completely forget about it. So I'd leave it in there for like days
10707060	10709060	Until it was time for me to use it again
10711380	10713700	So the rice was still in the collecting mold
10726780	10729820	So yeah, I would forget about it being in there
10730140	10732140	and then I would collect mold
10736340	10740340	But it's different if the rice cooker belonged to me and only me
10740340	10745340	I'd freely be able to eat out of it save food and I have to worry about people touching it
10745340	10751020	If no one's touching it then I can I will know when something's in it and when something isn't in it
10751580	10753580	And I would solely clean it myself
10760420	10763900	It was just really annoying because she would like
10765500	10767500	She would like take a picture
10768220	10772260	Send it to me, but like hey look it's moldy
10773900	10779140	Am I okay? Right? I'm gonna clean it. Clean it
10781500	10784540	And she just keep doing that over and over
10784940	10791260	Even if someone else used it, I had to clean it. So it was annoying. It was very annoying
10800580	10809760	To constantly be annoyed by it my brain just automatically like just no longer cared about it anymore
10810200	10812200	I
10812480	10814480	Stressed out over a rice cooker
10818320	10824360	I was like I'll forget about it. I just won't eat rice won't make my own rice anymore
10826760	10829640	After a rice is good for fried white rice, it's true
10840400	10842900	I'm right so bad
10849680	10851680	You met a cereal by the way
10860160	10866560	You had fried chicken and fried rice for dinner nice. I only had fried chicken, but it wasn't for dinner
10867280	10868880	sadly
10868880	10870880	It was for lunch
10873920	10875920	My mom made it before she left
10885560	10892560	Excuse me to talk about rice. Rice is amazing. What? You don't have time to talk about rice
10898880	10900880	I
10911600	10913600	Don't realize
10928960	10932120	I think the most food traumatizing thing
10932760	10938020	That my mom did was forced me to eat mushrooms. It's one of the reasons why I don't like mushrooms
10938520	10940880	I'm a little traumatized from mushrooms
10943240	10945240	So I really don't like mushrooms
10946560	10950360	She would make us eat it we were broke II so she would force us to eat
10952240	10955400	One thing she'd would make was you know spaghetti and meatballs
10956400	10961480	Spaghetti and meatballs minus the meatball replace it with mushrooms
10962920	10964920	She'd make that all the time
10967280	10971400	All the time and I can't I can't I can't no
10972680	10974680	No
10985400	10987400	Oh
10998440	11003000	She would get so angry we wouldn't finish our food she'd make us stay up at the table
11003640	11008360	We have to sit there and she was like you can't leave you can't go to bed unless you finish this
11009080	11014760	Me and my my siblings
11018280	11021800	We were such bad children ah
11025560	11030000	We would find multiple ways to dispose of the evidence
11038600	11040600	Oh
11052760	11060680	No, we chuck it chuck it out the window we hide it we'll flush it
11068360	11070360	So bad
11088360	11090360	Oh man
11090360	11092360	Oh
11099800	11105400	We used to be such food wasters things changed after that
11108120	11110120	Things changed so much
11112680	11115080	I remember being um
11115160	11122120	We were like I experienced true starvation for the first time
11122840	11124840	We were homeless for a little bit
11125560	11127560	For a little bit we were homeless
11128120	11129400	Yeah
11129400	11131400	Yeah, like a big dead
11131720	11133720	We're homeless
11133800	11135800	I've been homeless before
11135880	11137160	So I know
11137160	11139160	I'm gonna have a big tail and
11139640	11141640	We won't eat for
11142200	11143960	For so long
11144040	11146040	And all I would eat was bread
11146040	11149400	Bread bread. I love bread. It's my savior
11151240	11153240	Uh
11153480	11158600	I felt so bad about how much food I wasted in the past
11161800	11163800	Makes you really think
11168280	11170680	I'm not out of the clear water yet
11171640	11174200	I'm barely hanging on with rent
11177080	11179080	We're barely hanging on
11181480	11184360	But hopefully you're hopefully it won't happen again
11186120	11188120	We're fine now
11188600	11190600	For now
11190600	11192600	I
11199240	11205400	Thank you appreciate that. That's very sweet of you to say about my love. Thank you
11210520	11213480	They were chopped mushrooms by the way
11220840	11227000	Is it a flavor thing or texture thing? No, it's just trauma. I think it's just trauma
11228920	11230920	Uh mental mental thing
11233400	11238040	I get really nauseous whenever I try to eat a mushroom every now and then
11239960	11244760	They're really nauseous even if I eat it and I don't know what's a mushroom. It's like
11245800	11248120	It's like a taste you can't really forget
11250840	11252840	So I think it's just a mental thing
11253800	11258600	Same goes for raisins. I used to really like raisins a lot growing up
11259320	11261320	but again trauma
11261800	11268680	My grandma my grandma's house when I stayed with her she had a mice and stuff and
11269400	11271400	bugs infestation and
11272920	11274920	Wasn't like extremely bad, but
11277160	11279160	Her food was not safe
11280040	11281880	um
11281880	11284280	I think flies got into the
11285240	11286600	raisins
11286600	11288600	And I was eating them
11288920	11294760	Eating the box of raisins. It's just enjoying them. Hmm raisins. Yum. Yum. Yum. So good. Hmm
11295640	11298360	And then I poured out the last little bit into my hand
11299400	11303640	And there were about four maggots in my hand
11303880	11305880	And
11307400	11309400	Swiggling about in my hand
11311480	11313480	And ever since then I never ate raisins
11334520	11339080	You let an interesting life, I guess I suppose so
11341480	11343480	I've been through quite a lot
11363880	11365880	I
11371320	11375560	Have like so many stories I can tell you guys I have I have
11376280	11379320	I've been through quite a bit and they're very memorable
11380440	11382440	I remember stuff when I was five
11383240	11388200	I was five years old. I remember stuff way back then a lot of memories
11389160	11394600	I remember it's pretty good when it comes to remembering the really really good and the really really bad
11396520	11398520	But it's not good for much anything else
11400840	11404360	It has to have a stain on my brain for me to remember
11404440	11406440	I
11413240	11418200	Give me the elevator perch for your weirdest stories mention them speaking of elevators
11420760	11426520	Speaking of elevators, I have a bunch of elevator story for you
11434920	11436920	I
11442520	11449880	Didn't get stuck in an elevator that's old news. Come on. Everybody has had had gone. They had been stuck. Wow
11453080	11455080	Wow
11455560	11457560	Wow
11457960	11463240	English English is great
11466840	11471240	Everyone's gone stuck in an elevator at least once at least once
11473800	11475800	I got stuck in an elevator twice
11477480	11479480	twice
11480760	11483160	I was really really really young when the first time it happened
11483880	11489400	And there was a blackout and the elevator stopped working the blackout in the building and the elevator stopped working
11490440	11494040	So it was dark in the elevator. I remember being in an elevator with other people
11494120	11499160	I didn't really know what was happening. I was confused. So I was like, what's happening? Why is it so dark? And then
11500440	11502440	I was in an elevator with like a
11503240	11506440	family member and they were screaming at the top foot there
11506520	11513640	And that is what scared me. I'm actually really terrified of the dark and terrified of elevators
11515240	11523480	All right, let me put on details more details. It's not just elevators. I'm afraid of I'm afraid of man-made machinery
11526840	11534120	Man-made machinery that can and will mount function as what I'm afraid of I have a fear of machines
11536520	11539720	But I have no other choice but to use them. So I tough through it
11540200	11544120	I tough through it. I'm also claustrophobic. So yeah
11547320	11549320	Yes, I'm scared of escalators as well
11549960	11554440	I get shaky knees when I'm on them, but I have no other choice. I'm also afraid of planes
11555160	11556920	I'm afraid of planes
11556920	11558600	I'm not
11558600	11560440	super afraid of cars
11560440	11562440	But I I do
11563400	11569240	Get really really sick. I don't know if it's motion sickness, but I doubt it because I've been on a boat
11570280	11575880	I don't think it's motion sickness. I think I just get car sick the smell of the car
11576520	11580120	Being in it feeling closed off
11581560	11583560	I uh
11585000	11587000	Oh, I'm sorry give me a second
11588280	11589720	Wow
11589720	11591720	Even thinking about it makes me freak out
11593080	11594520	a little
11594520	11599240	Panic attack and then I uh, I get really nauseous and I really massive headache
11600520	11602520	Massive really big
11604200	11607240	So the only way I could ride in a car is if I uh
11614920	11616920	If I have a window open
11616920	11618920	I
11620440	11622600	But I tough through it usually I don't say anything
11622600	11627400	I sit in the car really quietly and I like lean my head against the door and I don't say anything
11628120	11632520	I don't want no one to worry or freak out and stuff the last time I brought it up to
11632920	11637880	It was like I was in a cab and the person in the cab freaked out because I was like panicking
11638120	11642840	I was like, please please can you open a window and they were like, it's cold. I was like, please please
11643080	11645080	Please please please please and they were like
11645880	11648680	And then I freaked out and then I freaked out and then we were freaking out
11650760	11652760	So I just don't say anything
11660680	11666440	I know what I don't want I don't want I don't want to freak out my hands are shaking. Oh my gosh
11673480	11677640	And I think I've been in a near accident in a car before
11678120	11682280	I've been in an accident twice, but the other one wasn't that bad, but I think it was like
11683160	11687400	Uh, one of my family members kind of scared me
11688360	11690680	They were like, oh, we got to be careful. We got to be careful
11691640	11696920	We're all gonna be doomed and oh it's gonna be over and then she started doing a prayer and I was like, oh my god
11697080	11699080	I'm going to die
11699080	11701080	Oh
11729400	11731400	Oh
11742200	11747640	But yeah, I've been stuck at elevator a couple of times, but I think the funny elevator stories I have for you
11748040	11750040	Don't have to really deal with these
11750040	11752040	It's just

11942760	11949320	And she sits flying and she's screaming and she's screaming
11972840	11981400	And she starts clinging to this poor man

12590360	12592360	He
12600600	12602600	Hate mosquitoes
12604440	12605960	I like
12605960	12611960	Some spiders, but I'm actually really scared of spiders, but I think some of them are really cute
12612520	12617400	I think jumping spiders and tarantulas are the cutest things that they're so fuzzy so dangerous
12617720	12619720	But so fuzzy and cute
12621160	12625960	Look at that. So cute. I like jumping spiders. I think the big beady eyes are as little
12628600	12630600	Big eyes
12631320	12633320	They're really cute
12634120	12636120	But I am still scared of
12636120	12641320	Spiders I leave the house spiders alone. I used to have a spider friend in the corner of my room
12641320	12643320	But I haven't seen it in a while
12644280	12648520	Um, it usually like disappears for a few days and then comes back in the same corner
12649000	12651480	But it's been gone for like two weeks now
12652840	12655320	Probably moved on to new endeavors
12661080	12665000	But I had spider scares where a spider would appear in my showers
12665960	12670600	Like uh fall down. I've had a spear fear of spiders for a while
12673480	12675480	And
12694920	12698920	Yeah, I usually take them out of the house too and put them out in the window
12699400	12701400	Yeah, go away little spider
12702360	12704360	Goodbye
12704760	12709800	But I don't do it. I get someone else to do it because I'm not gonna do it. I'm not going nowhere near one
12713240	12717320	Same goes for fireflies. I'm just really I just don't I'm not a big bug person
12718200	12720200	I'm not a big bug person
12722840	12730840	Like I like fireflies they look so pretty and I'm sure they're very they're harmless, but they're terrifying
12732360	12734360	They move around so much
12755160	12758840	I think spiders are fine though. I really like snakes and all those stuff
12759240	12761960	But the fire is okay some of them
12763240	12765240	If they look scary, I don't like them
12765800	12772760	But if they look big like they're cute and fuzzy and stuff, then that's fine. I like those the big fuzzy big fuzzy ones
12774120	12776120	I think those are cute
12776120	12778120	You
12783560	12788680	Would not believe your eyes is 10 million fireflies lit up the world
12798680	12800680	Stare
12806120	12808120	I
12815720	12823400	Fireflies big some depends there's multiple different types of fireflies and the ones over here pretty pretty fucking big
12824360	12827320	But I think they're like going extinct over here
12828200	12831400	Haven't really had many for the last couple of years
12833000	12835000	Yeah, they kind of like show up and then
12836120	12838120	Be no more
12839880	12841880	There's less and less every year
12857880	12859880	I make my stomach hurt
12860600	12862600	Oh
12864280	12868920	Road-sized fireflies. Oh my stomach
12872200	12874600	No, please no, no
12885400	12889000	We had a nice chat today. It was a nice chatting
12890200	12892200	You guys are pretty chill
12900040	12905240	Yeah, yeah, there's a little behaved but you're good boys and girls in here
12905960	12907960	Ah
12916200	12922280	My throat is starting to hurt. I don't remember if I took my medication if I'm honest
12925160	12932200	I mentioned my alarm and then I mentioned my medication, but I do not remember if I took it
12935400	12937400	I
12943000	12945000	Can't take the
12949960	12952440	I can't take the heart medication because I did drink
12953880	12959400	And I'm uh, I don't want to take chances. So we're not going to take that for today. It's okay to miss a day
12960360	12962360	It's perfectly fine. I miss a day, but the
12963480	12967080	Pankillers I need it would make if I didn't take my
12967800	12972040	If I didn't take the painkillers, it would make sense why I have a massive like
12973000	12975000	The robbing like headache on a side
12989880	12991880	I
12993560	12995560	Feel like I did
12996680	12998680	That's a myth
12999320	13001320	I remember taking something
13002280	13004280	I remember taking something
13005160	13007160	I think I did
13008280	13014280	I think I did I did I did I 100% did I did
13020120	13022120	I
13023960	13028600	Did not take my inhaler though that I did not take that's for sure
13032280	13035960	I think I did take it immediately. I have my memory is just so bad
13050280	13058120	And I don't need to take my nasal spray today. I took it earlier in the day because I was having those problems earlier
13062040	13065400	That's it, you know, I think I'm good. I think it's fine. Yeah
