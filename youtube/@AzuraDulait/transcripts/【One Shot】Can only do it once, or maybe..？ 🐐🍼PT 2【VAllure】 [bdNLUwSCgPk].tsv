1647080	1651080	i'm still a little bit upset though i guess i'm a little still upset
1651800	1659080	i want to see i want to see violence i want to see fighting i want to see blood murder
1670080	1679080	you know i want to see that i want to see that it's none of that it's none of that it's not fair
1685080	1692200	it's not much talking it's actually some action it's pretty pretty actiony right now in the last two episodes yeah
1692840	1702200	pretty actiony but just not the action that i i was expecting i'll put it that way
1714600	1720120	it's definitely not what i was expecting it was expecting more a little more than what they gave us
1720680	1722120	what they provided us
1728440	1745800	i i like tower of god don't get me wrong i've read the comic the comic is amazing
1746680	1755480	great comic i do not like the anime anime was trash
1757880	1766840	the animation amazing but the pacing they ruined it they removed so much plot
1766840	1773720	that it was unnecessary where's the plot they removed so much they changed stuff to make it fit
1774360	1783400	and it and it didn't make sense i don't i like the comic it's really good anime it's really bad
1792600	1797800	no hate towards it it's really good you should read it it's really good
1798120	1806440	it's not gonna be no season two it got a lot of hate got a lot of hate i'd be surprised if
1806440	1813560	there was a season two honestly if there is i'm surprised i'd be there's no season
1828120	1836120	my expectations i've been lowered now
1843000	1847640	it skips a lot it's the same thing with um what anime was that
1847800	1855960	that school school of god oh brain come on brain you got this
1863240	1864440	i can't nope can't think of it
1864840	1870760	but
1876360	1886760	the god of high school ha ha hey got it yeah yeah brain yeah
1894440	1902760	ha ha
1903960	1907880	and the same goes for the god of high school they changed quite a bit in there too they mushed
1907880	1914600	a lot of episodes together they they ruined the plot in there as well in the anime comic amazing
1914600	1921160	i i read up to like there's like i read up to like 600 chapters i i lost track
1921480	1927720	but it was really good it was really good really good comic it derails a lot sometimes
1927720	1934840	but hey it's all right but they mushed so much together they mushed so much together
1934840	1940600	they look mashing and it ruined it for me so i didn't want to watch it plus the opening is really
1940600	1946840	weird i know a lot of people like idiom i love idiom i don't get me wrong i love idiom i love a lot
1947800	1950360	i like that want want you know you know
1959400	1967160	but the the opening does not match the theme of the anime itself it was really weird
1967880	1976280	combination so i couldn't really get into it like i really like music so like an anime theme music
1976280	1984760	needs to like really really really like draw me and draw me and take me and
1984760	1989720	take me take me take me take me you know but it didn't take me it didn't take me at all
1990840	1997400	then like it didn't like it not one bit it was a good song though it would have been really good for
1997400	2006600	like a like a like a mecca anime or a or like a half kind of like android-y like futuristic kind of anime
2006600	2013400	you know it would have been really nice for that like it would have got you really in it like oh it's crazy
2013400	2025560	i like that i like that i like that so much yeah yeah oh yeah yeah sort of like sci-fi yeah
2027480	2035160	but uh it wasn't it wasn't like that it didn't fit the theme of the anime at all so i couldn't get into it
2042920	2047560	you've been watching this house needs a classroom yeah it's good i like it i even like the
2047560	2054040	second season i think they did a really good job with uh each season i like it it's really good
2054600	2061160	they really and they don't derail from the plot like even them even the filler episodes are still like
2062120	2067240	with the plot of the anime itself so yeah it's all funny and they're all fun and games and
2067240	2073720	ha ha he but it doesn't like you don't lose the story it doesn't become like a random filler
2073720	2079720	whereas like random the plot still stays the same so it's really good
2080360	2088200	yeah it's the alien the yellow alien teacher yeah yeah yeah
2092840	2099560	oh i love trigon um i really do who's one of my favorite one of my favorite
2099560	2114280	animes in the past i love all the oldies all the oldies i didn't watch the new trigon though
2114280	2117880	the new one that came out they did a remake or something or something like that i don't know if
2117880	2127640	it's a remake i just know they did read it and it's sort of sort of like cgi cgi ish i think cgi ish
2127640	2134040	i haven't watched it yet i heard i saw some clips and stuff and it was really amazing so it's on
2134040	2140440	my list to watch but i'm really nervous to watch og stuff because you know when you watch like really
2140440	2147400	old stuff it starts and you watch the remix of it it loses the charm it loses the charm that it
2147400	2154120	once had and it kind of makes me sad so i'm a little afraid a little afraid to
2154280	2159480	so you don't have into that into that
2174600	2183240	i also love the art style of kiju number kiju number haven't uh really watched it yet though
2184280	2193400	but i've seen also like i really like gathering seasonal anime like my habit is i gather
2194200	2200920	and then i can pick which ones i've been dying to watch and which ones i really want to watch
2200920	2207560	based off the trailer and i watch those first i binge like i stay up to date with those and then
2207560	2213480	i let the others sit in the back and like all i wait for all the episodes and stuff to come out
2213560	2216680	and then i binge those that's how i watch my anime
2219960	2223640	so there's some things i haven't watched yet and there's some things i'm sitting on and there's
2223640	2229080	some things i've been spoiled or like i stopped watching stuff i've been spoiled on and i wait
2229080	2234920	like a few weeks for my brain to forget and then i'll go back and watch it so yeah
2237640	2241720	it's okay you're not late there's no lateness here
2243560	2252120	i love binge watching but sometimes hard to wait it is very hard to wait it's very hard
2255480	2261160	i have i spoke about the spice and wolf one too i've seen the original i know the whole song of the
2261160	2268520	original the ending song i have not seen the new one yet
2291160	2302520	the world
2321720	2332520	and
2340760	2345080	yeah i like spice and wolf a lot oh it's quite a lot of anime
2346040	2352200	i'm surprised like it got to the point where i can no longer remember the anime i've watched
2352760	2358600	that's how bad it is i've watched too much anime even i can say that i've watched too much anime
2358600	2365160	way too much way too much that if someone were to ask me to give them a recommendation like on the spot
2365160	2371480	i wouldn't be able to think of any one anime that i'll only be able to say right away is a really good
2371560	2378840	starter anime is hunter x hunter that's it and then and then after that i'd probably name some new anime
2381880	2389080	i'm really bad at recommending anime because i can never remember any any uh
2389880	2397080	like i my brain likes to be like well what if they don't like old anime if you send them straight
2397080	2403880	away to old anime they might not watch it because of the art style and i know how new people are to anime
2403880	2410760	they will not watch something if the art looks stupid if it doesn't look like hd look clean or blah blah
2410760	2416680	no one will watch it no one will watch it yeah i used to recommend death no but like i said people don't
2416680	2424360	like the art style new people these new generations they don't like it they don't like the art style
2424360	2427720	they will not watch it so i stopped recommending it
2433640	2441160	but hunter x hunter is like really clean with their animation um uh the remake of hunter x hunter
2441160	2449000	the remake the remake uh and formal alchemist brotherhood yelp is also a good recommendation
2449640	2458520	but uh i just feel sad recommending full metal alchemist brotherhood only because the original is so good
2459640	2466280	it's so good because they don't like they give you the emotion emotional attachment to the characters
2466840	2473000	by doing the side stories by doing the other stuff brotherhood just takes that away to make it shorter
2473000	2479240	so that you only watch the main plot and the original the original ending
2480760	2490600	of full metal alchemist isn't canon sadly it isn't canon but apparently brotherhood's ending is canon
2492040	2499960	so that's that's what makes it sad so it's a little sloppy it's a little messy i like the original i like
2499960	2504600	feeling attachment to the characters i like feeling how they feel and so it's at work
2504680	2530040	i hope you guys don't mind us just chilling out for a second
2530440	2535080	before we play one shot
2540600	2544280	never watch hunter x hunter you're missing out better get the watch in
2545800	2552680	missing out get the watch in right after stream though what right after stream not right now
2553400	2565000	yep spyax family is also a good recommendation but like i said spyax family is still a new anime
2565000	2570200	technically still a new anime just because of the season 2 does not make it an old anime it is brand new
2571560	2579000	it is brand new uh so it's you can only recommend anime that are like two years old to people now
2579720	2583480	because no one's gonna watch the old stuff if it's if the animation's not good
2585800	2588840	if the animation's not good they're not gonna watch it you know they're gonna be like
2588840	2597400	ah that's just trash that's trash artwork trash ah that's terrible terrible and then they'll
2597400	2603240	talk about how dbz is the main one that's amazing well nothing's on there's nothing on dbz
2604040	2608920	there's nothing on there don't get me wrong i like dbz i watch all of it even super even
2608920	2621640	super i watch it but that's literally what people say there's nothing on dbz like okay all right
2623320	2630040	okay i try i even it's it's starting to get sad that i recommend Naruto to people and people are like
2630120	2638680	like irl gross all because of the old artwork in the original when they were in the when they
2638680	2643240	were younger because that's why i tell them to watch first when they're younger and animation
2643240	2653160	when they were younger is it is a memory it's nostalgia all right
2653640	2663000	so tokyo gu is also a good starter that's true i also recommend that
2664040	2670520	that's a good starter if you haven't watched any anime tokyo gu tokyo gu uh however
2671640	2676680	i will say i always forget this i am only gonna say i like tokyo gu season one
2676680	2687960	i hate the fact that the next season like forces you to read the manga in order for you to be up to date
2688680	2694600	and i think that's dumb i think this is the dumbest thing any any any anime any show you have a tv show i don't
2694600	2700360	care what show it is i don't care i don't care i don't care i don't care i don't i don't i don't care
2700920	2711880	i think it's the dumbest thing that any show could ever do why why why just add it add it in the end
2711880	2716120	season two that's the whole point of you making it into an anime so i could watch it with my eyeballs
2716120	2723800	with my eyeballs watch the animation with my eyeballs i want to see moving pictures i want
2723800	2730200	to see flashing lights i want to see all of it i i don't i don't i don't i don't like the fact that they
2730200	2739240	they force you to go read the manga and then you can watch season two season one banger banger
2753960	2765160	why did you choose brad to cover i like brad you know man it's only hair because i like brad
2766200	2767800	brad don't you like brad
2767800	2769800	what
2775880	2784200	they're reanimating original nardo no no no no no no
2786440	2789880	where did you hear this from no i don't like this no
2790040	2799160	oh it's only been 15 years come on that's not that long
2802920	2810520	it's only been 15 years come on it was in the five another five another five years

3129240	3131240	male lead
3131240	3133240	male lead will never give up on trying to save people
3133240	3135240	let herself get kidnapped

3137240	3139240	get kidnapped
3139240	3141240	no she walked into the arms of the enemy
3141240	3143240	and then was like
3143240	3145240	why are you fighting to save me

3157240	3159240	in distress
3159240	3161240	she didn't have to go
3161240	3163240	she didn't have to do that
3163240	3165240	she didn't have to do that
3165240	3167240	it wasn't necessary
3167240	3169240	it wasn't necessary
3175240	3177240	hueco mundo was literally

3181240	3183240	ouch i hit my arm
3189240	3191240	it was preventable
3191240	3193240	it was
3199240	3201240	but they needed something
3201240	3203240	they needed something to get them to do things
3203240	3205240	i guess i guess
3205240	3207240	so she was the anchor
3207240	3209240	she was the forced anchor
3209240	3211240	i guess
3211240	3213240	i don't like orihime
3213240	3215240	she made me angry

3333140	3339140	To be there. She didn't need to go anywhere. She put herself in a situation she didn't need to be in.
3339140	3347140	I guess the only reason why they needed her to go was to give emotion to the antagonist.
3347140	3357140	The antagonist needed to gain something, a feeling or something. And the only person that can give that to him was Orohime.
3357140	3363140	I'm trying not to say too much without much spoiling.
3375140	3379140	He needed a reason. He needed something, some feelings.
3379140	3383140	Orohime was I guess the only person that can really give that to him.
3384140	3386140	That's what I have.
3386140	3389140	I hate when stories kind of like force.
3389140	3392140	Like it feels so forced.
3394140	3400140	Like who thinks that? Who goes I'm just gonna go to the enemy. I have no other choice.
3402140	3409140	And then act surprised when the characters spent like how many seasons saving people
3409140	3413140	And acting as if the person would never save you.
3413140	3415140	And then you wish him a goodbye.
3415140	3424140	Goodbye. Don't worry about me. Don't come for me. I'm sorry. Goodbye.
3429140	3433140	I also like Grimjall a lot. I guess he'd be my third favorite.
3433140	3436140	Grimjall Jaggerjack. I like Grimjall.
3437140	3440140	Yeah, he'd be my third.
3455140	3458140	How disrespectful he was during a fight. True.
3461140	3465140	I really just like them delinquents. I don't know.
3466140	3472140	He's so cute. His little bells and his little tenet.
3472140	3476140	He won't kill a puppy. He didn't want to kill baby.
3488140	3491140	It's a new anime of Bleach. I heard it at Remake.
3491140	3495140	It's not really a remake. It's more like a new season. Like a continuation.
3496140	3500140	So yeah, it's out now. Actually, I haven't seen it yet though.
3501140	3503140	I haven't seen it yet.
3505140	3509140	I don't like cliffhangers when it comes to that show. So I'm waiting.
3511140	3515140	It's like a new season. How many years? Excuse me.
3515140	3517140	Excuse me.
3520140	3523140	Oh, my throat. Oh my gosh.
3525140	3530140	How many years? It's been a long time.
3533140	3536140	You thought Bleach ended officially? No, it did not.
3536140	3540140	Bleach, when Bleach ended, the manga was still ongoing.
3540140	3544140	The manga never stopped. The manga kept going.
3544140	3546140	So it did not end.
3549140	3559140	Sadly, it's because a lot of people in the fanbase pressured the author to make more.
3559140	3564140	I think he made an interview where he said he didn't want to make more.
3565140	3568140	But he was pressured to make more.
3571140	3573140	So the manga kept going.
3574140	3575140	parameters
3584140	3586140	Yeah.
3590140	3591140	I think so.

3859780	3875220	through season two of rise and to hero so whenever i started whenever i started an episode
3876580	3884340	i would take season one's opening song play it skip the season two opening song
3890340	3892340	so
3900580	3912340	that's how that's how i got through it
3912820	3914900	so
3917620	3922500	you just couldn't do that for season three it just didn't work that way it was so boring
3926740	3928100	gaslighting yourself
3931140	3936100	so the the opening for season one was so good come on
3936420	3941060	it was so good
3945700	3952180	one piece favorite character is zoro um i'm um zoro
3955060	3965620	i think i think that's i think that i don't think i don't think uh i guess zoro and robin robin robin robin
3967060	3972420	yeah zoro zoro my favorite one piece character ace was
3977220	3978260	white beard was
3985620	3992020	and now we have now i'm left with zoro and luffy those are my two favorite characters the main character
3992020	3993940	and zoro
4022980	4029220	um almost unprecedented levels of culture from i just watched too much anime
4030740	4034740	i don't leave home so i just watched too much anime
4038500	4042260	i've watched quite a lot of anime so much actually
4043700	4048180	yeah oh my gosh we've been chilling here for an hour
4048260	4052340	we're gonna be streaming for quite some time
4061860	4064260	it's already been an hour holy shit
4068180	4068660	i mean
4074340	4077540	we haven't even started playing the game i was so worried about the lag
4078500	4089540	i was so worried about the lag it was so weird
4090100	4100900	um
4104340	4110020	do i have a favorite anime or genre you can't ask me that question
4110820	4118420	i don't i don't have a i don't have a favorite anime i i have a current favorite anime
4119220	4123460	i don't have an all-time favorite anime i have a bunch of all-time favorite anime
4125460	4128260	but i can't put them on a wait on a wait and weigh them
4128980	4134100	like which is better i can't do that i've watched too many i can't do that
4136260	4143140	least favorite anime my brain probably forgot them so i can't think of them right now
4143940	4147860	you know how when something was like really bad experience when you were watching it
4147860	4153380	so your brain blocked it out so your brain just blocks it out
4158580	4159700	not can't think of one
4163620	4170500	but i'm on my current favorite right now that is even topping slime at the moment
4171060	4174900	slime and tsukimichi because tsukimichi is also just talking at the moment
4175860	4178420	uh they they're doing the same thing as slime
4179540	4184100	he really doesn't want to fight he's like avoiding fighting by doing other things
4185300	4190260	and there's too many cliffhangers he was falling for this from the sky for two episodes
4190820	4194180	i i two episodes he was falling from the sky i don't know
4196420	4201060	and it was just going to everyone else i don't care about everyone else i want to see him fight
4201060	4209780	uh what if i want to see him murder die die die kill kill kill you know yeah yeah
4212260	4219780	so um right now my the anime i'm watching at at the moment that has like really god-tier animation
4220500	4226900	i think the animation is crazy my eyes are blessed uh seventh prince reincarnate into the seventh prince
4227700	4229780	um something about focus on non-magic
4231380	4235220	something about focusing on magic i could pull it up hang on
4237940	4245060	it's like right here bam right in my face as the seventh prince so i can take my time
4245620	4252020	perfecting my magical ability you know god-tier animation mcs hellcube
4252180	4252980	uh
4255700	4261300	muskwish so adorable i like characters who are absolutely insane
4263140	4267540	i love that i love revenge i like people who don't care about other people
4269380	4272100	and people who are absolutely op for no reason
4274820	4280100	and i like seeing people scared in shock when they belittle someone because of their appearance
4280820	4287620	i like it i like it a lot like take that you thought he was just a child he thought he was just weak
4289140	4291060	he's gonna absolutely destroy you
4299300	4304980	it's good i like it a lot i i say it's a muskwatch for me
4305700	4311860	i'm also watching remonster it's good for like a like a
4313060	4320340	you uh board kind of thing and you like just want to chill and watch something that tells a story in a little
4321860	4328580	in a in a different way so remonster is pretty good the opening was made fun of a lot
4329460	4331620	but it kind of grows on you as you keep watching
4331780	4341060	and the opening was really weird the animation of the opening is weird the opening song itself
4341060	4348260	is pretty amazing it's good the song is good but whoever made the animation for the opening
4350180	4355700	whoever made the animation is questionable it's questionable
4355700	4364500	the song is good the anime is good the opening of the animations
4366260	4372340	strange yeah remonster remonster yeah yeah yeah
4379220	4380500	it's about goblins
4386340	4394420	someone got reincarnated as a a monster i think and that's the the rest is you find out by watching it
4395460	4399220	i can't really say much or everything i'll say about the show is basically a spoiler
4400740	4403620	go watch it i am
4409060	4415540	it was always a harem anime though it was always a harem anime i guess what made people
4415540	4421380	kind of like it more is that the main the emcee doesn't doesn't freak out
4422820	4430820	like like all the original emcees when they're around a bunch of girls they freak out or they play dumb
4431620	4438820	or they're scared or they're terrified uh yada yada yada this emcee is not like that at all
4439780	4447380	he accepts everything with open arms and he's very uh logical and stuff about it
4448420	4450900	but he's like a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
4453140	4461380	and i think that's i guess his own appeal to it so it's always been a harem even in the manga so yeah
4464980	4466820	so if you weren't ready for it yeah
4469780	4477300	yeah i'm not a big fan of harem either but i like the plot of the story itself of where everything leads
4478260	4485300	uh it keeps you interested um the i guess you'd call it random fanservice
4486900	4489940	then it's a big old fanservice
4492660	4495460	yeah the harem part of the manga was a little too much
4498820	4505380	i'm not a huge fan of uh harem harem anime but there are just some that are good
4511940	4513220	only some that are good
4518260	4526740	and maybe i should start on one shot you guys ready to uh watch one shot
4527460	4534580	i see some people are still getting the crash or uh the stream end somehow unfortunately

4608500	4615300	but the newer voice actors lately aren't doing it for me they don't get into their role
4615300	4618900	it sounds like they don't care and i hate that i think that sucks

4912820	4913540	hi person
4916500	4919460	there was a time where our people used to live in these runs
4921300	4925540	but due to the flooding most of us have moved to the less permanent settlement
4926500	4930820	flooding a the land has gotten brittle
4931860	4933940	and glenn used to be in one piece you know
4935300	4941300	but now it's just a bunch of islands that get smaller and smaller uh
4943300	4946500	is that it do you still live here sorry though
4947300	4955220	fish populations near the village are thinning so we fisher folk are making temporary shelter here
4955860	4960340	makes sense the deeper ruins have been abandoned for a while though
4962180	4967380	well i do see some kids coming in and out of those i think they actually live there

8977160	8979160	We can take your snake.
8981160	8984160	And she gave the snake to them.
8984160	8986160	And they've had the snake for years.
8988160	8990160	And she gave them the snake.
8992160	8995160	And do you know what they do with the snake?
8995160	8997160	They ate it.
8997160	8999160	They ate the snake.

9022160	9024160	She was so sad.

9158160	9160160	Oh, anomaly.
9164160	9166160	Can someone teach me English?
9166160	9168160	Because I don't know English.
9168160	9171160	Can someone please teach me English?
9176160	9179160	Why are words so hard?
9179160	9183160	Words should not be this hard.
9196160	9199160	I am not a teacher. I can't teach you.
9199160	9202160	Become one so that you can't teach me.
9206160	9209160	Well, yeah, but...
9211160	9214160	I used to go to speech therapy.
9214160	9218160	Because I had a hard time saying certain words.
9218160	9222160	And I have an issue with drawing out my sentences.
9225160	9228160	Even like I'm doing right now.
9228160	9231160	And I have a stuttering problem.
9231160	9233160	So I used to go to speech therapy.
9233160	9235160	I didn't help.
9240160	9244160	I saw someone mention themselves about it somewhere.
9244160	9246160	I think it was in the comments somewhere.
9246160	9248160	And I relate to that.
9248160	9251160	Because they didn't help me at all either.
9253160	9257160	I was in speech therapy for years.

9410160	9412160	i'm gonna get this
9420160	9422160	i suffer from really dry skin as well
9422160	9424160	so
9426160	9428160	i understand
9428160	9430160	but mine is a little different
9430160	9432160	as i have blotches
9432160	9434160	a special lotion
9436160	9438160	i have a special lotion that i use
9442160	9444160	i dropped a cereal on the floor
9444160	9446160	i'm gonna end up stepping on that later
9446160	9448160	i found that
9452160	9454160	i have a special lotion
9454160	9456160	that i use for my
9456160	9458160	for those spots
9458160	9460160	they help a lot
9462160	9464160	but
9466160	9468160	if i don't use the lotion
9468160	9470160	much
9470160	9472160	i end up really drying up
9474160	9476160	this is why i'm only allowed to take a shower
9476160	9478160	once every other day
9478160	9480160	or once every two days
9480160	9482160	because too much water can make me
9482160	9484160	start peeling like a lizard
9488160	9490160	i become a full on lizard
9490160	9492160	i become a full on lizard

9976880	9980880	Is it you? Are you allergic to shower?
9982480	9986720	No, it's not me. I'm not allergic to shower.
9987680	9993440	It's like an old friend all the way in the past when I was a kid.
9993440	10000960	I haven't seen them in a long time. It's been many many many years.
10000960	10004400	I also knew someone who was allergic to the sun.
10004400	10006960	I knew someone who was allergic to the sun rays.
10006960	10011760	They would break out into heavy heavy rash.

10079040	10083040	Niko so cute.
10086040	10090040	Azura had another dream. Did you see this one too?
10090040	10092040	Yeah.
10092040	10096040	I was in a big field like the one in my last dream.
10096040	10099040	And I saw my village.
10099040	10102040	But I only woke up.
10102040	10109040	Ah, I don't think this world has anything like that.
10109040	10114040	I mean, big wheat fields.
10114040	10121040	The only big plants I've seen here are a bunch of weird trees.
10121040	10124040	And these balls of moss floating in the water.
10124040	10128040	Wait, is moss even a plant?
10128040	10131040	Say, have you seen a wheat field before?
10131040	10134040	Yes, I have.
10134040	10141040	A long, long time ago, I used to live in one.
10141040	10145040	It was massive. It was pretty.
10145040	10149040	There's a lot of dragonflies everywhere.
10149040	10150040	Yes.
10150040	10153040	Oh, really pretty, aren't they?
10153040	10158040	It is very pretty, especially when the sun's up.
10158040	10164040	The one around my village goes around for miles.
10164040	10167040	I have a really bad throat, so I don't know.
10167040	10170040	Hydrating isn't always gonna help.
10170040	10174040	So it's okay, don't worry about it.
10174040	10179040	I will keep hydrating though, so don't you worry.
10179040	10194040	I have more water right here.
10194040	10198040	Plants are really tall, sometimes I can't even see through them.
10198040	10202040	When it's windy out, the wind can make waves in it.
10202040	10205040	It's like an ocean of food.
10205040	10208040	Oh wait, there's food in regular oceans too.
10208040	10210040	Like fish or crabs.
10210040	10215040	I've never actually been to a real ocean until now, actually.
10215040	10217040	I've been to the ocean.
10217040	10219040	Really?
10219040	10222040	That's really cool, Azura.
10222040	10226040	I've only seen the ocean on TV before.
10226040	10231040	I've never thought I'd get to ride on a boat through water.
10231040	10233040	I can't read.
10233040	10236040	I never thought I'd get to ride a boat through one.
10236040	10243040	The water back home doesn't have glowy stuff like how it is here either.
10243040	10247040	But I guess it's because the world is already so dark.
10253040	10256040	Are you getting sleepy?
10256040	10258040	It's okay to fall asleep.
10258040	10264040	I don't mind you all resting your eyes if you find yourself falling asleep to the stream.
10264040	10266040	It's okay.
10277040	10279040	Are you just waking up in the morning?
10280040	10283040	It's alright. Time to let the differences be.
10285040	10287040	It's very fun.
10296040	10299040	You know, I used to be scared of the dark, Azura.
10299040	10302040	Me too! I used to be terrified of the dark!
10302040	10308040	I'll tell you, I had some family members who were like big old jerks.
10308040	10310040	Bullies, really.
10310040	10313040	They used to lock me in a closet when I was younger.
10313040	10319040	They'd lock me in a closet and let me out for like 30 minutes to an hour.
10319040	10323040	And I grew a big fear of the dark ever since then.
10323040	10328040	They always made fun of me for being scared of the dark as I got older.
10328040	10332040	But I mean, it's your fault.
10332040	10334040	It's literally your fault.
10334040	10337040	I was scared of the dark for a long, long time.
10337040	10340040	I'm only literally now getting used to it.
10340040	10342040	And I'm so old.
10344040	10346040	I'm so old.
10346040	10348040	I used to sleep with a TV on.
10348040	10354040	It's the only way I can sleep, either with a fan or some little night lights.
10354040	10356040	I have like a couple of night lights in my room.
10356040	10362040	I have a light that turns like rainbow-y colors, like all the colors of the rainbow.
10362040	10367040	And I have a couple of lights on the other side of my room, too.
10371040	10377040	So yeah, it's really hard for me to sleep at night, even until this day.
10385040	10387040	I'm worried so you don't worry about it.
10387040	10389040	I'm worried.
10389040	10391040	I'm fine.
10391040	10395040	There literally is no need.
10395040	10399040	I don't want anyone to feel worried about me, okay?
10399040	10401040	Okay?
10401040	10403040	I'm okay.
10406040	10410040	It's a little hard to imagine that now.
10410040	10413040	After spending so much time here.
10414040	10419040	But not long ago, I couldn't even go to sleep without a lamp.
10419040	10421040	I still can't.
10423040	10425040	Me, too.
10431040	10433040	Really?
10433040	10437040	Even though you're a god, gods have fears, too.
10437040	10439040	Goddesses have fears, too.
10443040	10446040	Yeah, I see it.
10446040	10450040	Oh, but it's a good thing I got over that fear.
10450040	10454040	Otherwise, I wouldn't last long here.
10454040	10458040	And again, I've been carrying around the sun.
10458040	10460040	That's not too bad.
10460040	10463040	Thanks, Nico more brave than me.
10465040	10469040	Also, I don't feel scared at all with you guiding me.
10469040	10472040	So, thanks for that.
10472040	10474040	He's so cute.
10474040	10476040	Oh my god.
10476040	10479040	Oh my god, did you see a little cat smiley there?
10479040	10481040	So cute.
10494040	10498040	Anyway, maybe we should head out now, Zara.
10498040	10504040	How big fear gods have, gods and goddesses definitely have?
10506040	10510040	The fear of loneliness, the fear of being alone.
10512040	10516040	You live basically forever.
10517040	10525040	And then, all of a sudden, everyone around you is gone.
10529040	10533040	It's lonely. It's very lonely.
10549040	10552040	And that's why I have you guys.
10552040	10555040	We will quail each other's loneliness.
10558040	10562040	Yeah, yeah.
10588040	10591040	All right.
10612040	10614040	It's like a fear.
10614040	10616040	Everyone's big fear.
10616040	10629040	And that's why it's easier for a god or a goddess to understand how that one emotion feels to a full extent.
10638040	10640040	You're not alone. I can relate.
10640040	10644040	Being the only one left after struggling for so long
10645040	10653040	Is I'm just a lonely soul. Relatable. I understand how you feel.
10653040	10660040	Watch your lore. I away hold forever. Never let go. Never let go.
10660040	10664040	How sweet. I appreciate that.
10665040	10675040	I found a pen. Sort of. Good. Please write your name here.
10681040	10682040	Good luck.
10683040	10693040	I like the little jingle. It's cute. It's very cute. Cute jingle.
10693040	10698040	Is there anything else I'm supposed to do here? I feel like I'm forgetting something.
10712040	10714040	What in the world?
10736040	10738040	It's squares.
10742040	10757040	It's medication time. I have to take my medication real fast.
10757040	10759040	We're in a new location.
10759040	10772040	I want to finish the game.
10772040	10782040	In another hour, I'll take them.
10782040	10786040	I'll take them. I'll take the medication.
10786040	10788040	In another hour.
10790040	10795040	If I take them now, it'll put me to sleep. I don't want to go to sleep.
10795040	10799040	I'm fixating now.
10799040	10801040	In another hour, I'll take them.
10807040	10810040	Want us to remind you? Sure. You can do that.
10810040	10812040	I'd appreciate that.
10816040	10820040	The sun. Hello, Messiah. Welcome to the refuge.
10820040	10824040	Do you understand what you must do here?
10824040	10827040	I'm supposed to go inside the tower, right?
10827040	10834040	I already see the tower, so I guess we must be close to the entrance on the surface.
10834040	10837040	The surface? Look down, small one.
10837040	10839040	Oh, we're pretty high up.
10839040	10843040	I guess I gotta get down a lot of stairs.
10843040	10845040	I'll find an elevator. Correct.
10845040	10848040	However, the tower is a sacred place.
10848040	10853040	Finding the entrance may be easy, but that alone will not be enough.
10853040	10855040	What do you mean?
10855040	10862040	Once you reach the surface, I recommend visiting the library for leads.
10862040	10864040	Alright, thank you.
10864040	10866040	Off you go then.
10866040	10869040	I'm afraid this area is off limits for you.
10869040	10878040	Only the bearer of the sacred kernel is permitted to access the garden.
10881040	10884040	Sacred kernel? Have a kernel.
10890040	10894040	Oh, like kernel corn? Have this.
10894040	10898040	It was left behind by the plant lady in the glen.
10899040	10901040	This is indeed the kernel.
10901040	10904040	Then it is your duty to regrow her.
10904040	10906040	Do you understand what you must do?
10906040	10909040	Um, yep, good.
10909040	10913040	We may now pass through to access the garden.
10913040	10915040	Weee!
10930040	10935040	I'm about to see it in the planter.
10935040	10941040	There's no dirt in this pot. Will the seed really grow like this?
10945040	10947040	Do I need dirt?
10952040	10954040	I gotta get dirt.
10960040	10963040	It's the shape of the light bulb.
10966040	10968040	We gotta get dirt.
10968040	10997040	I agree. I also, I am, being alone has its ups and downs, whether it is the quiet.
10997040	10999040	I really like my solitude.
10999040	11001040	I really do.
11009040	11013040	That didn't scare me. I wasn't scared once.
11013040	11015040	That didn't scare me at all.
11015040	11018040	Come on!
11018040	11021040	Come on!
11021040	11023040	Work already!
11023040	11025040	What was that?
11025040	11027040	I really do like my solitude.
11027040	11030040	I like spending time to myself sometimes.
11030040	11040040	But you really do hate when it's like really, really, really quiet.
11040040	11045040	You miss the noise that surrounds it and stuff.
11047040	11050040	I don't hate it when I'm like with someone.
11051040	11063040	It's more like when being talked to when you're like enjoying your solitude.
11063040	11068040	You know, like when you're like watching anime and someone starts talking to you.
11068040	11071040	Doesn't that not bother you?
11071040	11074040	Come on! Come on!
11074040	11076040	I'm too busy for this.
11076040	11078040	Excuse me?
11078040	11082040	Whoa, you are you?
11082040	11087040	Oh jeez, I didn't think I was gonna run into.
11087040	11089040	This is embarrassing.
11089040	11093040	Er, is there anything I can help you with?
11093040	11095040	Yes please.
11095040	11098040	I would like to know how to get to the surface.
11098040	11102040	Yeah, I was afraid you were gonna say that.
11102040	11106040	Right now, this elevator is the only way to access the surface.
11106040	11111040	But yeah, just take a look at it.
11111040	11114040	It looks like an elevator.
11114040	11122040	Oh, you're not wrong, but go look at the button panel.
11122040	11123040	Huh?
11123040	11125040	There aren't any buttons.
11125040	11129040	Yup, that's a problem.
11129040	11136040	There's really a big button here that says ground on it.
11136040	11139040	You know, cause it takes you to the ground area.
11139040	11142040	Now it's been ripped out or something.
11142040	11146040	I tried looking everywhere for it to no avail.
11146040	11149040	Maybe it exploded?
11149040	11152040	Do you think we'll have to make a new one?
11152040	11153040	What?
11153040	11154040	How?
11154040	11157040	We'll figure it out.
11157040	11160040	Do you think we'll be able to make that button?
11160040	11162040	Well, no pressure kid.
11162040	11165040	I'll just stick with my original plan for now.
11165040	11170040	Time to kick the door again.
11170040	11175040	My foot hurts.
11175040	11177040	Silly Billy.
11177040	11178040	Okay.
11178040	11180040	They always say go left.
11180040	11182040	Oh.
11182040	11187040	Well, that's nothing there.
11187040	11190040	What's the bed?
11190040	11197040	We don't need that yet.
11197040	11199040	Oh, there's squares.
11199040	11210040	There's squares again.
11210040	11213040	You think you can clear the last two areas tonight?
11213040	11214040	Yeah.
11214040	11216040	We're gonna play for a while tonight.
11216040	11218040	I'm feeling up to it.
11218040	11224040	You know?
11224040	11226040	It is a Friday.
11226040	11229040	So I wanna enjoy a Friday night.
11229040	11244040	Being a noiseless house disturbs me.
11244040	11246040	But I can't stand loud noises.
11246040	11247040	Me too.
11247040	11251040	Actually, I agree.
11251040	11252040	Have fun learning.
11252040	11254040	Last time for me to go to sleep.
11254040	11256040	I'll have a good night.
11256040	11258040	Sweet dreams.
11258040	11260040	Good night.
11260040	11272040	Night night.
11272040	11275040	Wow.
11275040	11277040	This tells me go that way.
11277040	11280040	This says go down.
11280040	11287040	Sweet squares.
11287040	11290520	laboratories  Meghan
11317040	11320040	because the ground access elevator is broken
11320360	11321760	so I've been told
11322280	11326640	the city's infrastructure has been suffering a lot lately
11327280	11330560	skywalks and stairs breaking off left and right
11331040	11335040	now the only reliable way of transport of those elevators
11335160	11337120	until now anyway
11338720	11340040	milk and sugar
11340040	11341040	I like both
11341040	11342040	me too
11342040	11343640	but not in coffee
11344640	11347640	I like it in coffee
11349640	11350640	a lot of it
11350640	11352640	add a lot of it in coffee
11353640	11354640	coffee machine
11354640	11355640	nearly full
11359640	11362640	you know that's all guy came in here earlier
11362640	11363640	same the same thing
11364640	11366640	he asked me if I've seen a button that says ground on it
11367640	11369640	looked pretty stressed
11369640	11371640	so I wanted to cheer him up
11371640	11373640	until I'm not only ground
11373640	11376640	I've seen today's coffee grounds
11392640	11394640	I thought she was angry
11394640	11396640	I would be too
11398640	11399640	he didn't get it
11402640	11403640	shh
11406640	11408640	I see him around a lot
11408640	11411640	but never seems to have time to get a proper meal
11412640	11414640	he kind of just rushes in here
11414640	11416640	drinks a whole pot of coffee
11416640	11418640	and then rushes by out
11418640	11419640	yeah
11419640	11420640	he really like
11420640	11423640	he really takes his job to the extreme
11424640	11426640	I mean it's an important job
11426640	11428640	but nothing is worth
11428640	11430640	that amount of stress I think
11430640	11432640	what does he do?
11432640	11434640	maintenance I believe
11434640	11436640	something to do with the lights
11436640	11438640	but I don't know the details
11438640	11440640	maybe he can ask me later
11440640	11441640	oh
11441640	11442640	you're still here
11442640	11443640	would you
11445640	11446640	like something?
11446640	11447640	anything?
11447640	11449640	I can cook something for you if you want
11449640	11451640	sorry thank you
11453640	11455640	I am right here
11461640	11464640	okay so I can't go anywhere in there
11469640	11471640	was there like an area I missed or something?
11471640	11472640	over here
11482640	11484640	I'm like probably
11487640	11488640	good evening
11489640	11490640	well
11490640	11492640	the time of day doesn't really mean anything now
11493640	11495640	when the sun's gone
11495640	11497640	with the sun gone
11497640	11499640	the night never seems to end
11500640	11502640	well then
11502640	11503640	how can you tell?
11503640	11504640	time

11534640	11537640	they're just bolted so people won't steal them
11537640	11539640	feel free to use them
11540640	11542640	a tape dispenser
11543640	11546640	it's bolted to the table
11546640	11549640	oh my god I can't say the word bolted
11550640	11552640	why is it so hard?
11556640	11558640	a stapler
11560640	11562640	some kind of computer terminal
11563640	11566640	I am the power room mechanic
11566640	11568640	do you have an issue to report?
11568640	11570640	yeah actually
11570640	11572640	surface axis elevator appears to be broken
11572640	11574640	there's a button missing then
11574640	11576640	can you take a look?
11576640	11579640	leaving this room is not in my programming
11579640	11581640	I don't know
11590640	11592640	nah I don't like the music change
11592640	11594640	all of this button
11594640	11596640	I don't like this
11597640	11599640	computer
11602640	11605640	you're gonna need this soon
11605640	11607640	take this phone
11607640	11609640	and expose it to the void
11609640	11612640	the answer will be revealed when you bring it back again
11613640	11616640	the computer printed out a strange transparent sheet
11622640	11624640	still clueless
11624640	11626640	pick yours
11638640	11641640	where have my sense of humor gone?
11641640	11644640	why is that so funny to me?
11655640	11658640	did I make a weird film?
11663640	11665640	why is this happening?
11665640	11667640	because I'm hearing the goddess right now
11676640	11679640	it shouldn't be so funny but it is
11680640	11682640	a heavy piece of metal
11682640	11684640	sat into the wall
11684640	11687640	I think it might be a door or some kind of a
11687640	11689640	small screen here though
11701640	11703640	hello
11710640	11712640	wow
11713640	11716640	I've actually never been to the big city before
11716640	11718640	all these lights
11719640	11721640	all these people
11722640	11726640	I guess most of this world's population live here
11740640	11743640	I'm sorry it's the way he turns a look at me
11752640	11755640	it's very different from my village
11755640	11757640	the village is very small
11757640	11759640	surrounded by huge fields
11759640	11761640	saw a bit of it
11761640	11764640	in one of my dreams from a while ago
11764640	11766640	the tallest building in the world
11767640	11770640	the tallest buildings in our village
11770640	11773640	are only two stories tall
11784640	11786640	what about you Zara?
11786640	11788640	what do you love?
11792640	11794640	a city

11796640	11798640	wow
11798640	11801640	kind of mad and living in a city
11803640	11805640	must be exciting

11892640	11894640	did I walk in a circle?
11895640	11897640	did I walk in a circle?
11906640	11909640	was this just a giant circle?
11910640	11913640	I'm so confused
11928640	11930640	was it a circle?
11932640	11934640	I don't understand
11934640	11936640	now let me go back up
11936640	11938640	let me go

12403640	12405640	I've got models cw2
12405640	12407640	2nd gen
12407640	12409640	unit 4e here
12409640	12411640	to keep me company now
12411640	12413640	she still talks a little weird sometimes
12413640	12415640	but that's okay
12415640	12417640	she's learning
12417640	12419640	if I work real hard
12419640	12421640	she might even be tamed someday
12423640	12425640	I keep hearing that word
12425640	12427640	what tamed
12429640	12431640	nobody's told me what it means
12431640	12433640	yeah
12433640	12435640	that's just a robot thing
12435640	12437640	oh I didn't even read it
12437640	12439640	I can't really
12439640	12441640	something
12443640	12445640	nope
12445640	12447640	nope
12447640	12449640	nope
12449640	12451640	nope
12451640	12453640	can't really explain it either
12453640	12455640	while of large books
12455640	12457640	one of them is a robot instruction manual
12457640	12459640	it's off
12461640	12463640	right right here
12463640	12465640	there
12465640	12467640	there
12467640	12469640	another one
12471640	12473640	picture of a ram
12473640	12475640	wearing a little pink bow
12475640	12477640	it's a landscape portrait of the glen
12481640	12483640	something has been chewing on this plant
12483640	12485640	it's the ram
12485640	12487640	ram
12487640	12489640	ram
12489640	12491640	ram

12497640	12499640	this city life
12499640	12501640	what to expect
12501640	12503640	I just moved here from the glen
12503640	12505640	it's so different in the city
12505640	12507640	you went to the glen right?
12507640	12509640	yeah
12509640	12511640	everything's so green back there
12511640	12513640	I really miss it
12513640	12515640	I already gave me some plants to cheer me up
12515640	12517640	but
12517640	12519640	I should probably get a muzzle
12519640	12521640	for bestie here
12521640	12523640	bestie
12527640	12529640	how much of this plant
12529640	12531640	nope
12531640	12533640	just repeat
12533640	12535640	usually they always have a second dialogue
12535640	12537640	but sometimes they don't
12537640	12539640	I like to check just in case
12539640	12541640	hehe

12551640	12553640	I'm not sure what this is
12553640	12555640	it's like a little car
12555640	12557640	you should write on it
12559640	12561640	what?
12561640	12563640	do it

12760680	12764680	We got these growing lambs.
12764680	12768680	But they are a poor substitute for the sun.
12774680	12776680	This tree has leaves.
12776680	12778680	Ah yes, true.
12778680	12782680	Bully is just hard to come by nowadays.
12782680	12788680	You hardly ever see trees like these in the wild anymore.
12788680	12796680	And the ones you do see are pretty much all raised artificially by people like me.
12796680	12800680	Mostly for nostalgia purposes.
12806680	12808680	It's sweet.
12810680	12812680	Why is it in a flower pot?
12812680	12815680	Well, doesn't it look nice?
12815680	12817680	I guess.
12819680	12823680	I like to stand in the middle of the wheat fields back in my village.
12823680	12825680	It goes on for miles.
12825680	12828680	Ah, I wish I could have seen it.
12828680	12834680	In our world, meat is usually only grown in small isolated pots.
12834680	12837680	Or in a flower pot.
12839680	12841680	There's a phosphor tree.
12841680	12845680	Oh, like the ones we saw in the Glen.
12846680	12848680	Where are the leaves?
12848680	12850680	They're not dead, are they?
12850680	12852680	Oh, not at all.
12852680	12859680	Although these trees are common, composed of woody tissue, they are closer to grass.
12859680	12862680	Anonymy-wise.
12862680	12865680	So the branches are actually leaves?
12865680	12867680	Sort of.
12867680	12873680	What is interesting about these plants is the amount of phosphorus they generate.
12873680	12875680	Zero before dinner?
12875680	12876680	Yeah.
12876680	12878680	I'm an adult!
12896680	12897680	Phosphor.
12897680	12899680	That's the glowy stuff, right?
12899680	12900680	Yup.
12900680	12905680	Phosphor can store light energy and slowly emit it over time.
12910680	12916680	Most of the phosphorus from this world still contains energy from before the sun went out.
12916680	12918680	Without the sun to recharge them though.
12918680	12921680	Well, let's talk about something else.
12931680	12932680	Hmm.

13061340	13065340	They could have saved it, saved those openings for later on.
13067340	13069340	They could have saved it.
13069340	13072340	They didn't have to make so many back to back to back.
13080340	13082340	Couldn't get into black over.
13084340	13087340	The power system was a bit weird to understand.
13087340	13092340	They eventually explained it to you in better detail further into the anime.
13092340	13101340	But it's meant to confuse you because even to the regular like even to the emcee it was confusing.
13101340	13107340	So it was like meant to kind of confuse you like what's going on.
13107340	13115340	Like this is dumb whatever this hierarchy stuff is dumb and it makes you agree with the emcee.
13116340	13119340	So yeah, it was silly.
13120340	13124340	But then they eventually explain it properly over time.
13125340	13131340	Probably don't only plant hard enough to survive naturally outside the glenn.
13133340	13140340	Personally, I think they're really born look at one of my customers really loves them though.
13141340	13145340	I think all of the black clovers I'm growing here are for him actually.
13145340	13147340	And I think of it.
13147340	13149340	Haven't seen him in a while.
13149340	13151340	Wonder when he's coming back.
13152340	13155340	Coming to pick the mom these up.
13158340	13160340	Hmm, it's a pink flower.
13162340	13164340	Smoke garden tool.
13164340	13168340	And the part shaped like an owl.
13168340	13170340	I get it.
13176340	13178340	I don't get it.
13186340	13188340	I don't get it.
13188340	13190340	I don't get it.
13190340	13192340	I don't get it.
13197340	13199340	A hoe?
13199340	13201340	Is it because it's like a hoe?
13201340	13203340	So it's like who who?
13203340	13205340	A hoe?
13205340	13207340	No, but it's not a hoe.
13209340	13211340	That's not what you call it.
13213340	13215340	Garden tool.
13216340	13218340	Trowel.
13239340	13241340	I knew that.
13241340	13243340	I knew that.
13244340	13246340	I knew that.
13248340	13249340	Hello there.
13249340	13251340	You have a lot of plants.
13251340	13252340	A dune.
13252340	13254340	All of these myself you see.
13257340	13259340	Feel free to ask.
13259340	13261340	Oh, you're a gardener right?
13261340	13265340	Do you have any dirt for growing plants I mean?
13265340	13267340	Yup, do you need some?
13267340	13268340	Yes.
13268340	13272340	I'm supposed to plant the seeds I find while I plant later.
13273340	13276340	The pod in the garden doesn't have any soil.
13276340	13277340	I see.
13277340	13279340	I know what you're talking about.
13279340	13282340	Here, take this whole bag.
13282340	13284340	Thanks Mr. Plant person.
13284340	13286340	I like your little bowl.
13286340	13289340	Little bowl around your neck.
13289340	13292340	Most of the plants in our world tend to grow in the plant.
13292340	13296340	Even if it's facing the flooding issue.
13296340	13301340	It's still in better condition than the other two areas.
13301340	13305340	The barrens is, well, the barrens.
13305340	13310340	And Refuge City has barely enough ground to stand on.
13310340	13312340	Let alone grow still.
13312340	13316340	On a larger scale like this, I mean.
13316340	13317340	Is that it?
13317340	13319340	Good luck with the seed now.
13319340	13321340	Thank you, bye bye.
13321340	13335340	Our stairs here.
13335340	13337340	Coffee cups.
13337340	13339340	I'm too young to drink coffee.
13339340	13341340	Eh?
13341340	13342340	The coffee machine.
13342340	13344340	It's very warm.
13344340	13346340	Are you really?
13346340	13347340	What's the library?
13347340	13348340	I love books.
13348340	13350340	It looks like fun books.
13354340	13356340	Dog ear?
13356340	13358340	Dog ear.
13358340	13361340	Yeah, I was just testing you.
13361340	13363340	Just testing you guys.
13363340	13365340	We're bleeding hearts.
13365340	13367340	I was just testing you.
13367340	13369340	Hey there.
13369340	13371340	Hello.
13371340	13373340	You the Messiah?
13373340	13376340	I like your scarf.
13376340	13378340	Thank you.
13378340	13380340	Mama made it for me.
13380340	13382340	Tell her I like her needlework.
13382340	13383340	I will.
13383340	13385340	When I see her again.
13385340	13386340	Well.
13392340	13394340	Okay.
13394340	13396340	It's a kitchen.
13396340	13398340	Oh, it's a fridge.
13400340	13402340	A sink.
13402340	13404340	A trash can.
13404340	13406340	There's just magnets on it.
13406340	13408340	Maybe they'll come in handy.
13408340	13411340	I hope nobody will mind us taking them.
13411340	13414340	I have magnets now.
13414340	13416340	What's over here?
13416340	13418340	The door.
13418340	13420340	Trash can.
13422340	13424340	Is that it?
13424340	13426340	Your books?
13426340	13428340	Who knows that?
13428340	13429340	I think it's in here.
13429340	13433340	Looks like I can un-latch this door.
13433340	13435340	Nice.
13435340	13437340	Nothing is locked right here.
13439340	13441340	There's dirt now.
13460340	13462340	How old is Nico?
13462340	13463340	About a kitten.
13463340	13465340	Nico's a kitten.
13465340	13467340	Nico's quite young.
13467340	13468340	And cute.
13468340	13470340	Hello again, Messiah.
13470340	13472340	Do you need help?
13472340	13473340	No.
13473340	13475340	Off you go then.
13475340	13476340	Off you go.
13476340	13478340	I'm going.
13478340	13481340	Nico's a baby.
13481340	13484340	Nico's a cute little baby.
13488340	13491340	I hope this helps you grow a little seed.
13492340	13496340	Seeds in the soil, but it looks a bit dry.
13499340	13501340	Good thinking, Sarah.
13501340	13504340	Oh, there should help this seed grow.
13505340	13506340	Hmm.
13506340	13509340	The dirt's nice and moist now, but...
13509340	13511340	What if it dries out?
13511340	13514340	There's only so much water in this little tube.
13514340	13516340	I'll hold onto the tube for now.
13516340	13518340	Just in case.
13519340	13522340	I'll be giving it dirt and water.
13522340	13524340	But will that be enough?
13524340	13526340	I can't wait.
13526340	13528340	I'm coming to you.
13546340	13548340	I'm losing so much time.
13548340	13550340	I probably have 42 minutes of work already.
13550340	13552340	I hate this.

13626340	13629340	Can I, like, take water from there?
13639340	13643340	Or is it not gonna ask me for it yet?
13653340	13656340	Am I missing something?
13658340	13662340	I think I'm missing some sort of information.
13663340	13667340	I don't know what I'm missing, though.
13668340	13671340	I think I'm missing something.
13681340	13685340	I had my fan blowing in my direction this whole time.
13686340	13689340	I really hope it wasn't loud.
13692340	13695340	Was it, like, super loud?
13696340	13701340	I, like, just noticed the fan blowing in this direction.
13704340	13706340	No?
13708340	13710340	No? No?
13711340	13713340	Does anyone hear it?
13713340	13716340	I turned it down just in case.
13726340	13731340	I get stuck in games like this a lot. Me, too.
13731340	13735340	Did you find the computer in the area?
13735340	13738340	Oh, yeah, that's right! I forgot all about that.
13738340	13741340	Yeah, I found that. They gave me a film.
13746340	13750340	I heard nothing. The fan I was talking about was you, obviously, silly.
13750340	13754340	Oh, yeah, I have to get this. This thing.
13755340	13758340	It's bolted to the table.
13764340	13767340	How do I get it off the table?
13785340	13788340	I think I'm missing something.

13822340	13825340	I'll figure it out.
13825340	13828340	We'll grab a hand first, and we'll see.

13843340	13846340	I'm so real clueless.
13846340	13849340	We'll see.
13849340	13852340	Thank you.
13852340	13854340	I mean, figures.
13854340	13857340	We have to do it like that.
13857340	13860340	Well, no, Jim, yes.
13860340	13864340	There is void beyond the four walls.
13864340	13868340	The binder world to yours.
13868340	13872340	The edges of your viewport.
13872340	13876340	Where everything is obscure.
13876340	13879340	I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.
13885340	13889340	Pass the film through the void, and back again.
13890340	13893340	I don't know.
13893340	13896340	I don't know.
13896340	13899340	I don't know.
13899340	13902340	I don't know.
13902340	13905340	The screen?
13905340	13908340	Oh, the screen?
13908340	13911340	I remember this part. It's so funny.
13911340	13914340	Oh, sorry.
13914340	13917340	Okay.
13918340	13921340	I...
13921340	13924340	I...
13924340	13927340	What am I doing with this?
13930340	13934340	Pass it through the void.
13934340	13937340	And then back again.
13940340	13946340	How do you pass this through the void?
13947340	13950340	Back again.
13950340	13953340	Through the void.
13953340	13956340	Back again.
13964340	13967340	What?
13967340	13971340	I don't get it.
13971340	13975340	It's windowed currently, yeah?
13985340	13989340	Oh!
13989340	13993340	Oh!
13993340	13996340	Oh!
14006340	14010340	I feel that I'm still an accident.
14011340	14014340	That's what they mean by the void.
14014340	14017340	That's so stupid.
14017340	14020340	That's so stupid.
14020340	14023340	I can't believe I forgot.
14023340	14027340	I don't remember any of this.
14027340	14031340	I played this game so long ago.
14031340	14034340	Memory lane.
14034340	14037340	That's so dull.
14037340	14041340	I'm not going to tell a single soul what I did.
14041340	14045340	When one day you play the game yourself,
14045340	14048340	when one day you play the game yourself,
14048340	14052340	it'll be stuck like me.
14052340	14055340	It'll be stuck like me.
14055340	14058340	It'll be stuck like me.
14058340	14061340	It'll be stuck like me.
14061340	14064340	It'll be stuck like me.
14064340	14067340	Like me.
14075340	14078340	It'll get stuck.
14078340	14081340	It'll get stuck.
14081340	14084340	It'll get stuck.
14089340	14092340	Let me see.
14092340	14095340	Where do you put the code?
14095340	14098340	Was it up here?
14098340	14101340	Was it up here?

14110340	14113340	Do you guys remember the code?
14113340	14117340	I need you guys to help me remember the code.

14188340	14191340	Do I need a stabler?
14204340	14207340	I'm so confused. What now?
14219340	14222340	What now?
14222340	14225340	Uh oh, I'm yelling.
14225340	14228340	Was there a place that needed a lock?
14228340	14231340	That had a lock on it?
14249340	14252340	Do you guys remember a place like that?
14252340	14255340	But a lock on it?
14258340	14261340	That needed a passcode or something?
14268340	14271340	Don't be afraid to ask if you are hungry.
14271340	14274340	I want to make you something.
14278340	14281340	I don't remember seeing anything that a lock on it.
14282340	14285340	I don't know.
14303340	14306340	This is the bed, right?
14306340	14309340	Yeah.
14309340	14312340	I don't need bed right now.
14312340	14315340	I'm in bed.
14339340	14342340	A game like this?
14342340	14345340	I hate how I'm going to use my head,
14345340	14348340	but it's so satisfying to be.
14348340	14351340	Yeah, I agree.
14351340	14354340	I also hate using my head.
14360340	14363340	Did I miss something in here?

14776460	14777460	Uh-huh.
14783460	14786460	How do you go ahead and rock it to red people's rooms, yeah?
14792460	14794460	I'm still monitoring you.
14794460	14796460	Alert level has been set to low.

14823460	14825460	And what do I do with the codes?
14841460	14843460	Like, what am I missing?
14850460	14852460	I just got back from dinner.
14852460	14854460	I hope what did you eat yet?
14870460	14872460	I took my meds, don't worry.
14875460	14878460	You guys reminded me.
14879460	14881460	Taco burger is what?
14883460	14884460	That sounds amazing.
14886460	14888460	I really need to find a way to get to the library.
14889460	14890460	On the surface.
14890460	14892460	Or the library on the surface.
14900460	14901460	Oh, what?
14901460	14903460	How do you get it to fit?
14931460	14933460	This man said something about magnets.
14933460	14937460	But I don't see a way of these fitting into the panel by themselves.
14939460	14942460	The only thing that I can think of is the tape.
14943460	14946460	But I walked up to the tape.
14946460	14948460	I clicked on the tape.
14949460	14951460	But nothing happened.
14952460	14953460	I'll take this one there.
14953460	14954460	I'll take this one there.
14954460	14956460	Yeah, see you.
14961460	14970460	And the only hint I have is this table.
14970460	14972460	I mean this tape.
14973460	14976460	Like, what do you do with this tape?
14976460	14978460	What do you do with this tape?
14982460	14984460	Feel free to use though.
14985460	14987460	Can I, like, take some?
14988460	14990460	Give me tape.
14991460	14993460	There's no way to use this tape.
14994460	14995460	I don't know.
14996460	14997460	I don't know.

15057460	15059460	Look at that.
15059460	15061460	Is it not the tape?
15063460	15065460	How do I get this item?
15071460	15073460	There's something to do with the codes.
15074460	15075460	Right?

16649500	16650380	it's getting better
16650380	16660300	they said my doctor did it endoscopy and they were like uh it's probably swollen because of
16661020	16667180	i had too much stomach acid in my stomach uh so they had me on a bunch of medication to reduce
16667180	16675420	the stomach acid to get rid of the ulcers i also had erosion like there was like big black
16675500	16681420	blotches in my stomach that was like eroding my stomach walls were eroding
16683740	16689180	they were like it's probably because of uh either medication you are taking or the stomach acid

16829100	16834780	well i mean so they found this mass in my nose they told me it wasn't the c word
16834860	16848940	i said it wasn't that um which is thank goodness but um i had this
16850140	16857660	thing in my nose for a long time for about seven years and my doctors kept telling me i was fine
16858220	16862140	it's nothing to worry about all you're fine oh it's probably just a headache
16862220	16867420	i was probably just stressed i was probably just this probably just that like there's nothing
16867420	16874300	wrong with you you're fine so for seven whole years seven the nine years they kept dismissing me
16874300	16889980	sending me home so uh yeah um i one day i was working i was working at a job and i got hit with
16892220	16898220	like this is after they were already trying to fire me because i had a doctor's appointment
16898220	16902780	every week i had to see a therapist every week because i had just got out of the hospital
16904300	16912380	i just i got out of the hospital so i had to see a doctor every week and um it was mandatory and uh
16912460	16923740	uh uh um in order to get my medication i had to see the therapist therapist wouldn't prescribe
16923740	16929740	me anything unless i talked to them directly so it was mandatory that i went to these doctors
16929740	16937020	appointments and it was mandatory that i went to see my therapist i'm on and my psychiatrist
16937020	16943580	however um my the place i was working at did not like this even though i told them
16944380	16951580	before they hired me i set it on my application that i cannot work on this day which is
16952380	16963020	what would be old monday monday monday mondays i'm i'm i'm i cannot uh do anything on mondays
16963020	16968540	and tuesdays because i added tuesday because i have other doctors appointments that
16969660	16976140	layer on top of monday doctor appointments so now it's monday and tuesdays where you most likely
16976140	16985020	won't see me which is why i don't stream on mondays and tuesdays last week or this week was a exception
16985020	16993020	so yeah
16995980	17005660	it took them my job did not like the fact that i worked those days uh that i had to
17005660	17013100	go to my doctor's appointments those days so they uh they let me go and then they asked me
17013100	17023580	if i wanted to continue um if i wanted to continue working the next few days with them
17023580	17034700	and i said yeah and lo and behold at two days before my last day i got sick like it wasn't
17034780	17038300	like a normal sick
17051500	17057180	it wasn't like a normal sick i got a headache was i um
17057340	17064940	was a really really really bad headache my throat my throat is really
17066620	17069500	all right my throat is fine i'm fine
17072060	17076140	i think i just need to take pain pain meds real fast uh the other ones
17078860	17081820	these i take only when i'm feeling a certain pain
17087820	17093020	i think these i'll be fine i'll be okay all right don't worry don't worry don't worry
17097980	17105260	wow i got like an excruciating headache while i was working um this job
17106140	17109020	and it wouldn't go away i had taken um
17117900	17129980	i had taken some like painkillers for the headache and the headache didn't go away
17129980	17136940	i was so confused and it just persisted and got worse and worse and worse i'm like this is
17136940	17145020	the same headache i had like six years ago like this is the headache this is the pain
17145100	17152460	that i felt in my face that would not go away um and then it like just suddenly went away like a little later
17154780	17157420	uh and i'm like whatever so
17160140	17165420	and like no this this is not it this is this something wrong this one very very wrong
17166060	17174060	and the pain just traveled like in between the crease of your eye you know the nose the bridge of your nose
17174620	17178460	and that's where the pain was the bridge of my nose in between my eyebrows
17181180	17183020	um yeah
17186620	17190460	and it just it was like vibrating throughout my whole head
17191100	17193020	like starting from the front of my face
17193740	17205180	it was like that it was like wouldn't stop suddenly every light in my vicinity every bright light
17206140	17212380	i couldn't open my eyes if i opened my eyes the headache got worse it was so
17213180	17221260	bad i had to go home had to go home i do not remember if they called the hospital or not
17223980	17241820	my uh my uh my mom wasn't very um mom in back then she didn't mom back then um when i was working
17242300	17246940	she didn't want to come get me she had a car at the time and she didn't want to come get me
17247500	17251020	because she was sleeping and i was working late night it was like
17251020	17257260	uh 10 in the morning not 10 in the morning sorry 10 at night or something like that
17258060	17264940	she didn't want to come get me and i worked that late night shift and i was very far away
17264940	17275580	from home so i had to pay like 160 something dollars no i'm reading that it was this it was
17275580	17284860	70 something dollars for a cab to take me home because i couldn't
17286060	17292140	kind of ride it on train or bus or anywhere i can take public transportation
17297980	17301660	so i ended up going home
17301980	17312380	and then i went home and then i just remember being in excruciating pain and i couldn't come
17312380	17319740	into work for the next two days because i wasn't just i don't i can't remember it was really bad
17321500	17326620	it was so bad that my brain is literally blocking out a majority of my memory
17327580	17333340	but it was really bad and then i had to go to the er and the er did a
17334620	17342060	um they wouldn't like uh they wouldn't like really check me out as it was an emergency
17343820	17350940	they wouldn't check me out i went to the er and they were like well since it's like
17351900	17358380	your head and stuff we don't have the equipment to test you for anything
17362940	17364860	we don't have any we can't help you
17367980	17376060	so i was there for like six hours and they had me sitting in a chair and they refused to see me
17376940	17390940	uh and then i remember them giving me pain meds and a referral to go see a professional in that
17390940	17393900	record and i had to wait
17402220	17406700	no they didn't give me pain meds it was after they gave me pain meds after
17407340	17410940	it was after the second trip to the er because i had to go a second time
17411580	17417260	because the pain got even worse it was it was the second trip i went to the er
17417660	17426060	wait after uh so i they referred me to a professional and i had to wait to see the i had to wait
17427820	17436220	three months to see the professional and and while waiting in between that time while waiting
17436220	17443340	i had to go back to the er because i was in too much pain i couldn't sleep i went like days without
17443340	17450380	sleep i was in so much pain to the point where i would pass out just to sleep i'd pass out i would
17450380	17457740	cry i was crying i remember crying crying and crying and wanting it to just end
17459500	17469020	i wow what's that crying i just wanted it over i wanted it to end it was like the worst pain ever
17473500	17482860	i don't think i'll ever experience pain like that ever again and i never want to go through that again
17488460	17491020	am i better now yes don't worry i'm better now
17492060	17497500	what's better now it was just the whole process of all of it and then missing that appointment
17497500	17502860	after three months and then running out of pain meds i ran out of pain meds
17504700	17509020	after the three months and then i had to i had to wait another three months
17510300	17512940	because they didn't want to schedule me any earlier
17514860	17521100	another three months and then the er never gave me another refill for the pain meds so it was in pain again
17521100	17529660	and then for the whole three months and then i finally saw the doctor and he gave me medication and
17530620	17541980	i remember my face swelling like a balloon it was so big my face was massive my head was huge
17542620	17547020	i felt like my eyeballs was gonna pop out of my my fucking head
17547900	17555580	oh gosh i was just remembering it as alice as so much
17555580	17574620	it was it was horrible
17577580	17584220	and then the doctor treated me well he found out i had chronic severe chronic sinusitis
17585580	17590780	i had lymph like what do you call them the lymph nodes or something and some other stuff
17591500	17599020	all up in there i had like everything all of the above it was where i had tissue infected tissue
17599020	17607100	that spread near close to my brain and they said if it was left untreated for another like
17607100	17613740	year or so and more that it probably would have spread to my spine and then maybe eventually
17613740	17617820	became the bigsy so
17624060	17630460	so that mass that i found um they found in my nose wasn't even found during that appointment
17631900	17638940	during that entire timespan the mass that was found in my nose was at a place and no other doctors
17638940	17643980	have heard about they kept sending me to a different place that took x-rays and they were like
17643980	17649900	oh we found a mass in your nose why not probably not that big of a problem and then they gave me
17649900	17656460	like a cd scan or the cat scan or whatever you want to call it they gave me it i remember sleeping
17656460	17661500	in this machine i had to sit in this machine for three hours while they were scanning my face
17661500	17671500	and they uh they didn't find they didn't find anything else just the mass and then uh i went to
17671500	17676860	the doctor and told him about it and then they were like from where did you go and i was like this
17676860	17681980	place and they're like never heard of it so i had to do it all again at a different place
17684220	17687660	and that took two years to do two whole years
17692140	17697740	um you know there's so much and i hope you know how to go through this ad again
17698460	17707820	me too me too not fine though now um then i had my first ever surgery
17709740	17717180	they scheduled me for surgery last year last year february last year february
17718060	17725980	so i have been fine for the past year uh just i was healing a lot uh afterwards there was a lot of
17726700	17733020	a lot of bleeding i couldn't blow my nose i had to be careful with sneezing
17733900	17741340	because if i sneezed it was just red everywhere red red
17741740	17750780	i had to be careful with holding my head down or it would just leak red everywhere red
17754780	17759900	so i had to lay in bed because i was on like heavy medication i just woke up from anesthesia
17759900	17761740	and i was just like laying there like uh
17762060	17771740	i was so nervous i waited so long to get the surgery because they they said they'll wait
17771740	17778860	because they knew i was really scared because he did um the doctor did warn me that it was very
17778860	17787020	close to my brain um that there could be chance that if they were to mess with anything like
17787980	17796300	hit anything that it could affect my personality my emotions and something else and i remember
17797340	17804540	and then they were like then the other doctor i know it's like procedure and i have to tell you
17804540	17808780	that you could possibly you know perish
17809340	17814540	but the way he said it to me scared the living
17815340	17822380	let me shut out of me okay and that's why i waited he scared me so much
17826060	17829900	he was like and death and he gave me a look like
17830620	17833020	oh
17838140	17845020	no we didn't finish the game we're just trying it up we're gonna play the game next week next
17845020	17853020	week on stay that's likely
17853260	17862700	so i was on a bunch of medication for that whole timespan i was on like
17863740	17873260	so much pain meds antibiotics uh stuff for my stomach i was on uh like
17874540	17880540	some some other stuff i don't remember what for so i was on that and then i was on it for
17881340	17887500	uh the headaches because this is before they found out about my spine and my shoulder
17888460	17896300	this is before that so i had that and i was on i i i messed up my knees
17897500	17900140	i had all accident so my knees are messed up
17903660	17909980	i only have physical things wrong with me it's not that bad i know people got it worse so
17910540	17913900	i just went through some really messed up experiences all of these things could have
17913900	17922620	been caught and fixed if the doctors weren't so dismissive of me uh and actually believed me
17922620	17928940	one doctor told me that it was all in my head another doctor told me that uh that i was only
17928940	17935580	coming in for the pain medication they were saying that i was an addict uh another doc another
17935580	17941420	doctor turned me away uh because i came too much too frequently uh because i was in pain
17942780	17955020	um i also had uh the uh i had an ovarian ovarian ovarian cyst on my left ovary that burst
17956940	17962620	i had to call 911 for that one i couldn't walk i couldn't move i couldn't do anything
17962940	17965980	and 911 came and picked me up
17968700	17972700	um uh it did a little
17977900	17984060	i felt it and heard it uh when it did uh when it popped i was taking a massive
17984620	17987820	a mash of shit on the toilet
17990940	17995900	i was i was constipated i was taking a massive
17995900	18005180	massive poop and i strained too hard and all i felt and heard was and i was like ah what was that
18005820	18012860	that was weird and then the pain gradually got worse and i'm like ah
18018460	18020860	and i was like dragging myself on the floor like
18025100	18027260	when my pants down half down
18028060	18033420	i was calling out to my mom
18044460	18051260	wait did you wipe first nothing came out i was straining i said i was constipated nothing came out
18057500	18059260	i was taking the poop
18067340	18074700	then they took a like a like a uh ultrasound of the cyst and it was the size of a tennis ball
18074700	18081340	it was massive it was huge it was like a massive cyst on my on my left ovary it was massive
18081340	18089740	and just like a little bit of it like popped so i was bleeding only inside
18091100	18092620	so i was a well tennis ball
18103820	18108300	they were worried they they had to monitor me i was in the hospital for two days that day
18108380	18115740	they had to monitor me to make sure i didn't like you know bleed out eternally
18116540	18122860	and uh since i'm also like anemic slightly on the borderline uh the more blood i lost
18126460	18132220	it was cold and i was very tired so i had to uh they had to be careful
18133340	18137580	um so they wanted to watch me and monitor me they took so much blood for me
18137580	18140300	that's how they had to monitor me they took so much
18145980	18146700	it was a lot
18154860	18161420	yeah i got to break uh i'm uh i've been through quite a lot over the past couple of years
18162060	18169580	so that's all right though it's what made me me makes me me makes me who i am
18169980	18175820	i suppose pray i'm just very accepting i guess
18179820	18184060	and i have many other stories but we could save those for the other side
18185260	18188380	right now this is just my some of my medical stories
18192060	18195980	so i'm just glad i'm off quite a couple of the meds now i'm not on a lot of them
18195980	18203180	so i'm happy now right i am and i only hope for better things i didn't have a lot of support
18203180	18210460	as i was getting older i had to do everything myself so i guess you could say i matured way too early
18210460	18217500	for my for the age that i was when i was younger i had to do everything myself
18217580	18223660	i had to teach myself many things that many young young girls should definitely have already
18223660	18227420	been taught i had to teach it to myself so yeah
18235340	18241180	wait some yeah because there is a lot of girls that aren't taught these things i mean as in some as in
18241180	18246300	like the glass half full kind of thing i mean there are some girls out there that don't know
18246300	18253420	currently that they're they were like me there's a lot that do know right now i mean some as in
18253420	18260300	there are some girls out there who still right now at this moment still aren't taught about hygiene
18261580	18264300	as they should be taught even now
18277100	18288940	uh i've been there a bit i've had my extreme extreme downs extreme downs my therapist was four
18293980	18300700	we don't talk about those those are not what i'm gonna cover anytime soon maybe like
18301020	18303100	like years later down the line
18322780	18327820	but i also had my ups so i was satisfied i found some people who support me
18328540	18336140	and my endeavors so i'm very happy um and a lot of family issues i've had
18336140	18343660	has been sorted out so yeah i just need to to eventually find a place of my own so i can
18343660	18351900	do my own thing yeah let's go do my own thing yeah i wanted my own thing
18352140	18359500	and i want to pursue this v-tubing thing that i'm doing right now um quite some time
18362140	18365980	it's my uh main source of of living
18374460	18375820	i hope you all understand
18376620	18382860	i am totally understandable i understand
18386860	18388220	thank you i'm glad
18395180	18401580	i know it's less important but i feel like we aren't uh we aren't taught proper hygiene either
18401660	18405260	and i think guys aren't taught proper hygiene either as well
18407980	18415100	i know one thing for for sure is that there are guys who actually truly believe that you don't wipe
18416140	18420380	that you don't need to wipe the the pepe the pepe
18421340	18430380	uh but uh the the the pepe there's there's there's there's actually guys out there who
18430380	18436380	aren't taught that or don't know or other guys taught them not to do it so it's not their fault
18436380	18443900	really but there are guys who teach other guys that i have been around quite a few of them
18444060	18453500	um in the past long long time ago don't talk to them anymore though because they were um
18454220	18456300	they're rude they're rude people
18461500	18469260	but if you are a guy that don't know about wiping you do wipe you do you do a tap tap
18469420	18474780	you could take just one or two squares and do a tap tap you tap it up tap it up tap it up tap
18474780	18481180	up tap up the tip tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap and wipe
18484220	18489500	there's nothing too extremely it's like yes a lot of people might find it gross but it is what it is
18490060	18496460	so don't judge too harshly understand their situations or circumstances that they probably
18496460	18507260	weren't taught
18511580	18512140	it's okay
18515660	18519100	and i understand the little jokies that are made where you know
18519100	18525900	oh yeah people just helicopter it up
18550060	18555260	this is not a joke this is not the sacred ritual i wouldn't know
18560540	18562620	it requires a lot of rhythm
18564780	18569900	i'm working them hips huh we're working them hips
18579100	18588700	it's not just the way but leaving the washroom and not washing hands
18590620	18598700	please please wash your hands please wash your hands i know there are guys who don't
18598700	18608860	who don't even need to use hands hands free but still wash your hands wash them wash
18609100	18614060	your hands you touch the door knobs you touch the doors you had to come into there

18671740	18677020	i know girls that do the same thing a lot of boys don't know this but there are girls
18677020	18683420	that literally don't even like they don't clean up after themselves trust trust
18684380	18688620	don't think just because a lot of girls bathrooms are like super spotless sometimes
18688620	18694140	and has like pretty plants and stuff but those bathrooms are disgusting
18694940	18702860	you see things that you don't want to see don't want to see things left unflushed

18792860	18805860	We do not harshly judge them as they're probably, like I said, not taught, not taught, didn't learn, learned the hard way, self-taught, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
18808860	18815860	I knew of girls that didn't even know about shaving at all, like overall.
18816860	18829860	And it becomes very unhygienic not to shave or trim because if hairs get really long, too long, you can accumulate bacteria and stuff.
18830860	18841860	And women are very susceptible to UTIs, it's easier for women to get them the most.
18842860	18851860	So we gotta take cleanly, like so you take care of your little beddies, take care of your little beddies.
18853860	18867860	It's called a urinary tract infection, you get an infection in the, in your bladder basically, or in the, your, your, your itta.
18868860	18884860	Yeah, guys can get it too, but you guys get less, less chance of them getting it because you know, you guys have a longer ways to getting to the bladder unlike women.
18885860	18895860	Got shorter, shorter ways of getting there, so bacteria can travel faster, easier for women than for men.
18898860	18903860	Is that like guineastones? No.
18904860	18912860	But I think the pain could be similar, the pain could be similar.
18928860	18933860	Oh my god, I'm not gonna read that.
18937860	18941860	Yeah, so hygiene is very important, so make sure you take care of yourself.
18941860	18964860	Yeah, I think you have a fire, we'll take care of it, stay clean in that regard, and you won't have to worry, at least you don't have your, your parents telling you it's gonna fall off.
18972860	18989860	I heard that's what a lot of, a lot of boys got told when they were younger that it was gonna fall off as they don't take care of it.
18990860	18991860	Yeah.
18995860	18997860	And even as a student.
