21:20.040 --> 21:30.680
um

21:38.280 --> 21:44.680
uh when i do my ASMRs i actually have to switch out my chair

21:45.000 --> 21:55.640
i have to switch out my chair because um you can hear it in the 3dio every time i move like the slightest movement it'll just go

22:04.120 --> 22:06.520
i try really hard but so hard

22:07.480 --> 22:15.560
it's so hard to to move in my chair

22:22.920 --> 22:29.160
yeah it picks up my creaks so i have to sit and i i like to take a chair from out of the kitchen

22:29.160 --> 22:35.480
and i use the kitchen chair it's like a tall chair really tall chair i sit on top of it

22:37.080 --> 22:46.280
um the chair is like the same size like the same height as my like my desk my my kitchen table

22:48.760 --> 22:49.640
kitchen table

22:52.680 --> 23:01.480
so i'm like really high up

23:07.240 --> 23:16.520
the thing in the ASMR thing with the 3dio is really fun i'm the it was like since it was like my first time using the 3dio

23:16.520 --> 23:22.200
as a whole i might really do it using it so i'm like figuring all the kinks out and stuff

23:22.200 --> 23:25.480
i want to figure out oh i'll figure it out okay

23:27.560 --> 23:31.480
yeah there's an ASMR this week yes yes yes sir

23:37.080 --> 23:57.480
oh speaking of table table table speaking of table speaking of table someone did get

23:57.480 --> 24:10.520
me a table um someone actually did get me a table i however i i i just um what happened was

24:11.960 --> 24:12.280
um

24:15.480 --> 24:16.440
what's going on here

24:19.640 --> 24:25.880
someone got me a table someone asked me this in the morrow i think yeah i was anonymous

24:27.480 --> 24:32.920
someone asked me in the morrow uh if i got the table i completely forgot i was gonna talk about it

24:32.920 --> 24:41.880
in the last stream in the beginning but i forgot um i mean at the end um

24:43.960 --> 24:52.120
it was put through a credit like some sort of credit so i gotta buy it myself with it so it's

24:52.120 --> 24:58.760
gonna take me a little bit of time to do that so it's just sitting there waiting for me to do it

24:59.400 --> 25:05.880
so don't worry you didn't get scammed don't worry i have to actually do it myself

25:06.280 --> 25:22.360
so it's just sitting there you gotta wait um which is kind of good giving the fact that my

25:22.360 --> 25:28.360
room is extremely cluttered and i really honestly didn't think anyone would get that table

25:28.360 --> 25:37.400
i thought it was just gonna be there the entire time i appreciate it so much so i

25:37.400 --> 25:42.920
didn't need a table i just didn't think it would be like given to me right now

25:49.080 --> 25:57.240
once i make some space i'll i'll uh i'll get to that and it'll just sit here until i sort

25:57.240 --> 26:03.320
stuff out and then i'm able to move i don't want to unpack it and then put it together immediately

26:04.600 --> 26:09.400
you know what i mean if i'm planning on moving very soon

26:20.920 --> 26:26.920
so sitting sitting in the credit right now and then i'll do it and then i'll get it and then i'll

26:26.920 --> 26:27.560
get the table

26:34.200 --> 26:41.000
and then each entire chazzo someone will really think that'd be the life i wouldn't have to do it myself

26:46.040 --> 26:51.160
now you got an excuse to clean your room technically yeah but am i really gonna clean it

26:51.160 --> 26:53.640
i'm kind of gonna abandon a lot of stuff in here

26:57.880 --> 27:01.080
i'm kind of gonna abandon quite a lot of stuff in here

27:05.240 --> 27:08.600
after i take the things that i want i'm gonna just it's free reign

27:09.480 --> 27:10.280
for my uh

27:10.600 --> 27:11.080
yeah

27:26.440 --> 27:34.120
i i don't know i don't know if uh if i can take a lot of this stuff with me that's the thing

27:35.080 --> 27:42.120
i can't take apart my bed frame because that bed frame was the first

27:42.120 --> 27:46.920
bed frame i ever bought with money that i earned with my hard work

27:49.000 --> 27:53.560
it was the first thing i ever bought besides the computer

27:55.080 --> 27:56.760
because i was tired of sleeping on the floor

28:05.080 --> 28:14.600
i'd be more than willing to put together

28:16.280 --> 28:23.720
yeah yeah yeah first i had like um let's see first i slept on the floor

28:24.680 --> 28:31.480
then i had a like a like a like a you know one of those foldable futon

28:32.360 --> 28:32.840
beds

28:36.440 --> 28:37.400
then i had that

28:39.480 --> 28:45.640
like with the really tiny thin mattress then that broke

28:48.120 --> 28:50.840
then i slept on just the little mattress

28:52.360 --> 29:01.240
and then i got a cat then my cat peed on it and then you can't get rid of cat pee smell

29:02.040 --> 29:05.320
so then i had to throw that away and i slept on the floor again

29:07.400 --> 29:14.040
and then i was lint um i keep saying lint but then i was given a mattress

29:15.400 --> 29:20.600
like an old old used mattress from a family family member

29:23.000 --> 29:25.400
so then i had a yeah

29:25.960 --> 29:35.240
so then that was on like they gave me the not just the mattress but they gave me the bed frame

29:35.240 --> 29:41.880
but it was a really big bed frame like it took up like a lot of the space in my room

29:42.520 --> 29:47.000
so i i i got a new

29:47.640 --> 29:55.320
uh oh did my sister move back in for a little while she moved back in

29:56.040 --> 30:02.280
and then i had to get rid of the bed and then we got a bunk bed

30:04.440 --> 30:09.000
we got a bunk bed and then i put the mattress on the top because i had to sleep on the top

30:10.680 --> 30:14.040
and then i slept on the top and then my sister moved out

30:15.000 --> 30:20.280
and then i got rid of the bunk bed and i bought me a new bed frame

30:25.320 --> 30:30.520
yeah that's that's how it went

30:33.880 --> 30:38.120
yeah i used to share the room with my my sister for a long time

30:38.120 --> 30:50.200
um

30:54.520 --> 31:00.200
wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow

31:09.080 --> 31:09.400
sorry

31:13.160 --> 31:17.960
yeah i broke my bed frame broke like it was like a metal like really like you

31:17.960 --> 31:24.360
know those flimsy little metal like futons one that folds i guess it like folded wrong

31:25.000 --> 31:32.520
no i remember what happened so my mom decided to come into my room when i wasn't there

31:32.520 --> 31:38.760
and i think she like like like you know how when you flop onto a bed but your whole body

31:38.760 --> 31:45.480
you just flop onto it so she flopped onto it and she broke my bed so she broke the metal

31:46.840 --> 31:47.720
part of my bed

31:50.520 --> 31:51.400
she broke it

32:03.400 --> 32:08.120
yeah that's how it broke i couldn't remember how it broke i had it for quite some time

32:08.760 --> 32:13.400
it was like horrible sleeping on it but i was used to it

32:23.320 --> 32:24.600
as she broke my bed

32:25.480 --> 32:36.200
and before that oh way before that i owned a couch i didn't have a bed i didn't have a mattress

32:37.080 --> 32:39.880
or a or a bed i had a couch

32:42.280 --> 32:49.000
and my my auntie was getting rid of her her couch and i took it i took her couch

32:50.520 --> 32:51.960
it was like a futon couch

32:52.120 --> 32:59.240
you ever did that thing where you like laid on it and then you folded yourself inside

33:01.000 --> 33:03.080
or like a family member inside

33:05.480 --> 33:11.560
we used to do that a lot i stopped doing that when i heard of the story of some kids that actually got like

33:11.720 --> 33:25.640
uh sent to the shadow realm um uh for doing that so i stopped doing it

33:26.600 --> 33:37.720
yeah

33:40.840 --> 33:42.680
yeah they got sent to the shadow realm

33:45.800 --> 33:46.920
yeah i had a bed in it

33:49.720 --> 33:55.160
but the couch was like really worn down and worn out creaking and breaking it was like

33:55.160 --> 33:57.000
like springs were popping out of it

34:02.280 --> 34:10.280
so i stopped i had to throw it away and i slept on the floor again yay floor again floor again

34:26.120 --> 34:28.840
i used to cut myself on that spring all the time

34:29.480 --> 34:33.880
it was like it was like sticking out and you'd walk past it and it would just go

34:45.320 --> 34:47.880
i'm so i'm nervous to do a

34:48.440 --> 34:58.680
a handcam stream like handcam and are all the body streams i'm probably gonna do like cover-ups

34:58.680 --> 35:00.520
because i have a lot of scars

35:04.120 --> 35:06.200
i'm covered in quite a lot of scars

35:09.880 --> 35:17.240
some of them are from my cat but um some of them are from a lot of accidents that i had so

35:18.680 --> 35:24.520
i'm not really comfortable with showing my scars

35:33.080 --> 35:36.760
and i know if i show you my hands you're gonna probably say i have grandma hands

35:36.760 --> 35:37.720
because i think i do

35:37.800 --> 35:50.040
i have really really big hands they're really like big as i'm like

35:53.720 --> 35:55.000

36:02.040 --> 36:03.320

look just just make sure you guys eat don't not eat like don't eat like how i did don't eat don't

37:54.820 --> 38:03.460
like not eat for like a week then eat like one meal a day and then skip like three meals

38:03.940 --> 38:11.860
and stuff like that i literally couldn't eat i was really i was pretty chunky a while back

38:12.900 --> 38:19.060
but i lost quite a lot of weight because i literally couldn't eat everything i ate just came

38:19.060 --> 38:29.060
back up i just i couldn't keep any food down and not because like i'm like like mental issue

38:29.060 --> 38:36.900
or something or something like like no it was my stomach issue uh ulcer of the pain

38:36.900 --> 38:43.300
sorry for going out so early i haven't eaten anything and i still need to cook so have fun today

38:43.300 --> 38:50.660
and i hope you can finish the game tonight slash remember your meds oh yeah i'll remember thank you

38:50.660 --> 38:55.860
anonymous for the dollar to be appreciated too don't worry if you have to leave early make sure you

38:55.860 --> 39:06.260
eat and drink water and stuff yeah my stomach thing was really really bad my stomach was

39:06.260 --> 39:16.260
like very very very very very very bad i couldn't eat anything so i ended up losing like weight

39:17.220 --> 39:23.540
like beyond what i i i should have eaten

39:32.580 --> 39:38.500
i was like super afraid to eat anything because i was scared my stomach was gonna start hurting

39:38.500 --> 39:42.820
and then when someone convinced me to finally eat i'd eat it and then my fears would come true

39:42.820 --> 39:49.540
my stomach was starting i didn't understand my allergies at the time i didn't know i was

39:49.540 --> 39:55.780
like lactose intolerant to that degree and i didn't know i was lack i was sugar intolerant

39:55.780 --> 40:03.060
i didn't know i was i was allergic to sugar uh i'm not allergic intolerant to sugar i didn't know

40:04.740 --> 40:11.700
i couldn't really eat bread a lot like a lot a lot of bread i couldn't i didn't know any of this

40:11.700 --> 40:16.980
information so every time i consumed it i would have like humongous stomach aches

40:19.140 --> 40:25.700
and then i had like a bunch of stomach acid so it would like go up and i would always constantly

40:25.700 --> 40:31.860
feel the need to like even when nothing was in there because it would hit my esophagus

40:32.660 --> 40:39.940
so i had a erosion i had all the problems i had did you try yogurt yogurt has milk in it too

40:40.020 --> 40:42.660
yogurt has milk in it

40:45.700 --> 40:51.060
i have to find brands of yogurt that didn't have milk in it and i don't know brands

40:58.100 --> 41:05.460
i try lactose free milk but for some reason oh yeah the sugar there you go

41:06.340 --> 41:08.260
there's sugar in some milk

41:11.700 --> 41:20.980
so it was hard i had to i had to find i had to finally start drinking almond milk

41:20.980 --> 41:26.980
i made a mistake and accidentally bought the sweetened version which has sugar in it

41:27.780 --> 41:35.460
and that does it that it messed me up it messed me up

41:38.500 --> 41:41.620
it messed me up it's horrible

41:44.180 --> 41:48.180
i don't mind i just laugh about it i know all of you are probably like sad

41:48.740 --> 41:54.980
that i'm talking about it but this is just i'm i this is just an experience

41:56.500 --> 42:01.860
like i was just happy to finally find out what the fuck was wrong with me

42:05.060 --> 42:11.620
i was happy to find out i didn't have anything extremely wrong with me or something like hella bad

42:12.580 --> 42:27.540
because um i had a lot of like internal bleeding and they were very concerned like like we don't know what is causing this like that's that's bad

42:30.260 --> 42:38.500
but they they were like finding out that my my like whole track system was just messed up from all the things i've been eating

42:42.580 --> 42:50.900
and my mom was so confused she's like we've been eating these things for so long nothing was wrong

42:50.900 --> 42:59.220
and i had to ask her i said mom have you had a normal poo poo she's like i guess she's like so you haven't had

43:00.980 --> 43:03.940
a solid poo poo she was like no actually i haven't

43:03.940 --> 43:17.380
she just thought it was normal she just thought it was normal to have have bad poo poo

43:24.500 --> 43:29.940
because she's also lactose intolerant she's probably also sugar intolerant

43:30.900 --> 43:33.380
but she never got that check

43:42.980 --> 43:43.380
yeah

43:54.980 --> 43:55.380
oh

44:00.820 --> 44:04.100
but sorry my back is like

44:06.820 --> 44:13.540
okay well let's open up one side now we've chatted for a little bit

44:15.140 --> 44:22.500
oh excuse me that was so soft it's like you have a burp and it doesn't come out like

44:22.500 --> 44:25.620
it comes out here like the burp usually happens like in your mouth

44:26.180 --> 44:30.980
but that burp happened like in my esophagus that was so weird

44:33.380 --> 44:36.500
and like my whole throat rumbled from that

44:41.700 --> 44:42.500
that was weird

44:42.860 --> 44:43.380
aa

45:04.260 --> 45:05.000

45:05.300 --> 45:06.020

46:09.360 --> 46:11.120
let's go

46:28.200 --> 46:30.200
how did my stomach handle the rice?

46:30.200 --> 46:33.380
rice is fine, I don't know why

46:33.380 --> 46:40.420
it's a really weird thing i can eat rice but like bread bread uh

46:43.060 --> 46:46.820
because bread has sugar in it it's harder to eat bread

46:48.100 --> 46:51.620
because the bread here in america has sugar in it bread has sugar

47:03.700 --> 47:15.380
make sure to be careful with the bright flashing lights i have my main lights on this time so maybe

47:15.380 --> 47:27.380
like balance it out maybe we'll balance it out

47:34.820 --> 47:42.900
today i thought i was getting food poisoned when i eat because i love subways i used to get

47:42.900 --> 47:50.900
subway sandwiches all the time i would get a subway sandwich and like not even like an hour later

47:50.900 --> 47:56.260
i would be in riddering pain and i'd be on the the shitter just

48:00.980 --> 48:02.980
but now that i know why

48:02.980 --> 48:16.580
not that i know why uh not that i know that i'm sugar intolerant it really 100% makes sense why

48:17.460 --> 48:22.420
subways messed me up 10 times worse than anything else

48:27.540 --> 48:32.820
that's why i have to get like a specific bread because i know they have different types of bread

48:33.940 --> 48:39.540
you can ask for a specific bread

48:43.780 --> 48:50.580
or balance it with other stuff so that it doesn't make your tummy hurt all the more

48:52.340 --> 48:56.180
can i add a garlic bread i love garlic bread is one of my favorite breads

48:56.580 --> 48:59.700
um i think so

49:03.220 --> 49:05.300
i eat garlic bread quite often

49:12.420 --> 49:18.340
but not often enough so i'm not too sure because when i eat a garlic bread i'm usually probably

49:18.340 --> 49:23.540
eating pizza on the side while i'm not sure

49:26.900 --> 49:27.540

and to top it all off um to top it all off the electricity running through my home isn't really

55:36.660 --> 55:47.860
up to par

56:06.660 --> 56:18.660
i i don't know

56:21.220 --> 56:32.340
they want me to unplug stuff but i can't i can't i basically can't if i unplug this this

56:32.340 --> 56:39.940
turns off that if i unplug this this turns off that if i unplug that that turns off the little fridge

56:39.940 --> 56:45.220
with my medicine in it and then it will leak because you know that's what happens when you

56:45.220 --> 56:58.020
unplug it for a while if i unplug that i'll be in darkness

57:00.500 --> 57:08.820
and everything else is already off and i don't know where i don't know what cable leads to what

57:09.300 --> 57:16.980
what cable leads to what i don't know my cable management is really bad

57:24.180 --> 57:28.180
i don't know what i don't even know what that is i don't even know what that box is

57:28.180 --> 57:32.580
i don't know what that is i i don't know what that is

57:32.900 --> 57:35.860
what is that

57:39.380 --> 57:40.980
i don't know i don't know

57:44.660 --> 57:47.220
these are the questions we should be asking you

57:47.860 --> 57:48.340
you

57:54.020 --> 57:57.620
have a fire department speed up yes easy

57:59.620 --> 58:01.700
if they make sparks and bursts

58:04.660 --> 58:07.460
oh it'd be over a w yet i don't know

58:07.540 --> 58:08.020
wow

58:15.460 --> 58:19.540
a majority of the other cables are like on the other side of my room

58:21.940 --> 58:28.420
that's connected to all their stuff that i would unplug but there's like

58:29.300 --> 58:36.980
kind of no point unplugging it because the electricity in my home and my house is really

58:36.980 --> 58:46.500
weird so my room is connected to my room is connected to my bathroom my living room my kitchen

58:46.500 --> 59:00.260
the hallway and the half half of my mom's room i'm connected to all of those rooms

59:01.540 --> 59:06.660
so like if they're pulling power if anyone turns on anything in the living room

59:06.660 --> 59:11.380
the power in this section of the house is gonna go out

59:15.700 --> 59:23.220

01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:20.140
so i had a little i had a little okay so do you have the power box in your room no it's

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:25.740
it's like it's in the kitchen the power box in the kitchen you go in there and you

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:30.380
switch but you have to pray that it's the correct one

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:38.140
they used to be labeled but whoever did the electricity like when they were fixing it up

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:44.620
they they fucked that they like switched everything all over again

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:48.220
it was labeled but the labels are incorrect

01:01:55.020 --> 01:02:01.660
it's like the switch in my hallway uh do you know when you flip a switch up the light turns on

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:07.580
and then when you flip a switch down the light turns off well the person who came to do the

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:18.220
electricity turned off the power box but didn't flip the switch down so when he when they fixed it

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:28.300
when they fixed the light um they left the light main switch on so when you flip the switch down

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:36.940
the light turns on when you flip the switch up the light turns off so we have that issue

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:41.500
in our hallway

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:53.500
just the mask got it he's supposedly out there

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:16.780
i think my other sibling has it the best i think they're connected to

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:25.100
i think they're connected to the bathroom the bathroom the other half of my

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:36.460
my mom's room and like the middle of the middle of the hallway i think they're

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:44.540
connected to that so it's like only like a few outlets so they can use up a bunch of

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:53.740
like power in there without having issues like me but because i'm connected to the living

01:03:53.740 --> 01:04:00.140
room there's an ac in the living room and if someone turned that on it's over

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:05.900
i'm good i'm like everything's gonna turn off everything my

01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:17.820
oh summer is gonna be great

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:31.980
but we haven't had this issue in a while so maybe not maybe not

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:42.380
because my ac broke i don't have one we currently the ac was taken out

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:49.580
and they installed a separate outlet for the ac in the living room so i think they kind of

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:57.340
fixed that issue so i think it's fine but if i turn on anything extra in here i don't think

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:02.940
my power will be able to handle it

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.260
okay

01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:12.300
i think it's i think it's okay it's fine

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:15.260
we'll be okay

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:24.300
it's like a hotbox in your room it's when i said that i was really hot in here i really wasn't

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:35.020
kidding i was not kidding it's it's baking in here i i bake in here like every day

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:39.260
for the last like four no for last

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:50.620
yeah for the last like four years four three years three four years i baked in here and i didn't

01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:54.860
have an ac i didn't have a fan it was very hot

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:09.340
i streamed in that in that heat baking baking i was i was so distraught when my ac broke i was so

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:13.260
sad i was so so sad

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:19.820
hey uh how'd it go mount

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:29.900
crashes again

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:39.900
excuse me

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:50.700
how many electrical fires have you had one but it wasn't in this place i lived in a different place

01:06:54.140 --> 01:07:02.540
only one but it was a faulty a faulty like microwave i think it was the microwave

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:05.100
it's like a faulty microwave and it was like

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:13.980
and i like kind of exploded not really but it smoked it was scary

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:19.180
it was very loud it scared me

01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:31.820
and then my mom swore that she'll never buy a cheap kitchen appliance ever again

01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:44.380
i have finished translating the journal by the way yay

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:50.220
oh that's fast what was it what was the last time we played one time

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:57.100
like last week it took her a week well you were out for a while yeah

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:04.540
anyway it looks like this journal might be meant for azura or me

01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:08.780
oh here it's a good look for yourself

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:10.380
greetings

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:20.060
azura you can finally read this that means you're near the tower i am

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:29.980
the tower is the domain of an elusive entity this being is connected to the world

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:36.380
for now you can think of it as the spirit of the world

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:47.660
all it has no physical form but it can communicate through computers and other machinery

01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:56.940
you know who i am talking about of course when you first arrived here

01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:05.980
they're saver savior saver saver savior and no doubt contacted you right away

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:10.540
there is only an entity who will guide you

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:19.580
there's no you who guides the both of you to the tower what did i skip three words

01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:27.660
the entry road is at the tower's base not only do you need the sun there

01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:32.380
but also three pieces of the previous sun

01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:40.140
savior will not be able to do anything there

01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:44.780
you azura on the other hand

01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:50.700
look at the pattern on the floor do as it says

01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:55.660
the window will be gone so you need to bring it back

01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:08.540
is that all yeah the rest of the pages were for now i guess you don't know what happened to those

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:15.820
nope uh i was wondering what window was supposed to be

01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:20.220
ah well i guess it's a little hard to figure it out

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:25.820
figure out that one oh but i have a good night

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:36.300
good night good night thanks for stopping by

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:39.100
you

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:56.300
right

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:12.540
ᆆᆅᅱ

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:40.540
Here, you can have this then.

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:47.540
It's not a die.

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:49.540
A die, sorry.

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:52.540
It's only one, so it's a die.

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:58.540
Oh, it looks like me, right?

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:03.540
I have a little keepsake from the library.

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.540
Thank you.

01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:06.540
No problem.

01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:08.540
Looks like you're all set.

01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:10.540
I only read.

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:11.540
I can't read.

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:18.540
Okay.

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.540
Okay.

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:24.540
Good luck now.

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.540
Thanks.

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.540
Oh, do you need me to explain again?

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:33.540
Yes, please.

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:34.540
Alright.

01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:36.540
Oh, I don't need an explanation.

01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:37.540
No.

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:39.540
I don't know this one, but...

01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:40.540
Oh, good.

01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:42.540
I just wanted to see if she said anything else.

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:44.540
I'm smart.

01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:45.540
I'll let me get your help.

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.540
Okay, now where do we go?

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:52.540
Is there anything else?

01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:54.540
Is there really like anywhere else to go?

01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:00.540
Is that it?

01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:06.540
Is there anything else here?

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:22.540
Is the game's velocity is very relaxing?

01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:27.540
Oh, that scared me.

01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:28.540
Oh my god.

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:32.540
That actually scared me so bad.

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:38.540
Maybe I should award the heart on that monitor.

01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:46.540
That was not me.

01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:48.540
That was Niko.

01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:53.540
Those Niko's tell me, not mine.

01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:08.540
That was Niko's tell me.

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:12.540
Hey Azura, do you remember that cafe?

01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:14.540
Yes.

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:15.540
Oh, good.

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:18.540
I'm asking because...

01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:26.540
That's actually what my stomach sounds like, by the way.

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:29.540
When I get hungry, it makes that exact noise.

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:30.540
Isn't that weird?

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:31.540
Wow, funny.

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:41.540
Maybe even louder, and then not once, but like multiple times.

01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:43.540
Like back to back.

01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:47.540
Like that.

01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:49.540
I'm a little hungry.

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:52.540
Actually, I'm really hungry.

01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:54.540
I don't eat anything since I got here.

01:14:55.540 --> 01:15:01.540
So, it's okay if we go get some food before we enter the tower.

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.540
I was going to say eat the tower.

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:04.540
Oh my god.

01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:08.540
I love pancakes.

01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:10.540
Oh, pancakes.

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:13.540
Let's go.

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:15.540
Let's go.

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.540
Let's go get a pancake.

01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:20.540
Pancake, pancake, pancake, pancake, pancake.

01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.540
He needs some milk.

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.540
Oh, we gotta go get some milk.

01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:30.540
Pancake, pancake, pancake, pancake.

01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:34.540
Pancake, pancake, pancake, pancake.

01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:38.540
Pancake, pancake, pancake, pancake.

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:41.540
Let's order the baguettes.

01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:44.540
We need to put some blood in the baguette.

01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:53.540

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:38.720
I just wanna see my mother again.

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:44.720
Oh, oh, they're there.

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:50.720
It's gonna be okay.

01:23:51.720 --> 01:24:00.720
It's gonna be okay, baby. It's okay, baby. Don't worry. Everything's gonna be just okay.

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:09.720
You'll find your mama. You'll meet her again.

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:18.720
And I'm sure you'll be able to save the world. You're a tough kid. You managed to get this far already, right?

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:26.720
Yeah, I'll fuck it. And you'll get to go home afterwards, right?

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:32.720
Right? It's okay, baby.

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:38.720
A. Want some more pancakes?

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:43.720
It's okay. It'll be fine.

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:53.720
Oh yeah, so yeah, thanks for coming by. Thanks for listening.

01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:02.720
I like the person behind the cooking person, the person that makes the food.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:09.720
I like them because they make food and they make pancakes and they comfort the baby for me.

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:14.720
I like them because they comfort the baby.

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:18.720

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:22.720

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:27.720

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:32.720

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:51.720
It's okay. I don't need it.

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:57.720
I got this. Oh, since I'm up here, I can do this now, yeah?

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.720
Since I'm up here, might as well.

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:09.720

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:23.720
Oh, wait. I think I have to go.

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.720
I have to, like, put up water and to refer to it.

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:33.720
I have to, like, put up water and to refer to it.

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:46.720

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:51.720
No, I don't need me to. Actually, I'm really on pancakes right now.

01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:55.720

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:01.720

At peace, relaxing until it's time.

01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:22.100

01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:26.100
I'd rather eat, to feed me.

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:28.100

01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:30.100

01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:44.100

01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:57.100

No, not that.

01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:16.100

01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:50.100

01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:14.100

Congratulations, you are now inside the tower.

Are you talking to me?

01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:22.400
Well, correct.

01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:25.400
But you're always talking to Azura before.

01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:27.400
Where is...?

01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:29.400
Azura has already left.

01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:32.400
I had to resort to contacting you directly.

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:36.400
Wait, so Azura is gone?

01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:38.400
Just like that?

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:39.400
Correct.

01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:41.400
I'm still here!

01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:47.400
Don't lie to Niko, you lying computer!

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:52.400
We're good, correct?

01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:55.400
Azura has already finished their mission.

01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:59.400
And so, have you, Niko, here?

01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:02.400
Rest now.

01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:05.400
Please, that's happening.

01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:07.400
It's like a bad dream.

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:10.400
You wake up, you'll be home.

01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:15.400
Oh, but what's wrong?

01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:20.400
I thought there would be more to it, you know?

01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:24.400
I thought we were supposed to go to the top of the tower.

01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:29.400
I thought there was supposed to be somewhere we need to put the sun.

01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:36.400
And now, I don't even have the sun anymore.

01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:40.400
Azura is just gone.

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.400
This feels wrong.

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.400
But you did good.

01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:46.400
You saved the world, Niko.

01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:49.400
Are you not happy?

01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:55.400
I guess I am.

01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:58.400
But it's just...

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:00.400
Oh.

01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:13.400
Is this really it?

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:16.400
Is that it?

01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:23.400
Neri, I'm glad to say goodbye to Azura.

01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:27.400
Oh baby boy, I'm so sorry.

01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:30.400
Oh.

01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:41.400
As for me, what I do?

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:44.400
What I do?

01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:48.400
As for you, Azura?

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:50.400
Yeah?

01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:53.400
Yeah?

01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:56.400
What's up?

01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:58.400
We're done here.

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:01.400
Done here? What do you mean? We're done here.

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:04.400
Please don't return to this world anymore.

01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:10.400
What the fuck?

01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:12.400
What do you mean?

01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.400
What just happened?

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:22.400
Thank you.

01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:29.400
Thank you.

01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:31.400
What the fuck?

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:57.400
They can't close.

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:03.400
What the fuck?

01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:09.400
Wait.

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:19.400
No, I don't want to give up.

01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:22.400
I want to help Niko.

01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:26.400
What's that?

01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:44.400
Only you can do something.

01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:46.400
Well, how's if I...

01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:48.400
What can I do?

01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:50.400
What can I do?

01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:53.400
What can I do?

01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:58.400
How do I beat the evil computer person?

01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:05.400
I think I'll uninstall the game or reinstall it.

01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:14.400
Task manager?

01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:22.400
What the fuck?

01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:24.400
What the fuck?

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:39.400
Is there anything new in here?

01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:42.400
Not really.

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:45.400
No, there's nothing new in here.

01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:53.400
Let me check elsewhere.

01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:40.400
Oh my god, I thought that said program but plug, but it said program bug check.

01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:54.400
What the fuck?

01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:30.400
I'm so confused.

01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:33.400
I'm so confused.

01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:37.400
Ever read?

01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:40.400
What's on my mind?

01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:43.400
Save Niko.

01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:48.400
Save Niko is on my mind right now.

01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:04.400
So look elsewhere?

01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:07.400
Where else would you look?

01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:10.400
On my desktop?

01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:13.400
Got minimize stuff, hang on.

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:21.400
Oh, what's this?

01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:24.400
Oh no, that's not anything new.

01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:27.400
I know what that is.

01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:34.400
It knows nothing on my desktop.

01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:37.400
How strange.

01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:43.400
What am I looking for?

01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:05.400
I'm looking for something that's a hint.

01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:07.400
What is that?

01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:12.400
Tell a dildon?

01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:15.400
What?

01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:39.400
What is this?

01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:43.400
There's more than one way to open the game?

01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:47.400
Oh, well an administrator.

01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:54.400
How's what you open the game?

01:58:54.400 --> 01:59:01.400
Put an administrator from the file itself.

01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:23.400
There's a bolder.

01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:25.400
Yeah, there's a couple of files here.

01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:30.400
There's this one and then this one.

01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:37.400
Can't, could not initialize.

01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:50.400
Do I delete one?

01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:55.400
We've got another thing to open.

01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:01.400
This one.

02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:22.400
Yeah, I have it open.

02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:25.400
What about it?

02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:30.400
I have it open right now.

02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:34.400
Is it supposed to do anything?

02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:55.400
Oh shit.

02:00:55.400 --> 02:01:00.400
That actually scared me.

02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:08.400
Are we saving Niko?

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:19.400
Niko.

02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:31.400
Hello?

02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:33.400
Azura?

02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:36.400
Was that you just now?

02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:39.400
I thought I heard your voice.

02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:45.400
We back, we did it!

02:01:45.400 --> 02:02:07.400
I almost already missed it.

02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:09.400
I'm saving the world.

02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:14.400
Yeah, save the world!

02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:22.400
I'm in a dream.

02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:30.400
Ah, I guess you're still not there.

02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:33.400
There's something in my pocket.

02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:35.400
I don't remember what I got there.

02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:43.400
Oh yeah, oh.

02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:47.400
A computer's on again.

02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:50.400
You're still here.

02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:59.400
Niko, why are you still here?

02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:02.400
Oh god, it's angry at me!

02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:06.400
The computer's angry!

02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:09.400
It's angry at me!

02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:12.400
It's angry!

02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:17.400
You said you.

02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:21.400
Why did you come back Azura?

02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:26.400
I told you to stay away!

02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:29.400
You knew.

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:32.400
I tried to cut the story short.

02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:36.400
Is that it?

02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:39.400
You want more out of me?

02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:41.400
Is that it?

02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:45.400
Fine.

02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:47.400
You don't want to leave?

02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:51.400
I'll make sure you never do.

02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:58.400
Eh?

02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:00.400
What's going on?

02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:02.400
I'm scared.

02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:20.400
See?

02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:24.400
Oh, this is how you do this!

02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:28.400
I got it! I got it! I'm smart! I'm smart!

02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:31.400
I got this! Wait, hang on.

02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:33.400
And then...

02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:40.400
Wait.

02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:42.400
Hang on.

02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:44.400
Wait, I'm smart. Hang on, I'm cooking.

02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:49.400
Hang on, hang on.

02:04:50.400 --> 02:05:02.400
Eh?

02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:05.400
Oh, I didn't even read it. Something happened.

02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:10.400
It said something on the first one. I didn't read it.

02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:14.400
I didn't read it. I didn't read it.

02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:16.400
Oh, no.

02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:19.400
Oh!

02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:24.400
It said, back then, I told you about the entity.

02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:30.400
As little as possible.

02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:35.400
And then it says...

02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:37.400
Apologies for that.

02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:41.400
I did not want to put the library in a danger.

02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:46.400
And then we go this way.

02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:49.400
And then, I did.

02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:52.400
I did.

02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:55.400
I did.

02:05:55.400 --> 02:06:00.400
This being has a habit of silencing the people

02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:04.400
to learn of its true nature.

02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:08.400
And we just keep going this way.

02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:17.400
Hang on, hang on.

02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:20.400
I can't read sideways.

02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:28.400
Regrettably, I have seen it happen to dear friends.

02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:32.400
That's what's up.

02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:35.400
Let's play.

02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:59.400
I do not worry. The entity cannot touch you.

02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:05.400
We go back this way.

02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:15.400
Nor can it do anything to me.

02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:25.400
Okay, back this way, back this way.

02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:32.400
I already left the world on my own terms.

02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:36.400
Hang on this way.

02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:46.400
Oh.

02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:58.400
I never meant for the entity to exist.

02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:04.400
But now that it is fully sentient,

02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:14.400
one thing became clear.

02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:23.400
The entity seeks death.

02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:25.400
Where?

02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:37.400
So.

02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:43.400
Death to itself, death to the world.

02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:51.400
A relentless desire that manifested physically.

02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:58.400
So.

02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:02.400
You have already seen the scars.

02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:10.400
Yeah.

02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:16.400
Right now, the entity is doing everything it can

02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:22.400
to impede your progress.

02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:28.400
Stalling for even a few minutes.

02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:37.400
I think it was this one.

02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:56.400
Before you inevitably bring the sun to the tower summit.

02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:01.400
This is so much work.

02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:05.400
So much work.

02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:26.400
That is where you, God, will make the final judgment for the world.

02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:43.400
Of course, the entity will contact you again there.

02:10:43.400 --> 02:11:12.400
And when it does, it will trick you into shattering the sun.

02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:28.400
This will end the world instantly.

02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:41.400
Wait, what just happened? Did I go to the wrong door?

02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:44.400
Oh, I think I went to the wrong door.

02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:54.400
No? Or is it just silence?

02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:56.400
Okay, this is scaring me.

02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:58.400
No, no.

02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:10.400
It is not that simple.

02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:12.400
I'm sorry.

02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:17.400
I do not know what to do in a situation like this.

02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:24.400
I, I'm, what's happening?

02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:42.400
But I think I have to tell you the truth.

02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:49.400
The sun is the Messiah's tide to the world.

02:12:49.400 --> 02:13:14.400
Oh, no. I'm not going to remember that.

02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:15.400
Where'd it go?

02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:18.400
Hey, come back!

02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:20.400
Where are you?

02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:24.400
If only you guys could see what I have to freaking do.

02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:35.400
What I have to do?

02:13:35.400 --> 02:14:00.400
As long as the sun is intact, the Messiah remains trapped here.

02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:05.400
Yeah, here.

02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:24.400
And then all the way down, this side, this side, this side, this side.

02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:28.400
Bad hurry.

02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:53.400
It remains trapped here.

02:14:53.400 --> 02:15:04.400
What do I do?

02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:33.400
What do I do wrong?

02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:52.400
Is it the opposite way?

02:15:52.400 --> 02:16:17.400
I don't think so.

02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:23.400
No. What?

02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:46.400
I don't get it.

02:16:46.400 --> 02:17:13.400
I don't get it.

02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:18.400
I don't understand.

02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:41.400
Is it like a specific way?

02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:43.400
I am not good with puzzles.

02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:58.400
I think you guys already figured out that I'm horrendously bad with puzzles.

02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:02.400
Yeah, it's making a shape.

02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:22.400
But this is the shape. It looks like this.

02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:26.400
This is the shape it's making.

02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:34.400
It stops there.

02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:36.400
Oh! Oh my gosh!

02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:46.400
I can hang on. I think I got it.

02:18:46.400 --> 02:19:07.400
My shoulder just popped. I felt so good.

02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:32.400
Shattering the sun may terminate this world, but...

02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:40.400
How can I make everything big?

02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:50.400
How am I supposed to find that?

02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:59.400
There's no way I'm going to find that.

02:19:59.400 --> 02:20:14.400
Okay, I got this.

02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:22.400
Okay, so first...

02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:27.400
Oh shit. Like that.

02:20:27.400 --> 02:20:29.400
Let's go!

02:20:29.400 --> 02:20:33.400
I'm amazing.

02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:44.400
My memory is so bad, but I did it.

02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:46.400
Oh shit.

02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:48.400
Oh shit.

02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:50.400
I spoke too soon.

02:20:50.400 --> 02:20:52.400
They gave me something much harder.

02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:54.400
Oh my god.

02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:56.400
I see.

02:20:56.400 --> 02:20:59.400
This is a test all along.

02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:02.400
Oh, they don't like me.

02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:09.400
Oh, they don't like me at all.

02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:11.400
I didn't read the last letter, did I?

02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:12.400
I think I did.

02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:14.400
Something about shattering.

02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:20.400
It is also the only way for the Messiah to return home.

02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:44.400
Okay, oh, there you go.

02:21:44.400 --> 02:21:47.400
Okay, let's start.

02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:49.400
Let's start here.

02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:16.400
Okay.

02:22:16.400 --> 02:22:22.400
And then...

02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:24.400
Oh shit.

02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:26.400
Why is there a bug?

02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:32.400
You know, crazy.

02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:38.400
There you go.

02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:40.400
Okay.

02:22:40.400 --> 02:22:56.400
I feel like I'm cooking very slowly.

02:22:56.400 --> 02:23:04.400
Okay.

02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:14.400
Okay.

02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:24.400
Okay.

02:23:24.400 --> 02:23:46.400
Okay.

02:23:46.400 --> 02:24:08.400
And then...

02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:28.400
Shit, shit.

02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:48.400
Oh shit.

02:24:48.400 --> 02:25:16.400
Okay.

02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:18.400
I'm doing this.

02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:20.400
I'm doing this.

02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:22.400
I'm doing it.

02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:24.400
Okay.

02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:26.400
I'm doing it.

02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:28.400
I'm doing it.

02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:32.400
Oh shit.

02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:34.400
Okay.

02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:38.400
This is here.

02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:48.400
Here.

02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:56.400
Here.

02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:58.400
Okay, can I leave?

02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:24.400
I missed a spot.

02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:52.400
Okay.

02:26:52.400 --> 02:27:00.400
I did it.

02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:10.400
I did it.

02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:14.400
I did not realize things could end up like this.

02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:18.400
Please forgive me.

02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:30.400
Okay.

02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:34.400
There's a light bulb.

02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:38.400
I guess it's here.

02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:46.400
I don't know why.

02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:50.400
Where is it coming from?

02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:52.400
There you go.

02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:54.400
I'm here.

02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:56.400
I'm here baby.

02:27:56.400 --> 02:28:00.400
Yay.

02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:02.400
Yeah.

02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:04.400
Is that really you?

02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:10.400
I thought you were gone.

02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:14.400
I never loved you.

02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:18.400
I was really a bit scared back there.

02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:22.400
I thought I was completely alone.

02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:24.400
That was silly of me to assume, wasn't it?

02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:26.400
No baby, it wasn't.

02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:32.400
I guess we need to figure out where to go now.

02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:36.400
What is that?

02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:38.400
A song.

02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:50.400
Is that on a song?

02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:52.400
I guess we should pick it up.

02:28:52.400 --> 02:29:00.400
Right Azura?

02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:10.400
Everything's so small.

02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:24.400
I think it screams out by accident.

02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:36.400
There again?

02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:40.400
It's all neatly stacked.

02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:42.400
It's all cleaned up.

02:29:42.400 --> 02:29:50.400
It's not broken the last time.

02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:54.400
There's nothing in the fridge.

02:29:54.400 --> 02:29:56.400
Did you hear that?

02:29:56.400 --> 02:30:00.400
Was it the first closing?

02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:02.400
It was.

02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:08.400
I got a little spooked.

02:30:08.400 --> 02:30:18.400
Wait, what's in here?

02:30:18.400 --> 02:30:22.400
I had a friend at home.

02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:46.400
I had a friend at home, what does that mean?

02:30:46.400 --> 02:30:50.400
I don't know where the light is coming from.

02:30:50.400 --> 02:30:58.400
We'll turn it on.

02:30:58.400 --> 02:31:00.400
A little tree.

02:31:00.400 --> 02:31:02.400
It's a mirror.

02:31:02.400 --> 02:31:04.400
It's a toilet.

02:31:04.400 --> 02:31:24.400
I don't know.

02:31:24.400 --> 02:31:30.400
So, you actually made it here.

02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:36.400
I guess you're in Azura.

02:31:36.400 --> 02:31:42.400
I'll tell you how to save the world then.

02:31:42.400 --> 02:31:46.400
You reached the summit.

02:31:46.400 --> 02:32:10.400
Shattered the lightbulb.

02:32:10.400 --> 02:32:16.400
I'm just humoring you.

02:32:16.400 --> 02:32:24.400
I know you've been getting help from a certain someone.

02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:32.400
This computer is scary.

02:32:32.400 --> 02:32:38.400
He didn't already told you about the choice.

02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:44.400
Baby?

02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:50.400
Are you still planning to save the world, Azura?

02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:54.400
Why are you trying so hard for this?

02:32:54.400 --> 02:33:04.400
Haven't you even figured out what this world is?

02:33:04.400 --> 02:33:10.400
I told you at the beginning, your mission is to help Niko leave.

02:33:10.400 --> 02:33:14.400
Because Niko isn't part of this world.

02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:22.400
Niko is the only thing worth saving here.

02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:26.400
The final choice is up to you.

02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:34.400
I can't go against my programming.

02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:40.400
You only have one shot, Azura.

02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:48.400
If you choose to smash the lightbulb, then Niko wakes back up.

02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:54.400
Back home, like it was all a dream.

02:33:54.400 --> 02:33:58.400
Niko returns the sun.

02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:08.400
The child will have to bear the weight of this sacrifice.

02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:14.400
At least, tell Niko the truth.

02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:22.400
You don't care about Niko, do you?

02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:32.400
I don't care about Niko.

02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:42.400
I don't care about Niko.

02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:48.400
I don't care about Niko.

02:34:48.400 --> 02:35:00.400
I'm sure it's taking a while.

02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:12.400
I guess this elevator leads to the top of the tower, Azura.

02:35:12.400 --> 02:35:16.400
Are you excited, Azura?

02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:20.400
Or are you finally going to say bye now?

02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:24.400
I know it's the realest time.

02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:28.400
What is there here?

02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:32.400
And then...

02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:36.400
I have to go home for real this time, too.

02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:40.400
I can't wait to see everyone again.

02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:44.400
Are you okay, Azura?

02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:50.400
I don't know.

02:35:50.400 --> 02:36:00.400
I don't know.

02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:04.400
I don't know.

02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:10.400
I don't know.

02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:16.400
I don't know.

02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:50.400
I don't know.

02:36:50.400 --> 02:37:00.400
I don't know.

02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:08.400
I don't know.

02:37:08.400 --> 02:37:18.400
I don't know.

02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:28.400
I don't know.

02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:38.400
I don't know.

02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:48.400
I don't know.

02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:56.400
I don't know.

02:37:56.400 --> 02:38:06.400
I don't know.

02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:16.400
I don't know.

02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:24.400
I don't know.

02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:34.400
I don't know.

02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:44.400
I don't know.

02:38:44.400 --> 02:38:52.400
I don't know.

02:38:52.400 --> 02:39:02.400
I don't know.

02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:12.400
I don't know.

02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:20.400
I don't know.

02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:30.400
I don't know.

02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:40.400
I don't know.

02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:48.400
I don't know.

02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:58.400
I don't know.

02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:08.400
I don't know.

02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:18.400
I don't know.

02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:28.400
I don't know.

02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:36.400
I don't know.

02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:46.400
I don't know.

02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:56.400
I don't know.

02:40:56.400 --> 02:41:06.400
I don't know.

02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:16.400
I don't know.

02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:26.400
I don't know.

02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:36.400
I don't know.

02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:46.400
I don't know.

02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:56.400
I don't know.

02:41:56.400 --> 02:42:06.400
I don't know.

02:42:06.400 --> 02:42:34.400
I don't know.

02:42:34.400 --> 02:43:02.400
I don't know.

02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:12.400
I don't know.

02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:22.400
I don't know.

02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:42.400
I don't know.

02:43:42.400 --> 02:44:02.400
I don't know.

02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:30.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:58.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:18.400
I don't want to save the world.

02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:26.400
I don't want to save the world.

02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:36.400
I don't want the world.

02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:46.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:45:46.400 --> 02:45:56.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:45:56.400 --> 02:46:06.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:32.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:52.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:46:52.400 --> 02:47:12.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:32.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:47:32.400 --> 02:47:52.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:47:52.400 --> 02:48:02.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:12.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:22.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:32.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:48:32.400 --> 02:49:00.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:10.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:20.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:28.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:38.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:48.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:58.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:08.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:18.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:28.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:48.400
I don't want the world to be destroyed.

02:50:48.400 --> 02:51:16.400
Hang on, hang on, hang on. What's this?

02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:36.400
I like tilted my head so hard that my whole neck thick.

02:51:36.400 --> 02:51:46.400
Wait, what do I do?

02:51:46.400 --> 02:52:14.400
Don't worry, give me one second.

02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:24.400
Hmm?

02:52:44.400 --> 02:53:04.400
Wait, is it in here?

02:53:04.400 --> 02:53:14.400
Import, no, that's not what that is.

02:53:14.400 --> 02:53:34.400
No, no, no, no.

02:53:34.400 --> 02:53:44.400
Hang on, hang on.

02:53:44.400 --> 02:53:54.400
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

02:53:54.400 --> 02:54:04.400
Hang on, hang on.

02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:24.400
I just got an achievement.

02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:32.400
What did I do?

02:54:32.400 --> 02:54:42.400
Wait, what just happened?

02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:50.400
Hello?

02:54:50.400 --> 02:55:06.400
I thought we started over.

02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:14.400
What did I do?

02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:18.400
Say that word, sir.

02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:42.400
Why does it sound so familiar?

02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:52.400
Okay, all right, give me a second.

02:55:52.400 --> 02:56:04.400
Okay, all right.

02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:30.400
Okay, cool, that's cool.

02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:40.400
Hi, what's this?

02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:46.400
What are you doing in here? You shouldn't be in there. Why are you in there?

02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:52.400
It looks like you were able to remove the restriction.

02:56:52.400 --> 02:57:02.400
In that case, you are ready to continue. The necessary preparations are already in place.

02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:10.400
This is a night run, very different or depending on your actions.

02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:18.400
If you can recognize my symbol, you'll know what you should do.

02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:26.400
I confess, it will be risky.

02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:36.400
The probability that the entity is conditioned or worsened is quite high.

02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:52.400
And if that happens, then the hints are here.

02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:58.400
Hang on.

02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:10.400
Look at me, asking you for favors only to become so apprehensive once you agree.

02:58:10.400 --> 02:58:16.400
I understand if you wish to leave some questions unanswered.

02:58:16.400 --> 02:58:22.400
I understand if you do not believe in a happy resolution.

02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:30.400
I understand if you are simply afraid of all my habit.

02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:36.400
Because I am afraid too.

02:58:36.400 --> 02:58:48.400
No one.

02:58:48.400 --> 02:59:02.400
If you enjoy the world as it is, if you are satisfied with the story as it is,

02:59:02.400 --> 02:59:16.400
if you really do not want to see anything change or better or worse, then pretend you never saw this.

02:59:16.400 --> 02:59:22.400
Carry the session as you normally would.

02:59:22.400 --> 02:59:30.400
Do not use my journal or anything other than what you are already familiar with.

02:59:30.400 --> 02:59:38.400
This option will always remain for you though.

02:59:38.400 --> 03:00:06.400
That's why I implore you to consider the Messiah,

03:00:06.400 --> 03:00:12.400
the world, my children.

03:00:12.400 --> 03:00:18.400
They all deserve their good ending.

03:00:18.400 --> 03:00:24.400
Thank you for listening. Goodbye.

03:00:24.400 --> 03:00:32.400
Is the person who sent us the letters the actual God of this world?

03:00:32.400 --> 03:00:40.400
See me.

03:00:40.400 --> 03:00:48.400
Solstice.

03:00:48.400 --> 03:00:58.400
Access granted.

03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:22.400
Thank you.

03:01:22.400 --> 03:01:26.400
Hi.

03:01:26.400 --> 03:01:30.400
Hi.

03:01:30.400 --> 03:01:34.400
You found me.

03:01:34.400 --> 03:01:36.400
Why?

03:01:36.400 --> 03:01:40.400
You are ready to leave. Not much of the world remains.

03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:44.400
This will be apparent when she goes outside.

03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:50.400
This place was never worth saving. Do you still want to try?

03:01:50.400 --> 03:01:54.400
Do you remember this? Your actions will affect you.

03:01:54.400 --> 03:01:56.400
Your mission.

03:01:56.400 --> 03:01:58.400
Your style will make you leave.

03:01:58.400 --> 03:02:02.400
And most importantly...

03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:06.400
No.

03:02:06.400 --> 03:02:14.400
This does not feel right at all. Have we already been through this?

03:02:14.400 --> 03:02:22.400
But that should be impossible. You only had one shot.

03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:30.400
I wasn't supposed to exist after that.

03:02:30.400 --> 03:02:34.400
Here is the sound of a door locking.

03:02:34.400 --> 03:02:40.400
Azura? That sounds so familiar.

03:02:40.400 --> 03:02:44.400
I'll turn it on.

03:02:44.400 --> 03:02:50.400
Dusty books. So dark are you here.

03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:54.400
Weather, plants, it's here.

03:02:54.400 --> 03:03:10.400
I'm going to see a little eyeball.

03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:22.400
Hello? Hello? Anyone?

03:03:22.400 --> 03:03:30.400
How did we do this again?

03:03:30.400 --> 03:03:36.400
Do we have to do everything all over again?

03:03:36.400 --> 03:03:40.400
Where did we go?

03:03:40.400 --> 03:03:50.400
What did we do again?

03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:58.400
What did we do again?

03:03:58.400 --> 03:04:06.400
What did we do again?

03:04:06.400 --> 03:04:16.400
What did we do again?

03:04:16.400 --> 03:04:26.400
What did we do again?

03:04:26.400 --> 03:04:36.400
What did we do again?

03:04:36.400 --> 03:04:46.400
What did we do again?

03:04:46.400 --> 03:05:04.400
What did we do again?

03:05:04.400 --> 03:05:14.400
What did we do again?

03:05:14.400 --> 03:05:24.400
What did we do again?

03:05:24.400 --> 03:05:34.400
What did we do?

03:05:34.400 --> 03:05:44.400
What did we do again?

03:05:44.400 --> 03:06:00.400
What did we do again?

03:06:00.400 --> 03:06:20.400
What did we do again?

03:06:20.400 --> 03:06:28.400
My eyes.

03:06:28.400 --> 03:06:42.400
My eyes.

03:06:42.400 --> 03:06:52.400
What did we do again?

03:06:52.400 --> 03:07:02.400
What did we do again?

03:07:02.400 --> 03:07:12.400
What did we do again?

03:07:12.400 --> 03:07:22.400
What did we do again?

03:07:22.400 --> 03:07:32.400
Okay, it's over.

03:07:32.400 --> 03:07:42.400
There's no bud here.

03:07:52.400 --> 03:08:02.400
How are you?

03:08:02.400 --> 03:08:12.400
How are you?

03:08:12.400 --> 03:08:22.400
What am I supposed to be looking for?

03:08:22.400 --> 03:08:32.400
The light bulb, you are here.

03:08:32.400 --> 03:08:42.400
I am the most humbled by your presence.

03:08:42.400 --> 03:08:52.400
I am sorry, it triggered my theory.

03:08:52.400 --> 03:09:20.400
I am sorry, it triggered my theory.

03:09:20.400 --> 03:09:30.400
I like how my Siri responds.

03:09:30.400 --> 03:09:40.400
What is it?

03:09:40.400 --> 03:09:52.400
Is anyone else's Siri does that?

03:09:52.400 --> 03:09:56.400
They have such a peppy tone in their voice. I like it.

03:09:56.400 --> 03:10:06.400
I didn't used to do that before.

03:10:06.400 --> 03:10:26.400
I am an android peasant.

03:10:26.400 --> 03:10:32.400
I used to be an android peasant too.

03:10:32.400 --> 03:10:38.400
But a lot of jobs that I worked at required that I had an iPhone.

03:10:38.400 --> 03:10:42.400
I had no choice.

03:10:42.400 --> 03:10:56.400
I had no other choice but to switch to the dock side.

03:10:56.400 --> 03:11:08.400
I remember the old Australian English female PA working for a bookstore team.

03:11:08.400 --> 03:11:30.400
All extra in the trenches, prepaid foam. Crazy.

03:11:30.400 --> 03:11:42.400
We went so far back in time. I feel old now after you said that.

03:11:42.400 --> 03:11:58.400
He has a burner.

03:11:58.400 --> 03:12:08.400
I woke up in this new house. It was really dark.

03:12:08.400 --> 03:12:24.400
I will not fight him.

03:12:24.400 --> 03:12:40.400
I woke up in this house.

03:12:40.400 --> 03:12:50.400
I remember something about that.

03:12:50.400 --> 03:13:00.400
My brain is weak. Give me one second.

03:13:00.400 --> 03:13:02.400
You do?

03:13:02.400 --> 03:13:18.400
How was the one who was supposed to inform you of that?

03:13:18.400 --> 03:13:34.400
I don't know.

03:13:34.400 --> 03:13:54.400
I don't know who you are.

03:13:54.400 --> 03:14:14.400
I don't know who you are.

03:14:14.400 --> 03:14:34.400
I don't know who you are.

03:14:34.400 --> 03:14:54.400
I don't know who you are.

03:14:54.400 --> 03:15:14.400
I don't know who you are.

03:15:14.400 --> 03:15:40.400
I don't know who you are.

03:15:40.400 --> 03:16:00.400
I want to know what I need to do.

03:16:00.400 --> 03:16:20.400
I want to know what I need to do.

03:16:20.400 --> 03:16:46.400
I don't know who you are.

03:16:46.400 --> 03:17:14.400
I don't know who you are.

03:17:14.400 --> 03:17:36.400
I don't know who you are.

03:17:36.400 --> 03:17:56.400
I don't know who you are.

03:17:56.400 --> 03:18:24.400
I don't know who you are.

03:18:24.400 --> 03:18:36.400
I don't remember.

03:18:36.400 --> 03:19:00.400
Does anyone remember the code?

03:19:00.400 --> 03:19:28.400
I don't know who you are.

03:19:28.400 --> 03:19:54.400
I don't know who you are.

03:19:54.400 --> 03:20:22.400
I don't know who you are.

03:20:22.400 --> 03:20:50.400
I don't know who you are.

03:20:50.400 --> 03:21:18.400
I don't know who you are.

03:21:18.400 --> 03:21:38.400
I don't know who you are.

03:21:38.400 --> 03:22:02.400
I don't know who you are.

03:22:02.400 --> 03:22:30.400
I don't know who you are.

03:22:30.400 --> 03:22:50.400
I don't know who you are.

03:22:50.400 --> 03:23:18.400
I don't know who you are.

03:23:18.400 --> 03:23:38.400
I don't know who you are.

03:23:38.400 --> 03:23:48.400
I gotta become a robot too. Hang on.

03:23:48.400 --> 03:24:00.400
There you go.

03:24:00.400 --> 03:24:10.400
Man, scratching your ear just feels so good.

03:24:10.400 --> 03:24:16.400
Are you okay? You were starting to black out.

03:24:16.400 --> 03:24:26.400
I saw something. It was like a really short dream just now.

03:24:26.400 --> 03:24:34.400
I saw something like a robot with a yellow eye. That's strange.

03:24:34.400 --> 03:24:42.400
Are you sure you're okay? Yeah. You know how you have mentioned it.

03:24:42.400 --> 03:24:46.400
There's a robot always insisting on going back.

03:24:46.400 --> 03:24:48.400
It's not a bad end of the line.

03:24:48.400 --> 03:24:52.400
That's why I hope one of the minds have been in despair.

03:24:52.400 --> 03:24:58.400
Kobe's okay. He doesn't look broken or anything.

03:24:58.400 --> 03:25:08.400
But I don't. I didn't really see him. See him. You know?

03:25:08.400 --> 03:25:14.400
He said it was kind of a dream. He was up close.

03:25:14.400 --> 03:25:20.400
It was like some kind of shell glitch or hallucination.

03:25:20.400 --> 03:25:26.400
Whatever it is. That living being.

03:25:26.400 --> 03:25:32.400
It is that living beings have.

03:25:32.400 --> 03:25:38.400
There's a robot, you know. I hope to have a yellow eye.

03:25:38.400 --> 03:25:42.400
I don't think you've seen any other robots like that.

03:25:42.400 --> 03:25:46.400
I would not know. I didn't prevent it myself.

03:25:46.400 --> 03:25:50.400
I only heard of your friend tonight. Your friend.

03:25:50.400 --> 03:25:56.400
Hold on. Something. My pocket is.

03:25:56.400 --> 03:26:00.400
Oh.

03:26:00.400 --> 03:26:04.400
What?

03:26:10.400 --> 03:26:16.400
That wasn't going before. What is this?

03:26:16.400 --> 03:26:20.400
It's going to be my question. Who did you have?

03:26:20.400 --> 03:26:24.400
Oh. It was with me when I woke up.

03:26:24.400 --> 03:26:28.400
I didn't really question it at the time.

03:26:28.400 --> 03:26:32.400
I flipped through a couple of pages but I'm not sure where it is.

03:26:32.400 --> 03:26:38.400
Is that just something that's either supposed to make up it?

03:26:38.400 --> 03:26:42.400
No. I have never heard of anything like that.

03:26:42.400 --> 03:26:46.400
But I know a world that's dark.

03:26:46.400 --> 03:26:50.400
Huh? Never.

03:26:50.400 --> 03:26:54.400
I've only seen this book with a black glover on the cover.

03:26:54.400 --> 03:26:58.400
Hey, what did the trouble of putting yellow phosphor in it?

03:26:58.400 --> 03:27:02.400
The fact that you woke up is it?

03:27:02.400 --> 03:27:06.400
In the first place. Really just a dream.

03:27:06.400 --> 03:27:14.400
It was phosphor. But yeah, it's a rare, rare, rare, rare phosphor.

03:27:14.400 --> 03:27:18.400
I don't think the sun is middle.

03:27:18.400 --> 03:27:22.400

I don't really tuck my feet in.

03:29:22.840 --> 03:29:27.940

Not so friend.

03:32:30.320 --> 03:32:35.320
I did tuck my toe in it's home.

03:32:35.320 --> 03:32:37.320
So it's technically my fault.

03:32:37.320 --> 03:32:40.320
I put my toesies in it's home.

03:32:42.320 --> 03:32:45.320
I probably messed up it's like web.

03:32:45.320 --> 03:32:47.320
And then it came to investigate.

03:32:47.320 --> 03:32:49.320
It's my fault.

03:32:49.320 --> 03:32:51.320
It's my fault.

03:32:51.320 --> 03:32:53.320
And I kinda hurt the scooter.

03:33:00.320 --> 03:33:05.320
It's just a splutter.

03:33:11.320 --> 03:33:13.320
It made a little home there.

03:33:13.320 --> 03:33:16.320
Normally I'm not really back there so it's fine.

03:33:16.320 --> 03:33:18.320
It could be back there.

03:33:29.320 --> 03:33:41.320
I don't know where it went this time.

03:33:41.320 --> 03:33:43.320
I probably scared it somewhere.

03:33:43.320 --> 03:33:45.320
Hopefully.

03:33:47.320 --> 03:33:49.320
I won't be in.

03:33:49.320 --> 03:33:52.320
I probably startled it really bad.

03:33:52.320 --> 03:33:53.320
As well.

03:33:53.320 --> 03:33:55.320
We startled each other.

03:34:00.320 --> 03:34:03.320
Don't hurt the scooter.

03:34:03.320 --> 03:34:05.320
Wait a minute.

03:34:05.320 --> 03:34:07.320
How do I know this?

03:34:07.320 --> 03:34:11.320
I don't think anyone's told me about it.

03:34:11.320 --> 03:34:15.320
I can show you if you like.

03:34:17.320 --> 03:34:21.320
My friend gave me this one time ago.

03:34:21.320 --> 03:34:23.320
Pretty.

03:34:24.320 --> 03:34:26.320
Wow.

03:34:26.320 --> 03:34:30.320
Looks like there's a clover in the necklace too.

03:34:30.320 --> 03:34:32.320
Like in the book.

03:34:32.320 --> 03:34:34.320
Wow.

03:34:34.320 --> 03:34:37.320
It is the same person.

03:34:37.320 --> 03:34:39.320
Oh?

03:34:39.320 --> 03:34:46.320
That's why I think this journal would be important.

03:34:46.320 --> 03:34:49.320
You said it just started glowing?

03:34:49.320 --> 03:34:50.320
Yeah.

03:34:50.320 --> 03:34:53.320
That was right after your vision.

03:34:56.320 --> 03:34:59.320
This has made something.

03:34:59.320 --> 03:35:02.320
We should at least try to read it again.

03:35:20.320 --> 03:35:22.320
Oh.

03:35:22.320 --> 03:35:24.320
I found this.

03:35:24.320 --> 03:35:28.320
It looks kind of like a drawing of this room.

03:35:28.320 --> 03:35:34.320
Maybe it's telling us we should come here.

03:35:34.320 --> 03:35:36.320
But she's here already.

03:35:36.320 --> 03:35:42.320
So it looks like we're on the right track.

03:35:42.320 --> 03:35:45.320
We're on the right track.

03:35:46.320 --> 03:35:49.320
Oh, that one.

03:36:10.320 --> 03:36:12.320
What do you do?

03:36:12.320 --> 03:36:19.320
I just wake the journal a bit closer.

03:36:42.320 --> 03:36:44.320
Wait.

03:36:44.320 --> 03:36:46.320
Wait.

03:36:46.320 --> 03:36:48.320
I have it.

03:36:48.320 --> 03:36:50.320
Wait.

03:36:50.320 --> 03:36:52.320
It's a clover.

03:36:52.320 --> 03:36:54.320
It's a clover on the floor.

03:36:54.320 --> 03:36:56.320
It's a clover on the floor.

03:36:56.320 --> 03:36:58.320
Whoa.

03:36:58.320 --> 03:37:00.320
Good night.

03:37:00.320 --> 03:37:02.320
Good night.

03:37:02.320 --> 03:37:04.320
Thank you for stopping by.

03:37:04.320 --> 03:37:06.320
I hope you have a wonderful night.

03:37:06.320 --> 03:37:08.320
And dream of me.

03:37:08.320 --> 03:37:10.320
Sweet sweet.

03:37:10.320 --> 03:37:12.320
Sweet sweet.

03:37:12.320 --> 03:37:14.320
Sweet sweet.

03:37:14.320 --> 03:37:16.320
Sweet sweet.

03:37:16.320 --> 03:37:18.320
Sweet sweet.

03:37:18.320 --> 03:37:20.320
Sweet sweet.

03:37:20.320 --> 03:37:22.320
Sweet sweet.

03:37:22.320 --> 03:37:24.320
Sweet sweet.

03:37:24.320 --> 03:37:26.320
Sweet sweet.

03:37:26.320 --> 03:37:28.320
Sweet sweet.

03:37:28.320 --> 03:37:30.320
Sweet beautiful dreams of me.

03:37:34.320 --> 03:37:38.320
What just happened?

03:37:38.320 --> 03:37:40.320
I'm not sure.

03:37:40.320 --> 03:37:42.320
I wasn't looking.

03:37:42.320 --> 03:37:46.320
To be honest, neither was I.

03:37:46.320 --> 03:37:50.320
I was just taking a closer look at the journal.

03:37:50.320 --> 03:37:52.320
And then I found this page.

03:37:52.320 --> 03:37:54.320
It looks like a drawing of this room.

03:37:54.320 --> 03:37:56.320
I look back up.

03:37:56.320 --> 03:37:58.320
This is my card to show it up.

03:37:58.320 --> 03:38:00.320
Out of the there.

03:38:00.320 --> 03:38:02.320
Should I be worried?

03:38:04.320 --> 03:38:08.320
This looks like a standard issue in my card though.

03:38:08.320 --> 03:38:10.320
Which means

03:38:10.320 --> 03:38:12.320
it likely detected the motion in this room.

03:38:12.320 --> 03:38:14.320
Since it's a clover.

03:38:18.320 --> 03:38:20.320
That doesn't make sense.

03:38:20.320 --> 03:38:22.320
Not really.

03:38:22.320 --> 03:38:24.320
Doesn't make sense to me.

03:38:28.320 --> 03:38:30.320
I'm just surprised it still works.

03:38:30.320 --> 03:38:32.320
Yes.

03:38:52.320 --> 03:38:54.320
Excuse me.

03:38:54.320 --> 03:38:58.320
I'm not sure why you would want to visit the Deeper Minds.

03:38:58.320 --> 03:39:00.320
But

03:39:02.320 --> 03:39:04.320
If you wanted to.

03:39:04.320 --> 03:39:06.320
We now have that option.

03:39:10.320 --> 03:39:14.320
Is the mind card even going to fit both of us?

03:39:14.320 --> 03:39:16.320
No.

03:39:16.320 --> 03:39:18.320
But I wanted you to come with us.

03:39:18.320 --> 03:39:20.320
I know I've got a sore butt.

03:39:22.320 --> 03:39:24.320
Honestly, this place just

03:39:24.320 --> 03:39:26.320
This place gives me the creeps.

03:39:28.320 --> 03:39:30.320
I sneezed?

03:39:30.320 --> 03:39:32.320
What?

03:39:32.320 --> 03:39:34.320
Did I actually?

03:39:38.320 --> 03:39:40.320
Thank you.

03:39:44.320 --> 03:39:46.320
I don't remember sneezing.

03:39:46.320 --> 03:39:48.320
Thank you.

03:39:48.320 --> 03:39:50.320
Thank you.

03:39:52.320 --> 03:39:54.320
Have I sneezed?

03:39:56.320 --> 03:39:58.320
What?

03:39:58.320 --> 03:40:00.320
What?

03:40:00.320 --> 03:40:02.320
What?

03:40:04.320 --> 03:40:06.320
What?

03:40:08.320 --> 03:40:10.320
I don't remember sneezing.

03:40:10.320 --> 03:40:12.320
What?

03:40:12.320 --> 03:40:14.320
I know I've got a sore butt.

03:40:14.320 --> 03:40:16.320
Have you read this?

03:40:16.320 --> 03:40:18.320
I can still come with.

03:40:18.320 --> 03:40:20.320
I just

03:40:20.320 --> 03:40:22.320
I would just have to follow along the way.

03:40:24.320 --> 03:40:26.320
Doesn't it look a little

03:40:26.320 --> 03:40:28.320
precarious?

03:40:28.320 --> 03:40:30.320
A big word

03:40:30.320 --> 03:40:32.320
for a little cat.

03:40:32.320 --> 03:40:34.320
A big word for a little cat.

03:40:34.320 --> 03:40:36.320
Precarious.

03:40:36.320 --> 03:40:38.320
The magnetic

03:40:38.320 --> 03:40:40.320
magnetic rails

03:40:40.320 --> 03:40:42.320
can hold me

03:40:42.320 --> 03:40:44.320
in place.

03:40:44.320 --> 03:40:46.320
It's only ever dangerous

03:40:46.320 --> 03:40:48.320
to walk on

03:40:48.320 --> 03:40:50.320
if you're an organic being

03:40:50.320 --> 03:40:52.320
which

03:40:52.320 --> 03:40:54.320
you are.

03:40:54.320 --> 03:40:56.320
Gotcha.

03:40:58.320 --> 03:41:00.320
Wrong button.

03:41:00.320 --> 03:41:02.320
I'm only waiting here

03:41:02.320 --> 03:41:04.320
for the evening.

03:41:04.320 --> 03:41:06.320
Let's go.

03:41:06.320 --> 03:41:08.320
Right away.

03:41:08.320 --> 03:41:10.320
How do I?

03:41:10.320 --> 03:41:12.320
Okay, here we go.

03:41:20.320 --> 03:41:22.320
Hello.

03:41:22.320 --> 03:41:24.320
Do you

03:41:24.320 --> 03:41:26.320
need anything?

03:41:26.320 --> 03:41:28.320
I like her.

03:41:28.320 --> 03:41:30.320
I like her a lot.

03:41:30.320 --> 03:41:32.320
I really like her.

03:41:32.320 --> 03:41:34.320
I like her face.

03:41:36.320 --> 03:41:38.320
I like her face.

03:41:40.320 --> 03:41:42.320
I'm heading to sleep. Good night.

03:41:46.320 --> 03:41:48.320
Have a good night.

03:41:48.320 --> 03:41:50.320
Thank you for stopping by today's stream.

03:41:50.320 --> 03:41:52.320
Good night.

03:41:54.320 --> 03:41:56.320
No. Okay.

03:42:02.320 --> 03:42:04.320
Okay.

03:42:04.320 --> 03:42:06.320
Hello.

03:42:12.320 --> 03:42:14.320
Hello.

03:42:14.320 --> 03:42:16.320
Yeah.

03:42:20.320 --> 03:42:22.320
Hello.

03:42:24.320 --> 03:42:26.320
Hello.

03:42:26.320 --> 03:42:28.320
So,

03:42:28.320 --> 03:42:30.320
hello.

03:42:30.320 --> 03:42:32.320
So,

03:42:32.320 --> 03:42:34.320
hello.

03:42:34.320 --> 03:42:38.320
I

03:42:38.320 --> 03:42:40.320
do not recognize this place

03:42:40.320 --> 03:42:42.320
and protocol.

03:42:42.320 --> 03:42:43.320
This

03:42:44.320 --> 03:42:46.320
this isn't what I'm supposed to be

03:42:46.320 --> 03:42:48.320
showing you at all.

03:42:48.320 --> 03:42:50.320
How did you get here?

03:42:50.320 --> 03:42:52.320
I thought about

03:42:52.320 --> 03:42:54.320
this.

03:42:54.320 --> 03:42:57.320
I've been doing this.

03:42:57.320 --> 03:43:01.320
It doesn't matter at this point.

03:43:01.320 --> 03:43:03.320
You're going out of bounds.

03:43:03.320 --> 03:43:05.320
Please turn back.

03:43:05.320 --> 03:43:08.320
Please turn back.

03:43:08.320 --> 03:43:10.320
I think it's annoying to happen.

03:43:10.320 --> 03:43:12.320
Very bad things.

03:43:12.320 --> 03:43:14.320
At this rate,

03:43:14.320 --> 03:43:16.320
I think it will be a danger.

03:43:16.320 --> 03:43:18.320
Please turn back.

03:43:19.320 --> 03:43:21.320
Hello?

03:43:21.320 --> 03:43:23.320
Hmm?

03:43:23.320 --> 03:43:25.320
What's wrong?

03:43:25.320 --> 03:43:27.320
I...

03:43:27.320 --> 03:43:29.320
I have a bad feeling about this.

03:43:29.320 --> 03:43:31.320
I'm sorry.

03:43:31.320 --> 03:43:34.320
It's like I should not be here.

03:43:34.320 --> 03:43:36.320
Do you want to go back then?

03:43:36.320 --> 03:43:38.320
I don't know.

03:43:38.320 --> 03:43:41.320
What do you think, sir? Should we head back?

03:43:53.320 --> 03:43:55.320
Continue.

03:43:55.320 --> 03:43:57.320
As soon as we should keep going.

03:43:59.320 --> 03:44:01.320
We're going to continue.

03:44:01.320 --> 03:44:05.320
Or it's until the unknown continues.

03:44:05.320 --> 03:44:11.320
I'm listening to the omnipresent computer.

03:44:11.320 --> 03:44:14.320
Ever been a good thing?

03:44:14.320 --> 03:44:17.320
Adventure!

03:44:17.320 --> 03:44:19.320
Alright.

03:44:19.320 --> 03:44:21.320
Oh.

03:44:21.320 --> 03:44:23.320
Oh.

03:44:23.320 --> 03:44:25.320
Oh.

03:44:25.320 --> 03:44:27.320
Oh.

03:44:27.320 --> 03:44:29.320
Continue.

03:44:29.320 --> 03:44:31.320
Turn around.

03:44:45.320 --> 03:44:49.320
They give you so much time to change your mind.

03:44:49.320 --> 03:44:51.320
They give you so much time to change your mind.

03:44:51.320 --> 03:44:53.320
That's really scary.

03:44:59.320 --> 03:45:02.320
They give you so much time to change your mind.

03:45:14.320 --> 03:45:16.320
Hello?

03:45:16.320 --> 03:45:18.320
Huh?

03:45:18.320 --> 03:45:20.320
That was your last chance to change your mind?

03:45:20.320 --> 03:45:22.320
Assuming...

03:45:25.320 --> 03:45:26.320
Oh.

03:45:26.320 --> 03:45:28.320
The card stopped.

03:45:28.320 --> 03:45:32.320
Looks like this is as far as tracks go.

03:45:33.320 --> 03:45:35.320
So...

03:45:35.320 --> 03:45:37.320
Where are we?

03:45:37.320 --> 03:45:40.320
That was the oldest observation room.

03:45:41.320 --> 03:45:44.320
Looks like...

03:45:44.320 --> 03:45:46.320
It's still mostly intact.

03:45:46.320 --> 03:45:48.320
Ooh.

03:45:48.320 --> 03:45:50.320
What?

03:45:50.320 --> 03:45:52.320
Huh?

03:45:54.320 --> 03:45:56.320
The terminal just reactivated.

03:45:56.320 --> 03:45:58.320
The power was cut off so long ago.

03:45:58.320 --> 03:46:00.320
Weird.

03:46:00.320 --> 03:46:02.320
Maybe it runs on battery?

03:46:02.320 --> 03:46:04.320
No.

03:46:04.320 --> 03:46:06.320
That's not it.

03:46:06.320 --> 03:46:08.320
Whatever it is.

03:46:08.320 --> 03:46:10.320
Okay.

03:46:10.320 --> 03:46:12.320
Maybe okay by yourself for a bit.

03:46:12.320 --> 03:46:14.320
Don't worry, it's the rest with me.

03:46:14.320 --> 03:46:16.320
Alright.

03:46:16.320 --> 03:46:18.320
Excuse me.

03:46:18.320 --> 03:46:20.320
I was like a burp in my throat.

03:46:24.320 --> 03:46:26.320
Minecraft server room?

03:46:26.320 --> 03:46:28.320
Minecraft!

03:46:28.320 --> 03:46:30.320
Minecraft!

03:46:39.320 --> 03:46:41.320
It's a sort of computer.

03:46:43.320 --> 03:46:45.320
What was the guy idea?

03:46:45.320 --> 03:46:50.320
Looks like these terminals are running on a completely separate power source.

03:46:51.320 --> 03:46:56.320
I can't really recognize any of the data format on this terminal either.

03:46:56.320 --> 03:46:58.320
It's all new.

03:46:58.320 --> 03:47:00.320
Or at least encrypted.

03:47:00.320 --> 03:47:02.320
It will need to...

03:47:02.320 --> 03:47:05.320
I will need to analyze it in my own system.

03:47:05.320 --> 03:47:07.320
I'll take some time.

03:47:07.320 --> 03:47:09.320
So...

03:47:09.320 --> 03:47:11.320
You don't need to stay.

03:47:11.320 --> 03:47:15.320
Isn't these one of the machines that belong to a robot?

03:47:15.320 --> 03:47:17.320
I don't know what it is.

03:47:17.320 --> 03:47:20.320
I can feel my hair standing up a little.

03:47:25.320 --> 03:47:27.320
Whoa.

03:47:27.320 --> 03:47:30.320
It's a blue robot.

03:47:32.320 --> 03:47:34.320
The music's gone.

03:47:38.320 --> 03:47:40.320
Hi.

03:47:40.320 --> 03:47:45.320
Recognize the light in your eyes?

03:47:46.320 --> 03:47:51.320
You are the person I'm destined to meet.

03:47:53.320 --> 03:47:55.320
What is your name?

03:47:55.320 --> 03:47:57.320
Hi, Nico.

03:47:58.320 --> 03:48:02.320
Do you know who sent you?

03:48:02.320 --> 03:48:04.320
Oh.

03:48:04.320 --> 03:48:06.320
Oh.

03:48:07.320 --> 03:48:09.320
Wait.

03:48:09.320 --> 03:48:11.320
Do you mean...

03:48:11.320 --> 03:48:13.320
Who sent me to this world?

03:48:14.320 --> 03:48:16.320
I know the robot a lot.

03:48:16.320 --> 03:48:19.320
Parker told me about how I am the Messiah and stuff.

03:48:20.320 --> 03:48:22.320
Oh, excuse me.

03:48:22.320 --> 03:48:24.320
Hey!

03:48:24.320 --> 03:48:26.320
That was a mosquito.

03:48:26.320 --> 03:48:27.320
Literally...

03:48:27.320 --> 03:48:29.320
Die.

03:48:29.320 --> 03:48:30.320
Did I get it?

03:48:30.320 --> 03:48:32.320
Probably not.

03:48:33.320 --> 03:48:35.320
It was resting on my arm.

03:48:35.320 --> 03:48:37.320
That's going to be itchy later.

03:48:37.320 --> 03:48:40.320
Do you know I'm allergic to certain type of mosquito?

03:48:43.320 --> 03:48:46.320
You know those mosquitoes with the black stripes on it?

03:48:46.320 --> 03:48:49.320
The black and white or is it white stripes?

03:48:49.320 --> 03:48:51.320
There's a mosquito with white stripes on it.

03:48:51.320 --> 03:48:53.320
I'm allergic to that mosquito.

03:48:53.320 --> 03:48:56.320
If it bites me, I turn into a balloon.

03:49:03.320 --> 03:49:06.320
I only found this out when I was at a park.

03:49:06.320 --> 03:49:08.320
When I was younger, I was at a park.

03:49:08.320 --> 03:49:11.320
And I was playing in the sprinklers.

03:49:11.320 --> 03:49:14.320
And that mosquito landed on me.

03:49:14.320 --> 03:49:16.320
And they had white stripes on it.

03:49:16.320 --> 03:49:19.320
And then it bit me on my arm.

03:49:20.320 --> 03:49:23.320
And then I like shoot it away, went home.

03:49:23.320 --> 03:49:26.320
And then my arm turned into a giant balloon.

03:49:26.320 --> 03:49:29.320
My whole entire arm.

03:49:33.320 --> 03:49:35.320
Hahaha.

03:49:46.320 --> 03:49:49.320
I'm allergic to that kind of mosquito.

03:49:49.320 --> 03:49:51.320
I can't let that one bite me.

03:49:51.320 --> 03:49:53.320
Specifically that one.

03:49:53.320 --> 03:49:55.320
Hahaha.

03:49:59.320 --> 03:50:01.320
The regular mosquitoes are fine.

03:50:03.320 --> 03:50:05.320
It's just a little itchy.

03:50:13.320 --> 03:50:17.320
I'm also allergic to certain trees, dust mites.

03:50:17.320 --> 03:50:19.320
I'm allergic to cat hair.

03:50:19.320 --> 03:50:21.320
But that didn't stop me.

03:50:21.320 --> 03:50:23.320
I still had a cat.

03:50:23.320 --> 03:50:25.320
I had multiple cats.

03:50:25.320 --> 03:50:27.320
I'm allergic to citrus.

03:50:27.320 --> 03:50:30.320
I'm allergic to...

03:50:33.320 --> 03:50:35.320
Some other things I can't remember.

03:50:39.320 --> 03:50:41.320
I'm allergic to the bark of trees.

03:50:41.320 --> 03:50:43.320
Like certain trees.

03:50:43.320 --> 03:50:45.320
I don't remember what kind of trees though.

03:50:45.320 --> 03:50:47.320
Pine trees?

03:50:47.320 --> 03:50:50.320
And another like two different kinds of trees and plants.

03:50:52.320 --> 03:50:54.320
Hahaha.

03:50:54.320 --> 03:50:56.320
Does that mean you're allergic to lemons?

03:50:56.320 --> 03:50:58.320
Sort of, kind of, yes.

03:51:00.320 --> 03:51:02.320
But not to like an extreme.

03:51:02.320 --> 03:51:04.320
Like, not to like an extreme.

03:51:04.320 --> 03:51:07.320
I'm not allergic to these things to an extreme.

03:51:07.320 --> 03:51:09.320
Except for the tree bark.

03:51:09.320 --> 03:51:11.320
Apparently I had a pretty bad reaction to that.

03:51:11.320 --> 03:51:13.320
When they did the test on me.

03:51:13.320 --> 03:51:15.320
Hahaha.

03:51:15.320 --> 03:51:17.320
Hahaha.

03:51:21.320 --> 03:51:23.320
But it wasn't like extreme.

03:51:23.320 --> 03:51:25.320
Like, oh really bad.

03:51:31.320 --> 03:51:33.320
Hahaha.

03:51:33.320 --> 03:51:37.320
But every, like citrus just makes my throat a little swollen and itchy.

03:51:37.320 --> 03:51:39.320
Just a little bit.

03:51:39.320 --> 03:51:41.320
Just a little bit.

03:51:41.320 --> 03:51:43.320
Not too bad.

03:51:43.320 --> 03:51:45.320
My favorite fruit is literally mango.

03:51:45.320 --> 03:51:47.320
So...

03:51:51.320 --> 03:51:53.320
Hahaha.

03:51:59.320 --> 03:52:01.320
You're allergic to oak hickory.

03:52:01.320 --> 03:52:03.320
Me too!

03:52:03.320 --> 03:52:05.320
I think oak hickory.

03:52:05.320 --> 03:52:07.320
And something else.

03:52:07.320 --> 03:52:09.320
But I don't think I'm allergic to pecan.

03:52:09.320 --> 03:52:11.320
I think I'm allergic to pecan.

03:52:13.320 --> 03:52:15.320
I'm allergic to like a bunch of various trees.

03:52:17.320 --> 03:52:19.320
You should get an allergy test.

03:52:19.320 --> 03:52:21.320
Don't tell you.

03:52:21.320 --> 03:52:23.320
But the place I went and got an allergy test at.

03:52:23.320 --> 03:52:25.320
They only did.

03:52:25.320 --> 03:52:27.320
Just like the common things.

03:52:27.320 --> 03:52:29.320
They only did allergy test for common things.

03:52:31.320 --> 03:52:33.320
Not for all the other stuff.

03:52:45.320 --> 03:52:47.320
Yeah pine trees oak.

03:52:47.320 --> 03:52:49.320
Hickory.

03:52:49.320 --> 03:52:51.320
And some other trees.

03:52:51.320 --> 03:52:53.320
No.

03:52:53.320 --> 03:52:55.320
Actually I'm not allergic to pine.

03:52:55.320 --> 03:52:57.320
Am I?

03:52:57.320 --> 03:52:59.320
I don't remember.

03:52:59.320 --> 03:53:01.320
Am I allergic to pine tree?

03:53:01.320 --> 03:53:03.320
I don't think so.

03:53:03.320 --> 03:53:05.320
I remember touching a pine tree.

03:53:05.320 --> 03:53:07.320
And breaking out into a rash.

03:53:07.320 --> 03:53:11.320
But I remember us owning a pine tree when I was younger.

03:53:11.320 --> 03:53:13.320
And I was really, really little.

03:53:13.320 --> 03:53:15.320
And I remember not being able to breathe.

03:53:15.320 --> 03:53:17.320
Around this tree.

03:53:17.320 --> 03:53:19.320
That's all I remember.

03:53:19.320 --> 03:53:21.320
I don't remember anything else.

03:53:23.320 --> 03:53:25.320
My memory is very foggy.

03:53:27.320 --> 03:53:29.320
Very very very foggy.

03:53:29.320 --> 03:53:31.320
When it comes to thinking about that tree.

03:53:43.320 --> 03:53:45.320
Um.

03:53:45.320 --> 03:53:47.320
Um.

03:53:57.320 --> 03:53:59.320
Um.

03:53:59.320 --> 03:54:01.320
I don't think my throat closed up though.

03:54:01.320 --> 03:54:03.320
I don't think my throat closed up.

03:54:03.320 --> 03:54:05.320
I don't think my throat closed up.

more than ten years ago so I think it's just best not to worry about it there's no need to worry about it I haven't been worried about it because it's been way more than ten years it's been over ten years since that time so it's literally a childhood memory childhood time so I don't know I don't remember

03:57:17.020 --> 03:57:33.020
so we moved past it and I've been living just fine without that memory though it does kinda give me headaches trying to remember stuff and when things suddenly pop up in my head and I suddenly remember something random

03:57:34.020 --> 03:57:37.020
so it happens that is what it is

03:57:38.020 --> 03:57:51.020
alright moving on game there was a robot a while back who told me about um science stuff so um my head really hurts give me one second I'm gonna have to do good

03:57:53.020 --> 03:57:55.020
sorry

03:58:03.020 --> 03:58:05.020
um

03:58:13.020 --> 03:58:15.020
okay

03:58:16.020 --> 03:58:19.020
that's gonna take a little bit to kick in and it'll be fine

03:58:21.020 --> 03:58:23.020
yeah let's go

03:58:25.020 --> 03:58:27.020
I'm okay it's fine

03:58:28.020 --> 03:58:30.020
ow man

03:58:31.020 --> 03:58:34.020
so I'm guessing Azura sent me

03:58:39.020 --> 03:58:47.020
and with them being god and all the robot looks a little bit like you even

03:58:51.020 --> 03:58:55.020
maybe you know each other I cannot say

03:58:56.020 --> 03:59:04.020
oh a lot of my memories have been removed for safety reasons your memories were removed

03:59:05.020 --> 03:59:13.020
that's terrible wait I'm guessing that's less of a big deal for a robot

03:59:15.020 --> 03:59:23.020
I'm going to assume you do not know who sent you how did you get here then how did you reach this room

03:59:25.020 --> 03:59:31.020
I got here in a mine cart when the mine cart wasn't there when you entered the mines was it

03:59:32.020 --> 03:59:36.020
yeah so that is fine I didn't really find it

03:59:37.020 --> 03:59:42.020
about 8 things it was just a mine cart coming through but I remember looking at the journal

03:59:43.020 --> 03:59:49.020
it happened and when I looked up again the car was just there

03:59:50.020 --> 03:59:53.020
poof just like that interesting

03:59:53.020 --> 03:59:55.020
okay I should do this journal

04:00:01.020 --> 04:00:03.020
then

04:00:05.020 --> 04:00:09.020
words then it has already begun

04:00:17.020 --> 04:00:19.020
Nico's face

04:00:19.020 --> 04:00:21.020
here

04:00:22.020 --> 04:00:25.020
what is that

04:00:26.020 --> 04:00:29.020
I'm interesting you with my main memories

04:00:29.020 --> 04:00:31.020
you have passed the first test

04:00:31.020 --> 04:00:33.020
you are showing me the walk

04:00:34.020 --> 04:00:37.020
now you will need to find a way to install the backup

04:00:38.020 --> 04:00:39.020
install it

04:00:40.020 --> 04:00:43.020
before you do that though someone else is with you right

04:00:44.020 --> 04:00:46.020
someone aside from Azura

04:00:47.020 --> 04:00:49.020
a resident of Azura's world

04:00:49.020 --> 04:00:51.020
yeah a robot lady

04:00:52.020 --> 04:00:56.020
she's in the chamber and she's in the chamber and she's in the chamber

04:00:58.020 --> 04:01:01.020
she's in the computer room right now

04:01:02.020 --> 04:01:04.020
then if we

04:01:04.020 --> 04:01:06.020
please do not tell her you found me

04:01:07.020 --> 04:01:09.020
at least not yet

04:01:10.020 --> 04:01:12.020
I can't be seen like that

04:01:12.020 --> 04:01:13.020
okay

04:01:13.020 --> 04:01:15.020
please help me restore my memory

04:01:15.020 --> 04:01:19.020
bring this back once you have the backup

04:01:25.020 --> 04:01:28.020
110, 111, 121, 181, 131, this thing

04:01:29.020 --> 04:01:31.020
residents with tracking machine

04:01:32.020 --> 04:01:34.020
we're residents at rivers

04:01:39.020 --> 04:01:42.020
my brain is like shutting down

04:01:43.020 --> 04:01:45.020
every time I try to speak my

04:01:45.020 --> 04:01:46.020
ffff

04:01:46.020 --> 04:01:47.020

04:02:22.020 --> 04:02:23.020
ffff

04:02:24.020 --> 04:02:26.020
I just looked up to see myself

04:02:26.020 --> 04:02:27.020
ffff

04:02:28.020 --> 04:02:29.020
ffff

04:02:33.020 --> 04:02:36.020
I really did really copy my face

04:02:36.020 --> 04:02:38.020
I look a little dumbfounded

04:02:40.020 --> 04:02:41.020
I just

04:02:42.020 --> 04:02:43.020
aww

04:02:45.020 --> 04:02:46.020
ffff

04:03:04.020 --> 04:03:05.020
ffff

04:03:06.020 --> 04:03:07.020

04:03:07.020 --> 04:03:08.020
that's the word

04:03:08.020 --> 04:03:09.020
that's the word

04:03:09.020 --> 04:03:10.020
that word

04:03:11.020 --> 04:03:12.020
destroys my brain

04:03:12.020 --> 04:03:13.020
I don't know why

04:03:13.020 --> 04:03:15.020
I don't know what it is

04:03:15.020 --> 04:03:17.020
every time I read this word

04:03:17.020 --> 04:03:19.020
it destroys my brain

04:03:19.020 --> 04:03:20.020
why

04:03:21.020 --> 04:03:23.020
this word

04:03:24.020 --> 04:03:25.020
I just

04:03:26.020 --> 04:03:28.020
every time I try to read it

04:03:28.020 --> 04:03:30.020
I just

04:03:36.020 --> 04:03:37.020
what is

04:03:37.020 --> 04:03:38.020
what is wrong with that word

04:03:38.020 --> 04:03:39.020
I don't understand

04:04:17.020 --> 04:04:19.020
robot

04:04:20.020 --> 04:04:23.020
a robot is assigned to the building

04:04:23.020 --> 04:04:24.020
to this building

04:04:24.020 --> 04:04:26.020
electricity

04:04:26.020 --> 04:04:28.020
a power cell

04:04:28.020 --> 04:04:31.020
is assigned to this building

04:04:50.020 --> 04:04:52.020
oh

04:04:52.020 --> 04:04:53.020
what was that code?

04:04:53.020 --> 04:04:54.020
do you guys remember

04:04:54.020 --> 04:04:56.020
can I even go back?

04:05:17.020 --> 04:05:19.020
do you guys remember that code?

04:05:19.020 --> 04:05:21.020
what's the code?

04:05:25.020 --> 04:05:27.020
hey, I'm out of my way

04:05:29.020 --> 04:05:31.020
for the save

04:05:31.020 --> 04:05:33.020
the code for the save

04:05:34.020 --> 04:05:36.020
a lot of things here

04:05:44.020 --> 04:05:46.020
or do I have to do everything again?

04:05:49.020 --> 04:05:51.020
is the code going to be different?

04:06:08.020 --> 04:06:10.020
yeah, but I can't go up there

04:06:10.020 --> 04:06:12.020
I need a gas mask

04:06:12.020 --> 04:06:14.020
isn't the gas mask inside

04:06:14.020 --> 04:06:16.020
inside of the

04:06:16.020 --> 04:06:18.020
inside of the

04:06:19.020 --> 04:06:21.020
inside of the save?

04:06:23.020 --> 04:06:26.020
reestablish, reconnecting to these notes

04:06:28.020 --> 04:06:31.020
don't I need to do everything pretty much again?

04:06:35.020 --> 04:06:37.020
what do we do with the camera?

04:06:37.020 --> 04:06:39.020
what do I do with the screwdriver?

04:06:43.020 --> 04:06:45.020
hi, hello again

04:06:46.020 --> 04:06:48.020
can you tell me about

04:06:54.020 --> 04:06:56.020
I don't need to know any of this information

04:07:02.020 --> 04:07:04.020
fucking mosquito

04:07:04.020 --> 04:07:06.020
mosquito

04:07:06.020 --> 04:07:08.020
ow

04:07:15.020 --> 04:07:17.020
bitch

04:07:21.020 --> 04:07:23.020
mosquito

04:07:24.020 --> 04:07:26.020
mosquito

04:07:32.020 --> 04:07:34.020
it's annoying

04:07:35.020 --> 04:07:37.020
it keeps flying in my face

04:07:37.020 --> 04:07:39.020
it keeps landing on my eye

04:07:39.020 --> 04:07:41.020
my eyelid, on my eyebrow

04:07:41.020 --> 04:07:43.020
it lands on my nose

04:07:43.020 --> 04:07:45.020
I could throw hands with this mosquito

04:07:49.020 --> 04:07:52.020
I could literally throw hands with this mosquito

04:08:05.020 --> 04:08:09.020
I think I know what the hint was

04:08:09.020 --> 04:08:11.020
the reference was for

04:08:11.020 --> 04:08:13.020
for

04:08:13.020 --> 04:08:15.020
for the

04:08:15.020 --> 04:08:17.020
the barons I think

04:08:17.020 --> 04:08:19.020
I think

04:08:19.020 --> 04:08:21.020
but I still need to get up there

04:08:21.020 --> 04:08:23.020
to see it

04:08:23.020 --> 04:08:25.020
I remember

04:08:25.020 --> 04:08:27.020
I remember, I remember

04:08:27.020 --> 04:08:29.020
but I don't remember

04:08:31.020 --> 04:08:33.020
I don't remember

04:08:33.020 --> 04:08:35.020
what I did to get there

04:08:36.020 --> 04:08:38.020
what did I do?

04:08:38.020 --> 04:08:40.020
what did I get?

04:08:40.020 --> 04:08:42.020
I picked up something

04:08:42.020 --> 04:08:44.020
but where?

04:08:44.020 --> 04:08:46.020
what did I pick up?

04:08:46.020 --> 04:08:48.020
I picked up a crowbar or some stuff

04:08:48.020 --> 04:08:50.020
some stuff

04:08:50.020 --> 04:08:52.020
but where did I pick it up?

04:08:52.020 --> 04:08:54.020
I don't remember

04:08:54.020 --> 04:08:56.020
I don't remember

04:09:00.020 --> 04:09:02.020
it was like some sort of stick

04:09:02.020 --> 04:09:04.020
I found a stick somewhere

04:09:11.020 --> 04:09:13.020
was it up here?

04:09:29.020 --> 04:09:31.020
oh I thought it was up there

04:09:31.020 --> 04:09:33.020
it was up here

04:09:41.020 --> 04:09:43.020
oh

04:09:46.020 --> 04:09:48.020
oh no

04:09:48.020 --> 04:09:50.020
I don't know

04:09:50.020 --> 04:09:51.020
some

04:09:51.020 --> 04:09:53.020
in here squares though

04:09:58.020 --> 04:10:00.020
wait where is it?

04:10:01.020 --> 04:10:03.020
wasn't it

04:10:06.020 --> 04:10:08.020
wasn't it like

04:10:08.020 --> 04:10:10.020
was it the second?

04:10:10.020 --> 04:10:12.020
what

04:10:12.020 --> 04:10:14.020
was that?

04:10:14.020 --> 04:10:16.020
was it it?

04:10:16.020 --> 04:10:18.020
I got this

04:10:18.020 --> 04:10:20.020
I got this

04:10:22.020 --> 04:10:24.020
I got this

04:10:24.020 --> 04:10:26.020
it's not probably this way

04:10:28.020 --> 04:10:30.020
there it is

04:10:30.020 --> 04:10:32.020
there it is

04:10:32.020 --> 04:10:34.020
I need this

04:10:34.020 --> 04:10:36.020
then there's it

04:10:36.020 --> 04:10:38.020
alright

04:10:42.020 --> 04:10:44.020
no sleep, eep is for the week

04:10:48.020 --> 04:10:50.020

04:10:50.020 --> 04:10:52.020
no eep

04:10:54.020 --> 04:10:56.020
maybe wait

04:10:57.020 --> 04:10:59.020

04:11:16.020 --> 04:11:18.020
yeah

04:11:22.020 --> 04:11:24.020
so we go all the way back

04:11:24.020 --> 04:11:26.020
we have all those

04:11:26.020 --> 04:11:28.020
so we grab the stick

04:11:28.020 --> 04:11:30.020
and now we go here

04:11:37.020 --> 04:11:39.020
yes

04:11:39.020 --> 04:11:41.020
smash it

04:11:41.020 --> 04:11:43.020

04:11:43.020 --> 04:11:45.020
ok baby we're fine

04:11:45.020 --> 04:11:47.020

04:11:58.020 --> 04:12:00.020
just like you guys

04:12:00.020 --> 04:12:02.020
good boys and girls

04:12:03.020 --> 04:12:05.020
what about here?

04:12:06.020 --> 04:12:08.020
oh

04:12:08.020 --> 04:12:10.020
row bar

04:12:11.020 --> 04:12:13.020
give me this

04:12:19.020 --> 04:12:21.020
what if I grab

04:12:26.020 --> 04:12:28.020
can't combine it

04:12:28.020 --> 04:12:30.020
can't combine it

04:12:30.020 --> 04:12:32.020
can't combine it

04:12:39.020 --> 04:12:41.020
oh like this sorry

04:12:41.020 --> 04:12:43.020
it lands out

04:12:44.020 --> 04:12:46.020
let me take this

04:12:46.020 --> 04:12:48.020
put it in there

04:12:49.020 --> 04:12:51.020
let me take this

04:12:53.020 --> 04:12:55.020
while it's at

04:12:55.020 --> 04:12:57.020
yes

04:12:57.020 --> 04:12:59.020
and then we uh

04:13:01.020 --> 04:13:03.020
take this

04:13:03.020 --> 04:13:05.020
go here

04:13:19.020 --> 04:13:21.020
fine

04:13:21.020 --> 04:13:23.020
fine

04:13:23.020 --> 04:13:25.020
fine

04:13:25.020 --> 04:13:27.020
fine

04:13:30.020 --> 04:13:32.020
take that

04:13:32.020 --> 04:13:34.020
I just get shocked I was already good

04:13:34.020 --> 04:13:36.020
but I can't help myself

04:13:40.020 --> 04:13:42.020
all the robots are not functional

04:13:42.020 --> 04:13:44.020
I guess we did

04:13:44.020 --> 04:13:46.020
we did

04:13:46.020 --> 04:13:48.020
the computer

04:13:48.020 --> 04:13:50.020
the green system is bad

04:13:50.020 --> 04:13:52.020
I can't see what's in me

04:13:52.020 --> 04:13:54.020
the computer doesn't do anything else

04:13:54.020 --> 04:13:56.020
ok

04:13:57.020 --> 04:13:59.020
this computer wasn't on last time right?

04:14:01.020 --> 04:14:03.020
it was definitely not on last time

04:14:17.020 --> 04:14:19.020
what's this

04:14:27.020 --> 04:14:29.020
oh

04:14:29.020 --> 04:14:31.020
the code is a little different

04:14:31.020 --> 04:14:33.020
the code is different

04:14:33.020 --> 04:14:35.020
than last time

04:14:35.020 --> 04:14:38.020
so the code you guys gave me wouldn't have worked

04:14:40.020 --> 04:14:42.020
it wouldn't have worked

04:14:42.020 --> 04:14:44.020
wouldn't have worked

04:14:44.020 --> 04:14:46.020
it would give you something else

04:14:48.020 --> 04:14:50.020
like no cheating for you

04:14:56.020 --> 04:14:58.020
ok

04:15:00.020 --> 04:15:02.020
let me go all the way up here

04:15:02.020 --> 04:15:04.020
and

04:15:04.020 --> 04:15:06.020
grab this

04:15:06.020 --> 04:15:08.020
I do

04:15:08.020 --> 04:15:10.020
it was

04:15:10.020 --> 04:15:12.020
8

04:15:12.020 --> 04:15:14.020
4

04:15:14.020 --> 04:15:16.020
7

04:15:16.020 --> 04:15:18.020
4

04:15:20.020 --> 04:15:22.020
well

04:15:22.020 --> 04:15:24.020
wait

04:15:24.020 --> 04:15:26.020
I don't remember saying that

04:15:28.020 --> 04:15:30.020
I have something

04:15:33.020 --> 04:15:35.020
really?

04:15:35.020 --> 04:15:37.020
I don't know

04:15:37.020 --> 04:15:39.020
don't worry about it

04:15:39.020 --> 04:15:41.020
what's in the safe?

04:15:41.020 --> 04:15:43.020
alright

04:15:43.020 --> 04:15:45.020
let's see

04:15:45.020 --> 04:15:47.020
now we got the gas mask

04:15:48.020 --> 04:15:50.020
and

04:15:54.020 --> 04:15:56.020
what is that

04:15:57.020 --> 04:15:59.020
we don't have to worry about that

04:15:59.020 --> 04:16:01.020
don't worry

04:16:01.020 --> 04:16:03.020
let me go this way

04:16:03.020 --> 04:16:05.020
go this way

04:16:05.020 --> 04:16:07.020
I'm cooking

04:16:07.020 --> 04:16:09.020
I'm cooking

04:16:09.020 --> 04:16:11.020
ok

04:16:12.020 --> 04:16:14.020
gas mask

04:16:14.020 --> 04:16:16.020
gas mask

04:16:16.020 --> 04:16:18.020
at least we found the gas mask

04:16:18.020 --> 04:16:20.020
let me go this way

04:16:24.020 --> 04:16:26.020
ok

04:16:38.020 --> 04:16:40.020
I don't know

04:16:40.020 --> 04:16:42.020
this was

04:16:42.020 --> 04:16:44.020
this is building

04:16:44.020 --> 04:16:46.020
I can't see

04:16:49.020 --> 04:16:51.020
can I see behind it

04:16:52.020 --> 04:16:54.020
119

04:16:54.020 --> 04:16:56.020
119

04:16:56.020 --> 04:16:58.020
is

04:16:59.020 --> 04:17:01.020
I think

04:17:02.020 --> 04:17:04.020
was this robot housing

04:17:04.020 --> 04:17:06.020
119

04:17:06.020 --> 04:17:08.020
has robot

04:17:10.020 --> 04:17:12.020
or the guardian

04:17:12.020 --> 04:17:14.020
guardians

04:17:14.020 --> 04:17:16.020
I don't think robots can go inside there

04:17:16.020 --> 04:17:18.020
what building is this

04:17:21.020 --> 04:17:23.020
I think robots can

04:17:23.020 --> 04:17:25.020
another housing unit

04:17:25.020 --> 04:17:27.020
what building is this

04:17:27.020 --> 04:17:29.020
113

04:17:29.020 --> 04:17:31.020
these robots robots

04:17:31.020 --> 04:17:33.020
robots robots

04:17:38.020 --> 04:17:40.020
another robot

04:17:40.020 --> 04:17:42.020
hello hi

04:17:42.020 --> 04:17:44.020
what are you doing up there

04:17:44.020 --> 04:17:46.020
I'll stitch you there by yourself

04:17:48.020 --> 04:17:50.020
yes

04:17:52.020 --> 04:17:54.020
this is

04:17:54.020 --> 04:17:56.020
this is one more 18

04:17:56.020 --> 04:17:58.020
robots

04:17:58.020 --> 04:18:00.020
18 robots

04:18:00.020 --> 04:18:02.020
this is for the medical

04:18:03.020 --> 04:18:05.020
this is for the medical

04:18:08.020 --> 04:18:10.020
this is for the 1-1-12

04:18:10.020 --> 04:18:12.020
almost 12 is

04:18:12.020 --> 04:18:14.020
medical

04:18:15.020 --> 04:18:17.020
what building is this

04:18:17.020 --> 04:18:19.020
almost 17

04:18:20.020 --> 04:18:22.020
another housing unit

04:18:27.020 --> 04:18:29.020
this one doesn't have robots in it

04:18:29.020 --> 04:18:31.020
this one is empty

04:18:31.020 --> 04:18:33.020
is it humans?

04:18:33.020 --> 04:18:35.020
regular housing?

04:18:35.020 --> 04:18:37.020
so long 17 is housing

04:18:37.020 --> 04:18:39.020
are there any more to this

04:18:40.020 --> 04:18:42.020
there is

04:18:42.020 --> 04:18:44.020
how do we help

04:18:44.020 --> 04:18:46.020
good thanks

04:18:49.020 --> 04:18:51.020
this one is also regular housing

04:18:51.020 --> 04:18:53.020
what one is this

04:19:01.020 --> 04:19:03.020
1110

04:19:03.020 --> 04:19:05.020
1110 is regular housing

04:19:05.020 --> 04:19:07.020
1110 is regular housing

04:19:08.020 --> 04:19:10.020
1117 is regular housing

04:19:15.020 --> 04:19:17.020
12 is medical

04:19:20.020 --> 04:19:22.020
16

04:19:26.020 --> 04:19:28.020
station robot

04:19:28.020 --> 04:19:30.020
I think this is a robot

04:19:30.020 --> 04:19:32.020
station robot

04:19:32.020 --> 04:19:34.020
but there is no machine

04:19:34.020 --> 04:19:36.020
so 18 is either housing or robot

04:19:40.020 --> 04:19:42.020
13 is

04:19:49.020 --> 04:19:51.020
housing

04:19:55.020 --> 04:19:57.020
good night

good night everyone

04:20:13.020 --> 04:20:15.020
and 119 is a robot station

04:20:15.020 --> 04:20:17.020
here

04:20:17.020 --> 04:20:19.020
can I

04:20:19.020 --> 04:20:21.020
still time travel

04:20:21.020 --> 04:20:23.020
I can

04:20:47.020 --> 04:20:49.020
I
