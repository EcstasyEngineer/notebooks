She says she could only show us how to make it and she's done it like twice so far.
She's like you just have to watch me because I can't tell you.
So we can do as is watch watch her.
Do you also hate Mondays?
I guess I'm not really I'm not really Monday hater but
I'm not I don't really have much to do except for like my doctor's appointments on Mondays
and I kind of look forward to taking a walk outside.
It's like the only time I go outside.
This is when I go to my doctor's appointment and the weather is really nice lately.
The trees are growing.
The terriblossums bloomed for a little while and it was really pretty.
I was so pretty.
I like going outside.
It's really nice going on a walk feeling the nice gentle breeze on my skin.
As long as it's not raining, it's fine rain on a Monday kind of sucks.
I don't know why.
Did you get your glasses and must know?
I don't do that till tomorrow today Sunday.
Today Sunday Sunday Sunday Sunday.
I said I'd call them to make sure that it's still there.
Oh, that reminds me.
I was literally trying.
Okay, so I missed a package from I missed a package from the delivery and
I had to call them as well today.
I had to call them as well today and I called them and I called.
They made me go on the website and they're like, oh, put in your your
your tracking number.
Put in a tracking number.
And then all that telling me that my package can't be redelivered.
I'm I'm so I'm getting upset.
I'm upset.
I don't want to think about that.
I'm aggravating me.
Just give me my give me my package, please.
Thank you.
And then they're like, oh, then ask us where is your package?
Yes, where is it?
I put it in the tracking number.
Oh, it's nowhere to be seen.
This does not exist.
Like what do you mean?
It doesn't exist.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm aggravating.
I do all that too.
I love the rain.
Honestly, I love the rain.
But what I don't like about the rain is the location.
City rain is gross.
The city is gross.
It's garbage everywhere.
It's not clean.
It's gross, filthy, filthy.
Just things everywhere.
I love the rain.
It's been in dance in the rain, if I could.
But it's really gross outside.
Over.
You know, I also have been forgetting to take my vitamins.

And they have a limit, a cap limit of how much they can give you over the counter, the cap limit was 200 IU 200 200 can have any more than that, you know how do you know how much she gave me, can you guess how much IU she gave me IU caps she gave me for each cap.
It's over 9000. How could this be?
Sorry.
He triggered a memory. That chatter triggered a memory. I'm sorry.
Is that it? Is that everyone's guesses? 400, 500, 400, 500, 1,000, 500, 5, 100, 5,000.
Is that all your guesses?
Alright, so what they prescribed me was actually 50,000.
50,000 IU. 50,000.
50,000 IU.
I feel like alive, right? Yeah, I'm alive. I'm okay.
I have to take one every week. One cap a week.
And I keep forgetting to take it. I suppose I took it on Friday on Friday, but I forgot.
Friday passed and I was like, did I take this? I saw it sitting behind my TV and I'm like, did I take that?
I'm like, no, I did not. I definitely did not.
Yeah, every Friday I was supposed to take it. Now it's every Sunday now since I took it before I started the stream.
Is there ever a bone marrow transplant? No. I hear it hurts and I hear you have to be awake for it.
It sounds terrifying.
It sounds scary.
It's over 9,000 then literally.
Keep your phone always with you. My phone is always with me. It's right here.
It's right here. One second.
One second.
One second.
One second.
One second.
One second.
Yeah, that's how low. That's why you're not supposed to be in the single digits of your vitamins, especially vitamin D.
And I found out that low vitamin B count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.
I found out.
I didn't know that.

Well now you guys get to hear it though because I fixed my, I officially fixed my mic settings.
I'm so happy. I think I mentioned this yesterday. I'm so happy.
Every time I went high pitch my microphone went and pick it up.
But I think my microphone can now pick it up.
I think I'm good. I'm good for now.
So now you can hear all my ranges because my microphone before couldn't pick up my laugh.
I bet you guys still don't even really know what my real laugh is like.
My real life is my, my, my, well I mean they're all my real laughs but I guess when I really laugh really really hard it goes up really really really high.
If I laugh really really really hard my laugh becomes extremely high pitched.
Thus my mic doesn't pick it up. Thus it sounds like I'm not responding to people but I'm busy laughing.
So you can never hear it. All my previous streams whenever I laughed my microphone couldn't pick it up.
No you don't want to hear that. You don't want to hear that.
You don't want to hear that.
You didn't turn up great. I'm so happy. I hope my microphone sounds okay.
I feel like I could do a little better. I feel like if I cut out or dip or anything just let me know.
I can easily fix it. Let me know. Let me know.
You want a highest note? I could say Ara Ara.
And then a lowest note.
You really need to hear it. My laugh.
Quick so I'll make her laugh. Like a submarine radar.
I wheeze when I laugh too hard. I snort when I laugh too hard.
Or when something catches me off guard. I snort.
It's brown and sticky.
Poop. Poop. Poop is brown and sticky.
Poop. Poop-o.
Poop. Poop.
Poop. Poop. Poop.
Poop. Poop. Poop.
Poop. Poop. Poop.
Poop. Poop. Poop.
I'm sorry. I didn't like that emo.
I like the red face emo a lot.
I don't know why I like trolling and then feeling as if I annoyed you so much and then this face pops up.
It makes me laugh.
I laugh every time I lose connection and you guys use this face.
I laugh the entire time. It's so funny.
It's so hilarious.
I love that face so much.
I think the only time I snorted was when I tripped the robot in stray.
It's so funny.
My side hurts.
I'd rather you guys show disappointment in my stupid jokes.
Is that weird?
Is that weird? Am I weird for that?
Is that a weird thing?
Is that weird?
If you guys laugh, I'm like, that wasn't funny.
Why are you laughing?
But I take great pleasure when you are all disappointed in my dumb jokes.
Help, I can't stop laughing.
Am I an M? I don't know. I don't know. I don't think so.
I don't know. Maybe to an extent.
Any further than that, I'll probably get upset.
I'll probably get a little ingy.
I don't think I'm an M.
Is it levels for you?
Yeah, it's levels for me.
To a great extent.
She just likes being annoying.
I do. I really do.
I do like being annoying.
I take great pleasure in it.
Seeing the disdain on your face from my stupidity.
Is that so bad?
Just straight disdain.
You're supposed to comfort.
I do. I comfort you after I annoy you.
After I tease and annoy you, I comfort you after.
Oh, was it?
Glad you enjoyed it.
Is that a type of aftercare?
Yeah, of course.
It's got the zoomies.
I did drink with some soda.
So I have a lot of sugar in me right now.
I just cracked my thumbs.
Why did the bike fall over?
The only reason why that made me laugh
is because I fell off the bike.
The only reason why that made me laugh
is because I fell off the bike.
The only reason why that made me laugh
is because I fell off the bike.
How do you crack your thumbs?
Oh, I pull them.
I pull them or accidentally bend them.
I bend them accidently.
Like I put my hand on the table.
And if my thumb is folded in front of my palm,
like in front of the hand,
and then I put my hand down,
it cracks.
I gotta do that.
This doesn't look like a supermarket.
We're getting there.
We're gonna be in the supermarket.
God, this is great, fine.
Let's get on over in the supermarket.
We're gonna run out of supermarket.
God, you're so impatient.
You don't want to even want to talk to me.
Whatever.
Fine.
We won't.
Sit and chat.
We'll go in the game.

Hi, welcome in, welcome in. Thank you, Ran.
Really, thank you so much for the red. How was your stream? What did you play?
Welcome in.
It's very nice to meet all of you. My name is Azur Dulay. If you haven't already heard of me, I am your fertility goddess from Bialor.
Welcome in.
So if you need to go rest, rain, I appreciate it.
I understand that if you have to rain and go, go eat, rest, drink water, eat food. Thank you so much.
It was fun. I see you're getting milk.
I'm more like selling my milk.
If you would like to purchase some, you can purchase some.
I can give you a discount.
Now water is important. Why is water important? Are you thirsty?
I give cute girl discount.
You'll get your turn chat. You'll get your turn. You'll get your little discount as well.
Eventually. What a goddess gotta do, what a goddess gotta do. Just gotta make some money.
It's over.
$100?
He looks suspicious. I won't question anything.
$200 for $299.
Am I in it? I am.
$199.
Why does this FBI agent keep coming into my store? He's scary. He's scaring me. What does he need flour for?
He's watching me.
He took sprints out. Did you get the milk out, Leia?
I am.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, you too. Milk and cheese, I see how it is.
Oh, it's you again. Hi.
I really like that tank top.
Oh, thank you.
Will you sell cereal too? Do you really want cereal with your milk? You want cereal, you just don't want my milk alone. Do you want cereal?
Here, I will avoid a pole.
And cereal.
Is that it? Anyone else?
My ear is ringing. Oh my god.
cereal is called Chucky Pig.
It looks like graham crackers in the shape of a bear.
Chocolate flavor.
Chocolate cereal with chocolate milk.
You don't have chocolate powder, but it comes from a chocolate goat.
Let me turn this off.
Is this okay? Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I keep going back here.
Because you love it here, that's why. You love it here.
You love it here. You're obsessed with me.
You need me. Just like how I need you.
Yes?
Glad. Yay. Hey, can you hear me?
Let you go?
You think I have a hold on you? I don't have to do anything. All I have to do is talk sweet nothings into your ear and you'll be back.
You'll be back.
I'll give you free reign.
All of you are already mine. You already belong to me. What do I need to fight for?
You don't want your goddess?
Can't get over chocolate. Have you eaten cocoa puffs? I have. I'm not a big fan of cocoa puffs though.
I do like Reese's puffs.
Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs.
I've been about a chocolate famous.
Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs.
I can't watch the homies now. I keep coming back here.
I'm sure the homies will understand.
They might make fun of you and then they'll be back in here too.
Cherry goat cinnamon goat crunch.
Goat goat puffs.
I like that a lot. Someone needs to draw those.
My own personal cereal. Special cereal that you can eat with my milk.
But my favorite cereal is actually Captain Crunch.
I burnt that up last time.
It's Captain Crunch. Favorite flavor is peanut butter.
Peanut butter. Captain Crunch. It's so good. I'll eat it without milk.
Just be careful with the roof of your mouth.
Captain Crunch will destroy it. Absolutely destroy it.
Lord in by the milk held by the siren voice.
You like it?
I mean, I can get even deeper into your ear.
I can take over your mind.
But I don't have hypnosis.
I can't do something like what the siren can do.
Hypnosis is the milk.
Who told you this?
You're not supposed to know.
Ow! My cup hit my tooth.
Now I have to eat you.
I like all of Captain Crunch cereal.
But my favorite cereal out of the Captain Crunch is probably the peanut butter.
But I do mix it. Mix it up. Mix it up. Mix it up.
I'm so excited for more. I hope you can tell about it.
We're going to be doing... Oh, I forgot to... I completely forgot to release that.
I completely forgot. I'll do it after the stream.
I completely forgot to release my schedule.
Oopsie. You have to not cross my mind.
I don't know what to do with you.
I don't know what to do with you.
I'm such a good streamer.
I don't know what to do with you.
I look a bit scuffed. No!
It's anything but the scuff.
Why?
I have a special ingredient to make my milk. Do you want to know what it is?
Do you want to know? Do you want to know what it is?
Yeah?
Well, I think it's love. Now it's you.
I'm back.
I'm back.
I'm back.
I'm back.
I'm back.
I'm back. All the lurkers got terrified.
All the lurkers who were not really listening.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

Do it for the milk.
Do it for the milk.
Do it for the milk.
Oh, do you actually want to know an actual educational...
an actual educational thing, though?
Jokes aside.
Jokes aside.
Well, you see,
when women give birth, right?
And they breastfeed.
And there was a lady who...
who pumps her...
she pumps her breast milk.
She pumps it.
And she was really scared that it...
she was really confused of why I kept turning pink,
like strawberry milk.
It's actually...
we can actually produce strawberry milk.
It's actually possible.
The reason for that is because
a tiny bit of blood
gets into the...
into the breast milk.
A tiny bit of blood.
So...
This is actually true.
This is a true fact.
Don't...
Just look it up. Google it.
Google it.
You see?
I could have been...
I could have been...
It's true.
That's not true, Raymond.
Like that.
Did it taste like strawberry, though?
I mean, it can.
Sometimes it tastes a little sweet.
Like it happens, too.
Like it's 100% happened where it tastes sweet.
After all, you are still drinking milk.
I think it depends on her diet.
On her diet as well, so...
Blood milk and strawberry milk.
Strawberry milk.
I see.
I see.
Google it. Google it.
It's true. It can happen.
He cursed strawberry milk.
Mmm.
Four.
Two.
You know, if it wasn't for machines...
I wouldn't be able to do math.
Math is hard.
Is it your blood?
Is it?
Is it my blood?
I mean, it could be.
But sacrifices are needed.
But is my blood red, though?
Is my blood red?
What if my blood is golden?
Are you sure it's my blood?
Have you ever seen a goddess bleed?
Have you ever seen a goddess bleed?
Have you ever seen a goddess bleed?
Tell me.
What if it's acidic like an alien?
Am I an alien?
Am I an alien?
Am I an alien now?
No. Give that back.
To expender. To expender.
To expender.
Is that it?
I was only seven?
I have cereal.
Two.
Do you think he's gonna get away with it?
Haha, you didn't get away with it.
You thought you could try to grab it before I take the prize.
You thought you could try to grab it before I take the prize.
You thought you could try to grab it before I take the prize.
Get off!
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm gonna buy my cereal.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
They're goddess.
So don't be scared.
Don't be scared.
It's illial.
It's illial.
What a friend.
Consent is sexy.
Sometimes.
Very sexy.
Huh? What? What?
What happened? What happened?
Huh? What?
Mm-hmm.
What?
The area of cereal for the milk.
Is it healthy?
Cereal for the milk.
Mm-hmm.
This is no cup.
What do you mean?
Yes, eight dollars for the cereal.
Why? Because look.
Look, look.
It says market price.
Market price is six dollars and sixty-two cents.
We gotta make a little more than that, you know?
So it's wise to make it a dollar more.
A dollar or two dollars more.
I mean, we're looking at the market price.
Fuck this price. Whatever this is.
We're looking at this.
This is what it sells for.
So we do a little more than that.
Otherwise, I'd be making no money.
I'd be broke.
I'm gonna be a broke-go.
You want me to be a broke-go to you?
I believe you're getting crazy.
I broke God's hands from earlier.
I...
I...
Boat for the milk.
Milk for the cereal. The internal cycle of a syrup.
You're mistaking market price and cost.
We're not paying attention to this.
This is nothing.
What do you mean? Mistaking?
They're still buying it, aren't they?
Aren't they?
They're still buying it.
I see no problems here.
They're still buying it.
If they had a problem, they wouldn't be buying it.
Are you going to the next day?
Oh, right. Enter.
Okay.
So we have bread, we have milk, we have cheese.
What else do we need?
We need $550 to unlock.
Oh, the special milk.
Special milk.
The fresher kind of milk.
We need this.
That one right there.
Extremely fresh.
Delicious.
Delicious? Delicious.
Delicious milk.
Delicious.
Delish.
Straight from the top.
It's the milk that you can leave on the counter.
Right after.
Purchase.
We need this one.
Do we have to buy this?
Like in order to buy this?
Do we have to buy this?
What else do we need?
Salt and rice.
Oh, I like rice though.
We don't need all of these.
We don't need any of these.
We don't need the salt, peanut butter, flour, olive oils, pasta, rice and salt.
What we need is milk.
We need more milk.
We want this right there.
We want milk and we want yogurt.
More cereal.
Milk, yogurt.
Oh, cakes.
Cakes.
Yeah, there's different levels to milk.
There's processed milk.
Like after they take the milk from me.
I got you little lambs.
Little lambs.
Thank you so much for the $1.
To be miss Morgan.
Morgan.
My little lambs.
Thank you so much for the $1.
To be miss Morgan.
Morgan.
My little lambs.
Oh, watching you all pull this so cute.
My little lambs.
The hallucinogens you put in the milk is working mama.
Now we just got to sacrifice them.
Smiley face.
Sacrifice.
Sacrifice.
Sacrifice.
Sacrifice.
Thanks for the $3.
To be miss Misaka.
Misaka.
Misaka.
Misaka best.
Sacrifice.
Sacrifice.
Sacrifice.
Sacrifice.
Oh, there's a long line.
Hi, oh my gosh.
Hi, oh gosh.

A little baby boy scared, scared to accept your fate.
Your loyalty should not bound, you cannot escape this goddess.
Are you sure you want someone as useless as you?
Your uselessness means nothing, because you are already of use to me, as long as I have your heart.
Everything I ever wanted, each and every one of you.
A piece for the phabias.
I can't give you all a piece, did you forget that I can get really, really big?
The bigger I can get, the more of you I can hold.
Ah, so cute.
You are all my precious little babies.
And nothing can take that away.
The only one that gets in your way is yourself, and all you have to do is let it go and accept your fate.
What are you scared of?
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Mommy's here, mommy's got you, mommy's going to hold you.
Yes, yes, I'll piece for the phabias.
Melgue's for the phabias.
Arra, ara.
Your soothing voice helps me keep going.
You are the sweetest woman in your generation and a blessing for a man's mental health.
Thank you Azura.
Wow, it's so sweet of you to say anonymous. Thank you for the $1 to happy. Thank you.
So sweet.
Oh, I have to sneeze.
Oh my gosh, my eyes are watery.
Don't die, don't die.
Thank you for the $3 to happy.
Thank you, thank you.
Don't die, you must live, you must survive.
I'm a survivor, I wanna make it.
I'm a survivor, keep on surviving.
Thank you for the blessures.
Is that Leopold?
I want to keep listening to you, but I need to go to sleep for work tomorrow. So conflicting. May I get a hug and kiss goodnight mommy?
Thank you so much for the $1 to happy. I'm the late lover. Here's your hug.
Good night.
Do I kill you guys? Chat time.
They're dead, they're dead.
Thank you for the $1 to happy.
It was my mouth, but I stood tall. I can wonder what other things are standing tall.
Thank you for the $1 to happy.
Thank you for the $1 to happy.
Oh that's so bright, oh my eyeballs.
Okay, I wanna see if I can buy that thing now or buy any level 9.
I don't trust it. I feel like I'm playing Pokemon all over again. You know, when the game crashes, so you're so scared of your process being lost and when you play Pokemon on the DS, so you save it every 2 minutes.
That's what I feel like right now.
Because there's no warning when it crashes or anything, it just closes the game. That's it, just close. I've boop, gone.
Better channel doesn't have our ASMRs. Well, yeah, it's unfortunate. I only had one ASMR though. I believe next week I'll be having another ASMR, but I think it's gonna be called ASMR.
If you understand my grip, we gotta be more safe with the thickness that we do on here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, see, yeah, see, yeah.
Oh, she scared me. She scared me so bad. I don't think anyone else is gonna come in here. Yeah, she, yeah.
Big toe.
Anyone else? Nobody else? Anybody else wanna come in here? Anybody else? Nobody else? Ah, see? Alright, I see all this.
And I closed door. Yay! And now it saves, right? I don't see it.
We're like barely making any money with our milk.
It stays.
I hear. Oh. Since whole yapping. This goat mafia you see. I'm hungry. I wanna eat. I wanna eat food.
Yeah, no more cookie eating for the ASMR.
Nope. No toast today. Instead, I'm going to eat weyanya. Weyanya. I'm going to eat weyanya.
Weyanya. Weyanya.
FBI agents coming to have a taste of my milk. It's definitely chocolate.
Why are there so many FBI agents in here?
I hear the rumors about your strawberry milk. Hey.
We just use a little bit of powder. A little bit of powder, you know?
Can I hire someone to register? Is that possible? Oh, hiring.
Aww. No, good to see you.
How about we make this the last night and then we just sit and chat? Sit and chat. Sit and chat for a little bit.
But I do want to eat.
Oh, we already had a bread in cereal.
Mmm. I'll take the goat milk entire stock and production and factory all together. It'll cost you.
I don't think you'd have enough to sacrifice to own all of it, now would you? It might cost you more than an arm and a leg.
Maybe your entire heart?
How's the stream going? Really well. I'm enjoying myself. Very much so. Oh, thank God that was empty. Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness. Thank goodness that cup was empty.
That was close. Anyone else? Anybody else?
I'm going to save it for the next day. Save it just in case.
I hear.
Where's your timer for the mess?
Do you think goat mom could crush chat if she wanted to? Yes, she can.
And you'd perish. But would I? No, I wouldn't do that. Why?
Because I need you. I need you. Just like how you need me. I need you.
Well, it's with little babies. How else am I supposed to breed?
How are the tables turned?
What do you mean?
Alright, let me grab me my food and I'll be right back.
Play some sports with each other while I go be right back. Alright, I'm gonna be right back.
I have this pretty screen.
I have this pretty screen.
I have this pretty screen.
I have this pretty screen.
I have this pretty screen.
I have this pretty screen.
I have this pretty screen.
I'm looking at all of you playing all sports.
I'm back.
I have lasagna.
I'm very good. I'm proud of you.
Are you guys eating? I hope you all are eating.
If you can't eat right now, I'll help you eat later.
I need drinks. I still have the soda left over.
Am I peaking?
Is that better? Oh no. That's not what happened.
That's not what happened at all. I know why I'm peaking. Every time I move my keyboard and my keyboard accidentally hits one of my equipment and turns the knob up or down.
Oh my god, it was at 80. I am so sorry.
Oh my god.
My keyboard keeps hitting the knob and turns it up and I have to keep looking out for that. I moved my keyboard out of the way so I could put my plate down.
Is that better? I'm so sorry about that.
It scared me.
It's fine. My ears are yours. I don't want your ears to be destroyed.
If your ears get destroyed, how else are you going to listen to me? You'll be sad. You won't be able to hear my voice anymore.
You'll go crazy. You'll lose your mind.
Do you know how? Because you already got a taste of what my voice already sounds like. You like my voice. You love it. You will be hearing it.
You wait for my streams. Even when I'm gone, you think about my voice. When I stream, you're happy. You like my voice. My voice is there. It's in your ears. You want to hear more.
One day, you lose your hearing. You can't hear anymore. You can't hear. But you want to hear my voice. But you can't hear.
Now you have the thought of what you used to know. All you can do is remember the voice in your head. My voice in your head. You think about it. About what you could do to hear my voice again.
You do anything. Anything. You want to hear my voice. You want to hear my voice. You're losing your mind.
You need to hear my voice. You have to hear my voice. Days go by. You're starting to forget. You're starting to forget. What my voice sounds like. You're gonna forget. You don't want to forget. You want to hear my voice. You want to hear my voice. You're losing your mind. You're going crazy. You want to hear my voice.
Is that what you want to do? Is that what you want to go through?
If you don't want that, take care of your ears. Tell me if my volume peaks. Tell me if it goes low. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience.
If you don't want that, take care of your ears. Tell me if it goes low. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me.

Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's
the horror you want to experience.
There you go.
Help I'm a rock. Help I'm a rock.
I'm already kind of deaf in one ear.
That's all right. You have another ear. Another ear you'll need to take care of.
I'll do my best to let you know. Careful eating mama. Clearly that is just way too up.
I'll be careful.
I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube.
Did I post it yet? No I didn't post it yet. Excuse me. I can post it right now. Give me one second. I have to find it though.
One second please.
I sneezed. Thank you.
Let me grab this. My brain isn't braining right now.
My brain is kind of trying to remember where I put it but it's only in one place and I don't know why I can't remember that place.
I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube.
I'm in love with YouTube.
I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube.
I'm in love with YouTube.
I did it. Yay.
Do you want some Messiah? Open it up.
I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube.
Come on. You'd like it. You love it.
You'd eat it.
I'm a good girl. I'm the best girl.
I'm a good girl.
I'm a good girl. I'm a good girl.
Oh God.
I have a little square left. I've got to gather all of the crumbs together.
The last bite. The last bite.
It's pretty full of crumbs together.
Yeah.
Mmm.
What kind of lasagna was it?
Beef? Beef lasagna?
I don't know. It's homemade lasagna. I don't know.
I don't know about other kinds of lasagna.
I don't know. She's going to move on to us next.
Maybe.
Beef lasagna.
Move. Move. Move.
Move. Move.
How? How to do cow noise?
How is it?
I have really good at doing animal impressions. I never mentioned that in my debut.
Because that was embarrassed. I'm sorry.
But I get really loud when I do it.
I don't know how to whisper to it. It's not possible.
So just then that was probably extremely loud.
I probably woke up someone.
I don't know how to whisper. I have to use my entire vocal box to be able to do it.
For a girl, you're especially good at sounding like a cow.
How are you?
I'm too embarrassed to do any other sounds.
I'm so flustered. My face is burning. Oh my gosh.
I could do a duck. I could do a duck.
I could do chicken. I could do small birds.
I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it.
I didn't mention any of my impressions on debut because I knew I was going to get too embarrassed to do it.
Then I was going to do it and I was going to mess up on doing it.
Then I was going to be so embarrassed that I would want to perish.
I didn't add it at all.
Oh shit.
We're too loud. We're too loud. We're too loud.
Trying to do it and whisper is so hard.
It's so hard. How do you whisper and make noises?
Why? Don't tell him.
Don't tell him.
I can't do the rooster noise. The one that wakes you up in the morning because it's way too loud.
There's a quiet one. There you go.
How do you whisper? It's so hard.
No.
What a cute poem.
Look at that.
That one hurts.
I'm a kitty.
I'm a kitty.
We used to yell at each other all the time.
I miss him so much.
We just go back and forth doing that to each other.
I miss him so much.
Hello. Hi.
I didn't voice-act the cat and stray. The cat and stray is actually voice-acted and modeled after an actual cat.
And he is a cutie. Such a cutie. Did you see him?
I can never take the job of a real cat.
I was meat stuck in my teeth.
Did they hire cat voice actor? Not a real person but an actual cat.
Thanks we got a real cat and let him meow into a microphone.
I think it's the same cat that we also put the tape and stuff over.
And the cat walked around with the stuff all over it.
I liked the behind the scene video. It was very cute.
Have you guys seen the video of the cat doing the stuff for the game?
It's an actual kitty cat.
Sorry to serve. I'll show you.
Hi.
Oops.
Ignore that.
Yeah but how do I make it?
Is it lost? Work for me.
I can't do that. It's so dumb.
Close.
Again you are going to fight over us.
It's not what I want to move. It's not what I moved.
Work with me. Work with me.
Do you literally have the thingy up? It's not working.
I changed it. Why is it not working? What happened?
What the heck? What's happening? What can I...
No.
I did it. I'm so smart.
Let's go. I'm intelligent.
I'm so smart. Oh my god. You believe it how smart I am?
I'm so smart. Is this too small? Should I make it bigger?
Is this too small?
This is a kitty cat.
This is a cat that they have for the thingy. I don't even think you can hear it.
Hang on.
You can't hear it. I can't hear it.
Sorry. I heard myself. My apologies.
Ew. I heard myself.
How do I move it?
Can you hear it now?
Now there. I went through all that for a really short video.
Today we are group.
I can't really watch it alone.
I'd watch memes and videos with you guys.
I can't hear it.
The fat cat. Big chunkers.
Where the cats paid? I think the owners were paid.
I think the owners got paid for their kitty cat audition.
Maybe we can add that to a dono.
Where you guys submit your funniest memes to me.
I'll have someone go through them before sending them to me.
Just in case you guys send me something out of this world.
I don't trust you to be good but I don't trust all of you.
I don't trust you to be good but I don't trust all of you.
If I don't laugh at your memes don't take it the hard way right?
There's only so many things that can really make me laugh and my humor is kind of lost.
I laugh at the dumbest things and I really like people falling.
I don't know it's hard to explain. It's like a specific kind of funny.
It's like people get caught doing something they're not supposed to.
Other people laughing about it.
Caught lacking not me.
As long as they don't get seriously hurt is this fine with me.
As long as someone gets horrendously hurt or really badly hurt.
Make me go oof.
But every now and then it's fine.
You know how when you're like scrolling memes.
Scrolling the memes and you're scrolling and scrolling.
Ha ha hee hee every now and then and then you get hit with a random fall meme.
It gives you a good laugh.
Do you want to scroll through my tiktok?
Well if we scroll through tiktok it will be on the new account which I haven't really been on.
I just like set it up because I was thinking of doing it like for like a regular satsudan.
Just a sit chat and watch memes.
I did not take my med.
I'm going to do that now.
Also busy eating.
Like junkers.
I'm taking it.
I took it.
I was eating.
See be proud of me because I remembered.
See proud of me I remembered on my own.
I remembered.
Do you like waffles?
And then you have to say yeah we like waffles.
Do you like waffles?
Do you like pancakes?
Do you care to get a mouthful?
It's so old.
Someone knows.
Someone knows.
Someone knows.
Do you like waffles?
Yeah we like waffles.
I like the sign.
Do you care to get a mouthful?
Do you care to get a mouthful?
Do you like waffles?
Do you like french toast?
Do you like french toast?
Is there your age is showing?
Trust that song does not show my age.
It does not.
Not one bit.
Not one bit at all.
He's a cat.
Flushing the toilet.
He's a cat.

Flushing the toilet.
He's a cat.

I am back.
I would never abandon you. Never. Never abandon you.
I would never abandon you. Never. Never.
It's okay, don't be scared. Mommy's back now.
You don't get the milk as broke. I give it to you every day. Are you ever gonna get tired of it?
No, I don't.
Never. Never. Never.
It won't leave again, right?
If I do leave, right?
It is only going to be for a little while. Only for a short while, yeah?
It's just a short while, and you guys can wait for me, right?
Mommy has to go every now and then.
Mommy has to.
Mommy is going to be gone for the next two days, and she'll be back. Don't worry.
Mommy will be back on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, you guys can wait till then, yes?
No.
Today is a period. There is no misery. You guys will be fine.
I am not abandoning you. Azra has things to do on those two days. Mondays and Tuesdays are very busy days for me.
Very busy days, and then you have me Wednesday all the way to Sunday.
So many things planned for you guys. So many things.
You're not getting abandoned. No one is getting abandoned.
Mommy is taking care of her health for you. If mommy doesn't take care of her health, there will be no mommy.
If mommy doesn't take care of her health, there will be no mommy.
Mommy is crying.
Mommy is crying.
In the meantime, while you all wait for me to come back, you can send me sweet, sweet morals.
You can send me morals, sweet messages, like there's letters to me, and I'll read them, and I'll go over them, and I'll heart them, so I know that I read them.
Okay, send me morals. That's fine. I'll take your morals.
I'm not really bothered by all the other morals. I just wanted to talk about it a little bit, that it was silly. That's all.
And I'll be the last time I talk about those morals, alright?
That is the last.
But other than that, I have received so many kind morals from so many of you already, and I feel so bad that I haven't responded to some of them, but I have given a lot of hearts to them.
I think I was told that you guys can still see when I heart a moral.
I think.
So, send me your sweet words, and I'll listen to them. I'll read them.
I started responding to really old morals that I didn't respond to like 14 days ago.
I think I'm now in the 12 days ago ones, so it's taking me time, but I'll get through it.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, so, you can like literally see, I think, a few morals that I made public, I think.
If you like scroll down the moral page, you can like scroll down. You can see the ones I have publicly responded to, so that you guys do not ask me the same questions over and over again.
I'm sorry if I don't answer some questions, but I get asked some questions like 20 times already and counting, so I just give it a heart and then I go past it.
It's been 84 years.
Read material as not to miss you.
If you guys haven't seen some of my vans or my past dreams, you can go take a look at those.
There's also the Patreon. You can visit the Patreon.
You can go in there.
There's also like in the future there will be other videos. There's as more download on the Twitter if you couldn't find that.
There's that. There's also my art that I do on the old. There's so much material already out and ready for you.
So if you really want to get that material, you know where to visit. Just check out in the description below.
It's not the same. How is it not the same? It's me. It's all me.
You can also buy my merch, buy the merch, and you can literally have me closer to your heart than ever before.
It's inevitable, sadly.
I might have to do more on the VOD Squad since my hour is at Oracle Chance. That's perfectly fine. I don't mind.
Whenever you have the time, you'll always bop in because I believe in your loyalty. I believe in it.
Don't worry. I believe in you. And I'll always be streaming for you.
A bottle of drool.
I'm glad I got a bit of the stream. Glad to have you here. We're just about to end it though.
We're going to pop in and raid Marseille. Sweet baby Marseille.
And she's doing a karaoke stream today, I think. Yeah, she's doing a karaoke stream.
To get to hear her sing, because I can't. Not yet.
And you to hear her sing, you can hear her sweet little voice.
I'm actually excited to listen to it a little bit.
You'll be waiting for my karaoke one day? Yeah, I'll do a karaoke stream.
I know tons of songs already.
Maybe, but it'll probably be an unarchived, however you say it, stream so that I don't get smacked with anything bad.
It sums to radio. That'd be fun.
I would have to learn a bunch of songs in some long language.
He is irate.
Like the Stardew Valley. Stardew Streams aren't karaoke enough.
They were, but because they weren't marked as so, I got hit.
I got copyrighted in that stream, in both of them.
So we got to be careful in normal streaming.
I'm probably going to get hit for playing that one jingle just for a little bit.
So I'm probably going to go and mute that section of the stream.
Because I completely forgot when I played it.
Oopsie, I forgot, I forgot, I'm stupid.
Yeah, I better be safe than sorry, yeah.
I gotta stop forgetting, I gotta remember, but I do just like singing some jingles that pop into my head.
I'm sure you never know, yeah.
Alright, so if you guys haven't already done so, please leave a like and subscribe.
Smash that like button and subscribe and ring the bell to hit notifications.
And I'll see you all in two days. Alright, two days, two, two days.
You guys will be fine, two days.
You have the other girls you can watch and enjoy.
Watch my little babies, okay.
Subscribe.
Alright, goodbye everyone.
See you in two days.
On Wednesday, I'll post my schedule up right after.
And I'll see my schedule and what we have planned for the week.
Yay, good night everyone, night night.
And I hope you all had a wonderful, happy Father's Day.
Bye bye.
Good night Daddy.
