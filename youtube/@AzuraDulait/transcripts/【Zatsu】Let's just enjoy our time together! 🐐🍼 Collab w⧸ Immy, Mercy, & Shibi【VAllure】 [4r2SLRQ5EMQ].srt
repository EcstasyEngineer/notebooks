00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:07,560
We might do some like Q&A and then some like would you rather questions or like will you press the button questions or just maybe we'll just tell each other really bad pickup lines there.

15
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
Try to raise each other up.

16
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,560
We spent like what was it like the first.

17
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
It was like an hour.

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,560
It was a legit hour.

19
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,560
Yeah like an hour trying to make this work and I'm so sorry everyone that it didn't work out.

20
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Literally Ubisoft said you don't own Uno and I said what do you mean it's right here.

21
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:36,560
Yeah I purchased it and did like family sharing from our other accounts and then to let me had to buy it on our normal accounts and that still didn't work.

22
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,560
Only it only worked for me and Emmy and Azura and then it just wouldn't open and then it just nothing was working.

23
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
It was so dumb.

24
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
It was press play and then just close it out again.

25
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
Press play, close it out again.

26
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
Crash.

27
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,560
So I hate Ubisoft.

28
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
We all hate Ubisoft.

29
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
We all hate Ubisoft.

30
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,560
We all hate Ubisoft in this house.

31
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
That's why my thumbnail is annoying.

32
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
We paid twice.

33
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,560
We paid twice and it still didn't work.

34
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
They're just trying to steal our money.

35
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,560
I can't wait to refund every game title from them.

36
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,560
Sending the CEO a personalized letter.

37
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,560
Sending the CEO a seasoned assist.

38
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,560
It doesn't make any sense but I'm doing it.

39
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:36,560
But yeah if you guys have questions for us let's do, we'll do a couple of would you, will you press the button questions and then you guys can come up with questions and post them in our respective chats.

40
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,560
And then maybe we'll read like one from each of our chats.

41
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,560
The questions are going to be like did you guys have sex in real life yet?

42
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,560
When are you going to have sex in real life?

43
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Not yet.

44
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
With each other?

45
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
Soon.

46
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Very soon.

47
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,560
But yeah that will give you some time to think of questions to ask us.

48
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
Let's see.

49
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Let me find a good will you.

50
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,560
I'm wondering if I should do this one.

51
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,560
I don't think we want to be based right off the bat.

52
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
I do!

53
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,560
I'm going to send you guys a screenshot of the question it just asked.

54
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
I'm dying.

55
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
Oh god here you go.

56
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
What is the screenshot?

57
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
It's in general.

58
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Oh shit.

59
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Maybe not that close.

60
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
I'm not American I don't care.

61
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
Maybe not that one.

62
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Maybe not that one.

63
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
I'm not American but.

64
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Some Americans might get triggered.

65
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,560
A lot of people said no to that question.

66
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,560
They wouldn't pass the point which is funny.

67
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
This one doesn't make any sense.

68
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
What though?

69
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
I don't like these.

70
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,560
You will become an extremely attractive girl but no guys will find you attractive.

71
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

72
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
What?

73
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
It makes sense.

74
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
I would be extremely attractive.

75
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,560
I'm already an extremely attractive girl.

76
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
What's there to lose?

77
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Oh okay here you go.

78
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
Will you press the button?

79
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,560
If you could change the weather at will.

80
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,560
But the weather you choose lasts for a month.

81
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
Yes.

82
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
Mercy was that a no for me?

83
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
That was a no for me.

84
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
Okay.

85
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Was there a no life?

86
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
It's crazy.

87
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
It's changed at will?

88
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Yeah you can change the weather at will.

89
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
But the weather you choose lasts for a month.

90
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
Oh I will not press the button.

91
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,560
I think I just like rain a lot and I don't want to terrain for a month though.

92
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Oh I do.

93
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
You would?

94
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
I do want to terrain for a month.

95
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
I would just be emo.

96
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,560
I thought you meant like season.

97
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
I don't know why.

98
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
I thought it was the season.

99
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Weather.

100
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,560
No I don't want it to last a month.

101
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
I think that would be too much.

102
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
People said they would press the button for that.

103
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
Yeah it's a weather.

104
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Yeah it ran.

105
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,560
Because they probably be like oh I want it to be sunny.

106
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
No I want it.

107
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
I want the opposite.

108
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Fuck the sun dude.

109
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
I mean I got a basement.

110
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
And all the senpais are there.

111
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,560
They'll all drown if there's too much rain.

112
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
But a month is so long.

113
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Yeah you could have given floods.

114
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
Yeah depends where people are.

115
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Okay here's the next one.

116
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,560
You can revive and keep loved ones from dying.

117
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,560
But every time you use your powers 50,000 people will die.

118
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
I think it's a good idea.

119
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
For my big brother yes.

120
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
I'm pressing it.

121
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
I'm conflicted.

122
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Because I would just kill a senpai.

123
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,560
If I even suspect anything.

124
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
But then I already have Emmy.

125
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Who can already do that.

126
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Yeah but usually I don't know.

127
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,560
I don't know.

128
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
I don't know.

129
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
I don't know.

130
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,560
But usually Emmy's powers come with a sort of twist.

131
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
No humans need to die.

132
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
No one needs to die.

133
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
Everyone live.

134
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,560
I'm killing 50,000 people to bring that back to my house.

135
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Can I choose who to die though?

136
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Like 50,000?

137
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,560
You want to choose 50,000 people specifically by name?

138
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
I can choose a country right?

139
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Which country are you choosing?

140
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Okay.

141
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
No don't.

142
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Anyway.

143
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,560
That one was almost split.

144
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,560
People put 45% and 55% said no.

145
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Can I kill a country?

146
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,560
Ethno cleansing from Mercy over here.

147
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
I'm joshing.

148
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
I'm joshing around.

149
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
I'm not joshing.

150
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
I want to do the...

151
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
I want to do it too.

152
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,560
Should we all do the poll?

153
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Where is this poll?

154
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Oh I'm just reading off the questions from the website.

155
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,560
You receive a diary that tells you everything that happens in the future.

156
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:42,560
But you'll participate in a game where you have to be hunted down by other diary users that can also see the future.

157
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Ooh that sounds like an anime.

158
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Yeah right?

159
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
It should be.

160
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
It should be.

161
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
Future diary?

162
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
Oh wait, yeah that's wait.

163
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,560
That's fucking true actually.

164
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,560
I'm like why does it sound so familiar?

165
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
I would do it.

166
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
I would do it.

167
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,560
It sounds fun.

168
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
And plus you have a diary and it tells you.

169
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Yeah that's true.

170
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,560
I feel like would you be clever enough to outwit other diary users though?

171
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
What do you mean outwit?

172
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
We just killed them.

173
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
But they're going to try to kill you too.

174
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
They also have the diary.

175
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Yeah but I'll kill them first.

176
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
I'm not if I kill them first.

177
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,560
I think I would die so I won't kill them.

178
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
You find five dollars, but...

179
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
You find five dollars, but...

180
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
You give it back to the person who dropped it.

181
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,560
No!

182
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
No!

183
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
It's a five dollars is mine.

184
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Yeah.

185
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Maybe I want to feel good for that day and be like yeah I did something nice.

186
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
You feel good by stealing five dollars.

187
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
Yeah exactly.

188
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Five finger discount and get five dollars.

189
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
I'll mine if I do.

190
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
Yeah.

191
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
I wish I could make it smaller.

192
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
Probably do it though.

193
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,560
I mean like that's something I just do normal.

194
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Okay stop being a good person.

195
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Yeah what the fuck.

196
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
I mean I'm a terrible person.

197
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,560
So awful.

198
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,560
I think babies are gross and...

199
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Babies are gross.

200
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,560
I don't know if I can ask this word.

201
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
Ask it.

202
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Ask it.

203
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
You have the house of your dreams.

204
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
Furniture etc.

205
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
All included.

206
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
But it's in Somalia.

207
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,560
What's wrong with Somalia?

208
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Well specifically it's in Mogadishu Somalia.

209
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,560
Which is not the same place.

210
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,560
Oh I don't know anything about that place.

211
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,560
Okay ignore that one.

212
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
I'll skip it.

213
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
I'll skip it.

214
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
Yeah we'll skip that.

215
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
Pirates?

216
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,560
What?

217
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,560
Furniture.

218
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
Wow there's a lot of murderous questions.

219
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,560
You save 10,000 people around the world.

220
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,560
But you have to drown a person with your bare hands.

221
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
Easy.

222
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
Easy peasy.

223
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
I've already done that before.

224
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
I've already done that before.

225
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
You've already done that before?

226
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,560
I'll just choose a senpai.

227
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
Yeah someone that's a willing sacrifice?

228
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,560
Well I mean it's not that hard to sacrifice someone.

229
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Yeah maybe yeah.

230
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
Why does every-

231
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Why does all these questions have to do with death?

232
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
What is this?

233
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,560
You'd rather push the button.

234
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,560
This one has to do with the fucking FIFA World Cup.

235
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
So I'm skipping it.

236
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
I don't know anything about FIFA.

237
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
I'm sorry senpai.

238
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,560
I'm sorry pin pals.

239
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
I'm sorry harems.

240
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,560
I'm sorry bleeding hearts.

241
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
I don't know anything about FIFA.

242
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,560
I mean either it's okay.

243
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,560
You can listen to any song with perfect quality in your head.

244
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
At any time.

245
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,560
But you must listen to a 30 second ad after this.

246
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
No.

247
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
No.

248
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
This is just Spotify.

249
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Music.

250
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
Except in your head.

251
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,560
Spotify.

252
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,560
This is the future.

253
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
This is the neural link.

254
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
Yeah I was gonna say.

255
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,560
I'm like this is what Elon Musk is gonna do.

256
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
This is what Elon Musk is trying to do.

257
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
That's what he wants.

258
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
No.

259
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
I would not.

260
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
Yeah I wouldn't either.

261
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
I wouldn't.

262
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,560
Probably also because I don't really listen to music.

263
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,560
Ads are the most annoying thing.

264
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
Yeah.

265
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,560
Especially it's like that really like annoying ad voice.

266
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Like try Lexa Bro.

267
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Wanna break from the ads?

268
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
My favorite hatred of ads is like.

269
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
I can't believe I'm playing this game.

270
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,560
Oh my gosh.

271
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,560
And it's like a really big titty woman walking in a line.

272
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
All men stack on top of her or something.

273
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Wait I've seen that one too.

274
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,560
That like giantist one right?

275
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
Yeah.

276
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,560
I was like Ayo.

277
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,560
How long is the ad?

278
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
How long was the ad?

279
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
It was like 30 seconds.

280
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,560
Yeah like 30 seconds.

281
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
This is a good one.

282
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,560
You become a very famous celebrity.

283
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,560
But you cannot see your family or loved ones often.

284
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
Once a year for a few days.

285
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
Press button.

286
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,560
Press button.

287
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Press button.

288
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
Press press press press.

289
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Press press press press press.

290
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,560
That's slapping.

291
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,560
I'd be really sad without my parents.

292
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
I'd be really sad without my mom.

293
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
I love my parents.

294
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
Get me out of here.

295
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
I could love them.

296
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Get me out of here.

297
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
That's the hard one.

00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
It's just...

308
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,280
No, I understand what you mean.

309
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Living with them can be hard.

310
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,280
You pay with your soul instead of with a rent.

311
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,280
Any person of your choosing will want to have sex with you,

312
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,280
but you will die in five years.

313
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
I'm not pressing the button, this is already my reality.

314
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Fun!

315
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,280
I know, yeah, I love my hair, I love entertaining my hair.

316
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,280
I don't want to die, so no thank you.

317
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
A lot of people said no to that.

318
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,280
You will never experience...

319
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,280
This is a good one for Emmy.

320
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,280
You will never experience difficulty going to the bathroom again,

321
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,280
but you will never remember whether you flushed or not.

322
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,280
This already happens to me!

323
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,280
Sure, I'll press the button, I already don't remember if I flushed.

324
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
Yeah, I press it too.

325
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
Oh my gosh.

326
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,280
It's like muscle memory to flush, no?

327
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
Yeah, so who cares?

328
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,280
And then you're just hoping, because what if you forgot that one time?

329
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,280
Well that's fine, as long as you're not over at a friend's house.

330
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,280
So are you guys pressing the button?

331
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
Yes.

332
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,280
Not pressing the button, I'm already regular.

333
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,280
Mercy doesn't suffer with constipation like the rest of us?

334
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,280
I know, she doesn't have irritable bowel syndrome or something.

335
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,280
I do have IBS, just not that IBS.

336
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Irritable, bouncy boobies syndrome.

337
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Okay, so this is a good question.

338
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Any children you have with your fans will be very beautiful,

339
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,280
but they'll be really really dumb.

340
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,280
So if you, your senpais, how to, you know, chat with your senpais,

341
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
they just be really dumb ass child, but they're...

342
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,280
I'm pressing the button because I'm kinda already dumb, so it's like...

343
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
It's already gonna happen.

344
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:43,280
I'm pressing the button, as long as I'm kind.

345
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,280
As long as I'm found as kind and thoughtful,

346
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,280
as a little stupidity, it's okay.

347
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Hopefully they're not, like, the one character from the one book

348
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,280
that accidentally kills things because she's really dumb.

349
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
She's like Rape's a wrap, I don't know.

350
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
Same author, forget it.

351
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,280
Yeah, I hit the button.

352
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
I look not at the button.

353
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:12,240
who's the one pushing it out huh seven eight percent said they wouldn't push the button yeah no

354
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:22,080
i think stupidity can can be fixed okay i could be a fan basis i don't know i could be fixed yay

355
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:32,720
there's a cure for us there's a hope for me well this is a great question uh you find out vampires are real

356
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,160
and you can become one live forever and use your vampire powers to stop i don't know why it so

357
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:46,560

someone asks uh wait is there a do you have one in your chat

425
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:06,240

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,480
so we can answer too yeah so it has a question for mercy if you

427
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,360

430
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,360

431
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:46,080
oh someone said who do you think is the most degen of the four of us degen straw um i think a

432
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,640
lot of us hide our power will level from each other

433
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,280
they say out of the i think i say out of the four of us out of the four of us the four of us

434
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,480
out of the four of us might be in me

435
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,560
if i was in another form i might uh i think it's in me match in me's degen this but

436
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,760
i think it's in me i gotta keep it classy being being mad at him you know

437
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,000

441
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,160

442
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,240
how much do you drink i i feel like a drink three three to four bottles of soju

443
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,800
of soju i don't so i'll have like one bottle of soju and halfway through it i'm already gone

444
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:03,360
i don't know how much i drink but if i want to have fun i'll have like a whole bottle of baileys

445
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240

447
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,760

448
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,800

someone said who could squirt the farthest

451
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,000

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,200
emi

453
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:54,080
i probably see all of the girls is like abilities you know i don't know i can i can when i'm trying

and i'm like in the shower i feel like i could piss pretty far if i like the force when wait was

455

457
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:19,840

459
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:36,960
in less than like two seconds and probably out of everyone i go to idle meetings the most

what's the favorite audio you've recorded so far

867
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:20,720
i liked my armpit audio the most because i feel like i'm not really good

868
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:26,720
at acting subby i feel like my audio is where i act more dominant i feel more comfortable

869
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:32,560
so that's my favorite one where you fucking lick the sweat off of my armpit while you're jork in it

01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,840
