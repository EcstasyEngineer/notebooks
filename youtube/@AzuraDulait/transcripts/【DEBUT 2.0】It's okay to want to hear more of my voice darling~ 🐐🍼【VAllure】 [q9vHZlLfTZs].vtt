You

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You

02:16.040 --> 02:18.040
Hi

02:19.840 --> 02:21.840
Hi

02:26.320 --> 02:28.320
Hi

02:30.000 --> 02:32.880
Can you hear me? Can you hear me, okay?

02:34.040 --> 02:37.920
My mic's not being like extremely bad this time

02:49.880 --> 02:51.880
Not so good. I'm so happy

02:53.880 --> 02:56.880
B&U kinda loud, I heard that I got you

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
What's up? Welcome in everyone from from M.A.S.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
M.A.S. Dream. Have you all enjoyed M.A.S. Dream?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Hello hello

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
I can do louder

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Okay

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Yay! Am I right? Am I right?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Hi, welcome in everyone

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
And it was Nia's

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
What are you guys there for?

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Stronius and Shavius and IcyStream too?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I hope you are

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Thank you

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
My mic sounds better now, yay!

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I'm so happy, I'm glad

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I made a mistake

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
It was like a big mistake last time

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I'm so sorry

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
I swear to you, I was checking

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
All my audio

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
I was checking my audio yesterday before that

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
The day before that

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
And just before I went live

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
And then all of a sudden

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
It was bad, it was so bad

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
I was so loud

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Beating in your ear

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I'm so happy, it sounds so much better

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Music is loud, my queen

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
What? I just turned it down

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Okay, I got you, I'll turn it down some more

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Cheers

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Is that good?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Is it better?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
I pray

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Power of God

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Good, good

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
And

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
I know it's impossible to stream without scuff

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
It happens, it comes

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
It comes and it goes

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
You have another choice

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
What to do?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Get through it

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
It's like the voice

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I'm mercy

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I'm mercy

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I'm chibi

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I'm mercy chibi

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I'm so like

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
My throat is so dry

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I feel sick

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
It's cold

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
It's nice and cold

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Much better

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
My throat is almost better

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Yeah, I'm hydrating with milk

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Nice fresh milk

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Yeah

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I wouldn't be surprised

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
if there are some of you already falling asleep

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
If you find my voice super

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
You know

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Relaxing to that point

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
of falling asleep

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
I understand

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Come closer to the mic

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Actually, I think I'll turn it up a little bit

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Cause I did turn it down

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
quite a bit

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
So scared that I'd be too loud

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Hang on, whoop, I made a mistake

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Uh

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Is this better?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Let me know

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Is this good?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Can you hear me?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Sounds good

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Yes

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Good audio?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Sounds good

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Better

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
I heard solution

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Silly

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
I love this

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
There we go

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
What, alright

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
We'll get this down

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
We'll get this down

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Trust, we'll get this down

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
And we won't have to worry about this cup anymore

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Well

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Here's eventually

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Are you nervous?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Me?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Maybe

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Maybe

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Maybe a little bit

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Maybe a little bit

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I'm a little nervous

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I'm a big brave

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I'm a big brave woman, alright

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
A lot of big brave women

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Alright, okay

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
I was just setting everything up

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
And I thought we'd just, you know, relax

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
And chill and talk about

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
The day veiled in some of my interests

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
And stuff that

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
I went over

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
I didn't really get to list everything

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
That I had on there

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Sadly, because I thought that

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
It would just be better just to list like ten things

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Five things

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
And not like crowded with so much stuff

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
So

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I had

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Just a few things

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
And I do want to go over some of the entrusts

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Especially anime choices

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
And some really big game choices

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
And stuff, and some more stuff I want to talk about

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
So if you guys have any questions for me

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
I'll be happy to

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Go over some questions that you have for me

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
I also want to go over some morals

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
And talk about

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Some things that just came out

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Today

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Yay

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Blessed with the legendary voice

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
I heard a lot of people tell me that

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
She can't keep up that voice

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
It's impossible

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
I want to say that this is

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
This is actually my voice

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
So I don't know

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
I have quite a range

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
In my voice

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
So I can change the voice

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
But this is my natural voice

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
So yeah

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Can you do impressions too?

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
There is one impression that I think I can't do

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
But I don't want to

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Because I don't have confidence in it

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
But I used to do a really good Cartman voice

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
For self perk

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I can't hear it

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I'm like so nervous

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I'm kind of messing up with a bunch of it

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I'm so scared

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
It's that

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
It's the Cartman voice

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
It's the Cartman voice

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
It's the Cartman voice

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
It's the Cartman voice

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
It's the Cartman voice

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
It's that

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
It's the Cartman voice

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
And the goofy voice that I can do

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
It's like the only impressions that I ever did

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
When I get really excited or bored

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
Or having fun or playing games and stuff

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
I'll probably do them randomly out of the blue

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
It's like a... how do you call it?

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Stimulize? Stimulation?

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
People do random sounds and noises

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Every now and then

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
You'll probably hear me do it out of the blue

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Cartman voice line and goofy teaser please

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Yes gamer, I get my girl

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
This is true

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Cartman ASMR win

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Oh my god

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
That's hilarious

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
That sounds like fun

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
I get me and ASMR, I would love to do that

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I probably wouldn't be able to get through it

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I'd laugh the entire time

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
I wouldn't be able to stop laughing

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
I can't even imagine doing a goofy ASMR

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Oh god, that sounds amazing

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
That sounds so awesome

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
You?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
I can't do it

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I can't do it

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
My body just won't let me

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I can't do it

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Oh my god

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Oh man, okay

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
I have like bad like

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
I have like ADHD right?

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
I would weekend end up sitting here talking for like

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
For hours

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
And I'd forget everything else that I'm supposed to be doing

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
So let's make sure we stay on track

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Okay

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Chatting is the best thing

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
It is, I enjoy it a lot

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
I still want to get through a lot of stuff

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
I don't want to get too distracted

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
But I do like talking to you guys a lot

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Like seeing what you guys have to say

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
And your questions

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
And you guys get to know me as me

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
I am still Azura, but yeah

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
Professional Yapper, yeah

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Totally professional

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
I'm sorry I needed more water

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
You know when you talk a lot

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
You gotta drink a lot of water

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
A lot, a lot, a lot of water

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Don't stop water

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Okay

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
I want you to do this

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
And

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Okay, hang on

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
Plop, plop, plop, plop, plop, plop, plop

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
What do I click?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Where are we?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
I still just see him

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I did it

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I figured it out

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Oh no, that's not supposed to be on screen yet

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Oh no

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Oh no

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
That's fine, that's pretend

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
That everything is fine

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Everything is perfectly fine

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Just like this

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
This is how it's supposed to have been

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Just like this

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
It was like this from the start

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Ever from the start

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
That's right, you saw nothing

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
You saw nothing

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Only mommy

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Only me, you only saw me

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
No one else

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Nothing else

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Okay

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Alright

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I'm on it

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
I worried so like

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I was like

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
When I set up these slides

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I swear

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I thought it was super fun

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
I was looking up these collars

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
To look like a little milk

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Like animation

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
I wanted this little animation to be like

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Milk

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
So I didn't know

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
How to like

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Do it

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
So I did the little waves

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
And I like searched it up

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Like how to do the waves

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
I'm not really good with the technical stuff

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
When it comes to these kind of things

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
But I really don't

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I really do like looking into it

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
And so I was like

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
I want milk

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I want it to be on the background

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
So I thought it was like really cool

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Okay

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
So I thought that was Zura

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
I just wanted to add that

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
So I did want to go over

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
My interest

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
My interest

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
And I mentioned

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
That I watch a lot of anime

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
But

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
When I said a lot of anime

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
And I said a thousand anime

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I really meant it

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Like I've actually

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
When I was younger

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
I used to

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Make a list

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Like I would

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
I had a book

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
I still have it

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
I had a book

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Like a notebook

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Where I wrote down

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Every anime I finished

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I would write down

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
Every anime I finished

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
And I got up to

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
A thousand seven hundred

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
And then I

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
I just stopped

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Writing down anime

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
After that

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
So the threshold

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Of how much anime

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
I've watched in between there

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
And then and there

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Was

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Probably in like

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Two thousand four hundred now

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Does Azul like

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Overlord?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Yes!

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
I've watched Overlord

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Do I like Re Zero?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Yes! I've watched Re Zero

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
I

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Thoughts on

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Reincarnation

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
To the slime season

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I'm actually

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Kind of a little bit

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Disappointed

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
In the

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
The new season

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Because

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
It was like

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
They spent like

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Six episodes

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I'm over exaggerating

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
They spent so many episodes just talking

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Talking

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Talking

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Talking

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
And I'm up to date

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
So you have to wait a week

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
For the next episode

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Only for them to

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Talk more

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Talk more

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Talk more

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Then they're like

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Oh there's going to be a fight

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
In the next episode

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
More talking

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
More talking

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
More talking

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
They spent

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Those episodes

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Literally at the same table

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
The same table

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
The same scene

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
All they did was switch seats

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
All they did was switch seats

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
And then when the

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Big scene came

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
I won't spoil it

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
For anyone who's watching

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Won't spoil it

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Then when the big scene came

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
The big big major scene

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Where you know

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
The big stuff was going to happen

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Literally they

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
They like separate it and was like

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Yeah let's

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Me and you pair up

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Yeah how about we go over here

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
How about we go over here

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Then they don't even show it

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
They don't even show the fight

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
They don't even show it

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
We don't even get to see

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Each character fight

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Yeah I was disappointed

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
I was disappointed

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Animation's still good

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
But I was very disappointed

22:59.000 --> 23:04.000
I finally

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Kept up

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
What other animals

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Yes I've watched TVZ

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
I've watched the big threes

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
I've watched the big fives

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
I've watched all the big ones

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Really famous ones

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
100%

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
I'm a big Naruto fan

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
I've watched it

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
For the whole 15 years

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Of Naruto

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
So I'm a huge Naruto fan

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I have all the games

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
I've had all the games

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Someone stole two of my games

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
But we won't

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
We'll talk about that

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
I am not a fan of

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Naruto

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
I'm sorry

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
I know a lot of people like

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Naruto

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
But I'm not a fan of

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Naruto

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
I don't like

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
I don't like that child

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Though I still watch it

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Because I'm still a fan

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Of the series itself

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
I have to watch it

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I cannot not watch it

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
I have to watch it

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Naruto made me angry

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
It's like

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
I've been with Naruto

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
For so long

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
That I understand

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
His pain

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
What he had to do

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
To get to where he was

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
And he doesn't understand

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
The concept of being a parent

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
And I understand

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Naruto

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Needing a parent by him

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
But

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
And I understand he's still a kid

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
And he can't understand

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
This concept

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Of what Naruto went through

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
But they're hiding it from him

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
And it made it a little worse

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Like just tell the kid

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Tell him

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Tell him

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Tell him what happened

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Tell him

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
So that he could finally understand

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
And mature

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
And stop being a brat

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
It's such a brat

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Well of course

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
My favorite character

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Is Hinata

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Sorry

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
It's my boo-dang

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
I love Hinata

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
It's Hinata and Rock Lee

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
I really like Rock Lee

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Like come on

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
A character that worked

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Really really hard

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
To get where he is

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
And to be

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
At the top of where everyone is

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Like come on

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
It's Rock Lee

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
And guys and Zebra

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
I like them

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Oh man

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
You guys have so much less

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Of a

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
More anime

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
More questions

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
But other anime

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
I'm trying to keep up

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I'm so not used to

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
This chat movement so fast

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
I

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Yeah

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Rock Lee vs. Gar was the best fight

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Whenever

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Little

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
It was a great fight

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Hype was crazy

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
Uncle bad

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Get very cute

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
I like Uncle too

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
I

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Had to raise Zebra

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
I know you're pissed

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
I watched so many more anime

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
I watched Yu Yu Hakusho

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I watched all the old old anime

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Dang

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
I watched Inuyasha

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I think Inuyasha was like

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
What

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Like really got me into anime

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
A long time ago

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Since

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Way back when

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I used to be a poor poor child

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
I still am

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Didn't have a TV

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Didn't have anything

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
So

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
When I went to go visit

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Family

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
I would stay over

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
And they had a TV

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
And it would stay on all night

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
And I would sleep

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
And watching cartoons

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Cartoons

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
And

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
You fall asleep

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
And in the middle of the night

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
You know

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
The ending would play

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
And

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
And it would wake me up

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
And then I would sit there

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
And I would watch it

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Like

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
And then I'd end up watching

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
You Know Yasha

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
And then after that

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
I really got into watching

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
You Know Yasha

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
And then I started watching

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
More anime

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
And more

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
I was watching

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
The Big O

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Cowboy Bebop

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
All of this came on

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
On Adult Swem

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I was watching all of these

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
On the TV

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
I definitely shouldn't

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Have been watching these things

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Given how old I was then

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
But I was watching all of them

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
I remember

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
When I first watched

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Caster & Sins

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
It was a

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Thanksgiving day

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
And

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
They turned on the TV

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
To keep the

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Kitties distracted

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
And

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
They knew I liked anime

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
But they didn't know

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
What anime was really about

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
So they just turned it on

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
The TV

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
And Caster & Sins

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Like a marathon was running

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
And I watched the whole thing

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
While I was sitting there

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
On the floor

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Like

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Wah

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Wah

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
That's crazy

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
It's like a

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Whole marathon

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Are you watching the new

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Spice & Wolf?

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
It's on my

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
To watch list

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
I really enjoyed

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
The first

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Spice & Wolf

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
The original

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Before they did the remake

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
I really

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
I watched the whole thing

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
And I know the whole song

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Seven apples on a

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Witch's tree

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
With seven seas

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
A plant inside of me

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
And springtime

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
I sing

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
A magic song

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Then skipping along

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
I sing

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
A song to everyone

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
I look at the world

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Through

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Apple eyes

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
I cut myself a slice

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Of sunshine pie

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
I know that whole song

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
So I have it on my

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
To watch list

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
I was waiting

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
For all the episodes

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
To come out

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
So it's on my list

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
To watch the

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
New Spice & Wolf

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Any guilty pleasure

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Animated

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Ease

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Like

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
An anime that's trash

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
But you can't get enough

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
None that I could

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Think of

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
I don't think

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
I could think

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Of one right now

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
I know a

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Bunch of anime

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
That has

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Like really bad animation

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
But the plot

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Is so funny

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
So I still like it

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Or like

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
It's chaotic

30:33.000 --> 30:38.640
like childish anime that I really like it was an anime that I used to watch when I

30:38.640 --> 30:45.420
was younger called Kadocha Kadocha was like a little girl named like was it

30:45.420 --> 30:52.740
Sonako? Sonako? She would sing into this toy.

30:56.420 --> 31:06.360
Super old anime so old no one knows of it but it was so funny to me it was

31:06.360 --> 31:10.060
hilarious to me I found it very funny a lot of people would probably watch it

31:10.060 --> 31:15.220
now I'd be like what the hell sounds horrible this looks terrible

31:24.540 --> 31:31.180
I do like Belle's above 100% it's a good it's a good anime I really love

31:31.500 --> 31:37.900
anime is that um that have delinquents in it I love delinquency

31:37.900 --> 31:46.660
delinquency anime is so good I just love their voice

31:46.660 --> 31:55.020
I just like the way they talk and the way they yell at each other it's my

31:55.020 --> 31:58.260
favorite so one or there is a delinquent in an anime they're like usually my

31:58.260 --> 32:13.420
favorite favorite characters and yes I watched I shield 21 as well I really

32:13.420 --> 32:17.700
like sports anime as well so I put blue lock because it was like one of the

32:17.700 --> 32:24.300
newest like recent ones that I've watched and I like I like when they're

32:24.300 --> 32:29.020
really suspenseful and I think blue lock really hit that like I've been

32:29.020 --> 32:34.500
craving a sports anime with really good animation that is really suspenseful for

32:34.500 --> 32:38.740
a while and then with blue lock came out it was like that was that was it that

32:38.740 --> 32:45.460
was the one it was really hype it had me really into it and I've watched a

32:45.460 --> 32:50.460
haikyo I've watched I've watched and read the manga of Prince of Tennis

32:50.460 --> 32:55.500
because I've read the manga first before I watched the anime so I read the manga

32:55.500 --> 33:09.420
I read Prince of Tennis I free haikyo I liked haikyo a lot I liked a lot of a

33:09.420 --> 33:17.700
lot of the anime is any opinion on the JoJo series I watched the whole JoJo

33:17.700 --> 33:32.100
series I've seen the whole thing all of it I love that I just people there's a

33:32.100 --> 33:41.780
what's that sumo anime called haji haji haji something sumo I don't know sumo I

33:42.100 --> 33:48.140
watch that too I really love the opening of that song a lot it's one of my

33:48.140 --> 33:57.060
favorite openings he know he mode he no matter sumo yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

33:57.060 --> 34:03.180
yeah yeah the opening is so awesome I love it it's a really good opening I

34:03.180 --> 34:10.540
didn't expect it and I think the opening is what really made me continue to watch

34:10.540 --> 34:17.900
the anime have you seen our bleach I haven't seen the new bleach stuff that

34:17.900 --> 34:25.660
came out because I don't like cliffhangers so I was waiting for a majority of

34:25.660 --> 34:29.380
episodes to come out cuz I like to bench sit down with some ice cream some

34:29.380 --> 34:38.580
popcorn turn off my lights good comfy cozy wrapping up like it and then bench

34:38.620 --> 34:47.420
big old bench I haven't seen the new bleach yet but I stopped at the the old

34:47.420 --> 34:54.020
old bleach I seen the whole season like can you get a big hug yeah you can get a

34:54.020 --> 35:01.460
big hug a big hug there you go yeah hug for a job

35:08.180 --> 35:13.980
binging is the best favorite bleach opening oh that's hard that's very hard

35:13.980 --> 35:17.980
because I listened to like a bunch of openings and I think all of them are

35:17.980 --> 35:31.060
really good I don't know that one stuck in my head so that one gets easily stuck

35:31.060 --> 35:37.980
in my head so probably that one I think it's opening six if I remember correctly

35:47.980 --> 35:57.860
yeah I think that's opening sex

35:57.860 --> 36:10.620
NASA loans now I'm stuck in my head it gets stuck in my head really like fast

36:11.340 --> 36:25.060
do you watch harem anime I do but I am not like a mega big fan of certain harem

36:25.060 --> 36:32.220
anime because I'm not a fan of certain MC characters that are like like

36:32.220 --> 36:39.060
extremely dumb they make me really mad

36:39.180 --> 36:44.700
it makes me super mad with how dense they could be like how can you be so

36:44.700 --> 36:53.060
dense how how how are you stop it are you dumb

36:53.060 --> 36:59.540
who's right with you she wants you

36:59.540 --> 37:15.300
I watched it is only certain harem anime that really catch my attention and I

37:15.300 --> 37:20.500
guess it's I guess it's where the MC sometimes really don't want anything to

37:20.500 --> 37:27.780
do with the other girls and they don't get beat up I like where the girls

37:27.780 --> 37:33.820
aren't that cliche niche where they like beat up the MC all the time for like

37:33.820 --> 37:46.020
small things like really small things like why are you beating him up why why I

37:46.020 --> 37:52.620
thought his joke was really funny I thought it was funny I laughed

37:57.780 --> 38:01.260
he didn't do nothing wrong

38:05.700 --> 38:10.420
especially if you really like the character like if she the character

38:10.420 --> 38:16.900
right really likes the MC and he happened to see something right and he

38:16.900 --> 38:22.420
actually generally felt bad about it why hit him there's no need to hit him

38:22.420 --> 38:26.060
it'll be different if he was like one of those characters to really really really

38:26.420 --> 38:41.580
really really poorly what and they did that you know the extreme I would get it

38:41.580 --> 39:00.660
I would get one in you know beat them up all right but so Cassie yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

39:00.920 --> 39:03.640
yeah

39:07.540 --> 39:12.820
we're them up deserved

39:16.340 --> 39:23.320
guy probably not dense because I keep hitting him in the head

39:24.560 --> 39:28.700
its probably true

39:30.660 --> 39:43.020
I've seen Beyblade X. I don't have a big opinion on it actually. I've seen it so long ago

39:43.020 --> 39:47.900
that I don't really have it. I can't really give an opinion on like extremely extremely

39:47.900 --> 39:54.700
old anime or shows or cartoons because they're really old. That's like asking me what are

39:54.700 --> 39:59.900
my opinions on Pokemon and I've watched the entire Pokemon series. I'm a huge Pokemon

39:59.900 --> 40:08.500
fan. I've played almost a majority of all Pokemon games. I love Pokemon. Do I have an

40:08.500 --> 40:13.260
opinion on the show itself? No. I don't. I don't. I can't give you that. I can't give

40:13.260 --> 40:26.660
you that answer. I love Pokemon. That's all that matters. I even have a Digimon plushie

40:26.660 --> 40:36.660
sitting up there. But Digimon plushie, Pikachu plushie, a bunch of plushies. I collect quite

40:36.660 --> 40:47.620
a lot of them. Oh my god someone mentioned Negima. Oh my god I really loved Negima. I

40:47.620 --> 40:55.740
don't know why. But I loved Negima. It gets a pass. A big pass for me. He was an intelligent

40:55.740 --> 41:01.260
character. He was really smart. He may be a little bit dense but he was smart. I liked

41:01.260 --> 41:13.860
him. I liked Negima. That was good anime. Singles for that Yokai anime. What was it called?

41:13.860 --> 41:29.180
It's not really a harem. I wouldn't really call it a harem anime. What was it called?

41:29.180 --> 41:39.620
It's like the Yokai anime where he turns into the guy with the really long hair. The white

41:39.620 --> 41:58.580
hair that comes out really long in the back. Yeah. Yes! That's the one. That's the one.

41:58.580 --> 42:22.500
Oh my god I can't even say that. I can't even say that. I'm gonna butcher it. I can't

42:22.500 --> 42:33.740
for that stuff. Look I said I'm still learning Japanese. The big words like that's hard. It

42:33.740 --> 42:51.140
is norari. I like that one. That's good. I sure people mentioned some more anime but

42:51.140 --> 43:00.740
I probably missed it. I'm sorry if I missed it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've seen a few

43:00.740 --> 43:24.500
other anime. We've been talking about anime for almost literally an hour. Oh no. No tarem.

43:25.140 --> 43:38.180
We have the hardest role. Yes I've seen Shaman King. I can tell you my favorite cartoons

43:38.180 --> 43:51.180
or anime from Four Kids TV. I watched Yu-Gi-Oh! Pokemon. Spider Writers. I watched Bakugan

43:51.180 --> 44:09.780
and Battle Brawlers. I watched all of them. Everything. I literally went on when I first

44:09.780 --> 44:20.940
got my big chunky PC. I was like binging all the shows that I could get my hands on. With

44:20.940 --> 44:27.340
the Wicked Rise, The World Girl, Howling Hall, Spider Writers. Spider Writers V2. If you

44:27.340 --> 44:33.180
truly want to be V2, it's cool. You can join our team. I know all the songs too.

44:33.180 --> 45:02.620
Oh, I like my favorite song. I like the original Yu-Gi-Oh! But there's not a lot of singing. It's

45:02.620 --> 45:13.020
just. But I think Five D's was my favorite. Yu-Gi-Oh! Five D's.

45:32.620 --> 45:39.820
Feel the wind is blowing me around. Take a shot at me and run this side by side. It's

45:39.820 --> 45:49.180
a blur as I go by. I can't hear you breathing. I can't see you coming. I can't feel the wind

45:49.180 --> 46:01.100
is blowing me around. See the sunrise and fire in the sky. Greatness thrust itself into our lives.

46:03.580 --> 46:04.220
Yeah.

46:12.460 --> 46:21.180
I loved Yu-Gi-Oh! Five D's. It was good. And the show called Blue Dragon. Blue Dragon, yeah.

46:21.900 --> 46:27.020
It looks like, I think the artist is literally the creator of Dragon Ball Z because they look the

46:27.180 --> 46:34.620
same. They look exactly the same. I've watched Detective Conan. Yes, yes, yes. Isn't Detective

46:34.620 --> 46:40.380
Conan still ongoing? I've watched like a few seasons but I don't think I've continued to watch it

46:40.380 --> 46:45.020
because there was so much. It's like one piece and I'm like also watching one piece as well.

46:45.020 --> 46:56.060
It's like the Conan is still kicking.

47:01.180 --> 47:07.820
Blue Dragon game was kind of ass. It's true. I agree. But the series was pretty good. And then it

47:07.820 --> 47:12.780
just kind of died. I don't know what happened to it. I don't know if it got cancelled or something.

47:12.780 --> 47:17.180
It just was gone. The show Akira, I watched that too.

47:21.580 --> 47:23.740
Goddess of Anime and Fertility.

47:29.580 --> 47:38.380
Any genre I dislike? Probably Mecha. I'm sorry everyone. I'm sorry. There's only a few Mecha

47:38.380 --> 47:47.260
that are in my heart early. But any other Mecha besides Neon Genesis, besides Full Metal Panic,

47:47.820 --> 47:50.700
Code Geass. If it's not those animes, I don't like it.

47:55.660 --> 48:02.700
I love Code Geass. I love Full Metal Panic and I love Neon Genesis. And was it, was the other one?

48:03.500 --> 48:08.220
There was another Mecha anime that I like but I don't remember the name of.

48:10.380 --> 48:17.420
Even Gallant. Yes, yes, yes. I like that too. No worries. No worries there. If it's not those,

48:17.420 --> 48:20.620
if it's like those other Mecha anime, I'm not really a big fan.

48:22.300 --> 48:31.900
Oh, I love Fuli Kuli. I love Fuli Kuli. Fuli Kuli is awesome. What? It's not even like a big Mecha anime.

48:32.780 --> 48:39.580
I like Goren Lagin but I really hate one of the characters.

48:42.140 --> 48:47.420
One of the female characters made me angry so she makes me not like the show.

48:49.820 --> 48:56.940
Eruka 7? I like Eruka 7. Like I said, there's only a few Mecha anime that win my heart over.

48:57.900 --> 49:01.180
Only a few. Majority of the new ones I don't really like.

49:11.980 --> 49:18.940
Yes, I watched Sparx Family. I really like the first season so I haven't really, I started

49:18.940 --> 49:26.460
on the next season but I haven't gone up to date so I like watched three episodes of the new season

49:26.460 --> 49:33.660
and then I kind of stopped. Their approach on the new season kind of like got me a little bored

49:34.300 --> 49:39.500
because they're like individually going at every character, giving each character their own episode.

49:40.380 --> 49:45.260
They didn't really do that in the first season so it kind of throws me off a little bit because I don't

49:46.300 --> 49:51.980
really like, usually it was a combination of everyone and then focused on Anya and now it's

49:52.460 --> 49:56.300
everyone gets their own special episode and I kind of like don't care.

50:01.900 --> 50:06.300
I don't know if that's just me not being able to process it very well but

50:07.900 --> 50:12.940
have you seen To Your Internity? To Your Internity is the first anime to ever make me cry

50:12.940 --> 50:17.900
in the first episode. The first anime to ever make me cry in the first episode.

50:18.860 --> 50:31.900
I love Death Note, of course I do. Oh my god, I love Durarara. I love Durarara as well.

50:31.900 --> 50:37.820
We're gonna sit here and talk about anime this entire time. There's so much stuff I wanted to talk about.

50:38.300 --> 50:50.140
I'm having fun. This is fun. Talking about anime gives you like really relaxed,

50:50.140 --> 50:56.140
really into it and it's like one of my biggest passions because when I'm really sad and feeling

50:56.140 --> 51:05.340
down and you know, I want to watch anime. It makes me feel so much better.

51:06.300 --> 51:12.060
So I like binged anime like throughout my whole life. Anime is great.

51:12.780 --> 51:29.740
Free Wren. Free Wren is, I finished that whole, I think that anime was amazing.

51:29.740 --> 51:36.060
There are a lot of hate on Free Wren. There's so much hate on that anime because it's like,

51:36.940 --> 51:45.020
it seems boring to the eyes of a lot of people. It doesn't meet the target audience,

51:45.740 --> 51:56.300
but I think it's so good. It tackles a whole another view on adventure as a whole.

51:58.460 --> 52:04.540
All anime is always focused, fantasy focus is always on the focus of what happens before.

52:05.340 --> 52:10.940
They defeat the demon lord, what happens before, everything they have to do and go through and

52:10.940 --> 52:19.020
you build this like towards the character in the moment. But imagine being someone who lives

52:19.020 --> 52:29.180
for a long time and being surrounded by people who don't and you spent an entire time living

52:29.260 --> 52:34.460
up with these people throughout your whole life and then they're gone.

52:35.180 --> 52:41.340
And now you have this, now it's like usually, anime would end on that and be like, oh that was the

52:41.340 --> 52:46.060
story of how we defeated the demon lord and then we'll never see what happens afterwards. We get

52:46.060 --> 52:54.460
to see the after, the memories and still gain a connection to old characters that you don't see

52:54.460 --> 53:00.700
later on and I think that's really awesome. And then the animation is amazing given the fact

53:00.700 --> 53:09.580
that it was drawn by hand. Everything was drawn by hand. It is amazing. They did so good for,

53:09.580 --> 53:15.740
especially for a studio that was, you know, a lot of their stuff in the past was really bad.

53:16.940 --> 53:22.940
They stepped it up. They stepped it up with this anime. Oh sorry, I got really into that one. I'm so sorry.

53:25.180 --> 53:38.380
I'm sorry, I got really passionate with that one.

53:45.180 --> 53:49.420
Oh yes, I watched Assassination Classroom. I think it's a really good anime as well.

53:55.180 --> 54:16.060
I feel so bad for the the elf though, for Friren. Given the fact that she is, you know,

54:16.060 --> 54:21.900
an elf and living for a long time, you don't really process the feelings of how humans process them.

54:22.700 --> 54:29.980
So I understand that. I really do understand that of being so out of touch with their own emotion

54:29.980 --> 54:40.860
sometimes and not understanding the concept of love and other feelings of, you know, things like

54:40.860 --> 54:45.420
that because, you know, when you say I'll see you later for an elf, that could be like, I'll see you

54:45.420 --> 54:54.300
later, like a hundred years later, like imagine someone liking you and you're like, and it's

54:54.300 --> 55:03.420
whatever. And then they like, then they're gone and then you're like, well, damn, well, damn.

55:04.540 --> 55:09.660
Now you know, you know, you cry, you cry. All you could do is cry and you feel for her like, oh,

55:10.620 --> 55:14.700
it took her so long to realize this and understand.

55:18.460 --> 55:26.380
Make me cry. I'm really emotional when it comes to watching anime. Anime does not fail to make

55:26.380 --> 55:30.620
me cry. If it's like really an emotional part or piece, I will probably cry.

55:30.620 --> 55:37.500
Pixel games? Yeah, I like pixel games, like, you know, like One Shot,

55:38.700 --> 55:47.260
Stardew Valley, you know, games like that. I like those kind of games, but I didn't really know

55:47.260 --> 55:54.140
how to like pinpoint it, like Terraria. I call those pixel games because I don't know what else to

55:54.140 --> 56:00.140
call them though. I call those pixel games. I don't know what else to call them though.

56:01.580 --> 56:07.500
Yeah, I like Cal World. I like open world games and building games. I like farming games. I like

56:07.500 --> 56:15.820
simulating games. I like games where you just shut your brain off and play. I love it. I do, do, do.

56:16.380 --> 56:25.820
Let me do a Monster Hunter stream. I want to, I'm a little nervous too, because it's not a game that I

56:27.180 --> 56:34.140
play often, but I have played it a few times and I loved it, but I never found the time to play it

56:34.140 --> 56:41.500
again. So I played it a few times, so it became one of my favorite games to play every now and then.

56:41.820 --> 56:48.940
Um, do I like the game Dead by Daylight? I have played it once when it was free to play,

56:50.620 --> 56:57.660
but I've never actually played it, but I have watched some gameplay because I did like the game

56:57.660 --> 57:15.020
itself. It looks fun, but yeah. I really do like One Shot a lot because I think it's super cute.

57:16.300 --> 57:25.660
I liked it so much so that I ended up getting a Nico, a Nico plushie. I have a Nico plushie,

57:26.540 --> 57:30.460
and the light bulb is like magnet and it like attaches to his hands.

57:37.900 --> 57:43.900
That's one of my favorite games. I really like that. So I can't wait to play it again. I'm so

57:43.900 --> 57:49.980
excited to play it once more. Yeah, I mean, or for the first time ever. Yeah.

57:55.900 --> 58:09.500
I actually added a few games that I haven't played. No, I haven't actually, I'm reading this list.

58:11.580 --> 58:19.260
There's only one game I haven't played and that's Little Nightmares. I have the game and I've had

58:19.260 --> 58:25.980
the game in my library for a really, really long time, for a really, really, really long time,

58:27.340 --> 58:32.460
but I've never played it. So it's been a game that I've been wanting to play for a really long time.

58:32.460 --> 58:34.860
This is there.

58:40.940 --> 58:45.260
Yeah, I hear it's short, but I want to play the whole series, Little Nightmares.

58:45.260 --> 58:54.300
One, two, and I don't think three is out yet. So that's why I want to play it.

58:59.820 --> 59:07.980
All right, fine. Fine. I've been seeing this question a lot. All right. Listen to me. Listen

59:07.980 --> 59:14.380
to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Are you guys listening? Are you listening? Are you listening?

59:15.020 --> 59:21.580
Can you hear me? Are you listening? Listen to me. Listen, listen, listen.

59:24.380 --> 59:35.020
I like it, all right? I like it. I like it. I like League of Legends. All right? All right? All right?

59:37.500 --> 59:39.820
I like League of Legends.

59:44.380 --> 01:00:10.940
Look, look, look, look, look, look. I don't know why. Look, I don't know why.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:19.660
I don't know why. I do not recommend playing this game. Don't play it. It's a dictation.

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:29.740
But I played it for so long. I played it for so long. For so, so very long. All right? I can't help it.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:37.100
It's a good game for me. I don't listen. I don't, I don't really talk in the chat. I don't really

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:43.340
talk in the, in the game. I don't really, I just like to turn off my brain, play some good old norms,

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:51.660
go mid lane, and just farm, murder a person in a game.

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:59.660
And, and, and, you know, just chat, you know? It's like really, it's like,

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:06.300
it's like the, it's like a good chatting stream for me. I have ADHD and I like flashing colors,

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:14.060
okay? I like the flashing colors and the abilities. While I'm just literally staring at my screen,

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:31.820
all right? I've gotten so far in the game as in like, it's like, it's like a, it's like a

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:41.500
gotcha game, almost kind of like, similar. Yeah. I have so much stuff on it, on the account that I had

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:47.260
that I, I didn't want to stop playing. I collected so much stuff. I was like, I don't want to stop

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:55.260
playing. I got so much stuff, I could get more, more, I need more, more, please, more, please, more.

01:01:55.740 --> 01:02:05.980
Please, please. I almost have every champion, more champions, more, more.

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:12.620
We can fix her.

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:24.380
We're rolled to your man. I usually made mid. I usually made mid lane, but sometimes I go support.

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:32.140
But I made mid. My favorite champion that I like to play is Zyra.

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:37.500
She's a babe, bro. That's a very hot babe.

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.620
Something about her seeds being inside of you, some chat.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.660
Isn't that one of her lines?

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:56.780
Wait until my, wait as I plant my seeds inside of you.

01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:02.940
That's one of her voice lines. I swear. I swear.

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:05.980
I swear.

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:07.340
Wait.

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:19.340
I swear.

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.820
I could be a little bit thummy sometimes.

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:38.220
Hey, sometimes.

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:43.580
Only if you want me to be.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:49.260
Look, all right. I know some of you have sent me a lot of things asking if I was

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:55.980
so boredom and stuff like that, but I'm, I'm, I'm just, I'm weird.

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:04.620
You'll get what I give you and you'll love it regardless. So does it really matter?

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:10.300
You'll probably get a little bit of both. So, you know.

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:12.140
All right.

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.220
That's the first one. The answer is I swear to you.

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.580
Chat volume warning.

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:42.140
Okay. We've been on this slide for a while. We could always talk about more anime

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:47.020
and another like Zazzledon stream or something. It's a little just chatting stream.

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:59.980
So let's move on. I want to just go over some more things and stuff with you guys.

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:10.780
We, we spent over an hour on that. Maybe we could talk more about it another time.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:19.580
We have, we have more than enough time to talk about so many things, right?

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:21.900
So many, so many things.

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:26.140
But yes.

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:37.980
To say my name was anime talk true. All right. I'm about to keep thing up with time. So

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:47.740
it feels shorter. It really does. It feels like we just started.

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:53.260
I do want to say

01:05:53.580 --> 01:06:04.780
that these cookies have been staring at me this entire time and they're taunting me.

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:07.420
And I want to eat them. I want to eat them so bad.

01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:24.780
I want you to understand me. I want you to know that I do. I know a lot of people were like confused

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:35.100
about my, wait, was that, was it squishy, squishy, squishy, squishy? Are you a baker? Because I want to

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:49.740
grab your, bro, bro, bro.

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:54.700
Squishy why? Squishy why?

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:06.620
I thought it was like a genuine question.

01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:11.180
I got trolled.

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:26.300
Dang it. Papa's over here scaring, trolling me.

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:41.100
I believe there is a public discord server that gives you notifications when we go live and

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:48.060
stuff. But we are not in it. You will not find us in it. But I do recommend joining it if you

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:52.620
want updates for when everyone goes live. Especially me. Because I know you want to be

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:59.980
up to date whenever I'm here. I want everyone to see me, hear my voice, talk to me.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:04.140
Oh my god.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.020
I'm gone.

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:18.540
Oh my tootie crap.

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:35.820
I didn't go anywhere. I don't know what you're talking about. I was here the whole time.

01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.340
I was here the whole time.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:59.020
Oh, we're fine. Everything's fine. Everything's okay.

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:14.060
You're probably going to experience so much scuff and all my streams, extreme extreme scuff.

01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:21.020
We're fine. Everything's great.

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:40.220
All right. So yes, I am a baker. I bake stuff sometimes when I'm like feeling like in a really

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:45.500
mood to have sweets and I really want it. I make brownies, cupcakes, cakes.

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:52.140
I was learning how to make cheesecakes and all sorts of stuff. Grand crackers, cookies.

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:56.300
So many other stuff.

01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:07.660
So, however, these are things that I wanted to do on stream, like a handcam stream and stuff like

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:15.180
that. So I want to do these things. I want to cook for you guys and show you my cakes and stuff,

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:21.020
but I am very limited in being able to do that with my living situation.

01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:37.020
Yeah, I live with a pretty big family. So doing that won't be possible right away.

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:50.460
So when I'm able to move out, which I hope is soon, but I would have to save up quite a bit

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:58.940
before I could do that. I will be free to do a lot more things for streams and stuff like that.

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:04.060
That's so sudden.

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:14.780
I want to make threads and fake stuff.

01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:28.140
For now, I could just like show you like pictures and stuff on stream or on Twitter,

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:40.700
the Twitter, Twitter, or X, I mean, sorry, X, X, Xter, X sweeter. What do you call it?

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:44.620
Is it okay to say that here? Can I say that here?

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:50.460
I want to show you pictures and stuff, and I'll do that and stuff right now.

01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:03.820
I still call it Twitter.

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:16.300
I want, I think, Stronius spoke about this, about how there were some people wanting to make

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:21.660
cover songs. I think I was one of the girls that really, really, really, really, really,

01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:37.660
super one to make of our song. I want to sing for you guys. I want to sing for you guys.

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:50.780
I sing songs and stuff for you. I'm very subconscious of my voice when I speak normally. I'm really

01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:58.460
surprised you guys like my voice. I was really surprised when Stroni liked my voice. I was

01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:05.660
all very surprised. This is a very honest opinion of mine. A lot of people think my voice is fake

01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:11.980
or my voice is like I'm doing too much. There are people who would always tell me that I sound

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:19.660
like a child or a kid. Or I sound like a pupas and child and stuff like that. People tell me that

01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:25.980
all the time. But I've been very subconscious of my voice for a long time.

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:37.420
To me, I think my voice is horrible. But a lot of you really like my voice. So I'm happy. You do.

01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:49.500
I'm happy. I'm glad you like it. But I do have a list. So I pronounce a lot of words really

01:13:49.500 --> 01:14:01.340
badly. I have a really bad list. List. List. I swear the person who created that word is evil.

01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:07.340
They created that word knowing that people with one can't say it. They're evil. That's all I'll say.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:31.740
They're evil. So that's why I speak the way I speak. Because I have a list.

01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:36.460
So I'm sorry. I'm really sorry if my grammar is wack.

01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:48.700
Or we're getting off track.

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:16.700
I am

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:27.820
really new to the ASMR scene.

01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:37.180
I hope you don't mind. I'm a little new to ASMR scene.

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:49.180
So I hope you don't mind.

01:15:49.420 --> 01:16:02.380
Drunk. A lot of people say that. That I sound like that. That I'm drunk. Do I?

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:09.340
Really? Do I sound like I'm drunk? But you don't really want to know what it really sounds like

01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:30.620
when I get drunk. I don't know how a drunk person really sounds. But this is how I sound.

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:35.900
I don't know. It's very common. A lot of people say it. My family says the same thing to me.

01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:42.220
That I always sound like I'm drunk. So I don't know. I think it's just my speech. It's very slurrish.

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:48.940
It's very slurrish. And the combination of the list makes it a lot more worse.

01:16:54.700 --> 01:17:03.500
So yeah. I do have plans to do a drunk stream. But I want to also go over some things that

01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:12.140
I kind of have to deal with that. With the drinking part thing. So

01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:19.420
I do want to let everyone know that I am a little sickly.

01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:33.900
I've been sick since I was like really young. I've had a lot of issues going on with like

01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:45.340
my stomach. Intestinal issues. A lot of issues there. They found like a

01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:49.180
kind of like a mass. But not like a

01:17:51.340 --> 01:18:04.940
the the C word. Serous. The C word. Serous mass. It was found in my nose. My nasal cavity.

01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:11.980
And it infected a lot of tissue. And I had to get that surgically removed.

01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:21.340
So I have a lot of nasal issues. So that could also be why I sound kind of stuffy if I do to you.

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:28.940
But my nasal patches is pretty cleared up now after the surgery. So I'm good now.

01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:35.740
So every now and then you'll probably I'll have to probably like spray my nose.

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:41.180
Just in case I get really stuffy. And then I start sounding like this the entire time.

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:48.140
Like I'm Squidward. And we don't want that.

01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:02.940
So yeah.

01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:10.140
So we don't want that.

01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:31.340
I'm going miles per second. I click something I shouldn't have. All right, all right, we're fine.

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:48.700
And I'm not really green guys. I'm like I'm like a teal. I'm blue. All right. I look green.

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:59.740
But I'm blue. Don't let the colors fool you. The color spectrum is evil. All right. It's evil.

01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:02.780
I see green. Yeah, I'm blue. All right.

01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:16.620
I'm blue. And these are neck pillows. They are ears. They are my little gold ears. Okay. They're ears.

01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:20.860
Please, please. Thank you.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:35.980
That is all. Welcome back. Thank you for participating in my talk. Thank you.

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:36.700
Thank you.

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:51.980
But yes, I got a lot of physical issues with my shoulder.

01:20:53.980 --> 01:21:01.180
My shoulder didn't develop properly. My shoulder didn't develop properly. And it took them like

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:06.460
many years for them to figure this out. So they finally took x-ray after telling me that I was

01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:11.580
fine saying it was stress, stress, stress, stress, stress, stress. It's fine. It's fine. You're fine.

01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:17.820
You're fine. And then they finally took x-ray. I got a better doctor like this is my 10th 12th

01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:24.220
doctor that I went through. And they finally took x-ray. They seen that my shoulder is

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:33.260
didn't develop fully. So it causes pain in my right hand and in my elbow. And it travels

01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:38.780
through my whole arm. So I have extreme pain. So I'm on like a bunch of pain medication.

01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:47.180
So it makes me kind of loopy a little bit. So I'm just another reason why I probably sound like I'm

01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:59.580
drunk. I also have my spine at my neck is isn't curved like a sea like it's supposed to. It's

01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:07.500
actually straight. So I have permanent headaches that don't really go away. And I've had them

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:09.500
for a long time for years.

01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:21.260
So I got a, I have pink colors for that too.

01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:35.020
So yeah.

01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:37.020
This is where I'm going to be the second care of you.

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:48.780
No.

01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:59.660
I'm fine. Don't worry. I'm fine. I just want to be treated like everyone else.

01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:06.380
A lot of people I usually tell always end up feeling really bad for me. Don't feel bad for me.

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:13.260
I just want to live my life. I want to live a life. It was really hard enough for me to

01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:20.060
find work like outside of everything. People wouldn't hire me. And when they did hire me,

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:24.860
I was limited to doing stuff and they didn't like that. And I had to visit, I have to visit

01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:34.300
a doctor every week. I have doctor's appointments every week. So they were upset that I had to

01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:39.500
take time off every week. They didn't like that. They wanted me, they wanted all my time. So they

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:47.260
would always end up, you know, firing me. Whenever I got randomly sick on the job, they would get

01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:55.900
upset. Ambulance had to come pick me up one time because I got really, really badly sick.

01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:04.220
So I had stomach problems. So my stomach is very sensitive. If I eat certain food,

01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:10.300
I could get food poisoning pretty easy. It could be really bad.

01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:19.980
So I have a lot of issues. I don't mind talking about them. I really don't. I think I

01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:26.700
saw that in there. I can show you. I don't mind talking about them. I don't. However,

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:33.580
I would appreciate if people wouldn't ask too much questions on it though. I appreciate it.

01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:39.100
Please, please thank you. I just want to let you know now so that everyone knows and that if

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:43.420
anyone else asks, it's out there. The information is out there.

01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:50.300
Okay, yeah, yeah.

01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:51.020
Yeah.

01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:10.220
There's some other issues I have. But a lot of it just deals with my, I was kind of

01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:18.620
malnourished for a while. Yes, I'm a huge eater. I eat a lot and I used to, I have a really fast

01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:28.780
metabolism. So I would eat like nonstop. This was like a few years ago. I used to eat like

01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:36.860
three pizza pies, three whole pizza pies by myself. My metabolism is that fast. It was

01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:40.540
that fast. I think it's slowly slowing down. Maybe, I don't know, I don't think so.

01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:51.900
I eat a lot. So I'm a big foodie. I like food a lot.

01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:06.620
But because of this, because I eat a ton or not enough when I need to, because I can go like

01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:12.540
days without eating because I will forget. I feel like I like have this thing where I forget to eat.

01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:23.260
And I wouldn't eat for days and stuff like that. So and then I'll have a random binge day and I'd

01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:32.060
eat like a ton. So technically today, today I forgot to eat. Today, today I forgot to eat.

01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:35.260
I'll tell the ones I didn't eat today.

01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:47.260
I also forgot to eat yesterday.

01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:57.420
But my family made me something to eat yesterday after they built. Don't worry.

01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:03.900
Don't worry. Don't worry. I ate a little bit yesterday. It wasn't a lot, but I still ate a

01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:08.700
little bit yesterday. Like a plate. I ate like one plate of something.

01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:15.500
Don't tell everyone. No. Don't tell everyone. No. Don't tell.

01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:29.660
Eat silly. Oh, eat. Eat. Don't tell Stroney. Don't tell Stroney.

01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:39.260
But that's really just scold me. I'm getting in trouble. I'm getting in trouble.

01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:50.780
Let me eat the cookies. I have cookies. I have cookies. I'll eat this. I'll eat this.

01:27:51.580 --> 01:28:00.700
What the? Isn't this supposed to be like a a flap? Oh, you peel it like this.

01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:13.660
Cool. Okay. That's my acacia slice. I sat on them so I broke them. I accidentally sat on them.

01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:16.540
I forgot I put them in my in my in my chair.

01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:48.540
Free ASMR.

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:54.540
It should have been me. It's not fair.

01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:00.540
It should have been me.

01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:01.420
It should have been me.

01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:17.420
Nani water. Hang on. It should have been me. Not him.

01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:37.420
Well, was that a good impersonation?

01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:53.740
All right. I ate a cookie. There you go.

01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:01.660
I ate a cookie and got any milk with those cookies? I do.

01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:12.780
Yeah, I got milk. Got milk. Yeah.

01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:18.860
I like to drink tea with these, though, these cookies. They're

01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:25.420
what do you call it? They're shortbread cookies called

01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:33.980
Lorna Dome? Lorna Dome? Lorna Dome? Lorna Dome or Lorna Dome? I don't know. One of the two.

01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:42.300
Yeah, Lorna Dome or Lorna Dome cookie. They're good. They're my favorite. I like those a lot. Good cookies.

01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:57.580
They're like, yeah, they're like, it's called shortbread, shortbread cookies.

01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:02.220
Sort of like a, I don't know if it's a biscuit. Maybe a biscuit?

01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:04.220

01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:12.940
It's pronounced Dome. Lorna Dome. Lorna Dome. Yeah, Lorna Dome.

01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:22.940
Yeah, it tastes really good with tea. I like it with tea the most.

01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:29.500
If you guys have them, you should try it. I think you should.

01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:36.220
They're yummy. I have a really big sweet tooth and a salty tooth. I don't know if you call it a salty tooth.

01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:45.020
I really like salt, salty foods, like really, really salty foods. I have a slim gym addiction.

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:57.980
Oh my god, I have HD bad. Like, we were talking about one thing and then we go to another and then to another and then to another and then to another, we never stay on topic.

01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:01.980
I

01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:13.580
Need tea recommendations

01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:18.380
I know I'm gonna say this tea wrong and

01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:21.740
A lot of people always correct me

01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:25.020
But say it wrong on is it

01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:57.180
I really like tea.

01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:58.620
Different types of tea.

01:33:58.620 --> 01:33:59.900
Drink many types.

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:02.220
I like milk tea as well.

01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.220
Milk tea is good.

01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:27.220
You guys want to know a secret?

01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:42.540
Come here, tell your secret, tell your secret.

01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:59.540
I'm lactose intolerant.

01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:27.940
I'm fat and I'm also sugar intolerant.

01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:54.980
I can't have gluten, I can't have gluten.

01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:57.940
But that doesn't stop me, all right?

01:35:57.940 --> 01:36:00.420
I love me some cheese.

01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:07.660
I love me some milk, some good old ice cream.

01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:11.020
I should be eating these cookies right now, but here we are.

01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:12.020
Oh, yeah.

01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:14.020
So good.

01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:27.020
So good.

01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:47.020
It's so good.

01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:49.020
How could you not?

01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:51.020
How could you not?

01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:53.020
It's like a curse.

01:36:53.020 --> 01:37:07.020
All my favorite foods consist of milk and sugar.

01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:09.020
I just have to be careful.

01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:15.020
And so I know someone asked me about what kind of milk I like.

01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:23.020
And I've been drinking almond milk, but I think I might have a slight peanut allergy,

01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:24.020
but I'm not sure.

01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:34.020
So I'm going to go take a test to go find out soon.

01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:36.020
Almond milk is so good though.

01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:41.020
I did the sweetened one though, and I didn't realize that there was a sweetened version,

01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:54.020
and I grabbed that without looking, brought that home, drunk that, and then died the next day.

01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:55.020
It was bad.

01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:57.020
It was my stomach.

01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:00.020
It was so bad.

01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:07.020
What happened?

01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:09.020
What's going on?

01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:12.020
Why does it hurt so bad?

01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:15.020
Help, help me.

01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:36.020
I've never had rice milk before, or oat milk before, and I want to try it.

01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:38.020
I want to try it.

01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:45.020
So maybe I'll try it out on another Zazzledon stream, or just chatting the stream like now,

01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:48.020
until you guess how I feel about it.

01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:52.020
I hope you guys have like brands.

01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:53.020
I need brands.

01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:54.020
I need the fine ones.

01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:56.020
Find the best ones.

01:38:57.020 --> 01:39:01.020
I can drink and stuff.

01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:11.020
Milk sampling stream.

01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:12.020
Yeah!

01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:14.020
All kinds of milk.

01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:24.020
I think rice milk.

01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:34.020
Don't they use rice milk or just rice to make rice wine or something like that?

01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:40.020
Or am I like having a moment right now?

01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:42.020
Cause I don't know.

01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:50.020
Yeah, sake.

01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:57.020
Yeah, sake.

01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:01.020
Is it just rice?

01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:06.020
I thought they put rice milk in it as well.

01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:11.020
Or is that just different brands of sake that do different things?

01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:13.020
Or am I just...

01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:18.020
I've only had sake once.

01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:20.020
One time.

01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:24.020
And on the menu, it was called rice wine.

01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:25.020
So...

01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:30.020
That was the first time I had sake.

01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:32.020
And I don't remember...

01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:35.020
Don't remember...

01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:40.020
What it tasted like.

01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:46.020
Because before that, I was drinking a lot of soju.

01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:49.020
I was kind of drunk that day.

01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:52.020
I was drinking a lot of soju.

01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:55.020
I was a really, really big drunk that day.

01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:04.020
And then we visited like Korean barbecue.

01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:06.020
Korean barbecue.

01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:08.020
Korean barbecue.

01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:17.020
It's not a vibe.

01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:20.020
It's not that scary.

01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:22.020
But she's just hot.

01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:26.020
She gets really strict when she needs to.

01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:29.020
I might do later on down the line.

01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:31.020
I could see it happening.

01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:47.020
So, I wanted to say that...

01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:55.020
To go over all the sick stuff that I've mentioned so far.

01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:59.020
If you can remember all the things I just listed.

01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:02.020
Because there was all over the place, I'm sorry.

01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:10.020
In order to keep up with my health, I have to do a bit of exercise.

01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:15.020
I'm gonna keep myself nice and fat.

01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:18.020
Nice and fat.

01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:24.020
I forgot.

01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:31.020
Which is what gave me the idea.

01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:35.020
To do ASMR workout streams.

01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:40.020
Where I whisper and tell you guys where to go.

01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:44.020
And we exercise together.

01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:03.020
So, we could do my workouts together.

01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:06.020
So, I have to do things like yoga.

01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:09.020
And keep my arm strength up.

01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:12.020
To handle my shoulder issue.

01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:14.020
And my neck issue.

01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:19.020
Because if the rest of my body can't hold up my own big old head.

01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:25.020
I had to make it all strong.

01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:32.020
I had to make it all strong to help with that pain.

01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:34.020
My doctors are yelling at me.

01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:36.020
You need to get stronger.

01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:38.020
Stronger. Worked out.

01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:40.020
Unfit.

01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:42.020
So, I had to do that.

01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:46.020
Pits just arrived.

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:49.020
I'm so jealous.

01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:52.020
So, yeah.

01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:55.020
So, with all the food I'm eating and stuff.

01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:57.020
Can go to...

01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:01.020
The rest of my body.

01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:07.020
And I cannot...

01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:10.020
You know.

01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:14.020
Be a big, big, big strong.

01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:31.020
So, those streams will probably be...

01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:33.020
I don't...

01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:36.020
I think those will be streams here on YouTube.

01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:39.020
If I'm able to.

01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:42.020
Because I'm not sure if I...

01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:45.020
Those would be okay to do.

01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:48.020
Maybe we could like test the waters.

01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:51.020
But I'd have to see how Stroni feels about that.

01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:54.020
And then...

01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:56.020
Um...

01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:03.020
I know a lot of people really want me to do...

01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:05.020
Like the...

01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:09.020
The hypnosis stuff.

01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:11.020
And the...

01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:15.020
Extreme dummy stuff.

01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:17.020
Or be extreme dumb.

01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:19.020
I think I covered some of that.

01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:23.020
But I don't think I'm going to be taking over any of the girls.

01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:24.020
Other girls' roles.

01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:26.020
That's their thing.

01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:28.020
That's what they do.

01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:30.020
And...

01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:32.020
I would have to discuss...

01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:34.020
Maybe some...

01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:38.020
Things...

01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:42.020
With my gen mates to see how they feel about it.

01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:45.020
Maybe collabs or something.

01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:48.020
A little collab here and there.

01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:50.020
You know?

01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:53.020
I like to be vague.

01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:56.020
I don't like telling you guys anything.

01:45:56.020 --> 01:45:59.020
I know everyone else is really sharing with you.

01:45:59.020 --> 01:46:01.020
On what everyone's doing.

01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:04.020
But I like to surprise people.

01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:07.020
I really like to stay on the download.

01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:09.020
And I go...

01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:12.020
I did a thing.

01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:14.020
Do you see it?

01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:16.020
Are you looking at it?

01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:18.020
Do you like it?

01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:24.020
I don't like sharing.

01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:26.020
I like the mystery.

01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:27.020
It's fun.

01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:29.020
And I love seeing all your reactions.

01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:31.020
When it does come out.

01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:33.020
Where everyone freaks out.

01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:36.020
Talking about how I'm hiding my true powers.

01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:38.020
I've seen the morows.

01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:42.020
I got quite a few morows about the shock.

01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:48.020
I bide my time and wait.

01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:50.020
To surprise you.

01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:53.020
Mystery milk.

01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:06.020
So there are things in the work.

01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:09.020
And there are things that are being planned out.

01:47:09.020 --> 01:47:12.020
And it caters quite a lot.

01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:15.020
To a lot of the things that were asked for.

01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:17.020
Some of the...

01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:20.020
A lot of the things that were asked for.

01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:31.020
So you won't have to worry about a thing.

01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:33.020
It's probably gonna be there.

01:47:33.020 --> 01:47:35.020
Most likely.

01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:39.020
But will I say it is?

01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:51.020
So if anyone wants to know about any of the saucier stuff.

01:47:51.020 --> 01:47:54.020
ASMRs and stuff that's most likely gonna be on the Patreon.

01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:56.020
You'll find it.

01:47:56.020 --> 01:47:58.020
In the description.

01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:02.020
If anyone else wants to send me more morows.

01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:04.020
That's also in the description.

01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:09.020
Is that what you call?

01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:11.020
Did I do that right?

01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:15.020
Did I do that right?

01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:20.020
I do like teasing.

01:48:20.020 --> 01:48:22.020
It's fun.

01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:28.020
Yes!

01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:29.020
Mertz 2.

01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:30.020
Mertz 2.

01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:32.020
Also in the description.

01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:34.020
No, just sleep under your chair.

01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:35.020
My ears.

01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:37.020
You wanna see one of my ears?

01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:39.020
Please, thank you.

01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:42.020
Are they nice and fluffy?

01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:46.020
Are they really soft?

01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:48.020
You wanna touch them?

01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:52.020
Wanna wrap them around you like a blanket?

01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:57.020
I'm gonna get on to the merch very soon.

01:48:57.020 --> 01:49:00.020
I was going to save that for last.

01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:03.020
Okay, we'll talk about that soon.

01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:06.020
Thank you for the reminder.

01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:11.020
I have a list of things to talk to you guys about.

01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:13.020
We're gonna talk about this.

01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:14.020
We're gonna talk about this.

01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:15.020
And then this.

01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:16.020
And then this.

01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:18.020
And then we just spend hours talking about anime.

01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:32.020
I don't think I...

01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:34.020
I'm not really...

01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:36.020
I'm really bad at using the moral.

01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:38.020
The marshmallow.

01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:40.020
The moral.

01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:42.020
I'm really bad at using it.

01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:46.020
So I don't know how to post things.

01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:50.020
I'm so sorry.

01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:51.020
It's like...

01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:55.020
It's my first time using this thing.

01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:59.020
So I'm slowly figuring things out.

01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:01.020
So...

01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:04.020
What's that?

01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:06.020
The moral is the marshmallow.

01:50:06.020 --> 01:50:09.020
Where you can ask me questions there.

01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:11.020
And usually I will answer your questions there.

01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:15.020
Or send it to you via there.

01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:18.020
So you can send me stuff in there.

01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:20.020
And you know.

01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:27.020
I'm like old.

01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:29.020
Says you.

01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:31.020
Says you.

01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:33.020
Gotta speaking.

01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:34.020
Hello.

01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:36.020
Been around for eons.

01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:37.020
You know?

01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:38.020
Kinda...

01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:40.020
Kinda been around for a long time.

01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:42.020
You know?

01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:44.020
Been around for a long, really long time.

01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:45.020
You know?

01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:46.020
Yeah.

01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:47.020
Uh...

01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:48.020
Yeah.

01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:49.020
Yeah.

01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:50.020
Yeah.

01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:51.020
Yeah.

01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:54.020
Got us here.

01:50:55.020 --> 01:50:57.020
Yee-haw.

01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:06.020
Hell yeah, brother.

01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:07.020
That's right.

01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:08.020
That's what I'm talking about.

01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:09.020
That's it.

01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:10.020
That's it.

01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:11.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:12.020
Understand.

01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:13.020
That's good.

01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:14.020
Yeah, yeah.

01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:15.020
Yee-haw.

01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:18.020
Guess what?

01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:19.020
Those are good.

01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:20.020
Sorry.

01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:21.020
Sorry.

01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:23.020
You could just...

01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:24.020
You could like...

01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:27.020
There's like a permanent translate.

01:51:27.020 --> 01:51:28.020
Like...

01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:29.020
I think...

01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:30.020
There's a permanent...

01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:31.020
You could add...

01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:34.020
You could put a permanent Google translate.

01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:36.020
At the top.

01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:38.020
It pops up for me.

01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:39.020
You could like put a permanent...

01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:40.020
Like a little...

01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:41.020
Little thingy.

01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:42.020
Little thingy.

01:51:42.020 --> 01:51:44.020
And it translates it for you.

01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:48.020
Just hit random buttons until it works.

01:51:53.020 --> 01:52:00.020
That's about it, kind of you.

01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:09.020
We're riding away to the sunset with this one.

01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:19.020
I don't know if I should say...

01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:34.020
Yeah, I don't know if I should say...

01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:44.020
I know a lot of people are wondering what my accent is.

01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:56.020
I heard some cries about my accent and not being able to figure it out.

01:52:56.020 --> 01:53:05.020
But I'm not Aussie though.

01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:08.020
Keep the accent a mystery?

01:53:08.020 --> 01:53:09.020
Sure, I can do that.

01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:16.020
But what I can tell you is this.

01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:18.020
I am not Dutch.

01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:20.020
No, I'm learning Dutch.

01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:27.020
I've traveled to the Netherlands before, I think last year.

01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:29.020
And it was fun.

01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:33.020
So, I'm learning Dutch.

01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:37.020
Dutch, Dutch, Dutch, Dutch, Dutch.

01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:39.020
Alright, so I'm going to tell you.

01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:44.020
I don't speak various languages.

01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:51.020
But I was raised around various communities.

01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:53.020
And...

01:53:53.020 --> 01:53:55.020
What do you call it?

01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:06.020
So what do you want it?

01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:23.020
Yes, I was raised around a lot of ethnic groups.

01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:34.020
She's just turning to her roots.

01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:41.020
Thank you.

01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:43.020
Oh, my bleeding heart.

01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:48.020
That's so cute.

01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:54.020
That's so cute.

01:54:54.020 --> 01:55:00.020
I like that so much.

01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:07.020
But when I was younger, I was raised around a lot of people who spoke Spanish.

01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:10.020
A lot of people who spoke Spanish.

01:55:10.020 --> 01:55:13.020
I don't speak the language.

01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:21.020
A lot of them were Mexican and Puerto Rican.

01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:26.020
So I was raised around a lot of people who spoke Spanish for a long time.

01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:32.020
So I don't speak Spanish, but because they spoke to me in Spanish a lot and never in English,

01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:35.020
I had to learn to understand Spanish.

01:55:35.020 --> 01:55:42.020
I'm not good at it now, but I was really good at it before where they would talk to me, have a conversation in Spanish,

01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:45.020
and I would just do or respond in English.

01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:49.020
So I cannot read Spanish.

01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:55.020
I can't read it. I can't do that. I'm sorry.

01:55:55.020 --> 01:56:05.020
And then as I got older, I was raised around a lot of people who spoke Japanese and Korean and Mandarin.

01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:16.020
I met a lot of people who came overseas to visit where I live, and they spoke Japanese.

01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:21.020
So I learned a lot from them when I was younger.

01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:23.020
I just so happened to be interested in anime.

01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:28.020
So a lot of people used to be like, oh, you want to be trying to do that.

01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:30.020
You want to be, want to be, want to be.

01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:33.020
It's whatever. I don't care.

01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:47.020
But I was friends with a lot of people who were Asian, so I just picked up a lot of their manualisms.

01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:56.020
I picked up a lot of their manualisms, and I started learning Korean and Japanese back then.

01:56:56.020 --> 01:56:59.020
No, not Cantonese, but Tengalong.

01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:01.020
And Tengalong.

01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:08.020
I knew some people who spoke Tengalong, which I think is the Philippines.

01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:13.020
Filipino. I was friends with a lot of Filipinos.

01:57:14.020 --> 01:57:26.020
And then as I got older, as I got older, I was friends with a lot of people who spoke Russian.

01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:47.020
I didn't travel. I didn't go anywhere. I just happened to meet these people.

01:57:47.020 --> 01:57:49.020
I was just surrounded by these people.

01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:53.020
You know how you meet one person, and then they introduce you to their group of friends,

01:57:53.020 --> 01:57:57.020
and their whole group of friends speak that one language, but you, you're the only one?

01:57:57.020 --> 01:58:02.020
I was always the one person in the group that spoke only English.

01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:05.020
That was me. I was that person.

01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:15.020
I was always the one person in every group, so just the one person that didn't speak the language.

01:58:15.020 --> 01:58:18.020
I was that one person.

01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:29.020
So, yeah.

01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:36.020
So I met a bunch of people who spoke Russian, and then they started teaching me Russian, and they started teaching me.

01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:46.020
And they started, like, talking about it and doing that and doing this, and I was like, oh, yeah, it's cool, it's cool.

01:58:46.020 --> 01:58:56.020
And then there was some people in the group who were Swedish and Poland.

01:58:56.020 --> 01:59:04.020
And so they started teaching me some of the things that they say, some of the words they say, and Swedish and Poland, and I was like, oh, cool, cool, cool.

01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:07.020
I started learning that for, like, a year.

01:59:07.020 --> 01:59:12.020
But of course, nothing sticks because I'm dumb.

01:59:12.020 --> 01:59:20.020
Nothing ever sticks. I'm interested in it for a little while, and then I just kind of, like, since I have no one to talk to in that language, it's gone.

01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:22.020
It's gone.

01:59:22.020 --> 01:59:44.020
And then after that, after that, I started learning Dutch, yeah.

01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:50.020
And then I actually left for the first time ever to go to the Netherlands.

01:59:50.020 --> 02:00:02.020
That was my first time ever leaving my country.

02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:08.020
That was my first time. I've never left it before, so I was excited.

02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:14.020
It was very scary, but it was really fun.

02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:21.020
I was very happy, and I had a lot of fun. I ate a lot of food, and it was really fun.

02:00:21.020 --> 02:00:23.020
Would I go again? Yes.

02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:34.020
I want to travel more. It's like my biggest dream, because with my health, I was scared that I wasn't going to be able to do that.

02:00:34.020 --> 02:00:40.020
To travel and stuff, because my health is, like, really bad.

02:00:40.020 --> 02:00:46.020
So I was very happy to travel for the first time ever.

02:00:46.020 --> 02:00:51.020
And when I got my passport, I was so excited. I cried.

02:00:51.020 --> 02:00:53.020
I got emotional.

02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:59.020
I was crying.

02:01:02.020 --> 02:01:06.020
It was good. It was good. It was fun. I had a fun time.

02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:14.020
Okay.

02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:29.020
Oh, thank you.

02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:34.020
Oh, thank you.

02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:44.020
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:46.020
I'm so sorry.

02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:51.020
We're fine. We're fine.

02:01:54.020 --> 02:01:57.020
I'm a big strong girl.

02:01:57.020 --> 02:02:00.020
I don't cry.

02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:04.020
Crying. I don't do that.

02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:10.020
We don't cry here.

02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:20.020
We're fine.

02:02:24.020 --> 02:02:27.020
More.

02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:29.020
Why?

02:02:29.020 --> 02:02:32.020
But yeah.

02:02:33.020 --> 02:02:42.020
But the last thing on this thread I wanted to mention was fan art.

02:02:42.020 --> 02:02:55.020
I'm okay with any fan art, as long as it's not, you know, the, you know, that word down there.

02:02:56.020 --> 02:02:59.020
As long as it's not done, we're fine.

02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:02.020
Please and thank you.

02:03:04.020 --> 02:03:07.020
Draw what you want. Draw what you will.

02:03:07.020 --> 02:03:12.020
Anything goes. I don't care on paper, little doodles.

02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:15.020
I don't care. Art is art. There's not just anything as bad art.

02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:18.020
I don't care what it looks like.

02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:21.020
Let me share it with the world.

02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:24.020
I really like art. I'm an artist myself.

02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:28.020
I draw too, but I'm a lazy artist.

02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:33.020
So you only get flat colors and messy sketches from me.

02:03:33.020 --> 02:03:41.020
I do draw really detailed stuff sometimes, but I have really bad.

02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:49.020
I have a zone that I get into and I can draw for hours.

02:03:49.020 --> 02:03:52.020
I remember drawing for like 24 hours.

02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:56.020
I didn't eat. I didn't sleep.

02:03:56.020 --> 02:03:58.020
I didn't use the bathroom.

02:03:58.020 --> 02:04:03.020
I don't know what happened. It was like a zone. I was in a zone.

02:04:03.020 --> 02:04:13.020
And I went into extreme details on the art that I drew and I was like going in and I'm like, yeah.

02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:19.020
And if I stop, I can never get that back and draw what was ever on my mind.

02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:25.020
And then I get like stuck and I can't finish the piece and it goes undone forever.

02:04:25.020 --> 02:04:31.020
So I get in a zone and I can't really leave it.

02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:36.020
So that's why I only doodle like sketches and I try to leave it at that.

02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:40.020
I do a doodle and I throw a little color in there and I leave it.

02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:45.020
Or it's just the doodle when I go like I did. I posted this.

02:04:45.020 --> 02:04:53.020
So yeah.

02:04:53.020 --> 02:05:00.020
Yeah, I'm trying to keep you guys here for as long as possible.

02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:08.020
I'll give you company until you see your little sharp friend.

02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:14.020
I was going to keep this so short, but I don't know. I don't know what happened.

02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:20.020
I don't know what happened. We just started rounding about everything.

02:05:20.020 --> 02:05:28.020
This is supposed to be like a super short stream.

02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:31.020
I'm supposed to be so short.

02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:36.020
But I'm rambling. Oh gosh. Am I the apper?

02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:46.020
Am I the apper?

02:05:46.020 --> 02:06:00.020
Time does fly when you're having fun. It's true. I agree.

02:06:00.020 --> 02:06:06.020
Okay.

02:06:06.020 --> 02:06:13.020
Speaking Japanese.

02:06:13.020 --> 02:06:19.020
Am I the endurance streamer from the company? Oh my gosh.

02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:24.020
Oh.

02:06:24.020 --> 02:06:29.020
I did it.

02:06:29.020 --> 02:06:35.020
Oh.

02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:40.020
Sorry.

02:06:40.020 --> 02:06:44.020
The voice is pretty enough. I'm going to say thank you.

02:06:45.020 --> 02:06:50.020
I really don't understand. You guys like my voice.

02:06:50.020 --> 02:06:55.020
Even Amy brought it up earlier and she was talking about it.

02:06:55.020 --> 02:06:59.020
She was conscious of her voice. I think her voice is so cute.

02:06:59.020 --> 02:07:02.020
I wish I could have a voice like hers.

02:07:02.020 --> 02:07:08.020
It's just soft.

02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:11.020
I think it's so cute.

02:07:11.020 --> 02:07:18.020
It's so cute.

02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:23.020
And same goes for Icy's voice. Icy's voice is so cute.

02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:28.020
The small bien. The super small bien.

02:07:28.020 --> 02:07:33.020
I'm going to smush both of them.

02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:38.020
Smush them to their pop.

02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:46.020
Everyone's voice is so good.

02:07:46.020 --> 02:07:52.020
She's beginning to feel like a yep god.

02:07:52.020 --> 02:07:58.020
A minimum reference.

02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:02.020
I never really got to talk about my music taste.

02:08:02.020 --> 02:08:06.020
It's a...

02:08:06.020 --> 02:08:10.020
Everyone has a taste. A specific genre of music.

02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:17.020
But I don't actually listen to extreme, huge range of music.

02:08:17.020 --> 02:08:23.020
When I was younger, I used to be in a choir.

02:08:23.020 --> 02:08:27.020
An advanced choir. So I sung songs a lot.

02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:31.020
Choir like opera.

02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:34.020
It's late.

02:08:34.020 --> 02:08:37.020
It's a little bit you get.

02:08:37.020 --> 02:08:41.020
You used to sing opera?

02:08:41.020 --> 02:08:45.020
I don't want it to be too loud for the microphone.

02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:48.020
I'm scared I'm going to blow your ears off.

02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:52.020
When I sing like that, it gets really loud.

02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:57.020
I used to listen to all sorts of music.

02:08:57.020 --> 02:09:01.020
Classical rap.

02:09:01.020 --> 02:09:05.020
K-pop. Japanese songs.

02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:09.020
Japanese rock. Japanese pop.

02:09:09.020 --> 02:09:13.020
Regular pop.

02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:17.020
So many things. I listen to Mandarin songs.

02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:20.020
Rock.

02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:23.020
Metal. I really like metal.

02:09:23.020 --> 02:09:27.020
Mose. They're fun too.

02:09:27.020 --> 02:09:31.020
I listen to quite a bit.

02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:35.020
I would call it a bit of everything.

02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:39.020
We never do karaoke streams.

02:09:39.020 --> 02:09:43.020
I want to. I do.

02:09:43.020 --> 02:09:47.020
I do. I do. I do.

02:09:47.020 --> 02:09:51.020
But since it's like...

02:09:51.020 --> 02:09:55.020
Since I usually end up singing randomly on stream.

02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:59.020
Just randomly out of the blue.

02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:03.020
I get a little nervous.

02:10:03.020 --> 02:10:07.020
When it comes to prepping for a karaoke stream. What songs are loud?

02:10:07.020 --> 02:10:11.020
What can I pick? What can I sing?

02:10:11.020 --> 02:10:15.020
You know how I get in trouble?

02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:19.020
I'm nervous. I don't want to get in trouble.

02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:23.020
So I don't know what songs to pick. I don't know what is appropriate.

02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:27.020
You know, the YouTubes.

02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:31.020
Don't come for me.

02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:35.020
Bunk me upside the head and go dumb goat.

02:10:35.020 --> 02:10:39.020
I'm so sorry.

02:10:43.020 --> 02:10:47.020
I have a big range of music. I listen to a lot of anime.

02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:51.020
Openings and songs. Opening and endings. I don't really skip them.

02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:55.020
Because I like music. Music is like...

02:10:55.020 --> 02:10:59.020
It speaks to me. It's my heart.

02:10:59.020 --> 02:11:03.020
I get emotional when it comes to anime and music.

02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:07.020
It's my heart. It's what I was raised for. For a long time.

02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:11.020
So if lyrics suddenly start... If I start finally paying attention.

02:11:11.020 --> 02:11:15.020
Usually you listen to a song and you never really...

02:11:15.020 --> 02:11:19.020
You say you don't like the song. But then like a year later or two.

02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:23.020
You listen to the lyrics and now you're like

02:11:23.020 --> 02:11:27.020
What? Wow. This really hits me this time.

02:11:27.020 --> 02:11:31.020
I like this. And now all of a sudden the song is your favorite.

02:11:31.020 --> 02:11:35.020
After hitting on it for like a couple of years.

02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:39.020
I kind of go through that quite often.

02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:49.020
I'm crying in my room.

02:11:53.020 --> 02:11:57.020
You feel the song but never learn it. This is true.

02:11:57.020 --> 02:12:01.020
This is very true. I either feel the song, never learn it.

02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:05.020
Or hate the song. Don't bother to learn it.

02:12:05.020 --> 02:12:09.020
End up liking it.

02:12:09.020 --> 02:12:13.020
Or just... Or like a song

02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:17.020
So much that it's the... That like...

02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:21.020
You have to play this song every day. Every day you go outside.

02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:25.020
Play that song. Or repeat. Not stop.

02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:29.020
I have songs like that. Where I like

02:12:29.020 --> 02:12:33.020
listen to the song over and over and over again.

02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:37.020
It might be a little acoustic there.

02:12:37.020 --> 02:12:41.020
And that record.

02:12:41.020 --> 02:12:45.020
Um...

02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:49.020
Uh oh.

02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:53.020
Oh here we go. Okay chat like

02:12:53.020 --> 02:12:57.020
froze for me for a second.

02:12:57.020 --> 02:13:01.020
I couldn't even read chat.

02:13:01.020 --> 02:13:05.020
The heck?

02:13:05.020 --> 02:13:09.020
Sorry about that.

02:13:09.020 --> 02:13:13.020
I'll just stop moving.

02:13:13.020 --> 02:13:17.020
There we go.

02:13:17.020 --> 02:13:21.020
Uh oh. Uh oh. I used to love Scooby-Doo.

02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:25.020
This was good stuff. Scooby-Doo was great.

02:13:29.020 --> 02:13:33.020
Now chat's back. You're back. Don't worry. It's fixed.

02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:37.020
It's fixed. You're live. You're live. You're live.

02:13:37.020 --> 02:13:41.020
You're back. You're back.

02:13:47.020 --> 02:13:51.020
Do I like plays? Does that mean I like plays as well? Sometimes.

02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:55.020
I am... I can't really... I have a hard time

02:13:55.020 --> 02:13:59.020
focusing. So if the music isn't really catchy. Or like

02:13:59.020 --> 02:14:03.020
pulls me in.

02:14:03.020 --> 02:14:07.020
I'll... I'll... I'll probably fall asleep.

02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:11.020
If I'm honest. I'll probably fall asleep.

02:14:11.020 --> 02:14:15.020
I'll probably fall asleep.

02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:19.020
If it's like long winded speech plays

02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:23.020
like where they're just talking. I'll probably fall asleep. I usually wake up

02:14:23.020 --> 02:14:27.020
but I used to go to plays a lot and I would wake up when they start singing.

02:14:27.020 --> 02:14:31.020
It would always be when they're singing where I will wake up.

02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:35.020
When the moment they start like, she did this. What?

02:14:35.020 --> 02:14:39.020
Oh my god. And then I'm just like...

02:14:49.020 --> 02:14:53.020
But if it's all music? Probably. I'll probably pay attention to it.

02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:57.020
I've seen Hamilton before I believe.

02:14:57.020 --> 02:15:01.020
So yeah.

02:15:01.020 --> 02:15:05.020
If it's all music I'll probably... I'll probably

02:15:05.020 --> 02:15:09.020
have a good watch. A good listen.

02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:13.020
Because I can clap along like, yay!

02:15:13.020 --> 02:15:17.020
Yay!

02:15:17.020 --> 02:15:21.020
And if it's a song I know, I'll sing along.

02:15:27.020 --> 02:15:31.020
Okay.

02:15:47.020 --> 02:15:51.020
I don't know what that was.

02:15:51.020 --> 02:15:55.020
Are there more slides?

02:15:55.020 --> 02:15:59.020
Yeah. I was going to go over the goals again

02:15:59.020 --> 02:16:03.020
but we already did that and we ignored that.

02:16:03.020 --> 02:16:07.020
Oh yeah! Oh my god!

02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:19.020
Oh my god I can believe we forgot!

02:16:19.020 --> 02:16:23.020
I...

02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:27.020
I...

02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:31.020
I...

02:16:31.020 --> 02:16:35.020
I'm so sorry. I'm just going so fast

02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:39.020
and I... I... I...

02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:43.020
I'm so sorry. I'm so distracted.

02:16:43.020 --> 02:16:47.020
Mama forgot. Yeah, she forgot.

02:16:47.020 --> 02:16:51.020
I had some ideas

02:16:51.020 --> 02:16:55.020
for some tags so I had some. And I wanted to see

02:16:55.020 --> 02:16:59.020
if you guys could come up with some as we went. So if any of you had

02:16:59.020 --> 02:17:03.020
like...

02:17:03.020 --> 02:17:07.020
some ideas for live and clips and memes

02:17:07.020 --> 02:17:11.020
we could add them.

02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:21.020
Whoa!

02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:29.020
Let me try and not like open this right now.

02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:33.020

Do lay laughs.

02:18:05.020 --> 02:18:09.020
Was it trying to trick my eyebrows?

02:18:09.020 --> 02:18:13.020
Eyebrows moving too fast.

02:18:13.020 --> 02:18:17.020

Um, let's see if they grow out of this.

Okay.

02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:27.020
Okay.

02:19:27.020 --> 02:19:31.020
My brain is slow, make this up.

02:19:31.020 --> 02:19:35.020
Oh here we go. Let's grow up down.

Sorry, was I praying? Oh, I'm sorry.

02:19:55.020 --> 02:19:59.020
Ha ha ha.

02:19:59.020 --> 02:20:03.020

How do you do a poll? I want to do a poll. How do you do a poll?

02:20:15.020 --> 02:20:19.020
For the live. Which live hashtag you guys want?

Asu live or do a live? Are you doing a poll? I'm not useless. How do you do a poll?

02:20:23.020 --> 02:20:27.020
I need a poll. How do you make

02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:31.020

02:20:31.020 --> 02:20:35.020
How do you make poll?

02:20:35.020 --> 02:20:39.020
How do you make poll? I got you. Don't worry.

02:20:39.020 --> 02:20:43.020
I'm smart. I got this. I'm intelligent.

02:20:43.020 --> 02:20:47.020
I'm intelligent.

02:20:47.020 --> 02:20:51.020
I found it. I'm smart.

02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:55.020
Which live

02:20:55.020 --> 02:20:59.020
tag. Watch the mark.

02:20:59.020 --> 02:21:03.020
Asu live

02:21:03.020 --> 02:21:07.020
or do a live

02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:11.020
like that. Am I smart or what?

02:21:11.020 --> 02:21:15.020
Hell yeah. That's right. I'm intelligent.

02:21:15.020 --> 02:21:19.020
I'm so smart.

02:21:19.020 --> 02:21:23.020
Ha ha ha.

02:21:23.020 --> 02:21:27.020
I'm intelligent. I'm smart.

02:21:27.020 --> 02:21:31.020
That's right.

02:21:31.020 --> 02:21:35.020
I'm smart. I'm actually smart.

02:21:39.020 --> 02:21:43.020
And then it goes out like that.

02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:47.020
Yay. I did it.

02:21:47.020 --> 02:21:51.020
I mean, I knew this from the start. I knew how to do this.

02:21:51.020 --> 02:21:55.020
I was just pulling your leg.

02:22:01.020 --> 02:22:05.020
That's right.

02:22:05.020 --> 02:22:09.020
That's right. I'm smart. I'm intelligent.

02:22:09.020 --> 02:22:13.020
Ha ha ha.

02:22:13.020 --> 02:22:17.020
Ha ha ha.

02:22:17.020 --> 02:22:21.020
Ha ha ha.

02:22:21.020 --> 02:22:25.020
Ha ha ha.

02:22:25.020 --> 02:22:29.020
Ha ha ha.

02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:43.420
when does the pole end? does it end by itself?

02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:53.420
when does the pole end? wait, end it?

02:22:53.420 --> 02:22:59.420
oh, I have to end it!

02:22:59.420 --> 02:23:11.420
oh, okay, okay, I think everyone's voted so far, right?

02:23:11.420 --> 02:23:15.420
there's more votes, so many more votes coming in

02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:21.420
but I think it's pretty clear which one won though

02:23:21.420 --> 02:23:41.420
and we end the pole, and the one that won

02:23:41.420 --> 02:23:47.420
asal lives! asal life won!

02:23:47.420 --> 02:23:51.420
alright, so we're gonna add that in here

02:23:51.420 --> 02:23:57.420
stop it, please, come on, work for me

02:23:57.420 --> 02:23:59.420
won't do me like that

02:23:59.420 --> 02:24:01.420
alright, here we go, yeah, that's right

02:24:01.420 --> 02:24:03.420
that's what I'm talking about

02:24:03.420 --> 02:24:13.420
asal lives!

02:24:13.420 --> 02:24:19.420
is it being used of fudge?

02:24:19.420 --> 02:24:21.420
we gotta come up with something else then

02:24:21.420 --> 02:24:25.420
let me check

02:24:25.420 --> 02:24:29.420
no, we're gonna steal someone else's house tag

02:24:29.420 --> 02:24:33.420
asal life

02:24:33.420 --> 02:24:35.420
yeah, that belongs to someone

02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:37.420
a couple of people actually

02:24:37.420 --> 02:24:43.420
there's a few people who use the same one

02:24:43.420 --> 02:24:51.420
not just one person, but it looks like they took it over

02:24:51.420 --> 02:24:53.420
yeah, that's fine

02:24:53.420 --> 02:24:57.420
alright, so I guess we have to use doolive

02:24:57.420 --> 02:25:01.420
the doolive it is

02:25:01.420 --> 02:25:05.420
we'll check it right now

02:25:05.420 --> 02:25:09.420
a paxry boys

02:25:09.420 --> 02:25:13.420
I went to go look it up real fast, and all I saw was paxry boys

02:25:13.420 --> 02:25:17.420
that's funny

02:25:17.420 --> 02:25:21.420
is that like an event?

02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:33.420
like some sort of event?

02:25:33.420 --> 02:25:37.420
oh my, I mean, I'm sure this event has other tags

02:25:37.420 --> 02:25:45.420
they don't need this tag

02:25:45.420 --> 02:25:49.420
oh yeah, this is really old, it was very long ago

02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:53.420
it doesn't look

02:25:53.420 --> 02:25:59.420
but like it's been used recently

02:25:59.420 --> 02:26:05.420
so, I think we're free

02:26:05.420 --> 02:26:07.420
free to use doolive

02:26:07.420 --> 02:26:09.420
alright, doolive it is

02:26:09.420 --> 02:26:17.420
next we'll do the next one

02:26:17.420 --> 02:26:23.420
we have the clips, which is the daily doolay

02:26:23.420 --> 02:26:29.420
I have daily doolay

02:26:29.420 --> 02:26:35.420
and what else?

02:26:35.420 --> 02:26:39.420
I have daily doolay

02:26:39.420 --> 02:26:41.420
what was it?

02:26:41.420 --> 02:26:55.420
or your other ideas for our clips?

02:26:55.420 --> 02:26:59.420
milky moments, no, I don't think I can use that

02:26:59.420 --> 02:27:03.420
there are other creators with that name

02:27:03.420 --> 02:27:07.420
so I don't want to

02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:11.420
take that

02:27:11.420 --> 02:27:17.420
azuclips

02:27:17.420 --> 02:27:23.420
sounds nice, I like that

02:27:23.420 --> 02:27:25.420
I don't think I should use anything with goat in it

02:27:25.420 --> 02:27:31.420
because there's like a bunch of other, you know, goats like myself

02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:35.420
so, very sure

02:27:35.420 --> 02:27:39.420
I want it to be like

02:27:39.420 --> 02:27:43.420
kind of obvious it's mine

02:27:43.420 --> 02:27:47.420
that's our goat

02:27:55.420 --> 02:27:57.420
doolay clips

02:27:57.420 --> 02:27:59.420
I'll add a third option

02:27:59.420 --> 02:28:09.420
and I think that's the last one and you guys will have to pick from that, okay?

02:28:09.420 --> 02:28:13.420
alright, starting pull now

02:28:13.420 --> 02:28:15.420
which ones do you like?

02:28:15.420 --> 02:28:17.420
which ones do you want?

02:28:17.420 --> 02:28:19.420
which ones do you like?

02:28:19.420 --> 02:28:23.420
my nose is itchy

02:28:27.420 --> 02:28:31.420
scratch, scratch, scratch

02:28:43.420 --> 02:28:45.420
I'll wait a little bit

02:28:45.420 --> 02:28:49.420
little bit, little bit

02:28:49.420 --> 02:28:53.420
scratch, scratch, scratch

02:29:13.420 --> 02:29:17.420
and I think that

02:29:17.420 --> 02:29:19.420
50, 50

02:29:19.420 --> 02:29:23.420
it's like at a hard 50

02:29:23.420 --> 02:29:25.420
let's count down from 3

02:29:25.420 --> 02:29:31.420
3, 2, 1

02:29:31.420 --> 02:29:35.420
and 0, we end the pull

02:29:43.420 --> 02:29:45.420
what, 1?

02:29:45.420 --> 02:29:49.420
it was no 50, I was wrong, I was off

02:29:49.420 --> 02:29:55.420
it only showed me 1

02:29:55.420 --> 02:29:57.420
doolay, daily doolay

02:29:57.420 --> 02:29:59.420
it's daily doolay now

02:29:59.420 --> 02:30:01.420
for the clips

02:30:01.420 --> 02:30:03.420
daily doolay

02:30:03.420 --> 02:30:05.420
ba, ba, ba

02:30:05.420 --> 02:30:07.420
it's as good, it's as good

02:30:11.420 --> 02:30:13.420
I'm blue, we're one for that

02:30:13.420 --> 02:30:15.420
blue

02:30:19.420 --> 02:30:21.420
let me see

02:30:27.420 --> 02:30:29.420
I'm a nice little teal

02:30:29.420 --> 02:30:33.420
nice teal, I'm a little teal teal goat

02:30:33.420 --> 02:30:35.420
teal teal goat

02:30:37.420 --> 02:30:41.420
blue green, blue green like the sea, like the ocean

02:30:41.420 --> 02:30:45.420
the grand blue ocean

02:30:45.420 --> 02:30:49.420
yes, I'm a teal teal teal goat

02:30:49.420 --> 02:30:53.420
and hang on, let me um

02:30:53.420 --> 02:30:57.420
write that down before I forget

02:30:57.420 --> 02:30:59.420
we're gonna put that in here

02:31:03.420 --> 02:31:05.420

02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:15.420
and if you wanna put in one

02:31:17.420 --> 02:31:21.420
what other idea we could put in for a third option

02:31:23.420 --> 02:31:25.420
let me pull this up

02:31:25.420 --> 02:31:27.420
let me pull this up

02:31:37.420 --> 02:31:39.420
imagine if we made a hashtag

02:31:39.420 --> 02:31:41.420

02:32:13.420 --> 02:32:15.420

02:32:19.420 --> 02:32:21.420

02:40:51.540 --> 02:40:57.660
Yeah, for corn for clips by Azura for for me that's a good idea

02:40:58.660 --> 02:41:00.660
What do we have for clips again?

02:41:03.300 --> 02:41:07.100
Daily delay well daily delay for clips

02:41:23.940 --> 02:41:25.940
Daily delay

02:41:28.660 --> 02:41:30.660
Okay, so

02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:43.340
By Azura we can leave yapper

02:41:43.940 --> 02:41:49.100
We can leave by Azura as the meme since I see everyone seems to agree with this

02:41:49.900 --> 02:41:53.420
Everyone's like that more we're gonna do yapper corn versus

02:41:54.420 --> 02:41:56.420
Daily delay

02:41:58.180 --> 02:42:00.620
Okay, how's that?

02:42:03.020 --> 02:42:07.540

02:42:22.820 --> 02:42:28.980
And your goddess wills what she wants

02:42:37.860 --> 02:42:41.140
And I think there should be a second poll

02:42:51.940 --> 02:42:56.160
It's either it's either you guys pick it for like we don't have a lot

02:43:03.660 --> 02:43:09.060
Do you want yapper corn for the live or do you guys want it for the

02:45:20.620 --> 02:45:23.900
Yay, yay, we did it

02:45:23.900 --> 02:45:25.900

Scrolls, but I don't think we should call ourselves that. I hear it call yourself

02:47:13.900 --> 02:47:17.740
It's cute. I love it, but we can keep it for like a inside joke. How's that?

02:47:19.020 --> 02:47:21.020
Hmm, how's that?

02:47:21.420 --> 02:47:28.540
And I can address you as adoring fans every now and then. All right, how's that keep that between us?

02:47:28.780 --> 02:47:30.780
Okay

02:47:55.020 --> 02:47:57.020

Good. I'm happy. I'm happy you're great, and

02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:08.100
And that's it for that

02:48:09.620 --> 02:48:11.620
And I think that's it I

02:48:12.340 --> 02:48:14.340
Think we went over

02:48:14.340 --> 02:48:20.060
Pretty much everything and then I just had these I wanted to just go over some of these and then that was it

02:48:20.580 --> 02:48:22.580

02:48:32.340 --> 02:48:34.340
Yay

02:48:40.300 --> 02:48:42.300
We did it

02:48:55.300 --> 02:48:57.300
I

02:49:12.740 --> 02:49:19.580
Picked out some morals, but I I'm praying

02:49:19.580 --> 02:49:21.580
I

02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:26.340
Properly filtered something

02:49:36.580 --> 02:49:38.580
Let's go through this

02:49:49.580 --> 02:49:55.060
We do that you're smart you're so smart you're so smart

02:50:20.420 --> 02:50:25.020
Oh, that's not this one's not too bad

02:50:33.660 --> 02:50:35.660
This is fine

02:50:38.180 --> 02:50:40.180
I swear that's already in here it is

02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:52.340
Yeah

02:51:05.060 --> 02:51:07.060
Wow

02:51:07.940 --> 02:51:12.100
So congratulations on your day feels as well

02:51:12.460 --> 02:51:18.540
My question is in your opinion after working with VLOR for some time now

02:51:18.700 --> 02:51:20.700
How would you describe their management?

02:51:21.260 --> 02:51:25.140
They asked me if I could not ignore it. I say management is awesome

02:51:26.620 --> 02:51:30.140
They work really hard to get everyone's stuff done and they

02:51:31.220 --> 02:51:35.900
Get it done very quickly, and I think it's that's pretty cool, and they're very

02:51:36.940 --> 02:51:38.940
How do you say?

02:51:39.380 --> 02:51:41.020
understanding

02:51:41.060 --> 02:51:43.060
very understanding and I

02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:49.260
Appreciate that. I feel very welcomed and wanted and I really love it here already

02:51:49.260 --> 02:51:52.860
And I hope it will continue to be the best

02:51:53.620 --> 02:51:55.620
experience it can be

02:51:56.300 --> 02:51:59.700
So far so please I really love this

02:52:01.100 --> 02:52:03.100
Company so much already

02:52:04.100 --> 02:52:11.140
I mean son has been very helpful the manager son has been very very very helpful and very good at what they do

02:52:16.540 --> 02:52:20.820
All my mistakes were on me if I'm really honest I did make a

02:52:21.260 --> 02:52:26.820
Trying to like fix stuff at PC issues. I had so many issues going on

02:52:27.740 --> 02:52:32.460
The person who helped me out with all of that was means and manager

02:52:34.100 --> 02:52:37.860
Manager help me out so much with everything so

02:52:40.300 --> 02:52:42.300
I'm not a very tech savvy

02:52:43.220 --> 02:52:45.220
so I

02:52:45.980 --> 02:52:48.820
Appreciate that that hope that I got it was very necessary

02:52:51.540 --> 02:52:53.820
So yeah, that's all I feel

02:52:57.460 --> 02:52:59.460
The next question

02:52:59.980 --> 02:53:01.980
Hello, that's debut

02:53:03.180 --> 02:53:10.020
My question is have you met your gen maids in your life or have you only the chance to meet them online?

02:53:10.340 --> 02:53:13.980
Also, what is your first impression on them? I've given my impression on them

02:53:14.820 --> 02:53:17.460
very shortly during the deal and I

02:53:18.460 --> 02:53:20.460
Really love them so much

02:53:20.660 --> 02:53:22.660
They make me feel very

02:53:24.100 --> 02:53:26.100
At home

02:53:26.740 --> 02:53:27.900
I

02:53:27.900 --> 02:53:31.780
Do get kind of nervous around them, and I've heard that I'm quite

02:53:32.540 --> 02:53:41.820
Intimidating so I hope that we can warm up even more as time goes and we've done played games together already

02:53:43.220 --> 02:53:49.460
Thank you saying I was really good at the game, but I just I don't know I I I I was just

02:53:50.340 --> 02:53:53.020
Normally playing said games and enjoying it

02:53:53.020 --> 02:53:55.020
So

02:53:56.380 --> 02:54:00.540
I'm just very observant and I like to like pick out things I see it

02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:25.020
I

02:54:25.020 --> 02:54:31.420
Hopefully we'll warm up a little more and no I have not met them in real life yet, but maybe one day we will

02:54:33.580 --> 02:54:35.580
And I hope that

02:54:35.940 --> 02:54:39.460
That comes to the past and I really do want to meet my gen maids

02:54:39.460 --> 02:54:44.820
I think it'd be really fun like going to conventions or cons together our events and stuff as

02:54:45.620 --> 02:54:47.620
us

02:54:48.780 --> 02:54:50.780
As me

02:54:51.660 --> 02:54:59.620
And stuff like that and maybe even stream like in person together. That'd be fun, but yeah, I think what

02:54:59.620 --> 02:55:01.620
And

02:55:15.380 --> 02:55:18.900
Okay, I wouldn't be a surprised if you're getting other

02:55:22.660 --> 02:55:24.660
So here's something

02:55:24.660 --> 02:55:31.220
I would love comfort sleep ASMR just coming breathing heartbeat, maybe some comforting speech for me, you know, whatever

02:55:31.860 --> 02:55:33.860
I just like the idea

02:55:35.980 --> 02:55:40.020
Interaction so far. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to the baby. Oh

02:55:41.220 --> 02:55:42.620
What's to come?

02:55:42.620 --> 02:55:46.140
Yes, actually, this is something that I've always wanted to do

02:55:46.140 --> 02:55:50.820
I think I've mentioned it in the debut where I said I wanted to do sleep ASMR

02:55:51.820 --> 02:55:57.800
He obeyed or I either sing you a lullaby read you a bedtime story or like just

02:55:58.380 --> 02:56:04.700
Babble to you about something and comfort you like it's okay. You could sleep. It's fine

02:56:05.820 --> 02:56:13.060
Nina little head pad. I've had your head with some ASMR sounds of me cuddling or petting you

02:56:13.500 --> 02:56:18.060
Things like that, you know and healthy sleep. I wanted to do things like like that

02:56:21.780 --> 02:56:28.300
The heartbeat breathing all of that all of it. I want to do all of that comfort comfort ASMR

02:56:33.820 --> 02:56:39.620
So I want to just bring that up so I that you all know what kind of content to expect from me

02:56:39.620 --> 02:56:41.300
Maybe in the future

02:56:41.300 --> 02:56:46.540
But the majority of the time is yes, I am a gamer. I am a gamer. I play a lot of games. I

02:56:48.100 --> 02:56:50.100
Don't think I'll

02:56:51.820 --> 02:56:53.820
Don't think I'll be

02:56:58.700 --> 02:57:03.540
Streaming a lot of league League of Legends. Yes, I said I like league and yes

02:57:03.540 --> 02:57:08.500
I said I like playing league, but do not expect me to play league. Um, I

02:57:08.940 --> 02:57:10.940
Don't think I'm going to play it

02:57:14.740 --> 02:57:16.740
So yeah

02:57:17.420 --> 02:57:21.900
So I brought up league early, but I forgot to mention that I wasn't gonna play it

02:57:25.100 --> 02:57:30.900
There might be a random time when like if I have free time and I have a and I do a random morning

02:57:30.900 --> 02:57:38.100
Stream that I plan at the time or something if it's a morning stream. Oh, I probably might be bored and

02:57:39.300 --> 02:57:45.860
Choose to stream some league just like hey, there's a random league stream if anyone wants to come you're free to come

02:57:45.860 --> 02:57:48.740
It's fine. I understand a lot of people don't like league, but

02:57:51.460 --> 02:57:55.860
League is my comfort game league is a game that I actually enjoy that helps me like

02:57:57.140 --> 02:58:03.140
With racing thoughts. So I play league. I don't have to stream it. I could play it off stream

02:58:03.860 --> 02:58:05.860
So it doesn't need to be streamed

02:58:07.940 --> 02:58:09.940
It's just uh

02:58:09.940 --> 02:58:14.580
A thing that I like to play and I thought that sharing my interest is better than um

02:58:15.460 --> 02:58:17.460
Just you know, yeah

02:58:20.420 --> 02:58:24.820
Everyone has a comfort game. I hear some people have apex legends as their comfort game

02:58:25.140 --> 02:58:29.860
People have shooting games of their comfort game. I can have mine. Come on. Come on

02:58:30.740 --> 02:58:32.740
Come on

02:58:34.580 --> 02:58:36.580
League isn't that bad

02:58:37.540 --> 02:58:39.540
I

02:58:42.580 --> 02:58:47.220
Understand their concerns of how Lee can be a bit not comforting

02:58:56.340 --> 02:59:01.380
Worry odds that you will do a total gen one collab like all of us collabing together

02:59:01.940 --> 02:59:03.940
There's a high chance for that

02:59:04.580 --> 02:59:06.580
It's pretty high

02:59:07.620 --> 02:59:13.140
I thought we would never not do it. So all of us clubbing together. Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty high

02:59:14.500 --> 02:59:16.500
It's pretty pretty it's pretty pretty high

02:59:23.540 --> 02:59:27.860
Technically, yeah, technically, I'll redone one. Yeah, right. It has happened before. Yeah

02:59:29.860 --> 02:59:31.860
It's pretty high

02:59:32.580 --> 02:59:34.580
Um, and we have

02:59:36.260 --> 02:59:40.980
This one's not that bad, right? It's not that bad. I'm not that bad. It's not that bad, all right

02:59:41.540 --> 02:59:45.060
Well, mommy enjoys being a sub too, right? I'm sort of being a sub

02:59:47.460 --> 02:59:49.460
Encouraging, you know

02:59:49.780 --> 02:59:51.780
Though I have bad kids so sometimes

02:59:52.420 --> 02:59:55.140
I already mentioned this before that. Yes

02:59:56.500 --> 03:00:00.900
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I cater to quite a lot of things and

03:00:01.540 --> 03:00:03.540
You should expect both

03:00:04.340 --> 03:00:06.340
So not at all

03:00:21.060 --> 03:00:25.780
She been everyone and Emmy and everyone has been talking about what they want to do and the things that they will do

03:00:26.420 --> 03:00:27.540
um

03:00:27.540 --> 03:00:29.540
That's fine. I don't mind

03:00:30.260 --> 03:00:32.260
Uh it at all. Um

03:00:32.900 --> 03:00:34.900
I'm going to do what I like regardless

03:00:35.220 --> 03:00:37.220
um, and that has always been my plan

03:00:37.540 --> 03:00:42.420
And I do not mind. I'm fine with that. It's perfectly fine. Um

03:00:44.100 --> 03:00:48.820
Besides, I think I already fit the vibes already. So I don't think that's a problem

03:00:49.700 --> 03:00:51.700
Oh

03:00:55.940 --> 03:00:59.940
And do I prefer mama or mommy, I think I mentioned this in a tweet

03:01:00.420 --> 03:01:02.420
Uh, I

03:01:02.500 --> 03:01:04.500
They both sound good

03:01:04.500 --> 03:01:06.500
I like mama asu

03:01:06.500 --> 03:01:08.500
But I don't mind being called mommy

03:01:08.820 --> 03:01:10.820
so

03:01:11.060 --> 03:01:13.060
Yeah

03:01:13.780 --> 03:01:16.980
Yeah, I don't mind. I thought I just bring it up here

03:01:19.220 --> 03:01:21.220
I

03:01:26.740 --> 03:01:31.380
How do you like your coffee with lots of sugar and milk or cream

03:01:32.100 --> 03:01:37.700
Of vanilla cream. Actually, I like it sweet. I don't like it dark

03:01:38.420 --> 03:01:44.180
How do you call it black? Thank you for coffee. I like, uh, really sweet milky coffee

03:01:44.660 --> 03:01:48.100
Mm-hmm. I would put like at least three

03:01:57.140 --> 03:01:59.940
That is my alarm

03:02:01.060 --> 03:02:08.500
For me to take my medication. Yay medication and it is also 11. So um, I believe

03:02:09.460 --> 03:02:16.020
Marcy should be going live soon and we'll be reading it to her very soon. So

03:02:17.060 --> 03:02:20.580
We'll gather around the campfire and get ready for our Marcy's ring

03:02:20.580 --> 03:02:22.580
And

03:02:34.100 --> 03:02:35.620
So I am

03:02:35.620 --> 03:02:37.620
And then the last one was the same thing

03:02:37.620 --> 03:02:41.700
I think had a question of the plans of the asmr content streams

03:02:42.100 --> 03:02:44.100
Yeah, I plan to do some

03:02:44.420 --> 03:02:47.860
Asmr's on stream live as well

03:02:48.820 --> 03:02:54.980
So I hope you all look forward to that and look at my picture and then oh that was even the last one

03:02:56.180 --> 03:03:00.980
Oh my current brain rot. I like cat memes lots and lots of cat memes

03:03:01.460 --> 03:03:05.140
You know those stupid memes where they portray cats in a relationship

03:03:06.020 --> 03:03:08.020
Those are my brain rocks

03:03:08.420 --> 03:03:10.420
The cat memes

03:03:11.300 --> 03:03:13.300
The cat memes

03:03:18.100 --> 03:03:20.100
I

03:03:20.500 --> 03:03:28.260
Don't know if this tech talk because I go through youtube shorts. I watch through youtube shorts and the insta shorts

03:03:31.060 --> 03:03:33.060
Those are my those are what I watch

03:03:34.660 --> 03:03:37.540
