00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
so when your poo hits your prostate on the way out,

167
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,080
it feels like a poo.

168
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,080
Jarby was a poo.

169
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
Jarby is a poo.

170
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,080
What is this?

171
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
What is this?

172
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,880
Is Amy sucking?

173
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Amy's suckers are never hot too.

174
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,280
Oh wait, is she giving a blowjob?

175
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,320
That's what it looks like.

176
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,480
That's what it looks like to me.

177
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
Oh, oh.

178
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
Real?

179
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,080
Oh my God.

180
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
I love this.

181
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,480
This is so fucking good.

182
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,200
The drill is so good.

183
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Oh boy.

184
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
We are.

185
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
It's an old boy.

186
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Over some pie.

187
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Okay, that's cute.

188
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
That's cute.

189
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
I love that.

190
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
That's really cute toy.

191
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
How is that a cat?

192
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,120
How is that a cat?

193
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,120
Meow.

194
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,120
Meow, winky face.

195
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,120
Okay, it's a winky face.

196
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,120
I was like, what is meow?

197
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
I was like, who?

198
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
It's Spanish, haven't I?

199
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120
It's Spanish.

200
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
We are so good.

201
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,120
That's good.

202
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,120
I love that.

203
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Oh.

204
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Oh.

205
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Oh no.

206
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
Okay, this makes sense.

207
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,040
This makes sense of what Earth we were drawing.

208
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Because we have to check out and like that's items on the shelves.

209
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,040
I worked really hard.

210
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Oh my God.

211
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Oh, this is a good time for it.

212
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,040
I see you understood me.

213
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Oh my God.

214
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,960
Oh, I love the details.

215
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,960
Taking a magic shot.

216
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,960
Oh no, did it go to DC?

217
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Is there a check?

218
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Yeah.

219
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
Is there a DC check?

220
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
Are you in the lobby?

221
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Do you need to reload the lobby?

222
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,960
It's going to do it on its own usually.

223
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,960
No, I'm gone.

224
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
The link should be in the discord.

225
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,880
Don't show your fucking screen on the discord.

226
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,880
Yeah.

227
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Don't do that.

228
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
Don't do that.

229
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,880
I don't see all of our naughty photos we just send to each other.

230
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
I want to do that.

231
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
It's mostly memes.

232
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
Any memes.

233
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
I mean, to be fair, we did share.

234
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
We did share some actually.

235
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,880
We did share some lucky nudes of ours.

236
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,880
They've seen my titties.

237
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I saw Brooklyn as the girls with my nudes.

238
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
So I was like, this is what Amy would do.

239
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
This is what A.C. would do.

240
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Your discord is so chaotic.

241
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Okay, real though.

242
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,800
But also, I did snort out my tea.

243
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,800
It went down the wrong hole and went up my nose.

244
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Wow, Marcy, I hear you snort in tea.

245
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,800
This is what got me off at the stock throne.

246
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Is this better?

247
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
It hurts so much.

248
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Can you hear me now?

249
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Oh, yeah.

250
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Oh my god.

251
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
That's why you guys win riffs on to me.

252
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
I'm so sorry.

253
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
My clit is getting a little heart beat right now every time you talk.

254
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Oh no.

255
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,800
I was muted and my thingy was turned down.

256
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
That's my bad.

257
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
Oopsie.

258
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Oopsie.

259
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,800
I feel like Azura could do a really good Jennifer Coolidge impression.

260
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Jennifer Coolidge.

261
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
I don't know what Jennifer Coolidge is impression.

262
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
She was like, wait, you don't know Jennifer Coolidge?

263
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Jennifer Coolidge.

264
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
I am such a big tittie.

265
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,800
Oh my god.

266
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
I can't do it.

267
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,800
I can't do it.

268
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
I can't do it.

269
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
I can't do it.

270
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
I can't do it.

271
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
I can't do it.

272
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
I can't do it.

273
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Oh my god.

274
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Jennifer Coolidge.

275
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Speaking of your gap for the Rizzler.

276
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
That's so good.

277
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Why are we opening our gap for the Rizzler?

278
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
I just dropped the bass.

279
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Blown, blown.

280
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
The discreet is not working.

281
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
Click that link in the general description.

282
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
It's not with discreet's preference.

283
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Is it only in that end?

284
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
No.

285
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Are you okay?

286
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
Are you okay?

287
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
What is happening?

288
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
All I hear is screaming.

289
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Your mic cuts out.

290
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
So it just goes eww.

291
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Eww.

292
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
Eww.

293
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
I don't even know what's happening.

294
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
It's constantly loading.

295
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
It says, did you know

296
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Group DLs

297
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
can have up to 10 members?

298
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,800
I'm sorry.

299
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,800
Now I see the discord.

300
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,800
If I open it up, you guys can't see it.

301
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
My discord is just broken.

302
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
I don't see anything else.

303
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
I would close the window capture

304
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
in the OBS just in case.

305
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Yes, you can turn it off.

306
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Are we starting a new lobby?

307
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
A new lobby?

308
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Hang on.

309
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,800
Let me invite to this lobby.

310
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
That's power.

311
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Are we going to a different room?

312
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
I don't know.

313
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
What is that?

314
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,800
I only see one of you.

315
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
On mine, sorry.

316
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
A new one?

317
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
There's another one.

318
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
Are you okay?

319
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Okay, which one should we play?

320
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Which one?

321
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Normal, which we just did.

322
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Knock off, keep yourself focused.

323
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Try to replicate the drawings while the clock gets faster.

324
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
Animation.

325
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Create animations in a collaborative way.

326
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Icebreaker, play with a sentence.

327
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
Drawings, exquisite corpse.

328
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Create surrealist characters connected by the top of the drawings.

329
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Don't know what that means.

330
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
Hold on.

331
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
Burp friends, have a good time with that.

332
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Compliment, complete the sketch.

333
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Start with basic lines and see other players' interpretations.

334
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
Masterpiece,

335
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
create a piece of art, play in a single turn with no time limit.

336
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
I feel like story would be funny.

337
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,800
Write a narrative using only the previous sentence as a reference.

338
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Yes, okay, okay.

339
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Story, story, story.

340
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
Do you want to do a story?

341
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Let's try story.

342
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,800
What are we doing?

343
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,800
What is this?

344
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Start writing a story.

345
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Wait, do I have to write a full story or just a sentence?

346
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
Just a sentence.

347
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Just one sentence.

348
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,800
Okay, okay.

349
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
Do you like write the whole story or no?

350
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,800
No, you have really limited characters.

351
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
I don't know it.

352
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
No!

353
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
What did you do?

354
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,800
There's time, there's time.

355
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
15 seconds, love.

356
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Oh my god, I wanted to write more.

357
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
I wanted to write more.

358
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
You can only write one sentence.

359
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Fuck.

360
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
Shit.

361
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
The end.

362
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
We are not being attack allegations.

363
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
We are not.

364
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
What the fuck is happening?

365
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Oh, they're going to know this is me spelling it

366
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,800
because I didn't use a Z on that.

367
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,800
I'm just going to leave it like that.

368
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Yep, I'm sending it.

369
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
I'm not even spell checking.

370
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Fuck it.

371
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Fuck it.

372
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Fuck it.

373
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
I'm bad at stories.

374
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
What?

375
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
So big.

376
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Oh, the sentence is so small.

377
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
I want to give up everything.

378
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
Me too.

379
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Let's do short.

380
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
I think I get shorter over time.

381
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
I want to be like, bi-bing.

382
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,800
I'm going to write until, fuck.

383
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,800
What?

384
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
Um, okay.

385
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Let's see.

386
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
Let's see.

387
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Oh, no.

388
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Fuck.

389
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Fuck, I'm so bad.

390
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Fuck.

391
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
It's funny because

392
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
I hate this. I can't think of anything.

393
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
The wavelengths, the snowberries, the snippets,

394
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
the pin pals,

395
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
the bleeding hearts and the harem

396
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,800
all get to see this unfold

397
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
and we're all just taping like

398
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Oh, fuck it.

399
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
I don't fucking know.

400
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
Oh, you.

401
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Wait, is that the fucking

402
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,800
and

403
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,800
happy kitty

404
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
sleepy kitty

405
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
purr purr purr.

406
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,800
You watch fucking

407
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,800
big bang theory.

408
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Wait, that's my spell.

409
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,800
Paris.

410
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Fuck.

411
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Give me more.

412
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
I need more letters.

413
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
I need more like

414
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
amazing

415
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
amazing

416
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
writer.

417
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
They jerk so hard.

418
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Motherfuckers want to find me.

419
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
That sounds like sheavey.

420
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
No.

421
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
They jerk so hard.

422
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Motherfuckers want to find me.

423
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
I don't know this lyric though.

424
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
This agency

425
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
is crazy.

426
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
We can't just

427
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
I spelled it wrong but that's the point.

428
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
I hate that's like

429
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
they don't give you enough to write.

430
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
It's like

431
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
this is not enough.

432
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Fuck off.

433
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
Oh boy. Okay, let's see what's happening.

434
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,800
What the fuck is going to be?

435
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Let's do the auto.

436
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,800
This is terrible.

437
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,800
How about everybody reads their own story?

438
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Yeah, of course.

439
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
Okay, I go first.

440
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,800
In a galaxy far far away

441
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
there was a goat with big titties.

442
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,800
She had so much milkers

443
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,800
and started raining milk.

444
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
Azera then went home

445
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,800
to make an empire made milk daily.

446
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,800
It was so successful

447
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,800
the neighboring kingdoms became jealous.

448
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
They also wanted some of the juicy.

449
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Ew cooties are not good.

450
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Good.

451
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
You're not good.

452
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,800
You're not good.

453
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Oh boy.

454
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
Why do we both start to sing?

455
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
There was a boy by a princess

456
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
who was trying to fit in too.

457
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,780
Oh

458
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,780
My hand yeah

459
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,780
I didn't know what this is but

460
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,780
I was like this thing didn't change.

461
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,780
Oh gosh.

462
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,780
Oh my god.

463
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,380
I was so hard.

464
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,380
Ronnie, who was in Paris?

465
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,380
I was in Paris!

466
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,380
I was in Paris!

467
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,380
I was in Paris!

468
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,380
It was just a beach of agency that was lit.

469
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:35,380
They all couldn't control the urges that they had.

470
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,380
So they danced, the pee-pee danced until they...

471
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:46,980
Then finally, they peed everywhere on the floor, the walls, the bed, the kind.

472
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,980
We're all filled up.

473
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,980
There's everywhere, but he loved it.

474
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:56,980
The fact that we got the best prompt before AC came out with that.

475
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,980
He's either going to be AC or not.

476
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,980
AC got a box of booze!

477
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,980
AC in the morn.

478
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,980
Heard.

479
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,980
Sevens character added.

480
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,980
This is so good.

481
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,580
Okay.

482
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,580
Once upon a time, there were whores.

483
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,580
They were the eliters of whores.

484
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,580
Bitches in the wild west.

485
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,580
They all were really cute cowgirls.

486
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,580
Boozy cats.

487
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,580
So cute.

488
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,580
So fuzzy.

489
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,580
So pussy-warm.

490
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,580
Big bang theory.

491
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,580
More like bang-bang your mom last night.

492
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,580
You keep my mom out of your home now.

493
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,580
Sorry.

494
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,580
10 out of 10.

495
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,180
At the time, they were like big thoms.

496
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,180
Oh, no.

497
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,180
Oh, no.

498
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,180
Oh, no.

499
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,180
What's going on?

500
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,180
Big thoms!

501
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,180
What's going on?

502
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,180
What's going on?

503
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,780
No, no, no.

504
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,780
It took a lot!

505
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,780
What's going on?

506
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,780
My face hurts a lot.

507
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,780
This is so bad.

508
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,780
Once upon a time,

509
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,780
she even had to take a nap.

510
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,780
A community zero wrote about each other.

511
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,780
She was sad because she realized

512
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,780
she didn't have a prostate.

513
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,780
I said shit.

514
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,780
No way!

515
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,740
Why do I keep talking about shit all the time?

516
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,140
Alright, this is so bad. I hate this.

517
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,540
Fuck no!

518
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,540
No, I didn't want to be pregnant by Sonic!

519
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,700
Ezra, do you have a make filter on? I can never hear you.

520
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,500
I don't.

521
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,500
Piss me, you don't!

522
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,620
Turn that mic.

523
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,100
Get us!

524
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,700
I don't have a filter on!

525
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,700
No, it's fine!

526
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,700
You don't have a filter on!

527
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,020
There's no filter on?

528
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,020
No, there's no filter on.

529
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,020
You're still series filter.

530
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:14,020
I don't have a filter. I don't have one on.

531
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,020
Definitely, so you guys can hear it on all my phones.

532
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,020
What is happening?

533
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,020
Hang on.

534
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,020
Can't wait for the board if they survive.

535
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,020
Yeah, these ones, I don't know.

536
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,020
They'll be fine, don't worry about it.

537
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,020
You guys don't play this one or do you want to try another one?

538
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,020
It's peaking.

539
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,020
That was an incomplete drawing.

540
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,020
Please, please, no more shits.

541
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,020
No more shits!

542
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,020
No more shits!

543
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,020
No promises!

544
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,020
No promises, I can't promise.

545
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,020
Did you guys miss stuff?

546
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,020
Did you miss the compliment?

547
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,020
Yeah, I promised that.

548
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,020
Compliment.

549
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,020
All the actions are a mystery.

550
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,020
Drawings and sentences are hidden during this.

551
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,020
You can't hear Mercy?

552
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,020
Sorry, sorry.

553
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,020
Because I was coughing because I was laughing

554
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,020
my side hurts so badly.

555
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,020
No.

556
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,020
Okay, Mercy test complete.

557
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,020
Do you want to do compliment?

558
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,020
What is that?

559
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,020
We draw on each other's drawings, basically.

560
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,020
Oh, we should try that.

561
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,020
I think that would be fun.

562
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,020
Yeah.

563
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,020
We could draw so much piss.

564
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,020
Oh god.

565
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,020
Let's start sketching some basic lines.

566
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,020
Okay.

567
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,020
Let me do this.

568
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,020
Maybe I could just...

569
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,020
Maybe I'll do some basic lines.

570
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,020
Like, ooh.

571
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,020
Okay, boom.

572
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,020
Ooh.

573
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,020
Wait, now I'm just going to draw a bunch of dicks.

574
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,020
The castle.

575
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,020
I can't believe it.

576
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,020
The castle.

577
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,020
No!

578
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,020
Cute.

579
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,020
Blockers.

580
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,020
Oh god.

581
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,020
You know exactly what you did.

582
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,020
And no, I don't have the strength to resist.

583
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,020
What?

584
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,020
Wait, I got it. I got it.

585
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,020
I can make this. I can salvage this.

586
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,020
This is the back legs of it.

587
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,020
And then this is its huge

588
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,020
milkers.

589
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,020
Like...

590
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,020
Oh.

591
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,020
Oh.

592
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,020
Oh.

593
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,020
A big

594
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,020
fish up bruh.

595
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,020
Oh my god, I've just made shimmy up.

596
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,020
What the hell?

597
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,020
What is my name?

598
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,020
Oh wait, that's a thing.

599
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,020
Oh no, that looks like...

600
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,020
Dang it.

601
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,020
Give me the pencil.

602
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,020
There we go.

603
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,020
I saved it.

604
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,020
I saved it.

605
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,020
Baby, give you a lot more time

606
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,020
for the second one.

607
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,020
Yeah, you're to finish it.

608
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,020
Ah, you need to finish it.

609
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,020
Okay, I'm fucking stupid, never mind.

610
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,020
Okay.

611
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,020
So am I, don't worry. Saved it.

612
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,020
Let me look at it.

613
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,020
Help.

614
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,020
Let's put some nice shading in.

615
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,020
To make this look extra beautiful.

616
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,020
Wow.

617
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,020
Let's put lipstick on.

618
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,020
Beautiful.

619
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,020
Yeah.

620
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,020
So beautiful.

621
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,020
I saved it.

622
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,020
They prank him.

623
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,020
I think this is the best one.

624
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,020
Maybe a better one.

625
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,020
Oh, wait.

626
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,020
Who drew a pair of hairy ballsack?

627
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,020
Come on.

628
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,020
What the fuck?

629
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,020
What the fuck?

630
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,020
You have to add the shaft.

631
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,020
I really know what I want to do,

632
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,020
but I know I shouldn't do it

633
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,020
because we're on YouTube.

634
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,020
I'm missing this.

635
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,020
Oh, no.

636
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,020
I can't make one thing.

637
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,020
This is amazing.

638
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,020
Oh, wait, maybe. Hold on.

639
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,020
I got it.

640
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,020
I got it.

641
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,020
I got it.

642
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,020
I gotta go back.

643
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,020
This is so fucking good.

644
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,020
Let's fucking go.

645
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,020
I'm trying so hard right now.

646
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,020
I can't even think of anything to say.

647
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,020
I'm like trying so hard.

648
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,020
Oh, my gosh. Use your imagination.

649
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
Use your imagination.

650
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,020
There you go.

651
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,020
I'm so proud of you.

652
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,020
Aww.

653
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,020
Refling.

654
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,020
We need to be nice to the camera.

655
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,020
Your laugh is so fucking lazy.

656
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,020
Thank you.

657
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,020
I got you a six.

658
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,020
I think they did my really well.

659
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,020
Yeah, it's a water bottle.

660
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,020
That's the best I got.

661
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,920
Quick quick quick.

662
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,580
I saved the pair of mall sacs.

663
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,720
Did you make it into a dog or something?

664
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,580
No, it just works.

665
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,860
Can you, Senpais, can you do better, shut the fuck up.

666
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,800
I love when you do that.

667
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,720
Shut the fuck up.

668
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,800
Oh my God.

669
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,800
What is this?

670
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,800
What is this?

671
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,800
I got the hairy mall facts.

672
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,800
What?

673
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Hold on. Give me a second.

674
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
You're asking me not to draw a vagina.

675
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,800
What do I do here?

676
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
How am I supposed to do this?

677
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,800
What can we do here?

678
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
What can we do here?

679
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
How do I make this?

680
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,800
How do I save this?

681
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
Hmm.

682
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
Uh...

683
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
Hmm.

684
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,800
Hmm.

685
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,800
Hmm.

686
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,800
Okay.

687
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,800
Okay, I won't draw that.

688
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,800
Because that would be...

689
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,800
Oh my god. I just realized...

690
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,800
I'll draw this in the sky.

691
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Mercy snippets of like fucking Grogu.

692
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
Hmm.

693
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,800
From Star Wars.

694
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,800
Oh wait, no. Is it heartbreak on the chair?

695
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,800
I did it! Saved it!

696
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,800
I saved it!

697
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,800
Women were less immature than men.

698
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,800
You're wrong.

699
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,800
I was gonna draw a coochie or a woman giving birth,

700
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,800
but I'm not gonna...

701
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

702
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
I literally don't know what the fuck I'm doing right now.

703
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
There you go.

704
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,800
Wait, hold on.

705
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,800
Oh my god, I have time.

706
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
One, two, three.

707
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,800
I guess who it is now.

708
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,800
I can do this.

709
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,800
What the fuck I'm doing?

710
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,800
Fuck!

711
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
And then pen pals.

712
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,800
Pen pals.

713
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,800
Fuck.

714
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,800
Pen pals.

715
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,800
I'm running out of time.

716
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,800
Oh my god, this is...

717
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,800
And then volcano.

718
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
These are light ones.

719
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,800
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.

720
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,800
I got it, I got it, I got it.

721
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,800
Fuck!

722
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,800
Are you out of...

723
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,800
I don't know, I don't know.

724
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,800
These are light ones!

725
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800
I did it.

726
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
Oh god, refunds.

727
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,800
Refunds, how could I forget your...

728
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,800
I saved it, I saved it!

729
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,800
I think I did a good job.

730
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,800
This is the best I got.

731
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,800
I ain't got nothing.

732
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,800
No!

733
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
I don't like this.

734
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,800
Why do I feel like...

735
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,800
This is a really specific reference.

736
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
I don't know if anyone's gonna get it,

737
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,800
but there used to be a flash game

738
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,800
where your guy was on like a snowboard.

739
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,800
I love that game!

740
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,800
Yeah, someone should literally just drawn that.

741
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,800
Literally, this is perfect.

742
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,800
That's my drawing.

743
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,800
Someone says lane raider.

744
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Oh, is that what it's called?

745
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,800
Rift.

746
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,800
Rift.

747
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,800
Rift.

748
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,800
What is bear pantsu?

749
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,800
Oh!

750
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,800
Panties.

751
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,800
Panties.

752
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,800
I don't want to weigh all of this.

753
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,800
People were asking me to draw a bear wearing underwear.

754
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,800
I was like, what the fuck is wrong with you guys?

755
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,800
Panties and pants.

756
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,800
I remember fancy pants.

757
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,800
Because he had big old pants that were fancy.

758
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,800
Rain up and now it's not the time.

759
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,800
And you know the story!

760
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,800
Is he blundered or did I make that up?

761
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,800
You know the story!

762
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,800
I might make that up.

763
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,800
I might make that up.

764
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,800
Wait, hydration check, girl.

765
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,800
Is that a one-year-old dying?

766
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,800
Okay.

767
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,800
You know the story.

768
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,800
His pants read.

769
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,800
He's gargling my balls, sorry.

770
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,800
He had no hair color, but his pants read yellow.

771
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,800
Did he have a beard? I don't know.

772
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,800
I'm going to do something.

773
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,800
Needs hip dial.

774
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,800
Yeah, you're right.

775
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,800
I don't really know how to do that though.

776
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,800
Can I zoom in?

777
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,800
Yeah!

778
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,800
Something with a beer braid.

779
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,800
Braid is pantsu?

780
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,800
Wait, it doesn't have pants?

781
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,800
Yeah!

782
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,800
No fuck, I didn't mean to have that.

783
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,800
What is this? Who drew ball sacks everywhere?

784
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,800
It's not you, Shibi.

785
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,800
I only see boobs.

786
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,800
No, I didn't draw a ball sack.

787
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,800
I got it.

788
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,800
Who's whispering?

789
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,800
What? I have no idea.

790
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,800
What? Who's whispering?

791
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,800
Who's whispering?

792
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,800
Who's whispering some evil incantations to us?

793
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,800
Wait, no, that's not nice.

794
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,800
This is all a C right now,

795
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,800
and I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.

796
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,800
It was definitely Azura that drew the ball sack, 100%.

797
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,800
Why do I feel like this is a lie?

798
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,800
No, I didn't draw it.

799
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,800
I'm really drawing over it right now.

800
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,800
If you guys didn't know,

801
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,800
Azura's ears actually have golden

802
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,800
little jewelry on the end of them.

803
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,800
Oh no.

804
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,800
This is icing.

805
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,800
She pimped out with jewelry, but it's like

806
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,800
not a vanity thing.

807
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,800
Here you go. Gifts.

808
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,800
Going for her first bike ride.

809
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,800
Right.

810
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,800
Isn't cheating to erase? Aw, fuck it is.

811
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,800
Isn't it cute?

812
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,800
Right.

813
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,800
So if you didn't know, when a woman

814
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,800
when a woman lactates,

815
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,800
she will have a...

816
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,800
I got it.

817
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,800
It goes through the fabric, okay?

818
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,800
So they'll be like a couple.

819
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,800
I know this isn't Azura's.

820
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,800
Aw, it's terrible.

821
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,800
Get rid of that.

822
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,800
Oh my god.

823
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,800
I want to live with my life.

824
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,800
I was trying to talk about lactation, though.

825
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,800
Yeah, it was right before she said chocolate.

826
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,800
Milk.

827
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,800
Milk.

828
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,800
The best I got.

829
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,800
Shit.

830
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,800
That's the timer.

831
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,800
Oh.

832
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,800
I thought you were drawing a cute bunny face.

833
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,800
Nah, they have some titties, mate.

834
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,800
It's all I can see.

835
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,800
I have saved...

836
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,800
I have single-handedly saved the stream, probably.

837
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,800
Let me do that.

838
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,800
This is supposed to be it.

839
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,800
The liquid.

840
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,800
The liquid.

841
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,800
Oh, I have to draw my own drawing?

842
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,800
Fine.

843
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,800
What is this?

844
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,800
That's nothing!

845
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,800
That's nothing!

846
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,800
Fine.

847
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,800
I don't even know what to draw for my own drawing.

848
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,800
Fine.

849
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,800
I started it,

850
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,800
and I'm going to finish it.

851
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,800
It's me.

852
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,800
Okay, fucking man over here.

853
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,800
I don't know.

854
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,800
I'm already pooped from this.

855
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,800
Just make a little snack.

856
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,800
Just a little snack.

857
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,800
A little whip.

858
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,800
It's the old...

859
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,800
It's the old Mac, okay?

860
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,800
Okay.

861
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,800
Okay.

862
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,800
I would talk, but it takes too much brain power

863
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,800
to do this.

864
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,800
You're a little cheery.

865
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,800
And talk.

866
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,800
Get a little...

867
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,800
Yeah.

868
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,800
Yeah.

869
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,800
Stop!

870
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,800
This is a net.

871
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,800
Yeah.

872
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,800
Pretty good net.

873
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,800
Yeah.

874
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,800
I think I need to grab one.

875
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,800
How do you spell squelch?

876
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,800
Squelch?

877
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,800
Squelch?

878
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,800
Yeah.

879
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,800
Yeah.

880
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,800
Is it the arm that's going?

881
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,800
Oh my god.

882
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,800
Is it the reverse Amazon position

883
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,800
when the girls...

884
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,800
What are you drawing?

885
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,800
Reverse Amazon is like eBay?

886
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,800
Reverse Amazon is like eBay?

887
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,800
Yeah.

888
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,800
That's definitely what it's about.

889
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,800
Wait, any quicker?

890
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,800
Is it hydrate?

891
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,800
No!

892
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,800
Okay, let's see our albums.

893
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,800
Is anybody need to take a quick break

894
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,800
before...

895
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,800
I'm ready.

896
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,800
Let's go.

897
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,800
I'm ready.

898
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,800
Let's do this.

899
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,800
That was yours.

900
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,800
Okay, okay.

901
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,800
What the hell?

902
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,800
What?

903
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,800
Oh, he's...

904
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,800
Okay.

905
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,800
Okay.

906
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,800
Is it Orsor's hand?

907
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,800
Oh my god, I think it's the other...

908
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,800
Yeah, the other me.

909
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,800
Oh, that's so good.

910
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,800
What do you mean you're a bad artist?

911
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,800
That's a very good little bear.

912
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,800
That's beautiful.

913
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,800
That's good.

914
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,800
He got a border under the blanket and everything.

915
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,800
Oh, it's the artist.

916
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,800
Beautiful.

917
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,800
What else could I draw for this?

918
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,800
Oh, that's so cute.

919
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,800
That's so cute.

920
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,800
We're so, so cute.

921
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,800
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

922
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,800
Oh, die.

923
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,800
Die.

924
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,800
I like it.

925
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,800
I did it for his milk.

926
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,800
Open now.

927
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,800
Oh my god.

928
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,800
Oh my god.

929
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,800
I saved them.

930
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,800
I lied.

931
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,800
I didn't save the stream at all.

932
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,800
I was...

933
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,800
If I don't see a snail...

934
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,800
Oh my god.

935
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,800
Oh, shit.

936
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,800
Oh my god.

937
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,800
Oh, that's so cute.

938
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,800
Oh, that's so cute.

939
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,800
Oh, it's mine.

940
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,800
It is.

941
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,800
I love replays.

942
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,800
Oh my god, that's so cute.

943
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,800
Oh.

944
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,800
And then there's me.

945
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,800
And then there's...

946
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,800
I was like, it makes me...

947
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,800
Oh my god.

948
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,800
Mine broke.

949
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,800
Oh my god.

950
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,800
Oh, that's so cute.

951
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,800
Oh.

952
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,800
How is he cute?

953
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,800
Yeah, that was cute.

954
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,800
He's a rat boy.

955
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,800
Oh my god.

956
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,800
Oh, that's so cute.

957
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,800
That's so cute.

958
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,800
Oh.

959
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,800
Oh my god.

960
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,800
That's so cute.

961
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,800
Oh.

962
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,800
Literally me.

963
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,800
That's me.

964
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,800
Oh.

965
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,800
That's mine.

966
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,800
Oh my god.

967
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,800
He's so bad.

968
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,800
I can't show that.

969
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,800
I see.

970
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,800
We'll do it me and the boys.

971
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,800
Oh, okay, okay.

972
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,800
Oh my god, that's so good.

973
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,800
Why the mono bro?

974
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,800
Wait.

975
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,800
Why are you guys...

976
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,800
Oh my god.

977
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,800
Really calm.

978
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,800
Wait, I drew this little game.

979
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,800
I was like, oh, this is a lane ranger.

980
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,800
I like it.

981
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,800
Oh, that's good.

982
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,800
That's creative.

983
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,800
Yeah, that's good.

984
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,800
Oh, I love that.

985
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,800
Oh.

986
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,800
That's really cute.

987
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,800
I love that.

988
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,800
Oh, that's cute.

989
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,800
I told you.

990
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,800
I told you.

991
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,800
I told you.

992
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,800
I love you.

993
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,800
What is this?

994
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,800
Lama Chuba for Gentoo.

995
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,800
I was gonna say that's a good one

996
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,800
and then I saw the thing on the right.

997
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,800
That's cute, Mercy.

998
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,800
I told you.

999
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,800
She's learning how to ride a bike.

1000
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,800
What the fuck?

1001
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,800
Oh, that was good.

1002
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,800
Oh, that was so fucking good.

1003
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,800
I ended up being the most innocent.

1004
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,800
Oh, that was good.

1005
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,800
Oh my god.

1006
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,800
Time and stuff.

1007
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,800
Help.

1008
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,800
I can't breathe.

1009
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,800
This is what it's like to be in VLR.

1010
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,800
So fucking giving birth!

1011
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,800
I want to figure out what icebreaker is.

1012
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,800
Icebreaker is kind of boring.

1013
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,800
What are we doing?

1014
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,800
I'll stop it.

1015
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,800
What are we doing?

1016
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,800
What?

1017
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,800
Icebreaker is kind of boring.

1018
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,800
Yeah, it's boring.

1019
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,800
Can I cancel it?

1020
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,800
If you want.

1021
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,800
How do I cancel it?

1022
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,800
Wait, are we doing this or are we cancelling it?

1023
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,800
I don't know.

1024
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,800
I cancel it.

1025
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,800
What is happening?

1026
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,800
What is happening?

1027
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,800
Oh, there's a fucking ad.

1028
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,800
I'm just making another room.

1029
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,800
I'm making another room.

1030
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,800
Okay, okay, okay.

1031
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,800
All right.

1032
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,800
Where is my carrier that?

1033
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,800
You guys can see John Snow and Sansa start.

1034
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,800
Wait, no, you put me back in.

1035
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,800
They still advertise.

1036
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,800
Wait, so do we have a new one?

1037
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,800
Do we have a new one?

1038
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,800
Yeah, it says one of seven.

1039
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,800
Wait, what is happening?

1040
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,800
I don't know what is happening.

1041
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,800
Somebody else make a lobby.

1042
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,800
It's not the greatest, but we can just play it.

1043
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,800
No, somebody else make a lobby.

1044
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,800
Do we have a new lobby or not?

1045
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,800
Somebody else make it because

1046
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,800
I made a new one.

1047
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,800
I was trying to make a new one.

1048
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,800
Everyone, hate the asset.

1049
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,800
Hate the game.

1050
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,800
The graphic phone window.

1051
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,800
And then someone make a new one.

1052
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,800
I can't make it because of my connections.

1053
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,800
I'll do it.

1054
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,800
Okay.

1055
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,800
See, Emmy proven what a big girl she is.

1056
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,800
That was so fucking weird.

1057
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,800
I'm sorry.

1058
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,800
So fucking creepy.

1059
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,800
I'm so sorry.

1060
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,800
Sorry.

1061
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,800
It's so chaotic.

1062
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,800
I don't know why there's two of me on the screen.

1063
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,800
I hate that.

1064
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,800
I hate that.

1065
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,800
So we are opening in your lobby?

1066
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,800
I hate that.

1067
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,800
Let me just put up a new one.

1068
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,800
She was a link in the discord, you can hate.

1069
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,800
Okay, okay, okay.

1070
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,800
I understand.

1071
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,800
Okay.

1072
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,800
Understood.

1073
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,800
So, yes sir.

1074
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,800
Let me open the link.

1075
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,800
There we go, nice and easy.

1076
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,800
I'll go Apecha.

1077
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,800
Okay, is everyone here?

1078
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,800
I'm here.

1079
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,800
I'm here.

1080
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,800
Yeah, we're here.

1081
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,800
Okay, which one do you want to play?

1082
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,800
I don't know.

1083
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,800
Knock off is fun.

1084
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,800
Because it's like, super...

1085
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,800
Try to replicate the drawing.

1086
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,800
Oh yeah, do knock off.

1087
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,800
Do knock off, that looks good.

1088
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,800
Okay.

1089
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,800
Because you make it pretty drawing and then

1090
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,800
it becomes hell.

1091
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,800
Wait, why are we supposed to draw?

1092
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,800
Anything you want.

1093
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,800
Anything?

1094
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,800
No, not you.

1095
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,800
Maybe not anything for you.

1096
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,800
No, not shit.

1097
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,800
Please give us something.

1098
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,800
I'm being put on the spot, my main's going blank.

1099
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,800
Okay, hold on.

1100
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,800
Let's do a count.

1101
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,800
Cheebie, we can't see.

1102
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,800
I'll draw.

1103
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,800
I'm taking off the blindfold or fine now.

1104
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,800
I'll draw Cheebie.

1105
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,800
Should we all just draw somebody?

1106
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,800
Oh.

1107
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,800
No, I'm joking.

1108
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,800
I was like, ooh, I'm kind of locked in now.

1109
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,800
Sorry, sorry.

1110
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,800
I've decided to draw one of us

1111
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,800
that I have already said out loud.

1112
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,800
I don't know what to draw.

1113
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,800
Guys, give me an idea.

1114
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,800
Don't put me on the spot.

1115
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,800
Don't put me on the spot, I don't know.

1116
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,800
I don't even know what to draw.

1117
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,800
Put me on the G-spot.

1118
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,800
Oh, one of you guys, so I'm going to choose.

1119
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,800
Yeah.

1120
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,800
Are you coming for a ride?

1121
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,800
This is terrible on a mouse.

1122
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,800
That one's actually funny.

1123
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,800
How much time do we have?

1124
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,800
Can I draw the whole gang again?

1125
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,800
I'll make it.

1126
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,800
You have quite a bit of time with this one.

1127
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,800
Okay, hold on.

1128
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,800
What the fuck is the whole gang with this?

1129
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,800
Oh, that's not very...

1130
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,800
No, no, no, no.

1131
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,800
How the fuck do you draw something sitting down?

1132
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,800
Oh my God, I'm having a stroke.

1133
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,800
I'm not a good guy.

1134
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,800
What on earth?

1135
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,800
There's a good kind?

1136
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,800
I'm supposed to be at the very...

1137
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,800
That's close enough.

1138
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,800
How do you say after this?

1139
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,800
Oh my God.

1140
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,800
Oh my God.

1141
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,800
I'm going to draw harmony.

1142
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,800
I'm going to draw your name.

1143
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,800
Perfect. I can't draw like this.

1144
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,800
Wait, it has kind of like...

1145
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,800
His nickname.

1146
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,800
We need to draw the devilish hat.

1147
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,800
Fuck.

1148
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,800
This is hard because I don't know what to fucking draw.

1149
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,800
Get creative, nerds.

1150
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,800
Jeez, it's not that hard.

1151
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,800
I'm doing it.

1152
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,800
I'm playing dead, okay?

1153
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,800
Okay, Miss Artis.

1154
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,800
I'm playing dead.

1155
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,800
I'm just going to draw myself casual

1156
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,800
and it comes out with this fucking banger of a commission.

1157
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,800
It would probably cost like $500 to do.

1158
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,800
And I'm like, oh my God.

1159
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,800
I'm going to make a VTuber model.

1160
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,800
Don't ask the way.

1161
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,800
I wish I could...

1162
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,800
I'm doing a figure-nerval talent.

1163
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,800
Speaking of that,

1164
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,800
send me a fucking marshmallow.

1165
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,800
They were like, thank you for not tying down

1166
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,800
your talents to the designs

1167
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,800
that you assigned them and they can be more themselves.

1168
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,800
And I'm like, yeah, well,

1169
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,800
why would I do that?

1170
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,800
I was like, I don't know why.

1171
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,800
I feel like it's such a basic thing.

1172
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,800
What the fuck do I need to draw next?

1173
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,800
A bleeding heart.

1174
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,800
Yeah, we're more like building upon

1175
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,800
characters rather than

1176
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,800
changing everything.

1177
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,800
Oh, someone rated the VTuber.

1178
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,800
They were like, the only thing that would have

1179
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,800
been better is if you let them design

1180
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,800
their models.

1181
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,800
From the start, I'm like, bro, it took me

1182
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,800
a fucking year to get here.

1183
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,800
Oh my God, give me...

1184
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,800
It takes forever to...

1185
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,800
It is not like an overnight thing.

1186
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,800
Draw and rig a VTuber model.

1187
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,800
You can ask Amy.

1188
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,800
She knows how to do it.

1189
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,800
It's a lot of work.

1190
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,800
Oh my God.

1191
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,800
Yeah, there's only a select few corpos

1192
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,800
that will let you do that.

1193
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,800
It literally takes a little long.

1194
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,800
Oh shit. Oh shit.

1195
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,800
Man, this is rough.

1196
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,800
Usually ones that have like artists in house

1197
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,800
are like...

1198
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,800
Yeah, we don't.

1199
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,800
This is so bad.

1200
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,800
Most companies, if not all of them,

1201
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,800
say first, you

1202
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,800
will have

1203
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,800
pre-made

1204
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,800
pre-made.

1205
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,800
So it's not actually standard

1206
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,800
for people to choose.

1207
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,800
Yeah, it's really not.

1208
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,800
That's why it's usually they

1209
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,800
cast for the roles.

1210
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,800
You have to fit the character they're looking for

1211
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,800
and have the voice.

1212
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,800
Oh.

1213
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,800
There.

1214
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,800
What the fuck is that?

1215
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,800
Stop.

1216
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,800
Oh, it looks like an abomination.

1217
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,800
Oh.

1218
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,800
Oh no.

1219
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,800
I'm complicated.

1220
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,800
What is this?

1221
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,800
Fuck.

1222
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,800
Okay.

1223
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,800
I like how cute this is.

1224
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,800
Okay.

1225
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,800
Okay, now we have to draw it.

1226
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,800
Are we ready?

1227
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,800
Yeah.

1228
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,800
No, but...

1229
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,800
I have to be...

1230
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,800
I have to be ready for it.

1231
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,800
Even if I'm not...

1232
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,800
It's okay.

1233
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,800
Just draw it your way

1234
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,800
and that's the fun part.

1235
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,800
Yeah. Very nice.

1236
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,800
I've already forgot which position everyone...

1237
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,800
Fuck.

1238
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,800
Bro, this is so bad.

1239
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,800
Sorry, we flinched honestly.

1240
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,800
I would talk more, but this takes so much brain power

1241
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,800
to do this.

1242
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,800
I'm so brain dead.

1243
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,800
I feel so bad.

1244
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,800
I'm like dying.

1245
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,800
I'm reading chat, I'm reading everything,

1246
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,800
but I'm not responding.

1247
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,800
I'm so sorry.

1248
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,800
I can see everyone and see what you're all saying.

1249
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,800
I'm just really in this.

1250
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,800
I feel like I'm just...

1251
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,800
Fuck, I'm just fucking losing it.

1252
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,800
Oh my god, wait!

1253
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,800
I forgot there was a shorter time!

1254
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,800
Fuck!

1255
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,800
That's far too short, so it's...

1256
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,800
This is why it's chaotic.

1257
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,800
Why was the other one longer?

1258
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,800
I don't remember what...

1259
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,800
Ah!

1260
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,800
Oh my god, what?

1261
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,800
What is this?

1262
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,800
Okay.

1263
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,800
Okay.

1264
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,800
I have no clue what it was.

1265
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,800
Okay, okay, okay.

1266
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,800
Okay.

1267
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,800
Fuck, the time!

1268
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,800
We draw this as fast as we can.

1269
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,800
Oh fuck!

1270
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,800
Ah!

1271
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,800
No, no, no, no!

1272
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,800
Not like this!

1273
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,800
Shit, shit, shit!

1274
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,800
I can't remember what it looked like.

1275
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,800
Is there supposed to be someone in a pirate boat, by the way?

1276
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,800
Because I don't think I saw it.

1277
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,800
Is there supposed to be a person in it?

1278
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,800
I don't know, it's already gone.

1279
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,800
It's just a person.

1280
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,800
It's supposed to...

1281
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,800
It's supposed to go really fast, so it...

1282
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,800
Oh my god!

1283
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,800
Okay, that's easy enough.

1284
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,800
That's easy enough.

1285
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,800
Oh, it's already up!

1286
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,800
Okay.

1287
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,800
Gotta go fast, gotta go fast!

1288
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,800
Gotta go fast!

1289
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,800
Faster, faster, oh fuck.

1290
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,800
Faster, faster!

1291
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,800
Ah!

1292
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,800
Oh my god, I am so sorry.

1293
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,800
Come on.

1294
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,800
Faster, oh!

1295
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,800
Faster!

1296
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,800
Faster!

1297
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,800
Ah!

1298
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,800
Okay, okay, okay.

1299
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,800
Oh, hey, it's me.

1300
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,800
Why is it so flat?

1301
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,800
Oh no, no, no!

1302
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,800
Okay, okay, okay, okay, we can do this, we can do this.

1303
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,800
We can do this.

1304
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,800
Okay, okay, okay.

1305
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,800
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1306
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,800
Don't panic, don't panic.

1307
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,800
The great part is that we are all panicking.

1308
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,800
Oh no, no, no, no!

1309
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,800
One more time.

1310
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,800
One more time.

1311
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,800
What is this?

1312
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,800
What even is that?

1313
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,800
Okay, this is easy, this is easy, easy, easy.

1314
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,800
This has to be mittens, this has to be mittens.

1315
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,800
Easy, easy, easy.

1316
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,800
Was it blue? I can't remember blue.

1317
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,800
Let's fucking go.

1318
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,800
Man, this looks like shade, but oh wow.

1319
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,800
I mean, that's close enough.

1320
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,800
Oh my god.

1321
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,800
That's close enough.

1322
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,800
Oh my god.

1323
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,800
That's amazing.

1324
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,800
I love this.

1325
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,800
What does her have all the time?

1326
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,800
I did not have any time for this.

1327
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,800
I was like, this is Mr. Min.

1328
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,800
This is Mr. Min.

1329
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,800
At least it's me and the cat.

1330
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,800
Oh my god.

1331
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,800
I'm excited to cat.

1332
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,800
That's a little campfire with all of us together.

1333
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,800
That's fucking cute.

1334
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,800
That's a little campfire with all of us together.

1335
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,800
That's a little campfire with all of us together.

1336
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,800
That's fucking cute.

1337
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,800
I don't have time.

1338
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,800
I don't have time.

1339
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,800
That's what it's supposed to be.

1340
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,800
I'm stuck.

1341
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,800
I'm stuck in the face.

1342
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,800
I'm stuck in the face.

1343
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,800
I'm stuck in the face.

1344
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,800
I'm stuck in the face.

1345
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,800
I'm stuck in the face.

1346
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:09,800
I'm stuck in the face.

1347
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,800
That's so good.

1348
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,800
At the end of the day,

1349
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,800
we're all just suffering here.

1350
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,800
This is good.

1351
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,800
This stayed good.

1352
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,800
That's perfect circle.

1353
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:50,440
I was getting more and more depressed, somebody said.

1354
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:53,880
Oh, she's not in jail.

1355
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,920
She's at the cage.

1356
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,240
I thought she was in jail.

1357
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,720
OK, that's fine.

1358
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:00,720
I get it.

1359
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,200
Oh, my god.

1360
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,680
She was under arrest.

1361
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:13,400
I love this.

1362
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,400
Help.

1363
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,400
It's back down.

1364
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,800
She broke her jail by the end.

1365
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,800
Oh, my goodness.

1366
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,800
She's free.

1367
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,800
Wow.

1368
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,800
I love all the details.

1369
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,800
One piece.

1370
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,800
I was like, why the heck are we doing this?

1371
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,800
I was like, what the heck are we doing here?

1372
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:42,800
I was like, stop me.

1373
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:43,800
Oh, no.

1374
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,800
I was just getting ugly.

1375
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,800
I was trying to draw the line.

1376
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:52,800
Oh, my god.

1377
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,800
I was trying to draw the line on it.

1378
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,800
I was like, I can't.

1379
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,800
I was like, oh.

1380
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,800
She was shooting her piss.

1381
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,800
Wait, that's supposed to be me?

1382
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,800
Are you kissing as a girl?

1383
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:28,800
You're giving the rest of the piss it needs to serve her?

1384
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,800
The piss will revive him.

1385
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:32,800
Oh.

1386
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,800
The piss will revive him.

1387
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,800
Oh, my god.

1388
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,800
Oh, it's still good, right?

1389
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,800
One more.

1390
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:48,800
One more.

1391
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,800
Which one?

1392
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,800
One more.

1393
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,800
Give us one more.

1394
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,800
One more.

1395
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,800
One more.

1396
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,800
What would have we not done?

1397
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,800
I don't know.

1398
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,800
I don't remember.

1399
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,800
Secret.

1400
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:05,800
All the actions are a mystery.

1401
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,800
Drawing incentives are hitting during the game.

1402
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,800
What's secret?

1403
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,800
Secret seems rough.

1404
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,800
I've never done that one before.

1405
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,800
All right, since they're a mystery.

1406
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,800
OK.

1407
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:18,800
We'll try it.

1408
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,800
We'll try it.

1409
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:20,800
Last friend, boys.

1410
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,800
Last friend.

1411
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,800
OK, OK, OK.

1412
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,800
Oh, shit.

1413
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,800
Oh, what?

1414
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:27,800
I can't see what I'm writing.

1415
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,800
Oh, secret.

1416
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,800
How am I supposed to know what I'm writing?

1417
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,800
Wait, what?

1418
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,800
Huh?

1419
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,800
Yeah.

1420
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,800
Oh, no, wait.

1421
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,800
You run out of freaking words?

1422
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:40,800
Oh, bro.

1423
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,800
I can't erase my things.

1424
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,800
I don't know.

1425
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,800
What is this?

1426
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,800
Of course.

1427
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,800
What is this?

1428
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,800
What is happening?

1429
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,800
It just appears.

1430
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,800
Oh, we can't see what we're drawing.

1431
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:00,800
What?

1432
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,800
OK, we'll draw fast.

1433
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,800
We'll draw fast.

1434
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,800
What the fuck?

1435
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,800
OK.

1436
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:08,800
OK.

1437
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,800
I don't know.

1438
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:15,800
I think I'm going to just guess what it is, where it is.

1439
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,800
That's so funny.

1440
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,800
Oh, god.

1441
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,800
What the fuck?

1442
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:26,800
Oh, no, no.

1443
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:27,800
I'm going to try to draw.

1444
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,800
Why is it so hard to draw with a bow?

1445
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,800
What is that?

1446
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,800
OK.

1447
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,800
OK.

1448
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:40,800
OK.

1449
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,800
I failed that.

1450
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:42,800
Oh, no.

1451
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,800
I didn't finish it.

1452
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,800
Oh, come on.

1453
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,800
What the fuck?

1454
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,800
What?

1455
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,800
What does that even mean?

1456
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,800
What the fuck?

1457
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,800
What does that even mean?

1458
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,800
What the fuck?

1459
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,800
I think it's so sad.

1460
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:00,800
OK.

1461
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,800
OK.

1462
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,800
OK.

1463
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,800
Oh, fuck.

1464
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,800
Oh, fuck.

1465
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,800
I don't know what else to draw.

1466
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:12,800
That's exactly what I drew, I think.

1467
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,800
Is this a vain reference?

1468
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,800
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

1469
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,800
Locked in.

1470
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,800
I locked in.

1471
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,800
Did I give...

1472
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,800
Wait, I spelled that wrong.

1473
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,800
Wait, did I give them bodies?

1474
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:26,800
Oh, my God.

1475
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,800
I don't even know where they are.

1476
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,800
I don't know.

1477
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,800
Taking a shot in the dark.

1478
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,800
Where do you know what that is going to be interpreted as?

1479
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,800
And will I stop the creative flow?

1480
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,800
Do you stop?

1481
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,800
Oh, my God.

1482
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:42,800
No.

1483
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,800
Emmy's got a hoodie here.

1484
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:44,800
Oh, sugar.

1485
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,800
I don't...

1486
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:46,800
Fucking...

1487
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,800
I put juice on her right now.

1488
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,800
I don't fucking know.

1489
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:57,800
I didn't even know what the fuck I'm doing anymore.

1490
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,800
I'm fucking dying.

1491
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,800
What is this?

1492
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,800
What is this?

1493
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,800
What is this?

1494
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,800
What?

1495
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,800
What is happening?

1496
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,800
What is this?

1497
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,800
Someone had a stroke.

1498
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,800
Could you ever do this one?

1499
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,800
Hope you're feeling OK.

1500
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:16,800
Hope you're doing all right.

1501
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,800
Make sure you hydrate.

1502
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,800
Fuck, I didn't have enough time to write it.

1503
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,800
Oh, man.

1504
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,800
How do I even draw this?

1505
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,800
This is...

1506
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,800
That's the tongue.

1507
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,800
This is literally everywhere.

1508
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,800
Wait.

1509
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,800
Okay, this is so difficult.

1510
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,800
Fuck am I drawing?

1511
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,800
I need like motion swipes as well.

1512
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,800
And a little arrow to indicate.

1513
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,800
I don't know what I'm doing.

1514
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,800
I don't know.

1515
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:03,800
Yeah, there we go.

1516
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,800
I think I drew it correctly.

1517
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:06,800
A little bit of lips.

1518
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,800
Cute?

1519
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,800
Cute?

1520
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:10,800
I don't know.

1521
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,800
I just drew anything.

1522
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,800
I don't know.

1523
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,800
I don't know what I'm doing.

1524
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,800
I just drew everything.

1525
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:18,800
What did you say?

1526
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,800
I can't wait to see the end of this.

1527
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,800
Yeah, you're all in trouble.

1528
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,800
This is going to be something else.

1529
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,800
This is going to be fucking interesting.

1530
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,800
What's going on in the ceiling?

1531
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,800
Oh, I need to draw on the ceiling quick.

1532
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,800
Oh, I think I just drew it.

1533
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,800
Oh, God.

1534
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,800
Oh, boy.

1535
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,800
I'm so scared of what these look like.

1536
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,800
Same.

1537
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,800
Are you serious?

1538
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,800
What the fuck?

1539
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:50,800
Oh, my God.

1540
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,800
I think she's beautiful.

1541
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,800
I was like, oh, you're not okay.

1542
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,800
I completely missed the book.

1543
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,800
She's fucking going.

1544
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,800
What are you doing?

1545
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:05,800
I was going to write.

1546
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:10,800
I was going to write even being cooked.

1547
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:15,800
It looked like she was on a stick that's rotating.

1548
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,800
No.

1549
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:27,800
Oh, that's why you were humming Indiana Jones.

1550
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,800
I was like, where did that come from?

1551
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,800
I was trying to write cowboy, but I didn't fit it.

1552
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,800
Oh, that's so normal.

1553
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:39,800
I'm kidding.

1554
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,800
Wait, where's my coin?

1555
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,800
Oh, my God.

1556
01:16:47,800 --> 01:17:01,800
I used the color black and I used red as well.

1557
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,800
And orange.

1558
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,800
Oh, my God.

1559
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,800
What is my one?

1560
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,800
What the fuck?

1561
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,800
I can't read.

1562
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,800
Oh, my face.

1563
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,800
Snowcow.

1564
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,800
Hey.

1565
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,800
How are you?

1566
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,800
Wait, wait, wait.

1567
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,800
Oh, my God.

1568
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,800
I used the fucking eraser.

1569
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,800
That's why you're going to fucking see it.

1570
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,800
I'm so sorry.

1571
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,800
I'm so sorry.

1572
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,800
I'm so sorry.

1573
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,800
I'm so sorry.

1574
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,800
I'm so sorry.

1575
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,800
Oh, my God.

1576
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,800
I'm so sorry.

1577
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,800
I'm sorry.

1578
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,800
How did I get back to Boob?

1579
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,800
That's not the right way to run.

1580
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,800
Oh, my God.

1581
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,800
Oh, my God.

1582
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,800
Well, actually, that potato was really bad.

1583
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,800
Never mind.

1584
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,800
Oh, wholesome.

1585
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,800
You'll learn number one.

1586
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,800
Wait, I don't know.

1587
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,800
Oh, it's not Earth 3D closer.

1588
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,800
No.

1589
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,800
Oh my god.

1590
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,800
Oh my god.

1591
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,800
Oh my god.

1592
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,800
Oh my god.

1593
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,800
Oh my god.

1594
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,800
Oh my god.

1595
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,800
Oh my god.

1596
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,800
Oh my god.

1597
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,800
Oh my god.

1598
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,800
Oh my god.

1599
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,800
Oh, this is amazing.

1600
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,800
That's what we got there.

1601
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,800
That book.

1602
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,800
Oh, they drew us.

1603
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,800
Your mom called me.

1604
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,800
Your mom called me.

1605
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,800
Oh it's sexy.

1606
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,800
That's so good.

1607
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,800
OH MY GOD.

1608
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,800
That's so sick.

1609
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,800
Oh my god.

1610
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,920
Oh, my God.

1611
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,400
My cheeks hurt from this moment.

1612
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,360
Same.

1613
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,360
My jaw hurts.

1614
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:11,680
Oh, okay, okay.

1615
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:12,520
Ah!

1616
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,360
Ah!

1617
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,180
Ah!

1618
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:17,020
Ah!

1619
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:17,860
Ah!

1620
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:18,700
Ah!

1621
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:19,520
Ah!

1622
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,360
Ah!

1623
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,200
Ah!

1624
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,020
Ah!

1625
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:22,860
Ah!

1626
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:23,700
Ah!

1627
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:24,520
Ah!

1628
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,360
Ah!

1629
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,200
Ah!

1630
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,020
Ah!

1631
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:27,860
Ah!

1632
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:28,700
Ah!

1633
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:29,520
Ah!

1634
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,360
Ah!

1635
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,640
Oh, by a train!

1636
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:32,640
Oh, my God.

1637
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,480
Oh!

1638
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:34,320
Oh!

1639
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,160
Oh!

1640
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:36,000
Oh!

1641
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:36,840
Oh!

1642
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,520
Somebody download that one.

1643
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,640
Oh, my God.

1644
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,280
That's fucking amazing.

1645
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,120
Oh!

1646
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:47,200
That's so fucking funny.

1647
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,040
I love this.

1648
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,880
What a guy's permission.

1649
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,440
That train.

1650
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,040
That train is bad.

1651
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,080
It's not the premium pass.

1652
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:56,920
That is bad.

1653
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,000
It's not the premium pass.

1654
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,640
As you see at the convention,

1655
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,080
they got the premium pass.

1656
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,100
That train.

1657
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:03,940
Me.

1658
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:04,760
Me.

1659
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,580
Hahaha!

1660
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:08,600
Tag yourself on the ropes.

1661
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:12,060
Tying me to the tracks.

1662
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:13,120
Oh, my God.

1663
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:13,940
Oh, my God.

1664
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:14,780
Holy shit.

1665
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:16,200
I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna

1666
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,240
endure the girls to anything more

1667
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:19,800
because like, our faces are ready

1668
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,620
to fall off after that.

1669
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:24,680
Is anyone doing a stream?

1670
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:25,520
Me, I am.

1671
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,340
Is anyone?

1672
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:27,380
Are you doing a stream?

1673
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:28,220
No.

1674
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,900
I need to pee really bad.

1675
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:30,400
Right.

1676
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:34,900
I'm going to jump out of the call.

1677
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,540
And I'm going to jump out of the call.

1678
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,980
Man, now I'm sick of my new piss off.

1679
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:39,480
I know.

1680
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:39,980
I know.

1681
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:42,140
Let's win it.

1682
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:44,860
I am going to jump out of the call

1683
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:45,940
and do a little satsuthe.

1684
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:48,620
And I'll redirect into Yuzuru, OK?

1685
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:49,120
OK.

1686
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,820
I'm going to be in Stardil.

1687
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:52,620
OK.

1688
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:53,540
I might play.

1689
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:54,420
Do you guys want me?

1690
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,180
I might play some Call of the Lamb.

1691
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:59,220
If someone does a pop-up stream, just tell me.

1692
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:01,100
I'll talk to my reef ones for a bit.

1693
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:03,900
Thank you so, so much, all members and dolls,

1694
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,620
for this hilarity that ensued after such a miserable start.

1695
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:07,460
This was amazing.

1696
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:11,980
The art that such a miserable start to power water.

1697
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:14,300
Shat myself for laughing so hard.

1698
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,020
Oh, no.

1699
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:18,100
We already know Aces panties are soaked.

1700
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:20,940
So let's not laugh.

1701
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:22,460
And Amy, probably?

1702
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:23,860
No.

1703
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:25,860
No.

1704
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:26,460
All right.

1705
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:27,620
Let me sniff.

1706
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:30,100
Let me sniff test.

1707
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,980
Don't do the sniff test.

1708
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:33,540
Rather pungent, my dear.

1709
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,500
My bridge just cut out.

1710
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:36,580
You have to take a test.

1711
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:40,580
Like she just disintegrated.

1712
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:42,780
Oh, my god.

1713
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:43,180
Right.

1714
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:44,380
I'm going to jump out of chat.

1715
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:45,060
Thank you so much.

1716
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:46,220
OK, OK, OK.

1717
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:48,700
We'll be doing collabs next week with each other.

1718
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,180
So look out for that.

1719
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:52,220
And I'll jump out of chat.

1720
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:53,180
Thank you so much.

1721
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,580
My darlings, my daughters, my girls.

1722
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:57,340
I'll talk to you very shortly, OK?

1723
01:21:57,340 --> 01:21:58,540
I'm off to the refunds.

1724
01:21:58,540 --> 01:21:59,580
I love you, my daughters.

1725
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:02,980
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

1726
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:06,060
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

1727
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,900
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

1728
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:11,700
OK, all these girls.

1729
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:14,180
These are the yellow girl.

1730
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:17,140
Yeah.

1731
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:19,220
They're so cute, right?

1732
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:21,660
You know, you're still in call.

1733
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:23,980
That was really something.

1734
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,700
Wait, are you guys still streaming?

1735
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:27,540
Yeah, I am.

1736
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:28,420
I am, yeah.

1737
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:30,260
I don't know what to do.

1738
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:32,260
I feel like I lost my ability to stream.

1739
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:33,620
You got to go off.

1740
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:34,540
OK, let's go off.

1741
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:38,140
Go to Jeff Channing and then raid into Azra.

1742
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:40,100
I think Azra's next, right?

1743
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:40,980
Yeah, I'm going to be.

1744
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:42,420
I'll see you, but.

1745
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,260
Me and Azra are going to be streaming.

1746
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:45,380
She's doing Stardew.

1747
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:47,300
I'm doing Call of the Limb.

1748
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:48,420
Wait, wait.

1749
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:51,500
So Shibi and Azra are going to stream right now?

1750
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,660
Yeah, I'm going to keep streaming.

1751
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,580
I'm probably going to end this one

1752
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:59,020
so that the bot is separated.

1753
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:01,780
Oh, yeah, actually, I'll end it.

1754
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:04,020
We can do one.

1755
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:09,100
OK, hang up and then I'll go to the just chatting

1756
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:10,380
and then I'll send.

1757
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:12,180
I'll check if y'all ready.

1758
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:15,020
OK, let me just go.

1759
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:16,900
Bye bye.

1760
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:18,940
Bye bye.

1761
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:19,780
Bye bye.

1762
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:23,260
Hey, guys, that was that was fun.

1763
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:26,380
I'm going to we're going to do a early stream

1764
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:28,300
because why not?

1765
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:31,100
Since I'm already streaming, I was going to take a break,

1766
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:32,620
but that was really fast.

1767
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:36,700
I like in between.

1768
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:37,620
I'm so sorry.

1769
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:40,420
I wasn't talking much.

1770
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:43,700
I'm trying to find the group calling you to get rid of that.

1771
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:44,500
I'm so sorry.

1772
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,460
I wasn't talking much.

1773
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:47,420
I'm so sorry.

1774
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:50,620
I wasn't talking much.

1775
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:53,140
I wasn't talking very much.

1776
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:56,060
I spent the majority of it laughing too hard.

1777
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:03,820
I was laughing too hard the entire time.

1778
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:06,100
OK, I'm going to end this bot.

1779
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,500
OK, in this video, I'm never going

1780
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,140
to start up the stardo stream.

1781
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:13,220
OK, so I'll see you guys in just a few minutes.

1782
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:13,740
Sorry.

1783
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:20,460
We'll be streaming pretty much all day.

1784
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:28,740
At least you got plenty of talk for the next stream.

1785
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:29,260
Yeah.

1786
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:33,540
Yeah.

1787
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:36,140
OK, bye bye, everyone.

1788
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:37,180
That was fun.

1789
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:40,260
See you in a few, in a few minutes.

1790
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:42,140
Bye.

1791
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:43,180
Bye.
