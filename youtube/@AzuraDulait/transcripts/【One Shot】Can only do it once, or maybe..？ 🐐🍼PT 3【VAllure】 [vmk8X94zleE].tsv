458280	462560	ʀk ʀ�कᦀ ʀ� mondo ʏ detailed how
462560	476000	mine decided to make toast yeah i think i was sleeping when this happened i don't remember where i was
476000	487520	i just know i was in my room i was in my room i was in my room having a good time doing whatever
487600	494800	i was doing aki but then all of a sudden i smelled something it smelled
497280	501520	it smelled like fire fire where's that smoke
504080	509920	what's that what what i gotta go check it out
509920	522800	so i get up and i open my door and then a huge cloud of gray smoke fills my room
523600	526720	the entire ceiling is covered in smoke
529200	537600	the entire ceiling is covered in smoke and i had to bend down and walk all the way to the kitchen
538240	540000	to see what the heck happened
545760	553920	i go into the the the kitchen and there my sibling is coming out of their room at the same time
554560	561680	and we we both walk in there together and i'm like what the heck's going on why is there smoke
561760	567120	what's going on and they were like i was making toast
570480	577280	we're like toast that's the toaster and then we go in there and then there's more smoke
578480	585120	spewing out of the toaster spewing out of the toaster
585200	597120	so for like a couple of years before this incident our toaster was actually broken
598080	605040	it was broken for like a couple of years every time you push the toaster down every now and then
605680	612720	the button doesn't come back up so the toaster would stay on even if the timer was over
612800	615840	it didn't pop pop pop back up so
618720	624640	it was like rule of thumb not to leave the toaster when when you make toast but
625440	631520	i think in between the time it was broken and the incident it was working for a little bit
632800	639520	so my sibling left the toaster alone with the toast and forgot about it
643040	654640	so yeah um when uh when we got to the toaster
659920	666480	we got to the toaster um my sibling popped the toaster out
667440	674000	popped the toast out and it was black like charred like it looked like charcoal
674800	681120	it looked like burning charcoal the center was a little like little grayish but it was
681760	686880	like it looked like magma in the center like in the very very center it looked like
687520	694720	it was like bubbling and popping in the center of the of the toast of the now charcoal bread
696880	704320	it was it was it was like bubbling and popping my my my sibling took it out with a like
705200	711680	they tried to use their like hand and it was too hot so they used an oven mat
713200	719920	and they pulled it out with the oven mat and then the oven mat caught fire yeah
726480	729920	so
739200	741920	and we haven't had a toaster since
748720	749680	no toaster
750240	751120	okay
755120	758480	let me add a toaster oven i'm not really sure what happened to that one
760080	765120	it just disappeared i went in there one day to make me a toaster and it was gone
769360	776160	so we don't own a toaster or a toaster oven but someone got us a toaster on throw now
776160	783360	so yay we'll we'll have a toaster i'll have a toaster again i can make toast normally
789200	789600	yay
794000	798480	make sure no fires occur i'll just i'll just keep the toaster in my room
798800	805280	i don't want my sibling to come asking to make toast
807840	814880	i think the reason why the old toaster broke was because people forced it to pop you know how you
814880	821680	push the pop button up and it will pop um not a lot of toasters are designed to do that
823040	823920	so i think
824320	832400	i think uh i think they broke it by doing that so i'm afraid of of leaving the new one in there
832400	835360	and them doing that again
843120	852160	so they um and broke it perfect the toaster i have molts and hot toast yeah it's not the first time
852240	857280	it's not the first time we had a fire though yeah we had a fire a couple of times
858400	860560	um in this house in this house

4441500	4443500	I can't see her.
4443500	4446500	Yes.
4446500	4449500	She made me pancakes.
4449500	4453500	What?
4453500	4459500	I think it was my birthday.
4459500	4466500	Because people always get their favorite food on their birthdays.
4466500	4481500	I remember my birthdays, they sucked really badly.
4481500	4485500	I get a little emotional when it comes to birthdays.
4485500	4492500	My birthday was always forgotten.
4492500	4502500	My birthday was forgotten for 3-4 years straight in a row.
4502500	4514500	A whole lot of it.
4514500	4517500	Do you have a birthday?
4517500	4519500	I do.
4519500	4524500	It's August 21st.
4524500	4532500	August 24th.
4532500	4535500	Oh, accidentally.
4535500	4542500	Where's that?
4542500	4544500	Yes, I do.
4544500	4547500	Oh, then what's your favorite food?
4547500	4549500	Is it pancakes?
4549500	4552500	Wait, do you like pancakes?
4552500	4554500	I do.
4554500	4557500	Yes, me too.
4557500	4561500	On my last birthday, I ate two of them.
4561500	4562500	So many.
4562500	4566500	I was so full I didn't eat anything else that day.
4566500	4570500	But you're telling her, be careful.
4570500	4578500	It's so much, you're telling her.
4578500	4580500	We won't regret it.
4580500	4582500	I hope you won't.
4582500	4584500	Thank you.
4584500	4588500	Thank you everyone.
4588500	4590500	You have it on your calendar.
4590500	4593500	Yay.
4593500	4601500	Yeah, no birthday for 3 years.
4601500	4611500	Yes, it's my day of creation.
4611500	4615500	My mama makes the best packets.
4615500	4618500	And some of the neighbors make really good noodles.
4618500	4622500	My mom made the best oatmeal.
4622500	4631500	It was mostly my grandma's oatmeal.
4631500	4634500	She made it with absolute love.
4634500	4636500	I don't know how she did it.
4636500	4641500	We don't know what her secret ingredient was and we'll never know.
4641500	4646500	All we can do is experiment and see if we can get it to taste the same.
4646500	4650500	There's just no way we can ever get it to taste the same.
4650500	4655500	So my mom's oatmeal came in second.
4655500	4660500	It was close, very close enough to it.
4660500	4675500	It was my favorite food that she would make.
4675500	4681500	Oh, one of our neighbors makes a lot of bread.
4681500	4690500	Bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread.
4690500	4692500	Do you have any neighbors?
4692500	4694500	Yeah, they're kind of them.
4694500	4695500	They're great.
4695500	4701500	I like my neighbors so much.
4701500	4703500	Good neighbors.
4703500	4711500	Well, one of them is actually a really, really good neighbor.
4711500	4713500	She's a sweetheart.
4713500	4717500	A really, really old lady.
4717500	4720500	Really, really old lady.
4720500	4723500	Sweetheart.
4723500	4725500	Yes.
4725500	4728500	Oh, do they share their food with you?
4728500	4731500	She used to, not anymore.
4731500	4745500	Now she comes over and asks if we have sugar to lend or a roll of toilet paper.
4745500	4747500	I guess I'll say no.
4747500	4751500	It's been years since then, since we last shared.
4751500	4754500	We're the ones that share food with her now.
4754500	4765500	Whenever we have big events and stuff, we'll make a supper plate for her and give it to her.
4765500	4770500	Such as I know her, yes.
4770500	4774500	Since it's an occasional thing and she doesn't share food with us.
4774500	4776500	We share food with her.
4785500	4787500	Yeah, they say no.
4787500	4789500	They say no.
4789500	4791500	It's not very nice of them.
4791500	4795500	It's true.
4795500	4801500	Our neighbors and my mama take turns making food at the whole village each day.
4801500	4803500	That's sweet.
4803500	4810500	Aw.
4811500	4814500	I still tell a little white lie.
4814500	4816500	Nah.
4816500	4817500	I tell the truth.
4817500	4823500	I'm really actually really bad at telling lies.
4823500	4826500	It's not my forte.
4826500	4828500	But I do like trolling.
4828500	4833500	It's my favorite thing to do.
4833500	4846500	I'm not really good at lying, but I do like trolling.
4846500	4850500	Everyone also takes turns doing chores and watching the little kids.
4850500	4858500	It sounds like a very nice village.
4858500	4861500	I don't need to be watched anymore though.
4861500	4863500	I'm old enough to help out.
4863500	4866500	Yeah, you are. You're a big boy now.
4866500	4868500	Big boy Nico.
4868500	4870500	You're a big boy.
4870500	4872500	You are so cute.
4875500	4877500	I miss everyone.
4882500	4884500	Aw.
4885500	4888500	I've been gone for a while now, haven't I?
4888500	4891500	I wonder if they're worried about me.
4891500	4896500	Speaking of helping out, I should probably go now.
4896500	4898500	Right.
4898500	4900500	Do I have to take a nap?
4902500	4904500	How do you run again?
4904500	4905500	Yeah.
4905500	4906500	Alright.
4906500	4910500	So where I left off, I was trying to figure out how do you...
4910500	4915500	Oh yeah, I need scissors.
4919500	4924500	Where get scissors?
4924500	4927500	Wait, this is a bakery, right?
4927500	4929500	This is like a cafe.
4932500	4938500	I need scissors to, I think, cut the tape.
4938500	4942500	But where the heck do you get scissors from?
4948500	4950500	Okay.
4962500	4965500	Probably I'm missing something.
4978500	4980500	Oh.
4991500	4994500	Does this person do anything?
4994500	4997500	Like, do I, like, give her something?
5004500	5007500	No, I think I already tried that.
5009500	5014500	I'm not very good at lying.
5014500	5032500	Then you're probably going to answer the personality quiz and mystery dungeon, honestly.
5032500	5034500	Most likely.
5038500	5040500	Okay.
5059500	5063500	Where the heck do you get scissors from?
5063500	5065500	Wait a minute.
5069500	5072500	I think I saw an extra room. Was it an extra room?
5072500	5075500	Is this the library?
5075500	5078500	Yeah, that one was this room, I know.
5078500	5082500	I saw a hallway or something.
5082500	5084500	This.
5084500	5086500	Oh!
5086500	5089500	A room I haven't been in!
5092500	5094500	Scissors.
5094500	5096500	The pair of scissors on the ground.
5096500	5098500	A pile of hair.
5098500	5101500	I don't think anyone's using this anymore.
5111500	5113500	The sink.
5115500	5117500	Soap dispenser.
5120500	5122500	I found scissors.

5226500	5228500	Oh, of course.
5228500	5230500	I had to tape it together or it might fall apart.

5286500	5288500	The scores have happened all the time.
5289500	5292500	I meant the whole security code thing.
5292500	5295500	But then again, the elevator hasn't been as broken before.
5295500	5296500	Hmm.
5296500	5300500	I guess we should go look for a code, is there a?
5300500	5302500	Yeah, let's go look for a code.
5302500	5304500	I broke it.
5307500	5309500	Security code to continue.
5309500	5310500	Oh.
5312500	5313500	Access denied.
5313500	5315500	Can I help with anything?
5315500	5316500	Anyhow.
5316500	5318500	Things are unproductive for so long.
5318500	5320500	It's really...
5325500	5326500	Thank you.
5326500	5328500	Thank you so much.
5328500	5331500	I'm going to head out for the five dollar tip.
5331500	5333500	Thank you, thank you.
5334500	5335500	What?
5335500	5337500	Yeah, they're super jealous.
5340500	5343500	They want a piece of this bread and they can't have it.
5343500	5344500	Sorry.
5345500	5347500	It's really getting to me.
5347500	5350500	I think it's Zora and I got an handle.
5350500	5352500	What do you think, Zora?
5357500	5359500	It's on the standard.
5359500	5361500	It's on these random codes.
5361500	5366500	Maybe you could just try out some numbers until you get it?
5366500	5370500	Alright, I suppose that's better than doing nothing.
5370500	5371500	Let's see.
5373500	5375500	Yep, gonna be here for a while.
5378500	5381500	You aren't seriously doing this, are you?
5389500	5392500	Which way was it to that door?
5393500	5395500	Oh, it's upright.
5396500	5398500	I think I have to get it from up here.
5401500	5404500	Wait, should I go check on plant?
5404500	5405500	Plant lady?
5405500	5407500	Is plant lady okay?
5409500	5411500	I have access...
5412500	5415500	I have the code from last time, I think, do I?
5417500	5418500	Do I?
5424500	5426500	I do! You're right!
5426500	5428500	I do, I do, I do.
5431500	5433500	Is she okay?
5433500	5435500	Alright, she's okay.
5436500	5438500	Yeah, the film, the film!
5438500	5440500	The film!
5440500	5464500	It was 6304.
5464500	5466500	6304.
5466500	5469500	I'm gonna move myself out of the way a little more.
5469500	5471500	No?
5471500	5473500	Yeah.
5502500	5505500	Can't find him.
5512500	5514500	Hang on one moment.
5516500	5517500	Hit.
5517500	5518500	Hit.
5518500	5520500	Oh my goodness.
5525500	5527500	6304.
5531500	5533500	What?
5547500	5549500	Yeah.
5549500	5550500	What?
5550500	5552500	It works!
5552500	5555500	I don't know what you did, but it actually works.
5555500	5557500	Good job, Kat.
5557500	5559500	You're a genius, you know that?
5559500	5561500	And I hope for Missouri, too.
5564500	5566500	I think, I think...
5566500	5568500	Oh, right.
5568500	5570500	The whole Messiah business.
5570500	5572500	Anyway, ready to go?
5572500	5573500	Bye bye.
5574500	5575500	Wait.
5582500	5584500	Doesn't he do one last thing here?
5590500	5592500	Don't be afraid to ask if you're hungry.
5592500	5595500	I don't get a pancake or a Nikko.
5595500	5598500	I thought I got a pancake for a Nikko.
5598500	5602500	I think I hear my door.
5602500	5604500	Hang on, I hear my door.
5604500	5606500	Give me one second.
5606500	5608500	Give me one second, give me one second.
5608500	5610500	Hang on, I hear my door.
5610500	5611500	Give me one second.
5611500	5613500	Give me one second, give me one second.
5638500	5640500	No, that wasn't my door.
5640500	5642500	That was just someone else out there.
5643500	5645500	I got tricked.
5647500	5649500	I was tricked.
5653500	5655500	I was tricked.
5658500	5660500	I was tricked.

5662500	5664500	I was tricked.
5664500	5666500	I was tricked.
5666500	5668500	I was tricked.
5668500	5670500	I was tricked.
5672500	5674500	Oh, hey. Welcome back.
5675500	5677500	That shirt took you a while, huh?
5677500	5679500	Oh shoot, you've been waiting this whole time.
5679500	5681500	I wasn't gone that long!
5683500	5685500	And holding the door open.
5685500	5687500	Well, I don't want to be rude.
5687500	5689500	I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that, god!
5689500	5691500	I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that, god!
5691500	5693500	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
5693500	5695500	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
5697500	5699500	Oh no!
5699500	5701500	I wasn't gone that long.
5701500	5703500	I just walked away for a tiny bit.

6026400	6034080	most of the city's stuff. Oh, we used to have a small army of delivery robots doing that, but
6034800	6042640	lately a bunch of them have been breaking down. So until they fix them, I'll just have more work on
6042640	6051600	my plate, and it's left into long. When will the robots get fixed? I have no idea. It's all up to the
6051600	6058400	scientists over at the labs, but they seem really concerned about something else lately. Oh,
6059840	6068640	never a good sign when even the smart folks are worried. All right, Zora, should I ask about the city?
6071200	6079040	The city is very big. It's smaller than it looks. Dang, this whole conversation while we're going
6079040	6093840	to the floor. We must be really high up. I knew you here. Welcome in. Nice to see you,
6094480	6097040	but I'm very sure I've seen you before.
6097040	6113680	I love to be trapped in an elevator with a Zora with you. I might ravish you.
6113680	6128720	Good evening, Muldor. Good evening.
6132640	6138160	Getting pretty crowded too. First there was the refugees from the barrens, and now more
6138320	6147840	women folks are moving into. Oh, it's a safer here, you know? I mean, it's not a haven by any means.
6148800	6154160	That square stuff that we just saw, we have more of that here than anywhere else apparently,
6154720	6162080	I noticed. We're lucky it only seems to affect the city's infrastructures. The land mass
6162720	6170400	itself is still holding up, which is good since there isn't much solid land here in the first place.
6174080	6182880	All right, how's Zora? Should I ask about the library? Can you tell me about the library?
6184080	6189600	I'm supposed to go there. Oh yeah, that's one of my main delivery spots.
6190560	6194000	Those reading lights are pretty high maintenance.
6195680	6201520	Well, I just feel out of place surrounded by smart people. Well, here's just pretty smart
6201520	6208720	yourself, so you'll fit in line, you and Zora. I'm dumb. I don't know what he's talking about.
6210640	6218800	I mean, no, I'm smart. I am so smart. I am intelligent. I am the brightest person ever.
6219600	6221840	I am intelligent.
6234960	6237760	Anyway, it was a nice meeting you.
6242000	6245200	Right, see you around. Good, good around now.
6250160	6257200	I guess we should hurry too. Zora, people are counting on us. Yeah, let's go find that library.
6263120	6265680	Amos the robot. Beep boop. Beep boop.
6268320	6269600	Suspicious person.
6272000	6278320	Suspicious person, sigh. You all right? Uh, what was I at? Perhaps this is a sigh.
6280080	6286080	Tell me, do you think you could fix the world with the sun? Honestly, I don't know.
6286880	6293120	I've been getting mixed messages. I know. But what do you think? I think.
6293920	6298400	I think I should listen to Zora. After all, Zora helped me get this far.
6299360	6304800	That'll take your faith or an answer then. What do you mean by that? It means what
6304800	6306800	you think it means.
6325120	6327520	Strage man. Strage man.
6334800	6336800	Strage man.
6364800	6372800	It's fine. It's fine. I'm really scared.
6394800	6410800	Oh, the business gave me so bad a heart. It hurt me so bad. It gave me, oh my god.
6425200	6432160	I was so unprepared for that. My chest hurt for a second. It hurt for a split second.
6433760	6434800	I'm fine.
6440400	6445920	Zora, did you see what happened? Yeah, my vision went blank for a second.
6445920	6451200	And then I saw something, like a really short dream. I don't know what that was about.
6455200	6457200	Strage man. Strage man.
6463440	6464240	What's up here?
6470640	6471680	Another alleyway?
6474880	6476880	Why should I check out over here first?
6476880	6487520	It's a faded flyer. It's a faded flyer.
6492080	6495200	I'm curious and marking on the ball. Looks like a round.
6496160	6496640	He-ee.
6499840	6500640	What's down here?
6503360	6505840	This is strangely warm in this room.
6511760	6517840	Oh, a cat. Are you lost? Me? Do you wish to join us?
6518720	6526720	I want to be with the cats. I want this. It's not fair. I want this. This I want. I want.
6535840	6538720	I want this. I want this.
6539120	6551040	Join your cats? Yes. But I'm not a cat. I don't walk on far likes like they do.
6551920	6558960	You have cat eyes? My eyes are normal, people eyes. Well, I'm normal back home.
6559840	6566320	You're how to shoot like a cat. But I'm just a person. You're still welcome here.
6567200	6574400	I protect lost people as well. Thanks. No, not lost though. You got a sword to guide me. I see.
6577440	6581440	Why must our cat map? The cats are cute.
6581440	6607920	Oh, please. Do not approach.
6611520	6611920	Oh.
6616080	6618880	Oh, not going in there. Not yet.
6622240	6626960	What's up here? Oh, not going in there. What's up here?
6629520	6638640	What's this? The bag has some big plastic disc here. Looks like they're supposed to go in something.
6639600	6645760	Wait, is there are really going to take these with us? They look so heavy. All right.
6647360	6655680	They're actually pretty light. It's a big book. The title says understanding robots.
6658160	6666720	An empty glass jar with water handle. A bed. The blanket has quite a few patches.
6668640	6681120	I don't know if I can see. There's some broken glass in there. Big coffee cups.
6683680	6685520	A lantern plant. Hang on. I need to
6688560	6693360	put cream on my wrist. My wrist is starting to
6694080	6705840	hurt.

8199160	8200160	Just now
8226480	8228760	I got a rather calm heart, right?
8230160	8232160	Come for now
8232160	8235160	But my issue with my heart rate is that it goes
8235160	8239160	It becomes too slow
8239160	8242160	So the numbers are dipping
8242160	8244160	Don't be concerned
8244160	8246160	It's fine
8246160	8248160	I might feel a little faint
8248160	8249160	But I just need to relax
8249160	8250160	That's all
8250160	8253160	Not the only thing you'll probably notice
8253160	8256160	Is it dipping
8256160	8258160	If it goes any higher
8258160	8263160	It's probably because I took my medication
8263160	8267160	My medication sometimes makes my heart rate go a little high
8282160	8286160	Yeah, the heart rate monitor takes time to go up
8286160	8288160	It doesn't go up right away
8288160	8290160	So when I got scared it
8290160	8294160	It definitely went up to like 70-something
8294160	8299160	But it takes time to read the heart
8299160	8301160	Promise you'll be okay
8301160	8304160	I'm fine, I'll be okay
8309160	8311160	They don't taste too bad though
8311160	8313160	Do you want one?
8313160	8315160	It's okay, thank you
8317160	8319160	Hey, hey
8319160	8322160	Ready for me to blow your mind?
8322160	8324160	Yeah, okay, so
8324160	8327160	I've invented a machine, a medicine
8327160	8330160	To prepare everyone for the upcoming water shortage
8330160	8334160	All you gotta do is dissolve one of these pills in water
8334160	8336160	Then you drink the water
8336160	8339160	Then you never need to drink water again
8339160	8340160	What?
8340160	8343160	It also makes plants grow faster
8343160	8345160	How does it work?
8345160	8348160	Here, why don't you take a free sample?
8348160	8350160	Oh, thanks

8443160	8447160	The library is up ahead.
8448160	8455160	When the world ends, would it be better if it was gone and an instant are slowly fading away?
8455160	8457160	An instant.
8457160	8469160	If I were to witness the world perishing, I would rather it be spontaneous.
8469160	8471160	Boom!
8471160	8473160	It's fast.
8473160	8475160	Boom!
8475160	8477160	It's fun.
8477160	8479160	I feel a thing.
8479160	8481160	Boom!
8481160	8489160	To be honest, I'd rather the former.
8489160	8497160	Anything over here?
8497160	8503160	But in all honesty, I don't want it to end.
8503160	8505160	Or do I?
8505160	8507160	No, I don't want it to end.
8507160	8509160	I don't want it to end.
8509160	8513160	Oh, we're in the library.
8513160	8515160	It's a little bridge bridge.
8515160	8517160	It's a box by the box.
8517160	8519160	Some sort of something.
8519160	8521160	I have a person with white hair.
8521160	8523160	I like your hair.
8523160	8525160	What?
8525160	8527160	Well, I didn't say anything.
8527160	8529160	Stop staring at me, then.
8529160	8531160	I was looking at your book.
8531160	8533160	Yes, you're in the library.
8533160	8537160	There's books in the library.
8537160	8541160	Go bug the chatty one upstairs.
8541160	8545160	Others books covered a wide range of topics.
8545160	8549160	It seems there are no subjects.
8549160	8551160	It is not right.
8551160	8553160	Right about.
8555160	8557160	Quite the renaissance, man.
8557160	8559160	What do you think?
8559160	8561160	I hate this brace.
8561160	8563160	It makes my wrist so itchy.
8563160	8565160	I guess so.
8565160	8567160	But he's been focusing on documenting the world.
8567160	8569160	As a boy.
8569160	8571160	Oh?
8571160	8573160	Is it a city that's the last...
8573160	8575160	Beixion?
8575160	8577160	Beixion?
8577160	8579160	As a boy.
8579160	8581160	Is it a city that's the last...
8581160	8583160	Beixion?
8583160	8585160	Beixion?
8585160	8587160	Observation?

8589160	8591160	Beison?
8591160	8593160	Beison?
8603160	8605160	Some of these books
8605160	8607160	may be the only thing
8607160	8609160	we have to remember
8609160	8611160	the rest of the world.
8613160	8615160	But our goddess wouldn't let that happen.
8615160	8617160	The world ending?
8617160	8619160	I'll do my best,
8619160	8621160	but I could barely
8621160	8623160	I could
8623160	8625160	I could barely stop a war.
8629160	8631160	I like lost a lot of my
8631160	8633160	my powers.
8635160	8637160	I'm not as strong as I used to be.
8643160	8645160	I'm not as strong as I used to be.
8647160	8649160	Sorry, I barely could stop a war.
8649160	8651160	I don't think I could stop the world from ending.

8673160	8675160	Beis-ti-on?
8683160	8685160	I prefer instant death.
8685160	8687160	Yes.
8687160	8689160	Yes.
8689160	8691160	Yes.
8691160	8693160	Beis-ti-on?
8693160	8695160	Ah.
8703160	8705160	Oh, hello. Do you need directions?
8705160	8707160	Let's see. This area here
8707160	8709160	is mostly historical accounts.
8709160	8711160	The reference section
8711160	8713160	is downstairs.
8713160	8715160	I'm not sure where the children's section is.
8715160	8717160	It's okay.
8717160	8719160	I'm not really looking for books.
8719160	8721160	I'm looking to look for
8721160	8723160	the author then.
8723160	8725160	Oh, that's good.
8725160	8727160	I mean
8727160	8729160	that means you won't be disappointed
8729160	8731160	when volunteering here
8731160	8733160	for months and I've never seen him.
8733160	8735160	I haven't once.
8735160	8737160	It works together with the head librarian
8737160	8739160	on publishing.
8739160	8741160	So you'd think he would at least
8741160	8743160	show up once in a while.
8743160	8745160	But
8745160	8747160	he doesn't?
8747160	8749160	He seems kind of
8749160	8751160	kind of
8751160	8753160	reclusive.
8755160	8757160	Which is weird
8757160	8759160	for a guy who supposedly
8759160	8761160	travels for it.
8761160	8763160	Maybe it's just around people.
8765160	8767160	Let me by.
8767160	8769160	Let me in.
8769160	8771160	Computer, it's currently all.
8773160	8775160	Let's over here.
8775160	8777160	Robot.
8777160	8779160	Oh, person.
8779160	8781160	Hi.
8781160	8783160	Reselving in progress.
8783160	8785160	Please watch out
8785160	8787160	for potential
8787160	8789160	following books.
8789160	8791160	I will.
8791160	8793160	Still scared of ladders.
8805160	8807160	Oh.
8815160	8817160	You know what I forgot to do today?
8817160	8819160	Before stream.
8821160	8823160	It was something I forgot to do today.
8827160	8829160	I forgot.
8829160	8831160	I completely forgot.
8831160	8833160	I forgot to say on twitter
8833160	8835160	that I was live.
8843160	8845160	Oops.
8845160	8847160	I react.
8857160	8859160	Butter late than ever.
8859160	8861160	Yeah, let's do that right now.
8863160	8865160	We'll be live for a little while.
8879160	8881160	It's almost hibernation time.
8883160	8885160	One day I'm going to sleep
8885160	8887160	for like 13 hours.
8887160	8889160	So.
8889160	8891160	Ready for it.
8893160	8895160	Oh.
8895160	8897160	Ow.
8897160	8899160	I hit my head.
8899160	8901160	I feel like.
8901160	8903160	My horn is hit.
8903160	8905160	Hit the microphone.
8917160	8919160	I was just trying to stretch.
8921160	8923160	I just wanted to stretch.
8947160	8949160	Okie är.

9357460	9361460	No. I just saw it in a movie once.
9361460	9365460	About superheroes and stuff.
9365460	9371460	You're going through these pages pretty fast.
9371460	9374460	Actually, it's mostly pictures.
9374460	9378460	Oh? Yeah. Oh, that doesn't only write books.
9378460	9380460	It also illustrates them.

9413460	9415460	Fust for shrimp.
9415460	9418460	Also known as seed shrimp.
9418460	9424460	And certain vernaculars due to the shape of their transparent coat.
9424460	9430460	These aquatic invertebrates are the most abundant life form
9430460	9433460	in the oceans surrounding the barrens.
9434460	9439460	Common firefly.
9439460	9443460	Nocturnal beetle with a vibrant glow,
9443460	9448460	sometimes captured and messed and put in jars
9448460	9453460	to be used as living lamps by the Glen's residents.
9453460	9457460	This has inspired the now common practice
9457460	9462460	of using phosphor shrimps to do the same.
9462460	9468460	That made me light-headed.
9493460	9498460	I can't help but laugh.
9498460	9503460	I can't help but laugh.
9503460	9508460	I can't help but laugh.

9532460	9536460	Undertailed by host of this game so far.
9536460	9539460	Somewhat, yeah, I can see it.
9543460	9545460	Book reading is smart.
9545460	9549460	Using that voice really kind of...
9549460	9552460	It's because I can't take breaths in between,
9552460	9555460	like proper breaths.
9555460	9558460	And my lungs aren't so great.
9561460	9565460	So when I read in that voice,
9565460	9568460	it's hard to take a breath.
9568460	9573460	The author's latest books are really something, yeah?
9574460	9579460	Oh, that librarian just released a bunch last week.

9802580	9825580	As a general rule, if a phosphorous loses its glow entirely, it cannot be re-lit unless exposed to the sun.
9826580	9836580	If the phosphor is merely dim, it may be possible to boost it through exposure through another phosphor of higher energy.
9839580	9846580	But even so, the boosted phosphor will never return to its original brightness.
9856580	9862580	Chapter 5. A survey of phosphors found in the natural world.
9863580	9869580	Chapter 6. Blue Phosphor Location
9869580	9887580	Blue Phosphor is of moderate levels of energy. It can exist in both organic and mineral forms.
9888580	9895580	A mineral form is most commonly found in the metallic sound of the parents.
9896580	9905580	The organic form is most commonly found in phosphor strength and in secretions.
9906580	9920580	Although the light emission of blue phosphor is powerful, it has what I would describe as self-conserving properties.
9920580	9935580	That is to say, the glow may not be constant. Most forms of blue phosphor will stop glowing if left undisturbed for long periods of time.
9935580	9954580	If using blue phosphor to perform machines, a motor should be set at a baseline level of activity to ensure constant agitation of the phosphor. Alternatively, live phosphors from can be used.
9955580	9962580	Chapter 7. Green Phosphor Location
9962580	9978580	Green Phosphor is one of the highest energy. It is almost the rarest of the common phosphor as it can only be found in organic form.
9978580	9987580	The known sources include the sap of phosphor trees, fireflies, and various mosses.
9987580	10012580	Although this phosphor is present in a... uh oh, what word is that? Apoquitas grounds covering moss in the glen. It is only a minute or months and almost impossible to concentrate.
10012580	10026580	Green Phosphor is ideal or industrial use, however, due to its relative scarcity and past over-arvesting.
10026580	10038580	And there is currently no reliable source. Thankfully, at least locals of the glen still have enough to get by.
10039580	10041580	Ubiquitas.
10042580	10044580	Ubiquitas?
10045580	10048580	What a strange word. Ubiquitas.
10051580	10055580	English is silly. And there it is.
10056580	10065580	I'm a little bit eeby. I think you guys already noticed. I'm a little bit eeby.
10069580	10071580	No.

10118220	10130220	There's nothing you can do this time.
10148220	10161220	I'm fine.
10161220	10166220	I didn't fall asleep now.
10166220	10168220	I didn't.
10169220	10178220	There's nothing you can do this time.
10178220	10188220	There's nothing you can do this time.

10217220	10225220	There's nothing you can do this time.
10225220	10232220	Out of the common phosphorus, red phosphorus is the lowest energy.
10232220	10243220	It exists exclusively in mineral form and can only give light when in solution.
10243220	10263220	There's nothing you can do this time.
10263220	10272220	There's nothing you can do this time.

10282220	10292220	There's nothing you can do this time.
10293220	10306220	I'll take my meds in 30 minutes.
10306220	10311220	If I take it now, pull me to sleep.
10311220	10320220	I'm swimming.
10320220	10325220	Don't do this to me.
10325220	10329220	30 minutes, I promise.
10329220	10342220	Believe me.
10342220	10348220	I sleep like a pterodactyl.
10349220	10365220	I sleep like a pterodactyl.
10365220	10385220	I'll take my meds.
10385220	10394220	I'll take them.
10395220	10402220	I just ripped the scab off my hand.
10402220	10410220	The scab from the bike incident.
10410220	10422220	I was finally feeling.
10422220	10433220	Don't come, baby.
10433220	10441220	I make that noise when I fly to scare people sometimes.
10441220	10452220	Maybe fly around.
10452220	10456220	And also grow massive and still fly around.
10456220	10466220	Just a giant figure in the sky.
10471220	10487220	Just get really big.
10487220	10516220	Oh, no.
10517220	10537220	Oh, no.
10538220	10545220	It's just closed out.
10545220	10554220	Where did I stop reading?
10554220	10561220	This can create an artificial light energy stage with great luminosity.
10561220	10577220	The major caveat is that the phosphor is the super saturated solution will precipitate out rather quickly.
10577220	10588220	As soon as the phosphor recrystallizes, it loses its glow permanently.
10588220	10608220	If using super saturated red phosphor as a power source, make sure there are proper facilities or services that can replace it frequently.
10609220	10615220	I yield the author is so cool.
10615220	10622220	I already can travel over the world with a flying machine as I gather materials for his books.
10622220	10624220	Wow.
10624220	10629220	You know, I've tried looking for the flying machine with my binoculars for ages.
10629220	10635220	I was so such a thing, though.
10636220	10640220	What are you doing to that book?
10640220	10644220	Don't worry. These are my own books that I wrote.
10644220	10648220	I just pulled them off the shelves to modify them.
10648220	10651220	I have to cross out some sections.
10651220	10653220	Most sections.
10653220	10655220	I don't know how come.
10655220	10658220	Because otherwise they'll think I copied him.
10658220	10661220	Him the other.
10661220	10665220	Man, I really don't see the point of writing anything anymore.
10665220	10669220	The author is just gonna write about the same thing.
10669220	10671220	Then everyone will love it.
10671220	10675220	I know he's gonna remember the books that I came out before it is.
10675220	10677220	Oh, man.
10677220	10679220	I ain't hatin'.
10679220	10681220	I ain't hatin'.
10681220	10685220	I ain't hatin'.
10685220	10688220	I ain't hatin'.
10688220	10691220	I can see why people go nuts with this stuff.
10691220	10694220	That guy's got major talent.
10694220	10698220	This just hurts, you know?
10698220	10700220	I've had that before.
10700220	10704220	I used to draw stuff.
10704220	10710220	And I would draw like poses and stuff.
10710220	10713220	People would be like, you're just using that pose.
10713220	10715220	Someone else used that pose.
10715220	10718220	I'm just using this pose.
10718220	10721220	Oh.
10721220	10724220	Oh.
10724220	10733220	It's not a problem if people call you a copycat for something you wrote about first.
10733220	10735220	I can see that.
10735220	10740220	People call me a cat all the time.
10740220	10742220	Have me go.
10742220	10744220	Why is he so cute?
10744220	10746220	I don't know.
10746220	10750220	I don't want to be this cute.
10755220	10758220	It's a crime.
10758220	10764220	Even though I'm a person and cats are pets and mousebers.
10764220	10771220	I sure, I sure, I sure hope people don't think I eat mice.
10771220	10775220	I guess we're in the same boat, kiddo.
10775220	10779220	I think I changed at least half of books worth of content.
10779220	10782220	Even then, it's still too similar.
10782220	10784220	Looks like I'll just have to accept my fate.
10784220	10788220	But I guess being called a cat isn't all that bad.
10788220	10792220	As long as people don't assume you eat mice.
10794220	10796220	I'm done.
10796220	10799220	I'm done.
10799220	10801220	Excuse me.
10801220	10804220	Oh, you are the messiah.
10804220	10806220	Welcome.
10806220	10809220	I have to take this bracelet off the sternart.
10809220	10811220	Annoy me.
10811220	10813220	Get off me, get off me!
10813220	10816220	We're good.
10816220	10819220	We're fine.

10930520	10936520	She is here. She is in the archival room upstairs.
10936520	10944520	When she is concentrating on her work, she will ignore any and all phone call for several days.
10944520	10950520	Nice. Can you go get her in person then? Leaving this post is not in my programming.
10950520	10956520	And can I go myself? Of course. The archival room is accessible through the stairway behind me.
10957520	10958520	Gosh, I think.
10963520	10965520	Hello, very interesting archival room.
10968520	10971520	Coffee. Coffee is for grown-ups.
10972520	10974520	You know, Miko, you said you were a grown-up.
10975520	10979520	On authorised entry. Library card required for further access. Wait, what?
10980520	10982520	Library card required for further access.
10982520	10984520	No library card though. We're gonna get one.
10984520	10987520	This is a question for the headlamp.
10997520	10998520	Tell me to call her.
11009520	11011520	Are you heading to bed? Good night.
11012520	11013520	Have a good night.
11014520	11015520	Good night.
11020520	11023520	Thank you for stopping by the day's stream.
11034520	11035520	She is not picking up.
11036520	11037520	I figured.
11038520	11040520	Are you sure you can't just let me through?
11040520	11043520	Letting you through with that library card is against my programming.
11043520	11044520	What?
11045520	11048520	Even in an emergency, my program is not flexible.
11049520	11050520	I have not been tamed.
11058520	11059520	What if I just run?
11061520	11063520	What if I just run in with stopping me?
11064520	11066520	What's he gonna do, blow me up?
11067520	11071520	I thought the rules was not to hurt humans or any living creature.
11073520	11075520	I'm on my third cup of coffee.
11076520	11078520	I can't feel my limbs and stop drinking.
11079520	11082520	When I have to stay awake, I need to find out how this book ends.
11082520	11084520	You can read it the next day.
11085520	11087520	Wait, but the world is kind of ending.
11089520	11091520	Wanting to finish your book before it does.
11092520	11093520	Relatable.
11093520	11094520	Relatable?
11095520	11097520	Because the author and his beautiful clipping hurts.
11100520	11102520	I got a library card.
11108520	11110520	A library card.
11115520	11116520	He just played at me.
11117520	11118520	I don't think we should bother him.
11119520	11120520	What a jerk.
11121520	11123520	What a stinky poo poo head.
11124520	11125520	What a stinker.
11126520	11127520	Smells like kaka.
11132520	11133520	Street up.
11134520	11135520	Poopoo.
11136520	11137520	Love person.
11137520	11138520	Libraries up ahead, thanks.
11143520	11146520	Okay, that promises the least pain on your grave.
11146520	11147520	I do.
11150520	11151520	Um...
11164520	11166520	Oh, excuse me.
11168520	11171520	Wait, did I come from that way?
11181520	11184520	It's an elevator.
11186520	11188520	We have been here before.
11200520	11202520	Fish tank. It's a big fish tank.
11202520	11203520	Oh, hey there.
11204520	11205520	You have a lot of fish.
11205520	11207520	Yeah, I'm worried about them.
11207520	11208520	Huh?
11208520	11214520	Or something about how the square particle stuff just took out a major pipeline.
11214520	11218520	I guess I should take advantage of the running water while I still can.
11221520	11222520	The sink.
11224520	11225520	Big fish.
11225520	11226520	Nope.
11226520	11228520	Not looking for it's that water shortage.
11232520	11234520	Is there anything I can do in here?

11285520	11286520	What does that mean?
11286520	11287520	It means people who aren't kids.
11287520	11288520	Kids?
11288520	11290520	Or aren't you a kid?

12230800	12238800	It suddenly appeared. It was missing for like a whole two weeks. Now it's right in front of me.
12241800	12244800	I can't find it. I have it.
12247800	12249800	Oh shh.
12254800	12256800	I did not feel good.
12260800	12263800	Burned.
12291800	12293800	Alright.
12294800	12301800	All my vets have been taken. I even put my cream on. I did all of that.
12311800	12313800	And I'm gonna light this candle.
12321800	12323800	Can you help me?
12324800	12326800	Here you go.
12327800	12329800	Oh, that was hot.
12329800	12331800	I'm working here.
12357800	12359800	How about my schedule?
12377800	12380800	That was a thought that was in my head and I said it all out.
12381800	12388800	I wonder what the author would do in this situation.
12388800	12392800	I thought this little blank usually references his work.
12397800	12399800	There's work here.
12400800	12405800	The barrens in there just reported another sighting of the particles.
12405800	12411800	The particles are commonly not here unusual at this point.
12414800	12417800	Those squares particles just took it out.
12417800	12419800	I don't know about that one.
12420800	12423800	I might have to put on water and it was...
12423800	12425800	...adaptable.
12427800	12429800	Alright.
12435800	12439800	And we have some more disruptions.
12439800	12443800	And Sector 8 of the city.
12444800	12450800	This is consistent with our earlier findings. Not good at all.
12459800	12462800	I can barely keep my eyes open.
12462800	12464800	Help me too.
12464800	12470800	How does a doctor's silver blank get that all out energy?
12473800	12477800	These are of a thermal functioning at a frightening rate.
12477800	12484800	The school damage from square particle anomalies is almost impossible to reverse.
12484800	12488800	Not a living person can touch them unless they have a death wish.
12488800	12493800	But if we're lucky, sometimes the squares go away on their own.
12493800	12500800	But not before taking away one of the robot's arms or legs or head.
12501800	12503800	Okay.
12505800	12507800	I cannot stop spinning.
12508800	12510800	Robot.
12511800	12513800	You're waiting to be repaired.
12514800	12516800	You're waiting to be repaired.
12517800	12519800	This one is an active.
12520800	12523800	This is so tedious.
12523800	12530800	I miss the good old days before our robot repairing robots broke down.
12530800	12534800	All robots have to be assembled by actual people.
12534800	12537800	But aren't you a robot?
12537800	12539800	No?
12539800	12541800	Do I sound like a robot to you?
12541800	12542800	Or really?
12542800	12544800	Your head is a TV.
12544800	12547800	What does that have to do with anything?
12547800	12549800	Nevermind.
12550800	12552800	Robot.
12559800	12562800	A lot of us have been sleeping.
12562800	12567800	Sleeping very well in light of recent events.
12567800	12571800	And the square particle stuck out a few of my robots, I think.
12572800	12574800	She's still asleep.
12575800	12577800	She's still asleep.
12583800	12584800	That's me.
12584800	12588800	Ah, so I thought I'd sleep some time.
12589800	12591800	Hello?
12592800	12594800	Oh, shoot.
12594800	12596800	But I know you would be here so soon.
12596800	12599800	I would've turned off the darn wall.
12600800	12602800	Hello there.
12602800	12604800	What about the weird security measures?
12604800	12605800	Oh, yeah.
12605800	12607800	They're holding something.
12607800	12608800	I don't know.
12608800	12610800	Can I help you with anything?
12610800	12611800	Yeah.
12611800	12613800	Do you know how you get a library card?
12613800	12614800	A library card?
12614800	12617800	No, there's a library for that to try.
12617800	12620800	I need it to see the library.
12620800	12622800	But I can't get through the library card.
12622800	12625800	But at the same time, she's the one who gives out library cards.
12625800	12626800	Really.
12627800	12628800	Yeah.
12629800	12631800	I'm just going.
12632800	12634800	Please get some Eve for me.
12634800	12636800	Okay, I'm okay.
12640800	12642800	I'll go to sleep soon, alright?
12642800	12643800	I'm fine.
12644800	12647800	We're almost done with the game, I think, right?
12647800	12650800	How much longer do you think we have?
12651800	12654800	How much more do we have?
12655800	12657800	I want to keep going.
12657800	12659800	If we're so close, let's finish it.
12659800	12661800	We could finish it.
12663800	12665800	It will finish this.
12665800	12666800	I'm fine.
12668800	12670800	That sounds like JoJo already.
12670800	12673800	I'm sorry you can't hear all that fuzzy.
12674800	12675800	Wait, I don't know.
12675800	12677800	I need to see the library card.
12677800	12679800	It won't be hard for me to get on.
12679800	12680800	Okay.
12681800	12682800	There.
12682800	12684800	You're also, I think.
12684800	12685800	Wait.
12685800	12686800	Shoot.
12686800	12687800	I forgot.
12687800	12690800	If I'm just a library bot.
12690800	12692800	I have a face recognition function.
12692800	12693800	My photo.
12693800	12695800	The card won't match you.
12696800	12698800	How much do I have to have a photo?
12698800	12699800	Keep a photo.
12700800	12702800	My face to your face.
12702800	12704800	That was a joke.
12705800	12708800	No, no, maybe you'll get lucky enough about the video.
12709800	12711800	First comes first.
12711800	12714800	I always find stories in the photo.
12715800	12716800	What's this?
12716800	12718800	I'm always looking out for stuff.
12718800	12719800	The shit with glittering glue.
12719800	12721800	You know how that feels.
12721800	12723800	I don't know any glitter.
12723800	12724800	You sure?
12724800	12725800	Yeah.
12725800	12727800	How much on do those?
12727800	12729800	I'll throw us during your hair.
12729800	12731800	I know I do a little bit.
12735800	12738800	I've been walking all over the world.
12738800	12739800	Yeah.
12739800	12740800	Imagine.
12741800	12743800	Do you get really tired sometimes?
12743800	12744800	Yeah.
12744800	12745800	Yeah.
12746800	12747800	Yeah, kind of.
12747800	12748800	Yeah.
12749800	12750800	Yeah.
12751800	12752800	But I don't mind.
12752800	12754800	It's actually really pretty.
12754800	12756800	Yeah, this game is really great.
12758800	12760800	I'm glad that you think so.
12761800	12763800	Even when the sun's gone.
12763800	12765800	But it's still a beautiful place.
12766800	12769800	What does the world look like with the sun?
12769800	12770800	Oh.
12770800	12771800	Uh.
12771800	12772800	You know.
12772800	12774800	Some of the birds that I've met.
12774800	12776800	A little of us have actually seen it.
12776800	12777800	Oh.
12777800	12779800	Ironic, isn't it?
12779800	12782800	It was on the world's leading researcher.
12782800	12785800	While I just stay here and build robots.
12786800	12788800	They're the ones exploring the world.
12788800	12790800	I just write down the data.
12790800	12791800	Crunch numbers.
12791800	12792800	Generate graphs.
12792800	12793800	Right.
12794800	12796800	I've been seeing robots everywhere.
12796800	12800800	I thought it was because the world was too dangerous for most people to explore.
12800800	12803800	That's not far from the truth, actually.
12803800	12805800	But I know someone.
12805800	12807800	Still does this research for a second.
12807800	12808800	Oh.
12809800	12812800	Even after segments.
12812800	12815800	The land started collapsing and access.
12815800	12817800	But the more remote.
12818800	12819800	Uh.
12819800	12820800	There's a stretch.
12820800	12821800	You got it.
12821800	12822800	Here it is.
12822800	12824800	It became difficult.
12846800	12848800	We can finish an hour.
12848800	12849800	That's fine.
12849800	12851800	Let's finish this.
12852800	12854800	Because tomorrow we play stray.
12854800	12856800	And we get to be a cat.
12858800	12860800	Cat games.
12860800	12862800	The best kind of games.
12867800	12869800	Our game is calling you out.
12869800	12870800	It's true.
12870800	12871800	Drink water.
12871800	12873800	I've been drinking soda.
12873800	12875800	I haven't been drinking water.
12876800	12879800	I drunk all you an entire thing of orange juice today.
12882800	12883800	Oh.
12892800	12894800	Tomorrow's collab.
12894800	12895800	I forgot.

12898800	12899800	I forgot.
12899800	12901800	Tomorrow we have a group collab with the adults.
12903800	12905800	There are some of the adults girls.
12912800	12913800	Yeah.
12925800	12926800	I'll watch them.
12926800	12927800	I'm 40.
12927800	12929800	Turn it over with the voices.
12930800	12932800	You don't have all of our streams of them.

14432100	14434100	Wow
14451100	14458100	In my experience, the kind of knowledge is usually recorded in some cryptic book.
14458100	14464100	But I haven't read anything like that before. Sorry.
14464100	14470100	I have a cryptic book.
14470100	14476100	These books are full of cool speakers.
14476100	14482100	Those are my manuscripts that others sent me as a head librarian.
14482100	14488100	It's my job to help them with the publication process.
14488100	14494100	But it really hasn't been sending me anything.
14494100	14498100	This is an icon.
14498100	14504100	I guess it does give me some extra time to work through this backlog.
14504100	14508100	To be honest, I'm a little behind.
14508100	14512100	Here is another one.
14512100	14516100	This is an crossing book.
14516100	14522100	He stopped sending me many things with a pile of Korean semicircles the other day.

14758060	14761060	Very sketchy practice.
14765060	14767060	What the fuck happened?
14767060	14769060	Hey, I need this book.
14769060	14771060	It's actually a book lover.
14772060	14775060	Although this documentation
14775060	14778060	is primarily backed with black,
14778060	14781060	the leaves display incredible resistance
14781060	14784060	and exposes just in light.
14784060	14788060	These curious lands are more resilient, resilient,
14788060	14792060	and can even thrive in the metallic sand
14792060	14795060	and harsh climate of the land.
14796060	14798060	In the Glen,
14798060	14801060	you can also grow dark on top of the moss layer
14801060	14804060	without competing with the moss for resources.
14805060	14809060	Radiocarbon-dating fossils suggest
14809060	14811060	that these plants
14811060	14814060	would be the first lifeforms of the Glen Lake Outer World.
14816060	14818060	Cool.
14828060	14831060	A book is working out, isn't it?
14832060	14834060	Oh.
14836060	14839060	Thankfully, Dr. Silver points to you
14839060	14842060	with able to replicate our prototype.
14844060	14847060	On the right is an update sketch
14847060	14849060	of some modifications
14849060	14851060	of the external design.
14851060	14853060	More importantly,
14853060	14855060	we used a radical,
14855060	14860060	we used a radically different architecture
14860060	14862060	rather than micro-processors.
14862060	14865060	Due to the limited resources this time,
14865060	14869060	it still should be able to deliver
14869060	14873060	a label delivering the Lake Broadmasters' message.
14873060	14877060	The teams suggested that taming will last cause.
14891060	14894060	It's a bun.
14896060	14899060	It's a stack of paper.
14899060	14901060	My new script.
14902060	14904060	A full background.
14905060	14908060	But she did believe in the multiverse theory
14908060	14911060	regarding alternate verses.
14911060	14914060	She liked the probability
14914060	14916060	of the rolling of dice.
14917060	14919060	Searchingly,
14919060	14922060	I found that very easier and easier to believe,
14922060	14925060	but I could not describe it very well back then.
14925060	14927060	Nevertheless,
14927060	14930060	I still wrote it to the best of my abilities.
14930060	14933060	After all, it felt only right to honor
14933060	14935060	how hard this way.
14935060	14937060	There are six.
14937060	14940060	Which one did you encounter?
14940060	14942060	Four.
14942060	14944060	I've encountered four.
14947060	14950060	So that I won't sleep again.
14954060	14957060	The bridge is full of bottled water
14957060	14960060	and take-out boxes.
14961060	14963060	Work, work, work.
14963060	14965060	Work, work.
14965060	14967060	Click the scanner
14967060	14969060	and the printer.
14969060	14971060	I'm pretty sure you said something about
14971060	14974060	unupdated databases.
14974060	14976060	Unupdated databases.
14976060	14978060	Oh, man.
14978060	14980060	I see those here.
14989060	14991060	Work, work, work.
14991060	14993060	Work, work, work.
14993060	14995060	I keep a cover of everything that I published
14995060	14997060	for him in the archival room.
14997060	14999060	He didn't read some of it.
15000060	15002060	He didn't read some.
15002060	15004060	There are even illustrations.
15004060	15006060	Kids like pictures.
15006060	15008060	Right?
15012060	15014060	It's like a box back there.
15016060	15018060	And the painting is a box.
15032060	15034060	Hi, travel good night.
15034060	15036060	Thank you for stopping by today's stream.
15036060	15038060	I appreciate that.
15038060	15040060	Appreciate you.
15051060	15053060	Maybe...
15056060	15059060	Are you guys really trying to give me that?
15060060	15062060	To lengthen this?
15064060	15067060	I thought this game was going to be super short.
15067060	15069060	Like, not short.
15069060	15071060	I thought I could finish this game much faster.
15071060	15073060	But I get so distracted.
15073060	15077060	And then I don't even finish anything.
15080060	15082060	I'm ready yet.
15082060	15084060	Do you have any questions about books?
15084060	15086060	I can answer them.
15086060	15088060	I love books.
15090060	15092060	Haha.
15093060	15095060	It's about four to five hours to refresh it.
15095060	15097060	I thought I could.
15097060	15099060	I thought I could do that.
15099060	15101060	But I'm so slow.
15107060	15109060	I'm so slow.
15114060	15116060	Yeah.
15120060	15122060	Yes, I was only at the rest.
15125060	15128060	Can I share this strange journal?
15128060	15130060	Do you like this?
15130060	15132060	Oh, I did have this.
15132060	15134060	I think it's written in some kind of...
15134060	15136060	Swiss.
15136060	15138060	I moved my microphone something.
15140060	15142060	I'm leaning back.
15142060	15144060	Wrapped in a blanket right now.
15145060	15147060	Haha.
15147060	15150060	It was so cozy.
15150060	15152060	I was so cozy and comfy.
15153060	15155060	Haha.
15173060	15175060	I'm fine. I'm fine, thank you.
15178060	15180060	Damn mosquito.
15182060	15184060	I'm going to squish it when I get the chance.
15187060	15190060	He'll rule the day that he fucked with me.
15195060	15197060	I'll absolutely obliterate him.
15203060	15205060	I'll clap him with these shakes.
15205060	15207060	Haha.
15211060	15213060	Ow.
15215060	15217060	I think it's written in some sort of word.
15217060	15219060	I don't recognize it.
15219060	15221060	Oh my gosh.
15221060	15223060	It's a book.
15229060	15231060	It's not just any book.
15231060	15233060	Golly, which one is this?
15233060	15235060	Somewhere in the baron?
15235060	15237060	Oh.
15237060	15239060	We found it.
15239060	15241060	A safe.
15241060	15243060	Where is that?
15243060	15245060	To the cell?
15245060	15247060	In that case.
15247060	15249060	What do I have to do now?
15249060	15251060	And where is the journal?
15251060	15253060	Oh cool.
15253060	15255060	It might take a while though.
15255060	15257060	That's fine.
