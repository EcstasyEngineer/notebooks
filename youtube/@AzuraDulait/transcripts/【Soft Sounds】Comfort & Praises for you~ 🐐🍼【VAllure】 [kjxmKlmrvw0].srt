You

135
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You

136
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:30,000

You

142
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:46,000
What did I do to deserve a moment like you?

143
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Exist.

144
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
That's what you do.

145
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
That's what all of you did.

146
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You exist.

147
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And I'm so happy to have all of you here.

148
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Thank you.

149
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Thank you for being here.

157
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yes, baby.

158
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It's okay to fall asleep.

159
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
If you're sleepy, I want to sleep.

160
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Give in.

161
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Give in while asleep.

162
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Mommy would love to.

163
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I would love to do bedtime stories.

164
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
We will save death.

165
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
For another time.

166
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Right now, it's relaxation time.

167
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Relax.

168
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But I see some of you are thirsty.

169
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Do you want me to pour you a cup of milk?

170
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Here, may pour you some milk.

171
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:22,000

Let me know.

182
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's in your sleeping cup.

183
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:24,000
The cup is for the big boys and the big girls.

184
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That's right.

185
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I want more milk.

186
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I will pour you another cup of milk.

187
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:54,000

Here.

197
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Mommy can be so clumsy sometimes.

198
00:41:40,000 --> 00:42:08,000
There seems to be a milk everywhere.

199
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Mommy does have a towel while I clean it up.

200
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Right now.

201
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:38,000

01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
It's okay.

422
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
It's okay.

423
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
It's okay.

424
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
It's okay.

425
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
It's okay.

426
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
It's okay.

427
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
It's okay.

428
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,000
It's okay.

429
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
It's okay.

430
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Don't worry.

431
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Mommy is here.

432
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Mommy is here.

433
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Mommy is here.

434
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Mommy is here.

435
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Mommy is here.

436
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Mommy is here.

437
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,000
It's a bad time.

438
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
We have to wash you up.

439
01:21:38,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Mommy is here.

440
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Mommy is here.

441
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Mommy is here.

442
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Look at all the bubbles.

443
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Mommy is here.

444
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Mommy is here.

445
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Mommy is here.

446
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Mommy is here.

447
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Mommy is here.

448
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Mommy is here.

449
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Mommy is here.

450
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Mommy is here.

451
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Mommy is here.

452
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Mommy is here.

453
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Mommy is here.

454
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Mommy is here.

455
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Mommy is here.

456
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Mommy is here.

457
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Mommy is here.

458
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Mommy is here.

459
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Mommy is here.

460
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Mommy is here.

461
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Mommy is here.

462
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Mommy is here.

463
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Mommy is here.

464
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Mommy is here.

465
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Mommy is here.

466
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Mommy is here.

467
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Mommy is here.

468
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Mommy is here.

469
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Mommy is here.

470
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Mommy is here.

471
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Mommy is here.

472
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Mommy is here.

473
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Mommy is here.

474
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Mommy is here.

475
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Mommy is here.

476
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Dry you.

477
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Look at you all nice and dry.

478
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Let's brush that hair.

479
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Let's brush that hair.

480
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Make up.

481
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Don't you look pretty.

482
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Make up.

483
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Make up.

484
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Don't you look pretty for mommy.

485
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
All dry.

486
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I'm looking all my sink clean.

487
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:07,000
You smell very good.

488
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,000
So good.

489
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
That's a good boy.

490
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:27,000
That's a very good girl.

491
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:34,000
It's time for bed.

492
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Are you ready for bed?

493
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:44,000
It's time to get some sleep.

494
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:49,000
So let's get ready to get some sleep.

495
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Okay?

496
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Mmm.

497
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Mmm.

498
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:13,000
He's dry.

499
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Mmm.

500
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Get into bed.

501
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I'll talk you out.

502
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:41,000
You're so good for me.

503
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I'm so very good.

504
01:27:52,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Mmm.

505
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:14,000
That's right.

506
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Here.

507
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Good.

508
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Are you nice and comfy?

509
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
With your favorite blanket?

510
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Mmm.

511
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Mmm.

512
01:28:49,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Mmm.

513
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,000
That's good.

514
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Easy.

515
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
All right.

516
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:30,000
It's time to sleep.

517
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:44,000
So let me.

518
01:29:44,000 --> 01:30:00,000
You want to.

519
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Make your story.

520
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Okay?

521
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I want to hear a story.

522
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Okay?

523
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Okay?

524
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Okay?

525
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Okay?

526
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Okay?

527
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Okay?

528
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Okay?

529
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Okay?

530
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Okay?

531
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I can tell you a little story about the past.

532
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Now the earth came to me.

533
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:48,000
And do you want to hear that story?

534
01:31:48,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Mmm.

535
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
That's good.

536
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Stay nice and comfy and listen closely.

537
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Once upon a time, when the earth first came to be,

538
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:40,000
it was empty and flat,

539
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:47,000
no trees, no mountains,

540
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,000
no light inside.

541
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:58,000
There was nothing.

542
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:07,000
And then the silence was broken.

543
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
From the earth's cross,

544
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:15,000
pros, me,

545
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
and my family,

546
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:27,000
my first family.

547
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:39,000
We had a measurable power within ourselves

548
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:48,000
and formed beauty and everything on this earth.

549
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,000
And the mountains,

550
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
the ground,

551
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
the trees,

552
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,000
and the grass.

553
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,000
But I felt

554
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:14,000
that there was something missing.

555
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Something needed to be there to enjoy the scenery,

556
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:27,000
the beautiful mountains,

557
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:33,000
rivers and such.

558
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:39,000
So I added the fish or the waters.

559
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
The shapes.

560
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
The cows.

561
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
The owls.

562
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
And the cats.

563
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:54,000
So many animals.

564
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:00,000
And with that,

565
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I created a circle of life.

566
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,000
From there,

567
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,000
seemed something more

568
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:31,000
than what was missing.

569
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Something there.

570
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Something I already hold so close to being already.

571
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Animals are easy to understand,

572
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,000
but what if there was a being

573
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
that more clear control

574
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
on their own decisions

575
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
and might control

576
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:06,000
and could continue to grow?

577
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,000
I added you,

578
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,000
my little layman,

579
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:20,000
precious babies.

580
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Oh, how I cared for you,

581
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
the care of you,

582
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
thought of you,

583
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
clothed you.

584
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I taught you the ways of living.

585
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
And from there,

586
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
you worshipped me.

587
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,000
You worshipped me, the family.

588
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,000
And all time came

589
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,000
and passed.

590
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
My family wanted to

591
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,000
create life themselves.

592
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
So they left.

593
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:14,000
But I just couldn't leave you all behind.

594
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:20,000
I cared for you all very dearly.

595
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,000
So I left some of my powers

596
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:29,000
at my divinity with my family.

597
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
And I decided to stay

598
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:37,000
and live amongst you.

599
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:45,000
And join you.

600
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I loved and still do.

601
01:37:49,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Care for you.

602
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I wanted to spend time with you

603
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
and still help you

604
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
with everything,

605
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
full.

606
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Unfortunately,

607
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
time waits for no one.

608
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:29,000
And with the power of the gods gone,

609
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:34,000
rose the desire

610
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,000
for power amongst the humans.

611
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,000
And they fought.

612
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
They fought.

613
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
And fought.

614
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:55,000
So many precious lives are lost.

615
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,000
None of us.

616
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:05,000
This is fine.

617
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,000
As time continued to go on,

618
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I felt rather lonely, forgotten.

619
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:27,000
But I felt this burning desire

620
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
and this need

621
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:36,000
to create a family of my own.

622
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,000
So,

623
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,000
and now I'm here

624
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:49,000
to gain your heart,

625
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:54,000
to create a family

626
01:39:54,000 --> 01:40:15,000
of love and care for you.

627
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
And I thank you,

628
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
all of you,

629
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:28,000
for being here with me.

630
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,000
It has been a bumpy road,

631
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:37,000
a long bumpy road.

632
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
And I appreciate

633
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
every last one of you,

634
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:48,000
my precious babies.

635
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Thank you, little bleeding hearts.

636
01:40:51,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Thank you.

637
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Love will never stop loving you.

638
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Thank you.

639
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Yes, that means you too.

640
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Thus, in most of the time,

641
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:43,000
let me must take the leave

642
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:48,000
and you continue to rest.

643
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:53,000
You can either keep your eyes closed

644
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,000
and stay asleep

645
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:02,000
or open them.

646
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Hanging out with me

647
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,000
as we began

648
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
to prepare ourselves

649
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:15,000
for the days to come.

650
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:20,000
As time will continue to roll

651
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
and I will be with you

652
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:29,000
there at all.

653
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Every second, every minute,

654
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:47,000
every hour.

655
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:54,000
You sweet babies.

656
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Yes.

657
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I promise

658
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I'll always be close by

659
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,000
in your heart,

660
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
in your prayers

661
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,000
because I am your goddess.

662
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Rock and do away.

663
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:46,000
You must write.

664
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Help.

665
01:43:48,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I was prepared.

666
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:25,000
This is me.

667
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Write.

668
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Do you want me

669
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,000
to just end?

670
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:58,000
I'm afraid to read someone

671
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:08,000
because what if it wigs everyone?

672
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:13,000
I should hurry.

673
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Read Shibu.

674
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Shibu is still online

675
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,000
doing an overcock

676
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:36,000
a collab

677
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:47,000
with Norikon Taichung.

678
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Do you want to hug? Show.

679
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:12,000
There you go.

680
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:18,000
One blind kiss.

681
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,000
You're being so good.

682
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Well deserved.

683
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Hi. It's time for bed.

684
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
If you guys can,

685
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I would rather do it like this.

686
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:14,000
We don't disturb the others.

687
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I'm going to post the link instead.

688
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Okay.

689
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
If you guys haven't already done so,

690
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:57,000
please like and subscribe

691
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:09,000
and leave a comment in the comment section.

692
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
And say,

693
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
here's your question today.

694
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Did you enjoy the ASMR today?

695
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:29,000
And if so, what was your favorite part?

696
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Good night, my sweet ones.

697
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,000
And thank you so much, the Terminator

698
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,000
or the $5 tippy.

699
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Thank you.

700
01:48:50,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I'll wear it.

701
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Once I post the link,

702
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
everyone go in.

703
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Click the link

704
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,000
and dance to a raid on official raid

705
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:33,000
as to not wake the sleepers.

706
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Also please remember,

707
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
also follow me on Twitter, please.

708
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Follow me on Twitter for silly posts

709
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:48,000
and buy my merch in the description below,

710
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,000
along with the Patreon

711
01:49:52,000 --> 01:50:02,000
or more exclusive ASMRs and audios.

712
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Thank you so much all for the $5 tippy.

713
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Never take care of us today, mama.

714
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,000
You're very welcome.

715
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Good night, my babies.

716
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Have a sweet, sweet dream.

717
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
And dream of me

718
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
cuddling you,

719
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
holding you tight.

720
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Mommy loves you.

721
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Don't forget.

722
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Good night.

723
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Bye-bye.

724
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I'll see you tomorrow.

725
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Bye-bye.

726
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Bye-bye.
