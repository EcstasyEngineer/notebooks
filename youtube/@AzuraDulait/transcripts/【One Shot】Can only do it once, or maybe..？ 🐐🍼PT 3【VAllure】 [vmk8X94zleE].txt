ʀk ʀ�कᦀ ʀ� mondo ʏ detailed how
mine decided to make toast yeah i think i was sleeping when this happened i don't remember where i was
i just know i was in my room i was in my room i was in my room having a good time doing whatever
i was doing aki but then all of a sudden i smelled something it smelled
it smelled like fire fire where's that smoke
what's that what what i gotta go check it out
so i get up and i open my door and then a huge cloud of gray smoke fills my room
the entire ceiling is covered in smoke
the entire ceiling is covered in smoke and i had to bend down and walk all the way to the kitchen
to see what the heck happened
i go into the the the kitchen and there my sibling is coming out of their room at the same time
and we we both walk in there together and i'm like what the heck's going on why is there smoke
what's going on and they were like i was making toast
we're like toast that's the toaster and then we go in there and then there's more smoke
spewing out of the toaster spewing out of the toaster
so for like a couple of years before this incident our toaster was actually broken
it was broken for like a couple of years every time you push the toaster down every now and then
the button doesn't come back up so the toaster would stay on even if the timer was over
it didn't pop pop pop back up so
it was like rule of thumb not to leave the toaster when when you make toast but
i think in between the time it was broken and the incident it was working for a little bit
so my sibling left the toaster alone with the toast and forgot about it
so yeah um when uh when we got to the toaster
we got to the toaster um my sibling popped the toaster out
popped the toast out and it was black like charred like it looked like charcoal
it looked like burning charcoal the center was a little like little grayish but it was
like it looked like magma in the center like in the very very center it looked like
it was like bubbling and popping in the center of the of the toast of the now charcoal bread
it was it was it was like bubbling and popping my my my sibling took it out with a like
they tried to use their like hand and it was too hot so they used an oven mat
and they pulled it out with the oven mat and then the oven mat caught fire yeah
so
and we haven't had a toaster since
no toaster
okay
let me add a toaster oven i'm not really sure what happened to that one
it just disappeared i went in there one day to make me a toaster and it was gone
so we don't own a toaster or a toaster oven but someone got us a toaster on throw now
so yay we'll we'll have a toaster i'll have a toaster again i can make toast normally
yay
make sure no fires occur i'll just i'll just keep the toaster in my room
i don't want my sibling to come asking to make toast
i think the reason why the old toaster broke was because people forced it to pop you know how you
push the pop button up and it will pop um not a lot of toasters are designed to do that
so i think
i think uh i think they broke it by doing that so i'm afraid of of leaving the new one in there
and them doing that again
so they um and broke it perfect the toaster i have molts and hot toast yeah it's not the first time
it's not the first time we had a fire though yeah we had a fire a couple of times
um in this house in this house
i'll show you guys if i want to hear about that
yeah a couple of times yeah
here you go my lips are a little dry
oh yeah put this on my lips yeah we had a few fires
so
some of them were accidental
there's no way to sound on my internet
it keeps going on and off it's gone again
it's back again
but it's not my internet internet what the heck
this is not my actual internet i'm watching it
what's going on what's going on what is happening
my my connection to my actual internet is fine it's the connection to
this here that's not okay what's going on with this what is that what is it breaking
what do you guys hear last for me i was talking about a fire
this is a toaster a good idea it'll be fine i'm sure it'll be fine
um
but yeah a few of the uh incidents were accidents and maybe one of them was like a
uh an accident
mm-hmm
completely freak accident yeah
so make sure you stay safe with the fires don't play with fire and and um

ethnic
ethnic city

the people whom I was raised around
yes
my accent is adopted from
various other ethnicities, cultures
and nationalities
yes

no one that's underneath it all
my original accent is actually southern
yeah
am I from there?
no
my family is though
but they moved
and my family has
the accent
it kind of goes down a few generations before it disappears
and it's kind of going with me
so because
my family have all of them have
a southern accent
I have adopted that as well
wow

probably probably i know it used to happen a lot when i would play uh when i'm play league
or any competitive games and happen a lot
in florida is kiland pa i like kiland pa but not
not a lot though kiland pa is very good though i love it
mustard barbecue sauce i'm not a fan of mustard but i do like barbecue sauce it is very good
now yihao and we all said
sounds like a wild west cowboy do i
do i declare why
i got a plan arthur why why
um lemon cake is my go to i like lemon cake
the more you guys say all these southern lines make me read all these southern lines
it's going to bother it's going to stick we can't have that right i worked hard to get rid of it
i worked hard you will not get rid of my efforts all right i worked hard
i worked very hard
hard
cream pies are your favorite yeah cream pies i like a good cream pie
coconut cream pie
it's pretty good
i like sweet tea i like sweet tea very sweet
um my family members like their sweet tea very better for some reason though
i have a sweet tooth so very extreme sweet tooth
such a cute accent it's not what do you mean it sucks i hate it it's dumb
i used to get made fun of for it it's a dumb accent it's dumb i hate it
it's dumb
now all y'all darn well i work tell you
why why why
no that's not southern
i can't do a british accent i've tried
i can't do a british or all the accent i can't it's impossible
it sounds so natural for you
bitter sweet tea but doesn't that defeat the purpose of it being sweet tea
that's what i said that's what i said i think that too

I can't see her.
Yes.
She made me pancakes.
What?
I think it was my birthday.
Because people always get their favorite food on their birthdays.
I remember my birthdays, they sucked really badly.
I get a little emotional when it comes to birthdays.
My birthday was always forgotten.
My birthday was forgotten for 3-4 years straight in a row.
A whole lot of it.
Do you have a birthday?
I do.
It's August 21st.
August 24th.
Oh, accidentally.
Where's that?
Yes, I do.
Oh, then what's your favorite food?
Is it pancakes?
Wait, do you like pancakes?
I do.
Yes, me too.
On my last birthday, I ate two of them.
So many.
I was so full I didn't eat anything else that day.
But you're telling her, be careful.
It's so much, you're telling her.
We won't regret it.
I hope you won't.
Thank you.
Thank you everyone.
You have it on your calendar.
Yay.
Yeah, no birthday for 3 years.
Yes, it's my day of creation.
My mama makes the best packets.
And some of the neighbors make really good noodles.
My mom made the best oatmeal.
It was mostly my grandma's oatmeal.
She made it with absolute love.
I don't know how she did it.
We don't know what her secret ingredient was and we'll never know.
All we can do is experiment and see if we can get it to taste the same.
There's just no way we can ever get it to taste the same.
So my mom's oatmeal came in second.
It was close, very close enough to it.
It was my favorite food that she would make.
Oh, one of our neighbors makes a lot of bread.
Bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread.
Do you have any neighbors?
Yeah, they're kind of them.
They're great.
I like my neighbors so much.
Good neighbors.
Well, one of them is actually a really, really good neighbor.
She's a sweetheart.
A really, really old lady.
Really, really old lady.
Sweetheart.
Yes.
Oh, do they share their food with you?
She used to, not anymore.
Now she comes over and asks if we have sugar to lend or a roll of toilet paper.
I guess I'll say no.
It's been years since then, since we last shared.
We're the ones that share food with her now.
Whenever we have big events and stuff, we'll make a supper plate for her and give it to her.
Such as I know her, yes.
Since it's an occasional thing and she doesn't share food with us.
We share food with her.
Yeah, they say no.
They say no.
It's not very nice of them.
It's true.
Our neighbors and my mama take turns making food at the whole village each day.
That's sweet.
Aw.
I still tell a little white lie.
Nah.
I tell the truth.
I'm really actually really bad at telling lies.
It's not my forte.
But I do like trolling.
It's my favorite thing to do.
I'm not really good at lying, but I do like trolling.
Everyone also takes turns doing chores and watching the little kids.
It sounds like a very nice village.
I don't need to be watched anymore though.
I'm old enough to help out.
Yeah, you are. You're a big boy now.
Big boy Nico.
You're a big boy.
You are so cute.
I miss everyone.
Aw.
I've been gone for a while now, haven't I?
I wonder if they're worried about me.
Speaking of helping out, I should probably go now.
Right.
Do I have to take a nap?
How do you run again?
Yeah.
Alright.
So where I left off, I was trying to figure out how do you...
Oh yeah, I need scissors.
Where get scissors?
Wait, this is a bakery, right?
This is like a cafe.
I need scissors to, I think, cut the tape.
But where the heck do you get scissors from?
Okay.
Probably I'm missing something.
Oh.
Does this person do anything?
Like, do I, like, give her something?
No, I think I already tried that.
I'm not very good at lying.
Then you're probably going to answer the personality quiz and mystery dungeon, honestly.
Most likely.
Okay.
Where the heck do you get scissors from?
Wait a minute.
I think I saw an extra room. Was it an extra room?
Is this the library?
Yeah, that one was this room, I know.
I saw a hallway or something.
This.
Oh!
A room I haven't been in!
Scissors.
The pair of scissors on the ground.
A pile of hair.
I don't think anyone's using this anymore.
The sink.
Soap dispenser.
I found scissors.
Hm, hahaha.

How are we gonna connect it to the elevator?
So, let's find out.
Okay, let's save this one there.
What if we just fold the magnet under this edge?
And it's holding together just barely.
How does this go on now?
And what's the tape for?
Save this one there.
Oh, of course.
I had to tape it together or it might fall apart.
Yeah?
I'm thinking, sir.
I'm smart!
You know that?
I'm so smart.
Look at me.
I'm so smart.
Yeah, so now we can go to the surface.
Oh!
Reactivating elevator services.
Please input security code to continue.
What?
What's never happened before?
The squares?
Huh?
You saw them, right?
They were on the door and...
Oh, no.
The scores have happened all the time.
I meant the whole security code thing.
But then again, the elevator hasn't been as broken before.
Hmm.
I guess we should go look for a code, is there a?
Yeah, let's go look for a code.
I broke it.
Security code to continue.
Oh.
Access denied.
Can I help with anything?
Anyhow.
Things are unproductive for so long.
It's really...
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I'm going to head out for the five dollar tip.
Thank you, thank you.
What?
Yeah, they're super jealous.
They want a piece of this bread and they can't have it.
Sorry.
It's really getting to me.
I think it's Zora and I got an handle.
What do you think, Zora?
It's on the standard.
It's on these random codes.
Maybe you could just try out some numbers until you get it?
Alright, I suppose that's better than doing nothing.
Let's see.
Yep, gonna be here for a while.
You aren't seriously doing this, are you?
Which way was it to that door?
Oh, it's upright.
I think I have to get it from up here.
Wait, should I go check on plant?
Plant lady?
Is plant lady okay?
I have access...
I have the code from last time, I think, do I?
Do I?
I do! You're right!
I do, I do, I do.
Is she okay?
Alright, she's okay.
Yeah, the film, the film!
The film!
It was 6304.
6304.
I'm gonna move myself out of the way a little more.
No?
Yeah.
Can't find him.
Hang on one moment.
Hit.
Hit.
Oh my goodness.
6304.
What?
Yeah.
What?
It works!
I don't know what you did, but it actually works.
Good job, Kat.
You're a genius, you know that?
And I hope for Missouri, too.
I think, I think...
Oh, right.
The whole Messiah business.
Anyway, ready to go?
Bye bye.
Wait.
Doesn't he do one last thing here?
Don't be afraid to ask if you're hungry.
I don't get a pancake or a Nikko.
I thought I got a pancake for a Nikko.
I think I hear my door.
Hang on, I hear my door.
Give me one second.
Give me one second, give me one second.
Hang on, I hear my door.
Give me one second.
Give me one second, give me one second.
No, that wasn't my door.
That was just someone else out there.
I got tricked.
I was tricked.
I was tricked.
I was tricked.
I was tricked.
I was tricked.
I was tricked.
I was tricked.
I was tricked.
Oh, hey. Welcome back.
That shirt took you a while, huh?
Oh shoot, you've been waiting this whole time.
I wasn't gone that long!
And holding the door open.
Well, I don't want to be rude.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that, god!
I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that, god!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Oh no!
I wasn't gone that long.
I just walked away for a tiny bit.

maybe we can chat to pass the time then.
You heard me?

most of the city's stuff. Oh, we used to have a small army of delivery robots doing that, but
lately a bunch of them have been breaking down. So until they fix them, I'll just have more work on
my plate, and it's left into long. When will the robots get fixed? I have no idea. It's all up to the
scientists over at the labs, but they seem really concerned about something else lately. Oh,
never a good sign when even the smart folks are worried. All right, Zora, should I ask about the city?
The city is very big. It's smaller than it looks. Dang, this whole conversation while we're going
to the floor. We must be really high up. I knew you here. Welcome in. Nice to see you,
but I'm very sure I've seen you before.
I love to be trapped in an elevator with a Zora with you. I might ravish you.
Good evening, Muldor. Good evening.
Getting pretty crowded too. First there was the refugees from the barrens, and now more
women folks are moving into. Oh, it's a safer here, you know? I mean, it's not a haven by any means.
That square stuff that we just saw, we have more of that here than anywhere else apparently,
I noticed. We're lucky it only seems to affect the city's infrastructures. The land mass
itself is still holding up, which is good since there isn't much solid land here in the first place.
All right, how's Zora? Should I ask about the library? Can you tell me about the library?
I'm supposed to go there. Oh yeah, that's one of my main delivery spots.
Those reading lights are pretty high maintenance.
Well, I just feel out of place surrounded by smart people. Well, here's just pretty smart
yourself, so you'll fit in line, you and Zora. I'm dumb. I don't know what he's talking about.
I mean, no, I'm smart. I am so smart. I am intelligent. I am the brightest person ever.
I am intelligent.
Anyway, it was a nice meeting you.
Right, see you around. Good, good around now.
I guess we should hurry too. Zora, people are counting on us. Yeah, let's go find that library.
Amos the robot. Beep boop. Beep boop.
Suspicious person.
Suspicious person, sigh. You all right? Uh, what was I at? Perhaps this is a sigh.
Tell me, do you think you could fix the world with the sun? Honestly, I don't know.
I've been getting mixed messages. I know. But what do you think? I think.
I think I should listen to Zora. After all, Zora helped me get this far.
That'll take your faith or an answer then. What do you mean by that? It means what
you think it means.
Strage man. Strage man.
Strage man.
It's fine. It's fine. I'm really scared.
Oh, the business gave me so bad a heart. It hurt me so bad. It gave me, oh my god.
I was so unprepared for that. My chest hurt for a second. It hurt for a split second.
I'm fine.
Zora, did you see what happened? Yeah, my vision went blank for a second.
And then I saw something, like a really short dream. I don't know what that was about.
Strage man. Strage man.
What's up here?
Another alleyway?
Why should I check out over here first?
It's a faded flyer. It's a faded flyer.
I'm curious and marking on the ball. Looks like a round.
He-ee.
What's down here?
This is strangely warm in this room.
Oh, a cat. Are you lost? Me? Do you wish to join us?
I want to be with the cats. I want this. It's not fair. I want this. This I want. I want.
I want this. I want this.
Join your cats? Yes. But I'm not a cat. I don't walk on far likes like they do.
You have cat eyes? My eyes are normal, people eyes. Well, I'm normal back home.
You're how to shoot like a cat. But I'm just a person. You're still welcome here.
I protect lost people as well. Thanks. No, not lost though. You got a sword to guide me. I see.
Why must our cat map? The cats are cute.
Oh, please. Do not approach.
Oh.
Oh, not going in there. Not yet.
What's up here? Oh, not going in there. What's up here?
What's this? The bag has some big plastic disc here. Looks like they're supposed to go in something.
Wait, is there are really going to take these with us? They look so heavy. All right.
They're actually pretty light. It's a big book. The title says understanding robots.
An empty glass jar with water handle. A bed. The blanket has quite a few patches.
I don't know if I can see. There's some broken glass in there. Big coffee cups.
A lantern plant. Hang on. I need to
put cream on my wrist. My wrist is starting to
hurt.
Goodbye never a second.
Oh.
Oh, no.

Just now
I got a rather calm heart, right?
Come for now
But my issue with my heart rate is that it goes
It becomes too slow
So the numbers are dipping
Don't be concerned
It's fine
I might feel a little faint
But I just need to relax
That's all
Not the only thing you'll probably notice
Is it dipping
If it goes any higher
It's probably because I took my medication
My medication sometimes makes my heart rate go a little high
Yeah, the heart rate monitor takes time to go up
It doesn't go up right away
So when I got scared it
It definitely went up to like 70-something
But it takes time to read the heart
Promise you'll be okay
I'm fine, I'll be okay
They don't taste too bad though
Do you want one?
It's okay, thank you
Hey, hey
Ready for me to blow your mind?
Yeah, okay, so
I've invented a machine, a medicine
To prepare everyone for the upcoming water shortage
All you gotta do is dissolve one of these pills in water
Then you drink the water
Then you never need to drink water again
What?
It also makes plants grow faster
How does it work?
Here, why don't you take a free sample?
Oh, thanks
Don't thank me, go spread the word

The library is up ahead.
When the world ends, would it be better if it was gone and an instant are slowly fading away?
An instant.
If I were to witness the world perishing, I would rather it be spontaneous.
Boom!
It's fast.
Boom!
It's fun.
I feel a thing.
Boom!
To be honest, I'd rather the former.
Anything over here?
But in all honesty, I don't want it to end.
Or do I?
No, I don't want it to end.
I don't want it to end.
Oh, we're in the library.
It's a little bridge bridge.
It's a box by the box.
Some sort of something.
I have a person with white hair.
I like your hair.
What?
Well, I didn't say anything.
Stop staring at me, then.
I was looking at your book.
Yes, you're in the library.
There's books in the library.
Go bug the chatty one upstairs.
Others books covered a wide range of topics.
It seems there are no subjects.
It is not right.
Right about.
Quite the renaissance, man.
What do you think?
I hate this brace.
It makes my wrist so itchy.
I guess so.
But he's been focusing on documenting the world.
As a boy.
Oh?
Is it a city that's the last...

Some of these books
may be the only thing
we have to remember

But our goddess wouldn't let that happen.
The world ending?
I'll do my best,
but I could barely
I could
I could barely stop a war.
I like lost a lot of my
my powers.
I'm not as strong as I used to be.
I'm not as strong as I used to be.
Sorry, I barely could stop a war.
I don't think I could stop the world from ending.

I prefer instant death.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Beis-ti-on?
Ah.
Oh, hello. Do you need directions?
Let's see. This area here
is mostly historical accounts.
The reference section
is downstairs.
I'm not sure where the children's section is.
It's okay.
I'm not really looking for books.
I'm looking to look for
the author then.
Oh, that's good.
I mean
that means you won't be disappointed
when volunteering here
for months and I've never seen him.
I haven't once.
It works together with the head librarian
on publishing.
So you'd think he would at least
show up once in a while.
But
he doesn't?
He seems kind of
kind of
reclusive.
Which is weird
for a guy who supposedly
travels for it.
Maybe it's just around people.
Let me by.
Let me in.
Computer, it's currently all.
Let's over here.
Robot.
Oh, person.
Hi.
Reselving in progress.
Please watch out
for potential
following books.
I will.
Still scared of ladders.
Oh.
You know what I forgot to do today?
Before stream.
It was something I forgot to do today.
I forgot.
I completely forgot.
I forgot to say on twitter
that I was live.
Oops.
I react.
Butter late than ever.
Yeah, let's do that right now.
We'll be live for a little while.
It's almost hibernation time.
One day I'm going to sleep
for like 13 hours.
So.
Ready for it.
Oh.
Ow.
I hit my head.
I feel like.
My horn is hit.
Hit the microphone.
I was just trying to stretch.
I just wanted to stretch.
Okie är.
Ah.
I like you guys.
You guys are great.
Um...
I'll be straight on!
Hey ...
Did you see the weight of your laterals?

Maybe he can stop time?
No such mechanism exists in this world.
Is that actually possible in your home dimension?
No. I just saw it in a movie once.
About superheroes and stuff.
You're going through these pages pretty fast.
Actually, it's mostly pictures.
Oh? Yeah. Oh, that doesn't only write books.
It also illustrates them.
Sometimes he makes books of only pictures.

Common firefly.
Nocturnal beetle with a vibrant glow,
sometimes captured and messed and put in jars
to be used as living lamps by the Glen's residents.
This has inspired the now common practice

Book reading is smart.
Using that voice really kind of...
It's because I can't take breaths in between,
like proper breaths.
And my lungs aren't so great.
So when I read in that voice,
it's hard to take a breath.
The author's latest books are really something, yeah?
Oh, that librarian just released a bunch last week.
Oh, they're big.

As a general rule, if a phosphorous loses its glow entirely, it cannot be re-lit unless exposed to the sun.
If the phosphor is merely dim, it may be possible to boost it through exposure through another phosphor of higher energy.
But even so, the boosted phosphor will never return to its original brightness.
Chapter 5. A survey of phosphors found in the natural world.
Chapter 6. Blue Phosphor Location
Blue Phosphor is of moderate levels of energy. It can exist in both organic and mineral forms.
A mineral form is most commonly found in the metallic sound of the parents.
The organic form is most commonly found in phosphor strength and in secretions.
Although the light emission of blue phosphor is powerful, it has what I would describe as self-conserving properties.
That is to say, the glow may not be constant. Most forms of blue phosphor will stop glowing if left undisturbed for long periods of time.
If using blue phosphor to perform machines, a motor should be set at a baseline level of activity to ensure constant agitation of the phosphor. Alternatively, live phosphors from can be used.
Chapter 7. Green Phosphor Location
Green Phosphor is one of the highest energy. It is almost the rarest of the common phosphor as it can only be found in organic form.
The known sources include the sap of phosphor trees, fireflies, and various mosses.
Although this phosphor is present in a... uh oh, what word is that? Apoquitas grounds covering moss in the glen. It is only a minute or months and almost impossible to concentrate.
Green Phosphor is ideal or industrial use, however, due to its relative scarcity and past over-arvesting.
And there is currently no reliable source. Thankfully, at least locals of the glen still have enough to get by.
Ubiquitas.
Ubiquitas?
What a strange word. Ubiquitas.
English is silly. And there it is.
I'm a little bit eeby. I think you guys already noticed. I'm a little bit eeby.

I just ripped the scab off my hand.
The scab from the bike incident.
I was finally feeling.
Don't come, baby.
I make that noise when I fly to scare people sometimes.
Maybe fly around.
And also grow massive and still fly around.
Just a giant figure in the sky.
Just get really big.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
It's just closed out.
Where did I stop reading?
This can create an artificial light energy stage with great luminosity.
The major caveat is that the phosphor is the super saturated solution will precipitate out rather quickly.
As soon as the phosphor recrystallizes, it loses its glow permanently.
If using super saturated red phosphor as a power source, make sure there are proper facilities or services that can replace it frequently.
I yield the author is so cool.
I already can travel over the world with a flying machine as I gather materials for his books.
Wow.
You know, I've tried looking for the flying machine with my binoculars for ages.
I was so such a thing, though.
What are you doing to that book?
Don't worry. These are my own books that I wrote.
I just pulled them off the shelves to modify them.
I have to cross out some sections.
Most sections.
I don't know how come.
Because otherwise they'll think I copied him.
Him the other.
Man, I really don't see the point of writing anything anymore.
The author is just gonna write about the same thing.
Then everyone will love it.
I know he's gonna remember the books that I came out before it is.
Oh, man.
I ain't hatin'.
I ain't hatin'.
I ain't hatin'.
I ain't hatin'.
I can see why people go nuts with this stuff.
That guy's got major talent.
This just hurts, you know?
I've had that before.
I used to draw stuff.
And I would draw like poses and stuff.
People would be like, you're just using that pose.
Someone else used that pose.
I'm just using this pose.
Oh.
Oh.
It's not a problem if people call you a copycat for something you wrote about first.
I can see that.
People call me a cat all the time.
Have me go.
Why is he so cute?
I don't know.
I don't want to be this cute.
It's a crime.
Even though I'm a person and cats are pets and mousebers.
I sure, I sure, I sure hope people don't think I eat mice.
I guess we're in the same boat, kiddo.
I think I changed at least half of books worth of content.
Even then, it's still too similar.
Looks like I'll just have to accept my fate.
But I guess being called a cat isn't all that bad.
As long as people don't assume you eat mice.
I'm done.
I'm done.
Excuse me.
Oh, you are the messiah.
Welcome.
I have to take this bracelet off the sternart.
Annoy me.
Get off me, get off me!
We're good.
We're fine.
I'm sorry.

She is here. She is in the archival room upstairs.
When she is concentrating on her work, she will ignore any and all phone call for several days.
Nice. Can you go get her in person then? Leaving this post is not in my programming.
And can I go myself? Of course. The archival room is accessible through the stairway behind me.
Gosh, I think.
Hello, very interesting archival room.
Coffee. Coffee is for grown-ups.
You know, Miko, you said you were a grown-up.
On authorised entry. Library card required for further access. Wait, what?
Library card required for further access.
No library card though. We're gonna get one.
This is a question for the headlamp.
Tell me to call her.
Are you heading to bed? Good night.
Have a good night.
Good night.
Thank you for stopping by the day's stream.
She is not picking up.
I figured.
Are you sure you can't just let me through?
Letting you through with that library card is against my programming.
What?
Even in an emergency, my program is not flexible.
I have not been tamed.
What if I just run?
What if I just run in with stopping me?
What's he gonna do, blow me up?
I thought the rules was not to hurt humans or any living creature.
I'm on my third cup of coffee.
I can't feel my limbs and stop drinking.
When I have to stay awake, I need to find out how this book ends.
You can read it the next day.
Wait, but the world is kind of ending.
Wanting to finish your book before it does.
Relatable.
Relatable?
Because the author and his beautiful clipping hurts.
I got a library card.
A library card.
He just played at me.
I don't think we should bother him.
What a jerk.
What a stinky poo poo head.
What a stinker.
Smells like kaka.
Street up.
Poopoo.
Love person.
Libraries up ahead, thanks.
Okay, that promises the least pain on your grave.
I do.
Um...
Oh, excuse me.
Wait, did I come from that way?
It's an elevator.
We have been here before.
Fish tank. It's a big fish tank.
Oh, hey there.
You have a lot of fish.
Yeah, I'm worried about them.
Huh?
Or something about how the square particle stuff just took out a major pipeline.
I guess I should take advantage of the running water while I still can.
The sink.
Big fish.
Nope.
Not looking for it's that water shortage.
Is there anything I can do in here?
Does he want this?
No?
No.
Anything else?
Anything else?
Are you here to purchase a copy?
No?
Favorite for grown-ups?
Grown-ups?
Yeah.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Grown-ups?
Yeah.
What does that mean?
It means people who aren't kids.
Kids?
Or aren't you a kid?
I'm a robot.
Right?
The technically I've been up here already.
Right?
Where do I get a library card from?

It suddenly appeared. It was missing for like a whole two weeks. Now it's right in front of me.
I can't find it. I have it.
Oh shh.
I did not feel good.
Burned.
Alright.
All my vets have been taken. I even put my cream on. I did all of that.
And I'm gonna light this candle.
Can you help me?
Here you go.
Oh, that was hot.
I'm working here.
How about my schedule?
That was a thought that was in my head and I said it all out.
I wonder what the author would do in this situation.
I thought this little blank usually references his work.
There's work here.
The barrens in there just reported another sighting of the particles.
The particles are commonly not here unusual at this point.
Those squares particles just took it out.
I don't know about that one.
I might have to put on water and it was...
...adaptable.
Alright.
And we have some more disruptions.
And Sector 8 of the city.
This is consistent with our earlier findings. Not good at all.
I can barely keep my eyes open.
Help me too.
How does a doctor's silver blank get that all out energy?
These are of a thermal functioning at a frightening rate.
The school damage from square particle anomalies is almost impossible to reverse.
Not a living person can touch them unless they have a death wish.
But if we're lucky, sometimes the squares go away on their own.
But not before taking away one of the robot's arms or legs or head.
Okay.
I cannot stop spinning.
Robot.
You're waiting to be repaired.
You're waiting to be repaired.
This one is an active.
This is so tedious.
I miss the good old days before our robot repairing robots broke down.
All robots have to be assembled by actual people.
But aren't you a robot?
No?
Do I sound like a robot to you?
Or really?
Your head is a TV.
What does that have to do with anything?
Nevermind.
Robot.
A lot of us have been sleeping.
Sleeping very well in light of recent events.
And the square particle stuck out a few of my robots, I think.
She's still asleep.
She's still asleep.
That's me.
Ah, so I thought I'd sleep some time.
Hello?
Oh, shoot.
But I know you would be here so soon.
I would've turned off the darn wall.
Hello there.
What about the weird security measures?
Oh, yeah.
They're holding something.
I don't know.
Can I help you with anything?
Yeah.
Do you know how you get a library card?
A library card?
No, there's a library for that to try.
I need it to see the library.
But I can't get through the library card.
But at the same time, she's the one who gives out library cards.
Really.
Yeah.
I'm just going.
Please get some Eve for me.
Okay, I'm okay.
I'll go to sleep soon, alright?
I'm fine.
We're almost done with the game, I think, right?
How much longer do you think we have?
How much more do we have?
I want to keep going.
If we're so close, let's finish it.
We could finish it.
It will finish this.
I'm fine.
That sounds like JoJo already.
I'm sorry you can't hear all that fuzzy.
Wait, I don't know.
I need to see the library card.
It won't be hard for me to get on.
Okay.
There.
You're also, I think.
Wait.
Shoot.
I forgot.
If I'm just a library bot.
I have a face recognition function.
My photo.
The card won't match you.
How much do I have to have a photo?
Keep a photo.
My face to your face.
That was a joke.
No, no, maybe you'll get lucky enough about the video.
First comes first.
I always find stories in the photo.
What's this?
I'm always looking out for stuff.
The shit with glittering glue.
You know how that feels.
I don't know any glitter.
You sure?
Yeah.
How much on do those?
I'll throw us during your hair.
I know I do a little bit.
I've been walking all over the world.
Yeah.
Imagine.
Do you get really tired sometimes?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, kind of.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I don't mind.
It's actually really pretty.
Yeah, this game is really great.
I'm glad that you think so.
Even when the sun's gone.
But it's still a beautiful place.
What does the world look like with the sun?
Oh.
Uh.
You know.
Some of the birds that I've met.
A little of us have actually seen it.
Oh.
Ironic, isn't it?
It was on the world's leading researcher.
While I just stay here and build robots.
They're the ones exploring the world.
I just write down the data.
Crunch numbers.
Generate graphs.
Right.
I've been seeing robots everywhere.
I thought it was because the world was too dangerous for most people to explore.
That's not far from the truth, actually.
But I know someone.
Still does this research for a second.
Oh.
Even after segments.
The land started collapsing and access.
But the more remote.
Uh.
There's a stretch.
You got it.
Here it is.
It became difficult.
We can finish an hour.
That's fine.
Let's finish this.
Because tomorrow we play stray.
And we get to be a cat.
Cat games.
The best kind of games.
Our game is calling you out.
It's true.
Drink water.
I've been drinking soda.
I haven't been drinking water.
I drunk all you an entire thing of orange juice today.
Oh.
Tomorrow's collab.
I forgot.
Okay.
I forgot.
I forgot.
I forgot.
Tomorrow we have a group collab with the adults.
There are some of the adults girls.
Yeah.
I'll watch them.
I'm 40.
Turn it over with the voices.
You don't have all of our streams of them.
Fun.
Yeah.
Tomorrow's collab.

Okay.
There rings thing you remember about how to keep
work the camera?
Let's see. When arranging the lens make sure that the thin lens is positioned between the 2 curved
ones.
Can I tell you about the camera?
The camera work it again?
Yeah, the thick lens should be positioned left for both the curved one.

Wow
In my experience, the kind of knowledge is usually recorded in some cryptic book.
But I haven't read anything like that before. Sorry.
I have a cryptic book.
These books are full of cool speakers.
Those are my manuscripts that others sent me as a head librarian.
It's my job to help them with the publication process.
But it really hasn't been sending me anything.
This is an icon.
I guess it does give me some extra time to work through this backlog.
To be honest, I'm a little behind.
Here is another one.
This is an crossing book.
He stopped sending me many things with a pile of Korean semicircles the other day.

I will never recognize the objects, at least.
9, 10, 45, 23, Thursday.
Very sketchy practice.
What the fuck happened?
Hey, I need this book.
It's actually a book lover.
Although this documentation
is primarily backed with black,
the leaves display incredible resistance
and exposes just in light.
These curious lands are more resilient, resilient,
and can even thrive in the metallic sand
and harsh climate of the land.
In the Glen,
you can also grow dark on top of the moss layer
without competing with the moss for resources.
Radiocarbon-dating fossils suggest
that these plants
would be the first lifeforms of the Glen Lake Outer World.
Cool.
A book is working out, isn't it?
Oh.
Thankfully, Dr. Silver points to you
with able to replicate our prototype.
On the right is an update sketch
of some modifications
of the external design.
More importantly,
we used a radical,
we used a radically different architecture
rather than micro-processors.
Due to the limited resources this time,
it still should be able to deliver
a label delivering the Lake Broadmasters' message.
The teams suggested that taming will last cause.
It's a bun.
It's a stack of paper.
My new script.
A full background.
But she did believe in the multiverse theory
regarding alternate verses.
She liked the probability
of the rolling of dice.
Searchingly,
I found that very easier and easier to believe,
but I could not describe it very well back then.
Nevertheless,
I still wrote it to the best of my abilities.
After all, it felt only right to honor
how hard this way.
There are six.
Which one did you encounter?
Four.
I've encountered four.
So that I won't sleep again.
The bridge is full of bottled water
and take-out boxes.
Work, work, work.
Work, work.
Click the scanner
and the printer.
I'm pretty sure you said something about
unupdated databases.
Unupdated databases.
Oh, man.
I see those here.
Work, work, work.
Work, work, work.
I keep a cover of everything that I published
for him in the archival room.
He didn't read some of it.
He didn't read some.
There are even illustrations.
Kids like pictures.
Right?
It's like a box back there.
And the painting is a box.
Hi, travel good night.
Thank you for stopping by today's stream.
I appreciate that.
Appreciate you.
Maybe...
Are you guys really trying to give me that?
To lengthen this?
I thought this game was going to be super short.
Like, not short.
I thought I could finish this game much faster.
But I get so distracted.
And then I don't even finish anything.
I'm ready yet.
Do you have any questions about books?
I can answer them.
I love books.
Haha.
It's about four to five hours to refresh it.
I thought I could.
I thought I could do that.
But I'm so slow.
I'm so slow.
Yeah.
Yes, I was only at the rest.
Can I share this strange journal?
Do you like this?
Oh, I did have this.
I think it's written in some kind of...
Swiss.
I moved my microphone something.
I'm leaning back.
Wrapped in a blanket right now.
Haha.
It was so cozy.
I was so cozy and comfy.
Haha.
I'm fine. I'm fine, thank you.
Damn mosquito.
I'm going to squish it when I get the chance.
He'll rule the day that he fucked with me.
I'll absolutely obliterate him.
I'll clap him with these shakes.
Haha.
Ow.
I think it's written in some sort of word.
I don't recognize it.
Oh my gosh.
It's a book.
It's not just any book.
Golly, which one is this?
Somewhere in the baron?
Oh.
We found it.
A safe.
Where is that?
To the cell?
In that case.
What do I have to do now?
And where is the journal?
Oh cool.
It might take a while though.
That's fine.
Excuse me.
Gosh.
You look really tired.
A little bit.
Yeah.
A little bit.
A little bit.
So we finished this game like next week.
Can I just add it?
Add it.
Add it.
Add it.
Add it.
I'm so tired.
I'm not finished yet.
So it's faster.
Four parts is insane.
Am I just slow and dumb?
Why am I so slow and dumb?
How could I be so slow and dumb?
How could I be so slow and dumb?
How could I be so slow and dumb?
How could I be so slow and dumb?
How could I be so slow and dumb?

How could I be so dumb and dumb?
How could I be so fast and dumb?
How could I be so slow and dumb?
How could I be so slow and dumb?
I can't remember the length of it.
I keep thinking that I will get through this really fast.
