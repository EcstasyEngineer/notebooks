00:00.000 --> 00:10.840
The earth was juvenile, barren in its infancy, then from dust and darkness, the lifeless

00:10.840 --> 00:18.160
silence was broken, the crust of the earth cracked and moored, and from the bed of creation

00:18.160 --> 00:21.880
within it rose the first family.

00:21.880 --> 00:27.480
Upon seeing the empty earth, they used the immeasurable power within themselves to form

00:27.480 --> 00:31.120
beauty in an empty canvas of the land.

00:31.120 --> 00:38.880
They lit the sky with stars, pulled the mountains from the ground, and filled craters with oceans.

00:38.880 --> 00:44.720
Among the divines, the sister Azira would colour the land's invertency, fill the blue

00:44.720 --> 00:51.680
oceans with life, and instil within these creations the potential to grow and repopulate.

00:51.680 --> 00:57.760
In her accomplishment, she would be known as the Goddess of Fertility.

00:57.760 --> 01:02.880
In time, Azira's creations would grow in intellect and complexity.

01:02.880 --> 01:08.920
From their scattered tribes, the gods took to guiding humanity with their superior knowledge.

01:08.920 --> 01:15.160
In this exchange, humanity gave them worship and devotion, the gods would shape the foundations

01:15.160 --> 01:21.880
of human civilization across the land in each celebrating their divine benefactor.

01:21.880 --> 01:27.880
The gods, confident that mankind could stand on their own, sought to create the heavens,

01:27.880 --> 01:32.680
a place where the gods could raise families of their own kind, as earth was no space for

01:32.680 --> 01:34.180
them to grow.

01:34.180 --> 01:39.480
They rightfully seeked the same prosperity that they offered for their own and left.

01:39.480 --> 01:45.040
Out of all the gods, it was Azira who could not leave humanity.

01:45.040 --> 01:51.860
She loved her creations, yet she also loved the gods.

01:51.860 --> 01:57.720
She left a piece of her divinity with her family in remembrance and remained on earth

01:57.720 --> 02:05.280
to live among humanity, not as a ruler, but as a watcher and caretaker.

02:05.280 --> 02:11.320
It would be after the gods departure that the long peace would end.

02:11.320 --> 02:16.560
With the imbalance of power, wars between the regions could not be prevented.

02:16.560 --> 02:23.640
Anger, strife, and hunger for power would taint the ego of man, and Azira's limited

02:23.640 --> 02:29.640
power could not restore the will the gods had left behind for humanity.

02:29.640 --> 02:36.240
In her perceived failure, Azira would seemingly disappear from the walks of history.

02:36.240 --> 02:41.440
It has been long theorized that the goddess still lives amongst us in secret.

02:41.440 --> 02:47.360
There has been a long time speculation that, throughout history, Azira has been guiding

02:47.360 --> 02:54.560
humanity in small leadership roles, humanitarian efforts in philanthropy, or using her power

02:54.560 --> 02:58.680
to prevent cataclysmic disasters.

02:58.680 --> 03:05.000
However she is, we can all rest easy that she is watching over us from a position befitting

03:05.000 --> 03:07.440
a goddess among men.

03:07.440 --> 03:13.040
Well, Billy, I think we all learned an important lesson here today.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.120
That's right, Papa.

03:15.120 --> 03:18.080
Whatever happens, we're all family.

03:18.080 --> 03:22.880
That's exactly right, Billy, and there's nothing more important than family.

03:22.880 --> 03:23.880
Oh, shucks.

03:23.880 --> 03:27.440
I'm so happy I have such a big happy loving family.

03:27.520 --> 03:30.640
I'd be such a sucker if I didn't have a family.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.640
Aw, Billy.

03:43.640 --> 03:49.640
It has been a few years since I came to the realization that I could no longer outrun

03:49.640 --> 03:52.240
the reach of mankind.

03:52.240 --> 03:58.240
Living among animals, I tried to run from civilization for as long as time would allow.

03:58.240 --> 04:04.840
I am content to play the role of a commoner among humanity, yet I am tortured still by

04:04.840 --> 04:08.240
loneliness, by desires.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.640
I cannot fight my needs anymore.

04:10.640 --> 04:17.400
I must find my place among the humans and start a family.

04:17.400 --> 04:24.440
In my inaugural efforts to integrate into modern society, it became clear that I lack

04:24.440 --> 04:29.440
the necessary knowledge to fraternize as humans do.

04:29.440 --> 04:37.080
With animals, it's so simple, yet with humans, my knowledge avails me no aid.

04:37.080 --> 04:42.840
Again and again, I accumulated countless attempts at courting a suitable mate.

04:42.840 --> 04:49.200
How could I, before my goddess of fertility, struggle in this venture?

04:49.200 --> 04:53.840
Yet seeing the progress humanity has earned themselves, astounds me.

04:53.840 --> 05:00.240
They have become creators in themselves, expanding upon the earth we had given them.

05:00.240 --> 05:06.560
The tiny seed I had planted all those eons ago, well how it blossomed.

05:06.560 --> 05:12.800
I had believed my heart broken beyond repair, but living as they do, I see now, I see now,

05:13.000 --> 05:17.640
that they don't need the wills of higher beings to find their own happiness.

05:17.640 --> 05:22.840
Perhaps this, in itself, was the will of the gods.

05:22.840 --> 05:31.200
I see now the beauty in the human spirit, for all its ugliness and evil, but also in its kindness and community.

05:31.200 --> 05:36.840
It is the dichotomy of these aspects that makes them worthy of my love.

05:36.840 --> 05:40.000
I only regret not growing alongside them.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.160
I must make up for lost time, for every kindling of my passion.

05:45.160 --> 05:51.560
I have found, I have endless love to give, and give it a shell.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.720
Any takers?
