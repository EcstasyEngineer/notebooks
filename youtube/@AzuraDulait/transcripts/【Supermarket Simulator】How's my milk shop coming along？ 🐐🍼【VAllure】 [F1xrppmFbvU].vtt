I'm not I don't really have much to do except for like my doctor's appointments on Mondays

21:04.720 --> 21:07.720

21:07.720 --> 21:09.720
It's like the only time I go outside.

21:10.720 --> 21:15.720
This is when I go to my doctor's appointment and the weather is really nice lately.

21:15.720 --> 21:17.720
The trees are growing.

21:17.720 --> 21:21.720

21:23.720 --> 21:24.720
I like going outside.

21:24.720 --> 21:30.720
It's really nice going on a walk feeling the nice gentle breeze on my skin.

21:34.720 --> 21:39.720
As long as it's not raining, it's fine rain on a Monday kind of sucks.

21:39.720 --> 21:40.720

21:46.720 --> 21:51.720

22:06.720 --> 22:07.720
Oh, that reminds me.

22:07.720 --> 22:08.720
I was literally trying.

22:08.720 --> 22:14.720
Okay, so I missed a package from I missed a package from the delivery and

22:15.720 --> 22:17.720
I had to call them as well today.

22:21.720 --> 22:25.720
I had to call them as well today and I called them and I called.

22:25.720 --> 22:30.720
They made me go on the website and they're like, oh, put in your your

22:30.720 --> 22:31.720
your tracking number.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.720
Put in a tracking number.

22:33.720 --> 22:37.720
And then all that telling me that my package can't be redelivered.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.720
I'm I'm so I'm getting upset.

22:40.720 --> 22:41.720
I'm upset.

22:41.720 --> 22:42.720
I don't want to think about that.

22:43.720 --> 22:48.720
I'm aggravating me.

22:48.720 --> 22:51.720
Just give me my give me my package, please.

22:51.720 --> 22:52.720
Thank you.

22:52.720 --> 22:55.720
And then they're like, oh, then ask us where is your package?

22:55.720 --> 22:56.720
Yes, where is it?

22:56.720 --> 22:58.720
I put it in the tracking number.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.720
Oh, it's nowhere to be seen.

23:01.720 --> 23:02.720
This does not exist.

23:02.720 --> 23:03.720
Like what do you mean?

23:03.720 --> 23:04.720
It doesn't exist.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.720
What do you mean?

23:06.720 --> 23:07.720
I don't know.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.720
I don't know.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.720
I'm aggravating.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.720
I do all that too.

23:27.720 --> 23:28.720
I love the rain.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.720
Honestly, I love the rain.

23:30.720 --> 23:34.720
But what I don't like about the rain is the location.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.720
City rain is gross.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.720
The city is gross.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.720
It's garbage everywhere.

23:41.720 --> 23:42.720
It's not clean.

23:42.720 --> 23:46.720
It's gross, filthy, filthy.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.720
Just things everywhere.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.720
I love the rain.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.720
It's been in dance in the rain, if I could.

23:55.720 --> 23:59.720
But it's really gross outside.

24:00.720 --> 24:04.720
Over.

24:25.720 --> 24:28.720
You know, I also have been forgetting to take my vitamins.

25:44.720 --> 25:48.720
Whoever said 7 you're funny because it's literally the level I was at

25:48.720 --> 25:50.720
I was literally at the number 7

25:54.720 --> 25:56.720
You're not supposed to be in the single digits

Didn't know that it was really bad until I went to my doctors and they were like oh your vitamin D levels are bad

26:08.720 --> 26:14.720
I'm like, okay, so what do I do about it go get over the counter vitamins. I said, okay

26:14.720 --> 26:16.720
I'm not sure about that

I'm not sure about that

And they have a limit, a cap limit of how much they can give you over the counter, the cap limit was 200 IU 200 200 can have any more than that, you know how do you know how much she gave me, can you guess how much IU she gave me IU caps she gave me for each cap.

30:17.560 --> 30:44.560
It's over 9000. How could this be?

30:45.560 --> 30:46.560
Sorry.

30:55.560 --> 30:59.560
He triggered a memory. That chatter triggered a memory. I'm sorry.

30:59.560 --> 31:22.560
Is that it? Is that everyone's guesses? 400, 500, 400, 500, 1,000, 500, 5, 100, 5,000.

31:30.560 --> 31:32.560
Is that all your guesses?

31:35.560 --> 31:40.560
Alright, so what they prescribed me was actually 50,000.

31:44.560 --> 31:48.560
50,000 IU. 50,000.

31:59.560 --> 32:09.560
50,000 IU.

32:10.560 --> 32:15.560
I feel like alive, right? Yeah, I'm alive. I'm okay.

32:16.560 --> 32:22.560
I have to take one every week. One cap a week.

32:23.560 --> 32:31.560
And I keep forgetting to take it. I suppose I took it on Friday on Friday, but I forgot.

32:34.560 --> 32:41.560
Friday passed and I was like, did I take this? I saw it sitting behind my TV and I'm like, did I take that?

32:44.560 --> 32:47.560
I'm like, no, I did not. I definitely did not.

32:47.560 --> 33:00.560
Yeah, every Friday I was supposed to take it. Now it's every Sunday now since I took it before I started the stream.

33:00.560 --> 33:22.560
Is there ever a bone marrow transplant? No. I hear it hurts and I hear you have to be awake for it.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.560
It sounds terrifying.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.560
It sounds scary.

33:35.560 --> 33:38.560
It's over 9,000 then literally.

33:38.560 --> 33:52.560
Keep your phone always with you. My phone is always with me. It's right here.

33:59.560 --> 34:02.560
It's right here. One second.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.560
One second.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.560
One second.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.560
One second.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.560
One second.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.560
One second.

34:31.560 --> 34:38.560
Yeah, that's how low. That's why you're not supposed to be in the single digits of your vitamins, especially vitamin D.

34:38.560 --> 34:55.000
And I found out that low vitamin B count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.

34:56.000 --> 35:01.000
I found out.

35:01.000 --> 35:08.000
I didn't know that.

35:08.000 --> 35:18.000
I found out that low vitamin B count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.

35:18.000 --> 35:28.000
I found out that low vitamin B count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.

35:38.000 --> 35:48.000
I found out that low vitamin D count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.

35:48.000 --> 35:58.000
I found out that low vitamin D count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.

35:58.000 --> 36:10.000
I found out that low vitamin D count can cause depression, anxiety, sadness, and so many other things that I had problems with.

36:29.000 --> 36:34.000
Help me! Help me!

36:34.000 --> 36:40.000
Help me!

37:04.000 --> 37:10.000
My calcium levels most likely very very low.

37:34.000 --> 37:40.000
My calcium levels most likely very low.

38:04.000 --> 38:11.000
My calcium levels most likely very low.

38:34.000 --> 38:40.000
My calcium levels most likely very low.

39:04.000 --> 39:10.000
My calcium levels most likely very low.

39:35.000 --> 39:41.000
Well now you guys get to hear it though because I fixed my, I officially fixed my mic settings.

39:41.000 --> 39:46.000
I'm so happy. I think I mentioned this yesterday. I'm so happy.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
Every time I went high pitch my microphone went and pick it up.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
But I think my microphone can now pick it up.

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
I think I'm good. I'm good for now.

40:05.000 --> 40:12.000
So now you can hear all my ranges because my microphone before couldn't pick up my laugh.

40:12.000 --> 40:17.000
I bet you guys still don't even really know what my real laugh is like.

40:17.000 --> 40:31.000
My real life is my, my, my, well I mean they're all my real laughs but I guess when I really laugh really really hard it goes up really really really high.

40:32.000 --> 40:39.000
If I laugh really really really hard my laugh becomes extremely high pitched.

40:39.000 --> 40:47.000
Thus my mic doesn't pick it up. Thus it sounds like I'm not responding to people but I'm busy laughing.

40:47.000 --> 40:56.000
So you can never hear it. All my previous streams whenever I laughed my microphone couldn't pick it up.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
No you don't want to hear that. You don't want to hear that.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
You don't want to hear that.

41:32.000 --> 41:39.000
You didn't turn up great. I'm so happy. I hope my microphone sounds okay.

41:39.000 --> 41:47.000
I feel like I could do a little better. I feel like if I cut out or dip or anything just let me know.

41:47.000 --> 41:53.000
I can easily fix it. Let me know. Let me know.

42:01.000 --> 42:06.000
You want a highest note? I could say Ara Ara.

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
And then a lowest note.

42:12.000 --> 42:18.000
You really need to hear it. My laugh.

42:18.000 --> 42:31.000
Quick so I'll make her laugh. Like a submarine radar.

42:31.000 --> 42:37.000
I wheeze when I laugh too hard. I snort when I laugh too hard.

42:37.000 --> 42:42.000
Or when something catches me off guard. I snort.

42:43.000 --> 42:51.000
It's brown and sticky.

42:55.000 --> 43:01.000
Poop. Poop. Poop is brown and sticky.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
Poop. Poop-o.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
Poop. Poop.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
Poop. Poop. Poop.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
Poop. Poop. Poop.

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
Poop. Poop. Poop.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
Poop. Poop. Poop.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
I'm sorry. I didn't like that emo.

43:36.000 --> 43:42.000
I like the red face emo a lot.

44:07.000 --> 44:32.000
I don't know why I like trolling and then feeling as if I annoyed you so much and then this face pops up.

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
It makes me laugh.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
I laugh every time I lose connection and you guys use this face.

44:42.000 --> 44:48.000
I laugh the entire time. It's so funny.

44:48.000 --> 44:53.000
It's so hilarious.

44:53.000 --> 44:58.000
I love that face so much.

45:02.000 --> 45:14.000
I think the only time I snorted was when I tripped the robot in stray.

45:32.000 --> 45:37.000
It's so funny.

45:51.000 --> 45:56.000
My side hurts.

46:03.000 --> 46:14.000
I'd rather you guys show disappointment in my stupid jokes.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Is that weird?

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Is that weird? Am I weird for that?

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Is that a weird thing?

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Is that weird?

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
If you guys laugh, I'm like, that wasn't funny.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Why are you laughing?

46:32.000 --> 46:42.000
But I take great pleasure when you are all disappointed in my dumb jokes.

47:03.000 --> 47:07.000
Help, I can't stop laughing.

47:10.000 --> 47:15.000
Am I an M? I don't know. I don't know. I don't think so.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
I don't know. Maybe to an extent.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
Any further than that, I'll probably get upset.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
I'll probably get a little ingy.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
I don't think I'm an M.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
Is it levels for you?

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Yeah, it's levels for me.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
To a great extent.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
She just likes being annoying.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
I do. I really do.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
I do like being annoying.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
I take great pleasure in it.

47:56.000 --> 48:01.000
Seeing the disdain on your face from my stupidity.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Is that so bad?

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Just straight disdain.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
You're supposed to comfort.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
I do. I comfort you after I annoy you.

48:23.000 --> 48:28.000
After I tease and annoy you, I comfort you after.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
Oh, was it?

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Glad you enjoyed it.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Is that a type of aftercare?

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Yeah, of course.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
It's got the zoomies.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
I did drink with some soda.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
So I have a lot of sugar in me right now.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I just cracked my thumbs.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
Why did the bike fall over?

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
The only reason why that made me laugh

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
is because I fell off the bike.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
The only reason why that made me laugh

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
is because I fell off the bike.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
The only reason why that made me laugh

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
is because I fell off the bike.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
How do you crack your thumbs?

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Oh, I pull them.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
I pull them or accidentally bend them.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
I bend them accidently.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Like I put my hand on the table.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
And if my thumb is folded in front of my palm,

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
like in front of the hand,

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
and then I put my hand down,

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
it cracks.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
I gotta do that.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
This doesn't look like a supermarket.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
We're getting there.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
We're gonna be in the supermarket.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
God, this is great, fine.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Let's get on over in the supermarket.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
We're gonna run out of supermarket.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
God, you're so impatient.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
You don't want to even want to talk to me.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Whatever.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Fine.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Sit and chat.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000

Hi, welcome in, welcome in. Thank you, Ran.

01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:17.740
Really, thank you so much for the red. How was your stream? What did you play?

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:20.740
Welcome in.

01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:40.740
It's very nice to meet all of you. My name is Azur Dulay. If you haven't already heard of me, I am your fertility goddess from Bialor.

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:44.740
Welcome in.

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:50.740
So if you need to go rest, rain, I appreciate it.

01:14:50.740 --> 01:15:04.740
I understand that if you have to rain and go, go eat, rest, drink water, eat food. Thank you so much.

01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:10.740
It was fun. I see you're getting milk.

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:15.740
I'm more like selling my milk.

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:20.740
If you would like to purchase some, you can purchase some.

01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:30.740
I can give you a discount.

01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:39.740
Now water is important. Why is water important? Are you thirsty?

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:52.740
I give cute girl discount.

01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:33.740
You'll get your turn chat. You'll get your turn. You'll get your little discount as well.

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:52.740
Eventually. What a goddess gotta do, what a goddess gotta do. Just gotta make some money.

01:16:52.740 --> 01:17:02.740
It's over.

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:10.740
$100?

01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:24.740
He looks suspicious. I won't question anything.

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:36.740
$200 for $299.

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:45.740
Am I in it? I am.

01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:59.740
$199.

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:25.740
Why does this FBI agent keep coming into my store? He's scary. He's scaring me. What does he need flour for?

01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:30.740
He's watching me.

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:34.740
He took sprints out. Did you get the milk out, Leia?

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:37.740
I am.

01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:47.740
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, you too. Milk and cheese, I see how it is.

01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:58.740
Oh, it's you again. Hi.

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:03.740
I really like that tank top.

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:15.740
Oh, thank you.

01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:25.740
Will you sell cereal too? Do you really want cereal with your milk? You want cereal, you just don't want my milk alone. Do you want cereal?

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:31.740
Here, I will avoid a pole.

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:40.740
And cereal.

01:19:40.740 --> 01:20:07.740
Is that it? Anyone else?

01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:31.740
My ear is ringing. Oh my god.

01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:42.740
cereal is called Chucky Pig.

01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:51.740
It looks like graham crackers in the shape of a bear.

01:20:51.740 --> 01:21:05.740
Chocolate flavor.

01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:13.740
Chocolate cereal with chocolate milk.

01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:34.740
You don't have chocolate powder, but it comes from a chocolate goat.

01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:46.740
Let me turn this off.

01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:52.740
Is this okay? Can you hear me?

01:21:52.740 --> 01:22:00.740
Can you hear me?

01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:09.740
Yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:13.740
I keep going back here.

01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:19.740
Because you love it here, that's why. You love it here.

01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:27.740
You love it here. You're obsessed with me.

01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:35.740
You need me. Just like how I need you.

01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:40.740
Yes?

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:48.740
Glad. Yay. Hey, can you hear me?

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:53.740
Let you go?

01:22:53.740 --> 01:23:06.740
You think I have a hold on you? I don't have to do anything. All I have to do is talk sweet nothings into your ear and you'll be back.

01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:18.740
You'll be back.

01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:23.740
I'll give you free reign.

01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:38.740
All of you are already mine. You already belong to me. What do I need to fight for?

01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:51.740
You don't want your goddess?

01:23:51.740 --> 01:24:00.740
Can't get over chocolate. Have you eaten cocoa puffs? I have. I'm not a big fan of cocoa puffs though.

01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:05.740
I do like Reese's puffs.

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:10.740
Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs.

01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:13.740
I've been about a chocolate famous.

01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:23.740
Reese's puffs, Reese's puffs.

01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:29.740
I can't watch the homies now. I keep coming back here.

01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:34.740
I'm sure the homies will understand.

01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:50.740
They might make fun of you and then they'll be back in here too.

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:57.740
Cherry goat cinnamon goat crunch.

01:24:57.740 --> 01:25:02.740
Goat goat puffs.

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:07.740
I like that a lot. Someone needs to draw those.

01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:19.740
My own personal cereal. Special cereal that you can eat with my milk.

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:27.740
But my favorite cereal is actually Captain Crunch.

01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:32.740
I burnt that up last time.

01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:39.740
It's Captain Crunch. Favorite flavor is peanut butter.

01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:47.740
Peanut butter. Captain Crunch. It's so good. I'll eat it without milk.

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:56.740
Just be careful with the roof of your mouth.

01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:15.740
Captain Crunch will destroy it. Absolutely destroy it.

01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:21.740
Lord in by the milk held by the siren voice.

01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:24.740
You like it?

01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:30.740
I mean, I can get even deeper into your ear.

01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:35.740
I can take over your mind.

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:38.740
But I don't have hypnosis.

01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:48.740
I can't do something like what the siren can do.

01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:58.740
Hypnosis is the milk.

01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:03.740
Who told you this?

01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:07.740
You're not supposed to know.

01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:15.740
Ow! My cup hit my tooth.

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:29.740
Now I have to eat you.

01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:50.740
I like all of Captain Crunch cereal.

01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:56.740
But my favorite cereal out of the Captain Crunch is probably the peanut butter.

01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:03.740
But I do mix it. Mix it up. Mix it up. Mix it up.

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:13.740
I'm so excited for more. I hope you can tell about it.

01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:19.740
We're going to be doing... Oh, I forgot to... I completely forgot to release that.

01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:25.740
I completely forgot. I'll do it after the stream.

01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:30.740
I completely forgot to release my schedule.

01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:36.740
Oopsie. You have to not cross my mind.

01:28:37.740 --> 01:29:03.740
I don't know what to do with you.

01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:09.740
I don't know what to do with you.

01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:16.740
I'm such a good streamer.

01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:30.740
I don't know what to do with you.

01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:35.740
I look a bit scuffed. No!

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:42.740
It's anything but the scuff.

01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:46.740
Why?

01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:52.740
I have a special ingredient to make my milk. Do you want to know what it is?

01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:59.740
Do you want to know? Do you want to know what it is?

01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:05.740
Yeah?

01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:12.740
Well, I think it's love. Now it's you.

01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:36.740
I'm back.

01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:41.740

01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:59.740
I'm back.

01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:02.740
I'm back. All the lurkers got terrified.

01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:08.740
All the lurkers who were not really listening.

Do it for the milk.

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.880
Do it for the milk.

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:47.880
Oh, do you actually want to know an actual educational...

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:51.880
an actual educational thing, though?

01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:55.880
Jokes aside.

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.880
Jokes aside.

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:09.880
Well, you see,

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:13.880
when women give birth, right?

01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:17.880
And they breastfeed.

01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:22.880
And there was a lady who...

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:24.880
who pumps her...

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:26.880
she pumps her breast milk.

01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.880
She pumps it.

01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:33.880
And she was really scared that it...

01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:36.880
she was really confused of why I kept turning pink,

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:38.880
like strawberry milk.

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:41.880
It's actually...

01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:44.880
we can actually produce strawberry milk.

01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:46.880
It's actually possible.

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:49.880
The reason for that is because

01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:53.880
a tiny bit of blood

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:55.880
gets into the...

01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:57.880
into the breast milk.

01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:59.880
A tiny bit of blood.

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:01.880
So...

01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:05.880
This is actually true.

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.880
This is a true fact.

01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:09.880
Don't...

01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:11.880
Just look it up. Google it.

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:13.880
Google it.

01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:15.880
You see?

01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:17.880
I could have been...

01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:19.880
I could have been...

01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:22.880
It's true.

01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:31.880
That's not true, Raymond.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:33.880
Like that.

01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:47.880
Did it taste like strawberry, though?

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.880
I mean, it can.

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:52.880
Sometimes it tastes a little sweet.

01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:56.880
Like it happens, too.

01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:00.880
Like it's 100% happened where it tastes sweet.

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:03.880
After all, you are still drinking milk.

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:10.880
I think it depends on her diet.

01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:13.880
On her diet as well, so...

01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:22.880
Blood milk and strawberry milk.

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.880
Strawberry milk.

01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:35.880
I see.

01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.880
I see.

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.880
Google it. Google it.

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:42.880
It's true. It can happen.

01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:50.880
He cursed strawberry milk.

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:54.880
Mmm.

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:06.880
Four.

01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:08.880
Two.

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:12.880
You know, if it wasn't for machines...

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:17.880
I wouldn't be able to do math.

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:26.880
Math is hard.

01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:32.880
Is it your blood?

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:34.880
Is it?

01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:36.880
Is it my blood?

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:39.880
I mean, it could be.

01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:46.880
But sacrifices are needed.

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:55.880
But is my blood red, though?

01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:58.880
Is my blood red?

01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:00.880
What if my blood is golden?

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:04.880
Are you sure it's my blood?

01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:07.880
Have you ever seen a goddess bleed?

01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:13.880
Have you ever seen a goddess bleed?

01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:20.880
Have you ever seen a goddess bleed?

01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:24.880
Tell me.

01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:38.880
What if it's acidic like an alien?

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:40.880
Am I an alien?

01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:42.880
Am I an alien?

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:46.880
Am I an alien now?

01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:55.880
No. Give that back.

01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:10.880
To expender. To expender.

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:12.880
To expender.

01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:24.880
Is that it?

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:26.880
I was only seven?

01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:38.880
I have cereal.

01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:48.880
Two.

01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:56.880
Do you think he's gonna get away with it?

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:00.880
Haha, you didn't get away with it.

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:02.880
You thought you could try to grab it before I take the prize.

01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:04.880
You thought you could try to grab it before I take the prize.

01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:06.880
You thought you could try to grab it before I take the prize.

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:08.880
Get off!

01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:24.880
Yeah, that's right.

01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:26.880
Yeah, that's right.

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.880
Yeah, that's right.

01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:30.880
Yeah, that's right.

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.880
I'm gonna buy my cereal.

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:34.880
Mm-hmm.

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:40.880
Yeah.

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.880
They're goddess.

01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:06.880
So don't be scared.

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:08.880
Don't be scared.

01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:27.880
It's illial.

01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:30.880
It's illial.

01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:35.880
What a friend.

01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:42.880
Consent is sexy.

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:44.880
Sometimes.

01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:49.880
Very sexy.

01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:58.880
Huh? What? What?

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:00.880
What happened? What happened?

01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:03.880
Huh? What?

01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:05.880
Mm-hmm.

01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:07.880
What?

01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:33.880
The area of cereal for the milk.

01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:35.880
Is it healthy?

01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:43.880
Cereal for the milk.

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:02.880
Mm-hmm.

01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:16.880
This is no cup.

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:18.880
What do you mean?

01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:25.880
Yes, eight dollars for the cereal.

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:27.880
Why? Because look.

01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:28.880
Look, look.

01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:30.880
It says market price.

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:33.880
Market price is six dollars and sixty-two cents.

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:35.880
We gotta make a little more than that, you know?

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:38.880
So it's wise to make it a dollar more.

01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:40.880
A dollar or two dollars more.

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:43.880
I mean, we're looking at the market price.

01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:45.880
Fuck this price. Whatever this is.

01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:47.880
We're looking at this.

01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:51.880
This is what it sells for.

01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:53.880
So we do a little more than that.

01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:57.880
Otherwise, I'd be making no money.

01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:00.880
I'd be broke.

01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:03.880
I'm gonna be a broke-go.

01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:08.880
You want me to be a broke-go to you?

01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:11.880
I believe you're getting crazy.

01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:26.880
I broke God's hands from earlier.

01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:55.880
I...

01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:02.880
I...

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.880
Boat for the milk.

01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:12.880
Milk for the cereal. The internal cycle of a syrup.

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:25.880
You're mistaking market price and cost.

01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:27.880
We're not paying attention to this.

01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:29.880
This is nothing.

01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:32.880
What do you mean? Mistaking?

01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:35.880
They're still buying it, aren't they?

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:37.880
Aren't they?

01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:40.880
They're still buying it.

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:44.880
I see no problems here.

01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:47.880
They're still buying it.

01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:52.880
If they had a problem, they wouldn't be buying it.

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:02.880
Are you going to the next day?

01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:04.880
Oh, right. Enter.

01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:12.880
Okay.

01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:25.880
So we have bread, we have milk, we have cheese.

01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:32.880
What else do we need?

01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:38.880
We need $550 to unlock.

01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:42.880
Oh, the special milk.

01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:44.880
Special milk.

01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:46.880
The fresher kind of milk.

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:48.880
We need this.

01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:50.880
That one right there.

01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:53.880
Extremely fresh.

01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:55.880
Delicious.

01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:57.880
Delicious? Delicious.

01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:00.880
Delicious milk.

01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:03.880
Delicious.

01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:05.880
Delish.

01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:08.880
Straight from the top.

01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:11.880
It's the milk that you can leave on the counter.

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:14.880
Right after.

01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:18.880
Purchase.

01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:20.880
We need this one.

01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:25.880
Do we have to buy this?

01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:29.880
Like in order to buy this?

01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:31.880

02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:34.900
You won't melt, you won't melt.

02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:39.900
Just a little, you refuse to fold, huh?

02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:45.900
I see, I see.

02:13:46.900 --> 02:13:57.900
A little baby boy scared, scared to accept your fate.

02:13:57.900 --> 02:14:14.900
Your loyalty should not bound, you cannot escape this goddess.

02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:20.900
Are you sure you want someone as useless as you?

02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:32.900
Your uselessness means nothing, because you are already of use to me, as long as I have your heart.

02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:49.900
Everything I ever wanted, each and every one of you.

02:14:49.900 --> 02:15:01.900
A piece for the phabias.

02:15:01.900 --> 02:15:16.900
I can't give you all a piece, did you forget that I can get really, really big?

02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:24.900
The bigger I can get, the more of you I can hold.

02:15:31.900 --> 02:16:00.900
Ah, so cute.

02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:29.900
You are all my precious little babies.

02:16:29.900 --> 02:16:33.900
And nothing can take that away.

02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:46.900
The only one that gets in your way is yourself, and all you have to do is let it go and accept your fate.

02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:07.900
What are you scared of?

02:17:07.900 --> 02:17:09.900
There's nothing to be afraid of.

02:17:09.900 --> 02:17:16.900
Mommy's here, mommy's got you, mommy's going to hold you.

02:17:29.900 --> 02:17:52.900
Yes, yes, I'll piece for the phabias.

02:17:52.900 --> 02:18:13.900
Melgue's for the phabias.

02:18:13.900 --> 02:18:32.900
Arra, ara.

02:18:32.900 --> 02:18:35.900
Your soothing voice helps me keep going.

02:18:35.900 --> 02:18:40.900
You are the sweetest woman in your generation and a blessing for a man's mental health.

02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:43.900
Thank you Azura.

02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:52.900
Wow, it's so sweet of you to say anonymous. Thank you for the $1 to happy. Thank you.

02:18:52.900 --> 02:19:21.900
So sweet.

02:19:21.900 --> 02:19:36.900
Oh, I have to sneeze.

02:19:36.900 --> 02:19:42.900
Oh my gosh, my eyes are watery.

02:19:43.900 --> 02:19:47.900
Don't die, don't die.

02:19:47.900 --> 02:19:52.900
Thank you for the $3 to happy.

02:19:52.900 --> 02:19:57.900
Thank you, thank you.

02:19:57.900 --> 02:20:02.900
Don't die, you must live, you must survive.

02:20:02.900 --> 02:20:06.900
I'm a survivor, I wanna make it.

02:20:06.900 --> 02:20:22.900
I'm a survivor, keep on surviving.

02:20:22.900 --> 02:20:39.900
Thank you for the blessures.

02:20:39.900 --> 02:21:07.900
Is that Leopold?

02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:17.900
I want to keep listening to you, but I need to go to sleep for work tomorrow. So conflicting. May I get a hug and kiss goodnight mommy?

02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:35.900
Thank you so much for the $1 to happy. I'm the late lover. Here's your hug.

02:21:35.900 --> 02:21:54.900
Good night.

02:21:54.900 --> 02:22:05.900
Do I kill you guys? Chat time.

02:22:05.900 --> 02:22:14.900
They're dead, they're dead.

02:22:24.900 --> 02:22:47.900
Thank you for the $1 to happy.

02:22:47.900 --> 02:23:06.900
It was my mouth, but I stood tall. I can wonder what other things are standing tall.

02:23:06.900 --> 02:23:34.900
Thank you for the $1 to happy.

02:23:34.900 --> 02:23:45.900
Thank you for the $1 to happy.

02:23:45.900 --> 02:24:08.900
Oh that's so bright, oh my eyeballs.

02:24:08.900 --> 02:24:18.900
Okay, I wanna see if I can buy that thing now or buy any level 9.

02:24:38.900 --> 02:24:57.900
I don't trust it. I feel like I'm playing Pokemon all over again. You know, when the game crashes, so you're so scared of your process being lost and when you play Pokemon on the DS, so you save it every 2 minutes.

02:24:57.900 --> 02:25:16.900
That's what I feel like right now.

02:25:16.900 --> 02:25:35.900
Because there's no warning when it crashes or anything, it just closes the game. That's it, just close. I've boop, gone.

02:25:35.900 --> 02:25:52.900
Better channel doesn't have our ASMRs. Well, yeah, it's unfortunate. I only had one ASMR though. I believe next week I'll be having another ASMR, but I think it's gonna be called ASMR.

02:25:52.900 --> 02:26:04.900
If you understand my grip, we gotta be more safe with the thickness that we do on here.

02:26:04.900 --> 02:26:20.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, see, yeah, see, yeah.

02:26:34.900 --> 02:27:00.900
Oh, she scared me. She scared me so bad. I don't think anyone else is gonna come in here. Yeah, she, yeah.

02:27:00.900 --> 02:27:22.900
Big toe.

02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:35.900
Anyone else? Nobody else? Anybody else wanna come in here? Anybody else? Nobody else? Ah, see? Alright, I see all this.

02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:52.900
And I closed door. Yay! And now it saves, right? I don't see it.

02:27:52.900 --> 02:28:11.900
We're like barely making any money with our milk.

02:28:11.900 --> 02:28:30.900
It stays.

02:28:30.900 --> 02:28:59.900
I hear. Oh. Since whole yapping. This goat mafia you see. I'm hungry. I wanna eat. I wanna eat food.

02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:24.900
Yeah, no more cookie eating for the ASMR.

02:29:24.900 --> 02:29:53.900
Nope. No toast today. Instead, I'm going to eat weyanya. Weyanya. I'm going to eat weyanya.

02:29:54.900 --> 02:30:10.900
Weyanya. Weyanya.

02:30:10.900 --> 02:30:34.900
FBI agents coming to have a taste of my milk. It's definitely chocolate.

02:30:35.900 --> 02:30:51.900
Why are there so many FBI agents in here?

02:30:51.900 --> 02:31:10.900
I hear the rumors about your strawberry milk. Hey.

02:31:10.900 --> 02:31:27.900
We just use a little bit of powder. A little bit of powder, you know?

02:31:40.900 --> 02:32:09.900
Can I hire someone to register? Is that possible? Oh, hiring.

02:32:10.900 --> 02:32:27.900
Aww. No, good to see you.

02:32:40.900 --> 02:33:09.900
How about we make this the last night and then we just sit and chat? Sit and chat. Sit and chat for a little bit.

02:33:10.900 --> 02:33:29.900
But I do want to eat.

02:33:40.900 --> 02:34:09.900
Oh, we already had a bread in cereal.

02:34:40.900 --> 02:35:09.900
Mmm. I'll take the goat milk entire stock and production and factory all together. It'll cost you.

02:35:10.900 --> 02:35:23.900
I don't think you'd have enough to sacrifice to own all of it, now would you? It might cost you more than an arm and a leg.

02:35:23.900 --> 02:35:52.900
Maybe your entire heart?

02:35:53.900 --> 02:36:19.900
How's the stream going? Really well. I'm enjoying myself. Very much so. Oh, thank God that was empty. Oh, my goodness.

02:36:19.900 --> 02:36:32.900
Oh, my goodness. Thank goodness that cup was empty.

02:36:32.900 --> 02:36:47.900
That was close. Anyone else? Anybody else?

02:36:47.900 --> 02:37:08.900
I'm going to save it for the next day. Save it just in case.

02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:36.900
I hear.

02:37:36.900 --> 02:37:59.900
Where's your timer for the mess?

02:37:59.900 --> 02:38:14.900
Do you think goat mom could crush chat if she wanted to? Yes, she can.

02:38:15.900 --> 02:38:25.900
And you'd perish. But would I? No, I wouldn't do that. Why?

02:38:25.900 --> 02:38:40.900
Because I need you. I need you. Just like how you need me. I need you.

02:38:40.900 --> 02:38:55.900
Well, it's with little babies. How else am I supposed to breed?

02:39:10.900 --> 02:39:39.900
How are the tables turned?

02:39:39.900 --> 02:39:46.900
What do you mean?

02:39:46.900 --> 02:39:53.900
Alright, let me grab me my food and I'll be right back.

02:39:53.900 --> 02:40:01.900
Play some sports with each other while I go be right back. Alright, I'm gonna be right back.

02:40:01.900 --> 02:40:08.900
I have this pretty screen.

02:41:31.900 --> 02:41:46.900
I have this pretty screen.

02:41:46.900 --> 02:42:01.900
I have this pretty screen.

02:42:01.900 --> 02:42:16.900
I have this pretty screen.

02:42:16.900 --> 02:42:31.900
I have this pretty screen.

02:42:31.900 --> 02:42:46.900
I have this pretty screen.

02:42:46.900 --> 02:43:10.900
I have this pretty screen.

02:43:10.900 --> 02:43:28.900
I'm looking at all of you playing all sports.

02:43:29.900 --> 02:43:37.900
I'm back.

02:43:37.900 --> 02:43:43.900
I have lasagna.

02:43:58.900 --> 02:44:19.900
I'm very good. I'm proud of you.

02:44:19.900 --> 02:44:29.900
Are you guys eating? I hope you all are eating.

02:44:29.900 --> 02:44:39.900
If you can't eat right now, I'll help you eat later.

02:44:39.900 --> 02:44:52.900
I need drinks. I still have the soda left over.

02:44:52.900 --> 02:45:03.900
Am I peaking?

02:45:03.900 --> 02:45:11.900
Is that better? Oh no. That's not what happened.

02:45:11.900 --> 02:45:38.900
That's not what happened at all. I know why I'm peaking. Every time I move my keyboard and my keyboard accidentally hits one of my equipment and turns the knob up or down.

02:45:38.900 --> 02:45:49.900
Oh my god, it was at 80. I am so sorry.

02:45:49.900 --> 02:45:56.900
Oh my god.

02:45:56.900 --> 02:46:07.900
My keyboard keeps hitting the knob and turns it up and I have to keep looking out for that. I moved my keyboard out of the way so I could put my plate down.

02:46:07.900 --> 02:46:22.900
Is that better? I'm so sorry about that.

02:46:22.900 --> 02:46:28.900
It scared me.

02:46:28.900 --> 02:46:35.900
It's fine. My ears are yours. I don't want your ears to be destroyed.

02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:51.900
If your ears get destroyed, how else are you going to listen to me? You'll be sad. You won't be able to hear my voice anymore.

02:46:51.900 --> 02:46:57.900
You'll go crazy. You'll lose your mind.

02:46:57.900 --> 02:47:08.900
Do you know how? Because you already got a taste of what my voice already sounds like. You like my voice. You love it. You will be hearing it.

02:47:08.900 --> 02:47:22.900
You wait for my streams. Even when I'm gone, you think about my voice. When I stream, you're happy. You like my voice. My voice is there. It's in your ears. You want to hear more.

02:47:22.900 --> 02:47:35.900
One day, you lose your hearing. You can't hear anymore. You can't hear. But you want to hear my voice. But you can't hear.

02:47:35.900 --> 02:47:52.900
Now you have the thought of what you used to know. All you can do is remember the voice in your head. My voice in your head. You think about it. About what you could do to hear my voice again.

02:47:52.900 --> 02:48:02.900
You do anything. Anything. You want to hear my voice. You want to hear my voice. You're losing your mind.

02:48:02.900 --> 02:48:27.900
You need to hear my voice. You have to hear my voice. Days go by. You're starting to forget. You're starting to forget. What my voice sounds like. You're gonna forget. You don't want to forget. You want to hear my voice. You want to hear my voice. You're losing your mind. You're going crazy. You want to hear my voice.

02:48:32.900 --> 02:48:42.900
Is that what you want to do? Is that what you want to go through?

02:49:02.900 --> 02:49:20.900
If you don't want that, take care of your ears. Tell me if my volume peaks. Tell me if it goes low. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience.

02:49:32.900 --> 02:49:33.900
If you don't want that, take care of your ears. Tell me if it goes low. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's the horror you want to experience. Tell me. Or unless that's

02:50:02.900 --> 02:50:16.580
the horror you want to experience.

02:50:16.580 --> 02:50:18.580
There you go.

02:50:24.180 --> 02:50:27.220
Help I'm a rock. Help I'm a rock.

02:50:46.580 --> 02:50:50.420
I'm already kind of deaf in one ear.

02:50:53.300 --> 02:51:00.420
That's all right. You have another ear. Another ear you'll need to take care of.

02:51:16.580 --> 02:51:32.580
I'll do my best to let you know. Careful eating mama. Clearly that is just way too up.

02:51:36.580 --> 02:51:38.580
I'll be careful.

02:51:38.580 --> 02:51:48.580
I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube.

02:52:08.580 --> 02:52:28.580
Did I post it yet? No I didn't post it yet. Excuse me. I can post it right now. Give me one second. I have to find it though.

02:52:38.580 --> 02:52:44.580
One second please.

02:53:08.580 --> 02:53:16.580
I sneezed. Thank you.

02:53:38.580 --> 02:53:58.580
Let me grab this. My brain isn't braining right now.

02:53:58.580 --> 02:54:14.580
My brain is kind of trying to remember where I put it but it's only in one place and I don't know why I can't remember that place.

02:54:28.580 --> 02:54:38.580
I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube.

02:54:58.580 --> 02:55:08.580
I'm in love with YouTube.

02:55:28.580 --> 02:55:38.580
I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube.

02:55:58.580 --> 02:56:08.580
I'm in love with YouTube.

02:56:28.580 --> 02:56:46.580
I did it. Yay.

02:56:46.580 --> 02:56:56.580
Do you want some Messiah? Open it up.

02:57:16.580 --> 02:57:32.580
I'm in love with YouTube. I'm in love with YouTube.

02:57:32.580 --> 02:58:00.580
Come on. You'd like it. You love it.

02:58:02.580 --> 02:58:22.580
You'd eat it.

02:58:22.580 --> 02:58:42.580
I'm a good girl. I'm the best girl.

02:58:52.580 --> 02:59:20.580
I'm a good girl.

02:59:22.580 --> 02:59:32.580
I'm a good girl. I'm a good girl.

02:59:52.580 --> 03:00:02.580
Oh God.

03:00:02.580 --> 03:00:12.580
I have a little square left. I've got to gather all of the crumbs together.

03:00:12.580 --> 03:00:20.580
The last bite. The last bite.

03:00:20.580 --> 03:00:36.580
It's pretty full of crumbs together.

03:00:36.580 --> 03:00:46.580
Yeah.

03:00:46.580 --> 03:00:58.580
Mmm.

03:00:58.580 --> 03:01:08.580
What kind of lasagna was it?

03:01:08.580 --> 03:01:14.580
Beef? Beef lasagna?

03:01:14.580 --> 03:01:24.580
I don't know. It's homemade lasagna. I don't know.

03:01:24.580 --> 03:01:44.580
I don't know about other kinds of lasagna.

03:01:44.580 --> 03:01:48.580
I don't know. She's going to move on to us next.

03:01:48.580 --> 03:01:56.580
Maybe.

03:01:56.580 --> 03:02:08.580
Beef lasagna.

03:02:08.580 --> 03:02:14.580
Move. Move. Move.

03:02:14.580 --> 03:02:40.580
Move. Move.

03:02:40.580 --> 03:02:50.580
How? How to do cow noise?

03:02:50.580 --> 03:03:18.580
How is it?

03:03:18.580 --> 03:03:24.580
I have really good at doing animal impressions. I never mentioned that in my debut.

03:03:24.580 --> 03:03:34.580
Because that was embarrassed. I'm sorry.

03:03:34.580 --> 03:04:02.580
But I get really loud when I do it.

03:04:02.580 --> 03:04:08.580
I don't know how to whisper to it. It's not possible.

03:04:08.580 --> 03:04:14.580
So just then that was probably extremely loud.

03:04:14.580 --> 03:04:20.580
I probably woke up someone.

03:04:20.580 --> 03:04:30.580
I don't know how to whisper. I have to use my entire vocal box to be able to do it.

03:04:30.580 --> 03:04:58.580
For a girl, you're especially good at sounding like a cow.

03:04:58.580 --> 03:05:16.580
How are you?

03:05:16.580 --> 03:05:22.580
I'm too embarrassed to do any other sounds.

03:05:22.580 --> 03:05:28.580
I'm so flustered. My face is burning. Oh my gosh.

03:05:28.580 --> 03:05:34.580
I could do a duck. I could do a duck.

03:05:34.580 --> 03:05:44.580
I could do chicken. I could do small birds.

03:05:44.580 --> 03:05:54.580
I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it.

03:05:54.580 --> 03:06:02.580
I didn't mention any of my impressions on debut because I knew I was going to get too embarrassed to do it.

03:06:02.580 --> 03:06:06.580
Then I was going to do it and I was going to mess up on doing it.

03:06:06.580 --> 03:06:12.580
Then I was going to be so embarrassed that I would want to perish.

03:06:12.580 --> 03:06:24.580
I didn't add it at all.

03:06:24.580 --> 03:06:36.580
Oh shit.

03:06:36.580 --> 03:06:50.580
We're too loud. We're too loud. We're too loud.

03:06:50.580 --> 03:06:58.580
Trying to do it and whisper is so hard.

03:06:58.580 --> 03:07:10.580
It's so hard. How do you whisper and make noises?

03:07:10.580 --> 03:07:20.580
Why? Don't tell him.

03:07:20.580 --> 03:07:38.580
Don't tell him.

03:07:38.580 --> 03:07:52.580
I can't do the rooster noise. The one that wakes you up in the morning because it's way too loud.

03:07:52.580 --> 03:08:00.580
There's a quiet one. There you go.

03:08:00.580 --> 03:08:08.580
How do you whisper? It's so hard.

03:08:22.580 --> 03:08:32.580
No.

03:08:32.580 --> 03:08:42.580
What a cute poem.

03:08:42.580 --> 03:09:04.580
Look at that.

03:09:04.580 --> 03:09:16.580
That one hurts.

03:09:16.580 --> 03:09:36.580
I'm a kitty.

03:09:36.580 --> 03:09:58.580
I'm a kitty.

03:09:58.580 --> 03:10:24.580
We used to yell at each other all the time.

03:10:24.580 --> 03:10:28.580
I miss him so much.

03:10:28.580 --> 03:10:46.580
We just go back and forth doing that to each other.

03:10:46.580 --> 03:11:06.580
I miss him so much.

03:11:06.580 --> 03:11:32.580
Hello. Hi.

03:11:32.580 --> 03:11:44.580
I didn't voice-act the cat and stray. The cat and stray is actually voice-acted and modeled after an actual cat.

03:11:44.580 --> 03:11:58.580
And he is a cutie. Such a cutie. Did you see him?

03:11:58.580 --> 03:12:18.580
I can never take the job of a real cat.

03:12:18.580 --> 03:12:34.580
I was meat stuck in my teeth.

03:12:34.580 --> 03:12:44.580
Did they hire cat voice actor? Not a real person but an actual cat.

03:12:44.580 --> 03:12:50.580
Thanks we got a real cat and let him meow into a microphone.

03:12:50.580 --> 03:12:58.580
I think it's the same cat that we also put the tape and stuff over.

03:12:58.580 --> 03:13:04.580
And the cat walked around with the stuff all over it.

03:13:04.580 --> 03:13:08.580
I liked the behind the scene video. It was very cute.

03:13:08.580 --> 03:13:30.580
Have you guys seen the video of the cat doing the stuff for the game?

03:13:30.580 --> 03:13:56.580
It's an actual kitty cat.

03:13:56.580 --> 03:14:04.580
Sorry to serve. I'll show you.

03:14:04.580 --> 03:14:14.580
Hi.

03:14:34.580 --> 03:14:46.580
Oops.

03:14:46.580 --> 03:14:58.580
Ignore that.

03:14:58.580 --> 03:15:26.580
Yeah but how do I make it?

03:15:26.580 --> 03:15:42.580
Is it lost? Work for me.

03:15:42.580 --> 03:15:58.580
I can't do that. It's so dumb.

03:15:58.580 --> 03:16:08.580
Close.

03:16:08.580 --> 03:16:22.580
Again you are going to fight over us.

03:16:22.580 --> 03:16:26.580
It's not what I want to move. It's not what I moved.

03:16:26.580 --> 03:16:32.580
Work with me. Work with me.

03:16:32.580 --> 03:16:38.580
Do you literally have the thingy up? It's not working.

03:16:38.580 --> 03:16:44.580
I changed it. Why is it not working? What happened?

03:16:44.580 --> 03:16:52.580
What the heck? What's happening? What can I...

03:16:52.580 --> 03:17:02.580
No.

03:17:02.580 --> 03:17:08.580
I did it. I'm so smart.

03:17:08.580 --> 03:17:18.580
Let's go. I'm intelligent.

03:17:18.580 --> 03:17:26.580
I'm so smart. Oh my god. You believe it how smart I am?

03:17:26.580 --> 03:17:34.580
I'm so smart. Is this too small? Should I make it bigger?

03:17:34.580 --> 03:17:42.580
Is this too small?

03:17:42.580 --> 03:17:50.580
This is a kitty cat.

03:17:50.580 --> 03:17:54.580
This is a cat that they have for the thingy. I don't even think you can hear it.

03:17:54.580 --> 03:18:06.580
Hang on.

03:18:06.580 --> 03:18:18.580
You can't hear it. I can't hear it.

03:18:18.580 --> 03:18:24.580
Sorry. I heard myself. My apologies.

03:18:24.580 --> 03:18:38.580
Ew. I heard myself.

03:18:38.580 --> 03:18:44.580
How do I move it?

03:18:44.580 --> 03:18:46.580
Can you hear it now?

03:19:14.580 --> 03:19:40.580
Now there. I went through all that for a really short video.

03:19:40.580 --> 03:20:02.580
Today we are group.

03:20:02.580 --> 03:20:10.580
I can't really watch it alone.

03:20:10.580 --> 03:20:26.580
I'd watch memes and videos with you guys.

03:20:26.580 --> 03:20:48.580
I can't hear it.

03:20:48.580 --> 03:20:58.580
The fat cat. Big chunkers.

03:20:58.580 --> 03:21:06.580
Where the cats paid? I think the owners were paid.

03:21:06.580 --> 03:21:16.580
I think the owners got paid for their kitty cat audition.

03:21:16.580 --> 03:21:36.580
Maybe we can add that to a dono.

03:21:36.580 --> 03:21:40.580
Where you guys submit your funniest memes to me.

03:21:40.580 --> 03:21:52.580
I'll have someone go through them before sending them to me.

03:21:52.580 --> 03:22:00.580
Just in case you guys send me something out of this world.

03:22:00.580 --> 03:22:10.580
I don't trust you to be good but I don't trust all of you.

03:22:10.580 --> 03:22:32.580
I don't trust you to be good but I don't trust all of you.

03:22:32.580 --> 03:22:44.580
If I don't laugh at your memes don't take it the hard way right?

03:22:44.580 --> 03:22:50.580
There's only so many things that can really make me laugh and my humor is kind of lost.

03:22:50.580 --> 03:23:00.580
I laugh at the dumbest things and I really like people falling.

03:23:00.580 --> 03:23:10.580
I don't know it's hard to explain. It's like a specific kind of funny.

03:23:10.580 --> 03:23:16.580
It's like people get caught doing something they're not supposed to.

03:23:16.580 --> 03:23:34.580
Other people laughing about it.

03:23:34.580 --> 03:23:38.580
Caught lacking not me.

03:23:38.580 --> 03:23:48.580
As long as they don't get seriously hurt is this fine with me.

03:23:48.580 --> 03:23:58.580
As long as someone gets horrendously hurt or really badly hurt.

03:23:58.580 --> 03:24:08.580
Make me go oof.

03:24:08.580 --> 03:24:11.580
But every now and then it's fine.

03:24:11.580 --> 03:24:14.580
You know how when you're like scrolling memes.

03:24:14.580 --> 03:24:20.580
Scrolling the memes and you're scrolling and scrolling.

03:24:20.580 --> 03:24:30.580
Ha ha hee hee every now and then and then you get hit with a random fall meme.

03:24:30.580 --> 03:24:40.580
It gives you a good laugh.

03:24:40.580 --> 03:24:43.580
Do you want to scroll through my tiktok?

03:24:43.580 --> 03:24:52.580
Well if we scroll through tiktok it will be on the new account which I haven't really been on.

03:24:52.580 --> 03:25:03.580
I just like set it up because I was thinking of doing it like for like a regular satsudan.

03:25:03.580 --> 03:25:10.580
Just a sit chat and watch memes.

03:25:10.580 --> 03:25:13.580
I did not take my med.

03:25:13.580 --> 03:25:21.580
I'm going to do that now.

03:25:21.580 --> 03:25:27.580
Also busy eating.

03:25:27.580 --> 03:25:47.580
Like junkers.

03:25:47.580 --> 03:26:02.580
I'm taking it.

03:26:02.580 --> 03:26:11.580
I took it.

03:26:11.580 --> 03:26:16.580
I was eating.

03:26:16.580 --> 03:26:23.580
See be proud of me because I remembered.

03:26:23.580 --> 03:26:31.580
See proud of me I remembered on my own.

03:26:31.580 --> 03:26:52.580
I remembered.

03:26:52.580 --> 03:26:55.580
Do you like waffles?

03:26:55.580 --> 03:27:02.580
And then you have to say yeah we like waffles.

03:27:02.580 --> 03:27:21.580
Do you like waffles?

03:27:21.580 --> 03:27:41.580
Do you like pancakes?

03:27:41.580 --> 03:27:46.580
Do you care to get a mouthful?

03:27:46.580 --> 03:27:50.580
It's so old.

03:27:50.580 --> 03:27:52.580
Someone knows.

03:27:52.580 --> 03:27:58.580
Someone knows.

03:27:58.580 --> 03:28:10.580
Someone knows.

03:28:10.580 --> 03:28:17.580
Do you like waffles?

03:28:17.580 --> 03:28:20.580
Yeah we like waffles.

03:28:20.580 --> 03:28:34.580
I like the sign.

03:28:34.580 --> 03:28:41.580
Do you care to get a mouthful?

03:28:41.580 --> 03:28:49.580
Do you care to get a mouthful?

03:28:49.580 --> 03:28:54.580
Do you like waffles?

03:28:54.580 --> 03:29:01.580
Do you like french toast?

03:29:01.580 --> 03:29:15.580
Do you like french toast?

03:29:15.580 --> 03:29:18.580
Is there your age is showing?

03:29:18.580 --> 03:29:21.580
Trust that song does not show my age.

03:29:21.580 --> 03:29:22.580
It does not.

03:29:22.580 --> 03:29:26.580
Not one bit.

03:29:26.580 --> 03:29:34.580
Not one bit at all.

03:29:34.580 --> 03:29:35.580

03:29:45.580 --> 03:29:49.580
He does not care if he's wasting water.

03:29:49.580 --> 03:29:55.580
He likes to push the handle and watch water go down.

03:29:56.580 --> 03:29:57.580
He's a cat.

And you will suck my toes.

03:39:17.800 --> 03:39:25.800

03:39:47.800 --> 03:39:55.800

03:42:17.800 --> 03:42:23.800
I am back.

03:42:48.800 --> 03:42:55.800
I would never abandon you. Never. Never abandon you.

03:42:56.800 --> 03:43:03.800
I would never abandon you. Never. Never.

03:43:15.800 --> 03:43:19.800
It's okay, don't be scared. Mommy's back now.

03:43:19.800 --> 03:43:32.800
You don't get the milk as broke. I give it to you every day. Are you ever gonna get tired of it?

03:43:49.800 --> 03:43:54.800
No, I don't.

03:44:19.800 --> 03:44:26.800
Never. Never. Never.

03:44:26.800 --> 03:44:32.800
It won't leave again, right?

03:44:32.800 --> 03:44:37.800
If I do leave, right?

03:44:37.800 --> 03:44:45.800
It is only going to be for a little while. Only for a short while, yeah?

03:44:46.800 --> 03:44:53.800
It's just a short while, and you guys can wait for me, right?

03:44:53.800 --> 03:44:58.800
Mommy has to go every now and then.

03:45:03.800 --> 03:45:07.800
Mommy has to.

03:45:08.800 --> 03:45:17.800
Mommy is going to be gone for the next two days, and she'll be back. Don't worry.

03:45:17.800 --> 03:45:22.800
Mommy will be back on Wednesday.

03:45:22.800 --> 03:45:27.800
On Wednesday, you guys can wait till then, yes?

03:45:38.800 --> 03:45:43.800
No.

03:45:58.800 --> 03:46:05.800
Today is a period. There is no misery. You guys will be fine.

03:46:05.800 --> 03:46:16.800
I am not abandoning you. Azra has things to do on those two days. Mondays and Tuesdays are very busy days for me.

03:46:19.800 --> 03:46:26.800
Very busy days, and then you have me Wednesday all the way to Sunday.

03:46:26.800 --> 03:46:32.800
So many things planned for you guys. So many things.

03:46:35.800 --> 03:46:45.800
You're not getting abandoned. No one is getting abandoned.

03:46:45.800 --> 03:46:54.800
Mommy is taking care of her health for you. If mommy doesn't take care of her health, there will be no mommy.

03:46:54.800 --> 03:47:02.800
If mommy doesn't take care of her health, there will be no mommy.

03:47:25.800 --> 03:47:30.800
Mommy is crying.

03:47:31.800 --> 03:47:36.800
Mommy is crying.

03:47:43.800 --> 03:47:50.800
In the meantime, while you all wait for me to come back, you can send me sweet, sweet morals.

03:47:50.800 --> 03:48:03.800
You can send me morals, sweet messages, like there's letters to me, and I'll read them, and I'll go over them, and I'll heart them, so I know that I read them.

03:48:07.800 --> 03:48:14.800
Okay, send me morals. That's fine. I'll take your morals.

03:48:15.800 --> 03:48:24.800
I'm not really bothered by all the other morals. I just wanted to talk about it a little bit, that it was silly. That's all.

03:48:28.800 --> 03:48:32.800
And I'll be the last time I talk about those morals, alright?

03:48:35.800 --> 03:48:37.800
That is the last.

03:48:38.800 --> 03:48:56.800
But other than that, I have received so many kind morals from so many of you already, and I feel so bad that I haven't responded to some of them, but I have given a lot of hearts to them.

03:48:56.800 --> 03:49:01.800
I think I was told that you guys can still see when I heart a moral.

03:49:08.800 --> 03:49:10.800
I think.

03:49:26.800 --> 03:49:31.800
So, send me your sweet words, and I'll listen to them. I'll read them.

03:49:32.800 --> 03:49:40.800
I started responding to really old morals that I didn't respond to like 14 days ago.

03:49:41.800 --> 03:49:49.800
I think I'm now in the 12 days ago ones, so it's taking me time, but I'll get through it.

03:49:50.800 --> 03:49:52.800
I'm so sorry.

03:50:02.800 --> 03:50:13.800
Yeah, so, you can like literally see, I think, a few morals that I made public, I think.

03:50:14.800 --> 03:50:26.800
If you like scroll down the moral page, you can like scroll down. You can see the ones I have publicly responded to, so that you guys do not ask me the same questions over and over again.

03:50:26.800 --> 03:50:44.800
I'm sorry if I don't answer some questions, but I get asked some questions like 20 times already and counting, so I just give it a heart and then I go past it.

03:50:44.800 --> 03:50:55.800
It's been 84 years.

03:50:59.800 --> 03:51:02.800
Read material as not to miss you.

03:51:03.800 --> 03:51:12.800
If you guys haven't seen some of my vans or my past dreams, you can go take a look at those.

03:51:13.800 --> 03:51:18.800
There's also the Patreon. You can visit the Patreon.

03:51:20.800 --> 03:51:22.800
You can go in there.

03:51:23.800 --> 03:51:30.800
There's also like in the future there will be other videos. There's as more download on the Twitter if you couldn't find that.

03:51:31.800 --> 03:51:39.800
There's that. There's also my art that I do on the old. There's so much material already out and ready for you.

03:51:40.800 --> 03:51:47.800
So if you really want to get that material, you know where to visit. Just check out in the description below.

03:51:49.800 --> 03:51:55.800
It's not the same. How is it not the same? It's me. It's all me.

03:52:00.800 --> 03:52:09.800
You can also buy my merch, buy the merch, and you can literally have me closer to your heart than ever before.

03:52:30.800 --> 03:52:45.800
It's inevitable, sadly.

03:52:45.800 --> 03:53:03.800
I might have to do more on the VOD Squad since my hour is at Oracle Chance. That's perfectly fine. I don't mind.

03:53:04.800 --> 03:53:11.800
Whenever you have the time, you'll always bop in because I believe in your loyalty. I believe in it.

03:53:12.800 --> 03:53:21.800
Don't worry. I believe in you. And I'll always be streaming for you.

03:53:21.800 --> 03:53:34.800
A bottle of drool.

03:53:34.800 --> 03:53:44.800
I'm glad I got a bit of the stream. Glad to have you here. We're just about to end it though.

03:53:45.800 --> 03:53:52.800
We're going to pop in and raid Marseille. Sweet baby Marseille.

03:53:52.800 --> 03:54:03.800
And she's doing a karaoke stream today, I think. Yeah, she's doing a karaoke stream.

03:54:03.800 --> 03:54:13.800
To get to hear her sing, because I can't. Not yet.

03:54:14.800 --> 03:54:21.800
And you to hear her sing, you can hear her sweet little voice.

03:54:22.800 --> 03:54:28.800
I'm actually excited to listen to it a little bit.

03:54:33.800 --> 03:54:42.800
You'll be waiting for my karaoke one day? Yeah, I'll do a karaoke stream.

03:54:43.800 --> 03:54:48.800
I know tons of songs already.

03:54:48.800 --> 03:55:04.800
Maybe, but it'll probably be an unarchived, however you say it, stream so that I don't get smacked with anything bad.

03:55:05.800 --> 03:55:11.800
It sums to radio. That'd be fun.

03:55:12.800 --> 03:55:18.800
I would have to learn a bunch of songs in some long language.

03:55:18.800 --> 03:55:34.800
He is irate.

03:55:35.800 --> 03:55:40.800
Like the Stardew Valley. Stardew Streams aren't karaoke enough.

03:55:41.800 --> 03:55:51.800
They were, but because they weren't marked as so, I got hit.

03:55:52.800 --> 03:55:59.800
I got copyrighted in that stream, in both of them.

03:55:59.800 --> 03:56:10.800
So we got to be careful in normal streaming.

03:56:11.800 --> 03:56:15.800
I'm probably going to get hit for playing that one jingle just for a little bit.

03:56:16.800 --> 03:56:22.800
So I'm probably going to go and mute that section of the stream.

03:56:23.800 --> 03:56:27.800
Because I completely forgot when I played it.

03:56:27.800 --> 03:56:34.800
Oopsie, I forgot, I forgot, I'm stupid.

03:56:45.800 --> 03:56:48.800
Yeah, I better be safe than sorry, yeah.

03:56:49.800 --> 03:56:56.800
I gotta stop forgetting, I gotta remember, but I do just like singing some jingles that pop into my head.

03:56:57.800 --> 03:56:59.800
I'm sure you never know, yeah.

03:57:00.800 --> 03:57:07.800

You have the other girls you can watch and enjoy.

03:57:34.800 --> 03:57:36.800
Watch my little babies, okay.

And I'll see my schedule and what we have planned for the week.

03:58:04.800 --> 03:58:09.800

03:58:19.800 --> 03:58:21.800
Bye bye.

Good night Daddy.
