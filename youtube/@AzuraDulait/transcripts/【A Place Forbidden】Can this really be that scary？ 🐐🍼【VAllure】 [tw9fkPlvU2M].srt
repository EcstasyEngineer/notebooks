00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
what

39
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
what

40
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
what are you doing here

41
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm a little too late

42
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm a little too late

43
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm a little too late

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
alright

45
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
why

46
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm wondering how much I'm going to be

47
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I was setting up

48
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:57,000
stuff for today. I added the merch thingies on there. You see that? On there. Look at that. Right there.

49
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I added the merch and I added alerts and a bunch of new things. It was really hard trying to set it all up.

50
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So I'm glad it went okay.

51
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

52
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
As I believe I am not. So I'm 20, 30. What is called your book?

53
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Or if my bullies wrote in that. I never amount to anything.

54
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Your amount to so much more. Do not believe your bullies. They mean nothing.

55
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Alright, you are everything and you are what?

56
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I already want you to be.

57
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You are great. You are amazing.

58
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And you're all good boys and good girls.

59
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oops. Yeah, yeah.

60
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Come on. Are you okay? I'm okay. Just a lot of energy. A lot, a lot, a lot of energy. I'm sorry.

61
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm having like a bit of issue on Twitter at the moment where people are sending me art or um, they're putting the tag in their art and stuff.

62
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Unfortunately, when I click on the tags, a lot of the art and um, memes and stuff that you guys sent me, some of it do not appear in there.

63
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So I'm really sorry if I missed some of your art and stuff.

64
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm really sorry. I'm so sorry.

65
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So I do get some of your stuff, but I have to like literally be sent some stuff that get unseen.

66
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So Twitter has hit you with anything or you know, they're probably not letting you, your hashtags get seen.

67
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Unfortunately, Twitter, Twitter being Twitter, yeah, yeah, yeah. I agree.

68
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Sorry, I do not take DMs. They have no clothes.

69
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I know that's what the hashtags are for, but don't worry.

70
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We'll sort it itself out, I'm sure. We'll sort it itself out.

71
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It helps for people to comment under posts with the tags, weird Twitter thing. I didn't know that.

72
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Maybe it does. I know when some people comment, that's how I end up seeing some of the posts.

73
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Um, so I end up seeing it only because someone else responded or retweeted that, so I end up seeing it.

74
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh, that's me! Understand.

75
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah, it seems a bit ginky today. Very ginky.

76
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Here you go, yo, yo, yo.

77
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Don't let Michael Kong go.

78
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Those eyes are very hypnotic, are they?

79
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Have you eaten today, Azu? Have I eaten today?

80
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah, yeah, no, I haven't eaten.

81
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'll eat, I promise, I promise, I promise.

82
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I promise, I promise, I'll eat, I'll eat, I'll eat. I have more cookies, does that count?

83
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,000
More cookies. I had cookies. I kind of ate them before I started, so I only have one left.

84
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't have, no, no, eat actual food.

85
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Fine, fine, alright, I'll eat something, I promise. I promise, I promise.

86
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yes, I pinky promise, I pinky swear.

87
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You guys don't want your astronomy? Please don't, no!

88
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
My bag, my bag, my bag. Please stop. I don't do it.

89
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's not worth it. It's not, I swear, it's not worth it.

90
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yes, after a stream, I'll eat a proper meal.

91
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Am I too close? Let me back up. E.

92
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Money, money, close.

93
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
If you pass out, we're going to be upsetty spaghetti.

94
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,000
No, I won, I promise, I promise, I'll be fine. I've been drinking lots of water.

95
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Aren't you proud of me? Water.

96
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I have a fan on, so let me know if the fan is bothering the mic, okay?

97
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Thank you. This is the first fan I've ever had. I've never had a fan before.

98
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I've had an AC, but that broke, so I don't have AC. It's currently still in my window, broken.

99
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It doesn't work. I used to hate it so much, because every time I turned on the AC, it would like literally turn off my power.

100
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm not used to my own alert.

101
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Water is important. Yes, I'm migrating.

102
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And they're fine, they're my fans now. Yay! And I appreciate every last one of you.

103
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Thank you so much for the subscriptions.

104
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Is that what they call them? Subscription? Does that sound weird, or is it just subscribers?

105
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Is subscriptions weird, or is subscribers better?

106
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So subscribe! If you're not subscribed, subscribe!

107
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Smash that like button. Is there still a bell?

108
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And click on that little bell, or something like that. Is it like that?

109
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah, there was a big purge. I had 4k, and then it died.

110
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I came back and I had 2.8k. Wow, that was massive purge. It was a big, big purge.

111
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's alright, I don't mind. I'm having fun just hanging out with you guys. I don't mind this at all.

112
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm actually really procrastinating right now. I'm really scared to play the game.

113
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm procrastinating.

114
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Am I good with horror at all? No.

115
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay, let's put it this way. There was a game that I played a long time ago.

116
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I played this game. I was suggested to play this game, and I'm not good when it comes to feeling like I'm being chased.

117
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And it got up to that part in the game, and I screamed so hard that I started drooling.

118
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I was screaming nonstop, and I was drooling and screaming and drooling.

119
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I thought it would be fun if I got a heart monitor to track my heart rate.

120
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Because, low and surprised, I didn't mention this yesterday, but I actually have, when I said towards the end of the stream, I said that I take medication.

121
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yes, one of the medications is actually for my heart.

122
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So that would be really interesting if I got a heart rate monitor.

123
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So I put it on the wishlist.

124
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'll be okay. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll be okay. I'll be okay.

125
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That's what the medication is for.

126
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I think I was fighting for her life. I was. I really was, and then I didn't even get past the first part of the game.

127
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And then someone told me that that part of the game was actually the tutorial.

128
00:19:49,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Some time later, it was the tutorial. I haven't even gotten it to the actual game, and I never opened the game again.

129
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The biggest chance is that I'll probably cry.

130
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'll probably start weeping and crying. And if anything, I'll probably ask one of the gen-mates to help me.

131
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Please, please, someone, anyone come in here and comfort me.

132
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Maybe hopefully one of them will come help in, you know, give me some good old slap on the back, you know.

133
00:20:47,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I know some goats who do that do faint, but I don't know.

134
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I have fainted before, so I think good gods can faint.

135
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yeah, I'll be super bored.

136
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm brave. I'm sure this game isn't that scary. I'm sure it's fine.

137
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm sure it's okay, and I'm gonna get right through it and be just fine.

138
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm so ready. I'm so ready. I'm so excited to play this game. I'm gonna do amazing things.

139
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That's right.

140
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Well, hello everyone who's just now coming and welcome and hi, hi, hi.

141
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I hope all of you have been well yourselves, yes? You all had a good day. You've all eaten breakfast, lunch or dinner.

142
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Brush your teeth.

143
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Showered.

144
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

145
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:11,000
That's right. That's right. That's what I call good boys and girls.

146
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Nyeom, nyeom, nyeom, nyeom, nyeom, nyeom, nyeom, nyeom, nyeom, nyeom.

147
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

148
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
My God, is that a sword to lay? Yes it is! It's me, a sword to lay.

149
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Okay, the fertility goddess, Apia Lojas, Gen 1, and Dolce.

150
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Why is the first king me streaming a horror game?

151
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I don't know, I thought I like, I wanted to add a little spiciness to it.

152
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You know, to the weak, little spicy.

153
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
A little bit of spice.

154
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Because we're gonna be biving the rest of the week, you know, chilling, biving.

155
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I really wanted to say, there was a lot of medication that I was on for my stomach.

156
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Because they found like internal, you know, internal bleeds and stuff.

157
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And some issues with my stomach and yadda yadda yadda erosion, yadda yadda yadda, you know, ulcers, yadda yadda yadda.

158
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
All of the whatnot, blah blah blah.

159
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I was on some really heavy medication.

160
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Some butt medication.

161
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And it was really, it was really making me super woozy.

162
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I was being really, really slourish.

163
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It made me tired, really sleepy.

164
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But yay, I just got a notice from my doctor that I don't have to take them anymore.

165
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And the one thing that those medications did to me that I was kind of a little sad and disappointed on,

166
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I was on that medication for about a year, a whole year I was on that medication.

167
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Or like close to a year, not really a whole year.

168
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But I was on that medication for a long time.

169
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But what I couldn't do well on that medication and taking oral medication as well,

170
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
because I had to take both for the stomach and butt medication.

171
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
A booty, booty medication.

172
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I couldn't drink. I couldn't have alcohol.

173
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I couldn't drink for a whole like almost a year.

174
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I wasn't allowed to drink.

175
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I wasn't allowed to have all the alcohols. I was so sad.

176
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And now, now I'm able to drink again.

177
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yay! I'm so happy. It's been so long.

178
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yay!

179
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
We're off the land, yay!

180
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
We're so lonely, healing, slowly.

181
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I still can't eat certain things or make me go blah, but I'm slowly healing.

182
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Yeah, that means streaming, that means drinking streams are good to go.

183
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Yeah, and I wanted to celebrate a little bit with everything that's happening.

184
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So, I'm probably gonna go do a bit of drinking on the, I think it's the 8th.

185
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I'm probably gonna do a little bit of drinking.

186
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So I might come back for super, I think we're playing in supermarkets and later,

187
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I might be a little a little bit dizzy.

188
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Welcome back.

189
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Little tipsy.

190
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's me celebrating with my fans, me getting off medication and stuff and all the things that I missed out on.

191
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Celebrate from now, come on!

192
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Celebrate from now, come on!

193
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
What's my favorite drink?

194
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
My favorite drink is soju. Actually, I like soju a lot.

195
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm not keen on the really, how you call it, bitter, bitterness of drinks.

196
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I have an extreme sweet tooth, like a really bad sweet tooth.

197
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So I really like sweet drinks.

198
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So I really like soju.

199
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I drink all the flavors so far, not all, most of all the flavors so far.

200
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I think I like peach a lot, peach and the strawberry, the mango one's pretty good.

201
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I like yogurt as well, it's good.

202
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And green, is it green crepe?

203
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Green crepe?

204
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Yeah, an example.

205
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

206
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah, crepe soju is really good too.

207
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I think soju has 12% so I think that's pretty a lot.

208
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I don't think that's a little bit.

209
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's either 6% to 12% so I think that's a little bit.

210
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I also, for regular drinks, I guess my two favorite drinks would be amaretto sour.

211
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And what's the other one sour?

212
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Amaretto sour and jet.

213
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
There's another one.

214
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Something, something, other sour?

215
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
No, not lemon sour.

216
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Amaretto sour and it kind of looks and tastes like ginger ale.

217
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Samurai sour is green and the other one is like, looks like ginger ale.

218
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I don't know, what?

219
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I can't remember the name.

220
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
What's the name?

221
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I can't remember.

222
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
No, not whiskey sour.

223
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I really can't remember, I can't remember.

224
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Yeah, there's a berry soju, the strawberry soju.

225
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I actually really don't like beer.

226
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It smells like pee-pee.

227
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It smells like pee-pee.

228
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Oh, like beer.

229
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
My first experience with beer was that it smelled like pee-pee and tasted like mop water.

230
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You ever smelled dirty mop water?

231
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Ever just smelled it?

232
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And you can smell what you taste.

233
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You can taste what you smell, I mean.

234
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I hate beer, me and me too.

235
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah, it's a midori sour.

236
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Amaretto sour and midori sour.

237
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Midori sour is green and amaretto looks like, I mixed it up.

238
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yeah, amaretto looks like, looks like ginger ale.

239
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Oh my god, I had a brain fart.

240
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Yeah, yeah, I had it mixed up, I had it mixed up.

241
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Midori and amaretto sour.

242
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Those are the two of my favorite sweet drinks I like.

243
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Midori, midori sour and amaretto sour.

244
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I had the midori too mixed up.

245
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Midori is green and amaretto looks like ginger ale.

246
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Dirty mop water is stinky.

247
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Yeah, imagine tasting beer and it tastes like that smell.

248
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
That was the first time I ever drunk beer and it was horrible.

249
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I hated it.

250
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I was so bad.

251
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
There is some good beer out there, but because of that one experience,

252
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I tend to try to stay away from it.

253
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Do you remember the beer? No, because it was at a bar.

254
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It was at a bar, it was my first, it was in a picture.

255
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And there was like a, like sort of, sort of like a sale, I guess.

256
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So it was like really crowded and you got a picture for like, I think a dollar or something.

257
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I gave you dirt beer.

258
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I was a dirt beer.

259
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It was at a bar, I was a first amaretto.

260
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I had a beer.

261
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It was in a really large picture.

262
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
How about non-alcoholic beer?

263
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I don't think I ever had a non-alcoholic beer.

264
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I've had a other beer.

265
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Ah, hi everyone, hi.

266
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Hi Emmy.

267
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
What come in?

268
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Hi, hi.

269
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Welcome everyone from Emmy's stream.

270
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
How did you all enjoy her stream?

271
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Hi, hi, welcome in.

272
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I, I saw Emmy did an ASMR stream today.

273
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I, did you all enjoy the ASMR from Emmy?

274
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I watched a little bit, I enjoyed it.

275
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
How are you doing, Emmy?

276
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Hi Nana.

277
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Hi.

278
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Oh, ouch.

279
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm sweaty and stinky.

280
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I need to go shower.

281
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Well, thank you so much for the little bread.

282
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I appreciate it.

283
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Go ahead and wash up so you're not a little stinker.

284
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Nice and clean.

285
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
What?

286
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
So I hope the vibes meet you all well while you're all in here for now.

287
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
After such an amazing ASMR stream.

288
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Sniff, sniff, sniff.

289
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Sniff, sniff.

290
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Sniff, sniff.

291
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Sniff, sniff.

292
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Sniff, sniff.

293
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Sniff, sniff.

294
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yes, we do.

295
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:20,000
If you guys don't know, I do get 100% of merch sales, so if you guys really want to support me that way, you can indeed buy my merch and I get 100% of the merch.

296
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Thank you for bringing that up, thank you.

297
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I didn't get forgot about that yesterday.

298
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You played this game 3 years ago, it's quite the surreal experience.

299
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Oh god.

300
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm so ready.

301
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Should we stop procrastinating and start playing now?

302
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Should we stop procrastinating?

303
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Haha.

304
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
What's up?

305
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,000
You really like the design on the pant leg on your merch? Thank you, I'm glad you like it.

306
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I forgot to mention I bought a t-shirt yesterday too.

307
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
There's also a t-shirt on there.

308
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:30,000
A sweater, a sweatpants, a t-shirt, a keychain and a standee.

309
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
If you get all of them, you can be even closer to me.

310
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Hold me close to your heart, put me on your keys on your most important object when you're outside.

311
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
One of your most important objects.

312
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Haha.

313
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Are we ready? Are we ready?

314
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Are we ready when you are?

315
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Ready when you are?

316
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You should play League on stream, I love League.

317
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Maybe, maybe once in a while, like in a blue moon, I will.

318
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Maybe do a morning stream.

319
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So I have two streams in one day.

320
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
One for League and one for another game or something.

321
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I can do that.

322
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
If you really, really, really want me to.

323
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But it's not gonna be a comment, they play it on stream.

324
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah.

325
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Isn't the longest I've seen someone chatting.

326
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
That goes two hour away before.

327
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Any good anime coming out this season?

328
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I haven't actually looked at the summer season anime yet.

329
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I haven't looked at any trailers yet.

330
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I am not sure.

331
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Maybe when I see a video come out or I get a notification, we can watch it together.

332
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
If that's allowed.

333
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Cause I don't think that's allowed.

334
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I really don't mind if you guys fall asleep to my streams.

335
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I do not mind.

336
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
It's understandable.

337
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:49,000
If you find me very relaxing, snoozing and the vibes are that real for you.

338
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Then it's understandable that you'd fall asleep.

339
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
If I listen to myself, I probably fall asleep too after doing a little bit of cringing.

340
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yuck.

341
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I hear myself yuck.

342
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Ew.

343
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Don't get it started on anime.

344
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Someone mentioned Rama One Half yesterday and I didn't see it.

345
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And I ended up seeing it when I was going through comments.

346
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And I was like, someone mentioned Rama One Half!

347
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

348
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I love Rama!

349
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
My favorite voice actors in Rama One Half.

350
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Sorry, the thought just popped into my head.

351
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Remember this?

352
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I love Rama One Half.

353
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Rama is my favorite voice actor and I really love Ryuga a lot.

354
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Ryuga is one of my favorite characters.

355
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
If you ask me who my favorite character is.

356
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
In Rama.

357
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I mean, I watched the Inuyasha series.

358
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Like, come on, how can I not like Rama?

359
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Shampoo is your favorite?

360
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I like shampoo too.

361
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I love that her grandma's name is Cologne.

362
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
What a combination.

363
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Cologne and shampoo.

364
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Shampoo.

365
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
You want a bedtime story later?

366
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Maybe I can read you one after we play a scary game.

367
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Because, you know, we're playing a scary game.

368
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I don't know if we're all too scared.

369
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I might like, soothe you all up.

370
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Shampoo is best girl.

371
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Her OST is my favorite in Inuyasha.

372
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really like her OST.

373
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It's one of my favorites.

374
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Shampoo.

375
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
No way.

376
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
No way.

377
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I didn't.

378
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
No way.

379
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

380
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It was place the entire time.

381
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
It was place the entire time.

382
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

383
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
What?

384
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
That's crazy.

385
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
What?

386
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
What?

387
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
No.

388
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
No, no, no, no.

389
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
It was place the whole time.

390
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
What you're talking about?

391
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Swing pace?

392
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
What?

393
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I didn't add that.

394
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
What?

395
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
What?

396
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Well, anyway, it's time to game.

397
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Let's go game.

398
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Let's go game, yeah.

399
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
We're gaming.

400
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
We're so gaming.

401
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
We're so ready.

402
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
We're so ready to game.

403
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Are we all so ready?

404
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Yes, time.

405
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
It's so time.

406
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I'm so ready.

407
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Let me know if the game sound is really loud.

408
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
It's hella loud for me.

409
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It's all loud.

410
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Turn it up for me.

411
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
For me, for me, for me.

412
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
For me, for me.

413
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
For me.

414
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
For me.

415
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
For me.

416
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
A little loud for you guys too.

417
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Gotcha.

418
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
How's this? Is this better or no?

419
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
No, it's still even louder for me.

420
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm gonna turn it down here.

421
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Is it better?

422
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Better.

423
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Awesome.

424
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Excellent.

425
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Let's add some ambience.

426
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah.

427
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Ambience.

428
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Is my head too big?

429
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Am I too big?

430
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Am I in the way?

431
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Am I massive?

432
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Am I too small?

433
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I'll be doing Vans here.

434
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
It's on.

435
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Let me turn that off.

436
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It's too small.

437
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
No.

438
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I'm ready.

439
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I'm so ready to game.

440
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I'm so ready.

441
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I'm so excited.

442
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Oh, yeah.

443
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I'm so very excited.

444
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Cannot wait.

445
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Wow.

446
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I'm so excited.

447
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Can't wait.

448
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
My heart is already hurting.

449
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I don't like the music.

450
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I don't like it. Can I turn it down?

451
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Yeah.

452
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Okay.

453
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Okay.

454
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I'm ready.

455
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Let's do this.

456
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Oh, my God.

457
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Okay.

458
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Okay.

459
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Okay.

460
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
A place forbidden, everyone.

461
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
A place forbidden, everyone.

462
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
A place forbidden.

463
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I honestly don't really know much about the game.

464
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
This story is a help.

465
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Isn't my apartment?

466
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Then what are we doing in it?

467
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
If it's in your apartment?

468
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I definitely didn't fall asleep in this chair.

469
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Okay.

470
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
It's kind of spooky.

471
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Uh...

472
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
What's that?

473
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
What is this?

474
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
A book for ants?

475
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Is there a way to run?

476
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Do you only walk slow?

477
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Yeah.

478
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Pretty depressing.

479
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Um...

480
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Oh, I...

481
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I...

482
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Okay. We're fine.

483
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I was...

484
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I was...

485
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I was...

486
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I was...

487
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I was...

488
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I was...

489
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I was...

490
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I was...

491
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I was...

492
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I was...

493
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I was scared.

494
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I was scared.

495
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Okay.

496
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I can do this.

497
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I'm the one that wanted to do this.

498
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I...

499
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I'm fine. Everything's fine.

500
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Everything's fine.

501
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Okay.

502
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Visitors.

503
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Intel Kremlin.

504
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Crewman.

505
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
April 9th, 1886.

506
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Mason Thompson, January 5th, 1881.

507
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Leonel.

508
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
House.

509
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
In 1900.

510
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Ella.

511
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Nams.

512
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000

513
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Samuel D.

514
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Samuel D. Jackson.

515
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Hounds.

516
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Groin.

517
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Bernard White.

518
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Greetings for your visitor.

There are more than welcome to sign your name and a date of your visit in this class book.

520
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Once you've done that,

521
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
we welcome you to explore the library to your heart's content

522
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
as long as it isn't after closing.

523
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Once you've had your fill,

524
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
please let yourself out.

525
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
We'll find a key to the front door

526
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
on one of the desks in the study.

527
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Oh, God.

528
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Oh.

529
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Okay.

530
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Okay, we're fine.

531
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
What's in here?

532
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Okay, it doesn't look like it's plugged in.

533
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Unresponsive.

534
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
The mouse on the floor.

535
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Oh.

536
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Oh.

537
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Oh.

538
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Oh.

539
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Oh.

540
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Oh.

541
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Oh.

542
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Dad.

543
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Oh.

544
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Come on, baby.

545
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
My other notes are scaring me.

546
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Okay.

547
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
What?

548
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
The book just moved?

549
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
All right.

550
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I'm scared.

551
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Greetings, visitor.

552
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
We'd like to take a moment to tell you about

553
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
our car extender,

554
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
car extender,

555
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
warranty.

556
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Our wonderful library.

557
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
A library of

558
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
books as a state

559
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
of the art facility.

560
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
The signs

561
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
replicate the rural charm found

562
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
in many older

563
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
buildings without associated risks.

564
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Such buildings are

565
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
known and accumulate.

566
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
The building might

567
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
seem like a strange sight

568
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
among wall streets.

569
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Many towering skyscrapers.

570
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
But we believe

571
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
this dichotomy

572
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
will be

573
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
what sets us apart.

574
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
We're glad you've decided

575
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
to give us a chance

576
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
and hope that our stock

577
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
of books will appeal to you.

578
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Obviously,

579
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
our collection of information isn't so vast

580
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
as to encapsulate

581
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
the whole of the internet.

582
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
But we hope

583
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
that the charming aesthetic

584
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
design of our library

585
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
will help

586
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
you escape

587
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
from the hustle and bustle

588
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
of New York life.

589
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
If you hear

590
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
any strange footsteps,

591
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
don't worry.

592
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
There may still be construction going on above

593
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
or below you.

594
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
From us all.

595
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Thanks again.

596
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Footsteps?

597
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Footsteps?

598
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Footsteps.

599
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Okay.

600
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Oh boy.

601
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
This is fine.

602
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Is this a different one?

603
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000

604
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000

608
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I can read all the transcripts.

609
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It is a nice line.

610
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
It would be great.

611
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000

00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000

a long list of books and dates were checked out funny none of them have the year listed

651
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,240
only months and days

652
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,600
talk about a blast from the past all of the photo numbers

653
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:19,600
are three digits sure

654
01:02:43,600 --> 01:03:07,080
You can crouch, why would you need to crouch, why would you need to crouch, why would you

655
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:17,760
need to crouch, why would you need to crouch, why would you need to crouch, why would you

656
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:41,760
I need to find the right key.

657
01:03:41,760 --> 01:04:05,760
I need to find the right key.

658
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:33,760
I need to find the right key.

659
01:04:33,760 --> 01:05:01,760
I need to find the right key.

660
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:27,760
I need to find the right key.

661
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:40,760
We know you've traveled far to arrive here, so please do rest, keep an open mind, read your heart's content, and we'll be sure you're well provided for.

662
01:05:40,760 --> 01:06:03,760
One matter note, we ask you not to linger after closing, or to descend too far into the library's vows. Some of our books are quite old and very sensitive to the increase of foreign temperatures and washers.

663
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:10,760
Thank you for understanding.

664
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:20,760
Weird, almost all of the words will cross out, and the pages are stuck together. I can't open this any further.

665
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:44,760
A boros, a circular symbol, a snake swallowing its tail, a representation of the endless cycle of death and rebirth,

666
01:06:44,760 --> 01:07:03,760
of wholeness, the infinite, and certain kind of no, this is, this is, this is one of those games. This is one of those games where it's like infinite, infinite rooms, where you go in a circle.

667
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:14,760
Oh no, what have I got myself into? Oh no, this is one of those games.

668
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:23,760
Oh, don't go. Oh, oh, don't go.

669
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:50,760
Oh, and the certain kind of kawaii meaninglessness never puts much stock and mysticism, but in this place it's past pasted all over the goddamn walls.

670
01:07:50,760 --> 01:08:06,760
Though to avoid that, last I remember, I was on some occult's website, sitting on the farthest end of the internet, past the places that normally dissuade the less curious.

671
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:30,760
I had just a little too much time in my hands, I remember falling asleep. Now I'm here. No recording said that this place is the library of a borough. Or ro boros. Remember reading something about that, but not what or where.

672
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:58,760
If you're reading this, keep an eye out. Something isn't right. That's the last person who signed the library. It was V.

673
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:04,760
Oh, it's the flies. I got scared for a second.

674
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:27,760
Rest the brass. Rest the brass for the key. Rest the brass. Thanks for visiting Arba. Thanks for visiting. Thanks for visiting. Thanks for coming. You can go now.

675
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,760
Can I just go? Can I just leave?

676
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:55,760
How did the mug get all the hair? Wasn't it on the desk?

677
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:14,760
Is it okay to leave? I'm just gonna go.

678
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:27,760
This can't be right. Oh god. Oh god.

679
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:46,760
The game. The game. The game it crashed.

680
01:10:46,760 --> 01:11:11,760
It crashed. I hear it's back or back.

681
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:29,760
Hello. We'd like to inform you that the library is now closed. Note that it is unlawful to remain on the premises after closing. This is your one and only warning.

682
01:11:46,760 --> 01:12:15,760
I'm so terrified right now. I'm so sorry.

683
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:31,960
I'm so scared.

684
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:32,960
I'm so scared.

685
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,720
I don't know why I'm cleaning.

686
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,760
Am I stress cleaning right now?

687
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,760
Am I stress cleaning?

688
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,760
Am I stress cleaning?

689
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,760
Oh, man.

690
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:02,760
Oh, man.

691
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,760
Oh, this is so scary.

692
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:16,760
So, Mr. Storm, Act 3, Scene 2, Bernice enters while closely by the librarian...

693
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:20,760
I'm, like, stuttering and everything.

694
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,760
Oh, my gosh.

695
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:28,760
The librarian, Bernice's breathless, looking both exasperated and slightly excited.

696
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:33,760
The librarian's expression is unreadable.

697
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:39,760
As per usual, Bernice, but my husband will find out about us.

698
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:40,760
Wow.

699
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:43,760
He won't stay out forever.

700
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:51,760
Librarian, I wouldn't be so sure, my dear, but shall we retire to the living room

701
01:13:51,760 --> 01:14:00,760
if we're to speak of such unpleasantness as your husband?

702
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,760
Yee.

703
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,760
Bernice's face breaks suddenly into a grin.

704
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:17,760
She grabs the librarian's hand, taking him onto the couch beside her.

705
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,760
Bernice, I'm fine.

706
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:29,760
Then if you are to stay, I want to hear some of those secrets you keep talking about.

707
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:35,760
You can't play with me for the fool forever.

708
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:41,760
Librarian, I would never claim to do such a thing, my dear.

709
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:49,760
Would you care to hear how I can stop a human heart with but a word?

710
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,760
Oh.

711
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,760
Oh, Bernice.

712
01:14:54,760 --> 01:15:00,760
Goodness, that sounds dangerous.

713
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:06,760
Librarian, it most certainly is.

714
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,760
I wish to hear it.

715
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,760
Then, of course, you shall.

716
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:19,760
He leans close to Bernice, closes her eyes as if expecting a kiss.

717
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:25,760
The librarian leans past her, whispering something into her ear.

718
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,760
Bernice's eyes open wide.

719
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:39,760
She gives a single jerk, a strangled groan, and goes limp, sliding off the couch.

720
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,760
Eh? Eh?

721
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:47,760
Too curious for her own good.

722
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:57,760
What? What he do? What he do? What he say?

723
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:09,760
He stands, reaching in one of his pockets to withdraw a single black case containing Bernice's wedding ring.

724
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:19,760
Taking a cur-cur-cur-curusary?

725
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,760
Curious? Curusary?

726
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,760
Cursory? Cursory look around the living room.

727
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,760
I've never seen that word before.

728
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:38,760
The librarian eventually focuses on a single point on the opposite side.

729
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:59,760
The librarian crosses the floor, leaves his item, and turns to leave as he does so the scene darkens,

730
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,760
leaving only a single spotlight to eliminate the stage.

731
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:12,760
It is fixed on the small black case, which the librarian has decided to leave, sitting on top of the minister's writing desk.

732
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:17,760
What happened? What he do to her?

733
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,760
He murdered her? Is she dead?

734
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,760
Is she dead?

735
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:28,760
Very early into my profession.

736
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:38,760
Professorship? Professorship? Is that a word?

737
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:42,760
Professorship?

738
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:53,760
A student came to my office one spring afternoon with a stack of papers in her arms.

739
01:17:53,760 --> 01:18:01,760
She said, she'd be having strange dreams of a place stretching forward and backwards into infinity,

740
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:14,760
dreams of hallways splitting to hallways, dreams of being lost in the incarnate cuts of some gigantic place that could not possibly exist.

741
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,760
On the papers were crude scratches.

742
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:36,760
She was no artist, she said, but something about the dreams had left some vivid impression on her that putting what was in her brain on the page seemed her only option.

743
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:39,760
She was clearly distressed.

744
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:50,760
When I was gently suggested, when I gently just suggested that she visited the university psychologist rather than the resident,

745
01:18:50,760 --> 01:19:01,760
ancient history professor, she violently shook her head asking if I knew anything about something called an oral boroughs library,

746
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,760
or perhaps a library of oral boroughs.

747
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,760
It wasn't entirely clear.

748
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:22,760
I told her the common knowledge about the symbol taken from the Egyptians by the Greeks and from the Greeks by the Middle Europeans,

749
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:29,760
a sign in alchemy of death and rebirth and so forth.

750
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:38,760
The students continued shaking her head all through my explanation until she suddenly cut me off.

751
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:46,760
Oh, this one's long.

752
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:52,760
Those are too old, she said.

753
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:56,760
The place from my dreams was modern.

754
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:08,760
It was electricity, computers, but everything seemed ancient and stink of old dust, damped wood and something else.

755
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:16,760
Please, don't you know of anything in recent times that might have stemmed from that idea?

756
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:25,760
I confessed, but I hadn't, especially considering the size and the many niches of the modern world.

757
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:32,760
She left without another word. They were her drawings by and something about the conversation shook me.

758
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:46,760
I looked through the crude drawings made in a shaky hand and saw in the familiar shapes design an odd air of ominousness.

759
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:57,760
Ominousness.

760
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:13,760
I'm a little bit dyslexic, so I hope you guys can understand.

761
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:32,760
Oh my god.

762
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:47,760
English is so hard.

763
01:21:47,760 --> 01:22:04,760
It's like ominousness, like looking at the facade of a dark building and hearing the slightest stretching and things that shouldn't be just behind the stones.

764
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:26,760
All very juvenile thoughts, and yet when I went home that evening, I brought the drawings. I can help but want to look more into what we discuss into that library of arboreals.

765
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:45,760
It was largely fruitless. I found many sites and articles on alchemy, the symbol itself, or the public library in Obros, county, which was located somewhere in the rural Wisconsin.

766
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:58,760
But just as the hour crept past midnight, I found something, the slight snatch of information at the bottom of a rabbit hole series of links.

767
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:08,760
I will not repeat the website's domain or my steps to arrive there for fear that someone might try to replicate what I did.

768
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:27,760
But I will repeat what I found, because just as that student couldn't get the ideas from her head without drawing, I find I can't think of anything else, waking or sleeping.

769
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:42,760
I hope those will help. The library of arboreals, a kind of waking nightmare, arrived upon by those too curious for their own good.

770
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:58,760
Rich in the black secrets, rich in the dark ideas lost to time, rich in languages from dead races on other planets.

771
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:19,760
The fortunate die. The truly lucky, or perhaps the most unfortunate of all, become tenders for all time, knowing far more than any living being could ever hope to learn without becoming a permanent,

772
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:26,760
prematurely screaming stain on the face of space's time forever.

773
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:37,760
This is so scary. Why is reading this even more scary than actually playing the game?

774
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:45,760
Though we are actually playing the game. There's a lot of reading, and I don't mind it.

775
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:53,760
It helps me distract myself from the game itself.

776
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:02,760
None have left. It's unscathed.

777
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:20,760
There are forbidden tunes on that will that would prevent you from breathing, so to merely touch them, and the tenders are beyond sanity and jealously kept their terrible secrets.

778
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:26,760
We've searched enough, and this is your final warning.

779
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:41,760
That night I slept fitfully, my dreams beset by images of dark, dusty plays eerie for its supposed normalcy.

780
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:49,760
I could almost feel things passing by, just beneath the floorboards within the walls, watching me.

781
01:25:50,760 --> 01:26:03,760
Every exit led to another room, nearly the same as the one before it, and out the window I saw only black.

782
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:17,760
My dreams have been consistently disturbed since that night, so much so that it is hard for me to teach, so heavily preoccupied is my waking mind.

783
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:27,760
Waking mind, I hope this writing will be enough for my mind to use one last thing.

784
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:34,760
I've since tried to find the student who first contacted me to tell her what I learned.

785
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:42,760
My hope was that I might be able to put her mind at ease, or at least commiserate with her.

786
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,760
But I haven't been able to find her.

787
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:53,760
In fact, since the day she visited my office, her roommates haven't seen her, nor has anyone else.

788
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:56,760
And I fear I might be next.

789
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,760
I'm so scared to turn around.

790
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,760
It's so scary to turn around.

791
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:22,760
The note is largely obscured by blood. You can make out only a handful of words.

792
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:34,760
And one of the dustier books fell apart in my hands. There were these arcane scribbles, feels. I've tried to read away, but it's still not quite right.

793
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,760
Like something watching.

794
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:59,760
The vent bolted in pretty tight. I don't see myself tearing this out with bare hands anytime soon.

795
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:10,760
What's that? More garbage? More trash?

796
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:18,760
I don't know, I feel this urge to clean, like it will make everything better.

797
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:23,760
I gotta be less scared if I just clean.

798
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:32,760
It's locked.

799
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,760
Oh no, I missed the garbage can.

800
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,760
Can I not pick that up?

801
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:05,760
What the fuck is?

802
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:10,760
What is that?

803
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:12,760
What is that?

804
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:15,760
Am I okay?

805
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:17,760
Am I okay?

806
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,760
Is this a screwdriver?

807
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:02,760
If I like get cookies, if I like clean up the library?

808
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:13,560
It's gone! It's gone, it's gone.

809
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:22,760
No, no no, no.

810
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:39,520
No. No. No. No. No, no. No. No. No, no, no. No. No. No. Carine. No. No. No. It's just

811
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:50,420
shy. Oh no, no, no. A kind slumber. I've been driving for miles and miles and miles

812
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:55,380
at night I'm scared so tired been on the road for what feels like days don't

815
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:14,620

Jalopy it's a Jalopy and a truck that looks a lot like my Jalopy Jalopy Jalopy

liners just as cold to stay outside door oh outdoors and hardly more inviting

835
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:21,260
the distressed red leather of a bunch of boots and that should have been trust

836
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:29,860
years ago dirty tables floors buffed into a mockery of cleanliness empty but for a

837
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:35,540
man in a heavy coat in one corner in a waitress the other the man is standing

838
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:41,900
the waitress is also standing they look like prize fighters about to square off

839
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:51,060
or wood if they were looking at each other instead I can't see the man's face

840
01:34:51,060 --> 01:35:05,740
first collar and hat and the woman is looking at me no thank you please look

841
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:30,420
away

842
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:48,140
seat sir my heart is like my heart is going right now and all we've been doing is

843
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:55,940
reading I swear that while reading everything feels so more and much more

844
01:35:55,940 --> 01:36:04,820
intense so very very very very intense

845
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:25,740
seat sir I nod rough weather out she says trying to smile as I take my seat I

846
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:52,300
can tell it looks terrible do you know a place where I can get some shut up

847
01:36:55,740 --> 01:37:16,460
I asked almost without realizing it I can't sleep but maybe I can still try not

848
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:22,380
a motel for miles you can sleep at your table if you want though you don't even

849
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:32,100
have to order anything thank you I sit my head down table my eyes don't shut that

850
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:38,580
black knowledge slithered it's away from those stained pages and into my brain

851
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:46,780
and now it grips my eyelids forcing them wide the diner sideways I'm like this

852
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:55,620
for a few minutes then there is someone else standing sideways in front of me that man

853
01:37:55,620 --> 01:38:10,580
in that coat his face is a dark red mass sleep deprivation tired buddy I nod the

854

You're not you when you're hungry.

940
02:05:12,380 --> 02:05:27,380
Well apparently my doctor told me that caffeine is really good for putting people with ADHD to sleep

941
02:05:27,380 --> 02:05:36,380
and helping them like focus for like a small bit but usually instead of a crash you get tired

942
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:47,380
and this is more common with people with ADHD so I was recommended to drink a lot of caffeine

943
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:54,980
so I have well I have I have red bull I have some caffeine tea or is it yeah I've

944
02:05:54,980 --> 02:06:12,980
caffeinated tea and coffee have a lot of caffeine stuff

945
02:06:42,980 --> 02:06:55,980
blueberry red bull the heck is that that sounds horrible

946
02:06:55,980 --> 02:07:16,980
it goes hard down now I have to try it down it only took one person to say it tastes good

947
02:07:16,980 --> 02:07:24,980
I thought everyone was gonna be like yeah yeah don't drink that now I have to try it

948
02:07:46,980 --> 02:08:05,980
the snuggers is so sticky oh it's so sticky

949
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:32,980
I just like sticking to the top of my mouth

950
02:08:32,980 --> 02:08:57,980
yeah

951
02:08:57,980 --> 02:09:07,980
I'm a snickers almond snickers I like them all my favorite ones

952
02:09:27,980 --> 02:09:49,980
hmm

953
02:09:50,980 --> 02:09:52,980
the heck

954
02:09:56,980 --> 02:10:06,980
me too I like almond don't this kind not actually a big fan of chocolate though

955
02:10:06,980 --> 02:10:12,980
like don't get me wrong I like chocolate my favorite kind of chocolate is milk chocolate

956
02:10:12,980 --> 02:10:19,980
but I don't like dark chocolate at all I really don't like bitter things

957
02:10:19,980 --> 02:10:48,980
I'm a quietist I hear dark chocolate is healthy for healthier for your skin

958
02:10:48,980 --> 02:11:01,980
though I tried it to eat dark chocolate there's only so many brands I can eat

959
02:11:01,980 --> 02:11:13,980
and too much chocolate on my some of my foods is a bit much my favorite flavors

960
02:11:13,980 --> 02:11:20,980
are strawberry and vanilla so if especially if it's ice cream related strawberry and vanilla

961
02:11:20,980 --> 02:11:28,980
I do like chocolate ice cream I do sometimes I hate it but I wouldn't it wouldn't be my go-to

962
02:11:28,980 --> 02:11:46,980
cacao yeah I like cacao I like white chocolate too it's good

963
02:11:58,980 --> 02:12:11,980
should we should we keep trying to play the game I do you think it will crash again

964
02:12:28,980 --> 02:12:32,980
yeah the story was getting good no

965
02:12:37,980 --> 02:12:39,980
one more go

966
02:12:49,980 --> 02:12:51,980
sounds risky

967
02:12:51,980 --> 02:12:58,980
could be I really don't know what the true cause is but we're gonna do some checks after after

968
02:12:59,980 --> 02:13:01,980
everything's fine

969
02:13:05,980 --> 02:13:08,980
we'll do better checking after

970
02:13:23,980 --> 02:13:25,980
we stay smacking

971
02:13:29,980 --> 02:13:31,980
you just want to hear me

972
02:13:42,980 --> 02:13:44,980
very risky

973
02:13:45,980 --> 02:13:47,980
hmm

974
02:13:51,980 --> 02:14:00,980
could always read some books true true you're not wrong I like that idea

975
02:14:14,980 --> 02:14:18,980
how was the game it was it was actually getting pretty good the story was getting

976
02:14:18,980 --> 02:14:22,980
really good it was getting really scary and intense

977
02:14:26,980 --> 02:14:28,980
it's getting pretty a ton

978
02:14:35,980 --> 02:14:38,980
maybe we can continue it another day

979
02:14:39,980 --> 02:14:47,980
how do you guys like that again after figuring out what what went wrong we can't try playing it

980
02:14:47,980 --> 02:14:49,980

981
02:14:49,980 --> 02:15:12,980

yeah it was getting pretty intense

985
02:15:30,980 --> 02:15:37,980
fun fact goats were one of the first animals to be tamed by animals and were being hurt in

986
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:46,980
9,000 years ago yeah but was it not longer was it only 9,000 years ago

1034
02:23:20,980 --> 02:23:26,980

1071
02:28:46,980 --> 02:28:51,980
I'm going to pronounce words wrong I'm going to say things wrong

1072
02:28:51,980 --> 02:29:00,980
I'm going to see I'm going to read things wrong and then I'll do it again and I'll do it again

I don't mind you guys correcting me but we're gonna have to understand that even if you

1076
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:59,800
correct me the chances of me saying it wrong again are 99.99% high 99.99% high

1077
02:29:59,800 --> 02:30:04,520

1082
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:29,720
tummy ever hurts to the point where you get the twisties like us like it feels

1083
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:35,200
like something's pinching your stomach and then twisting grabbing quite a big

1084
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:45,480
bunch and twisting not like small pinch but like a you grab a lot of skin you

1085
02:31:45,480 --> 02:31:55,480
know you grab a lot of it and then you twist it that's that's what I feel when

1086
02:31:55,480 --> 02:31:58,240
I get the tummy eggs

1087
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:20,040

02:32:20,040 --> 02:32:29,200

I pinky promise hmm

1094
02:33:27,300 --> 02:33:33,300
Remember your pinky promise?

1095
02:33:33,300 --> 02:33:37,300
It's a food sooner than that.

1096
02:33:37,300 --> 02:33:40,300
I can eat some bread.

1097
02:33:40,300 --> 02:33:42,300
I like bread.

1098
02:33:42,300 --> 02:33:45,300
I eat some bread.

1099
02:33:45,300 --> 02:33:55,300
I like bread.

1100
02:33:55,300 --> 02:34:05,300
I like bread.

1101
02:34:05,300 --> 02:34:10,300
I like bread.

1102
02:34:10,300 --> 02:34:18,300
You put the apple on it.

1103
02:34:18,300 --> 02:34:26,300
95% pinky.

1104
02:34:26,300 --> 02:34:29,300
Don't make the promise.

1105
02:34:29,300 --> 02:34:33,300
Pull pink.

1106
02:34:33,300 --> 02:34:40,300
Pinkie, pinkie, pinkie, pinkie, pinkie, from love.

1107
02:34:40,300 --> 02:34:49,300
I'm very rubbing my own tummy.

1108
02:34:49,300 --> 02:34:57,300
I don't like tummy.

1109
02:34:57,300 --> 02:35:01,300
It doesn't really help.

1110
02:35:01,300 --> 02:35:05,300
Not all the time.

1111
02:35:05,300 --> 02:35:09,300
Cookies, chocolate, bread bowl.

1112
02:35:09,300 --> 02:35:14,300
That's what I'm going to eat today.

1113
02:35:14,300 --> 02:35:17,300
It's the best meal.

1114
02:35:17,300 --> 02:35:20,300
The only meal I eat today.

1115
02:35:20,300 --> 02:35:22,300
Cookies, chocolate, and bread bowl.

1116
02:35:22,300 --> 02:35:27,300
I'm going to eat some bread.

1117
02:35:27,300 --> 02:35:47,300
My finger.

1118
02:35:47,300 --> 02:36:02,300
I have a lot of bread bowl and water.

1119
02:36:02,300 --> 02:36:14,300
I have to drink water because my kidney has been having issues lately.

1120
02:36:14,300 --> 02:36:18,300
I have tons of water.

1121
02:36:18,300 --> 02:36:24,300
What's 24?

1122
02:36:24,300 --> 02:36:26,300
24.

1123
02:36:26,300 --> 02:36:28,300
I'm doing math.

1124
02:36:28,300 --> 02:36:30,300
48.

1125
02:36:30,300 --> 02:36:34,300
48 water is sitting right here next to me.

1126
02:36:34,300 --> 02:36:39,300
I drunk all 24 in the span of a week.

1127
02:36:39,300 --> 02:36:42,300
I have a ton of water next to me.

1128
02:36:42,300 --> 02:36:56,300
Water is very important in my diet.

1129
02:36:56,300 --> 02:36:58,300
Basically a four course meal.

1130
02:36:58,300 --> 02:37:01,300
It's true.

1131
02:37:01,300 --> 02:37:10,300
Alright, mama's okay.

1132
02:37:10,300 --> 02:37:18,300
I'm going to put anything between the bread to make a sandwich.

1133
02:37:18,300 --> 02:37:24,300
I have male nails.

1134
02:37:24,300 --> 02:37:29,300
I can't have male nails that make my stomach hurt.

1135
02:37:29,300 --> 02:37:39,300
It makes me go bleh at the same time.

1136
02:37:39,300 --> 02:37:43,300
I can't eat male nails.

1137
02:37:43,300 --> 02:37:51,300
Have you ever been like, this is a poor person's story.

1138
02:37:51,300 --> 02:37:56,300
I've ever been so broke.

1139
02:37:56,300 --> 02:38:02,300
What was your brokeest food you ever ate?

1140
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:05,300
Mine was bread and mayo.

1141
02:38:05,300 --> 02:38:26,300
I would take mayo, put it on a slice of bread and eat that.

1142
02:38:26,300 --> 02:38:31,300
Sleep. Relatable.

1143
02:38:31,300 --> 02:38:39,300
So relatable.

1144
02:38:39,300 --> 02:38:55,300
I'm so funny.

1145
02:38:55,300 --> 02:38:57,300
You see bread mayo because you liked it.

1146
02:38:57,300 --> 02:39:00,300
I ended up liking it afterwards.

1147
02:39:00,300 --> 02:39:04,300
But it was definitely just broke person food at the time.

1148
02:39:04,300 --> 02:39:11,300
It was literally all I could eat.

1149
02:39:11,300 --> 02:39:14,300
Where I used to live, we had mice.

1150
02:39:14,300 --> 02:39:20,300
So a lot of our food wasn't really good to eat.

1151
02:39:20,300 --> 02:39:23,300
We had the big ol' micey micey.

1152
02:39:23,300 --> 02:39:26,300
Small, really small, tiny micey micey.

1153
02:39:26,300 --> 02:39:28,300
Air.

1154
02:39:28,300 --> 02:39:30,300
Jam sandwich.

1155
02:39:30,300 --> 02:39:33,300
Spam in the dollar store.

1156
02:39:33,300 --> 02:39:47,300
A squid of mustard to get some kick.

1157
02:39:47,300 --> 02:39:50,300
Gold Caesar salad, isn't that dangerous?

1158
02:39:50,300 --> 02:39:55,300
I heard people got really ill from eating old salad.

1159
02:39:55,300 --> 02:39:57,300
Sounds dangerous.

1160
02:39:57,300 --> 02:39:59,300
Careful.

1161
02:39:59,300 --> 02:40:07,300
I read in sauce and stories, some crazy stories about the most innocent food murdering people.

1162
02:40:07,300 --> 02:40:11,300
Potatoes.

1163
02:40:11,300 --> 02:40:15,300
You guys heard about the potatoes?

1164
02:40:15,300 --> 02:40:24,300
This is getting dark fast.

1165
02:40:24,300 --> 02:40:26,300
I actually can't eat ramen.

1166
02:40:26,300 --> 02:40:28,300
Packaged ramen.

1167
02:40:28,300 --> 02:40:33,300
My stomach can't digest the noodles for some reason.

1168
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:35,300
Processed noodles.

1169
02:40:35,300 --> 02:40:42,300
Whatever they're putting in the noodles and packaged ramen, my stomach can't digest it.

1170
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:53,300
So like 5 to 10 minutes after eating it, it comes back up really fast.

1171
02:40:53,300 --> 02:40:58,300
It comes all back up right away.

1172
02:40:58,300 --> 02:41:02,300
I can have ramen, unfortunately, unless it's freshly made.

1173
02:41:02,300 --> 02:41:06,300
Freshly made ramen.

1174
02:41:06,300 --> 02:41:08,300
Very very fresh.

1175
02:41:08,300 --> 02:41:11,300
I have a favorite ramen spot that I go to.

1176
02:41:11,300 --> 02:41:13,300
I can't go often because it's really far away from me.

1177
02:41:13,300 --> 02:41:17,300
And I can't really travel far because of my health.

1178
02:41:17,300 --> 02:41:20,300
So if I'm feeling really good, I go there.

1179
02:41:20,300 --> 02:41:24,300
It's my favorite place.

1180
02:41:24,300 --> 02:41:27,300
And I'll eat there because it's homemade.

1181
02:41:27,300 --> 02:41:29,300
Scratch. Ramen made out of scratch.

1182
02:41:29,300 --> 02:41:30,300
From scratch.

1183
02:41:30,300 --> 02:41:32,300
And it's really really good.

1184
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:43,300
When you're so broke, you look for things to smell to fill you up.

1185
02:41:43,300 --> 02:41:46,300
Bro!

1186
02:41:46,300 --> 02:41:48,300
I get you.

1187
02:41:54,300 --> 02:41:56,300
Bro.

1188
02:41:56,300 --> 02:41:59,300
I understand.

1189
02:41:59,300 --> 02:42:02,300
Bro, I understand it, but I understand you.

1190
02:42:09,300 --> 02:42:11,300
Bro, I get you.

1191
02:42:16,300 --> 02:42:20,300
Water in Cheerios is crazy!

1192
02:42:20,300 --> 02:42:22,300
No!

1193
02:42:22,300 --> 02:42:25,300
Water in Cheerios!

1194
02:42:26,300 --> 02:42:28,300
No!

1195
02:42:44,300 --> 02:42:46,300
Yeah, I can't travel far because of my health.

1196
02:42:46,300 --> 02:42:49,300
That is indeed what I said.

1197
02:42:49,300 --> 02:42:59,300
So when I feel really really good and I take all my meds and I'm feeling really great,

1198
02:42:59,300 --> 02:43:01,300
and I can go far, I do.

1199
02:43:01,300 --> 02:43:03,300
And I go even further.

1200
02:43:03,300 --> 02:43:05,300
Even further than that.

1201
02:43:05,300 --> 02:43:08,300
But I get really tired really fast.

1202
02:43:08,300 --> 02:43:13,300
And because the medication I'm on makes me sleepy,

1203
02:43:13,300 --> 02:43:22,300
I end up falling asleep in public on public transportation and stuff.

1204
02:43:22,300 --> 02:43:24,300
So I go.

1205
02:43:31,300 --> 02:43:35,300
I get really really really exhausted easy and then my back starts hurting,

1206
02:43:35,300 --> 02:43:37,300
my legs and my arms.

1207
02:43:37,300 --> 02:43:39,300
And I'm like, I gotta sit down.

1208
02:43:39,300 --> 02:43:40,300
I have to sit down.

1209
02:43:40,300 --> 02:43:43,300
I can't walk anymore.

1210
02:43:44,300 --> 02:43:47,300
I have to sit down.

1211
02:43:47,300 --> 02:43:50,300
So I end up like sitting and stuff.

1212
02:43:56,300 --> 02:43:58,300
I have to...

1213
02:44:07,300 --> 02:44:09,300
I have to sit down.

1214
02:44:13,300 --> 02:44:15,300
My little brothers are like,

1215
02:44:15,300 --> 02:44:19,300
ah, two guys talking about how poor they were growing up.

1216
02:44:19,300 --> 02:44:22,300
We ate the fruit off the wallpaper.

1217
02:44:22,300 --> 02:44:25,300
No way!

1218
02:44:25,300 --> 02:44:30,300
And I'm mad, I know what fruit wallpaper they're talking about.

1219
02:44:33,300 --> 02:44:35,300
How do I know that?

1220
02:44:35,300 --> 02:44:39,300
My grandma used to have the...

1221
02:44:39,300 --> 02:44:45,300
She used to put wallpaper on her cabinets.

1222
02:44:45,300 --> 02:44:50,300
Her cabinets used to have the fruit wallpaper,

1223
02:44:50,300 --> 02:44:52,300
usually on the inside, on the floor of it,

1224
02:44:52,300 --> 02:44:55,300
or like somewhere in the kitchen.

1225
02:44:55,300 --> 02:44:57,300
When grandma comes,

1226
02:44:57,300 --> 02:44:59,300
rum rum.

1227
02:45:19,300 --> 02:45:21,300
Hope I'll be less broke now.

1228
02:45:21,300 --> 02:45:23,300
Me too.

1229
02:45:23,300 --> 02:45:25,300
Me too.

1230
02:45:28,300 --> 02:45:35,300
And then I'll be able to finally give my own place.

1231
02:45:35,300 --> 02:45:39,300
I still live with my family.

1232
02:45:39,300 --> 02:45:42,300
There's quite a lot of them here.

1233
02:45:42,300 --> 02:45:45,300
This place is really small, very loud.

1234
02:45:45,300 --> 02:45:50,300
I can't really do my ASMRs for you guys properly.

1235
02:45:50,300 --> 02:45:54,300
So I hope you guys understand about the quality

1236
02:45:54,300 --> 02:45:57,300
of some of my ASMRs

1237
02:45:57,300 --> 02:46:03,300
and the quality of some of my, uh...

1238
02:46:03,300 --> 02:46:05,300
things.

1239
02:46:05,300 --> 02:46:07,300
I, uh...

1240
02:46:07,300 --> 02:46:09,300
Unfortunately...

1241
02:46:09,300 --> 02:46:11,300
I'm sorry.

1242
02:46:11,300 --> 02:46:13,300
Voice crack.

1243
02:46:13,300 --> 02:46:16,300
Unfortunately, be, uh...

1244
02:46:16,300 --> 02:46:21,300
careful when it comes to sounds and stuff.

1245
02:46:21,300 --> 02:46:24,300
My chat froze again.

1246
02:46:27,300 --> 02:46:31,300
And I think...

1247
02:46:33,300 --> 02:46:35,300
I think it's back?

1248
02:46:35,300 --> 02:46:37,300
Oh, it's back.

1249
02:46:52,300 --> 02:46:55,300
You'll like it your country, huh?

1250
02:46:55,300 --> 02:46:59,300
I mean, being my age

1251
02:46:59,300 --> 02:47:03,300
and still being, you know, here

1252
02:47:03,300 --> 02:47:06,300
makes me feel a little down.

1253
02:47:06,300 --> 02:47:10,300
But I understand, given, um...

1254
02:47:10,300 --> 02:47:14,300
the generation is smart

1255
02:47:14,300 --> 02:47:18,300
to stay with your parents anyways.

1256
02:47:18,300 --> 02:47:20,300
But I, I can't...

1257
02:47:20,300 --> 02:47:23,300
I cannot take it much longer.

1258
02:47:25,300 --> 02:47:28,300
Okay, I have, like, no freedom.

1259
02:47:28,300 --> 02:47:31,300
No freedom to do what you want.

1260
02:47:33,300 --> 02:47:35,300
Can't even walk around my own...

1261
02:47:35,300 --> 02:47:37,300
my, um, the house

1262
02:47:37,300 --> 02:47:39,300
or my own room.

1263
02:47:39,300 --> 02:47:43,300
Uh, Nicky, a majority of the time.

1264
02:47:43,300 --> 02:47:45,300
Can't even do that.

1265
02:47:45,300 --> 02:47:47,300
It's not fair.

1266
02:47:47,300 --> 02:47:50,300
I have to worry about people just opening my door.

1267
02:47:50,300 --> 02:47:52,300
Hello?

1268
02:47:54,300 --> 02:47:57,300
Aw, man, come on.

1269
02:47:58,300 --> 02:48:01,300
Let me be free.

1270
02:48:02,300 --> 02:48:04,300
Nicky.

1271
02:48:16,300 --> 02:48:18,300
Does the merch go directly to you

1272
02:48:18,300 --> 02:48:20,300
or to Valor, Valor?

1273
02:48:20,300 --> 02:48:22,300
Uh, directly to me.

1274
02:48:22,300 --> 02:48:25,300
I get 100% a merch.

1275
02:48:26,300 --> 02:48:30,300
Directly to me, yeah.

1276
02:48:36,300 --> 02:48:38,300
It's, uh, my heart.

1277
02:48:38,300 --> 02:48:41,300
Uh, it's doing, uh,

1278
02:48:41,300 --> 02:48:44,300
loop-de-loops right now.

1279
02:48:44,300 --> 02:48:46,300
It's almost time for me

1280
02:48:46,300 --> 02:48:49,300
to take my medication, I believe, I think.

1281
02:48:49,300 --> 02:48:52,300
I'm not really paying attention to the time.

1282
02:48:53,300 --> 02:48:57,300
I was supposed to be reading you guys a story,

1283
02:48:57,300 --> 02:49:02,300
but I'm just fiving here with you guys.

1284
02:49:07,300 --> 02:49:09,300
You sure it's not the Red Bull?

1285
02:49:09,300 --> 02:49:11,300
I haven't drunk any yet.

1286
02:49:11,300 --> 02:49:13,300
I only mentioned that I have Red Bull,

1287
02:49:13,300 --> 02:49:16,300
but I haven't drunk any yet.

1288
02:49:16,300 --> 02:49:18,300
I have Red Bull yet.

1289
02:49:18,300 --> 02:49:20,300
Not yet.

1290
02:49:20,300 --> 02:49:23,300
I'm just thinking about it, but not yet.

1291
02:49:28,300 --> 02:49:30,300
Please don't go.

1292
02:49:30,300 --> 02:49:32,300
I'm not going anywhere yet.

1293
02:49:35,300 --> 02:49:37,300
Not yet, not yet.

1294
02:49:37,300 --> 02:49:39,300
A lot of yet-yets.

1295
02:49:39,300 --> 02:49:41,300
Not yet.

1296
02:49:42,300 --> 02:49:45,300
I'll be around for a while.

1297
02:49:51,300 --> 02:49:53,300
You're enjoying the chit chat?

1298
02:49:53,300 --> 02:49:55,300
You already got your hoodie?

1299
02:49:55,300 --> 02:49:57,300
Well, thank you.

1300
02:49:57,300 --> 02:50:00,300
I'm glad you could say, where's the hoodie?

1301
02:50:02,300 --> 02:50:06,300
Eventually, you'll even get the sweatpants, too, to match.

1302
02:50:21,300 --> 02:50:25,300
You was trying to tip on stream elements,

1303
02:50:25,300 --> 02:50:27,300
and I won't let you.

1304
02:50:27,300 --> 02:50:30,300
I am not really sure

1305
02:50:30,300 --> 02:50:33,300
what their issue there is.

1306
02:50:45,300 --> 02:50:47,300
Hmm.

1307
02:50:50,300 --> 02:50:52,300
Hmm.

1308
02:50:52,300 --> 02:50:54,300
Hmm.

1309
02:50:54,300 --> 02:50:56,300
Hmm.

1310
02:51:18,300 --> 02:51:20,300
Can you have a pat?

1311
02:51:20,300 --> 02:51:22,300
Sure you can.

1312
02:51:22,300 --> 02:51:24,300
Good boy.

1313
02:51:24,300 --> 02:51:26,300
Good girl.

1314
02:51:27,300 --> 02:51:29,300
Here you go.

1315
02:51:31,300 --> 02:51:33,300
Wanna have a pat too?

1316
02:51:33,300 --> 02:51:35,300
Wanna hug, too?

1317
02:51:35,300 --> 02:51:37,300
I'll give you a hug.

1318
02:51:40,300 --> 02:51:42,300
Hmm.

1319
02:51:42,300 --> 02:51:44,300
You like that?

1320
02:51:44,300 --> 02:51:46,300
Hmm. Here you go.

1321
02:51:46,300 --> 02:51:48,300
Nice hug.

1322
02:51:48,300 --> 02:51:52,300
There you go. Nice hug.

1323
02:52:06,300 --> 02:52:12,300
Trani said, uh, was saying that some girls had paper restricted because it was coming in so fast.

1324
02:52:12,300 --> 02:52:16,300
Most likely, yes, I think that's what I remember as well.

1325
02:52:16,300 --> 02:52:20,300
That's probably the case.

1326
02:52:24,300 --> 02:52:28,300
Chad is greedy. No, Chad is a cutie.

1327
02:52:28,300 --> 02:52:32,300
That's what mommy is here for.

1328
02:52:32,300 --> 02:52:36,300
Chad wants hugs. Chad wants cuddles.

1329
02:52:36,300 --> 02:52:40,300
Chad wants kisses.

1330
02:52:40,300 --> 02:52:44,300
I don't want to get hit by YouTube.

1331
02:52:58,300 --> 02:53:02,300
It's gonna be a thing, isn't it? Just hashtag no pants gang.

1332
02:53:02,300 --> 02:53:06,300
True. I'm not wearing pants either.

1333
02:53:10,300 --> 02:53:14,300
Who wears pants? Who needs pants?

1334
02:53:14,300 --> 02:53:18,300
Surely not me.

1335
02:53:40,300 --> 02:53:44,300
There's someone who doesn't like it when they don't wear pants.

1336
02:53:44,300 --> 02:53:48,300
You're so lucky.

1337
02:53:48,300 --> 02:53:52,300
I was just out of space with my own.

1338
02:53:52,300 --> 02:53:56,300
No pants, no nothing.

1339
02:53:56,300 --> 02:54:00,300
With an AC.

1340
02:54:00,300 --> 02:54:04,300
I get it though.

1341
02:54:12,300 --> 02:54:16,300
Pants shouldn't even exist. I don't even know why clothes exist.

1342
02:54:16,300 --> 02:54:20,300
It's so uncomfy.

1343
02:54:20,300 --> 02:54:24,300
Does anyone else get a little overstimulated when they wear clothes?

1344
02:54:24,300 --> 02:54:28,300
Like, do you ever get this feeling when clothes rub against your skin?

1345
02:54:28,300 --> 02:54:32,300
And it feels like some sort of like burning sensation?

1346
02:54:38,300 --> 02:54:42,300
Over-stimulated.

1347
02:54:48,300 --> 02:54:52,300
Clothes exist so you won't get banned on YouTube.

1348
02:54:52,300 --> 02:54:56,300
True. True.

1349
02:54:56,300 --> 02:55:00,300
It's like not really like a burning burning,

1350
02:55:00,300 --> 02:55:04,300
not like a real burning, but like a

1351
02:55:04,300 --> 02:55:08,300
strange tingling sensation

1352
02:55:08,300 --> 02:55:12,300
that gets intensified on your skin

1353
02:55:12,300 --> 02:55:16,300
when certain material rubs against your skin

1354
02:55:16,300 --> 02:55:20,300
for a really long period of time. It's like an extreme tingling.

1355
02:55:26,300 --> 02:55:30,300
I get that.

1356
02:55:30,300 --> 02:55:34,300
I get overstimulated so I don't like wearing clothes.

1357
02:55:34,300 --> 02:55:38,300
Then I'm gonna rip it off.

1358
02:55:38,300 --> 02:55:42,300
Get it off me! Get this off me!

1359
02:55:56,300 --> 02:56:00,300
Get it off me!

1360
02:56:20,300 --> 02:56:24,300
And sometimes the heat doesn't make it any better.

1361
02:56:24,300 --> 02:56:28,300
Imagine being like, imagine getting that tingling feeling

1362
02:56:28,300 --> 02:56:32,300
and feeling hot and sweaty.

1363
02:56:32,300 --> 02:56:36,300
I hate it.

1364
02:56:54,300 --> 02:56:58,300
I love the cold air.

1365
02:56:58,300 --> 02:57:02,300
I love cold air.

1366
02:57:02,300 --> 02:57:06,300
My favorite season needs to be spring

1367
02:57:06,300 --> 02:57:10,300
but because spring doesn't

1368
02:57:10,300 --> 02:57:14,300
last very long where I am,

1369
02:57:14,300 --> 02:57:18,300
I don't think spring is going to last that long.

1370
02:57:18,300 --> 02:57:22,300
I don't think spring is going to last that long.

1371
02:57:22,300 --> 02:57:26,300
Spring lasts very long where I am.

1372
02:57:26,300 --> 02:57:30,300
Spring disappears in like a month or two

1373
02:57:30,300 --> 02:57:34,300
because spring doesn't last very long. Fall has kind of become

1374
02:57:34,300 --> 02:57:38,300
the stand-in since fall does kind of last

1375
02:57:38,300 --> 02:57:42,300
a little longer until it starts snowing.

1376
02:57:42,300 --> 02:57:46,300
Spring and fall are my favorite seasons.

1377
02:57:46,300 --> 02:57:50,300
I really like the smell of flowers

1378
02:57:50,300 --> 02:57:54,300
and the plants growing and stuff.

1379
02:57:54,300 --> 02:57:58,300
Everything's sprouting. I like it walking by.

1380
02:58:06,300 --> 02:58:10,300
What time do I shower at?

1381
02:58:10,300 --> 02:58:14,300
At the hottest. Like boiling.

1382
02:58:14,300 --> 02:58:18,300
If you were a normal human or to put their hand

1383
02:58:18,300 --> 02:58:22,300
in the water, it would burn you.

1384
02:58:22,300 --> 02:58:26,300
I shower at excruciatingly hot

1385
02:58:26,300 --> 02:58:30,300
hot water. I don't know why but when I feel

1386
02:58:30,300 --> 02:58:34,300
lukewarm water on me while I'm showering,

1387
02:58:34,300 --> 02:58:38,300
I lose it. I don't know. It's not hot enough. It's not hot enough.

1388
02:58:38,300 --> 02:58:42,300
I have to turn it up a little more. It's not hot enough. More. It's not hot enough.

1389
02:58:42,300 --> 02:58:46,300
More. And then it goes all the way at the end

1390
02:58:46,300 --> 02:58:50,300
and sometimes it's still not hot enough.

1391
02:59:00,300 --> 02:59:04,300
I gotta be careful though sometimes because

1392
02:59:04,300 --> 02:59:08,300
the play...

1393
02:59:12,300 --> 02:59:16,300
Sarah just scared me so bad. It's medication time.

1394
02:59:20,300 --> 02:59:24,300
My poor heart.

1395
02:59:34,300 --> 02:59:38,300
Let me grow my plants.

1396
02:59:46,300 --> 02:59:50,300
They're fine.

1397
02:59:50,300 --> 02:59:54,300
But yeah. I gotta be careful sometimes.

1398
02:59:54,300 --> 02:59:58,300
The hot water can get excruciatingly hot.

1399
02:59:58,300 --> 03:00:02,300
It's never the same temperature every time you use it.

1400
03:00:02,300 --> 03:00:06,300
So sometimes I guess the boiler

1401
03:00:06,300 --> 03:00:10,300
is doing really good for one night

1402
03:00:10,300 --> 03:00:14,300
and

1403
03:00:14,300 --> 03:00:18,300
it'd be really bad.

1404
03:00:22,300 --> 03:00:26,300
Sometimes it does burn me right away. That's why you gotta start in the center.

1405
03:00:26,300 --> 03:00:30,300
You gotta start warm and then turn it up slowly.

1406
03:00:32,300 --> 03:00:36,300
Okay.

1407
03:00:40,300 --> 03:00:44,300
I don't know where my water went.

1408
03:00:44,300 --> 03:00:48,300
I got it.

1409
03:00:48,300 --> 03:00:52,300
Yeah.

1410
03:01:02,300 --> 03:01:06,300
Sorry about that.

1411
03:01:06,300 --> 03:01:10,300
Hard on me to hear that at all.

1412
03:01:32,300 --> 03:01:36,300
I can't...

1413
03:01:36,300 --> 03:01:40,300
I can't...

1414
03:01:48,300 --> 03:01:52,300
I really don't think

1415
03:01:52,300 --> 03:01:56,300
V2P Studio likes me...

1416
03:01:56,300 --> 03:02:00,300
I really don't think V2P Studio likes me very much.

1417
03:02:00,300 --> 03:02:19,500
very much. Is that asthma medication I hear? It is. It is. I have everything wrong with

1418
03:02:19,500 --> 03:02:24,140
me. I check the full bingo book. I did bingo five times.

1419
03:03:20,460 --> 03:03:20,940
Hi.

1420
03:03:30,300 --> 03:03:31,580
You guys are so cute.

1421
03:03:38,700 --> 03:03:43,980
I'm putting on my cream from my spine and my shoulder.

1422
03:03:46,220 --> 03:03:47,020
It's all wet.

1423
03:03:50,300 --> 03:03:55,100
It's almost super wet.

1424
03:03:57,900 --> 03:03:58,300
Wow.

1425
03:04:20,380 --> 03:04:35,260
It's so creamy. It's like weird white, like

1426
03:04:37,500 --> 03:04:46,620
kind of milky, but it's like kind of clear, but slightly white. Cream looks weird.

1427
03:04:49,740 --> 03:04:50,220
It's,

1428
03:05:17,340 --> 03:05:17,820
It's

1429
03:05:19,500 --> 03:05:36,620
Are you the type to sleep in the cold with a blanket or the type to not wear it and be

1430
03:05:36,620 --> 03:05:40,620
woken in the middle of the night?

1431
03:05:40,620 --> 03:05:51,660
If it's really cold out I'd wear like three blankets because it gets really really cold here like super super cold

1432
03:05:51,660 --> 03:06:09,340
So three blankets, lots and lots of blankets

1433
03:06:22,620 --> 03:06:32,620
Honestly it's very... during the year of nurturing a passionate person just by the things you have to deal with

1434
03:06:32,620 --> 03:06:39,260
I appreciate that so so very much thank you thank you so much

1435
03:06:39,340 --> 03:06:47,660
It's very kind of you to say I I like to think that being positive uh

1436
03:06:49,100 --> 03:06:57,740
being staying positive keeps the energy high and keeps you at peace uh at peace of mind when you

1437
03:06:57,740 --> 03:07:06,780
know you're uh if you are sad all the time you feel kind of bad a lot of the time so being positive

1438
03:07:07,740 --> 03:07:16,460
wanting to keep the vibes high and not wanting to be you know sad all the time really helps

1439
03:07:18,620 --> 03:07:26,460
with that so I don't want to be that person so I do my very best when it comes to that

1440
03:07:37,500 --> 03:07:46,460
um

1441
03:07:46,460 --> 03:08:16,260
Okay, yeah, so I understand being sad though.

1442
03:08:16,980 --> 03:08:21,940
It cannot be helped. I have my days too. I'm sure everyone does too,

1443
03:08:22,580 --> 03:08:32,340
but they feel absolutely lonely or really sad and down and that's why I resonate with people

1444
03:08:32,340 --> 03:08:43,060
like that and I've felt that feeling of extreme loneliness before and I don't like it. So it's

1445
03:08:43,060 --> 03:08:51,140
kind of one of the reasons why I wanted to be a vtuber from the very beginning. I always thought

1446
03:08:51,140 --> 03:08:56,900
it was something nice, but even before that, just a streamer period, I wanted to

1447
03:08:59,460 --> 03:09:01,620
build a community of people who are like me,

1448
03:09:02,340 --> 03:09:14,340
people who need a place, people who need someone to talk to, someone to keep them company when

1449
03:09:14,340 --> 03:09:21,220
they are down and sad. So I always wanted to be someone like that for other people because I

1450
03:09:21,220 --> 03:09:28,900
didn't want no one to ever feel or felt, feel like how I felt in the past. Oh god, I'm such an emotional

1451
03:09:28,900 --> 03:09:44,820
person. What's wrong with me? I am like hanging on by a thread.

1452
03:09:58,980 --> 03:10:05,220
And it's very, very, very, very, very much okay to be sad. It's okay to feel the way you feel

1453
03:10:05,220 --> 03:10:12,340
because it's easier to get through your emotions and understand them so that you feel better

1454
03:10:12,340 --> 03:10:18,260
about everything else as long as you understand how you feel and how you are and the way

1455
03:10:18,580 --> 03:10:34,740
as an overall and then you'd know and you can move past it. You accept it and you move past it

1456
03:10:35,380 --> 03:10:40,420
and there's always going to be some things you can never get over. There are some things I don't

1457
03:10:40,420 --> 03:10:49,780
think I could never get over so I understand. It's already been six months since I lost my

1458
03:10:50,660 --> 03:11:04,980
fur baby and I think about him every day. I think about him every single day.

1459
03:11:05,620 --> 03:11:09,540
Yeah.

1460
03:11:20,740 --> 03:11:24,580
I have pictures of him if you guys ever want to see him one day.

1461
03:11:24,740 --> 03:11:33,140
I have some pictures and I hold the air.

1462
03:11:47,860 --> 03:11:50,180
I can always post them later, later on, okay?

1463
03:11:50,340 --> 03:11:56,500
I'm sorry to anyone who has also lost

1464
03:11:59,940 --> 03:12:10,740
a friend, not to say a friend or a family because he was my family. It was my friend.

1465
03:12:20,580 --> 03:12:41,140
So, baby, I'm going to

1466
03:12:41,620 --> 03:12:46,900
I'm probably going to one day ask you guys to show me your pets.

1467
03:12:48,980 --> 03:12:56,180
So, I'm prepared. I do love seeing everyone else's pets and it doesn't matter what kind of pet you

1468
03:12:56,180 --> 03:13:07,300
have. Cat, dog, goat, horse, pet chickens, spider,

1469
03:13:11,540 --> 03:13:16,740
axolotl fishes, any kind of fish, even a dangerous kind.

1470
03:13:16,820 --> 03:13:22,340
I love them dearly.

1471
03:13:25,140 --> 03:13:26,740
Life is amazing.

1472
03:13:34,820 --> 03:13:35,940
I think they're all cute.

1473
03:13:38,500 --> 03:13:46,500
They're your little friend. They're cute. I think snakes are really, really cute.

1474
03:13:46,820 --> 03:13:52,900
So, yeah, adorable little snoops and then a little tongue-tickle.

1475
03:14:06,580 --> 03:14:07,300
I love it.

1476
03:14:07,300 --> 03:14:17,700
I used to have a cat that knew how to turn on the faucet.

1477
03:14:19,220 --> 03:14:22,900
He really liked water and he would sit in it.

1478
03:14:25,620 --> 03:14:28,820
He'd always ask for a bath. I miss him too.

1479
03:14:29,540 --> 03:14:39,940
I had quite a lot of pets when I was growing up. I had a big heart for pets. Even had a pet pigeon.

1480
03:14:44,020 --> 03:14:49,540
One of my family members saved it during a storm. Its entire nest had fallen.

1481
03:14:50,180 --> 03:14:56,260
The others were unfortunately unable to be saved. They saved a little baby pigeon.

1482
03:14:57,060 --> 03:14:58,660
The other pet pigeon for a while.

1483
03:15:02,420 --> 03:15:07,140
We didn't really get a chance to give it a name because we weren't going to keep it.

1484
03:15:08,260 --> 03:15:09,700
This was a long time ago though.

1485
03:15:14,660 --> 03:15:23,700
I've had parrots. I've had five cats. I think we had two. We had two cats that we thought one was a

1486
03:15:24,660 --> 03:15:33,780
girl but turned out to be a boy. He had a little peepee.

1487
03:15:35,620 --> 03:15:42,500
It was a little peepee and we couldn't tell. It was a little peepee.

1488
03:15:46,340 --> 03:15:47,380
It was very cute.

1489
03:15:54,100 --> 03:15:58,420
He was my favorite. He was my favorite kitty.

1490
03:16:06,180 --> 03:16:11,300
We found out. We found out he was a boy when he got older.

1491
03:16:11,780 --> 03:16:29,220
Unfortunately we couldn't change his name. He had a name for years and we didn't know.

1492
03:16:31,380 --> 03:16:33,140
He had a name for years.

1493
03:16:35,780 --> 03:16:37,140
So he had a girly name.

1494
03:16:41,700 --> 03:16:46,740
He had a girly name. His name was Mimi.

1495
03:16:50,740 --> 03:16:59,220
His name was Mimi.

1496
03:17:11,300 --> 03:17:28,100
He had gimme pigs growing up. I knew someone who had a bunch of gimme pigs.

1497
03:17:31,860 --> 03:17:37,620
They had so many that they had to leave their apartment door open.

1498
03:17:37,860 --> 03:17:45,300
They had to leave it open and put a pin outside the door.

1499
03:17:46,740 --> 03:18:02,420
The gimme pigs were massive. They were huge. They had four of them.

1500
03:18:07,620 --> 03:18:17,620
I had a tuxedo cat.

1501
03:18:18,580 --> 03:18:27,620
We found out it was a male.

1502
03:18:38,740 --> 03:18:41,700
He made me feel so used to their name. We couldn't really change it.

1503
03:18:42,580 --> 03:18:46,020
They responded to the name. Imagine changing their name

1504
03:18:46,020 --> 03:18:48,100
as they got older. They would have been so confused.

1505
03:18:48,260 --> 03:18:56,100
It's not my name.

1506
03:18:56,100 --> 03:19:22,100
We kept the other people and let them run around the living room every once in a while to get

1507
03:19:22,100 --> 03:19:26,100
their exercise done. It's so cute. It's so cute.

1508
03:19:29,380 --> 03:19:38,100
I like that. I like that a lot.

1509
03:19:38,100 --> 03:19:58,100
Unfortunately, I don't live in a place where we can have outside pets.

1510
03:19:59,060 --> 03:20:02,580
I don't live in a place where that's possible.

1511
03:20:05,860 --> 03:20:07,780
So they endure, endure only.

1512
03:20:10,260 --> 03:20:18,100
A lot of harm outside. Endure, endure only.

1513
03:20:28,100 --> 03:20:53,060
I'm sorry. I'm quiet. I'm just reading what you guys are saying.

1514
03:20:53,060 --> 03:20:58,020
You guys bring a big smile to my face or hair.

1515
03:20:58,020 --> 03:21:06,980
I'm going to undercap the goblin king.

1516
03:21:06,980 --> 03:21:15,940
I thought we said jarred.

1517
03:21:37,940 --> 03:21:43,940
Don't eat rocks, please.

1518
03:21:43,940 --> 03:21:49,940
It's not good for you. It's not good for your tummy.

1519
03:21:49,940 --> 03:22:10,900
I had two birds a long time ago named Red and Wilma. That's cute.

1520
03:22:13,380 --> 03:22:19,620
Surprisingly, Mimi wasn't a big cat. Mimi looked very feminine.

1521
03:22:19,620 --> 03:22:25,780
Even when he got older, he was like the runt of his litter. He was very, very small.

1522
03:22:25,780 --> 03:22:30,580
He was tiny. And as he got older, he was extremely small then.

1523
03:22:30,580 --> 03:22:51,540
So he looked a lot like a female cat.

1524
03:22:51,700 --> 03:23:00,980
All right. I think it's time.

1525
03:23:05,140 --> 03:23:13,460
I can read. I was going to read your story, but we were vibing so hard.

1526
03:23:13,620 --> 03:23:29,380
And I, myself, am getting really sleepy. We can always save the story for another time.

1527
03:23:31,940 --> 03:23:41,380
Yeah, we all forgot, huh? We all forgot about the story.

1528
03:23:43,460 --> 03:24:10,500
That's probably going to be a lot of a majority of these streams where we derail quite a lot.

1529
03:24:10,980 --> 03:24:18,260
But it's fine if the vibes are right. I don't mind this. It's fun.

1530
03:24:25,140 --> 03:24:29,140
I love chatting with you guys and reading what you'll have to say.

1531
03:24:29,940 --> 03:24:34,340
That hurt mine.

1532
03:24:38,820 --> 03:24:46,100
Yeah, there was supposed to be a story time, but it was decided because of the game

1533
03:24:47,780 --> 03:24:58,580
crashing me. But I do want to start getting ready for bed. My medication does make me extremely tired,

1534
03:24:58,580 --> 03:25:04,900
so I'm like hanging in there now. My medication makes me really sleepy.

1535
03:25:13,060 --> 03:25:22,740
Yeah, I'm on a raid of Mercy. I will go say hi. Let's prepare to raid Mercy.

1536
03:25:29,300 --> 03:25:40,820
And then whoever is going to bed, please get rest. Everyone deserves to feel rested and feel good.

1537
03:25:42,900 --> 03:25:43,300
Sorry.

1538
03:25:43,300 --> 03:25:58,020
Okay, let me make sure I have this.

1539
03:26:05,860 --> 03:26:08,020

1540
03:26:13,300 --> 03:26:20,020

1541
03:26:28,100 --> 03:26:30,020

1542
03:26:38,820 --> 03:26:42,020
Ok.

1543
03:26:43,300 --> 03:26:57,940
Marcy is doing killer, killer 7. I think she's playing killer 7. So let's all say hi.

1544
03:26:57,940 --> 03:27:17,460
Bleeding Raid. Bleeding Raid. Thank you. I'll miss you. I'll miss you too. I'll see you guys.

1545
03:27:18,100 --> 03:27:28,020
Right. So I won't be streaming tomorrow. I'm gonna get some rest. Usually I don't stream

1546
03:27:28,900 --> 03:27:35,940
on um yeah for Gorn Raid. Usually I don't stream on Mondays and Tuesdays.

1547
03:27:36,660 --> 03:27:46,180
So today was an exception because I have doctor's appointments every week and Monday and Tuesday

1548
03:27:46,180 --> 03:27:57,300
are the days that I go to doctors. So and I can try and squeeze streams in on either day

1549
03:27:58,020 --> 03:28:03,300
but this is a high chance that I'll have an appointment that I would need to go to.

1550
03:28:04,420 --> 03:28:10,900
Usually they're in the noon and then I come I gotta come home and then I can stream

1551
03:28:11,300 --> 03:28:21,700
uh right after but because I'm on like heavy medication um I'm usually really tired before

1552
03:28:21,700 --> 03:28:38,900
the stream um so yeah there's that and uh I feel like there was something else that I completely
