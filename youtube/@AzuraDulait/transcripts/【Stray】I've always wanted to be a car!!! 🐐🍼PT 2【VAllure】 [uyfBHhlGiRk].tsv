205360	207360	Can you guys hear me?
207360	209360	Can you hear me?
226360	228360	I am.
229360	232360	Hi hi.
243360	245360	Hi.
245360	247360	How are you?
248360	250360	Hi hi.
251360	253360	How are my babies?
254360	257360	How are my sweet little bleeding hearts?
258360	260360	How are you all?
284360	287360	I am doing good.
287360	289360	I am doing good.
289360	291360	I am doing good.
291360	293360	I am doing good.
296360	299360	I am glad you are all doing really well.
299360	301360	I am doing okay.
303360	305360	I have some
307360	309360	some things
309360	312360	that we can talk about before we start.
312360	314360	Okay?
317360	319360	Oh wow!
319360	321360	Welcome in Penpal.
322360	324360	Hi Penpal.
324360	326360	Thank you Emmy for the red.
326360	328360	Welcome in everyone.
329360	331360	How are you all?
334360	336360	Hi hi.
342360	344360	Hi hi.
349360	352360	Hi hi. Welcome in. Welcome in.
355360	358360	I hope your stream was really fun.
358360	362360	I think it was your monetization stream.
363360	365360	Monetization celebration.
365360	367360	Congratulations.
367360	370360	Congratulations Emmy. Yay.
372360	374360	Hello.
380360	382360	Thank you.
387360	389360	Thank you thank you.
389360	391360	Yeah it was super fun.
391360	393360	I am glad you had fun!
393360	395360	It's so good.
402360	426360	While speaking of monetisation, though we'll probably have to wait a little longer, I'll have to take even extra steps to being a little more careful.
426360	441360	That also includes no more singing on stream as well, so we've got to be careful.
441360	468360	I got copyrighted by some fake singing for just acapella singing, which isn't because of just the copyright itself, it interferes with stuff.
468360	478360	I got copyrighted three times.
478360	506360	Youtube is strict against it, but they're also strict against the scammers, the fake people, copyrighting stuff that isn't actually theirs, so we'll just have to wait till things are safer, to start doing stuff again.
509360	513360	Thank you so much for the 6th dollar, the beer.
513360	514360	Otter.
519360	521360	Biscotti?
521360	523360	So you see your name?
523360	524360	I think I butcher that.
524360	525360	Like so bad.
525360	539360	So I'll be even extra careful.
539360	541360	Let me turn on my light.
541360	543360	I just realised it's really dark.
555360	557360	I head.

582360	584360	I head.
587360	589360	Your tube.
589360	591360	Your womb.
591360	593360	Yeah, it's a little poopy, but it's our head.
593360	595360	No worries.
595360	600360	All we can do is continue streaming like normal.
600360	603360	And enjoy us playing and stuff.
613360	618360	I'm just at.

777240	778520	thank you
778760	779780	Thank you, appreciate you
781720	783000	thank you, thank you
784760	786920	Very sweet, and I appreciate all of you
788940	796620	I am, thank you. I don't really know how to put into words my feelings. I'm really bad
797980	806460	with expressing how I feel. So I just kind of just power through everything because that's what
806460	815180	I'm used to doing. I'm not really good at emotions because I get really, really, really emotional
815740	820140	and I get nervous and then I don't want to get nervous and then I'll freak out and then I'll cry
820140	830300	and I'll be a baby and I want to be a baby. So you gotta be strong, me strong,
831420	837500	mama strong because if mama isn't strong then who is gonna be strong?
837500	843020	Mama has to be the strongest.
861980	866540	Play league if you want to. That's okay. I want to play straight today.
867260	869180	I really do. I want to play straight.
883180	884860	Yeah, it's car simulator.
884860	889020	Car simulator.
889020	917740	Thank you. Thank you all for fun. I appreciate it so much. Thank you friends.
917740	924540	That's $5 to pay. That's very sweet of you. I'm happy that you all stay and stick by me.
925820	930220	I may not be doing so well and I may be like the extreme smallest.
935580	941500	Thank you. I had hope so. I really do hope they do. Thank you Phoenix.
948460	957900	Hang on.
960700	963660	I feel like there was something else I was supposed to have mentioned. I completely
963660	978620	forgot. Don't mind my heart rate. My heart rate is like crazy high. It's fine, okay?
980700	985340	It's fine. Do not be concerned about it. It's perfectly fine.
985340	996940	A combination of not really sleeping and I had a thought on my mind so I didn't really get much sleep.
998860	1007500	I tried but I couldn't so it's just not on my heart rate, okay? Okay, okay.
1008060	1018540	I don't want you guys to constantly tell me to relax unless I really need to.
1019660	1026780	I'll say so otherwise, okay? I don't want you guys to be worried. It makes me a little sad when you
1026780	1032300	guys are extremely worried about me. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine, okay?
1036780	1037180	All right.
1041820	1043420	I would hope you would trust me.
1048220	1048620	All right.
1048780	1056220	Wow.
1056220	1058760	Ndo.
1078040	1080680	I didn't turn this on.
1081200	1083540	Uh oh.
1083540	1093540	Ie, we're fine. We're doing things.
1123540	1136540	So, this is part two of stray. If you guys haven't seen the start stray yet, make sure you watch part one.
1136540	1153540	So, remember to watch part one of this game session.
1153540	1159540	Okay, so this is portal. We're continuing from the last stream.
1159540	1176540	If you guys haven't already seen that, okay?
1176540	1204540	Ie, hang on. That's very strange.
1204540	1218540	It never did that before. Now it's doing it. That's really weird.
1218540	1225540	Okay, that's fine, I guess. When I click off the video, the sound goes away.
1226540	1235540	I want that to come back. How do you bring that back?
1235540	1242540	I know some games have it, and I know some games don't.
1242540	1248540	Oh, they have a thing where you can turn off and cap that.
1248540	1252540	Oh, for the distance though.
1252540	1259540	Oh, that's so cute.
1259540	1266540	Pause on focus? Pause on focus? Where is that?
1266540	1277540	This? No, that's not. That's not doing it either. It's so strange. Let me change the mode as well.
1277540	1283540	So, I'm not super bright in your face.
1284540	1290540	Dim lighting.
1290540	1296540	Oh, wait. Am I supposed to go back and then do it, accept it, and then do it?
1296540	1317540	No, that didn't work.
1317540	1322540	Now this is definitely going to be the last, I think.
1322540	1329540	I couldn't get through this. I promise. Watch me. I'm going to get straight through this game.
1329540	1335540	This whole next part.
1335540	1340540	Okay, give me one second.
1365540	1378540	Okay.
1378540	1384540	Right, we're on a rescue mission. This is where we last left off.
1384540	1399540	On rescue mission.
1399540	1405540	Look at all these zerk eggs. They will eat us. I can't do this.
1405540	1410540	I'm not as fast as you. The zerk will get me for sure.
1410540	1419540	Here, take this badge. My papa will recognise it. He will know that you're a friend.
1419540	1436540	You don't know I don't. Open the door for you.
1436540	1448540	Think shameless.
1448540	1455540	This place is really nice, even though it's the slums. I don't know why. I really like it.
1455540	1464540	Imagine if when this place was cleaned up, like super cleaned up and full of light.
1464540	1472540	The only reason why it's falling apart is because people haven't been taken care of it, because they've been gone for hundreds of years.
1472540	1497540	Imagine when this place was all cleaned up. It looked super nice.
1497540	1502540	I don't like the music. It's making me nervous.
1502540	1510540	Look at how huge this wall is.
1510540	1518540	I remember it. It was a symbol of the division between those and the slums in the midtown.
1518540	1526540	The fact that they kept throwing their garbage down here won't man.
1526540	1534540	What a horrible thing to do. Maybe that's why they failed.
1548540	1569540	Dead end. I'm so nervous. I'm so nervous.
1570540	1595540	Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
1596540	1604540	I can't jump. No!
1604540	1611540	I couldn't jump. It wouldn't let me jump. It didn't give me the option.
1611540	1613540	That's so dumb.
1641540	1657540	No, no, no, no, no!
1657540	1676540	Now what? Oh, under!
1676540	1678540	Mae'n siwet, mae'n siwet.

1798540	1800540	Y Llywodraeth?
1800540	1825540	I can go that way. What's up here?
1825540	1842540	There's two ways to go up here and then I can't come back down or over here.
1842540	1855540	Well, a memory.
1855540	1867540	The scientist I used to work for always said he wanted to retire to a little cottage fishing all day long.
1867540	1878540	Of course, that was not a possibility in the city and nobody could have done that for at least hundreds of years.
1878540	1888540	Let me get to the outside. We found ourselves a little cottage, the harmless fishing rod and a lot of books.
1888540	1902540	I think that's what the scientist would have wanted. But first, we should go find out.
1902540	1929540	I could not be here.
1929540	1958540	Let's go find out.
1959540	1976540	This is very relaxing. This comes my heart. I like this very much.
1976540	1991540	Guys, how is the game audio so far by the way?
2006540	2019540	It's fine. Audio is fine. Sounds good to me.
2020540	2038540	That was a good little song. Time to go back on to our adventure. Nice relaxation time.
2038540	2058540	Big stretch.
2058540	2078540	You mean car? Clearly I'm a car. What do you mean?
2089540	2096540	Obviously a car.
2096540	2108540	I want to make sure everyone can still hear the game.
2108540	2130540	What are we doing here? I'm assuming I have to go over there. Do I just jump over? Is there anything I have to do with this stuff here?
2130540	2146540	I don't have anything. It's an electric generator. It seems to require some other part of function.
2160540	2176540	It's all gloo-y out here.
2190540	2203540	That was where I was just going to come either way. A window.
2221540	2238540	Egg vincar.
2238540	2251540	Why are the zircs so dirty?
2268540	2275540	And two zircs. They mutated after the humans disappeared.
2275540	2287540	So now they eat everything and anything. Even metal.
2287540	2293540	Wait, you're in a house there. Who are you?
2293540	2303540	That's my badge. You're wearing. How did you find it? Did my son send you? Oh, shameless. You clever boy.
2303540	2313540	I've been here alone for ages. I came here to test the flux or what it didn't go as planned.
2313540	2321540	I wish I could go back home. I miss my son dearly.
2321540	2339540	You can have a lot around the house if you want, but I have no idea how to escape this place.
2339540	2347540	Who is this?
2347540	2353540	I've seen humans wear costumes like this.
2353540	2358540	They were small and running around, making lots of noise. Children.
2358540	2367540	Oh yes, I remember now. Yeah, they were children. The streets felt much more alive with them.
2367540	2382540	Is their voice always like this? Yeah. I hope it doesn't bother you. I'm sorry.
2382540	2392540	You want the difficulty they brought. You don't seem to love them very much.
2392540	2412540	Is that the same thing? Seems like it.
2412540	2425540	Wow.
2425540	2434540	I'll stop. Oh, I cute.
2434540	2443540	That's a bear.
2443540	2457540	Sometimes she goes Bremlin and it's adorable. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm pretty old man.
2457540	2467540	Hey, be careful with that defluxer. A full charge it can explode zirks like conferee.
2467540	2477540	This baby needs 1.21 gigawatts to work. And the only thing around here with that kind of juice is the generator outside the house.
2477540	2484540	The problem is that it won't start. I think a fuse blew.
2484540	2489540	And with all the zirks around it's too dangerous for me to go out and fix it.
2489540	2500540	I'm not fast enough, but you just might be. If you can reach the generator and replace the fuse, I should be able to get the defluxer recharged.
2500540	2515540	Come on, follow me. I'll show you what they do.
2515540	2544540	Is there anything else here?
2545540	2555540	I just like jumping on things and destroying stuff. It's fun.
2555540	2567540	I like the sliding doors.
2568540	2573540	Here, it's like this fuse. It's brand new.
2573540	2578540	Turning on the generator will be loud so expect some zirks.
2578540	2586540	Once you fix the generator, I should be able to charge the end kickstart, the defluxer.
2586540	2596540	You just need to follow this cable, change the fuse, then meet me back here.
2596540	2614540	Cars have the biggest claws, did you know?
2626540	2647540	May I sleep to your voice? Yeah, you can. Of course you can. That's perfectly fine.
2678540	2683540	Is that it? Are you done? Is that over?
2683540	2697540	Did I come back?
2697540	2707540	I think that's it.
2707540	2720540	Oh my God! Ah no!
2720540	2735540	I didn't even see it though.
2735540	2747540	Excited robot noises. Super excited robot noises.
2747540	2771540	Amazing you got the generator back on. Yes!
2771540	2778540	Have you seen how powerful the defluxer is? It's definitely our way out of here.
2778540	2785540	Firstly, listening to your stream yesterday, already getting sleepy again. It's inevitable.
2785540	2796540	Just accept your fate and fall asleep fall.
2796540	2820540	Wait a minute, I might be able to mount this defluxer to your drone.
2820540	2827540	It worked. The defluxer is now installed on your fancy drone here.
2827540	2834540	It's not meant to run off such a small power source. If you use it too much, it cannot function.
2834540	2839540	Just remember, it's dangerous. Now let's go back to the village.
2839540	2859540	I'm coming home son. I'm coming home my baby. I'm coming home.
2859540	2871540	How do you turn it on?
2871540	2877540	I need to help Doc get back to the slums. I have to defluxer now.
2877540	2892540	Oh, it's because I'm messing around. I'm sorry.
2892540	2901540	Oh.
2901540	2908540	Yeah, I'm aware. Take out all the zerk so we can get through.
2908540	2916540	Oh. Wow, it's working great, but I was expecting it can overheat.
2916540	2924540	Let it cool for a bit when that happens. I hope it will last until we reach the village.
2924540	2949540	That's how you use it.
2949540	2963540	That switch doesn't work. It looks like the electricity has been cut.
2963540	2982540	There must be a way to open the door.
2982540	2995540	Like this?
2995540	3004540	Wait, I think I know.
3004540	3017540	Like this? I'm smart. I'm so smart.
3017540	3034540	I'm intelligent.
3034540	3046540	Oh, hello.
3064540	3089540	I like having a way to protect myself. I feel so much safer when I can kill things.
3089540	3098540	Murdering things is fun. It's fine. In a game, of course. In a game.
3098540	3123540	Oh. Run!
3124540	3128540	That was close. Let's go back home.
3128540	3154540	I'm on the door. He was dying.
3154540	3170540	This looks so, like, interesting to live, you know? Like everywhere you go, there's probably, like, these are probably like storefronts or something. Homes. You'd pass by.
3171540	3183540	I don't know why. I know inner city is definitely not good to live in, but it looks so fun.
3183540	3199540	We're home.
3200540	3209540	Hello.
3209540	3218540	I found the sun. I heard.
3218540	3223540	I go already am.
3223540	3230540	Thanks for saving Doc, little friend. It's great to see the shame. This is no longer alone.
3230540	3244540	Now we know that we can fight back against the Zergs. Mama has been waiting for you by the Zergs.
3244540	3255540	Doc and Shamans look happy. I think we did a good thing together.
3255540	3268540	Hey, Daddy. What's up, Rosie? Billy? You know my son, Shamans? It's thanks to him that I came back from that damn place.
3268540	3292540	Yeah, sure. I thought happy is back. Aw. That's so sweet.
3293540	3312540	Aw. No go. Did I do everything here? I think I did everything here. I have nothing else on my inventory.
3312540	3321540	We ran out 51% through the game.
3321540	3336540	It's time to move on. Hi. Mama was waiting for you on his boat. You can join him, but have you done everything you wanted here? I think so.
3336540	3348540	I'll close the door behind you. Don't want any Zergs coming through. I think so, right? Was there anything else we needed to do?
3348540	3361540	Hi there. Hi.
3362540	3371540	The Fluxer is actually is really just a giant LED light. It's true. You will.
3371540	3379540	Yeah, we're leaving. Well, we're going to go a little deeper, I think. We're going to go into the sewers next.
3379540	3386540	I love this place. So nice.

3467540	3472540	Was there even anyone in here? I remember scratching on the door. Surgery?
3474540	3476540	Is that a robot doctor?
3481540	3485540	I think we leave now. I don't think we have anything else to do here.
3486540	3488540	I think we can go.
3495540	3497540	Y, y, y.
3497540	3499540	Y, y, y.
3499540	3501540	Ysle. Ysle.

3547540	3549540	Ysle.
3549540	3551540	Ysle.
3551540	3553540	Ysle.
3553540	3573060	I can't believe you fell back and got the defluxer with this now we can go find both
3573780	3582580	Let's go. Let's go. Welcome everyone and anyone who's now joining in. It's good to have you.
3585300	3586580	I hope that you'll have me.
3586580	3596580	This is hilarious.
3601860	3603460	Are they a doctor or a mechanic?
3609620	3613460	Since the majority of them don't even know how to fix other machinery,
3613460	3616180	I'd say they are robot doctor.
3623940	3633460	Oh, I can zoom in.
3633460	3643460	This place is creepy.
3663460	3675460	I don't see any way to open this gate. Can you take a look on the other side?
3676180	3677460	Of course.
3687380	3695460	I don't like what I'm seeing over there.
3695460	3705460	Excuse me, I'm sorry.
3725460	3745460	Disgusting. I sneezed. Did I sneeze? I didn't even notice, but I actually sneezed.
3745460	3761460	It's all icky, sticky, squelchy. Thank you.
3761460	3771460	Thank you.
3775460	3781460	I've never been this far out of the slums with you here. I'm not even scared.
3781460	3789460	Are you guys not scared with me here?
3789460	3793460	Are you guys not scared?
3793460	3795460	They're watching us.
3795460	3801460	Look at it. It's watching us.
3801460	3811460	Are you guys not scared?
3811460	3821460	Are you guys not scared?
3821460	3831460	I'm not scared at all.
3831460	3841460	I'm not scared at all.
3841460	3851460	Are you guys not scared?
3851460	3879460	All this old machinery is broken now. I think we can only open it manually.
3879460	3889460	Are you guys not scared?
3889460	3899460	Are you guys scared?
3899460	3917460	Quick. Jump below the door. It won't hold for long.
3917460	3923460	I got it. I'm going.
3923460	3929460	I can't go with you, but I won't stop looking for a way.
3929460	3939460	We better not. I don't want to leave Momo.
3939460	3957460	We're leaving you?
3957460	3969460	He wouldn't have made it in here anyways.
3969460	3983460	Oh my gosh.
3983460	4009460	Oh no, there's a robot.
4009460	4019460	Oh.
4019460	4047460	Oh no.
4047460	4073460	I'm not taking chances. I'm still scared.
4073460	4099460	Oh my gosh.
4099460	4111460	I mean I can't go that way. What's over here? There's something over here?
4111460	4121460	A memory.
4121460	4133460	The sewer system. Yes, I remember now. Clean water was scarce.
4133460	4141460	The city was supplied by a huge machinery that dug deep into the earth.
4141460	4149460	It was like everything else. It was rationed out to sustain people.
4149460	4153460	Oh my gosh. My brain is lagging.
4153460	4165460	Just like everything else, it was rationed out to sustain people during times of drought.
4165460	4173460	Oh boy.
4173460	4177460	Dyslexia is hitting me really hard right now.
4177460	4185460	Give me one second.
4185460	4195460	I can read.
4195460	4199460	The scientists showed me the blueprint of the water tanks.
4199460	4211460	They are huge and contain a whole building in them.
4211460	4233460	Is there anything else? No.
4233460	4257460	Oh.
4257460	4265460	Okay.
4265460	4283460	Is there any other memories? I don't want to miss a memory. No. Here.
4283460	4287460	It's so dangerous.
4287460	4305460	Can you cast a break out? I would be traumatized after dealing with pipes.
4305460	4317460	Oh boy.
4317460	4323460	So so. Thank you mom and mister Vondella to be.
4323460	4333460	If you're looking for praise. You've all been very, very good for me.
4333460	4359460	Good baby crabs. My sweet little things.
4359460	4369460	Can I just go this way? Can I just avoid them?
4369460	4379460	Oh oh oh shit.
4379460	4389460	I have to clear them out one by one.
4389460	4399460	Okay.
4419460	4429460	Okay.
4429460	4439460	Are you fine?
4459460	4479460	Get off me.
4479460	4489460	Get off me.
4489460	4513460	Oh no.
4513460	4521460	What is this place? This looks extremely creepy.
4521460	4535460	Am I missing something? Am I missing something?
4535460	4561460	I'm so scared. I'm procrastinating because I don't want to go home.
4561460	4571460	Can you avoid some of those? There's a lot of eggs. I can avoid some of the eggs. Probably not all of them because loud noises activate them.
4571460	4585460	So if I would have left a majority of those eggs out and then hit that lever, all of them probably would have been activated along with the ones coming out of the door.
4585460	4595460	And they also activate when you get really close to them.
4595460	4613460	What the fuck?
4613460	4623460	Ah! Ah! Ah!
4643460	4653460	Oh shit!
4653460	4671460	Can I just run? Oh there's too many. This is so dangerous.
4671460	4681460	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
4681460	4691460	Can I just go?
4691460	4711460	Oh my god. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
4712460	4720460	OK. You're OK.
4720460	4737460	All of those terrifying.
4737460	4755460	Hold on.
4755460	4784460	Are they closed?
4784460	4813460	Uh-oh.
4814460	4824460	Oh.
4824460	4852460	Oh no. Oh no. I walk them up, I walk them up, I walk them up. I walk them up, I walk them up, I walk them up.

5173880	5179880	But the fluxer is completely destroyed now. I have to be careful.
5181880	5183880	No.
5185880	5189880	The fluxer was what made me brave without it. I am nothing.
5203880	5205880	Was there anything else?
5217880	5221880	So much water. So much wet.
5233880	5235880	I made it.
5237880	5239880	I'm here. Did I miss a memory?
5239880	5241880	I think I missed a memory.
5243880	5245880	I made it.
5245880	5247880	Traveller from the sewers.
5249880	5251880	I made it.
5253880	5255880	I made it.
5255880	5257880	I made it.
5257880	5259880	I made it.
5259880	5261880	I made it.
5261880	5263880	Traveller from the sewers.
5263880	5265880	I want to see one of you in ages.
5267880	5269880	Are you the one who contacted us earlier?
5269880	5271880	A little outsider?
5271880	5275880	Balsahar, the outsider, has been expecting you.
5275880	5279880	He's meditating at the top of our village.
5279880	5281880	Thank you.
5281880	5283880	Baladan.
5283880	5287880	Ant village. I think I missed a memory.
5287880	5289880	Let me see.
5291880	5293880	No.
5295880	5297880	I missed a memory.
5297880	5299880	Oh no.
5303880	5307880	I missed a memory.
5307880	5309880	I wonder what that memory was.
5317880	5319880	Oh, hang on.
5319880	5327080	ond? I'm not moving on. I think this crashed.
5334280	5337080	Yeah, this crashed. Give me one second.
5349880	5351880	I'm not moving on. I think this crashed. Give me one second.
5359880	5365880	Wow, hello. It's me. Mario.
5370880	5371880	Okay.
5379880	5395880	My only weapon is gone, you know? This machine, the scientist, has introduced one of the others.
5399880	5403880	He was sick. This was his last hope. He walked into the machine.
5403880	5409880	But I wasn't with him. He was alone. What was he doing?
5409880	5419880	Isn't that the machine that was in the room when we first got B12?
5423880	5429880	He uploaded himself into the computer and everything was different.
5433880	5443880	But the upload something went wrong. He was stuck for hundreds of years until a little cat appeared.
5449880	5461880	Was it? It was me. I was the scientist. I was human.
5464880	5467880	I need a moment.
5472880	5479880	Oh no. Oh no.
5479880	5498880	I'm sorry. I need a moment. I don't feel like talking right now.
5498880	5509880	Oh, that's understandable. Go ahead. We just look around. Something scratch.
5529880	5536880	I get an achievement for that.
5536880	5538880	I'm a tree.
5567880	5569880	I'm a tree.
5573880	5575880	I'm a tree.
5584880	5586880	I'm a tree.
5596880	5605880	What else have I forgotten?
5605880	5611880	Unless I've had parents, friends. What happened to everyone?
5611880	5619880	I wanted to open the city, but is there even anyone left to say?
5627880	5629880	It's over here.
5637880	5639880	That's where I came from.
5642880	5644880	Up up below.
5656880	5666880	I blushed. Wait, I sneezed again? When did I sneeze? What? I don't... How come I never remember?
5666880	5672880	I don't remember sneezing. What is this?
5674880	5676880	I really sneezed.
5682880	5684880	Thank you.
5687880	5689880	Thank you.
5704880	5707880	I gotta need a scratchy.
5716880	5718880	I'm hungry.
5722880	5736880	I'm hungry. Why? I'm hungry. Why? Why?
5736880	5738880	I'm hungry.
5743880	5748880	Toast time. I want toast. I gotta go get bread though.
5752880	5754880	I'll get it after.
5754880	5758880	I'll get an orange. I don't have an orange.
5762880	5764880	What is this?
5766880	5768880	I'll get an orange.
5778880	5780880	My balls are hard.
5781880	5790880	Hey, don't you know not to interrupt a fellow during his transcendental meditation?
5790880	5801880	Oh, it's you. You were with Momo when we received a call earlier. I'm glad to meet you at last little outsider.
5801880	5813880	You know Momo and Doc, so you're already familiar with those outsiders. I miss them, and memory brings me peace.
5820880	5831880	Momo slyt, Momo staed yn y slums. I heard you helped find Doc in Clementine. She's in Midtown now.
5831880	5841880	If you still want to see the outside, she's the one who can get you there. Apparently she had some kind of plan to leave the city.
5841880	5853880	Here, take this. This is meaning you can never leave or her address in the back of this picture. Clementine's picture.
5854880	5871880	Come in a new item. To reach in Midtown, climb up our little village. It should be easy for a Dick Styrious, one like you.
5871880	5882880	If you manage to reach the outside, you will be the very first. I would wish you good luck, but you don't need it. I believe in you.
5882880	5890880	He believes in me. Yeah.
5890880	5906880	If you had to pick one Pokemon as your partner, what would it be? Either Weed Cat or Lovatar. I really like Lovatar. I have a Lovatar stuffy.
5906880	5916880	Lovatar.
5916880	5925880	Weed Cat or Lovatar. Lovatar.
5925880	5934880	Or any of the Eevee evolutions.
5934880	5953880	Especially the grass evolution of Eevee. It's my favorite evolution. It doesn't get much love, but I love it.
5953880	5978880	Leafeon. Yeah, Leafeon.
5978880	5995880	Sorry, sorry.
5996880	6015880	Did you know that Vaporeon is... Don't start with that here, alright? Don't start with that.
6015880	6023880	Don't start. I'm giving my eye on you.
6023880	6033880	Good night Azura. I hope you have fun. Good night to you too. Have a good night.
6033880	6059880	Mum.
6059880	6069880	I love Peter. I can't stop hearing him. Oh my gosh.
6089880	6099880	No.
6119880	6138880	Hang on. Give me a second.
6179880	6208880	I'm not falling asleep, I swear.
6208880	6221880	I'm not falling asleep. I'm looking at pizza.
6238880	6265880	I'm not falling asleep.
6265880	6283880	Let me stretch.
6283880	6293880	The eapiness is starting to hit me.
6313880	6342880	I'm getting pizza.
6342880	6357880	Yeah, we ordered a pizza.
6357880	6366880	Guys, I'm already done, so please get yourself a snack, water or something to drink. Get a blankie and get comfy.
6366880	6375880	Mine will probably take time to get here, but I'm going to get it.
6375880	6382880	I really shouldn't, but I've been craving a pizza for like two weeks.
6382880	6397880	I've been craving pizza since before they built when we were chatting about pizza in the chat. I still haven't forgotten.
6397880	6412880	I haven't had pizza since then. Even before that. I haven't had pizza in a long time.
6412880	6422880	Pizza is very expensive over here. It's very expensive.
6422880	6441880	It's fine. You don't worry about it. It's fine.
6441880	6451880	Let me put this in the way you keep playing.
6451880	6474880	It's fine.
6474880	6494880	No, it's a bad drink.
6504880	6524880	It's fine.
6524880	6550880	No break.
6550880	6567880	Let me grab this.
6567880	6577880	Oh my God, I am a river. You don't have to do that. Thank you. Thank you for the 30. Thank you.
6577880	6585880	You're insane. Thank you.
6607880	6617880	Thank you.
6638880	6649880	Oh, how cute. My legs are, I feel like jelly. It was sitting for so long.
6649880	6666880	Okay.
6666880	6675880	Is it an honor? Is it an honor for you?
6675880	6685880	First week young ladies will, that's so sweet of you. Oh my God. That's so very sweet of you. Thank you.
6685880	6697880	Thank you. Thank you. Let's continue with the game while we wait for foods to come.
6697880	6707880	Let me take another small break.
6707880	6713880	Where is the cave? Sorry for shutting down earlier.
6713880	6722880	I'm human, probably the last in the world. Now it was left to me.
6722880	6730880	So much has come back to me. How much have I forgotten?
6730880	6742880	Maybe if we find something, we can restore my memories and get you back home at the same time.
6742880	6753880	So we can go back down and find out more, the companions are head onward to Mattel.
6753880	6758880	You should go find Clementine. Oh, nothing has happened to her.
6758880	6764880	Clementine at the top of our village and find a path to reach Mattel.
6764880	6774880	But before we do that, we're going to have a look around.
6774880	6780880	Oh, I want to go down. I want to go down. I want to look around for us.
6780880	6790880	Now we can talk to people, I think.
6790880	6797880	This food is actually horrible, but it's the only thing around.
6797880	6811880	I'll have to unscrew my front casing if I keep eating this trash.
6811880	6822880	Maybe I should open my own place because I really can't get any worse than that.
6822880	6832880	A GPU done, all you can eat buffet. Imagine that. I can eat that stuff forever.
6833880	6845880	People call me the Teng Chef. I specialize in upcycling leftovers.
6846880	6854880	Raman. Raman C45. That's my secret ingredient.
6854880	6872880	Who told you about the secret ingredient?
6872880	6881880	It's a kitchen.
6881880	6886880	Can I go down there? I can.
6886880	6890880	Mine. Thanks.
6890880	6911880	Flower.
6911880	6920880	Where's the stove?
6920880	6931880	It's a cute little area to lay down.
6931880	6939880	It's another one of those spots.
6939880	6953880	Raman. Raman GPU done.
6953880	6960880	I've only ever had udon once, but I didn't have all the other stuff in it. It was just the noodles.
6960880	6977880	I've only had udon noodles. I haven't had the other stuff they put in it.
6977880	6988880	I can't eat pre-packaged ramen noodles because it messes with my stomach for some reason.
6988880	6996880	My stomach can't digest the packaged ramen, so I end up like it comes back up after like 10 minutes.
6997880	7006880	I can not even very long. It hurts. It makes my tummy hurt a lot.
7006880	7017880	So I can only eat actual freshly cooked ramen.
7018880	7024880	I used to eat at a certain place.
7024880	7030880	They make the best ramen. It tastes so good.
7030880	7036880	It's the only place that I can actually stomach eating it.
7036880	7046880	Other than that, I can't stomach anything else.
7047880	7066880	Raman. Raman.
7066880	7078880	We don't have many Raman places that are made traditionally.
7078880	7087880	There are people who are learning how to make it, but they are making it.
7087880	7091880	It doesn't taste good.
7091880	7097880	It doesn't taste very good. It doesn't taste like traditional ramen at all.
7097880	7106880	That's why there's only so many places that I will go to to make ramen really good, in my opinion.
7121880	7143880	Raman. Raman.
7143880	7158880	Yeah. It isn't many places.
7158880	7162880	I have a car too.
7162880	7168880	One thing I don't like about my city is that there are no dedicated ramen places.
7168880	7173880	What are they about to see in the world though?
7173880	7178880	Or soba. I like yaki soba.
7178880	7182880	But I think that's the only packaged one that I can eat.
7182880	7186880	I can eat packaged yaki soba.
7186880	7190880	I think it's made very differently.
7190880	7194880	I can eat that and it tastes so good.
7194880	7209880	I wish I had the one I could tell you.
7209880	7219880	Zori reviews.
7219880	7225880	I got a few very few ramen places around here, but they're just okay, sadly.
7225880	7235880	This is a way of life.
7235880	7239880	I have a few sushi places. We have everything.
7239880	7245880	I wish we had more.
7245880	7264880	More Asian cuisine.
7264880	7269880	Oh hello there. It has been so long since we've had a visitor.
7269880	7272880	We'll accept those dimsirks of course.
7272880	7277880	Imagine if we could harness their power.
7277880	7280880	Have them run in a wheel or something.
7280880	7286880	Just to waste the potential.
7286880	7293880	When I grow up, I want to be great like Aunt Clementine.
7293880	7297880	I look so new.
7297880	7302880	I look like such a new robot.
7302880	7322880	I wanted to explore like she did, but the grown-ups verbatised the antithlet.
7323880	7337880	Is there anything else around here?
7337880	7347880	Zia's electric zerk everywhere.
7347880	7369880	Why don't you wake up?
7369880	7375880	We have a lot of robots that are pretty rusty.
7375880	7382880	All the old robots are kind of rusty.
7382880	7386880	They have a little bit of rust on them.
7386880	7395880	In this language, a companion robot made it up from scratch. How impressive.
7395880	7399880	I remember it happening when I was in the network.
7399880	7409880	I don't know when exactly, but at one time all the communications started to switch to the symbols.
7409880	7414880	I was stuck in a computer and alone for a long time.
7414880	7421880	So I translated every symbol in word one by one until I was able to understand everything.
7421880	7429880	Now that I'm out, I know their language. I'm curious to hear all they have to say.
7429880	7437880	I hate that gap. I can't believe I missed a memory.
7451880	7467880	Does this wake them up?
7481880	7497880	The painter.
7497880	7507880	Mae. Do you know there are more than 900 sads of white pant?
7507880	7526880	I don't tell anyone, but I'm creating my own shade of pant.
7526880	7531880	I'm calling it garbage brown.
7531880	7536880	Ew. White garbage brown.
7536880	7540880	Hang on, this is a door. I'll be right back.

8185480	8191880	I was a bellbut many cycles ago but I repurposed myself into a treasure hunter.
8191880	8200200	Don't be fooled by the sound of it. It can be hard and gruesome just like this arm I just found.
8203160	8207640	Oh, I mean they lost an arm. Oh, they did. They found a new arm.
8210200	8212280	For a fellow may he rest in peace.
8222600	8226120	Isn't it like lavender? Yeah, it's called periwinkle.
8227720	8236440	It's a color that tricks you. It's my favorite color that tricks you in the spectrum because it looks like it's purple, but it's actually blue.
8252840	8254840	It's my favorite color.
8254840	8256840	I love the color.
8275320	8278760	Is that what I call a junk? I call it treasure.
8278760	8289240	Yeah, it's one of my favorite, favorite colors. I like baby colors like baby blue,
8290920	8299400	yellow, but really, really light yellow, orange, but super light. I like the little baby color spectrum.
8302840	8303800	It's my favorite.
8303800	8308520	It's gay, can I? Do I just go back the same way?
8319560	8321560	This way.
8326760	8333080	Indeed. Sorry for leaving early again. Oh, that's okay. Don't worry about it.

9077440	9078240	How are you?
9080480	9083600	Oh, I heard it's a rare plant. Thank you.
9084400	9088960	Bona mam. Thank you so much here as a reward to my badge.
9094880	9101280	It looks so good. It looks so good with it. It looks, it looks, it looks.
9106480	9111600	Not you, but it as in like the thingy that's on my back. It looks so good with it.
9111600	9114960	All right. I'll take care now. I'll see you friend.
9131680	9138240	I'm bored. I'm claiming that I used the whole classes here so you learn a lot of cool stuff.
9141600	9148960	It's like a little classroom. That's so cute.
9172400	9183360	Oh. Wait, am I supposed to jump on that?
9185600	9190960	No? Oh. It just took me all the way back. No.
9198240	9199120	I'll go back up.
9202400	9217760	Only up, only up. Wait, can I knock these over? Oh.
9219120	9224400	I want to knock those over. Do you want to jump over there? I can't.
9224400	9228560	Is it? It's a second.
9255120	9270560	You guys see uncle and son? Can you tell me that everyone's a sister? Sure. You can do that.
9271520	9280000	Up to daisy, up to daisy.
9282400	9288000	I feel like I'm forgetting something. Is there memory that I forgot about? No, I think there's only one.
9288000	9303440	I go up here.
9303440	9320880	It looks like the sun up there, but you know it's not. Fake white lights.
9324640	9327680	Is it normal for a cat to be obsessed with socks?
9327680	9331120	I suppose so.
9335760	9339280	I know my cat used to be obsessed with my shoes.
9342240	9345120	He'd lay on my shoes all the time.
9357680	9375120	I'm sorry for a fourth size of pizza. I'm having a fourth slice. This kills me.
9375120	9385040	I'm going to drink.
9397920	9402560	You like seafood?
9403360	9412000	You like seafood?
9412000	9429440	You do? You do like seafood?
9429440	9440880	You do? You do like seafood?
9459440	9488880	No, I spilled it everywhere. No, my blanket.
9489680	9492480	No, I got to suck it out of the blanket.
9497840	9510880	No, it's all wet.
9510880	9532320	I'm back. You're all no fun.
9532320	9542400	I like the little detail of the tail sticking up.
9545040	9548880	The tail sticking up literally for a cat is a greeting, by the way.
9550560	9553360	When a cat's tail sticks up, it's literally saying hello.
9554480	9561440	So every time robot comes out, the tail sticks up. I think that's so cute. Such a cute detail.
9562320	9568160	No manners.
9572720	9574400	I don't know what you're talking about.
9574400	9591200	I completely forgotten this kind of transportation existence.
9592640	9596960	You can ride anywhere in the city. People used to take it to go to work.
9597520	9602400	I used to take it too. Every morning after saying goodbye to my family at home.
9605360	9612240	I remember I was doing this for them. They were gone now. It was a long ago.
9615360	9619360	You wanted to see the outside, but does that even matter anymore?
9620320	9622800	What happened to them? What happened to everyone?
9622960	9633760	Anyway, we're near Mitano. Let's find this Clementine.
9638800	9641520	We can have a picture of her. We have a picture of her.
9642160	9648640	We can show it so some of the companions are on here. Maybe they'll point us in the right direction.
9648640	9659600	Make your memory.
9670640	9675600	That's a transdation.
9678640	9687600	That's a transdation.
9687600	9702560	I don't know what to say.
9702560	9708560	I don't know what to say.
9708560	9712560	Translay it.
9712560	9718080	Clothes due to pandemic restrictions, please do not enter.
9718080	9722160	Any violations of rules can result heavy prison sentence.
9723040	9726160	Were the people in the lower section sick?
9731840	9733520	Were they sick?
9738880	9739520	I remember.
9742560	9746880	There's so many books here.
9748880	9754640	Deterian, test legacy, the ethics of artificial intelligence.
9755360	9759840	I recognise some of these books. I have a library.
9760640	9765040	I remember nothing was quiet like the smell of books in the turn of payage.
9765840	9767920	It was a feeling almost like comfort.
9767920	9776880	A book was like spending time with someone.
9776880	9790880	Miao. Miao. Miao. Miao. Miao. Miao.
9791680	9793680	Hee hee. What a cute face.
9797280	9801840	Lidoc.
9807760	9815840	I know something.
9820880	9831840	I don't know what to say.
9831840	9841840	I don't know what to say.
9841840	9852800	I don't know what to say.
9863920	9865200	Translation wanted.
9865200	9870800	Clementine, trouble maker, outsider, rebellious, please report any sightings.
9872400	9872800	Yeah.
9874400	9876000	I told you five times.
9877200	9879280	You can't run around like that.
9879280	9880240	It's dangerous.
9881680	9884960	Hey, this is the first time I've seen this kind of robot.
9884960	9886080	He looks so fluffy.
9889120	9892640	Oh, it's the girl displayed on this one screen, right?
9893360	9894720	You should ask somebody else.
9894720	9897440	I'm just busy with yours here to know anything.
9902640	9904000	No, I already read that.
9904000	9906720	Oh, can I talk to the little guy?
9908080	9908880	Little guy?
9908880	9909120	No.
9913200	9915520	Don't worry about trash.
9915520	9918160	Nicocorporatio takes care of everything.
9918160	9919680	They didn't take care of anything.
9920480	9920800	Ruh.
9920800	9931280	Oh.
9931280	9935280	Is there another?
9935280	9947760	I arrest them.
9947760	9949760	What's this?
9949760	9955760	Access to lower level is restricted due to organic life hazards.
9955760	9957760	Please keep out of this area.
9957760	9959360	I closed the elevator.
9959360	9962240	This is the elevator that leads down below, isn't it?
9972800	9975200	Well, yeah, look.
9977360	9979200	I'm right below inside the elevator.
9981120	9981840	It's dumb.
9981840	9982880	It's the town.
9983840	9991360	They're down there.
9991360	9995360	Hee.
9997360	9999360	Do you hear that down below?
9999360	10002160	That ebb, that flow?
10002160	10004160	Is that he haunts me?
10004160	10005360	It haunts me?
10005360	10006560	I don't hear that.
10006560	10008160	I don't hear that.
10008160	10009440	I don't hear that.

10011440	10012240	It haunts me?
10014480	10014960	Probably.
10018160	10020320	Caz buzzed for an only sad.
10020320	10021280	Why is he sad?
10023040	10024160	Won't he sad?
10028080	10029520	Pan a team up for that.
10034640	10039600	That trash, that trash city blast is no joke.
10041120	10044960	EverydayNekoCorp is doing this relentless work on me.
10047440	10048720	Oh, Clementine?
10048720	10050160	Yeah, I used to hang out with her.
10050720	10051840	She wanted to live.
10053520	10055520	She was a breeze and then she flew.
10056400	10057760	She's a wanted person now.
10058560	10059680	I'm too heavy for me.
10061280	10061840	Hear that?
10062480	10064320	That ebb, that flow?
10070560	10072560	I don't hear that.
10086560	10088000	How did I get over here?
10088000	10089280	Oh, what's over there?
10100560	10102640	Did I hear that?
10118800	10121760	It's the transmitter tower over there.
10121760	10123760	That's where I turned on the power.

10665560	10667560	Excuse me?
10673560	10675560	Drilling nothing over here?
10675560	10681560	There's something supposed to be over here?
10686560	10688560	I'm a little confused.
10690560	10692560	There's a bunch of boxes to jump on.
10699560	10703560	Please state your identity as a peacemaker.
10706560	10715560	Co-operate, or we will have to transfer you to jail and reboot you.
10718560	10721560	Please leave me alone. I'm not the one you're looking for.
10724560	10728560	If you're looking for Clement Simon, I'm sure she's hiding in the residence.
10735560	10739560	Midtown, this looks so cool.
10739560	10740560	This is what I mean.
10740560	10744560	This is what I mean by living in a place like this.
10744560	10745560	Looks really cool.
10745560	10746560	Doesn't it?
10748560	10750560	This looks so cool.
10753560	10754560	I.
10754560	10768560	Consider this tomorrow if I replace my arm with another robotic arm.
10768560	10771560	Then the next day my other arm too.
10771560	10776560	Then my body and so on until I replace all my parts and upgrade my software.
10776560	10779560	Will I be the same robot you're talking to now?
10779560	10783560	If you maintain the same memory as I think so.
10784560	10787560	Oh hey, what are you showing me right now?
10788560	10790560	A bunch of people I don't know.
10790560	10795560	My guess is that they probably live in the massive housing building further uptown.
10796560	10798560	Do what you want with that.
10800560	10803560	Thanks, Mr. Bloody.
10806560	10808560	Destruction.
10809560	10812560	Destruction, no.
10814560	10816560	Something else in here.
10817560	10819560	Meow.

10846560	10853560	Hey, I'm off to work. See you later.
10853560	10857560	Okay honey, be cautious of sentinels.
10857560	10862560	They're quite, they're quick to make a rest for no reason, for no good reason.
10862560	10865560	Don't worry about me, babe, I'm good.
10877560	10879560	Hello.
10882560	10884560	Gray.
10884560	10890560	At Nygle Corp, we work all day long together the ways and send it downstairs,
10890560	10893560	where they recycle and repurpose it.
10895560	10901560	Speaking of downstairs, it has been a while since we had news from them.
10902560	10905560	We'll picture that one.
10905560	10908560	Hey, is that an address on the back?
10908560	10914560	First symbol is the street, and then there is a floor and a door number.
10914560	10916560	It's gonna be easy to find.
10916560	10918560	Ready?
10918560	10920560	How do you...
10922560	10924560	Uh, examine.
10925560	10927560	Oh.
10927560	10929560	Oh.
10931560	10933560	They said a...
10933560	10935560	Come on, I can do this.
10935560	10937560	Ha ha.
10937560	10941560	A street, a street door number, and then what?
10941560	10943560	What was it?
10949560	10953560	Whatever that symbol is, three five?
10957560	10959560	Floor.
10962560	10964560	Flo.
10965560	10968560	Sorry, little one, you can't play over here.
10971560	10976560	The Nygle Corp factory is no place for a little fussball idea.
10976560	10982560	Access is restricted, but only for a little while.
10982560	10987560	If you can wait a few years, we'll open right back up.
10987560	10990560	Wait, I didn't show in the picture.
10992560	10995560	Cool picture, is that address on the back?
10995560	10998560	Oh, you're just gonna tell me the same thing.
10999560	11001560	Ha ha.

11077460	11098060	Hi. Clubs closed. Get lost? Oh yeah? Who are you? Police? Everyone's looking for her.
11098060	11103060	I'll let her in if that's what you want to know.
11107060	11109060	Ooh, what's down there?
11112060	11116060	This merchant crook sold me a faulty battery the other day.
11117060	11122060	Now he just prisions not to hear me. Every time I try to confront him.
11122060	11128060	If he wasn't for the Sentinel on patrol he'd end up a spare part.
11134060	11139060	I don't think he has any. I think he needs to be charged.
11146060	11147060	Translate.
11147060	11160060	Code is a 2458 or 8542. 2458 or 8542. Looks like it's backwards.
11163060	11166060	Tiaw, remember that? You guys are smart.
11167060	11173060	Oh wait, it's this. What was it? What was it again?
11173060	11174060	Again?
11185060	11187060	458? Oh.
11187060	11202060	That didn't work. 22548. 22548. Nope, that didn't work.
11203060	11218060	8458. Oh, wait. Not in the dictionary.
11219060	11232060	8452? Oh. 8452. Ha!
11236060	11240060	I can't do no bad. I can't have a cat bad.
11241060	11243060	I am cool.
11253060	11255060	What? I'm a little hippie.
11270060	11272060	I'm a little hippie.
11300060	11305060	Can I go any further up or anything like that?
11330060	11356060	Surgery and then a bunch of robot parts.
11360060	11375060	You've been in the city below? I had a friend there.
11375060	11379060	Fifi. I haven't seen him in ages. Did we see someone named Fifi?
11385060	11387060	Down in the city below?
11390060	11394060	I don't remember seeing anyone named Fifi.
11421060	11427060	I don't remember. I don't remember. Me too.
11431060	11436060	I don't know what the downstairs neighbors are up to.
11436060	11440060	I keep hearing bazaar and hammer noises.
11441060	11443060	Is the doctor?
11450060	11452060	I don't know.
11463060	11466060	I didn't say I could jump on their head.
11466060	11470060	Oh no. I thought that was an option too.
11470060	11472060	That'd be funny.
11476060	11478060	Translate.
11479060	11482060	Announcement.
11483060	11489060	If you're looking for some company to talk about poetry, I live behind the elevator.
11489060	11491060	Bonobot.
11491060	11496060	I went and talked to them.
11508060	11532060	I used to own a bar. It was the coziest place around here until I took a screwdriver in the knee and it's closed now.
11538060	11544060	Even if this guy bums me out, he's my only customer. Try not to scare him away.
11557060	11559060	Big city.
11562060	11566060	Sorry shops closed. I'm waiting for the delivery guys.
11566060	11570060	It seems they're taking their sweet time.
11570060	11578060	What's this picture? Oh I know her. She was one of those people who all obsessed with the outside.
11596060	11598060	I don't know.
11598060	11600060	I don't know.
11606060	11608060	I don't know.
11608060	11610060	Oh.
11623060	11626060	I'm feeling really epi.
11626060	11636060	It's this triniest shop in the meantime where the shopkeeper is pretty grumpy.
11636060	11642060	What a nice looking picture. Is that an address in the back?
11642060	11645060	Yeah I know what the address is.
11651060	11654060	I thought there was a door here.
11656060	11669060	Are you one of those young punks listening to loud music all day? No.
11669060	11674060	Don't touch anything. Don't make any noise. Don't ask for your credit.
11674060	11680060	Whatever. I was going to ask you for anything anyways.
11680060	11682060	Whatever.
11682060	11685060	It's over here.
11712060	11722060	I don't have anything to put in there.
11729060	11731060	What was this?
11735060	11737060	Where am I?
11742060	11746060	It wouldn't let me the option to knock it down then pop up.
11750060	11752060	It's another shop.
11760060	11762060	What's this?
11762060	11764060	Translate.
11765060	11770060	Is it hell with the symptoms along with the outsiders?
11776060	11778060	Chat.
11778060	11780060	Chat.
11784060	11786060	I'm tired.
11790060	11792060	I'm really tired.
11794060	11796060	I'm really tired.
11803060	11805060	I'm so tired.
11816060	11819060	I thought I could finish this.
11820060	11823060	I could finish this in one sitting.
11823060	11825060	But I did not get any sleep.
11826060	11828060	But you could soon.
11831060	11834060	I really need to go to sleep.
11834060	11836060	I gotta go to bed.
11838060	11841060	I have part three. Let's go.
11841060	11847060	Don't ever believe in me again.
11847060	11849060	I can do it.
11850060	11852060	I can do it.
11853060	11856060	Work hard again later.
11863060	11867060	It's so hard. I cannot keep my eyes open.
11867060	11875060	If I had gotten some really good sleep, baby, I could have gone on a little longer.
11875060	11877060	But I haven't.
11877060	11881060	I didn't sleep very good last night.
11884060	11886060	The lady is getting a sleep.
11886060	11890060	I have so much on my mind that was bothering me.
11890060	11893060	How do you save the game?
11893060	11895060	Is there a way to save?
11897060	11901060	I don't know if it gets to a checkpoint or something.
11903060	11906060	Where's the next checkpoint?
11906060	11909060	I can save the game.
11923060	11925060	I can save the game.
11938060	11940060	I can save the game.
11940060	11953060	Is there really nothing over there?
11953060	11955060	Is it here?
11955060	11957060	Or is it here?
11970060	11972060	What's this?
11972060	11974060	It's a jail.
12001060	12006060	I can't believe that.
12010060	12015060	If they threw them in jail, then their battery ran out.
12015060	12018060	It's so horrible.
12030060	12035060	Did the game save when I picked up the badge?
12035060	12037060	I didn't look.
12037060	12040060	I didn't check.
12054060	12057060	How do you check?
12058060	12060060	49 seconds.
12060060	12062060	We're fine.
12070060	12074060	We'll play the rest in the next one.
12074060	12076060	I'm so tired.
12076060	12078060	I'm so sorry, everyone.
12078060	12080060	I'm so exhausted.
12080060	12083060	I just really needed some sleep.
12084060	12087060	It's time for bed.
12094060	12096060	It's a fun game, though.
12096060	12098060	I really like it a lot.
12098060	12101060	It's super fun.

12193060	12195060	Can anyone read my poetry?
12195060	12197060	I can see you today.
12197060	12199060	Well, well.
12199060	12201060	Okay.
12225060	12227060	Ychydig.

12277060	12279060	Ychydig.
12279060	12281060	Ychydig.
12281060	12290180	I went through Helen back to fix my settings to make sure that my sound sounded okay and then
12290180	12303220	my volume was okay. It could be hard, it wasn't too loud, it was too quiet. I finally fixed my audio
12303220	12315780	and I think it's fine. Finally okay now. No strange noises, no buzzing, no nothing like that
12315780	12321460	because none of that should be in it. None of that should be in it. Am I hearing background noises
12321460	12332020	every now and then, but excuse me, that's okay. My god, it's good, it's been great honestly,
12332020	12348900	it's good, yay. I'm happy, almost happy. Oh my goodness. And, and, and guess what, guess what, guess
12348900	12354420	what? Oh my god, guess what? It's going on, never sorry, please don't forget to take your meds. Oh,
12354420	12359860	I have completely forgot about that. Why? Yeah, I'll take my meds, I'll take on the meds right now,
12359860	12360580	right now, right now.
12360740	12382660	I don't think everything's on your stream, but it's good for the time I was here. I'm glad, I'm good.
12383540	12394580	Yes, guess what? Also, also, also, I haven't crashed, I haven't crashed or my internet hasn't
12394580	12413700	went out. This whole stream, is that amazing? I didn't crash, I didn't go out.
12416420	12420740	Yay, we had a really good, really good stream.
12424580	12440180	I love W. Yeah, we had an extreme score. I only think I wish me being very happy. Very happy.
12443780	12450820	I promise I'll sleep. I'll be, I'll be up for a little bit and then I'm gonna just go sleep.
12451540	12459540	I'm so tired. I was up all night because I was so sad. I was so sad last night.
12463060	12467620	I must have, I should have been way more careful.
12469460	12476820	And then I would have probably got monetized much earlier. But I was, I was being naughty.
12476820	12484660	I guess you could say. I was being the stinker. I was the stinker.
12497300	12501620	I was so sad and I was just constantly thinking about it last night.
12502580	12509860	I ended up doing all my, I had an audio setting last night. I was just doing audio.
12510900	12515060	As you know, audio found out why my volume was so messed up.
12516340	12520020	Hawaii sounded so different. I finally figured it out.
12520740	12527700	Set it up and it removed stuff. All my settings I had previously was okay.
12527700	12531620	I couldn't figure out why everything else was messed up.
12533700	12536420	Come to find out that it was just my window settings.
12537540	12545780	My window volume went down for some reason and I fixed that up. That's all fixed up.
12548020	12553460	And it was causing, like everything else was causing ducking and stuff. So
12553460	12560980	if the other girls need help with their audio constantly ducking or peaking,
12561860	12565220	I can help with it since I worked on it all night.
12570020	12571620	It wasn't volume mixer.
12571620	12583780	Cut out with the bleeding hires. Yeah, we could all cut out.
12587060	12590340	No one expects you to marathon streams every day.
12590340	12594420	I like streaming for a long time though. It keeps me very distracted.
12594500	12604260	The world is a terrible place. Streaming is very fun. Very fun, very distracting.
12606580	12610740	And I like being that distraction for other people as well,
12611300	12617380	where you could just come in, relax, get cozy, focus on your voice, and then get some tears.
12625220	12640420	I might do sleepy time stories for videos for you guys instead of live streams.
12641220	12646020	Like just video videos of ASMR slayup.
12646980	12659060	Aw, thank you. That's so sweet. Thank you so much for the $5 tip they had all for fun.
12659060	12669620	Thank you, thank you. Thank you.
12676020	12683620	Mm-mm.
12687700	12689620	Okay, are you with those two?
12690740	12697700	Here, my best distraction. I'm glad. I'm glad I can be that space for you guys.
12698740	12703060	I want to be that safe space. I might not be the extreme
12703780	12708100	lwyd, like the other girls, because I know they can be a little
12709540	12719540	intense. I can always be that nice, relaxing, comfy zone that you can retreat to.
12720260	12726820	If the intensity is too much for you, you can always come to me and mama will take care of you.
12726820	12732980	Mm-hmm. That's taking. No, I won't take it right now.
12756820	12762980	Wow.
12768020	12784980	That's good. I really need to pick up my pain meds, though. My shoulder has been killing me.
12786820	12793780	Oh, thank you.
12798020	12802980	You're just so sweet. Oh, my gosh. You're so sweet. Thank you, Peony,
12803540	12810980	because I still don't know how to pronounce your name correctly. Peony. Peony.
12810980	12820900	Thank you for the $4 tip, Peony. I'm so glad you enjoy my strength.
12821780	12825940	And yes, Black Wolf. Black Wolf, thank you so much for the $4 tip.
12826820	12830900	Every time because I was with Mommy. I'm glad you enjoy it.
12830900	12841860	I'm so sorry, Peony.
12853940	12858180	I have taken my meds if anyone is asking. I'm wondering they have been taken.
12858180	12869140	And when you get your soft voice going, my back just shimmers. That's it.
12869140	12885140	Oh, am I glasses? Yeah. I need to pick those up, too.
12885140	12901140	That's true. I'll call them tomorrow. I promise. Just remind me. I'll do it. I'll call them tomorrow.
12901140	12911140	Mm-hmm. Yeah. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow.
12923700	12928100	I love being here so much just because it's so calm and relaxing. Letters can be too much
12928100	12936020	at times. That's why I like it here. I'm glad I've been kind of beating myself up to be like the other girls.
12937300	12944100	Like, I don't know. I just don't have it in me to be that way when I'm live, you know?
12944740	12952100	I'm a little embarrassed and I get really red with face burns.
12952100	12966100	But being like this is very easy for me. It's natural. It's just who I am. I just be myself when I stream live.
12966100	12976100	It'd be me and then I like it comfy and being as sweet to you guys. But you're so sweet to me.
12976660	12985300	Well, I don't know. As to purposely trying to be loose with them as it's my thing.
12987620	12995540	Especially while live. But doing like recordings and stuff is easy. I can record. I can do that.
12997380	13002100	I don't have too many eyes on me watching me.
13006100	13008100	What?
13022340	13030100	You're doing great. Nothing of yourself about it. So that makes you feel comfy. You know, I enjoy the comfy.
13030100	13040100	Yeah, it's just I've already gotten a few morals wishing that I was more fluid by so many morals.
13040100	13047700	I haven't really sorry. I haven't I've been reading everyone's morals. So many people sent me some really nice things, but
13048500	13058100	I haven't been able to respond to a majority of morals lately because I think I've flooded with quite a few of things that got me a little
13058100	13063860	sad. So I've been avoiding the morals for the time being.
13068100	13075300	But it's perfectly fine. They're not bad. They're not extremely bad. It's just me being the little overthinker that I am.
13076020	13078660	That's all. Nothing extremely bad.
13078660	13088820	Just a lot of morals. Every time I go through like 50 morals, there's like 100 more.
13089620	13095780	I go through like 25 morals and there's another 100 more. I can't. It's so many.
13096260	13103220	And then I have to skip some and I feel bad skipping morals. It's so many morals.
13103220	13107780	It's so many.
13107780	13126740	I
13127140	13134700	Mi'n ddana yn bwysig mae hwnna o'r tîngr o gyfo.
13134980	13154380	Snw'n hefyd yn ystod drosh o
13154380	13157660	I'm glad. I like the way you guys react whenever I hit you with something.
13162940	13169100	The way you guys fall. Have hiccups. The way you guys fall and crumple.
13173020	13175660	Ravel in my feet.
13175660	13177660	I'm glad.
13181340	13183340	Yeah.
13184620	13187900	As long as I'm after a carrot, I am pretty much.
13191340	13193340	You love gremlin also.
13206460	13208460	Mmm. That's fine.
13211020	13217420	There's like many great emails at work. There's so many of them. Yeah. They're hard.
13219820	13225260	You guys, there's one. There's a small amount. I will try. I'll do my absolute best.
13226860	13233100	I just feel so bad because I answered so many morals, but I never used marshmallow before.
13233900	13237580	So I didn't know how to make them public, nor like or
13238300	13243900	send morals before, but now I know and I can try.
13244940	13246940	I'll try again.
13249500	13251500	I'll try again.
13251500	13264460	Mmm. I'll read them out to my own pairs.
13266700	13271820	Your voice is loud enough for me. It's just my normal voice.
13275420	13277420	What a man.
13279100	13281100	Melt from her words.
13282300	13287340	Melt. Melt away. Melt for me.
13291580	13295500	Mwami. Mwai a crumbel anasura saeth anethang.
13300540	13302540	Come on, melt away.
13303340	13307100	You might need a higher person. Just sort your morals.
13308540	13310300	Possibly.
13310300	13316540	But I like going through them. I just feel, I just have this urge not to miss out on anything.
13317500	13322220	And I don't know. Maybe I'll have to think on it.
13325020	13330380	But I'm sure that we are kind of already like, I can like
13332620	13334620	get that figured out regardless.
13336060	13338060	So it'll be fine.
13338860	13343900	I'm sure I can take up any kind of offers
13345180	13347180	that they can help me out with.
13347740	13352060	Manzan and Shrani has done an amazing job thus far with helping me out.
13352700	13356540	I'm a very clumsy person and I think I have like the worst luck in the world.
13357260	13360220	The worst absolutely fucked world luck in the world.
13360700	13363500	And it's been like that for years ever since I was young.
13364380	13366220	I've gotten hurt.
13366220	13368700	Restrained as accidents have been around me.
13369980	13372620	I cause big things to happen on accident.
13374540	13379580	This has been like a thing that has been running on with me for like a long, long, long time.
13380540	13382540	So yeah.
13384300	13387340	All I can do is power through it because I'm used to it.
13387820	13393180	But I feel so bad when other people get involved and then messes with them.
13394060	13395180	As well.
13395180	13397340	If it's just me, it's fine.
13397340	13399980	Yeah, I'll be sad about it, but it is what it is.
13409500	13411500	I know I defy as a puddle.
13412300	13413580	I'll be doing okay.
13413580	13416300	Don't do things that make you uncomfortable.
13416300	13419820	Be comfy and we'll be comfy.
13419820	13420540	I'm comfy.
13421100	13421820	I'm very comfy.
13421820	13424460	Today was a really nice comfy stream today.
13424460	13426380	So I really enjoyed the day.
13426380	13427260	A lot of fun.
13428140	13433580	I'm just very sleepy and I'll be sleeping very soon.
13433580	13437340	Once this medication starts kicking in, I'm definitely going to go head to head.
13444700	13447900	We want to be good boys and girls for you, Mumu.
13447900	13449420	You are good boys.
13449980	13451740	And you are good girls.
13452380	13456540	I'm very proud of you for being here and supporting your Mumu.
13459020	13461180	You're all very brave and very good.
13463820	13465660	Take it at your own pace, Mumu.
13465660	13466220	I will.
13467340	13469340	Are you today or more yet?
13469340	13470060	Just a bit.
13471660	13473020	Well, I'm lucky to find you.
13474540	13475260	That's so sweet.
13475260	13475740	Thank you.
13480220	13483340	I'll be here to support you 100% of the way.
13483900	13484460	Thank you.
13495980	13498940	I can only wish and hope that is the case.
13500140	13501580	I can only hope.
13503260	13506460	I'd rather be kind than mean to gain good luck.
13507260	13513020	If it just means that it's just me getting at fault, then that's fine.
13513660	13516460	But I just don't like when other people get affected.
13517900	13521500	Thank you so much for the $4 tip the iron reaper.
13521500	13522300	Thank you so much.
13522300	13522620	Thank you.
13522620	13523100	Thank you.
13532700	13533820	I love your goddess.
13533820	13534380	That's why.
13534380	13535020	Thank you.
13535020	13536060	Maximum comfort.
13537820	13540380	Will you can get a great sleep tonight?
13540380	13541660	I'm very sure I will.
13542940	13545900	I am going to just sleep tonight.
13546620	13548140	You guys got me this fan.
13548140	13549420	I have a toaster.
13549420	13550620	I've been eating toast.
13550620	13552140	I've been actually eating some food.
13553820	13555580	Though I caved and got pizza,
13556220	13560140	but I have so much more pizza left over and this can last me for a few days.
13561020	13562860	I'll make sure to stretch it out.
13562940	13566380	Even though I ate like four slices and three cheese sticks.
13570300	13570940	That's fine.
13572300	13575340	I guess stretch the rest out for the rest of the days.
13582380	13585100	Can we get a good night kiss before you go?
13585100	13585660	Yeah, sure.
13585660	13586620	I can do that for you.
13588940	13590380	But it will have to be a quick one.
13593660	13594460	There you go.
13596620	13602140	I'm really looking forward to what you have planned for ASMR videos and stuff like that.
13602140	13607500	Most of it's just going to be some of the stuff I already talked about.
13608780	13613260	And I was really, really looking forward to doing the workout ASMRs, but
13614860	13616460	I hope you enjoyed it.
13616460	13618460	I'll see you in the next video.
13622860	13626620	With YouTube being the way it's being right now, I don't think that's a really wise idea.
13627420	13632220	So we'll have to put that on hold for a while until it seems safe to do so.
13633660	13636540	For now, I'll stick to doing regular ASMRs.
13637420	13641740	I'm trying to find some triggers for you guys that I can do,
13641740	13648620	but I'll probably mostly praising and taking in requests of things you want me to say.
13648700	13649820	Because I'll do that then.
13651660	13652300	Request.
13653500	13657260	And some petting and brushing.
13658300	13664060	And I have bubble wrap, plastic licking and tapping.
13664060	13667420	I don't really have much to tap with,
13669740	13672060	but I can do tapping and stuff like that.
13673180	13674220	Oh, and heartbeats.
13674220	13678460	Thank you to heartbeats for you guys.
13682940	13686780	If you're ever feeling bad just remember we are always here for you in our world.
13686780	13687500	Thank you.
13687500	13690220	I'm so happy to have all of you here.
13690940	13693660	My sweet little bleeding hearts.
13694620	13695980	My sweet sweet babies.
13695980	13703020	Thank you all so much for all of your support and my endeavours.
13705020	13707020	Mmm.
13710700	13713900	Hopefully you'll get the monetization soon.
13713900	13717740	Hopefully, but it'll probably take quite some time.
13718460	13722620	So I hope you're all able to wait for me.
13723820	13725100	Wait for me please.
13726940	13731740	Really sorry that I wasn't more prepared.
13734620	13736140	For the monetization.
13736140	13736940	I'm really sorry.
13742460	13744380	I want you to say you're good.
13745740	13749420	I'll feel as long as you request it.
13750140	13751020	I can do that.
13760460	13762380	Heartbeats are one of my favourites.
13762380	13763260	They help me calm.
13763820	13764620	I'm glad.
13766620	13767420	I'll wait.
13767420	13769420	I'll wait for you as long as it takes.
13770140	13770780	Wait.
13770780	13771660	I'm glad.
13771660	13772220	Thank you.
13772860	13773500	I love you.
13776300	13777180	In the meantime.
13785820	13786860	In the meantime.
13786860	13797580	Let us see who we can read for tonight.
13799260	13800380	I believe we can read
13805340	13807340	Mercerys, Mercy Live.
13808380	13809660	Oh, just not.
13811100	13811660	Is she not?
13812300	13813580	I have to refresh the page.
13814700	13816140	So let me, you know.
13817820	13820940	Well, nobody's live.
13821980	13823020	Nobody's live.
13829420	13831020	We can read into Aimee.
13834060	13837420	Aimee from Yumi Plus.
13839500	13841420	From Yumi Plus we'll read into Aimee.
13842060	13845420	This is my first read that isn't within
13846860	13847420	aimee.
13848860	13853260	It's not within aimee alor.
13855180	13857340	I almost forgot my own company's name.
13859100	13860780	Well, I'm really unsleepy.
13872460	13874300	That means you have to stay right?
13874300	13874540	No.
13874540	13875100	No.
13876780	13879660	On those day I have to go get a cleave.
13879660	13885020	I'll be streaming tomorrow some supermarket simulator.
13885580	13886700	And we'll have some more.
13887340	13889340	I'm going to bit my lip just now.
13891340	13894140	We'll have some more cozy time together.
13900940	13901900	I really bit my lip.
13904540	13914140	So, let's read into them.
13914140	13917260	And via Zora, via Zora, via Zora.

13975580	13977180	I was really bad with audio.
