381000	385000	I'm currently watching an elderly dog for a friend.
385000	388000	Oh, I hope the dog is okay though.
388000	394000	I mean, it never reminds me of when I was working with dogs.
394000	399000	There was this really old dog that was like,
399000	402000	obsessed with me.
402000	405000	Will follow me everywhere.
407000	409000	Will leave me alone.

424000	426000	I love them.
427000	430000	I like doggies a lot.
433000	436000	Am I easily scared?
436000	438000	Depends.
440000	441000	Depends.
444000	447000	I think my form of fear of games is,
447000	450000	of like a scary game is like,
450000	453000	the act of being like,
453000	456000	realistically chased.
459000	462000	Sort of like, my biggest fear.
462000	465000	The game that made me like, drool.
465000	467000	When I screamed.
467000	470000	I think it was, um, Alien Isolation.
472000	476000	I don't think anyone's ever gonna give me to play that game.
477000	479000	What?
479000	483000	I don't think anyone's gonna ever give me to play that game.
486000	489000	Not in a million years.
495000	498000	Sorry, I meant to go turn on my light.
501000	504000	I didn't even make it past the tutorial.
504000	507000	I didn't even finish the tutorial.
507000	510000	That's how scared I was of that game.
528000	531000	Less than three?
531000	533000	That's funny.
535000	537000	I love you too.
537000	538000	Love you too.
538000	541000	Thank you so much for the six dollars that we won.
541000	543000	Thank you, thank you.
549000	552000	Have you ever played Resident Evil or Death Space?
552000	554000	I played a little bit of Death Space
554000	557000	and I like the Resident Evil series, so yeah.
561000	564000	Death Space is still kind of scary.
568000	571000	Death Space is kind of very scary.
571000	574000	Resident Evil not so much.
591000	593000	I don't know.
596000	599000	Ah, that big dog. Best toys ever.
602000	604000	I'm very sorry.
604000	607000	My condolences were lost.
607000	610000	My body was a good doggy.
610000	613000	Very good doggy.
622000	624000	Me?
633000	636000	I'm just reading, child.
636000	639000	Sorry.
644000	647000	It's very hot. You're so squishy.
647000	649000	Am I?
649000	652000	Super soft and warm.
652000	654000	Thank you.
667000	670000	I'm not discouraged, don't worry.
670000	675000	It might be disappointing as a whole, but don't worry.
675000	677000	I'll be okay.
678000	680000	Oh.
680000	684000	I just hang on in there and keep on streaming like normal.
684000	687000	I appreciate your concern, though.
687000	689000	A lot.
693000	697000	And I don't think I'm the best out of the Villalor girls.
699000	701000	I don't think I'm the best.
701000	703000	Um.
703000	707000	But I do appreciate that it's very sweet.
707000	711000	Thank you for the $1.00 details, Villalor.
713000	715000	As a Villalor.
729000	732000	I've been talking so much lately.

772000	777000	You know how when you exercise and you work out and your muscles get sore?
779000	788000	I've been talking so much that my, my neck, my actual neck is sore.
789000	791000	It hurts to touch.
794000	797000	I've been using my neck muscles.
801000	806000	So much now that my throat is like sore.
823000	838000	I don't really take any more morning pills or morning medication.
838000	841000	All my medication is always taken at night.
841000	843000	Always at night.
843000	849000	Speaking of which, let me turn off that alarm for today.
849000	852000	Sorry to do that.
853000	855000	Scared me.
872000	875000	I read that wrong.
875000	877000	Sorry.
884000	886000	I'm so glad.

888000	890000	I hope you have a good stream.
890000	891000	Oh, it's nice to you.
891000	893000	Thank you for stopping by.
893000	895000	Appreciate you.

899000	901000	Okay, um,
903000	906000	I bought the hoodie and joggers.
906000	908000	I can't wait for them.
908000	909000	I'm excited.
909000	911000	Well, thank you for buying the merch.
911000	916000	Alright, I hope you enjoy and feel comfy and cozy and dumb.

959000	969000	I hope that you enjoy your time here and the stream and you feel much better as we play.
969000	972000	Thank you so much for $5 to be all for fun.
972000	974000	Thank you, thank you.
980000	990000	Because you said big yawn, I ended up yawning.
990000	992000	I was trying to hold it in.
992000	994000	Look what you did.
998000	1001000	I need to turn this up, so give me one second.
1004000	1007000	Let me turn this up.
1007000	1010000	Alright, can you guys hear me a little better?
1010000	1014000	Is this better or worse?
1014000	1016000	Better or worse?
1019000	1022000	Or can I be a little louder?
1022000	1024000	I think it should be fine.
1024000	1026000	Right here?
1033000	1035000	Oh goodness.
1038000	1049000	Okay, I don't want to make too loud of a noise or something.
1049000	1056000	It's going to be extremely loud because small noises that I make can get really loud.
1056000	1060000	So I just want to be careful about that.
1061000	1063000	More Pog.
1063000	1065000	Pog?
1067000	1069000	Pog.
1073000	1075000	Pog.
1097000	1099000	Ah.
1107000	1109000	Ah.
1109000	1111000	Ah.
1133000	1136000	Are you guys ready to play?
1140000	1143000	I have none, I don't really, I didn't, oh.
1143000	1146000	I mean, I don't want you guys to worry.
1152000	1156000	I don't want to, I didn't want to tell you about this.
1156000	1158000	I didn't want you guys to worry.
1160000	1163000	I sat here and I debated it in my head.
1163000	1165000	Should I tell them?
1169000	1171000	Should I tell them?
1182000	1184000	Okay, okay.
1184000	1187000	Okay, okay, okay.
1187000	1190000	It's not bad, it's really not bad.
1190000	1193000	It's okay, it's fine.
1193000	1201000	I have like a vacuum cleaner and I was cleaning up and the vacuum pinched my finger.
1201000	1203000	It's fine.
1203000	1207000	The swelling went down a little bit.
1210000	1213000	I keep playing with my finger.
1213000	1216000	It's like a little purple on one side.
1216000	1221000	It's like purple on the part that got pinched.
1221000	1223000	Like purple and numb.
1230000	1232000	I have sensitive skin.
1232000	1236000	If I got like tapped, like that area is going to turn purple.
1236000	1242000	It's normal, it's normal, it's normal.
1242000	1245000	Do not be worried, it's fine.
1252000	1254000	I think it's fine.
1254000	1258000	I was just contemplating on whether or not my finger is okay.
1260000	1262000	She's a scared toe.
1262000	1265000	I'm not losing my toe, my toe is fine.
1265000	1269000	And I said I pinched my finger, not my toe.
1277000	1279000	Can I guess the booboo?
1279000	1282000	If she's going to kiss the booboo.
1282000	1284000	Yes, you can kiss the booboo.
1284000	1287000	Yeah, you can kiss the booboo.
1301000	1303000	No, not my precious vacuum.
1303000	1305000	It keeps my floor clean.
1306000	1310000	I might be like, I might have clutter in my room,
1310000	1313000	but I really don't like crumbs.
1313000	1315000	Crumbs annoy me.
1320000	1323000	But I don't hurt my vacuum.
1326000	1332000	I don't like, I really like to keep things tidy in a specific way.
1336000	1341000	I'm sorry, that was my OCD speaking.
1341000	1345000	I had slight panic in my brain about my vacuum being broken,
1345000	1348000	and it made me feel very sad.
1348000	1352000	No, not the vacuum, please.
1352000	1355000	No, no.
1366000	1368000	Mm-hmm.
1376000	1380000	Viking funeral for a vacuum.
1387000	1389000	Wow.
1390000	1392000	Wow.
1395000	1407000	Okay, what is this?
1407000	1410000	Oh, I'm ready when I'm not.
1410000	1412000	I thought I was ready.
1412000	1414000	I'm not ready.
1414000	1417000	I'm not ready, I'm not ready, you know.
1418000	1423000	Booboo.
1428000	1431000	Where does this keep coming from?
1431000	1435000	I always delete this, and it always comes back.
1435000	1438000	That's so strange.
1439000	1441000	Mm-hmm.
1457000	1459000	It's very strange.
1461000	1465000	It's not super scuffed, what do you mean?
1465000	1468000	It's fine, we're not scuffed yet.
1471000	1474000	We're fine, we're fine.
1488000	1491000	I do not have malware issues.
1491000	1496000	I was only deleting a file on OBS that somehow keeps coming back.
1496000	1499000	It won't go away.
1501000	1504000	Leave me alone, go away.
1504000	1509000	I used to one time, leave me alone.
1512000	1515000	We're fine, we're fine.
1515000	1518000	Okay, now I turn this off.

2483440	2497440	Ew.
2497440	2500440	No, I'm scared.
2500440	2507440	I'm so nervous. I don't even know what to say. You don't understand. I'm so scared.
2507440	2512440	I'm so scared.
2512440	2519440	I'm so scared. I'm so nervous. Am I supposed to be back here?
2519440	2522440	Do I have to take out the lighter?
2522440	2539440	That's a wall.
2539440	2561440	No, bring that back. It's dark.
2561440	2581440	Okay, what do I do in here?
2581440	2609440	I'm really not good with puzzles. I don't think there'd be puzzles in here.
2609440	2614440	Can I push that?
2614440	2630440	Yeah, I noticed the handprint on the fridge.
2630440	2643440	Can I grab this? No, I can't grab anything.
2643440	2651440	I thought I had to push this or something, but I can't do that either.
2651440	2680440	I can't climb up here.
2680440	2709440	I think I have to be in this room.
2709440	2738440	Okay, the little thing ran over here.
2738440	2747440	Is it on here? Oh, yes.
2747440	2769440	The nose.
2769440	2773440	I can't take a win me.
2773440	2798440	I can't jump. You just hold the button and hold up.
2798440	2811440	I can't climb.

2924440	2939440	No! It wouldn't let me run. I couldn't run.
2939440	2968440	This way, I think.
2969440	2978440	Climb. Climb. There you go.
2978440	3000440	Uh-oh.
3000440	3029440	I'm not scared of you.
3030440	3040440	I'm not scared of you.
3070440	3099440	I'm so nervous.
3099440	3109440	There's another thingy.
3109440	3112440	What is that on the door?
3112440	3118440	Isn't that eyeball?
3118440	3133440	Is this toilet?
3134440	3148440	Did you see that?
3148440	3177440	I'm not scared of you.
3177440	3187440	I'm not scared of you.
3187440	3207440	I'm not scared of you.
3207440	3232440	I can't reach that. It's too high up.
3233440	3250440	That's a timer.
3250440	3257440	Why is there kids toys?
3257440	3280440	Yeah. That's kind of scary.
3280440	3300440	I'm not scared of you.

3389440	3396440	Are we supposed to come back in here?
3396440	3400440	Do we have to run all the way across the room?
3400440	3427440	Like really fast?
3427440	3433440	Is there anything in the way?
3433440	3462440	I'm not scared of you.
3462440	3473440	This isn't very dangerous.
3473440	3480440	Nah.
3480440	3484440	I don't like that.
3484440	3494440	It's my lucky block.
3494440	3518440	Is it something that can hear me?
3518440	3538440	I can't take the block with me.
3538440	3567440	Can I jump and climb now?
3567440	3574440	Can I go up?
3574440	3582440	I want to help them.
3582440	3591440	I'll climb up.
3591440	3608440	With this?
3608440	3612440	I thought he was trapped.
3612440	3616440	Are they not trapped?
3616440	3628440	What's up here?

4012440	4022440	I'm going to give it to me.
4022440	4032440	Was that bread? Why is it so squelchy?
4032440	4044440	Thank you.
4044440	4058440	What did I eat? Was that bread?
4058440	4064440	My dear mommy, you got this. I've got some free time so I'll watch you.

4068440	4076440	Thank you for the $5 tipi.
4076440	4082440	I hope you'll join me in your free time.
4082440	4100440	It's a noose.
4100440	4120440	It's too shower.
4120440	4134440	There's so many cages.
4134440	4146440	I got to remember that you don't press space when climbing. Do not press space.
4146440	4156440	What was that?

4276440	4296440	What was that?
4296440	4312440	That's a long fall.
4312440	4334440	Is that supposed to be up here?
4334440	4352440	I pressed space by accident.
4352440	4360440	Can I push this? No.

7078440	7084440	She left me something and I can get something.
7084440	7092440	So give me one moment, I want to order something.
7092440	7100440	Give me a moment.

7260440	7288440	Yeah.
7288440	7316440	Yeah.
7316440	7342440	Yeah.
7342440	7368440	Yeah.
7368440	7394440	This heart monitor sucks for people with breasts.
7394440	7420440	Yeah.
7420440	7434440	Okay.
7434440	7436440	I'm doing alright.
7436440	7450440	Let's do it.
7450440	7470440	No.
7480440	7508440	Okay.
7508440	7518440	Okay.
7538440	7566440	Okay.
7566440	7574440	Okay.
7574440	7600440	This is amazing hearing you telling me he didn't hear that.
7600440	7622440	I had to climb up there.
7622440	7642440	I have to go all the way up here.
7652440	7672440	Okay, so how do I go back up?
7672440	7676440	How do I go back up?
7676440	7680440	How do I go up there?
7680440	7684440	Did I trap myself?
7684440	7688440	Was I supposed to have put the thingy in there?
7688440	7704440	Am I trapped?
7704440	7724440	I have to go.
7724440	7728440	I passed it a few times.
7728440	7738440	Yeah.
7738440	7750440	Over here.
7750440	7760440	Yeah.
7760440	7770440	Yeah.
7770440	7786440	Alright.
7786440	7814440	Okay.
7814440	7842440	Can you like leave?
7842440	7854440	Can you leave?
7854440	7856440	Why are you breathing so hard?
7856440	7858440	Why is he breathing so hard?
7858440	7860440	Why is he still in here?
7860440	7864440	Use monkeys?
7864440	7880440	What if he turns around really fast?
7880440	7900440	Okay.
7900440	7922440	Hang on one second.
7930440	7940440	Okay.
7940440	7950440	Okay.
7950440	7960440	Okay.
7960440	7970440	Okay.
7970440	7980440	Okay.
7980440	7990440	Okay.
7990440	8000440	Okay.
8000440	8020440	Okay.
8020440	8036440	Thank you, food came. I have food now.
8036440	8048440	Usually they like call you to let you know they're there, but they didn't call me this morning.
8048440	8066440	They're their phone.
8066440	8084440	I have beef, beef, beef broccoli, and white rice.
8084440	8094440	I haven't had beef in a while.
8094440	8104440	Okay.
8104440	8114440	Okay.
8114440	8126440	I'm so sorry if that hurt anyone's ears.
8126440	8134440	I hit my hand on the microphone really, really hard.
8134440	8144440	Hang on.
8164440	8184440	Okay.
8184440	8204440	Okay.
8204440	8214440	Okay.
8214440	8238440	Okay.
8238440	8266440	Okay.
8266440	8276440	Okay.
8276440	8286440	Okay.
8286440	8306440	Okay.
8306440	8316440	Okay.
8316440	8326440	Okay.
8326440	8336440	Okay.
8336440	8346440	Okay.
8346440	8356440	Okay.
8356440	8384440	Okay.
8384440	8400440	Okay.
8400440	8412440	I mean, like, it's so weird. There's sauce on the broccoli, but I don't taste the sauce. You know what I mean? There's sauce on the broccoli.
8412440	8432440	Am I weird?
8432440	8442440	Okay.
8442440	8454440	Maybe there's like a few pieces of broccoli in here that just don't taste good.
8454440	8474440	It's like a mix.
8474440	8494440	Maybe you're getting sick and losing your sense of taste.
8494440	8510440	I thought I hope not. If I get sick, I get sick for a really long time. I would have to take a few days off if I get really sick. If I get sick to the point I lose sense of taste.
8510440	8526440	I would have to take a few days off once like symptoms start hitting me. My immune system takes a long time to fight stuff off.
8526440	8552440	My immune system takes a long time. So I'd be sick in bed for a really long time. Sleeping. Long stop sleeping. Got a rest.
8552440	8564440	The sauce. The sauce tastes funny. It's like they changed the sauce. Like it tastes different.
8564440	8584440	I like celery too, but imagine eating something and tasting something entirely different. Just because you like that taste of the food that you usually eat doesn't mean you want to taste it in the food that you're eating right now.
8584440	8612440	What you've been is the sauce? I don't even know. Does anyone ever question or know what's in their food when they order it?
8612440	8634440	Really? So you go to a Chinese spot and you go what's in the sauce? What's in the sauce?
8634440	8644440	What is in there?
8644440	8660440	You think they'll really tell you?
8660440	8670440	A secret formula?
8690440	8712440	I want the secret formula.
8712440	8731440	A secret formula.
8731440	8760440	I think I know what it is. It's the combination of the rice and the sauce. Every time I put the rice and the sauce together and I eat it, the taste is very hard to describe.
8760440	8778440	It doesn't taste great when you combine the rice and the sauce. Usually that's never the case. I'm confused why it's so bad right now.
8778440	8800440	But the sauce with the meat and the broccoli is kind of okay, but when you combine the rice, it tastes kind of funny.
8800440	8808440	It tastes a little funny.
8808440	8836440	Yes, white rice, beef and broccoli.
8836440	8849440	Yeah, it's a soda. I only drink the ginger ale. Nope. Ginger ale.
8849440	8871440	Do you guys open your can halfway, not all the way? And then suck on it? I do that. I barely open it. I'm in my suck on it.
8871440	8882440	I do it all the time. It's fun.
8882440	8907440	But if you do that, remember to clean your can, clean the top of your can before you do that. If anyone ever gets curious to do it, wipe the top of your can.
8907440	8922440	No, I don't like this. Sorry, excuse me. I really don't like this.
8937440	8958440	That's a dub. No, thank you.
8958440	8968440	That almost made me barf.
8968440	8982440	Whatever sauce this is, the sauce ruined everything.
8982440	8998440	I have a very sensitive stomach and taste buds. So I trust my gut.
8998440	9009440	If my tongue tells me that this isn't good, I shouldn't eat it.
9009440	9019440	Even my mom, my mom and my sister and all my other siblings trust my taste buds. They used to question it.
9019440	9025440	They used to be like, oh, there's no way that every time you eat something in your tongue says it tastes bad that we shouldn't eat it.
9025440	9036440	I'm like, go ahead, eat it. Then they either get food poisoning or they like throw it up or they get really sick.
9036440	9046440	So whatever. I trust my tongue. I'm not eating that.
9046440	9056440	My body, I tried to swallow it and then my body literally made it come back up. Nope. I'm good. I'm not going to eat it.
9077440	9104440	Some of it that I already swallowed, my stomach is starting to hurt a little bit.
9104440	9123440	Alright, it's fine. It was a burp. We're okay. We're okay. It was a burp. I'm just a tiny bit nauseous. That's all.
9134440	9154440	I can eat this. I can't eat that. This is fine. But every time I eat that, it's not fine. What is that?
9154440	9167440	Yeah, the rice. The rice is just not, it's not hitting me very well. I don't want to eat that. The other stuff is fine.
9167440	9191440	But the rice was wrong with the rice. No, it's not overcooked, I don't think.
9191440	9211440	Probably old rice, maybe. Every time I try to eat the rice, I get really nauseous. It tastes strange. Really strange. I don't like it. I don't like it.
9211440	9232440	It's time for pancakes. I can't have sugar any more today. I already had pancakes earlier. Too much sugar. It's fine if I can eat some of it. It's fine as long as I eat something, right?
9232440	9251440	It should be okay. Yeah.
9251440	9278440	It wasn't burnt. It wasn't burnt. It wasn't a burnt pancake, okay? It was not burnt. It was nice pancake-y, okay? I made the pancake-y and it was good. My camera on my phone makes everything much darker. I don't know why. I can't fix it.
9278440	9305440	The pancake was literally golden with brown edges. It was golden with brown edges. It was golden and had brown edges, but the camera made the edges look black. It's not my fault.
9305440	9332440	It wasn't slimy. It was perfect. You know when you take a bite out of the edge and it goes crunch and then soft? Like the tiny, tiny little piece of the edge is crunch, crunch, crunch. And it's yummy.
9332440	9356440	Just a little toasting. Well, it was fried. It was fried. I did use quite a bit of butter. And someone said that there was garlic on top of it. Why the heck would I put garlic on top of a pancake? It was melted butter. Melted butter.
9362440	9382440	You will feel how there is melted butter.
9392440	9412440	It's like how my grandpa used to make pancakes. Really? It was good. It's a lot of butter. Butter makes the edges really crispy.
9413440	9426440	Edges of pancakes really crispy. It was super nice. It was super soft and really white on the inside. Like puffy, like puffy white.
9427440	9444440	That was a good pancake, I mean. It was just one giant pancake. Someone asked if I dusted in syrup. I didn't. The syrup just like slid off the top all around the side. So it looked like it was like sitting in syrup.
9444440	9452440	But trust it wasn't. It was just a tiny bit of syrup because I can't have too much sugar.
9474440	9494440	The more you tease, the higher the chances of me eating you instead of my pancakes. The choice is yours. Promise.
9504440	9517440	You'd be an honor. My body is ready.
9535440	9555440	Imagine. I could see it. I want to get some art done. I don't want to draw it. I want to see a professional draw it. I want to do it. I want to get a professional draw certain things.
9555440	9570440	I just need to see where, you know, where.
9571440	9577440	Oh.
9577440	9581440	Ha ha ha.
9581440	9596440	I'm excited a little bit of this, but I am nauseous and I have a high sneaking suspicion that this is going to come right back up in like a few minutes.
9596440	9621440	With the off chance that it doesn't, I eat it.
9621440	9623440	Ew.
9651440	9672440	I think this is going to make me sick. Continues eating it.
9672440	9688440	Ew.
9688440	9692440	I don't know what you're talking about.
9692440	9711440	I'm hungry. It's better to eat it and then barf it up and let your body do the talking or eat it and chances you keep it down and then you're full. Bam, you have food in there and then the digest and you're fine.
9711440	9734440	I have nutrition. You have food in there. You don't waste it. No waste food. You don't waste it. You eat some of it.
9734440	9763440	If your body is really hungry and starving it will ignore some of the some of the bad stuff.
9763440	9778440	If it's hungry enough, don't eat it. It will take it. Take what it can get.
9778440	9786440	Yeah, it'll be fine. It's fine.
9787440	9813440	Not to stop drinking this boil milk. Only if you're absolutely starving. But I don't recommend drinking spoiled milk or dairy.
9813440	9819440	I've been drinking spoiled milk before.
9819440	9826440	Those were the days.
9826440	9845440	It was like absolutely nothing. Nothing in the fridge. I remember I hadn't eaten for days. I was so hungry. I was so hungry and my mom was out working so she was like never home and it was just me and my sibling, my younger sibling.
9845440	9865440	And I was like, oh, yeah, I am so hungry. I took the cereal. It was like really stale cereal. I had born me a bowl and the milk was like kind of like chunky.
9865440	9881440	And I sat on the floor, crouched on the floor with my sibling in front of me and we stared at the bowl and I was like, I'll eat it first if it kills me. Don't eat it.
9895440	9919440	I couldn't let my younger sibling eat it and then what if they like perish and then I didn't want to meet my mom's wrath of letting my younger sibling eat the spoiled food.
9925440	9941440	So I ate it. I ate a little bit of it and it made me so sick. I was so sick. Yeah, I saw it was spoiled. I was hungry. Excuse me.
9941440	9969440	I was starving. Yeah, me and my sibling was starving. We were hungry. We were very hungry. I felt like something stuck in my throat. Oh my god.
9971440	9978440	I hear a fine.
9978440	9988440	A yogurt with spoiled milk. That sounds gross.
10009440	10028440	I mean, I know yogurt is made out of that kind of like made out of that but don't you need like a special process to make it like like doesn't it take like a long time to make yogurt.
10028440	10046440	It doesn't like all the bad stuff kind of need to be like filtered out of it. Did your mom do all of that? It's not that hard. I guess so people make their own cheese with spoiled milk so I'm not surprised.
10046440	10055440	It still sounds gross.
10055440	10077440	My long distance family member makes their own cheese with spoiled milk. They make a mozzarella cheese for their pizza.
10077440	10093440	Well, I guess it's not spoiled milk. I guess it's normal milk before it spoils and they just warm it up and then make cheese with the milk. I don't think it's really spoiled though.
10093440	10116440	Mozzarella cheese with mozzarella cheese. Yeah, soon to be spoiled. I mean homemade cheese is how you make cheese instead of having to go all the way out to go buy cheese you can make just make your own cheese.
10116440	10133440	I remember making ice cream in school but you don't use spoiled milk to make ice cream. No more, no more, no more normal milk.
10133440	10144440	I have another minute after that story.
10144440	10156440	I mean you could but why? It would murder you. You know.
10156440	10173440	You know sherbet ice cream? You know I can't eat that. I can't have sherbet ice cream.
10173440	10192440	I will absolutely destroy my stomach beyond what anything else I can eat. I don't know. I think it's the sugar because sherbet ice cream does have a ton of sugar.
10192440	10215440	I think it's the sugar but I cannot have sherbet. I used to eat so much of it. I think I like gained that thing. I used to eat so much sherbet ice cream in the past when I was younger. I used to eat so much of it.
10215440	10236440	And then after a little while like years later all of a sudden every time I ate it I was in excruciating pain. I was in so much pain. It was so bad.
10236440	10249440	And then I would test it. I would I bought another one again. Like not recently but like a few years ago I bought one and I was like I'm gonna test it and only eat a tiny bit. Just two spoonfuls.
10249440	10260440	My stomach. That was it. I couldn't eat it. It's impossible. It's absolutely impossible.
10260440	10272440	Well because my doctor said the only way to find out if I have an actual intolerance the stuff is to eat them. So I was testing it by eating it.
10272440	10283440	My doctor was like well the only way to know is to eat it. And I was like okay. And I ate it. And then I was like.
10283440	10307440	Yeah I actually have the mess around to find out.
10308440	10320440	That was years ago when I had the huge humongous stomach aches. Then I stopped eating it for a couple of years. And then my doctor was like and then I got a new doctor and my doctor was like what can you not eat.
10320440	10333440	And I said sherbet ice cream. It makes my stomach hurt. And I was like are you sure. And I was like well like what if it doesn't hurt now. And I was like I don't know.
10333440	10343440	I haven't eaten it since then because it made my stomach hurt. And I was like well the only way you can know is to eat it. And I was like okay.
10343440	10357440	I guess I'll taste it again. And yes. And I ate it again. I had to do the same thing with cheese and everything else. They made me eat it again.
10357440	10378440	And I went back in and they were like so what can you not eat. And I was like oh yeah for sure sherbet ice cream can't eat that.
10378440	10392440	Was that loud. I was drinking soda. Was that loud. I really thought I turned that off. I guess I didn't. I think I forgot to turn it off.
10409440	10415440	No.
10415440	10425440	No.
10425440	10431440	Help me. Help me.
10431440	10439440	Help me.
10439440	10443440	Help me.
10461440	10475440	Was it realistic that you thought it was real.
10476440	10483440	I can't do this anymore.
10483440	10488440	Help me.
10488440	10490440	I can't take it.
10490440	10494440	Help me.
10494440	10509560	oh shit I drilled oh man
10524440	10550880	yeah yeah yeah would you think you're acting like a zombie
10550880	10580760	I'm a zombie
10580760	10588520	I love you zombie
10610760	10635720	I don't know why I think that you like that I at first I thought the YouTube emotes were
10635720	10640720	a little silly looking but they're growing on me I don't know why they're really growing
10640720	10668720	on me. I think I really like some of these YouTube emotes. I think they're great.
10670720	10698680	So we stop procrastinating. I don't like that one. I don't I don't like that one. No that one I
10698680	10727680	don't like it. So what about this one? No, I don't like that one. I don't like it.
10727680	10734680	The game scared you so far. What do you think? What do you think?
10757680	10786680	I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it.
10786680	10815680	I didn't mean to do that. I pressed the wrong button. I pressed the wrong button. I pressed the wrong button.
10815680	10844680	I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it.
10844680	10859680	I don't like it. I don't like it.
10859680	10883680	I don't like it. I don't like it.
10883680	10912680	I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it.

13389680	13396680	I'm not at all like super like extreme knowledgeable of all the like every single trigger.
13396680	13403680	So I've been looking up some stuff but I don't have the I don't have a lot of stuff to do this.
13403680	13409680	The triggers but eventually I will get them and then I can do all the stuff.
13409680	13420680	I have more triggers for you guys and I was more than just happy to use my voice and my praises and stuff.
13420680	13425680	But since I can't really do all the extra sounds and stuff I got to be careful.
13425680	13430680	So I need a little extra more other other stuff.
13430680	13431680	I can still do praises.
13431680	13433680	I can still do requests.
13433680	13435680	I can still say stuff.
13435680	13441680	But I have to be careful with noises.
13441680	13448680	Scalp scratches.
