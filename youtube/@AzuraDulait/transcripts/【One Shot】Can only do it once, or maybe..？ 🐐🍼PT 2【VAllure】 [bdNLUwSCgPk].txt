today
i'm still a little bit upset though i guess i'm a little still upset
i want to see i want to see violence i want to see fighting i want to see blood murder
you know i want to see that i want to see that it's none of that it's none of that it's not fair
it's not much talking it's actually some action it's pretty pretty actiony right now in the last two episodes yeah
pretty actiony but just not the action that i i was expecting i'll put it that way
it's definitely not what i was expecting it was expecting more a little more than what they gave us
what they provided us
i i like tower of god don't get me wrong i've read the comic the comic is amazing
great comic i do not like the anime anime was trash
the animation amazing but the pacing they ruined it they removed so much plot
that it was unnecessary where's the plot they removed so much they changed stuff to make it fit
and it and it didn't make sense i don't i like the comic it's really good anime it's really bad
no hate towards it it's really good you should read it it's really good
it's not gonna be no season two it got a lot of hate got a lot of hate i'd be surprised if
there was a season two honestly if there is i'm surprised i'd be there's no season
my expectations i've been lowered now
it skips a lot it's the same thing with um what anime was that
that school school of god oh brain come on brain you got this
i can't nope can't think of it
but
the god of high school ha ha hey got it yeah yeah brain yeah
ha ha
and the same goes for the god of high school they changed quite a bit in there too they mushed
a lot of episodes together they they ruined the plot in there as well in the anime comic amazing
i i read up to like there's like i read up to like 600 chapters i i lost track
but it was really good it was really good really good comic it derails a lot sometimes
but hey it's all right but they mushed so much together they mushed so much together
they look mashing and it ruined it for me so i didn't want to watch it plus the opening is really
weird i know a lot of people like idiom i love idiom i don't get me wrong i love idiom i love a lot
i like that want want you know you know
but the the opening does not match the theme of the anime itself it was really weird
combination so i couldn't really get into it like i really like music so like an anime theme music
needs to like really really really like draw me and draw me and take me and
take me take me take me take me you know but it didn't take me it didn't take me at all
then like it didn't like it not one bit it was a good song though it would have been really good for
like a like a like a mecca anime or a or like a half kind of like android-y like futuristic kind of anime
you know it would have been really nice for that like it would have got you really in it like oh it's crazy
i like that i like that i like that so much yeah yeah oh yeah yeah sort of like sci-fi yeah
but uh it wasn't it wasn't like that it didn't fit the theme of the anime at all so i couldn't get into it
you've been watching this house needs a classroom yeah it's good i like it i even like the
second season i think they did a really good job with uh each season i like it it's really good
they really and they don't derail from the plot like even them even the filler episodes are still like
with the plot of the anime itself so yeah it's all funny and they're all fun and games and
ha ha he but it doesn't like you don't lose the story it doesn't become like a random filler
whereas like random the plot still stays the same so it's really good
yeah it's the alien the yellow alien teacher yeah yeah yeah
oh i love trigon um i really do who's one of my favorite one of my favorite
animes in the past i love all the oldies all the oldies i didn't watch the new trigon though
the new one that came out they did a remake or something or something like that i don't know if
it's a remake i just know they did read it and it's sort of sort of like cgi cgi ish i think cgi ish
i haven't watched it yet i heard i saw some clips and stuff and it was really amazing so it's on
my list to watch but i'm really nervous to watch og stuff because you know when you watch like really
old stuff it starts and you watch the remix of it it loses the charm it loses the charm that it
once had and it kind of makes me sad so i'm a little afraid a little afraid to
so you don't have into that into that
i also love the art style of kiju number kiju number haven't uh really watched it yet though
but i've seen also like i really like gathering seasonal anime like my habit is i gather
and then i can pick which ones i've been dying to watch and which ones i really want to watch
based off the trailer and i watch those first i binge like i stay up to date with those and then
i let the others sit in the back and like all i wait for all the episodes and stuff to come out
and then i binge those that's how i watch my anime
so there's some things i haven't watched yet and there's some things i'm sitting on and there's
some things i've been spoiled or like i stopped watching stuff i've been spoiled on and i wait
like a few weeks for my brain to forget and then i'll go back and watch it so yeah
it's okay you're not late there's no lateness here
i love binge watching but sometimes hard to wait it is very hard to wait it's very hard
i have i spoke about the spice and wolf one too i've seen the original i know the whole song of the
original the ending song i have not seen the new one yet
the world
and
yeah i like spice and wolf a lot oh it's quite a lot of anime
i'm surprised like it got to the point where i can no longer remember the anime i've watched
that's how bad it is i've watched too much anime even i can say that i've watched too much anime
way too much way too much that if someone were to ask me to give them a recommendation like on the spot
i wouldn't be able to think of any one anime that i'll only be able to say right away is a really good
starter anime is hunter x hunter that's it and then and then after that i'd probably name some new anime
i'm really bad at recommending anime because i can never remember any any uh
like i my brain likes to be like well what if they don't like old anime if you send them straight
away to old anime they might not watch it because of the art style and i know how new people are to anime
they will not watch something if the art looks stupid if it doesn't look like hd look clean or blah blah
no one will watch it no one will watch it yeah i used to recommend death no but like i said people don't
like the art style new people these new generations they don't like it they don't like the art style
they will not watch it so i stopped recommending it
but hunter x hunter is like really clean with their animation um uh the remake of hunter x hunter
the remake the remake uh and formal alchemist brotherhood yelp is also a good recommendation
but uh i just feel sad recommending full metal alchemist brotherhood only because the original is so good
it's so good because they don't like they give you the emotion emotional attachment to the characters
by doing the side stories by doing the other stuff brotherhood just takes that away to make it shorter
so that you only watch the main plot and the original the original ending
of full metal alchemist isn't canon sadly it isn't canon but apparently brotherhood's ending is canon
so that's that's what makes it sad so it's a little sloppy it's a little messy i like the original i like
feeling attachment to the characters i like feeling how they feel and so it's at work
i hope you guys don't mind us just chilling out for a second
before we play one shot
never watch hunter x hunter you're missing out better get the watch in
missing out get the watch in right after stream though what right after stream not right now
yep spyax family is also a good recommendation but like i said spyax family is still a new anime
technically still a new anime just because of the season 2 does not make it an old anime it is brand new
it is brand new uh so it's you can only recommend anime that are like two years old to people now
because no one's gonna watch the old stuff if it's if the animation's not good
if the animation's not good they're not gonna watch it you know they're gonna be like
ah that's just trash that's trash artwork trash ah that's terrible terrible and then they'll
talk about how dbz is the main one that's amazing well nothing's on there's nothing on dbz
there's nothing on there don't get me wrong i like dbz i watch all of it even super even
super i watch it but that's literally what people say there's nothing on dbz like okay all right
okay i try i even it's it's starting to get sad that i recommend Naruto to people and people are like
like irl gross all because of the old artwork in the original when they were in the when they
were younger because that's why i tell them to watch first when they're younger and animation
when they were younger is it is a memory it's nostalgia all right
so tokyo gu is also a good starter that's true i also recommend that
that's a good starter if you haven't watched any anime tokyo gu tokyo gu uh however
i will say i always forget this i am only gonna say i like tokyo gu season one
i hate the fact that the next season like forces you to read the manga in order for you to be up to date
and i think that's dumb i think this is the dumbest thing any any any anime any show you have a tv show i don't
care what show it is i don't care i don't care i don't care i don't care i don't i don't i don't care
i think it's the dumbest thing that any show could ever do why why why just add it add it in the end
season two that's the whole point of you making it into an anime so i could watch it with my eyeballs
with my eyeballs watch the animation with my eyeballs i want to see moving pictures i want
to see flashing lights i want to see all of it i i don't i don't i don't i don't like the fact that they
they force you to go read the manga and then you can watch season two season one banger banger
why did you choose brad to cover i like brad you know man it's only hair because i like brad
brad don't you like brad
what
they're reanimating original nardo no no no no no no
where did you hear this from no i don't like this no
oh it's only been 15 years come on that's not that long
it's only been 15 years come on it was in the five another five another five years
okay
oh no i feel so

To be there. She didn't need to go anywhere. She put herself in a situation she didn't need to be in.
I guess the only reason why they needed her to go was to give emotion to the antagonist.
The antagonist needed to gain something, a feeling or something. And the only person that can give that to him was Orohime.
I'm trying not to say too much without much spoiling.
He needed a reason. He needed something, some feelings.
Orohime was I guess the only person that can really give that to him.
That's what I have.
I hate when stories kind of like force.
Like it feels so forced.
Like who thinks that? Who goes I'm just gonna go to the enemy. I have no other choice.
And then act surprised when the characters spent like how many seasons saving people
And acting as if the person would never save you.
And then you wish him a goodbye.
Goodbye. Don't worry about me. Don't come for me. I'm sorry. Goodbye.
I also like Grimjall a lot. I guess he'd be my third favorite.
Grimjall Jaggerjack. I like Grimjall.
Yeah, he'd be my third.
How disrespectful he was during a fight. True.
I really just like them delinquents. I don't know.
He's so cute. His little bells and his little tenet.
He won't kill a puppy. He didn't want to kill baby.
It's a new anime of Bleach. I heard it at Remake.
It's not really a remake. It's more like a new season. Like a continuation.
So yeah, it's out now. Actually, I haven't seen it yet though.
I haven't seen it yet.
I don't like cliffhangers when it comes to that show. So I'm waiting.
It's like a new season. How many years? Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Oh, my throat. Oh my gosh.
How many years? It's been a long time.
You thought Bleach ended officially? No, it did not.
Bleach, when Bleach ended, the manga was still ongoing.
The manga never stopped. The manga kept going.
So it did not end.
Sadly, it's because a lot of people in the fanbase pressured the author to make more.
I think he made an interview where he said he didn't want to make more.
But he was pressured to make more.
So the manga kept going.
parameters
Yeah.
I think so.

but i i don't like repetitive things i really don't but i really do like one piece
but the beginning one piece was really good and then i don't know what happened
it just it just started to get worse and worse as time went
i did not read the manga of jujutsu kaisen unfortunately no
i am not up to date with jujutsu kaisen either i watched the movie the movie and then i stopped there
i didn't watch the new season i'm scared i saw spoilers so i like stopped what i stopped
and i don't want to watch anything yet until my brain forgets some things i already forgot a bunch
of things so please don't spoil please i beg please please i already saw saw saw some spoilers
so that's why i haven't watched it
i really like um one piece though a lot
yeah i'll watch it very soon actually so no worries i'll get back to you on that
so
sorry i was reading
i like oh my god that's that's
that's that's that's yep you're right you're right the first season of rising uh rising of
shield hero amazing it was great i loved it it was good i loved season one season two
was all right but the ending was rushed then season three came and it was boring it was boring
it was bad it was bad i don't like season three and i and i and i i haven't even watched it
the rest of it i don't like it i like i even try to come back to watching it again i got like
try it again three episode rule three episode rule watch three episodes and see where it takes
you i watch three episodes i'm like all right this is it season episode the fourth episode
should be something crazy right something yeah i watch episode four what is this what is happening
i'm i don't i don't
try to watch another no i can't do this i don't know what is this i don't want it i don't want it
no i'm okay i'm not gonna watch this i'm not i'm taking this off my list uh uh trash
you gotta finish season two i forced myself to get through season two i forced myself
you want to know how you want to know how i got through season two you want to know how i got
through season two of rise and to hero so whenever i started whenever i started an episode
i would take season one's opening song play it skip the season two opening song
so
that's how that's how i got through it
so
you just couldn't do that for season three it just didn't work that way it was so boring
gaslighting yourself
so the the opening for season one was so good come on
it was so good
one piece favorite character is zoro um i'm um zoro
i think i think that's i think that i don't think i don't think uh i guess zoro and robin robin robin robin
yeah zoro zoro my favorite one piece character ace was
white beard was
and now we have now i'm left with zoro and luffy those are my two favorite characters the main character
and zoro
um almost unprecedented levels of culture from i just watched too much anime
i don't leave home so i just watched too much anime
i've watched quite a lot of anime so much actually
yeah oh my gosh we've been chilling here for an hour
we're gonna be streaming for quite some time
it's already been an hour holy shit
i mean
we haven't even started playing the game i was so worried about the lag
i was so worried about the lag it was so weird
um
do i have a favorite anime or genre you can't ask me that question
i don't i don't have a i don't have a favorite anime i i have a current favorite anime
i don't have an all-time favorite anime i have a bunch of all-time favorite anime
but i can't put them on a wait on a wait and weigh them
like which is better i can't do that i've watched too many i can't do that
least favorite anime my brain probably forgot them so i can't think of them right now
you know how when something was like really bad experience when you were watching it
so your brain blocked it out so your brain just blocks it out
not can't think of one
but i'm on my current favorite right now that is even topping slime at the moment
slime and tsukimichi because tsukimichi is also just talking at the moment
uh they they're doing the same thing as slime
he really doesn't want to fight he's like avoiding fighting by doing other things
and there's too many cliffhangers he was falling for this from the sky for two episodes
i i two episodes he was falling from the sky i don't know
and it was just going to everyone else i don't care about everyone else i want to see him fight
uh what if i want to see him murder die die die kill kill kill you know yeah yeah
so um right now my the anime i'm watching at at the moment that has like really god-tier animation
i think the animation is crazy my eyes are blessed uh seventh prince reincarnate into the seventh prince
um something about focus on non-magic
something about focusing on magic i could pull it up hang on
it's like right here bam right in my face as the seventh prince so i can take my time
perfecting my magical ability you know god-tier animation mcs hellcube
uh
muskwish so adorable i like characters who are absolutely insane
i love that i love revenge i like people who don't care about other people
and people who are absolutely op for no reason
and i like seeing people scared in shock when they belittle someone because of their appearance
i like it i like it a lot like take that you thought he was just a child he thought he was just weak
he's gonna absolutely destroy you
it's good i like it a lot i i say it's a muskwatch for me
i'm also watching remonster it's good for like a like a
you uh board kind of thing and you like just want to chill and watch something that tells a story in a little
in a in a different way so remonster is pretty good the opening was made fun of a lot
but it kind of grows on you as you keep watching
and the opening was really weird the animation of the opening is weird the opening song itself
is pretty amazing it's good the song is good but whoever made the animation for the opening
whoever made the animation is questionable it's questionable
the song is good the anime is good the opening of the animations
strange yeah remonster remonster yeah yeah yeah
it's about goblins
someone got reincarnated as a a monster i think and that's the the rest is you find out by watching it
i can't really say much or everything i'll say about the show is basically a spoiler
go watch it i am
it was always a harem anime though it was always a harem anime i guess what made people
kind of like it more is that the main the emcee doesn't doesn't freak out
like like all the original emcees when they're around a bunch of girls they freak out or they play dumb
or they're scared or they're terrified uh yada yada yada this emcee is not like that at all
he accepts everything with open arms and he's very uh logical and stuff about it
but he's like a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
and i think that's i guess his own appeal to it so it's always been a harem even in the manga so yeah
so if you weren't ready for it yeah
yeah i'm not a big fan of harem either but i like the plot of the story itself of where everything leads
uh it keeps you interested um the i guess you'd call it random fanservice
then it's a big old fanservice
yeah the harem part of the manga was a little too much
i'm not a huge fan of uh harem harem anime but there are just some that are good
only some that are good
and maybe i should start on one shot you guys ready to uh watch one shot
i see some people are still getting the crash or uh the stream end somehow unfortunately
i must be so annoying i really wish i can do something about that
hi hi welcome in everyone
i have i have watched uh some heavy etchy
deers s
that's all i'll say
um i i don't think i could really list anymore
um you ready again
you watch english dubs i'm not a fan of the english uh dubs
heavy but i do watch some anime in english dubs some of my favorite voice actors are in english dubs
but the newer voice actors lately aren't doing it for me they don't get into their role
it sounds like they don't care and i hate that i think that sucks
hey why don't you care you need to care
oh
game didn't even like boot up or anything it just starts that's good that's come scary
all right i'm ready i'm ready to game
let me that move out of the way
i'm still in his way
oh no that's it
it's game time it's been too long talking

oh
it's like emotional damage uh maybe that made me really sad
hmm nothing's fighting i talked to him it's all you're there
so are you going here
hi person
there was a time where our people used to live in these runs
but due to the flooding most of us have moved to the less permanent settlement
flooding a the land has gotten brittle
and glenn used to be in one piece you know
but now it's just a bunch of islands that get smaller and smaller uh
is that it do you still live here sorry though
fish populations near the village are thinning so we fisher folk are making temporary shelter here
makes sense the deeper ruins have been abandoned for a while though
well i do see some kids coming in and out of those i think they actually live there
i hope those kids are safe one core it's fish too
empty jar jar worms bros he i actually used to play with worms when i was a kid
when i was a kid i used to play with worms but well really a mattress
i used to play with worms i was the biggest tomboy when i was uh young

i feel like when you go a different way i feel like i'm missing out
okay i'm sorry i apologize
most of the green moss covering our village has already lost its glow
if it wasn't for the thin strip left on the bowl boundaries of the land people could easily
fall into the ocean without light and water becomes indistinguishable here
wow

i was trapped inside this room and it was really scary but then the messiah saved me
trapped in the room yeah there was that weird stuff in the door you know the floating squares we
see next to the ocean sometimes the stuff you told me to stay away from what it's spread to the ruins now
this isn't good don't worry i didn't touch it i'm not hurt or anything still
if it gets any worse you might have to find somewhere else to live
what is this square stuff exactly
good night thank you for loving fire have a sweet
dreams have a sweet dream have sweet dreams have sweet dreams have sweet and your dreams
bad anything that touches them just sort of gets messed up
whenever you hear people say the world is decaying that's what they meant
obviously you should avoid them too i will anyway uh i can't thank you enough for
rescue my sister savior just call me niko oh gosh would it not be rude to call you by
ma'am huh why would it be i mean i'm just a kid like you guys ah and then
would you like to visit our house niko yes yay let's go
on the road again oh shoot looks like we can't go past this block seriously

i won't be up my head
it's a face it's a face and that's amazing
i have literally never thought of that
we kind of get used to it although debris is after living here for a while
come on our house isn't far from here
so uh welcome to our house didn't they say that we they shouldn't live in here

ooh that's so bright so it's pretty further further further further further further
further further further
the edges are glowing yellow it's a sacred feather
feather feather from the great prophet
oh yeah she's the old lady our daddy so no her feathers her feathers her feather
can glow in the dark she can see in the future
what or something like that she gave me she gave one of her feathers
to father before she died father used to pass this down as a heirloom although
it feels more fitting for you to have it all right are you sure totally sure i think that's
what father would have wanted thank you i have a feather now you know who i'm gonna give it to
oh by the way what happened to son i lent it to someone in the run she says she wants to feel a
son but again but before she oh you must be talking about mice
mice what is this
is our name it's a powerful plant spirit she's to protect the gleam but once the son died
her health rapidly deteriorated oh i'm glad you were able to find her in time

The south is a peninsula inhabited by my rams. They are all standing and for unfortunate spots. You have to move them onto the darker moths.
If you get stuck, ring a bell, and they'll all return to their original positions. Good luck.
Over here.
If you ring the bell, do you move, you do.
Ring the bell.
Ring the bell.
Ring the bell.
Ring the bell.
Ring the bell.
Wait, if I pushed them into the corner, wouldn't I get stuck?
Ring the bell.
Oh no, I get stuck.
Oh no.
Hang on, I got this, I'm smart.
Ring the bell.
Ring the bell.
I'm not smart.
I'm not smart.
Ring the bell.
Ring the bell.
Ring the bell.
Ring the bell.
I'm smart.
Ring the bell.
Thank you.
It was all thanks to you guys believing in me that I could do it.
Thanks everyone.
You've provided a great service for all of Ramkind.
In return, I take this fine ram little things.
You're heading to the city, aren't you?
Been there, done that.
Too cramped, you know?
True.
But it's not like this place, it's getting any bigger.
The rising waters and all.
Maybe the city isn't so bad after all.
You won't be able to take your rams with you.
What are you gonna do with your rams?
Ring the bell.
Ring the bell.
Ring the bell.
I think I have something I'd like to trade.
You'll take wool, right?
What can this wool get me?
Wool?
That'll get you this fine pile of...
I'm not sure what this is actually.
Some sort of fabric dye?
How about a Zura?
Should I?
We need fabric dye?
Should I?
Should I check if it's fabric dye?

It's full of eels.
I mean, eels are edible.
They're definitely edible.
They're about.
But don't they have to be made in a certain way.
It's not just Reese's Puff. No, it is not.
It actually tastes very different.
Wait, no.
It's full of snakes.
That's worse.
You're getting snakes.
Those aren't fish or eels.
It's on here.
Water sample collecting and process.
And progress.
I've been over here.
I haven't been over here.
What's over here?
I like snakes.
Snakes are so cute. Don't eat snakes.
I know people who do.
I can tell you a story about a snake experience.
My auntie used to have a big snake.
They couldn't keep the snake anymore.
So their neighbor.
We can take your snake.
And she gave the snake to them.
And they've had the snake for years.
And she gave them the snake.
And do you know what they do with the snake?
They ate it.
They ate the snake.
They ate the snake.
They ate it.
They ate the snake.
They ate her snake.
She was so upset.
She was so angry.
She was so sad.
It was a really big snake.
This is the research station.
Hello.
Are you Zenhera by Dr. Silver Plant?
No.
Here we are then.
Hello person. Welcome to the research station.
Hello.
Did Dr. Silver Plant send you?
No.
Matazura.
Oh, carry on then.
Oh, not here.
How come you're red instead of green?
Well, more of a purple than red.
But your eyes and stuff are red.
I'm only here to pick up this week's small sample.
I'll return to my station in the city soon.
I see it.
I am in charge of collecting the small samples.
Cool.
Phosphoric trees are now being protected under the new laws.
Please do not harvest them.
I'm not.
Phosphoric trees reduce the blade.
Oh, it's the square.
Monitoring.
Monitoring.
Monitoring.
Monitoring.
Monitoring.
Monitoring.
Monitoring.
Abnormality.
Abnormality.
What is that thing?
An anomaly.
An anomaly.
Oh, anomaly.
Can someone teach me English?
Because I don't know English.
Can someone please teach me English?
Why are words so hard?
Words should not be this hard.
I am not a teacher. I can't teach you.
Become one so that you can't teach me.
Well, yeah, but...
I used to go to speech therapy.
Because I had a hard time saying certain words.
And I have an issue with drawing out my sentences.
Even like I'm doing right now.
And I have a stuttering problem.
So I used to go to speech therapy.
I didn't help.
I saw someone mention themselves about it somewhere.
I think it was in the comments somewhere.
And I relate to that.
Because they didn't help me at all either.
I was in speech therapy for years.
People...
Water collecting... collection project resuming.
Hello, living person.
Hello, I have collected a duplicate water sample.
Would you like it?
My programming says that organic beans need water to survive.
So I shall offer it to you.
Oh sure, take it.

but
if i don't use the lotion
much
i end up really drying up
this is why i'm only allowed to take a shower

start peeling like a lizard
i become a full on lizard
i become a full on lizard

Good night! Night night! Have a good night! Have sweet dreams! Night night!
Is it you? Are you allergic to shower?
No, it's not me. I'm not allergic to shower.
It's like an old friend all the way in the past when I was a kid.
I haven't seen them in a long time. It's been many many many years.
I also knew someone who was allergic to the sun.
I knew someone who was allergic to the sun rays.
They would break out into heavy heavy rash.

so
you gotta so cute look at homework
Ah, what is he? He's running.
Ah, he's home.
I'm holding my niko plushie right now.
I'm squeezing out.
Niko so cute.
Azura had another dream. Did you see this one too?
Yeah.
I was in a big field like the one in my last dream.
And I saw my village.
But I only woke up.
Ah, I don't think this world has anything like that.
I mean, big wheat fields.
The only big plants I've seen here are a bunch of weird trees.
And these balls of moss floating in the water.
Wait, is moss even a plant?
Say, have you seen a wheat field before?
Yes, I have.
A long, long time ago, I used to live in one.
It was massive. It was pretty.
There's a lot of dragonflies everywhere.
Yes.
Oh, really pretty, aren't they?
It is very pretty, especially when the sun's up.
The one around my village goes around for miles.
I have a really bad throat, so I don't know.
Hydrating isn't always gonna help.
So it's okay, don't worry about it.
I will keep hydrating though, so don't you worry.
I have more water right here.
Plants are really tall, sometimes I can't even see through them.
When it's windy out, the wind can make waves in it.
It's like an ocean of food.
Oh wait, there's food in regular oceans too.
Like fish or crabs.
I've never actually been to a real ocean until now, actually.
I've been to the ocean.
Really?
That's really cool, Azura.
I've only seen the ocean on TV before.
I've never thought I'd get to ride on a boat through water.
I can't read.
I never thought I'd get to ride a boat through one.
The water back home doesn't have glowy stuff like how it is here either.
But I guess it's because the world is already so dark.
Are you getting sleepy?
It's okay to fall asleep.
I don't mind you all resting your eyes if you find yourself falling asleep to the stream.
It's okay.
Are you just waking up in the morning?
It's alright. Time to let the differences be.
It's very fun.
You know, I used to be scared of the dark, Azura.
Me too! I used to be terrified of the dark!
I'll tell you, I had some family members who were like big old jerks.
Bullies, really.
They used to lock me in a closet when I was younger.
They'd lock me in a closet and let me out for like 30 minutes to an hour.
And I grew a big fear of the dark ever since then.
They always made fun of me for being scared of the dark as I got older.
But I mean, it's your fault.
It's literally your fault.
I was scared of the dark for a long, long time.
I'm only literally now getting used to it.
And I'm so old.
I'm so old.
I used to sleep with a TV on.
It's the only way I can sleep, either with a fan or some little night lights.
I have like a couple of night lights in my room.
I have a light that turns like rainbow-y colors, like all the colors of the rainbow.
And I have a couple of lights on the other side of my room, too.
So yeah, it's really hard for me to sleep at night, even until this day.
I'm worried so you don't worry about it.
I'm worried.
I'm fine.
There literally is no need.
I don't want anyone to feel worried about me, okay?
Okay?
I'm okay.
It's a little hard to imagine that now.
After spending so much time here.
But not long ago, I couldn't even go to sleep without a lamp.
I still can't.
Me, too.
Really?
Even though you're a god, gods have fears, too.
Goddesses have fears, too.
Yeah, I see it.
Oh, but it's a good thing I got over that fear.
Otherwise, I wouldn't last long here.
And again, I've been carrying around the sun.
That's not too bad.
Thanks, Nico more brave than me.
Also, I don't feel scared at all with you guiding me.
So, thanks for that.
He's so cute.
Oh my god.
Oh my god, did you see a little cat smiley there?
So cute.
Anyway, maybe we should head out now, Zara.
How big fear gods have, gods and goddesses definitely have?
The fear of loneliness, the fear of being alone.
You live basically forever.
And then, all of a sudden, everyone around you is gone.
It's lonely. It's very lonely.
And that's why I have you guys.
We will quail each other's loneliness.
Yeah, yeah.
All right.
It's like a fear.
Everyone's big fear.
And that's why it's easier for a god or a goddess to understand how that one emotion feels to a full extent.
You're not alone. I can relate.
Being the only one left after struggling for so long
Is I'm just a lonely soul. Relatable. I understand how you feel.
Watch your lore. I away hold forever. Never let go. Never let go.
How sweet. I appreciate that.
I found a pen. Sort of. Good. Please write your name here.
Good luck.
I like the little jingle. It's cute. It's very cute. Cute jingle.
Is there anything else I'm supposed to do here? I feel like I'm forgetting something.
What in the world?
It's squares.
It's medication time. I have to take my medication real fast.
We're in a new location.
I want to finish the game.
In another hour, I'll take them.
I'll take them. I'll take the medication.
In another hour.
If I take them now, it'll put me to sleep. I don't want to go to sleep.
I'm fixating now.
In another hour, I'll take them.
Want us to remind you? Sure. You can do that.
I'd appreciate that.
The sun. Hello, Messiah. Welcome to the refuge.
Do you understand what you must do here?
I'm supposed to go inside the tower, right?
I already see the tower, so I guess we must be close to the entrance on the surface.
The surface? Look down, small one.
Oh, we're pretty high up.
I guess I gotta get down a lot of stairs.
I'll find an elevator. Correct.
However, the tower is a sacred place.
Finding the entrance may be easy, but that alone will not be enough.
What do you mean?
Once you reach the surface, I recommend visiting the library for leads.
Alright, thank you.
Off you go then.
I'm afraid this area is off limits for you.
Only the bearer of the sacred kernel is permitted to access the garden.
Sacred kernel? Have a kernel.
Oh, like kernel corn? Have this.
It was left behind by the plant lady in the glen.
This is indeed the kernel.
Then it is your duty to regrow her.
Do you understand what you must do?
Um, yep, good.
We may now pass through to access the garden.
Weee!
I'm about to see it in the planter.
There's no dirt in this pot. Will the seed really grow like this?
Do I need dirt?
I gotta get dirt.
It's the shape of the light bulb.
We gotta get dirt.
I agree. I also, I am, being alone has its ups and downs, whether it is the quiet.
I really like my solitude.
I really do.
That didn't scare me. I wasn't scared once.
That didn't scare me at all.
Come on!
Come on!
Work already!
What was that?
I really do like my solitude.
I like spending time to myself sometimes.
But you really do hate when it's like really, really, really quiet.
You miss the noise that surrounds it and stuff.
I don't hate it when I'm like with someone.
It's more like when being talked to when you're like enjoying your solitude.
You know, like when you're like watching anime and someone starts talking to you.
Doesn't that not bother you?
Come on! Come on!
I'm too busy for this.
Excuse me?
Whoa, you are you?
Oh jeez, I didn't think I was gonna run into.
This is embarrassing.
Er, is there anything I can help you with?
Yes please.
I would like to know how to get to the surface.
Yeah, I was afraid you were gonna say that.
Right now, this elevator is the only way to access the surface.
But yeah, just take a look at it.
It looks like an elevator.
Oh, you're not wrong, but go look at the button panel.
Huh?
There aren't any buttons.
Yup, that's a problem.
There's really a big button here that says ground on it.
You know, cause it takes you to the ground area.
Now it's been ripped out or something.
I tried looking everywhere for it to no avail.
Maybe it exploded?
Do you think we'll have to make a new one?
What?
How?
We'll figure it out.
Do you think we'll be able to make that button?
Well, no pressure kid.
I'll just stick with my original plan for now.
Time to kick the door again.
My foot hurts.
Silly Billy.
Okay.
They always say go left.
Oh.
Well, that's nothing there.
What's the bed?
We don't need that yet.
Oh, there's squares.
There's squares again.
You think you can clear the last two areas tonight?
Yeah.
We're gonna play for a while tonight.
I'm feeling up to it.
You know?
It is a Friday.
So I wanna enjoy a Friday night.
Being a noiseless house disturbs me.
But I can't stand loud noises.
Me too.
Actually, I agree.
Have fun learning.
Last time for me to go to sleep.
I'll have a good night.
Sweet dreams.
Good night.
Night night.
Wow.
This tells me go that way.
This says go down.
Sweet squares.
laboratories  Meghan
because the ground access elevator is broken
so I've been told
the city's infrastructure has been suffering a lot lately
skywalks and stairs breaking off left and right
now the only reliable way of transport of those elevators
until now anyway
milk and sugar
I like both
me too
but not in coffee
I like it in coffee
a lot of it
add a lot of it in coffee
coffee machine
nearly full
you know that's all guy came in here earlier
same the same thing
he asked me if I've seen a button that says ground on it
looked pretty stressed
so I wanted to cheer him up
until I'm not only ground
I've seen today's coffee grounds
I thought she was angry
I would be too
he didn't get it
shh
I see him around a lot
but never seems to have time to get a proper meal
he kind of just rushes in here
drinks a whole pot of coffee
and then rushes by out
yeah
he really like
he really takes his job to the extreme
I mean it's an important job
but nothing is worth
that amount of stress I think
what does he do?
maintenance I believe
something to do with the lights
but I don't know the details
maybe he can ask me later
oh
you're still here
would you
like something?
anything?
I can cook something for you if you want
sorry thank you
I am right here
okay so I can't go anywhere in there
was there like an area I missed or something?
over here
I'm like probably
good evening
well
the time of day doesn't really mean anything now
when the sun's gone
with the sun gone
the night never seems to end
well then
how can you tell?
time
I mean
I have my ways
because she's a giant walking clock
there they are a giant walking clock
there they are
time is precious
please cherish it
I will
they are just
bolted so people
they just bolted so people won't steal them
they're just bolted so people won't steal them
feel free to use them
a tape dispenser
it's bolted to the table
oh my god I can't say the word bolted
why is it so hard?
a stapler
some kind of computer terminal
I am the power room mechanic
do you have an issue to report?
yeah actually
surface axis elevator appears to be broken
there's a button missing then
can you take a look?
leaving this room is not in my programming
I don't know
nah I don't like the music change
all of this button
I don't like this
computer
you're gonna need this soon
take this phone
and expose it to the void
the answer will be revealed when you bring it back again
the computer printed out a strange transparent sheet
still clueless
pick yours
where have my sense of humor gone?
why is that so funny to me?
did I make a weird film?
why is this happening?
because I'm hearing the goddess right now
it shouldn't be so funny but it is
a heavy piece of metal
sat into the wall
I think it might be a door or some kind of a
small screen here though
hello
wow
I've actually never been to the big city before
all these lights
all these people
I guess most of this world's population live here
I'm sorry it's the way he turns a look at me
it's very different from my village
the village is very small
surrounded by huge fields
saw a bit of it
in one of my dreams from a while ago
the tallest building in the world
the tallest buildings in our village
are only two stories tall
what about you Zara?
what do you love?
a city
a city like this?
wow
kind of mad and living in a city
must be exciting
get me out
get me out
get me out
get me out
you wanna be here no more
get me out
help me
help me
kind of scary
the view is nice though
I'm so tired
wait
wait
wait

We got these growing lambs.
But they are a poor substitute for the sun.
This tree has leaves.
Ah yes, true.
Bully is just hard to come by nowadays.
You hardly ever see trees like these in the wild anymore.
And the ones you do see are pretty much all raised artificially by people like me.
Mostly for nostalgia purposes.
It's sweet.
Why is it in a flower pot?
Well, doesn't it look nice?
I guess.
I like to stand in the middle of the wheat fields back in my village.
It goes on for miles.
Ah, I wish I could have seen it.
In our world, meat is usually only grown in small isolated pots.
Or in a flower pot.
There's a phosphor tree.
Oh, like the ones we saw in the Glen.
Where are the leaves?
They're not dead, are they?
Oh, not at all.
Although these trees are common, composed of woody tissue, they are closer to grass.
Anonymy-wise.
So the branches are actually leaves?
Sort of.
What is interesting about these plants is the amount of phosphorus they generate.
Zero before dinner?
Yeah.
I'm an adult!
Phosphor.
That's the glowy stuff, right?
Yup.
Phosphor can store light energy and slowly emit it over time.
Most of the phosphorus from this world still contains energy from before the sun went out.
Without the sun to recharge them though.
Well, let's talk about something else.
Hmm.
A water again is half full.
Built-up plant flippings.
Like this, like this, like this.
Like this, like this.
Like this, like this.

They could have saved it, saved those openings for later on.
They could have saved it.
They didn't have to make so many back to back to back.
Couldn't get into black over.
The power system was a bit weird to understand.
They eventually explained it to you in better detail further into the anime.
But it's meant to confuse you because even to the regular like even to the emcee it was confusing.
So it was like meant to kind of confuse you like what's going on.
Like this is dumb whatever this hierarchy stuff is dumb and it makes you agree with the emcee.
So yeah, it was silly.
But then they eventually explain it properly over time.
Probably don't only plant hard enough to survive naturally outside the glenn.
Personally, I think they're really born look at one of my customers really loves them though.
I think all of the black clovers I'm growing here are for him actually.
And I think of it.
Haven't seen him in a while.
Wonder when he's coming back.
Coming to pick the mom these up.
Hmm, it's a pink flower.
Smoke garden tool.
And the part shaped like an owl.
I get it.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
A hoe?
Is it because it's like a hoe?
So it's like who who?
A hoe?
No, but it's not a hoe.
That's not what you call it.
Garden tool.
Trowel.
I knew that.
I knew that.
I knew that.
Hello there.
You have a lot of plants.
A dune.
All of these myself you see.
Feel free to ask.
Oh, you're a gardener right?
Do you have any dirt for growing plants I mean?
Yup, do you need some?
Yes.
I'm supposed to plant the seeds I find while I plant later.
The pod in the garden doesn't have any soil.
I see.
I know what you're talking about.
Here, take this whole bag.
Thanks Mr. Plant person.
I like your little bowl.
Little bowl around your neck.
Most of the plants in our world tend to grow in the plant.
Even if it's facing the flooding issue.
It's still in better condition than the other two areas.
The barrens is, well, the barrens.
And Refuge City has barely enough ground to stand on.
Let alone grow still.
On a larger scale like this, I mean.
Is that it?
Good luck with the seed now.
Thank you, bye bye.
Our stairs here.
Coffee cups.
I'm too young to drink coffee.
Eh?
The coffee machine.
It's very warm.
Are you really?
What's the library?
I love books.
It looks like fun books.
Dog ear?
Dog ear.
Yeah, I was just testing you.
Just testing you guys.
We're bleeding hearts.
I was just testing you.
Hey there.
Hello.
You the Messiah?
I like your scarf.
Thank you.
Mama made it for me.
Tell her I like her needlework.
I will.
When I see her again.
Well.
Okay.
It's a kitchen.
Oh, it's a fridge.
A sink.
A trash can.
There's just magnets on it.
Maybe they'll come in handy.
I hope nobody will mind us taking them.
I have magnets now.
What's over here?
The door.
Trash can.
Is that it?
Your books?
Who knows that?
I think it's in here.
Looks like I can un-latch this door.
Nice.
Nothing is locked right here.
There's dirt now.
How old is Nico?
About a kitten.
Nico's a kitten.
Nico's quite young.
And cute.
Hello again, Messiah.
Do you need help?
No.
Off you go then.
Off you go.
I'm going.
Nico's a baby.
Nico's a cute little baby.
I hope this helps you grow a little seed.
Seeds in the soil, but it looks a bit dry.
Good thinking, Sarah.
Oh, there should help this seed grow.
Hmm.
The dirt's nice and moist now, but...
What if it dries out?
There's only so much water in this little tube.
I'll hold onto the tube for now.
Just in case.
I'll be giving it dirt and water.
But will that be enough?
I can't wait.
I'm coming to you.
I'm losing so much time.
I probably have 42 minutes of work already.
I hate this.

Am I forgetting something?
And I saw water up here.
Can I, like, take water from there?
Or is it not gonna ask me for it yet?
Am I missing something?
I think I'm missing some sort of information.
I don't know what I'm missing, though.
I think I'm missing something.
I had my fan blowing in my direction this whole time.
I really hope it wasn't loud.
Was it, like, super loud?
I, like, just noticed the fan blowing in this direction.
No?
No? No?
Does anyone hear it?
I turned it down just in case.
I get stuck in games like this a lot. Me, too.
Did you find the computer in the area?
Oh, yeah, that's right! I forgot all about that.
Yeah, I found that. They gave me a film.
I heard nothing. The fan I was talking about was you, obviously, silly.
Oh, yeah, I have to get this. This thing.
It's bolted to the table.
How do I get it off the table?
I think I'm missing something.
I don't know what I'm missing.
I don't know what I'm missing.
I don't know what I'm missing.
I don't know what I'm missing.
I don't know what I'm missing.
I don't know what I'm missing.
I don't know what I'm missing.
I don't know what I'm missing.
I got this. I can figure it out.
I'm smart. I'm smart.
I got this. I'll figure it out.
I'll figure it out.
We'll grab a hand first, and we'll see.
Still clueless.
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, clueless.
Yeah, clueless.
Yeah, clueless.
I'm so real clueless.
We'll see.
Thank you.
I mean, figures.
We have to do it like that.
Well, no, Jim, yes.
There is void beyond the four walls.
The binder world to yours.
The edges of your viewport.
Where everything is obscure.
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.
Pass the film through the void, and back again.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
The screen?
Oh, the screen?
I remember this part. It's so funny.
Oh, sorry.
Okay.
I...
I...
What am I doing with this?
Pass it through the void.
And then back again.
How do you pass this through the void?
Back again.
Through the void.
Back again.
What?
I don't get it.
It's windowed currently, yeah?
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
I feel that I'm still an accident.
That's what they mean by the void.
That's so stupid.
That's so stupid.
I can't believe I forgot.
I don't remember any of this.
I played this game so long ago.
Memory lane.
That's so dull.
I'm not going to tell a single soul what I did.
When one day you play the game yourself,
when one day you play the game yourself,
it'll be stuck like me.
It'll be stuck like me.
It'll be stuck like me.
It'll be stuck like me.
It'll be stuck like me.
Like me.
It'll get stuck.
It'll get stuck.
It'll get stuck.
Let me see.
Where do you put the code?
Was it up here?
Was it up here?
I don't know.
What was the code for?
Was it a code again? Do you guys remember?
Do you guys remember the code?
I need you guys to help me remember the code.
My little bleeding hearts help me.
Hi, Zara.
Start to watch your videos and make me happy and comfy.
I hope you do it.
Do it well in the future.
Thank you. Appreciate you for stopping by.
I'm glad you find my videos nice and cozy.
I hope you will continue to find them nice and cozy.
Thank you.
Look at it again.

Stabler.
Do I need a stabler?
I'm so confused. What now?
What now?
Uh oh, I'm yelling.
Was there a place that needed a lock?
That had a lock on it?
Do you guys remember a place like that?
But a lock on it?
That needed a passcode or something?
Don't be afraid to ask if you are hungry.
I want to make you something.
I don't remember seeing anything that a lock on it.
I don't know.
This is the bed, right?
Yeah.
I don't need bed right now.
I'm in bed.
A game like this?
I hate how I'm going to use my head,
but it's so satisfying to be.
Yeah, I agree.
I also hate using my head.
Did I miss something in here?

I'm still monitoring you.
Alert level has been set to low.
Don't worry.
Bronze will be a good cast.
But...
But what am I supposed to do here?
Where can I stick the magnets onto?
And what do I do with the codes?
Like, what am I missing?
I just got back from dinner.
I hope what did you eat yet?
I took my meds, don't worry.
You guys reminded me.
Taco burger is what?
That sounds amazing.
I really need to find a way to get to the library.
On the surface.
Or the library on the surface.
Oh, what?
How do you get it to fit?
This man said something about magnets.
But I don't see a way of these fitting into the panel by themselves.
The only thing that I can think of is the tape.
But I walked up to the tape.
I clicked on the tape.
But nothing happened.
I'll take this one there.
I'll take this one there.
Yeah, see you.
And the only hint I have is this table.
I mean this tape.
Like, what do you do with this tape?
What do you do with this tape?
Feel free to use though.
Can I, like, take some?
Give me tape.
There's no way to use this tape.
I don't know.

Give me a hand, please.
Please help.
Help, help.
Chad, help me please.
Please, please.
Give me a little hand.
I'm missing an item.
Look at that.
Is it not the tape?
How do I get this item?
There's something to do with the codes.

Don't you like to play run away from the killer robot?
Well, at least I have fun with it.
Yeah.

You have such a long dialogue.

so i get the near the stomach before it enters the stomach it's extremely swollen
i really badly swollen but it's it's it was getting better since the last time they checked
so i am
it's getting better
they said my doctor did it endoscopy and they were like uh it's probably swollen because of
i had too much stomach acid in my stomach uh so they had me on a bunch of medication to reduce
the stomach acid to get rid of the ulcers i also had erosion like there was like big black
blotches in my stomach that was like eroding my stomach walls were eroding
they were like it's probably because of uh either medication you are taking or the stomach acid
so they had me on medication for that
yeah so yeah so they was like uh i had me a bunch of medication i was sleeping i remember
i used to sleep for like more than 13 hours because all of medication they gave me they told me
every single last one makes me tired so i would sound like absolutely wasted like

rest to get better mama oh well oh well don't worry we're having a good time here
where are they at
how many medications have you been on in your long life as a goddess
well i mean so they found this mass in my nose they told me it wasn't the c word
i said it wasn't that um which is thank goodness but um i had this
thing in my nose for a long time for about seven years and my doctors kept telling me i was fine
it's nothing to worry about all you're fine oh it's probably just a headache
i was probably just stressed i was probably just this probably just that like there's nothing
wrong with you you're fine so for seven whole years seven the nine years they kept dismissing me
sending me home so uh yeah um i one day i was working i was working at a job and i got hit with
like this is after they were already trying to fire me because i had a doctor's appointment
every week i had to see a therapist every week because i had just got out of the hospital
i just i got out of the hospital so i had to see a doctor every week and um it was mandatory and uh
uh uh um in order to get my medication i had to see the therapist therapist wouldn't prescribe
me anything unless i talked to them directly so it was mandatory that i went to these doctors
appointments and it was mandatory that i went to see my therapist i'm on and my psychiatrist
however um my the place i was working at did not like this even though i told them
before they hired me i set it on my application that i cannot work on this day which is
what would be old monday monday monday mondays i'm i'm i'm i cannot uh do anything on mondays
and tuesdays because i added tuesday because i have other doctors appointments that
layer on top of monday doctor appointments so now it's monday and tuesdays where you most likely
won't see me which is why i don't stream on mondays and tuesdays last week or this week was a exception
so yeah
it took them my job did not like the fact that i worked those days uh that i had to
go to my doctor's appointments those days so they uh they let me go and then they asked me
if i wanted to continue um if i wanted to continue working the next few days with them
and i said yeah and lo and behold at two days before my last day i got sick like it wasn't
like a normal sick
it wasn't like a normal sick i got a headache was i um
was a really really really bad headache my throat my throat is really
all right my throat is fine i'm fine
i think i just need to take pain pain meds real fast uh the other ones
these i take only when i'm feeling a certain pain
i think these i'll be fine i'll be okay all right don't worry don't worry don't worry
wow i got like an excruciating headache while i was working um this job
and it wouldn't go away i had taken um
i had taken some like painkillers for the headache and the headache didn't go away
i was so confused and it just persisted and got worse and worse and worse i'm like this is
the same headache i had like six years ago like this is the headache this is the pain
that i felt in my face that would not go away um and then it like just suddenly went away like a little later
uh and i'm like whatever so
and like no this this is not it this is this something wrong this one very very wrong
and the pain just traveled like in between the crease of your eye you know the nose the bridge of your nose
and that's where the pain was the bridge of my nose in between my eyebrows
um yeah
and it just it was like vibrating throughout my whole head
like starting from the front of my face
it was like that it was like wouldn't stop suddenly every light in my vicinity every bright light
i couldn't open my eyes if i opened my eyes the headache got worse it was so
bad i had to go home had to go home i do not remember if they called the hospital or not
my uh my uh my mom wasn't very um mom in back then she didn't mom back then um when i was working
she didn't want to come get me she had a car at the time and she didn't want to come get me
because she was sleeping and i was working late night it was like
uh 10 in the morning not 10 in the morning sorry 10 at night or something like that
she didn't want to come get me and i worked that late night shift and i was very far away
from home so i had to pay like 160 something dollars no i'm reading that it was this it was
70 something dollars for a cab to take me home because i couldn't
kind of ride it on train or bus or anywhere i can take public transportation
so i ended up going home
and then i went home and then i just remember being in excruciating pain and i couldn't come
into work for the next two days because i wasn't just i don't i can't remember it was really bad
it was so bad that my brain is literally blocking out a majority of my memory
but it was really bad and then i had to go to the er and the er did a
um they wouldn't like uh they wouldn't like really check me out as it was an emergency
they wouldn't check me out i went to the er and they were like well since it's like
your head and stuff we don't have the equipment to test you for anything
we don't have any we can't help you
so i was there for like six hours and they had me sitting in a chair and they refused to see me
uh and then i remember them giving me pain meds and a referral to go see a professional in that
record and i had to wait
no they didn't give me pain meds it was after they gave me pain meds after
it was after the second trip to the er because i had to go a second time
because the pain got even worse it was it was the second trip i went to the er
wait after uh so i they referred me to a professional and i had to wait to see the i had to wait
three months to see the professional and and while waiting in between that time while waiting
i had to go back to the er because i was in too much pain i couldn't sleep i went like days without
sleep i was in so much pain to the point where i would pass out just to sleep i'd pass out i would
cry i was crying i remember crying crying and crying and wanting it to just end
i wow what's that crying i just wanted it over i wanted it to end it was like the worst pain ever
i don't think i'll ever experience pain like that ever again and i never want to go through that again
am i better now yes don't worry i'm better now
what's better now it was just the whole process of all of it and then missing that appointment
after three months and then running out of pain meds i ran out of pain meds
after the three months and then i had to i had to wait another three months
because they didn't want to schedule me any earlier
another three months and then the er never gave me another refill for the pain meds so it was in pain again
and then for the whole three months and then i finally saw the doctor and he gave me medication and
i remember my face swelling like a balloon it was so big my face was massive my head was huge
i felt like my eyeballs was gonna pop out of my my fucking head
oh gosh i was just remembering it as alice as so much
it was it was horrible
and then the doctor treated me well he found out i had chronic severe chronic sinusitis
i had lymph like what do you call them the lymph nodes or something and some other stuff
all up in there i had like everything all of the above it was where i had tissue infected tissue
that spread near close to my brain and they said if it was left untreated for another like
year or so and more that it probably would have spread to my spine and then maybe eventually
became the bigsy so
so that mass that i found um they found in my nose wasn't even found during that appointment
during that entire timespan the mass that was found in my nose was at a place and no other doctors
have heard about they kept sending me to a different place that took x-rays and they were like
oh we found a mass in your nose why not probably not that big of a problem and then they gave me
like a cd scan or the cat scan or whatever you want to call it they gave me it i remember sleeping
in this machine i had to sit in this machine for three hours while they were scanning my face
and they uh they didn't find they didn't find anything else just the mass and then uh i went to
the doctor and told him about it and then they were like from where did you go and i was like this
place and they're like never heard of it so i had to do it all again at a different place
and that took two years to do two whole years
um you know there's so much and i hope you know how to go through this ad again
me too me too not fine though now um then i had my first ever surgery
they scheduled me for surgery last year last year february last year february
so i have been fine for the past year uh just i was healing a lot uh afterwards there was a lot of
a lot of bleeding i couldn't blow my nose i had to be careful with sneezing
because if i sneezed it was just red everywhere red red
i had to be careful with holding my head down or it would just leak red everywhere red
so i had to lay in bed because i was on like heavy medication i just woke up from anesthesia
and i was just like laying there like uh
i was so nervous i waited so long to get the surgery because they they said they'll wait
because they knew i was really scared because he did um the doctor did warn me that it was very
close to my brain um that there could be chance that if they were to mess with anything like
hit anything that it could affect my personality my emotions and something else and i remember
and then they were like then the other doctor i know it's like procedure and i have to tell you
that you could possibly you know perish
but the way he said it to me scared the living
let me shut out of me okay and that's why i waited he scared me so much
he was like and death and he gave me a look like
oh
no we didn't finish the game we're just trying it up we're gonna play the game next week next
week on stay that's likely
so i was on a bunch of medication for that whole timespan i was on like
so much pain meds antibiotics uh stuff for my stomach i was on uh like
some some other stuff i don't remember what for so i was on that and then i was on it for
uh the headaches because this is before they found out about my spine and my shoulder
this is before that so i had that and i was on i i i messed up my knees
i had all accident so my knees are messed up
i only have physical things wrong with me it's not that bad i know people got it worse so
i just went through some really messed up experiences all of these things could have
been caught and fixed if the doctors weren't so dismissive of me uh and actually believed me
one doctor told me that it was all in my head another doctor told me that uh that i was only
coming in for the pain medication they were saying that i was an addict uh another doc another
doctor turned me away uh because i came too much too frequently uh because i was in pain
um i also had uh the uh i had an ovarian ovarian ovarian cyst on my left ovary that burst
i had to call 911 for that one i couldn't walk i couldn't move i couldn't do anything
and 911 came and picked me up
um uh it did a little
i felt it and heard it uh when it did uh when it popped i was taking a massive
a mash of shit on the toilet
i was i was constipated i was taking a massive
massive poop and i strained too hard and all i felt and heard was and i was like ah what was that
that was weird and then the pain gradually got worse and i'm like ah
and i was like dragging myself on the floor like
when my pants down half down
i was calling out to my mom
wait did you wipe first nothing came out i was straining i said i was constipated nothing came out
i was taking the poop
then they took a like a like a uh ultrasound of the cyst and it was the size of a tennis ball
it was massive it was huge it was like a massive cyst on my on my left ovary it was massive
and just like a little bit of it like popped so i was bleeding only inside
so i was a well tennis ball
they were worried they they had to monitor me i was in the hospital for two days that day
they had to monitor me to make sure i didn't like you know bleed out eternally
and uh since i'm also like anemic slightly on the borderline uh the more blood i lost
it was cold and i was very tired so i had to uh they had to be careful
um so they wanted to watch me and monitor me they took so much blood for me
that's how they had to monitor me they took so much
it was a lot
yeah i got to break uh i'm uh i've been through quite a lot over the past couple of years
so that's all right though it's what made me me makes me me makes me who i am
i suppose pray i'm just very accepting i guess
and i have many other stories but we could save those for the other side
right now this is just my some of my medical stories
so i'm just glad i'm off quite a couple of the meds now i'm not on a lot of them
so i'm happy now right i am and i only hope for better things i didn't have a lot of support
as i was getting older i had to do everything myself so i guess you could say i matured way too early
for my for the age that i was when i was younger i had to do everything myself
i had to teach myself many things that many young young girls should definitely have already
been taught i had to teach it to myself so yeah
wait some yeah because there is a lot of girls that aren't taught these things i mean as in some as in
like the glass half full kind of thing i mean there are some girls out there that don't know
currently that they're they were like me there's a lot that do know right now i mean some as in
there are some girls out there who still right now at this moment still aren't taught about hygiene
as they should be taught even now
uh i've been there a bit i've had my extreme extreme downs extreme downs my therapist was four
we don't talk about those those are not what i'm gonna cover anytime soon maybe like
like years later down the line
but i also had my ups so i was satisfied i found some people who support me
and my endeavors so i'm very happy um and a lot of family issues i've had
has been sorted out so yeah i just need to to eventually find a place of my own so i can
do my own thing yeah let's go do my own thing yeah i wanted my own thing
and i want to pursue this v-tubing thing that i'm doing right now um quite some time
it's my uh main source of of living
i hope you all understand
i am totally understandable i understand
thank you i'm glad
i know it's less important but i feel like we aren't uh we aren't taught proper hygiene either
and i think guys aren't taught proper hygiene either as well
i know one thing for for sure is that there are guys who actually truly believe that you don't wipe
that you don't need to wipe the the pepe the pepe
uh but uh the the the pepe there's there's there's there's actually guys out there who
aren't taught that or don't know or other guys taught them not to do it so it's not their fault
really but there are guys who teach other guys that i have been around quite a few of them
um in the past long long time ago don't talk to them anymore though because they were um
they're rude they're rude people
but if you are a guy that don't know about wiping you do wipe you do you do a tap tap
you could take just one or two squares and do a tap tap you tap it up tap it up tap it up tap
up tap up the tip tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap and wipe
there's nothing too extremely it's like yes a lot of people might find it gross but it is what it is
so don't judge too harshly understand their situations or circumstances that they probably
weren't taught
it's okay
and i understand the little jokies that are made where you know
oh yeah people just helicopter it up
this is not a joke this is not the sacred ritual i wouldn't know
it requires a lot of rhythm
i'm working them hips huh we're working them hips
it's not just the way but leaving the washroom and not washing hands
please please wash your hands please wash your hands i know there are guys who don't
who don't even need to use hands hands free but still wash your hands wash them wash
your hands you touch the door knobs you touch the doors you had to come into there
you had to leave you had to touch things wash your hands it is gross that is gross wash your hands
all right as long as you wash your hands
someone's gonna run for it boys
hahaha
bring it around town bring it around town
tell me someone stays in there i'll shake it out
do you wash your hands it's good good good don't worry it's not just boys
i know girls that do the same thing a lot of boys don't know this but there are girls
that literally don't even like they don't clean up after themselves trust trust
don't think just because a lot of girls bathrooms are like super spotless sometimes
and has like pretty plants and stuff but those bathrooms are disgusting
you see things that you don't want to see don't want to see things left unflushed
ვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვვ�

We do not harshly judge them as they're probably, like I said, not taught, not taught, didn't learn, learned the hard way, self-taught, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
I knew of girls that didn't even know about shaving at all, like overall.
And it becomes very unhygienic not to shave or trim because if hairs get really long, too long, you can accumulate bacteria and stuff.
And women are very susceptible to UTIs, it's easier for women to get them the most.
So we gotta take cleanly, like so you take care of your little beddies, take care of your little beddies.
It's called a urinary tract infection, you get an infection in the, in your bladder basically, or in the, your, your, your itta.
Yeah, guys can get it too, but you guys get less, less chance of them getting it because you know, you guys have a longer ways to getting to the bladder unlike women.
Got shorter, shorter ways of getting there, so bacteria can travel faster, easier for women than for men.
Is that like guineastones? No.
But I think the pain could be similar, the pain could be similar.
Oh my god, I'm not gonna read that.
Yeah, so hygiene is very important, so make sure you take care of yourself.
Yeah, I think you have a fire, we'll take care of it, stay clean in that regard, and you won't have to worry, at least you don't have your, your parents telling you it's gonna fall off.
I heard that's what a lot of, a lot of boys got told when they were younger that it was gonna fall off as they don't take care of it.
Yeah.
And even as a student.
My grandma says that.
