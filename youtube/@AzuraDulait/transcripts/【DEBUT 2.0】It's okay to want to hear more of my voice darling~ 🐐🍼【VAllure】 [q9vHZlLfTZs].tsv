243000	245000	I'm so happy, I'm glad
247000	249000	I made a mistake
249000	252000	It was like a big mistake last time
252000	254000	I'm so sorry
255000	258000	I swear to you, I was checking
258000	260000	All my audio
260000	263000	I was checking my audio yesterday before that
263000	265000	The day before that
265000	267000	And just before I went live
269000	271000	And then all of a sudden
271000	273000	It was bad, it was so bad
273000	275000	I was so loud
275000	277000	Beating in your ear
281000	283000	I'm so happy, it sounds so much better
283000	285000	Music is loud, my queen
285000	287000	What? I just turned it down
287000	289000	Okay, I got you, I'll turn it down some more
290000	292000	Cheers
292000	294000	Is that good?
294000	296000	Is it better?
296000	298000	I pray
304000	306000	Power of God
306000	308000	Good, good
308000	310000	And
317000	320000	I know it's impossible to stream without scuff
320000	322000	It happens, it comes
322000	324000	It comes and it goes
324000	326000	You have another choice
326000	328000	What to do?
328000	330000	Get through it
330000	332000	It's like the voice
332000	334000	I'm mercy
334000	336000	I'm mercy
336000	338000	I'm chibi
338000	340000	I'm mercy chibi
350000	352000	I'm so like
352000	354000	My throat is so dry
354000	356000	I feel sick
361000	363000	It's cold
375000	377000	It's nice and cold
377000	379000	Much better
379000	381000	My throat is almost better
384000	387000	Yeah, I'm hydrating with milk
387000	389000	Nice fresh milk
390000	392000	Yeah
405000	407000	I wouldn't be surprised
407000	410000	if there are some of you already falling asleep
411000	413000	If you find my voice super
415000	417000	You know
418000	420000	Relaxing to that point
420000	422000	of falling asleep
422000	423000	I understand
423000	424000	Come closer to the mic
424000	427000	Actually, I think I'll turn it up a little bit
427000	429000	Cause I did turn it down
429000	431000	quite a bit
431000	433000	So scared that I'd be too loud
434000	437000	Hang on, whoop, I made a mistake
448000	450000	Uh
451000	453000	Is this better?
453000	455000	Let me know
460000	462000	Is this good?
462000	464000	Can you hear me?
471000	473000	Sounds good
473000	475000	Yes
475000	477000	Good audio?
477000	479000	Sounds good
479000	481000	Better
483000	485000	I heard solution
488000	490000	Silly
497000	499000	I love this
499000	501000	There we go
502000	504000	What, alright
504000	506000	We'll get this down
506000	508000	We'll get this down
508000	511000	Trust, we'll get this down
511000	514000	And we won't have to worry about this cup anymore
519000	521000	Well
521000	523000	Here's eventually
525000	527000	Are you nervous?
527000	529000	Me?
529000	531000	Maybe
531000	533000	Maybe
533000	535000	Maybe a little bit
537000	539000	Maybe a little bit
539000	541000	I'm a little nervous
551000	553000	I'm a big brave
553000	555000	I'm a big brave woman, alright
555000	558000	A lot of big brave women
571000	573000	Alright, okay
574000	577000	I was just setting everything up
577000	580000	And I thought we'd just, you know, relax
580000	583000	And chill and talk about
584000	587000	The day veiled in some of my interests
587000	589000	And stuff that
589000	591000	I went over
591000	594000	I didn't really get to list everything
594000	596000	That I had on there
596000	599000	Sadly, because I thought that
599000	602000	It would just be better just to list like ten things
602000	604000	Five things
604000	607000	And not like crowded with so much stuff
608000	610000	So
613000	615000	I had
615000	617000	Just a few things
617000	620000	And I do want to go over some of the entrusts
620000	623000	Especially anime choices
623000	626000	And some really big game choices
626000	629000	And stuff, and some more stuff I want to talk about
629000	633000	So if you guys have any questions for me
633000	636000	I'll be happy to
637000	640000	Go over some questions that you have for me
640000	643000	I also want to go over some morals
643000	646000	And talk about
646000	649000	Some things that just came out
649000	651000	Today
651000	653000	Yay
658000	661000	Blessed with the legendary voice
661000	666000	I heard a lot of people tell me that
666000	668000	She can't keep up that voice
668000	670000	It's impossible
670000	673000	I want to say that this is
673000	676000	This is actually my voice
676000	678000	So I don't know
678000	681000	I have quite a range
683000	685000	In my voice
685000	688000	So I can change the voice
688000	692000	But this is my natural voice
697000	699000	So yeah
700000	702000	Can you do impressions too?
705000	709000	There is one impression that I think I can't do
709000	711000	But I don't want to
711000	713000	Because I don't have confidence in it
713000	716000	But I used to do a really good Cartman voice
716000	718000	For self perk
727000	729000	I can't hear it
733000	735000	I'm like so nervous
735000	737000	I'm kind of messing up with a bunch of it
737000	739000	I'm so scared
742000	744000	It's that
744000	746000	It's the Cartman voice
746000	748000	It's the Cartman voice
748000	750000	It's the Cartman voice
750000	752000	It's the Cartman voice
752000	754000	It's the Cartman voice
754000	755000	It's that
755000	757000	It's the Cartman voice
757000	760000	And the goofy voice that I can do
760000	763000	It's like the only impressions that I ever did
763000	766000	When I get really excited or bored
766000	769000	Or having fun or playing games and stuff
769000	772000	I'll probably do them randomly out of the blue
772000	774000	It's like a... how do you call it?
774000	777000	Stimulize? Stimulation?
777000	780000	People do random sounds and noises
780000	782000	Every now and then
782000	785000	You'll probably hear me do it out of the blue
790000	793000	Cartman voice line and goofy teaser please
799000	801000	Yes gamer, I get my girl
801000	803000	This is true
808000	810000	Cartman ASMR win
811000	813000	Oh my god
813000	815000	That's hilarious
815000	817000	That sounds like fun
817000	820000	I get me and ASMR, I would love to do that
822000	824000	I probably wouldn't be able to get through it
824000	826000	I'd laugh the entire time
826000	829000	I wouldn't be able to stop laughing
841000	845000	I can't even imagine doing a goofy ASMR
845000	848000	Oh god, that sounds amazing
848000	851000	That sounds so awesome
851000	853000	You?
855000	857000	I can't do it
857000	859000	I can't do it
861000	864000	My body just won't let me
870000	872000	I can't do it
891000	893000	Oh my god
896000	898000	Oh man, okay
899000	902000	I have like bad like
902000	905000	I have like ADHD right?
905000	909000	I would weekend end up sitting here talking for like
909000	911000	For hours
911000	914000	And I'd forget everything else that I'm supposed to be doing
914000	918000	So let's make sure we stay on track
918000	920000	Okay
929000	931000	Chatting is the best thing
931000	934000	It is, I enjoy it a lot
945000	949000	I still want to get through a lot of stuff
949000	951000	I don't want to get too distracted
951000	955000	But I do like talking to you guys a lot
955000	958000	Like seeing what you guys have to say
958000	960000	And your questions
960000	965000	And you guys get to know me as me
968000	972000	I am still Azura, but yeah
973000	976000	Professional Yapper, yeah
976000	979000	Totally professional
985000	990000	I'm sorry I needed more water
990000	992000	You know when you talk a lot
992000	994000	You gotta drink a lot of water
994000	997000	A lot, a lot, a lot of water
997000	999000	Don't stop water
1001000	1003000	Okay
1005000	1007000	I want you to do this
1007000	1009000	And
1010000	1012000	Okay, hang on
1012000	1015000	Plop, plop, plop, plop, plop, plop, plop
1015000	1017000	What do I click?
1017000	1019000	Where are we?
1021000	1023000	I still just see him
1029000	1031000	I did it
1031000	1033000	I figured it out
1033000	1037000	Oh no, that's not supposed to be on screen yet
1037000	1039000	Oh no
1042000	1044000	Oh no
1063000	1066000	That's fine, that's pretend
1066000	1071000	That everything is fine
1071000	1073000	Everything is perfectly fine
1073000	1074000	Just like this
1074000	1076000	This is how it's supposed to have been
1076000	1077000	Just like this
1077000	1079000	It was like this from the start
1080000	1082000	Ever from the start
1087000	1089000	That's right, you saw nothing
1089000	1091000	You saw nothing
1091000	1093000	Only mommy
1094000	1096000	Only me, you only saw me
1096000	1098000	No one else
1098000	1100000	Nothing else
1102000	1104000	Okay
1114000	1116000	Alright
1116000	1118000	I'm on it
1118000	1120000	I worried so like
1120000	1122000	I was like
1122000	1124000	When I set up these slides
1124000	1126000	I swear
1126000	1128000	I thought it was super fun
1128000	1131000	I was looking up these collars
1131000	1133000	To look like a little milk
1133000	1134000	Like animation
1134000	1136000	I wanted this little animation to be like
1136000	1138000	Milk
1138000	1140000	So I didn't know
1140000	1142000	How to like
1143000	1144000	Do it
1144000	1146000	So I did the little waves
1146000	1147000	And I like searched it up
1147000	1149000	Like how to do the waves
1149000	1154000	I'm not really good with the technical stuff
1154000	1156000	When it comes to these kind of things
1156000	1158000	But I really don't
1158000	1160000	I really do like looking into it
1160000	1162000	And so I was like
1162000	1163000	I want milk
1163000	1165000	I want it to be on the background
1165000	1167000	So I thought it was like really cool
1167000	1168000	Okay
1171000	1173000	So I thought that was Zura
1175000	1176000	I just wanted to add that
1176000	1178000	So I did want to go over
1178000	1180000	My interest
1180000	1182000	My interest
1182000	1184000	And I mentioned
1184000	1187000	That I watch a lot of anime
1187000	1189000	But
1189000	1191000	When I said a lot of anime
1191000	1194000	And I said a thousand anime
1194000	1196000	I really meant it
1196000	1198000	Like I've actually
1198000	1200000	When I was younger
1202000	1204000	I used to
1204000	1205000	Make a list
1205000	1206000	Like I would
1206000	1207000	I had a book
1207000	1208000	I still have it
1208000	1210000	I had a book
1210000	1212000	Like a notebook
1212000	1213000	Where I wrote down
1213000	1216000	Every anime I finished
1216000	1217000	I would write down
1217000	1220000	Every anime I finished
1220000	1223000	And I got up to
1223000	1225000	A thousand seven hundred
1225000	1227000	And then I
1227000	1228000	I just stopped
1228000	1230000	Writing down anime
1230000	1231000	After that
1231000	1232000	So the threshold
1232000	1233000	Of how much anime
1233000	1235000	I've watched in between there
1235000	1237000	And then and there
1237000	1239000	Was
1239000	1241000	Probably in like
1241000	1243000	Two thousand four hundred now
1254000	1256000	Does Azul like
1256000	1257000	Overlord?
1257000	1258000	Yes!
1258000	1260000	I've watched Overlord
1260000	1261000	Do I like Re Zero?
1261000	1263000	Yes! I've watched Re Zero
1263000	1265000	I
1268000	1270000	Thoughts on
1270000	1271000	Reincarnation
1271000	1272000	To the slime season
1272000	1274000	I'm actually
1274000	1276000	Kind of a little bit
1276000	1278000	Disappointed
1278000	1279000	In the
1279000	1281000	The new season
1281000	1283000	Because
1283000	1285000	It was like
1285000	1287000	They spent like
1287000	1289000	Six episodes
1289000	1291000	I'm over exaggerating
1291000	1294000	They spent so many episodes just talking
1294000	1295000	Talking
1295000	1296000	Talking
1296000	1297000	Talking
1297000	1298000	And I'm up to date
1298000	1299000	So you have to wait a week
1299000	1300000	For the next episode
1300000	1301000	Only for them to
1301000	1302000	Talk more
1302000	1303000	Talk more
1303000	1304000	Talk more
1304000	1305000	Then they're like
1305000	1306000	Oh there's going to be a fight
1306000	1307000	In the next episode
1307000	1308000	More talking
1308000	1309000	More talking
1309000	1311000	More talking
1312000	1313000	They spent
1313000	1314000	Those episodes
1314000	1316000	Literally at the same table
1316000	1317000	The same table
1317000	1319000	The same scene
1319000	1321000	All they did was switch seats
1323000	1325000	All they did was switch seats
1325000	1327000	And then when the
1327000	1328000	Big scene came
1328000	1329000	I won't spoil it
1329000	1331000	For anyone who's watching
1331000	1332000	Won't spoil it
1332000	1334000	Then when the big scene came
1334000	1336000	The big big major scene
1336000	1337000	Where you know
1337000	1339000	The big stuff was going to happen
1339000	1341000	Literally they
1341000	1343000	They like separate it and was like
1343000	1344000	Yeah let's
1344000	1345000	Me and you pair up
1345000	1347000	Yeah how about we go over here
1347000	1348000	How about we go over here
1348000	1349000	Then they don't even show it
1349000	1351000	They don't even show the fight
1352000	1354000	They don't even show it
1355000	1356000	We don't even get to see
1356000	1358000	Each character fight
1364000	1365000	Yeah I was disappointed
1365000	1366000	I was disappointed
1366000	1367000	Animation's still good
1367000	1369000	But I was very disappointed
1379000	1384000	I finally
1384000	1385000	Kept up
1385000	1387000	What other animals
1388000	1390000	Yes I've watched TVZ
1390000	1391000	I've watched the big threes
1391000	1392000	I've watched the big fives
1392000	1394000	I've watched all the big ones
1394000	1396000	Really famous ones
1396000	1397000	100%
1397000	1399000	I'm a big Naruto fan
1399000	1400000	I've watched it
1400000	1402000	For the whole 15 years
1402000	1403000	Of Naruto
1403000	1405000	So I'm a huge Naruto fan
1405000	1407000	I have all the games
1407000	1408000	I've had all the games
1408000	1410000	Someone stole two of my games
1410000	1411000	But we won't
1411000	1412000	We'll talk about that
1416000	1417000	I am not a fan of
1417000	1418000	Naruto
1419000	1420000	I'm sorry
1420000	1421000	I know a lot of people like
1421000	1422000	Naruto
1422000	1423000	But I'm not a fan of
1423000	1424000	Naruto
1424000	1425000	I don't like
1425000	1426000	I don't like that child
1430000	1431000	Though I still watch it
1431000	1432000	Because I'm still a fan
1432000	1434000	Of the series itself
1434000	1436000	I have to watch it
1436000	1438000	I cannot not watch it
1438000	1439000	I have to watch it
1449000	1451000	Naruto made me angry
1451000	1452000	It's like
1452000	1453000	I've been with Naruto
1453000	1454000	For so long
1454000	1456000	That I understand
1456000	1457000	His pain
1457000	1458000	What he had to do
1458000	1460000	To get to where he was
1460000	1461000	And he doesn't understand
1461000	1463000	The concept of being a parent
1463000	1465000	And I understand
1466000	1467000	Naruto
1468000	1470000	Needing a parent by him
1470000	1471000	But
1471000	1473000	And I understand he's still a kid
1473000	1474000	And he can't understand
1474000	1475000	This concept
1475000	1477000	Of what Naruto went through
1477000	1479000	But they're hiding it from him
1479000	1481000	And it made it a little worse
1481000	1483000	Like just tell the kid
1483000	1484000	Tell him
1484000	1485000	Tell him
1485000	1486000	Tell him what happened
1488000	1489000	Tell him
1489000	1491000	So that he could finally understand
1491000	1492000	And mature
1492000	1494000	And stop being a brat
1495000	1497000	It's such a brat
1502000	1503000	Well of course
1503000	1504000	My favorite character
1504000	1505000	Is Hinata

1526000	1527000	Really really hard
1527000	1528000	To get where he is
1529000	1530000	And to be
1530000	1531000	At the top of where everyone is
1531000	1532000	Like come on

1553000	1554000	I
1559000	1560000	Yeah
1560000	1561000	Rock Lee vs. Gar was the best fight
1561000	1562000	Whenever
1562000	1563000	Little
1563000	1565000	It was a great fight

1581000	1582000	I know you're pissed
1582000	1584000	I watched so many more anime
1584000	1586000	I watched Yu Yu Hakusho
1586000	1588000	I watched all the old old anime
1590000	1591000	Dang
1591000	1592000	I watched Inuyasha
1592000	1594000	I think Inuyasha was like
1594000	1595000	What
1595000	1597000	Like really got me into anime
1597000	1598000	A long time ago
1598000	1599000	Since
1600000	1602000	Way back when
1602000	1604000	I used to be a poor poor child
1606000	1607000	I still am
1609000	1611000	Didn't have a TV
1611000	1612000	Didn't have anything
1612000	1613000	So
1613000	1615000	When I went to go visit
1616000	1617000	Family
1617000	1618000	I would stay over
1618000	1619000	And they had a TV
1619000	1621000	And it would stay on all night
1621000	1623000	And I would sleep
1623000	1625000	And watching cartoons
1625000	1626000	Cartoons
1626000	1627000	And
1627000	1628000	You fall asleep
1628000	1630000	And in the middle of the night
1631000	1632000	You know
1632000	1634000	The ending would play
1634000	1636000	And
1640000	1642000	And it would wake me up
1642000	1643000	And then I would sit there
1643000	1644000	And I would watch it
1644000	1645000	Like
1645000	1647000	And then I'd end up watching
1647000	1648000	You Know Yasha
1648000	1649000	And then after that
1649000	1650000	I really got into watching
1650000	1651000	You Know Yasha
1651000	1652000	And then I started watching
1652000	1653000	More anime
1653000	1654000	And more
1654000	1655000	I was watching
1655000	1656000	The Big O
1656000	1657000	Cowboy Bebop
1659000	1660000	All of this came on
1660000	1662000	On Adult Swem
1662000	1664000	I was watching all of these
1664000	1665000	On the TV
1669000	1670000	I definitely shouldn't
1670000	1671000	Have been watching these things
1671000	1673000	Given how old I was then
1675000	1677000	But I was watching all of them
1682000	1683000	I remember
1683000	1684000	When I first watched
1684000	1685000	Caster & Sins
1685000	1686000	It was a
1686000	1687000	Thanksgiving day
1687000	1688000	And
1689000	1690000	They turned on the TV
1690000	1691000	To keep the
1691000	1692000	Kitties distracted
1692000	1693000	And
1693000	1695000	They knew I liked anime
1695000	1696000	But they didn't know
1696000	1697000	What anime was really about
1697000	1699000	So they just turned it on
1699000	1700000	The TV
1700000	1701000	And Caster & Sins
1701000	1702000	Like a marathon was running
1702000	1704000	And I watched the whole thing
1704000	1705000	While I was sitting there
1705000	1706000	On the floor
1707000	1708000	Like
1708000	1709000	Wah
1709000	1710000	Wah
1712000	1713000	That's crazy
1721000	1722000	It's like a
1722000	1723000	Whole marathon
1727000	1728000	Are you watching the new
1728000	1729000	Spice & Wolf?
1729000	1730000	It's on my
1730000	1731000	To watch list
1731000	1732000	I really enjoyed
1732000	1733000	The first
1733000	1734000	Spice & Wolf
1735000	1736000	The original
1736000	1737000	Before they did the remake
1737000	1738000	I really
1738000	1739000	I watched the whole thing
1740000	1741000	And I know the whole song
1741000	1743000	Seven apples on a
1743000	1744000	Witch's tree
1746000	1747000	With seven seas
1747000	1749000	A plant inside of me
1750000	1751000	And springtime
1751000	1752000	I sing
1752000	1753000	A magic song
1755000	1756000	Then skipping along
1757000	1758000	I sing
1758000	1759000	A song to everyone
1760000	1761000	I look at the world
1761000	1762000	Through
1762000	1763000	Apple eyes
1764000	1765000	I cut myself a slice
1765000	1766000	Of sunshine pie
1768000	1769000	I know that whole song
1773000	1774000	So I have it on my
1774000	1775000	To watch list
1775000	1776000	I was waiting
1776000	1777000	For all the episodes
1777000	1778000	To come out
1778000	1779000	So it's on my list
1779000	1780000	To watch the
1780000	1781000	New Spice & Wolf
1802000	1803000	Any guilty pleasure
1803000	1804000	Animated
1804000	1805000	Ease
1805000	1806000	Like
1806000	1808000	An anime that's trash
1808000	1809000	But you can't get enough
1815000	1816000	None that I could
1816000	1817000	Think of
1820000	1821000	I don't think
1821000	1822000	I could think
1822000	1823000	Of one right now
1823000	1824000	I know a
1824000	1825000	Bunch of anime
1825000	1826000	That has
1826000	1827000	Like really bad animation
1827000	1829000	But the plot
1829000	1830000	Is so funny
1830000	1831000	So I still like it
1831000	1832000	Or like
1832000	1833000	It's chaotic
1833000	1838640	like childish anime that I really like it was an anime that I used to watch when I
1838640	1845420	was younger called Kadocha Kadocha was like a little girl named like was it
1845420	1852740	Sonako? Sonako? She would sing into this toy.
1856420	1866360	Super old anime so old no one knows of it but it was so funny to me it was
1866360	1870060	hilarious to me I found it very funny a lot of people would probably watch it
1870060	1875220	now I'd be like what the hell sounds horrible this looks terrible
1884540	1891180	I do like Belle's above 100% it's a good it's a good anime I really love
1891500	1897900	anime is that um that have delinquents in it I love delinquency
1897900	1906660	delinquency anime is so good I just love their voice
1906660	1915020	I just like the way they talk and the way they yell at each other it's my
1915020	1918260	favorite so one or there is a delinquent in an anime they're like usually my
1918260	1933420	favorite favorite characters and yes I watched I shield 21 as well I really
1933420	1937700	like sports anime as well so I put blue lock because it was like one of the
1937700	1944300	newest like recent ones that I've watched and I like I like when they're
1944300	1949020	really suspenseful and I think blue lock really hit that like I've been
1949020	1954500	craving a sports anime with really good animation that is really suspenseful for
1954500	1958740	a while and then with blue lock came out it was like that was that was it that
1958740	1965460	was the one it was really hype it had me really into it and I've watched a
1965460	1970460	haikyo I've watched I've watched and read the manga of Prince of Tennis
1970460	1975500	because I've read the manga first before I watched the anime so I read the manga
1975500	1989420	I read Prince of Tennis I free haikyo I liked haikyo a lot I liked a lot of a
1989420	1997700	lot of the anime is any opinion on the JoJo series I watched the whole JoJo
1997700	2012100	series I've seen the whole thing all of it I love that I just people there's a
2012100	2021780	what's that sumo anime called haji haji haji something sumo I don't know sumo I
2022100	2028140	watch that too I really love the opening of that song a lot it's one of my
2028140	2037060	favorite openings he know he mode he no matter sumo yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
2037060	2043180	yeah yeah the opening is so awesome I love it it's a really good opening I
2043180	2050540	didn't expect it and I think the opening is what really made me continue to watch
2050540	2057900	the anime have you seen our bleach I haven't seen the new bleach stuff that
2057900	2065660	came out because I don't like cliffhangers so I was waiting for a majority of
2065660	2069380	episodes to come out cuz I like to bench sit down with some ice cream some
2069380	2078580	popcorn turn off my lights good comfy cozy wrapping up like it and then bench
2078620	2087420	big old bench I haven't seen the new bleach yet but I stopped at the the old
2087420	2094020	old bleach I seen the whole season like can you get a big hug yeah you can get a
2094020	2101460	big hug a big hug there you go yeah hug for a job
2108180	2113980	binging is the best favorite bleach opening oh that's hard that's very hard
2113980	2117980	because I listened to like a bunch of openings and I think all of them are
2117980	2131060	really good I don't know that one stuck in my head so that one gets easily stuck
2131060	2137980	in my head so probably that one I think it's opening six if I remember correctly
2147980	2157860	yeah I think that's opening sex
2157860	2170620	NASA loans now I'm stuck in my head it gets stuck in my head really like fast
2171340	2185060	do you watch harem anime I do but I am not like a mega big fan of certain harem
2185060	2192220	anime because I'm not a fan of certain MC characters that are like like
2192220	2199060	extremely dumb they make me really mad
2199180	2204700	it makes me super mad with how dense they could be like how can you be so
2204700	2213060	dense how how how are you stop it are you dumb
2213060	2219540	who's right with you she wants you
2219540	2235300	I watched it is only certain harem anime that really catch my attention and I
2235300	2240500	guess it's I guess it's where the MC sometimes really don't want anything to
2240500	2247780	do with the other girls and they don't get beat up I like where the girls
2247780	2253820	aren't that cliche niche where they like beat up the MC all the time for like
2253820	2266020	small things like really small things like why are you beating him up why why I
2266020	2272620	thought his joke was really funny I thought it was funny I laughed
2277780	2281260	he didn't do nothing wrong
2285700	2290420	especially if you really like the character like if she the character
2290420	2296900	right really likes the MC and he happened to see something right and he
2296900	2302420	actually generally felt bad about it why hit him there's no need to hit him
2302420	2306060	it'll be different if he was like one of those characters to really really really
2306420	2321580	really really poorly what and they did that you know the extreme I would get it
2321580	2340660	I would get one in you know beat them up all right but so Cassie yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
2340920	2343640	yeah
2347540	2352820	we're them up deserved
2356340	2363320	guy probably not dense because I keep hitting him in the head
2364560	2368700	its probably true
2370660	2383020	I've seen Beyblade X. I don't have a big opinion on it actually. I've seen it so long ago
2383020	2387900	that I don't really have it. I can't really give an opinion on like extremely extremely
2387900	2394700	old anime or shows or cartoons because they're really old. That's like asking me what are
2394700	2399900	my opinions on Pokemon and I've watched the entire Pokemon series. I'm a huge Pokemon
2399900	2408500	fan. I've played almost a majority of all Pokemon games. I love Pokemon. Do I have an
2408500	2413260	opinion on the show itself? No. I don't. I don't. I can't give you that. I can't give
2413260	2426660	you that answer. I love Pokemon. That's all that matters. I even have a Digimon plushie
2426660	2436660	sitting up there. But Digimon plushie, Pikachu plushie, a bunch of plushies. I collect quite
2436660	2447620	a lot of them. Oh my god someone mentioned Negima. Oh my god I really loved Negima. I
2447620	2455740	don't know why. But I loved Negima. It gets a pass. A big pass for me. He was an intelligent
2455740	2461260	character. He was really smart. He may be a little bit dense but he was smart. I liked
2461260	2473860	him. I liked Negima. That was good anime. Singles for that Yokai anime. What was it called?
2473860	2489180	It's not really a harem. I wouldn't really call it a harem anime. What was it called?
2489180	2499620	It's like the Yokai anime where he turns into the guy with the really long hair. The white
2499620	2518580	hair that comes out really long in the back. Yeah. Yes! That's the one. That's the one.
2518580	2542500	Oh my god I can't even say that. I can't even say that. I'm gonna butcher it. I can't
2542500	2553740	for that stuff. Look I said I'm still learning Japanese. The big words like that's hard. It
2553740	2571140	is norari. I like that one. That's good. I sure people mentioned some more anime but
2571140	2580740	I probably missed it. I'm sorry if I missed it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've seen a few
2580740	2604500	other anime. We've been talking about anime for almost literally an hour. Oh no. No tarem.
2605140	2618180	We have the hardest role. Yes I've seen Shaman King. I can tell you my favorite cartoons
2618180	2631180	or anime from Four Kids TV. I watched Yu-Gi-Oh! Pokemon. Spider Writers. I watched Bakugan
2631180	2649780	and Battle Brawlers. I watched all of them. Everything. I literally went on when I first
2649780	2660940	got my big chunky PC. I was like binging all the shows that I could get my hands on. With
2660940	2667340	the Wicked Rise, The World Girl, Howling Hall, Spider Writers. Spider Writers V2. If you
2667340	2673180	truly want to be V2, it's cool. You can join our team. I know all the songs too.
2673180	2702620	Oh, I like my favorite song. I like the original Yu-Gi-Oh! But there's not a lot of singing. It's
2702620	2713020	just. But I think Five D's was my favorite. Yu-Gi-Oh! Five D's.
2732620	2739820	Feel the wind is blowing me around. Take a shot at me and run this side by side. It's
2739820	2749180	a blur as I go by. I can't hear you breathing. I can't see you coming. I can't feel the wind
2749180	2761100	is blowing me around. See the sunrise and fire in the sky. Greatness thrust itself into our lives.
2763580	2764220	Yeah.
2772460	2781180	I loved Yu-Gi-Oh! Five D's. It was good. And the show called Blue Dragon. Blue Dragon, yeah.
2781900	2787020	It looks like, I think the artist is literally the creator of Dragon Ball Z because they look the
2787180	2794620	same. They look exactly the same. I've watched Detective Conan. Yes, yes, yes. Isn't Detective
2794620	2800380	Conan still ongoing? I've watched like a few seasons but I don't think I've continued to watch it
2800380	2805020	because there was so much. It's like one piece and I'm like also watching one piece as well.
2805020	2816060	It's like the Conan is still kicking.
2821180	2827820	Blue Dragon game was kind of ass. It's true. I agree. But the series was pretty good. And then it
2827820	2832780	just kind of died. I don't know what happened to it. I don't know if it got cancelled or something.
2832780	2837180	It just was gone. The show Akira, I watched that too.
2841580	2843740	Goddess of Anime and Fertility.
2849580	2858380	Any genre I dislike? Probably Mecha. I'm sorry everyone. I'm sorry. There's only a few Mecha
2858380	2867260	that are in my heart early. But any other Mecha besides Neon Genesis, besides Full Metal Panic,
2867820	2870700	Code Geass. If it's not those animes, I don't like it.
2875660	2882700	I love Code Geass. I love Full Metal Panic and I love Neon Genesis. And was it, was the other one?
2883500	2888220	There was another Mecha anime that I like but I don't remember the name of.
2890380	2897420	Even Gallant. Yes, yes, yes. I like that too. No worries. No worries there. If it's not those,
2897420	2900620	if it's like those other Mecha anime, I'm not really a big fan.
2902300	2911900	Oh, I love Fuli Kuli. I love Fuli Kuli. Fuli Kuli is awesome. What? It's not even like a big Mecha anime.
2912780	2919580	I like Goren Lagin but I really hate one of the characters.
2922140	2927420	One of the female characters made me angry so she makes me not like the show.
2929820	2936940	Eruka 7? I like Eruka 7. Like I said, there's only a few Mecha anime that win my heart over.
2937900	2941180	Only a few. Majority of the new ones I don't really like.
2951980	2958940	Yes, I watched Sparx Family. I really like the first season so I haven't really, I started
2958940	2966460	on the next season but I haven't gone up to date so I like watched three episodes of the new season
2966460	2973660	and then I kind of stopped. Their approach on the new season kind of like got me a little bored
2974300	2979500	because they're like individually going at every character, giving each character their own episode.
2980380	2985260	They didn't really do that in the first season so it kind of throws me off a little bit because I don't
2986300	2991980	really like, usually it was a combination of everyone and then focused on Anya and now it's
2992460	2996300	everyone gets their own special episode and I kind of like don't care.
3001900	3006300	I don't know if that's just me not being able to process it very well but
3007900	3012940	have you seen To Your Internity? To Your Internity is the first anime to ever make me cry
3012940	3017900	in the first episode. The first anime to ever make me cry in the first episode.
3018860	3031900	I love Death Note, of course I do. Oh my god, I love Durarara. I love Durarara as well.
3031900	3037820	We're gonna sit here and talk about anime this entire time. There's so much stuff I wanted to talk about.
3038300	3050140	I'm having fun. This is fun. Talking about anime gives you like really relaxed,
3050140	3056140	really into it and it's like one of my biggest passions because when I'm really sad and feeling
3056140	3065340	down and you know, I want to watch anime. It makes me feel so much better.
3066300	3072060	So I like binged anime like throughout my whole life. Anime is great.
3072780	3089740	Free Wren. Free Wren is, I finished that whole, I think that anime was amazing.
3089740	3096060	There are a lot of hate on Free Wren. There's so much hate on that anime because it's like,
3096940	3105020	it seems boring to the eyes of a lot of people. It doesn't meet the target audience,
3105740	3116300	but I think it's so good. It tackles a whole another view on adventure as a whole.
3118460	3124540	All anime is always focused, fantasy focus is always on the focus of what happens before.
3125340	3130940	They defeat the demon lord, what happens before, everything they have to do and go through and
3130940	3139020	you build this like towards the character in the moment. But imagine being someone who lives
3139020	3149180	for a long time and being surrounded by people who don't and you spent an entire time living
3149260	3154460	up with these people throughout your whole life and then they're gone.
3155180	3161340	And now you have this, now it's like usually, anime would end on that and be like, oh that was the
3161340	3166060	story of how we defeated the demon lord and then we'll never see what happens afterwards. We get
3166060	3174460	to see the after, the memories and still gain a connection to old characters that you don't see
3174460	3180700	later on and I think that's really awesome. And then the animation is amazing given the fact
3180700	3189580	that it was drawn by hand. Everything was drawn by hand. It is amazing. They did so good for,
3189580	3195740	especially for a studio that was, you know, a lot of their stuff in the past was really bad.
3196940	3202940	They stepped it up. They stepped it up with this anime. Oh sorry, I got really into that one. I'm so sorry.
3205180	3218380	I'm sorry, I got really passionate with that one.
3225180	3229420	Oh yes, I watched Assassination Classroom. I think it's a really good anime as well.
3235180	3256060	I feel so bad for the the elf though, for Friren. Given the fact that she is, you know,
3256060	3261900	an elf and living for a long time, you don't really process the feelings of how humans process them.
3262700	3269980	So I understand that. I really do understand that of being so out of touch with their own emotion
3269980	3280860	sometimes and not understanding the concept of love and other feelings of, you know, things like
3280860	3285420	that because, you know, when you say I'll see you later for an elf, that could be like, I'll see you
3285420	3294300	later, like a hundred years later, like imagine someone liking you and you're like, and it's
3294300	3303420	whatever. And then they like, then they're gone and then you're like, well, damn, well, damn.
3304540	3309660	Now you know, you know, you cry, you cry. All you could do is cry and you feel for her like, oh,
3310620	3314700	it took her so long to realize this and understand.
3318460	3326380	Make me cry. I'm really emotional when it comes to watching anime. Anime does not fail to make
3326380	3330620	me cry. If it's like really an emotional part or piece, I will probably cry.
3330620	3337500	Pixel games? Yeah, I like pixel games, like, you know, like One Shot,
3338700	3347260	Stardew Valley, you know, games like that. I like those kind of games, but I didn't really know
3347260	3354140	how to like pinpoint it, like Terraria. I call those pixel games because I don't know what else to
3354140	3360140	call them though. I call those pixel games. I don't know what else to call them though.
3361580	3367500	Yeah, I like Cal World. I like open world games and building games. I like farming games. I like
3367500	3375820	simulating games. I like games where you just shut your brain off and play. I love it. I do, do, do.
3376380	3385820	Let me do a Monster Hunter stream. I want to, I'm a little nervous too, because it's not a game that I
3387180	3394140	play often, but I have played it a few times and I loved it, but I never found the time to play it
3394140	3401500	again. So I played it a few times, so it became one of my favorite games to play every now and then.
3401820	3408940	Um, do I like the game Dead by Daylight? I have played it once when it was free to play,
3410620	3417660	but I've never actually played it, but I have watched some gameplay because I did like the game
3417660	3435020	itself. It looks fun, but yeah. I really do like One Shot a lot because I think it's super cute.
3436300	3445660	I liked it so much so that I ended up getting a Nico, a Nico plushie. I have a Nico plushie,
3446540	3450460	and the light bulb is like magnet and it like attaches to his hands.
3457900	3463900	That's one of my favorite games. I really like that. So I can't wait to play it again. I'm so
3463900	3469980	excited to play it once more. Yeah, I mean, or for the first time ever. Yeah.
3475900	3489500	I actually added a few games that I haven't played. No, I haven't actually, I'm reading this list.
3491580	3499260	There's only one game I haven't played and that's Little Nightmares. I have the game and I've had
3499260	3505980	the game in my library for a really, really long time, for a really, really, really long time,
3507340	3512460	but I've never played it. So it's been a game that I've been wanting to play for a really long time.
3512460	3514860	This is there.
3520940	3525260	Yeah, I hear it's short, but I want to play the whole series, Little Nightmares.
3525260	3534300	One, two, and I don't think three is out yet. So that's why I want to play it.
3539820	3547980	All right, fine. Fine. I've been seeing this question a lot. All right. Listen to me. Listen
3547980	3554380	to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Are you guys listening? Are you listening? Are you listening?
3555020	3561580	Can you hear me? Are you listening? Listen to me. Listen, listen, listen.
3564380	3575020	I like it, all right? I like it. I like it. I like League of Legends. All right? All right? All right?
3577500	3579820	I like League of Legends.
3584380	3610940	Look, look, look, look, look, look. I don't know why. Look, I don't know why.
3611900	3619660	I don't know why. I do not recommend playing this game. Don't play it. It's a dictation.
3621180	3629740	But I played it for so long. I played it for so long. For so, so very long. All right? I can't help it.
3630860	3637100	It's a good game for me. I don't listen. I don't, I don't really talk in the chat. I don't really
3637100	3643340	talk in the, in the game. I don't really, I just like to turn off my brain, play some good old norms,
3644060	3651660	go mid lane, and just farm, murder a person in a game.
3655420	3659660	And, and, and, you know, just chat, you know? It's like really, it's like,
3661020	3666300	it's like the, it's like a good chatting stream for me. I have ADHD and I like flashing colors,
3666300	3674060	okay? I like the flashing colors and the abilities. While I'm just literally staring at my screen,
3674060	3691820	all right? I've gotten so far in the game as in like, it's like, it's like a, it's like a
3691820	3701500	gotcha game, almost kind of like, similar. Yeah. I have so much stuff on it, on the account that I had
3701500	3707260	that I, I didn't want to stop playing. I collected so much stuff. I was like, I don't want to stop
3707260	3715260	playing. I got so much stuff, I could get more, more, I need more, more, please, more, please, more.
3715740	3725980	Please, please. I almost have every champion, more champions, more, more.
3731660	3732620	We can fix her.
3738380	3744380	We're rolled to your man. I usually made mid. I usually made mid lane, but sometimes I go support.
3746220	3752140	But I made mid. My favorite champion that I like to play is Zyra.
3753260	3757500	She's a babe, bro. That's a very hot babe.
3762060	3764620	Something about her seeds being inside of you, some chat.
3768540	3769660	Isn't that one of her lines?
3769660	3776780	Wait until my, wait as I plant my seeds inside of you.
3778700	3782940	That's one of her voice lines. I swear. I swear.
3785180	3785980	I swear.
3786860	3787340	Wait.
3798540	3799340	I swear.
3813580	3815820	I could be a little bit thummy sometimes.
3816540	3818220	Hey, sometimes.
3822300	3823580	Only if you want me to be.
3824620	3829260	Look, all right. I know some of you have sent me a lot of things asking if I was
3829820	3835980	so boredom and stuff like that, but I'm, I'm, I'm just, I'm weird.
3838060	3844620	You'll get what I give you and you'll love it regardless. So does it really matter?
3846220	3850300	You'll probably get a little bit of both. So, you know.
3851660	3852140	All right.
3861980	3864220	That's the first one. The answer is I swear to you.
3870300	3871580	Chat volume warning.
3876860	3882140	Okay. We've been on this slide for a while. We could always talk about more anime
3883260	3887020	and another like Zazzledon stream or something. It's a little just chatting stream.
3892620	3899980	So let's move on. I want to just go over some more things and stuff with you guys.
3899980	3910780	We, we spent over an hour on that. Maybe we could talk more about it another time.
3912700	3919580	We have, we have more than enough time to talk about so many things, right?
3920620	3921900	So many, so many things.
3925580	3926140	But yes.
3930860	3937980	To say my name was anime talk true. All right. I'm about to keep thing up with time. So
3943500	3947740	it feels shorter. It really does. It feels like we just started.
3951820	3953260	I do want to say
3953580	3964780	that these cookies have been staring at me this entire time and they're taunting me.
3964780	3967420	And I want to eat them. I want to eat them so bad.
3967820	3984780	I want you to understand me. I want you to know that I do. I know a lot of people were like confused
3984780	3995100	about my, wait, was that, was it squishy, squishy, squishy, squishy? Are you a baker? Because I want to
3995100	4009740	grab your, bro, bro, bro.
4009900	4014700	Squishy why? Squishy why?
4024380	4026620	I thought it was like a genuine question.
4029740	4031180	I got trolled.
4040460	4046300	Dang it. Papa's over here scaring, trolling me.
4053100	4061100	I believe there is a public discord server that gives you notifications when we go live and
4061100	4068060	stuff. But we are not in it. You will not find us in it. But I do recommend joining it if you
4068140	4072620	want updates for when everyone goes live. Especially me. Because I know you want to be
4073260	4079980	up to date whenever I'm here. I want everyone to see me, hear my voice, talk to me.
4083580	4084140	Oh my god.
4092380	4093020	I'm gone.
4093900	4098540	Oh my tootie crap.
4111580	4115820	I didn't go anywhere. I don't know what you're talking about. I was here the whole time.
4117980	4119340	I was here the whole time.
4123420	4139020	Oh, we're fine. Everything's fine. Everything's okay.
4139340	4154060	You're probably going to experience so much scuff and all my streams, extreme extreme scuff.
4158140	4161020	We're fine. Everything's great.
4169900	4180220	All right. So yes, I am a baker. I bake stuff sometimes when I'm like feeling like in a really
4180220	4185500	mood to have sweets and I really want it. I make brownies, cupcakes, cakes.
4187020	4192140	I was learning how to make cheesecakes and all sorts of stuff. Grand crackers, cookies.
4195420	4196300	So many other stuff.
4199740	4207660	So, however, these are things that I wanted to do on stream, like a handcam stream and stuff like
4207660	4215180	that. So I want to do these things. I want to cook for you guys and show you my cakes and stuff,
4215180	4221020	but I am very limited in being able to do that with my living situation.
4221980	4237020	Yeah, I live with a pretty big family. So doing that won't be possible right away.
4239340	4250460	So when I'm able to move out, which I hope is soon, but I would have to save up quite a bit
4250460	4258940	before I could do that. I will be free to do a lot more things for streams and stuff like that.
4263020	4264060	That's so sudden.
4264460	4274780	I want to make threads and fake stuff.
4282220	4288140	For now, I could just like show you like pictures and stuff on stream or on Twitter,
4289100	4300700	the Twitter, Twitter, or X, I mean, sorry, X, X, Xter, X sweeter. What do you call it?
4301420	4304620	Is it okay to say that here? Can I say that here?
4307100	4310460	I want to show you pictures and stuff, and I'll do that and stuff right now.
4318540	4323820	I still call it Twitter.
4328940	4336300	I want, I think, Stronius spoke about this, about how there were some people wanting to make
4336300	4341660	cover songs. I think I was one of the girls that really, really, really, really, really,
4341660	4357660	super one to make of our song. I want to sing for you guys. I want to sing for you guys.
4357660	4370780	I sing songs and stuff for you. I'm very subconscious of my voice when I speak normally. I'm really
4370780	4378460	surprised you guys like my voice. I was really surprised when Stroni liked my voice. I was
4378460	4385660	all very surprised. This is a very honest opinion of mine. A lot of people think my voice is fake
4386380	4391980	or my voice is like I'm doing too much. There are people who would always tell me that I sound
4391980	4399660	like a child or a kid. Or I sound like a pupas and child and stuff like that. People tell me that
4399740	4405980	all the time. But I've been very subconscious of my voice for a long time.
4409820	4417420	To me, I think my voice is horrible. But a lot of you really like my voice. So I'm happy. You do.
4419740	4429500	I'm happy. I'm glad you like it. But I do have a list. So I pronounce a lot of words really
4429500	4441340	badly. I have a really bad list. List. List. I swear the person who created that word is evil.
4441340	4447340	They created that word knowing that people with one can't say it. They're evil. That's all I'll say.
4459580	4471740	They're evil. So that's why I speak the way I speak. Because I have a list.
4473020	4476460	So I'm sorry. I'm really sorry if my grammar is wack.
4476460	4488700	Or we're getting off track.
4506940	4516700	I am
4520060	4527820	really new to the ASMR scene.
4528460	4537180	I hope you don't mind. I'm a little new to ASMR scene.
4538300	4549180	So I hope you don't mind.
4549420	4562380	Drunk. A lot of people say that. That I sound like that. That I'm drunk. Do I?
4562380	4569340	Really? Do I sound like I'm drunk? But you don't really want to know what it really sounds like
4569340	4590620	when I get drunk. I don't know how a drunk person really sounds. But this is how I sound.
4590620	4595900	I don't know. It's very common. A lot of people say it. My family says the same thing to me.
4595900	4602220	That I always sound like I'm drunk. So I don't know. I think it's just my speech. It's very slurrish.
4603420	4608940	It's very slurrish. And the combination of the list makes it a lot more worse.
4614700	4623500	So yeah. I do have plans to do a drunk stream. But I want to also go over some things that
4626380	4632140	I kind of have to deal with that. With the drinking part thing. So
4635100	4639420	I do want to let everyone know that I am a little sickly.
4647260	4653900	I've been sick since I was like really young. I've had a lot of issues going on with like
4656700	4665340	my stomach. Intestinal issues. A lot of issues there. They found like a
4666540	4669180	kind of like a mass. But not like a
4671340	4684940	the the C word. Serous. The C word. Serous mass. It was found in my nose. My nasal cavity.
4686860	4691980	And it infected a lot of tissue. And I had to get that surgically removed.
4693340	4701340	So I have a lot of nasal issues. So that could also be why I sound kind of stuffy if I do to you.
4703020	4708940	But my nasal patches is pretty cleared up now after the surgery. So I'm good now.
4709660	4715740	So every now and then you'll probably I'll have to probably like spray my nose.
4716300	4721180	Just in case I get really stuffy. And then I start sounding like this the entire time.
4721180	4728140	Like I'm Squidward. And we don't want that.
4739820	4742940	So yeah.
4748620	4750140	So we don't want that.
4750380	4771340	I'm going miles per second. I click something I shouldn't have. All right, all right, we're fine.
4771340	4788700	And I'm not really green guys. I'm like I'm like a teal. I'm blue. All right. I look green.
4788700	4799740	But I'm blue. Don't let the colors fool you. The color spectrum is evil. All right. It's evil.
4799740	4802780	I see green. Yeah, I'm blue. All right.
4806940	4816620	I'm blue. And these are neck pillows. They are ears. They are my little gold ears. Okay. They're ears.
4816940	4820860	Please, please. Thank you.
4831660	4835980	That is all. Welcome back. Thank you for participating in my talk. Thank you.
4836220	4836700	Thank you.
4846220	4851980	But yes, I got a lot of physical issues with my shoulder.
4853980	4861180	My shoulder didn't develop properly. My shoulder didn't develop properly. And it took them like
4861260	4866460	many years for them to figure this out. So they finally took x-ray after telling me that I was
4866460	4871580	fine saying it was stress, stress, stress, stress, stress, stress. It's fine. It's fine. You're fine.
4871580	4877820	You're fine. And then they finally took x-ray. I got a better doctor like this is my 10th 12th
4877820	4884220	doctor that I went through. And they finally took x-ray. They seen that my shoulder is
4885180	4893260	didn't develop fully. So it causes pain in my right hand and in my elbow. And it travels
4893260	4898780	through my whole arm. So I have extreme pain. So I'm on like a bunch of pain medication.
4899820	4907180	So it makes me kind of loopy a little bit. So I'm just another reason why I probably sound like I'm
4907180	4919580	drunk. I also have my spine at my neck is isn't curved like a sea like it's supposed to. It's
4919580	4927500	actually straight. So I have permanent headaches that don't really go away. And I've had them
4928060	4929500	for a long time for years.
4936060	4941260	So I got a, I have pink colors for that too.
4941260	4955020	So yeah.
4955020	4957020	This is where I'm going to be the second care of you.
4957020	4968780	No.
4974780	4979660	I'm fine. Don't worry. I'm fine. I just want to be treated like everyone else.
4981340	4986380	A lot of people I usually tell always end up feeling really bad for me. Don't feel bad for me.
4987340	4993260	I just want to live my life. I want to live a life. It was really hard enough for me to
4993260	5000060	find work like outside of everything. People wouldn't hire me. And when they did hire me,
5000060	5004860	I was limited to doing stuff and they didn't like that. And I had to visit, I have to visit
5004860	5014300	a doctor every week. I have doctor's appointments every week. So they were upset that I had to
5014300	5019500	take time off every week. They didn't like that. They wanted me, they wanted all my time. So they
5019500	5027260	would always end up, you know, firing me. Whenever I got randomly sick on the job, they would get
5027260	5035900	upset. Ambulance had to come pick me up one time because I got really, really badly sick.
5036860	5044220	So I had stomach problems. So my stomach is very sensitive. If I eat certain food,
5044220	5050300	I could get food poisoning pretty easy. It could be really bad.
5052860	5059980	So I have a lot of issues. I don't mind talking about them. I really don't. I think I
5060540	5066700	saw that in there. I can show you. I don't mind talking about them. I don't. However,
5066700	5073580	I would appreciate if people wouldn't ask too much questions on it though. I appreciate it.
5073580	5079100	Please, please thank you. I just want to let you know now so that everyone knows and that if
5079100	5083420	anyone else asks, it's out there. The information is out there.
5089580	5090300	Okay, yeah, yeah.
5090540	5091020	Yeah.
5102540	5110220	There's some other issues I have. But a lot of it just deals with my, I was kind of
5110220	5118620	malnourished for a while. Yes, I'm a huge eater. I eat a lot and I used to, I have a really fast
5118700	5128780	metabolism. So I would eat like nonstop. This was like a few years ago. I used to eat like
5128780	5136860	three pizza pies, three whole pizza pies by myself. My metabolism is that fast. It was
5136860	5140540	that fast. I think it's slowly slowing down. Maybe, I don't know, I don't think so.
5147740	5151900	I eat a lot. So I'm a big foodie. I like food a lot.
5157820	5166620	But because of this, because I eat a ton or not enough when I need to, because I can go like
5166860	5172540	days without eating because I will forget. I feel like I like have this thing where I forget to eat.
5176300	5183260	And I wouldn't eat for days and stuff like that. So and then I'll have a random binge day and I'd
5183260	5192060	eat like a ton. So technically today, today I forgot to eat. Today, today I forgot to eat.
5192060	5195260	I'll tell the ones I didn't eat today.
5205340	5207260	I also forgot to eat yesterday.
5211340	5217420	But my family made me something to eat yesterday after they built. Don't worry.
5217820	5223900	Don't worry. Don't worry. I ate a little bit yesterday. It wasn't a lot, but I still ate a
5223900	5228700	little bit yesterday. Like a plate. I ate like one plate of something.
5228700	5235500	Don't tell everyone. No. Don't tell everyone. No. Don't tell.
5242780	5249660	Eat silly. Oh, eat. Eat. Don't tell Stroney. Don't tell Stroney.
5250460	5259260	But that's really just scold me. I'm getting in trouble. I'm getting in trouble.
5263900	5270780	Let me eat the cookies. I have cookies. I have cookies. I'll eat this. I'll eat this.
5271580	5280700	What the? Isn't this supposed to be like a a flap? Oh, you peel it like this.
5282540	5293660	Cool. Okay. That's my acacia slice. I sat on them so I broke them. I accidentally sat on them.
5293660	5296540	I forgot I put them in my in my in my chair.
5323820	5328540	Free ASMR.
5331580	5334540	It should have been me. It's not fair.
5339900	5340540	It should have been me.
5340540	5341420	It should have been me.
5351180	5357420	Nani water. Hang on. It should have been me. Not him.
5370860	5377420	Well, was that a good impersonation?
5377420	5393740	All right. I ate a cookie. There you go.
5398700	5401660	I ate a cookie and got any milk with those cookies? I do.
5408380	5412780	Yeah, I got milk. Got milk. Yeah.

5490460	5496220	They're yummy. I have a really big sweet tooth and a salty tooth. I don't know if you call it a salty tooth.
5497420	5505020	I really like salt, salty foods, like really, really salty foods. I have a slim gym addiction.
5505020	5517980	Oh my god, I have HD bad. Like, we were talking about one thing and then we go to another and then to another and then to another and then to another, we never stay on topic.
5519980	5521980	I

5535340	5538380	I know I'm gonna say this tea wrong and

5727940	5754980	I can't have gluten, I can't have gluten.

5807020	5809020	How could you not?
5809020	5811020	How could you not?
5811020	5813020	It's like a curse.
5813020	5827020	All my favorite foods consist of milk and sugar.
5827020	5829020	I just have to be careful.
5829020	5835020	And so I know someone asked me about what kind of milk I like.
5835020	5843020	And I've been drinking almond milk, but I think I might have a slight peanut allergy,
5843020	5844020	but I'm not sure.
5844020	5854020	So I'm going to go take a test to go find out soon.
5854020	5856020	Almond milk is so good though.
5856020	5861020	I did the sweetened one though, and I didn't realize that there was a sweetened version,
5861020	5874020	and I grabbed that without looking, brought that home, drunk that, and then died the next day.
5874020	5875020	It was bad.
5875020	5877020	It was my stomach.
5878020	5880020	It was so bad.
5885020	5887020	What happened?
5887020	5889020	What's going on?
5889020	5892020	Why does it hurt so bad?
5892020	5895020	Help, help me.
5904020	5916020	I've never had rice milk before, or oat milk before, and I want to try it.
5916020	5918020	I want to try it.
5918020	5925020	So maybe I'll try it out on another Zazzledon stream, or just chatting the stream like now,
5925020	5928020	until you guess how I feel about it.
5929020	5932020	I hope you guys have like brands.
5932020	5933020	I need brands.
5933020	5934020	I need the fine ones.
5934020	5936020	Find the best ones.
5937020	5941020	I can drink and stuff.
5949020	5951020	Milk sampling stream.
5951020	5952020	Yeah!
5952020	5954020	All kinds of milk.
5959020	5964020	I think rice milk.
5964020	5974020	Don't they use rice milk or just rice to make rice wine or something like that?
5974020	5980020	Or am I like having a moment right now?
5980020	5982020	Cause I don't know.
5988020	5990020	Yeah, sake.
5995020	5997020	Yeah, sake.
6000020	6001020	Is it just rice?
6001020	6006020	I thought they put rice milk in it as well.
6006020	6011020	Or is that just different brands of sake that do different things?
6011020	6013020	Or am I just...
6014020	6018020	I've only had sake once.
6018020	6020020	One time.
6020020	6024020	And on the menu, it was called rice wine.
6024020	6025020	So...
6028020	6030020	That was the first time I had sake.
6030020	6032020	And I don't remember...
6033020	6035020	Don't remember...
6036020	6040020	What it tasted like.
6043020	6046020	Because before that, I was drinking a lot of soju.
6046020	6049020	I was kind of drunk that day.
6050020	6052020	I was drinking a lot of soju.
6052020	6055020	I was a really, really big drunk that day.
6059020	6064020	And then we visited like Korean barbecue.
6064020	6066020	Korean barbecue.
6066020	6068020	Korean barbecue.
6074020	6077020	It's not a vibe.
6077020	6080020	It's not that scary.
6080020	6082020	But she's just hot.
6084020	6086020	She gets really strict when she needs to.
6086020	6089020	I might do later on down the line.
6089020	6091020	I could see it happening.
6104020	6107020	So, I wanted to say that...
6111020	6115020	To go over all the sick stuff that I've mentioned so far.
6115020	6119020	If you can remember all the things I just listed.
6119020	6122020	Because there was all over the place, I'm sorry.
6124020	6130020	In order to keep up with my health, I have to do a bit of exercise.
6130020	6135020	I'm gonna keep myself nice and fat.
6135020	6138020	Nice and fat.
6142020	6144020	I forgot.
6148020	6151020	Which is what gave me the idea.
6151020	6155020	To do ASMR workout streams.
6155020	6160020	Where I whisper and tell you guys where to go.
6160020	6164020	And we exercise together.
6180020	6183020	So, we could do my workouts together.
6183020	6186020	So, I have to do things like yoga.
6186020	6189020	And keep my arm strength up.
6189020	6192020	To handle my shoulder issue.
6192020	6194020	And my neck issue.
6194020	6199020	Because if the rest of my body can't hold up my own big old head.
6202020	6205020	I had to make it all strong.
6208020	6212020	I had to make it all strong to help with that pain.
6212020	6214020	My doctors are yelling at me.
6214020	6216020	You need to get stronger.
6216020	6218020	Stronger. Worked out.
6218020	6220020	Unfit.
6220020	6222020	So, I had to do that.
6224020	6226020	Pits just arrived.
6227020	6229020	I'm so jealous.
6231020	6232020	So, yeah.
6232020	6235020	So, with all the food I'm eating and stuff.
6235020	6237020	Can go to...
6238020	6241020	The rest of my body.
6245020	6247020	And I cannot...
6248020	6250020	You know.
6251020	6254020	Be a big, big, big strong.
6268020	6271020	So, those streams will probably be...
6271020	6273020	I don't...
6273020	6276020	I think those will be streams here on YouTube.
6276020	6279020	If I'm able to.
6279020	6282020	Because I'm not sure if I...
6282020	6285020	Those would be okay to do.
6285020	6288020	Maybe we could like test the waters.
6288020	6291020	But I'd have to see how Stroni feels about that.
6292020	6294020	And then...
6294020	6296020	Um...
6299020	6303020	I know a lot of people really want me to do...
6303020	6305020	Like the...
6306020	6309020	The hypnosis stuff.
6309020	6311020	And the...
6313020	6315020	Extreme dummy stuff.
6315020	6317020	Or be extreme dumb.
6317020	6319020	I think I covered some of that.
6319020	6323020	But I don't think I'm going to be taking over any of the girls.
6323020	6324020	Other girls' roles.
6324020	6326020	That's their thing.
6326020	6328020	That's what they do.
6328020	6330020	And...
6330020	6332020	I would have to discuss...
6332020	6334020	Maybe some...
6336020	6338020	Things...
6338020	6342020	With my gen mates to see how they feel about it.
6343020	6345020	Maybe collabs or something.
6345020	6348020	A little collab here and there.
6348020	6350020	You know?
6351020	6353020	I like to be vague.
6353020	6356020	I don't like telling you guys anything.
6356020	6359020	I know everyone else is really sharing with you.
6359020	6361020	On what everyone's doing.
6361020	6364020	But I like to surprise people.
6364020	6367020	I really like to stay on the download.
6367020	6369020	And I go...
6370020	6372020	I did a thing.
6372020	6374020	Do you see it?
6374020	6376020	Are you looking at it?
6376020	6378020	Do you like it?
6381020	6384020	I don't like sharing.
6384020	6386020	I like the mystery.
6386020	6387020	It's fun.
6387020	6389020	And I love seeing all your reactions.
6389020	6391020	When it does come out.
6391020	6393020	Where everyone freaks out.
6393020	6396020	Talking about how I'm hiding my true powers.
6396020	6398020	I've seen the morows.
6398020	6402020	I got quite a few morows about the shock.
6406020	6408020	I bide my time and wait.
6408020	6410020	To surprise you.
6411020	6413020	Mystery milk.
6424020	6426020	So there are things in the work.
6426020	6429020	And there are things that are being planned out.
6429020	6432020	And it caters quite a lot.
6432020	6435020	To a lot of the things that were asked for.
6435020	6437020	Some of the...
6437020	6440020	A lot of the things that were asked for.
6449020	6451020	So you won't have to worry about a thing.
6451020	6453020	It's probably gonna be there.
6453020	6455020	Most likely.
6457020	6459020	But will I say it is?
6459020	6471020	So if anyone wants to know about any of the saucier stuff.
6471020	6474020	ASMRs and stuff that's most likely gonna be on the Patreon.
6474020	6476020	You'll find it.
6476020	6478020	In the description.
6479020	6482020	If anyone else wants to send me more morows.
6482020	6484020	That's also in the description.
6485020	6489020	Is that what you call?
6489020	6491020	Did I do that right?
6493020	6495020	Did I do that right?
6498020	6500020	I do like teasing.
6500020	6502020	It's fun.
6507020	6508020	Yes!
6508020	6509020	Mertz 2.
6509020	6510020	Mertz 2.
6510020	6512020	Also in the description.
6512020	6514020	No, just sleep under your chair.
6514020	6515020	My ears.
6515020	6517020	You wanna see one of my ears?
6517020	6519020	Please, thank you.
6520020	6522020	Are they nice and fluffy?
6524020	6526020	Are they really soft?
6526020	6528020	You wanna touch them?
6529020	6532020	Wanna wrap them around you like a blanket?
6535020	6537020	I'm gonna get on to the merch very soon.
6537020	6540020	I was going to save that for last.
6540020	6543020	Okay, we'll talk about that soon.
6543020	6546020	Thank you for the reminder.
6547020	6551020	I have a list of things to talk to you guys about.
6551020	6553020	We're gonna talk about this.
6553020	6554020	We're gonna talk about this.
6554020	6555020	And then this.
6555020	6556020	And then this.
6556020	6558020	And then we just spend hours talking about anime.
6570020	6572020	I don't think I...
6572020	6574020	I'm not really...
6574020	6576020	I'm really bad at using the moral.
6576020	6578020	The marshmallow.
6578020	6580020	The moral.
6580020	6582020	I'm really bad at using it.
6582020	6586020	So I don't know how to post things.
6588020	6590020	I'm so sorry.
6590020	6591020	It's like...
6591020	6595020	It's my first time using this thing.
6595020	6599020	So I'm slowly figuring things out.
6599020	6601020	So...
6603020	6604020	What's that?
6604020	6606020	The moral is the marshmallow.
6606020	6609020	Where you can ask me questions there.
6609020	6611020	And usually I will answer your questions there.
6611020	6615020	Or send it to you via there.
6615020	6618020	So you can send me stuff in there.
6618020	6620020	And you know.
6624020	6627020	I'm like old.
6627020	6629020	Says you.
6629020	6631020	Says you.
6631020	6633020	Gotta speaking.

6640020	6642020	You know?
6642020	6644020	Been around for a long, really long time.
6644020	6645020	You know?
6645020	6646020	Yeah.
6646020	6647020	Uh...

6668020	6669020	That's it.
6669020	6670020	That's it.
6670020	6671020	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6671020	6672020	Understand.
6672020	6673020	That's good.
6673020	6674020	Yeah, yeah.
6674020	6675020	Yee-haw.
6677020	6678020	Guess what?
6678020	6679020	Those are good.
6679020	6680020	Sorry.
6680020	6681020	Sorry.
6681020	6683020	You could just...
6683020	6684020	You could like...
6684020	6687020	There's like a permanent translate.
6687020	6688020	Like...
6688020	6689020	I think...
6689020	6690020	There's a permanent...
6690020	6691020	You could add...
6691020	6694020	You could put a permanent Google translate.
6694020	6696020	At the top.
6696020	6698020	It pops up for me.
6698020	6699020	You could like put a permanent...
6699020	6700020	Like a little...
6700020	6701020	Little thingy.
6701020	6702020	Little thingy.
6702020	6704020	And it translates it for you.
6705020	6708020	Just hit random buttons until it works.
6713020	6720020	That's about it, kind of you.
6720020	6729020	We're riding away to the sunset with this one.
6729020	6739020	I don't know if I should say...
6739020	6754020	Yeah, I don't know if I should say...
6754020	6764020	I know a lot of people are wondering what my accent is.
6764020	6776020	I heard some cries about my accent and not being able to figure it out.
6776020	6785020	But I'm not Aussie though.
6785020	6788020	Keep the accent a mystery?
6788020	6789020	Sure, I can do that.
6789020	6796020	But what I can tell you is this.
6796020	6798020	I am not Dutch.
6798020	6800020	No, I'm learning Dutch.
6800020	6807020	I've traveled to the Netherlands before, I think last year.
6807020	6809020	And it was fun.
6809020	6813020	So, I'm learning Dutch.
6813020	6817020	Dutch, Dutch, Dutch, Dutch, Dutch.
6817020	6819020	Alright, so I'm going to tell you.
6819020	6824020	I don't speak various languages.
6824020	6831020	But I was raised around various communities.
6831020	6833020	And...
6833020	6835020	What do you call it?
6843020	6846020	So what do you want it?
6846020	6863020	Yes, I was raised around a lot of ethnic groups.
6863020	6874020	She's just turning to her roots.
6874020	6881020	Thank you.
6881020	6883020	Oh, my bleeding heart.
6883020	6888020	That's so cute.
6888020	6894020	That's so cute.
6894020	6900020	I like that so much.
6900020	6907020	But when I was younger, I was raised around a lot of people who spoke Spanish.
6907020	6910020	A lot of people who spoke Spanish.
6910020	6913020	I don't speak the language.
6913020	6921020	A lot of them were Mexican and Puerto Rican.
6921020	6926020	So I was raised around a lot of people who spoke Spanish for a long time.
6926020	6932020	So I don't speak Spanish, but because they spoke to me in Spanish a lot and never in English,
6932020	6935020	I had to learn to understand Spanish.
6935020	6942020	I'm not good at it now, but I was really good at it before where they would talk to me, have a conversation in Spanish,
6942020	6945020	and I would just do or respond in English.
6945020	6949020	So I cannot read Spanish.
6949020	6955020	I can't read it. I can't do that. I'm sorry.
6955020	6965020	And then as I got older, I was raised around a lot of people who spoke Japanese and Korean and Mandarin.
6965020	6976020	I met a lot of people who came overseas to visit where I live, and they spoke Japanese.
6976020	6981020	So I learned a lot from them when I was younger.
6981020	6983020	I just so happened to be interested in anime.
6983020	6988020	So a lot of people used to be like, oh, you want to be trying to do that.
6988020	6990020	You want to be, want to be, want to be.
6990020	6993020	It's whatever. I don't care.
6993020	7007020	But I was friends with a lot of people who were Asian, so I just picked up a lot of their manualisms.
7007020	7016020	I picked up a lot of their manualisms, and I started learning Korean and Japanese back then.
7016020	7019020	No, not Cantonese, but Tengalong.
7019020	7021020	And Tengalong.
7021020	7028020	I knew some people who spoke Tengalong, which I think is the Philippines.
7028020	7033020	Filipino. I was friends with a lot of Filipinos.
7034020	7046020	And then as I got older, as I got older, I was friends with a lot of people who spoke Russian.
7046020	7067020	I didn't travel. I didn't go anywhere. I just happened to meet these people.
7067020	7069020	I was just surrounded by these people.
7069020	7073020	You know how you meet one person, and then they introduce you to their group of friends,
7073020	7077020	and their whole group of friends speak that one language, but you, you're the only one?
7077020	7082020	I was always the one person in the group that spoke only English.
7082020	7085020	That was me. I was that person.
7085020	7095020	I was always the one person in every group, so just the one person that didn't speak the language.
7095020	7098020	I was that one person.
7104020	7109020	So, yeah.
7109020	7116020	So I met a bunch of people who spoke Russian, and then they started teaching me Russian, and they started teaching me.
7116020	7126020	And they started, like, talking about it and doing that and doing this, and I was like, oh, yeah, it's cool, it's cool.
7126020	7136020	And then there was some people in the group who were Swedish and Poland.
7136020	7144020	And so they started teaching me some of the things that they say, some of the words they say, and Swedish and Poland, and I was like, oh, cool, cool, cool.
7144020	7147020	I started learning that for, like, a year.
7147020	7152020	But of course, nothing sticks because I'm dumb.
7152020	7160020	Nothing ever sticks. I'm interested in it for a little while, and then I just kind of, like, since I have no one to talk to in that language, it's gone.
7160020	7162020	It's gone.
7162020	7184020	And then after that, after that, I started learning Dutch, yeah.
7184020	7190020	And then I actually left for the first time ever to go to the Netherlands.
7190020	7202020	That was my first time ever leaving my country.
7202020	7208020	That was my first time. I've never left it before, so I was excited.
7208020	7214020	It was very scary, but it was really fun.
7214020	7221020	I was very happy, and I had a lot of fun. I ate a lot of food, and it was really fun.
7221020	7223020	Would I go again? Yes.
7223020	7234020	I want to travel more. It's like my biggest dream, because with my health, I was scared that I wasn't going to be able to do that.
7234020	7240020	To travel and stuff, because my health is, like, really bad.
7240020	7246020	So I was very happy to travel for the first time ever.
7246020	7251020	And when I got my passport, I was so excited. I cried.
7251020	7253020	I got emotional.
7254020	7259020	I was crying.
7262020	7266020	It was good. It was good. It was fun. I had a fun time.
7273020	7274020	Okay.
7284020	7289020	Oh, thank you.
7289020	7294020	Oh, thank you.
7300020	7304020	Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
7304020	7306020	I'm so sorry.
7307020	7311020	We're fine. We're fine.
7314020	7317020	I'm a big strong girl.
7317020	7320020	I don't cry.
7320020	7324020	Crying. I don't do that.
7327020	7330020	We don't cry here.
7336020	7340020	We're fine.
7344020	7347020	More.
7347020	7349020	Why?
7349020	7352020	But yeah.
7353020	7362020	But the last thing on this thread I wanted to mention was fan art.
7362020	7375020	I'm okay with any fan art, as long as it's not, you know, the, you know, that word down there.
7376020	7379020	As long as it's not done, we're fine.
7379020	7382020	Please and thank you.
7384020	7387020	Draw what you want. Draw what you will.
7387020	7392020	Anything goes. I don't care on paper, little doodles.
7392020	7395020	I don't care. Art is art. There's not just anything as bad art.
7395020	7398020	I don't care what it looks like.
7398020	7401020	Let me share it with the world.
7401020	7404020	I really like art. I'm an artist myself.
7404020	7408020	I draw too, but I'm a lazy artist.
7408020	7413020	So you only get flat colors and messy sketches from me.
7413020	7421020	I do draw really detailed stuff sometimes, but I have really bad.
7421020	7429020	I have a zone that I get into and I can draw for hours.
7429020	7432020	I remember drawing for like 24 hours.
7432020	7436020	I didn't eat. I didn't sleep.
7436020	7438020	I didn't use the bathroom.
7438020	7443020	I don't know what happened. It was like a zone. I was in a zone.
7443020	7453020	And I went into extreme details on the art that I drew and I was like going in and I'm like, yeah.
7453020	7459020	And if I stop, I can never get that back and draw what was ever on my mind.
7459020	7465020	And then I get like stuck and I can't finish the piece and it goes undone forever.
7465020	7471020	So I get in a zone and I can't really leave it.
7471020	7476020	So that's why I only doodle like sketches and I try to leave it at that.
7476020	7480020	I do a doodle and I throw a little color in there and I leave it.
7480020	7485020	Or it's just the doodle when I go like I did. I posted this.
7485020	7493020	So yeah.
7493020	7500020	Yeah, I'm trying to keep you guys here for as long as possible.
7500020	7508020	I'll give you company until you see your little sharp friend.
7508020	7514020	I was going to keep this so short, but I don't know. I don't know what happened.
7514020	7520020	I don't know what happened. We just started rounding about everything.
7520020	7528020	This is supposed to be like a super short stream.
7528020	7531020	I'm supposed to be so short.
7531020	7536020	But I'm rambling. Oh gosh. Am I the apper?
7536020	7546020	Am I the apper?
7546020	7560020	Time does fly when you're having fun. It's true. I agree.
7560020	7566020	Okay.
7566020	7573020	Speaking Japanese.
7573020	7579020	Am I the endurance streamer from the company? Oh my gosh.
7579020	7584020	Oh.
7584020	7589020	I did it.
7589020	7595020	Oh.
7595020	7600020	Sorry.
7600020	7604020	The voice is pretty enough. I'm going to say thank you.
7605020	7610020	I really don't understand. You guys like my voice.
7610020	7615020	Even Amy brought it up earlier and she was talking about it.
7615020	7619020	She was conscious of her voice. I think her voice is so cute.
7619020	7622020	I wish I could have a voice like hers.
7622020	7628020	It's just soft.
7628020	7631020	I think it's so cute.
7631020	7638020	It's so cute.
7638020	7643020	And same goes for Icy's voice. Icy's voice is so cute.
7643020	7648020	The small bien. The super small bien.
7648020	7653020	I'm going to smush both of them.
7653020	7658020	Smush them to their pop.
7658020	7666020	Everyone's voice is so good.
7666020	7672020	She's beginning to feel like a yep god.
7672020	7678020	A minimum reference.
7678020	7682020	I never really got to talk about my music taste.
7682020	7686020	It's a...
7686020	7690020	Everyone has a taste. A specific genre of music.
7690020	7697020	But I don't actually listen to extreme, huge range of music.
7697020	7703020	When I was younger, I used to be in a choir.
7703020	7707020	An advanced choir. So I sung songs a lot.
7707020	7711020	Choir like opera.
7711020	7714020	It's late.
7714020	7717020	It's a little bit you get.
7717020	7721020	You used to sing opera?
7721020	7725020	I don't want it to be too loud for the microphone.
7725020	7728020	I'm scared I'm going to blow your ears off.
7728020	7732020	When I sing like that, it gets really loud.
7732020	7737020	I used to listen to all sorts of music.
7737020	7741020	Classical rap.
7741020	7745020	K-pop. Japanese songs.
7745020	7749020	Japanese rock. Japanese pop.
7749020	7753020	Regular pop.
7753020	7757020	So many things. I listen to Mandarin songs.
7757020	7760020	Rock.
7760020	7763020	Metal. I really like metal.
7763020	7767020	Mose. They're fun too.
7767020	7771020	I listen to quite a bit.
7771020	7775020	I would call it a bit of everything.
7775020	7779020	We never do karaoke streams.
7779020	7783020	I want to. I do.
7783020	7787020	I do. I do. I do.
7787020	7791020	But since it's like...
7791020	7795020	Since I usually end up singing randomly on stream.
7795020	7799020	Just randomly out of the blue.
7799020	7803020	I get a little nervous.
7803020	7807020	When it comes to prepping for a karaoke stream. What songs are loud?
7807020	7811020	What can I pick? What can I sing?
7811020	7815020	You know how I get in trouble?
7815020	7819020	I'm nervous. I don't want to get in trouble.
7819020	7823020	So I don't know what songs to pick. I don't know what is appropriate.
7823020	7827020	You know, the YouTubes.
7827020	7831020	Don't come for me.
7831020	7835020	Bunk me upside the head and go dumb goat.
7835020	7839020	I'm so sorry.
7843020	7847020	I have a big range of music. I listen to a lot of anime.
7847020	7851020	Openings and songs. Opening and endings. I don't really skip them.
7851020	7855020	Because I like music. Music is like...
7855020	7859020	It speaks to me. It's my heart.
7859020	7863020	I get emotional when it comes to anime and music.
7863020	7867020	It's my heart. It's what I was raised for. For a long time.
7867020	7871020	So if lyrics suddenly start... If I start finally paying attention.
7871020	7875020	Usually you listen to a song and you never really...
7875020	7879020	You say you don't like the song. But then like a year later or two.
7879020	7883020	You listen to the lyrics and now you're like
7883020	7887020	What? Wow. This really hits me this time.
7887020	7891020	I like this. And now all of a sudden the song is your favorite.
7891020	7895020	After hitting on it for like a couple of years.
7895020	7899020	I kind of go through that quite often.
7905020	7909020	I'm crying in my room.
7913020	7917020	You feel the song but never learn it. This is true.
7917020	7921020	This is very true. I either feel the song, never learn it.
7921020	7925020	Or hate the song. Don't bother to learn it.
7925020	7929020	End up liking it.
7929020	7933020	Or just... Or like a song
7933020	7937020	So much that it's the... That like...
7937020	7941020	You have to play this song every day. Every day you go outside.
7941020	7945020	Play that song. Or repeat. Not stop.
7945020	7949020	I have songs like that. Where I like
7949020	7953020	listen to the song over and over and over again.
7953020	7957020	It might be a little acoustic there.
7957020	7961020	And that record.
7961020	7965020	Um...
7965020	7969020	Uh oh.
7969020	7973020	Oh here we go. Okay chat like
7973020	7977020	froze for me for a second.
7977020	7981020	I couldn't even read chat.
7981020	7985020	The heck?
7985020	7989020	Sorry about that.
7989020	7993020	I'll just stop moving.
7993020	7997020	There we go.
7997020	8001020	Uh oh. Uh oh. I used to love Scooby-Doo.
8001020	8005020	This was good stuff. Scooby-Doo was great.
8009020	8013020	Now chat's back. You're back. Don't worry. It's fixed.
8013020	8017020	It's fixed. You're live. You're live. You're live.
8017020	8021020	You're back. You're back.
8027020	8031020	Do I like plays? Does that mean I like plays as well? Sometimes.
8031020	8035020	I am... I can't really... I have a hard time
8035020	8039020	focusing. So if the music isn't really catchy. Or like
8039020	8043020	pulls me in.
8043020	8047020	I'll... I'll... I'll probably fall asleep.
8047020	8051020	If I'm honest. I'll probably fall asleep.
8051020	8055020	I'll probably fall asleep.
8055020	8059020	If it's like long winded speech plays
8059020	8063020	like where they're just talking. I'll probably fall asleep. I usually wake up
8063020	8067020	but I used to go to plays a lot and I would wake up when they start singing.
8067020	8071020	It would always be when they're singing where I will wake up.
8071020	8075020	When the moment they start like, she did this. What?
8075020	8079020	Oh my god. And then I'm just like...
8089020	8093020	But if it's all music? Probably. I'll probably pay attention to it.
8093020	8097020	I've seen Hamilton before I believe.
8097020	8101020	So yeah.
8101020	8105020	If it's all music I'll probably... I'll probably
8105020	8109020	have a good watch. A good listen.
8109020	8113020	Because I can clap along like, yay!
8113020	8117020	Yay!
8117020	8121020	And if it's a song I know, I'll sing along.
8127020	8131020	Okay.
8147020	8151020	I don't know what that was.
8151020	8155020	Are there more slides?
8155020	8159020	Yeah. I was going to go over the goals again
8159020	8163020	but we already did that and we ignored that.
8163020	8167020	Oh yeah! Oh my god!
8175020	8179020	Oh my god I can believe we forgot!
8179020	8183020	I...
8183020	8187020	I...
8187020	8191020	I...
8191020	8195020	I'm so sorry. I'm just going so fast
8195020	8199020	and I... I... I...
8199020	8203020	I'm so sorry. I'm so distracted.
8203020	8207020	Mama forgot. Yeah, she forgot.

8211020	8215020	for some tags so I had some. And I wanted to see
8215020	8219020	if you guys could come up with some as we went. So if any of you had

8749420	8753420	it doesn't look
8753420	8759420	but like it's been used recently
8759420	8765420	so, I think we're free
8765420	8767420	free to use doolive
8767420	8769420	alright, doolive it is
8769420	8777420	next we'll do the next one
8777420	8783420	we have the clips, which is the daily doolay
8783420	8789420	I have daily doolay
8789420	8795420	and what else?
8795420	8799420	I have daily doolay
8799420	8801420	what was it?
8801420	8815420	or your other ideas for our clips?
8815420	8819420	milky moments, no, I don't think I can use that
8819420	8823420	there are other creators with that name
8823420	8827420	so I don't want to
8827420	8831420	take that
8831420	8837420	azuclips
8837420	8843420	sounds nice, I like that
8843420	8845420	I don't think I should use anything with goat in it
8845420	8851420	because there's like a bunch of other, you know, goats like myself
8851420	8855420	so, very sure
8855420	8859420	I want it to be like
8859420	8863420	kind of obvious it's mine
8863420	8867420	that's our goat
8875420	8877420	doolay clips
8877420	8879420	I'll add a third option
8879420	8889420	and I think that's the last one and you guys will have to pick from that, okay?
8889420	8893420	alright, starting pull now
8893420	8895420	which ones do you like?
8895420	8897420	which ones do you want?

8907420	8911420	scratch, scratch, scratch
8923420	8925420	I'll wait a little bit
8925420	8929420	little bit, little bit
8929420	8933420	scratch, scratch, scratch
8953420	8957420	and I think that
8957420	8959420	50, 50
8959420	8963420	it's like at a hard 50
8963420	8965420	let's count down from 3
8965420	8971420	3, 2, 1
8971420	8975420	and 0, we end the pull
8983420	8985420	what, 1?
8985420	8989420	it was no 50, I was wrong, I was off
8989420	8995420	it only showed me 1

10281260	10285140	They asked me if I could not ignore it. I say management is awesome
10286620	10290140	They work really hard to get everyone's stuff done and they
10291220	10295900	Get it done very quickly, and I think it's that's pretty cool, and they're very
10296940	10298940	How do you say?
10299380	10301020	understanding
10301060	10303060	very understanding and I
10303660	10309260	Appreciate that. I feel very welcomed and wanted and I really love it here already
10309260	10312860	And I hope it will continue to be the best
10313620	10315620	experience it can be
10316300	10319700	So far so please I really love this
10321100	10323100	Company so much already
10324100	10331140	I mean son has been very helpful the manager son has been very very very helpful and very good at what they do
10336540	10340820	All my mistakes were on me if I'm really honest I did make a
10341260	10346820	Trying to like fix stuff at PC issues. I had so many issues going on
10347740	10352460	The person who helped me out with all of that was means and manager
10354100	10357860	Manager help me out so much with everything so
10360300	10362300	I'm not a very tech savvy
10363220	10365220	so I
10365980	10368820	Appreciate that that hope that I got it was very necessary
10371540	10373820	So yeah, that's all I feel
10377460	10379460	The next question
10379980	10381980	Hello, that's debut
10383180	10390020	My question is have you met your gen maids in your life or have you only the chance to meet them online?
10390340	10393980	Also, what is your first impression on them? I've given my impression on them
10394820	10397460	very shortly during the deal and I
10398460	10400460	Really love them so much
10400660	10402660	They make me feel very
10404100	10406100	At home
10406740	10407900	I
10407900	10411780	Do get kind of nervous around them, and I've heard that I'm quite
10412540	10421820	Intimidating so I hope that we can warm up even more as time goes and we've done played games together already
10423220	10429460	Thank you saying I was really good at the game, but I just I don't know I I I I was just
10430340	10433020	Normally playing said games and enjoying it
10433020	10435020	So
10436380	10440540	I'm just very observant and I like to like pick out things I see it
10464020	10465020	I
10465020	10471420	Hopefully we'll warm up a little more and no I have not met them in real life yet, but maybe one day we will
10473580	10475580	And I hope that
10475940	10479460	That comes to the past and I really do want to meet my gen maids
10479460	10484820	I think it'd be really fun like going to conventions or cons together our events and stuff as
10485620	10487620	us
10488780	10490780	As me
10491660	10499620	And stuff like that and maybe even stream like in person together. That'd be fun, but yeah, I think what
10499620	10501620	And
10515380	10518900	Okay, I wouldn't be a surprised if you're getting other
10522660	10524660	So here's something
10524660	10531220	I would love comfort sleep ASMR just coming breathing heartbeat, maybe some comforting speech for me, you know, whatever
10531860	10533860	I just like the idea
10535980	10540020	Interaction so far. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to the baby. Oh
10541220	10542620	What's to come?
10542620	10546140	Yes, actually, this is something that I've always wanted to do
10546140	10550820	I think I've mentioned it in the debut where I said I wanted to do sleep ASMR
10551820	10557800	He obeyed or I either sing you a lullaby read you a bedtime story or like just
10558380	10564700	Babble to you about something and comfort you like it's okay. You could sleep. It's fine
10565820	10573060	Nina little head pad. I've had your head with some ASMR sounds of me cuddling or petting you
10573500	10578060	Things like that, you know and healthy sleep. I wanted to do things like like that
10581780	10588300	The heartbeat breathing all of that all of it. I want to do all of that comfort comfort ASMR
10593820	10599620	So I want to just bring that up so I that you all know what kind of content to expect from me
10599620	10601300	Maybe in the future
10601300	10606540	But the majority of the time is yes, I am a gamer. I am a gamer. I play a lot of games. I
10608100	10610100	Don't think I'll
10611820	10613820	Don't think I'll be
10618700	10623540	Streaming a lot of league League of Legends. Yes, I said I like league and yes
10623540	10628500	I said I like playing league, but do not expect me to play league. Um, I
10628940	10630940	Don't think I'm going to play it
10634740	10636740	So yeah
10637420	10641900	So I brought up league early, but I forgot to mention that I wasn't gonna play it
10645100	10650900	There might be a random time when like if I have free time and I have a and I do a random morning
10650900	10658100	Stream that I plan at the time or something if it's a morning stream. Oh, I probably might be bored and
10659300	10665860	Choose to stream some league just like hey, there's a random league stream if anyone wants to come you're free to come
10665860	10668740	It's fine. I understand a lot of people don't like league, but
10671460	10675860	League is my comfort game league is a game that I actually enjoy that helps me like
10677140	10683140	With racing thoughts. So I play league. I don't have to stream it. I could play it off stream
10683860	10685860	So it doesn't need to be streamed
10687940	10689940	It's just uh
10689940	10694580	A thing that I like to play and I thought that sharing my interest is better than um
10695460	10697460	Just you know, yeah
10700420	10704820	Everyone has a comfort game. I hear some people have apex legends as their comfort game
10705140	10709860	People have shooting games of their comfort game. I can have mine. Come on. Come on
10710740	10712740	Come on
10714580	10716580	League isn't that bad
10717540	10719540	I
10722580	10727220	Understand their concerns of how Lee can be a bit not comforting
10736340	10741380	Worry odds that you will do a total gen one collab like all of us collabing together
10741940	10743940	There's a high chance for that
10744580	10746580	It's pretty high
10747620	10753140	I thought we would never not do it. So all of us clubbing together. Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty high
10754500	10756500	It's pretty pretty it's pretty pretty high
10763540	10767860	Technically, yeah, technically, I'll redone one. Yeah, right. It has happened before. Yeah
10769860	10771860	It's pretty high
10772580	10774580	Um, and we have
10776260	10780980	This one's not that bad, right? It's not that bad. I'm not that bad. It's not that bad, all right
10781540	10785060	Well, mommy enjoys being a sub too, right? I'm sort of being a sub
10787460	10789460	Encouraging, you know
10789780	10791780	Though I have bad kids so sometimes
10792420	10795140	I already mentioned this before that. Yes
10796500	10800900	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I cater to quite a lot of things and
10801540	10803540	You should expect both
10804340	10806340	So not at all
10821060	10825780	She been everyone and Emmy and everyone has been talking about what they want to do and the things that they will do
10826420	10827540	um
10827540	10829540	That's fine. I don't mind
10830260	10832260	Uh it at all. Um
10832900	10834900	I'm going to do what I like regardless
10835220	10837220	um, and that has always been my plan
10837540	10842420	And I do not mind. I'm fine with that. It's perfectly fine. Um
10844100	10848820	Besides, I think I already fit the vibes already. So I don't think that's a problem
10849700	10851700	Oh

10864500	10866500	I like mama asu
