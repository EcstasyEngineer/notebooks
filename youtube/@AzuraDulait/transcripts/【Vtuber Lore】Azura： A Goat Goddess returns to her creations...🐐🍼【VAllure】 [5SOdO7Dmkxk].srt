1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,840
The earth was juvenile, barren in its infancy, then from dust and darkness, the lifeless

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:18,160
silence was broken, the crust of the earth cracked and moored, and from the bed of creation

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,880
within it rose the first family.

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,480
Upon seeing the empty earth, they used the immeasurable power within themselves to form

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,120
beauty in an empty canvas of the land.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:38,880
They lit the sky with stars, pulled the mountains from the ground, and filled craters with oceans.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,720
Among the divines, the sister Azira would colour the land's invertency, fill the blue

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:51,680
oceans with life, and instil within these creations the potential to grow and repopulate.

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,760
In her accomplishment, she would be known as the Goddess of Fertility.

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,880
In time, Azira's creations would grow in intellect and complexity.

11
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,920
From their scattered tribes, the gods took to guiding humanity with their superior knowledge.

12
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,160
In this exchange, humanity gave them worship and devotion, the gods would shape the foundations

13
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:21,880
of human civilization across the land in each celebrating their divine benefactor.

14
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,880
The gods, confident that mankind could stand on their own, sought to create the heavens,

15
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,680
a place where the gods could raise families of their own kind, as earth was no space for

16
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,180
them to grow.

17
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,480
They rightfully seeked the same prosperity that they offered for their own and left.

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:45,040
Out of all the gods, it was Azira who could not leave humanity.

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,860
She loved her creations, yet she also loved the gods.

20
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:57,720
She left a piece of her divinity with her family in remembrance and remained on earth

21
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:05,280
to live among humanity, not as a ruler, but as a watcher and caretaker.

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,320
It would be after the gods departure that the long peace would end.

23
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,560
With the imbalance of power, wars between the regions could not be prevented.

24
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,640
Anger, strife, and hunger for power would taint the ego of man, and Azira's limited

25
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,640
power could not restore the will the gods had left behind for humanity.

26
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:36,240
In her perceived failure, Azira would seemingly disappear from the walks of history.

27
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,440
It has been long theorized that the goddess still lives amongst us in secret.

28
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,360
There has been a long time speculation that, throughout history, Azira has been guiding

29
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,560
humanity in small leadership roles, humanitarian efforts in philanthropy, or using her power

30
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,680
to prevent cataclysmic disasters.

31
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,000
However she is, we can all rest easy that she is watching over us from a position befitting

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,440
a goddess among men.

33
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,040
Well, Billy, I think we all learned an important lesson here today.

34
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,120
That's right, Papa.

35
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,080
Whatever happens, we're all family.

36
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,880
That's exactly right, Billy, and there's nothing more important than family.

37
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
Oh, shucks.

38
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,440
I'm so happy I have such a big happy loving family.

39
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,640
I'd be such a sucker if I didn't have a family.

40
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
Aw, Billy.

41
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,640
It has been a few years since I came to the realization that I could no longer outrun

42
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,240
the reach of mankind.

43
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:58,240
Living among animals, I tried to run from civilization for as long as time would allow.

44
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,840
I am content to play the role of a commoner among humanity, yet I am tortured still by

45
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,240
loneliness, by desires.

46
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,640
I cannot fight my needs anymore.

47
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,400
I must find my place among the humans and start a family.

48
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:24,440
In my inaugural efforts to integrate into modern society, it became clear that I lack

49
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,440
the necessary knowledge to fraternize as humans do.

50
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:37,080
With animals, it's so simple, yet with humans, my knowledge avails me no aid.

51
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,840
Again and again, I accumulated countless attempts at courting a suitable mate.

52
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,200
How could I, before my goddess of fertility, struggle in this venture?

53
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,840
Yet seeing the progress humanity has earned themselves, astounds me.

54
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,240
They have become creators in themselves, expanding upon the earth we had given them.

55
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,560
The tiny seed I had planted all those eons ago, well how it blossomed.

56
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,800
I had believed my heart broken beyond repair, but living as they do, I see now, I see now,

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,640
that they don't need the wills of higher beings to find their own happiness.

58
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,840
Perhaps this, in itself, was the will of the gods.

59
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:31,200
I see now the beauty in the human spirit, for all its ugliness and evil, but also in its kindness and community.

60
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,840
It is the dichotomy of these aspects that makes them worthy of my love.

61
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,000
I only regret not growing alongside them.

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,160
I must make up for lost time, for every kindling of my passion.

63
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:51,560
I have found, I have endless love to give, and give it a shell.

64
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,720
Any takers?
