and
Hello everyone, hello Senpai, welcome to the stream.
We're back at it again with Harvesturder.
Sorry, I'm a slightly bit late, I'm slightly bit late, I had an idle meeting.
Thank you for Griffin, for the 10 gifted, and welcome to member, member, and Iago.
Welcome to member, lord, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Rock.
Well, I can't read. How are you feeling? My arm is still itchy.
So we're going to be playing kind of, not aggressively.
Now we're going to play not that aggressively.
Are you doing better? Let me check my arm.
There's some patches that are cleared up, but there's some parts that are still pretty bumpy and gross.
And it's, yeah, I have an appointment, I have an appointment with my doctor on Monday, that's the earliest she can see me, I think.
And so we're going to check that out, but watch as like my rash goes away by Monday.
It's LB really, it's always like that, right? It's always like that, it always, it always goes away by the time you get to the appointment.
But yeah, it's been a couple of days now. This morning it was flaring up really badly.
So I had to push, put my like bedsheets and stuff to the wash, so I have no blanket today.
So I've turned on, I've turned on my streaming lights, because sometimes I don't turn them on, but today I'm turning them on, so it's extra warm in the cages and in the basement.
So we're going to continue playing, playing, I don't remember if I have anything else to say, other than I want to just double check the instructions to see if I remember it.
Oh, and I got in the new mouse, the new mouse that Senpai gifted, so now I have a mouse that actually works, and not a mouse that disconnects every moment.
So now I can like move it nice. It fits my hand too.
It fits my hand, so now I've got a nice mouse to play my point and click games.
Okay, let's see, left button to move.
I'm going to start on a puzzle, avoid cliches, crazy logical.
Okay, I think we're good.
Yeah, that was punch.
Double click to open stuff.
Okay, yeah, we're good, we're good, we're good Senpai.
So now we just have to load our last save file.
Which is Senpai, I love you, I think that's the one.
Now you can play a difficult game about climbing.
I think I was too frustrated with that.
Okay, nothing else in here.
Look at my stinking brother.
Give me the paper.
I don't want to talk to him, but he gives so much hints.
He gives so much hints.
And twitched and drew up.
I guess I got my answer.
This is why I hate you.
Hate! Hate!
Hate!
Say what?
Yeah, yeah, I said I hate you.
Yeah, my little brother.
Little brother, hate.
Little sister.
Okay, little brother, hate.
Hate, Trid.
I'm in Sparky's super foamy fire extinguisher.
A new boy in his sleeping soundly.
Hello, mother.
Hello dear, how are you today?
You know those firemen, the funny ones with the color sense.
Looks like they misplaced a bolt of expensive fabric.
Of course, each one of them suspects the other.
Looks like a cat fight is brewing.
Congratulations, hero.
You found Karen after all.
You don't seem proud, mother.
You don't seem proud, yeah.
I warned you not to waste time looking for her.
Am I running out of time?
The blood drive is coming soon.
What does that have to do with anything?
Yeah, why does that have to do with anything?
Thank you, Vincent, for remembering.
Still, I'm glad you found the poor baby.
She says Mr. Potsdam was responsible for what happened to her.
Yeah, I knew it.
I can't believe Potsdam would do something.
I believe her.
Shame on you.
Fuck you.
Imagine accusing your future father-in-law of a thing like that.
Is that how a rain-dryer would behave?
I don't think so.
Why would she lie?
Why would she lie?
Mr. Eisenheimer, even if he is a child,
molester, a kidnapper, and an attempted murderer
Molester, a kidnapper, and an attempted murderer?
What kind of father-in-law he'll be?
What?!
I just can't wait for the wedding.
What?!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean that does not affect the way he's seen as a father-in-law?
Also, Amy's not related.

Eden fix it at all oh no she's sad let's go check on her
she's a sad girl girl let's go
Stephanie I'm glad to see you I feel so alone cooped up in here
my faux mother keeps me up on the latest gossip uh-huh
not like she really wants to talk to me more like she's
feeding me information yes feed us the information for instance
she told me that mr. johnson's Tucker was vandalized uh-huh
that's another weird thing every car I've seen drive by as a Tucker
there were only 31 produced what are the odds of that I've always wanted a
Tucker funny that harvest would be full of them
any idea who scratched the car
do I tell on myself do I tell on myself senpai
don't self-snitch sure sure do it do it you want me to self-snitch myself
not like she's gonna say anything unless
do it okay I'm gonna snitch on myself
I'll snitch on myself don't trust her yeah whatever say first okay
nope I have to do it here not like anyone will believe her that's true
am I am I am I that bitch
I didn't why would you do something like that it's part of the lodge
initiation I see I see look I don't know
what's going on here but getting into the lodge is the best way to find out
by committing vandalism
oh he's mad at me for that huh that guy's a creep
kind of deserved it I mean everyone in town said he deserved it
it's a harmless enough prank by any means necessary
I thought she didn't care for the town's folk that's what I thought too
Stephanie what happened what happened the only town folk
that I care about is Karen and her mother and maybe the shopkeeper because the
shopkeeper kind of seemed sane everyone else is insane
mercy more of a any means necessary kind of go yeah just a little bit
well I guess you'll fit right in won't you
scratching a car is no big deal getting out of this mess is
sorry when you put it that way I guess I was she seemed reason
what a good good girl someone stole some fabric from them
and they're up in arms about it
do I also snitch on myself again
why would anyone steal a bolt of fabric wow
hmm should I do it yeah that was me too yeah that was me too
another harmless prank and how many more harmless pranks will you be pulling
however many it takes to get in Stephanie if I have to use them to escape
then I will are you using them or are they using you
it's just a bolt of cloth you've turned the firemen against each other
they think one of their own stole it would you rather stay here
I've heard that harvest is lovely in the fall when the leaves turn orange and
oh no our first couple bickering all right all right you have a point
is it true you found Karen yep she did yeah just in time too he molested her
and buried her he couldn't bring himself to kill her out light so he just decided
to stick her in the ground and let fate take its course who would do that to a
helpless child she says it was mr potstown and I believe her
and all this time I've been under the same roof with that
that thing watching me take it easy okay so at least he'll be coming to take him
away won't they no
oh Stephanie you mean
I can thank you well come back and visit share Stephanie
we would never bicker like that call hi don't worry oh don't worry
I have developed many many problem-solving skills
and many many many problem-solving skills and
argument mitigations and stuff so if we ever bicker senpai
don't worry about it
yeah I I can I I specialize in conflict conflict uh resolutions yeah yeah
yeah
so don't worry senpai I have it all covered don't be scared now
thank you for the memba sliceba
don't worry about anything I have everything covered
I promise nothing can go wrong
hello Steve hello Steve do you want to buy anything today yeah
just point to whatever naughty fellas like deputy lumas aside
I think every man should cultivate an interest in girly magazine
if it'll keep them out of the field of interior design
those firemen Betsy you should hear them carrying on
accusing each other of being thieves a bolt of cloth disappears you'd think it
was the end of the world
am I supposed to avoid it if they find that bolt of cloth on me damn
do I still have it note chair of checkbook
autograph vitamins tampons fire axe I still have it I still have it
I still have it I still have it I still have it so we're gonna have to save
before we go that we do anything again
look at those can I get anything can a soup or rat poisoning
mm robust kaffee kaffee
okay we're good you need to give it to the lodge
I probably do actually I probably do need to give it to the lodge
where's the lodge there it is the lodge
exquisite class exquisite class should trigger quite a bit of
dissension amongst our gallant firefighters
still that is not your concern your next assignment is to break into the
tonsorial establishment of mr. pastorelli and abscond with his prized
barber's pole
all right I've got to a scond the barber Paul
speaking of exquisite any words of the day oh yes I did think of a word of the
day are you ready are you ready senpai for the word of the day
the word of the day is lenticular
lenticular
is the printing process where they make you know if you like tilt the little
thing it's got the little ridges
where you twist you you uh
tilt it and then it like changes pictures and stuff
it's like an illusion thing yes
they can call them like a bunch of stuff yeah
spell it out I think everyone's spelling it out in chat quite well
l-e-n-t-i-c-u-l-a-r
that is today's word of the day
there's also the lenticular lenses and other different things so you're all
good
keep those in mind keep those in mind when you see when you see those
bookmarks where they change pictures you'd be like oh wow this is a lenticular
printing style
what do you think senpai is that a good word of the day
it took me a while to think of something
it took me a while to think of something but I wanted to I wanted to be like
yes here's a word or something that you might not know what it's called
but now you know
thank you for the $2 super chat go hi I lost my job I was laid off I need a hug
damn
well um
good luck senpai
good luck senpai
I'm sorry I don't know what to say other than like I'm sorry for for your loss
for your loss I hope that it leads you to a better to find a better job
with um
blackjack
and girlies
losing a job always sucks and I am no stranger to that
I'm no stranger to that I've lost
all of my jobs not not because of like any any any reason of my own other than like
other than like oh you know um my job my job like shut down or it was it was um
or they they they hired overseas uh that one sucks and and like oh it's just the end of
my um my internship so it's like oh yeah that happens right you know so there's nothing
so so it's I'm not a stranger to loss jobs or anything but you know look positively to the
future and be like yeah I'll just get another one that's better maybe I'll have more free time
and hone my craft
mysterious fire mysterious fire no nothing burned just you know they've all been quite uh
amic amicable yeah yeah my all my jobs have been like kind of like amicable
believing
um
without losing your job you wouldn't be able to lock us in cages
yeah now I have better ways of locking senpai in cages
let's see my last job was
my last job was what do you call it real estate
it was real estate
yeah scouting out locations and all those empty houses
did you find the mystical free real estate no I did not
was it fun sort of it was fun I learned a lot
I learned a lot but I definitely
wouldn't do it again oh maybe I would or maybe I would you know if the opportunity arises I
probably would do it again if like if for some reason if for some reason I cannot make a living
here or I'm not working hard enough or something I'll probably take another additional job maybe in
real estate again I learned how bad the housing market is yes I learned and I learned there are
so many people who are ridiculously rich like there's some processes where when in real estate
you know you're just kind of like they're like I want to play pay the whole the whole thing now
I'm like technically we can't sell you this without you know without some more papers
and then they go and then they go but I want to pay the whole thing right now in cash and I go
that's nice we can't do that
a full buyout yeah yeah yeah but they wanted to do in cash and that's not
it's really a lot of the pay paperwork would be way more complex than it is
and like the house that they wanted to buy was was a big house
was a big house can I say it can I say the cost of the house
anyways it's a big house it was uh
let's say it was over one million
it was a big house
and they were like I want to pay in cash and I was like
um
I can't do that I can't do that
do you get a cut of it no
no because I didn't sell to them
what exactly is wrong with paying in cash is because we need the paperwork and the paperwork
usually requires like a lot more steps than just paying out full in full cash right because you
have property and then you have the lawyer stuff and then you have bank notes and stuff and of
course you need like a line of credit blah blah blah blah blah it's a lot to buy a house
it's a lot to buy a house and it's like and title BS and then you have to like transfer transfer
titles and stuff the implication of paying on cash is that you don't do paperwork but the thing is
that like if I get paid in all cash it would be like you know people will start suspecting something
and then it will go into a whole investigation and that's another whole load of like paperwork
yeah
oh sorry I missed the two super chats oh I need to feed me herself now
I'll throw you a bone and can I stay out of the k can I stay in the cage for free now
I thought who's been paying rent should I have been charging rent for these cages
who's charging rent
the landlord me no wrong it's me
damn found out half of half of the uh half of the senpais are mysteriously gone next day
watch
okay I guess I guess if it's strongy if it's strongy then I guess that's okay
I guess it's okay
yeah strongy has been charging rent to fund VLR success
but I'm pretty sure I didn't I didn't charge rent that's why I've been saying that I'm so nice to you
no I've been paying I've been so nice to you I've been housing all my senpais in this cage
then sometimes
although if it is strongy then um I guess
I guess that it is what it is
but I saved up for a whole year to afford this one square foot cage
but yeah um gosh well I've been yapping right anyways um
it seems highly illegal and I don't want to like you know I don't want to be investigated for
for I don't know assisting a crime or something you know what I'm saying
senpai I don't want to I don't want to leave a trail I already know how to not leave a trail so
um why would I why would I accept one million cash you know
so yeah I was like okay well here's the steps you need to take before buying the house
and you know that's what I did that's what I did I uh I gave them a list of what they needed to do
before they they could buy the house and then they never bought the house
and besides one more thing one more thing and uh one more thing
we don't know if the cash is real or not it could be printed printed like you know fakes
so
yeah like you you never know right that's why you gotta be like okay well in cash
that's kind of suspect uh so I want to go through the regular avenues for this house
so I was like no no no no no no no now
mercy do your best colombo impression that was my best colombo impression
yeah I have to follow the rules the housing market is like there's a lot of rules for housing
and stuff so if I don't follow all of them I get in trouble
I get in trouble otherwise but then the rules
then the rules you can't you can't you know
you can't really just buy a house I don't know where it is a little bit of work maybe
the fastest you can do is probably a day
but you gotta have to yeah you have you have to um
but then I'd have to work my ass off I have to work my ass off to get all the paperwork done
to do like in a day so that's that's like um
it is how it is anyways sorry me starting to think about the housing market and I'm like
man I want my own place and then I look at the places that like it gets sold and I'm like oh
I do want my own place though I do want my own place eventually so
I'm willing I'll be happy to do my own paperwork for that
oh sorry give me a second step by
I'm gonna BRB I'm gonna need I'm gonna need to go get an ice pack again to put to ice my arm
because it's flaring up again
I'll be right back okay
so
so
so
so
so

okay sorry about that I don't know you'll you'll you might occasionally hear

logic lies firmly in that direction Mr. Johnson says one of my pupils scratched his priceless
Tucker I must say I was relieved when I learned he had no evidence pointing to one of my kids
if he had some lucky boy or girl would have been in for some quality time
say congratulations on finding Karen Fitzpatrick don't know how you did it but if I were still

an idle meeting
while doing that too.
I uh,

I decided to just put the
ice pack back in the freezer
since it was melting really fast too.

Did you hit, did you record it?
Wait what?
Why would I record that?
Hahahaha

Hahahaha
We don't practice corporal punishment here.
I've never believed in that old adage.
Spare the rod and spoil the child.
A rod is too thin.
But a baseball bat
That bridges the generation gap quite nicely.
Okay
Okay, okay.
Stay quick
Not again
Can I, can I skip it? There we go.
Bye bye
Can I, can I grab the bat?
No
I feel like I'm supposed to do something before night time.
I wonder how to do that.
The door's locked.
Is this it?
No
Oof.
Didn't mean to do that.
This has to be the closet, right?
Try the pulse badge?
I feel like I was supposed to use the blackmail him but I uh...
My button
Why I lost that months ago, where did you find it?
Funny thing that
I found it in the ashes
At the newspaper building
What are you implying?
That I had something to do with setting the fire?
Preposterous.
Why a hundred people must have visited that site since the fire?
But none of them had buttons like this.
You just try showing that button to Sheriff.
Oh yeah?
Button
Wait, can I see that again? Okay
Bye
Do I still have the button?
Okay
Okay
Do I go to the officer then?
I don't know
Can I use the screwdriver?
Damn it
Damn it
Well that didn't work
Okay, that didn't work so
What else do we have?
A wrench
Okay, well that didn't work
Electrical tape for the wire
Damn it
Wait, where did it go? Did I put it back in myself?
Yeah, I did
Well that didn't work
Oh wait
Oh man
Well that didn't work
Maybe I can set off the alarm here
Well that didn't work
Oops, didn't mean that one
Okay
No
Maybe I should do this at night time
Maybe I should do this at night time
Night time, night time
Can I really not go on the fire station?
Maybe I can do it at night time
How do we skip time?
Yeah, I don't know how, I feel like I need to do something
Before
Is this the note?
Yeah
Yeah, this is the last guy
who came in
Okay
Okay
Well that didn't work
Can I take a picture of that?

Mercy mutton

because she's thirsty to get in that closet
I do have my tea
I do have my tea senpai
Okay, the hint is that
when you get to the fire station
I don't think we can go to the fire station
unless it's night time
Maybe I'll go back to the lodge again
and be like, what's up?
I've had enough of this, I'm no thief
Of course I am
Okay, what am I doing with the pole?
No?
Okay, so I have to steal that pole
What flavor is my tea?
Today's tea is, I wrote it down
I wrote it down senpai
Today's tea is
raspberry pomegranate
green tea
Doesn't that sound nice senpai?
Maybe I should make copies
I remember seeing like, oh you can make
three copies here, right?
Maybe I can copy all of the stuff
hotel ledger
Oh man, well that didn't work
No?
My sign meet permission?
Oh man

What about this?
A copy of that?

I can't talk now
Bye
Bye
Wait, what was that?
Okay
Not here
Where'd he go?
The hell?
He's here, he's getting paid off
No
This is the worst part about point and clicks
Sometimes you know what to do, but you
don't know how to do them
Maybe I can blackmail
the post office man again
Maybe
Hi
Guess what I am
Hmm
Hmm
What about the miso guy? The miso guy
will kill me, we already know that, he just
He'll kill me at any moment
Wait

Looks like
Your tongue is pretty long, Koi

What does that tongue do?
It tastes, it has

Where'd he go?
See, he's not there
He's not there
Howdy
And not at the fire station
We can't get into the fire station
We can't get into the fire station
This is the part of point and click
cause I don't like where I'm just like
okay, we have to guess
and do dumb things now
He like, we can't get in
I think we can only get in
when it's like night out
Can you give your brother the autograph photo?
I tried last time

He's literally like, I don't care
Where is it?

Damn it
Damn it, okay, maybe not, jeez
There's nothing else to do at the lodge?

He just talks about the cloth
And that's it
We must point and click further
Further
What if I give you this?
What does that sheriff told you?
The sheriff said calm down
No
I
I didn't soft lock myself, right?
We didn't soft lock ourselves, right?
The diner?
Oops
That's the TV station, my bad
Oh, that's another Tucker, you're right
There, oh my gosh, he's right
There's like a ton of Tucker's
I always like those like blue stuff
I can't talk

Oh, I'm supposed to give the cloth
Wait, I was
Drawer on the left, hold on
I was supposed to give the cloth to him

You know what, never mind
Locked door

Good thing I saved

Okay, first I put electric tape
On the door
And I break in
So that it doesn't arouse suspicion
Senpai
Senpai

Yeah we might have to close it
Look it's stuck now Senpai
It's stuck now
Did I save? I saved
Oh wait no no no
I fixed it I hit exit again
We're good
Did you hear what happened at the barber shop?
Someone broke into Pastorelli's salon
and took his antique barber's pole
The next morning Pastorelli
touched some live wires that the thief left lying around
and was electrocuted
Well that darn foreigner got what he deserved
if you ask me
coming into a nice little town like harvest
and stealing business
Heavens if a bow and scissors
were good enough for your father
I don't see why decent working folk
need a fancy wop styling their hair
That's how it goes
First you get a sissy trim then bang
You're a communist
Isn't it exciting Steve?
Five days and twelve hundred cookies later
the bake sale is already here
Where does the time fly?
Those one thousand
two hundred cookies
Senpai
Oh about twenty
the rest were stale
but the effort wasn't wasted it's for a good cause
Will you be at the school tonight?
Wouldn't miss it
That's nice dear
It's good to be open to new experiences
Oh my gosh
No wonder your hair is terrible ma'am
That was definitely
a Facebook mom type of comment
Yeah
Oh my gosh
I would just like to tell
everyone I do not
believe and
reflect on this opinion
Anyways thank you for the super chat
A lot of these red
scissors are sharp this yandere
has kidnapped me and stolen my heart
There it rhymes
Yep that one rhymes good job good pat
Good good job
Good job
It's good to be
open to new experiences
at the conservative wife
Yeah
And disclaimer this game
was made a long time ago
and it was
a protest
against censorship
So therefore there is going to be some things
that are very you know
controversial
But
please know that I do not reflect
the opinions in these games
What's the good cause
The air
shock their systems gets them
every time
What
Okay bye
I guess
Yeah that's fine cookies
cookies
cookies
newborn baby
I guess that's it huh
Dang city folks
that makes
Empire
Okay
I have the paper
I don't have the paper
Wait no I do have the paper why didn't
I see it
I have the paper
Wow I just didn't see it here you go
kid
Man I hate this kid what do you want
Yeah whatever kid
Okay let's get out of here
Okay first mission
You gotta bot stem's residence
Now I haven't seen him
Yeah yeah I get it
I killed a person
I don't know
Was there a way I could
have saved him some pie
Hello dear
Yes please
The bake sale is tonight
Seven o'clock at the school
Lots of cookies and yards of floss
Hope to see you there
Guards of floss okay bye
Give my regards to your parents
Only indirectly
Why did I do that
I'm so sad
He can't be saved
That's okay
I don't know
I see my mother throwing out whole batches
of cookies like an automaton
getting rid of its surplus product
My so called mother has been baking
cookies all week and then
throwing them out better that
than getting rid of us
Wait around long enough
I have a feeling they'll get to it
I don't know if you heard or not
but Mr. Pastor Ali the barber
He's dead
Looks like somebody stole
a barber's pole from him
Then left the exposed electrical wires
and some water on the floor
Pastor Ali walked in flipped on the lights
and
No anything about that
No
Okay fine I didn't mean to kill him
I just wanted the pole for the initiation
Fuck it, fuck it we did this
That was our bed
Like a man died
I didn't know
I forgot about the live wires
and the water
That doesn't change the fact that you killed him
This initiation killed him
It was just an accident
It was just like some time
where I
Don't you see
I'm beginning to think that the lodge
poisons everything it touches
Harvest
I didn't create this situation
Are you sure
No
But however it started
I'm gonna see it through to the end
Vandalism theft
Manslaughter
What's next Steve, murder
Second
I know in the beginning I suggested you might check out the lodge
I was more worried about getting out of here
than anything else
But now that I know you
I'm worried about you too
I'm fine
I'm not fine
Come back and visit me soon
You can't just ask that after
After doing that to me
You can't just ask that
I know I understand
Sometimes sometimes
You know
Sometimes sometimes just force my hand sometimes
And then I just have to
I just have to
Yeah
I know it happens to the best of us
I didn't mean it though
I didn't mean it
Sometimes Senpai just walks into my knife
And my scissors
And my bat
And my
And the barrel
The bone saw was me though
But yeah
You sometimes just walk into all of them
And here it is
The object dog
The guard
Imported Phoenician glass
And Italian dreams
Italian dreams
An unfortunate side effect
That pastorelli was
electrocuted because
You left live wires
In a puddle
I didn't know there was a puddle
The stations of worldliness say
Say love you
Oh you can say it man it was electrocuted
Pastorelli's own incompetence
Caused his unfortunate
Accent
Maybe his incompetence
I had
You left live electrical wires
Hanging in the water
On the floor
Cross wired the alarm system
To the sprinklers
He'd be live today
Of course
You only wanted the pole
But that hardly matters now
But he turned on the light
What?
What?
What?
What do we have to do?
No not the nice lady
And her daughter's diner
Not the diner everybody eats
There
Not the French
They're not French
Are they?
They're not French are they?
Oh no oh no
Does that mean we have to fry
That means French
French Canadian
Oui oui
Ah sacre ble
And
Ah sacre ble
Ah
Ah whatever
That's no minor prank
So close
And yet so far
What a pity
Tonight
The big sale
What do you mean docks
That was on her debut
When sacrifice will be
The order of the day
What?
What?
Okay repeat this
Okay pastor only took a big spill
A permanent one
Alright any suggestions?
So
You know
He just went
Okay I gotta move the window
Up a little bit I can't get out of here
Without it moved
There it is
Um
I have to set fire
To that nice ladies
Diner
Bye bye
I can't talk now
The dishes are stacked up in back
And I better take advantage of the lull
I've whipped up a huge batch of brownies
For the PTA bake sale tonight
I just wish I could do more
To help out those poor bums
How will this sale help bums?
Most of the bums that die in harvest
Lack the money for a good Christian burial
The proceeds from this sale
Will help Mr Moynihan provide them
With proper burial services
Doesn't it strike you as funny
That so many wanderers die in harvest?
No
Strikes me as sad
You have an odd sense of humor Steve
Mr. Pastorelli was electrocuted
He's dead
It looks like some thief wanted
His barber's pole but didn't think of the consequences
Yeah
That's what the guy had to do
Maybe whoever it was really needed
That barber's pole bad
There's no excuse for hurting someone else
Even if Pastorelli were alive
Now his heart would be broken
And what's a little profit compared to that?
The most normal
These are the
These characters
Are the sense of
Is the moral reasoning
And I have to burn down
Their
Their precious home
I mean like this was her
Her memento from her
From the husband that went away
Ugh
I feel bad
But I'm not gonna stop
I'm not gonna stop
Ugh
I feel bad
I feel like really bad
But I'm not gonna stop
Ugh
Okay
Hello?
Yes
I did it
Got him! Yeah!
We did it!
Woohoo!
You're busted!
What will people think?
Yeah
He's a smiley bear
But we should give him a token of our
Appreciation for his silence
Here Stephen, take this baseball bat
You'll find it quite useful
Alright
Maybe I could use a good solid bat
Yeah boy
Take the bat
And we'll take the photo
However will I keep the children in line now
I have a spare I can bring in tomorrow
Unless you prefer a chainsaw this time
I'll talk to Mrs. Phelps
Can I do it again?
Okay
Well that didn't work
A chainsaw?
Oh strongy!
I feel so terrible
That's okay
Start using the bat
On what?
Okay
Mama AP

Anyways

Controversial game
1998
1996
1996 yeah yeah yeah yeah
It's a pretty old game
My breasts huh
Hope to see you at the back sale tonight
When I went to get my hair trimmed this morning
Imagine my surprise
When I learned that the barbershop
Had been burglarized
And worse that Mr.
Pastor really had been electrocuted
Harvest mourns the loss
Of an irreplaceable citizen
All of us will feel the loss
Only with the passage of time
Drop in again soon
If you weren't
If you weren't
If you weren't a diddler
If you weren't a diddler
Senpai
Senpai
Thank you so much secret for a gifting
A memba

Okay thing to say you know

We don't practice
That bridge is the
Oh dear

And then we give
See how easy it is
Things are so much better between us
When you remember the paper in the morning
Let's keep them that way
Have you tried flirting with mommy yet?
Yep I did
And then
I was like so is anything gonna happen
And then nothing happened so now I'm sad
That nothing happened but at the same time
A little relieved you know
I can't believe that if I break into a place
Then
Then I get a kiss on the forehead
And a tucked in good night
And like a death sentence for attacking someone
I can't believe it
I'm just like okay
Well
Go back to the Potsdam's residence
That was my bad
Is this a visual novel? No
It's a point
Look at us we're pointing
And we're clicking
There it is

Hi
Yeah you're imported glass
Blah blah blah blah
That's no minor
Prank
Okay
I guess I have to do it
The game will be over
I think I went to
Edna's diner
And she's like the voice of reason in this game
Hi Mr. Bake Sale
Mr. Pastorelli was electrocuted
He's dead
It looks like some thief wanted his
Barbers pole but didn't think of the consequences
Could you hit the lodge guy with the bat?
Maybe whoever it was really needed that
Barbers pole bat
That's no excuse for hurting someone else
Even if Pastorelli were alive now
His heart would be broken
We'll consider that
We'll consider that
Hi
We'll consider that
Or the sheriff
We'll consider those possibilities
Soon
Now
We can go spy on them
Hihi
Use the key
Oh man
Okay
We got it
Can I save?
Yeah
We'll save here
And then
Say cheese
Yeah
Blasted
What will people think?
Yeah
You'll find it quite useful
Should we
I wonder if it's like
I think the photo is worth more than that
Should we do that? Should we do like
There's more than that
Let's just see
I'll take the fricking bat
Whatever I'll take the bat
See ya
It's so true though
It's so true they're educators
They got no money
She's gonna bat you
I mean like
Apparently she already did
In her youth
I mean in my youth
Can I get some more meat?
My meat permission slip
Give me the meat
Yeah extra meat baby
Teachers don't get paid enough
You survived getting the bat?
Yeah
I'm gonna visit the barber shop
And cry a little
Oh no
That for the occasion I
Think about taking some of that sighting off my hand son
It's sad to see
To see that you know it's just a chart
The beef was well done too
Problem is both was burnt so bad
And the flesh all crisp
And distorted limbs melded
You couldn't tell them apart
And well I didn't want to take a chance
On eating Italian
No sir I didn't
You didn't want it? You were gonna eat him?
Nice to see you again Steve
You're gonna eat him?
I can't talk now son
I guess you heard
That dang edged pastorelli
Went out and got his self-electric cheated
Somebody stole the barber's pole
The alarm system triggered the sprinkler
There was water on the floor this morning
And the derm crook left exposed wires out
The pastorelli came in
Flipped the switch and then
ZAP
Maybe them aliens is hot for colored glass after all
Any time Steve
Not gonna lie
I'm a little sad
I'm a little sad
Pastorelli
He didn't talk much
But he was there
Okay now I gotta figure out how to burn that damn building now
Sorry son
I hear you've been spreading all sorts of gossip about me around town
Did I?
That was a lot
A hot town huh?
Don't forget this
I don't think I told anyone about you by the way
That was some whiplash for sure
Mood switch crazy
Sometimes my mood switch gets like that too
You still love me though right Senpai?
Was this game developed by Swarri?
I don't know
Hello Steve
Those PTA busybodies have hurt my business
Something terrible this week
Nobody's buying my cookies
They're all saving up for the big bake sale
Somebody stole the barber's pole from that nice Italian
Italian
Can you imagine?
And then they left wife wires dangling in a puddle
Which Pastorelli immediately stepped in and fried
The stupid dago
Heavens to Betsy when it rains it pours
My bad
Once again
What can I say other than
My bad
Tee hee
Hello
I feel sad
I feel like I'm responsible for my actions
But I'm still gonna do it
Give me a glue
I'm afraid that's not good enough
What do you want?
You want some meat?
What do I show on the hotel ledger?
Why should I
You want some meat?
Why should I care about that?
That's your favorite thing
Meat

Hotel ledger
How do I blackmail this man?
Can we give the meat to your father-in-law?
Oh yeah I could do that
Let's go see
If I can get some meat
That didn't work
It's not as bad as some
Point and clicks for example
And um
Sherlock Holmes
Um
No that can't be used for anything
No that can't be used for any
Can't be used for anything
Or use the ballonin
I have too many witnesses
You want meat?
Say that's
That's a nice cut there Steve
Did you bring it for me?
Sure
Sure you can have it
I'm gonna go get some meat again
This freak I know right
Why he just cares about the meat so much
Anyway I'm gonna go get some more meat
You literally can just give it to him
Okay that's interesting

Murderer

Fire station

Well it's quiet now
Maybe they all killed each other
Unfortunately
Kettle
Looks like we've got us a many
Crime wave on our hands
Just got a report about another
Act of vandalism
Maybe related to the tucker
And the fire station robbery
Someone broke into pastorelli's
Barbershop and took his pole
Next morning pastorelli touched
Some live electrical wires that were
Left dangling and zap
No more barber
What was just an act of vandalism
Has just become a case of manslaughter
Harvest used to be such a nice
Little town
Yeah
Stop on by any time Steve
Let me check
I don't think I still have it
Notes
Sheriff's checkbook
Fire
Um

Why does everyone think I'm talking about them
I didn't do nothing

Oh wait
I showed it to the lost woman
Aw man she snitched on me
Did she snitch on me

he's not wrong pastoral rally isn't in isn't in pain anymore nobody's gone now
nobody can have nice haircuts no one

church I've been here before no one has a nice haircut in this town I think he

gosh look I can't I can hold another weapon
wow I didn't know that was a weapon I'm gonna unarm myself now you've had a
weapon this whole time I didn't realize I did strange how there's a correlation
between the bums who've died and the bums you've put up at your hotel
neither am I but I can tell you the odds against that
a curious thing to do snooping around old ledgers you're an odd and resourceful
young fellow
welcome welcome hi hi oh my gosh it means here too
wow there's everyone's here whoa welcome to the stream everyone welcome hi
everyone I'm playing an old point-and-click game from 1996 called
Harvester which is a very controversial game yeah it's like they're all

ask the questions for the sheriff will be sure and tell Dwayne Dwayne hello for
oh you're in you can't have I was only indeed security I'm a young man we you
know I seem to have misplaced a ledger I don't think how strange except mr.
Potsdam I can't imagine what else could have happened to it perhaps the dead
walk again and they're hungry for literature at any rate should any of
them show those ledgers around they'll wish they'd stayed in their graves bye I'd
say it's been a oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah I'm gonna go to the I'm
gonna go to the sheriff and I'm gonna see what that's about or maybe I want
actually let's save
Senpai

show him my ledgers
I can't talk goodbye
any time kiddo okay okay this is the power of pointing clicks what do we do now

oh man I could have copied it
I want to I want to dig up dig up a grave I'm gonna dig up a grave
oh man can we look at the ledger again well that didn't work
mercy did you just try to apply logic to a 90s point and click game
yes I could have photocopied it and then given it back and then he would have been like
uh-huh thanks for taking it back and I'm like you can't copy his biatch
you know I could have I gotta wave it in front of his filthy face
it should have worked
should I should I simply should I give it back or should I be like
no
okay we'll save again we'll save again we'll save again maybe try to kill me oh
oops that's the wrong one how do I go back no that's not the one I wanted to save and
that's the one I wanted to save and yeah that one
he seemed pretty mad about it being stolen
is he gonna kill me again is he gonna kill me again
young man I'd say it's been
hold on hotel ledger strange how I'm not not you may be right
there's for knowledge and other things then you intend to leverage this
nominally engaging coincidence for personal gain yes what an immoral thing to do Stephen
I'm not the one up to my ass in dead bodies yes but you have an un-reasoning faith in the
consistency of the universe things can change young man I want you to live here or in the
sheriff's office be sure until Dwayne Dwayne hello for me hello you can't have that I was only
indeed and have you anything I could hold security I'm afraid can I give you your ding ledgers back
strange I'm not not hey you
me
how little you understand us us the slip of the tongue I'll ask you
you can't have his in sick
what are you gonna do with the glue call hi I'm gonna glue his ass
I'm gonna glue his butthole shut
now I'm just like oh man where is he much to think about
no he's not here is he in here no he's not in there either maybe they're at the school now
to do the the charity charity um drive
yeah closet
in fact the actor playing the main character is currently in jail for crimes oh
okay
found a guy you want to know how to get the glue sort of
what crimes there was no crimes we've all hit it we don't talk about that we don't talk about
that thank you mods
kind of a chapel
I don't do crimes crimes that's not me okay I thought there was nothing there
oh what the
oh there's like a dead person here
am I am I supposed to do that
something on top of the lectern
oh
yeah what is the whip sound in there
oh man
can I take a closer look
oh I could try taking a picture right that's a good idea
damn it oh man
why is there whip sounds you're right why are there lips
let me check out the photo where's the photo
hmm
what do I do with this information do I show it to him will we take it back
so
we take it back some pie we go to the the sheriff for this
sheriff's never here
look we blackmail in this house always and forever I didn't even know there was a body in
there thank you some pie well let's save in case we we mess up
in case we mess up
look at this
ah you've taken up photography I see now why on earth would you choose such a grotesque subject
that John Doe you've got boxed up in the chapel he didn't just drop dead someone helped him take the
plunge hmm you may be right I'm a mortician not a medical examiner you don't have to be to know
that being ripped to shreds can be detrimental to your health this is not something you want to
be looking into young man
okay what should we say number one or number two some pie no shit I just want to find out who I
am get the hell out of here or is that a threat I've got the goods on you not vice versa
number one number one no shit that's what we all want what do you mean that's a game we win or
lose together wait what are you gonna tell me what I want to know or do I go to the sheriff
with these pictures that would be a grave mistake I assure you I've told you all I can
my losses have been substantial of late so I can't offer you money
the only thing I can give you an exchange for the photographs is my tube of astro glue I do
suggest you take it for it's all you'll get from me here we go should we just take the glue now
yeah we're just oh it's a trade or should I say not good enough I'm going to the sheriff
I'll probably die
fuck it I want to see be sure and tell actually I want the young man it seems like that corpse in
the chapel I'll dress up and nowhere to go god knows by putting these people up at the wayward
hotel I do orps the corpse reclining in the chapel right now is a prime example of the difficulties
I've just like oh that's where the hint came from he died a purely natural car but why come to harvest
to die I've often puzzled this was this was the hint oops though I can assure you young man that
nothing untoward is happening in harvest on the contrary it's an indication of our compassion
that I put up hobos in the wayward hotel and the order of the harvest moon mandates their prompt
burial even when they are without family or means and when it entails losses on my part
bye okay that was the hint say it's been a that was a hint he why didn't you tell me that before
anyways give me this again ah you that john hmm you don't this is
that's what we would get a look that would be I do suggest okay I'll take the glue wise decision
when a wasp's nest is stirred up it is seldom the wasps who grieve later thanks for the glue get
out of here I got a little things at our order but we got there we got the glue
now what do I do with the glue I wanted it so badly I wanted it so badly but now I'm just like well
what do I do with it wasp like the wasp lady yeah
yeah
I really wanted to oh wait I can't talk okay bye
we still have the bake sale today right and we need to burn the place down right
can't talk now
nope we still have the bake sale
bake sale bake sale where is the bake sale it's at school
no
seeing you here again what my breast just swells with when I went to get my head and worse
drop in again
adult quality time
see what we have our inventory we have the hotel ledger
mortuary ledger astral glue
damn it damn it damn it damn it
what can we do about the burnt flyer if I show the burnt flyer to him
that interests me not at all young man okay
where do I go next
maybe back home
I don't want to sleep it's the baby hello
okay don't forget to put the pin
okay okay we gotta figure out how to burn that place down
let's talk to the wasp lady yeah he did say about the wasp nest right
what if I show her the glue
it's not often
you want you want some glue
I have okay never mind
um geez why do
I get fire
okay first off we need something as a fire starter
oh wait the but maybe you could use the glue on the people
that sounds logical and therefore it probably won't work but that does sound
logical and maybe we'll be in for a surprise let's go see
let's go see let's go see if we can do it
where's my astral glue okay well that didn't work
no did you have a gas can yeah I gave it back though
I uh I gave it back though I gave it back so that the other man can start arson
arson logic fails again
can I grab this can
give me it give me it oh I want it I want that can of gas
okay we need something for the fire maybe maybe gonna ask the post office man
you know a lot about fire right wait is that a present in the background uh you know a lot
about fire right yeah my button funny thing that what are you implying
got the crap and what if I did I guess I'd be pretty grateful to anyone who could help get me off
the hook how you seem like a capable lad hypothetically let's say there was a gas can sitting
in the evidence room at the sheriff's office a gas can which might have some oh and Steve
okay sure um I already did that though like way at the beginning of the game
um burn flyer that interests me
I take it you can't take take the can nope
I got the barbershop can I grab the the wires does he have another one I don't think so but
I feel like that was a that was a dialogue that was meant for the beginning of the game
and here it is okay blah blah
yeah of course your final assignment is to set up
all right yes I suggest okay okay how do I get a fire
anything new in the general store oh there could be something new in the general store
no there is nothing new in the general store
how do I start a fire I want is there anyone with matches maybe I can get a match in a blowtorch
who would have a pair of matches
oh azzera azzera azzera azzera
welcome azzera
welcome azzera and raiders welcome to the stream
hello everyone I'm right now playing harvester
which is a 1990 uh
sixth game that's very controversial welcome welcome welcome everyone hi hi welcome to the
stream is is is azzera already going gone slips is it spooky it's a little spooky
but more like a parody than anything
oh welcome everyone I'm so glad everyone's here I'm trying to find something to start a fire with
is this a game about farming no
yeah it's more creepy and spooky can I get no matches have you gone to the bake sale yet
the bake sale hasn't started yet can I grab anything here
now
the bake sale hasn't started yet unless it already did
yin memario school it hasn't started yet it should be here but it hasn't started yet
see the bake sale will be held here but I haven't gotten it yet so I guess I'm going to have to
find a pair of matches but where am I going to get matches from
maybe the bake sale will happen at night
y'all got matches around
um does the store sell some the store doesn't have anything
so
would would the general lady have one okay I'll ask her you got any lighters
no doesn't look like it
maybe
what if I ask him about fire
sorry son no fire don't mumble son
dang it next time you put I just want something like a match or maybe a candle
you talked to Stephanie since you had to reload the game again I think so
if it isn't my fate
okay this goat lady is hiding to bed good night scissor lady good night goat lady
I think I talked to her I'm glad to see you yep I did come back and visit maybe I can snoop in her
her room I think she would have already started a fire I think she would have already started a fire
let's try
let's try yeah let's try the fire station you guys got any fires around here
no no they're not
the station of fire
thank you we need to figure out what to do with the glue I just wanted it
I really wanted it I really wanted the glue and I got it
and now I'm just like what I do with I know it's important but I don't know what it is
I've earned the glue I've earned it now I can feed some pies
now some pies don't have to just eat crayons
you don't have matches right now I don't think I have matches
I think he just meant don't kick the horn his nose

what is it now Hank what why are you sitting in front of that blank tv
someone burnt down the tv channel there's nothing wrong nothing wrong honestly Hank
you're acting like an alcoholic I told you all that tv would hurt you
watching tv don't hurt me mom but not watching tv hurts bad if I find out who burnt down the tv
station I'll make him wish he was one of those damn Indians
uh I still want to hit my brother
Hank come on right mom how did the bake sale go
hello dear how are you today the nerve of some people burning down the tv station to detract from
our bake sale I doubt the perpetrator did it just to annoy the harvest pta coincidence I don't think
so just six months ago the newspaper building went up in smoke obviously there's a fire bug on the
either that or a communist communist huh I'm so scared
why are you so why are you scared now that the bake sales over I just don't know how I'll
fill my time oh I feel so useless what's wrong with her
oh it's not as bad as it looks you just pop them back in
see as good as new that tarantula she ate must have had wasp eggs in it
don't you think we should get her to a doctor what for she's got her mother how silly I was
feeling useless just because there are no more cookies to bake I can still rear my brood this is
a sign Steve I have a purpose again glad to see you're feeling better mine that fire still burns
my bridges first the newspaper building then DNA's diner then WHAR I sense a pattern and any
pattern I can't make a dress out of is no darn good I suppose you heard about DNA's diner burning
down sheriff Dwayne thinks it was a grease fire we took a black eye on the bake sale but I'm sure
the harvest pta annual blood drive will be more successful overall we made about 200 dollars
hardly enough to bury a dead horse and definitely not enough to cover the annual blood drive
the blood drive
oh is my sister okay annual blood drive huh if you knew how much blood we get you'd be more impressed

I'm not one to gossip but I'm sure you've heard that DNA's diner burned down but did you know
she killed herself when she found out what her and her daughter too what I hear the sheriff suspects

you're just trying to get to the bottom of all this no matter the price right
you're right you're right this has gone too far
well what do I say what do I say oh no morality gotta get out of here
we're into deep
probably too do you mean it yeah I'm ashamed of the things I've done then you'll stop the
initiation process yeah
bye come back and visit me soon okay
by the way did I mention I'm a liar
let's go to the lodge
DNA's diner is no oh that hurts
I've always been such a kid her
as soon as she realized what had happened to her beloved establishment
a true entrepreneur and a credit to our nation
you bastards you made me a murderer
her suicide was an unforeseen by-product predictable by no one she killed herself
she made our choice if you were a catalyst join the rest of the world we all live
of the deaths of others still you sought to torture diner and to which
candidate I thought I was initiation this was only a trial to determine your worthiness for
testing your initiation into the mysteries of the harvest will soon begin what in the meantime
be patient protocols must be observed before initiation you think you got a
sore throw from that I think probably took a lot to break you will know when you receive the
invitation bring it here and your initiation shall begin
what do you mean it took forever to get here
what is this two different things
still you sought to torture
regardless having completed the trials an invitation shall be forthcoming
meantime how are you let me see if I can put on the bat
can I I can't even go close to him
that is unfair that's cheating
wow I can't get close to him
I can't get close to him save all right let's go to I want to go to the tv station
save game
don't sleep in jeans senpai he's immune I know he's immune thank you
artist for being a member
say can you spare a dime for a buckaroo who's down on his luck oh my gosh the whole shebang
just went up in flames and I'm looking to mosey on to greener pastures where the sun sets
always golden and there's always another savage to kill oh my gosh his face is completely
well can I break in
well that didn't work well that didn't work man
well I'm surprised he's he survived yeah me too geez
okay scene
I've tried so hard to find an excuse to keep on fighting
I care and I can't go on alone any longer this diner he loved us was all we had
was always a struggle to keep it running in such a small town
and now we've lost it I know that I can't afford to support this now there's only one way out
I'm sure you won't be able to understand the depth of despair that would enable mother to
put a rope around a baby's neck and push him into the air and jump after her
and when your father makes me know if she kicks around and takes a long time to strangle
else for you I won't cut her down I've got to be stronger than I ever was before
but I hope she doesn't get it
God help us and forgive us
oh they're showing it huh
is is that the sheriff
who cooked his food
I feel so bad
now he has no place to eat
I'm sorry I get a tan
seeing you here again when it rains it pours isn't that so first Edna goes through all that with
her daughter then she loses her diner if that happened to me I'd hang myself
drop in again
they're really they're really really pushing it oh it hurts it hurts
thank you he's a total issue for the member
they're like I was like okay don't feel bad don't feel bad we had we had to do
one must be done and now they're making me feel bad
like everyone else they're like oh they deserved it Edna though no she never deserved any of that
why do you like that
think about taking some of that siding off my hand son I'll cut you a nice price on it
the tv station burning downs being good for business lots of folks are thinking of investing
and I murdered her yeah
nice to see you again Steve I can't talk now son I'm busy with this game
ain't that a kick in the head first we lose the only barber in town in poop no more diner either
why don't they beat all and now that the tv station's burning down maybe folks will get off
their duff and get outdoors maybe take up alien hunting say clown will aluminum siding protect
you from them alien censor jobbies nope you show up on their radar as a hunter surrounded by
aluminum siding trust me leads to take just my luck anytime Steve
oh at least they didn't twist the knife over and over again
sorry son no time to talk neither rain nor sleep nor snow nor hell shall keep the mail from its
appointed rounds hello there young man what's the good word someone burned WHAR down last night
really I hadn't heard anything about it and since I don't have a tv I didn't notice it was off really
fire don't mumble
son WHAR don't mumble son hey bye next time you put
oh at least he's happy about it
didn't say anything about Edna though
about the general store
hello Steve I don't mind telling you when I heard what happened to the diner I went out and got me
extra insurance right away I have no desire to wind up dangling from my rafters like Edna
believe you me Steve did you see the fire as I was watching the tv station go up
I was reminded of the old Sentinel building when you think about it you know two communication
complexes going up in smoke you have to wonder if it was a coincidence
hello Steve well I bought everything from her
yeah well she bought extra insurance
I guess we can check what happens with
oh can I not oh wait I can't visit her anything you got to say it's not okay bye
well I guess the wasp lady's okay she's fine well let's see what this guy says oh we hate this guy
sorry Steve too tired to talk right now I just gave the Tucker a tune up I'll talk to you later
DNA's diner burned down what a shame women running things that's the problem if she'd
had a man around that fire never would have happened what a waste damn terrible thing that business
with the tv station I can't sleep now we hate some waking up in a cold sweat
I'm thinking of getting some fireproof aluminum siding for my garage we hate some that's a good
I hate some
uh we'll probably get killed if we spread smash his car but goodness that I smash it
hmm I don't like that I don't like it no Sherry that woman was the voice of reason
that one was the voice of reason
nah and now it's a real one young man we real
the WHAR fire is just another example of the vagaries of my profession
odd after such a catastrophic conflagration not to have any fatalities disappointing in a way
I might have gotten some paying customers for a change
okay so nobody died
nobody died surprising
is he still gonna talk again
we
bye
no I don't need to go to the cemetery there's nobody in the cemetery
fire station can I go into the fire station now nope looks like I can't
please station
wait wasn't that the guy at the morgue how does he do be a receptionist at the same time
magic game logic
what about game memorial
seeing you here again oh did I already talk to him
Stephen I'm glad that discipline ah Stephen you're just in time I was about to administer a
lesson in good citizenship to these youngsters I'm sure one of these precious darlings burnt
down the television station and they if the little shits could talk I'm sure I'd find out who but as it is
I guess everyone will have to take my special civics course again
okay bye stop by anytime Stephen okay bye
oops
why can't they talk they said they look zombified maybe they sold sold their mouse
shots or anything
hi nothing
nothing
heat plant
tv station
say what happened the whole shebang
I give him his thing say what happened no
where are the meat coming from highly likely cats it's highly likely cats
um
I talked to everyone
maybe I'll give my brother a memento
maybe he wants it now
oh shut the fuck up
did you go to the missile base should I talk to the missile
I'd be holding a bat because I equipped him with a bat
no sleeping jeans
can I use the ladder to get the yellow thing off the roof the the frisbee
potentially oh man probably not talk to my dad again
what
hi hi dad
hi dad um
did I talk all right I was supposed to talk to the guy right
I'm gonna happen to dad when a man and a woman are very much in love
they bring out the scaffolds the barbed wires etc and one day you're gonna have to learn about it too
halt who goes there it's just me steve what do you want did the llamas send you
no the llamas they hear me
what should I say
thank god for that your next assignment is to infiltrate the lodge before it's too late
get it at all costs mister oh god help us all
hi remember duck and cover
I think if you say they're pink he sets off the nukes I figured
I figured he would I was like I set off the nukes once I can't do it again anything else
the guy's got access to nukes yep he's got access to nukes and therefore
how do I get the sign
is this it do I like just I'm done
check your mailbox oh yeah there could be a mailbox oh yeah there is a mailbox
nope nothing
we talked to Stephanie I did talk to Stephanie
what good gosh she's such a brat even without tv let's go check out Stephanie
I just sleep I think this game makes you go to sleep
oh what happened
what the fuck happened
what do you mean your dad must have pulled some strings be sure and check Stephanie's pillow
you lucky bum what the hell are you talking about you'll see once the sheriff gets here
huh Stephanie Stephanie things will never be the same now
yes I'll be watching tv nights what the heck what okay you can come in now son
she she dead
god is that what I think it is yep it's a spinal cord is it Stephanie
I can see a resemblance but I can't be sure more pie sheriff pie don't you realize what's happened
oh indeed I do I can just hear the tongue waging at the pta
was it suicide
never heard of anyone pulling their own spinal cord out before off the record I'd have to say nope
no all in all I'd say this was dead by natural causes natural causes natural causes
you can't live without a spinal cord son nothing unnatural about that
think I will have some more pie
right away I can't believe this well I guess he has a point believe me you get to the point
to where this is routine
now the only clue we got is that card on her pillow take a look at it
I can't fucking read that be it known that the sacred order of the
practically confession confession to watch son murder isn't that what you're here to investigate
son you don't investigate natural deaths no point then I'll get to the bottom of this myself
yeah I'm sure you will
more pie sheriff
don't mind if I do
all right let's take a look at that card again
I guess we got the lodge invitation
hello Steve have some pie
there's skeleton in the family closet
we're going to put her in the crypt keeping bodies in the house
it's just not sanitary I see I don't suppose it'd hurt for you to take the card
seeing as it was addressed to you
the shucks
senpai senpai
but that's my job so I wonder if there's more pie
thank you boy for the 420 tip
a lot of senpais died in natural causes
oh it happens you know
it just happens when and senpai's being a little oh shh low guy
we got the invitation in the end at what cost
I'm so hungry Steve so hungry
if I'd been an astronaut I could afford all the meat I want the red kind
and the young pink kind too
pink kind
okay they said family crypt right well I guess we're going there again
here we go
oh
I'm only full of cannibals yeah here we go again
oh right in time my rash is starting to act up damn it there we go
no I thought that was the hint
okay
I I pre-booked I thought I thought she would be yours or there was a hint about that
okay
is your arm any better now
well it's slightly I might have to go get the ice pack again what does the note say
hold on
I'll go back to my house to look at the note
where is the note there it is
be it known that the sacred order of the harvest moon hereby extends notice of the eligibility
of Steve Mason her niche initiation into the sacred mysteries of the harvest let me
presented with all the possible haste to sergeant and arms for
for commencement of the rites
okay I wish my rash would leave me alone too
if we have to meet him now
what do you want from me
you received the invitation but you have not brought it
what do you mean brought what I don't understand the invitation was not the card
but the spinal cord it must be presented to me I have to get the spinal cord
you to enter
you expect me to steal their mains and bring them here you stick bastard
he wants the freaking spine
you were provided an invitation bring me the skull and spinal cord if you would pass to the
world beyond okay I don't understand what's the other one I you were provided and okay okay
well I go back now I guess
looks like I go back
if this is this a metaphor to grow a spine probably
well I already grave robbed so we're fine
here we go
back at it again we already did this I did this way earlier that's so funny
that's so funny that I already did this I did things out of order
okay get over here
it says reference to sub zero's fatality oh yeah that makes sense
here you go you stinking bitch
ah you have done well now let the initiation commence as your mystic
mystic ag
requested and required that I turn over this sacred dagger to you to aid you in your quest
what is this what the heck you just gave me the logo
you must now enter the lodge initiates find it our style place are you supposed to help me
or get me killed I'm starting you on the path of initiation to a very special very exclusive
brotherhood I am merely the administrator of a test whether you view me as an enemy
or a friend depends on how well you're prepared to pass this thing you haven't said what it is
it is a special weapon using it will be part of the initiation
the hell with your initiation
okay whatever occurs in here is relevant to the great question which you cannot help but answer
what is at issue is whether in answering the question you will find the answers you seek
you will encounter those intent on preventing or prompting your answer depending on how you
look at it while the assumption is you want to live dying is easy and provides its own answer
but not for you just tell me is Stephanie dead or being held within the membership director
on the second level keeps track of such wow you just talked a lot then you are against me
I am the sergeant at arms I am here to ensure that the protocols are observed
deviation from a protocol shall result in punishment remember what I have told you
now let the initiation begin yeah making him deliver that much exposition with that with
that voice is a lot not again the third disc
it worked the first time give me a second save and give me another second some pie I'm gonna have to
my arm itchy I'm gonna have to get the um oh what's the word
congrats on completing the tutorial Kohai thank you I need to ice my arm again
I need to ice my arm again okay
okay I'll BRB some pie
okay okay some pie I have the ice pack on me so my my hands my arm movement is very limited
so we're gonna try anyways let's see how this goes
hopefully it calms down for the night I normally I would I think I would take some
Benadryl but I don't want to get sleepy because I want to see if uh if if I can finish this
oh you're here excellent you'll find them through that door excuse me you are the exterminator
are you not no in that case I'm afraid you'll have a hard time of it sir
recently the lodge has become infested by pests they need exterminating or
you were a part of the lodge this whole time they need killing and plenty
that's the quickest way to the second level the second floor sir the entrance is hidden
but a little reflection should reveal the answer to find the key to the second floor
reach deep within yourself I wish you good luck sir I only hope you can stomach what's ahead
okay
bust of George Washington glares down at you in silent reboot
bust of Barbara Bush glares down at you Benjamin Franklin glares down at you
in silent rebel Thomas Jefferson Beethoven pretty sure that was Beethoven
hold on let me see my inventory
all my items are gone I guess that's the only thing I have where is it

upon leaving the strange rooms behind you notice a burning feeling in your skin
you also notice a gooey film of slime covers your clothes
a totem mystic figurine mysterious and impressive clearly made
clearly made in china says so on the bottom
cracked vase oh a real plant
oh this is a cloakroom sir by definition not a fitting place to seek answers
however it's plain that the acid from your ordeal is eating away at your clothing and skin
I can clean your clothes for a minor consideration of five dollars I just change it
I don't have five dollars
servingly as you step over the rug you spy a brand mark seared into the fur
where a dozen books on animal husbandry bound in leather and authored by very
prius leading third rike scientists or eyes of this mutated cow blink in this
disinterested lee listening in the fire life this initiation process is so
thank you me sack of s for the 10 the 10 tip the initiation is pretty freaky

It crashed!
Is it not going to appear again?
Is it not going to appear again?
Oh no, it's not capturing!
Senpai is not capturing right now!
I think I'll take this as a sign, Senpai.
I'll take this as a sign to stop right now.
I think this is the sign.
It's going to just catten.
Wow, Senpai! It looks like we're going to have to return to this game another day.
I'm pretty sure we're very close to the end, so it'll probably be the game and then probably another game if I finish earlier.
But oh man, did it crash!
It's okay, I'm so happy to have all my Senpais here with me.
So let's check my schedule.
Okie dokie.
Tomorrow is my day off.
Tomorrow is my day off and then I will have my karaoke on Sunday.
And then I'll post my upcoming schedule around Sunday, probably.
Yes, most likely.
So I hope, oh man, I feel bad that we haven't finished the game, but hey, it crashed!
What else are we going to do?
Thank you for the 420 almighty hair on!
When a lovely Senpai you are.
I'm excited for karaoke, but I'm also a little nervous, so I hope Senpai doesn't mind if I'm not the greatest singer, but I'm trying!
And that's the idol way, right?
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your, your arrow idol.
In training! Well, maybe I am already an idol.
Oh well.
It's the hardest I count, so I'm going to try my best.
I'll try my best for Senpai.
What exactly is an arrow idol?
Well, if you take away the A, what does it say?
Senpai, figure it out!
Good job Senpai, I'm proud of you!
Remember, use your brains, and your eyes.
Your eyes and your brain.
It's okay Senpai.
We got, we have to, we have to be a little sneaky here.
We have to be a little sneaky here.
It's okay, I forgive you.
That's asking a lot, Kohai. No it's not!
Heck, I'll even, I'll even put in some books into the cages so you'll read.
Like a Moby Dick, or a Skylight Letter, or a Picture of Dorian Gray.
You can have a lot of books to read and then your mind will open.
Or I'll open your mind myself using an axe.
Can we get some Hamlets? Sure.
How about the Mysterious Island?
I've got, what book do I have?
Hold on, Senpai, I have a book about an island just for you.
The Island of Dr. Moro. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The Island of Dr. Moro. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, where's Waddle? Where's Waddle? Where's Waddle? Where's Waddle? It's too easy.
Can we read Cardcaptor Sakura instead?
Did you even watch Cardcaptor Sakura?
Speaking of, speaking of Senpai.
Did you do your homework yet?
We still have time. Of course you have time.
I just wanted to make sure earlier you start the Moro free time you have.
This class has homework?
Yep. I can explain. Yeah, about that.
Well, I'm going to expect my thousand word essay. It's very, I'm being very lenient.
And your thousand word essay do by, I think I said, I said in three weeks, right?
So that means this is week one. No, this would be week two.
You have one more week.
Wait, what's the essay on? Cardcaptor Sakura?
Cardcaptor Sakura. Everyone needs to watch.
Everyone needs to watch Cardcaptor Sakura in the two movies.
Where do we post it?
I'll post it on my Twitter and then everyone can reply underneath.
Does it matter how it's written? I'll take MLA citation.
What about clear card? Clear card is unnecessary. That's only bonus material.
That's bonus material. You don't have to do that. It's only if you really want to.
I'll take MLA citation or APA.
Make sure to alphabetize it.
Google docs. Not Google.
Not Google. You have to send it in.
Actually, better yet. Marles. I'll give you a grade.
If you send it through Marles, I'll give you a grade on it.
What's our reward? You want some motivation?
What's more motivating than a job well done?
In a little phrase. Heck, I'll tell you I'm proud of you.
Does Marle have a max word count? I think it's a thousand, which is what I'm saying.
I'll make it 500. 500 word. How about that? 500 word essay.
The card after your localization is okay. Yeah, localization is okay too.
I think Marle is exactly a thousand. I was going to say a thousand characters. It'll be fine.
You have to write about how much you liked it and how great Sakura is and what you think about the series.
I want you to learn from it. There you go. I mean so nice.
I would just torture everyone and be like, you have to watch it in these days and if you don't.
Well, I guess there's a free vacancy in the cage.
Honestly. Honestly, I just think it's just fun.
I think it'll be fun if I can talk to my senpai about something that I really love.
I actually really like the Novana one. Novana? Is that the company? I like the Novana dub. That's the one I grew up with.
So I want something in common with senpai and what's better way to connect our hearts than through anime.
Can I write about how much I love Mercy? You can do that as bonus work.
I think it'll be fun though. I think all of us watching something together would be really fun.
And so I can gap about it and everyone will be like, oh okay, I get it. I understand.
The one from the early 2000s? Yes, that one.
Do we have to do our sources? No, but it's just fun to mess with you.
I'm not going to do a watch along on YouTube simply because, wow.
I'm getting in trouble. I'm getting bonked. I'm getting a little spanky.
I get a little spanky. So I don't want to do that. I don't want to get in trouble.
I worked really hard. I worked really hard senpai to not get bonked by YouTube.
So I worked really hard. I've even been like, I hope I don't get in trouble for uncensoring now.
But now that I've got monetization, then they can take it away at any point.
Thank you, boy, for your $1 tip. Congrats on 5,140 subscribers.
We can celebrate karaoke, right? Do I have 5K already? Thank you.
Thank you, everyone, for your support then. I really appreciate that.
My next big goal will be 10K. What do you think?
Had you been censored on your model this whole time? Oh, yep.
Will you be able to do song requests on your street on Sunday?
I don't think so, mostly because I practice these songs.
10K sounds easy. I don't know. That sounds kind of hard.
Do you have a favorite Sakura outfit? I love the cat outfit and I love the prince outfit as well.
I think those are really cute.
You could do 10K without even trying? Really?
I don't know. That seems really hard.
I mean, I would be super happy if we reached 10K, but do you need to watch the movies too?
Yes, of course. That's how the series ends. It's within the movies. That's how it ends.
It's really nice. Also, the first movie is really nice and the second movie is really nice too. I think they're really good.
It's possible. Let's hope.
My biggest goal is going to be 100K, so Mama Mercy can be like,
Oh, look, you got a play button. That's nice.
But you remember us when you get famous? Of course. I always remember all my supplies.
Is there a manga too or does anime and movies cover it all? The anime and movie pretty much cover it all.
Actually, the anime has more stuff than the manga.
Will you name the button after your parents if you can put anything on it? I think I'll just put myself on it.
I'll get a bigger cage if we get 100K. I'll get a bigger cage for everyone.
I think if I can order more than one, I think I'd like to give the allure one, strong one, and then get my own.
I think I'll keep it as my channel title as a memento of it.
You can order more, but it does cost. I'm willing to pay for the cost of it.
I'm willing to pay for the cost of it.
Or getting one to me as well.
I really want one. Mama's been trying to give me suggestions on how to get to 100K really fast and she was like,
Sweetie, you should do a film tour of the Costco. People are always interested in watching Costco.
Yeah, Costco's vlog.
I don't think I can show a tour of the local Costco because I think that would dox me hard.
But I admit, I'm pretty sure there's a lot of people who are very interested in Costco.
Costco dream date. Cost effective and free samples.
Show off the Costco rotisserie chicken. Yeah, actually those are pretty good.
I've never seen one, so I just did. You can pass the laptops.
ASMRRP concept virtual Costco tour.
I think my favorite, you stalk images and pretend I'm taking you through Costco.
Oh, that'll be so funny. Okay, I'll see when I can do some pie.
Imagine if Costco sponsors us. That's not going to happen. We're definitely not family friendly.
Are there VR chat? I don't think I have a model for or I don't even have like a regular model.
Costco's family friendly?
Well, yeah.
I think so. Yeah.
Anyways.
Oh, I'm getting a little, little, I'm getting the little eye burns.
So I'm going to guess that I'm getting really, really tired.
He's a placeholder model.
I'm getting really tired. So I'm looking forward to tomorrow being my day off and then I can hang out with some friends if I wanted to or just rest the entire day.
Who knows?
Mercy, your mouth is the most expressive I've ever seen. Excuse me.
I think it's because I'm an expressive person.
I think it's because I'm an expressive person. Otherwise, otherwise, I think it would be pretty much the same as any of my other gen mites.
But yeah, I'll take a good slaps.
But yeah, I look forward to seeing my supplies on Sunday. I may need breaks if, for example, you know, once again, my arm decides to flare up and be, be, be bad.
So yeah, I hope everyone has a good one. Okay.
And I'll see you again next time.
Speaking for Mercy! Bye!
Thanks for watching!
