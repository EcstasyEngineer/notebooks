1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,600
CONFUSION

2
00:04:40,600 --> 00:05:10,240
Okay, we're going again, Tempai!

3
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:19,320
I had, um, what happened was I got an alert as well on my phone saying, severe thunderstorms,

4
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,520
it's gonna go all the way to the weekend, blah blah blah blah blah, and then I'm laying

5
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:37,440
in bed and I'm like, yeah, fuming mad, that I, uh, haven't, that I had to end stream early,

6
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:46,480
and then suddenly, dead silent, Tempai, it was dead silent, except for one, one thunder,

7
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:52,240
and it was like, completely dead, like, no wind, nothing, it was completely dead and

8
00:05:52,240 --> 00:06:00,640
I was like, for real, like the forecast literally said it wasn't, it wasn't, it was gonna like

9
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:12,960
last a long time, and I was like, oh my gosh, but like, it was like flashing and everything

10
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:20,200
and then suddenly, dead silent, can you believe it?

11
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:33,000
Maybe I willed the storm away, but now we're gaming!

12
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:43,440
I'm so sorry though, that I had to end early, I have a very old, old, um, surge protector,

13
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,440
like, when I say old, I mean it's over, over ten years old, and so I don't, like, over

14
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,440
a decade, right?

15
00:06:52,440 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't trust it to do, to do its job, oops, let's do the triple move, like, I was actually

16
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,520
so mad, Tempai, I, you have no idea, I was so mad that, that I had to end stream because

17
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,680
I just don't have, are you serious?

18
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:55,880
Yeah, you might max HP, pitch slap him, oh yeah, oh yeah, I might see, do you ever find

19
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:14,400
peaches XXX in the game, yes I did, which I assume was panties, oh, Bowser leveled up,

20
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:25,480
is Bowser better at magic or physical, I thought I missed stream, welcome back Mercy,

21
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:39,080
I'm glad to be back, I literally was, uh, super, super mad, super, super, super mad,

22
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:51,240
super mad that I had to end stream, I'm probably gonna have to like, get a new, new, new power

23
00:08:51,240 --> 00:09:17,880
surge thing, cuz, that's ridiculous, right, docile, pitch slap, I was really upset, and

24
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,480
then suddenly, like, honestly, I was really upset, I was malding, I was literally malding

25
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,480
and begging, yeah, I wanna see my Tempai's, I miss them, I need them, I wanna play Mario

26
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:47,760
with them, and, suddenly it became quiet, like, extremely quiet, and then suddenly

27
00:09:48,400 --> 00:10:06,560
the weather forecast said it, the storm would pass, and I was like, oh, alright, honestly,

28
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:14,160
I was a little peeved, right, I honestly should probably get, um, get a, let's do it again,

29
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:22,480
oh no, actually that was a one time thing, dang it, malded so much people, you're right,

30
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:41,360
I should take it off, I dislike this jester thing, like, come on, come on, yes,

31
00:10:45,040 --> 00:11:05,840
oh, shit, I missed that, uh, never mind, did I say my timing was great, I lied,

32
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:27,040
I lied, I can literally just go by, wait, hold on, I actually need this platform, excuse me,

33
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,120
excuse me, excuse me, thank you,

34
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,920
oh my gosh, I hear the rain again, oh, I'm gonna ignore it,

35
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:54,800
oh, why are you doing this, why, you're so rude,

36
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,800
I'm gonna, bitch slap it,

37
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:17,040
he must boycott the weather, it doesn't sound like as bad as earlier though,

38
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,000
it doesn't sound as bad as earlier, earlier was definitely a, uh, a, uh,

39
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:36,000
I thought I could bounce on him and fight him,

40
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,280
it's malo off said he's being replaced, he's not being replaced, he's just being,

41
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:55,280
being, no, you're right,

42
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:07,280
oh,

43
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,280
yeah,

44
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,480
I was hoping you just weren't in the eye of the storm, I was hoping that too, it was, it was,

45
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:32,560
oh, insane, not gonna lie to you, it was kind of like, wow, it's always these guys, huh,

46
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,120
feel like I should use like more honey syrup,

47
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,720
yeah, you got a freebie, nice, I'm getting a lot of freebies,

48
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,560
yeah, look at my timing,

49
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,600
slap, slap, uh, that was, oh well, that's fine,

50
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:15,600
yeah,

51
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,720
whoa,

52
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,720
maneuvering, so good,

53
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,840
so

54
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:45,680
that's to say, take a look at booze, boosters family purchase in order from the oldest to youngest,

55
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:55,840
I don't remember, look, need key to get in,

56
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:12,240
oldest to youngest, oldest was you, right,

57
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,240
yeah,

58
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:36,240
you got an orb,

59
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,240
man,

60
00:15:40,240 --> 00:16:00,800
I don't remember,

61
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,800
can I remind you, my mom's not here,

62
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:30,800
I gotta do this myself then,

63
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,600
there I go, be gone,

64
00:16:50,480 --> 00:17:00,800
be gone, be gone, testes,

65
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:10,880
I don't remember the order, was it you,

66
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,360
it's okay, I'll battle all of them,

67
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:29,520
oh yeah, slap,

68
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,920
sometimes you finish the puzzle, sometimes you smash her, isn't you, no,

69
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,000
ooh, we did it,

70
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,720
I can't remember, ooh, level up anyways,

71
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,200
I think Mario's good at physical, right, I'm gonna just keep physical,

72
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,640
was it you,

73
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,960
then was it you,

74
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,720
yeah,

75
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:36,720
ah, we'll boost force it, we'll boost force it,

76
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,240
oh it's glad, I'm glad to know that,

77
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,360
Malo also, was it you,

78
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,760
my memory shot, aka I didn't pay attention,

79
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:13,280
ah, was it you, oh come on,

80
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,280
it doesn't reset, right,

81
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,040
oh it reset, shit, hold on,

82
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,480
um,

83
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:46,160
I remember one of the big mouths is the the latest one, right, did I look at you,

84
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,640
shit,

85
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:06,560
memory, goldfish memory right now, oh the rain stopped,

86
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:22,000
okay, you, you, yes,

87
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,880
it's not, it's not, it's not like going straight backwards, is it, I would start crying, but

88
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,120
I swear one of these open mouths was,

89
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,520
yeah okay, it wasn't as, as, as, as kind as before,

90
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,040
yeah, I only know you were in combinations now,

91
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:01,280
okay, you, then you, I'm assuming one of you, fuck,

92
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,400
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna level up,

93
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:25,760
I'm gonna just keep leveling up, yeah, Gino, let's go, Gino was magic, right, magic

94
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,720
was like the best for him, right, I mean, I think he's supposed to be well-rounded too,

95
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:38,880
I can't, can't remember what I was looking at,

96
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,720
second from here,

97
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,880
um,

98
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,040
Gino's the glass canyon, I'm pretty sure that's also,

99
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:16,160
okay, thank you Charlie for the two, super, are you okay, yeah I'm okay,

100
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,920
of course I'm okay, I was a little madge, but you know, I'm, I'm okay,

101
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:30,240
I don't remember which one I was looking at,

102
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:45,760
chip, root force, literal root force,

103
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,640
oh, my timing was off,

104
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,640
first, first, second, middle,

105
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:18,640
the, this one, yes, this one, then this one,

106
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,760
yay, I did it,

107
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,720
found the outer key, it's over here,

108
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:42,960
wait, what's over here, oh wait, it's a fun house, so, is that a thwomp,

109
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,200
thwomp,

110
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,200
oh, there's platform here,

111
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:11,040
oops, my timing is so bad,

112
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,440
did I mention my timing's really bad,

113
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:33,680
I'm not, I'm not just crazy and going through places, right,

114
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,680
I'm not just going crazy through places, right,

115
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:49,520
okay, there's a thing here, yeah, I don't know how it goes,

116
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,960
oh, I never, I can just look right,

117
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,240
kind of chain chomp,

118
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,040
I even reached there,

119
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,880
they gaze into each other's eyes,

120
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,800
Mario, she's a bit shy, look the other way, will you,

121
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,640
you can turn around now, she says she's been locked up here ever since she took a bite out of

122
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,640
booster, so now, she wants to help us stir up a little trouble,

123
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,640
whoa,

124
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:51,440
got chain chomp, anything else here, no, no,

125
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,440
maybe I should add the new weapon,

126
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,360
equipped,

127
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,200
sure, chain chomp, wait, I don't have anything for you,

128
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,960
wait, I didn't have anything for Bowser, oh, it's okay,

129
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,840
oh, hey, we're so back, yeah, oops, forgot,

130
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,760
we're back, everyone, the weather literally changed all of a sudden,

131
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,080
I was actually quite happy about it,

132
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,000
literally, it was suddenly dead quiet, I can't believe it,

133
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,320
I'm probably gonna have to buy a surge protector though,

134
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:58,640
especially if this is a common occurrence now, usually, where I live, storms are not,

135
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:26,640
I don't trust this blue area,

136
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,640
lucky, that's a lucky,

137
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:58,640
WREXP, challenge the system, win it big or lose it all, okay, where's Yoshi,

138
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,640
yeah,

139
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,600
oh, you got zoom shoes,

140
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,480
zoomie shoes,

141
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,400
can someone who can wear that one, yeah, Bowser, have your zoomie shoes,

142
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,480
your zoomer shoes, gambling always pays off,

143
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,200
oops,

144
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,680
sure, we'll do it again,

145
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:17,680
we love gambling and shoes,

146
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,680
maybe my eyes are so fast, I saw it,

147
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:41,520
oh, shit, that was not good at all, okay,

148
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,160
oh, I can't block that, oh no, Bowser,

149
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:02,720
okay, okay, Bowser,

150
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,560
you are really enjoying this game, aren't you, Mercy, oh yeah, I am, oh yeah, I'm having a great time,

151
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,440
oh, look at you, you're going so fast, yeah, physical,

152
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:24,720
oh, we have to,

153
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,720
okay, okay, okay, okay,

154
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,720
jump,

155
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,880
oh,

156
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,000
all right, it's not gonna work on you, not bad,

157
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,000
you know, beam,

158
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,280
oh,

159
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,280
yeah,

160
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,280
oh, get up there, wow, bite you,

161
00:31:48,080 --> 00:32:02,560
I like the chest gesture,

162
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,560
yeah,

163
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,000
oh, this is my personal real life, he's so cute,

164
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,960
nice, you again, I'm amazed you made it this far, yes, quite amazing you are,

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,360
Booster's room turning, isn't he, I know hide somewhere and wait until he opens the door,

273
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:10,080
thank you, thank you Sam for the super chat, I finished your bad advice spot earlier,

274
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,600
wow that old stream, wow it was like a month ago,

275
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,120
I was wondering if you ever do a male fashion advice stream since you're a fashion designer,

276
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:34,320
let me think, I would but I feel like everyone will be mad at me about my advice,

277
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:43,600
like worse than my my advice stream, because my fashion advice would be like,

278
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,720
everybody would be like no we don't agree,

279
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,120
do it anyways,

280
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:03,920
bad advice part two electric boogaloo, I think everyone should wear banana hammocks,

281
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,040
hahaha,

282
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:15,360
tasting fashion subjective anyways, yeah pretty much like if I were to do a serious fashion thing I

283
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:22,160
would do like things like regarding face shape and like uh build I guess, and then things that

284
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:30,000
will complement that, but I also don't want to like tell people like no you can't dress like this,

285
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,660
because like, you can dress whatever the heck you want, man.

286
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:37,520
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

287
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,600
Or good advice, like cargo pants 100% of the time.

288
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:45,600
Yes, cargo pants, uh, with the, the, the,

289
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,180
the Zelda, the green Zelda shirt.

290
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:56,820
And, uh, Crocs.

291
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:57,660
Yeah.

292
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:02,660
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

293
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,480
Okay, let's continue.

294
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,540
Ha ha ha, I'm being a little silly, bolly.

295
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,780
Wait, you're just trying to get me to transition into a girl?

296
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:32,260
I would tell you to wear programmer socks and a mini skirt if I wanted you to do that.

297
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:44,380
Oh and cat ears.

298
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:48,140
Stripe socks, baby!

299
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:57,500
Honestly, honestly wear whatever you want.

300
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:02,980
I know it's a stereotype, but honestly wear whatever you want.

301
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:08,740
Seriously, it doesn't really matter unless it's like, you know, you're going to a funeral

302
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:20,420
then maybe you should probably dress a little like respectfully, you know?

303
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:27,340
But what if I already wear the stripe socks, this is over, you're already in programmer

304
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,340
hell.

305
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:41,220
Can I wear my Mario t-shirt to a funeral?

306
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:47,300
Probably not, unless like, you know, the person you're going to the funeral floor was like

307
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:55,380
yeah, wear your Mario shirt and you're in their last will.

308
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:02,540
Like my personal fashion senpai, my personal fashion especially for comfort at home is

309
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:05,540
oversized shirts and hoodies, okay?

310
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:17,060
So like I will buy oversized t-shirts and stuff and just like lounge and my shoe that

311
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:25,740
I want are like slippers.

312
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,740
That's like my personal preference.

313
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:39,380
But like if I want to like look nice and pretty when I go out I would like wear a dress and

314
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:44,300
like, I guess, I guess like I like pastel colors, yeah.

315
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,740
That's my personal preference.

316
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:58,420
But for senpais I will wear like, you know, golf, golf clothes if you want me.

317
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:06,900
But like personally, I am a slob so I would wear like a t-shirt or like a nightgown and

318
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:13,540
just be like, yeah, this is the life.

319
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,540
Do you need some advice?

320
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,540
Yeah, I need some advice.

321
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,540
Oh, I need some advice?

322
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,540
You can only move left or right and jump.

323
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,140
You can't go forward or backwards.

324
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,540
Okay, do I jump like?

325
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:31,220
Touch the sips sners or any of the bear, Rosen you'll fall back.

326
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,220
Oh shit.

327
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:39,540
Jump on the barrels or the snifters to sprint forward.

328
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:43,540
Oh, okay, like that.

329
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,540
Reach out and touch Princess Peach and you'll win flowers.

330
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:50,540
I love flowers.

331
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:54,540
Ready, set, go!

332
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,540
Oh shit.

333
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:16,540
Ah!

334
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:27,540
I suck at racing.

335
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:43,540
Oh shit.

336
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:50,540
Oh shit.

337
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:56,540
That's all you hear from me is, oh shit, oh shit, ah, oh fuck!

338
00:56:56,540 --> 00:57:07,540
Why is it red?

339
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,540
Ah!

340
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:12,540
I'm falling behind!

341
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:13,540
Ah!

342
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:22,540
There's too much visual!

343
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:29,540
Oh shit.

344
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:33,540
There's too much going on visually.

345
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:41,540
I'm having, I'm having a time.

346
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:50,540
Ah!

347
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:53,540
Cored two flowers, wow, I suck.

348
00:57:53,540 --> 00:58:00,540
I'm getting overstimulated.

349
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,540
Mercy, what type of flowers are your favorites?

350
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:04,540
I like all sorts of flowers.

351
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:12,540
I've been really into tulips lately.

352
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,540
Welcome to Marymore.

353
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:18,540
We have a lovely wedding hall and four-star hotel facilities.

354
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,540
Please enjoy your stay here.

355
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:24,540
What, you're seeking a man with a scraggly beard and weird helmet?

356
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,540
How could I forget him?

357
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:29,540
He's at the wedding hall.

358
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,540
Any more stuff here?

359
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:36,540
Stop.

360
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,540
Isn't this just splendid?

361
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,540
This place is heaven even for an origin famous.

362
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:49,540
You're safe.

363
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,540
Give me some stuff.

364
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:52,540
Hello, how may I help you?

365
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,540
I'd like to buy something.

366
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,540
Ah, buy, mid-mushroom?

367
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,540
No, don't need that.

368
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:02,540
Aw, glove.

369
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,540
Ah, double lamp.

370
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,540
That's a kick.

371
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,540
Take the chop.

372
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:11,540
No.

373
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:18,540
Happy shirt, pants, cape, shell.

374
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:28,540
Maybe we can do the happy shell.

375
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:31,540
Yeah, I won't do happy pants, too.

376
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:35,540
And a happy shirt.

377
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:44,540
Nurturing, overflow flowing with a power of love.

378
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,540
Sure?

379
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,540
I like...

380
00:59:49,540 --> 01:00:04,540
Okay, let's see what we can equip.

381
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:08,540
Booster's charm.

382
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,540
Oh, my attack goes up.

383
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,540
That's kind of nice.

384
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,540
But my speed goes down.

385
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:27,540
I want that.

386
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:32,540
Hello.

387
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:33,540
Oh, how may I help you?

388
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:37,540
I'd like to buy some things.

389
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:39,540
That's the same thing?

390
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:46,540
Okay.

391
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:47,540
Hello, honey.

392
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:52,540
Please, can we stay at the suite, please?

393
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,540
Life's known for exquisite service, especially in the suite.

394
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:58,540
That's a tad pricey.

395
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,540
I love weddings.

396
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:10,540
There's so much food that I can eat.

397
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:14,540
Hello, how may I help you?

398
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,540
Oh, the flowers.

399
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,540
It's locked.

400
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:31,540
Man.

401
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:35,540
Get up on this person.

402
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:36,540
Oh, I'm so exhausted.

403
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,540
I heard there's a casino where you get big prizes,

404
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:40,540
but I can't find a place.

405
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:45,540
It really exists.

406
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:46,540
Wedding dresses are pretty.

407
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,540
I think wedding dresses are pretty,

408
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:51,540
but I also think it's like a waste of money.

409
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:52,540
Casino?

410
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:54,540
Wait, they shouldn't have told me that

411
01:01:54,540 --> 01:02:00,540
because I would, you know?

412
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,540
And the best photographer around.

413
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:03,540
Would you like a wedding portrait?

414
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:06,540
Some people look like chefs going to the wedding hall, though.

415
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:07,540
Through the back.

416
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:12,540
Weird, huh?

417
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:15,540
Through the back, huh?

418
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:22,540
Sorry.

419
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:23,540
Looking around.

420
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:33,540
Making sure there's no goodies that I'm missing.

421
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:34,540
Okay.

422
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:36,540
We're about to begin the ceremony

423
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:39,540
when some kids in dark clothes kicked us out.

424
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:43,540
Help!

425
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:44,540
Oh, man.

426
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:46,540
Booster's weddings in progress.

427
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:47,540
We're barricading the door,

428
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:52,540
so don't even bother trying to sneak inside.

429
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:55,540
Well, that sucks.

430
01:02:55,540 --> 01:03:00,540
Hey, I think that's the one who kicked us out.

431
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:04,540
Looks like he needs to go somewhere fast.

432
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:06,540
Must be a first, a perfect couple

433
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,540
who isn't going to live happily ever after.

434
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:10,540
I give up.

435
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,540
What's the guy with the scraggly beard?

436
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,540
He and Grinch's beach shirt.

437
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:17,540
No, don't tell me they're getting married!

438
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,540
Who's the cook who blew in screaming?

439
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:21,540
It's time for my wedding!

440
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,540
Who does he think he is?

441
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,540
It's supposed to be my wedding day.

442
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,540
All my plans have been ruined.

443
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:32,540
I would probably kill someone.

444
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,540
I'd probably kill someone.

445
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:35,540
Oh, my gosh!

446
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:36,540
Me!

447
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,540
Hi!

448
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:38,540
Hey, Gigi, it looks cute.

449
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:39,540
It is cute.

450
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,540
Oh, my Mario cosplay.

451
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:42,540
What do you mean cosplay?

452
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,540
It's a me, Mercy, y'all.

453
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:47,540
This is how I always look like.

454
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:53,540
No, I'm going to fix your wedding.

455
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:57,540
Weddings are beautiful, sacred things.

456
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,540
It was my dream to stay in the suite

457
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:01,540
after we got married.

458
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,540
That's it.

459
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:22,540
Oh, that's the exit.

460
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,540
Mercy, oh, do you wax your sweet stash

461
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:26,540
or does it grow in that way?

462
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:35,540
It's 100% polyester.

463
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,540
The back way, huh?

464
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:39,540
Is this the flap?

465
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:42,540
Oh, there it is.

466
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:50,540
Found it.

467
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:54,540
Oh, cake!

468
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:57,540
Big cake for the big wedding.

469
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:00,540
It must be a masterpiece.

470
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:03,540
Yeah, the groom to be ordered something special.

471
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:06,540
Wait till he sees this.

472
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:10,540
I'm stuck.

473
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,540
I'm going to do it!

474
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:16,540
I'm going to step on the cake!

475
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:19,540
What, what, what are you doing?

476
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:20,540
Oh, that's nice.

477
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:21,540
You just stepped on the...

478
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:29,540
You fools!

479
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:32,540
I'm going to do it again.

480
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:34,540
What are you doing?

481
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,540
Oh, that's nice.

482
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,540
You just stepped on the...

483
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:39,540
You fools!

484
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:45,540
Is it just going to be repeated?

485
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:48,540
Yeah, I'm a little rascal.

486
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:53,540
What can I say?

487
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:55,540
Oh, who goes there?

488
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:57,540
Looks like Maria, but the door shut tight.

489
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:58,540
Listen, mustache.

490
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:00,540
You and your overgrown turtle friend

491
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:01,540
can take a hike.

492
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,540
Go, scat.

493
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:04,540
Scat.

494
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:07,540
Scat mansion.

495
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:09,540
Make like Maria and jump out of here.

496
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:16,540
Get lost.

497
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,540
Oops, we've got a problem.

498
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:22,540
I'm going to go tell Booster.

499
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:23,540
I'm on a bunch.

500
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:25,540
They want to help me bust the store down

501
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:26,540
on the count of three.

502
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:27,540
We run together.

503
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,540
Timing's the key.

504
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:30,540
Ready?

505
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:34,540
Here we go.

506
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,540
Sorry, but I can't let you through.

507
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:40,540
Hold on.

508
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:53,540
Am I supposed to actually...

509
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:55,540
Ain't no fucking way!

510
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:57,540
Okay.

511
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:58,540
Oh, no.

512
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:07,540
This is going to be the worst.

513
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:08,540
Oh.

514
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:17,540
Oh, we did it!

515
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:20,540
Ooh, we get to save.

516
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:21,540
Booster, sir.

517
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,540
Mario's here.

518
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,540
You clowns, don't break a door down

519
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:26,540
when entering a room.

520
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:27,540
Shut it.

521
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,540
Shut it now.

522
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:29,540
Move it.

523
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:30,540
Move it.

524
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,540
Mario, is that you, Mario?

525
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:33,540
I'm in here.

526
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:34,540
Hurry.

527
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,540
Get me out of here.

528
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:41,540
I will beach as soon as I save.

529
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:43,540
Sorry, I'm super late, Mercy.

530
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:45,540
I just got Drake to do something early.

531
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:46,540
I just got home.

532
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,540
Never apologize for being late or missing streams.

533
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:49,540
I understand.

534
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:50,540
Don't worry.

535
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:54,540
Pretty sure Mr. Mustache can't break in here,

536
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:56,540
but Turtle does look mean.

537
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:58,540
Could be trouble.

538
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:01,540
I have no idea what they're up against.

539
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,540
I'm lighting in a bottle.

540
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:05,540
I'm an earthquake in a can.

541
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:08,540
I'll open this in no time.

542
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:11,540
I have no idea what they're up against.

543
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:13,540
I'm lighting in a bottle.

544
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,540
I'm an earthquake in a can.

545
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:20,540
Open this in no time.

546
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:21,540
Oh.

547
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:34,540
Yay, we did it.

548
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:36,540
Oh, no.

549
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:39,540
No, her crown.

550
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:40,540
Ow.

551
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,540
Watch what you're doing.

552
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:43,540
I mean, ow.

553
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:44,540
Watch what you're doing.

554
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:48,540
Great.

555
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,540
I've dropped everything.

556
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:56,540
My shoes, my ring, my brooch, and my crown.

557
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:59,540
Booster, sir.

558
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,540
Booster, I am.

559
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,540
Don't bother me now.

560
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,540
Okay, everyone.

561
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,540
The bride is growing impatient.

562
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:06,540
Let the wedding begin.

563
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:08,540
Is this water coming from your eyes?

564
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:11,540
Are you licking my deer?

565
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:13,540
Is he drinking her tears?

566
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:21,540
He's drinking her tears.

567
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:22,540
Hey, salty.

568
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:31,540
Booster, sir, I believe the bride may be crying.

569
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:32,540
Crying.

570
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:34,540
Well, that's what people do when they're sad.

571
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:35,540
How disgusting.

572
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:37,540
That stuff must be curled up.

573
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:39,540
It tastes like the sea.

574
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:41,540
I wouldn't make her cry anyway.

575
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:49,540
I believe she's crying because she dropped some of her wedding gear.

576
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:52,540
Aha, of course, but those tears will ruin the cake.

577
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:54,540
Make her stop before Mario breaks in.

578
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:57,540
Wait, that's so rude of you.

579
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:59,540
Mario's already in.

580
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:02,540
Booster, sir, we need to find her things.

581
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:04,540
The wedding can't go on without them.

582
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:06,540
We're still waiting on the cake, too.

583
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:08,540
10 for a good buddy.

584
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:09,540
You find her stuff.

585
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:10,540
I'll move the ceremony forward.

586
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:11,540
Hurry.

587
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:15,540
Booster, sir, you're supposed to be on the right.

588
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,540
The bride could be on your left.

589
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:19,540
Just testing.

590
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:20,540
Like this, right?

591
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:28,540
She's still drinking her tears.

592
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:32,540
Booster, sir, I found the ring.

593
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:37,540
Booster, here's the brooch.

594
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:40,540
Booster, sir, I found the shoes.

595
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,540
Anyway, wasn't there one more thing?

596
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:45,540
You're right, the crown.

597
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:48,540
Oh, they're lighting candles.

598
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:53,540
Hurry and get back the accessory from the sniffsters and say Princess Peach.

599
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:57,540
If you're quick, something good might just happen.

600
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:01,540
Wait, how am I supposed to get it back from them?

601
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:06,540
Wait, what?

602
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:08,540
Wait, he's having the crown.

603
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:09,540
I found something, huh?

604
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:10,540
Wait a second.

605
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:11,540
I only counted zero things.

606
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:12,540
We need to find four more.

607
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:15,540
Wait, what?

608
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:18,540
Oh, oh, I just approached them.

609
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,540
Why?

610
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:20,540
Why?

611
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:35,540
Wait, what?

612
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:44,540
Did I get all of them?

613
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:54,540
Oh, he's wearing the crown.

614
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,540
Oh, here it is.

615
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:56,540
Hey, you're Mario.

616
01:11:56,540 --> 01:12:00,540
So you come to crash my wedding, I presume?

617
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:07,540
Oh, so I had to jump on him.

618
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:11,540
You're finally here.

619
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:16,540
Sorry, I took a little long.

620
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:28,540
I thought I had to jump on them or something and fight them.

621
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:31,540
What is Bowser doing here?

622
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:32,540
What a waste of time.

623
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:34,540
I got bigger fish to fry.

624
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:39,540
I know I'm getting good hands when you're around, Mario.

625
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:42,540
Here's a kiss for my hero.

626
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:45,540
Oh, isn't that just great?

627
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:47,540
Why are you going to kiss him?

628
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:50,540
But I'm the one who saved your skin.

629
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:51,540
Me too.

630
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:52,540
I want a reward.

631
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:53,540
I'll take a kiss.

632
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:54,540
Give me a kiss.

633
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:55,540
Stop it, all of you.

634
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:57,540
I'm getting so confused.

635
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:07,540
This is for you, Mario.

636
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:13,540
Aw, I get kissed from both of them.

637
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:15,540
It feels like sandpaper.

638
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:16,540
What the?

639
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:19,540
Aw, that's so cute.

640
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:21,540
Actually, I like that better, you know?

641
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:24,540
I like this better.

642
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:37,540
Can we get no cold high kisses?

643
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:44,540
Now that's for the scrapbook.

644
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:45,540
Oh, she looks happy.

645
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:46,540
Hello, Mario.

646
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:48,540
Let's get back to the Mushroom Kingdom.

647
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:56,540
The Chancellor's waiting for us.

648
01:13:56,540 --> 01:14:01,540
Sorry, I don't have to keep you waiting.

649
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:04,540
We've made the most amazing cake.

650
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,540
Wait, we made the most amazing cake.

651
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:09,540
You won't believe it.

652
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:21,540
I did play Mario, honestly.

653
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:28,540
I remember where, like, if you go in with the wedding dress, like Mario, I worked my

654
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:31,540
ass off to make sure Mario got the wedding dress.

655
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:35,540
And then Mario and then Bowser were like, you look great.

656
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:39,540
And I felt so happy at that moment.

657
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:45,540
I was like, I was so happy, you know?

658
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:52,540
It looks like a Christmas cake.

659
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:55,540
But there are a bride and groom.

660
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:59,540
There's everyone.

661
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:01,540
This is big trouble.

662
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:04,540
The bride is leaving.

663
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,540
You're taking the bride away.

664
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:09,540
But Sam won't be anyone's easy cake.

665
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:12,540
But this cannot be.

666
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:13,540
We worked hard.

667
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:15,540
We worked our day on it.

668
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,540
You fools.

669
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:22,540
I'm fighting them and the cake.

670
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:25,540
Stop it.

671
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:31,540
Stop, stop.

672
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:33,540
I'm going to hit the cake.

673
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:49,540
I'm going to hit the cake.

674
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:53,540
I love how their names tort.

675
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:55,540
I'm eating the cake.

676
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:57,540
Wait, that looks really cute.

677
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:02,540
That looks really cute, right?

678
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:04,540
That looks really cute.

679
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:10,540
The chain chop looked like it was eating the cake.

680
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,540
Anyways, I hate eggs.

681
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:14,540
So be gone, evil cake.

682
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:16,540
Wait, shit, I resisted.

683
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:18,540
Stop it.

684
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,540
Stop it.

685
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:43,540
Can I terrorize the cake?

686
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:45,540
Never mind.

687
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:48,540
Attack the cake.

688
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:53,540
Stop it.

689
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:54,540
Oh, there we go.

690
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:56,540
I got it.

691
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:08,540
Help.

692
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:11,540
Wow, this cake is like...

693
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:12,540
Wait a second.

694
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:13,540
That's not a bun cake.

695
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:14,540
You're right.

696
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:19,540
It's not.

697
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:22,540
Anyways, I hate cake.

698
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,540
I mean, I love vegan cake,

699
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:25,540
but I'm allergic to cake.

700
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:36,540
I hate cake, so I generally hate cake.

701
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:40,540
Ouch, what are you doing?

702
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:44,540
She has to hurt the cake's moving.

703
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,540
Why is this not moving?

704
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:49,540
Back to block.

705
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:54,540
No, it was moving.

706
01:17:54,540 --> 01:18:00,540
Nice jump on the cake.

707
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:01,540
Nice.

708
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:06,540
Stop it.

709
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:14,540
I'm getting better.

710
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:35,540
Out, out, now what?

711
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:39,540
Jeff Dork, the cake is moving.

712
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:42,540
Stop no more of these.

713
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:45,540
No, really, truly, why would I lie?

714
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:50,540
Because you are idiot.

715
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:57,540
See, he's not moving.

716
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:00,540
The cake is alive, run.

717
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:05,540
See, I was right.

718
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:15,540
Wait, is it actually alive?

719
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,540
Ah!

720
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:30,540
Ah!

721
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:35,540
Oh!

722
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:51,540
Oh!

723
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:56,540
Ow!

724
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:37,540
Yes!

725
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:44,540
Yes!

726
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:51,540
Ah, shit, I can't block that.

727
01:20:51,540 --> 01:21:02,540
Okay, that's fine.

728
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:06,540
Maybe we gotta wait.

729
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:09,540
This boosters wedding cake.

730
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:14,540
I don't know if we nibble on it.

731
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:17,540
Hey, number one, where's my cake?

732
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,540
Looster, sir.

733
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:22,540
Here's a 70% chance of the object you're standing on.

734
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:26,540
The cake.

735
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:30,540
This thing's a cake?

736
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:32,540
Okay, everyone, here's the stumper.

737
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:34,540
How do we eat this?

738
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:36,540
I think we boil it.

739
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,540
What do you say?

740
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:40,540
What do you do messy?

741
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:42,540
How do we even just swallow it?

742
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:44,540
What, in one gulp?

743
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:47,540
That's easier said than done.

744
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:49,540
Come on, booster.

745
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:53,540
Can you do it open wide, please?

746
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:55,540
My nerves are shot.

747
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:57,540
Oh, man, oh, man.

748
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:00,540
I feel like I've forgotten to tie my cord before a bungee jump.

749
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,540
Here it comes.

750
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:04,540
Wait, wait.

751
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:06,540
Did the cake just move?

752
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:07,540
Concentrate, sir.

753
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:11,540
I don't even feel right.

754
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:14,540
Oh, he ate it all.

755
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:17,540
Delicious.

756
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:18,540
Oh, that's so cute.

757
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:19,540
Hang on.

758
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:21,540
I feel, I'm feeling, I'm feeling.

759
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:22,540
It's good.

760
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:24,540
It makes me want to cry.

761
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:26,540
Congratulations, sir.

762
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:28,540
The wedding is now officially over.

763
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:30,540
Thanks, everyone.

764
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:31,540
It's a wrap.

765
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:36,540
Let's go.

766
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:40,540
Aw, he did it.

767
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:43,540
Cover up.

768
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:45,540
Now I can use Firepaw.

769
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:50,540
More physical.

770
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:53,540
Mahalo, reach level 10.

771
01:22:53,540 --> 01:23:01,540
Alert, shocker, magic.

772
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:03,540
That was wonderful, Mario.

773
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:06,540
You're my knight in shining armor.

774
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:09,540
Finally, let's get back.

775
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:10,540
What a day.

776
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:11,540
Can you believe it?

777
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:14,540
I almost got married to that thing.

778
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:19,540
I hope someone marries me someday.

779
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:22,540
Each princess of the Mushroom Kingdom has joined the party.

780
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:29,540
Be sure to bring her back safely.

781
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:34,540
Safely, huh?

782
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:43,540
Aw, it wasn't hard to save.

783
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:46,540
In terms of kidnapping, all of his goals were accomplished.

784
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:49,540
Was Booster more successful than Bowser?

785
01:23:49,540 --> 01:24:01,540
I mean, he got his cake, so, and ate it too.

786
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:03,540
Mario.

787
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:04,540
That creepy guy just left.

788
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,540
Does that mean we can go on with our wedding?

789
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:10,540
Oh, Raz, I'm so happy.

790
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:12,540
Let's get this wedding over with so we can stay in the suite

791
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:15,540
and then go on our honeymoon.

792
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:16,540
Let's do it.

793
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:19,540
All right, you'll have to excuse us.

794
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:20,540
Hey, everyone.

795
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:21,540
We're going to start this from the beginning.

796
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:28,540
Back inside, please.

797
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:40,540
Can I crash their wedding?

798
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:45,540
Raz, he found himself a real peach.

799
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:49,540
I can't take it anymore.

800
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:51,540
So gorgeous.

801
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:54,540
He's so beautiful.

802
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:57,540
It's lovely, isn't it?

803
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,540
Right now.

804
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:01,540
I do.

805
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:03,540
I do.

806
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:06,540
Yes, indeed.

807
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:07,540
Yes, indeed.

808
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:09,540
It's a melody of celebration.

809
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:16,540
Composed by the one and only Toad Voskey.

810
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:22,540
Oh, wait, that was Toad Voskey.

811
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:24,540
Oh, jump on him?

812
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:40,540
Let's do that, too.

813
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:46,540
What a lovely wedding.

814
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:58,540
I was like, I'm stuck between them.

815
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:01,540
Hey, what are you doing?

816
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:12,540
It's just for fun.

817
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:22,540
Oh, yeah, she does kind of scares me.

818
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:24,540
I wish people before us would hurry up.

819
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:31,540
We've been waiting for 30 minutes now.

820
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:34,540
Now the cake will stay put.

821
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:36,540
Don't worry, Chef Tork.

822
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:39,540
Don't love this.

823
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:41,540
What are you doing?

824
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:43,540
I stepped in the cake.

825
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:47,540
You fools.

826
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:50,540
You will get that play button.

827
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:52,540
How many subs is the gold button?

828
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:54,540
One million.

829
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:57,540
One million.

830
01:26:57,540 --> 01:27:01,540
It's actually like, mama was like,

831
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:04,540
mama was like, do you remember?

832
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:10,540
Do you know the meme where the girl's trying to explain something to her mother?

833
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:19,540
Mama looked like that, trying to explain what a YouTuber is to papa.

834
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:21,540
It's so funny.

835
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,540
It was funny to see.

836
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:30,540
But, um...

837
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:32,540
I think she got...

838
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:36,540
She was like, oh yeah, they talked about gold buttons and silver buttons.

839
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:42,540
There was only a gold one, so now I'm just like...

840
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:45,540
Shit.

841
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:48,540
Shit.

842
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:54,540
Like, she's getting it because she's been watching like...

843
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:59,540
She's been watching like, people explain it, right?

844
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:02,540
She's like, I don't know what you're doing, dear.

845
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:06,540
You know, I tried to explain to her what it was,

846
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:10,540
and I felt like it was wrong to be like, oh, you know...

847
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:13,540
You know, like, I'm...

848
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:18,540
It's wrong to be like, to let her continue believing that I was a teacher.

849
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:21,540
I mean, she did get that idea in.

850
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:23,540
Which is really funny, because she's been telling her friends,

851
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:26,540
she's like, oh yeah, my daughter's a YouTuber now.

852
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:29,540
And nobody's asked the channel,

853
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:32,540
which I'm a little bit grateful for.

854
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:40,540
Nobody has asked for the channel so far.

855
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:42,540
They're like, oh, that's nice.

856
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:44,540
Oh, how great of you.

857
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:48,540
How lucky you are to like, join a company doing this.

858
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:55,540
Like, literally, they're just like, oh yeah, we're really happy for you.

859
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:57,540
We're really happy for you.

860
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:00,540
This seems like such a glamorous job, but I bet it's hard work.

861
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:07,540
What's your big answer for what they do?

862
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:11,540
I would just be like, it's a secret.

863
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:14,540
Honestly, I'd probably just say it's a secret.

864
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:20,540
But like, so far, nobody's asked.

865
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:24,540
And I'm just like, a little like, oh, maybe they have a feeling

866
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:27,540
they're going to be really embarrassed about what I do.

867
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:30,540
So none of them are going to ask.

868
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:45,540
Honestly, I think it's better if they're kind of not really in the know,

869
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:49,540
like maybe just be like on the fringes of like understanding what it is.

870
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:59,540
But like, I feel like if Mama and Papa know, they would dox me like to everyone.

871
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:04,540
They would dox me to everyone.

872
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:06,540
As long as you get some privacy, right?

873
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:09,540
Yeah, privacy is not a choice.

874
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:18,540
Maybe just tell them that.

875
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:19,540
Like what?

876
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:22,540
Like I need some privacy to do it.

877
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:27,540
I like how you guys think that they respect my privacy.

878
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:33,540
But most of the things that I'm worried about,

879
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:37,540
Senpai is not the streaming stuff.

880
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:42,540
It's the side stuff that I'm worried about.

881
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:49,540
Being in the play button, won't it say Mercy Modi's channel VLR?

882
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:51,540
Yeah, but I can also order.

883
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:54,540
You can put like whatever in it, right?

884
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:58,540
I can just order another one that says like, you know,

885
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:06,540
you can customize them like you can put in like whatever for the channel name.

886
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:12,540
Like that.

887
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:16,540
So I mean it costs more to get like extras, but

888
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:26,540
I might just put like a safer work name, I guess.

889
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:27,540
On there?

890
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:30,540
Side stuff like V-tweeting?

891
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:38,540
Yeah, although I feel like I don't tweet as much as my gen mates.

892
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:42,540
That's not, I'm not saying that they're like tweeting a lot.

893
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:45,540
It's just that I hate Twitter.

894
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:47,540
I hate Twitter.

895
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:54,540
I mean it would be sad to fake the plaque name.

896
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:57,540
I'll get like two or something maybe.

897
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:02,540
X is bad.

898
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:05,540
Why are you, why are you naming?

899
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:07,540
Why are you calling it X?

900
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:09,540
Dead name it for the rest of his life.

901
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:23,540
Shitter.

902
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:31,540
I think X is like the sound in like Chinese, right?

903
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:42,540
I don't like social media.

904
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:47,540
I'm probably the most, I'm the least social media person.

905
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:48,540
Oh yeah.

906
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:54,540
It's going to be held here, absolutely gorgeous.

907
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:57,540
I came to see where the wedding is going to be held.

908
01:32:57,540 --> 01:33:00,540
For my honeymoon I was thinking of going to Seaside Town.

909
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:02,540
Oh that sounds nice.

910
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:05,540
Here, I'm sure it's ski season.

911
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:10,540
The best for a photographer, would you like a wedding portrait?

912
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:14,540
I like man and wife.

913
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:17,540
Honey, I don't want you to wander off too far now.

914
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:21,540
Oh man is it over yet?

915
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:23,540
I hate getting my picture taken.

916
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:24,540
I understand.

917
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:27,540
Okay a little closer now, ready?

918
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:29,540
Alright, one, two, hey you there.

919
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:32,540
And a long face, this is a new funeral you know.

920
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:36,540
Alright on count three say cheese.

921
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:41,540
There's those two on wonderful life, they don't fight too often.

922
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:45,540
Right down and relax.

923
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,540
It's nice to have a wedding.

924
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:52,540
Where's the guy that ran away though?

925
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:57,540
There's a little low guy that ran away.

926
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:01,540
I have photo bombing.

927
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:04,540
Besides, it's Mario, I'm practically a celebrity.

928
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:05,540
Right?

929
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,540
It's locked.

930
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:11,540
I want it not locked.

931
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:24,540
Say fuzzy pickles.

932
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:31,540
Wait, that's from, that's from, that's from the brothers game.

933
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:38,540
Actually I'm pretty, I'm looking forward to brother ship.

934
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:41,540
I know people are like, why is it called brother ship?

935
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:43,540
I'm like, isn't it cause they're on a ship?

936
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:47,540
My reaction is so plain.

937
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:50,540
Mario.

938
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:54,540
The chancellor's waiting, we're going back now right?

939
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:55,540
No.

940
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:57,540
Mario.

941
01:34:57,540 --> 01:34:59,540
Chancellor must be worried sick about us.

942
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:01,540
It's on before, come on let's go.

943
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:04,540
No.

944
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:08,540
Wait, earthbound, no right, I played earthbound.

945
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:10,540
You're right, I played earthbound.

946
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:13,540
It was like hey, fuzzy pickles and then they take the picture.

947
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:16,540
And then yeah, I remember that, shit.

948
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:20,540
You're right, that's from earthbound, I played earthbound, wow.

949
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:25,540
Mario.

950
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:29,540
Don't go to princess back, we'll be charged with kidnapping, let's go.

951
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:30,540
No.

952
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:32,540
Mario.

953
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:40,540
No one, no one is authorized to kidnap the princess except me.

954
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:42,540
Just wouldn't be right, sticker back already.

955
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:45,540
Forget it.

956
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:48,540
Enough already.

957
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:51,540
Okay, I'm going to go.

958
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:54,540
What, I can't even go there?

959
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:58,540
Forget about it.

960
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:07,540
I can't believe Bowser's being the voice of reason, it's kind of cute.

961
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:08,540
Forget about it.

962
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:14,540
Mario, welcome back, you look like you're in one piece.

963
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:17,540
Princess.

964
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:19,540
Princess.

965
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:24,540
I'm finally home with Mario and some wonderful new friends.

966
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:25,540
I'm so glad you're here.

967
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:27,540
I'm so glad you're here.

968
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:29,540
I'm so glad you're here.

969
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:31,540
I'm so glad you're here.

970
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:33,540
I'm so glad you're here.

971
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:38,540
I'm finally home with Mario and some wonderful new friends, they saved my life.

972
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:40,540
Let's go find the chancellor.

973
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:42,540
Need on.

974
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:45,540
Come Mario, we must keep the chancellor waiting.

975
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:54,540
The one piece.

976
01:36:57,540 --> 01:37:00,540
Chancellor, the princess, she's back.

977
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:05,540
Thank goodness this has been a true nightmare.

978
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:08,540
I'm nervous, I'm a nervous wreck.

979
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:14,540
I know I've worried everyone, but I'm fine, I can take care of myself.

980
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:18,540
With a little help from Mario.

981
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:25,540
Come everyone, let's get this out of the, let's get out of this drafty doorway.

982
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:34,540
Mario, I hope you know how thankful we are.

983
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:40,540
But you must tell me one thing, how on earth can you trust Bowser?

984
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:43,540
Trust Bowser?

985
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:44,540
What are you talking about?

986
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:49,540
Mario, what are you doing with?

987
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:54,540
What's going on here?

988
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:57,540
E-gads.

989
01:37:58,540 --> 01:37:59,540
E-gads.

990
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:03,540
Chancellor, listen everyone, relax.

991
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:05,540
Mario's got things under control.

992
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:08,540
Y-yes, I see.

993
01:38:10,540 --> 01:38:12,540
Bowser, perhaps this time you told us your story.

994
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:17,540
What exactly did you mean when you said, a bigger fish to fry?

995
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:22,540
Get down the truth, if this gets out, I finish.

996
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:37,540
Excuse me sir, perhaps I can set the stage, and the others can add their comments along the way.

997
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:43,540
Princess Bowser and Mario were thrown in different directions after a terrible explosion.

998
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:54,540
Something huge crashed through the star road, high above Bowser's place, and went, boom, right into Bowser's Keep.

999
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:56,540
Wait, Mario!

1000
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:04,540
What's a gigantic sword?

1001
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:09,540
Now Bowser's Keep has been taken over by monsters who work for some creep named Smithy.

1002
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:14,540
They've thrown me out of my own, I mean, I've decided to take a vacation.

1003
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:20,540
They can't do this to me.

1004
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:30,540
Anyways, I was working on a plan to get my house back when Mario walked up to me and begged me to let him join my minions.

1005
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:34,540
I had no choice but to let him in, I was pathetic.

1006
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:35,540
No, no.

1007
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:37,540
No, no.

1008
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:40,540
It's okay Mario, we know Bowser's stretching the truth a little.

1009
01:39:42,540 --> 01:39:45,540
And, Malo, what about you? Why are you traveling with Mario?

1010
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:50,540
Well, because Mario's helping me find my real home, and my parents.

1011
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:52,540
That's why we're on the road together.

1012
01:39:53,540 --> 01:39:57,540
What? That's stretch phone news? How horrible.

1013
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:59,540
I hope you find your real parents soon.

1014
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:04,540
And, um, you know, was it? Why are you and Mario?

1015
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:10,540
The Homeowners Association got him, I know, right? Why do they do that?

1016
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:13,540
Why are you taking away the home that I own?

1017
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:20,540
The Star Road has been destroyed.

1018
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:21,540
I'm here to fix it.

1019
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:26,540
Mario is helping me search for the Star Pieces. I need them to rebuild the road.

1020
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:28,540
Star Pieces?

1021
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:34,540
Star Road grants our wishes, unless we find all the Star Pieces and fix the Star Road.

1022
01:40:35,540 --> 01:40:36,540
We can kiss our dreams goodbye.

1023
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:40,540
What? This is stretch phone news? Awful, horrible.

1024
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:43,540
Mario, I'm sorry.

1025
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:45,540
I'm sorry.

1026
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:47,540
I'm sorry.

1027
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:48,540
Awful, horrible.

1028
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:54,540
Isn't it?

1029
01:40:57,540 --> 01:41:00,540
Indeed, for example, say Bowser kidnapped you.

1030
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:04,540
Without the aid of the Star Road, you probably would never be rescued.

1031
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:08,540
Actually, this sounds pretty good to me. Let's forget about the stars, things.

1032
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:13,540
Great, Bowser. Then you can just kiss your precious key goodbye.

1033
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:15,540
Oh, what?

1034
01:41:18,540 --> 01:41:21,540
Let's see if Mario can't find the stars.

1035
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:26,540
Peach will be mine, and I won't get my key back unless Mario finds the star.

1036
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:31,540
So if I want my key back, we need the star thing, but run that past me again.

1037
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:38,540
Ugh, just ignore that idiot. I don't think I could take a world, take a world without wishes.

1038
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:41,540
We need to go and find the Star Pieces now.

1039
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:43,540
It's us.

1040
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:49,540
You can't be serious, you're not. Wait, you can't be serious, you're not thinking of joining them, are you?

1041
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:54,540
It's your madness, you're a princess, what will people say?

1042
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:58,540
I don't care, things seem so hopeless right now.

1043
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:00,540
I'm tired.

1044
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:03,540
I need to lay down in my room for a while.

1045
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:10,540
Mario, Malo, Dino, and Bowser, too. Good luck.

1046
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:25,540
Now then. Thanks to Mario, the princess is back. I now declare the state to be known forever as...

1047
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:31,540
Wait a minute, you don't suppose. Could have been Smithy who attacked our kingdom.

1048
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:39,540
I feel we have no choice, no cause to rejoice. In fact, Mario must ask you yet another favor.

1049
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:49,540
Why, they always gotta make me do favor, Senpai. How many times are you... come on!

1050
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:57,540
Please, on behalf of all of us, you must defeat Smithy. The only way we'll ever live in pizza again.

1051
01:42:58,540 --> 01:42:59,540
Again, again.

1052
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:05,540
Princess home. Princess Peach is home safe, but she has to stay at the kingdom.

1053
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:17,540
I know, it's like... why is there a space up here? Can I go there one day?

1054
01:43:19,540 --> 01:43:21,540
I wanna go to Princess Peach's room.

1055
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:30,540
Princess back, I humbled myself before you. Good luck, Mario.

1056
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:38,540
I found her thingy here, which I assume are her panties. And this guy paid me off for them.

1057
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:40,540
Haha.

1058
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:45,540
Spend money on the casino.

1059
01:43:46,540 --> 01:43:52,540
Ah, you know, you know it. You know it, Senpai, we're gonna spend money, Mario.

1060
01:43:54,540 --> 01:43:55,540
Who's asking?

1061
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:07,540
Oh, Peach! Oh, she's so cute.

1062
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:12,540
Oh, Peach is always so cute.

1063
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:28,540
Please, Mario, take me with you. Take me along with you, please.

1064
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:35,540
Don't worry, Granny helped me through this one, so no one will ever notice that I'm gone.

1065
01:44:35,540 --> 01:44:36,540
Wait, that was Granny?

1066
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:42,540
That stole, that stole, that stole the panties?

1067
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:47,540
So let's find us a star.

1068
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:52,540
I wonder where it could be. I have absolutely no idea, do you?

1069
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:55,540
Mario, times like these?

1070
01:44:57,540 --> 01:44:58,540
What should we do?

1071
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:01,540
She asked my grandpa, my grandpa should know.

1072
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:03,540
Okay, then let's do it.

1073
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:07,540
This is what I thought. Peach joins the party once again.

1074
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:11,540
Yeah.

1075
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:20,540
Wait, wait, wait. Hey, Mario, I can help, don't you now.

1076
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:22,540
Progressive.

1077
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:24,540
Alright!

1078
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:25,540
He jumps faster.

1079
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:31,540
Yeah, he definitely out jumps.

1080
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:47,540
I want to jump on this kid's head.

1081
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:50,540
Come on, let me jump on his head.

1082
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:53,540
Be so fast.

1083
01:45:55,540 --> 01:45:57,540
And I'm also bad at platforming.

1084
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:23,540
Yeah!

1085
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:28,540
I got dizzy.

1086
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:33,540
He's cute.

1087
01:46:34,540 --> 01:46:36,540
Okay, let's get the watch out of here.

1088
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:40,540
Oh, I can go to Mario's house and I can get stuff, right?

1089
01:46:42,540 --> 01:46:44,540
That shout is so hyped on Kappy.

1090
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:46,540
Yeah.

1091
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:49,540
Here's my box.

1092
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:54,540
Take Max.

1093
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:56,540
Yeah.

1094
01:46:57,540 --> 01:46:58,540
Give me all my stuff.

1095
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:00,540
Okay.

1096
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:02,540
Take Max.

1097
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:04,540
Yeah.

1098
01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:06,540
Give me all my stuff.

1099
01:47:16,540 --> 01:47:17,540
Whoa!

1100
01:47:30,540 --> 01:47:32,540
Wait, this is the wrong one.

1101
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:40,540
This is the wrong one.

1102
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:42,540
Epeco high?

1103
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:43,540
A little bit.

1104
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:46,540
There it is.

1105
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:47,540
Table Pawn.

1106
01:47:47,540 --> 01:47:48,540
My bad.

1107
01:47:49,540 --> 01:47:50,540
Okay.

1108
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:52,540
Okay.

1109
01:47:53,540 --> 01:47:54,540
Okay.

1110
01:47:55,540 --> 01:47:56,540
Okay.

1111
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:58,540
Okay.

1112
01:47:58,540 --> 01:47:59,540
Come on, my bad.

1113
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:21,540
Hey Grandpa, have you heard anything about the star pieces?

1114
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:23,540
Well, what if...

1115
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:25,540
Well, if it...

1116
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:27,540
I could go.

1117
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:30,540
Whoa.

1118
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:32,540
No, I can't do it.

1119
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:35,540
I can't do an old person voice right now.

1120
01:48:35,540 --> 01:48:37,540
I'm so bad right now.

1121
01:48:38,540 --> 01:48:39,540
Well, if it isn't...

1122
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:41,540
I don't know.

1123
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:43,540
Well, if it isn't Molo,

1124
01:48:43,540 --> 01:48:47,540
I do have the latest news about falling stars, in fact.

1125
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:52,540
A large star has been sighted on Star Hill.

1126
01:48:52,540 --> 01:48:53,540
Star Hill?

1127
01:48:55,540 --> 01:48:56,540
It does sound...

1128
01:48:56,540 --> 01:48:58,540
Seemed likely that a star piece would fall there.

1129
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:02,540
We should go explore Star Hill right away.

1130
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:07,540
Star Hill, how obvious!

1131
01:49:07,540 --> 01:49:19,540
Okay, we're song?

1132
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:22,540
It's the mobile minor song.

1133
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:25,540
Hold on, I'm going to write this down.

1134
01:49:25,540 --> 01:49:26,540
Okay.

1135
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:35,540
Mi, yo, so,

1136
01:49:35,540 --> 01:49:38,540
yo, re, la,

1137
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:41,540
yi, yo.

1138
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:44,540
It's got soul!

1139
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:57,540
You want music lessons from moi?

1140
01:49:57,540 --> 01:49:58,540
Not yet.

1141
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:00,540
Well, be that way.

1142
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:04,540
Yeah, I know training continues,

1143
01:50:04,540 --> 01:50:05,540
but I'm also like,

1144
01:50:05,540 --> 01:50:08,540
oh, maybe I'm too tired for this soul right now.

1145
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:10,540
Like, I have...

1146
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:12,540
I'm like having those feelings where like,

1147
01:50:12,540 --> 01:50:14,540
oh, I'm starting to feel exhaustion.

1148
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:18,540
Welcome to Frog Hall, wine and podium.

1149
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:21,540
What are these party bracers?

1150
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:30,540
Apokola,

1151
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:32,540
or frog-like koala.

1152
01:50:43,540 --> 01:50:45,540
What can I buy with the frog coins?

1153
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:54,540
Defense, attack power, defense...

1154
01:50:55,540 --> 01:51:04,540
This sounds handy for like, the final boss.

1155
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:08,540
The EP sneaks up on you.

1156
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:10,540
Yeah, it always sneaks up on me.

1157
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:14,540
I think it's because I didn't spend like an hour before playing this.

1158
01:51:18,540 --> 01:51:20,540
And now I'm just like, oh.

1159
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:29,540
Well, there's a star place right there.

1160
01:51:35,540 --> 01:51:37,540
Oh, so pretty!

1161
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:42,540
To marry more,

1162
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:45,540
talk the flower in the gate will open.

1163
01:51:47,540 --> 01:51:49,540
Star hill.

1164
01:51:50,540 --> 01:51:52,540
This flower?

1165
01:51:56,540 --> 01:51:58,540
Oh.

1166
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:07,540
This is star hill.

1167
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:12,540
Wishes which were transformed at the star road fall to here.

1168
01:52:13,540 --> 01:52:17,540
But some wishes that haven't been granted yet are falling

1169
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:20,540
because Smithy destroyed the star road.

1170
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:24,540
The frog sage mentioned a star piece on this hill.

1171
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:27,540
Let's see if we can find it.

1172
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:36,540
Oi!

1173
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:39,540
What the fuck is that?

1174
01:52:42,540 --> 01:52:44,540
I don't trust you.

1175
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:52,540
Okay.

1176
01:53:09,540 --> 01:53:11,540
Okay, we're fine.

1177
01:53:13,540 --> 01:53:15,540
I dubbed the skeleton.

1178
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:17,540
That's a really cute name.

1179
01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:21,540
That's also really cute.

1180
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:24,540
What the heck? These are all really cute.

1181
01:53:28,540 --> 01:53:30,540
Am I missing something?

1182
01:53:31,540 --> 01:53:33,540
I hope my baby's cute.

1183
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:40,540
Can't wait to start a family.

1184
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:46,540
I wish I had some cricket jam.

1185
01:53:47,540 --> 01:53:49,540
Am I supposed to fight everyone here?

1186
01:53:49,540 --> 01:53:51,540
How come it won't open?

1187
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:58,540
I wish I weren't such a crybaby.

1188
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:00,540
This one's private!

1189
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:03,540
Who do you think you are spying on other people's wishes?

1190
01:54:03,540 --> 01:54:06,540
Come on, our quest for the star piece is important.

1191
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:09,540
Everyone's counting on us, we've got to hurry!

1192
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:14,540
Sorry about that, it's just I'm embarrassed about my wish.

1193
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:21,540
Listen here, you little shits.

1194
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:43,540
I become famous.

1195
01:54:48,540 --> 01:54:50,540
Fuck.

1196
01:54:52,540 --> 01:54:54,540
I'm a hunger roll for some food.

1197
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:01,540
Relatable.

1198
01:55:05,540 --> 01:55:08,540
I want to be a blood class becker.

1199
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:10,540
I think I know who that is.

1200
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:14,540
I think I know who that wish is for.

1201
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:20,540
Ooh, sneaky.

1202
01:55:27,540 --> 01:55:30,540
I want to be the best treasure hunter in the world.

1203
01:55:30,540 --> 01:55:32,540
Oh.

1204
01:55:44,540 --> 01:55:46,540
Please let Mao find his way home.

1205
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:50,540
Wait, please let Mao find his way home.

1206
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:54,540
Why, this wish is from my mom and dad.

1207
01:55:55,540 --> 01:55:57,540
They're wishing for me to come home.

1208
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:02,540
This isn't time to be crying.

1209
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:04,540
They're waiting for me to come home.

1210
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:06,540
Come on, Mario.

1211
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:08,540
We've got a busy schedule to keep.

1212
01:56:08,540 --> 01:56:10,540
I'll make you eat dust if you don't hurry.

1213
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:13,540
That's really sweet.

1214
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:20,540
Wait, did I go back?

1215
01:56:22,540 --> 01:56:25,540
I'm so sorry, I don't remember if I went backwards or something.

1216
01:56:26,540 --> 01:56:28,540
That was really sweet.

1217
01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:43,540
If I could only just get that melody.

1218
01:56:43,540 --> 01:56:45,540
That's Trevosky.

1219
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:47,540
I mean Tozvosky.

1220
01:56:47,540 --> 01:56:49,540
Wish I could run faster.

1221
01:56:56,540 --> 01:56:58,540
That's the Yoshi probably.

1222
01:56:58,540 --> 01:57:00,540
I can't help my older brother, Mario.

1223
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:02,540
Loloichi's wish!

1224
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:06,540
I think I found the star.

1225
01:57:23,540 --> 01:57:25,540
Yay, star piece!

1226
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:30,540
How many more left?

1227
01:57:32,540 --> 01:57:35,540
Looks like three more left.

1228
01:57:43,540 --> 01:57:46,540
So a star piece fell here after all.

1229
01:57:46,540 --> 01:57:48,540
Where to next then?

1230
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:51,540
I think there's a place called Seaside Town up ahead.

1231
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:53,540
But here it's a busy resort town.

1232
01:57:53,540 --> 01:57:56,540
So the people there might know something about it.

1233
01:57:56,540 --> 01:57:58,540
Let's go see!

1234
01:58:02,540 --> 01:58:05,540
You've come a long way, but your journey is not over yet.

1235
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:07,540
There are three more star pieces.

1236
01:58:16,540 --> 01:58:18,540
Oh, am I missing one?

1237
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:20,540
Yeah, I am.

1238
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:29,540
There you go.

1239
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:32,540
Oh, Seaside Town lets us gamble.

1240
01:58:32,540 --> 01:58:35,540
Sounds like a place where we can gamble!

1241
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:38,540
That's a tentacle!

1242
01:58:57,540 --> 01:58:59,540
That's a zombie!

1243
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:03,540
This is the end. You may stay for free.

1244
01:59:05,540 --> 01:59:07,540
Oh, pass.

1245
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:09,540
Okay.

1246
01:59:09,540 --> 01:59:11,540
Hmm.

1247
01:59:23,540 --> 01:59:25,540
This is nothing of interest here.

1248
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:27,540
Don't bother looking inside.

1249
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:36,540
Uh-huh.

1250
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:38,540
I'm gonna guess I can look inside.

1251
01:59:40,540 --> 01:59:43,540
Don't tell me you want supplies, I know.

1252
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:54,540
Poison an enemy.

1253
01:59:54,540 --> 01:59:57,540
Fear attack on a single enemy.

1254
01:59:57,540 --> 01:59:59,540
Hit all enemies with fire.

1255
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:04,540
Sure, I'll... Oh wait, 69! Nice!

1256
02:00:05,540 --> 02:00:07,540
Wait.

1257
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:10,540
These are pricey, but also 69 nice.

1258
02:00:12,540 --> 02:00:14,540
Thank you very much.

1259
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:17,540
Don't tell me you want supplies, I know.

1260
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:20,540
That's the same thing.

1261
02:00:27,540 --> 02:00:29,540
I don't know what I was just doing there.

1262
02:00:30,540 --> 02:00:34,540
Exhaustion hitting middle ocean pirate ship.

1263
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:36,540
To find out, I mean, there's a...

1264
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:42,540
Pirate lives there, his name is Jonathan Jones.

1265
02:00:42,540 --> 02:00:44,540
He isn't very nice.

1266
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:50,540
He's getting reminded, okay.

1267
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:55,540
Star falling into the sea pirate, probably.

1268
02:00:56,540 --> 02:01:01,540
I mean, that man, Jonathan Jones, probably has a nasty...

1269
02:01:05,540 --> 02:01:07,540
I hope I sound...

1270
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:11,540
I hope I sound dead inside some pie.

1271
02:01:11,540 --> 02:01:13,540
That's what I'm going for.

1272
02:01:26,540 --> 02:01:28,540
He's up there!

1273
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:31,540
We're lacking stars, right? Only three more to go.

1274
02:01:38,540 --> 02:01:42,540
Want to enter the ocean, jump into the whirlpools.

1275
02:01:45,540 --> 02:01:47,540
You'll find the village elder in his house.

1276
02:01:47,540 --> 02:01:50,540
He's the most respected person here.

1277
02:01:56,540 --> 02:02:00,540
They keep spinning and spinning.

1278
02:02:07,540 --> 02:02:09,540
Ooh, stuff.

1279
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:12,540
Things, houses.

1280
02:02:15,540 --> 02:02:18,540
Gymneys that I can't even go into? What is this?

1281
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:20,540
What is this?

1282
02:02:24,540 --> 02:02:26,540
Finally, it took me long enough.

1283
02:02:26,540 --> 02:02:28,540
I'm the outer of this village.

1284
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:33,540
I got my Exhaustion in life by leasing my superiors,

1285
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:35,540
which is something I do well.

1286
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:37,540
Stars fall into the ocean.

1287
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:39,540
I needed for a certain purpose.

1288
02:02:39,540 --> 02:02:41,540
You'll find it for me.

1289
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:47,540
There's a frog here!

1290
02:02:47,540 --> 02:02:49,540
Hello there, you're Mario, right?

1291
02:02:49,540 --> 02:02:52,540
Do you remember me? We met at Tapo Pond when I was still a tapo.

1292
02:02:52,540 --> 02:02:57,540
You turned into a little... you turned into a frog?

1293
02:02:57,540 --> 02:02:59,540
Wow!

1294
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:04,540
I've graduated from Frog Sage's School

1295
02:03:04,540 --> 02:03:06,540
and now I'm searching for the meaning of life.

1296
02:03:06,540 --> 02:03:08,540
I've been so quiet around here, it's almost eerie.

1297
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:10,540
What's going on?

1298
02:03:10,540 --> 02:03:13,540
He doesn't concern me, but if you have any frog coins I got,

1299
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:15,540
I've got some neat items to sell.

1300
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:18,540
See ya, run from battles.

1301
02:03:18,540 --> 02:03:20,540
Earlier times.

1302
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:25,540
Using this will not consume it.

1303
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:32,540
I want that! I want that!

1304
02:03:32,540 --> 02:03:35,540
I want that earlier time thing!

1305
02:03:35,540 --> 02:03:38,540
I want the earlier time thing.

1306
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:47,540
We do need frog coins!

1307
02:03:47,540 --> 02:03:49,540
Yeah, that sounds like real good, you know?

1308
02:03:59,540 --> 02:04:01,540
Big area.

1309
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:14,540
I want the battle start over thing.

1310
02:04:14,540 --> 02:04:17,540
I need two more, two more, right?

1311
02:04:23,540 --> 02:04:26,540
Did I go into every building there is?

1312
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:31,540
I feel like I should be sneaking.

1313
02:04:37,540 --> 02:04:39,540
No casinos here.

1314
02:04:44,540 --> 02:04:46,540
No gambling.

1315
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:56,540
See.

1316
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:02,540
See these nuts.

1317
02:05:02,540 --> 02:05:04,540
Oh, hi.

1318
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:06,540
I often people came around here.

1319
02:05:08,540 --> 02:05:10,540
Oh.

1320
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:17,540
Cardi's refresh during battle.

1321
02:05:20,540 --> 02:05:22,540
Super hammer.

1322
02:05:22,540 --> 02:05:24,540
Womp glove.

1323
02:05:24,540 --> 02:05:26,540
Handgun.

1324
02:05:26,540 --> 02:05:28,540
Early glove.

1325
02:05:28,540 --> 02:05:30,540
Sailor shirt.

1326
02:05:30,540 --> 02:05:32,540
Sailor pants.

1327
02:05:32,540 --> 02:05:34,540
Sailor cape.

1328
02:05:34,540 --> 02:05:36,540
Sailor dress.

1329
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:38,540
Here, have a dress.

1330
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:42,540
I want these, I don't have enough money.

1331
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:44,540
Shop here, I'll tell you this.

1332
02:05:44,540 --> 02:05:47,540
Chip sank into the briney sea because of a giant squid attack.

1333
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:50,540
People went to survey it, but they never came back.

1334
02:05:52,540 --> 02:05:54,540
Huh.

1335
02:05:55,540 --> 02:05:58,540
Pretty sure I put clothes on Bowser.

1336
02:05:58,540 --> 02:06:01,540
See, I gave him some happy shell.

1337
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:11,540
There.

1338
02:06:11,540 --> 02:06:13,540
Overflowing with power of love.

1339
02:06:14,540 --> 02:06:16,540
Therapy.

1340
02:06:25,540 --> 02:06:30,540
Think Bowser, Gino and Mario are probably the greatest.

1341
02:06:31,540 --> 02:06:33,540
Group, I guess.

1342
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:37,540
Love ring for Peach is nice.

1343
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:41,540
I love love too.

1344
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:46,540
I am big dummy because I don't know how to get over there.

1345
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:52,540
Oh, there's more over here.

1346
02:06:58,540 --> 02:07:00,540
Let's start.

1347
02:07:03,540 --> 02:07:05,540
Never mind.

1348
02:07:25,540 --> 02:07:27,540
That was my bad.

1349
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:30,540
Oh, there's the squid thing, the bloopers.

1350
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:35,540
That was my bad.

1351
02:07:39,540 --> 02:07:41,540
Yay, terrorize him.

1352
02:07:55,540 --> 02:07:57,540
Oh, shit, I missed.

1353
02:07:59,540 --> 02:08:01,540
Yeah.

1354
02:08:02,540 --> 02:08:07,540
Thank you, Buzzbun for remembering.

1355
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:09,540
Oh, I'm so eepy.

1356
02:08:09,540 --> 02:08:13,540
Can you tell that I'm getting like the eepers?

1357
02:08:21,540 --> 02:08:23,540
Oh, it's over here.

1358
02:08:26,540 --> 02:08:28,540
Oh, treasure.

1359
02:08:28,540 --> 02:08:30,540
Yeah.

1360
02:08:30,540 --> 02:08:32,540
Yay, another fraud coin.

1361
02:08:32,540 --> 02:08:35,540
We can afford starting battles over.

1362
02:08:46,540 --> 02:08:49,540
Oh, I can jump into the whirlpool.

1363
02:08:49,540 --> 02:08:54,540
What if I just want to look at things?

1364
02:08:54,540 --> 02:08:56,540
Senpai.

1365
02:08:56,540 --> 02:08:58,540
Senpai.

1366
02:08:58,540 --> 02:09:00,540
Senpai.

1367
02:09:04,540 --> 02:09:06,540
Wait, come back.

1368
02:09:06,540 --> 02:09:08,540
I need to get...

1369
02:09:08,540 --> 02:09:10,540
I need to...

1370
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:14,540
Wait, how do I unswim myself?

1371
02:09:21,540 --> 02:09:24,540
I don't want to swim anymore.

1372
02:09:28,540 --> 02:09:32,540
I just want to go back on land.

1373
02:09:32,540 --> 02:09:34,540
Let me in.

1374
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:38,540
Man.

1375
02:09:40,540 --> 02:09:43,540
I'm trying to jump out, it's not working.

1376
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:45,540
Oh, this is nice.

1377
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:47,540
I can't look at...

1378
02:09:47,540 --> 02:09:49,540
I don't want to get myself out.

1379
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:53,540
Please, let me be free.

1380
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:59,540
I can jump underwater.

1381
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:03,540
I can jump underwater.

1382
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:05,540
I can jump underwater.

1383
02:10:05,540 --> 02:10:07,540
I can jump underwater.

1384
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:09,540
I can jump underwater.

1385
02:10:09,540 --> 02:10:11,540
I can jump underwater.

1386
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:13,540
I can jump underwater.

1387
02:10:19,540 --> 02:10:21,540
Paige is from a travel log.

1388
02:10:21,540 --> 02:10:23,540
Let's take a look at it.

1389
02:10:23,540 --> 02:10:25,540
All right, done for it.

1390
02:10:25,540 --> 02:10:27,540
Giant squid just got a hold of us.

1391
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:29,540
The ship's going down fast.

1392
02:10:29,540 --> 02:10:31,540
How do I get out of here?

1393
02:10:35,540 --> 02:10:37,540
How do I jump out?

1394
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:43,540
Okay, that's nice.

1395
02:10:43,540 --> 02:10:45,540
Nice to know that works.

1396
02:11:02,540 --> 02:11:04,540
I went in here already, right?

1397
02:11:04,540 --> 02:11:06,540
Yes, I went in here already.

1398
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:08,540
Got the stuff.

1399
02:11:11,540 --> 02:11:13,540
Okay.

1400
02:11:17,540 --> 02:11:19,540
I guess I wanted to go down here.

1401
02:11:29,540 --> 02:11:31,540
Wee.

1402
02:11:32,540 --> 02:11:34,540
Oh, yeah.

1403
02:11:34,540 --> 02:11:36,540
Oh, yeah, stuff.

1404
02:11:36,540 --> 02:11:38,540
Got Max Mushroom.

1405
02:11:38,540 --> 02:11:40,540
Nice.

1406
02:11:41,540 --> 02:11:43,540
Okay.

1407
02:11:55,540 --> 02:11:57,540
Ah.

1408
02:12:10,540 --> 02:12:12,540
Ow.

1409
02:12:19,540 --> 02:12:22,540
Cowards, they really ran for me.

1410
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:32,540
There's fucking ghosts.

1411
02:12:34,540 --> 02:12:36,540
Thank you, saved point.

1412
02:12:41,540 --> 02:12:43,540
There's a page from the travel log.

1413
02:12:43,540 --> 02:12:45,540
Let's take a look at it.

1414
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:48,540
You've managed to trap the giant squid in the treasure cellar.

1415
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:51,540
The treasure will sink with the ship.

1416
02:12:51,540 --> 02:12:53,540
But so it goes.

1417
02:12:53,540 --> 02:12:55,540
Of course the ship's haunted.

1418
02:12:56,540 --> 02:12:58,540
Blah.

1419
02:12:58,540 --> 02:13:00,540
I wanted the save point.

1420
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:04,540
Got to blame the ghosts.

1421
02:13:07,540 --> 02:13:09,540
The EP, Soul EP.

1422
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:11,540
Epeist.

1423
02:13:11,540 --> 02:13:13,540
Page from travel log.

1424
02:13:13,540 --> 02:13:15,540
Okay.

1425
02:13:15,540 --> 02:13:17,540
Okay.

1426
02:13:17,540 --> 02:13:19,540
Okay.

1427
02:13:19,540 --> 02:13:21,540
Okay.

1428
02:13:21,540 --> 02:13:23,540
Okay.

1429
02:13:23,540 --> 02:13:25,540
Okay.

1430
02:13:25,540 --> 02:13:27,540
Okay.

1431
02:13:27,540 --> 02:13:29,540
Page from travel log.

1432
02:13:29,540 --> 02:13:31,540
Look at it.

1433
02:13:31,540 --> 02:13:34,540
Door to the cellar is locked with the six letter password.

1434
02:13:34,540 --> 02:13:36,540
To get inside you have to figure out

1435
02:13:36,540 --> 02:13:39,540
the password using six hints.

1436
02:13:44,540 --> 02:13:46,540
Come on.

1437
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:50,540
Can I get up there?

1438
02:13:50,540 --> 02:13:52,540
I don't think so, right?

1439
02:13:58,540 --> 02:14:01,540
Uncover the secret of the six hints.

1440
02:14:01,540 --> 02:14:03,540
Since they're provided by different people,

1441
02:14:03,540 --> 02:14:05,540
it may be tough to solve.

1442
02:14:05,540 --> 02:14:07,540
It may be impossible.

1443
02:14:07,540 --> 02:14:09,540
Oops.

1444
02:14:09,540 --> 02:14:11,540
Eugh.

1445
02:14:19,540 --> 02:14:21,540
Ooh.

1446
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:24,540
Okay, they do some pretty heavy damage, huh?

1447
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:29,540
Okay.

1448
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:36,540
Stop reaching!

1449
02:14:38,540 --> 02:14:40,540
Oh man, you are a glass cannon.

1450
02:14:40,540 --> 02:14:42,540
What the hell?

1451
02:14:50,540 --> 02:14:52,540
Get your HP up.

1452
02:14:57,540 --> 02:14:59,540
Okay.

1453
02:15:10,540 --> 02:15:12,540
Yeah.

1454
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:14,540
Thank you.

1455
02:15:28,540 --> 02:15:30,540
Whee.

1456
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:39,540
Ooh, level up.

1457
02:15:41,540 --> 02:15:43,540
He should call.

1458
02:15:44,540 --> 02:15:46,540
Oh, what's Peach good at?

1459
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:50,540
I didn't use Peach.

1460
02:15:50,540 --> 02:15:52,540
Maybe she's a magic girl?

1461
02:15:52,540 --> 02:15:54,540
Maybe she's a magic girly?

1462
02:15:57,540 --> 02:15:59,540
Okay.

1463
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:08,540
Is Amy's rat?

1464
02:16:13,540 --> 02:16:15,540
Ow.

1465
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:29,540
Okay.

1466
02:16:45,540 --> 02:16:47,540
Shit.

1467
02:16:54,540 --> 02:16:56,540
Wow, I suck at this.

1468
02:16:56,540 --> 02:16:58,540
You know what?

1469
02:17:02,540 --> 02:17:04,540
Oh.

1470
02:17:06,540 --> 02:17:08,540
Oh shit.

1471
02:17:14,540 --> 02:17:16,540
Get up.

1472
02:17:26,540 --> 02:17:28,540
I'm so epic.

1473
02:17:34,540 --> 02:17:36,540
Holy fucking shit, man.

1474
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:46,540
I am...

1475
02:17:46,540 --> 02:17:49,540
My timing is so off right now.

1476
02:17:50,540 --> 02:17:51,540
I...

1477
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:53,540
My timing is so off right now.

1478
02:17:53,540 --> 02:17:55,540
I must be that tired.

1479
02:17:56,540 --> 02:17:58,540
I must be that tired.

1480
02:18:04,540 --> 02:18:06,540
I must be that tired.

1481
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:18,540
Yeah.

1482
02:18:27,540 --> 02:18:29,540
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1483
02:18:29,540 --> 02:18:31,540
Understood.

1484
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:38,540
Let's triple one of this.

1485
02:18:40,540 --> 02:18:42,540
Whoa.

1486
02:18:56,540 --> 02:18:59,540
You need to get to a save point first, right?

1487
02:18:59,540 --> 02:19:02,540
Is Motherfucker still alive?

1488
02:19:15,540 --> 02:19:18,540
Jeez, Louise.

1489
02:19:26,540 --> 02:19:28,540
Okay.

1490
02:19:51,540 --> 02:19:55,540
I'm so glad that we have the mushroom thing.

1491
02:19:56,540 --> 02:19:58,540
Yay, coin.

1492
02:20:07,540 --> 02:20:09,540
Whoa.

1493
02:20:12,540 --> 02:20:14,540
What is that?

1494
02:20:27,540 --> 02:20:29,540
Do I like hope?

1495
02:20:44,540 --> 02:20:46,540
Oh, nice.

1496
02:20:47,540 --> 02:20:49,540
And...

1497
02:20:49,540 --> 02:20:51,540
Here's Indigo Mem...

1498
02:20:51,540 --> 02:20:53,540
Well, there's an S in the word.

1499
02:20:56,540 --> 02:20:58,540
Okay.

1500
02:21:02,540 --> 02:21:04,540
I don't know if I can continue.

1501
02:21:06,540 --> 02:21:07,540
They're like, uh...

1502
02:21:07,540 --> 02:21:09,540
What was the map system again?

1503
02:21:12,540 --> 02:21:14,540
I think maybe I'll be okay.

1504
02:21:18,540 --> 02:21:20,540
Maybe I'll be okay.

1505
02:21:26,540 --> 02:21:28,540
Okay.

1506
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:37,540
As long as we don't fucking die.

1507
02:21:43,540 --> 02:21:45,540
Yeah.

1508
02:21:57,540 --> 02:21:59,540
Okay.

1509
02:22:01,540 --> 02:22:03,540
Yeah.

1510
02:22:04,540 --> 02:22:05,540
Pull up.

1511
02:22:05,540 --> 02:22:07,540
Come on, Leo.

1512
02:22:07,540 --> 02:22:09,540
You should call.

1513
02:22:16,540 --> 02:22:18,540
What is that?

1514
02:22:19,540 --> 02:22:21,540
No.

1515
02:22:27,540 --> 02:22:29,540
Oh.

1516
02:22:32,540 --> 02:22:34,540
Okay.

1517
02:22:44,540 --> 02:22:46,540
Oh, shit.

1518
02:22:47,540 --> 02:22:49,540
Never mind, I did it.

1519
02:22:49,540 --> 02:22:52,540
Wow, I'm so smart.

1520
02:22:53,540 --> 02:22:56,540
Ventures Indigo Junior Memo.

1521
02:22:56,540 --> 02:22:59,540
It's found at the bed of the ocean.

1522
02:22:59,540 --> 02:23:01,540
Bed?

1523
02:23:23,540 --> 02:23:25,540
So what, like seaweed?

1524
02:23:28,540 --> 02:23:30,540
Oh, shit.

1525
02:23:42,540 --> 02:23:44,540
Oh, yeah.

1526
02:23:46,540 --> 02:23:48,540
There we go.

1527
02:23:52,540 --> 02:23:55,540
Six letter words, sorry.

1528
02:24:02,540 --> 02:24:05,540
Feeling we're all feeling the eepers.

1529
02:24:23,540 --> 02:24:26,540
Trying to figure out...

1530
02:24:28,540 --> 02:24:30,540
where I am.

1531
02:24:31,540 --> 02:24:33,540
Okay.

1532
02:24:40,540 --> 02:24:43,540
Wait, where am I?

1533
02:24:47,540 --> 02:24:50,540
I thought this maze was neat.

1534
02:24:50,540 --> 02:24:53,540
I just can't fucking see, man.

1535
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:58,540
Is it like...

1536
02:25:11,540 --> 02:25:13,540
Oh.

1537
02:25:13,540 --> 02:25:15,540
I got it.

1538
02:25:15,540 --> 02:25:17,540
Hee hee.

1539
02:25:20,540 --> 02:25:22,540
Okay.

1540
02:25:29,540 --> 02:25:31,540
Yeah.

1541
02:25:31,540 --> 02:25:33,540
I fucking did it.

1542
02:25:35,540 --> 02:25:37,540
Second Expedition Team Memos.

1543
02:25:37,540 --> 02:25:39,540
It has two vowels.

1544
02:25:41,540 --> 02:25:44,540
It has an S in it, two vowels.

1545
02:25:47,540 --> 02:25:49,540
And...

1546
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:51,540
the bed...

1547
02:25:51,540 --> 02:25:53,540
ocean bed.

1548
02:26:14,540 --> 02:26:17,540
Oh, I have to go over there, okay.

1549
02:26:19,540 --> 02:26:21,540
Okay.

1550
02:26:30,540 --> 02:26:33,540
How strong are dry bones?

1551
02:26:38,540 --> 02:26:40,540
Fuck!

1552
02:26:50,540 --> 02:26:53,540
Bitch isn't dying!

1553
02:27:07,540 --> 02:27:10,540
I'm hitting real hard!

1554
02:27:12,540 --> 02:27:15,540
They're immortal unless you use certain things?

1555
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:17,540
Yeah.

1556
02:27:29,540 --> 02:27:32,540
Maybe I gotta jump on them?

1557
02:27:45,540 --> 02:27:47,540
Really?

1558
02:27:55,540 --> 02:27:57,540
Really?

1559
02:28:02,540 --> 02:28:05,540
I mean, I have to take all of this?

1560
02:28:10,540 --> 02:28:12,540
I can't believe it.

1561
02:28:12,540 --> 02:28:14,540
I mean, it is a Mario game, just...

1562
02:28:14,540 --> 02:28:17,540
I didn't think that was the answer.

1563
02:28:44,540 --> 02:28:46,540
Okay.

1564
02:28:59,540 --> 02:29:01,540
Yay, level up.

1565
02:29:01,540 --> 02:29:03,540
Is this a bad guy?

1566
02:29:06,540 --> 02:29:08,540
Oh hey, it's good to see you.

1567
02:29:08,540 --> 02:29:10,540
Oh, I can buy stuff here.

1568
02:29:13,540 --> 02:29:15,540
I need some more of these.

1569
02:29:31,540 --> 02:29:33,540
Okay.

1570
02:29:46,540 --> 02:29:48,540
What do you hint?

1571
02:29:48,540 --> 02:29:51,540
The password's got something to do with the sea.

1572
02:29:51,540 --> 02:29:54,540
You don't get through all six of the obstacles.

1573
02:29:54,540 --> 02:29:56,540
You can try to deduce your way through.

1574
02:29:56,540 --> 02:29:58,540
Good luck.

1575
02:29:59,540 --> 02:30:01,540
Sand?

1576
02:30:07,540 --> 02:30:09,540
Oh shit.

1577
02:30:28,540 --> 02:30:30,540
No!

1578
02:30:30,540 --> 02:30:32,540
I think they're weak to that.

1579
02:30:47,540 --> 02:30:50,540
Money! Money, money, money!

1580
02:30:51,540 --> 02:30:53,540
Money?

1581
02:30:54,540 --> 02:30:56,540
Hey.

1582
02:31:17,540 --> 02:31:20,540
Wait! Wait, wait!

1583
02:31:20,540 --> 02:31:22,540
Shit.

1584
02:31:23,540 --> 02:31:25,540
Fuck.

1585
02:31:32,540 --> 02:31:34,540
Fuck.

1586
02:31:37,540 --> 02:31:39,540
Are these free money?

1587
02:31:53,540 --> 02:31:55,540
Did I get it?

1588
02:31:56,540 --> 02:31:58,540
Yeah.

1589
02:32:01,540 --> 02:32:03,540
Is it treasure?

1590
02:32:03,540 --> 02:32:05,540
Is it fucking treasure?

1591
02:32:05,540 --> 02:32:07,540
It's very valuable.

1592
02:32:07,540 --> 02:32:09,540
Yeah.

1593
02:32:11,540 --> 02:32:13,540
Is it treasure?

1594
02:32:14,540 --> 02:32:16,540
Is it fucking treasure?

1595
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:18,540
It's very valuable.

1596
02:32:25,540 --> 02:32:28,540
Seven letters.

1597
02:32:32,540 --> 02:32:35,540
How many letters is treasure?

1598
02:32:37,540 --> 02:32:48,380
T-R-E-A-S-U-R-E-S-8, teaser!

1599
02:32:48,380 --> 02:32:52,620
You're right, it's very valuable.

1600
02:32:52,620 --> 02:32:54,940
Ah, life!

1601
02:32:54,940 --> 02:33:08,820
It's like seven letters, has an S, valuable, it's modi-

1602
02:33:08,820 --> 02:33:10,220
Ah, it's a-

1603
02:33:10,220 --> 02:33:11,220
A-T-A-S-I?

1604
02:33:16,220 --> 02:33:17,220
Oh, shit.

1605
02:33:18,140 --> 02:33:20,140
Oh, man.

1606
02:33:25,940 --> 02:33:29,940
A shocker.

1607
02:33:49,940 --> 02:33:51,940
There we go.

1608
02:33:55,940 --> 02:33:57,940
What is this?

1609
02:34:03,940 --> 02:34:05,940
What is this?

1610
02:34:05,940 --> 02:34:30,940
What is this?

1611
02:34:30,940 --> 02:34:34,940
Get the cannonball into the boxes, but how do I do that?

1612
02:34:34,940 --> 02:34:36,940
It's like a just on their own?

1613
02:34:56,940 --> 02:34:58,940
Oh, I see.

1614
02:34:59,940 --> 02:35:00,940
I have to start over.

1615
02:35:00,940 --> 02:35:02,940
Oh, I see.

1616
02:35:02,940 --> 02:35:04,940
I understand.

1617
02:35:10,940 --> 02:35:11,940
Fuck!

1618
02:35:24,940 --> 02:35:26,940
I am an idiot!

1619
02:35:27,940 --> 02:35:28,940
Idiot!

1620
02:35:29,940 --> 02:35:34,940
What the hell?

1621
02:35:45,940 --> 02:35:49,940
Ah, that perception!

1622
02:35:54,940 --> 02:35:55,940
Yes!

1623
02:35:56,940 --> 02:35:57,940
Fuck you.

1624
02:35:59,940 --> 02:36:07,940
The fourth investigation crew memo.

1625
02:36:07,940 --> 02:36:10,940
It is actually a they.

1626
02:36:14,940 --> 02:36:16,940
It's very valuable.

1627
02:36:16,940 --> 02:36:18,940
It's found in the ocean bed.

1628
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:22,940
Oh.

1629
02:36:29,940 --> 02:36:31,940
Seven letter words?

1630
02:36:31,940 --> 02:36:32,940
Multiple?

1631
02:36:32,940 --> 02:36:33,940
Oyster sounds like a good-

1632
02:36:33,940 --> 02:36:34,940
Oh, shit.

1633
02:36:34,940 --> 02:36:36,940
Oyster sounds good, yeah.

1634
02:36:49,940 --> 02:36:51,940
Was it six letters?

1635
02:36:52,940 --> 02:36:53,940
Oh, shit.

1636
02:36:54,940 --> 02:36:57,940
I'll save point.

1637
02:36:57,940 --> 02:36:59,940
I might end here.

1638
02:37:02,940 --> 02:37:04,940
But also treasure.

1639
02:37:18,940 --> 02:37:19,940
Pearls?

1640
02:37:19,940 --> 02:37:20,940
Oh, yeah.

1641
02:37:20,940 --> 02:37:21,940
Pearls is nice.

1642
02:37:21,940 --> 02:37:23,940
Yeah, pearls.

1643
02:37:32,940 --> 02:37:35,940
Once you've come up with the key letters, speak it in here.

1644
02:37:52,940 --> 02:37:54,940
It spells it out.

1645
02:37:58,940 --> 02:38:00,940
Wait, what's the...

1646
02:38:02,940 --> 02:38:04,940
Wait, what's this?

1647
02:38:04,940 --> 02:38:06,940
How do I do this?

1648
02:38:07,940 --> 02:38:09,940
Do we know how to do this yet?

1649
02:38:12,940 --> 02:38:14,940
Wait, how do we do this puzzle?

1650
02:38:15,940 --> 02:38:17,940
Is this a lighter thing?

1651
02:38:17,940 --> 02:38:18,940
Oh.

1652
02:38:33,940 --> 02:38:36,940
Like, kick it or move it or...

1653
02:38:44,940 --> 02:38:46,940
Jump on the barrels?

1654
02:38:47,940 --> 02:38:48,940
Oh.

1655
02:38:57,940 --> 02:39:00,940
Wait, what are you even doing?

1656
02:39:13,940 --> 02:39:15,940
This is very difficult.

1657
02:39:17,940 --> 02:39:18,940
What?

1658
02:39:30,940 --> 02:39:31,940
Yay.

1659
02:39:35,940 --> 02:39:39,940
Our becomes... becomes the help.

1660
02:39:44,940 --> 02:39:46,940
We figured it out.

1661
02:39:48,940 --> 02:39:50,940
Oh, wait, I spelled it wrong.

1662
02:39:54,940 --> 02:39:55,940
Wait, P...

1663
02:39:57,940 --> 02:39:58,940
P...

1664
02:39:59,940 --> 02:40:00,940
R?

1665
02:40:02,940 --> 02:40:03,940
Wait, P...

1666
02:40:03,940 --> 02:40:04,940
Right, A.

1667
02:40:05,940 --> 02:40:06,940
What was it wrong?

1668
02:40:07,940 --> 02:40:08,940
R...

1669
02:40:10,940 --> 02:40:11,940
L...

1670
02:40:17,940 --> 02:40:19,940
That's what you're into.

1671
02:40:20,940 --> 02:40:22,940
I'm so stupid!

1672
02:40:41,940 --> 02:40:43,940
It's a PSLR.

1673
02:40:48,940 --> 02:40:49,940
Oh, my God.

1674
02:40:49,940 --> 02:40:50,940
P...

1675
02:40:54,940 --> 02:40:55,940
P...

1676
02:40:56,940 --> 02:40:57,940
A...

1677
02:41:00,940 --> 02:41:01,940
R...

1678
02:41:02,940 --> 02:41:03,940
R...

1679
02:41:04,940 --> 02:41:05,940
R...

1680
02:41:06,940 --> 02:41:07,940
R...

1681
02:41:08,940 --> 02:41:09,940
R...

1682
02:41:10,940 --> 02:41:11,940
R...

1683
02:41:12,940 --> 02:41:13,940
R...

1684
02:41:15,940 --> 02:41:16,940
R...

1685
02:41:18,940 --> 02:41:19,940
R...

1686
02:41:30,940 --> 02:41:31,940
Yeah.

1687
02:41:32,940 --> 02:41:33,940
Good job.

1688
02:41:33,940 --> 02:41:34,940
I'll let you through.

1689
02:41:34,940 --> 02:41:35,940
Get past me first, that is.

1690
02:41:35,940 --> 02:41:37,940
Pass me first, that is.

1691
02:41:43,940 --> 02:41:44,940
P...

1692
02:41:45,940 --> 02:41:46,940
Give us a second.

1693
02:41:46,940 --> 02:41:48,940
Okay, we'll do this one last battle.

1694
02:41:48,940 --> 02:41:49,940
Fuck it.

1695
02:41:53,940 --> 02:41:55,940
Hold on, give me a second, I need...

1696
02:41:57,940 --> 02:41:58,940
My team up.

1697
02:42:01,940 --> 02:42:03,940
No, wait, Malo's better in this...

1698
02:42:04,940 --> 02:42:05,940
In this fight, I think.

1699
02:42:05,940 --> 02:42:07,940
Yeah, actually, but...

1700
02:42:07,940 --> 02:42:08,940
Fuck it, we fall.

1701
02:42:13,940 --> 02:42:14,940
Okay.

1702
02:42:14,940 --> 02:42:15,940
Triple move, baby!

1703
02:42:17,940 --> 02:42:18,940
I don't care.

1704
02:42:18,940 --> 02:42:19,940
Farage?

1705
02:42:25,940 --> 02:42:27,940
Wait, this is really cute.

1706
02:42:28,940 --> 02:42:29,940
Wait, that's really cute.

1707
02:42:31,940 --> 02:42:32,940
Ah!

1708
02:42:36,940 --> 02:42:37,940
Ha ha ha!

1709
02:42:46,940 --> 02:42:48,940
Oops!

1710
02:43:16,940 --> 02:43:17,940
Ow!

1711
02:43:26,940 --> 02:43:27,940
That's so rude.

1712
02:43:37,940 --> 02:43:39,940
That's really gross!

1713
02:43:46,940 --> 02:43:47,940
I want to make Kalamari!

1714
02:43:53,940 --> 02:43:54,940
Yeah!

1715
02:43:54,940 --> 02:43:56,940
Making Kalamari was wrong!

1716
02:43:57,940 --> 02:43:58,940
You can't kill me.

1717
02:43:58,940 --> 02:43:59,940
You can't kill me.

1718
02:44:00,940 --> 02:44:01,940
I did it!

1719
02:44:02,940 --> 02:44:03,940
Yeah!

1720
02:44:03,940 --> 02:44:04,940
I did it!

1721
02:44:04,940 --> 02:44:05,940
I did it!

1722
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:07,940
I did it!

1723
02:44:07,940 --> 02:44:08,940
I did it!

1724
02:44:08,940 --> 02:44:09,940
I did it!

1725
02:44:10,940 --> 02:44:11,940
I did it!

1726
02:44:11,940 --> 02:44:12,940
I did it!

1727
02:44:12,940 --> 02:44:13,940
I did it!

1728
02:44:13,940 --> 02:44:14,940
I did it!

1729
02:44:14,940 --> 02:44:19,940
Ah, making Calamari was right!

1730
02:44:45,940 --> 02:44:48,940
Wait, where'd my buddy go?

1731
02:44:55,940 --> 02:44:57,940
Uggghhh!

1732
02:45:14,940 --> 02:45:17,940
I don't have anything with fear.

1733
02:45:23,940 --> 02:45:25,940
I don't have anything with fear.

1734
02:45:27,940 --> 02:45:29,940
Got a freebie!

1735
02:45:29,940 --> 02:45:46,940
Okay, let's get ourselves some... F.P.

1736
02:45:53,940 --> 02:45:55,940
Can't block that. Alright.

1737
02:45:59,940 --> 02:46:01,940
Okay.

1738
02:46:07,940 --> 02:46:09,940
Maybe I can switch him?

1739
02:46:20,940 --> 02:46:22,940
Oh, we'll see what P.E.S. can do.

1740
02:46:23,940 --> 02:46:25,940
F.P. group hug.

1741
02:46:25,940 --> 02:46:27,940
Yeah, group hug.

1742
02:46:29,940 --> 02:46:31,940
Okay.

1743
02:46:34,940 --> 02:46:36,940
Ugghhh!

1744
02:46:36,940 --> 02:46:38,940
Fuck.

1745
02:46:59,940 --> 02:47:02,940
Ugghhh!

1746
02:47:29,940 --> 02:47:31,940
Fuck.

1747
02:47:44,940 --> 02:47:46,940
Oh, she just slapped them! Alright!

1748
02:47:50,940 --> 02:47:52,940
Ugghhh!

1749
02:47:55,940 --> 02:47:57,940
Oh, come on, P.E.S.H.

1750
02:47:59,940 --> 02:48:01,940
Ugghhh!

1751
02:48:23,940 --> 02:48:25,940
Haha!

1752
02:48:29,940 --> 02:48:31,940
Ugghhh!

1753
02:48:50,940 --> 02:48:53,940
Can't duck that, huh?

1754
02:49:00,940 --> 02:49:04,940
Come on.

1755
02:49:04,940 --> 02:49:06,940
Ugghhh!

1756
02:49:30,940 --> 02:49:33,940
Yes, we did it!

1757
02:49:37,940 --> 02:49:39,940
Yeah!

1758
02:49:54,940 --> 02:49:56,940
What the heck is that?

1759
02:49:57,940 --> 02:50:00,940
Fuckin' rats.

1760
02:50:09,940 --> 02:50:11,940
Oh, come on.

1761
02:50:12,940 --> 02:50:14,940
Listen.

1762
02:50:27,940 --> 02:50:29,940
Fuckin' rats.

1763
02:50:33,940 --> 02:50:35,940
What's this one?

1764
02:50:37,940 --> 02:50:39,940
Okay, I wanna see what this is.

1765
02:50:42,940 --> 02:50:44,940
Ah, shit.

1766
02:50:47,940 --> 02:50:49,940
Okay, I wanna see what this is.

1767
02:50:51,940 --> 02:50:53,940
Ah, shit.

1768
02:50:56,940 --> 02:50:58,940
Ugghhh!

1769
02:51:14,940 --> 02:51:16,940
Ugghhh!

1770
02:51:20,940 --> 02:51:23,940
Fuckin' rats, they move so fast!

1771
02:51:26,940 --> 02:51:30,940
I am not lying to you when I said these rats move fast!

1772
02:51:49,940 --> 02:51:52,940
Come on. Oh, they poison you too?

1773
02:51:56,940 --> 02:51:58,940
Brutal.

1774
02:52:03,940 --> 02:52:05,940
Oh, come on.

1775
02:52:16,940 --> 02:52:18,940
Ugghhh!

1776
02:52:21,940 --> 02:52:23,940
Ugghhh!

1777
02:52:23,940 --> 02:52:25,940
Fuckin' rats!

1778
02:52:27,940 --> 02:52:29,940
Ugghhh!

1779
02:52:45,940 --> 02:52:47,940
Ah.

1780
02:52:56,940 --> 02:52:58,940
Ugghhh!

1781
02:53:27,940 --> 02:53:29,940
Oh, shit.

1782
02:53:45,940 --> 02:53:47,940
Can I not shoot it with that?

1783
02:53:57,940 --> 02:53:59,940
Easy call.

1784
02:54:10,940 --> 02:54:12,940
I wanna get up there.

1785
02:54:13,940 --> 02:54:15,940
Probably have to go to the other room.

1786
02:54:20,940 --> 02:54:24,940
Aw, man, I thought I would have a cool friend!

1787
02:54:25,940 --> 02:54:27,940
Fuck off.

1788
02:54:31,940 --> 02:54:34,940
I thought I had a cool friend!

1789
02:54:55,940 --> 02:55:01,940
I talked to myself all the time, too. Yeah, you understand.

1790
02:55:11,940 --> 02:55:14,940
She's an item, right? What was it, pure water?

1791
02:55:24,940 --> 02:55:26,940
Okay.

1792
02:55:39,940 --> 02:55:41,940
Yes, I did it.

1793
02:55:54,940 --> 02:55:58,940
I did it. I didn't even fuck up this time, this time.

1794
02:56:02,940 --> 02:56:06,940
Okay, the question is now, where do I go?

1795
02:56:08,940 --> 02:56:11,940
Oh, it's over here. Yeah.

1796
02:56:18,940 --> 02:56:20,940
Anything cool on this side?

1797
02:56:24,940 --> 02:56:26,940
Yeah.

1798
02:56:29,940 --> 02:56:31,940
A lot.

1799
02:56:54,940 --> 02:56:56,940
Bitch.

1800
02:57:24,940 --> 02:57:26,940
Ah.

1801
02:57:46,940 --> 02:57:48,940
Ugghhh!

1802
02:57:54,940 --> 02:57:56,940
Ugghhh!

1803
02:58:03,940 --> 02:58:05,940
You rude slut.

1804
02:58:17,940 --> 02:58:20,940
Aw, you slut!

1805
02:58:25,940 --> 02:58:27,940
Aw.

1806
02:58:29,940 --> 02:58:32,940
Mini Goombas were inside!

1807
02:58:54,940 --> 02:58:57,940
I got this.

1808
02:59:24,940 --> 02:59:26,940
Ugghhh!

1809
02:59:39,940 --> 02:59:45,940
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1810
02:59:48,940 --> 02:59:50,940
Yay!

1811
02:59:50,940 --> 02:59:52,940
I'm gaming!

1812
02:59:54,940 --> 02:59:57,940
How do I get that to here?

1813
02:59:59,940 --> 03:00:01,940
Oh, my client, too.

1814
03:00:06,940 --> 03:00:08,940
Oh, shit.

1815
03:00:09,940 --> 03:00:12,940
Okay, now I can jump. The other time I didn't jump.

1816
03:00:13,940 --> 03:00:15,940
Oh, shit.

1817
03:00:17,940 --> 03:00:20,940
Okay, now I can jump. The other time I didn't jump.

1818
03:00:25,940 --> 03:00:28,940
There it is.

1819
03:00:35,940 --> 03:00:38,940
Give me my stinking fraud coins!

1820
03:00:50,940 --> 03:00:53,940
Mario really has a set of lungs, huh?

1821
03:00:54,940 --> 03:00:57,940
Yeah. Aw, shit.

1822
03:00:58,940 --> 03:01:00,940
Shit.

1823
03:01:16,940 --> 03:01:20,940
Hey, I did it! I did it! I timed it correctly for once!

1824
03:01:25,940 --> 03:01:27,940
Haha.

1825
03:01:28,940 --> 03:01:30,940
Fuck.

1826
03:01:31,940 --> 03:01:33,940
Fuck.

1827
03:01:54,940 --> 03:01:58,940
He's dancing!

1828
03:02:24,940 --> 03:02:26,940
Oh, shit.

1829
03:02:39,940 --> 03:02:41,940
There we go.

1830
03:02:41,940 --> 03:02:43,940
Magic.

1831
03:03:02,940 --> 03:03:05,940
How do I get out of here?

1832
03:03:05,940 --> 03:03:08,940
Why are there the babies there?

1833
03:03:12,940 --> 03:03:14,940
I see now.

1834
03:03:23,940 --> 03:03:25,940
I would have.

1835
03:03:27,940 --> 03:03:30,940
I would literally have to fill this one.

1836
03:03:32,940 --> 03:03:34,940
You think?

1837
03:03:35,940 --> 03:03:37,940
Maybe?

1838
03:03:43,940 --> 03:03:45,940
Wait.

1839
03:03:49,940 --> 03:03:52,940
Why, stupid?

1840
03:03:53,940 --> 03:03:55,940
Oh.

1841
03:04:06,940 --> 03:04:09,940
Wait, come on. Let me jump.

1842
03:04:09,940 --> 03:04:11,940
Yeah.

1843
03:04:13,940 --> 03:04:16,940
I feel like that's blocked, right?

1844
03:04:22,940 --> 03:04:26,940
It's based behind the wall. Oh, is there?

1845
03:04:26,940 --> 03:04:29,940
I can't see.

1846
03:04:31,940 --> 03:04:35,940
Oh, yes, there is. Thank you, senpai.

1847
03:04:40,940 --> 03:04:43,940
Got safety ring.

1848
03:04:44,940 --> 03:04:47,940
The heck is a safety ring?

1849
03:04:52,940 --> 03:04:54,940
Okay.

1850
03:05:00,940 --> 03:05:03,940
Senpai, they're so smart.

1851
03:05:03,940 --> 03:05:06,940
Senpai, they're so kind helping me.

1852
03:05:07,940 --> 03:05:13,940
I'm like, so head empty. It's like, I'm so tired, but I'm gonna game.

1853
03:05:13,940 --> 03:05:15,940
Huh.

1854
03:05:18,940 --> 03:05:22,940
What's you're doing on here? Who are you?

1855
03:05:23,940 --> 03:05:29,940
What? You're looking for a star? I'll let you see stars are her.

1856
03:05:29,940 --> 03:05:31,940
Anyways, you're out of luck.

1857
03:05:31,940 --> 03:05:36,940
See, whatever falls in the sea becomes Johnny's property. Got that, matey?

1858
03:05:36,940 --> 03:05:40,940
Oh, and one last thing. Read my lips. We ain't letting you through. Got it?

1859
03:05:43,940 --> 03:05:45,940
Okay.

1860
03:06:07,940 --> 03:06:10,940
Oh, yay.

1861
03:06:13,940 --> 03:06:28,940
Alright, you're stronger than you look. Better one that project. Come on, mates.

1862
03:06:32,940 --> 03:06:37,940
I thought the boss was the squid. Alright, where's the intruder?

1863
03:06:38,940 --> 03:06:41,940
I don't see him. He can't wait.

1864
03:06:42,940 --> 03:06:44,940
There he is. Get him, boys.

1865
03:06:45,940 --> 03:06:47,940
Here, this one's on us.

1866
03:06:51,940 --> 03:06:53,940
How dare you dodge the barrel?

1867
03:06:58,940 --> 03:07:00,940
I get up here so fast.

1868
03:07:00,940 --> 03:07:03,940
It looks around now. We don't take kindly to strangers here.

1869
03:07:07,940 --> 03:07:09,940
Okay.

1870
03:07:19,940 --> 03:07:21,940
I'm so bad at the timing.

1871
03:07:31,940 --> 03:07:34,940
I'm so bad at the timing right now.

1872
03:07:35,940 --> 03:07:40,940
Pretty tough, mate. Alright, I'll let you go through to Johnny's place.

1873
03:07:49,940 --> 03:07:53,940
Yo, what? He's like a shark shark.

1874
03:07:55,940 --> 03:08:00,940
Wait, he looks like a fake shark, though. Like a skin suit shark?

1875
03:08:00,940 --> 03:08:05,940
So you're the Mario, eh? How much to look at?

1876
03:08:05,940 --> 03:08:11,940
This star fell into my sea, so it's mine. You want it, you'll have to fight for it.

1877
03:08:19,940 --> 03:08:21,940
Oh, come on.

1878
03:08:22,940 --> 03:08:24,940
Ah!

1879
03:08:28,940 --> 03:08:31,940
Come on. Pick me up.

1880
03:08:51,940 --> 03:08:55,940
Ugh. That was not gaming.

1881
03:09:21,940 --> 03:09:23,940
Okay.

1882
03:09:41,940 --> 03:09:44,940
Is there a max I could do of that?

1883
03:09:51,940 --> 03:09:53,940
No.

1884
03:10:08,940 --> 03:10:10,940
Ow.

1885
03:10:21,940 --> 03:10:36,940
Sorry, I'm so quiet because I'm so tired. I'll get there soon.

1886
03:10:36,940 --> 03:10:48,940
I don't know. That was really fun.

1887
03:10:48,940 --> 03:10:55,940
Not bad, fellas. How about it, Mario? Mario versus me. Want to mix it up?

1888
03:10:59,940 --> 03:11:01,940
Good fun. Good for you, too.

1889
03:11:01,940 --> 03:11:04,940
Oh, look alive and cheer me on.

1890
03:11:05,940 --> 03:11:07,940
What am I doing?

1891
03:11:24,940 --> 03:11:26,940
Okay.

1892
03:11:27,940 --> 03:11:29,940
No.

1893
03:11:34,940 --> 03:11:36,940
Oh, shit.

1894
03:11:37,940 --> 03:11:39,940
Oh.

1895
03:11:56,940 --> 03:11:58,940
Oh.

1896
03:12:06,940 --> 03:12:08,940
Ow.

1897
03:12:15,940 --> 03:12:17,940
Oh, I miss.

1898
03:12:19,940 --> 03:12:21,940
Shit.

1899
03:12:27,940 --> 03:12:32,940
No, I can't even do that. Okay.

1900
03:12:40,940 --> 03:12:42,940
Fuck it. Use it.

1901
03:12:56,940 --> 03:13:00,940
Yo.

1902
03:13:27,940 --> 03:13:29,940
Oh.

1903
03:13:37,940 --> 03:13:39,940
Yay.

1904
03:13:39,940 --> 03:13:41,940
Yay.

1905
03:13:42,940 --> 03:13:44,940
I did it.

1906
03:13:47,940 --> 03:13:49,940
Life.

1907
03:13:50,940 --> 03:13:52,940
I'm so tired.

1908
03:13:53,940 --> 03:13:58,940
I thought, I thought the boss, I was like, am I going to, like, just go home?

1909
03:13:58,940 --> 03:14:01,940
Like, you know, I'm impressed, matey.

1910
03:14:01,940 --> 03:14:03,940
We're in the star.

1911
03:14:03,940 --> 03:14:05,940
Like, we're in a souvenir from our fight.

1912
03:14:07,940 --> 03:14:11,940
I can't, I can't do a pirate, pirate voice right now.

1913
03:14:13,940 --> 03:14:15,940
Look at that.

1914
03:14:15,940 --> 03:14:17,940
A star.

1915
03:14:22,940 --> 03:14:24,940
A star.

1916
03:14:29,940 --> 03:14:33,940
And then there's two left. Woo.

1917
03:14:33,940 --> 03:14:36,940
Kind of feels good, huh, Senpai?

1918
03:14:40,940 --> 03:14:42,940
Are you okay?

1919
03:14:42,940 --> 03:14:44,940
Must have really wanted that star.

1920
03:14:44,940 --> 03:14:47,940
Now go on, get out of here, change my mind.

1921
03:14:47,940 --> 03:14:50,940
And he's our main man, he even fights in his sleep.

1922
03:14:50,940 --> 03:14:52,940
I don't want him anywhere.

1923
03:14:52,940 --> 03:14:54,940
Off on the trampoline in the next room.

1924
03:14:54,940 --> 03:14:56,940
Take you outside. Go on now, give it a try.

1925
03:14:56,940 --> 03:14:58,940
Okay.

1926
03:15:11,940 --> 03:15:14,940
I now need a save spot.

1927
03:15:15,940 --> 03:15:18,940
You found the star, well done.

1928
03:15:18,940 --> 03:15:20,940
But your journey ends here, you're so gullible.

1929
03:15:20,940 --> 03:15:22,940
Don't you know who I am?

1930
03:15:22,940 --> 03:15:27,940
I'm Spirovich, a member of Smithy's gang, shocked.

1931
03:15:27,940 --> 03:15:29,940
Aw, fuck.

1932
03:15:29,940 --> 03:15:33,940
No wonder my impersonation of an ordinary person was flawless.

1933
03:15:33,940 --> 03:15:36,940
Your search for the star has worried Smithy.

1934
03:15:36,940 --> 03:15:39,940
If I take that star back, I'll earn bratty points.

1935
03:15:39,940 --> 03:15:41,940
It's the way to get ahead.

1936
03:15:41,940 --> 03:15:44,940
If you're tired of trying to fight me, just hand it over nice and easy.

1937
03:15:44,940 --> 03:15:46,940
Thillius.

1938
03:15:46,940 --> 03:15:48,940
How do you want to play it?

1939
03:15:48,940 --> 03:15:51,940
What do you think will happen to the real inhabitants of the Seatown?

1940
03:15:53,940 --> 03:15:55,940
What are you doing? No, don't do that.

1941
03:15:55,940 --> 03:15:57,940
No, please stop.

1942
03:15:57,940 --> 03:15:59,940
Fuck.

1943
03:16:02,940 --> 03:16:07,940
Aw, there's an innocent shame for an innocent old man to get tickled like that.

1944
03:16:08,940 --> 03:16:11,940
Thillius.

1945
03:16:11,940 --> 03:16:13,940
Thillius.

1946
03:16:15,940 --> 03:16:17,940
No, you wouldn't do it, you're gonna...

1947
03:16:17,940 --> 03:16:19,940
No, please not there.

1948
03:16:27,940 --> 03:16:30,940
The shame, serious.

1949
03:16:31,940 --> 03:16:34,940
Heh heh.

1950
03:16:34,940 --> 03:16:37,940
Oh, if you can't cheat me this way!

1951
03:16:37,940 --> 03:16:43,940
Ah, yeeah, yeeah, yeeah, yeeah, I can't bear this!

1952
03:17:00,940 --> 03:17:03,940
I-I-I think he's dead!

1953
03:17:04,940 --> 03:17:07,940
I think he fucking died!

1954
03:17:08,940 --> 03:17:12,940
I don't think I have a choice, do I have a choice?

1955
03:17:12,940 --> 03:17:15,940
This is a false sense of choice, right?

1956
03:17:15,940 --> 03:17:18,940
Hahahahahahahahaha!

1957
03:17:20,940 --> 03:17:22,940
I don't think I have a choice.

1958
03:17:22,940 --> 03:17:24,940
Do I have a choice?

1959
03:17:24,940 --> 03:17:25,940
This is a false sense of choice, right?

1960
03:17:26,940 --> 03:17:28,940
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1961
03:17:28,940 --> 03:17:38,140
I never had a heart anyways, okay fine

1962
03:17:47,640 --> 03:17:51,900
He he he and to think I got the star without even swallowing my hands

1963
03:17:52,460 --> 03:17:55,540
Such a genius it scares me sometimes. I wonder I'm so important

1964
03:17:55,740 --> 03:17:59,940
All right, everyone listen up. We're returning to the castle. All right. I should be here about right now

1965
03:18:02,140 --> 03:18:04,620

And I think

1968
03:18:13,660 --> 03:18:16,320
That's it for today senpai

03:18:40,940 --> 03:18:42,940
Baby summer yeah, yeah

Only a summer yeah

1976
03:18:52,900 --> 03:18:58,460
Sorry about today. He's caught the storm and the storm

1977
03:19:01,780 --> 03:19:09,780
The playing hot because I don't have the surge protector or at least my search protectors over a decade old

1978
03:19:15,460 --> 03:19:21,740
Yeah, a little bit of rain and then it went away and now we are good beans

1979
03:19:21,860 --> 03:19:23,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1980
03:19:25,940 --> 03:19:27,940
Oh

03:19:37,020 --> 03:19:43,220
That I'm I might not even I might not even be able to

1983
03:19:43,860 --> 03:19:50,500
Yeah, that's how it is. I

1984
03:19:52,580 --> 03:19:55,300
Might not be able to yeah, because I'm so tired

1985
03:19:57,300 --> 03:19:59,220
But

1986
03:19:59,220 --> 03:20:01,220
Tomorrow is my SMT

1987
03:20:02,620 --> 03:20:04,620
Steam barring

1988
03:20:06,540 --> 03:20:10,340
Barring there's nothing that happens that shouldn't uh

1989
03:20:11,340 --> 03:20:13,900
It shouldn't be too bad

1990
03:20:15,460 --> 03:20:17,460
Yeah

1991
03:20:19,140 --> 03:20:24,820

I think you really enjoy it

1995
03:20:49,300 --> 03:20:58,540
Yeah, usually my membership streams are little more personal I can be a little bit more loosey-goosey than I usually am

1996
03:21:05,580 --> 03:21:07,580
As for

1997
03:21:11,340 --> 03:21:13,340
Well

1998
03:21:15,940 --> 03:21:24,940
As for the day after I have a collab with my sweet dear

1999
03:21:25,780 --> 03:21:27,780
Serenity

2000
03:21:29,540 --> 03:21:37,460
Who is who is my best friend and I'm so sorry

2001
03:21:37,620 --> 03:21:41,300
I'm so tired

2002
03:21:47,180 --> 03:21:52,500
Yeah, so we're what's the word we're going over our schedule and

2003
03:21:53,420 --> 03:21:58,020
Then after that I will have a break on Sunday

2004
03:21:59,420 --> 03:22:01,420
and then

2005
03:22:02,260 --> 03:22:04,260
Oh

2006
03:22:04,300 --> 03:22:10,380
I will post my schedule on for next week on Sunday on Sunday, so hopefully we'll

2007
03:22:10,900 --> 03:22:16,140
We'll have some fun. Yeah, I can actually use my retro take now. So

2008
03:22:16,620 --> 03:22:20,060
Yeah, we can we now look forward to next week

2009
03:22:21,380 --> 03:22:26,500
I'm gonna next week. I don't think I put Mario on the schedule. So Mario is

2010
03:22:26,620 --> 03:22:28,620
Is

2011
03:22:30,100 --> 03:22:32,100
What's the word

2012
03:22:32,220 --> 03:22:37,100
Mario is on the back burner for now

2013
03:22:39,220 --> 03:22:41,220
But we will come back

2014
03:22:42,140 --> 03:22:43,460
to

2015
03:22:43,460 --> 03:22:48,220
To Mario RPG because it's it's been great fun. It's been great fun

2016
03:22:50,020 --> 03:22:55,060
The retro tank and CRT is working. Yes, I've decided to go with

2017
03:22:56,500 --> 03:23:02,340
PS2 to for go the CRT idea for now for

2018
03:23:02,620 --> 03:23:08,140
PS2 games and instead just hook it up to my my monitor and

2019
03:23:08,820 --> 03:23:11,820
It will play smoothly. It will play

2020
03:23:12,740 --> 03:23:14,740
better than

2021
03:23:14,740 --> 03:23:15,940
then

2022
03:23:15,940 --> 03:23:17,940
What I intended

2023
03:23:18,220 --> 03:23:20,220
I

2024
03:23:24,340 --> 03:23:29,020
The we will probably be the same thing so when I start playing we games I

2025
03:23:30,620 --> 03:23:35,180
That's probably gonna be on the bucket list as well as for

2026
03:23:40,220 --> 03:23:43,020
But I will if I start playing like

2027
03:23:43,700 --> 03:23:48,580
Gamecube or something I will be on the CRT. I have it on a cart

2028
03:23:48,580 --> 03:23:50,900
I have the big CRT on the cart

2029
03:23:50,900 --> 03:23:57,180
So I'll just have to adjust everything and I'll play it on there and then connected to the PC. Yeah

2030
03:23:58,740 --> 03:24:04,100
It sounds good so my ideal was I was originally gonna play everything on CRT, but uh

2031
03:24:07,020 --> 03:24:09,020
It's difficult, you know

2032
03:24:09,900 --> 03:24:13,420
Who knows I might I might find my final way to do it anyways

2033
03:24:18,940 --> 03:24:22,340
TV cart for the CRT is big brain. It's actually like a kitchen cart

2034
03:24:22,580 --> 03:24:27,460
It's like a little kitchen cart where you're supposed to put like kitchen stuff

2035
03:24:27,860 --> 03:24:31,860
But instead I put the CRT on it so I can wheel it around

2036
03:24:32,300 --> 03:24:44,220
Thanks, we're always cooking up great content for us. I think I might not be as creative as my peers

2037
03:24:44,620 --> 03:24:46,620
but I try my best to

2038
03:24:47,420 --> 03:24:49,500
To to make things

2039
03:24:51,660 --> 03:24:58,700
Enjoyable at least I try to do it and try to make it enjoyable visually

2040
03:25:01,860 --> 03:25:03,860
Mmm

2041
03:25:09,260 --> 03:25:16,020
Hey, don't downplay yourself I feel like I'm not I'm not very creative. It's like I

2042
03:25:17,020 --> 03:25:20,220
Don't know. I don't know. I feel like a

2043
03:25:22,140 --> 03:25:24,140
Lot of this is me

2044
03:25:24,140 --> 03:25:30,420
Selfish selfish me. I want to play these games and therefore you will watch me play these games and enjoy it

2045
03:25:31,860 --> 03:25:33,860
I

2046
03:25:42,980 --> 03:25:47,980
Feel like it's like that. I I don't make a lot of events and stuff, but I'm definitely kind of like

2047
03:25:48,420 --> 03:25:50,860
Yeah, I'm I'm gonna try my best

2048
03:25:51,740 --> 03:25:57,180
to make things work and so that we can play all these games that I own and

2049
03:25:57,900 --> 03:26:00,740
I'll do like, you know every once in a while

2050
03:26:01,860 --> 03:26:07,060
Something different, right? For example, I definitely do have

2051
03:26:12,460 --> 03:26:14,460
a

2052
03:26:15,980 --> 03:26:19,380
ASMR I'm not sure if I'm gonna call it ASMR

2053
03:26:21,700 --> 03:26:24,540
Next week plan. Yeah

2054
03:26:25,140 --> 03:26:27,140
I

2055
03:26:28,740 --> 03:26:32,420
Also congrats on 6.7 K. Thank you

2056
03:26:33,540 --> 03:26:39,980
Let's make it 10. Let's make our let's make it 10 K soon

2057
03:26:48,980 --> 03:26:53,900
So close to 6.9 I want it I want it higher

2058
03:26:54,780 --> 03:26:56,780
And higher and higher

2059
03:26:58,540 --> 03:27:02,700
That's because mama mama kind of scares me right now. She's like

2060
03:27:04,300 --> 03:27:09,140
Let's make it 20 K. Fuck it. I believe in you mercy. Oh, you guys all believe in me

2061
03:27:09,660 --> 03:27:13,540
Well 69 K. That would be amazing. I would probably take a picture of that

2062
03:27:24,660 --> 03:27:26,660
Oh

2063
03:27:28,180 --> 03:27:30,740
Gotta get the play button for mama mercy

2064
03:27:32,740 --> 03:27:34,740
There's some things that I

2065
03:27:35,020 --> 03:27:41,580
Really wanted to do but I think I'll have to put things on the back burner for now because I had some things planned and then I was like, oh

2066
03:27:42,180 --> 03:27:45,020
Well, that might have to be saved for later. Oh

2067
03:27:45,820 --> 03:27:50,420
but hopefully I can play like all these retro games with some pie and

2068
03:27:51,140 --> 03:27:53,380
We'll return back to Mario soon

2069
03:27:53,380 --> 03:27:59,740
I want to also play like I want to return to like killer 7 and death mark as well

2070
03:27:59,900 --> 03:28:05,260
But you're some games that I have been on my that we've started playing but haven't yet finished

2071
03:28:07,220 --> 03:28:10,420
Any hints to tantalize us or

2072
03:28:14,020 --> 03:28:16,020
What

2073
03:28:16,580 --> 03:28:22,260
Will we get metal gear one day, I don't know it depends on my motion sickness

2074
03:28:24,460 --> 03:28:31,060
It'll be my first time playing metal gear, I don't know anything other than people are like, oh, I like this character's butt

2075
03:28:32,740 --> 03:28:38,340
Stuff you're putting on the back burner for now. Um, it's a secret

2076
03:28:42,180 --> 03:28:44,740
It's a secret but also I cannot

2077
03:28:46,180 --> 03:28:56,500
Formulate proper thoughts or cure co coherent sentences in order to explain anything or even be very clever about it

2078
03:29:04,340 --> 03:29:06,340
Thinking is hard when E.P

2079
03:29:07,060 --> 03:29:09,060
And I am the E.P.I.S.T

2080
03:29:10,020 --> 03:29:12,020
of them all

2081
03:29:12,260 --> 03:29:14,260
I'm probably gonna head out now

2082
03:29:15,220 --> 03:29:21,220
I don't see anyone on because it's pretty late right now, but I hope I get to see you guys

2083
03:29:28,900 --> 03:29:35,540
I left the Mario nose on a Maui, I mean the Mercio nose and the Mercio moustache

2084
03:29:36,420 --> 03:29:38,420
I

2085
03:29:41,940 --> 03:29:45,140
I'll see you all god next time

2086
03:29:48,260 --> 03:29:50,260
Scream for mercy

2087
03:29:52,260 --> 03:29:54,260
Bye-bye

2088
03:30:05,540 --> 03:30:08,420
You

2089
03:30:35,540 --> 03:30:37,540
