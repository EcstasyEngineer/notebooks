1
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and

2
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:19,120
Hello everyone, hello Senpai, welcome to the stream.

3
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:31,120
We're back at it again with Harvesturder.

4
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Sorry, I'm a slightly bit late, I'm slightly bit late, I had an idle meeting.

5
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:51,120
Thank you for Griffin, for the 10 gifted, and welcome to member, member, and Iago.

6
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Welcome to member, lord, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Rock.

7
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,120
Well, I can't read. How are you feeling? My arm is still itchy.

8
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:12,120
So we're going to be playing kind of, not aggressively.

9
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Now we're going to play not that aggressively.

10
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,120
Are you doing better? Let me check my arm.

11
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:27,120
There's some patches that are cleared up, but there's some parts that are still pretty bumpy and gross.

12
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:45,120
And it's, yeah, I have an appointment, I have an appointment with my doctor on Monday, that's the earliest she can see me, I think.

13
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:57,120
And so we're going to check that out, but watch as like my rash goes away by Monday.

14
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:10,120
It's LB really, it's always like that, right? It's always like that, it always, it always goes away by the time you get to the appointment.

15
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,120
But yeah, it's been a couple of days now. This morning it was flaring up really badly.

16
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:23,120
So I had to push, put my like bedsheets and stuff to the wash, so I have no blanket today.

17
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:39,120
So I've turned on, I've turned on my streaming lights, because sometimes I don't turn them on, but today I'm turning them on, so it's extra warm in the cages and in the basement.

18
00:08:39,120 --> 00:09:02,120
So we're going to continue playing, playing, I don't remember if I have anything else to say, other than I want to just double check the instructions to see if I remember it.

19
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Oh, and I got in the new mouse, the new mouse that Senpai gifted, so now I have a mouse that actually works, and not a mouse that disconnects every moment.

20
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:30,120
So now I can like move it nice. It fits my hand too.

21
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:39,120
It fits my hand, so now I've got a nice mouse to play my point and click games.

22
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Okay, let's see, left button to move.

23
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:56,120
I'm going to start on a puzzle, avoid cliches, crazy logical.

24
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,120
Okay, I think we're good.

25
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,120
Yeah, that was punch.

26
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,120
Double click to open stuff.

27
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Okay, yeah, we're good, we're good, we're good Senpai.

28
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,120
So now we just have to load our last save file.

29
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Which is Senpai, I love you, I think that's the one.

30
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,120
Now you can play a difficult game about climbing.

31
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,120
I think I was too frustrated with that.

32
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,120
Okay, nothing else in here.

33
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,120
Look at my stinking brother.

34
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Give me the paper.

35
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,120
I don't want to talk to him, but he gives so much hints.

36
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,120
He gives so much hints.

37
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,120
And twitched and drew up.

38
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,120
I guess I got my answer.

39
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
This is why I hate you.

40
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,120
Hate! Hate!

41
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Hate!

42
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
Say what?

43
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,120
Yeah, yeah, I said I hate you.

44
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Yeah, my little brother.

45
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
Little brother, hate.

46
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
Little sister.

47
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Okay, little brother, hate.

48
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,120
Hate, Trid.

49
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,120
I'm in Sparky's super foamy fire extinguisher.

50
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,120
A new boy in his sleeping soundly.

51
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,120
Hello, mother.

52
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Hello dear, how are you today?

53
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,120
You know those firemen, the funny ones with the color sense.

54
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,120
Looks like they misplaced a bolt of expensive fabric.

55
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,120
Of course, each one of them suspects the other.

56
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,120
Looks like a cat fight is brewing.

57
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
Congratulations, hero.

58
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,120
You found Karen after all.

59
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
You don't seem proud, mother.

60
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,120
You don't seem proud, yeah.

61
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,120
I warned you not to waste time looking for her.

62
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Am I running out of time?

63
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,120
The blood drive is coming soon.

64
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,120
What does that have to do with anything?

65
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Yeah, why does that have to do with anything?

66
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Thank you, Vincent, for remembering.

67
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Still, I'm glad you found the poor baby.

68
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,120
She says Mr. Potsdam was responsible for what happened to her.

69
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,120
Yeah, I knew it.

70
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,120
I can't believe Potsdam would do something.

71
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
I believe her.

72
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Shame on you.

73
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
Fuck you.

74
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,120
Imagine accusing your future father-in-law of a thing like that.

75
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,120
Is that how a rain-dryer would behave?

76
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
I don't think so.

77
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Why would she lie?

78
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
Why would she lie?

79
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Mr. Eisenheimer, even if he is a child,

80
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
molester, a kidnapper, and an attempted murderer

81
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,120
Molester, a kidnapper, and an attempted murderer?

82
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,120
What kind of father-in-law he'll be?

83
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
What?!

84
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
I just can't wait for the wedding.

85
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
What?!

86
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120

87
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

88
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,120
What do you mean that does not affect the way he's seen as a father-in-law?

89
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Also, Amy's not related.

90
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:36,780

initiation I see I see look I don't know

218
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,680
what's going on here but getting into the lodge is the best way to find out

219
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,120
by committing vandalism

220
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,680
oh he's mad at me for that huh that guy's a creep

221
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:57,360
kind of deserved it I mean everyone in town said he deserved it

222
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:06,080
it's a harmless enough prank by any means necessary

223
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,840
I thought she didn't care for the town's folk that's what I thought too

224
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,160
Stephanie what happened what happened the only town folk

225
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,720
that I care about is Karen and her mother and maybe the shopkeeper because the

226
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,640
shopkeeper kind of seemed sane everyone else is insane

227
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:34,480
mercy more of a any means necessary kind of go yeah just a little bit

228
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,320

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:49,280
sorry when you put it that way I guess I was she seemed reason

231
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,280

233
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:04,240

however many it takes to get in Stephanie if I have to use them to escape

238
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:35,120
then I will are you using them or are they using you

239
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,840
it's just a bolt of cloth you've turned the firemen against each other

240
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,040
they think one of their own stole it would you rather stay here

241
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,480
I've heard that harvest is lovely in the fall when the leaves turn orange and

242
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:55,840
oh no our first couple bickering all right all right you have a point

243
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:02,400
is it true you found Karen yep she did yeah just in time too he molested her

244
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,960
and buried her he couldn't bring himself to kill her out light so he just decided

245
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,120
to stick her in the ground and let fate take its course who would do that to a

246
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,800
helpless child she says it was mr potstown and I believe her

247
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,840
and all this time I've been under the same roof with that

248
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:31,280

330
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:51,520
believing

331
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,920
um

332
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,680
without losing your job you wouldn't be able to lock us in cages

333
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,200
yeah now I have better ways of locking senpai in cages

334
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,920
let's see my last job was

335
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:22,960
my last job was what do you call it real estate

336
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,800
it was real estate

337
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:36,320
yeah scouting out locations and all those empty houses

338
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,720
did you find the mystical free real estate no I did not

339
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,160
was it fun sort of it was fun I learned a lot

340
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,600
I learned a lot but I definitely

341
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,640
wouldn't do it again oh maybe I would or maybe I would you know if the opportunity arises I

342
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:20,160
probably would do it again if like if for some reason if for some reason I cannot make a living

343
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:28,240
here or I'm not working hard enough or something I'll probably take another additional job maybe in

344
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,640
real estate again I learned how bad the housing market is yes I learned and I learned there are

345
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:45,760
so many people who are ridiculously rich like there's some processes where when in real estate

346
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:52,160
you know you're just kind of like they're like I want to play pay the whole the whole thing now

347
00:44:52,160 --> 00:45:01,600
I'm like technically we can't sell you this without you know without some more papers

348
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,000
and then they go and then they go but I want to pay the whole thing right now in cash and I go

349
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,160
that's nice we can't do that

350
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:24,160
a full buyout yeah yeah yeah but they wanted to do in cash and that's not

351
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,080
it's really a lot of the pay paperwork would be way more complex than it is

352
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,880
and like the house that they wanted to buy was was a big house

353
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:47,280
was a big house can I say it can I say the cost of the house

354
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,520
anyways it's a big house it was uh

355
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,960
let's say it was over one million

356
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,160
it was a big house

357
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,120
and they were like I want to pay in cash and I was like

358
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:15,440
um

359
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,200
I can't do that I can't do that

360
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,960
do you get a cut of it no

361
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,520
no because I didn't sell to them

362
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:40,320
what exactly is wrong with paying in cash is because we need the paperwork and the paperwork

363
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,920
usually requires like a lot more steps than just paying out full in full cash right because you

364
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:54,000
have property and then you have the lawyer stuff and then you have bank notes and stuff and of

365
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,720
course you need like a line of credit blah blah blah blah blah it's a lot to buy a house

366
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:08,080
it's a lot to buy a house and it's like and title BS and then you have to like transfer transfer

367
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:17,760
titles and stuff the implication of paying on cash is that you don't do paperwork but the thing is

368
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:27,520
that like if I get paid in all cash it would be like you know people will start suspecting something

369
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,280
and then it will go into a whole investigation and that's another whole load of like paperwork

370
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,000
yeah

371
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:46,160
oh sorry I missed the two super chats oh I need to feed me herself now

372
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,960
I'll throw you a bone and can I stay out of the k can I stay in the cage for free now

373
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:58,240
I thought who's been paying rent should I have been charging rent for these cages

374
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,080
who's charging rent

375
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,720
the landlord me no wrong it's me

376
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:34,080
damn found out half of half of the uh half of the senpais are mysteriously gone next day

377
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,240
watch

378
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:51,680
okay I guess I guess if it's strongy if it's strongy then I guess that's okay

379
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,320
I guess it's okay

380
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,240
yeah strongy has been charging rent to fund VLR success

381
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:13,360
but I'm pretty sure I didn't I didn't charge rent that's why I've been saying that I'm so nice to you

382
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:27,200
no I've been paying I've been so nice to you I've been housing all my senpais in this cage

383
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,600
then sometimes

384
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,320
although if it is strongy then um I guess

385
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,600
I guess that it is what it is

386
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:58,320
but I saved up for a whole year to afford this one square foot cage

387
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,880
but yeah um gosh well I've been yapping right anyways um

388
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:21,120
it seems highly illegal and I don't want to like you know I don't want to be investigated for

389
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:25,920
for I don't know assisting a crime or something you know what I'm saying

390
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:32,960
senpai I don't want to I don't want to leave a trail I already know how to not leave a trail so

391
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:38,960
um why would I why would I accept one million cash you know

392
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:49,280
so yeah I was like okay well here's the steps you need to take before buying the house

393
00:50:54,240 --> 00:51:00,160
and you know that's what I did that's what I did I uh I gave them a list of what they needed to do

394
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,400
before they they could buy the house and then they never bought the house

395
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,360
and besides one more thing one more thing and uh one more thing

396
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:15,920
we don't know if the cash is real or not it could be printed printed like you know fakes

397
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:28,160
so

398
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,400
yeah like you you never know right that's why you gotta be like okay well in cash

399
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:41,840
that's kind of suspect uh so I want to go through the regular avenues for this house

400
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:53,600
so I was like no no no no no no no now

401
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,400
mercy do your best colombo impression that was my best colombo impression

402
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,640
yeah I have to follow the rules the housing market is like there's a lot of rules for housing

403
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,160
and stuff so if I don't follow all of them I get in trouble

404
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:24,400
I get in trouble otherwise but then the rules

405
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,120
then the rules you can't you can't you know

406
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:37,200
you can't really just buy a house I don't know where it is a little bit of work maybe

407
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,120
the fastest you can do is probably a day

408
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,520
but you gotta have to yeah you have you have to um

409
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:54,160
but then I'd have to work my ass off I have to work my ass off to get all the paperwork done

410
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:00,160
to do like in a day so that's that's like um

411
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:08,000
it is how it is anyways sorry me starting to think about the housing market and I'm like

412
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,800
man I want my own place and then I look at the places that like it gets sold and I'm like oh

413
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,880
I do want my own place though I do want my own place eventually so

414
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,480
I'm willing I'll be happy to do my own paperwork for that

415
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,320
oh sorry give me a second step by

416
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:43,920
I'm gonna BRB I'm gonna need I'm gonna need to go get an ice pack again to put to ice my arm

417
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,960

00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:56,480

nostalgia is a waste of time big guy you need to move forward and if you ask me the

480
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:18,160
logic lies firmly in that direction Mr. Johnson says one of my pupils scratched his priceless

481
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:24,720
Tucker I must say I was relieved when I learned he had no evidence pointing to one of my kids

482
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:31,840
if he had some lucky boy or girl would have been in for some quality time

01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,080

Sorry about that Senpai.

Sorry about that.

582
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,200
I

583
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,200
had to take

584
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,200
an idle meeting

585
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,200
while doing that too.

586
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,200
I uh,

587
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,200
what's the word? I went

588
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,200
I decided to just put the

589
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,200
ice pack back in the freezer

590
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,200
since it was melting really fast too.

591
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,200
Hahahaha

592
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,200
Did you hit, did you record it?

593
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,200
Wait what?

594
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,200
Why would I record that?

595
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,200
Hahahaha

596
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,200
Um

597
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,200
Children look stunned

598
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,200
and zombified.

599
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,200
Hahahaha

600
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,200
Senpai

601
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,200
Senpai

602
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:01,200
Check your live tag, you won't be disappointed.

603
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,200
I'll do that after stream. Thank you.

604
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,200
Hahahaha

605
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,200
Okay

606
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,200
Uh

607
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,200
What?

608
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,200
Hahahaha

609
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,200
Uh

610
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,200
Closet?

611
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,200
Can I write down closet?

612
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,200
Hahahaha

613
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,200
Uh closet?

614
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,200
Can I write down closet?

615
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,200
Hahahaha

616
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,200
We don't practice corporal punishment here.

617
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,200
I've never believed in that old adage.

618
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,200
Spare the rod and spoil the child.

619
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,200
A rod is too thin.

620
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,200
But a baseball bat

621
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:03,200
That bridges the generation gap quite nicely.

622
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,200
Okay

623
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,200
Okay, okay.

624
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,200
Stay quick

625
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,200
Not again

626
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,200
Can I, can I skip it? There we go.

627
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,200
Bye bye

628
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,200
Can I, can I grab the bat?

629
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,200
No

630
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,200
I feel like I'm supposed to do something before night time.

631
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,200
I wonder how to do that.

632
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,200
The door's locked.

633
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:41,200
Is this it?

634
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,200
No

635
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:45,200
Oof.

636
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,200
Didn't mean to do that.

637
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,200
This has to be the closet, right?

638
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,200
Try the pulse badge?

639
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:05,200
I feel like I was supposed to use the blackmail him but I uh...

640
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,200
My button

641
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,200
Why I lost that months ago, where did you find it?

642
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,200
Funny thing that

643
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,200
I found it in the ashes

644
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,200
At the newspaper building

645
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,200
What are you implying?

646
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:23,200
That I had something to do with setting the fire?

647
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,200
Preposterous.

648
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,200
Why a hundred people must have visited that site since the fire?

649
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,200
But none of them had buttons like this.

650
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,200
You just try showing that button to Sheriff.

651
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,200
Oh yeah?

652
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,200
Button

653
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,200
Wait, can I see that again? Okay

654
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,200
Bye

655
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,200
Do I still have the button?

656
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,200
Okay

657
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,200
Okay

658
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,200
Do I go to the officer then?

659
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,200
I don't know

660
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:37,200
Can I use the screwdriver?

661
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,200
Damn it

662
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:49,200
Damn it

663
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,200
Well that didn't work

664
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,200
Okay, that didn't work so

665
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,200
What else do we have?

666
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,200
A wrench

667
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,200
Okay, well that didn't work

668
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,200
Electrical tape for the wire

669
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,200
Damn it

670
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,200
Wait, where did it go? Did I put it back in myself?

671
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,200
Yeah, I did

672
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,200
Well that didn't work

673
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,200
Oh wait

674
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,200
Oh man

675
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,200
Well that didn't work

676
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,200
Maybe I can set off the alarm here

677
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,200
Well that didn't work

678
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,200
Oops, didn't mean that one

679
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,200
Okay

680
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,200
No

681
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,200
Maybe I should do this at night time

682
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,200
Maybe I should do this at night time

683
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,200
Night time, night time

684
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,200
Can I really not go on the fire station?

685
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,200
Maybe I can do it at night time

686
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,200
How do we skip time?

687
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,200
Yeah, I don't know how, I feel like I need to do something

688
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,200
Before

689
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,200
Is this the note?

690
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,200
Yeah

691
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:25,200
Yeah, this is the last guy

692
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,200
who came in

693
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:33,200
Okay

694
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,200
Okay

695
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:39,200
Well that didn't work

696
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,200
Can I take a picture of that?

697
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,200
Picture?

698
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,200
A camera, there it is

699
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:55,200
Okay

700
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,200
Well that didn't work

701
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,200
Oh man, well that didn't work

702
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,200
Ooh, lightning

703
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,200
Lightning

704
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:17,200
What if I go?

705
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,200
Just in case

706
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:37,200
Vampire

707
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,200
What if I go?

708
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,200
Where is the law?

709
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,200
I'll tell Ledger, there you go

710
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,200
Give me this

711
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,200
Can I steal stuff?

712
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,200
I want this

713
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,200
Come on

714
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,200
I want to get in here

715
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,200
Can I?

716
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,200
That is the broom closet, right?

717
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,200
It looks like that is the broom closet

718
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,200
so

719
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,200
I have to get there somehow

720
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:39,200
when he's not there

721
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,200
Mercy mutton

722
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,200
not have her tea tonight

723
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,200
because she's thirsty to get in that closet

724
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:51,200
I do have my tea

725
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,200
I do have my tea senpai

726
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:01,200
Okay, the hint is that

727
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,200
when you get to the fire station

728
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,200
I don't think we can go to the fire station

729
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,200
unless it's night time

730
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,200
Maybe I'll go back to the lodge again

731
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:11,200
and be like, what's up?

732
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,200
I've had enough of this, I'm no thief

733
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:31,200
Of course I am

734
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,200
Okay, what am I doing with the pole?

735
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:43,200
No?

736
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:47,200
Okay, so I have to steal that pole

737
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,200
What flavor is my tea?

738
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:55,200
Today's tea is, I wrote it down

739
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,200
I wrote it down senpai

740
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,200
Today's tea is

741
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:01,200
raspberry pomegranate

742
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:03,200
green tea

743
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,200
Doesn't that sound nice senpai?

744
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,200
Maybe I should make copies

745
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,200
I remember seeing like, oh you can make

746
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,200
three copies here, right?

747
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,200
Maybe I can copy all of the stuff

748
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:23,200
hotel ledger

749
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:25,200
Oh man, well that didn't work

750
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,200
No?

751
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,200
My sign meet permission?

752
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,200
Oh man

753
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,200
The note?

754
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,200
I got a copy of the note

755
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:47,200
What about this?

756
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,200
A copy of that?

757
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,200
I photocopied the badge?

758
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:03,200
Probably not

759
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,200
What about the burnt flyer?

760
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:07,200
Damn it, damn it

761
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:13,200
I'll copy of this guy?

762
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,200
Oh man

763
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:21,200
Maybe I can confront the officer now?

764
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:23,200
Oh no

765
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,200
But I want the building to

766
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:29,200
burn down

767
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:41,200
Oh, let's save

768
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,200
Or maybe not, save game

769
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,200
Senpai

770
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,200
Okay, I'm going to go in here

771
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:55,200
and see if there's anything else though

772
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,200
Vital clue in the

773
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,200
mysterious jolly fat man

774
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:01,200
murder spree

775
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:03,200
dartboard

776
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:05,200
What is that?

777
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:07,200
No, I don't know what that is

778
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,200
beer can

779
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:13,200
binoculars, fuzzy bear, wielding

780
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,200
a chainsaw

781
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,200
exhaust

782
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:19,200
No

783
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:23,200
More unsolved cases

784
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,200
More unsolved cases

785
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:27,200
Get the diner probably

786
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,200
Wait, maybe I can go like

787
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:35,200
fire

788
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,200
Nevermind

789
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,200
Door is locked

790
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:43,200
Can I just break in

791
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:45,200
to this again?

792
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:51,200
Anything else?

793
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:53,200
No

794
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:05,200
Probably at the

795
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:07,200
Oh, if he's at the diner, maybe

796
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:09,200
Oh no, he's not moved yet

797
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,200
I

798
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,200
I keep on clicking the wrong

799
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:23,200
thing

800
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,200
I was going to say Senpai again because I'm

801
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:35,200
stupid, he's not here either, what the fuck is he?

802
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,200
I can't talk now

803
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:39,200
Bye

804
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:41,200
Bye

805
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:45,200
Wait, what was that?

806
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:51,200
Okay

807
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:53,200
Not here

808
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,200
Where'd he go?

809
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:59,200
The hell?

810
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:03,200
He's here, he's getting paid off

811
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,200
No

812
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:21,200
This is the worst part about point and clicks

813
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:23,200
Sometimes you know what to do, but you

814
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:25,200
don't know how to do them

815
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:31,200
Maybe I can blackmail

816
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,200
the post office man again

817
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:35,200
Maybe

818
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,200
Hi

819
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,200
Guess what I am

820
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:59,200
Hmm

821
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:07,200
Hmm

822
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:13,200
What about the miso guy? The miso guy

823
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:15,200
will kill me, we already know that, he just

824
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:17,200
He'll kill me at any moment

825
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:21,200
Wait

826
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,200
What if I

827
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:27,200
What if I

828
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,200
Break

829
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,200
No

830
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:33,200
Okay, it's stuck to the thingy

831
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:35,200
It's here

832
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:41,200
Oh wait, there's

833
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:43,200
some lights here

834
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:47,200
Okay, I have to use

835
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:49,200
the light later

836
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:51,200
Looks like

837
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:55,200
Your tongue is pretty long, Koi

838
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,200
La la la la la

839
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:09,200
No more

840
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:11,200
to taste you with

841
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:13,200
right here

842
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:35,200
What does that tongue do?

843
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:37,200
It tastes, it has

844
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:39,200
a bunch of

845
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:41,200
areas that

846
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:43,200
Senpai

847
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:45,200
That has a

848
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:47,200
lot of taste buds in a bunch of places

849
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:49,200
and then you can taste

850
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:51,200
lots of food, yeah, thank you

851
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:53,200

my lips, your yandere, boo

855
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:01,200
tea is big, it will

856
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:03,200
cause an eclipse

857
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:05,200
You didn't rhyme

858
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:07,200
big Senpai

859
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,200
You didn't rhyme big

860
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:13,200
Try again

861
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:29,200
What the

862
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:31,200
Oh

863
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:33,200
Phew, I just thought

864
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:35,200
something was happening, I was like okay

865
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,200
Oh

866
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:47,200
Shit, don't forget to put

867
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,200
Yeah, yeah, I know

868
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:57,200
Did I check the mail?

869
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:01,200
Hmm

870
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:13,200
Is he still here?

871
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:15,200
Oh my gosh, he's still freaking

872
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,200
here, can I just

873
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:31,200
It's so weird, cause like

874
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:33,200
I'm trying to find the

875
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:35,200
sheriff and he's not around

876
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:39,200
He's not around, what the

877
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:41,200
heck did I, did I mess something up?

878
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:47,200
Yeah, I checked the cafe already

879
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:49,200
Look, look, look, look

880
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:51,200
Eat them, eat them

881
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,200
Eat them

882
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,200
See, he's not here

883
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:01,200
Where'd he go?

884
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:07,200
See, he's not there

885
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:13,200
He's not there

886
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:19,200
Howdy

887
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:23,200
And not at the fire station

888
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:25,200
We can't get into the fire station

889
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:29,200
We can't get into the fire station

890
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:33,200
This is the part of point and click

891
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:35,200
cause I don't like where I'm just like

892
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,200
okay, we have to guess

893
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:39,200
and do dumb things now

894
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:43,200
He like, we can't get in

895
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:45,200
I think we can only get in

896
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:47,200
when it's like night out

897
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:53,200
Can you give your brother the autograph photo?

898
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:55,200
I tried last time

899
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,200
and he's like, I don't care

900
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:05,200
He's literally like, I don't care

901
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:11,200
Where is it?

902
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:13,200
Oh, there it is

903
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:17,200
See, he doesn't care

904
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:19,200
Can you still pull the fire?

905
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:21,200
That's what I tried to do

906
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:23,200
but I wasn't able to do it

907
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:35,200
Okay, well I guess I'll check

908
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:37,200
the wasp lady

909
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:41,200
Military guy, okay

910
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:45,200
Okay, let's do some

911
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:47,200
some really dumb stuff

912
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:51,200
That pie, let's do some really dumb stuff

913
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:59,200
No, we start handing things

914
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,200
We start handing things over

915
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:13,200
Okay, well that's nice

916
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:15,200
Do you want anything about this button?

917
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:21,200
A triviality

918
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:25,200
Hotel ledger?

919
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:31,200
Um

920
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:33,200
Do you want some tampons?

921
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:39,200
No tampons

922
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,200
Vitamins

923
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:49,200
Moon logic time, right?

924
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:51,200
cough medicine

925
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,200
aspirin

926
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:57,200
Anything?

927
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:59,200
A pen?

928
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:01,200
Need a pen?

929
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:03,200
Need

930
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:05,200
a

931
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:09,200
A bake sale?

932
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:11,200
No

933
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:13,200
What about the

934
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:15,200
checkbook?

935
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:17,200
Okay, what about um

936
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:21,200
I don't, it's key

937
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:25,200
No?

938
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:27,200
I feel like some of these are like useless

939
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:29,200
Okay, well bye

940
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:37,200
Bye now

941
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:39,200
Wait, there's like a

942
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:41,200
I wonder if I can use the manhole cover for this

943
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:45,200
Damn it

944
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:47,200
Damn it, okay, maybe not, jeez

945
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:51,200
There's nothing else to do at the lodge?

946
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:55,200
No

947
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:59,200
He just talks about the cloth

948
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:05,200
And that's it

949
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:09,200
We must point and click further

950
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:11,200
Further

951
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:15,200
What if I give you this?

952
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:21,200
What does that sheriff told you?

953
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:23,200
The sheriff said calm down

954
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:25,200
No

955
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:29,200
I

956
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:41,200
I didn't soft lock myself, right?

957
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:51,200
We didn't soft lock ourselves, right?

958
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:53,200
The diner?

959
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:55,200
Oops

960
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:57,200
That's the TV station, my bad

961
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:01,200
Oh, that's another Tucker, you're right

962
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:03,200
There, oh my gosh, he's right

963
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:05,200
There's like a ton of Tucker's

964
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:15,200
I always like those like blue stuff

965
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:23,200
I can't talk

966
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:25,200
Bye

967
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:39,200
Oh, I'm supposed to give the cloth

968
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:43,200
Wait, I was

969
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:45,200
Drawer on the left, hold on

970
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:47,200
I was supposed to give the cloth to him

971
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:49,200
I thought he already

972
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:51,200
You know what, never mind

973
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:55,200
Locked door

974
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:57,200
What's this?

975
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:03,200
Oh

976
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:07,200
I didn't know

977
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:09,200
Alright, is the cloth still in your inventory?

978
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:17,200
No, I don't think so, I think he took it

979
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:19,200
I think he took it

980
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:25,200
Yeah, he took it

981
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:31,200
Strawny asked if I'll keep streaming

982
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:33,200
for another hour

983
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:35,200
Likely

984
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:37,200
I got a screwdriver, yeah

985
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:39,200
Thank you for the hand

986
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:41,200
Thank you for the hand senpai

987
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:43,200
That was hard to see

988
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:45,200
Oh

989
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:49,200
Okay, well, it's night time

990
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:57,200
It's night time, yay

991
01:51:57,200 --> 01:51:59,200
Finally, progress

992
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:03,200
We're gonna break into the fire station

993
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:15,200
Oh, shit

994
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:17,200
He's dead

995
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,200
Do I have the cloth?

996
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:27,200
Can I fix it?

997
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:29,200
Can I fix this?

998
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:31,200
No

999
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:33,200
I don't have the cloth anymore, I can't fix this

1000
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:37,200
I can't fix it

1001
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:39,200
Let's

1002
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:41,200
Meat plant

1003
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:43,200
Oh, yeah

1004
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:45,200
Okay, time

1005
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:47,200
I did the boba shop

1006
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:51,200
Barber shop is closed

1007
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:03,200
Save

1008
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:07,200
Yeah

1009
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:09,200
Okay

1010
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:11,200
We break in

1011
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:13,200
with the wrench

1012
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:15,200
No

1013
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:17,200
I must have put that in

1014
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:21,200
That's not how exactly a professional would break in

1015
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:23,200
What do you mean?

1016
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:27,200
What do you mean that's not how a professional would break in?

1017
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:35,200
Are you serious?

1018
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:39,200
Are you serious?

1019
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:43,200
Are you serious?

1020
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:49,200
Damn

1021
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:53,200
Except for the occasional hairball coughs

1022
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:57,200
Can I

1023
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:01,200
Unscrew this

1024
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:05,200
Yay, no

1025
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:07,200
No, I got caught

1026
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:11,200
I got caught

1027
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:17,200
Oh, no

1028
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:21,200
Okay, okay

1029
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:23,200
Well, I'm gonna lull the game again

1030
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:25,200
Good thing I saved

1031
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:27,200
We saved scum in this house

1032
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:29,200
Or in this basement

1033
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:31,200
Not the law

1034
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:33,200
Okay, first I put electric tape

1035
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,200
On the door

1036
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:37,200
And I break in

1037
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:39,200
So that it doesn't arouse suspicion

1038
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:45,200
Senpai

1039
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:47,200
Senpai

1040
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:51,200
Thank you for the five

1041
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:53,200
I give you affection

1042
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:55,200
Can I come out of the cage for a little bit now?

1043
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:59,200
Maybe I have to turn

1044
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:01,200
Okay

1045
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:03,200
Oh

1046
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:05,200
I got it

1047
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:07,200
I got it

1048
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:17,200
Yeah

1049
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:19,200
I did it

1050
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:29,200
I did it

1051
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:35,200
School time now, hopefully

1052
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:39,200
I want to go to the school

1053
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:43,200
I'm breaking into the broom closet

1054
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:45,200
Let me in

1055
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:49,200
Let me in

1056
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:57,200
Why do you sleep in jeans?

1057
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:03,200
I want to pee, yeah, I want to pee

1058
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:11,200
But also, why does this man sleep in jeans?

1059
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:15,200
What do people want from me?

1060
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:19,200
I want to pee

1061
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:21,200
I want to pee

1062
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:27,200
I don't think so

1063
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:31,200
The most I sleep in

1064
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:33,200
Is like

1065
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:35,200

01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:37,200
I have a bunch of sleeping t-shirts

1067
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:39,200
On colder days though

1068
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:41,200
On really cold days

1069
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:43,200
I wear like, fleece jammies

1070
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:49,200
What the hell is this?

1071
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:59,200
What the hell is this?

1072
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:03,200

1073
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:07,200

01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:11,200

01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:25,200
What the fuck does this say?

1081
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:29,200

Second disc time

1084
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:35,200
What do you mean second disc?

1085
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:41,200
What does this say? Hold on

1086
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:43,200

Did it work?

1092
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:07,200
Hello?

1093
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:13,200
Hello?

1094
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:31,200
Did I mess up Senpai?

1095
01:58:35,200 --> 01:58:37,200
I don't have a second disc

1096
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:39,200
I bought this on Steam

1097
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:43,200
I bought on Steam

1098
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:45,200
There's no second disc

1099
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:51,200
Senpai save me

1100
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:53,200
Save me

1101
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:13,200
Whoa

1102
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:15,200
Wait it worked

1103
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:19,200
We're saved Senpai

1104
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:27,200
Yeah

1105
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,200
I don't know how I did it

1106
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:31,200
I just kept doing it

1107
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:33,200

1108
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:37,200

1110
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:51,200
Save game

1111
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:53,200
It worked eventually

1112
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:55,200
We bought those

1113
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:57,200
We um

1114
01:59:57,200 --> 02:00:01,200
Wait is it still saying it at the bottom?

1115
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:07,200
Wait the bottom still says

1116
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:13,200
Save game

1117
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:21,200
It's okay we'll just leave it there

1118
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:29,200
Now we'll just leave it there

1119
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:31,200
I'm not gonna risk anything

1120
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:33,200
Leave me alone

1121
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:37,200
Bye

1122
02:00:37,200 --> 02:00:39,200
Good finally

1123
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:43,200
Okay you know what never mind

1124
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:45,200
We might have to close it

1125
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:47,200
Yeah we might have to close it

1126
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:49,200
Look it's stuck now Senpai

1127
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:51,200
It's stuck now

1128
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:53,200
Did I save? I saved

1129
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:57,200
Oh wait no no no

1130
02:00:57,200 --> 02:00:59,200
I fixed it I hit exit again

1131
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:01,200
We're good

1132
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:09,200
Did you hear what happened at the barber shop?

1133
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:11,200
Someone broke into Pastorelli's salon

1134
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:13,200
and took his antique barber's pole

1135
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:15,200
The next morning Pastorelli

1136
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:17,200
touched some live wires that the thief left lying around

1137
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:19,200
and was electrocuted

1138
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:21,200
Well that darn foreigner got what he deserved

1139
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:23,200
if you ask me

1140
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:25,200
coming into a nice little town like harvest

1141
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:27,200
and stealing business

1142
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:29,200
Heavens if a bow and scissors

1143
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:31,200
were good enough for your father

1144
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:33,200
I don't see why decent working folk

1145
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:35,200
need a fancy wop styling their hair

1146
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:37,200
That's how it goes

1147
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:39,200
First you get a sissy trim then bang

1148
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:41,200
You're a communist

1149
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:43,200
Isn't it exciting Steve?

1150
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:45,200
Five days and twelve hundred cookies later

1151
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:47,200
the bake sale is already here

1152
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:49,200
Where does the time fly?

1153
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:51,200
Those one thousand

1154
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:53,200
two hundred cookies

1155
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:55,200
Senpai

1156
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:57,200
Oh about twenty

1157
02:01:57,200 --> 02:01:59,200
the rest were stale

1158
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:01,200
but the effort wasn't wasted it's for a good cause

1159
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:03,200
Will you be at the school tonight?

1160
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:07,200
Wouldn't miss it

1161
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:09,200
That's nice dear

1162
02:02:09,200 --> 02:02:11,200
It's good to be open to new experiences

1163
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:13,200
Oh my gosh

1164
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:19,200
No wonder your hair is terrible ma'am

1165
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:23,200
That was definitely

1166
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:25,200
a Facebook mom type of comment

1167
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:27,200
Yeah

1168
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:29,200
Oh my gosh

1169
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:31,200
I would just like to tell

1170
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:33,200
everyone I do not

1171
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:35,200
believe and

1172
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:37,200
reflect on this opinion

1173
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:41,200
Anyways thank you for the super chat

1174
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:43,200

1176
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:47,200
has kidnapped me and stolen my heart

1177
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:49,200
There it rhymes

1178
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:51,200
Yep that one rhymes good job good pat

1179
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:53,200
Good good job

1180
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:55,200
Good job

1181
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:01,200
It's good to be

1182
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:03,200
open to new experiences

1183
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:05,200
at the conservative wife

1184
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:07,200
Yeah

1185
02:03:07,200 --> 02:03:09,200
And disclaimer this game

1186
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:11,200
was made a long time ago

1187
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:13,200
and it was

1188
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:15,200
a protest

1189
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:17,200
against censorship

1190
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:19,200
So therefore there is going to be some things

1191
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:21,200
that are very you know

1192
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:23,200
controversial

1193
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:25,200
But

1194
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:27,200
please know that I do not reflect

1195
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:29,200
the opinions in these games

1196
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:33,200
What's the good cause

1197
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:55,200
The air

1198
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:03,200

of cookies like an automaton

1246
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:05,200
getting rid of its surplus product

1247
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:07,200
My so called mother has been baking

1248
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:09,200
cookies all week and then

1249
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:11,200
throwing them out better that

1250
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:13,200
than getting rid of us

1251
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:15,200
Wait around long enough

1252
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:17,200
I have a feeling they'll get to it

1253
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:21,200
I don't know if you heard or not

1254
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:23,200
but Mr. Pastor Ali the barber

1255
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:25,200
He's dead

1256
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:27,200
Looks like somebody stole

1257
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:29,200
a barber's pole from him

1258
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:31,200
Then left the exposed electrical wires

1259
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:33,200
and some water on the floor

1260
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:35,200
Pastor Ali walked in flipped on the lights

1261
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:37,200
and

1262
02:07:37,200 --> 02:07:39,200
No anything about that

1263
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:41,200
No

1264
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:45,200
Okay fine I didn't mean to kill him

1265
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:47,200
I just wanted the pole for the initiation

1266
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:49,200
Fuck it, fuck it we did this

1267
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:51,200
That was our bed

1268
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:55,200
Like a man died

1269
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:57,200
I didn't know

1270
02:07:57,200 --> 02:07:59,200
I forgot about the live wires

1271
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:01,200
and the water

1272
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:03,200
That doesn't change the fact that you killed him

1273
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:05,200
This initiation killed him

1274
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:07,200
It was just an accident

1275
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:11,200
It was just like some time

1276
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:13,200
where I

1277
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:15,200
Don't you see

1278
02:08:15,200 --> 02:08:17,200
I'm beginning to think that the lodge

1279
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:19,200
poisons everything it touches

1280
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:21,200
Harvest

1281
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:23,200
I didn't create this situation

1282
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:25,200
Are you sure

1283
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:27,200
No

1284
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:29,200
But however it started

1285
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:31,200
I'm gonna see it through to the end

1286
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:33,200
Vandalism theft

1287
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:35,200
Manslaughter

1288
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:37,200
What's next Steve, murder

1289
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:39,200
Second

1290
02:08:39,200 --> 02:08:41,200
I know in the beginning I suggested you might check out the lodge

1291
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:43,200
I was more worried about getting out of here

1292
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:45,200
than anything else

1293
02:08:45,200 --> 02:08:47,200
But now that I know you

1294
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:49,200
I'm worried about you too

1295
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:51,200
I'm fine

1296
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:57,200
I'm not fine

1297
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:21,200
Come back and visit me soon

1298
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:23,200
You can't just ask that after

1299
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:25,200
After doing that to me

1300
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:27,200
You can't just ask that

1301
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:29,200
I know I understand

1302
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:31,200
Sometimes sometimes

1303
02:09:31,200 --> 02:09:33,200
You know

1304
02:09:33,200 --> 02:09:35,200
Sometimes sometimes just force my hand sometimes

1305
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:37,200
And then I just have to

1306
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:39,200
I just have to

1307
02:09:41,200 --> 02:09:43,200
Yeah

1308
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:45,200
I know it happens to the best of us

1309
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:47,200
I didn't mean it though

1310
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:51,200
I didn't mean it

1311
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:53,200
Sometimes Senpai just walks into my knife

1312
02:09:53,200 --> 02:09:55,200
And my scissors

1313
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:57,200
And my bat

1314
02:09:57,200 --> 02:09:59,200
And my

1315
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:01,200
And the barrel

1316
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:03,200
The bone saw was me though

1317
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:05,200
But yeah

1318
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:07,200
You sometimes just walk into all of them

1319
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:15,200
And here it is

1320
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:17,200
The object dog

1321
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:19,200
The guard

1322
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:21,200
Imported Phoenician glass

1323
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:23,200
And Italian dreams

1324
02:10:23,200 --> 02:10:25,200
Italian dreams

1325
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:27,200
An unfortunate side effect

1326
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:29,200
That pastorelli was

1327
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:31,200
electrocuted because

1328
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:33,200
You left live wires

1329
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:35,200
In a puddle

1330
02:10:35,200 --> 02:10:37,200
I didn't know there was a puddle

1331
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:39,200
The stations of worldliness say

1332
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:41,200
Say love you

1333
02:10:47,200 --> 02:10:49,200
Oh you can say it man it was electrocuted

1334
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:51,200
Pastorelli's own incompetence

1335
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:53,200
Caused his unfortunate

1336
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:55,200
Accent

1337
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:57,200
Maybe his incompetence

1338
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:59,200
I had

1339
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:01,200
You left live electrical wires

1340
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:03,200
Hanging in the water

1341
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:05,200
On the floor

1342
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:07,200
Cross wired the alarm system

1343
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:09,200
To the sprinklers

1344
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:11,200
He'd be live today

1345
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:13,200
Of course

1346
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:15,200
You only wanted the pole

1347
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:17,200
But that hardly matters now

1348
02:11:17,200 --> 02:11:19,200
But he turned on the light

1349
02:11:25,200 --> 02:11:27,200
What?

1350
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:31,200
What?

1351
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:33,200
What?

1352
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:35,200
What do we have to do?

1353
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:37,200
No not the nice lady

1354
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:39,200
And her daughter's diner

1355
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:43,200
Not the diner everybody eats

1356
02:11:43,200 --> 02:11:45,200
There

1357
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:47,200
Not the French

1358
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:49,200
They're not French

1359
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:51,200
Are they?

1360
02:11:53,200 --> 02:11:55,200
They're not French are they?

1361
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:57,200
Oh no oh no

1362
02:11:57,200 --> 02:11:59,200
Does that mean we have to fry

1363
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:01,200
That means French

1364
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:03,200
French Canadian

1365
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:07,200
Oui oui

1366
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:09,200
Ah sacre ble

1367
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:15,200
And

1368
02:12:17,200 --> 02:12:19,200
Ah sacre ble

1369
02:12:19,200 --> 02:12:21,200
Ah

1370
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:29,200
Ah whatever

1371
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:31,200
That's no minor prank

1372
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:33,200
So close

1373
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:35,200
And yet so far

1374
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:37,200
What a pity

1375
02:12:37,200 --> 02:12:39,200
Tonight

1376
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:41,200
The big sale

1377
02:12:41,200 --> 02:12:43,200
What do you mean docks

1378
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:45,200
That was on her debut

1379
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:51,200
When sacrifice will be

1380
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:53,200
The order of the day

1381
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:55,200
What?

1382
02:12:59,200 --> 02:13:01,200
What?

1383
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:03,200
Okay repeat this

1384
02:13:05,200 --> 02:13:07,200
Okay pastor only took a big spill

1385
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:09,200
A permanent one

1386
02:13:19,200 --> 02:13:21,200
Alright any suggestions?

1387
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:41,200
So

1388
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:43,200
You know

1389
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:45,200
He just went

1390
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:47,200
Okay I gotta move the window

1391
02:13:47,200 --> 02:13:49,200
Up a little bit I can't get out of here

1392
02:13:49,200 --> 02:13:51,200
Without it moved

1393
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:53,200
There it is

1394
02:13:57,200 --> 02:13:59,200
Um

1395
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:07,200
I have to set fire

1396
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:09,200
To that nice ladies

1397
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:11,200
Diner

1398
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:13,200
Bye bye

1399
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:15,200
I can't talk now

1400
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:17,200
The dishes are stacked up in back

1401
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:19,200
And I better take advantage of the lull

1402
02:14:19,200 --> 02:14:21,200
I've whipped up a huge batch of brownies

1403
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:23,200
For the PTA bake sale tonight

1404
02:14:23,200 --> 02:14:25,200
I just wish I could do more

1405
02:14:25,200 --> 02:14:27,200
To help out those poor bums

1406
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:31,200
How will this sale help bums?

1407
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:33,200
Most of the bums that die in harvest

1408
02:14:33,200 --> 02:14:35,200
Lack the money for a good Christian burial

1409
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:37,200
The proceeds from this sale

1410
02:14:37,200 --> 02:14:39,200
Will help Mr Moynihan provide them

1411
02:14:39,200 --> 02:14:41,200
With proper burial services

1412
02:14:41,200 --> 02:14:43,200
Doesn't it strike you as funny

1413
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:45,200
That so many wanderers die in harvest?

1414
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:47,200
No

1415
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:49,200
Strikes me as sad

1416
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:51,200
You have an odd sense of humor Steve

1417
02:14:51,200 --> 02:14:53,200
Mr. Pastorelli was electrocuted

1418
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:55,200
He's dead

1419
02:14:55,200 --> 02:14:57,200
It looks like some thief wanted

1420
02:14:57,200 --> 02:14:59,200
His barber's pole but didn't think of the consequences

1421
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:01,200
Yeah

1422
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:03,200
That's what the guy had to do

1423
02:15:03,200 --> 02:15:05,200
Maybe whoever it was really needed

1424
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:07,200
That barber's pole bad

1425
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:09,200
There's no excuse for hurting someone else

1426
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:11,200
Even if Pastorelli were alive

1427
02:15:11,200 --> 02:15:13,200
Now his heart would be broken

1428
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:15,200
And what's a little profit compared to that?

1429
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:19,200
The most normal

1430
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:21,200
These are the

1431
02:15:21,200 --> 02:15:23,200
These characters

1432
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:25,200
Are the sense of

1433
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:27,200
Is the moral reasoning

1434
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:29,200
And I have to burn down

1435
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:31,200
Their

1436
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:33,200
Their precious home

1437
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:35,200
I mean like this was her

1438
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:37,200
Her memento from her

1439
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:39,200
From the husband that went away

1440
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:49,200
Ugh

1441
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:51,200
I feel bad

1442
02:15:51,200 --> 02:15:53,200
But I'm not gonna stop

1443
02:15:55,200 --> 02:15:57,200
I'm not gonna stop

1444
02:15:57,200 --> 02:15:59,200
Ugh

1445
02:16:03,200 --> 02:16:05,200
I feel bad

1446
02:16:05,200 --> 02:16:07,200
I feel like really bad

1447
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:09,200
But I'm not gonna stop

1448
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:11,200
Ugh

1449
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:21,200
Okay

1450
02:16:21,200 --> 02:16:23,200
Hello?

1451
02:16:23,200 --> 02:16:25,200
Yes

1452
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:27,200
I did it

1453
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:35,200
Got him! Yeah!

1454
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:37,200
We did it!

1455
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:41,200
Woohoo!

1456
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:43,200
You're busted!

1457
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:49,200
What will people think?

1458
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:53,200
Yeah

1459
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:57,200
He's a smiley bear

1460
02:16:57,200 --> 02:16:59,200
But we should give him a token of our

1461
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:01,200
Appreciation for his silence

1462
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:03,200
Here Stephen, take this baseball bat

1463
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:05,200
You'll find it quite useful

1464
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:09,200
Alright

1465
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:11,200
Maybe I could use a good solid bat

1466
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:13,200
Yeah boy

1467
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:15,200
Take the bat

1468
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:17,200
And we'll take the photo

1469
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:19,200
However will I keep the children in line now

1470
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:21,200
I have a spare I can bring in tomorrow

1471
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:23,200
Unless you prefer a chainsaw this time

1472
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:25,200
I'll talk to Mrs. Phelps

1473
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:29,200
Can I do it again?

1474
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:33,200
Okay

1475
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:35,200
Well that didn't work

1476
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:39,200
A chainsaw?

1477
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:41,200
Oh strongy!

1478
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:45,200
I feel so terrible

1479
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:47,200
That's okay

1480
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:49,200
Start using the bat

1481
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:51,200
On what?

1482
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:55,200
Okay

1483
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:19,200

Welcome Raiders

1487

Welcome to the stream

1488
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:29,200
Welcome to the stream

02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:31,200
Hello hello hello

Daughters

1493
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:39,200
Daughters

1494
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:41,200
You don't say the t's when you're

1495
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:43,200
In squats

1496
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:45,200
And today

1497
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:47,200
I am committing crimes

1498
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:49,200
Not real crimes

1499
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:51,200
Game crimes

1500
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:53,200
We are currently playing

1501
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:55,200
Harvester

1502
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:57,200
It's a game from

1503
02:18:57,200 --> 02:18:59,200
Senpai

1504
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:01,200
When was this game made?

1505
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:03,200
Anyways

1506
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:09,200
Anyways

1507
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:11,200
It was a

1508
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:13,200
Oh

1509
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:15,200
It was a

1510
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:19,200
Controversial game

1511
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:25,200
1998

1512
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:27,200
1996

1513
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:29,200
1996 yeah yeah yeah yeah

1514
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:31,200
It's a pretty old game

1515
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:39,200
My breasts huh

1516
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:43,200
Hope to see you at the back sale tonight

1517
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:45,200
When I went to get my hair trimmed this morning

1518
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:47,200
Imagine my surprise

1519
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:49,200
When I learned that the barbershop

1520
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:51,200
Had been burglarized

1521
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:53,200
And worse that Mr.

1522
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:55,200
Pastor really had been electrocuted

1523
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:57,200
Harvest mourns the loss

1524
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:59,200
Of an irreplaceable citizen

1525
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:01,200
All of us will feel the loss

1526
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:03,200
Only with the passage of time

1527
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:09,200
Drop in again soon

1528
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:11,200
If you weren't

1529
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:13,200
If you weren't

1530
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:15,200
If you weren't a diddler

1531
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:17,200
If you weren't a diddler

1532
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:19,200
Senpai

1533
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:21,200
Senpai

1534
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:23,200
Thank you so much secret for a gifting

1535
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:25,200
A memba

1536
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:27,200
If you weren't

1537
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:29,200
If you weren't a diddler

1538
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:31,200
That would have been some like

1539
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:33,200
Okay thing to say you know

1540
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:35,200
You know

1541
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:39,200
Well now I have a bat

1542
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:53,200

Yes of course

1544
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:01,200
Well that kid's gone

1545
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:05,200
But

1546
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:07,200
We don't practice

1547
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:09,200
That bridge is the

1548
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:11,200
Oh dear

1549
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:13,200
Wait I thought she gave me her bat

1550
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:15,200
Now she has a bat again

1551
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:21,200
Okay bye

1552
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:23,200
Bye

1553
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:25,200
So how do I use this

1554
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:27,200
Do I just go

1555
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:29,200
Can I kill him

1556
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:31,200
Can I kill him

1557
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:41,200
Bye

1558
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:43,200
I didn't save

1559
02:21:47,200 --> 02:21:49,200
I didn't save

1560
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:55,200
I didn't save

1561
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:57,200
I was the last time I saved

1562
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:01,200
In cold blood I can

1563
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:03,200
Well you know

1564
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:07,200
It's fine

1565
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:19,200

1566
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:21,200
This is nip

1567
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:27,200
Too late for that boy

1568
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:29,200
Ain't it sergeant

1569
02:22:29,200 --> 02:22:31,200
Indeed it is

1570
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:33,200
Sheriff

1571
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:35,200
Answers may only be found

1572
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:37,200
In the lodge

1573
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:39,200
And you must be alive

1574
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:41,200
To see them

1575
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:43,200
Oh

1576
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:45,200
Oh okay

1577
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:47,200
Bye

1578
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:49,200
Bye me

02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:51,200
Oh

1580
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:57,200
Well that was my bad

1581
02:22:57,200 --> 02:22:59,200
Let's not do that again

1582
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:01,200
My bad

1583
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:03,200
Load game

1584
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:09,200
Well when did I

1585
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:13,200
When did I

1586
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:15,200
When did I save

1587
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:17,200
All the way back here we're fine

1588
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:19,200
I need my paper

1589
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:21,200
Okay

1590
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:23,200
Blah blah blah bye

1591
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:29,200
Mom

1592
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:31,200
Yeah yeah yeah

1593
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:37,200
I have some things to do

1594
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:41,200
What is the good cause

1595
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:49,200
Hey goodbye

1596
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:51,200
Don't forget to put

1597
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:53,200
There we go we're kinda back

1598
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:55,200
It's not too bad it's just the start of the day

1599
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:01,200
And then we go here

1600
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:03,200
And then we open our inventory

1601
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:05,200
And then we give

1602
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:07,200
See how easy it is

1603
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:09,200
Things are so much better between us

1604
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:11,200
When you remember the paper in the morning

1605
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:13,200
Let's keep them that way

1606
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:15,200
Have you tried flirting with mommy yet?

1607
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:17,200
Yep I did

1608
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:19,200
And then

1609
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:21,200
I was like so is anything gonna happen

1610
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:23,200
And then nothing happened so now I'm sad

1611
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:25,200
That nothing happened but at the same time

1612
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:27,200
A little relieved you know

1613
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:31,200
I can't believe that if I break into a place

1614
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:33,200
Then

1615
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:35,200
Then I get a kiss on the forehead

1616
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:37,200
And a tucked in good night

1617
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:39,200
And like a death sentence for attacking someone

1618
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:45,200
I can't believe it

1619
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:47,200
I'm just like okay

1620
02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:55,200
Well

1621
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:57,200
Go back to the Potsdam's residence

1622
02:24:57,200 --> 02:24:59,200
That was my bad

1623
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:01,200
Is this a visual novel? No

1624
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:03,200
It's a point

1625
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:05,200
Look at us we're pointing

1626
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:07,200
And we're clicking

1627
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:19,200
There it is

1628
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:23,200
Bye bye

1629
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:25,200
I hate this man's

1630
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:27,200
Hello dear

1631
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:29,200
Yeah

1632
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:31,200
She's upstairs

1633
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:33,200
The bake sale is to

1634
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:35,200
Okay bye bake sales tonight

1635
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:37,200
Okay got it

1636
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:39,200
Yeah

1637
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:41,200
Yeah I pointed and clicked too hard

1638
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:45,200
Okay we're going in here

1639
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:47,200
Maybe Stephanie knows what to do with the tampons

1640
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:49,200
I remember it says maybe Stephanie knows what to do with the tampons

1641
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:51,200
Tampons

1642
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:53,200
Are you making some kind of point?

1643
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:55,200
No

1644
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:57,200
I'm fine

1645
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:09,200
Yep

1646
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:19,200
I didn't mean to kill him my bad

1647
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:27,200
I'm fine

1648
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:33,200
Bye sorry

1649
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:35,200
I'm skipping through the text because we already got it

1650
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:47,200
Don't forget to save this time yes

1651
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:49,200
Gotta save

1652
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:51,200
Save

1653
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:53,200
Where's the second disc

1654
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:57,200
Yeah we gotta get

1655
02:26:57,200 --> 02:26:59,200
A bat

1656
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:01,200
Oh yeah and we gotta go to the lodge

1657
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:03,200
Hi

1658
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:05,200
Yeah you're imported glass

1659
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:07,200
Blah blah blah blah

1660
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:13,200
That's no minor

1661
02:27:13,200 --> 02:27:15,200
Prank

1662
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:19,200
Okay

1663
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:21,200
I guess I have to do it

1664
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:23,200
The game will be over

1665
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:27,200
I think I went to

1666
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:29,200
Edna's diner

1667
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:31,200
And she's like the voice of reason in this game

1668
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:43,200
Hi Mr. Bake Sale

1669
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:45,200
Mr. Pastorelli was electrocuted

1670
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:47,200
He's dead

1671
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:49,200
It looks like some thief wanted his

1672
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:51,200
Barbers pole but didn't think of the consequences

1673
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:53,200
Could you hit the lodge guy with the bat?

1674
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:55,200
Maybe whoever it was really needed that

1675
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:57,200
Barbers pole bat

1676
02:27:57,200 --> 02:27:59,200
That's no excuse for hurting someone else

1677
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:01,200
Even if Pastorelli were alive now

1678
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:03,200
His heart would be broken

1679
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:05,200
We'll consider that

1680
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:07,200
We'll consider that

1681
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:09,200
Hi

1682
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:11,200
We'll consider that

1683
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:15,200
Or the sheriff

1684
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:17,200
We'll consider those possibilities

1685
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:19,200
Soon

1686
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:21,200
Now

1687
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:23,200
We can go spy on them

1688
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:25,200
Hihi

1689
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:27,200
Use the key

1690
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:29,200
Oh man

1691
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:31,200
Okay

1692
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:33,200
We got it

1693
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:35,200
Can I save?

1694
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:37,200
Yeah

1695
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:39,200
We'll save here

1696
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:41,200
And then

1697
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:43,200
Say cheese

1698
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:49,200
Yeah

1699
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:51,200
Blasted

1700
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:57,200
What will people think?

1701
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:01,200
Yeah

1702
02:29:11,200 --> 02:29:13,200
You'll find it quite useful

1703
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:17,200
Should we

1704
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:19,200
I wonder if it's like

1705
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:21,200
I think the photo is worth more than that

1706
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:23,200
Should we do that? Should we do like

1707
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:25,200
There's more than that

1708
02:29:25,200 --> 02:29:27,200
Let's just see

1709
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:35,200
I'll take the fricking bat

1710
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:43,200
Whatever I'll take the bat

1711
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:45,200
See ya

1712
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:47,200
It's so true though

1713
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:49,200
It's so true they're educators

1714
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:51,200
They got no money

1715
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:53,200
She's gonna bat you

1716
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:55,200
I mean like

1717
02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:57,200
Apparently she already did

1718
02:29:57,200 --> 02:29:59,200
In her youth

1719
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:01,200
I mean in my youth

1720
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:03,200
Can I get some more meat?

1721
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:05,200
My meat permission slip

1722
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:13,200
Give me the meat

1723
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:15,200
Yeah extra meat baby

1724
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:21,200
Teachers don't get paid enough

1725
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:23,200
You survived getting the bat?

1726
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:25,200
Yeah

1727
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:33,200
I'm gonna visit the barber shop

1728
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:35,200
And cry a little

1729
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:43,200
Oh no

1730
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:47,200
That for the occasion I

1731
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:54,200
Think about taking some of that sighting off my hand son

1732
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:56,200
It's sad to see

1733
02:30:56,200 --> 02:30:58,200
To see that you know it's just a chart

1734
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:13,200
The beef was well done too

1735
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:18,200
Problem is both was burnt so bad

1736
02:31:18,200 --> 02:31:20,200
And the flesh all crisp

1737
02:31:20,200 --> 02:31:22,200
And distorted limbs melded

1738
02:31:22,200 --> 02:31:24,200
You couldn't tell them apart

1739
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:28,200
And well I didn't want to take a chance

1740
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:30,200
On eating Italian

1741
02:31:30,200 --> 02:31:32,200
No sir I didn't

1742
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:34,200
You didn't want it? You were gonna eat him?

1743
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:36,200
Nice to see you again Steve

1744
02:31:36,200 --> 02:31:38,200
You're gonna eat him?

1745
02:31:38,200 --> 02:31:40,200
I can't talk now son

1746
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:43,200
I guess you heard

1747
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:45,200
That dang edged pastorelli

1748
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:47,200
Went out and got his self-electric cheated

1749
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:50,200
Somebody stole the barber's pole

1750
02:31:50,200 --> 02:31:52,200
The alarm system triggered the sprinkler

1751
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:55,200
There was water on the floor this morning

1752
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:58,200
And the derm crook left exposed wires out

1753
02:31:58,200 --> 02:32:00,200
The pastorelli came in

1754
02:32:00,200 --> 02:32:02,200
Flipped the switch and then

1755
02:32:02,200 --> 02:32:04,200
ZAP

1756
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:07,200
Maybe them aliens is hot for colored glass after all

1757
02:32:08,200 --> 02:32:11,200
Any time Steve

1758
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:13,200
Not gonna lie

1759
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:15,200
I'm a little sad

1760
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:17,200
I'm a little sad

1761
02:32:18,200 --> 02:32:20,200
Pastorelli

1762
02:32:20,200 --> 02:32:22,200
He didn't talk much

1763
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:24,200
But he was there

1764
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:28,200
Okay now I gotta figure out how to burn that damn building now

1765
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:30,200
Sorry son

1766
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:34,200
I hear you've been spreading all sorts of gossip about me around town

1767
02:32:34,200 --> 02:32:35,200
Did I?

1768
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:37,200
That was a lot

1769
02:33:00,200 --> 02:33:02,200
A hot town huh?

1770
02:33:02,200 --> 02:33:04,200
Don't forget this

1771
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:07,200
I don't think I told anyone about you by the way

1772
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:12,200
That was some whiplash for sure

1773
02:33:14,200 --> 02:33:16,200
Mood switch crazy

1774
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:19,200
Sometimes my mood switch gets like that too

1775
02:33:19,200 --> 02:33:22,200
You still love me though right Senpai?

1776
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:28,200
Was this game developed by Swarri?

1777
02:33:28,200 --> 02:33:30,200
I don't know

1778
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:35,200
Hello Steve

1779
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:38,200
Those PTA busybodies have hurt my business

1780
02:33:38,200 --> 02:33:40,200
Something terrible this week

1781
02:33:40,200 --> 02:33:42,200
Nobody's buying my cookies

1782
02:33:42,200 --> 02:33:46,200
They're all saving up for the big bake sale

1783
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:49,200
Somebody stole the barber's pole from that nice Italian

1784
02:33:49,200 --> 02:33:51,200
Italian

1785
02:33:51,200 --> 02:33:53,200
Can you imagine?

1786
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:57,200
And then they left wife wires dangling in a puddle

1787
02:33:57,200 --> 02:34:00,200
Which Pastorelli immediately stepped in and fried

1788
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:02,200
The stupid dago

1789
02:34:02,200 --> 02:34:05,200
Heavens to Betsy when it rains it pours

1790
02:34:06,200 --> 02:34:08,200
My bad

1791
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:12,200
Once again

1792
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:14,200
What can I say other than

1793
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:17,200
My bad

1794
02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:33,200
Tee hee

1795
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:47,200
Hello

1796
02:34:48,200 --> 02:34:50,200
I feel sad

1797
02:34:50,200 --> 02:34:52,200
I feel like I'm responsible for my actions

1798
02:34:52,200 --> 02:34:54,200
But I'm still gonna do it

1799
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:56,200
Give me a glue

1800
02:35:00,200 --> 02:35:02,200
I'm afraid that's not good enough

1801
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:04,200
What do you want?

1802
02:35:04,200 --> 02:35:06,200
You want some meat?

1803
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:12,200
What do I show on the hotel ledger?

1804
02:35:12,200 --> 02:35:14,200
Why should I

1805
02:35:20,200 --> 02:35:22,200
You want some meat?

1806
02:35:26,200 --> 02:35:28,200
Why should I care about that?

1807
02:35:28,200 --> 02:35:30,200
That's your favorite thing

1808
02:35:30,200 --> 02:35:31,200
Meat

1809
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:33,200
Why doesn't he care about the meat?

1810
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:35,200
You want an autograph?

1811
02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:40,200
I don't know man I want a blackmail this guy

1812
02:35:42,200 --> 02:35:44,200
Oh blackmail this guy

1813
02:35:44,200 --> 02:35:46,200
Oh my gosh

1814
02:35:46,200 --> 02:35:48,200
Oh my god thank you for the

1815
02:35:48,200 --> 02:35:50,200
For the memba

Come on can I take the headstone?

1823
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:16,200
What if I

1824
02:36:16,200 --> 02:36:18,200
No not the note maybe if I use the

1825
02:36:20,200 --> 02:36:22,200
Hotel ledger

1826
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:26,200
How do I blackmail this man?

1827
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:30,200
Can we give the meat to your father-in-law?

1828
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:32,200
Oh yeah I could do that

1829
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:34,200
Let's go see

1830
02:36:34,200 --> 02:36:36,200
If I can get some meat

1831
02:36:40,200 --> 02:36:42,200
That didn't work

1832
02:36:42,200 --> 02:36:44,200
It's not as bad as some

1833
02:36:44,200 --> 02:36:46,200
Point and clicks for example

1834
02:36:46,200 --> 02:36:48,200
And um

1835
02:36:48,200 --> 02:36:50,200
Sherlock Holmes

1836
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:52,200
Um

1837
02:36:52,200 --> 02:36:54,200
No that can't be used for anything

1838
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:56,200
No that can't be used for any

1839
02:36:56,200 --> 02:36:58,200
Can't be used for anything

1840
02:36:58,200 --> 02:37:00,200
Or use the ballonin

1841
02:37:00,200 --> 02:37:02,200
I have too many witnesses

1842
02:37:04,200 --> 02:37:06,200
You want meat?

1843
02:37:06,200 --> 02:37:08,200
Say that's

1844
02:37:08,200 --> 02:37:10,200
That's a nice cut there Steve

1845
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:12,200
Did you bring it for me?

1846
02:37:16,200 --> 02:37:18,200
Sure

1847
02:37:18,200 --> 02:37:20,200
Sure you can have it

1848
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:28,200
I'm gonna go get some meat again

1849
02:37:32,200 --> 02:37:34,200
This freak I know right

1850
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:36,200
Why he just cares about the meat so much

1851
02:37:36,200 --> 02:37:38,200
Anyway I'm gonna go get some more meat

1852
02:37:40,200 --> 02:37:42,200
You literally can just give it to him

1853
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:44,200
Okay that's interesting

1854
02:37:46,200 --> 02:37:48,200
Okay

1855
02:37:50,200 --> 02:37:52,200

No not the meat

1885
02:39:24,200 --> 02:39:26,200
We can't get any more meat

1886
02:39:26,200 --> 02:39:28,200
That sucks

1887
02:39:28,200 --> 02:39:30,200
Okay well

1888
02:39:30,200 --> 02:39:32,200

02:39:44,200 --> 02:39:46,200
The door it's locked

1892
02:39:48,200 --> 02:39:50,200
Young man we really

1893
02:39:50,200 --> 02:39:52,200
I do hope you'll attend the bakes

1894
02:39:52,200 --> 02:39:54,200
Sure

1895
02:39:54,200 --> 02:39:56,200
Ditch makes a poor resting place

1896
02:39:56,200 --> 02:39:58,200
You make it sound like I have

1897
02:39:58,200 --> 02:40:00,200
A choice that is rapidly vanished

1898
02:40:02,200 --> 02:40:04,200
Murder

1899
02:40:04,200 --> 02:40:06,200
Murder

1900
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:08,200
I can't spell murder

1901
02:40:08,200 --> 02:40:10,200
Murderer

1902
02:40:12,200 --> 02:40:14,200
Oh shit

1903
02:40:16,200 --> 02:40:18,200
Okay bye

1904
02:40:22,200 --> 02:40:24,200
Where is he

1905
02:40:24,200 --> 02:40:26,200
No more meat

1906
02:40:26,200 --> 02:40:28,200
Murderer

1907
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:30,200
Fire station

1908
02:40:32,200 --> 02:40:34,200
Are they still fighting

1909
02:40:36,200 --> 02:40:38,200
Well it's quiet now

1910
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:42,200
Maybe they all killed each other

1911
02:40:42,200 --> 02:40:44,200
Unfortunately

1912
02:40:48,200 --> 02:40:50,200
Kettle

1913
02:40:58,200 --> 02:41:00,200
Looks like we've got us a many

1914
02:41:00,200 --> 02:41:02,200
Crime wave on our hands

1915
02:41:02,200 --> 02:41:04,200
Just got a report about another

1916
02:41:04,200 --> 02:41:06,200
Act of vandalism

1917
02:41:06,200 --> 02:41:08,200
Maybe related to the tucker

1918
02:41:08,200 --> 02:41:10,200
And the fire station robbery

1919
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:12,200
Someone broke into pastorelli's

1920
02:41:12,200 --> 02:41:14,200
Barbershop and took his pole

1921
02:41:14,200 --> 02:41:16,200
Next morning pastorelli touched

1922
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:18,200
Some live electrical wires that were

1923
02:41:18,200 --> 02:41:20,200
Left dangling and zap

1924
02:41:20,200 --> 02:41:22,200
No more barber

1925
02:41:22,200 --> 02:41:24,200
What was just an act of vandalism

1926
02:41:24,200 --> 02:41:26,200
Has just become a case of manslaughter

1927
02:41:26,200 --> 02:41:28,200
Harvest used to be such a nice

1928
02:41:28,200 --> 02:41:30,200
Little town

1929
02:41:30,200 --> 02:41:32,200
Yeah

1930
02:41:32,200 --> 02:41:34,200
Stop on by any time Steve

1931
02:41:34,200 --> 02:41:36,200
Let me check

1932
02:41:36,200 --> 02:41:38,200
I don't think I still have it

1933
02:41:38,200 --> 02:41:40,200
Notes

1934
02:41:40,200 --> 02:41:42,200
Sheriff's checkbook

1935
02:41:42,200 --> 02:41:44,200
Fire

1936
02:41:48,200 --> 02:41:50,200

No I got the hotel ledger

1938
02:41:54,200 --> 02:41:56,200

1939
02:41:56,200 --> 02:41:58,200
Man

1940
02:41:58,200 --> 02:42:00,200
That's not pertinent to any investigations

1941
02:42:08,200 --> 02:42:10,200
Why does everyone think I'm talking about them

1942
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:12,200
I didn't do nothing

1943
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:14,200
A button

1944
02:42:16,200 --> 02:42:18,200
I only showed the button to

1945
02:42:18,200 --> 02:42:20,200
Oh wait

1946
02:42:20,200 --> 02:42:22,200
I showed it to the lost woman

1947
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:24,200
Aw man she snitched on me

1948
02:42:28,200 --> 02:42:30,200
Did she snitch on me

1949
02:42:30,200 --> 02:42:32,200

Snitch on me

1953
02:42:40,200 --> 02:42:42,200

It's just a tragedy

1967
02:43:08,200 --> 02:43:10,200
Of course

1968
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:12,200
Pastorelli got electricuted

1970
02:43:14,200 --> 02:43:16,200
Okay

1986
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:19,000
weapon this whole time I didn't realize I did strange how there's a correlation

1987
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:24,480
between the bums who've died and the bums you've put up at your hotel

1988

nominally engaging coincidence for personal gain yes what an immoral thing to do Stephen

2048
02:52:55,140 --> 02:53:00,340
I'm not the one up to my ass in dead bodies yes but you have an un-reasoning faith in the

2089
02:58:56,820 --> 02:58:57,780
look at this

2090
02:58:58,900 --> 02:59:05,700
ah you've taken up photography I see now why on earth would you choose such a grotesque subject

2091
02:59:05,700 --> 02:59:11,860
that John Doe you've got boxed up in the chapel he didn't just drop dead someone helped him take the

2092
02:59:11,860 --> 02:59:19,460
plunge hmm you may be right I'm a mortician not a medical examiner you don't have to be to know

2093
02:59:19,460 --> 02:59:24,340
that being ripped to shreds can be detrimental to your health this is not something you want to

2094
02:59:24,340 --> 02:59:30,100
be looking into young man

2095
02:59:33,380 --> 02:59:39,140
okay what should we say number one or number two some pie no shit I just want to find out who I

2096
02:59:39,140 --> 02:59:43,540
am get the hell out of here or is that a threat I've got the goods on you not vice versa

2097
02:59:48,340 --> 02:59:56,900
number one number one no shit that's what we all want what do you mean that's a game we win or

2098
02:59:56,900 --> 03:00:01,220
lose together wait what are you gonna tell me what I want to know or do I go to the sheriff

2099
03:00:01,220 --> 03:00:07,780
with these pictures that would be a grave mistake I assure you I've told you all I can

2100
03:00:08,740 --> 03:00:12,260
my losses have been substantial of late so I can't offer you money

2101
03:00:13,700 --> 03:00:20,660
the only thing I can give you an exchange for the photographs is my tube of astro glue I do

2102
03:00:20,660 --> 03:00:31,780
suggest you take it for it's all you'll get from me here we go should we just take the glue now

2103
03:00:32,020 --> 03:00:41,780
yeah we're just oh it's a trade or should I say not good enough I'm going to the sheriff

2104
03:00:42,580 --> 03:00:43,460
I'll probably die

2105
03:00:46,020 --> 03:00:54,980
fuck it I want to see be sure and tell actually I want the young man it seems like that corpse in

2106
03:00:54,980 --> 03:01:01,940
the chapel I'll dress up and nowhere to go god knows by putting these people up at the wayward

2107
03:01:01,940 --> 03:01:09,380
hotel I do orps the corpse reclining in the chapel right now is a prime example of the difficulties

2108
03:01:09,380 --> 03:01:15,460
I've just like oh that's where the hint came from he died a purely natural car but why come to harvest

2109
03:01:15,460 --> 03:01:22,260
to die I've often puzzled this was this was the hint oops though I can assure you young man that

2110
03:01:22,260 --> 03:01:28,340
nothing untoward is happening in harvest on the contrary it's an indication of our compassion

2111
03:01:28,340 --> 03:01:34,100
that I put up hobos in the wayward hotel and the order of the harvest moon mandates their prompt

2112
03:01:34,100 --> 03:01:40,660
burial even when they are without family or means and when it entails losses on my part

2113
03:01:41,780 --> 03:01:46,980
bye okay that was the hint say it's been a that was a hint he why didn't you tell me that before

2114
03:01:46,980 --> 03:01:53,540
anyways give me this again ah you that john hmm you don't this is

2115
03:01:55,540 --> 03:02:03,060
that's what we would get a look that would be I do suggest okay I'll take the glue wise decision

2116
03:02:04,020 --> 03:02:11,380
when a wasp's nest is stirred up it is seldom the wasps who grieve later thanks for the glue get

2117
03:02:11,380 --> 03:02:18,420
out of here I got a little things at our order but we got there we got the glue

2118
03:02:23,540 --> 03:02:32,020
now what do I do with the glue I wanted it so badly I wanted it so badly but now I'm just like well

2119
03:02:32,020 --> 03:02:39,060
what do I do with it wasp like the wasp lady yeah

2120
03:02:39,060 --> 03:02:48,100
yeah

2121
03:02:53,060 --> 03:02:59,300
I really wanted to oh wait I can't talk okay bye

2123
03:03:16,580 --> 03:03:17,380

seeing you here again what my breast just swells with when I went to get my head and worse

2128
03:03:51,620 --> 03:03:54,660
drop in again

2129
03:04:00,260 --> 03:04:02,660
adult quality time

2130
03:04:12,500 --> 03:04:15,940
see what we have our inventory we have the hotel ledger

2131
03:04:16,580 --> 03:04:19,380

2133
03:04:28,260 --> 03:04:34,740
what can we do about the burnt flyer if I show the burnt flyer to him

2134
03:04:36,820 --> 03:04:40,100
that interests me not at all young man okay

2135
03:04:46,420 --> 03:04:48,100
where do I go next

2136
03:04:53,060 --> 03:04:53,860
maybe back home

2137
03:05:02,740 --> 03:05:05,780
I don't want to sleep it's the baby hello

2138
03:05:06,980 --> 03:05:09,140
okay don't forget to put the pin

2139
03:05:10,820 --> 03:05:14,980
okay okay we gotta figure out how to burn that place down

2140
03:05:16,740 --> 03:05:21,460
let's talk to the wasp lady yeah he did say about the wasp nest right

2141
03:05:24,580 --> 03:05:25,780
what if I show her the glue

2142
03:05:28,420 --> 03:05:29,300
it's not often

2143
03:05:33,380 --> 03:05:36,500
you want you want some glue

2144
03:05:38,180 --> 03:05:40,420
I have okay never mind

2145
03:05:40,420 --> 03:05:44,820
um geez why do

2146
03:05:48,820 --> 03:05:49,860
I get fire

2147
03:05:53,860 --> 03:05:56,340
okay first off we need something as a fire starter

2148
03:05:56,740 --> 03:06:13,140
oh wait the but maybe you could use the glue on the people

2149
03:06:16,980 --> 03:06:21,540
that sounds logical and therefore it probably won't work but that does sound

2150
03:06:21,540 --> 03:06:25,460
logical and maybe we'll be in for a surprise let's go see

2151
03:06:30,980 --> 03:06:32,740
let's go see let's go see if we can do it

2152
03:06:37,220 --> 03:06:40,820
where's my astral glue okay well that didn't work

2153
03:06:43,140 --> 03:06:48,980
no did you have a gas can yeah I gave it back though

2154
03:06:51,620 --> 03:06:59,940
I uh I gave it back though I gave it back so that the other man can start arson

2155
03:07:00,660 --> 03:07:03,140
arson logic fails again

2156
03:07:06,420 --> 03:07:07,620
can I grab this can

2157
03:07:09,540 --> 03:07:13,780
give me it give me it oh I want it I want that can of gas

2158
03:07:21,540 --> 03:07:31,460
okay we need something for the fire maybe maybe gonna ask the post office man

2159
03:07:35,540 --> 03:07:39,860

2193
03:12:06,420 --> 03:12:08,100

2394
03:37:35,700 --> 03:37:44,260
watching tv don't hurt me mom but not watching tv hurts bad if I find out who burnt down the tv

2397
03:37:58,100 --> 03:38:03,300
Hank come on right mom how did the bake sale go

2398
03:38:04,980 --> 03:38:11,460
hello dear how are you today the nerve of some people burning down the tv station to detract from

2399
03:38:11,460 --> 03:38:18,660
our bake sale I doubt the perpetrator did it just to annoy the harvest pta coincidence I don't think

2400
03:38:18,660 --> 03:38:23,860
so just six months ago the newspaper building went up in smoke obviously there's a fire bug on the

2401
03:38:24,340 --> 03:38:29,380
either that or a communist communist huh I'm so scared

2402
03:38:32,500 --> 03:38:36,980
why are you so why are you scared now that the bake sales over I just don't know how I'll

2403
03:38:36,980 --> 03:38:45,780
fill my time oh I feel so useless what's wrong with her

2404
03:38:55,300 --> 03:39:00,820
oh it's not as bad as it looks you just pop them back in

2405
03:39:07,700 --> 03:39:14,980
see as good as new that tarantula she ate must have had wasp eggs in it

2406
03:39:14,980 --> 03:39:22,020
don't you think we should get her to a doctor what for she's got her mother how silly I was

2407
03:39:22,020 --> 03:39:28,420
feeling useless just because there are no more cookies to bake I can still rear my brood this is

2408
03:39:28,420 --> 03:39:36,580
a sign Steve I have a purpose again glad to see you're feeling better mine that fire still burns

2409
03:39:36,660 --> 03:39:44,820
my bridges first the newspaper building then DNA's diner then WHAR I sense a pattern and any

2410
03:39:44,820 --> 03:39:50,260
pattern I can't make a dress out of is no darn good I suppose you heard about DNA's diner burning

2411
03:39:50,260 --> 03:39:56,420
down sheriff Dwayne thinks it was a grease fire we took a black eye on the bake sale but I'm sure

2412
03:39:56,420 --> 03:40:02,580
the harvest pta annual blood drive will be more successful overall we made about 200 dollars

2413
03:40:02,580 --> 03:40:08,020
hardly enough to bury a dead horse and definitely not enough to cover the annual blood drive

2414
03:40:11,700 --> 03:40:12,500
the blood drive

2415
03:40:15,060 --> 03:40:23,380
oh is my sister okay annual blood drive huh if you knew how much blood we get you'd be more impressed

2416
03:40:24,420 --> 03:40:30,420
donations are mandatory Steve if you're still here come sunday you'll be expected to give

2417
03:40:30,900 --> 03:40:38,100
until it hurts I suppose until it hurts even Hank will have to donate of course lodge members

2418
03:40:38,100 --> 03:40:46,100
are exempt remember that hey either way no one's sticking me with the needle we don't use needles

2419
03:40:46,100 --> 03:40:53,860

2426
03:41:38,980 --> 03:41:40,420

2427
03:41:47,940 --> 03:41:50,100

2428
03:41:57,220 --> 03:42:03,060
did you say hello to your father for me yeah I did thank god harvest will never be the same

2429
03:42:03,140 --> 03:42:07,860
without DNA's diner without DNA for that matter what

2430
03:42:13,220 --> 03:42:19,700
I can't walk close to the kid why not go upstairs and talk to Stephanie she'd enjoy the company

2431
03:42:19,700 --> 03:42:26,020
and while you're upstairs feel free to vlog sorry Steve I'm too upset to talk right now

2432
03:42:26,980 --> 03:42:31,700
I can't believe anyone would burn down the tv station the night of the bake sale

2433
03:42:32,420 --> 03:42:38,020
I just hope nothing will stop the harvest blood drive and I don't think that anything can

2434
03:42:39,220 --> 03:42:46,340
I'm not one to gossip but I'm sure you've heard that DNA's diner burned down but did you know

2435
03:42:46,340 --> 03:42:53,380
she killed herself when she found out what her and her daughter too what I hear the sheriff suspects

2436
03:42:53,380 --> 03:43:00,180
the fire was set if you ask me whoever burned down the diner is a murderer just the same as

2437
03:43:00,180 --> 03:43:03,220
if he'd blown Edna's brains out personally

2438
03:43:12,500 --> 03:43:19,220
I feel so bad Edna the voice of reason

2439
03:43:19,220 --> 03:43:26,260

DNA's diner is no oh that hurts

2515
03:53:31,300 --> 03:53:32,500
I've always been such a kid her

2516
03:53:34,020 --> 03:53:39,220
as soon as she realized what had happened to her beloved establishment

2517
03:53:40,260 --> 03:53:44,260
a true entrepreneur and a credit to our nation

2518
03:53:44,980 --> 03:53:50,820
you bastards you made me a murderer

2519
03:53:51,780 --> 03:53:59,620
her suicide was an unforeseen by-product predictable by no one she killed herself

2520
03:54:00,500 --> 03:54:08,260
she made our choice if you were a catalyst join the rest of the world we all live

2521
03:54:08,260 --> 03:54:15,940
of the deaths of others still you sought to torture diner and to which

2522
03:54:27,220 --> 03:54:36,420
candidate I thought I was initiation this was only a trial to determine your worthiness for

2523
03:54:36,500 --> 03:54:44,420
testing your initiation into the mysteries of the harvest will soon begin what in the meantime

2524
03:54:45,300 --> 03:54:52,820
be patient protocols must be observed before initiation you think you got a

2525
03:54:52,820 --> 03:54:58,980
sore throw from that I think probably took a lot to break you will know when you receive the

2526
03:54:58,980 --> 03:55:04,180
invitation bring it here and your initiation shall begin

2527

03:55:23,060 --> 03:55:25,140
what is this two different things

2529
03:55:26,100 --> 03:55:28,980
still you sought to torture

2530
03:55:30,980 --> 03:55:38,580
regardless having completed the trials an invitation shall be forthcoming

2531
03:55:39,140 --> 03:55:46,100

2540
03:56:56,740 --> 03:57:02,340

2541
03:57:02,340 --> 03:57:09,380

2542
03:57:12,580 --> 03:57:15,940

okay scene

2546
03:57:40,260 --> 03:57:43,620
I've tried so hard to find an excuse to keep on fighting

2547
03:57:44,580 --> 03:57:50,900
I care and I can't go on alone any longer this diner he loved us was all we had

2548
03:57:51,860 --> 03:57:55,860
was always a struggle to keep it running in such a small town

2549
03:57:57,380 --> 03:58:04,420
and now we've lost it I know that I can't afford to support this now there's only one way out

2550
03:58:05,460 --> 03:58:12,340
I'm sure you won't be able to understand the depth of despair that would enable mother to

2551
03:58:12,420 --> 03:58:18,900
put a rope around a baby's neck and push him into the air and jump after her

2552
03:58:20,660 --> 03:58:27,700
and when your father makes me know if she kicks around and takes a long time to strangle

2553
03:58:29,060 --> 03:58:36,100
else for you I won't cut her down I've got to be stronger than I ever was before

2554
03:58:36,100 --> 03:58:39,860
but I hope she doesn't get it

2555
03:58:41,940 --> 03:58:44,260
God help us and forgive us

2556
03:58:55,220 --> 03:58:59,860
oh they're showing it huh

2557
03:59:07,060 --> 03:59:11,860
is is that the sheriff

2558
03:59:27,540 --> 03:59:29,860
who cooked his food

2559
03:59:31,860 --> 03:59:33,860
I feel so bad

2560
03:59:36,420 --> 03:59:43,540
now he has no place to eat

2561
03:59:47,860 --> 03:59:57,860
I'm sorry I get a tan

2562
04:00:06,580 --> 04:00:13,380
seeing you here again when it rains it pours isn't that so first Edna goes through all that with

2563
04:00:13,380 --> 04:00:20,340
her daughter then she loses her diner if that happened to me I'd hang myself

2564
04:00:23,140 --> 04:00:23,860
drop in again

2565
04:00:24,660 --> 04:00:30,180

2566
04:00:30,420 --> 04:00:36,660

2567
04:00:40,340 --> 04:00:45,140

2568
04:00:45,140 --> 04:00:48,020
one must be done and now they're making me feel bad

2569
04:00:49,860 --> 04:00:54,740
like everyone else they're like oh they deserved it Edna though no she never deserved any of that

2570
04:00:54,980 --> 04:00:58,580
why do you like that

2571
04:01:03,460 --> 04:01:08,660
think about taking some of that siding off my hand son I'll cut you a nice price on it

2572
04:01:09,220 --> 04:01:16,340
the tv station burning downs being good for business lots of folks are thinking of investing

2573
04:01:16,660 --> 04:01:17,860
and I murdered her yeah

2574
04:01:20,740 --> 04:01:26,660
nice to see you again Steve I can't talk now son I'm busy with this game

2575
04:01:27,540 --> 04:01:34,180
ain't that a kick in the head first we lose the only barber in town in poop no more diner either

2576
04:01:34,740 --> 04:01:40,340
why don't they beat all and now that the tv station's burning down maybe folks will get off

2577
04:01:40,340 --> 04:01:49,540
their duff and get outdoors maybe take up alien hunting say clown will aluminum siding protect

2578

2579
04:01:57,060 --> 04:02:05,380
aluminum siding trust me leads to take just my luck anytime Steve

2580
04:02:11,700 --> 04:02:15,300

2583
04:02:30,260 --> 04:02:37,940

2584
04:02:40,820 --> 04:02:43,220

2588
04:03:01,300 --> 04:03:02,500
about the general store

2589
04:03:02,500 --> 04:03:16,420
hello Steve I don't mind telling you when I heard what happened to the diner I went out and got me

2590
04:03:16,420 --> 04:03:22,900
extra insurance right away I have no desire to wind up dangling from my rafters like Edna

2591
04:03:22,900 --> 04:03:29,940
believe you me Steve did you see the fire as I was watching the tv station go up

2592
04:03:30,660 --> 04:03:37,620
I was reminded of the old Sentinel building when you think about it you know two communication

2593
04:03:37,620 --> 04:03:42,340
complexes going up in smoke you have to wonder if it was a coincidence

2594
04:03:46,580 --> 04:03:49,540
hello Steve well I bought everything from her

2595
04:03:52,020 --> 04:03:54,180
yeah well she bought extra insurance

2596
04:03:54,900 --> 04:04:02,500

2598
04:04:13,620 --> 04:04:21,220
well I guess the wasp lady's okay she's fine well let's see what this guy says oh we hate this guy

2599
04:04:22,100 --> 04:04:29,940
sorry Steve too tired to talk right now I just gave the Tucker a tune up I'll talk to you later

2600
04:04:30,820 --> 04:04:39,540
DNA's diner burned down what a shame women running things that's the problem if she'd

2601
04:04:39,540 --> 04:04:48,820
had a man around that fire never would have happened what a waste damn terrible thing that business

2602
04:04:48,820 --> 04:04:55,380
with the tv station I can't sleep now we hate some waking up in a cold sweat

2603
04:04:56,820 --> 04:05:02,980
I'm thinking of getting some fireproof aluminum siding for my garage we hate some that's a good

2604
04:05:02,980 --> 04:05:03,940
I hate some

2605
04:05:07,540 --> 04:05:13,140

2606
04:05:14,100 --> 04:05:21,140
hmm I don't like that I don't like it no Sherry that woman was the voice of reason

2607
04:05:28,660 --> 04:05:30,100
that one was the voice of reason

2608
04:05:35,940 --> 04:05:39,380
nah and now it's a real one young man we real

2609
04:05:40,180 --> 04:05:44,820
the WHAR fire is just another example of the vagaries of my profession

2610
04:05:46,340 --> 04:05:53,940
odd after such a catastrophic conflagration not to have any fatalities disappointing in a way

2611
04:05:54,900 --> 04:05:58,020
I might have gotten some paying customers for a change

2612
04:05:58,900 --> 04:06:01,300
okay so nobody died

2613
04:06:15,620 --> 04:06:17,860

2625
04:07:34,260 --> 04:07:40,020
lesson in good citizenship to these youngsters I'm sure one of these precious darlings burnt

2626
04:07:40,020 --> 04:07:47,380
down the television station and they if the little shits could talk I'm sure I'd find out who but as it is

2627
04:07:52,980 --> 04:07:58,340
I guess everyone will have to take my special civics course again

2628
04:08:01,060 --> 04:08:05,540

2642
04:09:26,340 --> 04:09:27,540

2643
04:09:28,340 --> 04:09:30,900

2677
04:14:13,140 --> 04:14:14,100
she she dead

2678
04:14:14,100 --> 04:14:21,620
god is that what I think it is yep it's a spinal cord is it Stephanie

2679
04:14:23,220 --> 04:14:33,060
I can see a resemblance but I can't be sure more pie sheriff pie don't you realize what's happened

2680
04:14:35,940 --> 04:14:41,860
oh indeed I do I can just hear the tongue waging at the pta

2681
04:14:42,580 --> 04:14:46,260
was it suicide

2682
04:14:48,020 --> 04:14:54,260
never heard of anyone pulling their own spinal cord out before off the record I'd have to say nope

2683
04:14:55,460 --> 04:15:03,460
no all in all I'd say this was dead by natural causes natural causes natural causes

2684
04:15:05,620 --> 04:15:10,500
you can't live without a spinal cord son nothing unnatural about that

2685
04:15:12,180 --> 04:15:13,700
think I will have some more pie

2686
04:15:17,620 --> 04:15:28,980
right away I can't believe this well I guess he has a point believe me you get to the point

2687
04:15:28,980 --> 04:15:31,300
to where this is routine

2688
04:15:31,940 --> 04:15:41,620
now the only clue we got is that card on her pillow take a look at it

2689
04:15:45,300 --> 04:15:49,700
I can't fucking read that be it known that the sacred order of the

2690
04:15:49,700 --> 04:15:56,340
practically confession confession to watch son murder isn't that what you're here to investigate

2691
04:15:56,660 --> 04:16:04,740
son you don't investigate natural deaths no point then I'll get to the bottom of this myself

2692
04:16:06,180 --> 04:16:09,300
yeah I'm sure you will

2693
04:16:12,580 --> 04:16:13,860
more pie sheriff

2694
04:16:17,060 --> 04:16:18,500
don't mind if I do

2695
04:16:18,660 --> 04:16:28,260
all right let's take a look at that card again

2696
04:16:31,620 --> 04:16:33,540
I guess we got the lodge invitation

2697
04:16:36,100 --> 04:16:38,020
hello Steve have some pie

2698
04:16:41,220 --> 04:16:42,820
there's skeleton in the family closet

2699
04:16:44,180 --> 04:16:47,300
we're going to put her in the crypt keeping bodies in the house

2700
04:16:47,300 --> 04:16:54,020
it's just not sanitary I see I don't suppose it'd hurt for you to take the card

2701
04:16:54,740 --> 04:16:56,420
seeing as it was addressed to you

2702
04:16:57,540 --> 04:16:58,580
the shucks

2703
04:16:58,580 --> 04:17:00,420
senpai senpai

2704
04:17:01,700 --> 04:17:05,940
but that's my job so I wonder if there's more pie

2705
04:17:08,980 --> 04:17:12,340
thank you boy for the 420 tip

2706
04:17:13,060 --> 04:17:15,620
a lot of senpais died in natural causes

2707
04:17:17,060 --> 04:17:18,500
oh it happens you know

2708
04:17:21,940 --> 04:17:28,180
it just happens when and senpai's being a little oh shh low guy

2709
04:17:29,700 --> 04:17:32,500
we got the invitation in the end at what cost

2710
04:17:33,380 --> 04:17:36,740
I'm so hungry Steve so hungry

2711
04:17:37,140 --> 04:17:43,620
if I'd been an astronaut I could afford all the meat I want the red kind

2712
04:17:44,820 --> 04:17:47,620
and the young pink kind too

2713
04:17:48,340 --> 04:17:49,140
pink kind

2714
04:17:51,780 --> 04:17:58,180
okay they said family crypt right well I guess we're going there again

2715
04:18:01,060 --> 04:18:01,700
here we go

2716
04:18:01,700 --> 04:18:03,700
oh

2717
04:18:07,140 --> 04:18:10,740
I'm only full of cannibals yeah here we go again

2718
04:18:12,580 --> 04:18:17,860
oh right in time my rash is starting to act up damn it there we go

2719
04:18:23,540 --> 04:18:26,020
no I thought that was the hint

2720
04:18:26,340 --> 04:18:28,980
okay

2721
04:18:30,980 --> 04:18:36,180
I I pre-booked I thought I thought she would be yours or there was a hint about that

2722
04:18:37,300 --> 04:18:37,620
okay

2723
04:18:41,060 --> 04:18:42,420
is your arm any better now

2724
04:18:44,660 --> 04:18:48,900
well it's slightly I might have to go get the ice pack again what does the note say

2725
04:18:48,900 --> 04:18:50,500
hold on

2726
04:18:53,220 --> 04:18:55,140
I'll go back to my house to look at the note

2727
04:18:57,940 --> 04:18:59,300
where is the note there it is

2728
04:19:01,220 --> 04:19:09,220
be it known that the sacred order of the harvest moon hereby extends notice of the eligibility

2729
04:19:09,220 --> 04:19:15,540
of Steve Mason her niche initiation into the sacred mysteries of the harvest let me

2730
04:19:15,540 --> 04:19:20,180
presented with all the possible haste to sergeant and arms for

2731
04:19:22,660 --> 04:19:24,820
for commencement of the rites

2732
04:19:27,780 --> 04:19:30,100
okay I wish my rash would leave me alone too

2733
04:19:34,260 --> 04:19:35,300
if we have to meet him now

2734
04:19:40,020 --> 04:19:40,980
what do you want from me

2735
04:19:40,980 --> 04:19:48,020
you received the invitation but you have not brought it

2736
04:19:50,180 --> 04:19:56,340
what do you mean brought what I don't understand the invitation was not the card

2737
04:19:57,060 --> 04:20:03,140
but the spinal cord it must be presented to me I have to get the spinal cord

2738
04:20:03,220 --> 04:20:04,500
you to enter

2739
04:20:09,700 --> 04:20:13,060
you expect me to steal their mains and bring them here you stick bastard

2740
04:20:19,380 --> 04:20:20,900
he wants the freaking spine

2741
04:20:21,540 --> 04:20:30,180
you were provided an invitation bring me the skull and spinal cord if you would pass to the

2742
04:20:30,180 --> 04:20:41,540
world beyond okay I don't understand what's the other one I you were provided and okay okay

2743
04:20:41,540 --> 04:20:42,980
well I go back now I guess

2744
04:20:45,780 --> 04:20:46,740
looks like I go back

2745
04:20:54,580 --> 04:20:58,340
if this is this a metaphor to grow a spine probably

2746
04:21:00,420 --> 04:21:02,820
well I already grave robbed so we're fine

2747
04:21:03,380 --> 04:21:07,460
here we go

2748
04:21:09,860 --> 04:21:16,340
back at it again we already did this I did this way earlier that's so funny

2749
04:21:17,700 --> 04:21:20,740
that's so funny that I already did this I did things out of order

2750
04:21:20,900 --> 04:21:28,900
okay get over here

2751
04:21:32,180 --> 04:21:35,780
it says reference to sub zero's fatality oh yeah that makes sense

2752
04:21:37,300 --> 04:21:39,060
here you go you stinking bitch

2753
04:21:39,620 --> 04:21:48,260
ah you have done well now let the initiation commence as your mystic

2754
04:21:48,980 --> 04:21:49,620
mystic ag

2755
04:21:49,620 --> 04:22:00,420
requested and required that I turn over this sacred dagger to you to aid you in your quest

2756
04:22:02,740 --> 04:22:07,380
what is this what the heck you just gave me the logo

2757
04:22:07,460 --> 04:22:15,940
you must now enter the lodge initiates find it our style place are you supposed to help me

2758
04:22:15,940 --> 04:22:25,860
or get me killed I'm starting you on the path of initiation to a very special very exclusive

2759
04:22:25,860 --> 04:22:35,300
brotherhood I am merely the administrator of a test whether you view me as an enemy

2760
04:22:35,300 --> 04:22:44,420
or a friend depends on how well you're prepared to pass this thing you haven't said what it is

2761
04:22:45,060 --> 04:22:51,380
it is a special weapon using it will be part of the initiation

2762
04:22:51,380 --> 04:23:00,260
the hell with your initiation

2763
04:23:03,540 --> 04:23:14,020
okay whatever occurs in here is relevant to the great question which you cannot help but answer

2764
04:23:14,740 --> 04:23:23,860
what is at issue is whether in answering the question you will find the answers you seek

2765
04:23:24,660 --> 04:23:31,460
you will encounter those intent on preventing or prompting your answer depending on how you

2766
04:23:31,460 --> 04:23:42,900
look at it while the assumption is you want to live dying is easy and provides its own answer

2767
04:23:42,900 --> 04:23:50,580
but not for you just tell me is Stephanie dead or being held within the membership director

2768
04:23:50,580 --> 04:23:58,100
on the second level keeps track of such wow you just talked a lot then you are against me

2769
04:23:58,900 --> 04:24:07,060
I am the sergeant at arms I am here to ensure that the protocols are observed

2770
04:24:07,700 --> 04:24:15,060
deviation from a protocol shall result in punishment remember what I have told you

2771
04:24:15,780 --> 04:24:24,100
now let the initiation begin yeah making him deliver that much exposition with that with

2772
04:24:24,100 --> 04:24:33,620
that voice is a lot not again the third disc

2773
04:24:37,780 --> 04:24:48,260
it worked the first time give me a second save and give me another second some pie I'm gonna have to

2774
04:24:55,060 --> 04:25:02,820
my arm itchy I'm gonna have to get the um oh what's the word

2775
04:25:07,300 --> 04:25:12,020
congrats on completing the tutorial Kohai thank you I need to ice my arm again

2776
04:25:14,820 --> 04:25:16,420
I need to ice my arm again okay

2777
04:25:16,420 --> 04:25:21,940
okay I'll BRB some pie

2778
04:27:46,820 --> 04:28:11,140
okay okay some pie I have the ice pack on me so my my hands my arm movement is very limited

2779
04:28:11,140 --> 04:28:18,820
so we're gonna try anyways let's see how this goes

2780
04:28:30,020 --> 04:28:36,580
hopefully it calms down for the night I normally I would I think I would take some

2781
04:28:36,580 --> 04:28:46,180
Benadryl but I don't want to get sleepy because I want to see if uh if if I can finish this

2782
04:28:48,740 --> 04:28:57,060
oh you're here excellent you'll find them through that door excuse me you are the exterminator

2783
04:28:57,060 --> 04:29:03,380
are you not no in that case I'm afraid you'll have a hard time of it sir

2784
04:29:04,340 --> 04:29:12,100
recently the lodge has become infested by pests they need exterminating or

2785
04:29:12,660 --> 04:29:17,700
you were a part of the lodge this whole time they need killing and plenty

2786
04:29:22,100 --> 04:29:27,380
that's the quickest way to the second level the second floor sir the entrance is hidden

2787
04:29:27,380 --> 04:29:34,740
but a little reflection should reveal the answer to find the key to the second floor

2788
04:29:34,740 --> 04:29:43,300
reach deep within yourself I wish you good luck sir I only hope you can stomach what's ahead

2789
04:29:45,060 --> 04:29:45,460
okay

2790
04:29:48,180 --> 04:29:51,460
bust of George Washington glares down at you in silent reboot

2791
04:29:52,420 --> 04:29:59,940
bust of Barbara Bush glares down at you Benjamin Franklin glares down at you

2792
04:29:59,940 --> 04:30:06,980

2795
04:30:20,740 --> 04:30:21,620

2802
04:31:30,740 --> 04:31:35,220
a nauseous pool of acid covered by a nutrient film

2803
04:31:35,300 --> 04:31:38,260

2804
04:31:59,300 --> 04:32:04,340

sort like kill it

2806
04:32:16,260 --> 04:32:20,900

3006
04:59:42,660 --> 04:59:48,980

3007
04:59:53,220 --> 04:59:59,380
right

3008
04:59:59,380 --> 05:00:06,340

3016
05:01:01,860 --> 05:01:03,060

give me a second I'll just equip this then yeah

3018
05:01:11,780 --> 05:01:13,780

3019
05:01:15,300 --> 05:01:22,260
no seriously however was that was that the part where they're like oh well um

3020
05:01:30,340 --> 05:01:35,620
I don't know that was that where they were selling hints hints

3021
05:01:36,180 --> 05:01:43,780

3025
05:02:18,980 --> 05:02:26,020

3026
05:02:29,140 --> 05:02:32,180
okay we're gonna save here you would call in

3027
05:02:35,220 --> 05:02:38,340
you would call in or you would buy a hint book

3028
05:02:39,300 --> 05:02:45,060
and in order to help you and a lot of games purposely made it really obtuse

3029
05:02:53,700 --> 05:03:00,340
was was really obtuse to uh to get was there something in the the hint room

3030
05:03:01,300 --> 05:03:04,260

3031
05:03:11,460 --> 05:03:16,660

3032
05:03:18,980 --> 05:03:19,620

3033
05:03:23,620 --> 05:03:24,660
sorry I don't see anything

3034
05:03:30,500 --> 05:03:34,500
I switch in the cloak room oh this

3035
05:03:34,580 --> 05:03:34,660
this

3036
05:03:51,300 --> 05:03:54,660
oh

3037
05:04:04,500 --> 05:04:11,500
It crashed!

3038
05:04:34,500 --> 05:04:44,500
Is it not going to appear again?

3039
05:04:44,500 --> 05:04:54,500
Is it not going to appear again?

3040
05:05:04,500 --> 05:05:12,500
Oh no, it's not capturing!

3041
05:05:12,500 --> 05:05:23,500
Senpai is not capturing right now!

3042
05:05:23,500 --> 05:05:28,500
I think I'll take this as a sign, Senpai.

3043
05:05:28,500 --> 05:05:37,500
I'll take this as a sign to stop right now.

3044
05:05:37,500 --> 05:05:46,500
I think this is the sign.

3045
05:05:46,500 --> 05:05:54,500
It's going to just catten.

3046
05:05:54,500 --> 05:06:02,500
Wow, Senpai! It looks like we're going to have to return to this game another day.

3047
05:06:02,500 --> 05:06:14,500
I'm pretty sure we're very close to the end, so it'll probably be the game and then probably another game if I finish earlier.

3048
05:06:14,500 --> 05:06:22,500
But oh man, did it crash!

3049
05:06:22,500 --> 05:06:27,500
It's okay, I'm so happy to have all my Senpais here with me.

3050
05:06:27,500 --> 05:06:32,500
So let's check my schedule.

3051
05:06:32,500 --> 05:06:40,500
Okie dokie.

3052
05:06:40,500 --> 05:06:46,500
Tomorrow is my day off.

3053
05:06:46,500 --> 05:06:52,500
Tomorrow is my day off and then I will have my karaoke on Sunday.

3054
05:06:52,500 --> 05:06:58,500
And then I'll post my upcoming schedule around Sunday, probably.

3055
05:06:58,500 --> 05:07:01,500
Yes, most likely.

3056
05:07:01,500 --> 05:07:07,500
So I hope, oh man, I feel bad that we haven't finished the game, but hey, it crashed!

3057
05:07:07,500 --> 05:07:10,500
What else are we going to do?

3058
05:07:10,500 --> 05:07:14,500
Thank you for the 420 almighty hair on!

3059
05:07:15,500 --> 05:07:24,500
When a lovely Senpai you are.

3060
05:07:24,500 --> 05:07:42,500
I'm excited for karaoke, but I'm also a little nervous, so I hope Senpai doesn't mind if I'm not the greatest singer, but I'm trying!

3061
05:07:42,500 --> 05:07:45,500
And that's the idol way, right?

3062
05:07:45,500 --> 05:07:52,500
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your, your arrow idol.

3063
05:07:52,500 --> 05:07:56,500
In training! Well, maybe I am already an idol.

3064
05:07:56,500 --> 05:08:05,500
Oh well.

3065
05:08:06,500 --> 05:08:09,500
It's the hardest I count, so I'm going to try my best.

3066
05:08:09,500 --> 05:08:12,500
I'll try my best for Senpai.

3067
05:08:12,500 --> 05:08:19,500
What exactly is an arrow idol?

3068
05:08:19,500 --> 05:08:30,500
Well, if you take away the A, what does it say?

3069
05:08:35,500 --> 05:08:48,500
Senpai, figure it out!

3070
05:08:48,500 --> 05:08:51,500
Good job Senpai, I'm proud of you!

3071
05:08:51,500 --> 05:08:55,500
Remember, use your brains, and your eyes.

3072
05:08:55,500 --> 05:09:01,500
Your eyes and your brain.

3073
05:09:01,500 --> 05:09:03,500
It's okay Senpai.

3074
05:09:03,500 --> 05:09:07,500
We got, we have to, we have to be a little sneaky here.

3075
05:09:07,500 --> 05:09:12,500
We have to be a little sneaky here.

3076
05:09:12,500 --> 05:09:16,500
It's okay, I forgive you.

3077
05:09:16,500 --> 05:09:19,500
That's asking a lot, Kohai. No it's not!

3078
05:09:19,500 --> 05:09:25,500
Heck, I'll even, I'll even put in some books into the cages so you'll read.

3079
05:09:25,500 --> 05:09:32,500
Like a Moby Dick, or a Skylight Letter, or a Picture of Dorian Gray.

3080
05:09:32,500 --> 05:09:37,500
You can have a lot of books to read and then your mind will open.

3081
05:09:37,500 --> 05:09:47,500
Or I'll open your mind myself using an axe.

3082
05:09:47,500 --> 05:09:52,500
Can we get some Hamlets? Sure.

3083
05:09:52,500 --> 05:09:55,500
How about the Mysterious Island?

3084
05:09:55,500 --> 05:10:00,500
I've got, what book do I have?

3085
05:10:00,500 --> 05:10:05,500
Hold on, Senpai, I have a book about an island just for you.

3086
05:10:05,500 --> 05:10:09,500
The Island of Dr. Moro. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3087
05:10:09,500 --> 05:10:13,500
The Island of Dr. Moro. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3088
05:10:13,500 --> 05:10:31,500
Yeah, where's Waddle? Where's Waddle? Where's Waddle? Where's Waddle? It's too easy.

3089
05:10:31,500 --> 05:10:34,500
Can we read Cardcaptor Sakura instead?

3090
05:10:34,500 --> 05:10:37,500
Did you even watch Cardcaptor Sakura?

3091
05:10:37,500 --> 05:10:42,500
Speaking of, speaking of Senpai.

3092
05:10:42,500 --> 05:10:56,500
Did you do your homework yet?

3093
05:10:56,500 --> 05:11:01,500
We still have time. Of course you have time.

3094
05:11:01,500 --> 05:11:07,500
I just wanted to make sure earlier you start the Moro free time you have.

3095
05:11:07,500 --> 05:11:10,500
This class has homework?

3096
05:11:10,500 --> 05:11:15,500
Yep. I can explain. Yeah, about that.

3097
05:11:15,500 --> 05:11:20,500
Well, I'm going to expect my thousand word essay. It's very, I'm being very lenient.

3098
05:11:20,500 --> 05:11:27,500
And your thousand word essay do by, I think I said, I said in three weeks, right?

3099
05:11:27,500 --> 05:11:34,500
So that means this is week one. No, this would be week two.

3100
05:11:34,500 --> 05:11:43,500
You have one more week.

3101
05:11:43,500 --> 05:11:49,500
Wait, what's the essay on? Cardcaptor Sakura?

3102
05:11:49,500 --> 05:11:55,500
Cardcaptor Sakura. Everyone needs to watch.

3103
05:11:55,500 --> 05:11:59,500
Everyone needs to watch Cardcaptor Sakura in the two movies.

3104
05:11:59,500 --> 05:12:01,500
Where do we post it?

3105
05:12:01,500 --> 05:12:07,500
I'll post it on my Twitter and then everyone can reply underneath.

3106
05:12:07,500 --> 05:12:16,500
Does it matter how it's written? I'll take MLA citation.

3107
05:12:16,500 --> 05:12:28,500
What about clear card? Clear card is unnecessary. That's only bonus material.

3108
05:12:28,500 --> 05:12:35,500
That's bonus material. You don't have to do that. It's only if you really want to.

3109
05:12:35,500 --> 05:12:39,500
I'll take MLA citation or APA.

3110
05:12:39,500 --> 05:12:45,500
Make sure to alphabetize it.

3111
05:12:45,500 --> 05:12:49,500
Google docs. Not Google.

3112
05:12:49,500 --> 05:12:55,500
Not Google. You have to send it in.

3113
05:12:55,500 --> 05:12:59,500
Actually, better yet. Marles. I'll give you a grade.

3114
05:12:59,500 --> 05:13:15,500
If you send it through Marles, I'll give you a grade on it.

3115
05:13:15,500 --> 05:13:32,500
What's our reward? You want some motivation?

3116
05:13:32,500 --> 05:13:37,500
What's more motivating than a job well done?

3117
05:13:37,500 --> 05:13:45,500
In a little phrase. Heck, I'll tell you I'm proud of you.

3118
05:13:45,500 --> 05:13:51,500
Does Marle have a max word count? I think it's a thousand, which is what I'm saying.

3119
05:13:51,500 --> 05:14:02,500
I'll make it 500. 500 word. How about that? 500 word essay.

3120
05:14:02,500 --> 05:14:10,500
The card after your localization is okay. Yeah, localization is okay too.

3121
05:14:10,500 --> 05:14:27,500
I think Marle is exactly a thousand. I was going to say a thousand characters. It'll be fine.

3122
05:14:27,500 --> 05:14:41,500
You have to write about how much you liked it and how great Sakura is and what you think about the series.

3123
05:14:41,500 --> 05:14:45,500
I want you to learn from it. There you go. I mean so nice.

3124
05:14:45,500 --> 05:14:50,500
I would just torture everyone and be like, you have to watch it in these days and if you don't.

3125
05:14:50,500 --> 05:15:07,500
Well, I guess there's a free vacancy in the cage.

3126
05:15:07,500 --> 05:15:13,500
Honestly. Honestly, I just think it's just fun.

3127
05:15:13,500 --> 05:15:21,500
I think it'll be fun if I can talk to my senpai about something that I really love.

3128
05:15:21,500 --> 05:15:34,500
I actually really like the Novana one. Novana? Is that the company? I like the Novana dub. That's the one I grew up with.

3129
05:15:34,500 --> 05:15:48,500
So I want something in common with senpai and what's better way to connect our hearts than through anime.

3130
05:15:48,500 --> 05:15:59,500
Can I write about how much I love Mercy? You can do that as bonus work.

3131
05:15:59,500 --> 05:16:11,500
I think it'll be fun though. I think all of us watching something together would be really fun.

3132
05:16:11,500 --> 05:16:17,500
And so I can gap about it and everyone will be like, oh okay, I get it. I understand.

3133
05:16:17,500 --> 05:16:24,500
The one from the early 2000s? Yes, that one.

3134
05:16:24,500 --> 05:16:37,500
Do we have to do our sources? No, but it's just fun to mess with you.

3135
05:16:37,500 --> 05:16:42,500
I'm not going to do a watch along on YouTube simply because, wow.

3136
05:16:42,500 --> 05:16:49,500
I'm getting in trouble. I'm getting bonked. I'm getting a little spanky.

3137
05:16:49,500 --> 05:16:56,500
I get a little spanky. So I don't want to do that. I don't want to get in trouble.

3138
05:16:56,500 --> 05:17:16,500
I worked really hard. I worked really hard senpai to not get bonked by YouTube.

3139
05:17:16,500 --> 05:17:25,500
So I worked really hard. I've even been like, I hope I don't get in trouble for uncensoring now.

3140
05:17:25,500 --> 05:17:31,500
But now that I've got monetization, then they can take it away at any point.

3141
05:17:31,500 --> 05:17:40,500
Thank you, boy, for your $1 tip. Congrats on 5,140 subscribers.

3142
05:17:40,500 --> 05:17:47,500
We can celebrate karaoke, right? Do I have 5K already? Thank you.

3143
05:17:47,500 --> 05:17:54,500
Thank you, everyone, for your support then. I really appreciate that.

3144
05:17:54,500 --> 05:18:00,500
My next big goal will be 10K. What do you think?

3145
05:18:01,500 --> 05:18:09,500
Had you been censored on your model this whole time? Oh, yep.

3146
05:18:09,500 --> 05:18:16,500
Will you be able to do song requests on your street on Sunday?

3147
05:18:16,500 --> 05:18:25,500
I don't think so, mostly because I practice these songs.

3148
05:18:25,500 --> 05:18:29,500
10K sounds easy. I don't know. That sounds kind of hard.

3149
05:18:29,500 --> 05:18:38,500
Do you have a favorite Sakura outfit? I love the cat outfit and I love the prince outfit as well.

3150
05:18:38,500 --> 05:18:48,500
I think those are really cute.

3151
05:18:48,500 --> 05:18:52,500
You could do 10K without even trying? Really?

3152
05:18:52,500 --> 05:18:58,500
I don't know. That seems really hard.

3153
05:18:58,500 --> 05:19:05,500
I mean, I would be super happy if we reached 10K, but do you need to watch the movies too?

3154
05:19:05,500 --> 05:19:19,500
Yes, of course. That's how the series ends. It's within the movies. That's how it ends.

3155
05:19:19,500 --> 05:19:25,500
It's really nice. Also, the first movie is really nice and the second movie is really nice too. I think they're really good.

3156
05:19:25,500 --> 05:19:29,500
It's possible. Let's hope.

3157
05:19:29,500 --> 05:19:38,500
My biggest goal is going to be 100K, so Mama Mercy can be like,

3158
05:19:38,500 --> 05:19:47,500
Oh, look, you got a play button. That's nice.

3159
05:19:47,500 --> 05:20:01,500
But you remember us when you get famous? Of course. I always remember all my supplies.

3160
05:20:01,500 --> 05:20:08,500
Is there a manga too or does anime and movies cover it all? The anime and movie pretty much cover it all.

3161
05:20:08,500 --> 05:20:18,500
Actually, the anime has more stuff than the manga.

3162
05:20:18,500 --> 05:20:26,500
Will you name the button after your parents if you can put anything on it? I think I'll just put myself on it.

3163
05:20:26,500 --> 05:20:35,500
I'll get a bigger cage if we get 100K. I'll get a bigger cage for everyone.

3164
05:20:35,500 --> 05:20:53,500
I think if I can order more than one, I think I'd like to give the allure one, strong one, and then get my own.

3165
05:20:53,500 --> 05:21:03,500
I think I'll keep it as my channel title as a memento of it.

3166
05:21:03,500 --> 05:21:13,500
You can order more, but it does cost. I'm willing to pay for the cost of it.

3167
05:21:13,500 --> 05:21:20,500
I'm willing to pay for the cost of it.

3168
05:21:20,500 --> 05:21:26,500
Or getting one to me as well.

3169
05:21:26,500 --> 05:21:35,500
I really want one. Mama's been trying to give me suggestions on how to get to 100K really fast and she was like,

3170
05:21:35,500 --> 05:21:57,500
Sweetie, you should do a film tour of the Costco. People are always interested in watching Costco.

3171
05:21:57,500 --> 05:22:05,500
Yeah, Costco's vlog.

3172
05:22:05,500 --> 05:22:17,500
I don't think I can show a tour of the local Costco because I think that would dox me hard.

3173
05:22:17,500 --> 05:22:29,500
But I admit, I'm pretty sure there's a lot of people who are very interested in Costco.

3174
05:22:29,500 --> 05:22:37,500
Costco dream date. Cost effective and free samples.

3175
05:22:37,500 --> 05:22:44,500
Show off the Costco rotisserie chicken. Yeah, actually those are pretty good.

3176
05:22:44,500 --> 05:22:49,500
I've never seen one, so I just did. You can pass the laptops.

3177
05:22:49,500 --> 05:22:58,500
ASMRRP concept virtual Costco tour.

3178
05:22:58,500 --> 05:23:09,500
I think my favorite, you stalk images and pretend I'm taking you through Costco.

3179
05:23:09,500 --> 05:23:17,500
Oh, that'll be so funny. Okay, I'll see when I can do some pie.

3180
05:23:17,500 --> 05:23:33,500
Imagine if Costco sponsors us. That's not going to happen. We're definitely not family friendly.

3181
05:23:33,500 --> 05:23:42,500
Are there VR chat? I don't think I have a model for or I don't even have like a regular model.

3182
05:23:42,500 --> 05:23:46,500
Costco's family friendly?

3183
05:23:46,500 --> 05:23:54,500
Well, yeah.

3184
05:23:54,500 --> 05:23:59,500
I think so. Yeah.

3185
05:23:59,500 --> 05:24:04,500
Anyways.

3186
05:24:04,500 --> 05:24:09,500
Oh, I'm getting a little, little, I'm getting the little eye burns.

3187
05:24:09,500 --> 05:24:13,500
So I'm going to guess that I'm getting really, really tired.

3188
05:24:13,500 --> 05:24:16,500
He's a placeholder model.

3189
05:24:16,500 --> 05:24:25,500
I'm getting really tired. So I'm looking forward to tomorrow being my day off and then I can hang out with some friends if I wanted to or just rest the entire day.

3190
05:24:25,500 --> 05:24:27,500
Who knows?

3191
05:24:27,500 --> 05:24:35,500
Mercy, your mouth is the most expressive I've ever seen. Excuse me.

3192
05:24:35,500 --> 05:24:40,500
I think it's because I'm an expressive person.

3193
05:24:40,500 --> 05:24:56,500
I think it's because I'm an expressive person. Otherwise, otherwise, I think it would be pretty much the same as any of my other gen mites.

3194
05:24:57,500 --> 05:25:02,500
But yeah, I'll take a good slaps.

3195
05:25:02,500 --> 05:25:19,500
But yeah, I look forward to seeing my supplies on Sunday. I may need breaks if, for example, you know, once again, my arm decides to flare up and be, be, be bad.

3196
05:25:19,500 --> 05:25:24,500
So yeah, I hope everyone has a good one. Okay.

3197
05:25:24,500 --> 05:25:28,500
And I'll see you again next time.

3198
05:25:28,500 --> 05:25:32,500
Speaking for Mercy! Bye!

3199
05:25:54,500 --> 05:25:59,500
Thanks for watching!
