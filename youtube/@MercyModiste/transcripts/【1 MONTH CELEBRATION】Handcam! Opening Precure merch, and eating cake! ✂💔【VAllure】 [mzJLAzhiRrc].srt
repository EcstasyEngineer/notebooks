1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
And

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:07,540
do

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,560
it

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,220
in

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,960
the

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:29,000
sixth

7
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:57,040
Alright.

8
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,580
Oh,

9
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,940
Oh, me de tolo.

10
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,640
Welcome to the stream.

11
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,240
This is actually not a cake.

12
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,580
It's a cinnamon roll,

13
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,880
but you would never know until I told you so.

14
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,780
Ho, ho, ho.

15
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:33,820
Hello! My lovely senpai! Congratulations for our one month! One month of us being together

16
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:45,100
forever! Thank you Griffin for the 50! I'm gonna show you something special! I don't know

17
00:06:45,100 --> 00:07:00,660
if you can see it yet but I'm gonna show you something special! It's my hands! Look I even

18
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:15,940
put the bandages on and the fingies! More accurate hands! I'm very proud of this one! Look at that!

19
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:25,780
My mummy wrapping hands! Thank you for the two crown on time! One month down!

20
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:39,220
Eternity to go! Yeah! Wait you have hands? Yeah! See? Hold on! See? Yeah! Here are my hands!

21
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:51,140
And I have canonically bandages on my hands so I put on the bandages.

22
00:07:51,700 --> 00:08:00,420
There you go! Senpai! Oh it's actually played! I can't! I'm making hearts!

23
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:17,700
Wow! Wow! This is my cake! It says omedetto!

24
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:27,460
Oh yeah! You can have a little sniff of the cake! You can't eat it though!

25
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,500
It's a cake! A cinnamon roll is a cake right? Because it's technically a cinnamon roll.

26
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,980
Is it vegan or made with no eggs? It's vegan! It's actually vegan! The cinnamon roll is actually

27
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:52,500
vegan! So there's no eggs! So I'm safe Senpai! But I also have a bunch of things that I can open up.

28
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,340
Hold on! I'm gonna see if I can eat the cake! The cinnamon roll cake! You'll start seeing it unravel!

29
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,700
Maybe I should have eaten the stuff!

30
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:21,940
We'll save the cake for later!

31
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,300
Actually I'll eat the cake over here! Away from the camera!

32
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,340
Maybe I should have brought a knife with me!

33
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,980
It's so sweet!

34
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:58,500
Anyways! Wow! Talking with my mouth full! Today I have some stuff I can open up!

35
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:06,340
I have these big buttons from Wonderful Precure! I have four of them in total.

36
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:17,700
I have these magical doraimi little standees that we can open.

37
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:30,500
I think these are stickers! I have four of them as well! Oh wow! My auto white balance! Not good!

38
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:37,460
Yeah! And I think they've got candy in them and maybe a sticker!

39
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:51,140
And then I also have these guys! Which are like big big ass cards! Big cards! I totally got ripped!

40
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:59,140
Ah! Ripped off though! Careful reflections go high! Don't worry! I am leaning so far away!

41
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,980
I am leaning so far away! The chances of me getting caught may be close to zero!

42
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,260
The bottle focus is losing its mind! Yeah, I know!

43
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,820
I also have... I have nowhere to put this plate!

44
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:44,580
If we have time, I have these little origami cake shop

45
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,180
thingies that we can make cakes!

46
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,020
Not exactly zero, but I have this on like a really trusty tripod with weights on it!

47
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,540
So it is unlikely to fall over! Yeah! I've tried my best! I've tried my best some

48
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,940
Yeah! Wait here! Yeah!

49
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:23,780
Yeah! Yeah! Can I do it with the other hand? Yeah! Yeah! I think it's because of the white that it's like

50
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:29,620
yeah! It's not really good! So yeah! That is the plan for today!

51
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:36,820
As I eat this delicious cinnamon roll!

52
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,180
It does not like the wrapping! No! It doesn't like the wrapping!

53
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:51,220
It makes me look a little tan! Even though I know that I'm pretty pale!

54
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,620
Can you have a bite? No!

55
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,620
No! Maybe you can! It's very sweet!

56
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,860
It's very sweet! Oh! And I have my favorite scissors to cut open!

57
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,900
The packages!

58
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:33,060
This is so funny! Going like this! Going like so far away!

59
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,740
Like all here like this!

60
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:50,340
So yeah! You guys got all of these for the low low price of staying with me forever!

61
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,100
The special scissors! They're actually my everyday scissors!

62
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,820
Small hands! Who said small hands? You're right!

63
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,940
Senpai! Oh my gosh!

64
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:32,180
Thank you Riga Tony for the 100! I am so appreciative! Thank you everyone for being so kind to me!

65
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:43,140
So I don't know what to start with Senpai! Do I eat the cake? Do I open these things for you?

66
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,540
Do I make fake cake origamis and make you eat them?

67
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,020
It's like the only cake you're going to get are these paper ones!

68
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,260
KKSMR!

69
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,940
I don't think it can catch!

70
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,220
Open the things while eating the cake!

71
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:21,220
This is going to have to go somewhere and it's very hard to find a place to put this!

72
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:29,780
I do not have that many! I don't have that many room on my table!

73
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,500
Literally I was so worried about anything reflecting!

74
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:41,300
Or like you see that this space is the space we're working with!

75
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:50,580
Wait are those wonderful clear cards? These ones I think are stickers!

76
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,180
So they're little stickers here!

77
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,700
These ones are buttons!

78
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:04,500
So you have your your friendly, your wonderful, and I forgot these too!

79
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,500
Big death spot! No these are already big! Don't worry!

80
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:14,740
Good evening Mercy! Did you hear about the Magic Ra- Night Ra- Earth announcement?

81
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,940
The wa- the wa announcement!

82
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,380
Sorry I like choked!

83
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,020
Buttons like shirt buttons like...

84
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,020
like...

85
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,140
I call them buttons! Some places call them tin badges!

86
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,980
Some places are not!

87
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:03,060
Hold on! I'll open it and then we can figure it out together!

88
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,340
And you you can tell me what these...

89
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:19,460
Oh you're yummy! These are called so they have backing like that!

90
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,740
Yeah look they're pretty big right? Look!

91
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:35,140
Oh my gosh! Hold on! Wow! Beauty, beauty person! This is terrible!

92
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:47,300
So we have... they say big! So they're big! I don't have anything for scale for reference!

93
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:58,580
Maybe like this Vaseline pin is like a scale reference?

94
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:05,620
A coin? I don't have a coin with me Senpai! I don't have a coin with me!

95
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:13,460
It's like a yeah like a size of a cookie maybe!

96
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,580
Yeah 75 millimeters!

97
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,820
Ah metal! Metal, metal, metal, metal, metal!

98
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:29,860
But yeah you have this one! I swear if I have a double I'm gonna cry a little bit!

99
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:39,700
Scissors for scale! Okay well scissors! These are kind of small scissors though!

100
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,140
These are kind of small scissors so they're not very big! They're like craft scissors!

101
00:18:49,140 --> 00:19:00,820
Uh harmonica size reference!

102
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,420
Thank you Jamdrop for the 133!

103
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,780
Congratulations on achieving so much in one month! Thank you!

104
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,940
Happy one month Mercy! Thank you Metal!

105
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:26,660
Harmonica! Harmonica reference! What size harmonica? The average size harmonica!

106
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,380
The average size harmonica!

107
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:42,020
Anyways that's one! This guy over here! Oh shit!

108
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,980
I think I dropped a gum!

109
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,380
No! Give me my gum!

110
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,300
It comes with a free candy!

111
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,620
So that's carried yummy!

112
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,820
Let's open another one!

113
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:29,380
Here Lillian! Is it just me Senpai? Is the candy any good? I don't know! I'm not eating them yet!

114
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:34,580
Come on focus! There we go! Here Lillian!

115
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,940
I have joked about saying that she kind of looks like Suisei!

116
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,500
But maybe that's just me!

117
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,020
Green Suisei! And then candy! Sure you can have the candy later!

118
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,660
Shut the fuck up!

119
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:40,660
Siri decided to pop! Shut the fuck up!

120
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,300
Forgetting beam!

121
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:59,300
When I said Suisei!

122
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:05,620
Ahhhh! Ahhhh!

123
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:17,940
Forgetting beam! No one heard anything right?

124
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:37,700
Genuinely you guys didn't hear anything! Oh thank freaking goodness!

125
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,540
It's thank freaking goodness!

126
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,620
And then I screamed because it started to say an address!

127
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,420
And I was like!

128
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,260
That's horrifying! Yeah I was like! What the fuck!

129
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:14,020
Ahhhh! That's never happened before! We aren't gonna call stellar stellar green green stellar stellar right?

130
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,020
How do I? How do I? I literally do not know how to disable it!

131
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,420
Give me a second Senpai!

132
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,740
I feel like my heart just sank!

133
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,540
Give me a second!

134
00:23:45,700 --> 00:24:00,260
We're gonna freeze a little bit and I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna do the setting stuff!

135
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,980
Weeee!

136
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,780

137
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:27,460

Okay yeah!

141
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,340
They're both of them together! The cat and her owner!

142
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:57,220
I'm okay I'm okay!

143
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:06,820
Look at that! The cat and her owner! And look I have them separate too!

00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,980

00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:07,780
and this one is also glittery on the back! Cute! Cute! Yummy and friendly!

167
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:20,100
And okay no gummies! I have gum though! Two pieces of gum to share!

168
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:27,380
Nothing else is in here right? No good!

169
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,580
I know it's hard to see!

170
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,220
I know it's hard to see! I tried to up the brightness but then the auto balance is like

171
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:43,060
being being uh really funky wonky! Oh there you can see it more! Yeah!

172
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,260
And then the back has like the information and stuff!

173
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:02,100
It's like darkness darkness uh blind ink! It's making me look so different!

174
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,740
It's going crazy!

175
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,980
With gum! Gum be gone!

176
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,660
Yummy!

177
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,300
And another cure friendly!

178
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,340
Then on the back as well! Oh look there's like a close-up!

179
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,820
Cure Lillian! Sorry! Not yummy! Lillian! Well I'm dumb!

180
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:47,300
It's one day blinding stew but with auto balance! Yeah so they're kind of cute right?

181
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,940
I mean like I'm not going to complain they're all cute!

182
00:29:51,940 --> 00:30:00,820
Ah! Blinded! Blinded by the white lie!

183
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,980
Yeah cute! Let's do another one!

184
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:19,140
Gum!

185
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,020
They're all very sparkly!

186
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:39,300
And then oh! Yudoha! And I forgot the dog's name already!

187
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:52,180
Yeah! No dupes! Komugi! Thank you! I was like the dog!

188
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:03,700
It's like I'm so bad with names! I'm like the dog! The cat owner!

189
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,380
The dog owner! I mean like her name is Inukai! So her!

190
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,580
You're a ho! It's silly saying you're right!

191
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,780
You're right! Cute! And then the back!

192
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,700
Cure Lillian!

193
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,460
And they felt like it's a little information! Cute!

194
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,660
And I got one more Senpai!

195
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,740
Which is funny because the dog is the protagonist! I know! I know!

196
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,940
There's the dog again! Gum! I have so much candy now!

197
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,660
There's the dog! But in here a human form!

198
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:05,620
And then and then there's the dog! In the cure form! Cure! Wonderful! Wonderful!

199
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,900
For real? Yeah! This is the dog!

00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:19,700
This is the dog! The dog has a human form? Yeah! I mean like

00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,700

202
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,180
Where is she? Cure Friendly! This one's a cat!

203
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,860
This one's a cat!

204
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,340
But yeah! Here you go Senpai!

205
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,540

00:32:50,500 --> 00:33:01,140
No dupes I don't think! Unless I'm blind! Senpai!

00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,740
All these like pre-cure packaging are so cute!

00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:13,620
Where's where's my pair of scissors? I don't want to like force this to open because there's no

There she is! There's the dog and her as big your dog!

219
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:57,540
The back is just is just plain but the front is like this cute little thing.

220
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:04,420
And what's our candy?

221
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:18,100
I don't know what this candy is! It's very hard! Is this even candy? It might be a taffy!

222
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,180
It might be a taffy! I don't know it's pretty big right?

223
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:27,940
Oh yeah! So cute!

224
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,260
Taste test! I will after after my my cakey!

00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:42,500
Okay let's go on the next one! I was clumsy! Let's go on the next one!

226
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,260
Making sure it's not there! I would have cried!

227
00:35:52,500 --> 00:36:00,180
Oh look at that! Oh my gosh it's Sui's sake!

228
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,100
Yeah these are huge right?

229
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,380
Oh and they're kind of see-through! See you can see through them! They're translucent!

230
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:22,260
See they've got the heart! Whoa! Burst!

231
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,980
And taffy! Again I think it's taffy! I don't actually know!

232
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:38,100
Wait it kind of smells nice! It smells like artificial fruit! I don't know!

233
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,020
Do the senpais love artificial fruit? It's that scent!

234
00:36:45,860 --> 00:37:05,860
No! Senpai! Oh no! We're saved! Slightly different! Slightly different! We're saved!

235
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:12,340
Thank you darling visipai!

236
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:22,980
Happy one month! Month of Versa-ry! It's been wonderful so far and I can't wait to see a girl!

237
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,540
Too! I think I need to run down on the pre-cure franchise lore!

238
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:33,620
Right now it sounds like magical furry girls to me! I need to know what the story is actually is!

239
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:42,740
Oh doggie really love owner! Want to be with owner! Become magical girl!

240
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:50,980
Wish granted! Become magical girl! That's it! Saved by the cat! Yeah look how nice this is though!

241
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:58,260
Oh they've got like the jewels! It's so cute! I almost I almost thought I had a dupe because

242
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,380
can you see why I thought it was a dupe? Because it's the same one!

243
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:22,900
It's the same! It's the same pulls! I was like oh my gosh! I get a dupe!

244
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:39,220
I haven't watched pre-cures as Heartcatch! I think the one that I like the most, the latest one,

245
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:52,260
is Hug the Toe! Oh my goodness! Look! This one's so cute! Look! The dog! The dog again! The owner of the dog!

246
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,260
Owner of the dog!

247
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,820
Cute! This one's really cute!

248
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,700
I think this one's really cute! Like look at that! Look she's making a heart!

249
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,700
I can do that too! Yeah!

250
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,220
But yeah they're making hearts! Yeah cute!

251
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:26,340
She has a very cute voice so if you watch the anime I think it's on my crunchy roll.

252
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:31,300
And yeah let's go through all of them! There! Two!

253
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:44,580
Yeah! And this one's her by herself! It's the same art as this one! The same art but like a close-up and the dog version!

254
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,020
Yeah! Pretty cute!

255
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,700
I have so many candy now!

256
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:12,900
I have so many candy now and then I have all these stuff so I'm gonna put them somewhere

257
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:22,660
where they might have a safe home. Next we have whoops! That's a spell!

258
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,780
We have these ones!

259
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,740
So I don't think these come with candy. They're just little acrylic stands so

260
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:43,940
protection spell! Yeah! My friend gave me that so I keep that around with me.

261
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,180
I'm very...

262
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:56,180
So we have these little acrylic stands. I don't think they have candy in them but these are magical doremies!

263
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:02,980
So not Precure but I saw it in stores anyways and they cost me an arm and a leg so

264
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,820
let's see if we get doops!

265
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,180
Yeah!

266
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:23,540
Yeah! I forget what these... I've watched magical doremie a long time ago so I don't remember their names.

267
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:30,180
Anna! Okay so there's Anna and you can see the other side with the little stand hole.

268
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:48,180
What do you do with the duplicates?

269
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:56,180
I give them to friends?

270
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,620
No!

271
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,460
The first dupe!

272
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,620
The first dupe of the day!

273
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,620
Oh! The luck has run out!

274
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:40,180
Beer! Precure blast doremies! Okay! There we go! There's doremies!

275
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:47,620
But we have a dupe! Our first dupe! No!

276
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,060
And then we have this one because this is a little circle.

277
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,700
I haven't watched doremie in a long long time.

278
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:06,260
It's gotcha! God's heard your slander! I'm a very unlucky person anyways.

279
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,100
Oh my god!

280
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:24,420
Oh! Oh! That hurt!

281
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:35,940
Ten pie!

282
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:44,820
Thank you for the 127! Here's some luck! Love you design mercy! I'm new!

283
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,780
I thought you were a kalimbo! No! Not new!

284
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:58,260
We have one more set five! Maybe we can be saved! We have one more!

285
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:25,540
I somehow feel like we did not, we did not get the luck.

286
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,700
But she's very cute!

287
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:35,380
You know what I do because of this!

288
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:43,460
It's safe but like still kind of very similar in color wise right?

289
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,660
Momoko! I remember seeing her.

290
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,580
Still different but like look at these dupes! Oh my gosh!

291
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:02,340
I cost me an arm and a leg! Not gonna lie! These, these cost like

292
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:11,620
five dollars each I think and I bought them because I was like yeah surprise bags and now I feel like

293
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,500
I've been ripped off!

294
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,780
Who's arm and a leg? For one yeah!

295
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,180
The curse of Gacha! Yeah the curse has become!

296
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,300
Do I have anyone that loves Dora and me? I'll just give them like

297
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:41,380
at least all the pre cure ones were good! Yeah!

298
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:52,340
Which one cost five? Yeah! The pre cure ones cost variety of costs!

299
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,140
Thank you boy for the two! You can have my arm and leg!

300
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,180
But we bought gum! Gum gum!

301
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,180
All these taffy things!

302
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:20,980
And all these candies! Toss them into into the cage like like no big deal!

303
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:35,940
Eat it all at once! I can't! Look how much how much of my my um my what do you call it? I still have!

304
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,740
Like my cinnamon roll! I haven't even gone through like a bit of it!

305
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,620
This is a lot of sugars and pie!

306
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:15,620
But yeah! It looks good! Thank you! I'm so sad we got dupes! I also went through that very quickly!

307
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:41,380
How did you manage to find an egg-free cinnamon roll?

308
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:52,660
Um it's a place that specializes! Excuse me some pie! It's too sweet!

309
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,860
It specializes in

310
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:14,900
and um vegan cinnamon rolls! So that's why I was able to get cinnamon rolls without eggs!

311
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:30,820
Thank you for that 333! Call an ass! No you are the cinnamon roll! No you!

312
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:42,660
It would be a problem if I can't eat this because mama and papa they hate sweet and decadent things!

313
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,620
So I would still have to be the one to finish it!

314
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,220
Like I would still have to be the one that finishes it!

315
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,460
And the omeletto turned! There it is!

316
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:09,700
But yeah wow what fatal luck with the with the doré mi stuff huh!

317
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:20,260
Maybe it'll keep for a few days! I bought these a few hours ago and when I say a few hours ago I mean like

318
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:27,460
it's like what eight now?

319
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:44,660
Not eight! Eleven? Oh what! I bought this at like two two p.m.

320
00:49:44,980 --> 00:50:01,060
I'll try to I'll try to eat at least more than more than a nibble!

321
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:20,900
But yeah it's really it's really sweet! This one is blueberries and strawberry with I think

322
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:28,500
strawberry jam and a vanilla frosting with powdered sugar and that's a lot of sugar!

323
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:32,500
Well

324
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:44,900
I don't mind sweet!

325
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,740
But sometimes it's too sweet you know!

326
00:50:51,700 --> 00:51:04,500
Sugar with a side of sugar! But I thought I thought it looked the cutest!

327
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,380
Like you agree right? It looks super cute! You agree that it looks super cute!

328
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:20,180
Why? Why? It's half of you guys! I feel like I've just read like a

329
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,140
a good chunk of you are allergic to strawberries!

330
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,860
It is but it's cool! Hi cute though!

331
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:53,700
Doug! You're looking at me right now! If you demand more than this I'm gonna have to kill you!

332
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:02,020
You see this cake? You see this? This will be you! Okay!

333
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:02,660
Okay!

334
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,140
Understood!

335
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,660
I would die a cinnamon roll!

336
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:33,300
Yes my fork caught it! Understood!

337
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:49,540
If I had a knife with me I would probably start stabbing this!

338
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:55,220
Oh!

339
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:06,740
Look what you made me do! Look what you made me do!

340
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:24,820
I'm not going to ruin my pair of scissors!

341
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:34,580
It stuck right in there! Oh yeah it is! I have to eat around it now!

342
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:40,100
I got a little bit too aggressive! I don't know my own string!

343
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:50,580
But yeah my scissors are too cute for this! Just watch the scissors afterwards! Shut up!

344
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:58,580
You don't understand senpai! Scissors! They have one job and they will always stay to that job!

345
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:04,900
And if you make them do any other job they will dull and they become useless!

346
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:16,580
And I like! I like!

347
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:30,980
How about the scissors in my hair? No these are just decorative!

348
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:37,940
Yeah! Just sharpen them after you wash them? No! Also!

349
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:42,580
Wow!

350
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:51,940
These have only one purpose and they are supposed to be hair accessories!

351
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:59,300
That's it! These scissors in my hair are hair accessories and they will only be!

352
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:08,420
They will only be hair accessories! How do you take them out?

353
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,900
You can use your imagination!

354
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:26,420
I was surprised you weren't good with knives! It was one knife! It was a fruit knife and I cut it

355
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,060
on the dull part! The not sharp part!

356
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:38,900
Oh she really stuck in there!

357
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:55,700
Fork! Fork free! Fork free! I like mangled it! But fork free! Oh look! Would you senpai! Would you?

358
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:11,700
Forbidden! Forbidden! Senpai!

359
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:39,700
What did you do? I unrolled it!

360
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:05,700
Okay good! Management let me know that nothing was caught!

361
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:21,700
Sorry I just unravelled it! I just unravelled it to get the fork out!

362
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,940
Because the fork was really stuck in there senpai!

363
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:30,100
Really stuck in there!

364
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,020
I got icing on my finger!

365
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,660
That's my tissues!

366
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:57,060
Okay it should be good now!

367
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,660
Where did you put the tissues? Underneath the desk!

368
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:19,940
Let us look! No!

369
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,300
Sorry this is very sweet so I'm coughing a little bit from the sweetness!

370
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:31,300
And also choking because I do that!

371
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:39,460
Come on! Almost lost!

372
00:58:44,660 --> 00:59:11,460
I ate another big piece! We're going through it slowly!

373
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:30,100
Have you ever had something so sweet senpai? That you're like cough cough!

374
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:43,140
Can we lick the fork instead? No I just did! Now it has my cooties on it and you can't have it!

375
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:45,380
Senpai!

376
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:54,180

Also Mercy your hands are so small! Really someone said a long time ago that my hands were big

381
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,580
and I feel like my hands are kind of small!

382
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,220
Like I think they're pretty small!

383
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,100

384
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:52,020

385
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,620

386
01:00:55,780 --> 01:01:14,420
Oh no! I got frosting!

387
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:18,580
Frosting on my dress! No!

01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:12,580
Also by the way great mouse!

396
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,540

402
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:16,420

01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,220
stand proportion!

404
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:23,700

01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:32,100
Here look at the buttons again! Yeah buttons!

488
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:44,260
Hand badges whatever you call them yeah!

489
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:56,740
I swear she really does look like Suisei right? She's so she looks like Suisei!

490
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:04,660
I think it's funny that the like regular form of Cure Friendly is named Errol!

491
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:18,660
I'm surprised I didn't get any of the I didn't get her and her like regular form!

492
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:30,660
Yeah!

493
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:41,700
The buttons remind me of making Ita bags for my sister!

494
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:46,580
I was always thinking about making an Ita bag but then I I don't have like

495
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:53,060
a huge fixation that I can justify making one for!

496
01:17:56,740 --> 01:18:17,060
Like seriously this is like oh my gosh! Is it origami time? As soon as I finish this cake I will do the origami!

497
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:33,380
Can you show us your handwriting? Why? Senpai why do you want to see my handwriting?

498
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:35,620
Are you gonna do a forgery?

499
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:43,860
Are you gonna do a forgery? Are you gonna try to forge my handwriting?

500
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:53,300
No no what?

501
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:03,620
No not at all! Would you be proud if we did? I think I would cut off your hands!

502
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:19,300
This tempting is all I would say! I have chicken scratch writing that's all you need to know!

503
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:29,380
That's all you need to know! Come on what do you take us for Kohai? I take you for a bunch of lousy

504
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:30,820
Chicker! Tricksters!

505
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:48,100
Can you write in cursive? I can write in cursive but you're gonna try to forge my signature and that's a big no no!

506
01:19:48,340 --> 01:20:01,780
That's a big no no no! You're such a kidder Senpai!

507
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:12,020
But yeah my defenses are high and you cannot go past my defenses! I learned internet safety back in grade!

508
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:23,460
How many? Wait huh how long ago? That's it!

509
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:33,940
Can we see your sign your name in cursive exactly as it appears in your credit card? No!

510
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:44,740
Don't out yourself! I'm just I'm like how long ago was that?

511
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:54,900
Long time ago and then they assumed for the mercy good food slash drink fund oh thank you

512
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,060
Go for the lead!

513
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:11,460
Internet safety course! I remember! I remember!

514
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:21,540
One time my school made us go on a field trip to the police station so that we can learn about

515
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:26,100
internet safety!

516
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:38,580
I remember that!

517
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:44,980
There's a very interactive display!

518
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:53,060
I think they still use that! A field trip? Yeah a field trip!

519
01:21:53,780 --> 01:22:00,980
Do Senpais not not know what field trips are? Has the education system fallen so far that you

520
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:02,420
can't have field trips anymore?

521
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:15,940
What did they tell you? Never give your real name out on the internet and don't trust anyone on the

522
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:26,500
internet!

523
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:37,540
What's a field trip? Oh come on! You're just we're just pulling my leg now Senpai!

524
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,380
You're just pulling my leg now!

525
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:50,900
I was taken to a prison for a field trip! Oh my gosh!

526
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:59,540
Why did they take you to a prison?

527
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,260
Wait why did they take you to a prison?

528
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:13,380
Like when I went to the police station it was like here's an interactive

529
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:21,940
um display about internet safety and the the dangers of drunk driving!

530
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:37,300
Can we take a field trip out of the house? You can take a field trip passed out!

531
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:49,620
The police station field trip all we looked at were holding cells!

532
01:23:54,740 --> 01:24:00,260
Leadership program huh? They're like we can't afford anything let's go to prison!

533
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:15,940
You take pictures while we're knocked out right? Yeah! Your field trip is your dreams

534
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:23,780
and you can explore all you want and then you get waken up again and you're on a operating table

535
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:27,940
and there's a chainsaw about to cat open your limbs!

536
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:35,460
Fun! Fun for the whole family! Great trip!

537
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:57,540
I didn't need that kidney anyways! How much do human how much do body parts go for?

538
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:02,900
Uh you know no reason! Out of curiosity!

539
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:16,580
They're asking for a friend! Yeah just like how Senpai's always asked for a friend!

540
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:22,820
Senpai!

541
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:23,540
Senpai!

542
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:31,940
Thank you for the 499 Tupacab Rally Legend 99!

543
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:38,340
I have no clue why but my teacher said I was gonna end up there so proven I'm wrong about the prison!

544
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:42,420
Why is your teacher so mean to you?

545
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:47,140
Skinnies go for 100k to 200k!

546
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:50,980
A human heart can go for more right?

547
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:00,180
Skin 10 dollars per inch! Look!

548
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:08,340
Now you have to re-senpai when you say you're worthless you're actually worth so much!

549
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:12,260
Look at that! 1,500 per eye!

550
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:46,260
A heart goes for 500k to 1 mil! It's okay!

551
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:52,980
Gives cold eye my heart only for her to give it away!

552
01:26:54,180 --> 01:27:00,260
It's for a good cause! For a good cause! You're volunteering!

553
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:17,940
Volunteering! It's a good civil civic duty? I don't know what those are called right?

554
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:21,860
But the heart is only for you! Okay!

555
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:32,260
Just like signing up for a donation when you die!

556
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:42,100
I'll keep them nice and preserved!

557
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:45,220
Nice and preserved!

558
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:56,260
I'll only sell off the bad senpais! The ones that are fake! Senpai! Senpai!

559
01:27:57,140 --> 01:28:08,340
Thank you Anon for the dollar! An internet safety class I never I learned to never send

560
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:11,940
money to strange ladies on the internet! Definitely funk back class!

561
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:17,140
Are you calling me strange senpai? Are you calling me strange?

562
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:22,740
Oh you're right! But shut up!

563
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:28,020
You're right! But shut up!

564
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:40,900
Honestly! How rude! I think they taught you some manners too!

565
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:50,020
Your cage is going to be a bird cage now! Start squawking!

566
01:28:56,980 --> 01:29:08,500
Speaking of! I went to the pet store today! I got senpai's stuff!

567
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:14,020
It's a surprise!

568
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:27,540
Hehe! What stuff I want to see? You have to wait for your surprise!

569
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:39,140
We have new collars? Unfortunately not new collars!

570
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:51,940
New ping pong paddles! Do they sell that at pet stores?

571
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:55,540
When is it the surprise? Next week!

572
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:59,060
Next week!

573
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:12,660
Next week! And you, you'll see! You'll see! Don't worry!

574
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:18,260
I can't wait that long! What? Too fricking bad! Hi! Patience is a virtue!

575
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:28,260
Haha!

576
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,260
New water bowl! Yes sir!

577
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:52,660
I don't think I can make it that long without a heart! You already took it out! I wasn't ready!

578
01:30:56,260 --> 01:31:05,780
Haha! I wasn't ready! I don't have, I don't have the, the, the body transport thing yet!

579
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:12,820
Wait, we had water? I always leave you guys water and like a food bowl!

580
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:21,540
I also change the water every day!

581
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:31,300
Aren't, aren't I such a nice girlfriend?

582
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:43,300
Neen water! Food!

583
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:51,620
You even get to keep your bionicles! It's great! It's great in the basement!

584
01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:04,660
Haha! A cage over your heads! Hammers! What more could you want?

585
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:17,380
Is it filtered water or tap water? Um, filtered?

586
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:24,020
Haha! Just comfy!

587
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:30,900
Can I get a cat fountain? I like my water with the illusion of freshness!

588
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:34,180
That's kind of expensive! We're gonna have to like...

589
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:45,940
Can we wage war against the neighbor's basement? No! I like my neighbors sort of!

590
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:55,860
Cage larger than a New York, New York City apartment! How small is it in New York?

591
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:58,340
Wait, is it as small as the Japanese ones?

592
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,060
Probably!

593
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:09,060
Ah!

594
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:14,740
Smaller, seriously?

595
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:24,900
Is it coffin rooms? Not even like... Okay, I've seen like the...

596
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:26,740
What do you call it?

597
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:32,660
Capsule hotels and then some of those capsule hotels were converted into like kind of miniature homes.

598
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:39,060
Haha!

599
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:52,500
Nightmare in actual apartments in the mini apartments!

600
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:56,420
Wow! Okay!

601
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:03,780
So what I'm hearing is it's terrible!

602
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:13,780
I hear New York has good food, though! Does that make up for the size?

603
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:27,780
Does it taste really worth it? Absolutely not!

604
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:33,540
No, no, no! New York has big city rats!

605
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,460
Wait, inflation?

606
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:45,140
Sorry, wrong inflation!

607
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:48,100
Price inflation! Wow!

608
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:24,100
He's joke!

609
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:36,100
Okay, I need some water now! I laughed too hard on my own joke!

610
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:55,860
Also, it's like a bite left, Senpai! Look, just a bite left!

611
01:35:57,620 --> 01:36:02,100
I eat so slowly! I'm so sorry! I eat so slowly! It's because I'm yapping!

612
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:06,660
I'm yapping! I'm yapping while I'm eating!

613
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:09,380
For us?

614
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:31,300
I'm surprised you can eat something that sweet! It's slowly, but I'm doing it!

615
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:40,420
Ah, open wide! Here comes the choo choo train!

616
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:43,540
Chaka chaka chaka chaka choo choo!

617
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:01,540
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore!

618
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:25,540
You didn't waste the last bite with anything, did you? Nothing but love!

619
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:26,660
Haha!

620
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:40,420
Regretting your life choices? I don't regret anything!

621
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:46,500
Except for that one thing, and that other thing, and that other thing, and that one other thing,

622
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:53,300
and the thing I did yesterday, and the thing I did last week.

623
01:37:55,540 --> 01:38:00,900
Other than that, I regret nothing! What is love a euphemism for?

624
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:06,180
Use your imagination, Senpai!

625
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:18,260
Welcome, Raiders!

626
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:24,900

01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:29,940

01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:44,420
Hello, my name is Mercy Maldives from Via Lore's Indul- First Gen Indulged!

630
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:50,420
I am your- your dorky yandere! Welcome to my basement!

631
01:38:52,980 --> 01:39:01,700
We're celebrating our one-month celebration today. I'm in the middle of eating um my

632
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:09,620
cinnamon roll, and I finished opening my stuff. I'm pretty cute, merch stuff!

633
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:23,540
And like some more pretty cute blind bag stuff that we we got. These are really cute!

634
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:38,340
And I'm doing a hand cam. Oh my gosh, see? I already got like frosting on my- on my- on my- on my- on my gloves.

635
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:42,580
Well, welcome, welcome, welcome! How was your stream?

636
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:49,620
Sorry, I'm coughing so much. The cinnamon roll is very-

637
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:53,300
Very, very, very sweet.

638
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:08,660
Thank you B-Dest for the 199 Super Chat Pre-Cure Merch needs more cowbell. I don't have a cowbell.

639
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:20,340
Good, I suffered through bloodborne for six hours. Six hours! Wow, you are a

640
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:25,460
endurance streamer! Almost as- endurance as-

641
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:30,420
Fraune! Who's also a gen main of mine who's streamed for long hours?

642
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:37,140
Wow!

643
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:46,900
Drone cowbell fun when? I actually went to a store and I saw a cowbell and then I said,

644
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:54,260
huh, should I pick one of those up for like ASMR streams? And then I rang and I was like,

645
01:40:54,260 --> 01:40:56,740
I don't think this is a very pleasant sound.

646
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:04,580
I don't think this is a very pleasant sound for like anyone to listen to.

647
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:16,500
It'll be like, dong dong dong dong dong dong dong. But I had the chance.

648
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:21,940
I had the chance to get one.

649
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:29,860
One hour cowbell.

650
01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:34,980
You're a mancy.

651
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:48,980
But I got some other things for ASMR-er.

652
01:41:49,460 --> 01:41:58,820
I went around for like a while trying to find some nice ASMR stuff and then I would like put it to

653
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:03,620
my ear and then sometimes the staff's like, oh, can I help you with anything? Oh, why are you looking

654
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:10,500
for your things that make nice sounds? And I was like, uh, uh, I'm a- I'm a Foley artist. I'm a Foley

655
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:13,700
artist. I'm recording sound. Yeah.

656
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:25,060
I hate it when they ask questions.

657
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:31,060
I'm audio engineer.

658
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:39,220
Yeah, I'm a Foley artist, you know, like when they record like sound effects. Yeah.

659
01:42:41,300 --> 01:42:49,620
I'm a farmer.

660
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:56,180
Should I plug your Patreon? No. Wait, I should plug my Patreon though.

661
01:42:58,180 --> 01:42:59,220
After I finish this.

662
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:14,180
This is safe for work. I had this. Hold on. Actually, I can do it now.

663
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:26,340
This is my, my safe for work stream.

664
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:30,500
Patreon schedule.

665
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:39,860
The mini golf. Three whole mini golf. First one.

666
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:49,220
We're tied up with one hand free. Wow. Questioning wiper fluid choices.

667
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:54,340
And rearranging tables with me.

668
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:12,340
Please be 18 plus.

669
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:26,420
These tables aren't going to table themselves. Oh boy.

670
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:32,340
Mini golf. You get there. Wait, this isn't mini golf.

671
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:39,860
No worries. My chat that came in here are all 18 and other.

672
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:42,980
Good.

673
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:56,260
Good. In case you know, in case you know, if you do know how wink, wait,

674
01:44:57,300 --> 01:45:01,540
I'm winking, but I have an eye patch on. So it looks like I'm blinking.

675
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:14,660
If, if you are, if you don't know, Teehee.

676
01:45:15,060 --> 01:45:17,780
Oh.

677
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:29,780
Play mini golf. Oh.

678
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:38,740
Eye patch is perfect cover for not being able to wink. I can wink.

679
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:41,780
I just choose not to take off my eye patch.

680
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:51,220
You can still play mini golf after probably. I love cheating and golf though.

681
01:45:56,100 --> 01:46:02,660
I love cheating and golf. Nobody's watching. Kick the ball in.

682
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:13,060
Oh, look over there. Smash him with the club.

683
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:25,220
She loves cheating. It's over. Why are you making up some pie? I just said in mini golf.

684
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:35,620
Golf with friends would be so fun though. Look over there.

685
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:47,780
He's into NTR. NTR, NTR this, NTR that. Wow. Everyone's so obsessed with NTR.

686
01:46:55,940 --> 01:47:08,740
Thank you for the five second. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yacht club. Wow. I couldn't even

687
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:17,780
read for a second. I guess my favorite VTuber mercenary modesty. What the heck?

688
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:33,780
Where is he? Modest. Modest nuts.

689
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:53,540
Yandere for hire. I come in with my cinnamon roll scissors and

690
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:58,500
attack my target.

691
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:12,740
Oh my gosh. I haven't even finished this fight.

692
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:21,940
She made it there. Scissors for cinnamon roll. The character. The character's in my roll.

693
01:48:23,460 --> 01:48:24,900
Look at that. Cute.

694
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:40,420
Cute. I also don't like how this auto color balance is dying on me.

695
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:45,460
It won't show you the goods. It's like turning so dark.

696
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:52,340
I like, I like, I generally like anything cute.

697
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:58,100
Camera's so wacky. I haven't set this up in a long time.

698
01:48:58,660 --> 01:49:11,940
I feel like my favorite character, if I had to go for Sanrio, is like Pom Pom Pudding.

699
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:22,660
Look, it's so dark now. See? It's like, oh, I need to balance with, why are you like this?

700
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:37,140
No. Probably need something dark to like, balance it out.

701
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:53,860
Ah, that's better. Oh, it's, it is, it's having a nightmare though.

702
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:59,940
Oh, professional streamer, Mercy Modees.

703
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:07,220
Turn on the lights. It is on. It is on.

704
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:17,780
See? If I do this. Oh, you can see frosting on my glove. Anyway, if I do this, this is the regular light.

705
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:22,660
This is the regular light.

706
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:36,900
And if I move away, it suddenly gets darker for some reason. I guess it's trying to,

707
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:40,820
wait, hold on, let me check my, my web. Oh, I see.

708
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:47,380
The, no, go back, go back, go back. All the exposure is messed.

709
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:50,260
Stay, stay.

710
01:50:55,620 --> 01:50:56,260
No.

711
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:14,020
Yeah, the camera only wants to see my hands.

712
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:23,380
The camera only, only wants to see my hands. It only has eyes for me.

713
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:31,940
Usually it doesn't get like this, but I'm spending finicky today.

714
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:42,900
Keep my hand on the table.

715
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:59,220
Never mind. I need, I need my other. I need this hand to eat.

716
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:05,780
I just want to focus on me, Mercy Modees.

717
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:13,780
I think it's dimming because of the reflections from the ceiling light.

718
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:20,180
You can, you can see the, the kind of like my lights. Actually, this is the camera.

719
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:25,460
It might be too bright. Hold on.

720
01:52:29,940 --> 01:52:36,500
Thank you, Bethes for the 199 Supercat.

721
01:52:37,940 --> 01:52:46,260
My camera seems handy. Yeah, hold on, let me adjust some stuff. Maybe it will

722
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:52,980
adjust the lighting and the temperature.

723
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:57,780
Now let's do cool temperature.

724
01:53:02,020 --> 01:53:07,300
Maybe it will work more. There, lights have been dimmed.

725
01:53:08,260 --> 01:53:20,420
There you go. Look, look at me, Senpai. I just adjusted the lights.

726
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:26,340
This is how much work I put into a stream sometimes.

727
01:53:38,020 --> 01:53:46,660
Slightly brighter. Yeah. Otherwise, if I go any lower, it's just gonna be like

728
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:51,780
pretty much nothing, but hey, yellow light.

729
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:58,100
Maybe I can cool it down even. Nah, doesn't make a difference.

730
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:11,700
I see it's so, it's such a yellow light, otherwise.

731
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:16,340
There they are.

732
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:24,100
Woo! Thank you, Senpai, for the fix.

733
01:54:28,740 --> 01:54:29,460
Pretty cute.

734
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:36,500
Let's get this one out. It's cuter.

735
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:40,420
Yeah, cuter.

736
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:48,820
It's actually darker. The camera just makes it look brighter.

737
01:54:59,700 --> 01:55:04,340
Thanks for the $4.99. This is her super chat. Well, then I'm not gonna read the rest.

738
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:18,100
Boom.

739
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:29,060
Am I okay? This, this cake, it's very sweet. And because it's so sweet, I'm coughing because

740
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:40,180
I'm choking on it.

741
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:52,180
Sorry about coughing a lot, though.

742
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:08,820
Oh, there's a little bit more, Senpai.

743
01:56:13,220 --> 01:56:21,460
It's very sweet. It's like, it's vanilla frosting with strawberries, blueberries,

744
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:27,220
and powdered sugar. I think the powdered sugar

745
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:42,580
makes it too sweet.

746
01:56:51,700 --> 01:56:58,580
It's done!

747
01:57:02,980 --> 01:57:04,580
It's done! I'm free!

748
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:14,580
It took forever, but I did it.

749
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:28,500
Okay, let me go through my child stuff. And maybe we can finally do the cake origami.

750
01:57:29,380 --> 01:57:31,300
Let me just move all these guys over.

751
01:57:32,260 --> 01:57:37,940
Sorry about the delay. I was like, yeah, cake!

752
01:57:51,380 --> 01:57:53,380
It was one of those things, you know?

753
01:57:53,620 --> 01:57:57,860
There we go.

754
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:14,420
The duality of cake. So we have kind of like a little folding book. Oh, there's like tons of them.

755
01:58:16,580 --> 01:58:22,260
That's nice. There's like lots of them. Now the issue is, are there instructions?

756
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:34,260
Because I might have to just, you know, oh, instructions?

757
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:50,260
I should have seen this coming that it was in Japanese!

758
01:58:54,340 --> 01:59:10,340
Oh, I should have figured this out. I did say I would fail at this.

759
01:59:12,740 --> 01:59:20,740
Okay, so let's start with this cake. I'm pretty sure there should be other

760
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:30,580
pieces too. Yes, yes, I see some. Assism! Then we have strawberry.

761
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:39,860
Thank goodness for pictures. Where would I be without them? Probably nowhere.

762
01:59:42,180 --> 01:59:49,220
Okay, I think that's all I need. See, I have like frosting on here.

763
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:56,260
Okay, instructions.

764
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:12,820
Hope it's pretty easy to make. Well, I'm going to follow the instructions with the scissors,

765
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:13,620
and I'm going to cut them.

766
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:19,780
I'm using the camera.

767
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:37,300
Okay, just like gunpla, except for worse, maybe?

768
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:57,300
Hmm.

769
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:05,300
Hmm.

770
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:16,180
Paper. Scissors! Rock!

771
02:01:26,820 --> 02:01:39,300
Which way is the direction?

772
02:01:40,180 --> 02:01:52,660
Scissors? Cut, cut, cut. Cut, cut, cut. I said I would fail at this.

773
02:01:53,940 --> 02:01:59,220
I bought it and I was like, oh, this, oh, this one's cheaper. I wonder why it's cheaper.

774
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:04,980
I should have figured that it was because it was harder.

775
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:20,500
Okay, here is the strawberry. Okay.

776
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:27,300
We'll see the instructions for the strawberries. Okay, hold it like this.

777
02:02:28,980 --> 02:02:30,980
Hold it like this.

778
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:49,620
Hold it over here. Okay. Okay, okay, we got this. Probably.

779
02:02:53,460 --> 02:02:59,220
This would make a good ASMR stream. You're in luck, this is the ASMR stream.

780
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:07,700
Okay, okay, I think I know what they're saying. Yes, yes, okay.

781
02:03:08,980 --> 02:03:13,620
Hold it like this. I'm on this instruction over here that you cannot see this one.

782
02:03:19,220 --> 02:03:25,700
This one goes over here. This one goes the same way, I'm assuming.

783
02:03:26,580 --> 02:03:34,180
And then you can have a triangle. Yeah.

784
02:03:37,540 --> 02:03:44,580
I think, yeah. Wow, I am not dexterous at all. Yeah.

785
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:50,820
Yeah. Okay.

786
02:03:55,380 --> 02:04:01,620
What does this mean? Okay, so it's asking me, hold it.

787
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:05,620
Like what?

788
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:12,020
Oh, I see it now. I see it now.

789
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:21,060
And then we fold it this way. Yeah.

790
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:26,740
So we're on this instruction now, and then we're probably going to go on the same

791
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:37,220
thing for the other side. Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

792
02:04:37,220 --> 02:04:43,220
It's not the best, but I got it.

793
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:52,260
Okay, let's see what else they got. I'm on.

794
02:04:57,540 --> 02:04:57,860
Nine.

795
02:05:02,740 --> 02:05:03,060
Yeah.

796
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:18,180
And then the other side. Same thing, I think.

797
02:05:24,820 --> 02:05:30,100
Wait, I think, oh, this is hard with bandaged hands.

798
02:05:30,340 --> 02:05:41,620
Can I read it? Oh, I can read it, but I don't know the words.

799
02:05:45,700 --> 02:05:46,980
I think.

800
02:05:46,980 --> 02:06:05,380
Oh, that's crunchy looking. I played myself a little bit with the band-aids.

801
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:13,540
Yeah. I really wanted to impress my senpais and be like, hey, look at me. I'm cosplaying myself.

802
02:06:13,540 --> 02:06:14,260
Yeah.

803
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:23,460
I'm a bit of a fool. Admittingly, I'm a bit of a fool for that.

804
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:35,620
Oh my gosh. What does this mean? Give me a second.

805
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:55,620
Am I still here? It said OBS disconnected.

806
02:07:02,420 --> 02:07:11,620
Welcome back. Okay, it buffered. Okay, it did some funky thing. Yeah, we're here again.

807
02:07:13,540 --> 02:07:19,140
Wow. Okay.

808
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:25,780
Instructions a little hard when it's just pictures.

809
02:07:31,460 --> 02:07:33,620
When it's just pictures, it's a little hard.

810
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:41,220
I think I somehow have it.

811
02:07:44,500 --> 02:07:55,220
Oh, tucking it in is really hard. Tucking it in is really hard. Look at that. Look at that fold.

812
02:07:56,100 --> 02:08:03,220
Isn't it neat? Don't you think that my collection is complete?

813
02:08:03,220 --> 02:08:10,900
Don't you say I'm a girl? Girl to hands? Everything!

814
02:08:13,700 --> 02:08:14,900
Ah, shit, I un-tucked it.

815
02:08:21,780 --> 02:08:26,100
Get in there. Yeah. Yeah, look at that.

816
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:30,420
Great fold.

817
02:08:34,180 --> 02:08:34,740
This one.

818
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:42,820
And then this one as well. Then they fold.

819
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:46,420
They fold in.

820
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:55,780
Yeah, fold in here.

821
02:08:55,860 --> 02:08:59,860
Come on.

822
02:09:03,700 --> 02:09:06,340
Give me a second. I'm over here.

823
02:09:15,540 --> 02:09:20,580
Give me a second. I'm trying to fix. I'm trying to tuck it into the slit.

824
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:27,780
I'm trying to tuck it into the slit. It's not wanting to tuck. It's way in.

825
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:34,740
The dexterity. I don't have it.

826
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:46,900
This is what happens when your fingers are bandaged.

827
02:09:47,220 --> 02:09:56,100
Your fingers are bandaged and you thought this was a great idea because you wanted to impress your

828
02:09:56,100 --> 02:10:01,620
senpai's. But here it is. I cannot tuck.

829
02:10:05,940 --> 02:10:10,420
This is where it falters and suffers for the art.

830
02:10:16,900 --> 02:10:30,980
Where they are, I tucked one side and I was very proud of it but now this side won't tuck.

831
02:10:36,820 --> 02:10:38,500
It's tough being an artiste.

832
02:10:39,460 --> 02:10:49,460
And then as I can see here is that I can, once it tucks, I can push the bottom

833
02:10:50,740 --> 02:10:57,620
a bit and then it makes it a strawberry and I'm just like,

834
02:10:58,100 --> 02:11:00,980
oh, shit.

835
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:14,100
I am not the queen of tuck. I have found out I am not the queen of tuck.

836
02:11:14,980 --> 02:11:21,380
Right now the tucking game is not there. It is weak. It is gone. It is...

837
02:11:27,860 --> 02:11:31,380
Yeah.

838
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:41,700
Why was it easy to tuck on the other side but not this side?

839
02:11:46,420 --> 02:11:49,380
Any of my scissors? Do I need my scissors to be like, get in there?

840
02:11:57,620 --> 02:12:01,380
I need a pot that I'm more expensive on.

841
02:12:28,580 --> 02:12:33,380
Well, it's sort of a strawberry.

842
02:12:33,380 --> 02:12:57,140
I don't think this is real. I don't think this is real.

843
02:12:57,860 --> 02:13:05,700
You can see the pattern on it so it's supposed to puff out at the sides

844
02:13:05,700 --> 02:13:18,900
if I could have tucked it in and then stands up like that. So I applied.

845
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:44,900
I tried and I failed. Oh, I found some. Okay, hold on.

846
02:13:46,820 --> 02:13:52,980
Which way is it floating? Okay, okay, I see something. I see something. I see some more

847
02:13:53,060 --> 02:14:04,100
instructions. Fold this side. Yeah. Then we fold this side over.

848
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:16,740
This is the cake. This is the brown part of cake. Triangular part of cake. Yeah.

849
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:26,740
The slice part. Yeah.

850
02:14:32,500 --> 02:14:32,740
Hold on.

851
02:14:44,100 --> 02:14:44,740
Instructions.

852
02:14:45,700 --> 02:14:52,900
There are two of them that I'm supposed to do.

853
02:14:57,380 --> 02:14:59,300
Oh yeah, there is two of them I'm supposed to do.

854
02:15:02,020 --> 02:15:02,900
Okay, hold on.

855
02:15:05,540 --> 02:15:05,940
Okay.

856
02:15:06,580 --> 02:15:11,540
Fold this one. Then we fold this one the same way.

857
02:15:15,780 --> 02:15:18,580
Fold one side down.

858
02:15:20,580 --> 02:15:29,380
Other side also down. Wow, paper hard. I used to do like origami as a kid. I was so good at it.

859
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:36,180
And now look at me. Terrible at it.

860
02:15:38,180 --> 02:15:50,820
And it says here to slide this vision around this part.

861
02:16:00,340 --> 02:16:12,260
I don't think I did this right. I think this is the other way around. I think it's the other way

862
02:16:12,260 --> 02:16:25,060
around. I think this is supposed to be in here. And then this part is supposed to be folded over

863
02:16:25,060 --> 02:16:27,860
like this. Yeah.

864
02:16:31,620 --> 02:16:37,460
And this part is supposed to fold over like this.

865
02:16:39,540 --> 02:16:39,940
And then

866
02:16:43,380 --> 02:16:49,860
it's supposed to. Oh, I see it now. I see it now, Senpai.

867
02:16:55,060 --> 02:16:59,940
I think you're supposed to slip it in here. It's supposed to slip in here.

868
02:17:03,140 --> 02:17:10,100
Look, look the triangle part. It's popping out, but it's fine.

869
02:17:16,020 --> 02:17:22,020
Yeah, let's go. We got it. Cake piece.

870
02:17:25,380 --> 02:17:27,220
I understood the assignment.

871
02:17:30,820 --> 02:17:36,020
Now I need a white sheet now because we got a bunch of those.

872
02:17:44,500 --> 02:17:50,020
Yeah, we need this sheet now. This one says to fold it in half.

873
02:17:55,780 --> 02:18:01,140
That's not a very good half, but you.

874
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:04,980
And then

875
02:18:05,060 --> 02:18:16,820
and I think

876
02:18:25,940 --> 02:18:28,820
Sorry, give me a second Senpai. I'm kind of dumb.

877
02:18:29,460 --> 02:18:36,980
Okay, I think I open it again and fold it

878
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:40,340
this way.

879
02:18:42,980 --> 02:18:46,900
Okay, fold it this way.

880
02:18:50,820 --> 02:18:54,900
And then we fold it this way again.

881
02:18:59,540 --> 02:19:01,860
And then it looks like it's telling me to unfold it again

882
02:19:03,780 --> 02:19:08,660
and do it smaller scale. Okay, let's see how this works.

883
02:19:19,460 --> 02:19:20,580
And then fold it like this.

884
02:19:23,140 --> 02:19:24,020
Oh, paper.

885
02:19:29,380 --> 02:19:32,180
If only I was more dexterous.

886
02:19:34,340 --> 02:19:36,020
If only I was more dexterous.

887
02:19:38,660 --> 02:19:47,460
Then I could totally make this look better, but as far as Senpais know, I'm still pretty clumsy.

888
02:19:47,460 --> 02:20:06,100
Okay, now it's telling me to take this part and fold it like this. Okay.

889
02:20:17,460 --> 02:20:27,380
No, that's wrong. I think. No, that's right. That's right. I'm just being weird.

890
02:20:28,900 --> 02:20:29,940
And then fold this

891
02:20:33,620 --> 02:20:34,100
this way.

892
02:20:40,340 --> 02:20:41,220
And fold this

893
02:20:41,940 --> 02:20:45,940
this way.

894
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:57,940
And then fold it. Okay. Okay, confuse. This way.

895
02:21:06,820 --> 02:21:07,940
I think that's too big.

896
02:21:11,300 --> 02:21:13,700
I think that's too big, but it's supposed to like...

897
02:21:15,860 --> 02:21:16,580
Wait, hold on.

898
02:21:24,980 --> 02:21:27,620
Okay, so I folded it

899
02:21:32,660 --> 02:21:33,220
this way.

900
02:21:36,660 --> 02:21:39,460
Yes, and I folded it.

901
02:21:42,100 --> 02:21:45,300
Then we fold it

902
02:21:46,980 --> 02:21:52,180
this way. Oh, okay. I see it. I see it now. I see it now.

903
02:21:53,220 --> 02:21:57,540
Then we fold it this way. Huh. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

904
02:22:00,260 --> 02:22:02,100
And then I think Senpai.

905
02:22:06,660 --> 02:22:07,700
Then we got it this way.

906
02:22:08,420 --> 02:22:13,220
Thank you for the five, Charlie Spur.

907
02:22:13,220 --> 02:22:17,380
Kolei, stop hurting your hands, but the scissors down. That's what it looks like. I'm holding scissors.

908
02:22:27,060 --> 02:22:36,420
Oh my gosh, I got it. I think I got it. Oh, Senpai.

909
02:22:37,700 --> 02:22:44,420
I think I got it. It's not the greatest looking thing, but I think I got it.

910
02:23:08,660 --> 02:23:22,500
I just need to figure out what they did for this last part because now I'm confused.

911
02:23:23,860 --> 02:23:28,980
This part with the eight right here, I'm like, okay, now what did you do?

912
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:38,500
There's my, there's my first piece of the cake. There's my really shitty strawberry that I couldn't

913
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:55,940
talk. So like, what did they do?

914
02:23:55,940 --> 02:24:04,980
What did they do? I think they did this.

915
02:24:12,900 --> 02:24:21,380
I think that's what they did. They like folded this part in.

916
02:24:26,260 --> 02:24:35,860
But then it doesn't fit here unless

917
02:24:39,220 --> 02:24:44,900
it doesn't fit here. It's supposed to like fell on top. I'm like, wait, this is too big.

918
02:24:44,900 --> 02:24:50,420
Was I supposed to make a smaller? Was I supposed to make a smaller one? And then it just,

919
02:24:51,220 --> 02:24:59,780
wait, was there like other smaller ones? Hold on. Did I get the wrong paper?

920
02:25:07,860 --> 02:25:09,460
Was I supposed to cut it smaller?

921
02:25:09,700 --> 02:25:25,380
When I said I would fail, I meant it.

922
02:25:26,340 --> 02:25:39,860
I'm supposed to go up here. I think I was supposed to cut it smaller.

923
02:25:41,780 --> 02:25:46,580
Oh boy. I think I was supposed to cut it smaller and then I was supposed to slide in.

924
02:25:50,660 --> 02:25:55,060
I was supposed to slide in because you can kind of see where the folds were supposed to go

925
02:25:55,060 --> 02:26:07,140
in order to go into here. And then after that you get like the strawberry on top.

926
02:26:07,140 --> 02:26:19,220
And then I...

927
02:26:26,500 --> 02:26:30,660
We can still work with this. We can still work with this. This can still be saved, I think.

928
02:26:31,540 --> 02:26:32,740
Give me a second, Senpai.

929
02:26:35,860 --> 02:26:39,380
This can still be saved. This can still be saved.

930
02:26:42,260 --> 02:26:47,300
It's just a cake with a lot of frosting. This can still be saved. I'm going to pretend

931
02:26:48,260 --> 02:26:54,420
that I didn't mess up and we're going to force our way in. We're going to force our way in.

932
02:26:56,980 --> 02:26:58,260
We're going to force it.

933
02:27:00,660 --> 02:27:05,700
Ta-da! Just shove it in there!

934
02:27:21,860 --> 02:27:23,220
And then the strawberry cake.

935
02:27:31,620 --> 02:27:39,220
Look! It's a strawberry cake! Yeah! Great job, me!

936
02:27:39,220 --> 02:28:02,740
Wow, it looks so tan. Oh, there it is. There's my...

937
02:28:03,300 --> 02:28:11,700
But yeah, it was supposed to like be flat here and then it was supposed to sit on top.

938
02:28:14,260 --> 02:28:23,060
It was saved! Barely. Oh, I broke it. It was saved! And then it wasn't saved.

939
02:28:23,620 --> 02:28:25,860
Wait, I got this. I got this. I can fix this.

940
02:28:35,700 --> 02:28:41,380
Our cake! No! No, Senpai! I gotta make my Senpai happy! Get in there!

941
02:28:46,980 --> 02:28:47,780
Don't worry, it's just...

942
02:28:48,660 --> 02:29:00,820
Yeah, I don't have tape. I'm sorry, I don't have a tape. But we did it!

943
02:29:03,460 --> 02:29:06,820
Delicious for Senpai, especially from me!

944
02:29:11,380 --> 02:29:14,660
Here, hold on. I'll turn it to the side. It'll look kind of cuter.

945
02:29:18,500 --> 02:29:24,180
It's sort of cute.

946
02:29:38,340 --> 02:29:41,300
It looks great from above, sort of.

947
02:29:41,300 --> 02:29:48,340
Don't look at the sides. Don't look behind it. Don't look at anywhere else.

948
02:29:52,180 --> 02:29:53,300
I forced it in.

949
02:29:58,260 --> 02:30:04,900
It's scuffed with the love, with my love. It's fine. Look at that cake.

950
02:30:05,300 --> 02:30:11,620
The strawberry fell off. It's okay. Okay.

951
02:30:13,700 --> 02:30:22,500
The cake! Your wonderful cake! Oh, my love! Yeah!

952
02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:34,420
Oh, gosh. They're teaching me more ways to make other cakes.

953
02:30:37,380 --> 02:30:37,700
Bro.

954
02:30:43,300 --> 02:30:44,740
Yeah, I did it!

955
02:30:44,820 --> 02:30:49,620
It was forced in.

956
02:30:54,100 --> 02:30:55,300
We'll get this next time.

957
02:30:58,340 --> 02:31:00,420
Look, I can make so many strawberries!

958
02:31:05,540 --> 02:31:09,140
That's amazing! Look at that! Oh, fuck.

959
02:31:09,940 --> 02:31:14,340
Yeah, that's amazing! Look at that! Perfect!

960
02:31:17,300 --> 02:31:22,420
It'll be on like a cute little plate and everything. And you can have the strawberry.

961
02:31:22,420 --> 02:31:25,060
You can have the best part. The strawberry, Senpai.

962
02:31:26,260 --> 02:31:31,380
Have the best part. The part that... Actually, that's not a good looking part here.

963
02:31:31,380 --> 02:31:33,780
Yeah, this part looks better. No, it looks...

964
02:31:39,940 --> 02:31:46,500
Yeah! Fantastic!

965
02:31:49,540 --> 02:31:58,500
Praise me! Praise me! Look at this cake that I made for you with love and paper!

966
02:32:09,540 --> 02:32:11,140
Origami is not for me.

967
02:32:16,420 --> 02:32:25,460
This is not a hobby that I particularly find stimulating.

968
02:32:31,220 --> 02:32:36,260
It's our cake. Since you didn't have any cake, you can have this paper cake.

969
02:32:37,220 --> 02:32:42,580
But if you close your eyes and maybe... Maybe if you narrow your eyes and blur a little bit,

970
02:32:42,580 --> 02:32:43,780
it looks like a real cake.

971
02:32:54,180 --> 02:32:54,740
Oh, boy.

972
02:32:55,060 --> 02:33:05,540
It is blurry enough. There.

973
02:33:13,460 --> 02:33:15,860
Just add some sugar and there you go!

974
02:33:24,980 --> 02:33:35,620
It is very cake. Uh, yeah. Great. Delicious.

975
02:33:35,620 --> 02:33:40,260
Happy one-month anniversary, Kui. Looking forward to many more.

976
02:33:40,260 --> 02:33:43,380
I hope this is enough to cover for the lovely cake you made.

977
02:33:43,780 --> 02:33:48,980
Thank you, Senpai, for the hundred!

978
02:33:52,660 --> 02:33:59,540
It is more than enough. It is more than enough for the cake that I just made.

979
02:34:00,660 --> 02:34:04,900
Thank you. Senpai's up. It's so kind to me.

980
02:34:05,220 --> 02:34:15,780
I would feed it, but it's falling apart. There. It's so cake. Don't look underneath.

981
02:34:18,660 --> 02:34:19,540
It's so cake.

982
02:34:22,420 --> 02:34:26,420
You know, like I needed glue or something to make it like, oh, boom, cake.

983
02:34:28,740 --> 02:34:32,340
Yeah, great stuff. Peace, peace, peace, peace, peace.

984
02:34:33,220 --> 02:34:35,060
Boneless!

985
02:34:39,620 --> 02:34:41,780
I asked for that cake. Boneless!

986
02:34:48,900 --> 02:34:54,900
Oh, my gosh. When I was a kid, I loved folding paper because, um, wow.

987
02:34:55,700 --> 02:34:58,980
You know what? I'm going to use Trauma Dump on you, Senpai.

988
02:34:58,980 --> 02:35:03,060
When I was a kid, uh, for the longest time, I could not afford...

989
02:35:05,460 --> 02:35:10,020
I could not afford Barbies. So we had paper dolls.

990
02:35:12,420 --> 02:35:15,060
And I would cut out our puncture.

991
02:35:16,180 --> 02:35:18,900
The puncture, like, pop out the doll dresses.

992
02:35:19,620 --> 02:35:23,380
I would just dress up the dolls using the paper.

993
02:35:29,220 --> 02:35:32,740
Because that was before I was able to have Barbies or anything, right?

994
02:35:34,660 --> 02:35:37,700
So most of my toys were paper.

995
02:35:41,300 --> 02:35:41,780
Oops.

996
02:35:53,860 --> 02:35:55,780
Yeah, we... I just used what I had.

997
02:35:56,660 --> 02:35:58,660
The paper dolls were very cheap.

998
02:35:59,620 --> 02:36:05,060
Like, you could get a book with these, like, little, slightly cardboard-ish,

999
02:36:06,020 --> 02:36:12,180
cardboard-adjacent, um, paper dolls, and then I would take...

1000
02:36:12,980 --> 02:36:15,380
And then it's like furniture for all paper too.

1001
02:36:15,380 --> 02:36:24,500
So you would have to, like, assemble the, like, the, like, furniture and the beds

1002
02:36:25,140 --> 02:36:27,700
with, like, the paper.

1003
02:36:36,340 --> 02:36:41,780
So yeah, I'm like, wow. This is return to form, but as a kid,

1004
02:36:42,500 --> 02:36:44,420
I think I would have done a better job.

1005
02:36:45,940 --> 02:36:51,620
That's the sad part, is that I think I would have done a much better job.

1006
02:36:55,460 --> 02:36:57,460
Ugh.

1007
02:37:08,500 --> 02:37:11,620
I don't know if I want to torture some pies the strawberry fell off.

1008
02:37:16,660 --> 02:37:19,780
I don't know if I want to torture some pies with another cake.

1009
02:37:20,740 --> 02:37:25,860
Oh, that made a funny sound. It made a door-ing sound.

1010
02:37:41,220 --> 02:37:43,860
Second try, let's go!

1011
02:37:49,860 --> 02:37:51,860
Mmm.

1012
02:37:55,860 --> 02:37:57,860
Mmm.

1013
02:38:02,020 --> 02:38:04,020
Mmm.

1014
02:38:06,820 --> 02:38:08,820
Luzukashi.

1015
02:38:10,020 --> 02:38:12,980
I see. This is, it's hard.

1016
02:38:14,420 --> 02:38:17,860
I see it's hard. Look at that. Four-star difficulty.

1017
02:38:18,740 --> 02:38:23,780
Yeah, these are some fancy-ass cakes, huh? See, this is what the one I was supposed to make you look like.

1018
02:38:25,700 --> 02:38:27,700
Next one in the instructions was this one.

1019
02:38:31,380 --> 02:38:33,380
And then...

1020
02:38:34,660 --> 02:38:39,300
This one looks like the easiest, but I also don't trust myself to make it easy.

1021
02:38:47,860 --> 02:38:49,860
Mmm.

1022
02:39:01,620 --> 02:39:03,620
Yeah.

1023
02:39:12,020 --> 02:39:14,020
We made something, some pie.

1024
02:39:18,100 --> 02:39:22,340
Hold on, let me check. Which instructions belong where?

1025
02:39:35,940 --> 02:39:37,940
I think...

1026
02:39:38,420 --> 02:39:41,140
Yeah, it's this one. This is the instruction. Okay.

1027
02:39:43,060 --> 02:39:46,820
There's the star. Okay. I can do it again!

1028
02:39:48,820 --> 02:39:50,820
Probably.

1029
02:39:50,820 --> 02:39:52,820
Haven't.

1030
02:39:55,940 --> 02:39:57,940
My favorite saying.

1031
02:40:01,220 --> 02:40:03,220
There I go.

1032
02:40:04,980 --> 02:40:06,980
Yeah. Almost doesn't have.

1033
02:40:07,860 --> 02:40:14,740
And then, I'll pince it up, and then folds again. Up here it looks like.

1034
02:40:15,700 --> 02:40:17,700
Yeah, to this line.

1035
02:40:29,780 --> 02:40:33,300
And then this goes where?

1036
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:45,620
Oh, okay. So, so, so, so, so. Okay, I see it, I see it. This one goes, uh...

1037
02:40:50,660 --> 02:40:52,660
I think...

1038
02:40:53,300 --> 02:40:55,300
Back at the line that we went to before.

1039
02:41:04,180 --> 02:41:06,180
It had two papers stuck!

1040
02:41:07,380 --> 02:41:12,420
It has two papers stuck to it! I accidentally folded! Folded this one!

1041
02:41:12,660 --> 02:41:14,660
Ah!

1042
02:41:30,420 --> 02:41:32,420
Okay, okay.

1043
02:41:32,740 --> 02:41:34,740
I got this Senpai. I got this.

1044
02:41:35,940 --> 02:41:38,660
And then we fold down this line.

1045
02:41:39,380 --> 02:41:42,260
Yes, I have it! I have it!

1046
02:41:54,580 --> 02:41:56,580
I got it. Okay, and then this side.

1047
02:41:59,300 --> 02:42:06,020
Yes, yes. Okay, then we fold this side. Yes. Okay, I'm seeing it. I understand it.

1048
02:42:06,900 --> 02:42:08,900
Yes.

1049
02:42:13,460 --> 02:42:20,180
I see it. I understand. I'm getting... I'm picking up what they're putting down.

1050
02:42:28,020 --> 02:42:30,020
I can't even see.

1051
02:42:36,580 --> 02:42:38,580
Yes, yes, yes.

1052
02:42:46,500 --> 02:42:48,500
I see it. I see it.

1053
02:42:53,140 --> 02:42:55,140
Yes, yes, okay.

1054
02:42:55,700 --> 02:43:01,380
We folded that. Then we fold this. Yes, I'm seeing it. It's working!

1055
02:43:01,380 --> 02:43:03,380
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

1056
02:43:04,660 --> 02:43:06,900
We fold it again. Yes!

1057
02:43:10,820 --> 02:43:13,460
Oh-ho! Oh-ho!

1058
02:43:23,940 --> 02:43:28,100
Oh-ho! Oh-ho! Oh-ho! Oh-ho!

1059
02:43:31,780 --> 02:43:39,300
Look, there's like a little tuck in there. Okay.

1060
02:43:43,540 --> 02:43:45,540
Now what?

1061
02:43:50,900 --> 02:43:56,660
Ha! Oh, we unfold it now. Okay, understood. We unfold it.

1062
02:43:58,580 --> 02:44:00,580
Like that. Okay.

1063
02:44:01,380 --> 02:44:08,260
We unfold it again. And then...

1064
02:44:19,380 --> 02:44:24,420
Looks like we fold it like this. Oh! Okay, look. I'm starting to get it, Senpai.

1065
02:44:25,940 --> 02:44:28,260
Okay, so, so, so, so.

1066
02:44:31,700 --> 02:44:38,980
Okay. We did that. Now on this side.

1067
02:44:42,340 --> 02:44:44,340
What are they asking me to do?

1068
02:44:45,940 --> 02:44:50,180
Okay, okay. Wait, I got it. I got it. Okay, so they're asking me to fold this again.

1069
02:44:51,700 --> 02:44:53,860
Yes. I think.

1070
02:44:56,180 --> 02:44:58,180
I think.

1071
02:44:58,820 --> 02:45:04,420
Wait, hold on. Okay, I got that part. Yeah, I got that part. Yeah.

1072
02:45:09,140 --> 02:45:11,140
Okay, okay.

1073
02:45:28,580 --> 02:45:34,100
Okay, okay. I think I got it. I think I got it.

1074
02:45:37,300 --> 02:45:44,420
I think I got it. I think I got it. I think I got it. I'll let you know if I don't got it.

1075
02:45:44,420 --> 02:45:46,420
Which might be very soon.

1076
02:45:58,180 --> 02:46:10,100
I don't got it. Oh, wait. No, I got it.

1077
02:46:14,420 --> 02:46:18,820
We're back. We're back. We're back.

1078
02:46:20,820 --> 02:46:27,220
Wait, I misunderstood one of the assignments. And then now I'm back to understanding the

1079
02:46:27,220 --> 02:46:30,660
assignment sort of. I think.

1080
02:46:35,060 --> 02:46:35,380
Yes.

1081
02:46:40,020 --> 02:46:44,340
Yes. Okay. No, I got the assignment now.

1082
02:46:57,220 --> 02:47:02,820
Okay. Now that makes more sense.

1083
02:47:11,300 --> 02:47:12,340
Yes, that makes more sense.

1084
02:47:20,820 --> 02:47:22,340
Does it make more sense?

1085
02:47:27,940 --> 02:47:29,940
Okay.

1086
02:47:42,180 --> 02:47:50,500
Okay, wait. Like I said, do this. Okay, okay. Now, hold this up. Okay, okay.

1087
02:47:50,500 --> 02:48:05,860
Okay. Okay, now it looks like this. Okay, okay. Now we hold it to this line.

1088
02:48:05,860 --> 02:48:17,700
Okay. Now we hold it to this line. Okay.

1089
02:48:24,660 --> 02:48:25,060
And then

1090
02:48:25,940 --> 02:48:35,940
touch here, touch here.

1091
02:48:42,660 --> 02:48:45,700
Oh, wait. I'm getting somewhere. I'm getting somewhere.

1092
02:48:45,700 --> 02:48:59,540
Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait. Am I truly believing? Am I truly understanding the assignment?

1093
02:49:16,660 --> 02:49:21,540
Am I truly understanding the assignment?

1094
02:49:21,540 --> 02:49:25,540
Oh, oh, oh.

1095
02:49:46,660 --> 02:49:58,660
It's terrible, but I somewhat got it. It looks terrible, but I somewhat got it.

1096
02:50:08,660 --> 02:50:14,820
It's supposed to look like a box. I think I'm supposed to pinch the side so it like

1097
02:50:14,900 --> 02:50:24,660
flattens out or something. I don't know how they did that. Oh, no.

1098
02:50:25,380 --> 02:50:28,500
Oh.

1099
02:50:39,540 --> 02:50:47,940
This pulls cheated chocolate. I got to a point and then it's like, oh, okay. Yeah.

1100
02:50:48,260 --> 02:50:54,260
I got to a point where it's like, okay, now I'm just lost.

1101
02:50:59,220 --> 02:51:00,260
Now it's a brownie.

1102
02:51:04,820 --> 02:51:08,420
There it is. I somewhat folded it correctly.

1103
02:51:09,220 --> 02:51:18,260
I think the up here is not as square as I was hoping it to be, but I was

1104
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:25,780
using instructions as it was well instructed.

1105
02:51:29,060 --> 02:51:33,940
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom. Here you go, Senpai. You can have this delicious cake. Yeah.

1106
02:51:39,300 --> 02:51:41,300
Yeah.

1107
02:51:45,540 --> 02:51:51,780
Yeah. It's supposed to put like a sticker here for like the garnish.

1108
02:51:57,300 --> 02:52:03,300
Then here's my other cake that is falling apart. That's okay. It's falling apart. That's okay.

1109
02:52:04,100 --> 02:52:05,220
Just like all of us are.

1110
02:52:07,940 --> 02:52:13,140
And the strawberry that I was unable to make immaculate.

1111
02:52:34,020 --> 02:52:45,140
Yeah, cake.

1112
02:52:48,260 --> 02:52:49,060
Two cakes.

1113
02:52:51,220 --> 02:52:55,620
And then we'll just copy and paste and all Senpais can have more than one cake.

1114
02:52:57,220 --> 02:53:02,660
I don't know how they made it a square though. That's my mystery. I'm like, I got this far.

1115
02:53:03,300 --> 02:53:05,140
And I got it to a brownie.

1116
02:53:10,980 --> 02:53:14,580
Efficiency. You can eat it now like a sandwich.

1117
02:53:20,900 --> 02:53:25,860
Yeah, you can see the frosting.

1118
02:53:26,180 --> 02:53:39,140
It's like instructions unclear. My box thing looks flat and roundish.

1119
02:53:44,340 --> 02:53:47,620
Ah, the strawberry! Okay, now save.

1120
02:53:48,420 --> 02:53:58,020
I think I'm going to stop there, Senpais.

1121
02:54:00,100 --> 02:54:07,300
As much as I want to continue making you delicious paper cakes. I am terrible at it.

1122
02:54:12,500 --> 02:54:15,540
Did you have fun today? I know most of it was me eating a cake.

1123
02:54:18,500 --> 02:54:25,780
Look, we have our strawberry cake and

1124
02:54:30,100 --> 02:54:34,420
and our brownie.

1125
02:54:35,140 --> 02:54:46,180
And then I started making mistakes after mistakes.

1126
02:54:48,740 --> 02:54:50,260
Happy one month, look.

1127
02:54:52,900 --> 02:54:58,020
Happy one month, Senpai. And hopefully a lot more together.

1128
02:54:58,820 --> 02:55:10,260
You can't leave me now, okay? I've shared, I've shared my mistakes and my clumsiness with you.

1129
02:55:12,900 --> 02:55:23,620
Okay, you have to, you have to stay now.

1130
02:55:24,100 --> 02:55:35,220
I showed you my cake, please respond.

1131
02:55:38,660 --> 02:55:43,780
It's like you're all trapped here. Look, I made this ugly cake for you and I made this slightly

1132
02:55:43,780 --> 02:55:47,220
better cake for you.

1133
02:55:53,620 --> 02:56:06,180
Once we'll celebrate again when it's maybe five months and a year, no wait six months,

1134
02:56:07,060 --> 02:56:16,580
half year. I'll do our half year celebration and maybe birthday celebrations and of course,

1135
02:56:16,580 --> 02:56:21,540
you know, any other celebration. But I thought one month would be a good one.

1136
02:56:23,700 --> 02:56:31,220
After all, I did all you senpais. I did all you because I was going to do a hand cam and then

1137
02:56:31,780 --> 02:56:32,740
I had a huge rash.

1138
02:56:37,300 --> 02:56:39,540
And then I had a huge rash.

1139
02:56:44,260 --> 02:56:51,940
Yeah, the rash killed the original plan. I also went all over. I even went into the next town

1140
02:56:51,940 --> 02:56:59,780
to try to find like fishnets. They don't sell a lot of fishnets. So I had to, I had to get this

1141
02:56:59,780 --> 02:57:10,180
glove. So I hope that's okay senpai. Senpai. Wait, I heard birthday, happy birthday. It's not my

1142
02:57:10,180 --> 02:57:14,420
birthday. I said we'll celebrate again when it is my birthday.

1143
02:57:20,660 --> 02:57:23,140
Also, do you not know my birthday senpai?

1144
02:57:28,340 --> 02:57:33,540
Sounds like it's tripped to Spencer's. I don't think Spencer's had any either.

1145
02:57:34,340 --> 02:57:38,260
No, we know. Uh-huh, what is it then?

1146
02:57:41,780 --> 02:57:48,580
Huh? Yeah, yeah, it's when Julius Caesar died. Whoa.

1147
02:57:53,060 --> 02:57:57,380
Call. Senpai. Shut up. It's not my birthday.

1148
02:57:58,340 --> 02:58:04,740
Welcome back, Abby.

1149
02:58:08,580 --> 02:58:11,140
Stop it, stop it senpai. It's not my birthday.

1150
02:58:14,660 --> 02:58:21,300
It's not even, unless you're doing like a very merry-on birthday to me, to me.

1151
02:58:21,620 --> 02:58:27,620
A very merry-on birthday to you, to who, to me, to you.

1152
02:58:30,420 --> 02:58:40,100
Senpai, senpai. Thank you for 1-9-9, happy nop-

1153
02:58:43,140 --> 02:58:46,820
Okay, fine. I mean, there's cake and celebrating. It seems like a birthday.

1154
02:58:47,780 --> 02:58:53,300
Do you not want to celebrate? You don't want to celebrate our one month together? That's a

1155
02:58:53,300 --> 02:59:00,020
milestone, right? In relationships. Thank you, we suck at this.

1156
02:59:01,220 --> 02:59:06,500
Happy birthday, Abby. Boy says happy Canada Day. Yeah, that's true.

1157
02:59:08,500 --> 02:59:14,980
I'm so tired senpai though. I'm probably gonna fix this cough, maybe I'm actually coming down

1158
02:59:14,980 --> 02:59:28,180
with something. But thank you for joining me today. I hope you had a good one. I hope you liked my hands.

1159
02:59:28,420 --> 02:59:35,380
Senpai.

1160
02:59:39,940 --> 02:59:45,540
I gotta figure out how to take off these band-aids. By the way, this is my friend,

1161
02:59:45,540 --> 02:59:52,180
my gal pal came by and like gave me this and she's like, I lost my Naruto cosplay,

1162
02:59:52,180 --> 02:59:56,180

1163
03:00:02,500 --> 03:00:05,540
So yeah, thank you senpais for joining me today.

1164

03:00:13,780 --> 03:00:18,740
So thank you, peace.

1168
03:00:36,660 --> 03:00:40,340
This is the wrong account. That is the wrong schedule.

1169
03:00:44,180 --> 03:00:47,780
Hold on. Okay, okay.

1170
