Yeah, I love you

5
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,780
Welcome to Ohio

6
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,140
Welcome to the stream, can you guys hear my funny bunny?

7
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,960
Ah, I'm your funny bunny, oh my God

8
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
I'm not ready for this.

9
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,960
I'm basically literally only good as Serenity's low.

10
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
That's for your protection.

11
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Serenity's a little quiet.

12
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
Hold on.

13
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
I'm going to bump you on.

14
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
It looks like on the edge.

15
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
On.

16
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,960
There we go.

17
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
You're, you're, you're.

18
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Whee!

19
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
Better on.

20
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
Is this, is this loud enough?

21
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Or is it too loud now?

22
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,960
I'm going to bump you up on, um,

23
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
on what do you call it?

24
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Discord.

25
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Discord.

26
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,960
I'm hot in the moon.

27
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,960
Something, something, something on a summer afternoon.

28
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Something, something.

29
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
I don't remember the rest of the song.

30
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,960
I think this is good.

32
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Maybe a little bit more.

33
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
I can get closer.

34
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,960
I can get closer to the, hold on.

35
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Hey, little mama, let me just burn your ear.

36
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
Let me tell you something you'd really like to hear.

37
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
How's that?

38
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
How's that sound?

39
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
Tackle yackies a bit loud?

40
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Hold on.

41
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Let's turn down the tackles of the yackies.

42
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,960
It does have like a bang and bang and, uh, OTS.

43
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
OST?

44
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Oh my God.

45
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
OST.

46
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Original soundtrack.

47
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,960
Anyways, we wanted to ask you snippets and,

48
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
and sweetie buns a question.

49
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
Oh, this is really important.

50
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Genuinely, like very important.

51
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,960
We need to, I, we both need to know,

52
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,960
I need to know a little bit more.

53
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Mercy was pretty satisfied with what we came up with,

54
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,960
but I was like, should we, should we ask?

55
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,960
Yeah, we need to ask.

56
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
Okay, okay.

57
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,960
Well, Serenity, you may go first.

58
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:55,960
I, I, I, I, I, I, I was ready to leave, but,

59
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,960
I simply wanted to ask a question about,

60
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,960
our sweater puppies.

61
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,960
Yeah, our puppies.

62
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,940
Who's bigger?

63
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,940
Hahaha!

64
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,940
Hahahahaha!

65
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,980
Where are these things I'm bigger?

66
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,060
Where are these things I'm bigger?

67
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,560
I don't know!

68
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Hahahaha!

69
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Why?

70
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Hahahaha!

71
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,380
I think you're bigger.

72
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,020
See they're saying serenity.

73
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,020
Hahaha!

74
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,020
Now hold on!

75
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,020
Hold on!

76
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,020
Miku over here!

78
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
Hahaha!

79
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Oopsie!

80
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Ahahaha!

81
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,180
I see Serenity out, out, out doing.

82
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,020
Ha ha!

83
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,600
Hee hee hee hee hee!

84
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,520
Hmm.

85
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,360
This sounds like a trap?

86
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,560
No, it's like genuine, it's genuine.

87
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,040
We just need to know so we can,

88
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,120
so we can like buy, buy matching t-shirts.

89
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,960
Yeah.

90
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Oh, I was gonna say, oh, okay.

91
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,360
I was gonna say like, you know,

92
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,640
in case we have to like share bras or something,

93
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,480
like, you know, you gotta know.

94
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,960
We have to know.

95
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,800
Yeah, we have to know.

96
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,000
What if we wanted to like, swap swimsuits?

97
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,520
Have you ever gotten like a pair of a bikini?

98
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,520
A very relatable story.

99
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,360
Buying bikini tops and be like,

100
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,400
oh, this one's cute, but those bottoms aren't.

101
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,800
Like, you just mix and match.

102
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Very relatable to the snippets, right?

103
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,640
Hee hee hee hee!

104
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,880
Yeah, I feel like, I feel like definitely

105
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,240
for like, clothing size, we should get like a large,

106
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,760
so that both of us can like wear.

107
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,640
Or maybe an extra large for those puppies.

108
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

109
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,080

Like we were so happy together when I,

140
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,760
when you got into VNU, I was like, I had you on

141
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,720
five monitors.

142
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,280
I had you on the big TV.

143
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,400
I had you on my phone.

144
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
I had you on my iPad.

145
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,120
I had you on both of my monitors.

146
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Sweetie Buns know how embarrassing I've been for like,

147
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,720
like I have been a public nuisance.

148
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,720
I mean, I feel like, like we saw the watch along.

149
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,040
We, I cried.

150
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,600
I cried on your debut.

151
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,880
I cried on your debut.

152
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,720
Fuck it.

153
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,560
Oh my God.

154
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,640
I was like, I was trying so hard to keep it together

155
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,960
because I was like, no guys, it's totally normal right now.

156
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,240
I'm just really like me in the midst.

157
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,360
I'm just so like losing it

158
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,200
that I like immediately text you after.

159
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,520
I was like, ahhh.

160
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,520
Hold on.

161
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,920
They're reminding me to say I'm live.

162
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,040
I forgot to do that.

163
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,880
No, no, no, no, no.

164
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,880
No, no, no, no, no.

165
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
No, no, no, no, no.

166
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
No, no, no, no, no.

167
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,520
No, no, no, no, no.

168
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,480
What are you talking about?

169
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,320
Snippets don't have, they don't ring that fucking bell.

170
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,520
Snippets don't click notify me

171
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,400
when a Mercy's seen this one.

172
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,960
You guys don't do that.

173
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,000
Mercy's perfect.

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,240
You guys are the problem.

175
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,080
Hahaha.

176
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,280
Hold on, I'll do it.

177
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,120
I'll do it.

178
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,960
I got it.

179
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,800
I got it.

180
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,000
Don't worry, I have my Twitter's open.

181
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,800
Dead Name This app forever.

182
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,360
Live with.

183
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,200
Just a moment.

184
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
30 minutes, Ailee.

185
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,040
Good.

186
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,880
That's Sampai.

187
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,520
He's got the stamp of approval.

188
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,840
The stamp of approval.

189
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,800
That's Sampai.

190
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,880
Thumbs up.

191
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,160
He can propose.

192
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,520
Hahaha.

193
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,800
Hahaha.

194
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
I just have two lines set.

195
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,800
Look at these Sampais.

196
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,960
Look at these guys.

197
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
They're so loyal.

198
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,760
These wonderful, upstanding gentlemen.

199
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,840
Good boys.

200
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,320
Look at boys.

201
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,080
I'm so proud of you.

202
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,480
You're making me look good in front of Serenity.

203
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,320
That's great.

204
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,160
Hahaha.

205
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,040
Hold on, I got this.

206
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,440
Wait, Ting.

207
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,280
We can't leave.

208
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,760
We can't leave.

209
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,600
Hahaha.

210
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,680
Why would you want to leave a Macy stream though?

211
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,440
You don't want to be here forever?

212
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
You guys always act like,

213
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,320
oh, I don't want to be in the basement.

214
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,680
I don't want to be in the basement.

215
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,920
Why not?

216
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,760
Why not?

217
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,440
What's the problem here, officer?

218
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,040
You don't want a pumpkin bag?

219
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,280
You don't want the cutest waifu in town?

220
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,760
Are you kidding me?

221
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,520
I'm gonna be wrinkled.

222
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,960
Sounds like you need to spend more time in the basement.

223
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,240
Clearly you don't know the fucking privileges you have here.

224
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,360
It's so funny.

225
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,960
It's so funny because she's like,

226
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,800
she was like,

227
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,120
they need to pick out a bang and ring out help them.

228
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,720
Once we get married.

229
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,320
I'm begging.

230
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,480
Like, Sampais, I, you gotta like,

231
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,360
like I'm the one you call

232
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,440
if you need help picking out Mercy's ring

233
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,600
for when you're proposed to her.

234
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,160
I, I'm so sorry, I'm kind of like,

235
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,520
of course I understand, you're her Sampai,

236
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,080
like you get it, but like,

237
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,560
I don't know if I can trust you guys

238
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,960
picking out the perfect ring for her.

239
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,040
She's my bestie, you know?

240
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,400
Like, you need a second opinion.

241
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
I'm having so much fun.

242
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,080
I'm having so much fun right now.

243
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,200
This is so fun.

244
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,960
We haven't even started playing yet.

245
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,120
Okay, hold on Sampais.

246
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,640
We're gonna have to, oh, what's the word?

247
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,280
I'm gonna have to turn Pakoyaki party off for a second

248
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,720
so we can do the cold.

249
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,280
You know, you know the cold, right?

250
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,120
Good.

251
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,280
Okay, I'm connecting to a server.

252
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,040
Oh, it saves our progress.

253
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,200
It does?

254
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,280
Damn, we started playing and I were like,

255
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,920
wait, we should stop.

256
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,480
We had to test the game with the cold.

257
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,320
Come on.

258
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,640
Okay, no, we gotta go.

259
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,160
We look so good.

260
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,680
Don't worry, the batter is vegan.

261
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,720
Everything else is not.

262
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't worry.

263
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,520
There are no eggs have been used in this batter.

264
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,920
No eggs allowed.

265
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,840
However, Mercy did come to me with a very important rule.

266
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,480
So if you can notice in the corner of the screen,

267
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,680
we do have to do squat.

268
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,120
So whenever we will, oh God, oh God, I have to eat.

269
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,480
I'm dying, I'm out.

270
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,920
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm out.

271
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,920
Oh, we gotta do this now.

272
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,280
I'm not gonna eat, I'm a hungry girl.

273
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,440
I'm hungry, I don't even have fiber sauce.

274
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,160
I have no time for sauce, I just gotta go.

275
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,840
Other one, we're gonna die.

276
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,160
Look at these sauce.

277
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,280
Munch, munch, munch, munch, munch, munch.

278
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,480
Oh, I'm overeating, hold on,

279
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,760
we gotta do real squats in real life.

280
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,760
Oh, don't eat, don't eat, don't eat, don't eat, don't eat.

281
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Okay, okay, okay, okay, I've squatted, I've squatted.

282
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,520
No, one squat each time.

283
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,400
Wait, is it, okay, I was squatting with the guy.

284
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,120
Is it only one squat per?

285
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,720
We can just like keep going.

286
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,040
Okay, okay.

287
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,040
You guys get dinner and a show, you're welcome.

288
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,320
We're so good.

289
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,280
Oh, I'm so bad at this.

290
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,240
No, you're perfect.

291
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,520
You make the best takoyaki, are you kidding?

292
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,720
Oh, I forgot to eat these once.

293
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,740
Oh, good.

294
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,800
That's how good your takoyaki is,

295
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,480
it's so good that you're like, oh man,

296
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,080
I can't even remember if I ate it or not yet.

297
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,400
One, two.

298
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,080
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,

299
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,160
shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,

300
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
munch, munch, oh shit.

301
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,000
Ah!

302
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,560
Oh, god, yes it is, it's very bad to run out of protein.

303
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,240
Oh, hold on, I'm sorry, I'll squatter.

304
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,840
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

305
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,020
Okay, I cannot sit at crisscross applesauce today.

306
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,820
Oh, oh, oh, applesauce today.

307
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
This is one, two, three, four.

308
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,860
Okay, I need to eat protein or I'm gonna fucking die.

309
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,960
No, you're not gonna get squatter!

310
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,800
I'm gonna get squatter!

311
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,720
Oh, no!

312
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,840
We have to squat or else we're gonna die.

313
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,740
Look at how many days we've been alive.

314
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,740
We're only for the live shooting!

315
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,740
Oh my legs!

316
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,740
No, it's so fine. It's so fine.

317
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,740
Can I get anything but cheese?

318
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,740
Can I get anything?

319
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,740
I need meat!

320
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,740
I need beef!

321
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,740
Give me the beef!

322
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,740
No beef for you!

323
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,740
You lover!

324
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,740
Girl, I'm gonna...

325
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,740
Give me...

326
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,740
That sausage isn't enough.

327
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,740
Sausages aren't enough.

328
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,740
Even now, the sausage...

329
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,740
Oh shit!

330
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,740
Don't die!

331
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,740
Don't die!

332
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,740
Give me that sausage!

333
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,740
Give me the yummy sausage!

334
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,740
Yumtown USA over here!

335
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,740
And we're going to be doing it today!

336
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,740
I'm in pain!

337
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,740
I'm in pain!

338
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,740
Yeah, me too!

339
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,740
Okay, I'm gonna add the sauce.

340
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,740
Oh, wait a minute!

341
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,740
Okay!

342
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,740
One!

343
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,740
One!

344
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,740
Oh shit!

345
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,740
Oh!

346
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,740
One!

347
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,740
One!

348
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,740
Oh shit!

349
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,740
I'm going with the guy!

350
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,740
Okay, okay, okay!

351
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,740
Senpai!

352
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,740
This really hurts!

353
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,740
Yo, Senpai, what the fuck?

354
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,740
Why is it always cheese?

355
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,740
I know! I don't eat cheese!

356
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,740
I have too much fat!

357
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,740
God, I wish I had...

358
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,740
I'm gonna fucking die!

359
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,740
I'm like fucking...

360
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,740
Okay, one!

361
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,740
Okay, okay!

362
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,740
One!

363
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,740
I'm malnutrition and I'm...

364
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,740
Two!

365
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,740
Oh my god!

366
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,740
Start pouring the batter in!

367
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,740
I don't like...

368
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,740
We're not things we wanted to talk about!

369
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
Shit!

370
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,740
Shit!

371
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,740
We had things we wanted to talk about!

372
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,740
I was like, oh!

373
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,740
I have to save these like...

374
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,740
Stories for stream, huh?

375
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,740
I should...

376
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,740
I should save...

377
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,740
But now we're in panic mode!

378
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,740
Oh god!

379
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,740
Oh god, oh god, oh god!

380
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,740
Okay, okay!

381
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,740
There's no time!

382
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,740
Anyways, Senpai!

383
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,740
Ah, my protein!

384
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,740
Don't die!

385
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,740
Okay!

386
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,740
Isn't it cool?

387
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
That I'm gonna die!

388
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,740
Isn't that so cool?

389
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,740
Let me see your eyes!

390
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,740
Oh, you bitch!

391
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,740
This is not cool!

392
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,740
My princess needs it!

393
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,740
We love each other!

394
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,740
Oh god!

395
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,740
Grab some on this side,

396
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,740
if you need more protein!

397
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,740
Thank you!

398
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,740
On this side?

399
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,740
I'm eating!

400
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,740
Oh, I'm full, I'm full, I can...

401
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,740
I don't think I need to bake!

402
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,740
So anyways, Senpai,

403
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,740
don't you think it's like really cool?

404
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,740
I'm gonna fuck you!

405
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,740
Malnutrition?

406
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,740
Oh fuck!

407
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,740
Oh no!

408
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,740
Oh no!

409
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,740
Goodbye, goodbye world!

410
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,740
Oh no, she's fucking dead!

411
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,740
Oh my god, I lived, bitch!

412
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,740
Okay, what?

413
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,740
I died!

414
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,740
Oh no, play her dead!

415
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,740
We're getting...

416
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,740
We're back in it, baby!

417
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,740
And I can eat so much takoyaki right now!

418
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,740
Yum, yum, yum!

419
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,740
Here, I'll eat this bad one over here too, yummy!

420
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
Malnutrition already!

421
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,740
Oh, beef?

422
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,740
Okay, you know, mercy,

423
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,740
I'm not gonna lie,

424
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,740
it's kind of good dying.

425
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,740
Dying was kind of a good choice.

426
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,740
Dying was a good choice?

427
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,740
Words I never expected to hear.

428
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,740
Oh shit!

429
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,740
Goodbye!

430
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,740
Was it the protein?

431
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,740
I need the protein!

432
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,740
I got you, I got you, I got you!

433
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,740
I said I'm overeating though!

434
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,740
We got, we got four steaks cooking!

435
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,740
Okay, these are steaks,

436
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,740
I can't give it to you?

437
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,740
No!

438
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,740
Oh god, I gotta eat.

439
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,740
I'm so upset!

440
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,740
Goodbye!

441
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,740
No!

442
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,740
This game is cruel!

443
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,740
This game is cruel!

444
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,740
We might not,

445
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,740
we might have to not do squats,

446
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,740
I'm already tired!

447
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,740
I might have to not do squats!

448
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,740
I'm determined though,

449
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,740
I'm gonna keep doing it!

450
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,740
You're gonna keep doing it?

451
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,740
Okay, I don't know,

452
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,740
it's okay!

453
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,740
I'll do it,

454
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,740
I'll do it with you!

455
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,740
You know,

456
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,740
I'll ask the senpai,

457
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,740
senpai,

458
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,740
did you want us to keep doing squats,

459
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,740
or is the answer not what we like?

460
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,740
Not what we like!

461
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,740
Maybe senpais will be like,

462
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,740
oh my god, no mercy,

463
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,740
your legs are tired,

464
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,740
we love you!

465
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,740
Don't make morning noises

466
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,740
in the mic, fra!

467
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,740
No, for what?

468
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,740
No!

469
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,740
What kind of thing

470
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,740
senpai would want that?

471
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,740
Wow!

472
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,740
I had to be,

473
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,740
I told them to behave around you,

474
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,740
and then look at you!

475
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,740
Look at you!

476
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,740
You said behave around me,

477
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,740
and then I DM'd you saying,

478
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,740
hey, is it okay if I say,

479
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,740
mods circumcised?

480
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,740
I've been telling them,

481
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,740
that like,

482
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,740
it's like, hey,

483
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,740
it's like,

484
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,740
mods obliterate his destes!

485
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,740
Mods,

486
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,740
make his foreskin away,

487
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,740
he doesn't get the extra pocket now.

488
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,740
You look like you shouldn't

489
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,740
be wearing a dress like this today,

490
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,740
hold on.

491
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,740
Whoa!

492
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,740
Gotta wait 18 seconds for this.

493
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,740
I feel my neck is so sweaty right now.

494
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,740
Man, I have no protein!

495
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,740
Here, I'll take the nasty ones.

496
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,740
Don't worry,

497
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,740
I'll put proteins

498
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,740
kinda near you-ish.

499
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,740
There you go.

500
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,740
Remember you.

501
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,740
Anyway!

502
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,740
Surprise!

503
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,740
What are-

504
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,740
Oh, shit, man,

505
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,740
I've lost all the fun stories

506
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,740
I wanted to talk about.

507
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,740
I'm like,

508
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,740
oh, I remember!

509
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,740
When I texted you,

510
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,740
right before the,

511
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,740
your designs got

512
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,740
announced,

513
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,740
when you guys were still

514
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,740
little silhouettes,

515
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,740
I remember,

516
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,740
when I messaged you,

517
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,740
cause I was like,

518
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,740
ugh, what was your nickname?

519
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,740
Stabs.

520
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,740
Stabs!

521
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,740
Yeah!

522
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,740
I was like,

523
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,740
I hope stabs is like,

524
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,740
a seamstress.

525
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,740
Cause I'm like,

526
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,740
I want you to make clothes.

527
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,740
Again?

528
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,740
Can I stop getting my city bill?

529
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,740
Oh god, I got a squat.

530
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,740
I got a squat.

531
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,740
This is painful!

532
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,740
This is what I'm feeling right now.

533
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,740
Okay.

534
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,740
No, so, always overeating.

535
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,740
This is too much calories.

536
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,740
It really is.

537
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,740
This isn't healthy.

538
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,740
This isn't,

539
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,740
for the amount of squats we're doing in between,

540
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,740
this is not a healthy amount of food.

541
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,740
This is like,

542
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,740
we're doing so much squats,

543
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,740
and I feel like I'm dying.

544
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,740
I don't care if I'm gonna overeat.

545
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,740
I don't care if I'm gonna overeat.

546
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,740
I gotta eat it!

547
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,740
I gotta eat this!

548
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,740
Have you ever gone to like,

549
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,740
a KVDQ place,

550
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,740
and like an,

551
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,740
oh you can eat buffet,

552
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,740
where they charge you

553
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,740
if you don't finish?

554
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,740
Oh yeah!

555
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,740
And then they give you extra,

556
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,740
because they're,

557
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,740
they're so rude.

558
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,740
I am!

559
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,740
Oh my god.

560
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,740
Oh my,

561
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,740
cause it doesn't even give us enough.

562
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,740
It doesn't give us enough to eat all.

563
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,740
Okay.

564
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,740
The music suddenly changed to,

565
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,740
10 Ho Ten Gay.

566
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,740
It changed.

567
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,740
It was so fun before.

568
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,740
It was like a fun piano.

569
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,740
And now,

570
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,740
now it's just pain.

571
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,740
Now it's just sweating.

572
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,740
It's like the beginning

573
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,740
of like 10 Ho Ten Gay,

574
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,740
where it's like,

575
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,740
I'm like sweating.

576
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,740
It's like we're here.

577
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,740
I feel hot.

578
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,740
I gotta take off these slippers.

579
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,740
What?

580
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,740
No.

581
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,740
Three.

582
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,740
Four.

583
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,740
Okay.

584
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,740
It's like four,

585
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,740
four squats per thing.

586
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,740
I can do that.

587
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,740
I can do four squats.

588
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,740
Fuck.

589
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,740
Anyway, so have you been today, Macy?

590
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,740
It's okay.

591
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,740
I was literally,

592
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,740
my mind was nothing,

593
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,740
but to like today,

594
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,740
I was like,

595
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,740
I can't do anything else.

596
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,740
Everything today,

597
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,740
revolves around,

598
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
my funny bunny.

599
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,740
I'm so excited

600
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,740
for today.

601
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,740
I've been looking for it

602
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,740
since your debut.

603
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,740
I'm so happy

604
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,740
we're playing this game

605
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,740
because it looked really fun.

606
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,740
It's a good time.

607
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,740
I'm fucking sweating.

608
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,740
You too?

609
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,740
Me too.

610
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,740
I hope I better like,

611
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,740
lose like,

612
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,740
at least a pound.

613
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,740
Oh my God,

614
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,740
definitely at least.

615
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,740
Cause like,

616
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,740
it's like every 18 seconds,

617
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,740
cause like,

618
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,740
one,

619
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,740
two,

620
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,740
three,

621
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,740
four.

622
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,740
Okay.

623
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,740
Oh God.

624
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,740
All the way down.

625
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,740
Oh.

626
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,740
I need to stop eating cucumbers.

627
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,740
That's my problem.

628
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,740
I'm just fully standing now.

629
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,740
I'm just fully,

630
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,740
I'm just fully standing.

631
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,740
I'm just standing now.

632
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,740
This is,

633
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,740
this is no longer a stream.

634
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,740
This is business.

635
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,740
This is business.

636
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,740
Oh no, it's burning.

637
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,740
It's burning.

638
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,740
Or,

639
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,740
okay, okay, okay.

640
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,740
This is business.

641
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,740
God damn it.

642
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,740
Another cucumber.

643
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,740
God, it's like the cucumbers are,

644
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,740
are big.

645
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,740
They're, they're meant,

646
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,740
they're meant to ruin us.

647
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,740
Give us meat.

648
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,740
More meat.

649
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,740
Can I just like,

650
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,740
toss this away?

651
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,740
Yeah.

652
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,740
Fuck this.

653
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,740
Fuck this cheese.

654
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,740
Fuck this cheese.

655
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,740
Look at this cheese out of here.

656
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,740
Give me the beef.

657
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,740
Here's more beef.

658
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,740
We need it.

659
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,740
We need all the beef.

660
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,740
This can be gross.

661
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,740
Actually that is sparkling.

662
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,740
Does that mean I have that?

663
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,740
I'm gonna die.

664
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,740
I'm gonna die.

665
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,740
Oh my God, I'm out of fat.

666
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,740
I'm out of fat.

667
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,740
I'm out of,

668
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,740
oh my God.

669
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,740
No, no, no.

670
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,740
Okay.

671
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
Eat you.

672
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,740
And I put favorite candy.

673
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,740
That's not,

674
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,740
that's not enough.

675
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,740
Oh my God.

676
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,740
Oh my God.

677
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,740
Oh my God.

678
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
My protein is so low.

679
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,740
I, I'm,

680
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
this is it.

681
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,740
This is it for me.

682
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,740
And I'm overeaten.

683
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,740
No, goodbye.

684
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,740
Goodbye.

685
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,740
I have no protein,

686
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,740
no fat,

687
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,740
I'm nothing.

688
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,740
Goodbye.

689
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,740
Player dead.

690
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,740
This is,

691
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,740
this is it.

692
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,740
This is what you were playing for.

693
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,740
This is the relief.

694
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,740
My legs are chilly.

695
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,740
I sat down again.

696
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,740
Fuck.

697
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,740
Fuck.

698
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,740
Guys,

699
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,740
you don't know how dangerous it is to eat takoyaki

700
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,740
until you're right there in the fucking pit.

701
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,740
Until God is looking you in the eyes

702
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,740
and all you could say is more, please.

703
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,740
Give me another cucumber.

704
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,740
Where's the beef?

705
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,740
You don't know real pain.

706
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,740
You don't know real pain and suffering

707
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,740
until you've been faced with the takoyaki gods

708
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,740
and you've been told

709
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,740
you four squats per 18 seconds.

710
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,740
And what are you going to do?

711
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,740
Say no.

712
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,740
We live and die by our takoyaki gods.

713
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,740
We live and die by the takoyaki gods.

714
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,740
We cannot deny them.

715
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,740
Oh, no.

716
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,740
My imminent death.

717
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,740
Oh, wait, no.

718
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,740
We're good.

719
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,740
We'll go dribble off to that sweet good night.

720
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,740
Oh, wait.

721
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,740
There's emails.

722
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,740
I didn't realize.

723
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,740
Oh, shit.

724
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,740
Yeah.

725
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,740
Me when I met you.

726
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,740
I'm going to fucking die.

727
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,740
No.

728
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,740
No, you're too sexy.

729
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,740
Don't die.

730
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,740
You're too sexy.

731
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,740
Don't die.

732
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,740
You're too sexy.

733
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,740
You can't die.

734
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,740
No.

735
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,740
Can I just drop these?

736
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,740
I can.

737
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,740
Yeah, fuck these little balls.

738
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,740
Get these balls out of here.

739
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,740
Girl, are you still alive?

740
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,740
No.

741
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,740
Oh.

742
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,740
Well, there goes the balls.

743
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,740
I don't know how you're still alive.

744
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,740
No, it's barely holding on.

745
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,740
I'm proud of you.

746
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,740
Survive, baby cakes.

747
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,740
Barely holding on.

748
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,740
The last beef.

749
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,740
One, two, three.

750
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,740
Oh, God.

751
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,740
Oh, my legs are getting shaky.

752
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,740
Oh, I'm entering shaky zone of the squat.

753
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,740
Of the squatathon.

754
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,740
Come on.

755
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,740
Ah, fuck, I died.

756
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,740
No.

757
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,740
Drink time.

758
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,740
Yeah.

759
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,740
Oh, my God.

760
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,740
Yeah.

761
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,740
This is the only time we get a break here.

762
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,740
Honestly.

763
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,740
It's the only time that we have a chance to breathe.

764
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,740
I'm...

765
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,740
Okay.

766
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,740
Back in the game, baby.

767
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,740
I feel like I have so much.

768
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,740
Oh, my God, I've eaten a hundred takoyaki.

769
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,740
It tells you how many?

770
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,740
I got an achievement.

771
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,740
It's like, congratulations, eater.

772
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,740
Oh, my God.

773
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,740
I can't just say that to somebody.

774
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,740
Day two.

775
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,740
This is when I die.

776
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,740
Oh, God.

777
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,740
Okay.

778
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,740
Let me do some squats real fine.

779
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,740
Okay.

780
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,740
It's all time.

781
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,740
Oh, never mind.

782
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,740
300 calories already gone.

783
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,740
Grab those two.

784
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,740
God.

785
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,740
I just...

786
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,740
I don't get how they're like, yeah, this is easy.

787
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,740
What's the most...

788
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,740
Wasn't this suggested by your manager?

789
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,740
We're already out of breath and coughing.

790
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,740
Your lungs out?

791
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,740
Yeah.

792
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,740
Professor Hamstein was like, hey, serenity.

793
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,740
Do you know that we are really fun to game for you?

794
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,740
And I'm like, oh, boy, Professor Hamstein, why?

795
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,740
Oh, boy.

796
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,740
Oh, boy, what is it?

797
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,740
Oh.

798
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,740
You're squatting again.

799
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,740
I'm squatting.

800
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,740
I can't do it.

801
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,740
I can't do it.

802
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,740
No.

803
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,740
I can't do it.

804
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,740
I can't do it.

805
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,740
I ate 100 chocolate yaki.

806
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,740
I got the...

807
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,740
I got it.

808
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,740
No, they're all burned.

809
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,740
I'll take some.

810
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,740
Oh, they're all burnt.

811
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,740
Just pause it.

812
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,740
Just pause it.

813
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,740
I have to...

814
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,740
I think I have to strip.

815
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,740
Yeah.

816
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,740
Oh, my God.

817
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,740
Girl, me too.

818
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,740
I'm ready.

819
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,740
Girl, I'm like...

820
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,740
Now we're gaming.

821
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,740
Okay.

822
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,740
I'm wearing a workout shirt.

823
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,740
Out.

824
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,740
I have my elbow on my closet.

825
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,740
Okay.

826
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,740
I'm ready.

827
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,740
My entire back is like a freaking swamp.

828
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,740
It's fucking business now.

829
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,740
This isn't a game anymore.

830
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,740
This is business, guys.

831
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,740
This is business snippets.

832
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,740
You guys don't understand.

833
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,740
This is what happens.

834
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,740
We're like, yeah, we're going to do squats with the game.

835
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,740
What a foolish idea.

836
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:52,740
When you take two girls who commit to the bit too hard,

837
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,740
and we're like, yeah, yeah, we'll do squats.

838
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,740
What?

839
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,740
Like it's hard?

840
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,740
Oh, this is so much better.

841
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,740
Okay.

842
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,740
Yeah.

843
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,740
I feel the breeze.

844
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,740
I feel the breeze.

845
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,740
Oh, my God.

846
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,740
It's like I was wearing just like my nightgown.

847
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,740
That was a mistake.

848
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,740
Yeah.

849
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,740
Yeah, no.

850
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,740
I was like, I have this like cute like dress I've been trying out.

851
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,740
And I was like, oh yeah, this dress, it's fine.

852
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,740
I'm in my cozy.

853
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,740
My cozy alleys.

854
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,740
No, it's business now.

855
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,740
It's business now.

856
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,740
This is survival.

857
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,740
Oh, shit.

858
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,740
Oh, shit.

859
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,740
I'm running out of protein again.

860
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,740
I'm like that one guy from home sweet home.

861
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:53,740
Protein protein protein.

862
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,740
Okay.

863
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:05,740
I'm like hitting the like squat button because I'm waiting for the squat to come back.

864
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,740
I know.

865
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,740
I know I should be doing that too.

866
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,740
You know, I should just be actively squatting.

867
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,740
Is that a peppermint takoyaki?

868
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,740
I think we're supposed to like eat them to like shit.

869
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,740
I dropped that one.

870
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,740
Oh, shit.

871
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,740
Oh, shit.

872
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,740
Fuck.

873
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,740
Fuck.

874
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,740
Fuck.

875
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,740
Drop it.

876
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,740
Drop it.

877
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,740
Drop it.

878
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,740
Drop this.

879
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,740
Eat.

880
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,740
Eat.

881
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,740
Eat.

882
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,740
There we go.

883
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,740
There we go.

884
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,740
Okay.

885
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,740
Grab you guys.

886
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,740
I know.

887
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,740
I know I'm dying.

888
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,740
What do you want from me?

889
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,740
I swear.

890
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,740
If we're going to get demonetized for exercising, that would be hilarious.

891
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,740
That'd be so fucked up.

892
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,740
All we're doing is we're just girly things.

893
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,740
Oh, oh, you.

894
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,740
Now my back is numb.

895
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,740
No.

896
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,740
I go outside, but not that much.

897
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,740
Please, please, please.

898
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,740
One, two, three.

899
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,740
I'm committing to the death.

900
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,740
Four.

901
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,740
Okay.

902
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,740
Okay.

903
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,740
Eat.

904
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,740
Eat.

905
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,740
Oh, I'm going to fucking die.

906
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,740
No.

907
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,740
No, baby.

908
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,740
It's a sexy.

909
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,740
Don't die.

910
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,740
Don't die.

911
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,740
Don't die.

912
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,740
Can you extra beef?

913
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,740
Do you need protein?

914
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,740
You need fat.

915
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,740
Oh, cheese.

916
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,740
Beef.

917
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,740
Beef and fat.

918
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,740
Beef.

919
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,740
Beef.

920
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,740
Fat.

921
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,740
Cheese.

922
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,740
Fat.

923
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,740
I'm going to say it.

924
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,740
Why did I eat cucumber?

925
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,740
Why did I eat cucumber?

926
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,740
No.

927
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,740
No.

928
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,740
Octopus.

929
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,740
No.

930
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,740
Oh, God.

931
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,740
It's over for me too, Bab.

932
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,740
It's over.

933
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,740
We can't think about suffering.

1065
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:50,620
I don't know if we can win. I'll be honest. I don't think there's a winner into this game. I just think we're all losers

1066
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,740
I think I think we lost the moment we played

1067
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,460
That's

1068
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,780

And you're seeing stars and you're sweating non-stop sweating just buckets

In order to get more ingredients

1102
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,940
How the fuck are we supposed to survive?

1103
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,580
I don't know

1104
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:48,220
I think we can't egg max. Oh wait, but we can't egg's evil egg is evil

1105
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:54,540
Let me let me eat. Let me eat everything. Let me eat my piggy fill

1106
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,700
I'll eat all the eggs. Don't worry. I won't let them touch you

1107
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,540
Get away from her

1108
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,820
Get behind me queen get behind me

1109
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,540
Shh

1110
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:16,140
God the squats is crazy squats is actually crazy like

1111
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:20,540
What a fun game that we get to play wow

1112
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,860
Oh, shit

1113
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:29,500
I mean maybe but what you want to see dry dry balls like this

1114
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,940
You want us dry balls? We need we need our fat

1115
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,660
Ha my voice cracked

1116
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:45,740
We need we need the extra fat are you kidding every calorie counts

1117
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,980
I'm trying

1118
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:01,580
Okay, I think I think I think we need a strat

1119
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,220
We need a strategy

1120
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,620
I don't even know what you guys are good for

1121
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:14,060
We need a strategy and the strategy isn't squat squat squat squat squat

1122
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,860
No, but squatting is important. I think we got to be squatting

1123
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,740
We have to eat

1124
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:23,740
Oh, that was nothing

1125
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,340
and then

1126
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,700
We don't

1127
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:30,460
We don't we don't flip all of them. We only flip the ones we need

1128
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:37,100
They don't burn while they're like still batter, right? Yeah. Yeah, they don't burn while they're batter

1129
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:41,980
So I feel like if we just do what we need

1130
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:47,740
And we squat often because our calories our calories are killing us

1131
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:51,820
Our calories and our fat and protein are killing us

1132
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:53,580
Yeah

1133
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,780
fat and protein are really fucking us over but

1134
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,740
Okay, I'm dead

1135
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,700
No, no

1136
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,700
Looks at the ingredient list. There's so many

1137
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:08,940
There's so many girl. There's so many. We're so like there's a skill thing

1138
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,980
I can upgrade it

1139
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,980
We can upgrade our skills

1140
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,300
We have skills

1141
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,820
We can upgrade our skills

1142
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,980
We we've been suffering and for what?

1143
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:36,700
What are you what are you putting into your skill tree? I'm just doing one of everything

1144
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:42,700
Wait, how many clicks do you have 13? Oh my god

1145
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,940
This whole time

1146
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:56,700
I'm so I'm so in a mood

1147
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,420
I don't know what kind of mood it is, but I'm in that fucking mood

1148
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,100
This whole time

1149
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,940
Thank you for the 10 gifted finish

1150
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,380
Wait, I wasn't looking can you do it again?

1151
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,300
Look at you

1152
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,300
What a tricky bunny

1153
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,740
Oh

1154
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,340
If you feel bad

1155
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:39,100
But like it'd be cool, you know, it's like doing a flip

1156
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,300
No, I'll drop the cheese

1157
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:54,060
I can't believe there's a skill tree. I can't believe there's a fucking skill tree

1158
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:59,660
I didn't realize there are the skill tree until low now. Thank you boy for the five gifted

1159
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,740
I still think it's hilarious. I was like everyone behave around serenity

1160
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,900
I

1161
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:24,380
And then I and then I was like, all right, it's my bestie

1162
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,340
I

1163
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:46,220
Yes, I can consume more

1164
01:00:55,100 --> 01:01:01,500
I got to keep the taco yaki. I put into my dip the batter. I mean batter is now dip

1165
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,740
Just a little extra. We love our summon now out here

1166
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,620
Oh shit, I didn't listen to my own fucking rules. I said I'm so sorry

1167
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:18,060
I I get so distracted. I like flipping the balls. It's really fun

1168
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:22,620
It's like I love flipping balls

1169
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,380
Let's flip them

1170
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:33,740
Okay, I'm gonna see if I can do my little trick of getting that spare. Nope. Can I get the spare ball?

1171
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:37,180
I think I can

1172
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,620
I'll put in the the stuff for us

1173
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:49,020
I'm lasting longer. I'm lasting way longer now that we put the skill in

1174
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,460
You're doing way better

1175
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:55,820
Oh, shit. Well, we gotta make it to at least four day four

1176
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:59,580
We gotta we gotta make it today like 100

1177
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:16,540
I like that you can just hear me slamming my face

1178
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,860
I

1179
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:28,380
Business now, you know, like straight straight taco yaki business taco yaki party taco yaki

1180
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:35,340
They weren't kidding about the survival part. They really weren't taco yaki. Thank you. You sat all by the way

1181
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,340
Do

1182
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,940
Fun mashing

1183
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,540
This is so chaotic

1184
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,540
It was a terrible idea to try

1185
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,860
to try to

1186
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:53,100
feel like in corporate like real life squats

1187
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,900
Gave up in half an hour

1188
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:01,100
I'm down. I if we wanted to try it again, I would I would

1189
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:05,980
Mama ain't no quitter or mama didn't raise no quitter. She raised me a quitter

1190
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:11,580
She needs to know our limits and to take breaks when needed

1191
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:19,420
Any gym bro will tell you it's important to have a break or something. I don't know. I'm not a gym bro

1192
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:24,380
I am so scared of the gym mostly because of the cost

1193
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:28,940
Oh my god, I know it's so expensive now

1194
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:36,140
Then they have like the cancellation fee and like the membership fee and then the

1195
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:40,540
Then the then the like overhead fees and I'm like, what the heck fee

1196
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:43,420
I know

1197
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:49,020
I've I've been looking into getting my own gym equipment at home. But like gosh, that's expensive too

1198
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:51,020
Oh

1199
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:01,420
50 squats

1200
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:09,500
I feel like it's lied to me. I feel like I did more than that in real life

1201
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:12,620
I know

1202
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:18,380
This game this game doesn't count the real life squats. They don't know they don't know you've been squatting

1203
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,820
They don't know your powerful legs your glutes

1204
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:26,060
My glutes are screaming for the high heavens

1205
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:43,420
Good, you know, I feel like I wouldn't be dying this fast if I was low on protein in real life

1206
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,620
Like I feel like what are we even?

1207
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:50,700
What kind of

1208
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:55,900
paper skin and glass bones motherfucker. Okay skill tree I

1209
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:00,220
Come 14 skills. There you go

1210
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:06,860
During malnutrition time can be accepted. Yes. Yes

1211
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:12,940
Absorption what what do you mean absorption?

1212
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,900
I dig the burnt one

1213
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:28,220
Like that's what I did I just upgraded everything

1214
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:34,380
Okay, because I think the absorption makes your like protein and stuff last longer

1215
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:36,940
Got you

1216
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:39,340
And I'm like bitch better last longer

1217
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,500
Honestly

1218
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:47,660
Like I am done being a weak baby

1219
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,100
Terrible genes

1220
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:54,860
Extra absorb or I guess not absorb in

1221
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:01,900
I want to be extra absorbent. Let me absorb. Okay, so I have two so let me do these four

1222
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,100
Yeah, oh, you're right. You're right. You're so right

1223
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:07,580
Okay

1224
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,420
And then it like lasts a bit longer

1225
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:20,140
Thank you for the two dollar tip. Thank you, darling visa pie

1226
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:24,780
Remember no matter how many takoyaki you eat and how sick it makes you never stops

1227
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:30,460
Eaters are quitters

1228
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,580
Okay, well, they're not wrong

1229
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:40,540
Count as a roguelite. We do have the skill tree. You're right. It is kind of

1230
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:52,380
I'm like, I mean sometimes are not wrong, but you don't have to say it out loud silly

1231
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:56,140
It's the unspoken rule for a reason

1232
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:03,020
Going out speaking all the unspoken things silly

1233
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,820
Like this is why we can't have secrets

1234
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:26,460
Is that true senpai you get excited to tell me everything about your life

1235
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:29,740
That's pretty cute senpai

1236
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:37,740
And you get so excited you're just like, oh boy, I can't wait for mercy to know how I feel about spinning

1237
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:44,460
Okay, we're on the fourth day. Oh my god, we are

1238
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:50,060
Oh, you are that's how I look now you survive my queen

1239
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:55,660
Don't let them don't let them take your life away. Oh, I should eat

1240
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:58,380
It's gonna be like a while before they take my life away

1241
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:01,340
Yeah, no, you're living look at you

1242
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,140
Oops, I actually ate it

1243
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:18,780
We're like strong now because we're like there was a skill tree

1244
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:24,940
We figured out how to play the game

1245
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:31,100
Oh, yes, let me squat squat and eat squat and eat

1246
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:36,140
It's like it's like those competitive, um eating

1247
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:41,100
Uh, you know like the guys sweet hot dogs that report to july or whatever

1248
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,140
Oh, yeah

1249
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:48,700
Yeah, that's what it's called. Apparently they don't even like chew. They just swallow

1250
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:51,980
No, no, it's kind of more fucked up than that really

1251
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:56,140
Yeah, no, they dip it in water first and then they just kind of swallow it

1252
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,500
Which like I feel like is worse, you know

1253
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:03,980
Like like it's one thing if you're just gonna like gobble the glizzy like that

1254
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:10,300
When you dip it in water first like, I don't know now it just feels worse, you know

1255
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:13,660
Like it just it feels wrong

1256
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:21,020
I think I'm a little on protein so I'll take some of these mats. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1257
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,940
I will

1258
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,300
Up there is a lot of protein

1259
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:33,580
This four-corner. Thank you. Thank you darlin. Thank you darlin

1260
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:47,020
Like

1261
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:49,020
I always see those and I'm just like I

1262
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:52,140
I don't think I can do that because then I don't know the competitive eating makes

1263
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:59,980
Eating not fun. Oh my god. Yeah. No, you skip over the best part of eating which is enjoying your food

1264
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:08,860
You know like it feels very much like I don't know then why eat, you know

1265
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:15,100
I like putting things next to each other

1266
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:21,820
Oh no, oh no, except when it doesn't match up like that. Uh, oh

1267

01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,360
It's inflating. Oh, I haven't been doing squats. Ah

1386
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:50,480
You're saying I stopped doing squats. I was like, hmm, but then I looked over and I was like, oh, I'm kind of kind of low

1459
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,040

1461
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,640
It's like

1462
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:14,080
It's like I don't even know how to go on without her bros. I don't even know what am I gonna do

1463
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,840
Who am I gonna text every morning and every evening?

1464
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,440
Who am I gonna wish who am I gonna say I love you to?

1465
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:24,160
What am I gonna do with my life now?

1466
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:26,640
Without mercy, there's nothing

1467
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,280
There's no point to anything

1468
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,240
She is the point. She's our scissors

1469
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:39,600
She is the point. She is the inciting action. She is everything. We are just ken

1470
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:45,360
She is everything. What are we? Oh, shit. I'm gonna die. What am I without her?

1471
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Might as well be dead

1472
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:56,800
Might as well be dead if I can't be with the beautiful wonderful queen mercy if I can't be with her

1473
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,800
Maybe maybe maybe it is best to go on to that sweet good night

1474
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,280
Okay, she's back

1475
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:17,200
I'm dying. Oh no. Oh no

1476
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,440
I lost my nails

1477
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,600
Oh

1478
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:46,560
You know like my press on nails I did earlier today. Yeah. Yeah, they're so cute. How did you lose them?

1479
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,200
I lost two nails

1480
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,760
Oh

1481
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:58,080
I don't know where they went. I remember walking upstairs. Okay senpai

1482
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:06,000
I was walking upstairs and then I remember I'm not wearing a shirt

1483
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:14,560
And then I heard footsteps and I was like, no, we can't let mama or papa see me like this

1484
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,560
I ran down

1485
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,560
wore my shirt

1486
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,720
They can't know they can't know

1487
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:27,760
And then like I was just like, oh, I'm so tired because I think papa

1488
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:30,080
Papa

1489
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,080
Took the bottom the downstairs

1490
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:38,320
Bathroom I had to go up the stairs like two sets of stairs and I was like

1491
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:45,040
I think I'm gonna die because I did so many squats

1492
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:52,400
I went to the idle meeting and then I looked at my hand. I was like

1493
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,120
Two of them are gone

1494
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,920
Wait, did the other ones go?

1495
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,040
Oh my god

1496
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:08,000
So then I was like spent a little bit going where'd they go? Where'd they fucking go?

1497
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:15,040
Well, I was more concerned. I thought you lost them in like well at the idle meeting and I was like, how

1498
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:20,560
How did you lose? How did you lose them at the idle meeting? I don't know

1499
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:27,520
Anyways, I'm gonna peel these nails off because clearly they have a very not great glue

1500
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:35,040
So they were so cute. They were so cute and then and then I was like, what the hell they just don't last

1501
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,800
It happens, but they were so cute

1502
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,760
like

1503
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,760
Oh

1504
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:52,080
I can't believe it died while I was paused this game doesn't pause

1505
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,480
This game does not pause. They do not stop for anybody

1506
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,840
Don't take these oh god, oh god

1507
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:14,000
Welcome to my hell welcome to my dark and twisted mind

1508
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,760
Ah

1509
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,360
Okay, I will upgrade these two

1510
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:27,440
We try back in a baby back at it again a crispy fucking cream

1511
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,280
Oh

1512
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:40,240
Yeah, don't worry me in the sun pies. We were completely normal. We didn't do anything crazy or weird

1513
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,880
We were very normal. What were you doing?

1514
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:45,520
Nothing. What were you doing?

1515

01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,520

1517
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:11,520
No, no, no all of chat knows what I say when I'm lying

1518
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,600
Oh

1519
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,840
It's like you can't hide things for me

1520
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:28,880
No, we were just we were grieving that you died in game, you know, but we were normal about it

1521
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:34,720
She's so mischievous. She's so mischievous

1522
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,520
It's like I don't trust her but I do

I just love being a little shit. What can I say?

1524
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:52,000
There's nothing more satisfying in life than being a brat, you know, it's true

1525
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,520
I want to be a brat a lot of the times

1526
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:58,240
It's really fun. Like

1527
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:03,440
It's so it's so fun being disobedient. Like it's so fun

1528
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:09,760
Being a little shit like do you ever you know that meme where it's like do you ever want to just go like ape shit?

1529
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,760

01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,120
That's old

1531
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:22,560
It's not that old it's like old internet terms sure, but like it's not that

You mean like what they call hags?

1536
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:44,800
Yeah, I don't like the term christmas cake because I feel like it's so rude

1537
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:54,560
It is it is it's very loud, but it also implies that you're not fucking looking forward to that christmas cake all fucking year

1538
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,800

01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:22,640
I think we're gonna make it guys I've squatted 100 times

1593
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,640
My thighs are insane. Shit my paprika

1595
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:40,720
Yeah, do you know you?

1596
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,280
Cutest scissors in the world

1597
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,920
Scissors I barely even know her

1598
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,320

1599
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,400
Oh, yeah

1600
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:15,280
Like your bunny ears and my scissors match and then you're like big hair

1601
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,080
Your hair

1602
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:20,160
hair speakers

1603
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,280
My hair vents so I can breathe

1604
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:28,560
Wait, no, I kind of like hair speakers better because I'm so fucking loud

1605
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Girl you just added to the lore

01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:44,320
That's how I'm so loud. Oh shit. I'm fucking dying again. No, no, no

1607
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:51,680
Don't let them take you away from me. Not again. Not again. I was only two days alive man. No

1608
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,560
My fat

1609
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:10,480
My fat reserves. I'm just burning calories

1610
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:14,960
Not enough calories. I got so much dang cars, but not enough protein

1611
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,320
Just like I'm just eat the ham

1612
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:36,960
Yeah, I'm doing I'm doing the keto diet takoyaki where I just eat the fillings

1613
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,280
Yeah

1614
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,520

1615
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:43,680
No, no, no

1616
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,840

But like no the problem is I'm a try hard girl

1620
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:02,000
That's the problem. The problem is I don't want to die. I'm like I can hold it

1621
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,560
No

1622
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:08,160
Don't hold it let it out

1623
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:13,040
Let me let me let me let me just set up. Let me just let me just let me just set it up, you know

Some meats and stuff for me to come back to so I won't die terribly

01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,320

Serenity is my best friend who

1651
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:07,300
We are having a mayhem time right now trying to eat all these dang takoyaki's and trying not to die

1652
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:14,180
We're just doing our best. We are we're struggling. We're fighting for our lives right now

1653
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:17,860
Then you have to do squats. We were doing squats earlier

1654
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:22,660
Like real squats and then died

1655
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:24,340
Low energy

1656
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:30,660
Well, I can die you can can you die from low energy? I think so eat you can't you don't die from low energy

1657
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:33,060
Seriously, I was at zero energy

1658
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:40,980
You know what this means we can abuse the calories we can abuse our caloric intake

1659
01:45:43,140 --> 01:45:45,140
Okay

1660
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:47,620
Oh

1661
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:04,260
Sure

1662
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:18,580
Only nice things to say about everyone's favorite mother, you know

1663
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:21,060
she reads in

1664
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:22,740
but um

1665
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:24,740
You know my fairbie mask, right?

1666
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:28,900
No, you didn't did you wear it with the the egg man?

1667
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:32,100
I was having one of those nights. Yeah

1668
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:34,580
No

1669
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:37,540
This is like

1670
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:40,820
Weird black look too

1671
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:43,780
Oh my god, too. Holy shit

1672
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:47,220
But yeah

1673
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:52,500
I know exactly what you did

1674
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:58,500
I was just being in a little freak, you know

1675
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:04,420

1676
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:14,100

Okay, okay, okay, let's grab all these

1678
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:22,020
Yeah, some ham in there

1679
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:27,460
Like the meat texture is really nice like it's all rendered so good

1680
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:32,340
Girl, we are living. We're about to get oh fuck

1681
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:36,500
We've got so many peppermints

1682
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:42,660
We're about to fucking which by the way, I think would taste probably freaking awful. Oh discussing

1683
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:48,100
Bless you

1684
01:47:52,580 --> 01:47:58,740
I get excited around you too. Oh, that's so cute though. Always love serenity my bestie

I love you too

1688
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:24,660
Thank you for the five it wasn't egg man, but she did have the

1689
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:28,500
It's gonna send her arm strong. Thank you. I see

1690
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:37,540
Is this is I want to say this but you haven't changed like

1691
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:51,540
Yeah

1692
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:54,500
Yeah, I'm still the same cringe bitch

1693
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:06,980
You you haven't either you're still the most hardworking delightful girl that I've fallen in love with

1694
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:12,340
And that sometimes are so lucky to have

1695
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:16,100
Stop it. You make me blush

1696
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:18,100
Oh

1697
01:49:33,940 --> 01:49:35,940
Look at all these cucumbers

1698
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:39,940
I know what did they even do? I haven't actually experimented what they do

1699
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:43,700
I don't they don't give protein. That's for sure

1700
01:49:44,660 --> 01:49:51,380
They for sure don't give us any of the protein. I'll take all the cucumbers and and do an experiment

1701
01:49:55,780 --> 01:50:01,060
I feel like they make it so it's easier to eat so you can eat multiple of them

1702
01:50:01,780 --> 01:50:04,500
I think it's it's go carbs look like it's going up

1703
01:50:06,740 --> 01:50:11,540
Maybe oh our carbs what stops me from overeating

1704
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:22,580
The vegan taco yaki the best vegan taco yaki in town gosh, I really want to try taco yaki like

1705
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:25,300
real vegan taco yaki

1706
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:31,140
It can't be hard to make I feel like the only hard part is the ball is the grill, right?

1707
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:36,660
Well, no because the sauce is the type of um mayonnaise if I

1708
01:50:37,460 --> 01:50:42,020
Well vegan mayonnaise is really easy to get it's the same price as regular mayonnaise. So that's easy

1709
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:50,260
Then yeah, it shouldn't be too hard because the the batter itself is just the type of pancake batter

1710
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:52,740
Oh, she's my fat

1711
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:55,220
Oh, no

1712
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:56,980
I need that cheese

1713
01:50:56,980 --> 01:50:58,740
Oh my god

1714
01:50:58,740 --> 01:51:01,380
Somebody get her the cheese

1715
01:51:02,420 --> 01:51:05,060
On heat up. Thanks. Oh cheese up here

1716
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:09,300
Take your cheese as well

1717
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:11,940
Yes, take take take take

1718
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:15,220
I feel like pork would also give good fat

1719
01:51:17,060 --> 01:51:19,060
I'm like when did all my protein die?

1720
01:51:19,940 --> 01:51:20,900
I know

1721
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:25,140
Wait overeating. What do you mean overeating? I'm starving

1722
01:51:27,540 --> 01:51:29,860
I did not have my piggy fill. Thank you

1723
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:34,500
I really have to stop calling it that

1724
01:51:42,260 --> 01:51:46,260
Like I hope you I hope everyone knows this isn't a bit. This is just how I talk

1725
01:51:57,220 --> 01:52:01,620
Two candies which means we can eat our fill and not die

1726
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:04,580
I'm piggy fill finally

1727
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:12,100
No, let me eat the final peppermint

1728
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:15,940
Oh my god, oh my lord

Get everybody in there. Don't care about what we get. We just put it all in

1739
01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:03,860
Fuck out in the cheese

1740
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:17,220

1747
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:06,820
Oh god, oh god, that was nothing

1748
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:13,620
Oh, did you see that though? We were so in sync mind meld

1749
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:16,580

It's like literally are we like trapped in a chair or something?

1757
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:56,020
Yeah, yeah, this is like I've never seen the movie saw

1758
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:03,300
This is our sawchap. This is our saw health for ever eating

1759
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:11,940
He's like would you like to play a game? It's like yeah, we love games

1760
01:55:14,580 --> 01:55:19,460
Oh god, could you okay? Hold on. I need a saw movie where they put like

1761
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:24,180
Influences, but I need like, you know the brain rot influencers

1762
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:33,060
I need the ones who are like by my cryptocurrency by my cryptocurrency. Wow

1763
01:55:36,580 --> 01:55:38,580
Are you single?

1764
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:40,580
Oh

1765
01:55:56,020 --> 01:56:00,100
It's like about to like get get sawed and it goes like wood

1766
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:04,100
What would jake saw do

1767
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:10,980
If you flirted with him, what how would he even respond? I don't know. I think I've tell us to shut up or be like, okay

1768
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:12,260
You know what?

1769
01:56:12,260 --> 01:56:14,260
Just just rip off their mouths

1770
01:56:14,980 --> 01:56:17,300
They're they're they're tricky as gone

1771
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:23,460
So what if I could fix him? What if I can fix it? I don't think you can fix anyone

1772
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:28,100
Mom that sounded so mean

1773
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:36,740
I

1774
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:51,860
You can't fix

1775
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:56,980
Just me in the background girl, I don't think you can fix yourself

1776
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:06,100
Oh

1777
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:21,060
When you're too broken and you can't even be fixed

1778
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:29,940
Oh my god

1779
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:36,100
That too

1780
01:57:36,100 --> 01:57:38,740
For the first time ever the fat problem is happening

1781
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:42,020
Why are

1782
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:44,020
Why are we fat?

1783
01:57:45,140 --> 01:57:47,540
No, we're lacking the fat. Why are we?

1784
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:53,940
It's like we're out like one of those reality tv shows and they're like, oh my god. You're so skinny and we're over here

1785
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:58,020
Eating like our body weight in balls and we're like, I know

1786
01:57:58,980 --> 01:58:00,980
I don't want to be

1787
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:02,980
Oh

1788
01:58:11,860 --> 01:58:15,700
I don't know I'm dying. I've got 30 seconds to live

1789
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:25,940
We're just shoveling food in our mouths and we're just like, I don't know. I don't know why we're so thin. Help. Help. Help. I'm dying

1790
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:29,540
I just keep doing squats and eating

1791
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:33,220
I said

1792
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:35,540
Thank you. He's hot. Oh die you

1793
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:38,100
certified

1794
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:40,100
All consumers I'm out

1795
01:58:40,660 --> 01:58:42,660
You're right

1796
01:58:42,660 --> 01:58:49,140
You say you say certified and I have just Kendrick Lamar brain rot. So I was about to sing not like us

1797
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:53,220
It's like it's like a fucking calling car now

1798
01:58:53,380 --> 01:59:02,500
I love my brain rot bunny girl

1799
01:59:13,860 --> 01:59:19,300
I'm the worst kind of brand. Oh shit. I have no protein. I don't even remember why I put in these balls

1800
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:22,340
Take some of these balls

1801
01:59:22,980 --> 01:59:28,260
Take my balls. I take the balls. I take out the balls and I put the balls in my mouth

1802
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:37,400
I don't remember this in the Mario movie

1803
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:55,060
We should

1804
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:04,580
I have a day off tomorrow so I can rest my voice from like I knew this would happen

1805
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:07,860
You know, I like knew it would happen

1806
02:00:09,620 --> 02:00:16,740
I should have done that. I should have been smart like you. I'm not I am I am but a fool. I am but the fool

1807
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:21,380
My protein badge

1808
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:26,900
Oh my god, I'm about to die again. No

1809
02:00:28,420 --> 02:00:31,060
Don't don't do this. Don't let them take you

1810
02:00:31,940 --> 02:00:33,940
Don't let them take you away

1811
02:00:38,100 --> 02:00:41,700
I need that's a fast death. That was a super fast death. Hold on

1812
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:44,500
Gotta get my metabolism up

1813
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:47,060
Or my squats up

1814
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:49,700
I gotta do my squats up. Yeah

1815
02:00:50,260 --> 02:00:55,300
Yeah, squats are pretty good. They take out like a lot of calories

1816
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:05,620
Squats up so that we can take the calories because I keep on getting full too fast

1817
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:09,140
And not enough time

1818
02:01:10,820 --> 02:01:13,860
Too full not enough squatting happening like

1819
02:01:14,660 --> 02:01:19,860
Like for some reason we're like, oh, I gotta rest my tummy is so full and it's like, um

1820
02:01:21,140 --> 02:01:23,140
We are literally dying otherwise

1821
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:27,460
I didn't say you could get a break silly

1822
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:31,380
Eat more

1823
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:38,020
This is this is like actually torture like what is the goal? Why are we dying? Why do we have to do squats?

1824
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:46,260
We gotta do squats so we can eat more. Uh, here. I'll give us like a map hat like over analysis of this thing

1825
02:01:48,420 --> 02:01:51,140
Clearly we're being held against our will and some

1826
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:53,140
fucked up

1827
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:55,140
takoyaki eating

1828
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:57,140
restaurant and

1829
02:01:57,140 --> 02:02:04,660
We're criminals. So this is our punishment. We're but monsters and cogs to

1830
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:12,260
To the regime, you know, but that's just a theory a game theory. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching

1831
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:14,760
Don't forget to like and subscribe if you like the channel

1832
02:02:16,180 --> 02:02:21,300
I don't actually know. I never watch map hat in my life. No, you got it right. That's what he said

1833
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:28,820
I'm not you pass you and I'm about to die. He says all of these verbatim word for word

1834
02:02:29,220 --> 02:02:31,220
Oh

1835
02:02:34,020 --> 02:02:37,060
It's like why are we tackling? Why are we yaki?

1836
02:02:38,900 --> 02:02:42,660
We tackle to yaki we yaki to tackle

1837
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:49,140
Half of these aren't over half of these aren't even tackle yakis

1838
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:54,100
I can't turn these what's what the what's what this?

1839
02:02:55,060 --> 02:02:58,500
What oh sometimes it glitches out for me to want to dance and let me

1840
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:05,860
It's just being kind of kind of being rude being rude. Let me eat

1841
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:11,700
It's like no just star just star

1842
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:15,780
It's like this this is it

1843
02:03:20,260 --> 02:03:22,260
This is the final frontier

1844
02:03:24,340 --> 02:03:27,540
Actually burning more calories is pretty good

1845
02:03:29,300 --> 02:03:33,860
Yeah, do we do we keep our levels? Yes, we do

1846
02:03:36,900 --> 02:03:38,900
We do

1847
02:03:40,660 --> 02:03:42,660
My goodness, I'm so coffee

1848
02:03:43,300 --> 02:03:49,300
What's cause I had I had a milkshake earlier. That was a terrible idea. By the way, I get really flummy

1849
02:03:50,580 --> 02:03:52,020
Same

1850
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:58,900
Apparently I was my journey. Whoa. She taught me this apparently, but oh apparently um

1851
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:04,500
That's just what dairy does to you. So like if you're ever doing like a karaoke or something

1852
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:07,140
You should never have dairy before

1853
02:04:08,980 --> 02:04:10,980
I was like, oh my gosh, I feel like I'm dying

1854
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:18,900
Which sucks because I am a girl who loves her sweet little treats and um

1855
02:04:19,620 --> 02:04:22,100
Oh god, should I just fuck the sauce?

1856
02:04:23,380 --> 02:04:27,220
But yeah, I love sweet little treats and it's like a reward, you know, oh god

1857
02:04:30,980 --> 02:04:32,980
I mean it's like a reward

1858
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:38,820
It's cuz like I was like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I can have myself a little treat today

1859
02:04:40,820 --> 02:04:44,180
I was like, I have like my nails done and everything

1860
02:04:44,660 --> 02:04:46,660
Whoo

1861
02:04:47,300 --> 02:04:52,180
I'm gonna get myself like a little treat because I'm hanging out with my bestie

1862
02:04:55,540 --> 02:04:59,860
And little did I know that I would be dying with my bestie

1863
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:04,500
What flavor milkshake was it? Uh, orange cream's a call

1864
02:05:05,140 --> 02:05:07,140
Oh

1865
02:05:09,940 --> 02:05:12,660
What's your what's your go-to ice cream like a

1866
02:05:13,060 --> 02:05:14,260
um

1867
02:05:14,260 --> 02:05:16,260
ice cream truck order

1868
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:20,500
If they have like cotton candy or some like weird flavor, so I usually get the weird flavor

1869
02:05:21,860 --> 02:05:24,980
Like butterscotch or or or like flowers

1870
02:05:25,860 --> 02:05:27,860
Butterscotch is so good

1871
02:05:29,300 --> 02:05:31,300
I guess usually my

1872
02:05:32,180 --> 02:05:34,180
My go-to

1873
02:05:36,740 --> 02:05:41,620
But like it's usually like like cotton candy, which is just like a very sugary taste

1874
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:46,340
Cotton candy is good

1875
02:05:48,100 --> 02:05:54,900
It's interesting because I know I know like we have different ice creams

1876
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:59,860
But like oh shit, why did I do that? Why did I do that? I shouldn't have done that

1877
02:05:59,860 --> 02:06:03,380
Why did I why did I flip them all just grab them don't worry

1878
02:06:04,660 --> 02:06:07,300
I was zoning out. I was so I just wanted to flip the ball

1879
02:06:07,940 --> 02:06:09,940
She's like we just wanted to flip

1880
02:06:10,260 --> 02:06:16,340
Oh god, I'm not squatting. I'm just flipping balls left and right. I'm not my head is not in the game

1881
02:06:16,660 --> 02:06:18,660
Her ass is not gaming

1882
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:23,540
Don't worry. We can finish these balls. Look at that. We got him. We did it

1883
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:33,780
It's just zoned out, you know, this is like Korean barbecue all over again

1884
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:37,460
I'll go in because I like being the one who cooks and then I'll just

1885
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:40,740
Put on too much meat and then nobody can finish it

1886
02:06:43,380 --> 02:06:47,860
Everyone's like too full and then we gotta sneak into the bathroom

1887
02:06:49,860 --> 02:06:52,900
Okay, what was the craziest thing you've ever done for an all you can eat?

1888
02:06:54,580 --> 02:06:58,580
Like okay to to escape the charge. Yeah

1889
02:07:00,660 --> 02:07:04,660
Okay, okay, so um, I

1890
02:07:08,980 --> 02:07:12,980
I took so I have this cute bag with me, right?

1891
02:07:14,420 --> 02:07:17,380
So I I told like a bunch of

1892
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:24,900
Oh, I shouldn't say it like this. Um, I gotta say it in that a suspicious way

1893
02:07:25,780 --> 02:07:27,780
Uh-huh, uh-huh

1894
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:30,100
I

1895
02:07:30,260 --> 02:07:34,500
Placed all of the food in my mouth

1896
02:07:37,540 --> 02:07:42,260
And then I went to the butt because there was a lot so I put food in my mouth

1897
02:07:42,580 --> 02:07:44,180
But I also

1898
02:07:44,180 --> 02:07:48,500
Put some in my purse and napkins and then I ran to the bathroom

1899
02:07:50,580 --> 02:07:52,580
For seeing the T. You know

1900
02:07:53,460 --> 02:07:57,940
Because I couldn't we couldn't take the food with us. Yeah, we weren't allowed

1901
02:07:59,060 --> 02:08:06,420
So, yeah, that's this that's I think the craziest was was that to to properly dispose

1902
02:08:07,140 --> 02:08:08,980
of the food

1903
02:08:08,980 --> 02:08:10,980
of the Korean barbecue

1904
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:18,100
I think the craziest thing I ever did was like throwing up

1905
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:22,580
Throw it up and went back for more

1906
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:30,500
That's real shit though. That's real shit. You're just puking rallying. That's different. That's a party girl thing

1907
02:08:30,900 --> 02:08:32,900
And the the other friends were like

1908
02:08:34,100 --> 02:08:36,100
We're like, okay

1909
02:08:36,820 --> 02:08:38,820
I'm gonna go

1910
02:08:38,900 --> 02:08:40,900
shit it out

1911
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:43,700
And then we'll make some room

1912
02:08:44,260 --> 02:08:46,260
No, it's just things too long

1913
02:08:47,220 --> 02:08:49,380
They were like my stomach hurts. We're going now

1914
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:53,060
No

1915
02:08:53,940 --> 02:08:58,500
I didn't even I don't even think that's crazy. I think that's pretty crazy. I don't know

1916
02:09:00,580 --> 02:09:02,580
I don't know if this says anything about me

1917
02:09:03,940 --> 02:09:11,300
I don't know if I'm just outing myself right now, but like, I don't know. That's not like crazy crazy. That's pretty like that's real, you know

1918
02:09:11,700 --> 02:09:13,700
Oh

1919
02:09:13,700 --> 02:09:18,740
All you can eat is good when the charge is $30 plus per person. I'm I am like

1920
02:09:19,220 --> 02:09:22,100
No, I can rally any day of the week

1921
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:25,300

02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:27,860
It's it's the woo girl, you know motto

1923
02:09:28,260 --> 02:09:32,980
It's every girl that you meet drunk in the bathroom. We we're just we're just like that

1924
02:09:32,980 --> 02:09:39,380
We're gonna puke rally cheer each other on for it. Hold back each other's hair. Like that's what we do, baby

1925
02:09:39,620 --> 02:09:41,620
Oh my gosh, it's rola

1926
02:09:51,780 --> 02:09:54,100
We're suffering this game is hard

1927
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:59,220
For hamster said it was like a calm game. That was a lie

1928
02:10:00,820 --> 02:10:03,540
Well, professor hamster never said it was a calm game. Wait, what?

1929
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:07,700
Professor hamster just said I think you would like this game

1930
02:10:09,060 --> 02:10:14,500
When they're not wrong professor hamster is not wrong. I very much like this game

1931
02:10:21,220 --> 02:10:23,220
Tackle yucky torture sim is real

1932
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:32,740
Welcome to the tackle yucky torture sim. We eat squat and eat again

1933
02:10:32,980 --> 02:10:35,860
Yeah, earlier we were squatting real

1934
02:10:37,300 --> 02:10:39,300
Real not fake

1935
02:10:39,780 --> 02:10:46,180
We're squatting with with our tackle yucky eaters. We stopped. We could not we could not continue after half an hour

1936
02:10:46,260 --> 02:10:52,340
We were like if we can't do this anymore. Okay, but half an hour of doing that straight is pretty fucking crazy

1937
02:10:52,340 --> 02:10:54,500
We we we we we rule

1938
02:10:54,740 --> 02:10:56,740
Oh

1939
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:03,460
I'm stealing yours

1940
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:14,900
Instantly takes them all

1941
02:11:24,820 --> 02:11:26,820
We such picky eating

1942
02:11:37,620 --> 02:11:42,100
We actually can't die in this game. Yes, we die frequently

1943
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:53,060
Look at my protein

1944
02:11:53,060 --> 02:11:56,020
In fact, why are we why are we losing them?

1945
02:11:58,980 --> 02:12:00,980
I don't know

1946
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:08,500
We're not even we're just sitting we're not even doing anything we exist and we lose protein and fat

1947
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:15,220
We are not gym bros. We are not we are not boys who go to the gym

1948
02:12:18,020 --> 02:12:21,940
Okay, okay, okay, let me bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop you

1949
02:12:22,580 --> 02:12:24,580
Put you in protein

1950
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:27,220
protein

1951
02:12:28,420 --> 02:12:30,420
I can't believe we can get crab arms

1952
02:12:32,420 --> 02:12:37,220
No, no, no, I can't be full. I have six fat. I can't be full

1953
02:12:43,860 --> 02:12:47,140
No, it's fine. I couldn't imagine playing this with more people

1954
02:12:47,700 --> 02:12:52,100
Wow, I think it would be chaotic. It would be so it'd be so insane

1955
02:12:54,020 --> 02:12:56,020
And guess what I think we're gonna do it

1956
02:12:56,980 --> 02:12:58,980
Yeah, I feel like we can do it

1957
02:13:00,340 --> 02:13:05,300
I'm gonna see I believe in us. I think we could do anything ever. I don't have enough skills

1958
02:13:07,780 --> 02:13:09,780
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

1959
02:13:10,020 --> 02:13:12,020
I don't like this

1960
02:13:12,260 --> 02:13:17,220
How many get how many people does this game support? I think four four. Yeah four at a time

1961
02:13:17,460 --> 02:13:20,980
Yeah, see so one person can sit here and one person can sit at the end over there

1962
02:13:24,180 --> 02:13:26,420
It's like table tops and rolls except

1963
02:13:27,220 --> 02:13:33,140
Not at all like that game. Yeah, each person will like have pretty much the same appearance since we're in uh

1964
02:13:33,140 --> 02:13:35,140
Hmm

1965
02:13:36,740 --> 02:13:42,100
Yeah, we each get our little seat our little our little solo play but like

1966
02:13:43,380 --> 02:13:45,380
But where's the fun in that?

1967
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:49,220
Oh my gosh, I'm about to fucking die again

1968
02:13:50,420 --> 02:13:56,020
Like yeah, you can be lonely. Oh, why would you be lonely when you can come back? It's a party. Yeah

1969
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:59,780
You want a party alone?

1970
02:14:00,740 --> 02:14:04,340
Why party alone when you can party with some cute girl?

1971
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:13,860
I think like you would go alone to just unlock the

1972
02:14:15,460 --> 02:14:17,460
The extra stuff

1973
02:14:18,020 --> 02:14:21,700
That would be smart. That would be like the smart thing to do

1974
02:14:22,580 --> 02:14:24,580
But guess what? I'm not smart at all

1975
02:14:25,460 --> 02:14:29,940
I'm I'm a dumb girl. I'm dumb girl. I'm dumb girl who has fun

1976
02:14:34,020 --> 02:14:38,980
Girls who girl girl and girls who don't go wait, you know

1977
02:14:44,500 --> 02:14:51,940
Wait, no stop stop why am I malnutritioned? I'm I'm not malnutrition. I'm dumb as fuck boy

1978
02:14:55,380 --> 02:14:57,380
I

1979
02:15:01,620 --> 02:15:03,620
Start spinning

1980
02:15:08,660 --> 02:15:13,620
This is the peppermint. Yeah, that one's the peppermint you can have it. Thank you

1981
02:15:14,660 --> 02:15:16,660
You can have your peppy mint

1982
02:15:17,780 --> 02:15:19,780
Can I have a peppermint?

1983
02:15:19,780 --> 02:15:21,780
You can have a peppermint

1984
02:15:21,940 --> 02:15:27,140
This is gonna suck. Come on, squat faster

1985
02:15:29,060 --> 02:15:37,540
Okay, two beef. Beef gives a little bit of fat. What gives us more fat? What are like fatty fluids?

1986
02:15:39,620 --> 02:15:44,100
I feel like pork could be fatty. I think cheese is fat. That would make sense

1987
02:15:44,260 --> 02:15:46,260
And

1988
02:15:48,020 --> 02:15:54,660
Protein is it has to be the meat the meats, right? Oh steak a thousand percent gives protein

1989
02:15:57,780 --> 02:16:01,060
Okay, it's like it's no longer takoyaki

1990
02:16:02,980 --> 02:16:09,380
Now we're like like going into like the caloric and take we can have you know, we're like really we're mapping it out

1991
02:16:15,060 --> 02:16:18,180
It's like I have to I have to have this much to survive

1992
02:16:20,020 --> 02:16:23,060
I need okay if I want to eat this many balls

1993
02:16:23,060 --> 02:16:26,020
I have to do this much these many squats

1994
02:16:26,740 --> 02:16:34,820
And this many full types and then I can have over 200 takoyaki in under three hours

1995
02:16:35,540 --> 02:16:37,540
Fuck

1996
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:40,500
Fuck

1997
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:45,860
I'm gonna bomb. I'm gonna go. I'll take I'll take the bird ones

1998
02:16:48,820 --> 02:16:50,820
And I'll flip over some for you

1999
02:16:52,740 --> 02:16:56,740
Okay, all of these will be for you. Oh, thank you. Yes

2000
02:16:57,780 --> 02:16:59,780
Look how look at my fat and protein

2001
02:17:00,580 --> 02:17:02,580

2002
02:17:03,300 --> 02:17:07,060
I'm there with you. Oh, but you're on day like five you're living

2003
02:17:08,340 --> 02:17:11,140
Well, what's the max that we live to eight?

2004
02:17:12,260 --> 02:17:15,220
I think you bought to eight. I got to like six maybe

2005
02:17:15,540 --> 02:17:17,540

2006
02:17:18,900 --> 02:17:20,900
There we go

2007
02:17:21,300 --> 02:17:26,260
About the second my heart starts beating and I know the grim reapers at my door

2008
02:17:26,740 --> 02:17:31,540
knocking waiting for me to slip up and not eat a delicious piece of takoyaki

2009
02:17:32,100 --> 02:17:34,100
Look it's real fun

2010
02:17:34,740 --> 02:17:37,220
It's it's not looking good. It's not looking good

2011
02:17:37,860 --> 02:17:44,260
It's not looking good 10 seconds to squat and I can't do it five three two one

2012
02:17:44,740 --> 02:17:46,740
It's over

2013
02:17:49,780 --> 02:17:51,780
I can't believe he took you away

2014
02:17:52,580 --> 02:17:54,580
The grim reaper took me

2015
02:17:55,380 --> 02:17:57,140
What the fuck

2016
02:17:57,140 --> 02:18:01,780
How like how very not girls girl of the grim reaper to do that to you

2017
02:18:02,820 --> 02:18:04,500
It was too late

2018
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:06,340
It was over

2019
02:18:06,340 --> 02:18:08,340
It was all ogre

2020
02:18:08,340 --> 02:18:10,340

Have you ever heard the shrek rap?

2026
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:36,900
No

2027
02:18:41,380 --> 02:18:44,900
I think I've been seeing like that level of derange

Yeah.

2066
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:26,920
A few calories.

2067
02:21:26,920 --> 02:21:28,920
Okay, okay, okay.

2068
02:21:28,920 --> 02:21:30,920
Suck it up.

2069
02:21:32,920 --> 02:21:33,920
Oh my god.

Thank you, fever.

2073
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:45,920
I was on the brink of this stuff, and now I'm alive, well and happy.

2074
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:47,920
Oh dang it.

2075
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:51,920
Nah, it's fine.

2076
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:56,920
We got, we're back to like almost full.

I know!

2079
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:02,920
We can live to see another day!

2080
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:07,920
We can be alive!

2081
02:22:08,920 --> 02:22:10,920
And squat more!

2082
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:12,920
Yay, yay squatting!

2083
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:15,920
At least we're not doing it in real life.

2084
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:17,920
Yeah, you know that idea?

2085
02:22:17,920 --> 02:22:20,920
Cause I thought it was gonna be like a comma game.

2086
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:26,920
Yeah, that was a terrible idea in hindsight.

2087
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:31,920
Cause I thought it would be a comma game and screaming.

2088
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:38,920
Literally like, yeah, I thought it was like, yeah, we'll probably like have,

2089
02:22:38,920 --> 02:22:43,920
probably have some time where we have to like just squat, squat like everyone's in a while.

2090
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:46,920
It's like every single second of our life.

2091
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:50,920
Like I didn't know it was gonna be this, this crazy.

2092
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:59,920
Cause in the moment you were like, yeah, we have to squat in the game so we can squat for real.

2093
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:02,920
I was like, huh?

2094
02:23:02,920 --> 02:23:04,920
Will you squat?

2095
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:08,920
Day seven, we've been here for a week.

02:23:08,920 --> 02:23:10,920

How much to become Mercy's chair?

2139
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:41,920

You're so spoiled.

2141
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:44,920
They are.

2142
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:46,920
It's a little Senpai.

2143
02:25:48,920 --> 02:25:50,920
Well, I have to eat.

2144
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:55,920

02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:00,920
Yes.

2147
02:26:00,920 --> 02:26:05,920
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

2148
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:10,920
I couldn't, I could potentially tell the secret.

2149
02:26:13,920 --> 02:26:16,920
Yeah, but like do Senpais get to know?

2150
02:26:16,920 --> 02:26:17,920
You know, like doing?

2151
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:22,920
They could get to know, but like at the same time just like, hmm, have you been good?

2152
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:24,920
Have they been good enough to know?

2153
02:26:24,920 --> 02:26:28,920
Do they get to know the fun little, the fun Mercy secret?

2154
02:26:28,920 --> 02:26:32,920
I'll, I'll, I'll mess, I'll message you on Discord right now what it was.

2155
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:35,920
And then you can, you can decide if they deserve to know.

2156
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:37,920
Ooh, I get to decide.

2157
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:38,920
Yeah.

2158
02:26:38,920 --> 02:26:40,920
I mean, Senpais happen pretty good.

2159
02:26:40,920 --> 02:26:42,920
When you were at idle meeting, they were pretty good.

2160
02:26:42,920 --> 02:26:43,920
Senpai!

2161
02:26:45,920 --> 02:26:46,920
Ugh, you know me.

2162
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:48,920
I'm fucking weak when it comes to chats.

2163
02:26:57,920 --> 02:26:58,920
Ooh.

2164
02:26:58,920 --> 02:26:59,920
Ahh!

2165
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:00,920
Ahh!

2166
02:27:10,920 --> 02:27:13,920
So, I mean like, okay.

2167
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:16,920
Real?

2168
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:18,920
Oh, they don't know.

2169
02:27:18,920 --> 02:27:20,920
They don't know that.

2170
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:22,920
Oh, wait, they don't know.

2171
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:31,920
Or do they?

2172
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:32,920
It didn't send.

2173
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:35,920
I, I hit shift and entered at the same time.

2174
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:52,920
I mean, I think, I, oh, this is hard.

2175
02:27:52,920 --> 02:27:53,920
This is hard.

2176
02:27:53,920 --> 02:28:07,920
Cause like, I, I probably would pay while this information and only tell in like a members only stream.

2177
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:09,920
Okay, I'll tell them in a members only stream.

2178
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:10,920
Yeah.

2179
02:28:12,920 --> 02:28:19,920
Cause if they want to know like the good secrets, they gotta, they gotta earn their way to the good secrets, you know?

2180
02:28:20,920 --> 02:28:21,920
We will remind you.

2181
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:23,920
You will have to remind me.

2182
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:30,920
I also think you should add in the little added question that I asked.

2183
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:33,920
I think you should let them know that story too.

2184
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:36,920
This is a magical girl.

2185
02:28:36,920 --> 02:28:37,920
Are you kidding me?

2186
02:28:37,920 --> 02:28:38,920
Are you kidding me?

2187
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:40,920
That shit was cute.

2188
02:28:40,920 --> 02:28:41,920
What?

2189
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:45,920
Actual cute girl shit.

2190
02:28:50,920 --> 02:28:52,920
Cutest girl in the whole world.

2191
02:28:55,920 --> 02:28:57,920
And sometimes they're going crazy.

2192
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:00,920
They're like, what secrets, what secrets do you know?

2193
02:29:02,920 --> 02:29:05,920
Meanwhile, I'm like, yeah, I'll keep my secrets.

2194
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:06,920
What secrets?

2195
02:29:16,920 --> 02:29:21,920
Are you really going to ask the mischievous bunny what you would like to hear the truth?

2196
02:29:21,920 --> 02:29:22,920
No!

2197
02:29:26,920 --> 02:29:28,920
I like seeing you guys squirm.

2198
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:31,920
She's more of a sadist than I am.

2199
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:36,920
I like being bully.

2200
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:38,920
I like being evil.

2201
02:29:42,920 --> 02:29:44,920
Did we just say eat at the same time?

2202
02:29:58,920 --> 02:30:00,920
This is like besties.

2203
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:02,920
It really is.

2204
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:07,920
This is not even over.

2205
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:09,920
We're like best friends.

2206
02:30:10,920 --> 02:30:15,920
The fact that we fucking eat at the same time.

2207
02:30:16,920 --> 02:30:17,920
It stinks.

2208
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:26,920
Yeah, do you and your bestie eat at the same time?

2209
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:27,920
I didn't think so.

2210
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:29,920
I didn't think so.

2211
02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:34,920
Put some ham in here.

2212
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:38,920
This one's so good.

2213
02:30:38,920 --> 02:30:40,920
Oh god, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying.

2214
02:30:40,920 --> 02:30:42,920
I'm out of your protein.

2215
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:47,920
I ate octopus.

2216
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:48,920
Okay, we're good, we're good.

2217
02:30:48,920 --> 02:30:50,920
Here's some eggs.

2218
02:30:50,920 --> 02:30:51,920
Oh, thank you.

2219
02:30:56,920 --> 02:30:59,920
It's because I can't eat fast enough.

2220
02:31:01,920 --> 02:31:03,920
You're on day eight.

2221
02:31:03,920 --> 02:31:04,920
Oh my god.

2222
02:31:05,920 --> 02:31:06,920
He survived.

2223
02:31:06,920 --> 02:31:09,920
I have so many cucumbers.

2224
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:13,920
It's cool, it's cool and unusual punishment.

2225
02:31:18,920 --> 02:31:20,920
Senpai, do you have a bestie?

2226
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:25,920
Oh, oh, Senpai, I hope so.

2227
02:31:25,920 --> 02:31:26,920
Too.

2228
02:31:26,920 --> 02:31:31,920
Oh, that would be really cute.

2229
02:31:31,920 --> 02:31:34,920
Can I drop the cucumbers off the table?

2230
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:36,920
Yeah, that's what I thought.

2231
02:31:36,920 --> 02:31:37,920
Technically.

2232
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:38,920
Throw them on the floor.

2233
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:40,920
I died.

2234
02:31:41,920 --> 02:31:42,920
That's okay.

2235
02:31:44,920 --> 02:31:46,920
Day eight is, is...

2236
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:50,920
Back in the game.

2237
02:31:50,920 --> 02:31:52,920
I like that death doesn't really matter.

2238
02:31:57,920 --> 02:31:59,920
Death doesn't matter.

2239
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:01,920
We get resurrected to eat more.

2240
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:05,920
They just bring, it's like Groundhog's Day.

2241
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:08,920
We wake up, we wake up in a different chair each time,

2242
02:32:08,920 --> 02:32:13,920
lost and confused, sweating, but hungry somehow, always hungry.

2243
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:17,920
Always hungry, always eating, always takoyaki-ing.

2244
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:19,920
Always takoyaki.

2245
02:32:20,920 --> 02:32:25,920
Never fully satisfied, just always takoyaki.

2246
02:32:27,920 --> 02:32:30,920
He's like, I got friends online that I'm a bit closer to.

2247
02:32:30,920 --> 02:32:34,920
We're not, we're not, we don't live in the same area, Senpai.

2248
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:38,920
Like Serenity and I, Destiny decided that we must stay apart.

2249
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:40,920
Yeah.

2250
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:45,920
But like one day, maybe one day, maybe the other.

2251
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:47,920
I hope so.

2252
02:32:48,920 --> 02:32:49,920
Same.

2253
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:53,920
Like when, when like money allows it and then I can get like, you know...

2254
02:32:56,920 --> 02:33:00,920
Oh my god, I am not cooking you so much food when I meet you.

2255
02:33:02,920 --> 02:33:03,920
I'm vegan, I'm vegan!

2256
02:33:03,920 --> 02:33:04,920
I'm vegan!

2257
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:05,920
No way!

2258
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:06,920
I won't die!

2259
02:33:06,920 --> 02:33:07,920
You won't die!

2260
02:33:12,920 --> 02:33:15,920
It's so hard because there's so many vegan places near me,

2261
02:33:15,920 --> 02:33:19,920
and I'm just like, oh, I'll be so good for you!

2262
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:22,920
There's a vegan bakery I'm next to!

2263
02:33:22,920 --> 02:33:23,920
Oh, seriously?

2264
02:33:24,920 --> 02:33:25,920
I love bakeries.

2265
02:33:26,920 --> 02:33:30,920
They smell good, but then most bakeries are like, you know, death.

2266
02:33:32,920 --> 02:33:34,920
Nah, this one's vegan.

2267
02:33:36,920 --> 02:33:38,920
I keep on eating the paprika!

2268
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:41,920
I don't know what paprika does.

2269
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:46,920
I think it's like cucumber where it's nothing.

2270
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:50,920
Stop trying to make me eat my veggie tater.

2271
02:33:51,920 --> 02:33:53,920
I can't hear veggies like this.

2272
02:33:56,920 --> 02:33:59,920
It's fucked up, I don't want to eat vegetables!

2273
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:07,920
They're saying, don't let me cook.

2274
02:34:10,920 --> 02:34:12,920
I'm not a bad chef.

2275
02:34:13,920 --> 02:34:16,920
What? No, you're cooking is good.

2276
02:34:18,920 --> 02:34:19,920
Sometimes.

2277
02:34:20,920 --> 02:34:23,920
You don't want to eat Mercy's cooking every day of the week?

2278
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:27,920
Yeah, why don't you want to eat, you know...

2279
02:34:29,920 --> 02:34:30,920
Yeah.

2280
02:34:31,920 --> 02:34:33,920
Have my cooking all the time.

2281
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:39,920
You don't think you're lucky enough to enjoy Mercy's cooking every day?

2282
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:41,920
What's wrong with you?

2283
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:43,920
Is it because of the takoyaki?

2284
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:46,920
Are you just tired of eating takoyaki every day?

2285
02:34:46,920 --> 02:34:48,920
Is that the hint that you're trying to give?

2286
02:34:48,920 --> 02:34:54,920
Are you trying to say you're tired of eating takoyaki mean for three months straight?

2287
02:34:54,920 --> 02:34:57,920
I would make a mean...

2288
02:35:00,920 --> 02:35:02,920
I would make a mean sandwich.

2289
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:07,920
Ooh, so flimmy!

2290
02:35:08,920 --> 02:35:09,920
I'm sorry.

2291
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:12,920
No, it's okay, I'm just so excited.

2292
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:18,920
I have no excuse for why I've been coughing so much.

2293
02:35:18,920 --> 02:35:20,920
I'm just like...

2294
02:35:20,920 --> 02:35:22,920
Milkshake was a terrible idea.

2295
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:27,920
Milkshake was a terrible idea.

2296
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:30,920
And I should be punished for my ideas.

2297
02:35:31,920 --> 02:35:33,920
No! No, you're kidding!

2298
02:35:34,920 --> 02:35:35,920
Your ideas are great!

2299
02:35:36,920 --> 02:35:38,920
Fuck anybody who thinks otherwise, I'll kill them!

2300
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:39,920
I'll kill them!

2301
02:35:39,920 --> 02:35:42,920
I'll watch the lights stay from their fucking eyes.

2302
02:35:42,920 --> 02:35:47,920
If anybody ever makes you think that your ideas aren't wonderful and amazing, I'll fucking watch.

2303
02:35:48,920 --> 02:35:54,920
I'll watch and enjoy every second that they cry and sob, waiting, trying to survive,

2304
02:35:54,920 --> 02:35:58,920
and I'm gonna force feed them every one of your fucking thoughts!

2305
02:36:00,920 --> 02:36:04,920
They can choke and savor every last bit of their fucking pathetic lives!

2306
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:07,920
I love her.

2307
02:36:08,920 --> 02:36:10,920
Oh my god, I love you too!

2308
02:36:14,920 --> 02:36:17,920
Trust me. Trust me, Senpai, we're crazy.

2309
02:36:18,920 --> 02:36:19,920
Yeah.

2310
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:29,920
We're so crazy.

2311
02:36:29,920 --> 02:36:31,920
I love being a crazy bitch with you.

2312
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:32,920
It's the best.

2313
02:36:32,920 --> 02:36:33,920
Okay.

2314
02:36:34,920 --> 02:36:37,920
I'll rip anyone limb from limb from you.

2315
02:36:38,920 --> 02:36:40,920
That's what besties do.

2316
02:36:40,920 --> 02:36:42,920
That's what besties do!

2317
02:36:44,920 --> 02:36:48,920
We rip and tear, baby. We rip and tear.

2318
02:36:52,920 --> 02:36:54,920
I know, I like this song a lot.

2319
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:07,920
Violence is always the answer.

2320
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:09,920
It is!

2321
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:13,920
I try not to do it, but it's usually always the answer.

2322
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:18,920
Because you're a good girl, you know?

2323
02:37:18,920 --> 02:37:20,920
You're like, nah.

2324
02:37:20,920 --> 02:37:22,920
You're about that slow-

2325
02:37:22,920 --> 02:37:23,920
How did I-

2326
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:25,920
I died!

2327
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:30,920
I'm after you, Takoyaki Hellman.

2328
02:37:30,920 --> 02:37:31,920
Okay.

2329
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:33,920
Which one should I do? Absorption.

2330
02:37:33,920 --> 02:37:37,920
Maybe absorption should be better, because god damn!

2331
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:41,920
We gotta really absorb all the Takoyaki right now.

2332
02:37:46,920 --> 02:37:49,920
Pour, pour and place an extra for ya.

2333
02:37:49,920 --> 02:37:50,920
Thank you.

2334
02:37:55,920 --> 02:37:57,920
Gotta get my calories up.

2335
02:37:57,920 --> 02:37:59,920
Gotta get, gotta get that.

2336
02:38:00,920 --> 02:38:02,920
Gotta get that boom boom pow.

2337
02:38:04,920 --> 02:38:05,920
Interesting.

2338
02:38:05,920 --> 02:38:06,920
You can eat-

2339
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:10,920
You can eat them without the sauce.

2340
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:11,920
Well, no.

2341
02:38:11,920 --> 02:38:17,920
You can eat like cucumber and paprika when you're kind of full.

2342
02:38:17,920 --> 02:38:18,920
Oh, okay.

2343
02:38:18,920 --> 02:38:19,920
So like-

2344
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:20,920
So maybe that's it?

2345
02:38:20,920 --> 02:38:22,920
They can be like filler?

2346
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:23,920
Maybe.

2347
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:27,920
Maybe if you need like to just-

2348
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:29,920
I don't know.

2349
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:31,920
I don't know why you would need to eat more.

2350
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:33,920
Why do we need to eat more?

2351
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:34,920
Why do we suffer?

2352
02:38:34,920 --> 02:38:36,920
Why do we suffer?

2353
02:38:38,920 --> 02:38:41,920
Why do we suffer with no candy?

2354
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:45,920
Literally not even a little bit of candy.

2355
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:47,920
Not even a little.

2356
02:38:47,920 --> 02:38:48,920
Oh, there it is!

2357
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:50,920
You spoke-

2358
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:52,920
Oh my god.

2359
02:38:52,920 --> 02:38:53,920
You heard me.

2360
02:38:53,920 --> 02:38:54,920
She heard me!

2361
02:38:54,920 --> 02:38:56,920
You spoke and it happened.

2362
02:38:56,920 --> 02:38:57,920
She was like,

2363
02:38:57,920 --> 02:39:00,920
I heard you were talking shit.

2364
02:39:00,920 --> 02:39:03,920
So I'm making like grand entrance.

2365
02:39:04,920 --> 02:39:05,920
And I'm over here like,

2366
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:06,920
I'm so sorry, Miss Candy.

2367
02:39:06,920 --> 02:39:09,920
I would like to formally apologize.

2368
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:11,920
I was talking shit.

2369
02:39:11,920 --> 02:39:13,920
And now I will get hit.

2370
02:39:18,920 --> 02:39:19,920
Bop, bop, bop.

2371
02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:20,920
Senpai!

2372
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:21,920
Senpai!

2373
02:39:21,920 --> 02:39:23,920
Whoa, fuck them up.

2374
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:28,920
Thank you for the two super chat.

2375
02:39:28,920 --> 02:39:29,920
Why are we still here?

2376
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:30,920
Just to suffer?

2377
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:31,920
Yes.

2378
02:39:31,920 --> 02:39:32,920
Yes.

2379
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:34,920
Senpai, you know,

2380
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:35,920
I'm gonna say it.

2381
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:38,920
You haven't eaten a single takoyaki

2382
02:39:38,920 --> 02:39:41,920
this whole time!

2383
02:39:46,920 --> 02:39:47,920
It's okay.

2384
02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:49,920
We're the takoyaki they want.

2385
02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:52,920
Oh, that's right.

2386
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:57,920
They just stayed in room for dessert.

2387
02:40:06,920 --> 02:40:08,920
I saw, cause Koa is not feeding us.

2388
02:40:08,920 --> 02:40:09,920
I'm so sorry.

2389
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:10,920
I'm so sorry.

2390
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:11,920
I'm so sorry.

2391
02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:12,920
Um, I think you meant,

2392
02:40:12,920 --> 02:40:14,920
you're not feeding her?

2393
02:40:14,920 --> 02:40:18,920
Um, like, I'm so sorry Senpai.

2394
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:21,920
You should be feeding her?

2395
02:40:22,920 --> 02:40:24,920
Excuse me?

2396
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:27,920
This is so fun.

2397
02:40:30,920 --> 02:40:31,920
It's like, I would,

2398
02:40:31,920 --> 02:40:34,920
I would totally let Senpai eat a takoyaki,

2399
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:35,920
but if I didn't click on them,

2400
02:40:35,920 --> 02:40:38,920
they would instantly be eaten.

2401
02:40:38,920 --> 02:40:40,920
Oh yeah, no, they would fucking destroy.

2402
02:40:45,920 --> 02:40:47,920
Just let us out of the cage.

2403
02:40:47,920 --> 02:40:49,920
I can't trust you.

2404
02:40:50,920 --> 02:40:52,920
Well, if they left out of the cage,

2405
02:40:52,920 --> 02:40:54,920
then how do we know they would stay

2406
02:40:54,920 --> 02:40:57,920
to enjoy all this delicious takoyaki?

2407
02:40:59,920 --> 02:41:00,920
Listen.

2408
02:41:02,920 --> 02:41:03,920
Don't trust them.

2409
02:41:03,920 --> 02:41:04,920
Don't trust them.

2410
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:07,920
The moment you leave, the door unlocked?

2411
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:10,920
No, no, take their little slimy fingers

2412
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:12,920
and, like, unlock it,

2413
02:41:12,920 --> 02:41:14,920
and then you're just there waiting outside

2414
02:41:14,920 --> 02:41:16,920
because you know they're gonna do it.

2415
02:41:16,920 --> 02:41:18,920
Oh my god, they're like dogs.

2416
02:41:18,920 --> 02:41:20,920
Oh my god.

2417
02:41:20,920 --> 02:41:23,920
If you leave the door open for just a second,

2418
02:41:23,920 --> 02:41:24,920
they're gonna bolt,

2419
02:41:24,920 --> 02:41:26,920
even though they have everything they need.

2420
02:41:26,920 --> 02:41:29,920
They have food, they have love.

2421
02:41:29,920 --> 02:41:32,920
Moment, the moment that door is open.

2422
02:41:32,920 --> 02:41:34,920
Woof, woof, woof, they're out of there.

2423
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:35,920
Exactly.

2424
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:36,920
I can't trust them.

2425
02:41:36,920 --> 02:41:38,920
That's why they gotta be on the leash all the time.

2426
02:41:38,920 --> 02:41:41,920
It's for their protection, honestly.

2427
02:41:42,920 --> 02:41:43,920
I mean...

2428
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:44,920
But it's okay.

2429
02:41:44,920 --> 02:41:46,920
I instructed the...

2430
02:41:46,920 --> 02:41:48,920
All this on Piest.

2431
02:41:48,920 --> 02:41:51,920
If anyone is running, we get the hammers.

2432
02:41:51,920 --> 02:41:52,920
And everyone...

2433
02:41:52,920 --> 02:41:54,920
There's, like, what, 200 and something

2434
02:41:54,920 --> 02:41:55,920
bones them human body?

2435
02:41:55,920 --> 02:41:57,920
Everyone gets one bone to break.

2436
02:41:57,920 --> 02:42:00,920
That's so fun.

2437
02:42:00,920 --> 02:42:03,920
I feel like that's so generous, right?

2438
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:06,920
And some of them are bigger, so, like, you get extra hits.

2439
02:42:06,920 --> 02:42:09,920
Oh my god, that's so fun, though.

2440
02:42:10,920 --> 02:42:13,920
Like, that's so pinatical, it is, like...

2441
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:15,920
I was like, why is...

2442
02:42:15,920 --> 02:42:18,920
What a fun time.

2443
02:42:18,920 --> 02:42:20,920
That would encourage...

2444
02:42:20,920 --> 02:42:21,920
That would encourage running, for me, honestly.

2445
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:23,920
I would convince people to run,

2446
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:25,920
just because, like, then I get a free hit.

2447
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:27,920
Does that seem to think about me?

2448
02:42:27,920 --> 02:42:29,920
I'm like, I mean...

2449
02:42:29,920 --> 02:42:31,920
I will pass my answer, actually.

2450
02:42:31,920 --> 02:42:32,920
I think...

2451
02:42:32,920 --> 02:42:33,920
I think that means...

2452
02:42:33,920 --> 02:42:35,920
I think something about me that I...

2453
02:42:35,920 --> 02:42:36,920
Um...

2454
02:42:36,920 --> 02:42:38,920
Um...

2455
02:42:38,920 --> 02:42:40,920
Um...

2456
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:42,920
Um...

2457
02:42:42,920 --> 02:42:44,920
Like, there's no candies inside me.

2458
02:42:44,920 --> 02:42:46,920
Yeah, the candies are your flesh.

2459
02:42:46,920 --> 02:42:49,920
Your organs.

2460
02:42:49,920 --> 02:42:51,920
Yeah, wait, you're so silly.

2461
02:42:51,920 --> 02:42:54,920
You're so silly, you're so full of stuff.

2462
02:42:54,920 --> 02:42:57,920
And you don't need all of your organs.

2463
02:42:57,920 --> 02:42:59,920
Like, I've stated this so many times.

2464
02:42:59,920 --> 02:43:00,920
You don't need all of them.

2465
02:43:00,920 --> 02:43:03,920
You're being selfish, hoarding all of them.

2466
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:04,920
You know?

2467
02:43:04,920 --> 02:43:06,920
You have two kidneys.

2468
02:43:06,920 --> 02:43:08,920
You don't need both.

2469
02:43:12,920 --> 02:43:14,920
See, how long can I say shit like this

2470
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:16,920
before it's not a bit anymore?

2471
02:43:16,920 --> 02:43:18,920
Before it's not a bit anymore?

2472
02:43:18,920 --> 02:43:20,920
What do you mean it was a bit?

2473
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:26,920
Oh no, I'm dying.

2474
02:43:32,920 --> 02:43:33,920
What do you mean it was a bit?

2475
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:34,920
Seriously.

2476
02:43:36,920 --> 02:43:38,920
Like, okay, but you know,

2477
02:43:38,920 --> 02:43:40,920
you can only do so many Google searches

2478
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:42,920
before you're like...

2479
02:43:42,920 --> 02:43:44,920
Before the FBI comes and goes,

2480
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:46,920
Hello, Serenity?

2481
02:43:46,920 --> 02:43:48,920
We'd like to talk to you about your Google searches.

2482
02:43:52,920 --> 02:43:54,920
Before my internet provider's like,

2483
02:43:54,920 --> 02:43:56,920
We're a little concerned

2484
02:43:56,920 --> 02:43:58,920
about what you've been searching up.

2485
02:43:58,920 --> 02:44:00,920
Why did you want to know

2486
02:44:00,920 --> 02:44:02,920
the price of the human heart

2487
02:44:02,920 --> 02:44:04,920
and every human organ?

2488
02:44:04,920 --> 02:44:06,920
So it looks exciting, Serenity.

2489
02:44:06,920 --> 02:44:08,920
And you know, you can't just say research

2490
02:44:08,920 --> 02:44:10,920
because it's like they're like,

2491
02:44:10,920 --> 02:44:11,920
well, what kind of research?

2492
02:44:11,920 --> 02:44:13,920
And then they ask way too many questions.

2493
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:16,920
I know exactly.

2494
02:44:16,920 --> 02:44:18,920
I had to take things off my throne

2495
02:44:18,920 --> 02:44:19,920
because I was like, hmm...

2496
02:44:19,920 --> 02:44:21,920
I think I'll put me on a hat.

2497
02:44:21,920 --> 02:44:22,920
I'll put me on a hat.

2498
02:44:22,920 --> 02:44:23,920
I remember.

2499
02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:24,920
I remember.

2500
02:44:24,920 --> 02:44:25,920
Because I was like, yo,

2501
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:28,920
she's about to do such cool crafts from this.

2502
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:29,920
Like, I'm so...

2503
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:31,920
Like, the bonesaw?

2504
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:32,920
I was so ready.

2505
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:35,920
I was so ready for your bonesaw, Ike.

2506
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:42,920
But like,

2507
02:44:42,920 --> 02:44:45,920
that's too many eyes on me, you know?

2508
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:47,920
Yeah.

2509
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:48,920
What's worse?

2510
02:44:48,920 --> 02:44:51,920
The FBI or the homeowner's association?

2511
02:44:51,920 --> 02:44:53,920
The homeowner's association?

2512
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:55,920
The HOA, definitely.

2513
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:58,920
HOA is rough, man.

2514
02:44:58,920 --> 02:45:00,920
You can't even have like a flamingo

2515
02:45:00,920 --> 02:45:02,920
on your lawn without the HOA being like,

2516
02:45:02,920 --> 02:45:04,920
how about you move out?

2517
02:45:04,920 --> 02:45:06,920
I don't get it!

2518
02:45:06,920 --> 02:45:08,920
You own the home!

2519
02:45:08,920 --> 02:45:10,920
I know!

2520
02:45:10,920 --> 02:45:11,920
I know!

2521
02:45:11,920 --> 02:45:13,920
Why the fuck do they care

2522
02:45:13,920 --> 02:45:15,920
if I'm gonna have like,

2523
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:17,920
like a space alien

2524
02:45:17,920 --> 02:45:19,920
drawing on my front lawn, you know?

2525
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:21,920
Like, come on, bro.

2526
02:45:21,920 --> 02:45:23,920
Let me have weird art on my front lawn.

2527
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:25,920
Let me be weird and quirky.

2528
02:45:26,920 --> 02:45:29,920
I don't know why there's such actual haters.

2529
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:33,920
The homeowner's association is wild.

2530
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:36,920
Like, some of them demand to have like, a key to your place.

2531
02:45:36,920 --> 02:45:37,920
Yeah!

2532
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:39,920
I know!

2533
02:45:39,920 --> 02:45:40,920
Why?

2534
02:45:40,920 --> 02:45:42,920
Bro, you ain't paying my mortgage.

2535
02:45:42,920 --> 02:45:46,920
Fuckin' put a ring on it if you want a key, Jesus.

2536
02:45:46,920 --> 02:45:47,920
Senpai!

2537
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:48,920
Senpai!

2538
02:45:48,920 --> 02:45:50,920
Oh, thank you,

2539
02:45:50,920 --> 02:45:51,920
holy west,

2540
02:45:51,920 --> 02:45:53,920
for the tan,

2541
02:45:53,920 --> 02:45:55,920
for the bonesaw fun!

2542
02:45:55,920 --> 02:45:56,920
Oh, wonderful.

2543
02:45:56,920 --> 02:45:58,920
Always wanted another bonesaw.

2544
02:46:00,920 --> 02:46:02,920
Now I can do half the work.

2545
02:46:02,920 --> 02:46:04,920
Like, all the work in half the time.

2546
02:46:04,920 --> 02:46:06,920
Oh my god.

2547
02:46:06,920 --> 02:46:09,920
You guys are just helping her be more efficient.

2548
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:11,920
Thank you.

2549
02:46:12,920 --> 02:46:15,920
I think Senpai's don't realize how,

2550
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:19,920
how important efficient this is to you, you know?

2551
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:23,920
Oh, they're gone.

2552
02:46:24,920 --> 02:46:25,920
Those are gone.

2553
02:46:25,920 --> 02:46:27,920
I'll take them.

2554
02:46:27,920 --> 02:46:30,920
Oh, it's a little burnt takoyaki.

2555
02:46:30,920 --> 02:46:32,920
Extra flavoring.

2556
02:46:32,920 --> 02:46:34,920
I'll take you to heaven,

2557
02:46:34,920 --> 02:46:37,920
because I'm about to be there in 50 seconds.

2558
02:46:43,920 --> 02:46:45,920
Oh my god, please let me squat.

2559
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:46,920
Please let me squat.

2560
02:46:46,920 --> 02:46:49,920
Oh, we're so far away from a fever.

2561
02:46:49,920 --> 02:46:50,920
We're so far away.

2562
02:46:50,920 --> 02:46:52,920
I'm so sorry, dear.

2563
02:46:52,920 --> 02:46:53,920
It's over.

2564
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:57,920
No, no, it's not over until I drop dead.

2565
02:46:59,920 --> 02:47:01,920
Man, it's over.

2566
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:04,920
It's so fine.

2567
02:47:04,920 --> 02:47:06,920
It's so fine.

2568
02:47:08,920 --> 02:47:10,920
We're so back.

2569
02:47:10,920 --> 02:47:12,920
We're back with the ham.

2570
02:47:12,920 --> 02:47:15,920
Ham across the way.

2571
02:47:17,920 --> 02:47:19,920
Wait, there's a story.

2572
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:21,920
My mom has back when she lived in a

2573
02:47:21,920 --> 02:47:23,920
homeowner's association many, many years ago.

2574
02:47:23,920 --> 02:47:25,920
A friend of hers left for work one day

2575
02:47:25,920 --> 02:47:27,920
and forgot to close her garage,

2576
02:47:27,920 --> 02:47:29,920
and that HOA decided to sell all her stuff.

2577
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:30,920
I would kill.

2578
02:47:30,920 --> 02:47:32,920
Including an $800 bike.

2579
02:47:32,920 --> 02:47:33,920
I would kill.

2580
02:47:33,920 --> 02:47:34,920
I would kill.

2581
02:47:34,920 --> 02:47:35,920
Excuse me?

2582
02:47:35,920 --> 02:47:37,920
What the fuck?

2583
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:40,920
That has to be illegal.

2584
02:47:41,920 --> 02:47:42,920
That has to be...

2585
02:47:42,920 --> 02:47:44,920
That has to be illegal, yeah.

2586
02:47:44,920 --> 02:47:46,920
Like, contract or not, right?

2587
02:47:47,920 --> 02:47:48,920
I don't...

2588
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:52,920
I honestly don't really understand how HOAs are legal

2589
02:47:52,920 --> 02:47:54,920
in the first place, to be honest.

2590
02:47:54,920 --> 02:47:57,920
Because it feels very much like,

2591
02:47:57,920 --> 02:48:00,920
I don't know, just some guy being like,

2592
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:02,920
I don't fucking like you.

2593
02:48:02,920 --> 02:48:04,920
I'm gonna make your life hard now.

2594
02:48:04,920 --> 02:48:05,920
Fuck you.

2595
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:06,920
And it's like, what?

2596
02:48:06,920 --> 02:48:08,920
That's why if I'm ever...

2597
02:48:08,920 --> 02:48:10,920
I like saw some houses.

2598
02:48:10,920 --> 02:48:12,920
Because I'm like house hunting kind of.

2599
02:48:12,920 --> 02:48:14,920
Like potential house houses.

2600
02:48:14,920 --> 02:48:15,920
I'm like...

2601
02:48:15,920 --> 02:48:17,920
Half of them have like,

2602
02:48:17,920 --> 02:48:19,920
a home owner's association fee

2603
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:23,920
and I'm like, a fee to go with those bastards?

2604
02:48:23,920 --> 02:48:24,920
No.

2605
02:48:24,920 --> 02:48:25,920
No.

2606
02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:26,920
No.

2607
02:48:27,920 --> 02:48:28,920
Ugh.

2608
02:48:28,920 --> 02:48:31,920
So, Mercy house arc?

2609
02:48:31,920 --> 02:48:34,920
I'm so excited for you.

2610
02:48:34,920 --> 02:48:36,920
I'm trying to, I'm trying.

2611
02:48:36,920 --> 02:48:38,920
As soon as like, things stabilize,

2612
02:48:38,920 --> 02:48:40,920
I'm gonna, I'm gonna try my own,

2613
02:48:40,920 --> 02:48:41,920
try to get my own place,

2614
02:48:41,920 --> 02:48:43,920
get a down payment,

2615
02:48:43,920 --> 02:48:45,920
pay the mortgage.

2616
02:48:45,920 --> 02:48:47,920
Cause it's cheaper than rent.

2617
02:48:47,920 --> 02:48:50,920
I believe, I hope.

2618
02:48:50,920 --> 02:48:52,920
That's so upsetting that mortgage is,

2619
02:48:52,920 --> 02:48:54,920
is cheaper than rent.

2620
02:48:54,920 --> 02:48:55,920
That's crazy.

2621
02:48:55,920 --> 02:48:57,920
Like, I, I calculate.

2622
02:48:57,920 --> 02:48:59,920
What am I doing?

2623
02:49:00,920 --> 02:49:01,920
I calculated it.

2624
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:02,920
That like,

2625
02:49:02,920 --> 02:49:04,920
Ah, not the cucumber.

2626
02:49:04,920 --> 02:49:06,920
That with insurance,

2627
02:49:06,920 --> 02:49:08,920
like yearly insurance and mortgage,

2628
02:49:08,920 --> 02:49:10,920
it's cheaper than rent.

2629
02:49:10,920 --> 02:49:12,920
Jesus.

2630
02:49:14,920 --> 02:49:15,920
Still.

2631
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:17,920
Oh, and property tax as well.

2632
02:49:17,920 --> 02:49:19,920
It's so cheaper than rent.

2633
02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:21,920
Jeez.

2634
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:23,920
Fuck that.

2635
02:49:23,920 --> 02:49:24,920
Honestly, I'm like,

2636
02:49:24,920 --> 02:49:27,920
this is a messed up system.

2637
02:49:28,920 --> 02:49:31,920
The fact that it's cheaper to buy.

2638
02:49:31,920 --> 02:49:33,920
Oop oop oop oop oop.

2639
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:35,920
Balls, balls, gimme your balls, gimme your balls.

2640
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:37,920
It's like, cheaper to buy,

2641
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:38,920
but like a,

2642
02:49:38,920 --> 02:49:40,920
what do you call it?

2643
02:49:41,920 --> 02:49:43,920
Cough, cough, cough.

2644
02:49:44,920 --> 02:49:45,920
The um,

2645
02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:46,920
what do you call it?

2646
02:49:46,920 --> 02:49:48,920
The initial cost,

2647
02:49:48,920 --> 02:49:50,920
it's really high.

2648
02:49:58,920 --> 02:49:59,920
It's really high,

2649
02:49:59,920 --> 02:50:01,920
but like afterwards,

2650
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:03,920
it's, it's, it's.

2651
02:50:04,920 --> 02:50:05,920
It's like better.

2652
02:50:05,920 --> 02:50:07,920
It's better.

2653
02:50:07,920 --> 02:50:09,920
I mean, it makes sense too,

2654
02:50:09,920 --> 02:50:10,920
because with like rent,

2655
02:50:10,920 --> 02:50:12,920
you are,

2656
02:50:12,920 --> 02:50:14,920
you're really just paying your rent

2657
02:50:14,920 --> 02:50:16,920
for, for ever essentially.

2658
02:50:17,920 --> 02:50:19,920
So like it definitely like

2659
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:20,920
shuts out.

2660
02:50:20,920 --> 02:50:21,920
And like,

2661
02:50:21,920 --> 02:50:22,920
huh,

2662
02:50:22,920 --> 02:50:23,920
could you imagine?

2663
02:50:23,920 --> 02:50:24,920
Oh, I freaking died.

2664
02:50:24,920 --> 02:50:25,920
Oh, how?

2665
02:50:25,920 --> 02:50:26,920
No!

2666
02:50:26,920 --> 02:50:27,920
Oh!

2667
02:50:27,920 --> 02:50:28,920
I don't even have enough

2668
02:50:28,920 --> 02:50:29,920
to like,

2669
02:50:29,920 --> 02:50:31,920
upgrade any of my skills.

2670
02:50:31,920 --> 02:50:32,920
No!

2671
02:50:32,920 --> 02:50:33,920
That's terrible.

2672
02:50:33,920 --> 02:50:34,920
You can run out?

2673
02:50:34,920 --> 02:50:36,920
Oh shit, oh shit.

2674
02:50:37,920 --> 02:50:39,920
I don't have anything to like,

2675
02:50:39,920 --> 02:50:41,920
ugh, I'm dying.

2676
02:50:42,920 --> 02:50:43,920
This game's evil.

2677
02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:44,920
I feel like I,

2678
02:50:44,920 --> 02:50:45,920
I'm, I'm like,

2679
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:46,920
I'm starting to get

2680
02:50:46,920 --> 02:50:47,920
to that point where I'm like.

2681
02:50:49,920 --> 02:50:50,920
We can,

2682
02:50:50,920 --> 02:50:51,920
whenever you're ready.

2683
02:50:51,920 --> 02:50:52,920
I'm, I'm,

2684
02:50:52,920 --> 02:50:53,920
I'm good to chill.

2685
02:50:54,920 --> 02:50:55,920
Yeah!

2686
02:50:55,920 --> 02:50:56,920
Like I think I'm getting

2687
02:50:56,920 --> 02:50:57,920
a little too excited too,

2688
02:50:57,920 --> 02:50:58,920
so like I'm,

2689
02:50:58,920 --> 02:50:59,920
I'm getting like,

2690
02:50:59,920 --> 02:51:00,920
what do you call it?

2691
02:51:00,920 --> 02:51:01,920
No, I feel you.

2692
02:51:01,920 --> 02:51:02,920
I'm good whenever you want to.

2693
02:51:02,920 --> 02:51:03,920
Yeah.

2694
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:04,920
Yeah, I'm just,

2695
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:05,920
I'm just happy to be here.

2696
02:51:05,920 --> 02:51:06,920
Are you kidding me?

2697
02:51:08,920 --> 02:51:09,920
I love you.

2698
02:51:09,920 --> 02:51:10,920
I like,

2699
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:11,920

2700
02:51:11,920 --> 02:51:12,920
so long.

2701
02:51:15,920 --> 02:51:16,920
I know,

2702
02:51:16,920 --> 02:51:17,920

02:51:22,920 --> 02:51:23,920
I'm happy to talk

2709
02:51:23,920 --> 02:51:24,920

02:51:25,920 --> 02:51:26,920
Like,

02:51:27,920 --> 02:51:28,920
you know?

2713
02:51:28,920 --> 02:51:29,920
Yeah.

2714
02:51:29,920 --> 02:51:30,920
I'm just getting

2715
02:51:30,920 --> 02:51:31,920
really flummy.

2716
02:51:32,920 --> 02:51:33,920
I feel,

2717
02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:34,920
I feel.

2718
02:51:34,920 --> 02:51:35,920
And like,

2719
02:51:35,920 --> 02:51:36,920
you know,

2720
02:51:36,920 --> 02:51:37,920
we can,

2721
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:38,920
we can always collab again,

2722
02:51:38,920 --> 02:51:39,920
one other.

2723
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:40,920
I'm not going anywhere.

2724
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:41,920
Honestly,

2725
02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:42,920
we were like talking about

2726
02:51:42,920 --> 02:51:43,920
Senpai,

2727
02:51:43,920 --> 02:51:44,920
we were like talking about

2728
02:51:44,920 --> 02:51:45,920
Senpai and

2729
02:51:45,920 --> 02:51:46,920
Sweetie Bunch,

2730
02:51:46,920 --> 02:51:47,920
because I know some of you

2731
02:51:47,920 --> 02:51:48,920
are here.

2732
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:50,920
We were talking about

2733
02:51:50,920 --> 02:51:51,920
how we were going to like,

2734
02:51:52,920 --> 02:51:53,920
kind of like,

2735
02:51:54,920 --> 02:51:55,920
first it'll be my channel

2736
02:51:55,920 --> 02:51:56,920
and then we'll go to,

2737
02:51:56,920 --> 02:51:57,920
go to Serenity's channel

2738
02:51:57,920 --> 02:51:58,920
and then we're going to

2739
02:51:58,920 --> 02:52:00,920
collab back on my channel.

2740
02:52:00,920 --> 02:52:01,920
We're going to just like

2741
02:52:01,920 --> 02:52:02,920
switch all the time.

2742
02:52:02,920 --> 02:52:04,920
We're going to ping-pong it.

2743
02:52:05,920 --> 02:52:06,920
We're going to ping-pong

2744
02:52:06,920 --> 02:52:07,920
like these balls.

2745
02:52:08,920 --> 02:52:09,920
Because like,

2746
02:52:09,920 --> 02:52:10,920
I don't know,

2747
02:52:10,920 --> 02:52:11,920
I feel like that's,

2748
02:52:11,920 --> 02:52:12,920
unless it's like a game

2749
02:52:12,920 --> 02:52:13,920
where we have to have

2750
02:52:13,920 --> 02:52:14,920
both,

2751
02:52:14,920 --> 02:52:15,920
both POVs,

2752
02:52:16,920 --> 02:52:17,920
doesn't that,

2753
02:52:17,920 --> 02:52:18,920
when it's like one of those,

2754
02:52:18,920 --> 02:52:19,920
I don't know,

2755
02:52:19,920 --> 02:52:20,920
I'm trying to think of like a game

2756
02:52:20,920 --> 02:52:21,920
that's like that,

2757
02:52:21,920 --> 02:52:22,920
that would be played.

2758
02:52:22,920 --> 02:52:23,920
Did someone say ping-pong?

2759
02:52:23,920 --> 02:52:24,920
Alright.

2760
02:52:24,920 --> 02:52:25,920
Did you know

2761
02:52:25,920 --> 02:52:26,920
that they play ping-pong?

2762
02:52:27,920 --> 02:52:28,920
Wait, what?

2763
02:52:30,920 --> 02:52:31,920
When I'm not looking,

2764
02:52:31,920 --> 02:52:32,920
they play ping-pong.

2765
02:52:33,920 --> 02:52:34,920
What?

2766
02:52:40,920 --> 02:52:41,920
Feeling?

2767
02:52:41,920 --> 02:52:42,920
Look, look at Chad.

2768
02:52:43,920 --> 02:52:44,920
Oh my god, there!

2769
02:52:46,920 --> 02:52:47,920
He's living.

2770
02:52:52,920 --> 02:52:53,920
I hope one person

2771
02:52:53,920 --> 02:52:54,920
just replies to me,

2772
02:52:54,920 --> 02:52:55,920
I'm winning.

2773
02:53:01,920 --> 02:53:02,920
And then,

2774
02:53:02,920 --> 02:53:03,920
they always do it

2775
02:53:03,920 --> 02:53:04,920
when I'm gone.

2776
02:53:04,920 --> 02:53:05,920
And then,

2777
02:53:07,920 --> 02:53:08,920
and then,

2778
02:53:08,920 --> 02:53:09,920
they clean up immediately

2779
02:53:09,920 --> 02:53:10,920
when I get back.

2780
02:53:12,920 --> 02:53:13,920
They're, they're,

2781
02:53:13,920 --> 02:53:14,920
they're like a fucking system.

2782
02:53:14,920 --> 02:53:16,920
They do have a system?

2783
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:20,920
I,

2784
02:53:20,920 --> 02:53:21,920
I'm impressed.

2785
02:53:22,920 --> 02:53:23,920
Oh, I died.

2786
02:53:23,920 --> 02:53:24,920
See, look at them,

2787
02:53:24,920 --> 02:53:25,920
look at them.

2788
02:53:27,920 --> 02:53:28,920
Oh my god,

2789
02:53:28,920 --> 02:53:29,920
they're cleaning up!

2790
02:53:32,920 --> 02:53:33,920
Oh my god!

2791
02:53:35,920 --> 02:53:36,920
Oh my god,

2792
02:53:36,920 --> 02:53:37,920
they're cleaning up

2793
02:53:37,920 --> 02:53:38,920
after themselves!

2794
02:53:39,920 --> 02:53:40,920
They're so good, right?

2795
02:53:41,920 --> 02:53:42,920
They're so cute!

2796
02:53:43,920 --> 02:53:44,920
They're so cute!

2797
02:53:45,920 --> 02:53:46,920
Oh my god!

2798
02:53:49,920 --> 02:53:50,920
Don't let the boss run away!

2799
02:53:53,920 --> 02:53:54,920
They have such good manners!

2800
02:53:54,920 --> 02:53:55,920
I love them!

2801
02:53:56,920 --> 02:53:57,920
This is so,

2802
02:53:57,920 --> 02:53:58,920
this is so,

2803
02:53:58,920 --> 02:53:59,920
this is so,

2804
02:53:59,920 --> 02:54:00,920
this is so,

2805
02:54:00,920 --> 02:54:01,920

2818
02:54:26,920 --> 02:54:27,920

2819
02:54:28,920 --> 02:54:29,920

02:56:29,920 --> 02:56:30,920
Senpai!

2890
02:56:30,920 --> 02:56:31,920
Senpai!

2891
02:56:33,920 --> 02:56:34,920
Oh wait,

2892
02:56:34,920 --> 02:56:35,920
it's playing everything again.

2893
02:56:38,920 --> 02:56:39,920
Oh,

2894
02:56:39,920 --> 02:56:40,920

2895
02:56:40,920 --> 02:56:41,920
let me move us.

2896
02:56:49,920 --> 02:56:50,920
There we go,

2903
02:57:07,920 --> 02:57:08,920
The tackle,

2904
02:57:08,920 --> 02:57:10,920
the tackle buns are so cute.

2905
02:57:14,920 --> 02:57:15,920
Hold on,

2906
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:16,920
I gotta unlock,

2907
02:57:16,920 --> 02:57:17,920
unlock it and then,

2908
02:57:18,920 --> 02:57:19,920
Senpai!

2909
02:57:23,920 --> 02:57:24,920
Serenity muted,

2910
02:57:24,920 --> 02:57:25,920
hold on,

2911
02:57:25,920 --> 02:57:26,920
hold on,

2912
02:57:26,920 --> 02:57:27,920
hold on,

2913
02:57:27,920 --> 02:57:28,920
I gotta,

2914
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:30,920
oh no!

2915
02:57:32,920 --> 02:57:33,920
She's,

2916
02:57:33,920 --> 02:57:34,920
she's drunk off of power!

2917
02:57:46,920 --> 02:57:47,920
And I,

2918
02:57:47,920 --> 02:57:48,920
you're here,

2919
02:57:48,920 --> 02:57:49,920
you're alive now.

2920
02:57:51,920 --> 02:57:52,920
Anything I just said,

2921
02:57:52,920 --> 02:57:53,920
anything I just said.

2922
02:57:56,920 --> 02:57:57,920
What is she saying?

2923
02:57:57,920 --> 02:57:58,920
They're debanning.

2924
02:57:59,920 --> 02:58:00,920
I wonder,

2925
02:58:00,920 --> 02:58:01,920
I wonder,

2926
02:58:05,920 --> 02:58:06,920
what could I have said?

2927
02:58:08,920 --> 02:58:09,920
I'm easel.

2928
02:58:15,920 --> 02:58:16,920
It's our secret,

2929
02:58:16,920 --> 02:58:17,920
it's our little secret.

2930
02:58:17,920 --> 02:58:18,920
Yeah,

2931
02:58:18,920 --> 02:58:19,920
it's our secret,

2932
02:58:19,920 --> 02:58:20,920
you can't know our secrets.

2933
02:58:20,920 --> 02:58:22,920
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2934
02:58:25,920 --> 02:58:26,920
I'm so happy,

2935
02:58:26,920 --> 02:58:28,920
I'm so fucking happy right now.

2936
02:58:29,920 --> 02:58:30,920
Me too.

2937
02:58:31,920 --> 02:58:32,920
I'm sorry,

2938
02:58:32,920 --> 02:58:34,920
I'm staring at your tackle yaki hair buns,

2939
02:58:34,920 --> 02:58:35,920
they're so good.

2940
02:58:36,920 --> 02:58:37,920
The second I saw like,

2941
02:58:37,920 --> 02:58:38,920
the little ones,

2942
02:58:38,920 --> 02:58:39,920
I was like,

2943
02:58:39,920 --> 02:58:40,920
wait,

2944
02:58:40,920 --> 02:58:41,920
I know what I can do.

2945
02:58:41,920 --> 02:58:42,920
You're like the queen

2946
02:58:42,920 --> 02:58:43,920
of finding the cutest assets.

2947
02:58:43,920 --> 02:58:44,920
My,

2948
02:58:44,920 --> 02:58:45,920
my god.

2949
02:58:46,920 --> 02:58:47,920
I love finding assets

2950
02:58:47,920 --> 02:58:48,920
to match this tree.

2951
02:58:49,920 --> 02:58:50,920
You're so good at it.

2952
02:58:50,920 --> 02:58:51,920
I was like,

2953
02:58:51,920 --> 02:58:52,920
look at that.

2954
02:58:52,920 --> 02:58:53,920
I'll be like,

2955
02:58:54,920 --> 02:58:55,920
clip,

2956
02:58:55,920 --> 02:58:56,920
clip art.

2957
02:58:57,920 --> 02:58:58,920
Transparent,

2958
02:58:59,920 --> 02:59:00,920
and then it's never transparent.

2959
02:59:06,920 --> 02:59:08,920
I'm getting cozy now.

2960
02:59:09,920 --> 02:59:10,920
We're so cozy.

2961
02:59:12,920 --> 02:59:13,920
Hold on, let me,

2962
02:59:14,920 --> 02:59:15,920
there we go.

2963
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:16,920
There we go.

2964
02:59:19,920 --> 02:59:20,920
So we're not coming

2965
02:59:20,920 --> 02:59:21,920
being my big ass hair.

2966
02:59:24,920 --> 02:59:25,920
Your hair is so huge.

2967
02:59:25,920 --> 02:59:26,920
I love it though.

2968
02:59:26,920 --> 02:59:28,920
I remember when you were like,

2969
02:59:28,920 --> 02:59:29,920
you're like,

2970
02:59:29,920 --> 02:59:30,920
I can show the model now.

2971
02:59:30,920 --> 02:59:31,920
And I saw it.

2972
02:59:33,920 --> 02:59:34,920
And I was like,

2973
02:59:35,920 --> 02:59:37,920
I know what I was like finally,

2974
02:59:37,920 --> 02:59:38,920
you can see,

2975
02:59:38,920 --> 02:59:39,920
you can see my form.

2976
02:59:43,920 --> 02:59:44,920
But wait,

2977
02:59:44,920 --> 02:59:45,920
it was the worst.

2978
02:59:45,920 --> 02:59:46,920
It was the worst

2979
02:59:46,920 --> 02:59:47,920
being hidden for so long.

2980
02:59:47,920 --> 02:59:48,920
Cause it's like,

2981
02:59:48,920 --> 02:59:49,920
I wanna show you everything.

2982
02:59:49,920 --> 02:59:50,920
Yeah.

2983
02:59:52,920 --> 02:59:53,920
Then when the tree

2984
02:59:53,920 --> 02:59:54,920
was on the other foot,

2985
02:59:55,920 --> 02:59:56,920
when I,

2986
02:59:56,920 --> 02:59:57,920
I was going crazy.

2987
02:59:57,920 --> 02:59:58,920
You saw, you saw.

2988
02:59:58,920 --> 02:59:59,920
Yeah, I saw.

2989
02:59:59,920 --> 03:00:00,920
You were like,

2990
03:00:00,920 --> 03:00:01,920
you were making theories

2991
03:00:01,920 --> 03:00:02,920
about what I was gonna look like.

2992
03:00:04,920 --> 03:00:05,920
Like all you had was

2993
03:00:05,920 --> 03:00:06,920
like the silhouette.

2994
03:00:07,920 --> 03:00:08,920
I did.

2995
03:00:08,920 --> 03:00:09,920
And then you had a very good guess

2996
03:00:09,920 --> 03:00:10,920
cause I was like,

2997
03:00:10,920 --> 03:00:11,920
okay, well,

2998
03:00:11,920 --> 03:00:12,920
I'm gonna give you a hint

2999
03:00:12,920 --> 03:00:13,920
about which silhouette I am.

3000
03:00:13,920 --> 03:00:14,920
And then you,

3001
03:00:14,920 --> 03:00:15,920
you figured out right away.

3002
03:00:18,920 --> 03:00:19,920
Cause like,

3003
03:00:19,920 --> 03:00:20,920
I don't know.

3004
03:00:20,920 --> 03:00:21,920
First off,

3005
03:00:21,920 --> 03:00:22,920
it's so clever.

3006
03:00:22,920 --> 03:00:23,920
I mean,

3007
03:00:23,920 --> 03:00:24,920
all of you guys' designs

3008
03:00:24,920 --> 03:00:25,920
are so fun and clever.

3009
03:00:26,920 --> 03:00:27,920
Of course,

3010
03:00:27,920 --> 03:00:28,920
I have a bias in society.

3011
03:00:29,920 --> 03:00:30,920
Everyone is stupid to be cool,

3012
03:00:30,920 --> 03:00:31,920
but I have a bias

3013
03:00:31,920 --> 03:00:32,920
and that's messy,

3014
03:00:32,920 --> 03:00:33,920
messy, messy, messy, messy.

3015
03:00:37,920 --> 03:00:38,920
But like,

3016
03:00:39,920 --> 03:00:40,920
I love,

3017
03:00:41,920 --> 03:00:42,920
I don't wanna say

3018
03:00:42,920 --> 03:00:43,920
this one out loud

3019
03:00:43,920 --> 03:00:44,920
because

3020
03:00:44,920 --> 03:00:45,920
it was gonna be a surprise

3021
03:00:45,920 --> 03:00:46,920
for you too,

3022
03:00:46,920 --> 03:00:47,920
but I'm really slow

3023
03:00:47,920 --> 03:00:48,920
comes to drawing.

3024
03:00:49,920 --> 03:00:50,920
I was gonna make

3025
03:00:50,920 --> 03:00:51,920
a comic about us.

3026
03:00:53,920 --> 03:00:54,920
I give you a little

3027
03:00:54,920 --> 03:00:55,920
sweaty

3028
03:00:55,920 --> 03:00:56,920
and then you cut it out

3029
03:00:57,920 --> 03:00:58,920
so like,

3030
03:00:58,920 --> 03:00:59,920
you know,

3031
03:00:59,920 --> 03:01:00,920
it's more your style.

3032
03:01:03,920 --> 03:01:04,920
I get the draft

3033
03:01:04,920 --> 03:01:05,920
of this comic

3034
03:01:05,920 --> 03:01:06,920
like the J,

3035
03:01:06,920 --> 03:01:07,920
the J,

3036
03:01:07,920 --> 03:01:08,920
your design draw.

3037
03:01:09,920 --> 03:01:10,920
I love you.

3038
03:01:10,920 --> 03:01:11,920
I love you.

3039
03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:12,920
But like,

3040
03:01:12,920 --> 03:01:13,920
I love you.

3041
03:01:15,920 --> 03:01:16,920
Do I still,

3042
03:01:16,920 --> 03:01:17,920
do I still have,

3043
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:18,920
do I have you?

3044
03:01:18,920 --> 03:01:19,920
Hold on.

3045
03:01:19,920 --> 03:01:20,920
I do.

3046
03:01:24,920 --> 03:01:25,920
I don't know if you'll show up,

3047
03:01:25,920 --> 03:01:26,920
but

3048
03:01:29,920 --> 03:01:30,920
that's me.

3049
03:01:37,920 --> 03:01:38,920
Look at that,

3050
03:01:38,920 --> 03:01:39,920
it's me.

3051
03:01:41,920 --> 03:01:42,920
It's a me.

3052
03:01:43,920 --> 03:01:44,920
It's a me.

3053
03:01:44,920 --> 03:01:45,920
Nicely.

3054
03:01:47,920 --> 03:01:48,920
My favorite Mario.

3055
03:01:48,920 --> 03:01:49,920
Merci.

3056
03:01:52,920 --> 03:01:53,920
No, she looks so huggable.

3057
03:01:53,920 --> 03:01:54,920
She is.

3058
03:01:54,920 --> 03:01:55,920
And I can hug her

3059
03:01:55,920 --> 03:01:56,920
right now.

3060
03:01:56,920 --> 03:01:57,920
You guys can't.

3061
03:01:58,920 --> 03:01:59,920
This is me hugging.

3062
03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:00,920
We're hugging.

3063
03:02:00,920 --> 03:02:01,920
I promise.

3064
03:02:02,920 --> 03:02:03,920
You can't see our arms.

3065
03:02:03,920 --> 03:02:04,920
So hugging.

3066
03:02:04,920 --> 03:02:05,920
Hugging.

3067
03:02:14,920 --> 03:02:15,920
What are you going to do

3068
03:02:15,920 --> 03:02:17,920
to keep girls are hugging?

3069
03:02:17,920 --> 03:02:19,920
Can't do anything to stop it.

3070
03:02:24,920 --> 03:02:25,920
I'm so,

3071
03:02:25,920 --> 03:02:27,920
I'm so sorry for teasing.

3072
03:02:27,920 --> 03:02:28,920
I'm so sorry for teasing

3073
03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:30,920
and being so,

3074
03:02:30,920 --> 03:02:32,920
so rude to the boys sometimes.

3075
03:02:32,920 --> 03:02:33,920
It's okay.

3076
03:02:33,920 --> 03:02:34,920
They deserve it.

3077
03:02:36,920 --> 03:02:37,920
They deserve it.

3078
03:02:37,920 --> 03:02:38,920
I let you

3079
03:02:38,920 --> 03:02:39,920
because you have best friend

3080
03:02:39,920 --> 03:02:40,920
Braille.

3081
03:02:43,920 --> 03:02:44,920
It's just so fun.

3082
03:02:45,920 --> 03:02:46,920
Sanity is not sorry.

3083
03:02:46,920 --> 03:02:48,920
I'm a little sorry

3084
03:02:48,920 --> 03:02:49,920
because you guys are so nice

3085
03:02:49,920 --> 03:02:50,920
and cute, you know?

3086
03:02:50,920 --> 03:02:52,920
You're so sweet to her.

3087
03:02:52,920 --> 03:02:53,920
Right?

3088
03:02:53,920 --> 03:02:54,920
They're so kind.

3089
03:02:55,920 --> 03:02:56,920
But like because of that,

3090
03:02:56,920 --> 03:02:58,920
it's a little fun to be like,

3091
03:02:59,920 --> 03:03:00,920
yeah.

3092
03:03:00,920 --> 03:03:01,920
You know what it is?

3093
03:03:01,920 --> 03:03:02,920
It's because I want to see this

3094
03:03:02,920 --> 03:03:03,920
sometimes to reassure you.

3095
03:03:03,920 --> 03:03:04,920
That's it.

3096
03:03:05,920 --> 03:03:06,920
It's like me reading

3097
03:03:06,920 --> 03:03:07,920
a romance story.

3098
03:03:07,920 --> 03:03:08,920
I'm like, yeah,

3099
03:03:08,920 --> 03:03:09,920
get a little jealous.

3100
03:03:09,920 --> 03:03:10,920
Get a little jealous

3101
03:03:10,920 --> 03:03:11,920
so that we can go on to

3102
03:03:11,920 --> 03:03:12,920
very fancy and be like,

3103
03:03:12,920 --> 03:03:13,920
we love you a lot too.

3104
03:03:13,920 --> 03:03:14,920
And then you can be like,

3105
03:03:14,920 --> 03:03:15,920
yeah, I know sometimes.

3106
03:03:16,920 --> 03:03:17,920
And then like,

3107
03:03:17,920 --> 03:03:18,920
you know,

3108
03:03:18,920 --> 03:03:19,920
you give them a little treat

3109
03:03:19,920 --> 03:03:20,920
in the cage.

3110
03:03:22,920 --> 03:03:23,920
And then little smooches.

3111
03:03:25,920 --> 03:03:26,920
Yeah.

3112
03:03:28,920 --> 03:03:29,920
Yeah, they,

3113
03:03:29,920 --> 03:03:30,920
they are good.

3114
03:03:30,920 --> 03:03:31,920
They are good.

3115
03:03:31,920 --> 03:03:32,920
They are great.

3116
03:03:32,920 --> 03:03:33,920
Like I love them.

3117
03:03:33,920 --> 03:03:34,920
Like legitimately love them.

3118
03:03:39,920 --> 03:03:40,920
Like I tell Serenity,

3119
03:03:40,920 --> 03:03:41,920
I'm like, I love them.

3120
03:03:41,920 --> 03:03:42,920
What the heck?

3121
03:03:46,920 --> 03:03:47,920
Like just girly things.

3122
03:03:48,920 --> 03:03:49,920
Yeah,

3123
03:03:49,920 --> 03:03:51,920
we got gossip about you guys.

3124
03:03:52,920 --> 03:03:53,920
Yeah,

3125
03:03:53,920 --> 03:03:54,920
I know all the secrets.

3126
03:03:59,920 --> 03:04:00,920
She helps me set up the traps too.

3127
03:04:03,920 --> 03:04:04,920
The traps in the basement

3128
03:04:04,920 --> 03:04:05,920
in case you try to escape.

3129
03:04:08,920 --> 03:04:09,920
Come on,

3130
03:04:09,920 --> 03:04:10,920
could you imagine the home alone

3131
03:04:10,920 --> 03:04:11,920
shit we come across?

3132
03:04:11,920 --> 03:04:12,920
Right.

3133
03:04:12,920 --> 03:04:13,920
Like,

3134
03:04:13,920 --> 03:04:14,920
like at that point,

3135
03:04:14,920 --> 03:04:16,920
you're too scared to leave the basement.

3136
03:04:16,920 --> 03:04:17,920
You don't know if you're gonna like,

3137
03:04:17,920 --> 03:04:18,920
slip on marbles

3138
03:04:18,920 --> 03:04:19,920
or like,

3139
03:04:19,920 --> 03:04:20,920
oh,

3140
03:04:20,920 --> 03:04:21,920
I almost said something terrible.

3141
03:04:26,920 --> 03:04:27,920
I'm going to text it to you.

3142
03:04:27,920 --> 03:04:29,920

03:04:55,040 --> 03:04:57,040
You know you are the saw

3144
03:04:57,200 --> 03:05:01,200
The saw like breaks and then the cliff falls instead of like those the edge

3145
03:05:06,080 --> 03:05:08,080

3150
03:05:44,080 --> 03:05:47,600
Like I don't know it was just such an instant click of being like wow

But then like we're also the type that like open up immediately

Oh, how do we compete with serenity chat?

3161
03:07:00,880 --> 03:07:04,000
You don't have to compete because they're not competition

3162
03:07:11,680 --> 03:07:17,040
It's because you're my number one she's here to like cheer us on

We would work hours together. Just like

3248
03:17:17,600 --> 03:17:20,000
And then we would review each other's audition video

3249
03:17:23,600 --> 03:17:25,600
And then the leading game together

3250
03:17:26,960 --> 03:17:28,960

No, but I think you're very you're very well suited for VNU as well. You seem so happy

3254
03:17:48,720 --> 03:17:53,760
Every time you mess with me, you're like, I got a plan coming. I'm so happy staff is so kind to me

3255
03:17:54,320 --> 03:18:02,160
I know I'm always coming up to you like you'll never guess the new thing I'm planning, huh?

3256
03:18:04,480 --> 03:18:10,800
I'm like you're crazy friends in the basement another basement just crawling up. You have two basements

3257
03:18:13,680 --> 03:18:18,480
One for Senpai's and that one's all nice and then there's the one I'm in where it's like

3258
03:18:19,280 --> 03:18:24,480
Have you ever seen Breaking Bad? I haven't but I imagine if he had a basement it'd be like that

3259
03:18:28,320 --> 03:18:32,160
It's like you keep mercy on her her toes too. Yeah, well

3260
03:18:33,280 --> 03:18:37,280
She she gives me some surprises and stuff, but you know, I love all her surprises

3261
03:18:38,160 --> 03:18:42,480
Sometimes you also run by me something saying like do you think this is a good idea? And I'm like, yeah, of course

3262
03:18:43,840 --> 03:18:47,280
I gave a little forewarning if I'm just like, maybe it's not a good idea

3263
03:18:47,760 --> 03:18:53,200
No, but your fucking advice is so great like you don't like you don't understand like I

3264
03:18:53,840 --> 03:18:59,760
I don't think I'd be here without you. Yeah. Well, no, I know for a fact. I wouldn't be here without you. However, come on

3265
03:19:02,080 --> 03:19:04,080
Like just

3266
03:19:04,320 --> 03:19:09,040
That's like too equitable to too many things, but it's true. I I really wouldn't

3267
03:19:13,920 --> 03:19:15,920
I love you I love you too

3268
03:19:18,160 --> 03:19:20,160
I'm so happy

3269
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:28,880
This is like our first collab together, which is great. We've been waiting for this role. I was like, when are you free?

3270
03:19:32,560 --> 03:19:34,560
We gotta pick a game

3271
03:19:35,360 --> 03:19:38,560
God, I know that was the hardest was just picking

3272
03:19:38,960 --> 03:19:43,920
It's the hardest is always just picking the one game to play first because it's like

3273
03:19:44,880 --> 03:19:47,360
I mean with my fucking crunchy ass cough

3274
03:19:49,040 --> 03:19:55,200
Because like there's I open my steam library and I'm just like that would be fun. That would be fun. That would be fun. That would be fun

3275
03:19:57,920 --> 03:19:59,920
How soon do you think the next collab will be?

3276
03:20:02,400 --> 03:20:04,400
Whenever you're free

3277
03:20:05,600 --> 03:20:10,240
I have to set up a schedule for it because I well there are several plans, you know

3278
03:20:10,560 --> 03:20:12,560
Mm-hmm

3279
03:20:12,880 --> 03:20:17,440
We're both busy girls, but also we're trying our best to find a free time together

3280
03:20:19,200 --> 03:20:23,600
We don't get to do as much calls as we used to we used to like be like, okay, let's call

3281
03:20:24,640 --> 03:20:28,800
It makes me so I'm happy we text a lot. Yeah, we text a lot

3282
03:20:29,440 --> 03:20:32,400
I make me happy because I feel that I know I it's like

3283
03:20:33,520 --> 03:20:36,720
Whatever we're both working. It's just it's so high

3284
03:20:37,600 --> 03:20:38,880
but like

3285
03:20:38,880 --> 03:20:43,040
I'm happy. I'm happy. We at least text and talk talk a lot, you know

3286
03:20:43,840 --> 03:20:46,880
I do want to call more though. I miss them. I miss yeah, I miss them too

3287
03:20:49,360 --> 03:20:53,200
Yeah, I always text I always text we got each other's phone numbers

3288
03:20:55,920 --> 03:21:02,160

3289
03:21:02,560 --> 03:21:04,560
Like

3290
03:21:07,440 --> 03:21:09,440
And then we just text

3291
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:18,000
My phone's right here

3292
03:21:18,400 --> 03:21:20,400
Oh, there's so much pressure

3293
03:21:29,920 --> 03:21:36,480
Hold on I'm gonna reply. Oh my god. Oh my god guys. Do you think she's gonna reply to me? Do you think she's gonna reply? Oh my god, here we are

3294
03:21:38,480 --> 03:21:42,560
I I think it's really funny though because um

3295
03:21:48,720 --> 03:21:52,240
Because like so I have a bunch of heart emojis

3296
03:21:54,560 --> 03:21:58,640
Seriously? Yeah, I have ears so professionally in my phone

3297
03:22:00,880 --> 03:22:07,680
Mine is not mine is not professional mine mine says messy like 50 heart emojis

3298
03:22:10,320 --> 03:22:12,320
In parenthesis

3299
03:22:12,320 --> 03:22:14,320
Wow

3300
03:22:14,960 --> 03:22:18,880
But I've spelled it like how you would say it if you were doing a borat voice

3301
03:22:22,160 --> 03:22:25,840
Your name is too long to appear fully in my silence

3302
03:22:31,440 --> 03:22:34,080
I do it with everyone and even my mom

3303
03:22:36,320 --> 03:22:40,240
Even even the parents even the parents are like super professional looking

3304
03:22:40,880 --> 03:22:46,880
It's like first name last name, you know, parentheses mother

3305
03:22:52,240 --> 03:22:54,720
Yeah, no, I'm I'm quirky

3306
03:22:58,320 --> 03:23:02,000
Even even my family even my family isn't saved normal

3307
03:23:03,760 --> 03:23:06,720
My my mom is named mothership

3308
03:23:10,560 --> 03:23:17,520
God who's rough during the all collab my mom called me and I think it was rora who likes sighs

3309
03:23:18,000 --> 03:23:20,000
She was like

3310
03:23:26,000 --> 03:23:32,560
I went on tumblr when I was in high school. It's irreversible. I can't fix anything. This is just who I am now

3311
03:23:33,280 --> 03:23:35,280
I

3312
03:23:35,680 --> 03:23:42,560
You're so tumblr brain rot. I gave you a quiz. I gave you a quiz and you almost got a hundred percent on it

3313
03:23:43,520 --> 03:23:45,520
I

3314
03:24:01,360 --> 03:24:07,520
Like literally I gave her this little quiz like how much tumblr brain rot do you have I gave her the quiz

3315
03:24:08,480 --> 03:24:09,920
and then

3316
03:24:09,920 --> 03:24:12,560
You almost got a hundred percent and I was like

3317
03:24:17,360 --> 03:24:24,800
I like to say I'm a historian. Yeah, I know I'm just brain rotted, but like let me live in denial

3318
03:24:28,320 --> 03:24:32,640
I think the only question she didn't get was like this newer newer quote

3319
03:24:33,600 --> 03:24:35,600
Hmm

3320
03:24:39,120 --> 03:24:42,800
What do you call like a what was it like a sad boy or something?

3321
03:24:43,600 --> 03:24:47,360
No, oh, oh, there was one question that was like asking

3322
03:24:48,160 --> 03:24:51,280
all like the pathetic wet cat like

3323
03:24:52,080 --> 03:24:54,000
um

3324
03:24:54,000 --> 03:24:59,680
Films or whatever. Yeah, I didn't I didn't get all of those because like, you know, I know pathetic shopping

3325
03:25:00,240 --> 03:25:02,240
Covered in milk, you know

3326
03:25:05,760 --> 03:25:10,000
I think it was like the answer was like, you know a sad meow meow or something

3327
03:25:10,400 --> 03:25:16,160
Yeah, yeah, it was like sad meow meow and I'm like, I don't I'm so sorry pookie. What the fuck is that?

3328
03:25:17,840 --> 03:25:21,280
But otherwise you got like almost a hundred percent on it

3329
03:25:22,800 --> 03:25:28,400
God it was bad. It really it was like, yeah, I was like at 85 or something. It was just that question

3330
03:25:28,720 --> 03:25:31,120
It was just my pathetic little meow meow, you know

3331
03:25:32,960 --> 03:25:34,960
That was so funny

3332
03:25:36,880 --> 03:25:41,840
Anyways girl, I think I'm gonna wrap up now because my tummy hearty now

3333
03:25:42,720 --> 03:25:49,040
Say, no, I've been laughing so much in all those squats. Are you kidding me? Yeah, they're like hurting now if we're in pain

3334
03:25:52,640 --> 03:25:57,440
So I don't know I don't know if you want to say goodbye to senpai's on your own or not

3335
03:25:57,840 --> 03:26:00,880
So I will I will I will beat you and do

3336
03:26:02,160 --> 03:26:04,160
