2186380	2188340	Okay, Xbox controller should be the ones
2188340	2189740	with the two squares on it.
2193020	2194500	Well, it says return to title screen.
2194500	2199040	Do I have to do it while in this screen instead?
2203900	2205700	Or maybe I just don't have items yet.
2207060	2207900	Whatever.
2207900	2210700	But welcome everyone.
2210700	2212700	I'm just having trouble with controls right now.
2212700	2215340	So I'm doing a little bit of studying.
2216860	2217800	A little bit of studying
2217800	2220020	because this game's a little bit funky,
2220020	2221300	but we'll get it, we'll get it.
2221300	2224540	I mean, I, admittedly, the games I played,
2224540	2228060	two to 51 games I played, Killer is Dead.
2228060	2230260	I thought I played Killer Seven at first,
2230260	2235260	but it turns out I was playing Killer is Dead instead.
2236700	2237860	I need a rhyme.
2239340	2244340	And I played The Silver Case.
2245980	2250300	I've also played, what's the sequel to The Silver Case?
2250300	2251140	That one.
2253060	2257780	And I think that's it.
2257780	2259180	I think that's it.
2259180	2262420	All I played of two to 51 games.
2265740	2271220	So those are the games that I've played.
2271220	2274660	I'm not very familiar with this type of gameplay.
2274660	2279660	I'm very bad at shooty games
2279860	2282940	because I've never played shooting a game before as well.
2286020	2288060	Did you understand The Silver Case?
2288060	2293060	I really liked The Silver Case the most.
2296420	2299540	I went through all 100 endings of the sequel.
2299540	2300380	What was it called again?
2300380	2301300	The 25th Ward.
2301300	2302140	Yeah.
2302140	2304780	It was great.
2305780	2310780	So I like that game, but it was more of a,
2321180	2325260	it was more of a, what do you call it?
2325260	2327460	More of a visual novel in my opinion.
2327460	2330260	It was more of a visual novel, a little bit of walking.
2330260	2331460	So I think that was fine.
2335780	2340780	So I did all the endings and then all I got was,
2342140	2343940	oh no, should I?
2343940	2346540	Oh no, that's a spoiler, right?
2346540	2347980	That's a spoiler, right?
2350340	2352380	I don't know if I can spoil it.
2362540	2363820	Yeah, I'm not gonna spoil it.
2364780	2365620	Mm.
2372420	2373740	Was it disappointing?
2373740	2375100	You can spoil it?
2375100	2376820	Mm, okay, okay.
2376820	2380860	Well, it's only because Senpai said that I can spoil it.
2380860	2384220	Well, all you have to get is Kamali telling you,
2384220	2385860	asking you for a loan.
2385860	2390860	Ha ha ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha, ha ha ha.
2390860	2394460	Getting us into the multi-level marketing, the MLM.
2395300	2396140	Project.
2398620	2399540	What was it?
2399540	2403180	Can I have a loan of like 50,000 and or something?
2403180	2404680	Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
2410820	2413820	Anyways, yeah, basically trying to convince us to go
2413820	2416660	into their little MLM project, eh?
2416660	2417580	Ha ha ha ha ha.
2420020	2422540	2 to 51 likes to mock player 200% in his games
2422540	2424300	and I did 100% it.
2424460	2428140	Yeah, I really did.
2429740	2431700	Give me a loan, the end, pretty much.
2431700	2435340	Ha ha ha ha ha ha, it was fun though, it was fun.
2435340	2436620	I don't regret it.
2438140	2440420	I don't regret it, but definitely,
2440420	2441580	I know what I'm getting into,
2441580	2443540	it's just that I gotta get used to the game play.
2443540	2444660	Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
2447020	2452020	Speaking of MLMs, have you guys, have my Senpais.

2470260	2474220	Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
2474220	2476060	Continuing that story, sorry about that.

2480460	2482620	Oh, just give me a second.
2485140	2487820	I'm gonna just close this window.
2487820	2488740	Sistracting.

2493180	2496220	Let me just, have you guys ever,
2496220	2501220	have my Senpais ever gotten tricked into,
2501220	2506220	into like going to a pyramid scheme party before?
2515140	2517420	Ha ha ha, because I have,
2517420	2522420	ha ha ha ha, I have an old friend from high school
2523380	2526100	was like, we love to meet up again.
2526100	2527820	And I said, yeah, sure.
2527820	2528980	Then I thought about it for a second.
2528980	2531820	I said, it's not a pyramid scheme, is it?
2532740	2535740	They assured me, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2535740	2539140	It's not a, it's not a pyramid scheme.
2539140	2541740	Just come over and we'll hang out, like good old times.
2541740	2542580	I said, okay.
2543580	2545820	So I drive all the way there.
2546700	2548940	All the way to there, in the middle of nowhere.
2550300	2551140	Ha ha ha.
2555700	2557900	I thought I was gonna die.
2559020	2561620	Because it was so far away, there were no lights
2561620	2562860	or anything, I was really worried.
2562860	2563980	I was like, where the heck?
2563980	2568500	So I got to a very opulent mansion.
2568500	2570900	I'm sorry, I'm telling you guys,
2570900	2572620	I'm telling you my supplies of story.
2572620	2573620	Well, it doesn't matter,
2573620	2575660	you're stuck in the basement anyways.
2579060	2581820	Opulent mansion with like barely anything in it.
2581820	2586820	So I walk in and I meet her friends
2589100	2593460	who are showing off their opulent mansion
2593460	2596660	with their quote unquote
2597540	2602540	real medieval night suits, whatever it is, you know?
2605660	2607260	They have one, they said it's authentic.
2607260	2610180	I was like, it ain't authentic, brother.
2611540	2614740	It's not authentic, it was that shiny.
2619300	2624300	Yeah, they're like, it's a medieval, it's old, it's there.
2627660	2632500	And then I see this product around and then
2633940	2638940	I basically just said, look, just give me the whole fricking,
2643900	2646860	give me the whole fricking story right now.
2647700	2652620	I'm tired, please just give me the whole spiel right now.
2652620	2655580	So they sat me down and then they gave me the whole spiel
2657500	2662980	and then I said, that's nice, I'm gonna go eat now.
2662980	2666540	And I ate all the charcuterie board
2666540	2669100	and like the energy drinks and I brought them home with me
2669100	2670220	and then I left.

3622140	3629740	the doctor may look a bit off but he's a true gentleman he won't do you wrong
3629740	3636380	prepare blood serums for you use them to give personas a heightened consciousness
3636380	3646060	level up this allows a member to achieve special attacks in the name of Harman

3652140	3659660	all right all right blood absorption master we're in a tight spot this blood
3659660	3668100	is scary stuff but without blood there is no tomorrow the persona can absorb the
3668100	3672460	blood out of the enemy and acts as a stabilizer to help handle multiple
3672460	3682340	personalities without blood your very life is in danger press start slash pause
3682340	3695460	to check the blood form you must use blood wisely in the name of Harman awakening

4565220	4567220	Just a little bit.
4568220	4571220	I'm trying to kinda still understand the mechanics.
4576220	4580220	It's a little tough, but I think I got quite a bit of it.
4581220	4582220	Ah!
4603220	4605220	Look, I'm a cleaner.
4605220	4607220	I can feel no remorse for seeing that.

4628220	4629220	This time real.
4629220	4630220	Probably.
4630220	4634220	I'm a little confused about how to do the...
4635220	4636220	the special move again.
4636220	4641220	I know it's R and then hitting the Y button three times, right?
4641220	4642220	Do I smash?
4644220	4645220	I'll try my best.
4645220	4646220	Whatever.
4646220	4648220	When it comes, it comes.
4648220	4649220	Okay.
4665220	4666220	I'm bad.
4675220	4676220	Ah!
4676220	4677220	Not again!
4678220	4679220	Ah!

4691220	4693220	They crawl so fast!
4708220	4709220	Ah!
4716220	4718220	This is too easy.
4729220	4731220	This is too easy.
4738220	4742220	Wait, where's the weakness?
4768220	4770220	A little shot.
4777220	4779220	You guys are so close!
4784220	4785220	I understand!
4785220	4786220	I understand it!
4794220	4796220	This is just a duplicator.
4796220	4797220	Bad girl!
4797220	4800220	An egg laying heaven smile.
4800220	4803220	Refitted to clamp down on the city.
4803220	4806220	This sucker pumped out the countless duplicates
4806220	4809220	that took this country down.
4810220	4811220	Hey, Smith.
4812220	4815220	It's your job to eradicate heaven smile, right?
4817220	4819220	And seek the queen.
4821220	4824220	The gatekeeper is in charge of the queen.
4826220	4828220	Give this to the gatekeeper.
4828220	4829220	He won't be disappointed.
4831220	4832220	Is that Pizza Hut?
4833220	4835220	Is that the Pizza Hut love?
4836220	4837220	Pull it.
4839220	4841220	Received Soul Shell.
4846220	4847220	Okay.
4856220	4859220	Is that Pizza Hut logo?
4859220	4860220	Yeah.
4863220	4864220	I did it!
4864220	4867220	Are you guys, are my supplies proud of me?
4867220	4868220	Can I get a head pat?
4878220	4879220	Okay, I did it.
4879220	4881220	I feel a little happy that I did it.
4882220	4884220	I guess I have to just go back now.
4886220	4889220	Yay, thank you, some pies.
4911220	4912220	Huh?
4913220	4914220	Huh?
4916220	4917220	Did I go this way?
4917220	4918220	Oh!
4919220	4920220	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
4920220	4921220	Wait.
4942220	4943220	Oh my gosh!
4944220	4947220	My little gimp son spooked me for a second!
4950220	4959220	Master, we're in a tight spot.
4959220	4962220	An ultra tight spot.
4962220	4964220	Life is precious.
4964220	4966220	And the enemies mean business.
4966220	4968220	They're called heaven smile.
4969220	4971220	Look at their eyes.
4972220	4974220	There's nothing heavenly about them.
4974220	4976220	In the name of Harmon.
4976220	4979220	Wait, maybe I should go back.
4979220	4981220	Maybe I should go back and save?
4982220	4983220	What do you think?
4993220	4996220	Maybe I should go back to the save.
4998220	4999220	Yeah.
4999220	5003220	Since I'm very new, I just beat that little...
5010220	5011220	Yeah.
5018220	5019220	Okay.
5039220	5040220	Harmon's room?
5040220	5042220	Is that the one I need to go to?
5042220	5043220	Yes.
5047220	5048220	Samantha.
5050220	5051220	Okay.
5055220	5057220	Let's overwrite this one.
5058220	5059220	Yes.
5059220	5060220	We're good.
5070220	5072220	Okay, we're good now.
5077220	5079220	How's your head feeling so far, Mercy?
5079220	5080220	I think it's okay.
5080220	5081220	Okay.
5098220	5101220	I don't know if this game is...
5103220	5104220	What do you call it?
5105220	5106220	Um...
5106220	5109220	If it would be like a game that
5109220	5112220	a major company would fund nowadays.
5112220	5114220	But it seems really cool.
5115220	5117220	Once you get used to it, I think
5117220	5120220	once you get used to the controls, it takes a while, but I get it.
5123220	5124220	Huh?
5134220	5135220	Ah!
5161220	5162220	Hey, I'm not...
5164220	5165220	Okay.
5188220	5189220	Any motherfuckers?
5189220	5191220	Any other motherfuckers here?
5192220	5193220	Thank you.
5198220	5199220	Oh!
5199220	5200220	Oh my God!
5200220	5202220	I could have just saved up here?
5202220	5203220	Wow!
5208220	5209220	Jeez, are you...
5209220	5210220	She's scared.
5210220	5211220	This is the...
5211220	5213220	This is the scary, right?
5213220	5214220	This is the scary one, right?
5214220	5216220	Is she gonna attack me?
5222220	5224220	Do I talk to her?
5224220	5226220	Should I talk to her?
5230220	5232220	Okay, well, I'll talk to her.
5238220	5239220	Never mind.
5239220	5241220	I'm just gonna go to the telly.
5243220	5245220	Who the hell is this?
5251220	5253220	I've changed my makeup.
5253220	5254220	Did you notice?
5257220	5259220	What did you say?
5259220	5261220	Later.
5261220	5262220	Oh, they're all Smith!
5262220	5264220	I just realized they're all Smith.
5267220	5269220	Okay, we're slowly unlocking them.
5269220	5271220	Understood.
5282220	5283220	No, okay.
5294220	5296220	Is there anything else she has in here?
5296220	5297220	No?
5304220	5305220	Can I talk to her?
5305220	5307220	Or is she just gonna...
5308220	5311220	Is she just gonna just, like, stare at me like that?
5314220	5316220	Or is she just gonna...
5318220	5319220	Oh, shit.
5319220	5320220	Oh, shit.
5320220	5321220	No!
5323220	5324220	Okay.
5338220	5340220	I had a moment.
5340220	5341220	I'm sorry.
5341220	5343220	I forgot how the game worked.
5345220	5346220	I'm sorry.
5346220	5348220	I forgot how the game worked.
5349220	5351220	I forgot how the game worked.
5367220	5369220	I forgot how it worked.
5379220	5381220	What the heck is that?
5394220	5396220	I nearly fucking died!
5409220	5410220	Ah!
5413220	5415220	What the fuck?
5426220	5428220	I'm lost now.
5431220	5433220	I got lost.
5433220	5435220	That was a truck!
5438220	5440220	X to pull up map.
5442220	5444220	Where am I?
5463220	5466220	Holy shit, Travis scared me again!
5468220	5470220	Ah!
5472220	5474220	Let's talk serious for a second.
5475220	5478220	Heaven's smile, they're holy warriors.
5478220	5480220	Shit, ain't that pretty wicked?
5480220	5483220	Warriors who fight with the holy will on their side
5483220	5485220	and use death as a weapon.
5485220	5486220	Their target?
5486220	5489220	The very dignity of the country itself.
5489220	5491220	Well, why should you understand the meaning?
5491220	5493220	Shit, you're a killer after all.
5497220	5500220	Oh my gosh, he just fucking scared me!
5505220	5507220	I guess this means...
5510220	5513220	Is green a color I didn't know?
5535220	5537220	Hahahaha!
5540220	5541220	Come on.
5541220	5543220	You gotta help me.
5546220	5547220	Ah!
5551220	5552220	Bean.
5554220	5555220	Oh!
5564220	5566220	Who are you?
5567220	5569220	Oh, like old times, huh?
5569220	5571220	Tell me how's old Smith?
5572220	5575220	Things going good with Mills, no?
5576220	5578220	That old Smith, not much of a successor.
5579220	5581220	But good man, yes.
5583220	5585220	Thank you, much gratitude.
5586220	5588220	Ready for today's hint?
5589220	5592220	I checked the candlesticks.
5593220	5596220	A strange design indeed is...
5596220	5598220	It is hidden there.
5598220	5601220	The order is hidden here.
5601220	5603220	Want to know more?
5604220	5606220	Then use this mask.
5606220	5608220	I'll be right back.
5608220	5610220	I'll be right back.
5610220	5612220	Want to know more?
5613220	5615220	Then use this mask.
5618220	5621220	Shoot the mask, and the mask will tell you.
5623220	5625220	But watch out!
5625220	5627220	This mask's lust for blood.
5628220	5630220	Thicker blood.
5631220	5633220	Demon lust for blood, yes?
5634220	5636220	If you're brave, shoot the mask.
5636220	5638220	Shoot the mask.
5640220	5642220	It'll tell you everything.
5645220	5647220	Am I close to a save point?
5647220	5649220	Hold on.
5650220	5652220	Where am I exactly?
5666220	5668220	You're...
5668220	5671220	You're in the yellow by the hand icon.
5681220	5683220	This map's hard to read.
5686220	5689220	You're next to the hand and ring symbol, I think.
5697220	5699220	Okay.
5700220	5703220	How much further is the save?
5708220	5710220	Okay.
5710220	5712220	I'm facing south, okay.
5715220	5717220	Yeah, I have to...
5717220	5719220	I have seen more useful maps in games, I admit.
5719220	5721220	Yeah, that's kinda hard.
5721220	5723220	So...
5724220	5726220	Okay, I'll shoot it.
5726220	5729220	It's not gonna come attack me, right?
5743220	5745220	Is it gonna attack me?
5745220	5747220	Okay.
5752220	5755220	I've beaten this game a million times.
5755220	5758220	I'm so glad I have, I have senpai's,
5758220	5760220	seasoned senpai's for this game,
5760220	5764220	because I am a little bit confuzzled at times.
5764220	5766220	Okay.
5774220	5776220	Okay.
5776220	5778220	So how do I shoot the mask?
5791220	5793220	Just aim like normal, okay.
5795220	5797220	Okay.
5797220	5799220	With your gun, okay.
5799220	5802220	I know with my gun, but I'm like, do I...
5802220	5804220	Like...
5804220	5806220	Like this?
5814220	5816220	Wait.
5817220	5819220	Did he just...
5819220	5822220	Did he just give me the middle finger?
5822220	5825220	So, you are the worthless loser.
5825220	5827220	What a pitiful existence.
5827220	5829220	I am the true mask.
5832220	5834220	And I shall guide you.
5836220	5838220	The ring of fire
5838220	5842220	and number shown on the candlestick.
5842220	5845220	From one to five,
5845220	5849220	follow the order and ignite the flames.
5849220	5852220	Tomorrow, it could be you.
5853220	5855220	Son of a bitch,
5855220	5858220	he's just given me the middle finger.
5872220	5874220	This one?
5879220	5881220	This one?
5889220	5891220	Insufficient flame.
5893220	5895220	Eh?
5896220	5899220	I didn't even know there was a room there!
5908220	5910220	Shit.
5918220	5920220	Sorry.
5920220	5922220	At a moment.
5922220	5924220	Oops.
5925220	5927220	Sorry.
5939220	5941220	Please help me.
5941220	5943220	It suddenly disappeared.
5944220	5946220	A white light flashed before me.
5946220	5948220	Everything is transparent.
5948220	5950220	I held his hand.
5951220	5953220	Whose hand was it?
5954220	5957220	Then, before I knew it, I was lost again.
5957220	5959220	Please help me.
5959220	5961220	I can't see a thing.
5967220	5970220	I don't think I finished exploring here.
5974220	5977220	What the fuck happened?
5977220	5979220	Oops.
5980220	5983220	What happened?
5983220	5986220	Wait, was that the woman I saw before? Never mind.
5986220	5988220	I know what happened.
5995220	5998220	I don't remember which way I went.
6005220	6008220	It's locked from the other side.
6009220	6011220	Okay.
6016220	6018220	Power.
6039220	6041220	What was that?
6044220	6046220	Did I go to here already?
6048220	6050220	I feel like I've already been here.
6050220	6052220	Yeah, you have.
6052220	6054220	I've been here already.
6054220	6056220	Okay.
6056220	6058220	Wow, I'm silly, Billy.
6058220	6060220	What's that?
6060220	6062220	What's that?
6062220	6064220	Did I go to here already?
6066220	6068220	I feel like I've already been here.
6068220	6070220	Did I go to here already?
6070220	6072220	Yeah, you have.
6072220	6074220	I've been here already.
6074220	6076220	Okay.
6076220	6078220	Wow, I'm silly, Billy.
6078220	6080220	I got really confused.
6080220	6082220	Sorry.
6108220	6110220	Oh, right.
6110220	6112220	Travis was here.
6112220	6114220	My bad.
6114220	6116220	That was the wrong way.
6138220	6140220	Okay.
6148220	6150220	Okay.
6150220	6152220	I'm starting to get it.
6162220	6164220	Bro!
6164220	6166220	Master!
6166220	6168220	We're in a tight spot.
6168220	6170220	A major tight spot.
6170220	6172220	He's here.
6172220	6174220	Yes, him!
6174220	6176220	Master, you can't.
6178220	6180220	You're going to go and kill him?
6182220	6184220	What?
6184220	6186220	Impossible.
6186220	6188220	You're a fool.
6188220	6190220	And you're a go-
6190220	6192220	You can't read.
6192220	6194220	Impossible. You're sure to fail.
6194220	6196220	You know nothing of his strength.
6196220	6198220	All stupid, stupid master.
6198220	6200220	That mill's really fooled you.
6202220	6204220	In the name of the fool.
6210220	6212220	Should I...
6212220	6214220	Do I have flames?
6214220	6216220	Does do...
6216220	6218220	Do I have flames?
6218220	6220220	Hahaha.
6220220	6222220	Nobody has faith in me.
6222220	6224220	It's fine.
6224220	6226220	I don't even have faith in myself.
6240220	6242220	This way?
6242220	6244220	Oh, carry your pigeon.
6246220	6248220	Give me the pigeon.
6250220	6252220	Dear Amir.
6252220	6254220	It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance
6254220	6256220	and many thanks for choosing me for the job.
6256220	6258220	My name is Johnny Gagnan.
6258220	6260220	Otherwise known as
6260220	6262220	Speedster.
6262220	6264220	Okay.
6264220	6266220	I get excited when I slit a guy's throat.
6266220	6268220	I know that may be sick,
6268220	6270220	but I do the best work in town.
6270220	6272220	This is a report on the job.
6272220	6274220	I'm sure you'll like what I have to say.
6274220	6276220	I watch them like a hawk.
6276220	6278220	So I think a hefty reward is an order.
6278220	6280220	There are seven in the Smith's Indian.
6280220	6282220	Dear Smith.
6282220	6284220	Who uses a large caliber revolver?
6284220	6286220	Hi, Dace.
6286220	6288220	No, not dear.
6288220	6290220	Dan Smith.
6290220	6292220	Wow.
6292220	6294220	Gagnan, these nuts.
6294220	6296220	Shut up!
6296220	6298220	Hahaha.
6298220	6300220	Feeling a little too relatable to the text?
6300220	6302220	Maybe a little bit.
6320220	6322220	Who uses a large automatic rifle?
6322220	6324220	Okay.
6324220	6326220	Hi, Dace Smith.
6326220	6328220	Who uses a large automatic rifle?
6328220	6330220	Colin Smith.
6330220	6332220	Who uses two full auto pistols?
6332220	6334220	Masked a Smith.
6334220	6336220	Who uses grenades?
6336220	6338220	Kevin Smith.
6338220	6340220	Who uses knives?
6340220	6342220	What are these names?
6350220	6352220	Coyote Smith.
6352220	6354220	Who uses a modified gun?
6354220	6356220	Christian Smith. Who uses a small pistol?
6356220	6358220	They are an armed force
6358220	6360220	that rivals a small army.
6364220	6366220	You wouldn't want to be on their bad side.
6366220	6368220	In conclusion, it is in
6368220	6370220	the interest of the United States
6370220	6372220	to keep them around.
6372220	6374220	There's no telling when they might come in handy.
6380220	6382220	Meet the Smiths.
6382220	6384220	Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
6384220	6386220	I'll be contacting you again.
6386220	6388220	Johnny Gagnan.
6390220	6392220	Oh!
6392220	6394220	Obtained career memo.
6398220	6400220	I guess I got to turn back then.
6406220	6408220	Can I save now?
6412220	6414220	Maybe not?
6414220	6416220	Maybe not?
6424220	6426220	I want to see the telly.
6426220	6428220	Don't make me say it again.
6428220	6430220	Wait here.
6430220	6432220	I've changed my makeup.
6432220	6434220	Did you notice?
6436220	6438220	Kevin!
6438220	6440220	What did you say?
6440220	6442220	Later.
6442220	6444220	Peace.
6448220	6450220	Masked a Smith.
6450220	6452220	I can wake them up.
6452220	6454220	Can I wake them up, guys?
6454220	6456220	Is it in my best interest
6456220	6458220	to wake them up?
6468220	6470220	Don't make me say it again.
6470220	6472220	Wait here.
6472220	6474220	I've changed my makeup.
6474220	6476220	What did you say?
6476220	6478220	Later.
6478220	6480220	Masked a Smith.
6488220	6490220	Oh!
6490220	6492220	He's really wearing a luchador mask.
6496220	6498220	Wow.
6498220	6500220	Later.
6500220	6502220	What about this one? Can I wake this one up?
6502220	6504220	Kevin, you're a little bit gangly.
6512220	6514220	Why are you so tall?
6528220	6530220	Is Kevin any good?
6532220	6534220	He's so...
6534220	6536220	He's so...
6536220	6538220	He's so gangly.
6538220	6540220	Later.
6540220	6542220	Peace.
6542220	6544220	Destiny.
6544220	6546220	Did he just say destiny?
6548220	6550220	There's 11 channels. Does that mean I have?
6554220	6556220	Don't make me say it again.
6556220	6558220	Wait here.
6558220	6560220	I've changed my makeup.
6560220	6562220	Wait here.
6568220	6570220	What did you say?
6570220	6572220	Later.
6572220	6574220	Destiny.
6574220	6576220	Destiny.
6576220	6578220	That's all he said. It was just destiny.
6582220	6584220	Are you sure you'll be calling anyone gangly?
6586220	6588220	I have the right to insult anyone.
6588220	6590220	I have the right to insult anyone.
6590220	6592220	Also, it's Killer7, but there's
6592220	6594220	11 channels.
6598220	6600220	Great serum from Blood by pressing
6600220	6602220	the A button.
6604220	6606220	Select Personality
6606220	6608220	and press the A button.
6608220	6610220	Wait here.
6610220	6612220	I've changed my makeup. Did you know?
6612220	6614220	What did you say?
6614220	6616220	Later.
6616220	6618220	Peace.
6618220	6620220	Who should I go?
6620220	6622220	What did you say?
6622220	6624220	Later.
6624220	6626220	Should there be someone I choose for now?
6628220	6630220	I'm letting my senpais
6630220	6632220	backseat me right now.
6632220	6634220	What did you say?
6636220	6638220	I've changed my makeup.
6638220	6640220	I've changed my makeup.
6640220	6642220	What did you say?
6642220	6644220	Destiny.
6644220	6646220	Destiny.
6646220	6648220	We'll use
6648220	6650220	Mask.
6652220	6654220	I just like
6654220	6656220	teleported in.
6656220	6658220	I
6660220	6662220	have such bad posture.
6672220	6674220	I
6686220	6688220	What happened?
6688220	6690220	Why did it scan?
6690220	6692220	I'm so sorry.
6692220	6694220	I don't understand why it didn't scan.
6694220	6696220	I
6700220	6702220	What the?
6702220	6704220	Why didn't it scan?
6704220	6706220	At that time.
6706220	6708220	No, no, no.
6708220	6710220	I pressed the...
6710220	6712220	Maybe I didn't hold it down enough.
6712220	6714220	That was my bad.
6716220	6718220	What the hell?
6718220	6720220	I
6722220	6724220	Oh my gosh.
6744220	6746220	I'm hitting back.
6746220	6748220	I gotta use
6748220	6750220	Mask
6750220	6752220	this way.
6764220	6766220	He's so slow.
6766220	6768220	Wait, I can change right here?
6770220	6772220	How do I change right here?
6776220	6778220	I
6784220	6786220	What button?
6788220	6790220	Oh, I found it.
6806220	6808220	Should I use consmith then?
6816220	6818220	How do I heal from the screen?
6830220	6832220	I have...
6832220	6834220	Okay, there's some stuff.
6834220	6836220	I have any items?
6836220	6838220	Photos.
6838220	6840220	Who the heck is this?
6840220	6842220	You know, he kind of looks like
6842220	6844220	what's his name? The gumshoe guy
6844220	6846220	from Ace Attorney.
6854220	6856220	I just...
6856220	6858220	wall?
6858220	6860220	wall?
6860220	6862220	Blood?
6870220	6872220	Oh.
6876220	6878220	Okay, I understand.
6878220	6880220	I guess I can try.
6880220	6882220	Hi, Dave.
6882220	6884220	Whoa! You didn't fucking kill him!
6884220	6886220	You didn't fucking kill him?
6890220	6892220	I feel like I just fucking killed him.
6896220	6898220	Wait, did I just

7617540	7619540	I'm a cleaner.
7619540	7625540	Does Garcian have no level up thingies?
7644540	7655540	Yeah, whatever, we'll level Dan up a little, but I'm kind of used to him.
7667540	7669540	Oh wait, I should probably save.
7669540	7670540	I'm so silly.
7670540	7672540	What a silly Billy I am.
7672540	7673540	Save!
7675540	7678540	Samantha, please be kind to me, I'm gonna save!

7707540	7709540	Uh, these stairs?
7715540	7716540	An object.
7721540	7722540	Grier?
7732540	7733540	Eh?
7743540	7746540	Well hello, Smith.
7747540	7749540	Looks like a cloudy, cloudy day!
7749540	7751540	What is really too bad, sad face?
7751540	7754540	Uh, day to hang out in the laundry.
7754540	7756540	Great day to use a dryer though.
7756540	7762540	But you know, I just love this one.
7762540	7764540	I'll never let anybody have it.
7764540	7765540	You know why?
7765540	7767540	Well you should.
7768540	7770540	I love to stay inside.
7770540	7772540	You left this behind, didn't you?
7776540	7777540	I got it!
7777540	7779540	I got it, I got the firing!
7780540	7785540	If you finish your business, could you hurry up and leave?
7785540	7787540	You're very much in the way.
7787540	7789540	Assassins should have better manners.
7792540	7794540	Okay, thank you.
7797540	7800540	And then I go here, items.
7801540	7803540	Like that, right?
7803540	7805540	Should I head back now?
7806540	7808540	Should I head back now?
7813540	7814540	Should I save?
7814540	7815540	I'll save again.
7815540	7818540	Sorry, I'm saving all the time so I don't forget.
7836540	7839540	Wait, should I turn the dryer back on for her?
7839540	7840540	Maybe I should.
7840540	7844540	Oh my gosh, I'm such a rude, I'm such a rude friend.
7851540	7853540	I forgot to turn it off!
7860540	7862540	Never mind, I'm leaving.
7866540	7869540	Where the fuck did that come from?
7873540	7875540	Whatever, luckily I saved.
7895540	7897540	What the fuck?
7908540	7910540	Hey, my bitches!
7925540	7927540	What the fuck?
7940540	7942540	Now what?
7950540	7952540	What was that?
7955540	7957540	What the fuck?
7963540	7965540	What fell?
7966540	7968540	Where did it fall?
7985540	7989540	Laundry, okay, we're heading back to the laundry.
8002540	8004540	What is that?
8005540	8007540	Odd engraving.
8009540	8014540	Wait, now that I have this, should I backtrack to the candles?
8015540	8017540	What the fuck?
8021540	8023540	It's an odd engraving.
8023540	8026540	Yeah, we should do the backtrack.
8026540	8028540	Man, what a pain!
8046540	8048540	Ha ha ha!
8070540	8072540	What was that sound?
8076540	8078540	My map?
8078540	8080540	My map?
8104540	8107540	I'm just gonna take the stairs.
8108540	8110540	Ha ha ha!
8133540	8136540	Okay, I didn't backtrack too far.
8136540	8138540	Handle.
8138540	8140540	Air conditioning?
8142540	8144540	Oh, come on.
8151540	8157540	One, two, three, four, five.
8159540	8161540	Oh!
8166540	8168540	What's air conditioner?
8187540	8190540	Did I need it on or off?
8196540	8198540	Oh.
8210540	8212540	Oh!
8212540	8215540	But I don't need it anymore, right?
8227540	8229540	Ha ha ha!
8232540	8234540	Wait, which way?
8247540	8249540	Oh.
8257540	8261540	He's still flipping you off, like a bitch.
8261540	8263540	I mean, he should.
8263540	8266540	I'm not that great of a person.
8266540	8269540	Go back, you forgot the puzzle piece.
8269540	8271540	Huh?
8295540	8297540	Dogo?
8300540	8303540	What shelf? The one in the room?
8308540	8310540	Oh, wow!
8313540	8315540	Odd engraving.
8329540	8331540	Ha ha ha!
8347540	8350540	Look at how much of a pro I am now.
8350540	8353540	I improved so much, Senpai.
8360540	8362540	Oh.
8370540	8372540	Oh, there's so many of you.
8390540	8392540	Ah!
8405540	8407540	Can I do this control panel?
8407540	8409540	Oh!
8419540	8421540	Oh!
8428540	8430540	Sorry, your leg.
8435540	8437540	Man!
8445540	8447540	That was kind of brutal.
8448540	8450540	Warehouse.
8454540	8456540	Oh?
8464540	8466540	Oh my gosh!
8466540	8469540	It was out of you, you scared me again!
8469540	8471540	Master!
8471540	8473540	We're in a tight spot.
8473540	8475540	Mask is for your disc-
8475540	8477540	Gizli rack.
8477540	8479540	When there's a crack, it's his shul.
8479540	8481540	He's filthy powerful.
8481540	8484540	No destroy, all of kingdom come.
8484540	8486540	And then some.
8487540	8490540	He's a liability if you ask me.
8490540	8492540	In the name of Harman.
8492540	8494540	Oh!
8494540	8496540	I get it.
8496540	8498540	I get it.
8498540	8502540	I'm picking up while you're putting down game.
8503540	8505540	I change.
8505540	8507540	Mask here.
8514540	8516540	I get it.
8516540	8518540	I'm so, yeah.
8519540	8521540	Now what?
8521540	8523540	I just...
8523540	8525540	Wait, but like now what?
8533540	8535540	Oh!
8553540	8556540	What the hell is that?
8563540	8565540	Oh!
8572540	8574540	Carry a pigeon.
8579540	8581540	Dear Amir.
8586540	8588540	We have a problem.
8588540	8591540	A terrible thing has happened. Pussy!
8592540	8595540	My pigeon's name is Pussy!
8613540	8615540	Pigeonosee?
8615540	8617540	Pigeonosee?
8618540	8621540	Who named this?
8621540	8623540	Anyways.
8623540	8626540	Who named these pigeons?
8626540	8629540	Dear Amir. Amir, we have a problem.
8629540	8631540	A terrible thing has happened.
8631540	8633540	I can hardly believe it.
8633540	8635540	But the money is not in my account.
8635540	8637540	What the fuck do you mean?
8648540	8651540	I need your help. You got my last messages, didn't you?
8651540	8653540	I trusted you.
8653540	8655540	Now don't let me down. Promise me.
8655540	8657540	Wire me the money immediately.
8657540	8660540	125 bucks is peanuts, I'm telling you.
8660540	8664540	Smith's syndicate operates in strange ways.
8664540	8667540	Garcia and Smith manages the other six personas
8667540	8671540	and mainly acts as a negotiator for work requests.
8671540	8675540	Garcia never eliminates people himself.
8675540	8677540	His role is to retrieve the bodies.
8677540	8679540	Even if another persona is killed,
8679540	8684540	it appears he is able to bring him back to life
8684540	8686540	like a wizard, I tell you.
8686540	8689540	However, it's my hunch that somebody offstage
8689540	8692540	is calling the shots and controlling Garcia.
8692540	8695540	There must be a hidden mastermind separate from the active team.
8695540	8699540	And it's likely that this mastermind assigns the jobs.
8699540	8703540	Garcia is very loyal and he values the organization,
8703540	8706540	controls the personas to keep the organization safe.
8706540	8709540	He's a middle manager, you see.
8709540	8712540	A member switch using the medium of television.
8712540	8716540	I have yet to determine what governs the switches.
8716540	8722540	Wizard, Shadow Money, Wizard, Shadow, Wizard Money Gang?
8722540	8728540	Shadow, Shadow, Shadow, Shadow, Shadow Gang, Gang, Gang, Gang.
8728540	8735540	We love casting spells and sh**.
8735540	8752540	The Smith Syndicate is composed of one sensible person and six freaks.
8752540	8756540	I never seen the personas interact with each other.
8757540	8759540	Alright.
8761540	8765540	Soon, I expect to unmask the myth behind the strange group.
8765540	8769540	I'll be contacting you again, Johnny Guy, Gangman.
8772540	8774540	Tane, carry your memo.
8776540	8778540	Hold on, let me switch to someone else.
8781540	8784540	I like using Dan because he's kind of easier to use.
8787540	8788540	Oh!
8803540	8805540	Travis, what are you doing here?
8807540	8810540	I was the chief's first catch.
8810540	8812540	I can still remember.
8812540	8814540	The chief's quivering hand.
8814540	8818540	The pain went straight up my spine and then back down again.
8818540	8820540	Be honest, that should feel good.
8822540	8826540	It all happened on the smothering hot night.
8830540	8832540	Is that all you're gonna tell me, Travis?
8832540	8834540	Is that all you're gonna tell me?
8835540	8837540	Okay, I guess.
8844540	8845540	Oh.
8866540	8869540	Master, we're in a tight spot.
8869540	8871540	Like, tighter than tight.
8871540	8872540	Uh-oh.
8873540	8874540	Uh-oh?
8874540	8875540	Real?
8876540	8879540	Oh, I have offended my master with foul words,
8879540	8881540	but please, you must understand.
8883540	8886540	Just thinking about him drives me absolutely mad.
8886540	8889540	He fixes the sink to sink this country,
8889540	8891540	and so he's sending his unending blah-blah-blah
8891540	8893540	with no sign of letting up.
8896540	8898540	How many followers does he command?
8899540	8901540	Beware of old friends.
8902540	8904540	In the name of Harman.
8929540	8931540	Can I save?
8931540	8932540	Here.
8939540	8940540	Here.
8940540	8942540	Get my blood.
8943540	8945540	Take my blood doctor.
8946540	8948540	Blood doctor, blood doctor.
8949540	8951540	Take all my blood doctor.
8952540	8954540	Wait, I need the TV again, sorry.
8958540	8960540	Don't make me say it again.
8960540	8961540	I'm a cleaner.
8961540	8963540	Wait here.
8964540	8965540	I'm gonna...
8966540	8968540	improve my skills again.
8981540	8982540	Good enough.
8982540	8983540	Okay.
8990540	8992540	Now we get information here, right?
9012540	9014540	Get away!
9014540	9016540	What is this thing?
9018540	9020540	Why is it exploding?
9026540	9028540	Why does it explode like that?
9043540	9046540	This is too easy.
9046540	9047540	What?
9068540	9069540	What?
9069540	9072540	Master, we're in a tight spot.
9073540	9075540	Watch out for barefoot.
9075540	9076540	Kaede.
9076540	9078540	I've sensed this presence before.
9078540	9080540	My ex-wife, Mizaru, was near.
9080540	9081540	What?
9081540	9083540	Is now the servant of barefoot.
9085540	9086540	What?
9086540	9088540	Let my wife serve you through barefoot.
9089540	9091540	Use the Y button for a death shower.
9091540	9093540	In the name of Harman.
9093540	9095540	What a what?
9102540	9103540	What?
9112540	9114540	This is too easy.
9132540	9133540	What?
9146540	9147540	Nice.
9157540	9159540	Wait, I went the wrong way.
9159540	9161540	I'm gonna go this way.
9162540	9164540	Death shower, he said.
9166540	9168540	What is death shower?
9175540	9177540	How'd I use her skill?
9178540	9179540	Gotta head out.
9179540	9180540	Good luck, Koi.
9180540	9181540	Goodbye!
9181540	9184540	Sorry, I'm very not paying attention to chat,
9184540	9186540	because I'm confused.
9186540	9187540	Confused.
9200540	9202540	What is this?
9207540	9209540	You don't need to aim for this one.
9209540	9210540	Just hit Y.
9210540	9211540	Oh.
9213540	9214540	Oh!
9216540	9217540	Oh!
9222540	9223540	Oh!
9226540	9227540	Oh!
9232540	9234540	Let's grab this bullet.
9243540	9245540	Oh, I should probably change out.
9246540	9247540	Oh!
9271540	9273540	It's locked by padlock.
9276540	9278540	Guess I can't go there yet.
9300540	9302540	Not bad, me.
9306540	9308540	Oh, sorry.
9313540	9315540	I was like, oh my gosh!
9319540	9321540	Oh my gosh!
9323540	9325540	Hi, Travis.
9326540	9327540	Can you see it?
9327540	9329540	No, I can't see it.
9329540	9330540	Oh, sorry.
9330540	9332540	I was like, oh my gosh!
9332540	9333540	Hi, Travis.
9335540	9336540	Can you see it?
9336540	9338540	Words written in blood.
9340540	9342540	Obviously had a point to make.
9344540	9347540	But only two letters are written in real blood.
9347540	9349540	Rest are fake.
9352540	9354540	You need the girl for this one.
9363540	9365540	Does someone in my group pick locks?
9365540	9367540	I didn't pay attention.
9367540	9369540	I didn't pay attention.
9390540	9393540	What the hell is she doing with her hands?
9395540	9396540	Blood absorbed.
9397540	9405540	No, no what? No pussy? No head?
9428540	9430540	Well, I'll go back.
9438540	9441540	If I have someone, I'll just use them.
9458540	9461540	Oh!
9476540	9480540	Yay, blood! I think.
9487540	9493540	Travis? Huh? L.A.? Can't you see I'm busy?
9493540	9496540	You ought to mind your manners.
9499540	9503540	You guys are just a pack of losers.
9503540	9507540	You don't even know how to make use of your abilities.
9507540	9512540	There are traitors in heaven's smile.
9512540	9516540	The chief's very own inside guys.
9518540	9521540	They have a white body splattered with red paint.
9521540	9524540	A reminder of treacherous speed.
9524540	9526540	The girl!
9526540	9529540	Kite! Funny thing is the splotches look like beautiful red roses.
9529540	9533540	If you find a chameleon smile, use your ability.
9533540	9538540	Kill one of them and you'll get loaded up. For real, man.
9542540	9545540	Oh.
9550540	9555540	Important question. Are you having fun, Mercy? Yeah.
9555540	9558540	Oops.
9564540	9567540	Oopsies.
9567540	9571540	I'm going to switch out characters because I'm not used to them yet.
9577540	9582540	I'm getting tired. Kind of tired, though. Usually I have lots...
9582540	9585540	What?
9592540	9596540	Which way did I need to go again? I'm lost!
9602540	9605540	Can I go here already?
9605540	9609540	Oh, come on.
9621540	9625540	I got used to the game so now I feel more comfortable.
9625540	9629540	Can I save here?
9629540	9632540	Okay.
9632540	9636540	I want to just save here, guys.
9636540	9643540	And I'll probably end the gameplay here and I'll probably start yapping.
9649540	9653540	Probably start yapping.
9653540	9657540	That was a lot.
9657540	9661540	Ha ha ha ha!
9661540	9666540	Yeah, main outfit saves the day!
9666540	9669540	Oh!
9679540	9683540	Now, how do I get out of here?
9684540	9689540	Yes! Like this. I saved, right? I totally did.
9702540	9705540	Yatta!
9705540	9709540	Right, let's go...
9709540	9712540	Over here.
9713540	9716540	Okay.
9716540	9719540	How was it? How was it, Senpai? Did you like the game?
9719540	9723540	I finally... I think I got the hang of it.
9723540	9727540	It took a little bit, but I got the hang of it.
9730540	9734540	I was really shocked when...
9734540	9741540	At the beginning, the beginning was... Oh, hold on. Let me just fix myself a little bit. Let me...
9742540	9747540	Actually, maybe I kind of like myself looking like this, right?
9754540	9761540	There, I'm bright and beautiful again. You see me in all my glory.
9761540	9764540	Senpai!
9764540	9769540	You did like the game, though, right? After I chose it for you!
9770540	9774540	It's like the lights turned on.
9778540	9781540	It was really tough, but I managed to figure it out.
9781540	9787540	It only took up to now to actually fully get comfortable with the game.
9790540	9794540	It was pretty brutal, not going to lie to you.
9794540	9798540	At the beginning, the game...
9798540	9801540	I didn't get it.
9801540	9808540	That tutorial was pretty bad, and then I only got it when they gave me the info dump tutorial.
9808540	9812540	Then I was like, okay, I get it now, I get it now.
9815540	9818540	I'm on guard games are really fun, though.
9818540	9823540	I really like kind of experimental games, because I...
9823540	9829540	I find that kind of like, weirder gameplay...
9829540	9835540	makes me more interested in like, what the story's going to tell.
9842540	9846540	It was really, it was really...
9846540	9849540	The lore is even crazier, for real?
9849540	9852540	Okay, I can't wait to try this game again.
9852540	9856540	It might be a little bit, but we'll definitely pick this up again.
9856540	9859540	This entire week is booked up.
9859540	9865540	It's booked up, so we're going to explore a variety of games together.
9865540	9869540	Because...
9869540	9876540	Well, I just want to showcase each game that I play.
9876540	9880540	That I play for my supplies, where I strapped you...
9880540	9887540	Strapped you into a chair, just like in Clockwork Orange.
9887540	9892540	What was it? The Ludo something technique?
9892540	9896540	I forced your eyes open, and only...
9896540	9902540	And every once in a while, I put eye drops, so your eyes get moistered.
9902540	9906540	Ludovico technique, yeah!
9906540	9909540	I'm so glad my supplies are so smart!
9909540	9911540	This is why I love you so much.
9917540	9920540	Wow, my supplies are really smart!
9920540	9923540	You memorize that.
9923540	9927540	I'm so proud. Good job.
9928540	9933540	That movie was really fun.
9933540	9935540	It was really fun.
9941540	9946540	I'm hoping tomorrow... Let me check my schedule again.
9946540	9951540	I always forget what I scheduled.
9952540	9956540	Because I'm kind of clumsy.
9956540	9963540	My schedules are weeks in advance.
9963540	9968540	So I choose my games weeks in advance.
9971540	9975540	Let's see. Tomorrow is Omori.
9975540	9979540	In truth, I played Omori before.
9979540	9981540	I don't remember much of it.
9981540	9987540	I remember rage quitting, because I fought a bunch of bears.
9987540	9990540	It was like fighting a bunch of ICs at once.
9990540	9992540	It was brutal.
10000540	10004540	So that's where...
10004540	10009540	Imagine like 10 ICs coming at you.
10009540	10011540	Over and over and over and over again.
10011540	10013540	It takes you out of breath.
10013540	10015540	By the end of it, you're like,
10015540	10017540	Okay, I need to go heal up.
10017540	10019540	Then you come back.
10019540	10024540	They spawn back 10 more bears.
10024540	10027540	10 more ICs, okay?
10028540	10033540	So I rage quit at that part.
10033540	10035540	Now I learned my lesson.
10035540	10038540	I'm not going to do that this time.
10038540	10041540	Wait, Serenity's in chat?
10041540	10043540	Serenity, Serenity, Serenity!
10043540	10045540	My baby!
10045540	10047540	My baby bunny!
10047540	10050540	My bunny bunny, honey!
10050540	10052540	Honey!
10056540	10058540	I love you!
10058540	10059540	The bear fight was rough.
10059540	10060540	I found her.
10060540	10061540	I found her. Yes, it was.
10061540	10063540	It was. I cried.
10066540	10069540	I'm so happy you're here.
10071540	10073540	I'm so happy you're here.
10074540	10076540	Oh, you're kind of up late.
10080540	10084540	I'm watching in bed. Have good sleeps then.
10084540	10087540	Have good sleeps then.
10089540	10092540	Tucks you in. Kisses you goodnight.
10103540	10105540	I'm so happy though.
10106540	10108540	Oh, I'm so, so happy.
10108540	10110540	Thank you Serenity for dropping by.
10110540	10112540	I love seeing you here all the time.
10112540	10113540	Thank you.
10113540	10115540	I'm sure my supplies love you too.
10115540	10118540	But yeah, don't try to steal my supplies away from me.
10118540	10120540	I will kill you.
10135540	10137540	Yeah, yeah!
10137540	10139540	Oh my gosh, I love you.
10141540	10146540	Yes, Senpai's got five minutes free time and out of the cage
10146540	10148540	until they go back again.
10152540	10156540	Serenity gets a basement visit permit or is she a resident?
10162540	10166540	Well, like she gets special privileges.
10166540	10170540	So like she's stuck in the basement, but she gets to go in and out freely.
10170540	10172540	Because I trust her.
10178540	10180540	Is our cage bedroom size?
10180540	10182540	It's dog cage size.
10187540	10189540	It's dog cage size.
10189540	10194540	It's a little, it's a little um, a little cozy in there.
10194540	10198540	I put some star glow in the dark star stickers
10198540	10203540	or for my senpais to feel like they're looking up at the night sky.
10206540	10208540	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
10208540	10210540	My senpais get a little doggy bed.
10210540	10212540	The plaid ones.
10212540	10215540	If you're, if you really get, if you're really feeling special.
10215540	10220540	Some, some days you get the velour one, the velour doggy bed.
10221540	10227540	With the little pillow and the stuffed animal.
10227540	10229540	That's every Fridays.
10229540	10231540	That's a treat.
10250540	10252540	As a treat. Yeah.
10255540	10256540	I'm so generous.
10256540	10260540	I know I treat, I'm, I'm such a good girlfriend.
10264540	10266540	I'm so happy though.
10268540	10270540	I'm such a good girlfriend.
10270540	10273540	I let you have all these wonderful treats.
10274540	10276540	In fact, I might give you a treat later.
10281540	10283540	Yeah.
10286540	10288540	Can we get McDonald's?
10291540	10293540	Everyone gets a happy meal.
10293540	10295540	Once a month.
10304540	10305540	The basement.
10305540	10307540	Everyone gets a happy meal.
10307540	10308540	Once a month.
10308540	10310540	You get a little toy to play with.
10312540	10313540	Can I have new clothes?
10313540	10314540	No.
10319540	10321540	Is that a little unhealthy at the McDonald's?
10321540	10323540	Well, it is a treat.
10323540	10325540	That's why it's a treat only once a month.
10329540	10330540	Yeah, everyone shares.
10330540	10332540	You got, everyone has to share.
10332540	10333540	Okay.
10333540	10337540	Everyone gets one little, little, little, little taste of the yogurt.
10338540	10344540	Everyone gets a tiny, tiny crumb of, of the fries.
10346540	10351540	And then have a little, little, little fight over the nuggets.
10360540	10362540	And the toy is shared amongst everyone.
10362540	10363540	Of course.
10369540	10371540	Can we not fight over it?
10373540	10376540	Well, if you, you're all good and willing to share,
10376540	10378540	you don't have to fight over it.
10379540	10381540	After all, it's a democracy here.
10394540	10396540	Kai won't be our toy?
10396540	10397540	Of course not.
10397540	10399540	You're my toy Senpai.
10416540	10418540	Can we vote for more time?
10418540	10419540	Yeah.
10419540	10421540	Democracy where, um,
10422540	10426540	Mercy's, Mercy's vote is worth 10 times more
10426540	10429540	than everyone else's combined.
10440540	10442540	I vote for last free time.
10442540	10443540	Oh.
10444540	10445540	Okay.
10445540	10447540	So last free time, that means you,
10447540	10449540	I can assign homework now.
10452540	10453540	Okay.
10469540	10472540	I can give Senpai's homework.
10472540	10474540	It's really easy.
10474540	10475540	It's really easy homework.
10475540	10476540	You'll love it.
10476540	10478540	You'll love it.
10478540	10482540	Watch every single episode of Cardcaptor Sakura.
10491540	10494540	Watch every single episode of Cardcaptor Sakura.
10494540	10497540	Come back with me with a thousand word,
10497540	10501540	a little essay about how you felt about it.
10502540	10504540	And then,
10504540	10506540	mostly your thousand word essay
10506540	10509540	must consist of why Sakura is the best
10512540	10514540	of about the movies.
10514540	10515540	They count.
10515540	10517540	It's just one long episode.
10523540	10525540	1,200 words?
10525540	10528540	Oh, you get bonus points then.
10528540	10530540	Your bonus point will be a little,
10530540	10532540	a little smooch.
10532540	10534540	A little smooch on your homework.
10538540	10540540	Can it be a group project instead?
10540540	10541540	No.
10544540	10546540	I can't call Sakura the best because you're the best.
10546540	10548540	Of course I'm the best.
10548540	10550540	But at the same time, we must,
10550540	10552540	if it wasn't for Sakura,
10552540	10554540	I wouldn't even be here.
10554540	10556540	Sakura actually,
10556540	10558540	got me through hard times.
10568540	10570540	The original, right?
10570540	10573540	Or will you do the Nirvana butchered version too?
10573540	10574540	Both.
10576540	10577540	Both.
10577540	10580540	When I said all episodes, I meant it in every single language.
10587540	10588540	Hahaha.
10593540	10594540	Instructions unclear.
10594540	10595540	Binge Chobits.
10595540	10597540	Oh, speaking of Chobits,
10597540	10599540	I just remember,
10599540	10602540	when I was a child,
10602540	10604540	I loved Chobits.
10604540	10606540	And I,
10606540	10609540	had no idea what Chobits was about.
10609540	10611540	So when you know,
10611540	10613540	little old,
10613540	10615540	baby Mercy went,
10615540	10618540	why is it such a big deal that,
10618540	10619540	there's a button there?
10619540	10620540	Of course there's a button there.
10620540	10622540	That's the last place I didn't look.
10625540	10627540	I had no idea.
10632540	10634540	I had no idea.
10634540	10635540	Every time,
10635540	10636540	the entire time,
10636540	10637540	I was like, wow,
10637540	10638540	she is so cute.
10638540	10640540	I hope she's so happy with Hideki.
10641540	10644540	And then I watched it,
10644540	10646540	re-watched it again,
10646540	10647540	and I was like,
10647540	10649540	I shouldn't have watched this.
10649540	10651540	Why did I watch this?
10651540	10652540	I shouldn't have watched this
10652540	10654540	when I was a wee little lass.
10660540	10661540	I was,
10661540	10663540	yeah,
10663540	10665540	I didn't tell this one,
10665540	10668540	but I don't think it's a really cringe story,
10668540	10669540	but,
10669540	10670540	I guess there's a lot of things
10670540	10671540	when I didn't,
10671540	10673540	I was very ignorant of,
10673540	10675540	more so than now.
10677540	10678540	For example,
10678540	10681540	I used to call every single person,
10681540	10683540	who was like,
10683540	10686540	a female caretaker of me,
10686540	10687540	for example, like,
10687540	10689540	a mommy, right?
10689540	10691540	So I would call my teacher's mommy,
10691540	10692540	I would call,
10694540	10696540	I would call my friends,
10696540	10698540	my friends,
10698540	10700540	mom, mommy as well,
10700540	10702540	because I thought,
10702540	10703540	because I read in a book,
10703540	10704540	it says like,
10704540	10706540	oh, what is a mommy?
10706540	10707540	What is a mother?
10707540	10708540	A mommy is,
10708540	10711540	is someone who takes care of you.
10711540	10712540	So I just associated it
10712540	10713540	for a long time,
10713540	10715540	with just like,
10715540	10718540	just like any woman who took care of me.
10721540	10722540	And then I think,
10722540	10724540	I only found out when I got like,
10724540	10725540	really,
10725540	10726540	I got lectured about it,
10726540	10727540	by a teacher who did not,
10727540	10729540	like being called mommy.
10736540	10737540	He called friends,
10737540	10739540	now I called my friends,
10739540	10740540	mom,
10740540	10741540	this as well,
10741540	10742540	so I would call mommy,
10742540	10744540	their mommy, mommy.
10745540	10747540	Oh my gosh, Strony!
10749540	10751540	Strony calls.
10752540	10754540	Welcome,
10754540	10755540	mommy!
10757540	10758540	Mommy!
10760540	10762540	Speaking of mommies,
10762540	10764540	mommies here, everybody,
10764540	10767540	everyone bow your head in respect,
10767540	10768540	every Senpai,
10768540	10770540	bow your head in respect.
10773540	10775540	Are you doing it Senpai?
10775540	10776540	Good,
10776540	10777540	mommy is off to brush her teeth,
10777540	10778540	and go to sleep.
10778540	10779540	Good, good, good,
10779540	10781540	make sure to floss as well.
10782540	10783540	Welcome everyone,
10783540	10785540	welcome to the stream,
10785540	10787540	I just finished,
10787540	10789540	not finished, but I,
10790540	10791540	I just,
10792540	10793540	temporarily,
10793540	10794540	put on hold,
10794540	10796540	my playthrough of
10796540	10797540	Killer Seven,
10798540	10799540	in order to yap.
10801540	10802540	Have fun Mercy,
10802540	10803540	love you,
10803540	10804540	love you too,
10804540	10805540	mommy!
10805540	10806540	I love you!
10812540	10813540	Of course,
10813540	10814540	Strony has like,
10814540	10815540	super strong endurance.
10815540	10816540	I,
10817540	10819540	am still getting used to my schedule,
10819540	10821540	so my endurance is not as,
10821540	10822540	as good.
10822540	10823540	My endurance,
10823540	10825540	maximum for me,
10825540	10826540	I can do,
10826540	10829540	if I'm really enthralled by a game,
10829540	10830540	is,
10831540	10833540	the max I did was,
10833540	10835540	I think I did 12 hours with the max,
10835540	10836540	and then,
10836540	10837540	like,
10837540	10838540	after that I was like,
10838540	10839540	I'm never doing that again,
10839540	10840540	so my max,
10840540	10841540	absolute limit,
10841540	10843540	is probably 8 hours.
10844540	10846540	Probably 8 hours.
10847540	10848540	Killer Seven,
10848540	10849540	good taste,
10849540	10850540	thank you,
10850540	10851540	actually,
10851540	10852540	I thought I played Killer Seven,
10852540	10853540	I was like,
10853540	10854540	yeah, I played Killer Seven,
10854540	10855540	like,
10855540	10856540	that's not a 51 game,
10856540	10857540	right?
10857540	10858540	Yeah, I played it before,
10858540	10859540	turns out I played,
10859540	10860540	Killer is dead,
10860540	10861540	and that's a completely different game,
10861540	10862540	so, oops.
10862540	10863540	Hahaha.
10868540	10871540	What's the normal gaming session length for you?
10871540	10872540	Mmm,
10872540	10874540	I'd say about,
10874540	10875540	2 to 3 hours.
10876540	10878540	That's normally what normal is,
10878540	10880540	unless I'm super enthralled by it,
10880540	10881540	but, um,
10881540	10883540	since I,
10883540	10885540	get a little,
10885540	10887540	I'm a little bit,
10887540	10890540	not used to the schedule yet,
10890540	10893540	and not used to my new routine yet,
10893540	10894540	I'm,
10894540	10896540	I'm forcing myself to stop,
10896540	10898540	within like,
10898540	10900540	max 4 hours.
10900540	10901540	Hahaha.
10903540	10905540	Mostly because,
10905540	10906540	um,
10908540	10909540	I have things to do,
10909540	10910540	and I want to prepare
10910540	10911540	a lot of things for Senpai.
10914540	10916540	So I want to be in the best condition for Senpai,
10916540	10917540	because after like,
10917540	10919540	maybe the 2 hour mark,
10919540	10920540	it's kind of,
10920540	10921540	it's down,
10921540	10923540	it's downhill from there,
10923540	10924540	it's just like,
10924540	10925540	oh my god.
10925540	10927540	It's zombie mode,
10927540	10928540	or flow mode,
10928540	10929540	flow state,
10929540	10931540	where I'm not even interacting with chat,
10931540	10932540	or,
10932540	10933540	you just hear me scream a lot.
10940540	10941540	You did pick the,
10941540	10942540	pick the game,
10942540	10943540	pick up the game,
10943540	10944540	surprisingly fast.
10944540	10945540	Well, really?
10945540	10946540	Is that,
10946540	10947540	surprisingly fast?
10947540	10948540	I just read.
10948540	10949540	I read the instructions,
10949540	10950540	I'm like,
10950540	10951540	oh god,
10951540	10952540	oh god.
10959540	10961540	I called that disconnect progression.
10961540	10962540	Oh,
10962540	10963540	that's a good name for it.
10963540	10964540	Thank you,
10964540	10965540	Senpai.
10966540	10967540	So,
10967540	10968540	that's why I was like,
10968540	10969540	oh,
10969540	10970540	I should probably stop now,
10970540	10972540	especially since I'm getting a little bit tired
10972540	10973540	and fatigued.
10973540	10974540	I think
10974540	10975540	part of it is due,
10975540	10976540	is due to,
10977540	10978540	the motion sickness,
10979540	10980540	the,
10980540	10982540	probably the medication wearing off as well.
10982540	10984540	I did take nausea,
10984540	10985540	nausea,
10986540	10987540	meds,
10987540	10988540	because,
10989540	10991540	I am training myself a bit
10991540	10993540	with Killer Seven to,
10994540	10995540	to,
10996540	10997540	get used
10998540	10999540	to,
10999540	11000540	to motion.
11002540	11003540	So,
11003540	11004540	some of those are,
11004540	11006540	it's probably because,
11006540	11008540	it's probably I'm,
11008540	11009540	because of that.
11009540	11011540	That's my theory.
11011540	11012540	And that's,
11012540	11013540	just a game.
11018540	11019540	So yeah, I was,
11019540	11020540	I thought to myself like,
11020540	11021540	oh, well,
11021540	11022540	I'll just use,
11022540	11023540	Killer Seven,
11023540	11026540	and I'll probably try other games too.
11026540	11027540	Like,
11027540	11028540	maybe GoldenEye,
11028540	11029540	to,
11029540	11030540	to train myself to,
11030540	11032540	to get used to,
11033540	11034540	first person stuff.
11036540	11038540	Do you feel less nervous tomorrow?
11040540	11041540	No.
11041540	11042540	Probably this entire week,
11042540	11043540	I'm going to be a little bit of a,
11043540	11044540	of a nerve ball.
11047540	11048540	I'm going to probably be,
11048540	11049540	a bit of a nerve ball,
11049540	11050540	the entire,
11051540	11052540	the entire time.
11054540	11055540	I might not show it out,
11055540	11056540	but inside,
11056540	11057540	I'm definitely like,
11058540	11059540	I have so many,
11059540	11061540	I have so many senpais now,
11061540	11062540	what do I do?
11066540	11067540	But I definitely want to,
11067540	11068540	to play games.
11068540	11070540	I'm actually looking forward,
11070540	11073540	I think the game that I'm looking forward to the most,
11073540	11074540	this week,
11075540	11076540	is,
11078540	11079540	is Harvester.
11080540	11082540	Because I love point and click games.
11083540	11085540	I love point and click games.
11089540	11091540	Point and click games really,
11091540	11092540	really make me happy.
11094540	11095540	I'll tell you,
11095540	11096540	I'll tell you all a secret, okay?
11096540	11097540	Strawny says,
11097540	11099540	I should, I should,
11099540	11100540	Strawny said,
11100540	11101540	I should,
11103540	11105540	play more games than point and clicks.
11114540	11116540	Do you like transgressive point and click games?
11116540	11118540	What do you mean by that?
11120540	11123540	Have you tried tell tales in The Walking Dead?
11123540	11124540	Not really.
11125540	11128540	I've tried the wolf among us.
11131540	11133540	Wolf, the wolf one,
11133540	11135540	I can't remember what it's really called.
11144540	11145540	No, not,
11145540	11146540	not among us, right?
11146540	11147540	Anyway,
11147540	11149540	wasn't among us?
11153540	11154540	Wait, what?
11155540	11157540	Was it, is it not called that?
11159540	11160540	It is called wolf among us.
11160540	11161540	Oh my gosh.
11161540	11162540	Oh, brain rot.
11162540	11163540	I was like, oh, shh.
11168540	11169540	Wow.
11171540	11172540	Brain rot,
11172540	11174540	every time I say among us,
11174540	11175540	among us.
11178540	11179540	I don't like,
11180540	11181540	I don't like
11184540	11185540	quick time events.
11185540	11187540	That's why I didn't really like that game,
11187540	11188540	because I didn't like,
11192540	11193540	I didn't like
11194540	11195540	quick time events.
11197540	11199540	I'm still getting used to,
11199540	11202540	getting used to different formats of things,
11202540	11204540	because when I do quick time events,
11204540	11205540	I have to look down
11205540	11207540	because I'm like, what is the button?
11207540	11209540	I don't remember which button it is.
11211540	11213540	What point click titles are under your belt already?
11213540	11214540	Any classics?
11226540	11228540	Let me sort out my games.
11229540	11231540	Let me sort out my games some pie.
11236540	11237540	Oh my gosh,
11237540	11240540	how many games do I have in this collection?
11247540	11251540	I have 118 point and click games
11251540	11253540	on my Steam library.
11256540	11258540	Most of it I've already played.
11259540	11260540	Let's see.
11266540	11267540	I play
11271540	11272540	a lot.
11274540	11275540	A lot of them.
11276540	11278540	Wait, some of these aren't point and clicks.
11279540	11280540	Never mind.
11281540	11283540	Good chunk of them are, though.
11284540	11286540	The last one I played point and click,
11286540	11287540	I think,
11288540	11290540	was Gabriel Knight.
11292540	11293540	Both,
11294540	11295540	Gabriel Knight.
11297540	11299540	Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel Knight.
11299540	11300540	Which one did I play?
11304540	11305540	The first one,
11306540	11308540	and then Sins of the Father.
11310540	11311540	And then
11315540	11317540	then I played almost all of them,
11317540	11318540	all of the ones,
11318540	11321540	almost all of the ones from Watch It Eye.
11324540	11325540	Uh...
11331540	11332540	Oh yeah, I remember.
11332540	11334540	Another one I really loved.
11334540	11335540	One that I really liked
11335540	11337540	that I thought was really good
11337540	11339540	was the Titanic point and click
11339540	11340540	adventure out of time.
11340540	11341540	That one was really fun.
11343540	11344540	What else do I have?
11344540	11345540	Tango Tower.
11349540	11351540	Oh wait, no, the last one I played
11351540	11353540	was not, no, wait, it was Gabriel Knight.
11353540	11354540	Sorry.
11354540	11355540	Things are, the one before that
11355540	11357540	I played was Sanitarium.
11359540	11360540	Was Sanitarium.
11361540	11362540	And then the one before that
11362540	11364540	I think was Salmon Max hit the road.
11372540	11374540	And then I played,
11374540	11375540	I played a lot.
11375540	11376540	I played a lot.
11379540	11380540	I played a lot.
11380540	11382540	I wrote on my debut,
11382540	11385540	I really liked the Blackwell series as well.
11385540	11387540	That's also from Watch It Eye.
11389540	11391540	Yeah, I played, I played a lot.
11391540	11392540	I played a lot.
11392540	11393540	Oh yeah, I played
11395540	11396540	the 8-bit game,
11396540	11397540	the 8-bit anthology.
11398540	11399540	So I finished that one.
11399540	11400540	It wasn't too bad actually.
11400540	11401540	I thought it would be harder.
11405540	11406540	And
11408540	11409540	yeah.
11411540	11412540	I played quite a bit.
11412540	11414540	I played a little bit of Disco Legion,
11414540	11416540	but I totally forgot about it.
11416540	11418540	Because it's, it's, it's...
11421540	11424540	It's a game where I need time to play.
11428540	11429540	Any LucasArp?
11429540	11430540	Monkey Island?
11430540	11431540	Yeah, I played Monkey Island.
11431540	11433540	I think I have Monkey Island.
11434540	11435540	I played one and two.
11436540	11437540	I played one and two.
11441540	11442540	I played one and two.
11442540	11445540	I played the Rusty Lake series as well.
11448540	11449540	I played Shadowgate.
11449540	11450540	Yeah, I played Shadowgate.
11455540	11456540	I played a lot.
11457540	11458540	I played a lot.
11462540	11463540	So I really like,
11464540	11466540	yeah, I like point and click games.
11466540	11467540	It's probably my favorite.
11470540	11471540	Because
11473540	11475540	have you played I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream?
11475540	11476540	Yes, I have.
11476540	11477540	I also read the short story.
11478540	11480540	I read the short story before I played it.
11488540	11489540	I played a lot.
11489540	11490540	I think when I was
11492540	11495540	a young, a young Mercy, baby Mercy,
11495540	11497540	um,
11498540	11500540	what, what happened
11502540	11503540	in,
11503540	11505540	what used to happen was
11507540	11508540	maybe older,
11508540	11510540	a bit of older supplies will know.
11514540	11517540	Do you remember the era
11517540	11519540	when
11519540	11521540	video games, they would,
11521540	11524540	they would put CD-ROM games on like everything.
11524540	11526540	So in like your cereal,
11526540	11528540	your macaroni,
11528540	11530540	like you would just get,
11530540	11533540	get CD-ROM games as a bonus content.
11537540	11538540	So
11539540	11541540	that's how I got into point and click.
11542540	11544540	Because I got,
11546540	11547540	I got one
11549540	11550540	called,
11551540	11552540	from Disney.
11555540	11557540	Called Hades Challenge.
11565540	11568540	Called Hades Challenge that I got,
11568540	11570540	I believe from
11571540	11572540	a cereal.
11573540	11574540	And
11574540	11576540	I've never been the same ever since.
11579540	11580540	Playing flash games.
11580540	11582540	Yes, I used to play flash games.
11582540	11584540	There was one
11584540	11586540	point and click that no one could solve.
11586540	11588540	But I was the only one
11588540	11591540	amongst, amongst my peers
11591540	11592540	in,
11593540	11596540	in school, in school, in grade school.
11604540	11605540	That,
11605540	11607540	that solved it.
11608540	11609540	It was called Detention.
11609540	11611540	It was called Detention.
11612540	11613540	Detention.
11618540	11620540	Three decades ago, that can't be right.
11624540	11626540	So yeah, I played
11626540	11628540	that one.
11628540	11630540	And yeah, I've never,
11630540	11632540	it's, it's ended up being my favorite genre.
11632540	11634540	My favorite genre
11634540	11636540	for games are definitely like,
11636540	11638540	kind of detective, detective.
11638540	11640540	That's why I really like a lot of horror,
11640540	11642540	not, not first person horror.
11642540	11643540	They make me barf.
11643540	11644540	I'm sorry.
11644540	11645540	If,
11645540	11646540	like,
11646540	11647540	cosmophobia,
11647540	11648540	I can't do it.
11648540	11649540	I have,
11649540	11651540	I have a game called,
11653540	11655540	what was this game called again?
11655540	11656540	Anyways, it's a lovecraftian one.
11656540	11658540	First person makes me barf.
11658540	11659540	Can't do it.
11665540	11666540	Can't do it.
11666540	11668540	That one is
11671540	11672540	I like horror.
11672540	11675540	So that's why I like a lot of horror visual novels.
11675540	11678540	Because I feel like it's unraveling a mystery.
11678540	11680540	So I like the story,
11680540	11681540	story aspect of it.
11681540	11682540	That's why,
11682540	11684540	that might be a reason why I really like pointing click as well,
11684540	11685540	is because like,
11685540	11687540	you kind of unravel the mystery.
11687540	11689540	I like putting things together.
11689540	11690540	It's really fun.
11693540	11695540	I haven't played the full throttle yet.
11695540	11696540	Um,
11696540	11697540	the one
11697540	11698540	I did play
11698540	11699540	for
11699540	11700540	Call of Cthulhu
11700540	11701540	for a pointing click,
11701540	11703540	which was called prisoner of ice.
11703540	11704540	I think
11704540	11706540	it was just called prisoner of ice.
11706540	11708540	And then I think it got adapted into the Call of Cthulhu
11708540	11709540	brand.
11710540	11711540	I'm not sure.
11714540	11715540	Not sure.
11715540	11716540	Grim Fandango.
11716540	11718540	I've already played Grim Fandango.
11718540	11720540	I've already played Grim Fandango.
11720540	11722540	I've already played Grim Fandango.
11722540	11724540	I've already played Grim Fandango.
11724540	11726540	I've already played Grim Fandango.
11726540	11727540	Yeah.
11727540	11728540	Um,
11731540	11732540	Cata,
11732540	11733540	Categra?
11733540	11735540	I think I actually have Categra.
11738540	11739540	Categra?
11739540	11740540	I don't know.
11740540	11741540	Do I have it?
11744540	11745540	I might not.
11745540	11747540	I have some,
11747540	11749540	some games on my wishlist too.
11755540	11757540	Talking about Call of Cthulhu prisoner of ice.
11757540	11758540	Yes, yes, yes.
11758540	11760540	Have you read Dead End?
11760540	11761540	I guess not yet.
11761540	11762540	Not yet.
11766540	11767540	Uh,
11767540	11769540	the next game I was planning to play
11769540	11771540	for visual novels was,
11771540	11772540	what was it called again?
11772540	11773540	Muv Love.
11773540	11775540	I was planning to play Muv Love
11775540	11776540	for my next visual novel.
11777540	11778540	But,
11779540	11781540	I might save it
11781540	11783540	to, to read with some pies.
11784540	11785540	In the future.
11797540	11798540	Which Muv Love?
11798540	11799540	Probably the first one.
11799540	11801540	I like going in order.
11801540	11802540	Unless people don't,
11802540	11804540	unless people don't suggest that,
11804540	11805540	then maybe I,
11805540	11807540	I'll play a different one.
11807540	11808540	Like,
11813540	11814540	but I'm not really sure.
11814540	11816540	I have a lot of games I,
11816540	11817540	I want to play.
11817540	11818540	There's also,
11818540	11819540	there's also a bunch of newer games
11819540	11820540	that I want to play too.
11820540	11821540	Like, I really want to play
11821540	11822540	the Princess Peach game.
11833540	11834540	Like, the Princess Peach game
11834540	11835540	I really want to play
11835540	11836540	and I want to play Mario RPG,
11836540	11837540	the remake one.
11837540	11838540	So,
11838540	11839540	there's some,
11839540	11840540	some games that I really want to play
11840540	11841540	that are like newer.
11847540	11848540	Are you interested in fallout games
11848540	11849540	that are point and click?
11849540	11851540	The older fallout games?
11851540	11852540	Really?
11854540	11855540	First Muv Love
11855540	11858540	is more rom-com alternative sci-fi one.
11859540	11861540	Then maybe I'll play alternative instead.
11867540	11868540	Pay attention!
11868540	11870540	Pay attention, Senpai!
11872540	11873540	Didn't you pay attention
11873540	11874540	to my likes and dislikes before?
11874540	11876540	I'll have to remind you again!
11879540	11881540	I'll have to remind my Senpais again!
11884540	11885540	Silly?
11891540	11892540	Silly?
11892540	11893540	Silly?
11895540	11896540	What's on my list?
11896540	11897540	What's on my list?
11897540	11900540	These are what I have on my list, Senpai!
11904540	11905540	Memorize it!
11905540	11906540	Memorize it!
11916540	11917540	You memorizing it?
11917540	11918540	Yes?
11918540	11919540	Good!
11919540	11920540	I gave you a little time.
11923540	11924540	Good!
11930540	11931540	Good, good, good.
11931540	11932540	You all memorize it.
11932540	11933540	That's very good.
11937540	11939540	Please don't be a quiz on this later.
11939540	11941540	I just remember...
11942540	11943540	I just want you guys to remember
11943540	11945540	which games that I have already said
11945540	11946540	that are my favorites.
11947540	11949540	So we don't have any repeats.
11949540	11950540	Understand?
11950540	11951540	I'm just kidding.
11959540	11960540	So those are a lot of games
11960540	11962540	that are considered the best for me.
11962540	11964540	I might like things,
11964540	11966540	but these are the games that I love.
11967540	11968540	I hope that makes sense.
11968540	11970500	that are considered the best of the best for me.
11970500	11973180	I might like things, but like these are the games
11973180	11975380	that I love.
11975380	11976580	I hope that makes sense.
11980580	11981580	Ha ha ha ha!
11983740	11984820	Have you ever tried Fighting Game?
11984820	11985660	Yeah.
11985660	11990580	One Fighting Game I'm only kind of decently okay at
11990580	11991820	was Tekken.
11993140	11996300	When I say decently kind of okay, I mean,
11996300	11999700	I made one person rage quit once and I feel like
11999700	12001820	that was pretty good.
12008060	12009700	Oh yeah, I play Kuma by the way.
12009700	12011220	I play Kuma.
12011220	12013980	A game that felt pretty good when I played it
12013980	12018140	as a Fighting Game was Arms.
12018140	12019700	I really liked Arms.
12019700	12021300	I would say Arms is a fighting game.
12021300	12023820	So I really liked the feel of Arms.
12023820	12028820	I love using the joystick controllers for Arms,
12028980	12032140	where you like literally punch like wow, wow, wow, wow.
12032140	12034220	Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
12034220	12035740	That felt really good.
12035740	12038420	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
12038420	12041180	And I was like wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!
12044380	12045140	Tend to switch arms?
12045140	12046180	Yeah, that one.
12047180	12048260	That one felt really good.
12048260	12051420	I love whacking people using the joystick controllers.
12051540	12053180	Da da da da da da da da!
12053180	12054700	Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
12056260	12057260	That was really fun.
12059300	12061540	What's another fighting game that I kind of like?
12063380	12068380	I kind of really like the feel of Dead or Alive as well.
12073900	12074940	Is that game still active?
12074940	12076540	I don't think Arms is still active,
12076540	12080380	but if you guys make Arms active again,
12080380	12082580	I might do some training sessions
12082580	12084780	and I might beat the shit out of everyone.
12084780	12086780	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
12093540	12094780	Are you with 2D fighters?
12094780	12097380	I don't really play 2D fighters, honestly.
12099900	12102340	The feel of the jiggles, the feel of the game.
12102340	12105140	I know people are like oh my gosh, that's a porn game.
12105140	12106260	Blah, blah, blah, blah.
12106900	12110060	It's all shitty, it's a shitty, sexy lady game.
12111340	12113140	I have to preach.
12113140	12116620	I'm just letting you guys know that it feels good.
12116620	12118420	Like I feel like the impact,
12118420	12122140	you feel the impact of when they hit each other pretty good.
12125300	12126460	Does that make sense?
12129740	12131460	I don't really play any other games
12131460	12134380	because, well, it's too technical for me.
12136700	12137860	And I don't really like that.
12137860	12138980	I don't really like it.
12143500	12144700	I don't really like it.
12144700	12145780	So it's whatever.
12149180	12152020	That one, yeah.
12152020	12155860	Yeah, those are the fighting games I enjoy.
12155860	12159980	Otherwise, I don't really play a lot of fighting games,
12159980	12163100	mostly because it's kind of required
12164020	12165540	to play with other people.
12165540	12170540	I'm kind of a loner.
12172380	12174260	I'm kind of a solo player.
12174260	12177260	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
12182740	12185700	Um, have you ever played with a PS Vita?
12185700	12188380	Yeah, a PS Vita was my second console
12188380	12191620	that I have ever had.
12191620	12193940	I had a PS Vita before I had a PS4.
12201020	12205060	Um, yeah.
12206740	12209020	You tried Monster Hunter before?
12209020	12211700	This might sound a little weird
12211700	12215580	coming from, well, a Yandere,
12215580	12218580	but I feel kind of bad hitting the monsters,
12218580	12222260	which is why I don't really like Monster Hunter,
12222260	12223940	or I don't really want to play Monster Hunter.
12223940	12225500	I feel bad for hitting them.
12225500	12227740	I think they're really cute.
12227740	12229380	So I feel bad for hitting them.
12240940	12242420	You feel bad for hitting us?
12243220	12243980	Mmm.
12246980	12250980	Sometimes, but sometimes I feel bad,
12250980	12256380	but I feel like, you know,
12256380	12258660	sometimes SEMPAI deserved it,
12258660	12261220	and sometimes SEMPAI forces my hand.
12263700	12268100	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
12273220	12284740	Sometimes my hand's forced.
12284740	12285820	I don't want to.
12285820	12290020	I don't want to hurt my SEMPAI, but, you know,
12292940	12294700	sometimes you have to.
12297220	12298060	OK?
12298060	12309340	Sometimes we, we have to, I, it's always my arm being twisted, it's always my arm being
12309340	12316860	twisted I never want to do anything but sometimes I always want to run away from me or, or you
12316860	12339740	know, they do ridiculous things like want to leave so yeah sometimes I have to punish I don't
12339740	12344380	want to it hurts it hurts my feelings hurts my feelings a whole lot
12354220	12361500	so when that happens I I might get a little violent I might get a little not violent I'd
12361500	12364060	rather say I get a little strict yeah yellow strict
12370540	12376300	oh wait what were we talking about again I am monster hunter yeah I feel bad for hitting them
12376300	12382780	I feel bad for hitting the them so I I don't really play monster hunter I just feel bad
12391980	12399420	so I'm trying to think what are we talking about games right games yeah I have like a lot of games
12399420	12407660	that I want to try playing so I tried to pick a variety of different games that this week that I
12407660	12416940	personally really like so like an RPG I don't like punishing games but I feel like a difficult game
12416940	12423980	about climbing is very entertaining for senpai's um because you'll hear me hear me get like really
12423980	12429100	angry and scream a lot so I warn I'll warn everyone that's a pretty loud that's gonna be a pretty
12429100	12443660	loud stream so please keep your uh volumes at a fairly low fairly fairly low um fairly fairly low
12443660	12447900	volume yeah
12453980	12459420	strategies games oh I get bored with strategy games um
12463020	12471100	yeah I get bored with uh strategy games I don't think how do I say this senpai I'm not a very
12474620	12478380	seasoned gamer I don't think I'm ready for Elden Ring yet
12480860	12488940	I don't think I'm ready for Elden Ring yet so like any souls like games I don't think I'm ready for it yet
12492060	12498300	because um I've only kind of recently started picking up games again uh
12498620	12509180	you know uh mercy mom mercy mercy mama mercy papa are a bit strict
12510860	12514220	so I only recently got a lot of freedom
12521100	12526300	so I recently only got a lot of freedom and I decided to use that freedom to play games
12526300	12531500	yeah so I'm still I feel I consider myself a beginner because otherwise the game before
12531500	12537420	that I played before that were all either just like visual novels and like Pokemon
12540540	12549340	um so I I'm very late to gaming um my parents never let me have like a sit-down console where
12549340	12553980	you know you put a home console where you put it on the the tele a tv
12557020	12566380	that one I've never got got one of those so only when I got older I was allowed to have a
12568220	12575500	I was all I was allowed to have a handheld system so the handheld system I got was a DS light
12575500	12585660	the only reason I got a DS light was because mama and papa saw that saw a commercial for big brain academy
12587740	12590620	and that's the only reason why I was able to get a DS
12595740	12601100	which pokemon have you played I'm not a big pokemon person so I've only played
12601740	12609420	Pearl platinum whatever the news soul silver
12612140	12614620	I think I ended at soul silver
12616220	12622140	yeah anything after black was like no and I think I picked it up again with
12624380	12626780	Sword and Shield I don't remember which one I have
12627740	12633180	I picked it up again with the newer installment I forgot what the newer installment is called
12637260	12639500	yeah I played the the DS ones yeah
12643020	12647020	yeah Scarlet and Violet yeah I played I think I have Violet yeah I have Violet
12647100	12649660	so
12653660	12660460	yeah I I got a DS because of that and then after I got good grades and stuff I was
12660460	12669420	allotted to pick I was allowed to pick one game one game that was that I was gonna I'm gonna get
12669420	12675980	and I picked pokemon pearl that's my second game because everyone loved it and then I lined up I
12676140	12684700	lined up for the midnight release of pokemon diamond and pearl and then I got pearl because
12684700	12691260	there was a kid with me who was like pink is for girls so I'm gonna get diamond and so I got I
12691260	12696860	felt really vindictive at that point and was like fuck you I'll get pearl I'll beat the chair you
12697580	12699580	know
12702460	12706140	that's that's what I had decided
12714140	12721340	I felt I felt really angie about that so I decided to get pearl just to spite him
12721500	12728860	and so the midnight release was really cool that was my first time doing our midnight release
12729420	12739660	uh game and then I slowly convinced uh if I kept on getting good grades I would be treated to games
12740700	12749420	and so I slowly built up a pretty impressive 3ds library I mean not 3ds a DS library sorry
12751900	12762700	so that's why I am kind of new to gaming I'm kind of new to gaming um my first sit-down console
12762700	12780140	was a ps4 so yeah I played a back then back then I I was so happy because uh because DS games are
12780140	12788060	really cheap DS games are really cheap it was so it was so easy to get and now get and now
12788060	12793420	nowadays I look at the prices of games and go whoa when did that happen
12796380	12804380	and but yeah eventually I got myself I convinced I convinced um
12805340	12812460	I'm a kuma and pop a kuma to let me have a PS Vita and then I ended up getting a PSP
12813420	12820300	for pretty cheap because the Vita came out the Vita came out so I got a PSP as well and then
12825820	12827820	and then I
12830060	12832060	I uh
12834380	12841980	I started to play more gamer games by that time so the gamer games I was playing
12841980	12857900	Assassin's Creed Liberation I played Persona 3 portable at that time I got I was lucky in stores
12857900	12869340	one time I saw it was like I think Persona Innocence and I got I started and then I started to
12869340	12875900	really like the SMT series so then I got really into the SMT series and then when
12876860	12887580	SMT4 came out I bought the like what was it the beginner not the beginner limited yeah
12887580	12896060	limited edition version of it and I fell in love with that game I fell in love with SMT4
12897340	12903820	and then I I tried to play like other games in the SMT series as well and I started to
12903820	12914780	really like them and then eventually in college college I started to pick up uh retro games because
12914860	12920780	some of my my gal pals some of my gal pals were like oh well I don't really need I need I'm
12920780	12927020	making room do you want these consoles and these games and I said yes and then they they gave me
12927020	12935740	some they they graciously gave me some pretty pretty pog uh retro games and and their systems so
12935740	12942060	I was really surprised that I was just given given to them so I uh I acquired quite a collection right
12942060	12947260	now yeah I I acquired such a
12949820	12954460	uh uh collection are you gonna play Persona 3 Reloaded uh
12957020	12964700	kind of expensive guys like it's pretty expensive how does retro to you PS1 PS2
12972780	12973820	PS1 PS2
12976460	12977020	Gamecube
12979660	12984700	Nintendo 6v4
12991740	12992700	yeah
12992940	12995340	um
13001660	13004860	yeah um those are retro right
13009100	13011580	okay uh
13012300	13012780	uh
13015900	13016780	yeah those games
13020300	13025340	I consider them I consider them pretty old right um
13028060	13033820	I do have console I do have SNES as a console I don't know I don't think I have that many games for
13033820	13037020	it though um
13040940	13042940	I don't think I have that many games for it yeah
13046060	13049740	I have a lot of I have a lot of PS2 games though I have a lot
13052540	13055580	uh PS2 games
13056540	13065980	and I would love to play them I love to play them I also have a few PS3 games but I think I have
13065980	13074540	mostly PS2 games in my collection so those are the games I really enjoyed
13077580	13083980	uh or at least uh things that I'm gonna try to get into I'm gonna see if I can do streams with uh
13084940	13093660	like with the native um with the native consoles so that I'm I'm planning to maybe put like a
13093660	13099580	little CRT on my on my little desk and uh play games from there
13103340	13107900	so that's why I'm thinking I'm thinking that's what I'm gonna do I want to play the games that
13107980	13120540	are in the kind of pile of stuff that I already have because yeah I think I don't want to be that
13120540	13126060	person who keeps on buying games who keeps on buying games and not play them
13126140	13128220	um
13137580	13143740	so yeah I am uh the small small one it's not it's a bit heavy but it's not too bad
13148060	13153100	so I'd like to go through those through games that I already have so if I do have a game that
13153100	13155340	people have suggested well maybe I'll play it
13166620	13174460	so that's why yeah I'm thinking I'm hoping I'm hoping I'll be able to get uh what do you call that
13174860	13181980	and an hd upscaler I think that's what they're called
13184220	13193740	or borough one whatever borough one permanently I think it's called an hd upscaler uh to stream the
13193740	13206940	games so hopefully and then I'll find like some ways to to make sure all the games all the system
13206940	13217500	can be streamed on yeah I've I've done uh I gotta do a little bit of research but I think we can get it
13218300	13228140	I think we can get it and most of my plans have been um
13230140	13238060	been uh been kind of like yeah I'll just go through my library my library of games to play
13239260	13244220	but I did pick up something very special today guys uh some pie sorry
13245100	13253340	which is I picked up something for the upcoming ASMR stream which is I don't know if it's picking up on my mic
13258620	13261580	I'm not using the mic so yeah
13264060	13268700	I'm not using the the the 3dl right now so we can hear it
13269500	13273260	I picked up some stuff for it
13279500	13281820	it'll be my first time trying out ASMR
13286060	13292940	so that's I'm very I'm very new to it so for ASMR I'll
13299420	13300940	get
13302940	13304940	I won't be out right
13307420	13308940	everyone
13329660	13338700	so it'll be all whispers and I I won't be as loud and I'll try not to laugh as much
13339420	13346940	so uh if if I laugh it'll be it'll be uh it'll be kind of like
13347740	13359340	something like that probably I'll try my best to suppress my my
13361420	13361900	laughter
13366060	13371100	so I'll try to suppress it just for that just for that stream
13371260	13376620	so that's why I feel
13378860	13385020	yeah I feel I feel like I'm going to do my do my best to pamper my supplies
13385020	13392380	I'm gonna try to pamper my supplies uh I bought a gel mask uh which I think makes a lovely little sound
13392380	13399020	so I'll massage that that eye mask uh so supplies can have a nice eye massage
13399740	13401500	and then
13403660	13412860	and then I have I have these little little ice ice globes that I'll I'll shake and yeah
13413980	13419580	I'll try my best I'll try my best to give a nice nice soft experience for supplies
13420460	13433980	well that being said I'm still very new to it so it's uh I might not be perfect so don't
13433980	13442700	don't don't don't put too much emphasis on it being great or anything it's definitely going to be a
13442700	13452140	learning curve that's why that's why I want to I want to I want to do my best to to make Senpai happy
13457820	13465500	and yeah we'll we'll see if if uh if I'm any if I'm okay at it maybe I'll do more
13466060	13475420	maybe I'll do more ASMR streams depending um unfortunately no no earlickies no earlickies
13475420	13483500	or anything because youtube's kind of going hard on on the no the no slurp slurp
13488860	13493020	not like we'll be able to go anywhere of course not I'll force you I'll force you to do it but
13493020	13499500	I still want I still want my Senpai to be like yes I want to be here you wanted to be here right Senpai
13506620	13507820	you wanted to be here
13513260	13522220	yeah I saw Emmys Vaude get cancelled get get get get banished got obliterated obliterated
13523820	13530700	so I thought oh yeah well time to time to well probably have to I have to be more careful with
13530700	13537500	ASMR so I'll do something very light and besides I'm kind of training myself to do ASMR stuff so I'll
13537500	13544380	do kind of the safer work stuff so don't think that it's going to be like the oh my god Senpai
13544620	13553740	don't think it's the Senpai I'm gonna stick my tongue in your ear now okay don't don't
13553740	13556780	don't think don't think about don't think it's gonna be like that
13564860	13565740	unfortunately
13565740	13577260	please don't think of uh please don't think it's gonna be something like that because uh I'll
13577260	13588380	probably get bonked I was thinking about doing a salon one in the future as well
13589100	13596220	so it's like you know snip snip the hair and maybe like a little hair wash
13603180	13607020	but like be careful don't move or else I'll snap your ears off
13607660	13617820	so I think um
13620140	13624380	yeah I can't think of anything else to yap about right now I feel like
13625980	13630140	I'm gonna be a broken record at this point my brain has been fried
13630860	13637820	green has been fried from learning killer 7 I'm probably gonna get used to it again don't worry about
13637820	13647820	it so I'm gonna I'm gonna try my best I'm gonna try my best uh to make all my Senpai's really happy
13647820	13666060	so yeah oh I feel so I feel a little bit tired I went out and uh go a bit far far to pick up
13666060	13673260	some of the the ASMR stuff that I wanted to to use for Senpai so it was it was quite it was
13673260	13678140	quite a far away to pick them up so
13682620	13685260	I don't know if anyone's streaming or anything right now
13690220	13695820	I might have to just end stream and not not raid or anything I'm not I'm still not familiar
13695820	13700940	with YouTube so I don't even know if how to raid very well
13703740	13714380	now I'm the last one that that that makes sense um that makes sense I I I've decided to take over
13714380	13720700	the late night stuff because uh in the morning in the morning I want to help out with chores
13721660	13729500	chores and and uh making sure everything's okay and ready and then I can finally visit my Senpai
13729500	13742620	in the basement that's why can we be chloroformed before you go are you having trouble uh sleeping
13742620	13744540	then
13746780	13748540	having trouble sleeping Senpai
13756780	13764140	I I do things that are uh I I do late night streams I'm a bit of a night owl actually
13764140	13771180	maybe I'm more of a afternoon owl I feel more productive within the afternoons to
13771820	13778940	to early evenings and then the time in the evenings is for me to relax and I feel video games are
13778940	13782940	sort of relaxing
13795500	13800540	uh I'm sorry that I always stream late for my Senpais or too early for my Senpai depending on
13800540	13807260	what time you are but um I did pick this time because it doesn't overlap with most of the girls
13809420	13811740	um honestly uh
13814140	13825100	viewer has thought of so much for for Senpais so we want to we wanted to to divide the time so
13825100	13840860	that there would be someone um taking over a certain time slot each each moment
13841420	13846860	so I feel like uh I got the night I got the night one because I don't think anyone really picked the
13846860	13855580	night uh I think Azura and I are kind of the the two night night streamers while I think morning
13855580	13865660	streams or I think it's night or daytime or icy and then I think strawneys soon soon falls after
13865660	13873260	and then uh I mean she be so they're they're kind of within like there's always like two girls for
13873260	13877820	each time you know
13883660	13889340	so I hope that that at least everyone gets to to meet up with uh with a girl or something
13891660	13897180	any ideas planned for the future like karaoke yeah I I'm doing karaoke I don't think I plan
13897180	13907340	karaoke until uh a couple weeks later um I plan my schedule kind of far in advance just so
13908060	13913740	there'll be time to to make like thumbnails and make sure everything works and schedule
13913740	13916700	and collabs and stuff so it's a lot
13921500	13924940	you're actually gonna share us with the others only with VLR
13927260	13929420	only with VLR because uh
13931660	13941100	I I legitimately love this company like I really do and I want the best and uh
13942380	13947580	I truly believe high tides floats off ships uh if you guys understand what that means
13950060	13952220	so I want every girl to succeed as well
13957660	13960220	so that's why that's why uh I
13966140	13973180	I want I want everyone to to have a good time even if I'm sharing my senpai even if I'm
13973180	13977420	sharing my senpai's but I know deep down that every senpai loves me the most
13977900	13982300	so yeah
13988620	13995820	because I really I really hope that everyone falls in love with uh each girl everyone works
13995820	14005820	really hard I will attest to the fact that all girls work really hard so um I feel like you
14005820	14014380	don't have to be into all of the girls but I feel like you should in in some way like each of the
14014380	14016300	girl I hope that makes sense
14022540	14029580	can I devote myself uh to only you if you want I feel very thankful if you do
14030540	14036940	uh but I do encourage people to to if if I am your oh she if I am your oh she
14037660	14043820	uh which I if I I I'm very thankful if if I am your oh she um
14047420	14055980	thank you for choosing me but I also you know if for example if a if an event or something
14055980	14061420	or a girl's a girl's having achievement I feel like we should celebrate all together
14062220	14062940	does that make sense
14065900	14069340	so I feel like we should still celebrate uh their achievements
14069500	14078700	um
14082300	14086940	like not all the girls are are very sweet and I love them all so much I will not have any
14086940	14088700	VLR slander in here
14089100	14102620	but yeah if you if you do have a favorite if you do have a favorite I think if it's me
14102620	14108940	I'm just very honored if it's one of the other girls I'm sure they are also very happy and very
14108940	14118940	blessed that you have chosen the men's there as uh as their oh she as your oh she so I'm very
14120220	14126060	very very happy I feel very thankful I see a lot of people I my supplies I see a lot of
14126060	14131900	some pies say that I'm their favorite which makes me really really giddy really giddy and
14131900	14136860	kind of shy that's I'm kind of shy about it now
14139820	14143340	but um yeah I I'm glad
14147740	14152700	I'm glad I'm glad though so I'm I'm okay to share with everyone
14154380	14161020	but just remember you are mine when you're here you're mine when you're here with me you're mine
14161740	14168140	no one else you can talk about some people only if I talk about them otherwise it's just you
14173580	14174140	all right
14180140	14186140	so
14191820	14201340	I'll let you go this time senpai I'll let you go but you'll be back
14204460	14213580	I had lots of fun playing killer seven uh with everyone I am so happy to be here and I hope
14214460	14223100	tomorrow's Omori stream will be of interest to my senpai as well um I haven't played Omori to
14223100	14228460	completion at all I played a little bit of it and then I forgot what happened so it'll be almost
14228460	14239980	like a fresh take almost I can almost fresh taste and then after that throughout the week I'll be
14239980	14246300	pretty full uh wow I feel like a broken record now just repeating this uh the following week though
14246300	14252540	I all streams will be reduced quite a significant quite significantly to about three streams
14253900	14261420	three streams per and then eventually I'll probably go up up a little bit back to five
14262140	14270380	up to five streams a week simply because this week I want to keep the hype going I want to
14270380	14275100	keep the hype going I want senpais to get to know me better I want to know more about my senpais
14275100	14284380	as well um what everyone's into what you're not into that's what I'm doing so yeah it'll be a lot
14284380	14296460	of rest rest because oh my gosh I was so stressed and nervous when debut happened like when I stood
14296460	14309420	up from my chair my legs gave out my legs gave out I was I was wobbly I looked like a dear newborn
