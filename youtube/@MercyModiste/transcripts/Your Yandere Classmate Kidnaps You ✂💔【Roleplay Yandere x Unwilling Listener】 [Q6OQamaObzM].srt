1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,400
Hey, Senpai! Wait for me!

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:23,520
Sorry to bother you, but if you're not too busy, I was wondering if you'd be open to

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,720
studying for our finals together tonight. I heard you complaining with your friends

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,640
earlier about how scared you might fail. Maybe studying together might help you feel better about it?

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,040
Hmm? Senpai, are you unsure?

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,360
What if I straighten the teal a little?

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:01:03,280
We don't have to only study. We could do more if you want. We could have lots of fun together, don't you think?

8
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,280
Ah, I'm happy to hear that. I expected to see you at 7 today then. Make sure you wear something cute.

9
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,240
I know I will. See you later then!

10
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:36,320
Ah, Senpai, you made it! I'm so happy to see you. Do you like my skirt? I wore it just for you.

11
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,880
I saw you looking at some girls today wearing short skirts like this,

12
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,360
so I assume you like them. It's cute, isn't it?

13
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,320
You're so sweet. I usually wouldn't wear skirts while I'm lounging around the house,

14
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,440
but if it's for you, then I don't mind it. I would do a lot more for you.

15
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
If you just said the word.

16
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:16,880
Uh, I'm sorry. That was weird. Why don't you come in? I left you waiting long enough.

17
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,560
Right over here, I set up a little study station at the coffee table with snacks too, of course.

18
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:35,600
Really? That's your favorite brand of chips? What a coincidence. It's my favorite too.

19
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,440
I didn't know we had so much in common. Have a seat.

20
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:52,240
Ah, no, sorry. The other hand, this drink is yours. Sorry, I'm just really picky about,

21
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,160
um, how much ice is in my drink? Yeah, sorry.

22
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:10,000
So, do you have any specific classes you're struggling with the most?

23
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,520
I know for me, I'm really struggling in English class. That teacher's so damn picky about her

24
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:24,880
metaphors and sonnets or whatever. How's her name again? Ms. Simone? She's such a press.

25
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:35,680
You like her? Why? You think she's pretty? Of course you do.

26
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,360
Don't you think, um, your drink is getting warm? Maybe you should drink it while it's cold?

27
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,480
You don't care?

28
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:01,680
Right, yeah, sorry. There's no reason to care. It's just a me thing, I guess. I'm just picky like that.

29
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:13,920
We can continue studying, or you could tell me what it is about Ms. Simone that you like exactly.

30
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:23,200
I just want to know. Don't you talk about it with your bros all the time? Why not tell me?

31
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,880
I'm no different than them. Am I?

32
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:40,160
Right, yeah, I'm not. Just tell me what you like about her. Is it her boobs? They're pretty big,

33
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,360
right? Is that what you like? I bet she wears a push-up bra. Or maybe they're even fake.

34
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,160
Or do you like her nails? She always has them done so nicely. I wish I had time to do them like that.

35
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:01,200
I'm always so busy trying to keep up with you. I mean, trying to keep up with your grades. Yeah,

36
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,280
you're a lot smarter than me. I want to have good grades like you. So I spend a lot of time studying.

37
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:18,160
Yeah, that's why I invited you here today. Maybe some of your intelligence can rub off on me a little.

38
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,800
Anyway, why won't you just tell me? I want to know what makes her so special.

39
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,720
What makes every other girl so much better than me?

40
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:42,880
Hmm? Sampai? You look a little nervous and sweaty. Perhaps all that sweating has left you thirsty?

41
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,840
Why don't you just have a sip of your drink? I made it especially for you.

42
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,520
Come on. Just one sip. Do it.

43
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh, these? I'm just using them to cut a page of my notebook out.

44
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,880
No need to worry about it. I would never use these scissors on you.

45
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,080
Unless, of course, you were to disrespect me badly enough,

46
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,760
to the point where I felt like I needed to use them.

47
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,480
For example, not drinking the juice I worked so hard to make for you.

48
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,040
I'd squeeze those oranges with my bare hands, you know?

49
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:45,600
That's right. What a good boy. That's right. Drink up.

50
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,000
Drink all of it. I don't want to see a single drop left in that cup once you're done.

51
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,200
Good job. Thank you for that. I was getting worried for a second that you didn't actually

52
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,320
want to be here, and you only said yes to studying with me so you didn't hurt my feelings.

53
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:15,280
But it seems you actually do care about me. I'm glad. I care about you a lot, too, you know?

54
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,480
More than I let on. Why don't we start actually studying?

55
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,120
Let's start with English. Then we can move on to whatever subject you need help with.

56
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,720
Here's a question I would have trouble answering.

57
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,920
How does Hamlet's view of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern change?

58
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,360
I don't remember anything from Hamlet. Do you remember Senpai?

59
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:57,120
Senpai? Senpai? Can you hear me? I asked you a question, silly. Answer me.

60
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,880
Hey.

61
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,520
Finally. I thought you would never drink it. This whole thing would have been for nothing.

62
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,240
It took me a lot of courage to flirt with you in public like that,

63
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,600
but I didn't know any other way to lure you here. You were never receptive to my more wholesome

64
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:44,080
approaches, so I had to take things a step further. I was blushing so hard after I flirted

65
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:52,800
with you in front of the whole class today, Senpai. But it was all worth it,

66
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,600
because now I have you to myself, and I don't have to worry about anyone else taking you away from

67
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:11,600
me anymore. Let me closer. Since you're incapacitated, I can play with you all I want.

68
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,280
And you can do nothing about it.

69
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,600
You smell so sweet. Is this new shampoo? Smells different from the usual ones.

70
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:39,360
Hang out. Keeps still and quiet for me. My walls are thin, and I don't want the neighbors in

71
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:50,800
shooting on our special alone dime. Plus, you won't need to be awake much longer now.

72
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,200
Let's spend these final moments of peace together.

73
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:06,480
No silly. You're not gonna die. I'm just putting you to sleep for a little bit,

74
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:14,240
that's all, sweetie. I obviously need to train you into being the perfect boy for me.

75
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,880
We should start with those wandering eyes, don't you think?

76
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,880
I can't have you thinking it's acceptable to look or talk about other girls.

77
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,280
Sit still, alright? It will be over before you know it.
