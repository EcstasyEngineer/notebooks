1020420	1025420	Wait.
1025420	1030420	It's not ZK, is it?
1030420	1031420	It's not in ZK.
1031420	1033420	That would be so funny.
1033420	1037420	You see where the text says ISZK?
1037420	1043420	That would be so funny.
1043420	1045420	Oh, thank goodness it's not.
1045420	1049420	It would be so funny, but thank goodness it's not.
1049420	1054420	I know it's like, oh, we can totally,
1054420	1055420	we can totally brute force this,
1055420	1062420	but I want to solve it.

1141420	1156420	Oh, hey.
1156420	1162420	Oh, wait, it's different than a duplicate.
1162420	1168420	It's an evolved heaven smile with boosted explosive power.
1168420	1172420	You got to take it out before it gets too close.
1172420	1173420	They're crazy.
1173420	1174420	I'm telling you.
1174420	1178420	They'll be on top of you the moment you open the damn door.
1178420	1180420	Wait, can you say that again?
1180420	1193420	With this time, like more, more sash, sashual?
1193420	1194420	Okay.
1194420	1195420	This is where the queen is.
1195420	1198420	It's different than a duplicate.
1198420	1204420	An evolved heaven smile with boosted explosive power.
1204420	1209420	You got to take it out before it gets too close.
1209420	1210420	They're crazy.
1210420	1211420	I'm telling you.
1211420	1216420	They'll be on top of you the moment you open the door.
1216420	1237420	Well, shit, stairs.
1237420	1242420	Senpai, I might be fucking stupid.
1242420	1248420	I might be fucking stupid.
1248420	1249420	He said a door.
1249420	1260420	As soon as you get through the door, there was no fucking door.
1260420	1263420	I was like, what fucking door?
1263420	1265420	I'm going back.
1266420	1276420	I forgot how to heal.
1276420	1285420	Blood recovery.
1285420	1289420	Okay, there we go.
1289420	1298420	Okay.
1298420	1300420	Door equals stairs.
1300420	1315420	When he said door, I was like, oh, door, door, not stairs, corridor.
1315420	1325420	Fuck.
1325420	1330420	Fuck.
1330420	1332420	Am I kind of stupid?
1332420	1334420	Yes.
1334420	1344420	I didn't realize there was another corridor.
1344420	1345420	Which?
1345420	1347420	Which one?
1347420	1352420	There you are.
1352420	1357420	Okay, we're good.
1357420	1362420	I'm baffled by angles.
1362420	1366420	Can I go into Hyraman's room?
1366420	1368420	Oh.
1368420	1369420	Hi.
1369420	1373420	I'm on a go to the television now.
1373420	1385420	And please take the blood.
1385420	1388420	I can't save here, but I have some serum.
1388420	1393420	So I can...
1393420	1398420	I want to use my skills.
1398420	1400420	Let's do some...
1400420	1404420	I think I should put in criticals now.
1404420	1407420	Yeah, yeah, fuck you.
1407420	1409420	Yeah, I can do counter attacks.
1409420	1412420	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1412420	1423420	And speed or waver or power.
1423420	1438420	Waver is the wiggliness.
1438420	1451420	No, no, I don't have enough to have more power.
1451420	1457420	Maybe less wiggly, so we'll do the waver.
1457420	1460420	Okay.
1460420	1462420	Counter attack.
1462420	1469420	Okay, cool.
1469420	1479420	No, I did not.
1479420	1499420	Okay, we need any more blood now.
1499420	1501420	Ah, shit, which...
1501420	1503420	Which way did I go?
1503420	1508420	I forgot again.
1508420	1524420	Whoo!
1524420	1527420	The other way, wasn't it?
1527420	1538420	It was the other way.
1538420	1540420	Oh my gosh.
1540420	1545420	You scared me, bondage son.
1545420	1549420	Iwa, Iwazaru.
1549420	1552420	Master, we're in a tight spot.
1552420	1555420	Things are turning in a bad way.
1555420	1558420	An infamous criminal lies this way.
1558420	1561420	And he's protecting him.
1561420	1564420	Wicked bad partners, indeed, indeed.
1564420	1566420	Ah, yes.
1566420	1568420	Seek out the soul shells.
1568420	1573420	With soul shells.
1573420	1581420	He was sure to allow you in the name of Harman.
1581420	1587420	I didn't read that fast.
1587420	1590420	How fucked am I, Senpai?
1590420	1592420	Wait.
1592420	1596420	Let me go back.
1596420	1600420	Again.
1600420	1602420	And...
1602420	1610420	Iwazaru, I need to look at the instructions again.
1610420	1619420	Okay, master, blah blah blah.
1619420	1621420	Blood is scary stuff.
1621420	1623420	Without blood, there is no tomorrow.
1623420	1626420	Because how do I do the special again?
1626420	1629420	Personas can absorb the blood out of the enemy.
1629420	1634420	Access stabilizer to help handle multiple personalities.
1634420	1639420	Without blood, your very life is in danger.
1640420	1648420	Press start slash pause to check blood volume.
1648420	1652420	You must use blood wisely in the name of Harman.
1652420	1655420	Special aim plus Y button three times plus shoot.
1655420	1657420	Oh yeah!
1657420	1663420	Let me just refresh it again anyways.
1663420	1670420	Yeah, Dan's special attacks.
1670420	1673420	Okay, Helian Dan loves destruction.
1673420	1676420	He's bound to destroy the enemy's nest.
1676420	1678420	Press the Y button three times.
1678420	1680420	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1680420	1683420	Holding the gun with the R button.
1683420	1686420	Free test tubes will be equipped.
1686420	1688420	Use the A button to launch a demon shell.
1688420	1691420	Got it, got it, got it.
1691420	1694420	The red and yellow cores indicate the nest's weak points.
1694420	1696420	The name of Harman.
1696420	1705420	Oh, whoa, whoa.
1705420	1711420	I'm starting to remember slowly.
1711420	1715420	It was this holly.
1715420	1731420	Where's the yellow? Oh, there it is.
1731420	1734420	That was just me practicing, yeah.
1746420	1753420	Yeah.
1753420	1757420	Hello.
1757420	1759420	Gatekeeper.

1777420	1780420	Let me take those.
1780420	1782420	Yes, R received.
1782420	1791420	Go right inside.
1791420	1799420	Nah, I got it.
1799420	1806420	Lost fight.
1806420	1810420	Fuck it.
1810420	1817420	Wait, this music poppin'.
1829420	1840420	Yeah.
1840420	1847420	It's a pop.
1847420	1857420	Hello.
1857420	1859420	Hi, it was Aru.
1859420	1863420	Master, we're in a tight spot.
1863420	1866420	Ain't even funny how tight it is.
1866420	1870420	Once you open the door, there's no turning back, master.
1870420	1876420	Well, you can come back, but I mean that's the gravity of the situation.
1876420	1879420	Don't get me wrong.
1879420	1881420	Like a prelude to later battles, you know?
1881420	1884420	You must take it very seriously.
1884420	1905420	The name of Harmon.
1905420	1907420	Please help me.
1907420	1909420	That monster is quick as lightning.
1909420	1912420	I tried my best to run away,
1912420	1915420	but it caught up with me anyway.
1915420	1920420	Hey, kill it before it explodes.
1920420	1924420	No, I'm gonna die again today.
1924420	1932420	Somebody please help.
1932420	1936420	Should I?
1936420	1944420	Here we go.
1944420	1950420	Shit, shit. Wow, speed smile, huh?

2023420	2026420	Spot A.
2026420	2034420	Yes, we overwrite this file.
2034420	2037420	We need anything else?
2037420	2049420	Probably not, but I do have a save file just in case.
2049420	2055420	Let's get in.
2055420	2059420	Permission to help if you need it, only if I need it.
2059420	2063420	They got cameras.
2063420	2066420	Wait.
2066420	2074420	Am I gonna be okay?
2074420	2084420	Is Garcia gonna be okay?
2084420	2087420	Hello talk. Oh, there you are.
2087420	2089420	Don't be shy, Amir.
2089420	2092420	Who would have figured you'd be the only survivor?
2092420	2096420	Anyways, are you getting along with the chief?
2096420	2098420	Straight up, I was waiting for you the whole time.
2098420	2099420	Yeah, I know.
2099420	2102420	Don't be mad at me, man.
2102420	2105420	Don't glare at me like that.
2105420	2107420	The chief will wake up.
2107420	2110420	Really, I'm sorry.
2110420	2115420	The other chief must be rolling on the floor with laughter.

2145420	2150420	Wasn't that what I was doing?
2150420	2168420	Which side should I go first?

2208420	2212420	I'm the mother of this sacred place.
2212420	2216420	Our four children served their purpose.
2216420	2219420	They didn't die.
2219420	2223420	But our other nine children were killed by you.
2223420	2226420	What do you want from us?
2226420	2230420	Is it so bad that we have a purpose in life?
2230420	2233420	We are only serving our gods.
2233420	2237420	At Heaven's command, we will kill the unwanted.
2237420	2241420	Let's get rid of bad trees from their roots.
2241420	2245420	I hope you are not one of them.
2245420	2253420	A white child gets past your bedtime.

2699420	2715420	You're a bad player, senpai.
2715420	2728420	You're a good friend, but unfortunately, our interest is not mutual.
2728420	2736420	We both have become burdened with so much, and we don't have time for fun anymore.
2736420	2741420	There's always time for fun.
2741420	2757420	Let's dance.

4276740	4280100	I I have mixed feelings about it, you know
4282100	4287940	I have mixed feelings it got it gave me motion sickness, but I might be able to do it if there's no motion if I can do it again
4294180	4298180	Yeah, motion sickness strikes again, I think I liked four because it was on the ds
4299140	4301140	I

4343620	4345620	Not really
4345700	4354020	It doesn't matter what side I think a smaller screen is better though, but it's still kind of like oh, I'm still kind of dizzy, you know
4355780	4360660	Um, I don't like smt-3 that much because it's really punishing and hard
4362340	4367380	I'm a baby. I'm a baby when it comes to gaming. I want my games to be relaxing and easy
4367860	4369700	so that's why I play on easy mode and then
4370900	4375380	Don't tell other smt fans that I play on easy mode because it's uh

4920820	4922820	So everyone
4926020	4928580	Why do you always play ping pong? Why is it ping pong?
4929780	4932500	Settle in for some yapping. Yeah, we'll do a little bit of yapping
4933540	4944900	Before I continue well, I'll put this back back down by the sink and then if I need it again, I'll just pick it up again
4946260	4948100	so um
4948100	4953140	Yeah, my arm is very very very itchy. It looks so much better
4953700	4955700	Than it did like two days ago
4956340	4958580	Senpai like two days ago
4959220	4962420	It looks so bad. It looks so bad. I was like
4965140	4970580	Luckily all the games I was playing were like super easy or like could be played with one hand
4974340	4976340	Like you know
4977060	4984180	Any like walking stuff or like visual novels. It's just like dun dun dun dun dun. This one requires me to be actually you know
4985540	4987540	Good
4988740	4990740	So
4991300	4999700	Um, I was able to like rest my ice pack beside me and then kind of like just play with one hand
5004900	5006900	But um
5009220	5013780	Maybe you should change the schedule then uh, I still want to play killer seven
5014740	5020580	We'll just have to ice it so my arms when they flare up like they get so hot
5021300	5025780	That the ice melts that the ice melts and I can't even feel that the ice pack is cold
5025940	5029780	But if I put it like on my leg or something it's it's like oh, it's cold
5030740	5032500	But it feels like
5032500	5034340	It's not
5034340	5036340	When I put it on
5036340	5038340	It doesn't even feel cold
5038500	5040500	Uh
5042020	5047460	Fortunately killer seven isn't very intense. Yeah, it's not intense, but I it still requires two hands
5056100	5062900	But um, yeah, the doctor was checking the rest of my body to see if uh
5063220	5064340	Uh
5064340	5070900	If she could see if there were any anywhere else that it happened and she's like, oh, yeah, you got some on your legs
5071620	5072980	and
5072980	5076740	Uh, as I was at the doctor, I was like rashing up on the other side
5078260	5080260	On the other arm. I was like, ah
5081300	5087380	You know, I have a fever call. Hi. That's the first thing I checked. The first thing I checked was okay now. It's cold. Um
5088180	5089380	Um
5089380	5094820	The first thing I checked and mama mama mercy checked was uh
5097860	5100180	Was was to see if I had a fever
5102340	5104340	And
5105300	5107300	And uh, she was like, oh no, no
5108500	5111140	There's no fever. So we're good there
5112980	5116340	Time to wash everything in your life. Trust me. I already did
5116740	5119460	Uh, right now my my bed sheets are in
5120420	5122420	the laundry
5122980	5126500	Do you ever find the cause of the rash? I have no idea. I have no idea senpai
5127140	5128820	I have no idea
5128820	5130820	I literally woke up
5131300	5136100	And I was like my arm's really itchy. Why and then suddenly my entire arm became
5136820	5139780	Like very quickly when I woke up
5140740	5144900	Became all rash and I was like panicking. I was like, oh my god. What do I do?
5146820	5148820	Oh
5149140	5152020	It's very itchy. That's probably
5153460	5155140	the most
5155140	5163380	Annoying part of it and it's on my dominant arm. I think the most itchiest parts are like at the wrist and the elbows
5167860	5169860	So that's why I was like
5170820	5177460	I took a shower just in case it was like an allergy like contact allergy and it was still there. So I was like, oh
5180260	5183780	The food allergies, um, I don't know
5184900	5188420	Usually if I have a food allergy, it's like the entire body
5189380	5191140	goals into
5191140	5193140	goals until like
5193140	5195140	issue
5195460	5197460	Maybe you have bed bugs. Um
5198260	5200260	highly unlikely
5200900	5204260	And I'm pretty because these are definitely not bites because I went to the doctor
5204340	5209060	She was like, oh, yeah allergies is definitely something allergy related
5211380	5216740	Um, do you use ac? Uh, no, actually it's been quite cold recently
5218420	5220420	No changes in washing detergents or anything. No
5222660	5224660	No, nothing
5225140	5227140	Thank you for the super chat charlie
5228180	5230180	I'm not reading that
5233780	5236340	Sorry not right now not right now
5251380	5255060	Maybe new clothes. Yeah. Yeah, maybe maybe it's new clothes. I mean like
5255620	5259300	It did happen when when uh, mama mercy
5264660	5269220	Mama mercy was like, oh, I'm gonna give you my old clothes
5271860	5276500	And I said, okay, so I got her old clothes that she wore when
5278420	5280420	Um
5280900	5286580	When she was like younger and then I guess I wore some of those and I don't know maybe
5288580	5290420	Maybe
5290420	5294420	It would have been that but it was like washed
5296020	5298020	That might be the reason
5298740	5300340	but
5300340	5302340	I don't know it could have been
5303780	5305620	the
5305620	5307460	Like polyester or something
5307540	5310740	But then that doesn't explain it because then I like took off the clothes

6076900	6083300	Can make appointments and phone calls and I can drive so I don't know one step closer
6086420	6091140	That's one step closer to like, you know
6100260	6102900	Oh and my credit score is fine too my credit score is fine
6105220	6107220	Oh
6112660	6117380	Driving what a showoff. Yeah, I drive I drive the family minivan
6118500	6121540	Oh, you laugh like a dolphin. That's it. I know I know I know
6122660	6125220	There are several laughs that I have
6126500	6128500	I think
6129460	6141780	I've been called a windshield wiper. I've been called a squeaky door. I've been called a dolphin
6150340	6156020	Are you an aggressive driver? Not particularly. I consider myself a defensive driver
6156740	6161620	T kettle is what I think of I think most people say it's windshield wiper
6168420	6174820	Or like, you know, when you put windex on a cloth and go squeak squeak squeak, that's what some of my laughs sound like
6174820	6188900	Find your laugh really cute. Thank you. I feel like it's one of my, um, charm points
6190740	6193940	Charm points? Yeah, I think it's one of my charm points
6194820	6196820	Sometimes I sound like a creaky door too
6196900	6198900	I
6201700	6208740	It's one of my charm points definitely something that uh people take notice of even IRL
6217540	6222500	Uh, I don't know what my other charm points are my inability to read
6222820	6231060	Okay, we're almost done Senpai. Sorry. Sorry about that
6237300	6239300	We're almost done
6244180	6246180	Oh
6246500	6253780	I think my other charm point would be
6255780	6260980	Uh, I guess maybe you've noticed I make a lot of mouth noises
6263620	6266900	A lot of mouth noises where it's like
6276900	6285620	You're also the first VTuber that plays SMT outside of persona. That's hella charming. What is my charm point the type of games I play?
6293060	6299540	That can't be that can't be it, right? My gamer scores might it's my um
6301700	6304820	It's my charm point only if you play knock turn on normal
6304980	6306980	Uh
6315060	6317380	Part of it I've never seen anyone play harvester I
6318340	6324740	Seriously, I feel like I played very early on and when I started streaming
6325620	6330500	Uh, that's such a long time ago when I say such a long time ago. That's like three years
6331460	6333460	three years ago, um
6335620	6337620	I
6339620	6346180	Play nothing about pointing clicks. So now I'm running out of pointing clicks. I'm running out of pointing clicks to play
6348500	6354260	I mean I could play it again, but I don't know it just loses this magic if you like play again
6358980	6360980	I mean with the crowd I think
6365700	6367700	I
6368100	6370100	Can't play visual novels next I have
6371060	6372900	two visual novels
6372900	6374900	that I want to I want to read
6375460	6378420	with senpai one is completely uh
6382420	6384420	Not great
6385060	6394020	One is completely not great and probably would be a turnoff to a lot of people, but I'm waiting for uh
6395460	6397460	Oh
6397780	6402820	It's an ad friendly. No, I'm waiting for the uh, hold on
6404500	6406500	Streams
6409140	6411780	And the other one I'm thinking is dona dona
6412580	6414580	Uh
6424180	6426180	But the other one is uh
6428020	6430020	Is uh
6431620	6433620	Poilet stuff
6435140	6437140	Let's just say that
6437300	6445620	It's a bit it's a funny considered the worst one of the worst vns
6447940	6449940	Ever made
6452580	6456260	It's not great, but it is comedic
6457220	6467700	It is comedic and it's really gross. It's really gross
6471460	6474260	I think some of you already know it. I see it in chat already
6477140	6482100	I see it in chat already. I think it'll be funny at least
6483060	6485060	It's gross
6486900	6488740	But funny
6488740	6490900	So I think that'll be an interesting stream
6491940	6493940	Definitely not one where you're like
6494740	6499220	I'm gonna jork it's more like morbid curiosity
6502180	6504180	I'm gonna I'm that's my
6506020	6508020	That's my
6512660	6518660	You know assumption my assumption
6529140	6534020	My assumption I mean like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna shame you for what you like but at the same time
6534340	6536340	I'm going to guess
6536340	6538340	It's
6538660	6541780	Not exactly like a a a a
6542900	6546660	It's one that people are going to miss out on yes, just because of the subject
6553300	6556340	Just because of the subject so I think that one is
6557620	6560580	For fun and I definitely don't expect anyone to be like
6561460	6563460	I'm I'm cumin
6564420	6566420	I don't expect anything
6566420	6572340	Anyone to be like I'm cumin and I'm expecting a much less big audience for that one than my other ones
6573300	6575460	I'm also interested in playing. Um
6576660	6578660	Some really gory ones
6579380	6583140	Like I think what was it megad bites bites is that one?
6585140	6587140	Uh and
6587620	6589620	I
6589940	6591940	Megan baits. Yeah baits. Yeah
6595220	6597220	Um
6598500	6600500	And
6600980	6606740	Maybe muvelove muvelove I hear muvelove is like one of those games that it's like a must to play
6610180	6613380	Well the stream is on the other platform be paywall. No it will not
6614340	6615780	uh
6615780	6618500	I'm planning what I'm planning for the other stream
6619700	6622660	Is uh for a little funsy onesie
6624740	6631300	Um, it's free as long as you follow because we don't want any uh, we don't want any trouble
6632900	6638020	We don't want any twubble right so it's free if you follow and uh
6639140	6641140	With some incentives

6665940	6667940	But yes, it will be free
6669780	6671780	It will be free. I don't plan on like
6672420	6677060	Paywalling that it's a streaming site. I feel like it's it shouldn't be pay walled
6681380	6683380	Incentives to help keep the vibes, yeah
6686580	6688580	Yeah
6689140	6691140	Yeah, the good vibes going
6696100	6697620	We're free of course

6702660	6708420	And also, um, I don't know. I don't know but I saw a lot of people asking if like vods will be like up
6708900	6715860	Uh, you see the thing is on the other website. There is no vods. There are no vods vods do not get saved
6726580	6728180	So I don't think so
6728180	6733540	Oh, yeah, I people are like, oh, can we watch the mods for free and I'm like, I don't even think there is vods
6738020	6740020	There I don't think there is vods
6745460	6749860	Yeah, you recorded yourself. Yeah, I don't feel like that maybe
6751940	6756420	The question is where to host it. I know. Oh, yeah, uh hosting stuff seems
6757220	6759220	hard
6761620	6767620	I'll I'll I'll talk to strongy about it. I'll talk to strongy and management about it when the time comes
6768180	6771860	Because uh, right now I want to focus on my youtube stuff
6773780	6777300	I want to focus on my youtube stuff or for funsies
6778660	6780660	and also because, um
6781540	6783540	You know
6784420	6787700	In the end I do want to be seen as like sort of
6791220	6794420	Not not I don't want to be seen as
6797780	6799780	A brand risk
6800260	6807380	Oh, okay, that sounds so bad when I say it. I don't want to be seen as like a brand risk where I I might like, um
6807380	6809380	Um
6812180	6819700	I might I might cause some of my friends company to be like, no, no, you can't you can't collab with with her. I don't want that
6821780	6828100	I don't want that. Oh, I'll wait for like 10k. Maybe I'll wait until 10k for like fans extremes. Who knows?
6838100	6840100	So
6844100	6852740	Yeah, I just want to be sure. Oh, what did I didn't censor? Oh man, my bad
6854820	6856820	You didn't hear that
6857540	6859540	um
6860100	6865700	I don't want I don't want to like, uh, I don't want to make people uncomfortable, right? Like public a public facing
6865700	6867700	I want to be seen as
6867700	6876100	Uh pretty decent, but uh privately. I'm just uh in alternate places. Uh, we're free. We got free reign. We got free reign
6882420	6884420	You got free reign
6891460	6893780	You only stream on youtube. Yeah, I only stream on youtube. Yeah
6894740	6897540	Anything that I said before that was all fake fake news
6901460	6903460	Um
6903460	6907300	Yeah, I just want to make sure that when it comes to corpals because I have a lot of friends
6908020	6910020	in like different corporal
6913380	6917860	Which I I would love to you know, uh
6923780	6925780	It was uh
6926580	6928580	Definitely something that I want
6929300	6933700	I want to like hang out with my other friends and I don't want to become like a brand risk where it's like
6933780	6937060	Oh, I can never work with my friends ever again, you know
6940820	6945140	But I definitely don't mind having that other image. Uh
6946260	6951460	Behind behind places where if you want that content you search for it
6954500	6956500	That's kind of thing
6960900	6965300	Viola is kind of a brand risk in itself. I think personally some pie
6966020	6970740	I think we're really not that different from any other, uh companies
6971860	6975780	There's a lot of companies that also do uh alternate. Um
6976900	6978660	asmr stuff
6978660	6980180	so
6980180	6982180	I feel like um
6983060	6984820	We're not
6984820	6987140	Really different from any other company. Um
6987940	6995700	The advertisement as we are a little bit on the the the spicier side. I feel like that's definitely to capture attention
6998500	7003060	That's definitely to capture attention and we do advertise advertise it
7005620	7008180	But that's the only difference
7008740	7010740	I
7011220	7015940	Don't think it's even as spicy or other corpse can get away with with it
7018420	7020420	Yeah, it's the kind of hook
7024180	7028340	It's a bit more I feel like it's not as spicy in my opinion
7031220	7033220	I feel like it's quite normal
7034180	7040980	Okay, okay, um senpai's I'm gonna have to go up again and put away the ice pack because it's completely melted here
7041620	7043620	It's completely melted
7044180	7046680	So I'm gonna put it back in the freezer
7063220	7065220	So
7093220	7095220	So
7123220	7125220	So
7133940	7138420	Senpai's playing games here, okay now we now we're gaming

7183640	7185400	But yeah
7185400	7187800	Fruitful fruitful conversation. I hope I hope
7188600	7192120	That's my plan. Um, at least that's my plan
7192680	7194680	but if uh
7194760	7200760	If management's like no or if scrawny's like, I don't know then uh all that plan gone
7202200	7204200	All that plan is gone

7400200	7405720	And I ain't talking about cheap tricks like swallowing goldfish or cramming your head into a rubber glove
7406120	7410280	They're on a whole other plane. I saw it with my own eyes heroes for our age

7437080	7443400	What a sick sight and then what did she do? She flattened a wall right before my eyes. She must have taken out some kind of barrier
7446520	7448520	That's what kai day's blood can do
7449240	7452920	Sometimes her arms suck blood. That's some stuff. I didn't need to see either
7454040	7456200	Masked a smith is still a mystery
7456760	7459320	But I do know that he can do some sweet wrestling moves
7460600	7464200	He was a small town pro wrestler who drew crowds to main events
7464360	7469080	But just before he made his debut in the new york scene. He mysteriously disappeared
7470040	7472040	This is common knowledge amongst fans

9377860	9379860	Chief you watch yourself
9380860	9388260	The ethics agents or hyenas are a motley crew of rejects, but the assassins trained in the core
9388820	9394900	Now those guys are what about after the Yakumo party cabinet policy or Yakumo for short

9560180	9566260	Continuing my report Kevin Smith never fails to amaze you won't believe this but it's the straight-up truth
9566260	9568900	The sucker is a real-life invisible man. Oh
9569820	9572300	Plenty I teach an interesting name
9573740	9575740	Why must they taught me like that?
9577020	9583420	At first even I didn't believe it. This has got to be a hoax, right? Oh shit the guys for real and
9584580	9587020	Then con Smith what a pain in the ass punk?
9587020	9593140	I can never catch him it blows my socks off nine times. He speeds off. He disappears
9593580	9599420	That's right. This appears Olympic records mean nothing with him running around
9600660	9602660	Coyote Smith has a thing a
9603220	9609880	Thing for being a crook, but he's not like other thugs. He's fit. He jumps like an animal incredible
9610860	9613620	Athleticism not to mention he can pick any padlock
9614340	9620300	Must pick this up as a method of survival in a rough neighborhood and then there's Garcia and Smith
9620300	9624720	I really haven't seen much seeing him much so everything. I know is based on conjecture
9624940	9628900	You and rumor has it he can spot the heavens mile a mile away

10731620	10733620	Know that like a lot of people
10739020	10742860	A lot of people say things for the end of stream, but I'm just like
10743540	10745100	That's that's okay, right?
10745100	10749420	That's okay to like kind of do some of them at the end of stream and some of them like in the middle, right?
10749420	10751420	I'm not really sure
10753940	10755940	And I really share
10757860	10759860	It's your call really
10761860	10764740	That's good to do either way. It's all about the mullet
10767140	10773380	And it depends on the screen okay, cuz I'm just like oh, I don't really know
10780340	10782340	I
10785340	10787980	Don't really know the etiquette, but whoa, whoa, we'll see

10813020	10815020	YouTube streams

10820820	10822820	They didn't have any of the stuff
10827980	10831700	I wonder how reading soup buzz and effects engagement I have no idea

10836620	10838980	is with like hollow live and
10840860	10846540	I don't know. I feel like that's kind of we don't play by that rule because
10847540	10850020	Obviously, it's not as big of a
10852580	10854580	Of a of a crowd
10857860	10859860	Different standards. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

11418700	11420780	So I'm gonna hang out with friends and stuff
11422580	11427460	Wednesday is death mark again. Well, I know death mark is not a very popular game
11427980	11434140	But I want to relax and I think that would be really really great if we we all relax
11435140	11437140	Relax while I read
11439140	11446860	Thursday is the untitled goose game collab with straw knee so we're going to have a lot of fun with that
11449140	11450820	And
11450820	11457460	Followed by that is another day off and then the uno collab which by the way my time is not correct
11457460	11461900	So please check the other girls's calendars to see if it's correct
11465140	11468580	Because yeah, it's not correct on my on my schedule
11471020	11472420	And
11472420	11477580	Then I have another day off. So I have three days off this week
11478220	11482220	Hopefully I can recover my arms and my legs and stuff. I
11483340	11488460	Was a game called death mark relaxing. It's not but it is a visual novel
11488980	11493380	So it's not like it's not it can be played one-handed
11494540	11499260	It can be played one-handed and so I don't put strain on like this this this hand
11509460	11511460	So yeah, I'm trying to
11513660	11519820	To to rest this arm hopefully it was it won't
11519820	11521820	Oh
11522700	11524700	It won't
11525820	11528620	It is ill it is like a bit time though
11528620	11535220	So the visual novel has like quick time events, but like I think they're kind of okay quick time events. So it's not
11536380	11538060	too
11538060	11541380	Not too stressful. Yeah
11543260	11548340	She's rest filled Sigma. I don't know what that means. What does Sigma mean?
11550260	11552260	I
11553780	11555780	Yeah, quick time events are
11555940	11559140	Yeah, that one there's some quick time events. I think
11560060	11567020	There's a little bit at stake. So we'll see we'll see and I was not not too not too fun, but it's uh
11569940	11571940	It's
11572260	11574260	Oh
11575820	11579980	What's the word it's it's it's a game where we can relax and I
11584780	11588020	Yeah, so that's for the schedule this week
11593020	11599060	I'm hoping I'm gonna figure out something so I'm hoping to open up membership streams
11600060	11601660	Uh soon
11601660	11607660	I don't really know what people do for them for membership streams, but I guess like you just do whatever, right?

11628140	11630140	Remember
11630460	11632460	So that
