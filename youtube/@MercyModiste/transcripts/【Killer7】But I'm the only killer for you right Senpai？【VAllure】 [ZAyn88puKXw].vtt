08:35.640 --> 08:37.900
Silence, silence.

08:37.900 --> 08:40.380
You guys want to hear the game, right?

08:42.340 --> 08:43.580
I'm a mama mama mama.

08:43.580 --> 08:45.900
Oh no, wait, you can't even hear the game.

08:45.900 --> 08:49.380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

08:49.380 --> 08:52.580

Oh my gosh.

09:08.460 --> 09:11.740
It's so funny, I'm like, yeah, I have everything ready.

09:11.740 --> 09:13.460
I set up my controller.

09:13.460 --> 09:15.340
I made sure everything's fine.

09:15.340 --> 09:17.660
Of course I forget one thing.

09:17.660 --> 09:18.780
Tee hee, pet up.

09:18.780 --> 09:23.780
Oh, let's call this, uh, monitor sound.

09:39.980 --> 09:44.220
I got so nervous I had to run to the bathroom.

09:44.220 --> 09:46.580
I mean, I ran to my idle meeting.

09:47.580 --> 09:48.580
Uh-huh.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.220
Is this the one?

10:01.860 --> 10:03.460
No, I set my idle meeting.

10:03.460 --> 10:04.500
Shut up.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.340
Did you wash your hands?

10:05.340 --> 10:06.780
Of course I washed my hands.

10:08.740 --> 10:10.540
Is this the right one?

10:10.540 --> 10:15.540
Oh, that's bad, that's bad that I can't do this.

10:16.900 --> 10:19.220

10:27.300 --> 10:28.900
Okay.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.540
Hello?

10:30.540 --> 10:31.580
Hello, hello?

10:39.620 --> 10:41.700

10:50.940 --> 10:52.340
Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool.

10:53.580 --> 10:54.780
How's the volume for everyone?

10:54.780 --> 10:57.220
I'm gonna adjust my own volume

10:57.220 --> 10:58.860
just so I can hear some more,

10:58.860 --> 11:03.620
but the volume for a bit, a bit, it's a little different.

11:03.620 --> 11:04.940

11:04.940 --> 11:05.780
Let me know, okay?

11:08.860 --> 11:09.820
Okay, okay, okay.

11:09.820 --> 11:11.380
It's all good, a little bit loud.

You guys are not going to complain about normal, right?

11:54.780 --> 12:00.500
My senpais aren't going to complain about normal, right?

12:00.500 --> 12:01.500
Normal is fine.

12:01.500 --> 12:10.100

12:18.100 --> 12:19.100
Wait.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.100

12:52.100 --> 12:54.900

12:54.900 --> 12:56.100

12:56.100 --> 12:58.500
Is he going to tickle you?

12:58.500 --> 13:01.100
Huh?

13:01.100 --> 13:02.700
I can't read this.

13:02.700 --> 13:04.700
Hahaha!

13:09.300 --> 13:12.300
Oh, by the way, I am playing on the Xbox controller.

13:12.300 --> 13:17.700
Um, I read that there's like mixed reviews on the controls, so I'm going to try my best.

13:21.700 --> 13:24.700
Garcian Smith.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.700
Did I totally butcher that name?

13:26.700 --> 13:28.700
Hahaha!

13:31.100 --> 13:41.700
Oh yeah, I set up dynamic lighting and everything, so we can have feels.

13:41.700 --> 13:43.700
Oh, they're passing each other.

13:43.700 --> 13:44.700
What are they passing?

13:44.700 --> 13:45.700
Christopher Mills.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.700
What are they passing?

13:46.700 --> 13:47.700
Is it drugs?

13:47.700 --> 13:50.700
Is it a video game?

13:53.700 --> 13:55.700
Kenchi Angel, thank you.

14:01.700 --> 14:05.700

Haha, passing the mixtape?

14:13.700 --> 14:16.700
Yeah, check out my mixtape.

14:20.700 --> 14:21.700
Yeah.

14:21.700 --> 14:22.700
That's where they all hang out.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.700
Your information tells us that there's 14 of them.

14:24.700 --> 14:25.700
14?

14:25.700 --> 14:27.700
And they're all fun.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.700
Nah, I keep one alive so we can ask for the bosses.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.700
Anything else I shouldn't know?

14:33.700 --> 14:34.700
No.

14:34.700 --> 14:35.700
Not really.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.700
You'll know when you see them, they're, uh, different.

14:38.700 --> 14:39.700
What do you mean different?

14:39.700 --> 14:41.700
We'll do one.

14:41.700 --> 14:42.700
May the Lord smile.

14:42.700 --> 14:44.700
And the devil have mercy.

14:44.700 --> 14:45.700
Have you ever played Mass Effect?

14:45.700 --> 14:51.700
No, I have very bad motion sickness, so this is my motion sickness training, everyone!

14:52.700 --> 14:59.700
A free-for-all fight in the multi-purpose facility's Celtic Building, assignment number 33.

Destroy the Heaven Smile headquarters and capture the chief alive!

15:04.700 --> 15:05.700
Hahaha!

15:05.700 --> 15:07.700

Do you wish to learn the controls?

15:10.700 --> 15:11.700
Yeah!

15:15.700 --> 15:17.700
Use A to run.

15:17.700 --> 15:18.700
Huh?

15:18.700 --> 15:19.700
Oh!

15:19.700 --> 15:22.700

15:25.700 --> 15:26.700
Right trigger.

15:26.700 --> 15:27.700
That was my left.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.700
Ready your weapon.

bullets, he loves them so, the bullets were left behind by masters, so the servants searched

25:21.320 --> 25:30.320

okay, I don't want to study, it's okay, we're gonna study together, this is how we learn things,

32:14.360 --> 32:21.480

32:22.200 --> 32:30.920
have you got used to the junctions, here's how to read them, junctions that you've already passed turn

32:30.920 --> 32:43.000
blue, junctions that you have not passed are clear, if you get confused, follow the gray to come back,

32:43.560 --> 32:49.480

32:54.840 --> 33:01.480

33:01.480 --> 33:13.880

33:15.480 --> 33:23.720
vitalities, okay, master, we're in a tight spot, I just, I can just sense it, look at those eyes,

33:24.040 --> 33:31.960
eyes that see right through you, as they close, the member weakens,

33:34.680 --> 33:41.480
when they shut completely, the member dies, you must continue to feed it blood, oh we're gonna

33:41.480 --> 33:50.280
feed blood to our member, huh, you can use a test tube, when the eyes turn red, keep an eye on them,

33:51.240 --> 33:57.960
the name of Haruma, okay, okay, we're going through this,

34:04.680 --> 34:10.360

Azura, oh thank you Azura for the raid, Azura, Azura, Azura, Azura,

36:05.460 --> 36:10.180
Da, da, da, da, da, da, assou da da da.

36:13.580 --> 36:15.380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

36:19.300 --> 36:24.300
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sempai's, assou da.

36:26.380 --> 36:28.340
Okay, Xbox controller should be the ones

36:28.340 --> 36:29.740
with the two squares on it.

36:33.020 --> 36:34.500
Well, it says return to title screen.

36:34.500 --> 36:39.040
Do I have to do it while in this screen instead?

36:43.900 --> 36:45.700
Or maybe I just don't have items yet.

36:47.060 --> 36:47.900
Whatever.

36:47.900 --> 36:50.700
But welcome everyone.

36:50.700 --> 36:52.700
I'm just having trouble with controls right now.

36:52.700 --> 36:55.340
So I'm doing a little bit of studying.

36:56.860 --> 36:57.800
A little bit of studying

36:57.800 --> 37:00.020
because this game's a little bit funky,

37:00.020 --> 37:01.300
but we'll get it, we'll get it.

37:01.300 --> 37:04.540
I mean, I, admittedly, the games I played,

37:04.540 --> 37:08.060
two to 51 games I played, Killer is Dead.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.260
I thought I played Killer Seven at first,

37:10.260 --> 37:15.260
but it turns out I was playing Killer is Dead instead.

37:16.700 --> 37:17.860
I need a rhyme.

37:19.340 --> 37:24.340
And I played The Silver Case.

37:25.980 --> 37:30.300
I've also played, what's the sequel to The Silver Case?

37:30.300 --> 37:31.140
That one.

37:33.060 --> 37:37.780
And I think that's it.

37:37.780 --> 37:39.180
I think that's it.

37:39.180 --> 37:42.420
All I played of two to 51 games.

37:45.740 --> 37:51.220
So those are the games that I've played.

37:51.220 --> 37:54.660
I'm not very familiar with this type of gameplay.

37:54.660 --> 37:59.660
I'm very bad at shooty games

37:59.860 --> 38:02.940
because I've never played shooting a game before as well.

38:06.020 --> 38:08.060
Did you understand The Silver Case?

38:08.060 --> 38:13.060
I really liked The Silver Case the most.

38:16.420 --> 38:19.540
I went through all 100 endings of the sequel.

38:19.540 --> 38:20.380
What was it called again?

38:20.380 --> 38:21.300
The 25th Ward.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.140
Yeah.

38:22.140 --> 38:24.780
It was great.

38:25.780 --> 38:30.780
So I like that game, but it was more of a,

38:41.180 --> 38:45.260
it was more of a, what do you call it?

38:45.260 --> 38:47.460
More of a visual novel in my opinion.

38:47.460 --> 38:50.260
It was more of a visual novel, a little bit of walking.

38:50.260 --> 38:51.460
So I think that was fine.

38:55.780 --> 39:00.780
So I did all the endings and then all I got was,

39:02.140 --> 39:03.940
oh no, should I?

39:03.940 --> 39:06.540
Oh no, that's a spoiler, right?

39:06.540 --> 39:07.980
That's a spoiler, right?

39:10.340 --> 39:12.380
I don't know if I can spoil it.

39:22.540 --> 39:23.820
Yeah, I'm not gonna spoil it.

39:24.780 --> 39:25.620
Mm.

39:32.420 --> 39:33.740
Was it disappointing?

39:33.740 --> 39:35.100
You can spoil it?

39:35.100 --> 39:36.820
Mm, okay, okay.

39:36.820 --> 39:40.860
Well, it's only because Senpai said that I can spoil it.

39:40.860 --> 39:44.220
Well, all you have to get is Kamali telling you,

39:44.220 --> 39:45.860
asking you for a loan.

39:45.860 --> 39:50.860
Ha ha ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha, ha ha ha.

39:50.860 --> 39:54.460
Getting us into the multi-level marketing, the MLM.

39:55.300 --> 39:56.140
Project.

39:58.620 --> 39:59.540
What was it?

39:59.540 --> 40:03.180
Can I have a loan of like 50,000 and or something?

40:03.180 --> 40:04.680
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

40:10.820 --> 40:13.820
Anyways, yeah, basically trying to convince us to go

40:13.820 --> 40:16.660
into their little MLM project, eh?

40:16.660 --> 40:17.580
Ha ha ha ha ha.

40:20.020 --> 40:22.540
2 to 51 likes to mock player 200% in his games

40:22.540 --> 40:24.300
and I did 100% it.

40:24.460 --> 40:28.140
Yeah, I really did.

40:29.740 --> 40:31.700
Give me a loan, the end, pretty much.

40:31.700 --> 40:35.340
Ha ha ha ha ha ha, it was fun though, it was fun.

40:35.340 --> 40:36.620
I don't regret it.

40:38.140 --> 40:40.420
I don't regret it, but definitely,

40:40.420 --> 40:41.580
I know what I'm getting into,

40:41.580 --> 40:43.540
it's just that I gotta get used to the game play.

40:43.540 --> 40:44.660
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

40:47.020 --> 40:52.020
Speaking of MLMs, have you guys, have my Senpais.

40:52.340 --> 40:54.140
Ooh, okay, we're in a tight spot, sorry.

40:54.740 --> 40:56.380
You mustn't get lost.

40:56.380 --> 40:58.100
If you do, use the X button.

40:58.100 --> 41:00.020
Mm, mm, mm, mm, okay.

41:00.020 --> 41:05.020
Go open a map, collect all the soul shells, get lost,

41:06.540 --> 41:10.260
follow the icon, in the name of Harman.

41:10.260 --> 41:14.220
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

41:14.220 --> 41:16.060
Continuing that story, sorry about that.

41:16.060 --> 41:20.460
I acted, my fingies clicked faster than I could.

41:20.460 --> 41:22.620
Oh, just give me a second.

41:25.140 --> 41:27.820
I'm gonna just close this window.

41:27.820 --> 41:28.740
Sistracting.

41:30.100 --> 41:33.180
Ha ha ha, excuse me.

41:33.180 --> 41:36.220
Let me just, have you guys ever,

41:36.220 --> 41:41.220
have my Senpais ever gotten tricked into,

41:41.220 --> 41:46.220
into like going to a pyramid scheme party before?

41:55.140 --> 41:57.420
Ha ha ha, because I have,

41:57.420 --> 42:02.420
ha ha ha ha, I have an old friend from high school

42:03.380 --> 42:06.100
was like, we love to meet up again.

42:06.100 --> 42:07.820
And I said, yeah, sure.

42:07.820 --> 42:08.980
Then I thought about it for a second.

42:08.980 --> 42:11.820
I said, it's not a pyramid scheme, is it?

42:12.740 --> 42:15.740
They assured me, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

42:15.740 --> 42:19.140
It's not a, it's not a pyramid scheme.

42:19.140 --> 42:21.740
Just come over and we'll hang out, like good old times.

42:21.740 --> 42:22.580
I said, okay.

42:23.580 --> 42:25.820
So I drive all the way there.

42:26.700 --> 42:28.940
All the way to there, in the middle of nowhere.

42:30.300 --> 42:31.140
Ha ha ha.

42:35.700 --> 42:37.900
I thought I was gonna die.

42:39.020 --> 42:41.620
Because it was so far away, there were no lights

42:41.620 --> 42:42.860
or anything, I was really worried.

42:42.860 --> 42:43.980
I was like, where the heck?

42:43.980 --> 42:48.500
So I got to a very opulent mansion.

42:48.500 --> 42:50.900
I'm sorry, I'm telling you guys,

42:50.900 --> 42:52.620
I'm telling you my supplies of story.

42:52.620 --> 42:53.620
Well, it doesn't matter,

42:53.620 --> 42:55.660
you're stuck in the basement anyways.

42:59.060 --> 43:01.820
Opulent mansion with like barely anything in it.

43:01.820 --> 43:06.820
So I walk in and I meet her friends

43:09.100 --> 43:13.460
who are showing off their opulent mansion

43:13.460 --> 43:16.660
with their quote unquote

43:17.540 --> 43:22.540
real medieval night suits, whatever it is, you know?

43:25.660 --> 43:27.260
They have one, they said it's authentic.

43:27.260 --> 43:30.180
I was like, it ain't authentic, brother.

43:31.540 --> 43:34.740
It's not authentic, it was that shiny.

43:39.300 --> 43:44.300
Yeah, they're like, it's a medieval, it's old, it's there.

43:47.660 --> 43:52.500
And then I see this product around and then

43:53.940 --> 43:58.940
I basically just said, look, just give me the whole fricking,

44:03.900 --> 44:06.860
give me the whole fricking story right now.

44:07.700 --> 44:12.620
I'm tired, please just give me the whole spiel right now.

44:12.620 --> 44:15.580
So they sat me down and then they gave me the whole spiel

44:17.500 --> 44:22.980
and then I said, that's nice, I'm gonna go eat now.

44:22.980 --> 44:26.540
And I ate all the charcuterie board

44:26.540 --> 44:29.100
and like the energy drinks and I brought them home with me

44:29.100 --> 44:30.220
and then I left.

44:42.220 --> 44:43.220
Great times.

44:46.660 --> 44:51.660
It's really funny, they're like, it's not a pyramid scheme.

44:52.580 --> 44:56.580
Hands me a literal pamphlet with a literal pyramid

45:04.180 --> 45:05.520
on the pamphlet.

45:06.820 --> 45:09.020
It's really funny, they're like,

45:09.020 --> 45:12.780
it's not a pyramid scheme, hands me a literal pamphlet

45:12.780 --> 45:16.340
with a literal pyramid on the pamphlet.

45:16.660 --> 45:27.220
I left I left I was so I was so worried I was gonna get killed but then I was

45:27.220 --> 45:34.900
like well you made me go through this entire you know video seminar thing of

45:34.900 --> 45:39.420

45:39.420 --> 45:56.700
you know chow down good times

45:57.180 --> 46:02.820
good times I was like yeah that's nice I'll think about it about the food though

46:02.820 --> 46:15.300
you said there was food and then I left and then yeah I never heard from them

46:15.300 --> 46:21.220
ever again I never heard from her ever again so that was that was something

46:21.220 --> 46:29.060
sorry I'm so that's sick

46:51.220 --> 46:56.820

yesterday I didn't want to worry anyone yesterday but before stream I was

47:01.860 --> 47:06.700
really worried I had to cancel because when I said okay well I feel a little

47:06.700 --> 47:13.020
funky so I'm gonna go I had to do an idol meeting and I say I was doing my

47:13.020 --> 47:19.820

47:56.580 --> 48:03.180

56:23.420 --> 56:29.580
great dragon tumbles to his death those strange gold particles it can only be

56:29.580 --> 56:37.820

57:27.740 --> 57:30.260
everything

57:36.420 --> 57:45.740
master we're in a tight spot a real tight spot their bombs are absolutely deadly

57:45.860 --> 57:50.180
yeah I figured that out I don't even take out our personas if a persona die

57:50.180 --> 58:01.060
leave it to Garcian you may be a big oaf but he's a master cleaner yes there's a

58:01.060 --> 58:10.260
job for everyone oh and don't forget after he cleans up reanimate the persona

58:10.260 --> 58:18.420
from the paper bag rapidly press the A button to revive in the name of Harman

58:18.580 --> 58:24.820
they did this on purpose oh Suda did this on purpose he made me die on purpose

58:24.820 --> 58:31.380
getting so confused about the tutorial to get to the real tutorial that's so rude

58:31.380 --> 58:41.580
master we're in a tight spot the skill is extraordinary the hellion Dan loves

58:41.580 --> 58:47.140
destruction he's bound to destroy the enemy's nest just the Y button three

58:47.140 --> 58:55.020
times while holding the gun with the R button three test tubes will be equipped

Kaede's special attacks

59:15.420 --> 59:22.860
master we're in a tight spot the skill is extraordinary barefooted Kaede as a

59:23.020 --> 59:28.260

standing ready with the R button you'll switch to a sculpt view allowing you to

59:38.260 --> 59:44.700
hit long-ranged creeds in the name of Harman

59:44.740 --> 59:55.980
okay why an R that might be a little hard to remember these I hope I hope

59:55.980 --> 01:00:00.300
Senpai's don't mind that I'm going through all of this

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:13.260
master we're in a tight spot not really that tight let me explain how blood

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:22.140
works the blood in the beaker is pure give blood to the doctor inside the TV

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:29.740
the doctor may look a bit off but he's a true gentleman he won't do you wrong

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:36.380
prepare blood serums for you use them to give personas a heightened consciousness

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:46.060
level up this allows a member to achieve special attacks in the name of Harman

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:50.740
all right

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:59.660
all right all right blood absorption master we're in a tight spot this blood

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:08.100
is scary stuff but without blood there is no tomorrow the persona can absorb the

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:12.460
blood out of the enemy and acts as a stabilizer to help handle multiple

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:22.340
personalities without blood your very life is in danger press start slash pause

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:35.460
to check the blood form you must use blood wisely in the name of Harman awakening

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:43.900
master we're in a tight spot there's no way to put it there's no other way to

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:52.460
put it your personas killer seven are not in step yes start slash pause check

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:58.500
the condition of each persona and only use those in good shape restore

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:04.900
condition by taking out the enemy if you exterminate enough you can wake up

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:13.900
personas that you didn't murder makes the blood boil enter the TV to wake them

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:23.820

Alright!

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:09.220
Sorry, it looked like an R.

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.220
Should I select Dan again?

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:27.220

01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:57.220
Oops!

01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:04.220
You got better, though!

01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:05.220
Yeah, I'm getting better!

01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:07.220
Just a little bit.

01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:11.220
I'm trying to kinda still understand the mechanics.

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:20.220
It's a little tough, but I think I got quite a bit of it.

01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:22.220
Ah!

01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:45.220
Look, I'm a cleaner.

01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:47.220
I can feel no remorse for seeing that.

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:51.220
Ah!

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:01.220
Yeah, you gotta keep my distance with those eggs.

01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:09.220
This time real.

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:10.220
Probably.

01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:14.220
I'm a little confused about how to do the...

01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:16.220
the special move again.

01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:21.220
I know it's R and then hitting the Y button three times, right?

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.220
Do I smash?

01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:25.220
I'll try my best.

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:26.220
Whatever.

01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:28.220
When it comes, it comes.

01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:29.220
Okay.

01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:46.220
I'm bad.

01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.220
Ah!

01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:57.220
Not again!

01:17:58.220 --> 01:17:59.220
Ah!

01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:10.220
This is too easy.

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.220
They crawl so fast!

01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:29.220
Ah!

01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:38.220
This is too easy.

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:51.220
This is too easy.

01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:02.220
Wait, where's the weakness?

01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:30.220
A little shot.

01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:39.220
You guys are so close!

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:45.220
I understand!

01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:46.220
I understand it!

01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:56.220
This is just a duplicator.

01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:57.220
Bad girl!

01:19:57.220 --> 01:20:00.220
An egg laying heaven smile.

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:03.220
Refitted to clamp down on the city.

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:06.220
This sucker pumped out the countless duplicates

01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:09.220
that took this country down.

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.220
Hey, Smith.

01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:15.220
It's your job to eradicate heaven smile, right?

01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:19.220
And seek the queen.

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:24.220
The gatekeeper is in charge of the queen.

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:28.220
Give this to the gatekeeper.

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:29.220
He won't be disappointed.

01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:32.220
Is that Pizza Hut?

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:35.220
Is that the Pizza Hut love?

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:37.220
Pull it.

01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:41.220
Received Soul Shell.

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:47.220
Okay.

01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:59.220
Is that Pizza Hut logo?

01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:00.220
Yeah.

01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:04.220
I did it!

01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:07.220
Are you guys, are my supplies proud of me?

01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:08.220
Can I get a head pat?

01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:19.220
Okay, I did it.

01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:21.220
I feel a little happy that I did it.

01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:24.220
I guess I have to just go back now.

01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:29.220
Yay, thank you, some pies.

01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:52.220
Huh?

01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:54.220
Huh?

01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:57.220
Did I go this way?

01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:58.220
Oh!

01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:00.220
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:01.220
Wait.

01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:23.220
Oh my gosh!

01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:27.220
My little gimp son spooked me for a second!

01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:39.220
Master, we're in a tight spot.

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:42.220
An ultra tight spot.

01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:44.220
Life is precious.

01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:46.220
And the enemies mean business.

01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:48.220
They're called heaven smile.

01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:51.220
Look at their eyes.

01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:54.220
There's nothing heavenly about them.

01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:56.220
In the name of Harmon.

01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:59.220
Wait, maybe I should go back.

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:01.220
Maybe I should go back and save?

01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:03.220
What do you think?

01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:16.220
Maybe I should go back to the save.

01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:19.220
Yeah.

01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:23.220
Since I'm very new, I just beat that little...

01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:31.220
Yeah.

01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:39.220
Okay.

01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:00.220
Harmon's room?

01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:02.220
Is that the one I need to go to?

01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:03.220
Yes.

01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:08.220
Samantha.

01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:11.220
Okay.

01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:17.220
Let's overwrite this one.

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:19.220
Yes.

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:20.220
We're good.

01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:32.220
Okay, we're good now.

01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:39.220
How's your head feeling so far, Mercy?

01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:40.220
I think it's okay.

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:41.220
Okay.

01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:01.220
I don't know if this game is...

01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:04.220
What do you call it?

01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:06.220
Um...

01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:09.220
If it would be like a game that

01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:12.220
a major company would fund nowadays.

01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.220
But it seems really cool.

01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:17.220
Once you get used to it, I think

01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:20.220
once you get used to the controls, it takes a while, but I get it.

01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:24.220
Huh?

01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:35.220
Ah!

01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:02.220
Hey, I'm not...

01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.220
Okay.

01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:29.220
Any motherfuckers?

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:31.220
Any other motherfuckers here?

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:33.220
Thank you.

01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:39.220
Oh!

01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:40.220
Oh my God!

01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:42.220
I could have just saved up here?

01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:43.220
Wow!

01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:49.220
Jeez, are you...

01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:50.220
She's scared.

01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:51.220
This is the...

01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:53.220
This is the scary, right?

01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:54.220
This is the scary one, right?

01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:56.220
Is she gonna attack me?

01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:04.220
Do I talk to her?

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:06.220
Should I talk to her?

01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:12.220
Okay, well, I'll talk to her.

01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:19.220
Never mind.

01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:21.220
I'm just gonna go to the telly.

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:25.220
Who the hell is this?

01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:33.220
I've changed my makeup.

01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:34.220
Did you notice?

01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:39.220
What did you say?

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:41.220
Later.

01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:42.220
Oh, they're all Smith!

01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:44.220
I just realized they're all Smith.

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:49.220
Okay, we're slowly unlocking them.

01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:51.220
Understood.

01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:03.220
No, okay.

01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:16.220
Is there anything else she has in here?

01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:17.220
No?

01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:25.220
Can I talk to her?

01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:27.220
Or is she just gonna...

01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:31.220
Is she just gonna just, like, stare at me like that?

01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:36.220
Or is she just gonna...

01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:39.220
Oh, shit.

01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:40.220
Oh, shit.

01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:41.220
No!

01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:44.220
Okay.

01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:00.220
I had a moment.

01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:01.220
I'm sorry.

01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:03.220
I forgot how the game worked.

01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:06.220
I'm sorry.

01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:08.220
I forgot how the game worked.

01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:11.220
I forgot how the game worked.

01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:29.220
I forgot how it worked.

01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:41.220
What the heck is that?

01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:56.220
I nearly fucking died!

01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:10.220
Ah!

01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:15.220
What the fuck?

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:28.220
I'm lost now.

01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:33.220
I got lost.

01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:35.220
That was a truck!

01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:40.220
X to pull up map.

01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:44.220
Where am I?

01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:06.220
Holy shit, Travis scared me again!

01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:10.220
Ah!

01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:14.220
Let's talk serious for a second.

01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:18.220
Heaven's smile, they're holy warriors.

01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:20.220
Shit, ain't that pretty wicked?

01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:23.220
Warriors who fight with the holy will on their side

01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:25.220
and use death as a weapon.

01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:26.220
Their target?

01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:29.220
The very dignity of the country itself.

01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:31.220
Well, why should you understand the meaning?

01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:33.220
Shit, you're a killer after all.

01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:40.220
Oh my gosh, he just fucking scared me!

01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:47.220
I guess this means...

01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:53.220
Is green a color I didn't know?

01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:17.220
Hahahaha!

01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:21.220
Come on.

01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:23.220
You gotta help me.

01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:27.220
Ah!

01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:32.220
Bean.

01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:35.220
Oh!

01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:46.220
Who are you?

01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:49.220
Oh, like old times, huh?

01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:51.220
Tell me how's old Smith?

01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:55.220
Things going good with Mills, no?

01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:58.220
That old Smith, not much of a successor.

01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:01.220
But good man, yes.

01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:05.220
Thank you, much gratitude.

01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:08.220
Ready for today's hint?

01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:12.220
I checked the candlesticks.

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:16.220
A strange design indeed is...

01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:18.220
It is hidden there.

01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:21.220
The order is hidden here.

01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:23.220
Want to know more?

01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:26.220
Then use this mask.

01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:28.220
I'll be right back.

01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:30.220
I'll be right back.

01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:32.220
Want to know more?

01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:35.220
Then use this mask.

01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:41.220
Shoot the mask, and the mask will tell you.

01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:45.220
But watch out!

01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:47.220
This mask's lust for blood.

01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:50.220
Thicker blood.

01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:53.220
Demon lust for blood, yes?

01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:56.220
If you're brave, shoot the mask.

01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:58.220
Shoot the mask.

01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:02.220
It'll tell you everything.

01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:07.220
Am I close to a save point?

01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:09.220
Hold on.

01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:12.220
Where am I exactly?

01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:28.220
You're...

01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:31.220
You're in the yellow by the hand icon.

01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:43.220
This map's hard to read.

01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:49.220
You're next to the hand and ring symbol, I think.

01:34:57.220 --> 01:34:59.220
Okay.

01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:03.220
How much further is the save?

01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:10.220
Okay.

01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:12.220
I'm facing south, okay.

01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:17.220
Yeah, I have to...

01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:19.220
I have seen more useful maps in games, I admit.

01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:21.220
Yeah, that's kinda hard.

01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:23.220
So...

01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:26.220
Okay, I'll shoot it.

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:29.220
It's not gonna come attack me, right?

01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:45.220
Is it gonna attack me?

01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:47.220
Okay.

01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:55.220
I've beaten this game a million times.

01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:58.220
I'm so glad I have, I have senpai's,

01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:00.220
seasoned senpai's for this game,

01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:04.220
because I am a little bit confuzzled at times.

01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:06.220
Okay.

01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:16.220
Okay.

01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:18.220
So how do I shoot the mask?

01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:33.220
Just aim like normal, okay.

01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:37.220
Okay.

01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:39.220
With your gun, okay.

01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:42.220
I know with my gun, but I'm like, do I...

01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:44.220
Like...

01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:46.220
Like this?

01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:56.220
Wait.

01:36:57.220 --> 01:36:59.220
Did he just...

01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:02.220
Did he just give me the middle finger?

01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:05.220
So, you are the worthless loser.

01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:07.220
What a pitiful existence.

01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:09.220
I am the true mask.

01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:14.220
And I shall guide you.

01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:18.220
The ring of fire

01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:22.220
and number shown on the candlestick.

01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:25.220
From one to five,

01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:29.220
follow the order and ignite the flames.

01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:32.220
Tomorrow, it could be you.

01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:35.220
Son of a bitch,

01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:38.220
he's just given me the middle finger.

01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:54.220
This one?

01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:01.220
This one?

01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:11.220
Insufficient flame.

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:15.220
Eh?

01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:19.220
I didn't even know there was a room there!

01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:30.220
Shit.

01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:40.220
Sorry.

01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:42.220
At a moment.

01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:44.220
Oops.

01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:47.220
Sorry.

01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:01.220
Please help me.

01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:03.220
It suddenly disappeared.

01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:06.220
A white light flashed before me.

01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:08.220
Everything is transparent.

01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:10.220
I held his hand.

01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:13.220
Whose hand was it?

01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:17.220
Then, before I knew it, I was lost again.

01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:19.220
Please help me.

01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:21.220
I can't see a thing.

01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:30.220
I don't think I finished exploring here.

01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:37.220
What the fuck happened?

01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:39.220
Oops.

01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:43.220
What happened?

01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:46.220
Wait, was that the woman I saw before? Never mind.

01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:48.220
I know what happened.

01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:58.220
I don't remember which way I went.

01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:08.220
It's locked from the other side.

01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:11.220
Okay.

01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:18.220
Power.

01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:41.220
What was that?

01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:46.220
Did I go to here already?

01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:50.220
I feel like I've already been here.

01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:52.220
Yeah, you have.

01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:54.220
I've been here already.

01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.220
Okay.

01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:58.220
Wow, I'm silly, Billy.

01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:00.220
What's that?

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:02.220
What's that?

01:41:02.220 --> 01:41:04.220
Did I go to here already?

01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:08.220
I feel like I've already been here.

01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:10.220
Did I go to here already?

01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:12.220
Yeah, you have.

01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:14.220
I've been here already.

01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:16.220
Okay.

01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:18.220
Wow, I'm silly, Billy.

01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:20.220
I got really confused.

01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:22.220
Sorry.

01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:50.220
Oh, right.

01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:52.220
Travis was here.

01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:54.220
My bad.

01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:56.220
That was the wrong way.

01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:20.220
Okay.

01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:30.220
Okay.

01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:32.220
I'm starting to get it.

01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:44.220
Bro!

01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:46.220
Master!

01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:48.220
We're in a tight spot.

01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:50.220
A major tight spot.

01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:52.220
He's here.

01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:54.220
Yes, him!

01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:56.220
Master, you can't.

01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:00.220
You're going to go and kill him?

01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:04.220
What?

01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:06.220
Impossible.

01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:08.220
You're a fool.

01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:10.220
And you're a go-

01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:12.220
You can't read.

01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:14.220
Impossible. You're sure to fail.

01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:16.220
You know nothing of his strength.

01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:18.220
All stupid, stupid master.

01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:20.220
That mill's really fooled you.

01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:24.220
In the name of the fool.

01:43:30.220 --> 01:43:32.220
Should I...

01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:34.220
Do I have flames?

01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:36.220
Does do...

01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:38.220
Do I have flames?

01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:40.220
Hahaha.

01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:42.220
Nobody has faith in me.

01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:44.220
It's fine.

01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:46.220
I don't even have faith in myself.

01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:02.220
This way?

01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:04.220
Oh, carry your pigeon.

01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:08.220
Give me the pigeon.

01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:12.220
Dear Amir.

01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:14.220
It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance

01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:16.220
and many thanks for choosing me for the job.

01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:18.220
My name is Johnny Gagnan.

01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:20.220
Otherwise known as

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:22.220
Speedster.

01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:24.220
Okay.

01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:26.220
I get excited when I slit a guy's throat.

01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:28.220
I know that may be sick,

01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:30.220
but I do the best work in town.

01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:32.220
This is a report on the job.

01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:34.220
I'm sure you'll like what I have to say.

01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:36.220
I watch them like a hawk.

01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:38.220
So I think a hefty reward is an order.

01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:40.220
There are seven in the Smith's Indian.

01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:42.220
Dear Smith.

01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:44.220
Who uses a large caliber revolver?

01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:46.220
Hi, Dace.

01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:48.220
No, not dear.

01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:50.220
Dan Smith.

01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:52.220
Wow.

01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:54.220
Gagnan, these nuts.

01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:56.220
Shut up!

01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:58.220
Hahaha.

01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:00.220
Feeling a little too relatable to the text?

01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:02.220
Maybe a little bit.

01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:22.220
Who uses a large automatic rifle?

01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:24.220
Okay.

01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:26.220
Hi, Dace Smith.

01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:28.220
Who uses a large automatic rifle?

01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:30.220
Colin Smith.

01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:32.220
Who uses two full auto pistols?

01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:34.220
Masked a Smith.

01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:36.220
Who uses grenades?

01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:38.220
Kevin Smith.

01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:40.220
Who uses knives?

01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:42.220
What are these names?

01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:52.220
Coyote Smith.

01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:54.220
Who uses a modified gun?

01:45:54.220 --> 01:45:56.220
Christian Smith. Who uses a small pistol?

01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:58.220
They are an armed force

01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:00.220
that rivals a small army.

01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:06.220
You wouldn't want to be on their bad side.

01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:08.220
In conclusion, it is in

01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.220
the interest of the United States

01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:12.220
to keep them around.

01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:14.220
There's no telling when they might come in handy.

01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:22.220
Meet the Smiths.

01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:24.220
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:26.220
I'll be contacting you again.

01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:28.220
Johnny Gagnan.

01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:32.220
Oh!

01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:34.220
Obtained career memo.

01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:40.220
I guess I got to turn back then.

01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:48.220
Can I save now?

01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:54.220
Maybe not?

01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:56.220
Maybe not?

01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:06.220
I want to see the telly.

01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:08.220
Don't make me say it again.

01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:10.220
Wait here.

01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:12.220
I've changed my makeup.

01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:14.220
Did you notice?

01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:18.220
Kevin!

01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:20.220
What did you say?

01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:22.220
Later.

01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:24.220
Peace.

01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:30.220
Masked a Smith.

01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:32.220
I can wake them up.

01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:34.220
Can I wake them up, guys?

01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:36.220
Is it in my best interest

01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:38.220
to wake them up?

01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:50.220
Don't make me say it again.

01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:52.220
Wait here.

01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:54.220
I've changed my makeup.

01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:56.220
What did you say?

01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:58.220
Later.

01:47:58.220 --> 01:48:00.220
Masked a Smith.

01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:10.220
Oh!

01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:12.220
He's really wearing a luchador mask.

01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:18.220
Wow.

01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:20.220
Later.

01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:22.220
What about this one? Can I wake this one up?

01:48:22.220 --> 01:48:24.220
Kevin, you're a little bit gangly.

01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:34.220
Why are you so tall?

01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:50.220
Is Kevin any good?

01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:54.220
He's so...

01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:56.220
He's so...

01:48:56.220 --> 01:48:58.220
He's so gangly.

01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:00.220
Later.

01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:02.220
Peace.

01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:04.220
Destiny.

01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:06.220
Did he just say destiny?

01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:10.220
There's 11 channels. Does that mean I have?

01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:16.220
Don't make me say it again.

01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:18.220
Wait here.

01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:20.220
I've changed my makeup.

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:22.220
Wait here.

01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:30.220
What did you say?

01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:32.220
Later.

01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:34.220
Destiny.

01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:36.220
Destiny.

01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:38.220
That's all he said. It was just destiny.

01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:44.220
Are you sure you'll be calling anyone gangly?

01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:48.220
I have the right to insult anyone.

01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:50.220
I have the right to insult anyone.

01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:52.220
Also, it's Killer7, but there's

01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:54.220
11 channels.

01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:00.220
Great serum from Blood by pressing

01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:02.220
the A button.

01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:06.220
Select Personality

01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:08.220
and press the A button.

01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:10.220
Wait here.

01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:12.220
I've changed my makeup. Did you know?

01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:14.220
What did you say?

01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:16.220
Later.

01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:18.220
Peace.

01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:20.220
Who should I go?

01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:22.220
What did you say?

01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:24.220
Later.

01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:26.220
Should there be someone I choose for now?

01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:30.220
I'm letting my senpais

01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:32.220
backseat me right now.

01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:34.220
What did you say?

01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:38.220
I've changed my makeup.

01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:40.220
I've changed my makeup.

01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:42.220
What did you say?

01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:44.220
Destiny.

01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:46.220
Destiny.

01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:48.220
We'll use

01:50:48.220 --> 01:50:50.220
Mask.

01:50:52.220 --> 01:50:54.220
I just like

01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:56.220
teleported in.

01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:58.220
I

01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:02.220
have such bad posture.

01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:14.220
I

01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:28.220
What happened?

01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:30.220
Why did it scan?

01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:32.220
I'm so sorry.

01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:34.220
I don't understand why it didn't scan.

01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:36.220
I

01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:42.220
What the?

01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:44.220
Why didn't it scan?

01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:46.220
At that time.

01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:48.220
No, no, no.

01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:50.220
I pressed the...

01:51:50.220 --> 01:51:52.220
Maybe I didn't hold it down enough.

01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:54.220
That was my bad.

01:51:56.220 --> 01:51:58.220
What the hell?

01:51:58.220 --> 01:52:00.220
I

01:52:02.220 --> 01:52:04.220
Oh my gosh.

01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:26.220
I'm hitting back.

01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:28.220
I gotta use

01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:30.220
Mask

01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:32.220
this way.

01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:46.220
He's so slow.

01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:48.220
Wait, I can change right here?

01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:52.220
How do I change right here?

01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:58.220
I

01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:06.220
What button?

01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:10.220
Oh, I found it.

01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:28.220
Should I use consmith then?

01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:38.220
How do I heal from the screen?

01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:52.220
I have...

01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:54.220
Okay, there's some stuff.

01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:56.220
I have any items?

01:53:56.220 --> 01:53:58.220
Photos.

01:53:58.220 --> 01:54:00.220
Who the heck is this?

01:54:00.220 --> 01:54:02.220
You know, he kind of looks like

01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:04.220
what's his name? The gumshoe guy

01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:06.220
from Ace Attorney.

01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:16.220
I just...

01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:18.220
wall?

01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:20.220
wall?

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:22.220
Blood?

01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:32.220
Oh.

01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:38.220
Okay, I understand.

01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:40.220
I guess I can try.

01:54:40.220 --> 01:54:42.220
Hi, Dave.

01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:44.220
Whoa! You didn't fucking kill him!

01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:46.220
You didn't fucking kill him?

01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:52.220
I feel like I just fucking killed him.

01:54:56.220 --> 01:54:58.220
Wait, did I just

01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:00.220
upskirt her? Hold on.

01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:02.220
If I'm going to use Kaede,

01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:04.220
I have to read about her.

01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:06.220
Hold on.

01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:14.220
Hold on.

01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:24.220
Oops.

01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:26.220
We're in a tight spot, yeah, yeah.

01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:28.220
Sorry, sorry about

01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:30.220
breaking Senpai's ears.

01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:32.220
I know, it rattles

01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:34.220
the cage a little.

01:55:56.220 --> 01:55:58.220
Okay.

01:55:58.220 --> 01:56:00.220
Sorry, I meant

01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:02.220
to go down to Kaede's

01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:04.220
in the night. I had

01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:06.220
my little quick thingies.

01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:08.220
Master!

01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:10.220
We're in a tight spot.

01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:12.220
The skill is extraordinary.

01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:14.220
Barefoot can call

01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:16.220
spirit Mizaru.

01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:18.220
You can break barriers.

01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:20.220
Allowing you to

01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:22.220
explore new areas.

01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:24.220
You can also

01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:26.220
explore new areas.

01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:30.220
Press the Y button to use it.

01:56:30.220 --> 01:56:32.220
In the name of her, Ma.

01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:36.220
Wait.

01:56:54.220 --> 01:56:56.220
Don't make me say it again.

01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:58.220
Wait here.

01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:00.220
I changed my makeup.

01:57:00.220 --> 01:57:02.220
What did you say?

01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:04.220
Coyote Smith.

01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:12.220
Are you super fast?

01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:14.220
Are you super slow?

01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:16.220
The skill is extraordinary.

01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:24.220
If you press 1, 3, 6,

01:57:24.220 --> 01:57:26.220
you can play a swaps personality.

01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:28.220
I'm using a controller.

01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:36.220
I'll check.

01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:38.220
I'll use it for now.

01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:57.420
Why is he holding it upside down?

01:57:57.420 --> 01:57:58.420
Not!

01:57:58.420 --> 01:57:59.420
Not!

01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:07.220

02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:17.540

02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:44.540
Oh!

02:03:55.540 --> 02:03:57.540
Is that all he's used for?

02:03:59.540 --> 02:04:02.540
How'd I level up?

02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:15.540
I have to go in the hallway for this?

02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:26.540
Ooh!

Okay, thank you, senpai!

You're helping me so much!

02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:53.540
In exchange, I'll let you have five minutes of free time in the cage.

02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:57.540
Don't make me say it again.

02:04:57.540 --> 02:04:59.540
I'm a cleaner.

02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:01.540
Wait here.

02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:05.540
Power.

02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:07.540
Hmm.

02:05:08.540 --> 02:05:10.540
What should I put on for Dan?

02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:20.540
Hmm.

02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:29.540
Hmm.

02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:32.540
What's waiver?

02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:40.540
Waiver helps with aim?

02:05:40.540 --> 02:05:41.540
Okay.

02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:44.540
Maybe I'll put someone's aim since I'm bad at it!

02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:50.540
Waiver velvet from fate?

02:05:58.540 --> 02:05:59.540
Hmm.

02:06:05.540 --> 02:06:08.540
Oh wait, what is the waiver from fate?

02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:15.540
I have enough for more, should I put in more?

02:06:17.540 --> 02:06:19.540
I've changed my makeup.

02:06:20.540 --> 02:06:22.540
What did you say?

02:06:23.540 --> 02:06:24.540
Later.

02:06:30.540 --> 02:06:31.540
Destiny.

02:06:42.540 --> 02:06:45.540
Spend as much as you want, you can farm easily, okay.

02:06:49.540 --> 02:06:50.540
Okay!

02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:54.540
Decisions, decisions.

02:06:55.540 --> 02:06:57.540
Don't make me say it again.

02:06:57.540 --> 02:06:59.540
I'm a cleaner.

02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:05.540
Does Garcian have no level up thingies?

02:07:24.540 --> 02:07:35.540
Yeah, whatever, we'll level Dan up a little, but I'm kind of used to him.

02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:49.540
Oh wait, I should probably save.

02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:50.540
I'm so silly.

02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:52.540
What a silly Billy I am.

02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:53.540
Save!

02:07:55.540 --> 02:07:58.540
Samantha, please be kind to me, I'm gonna save!

02:08:23.540 --> 02:08:25.540
Okay, health looks good.

02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:29.540
Uh, these stairs?

02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:36.540
An object.

02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:42.540
Grier?

02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:53.540
Eh?

02:09:03.540 --> 02:09:06.540
Well hello, Smith.

02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:09.540
Looks like a cloudy, cloudy day!

02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:11.540
What is really too bad, sad face?

02:09:11.540 --> 02:09:14.540
Uh, day to hang out in the laundry.

02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:16.540
Great day to use a dryer though.

02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:22.540
But you know, I just love this one.

02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:24.540
I'll never let anybody have it.

02:09:24.540 --> 02:09:25.540
You know why?

02:09:25.540 --> 02:09:27.540
Well you should.

02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:30.540
I love to stay inside.

02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:32.540
You left this behind, didn't you?

02:09:36.540 --> 02:09:37.540
I got it!

02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:39.540
I got it, I got the firing!

02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:45.540
If you finish your business, could you hurry up and leave?

02:09:45.540 --> 02:09:47.540
You're very much in the way.

02:09:47.540 --> 02:09:49.540
Assassins should have better manners.

02:09:52.540 --> 02:09:54.540
Okay, thank you.

02:09:57.540 --> 02:10:00.540
And then I go here, items.

02:10:01.540 --> 02:10:03.540
Like that, right?

02:10:03.540 --> 02:10:05.540
Should I head back now?

02:10:06.540 --> 02:10:08.540
Should I head back now?

02:10:13.540 --> 02:10:14.540
Should I save?

02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:15.540
I'll save again.

02:10:15.540 --> 02:10:18.540
Sorry, I'm saving all the time so I don't forget.

02:10:36.540 --> 02:10:39.540
Wait, should I turn the dryer back on for her?

02:10:39.540 --> 02:10:40.540
Maybe I should.

02:10:40.540 --> 02:10:44.540
Oh my gosh, I'm such a rude, I'm such a rude friend.

02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:53.540
I forgot to turn it off!

02:11:00.540 --> 02:11:02.540
Never mind, I'm leaving.

02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:09.540
Where the fuck did that come from?

02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:15.540
Whatever, luckily I saved.

02:11:35.540 --> 02:11:37.540
What the fuck?

02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:50.540
Hey, my bitches!

02:12:05.540 --> 02:12:07.540
What the fuck?

02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:22.540
Now what?

02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:32.540
What was that?

02:12:35.540 --> 02:12:37.540
What the fuck?

02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:45.540
What fell?

02:12:46.540 --> 02:12:48.540
Where did it fall?

02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:09.540
Laundry, okay, we're heading back to the laundry.

02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:24.540
What is that?

02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:27.540
Odd engraving.

02:13:29.540 --> 02:13:34.540
Wait, now that I have this, should I backtrack to the candles?

02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:37.540
What the fuck?

02:13:41.540 --> 02:13:43.540
It's an odd engraving.

02:13:43.540 --> 02:13:46.540
Yeah, we should do the backtrack.

02:13:46.540 --> 02:13:48.540
Man, what a pain!

02:14:06.540 --> 02:14:08.540
Ha ha ha!

02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:32.540
What was that sound?

02:14:36.540 --> 02:14:38.540
My map?

02:14:38.540 --> 02:14:40.540
My map?

02:15:04.540 --> 02:15:07.540
I'm just gonna take the stairs.

02:15:08.540 --> 02:15:10.540
Ha ha ha!

02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:36.540
Okay, I didn't backtrack too far.

02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:38.540
Handle.

02:15:38.540 --> 02:15:40.540
Air conditioning?

02:15:42.540 --> 02:15:44.540
Oh, come on.

02:15:51.540 --> 02:15:57.540
One, two, three, four, five.

02:15:59.540 --> 02:16:01.540
Oh!

02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:08.540
What's air conditioner?

02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:30.540
Did I need it on or off?

02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:38.540
Oh.

02:16:50.540 --> 02:16:52.540
Oh!

02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:55.540
But I don't need it anymore, right?

02:17:07.540 --> 02:17:09.540
Ha ha ha!

02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:14.540
Wait, which way?

02:17:27.540 --> 02:17:29.540
Oh.

02:17:37.540 --> 02:17:41.540
He's still flipping you off, like a bitch.

02:17:41.540 --> 02:17:43.540
I mean, he should.

02:17:43.540 --> 02:17:46.540
I'm not that great of a person.

02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:49.540
Go back, you forgot the puzzle piece.

02:17:49.540 --> 02:17:51.540
Huh?

02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:17.540
Dogo?

02:18:20.540 --> 02:18:23.540
What shelf? The one in the room?

02:18:28.540 --> 02:18:30.540
Oh, wow!

02:18:33.540 --> 02:18:35.540
Odd engraving.

02:18:49.540 --> 02:18:51.540
Ha ha ha!

02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:10.540
Look at how much of a pro I am now.

02:19:10.540 --> 02:19:13.540
I improved so much, Senpai.

02:19:20.540 --> 02:19:22.540
Oh.

02:19:30.540 --> 02:19:32.540
Oh, there's so many of you.

02:19:50.540 --> 02:19:52.540
Ah!

02:20:05.540 --> 02:20:07.540
Can I do this control panel?

02:20:07.540 --> 02:20:09.540
Oh!

02:20:19.540 --> 02:20:21.540
Oh!

02:20:28.540 --> 02:20:30.540
Sorry, your leg.

02:20:35.540 --> 02:20:37.540
Man!

02:20:45.540 --> 02:20:47.540
That was kind of brutal.

02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:50.540
Warehouse.

02:20:54.540 --> 02:20:56.540
Oh?

02:21:04.540 --> 02:21:06.540
Oh my gosh!

02:21:06.540 --> 02:21:09.540
It was out of you, you scared me again!

02:21:09.540 --> 02:21:11.540
Master!

02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:13.540
We're in a tight spot.

02:21:13.540 --> 02:21:15.540
Mask is for your disc-

02:21:15.540 --> 02:21:17.540
Gizli rack.

02:21:17.540 --> 02:21:19.540
When there's a crack, it's his shul.

02:21:19.540 --> 02:21:21.540
He's filthy powerful.

02:21:21.540 --> 02:21:24.540
No destroy, all of kingdom come.

02:21:24.540 --> 02:21:26.540
And then some.

02:21:27.540 --> 02:21:30.540
He's a liability if you ask me.

02:21:30.540 --> 02:21:32.540
In the name of Harman.

02:21:32.540 --> 02:21:34.540
Oh!

02:21:34.540 --> 02:21:36.540
I get it.

02:21:36.540 --> 02:21:38.540
I get it.

02:21:38.540 --> 02:21:42.540
I'm picking up while you're putting down game.

02:21:43.540 --> 02:21:45.540
I change.

02:21:45.540 --> 02:21:47.540
Mask here.

02:21:54.540 --> 02:21:56.540
I get it.

02:21:56.540 --> 02:21:58.540
I'm so, yeah.

02:21:59.540 --> 02:22:01.540
Now what?

02:22:01.540 --> 02:22:03.540
I just...

02:22:03.540 --> 02:22:05.540
Wait, but like now what?

02:22:13.540 --> 02:22:15.540
Oh!

02:22:33.540 --> 02:22:36.540
What the hell is that?

02:22:43.540 --> 02:22:45.540
Oh!

02:22:52.540 --> 02:22:54.540
Carry a pigeon.

02:22:59.540 --> 02:23:01.540
Dear Amir.

02:23:06.540 --> 02:23:08.540
We have a problem.

02:23:08.540 --> 02:23:11.540
A terrible thing has happened. Pussy!

02:23:12.540 --> 02:23:15.540
My pigeon's name is Pussy!

02:23:33.540 --> 02:23:35.540
Pigeonosee?

02:23:35.540 --> 02:23:37.540
Pigeonosee?

02:23:38.540 --> 02:23:41.540
Who named this?

02:23:41.540 --> 02:23:43.540
Anyways.

02:23:43.540 --> 02:23:46.540
Who named these pigeons?

02:23:46.540 --> 02:23:49.540
Dear Amir. Amir, we have a problem.

02:23:49.540 --> 02:23:51.540
A terrible thing has happened.

02:23:51.540 --> 02:23:53.540
I can hardly believe it.

02:23:53.540 --> 02:23:55.540
But the money is not in my account.

02:23:55.540 --> 02:23:57.540
What the fuck do you mean?

02:24:08.540 --> 02:24:11.540
I need your help. You got my last messages, didn't you?

02:24:11.540 --> 02:24:13.540
I trusted you.

02:24:13.540 --> 02:24:15.540
Now don't let me down. Promise me.

02:24:15.540 --> 02:24:17.540
Wire me the money immediately.

02:24:17.540 --> 02:24:20.540
125 bucks is peanuts, I'm telling you.

02:24:20.540 --> 02:24:24.540
Smith's syndicate operates in strange ways.

02:24:24.540 --> 02:24:27.540
Garcia and Smith manages the other six personas

02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:31.540
and mainly acts as a negotiator for work requests.

02:24:31.540 --> 02:24:35.540
Garcia never eliminates people himself.

02:24:35.540 --> 02:24:37.540
His role is to retrieve the bodies.

02:24:37.540 --> 02:24:39.540
Even if another persona is killed,

02:24:39.540 --> 02:24:44.540
it appears he is able to bring him back to life

02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:46.540
like a wizard, I tell you.

02:24:46.540 --> 02:24:49.540
However, it's my hunch that somebody offstage

02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:52.540
is calling the shots and controlling Garcia.

02:24:52.540 --> 02:24:55.540
There must be a hidden mastermind separate from the active team.

02:24:55.540 --> 02:24:59.540
And it's likely that this mastermind assigns the jobs.

02:24:59.540 --> 02:25:03.540
Garcia is very loyal and he values the organization,

02:25:03.540 --> 02:25:06.540
controls the personas to keep the organization safe.

02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:09.540
He's a middle manager, you see.

02:25:09.540 --> 02:25:12.540
A member switch using the medium of television.

02:25:12.540 --> 02:25:16.540
I have yet to determine what governs the switches.

02:25:16.540 --> 02:25:22.540
Wizard, Shadow Money, Wizard, Shadow, Wizard Money Gang?

02:25:22.540 --> 02:25:28.540
Shadow, Shadow, Shadow, Shadow, Shadow Gang, Gang, Gang, Gang.

02:25:28.540 --> 02:25:35.540
We love casting spells and sh**.

02:25:35.540 --> 02:25:52.540
The Smith Syndicate is composed of one sensible person and six freaks.

02:25:52.540 --> 02:25:56.540
I never seen the personas interact with each other.

02:25:57.540 --> 02:25:59.540
Alright.

02:26:01.540 --> 02:26:05.540
Soon, I expect to unmask the myth behind the strange group.

02:26:05.540 --> 02:26:09.540
I'll be contacting you again, Johnny Guy, Gangman.

02:26:12.540 --> 02:26:14.540
Tane, carry your memo.

02:26:16.540 --> 02:26:18.540
Hold on, let me switch to someone else.

02:26:21.540 --> 02:26:24.540
I like using Dan because he's kind of easier to use.

02:26:27.540 --> 02:26:28.540
Oh!

02:26:43.540 --> 02:26:45.540
Travis, what are you doing here?

02:26:47.540 --> 02:26:50.540
I was the chief's first catch.

02:26:50.540 --> 02:26:52.540
I can still remember.

02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:54.540
The chief's quivering hand.

02:26:54.540 --> 02:26:58.540
The pain went straight up my spine and then back down again.

02:26:58.540 --> 02:27:00.540
Be honest, that should feel good.

02:27:02.540 --> 02:27:06.540
It all happened on the smothering hot night.

02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:12.540
Is that all you're gonna tell me, Travis?

02:27:12.540 --> 02:27:14.540
Is that all you're gonna tell me?

02:27:15.540 --> 02:27:17.540
Okay, I guess.

02:27:24.540 --> 02:27:25.540
Oh.

02:27:46.540 --> 02:27:49.540
Master, we're in a tight spot.

02:27:49.540 --> 02:27:51.540
Like, tighter than tight.

02:27:51.540 --> 02:27:52.540
Uh-oh.

02:27:53.540 --> 02:27:54.540
Uh-oh?

02:27:54.540 --> 02:27:55.540
Real?

02:27:56.540 --> 02:27:59.540
Oh, I have offended my master with foul words,

02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:01.540
but please, you must understand.

02:28:03.540 --> 02:28:06.540
Just thinking about him drives me absolutely mad.

02:28:06.540 --> 02:28:09.540
He fixes the sink to sink this country,

02:28:09.540 --> 02:28:11.540
and so he's sending his unending blah-blah-blah

02:28:11.540 --> 02:28:13.540
with no sign of letting up.

02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:18.540
How many followers does he command?

02:28:19.540 --> 02:28:21.540
Beware of old friends.

02:28:22.540 --> 02:28:24.540
In the name of Harman.

02:28:49.540 --> 02:28:51.540
Can I save?

02:28:51.540 --> 02:28:52.540
Here.

02:28:59.540 --> 02:29:00.540
Here.

02:29:00.540 --> 02:29:02.540
Get my blood.

02:29:03.540 --> 02:29:05.540
Take my blood doctor.

02:29:06.540 --> 02:29:08.540
Blood doctor, blood doctor.

02:29:09.540 --> 02:29:11.540
Take all my blood doctor.

02:29:12.540 --> 02:29:14.540
Wait, I need the TV again, sorry.

02:29:18.540 --> 02:29:20.540
Don't make me say it again.

02:29:20.540 --> 02:29:21.540
I'm a cleaner.

02:29:21.540 --> 02:29:23.540
Wait here.

02:29:24.540 --> 02:29:25.540
I'm gonna...

02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:28.540
improve my skills again.

02:29:41.540 --> 02:29:42.540
Good enough.

02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:43.540
Okay.

02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:52.540
Now we get information here, right?

02:30:12.540 --> 02:30:14.540
Get away!

02:30:14.540 --> 02:30:16.540
What is this thing?

02:30:18.540 --> 02:30:20.540
Why is it exploding?

02:30:26.540 --> 02:30:28.540
Why does it explode like that?

02:30:43.540 --> 02:30:46.540
This is too easy.

02:30:46.540 --> 02:30:47.540
What?

02:31:08.540 --> 02:31:09.540
What?

02:31:09.540 --> 02:31:12.540
Master, we're in a tight spot.

02:31:13.540 --> 02:31:15.540
Watch out for barefoot.

02:31:15.540 --> 02:31:16.540
Kaede.

02:31:16.540 --> 02:31:18.540
I've sensed this presence before.

02:31:18.540 --> 02:31:20.540
My ex-wife, Mizaru, was near.

02:31:20.540 --> 02:31:21.540
What?

02:31:21.540 --> 02:31:23.540
Is now the servant of barefoot.

02:31:25.540 --> 02:31:26.540
What?

02:31:26.540 --> 02:31:28.540
Let my wife serve you through barefoot.

02:31:29.540 --> 02:31:31.540
Use the Y button for a death shower.

02:31:31.540 --> 02:31:33.540
In the name of Harman.

02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:35.540
What a what?

02:31:42.540 --> 02:31:43.540
What?

02:31:52.540 --> 02:31:54.540
This is too easy.

02:32:12.540 --> 02:32:13.540
What?

02:32:26.540 --> 02:32:27.540
Nice.

02:32:37.540 --> 02:32:39.540
Wait, I went the wrong way.

02:32:39.540 --> 02:32:41.540
I'm gonna go this way.

02:32:42.540 --> 02:32:44.540
Death shower, he said.

02:32:46.540 --> 02:32:48.540
What is death shower?

02:32:55.540 --> 02:32:57.540
How'd I use her skill?

02:32:58.540 --> 02:32:59.540
Gotta head out.

02:32:59.540 --> 02:33:00.540
Good luck, Koi.

02:33:00.540 --> 02:33:01.540
Goodbye!

02:33:01.540 --> 02:33:04.540
Sorry, I'm very not paying attention to chat,

02:33:04.540 --> 02:33:06.540
because I'm confused.

02:33:06.540 --> 02:33:07.540
Confused.

02:33:20.540 --> 02:33:22.540
What is this?

02:33:27.540 --> 02:33:29.540
You don't need to aim for this one.

02:33:29.540 --> 02:33:30.540
Just hit Y.

02:33:30.540 --> 02:33:31.540
Oh.

02:33:33.540 --> 02:33:34.540
Oh!

02:33:36.540 --> 02:33:37.540
Oh!

02:33:42.540 --> 02:33:43.540
Oh!

02:33:46.540 --> 02:33:47.540
Oh!

02:33:52.540 --> 02:33:54.540
Let's grab this bullet.

02:34:03.540 --> 02:34:05.540
Oh, I should probably change out.

02:34:06.540 --> 02:34:07.540
Oh!

02:34:31.540 --> 02:34:33.540
It's locked by padlock.

02:34:36.540 --> 02:34:38.540
Guess I can't go there yet.

02:35:00.540 --> 02:35:02.540
Not bad, me.

02:35:06.540 --> 02:35:08.540
Oh, sorry.

02:35:13.540 --> 02:35:15.540
I was like, oh my gosh!

02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:21.540
Oh my gosh!

02:35:23.540 --> 02:35:25.540
Hi, Travis.

02:35:26.540 --> 02:35:27.540
Can you see it?

02:35:27.540 --> 02:35:29.540
No, I can't see it.

02:35:29.540 --> 02:35:30.540
Oh, sorry.

02:35:30.540 --> 02:35:32.540
I was like, oh my gosh!

02:35:32.540 --> 02:35:33.540
Hi, Travis.

02:35:35.540 --> 02:35:36.540
Can you see it?

02:35:36.540 --> 02:35:38.540
Words written in blood.

02:35:40.540 --> 02:35:42.540
Obviously had a point to make.

02:35:44.540 --> 02:35:47.540
But only two letters are written in real blood.

02:35:47.540 --> 02:35:49.540
Rest are fake.

02:35:52.540 --> 02:35:54.540
You need the girl for this one.

02:36:03.540 --> 02:36:05.540
Does someone in my group pick locks?

02:36:05.540 --> 02:36:07.540
I didn't pay attention.

02:36:07.540 --> 02:36:09.540
I didn't pay attention.

02:36:30.540 --> 02:36:33.540
What the hell is she doing with her hands?

02:36:35.540 --> 02:36:36.540
Blood absorbed.

02:36:37.540 --> 02:36:45.540
No, no what? No pussy? No head?

02:37:08.540 --> 02:37:10.540
Well, I'll go back.

02:37:18.540 --> 02:37:21.540
If I have someone, I'll just use them.

02:37:38.540 --> 02:37:41.540
Oh!

02:37:56.540 --> 02:38:00.540
Yay, blood! I think.

02:38:07.540 --> 02:38:13.540
Travis? Huh? L.A.? Can't you see I'm busy?

02:38:13.540 --> 02:38:16.540
You ought to mind your manners.

02:38:19.540 --> 02:38:23.540
You guys are just a pack of losers.

02:38:23.540 --> 02:38:27.540
You don't even know how to make use of your abilities.

02:38:27.540 --> 02:38:32.540
There are traitors in heaven's smile.

02:38:32.540 --> 02:38:36.540
The chief's very own inside guys.

02:38:38.540 --> 02:38:41.540
They have a white body splattered with red paint.

02:38:41.540 --> 02:38:44.540
A reminder of treacherous speed.

02:38:44.540 --> 02:38:46.540
The girl!

02:38:46.540 --> 02:38:49.540
Kite! Funny thing is the splotches look like beautiful red roses.

02:38:49.540 --> 02:38:53.540
If you find a chameleon smile, use your ability.

02:38:53.540 --> 02:38:58.540
Kill one of them and you'll get loaded up. For real, man.

02:39:02.540 --> 02:39:05.540
Oh.

02:39:10.540 --> 02:39:15.540
Important question. Are you having fun, Mercy? Yeah.

02:39:15.540 --> 02:39:18.540
Oops.

02:39:24.540 --> 02:39:27.540
Oopsies.

02:39:27.540 --> 02:39:31.540
I'm going to switch out characters because I'm not used to them yet.

02:39:37.540 --> 02:39:42.540
I'm getting tired. Kind of tired, though. Usually I have lots...

02:39:42.540 --> 02:39:45.540
What?

02:39:52.540 --> 02:39:56.540
Which way did I need to go again? I'm lost!

02:40:02.540 --> 02:40:05.540
Can I go here already?

02:40:05.540 --> 02:40:09.540
Oh, come on.

02:40:21.540 --> 02:40:25.540
I got used to the game so now I feel more comfortable.

02:40:25.540 --> 02:40:29.540
Can I save here?

02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:32.540
Okay.

02:40:32.540 --> 02:40:36.540
I want to just save here, guys.

02:40:36.540 --> 02:40:43.540
And I'll probably end the gameplay here and I'll probably start yapping.

02:40:49.540 --> 02:40:53.540
Probably start yapping.

02:40:53.540 --> 02:40:57.540
That was a lot.

02:40:57.540 --> 02:41:01.540
Ha ha ha ha!

02:41:01.540 --> 02:41:06.540
Yeah, main outfit saves the day!

02:41:06.540 --> 02:41:09.540
Oh!

02:41:19.540 --> 02:41:23.540
Now, how do I get out of here?

02:41:24.540 --> 02:41:29.540
Yes! Like this. I saved, right? I totally did.

02:41:42.540 --> 02:41:45.540
Yatta!

02:41:45.540 --> 02:41:49.540
Right, let's go...

02:41:49.540 --> 02:41:52.540
Over here.

02:41:53.540 --> 02:41:56.540
Okay.

02:41:56.540 --> 02:41:59.540
How was it? How was it, Senpai? Did you like the game?

02:41:59.540 --> 02:42:03.540
I finally... I think I got the hang of it.

02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:07.540
It took a little bit, but I got the hang of it.

02:42:10.540 --> 02:42:14.540
I was really shocked when...

02:42:14.540 --> 02:42:21.540
At the beginning, the beginning was... Oh, hold on. Let me just fix myself a little bit. Let me...

02:42:22.540 --> 02:42:27.540
Actually, maybe I kind of like myself looking like this, right?

02:42:34.540 --> 02:42:41.540
There, I'm bright and beautiful again. You see me in all my glory.

02:42:41.540 --> 02:42:44.540
Senpai!

02:42:44.540 --> 02:42:49.540
You did like the game, though, right? After I chose it for you!

02:42:50.540 --> 02:42:54.540
It's like the lights turned on.

02:42:58.540 --> 02:43:01.540
It was really tough, but I managed to figure it out.

02:43:01.540 --> 02:43:07.540
It only took up to now to actually fully get comfortable with the game.

02:43:10.540 --> 02:43:14.540
It was pretty brutal, not going to lie to you.

02:43:14.540 --> 02:43:18.540
At the beginning, the game...

02:43:18.540 --> 02:43:21.540
I didn't get it.

02:43:21.540 --> 02:43:28.540
That tutorial was pretty bad, and then I only got it when they gave me the info dump tutorial.

02:43:28.540 --> 02:43:32.540
Then I was like, okay, I get it now, I get it now.

02:43:35.540 --> 02:43:38.540
I'm on guard games are really fun, though.

02:43:38.540 --> 02:43:43.540
I really like kind of experimental games, because I...

02:43:43.540 --> 02:43:49.540
I find that kind of like, weirder gameplay...

02:43:49.540 --> 02:43:55.540
makes me more interested in like, what the story's going to tell.

02:44:02.540 --> 02:44:06.540
It was really, it was really...

02:44:06.540 --> 02:44:09.540
The lore is even crazier, for real?

02:44:09.540 --> 02:44:12.540
Okay, I can't wait to try this game again.

02:44:12.540 --> 02:44:16.540
It might be a little bit, but we'll definitely pick this up again.

02:44:16.540 --> 02:44:19.540
This entire week is booked up.

02:44:19.540 --> 02:44:25.540
It's booked up, so we're going to explore a variety of games together.

02:44:25.540 --> 02:44:29.540
Because...

02:44:29.540 --> 02:44:36.540
Well, I just want to showcase each game that I play.

02:44:36.540 --> 02:44:40.540
That I play for my supplies, where I strapped you...

02:44:40.540 --> 02:44:47.540
Strapped you into a chair, just like in Clockwork Orange.

02:44:47.540 --> 02:44:52.540
What was it? The Ludo something technique?

02:44:52.540 --> 02:44:56.540
I forced your eyes open, and only...

02:44:56.540 --> 02:45:02.540
And every once in a while, I put eye drops, so your eyes get moistered.

02:45:02.540 --> 02:45:06.540
Ludovico technique, yeah!

02:45:06.540 --> 02:45:09.540
I'm so glad my supplies are so smart!

02:45:09.540 --> 02:45:11.540
This is why I love you so much.

02:45:17.540 --> 02:45:20.540
Wow, my supplies are really smart!

02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:23.540
You memorize that.

02:45:23.540 --> 02:45:27.540
I'm so proud. Good job.

02:45:28.540 --> 02:45:33.540
That movie was really fun.

02:45:33.540 --> 02:45:35.540
It was really fun.

02:45:41.540 --> 02:45:46.540
I'm hoping tomorrow... Let me check my schedule again.

02:45:46.540 --> 02:45:51.540
I always forget what I scheduled.

02:45:52.540 --> 02:45:56.540
Because I'm kind of clumsy.

02:45:56.540 --> 02:46:03.540
My schedules are weeks in advance.

02:46:03.540 --> 02:46:08.540
So I choose my games weeks in advance.

02:46:11.540 --> 02:46:15.540
Let's see. Tomorrow is Omori.

02:46:15.540 --> 02:46:19.540
In truth, I played Omori before.

02:46:19.540 --> 02:46:21.540
I don't remember much of it.

02:46:21.540 --> 02:46:27.540
I remember rage quitting, because I fought a bunch of bears.

02:46:27.540 --> 02:46:30.540
It was like fighting a bunch of ICs at once.

02:46:30.540 --> 02:46:32.540
It was brutal.

02:46:40.540 --> 02:46:44.540
So that's where...

02:46:44.540 --> 02:46:49.540
Imagine like 10 ICs coming at you.

02:46:49.540 --> 02:46:51.540
Over and over and over and over again.

02:46:51.540 --> 02:46:53.540
It takes you out of breath.

02:46:53.540 --> 02:46:55.540
By the end of it, you're like,

02:46:55.540 --> 02:46:57.540
Okay, I need to go heal up.

02:46:57.540 --> 02:46:59.540
Then you come back.

02:46:59.540 --> 02:47:04.540
They spawn back 10 more bears.

02:47:04.540 --> 02:47:07.540
10 more ICs, okay?

02:47:08.540 --> 02:47:13.540
So I rage quit at that part.

02:47:13.540 --> 02:47:15.540
Now I learned my lesson.

02:47:15.540 --> 02:47:18.540
I'm not going to do that this time.

02:47:18.540 --> 02:47:21.540
Wait, Serenity's in chat?

02:47:21.540 --> 02:47:23.540
Serenity, Serenity, Serenity!

02:47:23.540 --> 02:47:25.540
My baby!

02:47:25.540 --> 02:47:27.540
My baby bunny!

02:47:27.540 --> 02:47:30.540
My bunny bunny, honey!

02:47:30.540 --> 02:47:32.540
Honey!

02:47:36.540 --> 02:47:38.540
I love you!

02:47:38.540 --> 02:47:39.540
The bear fight was rough.

02:47:39.540 --> 02:47:40.540
I found her.

02:47:40.540 --> 02:47:41.540
I found her. Yes, it was.

02:47:41.540 --> 02:47:43.540
It was. I cried.

02:47:46.540 --> 02:47:49.540
I'm so happy you're here.

02:47:51.540 --> 02:47:53.540
I'm so happy you're here.

02:47:54.540 --> 02:47:56.540
Oh, you're kind of up late.

02:48:00.540 --> 02:48:04.540
I'm watching in bed. Have good sleeps then.

02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:07.540
Have good sleeps then.

02:48:09.540 --> 02:48:12.540
Tucks you in. Kisses you goodnight.

02:48:23.540 --> 02:48:25.540
I'm so happy though.

02:48:26.540 --> 02:48:28.540
Oh, I'm so, so happy.

02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:30.540
Thank you Serenity for dropping by.

02:48:30.540 --> 02:48:32.540
I love seeing you here all the time.

02:48:32.540 --> 02:48:33.540
Thank you.

02:48:33.540 --> 02:48:35.540
I'm sure my supplies love you too.

02:48:35.540 --> 02:48:38.540
But yeah, don't try to steal my supplies away from me.

02:48:38.540 --> 02:48:40.540
I will kill you.

02:48:55.540 --> 02:48:57.540
Yeah, yeah!

02:48:57.540 --> 02:48:59.540
Oh my gosh, I love you.

02:49:01.540 --> 02:49:06.540
Yes, Senpai's got five minutes free time and out of the cage

02:49:06.540 --> 02:49:08.540
until they go back again.

02:49:12.540 --> 02:49:16.540
Serenity gets a basement visit permit or is she a resident?

02:49:22.540 --> 02:49:26.540
Well, like she gets special privileges.

02:49:26.540 --> 02:49:30.540
So like she's stuck in the basement, but she gets to go in and out freely.

02:49:30.540 --> 02:49:32.540
Because I trust her.

02:49:38.540 --> 02:49:40.540
Is our cage bedroom size?

02:49:40.540 --> 02:49:42.540
It's dog cage size.

02:49:47.540 --> 02:49:49.540
It's dog cage size.

02:49:49.540 --> 02:49:54.540
It's a little, it's a little um, a little cozy in there.

02:49:54.540 --> 02:49:58.540
I put some star glow in the dark star stickers

02:49:58.540 --> 02:50:03.540
or for my senpais to feel like they're looking up at the night sky.

02:50:06.540 --> 02:50:08.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:50:08.540 --> 02:50:10.540
My senpais get a little doggy bed.

02:50:10.540 --> 02:50:12.540
The plaid ones.

02:50:12.540 --> 02:50:15.540
If you're, if you really get, if you're really feeling special.

02:50:15.540 --> 02:50:20.540
Some, some days you get the velour one, the velour doggy bed.

02:50:21.540 --> 02:50:27.540
With the little pillow and the stuffed animal.

02:50:27.540 --> 02:50:29.540
That's every Fridays.

02:50:29.540 --> 02:50:31.540
That's a treat.

02:50:50.540 --> 02:50:52.540
As a treat. Yeah.

02:50:55.540 --> 02:50:56.540
I'm so generous.

02:50:56.540 --> 02:51:00.540
I know I treat, I'm, I'm such a good girlfriend.

02:51:04.540 --> 02:51:06.540
I'm so happy though.

02:51:08.540 --> 02:51:10.540
I'm such a good girlfriend.

02:51:10.540 --> 02:51:13.540
I let you have all these wonderful treats.

02:51:14.540 --> 02:51:16.540
In fact, I might give you a treat later.

02:51:21.540 --> 02:51:23.540
Yeah.

02:51:26.540 --> 02:51:28.540
Can we get McDonald's?

02:51:31.540 --> 02:51:33.540
Everyone gets a happy meal.

02:51:33.540 --> 02:51:35.540
Once a month.

02:51:44.540 --> 02:51:45.540
The basement.

02:51:45.540 --> 02:51:47.540
Everyone gets a happy meal.

02:51:47.540 --> 02:51:48.540
Once a month.

02:51:48.540 --> 02:51:50.540
You get a little toy to play with.

02:51:52.540 --> 02:51:53.540
Can I have new clothes?

02:51:53.540 --> 02:51:54.540
No.

02:51:59.540 --> 02:52:01.540
Is that a little unhealthy at the McDonald's?

02:52:01.540 --> 02:52:03.540
Well, it is a treat.

02:52:03.540 --> 02:52:05.540
That's why it's a treat only once a month.

02:52:09.540 --> 02:52:10.540
Yeah, everyone shares.

02:52:10.540 --> 02:52:12.540
You got, everyone has to share.

02:52:12.540 --> 02:52:13.540
Okay.

02:52:13.540 --> 02:52:17.540
Everyone gets one little, little, little, little taste of the yogurt.

02:52:18.540 --> 02:52:24.540
Everyone gets a tiny, tiny crumb of, of the fries.

02:52:26.540 --> 02:52:31.540
And then have a little, little, little fight over the nuggets.

02:52:40.540 --> 02:52:42.540
And the toy is shared amongst everyone.

02:52:42.540 --> 02:52:43.540
Of course.

02:52:49.540 --> 02:52:51.540
Can we not fight over it?

02:52:53.540 --> 02:52:56.540
Well, if you, you're all good and willing to share,

02:52:56.540 --> 02:52:58.540
you don't have to fight over it.

02:52:59.540 --> 02:53:01.540
After all, it's a democracy here.

02:53:14.540 --> 02:53:16.540
Kai won't be our toy?

02:53:16.540 --> 02:53:17.540
Of course not.

02:53:17.540 --> 02:53:19.540
You're my toy Senpai.

02:53:36.540 --> 02:53:38.540
Can we vote for more time?

02:53:38.540 --> 02:53:39.540
Yeah.

02:53:39.540 --> 02:53:41.540
Democracy where, um,

02:53:42.540 --> 02:53:46.540
Mercy's, Mercy's vote is worth 10 times more

02:53:46.540 --> 02:53:49.540
than everyone else's combined.

02:54:00.540 --> 02:54:02.540
I vote for last free time.

02:54:02.540 --> 02:54:03.540
Oh.

02:54:04.540 --> 02:54:05.540
Okay.

02:54:05.540 --> 02:54:07.540
So last free time, that means you,

02:54:07.540 --> 02:54:09.540
I can assign homework now.

02:54:12.540 --> 02:54:13.540
Okay.

02:54:29.540 --> 02:54:32.540
I can give Senpai's homework.

02:54:32.540 --> 02:54:34.540
It's really easy.

02:54:34.540 --> 02:54:35.540
It's really easy homework.

02:54:35.540 --> 02:54:36.540
You'll love it.

02:54:36.540 --> 02:54:38.540
You'll love it.

02:54:38.540 --> 02:54:42.540
Watch every single episode of Cardcaptor Sakura.

02:54:51.540 --> 02:54:54.540
Watch every single episode of Cardcaptor Sakura.

02:54:54.540 --> 02:54:57.540
Come back with me with a thousand word,

02:54:57.540 --> 02:55:01.540
a little essay about how you felt about it.

02:55:02.540 --> 02:55:04.540
And then,

02:55:04.540 --> 02:55:06.540
mostly your thousand word essay

02:55:06.540 --> 02:55:09.540
must consist of why Sakura is the best

02:55:12.540 --> 02:55:14.540
of about the movies.

02:55:14.540 --> 02:55:15.540
They count.

02:55:15.540 --> 02:55:17.540
It's just one long episode.

02:55:23.540 --> 02:55:25.540
1,200 words?

02:55:25.540 --> 02:55:28.540
Oh, you get bonus points then.

02:55:28.540 --> 02:55:30.540
Your bonus point will be a little,

02:55:30.540 --> 02:55:32.540
a little smooch.

02:55:32.540 --> 02:55:34.540
A little smooch on your homework.

02:55:38.540 --> 02:55:40.540
Can it be a group project instead?

02:55:40.540 --> 02:55:41.540
No.

02:55:44.540 --> 02:55:46.540
I can't call Sakura the best because you're the best.

02:55:46.540 --> 02:55:48.540
Of course I'm the best.

02:55:48.540 --> 02:55:50.540
But at the same time, we must,

02:55:50.540 --> 02:55:52.540
if it wasn't for Sakura,

02:55:52.540 --> 02:55:54.540
I wouldn't even be here.

02:55:54.540 --> 02:55:56.540
Sakura actually,

02:55:56.540 --> 02:55:58.540
got me through hard times.

02:56:08.540 --> 02:56:10.540
The original, right?

02:56:10.540 --> 02:56:13.540
Or will you do the Nirvana butchered version too?

02:56:13.540 --> 02:56:14.540
Both.

02:56:16.540 --> 02:56:17.540
Both.

02:56:17.540 --> 02:56:20.540
When I said all episodes, I meant it in every single language.

02:56:27.540 --> 02:56:28.540
Hahaha.

02:56:33.540 --> 02:56:34.540
Instructions unclear.

02:56:34.540 --> 02:56:35.540
Binge Chobits.

02:56:35.540 --> 02:56:37.540
Oh, speaking of Chobits,

02:56:37.540 --> 02:56:39.540
I just remember,

02:56:39.540 --> 02:56:42.540
when I was a child,

02:56:42.540 --> 02:56:44.540
I loved Chobits.

02:56:44.540 --> 02:56:46.540
And I,

02:56:46.540 --> 02:56:49.540
had no idea what Chobits was about.

02:56:49.540 --> 02:56:51.540
So when you know,

02:56:51.540 --> 02:56:53.540
little old,

02:56:53.540 --> 02:56:55.540
baby Mercy went,

02:56:55.540 --> 02:56:58.540
why is it such a big deal that,

02:56:58.540 --> 02:56:59.540
there's a button there?

02:56:59.540 --> 02:57:00.540
Of course there's a button there.

02:57:00.540 --> 02:57:02.540
That's the last place I didn't look.

02:57:05.540 --> 02:57:07.540
I had no idea.

02:57:12.540 --> 02:57:14.540
I had no idea.

02:57:14.540 --> 02:57:15.540
Every time,

02:57:15.540 --> 02:57:16.540
the entire time,

02:57:16.540 --> 02:57:17.540
I was like, wow,

02:57:17.540 --> 02:57:18.540
she is so cute.

02:57:18.540 --> 02:57:20.540
I hope she's so happy with Hideki.

02:57:21.540 --> 02:57:24.540
And then I watched it,

02:57:24.540 --> 02:57:26.540
re-watched it again,

02:57:26.540 --> 02:57:27.540
and I was like,

02:57:27.540 --> 02:57:29.540
I shouldn't have watched this.

02:57:29.540 --> 02:57:31.540
Why did I watch this?

02:57:31.540 --> 02:57:32.540
I shouldn't have watched this

02:57:32.540 --> 02:57:34.540
when I was a wee little lass.

02:57:40.540 --> 02:57:41.540
I was,

02:57:41.540 --> 02:57:43.540
yeah,

02:57:43.540 --> 02:57:45.540
I didn't tell this one,

02:57:45.540 --> 02:57:48.540
but I don't think it's a really cringe story,

02:57:48.540 --> 02:57:49.540
but,

02:57:49.540 --> 02:57:50.540
I guess there's a lot of things

02:57:50.540 --> 02:57:51.540
when I didn't,

02:57:51.540 --> 02:57:53.540
I was very ignorant of,

02:57:53.540 --> 02:57:55.540
more so than now.

02:57:57.540 --> 02:57:58.540
For example,

02:57:58.540 --> 02:58:01.540
I used to call every single person,

02:58:01.540 --> 02:58:03.540
who was like,

02:58:03.540 --> 02:58:06.540
a female caretaker of me,

02:58:06.540 --> 02:58:07.540
for example, like,

02:58:07.540 --> 02:58:09.540
a mommy, right?

02:58:09.540 --> 02:58:11.540
So I would call my teacher's mommy,

02:58:11.540 --> 02:58:12.540
I would call,

02:58:14.540 --> 02:58:16.540
I would call my friends,

02:58:16.540 --> 02:58:18.540
my friends,

02:58:18.540 --> 02:58:20.540
mom, mommy as well,

02:58:20.540 --> 02:58:22.540
because I thought,

02:58:22.540 --> 02:58:23.540
because I read in a book,

02:58:23.540 --> 02:58:24.540
it says like,

02:58:24.540 --> 02:58:26.540
oh, what is a mommy?

02:58:26.540 --> 02:58:27.540
What is a mother?

02:58:27.540 --> 02:58:28.540
A mommy is,

02:58:28.540 --> 02:58:31.540
is someone who takes care of you.

02:58:31.540 --> 02:58:32.540
So I just associated it

02:58:32.540 --> 02:58:33.540
for a long time,

02:58:33.540 --> 02:58:35.540
with just like,

02:58:35.540 --> 02:58:38.540
just like any woman who took care of me.

02:58:41.540 --> 02:58:42.540
And then I think,

02:58:42.540 --> 02:58:44.540
I only found out when I got like,

02:58:44.540 --> 02:58:45.540
really,

02:58:45.540 --> 02:58:46.540
I got lectured about it,

02:58:46.540 --> 02:58:47.540
by a teacher who did not,

02:58:47.540 --> 02:58:49.540
like being called mommy.

02:58:56.540 --> 02:58:57.540
He called friends,

02:58:57.540 --> 02:58:59.540
now I called my friends,

02:58:59.540 --> 02:59:00.540
mom,

02:59:00.540 --> 02:59:01.540
this as well,

02:59:01.540 --> 02:59:02.540
so I would call mommy,

02:59:02.540 --> 02:59:04.540
their mommy, mommy.

02:59:05.540 --> 02:59:07.540
Oh my gosh, Strony!

02:59:09.540 --> 02:59:11.540
Strony calls.

02:59:12.540 --> 02:59:14.540
Welcome,

02:59:14.540 --> 02:59:15.540
mommy!

02:59:17.540 --> 02:59:18.540
Mommy!

02:59:20.540 --> 02:59:22.540
Speaking of mommies,

02:59:22.540 --> 02:59:24.540
mommies here, everybody,

02:59:24.540 --> 02:59:27.540
everyone bow your head in respect,

02:59:27.540 --> 02:59:28.540
every Senpai,

02:59:28.540 --> 02:59:30.540
bow your head in respect.

02:59:33.540 --> 02:59:35.540
Are you doing it Senpai?

02:59:35.540 --> 02:59:36.540
Good,

02:59:36.540 --> 02:59:37.540
mommy is off to brush her teeth,

02:59:37.540 --> 02:59:38.540
and go to sleep.

02:59:38.540 --> 02:59:39.540
Good, good, good,

02:59:39.540 --> 02:59:41.540
make sure to floss as well.

02:59:42.540 --> 02:59:43.540
Welcome everyone,

02:59:43.540 --> 02:59:45.540
welcome to the stream,

02:59:45.540 --> 02:59:47.540
I just finished,

02:59:47.540 --> 02:59:49.540
not finished, but I,

02:59:50.540 --> 02:59:51.540
I just,

02:59:52.540 --> 02:59:53.540
temporarily,

02:59:53.540 --> 02:59:54.540
put on hold,

02:59:54.540 --> 02:59:56.540
my playthrough of

02:59:56.540 --> 02:59:57.540
Killer Seven,

02:59:58.540 --> 02:59:59.540
in order to yap.

03:00:01.540 --> 03:00:02.540
Have fun Mercy,

03:00:02.540 --> 03:00:03.540
love you,

03:00:03.540 --> 03:00:04.540
love you too,

03:00:04.540 --> 03:00:05.540
mommy!

03:00:05.540 --> 03:00:06.540
I love you!

03:00:12.540 --> 03:00:13.540
Of course,

03:00:13.540 --> 03:00:14.540
Strony has like,

03:00:14.540 --> 03:00:15.540
super strong endurance.

03:00:15.540 --> 03:00:16.540
I,

03:00:17.540 --> 03:00:19.540
am still getting used to my schedule,

03:00:19.540 --> 03:00:21.540
so my endurance is not as,

03:00:21.540 --> 03:00:22.540
as good.

03:00:22.540 --> 03:00:23.540
My endurance,

03:00:23.540 --> 03:00:25.540
maximum for me,

03:00:25.540 --> 03:00:26.540
I can do,

03:00:26.540 --> 03:00:29.540
if I'm really enthralled by a game,

03:00:29.540 --> 03:00:30.540
is,

03:00:31.540 --> 03:00:33.540
the max I did was,

03:00:33.540 --> 03:00:35.540
I think I did 12 hours with the max,

03:00:35.540 --> 03:00:36.540
and then,

03:00:36.540 --> 03:00:37.540
like,

03:00:37.540 --> 03:00:38.540
after that I was like,

03:00:38.540 --> 03:00:39.540
I'm never doing that again,

03:00:39.540 --> 03:00:40.540
so my max,

03:00:40.540 --> 03:00:41.540
absolute limit,

03:00:41.540 --> 03:00:43.540
is probably 8 hours.

03:00:44.540 --> 03:00:46.540
Probably 8 hours.

03:00:47.540 --> 03:00:48.540
Killer Seven,

03:00:48.540 --> 03:00:49.540
good taste,

03:00:49.540 --> 03:00:50.540
thank you,

03:00:50.540 --> 03:00:51.540
actually,

03:00:51.540 --> 03:00:52.540
I thought I played Killer Seven,

03:00:52.540 --> 03:00:53.540
I was like,

03:00:53.540 --> 03:00:54.540
yeah, I played Killer Seven,

03:00:54.540 --> 03:00:55.540
like,

03:00:55.540 --> 03:00:56.540
that's not a 51 game,

03:00:56.540 --> 03:00:57.540
right?

03:00:57.540 --> 03:00:58.540
Yeah, I played it before,

03:00:58.540 --> 03:00:59.540
turns out I played,

03:00:59.540 --> 03:01:00.540
Killer is dead,

03:01:00.540 --> 03:01:01.540
and that's a completely different game,

03:01:01.540 --> 03:01:02.540
so, oops.

03:01:02.540 --> 03:01:03.540
Hahaha.

03:01:08.540 --> 03:01:11.540
What's the normal gaming session length for you?

03:01:11.540 --> 03:01:12.540
Mmm,

03:01:12.540 --> 03:01:14.540
I'd say about,

03:01:14.540 --> 03:01:15.540
2 to 3 hours.

03:01:16.540 --> 03:01:18.540
That's normally what normal is,

03:01:18.540 --> 03:01:20.540
unless I'm super enthralled by it,

03:01:20.540 --> 03:01:21.540
but, um,

03:01:21.540 --> 03:01:23.540
since I,

03:01:23.540 --> 03:01:25.540
get a little,

03:01:25.540 --> 03:01:27.540
I'm a little bit,

03:01:27.540 --> 03:01:30.540
not used to the schedule yet,

03:01:30.540 --> 03:01:33.540
and not used to my new routine yet,

03:01:33.540 --> 03:01:34.540
I'm,

03:01:34.540 --> 03:01:36.540
I'm forcing myself to stop,

03:01:36.540 --> 03:01:38.540
within like,

03:01:38.540 --> 03:01:40.540
max 4 hours.

03:01:40.540 --> 03:01:41.540
Hahaha.

03:01:43.540 --> 03:01:45.540
Mostly because,

03:01:45.540 --> 03:01:46.540
um,

03:01:48.540 --> 03:01:49.540
I have things to do,

03:01:49.540 --> 03:01:50.540
and I want to prepare

03:01:50.540 --> 03:01:51.540
a lot of things for Senpai.

03:01:54.540 --> 03:01:56.540
So I want to be in the best condition for Senpai,

03:01:56.540 --> 03:01:57.540
because after like,

03:01:57.540 --> 03:01:59.540
maybe the 2 hour mark,

03:01:59.540 --> 03:02:00.540
it's kind of,

03:02:00.540 --> 03:02:01.540
it's down,

03:02:01.540 --> 03:02:03.540
it's downhill from there,

03:02:03.540 --> 03:02:04.540
it's just like,

03:02:04.540 --> 03:02:05.540
oh my god.

03:02:05.540 --> 03:02:07.540
It's zombie mode,

03:02:07.540 --> 03:02:08.540
or flow mode,

03:02:08.540 --> 03:02:09.540
flow state,

03:02:09.540 --> 03:02:11.540
where I'm not even interacting with chat,

03:02:11.540 --> 03:02:12.540
or,

03:02:12.540 --> 03:02:13.540
you just hear me scream a lot.

03:02:20.540 --> 03:02:21.540
You did pick the,

03:02:21.540 --> 03:02:22.540
pick the game,

03:02:22.540 --> 03:02:23.540
pick up the game,

03:02:23.540 --> 03:02:24.540
surprisingly fast.

03:02:24.540 --> 03:02:25.540
Well, really?

03:02:25.540 --> 03:02:26.540
Is that,

03:02:26.540 --> 03:02:27.540
surprisingly fast?

03:02:27.540 --> 03:02:28.540
I just read.

03:02:28.540 --> 03:02:29.540
I read the instructions,

03:02:29.540 --> 03:02:30.540
I'm like,

03:02:30.540 --> 03:02:31.540
oh god,

03:02:31.540 --> 03:02:32.540
oh god.

03:02:39.540 --> 03:02:41.540
I called that disconnect progression.

03:02:41.540 --> 03:02:42.540
Oh,

03:02:42.540 --> 03:02:43.540
that's a good name for it.

03:02:43.540 --> 03:02:44.540
Thank you,

03:02:44.540 --> 03:02:45.540
Senpai.

03:02:46.540 --> 03:02:47.540
So,

03:02:47.540 --> 03:02:48.540
that's why I was like,

03:02:48.540 --> 03:02:49.540
oh,

03:02:49.540 --> 03:02:50.540
I should probably stop now,

03:02:50.540 --> 03:02:52.540
especially since I'm getting a little bit tired

03:02:52.540 --> 03:02:53.540
and fatigued.

03:02:53.540 --> 03:02:54.540
I think

03:02:54.540 --> 03:02:55.540
part of it is due,

03:02:55.540 --> 03:02:56.540
is due to,

03:02:57.540 --> 03:02:58.540
the motion sickness,

03:02:59.540 --> 03:03:00.540
the,

03:03:00.540 --> 03:03:02.540
probably the medication wearing off as well.

03:03:02.540 --> 03:03:04.540
I did take nausea,

03:03:04.540 --> 03:03:05.540
nausea,

03:03:06.540 --> 03:03:07.540
meds,

03:03:07.540 --> 03:03:08.540
because,

03:03:09.540 --> 03:03:11.540
I am training myself a bit

03:03:11.540 --> 03:03:13.540
with Killer Seven to,

03:03:14.540 --> 03:03:15.540
to,

03:03:16.540 --> 03:03:17.540
get used

03:03:18.540 --> 03:03:19.540
to,

03:03:19.540 --> 03:03:20.540
to motion.

03:03:22.540 --> 03:03:23.540
So,

03:03:23.540 --> 03:03:24.540
some of those are,

03:03:24.540 --> 03:03:26.540
it's probably because,

03:03:26.540 --> 03:03:28.540
it's probably I'm,

03:03:28.540 --> 03:03:29.540
because of that.

03:03:29.540 --> 03:03:31.540
That's my theory.

03:03:31.540 --> 03:03:32.540
And that's,

03:03:32.540 --> 03:03:33.540
just a game.

03:03:38.540 --> 03:03:39.540
So yeah, I was,

03:03:39.540 --> 03:03:40.540
I thought to myself like,

03:03:40.540 --> 03:03:41.540
oh, well,

03:03:41.540 --> 03:03:42.540
I'll just use,

03:03:42.540 --> 03:03:43.540
Killer Seven,

03:03:43.540 --> 03:03:46.540
and I'll probably try other games too.

03:03:46.540 --> 03:03:47.540
Like,

03:03:47.540 --> 03:03:48.540
maybe GoldenEye,

03:03:48.540 --> 03:03:49.540
to,

03:03:49.540 --> 03:03:50.540
to train myself to,

03:03:50.540 --> 03:03:52.540
to get used to,

03:03:53.540 --> 03:03:54.540
first person stuff.

03:03:56.540 --> 03:03:58.540
Do you feel less nervous tomorrow?

03:04:00.540 --> 03:04:01.540
No.

03:04:01.540 --> 03:04:02.540
Probably this entire week,

03:04:02.540 --> 03:04:03.540
I'm going to be a little bit of a,

03:04:03.540 --> 03:04:04.540
of a nerve ball.

03:04:07.540 --> 03:04:08.540
I'm going to probably be,

03:04:08.540 --> 03:04:09.540
a bit of a nerve ball,

03:04:09.540 --> 03:04:10.540
the entire,

03:04:11.540 --> 03:04:12.540
the entire time.

03:04:14.540 --> 03:04:15.540
I might not show it out,

03:04:15.540 --> 03:04:16.540
but inside,

03:04:16.540 --> 03:04:17.540
I'm definitely like,

03:04:18.540 --> 03:04:19.540
I have so many,

03:04:19.540 --> 03:04:21.540
I have so many senpais now,

03:04:21.540 --> 03:04:22.540
what do I do?

03:04:26.540 --> 03:04:27.540
But I definitely want to,

03:04:27.540 --> 03:04:28.540
to play games.

03:04:28.540 --> 03:04:30.540
I'm actually looking forward,

03:04:30.540 --> 03:04:33.540
I think the game that I'm looking forward to the most,

03:04:33.540 --> 03:04:34.540
this week,

03:04:35.540 --> 03:04:36.540
is,

03:04:38.540 --> 03:04:39.540
is Harvester.

03:04:40.540 --> 03:04:42.540
Because I love point and click games.

03:04:43.540 --> 03:04:45.540
I love point and click games.

03:04:49.540 --> 03:04:51.540
Point and click games really,

03:04:51.540 --> 03:04:52.540
really make me happy.

03:04:54.540 --> 03:04:55.540
I'll tell you,

03:04:55.540 --> 03:04:56.540
I'll tell you all a secret, okay?

03:04:56.540 --> 03:04:57.540
Strawny says,

03:04:57.540 --> 03:04:59.540
I should, I should,

03:04:59.540 --> 03:05:00.540
Strawny said,

03:05:00.540 --> 03:05:01.540
I should,

03:05:03.540 --> 03:05:05.540
play more games than point and clicks.

03:05:14.540 --> 03:05:16.540
Do you like transgressive point and click games?

03:05:16.540 --> 03:05:18.540
What do you mean by that?

03:05:20.540 --> 03:05:23.540
Have you tried tell tales in The Walking Dead?

03:05:23.540 --> 03:05:24.540
Not really.

03:05:25.540 --> 03:05:28.540
I've tried the wolf among us.

03:05:31.540 --> 03:05:33.540
Wolf, the wolf one,

03:05:33.540 --> 03:05:35.540
I can't remember what it's really called.

03:05:44.540 --> 03:05:45.540
No, not,

03:05:45.540 --> 03:05:46.540
not among us, right?

03:05:46.540 --> 03:05:47.540
Anyway,

03:05:47.540 --> 03:05:49.540
wasn't among us?

03:05:53.540 --> 03:05:54.540
Wait, what?

03:05:55.540 --> 03:05:57.540
Was it, is it not called that?

03:05:59.540 --> 03:06:00.540
It is called wolf among us.

03:06:00.540 --> 03:06:01.540
Oh my gosh.

03:06:01.540 --> 03:06:02.540
Oh, brain rot.

03:06:02.540 --> 03:06:03.540
I was like, oh, shh.

03:06:08.540 --> 03:06:09.540
Wow.

03:06:11.540 --> 03:06:12.540
Brain rot,

03:06:12.540 --> 03:06:14.540
every time I say among us,

03:06:14.540 --> 03:06:15.540
among us.

03:06:18.540 --> 03:06:19.540
I don't like,

03:06:20.540 --> 03:06:21.540
I don't like

03:06:24.540 --> 03:06:25.540
quick time events.

03:06:25.540 --> 03:06:27.540
That's why I didn't really like that game,

03:06:27.540 --> 03:06:28.540
because I didn't like,

03:06:32.540 --> 03:06:33.540
I didn't like

03:06:34.540 --> 03:06:35.540
quick time events.

03:06:37.540 --> 03:06:39.540
I'm still getting used to,

03:06:39.540 --> 03:06:42.540
getting used to different formats of things,

03:06:42.540 --> 03:06:44.540
because when I do quick time events,

03:06:44.540 --> 03:06:45.540
I have to look down

03:06:45.540 --> 03:06:47.540
because I'm like, what is the button?

03:06:47.540 --> 03:06:49.540
I don't remember which button it is.

03:06:51.540 --> 03:06:53.540
What point click titles are under your belt already?

03:06:53.540 --> 03:06:54.540
Any classics?

03:07:06.540 --> 03:07:08.540
Let me sort out my games.

03:07:09.540 --> 03:07:11.540
Let me sort out my games some pie.

03:07:16.540 --> 03:07:17.540
Oh my gosh,

03:07:17.540 --> 03:07:20.540
how many games do I have in this collection?

03:07:27.540 --> 03:07:31.540
I have 118 point and click games

03:07:31.540 --> 03:07:33.540
on my Steam library.

03:07:36.540 --> 03:07:38.540
Most of it I've already played.

03:07:39.540 --> 03:07:40.540
Let's see.

03:07:46.540 --> 03:07:47.540
I play

03:07:51.540 --> 03:07:52.540
a lot.

03:07:54.540 --> 03:07:55.540
A lot of them.

03:07:56.540 --> 03:07:58.540
Wait, some of these aren't point and clicks.

03:07:59.540 --> 03:08:00.540
Never mind.

03:08:01.540 --> 03:08:03.540
Good chunk of them are, though.

03:08:04.540 --> 03:08:06.540
The last one I played point and click,

03:08:06.540 --> 03:08:07.540
I think,

03:08:08.540 --> 03:08:10.540
was Gabriel Knight.

03:08:12.540 --> 03:08:13.540
Both,

03:08:14.540 --> 03:08:15.540
Gabriel Knight.

03:08:17.540 --> 03:08:19.540
Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel Knight.

03:08:19.540 --> 03:08:20.540
Which one did I play?

03:08:24.540 --> 03:08:25.540
The first one,

03:08:26.540 --> 03:08:28.540
and then Sins of the Father.

03:08:30.540 --> 03:08:31.540
And then

03:08:35.540 --> 03:08:37.540
then I played almost all of them,

03:08:37.540 --> 03:08:38.540
all of the ones,

03:08:38.540 --> 03:08:41.540
almost all of the ones from Watch It Eye.

03:08:44.540 --> 03:08:45.540
Uh...

03:08:51.540 --> 03:08:52.540
Oh yeah, I remember.

03:08:52.540 --> 03:08:54.540
Another one I really loved.

03:08:54.540 --> 03:08:55.540
One that I really liked

03:08:55.540 --> 03:08:57.540
that I thought was really good

03:08:57.540 --> 03:08:59.540
was the Titanic point and click

03:08:59.540 --> 03:09:00.540
adventure out of time.

03:09:00.540 --> 03:09:01.540
That one was really fun.

03:09:03.540 --> 03:09:04.540
What else do I have?

03:09:04.540 --> 03:09:05.540
Tango Tower.

03:09:09.540 --> 03:09:11.540
Oh wait, no, the last one I played

03:09:11.540 --> 03:09:13.540
was not, no, wait, it was Gabriel Knight.

03:09:13.540 --> 03:09:14.540
Sorry.

03:09:14.540 --> 03:09:15.540
Things are, the one before that

03:09:15.540 --> 03:09:17.540
I played was Sanitarium.

03:09:19.540 --> 03:09:20.540
Was Sanitarium.

03:09:21.540 --> 03:09:22.540
And then the one before that

03:09:22.540 --> 03:09:24.540
I think was Salmon Max hit the road.

03:09:32.540 --> 03:09:34.540
And then I played,

03:09:34.540 --> 03:09:35.540
I played a lot.

03:09:35.540 --> 03:09:36.540
I played a lot.

03:09:39.540 --> 03:09:40.540
I played a lot.

03:09:40.540 --> 03:09:42.540
I wrote on my debut,

03:09:42.540 --> 03:09:45.540
I really liked the Blackwell series as well.

03:09:45.540 --> 03:09:47.540
That's also from Watch It Eye.

03:09:49.540 --> 03:09:51.540
Yeah, I played, I played a lot.

03:09:51.540 --> 03:09:52.540
I played a lot.

03:09:52.540 --> 03:09:53.540
Oh yeah, I played

03:09:55.540 --> 03:09:56.540
the 8-bit game,

03:09:56.540 --> 03:09:57.540
the 8-bit anthology.

03:09:58.540 --> 03:09:59.540
So I finished that one.

03:09:59.540 --> 03:10:00.540
It wasn't too bad actually.

03:10:00.540 --> 03:10:01.540
I thought it would be harder.

03:10:05.540 --> 03:10:06.540
And

03:10:08.540 --> 03:10:09.540
yeah.

03:10:11.540 --> 03:10:12.540
I played quite a bit.

03:10:12.540 --> 03:10:14.540
I played a little bit of Disco Legion,

03:10:14.540 --> 03:10:16.540
but I totally forgot about it.

03:10:16.540 --> 03:10:18.540
Because it's, it's, it's...

03:10:21.540 --> 03:10:24.540
It's a game where I need time to play.

03:10:28.540 --> 03:10:29.540
Any LucasArp?

03:10:29.540 --> 03:10:30.540
Monkey Island?

03:10:30.540 --> 03:10:31.540
Yeah, I played Monkey Island.

03:10:31.540 --> 03:10:33.540
I think I have Monkey Island.

03:10:34.540 --> 03:10:35.540
I played one and two.

03:10:36.540 --> 03:10:37.540
I played one and two.

03:10:41.540 --> 03:10:42.540
I played one and two.

03:10:42.540 --> 03:10:45.540
I played the Rusty Lake series as well.

03:10:48.540 --> 03:10:49.540
I played Shadowgate.

03:10:49.540 --> 03:10:50.540
Yeah, I played Shadowgate.

03:10:55.540 --> 03:10:56.540
I played a lot.

03:10:57.540 --> 03:10:58.540
I played a lot.

03:11:02.540 --> 03:11:03.540
So I really like,

03:11:04.540 --> 03:11:06.540
yeah, I like point and click games.

03:11:06.540 --> 03:11:07.540
It's probably my favorite.

03:11:10.540 --> 03:11:11.540
Because

03:11:13.540 --> 03:11:15.540
have you played I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream?

03:11:15.540 --> 03:11:16.540
Yes, I have.

03:11:16.540 --> 03:11:17.540
I also read the short story.

03:11:18.540 --> 03:11:20.540
I read the short story before I played it.

03:11:28.540 --> 03:11:29.540
I played a lot.

03:11:29.540 --> 03:11:30.540
I think when I was

03:11:32.540 --> 03:11:35.540
a young, a young Mercy, baby Mercy,

03:11:35.540 --> 03:11:37.540
um,

03:11:38.540 --> 03:11:40.540
what, what happened

03:11:42.540 --> 03:11:43.540
in,

03:11:43.540 --> 03:11:45.540
what used to happen was

03:11:47.540 --> 03:11:48.540
maybe older,

03:11:48.540 --> 03:11:50.540
a bit of older supplies will know.

03:11:54.540 --> 03:11:57.540
Do you remember the era

03:11:57.540 --> 03:11:59.540
when

03:11:59.540 --> 03:12:01.540
video games, they would,

03:12:01.540 --> 03:12:04.540
they would put CD-ROM games on like everything.

03:12:04.540 --> 03:12:06.540
So in like your cereal,

03:12:06.540 --> 03:12:08.540
your macaroni,

03:12:08.540 --> 03:12:10.540
like you would just get,

03:12:10.540 --> 03:12:13.540
get CD-ROM games as a bonus content.

03:12:17.540 --> 03:12:18.540
So

03:12:19.540 --> 03:12:21.540
that's how I got into point and click.

03:12:22.540 --> 03:12:24.540
Because I got,

03:12:26.540 --> 03:12:27.540
I got one

03:12:29.540 --> 03:12:30.540
called,

03:12:31.540 --> 03:12:32.540
from Disney.

03:12:35.540 --> 03:12:37.540
Called Hades Challenge.

03:12:45.540 --> 03:12:48.540
Called Hades Challenge that I got,

03:12:48.540 --> 03:12:50.540
I believe from

03:12:51.540 --> 03:12:52.540
a cereal.

03:12:53.540 --> 03:12:54.540
And

03:12:54.540 --> 03:12:56.540
I've never been the same ever since.

03:12:59.540 --> 03:13:00.540
Playing flash games.

03:13:00.540 --> 03:13:02.540
Yes, I used to play flash games.

03:13:02.540 --> 03:13:04.540
There was one

03:13:04.540 --> 03:13:06.540
point and click that no one could solve.

03:13:06.540 --> 03:13:08.540
But I was the only one

03:13:08.540 --> 03:13:11.540
amongst, amongst my peers

03:13:11.540 --> 03:13:12.540
in,

03:13:13.540 --> 03:13:16.540
in school, in school, in grade school.

03:13:24.540 --> 03:13:25.540
That,

03:13:25.540 --> 03:13:27.540
that solved it.

03:13:28.540 --> 03:13:29.540
It was called Detention.

03:13:29.540 --> 03:13:31.540
It was called Detention.

03:13:32.540 --> 03:13:33.540
Detention.

03:13:38.540 --> 03:13:40.540
Three decades ago, that can't be right.

03:13:44.540 --> 03:13:46.540
So yeah, I played

03:13:46.540 --> 03:13:48.540
that one.

03:13:48.540 --> 03:13:50.540
And yeah, I've never,

03:13:50.540 --> 03:13:52.540
it's, it's ended up being my favorite genre.

03:13:52.540 --> 03:13:54.540
My favorite genre

03:13:54.540 --> 03:13:56.540
for games are definitely like,

03:13:56.540 --> 03:13:58.540
kind of detective, detective.

03:13:58.540 --> 03:14:00.540
That's why I really like a lot of horror,

03:14:00.540 --> 03:14:02.540
not, not first person horror.

03:14:02.540 --> 03:14:03.540
They make me barf.

03:14:03.540 --> 03:14:04.540
I'm sorry.

03:14:04.540 --> 03:14:05.540
If,

03:14:05.540 --> 03:14:06.540
like,

03:14:06.540 --> 03:14:07.540
cosmophobia,

03:14:07.540 --> 03:14:08.540
I can't do it.

03:14:08.540 --> 03:14:09.540
I have,

03:14:09.540 --> 03:14:11.540
I have a game called,

03:14:13.540 --> 03:14:15.540
what was this game called again?

03:14:15.540 --> 03:14:16.540
Anyways, it's a lovecraftian one.

03:14:16.540 --> 03:14:18.540
First person makes me barf.

03:14:18.540 --> 03:14:19.540
Can't do it.

03:14:25.540 --> 03:14:26.540
Can't do it.

03:14:26.540 --> 03:14:28.540
That one is

03:14:31.540 --> 03:14:32.540
I like horror.

03:14:32.540 --> 03:14:35.540
So that's why I like a lot of horror visual novels.

03:14:35.540 --> 03:14:38.540
Because I feel like it's unraveling a mystery.

03:14:38.540 --> 03:14:40.540
So I like the story,

03:14:40.540 --> 03:14:41.540
story aspect of it.

03:14:41.540 --> 03:14:42.540
That's why,

03:14:42.540 --> 03:14:44.540
that might be a reason why I really like pointing click as well,

03:14:44.540 --> 03:14:45.540
is because like,

03:14:45.540 --> 03:14:47.540
you kind of unravel the mystery.

03:14:47.540 --> 03:14:49.540
I like putting things together.

03:14:49.540 --> 03:14:50.540
It's really fun.

03:14:53.540 --> 03:14:55.540
I haven't played the full throttle yet.

03:14:55.540 --> 03:14:56.540
Um,

03:14:56.540 --> 03:14:57.540
the one

03:14:57.540 --> 03:14:58.540
I did play

03:14:58.540 --> 03:14:59.540
for

03:14:59.540 --> 03:15:00.540
Call of Cthulhu

03:15:00.540 --> 03:15:01.540
for a pointing click,

03:15:01.540 --> 03:15:03.540
which was called prisoner of ice.

03:15:03.540 --> 03:15:04.540
I think

03:15:04.540 --> 03:15:06.540
it was just called prisoner of ice.

03:15:06.540 --> 03:15:08.540
And then I think it got adapted into the Call of Cthulhu

03:15:08.540 --> 03:15:09.540
brand.

03:15:10.540 --> 03:15:11.540
I'm not sure.

03:15:14.540 --> 03:15:15.540
Not sure.

03:15:15.540 --> 03:15:16.540
Grim Fandango.

03:15:16.540 --> 03:15:18.540
I've already played Grim Fandango.

03:15:18.540 --> 03:15:20.540
I've already played Grim Fandango.

03:15:20.540 --> 03:15:22.540
I've already played Grim Fandango.

03:15:22.540 --> 03:15:24.540
I've already played Grim Fandango.

03:15:24.540 --> 03:15:26.540
I've already played Grim Fandango.

03:15:26.540 --> 03:15:27.540
Yeah.

03:15:27.540 --> 03:15:28.540
Um,

03:15:31.540 --> 03:15:32.540
Cata,

03:15:32.540 --> 03:15:33.540
Categra?

03:15:33.540 --> 03:15:35.540
I think I actually have Categra.

03:15:38.540 --> 03:15:39.540
Categra?

03:15:39.540 --> 03:15:40.540
I don't know.

03:15:40.540 --> 03:15:41.540
Do I have it?

03:15:44.540 --> 03:15:45.540
I might not.

03:15:45.540 --> 03:15:47.540
I have some,

03:15:47.540 --> 03:15:49.540
some games on my wishlist too.

03:15:55.540 --> 03:15:57.540
Talking about Call of Cthulhu prisoner of ice.

03:15:57.540 --> 03:15:58.540
Yes, yes, yes.

03:15:58.540 --> 03:16:00.540
Have you read Dead End?

03:16:00.540 --> 03:16:01.540
I guess not yet.

03:16:01.540 --> 03:16:02.540
Not yet.

03:16:06.540 --> 03:16:07.540
Uh,

03:16:07.540 --> 03:16:09.540
the next game I was planning to play

03:16:09.540 --> 03:16:11.540
for visual novels was,

03:16:11.540 --> 03:16:12.540
what was it called again?

03:16:12.540 --> 03:16:13.540
Muv Love.

03:16:13.540 --> 03:16:15.540
I was planning to play Muv Love

03:16:15.540 --> 03:16:16.540
for my next visual novel.

03:16:17.540 --> 03:16:18.540
But,

03:16:19.540 --> 03:16:21.540
I might save it

03:16:21.540 --> 03:16:23.540
to, to read with some pies.

03:16:24.540 --> 03:16:25.540
In the future.

03:16:37.540 --> 03:16:38.540
Which Muv Love?

03:16:38.540 --> 03:16:39.540
Probably the first one.

03:16:39.540 --> 03:16:41.540
I like going in order.

03:16:41.540 --> 03:16:42.540
Unless people don't,

03:16:42.540 --> 03:16:44.540
unless people don't suggest that,

03:16:44.540 --> 03:16:45.540
then maybe I,

03:16:45.540 --> 03:16:47.540
I'll play a different one.

03:16:47.540 --> 03:16:48.540
Like,

03:16:53.540 --> 03:16:54.540
but I'm not really sure.

03:16:54.540 --> 03:16:56.540
I have a lot of games I,

03:16:56.540 --> 03:16:57.540
I want to play.

03:16:57.540 --> 03:16:58.540
There's also,

03:16:58.540 --> 03:16:59.540
there's also a bunch of newer games

03:16:59.540 --> 03:17:00.540
that I want to play too.

03:17:00.540 --> 03:17:01.540
Like, I really want to play

03:17:01.540 --> 03:17:02.540
the Princess Peach game.

03:17:13.540 --> 03:17:14.540
Like, the Princess Peach game

03:17:14.540 --> 03:17:15.540
I really want to play

03:17:15.540 --> 03:17:16.540
and I want to play Mario RPG,

03:17:16.540 --> 03:17:17.540
the remake one.

03:17:17.540 --> 03:17:18.540
So,

03:17:18.540 --> 03:17:19.540
there's some,

03:17:19.540 --> 03:17:20.540
some games that I really want to play

03:17:20.540 --> 03:17:21.540
that are like newer.

03:17:27.540 --> 03:17:28.540
Are you interested in fallout games

03:17:28.540 --> 03:17:29.540
that are point and click?

03:17:29.540 --> 03:17:31.540
The older fallout games?

03:17:31.540 --> 03:17:32.540
Really?

03:17:34.540 --> 03:17:35.540
First Muv Love

03:17:35.540 --> 03:17:38.540
is more rom-com alternative sci-fi one.

03:17:39.540 --> 03:17:41.540
Then maybe I'll play alternative instead.

03:17:47.540 --> 03:17:48.540
Pay attention!

03:17:48.540 --> 03:17:50.540
Pay attention, Senpai!

03:17:52.540 --> 03:17:53.540
Didn't you pay attention

03:17:53.540 --> 03:17:54.540
to my likes and dislikes before?

03:17:54.540 --> 03:17:56.540
I'll have to remind you again!

03:17:59.540 --> 03:18:01.540
I'll have to remind my Senpais again!

03:18:04.540 --> 03:18:05.540
Silly?

03:18:11.540 --> 03:18:12.540
Silly?

03:18:12.540 --> 03:18:13.540
Silly?

03:18:15.540 --> 03:18:16.540
What's on my list?

03:18:16.540 --> 03:18:17.540
What's on my list?

03:18:17.540 --> 03:18:20.540
These are what I have on my list, Senpai!

03:18:24.540 --> 03:18:25.540
Memorize it!

03:18:25.540 --> 03:18:26.540
Memorize it!

03:18:36.540 --> 03:18:37.540
You memorizing it?

03:18:37.540 --> 03:18:38.540
Yes?

03:18:38.540 --> 03:18:39.540
Good!

03:18:39.540 --> 03:18:40.540
I gave you a little time.

03:18:43.540 --> 03:18:44.540
Good!

03:18:50.540 --> 03:18:51.540
Good, good, good.

03:18:51.540 --> 03:18:52.540
You all memorize it.

03:18:52.540 --> 03:18:53.540
That's very good.

03:18:57.540 --> 03:18:59.540
Please don't be a quiz on this later.

03:18:59.540 --> 03:19:01.540
I just remember...

03:19:02.540 --> 03:19:03.540
I just want you guys to remember

03:19:03.540 --> 03:19:05.540
which games that I have already said

03:19:05.540 --> 03:19:06.540
that are my favorites.

03:19:07.540 --> 03:19:09.540
So we don't have any repeats.

03:19:09.540 --> 03:19:10.540
Understand?

03:19:10.540 --> 03:19:11.540
I'm just kidding.

03:19:19.540 --> 03:19:20.540
So those are a lot of games

03:19:20.540 --> 03:19:22.540
that are considered the best for me.

03:19:22.540 --> 03:19:24.540
I might like things,

03:19:24.540 --> 03:19:26.540
but these are the games that I love.

03:19:27.540 --> 03:19:28.540
I hope that makes sense.

03:19:28.540 --> 03:19:30.500
that are considered the best of the best for me.

03:19:30.500 --> 03:19:33.180
I might like things, but like these are the games

03:19:33.180 --> 03:19:35.380
that I love.

03:19:35.380 --> 03:19:36.580
I hope that makes sense.

03:19:40.580 --> 03:19:41.580
Ha ha ha ha!

03:19:43.740 --> 03:19:44.820
Have you ever tried Fighting Game?

03:19:44.820 --> 03:19:45.660
Yeah.

03:19:45.660 --> 03:19:50.580
One Fighting Game I'm only kind of decently okay at

03:19:50.580 --> 03:19:51.820
was Tekken.

03:19:53.140 --> 03:19:56.300
When I say decently kind of okay, I mean,

03:19:56.300 --> 03:19:59.700
I made one person rage quit once and I feel like

03:19:59.700 --> 03:20:01.820
that was pretty good.

03:20:08.060 --> 03:20:09.700
Oh yeah, I play Kuma by the way.

03:20:09.700 --> 03:20:11.220
I play Kuma.

03:20:11.220 --> 03:20:13.980
A game that felt pretty good when I played it

03:20:13.980 --> 03:20:18.140
as a Fighting Game was Arms.

03:20:18.140 --> 03:20:19.700
I really liked Arms.

03:20:19.700 --> 03:20:21.300
I would say Arms is a fighting game.

03:20:21.300 --> 03:20:23.820
So I really liked the feel of Arms.

03:20:23.820 --> 03:20:28.820
I love using the joystick controllers for Arms,

03:20:28.980 --> 03:20:32.140
where you like literally punch like wow, wow, wow, wow.

03:20:32.140 --> 03:20:34.220
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

03:20:34.220 --> 03:20:35.740
That felt really good.

03:20:35.740 --> 03:20:38.420
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

03:20:38.420 --> 03:20:41.180
And I was like wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!

03:20:44.380 --> 03:20:45.140
Tend to switch arms?

03:20:45.140 --> 03:20:46.180
Yeah, that one.

03:20:47.180 --> 03:20:48.260
That one felt really good.

03:20:48.260 --> 03:20:51.420
I love whacking people using the joystick controllers.

03:20:51.540 --> 03:20:53.180
Da da da da da da da da!

03:20:53.180 --> 03:20:54.700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

03:20:56.260 --> 03:20:57.260
That was really fun.

03:20:59.300 --> 03:21:01.540
What's another fighting game that I kind of like?

03:21:03.380 --> 03:21:08.380
I kind of really like the feel of Dead or Alive as well.

03:21:13.900 --> 03:21:14.940
Is that game still active?

03:21:14.940 --> 03:21:16.540
I don't think Arms is still active,

03:21:16.540 --> 03:21:20.380
but if you guys make Arms active again,

03:21:20.380 --> 03:21:22.580
I might do some training sessions

03:21:22.580 --> 03:21:24.780
and I might beat the shit out of everyone.

03:21:24.780 --> 03:21:26.780
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

03:21:33.540 --> 03:21:34.780
Are you with 2D fighters?

03:21:34.780 --> 03:21:37.380
I don't really play 2D fighters, honestly.

03:21:39.900 --> 03:21:42.340
The feel of the jiggles, the feel of the game.

03:21:42.340 --> 03:21:45.140
I know people are like oh my gosh, that's a porn game.

03:21:45.140 --> 03:21:46.260
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

03:21:46.900 --> 03:21:50.060
It's all shitty, it's a shitty, sexy lady game.

03:21:51.340 --> 03:21:53.140
I have to preach.

03:21:53.140 --> 03:21:56.620
I'm just letting you guys know that it feels good.

03:21:56.620 --> 03:21:58.420
Like I feel like the impact,

03:21:58.420 --> 03:22:02.140
you feel the impact of when they hit each other pretty good.

03:22:05.300 --> 03:22:06.460
Does that make sense?

03:22:09.740 --> 03:22:11.460
I don't really play any other games

03:22:11.460 --> 03:22:14.380
because, well, it's too technical for me.

03:22:16.700 --> 03:22:17.860
And I don't really like that.

03:22:17.860 --> 03:22:18.980
I don't really like it.

03:22:23.500 --> 03:22:24.700
I don't really like it.

03:22:24.700 --> 03:22:25.780
So it's whatever.

03:22:29.180 --> 03:22:32.020
That one, yeah.

03:22:32.020 --> 03:22:35.860
Yeah, those are the fighting games I enjoy.

03:22:35.860 --> 03:22:39.980
Otherwise, I don't really play a lot of fighting games,

03:22:39.980 --> 03:22:43.100
mostly because it's kind of required

03:22:44.020 --> 03:22:45.540
to play with other people.

03:22:45.540 --> 03:22:50.540
I'm kind of a loner.

03:22:52.380 --> 03:22:54.260
I'm kind of a solo player.

03:22:54.260 --> 03:22:57.260
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

03:23:02.740 --> 03:23:05.700
Um, have you ever played with a PS Vita?

03:23:05.700 --> 03:23:08.380
Yeah, a PS Vita was my second console

03:23:08.380 --> 03:23:11.620
that I have ever had.

03:23:11.620 --> 03:23:13.940
I had a PS Vita before I had a PS4.

03:23:21.020 --> 03:23:25.060
Um, yeah.

03:23:26.740 --> 03:23:29.020
You tried Monster Hunter before?

03:23:29.020 --> 03:23:31.700
This might sound a little weird

03:23:31.700 --> 03:23:35.580
coming from, well, a Yandere,

03:23:35.580 --> 03:23:38.580
but I feel kind of bad hitting the monsters,

03:23:38.580 --> 03:23:42.260
which is why I don't really like Monster Hunter,

03:23:42.260 --> 03:23:43.940
or I don't really want to play Monster Hunter.

03:23:43.940 --> 03:23:45.500
I feel bad for hitting them.

03:23:45.500 --> 03:23:47.740
I think they're really cute.

03:23:47.740 --> 03:23:49.380
So I feel bad for hitting them.

03:24:00.940 --> 03:24:02.420
You feel bad for hitting us?

03:24:03.220 --> 03:24:03.980
Mmm.

03:24:06.980 --> 03:24:10.980
Sometimes, but sometimes I feel bad,

03:24:10.980 --> 03:24:16.380
but I feel like, you know,

03:24:16.380 --> 03:24:18.660
sometimes SEMPAI deserved it,

03:24:18.660 --> 03:24:21.220
and sometimes SEMPAI forces my hand.

03:24:23.700 --> 03:24:28.100
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

03:24:33.220 --> 03:24:44.740
Sometimes my hand's forced.

03:24:44.740 --> 03:24:45.820
I don't want to.

03:24:45.820 --> 03:24:50.020
I don't want to hurt my SEMPAI, but, you know,

03:24:52.940 --> 03:24:54.700
sometimes you have to.

03:24:57.220 --> 03:24:58.060
OK?

03:24:58.060 --> 03:25:09.340
Sometimes we, we have to, I, it's always my arm being twisted, it's always my arm being

03:25:09.340 --> 03:25:16.860
twisted I never want to do anything but sometimes I always want to run away from me or, or you

03:25:16.860 --> 03:25:39.740
know, they do ridiculous things like want to leave so yeah sometimes I have to punish I don't

03:25:39.740 --> 03:25:44.380
want to it hurts it hurts my feelings hurts my feelings a whole lot

03:25:54.220 --> 03:26:01.500
so when that happens I I might get a little violent I might get a little not violent I'd

03:26:01.500 --> 03:26:04.060
rather say I get a little strict yeah yellow strict

03:26:10.540 --> 03:26:16.300
oh wait what were we talking about again I am monster hunter yeah I feel bad for hitting them

03:26:16.300 --> 03:26:22.780
I feel bad for hitting the them so I I don't really play monster hunter I just feel bad

03:26:31.980 --> 03:26:39.420
so I'm trying to think what are we talking about games right games yeah I have like a lot of games

03:26:39.420 --> 03:26:47.660
that I want to try playing so I tried to pick a variety of different games that this week that I

03:26:47.660 --> 03:26:56.940
personally really like so like an RPG I don't like punishing games but I feel like a difficult game

03:26:56.940 --> 03:27:03.980
about climbing is very entertaining for senpai's um because you'll hear me hear me get like really

03:27:03.980 --> 03:27:09.100
angry and scream a lot so I warn I'll warn everyone that's a pretty loud that's gonna be a pretty

03:27:09.100 --> 03:27:23.660
loud stream so please keep your uh volumes at a fairly low fairly fairly low um fairly fairly low

03:27:23.660 --> 03:27:27.900
volume yeah

03:27:33.980 --> 03:27:39.420
strategies games oh I get bored with strategy games um

03:27:43.020 --> 03:27:51.100
yeah I get bored with uh strategy games I don't think how do I say this senpai I'm not a very

03:27:54.620 --> 03:27:58.380
seasoned gamer I don't think I'm ready for Elden Ring yet

03:28:00.860 --> 03:28:08.940
I don't think I'm ready for Elden Ring yet so like any souls like games I don't think I'm ready for it yet

03:28:12.060 --> 03:28:18.300
because um I've only kind of recently started picking up games again uh

03:28:18.620 --> 03:28:29.180
you know uh mercy mom mercy mercy mama mercy papa are a bit strict

03:28:30.860 --> 03:28:34.220
so I only recently got a lot of freedom

03:28:41.100 --> 03:28:46.300
so I recently only got a lot of freedom and I decided to use that freedom to play games

03:28:46.300 --> 03:28:51.500
yeah so I'm still I feel I consider myself a beginner because otherwise the game before

03:28:51.500 --> 03:28:57.420
that I played before that were all either just like visual novels and like Pokemon

03:29:00.540 --> 03:29:09.340
um so I I'm very late to gaming um my parents never let me have like a sit-down console where

03:29:09.340 --> 03:29:13.980
you know you put a home console where you put it on the the tele a tv

03:29:17.020 --> 03:29:26.380
that one I've never got got one of those so only when I got older I was allowed to have a

03:29:28.220 --> 03:29:35.500
I was all I was allowed to have a handheld system so the handheld system I got was a DS light

03:29:35.500 --> 03:29:45.660
the only reason I got a DS light was because mama and papa saw that saw a commercial for big brain academy

03:29:47.740 --> 03:29:50.620
and that's the only reason why I was able to get a DS

03:29:55.740 --> 03:30:01.100
which pokemon have you played I'm not a big pokemon person so I've only played

03:30:01.740 --> 03:30:09.420
Pearl platinum whatever the news soul silver

03:30:12.140 --> 03:30:14.620
I think I ended at soul silver

03:30:16.220 --> 03:30:22.140
yeah anything after black was like no and I think I picked it up again with

03:30:24.380 --> 03:30:26.780
Sword and Shield I don't remember which one I have

03:30:27.740 --> 03:30:33.180
I picked it up again with the newer installment I forgot what the newer installment is called

03:30:37.260 --> 03:30:39.500
yeah I played the the DS ones yeah

03:30:43.020 --> 03:30:47.020
yeah Scarlet and Violet yeah I played I think I have Violet yeah I have Violet

03:30:47.100 --> 03:30:49.660
so

03:30:53.660 --> 03:31:00.460
yeah I I got a DS because of that and then after I got good grades and stuff I was

03:31:00.460 --> 03:31:09.420
allotted to pick I was allowed to pick one game one game that was that I was gonna I'm gonna get

03:31:09.420 --> 03:31:15.980
and I picked pokemon pearl that's my second game because everyone loved it and then I lined up I

03:31:16.140 --> 03:31:24.700
lined up for the midnight release of pokemon diamond and pearl and then I got pearl because

03:31:24.700 --> 03:31:31.260
there was a kid with me who was like pink is for girls so I'm gonna get diamond and so I got I

03:31:31.260 --> 03:31:36.860
felt really vindictive at that point and was like fuck you I'll get pearl I'll beat the chair you

03:31:37.580 --> 03:31:39.580
know

03:31:42.460 --> 03:31:46.140
that's that's what I had decided

03:31:54.140 --> 03:32:01.340
I felt I felt really angie about that so I decided to get pearl just to spite him

03:32:01.500 --> 03:32:08.860
and so the midnight release was really cool that was my first time doing our midnight release

03:32:09.420 --> 03:32:19.660
uh game and then I slowly convinced uh if I kept on getting good grades I would be treated to games

03:32:20.700 --> 03:32:29.420
and so I slowly built up a pretty impressive 3ds library I mean not 3ds a DS library sorry

03:32:31.900 --> 03:32:42.700
so that's why I am kind of new to gaming I'm kind of new to gaming um my first sit-down console

03:32:42.700 --> 03:33:00.140
was a ps4 so yeah I played a back then back then I I was so happy because uh because DS games are

03:33:00.140 --> 03:33:08.060
really cheap DS games are really cheap it was so it was so easy to get and now get and now

03:33:08.060 --> 03:33:13.420
nowadays I look at the prices of games and go whoa when did that happen

03:33:16.380 --> 03:33:24.380
and but yeah eventually I got myself I convinced I convinced um

03:33:25.340 --> 03:33:32.460
I'm a kuma and pop a kuma to let me have a PS Vita and then I ended up getting a PSP

03:33:33.420 --> 03:33:40.300
for pretty cheap because the Vita came out the Vita came out so I got a PSP as well and then

03:33:45.820 --> 03:33:47.820
and then I

03:33:50.060 --> 03:33:52.060
I uh

03:33:54.380 --> 03:34:01.980
I started to play more gamer games by that time so the gamer games I was playing

03:34:01.980 --> 03:34:17.900
Assassin's Creed Liberation I played Persona 3 portable at that time I got I was lucky in stores

03:34:17.900 --> 03:34:29.340
one time I saw it was like I think Persona Innocence and I got I started and then I started to

03:34:29.340 --> 03:34:35.900
really like the SMT series so then I got really into the SMT series and then when

03:34:36.860 --> 03:34:47.580
SMT4 came out I bought the like what was it the beginner not the beginner limited yeah

03:34:47.580 --> 03:34:56.060
limited edition version of it and I fell in love with that game I fell in love with SMT4

03:34:57.340 --> 03:35:03.820
and then I I tried to play like other games in the SMT series as well and I started to

03:35:03.820 --> 03:35:14.780
really like them and then eventually in college college I started to pick up uh retro games because

03:35:14.860 --> 03:35:20.780
some of my my gal pals some of my gal pals were like oh well I don't really need I need I'm

03:35:20.780 --> 03:35:27.020
making room do you want these consoles and these games and I said yes and then they they gave me

03:35:27.020 --> 03:35:35.740
some they they graciously gave me some pretty pretty pog uh retro games and and their systems so

03:35:35.740 --> 03:35:42.060
I was really surprised that I was just given given to them so I uh I acquired quite a collection right

03:35:42.060 --> 03:35:47.260
now yeah I I acquired such a

03:35:49.820 --> 03:35:54.460

03:37:36.540 --> 03:37:45.980
and I would love to play them I love to play them I also have a few PS3 games but I think I have

03:37:45.980 --> 03:37:54.540
mostly PS2 games in my collection so those are the games I really enjoyed

03:37:57.580 --> 03:38:03.980
uh or at least uh things that I'm gonna try to get into I'm gonna see if I can do streams with uh

03:38:04.940 --> 03:38:13.660
like with the native um with the native consoles so that I'm I'm planning to maybe put like a

03:38:13.660 --> 03:38:19.580
little CRT on my on my little desk and uh play games from there

03:38:23.340 --> 03:38:27.900
so that's why I'm thinking I'm thinking that's what I'm gonna do I want to play the games that

03:38:27.980 --> 03:38:40.540
are in the kind of pile of stuff that I already have because yeah I think I don't want to be that

03:38:40.540 --> 03:38:46.060
person who keeps on buying games who keeps on buying games and not play them

03:38:46.140 --> 03:38:48.220
um

03:38:57.580 --> 03:39:03.740
so yeah I am uh the small small one it's not it's a bit heavy but it's not too bad

03:39:08.060 --> 03:39:13.100
so I'd like to go through those through games that I already have so if I do have a game that

03:39:13.100 --> 03:39:15.340
people have suggested well maybe I'll play it

03:39:26.620 --> 03:39:34.460
so that's why yeah I'm thinking I'm hoping I'm hoping I'll be able to get uh what do you call that

03:39:34.860 --> 03:39:41.980
and an hd upscaler I think that's what they're called

03:39:44.220 --> 03:39:53.740
or borough one whatever borough one permanently I think it's called an hd upscaler uh to stream the

03:39:53.740 --> 03:40:06.940
games so hopefully and then I'll find like some ways to to make sure all the games all the system

03:40:06.940 --> 03:40:17.500
can be streamed on yeah I've I've done uh I gotta do a little bit of research but I think we can get it

03:40:18.300 --> 03:40:28.140
I think we can get it and most of my plans have been um

03:40:30.140 --> 03:40:38.060
been uh been kind of like yeah I'll just go through my library my library of games to play

03:40:39.260 --> 03:40:44.220
but I did pick up something very special today guys uh some pie sorry

03:40:45.100 --> 03:40:53.340
which is I picked up something for the upcoming ASMR stream which is I don't know if it's picking up on my mic

03:40:58.620 --> 03:41:01.580
I'm not using the mic so yeah

03:41:04.060 --> 03:41:08.700
I'm not using the the the 3dl right now so we can hear it

03:41:09.500 --> 03:41:13.260
I picked up some stuff for it

03:41:19.500 --> 03:41:21.820
it'll be my first time trying out ASMR

03:41:26.060 --> 03:41:32.940
so that's I'm very I'm very new to it so for ASMR I'll

03:41:39.420 --> 03:41:40.940
get

03:41:42.940 --> 03:41:44.940
I won't be out right

03:41:47.420 --> 03:41:48.940
everyone

03:42:09.660 --> 03:42:18.700
so it'll be all whispers and I I won't be as loud and I'll try not to laugh as much

03:42:19.420 --> 03:42:26.940
so uh if if I laugh it'll be it'll be uh it'll be kind of like

03:42:27.740 --> 03:42:39.340
something like that probably I'll try my best to suppress my my

03:42:41.420 --> 03:42:41.900
laughter

03:42:46.060 --> 03:42:51.100
so I'll try to suppress it just for that just for that stream

03:42:51.260 --> 03:42:56.620
so that's why I feel

03:42:58.860 --> 03:43:05.020
yeah I feel I feel like I'm going to do my do my best to pamper my supplies

03:43:05.020 --> 03:43:12.380
I'm gonna try to pamper my supplies uh I bought a gel mask uh which I think makes a lovely little sound

03:43:12.380 --> 03:43:19.020
so I'll massage that that eye mask uh so supplies can have a nice eye massage

03:43:19.740 --> 03:43:21.500
and then

03:43:23.660 --> 03:43:32.860
and then I have I have these little little ice ice globes that I'll I'll shake and yeah

03:43:33.980 --> 03:43:39.580
I'll try my best I'll try my best to give a nice nice soft experience for supplies

03:43:40.460 --> 03:43:53.980
well that being said I'm still very new to it so it's uh I might not be perfect so don't

03:43:53.980 --> 03:44:02.700
don't don't don't put too much emphasis on it being great or anything it's definitely going to be a

03:44:02.700 --> 03:44:12.140
learning curve that's why that's why I want to I want to I want to do my best to to make Senpai happy

03:44:17.820 --> 03:44:25.500
and yeah we'll we'll see if if uh if I'm any if I'm okay at it maybe I'll do more

03:44:26.060 --> 03:44:35.420
maybe I'll do more ASMR streams depending um unfortunately no no earlickies no earlickies

03:44:35.420 --> 03:44:43.500
or anything because youtube's kind of going hard on on the no the no slurp slurp

03:44:48.860 --> 03:44:53.020
not like we'll be able to go anywhere of course not I'll force you I'll force you to do it but

03:44:53.020 --> 03:44:59.500
I still want I still want my Senpai to be like yes I want to be here you wanted to be here right Senpai

03:45:06.620 --> 03:45:07.820
you wanted to be here

03:45:13.260 --> 03:45:22.220
yeah I saw Emmys Vaude get cancelled get get get get banished got obliterated obliterated

03:45:23.820 --> 03:45:30.700
so I thought oh yeah well time to time to well probably have to I have to be more careful with

03:45:30.700 --> 03:45:37.500
ASMR so I'll do something very light and besides I'm kind of training myself to do ASMR stuff so I'll

03:45:37.500 --> 03:45:44.380
do kind of the safer work stuff so don't think that it's going to be like the oh my god Senpai

03:45:44.620 --> 03:45:53.740
don't think it's the Senpai I'm gonna stick my tongue in your ear now okay don't don't

03:45:53.740 --> 03:45:56.780
don't think don't think about don't think it's gonna be like that

03:46:04.860 --> 03:46:05.740
unfortunately

03:46:05.740 --> 03:46:17.260
please don't think of uh please don't think it's gonna be something like that because uh I'll

03:46:17.260 --> 03:46:28.380
probably get bonked I was thinking about doing a salon one in the future as well

03:46:29.100 --> 03:46:36.220
so it's like you know snip snip the hair and maybe like a little hair wash

03:46:43.180 --> 03:46:47.020
but like be careful don't move or else I'll snap your ears off

03:46:47.660 --> 03:46:57.820
so I think um

03:47:00.140 --> 03:47:04.380
yeah I can't think of anything else to yap about right now I feel like

03:47:05.980 --> 03:47:10.140
I'm gonna be a broken record at this point my brain has been fried

03:47:10.860 --> 03:47:17.820
green has been fried from learning killer 7 I'm probably gonna get used to it again don't worry about

03:47:17.820 --> 03:47:27.820
it so I'm gonna I'm gonna try my best I'm gonna try my best uh to make all my Senpai's really happy

03:47:27.820 --> 03:47:46.060
so yeah oh I feel so I feel a little bit tired I went out and uh go a bit far far to pick up

03:47:46.060 --> 03:47:53.260
some of the the ASMR stuff that I wanted to to use for Senpai so it was it was quite it was

03:47:53.260 --> 03:47:58.140
quite a far away to pick them up so

03:48:02.620 --> 03:48:05.260
I don't know if anyone's streaming or anything right now

03:48:10.220 --> 03:48:15.820
I might have to just end stream and not not raid or anything I'm not I'm still not familiar

03:48:15.820 --> 03:48:20.940
with YouTube so I don't even know if how to raid very well

03:48:23.740 --> 03:48:34.380
now I'm the last one that that that makes sense um that makes sense I I I've decided to take over

03:48:34.380 --> 03:48:40.700
the late night stuff because uh in the morning in the morning I want to help out with chores

03:48:41.660 --> 03:48:49.500
chores and and uh making sure everything's okay and ready and then I can finally visit my Senpai

03:48:49.500 --> 03:49:02.620
in the basement that's why can we be chloroformed before you go are you having trouble uh sleeping

03:49:02.620 --> 03:49:04.540
then

03:49:06.780 --> 03:49:08.540
having trouble sleeping Senpai

03:49:16.780 --> 03:49:24.140
I I do things that are uh I I do late night streams I'm a bit of a night owl actually

03:49:24.140 --> 03:49:31.180
maybe I'm more of a afternoon owl I feel more productive within the afternoons to

03:49:31.820 --> 03:49:38.940
to early evenings and then the time in the evenings is for me to relax and I feel video games are

03:49:38.940 --> 03:49:42.940
sort of relaxing

03:49:55.500 --> 03:50:00.540
uh I'm sorry that I always stream late for my Senpais or too early for my Senpai depending on

03:50:00.540 --> 03:50:07.260
what time you are but um I did pick this time because it doesn't overlap with most of the girls

03:50:09.420 --> 03:50:11.740
um honestly uh

03:50:14.140 --> 03:50:25.100
viewer has thought of so much for for Senpais so we want to we wanted to to divide the time so

03:50:25.100 --> 03:50:40.860
that there would be someone um taking over a certain time slot each each moment

03:50:41.420 --> 03:50:46.860
so I feel like uh I got the night I got the night one because I don't think anyone really picked the

03:50:46.860 --> 03:50:55.580
night uh I think Azura and I are kind of the the two night night streamers while I think morning

03:50:55.580 --> 03:51:05.660
streams or I think it's night or daytime or icy and then I think strawneys soon soon falls after

03:51:05.660 --> 03:51:13.260
and then uh I mean she be so they're they're kind of within like there's always like two girls for

03:51:13.260 --> 03:51:17.820
each time you know

03:51:23.660 --> 03:51:29.340
so I hope that that at least everyone gets to to meet up with uh with a girl or something

03:51:31.660 --> 03:51:37.180
any ideas planned for the future like karaoke yeah I I'm doing karaoke I don't think I plan

03:51:37.180 --> 03:51:47.340
karaoke until uh a couple weeks later um I plan my schedule kind of far in advance just so

03:51:48.060 --> 03:51:53.740
there'll be time to to make like thumbnails and make sure everything works and schedule

03:51:53.740 --> 03:51:56.700
and collabs and stuff so it's a lot

03:52:01.500 --> 03:52:04.940
you're actually gonna share us with the others only with VLR

03:52:07.260 --> 03:52:09.420
only with VLR because uh

03:52:11.660 --> 03:52:21.100
I I legitimately love this company like I really do and I want the best and uh

03:52:22.380 --> 03:52:27.580
I truly believe high tides floats off ships uh if you guys understand what that means

03:52:30.060 --> 03:52:32.220
so I want every girl to succeed as well

03:52:37.660 --> 03:52:40.220
so that's why that's why uh I

03:52:46.140 --> 03:52:53.180
I want I want everyone to to have a good time even if I'm sharing my senpai even if I'm

03:52:53.180 --> 03:52:57.420
sharing my senpai's but I know deep down that every senpai loves me the most

03:52:57.900 --> 03:53:02.300
so yeah

03:53:08.620 --> 03:53:15.820
because I really I really hope that everyone falls in love with uh each girl everyone works

03:53:15.820 --> 03:53:25.820
really hard I will attest to the fact that all girls work really hard so um I feel like you

03:53:25.820 --> 03:53:34.380
don't have to be into all of the girls but I feel like you should in in some way like each of the

03:53:34.380 --> 03:53:36.300
girl I hope that makes sense

03:53:42.540 --> 03:53:49.580
can I devote myself uh to only you if you want I feel very thankful if you do

03:53:50.540 --> 03:53:56.940
uh but I do encourage people to to if if I am your oh she if I am your oh she

03:53:57.660 --> 03:54:03.820
uh which I if I I I'm very thankful if if I am your oh she um

03:54:07.420 --> 03:54:15.980
thank you for choosing me but I also you know if for example if a if an event or something

03:54:15.980 --> 03:54:21.420
or a girl's a girl's having achievement I feel like we should celebrate all together

03:54:22.220 --> 03:54:22.940
does that make sense

03:54:25.900 --> 03:54:29.340
so I feel like we should still celebrate uh their achievements

03:54:29.500 --> 03:54:38.700
um

03:54:42.300 --> 03:54:46.940
like not all the girls are are very sweet and I love them all so much I will not have any

03:54:46.940 --> 03:54:48.700
VLR slander in here

03:54:49.100 --> 03:55:02.620
but yeah if you if you do have a favorite if you do have a favorite I think if it's me

03:55:02.620 --> 03:55:08.940
I'm just very honored if it's one of the other girls I'm sure they are also very happy and very

03:55:08.940 --> 03:55:18.940
blessed that you have chosen the men's there as uh as their oh she as your oh she so I'm very

03:55:20.220 --> 03:55:26.060
very very happy I feel very thankful I see a lot of people I my supplies I see a lot of

03:55:26.060 --> 03:55:31.900
some pies say that I'm their favorite which makes me really really giddy really giddy and

03:55:31.900 --> 03:55:36.860
kind of shy that's I'm kind of shy about it now

03:55:39.820 --> 03:55:43.340
but um yeah I I'm glad

03:55:47.740 --> 03:55:52.700
I'm glad I'm glad though so I'm I'm okay to share with everyone

03:55:54.380 --> 03:56:01.020
but just remember you are mine when you're here you're mine when you're here with me you're mine

03:56:01.740 --> 03:56:08.140
no one else you can talk about some people only if I talk about them otherwise it's just you

03:56:13.580 --> 03:56:14.140
all right

03:56:20.140 --> 03:56:26.140
so

03:56:31.820 --> 03:56:41.340
I'll let you go this time senpai I'll let you go but you'll be back

03:56:44.460 --> 03:56:53.580
I had lots of fun playing killer seven uh with everyone I am so happy to be here and I hope

03:56:54.460 --> 03:57:03.100
tomorrow's Omori stream will be of interest to my senpai as well um I haven't played Omori to

03:57:03.100 --> 03:57:08.460
completion at all I played a little bit of it and then I forgot what happened so it'll be almost

03:57:08.460 --> 03:57:19.980
like a fresh take almost I can almost fresh taste and then after that throughout the week I'll be

03:57:19.980 --> 03:57:26.300
pretty full uh wow I feel like a broken record now just repeating this uh the following week though

03:57:26.300 --> 03:57:32.540
I all streams will be reduced quite a significant quite significantly to about three streams

03:57:33.900 --> 03:57:41.420
three streams per and then eventually I'll probably go up up a little bit back to five

03:57:42.140 --> 03:57:50.380
up to five streams a week simply because this week I want to keep the hype going I want to

03:57:50.380 --> 03:57:55.100
keep the hype going I want senpais to get to know me better I want to know more about my senpais

03:57:55.100 --> 03:58:04.380
as well um what everyone's into what you're not into that's what I'm doing so yeah it'll be a lot

03:58:04.380 --> 03:58:16.460
of rest rest because oh my gosh I was so stressed and nervous when debut happened like when I stood

03:58:16.460 --> 03:58:29.420
