Tenpai, I saw you at school today I took your picture, man, I snuck away
I want you to notice me But I'm just someone you don't notice
Well, I think I've got a rival I have to kill
Please notice me, senpai Please notice me, senpai
Please notice me, senpai I am, there's no hope to die
Please notice me, senpai Please notice me, senpai
Please notice me, senpai I am, there's no hope to die
My heart beats faster when I'm near you I get so nervous, I don't know what to do
I don't mean to seem aloof I've got to push another student off the roof
And I drag the body to the furnace To destroy all the proof, why won't you
Please notice me, senpai Please notice me, senpai
Please notice me, senpai I am, there's no hope to die
Please notice me, senpai Please notice me, senpai
Please notice me, senpai I am, there's no hope to die
If anyone else will die, only you and I will be left standing
This one on my mind might not know why
Please, why won't you notice me, Senpai?
Please notice me, Senpai
Please notice me, Senpai
Please notice me, Senpai
I promise we'll have to die
Please notice me, Senpai
Please notice me, Senpai
I promise we'll have to die
