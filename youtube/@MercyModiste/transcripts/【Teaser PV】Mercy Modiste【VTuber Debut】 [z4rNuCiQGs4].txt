What better story than that of a modest young student turned violent yandere overnight?
I didn't always look like this, but maybe you're enjoying the view.
You better be careful staring at me like that.
I might want to call you my next senpai.
Oh, don't ask what happened to the last one.
I'm Mercy Modiste.
Because either way, you'll be screaming for mercy.
I'd say don't be scared of me, but fear is a top shelf ad for DZAC.
Hahahaha!
Oh, come on.
Don't pretend you don't want more of me.
So I better see you on June 1st.
That's when I debut.
Senpai.
