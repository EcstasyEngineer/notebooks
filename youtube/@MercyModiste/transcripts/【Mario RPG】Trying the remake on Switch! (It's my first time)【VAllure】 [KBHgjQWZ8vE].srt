00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:45,060
Mario, the hook castle's shaking, oh, it's a star, and a sword, with eyes, uh oh,

00:12:45,060 --> 00:13:03,460
oh, well, rip, Bowser's castle, you're our star Mercy, you're my star Senpai, Super Mario,

71
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:31,860
ah, PG, what, Mario's pad, oh, when did he get a pipe for a chimney, I don't know what

72
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,460
sounds like, so, hey Mario, lots of people use something called door to go in and out

73
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:49,220
of their houses, anyway, I came by to pick up Princess Peach since she's bit late, yep,

74
00:13:49,620 --> 00:14:07,140
oh, look, oh, he went to bed, he went to bed, wake up, oh, I have to jump, okay,

00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:16,260
I wanna hit the cuckoo clock, okay, maybe not, look, nothing is stored,

76
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:45,380
oh, hey, I thought the princess was here with you, Mario, so where is she, Mario,

77
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:50,500
what's with the silent treatment, you're not telling me something, it's Bowser again,

78
00:14:50,500 --> 00:15:01,700
isn't it, oh no, here we go again, what am I doing, some pies, Mario, would you please

79
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:10,820
bring her back like you always do, Mario, I forgot something important, if you get knocked

80
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:16,100
out, you'll wake up at the last place you saved, guess what, on this adventure, you'll save automatically,

81
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:21,060
wherever you go between areas, I'll save you all the time, so the worst comes to worst, you won't

82
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:27,300
lose too much progress, am I right, you can also hop in this thing to save, it's like the good old days,

83
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,140
we use them however you like, they're great for taking a break from your adventure,

84
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:44,340
that's everything important I can think of, now get yourself to Bowser's, keep, no, Bowser's keep,

85
00:15:44,340 --> 00:16:01,780
right, the good old days, I wanna go back up, wait, Mario's house, I labeled my house,

86
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:10,420
come on, let me jump, let me jump, let me jump, let me jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, no,

87
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:24,100
I actually have the original Mario RPG, but I found out it's the Japanese version, so I'm kind of,

88
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,420
you know, out of luck,

89
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:52,980
he labeled his house, but does he have a street address, it's Mario 10, Mario street, Mario

90
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,020
wait, what's the kingdom called again,

91
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:09,380
mushroom kingdom, right, halt, who goes there, a trespasser, this castle now belongs to us, the smithy

92
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:18,180
gang, we have big plans and this is the first step in them, if it weren't for your nosy characters

93
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:28,260
like you would practically own this world, so let's see you deal with this

94
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,340
oh

95
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:54,340
I can't believe Mario communicates and jumps, that jump was why I order

96
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,340
it

97
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,740
this is Mario language, right, oh,

98
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:24,500
where did I run off to, did I run outside again, like an idiot, yeah I did, I ran outside like

99
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:34,180
an idiot, so what do I do now, that I can't go there, can I move my thing,

100
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:51,140
okay I can't go there, so I have to go here, right, I have to go in my home, right,

101
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:00,980
held, you're back so soon, did you forget something, no what happened then,

102
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:12,660
wait, how did you walk on air Mario, the bridge to Bowser's keep is out now, just wonderful,

103
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,300
you must inform the Chancellor of the Mushroom Kingdom at once, let's go Mario

104
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,820
okay

105
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:35,780
oops excuse me, oh that bump on your head reduced your HP level, one of the Mushroom Kingdom's

106
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:42,260
famous item, I'm gonna perk you right up, got a mushroom, whenever you want to use an item to get

107
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:49,140
some help, HP back, X, eating a mushroom can give you a boost whenever you're feeling tired,

108
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,500
I should do that right now, oh now why did I rush back, I had something to tell you,

109
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,860
ah I remember, I didn't know I knew that mushroom way is swarming with monsters,

110
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,060
it has barely made it back here in one piece, Mario please do something,

111
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,660
grass that can help, you know about action commands, no let's learn about this,

112
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,780
let's learn about this together, senpai,

113
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,940
okay allow me to explain,

114
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:32,900
first we'll enter a battle, timing is important in battles, I'll show you what I mean,

115
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:48,820
first press A, hold it, now hit A as the attack hits, good timing, when successful your damage

116
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:54,580
just increases, press A with perfect timing and your attack will damage the surrounding enemies too,

117
00:20:54,580 --> 00:21:05,780
hit A as enemy attacks too, good timing, if your timing is perfect you take no damage,

118
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,700
but action commands won't save you from attacks that hit your whole party,

119
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,620
now try a special move by pressing Y,

120
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,020
Y, jump,

121
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:30,980
press A here, good timing, depending on the moves sometimes you'll have to do more than just

122
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:37,380
press a button, so keep an eye out for that, by the way each time you nail an action command

123
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,220
this action gauge fills up a little, when the action gauge reaches 100%

124
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,340
then your enemy better watch out, so look forward to that,

125
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,420
more successful action commands you do the higher this number will go,

126
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:54,740
if you can do two or more times in a row some boss will start to kick in, for you Mario the

127
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:00,660
action gauge will fill faster as power for a while is up inside, I know it's a lot to take in but

128
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,460
never fear, you press B during your battle and select help you can go over any of this again,

129
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,540
you can't even see the explanation outside of battle by selecting help from the menu,

130
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,780
now forget it's there okay,

131
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:28,740
oh I forgot to say say something, I forgot I wanted to start start uh today by saying um

132
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:41,140
um by saying thank you for last stream's um uh super chats and and uh gifted memes,

133
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:49,780
because uh I wasn't able to to to say thank you as much uh due to due to it being a collab,

134
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,220
so I wanted to say thank you uh lord peanut gallery for thousand two hundred for the five

135
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:01,700
dollar super chat, thank you darlin vita pie for the two dollar super chat, and thank you uh

136
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,020
sunken yacht club for the five dollar super chat, thank you thank you,

137
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,380
okay let's go

138
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:22,820
and there you have it, nice you still, okay I need some water

139
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:38,020
and there you have it, now you stand a fighting chance against those monsters

140
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:46,340
how does it feel to be a veal or say so representative um

141
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:57,060
surprising I came in kind of being like yeah I'm such a degen I'm I'm definitely super degenerate

142
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:01,300
and then I realized all right um I'm not

143
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:11,380
I quickly understood how I vastly overestimated my power

144
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:23,460
thank you dusk and boy for the membership tier

145
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:34,180
but like I literally I literally like yeah yeah I know I read I read a lot of dojins

146
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:39,380
I know what I'm talking about and then you know the the girls come up and they are like

147
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,820
they say some stuff and I'm like

148
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,420
uh uh maybe I'm not that freaky

149
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:05,380
like I was like oh yeah I know how to do this my my my my arrow gay list is so good

150
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:15,860
and then and then for girls they open their mouths and I'm like

151
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,860
you know what I got I don't even hold a torch to them

152
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:35,220
like I don't even hold a torch to them and so I was like it's okay it's okay

153
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:44,820
it's okay to to be the for it to be the one that's not as as you know

154
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,060
exciting

155
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,900
haha

156
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:04,980
so I'm just um I just decided to just be me and not try to

157
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:18,260
to outdo or try to match my my gen mates I'm I'm my own I'm my own person and being the say

158
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,980
someone kind of has a little bit of benefits as in

159
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,980
as in um

160
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:35,380
I feel like some people are willing to message me a little more because maybe I I feel a little

161
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,020
approachable

162
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:50,100
so I'm just like yeah yeah it's fine it's fine I think I think having the title is

163
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,300
is actually really fun

164
00:26:54,180 --> 00:27:05,460
I feel like some people are like oh it's it's not as scary or as intimidating

165
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:18,340
so uh honestly the girls are really nice they do say some out-of-pocket things but

166
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:24,180
overall I think it's not as different as other VTubers

167
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:31,460
actually I feel like we're we're quite tame or at least I'm I'm I'm tame I'm really tame

168
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,780
I don't even have any you know suss jokes

169
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:50,500
so yeah I think I think overall they're quite normal but sometimes when they say

170
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,980
things I just kind of I blush a little you know

171
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,420
oh but they're all lovely they're all lovely I love them all

172
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:11,380
that's right we need to tell the chancellor about peach

173
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,820
I'll see you over at the mushroom kingdom just in case take these with you

174
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,860
did you have problems with these monsters told

175
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:32,660
got three mushrooms I thought I thought you I thought you had trouble

176
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:40,900
I thought you had I thought okay maybe the toad voice this is a little hard I thought that you

177
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,780
have the trouble

178
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,580
okay I'm gonna practice I'm gonna practice Senpai

179
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:54,580
yeah

180
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,540
okay I suck I'm practicing

181
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:11,060
I'm gonna try to practice the timing because I'm having a little bit of trouble with it

182
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:16,500
admittedly the last time I did the timing stuff was

183
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:25,460
I think sometime last year where I was playing Super Mario Brothers

184
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:34,580
I forgot which one the Game Boy Game Boy version that's on that's on I was playing the one that's

185
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,740
on the Nintendo Switch online

186
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:46,340
Mario and Luigi yeah so I'm just gonna practice that Super Star Saga yeah yeah yeah that one

187
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,420
I'm so glad I can I can say something and then and then just be like

188
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:58,980
and then just be like it's finished like the sentence is finished by Senpai

189
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:11,220
oh okay I did it oh it should be max oh dang it oh dang it oh dang it oh dang it

190
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,620
oh okay

191
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,740
x I would no yes

192
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,260
yes

193
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:47,460
and then the only other Mario RPG I played was Thousand Years Door on the GameCube recently

194
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:57,140
Senpai Senpai thank you for the 20 super thank you Arcaneon

195
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:03,140
for the house fun and the best and lovely Kohai ever thank you so much

196
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,980
Thousand Years Door was really good my only complaint with these

197
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:20,980
Mario games so far that I played since I've only played two of them is that you know it's

198
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:34,500
pretty nice and easy until the final boss and then I want to krill myself

199
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:45,500
Any plans on playing the remake for Thousand-Year Door?

200
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
Maybe?

201
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,500
I feel like...

202
00:31:52,500 --> 00:32:00,500
I feel like, um...

203
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:05,500
Since I've already played it, I don't have that much of an interest in playing it.

204
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,500
Does that make sense?

205
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:15,500
Like, since I've already played it from start to finish, and it's kind of fresh in my memory still,

206
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
it's like one of those games where I'm just like,

207
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,500
I don't know! I don't know!

208
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:26,500
I don't know! Since I've already played it, it's not really something in my mind.

209
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:33,500
So like, if a game is like, for example, I want to play Rhapsody,

210
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:39,500
which is one of the first RPTs I've ever played,

211
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
but I don't remember much of it, then I'm just like,

212
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:48,500
okay, okay, maybe I'll play that game because I don't remember much of it.

213
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,500
Wait! Yeah!

214
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Ah!

215
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Dodging! What is that?

216
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Rhapsody and Musical Adventure? Yeah, that game!

217
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,500
I really love it!

218
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:13,500
I actually pre-ordered the Switch version because I love that one.

219
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Ooh!

220
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Oh, I can hit it more than once?

221
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Oh!

222
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Oh!

223
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Dang it!

224
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,500
I think jump works for these guys, right?

225
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
Yes!

226
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Some elements are especially effective against certain monsters,

227
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:50,500
and deal big damage by taking advantage of these weaknesses.

228
00:33:50,500 --> 00:34:00,500
I have a mushroom.

229
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:06,500
It's out!

230
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Oh no, I don't have any more!

231
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:16,500
Dang it!

232
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:29,500
Okay.

233
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Okay, look! I'm getting it, Senpai!

234
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,500
I'm getting it!

235
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Oh, shit, I missed!

236
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Yeah! Yeah, I'm getting it!

237
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:56,500
Okay, maybe the timing for the punches are not as easy.

238
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,500
I'll have another one.

239
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:25,500
Yeah.

240
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Ooh!

241
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,500
Okay, didn't get that one.

242
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,500
Oh, I'm still bad!

243
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
I'm still bad.

244
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Level up!

245
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,500
Mario reach level two!

246
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,500
Oh! Oh!

247
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:54,500
Look, look, Senpai! I can allocate my points!

248
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
Oh no!

249
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
Should I do magic?

250
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Magic or physical?

251
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
More damage.

252
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Physical.

253
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Yeah, I'll go with that one.

254
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,500
You! My life was flashing before my eyes for a second there!

255
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
Here's a little something in return!

256
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,500
Ah, honey, see that?

257
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:29,500
He's still in trouble, isn't he?

258
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Oh hey!

259
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
Oh!

260
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,500
Watch me!

261
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
Oh!

262
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:46,500
Well, it's less damage, but that's okay.

263
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
What's this, money?

264
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Flower items will permanently increase your max fp,

265
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
letting you use more specials.

266
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:59,500
These are super important, so don't forget them!

267
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:05,500
Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling!

268
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
Oh my, like, thingies are kind of in pain.

269
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,500
Maybe I have to use a different controller.

270
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,500
That's funny, it's like, how am I already in pain?

271
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:24,500
What?

272
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:31,500
I might have to switch controller some pie.

273
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
Oops!

274
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,500
That was not what I wanted.

275
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:41,500
Where was the pause button?

276
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,500
I had, like,

277
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Oh!

278
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Can I play with this one?

279
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:14,500
I think, I think I'm not used to this controller yet, Senpai.

280
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:25,500
Can I use my old controller?

281
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
Don't worry, Senpai.

282
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
The, oh, I can jump!

283
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,500
Okay, okay, these are nice.

284
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,500
These are cute.

285
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Oh, you're looking so cute!

286
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
Don't worry, Senpai.

287
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:48,500
The accounts on my, on my, on my Switch are just the shops and guest accounts.

288
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,500
I'm so bad at rhythm games!

289
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:15,500
I am using the Hori pad that Senpai's gave me.

290
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:23,500
It just hurts my, um, hurts my fingers.

291
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,500
I don't know why.

292
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
Oh, it spins!

293
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
I'm so cute!

294
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Oh!

295
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,500
Told you!

296
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:48,500
How the hell did you get up there?

297
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,500
Boy, that was a close call!

298
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,500
Here's a token of my appreciation!

299
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
My power tab!

300
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
It spooked me there!

301
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:31,500
I'm like, check my item skull high?

302
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Oh, I can do the 10 one!

303
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,500
Yeah.

304
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
Got a freebie!

305
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:49,500
Okay, I almost got it.

306
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
Actually, the timing, I just stuck.

307
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,500
Never mind, Senpai.

308
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,500
Hahaha!

309
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,500
Weee, timing!

310
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,500
Oh, I got a flower!

311
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Do you do anything special?

312
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,500
I'll try my best.

313
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,500
Why am I bad at timing?

314
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,500
Is this because I don't listen to music?

315
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,500
Is this my, is this my legacy?

316
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:01,500
Is this my, is this what happens?

317
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,500
How do I get you first?

318
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,500
Shit.

319
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,500
Spiky, well, jumping will be bad for Spiky.

320
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,500
How do I kill you?

321
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
Anyways, I'm gonna do it again.

322
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:18,500
Hey, excuse me, let me try this again.

323
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,500
Hey, are you looking at me?

324
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,500
My hammer and I don't like ya.

325
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,500
Mario, you better be careful, he's definitely got a mean streak!

326
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,500
I can just leave him?

327
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,500
I can just leave him!

328
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:40,500
Here you go, my hammer angry, you shouldn't have done that.

329
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,500
Oh, there's two of you, shit.

330
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,500
Use an item, Mario!

331
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,500
Get my health up!

332
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:38,500
I gotta get this rhythm thing down!

333
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,500
Huh?

334
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,500
The Valor?

335
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,500
Oh shit.

336
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
Oh shit.

337
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,500
Oh shit.

338
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,500
Word!

339
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,500
Word!

340
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Word!

341
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,500
Word!

342
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,500
Word!

343
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:43,500
Thanks, Mario, I was running so fast I wasn't watching where I was going!

344
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,500
A mushroom kingdom's just ahead, we're almost there, Mario!

345
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,500
Hey, where did this hammer come from?

346
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,500
Hey, you know what this is?

347
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,500
This is a hammer's broke, see now you're on it!

348
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:00,500
Now it stands a chance against you when you want them with this!

349
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,500
You never know, it might come in handy!

350
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,500
Picked up a hammer!

351
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,500
Now that we got a hammer, any escapees?

352
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,500
Let's get a move on, I'll see you in the mushroom kingdom!

353
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,500
Any secrets about somewhere?

354
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,500
Meow?

355
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,500
Oh, where'd the cloud thing go?

356
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,500
Gone.

357
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,500
Mysterious!

358
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,500
Need to equip it?

359
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,500
X.

360
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,500
I don't know where to equip it.

361
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,500
Mushroom kingdom.

362
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,500
Manual? This one? Oh!

363
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,500
Whip and hammer!

364
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,500
Armor? No equipment.

365
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,500
Accessory? Probably none.

366
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,500
Hey, let me talk.

367
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,500
I haven't seen Princess Peach lately.

368
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,500
What? Bowser's got her again?

369
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,500
Hey, Mario, look what you're standing in.

370
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,500
What am I standing in?

371
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,500
Huh, gotcha!

372
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,500
Wait, what? What was I standing in?

373
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,500
Let me in!

374
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,500
Hello, creatures' houses that I will invade.

375
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
One, two, three.

376
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,500
Think if I practiced enough I would jump as high as you, Mario?

377
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,500
Sure.

378
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,500
Yeah!

379
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:03,500
Hey, Mario, my brother's waiting for you upstairs.

380
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,500
All I do is cook and clean.

381
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,500
How depressing.

382
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,500
Did he go faster?

383
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,500
Maybe?

384
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,500
He's having a good time.

385
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,500
Oh, wait, I can talk to this one.

386
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,500
Hey, did you see a crocodile around here?

387
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,500
He talks like a mobster wannabe.

388
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,500
I'm sure he's up to no good.

389
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,500
Hey, wait a sec, my wall's gone!

390
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,500
Oh, I can just like jump there.

391
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,500
You have to know of a good wedding chapel.

392
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,500
Uh, one in Mario Odyssey.

393
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,500
Say, hey Mario, guess what?

394
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,500
Ryan isn't just a friend anymore, we're getting married!

395
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,500
Oh, congratulations on the marriage.

396
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:11,500
Now I get to jump on your bed before you do marriage duties.

397
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,500
Oh, so fast.

398
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,500
Mario, I make a great psychic for you in a few years, right?

399
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,500
Don't worry if Bowser shows up.

400
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,500
I know just how to get his gult.

401
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:32,500
I hope my grandchild turns out just to be just like the princess.

402
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,500
It's so nice to see our young ones having a good time.

403
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,500
I want to spa, spa, spa.

404
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,500
Woohoo!

405
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,500
Can I jump around here?

406
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,500
Whee!

407
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,500
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Get off there this minute!

408
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,500
No, bad. I just wanted to jump.

409
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,500
Mario, what a pleasant surprise.

410
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,500
One of the frog stages grandchild is running around errands in town today.

411
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,500
I haven't seen him, though.

412
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,500
Oh, you're here to shop? What are you looking for?

413
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,500
Um, bye.

414
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,500
What's up, pick me up?

415
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,500
I was a down-allied and planning juice.

416
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,500
Refreshing status during battle.

417
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,500
I can carry 10 of them and carry 6 of those.

418
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,500
Oh, I got balls.

419
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,500
Wait, you got shirts and stuff?

420
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,500
It's a shirt. It's a pair of pants.

421
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,500
Jump shoes?

422
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,500
Use jump attacks against any show.

423
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,500
Well, it prevents poison damage.

424
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,500
Shit, should I gotten these?

425
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,500
I'll get more money, right?

426
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,500
I got shirts. I got pants.

427
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,500
I want the jumpshoes.

428
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,500
And an old pin. Okay.

429
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,500
Here you go.

430
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
Hey, see ya!

431
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,500
Welcome!

432
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,500
Welcome!

433
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,500
Welcome!

434
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,500
Welcome!

435
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,500
Welcome!

436
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,500
Welcome!

437
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,500
Welcome!

438
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,500
Welcome!

439
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,500
Welcome!

440
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,500
Can jump on your head, because you tricked me.

441
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,500
Star?

442
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,500
I had to crash for a while. Only cost you 3 coins.

443
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,500
No, thanks.

444
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,500
Good luck, Mario.

445
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,500
I'll fuck you. I'm gonna steal this.

446
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,500
I'm gonna steal this. Yeah!

447
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,500
Classic, right?

448
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,500
Yeah.

449
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,500
Come talk to me now.

450
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,500
I'mma jump on him!

451
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,500
Ah, nothing happened.

452
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,500
Not like I'm always sleeping.

453
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,500
Oh wait, you slipped on...

454
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,500
Rip.

455
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,500
Hammer to his face. I don't want to hammer to his face.

456
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,500
Not yet.

457
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,500
What's this?

458
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,500
Background?

459
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,500
Back.

460
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,500
Okay, let's go up some more stairs.

461
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,500
Do-de-de-de-de-de.

462
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,500
Mario, hurry! The Chancellor's awaits!

463
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,500
Mario, hurry! The Chancellor awaits!

464
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,500
Mario, there you are! I'll tell the Chancellor you're here!

465
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,500
I'll wait for you down the hallway!

466
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,500
What do you mean, wait for you down the hallway?

467
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,500
Is this some kind of trick?

468
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:41,500
I'm guiding the Chancellor. Sorry, but you have to get to Chancellor's permission to pass.

469
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,500
I'm just gonna be a menace.

470
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,500
Vault guard! Better not be goofing off while I'm cleaning the guest room.

471
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,500
Now I'm gonna make a mess of it!

472
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,500
Oh ho! Gimme!

473
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,500
A menace to society!

474
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,500
What's this?

475
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,500
Stairs?

476
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,500
Scrooge.

477
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,500
Okay, since it hasn't returned yet...

478
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,500
Can you imagine how the Chancellor must feel?

479
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,500
Jump of the Princess Bed!

480
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,500
Oh, it's much bouncier!

481
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,500
It makes a more ooh sound.

482
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,500
Look, found peaches.

483
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,500
Hey, what, hey there, what do you think you're doing?

484
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,500
I'll give you this in exchange, just leave everything where it was.

485
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,500
Senpai, what did I find?

486
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,500
What did I find?

487
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,500
Did I find...

488
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,500
Canis?

489
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,500
Hahaha!

490
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,500
Man, he runs too fast.

491
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,500
Sir, Mario has arrived!

492
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,500
This way, please.

493
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,500
Mario, thank goodness you're here!

494
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,500
We heard an explosion or something at Bowser's Keep.

495
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,500
It was so loud I almost dropped my spores.

496
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,500
Excuse me, where's the Princess?

497
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,500
She departed for your house hours ago!

498
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,500
I fear the worst!

499
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,500
Could Bowser somehow be behind all this?

500
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,500
Hey, I turned into Bowser!

501
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,500
Spore's alive, you're telling us that Bowser has abducted the Princess again?

502
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,500
Uh, maybe you...

503
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:08,500
I don't know, maybe, maybe you guys should do something about that.

504
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,500
Scandalous.

505
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:17,500
Never mind, it will be up to you to enter the Keep and Rescue Princess Peach.

506
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,500
Uh-uh.

507
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:33,500
Wow, this sure raises soul, soul, soul dramatic.

508
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,500
Egan, the Keep is unassailable!

509
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,500
What awful powers that work here!

510
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,500
Mario, her life is in your hand, please save our dear Princess.

511
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,500
Hey Mario!

512
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,500
You're making sure to equip the things you get, right?

513
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:01,500
Shall I have Toad explain the process?

514
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,500
Sure, let's do it.

515
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,500
You'll equip things using the...

516
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,500
Using the menu!

517
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,500
You'll equip things using the menu by pressing the plus button.

518
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,500
Okay.

519
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,500
Please press plus button, got it.

520
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,500
Oh, he's running here!

521
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,500
Mario, choose equip!

522
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,500
Confirm with A!

523
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,500
Please equip these!

524
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,500
Use the hammer and press A!

525
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,500
And you're set!

526
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,500
There, now I feel more at ease.

527
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,500
I'll buy more armor and accessories in the Ninem Shop.

528
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,500
I'll then take care.

529
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,500
Mario!

530
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,500
Forgive me, but I can't stop worrying about the Princess.

531
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,500
Go to the cellar and prepare for your journey.

532
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,500
The vault guard will assist you.

533
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,500
Yeah, treasure!

534
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,500
Mario, the Chancellor has filled me in!

535
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,500
The vault is this way!

536
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,500
Here's the vault, let me show you around.

537
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,500
Hope you stop through the treasures.

538
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,500
This is a mushroom.

539
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,500
But you knew that by looking at it, huh?

540
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,500
These mushrooms get you from...

541
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,500
You get from treasure chests.

542
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,500
Don't work quite like the mushroom items.

543
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,500
Treasure chest mushroom restores both HP and SP when you open the chest.

544
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,500
But you can't save them for later.

545
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,500
Mushrooms you find as items only...

546
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,500
Restore your HP.

547
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,500
But you can take them with you whenever you want.

548
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,500
Oh, okay.

549
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,500
This is a flower.

550
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:49,500
Flowers or treasure chests work a little differently from those flower items.

551
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,500
Flower chest flower.

552
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,500
Treasure chest flowers.

553
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,500
Oh my gosh, I can't read.

554
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,500
Increase your flower points, HP.

555
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,500
As soon as you grab one, but you can't carry them with you.

556
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,500
Flower tabs on the other hand, you can take with you.

557
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:08,500
You can use those from the X menu when you increase your HP.

558
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,500
This is a coin.

559
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,500
These ones are worth one, and the large ones are worth ten.

560
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,500
This one's a ten.

561
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,500
That's it? That's all I get?

562
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,500
Dang.

563
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,500
The treasury in this kingdom.

564
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,500
Lacking.

565
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,500
Come back here.

566
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,500
Oh?

567
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,500
Come back here.

568
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,500
Oh, he's sad.

569
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,500
No, no, no. A little...

570
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,500
Popcorn-looking guy.

571
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,500
Ah.

572
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,500
Oh no, that reptile stole my grandpa's coins.

573
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,500
Oh, blue.

574
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,500
I can't cry.

575
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,500
Big boys don't cry, but it's just not fair.

576
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,500
What am I going to do?

577
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,500
Oh, just like me, for real, for real.

578
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,500
There's a secret.

579
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,500
Oh no, he's crying so much.

580
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,500
Was there a secret person somewhere?

581
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,500
No.

582
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,500
Oh, same though. It's okay, bro.

583
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,500
Yeah, gee, you're soaking wet, aren't you?

584
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,500
I'm alright now, sorry.

585
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,500
There's something like a good cry.

586
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,500
I agree.

587
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,500
Oh, why was I crying?

588
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,500
There was some reason.

589
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,500
Oh, you can't remember.

590
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,500
Your grandpa asked me to buy some things for him.

591
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,500
When I walked into town, that croc stopped me.

592
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,500
Oh yeah, he took it from me.

593
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,500
He stole my coin. I chased him, but he's way too fast.

594
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,500
I don't know. Let's see how you're going to take care of Bowser.

595
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,500
Wait, what?

596
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,500
Oh, he doesn't stand a chance.

597
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,500
Wow, you're the Mario.

598
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:03,500
I know all about you. You've got more jumps in you than a box of frogs.

599
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:06,500
I'm Malo, the tadpole from the tadpole pond.

600
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,500
I'm a frog.

601
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,500
Oh.

602
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,500
Okay.

603
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,500
But can you believe it? I can't jump.

604
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,500
Embarrassing, huh?

605
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,500
How about it?

606
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,500
Mario, will you help me catch that filthy thief?

607
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,500
Sure thing.

608
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,500
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

609
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:45,500
A young frog, Malo, who doesn't look at all like a frog,

610
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,500
joins Mario in his quest.

611
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,500
Well, at least they're self-aware.

612
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,500
The scrapbook has been added under your journal.

613
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:59,500
You can check it out to look back on your adventure so far.

614
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,500
Oh.

615
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:19,500
Hey, you set up for 50 years, dude.

616
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,500
Wow, thank you so much.

617
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:30,500
You know what, if Malo thinks, yeah, you know, it's fine.

618
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,500
Well, thank you so much.

619
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,500
Hi, I have something to report, sir.

620
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,500
You saw him.

621
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,500
He was here somewhere.

622
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,500
He just zoomed past me a second ago.

623
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,500
Did you see him?

624
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,500
He looks something like this.

625
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:52,500
Oh, my charades is on point.

626
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,500
Senpais grow.

627
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:00,500
We'll have to provide more hammers now.

628
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,500
And maybe double tap on some bones.

629
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:13,500
Oh, yes, exactly.

630
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,500
He's the one who took my coin.

631
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,500
Why didn't you stop them?

632
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,500
Because I forgot my bazooka at home.

633
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,500
Jeez, give me a break here.

634
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,500
Got a bazooka?

635
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,500
Whoa.

636
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:35,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

637
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,500
Oh, Senpais, you're being so kind today.

638
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,500
Thank you so much, Dastweet.

639
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,500
For the 50, gifted.

640
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:48,500
Thank you so much.

641
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:52,500
Wow, my Senpais are so generous and kind today.

642
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,500
I'm getting emotional again.

643
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,500
Just, I'm getting emotional.

644
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:00,500
Just like, just like Malo, Malo.

645
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,500
We might not have enough hammers.

646
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,500
You're right.

647
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,500
We're going to have a hammer shortage at this rate.

648
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,500
We're going to have to share.

649
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:23,500
Communal hammers.

650
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,500
Happy tears.

651
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,500
You're going to make me cry happy tears.

652
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,500
Do I have to choose between my hammer and my ping pong paddle now?

653
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,500
I think you're going to be fine, Senpais.

654
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,500
Thank you.

655
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,500
I feel so very blessed right now.

656
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,500
Thank you Senpais.

657
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,500
I'm going to try my best at Mawil.

658
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,500
But I might not be very good at it.

659
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:13,500
Thank you for, thank you for the $49.99 super griffin for buying more hammers.

660
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,500
Thank you.

661
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,500
Now we have hammers.

662
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,500
Everyone can have hammers now.

663
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,500
Thank you so much.

664
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,500
Everyone's so kind today.

665
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,500
Thank you.

666
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,500
Hammer stock.

667
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,500
I feel so happy.

668
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:41,500
Thank you.

669
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,500
Can we upgrade to sledge hammers?

670
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,500
Yeah, we'll upgrade to sledge hammers now.

671
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,500
Bigger hammers.

672
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,500
With bigger and stronger weight.

673
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:09,500
They're going to be so big and so much more forceful.

674
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,500
We are the hammer bros.

675
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,500
Yeah.

676
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,500
Senpais are the hammer bros now.

677
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,500
Come back here.

678
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:30,500
Har har.

679
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,500
Har har.

680
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,500
You's mugs will never catch me.

681
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,500
Now could I run you morons later?

682
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,500
Ooh.

683
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,500
That's him.

684
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,500
Hurry Mario.

685
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:47,500
Let's get him.

686
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,500
Mario, you might want to take this.

687
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,500
Got a map.

688
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:59,500
If you select map from the menu, you can pick a location to jump to as long as it's somewhere you've been to before.

689
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,500
What a big bottom boom.

690
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,500
I didn't do a great voice, but.

691
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,500
Oh, I wanted to see if there was a guy.

692
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,500
Senpai.

693
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,500
Senpai.

694
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,500
That's a late alert.

695
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,500
Isn't that quite a late alert?

696
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,500
Oh.

697
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:36,500
Listen, you'd be hiding too if you had a run in with the crocodile creep.

698
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,500
There he found him.

699
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,500
It did have to go through 100 alerts first.

700
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:47,500
Yeah, that's true.

701
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,500
It finally caught up.

702
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,500
Because Senpais were so kind.

703
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,500
Oh.

704
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:08,500
There he is.

705
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,500
He's probably stashed it in the big.

706
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,500
Let's nab him.

707
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,500
Are you trying to tell me?

708
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,500
Go home to mommy before you get hurt, kid.

709
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,500
Well, he just far.

710
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,500
And it's way.

711
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,500
Get in here.

712
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,500
F.P. is shared between the entire party.

713
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,500
Should you use an attack or recover?

714
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:32,500
As you learn specials, think carefully about who's to use.

715
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,500
It's fine.

716
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,500
I'm gonna learn.

717
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,500
I'm gonna practice, Senpai.

718
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,500
What's your attack?

719
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:49,500
Oh.

720
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,500
Nice.

721
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,500
Nice.

722
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,500
Nice.

723
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,500
Okay, we're doing that.

724
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,500
That's a lot of damage.

725
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:00,500
Yeah.

726
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,500
Get over here.

727
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,500
Big frog guy.

728
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:21,500
Oh.

729
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:27,500
Oh.

730
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,500
Others.

731
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,500
Gage.

732
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,500
Got Gage.

733
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,500
Move.

734
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,500
Hold assist.

735
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,500
Who knows what you might get?

736
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,500
What did I get?

737
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,500
Star gust.

738
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,500
Oh.

739
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,500
Nice.

740
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:10,500
Hey, get over here.

741
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,500
Get over here.

742
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:22,500
Oh.

743
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:27,500
Oh.

744
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,500
Oh, no.

745
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,500
That was terrible.

746
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,500
Oh.

747
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,500
Oh, that was terrible as well.

748
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:52,500
There you go.

749
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,500
I'm getting okay.

750
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,500
I'm probably gonna have to use a mushroom though.

751
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:03,500
A mallow.

752
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,500
Oh, save.

753
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,500
Save.

754
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,500
Ha ha ha.

755
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:32,500
You couldn't jump to save your life, kid, so I guess this is goodbye.

756
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:40,500
Wait a second.

757
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,500
I wanna make sure I got everything.

758
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,500
You know?

759
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,500
And explored all my options.

760
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,500
Ha ha ha.

761
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,500
No.

762
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,500
Let me do that again.

763
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,500
No.

764
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,500
Son of a bitch.

765
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,500
No.

766
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,500
No.

767
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,500
How do I get back?

768
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,500
No.

769
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,500
Am I stuck?

770
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,500
I'm so sad.

771
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,500
I'm so sad.

772
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,500
Lug it.

773
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,500
Hey, nine.

774
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,500
Ooh.

775
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,500
Ah!

776
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:26,500
Wait, did I not get anything?

777
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:27,500
Level up.

778
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,500
Mario, reach level three.

779
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,500
Learn to new moves.

780
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,500
Fireball.

781
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:33,500
Fire away.

782
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,500
Push A repeatedly.

783
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,500
Where should I put it now?

784
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,500
Physical?

785
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,500
More physical?

786
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:42,500
Physical?

787
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,500
Or more magic.

788
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,500
Oh, we can do magic.

789
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:02,500
Ah!

790
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,500
Ah, that's fine.

791
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,500
We're fine.

792
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,500
Platforming, what is that?

793
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:27,500
Oh, you're a persistent pest, but I'm 100 miles ahead of you.

794
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,500
Wait, what's this way?

795
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,500
Let's see what's this way.

796
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:53,500
I didn't get coins.

797
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,500
Only XP.

798
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,500
Get everything.

799
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:31,500
Give it up already, that treasure box is tempting, but now's not the time.

800
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,500
Me.

801
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,500
Ah!

802
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:36,500
Ah!

803
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:37,500
Fuck!

804
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,500
Ah!

805
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,500
Platforming hard!

806
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,500
Ah!

807
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:46,500
Ah!

808
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,500
Platforming hard!

809
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:11,500
Ah!

810
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:21,500
You sometimes encounter stronger than usual monsters.

811
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,500
Feeding them will get you lots of coins.

812
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:26,500
Experience an even broad coin.

813
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:29,500
She's so fine!

814
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,500
Don't worry about it!

815
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:41,500
Ah!

816
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,500
Do you have a special?

817
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,500
Senpai!

818
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,500
Senpai!

819
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:08,500
Thank you for the Super Chat, $2 Super Chat, Charlie Spur, Italian, Kohai.

820
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:10,500
It's a me!

821
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,500
Mercy all!

822
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,500
Come on, try the Thunderbolt.

823
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,500
Oh!

824
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:32,500
Ah!

825
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,500
Ah!

826
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,500
Wait, did I use jump or fire?

827
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,500
Shit!

828
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,500
Not bad.

829
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,500
Ah!

830
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,500
Frog coin!

831
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,500
I got one frog coin!

832
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,500
Didn't even need to...

833
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,500
Ah!

834
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,500
Didn't even need to...

835
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,500
Jump on it!

836
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:58,500
Oops.

837
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,500
Ah!

838
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,500
Level up!

839
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,500
Finally!

840
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:26,500
This guy needs HP!

841
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,500
You need HP!

842
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,500
I'm going with HP!

843
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,500
You need HP!

844
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:36,500
You can pass by in the field to use special...

845
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:37,500
Super Chat.

846
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:55,500
I WAS going to use specials!

847
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,500
Ah, come on!

848
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:12,500
What do you mean once again?

849
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,500
Okay.

850
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,500
I can do this!

851
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:21,500
Oh, fuck!

852
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:22,500
I can...

853
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:23,500
Yeah!

854
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,500
Fuck!

855
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:33,500
Shut up!

856
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,500
Shut up!

857
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,500
Shut up!

858
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:43,500
Shut up!

859
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,500
I can hear it!

860
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,500
I can hear it!

861
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,500
I'm trying!

862
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,500
It's in it!

863
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,500
Fuck you!

864
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,500
Fuck you!

865
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,500
And you and you and you!

866
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,500
How do you kids?

867
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,500
Get outta here!

868
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,500
Get outta here, kids!

869
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,500
Get in!

870
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,500
May we'll give up!

871
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,500
May we'll give up!

872
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,500
May we'll give up!

873
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,500
May we'll give up!

874
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,500
May we'll give up!

875
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,500
Get in!

876
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,500
May we'll give up!

877
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,500
He's gone hiding!

878
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,500
Let's see if we can sneak up behind him and catch him.

879
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,500
Oh, I dodged that!

880
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,500
What's this? You fools can't chase down a pumpkin!

881
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,500
Oh, fuck!

882
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,500
Can I get the big frog guy?

883
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,500
Thank you, frog dog.

884
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,500
You can take the Gloombies.

885
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,500
There we go.

886
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,500
Oh, I have to go behind him, right?

887
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,500
Come on, look the other way.

888
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,500
Come on.

889
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,500
Yeah!

890
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,500
What's this? You fools can't chase down a pumpkin!

891
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,500
What the fuck?

892
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,500
Get over here! Get over here!

893
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,500
Okay.

894
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,500
Where's the...

895
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,500
Where is he?

896
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,500
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!

897
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,500
Oh my god, I can't see where he's going.

898
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,500
Your eyes are much faster than your feet.

899
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,500
This rate I have to take.

900
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,500
A hundred more years to catch me.

901
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,500
Punch up on him!

902
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,500
Eh?

903
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,500
I think he just walked into him.

904
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,500
Okay.

905
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,500
He just...

906
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,500
Bug it! Bug it! Bug it! I want to train!

907
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,500
Start training!

908
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,500
These are too distracting.

909
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,500
I need my anger out of nowhere.

910
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,500
Okay.

911
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,500
Ready to go?

912
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,500
Yeah!

913
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,500
You again? This is getting old.

914
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:23,500
I'll still take you.

915
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,500
Enough! You got me fair and square.

916
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,500
I'll give you back your coin.

917
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,500
Did you really believe me? I was lying!

918
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:39,500
You bastard! You have, like, barely arms!

919
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,500
Well, here we go.

920
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,500
Ouch!

921
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,500
Okay.

922
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,500
I think I got it.

923
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,500
Ah!

924
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,500
Ten pie!

925
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,500
Ten pie!

926
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,500
Ten pie!

927
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,500
Oh, give me a moment.

928
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,500
My wrist.

929
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,500
Thank you, Tiny Spinny, for the 3-3-3.

930
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,500
You know, I want to know a fun fact.

931
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,500
If you actually wait 50 years in game,

932
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,500
I'll give up and command you

933
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,500
for waiting 50 years.

934
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,500
Then an instantly more few to the credits,

935
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,500
but only in the original Japanese version.

936
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:01,500
I didn't even wait that long in game.

937
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,500
Aw, come on!

938
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,500
Come on!

939
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,500
You can get up!

940
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,500
Oops! Forgot the block there.

941
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,500
Not that one.

942
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,500
Stage move.

943
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,500
Quad assist.

944
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,500
Okay.

945
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,500
What's this one?

946
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,500
RSS.

947
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,500
Oh!

948
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,500
Oh!

949
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,500
Attack up!

950
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,500
Yee!

951
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,500
Yeah!

952
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,500
I did it!

953
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,500
I was so close!

954
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,500
Give me back my coin out!

955
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,500
Felt you again!

956
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,500
Oh, the coin!

957
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,500
Ouch!

958
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,500
I'm going to pay you back in spades, kid.

959
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,500
Go on.

960
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,500
Take back your grubby old coin.

961
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,500
Adios, amigos!

962
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,500
Hey, we got it back!

963
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,500
You win.

964
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:28,500
Experience 8.

965
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,500
And coin 10.

966
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,500
And a flower tab.

967
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:38,500
Yee! Mario, reach level 4.

968
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,500
Max HP.

969
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:44,500
Attack.

970
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,500
Defense.

971
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,500
Magic defense.

972
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,500
You might need more magic.

973
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:52,500
You think I need to do more magic?

974
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,500
Yeah, you think so.

975
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:58,500
Or should I do more physical?

976
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,500
Because then I can do more magic, right?

977
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,500
Yeah!

978
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,500
Everyone's like,

979
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,500
Hannah! I want more Hannah power!

980
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,500
I'm going to do magic though,

981
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,500
because I think that's the smarter one.

982
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,500
Yeah, we did it!

983
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,500
We got grandpa's coin back.

984
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,500
I can finish my errand now.

985
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,500
And look at that.

986
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:28,500
That croc guy left a wallet.

987
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:30,500
Found a wallet.

988
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,500
He's going to join me.

989
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:34,500
And use the map to go to the mushroom kingdom together.

990
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,500
Yeah!

991
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,500
Map.

992
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:40,500
Mushroom.

993
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,500
Yeah.

994
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:44,500
Mario.

995
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,500
Oh, it's night time.

996
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,500
What's going on flies at night time?

997
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,500
I'm more.

998
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,500
Oh.

999
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,500
Oh.

1000
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,500
Oh, fuck.

1001
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,500
I am so bad with Mario.

1002
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:32,500
Oh.

1003
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,500
I'm so bad.

1004
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,500
Thanks Mario.

1005
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,500
I'll continue to stand and watch.

1006
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,500
But everyone seems, now everyone seems suspicious.

1007
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:08,500
Hey, look what I found.

1008
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,500
Team 10 coins. Oh, thank you.

1009
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,500
I'm going to go buy stuff.

1010
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,500
Please leave correct amount of money for the items.

1011
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:18,500
Manager.

1012
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:32,500
Oh.

1013
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,500
Can only Mario use it?

1014
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,500
You don't need any more of this item.

1015
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,500
Oh, okay.

1016
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,500
I need to pick me up.

1017
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,500
Maybe two of them.

1018
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:56,500
Maybe...

1019
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:02,500
Yeah, that's good.

1020
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:06,500
Excuse me!

1021
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,500
You want to what? How can you shop at a time like this?

1022
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,500
Just take what you want and leave the money behind.

1023
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,500
Hold on.

1024
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,500
I'm going to...

1025
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:26,500
Got pants?

1026
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,500
Weapons? No weapons?

1027
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:30,500
Here, you have to don't pin for you.

1028
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,500
Since you are...

1029
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:34,500
Since you are like a... I don't fucking know.

1030
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:38,500
You are like a house of glass.

1031
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:56,500
8 p-rains. Okay.

1032
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:00,500
8 p-rains.

1033
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,500
Oh, level up. Finally.

1034
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:26,500
I... I think you need more physical, but I feel like your magic is way better.

1035
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:32,500
Your magic is way better, but your physical sucks.

1036
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,500
That was two turn close.

1037
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:46,500
Thanks for the hand, Mario.

1038
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:48,500
Hey, there's the wall at the crocodile's side for me.

1039
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:50,500
Can I have it back? Sure.

1040
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:52,500
Thank you so much.

1041
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,500
Here, I'll give you this as a reward.

1042
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,500
Go on, take it.

1043
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:58,500
Thank you.

1044
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:02,500
I'm going to use flower tab.

1045
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,500
Can I just use it?

1046
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,500
Is it... is it like a recovery one?

1047
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,500
Is it... is flower tab like permanent?

1048
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,500
Permanent?

1049
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,500
Permanent.

1050
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:34,500
It's permanent, right?

1051
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:46,500
Okay.

1052
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:58,500
Oi.

1053
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:12,500
Yeah.

1054
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:14,500
Right, you used the jar. It's three tabs. Okay, I will.

1055
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:16,500
Shut them up, I criticize.

1056
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:22,500
Yeah.

1057
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,500
Okay.

1058
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,500
Oops.

1059
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:46,500
Yeah.

1060
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:50,500
No more.

1061
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:52,500
I'm killing all of them.

1062
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:58,500
Okay.

1063
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:16,500
The frog powers.

1064
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:20,500
How many more of them are there?

1065
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,500
Okay.

1066
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,500
Oh, I missed.

1067
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,500
I missed.

1068
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,500
Yay, I won.

1069
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:50,500
There's infinite coming out of the door.

1070
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,500
Okay.

1071
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,500
You okay?

1072
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:56,500
Mario, look what you're standing in.

1073
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,500
Ah, gotcha.

1074
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,500
So...

1075
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:16,500
What do I do?

1076
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,500
Okay, uh...

1077
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,500
Oh, shut up.

1078
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:26,500
The princess kidnapped by those things outside?

1079
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:28,500
Are they a part of this?

1080
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:32,500
Oh, maybe I should save, yeah.

1081
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:34,500
Classic save.

1082
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:38,500
Yay.

1083
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:40,500
Back to mushroom kingdom.

1084
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,500
Oh, they are coming out of the castle.

1085
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,500
I guess I'll have to just...

1086
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:48,500
force my way in.

1087
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:52,500
Oops.

1088
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:04,500
Oh, come on.

1089
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,500
Okay.

1090
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:38,500
I'm about...

1091
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:40,500
to tetral hands.

1092
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:42,500
Literally.

1093
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:44,500
How's your rash?

1094
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:46,500
It's down quite a bit, Senpai.

1095
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:48,500
It heats up every once in a while,

1096
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,500
but it's not itchy anymore, so it's still good.

1097
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:02,500
What do you think everyone won?

1098
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:04,500
All gang looks like we have...

1099
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:06,500
we have ourselves a new home.

1100
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:08,500
We pass around all day long,

1101
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,500
and there's no one here who can stand in our way.

1102
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:14,500
That's what we're leaving here.

1103
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:16,500
What did the doctor say about it, though?

1104
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:18,500
He said it was an allergic reaction,

1105
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:20,500
and that was it.

1106
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:32,500
Well, hi. Can we start a pogo stick gang?

1107
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:34,500
I have terrible balance,

1108
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:36,500
so I wouldn't even be able to go on a pogo stick.

1109
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:38,500
Wow, helpful, huh?

1110
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:40,500
Yeah, I mean,

1111
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,500
I probably will have to cancel

1112
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,500
my dermatologist...

1113
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,500
uh...

1114
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,500
thing.

1115
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:52,500
But I, like,

1116
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:54,500
basically washed...

1117
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:56,500
everything.

1118
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,500
That's the night away.

1119
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:04,500
Not so fast, pal.

1120
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:06,500
I can't even bounce.

1121
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,500
Maybe we can bounce on this head.

1122
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:16,500
Oh my gosh!

1123
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:20,500
You're using the sword as a pogo stick!

1124
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:26,500
Listen up, gang.

1125
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,500
These guys are gonna put a stop to our party.

1126
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,500
Are you happy about this?

1127
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:32,500
You're asking for it?

1128
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:34,500
Oh, you're gonna get it.

1129
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:36,500
Pick the wrong people

1130
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:38,500
not to bounce with, bub.

1131
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:40,500
How about a fat lip

1132
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:42,500
to go with that ugly mustache?

1133
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:46,500
All right.

1134
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:48,500
Should I get rid of the bodyguards first?

1135
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:10,500
I'm gonna jump on his head.

1136
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:16,500
Then...

1137
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,500
Thunderbolt?

1138
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:36,500
Ah!

1139
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:38,500
No, yo!

1140
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,500
Thanks!

1141
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:50,500
Oh!

1142
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:58,500
Ah!

1143
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:00,500
Okay.

1144
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,500
Okay.

1145
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:04,500
Relief!

1146
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:06,500
Relief!

1147
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:26,500
Nah, not yet.

1148
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:28,500
I can do Thunderbolt.

1149
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:34,500
I can't block it!

1150
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:36,500
Okay, understood.

1151
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:42,500
Now I'm just gonna hit you with my hammer.

1152
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:58,500
Okay.

1153
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:10,500
Ah!

1154
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:28,500
Okay.

1155
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:58,500
Okay.

1156
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:08,500
Ah!

1157
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,500
Ah!

1158
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:28,500
Oh, come on.

1159
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:30,500
My timing is so bad right now.

1160
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:34,500
Ah!

1161
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:38,500
I only have this honey syrup.

1162
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:40,500
It's fine.

1163
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:42,500
Why am I so bad at video games?

1164
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,500
Right, I can't block that.

1165
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:42,500
Okay.

1166
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:56,500
Focus!

1167
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:58,500
Sorry for silence. I'm focusing.

1168
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,500
Okay.

1169
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:20,500
Yay!

1170
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:28,500
One again, one again.

1171
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:30,500
Why is there a blue star there?

1172
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:42,500
As blue as Mario's eyes!

1173
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:54,500
I thought Mario's eyes were green though, to be honest.

1174
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:02,500
It's not good.

1175
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:04,500
It's not good.

1176
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:06,500
A mustachioed is strong.

1177
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:08,500
Strong, yes.

1178
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:10,500
A must born the boss.

1179
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,500
Come on.

1180
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:18,500
Gracious!

1181
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:20,500
Oh, it's you, Mario. What a relief.

1182
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:22,500
Once again, Mario, to the rescue.

1183
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:24,500
Oh, sorry. I need the voice.

1184
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:28,500
Who are those?

1185
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:30,500
Chancellor!

1186
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:32,500
Sir, thank goodness you're all right.

1187
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:40,500
Shut the fuck up, Siri.

1188
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:44,500
Shut the fuck up, Siri, that was...

1189
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:48,500
Did you?

1190
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:50,500
Sometimes you hear that?

1191
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:06,500
No? Okay.

1192
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,500
Okay.

1193
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:14,500
So, I was like, Chancellor,

1194
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,500
and then Siri suddenly went up and went,

1195
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:18,500
you're welcome, and I went...

1196
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:26,500
Mario, so you got through all this.

1197
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:28,500
We all smug to you.

1198
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:30,500
No.

1199
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:38,500
I got so scared, but I was like,

1200
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,500
whoa!

1201
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:44,500
Glad it wasn't worse.

1202
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:46,500
Yeah, me too. I'm going to have to figure out how to turn that off.

1203
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:48,500
I didn't realize.

1204
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:50,500
I've never used it before, so...

1205
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,500
It never came up until now?

1206
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:00,500
No.

1207
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,500
First the princess, now this. It's just too much to bear.

1208
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:10,500
Mario, how about you ask my grandpa

1209
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:12,500
for help? He knows everything.

1210
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:14,500
Excuse me, but who are you?

1211
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:16,500
Oh, hello. My name is Mao.

1212
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:18,500
I'm from Tadpole Pond.

1213
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:20,500
Any friends of Mario's welcome here

1214
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:22,500
in the Mushroom Kingdom.

1215
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:24,500
As I was saying, Mario,

1216
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:26,500
you're our only hope.

1217
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:28,500
Mario, please, you must rescue

1218
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:30,500
the princess now!

1219
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:32,500
I know, I'm in your debt, too.

1220
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:34,500
Let's head over to grandpa's place

1221
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:36,500
in Tadpole Pond. You can help.

1222
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:40,500
Wait, why did I even come to the Mushroom Kingdom

1223
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:42,500
in the first place?

1224
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:44,500
Please don't find us in enough!

1225
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:48,500
You were supposed to...

1226
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:50,500
to get something.

1227
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:52,500
Heh, heh, to get something.

1228
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,500
Could Clay Martin,

1229
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:58,500
the sword-like monster who crashed

1230
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:00,500
into the Mushroom Kingdom,

1231
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:02,500
have anything to do with the star piece

1232
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:04,500
that Mario found?

1233
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:06,500
Our heroes moved on towards

1234
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:08,500
the Kero Sewers. Kero Kero.

1235
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:10,500
Kero-chan!

1236
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:20,500
Kero mentioned.

1237
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:32,500
Look, I better not be goofing off.

1238
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:36,500
The actual beginning.

1239
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:38,500
Yeah.

1240
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:40,500
I'm so bad at video games.

1241
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:46,500
Oh!

1242
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:48,500
Oh, now it's

1243
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:50,500
everything's normal again.

1244
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:54,500
Careful, the monster! Smash him all!

1245
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:56,500
Do ya good, trust me on this one.

1246
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,500
I guess the Princess Peach World really was

1247
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:02,500
kidnapped by Bowser.

1248
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:04,500
Hey, Mario, look where you're standing.

1249
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:06,500
Ha, gotcha!

1250
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:08,500
That was too darn close.

1251
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:10,500
Thanks for the hand, Mario.

1252
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:14,500
I'll make a great

1253
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:16,500
sidekick.

1254
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:18,500
Oh, my grandchild turns out

1255
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:20,500
to be just like the Princess.

1256
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:22,500
I'll remain here for the lookout.

1257
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:28,500
Do I need to pick up anything?

1258
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:32,500
I probably need to pick up things, huh?

1259
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:36,500
Hey, Mario,

1260
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:38,500
what kept you out of starting to worry?

1261
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:40,500
Hey, mister, I got my coin back.

1262
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:42,500
Oh, well done, lad.

1263
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:44,500
Okay, here's the thing I promised you.

1264
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:46,500
There, make sure it doesn't get stolen

1265
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:48,500
or whatever, your grandpa needs it, okay?

1266
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:50,500
Got cricket pie.

1267
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:52,500
You bet.

1268
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:54,500
I don't think so much.

1269
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:56,500
Grandpa will be delighted.

1270
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:58,500
I get actual items, thanks.

1271
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:00,500
Okay, I want

1272
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:04,500
some mushrooms.

1273
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:08,500
Some honey pseudo.

1274
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:30,500
Okay, that's good.

1275
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:40,500
Save, I need to save.

1276
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:46,500
I know that it's...

1277
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:48,500
Oops, I know that it auto-saves,

1278
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:50,500
but, you know...

1279
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:00,500
Okay, where do I need to go?

1280
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:02,500
Here?

1281
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:06,500
I think...

1282
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:08,500
Here?

1283
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:12,500
This is the entrance.

1284
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,500
Grandpa says to watch out for bellum.

1285
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:16,500
Well, whatever, whoever that is,

1286
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:18,500
probably a little dark down there, so keep alert.

1287
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:30,500
Haha.

1288
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:34,500
Oh, I have to save here again.

1289
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:38,500
Kiddosuers.

1290
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:42,500
Ooh, I swim.

1291
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:44,500
Ooh, how...

1292
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:46,500
Gross.

1293
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:54,500
Reading directions on how to enter?

1294
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:56,500
Yes.

1295
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:58,500
Stand on pipe, push A.

1296
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:00,500
Do we enter a pipe?

1297
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:02,500
Jump off once and try again.

1298
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:04,500
Okay.

1299
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:14,500
Is there anything around here?

1300
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:24,500
Ah! Freaking rats!

1301
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:26,500
I didn't know Emmy was here.

1302
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:30,500
That Emmy was on vacation.

1303
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:46,500
Fucking rats.

1304
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:56,500
Die!

1305
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:58,500
Freaking rats.

1306
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,500
A lucky...

1307
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:26,500
...

1308
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,500
I am pure water.

1309
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:48,500
I got flour.

1310
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:56,500
Hey!

1311
01:58:56,500 --> 01:58:58,500
Ho-what?

1312
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:00,500
It's a ho-what?

1313
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:14,500
Oh.

1314
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:26,500
Oh, your heart's broken. It's okay.

1315
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:36,500
Don't worry. Don't be scared.

1316
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:38,500
Just a little guy.

1317
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:46,500
The feet's undead in a wink.

1318
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:48,500
Oh, okay.

1319
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:56,500
Okay.

1320
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:58,500
Okay.

1321
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:24,500
Mario gets a fuck back up.

1322
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:28,500
Mario gets a fuck back up.

1323
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:32,500
Mario!

1324
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:58,500
Ah!

1325
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:06,500
Arh!

1326
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:14,500
Mario!

1327
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:20,500
I'm gonna do physical this time.

1328
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:27,500
You won't turn into mushrooms or Scarecrolls.

1329
02:01:50,500 --> 02:02:11,500
Oh, how do I go down?

1330
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:37,500
Oh, shit.

1331
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:50,500
Yeah.

1332
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:56,500
Wait, I unequipped Mario's armor?

1333
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,500
Did I?

1334
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:03,500
Oopsie-daisy!

1335
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:10,500
That was my bad.

1336
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:23,500
Can I beat a Shadow?

1337
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:33,500
Yeah, why not?

1338
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:37,500
Our mushroom!

1339
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:38,500
Thanks!

1340
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:41,500
Oh, attack up, thank you!

1341
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:55,500
Whoa.

1342
02:03:55,500 --> 02:04:02,500
Oh, you can literally just hammer it, okay?

1343
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:06,500
Whoa.

1344
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:24,500
Your HP sucks, but also give me more magic.

1345
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:39,500
Oh, why did it run away?

1346
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:54,500
Hmm.

1347
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:59,500
There's something over there.

1348
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:08,500
Oh.

1349
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:23,500
Oh.

1350
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:32,500
Oh, shit, I'm poisoned.

1351
02:05:38,500 --> 02:06:07,500
My timing's so bad.

1352
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:16,500
What's with this guy and so much HP?

1353
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:21,500
There we go.

1354
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:28,500
Oh, I got a frog coin, that's why.

1355
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:30,500
Right, oh.

1356
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:35,500
Like this? Yeah.

1357
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:40,500
That's right, run!

1358
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:47,500
Oh, you spooked me!

1359
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:57,500
There we go.

1360
02:06:57,500 --> 02:07:04,500
There's a button there.

1361
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:19,500
Water has been drained.

1362
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:23,500
Sorry, it's funny to see these fish on land.

1363
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:32,500
There it is.

1364
02:07:32,500 --> 02:07:41,500
Yeah, I can save here again, yeah.

1365
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:58,500
How do I get up there, though?

1366
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:04,500
Big door, I think there's a switch somewhere.

1367
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:16,500
Giddle, giddle.

1368
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:18,500
That must be film.

1369
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:25,500
Not a fire hose, or his tongue.

1370
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:32,500
Oh, it's snack attacking, you're it!

1371
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:39,500
It's kind of cute, right?

1372
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:48,500
Can I do a fireball on it?

1373
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:54,500
I suck.

1374
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:57,500
Well, room service has been kind to me.

1375
02:08:57,500 --> 02:09:01,500
Where's my bib?

1376
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:22,500
Okay, let's try this again.

1377
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:29,500
I fell asleep.

1378
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:32,500
Stick for a body, and full of straw.

1379
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:46,500
Give me a scarecrow, rah, rah, rah.

1380
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:52,500
I can't, it's hunger, the hunger.

1381
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:57,500
I got it!

1382
02:09:57,500 --> 02:10:05,500
Spin it out!

1383
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:11,500
Bad dog, bang.

1384
02:10:11,500 --> 02:10:25,500
Good. That was scary!

1385
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:35,500
Dump.

1386
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:42,500
Ah!

1387
02:10:42,500 --> 02:11:04,500
I guess I'll defend, right?

1388
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:20,500
Oh, keep defending!

1389
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:33,500
Can you still do this?

1390
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:39,500
You think you won, huh?

1391
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:42,500
Little did you know.

1392
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:45,500
I'm out of stopping of flood water.

1393
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:49,500
So long, Sokies!

1394
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:51,500
Thanks for the money, but also...

1395
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:58,500
What?

1396
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:09,500
That one must have been lying when he said he'd water would come gushing out of here.

1397
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:12,500
Er, Mario, did you hear something, or is it just me?

1398
02:12:12,500 --> 02:12:18,500
Water, here it comes! We need to switch it back before we're washed away!

1399
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:25,500
There's a button right there, can I just... yeah.

1400
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:37,500
Oh! Oh!

1401
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:40,500
I'm in Splash Mountain now!

1402
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:45,500
This is the minus river course.

1403
02:12:45,500 --> 02:12:48,500
What did I have to say?

1404
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:52,500
Water crash course isn't yes.

1405
02:12:52,500 --> 02:13:03,500
To start off, first at the falls, use L to move left or right and squirt coins.

1406
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:10,500
Press V to make a little headway against the flow.

1407
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:15,500
Okay, on the way there are a few holes, as well as what will happen.

1408
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:17,500
Just keep that a surprise.

1409
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:20,500
Off you go!

1410
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:22,500
I can get coins?

1411
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:25,500
Frog coin!

1412
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:28,500
I want my frog coin! Give me my frog coin!

1413
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:30,500
Frog! Frog! Frog! Frog!

1414
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:41,500
Yeah.

1415
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:49,500
Frog, frog, frog, frog, frog coin!

1416
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:59,500
That's most important, right? It's the frog.

1417
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:04,500
Ah! Where's the holes?

1418
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:11,500
It really is like Splash Mountain, except for...

1419
02:14:11,500 --> 02:14:15,500
I don't know.

1420
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:23,500
Oh, by the way...

1421
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:27,500
Sorry, I meant...

1422
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:33,500
Visually distinct Splash Mountain.

1423
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:44,500
Okay, here we go.

1424
02:14:44,500 --> 02:14:49,500
Give me my frog coin!

1425
02:14:49,500 --> 02:14:55,500
Give me the con!

1426
02:14:56,140 --> 02:14:57,200
Rock, coin, coin.

1427
02:14:57,200 --> 02:14:57,940
Rock, coin.

1428
02:14:57,940 --> 02:15:00,220
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock.

1429
02:15:00,220 --> 02:15:01,900
Rock, rock, rock, rock.

1430
02:15:01,900 --> 02:15:03,100
Rock, rock, rock, rock.

1431
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:04,360
Rock, rock, rock, rock.

1432
02:15:04,360 --> 02:15:05,180
Rock, rock, rock.

1433
02:15:05,180 --> 02:15:06,560
Rock.

1434
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:07,060
Cling.

1435
02:15:16,060 --> 02:15:16,660
Whee.

1436
02:15:16,660 --> 02:15:19,120
What's this?

1437
02:15:19,120 --> 02:15:20,620
jetzt we're the bear jumping it.

1438
02:15:20,620 --> 02:15:21,020
No.

1439
02:15:21,020 --> 02:15:22,020
Awww.

1440
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:26,020
Need some pointers?

1441
02:15:26,020 --> 02:15:27,020
Yeah.

1442
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:30,020
I'm gonna jump and grab coins along the way.

1443
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:35,020
Some pies already know how bad I am at platforming.

1444
02:15:38,020 --> 02:15:40,020
I'm going to the next barrel before they collide.

1445
02:15:45,020 --> 02:15:47,020
Is it a new change course?

1446
02:15:48,020 --> 02:15:50,020
Looks like you're ready so I'll send you on your way.

1447
02:15:50,020 --> 02:15:51,020
No, I'm ready.

1448
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:56,020
Almost forgot to tell you, leap over the fish that pop up or you'll lose coin.

1449
02:15:56,020 --> 02:15:58,020
Shut up.

1450
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:11,020
What?

1451
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:22,020
What?

1452
02:16:31,020 --> 02:16:32,020
What?

1453
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:42,020
Oh my god!

1454
02:16:42,020 --> 02:16:43,020
Wait!

1455
02:16:59,020 --> 02:17:00,020
Shut up, bitch!

1456
02:17:13,020 --> 02:17:16,020
Pay the coins you got from Midas River for frog coins.

1457
02:17:29,020 --> 02:17:31,020
That's not enough to cash in so hold on.

1458
02:17:31,020 --> 02:17:33,020
So I'll hold on for them for you, okay?

1459
02:17:34,020 --> 02:17:35,020
Come back and try again.

1460
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:36,020
Just look up.

1461
02:17:36,020 --> 02:17:37,020
Here's something I picked up.

1462
02:17:37,020 --> 02:17:38,020
You can keep it for good luck.

1463
02:17:39,020 --> 02:17:40,020
Fuck Koopa Shell.

1464
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:43,020
Shut the fuck up!

1465
02:17:55,020 --> 02:18:00,020
Okay, let's equip Koopa Shell.

1466
02:18:03,020 --> 02:18:04,020
shirt

1467
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:06,020
pants

1468
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:09,020
pants

1469
02:18:18,020 --> 02:18:20,020
So weapon call high.

1470
02:18:30,020 --> 02:18:32,020
Koopa Shell kicked to attack.

1471
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:39,020
Does Malo not have any?

1472
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:40,020
Should I try it?

1473
02:18:40,020 --> 02:18:42,020
I'll give it a shot.

1474
02:18:45,020 --> 02:18:47,020
What's going on here?

1475
02:18:54,020 --> 02:18:55,020
Melody Bay.

1476
02:18:55,020 --> 02:18:57,020
How do you know it's by jumping on the tadpoles?

1477
02:18:58,020 --> 02:18:59,020
Tadpoles.

1478
02:19:00,020 --> 02:19:01,020
Let's hear your melody.

1479
02:19:02,020 --> 02:19:03,020
I won't play with strangers.

1480
02:19:03,020 --> 02:19:06,020
They won't play with strangers so go and meet this frog sage first.

1481
02:19:06,020 --> 02:19:07,020
Okay.

1482
02:19:09,020 --> 02:19:11,020
Okay, frog sage first.

1483
02:19:11,020 --> 02:19:12,020
Other way.

1484
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:19,020
Hi, can I help you?

1485
02:19:20,020 --> 02:19:21,020
Oh, it's you!

1486
02:19:21,020 --> 02:19:24,020
You've heard about your adventures with Super Mario.

1487
02:19:24,020 --> 02:19:25,020
Meet up Bellum, right?

1488
02:19:26,020 --> 02:19:27,020
You know about that?

1489
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:31,020
Hey Mario, the waterways of the world brings news to us here.

1490
02:19:31,020 --> 02:19:34,020
That's why Grandpa knows all the news that's fit to hear.

1491
02:19:36,020 --> 02:19:38,020
Are you really the Super Mario?

1492
02:19:39,020 --> 02:19:41,020
Hey everyone, you never guess who's here.

1493
02:19:44,020 --> 02:19:45,020
He's the real thing.

1494
02:19:45,020 --> 02:19:47,020
But he doesn't look anything like I thought he would.

1495
02:19:49,020 --> 02:19:51,020
You say you can jump better than a froggy.

1496
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:53,020
I wonder if there's only a rumor?

1497
02:19:57,020 --> 02:19:59,020
I'm so excited!

1498
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:02,020
Wow, wow, what's new?

1499
02:20:03,020 --> 02:20:06,020
You're so excited!

1500
02:20:07,020 --> 02:20:09,020
Grandpa, Mario's been helping me.

1501
02:20:10,020 --> 02:20:12,020
I know a child that's brainstormed.

1502
02:20:12,020 --> 02:20:14,020
We just had algae, wasn't it?

1503
02:20:15,020 --> 02:20:16,020
Ouch.

1504
02:20:16,020 --> 02:20:17,020
Watch it up there.

1505
02:20:17,020 --> 02:20:20,020
It's supposed to make me look like I'm floating here, okay?

1506
02:20:23,020 --> 02:20:28,020
Oh, how, how, how very, how are you sage of you?

1507
02:20:29,020 --> 02:20:32,020
With your, with your frog sage wisdom.

1508
02:20:35,020 --> 02:20:37,020
Welcome, so you are Mario.

1509
02:20:37,020 --> 02:20:39,020
Yes, I am frog sage.

1510
02:20:39,020 --> 02:20:41,020
You have come to seek wisdom from me.

1511
02:20:41,020 --> 02:20:42,020
Have you not?

1512
02:20:42,020 --> 02:20:43,020
I've been waiting for you.

1513
02:20:43,020 --> 02:20:47,020
Yes, old wise people can often give good advice.

1514
02:20:48,020 --> 02:20:51,020
Hey, senpai, since you're so old and wise,

1515
02:20:51,020 --> 02:20:57,020
can you bestow upon your kohai some sage old wisdom?

1516
02:20:58,020 --> 02:21:00,020
Old people knowledge?

1517
02:21:10,020 --> 02:21:12,020
Every 60 seconds a minute passes.

1518
02:21:12,020 --> 02:21:13,020
Thank you.

1519
02:21:16,020 --> 02:21:18,020
Frogfuges, let's go.

1520
02:21:22,020 --> 02:21:25,020
Always look both ways before you cross the road.

1521
02:21:29,020 --> 02:21:34,020
But how rude of me.

1522
02:21:34,020 --> 02:21:36,020
Let me get more comfortable.

1523
02:21:36,020 --> 02:21:38,020
Come along and we'll talk.

1524
02:21:40,020 --> 02:21:43,020
Clear, far, well, full reverse.

1525
02:21:48,020 --> 02:21:50,020
Ted Poles, don't just float there.

1526
02:21:50,020 --> 02:21:51,020
Make yourself useful.

1527
02:21:51,020 --> 02:21:52,020
Form a bridge for Mario.

1528
02:21:59,020 --> 02:22:01,020
I get to use them on the bridge?

1529
02:22:05,020 --> 02:22:09,020
Yes, come into my sanctuary and partake of my wisdom children.

1530
02:22:19,020 --> 02:22:21,020
If a raw egg floats in water, it's rotten.

1531
02:22:21,020 --> 02:22:27,020
I don't even need to know that because I avoid eggs at all costs.

1532
02:22:29,020 --> 02:22:32,020
You kind of need to yourself whether it's buying extra ice cream

1533
02:22:32,020 --> 02:22:34,020
or another Pokemon thing.

1534
02:22:34,020 --> 02:22:36,020
Comparison is a theft of joy and if you're going to compare,

1535
02:22:36,020 --> 02:22:38,020
compare your past progress.

1536
02:22:38,020 --> 02:22:42,020
Now how versus now it's to your girlfriend.

1537
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:44,020
Wow, that one's really wise.

1538
02:22:44,020 --> 02:22:46,020
So wise and sage-like.

1539
02:22:51,020 --> 02:22:52,020
Evil eggs.

1540
02:22:52,020 --> 02:22:56,020
All eggs are evil and should be eradicated.

1541
02:22:58,020 --> 02:22:59,020
Let's see.

1542
02:22:59,020 --> 02:23:02,020
That's Smithy character that appeared at Bowser's Keep.

1543
02:23:02,020 --> 02:23:04,020
He's quite formidable, yes.

1544
02:23:04,020 --> 02:23:07,020
Mario, do we wish to rescue the princess?

1545
02:23:07,020 --> 02:23:08,020
Quickly do not.

1546
02:23:08,020 --> 02:23:12,020
I mean, he always wants to rescue the princess.

1547
02:23:15,020 --> 02:23:17,020
Even your eggs call hi.

1548
02:23:19,020 --> 02:23:20,020
I'm allergic to...

1549
02:23:20,020 --> 02:23:22,020
I'm allergic to...

1550
02:23:25,020 --> 02:23:26,020
What's the word?

1551
02:23:26,020 --> 02:23:27,020
Bird eggs.

1552
02:23:29,020 --> 02:23:32,020
The bird eggs.

1553
02:23:32,020 --> 02:23:34,020
You think I'm a bird?

1554
02:23:42,020 --> 02:23:44,020
Oh, you only knew the truth.

1555
02:23:44,020 --> 02:23:46,020
Peach is no longer there.

1556
02:23:50,020 --> 02:23:52,020
This is dramatic.

1557
02:23:52,020 --> 02:23:54,020
Patience, young one, let me explain.

1558
02:23:54,020 --> 02:23:56,020
Here's what happened.

1559
02:23:59,020 --> 02:24:02,020
You were rescuing Peach from Bowser's Keep

1560
02:24:02,020 --> 02:24:06,020
after defeating him just when you were about to free the princess.

1561
02:24:06,020 --> 02:24:10,020
There was a loud crash and saw a huge sword split the sky.

1562
02:24:12,020 --> 02:24:14,020
Ooh, exactly like that, yes.

1563
02:24:14,020 --> 02:24:17,020
Everyone's so good at charades here.

1564
02:24:18,020 --> 02:24:20,020
Bush out of the blue.

1565
02:24:20,020 --> 02:24:23,020
The shots and the three of you flying.

1566
02:24:23,020 --> 02:24:27,020
Bowser and Peach are lost somewhere out there now.

1567
02:24:28,020 --> 02:24:30,020
You're worried about the princess,

1568
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:32,020
but first you need to take care of Smithy.

1569
02:24:32,020 --> 02:24:35,020
His underlings are wreaking havoc in our world.

1570
02:24:35,020 --> 02:24:38,020
Clay Morton, whom you defeated at the Mushroom Kingdom,

1571
02:24:38,020 --> 02:24:39,020
was one of them.

1572
02:24:39,020 --> 02:24:41,020
More will be coming.

1573
02:24:41,020 --> 02:24:43,020
Grandpa, I almost forgot to tell you something.

1574
02:24:43,020 --> 02:24:46,020
I'm a star in the Mushroom Kingdom castle.

1575
02:24:46,020 --> 02:24:48,020
Do you know why I was there?

1576
02:24:50,020 --> 02:24:51,020
Star, eh?

1577
02:24:51,020 --> 02:24:53,020
Most interesting.

1578
02:24:54,020 --> 02:24:56,020
This may sound illogical,

1579
02:24:56,020 --> 02:24:59,020
but I believe shooting stars can grant wishes.

1580
02:24:59,020 --> 02:25:01,020
And now, more than ever,

1581
02:25:01,020 --> 02:25:06,020
I believe they will play a vital role in the fight against Smithy.

1582
02:25:08,020 --> 02:25:10,020
Not too much to absorb, would you like to recap?

1583
02:25:10,020 --> 02:25:12,020
Oh no, we're good, we're good.

1584
02:25:14,020 --> 02:25:17,020
It's quite a situation we have in our hands, isn't it?

1585
02:25:19,020 --> 02:25:23,020
Wow, everything sounds so dire and serious.

1586
02:25:23,020 --> 02:25:25,020
I guess Clay Morton was real.

1587
02:25:25,020 --> 02:25:27,020
Only the first of many, Mario.

1588
02:25:27,020 --> 02:25:31,020
Some of them make Bowser seem nice.

1589
02:25:31,020 --> 02:25:35,020
Mario, you speak as if these things cannot concern you.

1590
02:25:35,020 --> 02:25:37,020
You accompany Mario on his adventure too.

1591
02:25:39,020 --> 02:25:41,020
Grandpa, what are you talking about?

1592
02:25:41,020 --> 02:25:45,020
I'm only a simple tadpole, this adventure isn't for me.

1593
02:25:46,020 --> 02:25:51,020
Mario, my boy.

1594
02:25:51,020 --> 02:25:53,020
Mallowa, my boy.

1595
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:55,020
I've kept this from you until now,

1596
02:25:55,020 --> 02:25:58,020
but you're not a tadpole.

1597
02:26:00,020 --> 02:26:02,020
Say what?

1598
02:26:06,020 --> 02:26:08,020
Whoa!

1599
02:26:08,020 --> 02:26:10,020
What do you mean?

1600
02:26:10,020 --> 02:26:13,020
I can't believe it, no way!

1601
02:26:15,020 --> 02:26:22,020
I was sitting here one rainy day,

1602
02:26:22,020 --> 02:26:24,020
enjoying a snack of crickets.

1603
02:26:26,020 --> 02:26:28,020
We can't believe it, Senpai!

1604
02:26:28,020 --> 02:26:30,020
Who could have seen this coming?

1605
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:36,020
When I happened to see basket floating down from the falls,

1606
02:26:36,020 --> 02:26:40,020
I peeked inside and saw a little baby staring right back at me.

1607
02:26:40,020 --> 02:26:43,020
Name, Mallow, was written on his belt.

1608
02:26:43,020 --> 02:26:45,020
I felt sorry for the little bundle of puff,

1609
02:26:45,020 --> 02:26:49,020
and took him in to raise it as my own grandchild.

1610
02:26:49,020 --> 02:26:53,020
And powerful magic, and I knew he was more than a piece of fluff.

1611
02:26:53,020 --> 02:26:58,020
I thought surely this child must be from some far off land.

1612
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:02,020
Grandpa, you mean it?

1613
02:27:02,020 --> 02:27:04,020
I'm not a tadpole!

1614
02:27:04,020 --> 02:27:06,020
Mallowa!

1615
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:12,020
Mallowa!

1616
02:27:12,020 --> 02:27:14,020
Now is not the time to cry.

1617
02:27:14,020 --> 02:27:16,020
Go with Mario on his adventure,

1618
02:27:16,020 --> 02:27:19,020
and find your real family.

1619
02:27:19,020 --> 02:27:23,020
Your real mother and father are out there, so where?

1620
02:27:25,020 --> 02:27:27,020
Mario.

1621
02:27:27,020 --> 02:27:30,020
Boy's magic is sure to come in handy on your adventure.

1622
02:27:30,020 --> 02:27:32,020
Take him along, right?

1623
02:27:33,020 --> 02:27:35,020
Oh!

1624
02:27:36,020 --> 02:27:39,020
Grandpa, I won't cry anymore.

1625
02:27:39,020 --> 02:27:44,020
I'll go on this adventure with Mario, and find my real family.

1626
02:27:44,020 --> 02:27:46,020
And it's settled.

1627
02:27:46,020 --> 02:27:49,020
You must embark on your adventure immediately.

1628
02:27:49,020 --> 02:27:52,020
First, go to Rose Town, and I need your help.

1629
02:27:54,020 --> 02:27:56,020
Are you okay?

1630
02:27:58,020 --> 02:28:00,020
I'll be quieter.

1631
02:28:00,020 --> 02:28:03,020
It will be quiet around here with my Mallowa gone.

1632
02:28:03,020 --> 02:28:05,020
Give me a snack, would hear me out.

1633
02:28:05,020 --> 02:28:07,020
That's right, I forgot about it!

1634
02:28:07,020 --> 02:28:09,020
I gave me some of the Cricket Pie you brought back.

1635
02:28:09,020 --> 02:28:12,020
I will give you something for the Cricket Pie you brought back.

1636
02:28:12,020 --> 02:28:13,020
I know.

1637
02:28:13,020 --> 02:28:16,020
You shall have the staff I used when I was Mallow's age.

1638
02:28:17,020 --> 02:28:19,020
The Froggy Stick will come in handy.

1639
02:28:19,020 --> 02:28:21,020
Do not forget to equip it.

1640
02:28:24,020 --> 02:28:26,020
Okay, he's okay again!

1641
02:28:27,020 --> 02:28:29,020
I'll keep sticking.

1642
02:28:32,020 --> 02:28:34,020
Go to Rose Town, luck be with you.

1643
02:28:36,020 --> 02:28:43,020
Sounds, laughter, mirth, reverie, donuts, reading, dolphin, relax.

1644
02:28:43,020 --> 02:28:46,020
A few notes on my latest tune.

1645
02:28:47,020 --> 02:28:48,020
Hold on.

1646
02:28:49,020 --> 02:28:51,020
Do I need to write this down?

1647
02:28:51,020 --> 02:28:54,020
Senpai, do I need to write this down?

1648
02:28:56,020 --> 02:29:03,020
Sounds, laughter, mirth, reverie, donuts, reading.

1649
02:29:05,020 --> 02:29:06,020
Pinch show.

1650
02:29:08,020 --> 02:29:09,020
Pinch show.

1651
02:29:10,020 --> 02:29:11,020
No, not Pippa.

1652
02:29:21,020 --> 02:29:22,020
Not Pippa.

1653
02:29:26,020 --> 02:29:27,020
Not Pippa.

1654
02:29:27,020 --> 02:29:28,020
Not Pippa.

1655
02:29:55,020 --> 02:29:56,020
There we go.

1656
02:29:57,020 --> 02:29:58,020
Not Pippa.

1657
02:30:03,020 --> 02:30:04,020
Your table, it's mine.

1658
02:30:08,020 --> 02:30:09,020
Okay.

1659
02:30:10,020 --> 02:30:12,020
And I get the fuck out of here.

1660
02:30:12,020 --> 02:30:13,020
Okay, there we go.

1661
02:30:16,020 --> 02:30:18,020
Thanks tadpoles.

1662
02:30:23,020 --> 02:30:25,020
It's a me, Merciel.

1663
02:30:27,020 --> 02:30:29,020
Got in this dream of becoming a composer.

1664
02:30:29,020 --> 02:30:33,020
Maybe as famous as Tawatsuki.

1665
02:30:33,020 --> 02:30:35,020
My favorite song?

1666
02:30:35,020 --> 02:30:38,020
Frog Sage, sweet number...

1667
02:30:39,020 --> 02:30:40,020
Number 18.

1668
02:30:40,020 --> 02:30:44,020
Solami de do, do de do de.

1669
02:30:44,020 --> 02:30:47,020
Tawatsuki's fond of it too.

1670
02:30:58,020 --> 02:30:59,020
Oh!

1671
02:31:06,020 --> 02:31:07,020
You see.

1672
02:31:18,020 --> 02:31:20,020
That's something you can pose.

1673
02:31:21,020 --> 02:31:23,020
No, that's not the right melody.

1674
02:31:23,020 --> 02:31:24,020
That's not the right melody.

1675
02:31:31,020 --> 02:31:32,020
Give me a second.

1676
02:31:36,020 --> 02:31:37,020
How does this work?

1677
02:31:39,020 --> 02:31:40,020
You, speak to me.

1678
02:31:41,020 --> 02:31:42,020
Favorite song?

1679
02:31:46,020 --> 02:31:52,020
Solami de do, do de do de.

1680
02:31:53,020 --> 02:32:03,020
Tawatsuki de do, do de do de.

1681
02:32:03,020 --> 02:32:05,020
Do I have to mention those?

1682
02:32:06,020 --> 02:32:08,020
I don't know which way it goes.

1683
02:32:12,020 --> 02:32:13,020
Sol?

1684
02:32:24,020 --> 02:32:25,020
Wait, what?

1685
02:32:31,020 --> 02:32:36,020
Solami de do, do de do de.

1686
02:32:54,020 --> 02:32:55,020
Oh.

1687
02:33:02,020 --> 02:33:04,020
Wait, did I fuck up?

1688
02:33:05,020 --> 02:33:06,020
Oh fuck.

1689
02:33:17,020 --> 02:33:18,020
My bad.

1690
02:33:23,020 --> 02:33:31,020
No, it's missing fa.

1691
02:33:31,020 --> 02:33:32,020
Okay.

1692
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:36,020
I can't, I don't know music very well.

1693
02:33:40,020 --> 02:33:41,020
Okay, hold on.

1694
02:33:45,020 --> 02:33:49,020
Do de do, do de do.

1695
02:33:49,020 --> 02:33:50,020
No, do?

1696
02:33:50,020 --> 02:33:51,020
Sol?

1697
02:33:52,020 --> 02:33:54,020
I can talk to him again.

1698
02:33:57,020 --> 02:33:59,020
Just decide to go like this.

1699
02:34:00,020 --> 02:34:01,020
Yeah, straight line.

1700
02:34:15,020 --> 02:34:17,020
And the composer, Tawatsuki.

1701
02:34:17,020 --> 02:34:20,020
And you create my next next piece, but I got composer's block.

1702
02:34:21,020 --> 02:34:22,020
Want a music lesson from me?

1703
02:34:22,020 --> 02:34:23,020
Yes!

1704
02:34:24,020 --> 02:34:25,020
Let's start by reading notes.

1705
02:34:25,020 --> 02:34:26,020
See the five lines?

1706
02:34:29,020 --> 02:34:34,020
Between the second and third lines from the top lies do.

1707
02:34:35,020 --> 02:34:36,020
Do.

1708
02:34:37,020 --> 02:34:38,020
Like this one?

1709
02:34:39,020 --> 02:34:43,020
Keep going from do, re, mi.

1710
02:34:47,020 --> 02:34:52,020
Ti, la, so, fa.

1711
02:34:54,020 --> 02:34:56,020
Oh my gosh.

1712
02:34:57,020 --> 02:34:58,020
Hold on.

1713
02:34:59,020 --> 02:35:00,020
Going up.

1714
02:35:09,020 --> 02:35:10,020
Do de mi.

1715
02:35:10,020 --> 02:35:17,020
Ti, la, so, fa.

1716
02:35:22,020 --> 02:35:23,020
Okay.

1717
02:35:23,020 --> 02:35:27,020
Do de mi, ti, la, so, fa.

1718
02:35:27,020 --> 02:35:29,020
This doesn't seem right.

1719
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:36,020
You're on your way to composing.

1720
02:35:40,020 --> 02:35:42,020
Okay.

1721
02:36:10,020 --> 02:36:26,020
Oh shit, I think I did it wrong.

1722
02:36:35,020 --> 02:36:37,020
That's remarkably similar to what I have in mind.

1723
02:36:38,020 --> 02:36:40,020
I'm so close!

1724
02:36:40,020 --> 02:36:41,020
I was really close!

1725
02:36:53,020 --> 02:36:54,020
Okay, okay.

1726
02:36:54,020 --> 02:36:55,020
Hold on.

1727
02:37:00,020 --> 02:37:01,020
Do de mi.

1728
02:37:02,020 --> 02:37:03,020
Okay.

1729
02:37:04,020 --> 02:37:05,020
Do de mi.

1730
02:37:06,020 --> 02:37:07,020
Do de mi.

1731
02:37:07,020 --> 02:37:08,020
This one.

1732
02:37:14,020 --> 02:37:15,020
Why?

1733
02:37:23,020 --> 02:37:24,020
Ti.

1734
02:37:24,020 --> 02:37:29,940
Mother was also trying to believe her father was realistic capacity.

1735
02:37:29,940 --> 02:37:37,540
Clearly, it's almost impossible to say that I and her mother were speaking their native language.

1736
02:37:37,540 --> 02:37:49,640
That's not going to work without us.

1737
02:37:49,640 --> 02:37:54,640
May I again? Yeah. Day.

1738
02:38:05,640 --> 02:38:10,640
That's it! This is the melody I've been looking for. Thank you for the inspiration.

1739
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:12,640
Please take this as a token of my gratitude.

1740
02:38:12,640 --> 02:38:14,640
Got the Alto card.

1741
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:18,640
You ever need help with my composition again? I'll look for you here.

1742
02:38:18,640 --> 02:38:20,640
Until then, edgy.

1743
02:38:24,640 --> 02:38:26,640
Yay! Let's go!

1744
02:38:39,640 --> 02:38:41,640
You look fun.

1745
02:38:41,640 --> 02:38:43,640
See what that toad says.

1746
02:38:44,640 --> 02:38:47,640
Can't wait to graduate from music school and start composing.

1747
02:38:47,640 --> 02:38:51,640
Thank you, wise toad.

1748
02:39:01,640 --> 02:39:06,640
Head up north from the exit to find where you used the card. Here?

1749
02:39:06,640 --> 02:39:08,640
Okay.

1750
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:18,640
Go back and turn right.

1751
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:24,640
Wait, shouldn't we look into how to use the fraud coins?

1752
02:39:27,640 --> 02:39:30,640
Oh yeah, maybe we should do that.

1753
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:32,640
What?

1754
02:39:32,640 --> 02:39:36,640
Welcome to Fraud Coin and Brorium. Hey, the first timer, aren't you? Listen up.

1755
02:39:36,640 --> 02:39:39,640
The green coins you find periodically are fraud coins.

1756
02:39:39,640 --> 02:39:43,640
You can lay them and buy items at tadpole pond.

1757
02:39:43,640 --> 02:39:45,640
Sleepy bomb.

1758
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:48,640
Bracer.

1759
02:39:49,640 --> 02:39:51,640
Energizer.

1760
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:54,640
Cardi-bracer.

1761
02:39:56,640 --> 02:39:58,640
Cardi-energizer.

1762
02:40:03,640 --> 02:40:05,640
Sleepy bomb.

1763
02:40:06,640 --> 02:40:08,640
Might be handy.

1764
02:40:11,640 --> 02:40:13,640
Welcome to Juice Bar.

1765
02:40:13,640 --> 02:40:15,640
You're a card member?

1766
02:40:15,640 --> 02:40:18,640
Even Tomatsuki has a membership here.

1767
02:40:18,640 --> 02:40:20,640
Ah, an Alto card.

1768
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:22,640
Alto card.

1769
02:40:22,640 --> 02:40:24,640
Alto card.

1770
02:40:24,640 --> 02:40:26,640
What would you like?

1771
02:40:26,640 --> 02:40:28,640
Goodbye.

1772
02:40:28,640 --> 02:40:30,640
Tadpole.

1773
02:40:30,640 --> 02:40:32,640
Tadpole.

1774
02:40:32,640 --> 02:40:34,640
Tadpole cola.

1775
02:40:34,640 --> 02:40:36,640
Ooh.

1776
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:40,640
Frogleg cola.

1777
02:40:47,640 --> 02:40:49,640
Oh, God.

1778
02:40:49,640 --> 02:40:51,640
Free of those.

1779
02:40:55,640 --> 02:40:57,640
Free of those. Yeah.

1780
02:40:58,640 --> 02:41:01,640
What leg cola? Frogleg cola.

1781
02:41:09,640 --> 02:41:11,640
What's this? Look.

1782
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:13,640
Yellow.

1783
02:41:13,640 --> 02:41:15,640
Tiles on Mc Lake Harry.

1784
02:41:15,640 --> 02:41:17,640
And you hop on them.

1785
02:41:17,640 --> 02:41:19,640
You can't jump off a tile when it's blue.

1786
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:21,640
Oh.

1787
02:41:21,640 --> 02:41:23,640
I accidentally won't walk out.

1788
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:30,640
Oh.

1789
02:41:48,640 --> 02:41:50,640
Thank you.

1790
02:41:57,640 --> 02:41:59,640
Bye.

1791
02:42:00,640 --> 02:42:02,640
Star slap.

1792
02:42:07,640 --> 02:42:09,640
Oh.

1793
02:42:11,640 --> 02:42:13,640
Slap the star.

1794
02:42:13,640 --> 02:42:15,640
Oh.

1795
02:42:18,640 --> 02:42:21,640
No, I don't want to be slapped.

1796
02:42:21,640 --> 02:42:23,640
Oh.

1797
02:42:25,640 --> 02:42:28,640
I like the hammer better, guys.

1798
02:42:35,640 --> 02:42:37,640
Lullaby.

1799
02:42:39,640 --> 02:42:44,640
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

1800
02:42:51,640 --> 02:42:53,640
Oh, fuck.

1801
02:42:53,640 --> 02:42:55,640
My.

1802
02:42:55,640 --> 02:42:57,640
My.

1803
02:42:57,640 --> 02:42:59,640
Oh, fuck.

1804
02:42:59,640 --> 02:43:01,640
My.

1805
02:43:01,640 --> 02:43:03,640
Fuck.

1806
02:43:03,640 --> 02:43:05,640
I got so bright.

1807
02:43:05,640 --> 02:43:07,640
My.

1808
02:43:07,640 --> 02:43:09,640
Yeah.

1809
02:43:11,640 --> 02:43:13,640
Yeah.

1810
02:43:13,640 --> 02:43:15,640
Fuck.

1811
02:43:15,640 --> 02:43:17,640
Fuck.

1812
02:43:17,640 --> 02:43:19,640
Fuck.

1813
02:43:19,640 --> 02:43:31,360
Oh, look, hey, listen here, that's a big ass splitter!

1814
02:43:31,660 --> 02:43:34,660
Was that supposed to be the same?

1815
02:43:36,340 --> 02:43:41,620
Friday with fire!

1816
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:50,520
Well, he's got the numpad in his pocket...

1817
02:43:52,860 --> 02:43:53,060
Bro!

1818
02:43:53,580 --> 02:43:55,580
Wait, what are you doing here??

1819
02:43:55,580 --> 02:43:57,080
Oooh!

1820
02:43:59,220 --> 02:44:00,940
Girl, disgusting!

1821
02:44:18,360 --> 02:44:19,980
Yo!

1822
02:44:25,580 --> 02:44:47,580
You grills, grills, grills, disgusting, you grills.

1823
02:44:47,580 --> 02:44:52,580
Oh my gosh, how much?

1824
02:44:53,580 --> 02:45:02,580
Oh, there we go.

1825
02:45:02,580 --> 02:45:12,580
Oh, give me a second.

1826
02:45:12,580 --> 02:45:17,580
Oh, am I not strong enough?

1827
02:45:17,580 --> 02:45:27,580
Ugh. Jesus.

1828
02:45:27,580 --> 02:45:33,580
I'm gonna learn! I'm going to learn how to do this, Senpai.

1829
02:45:33,580 --> 02:45:42,580
The hardest boss in the game. I'm terrible at platformers.

1830
02:45:42,580 --> 02:45:49,580
I just only need to jump on the other one like this one.

1831
02:45:49,580 --> 02:45:51,580
Aw.

1832
02:45:51,580 --> 02:45:57,580
Ehh.

1833
02:45:57,580 --> 02:46:13,580
Ehh.

1834
02:46:13,580 --> 02:46:26,580
Ehh.

1835
02:46:26,580 --> 02:46:30,580
Blah.

1836
02:46:30,580 --> 02:46:44,580
I think I should go right here.

1837
02:46:44,580 --> 02:46:57,580
No.

1838
02:46:57,580 --> 02:47:06,580
Shhh. Close. Close your eyes, Senpai.

1839
02:47:06,580 --> 02:47:24,580
Close your eyes, Senpai.

1840
02:47:24,580 --> 02:47:29,580
Close your eyes, Senpai.

1841
02:47:29,580 --> 02:47:33,580
Yes!

1842
02:47:33,580 --> 02:47:45,580
Okay, now I'm back to being bad at video games.

1843
02:47:45,580 --> 02:47:54,580
Thank you. No! Can't get me back here!

1844
02:47:54,580 --> 02:47:59,580
Fuck.

1845
02:48:15,580 --> 02:48:26,580
Ehh.

1846
02:48:26,580 --> 02:48:35,580
Okay.

1847
02:48:45,580 --> 02:48:55,580
Ah.

1848
02:48:55,580 --> 02:49:05,580
Ah.

1849
02:49:05,580 --> 02:49:15,580
I'm your twerp.

1850
02:49:15,580 --> 02:49:25,580
Blah!

1851
02:49:25,580 --> 02:49:54,580
Okay. I got it.

1852
02:49:54,580 --> 02:50:07,580
Now does seem stronger, yeah.

1853
02:50:07,580 --> 02:50:23,580
Alright. Right, sorry.

1854
02:50:23,580 --> 02:50:37,580
No, I missed!

1855
02:50:37,580 --> 02:50:48,580
Aw, come on.

1856
02:50:48,580 --> 02:50:58,580
There you go.

1857
02:50:58,580 --> 02:51:17,580
Whee! I still need to do timing for, oh fuck.

1858
02:51:17,580 --> 02:51:24,580
Meow.

1859
02:51:24,580 --> 02:51:35,580
Hm?

1860
02:51:35,580 --> 02:51:45,580
Ehh.

1861
02:51:45,580 --> 02:51:55,580
Ehh.

1862
02:51:55,580 --> 02:52:05,580
Ehh.

1863
02:52:05,580 --> 02:52:15,580
Ehh.

1864
02:52:16,580 --> 02:52:43,580
Meow.

1865
02:52:43,580 --> 02:52:55,580
Aw, missed.

1866
02:52:55,580 --> 02:53:05,580
Are they gonna be both asleep now?

1867
02:53:05,580 --> 02:53:14,580
No!

1868
02:53:14,580 --> 02:53:17,580
I'll have one more pick me up.

1869
02:53:17,580 --> 02:53:30,580
Alive!

1870
02:53:30,580 --> 02:53:34,580
Oh, Mario! Stop being the honkshoos!

1871
02:53:34,580 --> 02:53:45,580
Stop me-me-me-me!

1872
02:53:45,580 --> 02:53:59,580
Oh my god.

1873
02:53:59,580 --> 02:54:19,580
They're co-easy!

1874
02:54:19,580 --> 02:54:23,580
One more, one more.

1875
02:54:23,580 --> 02:54:33,580
Guess I can train here.

1876
02:54:33,580 --> 02:55:02,580
There you go.

1877
02:55:02,580 --> 02:55:11,580
Okay, those were easy to block, I could hear it.

1878
02:55:11,580 --> 02:55:17,580
I could hear the melody.

1879
02:55:17,580 --> 02:55:23,580
Yeah.

1880
02:55:23,580 --> 02:55:45,580
Wait, they didn't give me anything.

1881
02:55:45,580 --> 02:56:09,580
Okay.

1882
02:56:09,580 --> 02:56:36,580
Ehh.

1883
02:56:36,580 --> 02:56:57,580
I'm winning!

1884
02:56:57,580 --> 02:57:02,580
Level six, super jump!

1885
02:57:02,580 --> 02:57:10,580
I want more physical.

1886
02:57:10,580 --> 02:57:16,580
Yeah.

1887
02:57:16,580 --> 02:57:19,580
There's just so much.

1888
02:57:19,580 --> 02:57:26,580
Well, time to level up.

1889
02:57:26,580 --> 02:57:36,580
Yeah.

1890
02:57:36,580 --> 02:57:55,580
Oh shit.

1891
02:57:56,580 --> 02:57:58,580
Yeah.

1892
02:57:58,580 --> 02:58:00,580
Yeah, I'm getting it.

1893
02:58:00,580 --> 02:58:12,580
I'm getting it.

1894
02:58:12,580 --> 02:58:41,580
Yeah, I'm getting it.

1895
02:58:41,580 --> 02:59:05,580
Do-do-do-do-do-do.

1896
02:59:05,580 --> 02:59:12,580
Come here.

1897
02:59:12,580 --> 02:59:38,580
My timing's off now.

1898
02:59:38,580 --> 02:59:50,580
I need a mushroom for this biatch.

1899
02:59:50,580 --> 02:59:53,580
Yeah!

1900
02:59:53,580 --> 02:59:58,580
Level up!

1901
02:59:58,580 --> 02:59:59,580
More magic.

1902
02:59:59,580 --> 03:00:09,580
Yes!

1903
03:00:09,580 --> 03:00:16,580
Yeah.

1904
03:00:16,580 --> 03:00:32,580
Going on here.

1905
03:00:32,580 --> 03:00:34,580
Those are so cute though.

1906
03:00:34,580 --> 03:00:36,580
Alright people, form ranks!

1907
03:00:36,580 --> 03:00:43,580
Jaeger, head of the shooting warrior.

1908
03:00:43,580 --> 03:00:49,580
This is a Koopa master of the hooded sorcerers.

1909
03:00:49,580 --> 03:00:53,580
And last but not least, Goom Hilda.

1910
03:00:53,580 --> 03:01:00,580
Grand Dame of the grounding Goombas.

1911
03:01:00,580 --> 03:01:02,580
This is our finest moment.

1912
03:01:02,580 --> 03:01:04,580
Bowser's minions are invincible.

1913
03:01:04,580 --> 03:01:10,580
We shall be victorious.

1914
03:01:10,580 --> 03:01:13,580
The bridge is down, but we'll find a way to get back in.

1915
03:01:13,580 --> 03:01:23,580
Move out on the double!

1916
03:01:23,580 --> 03:01:26,580
Bowser and his minions must be on their way to Bowser's keep.

1917
03:01:26,580 --> 03:01:39,580
Come on, Rosetown is just up ahead.

1918
03:01:39,580 --> 03:01:44,580
Is this Rosetown?

1919
03:01:44,580 --> 03:01:46,580
Wait, is he going to attack Rosetown?

1920
03:01:46,580 --> 03:01:48,580
No!

1921
03:01:48,580 --> 03:01:50,580
Wait, you okay?

1922
03:01:50,580 --> 03:01:53,580
The arrow's coming out from the forest and when you're hit you can't move.

1923
03:01:53,580 --> 03:01:55,580
See, look, can't move a muscle.

1924
03:01:55,580 --> 03:02:00,580
Now I know how a scarecrow feels.

1925
03:02:00,580 --> 03:02:02,580
This is the day a shooting star fell into the forest.

1926
03:02:02,580 --> 03:02:07,580
The arrows have been showering our town.

1927
03:02:07,580 --> 03:02:13,580
Now you can't move.

1928
03:02:13,580 --> 03:02:16,580
Mario, help!

1929
03:02:16,580 --> 03:02:22,580
Hey Mario, I'll be taking care of the princess now.

1930
03:02:22,580 --> 03:02:27,580
Boing boing! Super jump attack!

1931
03:02:27,580 --> 03:02:29,580
They're kissing.

1932
03:02:29,580 --> 03:02:32,580
Oh, they kissed.

1933
03:02:32,580 --> 03:02:38,580
You think you can hurt me with your childish pranks?

1934
03:02:38,580 --> 03:02:40,580
Attention, Peach.

1935
03:02:40,580 --> 03:02:42,580
Attention, Peach, you're coming with me.

1936
03:02:42,580 --> 03:02:44,580
Zip your lip.

1937
03:02:44,580 --> 03:02:52,580
Help, help, somebody help, please help me.

1938
03:02:52,580 --> 03:02:56,580
Oh my gosh.

1939
03:02:56,580 --> 03:02:58,580
It's mom, mom.

1940
03:02:58,580 --> 03:03:02,580
Mom, mom, we have a guest.

1941
03:03:02,580 --> 03:03:04,580
Yes, dear, I hear you.

1942
03:03:04,580 --> 03:03:14,580
Why, hello, why aren't you Mario?

1943
03:03:14,580 --> 03:03:18,580
Priya?

1944
03:03:18,580 --> 03:03:22,580
Oh, you have the hat and the funky stash.

1945
03:03:22,580 --> 03:03:24,580
Are you really Mario?

1946
03:03:24,580 --> 03:03:34,580
You betcha on a wrong number.

1947
03:03:34,580 --> 03:03:36,580
Are you betcha?

1948
03:03:36,580 --> 03:03:39,580
Wrong number.

1949
03:03:39,580 --> 03:03:41,580
Okay, where are you betcha?

1950
03:03:41,580 --> 03:03:45,580
I'm gonna say you betcha.

1951
03:03:45,580 --> 03:03:47,580
But I know it's you.

1952
03:03:47,580 --> 03:03:48,580
You might be pulling my leg.

1953
03:03:48,580 --> 03:03:51,580
Show me, prove it.

1954
03:03:51,580 --> 03:03:53,580
Alright, hey Mario, wanna play with me?

1955
03:03:53,580 --> 03:03:58,580
I'm playing Save the World.

1956
03:03:58,580 --> 03:04:01,580
Now, guys, Mario might be a little tired, dear.

1957
03:04:01,580 --> 03:04:04,580
Oh, come on, mom, you never play with me.

1958
03:04:04,580 --> 03:04:07,580
It's no fun playing alone.

1959
03:04:07,580 --> 03:04:09,580
Oh dear Mario, I hate to ask,

1960
03:04:09,580 --> 03:04:14,580
but could you play with guys for a little while?

1961
03:04:14,580 --> 03:04:17,580
Yes, Mario, just bought the farm,

1962
03:04:17,580 --> 03:04:19,580
so I'll be Bowser.

1963
03:04:19,580 --> 03:04:22,580
I'll be Gino, okay?

1964
03:04:22,580 --> 03:04:26,580
Ready, let's play for Mario let's go.

1965
03:04:26,580 --> 03:04:29,580
Oh, scary, but just watch me.

1966
03:04:29,580 --> 03:04:31,580
Oh, hey, this is the character

1967
03:04:31,580 --> 03:04:34,580
that all the Smash people keep on talking about.

1968
03:04:34,580 --> 03:04:41,580
The emo Pinocchio.

1969
03:04:41,580 --> 03:04:47,580
I remember every time they had like a Smash, like,

1970
03:04:47,580 --> 03:04:54,580
like, event.

1971
03:04:54,580 --> 03:04:59,580
Every single person who's a fan of this would go berserk.

1972
03:04:59,580 --> 03:05:06,580
They would go berserk.

1973
03:05:06,580 --> 03:05:08,580
Better watch out Bowser, cause Gino.

1974
03:05:08,580 --> 03:05:10,580
Gino?

1975
03:05:10,580 --> 03:05:11,580
Gino?

1976
03:05:11,580 --> 03:05:12,580
Gino.

1977
03:05:12,580 --> 03:05:13,580
Gino.

1978
03:05:13,580 --> 03:05:16,580
Gino?

1979
03:05:16,580 --> 03:05:18,580
Gino.

1980
03:05:18,580 --> 03:05:19,580
Gino.

1981
03:05:19,580 --> 03:05:21,580
Gino.

1982
03:05:21,580 --> 03:05:23,580
Gino.

1983
03:05:23,580 --> 03:05:24,580
Gino.

1984
03:05:24,580 --> 03:05:25,580
Gino.

1985
03:05:25,580 --> 03:05:27,580
Gino.

1986
03:05:27,580 --> 03:05:28,580
Now it's like, guy, oh, shut up.

1987
03:05:28,580 --> 03:05:35,580
Don't you know.

1988
03:05:35,580 --> 03:05:37,580
Gino.

1989
03:05:37,580 --> 03:05:38,580
Gino.

1990
03:05:38,580 --> 03:05:39,580
Gino.

1991
03:05:39,580 --> 03:05:40,580
Gino.

1992
03:05:40,580 --> 03:05:41,580
Gino.

1993
03:05:41,580 --> 03:05:46,580
You're a turn, Bowser.

1994
03:05:46,580 --> 03:05:47,580
Ow!

1995
03:05:47,580 --> 03:05:50,580
Oh no, if he keeps this up, I'm finished.

1996
03:05:50,580 --> 03:05:52,580
Alright, you ask for it.

1997
03:05:52,580 --> 03:05:54,580
Super, duper!

1998
03:05:54,580 --> 03:05:58,580
Custom pat new one and only shooting star shot!

1999
03:05:58,580 --> 03:05:59,580
Oh!

2000
03:05:59,580 --> 03:06:02,580
Oops, I, uh, I think I missed.

2001
03:06:02,580 --> 03:06:04,580
Oh dear, oh my.

2002
03:06:04,580 --> 03:06:08,580
Mario, are you alright?

2003
03:06:09,580 --> 03:06:10,580
Oh.

2004
03:06:12,580 --> 03:06:13,580
Damn.

2005
03:06:22,580 --> 03:06:23,580
Here he is!

2006
03:06:23,580 --> 03:06:24,580
The emo!

2007
03:06:24,580 --> 03:06:26,580
The emo Pinocchio!

2008
03:06:38,580 --> 03:06:50,580
Get in the Pinocchio!

2009
03:07:08,580 --> 03:07:18,580
He's a real boy now.

2010
03:07:18,580 --> 03:07:21,580
Look, I'm a real boy.

2011
03:07:32,580 --> 03:07:34,580
Give me crickets.

2012
03:07:34,580 --> 03:07:37,580
I'm your, I'm your conscious.

2013
03:07:37,580 --> 03:07:42,580
Look at me.

2014
03:07:42,580 --> 03:07:43,580
Look at me.

2015
03:07:43,580 --> 03:07:44,580
Pop!

2016
03:07:46,580 --> 03:07:47,580
Wee.

2017
03:07:54,580 --> 03:07:56,580
Oh, yeah, let's save this.

2018
03:07:58,580 --> 03:08:01,580
I drank, I drank some tea.

2019
03:08:04,580 --> 03:08:06,580
But I'm still sleepy.

2020
03:08:06,580 --> 03:08:07,580
Mom!

2021
03:08:07,580 --> 03:08:10,580
You'll never believe what I just saw.

2022
03:08:10,580 --> 03:08:12,580
It's amazing, Mom.

2023
03:08:12,580 --> 03:08:15,580
I just saw Kino walk into the forest, neat, huh?

2024
03:08:15,580 --> 03:08:17,580
Yes, dear, that's nice, dear.

2025
03:08:17,580 --> 03:08:20,580
Didn't you know the one who broke my lap the other day?

2026
03:08:20,580 --> 03:08:25,580
Aw, Mom, that was just, well, you know, now this was real.

2027
03:08:29,580 --> 03:08:32,580
I swear, Mom, it's really true.

2028
03:08:32,580 --> 03:08:34,580
I saw him outside.

2029
03:08:34,580 --> 03:08:36,580
All right, guys, let's hear it.

2030
03:08:36,580 --> 03:08:39,580
What are you trying to get out of this time?

2031
03:08:41,580 --> 03:08:43,580
Um, I didn't do anything.

2032
03:08:43,580 --> 03:08:46,580
I really, truly saw Kino walk into the forest.

2033
03:08:52,580 --> 03:08:54,580
Sorry I knocked you down a while ago.

2034
03:08:54,580 --> 03:08:56,580
Kino doesn't know his own spin.

2035
03:08:58,580 --> 03:09:01,580
Oh, boy, this is incredible.

2036
03:09:01,580 --> 03:09:03,580
Oh, boy, this is impossible.

2037
03:09:03,580 --> 03:09:13,580
Okay, well, I guess we go out and check things out.

2038
03:09:13,580 --> 03:09:15,580
Oh, this is not good.

2039
03:09:15,580 --> 03:09:18,580
Now I can't go into the forest to chop any wood.

2040
03:09:18,580 --> 03:09:21,580
I'm just going to go into people's houses now.

2041
03:09:21,580 --> 03:09:23,580
My husband still hasn't come back.

2042
03:09:23,580 --> 03:09:25,580
I swear, what's keeping him?

2043
03:09:32,580 --> 03:09:34,580
I tell you, it's scary out here.

2044
03:09:34,580 --> 03:09:36,580
Someone's got to pump the water.

2045
03:09:44,580 --> 03:09:46,580
I'm about to pump in some water for us.

2046
03:09:46,580 --> 03:09:48,580
I wish we could help too.

2047
03:09:48,580 --> 03:09:50,580
It turns out to go outside is dangerous.

2048
03:09:50,580 --> 03:09:52,580
I'm worried about my grandson.

2049
03:09:52,580 --> 03:09:55,580
He went out to play but didn't come back when he should have.

2050
03:10:02,580 --> 03:10:04,580
I'm going to go someplace fun.

2051
03:10:04,580 --> 03:10:06,580
Standing around here is so boring.

2052
03:10:10,580 --> 03:10:12,580
There's things and stuff.

2053
03:10:18,580 --> 03:10:19,580
Hello, Maria.

2054
03:10:19,580 --> 03:10:21,580
It's so nice of you to drop by the shop.

2055
03:10:21,580 --> 03:10:23,580
What can I do for you?

2056
03:10:23,580 --> 03:10:25,580
Big shirt.

2057
03:10:25,580 --> 03:10:26,580
Big pants.

2058
03:10:26,580 --> 03:10:27,580
Yes.

2059
03:10:32,580 --> 03:10:33,580
Jump shoes.

2060
03:10:33,580 --> 03:10:35,580
Ended up in wake up pin.

2061
03:10:35,580 --> 03:10:36,580
True farm pin.

2062
03:10:36,580 --> 03:10:37,580
Fearless pin.

2063
03:10:44,580 --> 03:10:45,580
I don't know.

2064
03:10:46,580 --> 03:10:48,580
Mario, good to have a customer at last.

2065
03:10:48,580 --> 03:10:49,580
What do you need?

2066
03:10:50,580 --> 03:10:51,580
Mushroom.

2067
03:10:51,580 --> 03:10:52,580
Onion.

2068
03:10:58,580 --> 03:10:59,580
This.

2069
03:11:01,580 --> 03:11:02,580
This.

2070
03:11:09,580 --> 03:11:10,580
There you go.

2071
03:11:19,580 --> 03:11:20,580
Can I go in here already?

2072
03:11:20,580 --> 03:11:22,580
Yes, I already went in here.

2073
03:11:26,580 --> 03:11:28,580
It's a stay way that leads to my house,

2074
03:11:28,580 --> 03:11:30,580
but my son's been playing with the controls again.

2075
03:11:30,580 --> 03:11:32,580
Mario, only you could jump up there.

2076
03:11:32,580 --> 03:11:33,580
Please.

2077
03:11:33,580 --> 03:11:35,580
Let me get back to my house.

2078
03:11:35,580 --> 03:11:36,580
Okay.

2079
03:11:38,580 --> 03:11:40,580
How do I get back up?

2080
03:11:41,580 --> 03:11:43,580
Do I like jump on things and go weak?

2081
03:12:01,580 --> 03:12:02,580
Oh.

2082
03:12:10,580 --> 03:12:12,580
Is this the forest?

2083
03:12:18,580 --> 03:12:20,580
Now there is the forest.

2084
03:12:22,580 --> 03:12:24,580
Can we push these boxes?

2085
03:12:27,580 --> 03:12:28,580
No.

2086
03:12:30,580 --> 03:12:31,580
No.

2087
03:12:36,580 --> 03:12:37,580
Arn.

2088
03:12:40,580 --> 03:12:41,580
Well.

2089
03:12:51,580 --> 03:12:52,580
Well.

2090
03:12:57,580 --> 03:12:58,580
Horse maze.

2091
03:13:01,580 --> 03:13:02,580
Mushroom.

2092
03:13:06,580 --> 03:13:07,580
I can pick up mushrooms.

2093
03:13:08,580 --> 03:13:09,580
Yeah.

2094
03:13:09,580 --> 03:13:10,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2095
03:13:24,580 --> 03:13:25,580
Mushroom.

2096
03:13:26,580 --> 03:13:27,580
Not mushroom.

2097
03:13:27,580 --> 03:13:29,580
Not mushroom.

2098
03:13:57,580 --> 03:13:58,580
Mushroom.

2099
03:14:10,580 --> 03:14:11,580
Yes.

2100
03:14:11,580 --> 03:14:12,580
I got it.

2101
03:14:15,580 --> 03:14:16,580
Disgusting.

2102
03:14:28,580 --> 03:14:29,580
Mushroom.

2103
03:14:29,580 --> 03:14:31,580
Not real mushroom.

2104
03:14:33,580 --> 03:14:35,580
I want in a mushroom.

2105
03:14:57,580 --> 03:14:58,580
Mushroom.

2106
03:15:22,580 --> 03:15:25,580
I just wanted some mushrooms.

2107
03:15:28,580 --> 03:15:29,580
Mushroom.

2108
03:15:34,580 --> 03:15:35,580
Get over here.

2109
03:15:42,580 --> 03:15:43,580
That's right.

2110
03:15:43,580 --> 03:15:44,580
Run away, rats.

2111
03:15:44,580 --> 03:15:45,580
Run away.

2112
03:15:48,580 --> 03:15:50,580
Anything else over here?

2113
03:15:58,580 --> 03:15:59,580
Okay, fine.

2114
03:15:59,580 --> 03:16:00,580
I'll fight you.

2115
03:16:01,580 --> 03:16:03,580
Oh, it's got a stinger.

2116
03:16:08,580 --> 03:16:09,580
What's this egg?

2117
03:16:11,580 --> 03:16:12,580
Egg shell.

2118
03:16:14,580 --> 03:16:15,580
Thanks.

2119
03:16:15,580 --> 03:16:16,580
Defense up.

2120
03:16:27,580 --> 03:16:28,580
Okay.

2121
03:16:42,580 --> 03:16:43,580
Man.

2122
03:16:44,580 --> 03:16:45,580
Oh, wait, resistance.

2123
03:16:53,580 --> 03:16:54,580
I should heal up.

2124
03:16:54,580 --> 03:16:55,580
I should heal up.

2125
03:16:58,580 --> 03:16:59,580
Wow.

2126
03:17:12,580 --> 03:17:13,580
And.

2127
03:17:14,580 --> 03:17:18,580
What's, well, well, well, what's all this now?

2128
03:17:19,580 --> 03:17:21,580
Oh, did I just dodge it?

2129
03:17:28,580 --> 03:17:29,580
Hmm?

2130
03:17:33,580 --> 03:17:34,580
No mushroom.

2131
03:17:37,580 --> 03:17:38,580
Yep.

2132
03:17:38,580 --> 03:17:39,580
Yeah, fuck.

2133
03:17:57,580 --> 03:17:58,580
Oh, dang.

2134
03:18:03,580 --> 03:18:04,580
Oh, dang.

2135
03:18:28,580 --> 03:18:30,580
I turned into mushroom.

2136
03:18:49,580 --> 03:18:50,580
Yeah.

2137
03:18:57,580 --> 03:18:58,580
Yeah.

2138
03:19:12,580 --> 03:19:14,580
I turned into mushroom again.

2139
03:19:15,580 --> 03:19:16,580
Oh, shit.

2140
03:19:17,580 --> 03:19:20,580
No, not the double mushroom.

2141
03:19:22,580 --> 03:19:23,580
Oh, shit.

2142
03:19:23,580 --> 03:19:24,580
Okay.

2143
03:19:24,580 --> 03:19:28,580
I feel like I could definitely get rid of those.

2144
03:19:47,580 --> 03:19:48,580
Yeah.

2145
03:19:52,580 --> 03:19:53,580
Yeah.

2146
03:19:57,580 --> 03:19:58,580
Done.

2147
03:20:02,580 --> 03:20:03,580
Left yield's nothing.

2148
03:20:04,580 --> 03:20:05,580
Right, yields.

2149
03:20:08,580 --> 03:20:09,580
Anything?

2150
03:20:09,580 --> 03:20:10,580
Yeah.

2151
03:20:16,580 --> 03:20:17,580
Yeah.

2152
03:20:31,580 --> 03:20:32,580
Okay.

2153
03:20:36,580 --> 03:20:39,580
Okay, there's anything here, so.

2154
03:20:43,580 --> 03:20:44,580
Come on here.

2155
03:20:46,580 --> 03:20:47,580
Cool.

2156
03:21:02,580 --> 03:21:03,580
Ah!

2157
03:21:05,580 --> 03:21:06,580
Come on, bitch!

2158
03:21:10,580 --> 03:21:12,580
Hello!

2159
03:21:16,580 --> 03:21:17,580
Okay.

2160
03:21:38,580 --> 03:21:40,580
In the nose here.

2161
03:21:41,580 --> 03:21:43,580
Okay, kill this guy, too.

2162
03:21:46,580 --> 03:21:47,580
Okay.

2163
03:21:56,580 --> 03:21:57,580
Are they?

2164
03:21:57,580 --> 03:21:58,580
Ah!

2165
03:21:59,580 --> 03:22:00,580
Time's a special nu-

2166
03:22:00,580 --> 03:22:01,580
Oh, fuck.

2167
03:22:02,580 --> 03:22:03,580
No!

2168
03:22:03,580 --> 03:22:04,580
No, no, no, no, no!

2169
03:22:05,580 --> 03:22:06,580
Son of a bitch.

2170
03:22:16,580 --> 03:22:17,580
Okay.

2171
03:22:38,580 --> 03:22:39,580
Man!

2172
03:22:41,580 --> 03:22:42,580
Our first death!

2173
03:22:42,580 --> 03:22:44,580
I got stopped!

2174
03:22:46,580 --> 03:22:48,580
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, raise your level.

2175
03:22:48,580 --> 03:22:49,580
I know, I know.

2176
03:22:54,580 --> 03:22:56,580
Useless, useless.

2177
03:22:56,580 --> 03:22:58,580
Maybe not as useless.

2178
03:23:02,580 --> 03:23:04,580
No, I've been here already.

2179
03:23:17,580 --> 03:23:18,580
Okay.

2180
03:23:19,580 --> 03:23:20,580
Wake up, Madel.

2181
03:23:21,580 --> 03:23:22,580
Yeah, frickin'...

2182
03:23:23,580 --> 03:23:25,580
You're a frickin' glasshouse.

2183
03:23:47,580 --> 03:23:48,580
Okay.

2184
03:23:52,580 --> 03:23:53,580
Ah!

2185
03:23:53,580 --> 03:23:54,580
Yeah.

2186
03:24:15,580 --> 03:24:16,580
Ah!

2187
03:24:16,580 --> 03:24:17,580
Oh, yeah!

2188
03:24:42,580 --> 03:24:43,580
Yeah, mushroom.

2189
03:24:46,580 --> 03:24:47,580
Okay.

2190
03:24:52,580 --> 03:24:54,580
It's rocked right into that.

2191
03:25:12,580 --> 03:25:15,580
I get no coins, but I get experience.

2192
03:25:17,580 --> 03:25:18,580
Damn.

2193
03:25:19,580 --> 03:25:20,580
Okay.

2194
03:25:27,580 --> 03:25:28,580
Mushroom?

2195
03:25:28,580 --> 03:25:29,580
Real mushroom.

2196
03:25:34,580 --> 03:25:36,580
Hey, Gino!

2197
03:25:40,580 --> 03:25:43,580
Push mushroom into the storage box.

2198
03:25:43,580 --> 03:25:45,580
Can't carry any more of an item.

2199
03:25:45,580 --> 03:25:47,580
Any extras are sent to the storage box in Mario's pad.

2200
03:25:47,580 --> 03:25:49,580
You can take items out of storage there.

2201
03:25:50,580 --> 03:25:51,580
Nice!

2202
03:25:51,580 --> 03:25:54,580
Which means I can just, like, grab all these...

2203
03:25:55,580 --> 03:25:56,580
Mushrooms?

2204
03:25:56,580 --> 03:25:57,580
Neat.

2205
03:25:58,580 --> 03:26:00,580
Three mushrooms!

2206
03:26:02,580 --> 03:26:04,580
Wait, where did that bastard...

2207
03:26:05,580 --> 03:26:06,580
Where'd he go?

2208
03:26:06,580 --> 03:26:07,580
Oh.

2209
03:26:12,580 --> 03:26:13,580
Thank you.

2210
03:26:20,580 --> 03:26:22,580
Not the mushroomify!

2211
03:26:29,580 --> 03:26:30,580
Oh, come on.

2212
03:26:36,580 --> 03:26:38,580
Stop bullying me!

2213
03:26:40,580 --> 03:26:42,580
Which way did he go?

2214
03:26:43,580 --> 03:26:44,580
There he is.

2215
03:26:45,580 --> 03:26:46,580
Fuck.

2216
03:27:06,580 --> 03:27:07,580
Gino!

2217
03:27:16,580 --> 03:27:17,580
Stop running!

2218
03:27:32,580 --> 03:27:34,580
Here, I know this one first.

2219
03:27:36,580 --> 03:27:37,580
Okay.

2220
03:28:01,580 --> 03:28:02,580
Thanks!

2221
03:28:02,580 --> 03:28:04,580
That was a mushroom.

2222
03:28:06,580 --> 03:28:07,580
Okay.

2223
03:28:07,580 --> 03:28:08,580
Okay.

2224
03:28:08,580 --> 03:28:09,580
Okay.

2225
03:28:35,580 --> 03:28:37,580
Put mushroom in storage box.

2226
03:28:38,580 --> 03:28:40,580
Gino, come back to me!

2227
03:28:40,580 --> 03:28:41,580
No!

2228
03:28:44,580 --> 03:28:45,580
Please.

2229
03:28:47,580 --> 03:28:48,580
Please.

2230
03:28:49,580 --> 03:28:50,580
Ah!

2231
03:28:51,580 --> 03:28:52,580
Where are you?

2232
03:28:55,580 --> 03:28:57,580
Where are you going?

2233
03:29:01,580 --> 03:29:02,580
The safe.

2234
03:29:08,580 --> 03:29:10,580
Am I in Twubble?

2235
03:29:17,580 --> 03:29:18,580
Bow year?

2236
03:29:18,580 --> 03:29:19,580
997?

2237
03:29:19,580 --> 03:29:20,580
998?

2238
03:29:20,580 --> 03:29:21,580
999?

2239
03:29:21,580 --> 03:29:22,580
1000?

2240
03:29:22,580 --> 03:29:23,580
Nya ha ha!

2241
03:29:23,580 --> 03:29:24,580
1000 arrows!

2242
03:29:26,580 --> 03:29:27,580
For cover they run!

2243
03:29:27,580 --> 03:29:28,580
Nya!

2244
03:29:28,580 --> 03:29:29,580
Fun misses!

2245
03:29:29,580 --> 03:29:30,580
Yes!

2246
03:29:30,580 --> 03:29:31,580
Nya!

2247
03:29:31,580 --> 03:29:32,580
Nya!

2248
03:29:32,580 --> 03:29:33,580
Nya!

2249
03:29:33,580 --> 03:29:34,580
Nya!

2250
03:29:34,580 --> 03:29:35,580
Nya!

2251
03:29:35,580 --> 03:29:36,580
Nya!

2252
03:29:36,580 --> 03:29:37,580
Fun misses!

2253
03:29:37,580 --> 03:29:38,580
Yes!

2254
03:29:38,580 --> 03:29:39,580
Nya!

2255
03:29:39,580 --> 03:29:41,580
Another 1000 will I shoot?

2256
03:29:41,580 --> 03:29:42,580
Who's that guy?

2257
03:29:42,580 --> 03:29:45,580
He must be the one shooting arrows at Roastown.

2258
03:29:46,580 --> 03:29:47,580
Bow year.

2259
03:29:47,580 --> 03:29:48,580
Right.

2260
03:29:56,580 --> 03:29:58,580
He's kind of ugly.

2261
03:30:00,580 --> 03:30:04,580
After I am Nya, look at the expressions when I freeze.

2262
03:30:04,580 --> 03:30:06,580
When freeze they do.

2263
03:30:07,580 --> 03:30:09,580
They're standing like statues.

2264
03:30:10,580 --> 03:30:11,580
Nya!

2265
03:30:11,580 --> 03:30:13,580
Marpexes do I need.

2266
03:30:14,580 --> 03:30:16,580
Oh no, he's not stopping.

2267
03:30:16,580 --> 03:30:17,580
We gotta do something.

2268
03:30:18,580 --> 03:30:20,580
What do you think you are?

2269
03:30:20,580 --> 03:30:22,580
You can't just go in there with your fists flying.

2270
03:30:22,580 --> 03:30:23,580
Too many of them.

2271
03:30:23,580 --> 03:30:24,580
We'll be creamed.

2272
03:30:26,580 --> 03:30:27,580
Oh no, someone's coming.

2273
03:30:27,580 --> 03:30:29,580
Let's hide and see if they can learn anything.

2274
03:30:32,580 --> 03:30:33,580
A star!

2275
03:30:34,580 --> 03:30:35,580
Nya!

2276
03:30:40,580 --> 03:30:41,580
Look what I found, Boyer.

2277
03:30:42,580 --> 03:30:43,580
What?

2278
03:30:43,580 --> 03:30:45,580
The star of me you must not practice thing I am.

2279
03:30:45,580 --> 03:30:48,580
More arrows I must shoot, more statues I must make.

2280
03:30:48,580 --> 03:30:49,580
Nya!

2281
03:30:49,580 --> 03:30:50,580
Stop.

2282
03:30:53,580 --> 03:30:54,580
Hold it right there.

2283
03:30:54,580 --> 03:30:55,580
You don't know what you're doing.

2284
03:30:55,580 --> 03:30:57,580
Return that star to me.

2285
03:30:58,580 --> 03:30:59,580
Nya!

2286
03:30:59,580 --> 03:31:00,580
Nya!

2287
03:31:00,580 --> 03:31:01,580
Stranger you are.

2288
03:31:01,580 --> 03:31:02,580
Stranger looking at that.

2289
03:31:02,580 --> 03:31:03,580
Who's in charge?

2290
03:31:05,580 --> 03:31:07,580
Who might you be, Nya?

2291
03:31:08,580 --> 03:31:11,580
I serve a higher authority.

2292
03:31:13,580 --> 03:31:15,580
That star piece belongs to everyone.

2293
03:31:15,580 --> 03:31:16,580
You can't keep it.

2294
03:31:17,580 --> 03:31:18,580
Nya!

2295
03:31:18,580 --> 03:31:19,580
Nya!

2296
03:31:21,580 --> 03:31:23,580
Alas, the knight will teach you.

2297
03:31:28,580 --> 03:31:29,580
Hey, chill out.

2298
03:31:33,580 --> 03:31:35,580
Mario's dangerous out there.

2299
03:31:37,580 --> 03:31:39,580
We're gonna help, huh?

2300
03:31:39,580 --> 03:31:40,580
Blackout, weirdo.

2301
03:31:40,580 --> 03:31:41,580
Save guy in blue.

2302
03:31:42,580 --> 03:31:43,580
Me too.

2303
03:31:43,580 --> 03:31:45,580
I will do what I can.

2304
03:31:45,580 --> 03:31:47,580
But from over here.

2305
03:31:52,580 --> 03:31:54,580
I'm not afraid.

2306
03:31:55,580 --> 03:31:57,580
And I'm not gonna cry.

2307
03:31:58,580 --> 03:31:59,580
Nya!

2308
03:32:03,580 --> 03:32:05,580
Stop it, that's enough.

2309
03:32:06,580 --> 03:32:07,580
Nya!

2310
03:32:07,580 --> 03:32:08,580
Nya!

2311
03:32:08,580 --> 03:32:09,580
Strong you are.

2312
03:32:10,580 --> 03:32:11,580
But stronger I am.

2313
03:32:11,580 --> 03:32:13,580
I hurt you, I will.

2314
03:32:14,580 --> 03:32:15,580
So long.

2315
03:32:15,580 --> 03:32:16,580
Nya!

2316
03:32:16,580 --> 03:32:17,580
Part now we must.

2317
03:32:19,580 --> 03:32:20,580
Nya!

2318
03:32:22,580 --> 03:32:24,580
Thanks for your help.

2319
03:32:24,580 --> 03:32:25,580
Who are you?

2320
03:32:28,580 --> 03:32:31,580
Mario, you just ditched me back there.

2321
03:32:32,580 --> 03:32:34,580
I know you, you look familiar.

2322
03:32:35,580 --> 03:32:37,580
So, you're the Mario.

2323
03:32:37,580 --> 03:32:38,580
We know about you.

2324
03:32:40,580 --> 03:32:41,580
Nya!

2325
03:32:43,580 --> 03:32:44,580
Insulted I am!

2326
03:32:50,580 --> 03:32:51,580
Alright.

2327
03:32:51,580 --> 03:32:52,580
Hey, chill.

2328
03:32:53,580 --> 03:32:54,580
Alright, defense up.

2329
03:32:54,580 --> 03:32:55,580
Fine.

2330
03:33:01,580 --> 03:33:03,580
Now, how do we do this?

2331
03:33:03,580 --> 03:33:04,580
I'll just do an attack.

2332
03:33:08,580 --> 03:33:09,580
Special.

2333
03:33:09,580 --> 03:33:11,580
On the boat, please.

2334
03:33:12,580 --> 03:33:13,580
Alright.

2335
03:33:13,580 --> 03:33:14,580
I'll just do an attack.

2336
03:33:18,580 --> 03:33:19,580
Special.

2337
03:33:19,580 --> 03:33:20,580
On the boat, please.

2338
03:33:21,580 --> 03:33:22,580
Alright.

2339
03:33:25,580 --> 03:33:26,580
Nya!

2340
03:33:26,580 --> 03:33:28,580
Now three against one.

2341
03:33:32,580 --> 03:33:33,580
Nya!

2342
03:33:33,580 --> 03:33:34,580
Fair.

2343
03:33:34,580 --> 03:33:35,580
Fix it I will.

2344
03:33:35,580 --> 03:33:36,580
Nya!

2345
03:33:36,580 --> 03:33:37,580
Chewing narrow I shall.

2346
03:33:37,580 --> 03:33:38,580
And I...

2347
03:33:38,580 --> 03:33:41,580
When I target and hit stuff, I'm locked.

2348
03:33:42,580 --> 03:33:43,580
And locked are tortoises.

2349
03:33:43,580 --> 03:33:44,580
Nya!

2350
03:33:44,580 --> 03:33:45,580
Fair fight just between us.

2351
03:33:45,580 --> 03:33:46,580
Nya!

2352
03:33:46,580 --> 03:33:47,580
No more tortoises.

2353
03:33:48,580 --> 03:33:50,580
Obey my own rules I will.

2354
03:33:50,580 --> 03:33:51,580
So no complaints.

2355
03:33:51,580 --> 03:33:52,580
Nya!

2356
03:33:55,580 --> 03:33:56,580
Wait, what?

2357
03:34:00,580 --> 03:34:01,580
You know, beam.

2358
03:34:03,580 --> 03:34:05,580
Hold A for power.

2359
03:34:06,580 --> 03:34:07,580
And release that max.

2360
03:34:07,580 --> 03:34:08,580
Like this.

2361
03:34:09,580 --> 03:34:10,580
Oh, okay.

2362
03:34:20,580 --> 03:34:21,580
A's off!

2363
03:34:42,580 --> 03:34:45,580
Oh shit, I did it too soon.

2364
03:34:45,580 --> 03:34:46,580
That was not bad.

2365
03:34:50,580 --> 03:34:52,580
Come on, wake up, Gino.

2366
03:35:20,580 --> 03:35:21,580
Press A for sequence.

2367
03:35:21,580 --> 03:35:22,580
What the fuck is this?

2368
03:35:30,580 --> 03:35:31,580
Well, okay.

2369
03:35:35,580 --> 03:35:36,580
Lies off, okay.

2370
03:35:47,580 --> 03:35:48,580
That's fine.

2371
03:35:50,580 --> 03:35:51,580
Okay.

2372
03:36:13,580 --> 03:36:14,580
Ow.

2373
03:36:17,580 --> 03:36:18,580
Wake up Mario.

2374
03:36:20,580 --> 03:36:29,580
Metc Tobler

2375
03:36:29,580 --> 03:36:36,580
and

2376
03:36:36,580 --> 03:36:45,580
I

2377
03:36:45,580 --> 03:36:49,580
I

2378
03:36:49,580 --> 03:36:54,960
You ready?

2379
03:36:54,960 --> 03:36:56,960
Wake up, Kino!

2380
03:37:24,960 --> 03:37:38,960
Oh, do I hold it? Oh, sorry. I confused myself. Sorry.

2381
03:37:54,960 --> 03:38:01,960
I understood the assignment now! I understood the assignment now!

2382
03:38:25,960 --> 03:38:30,960
Can I use the mushroom on myself?

2383
03:38:37,960 --> 03:38:41,960
Can I use the mushroom on Malo?

2384
03:38:54,960 --> 03:38:59,960
Oh, sorry. I understood the assignment now!

2385
03:38:59,960 --> 03:39:04,960
Can I use the mushroom on Malo?

2386
03:39:04,960 --> 03:39:09,960
Oh, sorry. I understood the assignment now!

2387
03:39:25,960 --> 03:39:28,960
Off, off, off.

2388
03:39:28,960 --> 03:39:32,960
What are you going to do? You won't let us use a single move.

2389
03:39:32,960 --> 03:39:35,960
Listen, everyone. Proving that we're quite the team.

2390
03:39:35,960 --> 03:39:40,960
Join forces. All three of us at once. Take them down.

2391
03:39:40,960 --> 03:39:46,960
Say what? Yeah, for a dirty trick, you use the same stand-up hole. Yeah.

2392
03:39:46,960 --> 03:39:51,960
Oh, oh, oh, yeah. No allies do I have to join forces with.

2393
03:39:51,960 --> 03:39:57,960
You can now use triple moves. These powerful moves are available once the gauge is at 100.

2394
03:39:57,960 --> 03:40:01,960
Just this once will fill your gauge for free.

2395
03:40:01,960 --> 03:40:03,960
Triple.

2396
03:40:03,960 --> 03:40:06,960
Alright.

2397
03:40:06,960 --> 03:40:09,960
Oh!

2398
03:40:16,960 --> 03:40:19,960
How cute!

2399
03:40:22,960 --> 03:40:28,960
Power of friendship! You win!

2400
03:40:28,960 --> 03:40:32,960
Kind of flower box.

2401
03:40:32,960 --> 03:40:37,960
Thanks for your help. You really got me out of a jam.

2402
03:40:37,960 --> 03:40:42,960
Are you staring at me? You know I'm more than just a doll, don't you?

2403
03:40:42,960 --> 03:40:47,960
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh yeah, oh yeah.

2404
03:40:47,960 --> 03:40:54,960
Have you guessed the truth? I'm a visitor from above. This is a form I'm borrowing briefly.

2405
03:40:54,960 --> 03:40:58,960
Whoa! You mean, like, from the sky or something?

2406
03:40:58,960 --> 03:41:03,960
Higher than that, I'm afraid. Do you two know anything about the Star Road?

2407
03:41:03,960 --> 03:41:05,960
No.

2408
03:41:05,960 --> 03:41:08,960
No? Completely in the dark, eh?

2409
03:41:08,960 --> 03:41:13,960
Oh, it's a big mess up there right now, and it concerns you too. Let me explain.

2410
03:41:13,960 --> 03:41:16,960
You've heard of wishing upon a shooting star?

2411
03:41:16,960 --> 03:41:21,960
At the Star Road, your wish is transformed into a star.

2412
03:41:21,960 --> 03:41:29,960
When it's granted, then it then turns into a shooting star and falls down to earth.

2413
03:41:29,960 --> 03:41:35,960
So you see, the Star Road plays an integral role in granting wishes.

2414
03:41:35,960 --> 03:41:40,960
But, ever since a sword destroyed the Star Road, everything's come to a halt.

2415
03:41:40,960 --> 03:41:51,960
No star has been made since. The way things stand, yours is a world where wishes can't come true anymore.

2416
03:41:51,960 --> 03:41:56,960
Are you saying this star is part of your Star Way?

2417
03:41:56,960 --> 03:42:02,960
That's Star Road, my fluffy little friend. Yes, this star is a broken piece of the Star Road.

2418
03:42:02,960 --> 03:42:05,960
I'm here to find them all and repair the Star Road.

2419
03:42:05,960 --> 03:42:09,960
For broken star pieces, there are seven all together.

2420
03:42:09,960 --> 03:42:13,960
For peace to return, let's get rid of Smithy.

2421
03:42:13,960 --> 03:42:18,960
Find the star pieces and repair the Star Road.

2422
03:42:18,960 --> 03:42:22,960
I'm...what?

2423
03:42:22,960 --> 03:42:26,960
I don't know. I just decided to pick a sound.

2424
03:42:26,960 --> 03:42:28,960
That's hard to pronounce, so...

2425
03:42:28,960 --> 03:42:31,960
Call me Gino after the doll.

2426
03:42:31,960 --> 03:42:35,960
I chose him because he looked the strongest out of the dolls.

2427
03:42:35,960 --> 03:42:38,960
Now grab the star, Mario.

2428
03:42:38,960 --> 03:42:42,960
Did he just call Mario looking weak?

2429
03:43:01,960 --> 03:43:07,960
Come on, let's get the show on the road.

2430
03:43:07,960 --> 03:43:14,960
Gino, who is searching for the pieces of the Star Road, joins Mario and Mallow.

2431
03:43:14,960 --> 03:43:19,960
Things are definitely looking up.

2432
03:43:19,960 --> 03:43:24,960
Oh, I heard everything who would have known that star was so important.

2433
03:43:24,960 --> 03:43:29,960
Gotta inform Smithy.

2434
03:43:29,960 --> 03:43:33,960
The secret to the shooting stars has been unraveled.

2435
03:43:33,960 --> 03:43:39,960
Find the star pieces and bring peace back to Mario's world.

2436
03:43:40,960 --> 03:43:44,960
The secret to the shooting stars has been unraveled.

2437
03:43:44,960 --> 03:43:49,960
Find the star pieces and bring peace back to Mario's world.

2438
03:43:51,960 --> 03:43:55,960
Come here, towel tail!

2439
03:44:09,960 --> 03:44:14,960
Ooh! Everything's back to normal now.

2440
03:44:14,960 --> 03:44:19,960
Things are finally back to normal. Thank you, Mario.

2441
03:44:19,960 --> 03:44:24,960
I can finally move. Guess I owe a doll to Mario. What an amazing guy.

2442
03:44:32,960 --> 03:44:34,960
Gino, you came back!

2443
03:44:34,960 --> 03:44:37,960
Mommy!

2444
03:44:37,960 --> 03:44:40,960
Mom, this is the Gino I was talking about.

2445
03:44:40,960 --> 03:44:46,960
My, my. What a fabulous costume. It'd be kind of hard for the person wearing it, though.

2446
03:44:46,960 --> 03:44:50,960
I'll forget it, Mom. Alright, Gino, let's play.

2447
03:44:50,960 --> 03:44:56,960
How I wish I could. Mario and I must leave to find the missing star pieces.

2448
03:44:56,960 --> 03:45:00,960
Star pieces? You mean shooting stars? What for?

2449
03:45:00,960 --> 03:45:03,960
Well, how can I explain this?

2450
03:45:03,960 --> 03:45:06,960
Oh, guys, it's like this.

2451
03:45:14,960 --> 03:45:18,960
It's how it used to be, but now it's like this.

2452
03:45:23,960 --> 03:45:26,960
This. Do you get it?

2453
03:45:26,960 --> 03:45:31,960
Uh-huh. Uh, uh, nope, you lost me.

2454
03:45:32,960 --> 03:45:39,960
Let's just say that if things stay the way they are, your wishes will never come true.

2455
03:45:39,960 --> 03:45:44,960
What? So you mean, even if I grow up, I won't be strong and cool like you?

2456
03:45:44,960 --> 03:45:48,960
No one's wishes will come true until the star pieces are found.

2457
03:45:48,960 --> 03:45:51,960
A star road repaired.

2458
03:45:51,960 --> 03:45:57,960
That's why I've chosen to join these two in order to find the missing star pieces.

2459
03:45:57,960 --> 03:46:03,960
Oh, that's it. Oh, Mario. Oh, Mario needs all the help he can get.

2460
03:46:03,960 --> 03:46:06,960
Is he about to punch this kid?

2461
03:46:06,960 --> 03:46:09,960
Is he about to punch this kid?

2462
03:46:14,960 --> 03:46:17,960
Is he about to kill this child?

2463
03:46:18,960 --> 03:46:24,960
You know what? I did see something sparkly fall somewhere near Movil.

2464
03:46:24,960 --> 03:46:28,960
You think? It's one of those things you're looking for, Tino?

2465
03:46:30,960 --> 03:46:35,960
Seems highly probable. We'll make Movil our next stop. Thank you for telling us about it.

2466
03:46:35,960 --> 03:46:37,960
I'll be waiting for you.

2467
03:46:37,960 --> 03:46:41,960
You still fix the star road and make sure all my dreams come true.

2468
03:46:41,960 --> 03:46:43,960
That's a promise.

2469
03:46:43,960 --> 03:46:46,960
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

2470
03:46:48,960 --> 03:46:52,960
This is yours, Tino. Let's take it along with you.

2471
03:46:52,960 --> 03:46:55,960
Got a finger shot.

2472
03:46:55,960 --> 03:47:00,960
Thanks for being good support, Gazz. See you when I attack.

2473
03:47:03,960 --> 03:47:06,960
Look at him, Tino. You're the main man.

2474
03:47:06,960 --> 03:47:09,960
You're the main man.

2475
03:47:09,960 --> 03:47:12,960
Look at him, Tino. You're the main man.

2476
03:47:13,960 --> 03:47:15,960
Mario, how are you feeling?

2477
03:47:15,960 --> 03:47:18,960
You need coffee. Keep away.

2478
03:47:20,960 --> 03:47:23,960
Yes, you look awesome. Why don't you rest some more?

2479
03:47:27,960 --> 03:47:29,960
Right here.

2480
03:47:35,960 --> 03:47:37,960
Inequip the item.

2481
03:47:39,960 --> 03:47:41,960
Here.

2482
03:47:53,960 --> 03:47:57,960
We should buy Tino stuff. Yeah, we should.

2483
03:48:03,960 --> 03:48:06,960
Aw, now the kids are doing it.

2484
03:48:07,960 --> 03:48:11,960
That was close, but I made it on time.

2485
03:48:11,960 --> 03:48:16,960
I'm so proud of my grants. I'm so proud of my grants. Let's just look at them.

2486
03:48:16,960 --> 03:48:20,960
Now I can finally go to the forest to chop wood.

2487
03:48:22,960 --> 03:48:27,960
I think they're finally back to normal. Thank you, Mario.

2488
03:48:27,960 --> 03:48:32,960
Thought I heard a big boom from over the mountains. Starting to hear things.

2489
03:48:32,960 --> 03:48:36,960
Hello, Mario. It's nice of you to drop by the shop. What can I do for you?

2490
03:48:38,960 --> 03:48:40,960
No. No.

2491
03:48:45,960 --> 03:48:48,960
No. Are these too expensive?

2492
03:49:02,960 --> 03:49:07,960
I can put on the jumpshoes, and you can have the true warm fin. Yeah.

2493
03:49:07,960 --> 03:49:12,960
Yeah, plenty of money, though. Not too much money.

2494
03:49:16,960 --> 03:49:18,960
There you go. I got it.

2495
03:49:22,960 --> 03:49:24,960
I got it.

2496
03:49:25,960 --> 03:49:28,960
There you go. I got it.

2497
03:49:29,960 --> 03:49:31,960
Hmm.

2498
03:49:49,960 --> 03:49:52,960
And look, the secret!

2499
03:49:52,960 --> 03:49:57,960
Send me another house to have, like, I can go onto other houses?

2500
03:49:59,960 --> 03:50:01,960
No, I can't.

2501
03:50:01,960 --> 03:50:04,960
I don't like it up here. I want to go up here.

2502
03:50:05,960 --> 03:50:08,960
Let me up. Let me up.

2503
03:50:09,960 --> 03:50:13,960
I don't want to go to your house. I want to go to your house, mister.

2504
03:50:13,960 --> 03:50:16,960
I want to go to your house, mister.

2505
03:50:20,960 --> 03:50:25,960
Alright, someone asked earlier about what is your favorite essay about Hargapter Sakura?

2506
03:50:26,960 --> 03:50:31,960
Um, the ones that have a lot of heart in it.

2507
03:50:35,960 --> 03:50:39,960
Jump on the Toad's head. Can I do that? I guess I can, right?

2508
03:50:44,960 --> 03:50:46,960
Wait, no.

2509
03:50:48,960 --> 03:50:50,960
Can I?

2510
03:50:50,960 --> 03:50:52,960
Stay still.

2511
03:50:54,960 --> 03:50:57,960
Oh, my God.

2512
03:50:58,960 --> 03:51:01,960
Oh, my God. Oh, yeah! We got it!

2513
03:51:01,960 --> 03:51:03,960
Huh.

2514
03:51:11,960 --> 03:51:15,960
What's Daddy taking so long? Do you think he's still looking for the treasure?

2515
03:51:18,960 --> 03:51:20,960
Oh, hey.

2516
03:51:20,960 --> 03:51:32,960
Thanks, Million Mario. Say, for my treasures. Okay.

2517
03:51:42,960 --> 03:51:44,960
Ow!

2518
03:51:44,960 --> 03:51:46,960
I-I will...

2519
03:51:46,960 --> 03:51:48,960
I-I will...

2520
03:51:53,960 --> 03:51:59,960
Um, about that. I mean, I've taken them.

2521
03:52:02,960 --> 03:52:04,960
Um...

2522
03:52:05,960 --> 03:52:07,960
I wouldn't say so.

2523
03:52:07,960 --> 03:52:09,960
You're kidding.

2524
03:52:10,960 --> 03:52:16,960
What? They're gone, Mario! You're the only one who can reach them!

2525
03:52:16,960 --> 03:52:18,960
Sorry, I got carried away.

2526
03:52:18,960 --> 03:52:22,960
Well, since we didn't get hit by any arrows, I'll tell you a secret.

2527
03:52:22,960 --> 03:52:25,960
Enter the forest when you hit an area with a corp...

2528
03:52:25,960 --> 03:52:27,960
Corpap.

2529
03:52:27,960 --> 03:52:29,960
Wait, hold on.

2530
03:52:33,960 --> 03:52:35,960
Left.

2531
03:52:36,960 --> 03:52:38,960
Left.

2532
03:52:38,960 --> 03:52:40,960
Right.

2533
03:52:42,960 --> 03:52:44,960
Right.

2534
03:52:50,960 --> 03:52:53,960
You'll surely find something nice.

2535
03:52:53,960 --> 03:52:56,960
I'm sorry, I got carried away!

2536
03:52:56,960 --> 03:52:59,960
I'm sorry, that was my fault!

2537
03:52:59,960 --> 03:53:01,960
Uh-huh.

2538
03:53:05,960 --> 03:53:08,960
Well, let's try it, right?

2539
03:53:08,960 --> 03:53:11,960
In the forest, right?

2540
03:53:11,960 --> 03:53:13,960
Corpaps.

2541
03:53:15,960 --> 03:53:17,960
You son of a bitch.

2542
03:53:17,960 --> 03:53:19,960
Okay.

2543
03:53:28,960 --> 03:53:31,960
And we're out of way!

2544
03:53:47,960 --> 03:53:50,960
Corpap, huh?

2545
03:53:58,960 --> 03:54:00,960
That's not four.

2546
03:54:11,960 --> 03:54:13,960
This four?

2547
03:54:18,960 --> 03:54:21,960
Can I jump on you?

2548
03:54:31,960 --> 03:54:33,960
Nevermind, it's fine.

2549
03:54:35,960 --> 03:54:37,960
Nevermind, it's fine.

2550
03:54:37,960 --> 03:54:39,960
Is this four?

2551
03:54:44,960 --> 03:54:47,960
Ah, you slurped me!

2552
03:55:08,960 --> 03:55:12,960
Oh, it's above ground, okay.

2553
03:55:12,960 --> 03:55:14,960
Ooh, level up!

2554
03:55:16,960 --> 03:55:18,960
That's so cool.

2555
03:55:24,960 --> 03:55:26,960
Hey, Mercy, what...

2556
03:55:26,960 --> 03:55:30,960
What mic do I use for gaming streams?

2557
03:55:30,960 --> 03:55:32,960
80-2020.

2558
03:55:36,960 --> 03:55:39,960
Four, right? Is this four?

2559
03:55:40,960 --> 03:55:42,960
Left.

2560
03:55:46,960 --> 03:55:48,960
Left.

2561
03:55:51,960 --> 03:55:53,960
Straight.

2562
03:55:54,960 --> 03:55:56,960
Straight?

2563
03:56:01,960 --> 03:56:03,960
Right?

2564
03:56:03,960 --> 03:56:05,960
Is this correct?

2565
03:56:24,960 --> 03:56:27,960
That's left, is that left?

2566
03:56:30,960 --> 03:56:32,960
Which way is right?

2567
03:56:32,960 --> 03:56:34,960
This right?

2568
03:56:41,960 --> 03:56:43,960
Senpai.

2569
03:56:46,960 --> 03:56:49,960
Senpai!

2570
03:56:54,960 --> 03:56:56,960
Wait, the wrong way.

2571
03:56:56,960 --> 03:56:58,960
Go straight here.

2572
03:57:07,960 --> 03:57:09,960
I think this was...

2573
03:57:09,960 --> 03:57:11,960
I think this was it.

2574
03:57:11,960 --> 03:57:13,960
Yeah, yeah, okay.

2575
03:57:13,960 --> 03:57:15,960
Left.

2576
03:57:18,960 --> 03:57:20,960
Two lefts, right?

2577
03:57:21,960 --> 03:57:23,960
This is one left.

2578
03:57:29,960 --> 03:57:32,960
Is this left over here?

2579
03:57:36,960 --> 03:57:38,960
No, no, no.

2580
03:57:40,960 --> 03:57:42,960
Left over here?

2581
03:57:44,960 --> 03:57:46,960
This is left.

2582
03:57:47,960 --> 03:57:49,960
Wait.

2583
03:57:52,960 --> 03:57:55,960
Wait, I confused myself.

2584
03:58:00,960 --> 03:58:02,960
Okay, somewhere you enter.

2585
03:58:08,960 --> 03:58:10,960
Okay, left.

2586
03:58:13,960 --> 03:58:15,960
Left.

2587
03:58:17,960 --> 03:58:19,960
Straight.

2588
03:58:22,960 --> 03:58:24,960
That's straight, right?

2589
03:58:27,960 --> 03:58:29,960
Right.

2590
03:58:29,960 --> 03:58:31,960
This is right, right?

2591
03:58:32,960 --> 03:58:34,960
Wait.

2592
03:58:34,960 --> 03:58:37,960
That's left. Wait, what?

2593
03:58:39,960 --> 03:58:41,960
This one?

2594
03:58:46,960 --> 03:58:48,960
Left.

2595
03:58:53,960 --> 03:58:55,960
Let this start over.

2596
03:58:55,960 --> 03:58:57,960
Left.

2597
03:59:14,960 --> 03:59:16,960
Reactions are hard.

2598
03:59:19,960 --> 03:59:21,960
Okay, ready?

2599
03:59:22,960 --> 03:59:24,960
Left.

2600
03:59:26,960 --> 03:59:28,960
Left.

2601
03:59:29,960 --> 03:59:31,960
Straight.

2602
03:59:35,960 --> 03:59:37,960
Right.

2603
03:59:55,960 --> 03:59:57,960
Right.

2604
04:00:06,960 --> 04:00:08,960
This one, right?

2605
04:00:10,960 --> 04:00:12,960
It's here!

2606
04:00:25,960 --> 04:00:27,960
Yeah!

2607
04:00:27,960 --> 04:00:29,960
We did it!

2608
04:00:30,960 --> 04:00:32,960
Yeah!

2609
04:00:33,960 --> 04:00:35,960
Yatta!

2610
04:00:35,960 --> 04:00:38,960
I may have been directly challenged.

2611
04:00:42,960 --> 04:00:45,960
I'm just gonna take the map now.

2612
04:00:46,960 --> 04:00:49,960
I'm just gonna take the map now and be like,

2613
04:00:49,960 --> 04:00:51,960
hey, I found it!

2614
04:00:54,960 --> 04:00:56,960
I'm sorry.

2615
04:00:57,960 --> 04:01:00,960
I'm on the treasure, way to go, keep up the good work.

2616
04:01:00,960 --> 04:01:02,960
I'm sorry I stole all of them.

2617
04:01:02,960 --> 04:01:04,960
Yeah, I jumped in it, I do it out of time,

2618
04:01:04,960 --> 04:01:06,960
it really winds my dad up.

2619
04:01:06,960 --> 04:01:08,960
This fucking brat.

2620
04:01:08,960 --> 04:01:11,960
All kids in this game, right?

2621
04:01:29,960 --> 04:01:31,960
I'm sorry.

2622
04:01:31,960 --> 04:01:33,960
I'm sorry.

2623
04:01:33,960 --> 04:01:40,960
Pipe vault.

2624
04:01:40,960 --> 04:01:44,960
What's the smallville?

2625
04:01:44,960 --> 04:01:51,960
Okay, let's go to this pipe vault.

2626
04:01:51,960 --> 04:01:55,960
Let's just exit out again.

2627
04:01:55,960 --> 04:01:59,960
Just exit out again.

2628
04:01:59,960 --> 04:02:07,960
Pipe vault.

2629
04:02:07,960 --> 04:02:12,960
Oh no.

2630
04:02:12,960 --> 04:02:17,960
Okay, let's just exit out again.

2631
04:02:17,960 --> 04:02:22,960
Okay, let's just exit out again.

2632
04:02:22,960 --> 04:02:27,960
Okay, let's just exit out again.

2633
04:02:27,960 --> 04:02:32,960
Thanks.

2634
04:02:32,960 --> 04:02:39,960
Whoa!

2635
04:02:40,960 --> 04:02:49,960
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2636
04:03:02,960 --> 04:03:08,960
Blood. Bloodless.

2637
04:03:08,960 --> 04:03:09,800
Magic!

2638
04:03:18,160 --> 04:03:19,320
There's two pipes.

2639
04:03:22,120 --> 04:03:23,680
One's a lie!

2640
04:03:23,680 --> 04:03:24,840
Understood, one's a lie.

2641
04:03:25,800 --> 04:03:26,640
Right?

2642
04:03:35,300 --> 04:03:36,140
Wait.

2643
04:03:39,960 --> 04:03:40,860
Hm?

2644
04:03:44,980 --> 04:03:47,060
Otherwise, it be tiny.

2645
04:03:50,500 --> 04:03:51,660
Kasunpi!

2646
04:04:08,960 --> 04:04:13,960
How do I change the party leader?

2647
04:04:13,960 --> 04:04:20,960
Like this?

2648
04:04:20,960 --> 04:04:30,960
Well, I can't do anything about it.

2649
04:04:30,960 --> 04:04:36,960
Oh well.

2650
04:04:36,960 --> 04:04:39,960
Oh well.

2651
04:04:39,960 --> 04:04:50,960
Probably something to do later, whatever.

2652
04:04:50,960 --> 04:04:52,960
Oh hi!

2653
04:04:52,960 --> 04:04:53,960
Hey mate, stick right up.

2654
04:04:53,960 --> 04:04:55,960
I'm going to do some Goomba Thumpin'.

2655
04:04:55,960 --> 04:04:57,960
How about a minute?

2656
04:04:57,960 --> 04:04:59,960
I'll save it another day.

2657
04:04:59,960 --> 04:05:08,960
Damn!

2658
04:05:08,960 --> 04:05:14,960
Why is he so mad at me? Fine.

2659
04:05:14,960 --> 04:05:16,960
Know the rules?

2660
04:05:16,960 --> 04:05:18,960
Nope.

2661
04:05:18,960 --> 04:05:20,960
Thump a Goomba, get one point.

2662
04:05:20,960 --> 04:05:22,960
Stump a Spikey, lose a point.

2663
04:05:22,960 --> 04:05:25,960
Thump a Gold, Goomba, get three points.

2664
04:05:25,960 --> 04:05:27,960
Twenty points and more, get a prize.

2665
04:05:27,960 --> 04:05:29,960
Want to recap?

2666
04:05:29,960 --> 04:05:31,960
No thanks.

2667
04:05:31,960 --> 04:05:32,960
How do I do this?

2668
04:05:32,960 --> 04:05:34,960
Easier if you stand in the middle.

2669
04:05:34,960 --> 04:05:35,960
Like this?

2670
04:05:35,960 --> 04:05:41,960
Get as many as you can, alright?

2671
04:05:41,960 --> 04:05:44,960
Wait, like this?

2672
04:05:44,960 --> 04:05:47,960
Oh!

2673
04:05:47,960 --> 04:05:54,960
This is a little hard!

2674
04:05:54,960 --> 04:06:19,960
Hey.

2675
04:06:19,960 --> 04:06:44,960
Wait, can I go through all of them?

2676
04:06:44,960 --> 04:06:48,960
No, that was a lie.

2677
04:06:48,960 --> 04:06:59,960
That one's a lie.

2678
04:06:59,960 --> 04:07:02,960
That one's a lie.

2679
04:07:02,960 --> 04:07:04,960
That's real.

2680
04:07:04,960 --> 04:07:17,960
Real.

2681
04:07:17,960 --> 04:07:32,960
Kind of a bitch.

2682
04:07:32,960 --> 04:07:38,960
I thought I had the timing right.

2683
04:07:38,960 --> 04:08:04,960
When I said I thought I had the timing right, I thought I had the timing right.

2684
04:08:04,960 --> 04:08:11,960
What are these things?

2685
04:08:11,960 --> 04:08:27,960
Why are you just taking my money?

2686
04:08:27,960 --> 04:08:31,960
Fuck you.

2687
04:08:31,960 --> 04:08:41,960
My money.

2688
04:08:41,960 --> 04:08:46,960
Son of a bitch.

2689
04:08:46,960 --> 04:08:59,960
I'm about to start hurrying.

2690
04:08:59,960 --> 04:09:09,960
I was wondering what was happening and then I was...

2691
04:09:09,960 --> 04:09:38,960
Fuck this game, my money.

2692
04:09:38,960 --> 04:09:47,960
Don't start.

2693
04:09:47,960 --> 04:09:54,960
I don't know what the fuck is this place.

2694
04:09:54,960 --> 04:09:55,960
Yoshi!

2695
04:09:55,960 --> 04:09:56,960
Yoshi!

2696
04:09:56,960 --> 04:10:09,960
There's nothing inside.

2697
04:10:09,960 --> 04:10:15,960
There's a letter and I care to read it?

2698
04:10:15,960 --> 04:10:16,960
Sure.

2699
04:10:16,960 --> 04:10:19,960
Honeymoon reservation for two.

2700
04:10:19,960 --> 04:10:33,960
Mushroom travel agency.

2701
04:10:33,960 --> 04:10:38,960
Mario, glad you made it to Yostar by a home of the Mushroom Derby.

2702
04:10:38,960 --> 04:10:41,960
Say, now that you're here, we can use your help.

2703
04:10:41,960 --> 04:10:43,960
Please talk to a few of my pals herein.

2704
04:10:43,960 --> 04:10:44,960
Oh, you can't understand them well.

2705
04:10:44,960 --> 04:10:48,960
I'll hop before and I'll be your interpreter.

2706
04:10:48,960 --> 04:10:49,960
Yoshi!

2707
04:10:49,960 --> 04:10:52,960
Yoshi!

2708
04:10:52,960 --> 04:10:53,960
What are you all looking at?

2709
04:10:53,960 --> 04:10:58,960
You want to challenge me, you have to bring cookies.

2710
04:10:58,960 --> 04:11:03,960
It would be so much better if we could all race together.

2711
04:11:03,960 --> 04:11:07,960
Yoshi, you think you can meet the old bushy today?

2712
04:11:07,960 --> 04:11:09,960
Not now today.

2713
04:11:09,960 --> 04:11:11,960
That may mean other days, so you heard, right?

2714
04:11:11,960 --> 04:11:15,960
Just waiting for the day we can all race together.

2715
04:11:15,960 --> 04:11:22,960
Yoshi only races one on one, so everyone can't join us too bad.

2716
04:11:22,960 --> 04:11:27,960
Oh, she peers the fastest runner, but he falls on himself.

2717
04:11:27,960 --> 04:11:29,960
Why do you crack races in my life?

2718
04:11:29,960 --> 04:11:38,960
I could run a day, and I know when I saw not too long ago a star falling somewhere in your mobile.

2719
04:11:38,960 --> 04:11:45,960
I have to bring cookies.

2720
04:11:45,960 --> 04:11:50,960
Hey, there's a letter in here, but I can't read it.

2721
04:11:50,960 --> 04:12:00,960
Did I talk to everyone?

2722
04:12:00,960 --> 04:12:03,960
Fuck it, let's do it.

2723
04:12:03,960 --> 04:12:05,960
Yeah, let's do it.

2724
04:12:05,960 --> 04:12:06,960
Here, take my cookies.

2725
04:12:06,960 --> 04:12:08,960
Good luck, I'm rooting for you.

2726
04:12:08,960 --> 04:12:11,960
Thanks, I've got major support on my side, so I can probably win today.

2727
04:12:11,960 --> 04:12:16,960
Oh, she got some cookies.

2728
04:12:16,960 --> 04:12:20,960
You're going to beat Boshi, the yellow one.

2729
04:12:20,960 --> 04:12:23,960
This is Boshi.

2730
04:12:23,960 --> 04:12:25,960
Oh wait, honeymoon.

2731
04:12:25,960 --> 04:12:27,960
I love honey.

2732
04:12:27,960 --> 04:12:31,960
I want to go on a honeymoon with some pie.

2733
04:12:31,960 --> 04:12:33,960
Ah, so you brought yourself cookies, alright.

2734
04:12:33,960 --> 04:12:35,960
Consider yourself lucky today.

2735
04:12:35,960 --> 04:12:37,960
One on one.

2736
04:12:37,960 --> 04:12:40,960
So how do I do this?

2737
04:12:40,960 --> 04:12:42,960
Oh, again.

2738
04:12:42,960 --> 04:12:43,960
Oh, once again.

2739
04:12:43,960 --> 04:12:45,960
Get ready for the mushroom derbies coming up.

2740
04:12:45,960 --> 04:12:47,960
One instructions, yeah.

2741
04:12:47,960 --> 04:12:50,960
Guess A and B alternately with the rhythm.

2742
04:12:50,960 --> 04:12:52,960
Titer the rhythm, the faster you go.

2743
04:12:52,960 --> 04:12:54,960
Spy during the rate to eat a cookie.

2744
04:12:54,960 --> 04:12:57,960
Energy will help you go faster.

2745
04:12:57,960 --> 04:13:02,960
Okay, one instruction again.

2746
04:13:02,960 --> 04:13:05,960
I'll try, keep on aiming between A and B in time to the beat.

2747
04:13:05,960 --> 04:13:08,960
Let's practice.

2748
04:13:08,960 --> 04:13:18,960
One, two, one, two, one, two, three.

2749
04:13:18,960 --> 04:13:22,960
Uh.

2750
04:13:22,960 --> 04:13:24,960
I'm not getting it right at all.

2751
04:13:24,960 --> 04:13:28,960
Are you sure you want to do this?

2752
04:13:28,960 --> 04:13:31,960
I feel cold out.

2753
04:13:31,960 --> 04:13:35,960
I feel cold out!

2754
04:13:35,960 --> 04:13:41,960
Ahhhh!

2755
04:13:41,960 --> 04:13:43,960
Ahhhh!

2756
04:13:43,960 --> 04:13:52,960
I feel cold out!

2757
04:13:52,960 --> 04:14:21,960
What am I doing wrong?

2758
04:14:21,960 --> 04:14:49,960
Am I alternating the wrong way?

2759
04:14:49,960 --> 04:15:15,960
Okay, I'll try it again.

2760
04:15:15,960 --> 04:15:44,960
Ahhhh, we're doomed!

2761
04:15:44,960 --> 04:16:04,960
Okay, I'll try it again.

2762
04:16:04,960 --> 04:16:32,960
I could say screw and just race, I guess.

2763
04:16:32,960 --> 04:16:54,960
Fuck it.

2764
04:16:54,960 --> 04:16:57,960
Wait!

2765
04:16:57,960 --> 04:17:04,960
Wait, what's going on?

2766
04:17:04,960 --> 04:17:11,960
Wait.

2767
04:17:11,960 --> 04:17:25,960
Am I pressing the wrong buttons?

2768
04:17:25,960 --> 04:17:52,960
Oh, I'm pressing A and B, right?

2769
04:17:53,960 --> 04:18:21,960
Okay, now everyone has learned that I have no sense of rhythm.

2770
04:18:21,960 --> 04:18:36,960
Okay, now everyone has learned that I have no sense of rhythm.

2771
04:18:36,960 --> 04:19:02,960
Ahhhh!

2772
04:19:02,960 --> 04:19:30,960
Ahhhh!

2773
04:19:30,960 --> 04:19:33,960
I've been using a visual guide!

2774
04:19:33,960 --> 04:19:35,460
Okay.

2775
04:19:39,560 --> 04:19:43,860
Okay, one two,

2776
04:19:43,860 --> 04:19:46,900
one two, one two, three.

2777
04:19:46,900 --> 04:19:49,640
One, two, one two, one two, one two,

2778
04:19:49,640 --> 04:19:53,960
one two, one two, one two, one two, one two,

2779
04:19:54,260 --> 04:19:56,760
one-

2780
04:19:56,760 --> 04:19:57,960
Son of a bitch!

2781
04:20:03,960 --> 04:20:10,960
It's too fast!

2782
04:20:33,960 --> 04:20:40,960
Oh my gosh, I have no sense of rhythm!

2783
04:21:03,960 --> 04:21:10,960
I hate this! I hate this!

2784
04:21:14,960 --> 04:21:20,960
I hate this so much!

2785
04:21:33,960 --> 04:21:38,960
I hate this!

2786
04:21:38,960 --> 04:21:43,960
I hate this!

2787
04:21:43,960 --> 04:21:48,960
I hate this so much!

2788
04:21:48,960 --> 04:21:53,960
I hate this!

2789
04:21:53,960 --> 04:21:58,960
I hate this!

2790
04:21:58,960 --> 04:22:03,960
I hate this!

2791
04:22:03,960 --> 04:22:08,960
I'm gonna do it again!

2792
04:22:08,960 --> 04:22:13,960
I hate this!

2793
04:22:13,960 --> 04:22:18,960
I'm very stubborn!

2794
04:22:18,960 --> 04:22:23,960
I hate this!

2795
04:22:24,960 --> 04:22:26,960
I'm very stubborn!

2796
04:22:34,960 --> 04:22:35,960
Fuck you!

2797
04:22:53,960 --> 04:23:06,960
Oh! I did it!

2798
04:23:09,960 --> 04:23:12,960
Wow, unbelievable! You just before she!

2799
04:23:13,960 --> 04:23:15,960
Starting today, Yoshi's a new boss around here.

2800
04:23:16,960 --> 04:23:18,960
Since when have you been able to sprint like that?

2801
04:23:18,960 --> 04:23:21,960
Oh, I had my day in the sun. Let me give you a tip.

2802
04:23:21,960 --> 04:23:23,960
Race someone slow.

2803
04:23:23,960 --> 04:23:25,960
Oh, wait, you'll be able to stash away the cookies.

2804
04:23:27,960 --> 04:23:30,960
Oh, you don't need a boss! Anyway, I just want to race.

2805
04:23:36,960 --> 04:23:38,960
Come on, Poshi. Let's see what you're made of.

2806
04:23:39,960 --> 04:23:42,960
Alright, just stay out of my way. Here's the cookie stash for the winner.

2807
04:23:45,960 --> 04:23:47,960
Thank you, Mario. I finally got to beat that rascal.

2808
04:23:47,960 --> 04:23:49,960
Mario's together now.

2809
04:23:49,960 --> 04:23:51,960
Here's something to remember me by.

2810
04:23:51,960 --> 04:23:53,960
Awesome, Yoshi.

2811
04:23:53,960 --> 04:23:55,960
I'm in trouble during battles. Just one of these. Give me a call.

2812
04:24:06,960 --> 04:24:09,960
Wow, thank you, my stubborn.

2813
04:24:09,960 --> 04:24:13,960
Great. Also, yeah, actually, that instruction was horrible.

2814
04:24:19,960 --> 04:24:21,960
Haha.

2815
04:24:34,960 --> 04:24:36,960
Oh, cute animal!

2816
04:24:36,960 --> 04:24:38,960
I kinda went to the mountain with a little mic.

2817
04:24:38,960 --> 04:24:41,960
The star cached in the mountain, now they'd be trapped.

2818
04:24:43,960 --> 04:24:45,960
Pan coins for a night, y'all stay in the night.

2819
04:24:45,960 --> 04:24:48,960
It's like, pan coin for a night, y'all stay in the night now.

2820
04:24:49,960 --> 04:25:02,960
Come on in, don't be shy. Everyone up in the mountain, but I'm stuck mountain in the store.

2821
04:25:02,960 --> 04:25:04,960
So what you need?

2822
04:25:04,960 --> 04:25:06,960
Bye.

2823
04:25:06,960 --> 04:25:08,960
Mid mushroom.

2824
04:25:10,960 --> 04:25:12,960
Maple syrup.

2825
04:25:16,960 --> 04:25:18,960
Punch glove.

2826
04:25:19,960 --> 04:25:21,960
Symbols.

2827
04:25:21,960 --> 04:25:23,960
Your shot.

2828
04:25:25,960 --> 04:25:27,960
I already have that.

2829
04:25:27,960 --> 04:25:29,960
Mega shirt.

2830
04:25:29,960 --> 04:25:31,960
Ant.

2831
04:25:31,960 --> 04:25:33,960
Orc ants.

2832
04:25:33,960 --> 04:25:35,960
Take a cape.

2833
04:25:35,960 --> 04:25:37,960
Would these be any better?

2834
04:25:45,960 --> 04:25:47,960
Orc ants are pretty good at this point, you think so?

2835
04:26:05,960 --> 04:26:16,960
Should I give them a Gino, cause like, it goes up for everything.

2836
04:26:27,960 --> 04:26:30,960
It's an emergency, Diana's trapped in the mines.

2837
04:26:31,960 --> 04:26:35,960
I'm also getting pretty tired, some pie.

2838
04:26:43,960 --> 04:26:45,960
What is here?

2839
04:26:45,960 --> 04:26:47,960
It's because they're all trapped in the mine.

2840
04:26:52,960 --> 04:26:54,960
What do you start crashing down into the mountain?

2841
04:26:54,960 --> 04:26:57,960
I wanna see, but Ma told me it was too dangerous.

2842
04:26:57,960 --> 04:27:02,960
I said you go and find out what's happening, but she's sure taking her sweet time.

2843
04:27:03,960 --> 04:27:07,960
What am I even doing with these voices?

2844
04:27:23,960 --> 04:27:25,960
Bowser.

2845
04:27:25,960 --> 04:27:28,960
Most of our allies have rounded out, what do we do?

2846
04:27:28,960 --> 04:27:33,960
You only end experience finding Mario, these new guys are too much.

2847
04:27:33,960 --> 04:27:35,960
Shut up, all of you.

2848
04:27:35,960 --> 04:27:39,960
I'm the biggest baddest brute around, and don't you forget it.

2849
04:27:39,960 --> 04:27:42,960
Mario hears that I've been kicked out of my own castle.

2850
04:27:42,960 --> 04:27:45,960
My reputation will be ruined.

2851
04:27:45,960 --> 04:27:49,960
Even I have an image to keep up, you know?

2852
04:27:49,960 --> 04:27:51,960
Let him show him who's boss around here.

2853
04:27:52,960 --> 04:27:54,960
He's so cute.

2854
04:28:00,960 --> 04:28:02,960
Oh, he's so cute.

2855
04:28:05,960 --> 04:28:08,960
Star trapped in the mountain, trapped some kids inside.

2856
04:28:08,960 --> 04:28:12,960
Make things worse, one of the men folk be stuck inside too.

2857
04:28:12,960 --> 04:28:14,960
Please Mario, you gotta help us.

2858
04:28:17,960 --> 04:28:20,960
What's happening up there, is she working up a sweat?

2859
04:28:20,960 --> 04:28:23,960
And so are the men, everyone's digging and digging.

2860
04:28:23,960 --> 04:28:25,960
I keep up with them.

2861
04:28:28,960 --> 04:28:30,960
I knew it was bad news when the star fell in the mountain.

2862
04:28:30,960 --> 04:28:32,960
Fair enough it's causing trouble.

2863
04:28:37,960 --> 04:28:41,960
And folk are doing their best from the inside, I'm digging in from the outside.

2864
04:28:41,960 --> 04:28:44,960
Gotta help them folks out.

2865
04:28:45,960 --> 04:28:46,960
Alright.

2866
04:28:46,960 --> 04:28:47,960
Alright.

2867
04:28:48,960 --> 04:28:49,960
Alright.

2868
04:28:51,960 --> 04:28:53,960
Guess...

2869
04:28:54,960 --> 04:28:56,960
Am I helping?

2870
04:28:59,960 --> 04:29:01,960
From the inside?

2871
04:29:03,960 --> 04:29:06,960
Oh dear, I sure hope the kids are okay.

2872
04:29:06,960 --> 04:29:08,960
I know how you're feeling.

2873
04:29:08,960 --> 04:29:11,960
I know how you're feeling, but more around here ain't gonna help thing.

2874
04:29:21,960 --> 04:29:25,960
I know what I said, but I don't think I'll be feeling any different if I were her.

2875
04:29:25,960 --> 04:29:28,960
I'm getting nowhere fast, I'm gonna have to reach the kids at this rate.

2876
04:29:28,960 --> 04:29:32,960
Look at that thing, that's up there, their own entrance to mine.

2877
04:29:33,960 --> 04:29:35,960
Oh, we can't reach it anymore.

2878
04:29:35,960 --> 04:29:39,960
Only that fellow on Mario over here, he can reach that in heartbeat.

2879
04:29:40,960 --> 04:29:41,960
What?

2880
04:29:41,960 --> 04:29:43,960
Well, speak of the devil.

2881
04:29:43,960 --> 04:29:45,960
What are you doing?

2882
04:29:46,960 --> 04:29:49,960
I'll be a goomba's uncle if it ain't him in the flesh.

2883
04:29:49,960 --> 04:29:51,960
Mario, you're a life saver.

2884
04:29:51,960 --> 04:29:53,960
Mario, have you heard the news?

2885
04:29:53,960 --> 04:29:55,960
News, what news?

2886
04:29:55,960 --> 04:29:59,960
Oh, Don took her little bro, they're into the mine so they can play.

2887
04:29:59,960 --> 04:30:03,960
And then a huge star crashed into the mountain causing a big cave, and now they're trapped inside.

2888
04:30:03,960 --> 04:30:07,960
Now their daddy who's looking for him is trapped too.

2889
04:30:07,960 --> 04:30:09,960
Mario, will you help rescue them?

2890
04:30:09,960 --> 04:30:10,960
Of course.

2891
04:30:10,960 --> 04:30:13,960
Thanks Mario, well the entrance is up there.

2892
04:30:14,960 --> 04:30:16,960
Well, help on our shoulders.

2893
04:30:18,960 --> 04:30:20,960
Yeah, we got it.

2894
04:30:22,960 --> 04:30:24,960
Imagine me saying no.

2895
04:30:31,960 --> 04:30:33,960
I feel like I'm in the wrong game.

2896
04:30:33,960 --> 04:30:36,960
I'm pretty sure these are star me's.

2897
04:30:36,960 --> 04:30:39,960
I'm pretty sure these are star me's.

2898
04:30:45,960 --> 04:30:46,960
Bye bye.

2899
04:30:46,960 --> 04:30:48,960
Bye bye.

2900
04:30:50,960 --> 04:30:53,960
Thank you for the $10 super chat.

2901
04:30:53,960 --> 04:30:57,960
It's not so daijuu, don't mind the voice, they're adorable.

2902
04:30:57,960 --> 04:30:58,960
Love.

2903
04:30:58,960 --> 04:31:00,960
Also, here's a bit more for the moving fun.

2904
04:31:00,960 --> 04:31:02,960
Thank you so much.

2905
04:31:03,960 --> 04:31:07,960
They totally are star me's, right?

2906
04:31:07,960 --> 04:31:20,960
They're like, you know, um, legally distinct star me's.

2907
04:31:20,960 --> 04:31:21,960
Hahaha.

2908
04:31:31,960 --> 04:31:32,960
Lucky.

2909
04:31:38,960 --> 04:31:40,960
Can I do triple move?

2910
04:31:50,960 --> 04:31:51,960
What?

2911
04:32:20,960 --> 04:32:22,960
What the fuck?

2912
04:32:50,960 --> 04:33:10,960
I can't believe the power of friendship did not work on rock.

2913
04:33:10,960 --> 04:33:19,960
Double your EXP, challenge the system.

2914
04:33:19,960 --> 04:33:21,960
Win big or lose it all.

2915
04:33:21,960 --> 04:33:23,960
Sure?

2916
04:33:23,960 --> 04:33:25,960
Where's Yoshi?

2917
04:33:29,960 --> 04:33:30,960
Fuck!

2918
04:33:36,960 --> 04:33:38,960
It's okay.

2919
04:33:41,960 --> 04:33:44,960
Hey, why is there a guy here?

2920
04:33:44,960 --> 04:33:45,960
Have you heard?

2921
04:33:45,960 --> 04:33:47,960
There's a rare item hidden in the mines.

2922
04:33:47,960 --> 04:33:49,960
I mean, I'm gonna sell them to someone in town.

2923
04:33:49,960 --> 04:33:51,960
I'm getting it for the money.

2924
04:33:51,960 --> 04:33:53,960
Get up here!

2925
04:34:10,960 --> 04:34:30,960
Oh shit, Malo's down.

2926
04:34:40,960 --> 04:35:07,960
It's like Malo's always down.

2927
04:35:08,960 --> 04:35:13,960
Oh, what's Gino?

2928
04:35:13,960 --> 04:35:15,960
Maybe some more defense?

2929
04:35:15,960 --> 04:35:21,960
You not, I remember you knocked down a little too much.

2930
04:35:21,960 --> 04:35:23,960
Over here.

2931
04:35:23,960 --> 04:35:25,960
Okay.

2932
04:35:26,960 --> 04:35:33,960
Errol's planting.

2933
04:35:33,960 --> 04:35:36,960
I'm so tired.

2934
04:35:36,960 --> 04:35:38,960
Ow.

2935
04:35:39,960 --> 04:35:41,960
I knocked down!

2936
04:35:41,960 --> 04:36:01,960
I'm so tired.

2937
04:36:01,960 --> 04:36:04,960
Coins, coins, beautiful coins.

2938
04:36:04,960 --> 04:36:05,960
Grab the coins.

2939
04:36:05,960 --> 04:36:06,960
That's enough.

2940
04:36:06,960 --> 04:36:09,960
Let's leave this half-way to Mario here and split.

2941
04:36:09,960 --> 04:36:17,960
Anyone got beef with that?

2942
04:36:17,960 --> 04:36:18,960
There we go.

2943
04:36:18,960 --> 04:36:20,960
Croco got us again.

2944
04:36:20,960 --> 04:36:21,960
There are coins too.

2945
04:36:21,960 --> 04:36:23,960
Let's turn this thing down and get him back.

2946
04:36:23,960 --> 04:36:31,960
Not again.

2947
04:36:31,960 --> 04:36:34,960
Old boy looks like dead in here, but not to worry.

2948
04:36:34,960 --> 04:36:36,960
Yeah, kind of bomb.

2949
04:36:36,960 --> 04:36:38,960
Never leave home without him.

2950
04:37:05,960 --> 04:37:29,960
One of them.

2951
04:37:29,960 --> 04:37:30,960
Come on.

2952
04:37:30,960 --> 04:37:31,960
No!

2953
04:37:31,960 --> 04:37:32,960
No!

2954
04:37:32,960 --> 04:37:33,960
No!

2955
04:37:38,960 --> 04:37:40,960
My money.

2956
04:37:40,960 --> 04:37:41,960
Can you wait?

2957
04:37:41,960 --> 04:37:42,960
We'll get you for this.

2958
04:37:42,960 --> 04:37:45,960
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday.

2959
04:37:45,960 --> 04:37:48,960
Now, the coins on him, but he dropped the flower tab.

2960
04:38:02,960 --> 04:38:26,960
One, really?

2961
04:38:26,960 --> 04:38:28,960
Ah

2962
04:38:56,960 --> 04:39:02,960

04:39:16,960 --> 04:39:18,960

04:54:58,080 --> 04:55:02,720
Tomorrow I have an Among Us collab with Yume plus

3038
04:55:06,160 --> 04:55:08,160
All of us are

3039
04:55:08,880 --> 04:55:10,880

3040
04:55:11,120 --> 04:55:14,560
Gonna gonna try to kill each other I guess

3041
04:55:16,640 --> 04:55:22,160
Um followed by followed by Wednesday. It's death mark again

3042
04:55:22,640 --> 04:55:27,520
And then on Friday we have a member's only stream

3043
04:55:29,200 --> 04:55:31,200
Or smt nocturne

3044
04:55:33,840 --> 04:55:44,080
So I get to to talk more about games and the smt universe and maybe we can research more about the the the demons

3045
04:55:45,040 --> 04:55:52,000
Senpai we'll talk more about the demons and stuff. So I think it will be really fun

3046
04:55:55,280 --> 04:55:59,920
Senpai so yeah, we'll see we'll see how it is. I mean like

3047
04:56:03,520 --> 04:56:06,240
It will be my first member's stream. So I hope I can make it

3048
04:56:08,080 --> 04:56:10,080
Memberable

3049
04:56:14,320 --> 04:56:16,320
I

3050
04:56:17,840 --> 04:56:19,840
Crack myself up

3051
04:56:20,000 --> 04:56:22,000
Oh

3052
04:56:41,440 --> 04:56:46,160
Okay, I'm sorry about the senpai things kind of keep going for a while. So yeah, that's

3053
04:56:47,600 --> 04:56:49,600
That is

3054
04:56:50,000 --> 04:56:53,120
That's it for this uh stream for today

3055
04:56:53,760 --> 04:57:00,240
Um, I'll probably go back to this game, but I want to finish um harvester

3056
04:57:01,680 --> 04:57:02,640
Na

3057
04:57:02,640 --> 04:57:08,960
Next week maybe yes, and we'll see what other games there there are now

3058
04:57:13,360 --> 04:57:17,280
How is the slower schedule been easier on you? Yes. Yes. Yes. It's been quite

3059
04:57:18,000 --> 04:57:21,440
Um easier and I have more time to do outside work

3060
04:57:22,080 --> 04:57:24,720
um, that's aside from um screening

3061
04:57:25,600 --> 04:57:31,040
So I get to catch up on work that I've been meaning to catch up on uh, that's

3062
04:57:32,000 --> 04:57:34,000
that's uh

3063
04:57:35,120 --> 04:57:41,200
Like a lot of audio a lot of audio stuff and also catching up on chores that that I should have been doing

3064
04:57:43,280 --> 04:57:45,280
But I've been so busy

3065
04:57:47,440 --> 04:57:49,440
So

3066
04:57:49,760 --> 04:57:54,320
But yeah, I'm hoping to to ramp it up a little later. Maybe

3067
04:57:55,360 --> 04:57:58,400
More relaxing too. Yeah, I need like

3068
04:57:59,920 --> 04:58:05,280
Sometimes my days off aren't really days off. They are days to work on other things

3069
04:58:08,720 --> 04:58:11,360
I hope that makes sense. It's like

3070
04:58:13,120 --> 04:58:16,560
Maybe of the three days I have off

3071
04:58:17,280 --> 04:58:19,280
So

3072
04:58:20,640 --> 04:58:22,640
One of them is a real day off

3073
04:58:27,360 --> 04:58:29,760
So, yeah, I think

3074
04:58:35,440 --> 04:58:37,440
It's just non-streaming stuff. Yeah

3075
04:58:38,720 --> 04:58:46,560
Oh, it's free. Wow, we're free somehow. Oh, I thought it would go long on for for longer

3076
04:58:47,360 --> 04:58:49,360
Oh

3077
04:58:50,800 --> 04:58:52,800
Yeah, so

3078
04:58:58,240 --> 04:59:00,240
Ah

3079
04:59:00,560 --> 04:59:04,640
I thought it would be until you ended stream. Yeah, I thought it would be until I end the stream too

3080
04:59:04,720 --> 04:59:06,720
but uh, luckily right now

3081
04:59:06,960 --> 04:59:08,960
we're in the low and

3082
04:59:10,240 --> 04:59:17,200
And it it stopped I'm surprised honestly legitimately surprised. So hopefully this week is uh

3083
04:59:17,440 --> 04:59:24,240
Is it's gonna calm down is a little bit of a slow down calm down. It's funny because um

3084
04:59:25,920 --> 04:59:27,920
Um

3085
04:59:28,800 --> 04:59:32,880
I was only gonna have three streams this week and then and then

3086
04:59:33,600 --> 04:59:36,720
Umid plus was like do you want to play among us and I said

3087
04:59:37,520 --> 04:59:39,520
Yeah

3088
04:59:41,200 --> 04:59:43,600
So that's what happened that's what happened

3089
04:59:47,280 --> 04:59:49,280
That's what happened. I was like, uh

3090
04:59:50,160 --> 04:59:52,160
Actually, yeah

3091
04:59:52,960 --> 04:59:54,800
Amugas

3092
04:59:54,800 --> 04:59:58,880
Uh, so among us is that um a different time. So it's at

3093
04:59:59,760 --> 05:00:02,480
Instead of my regular 11 p.m. EDT

3094
05:00:03,040 --> 05:00:09,440
It's going to be at 8 p.m. EDT instead. So I hope some pies can catch that tomato

3095
05:00:17,600 --> 05:00:20,320
So be an earlier stream. So we'll probably end up

3096
05:00:21,120 --> 05:00:22,800
end earlier

3097
05:00:22,800 --> 05:00:24,800
as well and usually

3098
05:00:24,800 --> 05:00:32,000
Um, it's not that I don't like them, but usually social gatherings are very exhausting, right?

3099
05:00:33,040 --> 05:00:35,040
Tomario, thank you

3100
05:00:35,840 --> 05:00:37,840

05:00:38,160 --> 05:00:40,160

So, yeah, I hope my supplies have a good one I am so excited since

3103
05:00:54,560 --> 05:00:56,560

3104
05:01:00,000 --> 05:01:03,440

3105
