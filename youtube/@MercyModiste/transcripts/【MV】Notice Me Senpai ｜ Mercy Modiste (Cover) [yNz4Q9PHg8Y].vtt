Tenpai, I saw you at school today I took your picture, man, I snuck away

00:18.400 --> 00:24.320
I want you to notice me But I'm just someone you don't notice

00:24.320 --> 00:30.080
Well, I think I've got a rival I have to kill

00:30.080 --> 00:35.840
Please notice me, senpai Please notice me, senpai

My heart beats faster when I'm near you I get so nervous, I don't know what to do

01:05.600 --> 01:11.280
I don't mean to seem aloof I've got to push another student off the roof

01:11.280 --> 01:17.360

01:40.480 --> 01:45.480
If anyone else will die, only you and I will be left standing

01:45.480 --> 01:48.480
